DRAPE ABLE SANITARY ABSORBENT NAPKIN AND MATERIALS FOR USE IN DRAPEABLE SANITARY ABSORBENT ARTICLES<br>
CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION<br>
This application claims priority to Application No. 60/610,315 filed on September 16,2004.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention generally relates to sanitary absorbent articles and in particular to feminine sanitary absorbent napkins that are thin, highly absorbent and drapeable. The present invention also relates to materials for use in drapeable sanitary absorbent articles.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Externally worn, sanitary absorbent napkins are one of many kinds of feminine protection devices currently available. The development of materials having a high liquid absorption capacity per unit volume has allowed the required overall thickness of sanitary napkins to be reduced, thereby providing a product which is more comfortable and less obtrusive to wear. Thin, flexible, sanitary napkins of this type are disclosed, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 4,950,264 (hereinafter "the '264 patent") to T.W. Osborne III.<br>
The term "flexible" as used in the prior art is generally used to describe an article's resistance to deformation when an external load is applied thereto. For example, the '264 patent purports to disclose a sanitary napkin having a "low flexural resistance" when an external load is applied to the sanitary napkin by means of a plunger mechanism.<br><br>
WO 2006/034096	PCT/US2005/033281<br>
However a "flexible" definition of the type provided in the '264 patent does not measure the overall "drapeable" characteristics of an absorbent article. That is, an article may have a "low flexural resistance" and yet not be "drapeable" as defined herein. The term "drapeable" or "drapeability" as used herein means the tendency of an article to hang in a vertical fashion due to gravity when held in a cantilevered manner from one end of said article. Drapeable articles also tend to conform to the shape of an abutting surface, for example a drapeable sanitary napkin will tend to conform to the body during use, thereby enhancing comfort.<br>
Textile fabrics, and other cloth-like materials, which are used in clothing, tend to posses this "drapeable" characteristic. Clothing made from textile fabrics possessing this "drapeable" characteristic tend to conform to, and move with, to the wearer, resulting in enhanced comfort to the user.<br>
An absorbent article possessing these "drapeable" characteristics may increase comfort to the wearer. That is, an article that is sufficiently "drapeable" such that it conforms to the space defined between the user's thighs and the user's undergarment, may increase the comfort to the wearer. In contrast, if an absorbent article is not sufficiently drapeable the wearer may experience discomfort and be conscious of the absorbent article. Additionally, if such article bunches or deforms, there is a tendency to maintain its resulting shape, thereby providinginadequate protection.<br>
Thus, although the prior art may disclose "flexible" absorbent articles, there is still a need for absorbent articles, and in particular sanitary napkins, that are drapeable and also possess the absorbency attributes required of such absorbent articles. There is also a need for materials for use in drapeable absorbent articles.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Preferred embodiments of the present invention comprise absorbent articles, and in particular sanitary napkins, that are thin, flexible, drapeable and possess absorbency attributes required of sanitary napkins.<br>
According to the present invention it has been found that a sanitary napkin that is drapeable, and possesses the absorbency attributes required of sanitary napkins, will satisfy one of the following equations:<br>
AI &gt; 2.37 - 0.77 ln(BW/MCB), where BW/MCB is 
AI &gt; 1.0, where BW/MCB is &gt; 5.9.<br>
The above equations hold true where the absorbent article has a thickness of less than or equal to 2.5 mm.<br>
4<br><br>
WO 2006/034096	PCT/US2005/033281<br>
In the above equations, the identified variables have the following meanings:<br>
MCB= Modified Circular Bend Stiffness;<br>
BW = Basis Weight of the Article; and<br>
AI= Absorbency Index (as defined below).<br>
The methods for calculating the above variables for a given absorbent article are described in greater detail below.<br>
Test Procedure<br>
To test an absorbent article according to the test method set forth herein a minimum of six samples are required. For each of the tests conducted herein, the portion of the absorbent article to tested should be the same, i.e. the test sample should be taken from corresponding locations on each of the product samples. An absorbent article satisfies the test method set forth herein if any absorbent portion of the product satisfies the test<br>
Procedure for Measuring Modified Circular Bend Stiffness (MCB) and Basis Weight (BW)<br>
Modified Circular Bend Stiffness (MCB) is determined by a test that is modeled after the ASTM D 4032-82 CIRCULAR BEND PROCEDURE, the procedure being considerably modified and performed as follows. The CIRCULAR BEND PROCEDURE is a simultaneous multi-directional deformation of a material in which one face of a specimen becomes concave and the other face becomes convex. The<br>
5<br><br>
PCT/US2005/033281 WO 2006/034096<br>
CIRCULAR BEND PROCEDURE gives a force value related to flexural resistance, simultaneously averaging stiffness in all directions.<br>
The apparatus necessary for the CIRCULAR BEND PROCEDURE is a modified Circular Bend Stiffness Tester, having the following parts:<br>
1. A smooth-polished steel plate platform, which is 102.0 mm by 102.0 mm<br>
by 6.35 mm having an 18.75 mm diameter orifice. The lap edge of the orifice should be<br>
at a 45 degree angle to a depth of 4.75 mm;<br>
2. A plunger having an overall length of 72.2 mm, a diameter of 6.25 mm, a<br>
ball nose having a radius of 2.97 mm and a needle-point extending 0.88 mm therefrom<br>
having a 0.33 mm base diameter and a point having a radius of less than 0.5 mm, the<br>
plunger being mounted concentric with the orifice and having equal clearance on all<br>
sides. Note that the needle-point is merely to prevent lateral movement of the test<br>
specimen during testing. Therefore, if the needle-point significantly adversely affects the<br>
test specimen (for example, punctures an inflatable structure), than the needle-point<br>
should not be used. The bottom of the plunger should be set well above the top of the<br>
orifice plate. From this position, the downward stroke of the ball nose is to the exact<br>
bottom of the plate orifice;<br>
3. A force-measurement gauge and more specifically an Instron inverted<br>
compression load cell. The load cell has a load range of from about 0.0 to about 2000.0<br>
g;<br>
4.	An actuator and more specifically the Instron Model No. 1122 having an<br>
inverted compression load cell. The Instron 1122 is made by the Instron Engineering<br>
Corporation, Canton, Mass.<br>
6<br><br>
PCT/US2005/033281 WO 2006/034096<br>
In order to perform the procedure for this test, as explained below, three representative product samples for each article to be tested are necessary. The location of the sanitary napkin, or other absorbent article, to be tested is selected by the operator. A 37.5 mm by 37.5 mm test specimen is cut from each of the three product samples at corresponding locations. Prior to cutting the test specimens any release paper or packaging material is removed from the product-sample and any exposed adhesive, such as garment positioning adhesive, is covered with a non-tacky powder such as talc or the like. The talc should not affect the BW and MCB measurements.<br>
The test specimens should not be folded or bent by the test person, and the handling of specimens must be kept to a minimum and to the edges to avoid affecting flexural-resistance properties.<br>
The procedure for the CIRCULAR BEND PROCEDURE is as follows. The specimens are conditioned by leaving them in a room that is 2l°C, +/-1°C. and 50%, +/-2.0%, relative humidity for a period of two hours.<br>
The weight of each cut test specimen is measured in grams and divided by a factor of 0.0014. This is the basis weight in units of grams per square meter (gsm). The values obtain for basis weight for each of the test specimens is averaged to provide an. average basis weight (BW). This average basis weight (BW) may then be utilized in the formulas set forth above.<br>
A test specimen is centered on the orifice platform below the plunger such that the body facing layer of the test specimen facing the plunger and the barrier of the specimen is facing the platform. The plunger speed is set at 50.0 cm per minute per full<br>
7<br><br>
WO 2006/034096	PCT/US2005/033281<br>
stroke length. The indicator zero is checked and adjusted, if necessary. The plunger is actuated. Touching the test specimen during the testing should be avoided. The maximum force reading to the nearest gram is recorded. The above steps are repeated until all of three test specimens have been tested. An average is then taken from the three test values recorded to provide an average MCB stiffness. This average MCB value may then be used in the formulas set forth above.<br>
The remaining non-tested product samples are then used for the Absorbency Index test set forth below.<br>
Procedure for Determining Absorbency Index (AD<br>
In order for a absorbent article to function properly it must have good absorbent properties to give the user confident protection against soiling of garments and leakage. The "Absorbency Index" (AI) (as defined herein) of an absorbent article is a measure of the articles fluid handling properties. The Absorbency Index (AI) of an absorbent article is determined from composite of two fluid handling properties, Rewet (R) and Fluid Penetration Time (FPT). The Absorbency Index (AI) as used herein is defined as follows:<br><br>
R = Rewet Value<br>
FPT = Fluid Penetration Time<br>
The methods for determining the Rewet Value (R) and the Fluid Penetration Time (FPT) for an absorbent article are provided below. Three new product samples are required to conduct the Rewet Value (R) and Fluid Penetration Time (FPT) tests described below.<br>
8<br><br>
WO 2006/034096	PCT/US2005/033281<br>
Procedure for Measuring Fluid Penetration Time<br>
Fluid Penetration Time is measured by placing a sample to be tested under a Fluid Penetration Test orifice plate. The orifice plate consists of a 7.6 cm X 25.4 cm plate of 1.3 cm thick polycarbonate with an elliptical orifice in its center. The elliptical orifice measures 3.8 cm along its major axis and 1.9 cm along its minor axis. The orifice plate is arranged on the product sample to be tested at a corresponding location on the absorbent article from which the 37 mm X 37 mm test specimens were taken from the product samples tested in the MCB test described above. The longitudinal axis of the elliptical orifice is arranged parallel to the longitudinal axis of the product to be tested.<br>
Test fluid was made of the following mixture lo simulate bodily fluids: 49.5% of 0.9% sodium chloride solution (VWR catalog # VW 3257-7), 49.05% Glycerin (Emery 917), I % Phenoxyethanol (Clariant Corporation Phenoxetol(tm)) and 0.45% Sodium Chloride (Baker sodium chloride crystal # 9624-05).<br>
A graduated 10 cc syringe containing 7 ml of test fluid is held over the orifice plate such that the exit of the syringe is approximately 3 inches above the orifice. The syringe is held horizontally, parallel to the surface of the test plate. The fluid is then expelled from the syringe at a rate that allows the fluid to flow in a stream vertical to the test plate into the orifice and a stop watch is started when the fluid first touches the sample to be tested. The stop watch is stopped when a portion of the surface of the sample first becomes visible above the remaining fluid within the orifice. The elapsed time on the stop watch is the Fluid Penetration Time. The average Fluid Penetration<br>
9<br><br>
WO 2006/034096	PCT/US2005/033281<br>
Time (FPT) is calculated from taking the average of three product samples. This average FPT may then be used in the equations set forth above.<br>
Procedure for Measuring Rewet Potential<br>
The three product samples used for the Fluid Penetration Time (FPT) procedure described above are used for the Rewet Potential test described below.<br>
The rewet potential is a measure of the ability of a napkin or other article to hold liquid within its structure when the napkin contains a relatively large quantity of liquid and is subjected to external mechanical pressure. The rewet potential is determined and defined by the following procedure.<br>
The apparatus for the Rewet Potential test is the same as that set forth above with regard to the FPT test and further includes a quantity of 3 inch X 4 inch rectangles of Whatman #1 filter paper from Whatman, Inc. Clifton, NJ and a weighing machine or balance capable of weighing to an accuracy of .+-.0.001 g, a quantity of said Whatman paper, a standard weight of 2.22 kg (4.8 pounds) having dimensions 5.1 cm (2 inches) by 10.2 cm (4.0 inches) by approximately 5.4 cm (2.13 inches) which applies a pressure of 4.14kPa(0.6psi) over the 5.1 by 10.2 cm (2 inches by 4 inches) surface.<br>
For purposes of the test procedure set forth herein, the same three product samples used for the fluid penetration test should be used for the rewet potential test. After the test fluid is applied within the orifice plate in the FPT test described above, and as soon as the cover layer of the napkin first appears through the top surface of the fluid, the stop watch is started and an interval of 5 minutes is measured.<br>
10<br><br>
WO 2006/034096	PCT/US2005/033281<br>
After 5 minutes have elapsed, the orifice plate is removed and the napkin is positioned on a hard level surface with the cover layer facing upwards.<br>
A fifteen (15) layer stack of the pre-weighed filter paper is placed on and centered over the wetted area and the standard 2.22 kg weight is placed on top of the filter paper. The filter paper and the weight are arranged over the absorbent article such that they are centered over the area to which the fluid was applied. The filter paper and the weight are arranged such that their longer dimensions are aligned with the longitudinal direction of the product. Immediately after placing the paper and weight on the product, the stopwatch is started and after a 3 minute interval has elapsed the standard weight and filter paper are quickly removed. The wet weight of the filter paper is measured and recorded to the nearest 0.001 grams. The rewet value is then calculated as the difference in grams between the weight of the wet 15 layers of filter paper and the dry 15 layers of fi Iter paper.<br>
The measurement should have at least three replicates and, if necessary, the weight is wiped clean before each run. The average rewet value (R) is then calculated from the three measured values and this rewet value (R) may then be used in the equations set forth above.<br>
Procedure for Measuring the Thickness of a Sanitary Article<br>
The thickness measurement procedure described below should be conducted on three product samples prior to conducting the MCB test described above after the product samples have been removed from any packaging, any release paper has been removed, and after the product has been powdered with talc or the like. The thickness<br>
11<br><br>
PCT/US2005/033281 WO 2006/034096<br>
measurement of the product should be conducted at the same location from which the test specimen for the MCB test will be taken.<br>
The absorbent articles according to the present invention preferably have a thickness of less than 2.5 mm. The procedure for measuring the thickness of an absorbent article is described below.<br>
The apparatus required to measure the thickness of the sanitary napkin is a footed dial (thickness) gauge with stand, available from Ames, with a 2" diameter foot at a pressure of 0.07 psig and a readout accurate to 0.001". A digital type apparatus is preferred. If the sanitary napkin sample is individually folded and wrapped, the sample is unwrapped and carefully flattened by hand. The release paper is removed from the product sample and it is repositioned back gently across the positioning adhesive lines so as not to compress the sample, ensuring that the release paper lies flat across the sample. Flaps (if any) are not considered when taking the thickness .<br>
The foot of the gauge is raised and the product sample is placed on the anvil such that the foot of the gauge is approximately centered on the location of interest on the product sample. When lowering the foot, care must be taken to prevent the foot dropping onto the product sample or undue force being applied. A load of 0.07 p.s.i.g. is applied to the sample and the read out is allowed to stabilize for approximately 5 seconds. The thickness reading is then taken. This procedure is repeated for at least three product samples and the average thickness is then calculated.<br>
Description of Preferred Embodiments<br>
Referring to FIGS. 1 and 2, there is shown an embodiment of the present<br>
12<br><br>
WO 2006/034096	PCT/US2005/033281<br>
invention, a feminine sanitary napkin 20.<br>
The sanitary napkin 20 has a main body 22 with a first transverse side 26 defining a front portion thereof and a second transverse side 28 defining a rear portion thereof. The main body also has two longitudinal sides, namely a longitudinal side 30 and a longitudinal side 32. The sanitary napkin 20 preferably has a thickness not exceeding about 2.5 mm, preferably the thickness is less than 2.0 mm, more preferably less than 1.5 mm.<br>
The sanitary napkin 20 has a longitudinal centerline 34 that is an imaginary line bisecting the sanitary napkin 20 in two identical halves. Projecting laterally outward from each of the longitudinal sides 30, 32 is a flap 38 and 40 respectively. The main body 22 also has an imaginary transverse centerline 36 perpendicular to the longitudinal centerline 34 and simultaneously bisecting the flaps 38, 40.<br>
As depicted in FIG. 4, the main body 22 is of a laminate construction and<br>
preferably comprises a fluid-permeable cover layer 42, an absorbent system 44 and a fluid-impervious barrier layer 50. The absorbent system 44 may comprise a single layer of material or may comprise multiple layers. For example the absorbent system may comprise a single layer core or it may include a transfer layer and a core.<br>
Main Body-Cover Layer<br>
The cover layer 42 may be a relatively low density, bulky, high-loft non-woven web material. The cover layer 42 may be composed of only one type of fiber, such as polyester or polypropylene or it may include a mixture of more than one fiber. The cover may be composed of bi-component or conjugate fibers having a low melting point<br>
13<br><br>
PCT/US2005/033281 WO 2006/034096<br>
component and a high melting point component. The fibers may be selected from a variety of natural and synthetic materials such as nylon, polyester, rayon (in combination with other fibers), cotton, acrylic fiber and the like and combinations thereof. Preferably, the cover layer 42 has a basis weight in the range of about 10 gsm to about 75 gsm.<br>
Bi-component fibers may be made up of a polyester layer and a an polyethylene sheath. The use of appropriate bi-component materials results in a fusible non-woven fabric. Examples of such fusible fabrics are described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,555,430 issued Nov. 26, 1985 to Chicopee. Using a fusible fabric increases the ease with which the cover layer may be mounted to the absorbent layer and/or to the barrier layer.<br>
The cover layer 42 preferably has a relatively high degree of wettability, although the individual fibers comprising the cover may not be particularly hydrophilic. The cover material should also contain a great number of relatively large pores. This is because the cover layer 42 is intended to take-up body fluid rapidly and transport it away from the body and the point of deposition. Therefore, the cover layer contributes little to the time taken for the napkin to absorb a given quantity of liquid (penetration time).<br>
Advantageously, the fibers which make up the cover layer 42 should not lose their physical properties when they are wetted, in other words they should not collapse or lose their resiliency when subjected to water or body fluid. The cover layer 42 may be treated to allow fluid to pass through it readily. The cover layer 42 also functions to transfer the fluid quickly to the other layers of the absorbent system 44. Thus, the cover layer 42 is advantageously wettable, hydrophilic and porous. When composed of synthetic hydrophobic fibers such as polyester or bi-component fibers, the cover layer 42 may be treated with a surfactant to impart the desired degree of wettability.<br>
14<br><br>
WO 2006/034096	PCT/US2005/033281<br>
In one preferred embodiment of the present invention the cover is made from a spunlace nonwoven material having from about 0 to about 100% polyester and from about 0 to about 100% rayon. The spunlace material may also be made from about 10% to about 65% rayon and from about 35% to about 90% polyester. In lieu of, and/or in combination with the polyester, polyethylene, polypropylene or cellulosic fiber may be used with the rayon. Optionally, the material used for the cover layer may include binders such as thermoplastic binders and latex binders.<br>
In another preferred embodiment of the present invention the cover is made from a spunlace nonwoven material and has a "fluid absorption time" (as defined below) of less than 100 s, preferably less than 50 s and most preferably less than 30 s.<br>
In another preferred embodiment of the present invention the cover is made from a spunlace nonwoven material that is composed substantially entirely of "nonabsorbent fibers" and has a "fluid absorption time" (as defined below) of less than 100 s, preferably less than 50 s and most preferably less than 30 s.<br>
The term "nonabsorbent fibers" as used herein means fibers that do not retain any fluid within the polymer matrix of the fiber body itself. Examples of suitable nonabsorbent fibers include polypropylene, polyester, polyethylene and bicomponent fibers made from combinations of polypropylene, polyester and polyethylene.<br>
The surface of the nonabsorbent fibers may be rendered "permanently wetable" (hydrophilic) via suitable surface finishing compositions, such as appropriate surfactants as well as internal surfactants. The term "permanently wetalbe" as used herein means that the surface of the fibers retain their wetable characteristics after the spunlacing<br>
15<br><br>
WO 2006/034096	PCT/US2005/033281<br>
process. Specific examples of fibers whose surface is permanently wetable are commercially available and are set forth below in the examples.<br>
Preferably spunlace materials according to the present invention include at least 20% of nonabsorbent fibers by weight that have a fiber surface that is permanently wetable, more preferably at least 35% nonabsorbent fibers by weight that have a fiber surface that is permanently wetable and most preferably at least 50% nonabsorbent fibers by weight that have a fiber surface that is permanently wetable.<br>
"Composed substantially entirely of nonabsorbent fibers" as used herein means that preferably at least 90% of the fibers by weight in the spunlace cover material are nonabsorbent, more preferably at least 95% by weight are nonabsorbent, and most preferably 100% of the fibers by weight are nonabsorbent.<br>
In another specific embodiment the cover material is a spunlace nonwoven material that contains between about 10% and 90% polypropylene fibers by weight and between 90% and 10% polyester fibers by weight, more preferably between about 35% and 65% polypropylene fibers by weight and 65% and 35% polyester fibers by weight, and the cover material has a fluid absorption time of less than 100 s, preferably less than 50 s and most preferably less than 30 s.<br>

In the those embodiments of the present invention where the cover material is a spunlace material the cover preferably has a total basis weight of about 30 gsm to about 80 gsm and more preferably about 40 gsm to about 60 gsm.<br>
Procedure for Determining Fluid Absorption Time of Cover Material<br>
As discussed above spunlace cover materials in accordance with the present<br>
invention preferably have a "fluid absorption time" (as defined below) of less than 100 s,<br>
preferably less than 50 s and most preferably less than 30 s.<br>
The procedure for determining the fluid absorption time of a cover material is<br>
provided below.<br>
First a test fluid was prepared, the test fluid having the following composition:<br>
(a) 50 g of Acrysol Gill (commercially available from Rohm &amp; Haas,<br>
Philadelphia, PA);<br>
(b) 975 g of distilled water (72.8 dynes/cm); and<br>
(c)	10 g of red dye (commercially available from Sigma-Aldrich Co., St. Louis,<br>
MO).<br>
The resulting test fluid had a value of 42 dynes/cm.<br>
The test procedure was conducted as follows:<br>
(1) A 2" by 2" swatch of the cover material is laid flat on a level surface such as a table top. No absorbent material should be arranged under the cover material since this will effect the measured fluid absorption time;<br>
17<br><br>
PCT/US2005/033281 WO 2006/034096<br>
(2) A .05 g drop of the test fluid is applied to the top surface of the material using<br>
an appropriate pipette. The terminal end of the pipette should be applied just above the<br>
top surface of the material so as to minimize the free fall of fluid but the terminal end of<br>
the pipette should not be positioned in direct abutment with the top surface of the<br>
material so as to force the test fluid into the material;<br>
(3) After the drop of test fluid is applied to the material a stop watch is started and<br>
then the stop watch is stopped when the drop of fluid has fully entered into the material.<br>
(4)	The above described process is repeated for five material samplesand the<br>
average fluid absorption time is calculated, this average being the "fluid absorption time"<br>
according to this method.<br>

The fluid absorption times for each of the above examples were determined and are provided in the chart below.<br><br>
Alternatively, the cover layer 42 can also be made of polymer film having large pores. Because of such high porosity, the film accomplishes the function of quickly transferring body fluid to the inner layers of the absorbent system. Apertured co-extruded films such described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,690,679 and available on sanitary napkins sold by Johnson &amp; Johnson Inc. of Montreal, Canada could be useful as cover layers in the present invention.<br>
The cover layer 42 may be embossed to the remainder of the absorbent system 44 in order to aid in promoting hydrophilicity by fusing the cover to the next layer. Such<br>
20<br><br>
WO 2006/034096	PCT/US2005/033281<br>
fusion may be effected locally, at a plurality of sites or over the entire contact surface of cover layer 42 and absorbent system 44. Alternatively, the cover layer 42 may be attached to the absorbent system 44 by other means such as by adhesion.<br>
Main Body -- Absorbent System<br>
The absorbent system 44 may comprise a single layer of material or may comprise multiple layers. In one embodiment, the absorbent system 44 is a blend or mixture of cellulosic fibers and superabsorbent disposed in and amongst fibers of that pulp.<br>
It is possible that the absorbent system 44 could be integrated with the cover and/or barrier such that there is essentially only a single layer structure or a two layer structure including the function of the multiple layers described herein.<br>
Cellulosic fibers that can be used in the absorbent system 44 are well known in the art and include wood pulp, cotton, flax and peat moss. Wood pulp is preferred. Pulps can be obtained from mechanical or chemi-mechanical, sulfite, kraft, pulping reject materials, organic solvent pulps, etc. Both softwood and hardwood species are useful. Softwood pulps are preferred; It is not necessary to treat cellulosic fibers with chemical debonding agents, cross-linking agents and the like for use in the present material. Some portion of the pulp may be chemically treated as discussed in US 5,916,670 to improved flexibility of the product. Flexibility of the material may also be improved by mechanically working the material or tenderizing the material. The absorbent system 44 can contain any superabsorbent polymer (SAP), which SAPs are well known in the art. For the purposes of the present invention, the term "superabsorbent polymer" (or "SAP")<br>
21<br><br>
WO 2006/034096	PCT/US2005/033281<br>
refers to materials which are capable of absorbing and retaining at least about 10 times their weight in body fluids under a 0.5 psi pressure. The superabsorbent polymer particles of the invention may be inorganic or organic crosslinked hydrophilic polymers, such as polyvinyl alcohols, polyethylene oxides, crosslinked starches, guar gum, xanthan gum, and the like. The particles may be in the form of a powder, grains, granules, or fibers. Preferred superabsorbent polymer particles for use in the present invention are crosslinked polyacrylates, such as the product offered by Sumitomo Seika Chemicals Co., Ltd. Of Osaka, Japan, under the designation of SA70N and products offered by Stockhausen Inc..<br>
The absorbent system 44 may comprise a material manufactured by using air-laying means well known in the art. In a specific example, the absorbent system 44 is an air laid material made from cellulosic fibers, bonding materials and components that cannot form a bond (nonbonding materials) with the other component materials.<br>
Examples of bonding materials include latex binders, thermoplastic particles or fibers that melt at the "process temperature" (as defined below), adhesives, or bicomponent fibers wherein at least a portion of the bicomponent fiber melts at the process temperature. The term "process temperature" as used herein means the highest temperature to which the material is subjected to during the air laying process. The process temperature may vary depending on the specific air laying process, and the process temperature is selected by those skilled in the art for a particular air laying process, however in order for a synthetic and/or bicomponent fiber to function as "bonding materials" herein they must have a melting temperature less than the selected process temperature. For example if an airlaid material includes polyethylene fibers<br>
22<br><br>
WO 2006/034096	PCT/US2005/033281<br>
having a melting temperature of 128° C and polyester fibers having a melting temperature of 260° C and the process temperature is selected to be 160° then the polyethylene fibers would function as bonding materials and the polyester fibers would function as nonbonding materials.<br>
Examples of nonbonding materials include SAP (superabsorbent polymer), cellulosic fibers, and synthetic and bicomponent fibers having a melting temperature that is higher than the selected process temperature such that they will not melt and bond at the process temperature.<br>
Specific examples of airlaid materials according to the present invention include less than 50% cellulosic fibers by weight, less than 20% bonding materials by weight and greater 30% nonbonding materials by weight. Specific airlaid materials according to the present invention have less than 20% bonding materials by weight, more preferably less than 15% bonding materials by weight and most preferably between about 3%-10% bonding materials by weight. Specific examples of airlaid materials according to the present invention may also include an optional carrier material arranged on either or both surfaces of the cellulosic mixture. For purposes of the weight percentages provided for bonding materials and nonbinding materials herein the carrier should not be included in such calculations.<br>
Specific airlaid materials according to the present invention also preferably have a basis weight in the range of about 50 gsm to about 600 gsm and a density in the range of about 0.03 g/cc to about 0.2 g/cc. If a latex binder is used as the binding material the Tg of the latex material should be less than 25° C. Specific airlaid materials according to the present invention preferably have a thickness less than 5 mm and more preferably less<br>
23<br><br>
WO 2006/034096	PCT/US2005/033281<br>
than 3 mm. If a binding fiber, such as a bicomponent fiber, is used as the binding material then the binding fiber should have a denier per filament of equal to 3 dpf or less. Specific inventive examples of airlaid materials that may be used as the absorbent<br>
r<br>
material in the present invention are provided below.<br>
Examples of Inventive Airlaid Absorbent Materials<br>
Example Airlaid #1 - A specific airlaid absorbent material in accordance with the present invention was constructed as a 100 gsm airlaid (including carrier) containing 43 % by weight wood pulp fibers available from Weyerhauser, Seattle, Washington, • code NB416 HC 255, 3% by weight bicomponent fiber code HC255B (PE/PET) from Trevira GmbH, Hattersheim, Germany, 4 % latex binder from Vinamul Polymers a unit of National Starch and Chemical Company, Bridgewater, NJ, code Elite 21 having a Tg of-10° C, a cellu tissue carrier of 18% by weight from Cellu Tisue Holdings Inc., East Hartford Ct, and 32% by weight super absorbent polymer code M7035 from BASF Ludwigshafen, Germay.<br>
In Example Airlaid #1 described above the latex binder material functions as a bonding material and the bicomponent fibers function as a bonding material since the process temperature selected was about 140° C which is higher than the melting temperature of the PE portion of the bicomponent fibers. Thus in Airlaid Example #1 the airlaid material contains 43% cellulosic fibers, 7% bonding materials and 75% nonbonding materials (SAP + cellulosic fibers).<br>
The material of airlaid example #1 had a thickness of 2.0 mm.<br>
24<br><br>
WO 2006/034096	PCT/US2005/033281<br>
Example Airlaid #2 - A 70 gsm airlaid (excluding carrier) containing 6% KoSa 6dpf polyester fiber, 14.6% Treveria Type HC255B (PE/PET) 3 dpf bicomponent fiber, 46.5% wood pulp fibers, 28.6% SAP SA70 Sumitomo Seika, Osaka, Japan and 4.3% Vinamul Polymers A Unit of National Starch and Chemical Company Bridgewater, NJ latex binder Code 4401 with aTgof-23C. The airlaid components are cast onto a 17-gsm-tissue carrier.<br>
In Example Airlaid #2 described above the latex binder functions as a bonding material and the bicomponent fibers function as a bonding material since the process temperature selected was about 140° C which was higher than the melting temperature of the PE portion of the bicomponent fibers and less than the melting temperature of the polyester fibers. Thus in Airlaid Example #2 the airlaid material contains 46.5% cellulosic fibers, 18.9% bonding materials and 81.1% nonbonding materials (SAP + cellulosic fibers + polyester fibers).<br>
The material of airlaid example #1 had a thickness of 1.5 mm.<br>
Airlaid Example #1 and #2 were made using conventional airlaying techniques well known to those skilled in the art.<br>
It is possible that the absorbent system 44 could be integrated with the cover and/or barrier such that there is essentially only a single layer structure or a two layer structure including the function of the multiple layers described herein.<br>
Main Body-Barrier Layer<br>
Underlying the absorbent layer 44 is a barrier layer 50 comprising liquid-impervious film material so as to prevent liquid that is entrapped in the absorbent system<br>
25<br><br>
PCT/US2005/033281 WO 2006/034096<br>
44 from egressing the sanitary napkin and staining the wearer's undergarment. The barrier layer 50 is preferably made of polymeric film, although it may be made of liquid impervious, air-permeable material such as repellent-treated non-woven or micropore films or foams.<br>
Positioning adhesive 58 may be applied to a garment facing side of the barrier layer for securing the napkin 20 to the garment during use. The positioning adhesive 58 may be covered with removable release paper 60 so that the positioning adhesive is covered by the removable release paper 60 prior to use.<br>
The barrier layer may be breathable, i.e., permits vapor to transpire. Known materials for this purpose include nonwoven materials and microporous films in which microporosity is created by, inter alia, stretching an oriented film. Single or multiple layers of permeable films, fabrics, melt-blown materials, and combinations thereof that provide a tortuous path, and/or whose surface characteristics provide a liquid surface repellent to the penetration of liquids may also be used to provide a breathable backsheet. The cover layer 42 and the barrier layer 50 are joined along their marginal portions so as to form an enclosure or flange seal that maintains the absorbent layer 44 captive. The joint may be made by means of adhesives, heat-bonding, ultrasonic bonding, radio frequency sealing, mechanical crimping, and the like and combinations thereof.<br>
Main Body - Stabilising r *yPr<br>
As shown in Figures 5 and 6, the sanitary napkin 20 may further optionally include a stabilizing layer 52 arranged between the cover layer 42 and the barrier 50. The stabilizing layer 52 may be arranged between the absorbent system 44 and the cover<br>
26<br><br>
WO 2006/034096	PCT/US2005/033281<br>
layer 42 or it may be arranged between the absorbent system 44 and the barrier 50. The stabilizing layer 52 is intended to provided the napkin with a higher flexural resistance (MCB) in a localized area. The stabilizing layer 52 is intended to enhance the structural integrity of the napkin 20 in a localized area while at the same time still permitting the overall nature of the napkin to be "drapeable".<br>
The stabilizing layer 52 preferably has a length LI that is less than a length L2 of the absorbent system 44. In this manner, the napkin generally has a first portion 54 that is located outside the dimensions of the stabilizing layer 52 and a second portion 56 located within the dimensions of the stabilizing layer 52. The material for the stabilizing layer 52 is selected such that the napkin 20 has a flexural resistance (MCB) that is greater within the dimensions of the stabilizing layer 52, i.e. within second portion 56, than outside the dimensions of the stabilizing layer 52, i.e. within the first portion 54.<br>
Thus, the napkin will have at least a first MCB value outside the dimensions of the stabilizing 52 and a second MCB value within the dimensions of the stabilizing layer 52, the first MCB value being less than the second MCB value. Preferably the second MCB value is at least 400 g. The MCB values of the first portion 54 and the second portion 56 may be calculated in the same manner set forth in the "Procedure for Measuring Modified Circular Bend Stiffness (MCB) and Basis Weight (BW)" set forth above.<br>
The width Wl of the stabilizing layer 52 is preferably selected such that it is the same as the width W2 of the absorbent system 44. Preferably the stabilizing layer has a length LI of at least 37.5 mmand width Wl of at least 37.5 mm.<br>
27<br><br>
WO 2006/034096	PCT/US2005/033281<br>
If the stabilizing layer 52 is arranged between the cover layer 42 and the absorbent system 44, the material comprising the stabilizing layer 52 should be selected such that it readily transmits fluid to the absorbent system 44. For example, the stabilizing layer 52 may comprise a nonwoven material including a blend or mixture of synthetic and/or cellulosic fibers. Suitable specific material compositions will be apparent to those skilled in the art.<br>
If the stabilizing layer 52 is arranged between the absorbent system 44 and the barrier 50, the material comprising the stabilizing layer may be liquid impermeable. In this manner, the stabilizing layer 52 may assist the barrier 50 in preventing fluid from escaping from the absorbent article.<br>
Alternatively, if the stabilizing layer is arranged between the absorbent system 44 and the barrier 50, the material comprising the stabilizing layer may be absorbent such that it functions as a secondary core. For example, the stabilizing layer 52 may comprise a nonwoven material including a blend or mixture of cellulosic fibers and SAP.<br>
Finally, the stabilizing layer 52 may be arranged on the outer surface of the barrier. In such an embodiment the material comprising the stabilizing layer is preferably liquid impermeable and thus functions as a secondary barrier.<br>
Absorbent articles of this invention may or may not include wings, flaps or tabs for securing the absorbent article to an undergarment. Wings, also called, among other things, flaps or tabs, and their use in sanitary protection articles is described in U.S. Patent.

WO 2006/034096	PCT/US2005/033281<br><br>
Procedure for Measuring Average Absorbent Capacity (AC)<br>
Each of the inventive sample products 1-4 and comparative sample products 1-6 were further tested to determine the average absorbent capacity (AC) of the products. The test method for determining the average absorbent capacity (AC) is set forth below.<br>
At least three new product samples, are required to the conduct the average absorbent capacity test described below.<br>
The average absorbent capacity test is conducted on 37.5 mm X 37.5 mm square test specimens cut from the product sample. The cut square 37.5 mm X 37.5 mm test specimens are taken from the corresponding product locations as those samples taken from the products used in the MCB and AI tests described above.<br>
Prior to doing the test, at least six 60 mm X 60 mm square envelopes are constructed from a lightweight nonwoven such as 0.7 ounce per sq yard through air<br>
38<br><br>
WO 2006/034096	PCT/US2005/033281<br>
bonded web of bicomponent fibers. A suitable example of the nonwoven material is PGI code #4128. The envelope can be formed by folding a 120 mm X 60 mm square section and heat sealing the sides with the sample enclosed. Other envelope constructions can be use as long as they permit unhindered absorption of the test fluid to the sample during the submergence portion of the test and unhindered dripping during the dripping portion. An envelope, without the test specimen, is submerged in a saline solution (0.9%) for 15 minutes, and then hung so that saline can freely drip for 12 minutes. The wet weight of the envelope is then measured to the nearest one hundredth of a gram. This<br>
procedure is conducted for three envelope samples and the average wet weight of the<br>
i<br>
envelope is determined.<br>
The weight of each of the three dry 37.5 mm X 37.5 mm test specimens is measured before beginning the test.<br>
A 37.5 mm X 37.5 mm test specimen is inserted in an dry envelope and the envelope is submerged in a saline solution (0.9%) for 15 minutes and then hung so that saline can freely drip for 12 minutes. The wet weight of the combined envelope and test specimen are then measured to the nearest one hundredth of a gram. The dry weight of the test specimen and the average wet weight of the envelope alone are then subtracted to determine the absorbent capacity of the test specimen. This is repeated for three 37.5 mm X 37.5 mm test specimens and the absorbent capacity average is taken to provide the average absorbent capacity (AC). A chart is provided below which provides the average absorbent capacity (AC) for each of the inventive sample products 1-4 and comparative sample products 1 -6.<br>
