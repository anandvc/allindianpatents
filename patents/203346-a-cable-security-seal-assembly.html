				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a cable security seal assembly and in particular to a durable and effective strong, versatile barrier seal which provides a highly effective means for preventing violation and tampering of various utilities which affect users in general adversely leading to considerable financial, material and energy fosses apart from relieving from mental anxieties of possible tampering / violation. This assembly provides a selective combination of features, which are supposed to take care of the limitations and drawbacks associated with conventional cable seal assemblies presently in use. The assembly is simple to obtain and involves cost effective material like aluminum, non-corrosive galvanized iron (GI) aircraft cable, magnesium wire, etc and can be applied for effective sealing manually with less effort and avoid the need for complex and cost -extensive sealing devices.<br>
It is well known to use various sealing means to secure articles against pilferage and / or tampering. Locks or padlocks were most commonly used, but these were not entirely pilfer-proof as unscrupulous persons resorted to making duplicate keys and opening of locks in matter of seconds only. This would be evident from the considerable amount of money spent by the Railways for their fastening devices, which had to be made according to the slots available. However, in spite of that the seals applied were not entirely tamper-proof.<br>
US 5,222,776 discloses a seal and lock, which includes a flexible metal cable held permanently at one end in a housing, the other end being intertable through the housing and is locked therein by a spring-biased ball which wedges against the cable upon an attempt to pull the cable from the housing. A second  ball is located between the spring and the first-mentioned ball, and wedges against the cable to further prevent removal thereof and to prevent twisting of the cable as a way of removing the cable from the housing. The second ball is of sufficiently soft material so that the cable when pulled digs into the second ball to increase the jamming force against the cable.<br>
It would be clearly apparent from the construction of the said cable seal ofUS 5,222,776 that the same involves very complex and cost extensive mechanism and accordingly it had limitations in serving as a widely affordable and simple to manufacture sealing unit.<br>
GB2336622 discloses a cable security seal wherein a body is provided with a threaded bore which intersects a through passage, and a threaded locking member is adapted to be screwed into the bore to damp superimposed end portions of a cable against an opposed wall of the passage.<br>
1<br><br>
It would be apparent from the construction of the seal of GB2336822 that the same does meet the requirement of a simple and readily obtainable sealing unit for wide application. However, it is found that the construction disclosed and claimed of the seal essentially required that both the ends of the cable need to traverse through a single passage such that in the region of the bore the cable has a pair of superimposed ends of the same cable for sealing purposes. Such an arrangement required effective cooperative sealing of not one but two superimposed regions of the cable with respect to the opposed wall of the single passage. This necessarily tended to affect the quality and purpose of the seal since the key had to seal two not one end of the cable. Thus a little loosening of one of the superimposed regions resulted-possible tampering of the entire seal unit Also it is found that inner end of the locking member comprising of a clamp face of a configuration complementary to that of the recess was not effective in achieving the required sealing force for an effective seal. Moreover considering that both the ends of the seal were to be effectively sealed together be the user, it was difficult for the user to maintain the cable ends in position after securing the target to be sealed .<br>
The present invention aims at overcoming the difficulties and defects envisaged by the above available sealing means and provide a simple yet effective tamper-proof locking or sealing means which is easy to use and is cost effective.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION:<br>
The principal object of this invention is to provide an easy to insert cable security seal assembly which affords an effective security against tampering and / or pilferage by way of a selective combination of features directed to make on one hand the seal totally tamper proof and on the other hand make it simple and easy to apply thereby meeting the much desired need for a user friendly and safe cable seal.<br>
A further object is to provide a main body of the sea) having cross-drilled holes or recesses for holding sealing wires to be securely held by means of sheared off selective frusto-conical tip portion of the locking key-yet further object of the present invention is directed to provide a cable seal, which would have selective, and user-friendly combination of the sealing of the respective two ends of the cable used for such sealing purposes.<br>
Another object of this invention is to provide  security seal assembly which is flexible enough to secure uneven or bent door lock mechanisms or where openings are too far apart rendering other types of seal unsuitable.<br>
2<br><br>
A still another object of this invention is to provide a security seal assembly wherein breaking or shearing  off of the locking key renders it impossible to reapply the seat ence removed.<br>
Yet another object of this invention is to provide a security seal assembly in which the cable is usually ribbed affording a letter grip for the locking key tip with threading and thickness or cross section thereof may be varied according to the area and / or mode of application.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION:<br>
Thus according to the basic aspect of the present invention there is provided a cable security seal assembly comprising a main body with two separated cross drilled holes running across its entire length, said body having a threaded recess extending up to one of the said cross drilled holes and adapted to hold a metal locking key, a threaded portion of said locking key adapted to cooperate with said recess for rotatably screwing into a lock operative frusto-conical locking tip region and said threaded portion of said key in said recess, ribbed or braided metal wire or cable, passing through the said cross drilled holes one end of said wire or cable being securely held in position internally with respect to one said cross drilled hole by a plurality of seals by crimping or stamping on one of the surface of the said body, the other end of the cable adapted to be inserted, through the other cross drilled hole such that when the locking, key is tightened in said recess against said cable with said frusto-conical tip region facing said cable until the key shears off, the threaded portion and said frusto conical lock operative tip remain inside said recess thereby permanently locking the cable in said cross drilled hole.<br>
The above selective combination of the distinct sealing for the two ends of the cable and in separate passage as well as the selective frusto conical shape of the tip of the locking key provide for a safe and user friendly cable seal. In particular such a combination avoids the need for both the ends of the cable to traverse through a single passage such that in the region of the bore the cable has a pair of superimposed ends of the same cable for sealing purposes and takes care of the limitations of the prior art* The one to one sealing of the cable ends with respective independent passage coupled with the selective frusto-conical shaped key tip and sealing applied using the same provide for more secured and durable quality seal Moreover considering that both the ends of the seal were not required to be effectively sealed together in a single passage by the user, the seat unit of the invention would serve Tor user friendly and cost effective sealing.<br>
In the seal assembly of the invention one end of said wire or cable is securely held in position by a plurality of seals or stamping or pressing on one of the surfaces of the said<br>
3<br><br>
body, forming a plurality of indentation white the other end of the cable is inserted through the second cross-drilled hole and the locking key with selective frusto conical tip is tightened against cable until the tip of the key shares of giving rise to an effective, permanent seat.<br>
The main body of the security seal assembly is usually rectangular in shape with a slight bulge in the middle portion and a threaded recess is provided in one of the narrow sides of the body which is adapted to hold the threaded tip of the locking key, the said key ending in a conical tip. the aircraft cable, i.e. the ribbed or braided metal wire of desired length and cross section, is so chosen that it may easily be inserted through the cross holes drilled through the said main body of the seal. One end of the cable is security held in place by pressing or stamping over a plurality of locations across one of the said holes as a result of which the cable can hot be pulled out even with the help of suitable gadgets or equipments. The other free end of the cable may be passed through rings, holes, shots or other areas which needs security and protection against tampering and / or pilferage, and then inserted into the cross drilled hole and locked by means of the sheared off part of the locking key with said frusto-conical tip.<br>
Usually the aircraft cable used along with the main body is made of metallic iron or steel including stainless steel, the last named being used in special cases. The cable is usually available in standard high tensile cable diameter of 1.6, 2.0, 4.0 and 5.0 mm to cover a wide range or applications. Normally the cable is meant to pass through holes or slots as small as 2.0 mm, or even smaller with ease. As for the cable, normally corrosion resistant galvanised braided aircraft control cable is used as one of the components for seating.<br>
The locking key is a metal rod or wire one end of which is machined to assume a progressively tapering shape or configuration and carrying down a threaded portion having a wider cross section which in turn culminates into a selective frusto-conical tip capable of holding the metal cable securely when inserted through the cross drilled hole. The threaded frusto-conical tip of the locking key fits snugly into the threaded recess located in one of the narrower side of the main body of the seal and shears off when the locking key is tightened beyond a certain limit against the cable inserted through the cross drilled hole, thereby the cable securely held and the intended sealing is complete. "Once the operation is over, the cable security seal is "locked" and cannot be opened without destroying it. In other words, once the threaded frusto-conical tip of the locking key breaks or shears off, it is impossible to reapply the seal and thus is not meant for reuse.<br>
The main body carries ribs or indentations running parallel to each other at both ends of the broader sides thereof. The body may be made of a low-cost, malleable and / or<br>
4<br><br>
ductile metal or metal alloy such as rust resistant steel, or other ferrous or non-ferrous metal or alloy tike aluminum or art alloy thereof. The body may also be made of abrasion resistant polymers like PVC, HDP, Polypropylene or copolymers thereof, which may optionally be metal reinforced.<br>
The invention will now be more particularly described with reference to the illustrative drawings accompanying this specification wherein;<br>
