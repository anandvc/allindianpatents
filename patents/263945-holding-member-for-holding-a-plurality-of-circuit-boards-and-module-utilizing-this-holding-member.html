				<td>Specification<br>
Holding member for holding a plurality of circuit boards and module utilizing this holding<br>
member<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
[0001]<br>
The present application claims priority to Japanese Patent Application No. 2005-294377<br>
filed on October 7, 2005 and to Japanese Patent Application No. 2006-078870 filed on March<br>
22, 2006, the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference into the present<br>
specification.<br>
The present invention relates to a holding member that holds a plurality of circuit boards<br>
with a predetermined distance therebetween, and that provides an optical communication path<br>
between the circuit boards. The present invention further relates to a module wherein a plurality<br>
of circuit boards is held by a holding member such that optical communication is possible.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
[0002]<br>
Modules are being developed wherein a plurality of circuit boards mounting circuits<br>
consisting of electronic and electric components, etc. are stacked with a predetermined distance<br>
between the circuit boards. In this type of module, the circuit boards are held parallel to one<br>
another by a holding member. Compared to the case where a plurality of circuit boards is<br>
disposed on the same plane, stacking the plurality of circuit boards by means of the holding<br>
member allows this module to save space. This type of module is utilized while housed within a<br>
housing or the like. For example, this type of module is utilized in an information processing<br>
device mounted in a vehicle, etc.<br>
It is desirable that a large amount of information is transmitted accurately between the<br>
stacked circuit boards. Japanese Utility Model Application Laid-Open Publication No. 1993-<br>
77954 teaches a module in which a light receiving element and a light emitting element are<br>
utilized to transmit information between circuit boards. In this module, the light emitting element<br>
is disposed on one circuit board and the light receiving element is disposed on an other circuit<br>
board. From a plan view, the light emitting element and the light receiving element are disposed<br>
so as to overlap. In the technique set forth in Japanese Utility Model Application Laid-Open<br>
Publication No. 1993-77954, an optical signal emitted from the light emitting element is received<br><br>
by the light receiving element, thereby realizing optical communication between the circuit<br>
boards. In the module of Japanese Utility Model Application Laid-Open Publication No. 1993-<br>
77954, the optical signal travels through a space between the circuit boards.<br>
Disclosure of the Invention<br>
Problem to be Solved by the Invention<br>
[0003]<br>
The module of Japanese Utility Model Application Laid-Open Publication No. 1993-77954<br>
has the problem that it is difficult to dispose the light emitting element and the light receiving<br>
element with a positional relationship such that they overlap from a plan view. In the technique<br>
of Japanese Utility Model Application Laid-Open Publication No. 1993-77954, the circuit boards<br>
are held by a holding member (termed supporting column in Japanese Utility Model Application<br>
Laid-Open Publication No. 1993-77954). As a result, if the positional relationship between the<br>
holding member and the light emitting element in a horizontal direction is formed accurately to<br>
have a positional relationship that was determined in advance, and if the positional relationship<br>
between the holding member and the light receiving element in a horizontal direction is formed<br>
accurately to have a positional relationship that was determined in advance, the positional<br>
relationship between the light emitting element and the light receiving element can be made such<br>
that the two are disposed so as to overlap from a plan view. However, if the horizontal positional<br>
relationship of any of these deviates from the positional relationship that was determined in<br>
advance, the positional relationship between the light emitting element and the light receiving<br>
element can not be made such that the two are disposed so as to overlap from a plan view.<br>
Further, if the circuit boards expand or contract due to temperature change or the like, there is a<br>
change in the positional relationship between the light emitting element and the light receiving<br>
element, and the light emitting element and the light receiving element deviate from a facing<br>
positional relationship. If the positional relationship of the light emitting element and the light<br>
receiving element is unstable, the transmission and reception of the optical signal becomes<br>
unstable. In the technique of Japanese Utility Model Application Laid-Open Publication No.<br>
1993-77954, the optical communication has a low degree of stability.<br>
The present invention teaches a technique for holding the circuit boards such that stable<br>
optical communication between the circuit boards is ensured.<br>
Means to Solve the Problem<br>
[0004]<br>
2<br><br>
The technique taught in the present specification comprises an optical waveguide for optical<br>
signals to travel within a holding member that holds circuit boards.<br>
The holding member taught in the present specification has the dual role of mechanically<br>
holding the circuit boards, and of providing an optical communication path along which optical<br>
signals travel. The holding member taught in the present specification has no need for a difficult<br>
construction as is the case with Japanese Utility Model Application Laid-Open Publication No.<br>
1993-77954, in which the horizontal positional relationship between the holding member and the<br>
light emitting element and the horizontal positional relationship between the holding member<br>
and the light receiving element must be fixed accurately. Further, the holding member taught in<br>
the present specification is capable of maintaining an optical communication function utilizing<br>
the optical waveguide formed in the holding member even if the circuit boards expand or<br>
contract due to change in temperature, etc. As a result, information can be accurately transmitted<br>
between the circuit boards if the holding member taught in the present specification is utilized.<br>
Moreover, the technique taught in the present specification is suitable for transmission<br>
techniques utilizing either single wavelength or multi wavelength optical signals. The technical<br>
scope of the technique taught in the present specification does not restrict the type of optical<br>
signal.<br>
[0005]<br>
The holding member taught in the present specification comprises a body and an optical<br>
waveguide penetrating the body. The holding member holds a plurality of circuit boards with a<br>
predetermined distance therebetween. When the plurality of circuit boards are held by the<br>
holding member, the optical communication path is provided between the circuit boards wherein<br>
the optical waveguide penetrates the body.<br>
The holding member taught in the present specification can mechanically hold the circuit<br>
boards such that they are separated by a predetermined distance. Further, the holding member<br>
taught in the present specification can provide the optical communication path extending<br>
between the circuit boards by utilizing the optical waveguide that penetrates the body. The<br>
holding member taught in the present specification can hold the circuit boards such that optical<br>
communication is possible.<br>
[0006]<br>
Plastic fiber may be utilized as the optical waveguide within the holding member.<br>
Plastic fiber is a material that is flexible and easily worked. When plastic fiber is utilized, it<br>
is possible to form holding members in many shapes.<br>
[0007]<br>
3<br><br>
It is preferred that the holding member comprises a first reflecting means. The first reflecting<br>
means is disposed within the optical waveguide, and reflects at least a part of an optical signal<br>
traveling along the optical waveguide toward an outside of the optical waveguide. It is preferred<br>
that the holding member further comprises a light receiving element. The light receiving element<br>
is disposed at the outside of the optical waveguide, and converts the optical signal reflected by<br>
the first reflecting means into an electrical signal.<br>
The first reflecting means and the light receiving element are capable of converting the<br>
optical signal traveling along the optical waveguide into an electrical signal. The electrical signal<br>
converted by the first reflecting means and the light receiving element is transmitted to a circuit<br>
on a circuit board connected with the light receiving element.<br>
[0008]<br>
It is preferred that the first reflecting means comprises a half mirror. In this case, the first<br>
reflecting means reflects the part of the optical signal traveling along the optical waveguide and<br>
lets the remainder of the optical signal through.<br>
When the first reflecting means comprises the half mirror, the optical signal that has been let<br>
through the half mirror travels along the optical waveguide of the other holding member. When<br>
the first reflecting means comprises the half mirror, the optical signal can travel across a plurality<br>
of holding members when an optical waveguide has been constructed across a plurality of the<br>
holding members. When the first reflecting means comprises the half mirror, optical<br>
communication between the plurality of circuit boards is possible utilizing the optical waveguide<br>
that extends across the plurality of holding members.<br>
[0009]<br>
It is preferred that the first reflecting means comprises a pair of half mirrors. In this case, the<br>
first reflecting means reflects a part of the optical signal traveling along the optical waveguide<br>
from one side to the other side thereof toward the light receiving element, and reflects a part of<br>
the optical signal traveling along the optical waveguide from the other side to the one side<br>
thereof toward the light receiving element.<br>
When the first reflecting means comprises the pair of half mirrors, it is possible for the<br>
optical signals traveling in both directions to be converted by the light receiving element. When<br>
the first reflecting means comprises the pair of half mirrors, it is possible to receive information<br>
from the circuit boards disposed in both directions.<br>
[0010]<br>
It is preferred that the holding member further comprises a terminal exposed at a surface of<br>
the holding member, and a connecting wire connecting the terminal to the light receiving<br>
4<br><br>
element. The holding member can thus ensure that a wire which electrically connects the light<br>
receiving element to the circuit board is provided. The optical signal that travels along the optical<br>
waveguide is converted into the electrical signal by the light receiving element, and is transmitted<br>
to a circuit on the circuit board via this connecting wire.<br>
[0011]<br>
It is preferred that the holding member further comprises a light emitting element. The light<br>
emitting element is disposed at an outside of the optical waveguide, and converts an electrical<br>
signal into an optical signal. It is preferred that the holding member further comprises a second<br>
reflecting means. The second reflecting means is disposed within the optical waveguide, and<br>
reflects the optical signal from the light emitting element into the optical waveguide.<br>
The second reflecting means and the light emitting element can supply the optical signal to<br>
the optical waveguide. The second reflecting means and the light emitting element can convert<br>
the electrical signal from a circuit on the circuit board connected with the light emitting element<br>
into the optical signal, and can supply this optical signal to the optical waveguide.<br>
[0012]<br>
It is preferred that the second reflecting means comprises a half mirror. In this case, the<br>
second reflecting means reflects the optical signal from the light emitting element into the optical<br>
waveguide, and lets the optical signal traveling along the optical waveguide through.<br>
When the second reflecting means comprises the half mirror, the optical signal from the light<br>
emitting element can be led along the optical waveguide, and the other optical signal traveling<br>
along the optical waveguide can be allowed through.<br>
[0013]<br>
It is preferred that the second reflecting means comprises a pair of half mirrors. In this case,<br>
the second reflecting means reflects the optical signal from the light emitting element toward one<br>
side of the optical waveguide and reflects the optical signal from the light emitting element<br>
toward the other side of the optical waveguide.<br>
When the second reflecting means comprises the pair of half mirrors, it is possible to supply<br>
the optical signal from the light emitting element in both directions along the optical waveguide.<br>
When the second reflecting means comprises the pair of half mirrors, it is possible to send<br>
information to circuit boards disposed in both directions.<br>
[0014]<br>
It is preferred that the holding member further comprises a terminal exposed at a surface of<br>
the holding member, and a connecting wire connecting the terminal to the light emitting element.<br>
The holding member can thus ensure that a wire which electrically connects the light emitting<br>
5<br><br>
element to the circuit board is provided. An electrical signal from a circuit on the circuit board is<br>
transmitted to the light emitting element via this connecting wire, and after this electrical signal<br>
is converted into an optical signal by the light emitting element, it is supplied to the optical<br>
waveguide.<br>
[0015]<br>
It is preferred that the optical waveguide comprises a first end face formed at one side end in<br>
a penetrating direction, and a second end face formed at the other side end in the penetrating<br>
direction. It is preferred that a collecting lens is disposed at the first and/or the second end face.<br>
In the case where a plurality of circuit boards are held, an optical waveguide is constructed<br>
that extends across the plurality of holding members by means of optically connecting the optical<br>
waveguide of each of the holding members. If the collecting lens is disposed at one end face of<br>
the optical waveguide, this collecting lens can prevent an optical signal radiated from that one<br>
end face of the optical waveguide (in the present specification, optical signals and signal lights<br>
have the same meaning, and are interpreted in a broad sense) from widening spatially even if a<br>
space is formed between one holding member and an other holding member. As a result, the<br>
collecting lens can cause an optical signal to travel efficiently from the end face of the one<br>
optical waveguide to the end face of the other optical waveguide. If the collecting lens is utilized,<br>
the optical waveguide constructed across the plurality of the holding members is capable of<br>
supplying stable optical communication. Further, if the collecting lenses are disposed at both end<br>
faces of the optical waveguide, it is possible to achieve the above effect for optical signals that<br>
are traveling in both directions along the optical waveguide.<br>
[0016]<br>
It is preferred that the body of the holding member comprises a first portion with a larger<br>
outer diameter and a second portion with a smaller outer diameter. When the body comprises the<br>
first portion and the second portion, a step is formed between the first portion and the second<br>
portion.<br>
The circuit board and the holding member can be assembled with a predetermined positional<br>
relationship by an inner face (or surface face) of the circuit board making contact with the step.<br>
As a result, it is possible to adjust a predetermined distance between the circuit boards based on<br>
the height of the first portion that has the larger outer diameter.<br>
[0017]<br>
It is preferred that the first portion of the holding member comprises an insert bore which<br>
receives the second portion of the other holding member. It is preferred that the insert bore<br>
extends from an end face of the first portion along the penetrating direction of the optical<br>
6<br><br>
waveguide. Further, it is preferred that the configuration of the insert bore and the configuration<br>
of the second portion substantially conform to one another. In this case, an end face of the optical<br>
waveguide of the holding member is optically connected to an end face of the optical waveguide<br>
of the other holding member when the second portion of the other holding member is inserted<br>
into the insert bore of the holding member. Here, "optically connected" is not restricted to the<br>
case where the end face of the optical waveguide of the holding member is physically connected<br>
to the end face of the optical waveguide of the other holding member, but also includes the case<br>
where these are separated by a predetermined distance, another member is therebetween, etc.<br>
When the configuration of the insert bore and the configuration of the second portion<br>
substantially conform to one another, it is possible to fit the second portion of the other holding<br>
member into the insert bore of the holding member. Further, since the insert bore of the first<br>
portion extends along the penetrating direction of the optical waveguide, it is possible to<br>
optically connect the end face of the optical waveguide of the holding member to the end face of<br>
the optical waveguide of the other holding member by inserting the second portion of the other<br>
holding member into the insert bore of the holding member. The optical waveguide can thereby<br>
extend across the plurality of holding members. Optical signals can be made to travel across the<br>
plurality of holding members even in the case where the plurality of holding members are joined<br>
together.<br>
[0018]<br>
It is preferred that the body comprises a detecting means for detecting whether the second<br>
portion of the other holding member has been inserted to a predetermined position in the insert<br>
bore of the holding member when the second portion of the other holding member has been<br>
inserted into the insert bore of the holding member. It is preferred that the body further comprises<br>
a holding means for holding the holding member and the other holding member at the<br>
predetermined position.<br>
In order for optical communication to be performed stably between the optical waveguide of<br>
the holding member and the optical waveguide of the other holding member, it is desirable that<br>
there is a satisfactory optical connection between the end face of the optical waveguide of the<br>
holding member and the end face of the optical waveguide of the other holding member. In order<br>
for satisfactory optical connection to be realized, it is desirable that the holding member and the<br>
other holding member are disposed with a predetermined positional relationship. The detecting<br>
means is capable of detecting whether the holding member and the other holding member are<br>
connected with the predetermined positional relationship. Furthermore, the body taught in the<br>
present specification comprises the holding means that holds the holding member and the other<br>
7<br><br>
holding member in the predetermined positional relationship. It is consequently possible to<br>
perform stable optical communication since the holding member and the other holding member<br>
are connected reliably in the predetermined positional relationship.<br>
[0019]<br>
It is preferred that the detecting means comprises a first penetrating hole formed in at least a<br>
portion of the first portion and extending from an outer peripheral surface of the first portion to<br>
the insert bore. It is preferred that the detecting means comprises a first projection formed upon<br>
at least a portion of an outer peripheral surface of the second portion. It is preferred that the<br>
detecting means further comprises a first engagement member disposed within the first<br>
penetrating hole, one side end of the first engagement member being exposed at the outer<br>
peripheral surface of the first portion, and the other side end of the first engagement member<br>
protruding into the insert bore. When the second portion of the other holding member is inserted<br>
into the insert bore of the holding member, the other side end of the first engagement member of<br>
the holding member is elastically deformed by the second portion of the other holding member<br>
that has been inserted. The other side end of the first engagement member of the holding member<br>
engages with the first projection of the other holding member when the second portion is inserted<br>
to the predetermined position. Further, moving the one side end of the first engagement member<br>
in a predetermined direction causes the other side end thereof to move, hence, it is possible to<br>
disengage the hdlding member and the other holding member.<br>
When the second portion of the other holding member is inserted into the insert bore of the<br>
holding member, the first engagement member that protrudes into the insert bore is pushed by the<br>
second portion that is being inserted, and elastically deforms. Further, when the second portion of<br>
the other holding member is inserted into a deep position in the insert bore of the holding<br>
member, the other side end of the first engagement member engages with the first projection of<br>
the other holding member. The holding member and the other holding member are connected<br>
when the first engagement member engages with the first projection. A user can thereby ascertain<br>
that the second portion of the other holding member has been inserted to the predetermined<br>
position in the insert bore of the holding member.<br>
Furthermore, moving the one side end of the first engagement member in the predetermined<br>
direction causes the other side end thereof to move, hence it is possible to disengage the holding<br>
member and the other holding member. If holding members are connected in a wrong sequence<br>
when a plurality of holding members is to be connected, it is thereby possible to disengage the<br>
holding members and correct their sequence.<br>
[0020]<br>
8<br><br>
It is preferred that the holding means comprises a second penetrating hole formed in at least<br>
a portion of the first portion, this second penetrating hole extending from the outer peripheral<br>
surface to the insert bore, and receiving a second engagement member. It is preferred that the<br>
holding means further comprises a second projection formed upon at least a portion of the outer<br>
peripheral surface of the second portion. When the second portion of the other holding member is<br>
inserted to the predetermined position in the insert bore of the holding member, the second<br>
projection of the other holding member engages with the second engagement member inserted<br>
through the second penetrating hole of the holding member.<br>
The holding means is capable of firmly maintaining the holding member and the other<br>
holding member in a state where they are connected with the predetermined positional<br>
relationship. As a result, it is possible for optical communication to be performed stably between<br>
the optical waveguide of the holding member and the optical waveguide of the other holding<br>
member. Further, the user can ascertain that the first projection is engaged with the first<br>
engagement member from a state of the second engagement member being inserted into the<br>
second penetrating hole.<br>
[0021]<br>
It is preferred that the holding member comprises a first terminal formed upon at least a<br>
portion of an inner surface which defines the insert bore of the first portion. It is preferred that<br>
the holding member further comprises a second terminal formed upon at least a portion of an<br>
outer peripheral surface of the second portion. It is preferred that the holding member<br>
additionally comprises a wire disposed at an outside of the optical waveguide and electrically<br>
connecting the first terminal to the second terminal. In this case, when the second portion of the<br>
other holding member is inserted into the insert bore of the holding member, the first terminal of<br>
the holding member is electrically connected to the second terminal of the other holding member.<br>
With this holding member, the first terminal of the holding member and the second terminal<br>
of the other holding member make contact when the second portion of the other holding member<br>
is inserted into the insert bore of the holding member. The wires of the plurality of holding<br>
members are electrically connected via the first terminal of the holding member and the second<br>
terminal of the other holding member when the plurality of holding members has been connected<br>
together. The wires that are electrically connected across the plurality of holding members can<br>
supply voltage to the plurality of circuit boards.<br>
Moreover, a plurality of combinations of the first terminal, the second terminal, and the wire<br>
may be formed on one holding member. When a plurality of the combinations is formed, a<br>
plurality of voltages can be supplied.<br>
9<br><br>
[0022]<br>
It is preferred that the holding member comprises a grounding wire and a power supply wire.<br>
In this case, the holding member comprises a grounding first terminal formed upon at least a<br>
portion of an inner surface which defines the insert bore, a grounding second terminal formed<br>
upon at least a portion of an outer peripheral surface of the second portion, and the grounding<br>
wire disposed at an outside of the optical waveguide and electrically connecting the grounding<br>
first terminal to the grounding second terminal. The holding member further comprises a power<br>
supply first terminal formed upon at least a portion of the inner surface which defines the insert<br>
bore, a power supply second terminal formed upon at least a portion of the outer peripheral<br>
surface of the second portion, and the power supply wire disposed at an outside of the optical<br>
waveguide and electrically connecting the power supply first terminal to the power supply second<br>
terminal. In this case, when the second portion of the other holding member is inserted into the<br>
insert bore of the holding member, the grounding first terminal of the holding member is<br>
electrically connected to the grounding second terminal of the other holding member, and the<br>
power supply first terminal of the holding member is electrically connected to the power supply<br>
second terminal of the other holding member.<br>
With this holding member, both grounding voltage and power supply voltage can be<br>
supplied to the plurality of circuit boards.<br>
[0023]<br>
It is preferred that the holding member further comprises a noise filter. The noise filter is<br>
connected to the power supply wire, and removes unnecessary components (frequency ranges<br>
that form noise).<br>
Stable power supply voltage can be supplied in the power supply wire by means of the noise<br>
filter removing the unnecessary components.<br>
[0024]<br>
It is preferred that the holding member further comprises a wiping mechanism disposed in<br>
the insert bore of the first portion. The wiping mechanism comprises a wiper, and an arm<br>
supporting the wiper from the inner surface which defines the insert bore, this arm enabling the<br>
wiper to move. In the wiping mechanism, when the second portion of the other holding member<br>
is inserted into the insert bore of the holding member, the wiper moves while making contact<br>
with the end face of the optical waveguide exposed at the end face of the second portion of the<br>
other holding member.<br>
When the wiping mechanism is disposed in the holding member, impurities or dust on the<br>
end face of the optical waveguide exposed at the end face of the second portion of the other<br>
10<br><br>
holding member can be removed when the second portion of the other holding member is<br>
inserted into the insert bore of the holding member. As a result, by removing impurities or dust<br>
adhering to the end face of the optical waveguide, it is possible to avoid noise being<br>
superimposed upon the optical signal traveling along the optical waveguide.<br>
Further, in Japanese Utility Model Application Laid -Open Publication No. 1993-77954<br>
described in the background of the invention, the optical signal travels along a space between the<br>
circuit boards. As a result, the problem occurs that noise is superimposed upon the optical signal<br>
due to dust within the space if dust, etc. is present within the space.<br>
In the holding member taught in the present specification, by contrast, the optical signal<br>
travels utilizing the optical waveguide that penetrates the body of the holding member. It is<br>
consequently possible to prevent dust, etc. from entering the optical waveguide from the exterior.<br>
When the second portion of the other holding member has been inserted into the insert bore of<br>
the holding member in the case of the holding member taught in the present specification,<br>
impurities or dust on the end face of the optical waveguide exposed at the end face of the second<br>
portion can be removed, and thereafter dust, etc. can be prevented from entering the optical<br>
signal traveling path. Since it is possible to reduce the noise superimposed upon the optical<br>
signals by impurities, dust, etc. when the holding member taught in the present specification is<br>
utilized, accurate optical signals can be made to travel.<br>
[0025]<br>
It is preferred that the body comprises a divided portion being divided from a remaining<br>
portion of the body along the penetrating direction of the optical waveguide, and an attaching<br>
means for attaching the divided portion to the remaining portion while being capable of varying<br>
the distance therebetween. The optical waveguide comprises a third end face exposed within a<br>
space between the divided portion and the remaining portion, and formed at the optical<br>
waveguide within the divided portion. The optical waveguide comprises a fourth end face<br>
exposed within the space between the divided portion and the remaining portion, and formed at<br>
the optical waveguide within the remaining portion. It is preferred that the optical waveguide<br>
further comprises a collecting lens disposed at the third and/or the fourth end face.<br>
There is often variation in the distance required between the circuit boards according to the<br>
type of circuit board and the purpose thereof. It is not necessary to provide a plurality of types of<br>
holding members if one type of holding member can be made to correspond to the various<br>
distances between differing circuit boards. The holding member taught in the present<br>
specification consists of the divided portion and the remaining portion and, by changing the<br>
distance between the divided portion and the remaining portion, the holding member can be<br>
11<br><br>
made to correspond to the various distances between differing circuit boards. The holding<br>
member taught in the present specification further has a countermeasure to prevent optical<br>
communication from becoming unstable due to the optical signal spreading spatially within the<br>
space between the divided portion and the remaining portion. That is, the collecting lens is<br>
disposed at the third and/or the fourth end face of the optical waveguide that are exposed within<br>
the space between the divided portion and the remaining portion. If the collecting lens is<br>
disposed at the third end face (or the fourth end face), this collecting lens prevents the optical<br>
signal emitted from the third end face (or the fourth end face) from spreading spatially even<br>
though a space is formed between the divided portion and the remaining portion. As a result, the<br>
collecting lens can cause the optical signal to travel efficiently from the third end face (or the<br>
fourth end face) to the fourth end face (or the third end face). Further, if the collecting lenses are<br>
disposed at both the third and the fourth end faces, the above result can be achieved for optical<br>
signals traveling in both directions along the optical waveguide.<br>
[0026]<br>
It is preferred that the attaching means comprises a first screw head formed on the divided<br>
portion, and a second screw head formed on the remaining portion. The divided portion and the<br>
remaining portion are screwed together by using the first screw head and the second screw head.<br>
The distance between the divided portion and the remaining portion can be adjusted by<br>
adjusting the degree to which the two are screwed together.<br>
[0027]<br>
The technique taught in the present specification can be realized in a module. The module<br>
taught in the present specification comprises a holding member holding circuit boards with a<br>
predetermined distance therebetween. The holding member comprises a body and an optical<br>
waveguide penetrating the body. In the module taught in the present specification, an optical<br>
signal, which the one of the circuit boards sends out and the other circuit board receives, travels<br>
along the optical waveguide of the holding member.<br>
[0028]<br>
It is preferred that the module taught in the present specification further comprises an<br>
engagement means formed on the circuit board, this engagement means holding the holding<br>
member to the circuit board by engaging with the holding member.<br>
If the engagement means is formed in advance on the circuit board, it is possible to hold the<br>
holding member to the circuit board by means of the engagement means. If the engagement<br>
means is utilized, it is not necessary, for example, to hold the holding member to the circuit<br>
board by means of soldering, etc. As a result, the thermal load of soldering, etc. is not applied to<br>
12<br><br>
the optical waveguide of the holding member, and the optical waveguide of the holding member<br>
can therefore maintain a satisfactory state. It is thus possible to provide stable optical<br>
communication by providing the engagement means on the module.<br>
[0029]<br>
The technique taught in the present specification can be realized in a series of holding<br>
members for holding a plurality of circuit boards with a predetermined distance therebetween and<br>
providing an optical communication path between the circuit boards. The series of holding<br>
members comprises four types of holding members.<br>
A first holding member includes a body, an optical waveguide, a light receiving element for<br>
converting at least a part of an optical signal traveling along the optical waveguide into an<br>
electrical signal, and a light emitting element for emitting an optical signal which is to be<br>
introduced into the optical waveguide.<br>
A second holding member includes a body, an optical waveguide, and a light receiving<br>
element for converting at least a part of an optical signal traveling along the optical waveguide<br>
into an electrical signal.<br>
A third holding member includes a body, an optical waveguide, and a light emitting element<br>
for emitting an optical signal which is to be introduced into the optical waveguide.<br>
A fourth holding member includes a body and an optical waveguide.<br>
The first, the second, the third and the fourth holding members have a common<br>
configuration, being adapted for connecting any of the holding members to any other of the<br>
holding members while holding the circuit board therebetween, and being adapted for optically<br>
connecting an end face of the optical waveguide of any of the holding members to an end face of<br>
the optical waveguide of any other of the holding members.<br>
The first to fourth holding members are selected in accordance with their suitability for the<br>
role of the circuit board. The first holding member is selected for a circuit board which sends a<br>
signal to and receives a signal from an other circuit board. The second holding member is<br>
selected for a circuit board which receives a signal from an other circuit board. The third holding<br>
member is selected for a circuit board which sends a signal to an other circuit board. The fourth<br>
holding member is selected for a circuit board which does not send a signal to and does not<br>
receive a signal from an other circuit board.<br>
It is possible to hold a plurality of circuit boards having a plurality of roles with a<br>
predetermined distance therebetween by utilizing a combination of the first to fourth holding<br>
members. Further, the holding members are capable of constructing optical waveguides between<br>
the plurality of circuit boards, and allowing information to be sent and received.<br>
13<br><br>

optical waveguide. As a result, the module taught in the present specification is capable of<br>
accurately transmitting information between the circuit boards.<br>

Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
[0033]<br>
Characteristics of the present invention will be given.<br>
(First Feature) There is no particular restriction on the material utilized in the optical<br>
waveguide. Typically, plastic fiber, glass fiber, or the like is utilized. Since the distance that the<br>
optical signals travel is short, it is preferred that plastic fiber, which has outstanding working<br>
properties, is utilized.<br>
(Second Feature) There is no particular restriction on the type of optical signals. Either<br>
single wavelength or multi wavelength optical signals may be utilized.<br>
(Third Feature) In the case where multi wavelength optical signals are utilized, a dielectric<br>
multilayer film or a diffraction grating multiplexer, etc. can suitably be utilized in the first<br>
reflecting means and/or the second reflecting means in order to divide the plurality of wavelength<br>
components.<br>
(Fourth Feature) Lenses of the following shapes can be utilized in the collecting lens: a<br>
convex lens (a biconvex or a plano-convex lens), a spherical lens, a cylindrical lens, etc. Further,<br>
the following can be utilized in the collecting lens: a distributed refractive index (grin) lens, a<br>
molded lens, etc.<br>
17<br><br>
Embodiments<br>
[0034]<br>
(First Embodiment)<br>
FIG. 1 schematically shows the configuration of a module 100. The module 100 comprises a<br>
plurality of substantially square circuit boards 20, and a plurality of substantially cylindrical<br>
holding members 10. The plurality of circuit boards 20 are stacked with a predetermined distance<br>
therebetween. The circuit boards 20 are held parallel to one another separated by the<br>
predetermined distance by means of the holding members 10. For the sake of clarity, both the<br>
circuit boards 20 and the holding members 10 prior to attachment are shown simultaneously in<br>
FIG. 1. The module 100 is housed in a housing or the like, and is utilized in an information<br>
processing device mounted in a vehicle.<br>
[0035]<br>
The circuit board 20 comprises a circuit (not shown) consisting of electronic and electric<br>
components, etc., and an opening 22 formed near a corner. The opening 22 penetrates the circuit<br>
board 20 from a surface to an inner face thereof, and the planar shape thereof is substantially<br>
round. A part of the holding member 10 is inserted into the opening 22 of the circuit board 20.<br>
The holding member 10 passes through the opening 22 and joins an other holding member 10 in<br>
an axial direction. The opening 22 is formed in a common location in each of the plurality of<br>
circuit boards 20. As a result, the contours of the stacked plurality of circuit boards 20 conform<br>
with one another when the module 100 is seen from a plan view. The circuit boards 20 are<br>
gripped above and below by the holding members 10. Alternatively, as will be described in a<br>
later embodiment, the circuit boards 20 and the holding members 10 may be held by means of a<br>
socket.<br>
[0036]<br>
FIG. 2 schematically shows an expanded perspective view of the holding member 10.<br>
The holding member 10 comprises a body 15, and an optical waveguide 12 that penetrates<br>
the body 15. The optical waveguide 12 comprises a first end face 12a formed at one end of the<br>
optical waveguide 12 in the penetrating direction (the up-down direction on the page) and a<br>
second end face 12b formed at the other end of the optical waveguide 12 in the penetrating<br>
direction (see FIG. 3 and FIG. 4). The first end face 12a is exposed at one end face of the body<br>
15. The second end face 12b is exposed at the other end face of the body 15. Plastic fiber is<br>
utilized in the optical waveguide 12. Since the plastic fiber is flexible, it is possible to obtain<br>
holding members 10 in a various shapes by utilizing this plastic fiber.<br>
18<br><br>
The body 15 of the holding member 10 comprises a first portion 16 with a larger outer<br>
diameter and a second portion 14 with a smaller outer diameter. The first portion 16 is a portion<br>
that can be considered to have a relatively large outer diameter within the entirety of the holding<br>
member 10, and the second portion 14 is a portion that can be considered to have a relatively<br>
small outer diameter within the entirety of the holding member 10. A step 18 is formed between<br>
the first portion 16 and the second portion 14 that have differing outer diameters. The outer<br>
diameter of the second portion 14 is adjusted such that it is smaller than the diameter of the<br>
opening 22 of the circuit board 20 shown in FIG. 1. The outer diameter of the first portion 16 is<br>
adjusted such that it is greater than the diameter of the opening 22 of the circuit board 20 shown<br>
in FIG. 1. The second portion 14 of the holding member 10 is therefore capable of passing<br>
through the opening 22 of the circuit board 20, and the first portion 16 of the holding member 10<br>
is not capable of passing through the opening 22 of the circuit board 20. As a result, when the<br>
holding member 10 is inserted into the opening 22 of the circuit board 20, the inner face of the<br>
circuit board 20 makes contact with the step 18 of the holding member 10. The other holding<br>
member 10 joins with the second portion 14 that protrudes from the opening 22 of the circuit<br>
board 20 (moreover, although this will be described later, the holding members 10 fit with one<br>
another). The circuit board 20 is thus gripped by the holding members 10. The distance between<br>
the holding members 10 can be adjusted by the height of the first portion 16.<br>
[0037]<br>
A plurality of types of holding member 10 are provided. FIG. 3 and FIG. 4 schematically<br>
show cross-sectional views of representative holding members 10A and 10B. The first type of<br>
holding member 10A shown in FIG. 3 comprises a light receiving portion 50 and a light emitting<br>
portion 40. The second type of holding member 10B shown in FIG. 4 does not comprise the light<br>
receiving portion 50 and the light emitting portion 40. In the case where the holding members 10<br>
are to be distinguished by their function, the holding members 10 are numbered "10A", "10B",<br>
etc. in the present specification, and are numbered "10" in the case where the holding members<br>
are to be referred to collectively without distinguishing their function.<br>
The module 100 of the present specification performs communication utilizing single<br>
wavelength optical signals. As a result, the wavelength of the light emitted by the light emitting<br>
portion 40 and the wavelength of the light received by the light receiving portion 50 are equal.<br>
[0038]<br>
The first type of holding member 10A will be described first. As shown in FIG. 3, the first<br>
type of holding member 10A comprises the light receiving portion 50 and the light emitting<br>
portion 40.<br>
19<br><br>
The light receiving portion 50 comprises a first reflecting means 58 and a light receiving<br>
element 52. The first reflecting means 58 comprises a pair of half mirrors 54 and 56 disposed<br>
within the optical waveguide 12. The half mirrors 54 and 56 are disposed obliquely with respect<br>
to the penetrating direction of the optical waveguide 12 (the up-down direction of the page). The<br>
half mirror 54 reflects the part of the optical signal traveling along the optical waveguide 12 from<br>
the bottom side to the top side of the page, and lets the remainder of the optical signal through.<br>
The part of the optical signal reflected by the half mirror 54 is converted into an electrical signal<br>
by the light receiving element 52. The optical signal that passed through the half mirror 54 can<br>
also be received by the light receiving portion 50 disposed in the other holding member 10. The<br>
half mirror 56 reflects the part of the optical signal traveling along the optical waveguide 12 from<br>
the top side to the bottom side of the page, and lets the remainder of the optical signal through.<br>
The part of the optical signal reflected by the half mirror 56 is converted into an electrical signal<br>
by the light receiving element 52. The optical signal that passed through the half mirror 56 can<br>
also be received by the light receiving portion 50 disposed in the other holding member 10. It is<br>
possible to lead optical signals traveling in both directions within the optical waveguide 12 to the<br>
light receiving element 52 by utilizing the pair of half mirrors 54 and 56. Moreover, one of the<br>
pair of half mirrors 54 and 56 can be removed as required. In this case it is possible to receive,<br>
from among the optical signals traveling within the optical waveguide 12, only the optical signals<br>
traveling in a selected direction.<br>
The light receiving element 52 is disposed at the outside of the optical waveguide 12, and is<br>
disposed in a position that does not physically obstruct the optical signals traveling along the<br>
optical waveguide 12. The light receiving element 52 and the optical waveguide 12 are optically<br>
joined via the pair of half mirrors 54 and 56. An optical-electrical converting device that utilizes<br>
a semiconductor is used in the light receiving element 52. A first signal wire 37 for fetching the<br>
converted electrical signal is electrically connected with the light receiving element 52. The first<br>
signal wire 37 passes through the holding member 10, extends to a bottom side face of the<br>
holding member 10, and an end part of the first signal wire 37 is exposed at the bottom side face<br>
of the holding member 10. A light receiving element signal terminal 86 is formed at the bottom<br>
side face of the holding member 10, and the end part of the first signal wire 37 and the light<br>
receiving element signal terminal 86 are electrically connected. The first signal wire 37 is<br>
electrically connected with the circuit disposed on the circuit board 20 via the light receiving<br>
element signal terminal 86. A sheet shaped metal terminal, a spring type metal terminal, etc. are<br>
utilized in the light receiving element signal terminal 86. The electrical signal converted by the<br>
20<br><br>
light receiving element 52 is transmitted to the circuit on the circuit board 20 via the first signal<br>
wire 37 and the light receiving element signal terminal 86.<br>
The first signal wire 37 often actually comprises two signal wires: anode and cathode. As a<br>
result, the light receiving element signal terminal 86 also often comprises two light receiving<br>
element signal terminals. For the sake of clarity in the figures, only one signal wire and one light<br>
receiving element signal terminal are shown in the present embodiment.<br>
[0039]<br>
The light emitting portion 40 comprises a light emitting element 42 and a second reflecting<br>
means 48.<br>
The light emitting element 42 is disposed at the outside of the optical waveguide 12, and is<br>
disposed in a position that does not physically obstruct the optical signals traveling along the<br>
optical waveguide 12. The light emitting element 42 and the optical waveguide 12 are joined via<br>
a pair of half mirrors 44 and 46. A semiconductor laser device that utilizes a semiconductor is<br>
used in the light emitting element 42. A second signal wire 34 for inputting an electrical signal<br>
from the circuit on the circuit board 20 is electrically connected with the light emitting element<br>
42. The second signal wire 34 passes through the holding member 10, extends to the bottom side<br>
face of the holding member 10, and an end part of the second signal wire 34 is exposed at the<br>
bottom side face of the holding member 10. A light emitting element signal terminal 84 is<br>
formed" at the bottom side face of the holding member 10, and the end part of the second signal<br>
wire 34 and the light emitting element signal terminal 84 are electrically connected. The second<br>
signal wire 34 is electrically connected with the circuit disposed on the circuit board 20 via the<br>
light emitting element signal terminal 84. A sheet shaped metal terminal, a spring type metal<br>
terminal, etc. are utilized in the light emitting element signal terminal 84. The electrical signal<br>
from the circuit on the circuit board 20 is input to the light emitting element 42 via the light<br>
emitting element signal terminal 84 and the second signal wire 34. The light emitting element 42<br>
creates an optical signal in accordance with the electrical signal that has been input.<br>
The second signal wire 34 often actually comprises two signal wires: anode and cathode. As<br>
a result, the light emitting element signal terminal 84 also often comprises two light emitting<br>
element signal terminals. For the sake of clarity in the figures, only one signal wire and one light<br>
emitting element signal terminal are shown in the present embodiment.<br>
The second reflecting means 48 comprises the pair of half mirrors 44 and 46 disposed within<br>
the optical waveguide 12. The half mirrors 44 and 46 are disposed obliquely with respect to the<br>
penetrating direction of the optical waveguide 12 (the up-down direction of the page). The half<br>
mirror 44 reflects the optical signal from the light emitting element 42 into the optical waveguide<br>
21<br><br>
12. The optical signal reflected by the half mirror 44 travels along the optical waveguide 12 from<br>
the top side to the bottom side of the page. The half mirror 44 is capable of letting through at<br>
least a part of the optical signal from the other holding member 10. As a result, the optical signal<br>
from the other holding member 10 can pass through the half mirror 44, and can travel toward the<br>
other holding member 10. The half mirror 46 reflects the optical signal from the light emitting<br>
element 42 into the optical waveguide 12. The optical signal reflected by the half mirror 46<br>
travels along the optical waveguide 12 from the bottom side to the top side of the page. The half<br>
mirror 46 is capable of letting through at least a part of the optical signal from the other holding<br>
member 10. As a result, the optical signal from the other holding member 10 can pass through<br>
the half mirror 46, and can travel toward the other holding member 10. It is possible to supply the<br>
optical signal from the light emitting element 42 into the optical waveguide 12 in both directions<br>
by utilizing the pair of half mirrors 44 and 46. Moreover, one of the pair of half mirrors 44 and<br>
46 can be removed as required. In this case it is possible to supply, from among the optical<br>
signals traveling within the optical waveguide 12, only the optical signals traveling in a selected<br>
direction.<br>
[0040]<br>
Unless there is a specific description, the compositional elements described below are<br>
provided in common in a plurality of types of the holding members 10. The common<br>
compositional elements will be described with reference to the holding member 10A of FIG. 3.<br>
As shown in FIG. 3, the first portion 16 comprises an insert bore 60 that receives the second<br>
portion 14 of the other holding member 10. The insert bore 60 extends from a bottom end face of<br>
the first portion 16 along the penetrating direction of the optical waveguide 12 (the up-down<br>
direction of the page). The second end face 12b of the optical waveguide 12 is exposed at the<br>
insert bore 60. The shape of the insert bore 60 is formed so as to substantially conform to the<br>
shape of the second portion 14.<br>
When the shape of the insert bore 60 of the first portion 16 substantially conforms to the<br>
shape of the second portion 14, the second portion 14 of the other holding member 10 can fit into<br>
the insert bore 60 of the first portion 16. Various techniques can be utilized as a joining<br>
mechanism of the insert bore 60 of the first portion 16 and the second portion 14 of the other<br>
holding member 10. For example, the following techniques for joining can be adopted: holding<br>
by means of shape, physical force such as magnetism or the like, the pressing force of a spring,<br>
etc. Further, since the insert bore 60 of the first portion 16 extends along the penetrating direction<br>
of the optical waveguide 12, when the second portion 14 of the other holding member 10 is fitted<br>
into the insert bore 60 of the first portion 16, the second end face 12b of the optical waveguide 12<br>
22<br><br>
that is exposed at the insert bore 60 of the first portion 16 is optically connected with the first end<br>
face 12a of the optical waveguide 12 that is exposed at the end face of the second portion 14 of<br>
the other holding member 10. The optical waveguides 12 of the holding members 10 can thereby<br>
extend across the plurality of holding members 10 when the second portion 14 of the other<br>
holding member 10 is fitted into the insert bore 60 of the first portion 16. It is thus possible to<br>
cause the optical signal to travel along the plurality of holding members 10 utilizing the joining<br>
optical waveguides 12 even in the case where a plurality of the holding members 10 have been<br>
joined together.<br>
[0041]<br>
As shown in FIG. 3, the holding member 10 comprises a grounding wire 33 for grounding<br>
voltage, and a power supply wire 38 for power supply voltage.<br>
One end of the grounding wire 33 is electrically connected with a grounding first terminal 35<br>
that is formed on an inner surface which defines the insert bore 60 of the first portion 16. The<br>
other end of the grounding wire 33 is electrically connected with a grounding second terminal 32<br>
that is formed on an outer surface of the second portion 14. The grounding first terminal 35<br>
forms a loop in a circumference direction in the inner surface which defines the insert bore 60.<br>
The grounding second terminal 32 forms a loop in a circumference direction in the outer surface<br>
of the second portion 14. A spring type metal terminal is utilized in the grounding first terminal<br>
35 and the grounding second terminal 32. The grounding wire 33 is disposed at the outside of the<br>
optical waveguide 12, and passes through the body 15 in an axial direction. Further, the<br>
grounding wire 33 is bifurcated, and a part of the grounding wire 33 is exposed at the bottom end<br>
face of the holding member 10. A grounding third terminal 82 is formed at the bottom end face<br>
of the holding member 10, and a part of the grounding wire 33 and the grounding third terminal<br>
82 are electrically connected. A part of the grounding wire 33 is electrically connected with the<br>
circuit disposed on the circuit board 20 via the grounding third terminal 82. A sheet shaped metal<br>
terminal, a spring type metal terminal, etc. are utilized in the grounding third terminal 82.<br>
One end of the power supply wire 38 is electrically connected with a power supply first<br>
terminal 36 that is formed on the inner surface which defines the insert bore 60 of the first<br>
portion 16. The other end of the power supply wire 38 is electrically connected with a power<br>
supply second terminal 31 that is formed on the outer surface of the second portion 14. The<br>
power supply first terminal 36 forms a loop in a circumference direction in the inner surface<br>
which defines the insert bore 60. The power supply second terminal 31 forms a loop in a<br>
circumference direction in the outer surface of the second portion 14. A spring type metal<br>
terminal is utilized in the power supply first terminal 36 and the power supply second terminal<br>
23<br><br>
31. The power supply wire 38 is disposed at the outside of the optical waveguide 12, and passes<br>
through the body 15 in an axial direction. Further, the power supply wire 38 is bifurcated, and a<br>
part of the power supply wire 38 is exposed at the bottom end face of the holding member 10. A<br>
power supply third terminal 88 is formed at the bottom end face of the holding member 10, and a<br>
part of the power supply wire 38 and the power supply third terminal 88 are electrically<br>
connected. A part of the power supply wire 38 is electrically connected with the circuit disposed<br>
on the circuit board 20 via the power supply third terminal 88. A sheet shaped metal terminal, a<br>
spring type metal terminal, etc. are utilized in the power supply third terminal 88.<br>
The grounding first terminal 35 and the power supply first terminal 36 that are formed on the<br>
inner surface which defines the insert bore 60 of the first portion 16 are offset in the axial<br>
direction of the holding member 10. As a result, the grounding first terminal 35 and the power<br>
supply first terminal 36 are electrically isolated. The grounding second terminal 32 and the power<br>
supply second terminal 31 that are formed on the outer surface of the second portion 14 are offset<br>
in the axial direction of the holding member 10. As a result, the grounding second terminal 32<br>
and the power supply second terminal 31 are electrically isolated.<br>
In the holding member 10, the grounding first terminal 35 and the grounding second<br>
terminal 32 of the other holding member 10 make contact when the second portion 14 of the<br>
other holding member 10 is fitted into the insert bore 60 of the first portion 16. Further, the<br>
power supply first terminal 36 and the power supply second terminal 31 of the other holding<br>
member 10 also make contact. The grounding wires 33 of the plurality of holding members 10<br>
are thereby electrically connected via the grounding first terminal 35 and the grounding second<br>
terminal 32 in the case where the plurality of holding members 10 have been joined together. The<br>
power supply wires 38 of the plurality of holding members 10 are also electrically connected via<br>
the power supply first terminal 36 and the power supply second terminal 31. As a result, when<br>
grounding voltage is supplied to the grounding wires 33 from the grounding first terminal 35, the<br>
grounding second terminal 32, or the grounding third terminal 82, the grounding voltage of the<br>
grounding wires 33 maintains a common amount within the plurality of joined holding members<br>
10. This grounding voltage is supplied to the circuit board 20 via the grounding third terminal 82.<br>
It is consequently possible to supply the grounding voltage that has a common amount to the<br>
plurality of circuit boards 20. When power supply voltage is supplied to the power supply wires<br>
38 from the power supply first terminal 36, the power supply second terminal 31, or the power<br>
supply third terminal 88, the power supply voltage of the power supply wires 38 maintains a<br>
common amount within the plurality of joined holding members 10. This power supply voltage is<br>
supplied to the circuit board 20 via the power supply third terminal 88. It is consequently<br>
24<br><br>
possible to supply the power supply voltage that has a common amount to the plurality of circuit<br>
boards 20. Moreover, the grounding third terminal 82 and the power supply third terminal 88<br>
may be removed from a part of the holding members 10. In this case, the circuit on the circuit<br>
board 20 can be operated by a grounding voltage and power supply voltage that are independent<br>
of the grounding wires 33 and the power supply wires 38.<br>
[0042]<br>
FIG. 4 shows a cross-sectional view of the second type of holding member 10B. Where the<br>
configuration is the same as in the first type of holding member 10A shown in FIG. 3, the same<br>
numbers are applied thereto.<br>
As shown in FIG. 4, the second type of holding member 10B does not have the light<br>
emitting portion 40 and the light receiving portion 50. The second type of holding member 10B<br>
is provided with the optical waveguide 12, and optical signals can travel therethrough. The<br>
grounding wire 33 and the power supply wire 38 are provided in the second type of holding<br>
member 10B, and grounding voltage and power supply voltage can thus be supplied to the circuit<br>
board 20. For example, it may be desirable to provide a circuit board 20 that is not used for<br>
communication within the module 100. In this type of case, it is preferred that the second type of<br>
holding member 10B is utilized. The second type of holding member 10B does not deliver<br>
information between the circuit boards 20. Optical signals from the other holding member 10 can<br>
bypass the second type of holding member 10B, and the second type of holding member 10B can<br>
cause the optical signals to travel to the other holding member 10. Further, in the case where<br>
grounding voltage and power supply voltage need to be supplied to the circuit board 20, the<br>
second type of holding member 10B can supply grounding voltage and power supply voltage to<br>
the circuit board 20 via the grounding third terminal 82 and the power supply third terminal 88.<br>
Furthermore, in addition to the two types of holding member 10A and 10B, the following<br>
holding members may be utilized: a holding member that has the light receiving portion 50 and<br>
does not have the light emitting portion 40, and a holding member that does not have the light<br>
receiving portion 50 and has the light emitting portion 40. This plurality of holding members 10<br>
can have a common exterior shape. Utilizing this plurality of types of holding members 10, it is<br>
possible to stack any of the circuit boards 20 to construct a module.<br>
[0043]<br>
FIG. 5 shows an example of the module 100 which has been constructed by stacking a<br>
plurality of circuit boards 20 utilizing a plurality of types of holding members 10. In order for the<br>
types of holding member 10 to be understood, only the light receiving element 52 and the light<br>
emitting element 42 are shown in the figure.<br>
25<br><br>
The plurality of types of holding members 10 are selected in accordance with the functions<br>
required by the circuit boards 20.<br>
Circuit boards 20 (A) and (E) are desired to have the function of sending a optical signal to<br>
and receiving an optical signal from an other circuit board 20. In this case, the holding member<br>
10 (10A) comprising both the light receiving element 52 and the light emitting element 42 is<br>
utilized in the circuit boards 20 (A) and (E).<br>
The circuit board 20 (B) is desired to have the function of receiving an optical signal from an<br>
other circuit board 20. In this case, the holding member 10 comprising only the light receiving<br>
element 52 is utilized in the circuit board 20 (B).<br>
The circuit board 20 (C) is desired to have the function of sending an optical signal to an<br>
other circuit board 20. In this case, the holding member 10 comprising only the light emitting<br>
element 42 is utilized in the circuit board 20 (C).<br>
The circuit board 20 (D) is not desired to have the function of sending an optical signal to or<br>
receiving an optical signal from an other circuit board 20. In this case, the holding member 10<br>
(10B) that has neither the light receiving element 52 nor the light emitting element 42 is utilized<br>
in the circuit board 20 (D).<br>
It is possible to hold a plurality of the circuit boards 20 having various roles with a<br>
predetermined distance therebetween by utilizing a combination of the plurality of types of<br>
holding members 10. Further, the holding members 10 are capable of constructing an optical<br>
communication path between the plurality of circuit boards 20, and allowing information to be<br>
sent and received.<br>
[0044]<br>
As described above, the holding member 10 is characterized in comprising the optical<br>
waveguide 12 along which the optical signals travel. The holding member 10 has the roles both<br>
of mechanically holding the circuit boards 20 and of functioning as the optical communication<br>
path along which the optical signals travel. The holding member 10 is capable of both<br>
mechanically holding the circuit boards 20 and of providing the optical waveguide 12 along<br>
which the optical signals travel between the circuit boards 20. Since the plurality of circuit<br>
boards 20 are stacked, the optical waveguides 12 of the holding members 10 are optically<br>
connected, and consequently an optical waveguide 12 can be provided which extends across the<br>
plurality of holding members 10 even when the plurality of holding members 10 are joined<br>
together. The light receiving portion 50 and the light emitting portion 40 disposed on the holding<br>
member 10 receive and send the optical signals that travel along the optical waveguide 12. If the<br>
optical waveguide 12 receives and sends the optical signals utilizing the light receiving portion<br>
26<br><br>
50 and the light emitting portion 40, it is possible to receive and send information between the<br>
plurality of circuit boards 20. Further, when the light receiving element 52 and the light emitting<br>
element 42 are disposed integrally within the holding member 10, as in the present embodiment,<br>
it is not necessary to accurately determine the positional relationship between the light receiving<br>
element 52 and the light emitting element 42. It is consequently possible to stably receive and<br>
send the optical signals between the light receiving element 52 and the light emitting element 42<br>
when the holding members 10 have been joined together. Further, by disposing the optical<br>
waveguide 12 within the holding member 10, it is possible to maintain a stable optical<br>
communication function even if the circuit board 20 has expanded or contracted due to<br>
temperature change or the like. As a result, the holding member 10 is capable of accurately<br>
transmitting information, wherein the optical signals are the medium of information, between the<br>
plurality of circuit boards 20. It is possible to accurately transmit information between a plurality<br>
of types of circuit boards 20 by utilizing a plurality of types of holding members 10 in which the<br>
optical waveguides 12 are disposed.<br>
[0045]<br>
The holding member 10 also comprises the following characteristics:<br>
(1)	Since the optical waveguide 12 is disposed in the holding member 10, it is not necessary<br>
to separately provide a member for the optical waveguide in the circuit board 20. As a result,<br>
using the holding member 10 allows the area of the circuit board 20 to be reduced, and allows the<br>
module 100 to be miniaturized.<br>
(2)	Using the holding member 10 allows an optical waveguide 12 to be presented in which<br>
only one system penetrates a plurality of the holding members 10. As a result, using the holding<br>
member 10 allows the area of the circuit board 20 to be reduced, and allows the module 100 to be<br>
miniaturized. Further, the structure for optical communication can be simplified by having the<br>
optical waveguide 12 be only one system.<br>
(3)	The circuit board 20 is gripped between and held above and below by the holding<br>
members 10. Since the opening 22 of the circuit board 20 is formed in a substantially circular<br>
shape and the holding member 10 that is inserted into this opening 22 is formed in a substantially<br>
circular shape, it is possible to rotate the circuit board 20 around the axis of the holding member<br>
10 by adjusting the gripping force. As a result, it is possible to adjust the position of the circuit<br>
board 20 with respect to the axis of the holding member 10. The positional relationships of the<br>
circuit boards 20 in the direction of stacking can thereby be made to conform accurately with one<br>
another.<br>
[0046]<br>
27<br><br>
The following variants can also be considered.<br>
(4) FIG. 6 and FIG. 7 schematically show cross-sectional views of a variant of the holding<br>
member 10A and a variant of the holding member 10B. The optical waveguide 12 of the holding<br>
member 10A and the holding member 10B both comprise collecting lenses 91 and 92 at the first<br>
end face 12a and the second end face 12b.<br>
In the case where a plurality of the circuit boards 20 are held, an optical waveguide is<br>
constructed that extends across the plurality of holding members 10 by means of optically<br>
connecting the optical waveguide 12 of each of the holding members 10. If the collecting lens 91<br>
is disposed at the first end face 12a of the optical waveguide 12 of the holding member 10, this<br>
collecting lens 91 can prevent an optical signal radiated from the first end face 12a of the optical<br>
waveguide 12 from widening spatially even if a space is formed between the holding member 10<br>
and the other holding member 10. As a result, the collecting lens 91 can cause the optical signal<br>
to travel efficiently from the first end face 12a to the second end face 12b of the other holding<br>
member 10. Alternatively, if the collecting lens 92 is disposed at the second end face 12b of the<br>
optical waveguide 12 of the other holding member 10, this collecting lens 92 can prevent an<br>
optical signal radiated from the second end face 12b of the optical waveguide 12 from widening<br>
spatially. The optical signal can be caused to travel efficiently from the second end face 12b to<br>
the first end face 12a of the holding member 10. If the collecting lenses 91 and 92 are disposed at<br>
the first end face I2a and the second end face 12b, optical signals that are traveling in both<br>
directions along the optical waveguide 12 can be caused to travel efficiently between the first end<br>
face 12a and the second end face 12b.<br>
The collecting lenses 91 and 92 are useful in, for example, the case shown in FIG. 8.<br>
Examples are shown in FIG. 8 in which there is a difference 20W in the thickness of the circuit<br>
board 20. As shown in FIG. 8 (A), the holding member 10 fits satisfactorily with the other<br>
holding member 10 in the case where the circuit board 20 is thin, and a space is not formed<br>
between the optical waveguides 12 thereof. These optical waveguides 12 have satisfactory<br>
optical communication. However, as shown in FIG. 8 (B), a space of the insert bore 60 is formed<br>
between the holding member 10 and the other holding member 10 when a thick circuit board 20<br>
is to be held utilizing the same holding members 10. The optical waveguide 12 is not formed in<br>
the space of the insert bore 60. As a result, unless a countermeasure is devised, the optical signal<br>
radiated from the first end face 12a or the second end face 12b of the optical waveguide 12<br>
widens spatially within the space of the insert bore 60, and a part of the radiated optical signal<br>
does not reach the other end face. Consequently, unless a countermeasure is devised, there is the<br>
problem that the signal strength of the optical signal decreases. However, the collecting lenses 91<br>
28<br><br>
and 92 are disposed at the first end face 12a and the second end face 12b in the present<br>
embodiment. As a result, the collecting lenses 91 and 92 prevent the optical signal from<br>
widening spatially in the space of the insert bore 60, and the optical signal can travel efficiently<br>
from the one end face to the other end face. It is thus possible, by providing the collecting lenses<br>
91 and 92, to utilize only one type of holding member 10 to deal with a plurality of the circuit<br>
boards 20 having differing thicknesses. As a result, the number of components can be reduced<br>
when a module is to be constructed, and costs can be greatly reduced.<br>
Further, it is preferred that focal distance can be changed in the collecting lenses 91 and 92.<br>
For example, there may be a mechanism for changing focal distance by means of combining a<br>
plurality of collecting lenses. Alternatively, collecting lenses may be adopted in which the<br>
curvature of the collecting lens can be changed. When the focal distance of the collecting lenses<br>
91 and 92 can be changed, it is possible for the satisfactory travel of optical signals to be realized<br>
by changing the focal distance in accordance with the size of the space of the insert bore 60. For<br>
example, if the space of the insert bore 60 becomes too large, the optical signal radiated from the<br>
end face widens spatially before reaching the other end face, and there is thus a deterioration in<br>
the travel of the optical signal. This case can be countered by increasing the focal distance.<br>
[0047]<br>
Further, the following applications can also be considered.<br>
(5)	Since both the light emitting portion 40 and the light receiving portion 50 are provided in<br>
the holding member 10, the optical signal from the light emitting portion 40 can be monitored by<br>
the light receiving portion 50 provided in the same holding member 10. Feedback control of the<br>
light emitting portion 40 is thus possible based on the state of the light emitting portion 40 that<br>
has been monitored by the light receiving portion 50. In this case, feedback control can be made<br>
possible by providing a processing circuit of a microcomputer, etc. connected between the light<br>
emitting portion 40 and the light receiving portion 50 within the holding member 10.<br>
(6)	In the case where the light receiving portion 50 and the light emitting portion 40 are<br>
provided in the same holding member 10, the light emitting portion 40 may create an optical<br>
signal upon the cue that the light receiving portion 50 has obtained the optical signal from the<br>
other holding member 10. By joining the light receiving portion 50 and the light emitting portion<br>
40, it is possible to amplify the optical signal from the other holding member 10, and cause the<br>
optical signal to travel toward the other holding member 10. For example, in the case where a<br>
plurality of the circuit boards 20 are stacked, it is possible to compensate for energy loss of the<br>
optical signal, and to cause the optical signal to travel toward the plurality of circuit boards 20.<br>
Further, in the case where plastic fiber is utilized in the optical waveguide 12 (plastic fiber<br>
29<br><br>
usually having a greater energy loss than glass fiber), it is possible to compensate for energy loss<br>
of the optical signal, and to cause the optical signal to travel toward the plurality of circuit boards<br>
20. In this case, it is possible to adjust the timing with which the light emitting portion 40 creates<br>
the optical signals between the light receiving portion 50 and the light emitting portion 40 by<br>
providing a processing circuit of a microcomputer, etc. connected between the light emitting<br>
portion 40 and the light receiving portion 50 within the holding member 10.<br>
Further, instead of the structure in the present embodiment, the following structures can also<br>
be adopted.<br>
(7)	In the case where the light receiving portion 50 and the light emitting portion 40 are<br>
provided in the same holding member 10, the light emitting portion 40 may create an optical<br>
signal having a differing wavelength upon the cue that the light receiving portion 50 has obtained<br>
the optical signal from the other holding member 10. It is possible to add information about the<br>
state of communication by creating an optical signal that has a differing wavelength. For<br>
example, it is possible to add the information that an optical signal has been received from a<br>
predetermined circuit board 20.<br>
(8)	The optical signal may travel in only a selected direction along the optical waveguide 12.<br>
In this case, it is preferred that an optical mirror that totally reflects is utilized in the reflecting<br>
means. Further, in this case it is preferred that, when the light receiving portion 50 and the light<br>
emitting portion 40 are provided in the same holding member 10, the light emitting portion 40<br>
creates an optical signal upon the cue that the light receiving portion 50 has obtained the optical<br>
signal from the other holding member 10. Further, in this case, it is preferred that one end and an<br>
other end of the optical waveguide 12 extending across the joined holding members 10 are<br>
optically connected, with a loop-shaped optical waveguide being constructed. Information can<br>
thus be sent and received between the plurality of circuit boards 20 even though the optical signal<br>
travels only in the selected direction along the optical waveguide 12. Further, by moving the light<br>
receiving portion 50 and the light emitting portion 40, it is possible to compensate for energy loss<br>
of the optical signal, and to cause the optical signal to travel toward the plurality of circuit boards<br>
20.<br>
[0048]<br>
(Second Embodiment)<br>
FIG. 9 shows a cross-sectional view of a holding member 10C of a second embodiment.<br>
This example is equivalent to a variant of the second type of holding member 10B of the first<br>
embodiment. However, this technical concept can also be applied to the first type of holding<br>
member 10A of the first embodiment, or to another type of holding member 10. Moreover, where<br>
30<br><br>
the configuration is the same in FIG. 9 as in the holding members 10A and 10B of the first<br>
embodiment, the same numbers are applied thereto and a description thereof is omitted.<br>
The holding member 10C comprises a noise filter 62. The noise filter 62 is electrically<br>
connected with power supply wires 38a and 38b for power supply voltage, and a grounding<br>
bifurcating wire 33a that extends from the grounding wire 33 for grounding voltage. The noise<br>
filter 62 removes wavelength components of the high frequency range that constitute noise, and<br>
creates stable power supply voltage.<br>
As shown in FIG. 10, two types of circuit diagrams of the noise filter 62 are proposed in the<br>
present embodiment. FIG. 10 (a) shows a circuit diagram of a noise filter 62A in which cut off<br>
frequency is fixed. FIG. 10 (b) shows a circuit diagram of a noise filter 62B in which cut off<br>
frequency can be adjusted.<br>
As shown in FIG. 10 (a), the noise filter 62A is a low pass filter, and comprises a capacitor<br>
C, and resistors R1 and R2. Ferrite can be utilized as a resistor body in the resistors R1 and R2.<br>
One end of the capacitor C is connected with a connecting terminal 64 that is connected with the<br>
grounding bifurcating wire 33 a. The other end of the capacitor C is connected with one end of<br>
each of the resistors Rl and R2. The other end of the resistor Rl is connected with a power<br>
supply terminal 63 that is connected with the power supply wire 38b. The other end of the<br>
resistor R2 is connected with a power supply terminal 65 that is connected with the power supply<br>
wire 38a.<br>
The noise filter 62A shown in FIG. 10 (a) can remove frequency components that are higher<br>
than a cut off frequency that is determined based on the capacity of the capacitor C and the<br>
resistance of the resistors Rl and R2. High frequency range noise can thereby be removed, and<br>
stable power supply voltage can be created.<br>
In the noise filter 62B shown in FIG. 10 (b), a capacitor C in which capacity can be adjusted<br>
and resistors Rl and R2 in which resistance can be adjusted are utilized. The cut off frequency of<br>
the noise filter 62B can thus be adjusted as desired. It is possible to adjust the high frequency<br>
range of noise whose removal is desired by adjusting the cut off frequency. Moreover, it is not<br>
necessary that the capacitor C and the resistors Rl and R2 shown here all have changeable<br>
capacity or resistance respectively, and instead the cut off frequency may be adjusted by changing<br>
any one thereof.<br>
[0049]<br>

FIG. 11 schematically shows a wiping mechanism 75 disposed in the insert bore 60 of the<br>
holding member 10.<br>
31<br><br>
The wiping mechanism 75 comprises a wiper 74, an arm 73, and a holding portion 72 that<br>
holds the arm 73 at the inner surface which defines the insert bore 60. The wiper 74 comprises<br>
cylindrically shaped antistatic high density urethane and minute split fiber covering a surface<br>
thereof. The arm 73 supports the wiper 74 from the inner surface of the insert bore 60, and<br>
enables the wiper 74 to move. A plate spring is utilized in the arm 74, whereby elastic<br>
deformation is possible.<br>
FIGS. 11 (a), (b), and (c) show the operation of the wiping mechanism 75 over time when<br>
the second portion 14 of the other holding member 10 is fitted into the insert bore 60. So that the<br>
positional relationship in an axial direction of the wiping mechanism 75, the insert bore 60, the<br>
second portion 14 of the other holding member 10, and the end face of the optical waveguide 12<br>
can easily be understood, a schematic plan view is shown at the upper part of FIGS. 11 (a) , (b),<br>
and (c).<br>
As shown in FIG. 11 (a), the wiper 74 is disposed, from a plan view, at a peripheral edge<br>
part of the optical waveguide 12 of the other holding member 10 at a stage prior to the second<br>
portion 14 of the other holding member 10 being fitted into the insert bore 60.<br>
As shown in FIGS. 11 (b) and (c), when the second portion 14 of the other holding member<br>
10 is fitted into the insert bore 60, a top end face of the other holding member 10 makes contact<br>
with the wiper 74. The arm 73 receives force from the other holding member 10 being pushed in<br>
toward the upper direction of the page, and deforms elastically. The wiper 74 moves while<br>
making contact with a top end face of the optical waveguide 12 that is exposed at a top end face<br>
of the second portion 14. At this juncture, the wiper 74 moves from one peripheral edge part<br>
toward the other peripheral edge part of the optical waveguide 12, moving along the entire<br>
surface of the optical waveguide 12. Impurities adhering to the top end face of the optical<br>
waveguide 12 that is exposed at the top end face of the second portion 14 are thus removed when<br>
the second portion 14 of the other holding member 10 is fitted into the insert bore 60. As a result,<br>
it is possible to avoid noise being superimposed upon the optical signal by impurities, etc.<br>
adhering to the top end face of the optical waveguide 12 that is exposed at the top end face of the<br>
second portion 14.<br>
Further, when the second portion 14 of the other holding member 10 is fitted into the insert<br>
bore 60, the wiping mechanism 75 retreats from the interior to the exterior of the optical<br>
waveguide 12. The wiping mechanism 75 thus does not hinder the passage of the optical signal.<br>
Consequently, it is possible to avoid noise being superimposed upon the optical signal passing<br>
along the optical waveguide 12.<br>
32<br><br>
Since the holding member 10 transmits the optical signal utilizing the optical waveguide 12<br>
that penetrates the body 15 of the holding member 10, it is possible to prevent dust, etc. from<br>
entering the optical waveguide 12 from the exterior. With the holding member 10, impurities on<br>
the top end face of the optical waveguide 12 exposed at the top end face of the second portion 14<br>
can be removed by the wiping mechanism 75 when the holding members 10 are fitted together,<br>
and furthermore it is possible thereafter to prevent dust, etc. from entering the optical waveguide<br>
12. When the holding member 10 of the present embodiment is utilized, it is possible to reduce<br>
the noise superimposed upon the optical signal from impurities, dust, etc. when the holding<br>
member taught in the present specification is utilized, and accurate optical signals can be<br>
transmitted.<br>
[0050]<br>
(Fourth Embodiment)<br>
FIG. 12 schematically shows a socket 110 (an example of an engaging means) formed on the<br>
circuit board 20. FIG. 12 (A) shows a plan view of the socket 110. FIG. 12 (B) shows a cross-<br>
sectional view of the socket 110, and is a cross-sectional view corresponding to the line 12B-12B<br>
of FIG. 12 (A). FIG. 13 shows a state where the circuit board 20 and the holding member 10 are<br>
held by means of the socket 110. Further, the holding member 10 of FIG. 13 has a configuration<br>
essentially the same as that of the holding member 10 of the first embodiment and the second<br>
embodiment. Where the configuration has the same operation and effects as in the first<br>
embodiment and the second embodiment, the same numbers are applied thereto, and a<br>
description thereof is omitted.<br>
As shown in FIG. 12, the socket 110 comprises a base 111 fixed to the top of the circuit<br>
board 20. The base 111 comprises a penetrating hole 140 that corresponds to the opening 22 of<br>
the circuit board 20. The contours of the opening 22 of the circuit board 20 conform to the<br>
contours of the penetrating hole 140 of the base 111, and the second portion 14 of the holding<br>
member 10 can be inserted therein. The socket 110 further comprises a guide member 120 that<br>
extends in a vertical direction from the base 111. The guide member 120 comprises a lower<br>
guide member 124 and two upper guide members 122 that extend in a vertical direction from a<br>
part of the lower guide member 124. The lower guide member 124 forms a loop around the<br>
periphery of the penetrating hole 140 of the base 111. The two upper guide members 122 are<br>
disposed in symmetrical positions facing the penetrating hole 140 of the base 111. The inner<br>
diameter of the lower guide member 124 is formed so as to substantially conform to the outer<br>
diameter of the first portion 16 of the holding member 10. Consequently, as shown in FIG. 13,<br>
the first portion 16 of the holding member 10 is held in a state where it makes contact with an<br>
33<br><br>
inner surface of the lower guide member 124. An engagement part 130 is formed at an anterior<br>
end of the upper guide members 122. The engagement parts 130 engage with an engagement part<br>
19 formed on the holding member 10.<br>
[0051]<br>
The socket 110 comprises a plurality of connecting terminals 182 and 188 that are formed so<br>
as to pass through the base 111. Plate shaped metal terminals, spring type metal terminals, etc.<br>
are utilized in the connecting terminals 182 and 188. The connecting terminals 182 and 188 of<br>
the present embodiment are the grounding connecting terminal 182 and the power supply<br>
connecting terminal 188. As shown in FIG. 13, the grounding connecting terminal 182 is<br>
electrically connected with the grounding third terminal 82 and the circuit on the circuit board<br>
20. The power supply connecting terminal 188 is electrically connected with the power supply<br>
third terminal and the circuit on the circuit board 20. Moreover, in the case where the light<br>
emitting portion 40 or the light receiving portion 50 is disposed in the holding member 10, other<br>
connecting terminals are utilized to electrically connect the light emitting element signal terminal<br>
84 or the light receiving element signal terminal 86 with the circuit on the circuit board 20.<br>
[0052]<br>
The socket 110 and the circuit board 20 are fixed together by soldering or the like. If the<br>
socket 110 is fixed in advance on the circuit board 20, the holding member 10 can be fixed onto<br>
the circuit board 20 by the engagement parts 130 of the socket 110 engaging with the<br>
engagement part 19 of the holding member 10. If the socket 110 is utilized, it is for example not<br>
necessary to fix the holding member 10 to the circuit board 20 by means of soldering or the like.<br>
As a result, the thermal load of soldering, etc. is not applied to the optical waveguide 12 of the<br>
holding member 10. In particular, in the case where the light emitting element 42 or the light<br>
receiving element 52 are disposed in the holding member 10, the light emitting element 42 or the<br>
light receiving element 52 may not function properly due to thermal load. If the socket 110 is<br>
utilized, the optical waveguide 12, the light emitting element 42, and the light receiving element<br>
52 of the holding member 10 are maintained in a satisfactory state. It is thus possible to provide<br>
stable optical communication by utilizing the socket 110.<br>
[0053]<br>
(Fifth Embodiment)<br>
FIG. 14 and FIG. 15 schematically show cross-sectional views of essential components of a<br>
holding member 200. FIG. 14 shows a stage in which the second portion 14 of an other holding<br>
member 200 is being inserted into an insert bore 60 of the holding member 200. FIG. 15 shows a<br>
stage in which the second portion 14 of the other holding member 200 has been inserted to a<br>
34<br><br>
predetermined position in the insert bore 60 of the holding member 200. Moreover, where the<br>
configuration has the same operation and effects as in the other embodiments, the same numbers<br>
are applied thereto, and a description thereof is omitted.<br>
The body 15 of the holding member 200 comprises a detecting means 260 and a holding<br>
means 266. When the second portion 14 of the other holding member 200 has been inserted into<br>
the insert bore 60 of the holding member 200, the detecting means 260 detects that the second<br>
portion 14 has been inserted to the predetermined position in the insert bore 60. The holding<br>
means 266 holds the holding member 200 and the other holding member 200 at that<br>
predetermined position. Various means can be adopted in the detecting means 260. The present<br>
embodiment is an example in which it is detected that the holding member 200 and the other<br>
holding member 200 are disposed in the predetermined position by engaging the holding member<br>
200 and the other holding member 200 by means of a special mechanism. Instead of this<br>
example, various assemblies can be adopted in the detecting means utilizing physical force such<br>
as magnetism, etc., or utilizing the pressing force of a spring, etc.<br>
In FIG. 14 and FIG. 15, only a part of the holding member 200 and a part of the other<br>
holding member 200 are shown. For this reason, the compositional elements of the detecting<br>
means 260 are shown divided across the holding member 200 and the other holding member 200.<br>
However, when the part of the holding member 200 and a part of the other holding member 200<br>
are joined together, this can be considered to form one holding member 200. This one holding<br>
member 200 is actually provided with a part of the compositional elements of the holding<br>
member 200 and a part of the compositional elements of the other holding member 200 that are<br>
shown in FIG. 14 and FIG. 15. Consequently, the one holding member 200 is provided with all<br>
of the compositional elements of the detecting means 260. Similarly, the one holding member<br>
200 is provided with all of the compositional elements of the holding means 266. The<br>
compositional elements of both these means will be described below based on the<br>
aforementioned concept.<br>
[0054]<br>
The detecting means 260 is formed in at least a part of the first portion 16 of the body 15,<br>
and comprises a first penetrating hole 263 that extends from an outer surface of the first portion<br>
16 to the insert bore 60. The detecting means 260 comprises a first projection 261 formed upon<br>
at least a portion of the outer surface of the second portion 14. The detecting means 260 further<br>
comprises a first engagement member 264 disposed within the first penetrating hole 263, one<br>
side end 262 of the first engagement member 264 being exposed at the outer surface of the first<br>
portion 16, and an other side end 265 of the first engagement member 264 protruding into the<br>
35<br><br>
insert bore 60. A supporting rod 264a is disposed at approximately the central portion of the first<br>
engagement member 264. The supporting rod 264a extends through the first engagement member<br>
264, and both ends thereof are fixed to an inner surface that defines the first penetrating hole 263.<br>
The supporting rod 264a supports the first engagement member 264 in a manner allowing<br>
rotation.<br>
[0055]<br>
The holding means 266 comprises a second penetrating hole 268 formed in at least a portion<br>
of the first portion 16 of the body 15, and extending from the outer surface of the first portion 16<br>
to the insert bore 60. The second penetrating hole 268 receives a second engagement member<br>
269. The second engagement member 269 is not a part of the elements forming the body 15. The<br>
holding means 266 comprises a second projection 267 formed upon at least an other portion of<br>
the outer surface of the second portion 14. When the first engagement member 264 and the first<br>
projection 261 of the detecting means 260 are in an engaged state, the second projection 267 of<br>
the holding means 266 engages with the second engagement member 269 that has passed through<br>
the second penetrating hole 268.<br>
Moreover, components with various features may be adopted in the holding means 266. For<br>
example, as shown in FIG. 16 (A), the holding member 200 may be held utilizing a plurality of<br>
the second engagement members 269. Alternatively, as shown in FIG. 16 (B), the holding<br>
member 200 may be held utilizing a second engagement member 269 that has two arms.<br>
[0056]<br>
In order for optical communication to be performed stably between the optical waveguide 12<br>
of the holding member 200 and the optical waveguide 12 of the other holding member 200, it is<br>
desirable to have a satisfactory optical connection between the end face of the optical waveguide<br>
12 of the holding member 200 and the end face of the optical waveguide 12 of the other holding<br>
member 200. In order to realize a satisfactory optical connection, it is desirable to dispose the<br>
holding member 200 and the other holding member 200 with a predetermined positional<br>
relationship.<br>
As shown in FIG. 14, when the second portion 14 of the other holding member 200 is<br>
inserted into the insert bore 60 of the holding member 200, the other side end 265 of the first<br>
engagement member 264 protruding into the insert bore 60 slides along a tapered face 14a of the<br>
second portion 14 that is being inserted. Since the first engagement member 264 is fixed to the<br>
holding member 200 by means of the supporting rod 264a, the movement of the first engagement<br>
member 264 in the axial direction of the first penetrating hole 263 is regulated. As a result, a part<br>
of the first engagement member 264 that is further to the insert bore 60 side than the supporting<br>
36<br><br>
rod 264a receives compressive stress and deforms elastically. The insert bore 60 of the holding<br>
member 200 thus receives the second portion 14 of the other holding member 200. Further, the<br>
first engagement member 264 rotates around the supporting rod 264a, and the side end 262 of the<br>
first engagement member 264 moves upward. Further, as shown in FIG. 15, the other side end<br>
265 of the first engagement member 264 engages with the first projection 261 when the second<br>
portion 14 of the other holding member 200 is inserted to a deep position in the insert bore 60 of<br>
the holding member 200. When the other side end 265 of the first engagement member 264<br>
engages with the first projection 261, the side end 262 of the first engagement member 264<br>
returns to its initial position. The user can thus visually ascertain that the second portion 14 of the<br>
other holding member 200 has been inserted to the predetermined position in the insert bore 60<br>
of the holding member 200. Further, when the first engagement member 264 and the first<br>
projection 261 are engaged, the holding member 200 and the other holding member 200 are<br>
joined together. Although this state is a semi stopped state, the detecting means 260 provides a<br>
resistance force to prevent the other holding member 200 from coming out of the holding<br>
member 200. As a result, the user can ascertain by means of this resistance force that the second<br>
portion 14 of the other holding member 200 has been inserted to the predetermined position in<br>
the insert bore 60 of the holding member 200.<br>
[0057]<br>
When the holding member 200 and the other holding member 200 are disposed with the<br>
predetermined positional relationship, the second projection 267 of the holding means 266 can<br>
engage with the second engagement member 269 that has passed through the second penetrating<br>
hole 268. The second projection 267 of the holding means 266 cannot engage with the second<br>
engagement member 269 until the holding member 200 and the other holding member 200 have<br>
been disposed with the predetermined positional relationship. The second projection 267 of the<br>
holding means 266 can engage with the second engagement member 269 that has passed through<br>
the second penetrating hole 268 when the first engagement member 264 and the first projection<br>
261 of the detecting means 260 are in an engaged state. The holding means 266 can firmly<br>
maintain the holding member 200 and the other holding member 200 in a state where they are<br>
disposed in the predetermined positional relationship. As a result, stable optical communication<br>
can be performed between the optical waveguide 12 of the holding member 200 and the optical<br>
waveguide 12 of the other holding member 200. In particular, the second engagement member<br>
269 shown in FIG. 16 (B) has a tapered face 269a, and the optical waveguide 12 of the holding<br>
member 200 and the optical waveguide 12 of the other holding member 200 can be fitted tightly<br>
together utilizing this tapered face 269a. Since the distance between the optical waveguide 12 of<br>
37<br><br>
the holding member 200 and the optical waveguide 12 of the other holding member 200 can<br>
consequently be made shorter, the optical signals are prevented from widening, spatially, and<br>
more stable optical communication can be provided.<br>
Further, the user can ascertain from the second engagement member 269 having passed<br>
through the second penetrating hole 268 that the other side end 265 of the first engagement<br>
member 264 is engaged with the first projection 261.<br>
[0058]<br>
Moreover, when the side end 262 of the first engagement member 264 is moved upward, the<br>
other side end 265 thereof moves downward, allowing the other side end 265 of the first<br>
engagement member 264 to disengage from the first projection 261. If the holding members 200<br>
are attached in the wrong sequence when a plurality of the holding members 200 are to be joined,<br>
it is thereby possible to disengage the holding members 200 and rejoin them correctly.<br>
[0059]<br>
(Sixth Embodiment)<br>
FIG. 17 schematically shows a cross-sectional view of a holding member 300. Moreover,<br>
where the compositional elements and the operation and effects are the same as in the other<br>
embodiments, the same numbers are applied thereto, and a description thereof is omitted.<br>
The body 15 of the holding member 300 comprises a divided portion 301 divided from a<br>
remaining portion 302 along the penetrating direction (the up-down direction of the page) of the<br>
optical waveguide 12, and an attaching means 324 that attaches the divided portion 301 to the<br>
remaining portion 302 while being capable of varying a distance 321D therebetween. The<br>
divided portion 301 is formed in a cap shape. The divided portion 301 comprises the second<br>
portion 14 of the body 15, a plate 320 that widens in a horizontal direction from a bottom face of<br>
the second portion 14, and a peripheral edge plate 322 that extends vertically downward along a<br>
peripheral edge of the plate 320. The peripheral edge plate 322 has a cylindrical shape. A female<br>
screw 322a (an example of a first screw head) is screwed into an inner surface of the peripheral<br>
edge plate 322. A screw portion 323 is formed on a part of the first portion 16 of the body 15 that<br>
corresponds to the peripheral edge plate 322, this screw portion 323 having a diameter smaller<br>
than the diameter of the body 15. The screw portion 323 can be thought of as a protrusion portion<br>
formed on a top face of the remaining portion 302. A male screw 323a (an example of a second<br>
screw head) that corresponds to the female screw 322a of the peripheral edge plate 322 is<br>
screwed into an outer surface of the screw portion 323. The attaching means 324 consists of the<br>
peripheral edge plate 322, the female screw 322a formed on the peripheral edge plate 322, the<br>
screw portion 323, and the male screw 323a formed on the screw portion 323. By adjusting the<br>
38<br><br>
amount to which the attaching means 324 is screwed together, the attaching means 324 can<br>
adjust the distance 321D between the divided portion 301 and the remaining portion 302. Since<br>
the attaching means 324 is formed on the first portion 16 of the body 15, the length of the first<br>
portion 16 can be adjusted by means of the attaching means 324.<br>
[0060]<br>
The divided portion 301 further comprises a cylindrical electrode 332 that extends vertically<br>
downward from a bottom face of the plate 320. The cylindrical electrode 332 forms a loop<br>
around the periphery of the optical waveguide 12. The power supply wire 38 extending from the<br>
power supply second terminal 31 is disposed on a part of the cylindrical electrode 332. The<br>
power supply wire 38 is electrically connected with a cylindrical electrode power supply<br>
connector 335 formed on a part of an outer surface of the cylindrical electrode 332. Further, the<br>
grounding wire 33 extending from the grounding second terminal 32 is disposed on an other part<br>
of the cylindrical electrode 332. The grounding wire 33 is electrically connected with a<br>
cylindrical electrode grounding connector 334 formed on a part of the outer surface of the<br>
cylindrical electrode 332. The cylindrical electrode power supply connector 335 and the<br>
cylindrical electrode grounding connector 334 are separated along the circumference direction of<br>
the cylindrical electrode 332. Alternatively, the cylindrical electrode power supply connector 335<br>
and the cylindrical electrode grounding connector 334 may be separated along the axial direction<br>
of the cylindrical electrode 332.<br>
A groove for receiving the cylindrical electrode 332 is formed in an upper portion of the<br>
screw portion 323. This groove forms a loop around the periphery of the optical waveguide 12 at<br>
the upper portion of the screw portion 323. A screw portion power supply connector 336 is<br>
disposed on a part of an inner surface that defines the groove. The screw portion power supply<br>
connector 336 utilizes a spring type metal terminal. The screw portion power supply connector<br>
336 is electrically connected with the power supply wire 38 extending from the power supply<br>
first terminal 36. The screw portion power supply connector 336 and the cylindrical electrode<br>
power supply connector 335 are electrically connected. The power supply first terminal 36 and<br>
the power supply second terminal 31 are thus electrically connected via the power supply wire<br>
38, the screw portion power supply connector 336, and the cylindrical electrode power supply<br>
connector 335. Further, a screw portion grounding connector 333 is disposed on an other part of<br>
the inner surface that defines the groove. The screw portion grounding connector 333 is<br>
electrically connected with the grounding wire 33 extending from the grounding first terminal 35.<br>
The screw portion grounding connector 333 and the cylindrical electrode grounding connector<br>
334 are electrically connected. The grounding first terminal 35 and the grounding second<br>
39<br><br>
terminal 32 are thus electrically connected via the grounding wire 33, the screw portion<br>
grounding connector 333, and the cylindrical electrode grounding connector 334.<br>
[0061]<br>
The optical waveguide 12 comprises a third end face 12c exposed within a space 321<br>
between the divided portion 301 and the remaining portion 302, and formed at the optical<br>
waveguide 12 of the divided portion 301. The optical waveguide 12 comprises a fourth end face<br>
12d exposed within the space 321 between the divided portion 301 and the remaining portion<br>
302, and formed at the optical waveguide 12 of the remaining portion 302. The optical<br>
waveguide 12 further comprises collecting lenses 393 and 394 disposed at the third end face 12c<br>
and the fourth end face 12d.<br>
[0062]<br>
Next, characteristics of the holding member 300 will be described with reference to FIG. 18.<br>
There is often a variation in the distance required between the circuit boards 20 according to<br>
the type of circuit board 20 and the purpose thereof. For example, a difference 20D is required in<br>
the distance required between the circuit boards 20 in the case in FIG. 18 (A) and the distance<br>
required between the circuit boards 20 in the case in FIG. 18 (B).<br>
The holding member 300 can adjust the distance 321D between the divided portion 301 and<br>
the remaining portion 302 utilizing the attaching means 324. The attaching means 324 can adjust<br>
the length of the first portion 16. The holding member 300 can thus be made to correspond to the<br>
requirement for differing distances between the circuit boards 20 as in the cases of FIG. 18 (A)<br>
and FIG. 18 (B).<br>
[0063]<br>
The holding member 300 further consists of a countermeasure within the space 321 between<br>
the divided portion 301 and the remaining portion 302 devised to prevent optical communication<br>
from becoming unstable due to the optical signal spreading spatially. As shown in FIG. 17, the<br>
collecting lenses 393 and 394 are disposed at the third end face 12c and the fourth end face 12d.<br>
The collecting lens 393 prevents the optical signal from spreading spatially within the space 321<br>
even though this space 321 is formed between the divided portion 301 and the remaining portion<br>
302, and the optical signal can consequently travel efficiently from the third end face 12c to the<br>
fourth end face 12d. Further, the collecting lens 394 prevents the optical signal from spreading<br>
spatially within the space 321, and the optical signal can consequently travel efficiently from the<br>
fourth end face 12d to the third end face 12c.<br>
Further, it is preferred that the focal distance of the collecting lenses 393 and 394 can be<br>
changed.<br>
40<br><br>
[0064]<br>
Further, the following variant can also be considered.<br>
FIG. 19 schematically shows a cross-sectional view of a variant of the holding member 300.<br>
The optical waveguide 12 of the holding member 300 comprises collecting lenses 391 and 392<br>
disposed at the first end face 12a and the second end face 12b.<br>
The collecting lenses 391 and 392 are useful in, for example, cases such as that shown in<br>
FIG. 20. FIG. 20 shows an example of a case where there is a difference 20W in the thickness of<br>
the circuit boards 20. As shown in FIG. 20 (A), the holding member 300 fits satisfactorily with<br>
the other holding member 300 in the case where the circuit board 20 is thin, and there is<br>
satisfactory optical connection of the optical waveguides 12 thereof. When the same holding<br>
members 300 are utilized to hold the thick circuit boards 20, as shown in FIG. 20 (B), a space is<br>
formed in the insert bore 60 between the holding member 300 and the other holding member<br>
300. The optical waveguide 12 is not formed in the space in the insert bore 60. However, when<br>
the collecting lenses 391 and 392 are disposed at the first end face 12a and the second end face<br>
12b, the collecting lenses 391 and 392 are able to prevent the optical signal from widening<br>
spatially within the space in the insert bore 60. The collecting lenses 391 and 392 are thus able to<br>
cause the optical signal to travel efficiently from one end face to the other end face. It is thus<br>
possible, by providing the collecting lenses 391 and 392, to utilize only one type of holding<br>
member 300 to correspond to a plurality of the circuit boards 20 having differing thicknesses. As<br>
a result, the number of components can be reduced when a module is to be constructed, and costs<br>
can be greatly reduced.<br>
Further, it is preferred that the focal distance of the collecting lenses 391 and 392 can be<br>
changed.<br>
