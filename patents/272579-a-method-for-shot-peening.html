DESCRIPTION<br>
A Method For Shot Peening<br>
Technical Field<br>
[0001]<br>
This invention relates to a method for shot peening, and more particularly to a<br>
method for shot peening by which higher compressive residual stress can be generated<br>
in a surface layer of a processed material than by conventional methods.<br>
Background Art<br>
[0002]<br>
Conventionally, shot peening has been known as a useful method to enhance<br>
the fatigue strength of a high-strength steel such as a carburized steel, which is used for<br>
gears for automobiles, etc. A compressive residual stress in the surface layer that is<br>
generated by shot peening is known to significantly affect the bending fatigue strength<br>
at the root of a tooth.<br>
[0003]<br>
It is also well known that the compressive residual stress is affected by the<br>
sizes, hardnesses, shooting speeds, shooting times, etc. of the shot materials. Many<br>
studies have been made about the effects of the shot-peening conditions on the<br>
compressive residual stress.<br>
[0004]<br>
Recently, needs for higher-strength steels have increased as components are<br>
made smaller. Accordingly generating a higher compressive residual stress in a<br>
processed material by shot peening is required to achieve a higher fatigue strength.<br>
[0005]<br>
For example, to achieve a higher fatigue strength by 20%, a compressive<br>
residual stress at 1800 MPa in a processed material is required when the peak<br>
compressive residual stress that is generated by current heavy shot peening is 1500<br>
MPa.<br>
[0006]<br>
Previously, developing harder shot materials has been the main way to achieve<br>
the higher compressive residual stress in the processed material. However, shot<br>
 <br>
peening harder shot materials does not always cause the processed material to generate<br>
a higher compressive residual stress. In fact, it may adversely decrease the<br>
compressive residual stress. The hardness of the shot materials must be appropriate<br>
for the processed material.<br>
[0007]<br>
For example, in some combinations of shot materials having a certain hardness<br>
and a processed material having a certain hardness, the processed material may be<br>
significantly scraped by the shot materials. In this case, the energy for shooting is<br>
wasted in scraping. Thus no compressive residual stress is effectively generated in the<br>
processed material.<br>
If the shot materials have a much higher hardness than the processed material, a<br>
high compressive residual stress is generated, but much of the processed material is<br>
scraped. Thus the roughness of the surface of the processed material becomes coarse.<br>
That may create a point for initiating a fatigue fracture. Further, a large amount to be<br>
scraped may result in decreasing the size of a component.<br>
[0008]<br>
Shot materials that have a significantly higher hardness are expensive. Even<br>
if shot materials that are expensive are used, the compressive residual stress that is<br>
generated in the processed material would not increase over a certain value. Thus,<br>
only the cost would increase.<br>
Therefore it is important to balance the hardness of the shot materials with that<br>
of the processed material to properly generate a higher compressive residual stress in<br>
the surface layer of the processed material.<br>
[0009]<br>
Until now no finding has been disclosed for such ways of thinking. For<br>
example, techniques to generate a compressive residual stress in a processed material by<br>
shooting the shot materials against the processed material were disclosed in Japanese<br>
Patent Laid-open Publication No. 2002-36115, Japanese Patent Laid-open Publication<br>
No. 2001-79766, and Japanese Patent Laid-open Publication No. H9-57629.<br>
However, Japanese Patent Laid-open Publication No. 2002-36115 does not<br>
discuss scraping. Japanese Patent Laid-open Publication No. 2001-79766 does not<br>
discuss any relationship between a processed material and shot materials, nor does<br>
Japanese Patent Laid-open Publication No. H9-57629.<br>
Disclosure of Invention<br>
 <br>
[0010]<br>
Based on the background as discussed above, the object of the present<br>
invention is to provide a method for shot peening by which a higher compressive<br>
residual stress is generated in the processed steel while scraping is prevented. Thus the<br>
fatigue strength is effectively enhanced by the higher compressive residual stress.<br>
[0011]<br>
The first aspect of the present invention is characterized in that, when a<br>
hardness HV(m) of a processed steel that is calculated from equations (1) to (3) below is<br>
750HV or more, shot materials having a Vickers hardness that is higher than the<br>
hardness of the processed steel by 50HV to 250HV are shot against the processed steel.<br>
During the process the thickness of the scraped processed steel is 5 urn or less.<br>
 <br>
where C denotes the C (carbon) content in a surface layer that is achieved by<br>
carburizing (mass %), T the tempering temperature (K), t the holding time for tempering<br>
(hr), and YR the amount of residual austenite (vol. %). The value HV(m) is calculated<br>
from equation (1). It represents an estimation of the Vickers hardness. It is<br>
equivalent to the value of the Vickers hardness. Thus the letters HV arc added to the<br>
value.<br>
[0012]<br>
The second aspect of the present invention is characterized in that, in the first<br>
aspect, the C content of the surface layer is within the range of 0.60 to 1.0%.<br>
[0013]<br>
The third aspect of the present invention is characterized in that, in the first or<br>
second aspect, the sizes of the shot materials are within the range of 0.05 to 0.6 mm in<br>
diameter and the shot materials are shot against the processed steel by air at a pressure<br>
of 0.4 to 0.6 MPa.<br>
The sizes of the shot materials are typically measured by the method for<br>
measuring grain sizes as stipulated in the Japanese Industrial Standards by JIS G5904.<br>
[0014]<br>
As discussed above, the present invention is to generate a compressive residual<br>
 <br>
stress in a surface layer of a processed steel by making the hardness HV(m) of the<br>
processed steel 750HV or more. This hardness is calculated from equations (1) to (3).<br>
The compressive stress is generated by shooting shot materials having a Vickers<br>
hardness that is higher than the hardness of the processed steel by 50HV to 250HV<br>
while the thickness of the scraped processed steel is 5 p.m or less. By the present<br>
invention, a compressive residual stress such as 1800 MPa or more, which is higher<br>
than that in conventional steel, can be generated in the processed steel. Thus the<br>
fatigue strength of a high-strength component, such as a gear of an automobile, can be<br>
effectively increased.<br>
[0015]<br>
If the hardness HV(m) of the processed steel is less than 750HV, sufficient<br>
compressive residual stress is not generated in the surface layer of the processed steel by<br>
shot peening.<br>
The maximum limit to generate a compressive residual stress is almost equal to<br>
the yield strength (approximately 0.2% proof stress) of the processed steel. The yield<br>
strength is proportional to the hardness of the steel.<br>
Thus if the hardness HV(m) of the steel is less than 750HV, the maximum limit<br>
of the compressive residual stress is lowered. Thus a sufficiently higher compressive<br>
residual stress cannot be generated.<br>
Therefore, the hardness HV(m) of the processed steel must be 750HV or more.<br>
[0016]<br>
It is important that the Vickers hardness HV of the shot materials be higher<br>
than the hardness HV(m) of the processed steel.<br>
If the Vickers hardness HV of the shot materials is lower than the hardness<br>
HV(m) of the processed steel, the shot materials undergo plastic deformation (yield).<br>
Thus sufficient energy to generate a compressive residual stress cannot be transferred to<br>
the processed steel. Further, the life of the shot materials is shortened.<br>
Especially to be noted, it was found that the Vickers hardness of the shot<br>
materials must be higher than the hardness HV(m) of the processed steel by 50HV or<br>
more to generate a higher compressive residual stress in the processed steel.<br>
[0017]<br>
In contrast, if the Vickers hardness of the shot materials is higher than the<br>
hardness HV(m) of the processed steel by 250HV or more, the energy of the shot<br>
materials used to scrape the processed steel is wasted. Thus no higher compressive<br>
residual stress is effectively or stably generated.<br>
Even if a higher compressive residual stress is generated in the processed steel,<br>
 <br>
a large amount is scraped from its surface layer due to the excessively high hardness of<br>
the shot materials. Thus the size of the high-strength component may deviate from the<br>
specification. Further, the large amount to be scraped causes the surface roughness to<br>
be coarse. That may create a point for initiating a fatigue fracture.<br>
[0018]<br>
Even if a higher compressive residual stress is generated, it cannot increase<br>
over a certain value. That is, it does not increase as the hardness of the shot materials<br>
increases. But, instead, it gradually reaches a certain value.<br>
[0019]<br>
Further, the shot materials that have a much higher hardness are expensive.<br>
Thus the cost for the treatment becomes higher.<br>
For this reason, it is important that the difference between the hardness HV(m)<br>
of the processed steel and the Vickers hardness HV of the shot materials be limited to<br>
250 HV or less.<br>
[0020]<br>
In the present invention the thickness to be scraped from the processed material<br>
is limited to 5 urn. If the thickness exceeds that limit, the energy of the shot materials<br>
is wasted for scraping. Thus it is not effectively used to generate the compressive<br>
residual stress. Further, a large thickness to be scraped causes the size of the<br>
high-strength component to decrease, to thereby lower its quality.<br>
[0021]<br>
The hardness HV(m) of the processed steel as in the specification is the<br>
hardness of the surface layer of the steel after carburizing and at a depth of 0.050 mm or<br>
less from the surface. That is, the hardness HV(m) of the processed steel, which is<br>
calculated from equations (1) to (3), represents the hardness of the surface layer where<br>
the depth is 0.050 mm or less.<br>
[0022]<br>
In the present invention the hardness HV(m) of the processed steel is calculated<br>
by equations (1) to (3). By doing so the hardness HV(m) of 750 HV can be<br>
maintained by controlling the conditions of carburizing, etc. The hardness is estimated<br>
from a non-destructive test and corresponds to the Vickers hardness.<br>
The first portion of equation (1), {f(C)-f(T, t)}(1-γR /100), represents<br>
contribution of tempered martensite to the hardness. The second portion of equation<br>
(1), 400xγR /100, represents the contribution of residual austenite to the hardness.<br>
[0023]<br>
The martensitic transformation of the processed steel cannot be completed by<br>
 <br>
cooling the material to room temperature. Thus it has a structure that is a combination<br>
of a quenched structure (martensite) and residual austenite that has not been<br>
transformed.<br>
Therefore the estimate of the hardness HV(m) of the processed steel must be<br>
based on these two structures. The part {f(C)-f(T, t)} of the first portion of equation<br>
(1) represents the hardness of the martensite after tempering. The term f(C) denotes<br>
the hardness of the martensite before tempering. The term f(T, t) denotes the reduction<br>
of the hardness by tempering. The part (1-ΓR /100) represents the ratio of the volume<br>
of the martensite.<br>
[0024]<br>
The term f(C) is expressed as equation (2), i.e., f(C) = -660C2+ 1373C + 278.<br>
This equation is obtained by approximating by a quadratic curve the relationship<br>
between the carbon content of the martensite and its hardness. To obtain the equation<br>
various kinds of martensite that have different carbon contents are used.<br>
[0025]<br>
Quenching conditions are determined by the tempering temperature and<br>
tempering time. Thus the reduction of hardness f(T, t) by tempering is expressed by an<br>
approximation (by Hollomon, et al.), 0.05T(logt+17)-318, which uses the tempering<br>
temperature T and the tempering time t.<br>
The value 400 of the second portion of equation 1 denotes the hardness<br>
(Vickers hardness) of the residual austenite.<br>
[0026]<br>
In the second aspect of the present invention, the C content of the surface layer<br>
is kept within the range of 0.60% to 1.0%. Thereby the conditions of the first aspect<br>
are maintained.<br>
[0027]<br>
If the C content is less than 0.60%, the hardness of the processed steel is lower<br>
due to the low C content. Thus it may be difficult to maintain the hardness to comply<br>
with the conditions of the first aspect.<br>
[0028]<br>
In contrast, if the C content exceeds 1.0%, there will be too much residual<br>
austenite. That results in the decrease of the hardness of the processed steel. Thus it<br>
may be difficult to maintain the hardness to comply with the conditions of the first<br>
aspect. Further, if the C content is excessive, much carbide is deposited at the grain<br>
boundaries. That may cause a deterioration of the fatigue strength.<br>
[0029]<br>
 <br>
The C content is preferably kept in the range of 0.60% to 0.85%. If it exceeds<br>
0.85%, the hardness of the processed steel starts to decrease because of too much<br>
residual austenite. However, when the steel is subject to a subzero treatment, i.e.,<br>
where it is cooled to a temperature (e.g., -80 °C) much lower than room temperature, the<br>
residual austenite is transformed to the martensite. Thus the ratio of the volume of the<br>
residual austenite, which is 10 to 40 vol. %, is reduced to 5 to 15 vol. %. As a result<br>
the hardness of the processed steel can be improved.<br>
[0030]<br>
Carburizing is preferably carried out as vacuum eutectoid carburizing.<br>
In gas carburizing, an abnormally carburized layer, which is a soft layer caused<br>
by the oxidization of the surface (deteriorated ability to quench due to oxidization at the<br>
grain boundaries), may be created to lower the hardness of the processed steel. Thus it<br>
is difficult to maintain the hardness of the processed steel to comply with the conditions<br>
of the first aspect. However, even for gas carburizing, it is possible to have the<br>
hardness of the processed steel comply with the conditions, either by using a material<br>
that has a good ability to quench or by removing the abnormally carburized layer after<br>
quenching (before shot peening).<br>
[0031]<br>
In the third aspect of the present invention, shot materials that are 0.05 to 0.6<br>
mm in diameter are used. They are shot against the processed steel by air at a pressure<br>
of 0.4 to 0.6 MPa.<br>
[0032]<br>
If the shot materials are less than 0.05 mm in diameter, it is difficult to<br>
manufacture them. If they are greater than 0.6 mm, the peak of the compressive<br>
residual stress occurs at a deeper point. Thus the distribution of the compressive<br>
residual stress is not effective to enhance the fatigue strength. The peak preferably<br>
occurs at 100 urn or less from the surface, so as to enhance the fatigue strength.<br>
[0033]<br>
If the air pressure is less than 0.4 MPa, the intensity of the shot peening<br>
decreases. Thus it may be difficult to generate a high compressive residual stress such<br>
as 1800 MPa or more.<br>
In contrast, if it is greater than 0.6 MPa, the intensity may be excessive. Thus<br>
much of the processed steel may be scraped. Further, it is difficult to compress air at<br>
the pressure of 0.6 MPa or more by the ordinary shot-peening machine.<br>

Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
[0035]<br>
Below an embodiment of the present invention is discussed in detail.<br>
Steel having the chemical composition as listed in Table 1 is used to prepare a<br>
processed material. The steel is SCM420H (chromium-molybdenum steel), as<br>
specified by JIS G 4502. The middle line of Table 1 shows the range of the chemical<br>
composition for SCM420H. The bottom line shows the chemical composition of the<br>
material that is used for the processed material. The raw material of the steel is<br>
machined into a steel bar that is 25 mm in diameter x 100 mm long. The bar is<br>
carburized and processed by shot peening under the conditions listed in Tables 2 and 3.<br>
Then, the thicknesses of scraped processed materials and the peak values of<br>
compressive residual stresses are measured. The process for shot peening is discussed<br>
below.<br>
[0036]<br>
 <br>
 <br>
<br>
[0037]<br>
<method for shot peening><br>
As shown in Fig. 1, an air-type shot-peening machine, which has an injection<br>
nozzle 10, is used to process a material 12 by shot peening.<br>
The material 12 to be processed is located at 200 mm from the injection nozzle<br>
10. It is placed so that its surface to be processed is perpendicular to the angle for<br>
shooting the shot materials.<br>
While the material 12 is rotated on a turntable at 30 rpm (one rotation per two<br>
seconds), its surface is processed by shot peening.<br>
The time for shot peening is set so that the coverage of the surface by the shot<br>
peening is 300%. The shot materials have diameters of 0.05 to 0.6 mm and a Vickers<br>
hardnesses of 700HV to 1380HV. The air pressure for the shot peening is within the<br>
range of 0.3 to 0.6 MPa.<br>
The number "14" in Fig. 1 denotes a masking material.<br>
[0038]<br>
Using the processed materials that are prepared as above, the thicknesses of<br>
scraped materials and the peak values of the residual compressive stresses are measured<br>
as below.<br>
<method for measuring thickness of scraped material><br>
The diameters of the processed materials 12 both before shot peening and after<br>
shot peening are measured by using a laser-type dimension-measuring device. The<br>
thickness of the scraped material is calculated by the following equation. The<br>
thickness is the mean value often measurements (n = 10). The positions used for the<br>
measurements are the centers of areas against which the shot materials are shot (the<br>
positions where the maximum thicknesses of scraped materials occur).<br>
The thickness of scraped material = (D1 - D2)/2,<br>
where D1 denotes the diameter of the processed material before shot peening,<br>
and D2 denotes the diameter of the processed material after shot peening.<br>
[0039]<br>
<method for measuring compressive residual stress><br>
An X-ray stress measuring method, which is a common method for a<br>
non-destructive test, and specified by JIS B 2711, is used to measure the compressive<br>
residual stresses of the processed materials after shot peening.<br>
Since the samples have martensitic structures, the residual stresses are<br>
measured by using CrKa radiation as X-rays and -318 MPa/0 as the stress constant k.<br>
 <br>
The positions for the measurements are the centers of the areas against which the shot<br>
materials are shot.<br>
The peak (maximum value) of the compressive residual stress is measured by<br>
electropolishing the processed material to a determined thickness in an area that is<br>
approximately double the sectional area of an incident x-ray beam and by measuring the<br>
stress distribution.<br>
[0040]<br>
The carbon content and the percentages of residual austenite at the surface<br>
layers in Figs. 2 and 3 are measured as below.<br>
<method for measuring carbon content at surface layer><br>
The carbon content in the surface layers is measured by using dummy<br>
specimens (20 mm in diameter x 5 mm thick) that are placed with the processed<br>
materials to be carburized to prevent a sample (the processed material 12) from being<br>
fractured. The carbon content is measured by luminescence spectrophotometry. It is<br>
measured on the flat surfaces of the dummy specimens. The number of measurements<br>
are set as two (n = 2). The principle of the measurements is to evaporate and excite a<br>
target element (C) in a specimen by discharge plasma to measure the wavelengths of the<br>
characteristic atomic spectrum of the target element. Then the carbon content is<br>
determined by the intensity of the luminescence.<br>

<method for measuring amount of residual austenite><br>
The amount of residual austenite (ΓR) is non-destructively measured in a<br>
surface layer (a depth of tens of microns or less) by the X-ray diffraction method.<br>
The principle of the measurements is to measure ΓR{220} by X-ray diffraction.<br>
By comparing martensite α'{211} to the integration of the diffraction line profile, the<br>
volume percentage of residual austenite is obtained.<br>
The results of the measurements are shown in Tables 2 and 3.<br>

In Table 3 comparative example No. 1 shows that the hardness HV(m) of the<br>
processed material is 682HV, which is lower than the minimum limit, 750HV, for the<br>
present invention. Further, the difference between the hardness of the processed<br>
material and that of the shot materials is small. Thus the compressive residual stress<br>
does not reach the targeted stress, 1800HV or more.<br>
Comparative example No. 1 shows that the C% in the surface layer is 0.51%,<br>
which does not comply with the requirement for the second aspect. That causes the<br>
hardness HV(m) of the processed material to be low.<br>
Further, comparative example No. 1 shows that the air pressure for shot<br>
peening is 0.3 MPa, which does not comply with the requirement for the third aspect.<br>
These conditions result in the lower compressive residual stress.<br>
[0045]<br>
Comparative example No. 2 shows that the hardness HV(m) of the processed<br>
material complies with the requirements of the present invention. However the<br>
Vickers hardness HV of the shot materials is lower than the hardness of the processed<br>
material. Thus the compressive residual stress is low.<br>
The example shows that the requirement for the third aspect is not complied<br>
with.<br>
Comparative example No. 3 shows that the Vickers hardness HV of the shot<br>
materials is lower than the hardness HV(m) of the processed material. Thus the target<br>
for the compressive residual stress, which is 1800 MPa or more, is not achieved.<br>
[0046]<br>
Comparative example No. 4 shows that the hardness HV(m) of the processed<br>
material is 735HV, which is lower than the minimum limit, 750HV, for the present<br>
invention. Thus the compressive residual stress does not reach the targeted stress,<br>
1800HV or more.<br>
Since the specimen for the example has been gas-carburized, its hardness<br>
HV(m) of the processed material is low due to an abnormally carburized layer.<br>
Comparative example No. 5 shows that the hardness HV(m) of the processed<br>
material is lower than the minimum limit for the present invention. Thus the<br>
compressive residual stress does not reach the targeted stress.<br>
[0047]<br>
Comparative example No. 6 shows that the hardness HV(m) of the processed<br>
material is low and that the compressive residual stress does not reach the targeted<br>
stress.<br>
 <br>
Further, the example shows that the difference between the Vickers hardness<br>
HV of the shot materials and the hardness HV(m) of the processed material is 268HV,<br>
which is greater than the upper limit for the present invention. Thus the thickness of<br>
the processed material to be scraped is large, and exceeds 5 µm.<br>
[0048]<br>
Comparative example No. 7 shows that the hardness HV(m) of the processed<br>
material is low and that the compressive residual stress is also low.<br>
The example also shows that the C% in the surface layer is 1.03%, which does<br>
not comply with the requirement for the second aspect. The percentage of residual<br>
austenite is as high as 41%. This high percentage causes the hardness HV(m) of the<br>
processed material to be decreased.<br>
[0049]<br>
Comparative example No. 8 shows that the hardness HV(m) of the processed<br>
material is low and that the compressive residual stress is also low.<br>
Since the specimen for the example has been super-carburized (carburized to a<br>
higher C content), the hardness of the matrix is low due to carbide precipitation.<br>
[0050]<br>
Comparative example No. 9 shows that the hardness HV(m) of the processed<br>
materia] is low and that the thickness of the processed materials that is scraped exceeds<br>
5 urn. It also shows that the compressive residual stress is low.<br>
Further, it shows that the C% in the surface layer is lower than the minimum<br>
limit for the second aspect. That causes the hardness HV(m) of the processed material<br>
to be low.<br>
[0051]<br>
Comparative example No. 10 shows that the hardness HV(m) of the processed<br>
material complies with the requirement of the present invention. But the Vickers<br>
hardness HV of the shot materials is extremely high. Thus the difference between the<br>
hardness HV of the shot materials and the hardness HV(m) of the processed material is<br>
much higher than the upper limit. Therefore the compressive residual stress does not<br>
reach the targeted stress. Further, the thickness of the processed material that is<br>
scraped becomes great. This example also shows that the air pressure for shooting the<br>
shot materials does not comply with the requirement for the third aspect.<br>
[0052]<br>
Comparative example No. 11 shows that the Vickers hardness HV of the shot<br>
materials is extremely high. Though the compressive residual stress reaches the<br>
targeted stress, i.e., 1800 MPa, the thickness of the processed material that is scraped<br>
 <br>
becomes great.<br>
Comparative example No. 12 also shows that the Vickers hardness HV of the<br>
shot materials is high. Thus the thickness of the processed material that is scraped<br>
becomes as great as it is for comparative example No. 11.<br>
Comparative example No. 13 also shows that the Vickers hardness HV of the<br>
shot materials is high. Since the difference between the hardness HV of the shot<br>
materials and the hardness HV(m) of the processed material exceeds the upper limit for<br>
the present invention, the thickness of the processed material that is scraped becomes<br>
great.<br>
[0053]<br>
In contrast, all of working examples Nos. 1 to 14 show that the requirements of<br>
the present invention are complied with. Thus the compressive residual stresses are<br>
greater than the targeted stress, which is 1800 MPa.<br>
Working examples Nos. 1 to 7 show that the hardnesses HV(m) of the<br>
processed materials are high because of low-temperature tempering.<br>
Working example No. 8 shows that the hardness of the processed material<br>
becomes high because of low-temperature tempering in addition to the subzero<br>
treatment.<br>
Working example No. 9 shows that the hardness HV(m) of the processed<br>
material becomes high because the C content in the surface layer is appropriately<br>
adjusted. For working example No. 10, the hardness HV(m) becomes higher because<br>
of the subzero treatment in addition to the adjustment of the C content.<br>
Working example No. 11 shows that the hardness HV(m) of the processed<br>
material becomes high because of the subzero treatment in addition to the high C<br>
content in the surface layer.<br>
The subzero treatment is carried out by placing a specimen in an atmosphere at<br>
-85°C for 120 min.<br>
[0054]<br>
The above description of the embodiment is just an example. Various<br>
possible changes to the present invention can be conceived within the scope of the<br>
present invention.<br>
