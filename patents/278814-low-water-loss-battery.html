				<td>LOW WATER LOSS BATTERY<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
I. Field of the Invention<br>
The invention relates in general to lead-acid storage batteries, and, more<br>
particularly, to a low water loss battery with improved reduction in the rate of<br>
water loss.<br>
II. Description of the Prior Art<br>
In automobile industry, the battery grid is formed of a lead-based alloy. Pb-<br>
Ca-Sn alloy is used for the negative electrode of a lead-acid battery. However,<br>
using said alloy for the positive grid of the battery makes the battery very<br>
sensitive and reduces the cycling ability. In heavy-duty applications, it poses a<br>
problem. To provide battery grids with sufficient mechanical strength and<br>
hardness, as well as with longer cycle life by causing improved electrical<br>
conductivity, a lead-antimony alloy containing from about 1 to 2% by weight of<br>
antimony has been used for the preparation of positive grid for lead-acid<br>
batteries. The antimony also improves the corrosion resistance of the positive<br>
plate against acid attack, and increases the ability of the battery for recovery<br>
from deep discharge cycles.<br>
During the cycling of conventional batteries, which use antimony alloy grids,<br>
the decline of the voltage at the end of a recharge is recorded with<br>
progressing cycle life. The voltage decrease occurs mainly during the<br>
overcharge part of the recharge, that is, when only the gassing reactions are<br>
involved. It has been found that primarily the hydrogen evolution at the<br>
negative electrode that becomes facilitated and the reaction takes place at a<br>
lower voltage level. The reason for this behavior is that in the event of<br>
corrosion of the grid of hybrid batteries, the antimony comes out while<br>
charging. Due to corrosion, antimony releases from the alloy as antimony-<br>
(+V)-ions and is mostly adsorbed at the lead dioxide inside the positive<br>
electrode. Some of the antimony (+V)- ions diffuse through the separator,<br>
used as a distance-keeping component between the positive and the negative<br>
electrodes, and get into contact with the negative electrode, where they are<br>
reduced to antimony-(+III)-ions, and are also finally reduced to metallic<br>
antimony. On subsequent charging, antimony gets deposited on the negative<br>
electrode, that is, the antimony plates out onto the negative electrode. This<br>
metallic antimony deposition is considered to be "poisonous", because, it<br>
allows for evolution of gaseous hydrogen to proceed more easily than what is<br>
achieved from pure lead, and consequently, such phenomenon results in the<br>
loss of water. It also facilitates the hydrogen evolution with all subsequent<br>
negative effects. Excess charge develops into electrolysis of water. The<br>
process of electrolysis starts prematurely, even at normal charging voltage.<br>
Thus, the major problem with the use of lead-antimony alloys in grids has<br>
been the transfer of the antimony to the negative plate during cycling where it<br>
increases the rate of gassing. Facilitated hydrogen evolution means a lower<br>
charging efficiency, resulting in higher water consumption, increased battery<br>
temperature and reduced shell life.<br>
Conventional automotive batteries using lead-antimony grids typically<br>
containing up to 4.5% by weight of antimony, show a relatively high<br>
magnitude of float current at the completion of charging. The electrode plates<br>
in a maintenance-free battery, ideally, should accept only a small current<br>
during constant voltage overcharge so that only minimum gas generation<br>
occurs with the accompanying water loss being minimized.<br>
It would be desirable to reduce the amount of antimony in the positive grid<br>
alloy in order to reduce antimony poisoning and to improve the end-of-charge<br>
voltage characteristics. Using lead-calcium-tin alloy for the positive grid helps<br>
to make for water loss, but, in such cases, the battery becomes very sensitive,<br>
cycling ability comes down, and in heavy-duty applications, it poses a<br>
problem. Lead-calcium alloys containing traces of arsenic, selenium, tellurium<br>
or manganese and tin exhibit good cycling capabilities, but cause an increase<br>
in current and consequently result in an increase in water loss.<br>
Antimony alloys, on the other hand, give good cycling duty. Hence, substantial<br>
advantages being achieved from lead-antimony alloys in positive grids, there<br>
should be some technical solution for counteracting the undesirable effect of<br>
antimony "poisoning", to yield a "foolproof result<br>
Studies have shown that antimony does not deposit uniformly on the negative<br>
grid surface. Rather, it deposits in the form of clusters or peaks. It is also<br>
found that the hydrogen evolution rate and the amount of antimony are<br>
proportional. Antimony, which grows as dendrites or whiskers, allows for easy<br>
hydrogen generation at the tip of the dendrites. It has, therefore, been<br>
observed that the antimony dendrites cause higher degree of water loss.<br>
Several ideas have been proposed in an attempt to overcome the aforesaid<br>
difficulty/ problem. Prior art teachings on low water loss technologies suggest<br>
that various battery separator types retard the antimony poisoning of the<br>
negative plate and thereby reduce the hydrogen evolution and, consequently,<br>
water loss of lead acid batteries. The basic principle is that organic molecules<br>
released from the separator are adsorbed on the antimony sites of the<br>
negative electrode and thereby inhibit the catalytic effect of the antimony on<br>
the hydrogen evolution [W. Boehnstedt, Journal of Power Sources (1993)<br>
211-220].<br>
It is well known that the effects of antimony poisoning can be retarded by the<br>
use of rubber (natural rubber being a cis- 1,4-polyisoprene) separators. This is<br>
caused due to a chemical interaction, whereby, in the presence of extracts<br>
from rubber separators, antimony is deposited on the negative electrode in a<br>
different modification, which is relatively less poisonous, and which in a way,<br>
reduces the hydrogen evolution reaction. This results in comparatively less<br>
total antimony deposition. However, rubber separators are quite brittle and<br>
difficult to handle and also have other weak points.<br>
In car batteries, cellulosic separators were the most commonly used battery<br>
separators for decades. One of their advantages over other car battery<br>
separators (e.g. sinter-PVC separators, glass fiber separators) is the<br>
reduction of the battery water loss by retardation of the antimony poisoning<br>
effect<br>
Polyethylene separators, on the other hand, are superior to cellulosic<br>
separators, in most of the aspects, and offer favorable property<br>
characteristics, such as, minimized electrical resistance, low acid<br>
displacement, high oxidation stability, excellent processability, excellent<br>
mechanical properties, except lack of significant antimony poisoning<br>
retardation. Because of the inherent limitations of cellulosic separators,<br>
several approaches were tried in order to modify the polyethylene separators,<br>
until a new polyethylene separator, provided with "chemical agent(s)", such as<br>
water-soluble, non-ionic surfactants (said separators, so modified, being<br>
hereinafter referred to as 'treated separator", and described, in detail,<br>
hereinafter), was developed with similar effect with regard to antimony<br>
poisoning retardation of cellulosic separators, while maintaining all other<br>
superior performance properties of polyethylene separators. Antimony was<br>
found to be deposited on the negative electrode in a far less dangerous form.<br>
The afore-mentioned "treated separator" was found to exhibit the ability to<br>
retard antimony transfer to the negative plates and to reduce the water loss to<br>
the level of batteries assembled with cellulosic separators.<br>
The aforesaid "treated separator" is made from filled polyolefins and is<br>
provided with "chemical agent(s)", formed of one or more water soluble<br>
surfactants, such as herein described. The surfactants used are non-ionic<br>
surfactants, which consist of a non-polar and a polar part and are applied<br>
either on the surfaces of the separators, or on the side of the separator turned<br>
towards the negative electrode, or on the side turned towards the positive<br>
electrode or on both the sides of the separator, or these can be added to the<br>
mixture for the production of filled poly-olefin separators. Examples of said<br>
surfactants, among others, are oleylaminooxethylate, stearylaminooxethylate,<br>
tallow fatty aminoxethylate, coconut oil aminooxethylate, coconut oil acid<br>
diethanol amidoxethylate, coconut oil acid monoethanol amidoxethylate,<br>
dodecanedioic-acid-N,N-diethylamide, fatty alcohol oxethylate such as<br>
decylalcohol oxethylate, octylalcohol-oxethylate, coconut oil alcohol<br>
oxethylate, tailow fatty alcohol oxethylate, stearyl alcohol oxethylate and oleyi<br>
alcohol oxethylate, oleic acid amideoxethyiate, fatty acid oxethylate such as<br>
tallow fatty acid oxethylate and tall oil fatty acid oxethylate,<br>
oxoalcohoioxethylate with 8 to 20 carbon atoms in the alcohol residue, fatty<br>
acid glycerinesteroxethylate such as polyoxethylene glycerine monolaurate, -<br>
stearate, oleate or palmitate and castor oil oxethylate as well as fatty acid<br>
sorbitan ester oxethylate of the Tween type. The surfactant concentration<br>
which is used, in reference to the accumulator electrolyte, is chosen to be<br>
greater than 0.03 g/l, preferably greater than 0.08 g/l and in particular greater<br>
than 0.16 g/I. In reference to the separator surface, the surfactant<br>
concentration is chosen to be greater than 0.1 g/m2, preferably greater than<br>
0.25 g/m2 and in particular greater than 0.5 g/m2.<br>
The effect of said organic chemical compounds provided on the separator, as<br>
surfactants, on the performance of the lead-acid battery was assessed by<br>
means of a water-loss test, in which, automotive batteries were fully charged<br>
before an overcharge at a constant voltage of 14.4 V, started for several<br>
weeks. The current was recorded, as shown in Fig. 1 of the accompanying<br>
drawings, which illustrates a graph showing the water loss test carried out on<br>
a lead-acid battery having a "treated separator", when compared to a<br>
standard polyethylene (PE) separator. The higher current level at the start is<br>
due to residual lead conversion, that is, as compensation for some prior self-<br>
discharge. The current increases slightly with time due to poisoning of the<br>
negative plates by antimony or other elements that are more noble than lead.<br>
In the case of lead-calcium alloys, traces of nickel, selenium, tellurium or<br>
manganese and tin can cause an increase in current. When using the<br>
aforesaid treated separator", made of porous polyethylene containing the<br>
aforesaid "chemical agent(s)", the current flow was found to be reduced, as<br>
illustrated by the lower curve in Fig. 1.<br>
The weight loss that these batteries exhibit, due to decomposition of water by<br>
electrolysis, is proportional to the total overcharge, that is, the integral of<br>
current over time, in accordance with Faraday's law. The said "chemical<br>
agent(s)", provided on/ in the "treated separator" cause(s) to reduce the water<br>
loss to an extent of 30- 40%. However, this reduction is not good enough.<br>
The details of the aforesaid "treated separator" have been provided in U.S.<br>
Patent specification No. 5,246,798, which is mentioned herein by way of<br>
reference.<br>
Water loss reducing effect is also known to be caused by additives in the<br>
battery. One such additive and its use for the purpose of minimizing water<br>
dissipation in an electrolytic cell has been described in U.S. Patent<br>
specification No. 3,928,066A. The additive used is a. quaternary ammonium<br>
compound wherein there has been substituted for all the hydrogen atoms an<br>
aliphatic and/or aromatic group. As a genera! reference, such or other<br>
additives, described hereinafter, are denoted as "additive".<br>
Zinc has been shown to be a beneficial element as "additive" in reducing the<br>
float current of lead acid batteries. U.S. Patent No. 4,086,392 issued to Mao<br>
and Rao, discloses that the addition of elemental zinc or a zinc affording<br>
compound to Pb-Ca-Sn and Pb-Cd-Sb batteries in certain levels, diminishes<br>
the required float current. Mao and Rao have shown that the addition of a<br>
small amount of zinc to the electrolyte (for example, 6 grams of ZnS04.7H20<br>
per battery) decreases the float current of SLI batteries by almost 50% when<br>
floated at 51.60 C and 2.35 V. Addition of zinc to the electrolyte diminished<br>
the required float current, and consequently the water consumption in voltage<br>
regulated charging modes. In another example, zinc was added to the positive<br>
and negative active material in an amount of 340 ppm. The float current at<br>
51.60° C was reduced by 49% at the hgh float voltage of 2.76 V per cell.<br>
Smaller amounts were less effective but still reduced the oxygen and<br>
hydrogen evolution float currents.<br>
Zinc has been shown to reduce gassing, and, thus, the zinc leached into the<br>
electrolyte reduces gassing and enhances stability of the potentials. Zinc is<br>
the only element other than bismuth, which is effective in reducing both the<br>
positive and negative gassing currents. Based on the amount of zinc added to<br>
the active material in the Mao and Rao work, the reduction in gassing currents<br>
is achieved. Zinc stabilizes the plate potentials upon float and reduces the<br>
effects of other impurities which might be present particularly on the negative<br>
active material. Zinc can stabilize the potential of the active material, and<br>
reduce the float currents, which cause gassing, and reduce water usage when<br>
added to the active material in amounts of 350 ppm or more. The stabilized<br>
currents permit improved recharge and ultimately higher capacity and longer<br>
life. The addition of zinc as an additive can give the maintenance-free battery<br>
a low water usage than that which could be attained with lead-calcium-tln<br>
alloy grids. Zinc was believed to deposit on or plate out on the negative<br>
electrodes during voltage regulated overcharge.<br>
However, the above prior art approach of reducing the float currents in<br>
batteries by addition of zinc and its compound(s) does not cover the normal<br>
hybrid batteries (1.6% Sb, Positive electrode, and Pb-Ca, Negative electrode),<br>
where its effect is minimal due to the morphology of antimony deposition on<br>
the negative plate surface.<br>
Water loss is a concern area in tropical countries. Life of lead-acid batteries in<br>
tropical zones is appreciably lower than that obtained in the cold temperature<br>
climates. In the tropical countries, the challenge is to make the battery last<br>
under severe operating conditions which may include In addition to high<br>
ambient temperatures, sluggish vehicle movement in the city centers, frequent<br>
stops/ starts, rough road conditions, excessive running of the utility vehicles<br>
and less dependable charging system. These operating conditions do entail<br>
an element of cycling together with occasional deep discharges as well as<br>
high propensity of positive grid corrosion.and more importantly, greater water<br>
loss. This seems to be an area of genuine concern for those operating in the<br>
tropical part of the world.<br>
Despite the advances made in the art for dealing with the problem of reducing<br>
the water loss in the batteries, there is a continued need to address the said<br>
problem of further minimizing water loss in batteries, particularly for use in the<br>
tropical climates.<br>
The principal object of the present invention is to achieve a substantial<br>
reduction in the rate of water loss in a battery of the type as herein described,<br>
which had not yet been possible by adopting various means/ techniques, as<br>
mentioned hereinbefore.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
To achieve the object of the invention, it Is proposed to provide a low water<br>
loss battery having a "treated separator" and an "additive" in conjunction with<br>
the treated separator.<br>
Accordingly, in one embodiment, the invention provides a low water loss<br>
battery such as a lead-acid storage battery, with improved reduction in the<br>
rate of water loss, characterized in that a separator, treated to retard antimony<br>
poisioning of the negative plate is used, in conjunction with an additive in the<br>
said battery.<br>
Preferably, the separator used in the above low water loss battery is a<br>
polyethylene separator containing "chemical agent(s)", e.g. water-soluble,<br>
non-ionic surfactants, while the additive used in conjunction with the treated<br>
separator is zinc and its compound(s), and in particular, zinc sulphate<br>
ZnSO4.7H20.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
To achieve the objective of the invention, a low water loss lead/ sulphuric acid<br>
storage battery is disclosed. In the said embodiment of the low water loss<br>
battery, according to the invention, a combination of a polyethylene separator<br>
containing "chemical agent(s)" formed of one or more of water-soluble, non-<br>
ionic surfactants (referred to as a "treated separator") and an "additive" in<br>
conjunction with the treated separator are provided.<br>
The nature of the "chemical agent(s)" of the "treated separator" has been<br>
described in U.S. Patent No. 5,246,798, as mentioned hereinbefore. Provision<br>
of the "chemical agent(s)", e.g. organic surfactant(s) on/ in the "treated<br>
separator" effectively changes the morphology of antimony deposition on the<br>
negative plate. It helps in Finer distribution by making the antimony distribution<br>
more uniform by suppressing the antimony peaks [W. Boehnstedt, The<br>
Battery Man, June 2005].<br>
The "additive" which is used in conjunction with the "treated separator" is,<br>
preferably, ZnSO4.7H20, which is known from the prior art described in the<br>
U.S. Patent No. 4,086,392, as mentioned hereinbefore, and which is also<br>
incorporated herein by reference. Although the effect of reducing the float<br>
current by addition of zinc and its compound in a hybrid battery is minimal due<br>
to the morphology of antimony deposition on the negative plate surface, but,<br>
in presence of the treated separator", the morphology of antimony deposition<br>
is appreciably altered and hence this additive becomes very effective. On the<br>
contrary, common additives when used alone, are found to be less effective<br>
due to the presence of antimony peaks.<br>
Both the "treated separator" with the specific "chemical agent(s)", as<br>
aforesaid, and the particular additive of ZnSO4.7H2O are known per se, and<br>
further detailed explanations of these are therefore not necessary in view of<br>
the disclosures made in U.S. Patent specifications Nos. 5,246,798 and<br>
4,086,392 respectively.<br>
It has been surprisingly found that the low water loss battery of the present<br>
invention having the aforementioned combination of the "treated separator"<br>
and the particular "additive", such as herein described, provides, due to a<br>
synergistic effect, a substantial improvement in the suppression of the<br>
evolution of gaseous hydrogen and the retention of water, as compared to a<br>
similar battery not having the said "combination". A convenient method of<br>
measuring water loss is to measure the quantity of gas emitted at the anode<br>
due to the breakdown of water.<br>
To evaluate the effectiveness of using the combination of the "treated<br>
separator" and the "additive" in the lead-acid storage battery, according to the<br>
invention, water-loss tests were carried out on the battery. The sample<br>
(reference) battery used in the tests is a Normal Hybrid Battery. Hybrid battery<br>
is constructed to comprise a positive electrode having a grid made of a lead-<br>
antimony alloy containing anywhere from about 1 to 2.5 per cent by weight<br>
antimony and more preferably 1.6 to 1.7 per cent by weight antimony and a<br>
negative electrode having a grid made of a lead-based alloy comprising lead-<br>
calcium/ lead-calcium-tin.<br>
One such normal Hybrid battery was taken for reference purpose (referred to<br>
herein as 'Battery X1'). Also, three more Hybrid Batteries were arranged with<br>
the following combinations:<br>
(A) Hybrid Battery having an "additive" only (hereinafter referred to as 'Battery<br>
A');<br>
(B) Hybrid Battery having "treated separator" (hereinafter referred to as<br>
'Battery B') and<br>
(C) Hybrid Battery having both "additive" and "treated separator" (hereinafter<br>
referred to as 'Battery C').<br>
To prepare the Hybrid Battery of (A) type, containing the zinc additive, the free<br>
electrolyte from the Hybrid battery was removed by inverting and draining and<br>
then adding a measured amount of the zinc additive of ZnSO4.7H20 to the<br>
drained electrolyte and then refilling the battery with the modified electrolyte to .<br>
the same level and charging to ensure thorough electrolyte mixing.<br>
For conducting the comparative water-loss tests, the aforementioned batteries<br>
(A, B, C and X1) were fully charged before an overcharge at a constant<br>
voltage of 14.4 V. Each of the batteries (A, B and C) alongwith the reference<br>
battery (X1) was floated at a temperature of 60o C for a period of first 21 days,<br>
and subsequently, for a period of following second 21 days. The current was<br>
recorded for each case. The current was found to increase slightly with time<br>
due to poisoning of the negative plates by antimony. After carrying out the<br>
tests, the results were evaluated. The average values of these evaluations<br>
were then compared with each other. The comparative analysis of the float<br>
current and water loss characteristics of the tree types of batteries, namely,<br>
Battery A, Battery B and Battery C, in relation to the reference Battery X1, are<br>
presented in Figures 2A, 2B, 2C, 3A, 3B, 3C and 4 of the accompanying<br>
drawings.<br>
As shown, when floated at the temperature of 60o C, at the end of the second<br>
21 days, the equilibrium float current, as recorded, was found to be reduced<br>
significantly for the Hybrid Battery C, which was provided with both "additive"<br>
and "treated separator". Clearly, the Battery C, with the combination of the<br>
particular "additive" and the "treated separator" yields substantially improved<br>
efficacy due to the synergistic effect of the combination, that being<br>
significantly better than the Hybrid Battery A having "additive" only or the<br>
Hybrid Battery B, having the "treated separator" only. This is also evident from<br>
Figure 4, which illustrates a schematic comparison of the water loss tests,<br>
based on Battery X1 {reference Hybrid battery) vis-a-vis Battery A with<br>
"additive" in electrolyte vis-a-vis Battery B with treated separator" vis-a-vis<br>
Battery C (according to the invention) wfth combination of "treated separator"<br>
and "additive" being provided in the electrolyte. From the comparative<br>
analysis data, as presented, lead-acid performance is found to have been<br>
improved substantially by the use of the combination of the "treated separator"<br>
and the "additive", that being significantly better than what is achieved from<br>
the reference Hybrid battery (Xi).<br>
It is clear that provision of the said combination of the "treated separator" and<br>
the "additive" in the low water loss battery, according to the invention, gives<br>
the battery significantly lower water usage. The said combination has been<br>
found to inhibit the evolution of gaseous hydrogen effectively and thereby<br>
attenuating the loss of water significantly. Thus, important synergistic effects<br>
are found in using the said combination in the lead-acid batteries.<br>
The amount of the additive of ZnSO4.7H20 used in the battery of the<br>
invention should be such that it is sufficient to decrease the float current<br>
during constant voltage overcharge and result in lower water losses. The<br>
reduction in water loss as a function of zinc sulphate added to the electrolyte,<br>
is shown in figures 5A and 5b, where the battery is floated at a temperature of<br>
60s C, and in Fig. 6, where the battery is floated at a temperature of 80s C.<br>
While the amount of zinc sulphate required may vary depending upon the<br>
manner in which it is added to the battery, it has been found suitable to use<br>
the additive concentration in the range of from about 0.3 to about 2.0 gm/1 in<br>
electrolyte. However, for optimization of the concentration of the "additive" and<br>
for achieving the desired result of the invention, it is preferable to use the<br>
amount of zinc sulphate in the range of 0.5 to 1.1 gm/l in electrolyte, and more<br>
preferably 0.6 to 0.9 gm/l in electrolyte.<br>
According to preferred embodiments of the invention, although it Is desirable<br>
to add the additive of ZnSO4.7H20 into the battery electrolyte, it can also be .<br>
applied on the electrode, or it can be added to the active material paste used<br>
for the electrodes.<br>
It is to be understood that, apart from using the combination of the "treated<br>
separator" and the "additive", the low water loss battery according to the<br>
invention, also encompasses ordinary lead sulphuric acid storage battery with<br>
conventional electrodes and sulphuric acid as electrolyte. Preferably, the<br>
battery is a starter battery for motor vehicles.<br>
The low water loss battery according to the invention works successfully in<br>
case of Lead Acid batteries used in cars. However, the battery according to<br>
the invention, as described herein, is not limited to the battery for a vehicle,<br>
but, it is general. Hence, the invention can be used in varying operating<br>
conditions and for different types of batteries.<br>
Accordingly, while the invention has been described using a hybrid battery for<br>
reference, those skilled in the art will appreciate that the experiment can be<br>
conducted with a lead calcium battery, or a lead antimony battery (e.g. with 1<br>
to 2.5 % by weight of antimony in the grids of the positive and negative<br>
electrodes), even though a less significant reduction in water loss may be<br>
obtained. This can be better understood from Figure 7, which shows the<br>
comparative analysis of the water loss test carried on the low water loss<br>
battery according to the invention (Battery C), vis-a-vis lead calcium battery<br>
with both "additive" and "treated separator" (Battery Y), when compared to the<br>
reference Hybrid battery (Battery X1). All the batteries, namely, Battery C,<br>
Battery Y and Battery X1 were floated at a temperature of 60o C and at a<br>
constant voltage of 14.4 V for a period of first 21 days, and subsequently, for<br>
a period of following second 21 days. Clearly, Hybrid battery having the<br>
"additive" and the "treated separator" (Battery C) was found to exhibit a<br>
greater reduction in water loss, compared to that of the lead-calcium battery<br>
having the "additive" and the "treated separator" (Battery Y).<br>
Figure 8 illustrates a comparative analysis of the water loss test carried on the<br>
lead-calcium battery with both Additive and treated separator (Battery Y), as<br>
compared to a reference calcium battery C Battery X2' ), and the corresponding<br>
experimental result obtained thereby.<br>
Several battery applications demand superior and better cycle-life<br>
characteristics, particularly at medium and higher depth of discharge as well<br>
as battery ability to withstand higher operating temperatures, that is high<br>
temperature endurance. For heavy-duty applications, lead-calcium grid is not<br>
preferred. The calcium presents difficulties in the manufacture of lead acid<br>
batteries because of the attendant need for precise control of impurities and<br>
the tendency of calcium to oxidize on contact with air. As a consequence, the<br>
manufacture of lead acid batteries utilizing calcium is more difficult and more<br>
costly than the manufacture of the aforementioned antimony lead batteries.<br>
Addition of calcium also results in an increase in the corrosion rate of the<br>
. positive grid and deformation by elongation of the grid, that is, generation of<br>
"growth". The growth tends to impair the electrical connection between the<br>
grid and the active material so as to give rise to serious defects such as a<br>
decrease in the battery capacity and short-circuiting caused by the<br>
deformation Df the plate. Lead-Antimony batteries give good cycle life.<br>
The foregoing is to be considered as illustrative only of the principles of the<br>
present invention. Depending on the battery under test, the value of<br>
equilibrium float current and the water loss, as measured, will vary and can be<br>
experimented with. Further, since numerous modifications and changes will<br>
readily occur to those skilled in the art, it is not desired to limit the invention to<br>
the exact embodiment shown and described, and accordingly, all suitable<br>
modifications and equivalents may be resorted to, falling within the true spirit<br>
and scope of the invention in the appended claims, and their equivalents.<br>
