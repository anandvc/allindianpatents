				<td>a clamp ring assembly for use with<br>
The present invention relates to /valves of the type<br>
used primarily in the teeming of steel. S ach valves are exemplified by United States Patent Nos. 4,582,232 and 4,573,616'.<br><br>
The prior art is also exemplified b}' United States Patent No. 4,063,668. The refractory inserts in the valve shown in that patent, however, are encased in a metal jacket. hn improved-type refractory is shown in United States Patents Nos. 4,582,232 and 4,573,616 where there is no metal encasement of the refractory, and the refractory side edges are tapered in such a fashion that they receive clampinc) members which exert a force component both centrally and downwardly to simultaneously retain the refractory against expansion and cracking due to thermal shock, and also provide a downward component (in some instances upward where the top plate is :;lamped) to hold the refractory to the valve. While this has provided an improvement, the means for clampincj the refractory to the mounting plate in the situation of the upstream of stationary plate has required one or more elements which have to be bolted to a mounting plate. This takes time, and the Dolts are subject to the highly corrosive environment of the teeming of steel. What is desirable is to develop a clamp vhich is virtually automatic in nature, and who.rein the force Df the springs and the clamping to the main fr.ime is employed<br><br>
to urge an external clamping action against the periphery of the refractory.<br>
Sumnary of the invention;<br>
The present invention is directed to a sliding gate valve assembly which has a stationary refractory plate mounted to a mounting plate and secured there by the force pressed against it exerted by another refractory. A clamp ring is provided which has extending ears, each of Which is formed to ride on a clamp spring assembly. Yieldable iti^Eihs, preferably a coil spring, surrounds the shank of the clamp spring assembly guide shank and engages the underside of tne ear and rides in the main frame. When the main frame is closed, pressure is urged on the spring which, in turn, transrai-s the force to the clamp, the tapered inner edge of which engages the tapered outer edge of the stationary plate. The method of the present invention depends upon utilizing the clamping force of a valve assembly having a main frame and in which yieldable means are provided between the main frame and the mounting plate to urge a continuous clamp ring into engagement with the bandless stationary plate having tapered sidewalls.<br>
It is a principal object of the present invention to minimize the time of mounting a bandless refractory having tapered sidewalls into position as the statioaary plate of a valve assembly.<br>
A related object of the present invention is to eliminate the necessity for bolting one or more elements to a mounting plate to thereby secure a stationary bandless refractory in position.<br><br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide the above advantages in a construction which is simple, inexpensive, and repeatedly durable and effective in usage.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a clamp ring assembly for use with a valve for teeming metal from a vessel in which the valve has a mounting plate for securing the clamp ring assembly to the vessel, a nozzle having an orifice in open communication with the vessel, a main frame holding the nozzle in place which is removably secured to the mounting plate by frame securing means, a stationary refractory plate adjacent the orifice in the nozzle in the vessel, said stationary refractory plate having tapered end walls tapering outwardly in an upstream direction toward the mounting plate, said clamp ring assembly comprising, a clamp ring proportioned to surround the stationery refractory having tapered walls, said clamp ring being secured by a spring assembly on its periphery, a clamp spring mounted in the frame and then secured to the spring assembly, the foregoing refractory adjacent a teeming orifice, being secured by a clamp spring, for preloading the clamp ring prior to closing the frame onto the mounting plate, and coupled to the frame securing means whereby the load on the clamp ring is shared between the clamp spring and the frame securing means for clamping the frame to the mounting plate.<br><br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide the above advantages in a construction which is simple, inexpensive, and repeatedly durable and effective in usage.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a clamp ring assembly for use with a valve for teeming metal from a vessel in which the valve has a mounting plate for securing the same to the vessel, a frame which is removably secured to the mounting plate by clamping means, a refractory adjacent a teeming orifice in a nozzle in the vessel, said refractory having tapered end walls tapering outwardly in an upstream direction toward the mounting plate, said clamp ring assembly comprising , a clamp ring proportioned to surround the stationery refractory having tapered walls, said clamp ring having spring assembly engaging ears on its periphery, a spring assembly mounted in tlie frame and secured to the clamp ring ears, the foregoing refractory adjacent a teeming orifice, the tapered end walls thereof^ the mounting plate, and the clamp ring dimensioned and oriented to permit preloading of the clamp ring prior to closing the frame onto the mounting plate by means for the mounting means, where a first preload is applied to the clamp ring and thereafter a secondary load applied by the frame clamping means to the end that the load on the clamping ring is shared between the spring assembly and the means for clamping the frame to the mounting plate.<br><br>
of a vessel. The nozzle 18 penetrates the vessel wall 11 which is normally a steel shell, and the vessel lining 12 which is normally a refractory brick. In the present instance a stopper rod 14 engages the upper portion of the nozzXe 18 to pemit or stop the flow of steel from the interior portion of the vessel to the tube 20. The valve assembly 10 is secured to the vessel 11 by means of a mounting plate 15, the same securing the tube 20 to the nozzle plate 16. The nozzle plate 16 shown to the left-hand portion of the center line is unitary including both the nozzle portion and plate portion. Shown diagrammatically at the right-hand side of FIG. 2 is a two-piece nozzle 18, with a lower plate 19 interlocked and secured to the nozzle 18. In the application with a stopper rod, there is a risk of aspiration at any joint, and accordingly t'le unitary nozzle plate construction 16 is most desirable. On the other hand there are applications where different refractory materials may be employed, and then the individual nozzle 18 cooperating with the plate 19 may prove more desirable. Hereinafter and in the claims the term nozzle/plate collectively refers to both embodiments.<br>
The tube 20 has a tube collar 21 at its upstream portion, and is surrounded by a tube collar band 22 normally of a metal material. The purpose of the tube collar band is to receive the rocker arms 2 6 and permit the tube to be exchanged or shifted in and out of teeming relationship with the nozzle/plate 16. A stopper rod seat 24 :.s provided at the upper portion of the nozzle/plate 16 or the nozzle 18. It is curvilinear and seats with the curvilinear tullet nose of the<br><br>
stopper rod 14. The main frame 25 is shown in both FIGS. 1 and 2 and secures the rockers 26 which are mounted to rocker pivots 28 and rocker spring 29 so that the central end of the rocke^ 26 engages the downstream portion of the tube collar band 22.<br>
In accordance with the invention, the clamp ring 30 as shown in FIGS. 1, 2 and 3 is essentially rectangular and provided centrally with a clamp ring taper 31 which matingly engages the plate taper 32 of the plate 19 or the lower portion of the plate nozzle 16.<br>
Particularly as shown in FIGS. 2, 3 and 4, the clamp spring assembly 35 includes a clamp guide 3 6 c&gt;^d a clamp spring 38, the clamp spring being secured beneath the guide head 39 and in coaxial relationship to the clamp guide shank 40 above the mounting threads 41. This relationship is shown in enlarged scale in FIG. 4, and in exploded relationship in FIG. 5.<br>
Finally, tu^pning now to FIG. 1, it will be seen that there is a rocker spring cooling manifold 45 with a plurality of orifices mounted to cool the rocker springs in operation. The clamp ring 30 is provided with clamping ears 46 at one side, and the clamp key 48 at the opposite corners is of a different size to prevent reversal of the clamp ring 30. Finally, the mounting bolts 50 are employed, particularly as shown in FIG, 3, to secure the main frame to the mounting plate.<br><br>
The Method:<br>
The method of operating the subject valve assembly 10 includes mounting such a valve assembly 10 onto a vessel wall 11 and positioning a mounting plate 15 onto the vessel wall 11 and inserting a nozzle/plate 16 or nozzle la and plate 19 into the vessel. The relationship of the element:s and the sequence' of assembly is illustrated in FIG. 6. Provision must be made for a main frame 25 having rockers 26 and including a clamp ring 30 having a central clamp ring taper 33 against the plate taper 32. The clamp spring assembly 35 is also provided to bridge the gap between the clamp ring 30 and the main frame 25. Thereafter, the steps of the method involve firstly placing the clamping ring 30 in surrounding relationship to the plate 16, 19 by the opposed tapered sidewalls 31, 32. Thereafter, the clamping ring 30 is loaded in engagemert with the tapered sidewalls 32 of the plate 16, 19 by m-ans of clampingly engaging the main frame 25 to the mounting plate 15 thereby applying a compressive pre-stress in plate 16, 19. The final step in the method contemplates proportioning the spacial relationship between the mounting plate 15, main frame 25, clamping ring 30, and yieldable spring asjssmbly 35 to insure that the mounting force of the frame 2 5 is shared between the preloading of the clamp ring 30 to the plate 16, 18 and the subsequent clamping action by the main frame 25 against the clamping ring 30 as the main frame 25 is secured to the mounting plate 15.<br>
Although particular embodiments of the invention have been shown and described in full here, there is no such<br><br>
limitation of embodiments. On the contrary, the intention is to cover all modifications, alternatives, emtoodiments, usages and equivalents as fall within the spirit and scope of the present invention, specification and appended cldims.<br><br><br>
