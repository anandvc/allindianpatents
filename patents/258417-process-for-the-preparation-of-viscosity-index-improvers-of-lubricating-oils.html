Title:"  ETHYLENE-PROPYLENE  COPOLYMERS  SUITABLE  FOR  THE 5  MODIFICATION OF LUBRICATING OILS AND PROCESS FOR THE PREPA¬RATION THEREOF"<br>
in the name of: POLIMERI EUROPA S.p.A. with headoffice in BRINDISI- Via Enrico Fermi 4<br>
.0 The present invention relates to ethylene-propylene copolymers suitable for the modification of lubricating oils and the process for the preparation thereof.<br>
Elastomeric copolymers and terpolymers of ethylene (hereafter indicated as EP(D)M) are widely used in the L5  field of additives for lubricating oils (in the field indi¬cated with the term OCP "olefin copolymer") , and their characteristics have been widely studied.<br>
In selecting the product to be used in the field, as¬pects linked to the molecular weight, molecular weight dis-2 0  tribution and ethylene content of the additive are of great importance.<br>
The molecular weight of the polymer tends to increase<br>
the thickening capacity of the additive, i.e. the capacity<br>
of increasing the viscosity at a high temperature of the<br>
25  oil base. To ensure that the chains are stable under the<br>
high shear conditions of the lubricated parts of the en-<br>
- 1 -<br><br>
gine, however, molecular weights are preferred, which are generally low and difficult to obtain in polymerization plants.<br>
For this reason, it can be preferable to reduce down-5  stream the molecular weight of the polymer obtained under standard conditions in the polymerization plant.<br>
OCPs are traditionally sold to oil producers in the<br>
form of a concentrated solution (from 7 to about 12%) of<br>
polymer in oil, and consequently the molecular weight re-<br>
.0  duction processes of the polymer developed in the field can<br>
be classified as follows:<br>
those comprising reduction of the molecular weight in<br>
solution or in mass contextual with dissolution;<br>
those comprising reduction of the molecular weight in L5      mass and which put a solid OCP on the market, which<br>
can be used by simple dissolution.<br>
The known degradation techniques in a batch mastica¬tor, in which the polymeric bases undergo a thermo-oxidative treatment and subsequent dissolution in the same 20 reactor, belong to the first category. Other processes, well-known to experts in the field, are based on the shear degradation of standard polymers in solution. Other proc¬esses comprise a high temperature extrusion phase in which the polymer is dissolved in oil directly at the outlet of 25  the extruder (as described in the patent USA 4,464,493).<br>
- 2 -<br><br>
Mass processes, prevalently in high temperature and high shear extrusion, in which the product is recovered as a solid, belong to the second category.<br>
In this case, if the known problems relating to the 5 handling of low molecular weight and, in most cases, com¬pletely amorphous products are overcome, the process allows an optimum productivity and also enables the OCP additive to be commercialized outside the geographical area where it was produced (jeopardizing for a concentrated solution of LO  OCP in oil) .<br>
The process which allows the most advantageous mo¬lecular weight reduction of standard EP(D)M for obtaining solid OCPs, is the non-oxidative thermo-mechanical degrada¬tion process in extrusion, cited for example in Canadian L5  patent 911,792.<br>
Alternatively, it is possible to carry out the degra¬dation process under the conditions described in Italian patent application MI98A 002774, of the Applicant, i.e. in the presence of a substance of a hydroperoxide nature under 20 high shear conditions and at moderate temperatures with re¬spect to traditional thermo-mechanical degradation.<br>
It is also known that it is possible to improve the form stability of OCPs by using modest quantities of poly-vinylarene/conjugated hydrogenated polydiene/polyvinylarene 25  block copolymers.<br>
- 3 -<br><br>
Finally, it is possible to obtain low molecular weight products in polymerization. In this case, the products thus obtained, having the same drawbacks described above, tend to create problems in the various recovery phases of the 5 product (stripper, extrusion, etc.). These productions are normally characterized by a low productivity and frequent running interruptions.<br>
If solid OCPs have advantages in terms of productiv¬ity and logistic costs, they require, however, a dissolu-.0  tion process which is anything but simple.<br>
However low the molecular weight may be, the dissolu¬tion plant requires high temperatures (100-160°C) and high dissolution times which vary from 3 to 7 hours. Dissolution plants are also characterized by precise and distinctive L5 features which relate to the stirring systems, the tempera¬ture ranges and other characteristics (differing from tech¬nology to technology) making it necessary to have an appro¬priate dissolver for the specific processing.<br>
Traditionally stirred recipients used for producing, 2 0  by dilution and mixing of the various components and addi¬tives, the final formulation of oil and other oil special¬ties, are certainly not suitable for treating solid OCPs.<br>
It is somehow logical to believe that, even if there<br>
is no known solid OCP containing a minority quantity of<br>
25  oil, in general the dissolution of polymers containing oil<br>
- 4 -<br><br>
can be facilitated and, in relation to the quantity of oil, can arrive at not requiring specific but only possibly modified dissolution plants.<br>
Producing low molecular weight copolymers such as OCPs 5  containing oil, however, is not at all easy, and if the product were to be amorphous, there would obviously be greater critical aspects.<br>
In the first place, as the presence of oil makes the polymer shear less effective as a result of the viscosity<br>
.0 drop due to the presence of oil, this would negatively in¬terfere with the therTiio-mechanical degradation process; this difficulty could be more or less observed in relation to the quantity of oil used and the capacity of the extru¬sion plant of increasing the shear rate of the process.<br>
15      Secondly, and this is much more important, the end-product, i.e. an oil-extended low molecular weight OCP, would have a somewhat reduced dimensional stability and, in any case, much worse that the product obtained in the ab¬sence of oil which, above all if amorphous, would however<br>
20  create problems in the recovery of the granules.<br>
In other words, the presence of oil in the OCP would complicate the recovery of the product downstream the ex¬truder in a phase which is in any case critical.<br>
It has now been surprisingly found that by applying<br>
2 5  the method which envisages the use of small quantities of<br>
- 5 -<br><br>
polyvinylarene/conjugated hydrogenated polydi-ene/polyvinylarene block copolymers combined with ethylene-propylene (or ethylene-propylene-diene) copolymers, it is possible to obtain oil-extended OCPs overcoming the criti-5  cal aspects and drawbacks mentioned above.<br>
It has in fact been surprisingly found that, contrary to a normal OCP in which the addition of oil produces a strong reduction in the form stability, in the case of an OCP  in  which  there  is  the  presence  of  polyvi-<br>
LO nylarene/conjugated hydrogenated polydiene/polyvinylarene block copolymers, the addition of oil allows OCPs to be ob¬tained, having an identical form stability or only slightly reduced but in any case higher than what could logically be expected on the basis of what can be observed with the<br>
15 EP(D)M + oil system, above all on the basis of the reduc¬tion in total concentration of the block copolymer which the use of oil would necessarily cause.<br>
As the addition of oil, in fact, cannot alter the ra¬tio between EP(D)M and block copolymer  (established by<br>
20 various parameter such as the properties and cost of the additive) it would necessarily cause a reduction in the to¬tal concentration of the block copolymer itself.<br>
It has been surprisingly found, however, that neither the dilution effect of the block copolymer nor the increase<br>
25  in fluidity deriving from the use of oil are effective in<br>
- 6 -<br><br>
significantly reducing the form stability of the final oil-extended OCP. It has even been found that, within a nar¬rower oil concentration range, an unexpected improvement in the form stability of the additive is obtained with respect 5  to the analogous non-oil-extended product.<br>
It has also been surprisingly found that at a high shear rate and in the presence of a substance of a hydrop¬eroxide nature, the effect of oil on the degradation proc¬ess increases or does not  reduce the efficacy thereof. On<br>
LO the contrary, the presence of oil distinctly reduces the efficacy of the simple thermodegradation process in extru¬sion.<br>
In accordance with this, the present invention relates to a process for the preparation of viscosity index improv-<br>
15 ers (V.I.I.) of lubricating oils which comprises a mixing treatment under high shear conditions of a composition com¬prising (i) one or more EP(D)M polymers, (ii) one or more polyvinylarene/hydrogenated conjugated polydiene/polyvinyl-arene block copolymers and (iii) lubricating oil, (ii) be-<br>
20 ing preferably present in a concentration of 1.5 to 20% by weight, most preferably from 3 to 9%, whereas (iii) is pre¬sent in a concentration ranging preferably from 1.5 to 45% by weight, most preferably from 3 to 25%. The above process is carried out at a temperature preferably ranging from<br>
25  150°C to 400°C, most preferably from 180°C to 320°C.<br>
- 7 -<br><br>
The oil which can be used according to the present in¬vention is preferably mineral oil for economic reasons. The use of synthetic oil bases however is not excluded.<br>
Among mineral oil bases, those preferred are paraf-5  finic with a closed cup flash point preferably higher than 150°C, most preferably equal to or higher than 200°C.<br>
The term "high shear" refers preferably to a shear rate higher than 50 sec"^, most preferably higher than 400 sec'^. LO The oil is preferably fed after being absorbed on the block copolymer and used with block copolymer/oil ratios which vary from 1 to 5.<br>
The process is preferably carried out in the presence of a substance of a hydroperoxide nature, in this case, the 15 temperature of the high shear areas must not exceed 260°C. The substance of a hydroperoxide nature is used in a con¬centration ranging from 0 to 8%, preferably from 0.15 to 1%.<br>
Among substances of a hydroperoxide nature, the pre-20  ferred are: ter-butyl hydroperoxide, isoamyl hydroperoxide, cumyl hydroperoxide, isopropyl hydroperoxide.<br>
The process of the present invention can preferably be carried out using common transformation machines of poly¬meric materials which allow the shear rates  indicated 25  above, for example an extruder in continuous or, prefera-<br>
- 8 -<br><br>
bly, a twin-screw extruder or extruder of the ko-kneter type. The extrusion plant generally consists of a feeding zone in which gravimetric or volumetric batchers dose the various components and sent them to the inlet of the ex-5  truder.<br>
The extruder, single-screw, twin-screw (co- or coun¬ter-rotating) , ko-kneter, heats and sends the granules of the products fed towards a mixing area. The combined effect of the temperature, mixing and compression on the product LO leads to the plasticization of the various polymeric bases and, by continuing and/or intensifying the process, to close mixing and degradation. The duration of the process does not exceed 150 seconds, preferably 90 seconds, other¬wise causing the uncontrolled degradation of the materials 15  fed.<br>
In the simplest embodiment of the present invention, to which the experimental examples refer, the block copoly¬mer and oil are contextually fed to the EP(D)M polymeric base, it is possible however to feed the block copolymer 20 and oil to a separate area of the extruder following the feeding of the EP(D)M base, sufficient however for guaran¬teeing a close mixing.<br>
The  term  EP(D)M  refers  to  both  EPM  (ethylene-propylene) copolymers and EPDM (ethylene - propylene - non-25  conjugated diene terpolymers), wherein the weight content<br>
- 9 -<br><br>
of ethylene ranges preferably from 85 to 40%, most prefera¬bly from 76% to 45%. The possible non-conjugated diene is preferably present in a maximum quantity of 12% by weight, most preferably 5% by weight, and even more preferably 5 zero. EP(D)M polymers preferably have the following proper¬ties :<br>
**  Weight average molecular weight (M„) preferably  from 70,000 to 500,000, most preferably from 90,000 to 450,000; **  Polydispersity expressed as M„/Mn preferably  lower<br>
.0  than 5, most preferably from 1.8 to 4.9;<br>
** Ratio between Melt Index flow at a weight of 21.6 kg and Melt Index flow at a weight of 2.16 kg, both at a tem¬perature of 23 0°C, ranging preferably from 18 to 60, most preferably from 20 to 40.<br>
L5      The molecular weight Mw is measured via GPC with a diffraction index detector.<br>
In the case of EPDM, the diene is preferablyselected from: -- linear-chain dienes,  such as 1,4-hexadiene and 1,6-<br>
20  octadiene;<br>
branched-chain acyclic dienes, such as 5-methyl-1,4-hexadiene; 3,7-dimethyl-1,6-octadiene; 3,7-dimethyl-l,7-octadiene;<br>
single-ring alicyclic dienes, such as 1,4-cyclo hexa-<br>
25  diene; 1,5-cyclo-octadiene; 1,5-cyclododecadiene;<br>
-10-<br><br>
dienes having condensed and bridged alicyclic rings, such as methyltetrahydroindene; dicyclopentadiene; bicy¬cle [2 . 2 . 1] hepta-2, 5-diene; Ci-Cs-alkenyl, Cz-Cg-alkylidene, C3-Ci2-cyclo-alkenyl and C3-C12- cyclo-alkylidene norbornenes 5 such as 5-methylene-2-norbornene; 5-ethylidene-2-norbornene (ENB); 5-propenyl-2-norbornene.<br>
In the preferred embodiment the diene is 5-ethylidene-2-norbornene (ENB).<br>
The process of the present invention is applied to .0 both amorphous and semi-crystalline EP(D)M polymers and relative mixtures, preferably mixtures of crystalline EPM with amorphous EPM polymers or to amorphous EPM polymers. It should be remembered that amorphous EP(D)M polymers have an ethylene content ranging preferably from 62% to 4 0% by<br>
L5 weight, most preferably from 55% to 45% by weight. Semi-crystalline EP(D)M, on the other hand, is characterized by an ethylene content by weight ranging preferably from 8 5% to 63% by weight, most preferably from 76% to 68% by weight,<br>
20 The. molecular weight of EP(D)M in the feeding to the process, object of the present invention, does not repre¬sent a critical aspect. It is preferable however to have a weight average molecular weight higher than 150,000 to avoid problems in the feeding of the extruder. Exceeding a<br>
25  molecular weight of 250,000, however, is not advisable to<br>
-11-<br><br>
avoid excessive energy consumption and reach the maximum acceptable couple for the extruder motor.<br>
The component indicated as hydrogenated block copoly¬mer is characterized by a block structure in which polyvi-5  nylarene chains,  preferably polystyrene,  are alternated with hydrogenated conjugated polydiolefinic chains.<br>
Typically obtained by stepped anionic catalysis, block copolymers have structures well-known to experts in the field. They consist of a "soft" part and a "hard" part. .0 The soft part is preferably selected from hydrogenated polybutadiene, hydrogenated polyisoprene, and the hydrogen¬ated isoprene- butadiene copolymer.<br>
The hard part, on the other hand consists of sections of polyvinylarene chain. L5      In the preferred embodiment, the block copolymer is selected from SEES,  i.e.  styrene/ethylene-butene/styrene block copolymers.<br>
The hydrogenated block copolymer which can be used in the process of the present invention has a vinylaromatic 2 0 content, preferably styrene, ranging preferably from 15 to 50% by weight. The same product therefore has from 85 to 50% by weight of hydrogenated conjugated diolefin units, the above hydrogenated conjugated diolefin units being se¬lected from butadiene, isoprene, butadiene-isoprene copoly-2 5  mer, and relative mixtures. In the case of butadiene, pref-<br>
-12-<br><br>
erably at least 20% with 1,2 concatenation.<br>
The molecular weight of the hydrogenated block copoly¬mer ranges preferably from 45,000 to 250,000, most prefera¬bly from 50,000 to 200,000. 5 The ratio between EP(D)M polymer and block copolymer can range preferably from 98:2 to 80:20, due to the cost of hydrogenated block copolymers, however, it is most prefer¬able to maintain a ratio of 97:3 to 90:10.<br>
These low quantities of hydrogenated block copolymer<br>
.0 can also be advantageous due to the fact that, as they do not enter the final formulation in sufficient quantities for influencing the performances, the selection of the most economical product and with the best characteristics from the point of view of form stability, becomes much wider.<br>
L5 The process of the present invention therefore allows an OCP additive to be obtained, characterized in that it is oil-extended and also has a sufficient form stability to enable the use of normal finishing machines for plastic ma¬terials and it also allows the recovery of the product.<br>
20      The invention therefore consists in a transformation process in which the ethylene copolymer or terpolymer, mixed with hydrogenated block copolymers and oil, is sub¬jected to treatment for reducing the molecular weight under high shear and high temperature conditions.<br>
25       It is also possible and preferable to carry out the<br>
-13-<br><br>
degradation process under the conditions described in Ital¬ian patent application MI98A 002774, to the same Applicant, i.e. in the presence of a substance of a hydroperoxide na¬ture under high shear conditions and at moderate tempera-5 tures with respect to traditional thermodegradation, thus obtaining a high degradation efficiency so as to overcome the above-mentioned problems linked to the lowering of the degradation efficiency of the traditional thermo-mechanical process in the presence of oil.<br>
.0 Finally, it is possible to carry out the degradation process in the presence of a substance of a hydroperoxide nature under high shear conditions and regulating the branching degree by the dosage of a polyfunctional vinyl monomer.<br>
L5 In a further optional embodiment of the present inven¬tion, the process of the present invention can be carried out within the finishing phase of the production process of the generating polymeric base. In this case, all or, pref¬erably, a part of the polymer in the finishing phase (be-<br>
20 fore the final forming) is removed from the standard flow and sent to the transformation machine selected for the process object of the invention.<br>

the same composition as Example 1, a calibration line was created, which allowed the MFI(E) of the polymeric part of Example 2 to be extrapolated. MFI (E) =6.1 (extrapolated) 5      Upon analyzing compositions and melt flow indexes of comparative examples 1 to 3, the following can be observed:<br>
•	In comparative Example 1, an amorphous OCP without the<br>
presence of SEES having the same MFI as the polymeric<br>
part of the product of Example 4.<br>
0  •   In comparative example 2, an amorphous OCP with the same concentration of SEBS and the same MFI as the<br>
polymeric part of the product of Example 4.<br>
•	In comparative example 3, an amorphous OCP with the<br>
same total concentration of SEBS and the same MFI as<br>
.5      the product of Example 4.<br>
It would be certainly legitimate to expect that the effect of the oil would tend to considerably reduce the form stability of the product due to the effect of the flu¬idity induced by the oil and also to the dilution of the<br>
2 0  SEBS.<br>
It can therefore be expected for the product of Exam¬ple 4 to clearly diverge from that of comparative Example 2 and to be in first approximation analogous to that of com¬parative Example 3.<br>
25      Furthermore it cannot be excluded that the product,<br>
-18-<br><br>
due to the effect of 10% of oil, could annul the effect of the 4% of SEES.<br>
Various cubes with a side of about 0.5 cm were cut from each calendered sample of examples Ic (c= comparative) 5  to 4 and were then stacked so as to form a pyramid-shaped pile. The stacks of cubes were then left at room tempera¬ture for a week.<br>
The result of the tests is illustrated in the photo of figure 1, in which the three stacks in the front are those .0  of Examples 2c, 4 and 3c, whereas what remains of the stack of Example Ic is situated behind.<br>
It is completely demonstrated that the effect of the oil does not annul that of the SEES.<br>
Figure 2 compares the stacks obtained with the prod-<br>
L5  ucts of Examples 4 (on the left) and 3c (on the right). The<br>
photos in the upper part of the figure relate to the upper<br>
part of the stacks, whereas the photos in the lower part of<br>
the figure relate to the overturned stack.<br>
It can be observed without difficulty and the possi-20  bility of error that even if the product of the invention has the same fluidity (apparent molecular weight) it shows a distinct improvement in the form stability.<br>
Figure 3, on the other hand, compares the stacks of<br>
products of Example 2c (on the left) and Example 4 (on the<br>
25  right). In spite of the different concentration of SEES and<br>
-19-<br><br>
the different fluidity (MFI) (which, for example, make the product of Example 2c much more stable than that of Example 3c) , the two products do not show evident differences in form stability, and however not as evident as those among 5  the examples shown in figure 2.<br>
In order to confirm these observations, frequency scan dynamic-mechanical tests (DMA) were carried out at a tem¬perature of 40°C from 3*10"^ to 100 rad/s.<br>
The tan 5 trend with the frequency of the products of<br>
.0 Examples Ic to 4 are shown in figure 4. The observations made on the piles of particles are confirmed, as also the great difference between the product of Example 3c and the product of Example 4 which does not distinctly diverge from that of Example 2c.<br>
L5 The most evident aspect of these data is that relating to the effect of the SEES concentration. As expected, by bringing the SEES content from 4 to 3.6%, the form stabil¬ity undergoes a distinct deterioration (as is evident from a comparison between Example 2c and 3c and which can also<br>
2 0  be assumed from a comparison between Example Ic and 2c).<br>
By passing, on the contrary, from 4% to 3.6% of SEES with the addition of oil (10%), this deterioration in form stability is not observed, or at least is much less evi¬dent .<br>
25      Examples 5-7 suitably show that with a high shear rate<br>
-20-<br><br>
and in the presence of a substance of a hydroperoxide na¬ture, the effect of the oil on the degradation process in¬creases, or however does not reduce its efficacy. On the contrary, the presence of oil considerably reduces the ef-<br>
5  ficacy of the simple thermodegradation process in extru¬sion.<br>
It may therefore be advisable to use this degradation method for producing oil-extended OCP having a particularly low molecular weight.<br>

MFI (E) = 10.2 g/10'<br>
MFI (E) =8.0 (extrapolated)<br>
It is demonstrated that, even if the effect of the oil on the traditional degradation could reduce the efficacy, 5 by using the technology which envisages the use of hydrop¬eroxide, in addition to obtaining the known efficacy (deg¬radation takes place at 200°C rather than 260°C) the effect of the presence of oil in the degradation process is an¬nulled or rather, is inverted. 0  Comparative example 8<br>
18 0 g of the product of Comparative example 2 were plasticized in an open mixer having thermostat-regulated rolls at ISO^C and at a distance of 1.4 mm, 20 g of paraf-finic oil OBI 10 were then fed. The mixing was continued .5 for 12 minutes (according to a well consolidated mixing technique) plasticizing the product on the surface of the roll, and cutting and reinserting it between the rolls for at least 12 times in order to perfect the mixing.<br>
A melt flow index analysis was effected on the product 2 0  thus obtained, with a weight of 2.16 kg at temperatures of 190°C (E). MFI (E) = 6.9 g/10'<br>
This product can be easily compared with Example 4 of the invention and comparative Example 3. 25      A frequency scan dynamic-mechanical test  (DMA)  was<br>
-23-<br><br>
carried out at a temperature of 40°C from 3*10"^ to 100 rad/s.<br>
The tan 5 trend with the frequency of the product of Example 8c compared with those of Examples 3c and 4 are 5  shown in figure 5.<br>
It is surprisingly verified that simple mixing of the<br>
oil with the product previously obtained by degradation of<br>
EPM + SEES does not have the same dimensional stability as<br>
that obtained by the contextual degradation of SEES + EPM +<br>
0  oil (in the concentrations indicated in the claims).<br>
On the contrary, the product of Example 8c proves to be similar to the product of comparative Example 3 charac¬terized by the same fluidity (MFI) and the same total con¬centration of SEES. .5       From the data thus obtained, it seems extremely likely at the moment that the method, object of the present inven¬tion, can even increase (for oil contents lower than 10%) the form stability of the product obtained with the same molecular weight and EPM/SEBS ratio. 10      Example 9<br>

The products of Examples 9, 10 and 11 are character-10  ized by a SEES content (with respect to the total polymer) analogous or slightly lower than that of comparative Exam¬ple 3 (3.6% of SEES).<br>
The products of comparative Examples 9 and 10 are characterized by a SEES content of 3.53% with respect to 15  the total polymer whereas the product of Example 11 has 3.58% of SEES with respect to the total polymer.<br>
Form stability tests were carried out, completely analogous to those shown in figures 1-3, which indicate an analogous behaviour for the products of Examples 9-11. 20 Apart from the non-evident differences in fluidity (melt index), they did in fact all have a very similar SEES content both as absolute value and as a ratio with respect to the polymer.<br>
These products have a much better form stability with 25  respect to that of comparative Example 3 as shown in figure<br>
-26-<br><br>
6 for the product of Example 9.<br>
Figure 6, in fact, shows the photographs of the stack formed with the product of Example 9 in both the upper part (left) and lower part (right) . It can be clearly assumed 5 that the product of Example 9, and therefore also of Exam¬ples 10 and 11, has a better form stability with respect to the comparative example as is quite evident by comparing these images of the stack relating to the product of com¬parative Example 3 shown in figures 1 and 2.<br>
10       It is therefore demonstrated that the use of oil com¬bined with SEES not only allows a sufficient dimensional stability of the oil-extended product to be maintained, which, thanks to the presence of oil, can be dissolved in less time or under less desperate temperature or stirring<br>
15 conditions, but for more limited concentrations of oil, it can even improve the form stability of the product wit the same SEES content (with respect to the polymer) and fluid¬ity.<br>
The method relating to the present invention can<br>
20 therefore allow oil-extended products to be obtained with an extremely low molecular weight characterized by a form stability which in any case is sufficient for being proc¬essed in the finishing line of the extrusion plant. Within a more limited range of oil (up to a ratio of about 2.5 be-<br>
25  tween oil and SEES) an improvement in the dimensional sta-<br>
-27-<br><br>
bility of the oil-extended end-product is obtained with re¬spect to the reference.<br>
By lowering the percentage of oil with respect to the polymer the advantages in the dissolution of the product 5 are naturally limited (but not annulled), however the form stability thereof increases improving it with respect to the corresponding non-oil-extended product. EVALUATION AS V.I.I. ADDITIVE (Viscosity Index Improver)<br>
The products of Examples 4 and 10 were dissolved in<br>
10  reference oil SN 150 containing 0.3% of PPD (Pour Point De¬pressant) additive, in order to evaluate the low tempera¬ture properties. The SN 150 oil base has the following characteristics: Kinematic viscosity KV 100°C =5.3 cSt<br>
15  Fix Point = - 36.5°C (Pour Point = -36°C).<br>
"Fix Point" refers to the freezing point determined by means of an automatic temperature scan instrument. The Pour Point is equal to the Fix Point but approximated to three degrees higher.<br>
20<br><br>
For illustrative purposes,  a commercial amorphous product (polymer A) was tested, having a molecular weight extremely similar to that of the product of Example 10, in¬dicated as product A. 5<br>
10 <br>
The concentrations of the product of Examples 10 and 4 are intended as being expressed as weight concentrations of polymer (active part): the oil OBI 10 is therefore excluded<br>
15 from the calculation of the additive (for example the 1.8% solution of polymer of Example 4 in oil was prepared by dissolution of 2% of the product of Example 4).<br>
From the comparative data, it can be deduced that the product obtained according to the present invention can be<br>
20 used as V.I.I, additive in the lubricating oil sector with¬out particular counterindications, having low temperature properties however in line with amorphous products (pour point absolutely similar to the base oil containing PPD, i.e. no interference): this observation also being valid<br>
25  when the concentration of polymer in oil is considerably<br>
-29-<br><br>
increased (1.8%) .<br>
This experimental value confirms that, by introducing small quantities of copolymer of the SEES type and paraf-finic oil, there are no evident counterindications on the 5  final application.<br>
