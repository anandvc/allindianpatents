ALL WELDED PLATE HEAT EXCHANGER<br>
This invention is based on U.S. Provisional patent application Serial Number 60/302,219 filed on June 29, 2001 and relates to a plate heat exchanger for the purpose of exchanging heat between two fluids and the method of constructing such an exchanger.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Heat exchangers developed up to the present time may generally be classified into two categories, namely tubular exchangers and plate exchangers. The conventional plate heat exchangers are manufactured by stacking a plurality of plates, configured in a way so that two fluids, one relatively hot and the other relatively cold, may be passed between alternating channels formed by the plates. Plate heat exchangers may be further broken down into two categories, namely gasket-containing heat exchangers and all-welded heat exchangers. Gasketed exchangers have many advantages over all welded exchangers, three of which being the accessibility of plates for cleaning, lower thermal stresses, and cost per area; however, distinct limitations are present. Gasket limitations occur with temperature, pressure, and compatibility with fluids used. To overcome these limitations, plate heat exchanger manufacturers have developed all welded plate heat exchangers. The major problem encountered with existing all welded units is the excessive thermal stresses present which leads to shorter equipment life. High manufacturing cost of separating the relatively<br><br>
-2-<br>
hot and relatively cold fluid via common welding procedures and excessively thick heat<br>
transfer plates are other disadvantages,<br>
	U.S. Patent No. 5,469,914, issued on Nov. 28, 1995, Roger C. Davidson and Achint<br>
P. Mathur discloses an all welded plate heat exchanger essentially formed by stacking elongated heat transfer plates having solid metal fillers along the two elongated sides, continuous TIG welding the fillers to the plates, and welding inlet and outlet headers for two or more fluids. The continuous welding of the two elongated sides results in higher manufacturing cost and difficulties in allowing for the differential thermal expansion of the plates. In addition, this method eliminates the possibility of repairing common weld failures. U.S. Patent No. 4,688,631, issued on August 25, 1987, Andre Peze and Henry Fechner discloses a similar all welded plate heat exchanger essentially formed by welding pairs of plates containing multiple depressions thereby forming cassettes, via an electric seam welding method. The cassettes are then stacked while the extending flanges of the cassettes are bent ninety degrees and welded together, via an arc welding method, to seal off the secondary channels. The depressions are then spot welded to the adjacent plate for additional support. Inlet and outlet headers are then attached for two or more fluids. This solution improves the capacity of the exchanger to accommodate differential expansion; however, only slightly and at the expense of pressure containment. The need for relatively thick metal plates still appears to exist if substantial pressure ratings are to be obtained. In addition, repairs on the seam-welded cassettes do not appear feasible via this solution due to the continuous welding along the flange of the plates<br><br>
-3-<br>
	Neither  of the   above  described   heat   exchangers,   either  individually   or  in<br>
combination, is seen to describe the present invention as claimed.<br>
	The objective of the present invention is to construct a plate heat exchanger, which<br>
more efficiently accommodates manufacturing cost, thermal expansion, and pressure containment than prior developed plate heat exchangers. This objective is achieved according to the present invention by replacing the continuous sealing of the two sides of a pair of adjoining rectangular cassettes, in which electric seam welding has been performed, with baffle clips and enclosing such clips in headers extending the length of the cassettes. The presence of the full length headers allows the baffle clips to be applied without welding or with only partial welding because the baffle clips are only acting in the capacity to prevent cross-flow and not fluid containment. This method of construction allows the internal pressure of the secondary fluid to be contained via the full length headers which when provided with an arcuate cross-sectional shape can contain moderately high pressures with relatively thin material. The baffle clips may be altered or removed to better facilitate the collection and distribution of fluids during condensation and or evaporation processes.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
	Referring now to the drawings, the plate heat exchangers to be described are shown<br>
containing basically a rectangular core, although other shapes are possible. It is the intention of the drawings to show sufficient detail necessary for a full understanding of the invention and in no way limit the method in which the invention is embodied. Other forms of the invention such as multi-pass flows, drainable piping, manifolding multiple units together, and enclosing entire exchanger inside of a pressure vessel, will be obvious to persons skilled in the art.<br>
	Referring now to the drawings and more particularly to FIGS. 1, 2 and 2a thereof, a<br>
heat exchanger 10, made according to the present invention, is shown with a cutaway view in FIGS 2 and 2a so as to call attention to the unique method of construction of this invention. The heat exchanger 10 includes an outer housing consisting of a primary inlet header 12, a primary outlet header 14, a secondary inlet header 16, a secondary outlet header 18, four identical manifold flanges 20-26, a top cover member 28, and a bottom cover member 30. The headers 12-18, the flanges 20-26, and the cover members 28, 30 serve to enclose a plate pack assembly 31 seen in its entirety in FIGS 2, 2a and 6. Located within the<br><br>
-6-<br>
housing are three identical cassettes, each identified by reference numeral 32 that form a part of the plate pack assembly 31.  As seen in FIG 3 each cassette 32 is constructed from two identically formed rectangular heat transfer plates 33 and 33a the central body portion 34 of each of which is formed with a plurality of parallel and angled corrugations or depressions. In forming a cassette 32, one of the heat transfer plates 33, 33a is rotated 180 degrees and turned over so that one of the plates is superimposed upon the other. As seen in FIG. 2a, this causes the corrugations of each of the heat transfer plates 33, 33a to cross each other at a fixed angle and provide plurality of parallel and angled outer ridges 36 and inner ridges 37 for each of the heat transfer plates 33,33a.         As seen in FIGS. 2 and 2a, the three cassettes 32 within the housing of the heat exchanger 10 provide three primary channels 38 for the flow of a primary fluid and two secondary channels 40 for the flow of a secondary fluid. The primary fluid enters the heat exchanger 10 in the direction shown by the arrow "A through a primary inlet nozzle 42 which is rigidly connected to an arcuately shaped inlet header 12. The primary fluid exits in the direction shown by the arrow "B" through a primary outlet nozzle 44 which is rigidly connected to the arcuately shaped outlet header 14. Accordingly, primary fluid entering the heat exchanger 10 via the primary inlet nozzle 42, flows through the primary channels 38, and exits the heat exchanger 10 through the primary outlet nozzle 44. The secondary fluid enters the heat exchanger 10 in the direction of the arrow "C" via the secondary inlet nozzle 46, flows through the secondary channels 40, and exits in the direction of the arrow "D" through the secondary outlet nozzle 48. As should be apparent, the inlet nozzle 46 and the<br><br>
-7-<br>
outlet nozzle 48 are rigidly connected to the secondary inlet header 16 and the secondary outlet header 18, respectively.         More specifically and as seen in FIG. 3, each heat transfer plate 33, 33a is integrally formed with a pair of identical laterally spaced side flanges 50 and 52 located in a common plane. Also, the opposed ends of each heat transfer plate 33, 33a is integrally formed with identical end flanges 54 and 56 each of which is offset from side flanges 50 and 52. The end flanges 54 and 56 are also located in a common plane which is parallel to the plane of the side flanges 50 and 52. It will be noted that as seen in Figure 4, the outer ridges 36 of the corrugations formed in each of the heat transfer plate 33, 33a are at a higher level than the plane of the end flanges 54 and 56. Thus, when each cassette 32 is formed by having one heat transfer plate rotated 180 degrees and inverted relative to the other heat transfer plate as mentioned hereinbefore, a rectangular opening is provided at each end of the cassette 32 by the end flanges 54 and 56. The opening defines the entrance area for the primary fluid which flows through the primary channel 38 of the cassette 32. As also seen in FIG 4, after the heat transfer plate 33a is rotated, inverted, and positioned below heat transfer plate 33 with the side flanges 50, 52 in contact with each other, a continuous resistance seam weld 58 is provided along the length of each of the two connecting side flanges 50 and 52 so as to form the cassette 32 into a single separate unit.<br>
	It will be noted that the design of the heat transfer body portion 34 of the two heat<br>
transfer plates 33, 33a which form a cassette 32 is such that there is sufficient plate to plate contact points between the outer ridges 36 of adjacent cassettes 32, eliminating the need to spot weld adjacent cassettes for support It will also be noted that FIG 4 shows three<br><br>
-8-<br>
prefabricated cassettes 32, in the stacked state prior to the insertion of rectangular cassette<br>
shims 60 for TIG weld reinforcement. When the cassettes 32 are placed on top of each other<br>
as shown in Figure 4, the outer ridges 36 of the corrugations of adjacent cassettes 32 will be<br>
in contact with each other to provide a secondary channel 40 for the flow of the secondary<br>
fluid. Inasmuch as the outer ridges 36 of the corrugations are at a higher level than the end<br>
flanges 54 and 56 as mentioned above, a gap or space of uniform height and depth will be<br>
provided between the end flanges 54 and 56 of adjacent cassettes 32 when stacked as seen in<br>
FIG. 4. This gap or space is filled by use of the rectangular cassette shims 60 seen in FIGS.<br>
2a, 5 and 7. The shims 60 assist in the arc welding of relatively thin metal plates and are<br>
thereby not necessary for all designs, as plate thickness may vary. In this case, the shims 60<br>
are welded continuously along the end flanges 54 and 56 of adjacent cassettes 32 thus, in<br>
effect, interconnecting the stacked cassettes 32.<br>
	The plate pack assembly or core 31 of the heat exchanger 10 when fully assembled<br>
can be seen in FIG. 5 and includes the four cassette shims 60 and eight cover plate shims. The cover plate shims consist of four identical side cover shims 62 and four identical end cover shims 64. The shims 62 and 64 essentially serve as a top and bottom support for each of the headers 12, 14, 16, and 18. The shims 62 are sized so as to fill the space along the length of each of the side flanges 50 and 52 of the cassettes 32 located at the top and bottom of the pack seen in FIGS. 6, and 8-10 so as to have the inner surface of each of the top cover member 28 and bottom cover member 30 in contact with the outer ridges 36 of the corrugations of the top and bottom cassettes 32. Similarly, the end cover shims 64 are sized so as to fill the recess created by having the end flanges 54 and 56 at a different level than<br><br>
-9-<br>
the outer ridges 36 of the corrugations in each heat transfer plate as mentioned above. Thus, as seen in FIG. 7, each end cover shim 64 is approximately one-half the thickness of the cassette shims 60 and has its upper planar surface in the same plane as the upper planar surface of the side cover shims 62. In addition and as best seen in FIGS. 5 and 6, eight generally cube-shaped and identical channel separating bars 66 are attached to the comers of the core of the heat exchanger 10 to fill the spaces between adjacent cassettes 32 existing at the comers of such cassettes 32. As best seen in FIG. 6, the exposed flat sides of the bars 66 lie in the same plane as the side edges and the end edges of the side cover shims 62. In the preferred form, the shims 62 and 64 are welded to the associated top and bottom cover members 28 and 30.<br>
	In addition, the plate pack assembly or core 31 of the heat exchanger 10 includes<br>
baffle clips 68 which are wedged in between the side flanges SO, 52 of the adjacent cassettes 32 and tack welded at a few points to the vertically spaced side flanges 50, 52 of adjacent cassettes 32. Each of the baffle clips 68 is generally U-shaped in cross section, as seen in FIGS. 8-10, and of equal length. The baffle clips 68 serve to partially block the secondary channels 40 along headers 16 and 18 and assure that the secondary fluid flows through the body portion of the cassettes 32 from the secondary inlet nozzle 46 to the secondary outlet nozzle 48 The baffle clips 68 are arranged such that the primary and secondary fluids flow in a countercurrent pattern; however, may be arranged to produce co-current or cross-flow flow patterns.<br>
	As seen in FIG. 6, the baffle clips 68, on one side of the pack assembly where the<br>
secondary outlet header 18 is located, start at the rear end of the cassettes 32 in contact with<br><br>
-10-<br>
a bar 66 and end about three-quarters of the way towards the front of the cassettes 32 so as to allow for an exit for the secondary fluid as it flows through the secondary channels 40 into the secondary outlet header 18. On the other hand, the baffle clips 68 on the side of the plate pack assembly 31 where the secondary inlet header 16 is located, start at the front of the plate pack assembly 31 in contact with a bar 66 and end approximately three-quarters of the way towards the rear of the pack assembly allowing for the secondary fluid to flow from the header 16 to the secondary channels 40 and finally into the header 18 and exit through the secondary outlet nozzle 48.<br>
	As seen in FIG. 6, the top and bottom cover members 28 and 30 are generally the<br>
same rectangular shape as the heat transfer plates 33, 33a; however, they extend beyond the primary headers 12 and 14 and serve as the top and bottom portions of such headers. The manifold flanges 20-26 are welded to the plate pack assembly 31 to serve as both end-plugs and support for the secondary headers 16 and 18 which extend the entire length of the plate pack assembly 31. This arrangement, in conjunction with the baffle clips 68, allows the pressure inside the secondary channels 40 to be relatively equal to the pressure in the headers 16 and 18 and thereby eliminating the need to provide a continuous sealing weld between the baffle clips 68 and the side flanges 50 and 52 of the cassettes adjacent cassettes 32. The inlet and outlet headers 12 and 14 for the primary side are welded to the end portions of the top and bottom cover members 28 and 30, and to the upper and lower ends of the plate pack assembly 31. It will be noted mat the seam welded cassettes 32 are not welded to each other by a continuous weld. Instead the baffle clips 68 are fastened to adjacent cassettes 32 by a few tack welds along the side flanges 50, 52. Since the cassettes 32 are not welded together<br><br>
-11-<br>
to form the enclosure side wall of the heat exchanger 10, they are capable of expanding side ways and vertically at their side edges. This advantage is realized by having the secondary headers 16 and 18 have an arcuate cross sectional form as seen in of FIGS. 8-10 so as to allow for sideways expansion of the cassettes 32. In addition, at the rear ends of the baffle clips 68 along the header 18 and at the front end of the baffle clips 68 along the header 16, small bleed holes (not shown) can be provided in the vertical section of the baffle clip 68 to eliminate the dead re-circulation area that may occur in the two corners in the secondary channels 40.<br>
FIG. 11 is an isometric view of a modified version of the heat exchanger 10 of FIGS. 1-10. In this instance, the heat exchanger 10 is provided with rectangular carbon steel top and bottom plate-type support members"72 and 74 having a plurality of vertically aligned holes 76 adapted to receive bolts for interconnecting the plates 72 and 74. The pressure containing support members 72 and 74 vary in thickness as a function of internal pressure and the size of the secondary headers 16 and 18. Since these support members 72 and 74 do not come in contact with the hot and cold fluids, they are typically made from carbon steel to reduce the cost of a heat exchanger. The support members 72 and 74 are not needed in low-pressure applications.<br>
FIG. 12 shows three identically modified cassettes (each identified by reference numeral 78) stacked without the use of the cassette shims 60 as provided in the plate pack assembly of the heat exchanger 10. Those parts of the cassette 78 that are identical to those &gt;f the cassette 32 are identified by the same reference numerals but primed. In this instance, he plates 80 and 82 of each of the cassette 78 have the outer ridges 36 of the corrugations in<br><br>
-12-<br>
the body of each plate 80, 82 located at the same level as the end flanges 54' and 56  In all other respects, the plates 80 and 82 are identical to the corresponding heat transfer plates 33, 33a of the heat exchanger 10. As mentioned above, the shims 60 are used to improve the arc weld when attaching front and rear ends of adjacent cassettes 32 that are formed of relatively thin metal. The plates 80 and 82 use thicker metal as shown in FIG. 12, thereby eliminating the need for the shims 60. It should be noted that the cassettes 78 could be substituted for the cassettes 32 in the heat exchanger 10 and could be used for providing a plate pack assembly such as that in the heat exchanger 10 except for the absence of the shims 60.         FIG. 13 is an isometric view of an alternate embodiment of the plate heat exchanger 10 according to this invention. In this case, the heat exchanger 86 shown in FIG. 13 would be used when the number of heat transfer plates in a given unit are increased to a point where they exceed an amount that corresponds to the secondary headers increase in chord length, and to the extent of increasing the thickness of the support members to an unfavorable thickness, from an economic standpoint. It will be noted that parts of the plate pack assembly of the heat exchanger 86 is essentially the same in construction as that incorporated in the heat exchanger 10. For this reason, the parts of the plate pack assembly of the heat exchanger 86 that correspond to the parts of the plate pack assembly 31 of heat exchanger 10 are identified by the same reference numbers but double primed. It will also be noted that in this instance the modification of the heat exchanger 10 consists of replacing the horizontal secondary headers 16 and 18 with several identical vertical secondary inlet headers 88 on one other side of the plate pack assembly and equal number of vertical secondary outlet headers 90 on the other side of the plate pack assembly, thereby reducing the width of the<br><br>
-13-<br>
top and bottom support members 92 and 94, respectively, which, in turn, reduces the<br>
thickness needed to contain a given pressure. Also, rather than having the baffle clips 68"<br>
fastened to the cassettes 32" as indicated with respect to the FIGS. 1-10 version of the heat<br>
exchanger, this alternate embodiment utilizes vertical support bars 96 secured to the top and<br>
bottom side shims 62" for maintaining the baffle clips 68" in position. In all other respects<br>
and as mentioned above, the core or plate pack assembly of this heat exchanger 86 is the<br>
same (except for the number of cassettes 32") as the core 31 of the heat exchanger 10.<br>
|	FIG. 14 shows the respective primary and secondary flow patterns in a corrugated<br>
high chevron angle plate. The high chevron angle plates produce a relative low chevron angle for the secondary side entrance and exit portions, which results in the secondary side having a lower pressure drop relative to the primary side. A low chevron angle (a2) acts in a reverse manner, producing a higher chevron angle (al) in the secondary entrance and exit portions. A chevron angle of forty-five degrees or a dimple pattern produces equal geometric or chevron patterns for both fluids. This flexibility allows the exchanger to be designed more efficiently by better accommodating unequal flows or unequal pressure drop limitations without resorting to an uneven number of passes, thereby resulting in lower surface area and lower cost of the unit.<br>
FIG. 15 is cross sectional view of alternate heat transfer plates adapted to form a cassette such as the cassette 32 in the heat exchanger 10. Note that those parts of such alternate heat transfer plates corresponding to the same parts of cassette 32 are identified by the same reference numerals but triple primed. As seen in FIG. 15, rather than having the baffle clips formed as separate U-shaped members such as the baffle clips 68 of heat<br><br>
-14-<br>
exchanger 10, the side flanges 50'" and 52"' of the heat transfer plates are provided with<br>
vertically disposed dependent raised sections 100 and 102, respectively. Thus, when a pair of<br>
the heat transfer plates are interconnected as explained hereinbefore to form a cassette, ends<br>
of the sections 100 and 102 contacting each other are tack welded to form a baffle clip which<br>
functions in the same manner as the baffle clips 68 provided in the heat exchanger 10.<br>
	Various changes and modifications can be made to the construction described above<br>
without departing from the spirit of the invention. For example, rather than having corrugations or depressions of the type provided in the body of the heat transfer plates, other forms of depressions could be substituted for the corrugations, namely, dimples of the type shown in FIG. 2 of the aforementioned U S. Patent 5,469,914. Such change as well as other changes and modifications are contemplated by the inventors and they do not wish to be limited except by the scope of the appended claims,<br><br>
