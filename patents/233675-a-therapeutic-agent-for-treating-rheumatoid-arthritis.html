				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
A THERAPEUTIC AGENT FOR TREATING RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS<br>
Technical Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to an anti-human<br>
osteopontin antibody and a method for therapeutically treating<br>
autoimmune diseases, rheumatism, and rheumatoid arthritis,<br>
using the antibody.<br>
Background Art<br>
Osteopontin (referred to as"OPN"hereinbelow) is an acidic,<br>
calcium-binding glycoprotein abundant in bone. It has been<br>
known that three types of human OPNisoforms namely osteopontin-a<br>
(referred to as "OPN-a" hereinbelow), osteopontin-b (referred<br>
to as "OPN-b" hereinbelow) and osteopontin-c (referred to as<br>
"OPN-c" hereinbelow), are naturally generated by alternative<br>
splicing (Y. Saitoh et al., (1995) : Laboratory Investigation,<br>
72,55-63). It hasbeenbelieved that among them, the precursor<br>
of OPN-a has an amino acid sequence shown as SQ ID N0.1 below<br>
in the Sequence Listing, where the signal peptide is cleaved<br>
on secretion, so that the mature form OPN-a of I17-N314 isprepared.<br>
Additionally, the mature OPN is cleaved at the C-terminal side<br>
of the 168-th residue arginine with thrombin from a biological<br>
organism into two fragments M-terminal and C-terminal.<br>
OPN described above has various physiologically,<br>
pathologically significant functions, for example cell<br>
adhesion, cell migration, tumorigenesis, immune response and<br>
inhibition of complement-mediated cytolysis. Various types of<br>
receptors on cellular surface mediate the various functions.<br>
OPN has thef RGD sequence therein (for example, OPN-a has the<br>
sequence from the residue at position 159 to the residue at<br>
position 161) . Integrin species recognizing the RGD sequence<br>
such as avb3, avb1 and avb5 are major OPN receptors; specifically,<br>
the integrin species avb3, avbl and avb5 mediate cell adhesion<br>
in vascular smooth muscle cells. Further, avb3 is involved in<br>
the migrations of macrophages, lymphocytes, endothelial cells,<br>
and smooth muscle cells and the like.<br>
Further, research works so far have elucidated that OPN<br>
also binds through the sequence(sWYGLpj to 0.9(31, a4|3l and a4P7<br>
integrin species and that a difference in the mode is also found<br>
such that a4pl binds to both OPN not yet cleaved with thrombin<br>
(non-cleavage-type OPN) and the N-terminal fragment of<br>
thrombin-cleaved OPN (cleavage-type OPN) , while a9pl binds only<br>
to the thrombin-cleavage-type OPN. (Y. Yokosaki et al.,<br>
(1999): The Journal of Biological Chemistry 274, 36328-36334/P.<br>
M. Green et al., (2001): FEBS Letters 503, 75-79/S. T. Barry<br>
et al., (2000): Experimental Cell Research 258, 342-351).<br>
These integrin subunits a9 and a4 or the integrin subunits b1<br>
and P7 are highly similar in terms of amino acid sequence to<br>
each other. Additionally, the integrin species avb1 and avb7<br>
are mainly found in lymphocytes and monocytes, while in<br>
neutrophils, the integrin species are expressed very slightly.<br>
Alternatively, avbl is highly expressed selectively in<br>
neutrophils and has functions essential for neutrophil<br>
migration through VCAM-1 and Tenascin-C. Additionally, the<br>
integrin is also expressed diversely in muscular cells,<br>
epithelial cells and liver cells. As described above, the<br>
cytoplasm domains of the integrin subunits a4 and a9<br>
cooperatively promote leukocyte migration toward inflammatory<br>
sites and aggregation therein, via individual cellular signal<br>
transmission pathways subtly differing from each other, to<br>
enhance their infiltration activities. In such manner, the<br>
integrin subunits are involved in various inflammatory<br>
reactions.<br>
As described above, various types of integrin species<br>
promote leukocyte migration and are thus involved in<br>
inflammatory reactions . Therefore, pharmaceutical substances<br>
inhibiting these integrin activities may potentially have a<br>
possibility as an anti-inflammatory agent. For example, the<br>
integrin avb3 is expressed in osteoclast cells, vascular<br>
endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells and the like. An<br>
anti-avb3 antibody is now under way of development, which will<br>
work to inhibit the binding between the integrin avb3 and various<br>
binding ligands thereof to potentially exert for example an<br>
action to suppress articular damages.<br>
Because receptors of the integrin family commonly emerge<br>
in diverse tissues to provide essential functions for the<br>
control of vital activities, however, the use of antibodies<br>
against integrin for the therapeutic treatment of rheumatoid<br>
arthritis and osteoarthritis may possibly elicit the same<br>
inhibition at other sites and may also cause the occurrence of<br>
side effects.<br>
Additionally, WO 01/71358 discloses a method for<br>
screening for a substance inhibiting the binding between the<br>
a4 integrin and osteopontin and a method for therapeutically<br>
treating inflammatory diseases, using the substance recovered<br>
by such screening.<br>
Various factors have been found to implicate in the<br>
pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis. Thus, many reports have<br>
been issued therefor. However, not any of them is reliable.<br>
Further, currently known therapeutic methods thereof are<br>
nosotropic and have not been essentially satisfactory.<br>
Hence, it has been strongly desired to definitely<br>
elucidate the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis and provide<br>
more excellent therapeutics thereof. It is a purpose of the<br>
invention to solve such problems.<br>
Further, rheumatoid arthritis is hardly discriminated<br>
from osteoarthritis. Therefore, it is another purpose of the<br>
invention to provide a diagnostic method thereof.<br>
Disclosure of the Invention<br>
The inventors found that the OPN concentration in each<br>
of the articular cavity fluids of rheumatism patients and<br>
osteoarthritis patients was at a higher value. Additionally,<br>
the inventors found the increase of the ratio of the N-terminal<br>
fragment of the thrombin-cleavage type in the total OPN in<br>
rheumatism patients for the first time. Thus, the inventors<br>
speculated that OPN might be deeply involved in the onset of<br>
these diseases. As described in the following Reference<br>
Example, then, the inventors verified the findings at<br>
experiments using OPN knockout mice.<br>
Further, the inventors prepared antibodies individually<br>
discriminatively recognizing the N-terminal fragment and the<br>
C-terminal fragment from the thrombin-cleaved OPN. Then, the<br>
inventors found at experiments with the antibodies that the<br>
N-terminal fragment of the thrombin-cleaved OPN was at a high<br>
concentration in the articular cavity fluids of patients with<br>
rheumatoid arthritis, in particular.<br>
The inventors focused their attention to the co-presence<br>
of the RGD sequence and the sequence SWYGLR both recognized<br>
by human-type integrin, in the N-terminal fragment at such high<br>
concentration as observed inpatients with rheumatoid arthritis .<br>
Then, the inventors anticipated that an antibody simultaneously<br>
blocking both the sequences would inhibit the binding between<br>
OPN and integrin widely so the antibody might be effective for<br>
the therapeutic treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and<br>
osteoarthritis.<br>
Further, OPN is distributed in kidney, placenta, ovary,<br>
brain, skin and the like, but is mainly expressed in bone tissue.<br>
The inventors considered that for the therapeutic treatment of<br>
rheumatoid arthritis, the binding between OPN and integrin<br>
would preferably be blocked by a method more specific to the<br>
OPN side. Because the diverse integrin species are involved<br>
in inflammation in a cooperative manner, then, the inventors<br>
considered that it would be effective to more widely block the<br>
binding to these diverse integrin species.<br>
Therefore, the inventors prepared an antibody inhibiting<br>
the binding between the RGD sequence of human OPN and integrin<br>
and the binding between the SWYGLR sequence of human OPN and<br>
integrin and then verified the effects thereof at experiments<br>
for cell adhesion and cell migration and the like. Further,<br>
the inventors recovered an antibody against synthetic peptides<br>
corresponding to such inner sequences of murine OPN, to examine<br>
the efficacy of such antibody as a therapeutic agent, using an<br>
arthritis-diseased model in mouse.<br>
More specifically, because murine OPN has the sequences<br>
RGD and SLAYGLR recognizable by murine integrin, which are<br>
located at positions homologous to human OPN in terms of amino<br>
acid sequence, an antibody M5 was recovered as an antibody<br>
simultaneously blocking these sequences. It was verified that<br>
the binding of the antibody M5 with murine OPN and the thrombin<br>
digestion products thereof was inhibited by the peptide GRGDSP<br>
including the sequence RGD site and that the antibody M5 inhibited<br>
the migration of TNF-a-activated monocyte derived from murine<br>
spleen. It was also observed that the antibody M5 had an action<br>
to suppress bone damage when examined in a murine calvaria organ<br>
culture system. Further, it was confirmed that the antibody<br>
exhibited an apparent therapeutic effect, when administered to<br>
a murine collagen arthritis model.<br>
The aforementioned results strongly suggest that the<br>
antibody simultaneously blocking the binding on the sequences<br>
RGD and SWYGLR sites 'with human-type integrin inhibits the<br>
binding between OPN and integrin and is therefore effective for<br>
the therapeutic treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and that the<br>
antibody will possibly be effective not only for rheumatism such<br>
as juvenile articular rheumatism and chronic rheumatism, but<br>
also for psoriatic arthritis and psoriasis. Additionally,<br>
chronic rejections after organ transplantation<br>
characteristically involve vascular and bronchial occlusive<br>
disorders . The histological examination thereof suggests that,<br>
because activation of T cell and macrophage triggers generation<br>
of cytokine and growth factors and disorders of vascular<br>
endothelial cell and because proliferation of vascular smooth<br>
muscle cell elicits fibrogenesis and the like, vascular<br>
occlusion will then possibly occur (P.. Freese et al., (2001) :<br>
Nephrol Dial Transplant, 16, 2401-2406/J. R. Waller et al.,<br>
(2001) : British Journal of Surgery, 88, 1429-1441/S. R.<br>
Lehtonen et al., (2001): Transplantation, 72, 1138-1144). A<br>
report tells that OPN has a function as a protein essential for<br>
macrophage activation and fibrogenesis of vascular smooth<br>
muscle cell (A. O'Regan et al., (2000) : Int J Exp Pathol, 81,<br>
373-390) . Thus, the inventive OPN inhibitory antibody of the<br>
'invention suppresses migration of monocyte and neutrophil,<br>
thereby possibly suppressing a course toward such fibrogenesis .<br>
Thus, the antibody suppresses chronic rejections after organ<br>
transplantation, with the resultant contributions to organ<br>
adhesion. Additionally, the antibody will be effective for the<br>
therapeutic treatment of autoimmune diseases including<br>
systemic autoimmune diseases, erythematodes, uveitis, Behcet<br>
disease, multiple myositis , proliferative glomerulonephritis ,<br>
sarcoidosis and the like.<br>
In other words, the invention provides an anti-osteopontin antibody which can inhibit the<br>
binding between an integrin recognizing the site of the amino acid sequence RGD and N-terminal<br>
fragment of osteopontin, andwhich can also inhibit the binding between an integrin recognizing<br>
the site of the amino acid sequence SVVYGLR or a corresponding equivalent sequence and N-<br>
terminal fragment of osteopontin.<br>
• Further, the invention provides a therapeutic agent of<br>
autoimmune diseases, a therapeutic agent of rheumatism and a<br>
therapeutic agent of rheumatoid arthritis, and these<br>
therapeutic agents contain the anti-osteopontin antibody as the<br>
effective ingredients.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a therapeutic<br>
agent for treating rheumatoid arthritis, comprising, as an active<br>
ingredient, an anti-osteopontin antibody which can inhibit the<br>
binding between an integrin recognizing the site of the amino acid<br>
sequence RGD and a thrombin-cleaved N-terminal fragment of<br>
osteopontin, and which can also inhibit the binding between an<br>
integrin recognizing the site of the amino acid sequence SVVYGLR<br>
or a corresponding equivalent sequence and a thrombin-cleaved N-<br>
terminal fragment of osteopontin, wherein said anti-osteopontin<br>
antibody is an antibody raised against the peptide<br>
CVDTYDGRGDSVVYGLRS or CVDVPNGRGDSLAYGLR as the antigen or a<br>
humanized antibody made by humanization of an antibody which is<br>
raised against the peptide CVDTYDGRGDSVVYGLRS or CVDVPNGRGDSLAYGLR<br>
as the antigen.<br>
Still further, the invention provides a method for<br>
therapeutically treating autoimmune diseases, rheumatism and<br>
rheumatoid arthritis, including administering the anti-osteopontin<br>
antibody to patients with rheumatism and rheumatoid arthritis, to<br>
inhibit the binding between the sequence RGD of osteopontin and<br>
integrin and/or inhibit the binding between the sequence SVVYGLR<br>
and integrin.<br>
Still yet further, the invention provides a diagnostic agent<br>
of rheumatism and a diagnostic method thereof, utilizing the<br>
osteopontin antibody.<br>

Mode for Carrying out the Invention<br>
The anti-osteopontin antibody (referred to as "OPN<br>
inhibitory antibody" hereinbelow) inhibiting the binding<br>
between an integrin recognizing the sequence RGD and OPN or a<br>
fragment thereof and also inhibiting the binding between an<br>
integrin recognizing the sequence SWYGLR or a corresponding<br>
sequence and OPN or a fragment thereof may be any of antibodies<br>
inhibiting the binding of an integrin recognizing the sequence<br>
RGD, for example avb1, avb3, and avb5 with OPN-a, OPN-b, OPN-c<br>
or an N-terminal fragment thereof and also inhibiting the<br>
binding of an integrin recognizing the sequence SWYGLR, for<br>
example avb1, avb1 and avb7 with OPN-a, OPN-b, OPN-c or an<br>
N-terminal fragment thereof.  The sequence SWYGLR or a<br>
corresponding sequence thereof means those described below: the<br>
sequence SWYGLR means the sequence from serine at position 162<br>
to arginine at position 168 in human OPN, while the corresponding<br>
sequence thereof means a SWYGLR-corresponding sequence in the<br>
OPNs of other mammals, which is, for example, swine SWYGLR<br>
identical to the sequence in humans, SVAYGLR in monkey, SLAYGLR<br>
in mouse and rat, SVAYGLK in bovine, and SVAYRLK in rabbit. The<br>
OPN inhibitory antibody of the invention may be any of antibodies<br>
retaining such properties, and the method for preparing the<br>
antibody is not specifically limited. The OPN inhibitory<br>
antibody canbepreparedby using for example OPN-a, OPN-b, OPN-c,<br>
or an N-terminal fragment thereof, or a peptide containing the<br>
amino acid sequence RGDBWYGLR or a corresponding sequence<br>
thereof (referred to as "OPN-related peptide" hereinbelow) as<br>
the antigen. The OPN fragment herein referred to includes OPN<br>
fragments generated by digesting OPN with proteinases and the<br>
like, and is for example a fragment recovered by thrombin<br>
cleavage.<br>
The OPN inhibitory antibody is preferably prepared by <br>
using a peptide containing the sequence RGDSWYGLR as an antigen.<br>
More preferably, the OPN inhibitory antibody is prepared, for<br>
example, by using as an antigen the peptide (VDTYDGRGDSWYGLRS)<br>
containing both the two sequences in a successive sequence,<br>
which starts from valine at position 153 and ends at serine at<br>
position 169 in the case of OPN-a, and subsequently treating<br>
the peptide according to a general method. In order to elevate<br>
the antigenicity, preferably, a product of the OPN-related<br>
peptide bound to a biopolymer compound is used.<br>
For research works of OPN-related diseases, using mouse<br>
as an experimental animal, preferably, an OPN inhibitory<br>
antibody against murine OPN is used. Such antibody is<br>
preferably prepared by using a peptide containing the sequence<br>
RGDSLAYGLR as the antigen.<br>
Examples of the biopolymer compound to be bound to the<br>
OPN-related peptide include for example Macroschisma<br>
hemocyanin (referred to as "KLH" hereinafter), ovalbumin<br>
(referred to as "OVA" hereinafter), bovine serum albumin<br>
(referred to as "BSA" hereinafter), rabbit serum albumin<br>
(referred to as "RSA" hereinafter), and thyroglobulin. Among<br>
them, KLH and thyroglobulin are more preferable.<br>
The OPN-related peptide and the biopolymer compound are<br>
bound together by known methods, for example the mix acid<br>
anhydride process (B. F. Erlanger et al., (1954): J. Biol. Chem.<br>
234, 1090-1094) or the activated ester process (A. E. Karu et<br>
al., (1994): J. Agric. Food Chem. 42, 301-309).<br>
The mix acid anhydride for use in the mix acid anhydride<br>
process can be recovered by subjecting the OPN-related peptide<br>
to general Schotten-Baumann reaction, which is then allowed to<br>
react with a biopolymer compound to prepare the object bound<br>
product of the peptide-polymer compound. The haloformate ester<br>
for use in the mix acid anhydride process includes for example<br>
methyl chloroformate, methyl bromoformate, ethyl chloroformate,<br>
ethyl bromoformate, isobutyl chloroformate and the like. The<br>
ratio of the peptide, the haloformate ester and the polymer<br>
compound to be used according to the method is appropriately<br>
selected in a wide range.<br>
Herein, the Schotten-Baumann reaction is carried out in<br>
the presence of a basic compound. The basic compound for use<br>
in the reaction includes compounds for routine use for<br>
Schotten-Baumann reaction, for example organic bases such as<br>
triethylamine, trimethylamine, pyridine, dimethylaniline,<br>
N-methylmorpholine, diazabicyclononene (DBN),<br>
diazabicycloundecene (DBU), diazabicyclooctane (DABCO) and the<br>
like, and inorganic bases such as potassium carbonate, sodium<br>
carbonate, potassium hydrogen carbonate, sodium hydrogen<br>
carbonate and the like.<br>
Additionally, the reaction is generally progressed at -<br>
20 °C to 100 °C, preferably 0 °C to 50 °C. The reaction time<br>
is about 5 minutes to 10 hours, preferably 5 minutes to 2 hours.<br>
The reaction between the resulting mix acid anhydride and<br>
the biopolymer compound is generally practiced at - 20 °C to<br>
150 °C, preferably 0 °C to 100 °C, for a reaction time of about<br>
5 minutes to 10 hours, preferably 5 minutes to 5 hours. The<br>
mix acid anhydride method is generally carried out in a solvent.<br>
The solvent includes for example any of solvents commonly used<br>
for the mix acid anhydride method, specifically including<br>
halogenated hydrocarbons such as dichloromethane, chloroform,<br>
and dichloroethane; aromatic hydrocarbons such as benzene,<br>
toluene and xylene; ethers such as diethyl ether, dioxane,<br>
tetrahydrofuran, and dimethoxyethane; esters such as methyl<br>
acetate and ethyl acetate; non-protonic polar solvents such as<br>
N, N-dimethylformamide,dimethylsulfoxide, and<br>
hexamethylphosphotriamide; and the like.<br>
Alternatively, the activation ester process is generally<br>
done as follows. Dissolving first the OPN-related peptide in<br>
an organic solvent, for reaction with N-hydroxysuccinimide in<br>
the presence of a coupling agent, an N-hydroxysuccinimide-<br>
activated ester is produced.<br>
As the coupling agent, general coupling agents for<br>
routine use in condensation reaction can be used, including for<br>
example dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, carbonyldiimidazole and<br>
water-soluble carbodiimide.  As the organic solvent,<br>
alternatively, for example, N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF),<br>
dimethylsulfoxide and dioxane can be used. The molar ratio of<br>
the peptide and a coupling agent such as N-hydroxysuccinimide<br>
for use in the reaction is preferably 1:10 to 10:1, most<br>
preferably 1:1. The reaction temperature is 0 °C to 50 °C,<br>
preferably 22 °C to 27 °C, while the reaction time is 5 minutes<br>
to 24 hours, preferably one hour to 2 hours. Satisfactorily,<br>
the reaction temperature is a temperature above the individual<br>
melting points and below the individual boiling points.<br>
After the coupling reaction, the reaction solution is<br>
added to a solution dissolving a biopolymer compound therein,<br>
for reaction. In the case that the biopolymer compound has a<br>
free amino group, for example, an acid-amide bond is formed<br>
between the amino group and the carboxyl group of the peptide.<br>
The reaction temperature is 0 °C to 60 °C, preferably 5 °C to<br>
40 °C, and more preferably 22 °C to 27 °C, while the reaction<br>
time is 5 minutes to 24 hours, preferably one hour to 16 hours,<br>
and more preferably one hour to 2 hours.<br>
The reaction product between the OPN-related peptide and<br>
the biopolymer compound as generated by the method is purified<br>
by dialysis or with a desalting column and the like, to recover<br>
the product of the OPN-related peptide bound to the biopolymer<br>
compound (simply referred to as "bound product" hereinafter).<br>
Description now follows hereinbelow about the method for<br>
preparing an antibody, using the bound product thus recovered<br>
as an antigen, and an immunoassay method using the antibody.<br>
For the preparation of the antibody, herein, known methods can<br>
be utilized, appropriately, which are described in for example<br>
Zoku Seikagaku Jikken Koza (Biochemical Experimental Lecture<br>
Series), and Men-eki Seikagaku Kenkyu Ho (Immuno-Biochemistry<br>
Research Method) (Nihon Seikagaku Gakkai hen (Japan Biochemical<br>
Association, ed.)).<br>
In order to prepare a polyclonal antibody using the bound<br>
product in accordance with the invention, an animal is immunized<br>
with the bound product to collect the antibody from the animal.<br>
More specifically, for example, a bound product such as<br>
the OPN-related peptide-thyroglobulin bound product is first<br>
dissolved in sodium phosphate buffer (referred to as "PBS"<br>
hereinafter), which is then mixed with the Freund complete<br>
adjuvant or the Freund incomplete adjuvant, or an auxiliary<br>
agent such as alum. The resulting mixture is used as the<br>
immunogen for immunization of a mammalian animal.<br>
Any animal for routine use in the field can be used as<br>
the animal for immunization, including for example mouse, rat,<br>
rabbit, goat and horse. Additionally, the method for dosing<br>
the immunogen for immunization may be via any of subcutaneous<br>
injection, intraperitoneal injection, intravenous injection,<br>
and intramuscular injection. Subcutaneous injection or<br>
intraperitoneal injection is preferable. Immunization can be<br>
done once or plural times at an appropriate interval, preferably<br>
at an interval of one week to 5 weeks.<br>
According to a general method, then, blood is collected<br>
from the immunized animal, from which serum is separated. By<br>
purifying the polyclonal antibody fraction, the OPN inhibitory<br>
antibody can be recovered.<br>
According to a general method, additionally, an immune<br>
cell recovered by immunizing an animal with the bound product<br>
is fused with myeloma cell to prepare a hybridoma. By<br>
collecting an antibody from a culture of the hybridoma, the OPN<br>
inhibitory antibody can be recovered as a monoclonal antibody.<br>
When the antibody of the invention is intended for use<br>
in the therapeutic treatment of animals including humans,<br>
preference is given to the use of a chimera antibody (see<br>
European Patent Publication EP 0125023) prepared through such<br>
modification by genetic engineering that the resulting OPN<br>
inhibitory antibody might have the same constant region as that<br>
of such antibody for a subject human or animal to be treated<br>
or the use of the antibody having been animalized (see European<br>
Patent Publication EP 0239400 or EP 045126). Otherwise,<br>
preferably, a monoclonal antibody (animal-type antibody for the<br>
animal species) (see European Patent Publication EP 0546073 or<br>
WO 97/07671) is used, as prepared by using a transgenic animal<br>
with an artificially introduced gene involved in the generation<br>
of the antibody in a subject human or animal to be treated.<br>
In the case that the subject to be treated is human and<br>
the OPN inhibitory antibody-generating animal is mouse,<br>
preferably, human mouse chimera antibodies or humanized<br>
antibodies are used. More preferably, a transgenic animal such<br>
as mouse introduced with a human gene involved in the antibody<br>
generation is used to prepare a human-type monoclonal antibody,<br>
for subsequent use. Further, the phage display method may<br>
satisfactorily be used for antibody generation.<br>
The OPN inhibitory antibody thus recovered can be used<br>
in the form of Fv, Fab or F(ab')2 with the antigen recognition<br>
site scissored out of the OPN inhibitory antibody with protease<br>
and the like.<br>
The OPN inhibitory antibody thus recovered is further-<br>
purified, if necessary, which is subsequently formulated into<br>
dosage forms according to a general method, for use in the;<br>
therapeutic treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, rheumatism such<br>
as juvenile articular rheumatism and chronic • rheumatism,<br>
psoriasis arthritis, and psoriasis; the suppression of chronic<br>
rejections after organ transplantation; and the therapeutic<br>
treatment of autoimmune diseases such as systemic autoimmune<br>
diseases, erythematodes, uveitis, Behcet disease, multiple<br>
myositis, skein proliferative nephritis, and sarcoidosis.<br>
The OPN inhibitory antibody of the invention can<br>
preferably be used as a therapeutic agent of rheumatism or a<br>
therapeutic agent of rheumatoid arthritis. Examples of the<br>
dosage forms of these therapeutic agents of rheumatism and the<br>
like include parenteral forms such as injections and infusions,<br>
which are preferably dosed via intravenous injection and<br>
subcutaneous injection (for use as a therapeutic agent of<br>
autoimmune diseases, the examples described above should be<br>
followed). For the formulation, additionally,<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable carriers and additives may be used<br>
within a pharmaceutically acceptable range, depending on the<br>
dosage form.<br>
The amount of the OPN inhibitory antibody to be added for<br>
the formulation varies, depending on the symptomatic severity<br>
and age of a patient, the dosage form, of the formulation to be<br>
used or the binding titer of the OPN inhibitory antibody or the<br>
like. For example, an amount of about 0.1 mg/kg to 100 mg/kg<br>
is satisfactorily used.<br>
Because the OPN inhibitory antibody as the effective ingredient<br>
in the thus recovered therapeutic agent of the invention<br>
strongly binds to the seguences RGD and SWYGLR in OPN, the OPN<br>
inhibitory antibody possibly inhibits the binding between these<br>
OPN regions and integrin, to consequently suppress the<br>
exacerbation of the symptoms of rheumatism, and rheumatoid<br>
arthritis and other autoimmune diseases.<br>
Because the OPN inhibitory antibody of the invention<br>
specifically binds to the OPN side, not to the integrin side,<br>
the antibody potentially never inhibits other significant<br>
functions of integrin, so it is expected that disadvantageous<br>
side effects can be avoided.<br>
Further, the OPN inhibitory antibody of the invention can<br>
also be used for the purpose of screening for a therapeutic agent<br>
of autoimmune diseases. As described above, a compound<br>
inhibiting the binding between the RGD sequence of OPN and<br>
integrin and inhibiting the binding between the SWYGLR<br>
sequence and integrin possibly serves as a therapeutic agent<br>
of autoimmune diseases . Thus, the applicability of a substance<br>
to be screened (test substance) as a therapeutic agent of<br>
autoimmune diseases can be evaluated in a reaction system<br>
prepared by adding the test substance and the OPN inhibitory<br>
antibody in a competitive manner to an assay system in the<br>
presence of given amounts of OPN and integrin, to assay the<br>
extent of the inhibition of the binding between the OPN and<br>
integrin relative to the amount of the OPN inhibitory antibody<br>
used.<br>
Similarly, a compound inhibiting the binding between the<br>
RGD sequence of OPN and integrin and inhibiting the binding<br>
between the SWYGLR sequence and integrin possibly serves as<br>
a therapeutic agent of rheumatism and rheumatoid arthritis.<br>
When the OPN inhibitory antibody is used to compose the same<br>
reaction system as described above, therefore, the reaction<br>
system can be used for screening for rheumatism and rheumatoid<br>
arthritis.<br>
Furthermore, the OPN inhibitory antibody of the invention<br>
can be utilized as a diagnostic agent of rheumatism. As<br>
described above, it is demonstrated that a high concentration<br>
of the N-terminal fragment of thrombin-cleaved OPN is<br>
particularly found in the arthrosis of a patient with rheumatoid<br>
arthritis. Thus, the assay of OPN or the N-terminal fragment<br>
thereof in a sample using the OPN inhibitory antibody can serve<br>
for the diagnosis of rheumatism. As the method therefor, the<br>
following various methods for use as general immunochemical<br>
assay methods ["Hybridoma Method and Monoclonal Antibody",<br>
issued by R&amp;D Planning KK., pp. 30-53, March 5, 1982] are<br>
applicable: radioimmunoassay method (RIA) , ELISA (E. Engvall<br>
etal., (1980) : Methods in Enzymol., 70, 419-439), fluorescent<br>
antibodymethod, plaque method, spot method, aggregationmethod,<br>
Ouchterlony test and the like.<br>
The method can be selected appropriately from various<br>
standpoints. In view of sensitivity, simplicity and the like,<br>
ELISA is preferable. The method more preferably includes<br>
immobilizing the OPN inhibitory antibody of the invention on<br>
a carrier and labeling an antibody recognizing an OPN site<br>
different from that of the OPN inhibitory antibody of the<br>
invention, to detect OPN or the N-terminal fragment thereof.<br>
Thus, such detection method can be used for a diagnostic agent<br>
of rheumatoid arthritis.<br>
The labeling substance for use in the antibody labeling<br>
includes enzymes such as horseradish peroxidase (referred to<br>
as "HRP" hereinafter), alkali phosphatase (referred to as "AP"<br>
hereinafter) and the like, fluorescent substances such as<br>
fluorescein isocyanate, and rhodamine and the like, radioactive<br>
substances such as 32P, 125I and the like, chemiluminescent<br>
substances, and the like. The procedure of sandwich method as<br>
one of more specific detection methods of the OPN isoforms is<br>
described below. Specifically, the procedure includes a first<br>
step (a) of immobilizing the antibody against an OPN isoform<br>
of the invention on a carrier, a second step (b) of blocking<br>
the carrier surface with no immobilized antibody thereon with<br>
amaterialwithno relation with the antigen, for example protein.<br>
The procedure further includes a step (c) of adding a sample<br>
containing various concentrations of the OPN isoform to the<br>
resulting mixture, to generate an OPN isoform-antibody complex,<br>
a step (d) of subsequently adding a labeled anti-OPN isoform<br>
antibody to allow the antibody to bind to the immobilized<br>
antigen-antibody complex, and a final step (e) of assaying the<br>
amount of the label bound to the carrier to determine the amount<br>
of the OPN isoform free in the sample, based on a preliminarily<br>
prepared standard curve.<br>
The carrier used at the step (a) for antibody<br>
immobilization includes, but is not specifically limited to any<br>
carriers for routine use in immunochemical assay methods. The<br>
carrier can include for example polystyrene 96-well microtiter<br>
plate or microtiter plate of amino group-bound type. For<br>
further antibody immobilization, for example, a buffer<br>
containing the antibody is satisfactorily added to and<br>
incubated with the carrier. Known buffers can be used as the<br>
buffer, which is for example 10 mM PBS. The concentration of<br>
the antibody in a buffer may be selected within a wide range,<br>
but generally, the concentration is appropriately about 0.01<br>
to 100 mg/ml and preferably 0.1 to 20 mg/ml • Additionally, the<br>
amount of the buffer is 300 ml/well or less and preferably about<br>
20 to 150 ml/well, when a 96-well microtiter plate is used as<br>
a carrier. Further, the incubation conditions include but are<br>
not specifically limited to overnight incubation at about 4 °C,<br>
which is generally appropriate.<br>
At the step (b) of blocking, further, blocking is done<br>
for the purpose of preventing non-specific adsorption on a<br>
carrier because a part possibly adsorbable on a carrier despite<br>
no relation with the antigen-antibody reaction may potentially<br>
exist in OPN in a sample to be added at the following step. As<br>
the blocking agent, for example, bovine serum albumin (BSA) and<br>
skim milk solution can be used. Otherwise, commercially<br>
available blocking agents such as Block-Ace (manufactured by<br>
Dainippon Pharmaceutical Co ., Ltd. ; Code No . UK-25B) maybe used.<br>
Specifically but not for limitation, blocking is done by adding<br>
for example an appropriate volume of Block-Ace to a part with<br>
the antigen immobilized thereon, for overnight incubation at<br>
about 4 °C and rinsing the resulting part with a buffer. The<br>
buffer includes for example but is not specifically limited to<br>
a buffer of the composition of 10 mM PBS, pH 7.2, C.8 % (w/v)<br>
NaCl, 0.02 % (w/v) KCl, and 0.02 % (v/v) Tween 20.<br>
At the step (c) , then, a sample containing an OPN isoform<br>
is put in contact to the immobilized antibody, to allow the OPN<br>
isoform to be captured on the immobilized antibody and prepare<br>
an immobilized antibody-OPN isoform complex. With no<br>
limitation, the reaction is done at about 37 °C for about one<br>
hour. After the completion of the reaction, the carrier is<br>
rinsed with a buffer, to discard unreactive protein and the like .<br>
A buffer of the composition of 10 mM PBS, pH 7.2 and 0.05 % (v/v)<br>
Tween 20 is preferable as the buffer to be used for the reaction.<br>
At the step (d), further, an immobilized antibody-OPN<br>
isoform-labeled antibody complex is formed by adding a labeled<br>
antibody recognizing another epitope of the OPN isoform<br>
captured on the immobilized antibody. After completion of the<br>
reaction, preferably, the carrier is rinsed with a buffer, to<br>
discard unreactive protein and the like. The buffer described<br>
for the step (c) is used as the buffer for the reaction.<br>
The labeled antibody to be used at the step (d) is required<br>
to recognize an epitope differing from the epitope recognized<br>
by the immobilized antibody at the step (a) . When a polyclonal<br>
antibody recognizing the former-half domain of the OPN isoform<br>
is used as the immobilized antibody, for example, a polyclonal<br>
antibody recognizing the latter-half domain of the OPN isoform<br>
is used as an antibody labeled with a bound enzyme (for example,<br>
HRP or AP or the like) . The use of such antibodies recognizing<br>
different sites as described above enables highly sensitive,<br>
specific assay of an OPN isoform generated by alternative<br>
splicing.<br>
The quantity of the labeled antibody to be used at the<br>
step (d) is preferably about 5,000 to 10,000-fold the quantity<br>
of the immobilized antibody bound to the carrier. Desirably,<br>
the labeled antibody diluted preferably to a final peak<br>
absorbance value of 1.5 to 2.0 at the final assay is used for<br>
reaction. For such dilution, buffers can be used, while the<br>
reaction is done preferably at about 37 °C for about 30 minutes,<br>
followed by rinsing with buffers after completion of the<br>
reaction. But the reaction is not limited to such conditions.<br>
The reactions described above enable the binding of the<br>
antibody-OPN isoform-labeled antibody complex to the carrier.<br>
At the step (e) , finally, a chromogenic substrate<br>
solution reacting with the labeling substance in the<br>
immobilized antibody-OPN isoform-labeled antibody complex is<br>
added for absorbance measurement to calculate the OPN quantity<br>
based on a standard curve.<br>
When an enzyme peroxidase is used as the labeling<br>
substance to label an antibody, for example, a chromogenic<br>
substrate solution containing hydrogen peroxide and 3, 3', 5,<br>
5'-tetramethylbenzine (TMB) or o-phenylenediamine (OPD) can be<br>
used. With no specific limitation, chromogenic reaction is<br>
done by adding a chromogenic substrate solution for reaction<br>
at about 25 °C for about 20 minutes, and subsequently adding<br>
1N sulfuric acid to terminate the enzyme reaction. In the case<br>
that TMB is used, the progress of chromogenic reaction is assayed<br>
on the basis of the absorbance at 450 ran. In the case that an<br>
enzyme AP is used as a labeling substance, alternatively, an<br>
appropriate method includes chromogenic reaction using p-<br>
nitrophenylphosphoric acid (pNPP) as a substrate, the addition<br>
of 2N NaOH to terminate the enzyme reaction and the measurement<br>
of the absorbance at 415 nm.<br>
Using a standard curve preliminarily prepared on the<br>
basis of the absorbance of a reaction solution with addition<br>
of known concentrations of an OPN isoform, the concentration<br>
of the OPN isoform in a sample can be calculated.<br>
The method for detecting the OPN isoform in accordance<br>
with the invention is used for the elucidation of OPN functions,<br>
and the diagnosis and therapeutic treatment of diseases for<br>
which OPN is responsible. One example of the use of the method<br>
includes a detection kit of inflammatory abnormalities by which<br>
rheumatism and rheumatoid arthritis for example can be<br>
discriminated, the kit working for separately detecting the<br>
N-terminal fragment of thrombin-cleaved OPN and non-<br>
cleavage-type OPN, thereby detecting the presence or absence<br>
of any inflammatory abnormalities.<br>
As described above, the N-terminal fragment of<br>
thrombin-cleaved OPN is likely observed at a high concentration<br>
in the articular cavities of patients with rheumatoid arthritis,<br>
in particular. In patients with osteoarthritis, however, the<br>
tendency is significantly low. As described above, the ratio<br>
of the N-terminal fragment occupying OPN in articular cavity<br>
varies in the individual patients. In order to<br>
discriminatively diagnose rheumatism and osteoarthritis,<br>
therefore, the ratio of the N-terminal fragment occupying the<br>
total OPN can be measured, satisfactorily.<br>
As a more specific example, antibodies against individual<br>
peptides of the following three sequences common to all three<br>
OPN isoforms namely OPN-a, OPN-b and OPN-c should be raised.<br>
CVDTYDGRGDSWYGLRS<br>
(C+V153 to S169) (1)<br>
KSKKFRRPDIQYPDATDEC<br>
(K170 to E187+C) (2)<br>
IPVKQADSGSSEEKQC<br>
(117 to Q31+C) (3)<br>
Among them, the sequence (1) is present on the N-terminal<br>
side of the thrombin-cleaved site, and is present common to the<br>
full-length OPN as the thrombin-non-cleavage type and the<br>
N-terminal fragment. Alternatively, the sequence (2) is<br>
present on the C-terminal side of the thrombin-cleaved site and<br>
is present in the full-length OPN of the thrombin-non-cleavage<br>
type but is never contained in the N-terminal fragment. Further,<br>
the sequence (3) corresponds to the amino acid residues at<br>
positions 17 to 31 on the N-terminal side of OPN and is present<br>
common to the full-length OPN as the thrombin-non-cleavage type<br>
and the N-terminal fragment. The diagnosis kit for<br>
discrimination between rheumatism patients and osteoarthritis<br>
patients can be composed of two types of immunodetection<br>
reagents utilizing antibodies individually corresponding to<br>
the three types of sequences. In other words, a first<br>
immunodetection reagent using two types of antibodies against<br>
the peptides represented by the sequences (3) and (2) works for<br>
the assay of thrombin-non-cleavage type OPN commonly recognized<br>
by both the antibodies in a sample. Then, detection can be done<br>
by the same method as the sandwich method, which includes<br>
immobilizing for example an antibody against the peptide of the<br>
sequence (3) on a carrier, allowing the antibody to react with<br>
a sample from a patient, rinsing the carrier, and subsequently<br>
adding an antibody against the peptide of the sequence (2) as<br>
a labeling antibody. In the case of a second immunodetection<br>
reagent, additionally, two antibodies against the peptides<br>
represented by the sequences (1) and (3) are used to assay a<br>
total of the thrombin-non-cleavage-type OPN and the N-terminal<br>
fragment generated by thrombin cleavage in a sample, which are<br>
commonly recognized by both the antibodies. In that case,<br>
detection can be done by the same method as the sandwich method,<br>
which includes immobilizing for example an antibody against the<br>
peptide of the sequence (1) on a carrier, allowing the antibody<br>
to react with a sample from a patient, rinsing the ceirrier, and<br>
subsequently adding an antibody against the peptide of the<br>
sequence (3) as a labeling antibody. Subsequently,, the assay<br>
results of the sample from the same patient with the two types<br>
of the immunodetection reagents are compared together, to<br>
elucidate the ratio of the thrombin-cleavage-generated N-<br>
terminal fragment in the total OPN in the patient, which enables<br>
discrimination between rheumatism and osteoarthritis.<br>
Examples<br>
The invention will now be described in more detail in the<br>
following Examples and Reference Example. But the invention<br>
is not limited to these Examples-.<br>
Example 1<br>
Cloning, construction, purification and reagents for<br>
GST-OPN fusion protein:<br>
Cloning and protein purification were done essentially<br>
according to the method described in the reference (S. Kon et<br>
al., (2000): J. Cell. Biochem. 77: 487-498).<br>
The cDNAs of the human OPN isoforms i.e. OPN-a and OPN-b<br>
were recovered as follows . Using RNAprepared fromNRC-12 cells<br>
of a human kidney cancer cell line as template, cDNA was<br>
synthetically prepared; using the cDNA as template, PCR was done<br>
using the following primers OPN-5 and OPN-3 to recover cDNAs<br>
encoding the full-length human OPN-a and OPN-b individually<br>
including the respective signal peptide regions.<br>
In the manner as described in the reference, then, the<br>
thus cloned cDNAs of OPN-a and OPN-b were inserted in pGEX4T<br>
vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Tokyo, Japan) so that the<br>
cDNAs might be in the same reading frame as that of the GST gene<br>
(glutathiones-transferase; EC2.5.1.18), for expression in the<br>
form of GST fusion protein, using Escherichia coli JM109 (the<br>
GST-OPN fusion proteins thus recovered are referred to as<br>
"GST-OPN-a" and "GST-OPN-b" hereinbelow).<br>
The cDNA encoding human OPN-c isoform was prepared by<br>
two-step PCR using the OPN-a cDNA as template. At a first step,<br>
PCR was individually done using OPN-5 and the following OPNct-3<br>
primer or the following OPNct-5 and OPN-3 primer; the resulting<br>
two PCR products were mixed together, thermally treated, and<br>
gradually cooled for annealing, followed by addition of an<br>
enzyme for extension. At a second step, subsequently, PCR was<br>
done using the OPN-5 and OPN-3 primers, to recover cDNA encoding<br>
the full-length human OPN-c including the signal peptide region.<br>
The cDNA of the isoform c was integrated in pGEX4T vector by<br>
the same method as for the isoforms a and b, for preparing a<br>
GST fusion protein (referred to as "GST-OPN-c" hereinafter).<br>
OPNct-3:<br>
The cDNA encoding the half moiety at the amino terminal<br>
side (M1-R168) from the thrombin-cleaved site of OPN-a was<br>
recovered by PCR using the OPN-a cDNA as template and OPN-5<br>
together with the following OPNnh-3 primer described below. By<br>
the same method as for the isoforms a and b, the resulting cDNA<br>
was integrated in the pGEX4T vector to prepare a GST protein<br>
(referred to as "GST-Nhalf" hereinbelow) .<br>
The osteopontin protein (hOPN C half) on the carboxyl side<br>
from the thrombin-cleaved site of OPN-a was prepared by two-step<br>
PCR using the OPN-a cDNA as template. At a first step, PCR was<br>
done, individually, using OPN-5, the following OPNch-3 primer,<br>
the following OPNch-5 and the OPN-3 primer. At a second step,<br>
PCR was done using the OPN-5 and OPN-3 primers, to prepare the<br>
OPN protein on the carboxyl side. By the same method as for<br>
the culture supernatant of the CHO/OPN-a cell was subjected to<br>
ion exchange column chromatography using a DEAE-Sepharose CL-6B<br>
column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Tokyo, Japan) and gel<br>
filtration chromatography on an Ultrogel AcA44 column<br>
(manufactured by BioSepra SA), and continuously to reverse-<br>
phase column chromatography on a RESOURCE RPC column (Amersham<br>
Pharmacia Biotech, Tokyo, Japan) . In such manner, purification<br>
was completed.<br>
Various peptides purchased from Sigma Genosis Japan were<br>
used for research works on immune sensitization and bindings;<br>
otherwise, such peptides were recovered by chemical synthesis<br>
by the Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) process with a<br>
peptide synthesizer (Model 432 A; manufactured by PerkinElmer<br>
Life Science, Inc.) and purification by C18 reverse-phase<br>
column chromatography.<br>
Example 2<br>
Production of monoclonal antibody:<br>
Synthetic peptides corresponding to the inner sequences<br>
of human OPN were prepared, as shown below, which were then used<br>
for immunization.<br>
Peptide 1:<br>
CVDTYDGRGDSWYGLRS (C+V153 to S169)<br>
Peptide 2:<br>
CIDSQELSKVSREFHSH (C+I261 to H276)<br>
33<br>
Specifically, the Peptide 1 has the sequences RGD and<br>
SWYGLR recognizing the avp3 and a9pl integrin receptors,<br>
respectively.<br>
These peptides were bound to thyroglobulin, which were<br>
then used for murine immunization according to a general method.<br>
Continuously, splenocytes were isolated from the immunizedmice,<br>
which were then subjected to cell fusion with a murine myeloma<br>
cell P3-X63-Ag8-653, using polyethylene glycol. According to<br>
the method described in the reference (M. Kinebuchi et al.,<br>
(1991): J. Immunol., 146, 3721-3728), a hybridoma reacting with<br>
each of the peptides used for the immunization was selected.<br>
From mice immunized with the peptides 1 and 2 were<br>
recovered monoclonal antibodies designated 2K1 and 4C1,<br>
respectively.  The hybridoma generating the monoclonal<br>
antibody 2K1 was deposited as FERMBP-7883 at the Patent Organism<br>
Depository Center, the National Institute of Advanced<br>
Industrial Science andTechnology (AIST Tsukuba Central 6, 1-1-1,<br>
Higashi, Tsukuba-shi, Ibaraki 305-8566, Japan) on the date of<br>
June 20, 2001. Additionally, the monoclonal antibody 53 (mAb53)<br>
was recovered by immunization with the full-length recombinant<br>
human OPN (D. S. Bautista et al., (1994): J. Biol. Chem., 269,<br>
23280-23285).<br>
Example 3<br>
Reactivity of OPN and thrombin digestion products thereof<br>
with the monoclonal antibodies:<br>
The binding potencies of the monoclonal antibodies 2K1<br>
and 4C1 recovered in the Example 2 to OPN and the thrombin<br>
digestion products thereof were tested by Western blotting<br>
method. It was found that the antibody 2K1 reacted with<br>
GST-OPN-a, GST-OPN-b, GST-OPN-c and GST-Nhalf. The antibody<br>
4C1 reacted with GST-OPN-a, GST-OPN-b, GST-OPN-c and GST-Chalf .<br>
Further, these monoclonal antibodies were not only bound to the<br>
recombinant OPNs of sugar-chain-unbound type as generated in<br>
Escherichia coli but also reacted with the CHO/OPN-a protein<br>
of sugar-chain-bound type and the thrombin digestion products<br>
thereof (referred to as "thrombin-cleaved OPN" hereinafter).<br>
Example 4<br>
Inhibition of cell adhesion to OPN via the monoclonal<br>
antibodies:<br>
It was examined by the following method as to whether or<br>
not the monoclonal antibodies inhibited cell adhesion to OPN.<br>
First, a 96-well plate was precoated with various<br>
concentrations of the CHO/OPN-a at 4 °C overnight, which was<br>
then treated with 0.5 % BSA in PBS under conditions of 37 °C<br>
for 10 minutes, so as to block non-specific adhesion. A human<br>
fibroblast TIG-7 or SW480 cell transformed with the cDNA of an<br>
integrin subunit <x9 to as sw480 cell></x9>
hereinafter) was suspended in D-MEM containing 0.25 % BSA; 200<br>
ml of the resulting cell suspension (at a cell concentration<br>
of 5 x 104 cells/well) was injected in a 96-well plate precoated<br>
with the CHO/OPN-a or nOPN, in the presence or absence of various<br>
concentrations of the monoclonal antibodies or synthetic<br>
peptides, for incubation at 37 °C for one hour.<br>
The culture medium was discarded from the plate, and all<br>
the wells were rinsed twice with D-MEM containing 0.25 % BSA.<br>
The adherent cells were fixed and stained with 0.5 % crystal<br>
violet in 20 % methanol for 30 minutes.<br>
All the wells were rinsed three times with water, and the<br>
adherent cells were then solubilized into 20 % acetic acid. The<br>
resulting supernatant recovered from each well was analyzed<br>
with an immunoreader, to measure the absorbance at 590 nm to<br>
determine the relative count of the cells adhering to the well.<br>
All the assays were done in a triplicate fashion, and at least<br>
three independent experiments were performed. The values shown<br>
represent mean from three independent experiments.<br>
It has been known that TIG-7 highly adheres to OPN, but<br>
as shown in Fig. 1A, the adhesion is apparently inhibited by<br>
the peptide GRGDSP (100 mg/ml) but not inhibited by a control<br>
peptide (the C-terminal region of K296-N314 in OPN) (100 mg/ml) .<br>
Thus, the adhesion is dependent on RGD. As shown in Fig. 1B,<br>
further, the antibody 2K1 at 200 (mg/ml apparently inhibited the<br>
cell adhesion to OPN. As shown in Fig. 1C, still further, the<br>
effect of 2K1 on the inhibition of cell adhesion is comparative<br>
to the effect exerted by mAb53 and is concentration-dependent.<br>
Still further, 2K1 and mAb53 never inhibit the adhesion of TIG-7<br>
cell to vitronectin (VN) or fibronectin (FN).<br>
Fig. 2 depicts the inhibition of the monoclonal<br>
antibodies on the adhesion of nOPN and vitronectin to the<br>
a9-transformed SW480 cell. As shown in Fig. 2A, the adhesion<br>
between 1 [xg/ml vitronectin and the a9-trans formed SW480 cell<br>
was inhibited by 200 [M GRGDSP peptide(RGD), so the adhesion<br>
is dependent on the RGD. The adhesion of the a9-transformed<br>
SW480 cell to 3 u.g/ml nOPN was inhibited by a combination of<br>
200 |oM GRGDSP and an anti-a9pl monoclonal antibody Y9A2 (A. Wang<br>
etal., (1996): Am. J. Respir. CellMol. Biol., 15, 664-672),<br>
so the adhesion is RGD-dependent and RGD-independent. Fig.2B<br>
additionally shows the effect of 2K1 on the adhesion of the<br>
a9-transformed SW480 cell to nOPN and vitronectin. The<br>
adhesion between the a9-transformed SW480 cell and vitronectin<br>
was never inhibited by 2K1, but the adhesion between the SW480<br>
cell and nOPN was inhibited by 2K1. Consequently, it is<br>
indicated that 2K1 retains the potency of inhibiting RGD-<br>
dependent adhesion.<br>
Example 5<br>
Inhibition of OPN-induced monocyte migration via the<br>
monoclonal antibodies:<br>
Cell migration test using the U937 cell was performed by<br>
using a system ChemoTx101-8 (Neuro Probe Inc. ) . The cell was<br>
adjusted to 2 xlO6 cells/ml with D-MEM containing 0.1 % BSA,<br>
which was then applied to the upper layer on a filter (with a<br>
pore size of 8 mm) , while the OPN protein was added to the lower<br>
layer.<br>
The ChemoTx plate was left to stand in the presence of<br>
5 % C02 at 37 °C for 4 hours. After the plate was left to stand,<br>
the filter was fixed with methanol-, and was then stained with<br>
hematoxylin and eosin (H-E) . The number of the cells migrating<br>
into the back face of the filter was counted with a microscope<br>
(magnification x 400) . The test was done in a triplicate manner,<br>
and the mean was used as data. The results are shown in Fig.<br>
3.<br>
Fig. 3a shows cell migration of the U937 cell toward the<br>
CHO/OPN-a, the thrombin-cleaved OPN and the GST-Nhalf at the<br>
concentrations shown. Additionally, Fig. 3b shows inhibition<br>
assays using the individual OPNs at 10 (j,g/ml, in the presence<br>
or absence of 50 pig/ml 2K1, mAb53 or control murine IgG after<br>
antigen-specific purification.<br>
As shown in Figs. 3a and 3b, the CHO/OPN-a, the<br>
thrombin-cleaved OPN and the GST-Nhalf induce the migration of<br>
the human monocyte U937 in a concentration-dependent manner (A) .<br>
The 2K1 antibody apparently inhibits the monocyte migration<br>
induced by the CHO/OPN-a, the thrombin-cleaved OPN and the<br>
GST-Nhalf. On contrast, mAb53 only inhibits the monocyte<br>
migration induced by the full-length OPN (B).<br>
Reference Example 1<br>
OPN and arthritis induction:<br>
In order to elucidate the OPN function in arthritis, an<br>
OPN gene-defective mouse (S. R. Rittling et al., (1998): J. Bone<br>
and Mminer. Res., 13 (7), 1101-1111) was artificially prepared<br>
according to a general method, for comparative experiments with<br>
normal mouse.<br>
An arthritogenic monoclonal antibody cocktail<br>
commercially available as a substance eliciting arthritis<br>
(under the trade name of a cocktail for arthritis,<br>
Arthrogen-CIA® mAb, Arthritogenic mAb cocktail; manufactured<br>
by Iwai Chemical Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.) was administered to<br>
the OPN gene-defective mouse (OPN-/-) and a normal mouse (OPN+/+) ,<br>
individually, according to an instruction manual attached to<br>
the product, for arthritis induction. Then, the severity<br>
thereof was observed. For controls, physiological saline was<br>
dosed to the two types of the mice.<br>
Comparison of the severity of arthritis was made on the<br>
basis of arthritis score according to the following standard<br>
and wrist swelling on day 10 post-dosing. The results are shown<br>
in Figs. 4 and 5.<br>
As apparently shown in Fig. 4, the normal mouse dosed with<br>
the arthritogenic antibody cocktail/lipopolysaccharide<br>
(referred to as "LPS" hereinafter) had an increase of the<br>
arthritis score on day 4 and thereafter, until on day 10, the<br>
score reached maximum (12 or more). Alternatively, the<br>
arthritis score of the OPN gene-defective mouse increased on<br>
day 5 and thereafter, but the score was only 4 or less at maximum.<br>
Additionally, any of the groups dosed with physiological saline<br>
had no increase of the arthritis score.<br>
As shown in Fig. 5, further, wrist swelling is apparently<br>
weak in the OPN gene-defective mouse, compared with the normal<br>
mouse, which clearly indicates OPN involvement in arthritis.<br>
Example 6<br>
Inhibitory activity of 2K1 antibody on human peripheral<br>
leukocyte migration:<br>
By the following method, the inhibitory activity of the<br>
2K1 antibody on cytokine-activated human peripheral leukocyte<br>
migration was examined. Table 1 shows the results of the<br>
inhibitory activity on neutrophil migration, while Table 2<br>
shows the results of the inhibitory activity on monocyte<br>
migration.<br>
Experimental method&gt;<br>
At the Ficoll process, a monocyte fraction and a<br>
neutrophil fraction were separated from normal human peripheral<br>
blood (P. M. Daftarian et al., (1996): Journal of Immunology,<br>
157, 12-20) . The intermediate layer between Ficoll and serum<br>
was collected and cultured in a flask at 37 °C for one hour.<br>
The resulting attached cell was used as monocyte. To the<br>
erythrocyte layer remaining after collection of the monocyte<br>
fraction was added a 5-fold volume of 3% dextran-PBS to aggregate<br>
erythrocyte, followed by centrifugation at 150 x g and 4 °C for<br>
5 minutes.<br>
The aggregated erythrocyte was precipitated, while in the<br>
resulting supernatant, neutrophil existed in suspended state.<br>
Then, the fraction was centrifuged at 500 x g and ambient<br>
temperature for 20 minutes, to recover neutrophil. The<br>
monocyte and neutrophil as recovered in such manner were<br>
cultured overnight with human TNF-a (20 ng/mL) for activation.<br>
Then, the resulting activated monocyte and neutrophil were used<br>
for migration experiments.<br>
The migration experiments were done, using a 48-well<br>
micro chemotaxis chamber (manufactured by Neuro Probe Inc.).<br>
After various concentrations of the 2K1 antibody were added to<br>
the thrombin-cleaved OPN and were then preliminarily left to<br>
stand at 37 °C for 15 minutes, the mixtures were added to the<br>
lower chamber (to a final human OPN concentration of 10 mg/mL) .<br>
Placing thereon a polycarbonate filter (pore size of 5 mm),<br>
further, a cell suspension of 50 mL was added to the upper chamber<br>
(2 x 106 cells/mL) .<br>
After culturing in the presence of 5 % C02 at 37 °C for<br>
the isoforms a and b, recombination into pGEX4T vector enabled<br>
the preparation of a GST protein (referred to as "GST-Chalf"<br>
hereinafter).<br><br>
Various recombinant GST-OPN fusion proteins were<br>
prepared in Escherichia coli by a general method, and were then<br>
purified, using a glutathione-Sepharose column according to the<br>
method described in the reference. Among them, the GST-Nhalf<br>
protein was cleaved at the binding site with a prescission<br>
protease (PreScission; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Tokyo,<br>
Japan) , to eliminate the GST protein moiety and thereby recover<br>
a protein (referred to as "nOPN" hereinafter) composed of the<br>
amino-terminal half moiety (I17-R168) of OPN alone.<br>
Alternatively, the cDNA encoding the full-length OPN-<br>
a (M1-N314) was further inserted in pcDNA3.1 (+) vector<br>
(Invitrogen Corporation), for transfection into CHO-K1 cell<br>
(manufactured by Dainippon Pharmaceutical Co ., Ltd.) (referred<br>
to as "CHO/OPN-a cell" hereinafter). The OPN-a of the sugar<br>
chain-bound type (referred to as "CHO/OPN-a" hereinafter) as<br>
recovered from the cell was purified as follows . Specifically,<br>
2 hours, the polycarbonate filter was removed to discard the<br>
cells on the upper surface of the filter; subsequently, the cells<br>
infiltrating into the back face of the filter were stained with<br>
Diff-Quick (manufactured by Baxter, International Inc.). The<br>
stained cells were counted at a magnification x 40. The results<br>
are shown as mean cell counts (cells/mm3) + SD in 6 wells.<br>
Experimental Results&gt;<br>
The 2K1 antibody inhibited the migration of the TNF-<br>
a-activated human peripheral neutrophil and monocyte toward the<br>
thrombin-cleaved OPN.<br>

Example 7<br>
Preparation of M5 antibody:<br>
The following synthetic peptide corresponding to the<br>
inner sequence (C+V138 to R153) of murine OPN was prepared for<br>
use in immunization.<br>
M5 peptide:<br>
CVDVPNGRGDSLAYGLR<br>
The peptide was bound to thyroglobulin, for subsequent<br>
use for rabbit immunization according to a general method.<br>
Anti-serum was collected from the immunized rabbit, to prepare<br>
the M5 antibody, using a column packed with the M5 peptide of<br>
the N terminal cysteine bound through disulfide bond to thiol<br>
Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Tokyo, Japan).<br>
Example 8<br>
Reactivity of the M5 antibody with OPN and the thrombin<br>
digestion products thereof:<br>
The binding potency of the M5 antibody recovered in<br>
Example 7 with OPN and the thrombin digestion products thereof<br>
was tested by the Western blotting method. Recombinant murine<br>
OPN of the glycosylated form as generated in CHO cells was used<br>
as the OPN. The M5 antibody reacted with OPN and the thrombin<br>
digestion products thereof.<br>
Example 9<br>
Inhibition of cell adhesion to OPN via the M5 antibody:<br>
It was examined by the method described in the reference<br>
(S. Konetal., (2002): J. Cell. Biochem., 84(2), 420-432) as<br>
to whether or not the M5 antibody might inhibit cell adhesion<br>
to OPN. As the OPN, the full-length murine OPN was used, from<br>
which the GST moiety had preliminarily been removed with<br>
PreScission protease (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Tokyo,<br>
Japan) (referred to as "mOPN/de-GST" hereinafter) was used. As<br>
the cell, murine NIH3T3 cell was used.<br>
As shown in Fig. 6, the NIH3T3 cell adheres to mOPN/de-GST<br>
in a concentration-dependent manner. As shown in Fig. 7,<br>
further, the adhesion is apparently inhibited by the peptide<br>
GRGDSP (100 (xg/mL) , so the adhesion depends on RGD. As shown<br>
in Fig. 8, the M5 antibody at 200 u.g/mL apparently inhibited<br>
cell adhesion to OPN.<br>
Example 10<br>
Inhibitory activity of the M5 antibody against murine<br>
spleen-derived monocyte migration:<br>
The inhibitory activity of the M5 antibody against<br>
cytokine-adtivated murine spleen-derived monocyte migration-<br>
was examined by the following method. The results are shown<br>
in Table 3.<br>
Experimental method&gt;<br>
The splenocyte from C57BL/6 mouse was ground with a slide<br>
glass into a single cell, which was then cultured in a flask<br>
at 37 °C for one hour. The resulting adherent cell was used<br>
as monocyte . The monocyte was overnight cultured and activated<br>
with human TNF-oc (20 ng/mL) . The resulting activated monocyte<br>
was used at a migration experiment. The migration experiment<br>
was done by the same method as for the human sample in Example<br>
6 above.<br>
Experimental results&gt;<br>
The M5 antibody inhibited the migration of TNF-a-<br>
activated monocyte derived from murine spleen toward the<br>
thrombin-cleavage-type murine OPN recovered from cleavage of<br>
the full-length murine OPN (manufactured by Genzyme<br>
Corporation) with bovine thrombin (manufactured by Sigma).<br>
Example 11<br>
Action of the M5 antibody on bone damage suppression:<br>
By the following method, the action of the M5 antibody<br>
on bone damage suppression in a murine calvaria organ culture<br>
system was examined. The results are shown in Table 4.<br>
Experimental method&gt;<br>
From a newborn mouse on day 1 after birth was resected<br>
the cranial bone; after size adjustment, a half thereof was<br>
placed in each well of a 24-well plate. To each well was then<br>
added human parathyroid hormone (PTH) (1-34) adjusted with<br>
addition of a D-MEM culture broth (with 10 % bovine serum added)<br>
to a final PTH concentration of 10 nM, to induce bone damage.<br>
The M5 antibody was added to a final concentration of 200 |ig/mL.<br>
After culturing at 37 °C for one week, the quantity of calcium<br>
released from bone into the culture broth was assayed by Calcium<br>
E Test WAKO (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd.).<br>
Experimental results&gt;<br>
With no PTH addition, calcium was at a value of 7.02 mg/mL.<br>
With PTH addition, however, calcium was at a value of 9 .11 mg/mL .<br>
Hence, it was indicated that calcium release from bone was<br>
promoted. When the M5 antibody was added at a concentration<br>
of 200 |j,g/mL, it was verified that bone absorption was inhibited<br>
by about 7 0 %.<br>

Example 12<br>
Effect of M5 antibody in mouse collagen arthritis model:<br>
By the following method, the effect of the M5 antibody<br>
in a mouse collagen arthritis model was examined. Table 5 shows<br>
the results about arthritis score; Table 6 shows the results<br>
about leg edema; Table 7 shows the results about body weight<br>
change; and Table 8 shows the results about the change of feed<br>
Experimental method&gt;<br>
For arthritis induction, an arthritogenic antibody<br>
cocktail (under the trade name of a cocktail for arthritis,<br>
Arthrogen-CIA® mAb, Arthritogenic mAb cocktail; manufactured<br>
by Iwai Chemical Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.) recognizing four<br>
epitopes specific to collagen was used.- To a mouse was<br>
intravenously administered the arthritogenic cocktail; 3 days<br>
later, LPS (100 |ag) was intraperitoneally administered to<br>
thereby elicit arthritis . Arthritis was observed on day 3 after<br>
LPS dosing, which reached maximum on day 6.<br>
Immediately before LPS dosing and 3 days later, the M5<br>
antibdy was intravenously administered at a dose of 40 u.g, 150<br>
(j,g or 400 \xq. As the control group, a rabbit IgG-dosed group<br>
(at a dose of 400 \xq) was arranged. Additionally, the<br>
anti-mouse TNF-cx antibody was intravenously administered at a<br>
dose of 200 |ag/mouse immediately before LPS administration and<br>
3 days later. As the control group, a rat IgG-dosed group (at<br>
a dose of 200 ug) was arranged. Further, MTX was orally given<br>
(at a dose of 3.2 mg/kg) once daily on the very day of LPS dosing<br>
and thereafter. Then, MTX dissolved in 5 ml of 0.5 % methyl<br>
cellulose solution was used. For the control group, 5 ml of<br>
0.5 % methyl cellulose solution was arranged.<br>
Assessment was done per one group of five animals,<br>
concerning four items, namely arthritis score, leg edema, body<br>
weight change and feed intake.<br>
Experimental results&gt;<br>
As shown in Tables 5 to 8, the M5 antibody exerted distinct<br>
suppressive actions on the improvement of arthritis score, the<br>
delay of the onset of arthritis, and the improvement of leg edema<br>
in the mouse arthritis model (therapeutic effect) .• The onset<br>
of arthritis was suppressed in a concentration-dependent manner<br>
at a level such that the effect exceeded the effect of the<br>
anti-mouse TNF-a antibody dosed (at a dose of 200 u.g/mouse) .<br>
In contrast, MTX exerted almost no pharmaceutical efficacy.<br>
In the normal group of the model, furthermore, distinct<br>
body weight decrease by about 3 g was observed in 3 days after<br>
LPS dosing; and the tendency was continued on day 3 to day 6,<br>
although the decrease ratio was more or less reduced. In the<br>
groups dosed with the M5 antibody (150 |j.g, 400 ug) and the group<br>
dosed with the anti-mouse TNF-a antibody, alternatively,<br>
apparent improvement of body weight decrease was observed.<br>
Concerning the feed intake, furthermore, rapid body weight<br>
decrease was observed for any of the pharmaceutical substances<br>
up to day 3 after LPS dosing; on day 3 to day 6, however, the<br>
decrease was improved in the groups dosed with the M5 antibody<br>
and the group dosed with the anti-mouse TNF-a antibody. Table<br>
5 shows the effect on arthritis score; Table 6, the suppressive<br>
effect on leg edema; and Tables 7 and 8 show the effects on body<br>
weight change and feed intake change, respectively.<br>

Availability of OPN-related fragment peptides:<br>
OPN-related fragment peptides at a state purified by HPLC<br>
chromatography were purchased from Auspep Inc., Parkiville,<br>
Australia. The amino acid sequences thereof are shown in (1)<br>
to (3) .<br>
hOPN5:<br>
Example 14<br>
Preparation of antigens for immunization: •<br>
Products of the OPN-related fragment peptides bound to<br>
thyroglobulin were prepared by the EMCS (N-(6-<br>
maleimidocaproyloxy)-succinimide) process, as follows. For<br>
preparation of such products, the molar ratio of thyroglobulin,<br>
an OPN-related fragment peptide and EMCS was 1:300:400.<br>
4 mg of each of the OPN-related fragment peptides in<br>
Example 13 was dissolved in distilled water of about 1 ml.<br>
Alternatively, 5 mg thyroglobulin dissolved in 1 ml of 0.01 M<br>
phosphate buffer, pH 7.0 and EMCS dissolved at 30 |ng/ul in<br>
dimethylformamide were mixed together, individually at<br>
quantities corresponding to the moles, to prepare a<br>
thyroglobulin-EMCS complex solution. The complex solution was<br>
divided in three portions. To each of the portions was added<br>
the OPN-related fragment peptide solution at a quantity<br>
corresponding to the mole, to thereby prepare a solution of an<br>
EMCS-crosslinked product of the OPN-related fragment peptide<br>
bound to thyroglobulin.<br>
The solution of such bound product was dialyzed, using<br>
PBS, to adjust the concentration of the product to 10 (xg/fxl.<br>
The bound product of the OPN-related fragment peptide and<br>
thyroglobulin was used as an antigen for immunization.<br>
Example 15<br>
Preparation of antigens for screening:<br>
As OPN proteins for screening, fusion proteins between<br>
GST and human OPN isoforms, namely GST-OPN-a, GST-OPN-b and<br>
GST-OPN-c, and fusion proteins between GST and the OPN fragment<br>
on the side of amino group (GST-Nhalf) from the thrombin cleavage<br>
site and the OPN fragment on the side of carboxyl group<br>
(GST-Chalf) from the same thrombin cleavage site were prepared<br>
by the method described in Example 1, for use in the anti-serum<br>
reactivity with OPN.<br>
Example 16<br>
Immune sensitization:<br>
Rabbit was immunized, using as antigens for immunization,<br>
the bound products of the OPN-related fragment peptides and<br>
thyroglobulin prepared in Example 14. Immunization was done,<br>
by boosting 100 |il (100 u.g) of a bound product solution every<br>
one week or every two weeks. The antigens were mixed with the<br>
Freund complete adjuvant for a first immunization and were then<br>
mixed with the Freund incomplete adjuvant for a second<br>
immunization and the following immunizations. After eight<br>
times of immunization, serum was separated from collectedblood,<br>
which was then used as anti-serum.<br>
Example 17<br>
Reactivity of anti-serum with OPN:<br>
The OPN-related fragment peptides prepared in Example 13<br>
were diluted with 0.1 M carbonate buffer, pH 9.5 to 10 (xg/ml,<br>
which were then immobilized at 50 |il/well on a 96-well plate.<br>
After rinsing with PBS and blocking with 0.1 % BSA/PBS/0.05 %<br>
NaN3 solution, a 2-fold serial dilution of the 100-fold dilution<br>
of the anti-serum recovered in Example 16 was placed at 50 ml<br>
in a well, for reaction at 37 °C for 30 minutes.<br>
After termination of the reaction, the well was rinsed<br>
four times with 0.05 % Tween 20-PBS. Then, 50 ml each of<br>
HRP-labeled anti-rabbit IgG (manufactured by IBL Co ., Ltd.) was<br>
added to each well, for reaction at 37 °C for 30 minutes. After<br>
termination of the reaction, 100 |ul each of 0. 05M citrate buffer,<br>
pH 4.5 containing 0.4 mg/ml orthophenylenediamine (OPD) and<br>
aqueous 0.03 % hydrogen peroxide was added to each well. Then,<br>
the plate was left to stand in darkness at ambient temperature<br>
for 15 minutes, for chromogenic reaction.  After the<br>
chromogenic reaction, 100 ml of 1N sulfuric acid was added to<br>
each well, to terminate the reaction, for absorbance<br>
measurement at 492 nm.<br>
Using the OPN proteins prepared in Example 15,<br>
alternatively, the reactivity of anti-serum was examined by<br>
Western blotting method. Consequently, anti-sera against the<br>
OPN-related fragment peptides hOPNl and hOPN5 reacted with<br>
GST-OPN-a, GST-OPN-b, GST-OPN-c and GST-Nhalf, but never<br>
reacted with GST-Chalf. Alternatively, anti-serum against the<br>
OPN-related fragment peptide hOPN3 reacted with GST-OPN-a,<br>
GST-OPN-b, GST-OPN-c and GST-Chalf, but never reacted with<br>
GST-Nhalf.<br>
Example 18<br>
Preparation of HRP-bound products of anti-OPN-related fragment<br>
peptides antibodies:<br>
HRP-bound products of the antibodies against the OPN-<br>
related fragment peptides hOPN3 and hOPNl were prepared as<br>
follows. 20 mg of each anti-OPN-related fragment peptide<br>
antibody was digested with pepsin, followed by gel filtration<br>
to purify the F(ab')2 fragment of the anti-OPN-related fragment<br>
peptide antibody. Then, the F (ab') 2 fragment was reduced to Fab'<br>
fragment, by using 2-mercaptoethanol. HRP reacted with EMCS<br>
at 37 °C for 60 minutes, followed by gel filtration to prepare<br>
a HRP-EMCS bound product, which further reacted with the<br>
anti-OPN-related fragment peptide antibody Fab' fragment at 4<br>
°C overnight, followed by gel filtration tc prepare an<br>
EMCS-crosslinked HRP-bound product of the anti-OPN-related<br>
fragment peptide antibody.<br>
Example 19<br>
Construction of sandwich ELISA systems:<br>
From combinations of a sandwich ELISA plate and labeled<br>
antibodies, two types of systems namely 1-3 and 5-1 were prepared.<br>
Specifically, the 1-3 system was prepared as follows. The 10<br>
mg/ml antibody against the OPN-related fragment peptide hOPNl<br>
was added in 100 ml portions to a 96-well ELISA plate. After<br>
overnight reaction at 4 °C, blocking with 10 % BSA/PBS/NaN3<br>
solution was done. The resulting plate at that state was used<br>
as the sandwich ELISA plate. The HRP-bound product of the<br>
antibody against the OPN-related fragment peptide hOPN3<br>
prepared in Example 18 was defined as labeled antibody. As<br>
described above, a combination between the immobilizing plate<br>
using the antibody against hOPNl and the labeled antibody using<br>
the antibody against hOPN3 was defined as system 1-3.<br>
In the same manner, a combination of an immobilizing plate<br>
using the antibody against hOPN5 and a labeled antibody using<br>
the antibody against hOPNl was constructed as system 5-1.<br>
Example 2 0<br>
Osteopontin assay in a test subject by sandwich ELISA<br>
systems:<br>
The OPN protein was assayed as follows. 100 [4,1 of a<br>
solution containing a plasma sample or an articular cavity fluid<br>
sample from a test subject was added to the sandwich ELISAplates<br>
of the systems 1-3 and 5-1, for reaction at 37 °C for one hour.<br>
After reaction, the plates were rinsed four times with 0.05 %<br>
Tween20-PBS, followed by addition of 100 ml each of the labeled<br>
antibodies specific to the individual systems for reaction at<br>
4 °C for 30 minutes. After reaction, the plates were rinsed<br>
six times-with 0.05 % Tween20-PBS, followed by addition of 100<br>
ml of a TMB (tetramethylbenzidine) solution. Then, the<br>
resulting plates were left to stand in darkness at ambient<br>
temperature for 30 minutes. IN sulfuric acid was used to<br>
terminate the reaction, for the assay of the absorbance at 450<br>
nm.<br>
Table 9 shows the OPN values in the articular cavity fluids<br>
of patients (13 cases) with rheumatism as measured by the method;<br>
and Table 10 shows the OPN values in the articular cavity fluids<br>
of patients (12 cases) with osteoarthritis. Additionally,<br>
Table 11 shows the OPN values in the plasmas from rheumatism<br>
patients (16 cases) ; Table 12 shows the OPN values in the plasmas<br>
from osteoarthritis patients (7 cases); and Table 13 shows the<br>
OPN values in the plasmas from normal subjects (6 cases).<br>
As apparently shown in these results, the comparison with<br>
the system 1-3 in terms of plasma OPN value among the patients<br>
with rheumatoid arthritis, the patients with osteoarthritis,<br>
and the normal subjects did not show any significant difference.<br>
However, the comparison with the system 5-1 in terms of plasma<br>
OPN value among the patients with rheumatoid arthritis, the<br>
patients with osteoarthritis, and the normal subjects showed<br>
significantly higher plasma OPN values in the patients with<br>
rheumatoid arthritis and the patients with osteoarthritis than<br>
the OPN value in the normal subjects. The level of significance<br>
was higher in the patients with rheumatoid arthritis. This<br>
indicates that total OPN quantity reflected with the system 5-1<br>
is effective for the diagnosis of the general category of<br>
arthritis.<br>
Alternatively, OPN values in the articular cavity fluids<br>
of the patients with rheumatoid arthritis and the patients with<br>
osteoarthritis are larger than the OPN values in the plasmas<br>
thereof, which strongly indicates local OPN generation.<br>
Additionally, the comparison with the systems 1-3 and 5-1<br>
in terms of OPN value of articular cavity fluid between the<br>
patients with rheumatoid arthritis and the patients with<br>
osteoarthritis showed that the OPN value in the patients with<br>
rheumatoid arthritis was significantly larger than the OPN<br>
value in the patients with osteoarthritis, when any of the<br>
systems 1-3 and 5-1 was used.<br>
As a new indicator, the ratio of OPN values with the<br>
systems 1-3 and 5-1 was examined. The indicator can be used<br>
for the comparison of the ratio of the thrombin-cleaved OPN.<br>
The OPN values in the plasmas and articular cavity fluids from<br>
rheumatoid arthritis patients were 1 or less, and the OPN values<br>
from osteoarthritis patients were 2 or more, so significant<br>
difference was observed. Thus, the OPN values with the systems<br>
1-3/5-1 can be used for a diagnostic method for discriminating<br>
rheumatoid patients from osteoarthritis patients at an early<br>
stage.<br>

sequence SVVYGLR or a corresponding equivalent sequence and a<br>
thrombin-cleaved N-terminal fragment of osteopontin, wherein said<br>
anti-osteopontin antibody is an antibody raised against the<br>
peptide CVDTYDGRGDSVVYGLRS or CVDVPNGRGDSLAYGLR as the antigen or<br>
a humanized antibody made by humanization of an antibody which is<br>
raised against the peptide CVDTYDGRGDSVVYGLRS or CVDVPNGRGDSLAYGLR<br>
as the antigen.<br>
2.   The therapeutic agent for treating rheumatoid arthritis as<br>
claimed in claim 1, wherein said anti-osteopontin antibody can<br>
inhibit the binding between an a9b1 integrin and a thrombin-<br>
cleaved N-terminal fragment of osteopontin.<br>
3.   The therapeutic agent for treating rheumatoid arthritis as<br>
claimed in claim 1, wherein said anti-osteopontin antibody can<br>
inhibit the binding between an a4 integrin and a thrombin-cleaved<br>
N-terminal fragment of osteopontin.<br>
4.   The therapeutic agent for treating rheumatoid arthritis as<br>
claimed in claim 1, wherein said anti-osteopontin antibody can<br>
inhibit the binding between an a9b1 integrin and a thrombin-<br>
cleaved N-terminal fragment of osteopontin and the binding between<br>
an a4 integrin and a thrombin-cleaved N-terminal fragment of<br>
osteopontin.<br>
5.   The therapeutic agent for treating rheumatoid arthritis as<br>
claimed in anyone of claims 1 to 4, wherein said anti-osteopontin<br>
antibody is a monoclonal antibody.<br>
6.   The therapeutic agent for treating rheumatoid arthritis as<br>
claimed in anyone of claims 1 to 4, wherein said anti-osteopontin<br>
antibody is a human type antibody.<br>
There is disclosed a therapeutic agent for treating rheumatoid arthritis, comprising, as an active ingredient, an anti-osteopontin antibody which can inhibit the binding between an integrin recognizing the site of the amino acid sequence RGD and a thrombin-cleaved N-terminal fragment of osteopontin, and which can also inhibit the binding between an integrin recognizing the site of the amino acid sequence SVVYGLR or a corresponding equivalent sequence and a thrombin-cleaved N-terminal fragment of osteopontin, wherein said anti-osteopontin antibody is an antibody raised against the peptide CVDTYDGRGDSVVYGLRS or CVDVPNGRGDSLAYGLR as the antigen or a humanized antibody made by humanization of an antibody which is raised against the peptide CVDTYDGRGDSVVYGLRS or CVDVPNGRGDSLAYGLR as the antigen.</td>
