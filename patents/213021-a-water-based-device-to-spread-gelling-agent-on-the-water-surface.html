				<td>Title of the Invention;<br>
A water based device, to spread gelling agent on the water surface.<br>
Field of the Invention;<br>
The present invention relates to a water based device to spread gel on the water surface which may or may not be contaminated with the flammable products, such as petrol, oil, lubricants etc or oils in general.<br>
PRIOR ART<br>
The oil slicks or hydrocarbon slicks floating on open water surface, whether resulted from subsea well blowouts or shipping mishaps, are highly undesirable for the marine environment. With the increasing number of subsea exploratory, production oil wells, increasing volume of shipping traffic relying on progressively larger tankers contaminate water surface in sea etc. with the petrol or oil or lubricant or hydrocarbon fuel etc. is more likely. This contamination of water surface with petrol or oil or lubricant or hydrocarbon fuel, which are referred herein after as POL products or as flammable products and which inturn are floating on the water surface, is referred<br>
hydrocarbon slicks or oil slicks, and the floating flammable products or POL products on the water surface, as referred herein above, are referred as hydrocarbon slicks or oil slicks herein after.<br>
The hydrocarbon or oil slicks, as referred herein above, not only contaminate the water surface but also raises the risk of sudden fire and under such circumstances of sudden fire of hydrocarbon or oil slicks, the POL, products or flammable products, as referred herein above, after catching the fire spreads further on the water surface, particularly in the open water surface, such as in sea etc, and hence, increases the probability of accidents and casualities.<br>
Therefore, the direct destruction of the hydrocarbon slicks or oil slicks has to be avoided.<br>
The conventional method is to convert the slicks, as referred herein above, into the gel and then to ignite the gel to destroy the POL products or flammable products.<br>
The conventional methods known in the art employ the manual spreading of conventional gelling agents over the water surface contaminated with hydrocarbon or oil slicks. The slicks, as referred herein, forms the gel when come in contact with gelling agent. Once the gel is formed, the gel may be ignited directly to destroy the POL products or flammable products or gel is removed manually from the water surface. The latter step, i.e. manual removal of gel is highly time consuming and cumbersome, more so in case, if the gel is spreaded onto the wider area.<br>
The another drawbacks of conventional methods is that the manual spreading of gelling agent is also time consuming and cumbersome, also calls for the human being to go into the canal or sea and hence exposing oneself to the hazardous environment, and in addition the gelling agent may not be spreaded over the entire slick and further in addition the gelling agent may not be spreaded uniformily.<br>
Still another drawbacks of the conventional methods are that, the conventional gelling agents which are generally 'gel-hydrocarbon fuel', do not result in uniform formation of gel and in addition have the short life. Further, the time required for gelling, that is, convertion of hydrocarbon slicks or oil slicks into gel, is highly time consuming.<br><br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
A primary object of the present invention is to propose a device which can conveniently spread a gelling agent on a water surface contaminated with hydrocarbon slicks or oil slicks.<br>
Another  object    of  this  invention  is<br>
to propose water based device which first spreads the gelling agent or the instant gel on a water surface contaminated with petrol or hydrocarbon slicks or oil slicks/ and the said slicks are converted into gel layer instantly on coming in contact with the gelling agent or instant gel so as to overcome the disadvantage of the conventional methods.<br>
A further object of the present invention is to propose a gelling agent which can instantly form a uniform gel layer with oil slicks or hydrocarbon slicks floating on the water surface.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to propose a water based device which can be employed under the water surface as well.<br>
Yet another object of this invention is to propose a water based device to spread a gelling agent, on a water surface contaminated with the oil slicks floating on the water surface, which can be employed under the water level and as well as be operated from ground level or remotely from the distance.<br>

To this canister (1) filled with gelling agent and fitted with tube (7), as described herein above, an anchor sack, not shown in the figure, is tied with the help of a rope and the device is deployed under the water.<br><br>
(Construction)<br>
The canister body (2) is fitted with the gelling agent and the tube (7), which in-turn comprises of a bottle (11), a cap (19), internal lid (18), heating means (17) and a cable (22) and constructed as above, is placed in the canister body (2) by passing it (tube) (7) through the canister neck (4). The cap (19) fitted on the tube (7) fits into the canister neck (4) so that the part 20 of the cap (19) sits firmly on the canister neck (4). The cable (22) is passed through the hole provided in the canister lid (6). The canister lid (6) is completely tightened and sealed preferably with m-seal. To this canister (1), an anchor sack, preferably the HDPE cloth sack containing 10-12 kg stones or bricks etc is tied preferably with the help of a polypropylene rope. The whole device comprising of canister (1), canister body (2) fitted with the gelling agent and the tube (7), which in-turn comprises of a bottle (11), a cap (19), internal lid (18), heating means (17) and a cable (22) and constructed as above, and of anchor sack, as stated above, is deployed under water about 10-15 cm below the water level. The cable's part (15) connecting the two ce pellets with each other and then to the main cable (22), the terminals of which are then connected to the any known firing device.<br>
The gelling, in accordance to the preferred embodiment, is fast gelling agent for hydrocarbon fuels and is a mixture of aluminium soap of mixed fatty acids, precipitated on finely divided natural rubber particles. The rubber particles embedded by aluminium soap is further mixed with powdered talc (fine grade) and powdered alpha naphthol.<br>
The composition of the gelling agent in accordance to the preferred embodiment of the present invention is:<br>
i)	Aluminium soap, 74-79% by weight<br>
ii)	Natural rubber, 9-13% by weight<br>
iii)	Alpha-Naphthol, 6.5-10.5% by weight<br>
iv)	Talc,	2.0-3.2% by weight<br>
The gelling agent in accordance to the preferred embodiment of the present invention, is prepared as described herein below.<br>
The mixture of oils is first saponified using concentrated caustic soda solution. Sodium soap thus formed is then dissolved in water and solution is agitated by a stirrer. While maintaining the desired temperature, calculated dilute rubber latex solution is added followed by the addition of aluminium sulphate solution in a thin stream. This results in the precipitation of aluminium soap on rubber particles. The aluminium soap thus formed is filtered, washed with water to remove the impurities and granulated by a special technique. The granulated soap is now dried, mixed with anti-agglomerant (talc) and then with alpha naphthol powder. The resulted gelling agent is passed through 1200-1222 micrometer sieve. The gelling agent obtained definitely offers an advantage of optimum performance.<br>
In accordance to the preferred embodiment of this invention the gelling agent filled in the canister (1) and is spreaded on the water surface having floating petrol, hydrocarbon slicks or oil slicks, as stated herein above, by passing the electric impulse through the cable to the heating means which in-turn initiates the exothermic reaction resulting in sudden increase in temperature and release of gases, which results in increase of pressure and as a result the canister is completely broken. As a result the gelling agent or/instant gelling agent, as referred herein above, is spreaded all over the water surface contaminated with oil slicks etc.<br>
In accordance to the advantage of the device and the gelling agent of the present invention, when the instant<br>
gelling agent come in contact with the petrol, hydrocarbon slicks or oil slicks, as stated herein above, floating on the water surface, the gel layer is formed within 25-30 minutes. The floating petrol, hydrocarbon slicks or oil slicks on the water surface is thus converted into a gel layer. This conversion of slicks into gel layer definitely results in the advantage that the continuty of the petrol, hydrocarbon slicks or oil slicks is disturbed because of contraction of the slicks into the gel layer and accordingly, only desired spot of the petrol/oil slicks are required to be removed mannually or are required to be destroyed by burning thus avoiding the disadvantages of direct burning of the hydrocarbon slicks or oil slicks, as described herein above.<br>
The present invention makes the disclosure of the means to destroy the gel layer formed on the water surface, contaminated with the petrol, hydrocarbon slicks or oil slicks, as a result of process and device described herein above. In order to destroy the slicks by burning the bottle (11) is filled with sodium metal taken in kerosene oil. The sodium metal is released along with the gelling agent on breaking of the canister. This released sodium metal pieces, come into contact with water and create flame which is transmitted to the gel layer, which in turn catches the fire immediately and thus gel layer is destroyed.<br>
The present invention is described by the following example to demonstrate the function of the device disclosed in the present invention. Thus example is not intended to limit the scope of the present invention.<br>
The gelling agents known in the prior art can also be used with the presently disclosed invention. The use of the presently disclosed device with the gelling agent, as disclosed herein below, or with the gelling agent, as known in the prior art may fall within the scope of this invention.<br>
The present invention has been explained to demonstrate one of the end use, that is, to spread the gelling agent on the water surface contaminated with oil slicks etc. however, the presently disclosed device can also be used to spread any chemical powder or mixture on the water surface of any source, i.e. sea, canal, river etc. whether contaminated with any material or product or not.<br>
Example<br>
A HOPE canister (cap.5 liter) is filled with 1.8 kg instant gelling agent<br>
(passing 1204 micrometer sieve) and the tube with internal lid and comprising of bottle and heating means (10 g ce pellets) along with electric cable and its part connecting the two ce pellets, as described herein above, is placed into the canister. The terminals of the cable are taken out through the internal lid of tube and the canister lid of the canister. The canister lid is completely tightened and sealed with m-seal. To this canister, an anchor sack (HOPE cloth sack) containing approx 10-12 kg stones/bricks is tied with the help of a polypropylene rope and the whole assembly is deployed under water (10-12 cm below water level). The cable terminals are connected to an initiating device. Now, about 25 liter petrol is spreaded on the water surface to make a petrol slick.<br>
The instant gelling agent from the canister is spreaded on the water surface with floating petrol on its surface. An electric impulse is given to electric cable which initiates the heating means, resulting in spontaneous exothermic reaction and the canister is completely broken. As a result the instant gelling agent is spreaded all over the water surface, when the instant gelling agent and petrol layer floating on water surface come in contact with each other, the gel layer is formed within 25-30 minutes. The petrol layer floating on water surface is thus converted into a gel layer, which in turn results in contraction of area of petrol layer.<br><br><br><br>
