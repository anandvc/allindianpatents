Peroxisome Proliferator Activated Receptors PPAR  are memDers or me nuciear hormone receptor super family, which are ligand-activated transcription factors regulating gene expression. Various subtypes thereof have been identified and cloned. These include PPARce, PPAR|3 (also known as PPARS), and PPARy. There exist at least two major isoforms of PPARy. While PPARy 1 is ubiquitously expressed in most tissues, the longer isoform PPARy2 is almost exclusively found in adipocytes. In contrast, PPARa is predominantly expressed in the liver, kidney and heart PPAR's modulate a variety of body responses including glucose- and lipid- homeostasis, cell differentiation, inflammatory responses and cardiovascular events.<br>
Diabetes is a disease in which a patient's ability to control glucose levels in blood is impaired, because he has partially lost the ability to respond properly to the action of insulin. In type II diabetes (T2D), often referred to as non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), which afflicts 80-90 % of all diabetic patients in developed countries, the Isles of Langerhans in the pancreas still produce insulin. However, the target organs, mainly muscle, liver and adipose tissue, exhibit a profound resistance to insulin stimulation, and the body compensates by producing unphysiologically high levels of insulin. In later stage of disease, however, insulin secretion decreases due to exhaustion of the pancreas. In addition to that T2D is a metabolic-cardiovascular disease syndrome. Among the comorbidities associated with T2D are for example insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, hypertension, endothelial dysfunction and inflammatory atherosclerosis.<br>
Current first line treatment for diabetes generally involves low fat - and glucose - diet and exercise. However, compliance can be moderate and as the disease progresses, treatment with hypoglycemic drugs, e.g. sulfonylureas or metformin, becomes necessary. A promising new class of drugs has recently been introduced that resensitizes patients to their own insulin (insulin sensitizers), thereby reverting blood glucose and triglyceride levels to normal, and thus abolishing, or at least reducing, the requirement for exogenous insulin. Pioglitazone (Actos    ) and rosiglitazone (Avandia l ) belong to the thiazolidinediones (TZD) class of PPARy-agonists and were the first representatives who had been approved for NIDDM in several countries. These compounds, however, suffer from side effects including rare but severe liver toxicity (as seen with troglitazone), and they increase body weight in humans. Therefore, new, better and more efficacious drugs for the treatment of NIDDM are urgendy needed. Recent studies provide evidence that a coagonism on PPARot and PPARy would result in compounds with enhanced therapeutic potential, i. e. such compounds should improve the lipid profile in addition to the normalization of glucose- and insulin-levels (Keller and Wahli: Trends Endocrin. Metab. 1993; 4:291-296, Macdonald and Lane: Current Biology Vol.5 pp.618-621 (1995)). Recent observations suggest furthermore that there is an independent PPARa mediated effect on<br><br>
insulin-sensitzation that could result secondary to the reduction in lipids (Guerre-Millo et al; J Biol Chem2000; 275:16638-16642). Consequently, the incorporation of PPARa activity into PPARy agonists is expected to give rise to more efficacious drugs for the treatment and/or prevention of diabetes.<br>
The novel compounds of the present invention exceed the compounds known in the art, inasmuch as they bind to and activate both, PPARa and PPARy, simultaneously and very efficiently. Therefore, these compounds combine the anti-glycemic effect of PPARy activation with the anti-dyslipidemic effect of PPARa activation. Consequently, plasma glucose and insulin are reduced (=insulin sensitization), triglycerides lowered and HDL cholesterol increased (=improved lipid profile). In addition, such compounds may also lower LDL cholesterol, decrease blood pressure and counteract inflammatory atherosclerosis. Since multiple facets of the T2D disease syndrome are addressed by PPARa and y coagonists, they are expected to have an enhanced therapeutic potential compared to the compounds already known in the art.<br>
The compounds of the present invention further exhibit improved pharmacological properties compared to known compounds.<br>

The compounds of formula (I) can be manufactured by the methods given below, by the methods given in the examples or by analogous methods. Appropriate reaction conditions for the individual reaction steps are known to a person skilled in the art. Starting materials are either commercially available or can be prepared by methods analogous to the methods given below, by methods described in references cited in the text or in the examples, or by methods known in the art.<br>
Racemates of compounds of formula (I) [compounds 9 and compounds 10 in scheme 1] can e. g. be synthesized according to the methods depicted in scheme 1 or by analogous methods.<br>
Homochiral compounds of formula (I) (compounds 8 and 9 in scheme 2 and compounds 6 and 7 in scheme 3) can be prepared according to the methods depicted in scheme 2 and 3 or by analogous methods.<br><br><br>
Aldehydes 1 can be reacted with a Wittig salt 2 such as (l,2-diethoxy-2-oxoethyl)triphenyl phosphonium chloride or (l&gt;2-dimethoxy-2-oxoethyl)triphenyl phosphonium bromide in solvents like isopropanol, dichloromethane or tetrahydrofuran or mixtures thereof in the presence of a base like potassium carbonate, l,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene (DBU) or 1,1,3,3-tetramethyl-guanidine, preferably between 0°C and the reflux temperature of the solvents, giving acrylic esters 3 as E and/or Z isomers (step a). Hydrogenation of acrylic esters 3 using palladium on charcoal as catalyst, preferably at room temperature and 1 atm. pressure of hydrogen, in solvents like methanol, ethanol, tetrahydrofuran, acetic acid, dichloromethane and mixtures thereof, affords racemic esters 7, provided that the protecting group can be cleaved reductively (step f). Hydrogenation of compounds in<br><br>
which R -R together with the attached benzene ring form a benzofuran moiety can be performed using extended reaction times to provide the corresponding benzo-dihydrofiiran analogues. In compounds, in which R3-R4 together with the attached benzene ring form a benzothiophene or a benzofuran moiety, the reduction of the double bond is preferably performed with a reducing metal like magnesium in solvent mixtures like tetrahydrofuran / methanol between room temperature and the reflux temperature of the solvents leading to saturated compounds 6 (step e). Subsequently, the protecting group like a benzyl ether is cleaved, e. g. by using dimethyl sulfide and boron trifluoride diethyl etherate in a solvent like dichloromethane between room temperature and the reflux temperature of the solvent to give phenolic compounds 7 (step h).<br>
Alternatively, aldehydes 1 are reacted with the enolate of alkanoic acid esters or alkoxy- or aryloxy-acetic acid esters 4 (preferably the lithium-enolate, prepared at -78°C by treatment of 4 with a strong, non-nucleophilic base like lithium diisopropylamide in an inert solvent like tetrahydrofuran), preferably at temperatures around -78°C, in solvents like tetrahydrofuran giving the aldol product 5 as a mixture of diasteromers (step b). Removal of the benzylic hydroxy group in 5 with a reducing agent like e. g. triethylsilane in the presence of a Lewis acid, like boron-trifluoride, or a protic acid, like trifluoroacetic acid, in a suitable solvent like trifluoroacetic acid itself or dichloromethane between 0°C and 60°C yields racemic esters 6 (step d); ensuing removal of the protecting group, e. g. a benzyloxy function, can then be performed by standard technology, e. g. catalytic hydrogenation using hydrogen and a, catalyst like palladium to give phenolic compounds 7 (step h). Catalytic hydrogenation can also be used to convert in one step benzyl protected hydroxy compounds 5 into phenolic compounds 7 (step g), preferably using palladium on charcoal as catalyst in the presence of an acid like oxalic acid in solvents like alcohols at temperatures around room temperature and a hydrogen pressure up to 100 bar. The cleavage of the protective function can also be performed before the removal of the benzylic hydroxy group; in such a case, similar reaction conditions can be chosen for the removal of the benzylic hydroxy group as just described for the transformation of compounds 5.<br>
As an alternative method, compounds 5 can be treated with catalytic amounts of an acid like para toluene sulfonic acid in a solvent like benzene or toluene, preferably under conditions allowing the removal of the water formed (e. g. with a Dean Stark trap or in the presence of molecular sieves) at temperatures between room temperature and the reflux temperature of the solvents to yield acrylic esters 3 (step c).<br>
Aryl-thiazole compounds 8 (prepared as outlined in schemes 11-14) are condensed with phenols 7 according to well known procedures: if Ru represents a hydroxy group e. g. via Mifstmo&amp;u-reaction, with triphenylphosphine and di-tert-butyl-, diisopropyl- or diethyl-<br><br>
azodicarboxylate as reagents; this transformation is preferably carried out in a solvent like toluene, dichloromethane or tetrahydrofuran at ambient temperature. Alternatively, if RL1 represents a halide, mesylate or tosylate moiety, the aryl-thiazole compounds 8 can be reacted with phenols 7 in solvents like N,N-dimethylformamide, acetonitrile, acetone or methyl-ethyl ketone in the presence of a weak base like cesium or potassium carbonate at a temperature ranging from room temperature to 140°C, preferably around 50°C to yield ether compounds 9 (step i). Those can optionally be hydrolyzed according to standard procedures, e. g. by treatment with an alkali hydroxide like LiOH or NaOH in a polar solvent mixture like tetrahydrofuran/ethanol/water leading to carboxylic acids 10 (step k). If the aryl-thiazole compounds 8 (prepared as described in schemes 11-14) contain chiral centers, ester compounds 9 and carboxylic acids 10 are obtained as mixtures of diastereomers, which can be separated by methods well known in the art, e. g. HPLC chromatography or crystallization.<br><br><br>
Homochiral alpha-substituted-phenyl-propionic acid esters of formula 8 and free acids of formula 9 can be prepared according to the method depicted in scheme 2 or by analogous methods known in the art.<br>
The well known chiral auxiliary 2 [(S)-4-benzyl-oxazolidin-2-one] is condensed with an alkanoyl chloride or an alkoxy- or aryloxy-acetyl chloride 1 in the presence of a strong base like n-butyl lithium in an inert solvent like tetrahydrofuran at temperatures around -78°C to produce building block 3 (step a). The latter is then treated according to literature precedence [Tetrahedron Asymmetry (1999), 10,1353-1367] with dibutylboron-triflate and a tertiary amine like triethylamine in dichloromethane to generate the corresponding<br><br>
boron enolate, which is subsequently reacted at low temperatures with aldehydes 4 resulting in compounds 5 (step b). In compounds 5, one of all four possible stereoisomers is strongly predominating (stereochemistry as indicated without rigorous proof with respect to the benzylic position). Compounds 5 are converted into phenolic intermediates 6 via a three step sequence encompassing: i) carefully controlled ester formation using only a minimal excess of alcoholate in the corresponding alcohol as solvent or in solvents like tetrahydrofiiran or dioxane at temperatures ranging from -20°C to room temperature (step c); ii) reductive removal of the benzylic hydroxy group as described above for the conversion of compounds 5 to compounds 6 in scheme 1 (step d); iii) removal of the protecting group by standard technology (step e); the order of the three reaction steps c, d, e is interchangeable, and the simultaneous removal of the benzyhc hydroxy function and a benzyl protecting group as described for the conversion of compounds 5 to compounds 7 in scheme 1 is also possible. The transformation of phenolic intermediates 6 into ester 8 and / or acids 9 can be performed in perfect analogy as described for racemic phenolic intermediates 7 in scheme 1 (steps f and g). If carefully controlled reaction conditions are applied as detailed in the experimental part, hardly any racemisation occurs during this reaction sequence. The optical purity of compounds 8 and 9 can be determined by chiral HPLC or by ^-NMR-spectroscopy in the presence of a chiral solvent like l-(9-anthryl)-2,2,2-trifluoro-ethanol. If the aryl-thiazole compounds 7 (prepared as described in schemes 11-14) contain chiral centers and are not optically pure, ester compounds 8 and carboxylic acids 9 are obtained as mixtures of diastereomers, which can be separated by methods well known in the art, e. g. HPLC chromatography or crystallization.<br><br><br>
Homochiral alpha-substituted-phenyl-propionic acid esters of formula 6 and free acids of formula 7 can also be prepared according to a linear synthetic sequence depicted in scheme 3. Thus, reaction types already described in scheme 2 are used in a different order beginning with the condensation of aryl-thiazole synthons 1 with phenols 2 affording ether compounds 3 bearing an aldehyde moiety (step a). These ether compounds 3 are then<br><br>
reacted with the chiral synthons (compounds 3 in scheme 2) to form aldol-adducts 4 (step b). Removal of the benzylic hydroxy function in compounds 4 leads to compounds 5 (step c), which can be converted into the corresponding esters 6 (step d) or acids 7 (step e) as described for the analogous reactions in scheme 1 and 2, respectively. Optionally, ester compounds 6 can be hydrolysed to acids 7 (step f). If the aryl-thiazole compounds 1 (prepared as described in schemes 11-14) contain chiral centers and are not optically pure, ester compounds 6 and carboxylic acids 7 are obtained as mixtures of diastereomers, which can be separated by methods well known in the art, e. g. HPLC chromatography or crystallization.<br>
Aldehydes 1 (scheme 1), aldehydes 4 (scheme 2), aldehydes 2 (scheme 3), are known or can be synthesized by methods known in the art. Examples for possible syntheses of these key intermediates are given in schemes 4-10.<br><br>
Known phenols 1 can be transformed into aldehydes 3 either by known formylation reactions such as e. g. the Vilsmeier formylation, by treatment with hexamethylene tetramine under acidic conditions, e. g. in the presence of sulfuric acid or preferably with trifluoroacetic acid as solvent between 0°C and the reflux temperature of trifluoroacetic acid, or by formylation with dichloromethyl methyl ether in the presence of titanium tetrachloride, preferably in dichloromethane at temperatures between -78°C and the reflux temperature of the solvent (step a); alternatively, a two step procedure might be used: introduction of a halogen atom into the para position, e.g. by use of N-bromo- or N-iodo-succinimide, e. g. in a mixture of concentrated sulfuric acid and tetrahydrofuran preferably at ambient temperature, followed by a metal halogen exchange, realized by<br><br>
treatment with an alkyl-lithium reagent like n-butyllithium, preferably at temperatures around -78°C, and quenching the resulting aryl-Li with a formyl transfer reagent like N,N-dimethylformamide or N-formyl-piperidine (steps b and c). Alternatively, a carbonylation reaction can be used for the introduction of the formyl group in step c, e. g. by use of sodium formate, bis(triphenylphosphine) palladium(II) dichloride and CO gas in a solvent like N,N-dimethylformamide, preferably at temperatures around 100°C<br><br>
4-Hydrosy-benzofuran 5 (R6=H)[Synthetic Communications (1986), 16(13), 1635-1640; Helvetica Chimica Acta (1933), 16,121-129] and 4-hydroxy-benzothiophene 9 (R6=H) [Jpn. Kokai Tokkyo Koho (2001), 2001048876A2] are known. Thus, cyclohexane-1,3-diones 1 carrying variable substituents R6 at the 5-position can be reacted with bromo-pyruvic acid in methanol in the presence of a base like potassium hydroxide at temperatures between 0°C and the reflux temperature of methanol followed by treatment with hydrochloric acid at around 100°C to give fiiran-carboxylic acids 3 (step a). Treatment of these furan-carboxylic acids 3 in an inert solvent like decahydro-naphthalene in the presence of a hydrogen acceptor like dodecene and palladium on carbon, preferably at reflux, provides carboxy-benzofurans 4 (step b), which are decarboxylated to<br><br>
benzofurans 5, e. g. by using copper powder in quinoline at temperatures between 200°C and 240°C (step c). Similar to the transformations described in scheme 4, benzofurans 5 can finally be converted into formylated benzofuran intermediates 6 (step d).<br>
Treatment of 2-thiophenecarbaldehyde 7 with suitable vinyl-lithium- or vinyl-magnesium-derivatives in solvents like tetrahydrofuran or 1,2-dimethoxy-ethane, preferably in a temperature range between -78°C and room temperature, followed by in situ treatment with acetic anhydride yields thiophenes 8 with variable substitution R6 (step e). Treatment of thiophenes 8 with carbon monoxide, preferably at a pressure of 20 to 60 bar, a palladium catalyst like palladium acetate, a phosphine like triphenylphosphine, in solvent mixtures which may typically contain acetic anhydride, triethylamine, toluene or tetrahydrofuran, preferably in a temperature range between 100°C to 160°C, affords after saponification of the acetate function benzothiophenes 9 (step f). Similar to the transformations described in scheme 4, benzothiophenes 9 can finally be converted into formylated benzothiophene intermediates 10 (step g).<br><br><br>
2-Hydroxy~3-methoxy-benzddehyde 1, optionally substituted with bromine in position 5, can be transformed into benzo[b]thiophen-7-ol 6 or 5-bromo-benzo[b]thiophen-7-ol 6. This sequence can be carried out in analogy to the method described in J. Chem. Soc, Perkin Trans. 1 1983(12), 2973-7; for the transformation of 2-hydroxy-3-methoxy-benzaldehyde into benzo[b]thiophen-7-ol. It involves the following steps: treatment with N,N-dimethylthiocarbamoyl chloride in a solvent like tetrahydrofiiran in the presence of an aqueous base like potassium hydroxide in water or in the presence of an organic base like diisopropyl-ethyl-amine, preferably at temperatures between 0°C and room temperature, generates thionocarbamates 2 (step a); thermal rearrangement of compounds 2 without solvent or preferably in an inert solvent like diphenyl ether at temperatures between 200°C and 280°C leads to arylthiocarbamates 3 (step b); saponification in a<br><br>
solvent like an alcohol with a base like sodium or potassium hydroxide, preferably between room temperature and the reflux temperature of the solvents, leads then to thiophenols 4 (step c); reaction of these thiophenols 4 with sodium chloroacetate in water or a water / alcohol mixture in the presence of a base like sodium or potassium hydroxide in a temperature range between room temperature and the reflux temperature of the solvents produces then benzothiophene-carboxylic acids 5 (step d); decarboxylation, e. g. in quinoline in the presence of copper bronze at temperatures between 200°C and 240°C, followed by cleavage of the methyl ether function, e. g. by treatment with aqueous hydrobromic acid in acetic acid at reflux, then yields benzo[b]thiophen-7-ols 6 (step e). Similar to the transformations described in scheme 4, benzo[b]thiophen-7-ols 6 can finally be converted into formylatedbenzo[b]thiophen-7-ol intermediates 7 (step f).<br>
7-Hydroxy-benzofiiran is known and commercially available [J. Med. Chem. (1987), 30(1), 62-7]. In a sequence similar to that described above, the 5-bromo-analogue can be prepared from 2-hydroxy-3«methoxy-benzaldehyde 1 by reaction with ethyl chloro-actetate in a solvent like N,N-dimethylformamide in the presence of a base like potassium carbonate at temperatures between 60°C and 120°C yielding benzofuran carboxylic acid 8 (step g). Decarboxylation as described above and ensuing ether cleavage, preferably with pyridine hydrochloride at temperatures around 200°Q then leads to 5-bromo-7-hydroxy-benzofiiran 9 (step h). Similar to the transformations described in scheme 4, 5-bromo-7-hydroxy-benzofuran 9 can finally be converted into formylated 5-bromo-7-hydroxy-benzofuran intermediate 10 (step i).<br><br><br>
l-Hydroxy-4-formyl-naphthalene 1 and 2,3-annelated phenols 2 with a ring size of 5, 6 and 7 are commercially available or known [see J. Am. Chem. Soc. (1988), 110(19), 6471-6480; U.S. (2000) 6121397; PCTInt. Appl. (1999) WO99/10339]. Similar to the transformations described in scheme 4,2,3-annelated phenols 2 can be converted into formylated 2,3-annelated phenols 3 (step a).<br>
3-Bromo-l-hydroxy-naphthalene 5, an intermediate carrying a functionality, which allows synthetic modifications at a later stage, can be prepared from 3-nitxo-l-methoxy-naphthalene 4 [Monatsh. Chem. (1992), 123(6-7), 637-645] by well established procedures, i. e. reduction of the nitro function, e. g. by hydrogenation in the presence of a palladium catalyst, followed by diazotisation, Sandmeyer reaction and cleavage of the<br><br>
methyl ether function giving 3-bromo-l-hydroxy-naphthalene 5 (steps b, c, d). Similar to the transformations described in scheme 4,3-bromo-l-hydroxy-naphthalene 5 can be converted into 3-bromo-4-formyl-l-hydroxy-naphthalene 6 (step e).<br>
2,3-Annelated carboxylic acids 7 are known, their 3-bromo analogues 8 are known or can be prepared by established methods of bromination of aromatic nuclei [J. Org. Chem. (1978), 43(11), 2167-70; Ger. Offen. (1977), DE 2633905] (step f). Such 3-bromo-benzoic acids can then be converted into the corresponding phenols 9 by known methods such as e. g. exhaustive reduction with borane to the corresponding alcohol, oxidation, e. g. using Swern conditions (oxalyl chloride / dimethylsulfoxide / triethylamine in dichloromethane, -78°C to room temperature), to the corresponding aldehyde, followed by Baeyer-Villiger oxidation e. g. with peracetic acid (40%) in acetic acid (steps g, h, i). Similar to the transformations described in scheme 4, phenols 9 can be converted into intermediates 10 (stepk).<br><br><br>
Bromo-methoxy compound 1 characterized by an annelated dihydro-2H-pyran ring is known [Can. J. Chem. (1982), 60(16), 2093-8]. Cleavage of the methoxy ether function with pyridine hydrochloride at temperatures around 200°C leads to 3-bromo-phenol 2 (step a). Similar to the transformations described in scheme 4, compound 2 can be converted into intermediate 3 (step b).<br>
The isomeric building block can be obtained as follows: Carboxylic acid 4 [U.S. (1999), US 5856529 A] can be brominated to give the 3-bromo derivative 5 (step c), which can be transformed into phenol 6 by a sequence analogous to that described for the transformation of compounds 8 into compounds 9 in scheme 7 (steps d, e, f). Similar to the transformations described in scheme 4, phenol 6 can be converted into intermediate 7 (stepg).<br><br>
3-Bromo-phenols 1 (intermediates 6, scheme 6, intermediates 9, scheme 6, intermediates 5, scheme 7, intermediates 9&gt; scheme 7, as well as intermediates 2 and 6, scheme 8), optionally carrying a protective function, can be converted into analogous phenols 2 carrying variable substiutents R6 by first transforming the bromo-compound into the corresponding aryl-lithium derivative (e. g. by using an alkyl lithium reagent in a solvent like tetrahydrofuran, preferably at a temperature around -78°C) and then quenching the latter with a variety of electrophiles using methods well known in the art (step a). For the synthesis of phenols (R6=OH), the aryl lithium compounds 'are reacted with trimethyl-borate at temperatures between -78°C and the reflux temperature of tetrahydrofuran, followed by oxidation e. g. with N-methyl morpholine N-oxide or H2O2 / NaOH, preferably at the reflux temperature of tetrahydrofuran [compare Synlett 1995(09), 931-932]. These phenols 2 with R6 equal OH can then be transformed into the corresponding ether compounds by well known methods. Similar to the reaction sequence described in scheme 4, phenolic compounds 2 can finally be converted into phenolic aldehyde intermediates 3 (step b).<br><br><br>
Phenols 1, optionally carrying a protecting group, can be further transformed into phenols 2 carrying additional substutents R5 by known methods of electrophilic aromatic substitution. In many cases, mixture of ortho / para - substitution-, and ortho / para -disubstitution-products will be formed in ratios depending on the precise reaction conditions. In such cases, the reaction conditions can be optimized in order to achieve the highest possible yield of mono-ortho product; optionally, product mixtures can also be separated into pure isomers by known methods such as silica gel chromatography (step a). 4-Formyl compounds 3 can be obtained from phenols 1, optionally carrying a protecting group, by transformations as described in scheme 4 (step b). 4-Formyl compounds 3 can then again be used as starting materials applying known methods of electrophilic aromatic substitutions leading to compounds 4 carrying an additional R5 substituent (step c). Alternatively, compounds 4 may be obtained from phenols 2 by transformations as described in scheme 4 (step d).<br><br><br>
Thioamides 1 are known or can be prepared by methods known in the art, e. g. by treatment of the corresponding carboxamide with phosphorus pentasulfide or with Lawesson's Reagent [2,4-bis(4-methoxyphenyl)-13"dithia-2&gt;4-diphosphetane-2J4-disulfide] in a solvent like toluene at temperatures preferably between 60°C and the reflux temperature of the solvent. Condensation of thioamides 1 with a suitable bis-electrophile, e. g. methyl 4-bromo- or 4-chloro-3-oxo-alkanoates 2, preferably in a solvent like toluene at elevated temperatures (e. g. at reflux temperature), gives thiazoles 3 carrying an acetic acid ester function at position 4 (step a) [compare PCT Int. Appl (1997), WO97/31907 Al]- 4-Bromo-3-oxo-alkanoates 2 are known or can be prepared by methods known in the art [compare PCT Int. Appl. (2001), WO 01/79202 Al]. Thiazoles 3 can then be reduced, e. g. with lithium aluminum hydride in solvents like in ether or tetrahydrofuran, to thiazoles 5 with R9 = R10 = H (step c). Alternatively, alkyl groups R9 and/or R10 can be introduced into ester compounds 3 by treatment with a base like potassium tert-butoxide or sodium hydride in solvents like tetrahydrofuran or 1,2-dimethoxyethane followed by addition of one or sequentially two different alkyl halides, a reaction preferably performed between 0°C and 80°C (step b). Mono and/or dialkyl ester compounds 4 can be reduced to compounds 5 e. g. with lithium aluminium hydride in ether or tetrahydrofuran (step c). Alternatively,   ester   compounds   4   can   be   transformed  into   compounds   5   by  i)<br><br>
saponification to the corresponding acid; ii) treatment with R'Li optionally in the presence of a Cu(I) salt in ether or tetrahydrofiiran to yield the alkyl ketones -COR9; iii) subsequent reaction with R10Li or lithium aluminium hydride in ether or tetrahydrofuran (step c). Optionally, an elongation of the side chain can then be performed by standard methods, such as transformation of the alcohol function into a leaving group, e. g. a mesylate, ensuing treatment with cyanide, saponification and reduction, affording thiazoles 6 with an optionally substituted hydroxy-propyl function attached to position 4 (step d). Alternatively, cyano intermediates of this elongation process can be reacted with alkyl Grignard reagents R9MgX in solvents like ether or tetrahydrofiiran between 0°C and the reflux temperature of the solvent to form the corresponding R9CO- alkyl ketones which upon treatment with an alkyllithium reagent R10Li or lithium aluminium hydride in solvents like ether or tetrahydrofuran give alcohols 6 (step d). The alcohol compounds 5 or 6 which contain one or more chiral centers can optionally be separated into optically pure antipodes by methods well known in the art, e. g. chromatography on a chiral HPLC column or by derivatization with an optically pure acid to form esters, which can be separated by conventional HPLC chromatography and then be converted back to the original alcohol. The alcohol compounds 5 or 6 correspond to or can be converted into compounds of general formula 8 (scheme 1), 7 (scheme 2) or 1 (scheme 3) e. g. by treatment with methanesulfonyl chloride in dichloromethane in the presence of a base like triethylamine preferably in a temperature range between -20°C and room temperature or e. g. by reaction with carbon tetrachloride or carbon tetrabromide and triphenylphosphine in solvents like tetrahydrofuran preferably in a temperature range between room temperature and the reflux temperature of the solvents.<br><br><br>
Thioamides 1 can be reacted with 2-halo acetoacetates 2 in solvents like ethanol, preferably at reflux temperature, to give thiazole-carboxylic esters 3 (step a). 2-Halo acetoacetates 2 are known or can be prepared by methods known in the art [compare PCT Int. Appl. (2002), WO 02/062774 Al]. Reduction of these esters 3, preferably using lithium aluminium hydride in a solvent like ether or tetrahydrofuran, preferably between 0°C and room temperature, gives primary alohols 4 (step b), which can be used as such or can be converted into the corresponding halides 5, e. g. by treatment with methanesulfonyl chloride in dichloromethane in the presence of 2,6-lutidine, preferably between -20° C and the reflux temperature of dichloromethane [compare PCT Int. Appl.

Appl. (2002), WO 02/062774 All (step d). Alkohols 6 with R9<br><br>
not equal to R can be prepared by a sequential procedure: i) saponification to the acid; ii) treatment with R Li optionally in the presence of a Cu(I) salt in ether or tetrahydrofuran to yield the alkyi ketones -COR9; iii) subsequent reaction with R10Li or lithium aluminium hydride in ether or tetrahydrofuran (step d). Primary alcohols 4 can be oxidized to aldehydes 7 by methods known in the art, e. g. by treatment with pyridinium chlorochromate in dichloromethane, preferably at temperatures between room temperature and the reflux temperature of dichloromethane or by treatment with manganese dioxide in solvents like dichloromethane, preferably at room temperature (step e). These aldehydes 7 can be converted to the corresponding secondary alcohols 8 through reaction with alkyi organometallic compounds, preferably under the conditions given for the transformation of esters 3 to tertiary alcohols 6 (step f).<br>
Reaction of thioamides 1 with 2-halo 1,3-diketones 9 in solvents like ethanol, preferably at reflux temperature, gives thiazole ketones 10 (step g). Alternatively, ketones 10 can be obtained from secondary alcohols 8 by methods known in the art, e. g. by treatment with Cr(VI) reagents like the Jones reagent (Jones et al.,/. Chem. Soc 1953, 2548) (step i). These ketones 10 can be reduced to the corresponding secondary alcohols 8 by methods known in the art, e. g. by treatment with sodium borohydride in alcohol, preferably at temperatures between -15 °C and 40 °C (step h). This reaction can also be carried out in stereoselective fashion leading to the (R)- or (S)-alcohols 8, e. g. by treatment with borane-dimethylsulfide complex and (S)- or (R)-2-methyl-CBS-oxazaborolidine as chiral catalyst in tetrahydrofuran, preferably at temperatures between —78 °C and ambient temperature according to Corey et al. (E. J. Corey, R. K. Bakshi, S. Shibata, /. Am. Chem. Soc. 1987,109, 5551-5553). If the alcohol compounds 4, 6, or 8 contains one or more chiral centers and are not optically pure, they can optionally be separated into optically pure antipodes by methods well known in the art, e. g. chromatography on a chiral HPLC column or by derivatization with an optically pure acid to form esters, which can be separated by conventional HPLC chromatography and then be converted back to the original alcohol.<br>
The alcohol compounds 4, 6, and 8 and the halide compound 5 correspond to or can be converted into compounds of general formula 8 (scheme 1), 7 (scheme 2) or 1 (scheme 3) e. g. by treatment with methanesulfonyl chloride in dichloromethane in the presence of a base like triethylamine preferably in a temperature range between -20°C and room temperature or e. g. by reaction with carbon tetrachloride or carbon tetrabromide and triphenylphosphine in solvents like tetrahydrofuran preferably in a temperature range between room temperature and the reflux temperature of the solvents.<br><br><br>
Thioamides 1 may be condensed with 1,3-dichloroacetone in solvents like acetone or acetonitrile between room temperature and the reflux temperature of the solvents, followed by treatment with a strong acid, e. g. concentrated sulfuric acid, preferably at ambient temperature leading to chloromethyl compounds 3 (step a). Alternatively, thioamides 1 are condensed with alpha-bromo or alpha-chloro ketones 4 in a solvent like ethanol, preferably at reflux temperature, to give aryl-thiazoles 5 bearing a methyl function at position 4 (step b) [compare Eur. Pat. Appl (1987), EP 207453 A2].'By treatment of these aryl-thiazoles 5 with N-chlorosuccinimide in solvents like acetonitrile, preferably at reflux temperature, chloromethyl compounds 6 are obtained (step c) [compare PCT Int. Appl. (2001), WO 0119805 Al]. Chloromethyl compounds 3 and 6 can be converted into hydroxymethyl compounds 7 e. g. by formation of the primary acetates (e. g. with acetic acid in the presence of sodium iodide, potassium carbonate at elevated temperature) and subsequent saponification (e. g. with lithium hydroxide in ethanol / water at room<br><br>
temperature) (step d). Hydroxymethyl compounds 7 can be oxidized in one step to the corresponding acids 8, e. g. by use of oxidizing agents like chromic acid, permanganate or nitric acid; alternatively, a two step procedure can be used: i) oxidation of the hydroxymethyl compounds 7 to the corresponding aldehydes using e. g. Swern conditions (oxalyl chloride / dimethylsulfoxide / triethylamine in dichloromethane, -78°C to room temperature); ii) subsequent oxidation to the acid compounds 8 by using e. g. sodium chlorite in an alcohol like tert-butanol and water in the presence of NafMPCU and 2-methyl-2-butene preferably at room temperature (step e). Acid compounds 8 or the corresponding esters can be further transformed as described for esters 3 or the corresponding acids in scheme 12 to give the substituted alcohol compounds 9.<br>
The alcohol compounds 7 and 9 and the halide compounds 3 and 6 correspond to or can be converted into compounds of general formula 8 (scheme 1), 7 (scheme 2) or 1 (scheme 3) e. g. by treatment with methanesulfonyl chloride in dichloromethane in the presence of a base like triethylamine preferably in a temperature range between -20°C and room temperature or e. g. by reaction with carbon tetrachloride or carbon tetrabromide and triphenylphosphine in solvents like tetrahydrofuran preferably in a temperature range between room temperature and the reflux temperature of the solvents.<br><br>

Aryl-thiazole alkanols 1 with a chain length of n carbon atoms can be converted into analogues with a chain length of n+1 carbon atoms by methods well known in the art, e. g. by conversion of the primary alcohol function into a suitable leaving group, e. g. a halide (step a), reaction with cyanide ion (step b), saponification (step c) followed by reduction of the acid formed (compounds 4) to the primary alcohols 5, e. g. by using diborane in tetrahydrofuran (step d). In order to introduce substituents R9 and/or R10 different from hydrogen, cyano intermediates 3 of this elongation process can be reacted with alkyl Grignard reagents R9MgX in solvents like ether or tetrahydrofuran between 0°C and the reflux temperature of the solvents to form the corresponding R9CO- alkyl ketones which upon treatment with an alkyllithium reagent R10Li or lithium aluminium hydride in solvents like ether or tetrahydrofuran give alcohols 5, R9CO- alkyl ketones can also be reduced e. g. by treatment with sodium borohydride in alcohol, preferably at temperatures between -15 °C and 40 °C. This reaction can also be carried out in stereoselective fashion leading to the (R)- or (S)-alcohols 5, e. g. by treatment with borane-dimethylsulfide complex and (S)- or (R)-2-methyl-CBS-oxazaborolidine as chiral catalyst in tetrahydrofuran, preferably at temperatures between -78 °C and ambient temperature according to Corey et al. (E. J. Corey, R. K. Bakshi, S. Shibata, /. Am. Chem. Soc. 1987,109, 5551-5553). Alternatively, alcohol compounds 5 which contain one or more chiral centers can optionally be separated into optically pure antipodes by methods well known in the art, e. g. chromatography on a chrial HPLC column or by derivatization with an optically pure acid to form esters, which can be separated by conventional HPLC chromatography and then be converted back to the original alcohol. The alcohol compounds 5 correspond to or can be converted into compounds of general formula 8 (scheme 1), 7 (scheme 2) or 1 (scheme 3) e. g. by treatment with methanesulfonyl chloride in dichloromethane in the presence of a base like triethylamine preferably in a temperature range between -20°C and room temperature or e. g. by reaction with carbon tetrachloride or carbon tetrabromide<br><br>
and triphenylphosphine in solvents like tetrahydrofiiran preferably in a temperature range between room temperature and the reflux temperature of the solvents.<br><br>

Background information on the performed assays can be found in: Nichols JS et al. "Development of a scintillation proximity assay for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma ligand binding domain55, (1998) Anal. Biochem. 257:112-119.<br>
Full-length cDNA clones for human PPARa and mouse PPARy were obtained by RT-PCR from human adipose and mouse liver cRNA, respectively, cloned into plasmid vectors and verified by DNA sequencing. Bacterial and mammalian expression vectors were constructed to produce glutathione-s-transferase (GST) and Gal4 DNA binding domain proteins fused to the Kgand binding domains (LBD) of PPARy (aa 174 to 476) and PPARa (aa 167 to 469). To accomplish this, the portions of the cloned sequences encoding the LBDs were amplified from the full-length clones by PCR and then subcloned into the plasmid vectors. Final clones were verified by DNA sequence analysis.<br>
Induction, expression, and purification of GST-LBD fusion proteins were performed in E. colt strain BL21(pLysS) cells by standard methods (Ref: Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Wiley Press, edited by Ausubel et al.).<br>
Radioligand Binding Assays<br>
PPARa receptor binding was assayed in TKE50 (50mM Tris-HCl, pH 8, 50 mM KC1, 2mM EDTA, 0.1 mg/ml fatty acid-free BSA and 10 mM DTT). For each 96 well reaction a 140 ng equivalent of GST-PPARa-LBD fusion protein was bound to 10 ug SPA beads (PharmaciaAmersham) in a final volume of 50 ul by shaking. The resulting slurry was incubated for lh at RT and centrifuged for 2 min at 1300g. The supernatant containing unbound protein was removed and the semidry pellet containig the recptor-coated beads was resolved in 50 ul of TKE. For radioligand binding e.g. 10000 dpm of 2(S)-(2-benzoyl-phenylamino)-3-{4-[l,l-cBtritio-2-(5-^<br>
propionic acid or 2,3-ditritio-2(S)-methoxy-3-{4-[2-(5-methyl-2-phenyl-oxazol-4-yl)-ethoxy]-benzo[b]thiophen-7-yl}-propionic acid in 50 ul were added, the reaction incubated at RT for lh and scintillation proximity counting performed. All binding assays were performed in 96 well plates and the amount of bound ligand measured on a Packard TopCount using OptiPlates (Packard). Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of lO^M unlabelled compound. Dose response curves were done in triplicates within a range of concentration from 10"10 M to 10"4 M.<br>

Luciferase Transcriptional Reporter Gene Assays<br>
Baby hamster kidney cells (BHK21 ATCC CCL10) were grown in DMEM medium containing 10% FBS at 37°C in a 950/o02:5%C02 atmosphere. Cells were seeded in 6 well plates at a density of 105 Cells/well and then batch-transfected with either the pFA-PPARy-LBD or pFA-PPARa-LBD expression plasmids plus a reporter plasmid and an expression plasmid encoding the secretable form of alkaline phosphatase (SEAP) as a normalization control. Transfection was accomplished with the Fugene 6 reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the suggested protocol. Six hours following transfection, the cells were harvested by trypsinization and seeded in 96 well plates at a density of 104 cells/well. After 24 hours to allow attachment of cells, the medium was removed and replaced with 100 ul of phenol red-free medium containing the test substances or control ligands (final DMSO concentration: 0.1%). Following incubation of the cells for 24 hours with substances, 50 ul of the supernatant was recovered and analyzed for SEAP activity (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The remainder of the supernatant was discarded, 50 ul PBS was added per well followed by one volume of Luciferase Constant-Light Reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) to lyse the cells and initiate the luciferase reaction. Luminescence for both SEAP and luciferase was measured in a Packard TopCount. Luciferase activity was normalized to the SEAP control and transcriptional activation in the presence of a test substance was expressed as fold-activation over cells incubated in the absence of the substance. EC50 values were calculated using the XLfit program (ID Business Solutions Ltd. UK).<br>

The compounds of formula (I) and their pharmaceutical^ acceptable salts and esters can be used as medicaments, e.g. in the form of pharmaceutical preparations for enteral, parenteral or topical administration. They can be administered, for example, perorally, e.g. in the form of tablets, coated tablets, dragees, hard and soft gelatine capsules, solutions, emulsions or suspensions, rectally, e.g. in the form of suppositories, parenterally, e.g. in the form of injection solutions or infusion solutions, or topically, e.g. in the form of ointments, creams or oils.<br>
The production of the pharmaceutical preparations can be effected in a manner which will be familiar to any person skilled in the art by bringing the described compounds of formula (I) and their pharmaceutical^ acceptable, into a galenical administration form together with suitable, non-toxic, inert, therapeutically compatible solid or liquid carrier materials and, if desired, usual pharmaceutical adjuvants.<br>
Suitable carrier materials are not only inorganic carrier materials, but also organic carrier materials. Thus, for example, lactose, corn starch or derivatives thereof, talc, stearic acid or its salts can be used as carrier materials for tablets, coated tablets, dragees and hard gelatine capsules. Suitable carrier materials for soft gelatine capsules are, for example, vegetable oils, waxes, fats and semi-solid and liquid polyols (depending on the nature of the active ingredient no carriers are, however, required in the case of soft gelatine capsules). Suitable carrier materials for the production of solutions and syrups are, for example, water, polyols, sucrose, invert sugar and the like. Suitable carrier materials for injection solutions are, for example, water, alcohols, polyols, glycerol and vegetable oils. Suitable carrier materials for suppositories are, for example, natural or hardened oils, waxes, fats and semi-liquid or liquid polyols. Suitable carrier materials for topical preparations are glycerides, semi-synthetic and synthetic glycerides, hydrogenated oils, liquid waxes, liquid paraffins, liquid fatty alcohols, sterols, polyethylene glycols and cellulose derivatives.<br>
Usual stabilizers, preservatives, wetting and emulsifying agents, consistency-improving agents, flavour-improving agents, salts for varying the osmotic pressure, buffer substances, solubilizers, colorants and masking agents and antioxidants come into consideration as pharmaceutical adjuvants.<br>
The dosage of the compounds of formula (I) can vary within wide limits depending on the disease to be controlled, the age and the individual condition of the patient and the mode of administration, and will, of course, be fitted to the individual requirements in each particular case. For adult patients a daily dosage of about 1 mg to about 1000 mg, especially about 1 mg to about 100 mg, comes into consideration. Depending on the dosage it is convenient to administer the daily dosage in several dosage units.<br><br>
The pharmaceutical preparations conveniently contain about 0.1-500 mg, preferably 100 mg, of a compound of formula (I).<br>

Peroxisome Proliferator Activated Receptors PPAR  are memDers or me nuciear hormone receptor super family, which are ligand-activated transcription factors regulating gene expression. Various subtypes thereof have been identified and cloned. These include PPARce, PPAR|3 (also known as PPARS), and PPARy. There exist at least two major isoforms of PPARy. While PPARy 1 is ubiquitously expressed in most tissues, the longer isoform PPARy2 is almost exclusively found in adipocytes. In contrast, PPARa is predominantly expressed in the liver, kidney and heart PPAR's modulate a variety of body responses including glucose- and lipid- homeostasis, cell differentiation, inflammatory responses and cardiovascular events.<br>
Diabetes is a disease in which a patient's ability to control glucose levels in blood is impaired, because he has partially lost the ability to respond properly to the action of insulin. In type II diabetes (T2D), often referred to as non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), which afflicts 80-90 % of all diabetic patients in developed countries, the Isles of Langerhans in the pancreas still produce insulin. However, the target organs, mainly muscle, liver and adipose tissue, exhibit a profound resistance to insulin stimulation, and the body compensates by producing unphysiologically high levels of insulin. In later stage of disease, however, insulin secretion decreases due to exhaustion of the pancreas. In addition to that T2D is a metabolic-cardiovascular disease syndrome. Among the comorbidities associated with T2D are for example insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, hypertension, endothelial dysfunction and inflammatory atherosclerosis.<br>
Current first line treatment for diabetes generally involves low fat - and glucose - diet and exercise. However, compliance can be moderate and as the disease progresses, treatment with hypoglycemic drugs, e.g. sulfonylureas or metformin, becomes necessary. A promising new class of drugs has recently been introduced that resensitizes patients to their own insulin (insulin sensitizers), thereby reverting blood glucose and triglyceride levels to normal, and thus abolishing, or at least reducing, the requirement for exogenous insulin. Pioglitazone (Actos    ) and rosiglitazone (Avandia l ) belong to the thiazolidinediones (TZD) class of PPARy-agonists and were the first representatives who had been approved for NIDDM in several countries. These compounds, however, suffer from side effects including rare but severe liver toxicity (as seen with troglitazone), and they increase body weight in humans. Therefore, new, better and more efficacious drugs for the treatment of NIDDM are urgendy needed. Recent studies provide evidence that a coagonism on PPARot and PPARy would result in compounds with enhanced therapeutic potential, i. e. such compounds should improve the lipid profile in addition to the normalization of glucose- and insulin-levels (Keller and Wahli: Trends Endocrin. Metab. 1993; 4:291-296, Macdonald and Lane: Current Biology Vol.5 pp.618-621 (1995)). Recent observations suggest furthermore that there is an independent PPARa mediated effect on<br><br>
insulin-sensitzation that could result secondary to the reduction in lipids (Guerre-Millo et al; J Biol Chem2000; 275:16638-16642). Consequently, the incorporation of PPARa activity into PPARy agonists is expected to give rise to more efficacious drugs for the treatment and/or prevention of diabetes.<br>
The novel compounds of the present invention exceed the compounds known in the art, inasmuch as they bind to and activate both, PPARa and PPARy, simultaneously and very efficiently. Therefore, these compounds combine the anti-glycemic effect of PPARy activation with the anti-dyslipidemic effect of PPARa activation. Consequently, plasma glucose and insulin are reduced (=insulin sensitization), triglycerides lowered and HDL cholesterol increased (=improved lipid profile). In addition, such compounds may also lower LDL cholesterol, decrease blood pressure and counteract inflammatory atherosclerosis. Since multiple facets of the T2D disease syndrome are addressed by PPARa and y coagonists, they are expected to have an enhanced therapeutic potential compared to the compounds already known in the art.<br>
The compounds of the present invention further exhibit improved pharmacological properties compared to known compounds.<br>

The compounds of formula (I) can be manufactured by the methods given below, by the methods given in the examples or by analogous methods. Appropriate reaction conditions for the individual reaction steps are known to a person skilled in the art. Starting materials are either commercially available or can be prepared by methods analogous to the methods given below, by methods described in references cited in the text or in the examples, or by methods known in the art.<br>
Racemates of compounds of formula (I) [compounds 9 and compounds 10 in scheme 1] can e. g. be synthesized according to the methods depicted in scheme 1 or by analogous methods.<br>
Homochiral compounds of formula (I) (compounds 8 and 9 in scheme 2 and compounds 6 and 7 in scheme 3) can be prepared according to the methods depicted in scheme 2 and 3 or by analogous methods.<br><br><br>
Aldehydes 1 can be reacted with a Wittig salt 2 such as (l,2-diethoxy-2-oxoethyl)triphenyl phosphonium chloride or (l&gt;2-dimethoxy-2-oxoethyl)triphenyl phosphonium bromide in solvents like isopropanol, dichloromethane or tetrahydrofuran or mixtures thereof in the presence of a base like potassium carbonate, l,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene (DBU) or 1,1,3,3-tetramethyl-guanidine, preferably between 0°C and the reflux temperature of the solvents, giving acrylic esters 3 as E and/or Z isomers (step a). Hydrogenation of acrylic esters 3 using palladium on charcoal as catalyst, preferably at room temperature and 1 atm. pressure of hydrogen, in solvents like methanol, ethanol, tetrahydrofuran, acetic acid, dichloromethane and mixtures thereof, affords racemic esters 7, provided that the protecting group can be cleaved reductively (step f). Hydrogenation of compounds in<br><br>
which R -R together with the attached benzene ring form a benzofuran moiety can be performed using extended reaction times to provide the corresponding benzo-dihydrofiiran analogues. In compounds, in which R3-R4 together with the attached benzene ring form a benzothiophene or a benzofuran moiety, the reduction of the double bond is preferably performed with a reducing metal like magnesium in solvent mixtures like tetrahydrofuran / methanol between room temperature and the reflux temperature of the solvents leading to saturated compounds 6 (step e). Subsequently, the protecting group like a benzyl ether is cleaved, e. g. by using dimethyl sulfide and boron trifluoride diethyl etherate in a solvent like dichloromethane between room temperature and the reflux temperature of the solvent to give phenolic compounds 7 (step h).<br>
Alternatively, aldehydes 1 are reacted with the enolate of alkanoic acid esters or alkoxy- or aryloxy-acetic acid esters 4 (preferably the lithium-enolate, prepared at -78°C by treatment of 4 with a strong, non-nucleophilic base like lithium diisopropylamide in an inert solvent like tetrahydrofuran), preferably at temperatures around -78°C, in solvents like tetrahydrofuran giving the aldol product 5 as a mixture of diasteromers (step b). Removal of the benzylic hydroxy group in 5 with a reducing agent like e. g. triethylsilane in the presence of a Lewis acid, like boron-trifluoride, or a protic acid, like trifluoroacetic acid, in a suitable solvent like trifluoroacetic acid itself or dichloromethane between 0°C and 60°C yields racemic esters 6 (step d); ensuing removal of the protecting group, e. g. a benzyloxy function, can then be performed by standard technology, e. g. catalytic hydrogenation using hydrogen and a, catalyst like palladium to give phenolic compounds 7 (step h). Catalytic hydrogenation can also be used to convert in one step benzyl protected hydroxy compounds 5 into phenolic compounds 7 (step g), preferably using palladium on charcoal as catalyst in the presence of an acid like oxalic acid in solvents like alcohols at temperatures around room temperature and a hydrogen pressure up to 100 bar. The cleavage of the protective function can also be performed before the removal of the benzylic hydroxy group; in such a case, similar reaction conditions can be chosen for the removal of the benzylic hydroxy group as just described for the transformation of compounds 5.<br>
As an alternative method, compounds 5 can be treated with catalytic amounts of an acid like para toluene sulfonic acid in a solvent like benzene or toluene, preferably under conditions allowing the removal of the water formed (e. g. with a Dean Stark trap or in the presence of molecular sieves) at temperatures between room temperature and the reflux temperature of the solvents to yield acrylic esters 3 (step c).<br>
Aryl-thiazole compounds 8 (prepared as outlined in schemes 11-14) are condensed with phenols 7 according to well known procedures: if Ru represents a hydroxy group e. g. via Mifstmo&amp;u-reaction, with triphenylphosphine and di-tert-butyl-, diisopropyl- or diethyl-<br><br>
azodicarboxylate as reagents; this transformation is preferably carried out in a solvent like toluene, dichloromethane or tetrahydrofuran at ambient temperature. Alternatively, if RL1 represents a halide, mesylate or tosylate moiety, the aryl-thiazole compounds 8 can be reacted with phenols 7 in solvents like N,N-dimethylformamide, acetonitrile, acetone or methyl-ethyl ketone in the presence of a weak base like cesium or potassium carbonate at a temperature ranging from room temperature to 140°C, preferably around 50°C to yield ether compounds 9 (step i). Those can optionally be hydrolyzed according to standard procedures, e. g. by treatment with an alkali hydroxide like LiOH or NaOH in a polar solvent mixture like tetrahydrofuran/ethanol/water leading to carboxylic acids 10 (step k). If the aryl-thiazole compounds 8 (prepared as described in schemes 11-14) contain chiral centers, ester compounds 9 and carboxylic acids 10 are obtained as mixtures of diastereomers, which can be separated by methods well known in the art, e. g. HPLC chromatography or crystallization.<br><br><br>
Homochiral alpha-substituted-phenyl-propionic acid esters of formula 8 and free acids of formula 9 can be prepared according to the method depicted in scheme 2 or by analogous methods known in the art.<br>
The well known chiral auxiliary 2 [(S)-4-benzyl-oxazolidin-2-one] is condensed with an alkanoyl chloride or an alkoxy- or aryloxy-acetyl chloride 1 in the presence of a strong base like n-butyl lithium in an inert solvent like tetrahydrofuran at temperatures around -78°C to produce building block 3 (step a). The latter is then treated according to literature precedence [Tetrahedron Asymmetry (1999), 10,1353-1367] with dibutylboron-triflate and a tertiary amine like triethylamine in dichloromethane to generate the corresponding<br><br>
boron enolate, which is subsequently reacted at low temperatures with aldehydes 4 resulting in compounds 5 (step b). In compounds 5, one of all four possible stereoisomers is strongly predominating (stereochemistry as indicated without rigorous proof with respect to the benzylic position). Compounds 5 are converted into phenolic intermediates 6 via a three step sequence encompassing: i) carefully controlled ester formation using only a minimal excess of alcoholate in the corresponding alcohol as solvent or in solvents like tetrahydrofiiran or dioxane at temperatures ranging from -20°C to room temperature (step c); ii) reductive removal of the benzylic hydroxy group as described above for the conversion of compounds 5 to compounds 6 in scheme 1 (step d); iii) removal of the protecting group by standard technology (step e); the order of the three reaction steps c, d, e is interchangeable, and the simultaneous removal of the benzyhc hydroxy function and a benzyl protecting group as described for the conversion of compounds 5 to compounds 7 in scheme 1 is also possible. The transformation of phenolic intermediates 6 into ester 8 and / or acids 9 can be performed in perfect analogy as described for racemic phenolic intermediates 7 in scheme 1 (steps f and g). If carefully controlled reaction conditions are applied as detailed in the experimental part, hardly any racemisation occurs during this reaction sequence. The optical purity of compounds 8 and 9 can be determined by chiral HPLC or by ^-NMR-spectroscopy in the presence of a chiral solvent like l-(9-anthryl)-2,2,2-trifluoro-ethanol. If the aryl-thiazole compounds 7 (prepared as described in schemes 11-14) contain chiral centers and are not optically pure, ester compounds 8 and carboxylic acids 9 are obtained as mixtures of diastereomers, which can be separated by methods well known in the art, e. g. HPLC chromatography or crystallization.<br><br><br>
Homochiral alpha-substituted-phenyl-propionic acid esters of formula 6 and free acids of formula 7 can also be prepared according to a linear synthetic sequence depicted in scheme 3. Thus, reaction types already described in scheme 2 are used in a different order beginning with the condensation of aryl-thiazole synthons 1 with phenols 2 affording ether compounds 3 bearing an aldehyde moiety (step a). These ether compounds 3 are then<br><br>
reacted with the chiral synthons (compounds 3 in scheme 2) to form aldol-adducts 4 (step b). Removal of the benzylic hydroxy function in compounds 4 leads to compounds 5 (step c), which can be converted into the corresponding esters 6 (step d) or acids 7 (step e) as described for the analogous reactions in scheme 1 and 2, respectively. Optionally, ester compounds 6 can be hydrolysed to acids 7 (step f). If the aryl-thiazole compounds 1 (prepared as described in schemes 11-14) contain chiral centers and are not optically pure, ester compounds 6 and carboxylic acids 7 are obtained as mixtures of diastereomers, which can be separated by methods well known in the art, e. g. HPLC chromatography or crystallization.<br>
Aldehydes 1 (scheme 1), aldehydes 4 (scheme 2), aldehydes 2 (scheme 3), are known or can be synthesized by methods known in the art. Examples for possible syntheses of these key intermediates are given in schemes 4-10.<br><br>
Known phenols 1 can be transformed into aldehydes 3 either by known formylation reactions such as e. g. the Vilsmeier formylation, by treatment with hexamethylene tetramine under acidic conditions, e. g. in the presence of sulfuric acid or preferably with trifluoroacetic acid as solvent between 0°C and the reflux temperature of trifluoroacetic acid, or by formylation with dichloromethyl methyl ether in the presence of titanium tetrachloride, preferably in dichloromethane at temperatures between -78°C and the reflux temperature of the solvent (step a); alternatively, a two step procedure might be used: introduction of a halogen atom into the para position, e.g. by use of N-bromo- or N-iodo-succinimide, e. g. in a mixture of concentrated sulfuric acid and tetrahydrofuran preferably at ambient temperature, followed by a metal halogen exchange, realized by<br><br>
treatment with an alkyl-lithium reagent like n-butyllithium, preferably at temperatures around -78°C, and quenching the resulting aryl-Li with a formyl transfer reagent like N,N-dimethylformamide or N-formyl-piperidine (steps b and c). Alternatively, a carbonylation reaction can be used for the introduction of the formyl group in step c, e. g. by use of sodium formate, bis(triphenylphosphine) palladium(II) dichloride and CO gas in a solvent like N,N-dimethylformamide, preferably at temperatures around 100°C<br><br>
4-Hydrosy-benzofuran 5 (R6=H)[Synthetic Communications (1986), 16(13), 1635-1640; Helvetica Chimica Acta (1933), 16,121-129] and 4-hydroxy-benzothiophene 9 (R6=H) [Jpn. Kokai Tokkyo Koho (2001), 2001048876A2] are known. Thus, cyclohexane-1,3-diones 1 carrying variable substituents R6 at the 5-position can be reacted with bromo-pyruvic acid in methanol in the presence of a base like potassium hydroxide at temperatures between 0°C and the reflux temperature of methanol followed by treatment with hydrochloric acid at around 100°C to give fiiran-carboxylic acids 3 (step a). Treatment of these furan-carboxylic acids 3 in an inert solvent like decahydro-naphthalene in the presence of a hydrogen acceptor like dodecene and palladium on carbon, preferably at reflux, provides carboxy-benzofurans 4 (step b), which are decarboxylated to<br><br>
benzofurans 5, e. g. by using copper powder in quinoline at temperatures between 200°C and 240°C (step c). Similar to the transformations described in scheme 4, benzofurans 5 can finally be converted into formylated benzofuran intermediates 6 (step d).<br>
Treatment of 2-thiophenecarbaldehyde 7 with suitable vinyl-lithium- or vinyl-magnesium-derivatives in solvents like tetrahydrofuran or 1,2-dimethoxy-ethane, preferably in a temperature range between -78°C and room temperature, followed by in situ treatment with acetic anhydride yields thiophenes 8 with variable substitution R6 (step e). Treatment of thiophenes 8 with carbon monoxide, preferably at a pressure of 20 to 60 bar, a palladium catalyst like palladium acetate, a phosphine like triphenylphosphine, in solvent mixtures which may typically contain acetic anhydride, triethylamine, toluene or tetrahydrofuran, preferably in a temperature range between 100°C to 160°C, affords after saponification of the acetate function benzothiophenes 9 (step f). Similar to the transformations described in scheme 4, benzothiophenes 9 can finally be converted into formylated benzothiophene intermediates 10 (step g).<br><br><br>
2-Hydroxy~3-methoxy-benzddehyde 1, optionally substituted with bromine in position 5, can be transformed into benzo[b]thiophen-7-ol 6 or 5-bromo-benzo[b]thiophen-7-ol 6. This sequence can be carried out in analogy to the method described in J. Chem. Soc, Perkin Trans. 1 1983(12), 2973-7; for the transformation of 2-hydroxy-3-methoxy-benzaldehyde into benzo[b]thiophen-7-ol. It involves the following steps: treatment with N,N-dimethylthiocarbamoyl chloride in a solvent like tetrahydrofiiran in the presence of an aqueous base like potassium hydroxide in water or in the presence of an organic base like diisopropyl-ethyl-amine, preferably at temperatures between 0°C and room temperature, generates thionocarbamates 2 (step a); thermal rearrangement of compounds 2 without solvent or preferably in an inert solvent like diphenyl ether at temperatures between 200°C and 280°C leads to arylthiocarbamates 3 (step b); saponification in a<br><br>
solvent like an alcohol with a base like sodium or potassium hydroxide, preferably between room temperature and the reflux temperature of the solvents, leads then to thiophenols 4 (step c); reaction of these thiophenols 4 with sodium chloroacetate in water or a water / alcohol mixture in the presence of a base like sodium or potassium hydroxide in a temperature range between room temperature and the reflux temperature of the solvents produces then benzothiophene-carboxylic acids 5 (step d); decarboxylation, e. g. in quinoline in the presence of copper bronze at temperatures between 200°C and 240°C, followed by cleavage of the methyl ether function, e. g. by treatment with aqueous hydrobromic acid in acetic acid at reflux, then yields benzo[b]thiophen-7-ols 6 (step e). Similar to the transformations described in scheme 4, benzo[b]thiophen-7-ols 6 can finally be converted into formylatedbenzo[b]thiophen-7-ol intermediates 7 (step f).<br>
7-Hydroxy-benzofiiran is known and commercially available [J. Med. Chem. (1987), 30(1), 62-7]. In a sequence similar to that described above, the 5-bromo-analogue can be prepared from 2-hydroxy-3«methoxy-benzaldehyde 1 by reaction with ethyl chloro-actetate in a solvent like N,N-dimethylformamide in the presence of a base like potassium carbonate at temperatures between 60°C and 120°C yielding benzofuran carboxylic acid 8 (step g). Decarboxylation as described above and ensuing ether cleavage, preferably with pyridine hydrochloride at temperatures around 200°Q then leads to 5-bromo-7-hydroxy-benzofiiran 9 (step h). Similar to the transformations described in scheme 4, 5-bromo-7-hydroxy-benzofuran 9 can finally be converted into formylated 5-bromo-7-hydroxy-benzofuran intermediate 10 (step i).<br><br><br>
l-Hydroxy-4-formyl-naphthalene 1 and 2,3-annelated phenols 2 with a ring size of 5, 6 and 7 are commercially available or known [see J. Am. Chem. Soc. (1988), 110(19), 6471-6480; U.S. (2000) 6121397; PCTInt. Appl. (1999) WO99/10339]. Similar to the transformations described in scheme 4,2,3-annelated phenols 2 can be converted into formylated 2,3-annelated phenols 3 (step a).<br>
3-Bromo-l-hydroxy-naphthalene 5, an intermediate carrying a functionality, which allows synthetic modifications at a later stage, can be prepared from 3-nitxo-l-methoxy-naphthalene 4 [Monatsh. Chem. (1992), 123(6-7), 637-645] by well established procedures, i. e. reduction of the nitro function, e. g. by hydrogenation in the presence of a palladium catalyst, followed by diazotisation, Sandmeyer reaction and cleavage of the<br><br>
methyl ether function giving 3-bromo-l-hydroxy-naphthalene 5 (steps b, c, d). Similar to the transformations described in scheme 4,3-bromo-l-hydroxy-naphthalene 5 can be converted into 3-bromo-4-formyl-l-hydroxy-naphthalene 6 (step e).<br>
2,3-Annelated carboxylic acids 7 are known, their 3-bromo analogues 8 are known or can be prepared by established methods of bromination of aromatic nuclei [J. Org. Chem. (1978), 43(11), 2167-70; Ger. Offen. (1977), DE 2633905] (step f). Such 3-bromo-benzoic acids can then be converted into the corresponding phenols 9 by known methods such as e. g. exhaustive reduction with borane to the corresponding alcohol, oxidation, e. g. using Swern conditions (oxalyl chloride / dimethylsulfoxide / triethylamine in dichloromethane, -78°C to room temperature), to the corresponding aldehyde, followed by Baeyer-Villiger oxidation e. g. with peracetic acid (40%) in acetic acid (steps g, h, i). Similar to the transformations described in scheme 4, phenols 9 can be converted into intermediates 10 (stepk).<br><br><br>
Bromo-methoxy compound 1 characterized by an annelated dihydro-2H-pyran ring is known [Can. J. Chem. (1982), 60(16), 2093-8]. Cleavage of the methoxy ether function with pyridine hydrochloride at temperatures around 200°C leads to 3-bromo-phenol 2 (step a). Similar to the transformations described in scheme 4, compound 2 can be converted into intermediate 3 (step b).<br>
The isomeric building block can be obtained as follows: Carboxylic acid 4 [U.S. (1999), US 5856529 A] can be brominated to give the 3-bromo derivative 5 (step c), which can be transformed into phenol 6 by a sequence analogous to that described for the transformation of compounds 8 into compounds 9 in scheme 7 (steps d, e, f). Similar to the transformations described in scheme 4, phenol 6 can be converted into intermediate 7 (stepg).<br><br>
3-Bromo-phenols 1 (intermediates 6, scheme 6, intermediates 9, scheme 6, intermediates 5, scheme 7, intermediates 9&gt; scheme 7, as well as intermediates 2 and 6, scheme 8), optionally carrying a protective function, can be converted into analogous phenols 2 carrying variable substiutents R6 by first transforming the bromo-compound into the corresponding aryl-lithium derivative (e. g. by using an alkyl lithium reagent in a solvent like tetrahydrofuran, preferably at a temperature around -78°C) and then quenching the latter with a variety of electrophiles using methods well known in the art (step a). For the synthesis of phenols (R6=OH), the aryl lithium compounds 'are reacted with trimethyl-borate at temperatures between -78°C and the reflux temperature of tetrahydrofuran, followed by oxidation e. g. with N-methyl morpholine N-oxide or H2O2 / NaOH, preferably at the reflux temperature of tetrahydrofuran [compare Synlett 1995(09), 931-932]. These phenols 2 with R6 equal OH can then be transformed into the corresponding ether compounds by well known methods. Similar to the reaction sequence described in scheme 4, phenolic compounds 2 can finally be converted into phenolic aldehyde intermediates 3 (step b).<br><br><br>
Phenols 1, optionally carrying a protecting group, can be further transformed into phenols 2 carrying additional substutents R5 by known methods of electrophilic aromatic substitution. In many cases, mixture of ortho / para - substitution-, and ortho / para -disubstitution-products will be formed in ratios depending on the precise reaction conditions. In such cases, the reaction conditions can be optimized in order to achieve the highest possible yield of mono-ortho product; optionally, product mixtures can also be separated into pure isomers by known methods such as silica gel chromatography (step a). 4-Formyl compounds 3 can be obtained from phenols 1, optionally carrying a protecting group, by transformations as described in scheme 4 (step b). 4-Formyl compounds 3 can then again be used as starting materials applying known methods of electrophilic aromatic substitutions leading to compounds 4 carrying an additional R5 substituent (step c). Alternatively, compounds 4 may be obtained from phenols 2 by transformations as described in scheme 4 (step d).<br><br><br>
Thioamides 1 are known or can be prepared by methods known in the art, e. g. by treatment of the corresponding carboxamide with phosphorus pentasulfide or with Lawesson's Reagent [2,4-bis(4-methoxyphenyl)-13"dithia-2&gt;4-diphosphetane-2J4-disulfide] in a solvent like toluene at temperatures preferably between 60°C and the reflux temperature of the solvent. Condensation of thioamides 1 with a suitable bis-electrophile, e. g. methyl 4-bromo- or 4-chloro-3-oxo-alkanoates 2, preferably in a solvent like toluene at elevated temperatures (e. g. at reflux temperature), gives thiazoles 3 carrying an acetic acid ester function at position 4 (step a) [compare PCT Int. Appl (1997), WO97/31907 Al]- 4-Bromo-3-oxo-alkanoates 2 are known or can be prepared by methods known in the art [compare PCT Int. Appl. (2001), WO 01/79202 Al]. Thiazoles 3 can then be reduced, e. g. with lithium aluminum hydride in solvents like in ether or tetrahydrofuran, to thiazoles 5 with R9 = R10 = H (step c). Alternatively, alkyl groups R9 and/or R10 can be introduced into ester compounds 3 by treatment with a base like potassium tert-butoxide or sodium hydride in solvents like tetrahydrofuran or 1,2-dimethoxyethane followed by addition of one or sequentially two different alkyl halides, a reaction preferably performed between 0°C and 80°C (step b). Mono and/or dialkyl ester compounds 4 can be reduced to compounds 5 e. g. with lithium aluminium hydride in ether or tetrahydrofuran (step c). Alternatively,   ester   compounds   4   can   be   transformed  into   compounds   5   by  i)<br><br>
saponification to the corresponding acid; ii) treatment with R'Li optionally in the presence of a Cu(I) salt in ether or tetrahydrofiiran to yield the alkyl ketones -COR9; iii) subsequent reaction with R10Li or lithium aluminium hydride in ether or tetrahydrofuran (step c). Optionally, an elongation of the side chain can then be performed by standard methods, such as transformation of the alcohol function into a leaving group, e. g. a mesylate, ensuing treatment with cyanide, saponification and reduction, affording thiazoles 6 with an optionally substituted hydroxy-propyl function attached to position 4 (step d). Alternatively, cyano intermediates of this elongation process can be reacted with alkyl Grignard reagents R9MgX in solvents like ether or tetrahydrofiiran between 0°C and the reflux temperature of the solvent to form the corresponding R9CO- alkyl ketones which upon treatment with an alkyllithium reagent R10Li or lithium aluminium hydride in solvents like ether or tetrahydrofuran give alcohols 6 (step d). The alcohol compounds 5 or 6 which contain one or more chiral centers can optionally be separated into optically pure antipodes by methods well known in the art, e. g. chromatography on a chiral HPLC column or by derivatization with an optically pure acid to form esters, which can be separated by conventional HPLC chromatography and then be converted back to the original alcohol. The alcohol compounds 5 or 6 correspond to or can be converted into compounds of general formula 8 (scheme 1), 7 (scheme 2) or 1 (scheme 3) e. g. by treatment with methanesulfonyl chloride in dichloromethane in the presence of a base like triethylamine preferably in a temperature range between -20°C and room temperature or e. g. by reaction with carbon tetrachloride or carbon tetrabromide and triphenylphosphine in solvents like tetrahydrofuran preferably in a temperature range between room temperature and the reflux temperature of the solvents.<br><br><br>
Thioamides 1 can be reacted with 2-halo acetoacetates 2 in solvents like ethanol, preferably at reflux temperature, to give thiazole-carboxylic esters 3 (step a). 2-Halo acetoacetates 2 are known or can be prepared by methods known in the art [compare PCT Int. Appl. (2002), WO 02/062774 Al]. Reduction of these esters 3, preferably using lithium aluminium hydride in a solvent like ether or tetrahydrofuran, preferably between 0°C and room temperature, gives primary alohols 4 (step b), which can be used as such or can be converted into the corresponding halides 5, e. g. by treatment with methanesulfonyl chloride in dichloromethane in the presence of 2,6-lutidine, preferably between -20° C and the reflux temperature of dichloromethane [compare PCT Int. Appl. (2002), WO 02/28433], by treatment with thionyl chloride in a solvent like dichloromethane or chloroform preferably at temperatures between -20°C and +50°C or by treatment with tetrabromomethane, triphenylphosphine in solvents like tetrahydrofuran at temperatures i between 0°C and the reflux temperature of the tetrahydrofuran (step c). Esters 3 can be further converted into tertiary alcohols 6 with R9 = R10 through reaction with alkyl organometallic reagents, preferably using alkyl Grignard compounds in a solvent like tetrahydrofuran or ether, preferably between -15 °C and the reflux temperature of the solvent [compare PCT Int. Appl. (2002), WO 02/062774 All (step d). Alkohols 6 with R9<br><br>
not equal to R can be prepared by a sequential procedure: i) saponification to the acid; ii) treatment with R Li optionally in the presence of a Cu(I) salt in ether or tetrahydrofuran to yield the alkyi ketones -COR9; iii) subsequent reaction with R10Li or lithium aluminium hydride in ether or tetrahydrofuran (step d). Primary alcohols 4 can be oxidized to aldehydes 7 by methods known in the art, e. g. by treatment with pyridinium chlorochromate in dichloromethane, preferably at temperatures between room temperature and the reflux temperature of dichloromethane or by treatment with manganese dioxide in solvents like dichloromethane, preferably at room temperature (step e). These aldehydes 7 can be converted to the corresponding secondary alcohols 8 through reaction with alkyi organometallic compounds, preferably under the conditions given for the transformation of esters 3 to tertiary alcohols 6 (step f).<br>
Reaction of thioamides 1 with 2-halo 1,3-diketones 9 in solvents like ethanol, preferably at reflux temperature, gives thiazole ketones 10 (step g). Alternatively, ketones 10 can be obtained from secondary alcohols 8 by methods known in the art, e. g. by treatment with Cr(VI) reagents like the Jones reagent (Jones et al.,/. Chem. Soc 1953, 2548) (step i). These ketones 10 can be reduced to the corresponding secondary alcohols 8 by methods known in the art, e. g. by treatment with sodium borohydride in alcohol, preferably at temperatures between -15 °C and 40 °C (step h). This reaction can also be carried out in stereoselective fashion leading to the (R)- or (S)-alcohols 8, e. g. by treatment with borane-dimethylsulfide complex and (S)- or (R)-2-methyl-CBS-oxazaborolidine as chiral catalyst in tetrahydrofuran, preferably at temperatures between —78 °C and ambient temperature according to Corey et al. (E. J. Corey, R. K. Bakshi, S. Shibata, /. Am. Chem. Soc. 1987,109, 5551-5553). If the alcohol compounds 4, 6, or 8 contains one or more chiral centers and are not optically pure, they can optionally be separated into optically pure antipodes by methods well known in the art, e. g. chromatography on a chiral HPLC column or by derivatization with an optically pure acid to form esters, which can be separated by conventional HPLC chromatography and then be converted back to the original alcohol.<br>
The alcohol compounds 4, 6, and 8 and the halide compound 5 correspond to or can be converted into compounds of general formula 8 (scheme 1), 7 (scheme 2) or 1 (scheme 3) e. g. by treatment with methanesulfonyl chloride in dichloromethane in the presence of a base like triethylamine preferably in a temperature range between -20°C and room temperature or e. g. by reaction with carbon tetrachloride or carbon tetrabromide and triphenylphosphine in solvents like tetrahydrofuran preferably in a temperature range between room temperature and the reflux temperature of the solvents.<br><br><br>
Thioamides 1 may be condensed with 1,3-dichloroacetone in solvents like acetone or acetonitrile between room temperature and the reflux temperature of the solvents, followed by treatment with a strong acid, e. g. concentrated sulfuric acid, preferably at ambient temperature leading to chloromethyl compounds 3 (step a). Alternatively, thioamides 1 are condensed with alpha-bromo or alpha-chloro ketones 4 in a solvent like ethanol, preferably at reflux temperature, to give aryl-thiazoles 5 bearing a methyl function at position 4 (step b) [compare Eur. Pat. Appl (1987), EP 207453 A2].'By treatment of these aryl-thiazoles 5 with N-chlorosuccinimide in solvents like acetonitrile, preferably at reflux temperature, chloromethyl compounds 6 are obtained (step c) [compare PCT Int. Appl. (2001), WO 0119805 Al]. Chloromethyl compounds 3 and 6 can be converted into hydroxymethyl compounds 7 e. g. by formation of the primary acetates (e. g. with acetic acid in the presence of sodium iodide, potassium carbonate at elevated temperature) and subsequent saponification (e. g. with lithium hydroxide in ethanol / water at room<br><br>
temperature) (step d). Hydroxymethyl compounds 7 can be oxidized in one step to the corresponding acids 8, e. g. by use of oxidizing agents like chromic acid, permanganate or nitric acid; alternatively, a two step procedure can be used: i) oxidation of the hydroxymethyl compounds 7 to the corresponding aldehydes using e. g. Swern conditions (oxalyl chloride / dimethylsulfoxide / triethylamine in dichloromethane, -78°C to room temperature); ii) subsequent oxidation to the acid compounds 8 by using e. g. sodium chlorite in an alcohol like tert-butanol and water in the presence of NafMPCU and 2-methyl-2-butene preferably at room temperature (step e). Acid compounds 8 or the corresponding esters can be further transformed as described for esters 3 or the corresponding acids in scheme 12 to give the substituted alcohol compounds 9.<br>
The alcohol compounds 7 and 9 and the halide compounds 3 and 6 correspond to or can be converted into compounds of general formula 8 (scheme 1), 7 (scheme 2) or 1 (scheme 3) e. g. by treatment with methanesulfonyl chloride in dichloromethane in the presence of a base like triethylamine preferably in a temperature range between -20°C and room temperature or e. g. by reaction with carbon tetrachloride or carbon tetrabromide and triphenylphosphine in solvents like tetrahydrofuran preferably in a temperature range between room temperature and the reflux temperature of the solvents.<br><br>

Aryl-thiazole alkanols 1 with a chain length of n carbon atoms can be converted into analogues with a chain length of n+1 carbon atoms by methods well known in the art, e. g. by conversion of the primary alcohol function into a suitable leaving group, e. g. a halide (step a), reaction with cyanide ion (step b), saponification (step c) followed by reduction of the acid formed (compounds 4) to the primary alcohols 5, e. g. by using diborane in tetrahydrofuran (step d). In order to introduce substituents R9 and/or R10 different from hydrogen, cyano intermediates 3 of this elongation process can be reacted with alkyl Grignard reagents R9MgX in solvents like ether or tetrahydrofuran between 0°C and the reflux temperature of the solvents to form the corresponding R9CO- alkyl ketones which upon treatment with an alkyllithium reagent R10Li or lithium aluminium hydride in solvents like ether or tetrahydrofuran give alcohols 5, R9CO- alkyl ketones can also be reduced e. g. by treatment with sodium borohydride in alcohol, preferably at temperatures between -15 °C and 40 °C.

The following tests were carried out in order to determine the activity of the compounds of formula (I).<br>
Background information on the performed assays can be found in: Nichols JS et al. "Development of a scintillation proximity assay for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma ligand binding domain55, (1998) Anal. Biochem. 257:112-119.<br>
Full-length cDNA clones for human PPARa and mouse PPARy were obtained by RT-PCR from human adipose and mouse liver cRNA, respectively, cloned into plasmid vectors and verified by DNA sequencing. Bacterial and mammalian expression vectors were constructed to produce glutathione-s-transferase (GST) and Gal4 DNA binding domain proteins fused to the Kgand binding domains (LBD) of PPARy (aa 174 to 476) and PPARa (aa 167 to 469). To accomplish this, the portions of the cloned sequences encoding the LBDs were amplified from the full-length clones by PCR and then subcloned into the plasmid vectors. Final clones were verified by DNA sequence analysis.<br>
Induction, expression, and purification of GST-LBD fusion proteins were performed in E. colt strain BL21(pLysS) cells by standard methods (Ref: Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Wiley Press, edited by Ausubel et al.).<br>
Radioligand Binding Assays<br>
PPARa receptor binding was assayed in TKE50 (50mM Tris-HCl, pH 8, 50 mM KC1, 2mM EDTA, 0.1 mg/ml fatty acid-free BSA and 10 mM DTT). For each 96 well reaction a 140 ng equivalent of GST-PPARa-LBD fusion protein was bound to 10 ug SPA beads (PharmaciaAmersham) in a final volume of 50 ul by shaking. The resulting slurry was incubated for lh at RT and centrifuged for 2 min at 1300g. The supernatant containing unbound protein was removed and the semidry pellet containig the recptor-coated beads was resolved in 50 ul of TKE. For radioligand binding e.g. 10000 dpm of 2(S)-(2-benzoyl-phenylamino)-3-{4-[l,l-cBtritio-2-(5-^<br>

All binding assays were performed in 96 well plates and the amount of bound ligand measured on a Packard TopCount using OptiPlates (Packard). Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of lO^M unlabelled compound. Dose response curves were done in triplicates within a range of concentration from 10"10 M to 10"4 M.<br>

Luciferase Transcriptional Reporter Gene Assays<br>
Baby hamster kidney cells (BHK21 ATCC CCL10) were grown in DMEM medium containing 10% FBS at 37°C in a 950/o02:5%C02 atmosphere. Cells were seeded in 6 well plates at a density of 105 Cells/well and then batch-transfected with either the pFA-PPARy-LBD or pFA-PPARa-LBD expression plasmids plus a reporter plasmid and an expression plasmid encoding the secretable form of alkaline phosphatase (SEAP) as a normalization control. Transfection was accomplished with the Fugene 6 reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the suggested protocol. Six hours following transfection, the cells were harvested by trypsinization and seeded in 96 well plates at a density of 104 cells/well. After 24 hours to allow attachment of cells, the medium was removed and replaced with 100 ul of phenol red-free medium containing the test substances or control ligands (final DMSO concentration: 0.1%). Following incubation of the cells for 24 hours with substances, 50 ul of the supernatant was recovered and analyzed for SEAP activity (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The remainder of the supernatant was discarded, 50 ul PBS was added per well followed by one volume of Luciferase Constant-Light Reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) to lyse the cells and initiate the luciferase reaction. Luminescence for both SEAP and luciferase was measured in a Packard TopCount. Luciferase activity was normalized to the SEAP control and transcriptional activation in the presence of a test substance was expressed as fold-activation over cells incubated in the absence of the substance. EC50 values were calculated using the XLfit program (ID Business Solutions Ltd. UK).<br>

The production of the pharmaceutical preparations can be effected in a manner which will be familiar to any person skilled in the art by bringing the described compounds of formula (I) and their pharmaceutical^ acceptable, into a galenical administration form together with suitable, non-toxic, inert, therapeutically compatible solid or liquid carrier materials and, if desired, usual pharmaceutical adjuvants.<br>
Suitable carrier materials are not only inorganic carrier materials, but also organic carrier materials. Thus, for example, lactose, corn starch or derivatives thereof, talc, stearic acid or its salts can be used as carrier materials for tablets, coated tablets, dragees and hard gelatine capsules. Suitable carrier materials for soft gelatine capsules are, for example, vegetable oils, waxes, fats and semi-solid and liquid polyols (depending on the nature of the active ingredient no carriers are, however, required in the case of soft gelatine capsules). Suitable carrier materials for the production of solutions and syrups are, for example, water, polyols, sucrose, invert sugar and the like. Suitable carrier materials for injection solutions are, for example, water, alcohols, polyols, glycerol and vegetable oils. Suitable carrier materials for suppositories are, for example, natural or hardened oils, waxes, fats and semi-liquid or liquid polyols. Suitable carrier materials for topical preparations are glycerides, semi-synthetic and synthetic glycerides, hydrogenated oils, liquid waxes, liquid paraffins, liquid fatty alcohols, sterols, polyethylene glycols and cellulose derivatives.<br>
Usual stabilizers, preservatives, wetting and emulsifying agents, consistency-improving agents, flavour-improving agents, salts for varying the osmotic pressure, buffer substances, solubilizers, colorants and masking agents and antioxidants come into consideration as pharmaceutical adjuvants.<br>
The dosage of the compounds of formula (I) can vary within wide limits depending on the disease to be controlled, the age and the individual condition of the patient and the mode of administration, and will, of course, be fitted to the individual requirements in each particular case. For adult patients a daily dosage of about 1 mg to about 1000 mg, especially about 1 mg to about 100 mg, comes into consideration. Depending on the dosage it is convenient to administer the daily dosage in several dosage units.<br><br>
