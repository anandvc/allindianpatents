				<td>The invenmtion relates to a method and apparatus for securing and levelling an object.<br>
    BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION	<br><br>
This invention relates generally to leveling apparatuses and, more particularly, to an apparatus for securing and leveling equipment and machinery.<br>
Equipment often must be secured to a floor or wall for stability, for seismic reasons or for maintaining alignment with other equipment. In addition to anchoring, some equipment requires adjustment during or after field installation, for instance, to level the equipment or to align the equipment with other equipment.<br>
It is common to align or level equipment using adjusters installed adjacent the equipment anchors. Adjustment in this manner, however, applies torque to the equipment  e anchoring .Such torque could distort the equipment. Although spacers or shims are commonly used to control distortion, the exact height of the appropriate spacer or shim is not known before the need for it has arisen. Therefore, a large variety of spacers or shims is kept in inventory.<br>
Accordingly, it would be desirable to eliminate the distortion of anchored equipment resulting from leveling or alignment. It also would be desirable to level or align equipment without having to maintain spacers or shims in inventory.<br>
BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
In one exemplary embodiment of the present invention, a leveling and securing apparatus includes an anchor bolt installed through a center of an aligning device and into a floor. The aligning device includes a hollow adjuster threaded<br>
r<br>
through a section or extension of the equipment. The aligning device also includes a leveling pad positioned on the floor and on which the adjuster rests.  The adjuster and leveling padcontact each other with matched spherical surfaces.  The anchor bolt is installed through the adjuster and leveling pad and has clearance for lateral<br><br>
motion within the aligning device. The equipment is raised or lowered by threading the adjuster up or down within the equipment. Lateral adjustment of the equipment is facilitated by the freedom of the anchor bolt to move laterally within the aligning device and leveling pad.<br>
The above described leveling and securing apparatus facilitates leveling of equipment without spacers or shims. Also, due to the location of the anchor bolt in the center of the aligning device, anchored equipment is leveled and aligned without distortion of the equipment.<br>
To meet the aforementioned objectives, the invention provides for a method for securing and leveling an object utilizing at least one leveling and securing apparatus including an anchor assembly and an aligning device, the aligning device including an adjuster having a threaded outer surface, a lock ring having a threaded inner surface, and a leveling pad configured to be connected to the adjuster by a spherical joint, the aligning device further including an interior surface defining a passage through the adjuster and the leveling pad, the anchor assembly including an anchor bolt for installation through the passage and into an anchoring surface, said method comprising the steps of:<br>
connecting the leveling and securing apparatus to the object;<br>
placing the object in a position to be secured;<br>
installing the anchor bolt through the passage of the aligning device and<br>
into the anchoring surface;<br>
threading the adjuster relative to the object; and<br>
threadedly engaging the lock ring on the adjuster threaded outer surface to<br>
immobilize the adjuster relative to the object.<br><br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
Figure 1 is an exploded perspective view of one embodiment of a leveling and securing apparatus according to the present invention.<br>
Figure 2 is an elevational view of the leveling and securing apparatus illustrated in Figure 1.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
In one embodiment and as shown in Figure 1, an apparatus 10 for leveling and securing an object or equipment 12 includes an aligning device 14 and an anchor assembly 16 that extends coaxially within aligning device 14. Aligning device 14 includes a hollow adjuster 18 and a leveling pad 20. Adjuster 18 includes a threaded outer surface 22 extending through a threaded opening 24 in equipment 12. Adjuster 18 also includes a beveled bottom 26 and an upper ring of projections 28. A washer 30 rests upon, but is not attached to, upper ring of projections 28. Upper ring 9f projections 28 includes a projection ring diameter 32 and washer 30 includes a washer diameter 34 that is larger than projection ring diameter 32. Leveling pad 20 is flat-bottomed, annular sad includes a central depression 36, into which beveled bottom 26 of adjuster 18 tits to form a spherical joint 38. Aligning device 14 also includes a lock ring 40 including a threaded inner surface 42 that is<br><br>
threaded upon threaded outer surface 22 of adjuster 18. Lock ring 40 also includes a grooved outer surface 44.<br>
Anchor assembly 16 includes an anchor bolt 46 that extends through washer 30, adjuster 18 and leveling pad 20 into a floor or anchoring surface 48. Aligning device 14 includes an interior surface 50 that defines a passage 52 through aligning device 14 and through which anchor bolt 46 extends. Passage 52 has a passage diameter 54 and anchor bolt 46 has a bolt diameter 56 that is smaller than passage diameter 54. Anchor bolt 46 includes a threaded upper portion 58 upon which a nut 60 is threaded. An installation kit 62 includes a drill bushing 64, an adjuster tool 66 and an alignment tool 68.<br>
Referring to Figure 2, apparatus 10 is installed and used in the following manner. Leveling pad 20 is placed upon floor 48 and is centered at the location into which anchor bolt 46 is to be installed. Adjuster 18 is threaded through equipment 12 using adjuster tool 66 and is connected to leveling pad 20 at spherical joint 38. Drill bushing 64 is inserted into adjuster 18 to facilitate drilling a hole 70 into floor 48. Washer 30 is installed onto anchor bolt 46 and anchor bolt 46 is inserted through adjuster 18 and leveling pad 20 into floor 48. Nut 60 is threaded on anchor bolt threaded upper portion 58, and anchor assembly 16 is hammered into hole 70. Alignment tool 6s is useful for installation in a corner (not shown) of floor 48 or other location inaccessible to a drill (not shown) after equipment 12 has been put into place. Alignment tool 68 is inserted through adjuster 18 and is used to position equipment 12 over a pre-drilled hole (not shown) in floor 48 for installation of anchor assembly 16.<br>
In us"e, apparatus 10 allows equipment 12 to be adjusted both vertically and laterally. Vertical adjustment is accomplished by threading adjuster 18 up or down within equipmer,, 12. A spanner wrench (not shown) is applied to upper ring of projections 28 to raise or lower adjuster 18. After vertical adjustment, lock ring 40<br><br>
is threaded on the threaded outer surface 22 of adjuster 18 and into frictional contact with equipment 12 to maintain adjuster 18 and equipment 12 in their adjusted relative positions. Lock ring 40 is positioned by applying a spanner wrench (not shown) to grooved outer surface 44. Lateral adjustment is facilitated in two ways. Because passage diameter 54 is larger than bolt diameter 56, a degree of lateral movement of equipment 12 is facilitated by the loose fit of anchor bolt 46 within passage 52. Also, spherical joint 38 permits tilting of leveling pad 20 relative to adjuster 18 and equipment 12, thus allowing equipment 12 to be leveled where floor 48 is non-level. Washer 30 moves laterally with anchor assembly 16 while maintaining anchor assembly 16 at the desired vertical location relative to adjuster 18 and hole 70.<br>
