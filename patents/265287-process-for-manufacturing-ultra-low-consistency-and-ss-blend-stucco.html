				<td>PROCESS FOR MANUFACTURING ULTRA LOW CONSISTENCY α-AND<br>
β- BLEND STUCCO<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[001 ] This invention relates to an improved method of making calcined gypsum<br>
which results in an ultra-low consistency alpha- and beta- blend stucco. In<br>
particular, the present invention provides a process which comprises a slurry<br>
calcination step in a first reactor to produce alpha calcium sulfate hemihydrate<br>
followed by a calcination step, for example a fluidized bed calcination step, in a<br>
second reactor to produce beta calcium sulfate hemihydrate.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[002] Gypsum calcium sulfate dihydrate, CaSO4-2H2O comes from a variety of<br>
sources. Land plaster is a term for natural gypsum which is any mixture<br>
containing more than 50% calcium sulfate dihydrate, CaS04.2H2O (by weight).<br>
[003] Generally, gypsum-containing products are prepared by forming a mixture<br>
of calcined gypsum phase (i.e., calcium sulfate hemihydrate and/or calcium<br>
sulfate soluble anhydrite) and water, and, optionally, other components, as<br>
desired. The mixture typically is cast into a pre-determined shape or onto the<br>
surface of a substrate. The calcined gypsum reacts with the water to form a<br>
matrix of crystalline hydrated gypsum, i.e., calcium sulfate dihydrate. It is the<br>
desired hydration of calcined gypsum that enables the formation of an<br>
interlocking matrix of set gypsum, thereby imparting strength to the gypsum<br>
structure in the gypsum-containing product.<br>
[004] Stucco is defined as chemically calcium sulfate hemihydrate and is a well-<br>
known building material used to make building plasters and gypsum wallboard.<br>
Stucco is typically made by crushing the gypsum rock with and then heating the<br>
gypsum at atmospheric pressure to calcine (dehydrate) the calcium sulfate<br>
dihydrate into calcium sulfate hemihydrate. In addition to natural gypsum rock<br>
the use of Flue Gas Desulphurization gypsum or gypsum from chemical<br>
processes can be used as well. Traditionally, the calcining of gypsum has<br><br>
occurred in a large atmospheric pressure kettle containing a mixture of the<br>
various phases of the gypsum<br>
[005] US Patent No. 5,927,968 to Rowland et al., incorporated herein by<br>
reference in its entirety, discloses its own method and apparatus for continuous<br>
calcining of gypsum in a refractoryless atmospheric kettle. However, US Patent<br>
No. 5,927,968 to Rowland et al. also discloses a variety of kettles for calcining<br>
stucco. One such kettle has a thickened dome-shaped bottom, against which a<br>
gas-fired flame is directed, with the kettle and burner flame being enclosed in a<br>
suitable refractory structure. There is usually an associated hot pit into which the<br>
calcined material is fed. The kettle must withstand temperatures in the 2,000 -<br>
2,400 °F (1093 - 1314 °C) range. US Patent No. 5,927,968 to Rowland et al.<br>
states US Patent No. 3,236,509 to Blair typifies this type construction.<br>
[006] U.S. Pat. No. 3,236,509 to Blair, incorporated herein by reference,<br>
discloses continuous fluidized kettle calcination in which dried mineral gypsum<br>
powder is fed to a covered, but air vented and lightly vacuum exhausted,<br>
calcination vessel. After a steady state of operation is attained in the vessel, a<br>
substantially continuous stream of cold gypsum that has been pre-dried and<br>
ground to a finely divided state and with a wide distribution of fragmented particle<br>
sizes, is added on top of the fluidized, boiling mass in the kettle. Under such<br>
conditions, the thermal shock upon the cold, dry mineral being dropped into the<br>
already boiling mass radically fractures the ground gypsum rock fragments, and<br>
the resultant stucco (beta hemihydrate) is highly fractured and fissured, as well<br>
as being widely distributed in particle size. This causes the stucco to disperse<br>
very rapidly in water, and requires high amounts of gauging water to be mixed<br>
with the stucco for rehydration to gypsum at customary use consistencies.<br>
[007] This "dispersed consistency", also known in the art as "consistency" or<br>
"water demand", is an important property of stucco. Stuccos of lower<br>
consistency generally result in stronger casts.<br>
[008] The normal consistency of stucco (gypsum plaster) is a term of art and is<br>
determinable according to ASTM Procedure C472, or its substantial equivalents.<br>
It is defined as the amount of water in grams per 100 grams of stucco.<br><br>
[009] US Patent No. 4,533,528 to Zaskalicky, incorporated herein by reference<br>
in its entirety, discloses directly feeding wet chemical gypsum cake to a<br>
continuous kettle calciner to produce beta hemihydrate of lower consistency. As<br>
explained in Zaskalicky, and also for purposes of the present description,<br>
"dispersed consistency" may be defined as the water volume required to give a<br>
standard viscosity or flow when a standard amount by weight of stucco is<br>
dispersed by mechanical mixing in a laboratory mixer at high shear intensity and<br>
for a standard time to equal mixing encountered in the gypsum board forming<br>
line, e.g., 7 seconds, or in an industrial plaster formulation casting mixer, e.g. 60<br>
seconds.<br>
[0010] For example, as explained in US Patent No. 4,201,595 to O'Neill,<br>
incorporated herein by reference in its entirety, calcined gypsum made by<br>
continuous calcination may have a dispersed consistency of about 100-150 cc.<br>
"Dispersed consistency" for purposes of gypsum board manufacture may be<br>
defined as the water volume required to give a standard viscosity or flow when<br>
100 grams of stucco is dispersed by mechanical mixing in a laboratory high<br>
speed blender at high shear intensity and for 7 seconds which is equivalent to<br>
the mixing encountered in the board forming line. While the dispersed<br>
consistency may be expressed in a particular numerical figure, it will be<br>
appreciated that any particular number is variable from one process to the next<br>
depending on the particular stucco and the rate of production.<br>
[0011] Low consistency stucco is particularly advantageous in automated<br>
gypsum board manufacture, in which a large portion of the processing time and<br>
processing energy is devoted to removing excess water from the wet board.<br>
Considerable excess water is required in gypsum board manufacture to properly<br>
fluidize the calcined gypsum and obtain proper flow of the gypsum slurry.<br>
[0012] A dispersed consistency value of 100-150 cc. indicates a water<br>
requirement of about 85-100 parts of water per 100 parts of the calcined<br>
gypsum for a typical slurry in a gypsum wallboard plant. The theoretical water<br>
required to convert the calcined gypsum (calcium sulfate hemihydrate or stucco)<br><br>
to set gypsum dihydrate is only 18.7% by weight on a pure basis. This leaves<br>
about 67 to about 82% of the water present in the gypsum slurry to be removed<br>
in drying the board. Ordinarily, gypsum board dryers in a gypsum board<br>
manufacturing line will remove this water, for example, by maintaining the air<br>
temperature at about 400 °F (204 °C) and requiring a drying time of about 40<br>
minutes.<br>
[0013] US Patent Nos. 4,201,595 (also mentioned above), 4,117,070 and<br>
4,153,373 to O'Neill, all incorporated herein by reference in their entirety, teach<br>
to lower the dispersed consistencies of continuously calcined kettle stuccos by<br>
an after calcination treatment of the stucco with small amounts of water or<br>
various aqueous solutions, resulting in a damp but dry appearing material and<br>
allowing the small amounts of free water to remain on the calcined gypsum<br>
particle surface for a short period of time, about 1-10 minutes for the treated<br>
stucco to "heal".<br>
[0014] U.S. Patent No. 3,410,655 to Ruter et al., incorporated herein by<br>
reference in its entirety, teaches producing alpha calcium sulfate hemihydrate.<br>
Ruter et al. states the alpha-hemihydrate forms non-needle like crystals, as<br>
opposed to the beta calcium sulfate hemihydrate which forms needle-like<br>
crystals. Ruter et al. also states the usual plaster of Paris (calcium sulfate<br>
hemihydrate) is the beta calcium sulfate hemihydrate. However, depending on<br>
the manner of preparation, the plaster of Paris still contains more or less<br>
anhydrous calcium sulfate, and/or alpha calcium sulfate hemihydrate. Moreover,<br>
plasters with definite alpha-hemihydrate content exhibit higher strengths. Ruter<br>
et al. teaches to make alpha calcium sulfate hemihydrate in the form of non-<br>
needle-like crystals by elutriating the dihydrate with water to remove organic<br>
impurities and fine and slimy crystal portions, forming an aqueous suspension of<br>
the dihydrate at a pH about 1.5-6, and subsequently heating under closely<br>
controlled conditions.<br>
[0015] US Patent No. 2,907,667 to Johnson, incorporated herein by reference in<br>
its entirety, states alpha-hemihydrate is prepared by heating the dihydrate under<br><br>
controlled vapor pressure conditions in the presence of steam or in an aqueous<br>
solution.<br>
US Patent No. 4,234345 to Fassle discloses fast-setting alpha calcium sulfate<br>
hemihydrate made from calcium sulfate dihydrate by hydrothermally<br>
recrystallizing calcium sulfate dihydrate to form a mixture containing 95%-99%<br>
by weight alpha calcium sulfate hemihydrate and 5 to 1% calcium sulfate<br>
dihydrate. The dihydrate in this mixture is then converted to beta calcium sulfate<br>
hemihydrate by calcining, except for a remainder of up to 0.5 percent of<br>
dihydrate, which remains in the mixture.<br>
[0016] There is a need for stuccos having low consistency and good strength<br>
characteristics.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0017] It is an object of the invention to provide a process for making a stucco<br>
composition comprising alpha calcium sulfate hemihydrate and beta calcium<br>
sulfate hemihydrate.<br>
[0018] The present process starts with 50-75 % gypsum-containing solids by<br>
weight in aqueous slurry.<br>
[0019] Direct injection of steam of a quality between 100 to 200 psig, into the<br>
slurry in or prior to the first continuous stirred tank reactor, at 60 psig, converts<br>
50 to 95% wt. % of the gypsum solids to alpha calcium sulfate hemihydrate.<br>
This forms partially calcined gypsum slurry which contains calcium sulfate<br>
dihydrate and alpha calcium sulfate hemihydrate. In particular, about 80-90% wt.<br>
% or 70-85 wt. % of the gypsum is calcined to alpha calcium sulfate<br>
hemihydrate. The partially calcined gypsum slurry is then dewatered, for<br>
example in a Miter press to produce a filter cake of dewatered solids of 95 to 98<br>
% solids. The filter cakes temperature is maintained above 170 °F (77 °C)<br>
during the separation. Then the dewatered hot sotids are fed to an atmospheric<br>
kettle to complete the calcination process by converting the calcium sulfate<br>
dihydrate of the dewatered solids into beta calcium sulfate hemihydrate. The hot<br><br>
water (recovered without significant cooling) is returned to the feed of the<br>
process to minimize the energy used in the process. Alternately, the heat from<br>
the water can be used along with the waste heat from the kettle process to<br>
preheat the feed slurry of gypsum at the start of the process.<br>
[0020] The present process for making a blend of alpha- and beta-stucco results<br>
in near theoretical water demand for use in a board manufacturing process. The<br>
theoretical amount of water to hydrate 100 % pure CSH (calcium sulfate<br>
hemihydrate) to the gypsum form would be 21 parts of water to 100 parts of<br>
CSH. This process results in a water demand down to 21 parts with a minimum<br>
amount of dispersants or fluidizers required. Beta stucco alone has a water<br>
demand up to 140 parts of water and requires a large amount of dispersant to<br>
reach the flow characteristic of the alpha-beta blend stucco. Alternately a blend<br>
of alpha and beta hemihydrate can be made using powders. The resulting<br>
material requires more total energy if made by stand alone processes. Also, the<br>
resulting material requires a higher percentage of alpha to beta to achieve the<br>
same results. Therefore, the present invention provides a more economical<br>
calcining method to produce the alpha-beta stucco.<br>
[0021] The alpha hemihydrate aids in fluidity while the beta-hemihydrate aids in<br>
reactivity. The process can also be energy efficient because it can recycle hot<br>
water recovered from dewatering. Also, the solids are kept hot during<br>
dewatering to ensure the material does not hydrate back to gypsum.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING<br>
[0022] FIG. 1 is a process flow diagram of an embodiment of the process of the<br>
present invention.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
[0023] FIG. 1 shows an embodiment of an apparatus for performing the process<br>
of the present invention. Gypsum (calcium sulfate dihydrate) and water are<br>
mixed in a mixer (not shown) to form a 50-75% solids gypsum slurry 10.<br>
Gypsum slurry 10 is fed to a jacketed reactor 12 (autoclave). Steam 13 is also<br><br>
fed to the reactor 12 to provide heat. Other forms of heat may also be provided<br>
to the reactor 12 as appropriate. The feed gypsum may be any form of gypsum,<br>
such as land plaster, gypsum mineral from ground or unground sources,<br>
synthetic gypsum from flue gas desulfurization processes in power plants, or<br>
other chemical gypsum as by-products of the titanium dioxide industry.<br>
Traditionally the feed gypsum is land plaster manufactured by grinding gypsum<br>
rock to a fine particle size in a roller mill. The fineness of the land plaster is 95 to<br>
98 % less than 100 ASTM mesh. Land plaster gypsum purity can range from 80<br>
to 99 wt. % calcium sulfate dihydrate.<br>
[0024] A crystal modifier 14 may also be fed to the reactor 12 if desired. The<br>
crystal modifier 14 controls the crystal morphology of the calcium sulfate alpha<br>
hemihydrate to achieve a desired particle size, e.g., 50 to 20 microns (d50)<br>
average particle size. Prior to the dewatering of the alpha hemihydrate slurry<br>
additives may be added that will aid in the filtration, act as a hydration<br>
accelerator, and/or provide added fluidity to the final material.<br>
[0025] The slurry 10 is held in the reactor 12 at conditions for calcining the<br>
gypsum to partially convert it to alpha calcium sulfate hemihydrate, for example<br>
55 psig at 300 °F (149 °C). Typically, 50 to 95%, or 80 to 95 %, or 80 to 90% of<br>
the gypsum is converted by calcination to alpha calcium sulfate hemihydrate,<br>
alpha-CaSO4.0.5 H2O with a residence time of 5 minutes. The conversion can be<br>
controlled by changing the residence time or temperature of the reactor<br>
discharge. The higher the temperature the faster the conversion takes place.<br>
The longer the residence time the higher the conversion rate is achieved.<br>
[0026] Typically, the reactor 12 is a continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR)<br>
operating at a pressure of 15 to 100 psig (29.7 to 114.7 psia, 2.0 to 7.9 bar),<br>
preferably 25 to 75 psig (39.7 to 89.7 psia, 2.7 to 6.2 bar) or 35 to 55 psig (49.7<br>
to 69.7 psia, 3.4 to 4.8 bar). The temperature of the reactor 12 corresponds to<br>
the temperature of saturated steam at the operating pressure. For example, a<br>
pressure of about 52 psig (66.7 psia, 4.6 bar) corresponds to a temperature of<br><br>
about 300 °F (149 °C). The residence time of the slurry in the reactor 12<br>
generally ranges from 2 to 30 minutes, preferably 5 to 15 minutes.<br>
[0027] For example, in a typical embodiment, after the reactor 12 is closed, hot<br>
steam 13 is delivered to the jacket around the reactor 12 to heat the reactor 12<br>
for about 5 minutes. The change in temperature and pressure inside the reactor<br>
are monitored as a function of time. Then after about 10 minutes, the delivery<br>
pressure of the steam 13 was increased to bring the reaction to completion in<br>
about 5 additional minutes. The crystal modifiers 14 could, for example, be<br>
added to the slurry 10 before heating begins or while the slurry 10 is being<br>
heated or maintained at a desired temperature in the reactor 12.<br>
[0028] The partially calcined gypsum product 16 discharges from the reactor 12<br>
as a slurry comprising calcium sulfate dihydrate and alpha calcium sulfate<br>
hemihydrate and feeds an accumulator tank 20. Accumulator tank 20 acts as a<br>
holding tank and permits release of the steam as the slurry's pressure drops to<br>
atmospheric pressure. If desired the accumulator tank 20 may be omitted if the<br>
separation stage (dewatering unit 30) is direct coupled.<br>
[0029] The slurry 24 discharges from the accumulator tank 20 and feeds a<br>
dewatering unit 30 which removes water to produce a dewatered solids-<br>
containing product 32 and a removed water stream 34.<br>
[0030] All or a portion of the removed water 34 may be recycled as a stream 38<br>
to be part of the slurry 10 to assist in recycling water, heat and chemicals (such<br>
as the crystal modifiers or other additives) used in the process. Typically the<br>
stream 38 is recycled at an elevated temperature, such as 100 to 200 °F (38 to<br>
93 °C). The partially calcined gypsum product 16, the accumulator tank 20, the<br>
stream 24, the dewatering unit 30 and the dewatered product 32 are kept at a<br>
temperature sufficiently high to prevent the alpha hemihydrate from rehydrating,<br>
e.g., kept at elevated temperature of 160-212 °F (71-100°C).<br>
[0031] Typically the dewatering unit 30 is a filter press and/or centrifuge and the<br>
dewatered product 32 has a 2 to 6 wt. %, typically 4 %, free water moisture<br>
content. A typical filter press employs steam to press down on a plate over the<br>
partially calcined gypsum product slurry to drive out the water. If desired the<br><br>
process of Baehr US patent number 4,435,183 may be employed for dewatering<br>
and drying calcium sulfate hemihydrate in a centrifuging and flash drying<br>
operation by ejecting the wet solids from the centrifuge bowl directly into the<br>
flash dryer's high velocity, high volume, heated air stream. Baehr US patent<br>
number 4,435,183 is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
[0032] The dewatered product 32 is fed to a board stucco kettle calciner 40 at<br>
conditions to convert the majority or all of the gypsum in the dewatered product<br>
32 to beta calcium sulfate hemihydrate. The kettle calciner 40 typically is<br>
indirectly heated at atmospheric pressure by use of natural gas heating on the<br>
bottom and direct fired heated air 42. The material behaves as a fluidization bed<br>
due to the free water vapor leaving the solids fed to the kettle reactor 40 as well<br>
as the bound water released as the gypsum (calcium sulfate dihydrate) converts<br>
to calcined beta gypsum (beta calcium sulfate hemihydrate). Fluidization gas<br>
may also be provided by the indirect fired gas heated air or use of direct fired<br>
heated air 42. The kettle 40 typically operates at atmospheric pressure, and a<br>
temperature of from 150 to 1000 °F (66 to 538 °C), preferably 250 to 650 °F (121<br>
to 343 °C) or 400 to 500 °F (204 to 260 °C) or 285 to 300 °F (140 to 149 °C).<br>
[0033] The kettle 40 discharges a dry product 44 comprising alpha calcium<br>
sulfate hemihydrate and beta calcium sulfate hemihydrate (also known as an<br>
alpha and beta stucco blend). Optionally, the dry product 44 is sent to grinding<br>
50 to reduce the particle size of the material.<br>
[0034] Typically the dry product 44 has less than 5 wt. %, preferably less than 2<br>
wt. %, calcium sulfate anhydrite and less than 5 wt. %, preferably less than 2 wt.<br>
. %, calcium sulfate dihydrate.<br>
[0035] Typically the calcium sulfate of the final product is 50-95 wt. % alpha<br>
hemihydrates and 50 to 5 wt. % beta hemihydrate; for example, 70-85 wt %<br>
alpha hemihydrates and 30-15 wt % beta hemihydrate; or 80-90 wt. % alpha<br>
hemihydrates and 20-10 wt. % beta hemihydrates.<br>
[0036] The crystal modifier 14, if employed, is in the solution during the period of<br>
calcination to alpha hemihydrate. The pH of the solution is in the neutral range<br>
between 6 and 8. The crystal modifiers 14 act in reducing the number of nuclei<br><br>
that form in the solution and also restrain the growth of the crystal in one of its<br>
axis. The result is control of the particle size through control of the number of<br>
crystals forming and growing. The other result is that the shape of the crystal is<br>
cubic like in aspect ratio. With no modifiers in the solution the shape of the<br>
alpha hemihydrate would be a long acicular needle shaped crystal of aspect ratio<br>
up to 100:1 in length to diameter.<br>
[0037] The resulting alpha- beta-stucco blend typically has a number of<br>
desirable properties of consistency, compressive strength and density.<br>
[0038] For example, the typical dry product has a normal consistency of about<br>
30 to 36 as measured by a handmix drop consistency determination.<br>
[0039] In contrast to normal consistency measured according to ASTM<br>
Procedure C472, normal consistency as measured by a handmix drop<br>
consistency method is not ASTM Procedure C472 test. The test method for<br>
measuring normal consistency by a handmix drop consistency method is as<br>
follows.<br>
[0040] Weigh a 50 gram sample of the plaster to be tested at 70-80 °F (21-27<br>
°C) to 0.1 gram accuracy. Drained the mixing cup and spatula before using<br>
such that the mixing cup and spatula contain a maximum of 1/4 cc of<br>
adhering droplets of water or are wiped dry. Add water to the mixing cup from<br>
a burette (deionized or distilled at 70-80 °F (21-27 °C) unless otherwise<br>
specified) in the estimated quantity to produce the proper flow. Sift the plaster<br>
into the water and allow the sample to soak undisturbed for 60 seconds. Mix<br>
thoroughly for 30 seconds, stirring 90 to 100 complete revolutions with the<br>
spatula. Pour the slurry immediately after mixing on to a clean, dry,<br>
unscratched PLEXIGLASS sheet from a height of 1½ inch. At the correct con-<br>
sistency, the mix will flow out of the cup without the aid of the spatula.<br>
[0041] The mix should form a round patty of reasonably uniform thickness.<br>
The patty diameters for each specific consistency range are as follows in<br>
TABLE 1 (when measured in at least two directions and averaged):<br><br><br>
CRYSTAL MODIFIERS<br>
[0042] TABLE 2 presents typical crystal modifiers. Also, US Patent No.<br>
2,907,667 to Johnson, incorporated herein by reference, discloses a number of<br>
chemicals which impact reactions in reactors for making alpha calcium sulfate<br>
hemihydrate.<br><br>
[0043] The stucco composition of the invention can be used in both the<br>
manufacture of gypsum wallboard and stucco for production of a plaster for<br>
interior and exterior applications. One or more additives can be added to the<br>
stucco composition to facilitate the desired viscosity, and other optional<br>
additives may be added to achieve desired physical characteristics in the final<br><br>
set product, such as, for example, flexural strength, abuse resistance (e.g.,<br>
chip resistance), water resistance, flame resistance, and the like, or<br>
combinations thereof.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
[0044] A plant control and three plant trial examples of the present invention<br>
were conducted. In the Control and Examples, 75% solids slurry was fed to one<br>
continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR) of 275 gallons (1041 liters) in size used<br>
for the Alpha-portion of the calcinations. A high temperature Tube mill was used<br>
for the Beta-portion of the calcinations of the Examples. The Tube mill was a<br>
heated ball mill.<br>
CONTROL<br>
[0045] At a reactor temperature of 298 °F (148 °C), 99% of the gypsum of the<br>
feed slurry was calcined to Alpha calcium sulfate hemihydrate, which had a<br>
normal consistency of 32 to 34 cc. Normal consistencies in the Control and the<br>
following Examples were measured by the above-described hand drop test.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
[0046] At a reactor temperature of 285 "F (141 "C), 90% of the gypsum fed to the<br>
first reactor was calcined to Alpha calcium sulfate hemihydrate. The resulting<br>
slurry was filtered and the filtered solids were further calcined in the Tube mill at<br>
300 °F (149 °C). The filtered product before being fed to the Tube mill was kept<br>
at elevated temperature of 160-212 °F (71-100°C). The Tube mill converted at<br>
least a portion of the calcium sulfate dihydrate of the dewatered solids into beta<br>
calcium sulfate hemihydrate. Thus, the resulting product had 90% alpha calcium<br>
sulfate hemihydrate and 8.5%-9% beta calcium sulfate hemihydrate for a total<br>
hemihydrate yield of 98.5% or higher relative to the amount of gypsum of the<br>
feed slurry. In other words, 90% of the gypsum of the feed slurry converted to<br>
alpha calcium sulfate hemihydrate and 8.5%-9% converted to beta calcium<br>
sulfate hemihydrate. The normal consistency of the resulting product was 32 cc.<br><br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
[0047] At a reactor temperature of 280 °F (138 °C), 85% of the gypsum fed to the<br>
first reactor was calcined to alpha calcium sulfate hemihydrate. The resulting<br>
slurry was filtered and the filtered solids were further calcined in the tube mill at<br>
300 °F (149 °C). The filtered product before being fed to the Tube mill was kept<br>
at elevated temperature of 160-212 °F (71-100°C). The Tube mill converted at<br>
least a portion of the calcium sulfate dihydrate of the dewatered solids into beta<br>
calcium sulfate hemihydrate. The resulting product had 85% alpha calcium<br>
sulfate hemihydrate and 13.5%-14% beta calcium sulfate hemihydrate for a total<br>
hemihydrate yield of 98.5% or higher relative to the amount of gypsum of the<br>
feed slurry. The normal consistency of the resulting product was 34 cc.<br>
EXAMPLE 3<br>
[0048] At a reactor temperature of 275 °F (135 °C), 80% of the gypsum fed to the<br>
first reactor was calcined to alpha calcium sulfate hemihydrate. The resulting<br>
slurry was filtered and the filtered solids were further calcined in the tube mill at<br>
300 °F (149 °C). The filtered product before being fed to the Tube mill was kept<br>
at elevated temperature of 160-212 °F (71-100°C). The Tube mill converted at<br>
least a portion of the calcium sulfate dihydrate of the dewatered solids into beta<br>
calcium sulfate hemihydrate. The resulting product had 80% alpha calcium<br>
sulfate hemihydrate and 18.5%-19% beta calcium sulfate hemihydrate for a total<br>
hemihydrate yield of 98.5% or higher relative to the gypsum of the feed slurry.<br>
The normal consistency of the resulting product was 32 cc.<br>
[0049] The data shows the present inventive process has the advantage that it<br>
results in a combined alpha calcium sulfate hemihydrate and beta calcium<br>
sulfate hemihydrate product that has a normal consistency similar to that of an<br>
alpha calcium sulfate hemihydrate product.<br><br>
