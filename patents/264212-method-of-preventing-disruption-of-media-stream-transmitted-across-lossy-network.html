				<td>SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR LOST PACKET RECOVERY<br>
WITH CONGESTION AVOIDANCE<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0001]	Increasingly, videoconferencing systems have begun to use packet-<br>
switched networks, such as the Internet, rather than circuit-switched networks,<br>
such as PSTN and ISDN. One problem with the use of packet-switched networks<br>
for videoconferencing is that all packet-switched networks will experience some<br>
degree of packet loss. Video quality is signficantly impaired with even a modest<br>
packet loss.<br>
[0002]	Existing solutions to the problem of packet loss include the use of<br>
various error concealment techniques and picture refresh mechanisms. Though<br>
helpful, these techniques are often inadequate. They also are frequently integrated<br>
with specific video codecs, requiring the techniques to be re-invented for each<br>
advance in codec technology.<br>
[0003]	Packet-switched networks typically have at least two fundamental<br>
types of packet loss. Physical loss can occur when layers 1 and 2 of networks lose<br>
information that is not recovered. This type of loss is more common, for example,<br>
when radio links (e.g., WiFi networks such as 802.11a, 802.11b, 802.11g, and<br>
802.11n) are employed. However, physical layer loss can occur on wired and<br>
fiber links as well. A second type of packet loss can result from network<br>
congestion.<br>
[0004]	To overcome this second type of packet loss, some<br>
videoconferencing devices employ various techniques of congestion avoidance.<br>
One such technique is described in U.S. Patent Application 10/305,485, entitled<br>
"System and Method for Dynamic Bandwidth Allocation for Videoconferencing<br>
in Lossy Packet Switched Systems," filed November 26, 2002, which is<br>
incorporated by reference in its entirety. Such technqiues may be referred to as<br>
"Dynamic Bandwidth Allocation" or "DBA." These types of DBA algorithms<br>
inherently risk introducing packet loss whenever they attempt to increase the<br>
bandwidth, which can result in impaired media. Other types of congestion<br>
avoidance techniques include VCON's PacketAssist and other standards relating<br><br>
 to either lost packet recovery or congestion control. For instance, RFC 2733<br>
provides a method for lost packet recovery which employs XOR (parity) packets.<br>
RFC 3448 provides a method a unicast congestion control, as does RFC 4340.<br>
[0005]	Additionally, lost data recovery techniques such as forward erasure<br>
correction and forward error correction can be employed on layers 1 and 2 of<br>
networks. These techniques have also been used with stored media such as RAID<br>
disks and CDROMs/DVDs. 3GPP has recently standardized forward erasure<br>
correction. Forward error correction can also provided for video streams<br>
transmitted via H.320.<br>
[0006]	Heretofore, there has been no implementation integrating lost<br>
packet recovery (e.g., using forward erasure correction) with congestion<br>
avoidance. Described herein is an algorithm that includes such integration.<br>
 SUMMARY<br>
[0007]	In one aspect, the present invention relates to a method of<br>
preventing disruption of a media stream transmitted across a lossy network. The<br>
method can include applying a lost packet recovery algorithm to the media stream.<br>
The lost packet recovery mechanism can operate by inserting redundant<br>
information into a transmitted data stream that includes the media stream. The<br>
redundant information can be generated using forward erasure correction and/or<br>
Reed-Solomon encoding. The method can further include applying a congestion<br>
avoidance algorithm to the transmitted data stream. The congestion avoidance<br>
algorithm can include temporarily increasing a data rate of the transmitted data<br>
stream to determine whether the network can support a higher data rate. The data<br>
rate can be temporarily increased by increasing the amount of redundant<br>
information inserted into the transmitted data stream.<br>
[0008]	The present invention can also relate to a method of recovering<br>
media data received over a lossy network, wherein the media stream was<br>
transmitted as part of a data stream comprising the media stream and redundant<br>
information. The recovery method can include receiving a plurality of packets<br>
containing the media stream and the redundant information and reconstructing lost<br><br>
[0009]	The present inverition can also related to a videoconferencing device<br>
adapted to perform data recovery and congestion avoidance as described above.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0018]	Disclosed herein are techniques for overcoming the effect of lost<br>
packets in network transmission that combine the use of forward erasure<br>
correction and congestion avoidance. These techniques may be referred to as<br>
"Lost Packet Recovery" or "LPR."<br>
[0019]	LPR is a scalable method for recovery of lost RTP media packets.<br>
It is not media specific, although the examples described herein are intended for<br>
video codecs. LPR techniques described herein can also be used to protect other<br>
types of RTP media streams. LPR uses Reed-Solomon encoding to provide<br>
forward erasure correction of lost media packets, which allows for recovery of the<br><br>
[0020] When LPR is employed the RTP payload is re-packetized to create<br>
data packets of approximately equal size. The re-packetized stream uses a distinct<br>
RTP dynamic payload type (which differs from the assigned media payload<br>
number), and is fully RTP compliant. A payload-specific header includes enough<br>
information to reconstruct the original RTP packets. LPR assumes that the SSRC<br>
and CSRC information does not change in the middle of a recovery set (as defined<br>
below). Timestamps, sequence numbers, the original payload type, and the<br>
marker bit are fully recovered, which ensures that the recovered RTP stream can<br>
be decrypted.<br>
[0021]	Recovery packets are then added to this RTP stream. The recovery<br>
packets are also RTP compliant. Each recovery packet also includes a payload<br>
header that describes the protected data packets. Each packet's RTP payload<br>
includes the recovery information. The number of recovery packets added<br>
depends on the channel loss rate as estimated from RTCP receiver reports.<br>
Channel loss rates of up to about 15% can be accommodated, albeit with a bit rate<br>
overhead of about 50%.<br>
[0022]	It should be noted that the LPR protection is not considered to be<br>
part of the overall media bit rate. Only the actual compressed payload is counted<br>
as such. However, the aggregated bit rate can be reduced as necessary to avoid<br>
network congestion. It should be understood that network congestion can have<br>
undesirable affects other than or in addition to packet loss. For example, network<br>
congestion can cause increased media latency and dropped connections (including<br>
signaling connections). Therefore, the LPR protocol can have built-in messages<br>
for congestion avoidance. One suitable congestion avoidance algorithm is<br>
described in greater detail below, although a variety of congestion avoidance<br>
algorithms may be used.<br>
[0023]	An example of LPR applied to a media stream will now be<br>
described with reference to Figs. 1-3. The details of the example, including bit<br>
rates, packet loss rates, packet sizes, ratio of data packets to recovery packets, etc.<br>
are all mere examples and can vary depending on implementation details, channel<br>
conditions, etc.<br><br>
[0024] Consider a 300 kbps video channel that has a packet loss rate of<br>
2%. Three packets 101, 102, and 103 are to be transmitted. An LPR mode of<br>
(6+2) can be used, meaning that two recovery packets 104, 105 will be inserted<br>
into each group of six data packets 106-111, creating recovery sets of eight<br>
packets each. The recovery packets 104, 105 are about equal in size to the largest<br>
data packet, but include some additional overhead. The recovery packets allow<br>
regeneration of any two of the six data packets 106-111 as described in greater<br>
detail below.<br>
[0025]	To stay within the 300 kbps channel limit, the media rate can be<br>
reduced to approximately 220 kbps, leaving 80 kbps for the recovery packets.<br>
The target size for each re-packetized data packet can be 500 bytes. Each<br>
recovery set therefore carries about 32000 bits of information, representing a time<br>
period of 107 ms at the channel rate of 300 kbps. The 107 ms period is called the<br>
protection period.<br>
[0026]	Each of the packets (i.e., the re-packetized data packets 106-111<br>
and the recovery packets 104, 105) contains the normal 40 bytes of IP+UDP+RTP<br>
header overhead. For simplicity, this overhead is not shown. However, the<br>
overhead associated with LPR itself is shown. For example, "3+420" indicates<br>
that three overhead bytes plus 420 bytes of the original data are in the packet. The<br>
recovery packets are 100% overhead. The details of the overhead are described in<br>
greater detail below.<br>
[0027]	Figure 2 illustrates the recovery process. Assume that data packets<br>
3 and 5 (108, 110) are lost. The LPR decoder creates regenerated packets 201 and<br>
202 from the six packets that were received, i.e., data packets 1, 2, 4, and 6 and<br>
recovery packets 1 and 2. Note that regeneration of the lost packets cannot occur<br>
until the sixth packet is received. After regeneration, the original RTP packets<br>
203-205 are restored from the data packets. Regeneration of the lost packets is<br>
described in greater detail below.<br>
[0028]	Figure 3 illustrates a failed packet recovery where more than two<br>
packets are lost. In this example Recovery Packet 1 is lost as well as Data Packets<br>
3 and 5. Since only 5 packets of the group were received, packet regeneration is<br><br>
packet can not be recovered in its entirety, then the partial packet information is<br>
discarded. Therefore, data packets 1 and 2, 301, 302 are both shown as lost.<br>
[0029]	In the event that all of the original data packets cannot be<br>
recovered, as illustrated in Fig. 3, it is typical for the receiving decoder to request<br>
a fast update of the entire image. Alternatively, a walk-around refresh such as that<br>
described in U.S. Patent 7,020,203, entitled "Dynamic Intra-coded Macroblock<br>
Refresh Interval for Video Error Concealment," issued March 28, 2006, which is<br>
hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. In either case, the time required<br>
to repair the image is not a function of the number of packets lost, but rather the<br>
mean time between failures caused by losing more than the predetermined number<br>
of packets in the recovery set (two, in this example).<br>
[0030]	For the given example of a channel at 300 kbps and 2% packet<br>
loss, with each protection set of six data packets and two recovery data packets<br>
covering 107 ms of channel data, the mean time between failures can be computed<br>
to be approximately 258 seconds. Assuming that a fast update requires<br>
approximately two seconds, the video transmitted on a channel protected by the<br>
LPR example given will be error-free more than 99% of the time. This protection<br>
comes at an additional overhead of 80 kbps, which is approximately 30% of the<br>
channel rate.<br>
[0031]	Additional aspects of the LPR example given above may be better<br>
understood with reference to Fig. 4, which illustrates an implementation of an<br>
LPR encoder. Variations of this implementation are also possible. Video encoder<br>
401 can be any of a variety of video encoders operating in a more or less<br>
conventional matter. For example, the video encoder can operate according to the<br>
H.261, H.263, H.264, MPEG-2, or MPEG-4 video compression standards.<br>
Alternatively, the video encoder can operate according to any of a variety of<br>
proprietary video coding techniques.<br>
[0032]	The output of video encoder 401 can be supplied to optional<br>
encryption module 402, which can also be of any of a variety of known types.<br>
The encrypted video data (or unencrypted video data, if encryption is not used)<br>
can be supplied to RTP sender 403, which can also be conventional. The RTP<br><br>
 algorithem by LPR packetizer 406 as described in greater detail below. LPR<br>
recovery packet generator 407 can then generate the recovery packets based on<br>
information received from LPR packetizer 406 and video encoder 401, as<br>
described in greater detail below. The LPR recovery packet generator can then<br>
transmit the LPR data packets and the LPR recovery packets to the receiver (not<br>
shown).<br>
[0033]	RTCP module 404 can receive packet loss and other channel<br>
statistics and supply these to LPR mode decision module 405, which controls LPR<br>
packetizer 406. LPR mode decision module 405 can decide whether to engage or<br>
disengage LPR protection, as well as determine the LPR protection parameters to<br>
be used. If LPR protection is disengaged, LPR packetizer 406 and LPR recovery<br>
packet generator 407 can pass through the RTP packets generated by RTP sender<br>
403 without alteration.<br>
[0034]	LPR mode decision module 405 can operate as follows. First the<br>
protection period (as described above) can be determined. Longer protection<br>
periods offer more efficient packet regeneration (e.g., fewer recovery kbps), but<br>
create more latency. For most typical videoconferencing bit rates, 100 ms can be<br>
a suitable protection period. At bit rates below 128 Kbps longer protection periods<br>
might be necessary. For example, 150 ms can be suitable for a 64 Kbps rate. At<br>
bit rates above 1 Mbps shorter protection periods might be advantageous. For<br>
example, 50 ms can be suitable for rates of 2 Mbps or more. Other parameters can<br>
also be considered in determining the protection period.<br>
[0035]	Next, the number of total packets per protection period can be<br>
determined. In general, small numbers of packets per protection period may tend<br>
to decrease the efficiency of the protection. Conversely, larger numbers of<br>
packets per protection period may tend to increase the amount of computation<br>
required to encode and decode the protection packets. Therefore, for most<br>
channels, about thirteen or more packets per protection period is believed to be<br>
suitable. The decision on the number of packets per protection period should also<br>
take into account the resulting packet size for the desired data rate. The output<br>
packet size (including IP overhead) should be less than 1260 bytes to traverse an<br><br>
the number of recovery packets per protection period can be chosen. The number<br>
of recovery packets can be chosen (using conventional probabilistic analysis<br>
techniques) so that the mean time between protection breakdowns meets or<br>
exceeds a predetermined specified value. Additionally, the aggregation of all<br>
transmitted video channels (including the LPR protection packets and RTP<br>
messages) can be selected so as not to exceed a specified congestion ceiling.<br>
[0037]	The tables below give example protection modes that can be used<br>
for various bitrates under various loss conditions. Table 1 gives LPR parameters<br>
that may be suitable for 4% packet loss conditions that can be used in conjunction<br>
with congestion avoidance algorithms (as described below) that reduce the data<br>
rate when packet loss exceeds 3%. Table 2 gives LPR parameters for 2% packet<br>
loss conditions that may be used when congestion avoidance algorithms are not in<br>
use.<br><br><br><br>
[0038]	LPR packetizer 406 can operate as follows. LPR packetizer 406<br>
sub-divides the original media packets generated by RTP sender 403 so as to<br>
improve the efficiency of packet regeneration coding. An LPR data packet<br>
contains information from only one source packet. If the media channel is<br>
encrypted, LPR re-packetization can be performed on the encrypted stream. In<br>
general, the LPR stream itself is not re-encrypted, i.e., the LPR encapsulation<br>
fields (headers) added to the encrypted packets and newly generated LPR<br>
recovery packets are sent in the clear.<br>
[0039]	If an original source packet is sub-divided (e.g., Packet 1 101 in<br>
Figs. 1-3), the first LPR data packet for this source packet is called the initial data<br>
packet (e.g., Data 1 106 in Figs. 1-3). Subsequent data packets (if any) are called<br>
follow-on data packets (e.g., Data 2 107 and Data 3 108 in Figs. 1-3). The<br>
number of follow-on data packets is signaled in the initial data packet and<br>
therefore cannot be changed once the initial data packet is sent. The follow-on<br>
data packets and the initial data packet may be in different LPR protection groups.<br>
[0040]	All fields in the original RTP header except for the sequence<br>
number, the payload type, and the P field can be carried unchanged in each LPR<br>
data packet. This includes the time stamp, the marker bit, and the SSRC/CSRC<br>
information. The payload number can be replaced with the negotiated LPR<br>
payload type. Sequence numbers can be assigned sequentially to the LPR media<br>
stream in the usual fashion. The P field of the LPR packet can be set to 0. LPR<br>
packetizer 406 can pass through the original RTP sequence numbers to LPR<br>
recovery packet generator 407.<br>
[0041]	Each initial data packet can include a seven-byte payload header<br>
that is specific to LPR, an example of which is illustrated in Fig. 5. Each follow-<br>
on data packet can include a three-byte payload header, an example of which is<br><br>
 header and precede the video (or other media) payload. The header sizes and<br>
individual field sizes and their arrangement are exemplary only, and it will be<br>
understood that other arrangements are possible.<br>
[0042]	The recovery packet field 501, 601 can be used to indicate the<br>
number of recovery packets that will subsequently be sent in the recovery set. All<br>
data packets in a recovery set should signal the same number of recovery packets.<br>
The number of recovery packets signaled can be 0, indicating that no recovery<br>
packets will be sent. This field can be a six-bit field, which would allow for up to<br>
sixty-four recovery packets. The type field 502, 602 can be a two-bit field set to<br>
either 00 or 01 to indicate an initial data packet or a follow-on data packet,<br>
respectively. This allows the header type for LPR to be determined by examining<br>
the first payload byte.<br>
[0043]	Data index field 503, 603 can be an 8-bit field. The first data<br>
packet in a recovery set can be assigned a data index of 1. The index can be<br>
incremented for subsequent data packets in the set. The follow-on packets field<br>
504 can be an 8-bit field used to specify the number of follow-on packets<br>
associated with the initial packet. The data packet field 604 can be an eight-bit<br>
field used to signal the number of data packets included in the recovery set. All<br>
data packets should signal the same number of data packets.<br>
[0044]	Original sequence field 505 can be a sixteen-bit field that indicates<br>
the original RTP packet sequence number, which will be used to recreate the<br>
original RTP packets. Original p-bit field 506 can be a one-bit field used to carry<br>
the padding bit carried by the original RTP packet. Original payload type field<br>
507 can be a seven-bit field used to carry the payload type as carried by the<br>
original RTP packet.<br>
[0045]	LPR recovery packet generator 407 can operate as follows. LPR<br>
recovery packet generator 407 can replace the RTP sequence numbers of the<br>
original media with the final LPR sequence numbers in the LPR data packets.<br>
LPR recovery packet generator 407 can also inserts the LPR recovery packets at<br>
the end of each recovery set.<br>
[0046]	Each recovery packet can also include a nine-byte header such as<br><br>
RTP header and can Precede the video (or other media) payload. 	As	with the<br>
header described above, the field types and sizes are exemplary and other<br>
arrangements may also be used.<br>
[0047]	Recovery index field 701 can be a six-bit field used to indicate the<br>
sequence of the recovery packet in the recovery set. The first recovery packet can<br>
be assigned a recovery index of 1, which can be incremented for subsequent<br>
recovery packets in the recovery set. Type field 702 can be a two-bit field set to<br>
10 to indicate the packet is a recovery packet. The recovery packets field can be<br>
an eight-bit field that includes the number of data packets in the recovery set. All<br>
recovery packets should signal the same number of recovery packets signalled by<br>
the corresponding data packets. Data packets field 704 can be an eight-bit field<br>
that indicates the number of data packets sent in the recovery set. The recovery<br>
packets should indicate the same number of data packets indicated in the<br>
corresponding data packets.<br>
[0048]	Protected timestamps field 705 can be a 32 bit field that holds<br>
Reed-Solomon encoded RTP timestamps for each data packet in the recovery set.<br>
This can combined using the same Reed-Solomon encoding as used in the<br>
recovery payload itself. This field can allow the RTP timestamp of a missing data<br>
packet to be regenerated. The 4 bytes are in network order.<br>
[0049]	Protected marker, flag, and size field 706 (futher illustrated in Fig.<br>
8) can hold the Reed-Solomon encoded RTP marker bit 802, a flag value 801, and<br>
data packet size 803. The flag value can be 1 if the LPR data packet is an initial<br>
packet, and can be set to 0 if the LPR data packet is a follow-on packet. The size<br>
can include the IP, UDP, and RTP header as well as the LPR header. The data<br>
packet size can be in network order.<br>
[0050]	The protected field is combined using the same Reed-Solomon<br>
encoding as is used in the recovery payload itself. The field allows the LPR<br>
header type, marker and data packet size to be regenerated for any missing data<br>
packet that can be recovered.<br>
[0051]	The payload of the recovery packet can be encoded using Reed-<br>
Solomon 256 (RS256) encoding. The Original Sequence 505, Original P bit 506,<br><br>
packet can be protected as if they were payload bytes. This can allow thi<br>
information to be recovered if the initial data packet is lost. Additionally, the<br>
recovery packet payload header can include encodings of three Phantom Data<br>
fields: the length of the data packet itself, the marker bit, and the timestamp.<br>
Again, this can allow this information to be recovered if all data packets for a sub-<br>
divided RTP packet are lost.<br>
[0052]	Each payload byte in each data packet can contribute to the<br>
corresponding byte in each recovery packet, according to the generating function<br>
for RS256: <br>
where: Di is the ith data packet (1≤i≤d); Rj is theyth recovery packet (1≤J≤r); Bi is<br>
the ith base coefficient (1≤i≤d) having values as specified in table 3; and<br>
B1f-1, are computed using Galois Field (28) arithmetic operations as<br>
described below. It should be noted that the given base coefficient table restricts<br>
the maximum number of data packets in a recovery set to 128, although other<br>
numbers of data packets can be selected, and a suitable table can be computed<br>
accordingly.<br><br><br>
[0053]Galois field (28) arothmetic operations can be set up bto use two<br>
helper tables: a Galois Log function (glog) table, and a Galois Exponentiation<br>
function (gexp) table. These tables are:<br><br><br><br><br><br>
These tables can then be used to compute various arithmetic opeations as<br>
described below.<br>
[0054]	Addition and subtraction in Galois Field (28) are the same<br>
operation, and are performed as follows:<br>
ab =ab<br>
α-b=ab<br>
where  is the logical exclusive or (XOR) operator. As in ordinary arithmetic,<br>
a0 = 0a =a.<br>
[0055]	Multiplication (a  b) in Galois Field (28) is performed as<br>
follows:<br>
a  b = gexp[glog[a] + glog[b]]<br>
where + is the ordinary addition operator. As in ordinary arithmetic, a  0 =<br>
0  a = 0. Also, a  1 = 1  a = a.<br>
[0056]	Division (a  b) in Galois Field (28) is performed as follows:<br>
a  b = gexp[glog[a] - glog[b] + 255]<br><br>
where + is the ordinary addition operator and is the ordinary subtraction<br>
operator. As in ordinary arithmetic, a +1 = a. As is also usual, b must be non-<br>
zero.<br>
[0057]	The power function (ab) in Galois Field (28) is performed as<br>
follows:<br>
ab = gexp[(glog[a] * b) % OxFF]<br>
where + is the ordinary addition operator, - is the ordinary subtraction operator, *<br>
is the ordinary multiplication operator, and % is the ordinary mod function. As in<br>
ordinary arithmetic, a0 = 1 for non-zero a. In the RS256 reference code, 0 is never<br>
raised to a power.<br>
[0058]	As described above, the LPR group size (in packets) can be set to<br>
achieve a desired protection period (in milliseconds),. If the video codec does not<br>
use the entire channel bit rate, then the LPR group will result in a longer latency<br>
period. For example, a video channel that normally runs at 1.5 Mbps may drop to<br>
750 Kbps in periods of light motion. This could result in a protection period twice<br>
as long as desired. Such a situation can result in the selected LPR mode<br>
continuing to meet the predetermined MTBF, which will, in this example, be<br>
exceeded by a factor of 2.<br>
[0059]	In some cases, this extended protection period can be allowed.<br>
However, this can result in a longer latency when packets are lost. Therefore, in<br>
some cases, it may be desirable for the transmitter to adjust its LPR mode as the<br>
actual video rate varies. Three such adjustments are described below, although<br>
other adjustments are also possible.<br>
[0060]	One adjustment that can be made is to the protection group size. In<br>
some embodiments, this setting can be changed at every protection group<br>
boundary. Therefore, a transmitter can monitor the LPR output packet rate and<br>
dynamically adapt the number of packets per group. When this adjustment is<br>
employed, LPR protection overhead will tend to rise as the data rate falls.<br>
However, because the data rate in such cases will typically be below the normal<br>
limit the altered LPR mode will still generally remain below a predetermined<br>
congestion ceiling<br><br>
[0061] Another adjustment that can be made is for the transmitter to<br>
change its output packet size upon transmission of an initial data packet. In<br>
general the transmitter should not change the output packet size when transmitting<br>
follow-on packets, as the number of follow-on packets will typically be signaled<br>
in the initial data packet. Therefore, a transmitter can monitor the LPR output<br>
packet rate and the output data rate and dynamically adapt the packet size to<br>
maintain the number of packets per protection period.<br>
[0062]	Another adjustment that can be made is for the transmitter to send<br>
empty data packets to complete a partial recovery set. An empty data packet can<br>
include an initial data packet header as described above. Other information that<br>
would normally be in the packet, such as sequence number payload type, number<br>
of follow-on packets, etc., can all be set to zero. Because the empty data packets<br>
are part of the protection group, the recovery packet encoding described above can<br>
include these packets, which can also be recovered by the decoding process. Also,<br>
empty data packets can be discarded by the LPR decoder (discussed below) to<br>
prevent empty packets in the output media packet stream.<br>
[0063]	Fill packets can also be used to maintain a predetermined data rate.<br>
These fill packets can be discarded by the receiver. An example fill packet is<br>
illustrated in Fig. 9. The fill packet can include an extended type field 901 of six<br>
. bits having a value of 1 and a type field 902 of two bits having a value of 11. The<br>
fill packet can be an RTP packet using the LPR payload type for the media stream.<br>
The timestamp value can be the same as the value in the previously sent RTP<br>
packet. The sequence number can be incremented from the value in the<br>
previously sent packet. The payload can end with the Fill header shown above.<br>
The payload length of the field can be any length within a maximum specified<br>
packet size.<br>
[0064]	An example of an LPR decoder is illustrated in Fig. 10. As with<br>
the LPR encoder discussed above, variations on this embodiment are possible.<br>
Operation of the LPR decoder can be basically an inverse of the LPR encoder<br>
operation described above. Specifically, LPR packets can be recovered by LPR<br>
recovery module 1001. These recovered LPR packets can be passed to the RTP<br><br>
ino their received order. LPR regenerator 1003 can then recreate any lost<br>
packets, relying on information received from the recovered LPR packets (from<br>
LPR recovery block 1001) and RTCP information received from RTCP module<br>
1006. These regenerated blocks can then be decrypted by decryption block 1004<br>
(if encryption was used at the source), and finally the decrypted blocks can be<br>
processed by video decoder 1005 (or other type of media decoder, as appropriate).<br>
[0065]	LPR recovery module 1001 and LPR renenerator 1003 can be the<br>
only non-standard elements as compared to conventional systems, and these two<br>
modules can operate as pass-throughs when LPR is not being used.<br>
[0066]	LPR recovery module 1001 can process all LPR RTP packets. In<br>
the given example, all received and regenerated packets (data and recovery) can<br>
be directly passed through to the RTP reordering buffer. The overhead data in<br>
each data packet can allow these packets to be processed by LPR recovery module<br>
1001 in any order. LPR recovery module 1001 can also provide LPR RTP<br>
receiver report information to RTCP module 1006. This information can be based<br>
on what is received (e.g., any packets that are not recovered can be identified as<br>
lost in the receiver report).<br>
[0067]	If there are missing data packets in the recovery set that can be<br>
recovered, the LPR recovery module can recover these packets as soon as<br>
sufficient recovery packets have been received. As discussed above, if k data<br>
packets are missing, k recovery packets must be received to recover the data. This<br>
recovery process can involve first recovering the marker bit, the data packet<br>
length, the initial packet flag, and the original timestamp. The data packet length<br>
can be used to recover the original data packet payload. "Fixed" components of<br>
the LPR RTP header (e.g., SSRC, CSRC, LPR payload type, etc.) can be taken<br>
from one of the recovery packets. Variable portions of the LPR RTP header (e.g.,<br>
marker bit, timestamp, and sequence number) can be set to the values recovered<br>
from the recovery header.<br>
[0068]	The sequence number for LPR data packet i can be computed<br>
according to the following equation:<br>
Si=Sr-(d + r-i)<br><br>
wher: i is the index recovered data packet, d is the number of data packets in the<br>
recovery set, r is a received recovery packet index, and St is the sequence number<br>
for packet i.<br>
[0069]	While receiving data packets, partial recovery packets can be built<br>
up by recovery module 1001, using the RS256 generation function described<br>
above. As corresponding recovery packets for the set are received, these packets<br>
can be exclusive-or'ed (i.e., XOR'd) with the partial recovery packet. The<br>
resulting residual packets will hold the contribution of any lost data packets to<br>
each recovery packet. In the exemplary system, each residual packet will be a<br>
linear combination of each of the missing data packets. Thus, there will be k<br>
simultaneous equations (one for each of the k residual packets), each with k<br>
unknowns (one for each of the missing k data packets).<br>
[0070]	As would be understood by one skilled in the art, these equations<br>
can be represented as a k x k matrix, which can then be solved numerically, e.g.,<br>
by Gaussian elimination. Because such operations are well-known, the details are<br>
not reproduced herein. Multiplying the resulting inverted matrix by the residual<br>
data can then recover the missing data packets.<br>
[0071]	To illustrate the above recovery process, the recovery scenario in<br>
Figure 2 can be performed. For clarity ordinary arithmetic operations are used<br>
rather than the actual Galois Field (28) operations. The data in the recovery<br>
packets can generated using the following formula (derived from the RS256<br>
generation function and tables described above:<br>
R1, = Dl + D2 + D3 + D4 + D5 + D6<br>
R2 = 2D1 + 4D2 + 6D3 + 9D4 +13D5 + 14D6<br>
[0072]	The partial recovery packets can be computed by the decoder on<br>
the packets that are received. As noted in the example above, packets 3 and 4<br>
(108, 110, Fig. 3) are not received. This results in:<br>
Pl=D1+D2+D5+D6<br>
P2 = 2D1 + 4D2 +13D5 + 14D6<br>
Residuals can be computed by subtracting the partial recovery packets from the<br>
received recovery packets:<br><br>
r1=R2-P2 =D3+D1<br>
r2=R2-P2 =6D3+9D1<br>
The generating matrix for the residuals is therefore:<br>
1 1<br>
6	9<br>
Inverting this matrix via Gaussian elimination results in the following:<br>
3	-1/3<br>
-2	1/3<br>
Therefore, the information in the missing data packets (i.e., data packets 3 and 4)<br>
can be recovered using the formulas:<br>
D3 =3r1-r2/3<br>
D4 =2r1-r2/3<br>
[0073]	When LPR is in use, RTP reordering buffer 1002 can be integrated<br>
with the LPR decoder. This can permit a minimal delay implementation, because<br>
in some situations out-of-order packets can be regenerated by LPR before they<br>
actually arrive. Additionally, in some embodiments it may be desirable to acquire<br>
the first d packets of the recovery set, running the Reed-Solomon decoder only if<br>
some data packets were lost. This design may not produce minimal delay, but can<br>
be more computationally efficient.<br>
[0074]	LPR regenerator module 1003 can recreate the original RTP stream<br>
from the data packets as was described above. If some data packets for an RTP<br>
packet are missing, then that RTP packet is omitted from the output stream.<br>
Because the LPR stream has been re-ordered, the initial packet from each packet<br>
set should be received first. If a follow-on packet is encountered first, then the<br>
initial packet has been lost, and the follow-on packet can be discarded.<br>
[0075]	The output RTP packet uses the RTP header information of the<br>
initial data packet. The payload type, sequence number, and timestamp are<br>
replaced with the values in the initial data header. The payload is aggregated from<br>
the initial packet and any follow-on data packets with the LPR headers removed.<br>
If any follow-on packets are missing the output RTP packet can be suppressed. It<br>
should be noted that the number of follow-on packets can be known because it can<br>
be signaled in the initial data packet header.<br><br>
[0076] Lost packet recovery techniques, like those described above, can be<br>
combined with congestion avoidance algorithms to further enhance operation. An<br>
example congestion avoidance algorithm is referenced above and is referred to as<br>
Dynamic Bandwidth Allocation ("DBA"). DBA can attempt to avoid congestion<br>
by downspeeding the bitrate based on the percent packet loss reported by the<br>
receiver's RTP stack (1006, Fig. 10). The receiver RTP stack generates packet<br>
loss statistics for the receiver channel during regular time periods (e.g., every 200<br>
ms). This can allow fast adaptation to a dynamically changing pipe while<br>
allowing for minimal LPR configurations with low MTBF requirements (which,<br>
in turn can allow for lower overhead).<br>
[0077]	As illustrated in Fig. 12, the control loop for DBA can be<br>
implemented as a state machine with the following states: max rate state 1101,<br>
downspeeding state 1102, upspeed wait state 1103, upspeeding state 1104, and<br>
constant loss state 1105. The various state transitions can be understood as<br>
follows. Suppose the system is in the max rate state 1101, meaning that the<br>
maximum data rate is being used. A packet loss above a predetermined threshold<br>
can cause state transition 1106 to downspeeding state 1102.<br>
[0078]	While in the downspeeding state, the system can decrease the<br>
speed and wait to see whether packet loss above the predetermined threshold<br>
continues to be experienced. If there is no more packet loss above the threshold,<br>
the system can follow transition 1108 to the upspeed wait state. If there continues<br>
to be packet loss above the threshold, and the maximum number of downspeed<br>
attempts have not been used (block 1107), the system can continue in the<br>
downspeeding state 1102 and can thus continue decreasing the bitrate. If the<br>
maximum number of downspeeding attempts has been used, the system can<br>
transition to constant loss state 1105.<br>
[0079]	While in the upspeed wait state, additional packet loss above the<br>
predetermined threshold can cause the system to follow transition 1109 to the<br>
downspeeding state. Alternatively, if, after a predetermined period of time, there<br>
is no packet loss above the threshold, the system can follow transition 1110 to the<br>
upspeeding state 1104.<br><br>
[0080] In the upspeeding state 1104, the system can increase the bitrate<br>
and wait for additional packet loss above the predetermined threshold. If there is<br>
no packet loss, the system can determine whether the bitrate is less than the<br>
maximum bitrate. If so, the system can follow state transition 1111 to the<br>
maximum rate state 1101. If not, the system can continue in the upspeed state<br>
1104. If packet loss above the predetermined threshold is experienced while in<br>
upspeed state 1104, the system can determine whether a predetermined maximum<br>
number of upspeed attempts have been made (block 1112). If not, the system can<br>
follow transition 1113 to the upspeed wait state. If the maximum number of<br>
upspeed attempts has been used, the system can follow transition 1114 to the max<br>
rate state 1101.<br>
[0081]	In each of the states described above, different packet loss<br>
thresholds may be employed. Additionally, some or all state transitions may have<br>
a delay associated with them. Upspeeds can be done in 15% step increases of the<br>
bit rate. If the pipe is fully utilized and no packet loss is reported, a delay can be<br>
incurred which can be equal to X timer cycles (200 ms * X) before the next<br>
upspeed will occur. By default the value of X can be set to 2, resulting in a 400<br>
ms delay. Any packet loss that is not a sequential packet loss report and not an<br>
echo report can cause a state transition.<br>
[0082]	Figure 12 shows dynamically changing bandwidth availability and<br>
the DBA adaptation. Figure 12 also shows the state transitions, echo delays, along<br>
with three generalized loss scenarios: Burst Loss, Constrained Pipe, and Constant<br>
Loss. LPR protection use is designated in Figure 12 by the shaded area during the<br>
downspeeding state, the upspeed wait state, and the upspeeding state. The<br>
upspeed attempts can use the LPR protection overhead to test for the congestion<br>
ceiling, i.e., only "redundant" data may be used to probe whether network<br>
congestion conditions would permit a higher bitrate. If this test of the congestion<br>
ceiling fails, LPR protects any loss caused by the packet loss incurred because<br>
only "redundant" data has been used. This allows probing of the congestion<br>
ceiling with substantially reduced risk of video disruption.<br>
[0083]	The measured congestion ceiling can be applied to the data flow in<br><br>
congestion ceiling can apply to the aggregated bit rate. Forward erasure<br>
protection can be applied independently to each video stream. However, the same<br>
level of protection can be applied to all streams. The system can also be adapted<br>
to jointly protect the video streams with common forward erasure protection<br>
packets or to apply different levels of protection to each video stream.<br>
[0084]	Forward erasure correction can also be applied to just a part of the<br>
video stream. For instance, in cases where layered video encoding is employed,<br>
the forward erasure protection could be applied to the base layer but not the<br>
enhancement layers. It could also be adapted to protect the various layers to<br>
different degrees (so called "unequal protection"). In these configurations, the<br>
congestion avoidance applies to the entire data flow.<br>
[0085]	Example LPR probes for congestion ceiling management are given<br>
in Table 6. These probes can be used to test the possibility of raising the data rate<br>
by a predetermined value (e.g.", 10%) and can be activated for short periods of<br>
time (e.g., 800 ms).<br><br>
[0086]	The techniques described herein can be receiver-driven, in that the<br>
receiver feeds back the congestion ceiling and erasure protection level to the<br>
sender. Alternatively, they can also be used in a transmitter-driven framework, or<br>
even in a hybrid framework where the control loop is distributed between sender<br>
and receiver. With some adaptation, it is also suitable for use with multicast<br><br>
streams. The techniques described also can be combined with other techniques<br>
such as packet retransmission, periodic picture refresh, and video error<br>
concealment.<br>
[0087]	As described above, the combination of forward erasure correction<br>
with congestion avoidance offers unique benefits that neither mechanism can<br>
achieve on its own. One such benefit is that congestion ceiling can be periodically<br>
measured by experimentally increasing the amount of forward erasure protection<br>
packets in the bitstream and observing the effect on the delivered data flow.<br>
These protection packets increase the overall data rate to a desired "probe" level<br>
while simultaneously protecting the media from packet loss (in case the level<br>
exceeds the congestion ceiling). A second benefit is that this method of<br>
dynamically measuring the congestion ceiling can result in a much faster<br>
determination of the allowable bandwidth than that provided by the passive<br>
methods normally employed in congestion avoidance algorithms. A third benefit<br>
is that the protected media flow can be delivered with less delay and lower<br>
protection overhead when the entire flow (media and protection) is constrained to<br>
stay below the dynamically measured congestion ceiling.<br>
[0088]	An additional benefit of the techniques described herein arises in<br>
that as the video data rate increases, the system can become more and more<br>
efficient at protecting against packet loss. Therefore, as bitrates increase, such as<br>
with the use of high definition video, the techniques described herein become both<br>
more useful and more efficient.<br>
[0089]	The integration of congestion avoidance with forward erasure<br>
correction offers several unique advantages. For example, congestion avoidance<br>
brings several unique advantages to forward erasure correction. As a data link<br>
becomes congested, the transmission delay for media along that link increases.<br>
Using forward erasure correction alone may result in an acceptable packet loss<br>
rate, but will not reduce queueing delays. Integrating congestion avoidance into<br>
the control loop results can achieve a desired quality of service (QoS) with much<br>
lower latency. Additionally, the efficiency of forward erasure protection is less<br>
for low-latency applications than it is for high-latency applications. If the source<br><br>
of the data loss is simple congestion, reducing the bit rate can be more efficient<br>
than adding additional forward erasure protection packets to the data flow.<br>
[0090]	Conversely, forward erasure correction can also add considerable<br>
value to congestion avoidance alone. Congestion avoidance techniques typically<br>
reduce the rate of the data flow more aggressively then they raise it. For example,<br>
the congestion mechanism for TCP reduces the data rate by a multiplicative<br>
factor, but raises it much more slowly by applying an additive factor. The reason<br>
for this is that increasing the data flow rate always risks creating congestion, and<br>
therefore creating packet loss. When forward erasure protection is integrated with<br>
the congestion avoidance, this risk is greatly reduced. Thus, as noted above, the<br>
data rate can be increased by simply increasing the density of forward erasure<br>
protection packets.<br>
[0091]	Additionally, congestion avoidance techniques also are designed to<br>
estimate the link speed. Cross-congestion from other data flows can frequently<br>
result in packet loss. By the time the cross-congestion is observed, packet loss has<br>
usually already occurred. Including forward erasure protection allows packets lost<br>
due to such cross-congestion to be recovered.<br>
[0092]	The techniques disclosed herein can be employed in a wide variety<br>
of systems, including any systems for the transmission of multimedia data, such as<br>
video data, audio data, still image data, and other types of data. Such techniques<br>
can be employed in typical general purpose computer systems, such as desktop<br>
computers, notebook computers, handheld computers, servers, and the like.<br>
Alternatively, these techniques can be employed in various appliance-type<br>
systems such as conference room videoconferencing systems, desktop<br>
videoconferencing systems, and the like. The techniques described can also be<br>
employed in infrastructure type videoconferencing devices such as multi-point<br>
control units (MCUs), bridges, media servers, etc.<br>
[0093]	The methods described herein can be coded into one or more<br>
computer programs and stored on a computer-readable media, such as a compact<br>
disk, a tape, stored in a volatile or non-volatile memory, etc. Accordingly,<br>
instructions stored on a program storage device can be used to cause a<br><br>
techniques disclosed herein. Although the disclosed communcation system has<br>
been described as providing bi-directional communication between a near end and<br>
a far end, it will be appreciated that the teachings of the present disclosure are<br>
applicable to systems that provide one-way transmission.<br>

11.	The media encoding apparatus of claim 8 wherein each LPR data packet<br>
contains information from only one source packet.<br>
12.	The media encoding apparatus of claim 8 wherein a payload of the<br>
recovery packet is encoded using Reed-Solomon encoding.<br>
13.	A method of determining LPR protection parameters in a media<br>
conference conducted over a packet-based network, the method<br>
comprising:<br>
determining a protection period;<br>
determining a total number of packets per protection period; and<br>
determining a number of recovery packets per protection period.<br>
14.	The method of claim 13 wherein the protection period is determined<br>
according to a bitrate of the media conference.<br>
15.	The method of claim 3 further comprising adjusting LPR protection<br>
parameters as a function of the media rate.<br>
16.	The method of claim 15 wherein adjusting LPR protection parameters as a<br>
function of the media rate comprises dynamically adapting the number of<br>
packets per group.<br>
17.	The method of claim 15 wherein adjusting LPR protection parameters as a<br>
function of the media rate comprises dynamically adapting the packet size.<br>
18.	The method of claim 15 wherein adjusting LPR protection parameters as a<br>
function of the media rate comprises sending empty data packets.<br><br>
19.	A media decoding apparatus for receiving media data from a transmitter<br>
over a network, the media decoding apparatus comprising:<br>
an LPR recovery module coupled to receive LPR packets, including<br>
LPR data packets and LPR recovery packets, from the network;<br>
an LPR regenerator adapted to receive the LPR data packets and<br>
regenerate any missing data packets ;<br>
an RTCP module communicatively coupled to the LPR regenerator to<br>
receive a report of lost packets from the LPR regenerator and<br>
transmit lost packet information to the transmitter; and<br>
a media decoder coupled to the LPR regenerator and adapted to receive<br>
the LPR data packets and the regenerated data packets and decode<br>
media information contained therein.<br>
20.	The media decoding apparatus of claim 19 wherein the media decoder is a<br>
video decoder.<br>
21.	The media decoding apparatus of claim 19 wherein the LPR recovery<br>
module and the LPR regenerator operate as pass throughs when LPR<br>
algorithms are not in use.<br><br>
Devices and techniques for overcoming lost packets and avoiding<br>
congestion when conducting media conferences over packet switched networks<br>
are described herein. To avoid the problem of lost packets, redundant information<br>
is inserted into the media stream that permits the receiver to reconstruct any lost<br>
packets from the redundant information. Congestion avoidance techniques<br>
include adjusting the bitrate of the media stream to find the highest bitrate that can<br>
be supported without packet loss due to congestion. When increasing the bitrate<br>
to a higher rate, the additional bits can come from the redundant information used<br>
for lost packet recovery so that any lost packets caused by network congestion<br>
will not adversely affect the bitstream.</td>
