COMPLETE SPECIFICATION (See Section 10, rule 13)<br>
A DOUBLE LOCKING PADLOCK.<br>
GODREJ &amp; BOYCE MFG. CO. LTD. of LOCKS DIVISION PLANT-18, PIROJSHANAGAR, VIKHROLI, MUMBAI - 400 079 MAHARASHTRA, India, a INDIAN National Company<br>
The following specification particularly describes the<br>
nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be<br>
performed : -	<br>
GRANTED<br>
							20-2-2004<br><br><br>
The invention relates to a Double Locking Padlock. More particularly the invention relates to a locking mechanism for a Double Locking Padlock with added security which lock the shackle at both the ends in its locking position thereby making it difficult for pry-opening by jimmying or similar device.<br>
In conventional Double Locking Padlocks there are two independent laterally sliding locking bolts, which engages in the slots provided on both ends of the shackle. If excessive force is applied on the shackle in locked condition of the padlock, a possibility exists for these bolts to slide backward and deflect a little so as to allow the shackle to come out, this type of conventional double locking mechanism is insecure. Therefore there is a need to provide more secured Double Locking Padlocks.<br>
The principle object of this invention is to provide a Double Locking Padlock with restricted keyways which is more secure than the conventional Double Locking Padlocks. Still further object of this invention is to provide a Double Locking Padlock which provides a rotating driving cam snugly fitted inside the solid brass body of the padlock, holding the two locking bolts securely, so as to keep the shackle in its locked position.<br>
Still further object of this invention is to provide a Double Locking Padlock with restricted keyways which cannot be opened without  its original key.<br>
Still further object of this invention is to provide a Double Locking Padlock where the key cannot be removed from Padlock until the shackle is firmly  locked.<br>
Still further object of this invention is to provide a Double Locking - Padlock with changeable core.<br>
A Double Locking Padlock consisting of a body (1) open at one end having cylindrical holes (2) at the top on its extremity provided with enlarged grooves (3) for running   shackle (4) having inverted "J" shape configuration provided with<br><br><br>
inside groove (5) on both of its legs; which is held by means of a pin for arresting members (6) during its unlocking position by means of grooves and pin arrangement; a cartridge consisting of a cylinder (7) having at least one longitudinal projections which will allow only matching key to enter and prevent entry of any other key; surrounded with cylinder housing (8) and a outer casing member (9) which is introduced to the open end of body and held in position by a screw member (10) from outside; said cylinder having plurality of inside grooves which are spring loaded and are automatically located whereby the key member (11) having multiplicity of indentation (12) with mirror image 'on both side and edges thereby mating it reversibly operable with matching configuration to rotate the cylinder for locking &amp; unlocking position; a cam (13) is mounted in outer periphery of the cylinder in the inner side of the key hole which has a restricted play due to the stopper pin (14) provided on the cylinder housing; a driving cam member (15) with a projection at the bottom (16) is positioned inside through the key way to lock the two bolt member (17) positioned at its side through the curvature of the rectangular projection provided on its top surface (18) which pushes the bolts into the grooves provided inside the shackle for locking firmly and during unlocking position the bolts are free to retract while the shackle  is  pulled out.<br>
The invention will now be clear from the following description of figure 1 to 4 in the accompanying drawing.<br>
Figure 1: is a sectional view of a Double Locking Padlock.<br>
Figure 2 : is a isometric view of a Double Locking Padlock in its locking  position.<br>
Figure 3 : is a isometric view of a Double Locking Padlock in its   unlocking position.<br>
Figure 4: is a  exploded  view   of  a Double Locking Padlock.<br>
Figure 5 : is a Front view of a Double Locking Padlock in its unlocking position.<br><br><br>
Figure 6 : is a Front view of a Double Locking Padlock in its locking position.<br>
Figure 7: is a Side view of a Double Locking Padlock.<br>
Referring to Figures 1 - 7 in the accompanying drawings, Accordingly there is provided a Double Locking Padlock with consisting of a body (1) open at one end having cylindrical holes (2) at the top on its extremity provided with enlarged grooves (3) for running shackle (4) having inverted "J" shape configuration provided with inside groove (5) on both of its legs; which is held by means of a pin for arresting members (6) during its unlocking position by means of grooves and pin arrangement; a cartridge consisting of a cylinder (7) having at least, one longitudinal projections which will allow only matching key to enter and prevent entry of any other key; surrounded with cylinder housing (8) and a outer casing member (9) which is introduced to the open end of body and held in position by a screw member (10) from outside; said cylinder having plurality of inside grooves which are spring loaded and are automatically located whereby the key member (11) having multiplicity of indentation (12) with mirror image on both side and edges thereby mating if reversibly operable with matching configuration to rotate the cylinder for locking &amp; unlocking position; a cam (13) is mounted in outer periphery of the cylinder in the inner side of the key hole which has a restricted play due to the stopper pin (14) provided on the cylinder housing; a driving cam member (15) with a projection at the bottom (16) is positioned inside through the key way to lock the two bolt member (17) positioned at its side through the curvature of the rectangular projection provided on its top surface (18) which pushes the bolts into the grooves provided inside the shackle for locking firmly and during unlocking position the bolts are free to retract while the shackle  is   pulled out;<br>
A locking mechanism with added security. In particular, in this Padlock, having a solid brass body construction, the Shackle is secured in its locked position from both ends, which makes it difficult to pry-open by jimmying or similar device. In conventional Double Locking Padlocks there are two independent laterally sliding<br><br><br>
locking bolts, which engages in the slots provided on both ends of the shackle. If excessive force is applied on the shackle in locked condition of the padlock, a possibility exists for these bolts to slide backward and deflect a little so as to allow the shackle to come out, thus type of conventional double locking mechanism is insecure. Therefore their need to provide more secure double locking Padlocks. However in this invention is being referred to, a rotating driving cam which snugly fits inside the solid brass body of the padlocks hold the two locking bolts securely, so as to keep the shackle in its locked position.<br>
Since the two locking bolts are held by the driving cam at two diametrically opposite ends, the forces coming on these locking bolts, in the event of any attempt made to force open the shackle, would effectively be nullified, thus preventing any undue deflection or damage to the driving cam.<br>
These double locking brass padlock could be made in other sizes and by using "Ultra Locking System" of Godrej, which is being patented or any other equivalent locking systems. The Locking System can also be incorporated with Master Key System.<br>
Construction:<br>
The Lock Body, Driving Cam, Cam, Sleeve, Cylinder, Cylinder Housing, Pins etc, are made of Brass. The shackle could be made of either Brass or Steel depending on user requirement. The two Locking Bolts are made of steel for added strength. The keys can be made of either Nickel- Silver or Brass depending on type of key. The Keys can also be provided with plastic Key- Head if needed.<br>
Assembly<br>
The assembly of cylinder and cylinder housing is prepared separately based on its  specific key   combination (this lock can also  be provided with Master key<br><br><br>
system of Godrej as per specific customer needs). The cylinder Housing assembly is housed in a Sleeve. The cam are securely placed at the end of the cylinder assembly.<br>
the two locking bolts are inserted in their respective holes in the Lock body and then the Shackle is inserted and locked in position. The Driving cam is then placed properly inside the recess provided inside the lock body, so as to hold the locking bolts at two ends of the Driving cam. The cyHnder assembly is then inserted inside the lock body and it is held in its position by a cylinder housing locking screw which is fitted through a small hole on the side of the lock body. This hole is subsequently sealed by a brass cap which is press fitted and ground flush, so as to   hide the hole on  lock body.<br>
Function:<br>
The key is rotated counter-clockwise to impart a rotational movement to the driving cam so that the lug shaped projection on the driving cam pushes the two locking bolts so as to engage in the slots provided on the shackle, thus locking the padlock.<br>
The key is rotated in clockwise direction to unlock the padlock. The key can be pulled out from the lock cylinder only in the locked condition of the padlock. The key and the visible edge of cylinder assembly on the lock body can be numbered for easy identification (of master keying system).<br>
This is an embodiment of the invention. Several modifications are possible may be considered within the ambit and spirit of this invention. Since many modifications, variations and changes in detail may be made to the above described embodiments, it is intended that all matters described in the foregoing description as described in the accompanying specification.<br><br><br>
WE   CLAIM:<br>
1. A Double Locking Padlock consisting of a body (1) open at one end having cylindrical holes (2) at the top on its extremity provided with enlarged grooves (3) for running shackle (4) having inverted "J" shape configuration provided with inside groove (5) on both of its legs; which is held by means of a pin for arresting members (6) during its unlocking position by means of grooves and pin arrangement; a cartridge consisting of a cylinder (7) surrounded with cylinder housing (8) and a outer casing member (9) which is introduced to the open end of body and held in position by a screw member (10) from outside; said cylinder having plurality of inside grooves which are spring loaded and are automatically located whereby the key member (11) having multiplicity of indentation (12) with matching configuration to rotate the cylinder for locking &amp; unlocking position; a cam (13) is mounted in outer periphery of the cylinder in the inner side of the key hole which has a restricted play due to the stopper pin (14) provided on the cylinder housing; a driving cam member (15) with a projection at the bottom (16) is positioned inside through the key way to lock the two bolt member (17) positioned at its side through the curvature of the rectangular projection provided on its top surface (18) which pushes the bolts into the grooves provided inside the shackle for locking firmly and during unlocking position the bolts are free to retract while the shackle is pulled out.<br>
