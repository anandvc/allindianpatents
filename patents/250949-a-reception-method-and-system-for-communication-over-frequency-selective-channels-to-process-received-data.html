				<th>Abstract</th>
				<td>The invention relates to a receiving method for communications on a frequency selective channel having a large number of transmitting and receiving antennas which is characterised in that it makes it possible to process data which is successively modulated, spread and processed prior to the transmission thereof and is received by the receiving antennas. For this purpose, the inventive method consists in carrying out: a first linear filtering (202, 202&#x27;), a first interference subtraction (201) which uses a pre-regenerated inter-antenna (MAI) and intersymbol (ISI) interference estimate, a second linear filtering (205, 205&#x27;), a second interference subtraction (201) which uses a pre-regenerated interuser (MUI) interference estimate and a processing which is based on the received data and generates MAI+ISI and MUI interference estimates from the thus filtered data. A receiving system for carrying out said method and a transmission system comprising said receiving system are also disclosed.</td>

"DISJOINT ITERATIVE CHIP EQUALISATION AND MULTI-USER DETECTION FOR CDMA COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS ON A MIMO<br>
CHANNEL"<br>
FRANCE TELECOM French Limited Company of 6 Place d'Alleray F-75015, Paris, France<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br><br>
DISJOINT ITERATIVE CHIP EQUALISATION AND MULTI-USER DETECTION FOR CDMA COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS ON A MIMO<br>
CHANNEL<br>
5   GENERAL TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to the field of digital communications.  It concerns how to decode efficiently digital data transmitted on a frequency-selective MIMO channel at the same time as optimizing the<br>
10  performance1complexity trade-off.  Figure 1 shows an<br>
overall method of transmission on a frequency-selective MIMO channel 300 between a sender 100 with T send antennas, delivering signals x[n]   at the time n,   and a receiver 200 with R receive antennas, receiving signals<br>
15  y[n] at the time n.<br>
GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF THE PRIOR ART<br>
Any communications system managing the access of multiple users to the same channel by allocating specific<br>
20  spreading codes (CDMA) is limited in capacity by multiuser interference (MUI) between users.  In the context of the present invention, transmission is envisaged on a channel liable to generate other kinds of interference such as spatial multi-antenna interference (MAI) caused<br>
25  by multiple send antennas and intersymbol interference<br>
(ISI) caused by the frequency selectivity of the channel. On reception, these various kinds of interference are cumulative and make recovering the useful information difficult.<br>
30   Pioneering work carried out by S. Verdu in the 1980s clearly demonstrated the benefit of exploiting the structural properties of multi-user interference (MUI), multi-antenna interference (MAI) and intersymbol interference (ISI) to improve performance for a fixed<br>
35  load (the number of users per chip) or to improve the load for fixed performance.<br><br>
73<br>
Many types of linear detectors have been studied, capable of supporting a greater or lesser load, which load may be evaluated analytically under asymptotic conditions.  Without recourse to iterative techniques,<br>
5  	the performance of these detectors falls far short of the performance of a maximum likelihood (ML) detector (for a system with or without coding).<br>
The class of non-linear LIC-ID detectors based on linear iterative cancellation of the interference thus<br>
10  offers an excellent trade-off between performance and complexity.  LIC-ID detectors use the following functions: linear filtering, weig[n]Ted regeneration of interference (regardless of its nature), subtraction of the regenerated interference from the received signal.<br>
15  They deliver decisions on the sent modulated data (or<br>
symbols) with a reliability that increases in monotonous fashion with each new attempt.  LIC-ID detectors which are intended to eliminate ISI (at block level) asymptotically achieve the performance of an optimum ML<br>
20  detector with a computation complexity similar to that of a linear equalizer.  LIC-ID detectors intended to combat MUI approximate the performance of the optimum ML detector with a computation complexity comparable to that of a simple linear detector.<br>
25       A remarkable feature of LIC-ID detectors is that they can easily be combined with hard or weig[n]Ted decisions delivered by the channel decoder, thus effecting separate and iterative detection and decoding of the data.<br>
30       For CDMA systems that are overloaded (by hypothesis by MUI) transmitting on frequency-selective MIMO channels, the level of interference is such that using LIC-ID receivers proves essential.  If an iterative strategy is selected, the complexity of the receivers can<br>
35  be reduced, and rendered reasonable, only by simplifying the iterative processing as much as possible.  LIC-ID detectors are treated separately for ISI and for MUI in<br><br><br>
reference [1] (see below) and in the case of ISI+MUI in reference [2] (see below).<br>

5  	Block-Iterative Interference Cancellation Techniques for Digital Communication Receivers", IEEE J. VLSI Signal Processing (Special Issue on Signal Processing for Wireless Communication Systems), vol. 30, pp. 197-215, Jan.-Mar. 2002.<br>

15<br>
Their generalization to MUI+MAI+ISI still constitutes an open subject of research, in particular because of the complexity of the processing to be effected, implying computations on particularly large<br>
20  matrices.<br>
If a hypothesis of orthogonality exists between the various users on sending, one tempting approach is to re-establish orthogonality at the chip level before any<br>
25  attempt at multi-user detection.  Optimum multi-user<br>
detection then amounts to a bank of filters matched to each user.  This approach, developed in document [3] (see below) for a non-overloaded CDMA communications model transmitting on a frequency-selective SISO channel,<br>
30  proves to be the optimum when aperiodic spreading is considered, for example.<br>

The present invention goes beyond the framework of the above reference by considering an overloaded CDMA communications model transmitting on a frequency-selective MIMO channel.<br>

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
A first aspect of the invention proposes a receiving method according to any one of claims 1 to 21.<br>
A second aspect of the invention proposes a <br>
10  transmission system according to claim 22.<br>
A third aspect of the invention proposes a receiving method according to any one of claims 23 to 33.<br>
An object of the present invention is to propose a receiver for "multicode" CDMA transmission (K &gt; T) and1or <br>
15  overloaded CDMA transmission (K potential users or<br>
streams, spreading factor N 
20  and a perfect knowledge of the CSI at the receiver.  The<br>
receiver is based on a combination of simple mechanisms and techniques to obtain the best possible quality of service at fixed spectral efficiency and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) or the best possible usable bit rate at fixed<br>
25  quality of service, band and SNR.<br>
To this end, the invention proposes a device comprising:<br>
• Means for guaranteeing temporal decorrelation of samples of noise affecting the chips when the multiple<br>
30  access model with K potential users is reformed on<br>
reception assuming the absence of MAI+ISI, said means comprising chip interleaving before transmission over the MIMO channel or aperiodic spreading.  Note that although chip interleaving is not necessary for internal linear<br>
35  aperiodic coding, it remains an option.<br><br><br>
The invention proposes an equalization and iterative decoding device including a data detector receiving the data coming from the various send antennas comprising:<br>
•	first linear filtering processing for each send<br>
5  antenna the MAI+ISI interference and generating<br>
statistics on the chips sent using the spatial diversity offered by the R receive antennas;<br>
•	means for subtracting, before or after any linear<br>
filtering associated with each send antenna, from the<br>
10  received signal the MAI+ISI interference regenerated for that antenna from the available estimates of the sent modulated data (or symbolic data);<br>
•	means for reordering the equalized chips into a<br>
multiple access system with K potential users in which<br>
15  the additive noise affecting the various chips is assumed to be Gaussian white noise;<br>
•	second linear filtering processing the MUI<br>
interference on the basis of the chips previously<br>
equalized and reordered and generating statistics on the<br>
20  symbolic data sent by each of the K potential users;<br>
•	means for subtracting, before or after any linear<br>
filtering for each user, from the observed signal the MUI<br>
interference regenerated for that user from available<br>
estimates of the symbolic data sent;<br>
25       • means for processing these statistics and<br>
generating probabilistic bit information usable for external decoding;<br>
•	external decoding with weig[n]Ted inputs and<br>
outputs, capable of generating probabilistic information<br>
30  referred to as extrinsic information, pertinent for the calculation of the estimates of the sent symbolic data (in the sense of the criterion of minimizing the mean square error (MMSE));<br>
•	means for recursively concatenating the output of<br>
35  the external decoder both with the MAI+ISI interference<br>
regenerator, and with the MUI interference regenerator.<br><br><br>

DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS OF THE PRESENT<br>
INVENTION<br>
1. General structure of the sender<br>
Reception is intimately linked to the sending mode, <br>
5  which can be defined by a modulation1coding scheme of<br>
high spectral efficiency, and high adaptability capacity, based on the use of spread spectrum modulation and on the use of multiple send and receive antennas.  The proposed solution is pertinent assuming no knowledge of the send<br>
10  channel (no CSI) and a perfect knowledge of the receive channel (CSI).  The communications model is briefly described below in order to introduce a third embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Referring to Figure 2 and Figure 5, the useful<br>
15  digital data is collected and grouped into a message m of K0  bits constituting the send digital data source 101.  In each message m, a linear external code C0 having an N0 x K0  generator matrix G0 and constructed on F2 assigns at 102 a code word v of length N0  bits defined by the<br>
20  matrix equation:<br>
v = G0 m<br>
The external coding yield is:<br><br><br>
The length N0  of the code words is linked to the<br>
25  various parameters of the system by the equation:<br>
N0 = K X L X q<br>
in which K designates the total number of potential users, L the length of the packets (in symbol times) and q  the number of bits per modulation symbol.  The code may<br>
3	0  be of any type, for example a convolutional code, a<br>
turbocode, an LDPC code, etc.  In a multiple access type configuration, the message m consists in a plurality of multiplexed messages from different sources.  Coding is effected independently on each component message.  The <br>
35 	 code word v results from the concatenation 103 of the various code words produced.<br><br><br>
The code word v is sent to an interleaver 104 operating at the bit level and, where appropriate, having a particular structure.  In a multiple access type configuration, the interleaving acts piece by piece on<br>
 5  the various code words placed one after the other.  The output of this interleaver is broken up into KL  sets of g bits called integers.<br>
The stream of integers is demultiplexed 105 onto K separate channels, where K may be chosen arbitrarily to<br>
 10  be strictly greater than the number T of send antennas. The output from this operation is a K x L  integer matrix D.  The L columns d[n]   n = 0, ..., L-l of this matrix D have<br>
the following structure:<br>
d[n] = [d1[n]T d2[n]T    ... dK[n]T]T F2<br>
15  in which the component integers dk[n]   k  = 1, ..., K are<br>
themselves structured as follows:<br><br>
Referring to Figure 3, 4, 6, or 7, the <br>
integers dk [n]<br>
of the matrix D are then individually modulated 107 via a <br>
20	modulation table :F1 to yield modulated data, or more precisely complex symbols sk[n]   of a constellation     with Q = 2q elements.  This transforms the integer matrix D into a K x L  complex matrix S the L columns s[n]<br>
n =  0, ..., L-l whereof are structured as follows:<br>
25	s[n]D11(d[w]) = [*,[n] s2[n]  ...   sK[n]J e3K<br>
It is useful to specify the following inverse relationships:<br>
11-'(sH)DdH   frl(sk[n])Udk[n]   tf (sk[n])U dkJ[n]<br>
This is followed by internal linear coding (or spreading) 30   of the data.  There are several options as to the<br>
definition of the generator matrix W of the internal linear coding (more precisely: generator matrix of the internal linear coding on the body of the complexes) that may impact on the structure of the sender and on the<br>
35	characteristics of the linear front-ends on reception.<br><br><br>
Periodic spreading (or internal linear coding) where W is used again in each symbol time.  To guarantee temporal decorrelation of the samples of noise affecting the chips when the multiple access system is reformed <br>
5 after equalization, chip interleaving must be applied before transmission over the MIMO channel;<br>
• Aperiodic spreading (or internal linear coding) where Wn depends explicitly on the symbol time.  Aperiodic spreading guarantees temporal decorrelation of the <br>
10  samples of noise affecting the chips when the multiple access system is reformed after equalization.  Chip interleaving is no longer necessary but remains an option.<br>
Moreover, the spreading may be space-time (or <br>
15  space-frequency) spreading or only time (or frequency) spreading if it is effected independently for each antenna.<br>
1.1 Space-time (or space-frequency) spreading (or<br>
20  internal linear coding) under .overload conditions<br>
Referring to Figure 3 or Figure 4, it is assumed here that aperiodic space-time (or space-frequency) spreading is effected.<br>
The space-time (or space-frequency) spreading is<br>
25  effected for each matrix S by means of an N x K  internal<br>
coding matrix Wn, which is denoted W in the periodic<br>
context), where:<br>
N = TxSF    SFGD<br>
This generator matrix is also called a spreading <br>
30  matrix.  For example, this matrix may be considered to be constructed from N orthogonal spreading codes with spreading factor N.  This internal linear coding therefore corresponds, in this case, to space-time (space-frequency) spreading with spreading factor N.  The<br>
35  internal coding yield (or load) of the system is the<br>
ratio:<br><br><br><br>
The multiplication at  108  of  the  symbol vectors   s[n]<br>
by the generator matrix Wn produces  a vector:<br>
5	zHDW„s[n] = [z,[n]   z2[n]  ...   z,[n]]TeD"<br>
The  relationship may also be written at  the matrix level:<br><br>
10  1.1.1 Spreading followed by chip interleaving<br>
Chip interleaving is necessary if the spreading is periodic (W = Wn) in order to be able (afterwards) to implement reception in accordance with the invention. Referring to Figure 4, the chip vectors z[n]<br>
15   n = 0,...,Z-1 are multiplexed at 109 into a single stream of chips.  The chip stream then drives a chip interleaver 110, the output whereof is demultiplexed at 111 into T separate chip, streams (one for each send antenna).  The effect of this operation is to transform the NxL   chip<br>
20  matrix Z:<br>
Z = [z[0]   z[l]   •••   z[Z-l]]eDWxL<br>
into  a   TxLSF   chip matrix X:<br>
X = [x[0]   x[l]   -   x[LSF-1]]eUTxLS' the  columns   x[1]   1 = 0,---,ZS'F -1   whereof  constitute  the  inputs 25       of  the MIMO channel:<br>
x[1] = [*,[1]   x2[l]   -   xT[l]]J^T<br>
1.1.2 Spreading not followed by chip interleaving Referring to Figure 3, the chip vectors z[n]<br>
30 	n = 0,...,L-1  are demultiplexed into T separate chip streams (111, one for each send antenna).  The effect of this operation is to transform the NxL   chip matrix Z:<br>
Z = [z[0] z[l] - z[L-l]]eUN*L <br><br>
into a TXLSF   chip matrix X:<br><br>
IS 13<br>
X = [x[0]   x[l]   •••   x[LSF-1]]Є‮ TxLSF<br>
the columns x[1] I = 0,---,LSF-1   whereof constitute the inputs<br>
of the MIMO channel:<br>
x[1] = [x,[1]   x2[l]  ...   xT[l]TЄ‮T<br><br>
5<br>
1.2 Time (or frequency) spreading (internal linear<br>
coding)<br>
In this variant of the invention, shown in Figure 6<br>
or Figure 7, compatible with the HSDPA mode of the UMTS 10  standard, there are SF   orthogonal codes of length SF .<br>
The parameter N is always a multiple of T:<br>
N = TxSF    SFЄ‮<br>
The SF  available codes are re-used at each send antenna (this is the code re-use principle).  The 15  spreading, effected independently for each antenna, is<br>
periodic or aperiodic time (or frequency) spreading (W = Wn in the periodic context).<br>
This imposes that K be also a multiple of T:<br>
K=TxU   UeU<br>
20  This condition, which is not limiting on the invention, yields a new expression for the internal coding yield<br>
(load):<br><br><br>
The generator matrix Wn has a block diagonal structure:<br>
"w(1)      o<br>

Referring to Figure 5, the integer vector d[n] <br>
30 (demultiplexed at 105, after being coded at 102 and<br>
interleaved at 104) sent at the time n  has the following particular structure:<br><br>
V51h<br><br>
d[n] = [d(1)[n]T   d(2)[n]T   ...   d{T)[n]TЄ F2qk in which the  symbol vectors   d(l)[n]t = l,...,T   are  themselves defined as   follows:<br>
d(1)[n] = [d1(t)[n]T    d1(t)[n]T   …   d(T)[n]T]T ЄF2qk<br><br>
5       Referring to Figure 5, the modulation 107 of this multiplexed data d[n] yields a modulated data (or symbols) vector sent at the time n  having the following particular structure:<br>

      s(1)[n]= [s1(1)[n]s2(1)[n]TЄ‮U<br>
The multiplication 108 of the symbol vector s[n]   by<br>
the generator matrix Wn produces the vector:<br>
15	z[n]‮Wns[n]<br>
which also has a particular structure:<br>
z(1)[n]‮WnS[n]T   z(2)[n]T   ...   z(T)[n]T]TЄ‮N<br>
in which the chip vectors   z(1)[n]   t = 1,...,T   are  themselves<br>
defined as  follows:<br>
20	z(1)[n]‮Wn(t)s(t)[n]= [z1(t)[n]    z2(t)[n]  ...    z(t)sF [n]]TЄ‮<br>
1.2.1 Spreading followed by chip interleaving<br>
Chip interleaving is necessary if the spreading is periodic (W = Wn) in order to be able (afterwards) to 25  implement reception in accordance with the invention. Referring to Figure 7, the chip vectors z[n]<br>
n = 0,...,L-l   are multiplexed at 109 into a single stream of chips.  The chip stream then drives a chip interleaver 110, the output whereof is demultiplexed at 111 into T 30  separate chip streams (one for each send antenna).  The effect of this operation is to transform the NxL   chip matrix Z:<br>
Z = [z[0]   z[l]   •••   z[L-l]]Є‮NxL<br><br><br>
into a TxLSF   chip matrix X:<br>
X = [x[0] x[l] - x[LSF-1]]Є‮TxLSr<br>
the columns x[1] I = 0,---,LSF -1 whereof constitute the inputs<br>
of the MIMO channel:<br>
5	x[1] = [x1[1] x2[l] …..   xT[1]]TЄ‮T<br>
1.2.2 Spreading not followed by chip interleaving<br>
Referring to Figure 6, the chip vectors z(t) [n]   are<br>
then multiplexed at 109-t onto the send antenna t.<br>
10       It will be noted that, in this sending variant, the recovery of the spatial diversity is effected via the code G0 (at 102) and external bit interleaving (at 104). The overload capacity, which is known to increase with the length of the spreading codes, is lower.<br>
15       The sending method fits naturally into the general<br>
class of space-time codes.  The spectral efficiency of<br>
the system (in bits per use of the channel), assuming a<br>
limited band ideal Nyquist filter, is equal to:<br>
η = TXp0XqXa<br>
20       In practice, the send shaping filter has a non-null overflow factor (roll-off) e.  At the receiver, a filter matched to this send filter could be used for all the receive antennas.  It is assumed that the channel estimation and timing and carrier synchronization<br>
25  functions are implemented so that the coefficients of the impulse response of the channel are regularly spaced by an amount equal to the chip time (channel equivalent in the discrete baseband to the discrete time).  This hypothesis is legitimate, the Shannon sampling theorem<br>
30  imposing sampling at the rate {1 + Є)/ Tc  which may be<br>
approximated by 1/TC  when e is small.  Direct<br>
generalization is possible for expressions given below for a sampling rate equal to a multiple of 1/Tc .<br>
35  2. Channel model<br>
Transmission is effected on a frequency-selective<br><br><br>
B-block. channel with multiple inputs and multiple outputs (MIMO):<br>
H‮{H(1),H(2),...,H(B)}<br>
The channel H(b) is assumed constant over Lx  chips<br>
5  with the convention:<br>
LXSF=BXLx    BЄ‮<br>
The chip matrix X may be segmented into B separate TxLx   chip matrices X(1),...,X(S) (padded on the rig[n]T and<br>
left with physical zeros or guard times if necessary), 10  each matrix X(i) seeing the channel H(A) .<br>
The extreme cases of the B-block model are as follows:<br>
B = 1 and Lx = LSF =&gt; Ls = L  quasi - static model<br>
B = LSF and Lx = 1 =&gt; Ls = 1 ergodic (chip) model<br>
15       A renumbering of the chips is applied within each block.<br>
2.1 Convolutional channel model<br>
For any block index b,   the discrete time baseband<br>
2	0  equivalent channel model (chip timing) is used to write<br>
the receive vector y(A)[1]en" at the chip time 1 in the<br>
form:<br>
ywM=ZH
where P is the constraint length of the channel (in 25  chips), x(b)[l]Є‮T is the complex vector of T chips sent at<br>
the chip time 1, where HP(b)Є‮RXT is the matrix coefficient<br>
indexed p  of the impulse response of the block MIMO channel indexed b,   and v(6)[1]Є‮T is the complex additive<br>
noise vector.  The complex additive noise vectors v(A)[1]<br>
3	0  are assumed to be independent and identically distributed<br>
in accordance with an R-dimensional Gaussian law of circular symmetry with zero mean and covariance matrix G2I.  The P coefficients of the impulse response are RxT complex matrices, the inputs of which are <br>
35  identically distributed independent Gaussian inputs, with<br><br><br>
zero mean and with a covariance matrix satisfying the global power normalization constraint:<br><br>
p-1<br>
[P'O<br><br>
= 71<br><br>
in the case of a system with power equally distributed between the send antennas.  Given these hypotheses, the eigen values of the correlation matrices of the coefficients of the MIMO channel conform to a Wishart distribution.  It is emphasized that equal distribution of the power to the send antennas is a legitimate power allocation policy in the case of an absence of knowledge of the sending channel (no CSI).<br><br>
2.2 Block matrix channel model<br>
To introduce the data decoding algorithm, we must show a matrix system on the set of the type:<br>

2.3 Sliding window matrix channel model<br>
In practice, to reduce the dimensions, a .sliding<br>
window model is -used of length:<br>
Lw = Ll+L2+1‮ Ls<br>
The  following new system is  obtained: ywH = y(i)x(A)H+Y(6)[n]<br>

3. Multipath MIMO channel single-carrier transmission<br>
(HSDPA)<br>
It is assumed here that the bit rate is very high<br>
and that the coherence time of the channel is long, so that LxD SF .     For the HSDPA mode of the UMTS standard,<br>
the channel is quasi-static, i.e. B = 1.<br><br>
4. Multipath MIMO channel multicarrier transmission (MC-CDMA)<br>
25       The spreading (or internal linear coding) is<br>
space-frequency spreading or frequency spreading.  With reference to Figure 8, it is well known to the person skilled in the art that the introduction of a send IFFT 120 and a receive FFT 220 yields (ignoring interleaving)<br>
30	an equivalent channel that is not frequency selective (channel modeled by a circulating matrix using cyclic prefixes, then rendered diagonal in the Fourier base).<br><br><br>
Accordingly, each carrier sees a flat MIMO channel.<br>
Using the; formalism previously described, the channel<br>
after FFT may be seen as a non-selective B-block channel<br>
(P = 1).  The width of the sliding window for calculating 5  the filters is lw=1.<br>
5. General structure of the receiver 200<br>
The iterative receiver 200 is divided into successive interference cancellation stages.  A first<br>
10  stage cancels MAI+ISI interference at chip level and<br>
attempts to re-establish orthogonality within groups of users over all the antennas.  The second stage cancels MUI interference once orthogonality has been re-established within the groups of users.  The two<br>
15  stages are activated several times.  Given the scale of the problem, only linear approaches based on Wiener filters (MMSE criterion) or simple (single-user) matched filters are envisaged.  In both cases, a weighted version of the interference is removed before or after filtering.<br>
20<br>
5.1 Sent symbol MMSE estimation<br>
On any iteration i, there is assumed an a priori knowledge of the data expressed via logarithmic ratios on the bits of the sent symbols (also referred to as<br>
25  modulated data):<br><br><br>
By convention, these ratios have the value 0 on the first iteration.<br>
Referring to Figure 9 or Figure 10, on the basis of <br>
30  this a priori  information, there can be found at 212 the matrix S' of the estimates, in the sense of the MMSE criterion, of the symbols sk[n]   sent by the users k = 1,...,K<br>
at the times n = 0,...,L-l .     The estimate of a symbol is<br>
expressed as follows:<br>
35	3MQ5&gt;xPr'|&gt;*M=*]<br>
se3<br><br><br>
With deep space-time interleaving, the a priori probability, for a symbol may be approximated by the product of the marginal probabilities of the bits that constitute it:<br>
5<br>
equality being obtained for an infinite interleaving depth.<br>
To introduce the logarithmic ratio ^j[n] of the bit<br>
a priori  probabilities previously defined, we may write:<br><br>
10<br><br><br>
and finally find:<br><br><br>
5.2	Sent chip MMSE estimation <br>
15   From estimated symbolic data vectors s"'[n], there may<br>
be created at 214 (by applying to the estimates the spreading matrix Wn used on sending) the chip vectors estimated on each iteration i:<br>
?H = w„?'[n]=[z;H j'2[n] ... J;H]T<br>
20  that constitutes the estimated matrix Z' <br>
This is followed by processing 215 (which may comprise multiplexing, demultiplexing, chip interleaving, block division).<br>
The processing 215 conforms to that applied on <br>
25  sending downstream of spreading 108 (see any of Figures 3,4,6 and 7).<br>
For example, if the send processing comprises simple multiplexing to the T send antennas, as shown in Figures 3 and 6, the processing 215 comprises multiplexing onto T <br>
30  channels (shown in Figure 10).<br>
For example, if the send processing comprises multiplexing 109 onto one channel followed by chip interleaving 110 and demultiplexing (111) to the T send<br><br>
10<br><br>
antennas, as shown in Figures 4 and 7, the receive processing ,215 comprises multiplexing onto one channel, chip interleaving and demultiplexing onto T channels (shown in Figure 9) <br>
5.<br>
Following the processing 215, there are then generated (deduced from 11)   the matrices Xi(1),...,Xi(B) the<br>
columns whereof are the vectors:<br>
x,(A)[1]=[x;w[1] x'{b)[i] - Jc;(A)[1]]TeDr<br>
that are used for the linear iterative cancellation of the MAI+ISI interference at 201.<br><br><br><br>
15<br><br>
5.3 Re-establishing orthogonality between user groups by equalization to the chip time<br>
This section considers a given block of index b  that was sent by the antenna t, assuming identical processing for all of them.  The invention suggests replacing optimum detection of the chips x,[l]    (in the sense of the<br><br><br><br>
MAP enter<br><br>
ion) by an estimate in the sense of the<br><br><br><br><br>
25<br><br><br>
From ]the vector of the estimates of the chips on the iteration si:"<br><br>
the modifiled version is defined at 216, including a 0 at 5  position Ii^T+t , which is used to regenerate the MAI+ISI<br>
ij<br>
interference 216 for the symbol *,[/]:<br><br>
An estimate of MAI+ISI interference is therefore regenerated at 216 by multiplying this vector by said 10  Sylvester matrix H (its calculation is described above<br>
in section 2.2 or 2.3):<br><br>
The first (Wiener) filter 202 is applied to the observation vector obtained after subtraction at 201 of 15  the regenerated MAI+ISI interference:<br><br>
This first filter 202 minimizes the unconditional MSE on the (biased) estimate of the chip xt[l]   and may<br>
easily be derived from the orthogonal projection theorem:<br><br>
where e, ils the vector of dimension {L^+P-YyT   having a 1 at positioin LT + t   and zeroes everywhere else and where:<br>
S; □ E\(x[l]-% [t])(*[l]-t [']) Je □ (V+^Fx(v^-Dr S^dijigj^-ai2)!,...,^-^2)!,^^-^2)!,....^-^2)!}<br>

diagonal nnd &amp;T  evaluated using the following estimator:<br><br>
To satisfy the absence of bias constraint, the filter must be multiplied on the left by the correctior 30  factor:<br><br>
The 'Eollowing final expression for the filter is obtained:<br><br><br><br>
Alternatively, this filter may be replaced, completely] or from a different iteration i (i &gt; 1), by its single'l user matched filter (SUMF) version, given by:<br><br>
The evaluation of the chip xt[/] then corresponds, at the outputj °f the first filter 202, to:<br><br>
The variance of the residual MAI+ISI interference 10  plus noise is then equal to:<br><br>
and may in practice be evaluated using the following estimator:<br><br><br><br><br>
15	<br>
	Other possible equalization variant:<br>
j Figuie lib shows a variant of the first filtering<br>
202' and the regeneration of MAI+ISI interference 210',<br>
to be compared with the first filtering 202 and the i 20  regeneration of MAI+ISI interference 210 of Figure 11a<br>
(representing these two detection steps included in the<br>
|| Figure 9 or 10 scheme).<br>
II Referring to Figure lib, here the first filtering<br>
202' is eilfected upstream of the first subtraction 201 of<br>
25  the MAI+ISil interference regenerated at 210', and not<br>
downstream thereof as is the case in Figure 11a.<br>

5.4 Equivalent Gaussian multiple access and multi-user 5  detection[model<br>
The tjwo situations distinguished on sending (i.e. space-time (space-frequency) spreading, and time (or frequency) spreading) produce 1 or T different multiple access models.<br>
10<br>
5.4.1 Spac'je-time (or space-frequency) send spreading Referring to Figures 9 and 10, the chip matrices<br>
X'(1),...,X'(B) are here grouped into a single matrix X , which<br>
in turn is reorganized, after processing 203, into a 15  single NxL   matrix Z'; the processing 203 corresponds to<br>
the converse of the processing 215 described in section<br>
5.2.<br>
There! is then obtained a (canonic) Gaussian equivalent.! multiple access model of the type:<br><br>
20<br><br><br>
The observed chin matrix  is  denoted:<br>
~z[[0]    f|[l]    -    z[[L-l] Z'=[i'[0]   f[l]   -   V[L-l]]=   *'2\°]    *'2\l]    "'    *'2[L~l]  eDM<br>

The riiatrix of samples of noise in time is denoted:<br><br><br><br><br>
25   For each time n,   we set:<br><br>
The matrdJ! of covariance of the residual MAI+ISI interference plus noise vectors.  This is made diagonal either thonks to the chip de-interleaving included at 203 or the aperiodic nature of the spreading.  Its diagonal 5  elements o[re deduced from the variances previously estimates<br><br>
To simplify subsequent processing (MMSE multi-user detection , a variance of the noise samples that is 10   constant : or the whole of the system may be assumed:<br><br>
The Uemporal dependency is then eliminated: "■»[«]   v       «   v«-u,...,i, l<br>
5.4.1.1 Periodic space-time (space-frequency) send<br>
15  spreading<br>
As seen above, when the spreading is periodic, a chip inte;rleaver (110) is used on sending, so that the processing 203 includes chip de-interleaving (see Figure 9)<br>
20<br>
Variant l|i Overloaded regime: MMSE multi-user detection Here]! the optimum detection of the symbols sk[n]    (in<br>
the sense of the MAP criterion) is replaced by a non-biasei MMSE evaluation the complexity whereof is 25  polynomial in the parameters of the system and not<br>
exponential.  On each iteration i, for each potential user k,   tiaere is calculated at 204 a second filter g^eD"<br>
which, on the basis of an updated observation (relating to the column indexed n  of the preceding model), 30  eliminates the MUI interference corrupting the symbol sk[n]   and (produces an evaluation s'k[n]   of the sent<br>
modulated! data (or symbols) that minimizes the mean square erjror (MSE) :<br><br><br>
subject tdf the constraint of the absence of bias. An unconditional MSE would be preferable for reasons ofo complexity: the second filter g'^. is then invariant in<br>
time for the block concerned of the particular channel 5   (i.e. calculated once and for all over the whole of the block beiisg processed) .<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
From the vector of the estimates of the symbols at the iteration i:<br><br>
10  it is possible to define at 213 the modified version, including a 0 at position k,   that is used for the regeneration 213 of the MUI interference for the symbol<br><br><br>
An estimate of the MUI interference is therefore regenerated at 213 by multiplying the latter vector by the spreading matrix W used on sending:<br><br>
The second (Wiener, biased) filter is then applied 20  at 205 to the observation vector obtained following<br>
subtraction 204 of this regenerated MUI interference:<br><br>
This second filter 205 minimizes the unconditional MSE on this estimate of the symbol sk[n]   and can easily be<br>
25  derived using the theorem of orthogonal projection:<br>

To satisfy the constraint of absence of bias, the<br>
second filter must be multiplied on the left by the "<br>
correction factor:<br><br>
5       The final expression for the second filter is then obtained:<br><br><br><br>
The Evaluation or the symbol sk[n\   corresponds at the output of the second filter 205 to:<br><br>
The ariance of the residual MUI interference plus noise term %'k[n]   can be evaluated via the following<br>
estimator<br><br><br><br>
15<br>
Variant 21 Overloaded regime: SUMF (Single User Matched-<br>
Filter) detection<br>
In a simplified version, the second MMSE filter at 205 may be replaced from any iteration i by a second SUMF 20   filter:<br><br>
The following evaluation is obtained:<br><br>
This  approach avoids calculating N x N inverse 25  matrices.<br>
Variant 3); Non-overloaded regime<br>
In the  non-overloaded situation, we have:<br><br>
30       Detection amounts to applying the second filter gik=ekW  at 205 to the observation vector.<br>
The '^valuation is then obtained directly from:<br><br><br>
5.4.1.2 Aperiodic space-time (space-frequency) spreading<br>
In this case, the processing 203 may or may not include chip de-interleaving as described with reference to Figures] 9 and 10.  The (canonic) Gaussian equivalent <br>
5  multiple access model is now written:<br><br>
Only jiSUMF type detection is of reasonable complexity in the apejriodic context, and is therefore preferably used. <br>
10<br>
Variant 1:][ Overloaded regime<br>
The flilter then has the following expression:<br><br><br><br>
15  Variant 2:[ Non-overloaded regime<br>
The f (liter then has the following expression:<br><br><br><br>
5.4.2 Time! (or frequency) send spreading <br>
20       The chip matrices X'(1),…,X'(B) are grouped into a<br>
unique matrix X.  Following the processing 203, and with reference to Figures 9 and 10, X is reorganized into T SF    X L   matrices Z'(1),...,Z'(r) corresponding to T independent<br><br>
The observed chip matrix is denoted:<br><br>
(canonic) Gaussian equivalent multiple access models of 25  the type:<br>
The Matrix of the samples of noise decorrelated in <br>
30  time:<br><br><br><br>
the matrix' of covariance of the residual MAI+ISI<br>
5  interference plus noise vectors.  This is made diagonal i either by|the chip de-interleaving included in the<br>
processing 203 or by the aperiodic character of the<br>
spreading.  Its diagonal elements are deduced by the<br>
variances previously estimated over the various blocks<br>
10  processed<br><br>
To simplify subsequent processing (MMSE multi-user detection), a constant variance of the noise samples for the whole of the system may be assumed:<br><br><br><br>
The tjjemporal dependency is then eliminated:<br>
The calculations of the filters g„  for each<br><br><br>
 multiple access model being similar to those described<br>
 20  above, they will not be explained here.<br>
5.4.2.1 Periodic time (or frequency) send spreading As pireviously explained, when the spreading is periodic, jja chip interleaver (110) is used on sending, 25  and so the; processing 203 includes chip de-interleaving as described with reference to Figure 9.<br>
Variant 1 :j Overloaded regime: MMSE multi-user detection The filter,then has the following expression:<br><br>
5  Variant 2:1 Overloaded regime: SUMF (Single User Matched-Filter) detection<br>
From any iteration i, the MMSE filter may be replaced ty its sub-optimum SUMF version:<br><br>
10<br>
Variant 3: Non-overloaded regime i The filter then has the following expression:<br><br>
15  5.4.2.2 Periodic aperiodic time (or frequency) send spreading<br>
In this case, the processing 203 may or may not include chip de-interleaving as described with reference to Figures; 9 and 10.  The T (canonic) Gaussian equivalent<br>
20  multiple access models are now written:<br><br>
Only SUMF-type detection is of reasonable complexity in the aperiodic context.<br>
25  Variant 1:1 Overloaded regime ii The kilter then has the following expression:<br><br>
Variant 2\\   Non-overloaded regime 30       The filter then has the following expression:<br>

Other possible equalization variant:<br>
Regardless of the variants explained in sections 35  5.4.1 andjl 5.4.2, there is also a variant as to how to<br><br>
effect the1 second filtering 205' and the MUI interference<br>
regeneration 213' (described with reference to	-M.<br>
Figure 12b), to be compared to the second filtering	205<br>
j<br>
and the MU|I interference regeneration 213 of Figure	12a<br>
5   (repres en tiling these two detection steps included in	the<br>
Figure 9 djr 10 scheme) .<br>
Referring to Figure 12b, the second filtering 205' is here effected upstream of the second subtraction 204 of interference regenerated at 213', rather than <br>
10  downstrean thereof as in Figure 12a.<br>
The second filter g' used and the MUI interference reconstruction matrix b2' used may be deduced trivially from the second filter g  and the MUI interference<br>
!<br>
reconstruction matrix b2  previously computed (see above j 15  description with reference to Figures 9 or <br>
10 and 12a),<br>

5.5 Exchajige of probabilistic information with the channel decoder<br>
On tie basis of the output of the linear filtering 25  205 with T filters, g logarithmic a posteriori<br>
probability (APP) ratios are computed at 206 for each symbol, ay.  each time n = 0,...,L-l,   for each user k = \,...,K .<br>
These probabilistic quantities are defined as follows:<br><br>
30  and are referenced A in Figures 9, 10 and 13; or:<br><br><br>
into which we introduce:<br><br>
Expanding the numerator and the denominator gives:<br><br><br><br>
5       The ]fikelihoods are expressed as follows:<br>
On each  iteration i, a priori  information on the<br>
bits of the various symbols coming from the channel decoders J!09 is available and usable in the form of<br><br>
10  logarithmic APP ratios introduced beforehand and the<br>
expression for which is:<br><br>
Assuming space-time interleaving of sufficiently great depth, we may write:<br><br><br>
The extrinsic information on each bit delivered by weighted output demodulators 206 intended for the channel decoder 2D9 is then found at 207 from the equation:<br><br>
20       All the bit extrinsic information logarithmic ratios for all tie blocks are then collected and properly multiplexed and de-interleaved at 205, to be sent to the<br>
channel decoder 209.<br>
This decoder sees a unique vector  q e LI °   made up of 2 25   N0   bit intrinsic probability logarithmic ratios (one for<br>
each bit of the code word v).  Decoding 206 then uses an algorithm such as the flexible output Viterbi algorithm to deliver the logarithm X of a ratio of information APP to sent nodulated data (or symbols) bits.<br><br>
This [Logarithm X is then the basis on which are<br>
computed at 210a and 210b the bit extrinsic information logarithmic ratios, formally defined V7 = l,...,iV0 as follows:<br><br>
5       The code word extrinsic information logarithmic ratios {£/  calculated in the iteration i are similar,<br>
after bit interleaving and demultiplexing 208a and 208b, to the symbol bit APP logarithmic ratios {["l] on  next iteration.<br>
10       Reception in accordance with the invention refers<br>
not only to a method for implementing it but also to the system for executing it and any transmission system incorporating that reception system.<br><br>
