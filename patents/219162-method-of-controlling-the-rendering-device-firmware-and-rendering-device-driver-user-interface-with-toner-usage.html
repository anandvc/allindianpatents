FIELD OF THE TECHNOLOGY<br>
This Invention In general relates to printers and printing technologies. This invention further relates to the level and usage of toner in printer cartridges. More particularly, this invention relates to a method of controlling the printer firmware and printer driver Ul with printer toner usage.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART<br>
In the present scenario, after each printing job, the toner usage increases as a result of which the toner/ink in the printer cartridge decreases. There are number of ways in which user can be informed / intimated about the status of toner or ink in a rendering device (printer or MFP) such as:<br>
1.	Through status monitor/toolbox applications which continuously monitor and shows the toner usage to the user.<br>
2.	Showing the "toner toiv" message on the LCD panel of the rendering device.<br>
If the rendering device does not have an LCD panel then the status message will be through desktop application (status monitor/toolbox) whereby the user can be made aware of the status of toner usage.<br>
Figure 2 illustrates the stmcture of the present art wherein after each document printing, toner usage count gets incremented. If the count value is slightly less than the pre-specified threshold value, the toner low status of the rendering device will be communicated to the user by any one of the above methods.<br>
In the existing technology, the following limitations exist:<br>
1.	There is no way for the user to limit the toner/ink usage and conserve the toner/ink automatically when toner/ink is low. The user has to select some printer driver options before sending the print data.<br>
2.	When tonerAink is low, then rendering device does not shift to toner save<br><br>
mode automatically.<br>
3.	When toner/ink Is low and the user prints a high resolution and/or colorful image, then toner/Ink is exhausted quickly.<br>
4.	Printer driver at host side does not automatically switches to toner save mode when toner/ink in the rendering device is low.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The primary object of this invention is to invent a method of controlling the printer firmware and printer driver user interface with printer toner usage which is unique.<br>
It is another object of this invention to invent a method to save toner/ink usage of any rendering device such as a printer, when the level of these consumable items in the rendering device is close to pre-specified threshold value.<br>
It is further an object of this invention to provide a method wherein without manually selecting and setting the toner/ink save option, the user will be able to save these consumable items.<br>
The present invention proposes a method wherein when the toner/ink usage crosses a pre-specified threshold value, the rendering device switches the print mode to toner/ink save mode and prints the data in low resolution. When threshold value is slightly less than the toner level, rendering device shows low toner status. Threshold value can be decided by the manufacturer or optionally it can be user selectable, when the rendering device automatically switches to toner/ink save mode as toner level crosses the threshold value.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention relates to a method of controlling the printer firmware and printer driver user interface with printer toner usage comprising the steps of:<br><br>
a.	specifying  a  threshold  value  for toner save  mode  either  by  a<br>
manufacturer or by a user;<br>
b.	checking the toner level value;<br>
c.	comparing the toner level with the threshold value;<br>
d.	informing the user about the toner low status when the threshold value is<br>
slightly lower than the toner level value;<br>
e.	switching from a print mode of the rendering device to a toner/ink save<br>
mode when threshold value is greater than the toner level value; and<br>
f.	printing the data in low resolution on a print command,<br>
where the user is informed about the toner low value each time a print job is given when the toner level is less than the threshold value.<br>
The other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will be apparent from the accompanying drawings and the ensuing detailed description.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
Figure 1 illustrates the status of toner usage in the current art.<br>
Figure 2 shows the flowchart for toner usage in the present art.<br>
Figure 3 illustrates the present invention which sets the printer driver and rendering<br>
device to toner save mode.<br>
Figure 4 shows the proposed method where the printer and printer driver setting is<br>
changed when toner is low.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The preferred embodiments of the present invention will now be explained with reference to the accompanying drawings. It should be understood however that the disclosed embodiments are merely exemplary of the invention, which may be<br><br>
embodied in various forms. The following description and drawings are not to be construed as limiting the invention and numerous specific details are described to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention, as the basis for the claims and as a basis for teaching one skilled in the art how to make and/or use the invention. However in certain instances, well-known or conventional details are not described in order not to unnecessarily obscure the present invention in detail.<br>
Toner save mode and low resolution printing increases the life of toner/ink consumable items used by the rendering device for printing. So when toner/ink is low then rendering device (Printer/MFP) is switched over to the toner save and low resolution mode. Switching of the rendering device to toner save and low resolution mode can be decided on the basis of toner consumption rate algorithm. This consumption rate algorithm depends on the Printer/MFP device manufacturer. For e.g. consumption rate can be depending on the number of pages printed. After some specified number of printed pages, the device will go to toner save mode. Like this, consumption rate algorithm can be dependant of several factors such as number of pages, resolution, printing mode, &amp; contrast etc. When the user sends data to rendering device, driver user interface queries the toner status. If the toner is low then it switches the driver setting to toner save and low resolution printing mode. Therefore, by this process, the user will be able to save the toner/ink due to minimal usage<br>
According to figure 2. after each print job, the toner usage increases as a result of which the toner/ink in the printer cartridge decreases. After each document printing, toner usage count gets incremented. If the count value reaches a specified threshold value, the rendering device will show toner low status.<br>
Refening to figure 3 which shows the present implementation which sets the printer driver and rendering device to toner save mode. When toner/ink is low and reaches a pre-specified threshold value then the rendering device is switched to toner save and low resolution printing mode and low toner status is displayed. This is done on the basis of toner consumption rate algorithm. When user sends an image or data<br><br>
to rendering device for printing, the driver user interface queries the toner status and If the toner is low the rendering device is switched to toner save and low resolution printing mode.<br>
Referring to figure A, after each printing job, the toner usage increases as a result of which the quantum of toner/ink in the printer cartridge decreases. When toner/ink usage crosses a pre-specified threshold value, the rendering device switches the print mode to toner/ink save mode and prints the data in low resolution. When the threshold value is slightly less than the toner level value the rendering device shows low toner status. This is done as a precaution to inform the user that as to the quantum of toner/ink level is coming close to the threshold value. When the toner level usage crosses the threshold value, the printer firmware is made to show toner low status and change printer setting to toner save and low resolution printing mode. At the same time, the printer driver at host sends toner save and low resolution printing command.<br>
OPERATION OF THE INVENTION<br>
During each document printing, the rendering device updates the status of toner/ink usage while toner level decreases. When the toner level is slightly lower than the threshold value, the device displays a 'toner low' message. This alert is displayed in order that the user only sends print jobs to the rendering device that necessitates to use less amount of toner until the replacement/refilling of the toner/ink cartridge. When the threshold value is greater than the toner level, rendering device will automatically switch to a state where it requires less toner/ink for rendering by methods such as low resolution printing also displaying 'toner low message'. This can be achieved by setting the device to automatically shift to toner save and low resolution printing mode. On host side, the rendering device driver will check the status of toner. If it is low, then it will automatically select the toner save option and consequently print only using low resolution (lesser dpi) options.<br>
