				<td>OIL CIRCUIT FOR TWIN CAM<br>
INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINE<br>
CROSS -REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
[0001] This application is a continuation-in-part<br>
of U.S. Patent Application No. 10/188,131, filed on July<br>
1, 2002, and also of U.S. Patent Application No.<br>
10/198,787, filed on July 18, 2002.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002] The present invention relates to internal<br>
combustion engines, particularly single cylinder internal<br>
combustion engines such as those used to power<br>
lawnmowers, sump pumps, portable generators and other<br>
devices. More specifically, the present invention<br>
relates to a twin cam design and related oil circuit for<br>
implementation in such engines.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0003] Single cylinder internal combustion engines<br>
typically employ an intake valve and an exhaust valve for-<br>
al lowing fuel and air to enter the engine cylinder and<br>
allowing exhaust to exit the cylinder, respectively.<br>
These valves often are actuated by way of valve trains<br>
that impart Linear movement to the valves in response to<br>
rotational movement of cams. In many such engines, the<br>
intake and exhaust valves are actuated in one direction<br>
(to close) by respective springs and actuated in the<br>
opposite direction (to open) by respective rocker arms.<br>
The rocker arms in turn are actuated by respective push<br>
cods that ride along respective cams that, are supported<br>
by and rotates about a camshaft, which in turn is driven<br>
by a crankshaft of the engine. A fan also driven by the<br>
crankshaft blows air across the cylinder to cool the<br>
cylinder.<br>
[0004] In such enqines, it is important that oil or<br>
other lubrication be provided to at least the main<br>
bearings for the crankshaft and the camshaft, and that<br>
such oil be filtered. Consequently, most single cylinder<br>
enqines also have carefully-designed lubrication systems<br>
to provide the necessary lubrication. The lubrication<br>
systems typicality include an oil reservoir, a pump, and<br>
an oil circuit consisting of a series of passages by<br>
which oil is directed from the pump to the oil filter and<br>
to the components requiring lubrication. The oil<br>
passages are commonly manufactured by drilling or casting<br>
tubes into the crankcase and cover/oil pan of the engine.<br>
[0005] Single cylinder engines of this design have<br>
severai limitations. To begin with, the push rods that<br>
are positioned on such enqines in between the camshaft<br>
and the rocker arms are positioned close together on a<br>
single side of the cylinder. Likewise, the pair of<br>
rocker arms at the cylinder head are positioned close<br>
together along a single side of the cylinder head, as are<br>
the pair of valves. Consequently, the valve bridge, area<br>
of the cylinder head in between the valves, which is the<br>
hottest area of the cylinder head, is narrow and<br>
partially shielded from air being blown across the<br>
cylinder head by the fan. As a result, the valve bridge<br>
area may not be cooled as well as might be desirable,<br>
which can eventually cause weakening or breakage of the<br>
cylinder head, or to distortion/movement of the valve<br>
seats adjacent: to this valve bridge area.<br>
[0006] Additionally, the oil circuits in such<br>
single cylinder engines are often complicated in design<br><br>
and expensive to manufacture. In particular, the<br>
drilling or casting that is required in order to provide<br>
the required oil passages within the crankcase walls and<br>
cover/oil pan can be expensive and difficult to<br>
manufacture. The casting of tubular passages in<br>
particular is expensive insofar as it requires the use of<br>
cores or easting metal tubes within the engine material<br>
(e.g., aluminum). These drilling or casting (involving<br>
cores or metal tubes) procedures add to the complexity<br>
and costs of manufacturing the engine.<br>
[0007] Further, given their complexity and large<br>
number of moving parts, the valve trains (including the<br>
camshaft and crankshaft) of such engines also can be<br>
difficult and costly to design and manufacture. For<br>
example, the two cams on a camshaft of such an engine<br>
typically must be oriented differently so that their<br>
respective main cam lobes are 100 or more degrees apart.<br>
Consequently, the manufacture of a camshaft with two such<br>
differently-oriented cams can be difficult and expensive,<br>
particularly when it is desired to integrally form the<br>
camshaft and cams as a single part. The costs of<br>
manufacturing of such valve train components can be<br>
further exacerbated if it is desired to manufacture such<br>
components from materials that are more durable or that<br>
provide quieter operation, since it is typically more<br>
difficult to mold or machine complex parts from such<br>
materials.<br>
[0008] It would therefore be advantageous if a new<br>
single cylinder engine was designed that avoided or<br>
suffered less from the above problems. In particular, it<br>
would be advantageous if a single cylinder engine with<br>
robust, quietly-operating components could be designed<br>
that was more easily and cost-effectively manufactured<br>
than conventional engines, particularly in terms of the<br>
costs associated with the components of its valve train<br>
and lubrication system. Further, it would be<br><br>
advantageous if a single cylinder engine could be<br>
designed i.n which there was more effective cooling of the<br>
valve bridge area than in conventional engines.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0009] The present inventors have discovered a new,<br>
twin-cam single cylinder engine design having two<br>
camshafts that are each driven by the crankshaft.<br>
Because two camshafts are employed, one of which drives a<br>
valve train for an intake valve and one of which drives a<br>
valve train for an exhaust valve, the valves are<br>
respectively positioned on opposite sides of the cylinder<br>
so that the valve bridge area is exposed to allow for<br>
more effective cooling of that area. Each of the twin<br>
camshafts includes a respective internal passage<br>
extending the length of the respective camshaft. One of<br>
the camshafts is supported by an oil pump. Rotation of<br>
that camshaft drives the pump, causing oil to be pumped<br>
up through the internal passage-in that camshaft and also<br>
(in some embodiments) toward a lower bearing of the<br>
crankshaft.<br>
[0010] The oil pumped up through the internal<br>
passage in the camshaft is then directed through molded<br>
passages within a top of the crankcase, first to an oil<br>
filter, and then from the oil filter to an upper bearing<br>
of the crankshaft as well as to the other camshaft. Oil<br>
provided to the crankshaft, either by way of the upper<br>
bearing and the lower bearing or simply by way of the<br>
upper bearing, is further communicated through passages<br>
within the crankshaft to the crankpin bearing as well as<br>
to eccentric bearings that support a balance weight. The<br>
oil flowing through the internal passage within the top<br>
of the crankcase to the other camshaft further flows<br><br>
through that camshaft to the lower bearing of that<br>
camshaft.<br>
[0011] The passages within the top of the crankcase<br>
are formed by molding grooves in the top and covering<br>
those grooves with an additional plate. Because twin<br>
camshafts are employed, each of which has only a single<br>
cam lobe, the camshafts can more easily be manufactured<br>
from robust, quietly-operating materials. Additionally,<br>
by employing the passages within the top of the crankcase<br>
and within the camshafts, manufacture of the oil circuit<br>
is simpler and more cost-effective than in conventional<br>
engine designs. In particular, the number and complexity<br>
of drilled passages within the crankcase are reduced in<br>
comparison with comparable conventional engines. Thus,<br>
an engine can be constructed with comparatively less<br>
effort and expense that provides pressurized oil to a<br>
variety of components within the engine including, for<br>
example, crankpin and eccentric bearings along a<br>
crankshaft of the engine.<br>
[0012] In particular, the present invention relates<br>
to an internal combustion engine that includes a<br>
crankcase, a pump supported by the crankcase, where the<br>
pump has an inlet and a first outlet, and a first<br>
camshaft having a first channel extending between first<br>
and second ends of the first camshaft, where the first<br>
camshaft end is-supported at least indirectly by one of<br>
the pump and the crankcase, and where lubricant is<br>
provided from the pump to the first channel at the first<br>
end and communicated by way of the first channel to the<br>
second end. The internal combustion engine further<br>
includes a crankshaft supported by the crankcase, a<br>
second channel communicating at least a first portion of<br>
the lubricant delivered to the second end of the first<br>
camshaft by way of the first channel to a first<br>
crankshaft bearing of the crankshaft, and a third - channel<br>
within the crankshaft that receives at least a second<br><br>
portion of the lubricant: communicated by the second<br>
channel and further communicates at least a third portion<br>
of the second portion of the lubricant to a crankpin<br>
bearing on the crankshaft.<br>
[0013] The present invention additionally relates to<br>
a system that includes a pump capable of supplying<br>
lubricant, a first passage at least partially linking the<br>
pump to a crankshaft bearing so that at least a first<br>
portion of the lubricant supplied by the pump is<br>
communicated to the crankshaft bearing, and a crankshaft<br>
supported with respect to the crankshaft bearing. The<br>
crankshaft further includes a first eccentric bearing,<br>
where the first eccentric bearing is configured to<br>
support at least one balance weight component, and a<br>
second passage within the crankshaft, where the second<br>
passage is provided with at least a second portion of the<br>
lubricant by way of the crankshaft bearing and<br>
communicates at least a third portion of the lubricant to<br>
a first outer surface of the first eccentric bearing.<br>
[0014] The present invention additionally relates to<br>
a single-cylinder internal combustion engine that<br>
includes a cylinder, a crankcase, a first camshaft<br>
supported at least indirectly by the crankcase, and a<br>
second camshaft supported at least indirectly by the<br>
crankcase, where the first camshaft includes a first cam<br>
and the second camshaft includes a second cam. The<br>
engine also includes a crankshaft supported at least<br>
indirectly by the crankcase, where the crankshaft is at<br>
least indirectly coupled to each of the first and second<br>
camshafts so that rotation of the crankshaft causes<br>
rotation of each of the first and second camshafts and<br>
their respective cams, and where rotation of the<br>
respective cams is capable of producing corresponding<br>
movement of first and second valves associated with the<br>
cylinder, respectively. The engine additionally includes<br>
means for communicating lubricant to at least one bearing<br>
associated with the crankshaft.<br>
[0015] The present invention further relates to a<br>
method of communicating lubricant within an internal<br>
combustion engine. The method includes communicating at<br>
least a first portion of the lubricant to a crankshaft<br>
bearing by way of at least one first channel, and further<br>
communicating at least a second portion of the lubricant<br>
from the crankshaft bearing through at least one second<br>
channel within the crankshaft to an eccentric bearing,-<br>
where the eccentric bearing is configured for supporting<br>
at least a portion of a balance weight.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
[0036] Referring to Figs. 1 and 2, a new single<br>
cylinder, 4-stroke, internal combustion engine 100<br>
designed by Kohler Co. of Kohler, Wisconsin includes a<br>
crankcase 110 and a blower housing 120, inside of which<br>
are a fan 130 and a flywheel 140. The engine 100 further<br>
includes a starter 150, a cylinder 160, a cylinder head.<br>
170, and a rocker arm cover 180. attached to the<br>
cylinder head 170 are an air exhaust port 190 shown in<br>
Fig. 1 and an air intake port 200 shown in Fig. 2. As is<br>
well known in the art, during operation of the engine<br>
100, a piston 210 (see Fig. 7) moves back and forth<br>
within the cylinder 160 towards and away from the<br>
cylinder head 170. The movement of the piston 210 in<br>
turn causes rotation of a crankshaft 220 (see Figs. 7 and<br>
18), as well as rotation of the fan 130 and the flywheel<br>
140, which are coupled to the crankshaft. The rotation<br>
of the fan 130 cools the engine, and the rotation of the<br>
flywheel 14 0, causes a relatively constant rotational<br>
momentum to be maintained.<br>
[0037] Referring specifically to Fig. 2, the engine<br>
100 further includes an air filter 230 coupled to the air-<br>
intake port 200, which filters the air required by the<br>
engine prior to the providing of the air to the cylinder<br>
head. 170. The air provided to the air intake port 200 is<br>
communicated into the cylinder 160 by way of the cylindex-<br>
head 17 0, and exits the engine by flowing from the<br>
cylinder through the cylinder head and then out of the<br>
air exhaust port 190. The inflow and outflow of air into<br>
and out of the cylinder 160 by way of the cylinder head<br>
170 is governed by an input valve 240 and an output valve<br>
250, respectively (see Fig. 8). Also as shown in Fig. 2,<br>
the engine 100 includes an oil filter 260 through which<br>
the oil of the engine 100 is passed and filtered.<br>
Specifically, the oil filter 260 is coupled to the<br>
crankcase 110 by way of incoming and outgoing lines 270,<br>
280, respectively, whereby pressurized oil is provided<br>
into the oil filter and then is returned from the oil<br>
filter to the crankcase.<br>
[0038] Referring to Figs. 3 and 4, the engine 100<br>
is shown with the blower housing 120 removed to expose a<br>
top 290 of the crankcase 110. With respect to Fig. 3, in<br>
which both the fan 130 and the flywheel 140 are also<br>
removed, a coil 300 is shown that generates an electric<br>
current based upon rotation of the fan 130 and/or the<br>
flywheel 140, which together operate as a magneto.<br>
Additionally, the top 2 90 of the crankcase 110 is shown<br>
to have a pair of lobes 310 that cover a pair of spur-<br>
toothed gears 320, 325 (see Figs. 5 and 7-8). With<br>
respect to Fig. 4, the fan 130 and the flywheel 140 are<br>
shown above the top 290 of the crankcase 110.<br>
Additionally, Fig. 4 shows the engine 100 without the<br>
rocker arm cover 180, to more clearly reveal a pair of<br>
tubes 330, 335 through which extend a pair of respective<br>
push rods 34 0,345. The push rods 340,345 extend between<br>
a pair of respective rocker arms 350,355 and a pair of<br>
cams 360, 365 (see Fig. 8) within the crankcase 110, as<br>
discussed further below.<br>
[0039] Turning to Figs. 5 and 6, the engine 100 is<br>
shown with the top 290 of the crankcase 110 removed from<br>
a bottom 37 0 of the crankcase 110 to reveal an interior<br>
380 of the crankcase. Additionally in Figs. 5 and 6, the<br>
engine 100 is shown in cut-away to exclude portions of<br>
the engine that extend beyond the cylinder 160 such as<br>
the cylinder head 170. With respect to Fig. 6, the top<br>
290 of the crankcase 110 is shown above the bottom 370 of<br>
the crankcase in an exploded view. In this embodiment,<br>
the bottom 370 includes not only a floor 390 of the<br>
crankcase, but also all four side walls 400 of the<br>
crankcase, while the top 290 only acts as the roof of the<br>
crankcase. The top 290 and bottom 370 are manufactured<br>
as two separate pieces such that, in order to open the<br>
crankcase 110, one physically removes the top from the<br>
bottom. Also, as shown in Fig. 5, the pair of gears 320,<br>
325 within the crankcase 110 form part of respective<br>
camshafts 410,415 (see also Fig. 8) which in turn are<br>
supported by the bottom 370 of the crankcase 110. As<br>
discussed further with respect to Figs. 9-12, the<br>
camshaft 410 in particular is supported by a pump 412,<br>
which in turn is supported by the bottom 370 of the<br>
crankcase 110. Because of its location along the bottom<br>
370 of the crankcase 110, which acts as an oil reservoir,<br>
the pump 412 receives oil- collected within the bottom 370<br>
of the crankcase 110. The pump 412 further is actuated<br>
due to the rotation of the camshaft 410. A lower<br>
crankshaft bearing 540 for supporting the crankshaft 220<br>
is additionally shown in Fig. 5 along the floor 390.<br>
[0040] Referring to Fig. 7, a top view of the<br>
engine 100 is provided in which additional internal<br>
components of the engine are shown. In particular, Fig.<br>
7 shows the piston 210 within the cylinder 160 to be<br>
coupled to the crankshaft 22 0 by a connecting rod 420.<br>
The crankshaft. 220 is in turn coupled to a rotating<br>
counterweight 4 30 and counterbalances 4 40, which balance<br>
some of the forces exerted upon the crankshaft 220 by the<br>
piston 210. A gear on the crankshaft 220 further is in<br>
contact with each of the gears 320,325, and thus the<br>
crankshaft communicates rotational motion to the<br>
camshafts 410,415. Fig. 7' further shows a spark plug 450<br>
located on the cylinder head 170, which provides sparks<br>
during power strokes of the engine to cause combustion to<br>
occur within the cylinder 160. The electrical energy for<br>
the spark plug 4 50 is provided by the coil 300 (see Fig.<br>
3).<br>
[0041] Further referring to Fig. 7, and<br>
additionally to Fig. 8, elements of two valve trains<br>
4 60,461 of the engine 100 are shown. The valve trains<br>
460,461 respectively include the respective camshafts<br>
410,415 which include the respective gears 320,325 and<br>
also include respective single-lobe cams 360,365<br>
underneath the gears, respectively. Because each of the<br>
camshafts 410,415 includes only a single cam with a<br>
single lobe, the camshafts (in contrast to camshafts<br>
having multiple cams) can be easily molded or otherwise<br>
machined from single pieces of robust plastics or other<br>
materials. The use of such robust materials allows for<br>
quieter interaction of the cams 360,365 with respect to<br>
the respective push rods 340,345, and thus quieter<br>
operation of the engine 100 overall. In one embodiment,<br>
the cams 360,365 are integrally molded onto the<br>
respective backsides of the respective gears 320,325, and<br>
the camshafts 410,415 are identical to allow for even<br>
easier mass-production of the camshafts.<br>
[0042] Additionally, respective cam follower arms<br>
470,475 that are rotatably mounted to the crankcase 110<br>
extend to rest upon the respective cams 360,365. The<br>
respective push rods 340,345 in turn rest upon the<br>
respective cam follower arms 470,475. As the cams<br>
360,365 rotate, the push rods 340,345 are temporarily<br>
forced outward away from the crankcase 110 by the cam<br>
follower arms 470,475, which slidingly interface the<br>
rotating cams. This causes the rocker arms 350,355 to<br>
rock or rotate, and consequently causes the respective<br>
valves 240 and 250 to open toward the crankcase 110. As<br>
the cams 360,365 continue to rotate, however, the push<br>
rods 340,34 5 are allowed by the cam follower arms 470,475<br>
to return inward to their original positions.<br>
[0043] A pair of springs 480,490 positioned between<br>
the cylinder head 170' and the rocker arms 350,355 provide<br>
force tending to rock the rocker arms in directions<br>
tending to close the valves 240,250, respectively.<br>
Further as a result of this forcing action of the springs<br>
480,490 upon the rocker arms 350,355, the push rods<br>
340,345 are forced back to their original positions. The<br>
valve trains 460,461 are designed to have appropriate<br>
rocker ratios and masses to control contact stress levels<br>
with respect to the cams 360,365. Fig. 7 additionally<br>
shows that the components of the respective valve trains<br>
4 60,461 are positioned on opposite sides of the cylinder<br>
160 and cylinder head 170, thus exposing a valve bridge<br>
area 610.<br>
[0044] In the present embodiment, the engine 100 is<br>
a vertical shaft engine capable of outputting 15-20<br>
horsepower for implementation in a variety of consumer<br>
lawn and garden machinery such as lawn mowers. In<br>
alternate embodiments, the engine 100 can also be<br>
implemented as a horizontal shaft engine, be designed to<br>
output greater or lesser amounts of power, and/or be<br>
implemented in a variety of other types of machines,<br>
e.g., snow-blowers. Further, in alternate embodiments,<br>
the particular arrangement of parts within the engine 100<br>
can vary from those shown and discussed above. For<br>
example, in one alternate embodiment, the cams 360,365<br>
could be located above the gears 320,325 rather than<br>
underneath the gears.<br>
[0045] Referring still to Fig. 8, the camshafts<br>
410,415 have respective internal channels 500,505,<br>
through which oil or other lubricant can be communicated.<br>
The internal channel 500 in particular communicates oil<br>
upward from the pump 412 to the gear 320, while the<br>
internal channel 505 communicates oil downward from the<br>
gear 325 to the base of the camshaft 415, where that<br>
camshaft rests upon the floor 390 of the crankcase 110.<br>
As discussed more fully with reference to Fig. 16, the<br>
internal channels 500,505 form a portion of an overall<br>
oil circuit of the engine 100.<br>
[0046] Turning to Figs. 9 and 10, a top view and an<br>
elevation view (as viewed from the side wall 400 opposite<br>
the cylinder 160) of the bottom 370 of the crankcase 110<br>
are provided. Fig. 9 in particular shows the pump 412<br>
supported by the floor 390 of the crank-case. Further<br>
referring to Figs. 11-14, the pump 412 is shown in<br>
greater detail. As shown particularly with respect to<br>
Figs. 11-12, which are sectional views of the pump 412<br>
taken along lines 11-11 and 12-12 of Fig. 10,<br>
respectively, the pump in a preferred embodiment is a<br>
gerotor pump (or, alternatively, a crescent pump) of<br>
conventional design having an inner gear 510 positioned<br>
within an outer ring gear 515 having gear teeth along its<br>
inner circumference.<br>
[0047] As shown in Figs. 13-14, which are cross-<br>
sectional views taken along lines 13-13 and 14-14 of Fig.<br>
9, respectively, the inner gear 510 and the outer ring<br>
gear 515 are contained within a housing 520 that rests<br>
within a cavity 518 in the floor 390 of the crankcase<br>
3 10. In the embodiment shown, the gears 510,515<br>
specifically rest upon the floor 390, and the housing 520<br>
extends upward from the floor 390 around the gears.<br>
However, in alternate embodiments, the gears 510,515 are<br>
fully contained within the housing, which in turn rests<br>
upon the floor 390. The housing is made from a rigid<br>
material so that the dimensional envelope around the<br>
gears 510,515 is more accurate to provide improved<br>
performance of the pump 412.<br>
[0048] Particularly as shown in Figs. 11 and 13, the<br>
inner gear 510 has an interior hole 524 through which is<br>
positioned the camshaft 410. Thus, the internal channel<br>
500 of the camshaft 410 extends all of the way to a<br>
bottom side 528 of the inner gear 510. The inner gear<br>
510 is press fit onto, or otherwise coupled to, the<br>
camshaft 410. Consequently, when the camshaft 410 is<br>
driven to rotate, this causes the inner gear 510 and thus<br>
the outer ring gear 515 to rotate within the housing 520.<br>
The floor 390 of the crankcase 110 or, in alternate<br>
embodiments, a portion of the housing 520, supports the<br>
inner gear 510 and the camshaft 410 and consequently<br>
forms a lower camshaft bearing 555 for that camshaft.<br>
[0049] Referring to Fig. 12, as with other gerotor<br>
(or crescent) pumps, the inner gear 510 of the pump 412<br>
has a fewer number of gear teeth than the outer ring gear<br>
515 and the two gears have center axes that are somewhat<br>
offset from one another. Consequently, when the gears<br>
510 and 515 rotate, a partial vacuum is created within an<br>
inlet tube 525 of the pump 412 so that oil is drawn into<br>
the pump 412 from along the floor 390 of the crankcase<br>
outside the housing 520 at an inlet orifice 550.<br>
Further, referring also to Fig, 13, the oil that is drawn<br>
into the pump 412 due to operation of the pump in turn is<br>
pumped out of the pump at both an outlet 535 and a<br>
crankshaft bearing outlet 530.<br>
[0050] As shown in Figs. 11, 13 and 14, the outlet<br>
535 is formed by a slot 532 within the floor 390 of the<br>
crankcase 110 (or otherwise within the housing 520) that<br>
extends radially from between the inner and outer ring<br>
gears 510,515 under the inner gear to the interior hole<br>
524. Due to the positioning of the outlet 535, the inner<br>
gear 510, the camshaft 410 and the internal channel 500,<br>
some of the oil that is pumped out of the outlet<br>
lubricates the lower bearing 555 of the shaft/inner gear.<br>
Other oil that is pumped out of the outlet 535 is pumped<br>
up through the internal channel 500 of the camshaft 410.<br>
This oil provides lubrication for a number of other<br>
components of the engine 100, as discussed further with<br>
respect to Figs. 16-17.<br>
[0051] As shown in both Figs. 12 and 14, the<br>
crankshaft bearing outlet 530 is a tube that extends from<br>
the pump 412 along the top of the pump almost to the<br>
lower crankshaft bearing 540 for supporting the<br>
crankshaft 220. An additional connecting device 585 is<br>
employed to connect the crankshaft bearing outlet 530 to<br>
the lower crankshaft bearing 540 and further through an<br>
orifice 587 in the bearing to the interior of the<br>
bearing, thus completing an oil passage from the pump 412<br>
to the bearing 540. The connecting device 585 in one<br>
embodiment is a rubberized tube having a first end 590<br>
designed to extend into the crankshaft bearing outlet<br>
530, and a second end 592 designed to fit into the<br>
orifice 587. Oil flows through the connecting device 585<br>
from the crankshaft bearing outlet 530 into the lower<br>
crankshaft bearing 540. In the embodiment shown in Fig.<br>
14, the crankshaft bearing outlet 530 also includes a<br>
pressure relief valve 594 that allows oil to exit out of<br>
the crankshaft bearing outlet 530 by way of a hole 597 in<br>
that outlet, so that oil can exit the system if oil<br>
pressure becomes excessive. In the embodiment shown, the<br>
valve 594 includes a ball 596 and spring 599, although<br>
other types of valves can also be employed.<br>
[0052] Referring to Fig. 15, an exploded view of an<br>
alternate embodiment of oil passage to that of Figs. 12<br>
and 14 is shown. Specifically, Fig. 15 shows an<br>
alternate connecting device 685 that connects the<br>
crankshaft bearing outlet 530 and the bearing 540.<br>
Specifically, the connecting device 685 has a first end<br>
690 that is separated from a second end 692 by a rim 696<br>
extending out from the connecting device in between the<br>
first and second ends. The rim 696 keeps the connecting<br>
device 685 in position relative to the crankshaft bearing<br>
outlet 530 and the lower crankshaft bearing 540. The<br>
first end 690 is sufficiently long that it extends past<br>
the hole 597, and a ball-and-spring valve 694 (or another<br>
type of valve) is supported by the first end 690 at a<br>
location that is aligned with the hole 597 when the<br>
connecting device 685 is inserted into the outlet 530.<br>
[0053] Referring to Fig. 16, a block diagram shows<br>
schematically an overall oil circuit 545 of the engine<br>
100 by which, oil is pumped from the floor 390 of the<br>
crankcase 110 to various components within the engine.<br>
As shown, oil is drawn into the inlet tube 525 at the<br>
inlet orifice 550, which forms an oil pick-up along the<br>
floor 390 of the crankcase 110. The oil is then provided<br>
to the oil pump 412. In the embodiment shown, the oil<br>
pump 412 pumps some of the oil out at the outlet 535 at<br>
the lower camshaft bearing 555 for the camshaft 410, and<br>
pumps the remainder of the oil out through the crankshaft<br>
bearing outlet 530. The oil pumped out of the crankshaft<br>
bearing outlet 530 in turn is provided, by way of the<br>
connecting device 585 (or the connecting device 685), to<br>
the lower crankshaft bearing 540 and/or back to the floor<br>
390 of the crankcase 110 (outside of the pump 412) by way<br>
of the pressure relief valve 594 (or valve 694) and hole<br>
597. In alternate embodiments, some of the oil is pumped<br>
out at the outlet 535, while the remainder of the oil is<br>
pumped elsewhere to locations other than, or in addition<br>
to, the crankshaft bearing outlet 530. In further<br>
alternate embodiments, all of the oil is pumped out at<br>
the outlet 535.<br>
[0054] Most of the oil pumped out at the outlet 535<br>
does not remain at the lower camshaft bearing 555 but<br>
rather proceeds up through the internal channel 500 of<br>
the camshaft 410 and out along an upper camshaft bearing<br>
565 of that camshaft. Most of the oil then proceeds<br>
through the incoming line 270 to the oil filter 260, at<br>
which the oil is filtered. Once filtered, the oil<br>
proceeds through the outgoing line 280. Some of the oil<br>
is deposited at an upper crankshaft bearing 570, while<br>
some of the oil further proceeds along an additional line<br>
5 98 to an upper camshaft bearing 575 of the shaft 415. A<br>
portion of that oil further then proceeds down the<br>
internal channel 505 of the shaft 415 to the remaining,<br>
lower camshaft bearing 580 of that shaft along the bottom<br>
370 of the crankcase 110.<br>
[0055] Fig. 17 shows an interior side 600 of the<br>
top 290 of the crankcase 110 to further clarify the<br>
design of the oil circuit 545. In particular, the upper<br>
camshaft bearings 565,575 for supporting the respective<br>
camshafts 410,415 and the upper crankshaft bearing 570<br>
for supporting the crankshaft 220 are shown. Also shown<br>
are indentations 602,604 and 606 molded in the top 290 to<br>
form the incoming, outgoing and additional lines 270,280<br>
and 598 that respectively couple the upper camshaft<br>
bearing 565 with the oil filter 260, and couple the oil<br>
filter with the upper crankshaft bearing 570 and with the<br>
upper camshaft bearing 575. The indentations 602,604 and<br>
606 are semicircular in cross section, and the lines<br>
270,280 and 598 are formed by covering the indentations<br>
with a panel 601.<br>
[0056] Although the panel 601 can be flat, in the<br>
embodiment shown the panel has grooves 605,607 and 609<br>
that complement the indentations 602,604 and 606 to form<br>
the lines 27 0,280 and 598, respectively. The panel 601<br>
can be attached to the top 290 by way of screws or other<br>
fastening components or methods. The exact paths of the<br>
incoming and outgoing lines 270,280 shown in Fig. 8 are<br>
somewhat different than those shown in Fig. 7, insofar as<br>
the. paths shown in Fig. 7 are straight while those of<br>
Fig. 8 are more curved. Thus, depending upon the<br>
embodiment, the incoming, outgoing, and additional lines<br>
270,280 and 598 can follow a variety of different<br>
paths. This manner of creating the lines 270,280 and 598<br>
by way of molded indentations and the panel 601 is<br>
simpler and more cost-effective than alternative methods<br>
in which enclosed channels are fully cast into the top<br>
290 through the use of cores, metal tubes, etc., or<br>
drilled, although the lines could be created using such<br>
other methods in alternate embodiments.<br>
[0057] Referring again to Fig. 16 and additionally<br>
to Fig. 18, the oil provided to the upper and lower<br>
crankshaft bearings 570,540 serves both to lubricate the<br>
crankshaft bearings themselves as well, as to lubricate<br>
other bearings along the length of the crankshaft 220.<br>
As shown in Fig. 18, each of an upper shaft bearing<br>
portion 7 00 and a lower shaft bearing portion 710 along<br>
the crankshaft 220 includes a respective annular concave<br>
groove 712 into which oil is delivered by way of the<br>
upper and lower crankshaft bearings 570,540 (e.g., by way<br>
of holes in those bearings). Upper and lower bores 7 08<br>
and 718 drilled within the crankshaft 220 respectively<br>
extend from the respective grooves 712 of the upper and<br>
lower shaft bearing portions 700,710 through upper and<br>
lower crankarms 720 and 730, respectively, to an internal<br>
channel 724 extending within a crankpin 701 of the<br>
crankshaft generally parallel to a central axis 726 of<br>
the crankshaft: 220.<br>
[0058] As shown, the upper and lower bores 708,718<br>
extend at oblique angles between the grooves 712 and the<br>
crankpin 701, relative to the central axis 72 6. By<br>
drilling the bores 708,718 in this manner, each of the<br>
bores 708,718 can respectively be formed simply by<br>
drilling a single straight hole. Nevertheless, in the<br>
embodiment shown, three other bores must be drilled in<br>
order to communicate oil to three different locations<br>
along the crankshaft 220. First, the crankpin 701<br>
includes a first additional bore 715 that connects the<br>
internal channel 724 to an outer surface of the crankpin<br>
that forms a crankpin bearing 702. Thus, oil provided to<br>
the internal channel 724 by way of the upper and lower<br>
bores 708,718 in turn is communicated to the outside of<br>
the crankpin 7 01 to provide lubrication to the crankpin<br>
bearing 702.<br>
[0059] Also as shown in Fig. 18, the crankshaft 220<br>
includes.first and second eccentric bearings 704 and 706,<br>
respectively, which support the one or more<br>
counterbalances 440. The first eccentric bearing 704<br>
specifically is positioned along the crankshaft 220<br>
between the upper crankarm 720 and the upper shaft<br>
bearing portion 700, while the second eccentric bearing<br>
706 is positioned between the lower crankarm 7 30 and the<br>
lower shaft bearing portion 710. In order to provide oil<br>
to the first and second eccentric bearings 704 and 706,<br>
second and third additional bores 722 and 732,<br>
respectively, are drilled to link the respective upper<br>
and lower; bores 7 08,718 with the upper and lower<br>
eccentric bearings, respectively.<br>
[0060] The first, second, and third additional bores<br>
715,722 and 732 generally are oriented so that the bores<br>
reach the surfaces of the crankpin bearing 702, first<br>
eccentric bearing 704, and second eccentric bearing 706<br>
proximate side edges of those bearings. That is, the<br>
bores 715,722 and 732 are generally oriented so that the<br>
bores do not reach the surfaces of the bearings near the<br>
portions of the bearings that are most distant from, or<br>
least distant from, the central axis 726. These<br>
orientations of the bores 715,722 and 732 are chosen so<br>
that, during operation of the engine, pressure applied to<br>
the bearings by the connecting rod 420 or counterbalances<br>
440 does not undesirably limit or excessively enhance oil<br>
flow out of the bores.<br>
[0061] Fig. 16 shows in schematic form that oil<br>
pumped to the upper and lower crank main bearings 570 and<br>
540 in turn is pumped through each of the upper and lower-<br>
bores 708,718 toward the crankpin bearing 702 by way of<br>
the internal channel 7 24 and the first additional bore<br>
715, and additionally is pumped through the second and<br>
third additional bores 722,732 to the upper and lower<br>
eccentric bearings 704,706. Although the embodiment of<br>
Fig. 16 provides dual oil flow paths to the crankshaft<br>
220 via each of the upper and lower crank main bearings<br>
570,540, in alternate embodiments, a single flow path<br>
would suffice. For example, if oil were no longer pumped<br>
via the connecting device 585 to the lower crank main<br>
bearing 54 0, the crankshaft 220 would still be provided<br>
with oil via the upper crank main bearing 570 and,<br>
additionally, the lower crank main bearing 540 would<br>
still be provided with oil via the upper and lower bores<br>
708,718 and the internal channel 724. Such an alternate<br>
flow path could be desirable in circumstances where it<br>
was desired that all oil provided to the crankshaft 220<br>
be filtered via the oil filter 260 prior to being<br>
provided to the crankshaft.<br>
[0062] The embodiments discussed above have various<br>
advantages in comparison with conventional systems. In<br>
particular, because oil is conducted through the<br>
camshafts 410 and 415, oil passages do not need to be<br>
cast or otherwise created in the sides of the walls of<br>
the crankcase in order to provide oil from the floor of<br>
the crankcase to the bearings along the top of the<br>
crankcase. Further, because the top 290 is removable and<br>
can be simply manufactured to include the incoming,<br>
outgoing and additional lines, the costs associated with<br>
manufacturing the oil circuit providing oil to the oil<br>
filter and to the various bearings along the top of the<br>
crankcase are further reduced in comparison with<br>
conventional designs. Also, given the ability of the<br>
crankshaft 220 to conduct oil between the upper and lower<br>
crank main bearings 570,540, only one of the upper and<br>
lower crank main bearings needs to be supplied by oil via<br>
the outgoing line 280 or the connecting device 585,<br>
respectively.<br>
[0063] Also, since the first and second camshafts<br>
410,415 including the gears 320,325 and the cams 360,365<br>
are respectively identical, and each camshaft includes<br>
only a single cam, these parts can be inexpensively<br>
manufactured by way of injection molding, from materials<br>
such as robust plastics that produce relatively little<br>
noise during operation of the engine as the cams<br>
interface the push rods of the engine. Additionally, the<br>
twin-cam design has the added benefit that the push rods,<br>
rocker arms and valves corresponding to the intake and<br>
exhaust valves are positioned on opposite sides of the<br>
cylinder and cylinder head, such that the valve bridge<br>
area 610 is more exposed to air being blown by the fan<br>
and therefore is more effectively cooled.<br>
[0064] Further, the providing of oil to the upper<br>
and lower eccentric bearings 704,706 via the second and<br>
third additional bores 722,732 allows for smoother and<br>
more efficient operation of the counterbalances 440 that<br>
ride upon those eccentric bearings in comparison with<br>
designs that do not directly pump oil to those bearings.<br>
The present invention is intended to encompass other<br>
designs of crankshaft oil circuits in which oil is pumped<br>
to eccentric bearing surfaces for supporting balance<br>
weights via bores or other channels, regardless of<br>
whether such crankshaft oil circuits employ the specific<br>
bores (e.g., the upper and lower bores 708,718) shown in<br>
FIG. 18.<br>
[0065] In this regard, a second embodiment of a<br>
crankshaft 820 and component parts is shown in Figs. 19-<br>
21. Fig. 19 in particular provides an exploded,<br>
perspective view of the components of the crankshaft 820<br>
and the counterbalances 440, while Fig. 20 provides a<br>
cross-sectional view of these components when fully<br>
assembled. As shown, the crankshaft 820 includes a pair<br>
of main segments 810, a crank pin 820, and a pair of<br>
crank arms 830 that respectively couple the crank pin to<br>
the respective main segments. When assembled within the<br>
engine 100, the connecting rod 420 connects the crank pin<br>
820 to the piston 210 (see Fig. 7). The rotating<br>
counterweight 430 is formed by a pair of weights that are<br>
respective extensions of the respective crank arms 830,<br>
diametrically opposite from the crank pin 820 across a<br>
central axis 840 of the crankshaft 820. In alternate<br>
embodiments, the rotating counterweight 430 need not<br>
include two separate weights, and need not be integrally<br>
formed as part of the crank arms 830.<br>
[0066] Further as shown in Figs. 19 and 20, flanges<br>
850 having eccentric rims 860 are respectively positioned<br>
onto the respective main segments 810. When fully<br>
assembled onto the crankshaft 820, the flanges 850 are<br>
respectively positioned so that respective inner edges<br>
945 of the flanges abut respective outer sides 8 65 of the<br>
crank arms 830. In the present embodiment, the flanges<br>
850 each include a respective protrusion 855 that extends<br>
radially outward away from the central axis 840.<br>
Specifically, the respective protrusions 855 extend<br>
alongside the respective outer sides 865 of the crank<br>
arms 830. Further, respective outer edges 965 (see Fig.<br>
21) of the flanges 850 surround, and are supported by and<br>
in contact with (e.g., abut), the respective main<br>
segments 810. The pair of counterbalances 440, each of<br>
which has a weight portion 870 and a coupling arm 880<br>
with a circular cavity 890, are also fit onto the<br>
crankshaft 820, such that the circular cavities 890<br>
respectively fit around the eccentric rims 860. Due to<br>
the eccentric rims 860, the center axes of the circular<br>
cavities 590 (not shown) are displaced from the central<br>
axis 840. Consequently, when the crankshaft 820 rotates,<br>
the counterbalances 440 move toward and away from the<br>
crankshaft, and act as a balance of some of the forces of<br>
the reciprocating piston 210. The two counterbalances<br>
440 are held together by a pin 900. Also, the flanges<br>
850 are held against the crank arms 830 by way of an<br>
additional pin 910.<br>
[0067] Further as shown, a crankshaft oil circuit is<br>
provided with respect to the crankshaft 820 to allow<br>
lubricant to flow along the entire length of the<br>
crankshaft unimpeded by the existence of the crank arms<br>
830 and the crank pin 820, and also to provide<br>
lubrication of the interface between the crank pin 820<br>
and the connecting rod 420 as well as the interfaces<br>
between the eccentric rims 8 60 and the circular cavities<br>
890. Figs. 19 and 20 show that the crank pin 820<br>
includes a channel or oil galley 920 (also termed an oil<br>
gallery) through which lubricant is able to flow. The<br>
oil galley 820 can be simply formed within the crank pin<br>
820 during casting of the crank pin. When supported by<br>
the crank arms 830, the crank pin 820 and its oil galley<br>
920 extend the entire distance between the outer sides<br>
8 65 of the crank arms. In alternate embodiments, the<br>
crank pin only extends up to the crank arms or partly<br>
through the crank arms rather than the entire distance<br>
between the outer sides 865. In such embodiments, the<br>
crank arms 830 additionally are formed with holes that<br>
extend the oil galley 920 to the outer sides 865 of the<br>
crank arms. Also, while the crank pin 820 is typically a<br>
part that is distinct from the respective crank arms 830,<br>
in certain embodiments the crank pin and one or both of<br>
the crank arms are integrally formed as a single part.<br>
[0068] [Referring additionally to Fig. 21, which<br>
provides an elevation view of one of the flanges 8 50,<br>
each of the flanges includes a first groove 930 along the<br>
respective outer edge 965 of the flange, and also<br>
includes a second groove 940 along the respective inner<br>
edge 94 5 and the respective protrusion 8 55 of the flange.<br>
When the flanges 850 are positioned on the main segments<br>
810 of the crankshaft 820 -to abut the respective crank<br>
arms 830, the first grooves 930 extend in directions<br>
parallel to the central axis 840 from the respective<br>
inner edges 945 of the flanges to the ends of the<br>
flanges, e.g., to respective exterior portions 815 of the<br>
main segments 810. The second grooves 940 respectively<br>
extend radially outward from the respective outer edges<br>
965 of the flanges 850, sufficiently far that the second<br>
grooves reach the corresponding open ends of.the oil<br>
galley 920.<br>
[0069] The first and second grooves 930,940 of each<br>
flange 8 50 are coupled to one another at the location<br>
where the inner, and outer edges 945,965 of the flange<br>
meet. Consequently, when the respective flanges 850 are<br>
positioned onto the respective main segments 810, such<br>
that the outer edges 965 abut the main segments 810 and<br>
the inner edges 945 abut the outer sides 865 of the<br>
respective crank arms 830, respective passages 935 are<br>
formed by the respective sets of grooves 930,940 (as<br>
shown best in Fig. 20). Lubricant such as oil 970 is<br>
therefore able to flow through the passages 935 between<br>
the exterior portions 815 of the main segments 810 and<br>
the oil galley 920. Lubricant is able to arrive at the<br>
passages 935 when provided by way of the crank main<br>
bearings 570,540 to the exterior portions 815 of the main<br>
segments (which correspond to portions 700,710 shown in<br>
Fig. 18), since some of the lubricant that is provided to<br>
those portions 815 proceeds into the passages 935.<br>
[0070] As shown in Fig. 20, in the present<br>
embodiment, an additional channel 950 connecting the oil<br>
galley 920 to the exterior of the crank pin 820 is also<br>
provided. The additional channel 950 allows oil to flow<br>
also between the oil galley 920 and the outer surface 925<br>
(or crank pin bearing) of the crank pin 820, thereby<br>
allowing for lubrication of the interface between the<br>
crank pin and the connecting rod 420. Although in Fig.<br>
20, the additional channel 950 is shown to proceed<br>
outward from the oil galley 920 toward the portion of the<br>
outer surface 925 that is farthest from the central axis<br>
840, in alternate embodiments the channel will proceed<br>
toward a portion of the outer surface that is<br>
intermediate the portions that are farthest from and<br>
closest to the central axis 840, so that oil flow to the<br>
outer surface 925 is not impeded or overly enhanced due<br>
to the interaction between the connecting rod 420 and the<br>
outer surface.<br>
[0071] As further shown in Fig. 21, in certain<br>
embodiments, the flanges 850 include one or more<br>
additional channels that allow some of the oil provided<br>
through channels 935 to flow outward onto the eccentric<br>
rims 860. For example, in one embodiment, each flange<br>
8 50 includes a first outlet 923 that is generally<br>
directed parallel to the central axis 840 along the first<br>
groove 930 linking the eccentric rim 8 60 of the flange<br>
850 with the second groove 940. In another embodiment,<br>
each flange 850 includes a second outlet 926 that is<br>
generally perpendicular to the central axis 840 and also<br>
perpendicular to the second groove 940 that connects the<br>
second groove to the eccentric rim 8 60. This embodiment<br>
is preferred to the preceding embodiment insofar the oil<br>
is not delivered to either the portion of the eccentric<br>
rim 860 that is closed to the central axis 840 or the<br>
portion of the eccentric rim that is farthest from the<br>
central axis. Consequently, as discussed above with<br>
respect to the embodiment shown in Fig. 18, oil is<br>
neither excessively prevented from flowing out onto the<br>
eccentric rim 8 60 or excessively encouraged to flow onto<br>
the eccentric rim. In alternate embodiments, the<br>
eccentric rims 8 60 could instead include one or more<br>
passages connecting the grooves 930 to the eccentric<br>
rims. In further alternate embodiments, several of the<br>
above, passages could be created.<br>
[0072] Referring again to Fig. 16 in addition to<br>
Figs. 19-21, certain components of the crankshaft 820<br>
correspond to and perform the same general functions as<br>
the components 702,704,706,708,715,718,722,724 and 732<br>
shown in Fig 16. Specifically, the crankpin bearing 702<br>
and eccentric bearings 704,706 respectively correspond to<br>
the outer surface 925 and the eccentric rims 860 of the<br>
first and second flanges 850. Additionally, the upper<br>
and lower bores 708,718 of Fig. 16 (as well as Fig. 18)<br>
respectively are replaced by the passages 935 of the<br>
respective flanges 850 as formed by the inner and outer<br>
grooves 930,94 0 of each respective flange. The oil<br>
galley 920 of the crankshaft 820 corresponds to the<br>
internal channel 72 4, and the additional channel 950<br>
corresponds to the first additional bore 715. Finally,<br>
one or both of the first and second outlets 923,926 (or<br>
other passages, depending upon the embodiment) of each<br>
respective flange 8 50 corresponds to the second and third<br>
additional bores 722,732 of Figs. 16 and 18.<br>
[0073] Although the engine 100 shown in Figs. 1-8 is<br>
a vertical crankshaft engine, the oil circuit described<br>
with respect to Figs. 9-21 can be employed in its present<br>
or modified forms in a variety of engines having either<br>
vertical or horizontal crankshafts. With respect to<br>
horizontal crankshaft engines, the oil can flow through<br>
the crankshaft oil circuit because it is pumped, because<br>
of a slightly tipped orientation of the engine, or by way<br>
of other methods known in the art. Although pumping of<br>
the oil can also be employed with respect to vertical<br>
crankshaft engines, gravity alone is often sufficient to<br>
cause oil to flow downward along/through the crankshafts<br>
220,820, through their various passages shown in Figs.<br>
18-21 (e.g., passages 709,718,724,722,732,715,935,920.,<br>
etc.).<br>
[0074] In alternate embodiments, the exact shapes of<br>
crankshafts 220,820 and components of the crankshafts<br>
such as the passages formed by the bores 708,718, the<br>
flanges 850, the protrusions 855, and the first and<br>
second grooves 930,940 can be modified from those shown<br>
in Figs. 18-21. For example, the flanges 850 could have,<br>
in one alternate embodiment, a cross-sectional shape<br>
(viewed perpendicular to the central axis 840)that is<br>
identical to the outer sides 8 65 of the crank arms 8 30 to<br>
which the flanges are attached. Additionally,<br>
complementary grooves can be provided in the main<br>
segments 810 and/or the crank arms 830 to interface the<br>
first and second grooves 930,940 or, in further<br>
embodiments, the grooves are entirely provided as<br>
indentations in the exterior surfaces of the main<br>
segments and the crank arms 830, while the inner and<br>
outer edges 945,965 of the flanges 850 remain flat. In<br>
further alternate embodiments, the first and second<br>
grooves 930,940 can be replaced with first and second<br>
channels that are fully enclosed within the flanges 8 50<br>
or other components.<br>
[0075] Also in certain alternate embodiments,<br>
lubrication is provided to the outer surface 925 forming<br>
the interface between the connecting rod 420 and the<br>
crank pin 820 in another manner, such that the additional<br>
channel 950 is not required. In further alternate<br>
embodiments, the oil galley 920 need not have a strictly<br>
cylindrical shape, nor need the oil galley extend fully<br>
between the two outer sides 8 65. For example, in certain<br>
embodiments, the purpose of the crankshaft oil circuit<br>
will be simply to allow lubricant to flow between the oil<br>
galley and one of the main segments 810, rather than to<br>
allow lubricant to flow from one main segment, past the<br>
crank pin and crank arms, to the other main segment.<br>
[0076] Additionally, while in the present<br>
embodiment, the flanges 850 serve both the purpose of<br>
creating a crankshaft oil circuit and the purpose of<br>
supporting the counterbalances 440, in alternate<br>
embodiments, two distinct parts can be employed for these<br>
separate purposes. Further, oil circuits such as the<br>
present embodiment can be employed in engines that are<br>
not single-cylinder engines, that is, engines that do not<br>
require counterbalances 440 and consequently do not<br>
require the flanges 850 to support the counterbalances.<br>
For example, in one alternate, embodiment, the oil galley<br>
920 would be coupled to the main segments 810 by passages<br>
935 formed by flanges or other components positioned next<br>
to the crank arms 830, where these components; did not<br>
have the eccentric rims 860. Also, such multi-cylinder<br>
engines could employ one or more crankshafts having one<br>
or more crank pins and sets of crank arms, all or any<br>
subset, of which could employ passages/channels/oil<br>
galleys as described above to form one or more oil<br>
circuits.<br>
[0077] While the foregoing specification<br>
illustrates and describes the preferred embodiments of<br>
this invention, it is to be understood that the invention<br>
is not limited to the precise construction herein<br>
disclosed. The invention can be embodied in other<br>
specific forms without departing from the spirit or<br>
essential attributes of the invention. For example,<br>
other types of pumps can be employed in place of the<br>
gerotor/crescent pumps shown. Accordingly, reference<br>
should be made to the following claims, rather than to<br>
the foregoing specification, as indicating the scope of<br>
