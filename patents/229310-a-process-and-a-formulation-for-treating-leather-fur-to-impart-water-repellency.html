Imparting water repellency to leather and For SKins<br>
The present invention relates to a process for imparting water repeilency to leather and fur skins, wherein leather or fur skin is treated, before, during or after the retanning, with one or more formulations comprising from 1 to 30% by weight, based on the fomiulation, of a mixture of polysiloxanes comprising<br>
from 10 to 90% by weight, based on the mixture, of one or more carboxyl-containing polysiloxanes,<br>
from 90 to 10% by weight, based on the mixture, of one or more carboxyl-free polysiloxanes<br>
and from 3 to 25% by weight, based on the formulation, of at least one emulsifier.<br>
EP 0 213 480 B discloses a process for imparting water repeilency to leather and fur skins, in which an aqueous emulsion of a silicone oil or an anhydrous mixture of a silicone oil and an alkanolamine salt of an amino acid is allowed to act on leather or skins before, during or after the retanning. Examples of polysiloxanes are: dimethylpolysiloxane in which 3% of the methyl groups have been replaced by mercaptopropyl (examples 1 to 7), dimethylpolysiloxane having a viscosity from 80 to 110 mPas, phenylmethylpolysiloxanes having a viscosity from 85 to 120 mPas and dimethylpolysiloxanes having on average from 2 to 10 carboxyl groups per molecule. The performance characteristics of such water repellent formulations can however still be improved. Furthermore, the leathers produced with the aid of the polysiloxanes disclosed can in some cases also be improved with regard to performance characteristics,<br>
WO 95/22627 discloses a process for imparting water repeilency to leather and fur skins using carboxyl-containing polysiloxanes in aqueous emulsion, in which polysiloxanes which are branched in a comb-like manner and may have the formula A are used:<br>
COOH<br>
I<br>
A I<br>
The structural units may, for example, be randomly distributed. The variables are defined as follows:<br><br>
R are identical or different and, independently of one another, are hydrogen, hydroxy!,<br>
C1-C4-alkyl, phenyl, CrC4-alkoxy, amino, mono- or di-C1-C4-amino, chlorine or fluorine,<br>
it also being possible in each case for a radical R to be the group Z-A-COOH at the<br>
chain ends;<br>
A is a linear or branched C5-C25-alkylene group and<br>
Z is a direct bond, an oxygen atom or an amino, carbonyl, amido or ester group.<br>
On average, preferably from 2.5 to 15 carboxyl groups are present per molecule (page 4, line 17).<br>
Leather and fur skin treated with the aid of such comb-like polysiloxanes generally have very good water repellency.<br>
WO 98/04748 discloses a process for retanning leathers produced using polymeric tanning agents and, if required, aldehyde tanning agents, which leathers are treated with polymer tanning agents and with comb-like polysiloxanes of the fomriula A defined above.<br>
EP-A1 087 021 discloses that leather treatment compositions comprising a combination of polysiloxanes substituted by carboxyl or carboxyiic anhydride groups at the Î±,-position, the carboxyl groups of the polysiloxane being present in neutralized form, with certain amphiphilic polymers, an emulsifier and an oil or wax are suitable as leather treatment compositions. With the aid of the combination products disclosed, full and soft leathers which were readily washable were produced.<br>
However, it is observed that leather and fur skin obtained according to the publications cited above have in many cases a dyeing with an undesirably low degree of levelness. Moreover, the high price of the polysiloxanes branched in a comb-like manner is to be regarded as disadvantageous.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a process for the production of leather and fur skins which does not have the abovementioned disadvantages. It is furthermore an object of the present invention to provide leather having advantageous performance characteristics.<br>
It is moreover an object of the present invention to provide novel formulations having advantageous performance characteristics.<br>
We have found that this object is achieved by the process defined at the outset. According to the invention, leather is treated with a formulation before, during or after the retanning.<br><br>
At least one formulation used in the novel process comprises from 1 to 30, preferably from 5 to 20, particularly preferably from 7 to 12.5, % by weight, based on the weight of the formulation, of a mixture of two or more polysiloxanes.<br>

with corresponding alcohols, which need not be present in pure form, followed by a reaction with disulfite.<br>
Instead of pure sulfur-containing compounds, for example sulfur-containing compounds of the formula V, it is possible to use mixtures of different sulfur-containing compounds.
