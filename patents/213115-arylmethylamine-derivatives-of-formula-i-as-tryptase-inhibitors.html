FIELD OF THE IMVENTIQN This invention is directed to substituted arylmethylamines, their preparation, pharmaceutical compositions containing these compounds, and their pharmaceutical use in the treatment of disease states capable of being modulated by the inhibition of tryptase.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Tryptase is stored in mast cell secretory granules and is the major secretory protease of human mast cells. Tryptase has been implicated in a variety of biological processes, including degradation of vasodilating and bronchorelaxing neuropeptides (Caughey, et al., J. Pharmacol. Exp, Ther., 1988, 244, pages 133-137; Franconi, et al., J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther., 1988, 248, pages 947-951; and Tarn, et a!., Am, J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol., 1990, 3, pages 27-32) and modulation of bronchial responsiveness to histamine(Sekizawa,et al., J.Clin. Invest,, 1989, 83, pages 175-179). As a result, tryptase inhibitors may be useful as anti-inflammatory agents (K Rice, P.A. Sprengler, Current Opinion in Drug Discovery and Development, 1999, 2(5), pages 463-474) particularly in the treatment of chronic asthma (M.Q. Zhang, H. Timmerman, Mediators Inflamm., 1997, 112, pages 311-317) and may also be useful in treating or preventing allergic rhinitis (S. J. Wilson et al, Clin. Exp. Allergy, 1998, 28, pages 220-227), inflammatory bowel disease (S.C. Bischoff et al, Histopathology, 1996, 28, pages 1-13), psoriasis (A. Naukkarinen et al. Arch. Dermatol. Res., 1993, 285, pages 341-346), conjunctivitis (A.A.Irani et al, J. Allergy Clin. Immunol., 1990, 86, pages 34-40), atopic dermatitis (A. Jarvikallio et al, Br, J. Dermatol., 1997, 136, pages 871-877), rheumatoid arthritis (L.C Tetlow et al, Ann. Rheum. Dis., 1998, 54, pages 549-555), osteoarthritis (M.G. Buckley et al, J. PathoL, 1998, 186, pages 67-74), gouty arthritis, rheumatoid spondylitis, and diseases of joint cartilage destruction.<br>
In addition, tryptase has been shown to be a potent mitogen for fibroblasts, suggesting its involvement in the pulmonary fibrosis in asthma and interstitial lung diseases (Ruoss et al., J. Clin. Invest., 1991, SS, pages 493-499). Therefore, tryptase inhibitors may be useful in treating or preventing fibrotic conditions (J.A. Cairns and A.F. Walls, J. Clin. Invest., 1997, 99, pages 1313-1321) for example, fibrosis, sceleroderma, pulmonary fibrosis, liver cirrhosis, myocardial fibrosis, neurofibromas and hypertrophic scars.<br>
Additionally, tryptase inhibitors may be useful in treating or preventing myocardial infarction, stroke, angina and other consequences of atherosclerotic plaque rupture (M. Jeziorska et al, J. Pathol., 1997, 182, pages 115-122).   Tryptase has also been discovered to activate prostromelysin that in turn activates collagenase, thereby initiating the destruction of cartilage and periodontal connective tissue, respectively. Therefore, tryptase inhibitors could be useful in the treatment or prevention of arthritis, periodontal disease, diabetic retinopathy, and tumor growth (W.J. Beil et al, Exp. Hematol., (1998) 26,<br><br>
pages 158-169), Also, tryptase inhibitors may be useful in the treatment of anaphylaxis (L.B. Schwarz et al, J. Clin. Invest., 1995, 96, pages 2702-2710), multiple sclerosis (M. Steinhoff et al, Nat. Med. (N, Y.), 2000, 6(2), pages 151-158), peptic ulcers and syncytial viral infections.<br>
Mast cell mediated inflammatory conditions, in particular asthma, are a growing public health concern. Asthma is frequently characterized by progressive development of hyper-responsiveness of the trachea and bronchi to both immunospecific allergens and generalized chemical or physical stimuli, which lead to the onset of chronic inflammation. Leukocytes containing IgE receptors, notably mast cells and basophils, are present in the epithelium and underlying smooth muscle tissues of bronchi. These leukocytes initially become activated by .binding of specific inhaled antigens to the IgE receptors and then release a number of chemical mediators. For example, degranulation of mast cells leads to the release of proteoglycans, peroxidase, arylsulfatase B, tryptase and chymase, which results in bronchiole constriction.<br>
Accordingly, what is needed is a novel and useful group of compounds having valuable pharmaceutical properties, particularly, the ability to inhibit tryptase. Such compounds readily have utility in treating a patient suffering condition that can be ameliorated by the administration of an inhibitor of tryptase, e,g., mast cell mediated inflammatory conditions, inflammation, and diseases or disorders related to the degradation of vasodilating and bronchorelaxing neuropeptides. Particular examples of such conditions are described infra.<br>

C. S. Symposium Series, and in Edward B. Roche, ed., Bioreversible Carriers in Drug Design, American Pharmaceutical Association and Pergamon Press, 1987, both of which are incorporated herein by reference. For example an ester of a compound of the present invention containing a hydroxy group may be convertible by hydrolysis in vivo to the parent molecule.   Alternatively an ester of a compound of the present invention containing a carboxy group may be convertible by hydrolysis in vivo to the parent molecule.<br>
Suitable esters of compounds of present invention containing a hydroxy group, are for example acetates, citrates, lactates, tartrates, maionates, oxalates, salicylates, propionates, succinates, fumarates, maleates, methylene-bis-p-hydroxynaphthoates, gentisates, isethionates, di-p-toluoyltartrates, methanesulfonates, ethanesulfonates, benzenesulfonates, p-toluenesulfonates, cyclohexylsulfamates and quinates.<br>
An especially useful class of esters of compounds of the present invention containing a hydroxy group, may be formed from acid moieties selected from those described by Bundgaard et al,, J. Med. Chem., 1989, 32, page 2503-2507, and include substituted (aminomethyl)-benzoates, for example dialkylamino-methylbenzoates in which the two alkyl groups may be joined together and/or interrupted by an oxygen atom or by an optionally substituted nitrogen atom, e.g. an alkylated nitrogen atom, more especially (morpholino-methyl)benzoates, e.g. 3- or 4-(morpholinomethyl)-benzoates, and (4-alkylpiperazin-l-yl)benzoates, e.g. 3- or 4-(4-alkylpiperazin-l-yl)benzoates.<br>
Suitable esters of compounds of the present invention containing a carboxy group, are for example those described by F.J.Leinweber, Drug Metab. Res., 1987,18, page 379.<br>
The compounds of the present invention are basic, and such compounds are useful in the form of the free base or in the form of a pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt thereof<br>
Acid addition salts are a more convenient form for use; and in practice, use of the salt form inherently amounts to use of the free base form. The acids which can be used to prepare the acid addition salts include preferably those which produce, when combined with the free base, pharmaceutically acceptable salts, that is, salts whose anions are non-toxic to the patient in pharmaceutical doses of the salts, so that the beneficial inhibitory effects inherent in the free base are not vitiated by side effects ascribable to the anions. Although pharmaceutically acceptable salts of said basic compounds are preferred, all acid addition salts are useful as sources of the free base form even if the particular salt, per se, is desired only as an intermediate product as, for example, when the salt is formed only for<br><br>
purposes of purification, and identification, or when it is used as intermediate in preparing a pharmaceutically acceptable salt by ion exchange procedures. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts within the scope of the invention include those derived from mineral acids and organic acids, and include hydrohalides, e.g. hydrochlorides and hydrobromides, sulfates, phosphates, nitrates, sulfamates, acetates, citrates, lactates, tartrates, malonates, oxalates, salicylates, propionates, succinates, fumarates, maleates, methylene-bis-b-hydroxynaphthoates, gentisates, isethionates, di-p-toluoy I tartrates, methane-sulfonates, ethanesulfonates, benzenesulfonates, p-toluenesulfonates, cyciohexylsulfamates and quinates.<br>
As well as being useful in themselves as active compounds, salts of compounds of the invention are useful for the purposes of purification of the compounds, for example by exploitation of the solubility differences between the salts and the parent compounds, side products and/or starting materials by techniques well known to those skilled in the art.<br>

Pharmaceutical Compositions As explained above, compounds of the present invention exhibit useful pharmacological activity and accordingly are incorporated into pharmaceutical compositions and used in the treatment of patients suffering from certain medical disorders. The present invention thus provides, according to a further aspect, compounds of the invention and phannaceutical compositions containing compounds of the invention for use in therapy, wherein a pharmaceutical composition of the present invention comprising a compound of the present invention, and a pharmaceutical ly acceptable carrier thereof. As used herein, the term -pharmaceutically acceptable- preferably means approved by a regulatory agency of a government, in particular the Federal government or a state government, or listed in the U.S. Pharmacopeia or another generally recognized pharmacopeia for use in animals, and more<br><br>
particularly in humans. Suitable pharmaceutical carriers are described in -Remington-s Pharmaceutical Sciences- by E.W. Martin.<br>
A pharmaceutical composition according to the present invention can be prepared according to the customary methods, using one or more pharmaceutically acceptable adjuvants or excipients.    The adjuvants comprise, inter alia, diluents, sterile aqueous media and the various non-toxic organic solvents.    The compositions may be presented in the form of tablets, pills, granules, powders, aqueous solutions or suspensions, injectable solutions, elixirs or syrups, and can contain one or more agents chosen from the group comprising sweeteners, flavorings, colorings, or stabilizers in order to obtain pharmaceutically acceptable preparations. The choice of vehicle and the content of active substance in the vehicle are generally determined in accordance with the solubility and chemical properties of the active compound, the particular mode of administration and the provisions to be observed in pharmaceutical practice. For example, excipients such as lactose, sodium citrate, calcium carbonate, dicalcium phosphate and disintegrating agents such as starch, alginic acids and certain complex silicates combined with lubricants such as magnesium stearate, sodium lauryl sulfate and talc may be used for preparing tablets.    To prepare a capsule, it is advantageous to use lactose and high molecular weight polyethylene glycols. When aqueous suspensions are used they can contain emulsifying agents or agents which facilitate suspension. Diluents such as sucrose, ethanol, polyethylene glycol, propylene glycol, glycerol and chloroform or mixtures thereof may also be used. Such pharmaceutically acceptable carriers can also be sterile water and oils, including those of petroleum, animal, vegetable or synthetic origin, such as peanut oil, soybean oil, mineral oil, sesame oil and the like. Water is a preferred carrier when the pharmaceutical composition is administered intravenously. Saline solutions and aqueous dextrose and glycerol solutions can also be employed as liquid carriers, particularly for injectable solutions. Suitable pharmaceutical excipients include mannitol, human serum albumin (HSA), starch, glucose, lactose, sucrose, gelatin, malt, rice, flour, chalk, silica gel, magnesium carbonate, magnesium stearate, sodium stearate, glycerol monostearate, talc, sodium chloride, dried skim milk, glycerol, propylene, glycol, water, ethanol and the like. These compositions can take the form of solutions, suspensions, tablets, pills, capsules, powders, sustained-release formulations and the like.<br>
Naturally, a pharmaceutical composition of the present invention compositions will contain an effective diagnostic or therapeutic amount of the active compound together with a suitable amount of carrier so as to provide the form for proper administration to the patient. While intravenous injection is a very effective form of administration, other modes can be employed, such as by injection, or by oral, nasal or parenteral administration, which are discussed infra.<br><br>
Methods of Treatment Compounds within the scope of the present invention possess tryptase inhibition activity according to tests described in the literature and described in vitro procedures hereinafter, and which test results are believed to correlate to pharmacological activity in humans and other mammals. Thus, in a further embodiment, the present invention provides compounds of the invention and compositions containing compounds of the invention for use in the treatment of a patient suffering from, or subject to, conditions that can be ameliorated by the administration of an inhibitor of tryptase. For example, compounds of the present invention are useful in the treatment of inflammatory diseases, for example joint inflammation, including arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis and other arthritic conditions such as rheumatoid spondylitis, gouty arthritis, traumatic arthritis, rubella arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, osteoarthritis and other chronic inflammatory joint diseases, or diseases of joint cartilage destruction, ocular conjunctivitis, vernal conjunctivitis, inflammatory bowel disease, asthma, allergic rhinitis, interstitial lung diseases, fibrosis, sceleroderma, pulmonary fibrosis, liver cirrhosis, myocardial fibrosis, neurofibromas, hypertrophic scars, various dermatological conditions, for example, atopic dermatitis and psoriasis, myocardial infarction, stroke, angina and other consequences of atherosclerotic plaque rupture, as well as periodontal disease, diabetic retinopathy, tumor growth, anaphylaxis, multiple sclerosis, peptic ulcers, and syncytial viral infections.<br>
A special embodiment of the therapeutic methods of the present invention is the treating of asthma.<br>
Another special embodiment of the therapeutic methods of the present invention is the treating of joint inflammation.<br>
Another special embodiment of the therapeutic methods of the present invention is the treating of inflammatory bowel disease.<br>
According to a further feature of the invention there is provided a method for the treatment of a human or animal patient suffering from, or subject to, conditions which can be ameliorated by the administration of an inhibitor of tryptase, for example conditions as hereinbefore described, which comprises the administration to the patient of an effective amount of compound of the invention or a composition containing a compound of the invention. -Effective amount- is meant to describe an amount of compound of the present invention effective in inhibiting tryptase and thus producing the desired therapeutic effect.<br>
Combination Therapy As explained above, other pharmaceutically active agents can be employed in combination with the compounds of the invention depending upon the disease being treated. For example, in the treatment<br><br>
of asthma, beta-adrenergic agonists such as albuterol, terbutaline, formoterol, fenoterol or prenaline can be included, as can anticholinergics such as ipratropium bromide, anti-inflammatory corticosteroids such as beclomethasone dipropionate, triamcinolone acetonide, flunisolide or dexamethasone, and anti-inflammatory agents such as sodium cromoglycate and nedocromil sodium. Thus, the present invention extends to a pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound of the present invention and a second compound selected from the group consisting of a beta andrenergic agonist, an anticholinergic, an anti-inflammatory corticosteroid, and an anti-inflammatory agent; and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier thereof. Particular pharmaceutical carriers having applications in this pharmaceutical composition are described herein.<br>
Furthermore, the present invention extends to a method for treating a patient suffering from asthma, comprising administering the patient a compound of the present invention, and a second compound selected from the group consisting of a beta andrenergic agonist, an anticholinergic, an anti¬inflammatory corticosteroid, and an anti-inflammatory agent. In such a combination method, a compound of the present invention can be administered prior to the administration of the second compound, a compound of the present invention can be administered after administration of the second compound, or a compound of the present invention and the second compound can be administered concurrently.<br>
Modes of Delivery According to the invention, a compound of the present invention, or a pharmaceutical composition of the present invention, may be introduced parenterally, transmucosally, e.g., orally, nasally, pulmonarily, or rectally, or transdermally to a patient.<br>
Oral Delivery<br>
Contemplated for use herein are oral solid dosage forms, which are described generally in Remington-s Pharmaceutical Sciences, 18th Ed. 1990 (Mack Publishing Co. Easton PA 18042) at Chapter 89, which is herein incorporated by reference. Solid dosage forms include tablets, capsules, pills, troches or lozenges, cachets or pellets. Also, liposomal or proteinoid encapsulation may be used to formulate the present compositions (as, for example, proteinoid microspheres reported in U.S. Patent No. 4,925,673). Liposomal encapsulation may be used and the liposomes may be derivatized with various polymers (e.g., U.S. Patent No. 5,013,556). A description of possible solid dosage forms for a therapeutic is given by Marshall, K. In: Modern Pharmaceutics Edited by G.S. Banker and C.T. Rhodes Chapter 10, 1979, herein incorporated by reference. In general, the formulation will include a compound of the present invention, and inert ingredients which allow for protection against the stomach environment, and release of the biologically active material, i.e., a compound of the present invention, in the intestine.<br><br>
Also specifically contemplated are oral dosage forms of a compound of the present invention. Such a compound may be chemically modified so that oral delivery is more efficacious. Generally, the chemical modification contemplated is the attachment of at least one moiety to the component molecule itself, where said moiety permits (a) inhibition of proteolysis; and (b) uptake into the blood stream from the stomach or intestine. Also desired is the increase in overall stability of the compound of the present invention, and increase in circulation time in the body. Examples of such moieties include: polyethylene glycol, copolymers of ethylene glycol and propylene glycol, carboxymethyl cellulose, dextran, polyvinyl alcohol, polyvinyl pyrrolidone and polyproline. Abuchowski and Davis, 1981, -Soluble Polymer-Enzyme Adducts- In: Enzymes as Drugs, Hocenberg and Roberts, eds,, Wiley-lnterscience, New York, NY, pp, 367-383; Newmark, et al„ 1982, J. Appl. Biochem. 4:185-189. Other polymers that could be used are poly-l,3-dioxolane and poly-l,3,6-tioxocane. Preferred for pharmaceutical usage, as indicated above, are polyethylene glycol moieties.<br>
For a compound of the present invention, the location of release may be the stomach, the small intestine (the duodenum, the jejunum, or the ileum), or the large intestine. One skilled in the art has available formulations that will not dissolve in the stomach, yet will release the material in the duodenum or elsewhere in the intestine. Preferably, the release will avoid the deleterious effects of the stomach environment, either by protection of the compound of the present invention, or by release of the compound beyond the stomach environment, such as in the intestine.<br>
To ensure full gastric resistance a coating impermeable to at least pH 5.0 is essential. Examples of the more common inert ingredients that are used as enteric coatings are cellulose acetate trimellitate (CAT), hydroxypropylmethylcellulose phthalate (HPMCP), HPMCP 50, HPMCP 55, polyvinyl acetate phthalate (PVAP), Eudragit L30D, Aquateric, cellulose acetate phthalate (CAP), Eudragit L, Eudragit S, and shellac. These coatings may be used as mixed films.<br>
A coating or mixture of coatings can also be used on tablets, which are not intended for protection against the stomach. This can include sugar coatings, or coatings that make the tablet easier to swallow. Capsules may consist of a hard shell (such as gelatin) for delivery of dry therapeutic i.e. powder; for liquid forms, a soft gelatin shell may be used. The shell material of cachets could be thick starch or other edible paper. For pills, lozenges, molded tablets or tablet triturates, moist massing techniques can be used.<br>
The therapeutic can be included in the formulation as fine multi-particulates in the form of granules or pellets of particle size about 1 mm. The formulation of the material for capsule administration could<br><br>
also be as a powder, lightly compressed plugs or even as tablets. The therapeutic could be prepared by compression.<br>
Colorants and flavoring agents may all be included. For example, the compound of the present invention may be formulated (such as by liposome or microsphere encapsulation) and then further contained within an edible product, such as a refrigerated beverage containing colorants and flavoring agents.<br>
One may dilute or increase the volume of the therapeutic with an inert material. These diluents could include carbohydrates, especially mannitol, a-lactose, anhydrous lactose, cellulose, sucrose, modified dextrans and starch. Certain inorganic salts may be also be used as fillers including calcium triphosphate, magnesium carbonate and sodium chloride. Some commercially available diluents are Fast-Flo, Emdex, STA-Rx 1500, Emcompress and Avicell.<br>
Disintegrants may be included in the formulation of the therapeutic into a solid dosage form. Materials used as disintegrates include, but are not limited to starch, including the commercial disintegrant based on starch, Explotab. Sodium starch glycolate, Amberlite, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, ultramylopectin, sodium alginate, gelatin, orange peel, acid carboxymethyl cellulose, natural sponge and bentonite may all be used. Another form of the disintegrants are the insoluble cationic exchange resins. Powdered gums may be used as disintegrants and as binders and these can include powdered gums such as agar, Karaya or tragacanth. Alginic acid and its sodium salt are also useful as disintegrants.<br>
Binders may be used to hold the therapeutic agent together to form a hard tablet and include materials from natural products such as acacia, tragacanth, starch and gelatin. Others include methyl cellulose (MC), ethyl cellulose (EC) and carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC). Polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP) and hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose (HPMC) could both be used in alcoholic solutions to granulate the therapeutic.<br>
An anti-frictional agent may be included in the formulation of the therapeutic to prevent sticking during the formulation process. Lubricants may be used as a layer between the therapeutic and the die wall, and these can include but are not limited to; stearic acid including its magnesium and calcium salts, polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE)- liquid paraffin, vegetable oils and waxes. Soluble lubricants may also be used such as sodium lauryl sulfate, magnesium lauryl sulfate, polyethylene glycol of various molecular weights, Carbowax 4000 and 6000.<br><br>
Glidants that might improve the flow properties of the drug during formulation and to aid rearrangement during compression might be added. The glidants may include starch, talc, pyrogenic silica and hydrated silicoaluminate.<br>
To aid dissolution of the therapeutic into the aqueous environment a surfactant might be added as a wetting agent. Surfactants may include anionic detergents such as sodium iauryl sulfate, dioctyl sodium sulfosuccinate and dioctyl sodium sulfonate. Cationic detergents might be used and could include benzalkonium chloride or benzethomium chloride. The list of potential non-ionic detergents that could be included in the formulation as surfactants are lauromacrogol 400, polyoxyl 40 stearate, polyoxyethylene hydrogenated castor oil 10, 50 and 60, glycerol monostearate, polysorbate 40, 60, 65 and 80, sucrose fatty acid ester, methyl cellulose and carboxymethyl cellulose. These surfactants could be present in the formulation of a compound of the present invention either alone or as a mixture in different ratios.<br>
Additives which potentially enhance uptake of a compound of the present invention are, for instance, the fatty acids oleic acid, linoleic acid and linolenic acid.<br>
Controlled release oral formulation may be desirable. The drug could be incorporated into an inert matrix which permits release by either diffusion or leaching mechanisms, e.g., gums. Slowly degenerating matrices may also be incorporated into the formulation. Some enteric coatings also have a delayed release effect.<br>
Another form of a controlled release of this therapeutic is by a method based on the Oros therapeutic system (Alza Corp.), i.e. the drug is enclosed in a semipermeable membrane which allows water to enter and push drug out through a single small opening due to osmotic effects.<br>
Other coatings may be used for the formulation. These include a variety of sugars which could be applied in a coating pan. The therapeutic agent could also be given in a film coated tablet and the materials used in this instance are divided into 2 groups. The first are the nonenteric materials and include methyl cellulose, ethyl cellulose, hydroxyethyl cellulose, methylhydroxy-ethyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl-methyl cellulose, sodium carboxy-methyl cellulose, providone and the polyethylene glycols. The second group consists of the enteric materials that are commonly esters of phthalic acid.<br>
A mix of materials might be used to provide the optimum film coating. Film coating may be carried out in a pA11-coater or in a fluidized bed or by compression coating.<br><br>
Pulmonary Delivery<br>
Also contemplated herein is pulmonary delivery of a compound of the present invention, either alone, or in a pharmaceutical composition. The compound is delivered to the lungs of a mammal while inhaling and traverses across the lung epithelial lining to the blood stream. Other reports of this include Adjei et al., 1990, Pharmaceutical Research, 7:565-569; Adjei et al., 1990, International Journal of Pharmaceutics, 63:135-144 (leuprolide acetate); Braquet et al., 1989, Journal of Cardiovascular Pharmacology, I3(suppl. 5):143-146 (endothelin-1); Hubbard et al., 1989, Annals of Internal Medicine, Vol. HI, pp. 206-212 (al- antitrypsin); Smith et al., 1989, J. Clin, Invest. 84:1145-1146 (a-1-proteinase); Oswein et al., 1990, -Aerosolization of Proteins-, Proceedings of Symposium on Respiratory Drug Delivery II, Keystone, Colorado, March, (recombinant human growth hormone); Debs et a!., 1988, J. Immunol. 140:3482-3488 (interferon-y and tumor necrosis factor alpha) and Platz et al., U.S. Patent No. 5,284,656 (granulocyte colony stimulating factor). A method and composition for pulmonary delivery of drugs for systemic effect is described in U.S. Patent No. 5,451,569, issued September 19, 1995 to Wong et al.<br>
Contemplated for use in the practice of this invention are a wide range of mechanical devices designed for pulmonary delivery of therapeutic products, including but not limited to nebulizers, metered dose inhalers, and powder inhalers, all of which are familiar to those skilled in the art.<br>
Some specific examples of commercially available devices suitable for the practice of this invention are the Ultravent nebulizer, manufactured by Mallinckrodt, Inc., St. Louis, Missouri; the Acorn II nebulizer, manufactured by Marquest Medical Products, Englewood, Colorado; the Ventolin metered dose inhaler, manufactured by Glaxo Inc., Research Triangle Park, North Carolina; and the Spinhaler powder inhaler, manufactured by Fisons Corp., Bedford, Massachusetts, to name only a few. Ail such devices require the use of formulations suitable for the dispensing a compound of the present invention. Typically, each formulation is specific to the type of device employed and may involve the use of an appropriate propellant material, in addition to the usual diluents, adjuvants and/or carriers useful in therapy. Also, the use of liposomes, microcapsules or microspheres, inclusion complexes, or other types of carriers is contemplated. Chemically modified compounds of the present invention may also be prepared in different formulations depending on the type of chemical modification or the type of device employed.<br>
Formulations suitable for use with a nebulizer, either jet or ultrasonic, will typically comprise a compound of the present invention dissolved in water at a concentration of about 0.1 to 25 mg of compound per mL of solution. The formulation may also include a buffer and a simple sugar (e.g,, for stabilization and regulation of osmotic pressure). The nebulizer formulation may also contain a<br><br>
surfactant, to reduce or prevent surface induced aggregation of the compound caused by atomization of the solution in forming the aerosol.<br>
Formulations for use with a metered-dose inhaler device will generally comprise a finely divided powder containing a compound of the invention suspended in a propellant with the aid of a surfactant. The propellant may be any conventional material employed for this purpose, such as a chlorofluorocarbon, a hydrochlorofluorocarbon, a hydrofluorocarbon, or a hydrocarbon, including trichlorofluoromethane, dichlorodifluoromethane, dichlorotetrafluoroethanol, and 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane, or combinations thereof. Suitable surfactants include sorbitan trioleate and soya lecithin. Oleic acid may also be useful as a surfactant<br>
Formulations for dispensing from a powder inhaler device will comprise a finely divided dry powder containing a compound of the invention, and may also include a bulking agent, such as lactose, sorbitol, sucrose, or mannitol in amounts which facilitate dispersal of the powder from the device, e,g., 50 to 90% by weight of the formulation. The compound of the present invention should most advantageously be prepared in particulate form with an average particle size of less than 10 mm (or microns), most preferably 0.5 to 5 mm, for most effective delivery to the distal lung.<br>
Nasal Delivery<br>
Nasal delivery of a compound of the present invention is also contemplated. Nasal delivery allows the passage of the compound to the blood stream directly after administering the therapeutic product to the nose, without the necessity for deposition of the product in the lung. Formulations for nasal delivery include those with dextran or cyclodextran.<br>
Transdermal Delivery<br>
Various and numerous methods are known in the art for transdermal administration of a drug, e.g., via a transdermal patch, have applications in the present invention. Transdermal patches are described in for example, U.S. Patent No. 5,407,713, issued April 18, 1995 to Rolando et al.; U.S. Patent No. 5,352,456, issued October 4, 1004 to Fallon et al.; U.S. Patent No, 5,332,213 issued August 9, 1994 to D-Angelo et al.; U.S. Patent No. 5,336,168, issued August 9, 1994 to Sibalis; U.S. Patent No. 5,290,561, issued March I, 1994 to Farhadieh et a!.; U.S. Patent No. 5,254,346, issued October 19, 1993 to Tucker et al.; U.S. Patent No. 5,164,189, issued November 17, 1992 to Berger et al.; U.S. Patent No. 5,163,899, issued November 17, 1992 to Sibalis; U.S. Patent Nos. 5,088,977 and 5,087,240, both issued February 18, 1992 to Sibalis; U.S. Patent No. 5,008,110, issued April 16, 199! to Benecke et al,; and U.S. Patent No. 4,921,475, issued May 1, 1990 to Sibalis, the disclosure of each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.<br><br>
It can be readlly appreciated that a transdermal route of administration may be enhanced by use of a dermal penetration enhancer, e.g., such as enhancers described in U.S. Patent No. 5,164,189 (supra), U.S. Patent No. 5,008,110 (supra), and U.S. Patent No. 4,879,119, issued November 7, 1989 to Aruga et al, the disclosure of each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.<br>
Topical Administration<br>
For topical administration, gels (water or alcohol based), creams or ointments containing compounds of the invention may be used. Compounds of the invention may also be incorporated in a gel or matrix base for application in a patch, which would allow a controlled release of compound through the transdermal barrier.<br>
Rectal Administration<br>
Solid compositions for rectal administration include suppositories formulated in accordance with<br>
known methods and containing at least one compound of the invention.<br>
The percentage of active ingredient in the compositions of the invention may be varied, it being necessary that it should constitute a proportion such that a suitable dosage shall be obtained. Obviously, several unit dosage forms may be administered at about the same time. The dose employed will be determined by the physician, and depends upon the desired therapeutic effect, the route of administration and the duration of the treatment, and the condition of the patient. In the adult, the doses are generally from about 0.001 to about 50, preferably about 0.001 to about 5, mg/kg body weight per day by inhalation, from about 0.01 to about 100, preferably 0.1 to 70, more especially 0.5 to 10, mg/kg body weight per day by oral administration, and from about 0.001 to about 10, preferably 0.01 to 1, mg/kg body weight per day by intravenous administration. In each particular case, the doses will be determined in accordance with the factors distinctive to the subject to be treated, such as age, weight, general state of health and other characteristics which can influence the efficacy of the medicinal product.<br>
Furthermore, compounds according to the invention may be administered as frequently as necessary in order to obtain the desired therapeutic effect. Some patients may respond rapidly to a higher or lower dose and may find much weaker maintenance doses adequate. For other patients, it may be necessary to have long-term treatments at the rate of 1 to 4 doses per day, in accordance with the physiological requirements of each particular patient.    Generally, the active product may be administered orally 1 to 4 times per day. Of course, for some patients, it will be necessary to prescribe not more than one or two doses per day.<br><br>
Naturally, a patient in whom administration of a compound of the present invention is an effective therapeutic regimen is preferably a human, but can be any animal. Thus, as can be readily appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art, the methods and pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention are particularly suited to administration to any animal, particularly a mammal, and including, but by no means limited to, domestic animals, such as feline or canine subjects, farm animals, such as but not limited to bovine, equine, caprine, ovine, and porcine subjects, wild animals (whether in the wild or in a zoological garden), research animals, such as mice, rats, rabbits, goats, sheep, pigs, dogs, cats, etc., avian species, such as chickens, turkeys, songbirds, etc., i.e,, for veterinary medical use.<br>

As an example of the interconversion process, compounds of formula (la) wherein R-, R-, R-, R- and<br>
n are as hereinbefore defined and R- contains an optionally substituted alkylene linkage, may be<br>
prepared by hydrogenation of the corresponding compounds of formula (la) in which R- contains the corresponding optionally substituted alkenylene or alkynylene linkage. The hydrogenation may be carried out using hydrogen (optionally under pressure) in the presence of a suitable metal catalyst, e.g. platinum or palladium optionally supported on an inert carrier such as carbon, preferably in a solvent such as methanol or ethanol, and at a temperature at about room temperature.<br>
As another example of the interconversion process, compounds of the invention containing a heterocyclic group wherein the heteroatom is a nitrogen atom may be oxidized to their corresponding N-oxides. The oxidation may conveniently be carried out by means of reaction with a mixture of hydrogen peroxide and an organic acid, e.g. acetic acid, preferably at or above room temperature, for example at a temperature of about 60-90°C. Alternatively, the oxidation may be carried out by reaction with a peracid, for example peracetic acid or m-chloroperoxybenzoic acid, in an inert solvent such as chloroform or dichloromethane, at a temperature from about room temperature to reflux, preferably at elevated temperature. The oxidation may alternatively be carried out by reaction with hydrogen peroxide in the presence of sodium tungstate at temperatures between room temperature and about 60°C.<br>
As another example of the interconversion process, compounds of formula (la) containing sulfone linkages may be prepared by the oxidation of corresponding compounds containing -S- or sulfoxide linkages. For example, the oxidation may conveniently be carried out by means of reaction with a<br><br>
peroxyacid, e.g. 3-chloroperbenzoic acid, preferably in an inert solvent, e.g. dichloromethane, preferably at or near room temperature.<br>

IN VITRO TEST PROCEDURE<br>
Since all the actions of tryptase, as described in the background section, are dependent on its catalytic<br>
activity, then compounds that inhibit its catalytic activity will potentially inhibit the actions of tryptase.<br>
Inhibition of this catalytic activity may be measured by the in vitro enzyme assay and the cellular<br>
assay.<br>
Tryptase inhibition activity is confirmed using either isolated human lung tryptase or recombinant human p tryptase expressed in yeast cells. Essentially equivalent results are obtained using isolated native enzyme or the expressed enzyme. The assay procedure employs a 96 well microplate (Costar 3590) using L-pyroglutamyl-L-prolyl-L-arginine-para-nitroanilide (S2366: Quadratech) as substrate (essentially as described by McEuen et. al Biochem Pharm, 1996, 52, pages 331-340). Assays are performed at room temperature using 0.5mM substrate (2 x Km) and the microplate is read on a<br>
microplate reader (Beckman Biomek Plate reader) at 405nm wavelength. The inhibition constant (Ki) for particular compounds of the present invention is set forth in Table 8. It was determined using the procedure set forth herein.<br>
Materials and Methods for Tryptase primary screen (Chromogenic assay)<br>
Assay buffer 50 mM Tris (pH 8.2), 100 mM NaCI, 0.05% Tween 20, 50 ug/ml heparin.<br>
Substrate S2366 (Stock solutions of 2.5 mM).<br>
Enzyme Purified recombinant beta Tryptase Stocks of 310 ug/ml. Protocol (Single point determination)<br>
•	Add 60 ul of diluted substrate (final concentration of 500 uM in assay buffer) to each well<br>
•	Add compound in duplicates , final concentration of 20 uM, volume 20 ul<br>
•	Add enzyme at a final concentration of 50 ng/ml in a volume of 20 ul<br>
•	Total volume for each well is 100 ul<br>
•	Agitate briefly to mix and incubate at room temp in the dark for 30 minutes<br>
•	Read absorbencies at 405 nM<br>
Each plate has the following controls -<br>
Totals :	60 ul of substrate, 20 ul of buffer (with 0.2% final concentration of DMSO), 20 ul of<br>
enzyme Non-specific:    60 ul of substrate, 40 ul of buffer (with 0.2% DMSO)<br><br>
Totals:	60 ul of substrate, 20 ul of buffer (No DMSO), 20 ul of enzyme<br>
Non-specific:    60 ul of substrate, 40 ul of buffer (No DMSO)<br>
Protocol (IC50 and Ki determination)<br>
The protocol is essentially the same as above except that the compound is added in duplicates at the following final concentrations: 0.01, 0.03, 0.1, 0.3, 1, 3, 10 uM (All dilutions carried out manually). For every assay, whether single point or 1C50 determination, a standard compound is used to derive IC50 for comparison. From the IC 50 value, the Ki can be calculated using the following formula: Ki = IC50/(l + [Substrate]/Km).<br><br><br><br>
This data clearly shows that compounds of the present invention exhibit tryptase inhibition activity. Consequently, compounds of the present invention readily have applications in pharmaceutical compositions for treating a wide variety of tryptase related conditions, and naturally, in methods for treating such conditions in patients.<br>
