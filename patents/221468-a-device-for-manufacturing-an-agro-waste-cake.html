				<td>The subject invention relates to a device for manufacturing an agrowaste cake having a plurality of air passages.<br>
The embodiment of the invention resides in the circumferentially placed uniformly distributed air passages for uniform burning and maximum heat generation.<br>
The object of the invention is to produce cakes with uniform density to get uniform burning and less fuel consumption.<br>
Agricultural wastes are difficult to be handled because of their bulky and scattered nature, low thermal efficiency and copious Iiberation of smoke.<br>
The loose agro-residues made after carbonization into manageable pieces or<br><br>
cakes in cylindrical shape having plurality of holes gives high thermal value smokeless energy source like liquid petroleum gas. The preparation of these cakes manually with the help of a mould is known conventionally, which is very inefficient and time consuming process. The mould for the preparation of such cakes as known conventionally is a three piece body consisting of bottom plate with protruding rods, a middle cylinder to fit the bottom plate and a perforated plate to slide down along the rods into the cylinder. At the time of manufacturing such cakes, all the three parts of the mould are first assembled and the raw material is poured in it and once the cake is prepared, all the three parts of the mould are separated one by one to get the cake s@ prepared.<br>
To overcome the disadvantages like the lack of uniformity, more time consuming, lesser production rate, more fuel consumption and the like inherent in the preparation of such cake manually, the device of the subject invention have been developed.<br><br>
The subject agrowaste cake manufacturing device has been found to give excellent quality cakes out of agrowaste besides producing cakes efficiently with respect to increase in the number of such cakes so prepared and consuming less time for the preparation of such cakes. Moreover, the cake so prepared have been found to be easy in transportation and storage.<br>
For the production of such agrowaste cakes in the device of subject invention, the biomass is first heated at a temperature of between 248-260Â°C in the controlled conditions to produce char. In the char so produced is added clay in the ratio of 15-35% by weight, to form a mixture. The said mixture of char and clay is then moistened to form a semi-solid paste of uniform consistency. The said semi-solid paste is then transferred into the mould of subject device to prepare cake. These cakes are then dried. The clay used in the subject mixture acts as binder as well as energy extender.<br>
The agrowaste cake manufacturing device of the present invention is designed to manufacture compacted cakes with plurality of holes , preferably 19 holes, using the carbonized agricultural wastes mixed with moistened clay acting as binding agent. The subject device comprises a compactor assembly, a cake air passage die, a cake die and a cake ejector.<br>
The compactor assembly consist of a vertical movement rack and pinion or gear arrangement, where the pinion or gear arrangement is firmly fixed to a lever for imparting it a rotary motion. The lower end of the rack is fitted with the cake air passage die. The cake air passage die is made up of top plate and spring loaded compacting plate. The diameter of the top plate is 110-130 mm and the thickness of the top plate is 8-11 mm. The top plate is fitted with 19 pins having tapering ends of length 80-110 mm and diameter of 9-13mm. The said pins are arranged in a circle where the said pins are spaced apart from each other by 22-26mm. The spring loaded compacting plate is a circular plate having a diameter of 110-130mm and thickness of 3-5mm. The<br><br>
spring loaded compacting plate is provided with holes in conformity to the diameter of pins of the top plate to allow the pins of the top plate to pass through the spring loaded compacting plate. The plate is fitted with three support rods of the diameter 7-10 mm and the length of 140-155mm located on the periphery of the said plate. These support rods pass through the top plate and the springs of the plate force back to its position after the top plate is raised from cake die.<br>
The compacting plate acts as the cover on cake die to arrest the semisolid agrowaste mixture from spilling over. The compacting plate compresses the semi-solid agrowaste mixture loaded in the cake die , when the top plate moves down to form air passages in the cake. The compacting plate also acts as a retainer plate to ensure smooth withdrawal of pins from the cake after compacting the same.<br>
The cake die is a cylinder having the diameter of 130-140mm and length of 80-110 mm. The cake die is fitted on a base plate, wherein the base plate is provided with a hole of 117-120 mm concentric with the cake die to provide a collar to the cake die. The diameter of the base plate is 135-150mm. The base plate is mounted on a stand, The said collar provides the base support for the cake plate.<br>
The another important part of the said machine is the ejector assembly , which consists of a cake plate and a lever. The cake plate fits on a cylindrical support which moves up and down in a concentric column guide fixed firmly to the frame of the said machine. The vertical movement to the cake plate is provided by the lever which pushes up the bottom of the cylindrical support. The design of the cake plate conforms to the design of the compacting plate.<br>
