COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See-Section 10]<br>
"NOVEL COMPOUNDS"    ;<br>
AstraZeneca AB, a Swedish company of S-151 85 Sodertalje, Sweden<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed :-<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
The present invention relates to compound and composition of the said compound<br>
The present invention relates to novel compounds, processes for their preparation, pharmaceutical compositions containing them and their use in therapy.<br>
Chemokines play an important role in immune and inflammatory responses in various diseases and disorders, including asthma and allergic diseases, as well as autoimmune pathologies such as rheumatoid arthritis and atherosclerosis. These small secreted molecules are a growing superfamily of 8-14 kDa proteins characterised by a conserved four cysteine motif. The chemokine superfamily can be divided into two main groups exhibiting characteristic structural motifs, the Cys-X-Cys (C-X-C) and Cys-Cys (C-C) families. These are distinguished on the basis of a single amino acid insertion between the NH-proximal pair of cysteine residues and sequence similarity.<br>
The C-X-C chemokines include several potent chemoattractants and activators of neutrophils such as interleukin-8 (TL-8) and neutrophil-activating peptide 2 (NAP-2).<br>
The C-C chemokines include potent chemoattractants of monocytes and lymphocytes but not neutrophils such as human monocyte chemotactic proteins 1-3 (MCP-1, MCP-2 and MCP-3), RANTES (Regulated on Activation, Normal T Expressed and Secreted), eotaxin and the macrophage inflammatory proteins la and 1/3 (MTP-la and MTP-113).  .<br>
Studies have demonstrated that the actions of the chemokines are mediated by subfamilies of G protein-coupled receptors, among which are the receptors designated CCR1, CCR2, CCR2A, CCR2B, CCR3, CCR4, CCR5, CCR6, CCR7, CCR8, CCR9, CCR10, CXCR1, CXCR2, CXCR3 and CXCR4. These receptors represent good targets for drug development since agents which modulate these receptors would be useful in the treatment of disorders and diseases such as those mentioned above.<br><br><br>

THF (10 ml) was added followed by diethyl azodicarboxylate (1.60 g, 9.18 mmol, 1.45 ml). After 15 minutes the reaction mixture was allowed to warm to room temperature and stirred overnight. The solvent was removed in vacuo, the residue stirred with ether/n-heptane (1 : 2, 50 ml) mixture. The solid triphenyl phosphine oxide was filtered off, the solution washed with aq. NaOH (1M, 3 x 75 ml). Evaporation of the solvent and flash chromatography on silica gel with ethyl acetate/n-heptane (ethyl acetate from 5 to 25 %) afforded the BOC-protected subtitle compound, which was dissolved in dichloromethane (20ml). Trifluoroacetic acid (10 ml) was added, and the reaction mixture was stirred overnight at room temperature. The solution was concentrated in vacuo and the product was purified by flash chromatography on silica gel (MeOH/CHCl3/NH3,100 : 100 : 1) to afford colourless oil (0.23 g, 12%).<br>

Introduction<br>
The assay measured the chemotactic response ehcited by MlP-la chempkine in the human monocytic cell line THP-1. The compounds of the Examples were evaluated by their ability to depress the chemotactic response to a standard concentration of Mff-la chemokine.<br>
Methods<br>
Culture of THP-1 cells<br>
Cells were thawed rapidly at 37°C from frozen aliquots and resuspended in a 25 cm flask containing 5 ml of RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with Glutamax and 10% heat inactivated fetal calf serum without antibiotics (RPM+10%HIFCS). At day 3 the medium is discarded and replaced with fresh medium.<br>
THP-1 cells are routinely cultured in RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 10% heat inactivated fetal calf serum and glutamax but without antibiotics. Optimal growth of the cells requires that they are passaged every 3 days and that the minimum subculture density is 4x10+5 cells/ml.<br>
Chemotaxis assay<br>
Cells were removed from the flask and washed by centrifugation in RPM+10%HIFCS+gmtamax. The cells were then resuspended at 2x10+7 cells/ml in fresh medium (RPMI+10%HIFCS+glutamax) to which was added calcein-AM (5 ul of stock solution to 1 ml to give a final concentration of 5x10" M). After gentle mixing the<br>
u n<br><br>
cells were incubated at 37°C in a C02 incubator for 30'minutes. The cells were then diluted to 50 ml with medium and washed twice by centrifugation at 400xg. Labelled cells were then resuspended at a cell concentration of 1x10+7 cells/ml and incubated with an equal volume of MTP-la antagonist (10"10M to 10"6M final concentration) for 30 minutes' at 37°C in a humidified C02 incubator.<br>
Chemotaxis was performed using Neuroprobe 96-well chemotaxis plates employing 8 um filters (cat no. 101-8). Thirty microlitres of chemoattractant supplemented with various concentrations of antagonists or vehicle were added to the lower wells of the plate in triplicate. The filter was then carefully positioned on top and then 25uJ of cells preincubated with the corresponding concentration of antagonist or vehicle were added to the surface of the filter. The plate was then incubated for 2 hours at 37°C in a humidified CO2 incubator. The cells remaining on the surface were then removed by adsorption and the whole plate was centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 10 minutes. The filter was then removed and the cells that had migrated to the lower wells were quantified by the fluorescence of cell associated calcein-AM. Cell migration was then expressed in fluorescence units after subtraction of the reagent blank and values were standardized to % migration by comparing the fluorescence values with that of a known number of labelled cells. The effect of antagonists was calculated as % inhibition when the number of migrated cells were compared with vehicle.<br><br>
