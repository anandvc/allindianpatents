OVERVOLTAGE PROTECTION  DEVICE<br>
The invention relates to an overvoltage protection device for protection of low voltage<br>
electrical installations, having a device base part with terminals for phase conductors (LI, L2,<br>
L3) and ground or neutral conductors (PE, N) and of at least one overvoltage protection<br>
element, with an arreste which is located in a housing especially a lightning and/or surge<br>
arrester, the base part of the device having at least one telecommunications contact which has<br>
a switch for remote indication of the slate of at least one overvoltage protection element, and<br>
preferably, the base part of the device having plug-in Contacts which are connected to the<br>
terminals and which are made especially as sockets, and the overvoltage protection element<br>
having corresponding connector contacts made especially as plug pins so that the overvoltage<br>
protection element can be plugged onto the base part of the device<br>
Electrical, but especially electronic measurement, control and switching circuits, mainly also<br>
telecommunications equipment and systems, are sensitive to transient overvoltages, as can<br>
occur especially by atmosphere discharges, but also by switching operations or. short circuits<br>
in power supply grids This sensitivity has increased lo the extent electronic components,<br>
especially transistors and thynstors, are being used, in particular, increasingly used integrated<br>
circuits are highly endangered by transient overvoltages<br>
Electrical circuits normal y work without problems using the voltage specified for them, the<br>
rated voltage (generally the grid voltage) This does not apply when overvoltages occur<br>
Overvoltages are considered to be all voltages which are above the upper tolerance limit of the<br>
rated voltage They also include mainly transtent overvoltages which can occur due to<br>
atmospheric discharges, But also due to switching operations ot short circuits in power<br>
supply grids, and can be galvanically, inductively or capacitively coupled into electronic<br>
Circuits In order to protect electrical or electronic circuit:, especially electronic measurment<br>
control and switching circuit, mainly also telecommunication equipment and   system.<br><br>
	- 2 -	DE 20 2O04 006 227 5<br>
wherever they are used, against transient overvoltages, overvoltage protection elements have<br>
been developed and have been known for more than 20 years<br>
The required measures for protection of the power supply of installations and devices are<br>
divided into different stages, depending on the choice of arrester and the expected ambient<br>
influences. The overvoltage protection devices for the individual stages, are distinguished<br>
essentially by the level of arresting capacity and the level of protection<br>
The first protection stage (type 1) is generally formed by a lightning arrester which is<br>
installed as an extremel high power protection device in the central power supply of a<br>
building An important component of such a lightning arrester is a spark gap with at least two<br>
electrodes, an are being XXX between the two electrodes when the spark gap is ignited<br>
The second protection ,stage (type 2) generally forms a varistor-based xxx arrester This<br>
protection stage again limits the remaining residual voltage over the lightning arrester.<br>
Depending on the xxx potential of the installation which is to be protected or the building<br>
which is to be protected, it can be sufficient in the individual case if the second protection<br>
stage, i e., the surge arrester, is used to start<br>
In addition, there are triggered-type lightning arresters which are based on the AEC principle<br>
(active energy control) and which constitute a combination of a lightning arrester and surge<br>
arrester In this arrester combination, lightning and surge arresters can be connected directly<br>
in parallel This is especially advantageous when the lightning and surge arresters cannot be<br>
installed specially separate from one another<br>
Within the framework of this invention, the above described versions can be called arresters<br>
without the intention to limit the invention to one special arrester type Such an arrester then<br>
forms the significant component of an overvoltage protection element, the overvoltage<br>
protection element having at least one housing which holds the arrester<br><br>
	- 3 -	DE 20 2004 006 227 5<br>
Known overvoltage protection devices for connection to electrical lines have a device base<br>
part which can be mourted, for example, on a supporting xxx For installation of such an<br>
overvoltage protection device which is designed to protect for example the phase-carrying<br>
conductors LI, L2, L3 and the neutral conducts N, and optionally also the ground conductor<br>
PE, m the known overvoltage protection devices, on the base part of the device, there are<br>
corresponding terminals for the phase conductors and the ground and neutral conductor. In<br>
the overvoltage protect on device underlying the invention (Phoenix Contact brochure<br>
Overvoltage protection TRABTECH 2002, pages 24 xxx 25). the base part of the device has<br>
an asymmetrical connection pattern. In the known overvoltage protection device in which the<br>
base part of the device is made roughly U-shaped, on one leg there are the terminals for the<br>
phase conductors and the neutral conductor and on the other terminal leg there is the terminal<br>
for the ground conductor<br>
For simple mechanica and electrical contact-making of the base part of the device with the<br>
respective overvoltage protection element, in the known overvoltage protection device, the<br>
overvoltage protector elements are made as "protective plugs", i.e, the base part of the<br>
device has sockets connected to the terminals and the overvoltage protection element has the<br>
corresponding plug pins, so that the overvoltage protection element can be plugged onto the<br>
base part of the device, In addition, the known overvoltage protection device has another<br>
changeover contact as a sensing element for remote indication of the state of at least one<br>
overvoltage protection element, for this purpose, in the base part of the device, there being a<br>
switch, and on the overvoltage protection element, there being an actuating element<br>
In the known overvoltage protection device, installation and mounting are very simple and<br>
time-saving due to the plug-in capacity of the overvoltage protection elements The<br>
telecommunications contact enables easy remote monitoring However, moreover, it ean also<br>
be desirable to be able to read the state or status of the overvoltage protection element<br>
directly on site But it is a problem here that, especially in overvoltage protection elements<br>
which are made as "protective plugs," only relatively little space is available in the housing<br><br>
-	 4 -	DE 20 2004 006 227 5<br>
Theiefore, a primary object of this invention is to further improve the initially described<br>
overvoltage protection device with respect to the ease of its operation<br>
This object is, first of all, achieved essentially in the initially described overvoltage protection<br>
device m that the overvoltage protection element has an optical status display and that the<br>
optical status display and the switch of the telecommunications contact can be actuated via a<br>
common mechanical xxx system<br>
Because the overvoltage protection element or the individual overvoltage protection elements<br>
each has or have an optical status display, the state or the status of each overvoltage<br>
protection device is displayed directly on site. The simplifies both the installation of the<br>
individual overvoltage protection devices and also the maintenance and replacement of<br>
defective overvoltage protection devices since their state is directly displayed on the<br>
overvoltage protection device both via remote indication in a control center and also via the<br>
optical status display Thus, there is no longer any danger that an installer will replace the<br>
wrong overvoltage protection element Because the optical status display and the switch of<br>
the telecommunications contact can be actuated via a common mechanical actuating system,<br>
on the one hand, the amount of space required for the optical status display is minimized, and<br>
on the other, electrical power is not needed for setting the optical status display<br>
According to one preferred embodunent of the overvoltage protection device in accordance<br>
with the invention, the mechanical actuating system has a first spring-loaded actuating means<br>
for actuation of the switch and a second spring-loaded actuating means for actuation of the<br>
optical status display. Here, the first actuating means is located in the lower part of the device<br>
and the second actuating means is located in the overvoltage protection element, the fust<br>
actuating means being controlled by the state of the second actuating means That the<br>
mechanical actuating system is in two parts has the advantage that different overvoltage<br>
protection elements can be plugged onto the same base part of the device without adaptations<br>
being necessary on the actuating means of the base part of the device In this way, the specific<br>
configuration of the actuating means of the overvoltage protection element can be adapted<br><br>
	- 5 -	DE 20 2004 006 227 5<br>
optimally to the respective arrester type which is contained in the ovavoltage protection<br>
element<br>
The first actuating means which is located in the base part of the device, is preferably<br>
implemented by a mechanical lever system which can be switched between two positions, by<br>
which the switch of the telecommunications contact can be actuated The lever system can be<br>
formed especially by a rocker, an actuating plunger and at least one preferably two springs,<br>
the rocker being inovableout of a first position into a second position, by which the switch of<br>
the telecommunications contact is actuated.<br>
As was stated above the first actuating means is controlled by the state of the second<br>
actuating means Contra of the second actuating means takes place preferably according to<br>
the principle of a temperature switch, as is described, for example, in German Patent DE 42<br>
41 311 C2. For thus purpose, the second actuating meartt has at least one spring element and<br>
solder site, the solder connection which is made at the solder site between the arrester or a<br>
component connected to the arrester and a part of the xxx means then being separated if<br>
the temperature of the arrester exceeds a certain response value When there is a solder<br>
connection the actuating means is held in the first position against the spring force of the<br>
apring element, while the actuating means with the solder connection separated is moved by<br>
spring force into the second position. The actuating means xxx thus pre-xxx when the<br>
solder connectaon is not separated, so that when the solder connection is separated due to the<br>
temperature increase of he arrester, the actuating means is automatically moved into the<br>
second position by the spring force<br>
The actuation of the second spring-loaded actuating means with the optical status display and<br>
with the first actuating means can be advantageously implemented in that the second spring-<br>
loaded actuating means xxx is the optical status display on its top end and on its other- bottom<br>
end, it has a blocking element In the first position of the second actuating means, the<br>
actuating plunger of the first actuating means is held in the first position by the blocking<br>
dement against the force of the sprng, while the actuating element releases the actuating<br><br>
	- 6 -	DE 20 2004 006 2275<br>
plunger in the second position, so that it likewise travels into the second position by the force<br>
of the spring<br>
As has already been stated, there are various possibilities for how the second spring-loaded<br>
actuating means is specifically made, the specific embodiment especially being associated<br>
with which arrester type is provided in the overvoltage protection element According to a<br>
first embodiment the second actuating means is formed by a bent flexible circuit board, the<br>
solder connection which is made at the solder site being implemented between the arrester and<br>
an area of the flexible circuit board, The use of a bent flexible circuit board as a sprig-loaded<br>
actuating means is especially advantageously in spark gap-based arresters<br>
According to a second configuration, the second actuating means has a spring-loaded plastic<br>
element which is movably positioned in the housing of the overvoltage protection element and<br>
a fixed metallic retention element, an opening being formed in the plastic element through<br>
which one end of the retention element is connected to the solder site in the first position of<br>
the actuating means. When the solder connection is not separated, between one end of the<br>
metallic retention element and the arrester, the spring-loaded plastic element is then held in<br>
the first position against the spring force of the spring element, while when the solder<br>
connection is separated, he retention element releases the movably arranged plastic element<br>
so that the plastic element is moved into the second position due to the spring force of the<br>
spring element<br>
In another alternative embodiment of the second actuating means, there are, likewise, a spring-<br>
loaded plastic element which is movably positioned in the housing of the overvoltage<br>
protection element, and a metallic retention element The solder connection is likewise<br>
implemented between the arrester and the metallic xxx element When the solder<br>
connection is present, the spring-loaded plastic element xxx held in the first position against the<br>
spring force of the spring element, and when the solder connection is separated, the plastic<br>
element is moved into the second position due to the spring fore In this version, the<br>
metallic retention elemen is only attached by the solder connection, so that the retention<br><br>
	-7-	DE 21 2004 0062275<br>
element changes its position together with the plastic element when the solder connection is<br>
separated The metallic retention element is fixed to the spring-loaded plastic element, and<br>
this connection can be xxx both positive and non-xxx<br>
According to another embodiment of the overvoltage protection device of the invention which<br>
is independent of the execution of the second actuating means, the base part of  the device has<br>
at least one coding element and the overvoltage protection element has at least one<br>
corresponding opposing coding element, the coduig element or element and the opposing<br>
coding element or element being arranged in the same manners as the plug contacts of the base<br>
part of the device and the connector contacts of the overvoltage protection element as well as<br>
the contact element and the xxx contact element, each symmetrically to the transverse axis<br>
of the overvoltage protection device so that the base part of the device and the overvoltage<br>
protection element can be brought into contact with one another in two arrangements which<br>
are turned 80° relative to one another The execution of the coding element and the opposing<br>
coding element is especially advantageous when several overvoltage protection elements can<br>
be inserted at the same time into the base part of the device; thus, the overvoltage protection<br>
device in a multipin overvoltage protection device. The arrangement of the coding element and<br>
of the opposing coding element can then prevent an overvoltage protection element from<br>
being uncorrectly plugged into the wrong position on the base part of the device<br>
Because the base part of the device has a symmetrical connection pattern, the base part of the<br>
device can thus be mounted such that connection of the incoming power supply lines to the<br>
corresponding terminals is easily possible, and the overvoltage protect element can always<br>
be correctly mounted regardless of the alignment of the base part of the divice<br>
In particular there are a host of possibilities for xxx and developing the overvoltage<br>
protection device according to the invention Reference is made to the following detailed<br>
description of preferred embodiments of the invention in conjunction uith the accompanying<br>
drawings.<br><br>

and<br>
Figure 7     shows a perspective  of a multipin overvoltage protection  device with  an<br>
overvoltage  rotetion device as shown m Figure 6<br>
The figures show an overvoltage protection device 1, with a base part 3 which has a housing<br>
2 In the illustrated embodiments, the base part 3 of the cevice is essentially U-shaped, and it<br>
can be mounted with xxx bottom on a supporting rail 4. The base part 3 of the device in Figure<br>
1 on the upper U leg xxx wo terminals 5 for each of the phase conductors Ll, L2, L3 and two<br>
terminals 6 for the ground conductor PE In the bottom U leg of the base part 3 of the device,<br>
there are two terminals 7 for the neutral conductor N<br>
In the embodiment of the overvoltage protection device 1 of the invention which is shown in<br>
the figures, the terminals 5, 6, 7 are each made as screw terminals. However, in addition, the<br>
terminals 5,6,7 can be made equally well as tension spring terminals, direct or leg spring<br>
terminals or as insulation xxx connecting devices or quick-connect terminals<br>
The arrangement of the terminals 5 for the phase conductors Lt L2, L3 and the terminals 6<br>
for the ground conductor I'E on one U leg of the base part 3 of the device and the terminals 7<br>
for the neutral conductor xxx on the other U leg results in the base part 3 of the device having<br>
an asymmetrical connection pattern<br><br>
	-9-	DE 20 2004 006 227 5<br>
The overvoltage protect on device 1 includes in addition to the base part 3 of the device at<br>
least one overvoltage protection element 8 which has an arrester 10 which is located in the<br>
housing 9, especially a lightning arrester which has a spark gap, or a vanstor-based surge<br>
arrester. In Figure 1, the lower half of the housing 9 of the overvoltage protection element 8 is<br>
omitted, so that the arrester 10 which is located in the overvoltage protection element 8<br>
becomes visible<br>
The sensing element for defect reporting in the overvoltage protection device 1 on the base<br>
part 3 of the device 3 is a common switch 11 which can be actuated by the first spring-loaded<br>
actuating means which is explained in further detail below. The signal of the switch 11 can be<br>
relayed via an electrical line for example, a bus line, or by radio, to an monitoring station<br>
The overvoltags protection elements 8 are made as protective plugs so that they can be easily<br>
mounted by plugging them onto the base part 3 of the device To do this, in the base part 3 of<br>
the device, there are two plug contacts 12 which are made as sockets and on the bottom of the<br>
overvoltage protection element 8 there are two corresponding connector contacts 13 made as<br>
plug pins. The general plug-in capacity of the individual overvoltage protection elements 8 in<br>
addition to easy installation of the overvoltage protection elements 80 also, enables simple<br>
replacement of a defective overvoltage protection element 8 For this reason, the<br>
corresponding overvoltage protection element 8 can be easily detached from the base part 3 of<br>
the device without the need for direct intervention into the installation The rotation capacity<br>
of the base part 3 of the device relative to the overvoltage protection elements 8 is achieved in<br>
that the plug contacts 12 of the base part 3 of the device and the connector contacts 13 of the<br>
overvoltage protection element 8 are arranged symmetrically to the transverse axis Q of the<br>
overvoltage protection device 1<br>
To display the status or the state of the overvoltage protection element 8 and of the arrester<br>
10, the overvoltage protection element on its upper narrow side i.e. the one facing away<br>
from the base pan 3 of the device, has a status display 14 The status display 14 shown in<br>
Figures 4 to 6 is actuated together with the switch 11 of the telecommunications contact via a<br><br>
	-1 0 -	DE 20 2004 006 227 5<br>
common mechanical actuating system which comprises a first spring-loaded actuating means<br>
and a second spring actuating means<br>
A preferred structure of  first actuating means which is located in the housing 2 of the base<br>
part 3 of the device will be explained below using Figures 2 and 3 The first actuating means is<br>
formed by a lever system and includes a rocker 15, an actuating plunger 16 and two springs<br>
17, In the first position of the first actuating means shown m Figure 3a, the rocker 15 is<br>
deflected such that one end makes contact with the switch 11 Here, the actuating plunger 16<br>
is pressed down by the second actuating means as will be explained below, against the spring<br>
force of the spring 17 which is assigned to the actuating plunger 16. In the second position,<br>
which is shown in Figure 3b, the rocker 15 is in an essentially horizontal position in which<br>
the end of the rocker 15 no longer makes contact with the switch 11<br>
Figures 4a to 6b show three different overvoltage protection elements 8 which each have a<br>
different arrester type and a different second actuating means It is common to the three<br>
differently made xxx; means that they each have 3 spring element 18 a soldering point 19<br>
and a locking element 20<br>
In the embodiment show in Figures 4a and 4b, die second actuating means is formed by a<br>
bent flexible circuit board 2l, which is bent on one side around the arrester 10, has the status<br>
display 14 on its top end and the blocking element 20 on its bottom end The flexible circuit<br>
board 21 has an area 22 which, on the soldering point 19, forms the solder connection to the<br>
arrester 10 which is made as a spark gap As Figures 4a 4b show, the soldering point 19 need<br>
not be made directly on the arrester 10, so that the solder connection is not directly between<br>
the area 22 of the flexible circuit board 21 and the arrester 10, For operation of the second<br>
actuating means, it is simply necessary that, when the temperature of the arrester 10 uses<br>
above a given response value, the solder connection is separated In the illustrated<br>
embodiment, the soldering point 19 and the solder connection are made between the area 22<br>
and the ignition circuit of he arrester 10.<br><br>
	- 11 -	DE 20 2004 006 227.5<br>
In the first position of the second actuating means shown in Figure 4a, the solder connection<br>
is not separated, so that the flexible circuit board 21 is deflected against the spring force of the<br>
spring element 18 as a result of the solder connection at the soldering point 19, In the second<br>
position of the second actuating means, which is shown in Figure 4b. conversely, the solder<br>
connection is separated, so that the flexible circuit board 21 can be pulled into the second<br>
position by the spring force of the spring element 18,<br>
In the second embodiment of overvoltage protection element 8, which is shown in Figures 5a<br>
and 5b, in which a varistor is used as the arrester 10, the actuating means has a plastic element<br>
23 which is movably positioned in the housing 9 of the overvoltage protection element 8, and<br>
a fixed metallic retention element 24. The plastic element 23 is held in the first position of the<br>
actuating means by the solder connection which exists at the solder site 19, between the<br>
metallic retention element 24 and the varistor, against the spring force of the spring element<br>
18 which is made as a compression spring. For this reason, in the plastic element 23, there is<br>
an opening 25 through which one end of the retention element 24 is connected to the soldering<br>
point 19 in the first position of the actuating means. When the temperature of the varistor<br>
exceeds a given response value, the solder connection which is formed at the soldering point<br>
19  is separated, so that the plastic element 23 is pushed into the second position by the<br>
spring force of the spring element 18 (Figure 5b). In this second position, the metallic<br>
retention element 24 is thermally and electrically separated from the varistor by the plastic<br>
element 23.<br>
Common to the two embodiments shown in Figures 4 and 5 is the fact that the top end of the<br>
flexible circuit board 21 or of the plastic element 23 is made as an optical status display 14,<br>
for which two marks 26,27 in different colors are printed or cemented on the flexible circuit<br>
board 21 or the plastic element 23 next to one another. The first mark 26 is green and the<br>
second mark 27 is red. The first green mark 26 is visible through the respective viewing<br>
window 40 (Fig. 1) in the first position, the "non-defective" position, while the second red<br>
mark 27 is visible through viewing window 40 in the second position, the "defective"<br>
position.<br><br>
	-12-	DE 20 2004 006 227.5<br>
Moreover, as stated above, a blocking element 20 is formed on the lower end of the flexible<br>
circuit board 21 or of the plastic element 23. The blocking element 20 is made and arranged<br>
such that, in the first position of the actuating means, it closes the opening 28 made on the<br>
bottom of the overvoltage protection element 8, while in the second position of the actuating<br>
means, it clears the opening 28. Because the opening 28 matches the position of the actuating<br>
plunger 16 in the base fart 3 of the device when the overvoltage protection element 8 has<br>
been plugged in, thus, because the blocking element 28 in the first position of the second<br>
actuating means closes the opening 20, the actuating plunger 16 is pressed down against the<br>
spring force of the spring 17. Conversely, in the second position of the second actuating<br>
means, the opening 28 is no longer closed by the blocking element 20, so that the actuating<br>
plunger 16 can be moved up through the opening 28 due to the spring force of the spring 17.<br>
Depending on the position of the blocking element 20, and thus, on the position of the second<br>
actuating means, therefore the position of the actuating plunger and thus the first actuating<br>
means located in the base part 3 of the device are actuated.<br>
The overvoltage protection element 8 which is shown in Figures 6 and 7 differs, first of all,<br>
from the above described overvoltage protection element 8 in that, in the overvoltage<br>
protection element 8 shown here, there are three arresters 10 which are made as spark gaps in<br>
an insulating housing which is provided in addition in the housing 9. The overvoltage<br>
protection element 8 which is shown in Figure 6 thus constitutes a plug-in, cumulative spark<br>
gap. The cylindrical arresters 10 each have pin-shaped connecting contacts °29, 30 on their<br>
ends with which they are locked into the corresponding recesses in the housing 9. The<br>
individual arresters 10 make contact on their jacket surface with spring clips 31, the electrical<br>
connection between the individual arresters 10 being produced by essentially U-shaped<br>
electrical connecting pieces 32 which are plugged onto the connecting contacts 29, 30 and are<br>
connected to the spring clips 31.<br>
In the overvoltage protection element 8 which is shown in Figures 6 and 7. the second<br>
actuating means is implemented by a spring-loaded plastic element 33 which is located<br>
movably in the housing 9 and by a metallic retention element 34, the plastic element °33 being<br><br>
	-13-	DE 20 2004 006 227.5<br>
located between two arresters 10, essentially parallel to the lengthwise extension of the<br>
arresters 10. In the first position of the actuating means shown in Figure 6, the metallic<br>
retention element 34 is connected by a solder connection to two connecting pieces 32 of two<br>
arresters 10. For this reason, the retention element 34 is made U-shaped, the two U-legs each<br>
forming a soldering point 19 with a respective connecting piece 32. When the solder<br>
connection is present, the plastic element 33 is held in the first position shown in Figure 6<br>
against the spring force of a spring element 18 which is made as a compression spring. For<br>
this reason, the plastic element 33 has a projection which adjoins the U-back of the retention<br>
element 34. If the solder connection between the metallic retention element 34 and the two<br>
connecting pieces 32 is opened due to the temperature rise of the arresters 10, the plastic<br>
element 33 moves up due to the spring force of the compression spring 18, together with the<br>
retention element 34.<br>
The optical status display 14 in the embodiment shown in Figures 6 and 7 is formed by a<br>
rocker arm or pivoting element 35 which is pivotally supported in the housing 9 and which is<br>
connected to the plastic element 33 via a flexible crosspiece 37 which acts outside of the pivot<br>
pin 36 which forms the axis of rotation for element 35. By this type of connection of the<br>
plastic element 33 to the hemispherical pivoting element 35, a rotary or pivoting motion of<br>
the pivoting element results from the transnational motion of the plastic element 33, so that<br>
the pivoting element 35 is moved out of the first position into the second position.<br>
According to the embodiment shown in Figures 6 and 7, the pivoting element 35 also has two<br>
differently colored section 38, 39, and depending on the position of the second actuating<br>
means only one or the other colored section 38. 39 is detectable from the outside through the<br>
respective viewing window 40 (Fig. 7) which is located in the housing 9 of the overvoltage<br>
protection element 8. The first, green section 38 is visible in the first position, the "non-<br>
defective" position, through the viewing window 40. while the second, the red section 39 is<br>
visible in the second position, the "defective" position.<br><br>
	-14-	DE 20 2004 006 227.5<br>
To hold and support the pivoting element 35, on the insulating housing of the arresters 10,<br>
there is a hinged cover 41 in which a bearing eye 42 is made for the pivot pin 36 of rotation of<br>
the pivoting element 35. As has already been explained in conjunction with Figures 4 &amp; 5, the<br>
lower end of the plastic element 33 which faces the base part 3 of the device also has a<br>
blocking element 20 by which the opening 28 can be covered depending on the position of the<br>
plastic element 33. In conjunction with Figure 7, it is recognizable that the overvoltage<br>
protection element 8 within the housing 9 (which is shown only partially in Figures 1 and 7)<br>
has an insulating housing which holds or surrounds the arresters 10.<br>
As was stated at the beginning, the overvoltage protection device 1 in accordance with the<br>
invention is used preferably as a multipin overvoltage protection device, i.e., several<br>
overvoltage protection elements 8 are inserted next to one another into the base part 3 of the<br>
device. Depending on the number of lines of the low voltage network which is to be protected<br>
(3-conductor, 4-conductor or 5-conductor network) and depending on whether a lightning<br>
arrester is necessary, the corresponding number and type of overvoltage protection elements<br>
8 is inserted into the correspondingly dimensioned base part 3 of the device. In order to<br>
prevent the overvoltage protection element 8 from being plugged into the wrong position<br>
within the base part 3 of the device, there are coding elements 43 on the base part 3 of the<br>
device, and there are the corresponding opposing coding elements 44 on the bottom of the<br>
overvoltage protection element 8. To ensure a rearrangement capacity, the coding elements °43<br>
and the opposing coding elements 44 are each arranged symmetrically relative to the<br>
transverse axis Q (Figure 1) of the overvoltage protection device 1.<br><br>
