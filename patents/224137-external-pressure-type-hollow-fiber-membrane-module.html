DESCRIPTION<br>
EXTERNAL PRESSURE TYPE HOLLOW FIBER MEMBRANE MODULE<br>
	TECHNICAL FIETLD<br>
	[0001]<br>
			The present invention relates to an external<br>
	pressure type hollow fiber membrane module used in a<br>
5	filtering device for clarifying a large quantity of raw<br>
	water such as river water, lake water, underground<br>
	water, sea water, domestic wastewater and industrial<br>
	wastewater and eliminating bacteria included therein.<br>
	BACKGROUND ART<br>
10	[0002]<br>
			In general, a hollow fiber membrane module is<br>
	classified broadly into an internal pressure type and<br>
	an external pressure type. The external pressure type<br>
	of hollow fiber membrane module normally has a<br>
15	structure of bundling several hundreds to tens of<br>
	thousands of hollow fiber membranes with a length of<br>
	200 to 3,000 mm and an outside diameter of the membrane<br>
	of 0-1 to 5 mm, accommodating the bundle in a<br>
	cylindrical case, and adhesively fixing the ends of<br>
20	both sides to an inner wall of the case with a resin.<br>
	When adhesively fixing both ends, there are an one-end<br>
	collection type module and a both-ends collection type<br>
	module: the former is formed so as to have the end of<br><br>
2<br>
	the hollow fiber mambrane opened in one adhesively-<br>
	fixed part, have the hollow part of fiber membrane<br>
	sealed at the other adhesively-fixed part, supply<br>
	compressively raw water to a region sandwiched between<br>
5	the adhesively-fixed parts to permeate through the<br>
	hollow fiber membrane, and take the filtrate out from<br>
	the adhesively-fixed part in which the end of the<br>
	hollow fiber is opened; and the latter is formed so as<br>
	to have the ends of the hollow fiber membrane opened in<br>
10	both adhesively-fixed parts, and take the filtrate out<br>
	from both ends. Furthermore, there are a plurality of<br>
	through-holes in hollov fiber membrane bundles at the<br>
	adhesively-fixed part that becomes to be a lower side<br>
	when being used, and their ports are used as a port for<br>
15	supplying raw water to be filtrated, and as an air<br>
	supply port and a cleaning waste water outlet in a<br>
	physical cleaning process.<br>
	[0003]<br>
		When such an external pressure type hollow<br>
20	fiber membrane module 15 used for the purpose of<br>
	bacteria eliminating and clarification, it is normally<br>
	subjected to a cross flow filtration to prevent a<br>
	suspended solid from depositing on the surface of a<br>
	hollow fiber membrane, or to the periodic physical<br>
25	cleaning such as a back wash reverse filtration and an<br>
	air bubbling to recover a filter performance, thereby<br>
	enabling a stable filtration operation. In order to<br>
	operate the module in the above method, the module has<br><br>
3<br>
	an exhaust port provided at the side face of a case in<br>
	the vicinity of an adhesively-fixed part in an upper<br>
	port, and is vertically installed. When the module is<br>
	used for filtration, the raw water containing the<br>
5	suspended solid is supplied from a through-hole<br>
	provided in the adhesively-fixed part in the lover<br>
	part, and the concentrated water is discharged from the<br>
	exhaust port provided in the side face in the upper<br>
	part of the case. In addition, in a cleaning step by<br>
10	air bubbling, the module is cleaned by the steps of<br>
	supplying air from the through-hole in the lower part;<br>
	thereby forming an air/water mixture flow; making the<br>
	membrane oscillated by the air/water mixture flow;<br>
	thereby stripping off the suspended solid deposited on<br>
15	the surface of a membrane; then supplying raw water<br>
	together with air; and discharging it from the exhaust<br>
	post provided at the side face in the upper part of the<br>
	case.<br>
		The flow of a liquid discharged from the<br>
20	exhaust port in Such a cross flow filtration and an air<br>
	bubbling cleaning occasionally draws the hollow fiber<br>
	membrane into the exhaust port to damage it, and the<br>
	oscillation of the membrane occasionally makes stress<br>
	concentration in the vicinity of the inner surface of an<br>
25	adhesively-fixed part to rupture the hollow fiber<br>
	membrane.<br>
	[0004]<br>
		In order to efficiently discharge a deposit<br><br>
4<br>
	outside a module by exfoliating it from the surface of<br>
	a membrane by the physical cleaning as described above,<br>
	a space must be secured between hollow fibers, so that<br>
	the hallow fiber membrane cannot be accommodated in the<br>
5	module having approximately the closest packed state,<br>
	as in the case of an internal pressure type module.<br>
	For this reason, a membrane-occupying rate in a housing<br>
	is normally set at 0.3 to 0.6. The "membrane-occupying<br>
	rate in a housing" used herein means a ratio of a total<br>
10	of the cross-sectional areas based on the outside<br>
	diameter of the membrane with reference to the cross-<br>
	sectional area based on the inside diameter of the<br>
	housing in a filtration region of the membrane. When<br>
	the membrane is accommodated in a comparative low<br>
15	density, the distribution of the membrane in an<br>
	adhesively—fixed part of the membrane easily tends to<br>
	be ununiform, and the hollow fiber membrane in the<br>
	vicinity of the inner surface of the above adhesively-<br>
	fixed part develops a strong tendency to be ruptured.<br>
20	[0005]<br>
		As the means of preventing the above<br>
	damage/rupture of a membrane in the vicinity of the<br>
	adhesivsly-fixed part of the hollow fiber membrane, a<br>
	method has been known which installs a current cylinder<br>
25	in the vicinity of the inner surface of the adhesively-<br>
	fixed part and arranges a layer of a high polymer<br>
	material having rubber-like elasticity in the inner<br>
	side of the adhesively-fixed part (for instance, See<br><br>
5<br>
	Patent Document 1). A method is also proposed which<br>
	coats the surface of the hollow fiber membrane<br>
	extending in the inner side of the adhesively-fixed<br>
	part with the same adhesive as that for forming the<br>
5	inner surface of the fixed part (for instance, see<br>
	Patent Document 21.<br>
	[0006]<br>
		However, the method according to Patent<br>
	Document 1 has an excellent effect in preventing the<br>
10	damage/rupture of a membrane as described above, but<br>
	when forming an adhesively-fixed layer only with a high<br>
	polymer having rubber-like elasticity, this may cause<br>
	the problem that the adhesively-fixed part may be<br>
	ruptured because the pressure resistance of the part is<br>
15	inferior. In addition, in order to secure the pressure<br>
	resistance, it is required to adhesively fix the<br>
	membrane with a material having high strength and high<br>
	elasticity, and then to form a layer of a rubber-like<br>
	elastic body on the inner side thereof, so that the<br>
20	method has a disadvantage of needing a complicated<br>
	manufacturing process and a high cost.<br>
		On the other hand, the method according to<br>
	Patent Document 2 does not have a sufficient effect of<br>
	preventing the membrane from being ruptured, and causes<br>
25	the problem that the membrane is ruptured by air<br>
	bubbling in a long term operation.<br>

	long period without any rupture of a membrane in the<br>

	BEST MODE FOE CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
	[0012]<br>
25		The present invention will be specifically<br>
	described below with a particular emphasis on a<br>
	preferred embodiment thereof.<br><br>
13<br>
		In the external pressure type membrane module<br>
	according to the present invention, it is important<br>
	that a ratio PB/PA of membrane-occupying rate PA in<br>
	neighboring region (A) of a nozzle among a membrane<br>
5	chargeable region on at least an inner side of an<br>
	adhesively-fixed part with reference to a membrane-<br>
	occupying rate PB in a non-neighboring region (B) of<br>
	the nozzle among the membrane changeable region<br>
	satisfies the range of 0.50 or more but 0.95 or less.<br>
10	When PB/PA is in the range, the fluid containing a<br>
	deposit on a membrane easily flows outside a membrane<br>
	bundle from the non-neighboring region, the fluid in<br>
	the neighboring region does not flow intensively, and<br>
	thus the damage or the rupture in the membrane is<br>
15	hardly caused. When PB/PA is leas than 0.50, the<br>
	density of the membranes which exist in non-neighboring<br>
	region (B) of the nozzle is too few to relatively form<br>
	the extreme nondense state, and thus the fluid<br>
	intensively flows therethrough, thereby developing a<br>
20	tendency to damage/rupture the membrane in the region<br>
	(B). On the other hand, when the PB/PA ratio exceeds<br>
	0.95, the membrane module reduces the effect of<br>
	preferentially discharging a deposit on a membrane from<br>
	the non-neighborlag region. Furthermore, when the<br>
25	PB/PA ratio exceeds l.0, the density of the membranes<br>
	which exist in neighboring region (A) is too few to<br>
	relatively form the extreme nondense state, and thus<br>
	the flow rate there becomes to be remarkably high,<br><br>

	thereby developing a tendency to damage/rupture the<br>
	membrane in region (A). The PB/PA ratio is preferably<br>
	0.60 or moce aud 0.90 or: less, and further preferably<br>
	0.1 or more and 0.90 or less.<br>
5	[0013]<br>
		In addition, when dividing a non-neighboring<br>
	region into a first non-neighboring region (Bl) and a<br>
	second non-neighboring region (B2) and definding a<br>
	membrane-occupying rate in each region as PBl and PB2,<br>
10	the membrane-occupying rates preferably satisfy PA  <br>
	PBl  PB2, and it is particularly preferable that PA is<br>
	0.40 or more but 0.60 or less and PB3 is 0.20 or more<br>
	but less than 0.40. When the membrane-occupying rates<br>
	satisfy these conditions, the membrane module<br>
15	adequately discharges a deposit on a membrane surface<br>
	from a membrane bundle, and can prevent the membrane<br>
	from being damaged or ruptured by a fluid flow.<br>
	[0014]<br>
		In the next place, the present invention will<br>
20	be described in detail with reference to examples shown<br>
	in Figs. 1 and 3. Fig. 1 is an example of an integral<br>
	module having a housing 2 which constitutes a module<br>
	and a hollow fiber membrane 1 which are fixedly adhered<br>
	to each other, and Fig. 2 shows a cross section in a<br>
25	line X-X shown in Fig. 1. In addition, Fig. 3 shows an<br>
	example of a cartridge type module composed of the<br>
	housing 2 (Fig. 4) and a hollow fiber membrane element<br>
	(Fig. 5), and Fig. 6 shows the cross section in a line<br><br>
15<br>
	X-X shown in Fig. 3. The "membrane chargeable region<br>
	in the inner side of an adhesively-fixed part"<br>
	according to the present invention means the region of<br>
	the inner surface of the adhesively-fixed part, and<br>
5	further means that the region can charge the membrane.<br>
	Specifically, the membrane chargeable region is the<br>
	region surrounded by a current cylinder 5 shown in Fig.<br>
	2, and is a region in the inner side of a cartridge<br>
	head 9 shown in fig. 6. Furthermore, the "neighboring<br>
10	region (A) of a nozzle" according to the present<br>
	invention means when the intersection points of the<br>
	central axis of the nozzle with an outer circumference<br>
	of the membrane chargeable region are defined as Zl and<br>
	Z2, a part of the membrane chargeable region contained<br>
15	in a circle drawn by setting intersecting point Z1 in a<br>
	closer side to the nozzle as the center and a distance<br>
	between intersecting point Z1 and center point Z3 of<br>
	the membrane chargeable region 3as a radius. In<br>
	addition, the "non-neighboring region (B) of a nozzle"<br>
20	means the region other than neighboring region (A) in<br>
	the membrane chargeable region, Futhermore, the<br>
	"first non^neighboring region (Bl)" means a part of<br>
	non-neighboring region (3) contained in a circle drawn<br>
	by setting intersection point Zl as the center and a<br>
25	distance between middle point Z4 of Z2 and Z3 and Z1 as<br>
	a radius. The "seognd non-neighboring region (B2)"<br>
	means a part of non-neighboring region (B) other than<br>
	the first non-neighboring region. In addition, the<br><br>
16<br>
	"membrane-occupying rate" according to the present<br>
	invention means a rate (percentage) of a total cross<br>
	section M of the membrane with inspect to an area S of<br>
	an objective region, and is determined by a method of<br>
5	dividing the area of the objective region into the<br>
	total cross section calculated from the number of the<br>
	hollow fiber membrane in the objective ragion and a<br>
	membrane outside diameter and by a method of analyzing<br>
	an image with the use of a computer.<br>
10	[0015]<br>
		In neighboring region (A), it is preferable<br>
	that membrane-occupying rate PC in every unit region<br>
	(C) constituting neighboring region (A) is 0.5 times or<br>
	more with reference to the membrane-occupying rate PA<br>
15	in neighboring region (A). PC is more preferably 0.6<br>
	times or more, and further preferably is 0.1 times or<br>
	more. This means that there is no remarkably nondense<br>
	local part in neighboring region (A), thereby can more<br>
	reliably prevent the membrane from being damaged or<br>
20	ruptured. Here, the "unit region (C)" means region (D)<br>
	divided by squares having a particular spacing<br>
	determined by a plurality of straight lines parallel<br>
	and orthogonal to a central axis of a nezzle when<br>
	considering intersection point 21 of the central axis<br>
25	of nozzle 3 and the membrane chargeable region as a<br>
	base point. The "particular spacing" is a value of 15R<br>
	when R is defined as an average value of the outside<br>
	diameter of the hollow fiber membrane. A divided<br><br>
17<br>
	section (D) in a peripheral part of neighboring region<br>
	(A) does not become to be a quadrangle having a length<br>
	corresponding to the particular spacing and thereby<br>
	having a defective part, but the divided section is<br>
5	combined with an adjacent divided section in a parallel<br>
	direction to the central axis of the nozzle so as to<br>
	form a region having an area of not less than 225R2 and<br>
	less than 450R2 lay the minimum number of coalescence,<br>
	and the coalescsnt regior, is considered as one unit<br>
10	region. At this time, when a coalescent region (D)<br>
	does not reacin 225R2 by combining only the adjacent<br>
	divided section in the parallel direction to the<br>
	central axis of the nozzle, the coalescent region (D)<br>
	is futher combined with one or two divided sections<br>
15	among the adjacent divided sections in the orthogonal<br>
	direction to the central axis with respect to those<br>
	divided sections. In this case, the divided sections<br>
	to be combined is selected so that the total area of<br>
	the coslescent region can be 225R2 or more and closest<br>
20	to 225R2. The procedure will be now specifically<br>
	described with reference to an example shown in Fig. 7.<br>
	Even when divided section (D17) is combined with the<br>
	adjacent divided section (D16), the coalescent region<br>
	does not reach the area of 225R2, and thus is further<br>
25	combined with divided section (Dl5) to form unit region<br>
	(C1). Furthermore, divided section (D14) is combined<br>
	with divided section (D13) to form unit region (C2),<br>
	and divided section (D11) is combined with divided<br><br>
18<br>
	section D12 to form unit region (C3). Furthermore,<br>
	divided section (D10) is combined with divided section<br>
	D9, divided section (D6) with divided section D7,<br>
	divided section (D5) with divided section (D4) and<br>
5	divided section (D1) with divided section (D2) to form<br>
	a unit region (C4), (C6), (C7) and (C9), respectively.<br>
	In this case, D8 and D3 singularly form unit region<br>
	(C5) and unit region (C8), respectively.<br>
	[0016]<br>
10		A non-neighboring region (B) preferably<br>
	contains at least one unit region (C) constituting non-<br>
	neighboring region (B), of which membrane-occupying<br>
	rate PC is less than 0.5 times with reference to<br>
	membrane-occupying rate PB in non-neighboring region<br>
15	(B). It is particularly preferable that a plurality of<br>
	unit regions (C) of which PC is less than 0.5 times<br>
	with reference to PB continuously exist from the center<br>
	of a membrane bundle to the outer circumference part<br>
	thereof. The membrane module having such distributed<br>
20	membrane bundles can further improve the<br>
	dischargeability of a deposit on the membrane surface,<br>
	and thereby can prevent fluid from being conccentrated<br>
	in neighiboring region (A) of a nozzle.<br>
	[0017]<br>
25		A cartridge type module as shown in Fig. 3 is<br>
	composed of a hollow fiber membrane element and a<br>
	housing having a nozzle in an upper side face, through<br>
	which caw water and/or fluid for cleaning enters and<br><br>
19<br>
	exits. In the hollow fiber membrane element both ends<br>
	of a plurality of the hollow fiber membranes are<br>
	adhesively fixed, the hollow part of the upper end of<br>
	the hollow fibfer membrane is opened, the hollow part of<br>
5	the lower end of the hollow fiber membrane is sealed,<br>
	and further a plurality of through holes are arranged<br>
	in a lower adhesively-fixed part. The hollow fiber<br>
	membrane element is accommodated into the housing and<br>
	is fluid-tightly fixed with a holder and a sealant. It<br>
10	is important to set the hollow fiber membrane element<br>
	so that 3a membrane-occupying rate in the membrane<br>
	chargeable region in the inner side of an upper<br>
	adhesively-fixed part is not uniform but has the dense<br>
	and nondense distributions, and further a region having<br>
15	a comparative low membrane-occupying rate is arranged<br>
	in the opposite side of the nozzle of the housing. As<br>
	a result of such a setting, the module of which a ratio<br>
	FB/PA of the membrane-occupying rates in neighboring<br>
	region (A) of the nozzle with reference to that in non-<br>
20	neighboring region (B) of the nozzle has a range of<br>
	0.50 or more but 0.95 or less shows an effect of the<br>
	present invention.<br>
	[0018]<br>
		The module according to the present invention<br>
25	preferably has a current plate 8 which is arranged to<br>
	hold the spacing between the hollow fiber membrane<br>
	bundle and the inner wall of the housing in the<br>
	vicinity of the nozzle. The current plate 8 may be<br><br>
20<br>
	arranged only in the vicinity at the nozzle in both<br>
	directions of an internal circumferential direction of<br>
	the housing and an axial direction of the housing as<br>
	shown in Fig. 8, but such a cylindrical body (a current<br>
5	cylinder) is preferable which is arranged in the<br>
	vicinity of the nozzle in the axial direction of the<br>
	housing and is set to surround the outer circumference<br>
	of a hollow fiber membrane bundle, as shown in Fig. 9.<br>
	It is particularly preferable that the current plate<br>
10	has no such hole as to penetrate through the wall<br>
	thereof in a region of the bilaterally symmetrical<br>
	range of 60 degrees to 120 degrees from the central<br>
	axis of the nozzle and has through holes in the other<br>
	region. The current plate has preferably such a length<br>
15	in the axial direction of the housing as to start in<br>
	the inner side of an adhesively-fixed part and extend<br>
	to a position over the opening of the nozzle in a<br>
	central side of the housing.<br>
		In addition, the module according to the<br>
20	present invention can also have the nozzle arranged in<br>
	the lower side face of a housing to introduce raw water<br>
	and/or a fluid for cleaning therein. Also, in this<br>
	case, it is preferable to arrange the above current<br>
	plate in the module.<br>
25	[0019]<br>
		The integral type hollow fiber membrane<br>
	module having characteristics according to the<br>
	invention and the hollow fiber membrane element<br><br>
21<br>
	constituting the cartridge type module having<br>
	characteristics according to the present invention can<br>
	be easily manufactured by previously introducing a<br>
	plurality of columnar materials into an ens of a hollow<br>
5	fiber membrane bundle, accommodating them in a vessel<br>
	for farming an adhesively-fixed part, and forming the<br>
	adhesively-fixed part by injecting the adhesive bond<br>
	and curing it.<br>
		The columnar material needs to heve a length<br>
10	of 0.3 times of more but 0.9 times or less with<br>
	reference to the thickness of an adhesively-fixed part,<br>
	and particularly preferably 0.5 times or more but less<br>
	than 0.8 times, in the adhesively-fixed part of<br>
	neighboring region (A). In addition, the length in the<br>
15	adhesively-fixed part of non-neighboring region (B) is<br>
	preferably 0.3 times or more but less than 1.0 time.<br>
	The module which uses the above columnar materials<br>
	having such length improves dischargeability for<br>
	suspensoid and shows the effect of reliably preventing<br>
20	the membrane from being damaged and ruptured.<br>
	[0020]<br>
		The columnar material can increase a bulk of<br>
	the hollow fiber membrane bundle by being inserted into<br>
	an end of the hollow fitter membrane bundle, and can<br>
25	control the distributed state of the hollow fiber<br>
	membrane, in other words, the dispersion of a membrane-<br>
	occupying rate, by being placed in an adequate<br>
	insertion point. A ratio PB/PA of membrane-occupying<br><br>
22<br>
	rates can be controlled to approximately 0.95, for<br>
	instance, by inserting a plurality of the columnar<br>
	materials so as to be uniformly distributed in a cross<br>
	section of the hollow fiber membrane bundles and<br>
5	spreading the hollow fiber membrane bundles into the<br>
	whole membrane chargeable region. Furthermore, the<br>
	ratio PB/PA of the membrane-occupying rates can be<br>
	controlled to approximately 0.50 by arranging the<br>
	columnar materials so that the comparative large<br>
10	amounts of them are distributed in non-neighboring<br>
	region (B) of the nozzle. In addition, the<br>
	distribution of the membrane-occupying rate can be<br>
	specifically controlled by (l) a method of changing the<br>
	density of the inserted points while using the columnar<br>
15	materials with the same thickness and (2) a method of<br>
	keeping the density of the insertion point constant and<br>
	changing the thickness of the columnar material.<br>
	[0021]<br>
		A cross-sectional shape of the columnar<br>
20	material is not limited in particular, and includes,<br>
	for instance, a circle, an elliptic shape, a polygon<br>
	such as a square, a hexagon and a star, and a tabular<br>
	shape. A preferred cross-sectional shape of the<br>
	columnar material is the circul or the elliptic shape<br>
25	which is not likely to damage a hollow fiber membrane<br>
	when the columnar material contacts with a fiber<br>
	membrane. In addition, when the shape of the columnar<br>
	material is a circle, an elliptic shape, a polygon such<br><br>
23<br>
	as a square, a hexagon or a star, the thickness is<br>
	preferably 5 times or more but 20 times or less with<br>
	reference to an outside diameter of the hollow fiber<br>
	membrane from the view point of easiness for<br>
5	controlling the distribution of the membrane. The<br>
	"thickness" described here means the diameter of an<br>
	estimated circle for a maximum cross section in a<br>
	longitudinal direction of the columnar material. The<br>
	outside diameter of the hollow fiber membrane is<br>
10	generally 0.6 to 2.5 mm, so that the thickness of the<br>
	columnar material is specifically selected by the range<br>
	of 3 to 50 mm, preferably by the range of 3 to 30 mm,<br>
	and particularly preferably by the range of 5 to 20 mm.<br>
	When the columnar material has a tabular shape, the<br>
15	average thickness is preferably 3 times or more but 15<br>
	times or less with reference to the outside diameter of<br>
	the hollow fiber membrane for the same reason as<br>
	described above. In addition, preferably, the shape of<br>
	the top of the columnar material is previously formed<br>
20	into such a shape as the columnar material can be<br>
	easily inserted into a hollow fiber mernbrane bundle,<br>
	specifically as a cone shape. The columnar material is<br>
	not particularly limited to a high polymer material, an<br>
	inorganic material and a metallic substance, but a<br>
25	preferred material is a substance having adhesive<br>
	strength with the adhesive bond which constitutes an<br>
	adhesively-fixed layer as well as having tensile<br>
	elasticity equal to or higher than that of the adhesive<br><br>
24<br>
bond.<br>
[0022]<br>
		In a method for manufacturing an external<br>
	pressure type hollow fiber membrane module according to<br>
5	the present invention, when the module is an integral<br>
	type, a vessel for forming an adhesively-fixed part can<br>
	be composed of a housing case itself and an end vessel<br>
	which is fluid-tightly fixed to the end of the housing<br>
	case. An adhesive bond may be injected from an<br>
10	adhesive-injacting port provided beforehand in the end<br>
	vessel, or can be directly injected from a nozzle<br>
	provided is the housing case. On the other hand, when<br>
	the module is a cartridge type having a hollow fiber<br>
	membrane element, the vessel for formimg the<br>
15	adhesively-fixed part is composed of a head member<br>
	constituting the element and an end vessel which is<br>
	fluid-tightly fixed to the head member. Alternatively,<br>
	the vessel for forming the adhesively-fixed part may be<br>
	made by integrating the head member with an end vessel<br>
20	pact so as to form a vessel shape. The adhesive bond<br>
	may be injected from the adhesive-injecting port<br>
	provided in the end vessel part, or can be directly<br>
	injected from an opening end of the head member (a part<br>
	into which the hollow fiber membrane bundle is<br>
25	inserted). Furthermore, in the hollow fiber membrane<br>
	element, the adhesively-fixed part can be composed of<br>
	only the adhesive bond and the hollow fiber membrane by<br>
	preparing the vessel for forming the adhesively—fixed<br><br>
25<br>
	part from a material having a low adhesive strength<br>
	with a cured adhesive bond; making it into a peelsble<br>
	structure; curing the adhesive bond; and then peeling<br>
	and removing the vessel.<br>
5	[0023]<br>
		In the manufacturing method according to the<br>
	present invention, the intaction/curring of the adhesive<br>
	bond may be conducted by the so-called centrifugal<br>
	adhesion method using the centrifugal force, or can be<br>
10	injected with the so-called settling adhesion method of<br>
	forcefully injecting the adhesive bond in a state of<br>
	leaving an adhesively-fined part at rest and curing it.<br>
	The centrifugal adhesion method is preferable because<br>
	the method uniformly forms a coating layer on the outer<br>
15	surface of a hollow fiber membrane at the inner surface<br>
	of the adhesively-fixed part, and thus hardly causes<br>
	the rupture of the membrane. When the centrifugal<br>
	adhesion method is employed, as a general rule, the<br>
	injection/curing of the adhesive bond is applied by<br>
20	horizontally setting the module in the state of<br>
	directing a nozzle upward and rotating it (for<br>
	instance, see Patent Document 1), but when the module<br>
	according to the peasant invention is manufactured with<br>
	the use of the centrifugal adhesion method, it is<br>
25	preferable to horizontally set the module in the state<br>
	of directing the nozzle more downward than the<br>
	horizontal position and rotate it. This is because<br>
	when the module is set in this stats of directing the<br><br>
26<br>
	nozzle downward, the module hardly forms the part<br>
	having a low membrane-occupying rate in neighboring<br>
	region (A) of a nozzle. In addition, when the<br>
	injection/curing of the adhesive bond is applied with<br>
5	the centrifugal adhesion method, it is preferable to<br>
	stop the rotation at a stage when the curing reaction<br>
	has proceeded to the extent that the adhesive bond is<br>
	not fluidized any more, and subsequfently to heat the<br>
	adhesive bond in an oven to complete the reaction so<br>
10	that the adhesive bond can reach to a practical cured<br>
	condition.<br>
	[0024]<br>
		The hollow fiber membrane used in the present<br>
	invention includes a reverse osmotic membrane, a nano<br>
15	filtration membrane, an ultrafilter membrane and a<br>
	precise filtration membrane.<br>
		The material for the hollow fiber membrane is<br>
	not particularly limited, and includes polysulfone,<br>
	palyetheraulfone, polyacrylonitrile, polyimide,<br>
20	polyetherimide, polyamide, poly etherketone,<br>
	polyetheretherketone, polyethylene, polypropylene,<br>
	poly (4-methyl pentene), ethylene-vinytalcohol<br>
	copolymer, cellulose, cellulose acetate, polyvinylidene<br>
	fluoride, ethylene-tetrafluoroethylene copolymer,<br>
25	polytetrafluoroethylene, and the composite materials<br>
	thereof.<br>
	[0025]<br>
		In addition, as for a preferable shape of a<br><br>
27<br>
	hollow fiber membrane, the inner diameter is preferably<br>
	50 to 3,000 m, and further preferably 500 to 2,000 m,<br>
	and the ratio of inner/outer diameter is preferably 0.3<br>
	to 0.3. Furthermore, the hollow fiber membrane<br>
5	preferably has a wave. When the hollow fiber membrane<br>
	has the wave, it can decrease the number of columnar<br>
	materials used for controlling the distribution of the<br>
	membrane-occupying rate.<br>
	[0026]<br>
10		The form of the wave, namely, the degree of<br>
	the wave is expressed by the crimping degree of the<br>
	hollow fiber bundle. The crimping degree is preferably<br>
	1.45 or more but less than 2.5, and particularly<br>
	preferably is 1.50 or more but 2.0 or less. When the<br>
15	module is made of the hollow fiber membrane bundle<br>
	having the crimping degree of the above range, the<br>
	module can control the distribution of membranes into a<br>
	predetermined membrane distribution by using a smaller<br>
	quantity of them, can prevent the membrane from being<br>
20	damaged and ruptured, and further can exert physical<br>
	cleaning effects without obstructing the oscillation of<br>
	the membrane in the housing. The crimping degree<br>
	described here is a value determined by bundling 1,000<br>
	hollow fiber membranes and putting it in order; winding<br>
25	a PET film with a thickness of 200 m and a width of 40<br>
	mm having a spring balance attached at an end around<br>
	the hollow fiber membrane bundle, pulling the spring<br>
	balance so as to apply the load of 1 kg onto, the<br><br>
28<br>
	bundle, measuring a peripheral length of the hollow<br>
	fiber membrane bundle in the condition, and calculating<br>
	the value according to the following expression.<br>
		Crimping degree = (peripheral length [m] / 2<br>
5	/ ((outside diameter of hollow fiber membrane [m])2 x<br>
	the number of hollow fiber in membranes).<br>
	[0027]<br>
		When manufacturing the hollow fiber membrane<br>
	module or the membrane element constituting the module<br>
10	by using a membrane having the above described wave,<br>
	the number of the above described columnar materials<br>
	can be reduced to 5 to 0 by controlling a ratio S2/S1<br>
	of the area S2 of a membrane chargeable region in the<br>
	end face of an adhesively-fixed part with reference to<br>
15	the area S1 Of the membrane chargeable region in the<br>
	inner side of the adhesively-fixed part to be 0.7 or<br>
	more but 0.9 or less. The ratio S2/S1 is particularly<br>
	preferable in a range of 0.80 or more but 0.90 or less.<br>
	[0028]<br>
20		The adhesive bond used in the present<br>
	invention preferably includes a high polymer material<br>
	of an epoxy resin, a urethane resin, an epoxy acrylate<br>
	resin, a silicon resin or the like. Among them, the<br>
	urethane resin is particularly preferable because of<br>
25	completing the reaction in a relatively short time. In<br>
	addition, the adhesively-fixed layer composed of the<br>
	adhesive bond needs to have such pressure resistance as<br>
	to endure a differential pressure generated during use,<br><br>
29<br>
	and thus has preferably adequate hardness. On the<br>
	other hand, in order to reliably prevent the hollow<br>
	fiber membrane from being ruptured due to the fluid<br>
	flow in physical cleaning for a longer period it is<br>
5	preferable to use the adhesive band having adequate<br>
	softness. Accordingly, in order to impart the pressure<br>
	resistance necessary and sufficient for use and<br>
	reliably prevent the rupture of the membrane, it is<br>
	preferable to use the adhesive bond having hardness<br>
10	between 70D and 50A in a range of operating<br>
	temperatures. The hardness described here means the<br>
	value shown by a shore hardness gauge in 10 seconds<br>
	after pushing it onto the surface of a sample<br>
	substantially having a smooth surface. When the above<br>
15	value exceeds 70D, the adhesively fixed layer may cause<br>
	the above described rupture of the membrane, and when<br>
	the value is lower than 50A, the pressure resistance of<br>
	the adhesively fixed layer may be insufficient.<br>
		In the next place, the present invention will<br>
20	be described with reference to examples and reference<br>
	examples.<br>

	into one bundle, and further were inserted in a housing<br><br>
30<br>
	case 2 having a head part in which a current cylinder 5<br>
	with the inside diameter of 154 mm is placed inside, as<br>
	described in Fig. 1. The head part has a nozzle 3 with<br>
	an inside diameter of 40 mm, and the central axis of<br>
5	the nozzle is the normal line of the head. The current<br>
	cylinder has a cylindrical shape having 240 through-<br>
	holes 40 with the diameter of 5 mm in a region except a<br>
	part of symmetrically forming 50 degrees in total with<br>
	respect to the nozzle central axis. The used hollow<br>
10	fiber membrane I had the pore size of 0.1 m, the<br>
	inside diameter of 0.65 mm and the outride diameter of<br>
	1.22 mm, and had a wave with the crimping degree of<br>
	1.65. Subsequently, 28 columnar bars (which were<br>
	previously formed by charging and spreadiny such an<br>
15	adhesive bond as described below into a mold and then<br>
	curing it) having the outside distneter of 11 mm were<br>
	inserted/placed into the end part of a membrane bundle<br>
	of a plugged hollow part side so as to be uniformly<br>
	distributed. In addition, 24 columnar bars with the<br>
20	outside diameter of 11 mm, wnich are made from<br>
	polyethylene, were inserted/placed into the end part of<br>
	a membrane bundle of an opened hollow part side so as<br>
	to be uniformly distributed. Subsequently, the<br>
	adhesive bond was injected into the head of the housing<br>
25	case by fixing an adhesion cup having a tube for<br>
	introducing the adhesive bond attached thereon at both<br>
	ends of the housing case, horizontally fixing the<br>
	housing case on a frame for centrifugation in a state<br><br>
31<br>
	of directing the nozzle downward at 45 degrees, and<br>
	horizontally rotating it. The used adhesive bond was a<br>
	two-component theremosetting type urethane resin which<br>
	is manufactured by Sanyu Rec Co., Ltd.: SA-6330A2/SA-<br>
5	6330B5 (product name)). When the fluidization of the<br>
	adhesive bond stopped due to the proceeding of the<br>
	curing reatction, the natation of a centrifugal machine<br>
	was stopped, and then the housing case was taken out<br>
	and heated at 50°C in an oven to be cured. Then, the<br>
10	end of the housing case was cut to open a hollow part<br>
	in the side in which the hollour part was plugged in a<br>
	stage before being adhesively bonded, and all the<br>
	columnar bars which are made from polyethylen in an<br>
	opposite end were removed to form through holes. The<br>
15	present membrane of the module had an active length of<br>
	2m.<br>
		Subsequently, the housing case was joined<br>
	with caps 6a and 6b through O-rings 7a and 7b by using<br>
	housing nuts 8a and 8b, and then the module was<br>
20	attached to a filtering device in the state of<br>
	directing an opened hollow part side upward, and was<br>
	subjected to physical cleaning durability tests as<br>
	described below.<br>
		Clean water was supplied into the module from<br>
25	a side of an upper adhesively-fixed part 4a at the flow<br>
	rate of 8 m3/hr, and simultaneously air was supplied<br>
	therein from a side of a lower adhesively-fixed part 4b<br>
	at the flow rate of 7 m3/hr. Both of supplied fluids<br><br>
32<br>
	were discharged through the nozzle of the upper head.<br>
	The above described operation was continued except the<br>
	time of a leak test which was carried out every one<br>
	month. In addition, a water temperature was held at 5°C<br>
5	during the operation.<br>
		Even after the operation for six months, a<br>
	leak due to the rupture of a membrane did not occur.<br>
	This operation period is equivalent to the operation<br>
	period of ten years or more in terms of a practical<br>
10	filtration operation.<br>
		After the test was finished, the inner part<br>
	of the upper adhesively-fixed part of the module was<br>
	cut, the membrane was picked off, and an adhesively<br>
	bonded surface was observed in detail. When having<br>
15	taken a photograph of the inner surface of the<br>
	adhesively—fixed part, enlarged the photograph to an A3<br>
	size, and measured a distributed state of a hollow<br>
	fiber membrane, PA, FBI and PB2 was 0.44, 0.43 and 0.34<br>
	respectively, the ratio PB/PA of membrane-occupying<br>
20	rates was 0.89, and the membrane-occupying rate PC in<br>
	every unit region (C) was 0.8 to 1.2 times with<br>
	reference to the membrane-occupying rate PA in<br>
	neighboring region (A). However, there was only one<br>
	unit region (C) having the five membrane-occupying rate of<br>
25	less than 0.5 times with reference to the membrane-<br>
	occupying rate PB in the contour part of a bundle in<br>
	the second non-neighboring region (B2).<br>
		Subsequently, an adhesively-fixed part was<br><br>
33<br>
	cut at a position of 5 mm distant from the inner<br>
	surface of the upper adhesively-fixed part to form a<br>
	smooth cross section, and the hardness of the adhesive-<br>
	bond part of the cut surface was measured. As a<br>
5	result, Shore hardness was 65D at 5°C and was 40D at<br>
	40°C.<br>
		In addition, a length of the columnar bar<br>
	inserted an the adhesively-fixed part was 50 mm, while<br>
	the length of the upper adhesively-fixed part was 65<br>
10	mm, and the ratio was 0.77.<br>
	[0030]<br>
	Example 2<br>
		A hollow fiber membrane element as shown in<br>
	Fig. 5 which includes a cartridge head 9 haying a flat<br>
15	flange; a lower ring 11 having 24 through holes with<br>
	the diameter of 11 mm and having a protrusion part with<br>
	a length of 40 mm; and two pipe-shaped struts (10)<br>
	which are made from SUS with an outside diameter of 10<br>
	mm and a wall thikness of 1 mn was prepared by using<br>
20	6,600 hollow fiber membranes as in the case of Example<br>
	1. The strut was arranged in the outermost<br>
	circumference of a hollow fiber membrane bundle, and<br>
	was adhesively fixed with the use of the hollow fiber<br>
	membrane and a two-component thermosetting type<br>
25	urethane resin (which is manufactured by Sanyu Rec Co.,<br>
	Ltd: SA-6330A2/SA-6330 B4 (product name). The<br>
	cartridge head was integrally formed with an end vessel<br>
	part, and has a port for introducing adhesive bond in<br><br>
34<br>
	the end vessel part. The hollow fiber membrane bundle<br>
	was adhesively bonded with the cartridge head and the<br>
	lower ring by setting the end part of the membrane<br>
	bundle which was present in the side where a hollow<br>
5	part was plugged inside the cartridge head without<br>
	placing any particular insert in the bundle, setting<br>
	the end part of the membrane bundle in the side where<br>
	the hollow part was opened inside a lower ring, and<br>
	then inserting/fixing 24 columnar bars made from<br>
10	polyethylen in the hollow fiber membrane bundle through<br>
	holes in the lower ring, horizontally fixing them on a<br>
	holder for adhesion, and adhesively bonding them with a<br>
	centrifugal method in the fixed state. The adhesive<br>
	bond was settled at room temperature and cured by<br>
15	heating as in the ease of Example 1, the end vessel<br>
	part of the cartridge head was cut to open the hollow<br>
	part in the end of the hollow fiber membrane, and the<br>
	columnar bars which are made from polyethylen were<br>
	pulled out from the lower ring to form the through<br>
20	holes. The present hollow fiber membrane element had<br>
	an active length of 2 m.<br>
		The inside diameters of the cartridge head<br>
	and the lower ring were respectively 155 mm and 144 mm,<br>
	and the thicknesses of adhesive layers in the cartridge<br>
25	head and the lower ring were respectively 65 mm and 30<br>
	mm. In addition, the inside diameter of an end vessel<br>
	part in a cut end was 140 mm, and S2/S1 was 0.82. In<br>
	an adhesively-fixed part in the cartridge head side, it<br><br>
35<br>
	was observed that the hollow fiber membranes were<br>
	nondensely fixed on the part which had been placed in<br>
	the upper side when they were adhesively bonded with a<br>
	centrifugal method.<br>
5		In membrane module as shown in Fig. 3 (where<br>
	7c shows an O-ring for a cartridge) was prepared by<br>
	employing a case as shown in Fig. 4, which is similar<br>
	to Example 1 except that the case had no nozzle and<br>
	current cylinder in a lower side face, as a Housing;<br>
10	and accommodating the above described hollow fiber<br>
	membrane element in the housing. When accommodating<br>
	the hollow fiber membrane element, the side in the<br>
	comparative nondense state of the hollow fiber membrane<br>
	was set sc as to be an opposite side to an exhavst port<br>
15	provided in the housing. The positional relationship<br>
	between the side in the comparative nondense state and<br>
	the exhaust port set at the time was inscribed on the<br>
	cartridge head.<br>
		The above described module was attached to a<br>
20	rack device, and was subjected to a physical cleaning<br>
	durability test as in the case of Example 1.<br>
		Even after the operation for six months, a<br>
	leak due to the rapture of a membrane did not occur.<br>
		After having finished the test, an<br>
25	adhesively—bonded surface was observed in detail as in<br>
	the case of Example l. As a result, PA, PB1 and PB2<br>
	were 0.48, 0.40 and 0.24 respectively, and the ratio<br>
	PB/PA of membrane-occupying rates was 0.70, and further<br><br>
36<br>
	the membrane-occupying rate PC in every unit region (C)<br>
	was 0.7 times to 1.6 times with reference to the<br>
	membrane-occupying rate PA in neighboring region (A).<br>
	In the region of from the first non-neighboring region<br>
5	(Bl) to the bundles in the contour part of the second<br>
	non-neighboring region (B2), there were three unit<br>
	regions (C) having the membrane-occupying rate of less<br>
	than 0.5 times PB.<br>
		Subsequently, an adhesively-fixed part was<br>
10	cut at a position of 5 mm distant from the inner<br>
	surface of the adhesively-fixed part in a cartridge<br>
	head to form a smooth cross section, and the hardness<br>
	of the adhesive-bond part of the cut surface was<br>
	measured. As a result, Shore hardness was 53D at 5oC<br>
15	and 37D at 40°C.<br>
	[0031]<br>
	Example 3<br>
		With the use of 6,400 hollow fiber membranes<br>
	made from PVDF (which is manufactured by Asahi Chemical<br>
20	Industry), of which each had a pore size of 0.1 m, an<br>
	inside diameter of 0.68 mm, an outside diameter of 1.25<br>
	mm and no wave, a module was prepared as in the case of<br>
	Example 1 except that 14 columnar bars were inserted<br>
	into a half region of a membrane bundle in a nozzle<br>
25	side and 18 columnar bars into the region in the<br>
	opposite side to the nozzle.<br>
		The module was subjected to a physical<br>
	cleaning durability test as in the case of Example l,<br><br>
37<br>
	and as a result, even after the operation for six<br>
	months, a leak due to the rupture of a membrane did not<br>
	occur.<br>
		After the test was finished/ the hollow fiber<br>
5	membrane module was cut in the inner side of an<br>
	adhesively-fixed part in a cartridge head, the membrane<br>
	was picked off, and the adhesively-bonded surface was<br>
	observed in detail. When having taken a photograph of<br>
	the inner surface of the adhesively-fixed part,<br>
l0	enlarged the photograph to an A3 size, and measured a<br>
	distributed state of a hollow fiber membrane, PA, FBI<br>
	and PB2 was 0.46, 0.44 and 0.30 respectively, the ratio<br>
	PB/PA of membrane-occupying rates was 0.83/ and the<br>
	membrane-occupying rate PC in every unit region (C) was<br>
15	0.7 co 1.4 times with reference to the membrane-<br>
	oceupying rate PA in a neighboring region (A). In the<br>
	region of from the first non-neighboring, region (Bl) to<br>
	the bundles in the contour part of the second non-<br>
	neighboring region (B2), there were two unit regions<br>
20	(C) having the membrane-occupying rate of less than 0.5<br>
	times PB.<br>
		In addition, a length of the columnar bar<br>
	inserted at the adhesively-fixed part was 45 mm, while<br>
	the length of the upper adhesively-fixed part was 65<br>
25	mm, and the ratio was 0.69.<br>
	[0032]<br>
	Example 4<br>
		The membrane bundle of 6,400 hollow fiber<br><br>
38<br>
	membranes which were made from PVDF as in the case of<br>
	Example 3 was divided into four parts, and a cross<br>
	plate as shown in Figs. 10A to 10C was inserted into<br>
	them. The cross plate had the thickness of 5 mm, and<br>
5	had such a shape as one side was longer than the other<br>
	side by 20 mm. The membrane bundle was inserted into a<br>
	housing case similar to Example l, and was set therein<br>
	so that the long side of the cross plate could be<br>
	placed at a position completely opposite to a nozzle.<br>
10	Subsequently, six columnar bars similar to those in<br>
	Example 1 were inserted into each of two fractions of a<br>
	side close to the nozzle among the membrane bundles<br>
	divided into four fractions, and eight columnar bars<br>
	were inserted into each of two fractions in the side<br>
15	opposite to the nozzle. After that, the module was<br>
	prepared as in the case of Example 1.<br>
		The module was subjected to a physical<br>
	cleaning durability test as in the case of Example 1,<br>
	and as a result, after the operation for six months,<br>
20	there is only one membrane that caused a leak after the<br>
	operation period of six months.<br>
		After the test was finished, the hollow fiber<br>
	membrane module was cut in the inner side of an<br>
	adhesively-fixed part in a cartridge head, and the<br>
25	leaking part was observed. As a result, one membrane<br>
	in the part corresponding to the position of the cross<br>
	plate in the second non-neighboring region was ruptured<br>
	at the adhesive interface. Further, the hollow fiber<br><br>
39<br>
	membrane was picked off and the adhesively-bonded<br>
	surface was observed in detail. As a result, there<br>
	existed no membranes in the width of about 3 mm in the<br>
	part where the long side of the cross plate was buried.<br>
5	When having taken a photograph of the inner surface of<br>
	the adhesively-fixed part; enlarged the photograph to<br>
	an A3 size; and measured a distributed state of a<br>
	hollow fiber membrane, PA, PB1 and PB2 were 0.43, 0.42<br>
	and 0.37 respectively, the ratio PB/PA of membrane-<br>
10	occupying rates was 0.93, and the membrane-occupying<br>
	rate PC in every unit region (C) was 0.7 to 1.4 times<br>
	with reference to the membrane-occupying rats PA in<br>
	neighboring region (A). In the region of from the<br>
	first non-neighbering region (B1) to the contour part<br>
15	of bundles in the second non-neighboring region (B2),<br>
	there were serial three unit regions (C) having the<br>
	membrane-occupving rate of less than 0.5 times PB.<br>
		In addition, a length of the columnar bar<br>
	inserted in the adhesively-fixed part was 45 mm, while<br>
20	the length of the upper adhesively-fixed part was 65<br>
	mm, and the ratio was 0.69. In addition, the long side<br>
	and short side of the cross plate were 55 mm and 35 mm<br>
	respectively, and ths ratios were 0.85 and 0.54<br>
	respectively.<br>
25	[0033]<br>
	Comparative Example 1<br>
		A hollow fiber membrane module was prepared<br>
	as in the case of Example I except that an insert was<br><br>
40<br>
	not used when an upper adhesively-fixed part was formed<br>
	and the hollow fiber membrane was adhesively-bonded<br>
	with a centrifugal method in the state of having<br>
	directed a nozzle upward according to a general rule.<br>
5		The module was subjected to a physical<br>
	cleaning durability test as in the case of Example 1,<br>
	and as a result, the leaks occurred in two membranes<br>
	after one month, and the leads occurred in 20 or more<br>
	membranes in cumulative total after two months. The<br>
10	test was finished at this time, and the membrane module<br>
	was disassembled. As a result, every membrane having<br>
	caused the leak was ruptured in the side close to a<br>
	nozzle of the upper adhesively-fixed part.<br>
		when having observed the distributed state of<br>
15	the hollow fiber membrane as in the case of Example 1,<br>
	there nondensely existed the membrane in a nozzle side<br>
	of a housing, and there existed no membrane in the<br>
	region of about 10 cm2. As a result of the measurement<br>
	of the cistributed state, the ratio PB/PA of membrane-<br>
20	occupying rates showed 2.5.<br>
	[0034]<br>
	Comparative Example 2<br>
		When having accommodated a hollow fiber<br>
	membrane element prepared as in the case of Example 2<br>
25	into a housing, the element was set so that the side in<br>
	the comparative nondense state in an adhesively-fixed<br>
	pare of a cartridge head could be closest to a nozzle<br>
	provided in the housing. The positional relationship<br><br>
41<br>
	between the side in the comparative nondense state and<br>
	the nozzle at the time vas inscribed on the cartridge<br>
	head, and then the module was subjected to a physical<br>
	cleaning durability test as in the case of Example 1.<br>
5		A leak occurred in one membrane after one<br>
	month, and the leaks occurred in 5 membranes in<br>
	cumulative total after 3 months, and in 36 membranes in<br>
	cumulative total after 6 months. The test was finished<br>
	at this moment, and the membrane module was<br>
10	disassembled. As a result, every membrane having<br>
	caused the leak was ruptured in the side close to a<br>
	nozzle of the upper adhesively-fixed part.<br>
		When having measured the distributed state of<br>
	the hollow fiber membrane as in the case of Example 2,<br>
15	the ratio PS/PA of membrane-occupying rates showed 1.9.<br>
	[0035]<br>
	Example 5<br>
		Modules prepared by methods described in<br>
	Examples 1 to 4 and Comparative Examples 1 and 2 were<br>
20	attached to a rack device, and were subjected to the<br>
	filtration of 1 m3 of a model liquid of which the<br>
	turbidity was adjusted to 1,000 ppm by adding mud in<br>
	river bottom thereto, and then cleaning it by passing<br>
	back wash water at the flow rate of 8 m3/hr for one<br>
25	minute and air at the flow rate of 5 N-m3/h. After the<br>
	operation of filtration and cleaning was repeated five<br>
	times, each module was disassembled, and the state in a<br>
	membrane bundle in the vicinity of an upper adhesively-<br><br>
42<br>
	fixed part was observed.<br>
		It was observed that a large quantity of<br>
	sludge accumulated in a part of second non-neighboring<br>
	region in Comparative Examples 1 and 2. In contrast to<br>
5	this, a small quantity of sludge accumulated only in<br>
	one part of first non-neighboring region in Example 1,<br>
	and little sludge accumulated in Examples 2 and 3. In<br>
	Example 4, a small quantity of sludge accomulated only<br>
	in one part of the neighboring region.<br>

materia1, and has the hardness of 50A to 70D in a range<br>
of operating temperatures.<br>
9.		A method for manufacturing the external<br>
pressure type hollow fiber membrane module according to<br>
claim 1 or 2 including: previously inserting a<br>
plurality of columnar materials into an end of a hollow<br>
fiber membrane bundle at least in a side of making a<br>
hollow part opened accommodating the hollow fiber<br>
membrane bundle which keeps the state of the insertion<br>
in a vessel for forming an adhesively-fixed part;<br>
injecting an adhesive bond into the vessel and curing<br>
it; then cutting an end face of the hollow fiber<br>
membrane bundle to form the adhesively-fixed part; and<br>
consequently making the columnar materials having a<br>
length of 0.3 to 0.9 times with reference to a<br>
thickness of the adhesively-fixed part exist at least<br>
in the adhesively-fixed part of a neighboring region<br>
(A).<br>
10.		A method for manufacturing the external<br>
pressure type hollow fiber membrane module according to<br>
claim 1 including: accommodating a hollow fiber<br>
membrane bundle in a housing case having a nozzle for<br>
allowing a fluid to enter and exit therefrom at least<br>
on one side face; horizontally rotating the housing<br>
case in a state of keeping the nozzle directing toward<br><br>
47<br>
a lower direction than a horizontal direction:<br>
injecting an adhesive bond into the housing case under<br>
the centrifugal force; and curing it to form an<br>
adhesively-fixed part.<br><br>
			An external pressure type hollow fiber<br>
	membrane module, comprising a hollow fiber membrane<br>
	bundle formed, of a plurality of hollow fiber membranes,<br>
	a housing, and an inlet/outlet nozzle for fluid,<br>
	wherein hollow fiber membranes are fixedly adhered to<br>
	each other and the hollow fiber membranes are fixedly<br>
	adhered to the inner wall of the housing at both ends<br>
	of the hollow fiber membrane bundle. The hollow part<br>
	at one or both side adhesively-fixed ends is opened,<br>
	and the inlet/outlet nozzle for fluid is installed at<br>
	the side face of the housing at least at one<br>
	adhesively-fixed end in which the hollow part is<br>
	opened. Where the membrane occupied rates of the<br>
	nozzle in a neighboring area (A) and a non-neighboring<br>
	area (B) among membrane chargeable areas on the inside<br>
	of the adhesively-fixed part at at least one<br>
	adhesively-fixed end positioned near the nozzle and<br>
	where the hollow part is opened are PA and SB, the<br>
	ratio of the membrane occupied rates PB/PA is 0.50 to<br>
	0.95.<br></td>
