				<td>AN ANTENNA SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR MEASURING<br>
AZIMUTH AND ELEVATION ANGLES OF AN ACTIVE,<br>
SIGNAL SENDING RADIOSONDE<br>
The present invention relates to an antenna system for measuring the azimuth and<br>
elevation angles of an active, signal sending radiosonde, as described hereinafter.<br>
The invention relates also to a method for measuring the azimuth and elevation of<br>
an active, signal sending radiosonde.<br>
The present invention is related to atmospheric sounding systems, in which the<br>
properties of the atmosphere are measured in-situ by independent, self powered<br>
active components typically called radiosondes including a radio transmitter.<br>
Typical features for this technique are inactive (non-sending) receiving antennas<br>
and the fact that the measuring device (radiosonde) is either lifted or dropped<br>
through the space to be measured.<br>
Parameters measured in-situ by sensors of the radiosonde, such as air pressure,<br>
temperature and relative humidity, are transmitted through a telemetry link to a<br>
receiving station. Other parameters of interest are wind speed and wind direction<br>
that can be measured by using navigation aid networks such as GPS or Loran-C,<br>
by a primary or secondary radar, or by a passive (non-sending) and independent<br>
(no navigation aid networks used) radiotheodolite. Height of the radiosonde can<br>
be calculated from the air pressure, temperature and humidity data.<br>
The object of the invention is to determine the azimuth and elevation angles of an<br>
active radiosonde in a three dimensional space with a passive (non-sending)<br>
antenna structure independent of navigation aid networks. A typical application of<br>
the invention is to locate a radiosonde launched into the atmosphere with the help<br>
of a balloon filled with hydrogen or helium. Radiosonde azimuth and elevation<br>
angles are determined from the received radiosonde signal.<br><br>
Wind speed and direction can be calculated from consecutive azimuth and<br>
elevation angles and height of the radiosonde.<br>
Prior solutions in the 1680 MHz meteorological frequency band track the<br>
radiosonde mechanically both in the azimuth and elevation directions. The<br>
disadvantage of this solution is the complicated and expensive mechanical<br>
receiving antenna structure.<br>
Another disadvantage of the prior solutions is the disability to attenuate ground<br>
reflections enough when the radiosonde signal is received from a low elevation<br>
angle.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to overcome the problems of the prior<br>
solutions and to provide an entirely novel type of antenna structure and a method<br>
for determining the azimuth and elevation angles of a radiosonde.<br>
The goal of the invention is achieved by a fixedly backwards tilted antenna field,<br>
in which the antenna elements are assembled on an antenna frame. In one typical<br>
embodiment the antenna field is rotated around vertical axis approximately to the<br>
direction of the radiosonde while the elevation angle remains essentially constant.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention there are at least three such fixedly tilted<br>
antenna fields that point to different fixed azimuth directions. This solution has no<br>
moving parts.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides an antenna system for measuring<br>
azimuth and elevation angles of an active, signal sending radiosonde, which<br>
antenna system comprises<br>
a first passive antenna group comprising at least two antenna arrays, the direction<br>
pattern of which is wide at least in elevation plane for measuring azimuth angle of<br>
the radiosonde based on the phase differences between the antenna arrays and the<br>
rotational position of the antenna field, a second passive antenna group<br>
comprising at least two antenna arrays, the direction pattern of which is wide at<br><br>
least in elevation plane for measuring the elevation angle of the radiosonde based<br>
on the phase differences between the antenna arrays, and at least one third antenna<br>
element having high gain for receiving the telemetry signal, the direction pattern<br>
of which element is narrow in azimuth plane and wide in elevation plane,<br>
characterized in that first and second antenna groups form a solid antenna field,<br>
and antenna field is fixedly tilted in a predetermined elevation position.<br>
The presecnt invention also provides a method for measuring azimuth and<br>
elevation angles of an active, signal sending radiosonde, in which method the<br>
azimuth angle of the radiosonde is measured based on the phase differences of the<br>
received radiosonde signals between the antenna arrays and the rotational position<br>
of the antenna field with a first passive antenna group comprising at least two<br>
antenna array, the direction pattern of which is wide at least in elevation plane, the<br>
elevation angle of the radiosonde is measured based on the phase differences of<br>
the received radiosonde signals between the antenna arrays with a second passive<br>
antenna group comprising at least two antenna array, the direction pattern of<br>
which is wide at least in elevation plane, and the telemetry signal is received with<br>
at least one third antenna element having high gain, the direction pattern of which<br>
element is narrow in azimuth plane and wide in elevation plane, characterized in<br>
that first and second antenna groups form a solid antenna field, and antenna field<br>
is fixedly tilted in a predetermined elevation position.<br>
The invention offers significant benefits.<br>
By attenuating the ground reflection the azimuth and elevation angles of the<br>
radiosonde can be measured more precisely especially when the radiosonde is in a<br>
low elevation angle.<br>
The mechanics of the antenna structure can be simplified and manufactured at a<br>
lower cost. Furthermore the reliability of the system is increased as there are less<br>
moving parts.<br><br>
In the following, the invention will be examined in greater detail with the help of<br>
exemplary embodiments by making reference to the accompanying drawings in<br>
which:<br>
Figure la shows in a perspective view a rotatable antenna structure in accordance<br>
with the invention.<br>
Figure lb shows a simplified version of the embodiment of figure la.<br>
Figure 2 shows in a perspective view a stationary antenna structure in accordance<br>
with the second embodiment of the invention.<br>
Figure 3 shows schematically a balloon borne radiosonde, direct signal, ground<br>
reflection, rotatable antenna structure and a typical radiation pattern witfi a gain<br>
pattern minimum (null) in the direction of the ground reflection.<br>
Figure 4 shows a polar-plot of a typical radiation pattern for a two-element<br>
antenna array with a gain pattern minimum (null) in the direction of the ground<br>
reflection.<br>
Figure 5 shows schematically as a side view the phasing of a two-element antenna<br>
array.<br>
In accordance with figure 1 the essentially planar antenna field 1 comprises a<br>
vertical antenna group 12 and a horizontal antenna group 13. The vertical antenna<br>
group 12 comprises at least two antenna arrays 10a and 10b positioned above each<br>
other. In this solution each array comprises three antenna elements 9. The<br>
direction pattern of these arrays 10a and 10b is wide in elevation plane.<br>
The vertical antenna group 10a and 10b is used for determining the elevation<br>
angle of the radiosonde based on the phase differences of the received radiosonde<br>
signal between the antenna arrays 10a, 10b.<br><br>
Respectively horizontal antenna group 13 comprises two horizontal antenna arrays<br>
11a and lib positioned at least essentially symmetrically around the vertical<br>
center line of the antenna field 1. In this solution each array comprises two or<br>
more antenna elements 9. The direction pattern of these arrays 11a and 1 lb is also<br>
wide in elevation plane.<br>
The azimuth angle of the radiosonde is determined with arrays 11a and 1 lb based<br>
on the phase differences between the antenna arrays 11a, lib and the rotational<br>
position of the antenna field 1.<br>
One preferable embodiment 1 of the invention includes only one rotatable support<br>
frame divided in upper 6 and lower parts 14. The antenna field 1 with its frame 2<br>
is mounted on a stationary tripod 3 having circular support plates 4 at the end of<br>
its legs 5. An independent antenna 8 is for radiosonde telemetry. The antenna<br>
frame is rotatable around the vertical axis 7 for directing the antenna field 1<br>
approximately to the direction of the radiosonde. The azimuth angle is measured<br>
with the horizontal antenna group 13 on the lower part 14 of the frame and<br>
elevation angle with help of the vertical antenna group 12 positioned on the upper<br>
and lower parts 6 and 14 of the frame. A simplified version of the antenna groups<br>
required for the angle measurement is presented is the figure lb. The tilting angle<br>
a is typically 30°. The term "fixed tilting" or "fixed tilting angle" in this context<br>
means also solutions, where a small vibrational deviation of the tilting angle is<br>
allowed for example due to the wind.<br>
Due to the antenna group 13 for azimuth measurement, the antenna field 1 forms<br>
an inverted T- or L-shape. With this solution a low center of gravity and wind load<br>
can be achieved. Obviously, the azimuth antenna group 13 can be positioned also<br>
in the upper part 6 or center of the antenna field 1 within the scope of the<br>
inventive idea, whereby a T-, inverted L- or plus (+) shape is formed. The<br>
invention does not limit the azimuth and elevation antenna groups to be<br>
perpendicular to each other or the ground, thereby allowing, for instance, also an<br>
X-shape antenna field.<br><br>
Radiosonde telemetry reception is independent of azimuth and elevation<br>
measurements. The telemetry signal is received by a separate high gain directional<br>
antenna 8. The direction pattern of the antenna 8 is typically narrow in azimuth<br>
plane and wide in elevation plane.<br>
Figure lb represents a simplified version of the antenna structure of figure la. In<br>
this version each antenna array is replaced by single antenna elements 9.<br>
Figure 2 represents another embodiment of the invention in a form of a fixed<br>
pyramid shaped antenna with four tilted antenna fields 14. The azimuth angle is<br>
measured with horizontal antenna group 20 comprising two antenna arrays 18a<br>
and 18b at the bottom of the pyramid. Arrays include two or more antenna<br>
elements 16. Elevation angle is measured with vertical antenna group 19<br>
comprising two vertically positioned antenna arrays 17a and 17b in the upper and<br>
lower parts of the pyramid. The telemetry signal is received by a separate<br>
directional antenna 15 positioned on the top of the pyramid.<br>
In both of the before described solutions the azimuth angle is determined from the<br>
measured phase difference of at least two antenna elements or arrays in the<br>
horizontal direction (horizontal groups 13 or 20) and the direction of the antenna<br>
field 14.<br>
The elevation angle is determined from the measured phase difference of at least<br>
two antenna elements or arrays essentially in the vertical direction (vertical groups<br>
12 or 19).<br>
In accordance with figure 3 the purpose of the antenna system 34 is to obtain a<br>
direct radio signal 32 from the radiosonde 31. When the radiosonde 31 is in a low<br>
elevation angle, ground reflection 30 coming from the (negative) mirror angle has<br>
been a major factor degrading the performance of prior solutions. The present<br>
invention decreases this problem by aligning a gain pattern minimum 35 (null) of<br>
the radiation pattern 33 to the direction of the ground reflection 30. The direction<br>
is typically determined experimentally for different elevation angles by aligning<br><br>
the main beam by phased array techniques such that the ground reflection is<br>
minimized.<br>
In accordance with figure 4 the gain pattern minimum (null) is formed by an<br>
antenna array (10a, 10b, 11a, 1lb, or 17a, 17b, 18a, 18b) which consists of at least<br>
two antenna elements (9 or 16). Gain pattern minimum (null) 30 is directed by<br>
modifying the signal phase and amplitude of each antenna element in the array<br>
(beamforming).<br>
According to figure 5 the sum of the modified signals represents the antenna array<br>
that can now be regarded as a single antenna element with a more suitable<br>
radiation pattern. A gain pattern minimum (null) is formed separately for each of<br>
the antenna arrays in the horizontal and vertical groups (12, 13 or 19, 20).<br><br>
Phase shift is designed experimentally for different elevation angles (radiation<br>
patterns). Antenna beam forming is explained in more detail e.g., in reference<br>
Robert J Mailloux, Phased Array Antenna Handbook, Chapters 2 and 3, 1994<br>
Artech House, Inc, ISBN 0-89006-502-0.<br>
In accordance with figure 6 the angle of arrival can be measured with two<br>
identical antennas Al and A2 using interferometric principle explained in more<br>
detail e.g., in reference Englar, Mango, Roettcher, Watters, FINAL REPORT<br>
FOR THE MININTRACK TRACKING FUNCTION DESCRIPTION, Volume<br>
1, March 1973, NASA-TMX-66213. If the base length (b) is less or equal than<br>
half of the wavelength (A/2) the unambiguous angle of arrival (-90 °
can be measured. When the phase difference (0) between antenna Al'&amp;and A2 has<br>
been measured (-180 °
calculated as:<br><br><br>
Instead of the planar antenna field 1 or 14 shown in figures la, lb and 2 the<br>
antenna field may be also convex, concave or for example stepped. In the<br>
rotatable embodiments of figures la and lb all the antennas, antenna arrays and<br>
antenna elements are positioned on this uniform rigid antenna field 1 regardless of<br>
the shape of the antenna field. In the embodiment of figure 2 the telemetry<br>
antenna 15 is not included to this antenna field 14.<br>
In this application with wide beam is meant beam widths greater than 120°.<br>
Respectively narrow beam means beam widths smaller than 30°.<br><br>
