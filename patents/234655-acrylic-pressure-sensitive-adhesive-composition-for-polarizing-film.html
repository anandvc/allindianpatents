				<td>ACRYLIC     PRESSURE-SENSITIVE     ADHESIVE     COMPOSITION     FOR POLARIZING FILM<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The   present   invention   relates   to   an   acrylic   pressure-sensitive   adhesive composition for a polarizing film, more particularly to a pressure-sensitive adhesive composition for a polarizing film capable of solving the problem of light leakage, a polarizing film prepared using the same and a liquid crystal display employing the same. Description of the Related Art<br>
Basically, a liquid crystal cell containing liquid crystal, a polarizing film and an adhesive layer or a pressure-sensitive adhesive layer for joining the two are required to manufacture a liquid crystal display. In addition, a phase retardation film, a compensation film for wide view angle, a brightness enhancement film, etc. may be further attached to the polarizing film to improve performance of the liquid crystal display.<br>
Typically, a liquid crystal display comprises a uniformly aligned liquid crystal layer; a polarizing film comprising a liquid crystal cell, which consists of a transparent glass plate or a plastic plate including a transparent electrode layer and an adhesive layer or a pressure-sensitive adhesive layer; a phase retardation film; and additional functional film layers.<br>
The polarizing film consists of a uniformly aligned iodine compound or dichroic polarizing material. To protect these polarizing elements, a protection film made of triacetyl cellulose (TAC), etc. is used. The polarizing film may further comprise a phase retardation film having an anisotropic molecular alignment, a compensation film for wide view angle such as an optically designed liquid crystal film, etc.<br>
Because the aforementioned films are made of materials having different molecular structures and compositions, they have different physical properties. Especially, under a specific thermal and/or humidity condition, materials having an anisotropic molecular alignment shrink or expand, which causes the lack of dimensional stability. As a result, if the polarizing film is fixed by a pressure-sensitive adhesive, a shear stress caused the thermal and/or humidity condition remains, so that light leakage occurs at the region where the stress is concentrated.<br>
One way to solve the problem of light leakage is to reduce the shrinkage of the<br><br>
polarizing film at the thermal and/or humidity condition. However, it is very difficult to remove the stress applied to a liquid crystal panel to which a polarizing film consisting of different materials has been attached.<br>
Rubbers, acryls and silicones are commonly used as pressure-sensitive adhesives. Among  these,  acrylic  pressure-sensitive  adhesives  are  used the  most  widely  in manufacturing high performance pressure-sensitive adhesive compositions.<br>
However, when a polarizing film manufactured using such a pressure-sensitive adhesive is used for a long time (under a specific thermal and/or humidity condition) in a liquid crystal display, stress tends to concentrate because of the shrinkage of the polarizing film. To solve this problem, the adhesive layer needs to have a stress relaxation ability.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 5,795,650 offered such ability to a pressure-sensitive adhesive by adding a plasticizer to the adhesive layer. However, the light leakage problem could not be solved and it was known that the plasticizer significantly impairs adhesion property of the adhesive because of its surface transfer characteristic. As a result, the adhesive does not solve such durability and reliability problems as bubble and edge lifting.<br>
Japan Patent Publication No. 10-279907 proposed a method of solving the light leakage problem by offering a stress relaxation ability, which was achieved by mixing an acrylic polymer having a high molecular weight with an acrylic polymer having a low molecular weight of 30,000 or less. However, the decrease of the light leakage is slight and the adhesion durability and reliability are reduced significantly because of the surface transfer characteristic. In addition, the cutting property worsens.<br>
It is also possible to control cross linking density with a chemical bonding, in order to offer stress relaxation ability to the adhesive. But, this method is also insufficient to solve stress concentration at the polarizing film. Besides, if the cross linking density is too low, the durability may worsen. There is an alternative of offering fluidity to the adhesive by adding a plasticizer or a material having a low molecular weight. But, the added materials may significantly worsen the adhesive performance because of their surface transfer characteristic.<br>
Thus, the development of a new adhesive for a polarizing film capable of solving the light leakage problem without compromising such major characteristics as<br><br>
adhesion durability and cuttability and a polarizing film using the same are urgently<br>
needed.<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
It is an aspect of the present invention to provide an acrylic pressure-sensitive adhesive composition for a polarizing film capable of solving the light leakage problem without compromising such major characteristics of an adhesive as adhesion durability and cuttability.<br>
It is another aspect of the present invention to provide a polarizing film using the acrylic pressure-sensitive adhesive composition.<br>
It is still another aspect of the present invention to provide a liquid crystal display comprising the polarizing film. Detailed description of the preferred embodiments<br>
In order to attain the aspects, the present invention provides an acrylic pressure-sensitive adhesive composition for a polarizing film comprising<br>
a)	100 parts by weight of an acrylic copolymer prepared from copolymerization of<br>
i) 35-94.9 parts by weight of a (meth) acrylic ester monomer for preparing a<br>
homopolymer having a glass transition temperature ranging from -450C to 10°C;<br>
ii) 5-50 parts by weight of a (meth) acrylic ester monomer for preparing a homopolymer having a glass transition temperature ranging from -90 °C to -50 °C; and<br>
iii) 0.1-15 parts by weight of a vinylic monomer, an acrylic monomer or a mixture thereof having a functional group that can be crosslinked; and<br>
b)	0.01-10 parts by weight of a multifunctional cross linking agent.<br>
The present invention also provides a polarizing film comprising the acrylic pressure-sensitive adhesive composition on one or both sides of a polarizing film as an adhesive layer.<br>
The polarizing film may further comprise at least one layer selected from the group consisting of a protection film, a reflection film, a phase retardation film, a compensation film for wide view angle and a brightness enhancement film.<br>
The present invention also provides a liquid crystal display comprising a liquid crystal panel wherein the polarizing film is attached on one or both sides of a liquid crystal cell.<br><br>
Hereunder is given a detailed description of the present invention.<br>
The present invention relates to an acrylic pressure-sensitive adhesive composition having a superior stress relaxation ability, which comprises an acrylic copolymer copolymerized from monomers for preparing a homopolymer, which have different properties and glass transition temperatures, and a polarizing film prepared using the same.<br>
The present invention is characterized in minimizing light leakage caused by stress concentration, which occurs because of shrinkage or expansion of a polarizing film attached to a liquid crystal display panel after long use, by offering mobility to the polymer chains of an adhesive.<br>
The present invention adjusts the structure of an adhesive. That is, the light leakage problem is solved by controlling the entanglement and flexibility of polymer chains, while maintaining a cross linking density through a chemical bonding. Specifically, the problem of light leakage is solved by minimizing residual stress of the adhesive, while maintaining durability and cuttability, by adequately using a monomer for preparing a homopolymer having a low glass transition temperature (high flexibility) and a monomer for preparing a homopolymer having a high glass transition temperature (low flexibility). In case only a monomer having a low glass transition temperature is used, cohesive force of the adhesive decreases, although the problem of light leakage is solved, thereby causing durability and cuttability problems. Thus, a monomer having a higher glass transition temperature is used together to reinforce cohesive force. In case only a monomer having a high glass transition temperature is used, flexibility is low, although the durability and cuttability problem is solved, thereby causing light leakage problem. Thus, a monomer having a lower glass transition temperature is used together to reinforce flexibility.<br>
The adhesive composition of the present invention may be used for any adhesive or pressure-sensitive adhesive materials, including acrylic, silicone, rubber, urethane, polyester and epoxy adhesives, without limitation. Preferably, it is used for an acrylic adhesive.<br>
The acrylic pressure-sensitive adhesive composition of the present invention comprises a) an acrylic copolymer copolymerized from a (meth) acrylic ester monomer for preparing a homopolymer having a glass transition temperature ranging from -45°C<br><br>
;o 10 C; a (meth)acrylic ester monomer for preparing a homopolymer having a glass ransition temperature ranging from -90°C to - 50°C; and a vinylic monomer, an acrylic &gt;olymer or a mixture thereof having a functional group that can be cross-linked and b) a multifunctional cross linking agent.<br>
Hereunder is given a detailed description of each constituent of the adhesive composition.<br>
The (meth) acrylic ester monomer for preparing a homopolymer having a glass transition temperature ranging from -45°C to 10°C maintains adhesion durability, cuttability, etc. by reinforcing cohesive force. The monomer is used in 35-94.9 parts by weight, preferably in 45-90 parts by weight, per 100 parts by weight of a) the acrylic copolymer. If the content of the monomer exceeds 94.9 parts by weight, the ability to relax residual stress abates. Otherwise, if it is below 35 parts by weight, cohesive force of the adhesive decreases, thereby impairing such properties as adhesion durability and cuttability. For the (meth) acrylic ester monomer having a glass transition temperature ranging from -45°C to 10°C, «-butyl acrylate, isobutyl acrylate, propyl acrylate, ethyl aery late, methyl acrylate, 3 -methylbutyl acrylate, «-hexy1 methacry late, «-octy 1 methacrylate, «-tetradecyl methacrylate, etc. may be used alone or in combination.<br>
The (meth) acrylic ester monomer for preparing a homopolymer having a glass transition temperature ranging from »90°C to -50°C increases flexibility of the polymer chain, thereby offering stress relaxation effect and solving the problem of light leakage. The monomer is used in 5-50 parts by weight, preferably in 10-40 parts by weight, per 100 parts by weight of a) the acrylic copolymer. If the content of the monomer exceeds 50 parts by weight, cohesive force decreases although the residual stress relaxation effect is improved, thereby causing durability and reliability problems. Otherwise, if it is below 5 parts by weight, the residual stress relaxation effect decreases. For the (meth) acrylic ester monomer having a glass transition temperature ranging from -90°C to -50 C, «-octyl acrylate, 2-ethylhexyl acrylate, 2-ethylbutyl acrylate, hexyl acrylate, heptyl acrylate, nonyl acrylate, pentyl acrylate, isooctyl acrylate, «-decyl methacrylate, n-dodecyl methacrylate, etc. may be used alone or in combination.<br>
Of the vinylic monomer, the acrylic monomer or the mixture thereof having a functional group that can be cross linked, the vinylic monomer having a hydroxy group reacts with a cross linking agent to offer cohesive force by chemical bonding, so that the<br><br>
cohesive force of the adhesive does not decrease at high temperature or high humidity. The acrylic monomer having a functional group that can be cross linked, which may be an a, P -unsaturated carboxylic monomer, also offers adhesion strength or cohesive force.<br>
The vinylic monomer, the acrylic monomer or the mixture thereof is preferably comprised in 0.1-15 parts by weight. If the content of the monomer is below 0.1 parts by weight, cohesive force may decrease at high temperature or high humidity. Otherwise, if it exceeds 15 parts by weight, fluidity decreases and cohesive force increases, thereby reducing adhesion strength.<br>
For example, 2-hydroxyethyl (meth) acrylate, 2-hydroxypropyl (meth) acrylate, 2-hydroxyethylene glycol (meth) acrylate, 2-hydroxypropylene glycol (meth) acrylate, etc. may be used for the vinylic monomer. Also, any vinylic monomer having a hydroxy group may be used.    If required, these monomers can be used alone or in combination.<br>
Preferably, the acrylic monomer having a functional group that can be crosslinked is an a, P -unsaturated carboxylic monomer. Non-limiting examples of the a, P -unsaturated carboxylic monomer are acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, acrylic acid dimer, itaconic acid, maleic acid, maleic anhydride, etc. These monomers may be used alone or in combination.<br>
The aforementioned monomers are copolymerized to prepare the acrylic copolymer. Preferably, the acrylic copolymer has a molecular weight ranging from 200,000 to 2,000,000, in consideration of adhesion property, coating ability, etc. Copolymerization of the acrylic copolymer may be performed by solution polymerization, photo polymerization, bulk polymerization, suspension polymerization or emulsion polymerization. Preferably, the acrylic copolymer is prepared by solution polymerization at a polymerization temperature of 50-140°C by adding an initiator to a uniform mixture of the monomers.<br>
b) The cross-linking agent reacts with the carboxylic group and the hydroxy group to increase cohesive force of the adhesive. Preferably, the cross linking agent is comprised in 0.01-10 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of a) the acrylic copolymer. The crosslinking agent may be isocyanate, epoxy, aziridine, metal chelate, etc. Among these, isocyanate is advantageous in use. Examples of the isocyanate cross linking agent are tolylene diisocyanate, xylene diisocyanate, diphenylmetane diisocyanate, hexamethylene   diisocyanate,   isoform  diisocyanate,  tetramethylxylene  diisocyanate,<br><br>
naphthalene diisocyanate and adducts thereof with a polyol like trimethylolpropane. Examples of the epoxy cross linking agent are ethylene glycol diglycidyl ether, triglycidyl ether, trimethylolpropane triglycidyl ether, N,N,Nf,N'-tetraglycidylethylene diamine and glycerine diglycidyl ether. Examples of the aziridine crosslinking agent are N,N!-toluene-2,4-bis(l -aziridine carboxide), N,N'«diphenylmetane-4,4&gt;-bis(l -aziridine carboxide), triethylene melamine, and tri-1-azirdinylphosphine oxide. Examples of the metal chelate cross linking agent are compounds wherein such multivalent metals as aluminum, iron, zinc, tin, titanium, antimony, magnesium and vanadium are coordinated with acetylacetone or ethyl acetoacetate.<br>
The pressure-sensitive adhesive composition of the present invention may be prepared by mixing the acrylic copolymer with the cross linking agent according to the common method.<br>
The multifunctional cross linking agent is required not to be cross linked during formation of the adhesive layer for uniform coating. After the coating process is finished, an elastic, cohesive and strong adhesive layer is obtained passing through drying and aging. Because of the strong cohesive force of the adhesive, such properties as durability, reliability and cuttability are improved.<br>
Considering the physical property balance of the acrylic pressure-sensitive adhesive composition, the adhesive may have a cross linking density of 5-95 %, more preferably 15-80 %. This cross-linking density is the wt% value of the cross linked portion of the acrylic pressure-sensitive adhesive determined by the general gel content measuring method.<br>
The adhesive composition of the present invention may further comprise a silane-coupling agent. The silane-coupling agent improves adhesion stability when attached to a glass plate, thereby improving heat and moisture resistance. In particular, the silane-coupling agent improves adhesion reliability when the adhesive is exposed to high temperature and high humidity for a long time. It may be comprised in 0.005-5 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of the acrylic copolymer. For the silane coupling agent, vinyltrimethoxysilane, vinyltriethoxysilane, y-glycidoxypropyltrimethoxysilane, y-methacryloxypropyltrimethoxysilane, etc. may be used alone or in combination.<br>
The pressure-sensitive adhesive composition of the present invention may further comprise tackifiers in 1-100 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of the<br><br>
acrylic copolymer to control adhesive property. If the tackifiers are used too much, compatibility or cohesive force of the adhesive may worsen, For the tackifiers, a (hydrated) hydrocarbon resin, a (hydrated) rosin resin, a (hydrated) rosin ester resin, a (hydrated) terpene resin, a (hydrated) terpene phenol resin, a polymerized rosin resin, a polymerized rosin ester resin, etc. may be used alone or in combination.<br>
Besides, pressure-sensitive adhesive composition of the present invention may further comprise a plasticizer, an epoxy resin, a hardener, etc. depending on the purpose of use. Further, a UV stabilizer, an antioxidant, a colorant, a modifier, filler, etc. may be added according to the purpose of use.<br>
The present invention also provides a polarizing film comprising the acrylic pressure-sensitive adhesive composition as an adhesive layer.<br>
The polarizing film of the present invention comprises an adhesive layer formed from the pressure-sensitive adhesive composition on one or both sides of the polarizing film.    The polarizing element and the polarizing film are not particularly limited.<br>
Preferably, the polarizing film may be obtained by adding such polarizing ingredients as iodine or dichroic dye to, for example, a polyvinyl alcohol resin. Thickness of the polarizing film is not particularly limited. For the polyvinyl alcohol resin, polyvinyl alcohol, polyvinyl formal, polyvinyl acetal and ethylene, vinyl acetate copolymer, etc. may be used.<br>
On both sides of the polarizing film, a cellulose film of triacetyl cellulose, etc., a polycarbonate film, a polyester film of polyethylene terephthalate, etc., a polyether sulfone film, a polyolefin film of polyethylene, polypropylene, cyclo or norbonene polyolefin, ethylene-propylene copolymer, etc. may be formed to give a multilayer structure.    Thickness of such protecting film is not particularly limited, either.<br>
The Method of forming a pressure-sensitive adhesive layer on the polarizing film is not particularly limited. For example, the pressure-sensitive adhesive may be directly coated on the polarizing film using a bar coater, etc. Alternatively, the adhesive may be coated on a thin substrate and then the pressure-sensitive adhesive layer may be transferred to the surface of the polarizing film after drying, and then aged.<br>
In addition, at least one of a protection layer, a reflection layer, an anti-glare layer, a phase retardation film, compensation film for a wide view angle, a brightness enhancement film, etc. may be formed on the polarizing film of the present invention.<br><br>
The polarizing film in which the pressure-sensitive adhesive of the present invention is used may be used for any common liquid crystal display. Preferably, a liquid crystal display may be manufactured by attaching the polarizing film on one or both sides of a liquid crystal cell.<br>
As described above, the pressure-sensitive adhesive of the present invention composition is advantageous in solving the problem of light leakage by relaxing the stress, which is caused by the shrinkage of the polarizing film, when used for a long time under thermal and/or humidity condition, without compromising major properties such as adhesion durability and cuttability.<br>

The coated polarizing film (200 mm X 200 mm) was attached on both sides of a glass plate (210 mm X 210 mm X 0.7mm) with an angle of 90 °. Light transmission uniformity was evaluated by the following standard.<br>
o : No light leaking was observed by the naked eye.<br>
A : A little non-uniform light transmission was observed.<br>
