				<td>1 Process for the Synthesis of Moxifloxacin Hydrochloride<br>
Technical field:<br>
The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of moxifloxacin, and more 5 particularly relates to a process for the preparation of moxifloxacin which uses a novel Borate intermediate. The present invention relates to a novel crystalline form of    moxifloxacin hydrochloride and process to prepare the same.<br>
Background and prior art:<br>
10 Moxifloxacin hydrochloride {l-cyclopropyl-7-[S, S]-2,8-diazabicyclo-[4,3,0] non-8-yl)6-fluoro-l,4-dihydrp-8-methoxy-4-oxo-3-quinoline carboxylic acid hydrochloride} is known from EP 350733 &amp; EP 550903 and has the following chemical structure.<br><br>
15	Moxifloxacin Hydrochloride<br>
Moxifloxacin is a fluoroquinolone broad spectrum antibacterial agent, shown to be clinically active against Gram-positive microorganisms including staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumonia, and streptococcus pyogenes; significantly better than those of Sparfloxacin and 20 Ciprofloxacin that was disclosed in EP No 350,733 and EP No 550,903. Moxifloxacin also has activity against Gram-negative microorganisms including haemophilus influenzae, haemophilus parainfluenzae, klebisiella pneumoniae, and moraxella catarrhalis.<br>
The prior art disclosed in European patent No's EP 350,733, EP 550,903 and EP 657,448 25 describes the preparation of moxifloxacin hydrochloride involving the condensation of 1-cyclopropyl-6,7-difluoro-8-methoxy-4-oxo-l,4-dUhydro~3-quinoline carboxylic acid or its esters with (S,S) 2,8-diazabicyclo [4.3.0] nonane in presence of a base and its conversion to hydrochloride at higher temperatures leading to the desired moxifloxacin along with its<br><br><br>

potential isomer namely (4aS-Cis)-l-cyclopropyl-6-(238-diazabicyclo[4.3.0]non-8-yl)-7-fluoro-8-me&amp;oxy^-oxo-l,4-dihydro-3-quinoline carboxylic acid as a major impurity. As the impurity and moxifloxacin are positional isomers they are difficult to separate. Further, purification of moxifloxacin to remove this isomer results in lower yields thereby increasing 5  the product cost.<br>
US 5,849,752 discloses the monohydrate of moxifloxacin hydrochloride{l-cyclopropyl-7-([S,S]-2J8-diazabicyclo-[4,3,0]non-8-yl)6-fluoro-l,4-dmydro-8-methoxy-4-oxo-3-quinoIine carboxylic acid hydrochloride} (CDCH) and its preparation by treating the anhydrous 10  crystalline form with ethanol/ water mixtures.<br>
Moxifloxacin hydrochloride exhibits polymorphism. WO 2004/091619 discloses a new crystalims Form IE of moxifloxacin monohydrochoride  ana1 processes for making the crystalline form using an alkanol and an antisolvent for precipitation. This patent discloses X-15 ray powder diffraction patterns, 13C solid state NMR spectra, Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) thermogram and IR spectrum of the crystalline form III.<br>
However, it is known that polymorphic forms of the same drug may have substantial difference in certain pharmaceutically important properties such as dissolution characteristics<br>
20 and bioavailability as well as stability of the drug. Furthermore, different crystalline form may have different particle size, hardness and glass transition temperature. Thus, one crystalline form may provide significant advantages over other crystalline forms of the same drug in solid dosage form manufacture processes, such as accurate measurement of the active ingredients, easier filtration, or improved stability during granulation or storage. Furthermore,<br>
25 a particular process suitable for one crystalline form may also provide drug manufacturers several advantages such as economically or environmentally suitable solvents or processes, or higher purity or yield of the desired product.<br>
US   Patent   No   5,157,117   discloses   (1 -cyclopropyl-637-difluoro-8-methoxy-4-oxo-1,4-30  dihydro-3-quinoline carboxylic acid- 03,04)bis (acyloxy-0)bonate and a process for its preparation by reacting ethyl-l-cycIopropyl-6,7-difluror-8-methoxy-4-oxo-l,4-dihydro-3-<br><br><br>

WO 2005/012285 discloses the process for the preparation of moxifloxacin hydrochloride 5 using a novel intermediate namely (4aS-Cis)-(l-cyclopropyl-7-(2,8-diazabicyclo [4,3,0]non-8-yl)-6-fluoro-8-methoxy-4-oxo-l,4-dihydro-3-quinoline carboxylic acid - 0,0) bis(acycloxy-0)borate. The disclosure further refers to the preparation of moxifloxacin hydrochloride pseudohydrate and conversion to moxifloxacin hydrochloride monohydrate. The fingerprinting of the novel intermediate, moxifloxacin hydrochloride pseudohydrate and 10 moxifloxacin hydrochloride anhydrous and moxifloxacin hydrochloride monohydrate forms are substantiated using NMR, FTIR and X-ray diffraction analysis.<br>
Prior art processes for the preparation of the Borate complex without use of catalyst has its limitations owing to higher exothermicity during acetylation thereby reducing the reaction 15 purity which is indicated in the lower yields obtained when further converted to moxifloxacin after condensation with nonane and subsequent hydrolysis. Also prior art makes use of triethyl amine as a base required for the condensation step with nonane.<br>
Hence it is a long felt need of the industry to provide a simple, safe and cost effective process 20 that produces moxifloxacin hydrochloride with high product yield and quality.<br>

Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
The present invention provides an improved process for the preparation of moxifloxacin base, or a salt thereof, especially the hydrochloride salt, using a novel intermediate ( I) and 5  (ID-<br><br>
10 In one embodiment of the present invention the process comprises first reacting boric acid and propionic anhydride with ethyl l-cyclopropyl-6,7-difiuoro-8-methoxy-4-oxo-U4-dihydro-3-quinolinecarboxylate (A) without using any catalyst to give a novel borate complex of formula (I), l-cyclopropyl-6,7-difluro-S-memoxy-4K-oxo-l,4-dihydro-3-qumoline carboxylic acid-03,04) bis (propyloxy-O) borate.<br>

In another embodiment of the present invention the novel borate complex (I) may be 5  condensed with (S,S)-2,8-Diazabicyclo [4.3.0] nonane (B) in absence of any base using an organic polar solvent to give novel intermediate of formula (H).<br><br>
The intermediate (II) may be subjected to hydrolysis to get moxifloxacin base. The base may 15  be treated with hydrochloric acid in the presence of a suitable solvent to give moxifloxacin hydrochloride.<br>

PCT/GB2007/004320<br><br><br>
Surprisingly, it was found that use of propionic anhydride without the use of any catalyst 5 during the preparation of Borate complex follows a nonexothermic pathway resulting in lesser impurity formation and hence better recovery of the product. Also reaction of the propionate complex with the nonane (B) without the use of a base results in moxifloxacin with excellent yields. In general, we prefer that a base is used if the temperature of the reaction is less than or equal to about 100°C. We prefer that a base is used if the temperature 10 of the reaction is above 100°C.<br>
The process of present invention wherein the novel borate complex (I) is condensed with (S,S)-2,8-Diazabicyclo [4.3.0] nonane   (B) can be optionally carried out in using sodium raethoxide , triethyl amine as base in an organic polar solvent to give novel intermediate of 15  formula (II).<br>
The yield of moxifloxacin hydrochloride is much higher compared with the yields from prior art processes: 100.0 g of nonane yields 260.0 g of moxifloxacin hydrochloride using the process of the present invention whereas; 100.0 g of nonane yields 187.0 g of moxifloxacin 20  hydrochloride as per prior art process.<br>
In yet another aspect the present invention provides a novel crystalline form of moxifloxacin hydrochloride herein designated Form C, and a process for the preparation of Form C which comprises the step of: dissolving or suspending the moxifloxacin base in 25 methanol treating with methanolic hydrochloric acid, preferably at a temperature range of 0° C to 30°C, and isolating moxifloxacin hydrochloride form C from methanol.<br>
2 5 MAY 2009<br><br>
WO 2008/059223<br><br>
PCTyGB2007/004320<br><br>
It is preferred that the methanol is substantially pure, i.e., it has a water content less than o.5 wt%.<br>
It is preferred that the methanolic hydrochloride comprises 10-15% HC1 gas dissolved in 5 methanol.<br>
The moxifloxacin base may be formed according to the processes  described above, specifically:<br>
10        i)        Reacting Propionic anhydride and boric acid with Ethyl- l-cyclopropyl-6-7-<br>
difluoro-8- methoxy-4-oxo-l, 4-dihydro-3-quinolone carboxylate (A) to obtain 1-<br>
cy clopropyl-6,7-difluoro-8 -methoxy-4-oxo-1,4-dihy dro-3 -quinoline     carboxylic<br>
acid-O , O bis(propyloxy-0)borate (I);<br>
ii)        Condensing the borate complex (I) with nonane (B) in the absence of a base and<br>
15	in an organic solvent to obtain a novel intermediate (4aS-Cis)-(l-cyclopropyl-7-<br>
(2,8-diazabicyclo	[4.3.0]non-8-yl)-6-fluoro-8-methoxy-4-oxo-l)4-dihydro-3-<br>
quinoline carboxylic acid-O3,04) bis(propyloxy-0)borate (II); and iii)       hydrolysing the intermediate (II) to get moxifloxacin base<br>
20 Moxifloxacin Hydrochloride Form C according to the present invention is further characterized by X-ray powder diffraction spectrum as obtained by X-ray powder diffraction spectrum measured on a Rigaku D-maz-2200 advance X-ray powder diffractometer having a copper-k-a radiation as shown in Figure 1.<br>
