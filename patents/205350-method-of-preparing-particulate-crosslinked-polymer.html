METHOD OF PREPARING PARTICULATE CROSSLINKED POLYMER<br>
PPG INDUSTRIES OHIO,  INC.  of  3800 WEST 143RD STREET, CLEVELAND, OH 44111, U.S.A. AMERICAN Company<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed : -<br><br><br><br><br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a method of preparing particulate crosslinked polymer. In particular, the present invention relates to a method of preparing particulate polymer in which an organic phase is suspended as droplets, in a liquid suspension medium, followed by polymerizing the suspension of droplets to form the particulate crosslinked polymer.  More particularly, the organic phase is composed of (i) a first component comprising, a polyisocyanate and/or a polyepoxide, and optionally a capped polyisocyanate; and (ii) a second component comprising a polyamine.<br>
Particulate crosslinked polymers are useful in a number of applications, such as additives for paints, adhesives and cosmetic products, as carriers for drugs, and agricultural chemicals, and as spacers for stacked assemblies, e.g., liquid crystal displays. Particulate crosslinked polymers, such as particulate crosslinked polyepoxides and polyurethane-ureas, are also useful in polishing pads, which are used to polish and/or planarize various substrates. Polishing pads may be prepared from a mixture of particulate  crosslinked polymer and a crosslinkable organic binder, which is typically cured under pressure in a mold. During the manufacture of computer chips, for example, various substrates, such as. silicon wafers, are polished and/or planarized to narrow engineering tolerances with polishing pads.  The polishing pads used to polish computer chip substrates, and in particular the materials from which the pads are prepared, such as particulate crosslinked polymers, must also typically conform to a set of narrowly controlled physical properties, e.g., particle size, particle size distribution, particle shape and crosslink density.<br><br><br>
15:27<br><br><br><br>
It is known that polyurethane-urea particles can be prepared by what is commonly referred to as an interfacial polymerisation method, in the interfacial polymerization method an isocyanate functional material is dispersed in water, followed by the addition of a polyamine to the dispersion, which results in the formation of polyurethane-urea particles. . If the polyurethane-urea particles are isolated after completion of the interfacial polymerization, e.g., by filtration, the aqueous phase typically contains polyamine, which requires additional treatment steps prior to disposal.<br>
It is desirable to develop methods of preparing particulate crosslinked polymers, such as particulate crosslinked polyurethane-ureas and polyepoxides.  It is also desirable to develop methods of preparing particulate crosslinked polymers that minimize the formation of waste streams, such as aqueous streams containing polyamines.<br>
United States Patent No. 5,041,467 describes a method of producing particulate polymers, in which a mixture of an isocyanate compound containing two or more isocyanate groups per molecule and a surfactant containing two or more hydroxyl groups per molecule is emulsified and allowed to cure in a dispersing medium, which does not dissolve the isocyanate compound.  The method of the '467 patent is described as being performed in the absence of a protective colloid.<br>
United States Patent No. S,292,829 describes a method of preparing crosslinked polyurethane polyurea spherically particulate polymer, which involves reacting an isocyanurate ring-containing polyisocyanate compound with a polyhydroxy compound to form an organic phase, dispersing the organic phase into water, and adding a polyamine to the dispersion. The 829 patent describes the occurrence of an interfacial polymerization between the dispersed organic phase<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION As used herein and in the claims, the term "particulate crosslinks polymer" refers to particulate polymers that have a three-dimensional crosslink network and that do not have a melting or sintering point. Accordingly, the particulate crosslinked polymers of the present invention do not become sintered together upon heating. The shape of. the particulate crosslinked polymer prepared according to the method of the present invention may be regular and/or irregular, and may be selected from shapes including, for example, spherical, disk, flake and combinations and/or mixtures thereof.  Typically, the particulate crosslinked ' polymer is substantially spherical in shape.<br>
The particulate crosslinked polymer of the present . invention may have a wide range of particle sizes, e.g., from colloidal to bead size Typically, the particle size of the  particulate crosslinked polymer is at least 20 microns, preferably at least 50 microns, and more preferably at least 100 microns The particulate crosslinked polymer typically has an average particle size of less than 2 millimeters (mm), more typically less than 500 microns, preferably less than 400 microns, and more preferably less than 300 microns. The average particle size of the particulate crosslinked polymer may range between any combination of these upper and lower values, inclusive of the recited values. The average particle size of the particulate crosslinked polymer may' be determined by methods that are well known to the skilled artisan, e.g., using analytical instrumentation, such as a Coulter LS particle size analyzer.<br>
The particulate crosslinked polymer may be porous or substantially solid. By "substantially solid" is meant that the particulate polymer is not hollow, e.g., it is not in the form hollow microcapsules.<br><br><br><br><br>
!-10-2003 15:29<br><br><br>
Particulate crosslinked polymers that may be prepared according to the method of the present invention are, particulate crosslinked palyurethane-urea polymers, particulate crosslinked polyepoxides, and particulate    crosslinked polyurethane-urea-epoxide polymers.  Particulate crosslinked polyurethane-urea polymers prepared in the method of the present invention, have backbone linkages selected from urethane linkages (-NH-C(O)-O-), urea linkages (-NH-C(O)-NH-and/or -NH-C{O)-N(R)- wherein R is hydrogen, an aliphatic, cycloaliphatic or aromatic group), and combinations thereof. Particulate crosslinked polyepoxides, prepared in accordance with the method of the present invention, have backbone linkages selected from ether linkages, amino linkages and combinations thereof  In an embodiment of the present invention, the first component of the organic phase comprises a mixture of polyisocyanate and polyepoxide, and the resulting particulate crosslinked polymer is a particulate crosslinked polyurethane-urea-epoxide polymer. As used herein, "particulate crosslinked polyurethane-urea-epoxide polymers"     have backbone linkages selected from combinations of urethane linkages, urea linkages, ether linkages and amino linkages.<br>
In the method of the present invention, an organic<br><br>
phase comprising first and second components is initially prepared. As the first and second components typically begin to react, i.e., form covalent bonds, with each other upon their combination, the organic phase typically has a limited pot-life and will gel if allowed to stand too long prior to formation of the suspension in step (b) .  While gel formation can be delayed by cooling the organic phase, e.g., to a     temperature below 25°C, the organic phase is typically<br>
prepared at least at ambient room temperature, e.g., 25°C, and soon or immediately thereafter the suspension formation step (b) is performed. The organic phase may be prepared by meana<br><br><br><br>

of batch methods, for example, by mixing the first and second components together with an impeller. Alternatively, the organic phase may be prepared continuously, for example, by combining continuously separate feed streams of the first and   second components in a mixing head and expelling continuously the organic phase from the mixing head.<br>
The polyisocyanate of the first reactant of the organic phase has at least two isocyanate (-NCO) groups, e.g., from 2 to 10 isocyanate groups. Typically the polyisocyanate has from 2 co 4 isocyanate groups.' The polyisocyanate may be selected,from aliphatic polyisocyanate monomers, aromatic polyisocyanate monomers, polyurethane prepolymers having at least two isocyanate groups and mixtures thereof. As used herein and in the claims, the term "aliphatic polyisocyanate monomers" refers to saturated polyisocyanate monomers, ethylenically unsaturated polyisocyanate monomers, alicyclic    polyisocyanate monomers and mixtures of two or more classes thereof Aliphatic polyisocyanate monomers that are useful in the method of the present invention, typically contain at    least 4 carbon atoms, e.g., from 4 to 20 carbon atoms. As used herein and in the claims, the term "aromatic polyisocyanate monomers" refers to aromatic polyisocyanate monomers wherein the isocyanate groups are not bonded directly to the aromatic ring, e.g., α,α'-xylene diisocyanate; aromatic polyisocyanate monomers wherein the isocyanate groups are bonded directly to the aromatic ring, e.g., benzene diisocyanate; and mixtures thereof. Aromatic polyisocyanate monomers that are useful in the method of the present invention, typically contain at least 8 carbon atoms,    e.g., from 8 to 20 carbon atoms.<br>

polyisocyanate may be fugitive or nonfugitive.  By<br>
"nonfugitive capping groups" is meant a capping group, which<br>
upon de-capping or de-blocking from the isocyanate group,<br>
remains substantially within the three dimensional crosslink<br>
   network or matrix of the particulate polymer. By "fugitive<br>
capping group" is meant a capping group, which upon de-capping<br>
or de-blocking from the isocyanate group, migrates<br>
substantially out of the three dimensional crosslink network<br>
or matrix of, the particulate polymer.<br>
Capped polyisocyanates are typically characterized<br>
as having a de-capping temperature. As used herein and in the<br>
claims, the term "de-capping temperature" refers to the<br>
minimum,      <br>
the capped polyisocyanate are converted to decapped, i.e.,<br>
   free, isocyanate groups and separate or free capping groups.<br>
The de-capping temperature of many capped polyisocyanates is<br>
typically between 121°C (250°F) and 19l°C (375°F).<br>

 	In a further embodiment of the present invention,<br>
the organic phase may optionally further comprise an organic solvent.  The organic solvent is typically used to reduce the viscosity of the organic phase, so that it may be more controllably introduced into the liquid suspension medium in<br>
    the suspension formation step of the present invention.  The solvent is preferably inert, i.e., being nonreactive with isocyanate groups, epoxide groups, capped isocyanate groups and active hydrogen groups  Alternatively, the solvent may contain one or more active hydrogen groups, e.g., hydroxy1 groups, and be' reactive with the polyisocyanate or   poly epoxide, in which case the solvent is a reactive diluent.

In the method of the present invention, the organic phase is suspended as droplets in a liquid suspension medium.<br>
    The organic phase is substantially insoluble in the liquid suspension medium, wnich is selected from organic suspension mediums, e.g., an organic solvent, and aqueous suspension mediums, e.g., deionized water. Organic solvents that may be<br><br>

used as in organic ouspension medium include those that are<br>
inert to isocyanate and epoxide groups, for example, paraffin,<br>
esters, ketones, aromatic hydrocarbons, halogen compounds,<br>
ethers and mixtures thereof.<br>
 	Preferably, the liquid suspension medium is an<br>
aqueous suspension medium, while the aqueous suspension medium may contain organic materials, e.g., alcohols, ethers and organic surfactants, it typically contains a major amount of water  The aqueous suspension medium typically contains 10 water in an amount of at least 51 percent by weight, based on the total weight of the aqueous suspension medium, e.g., from 51 percent to 99  percent by weight, based on the total weight of the aqueous suspension medium.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, the    liquid suspension medium is substantially free of polyamines, e.g., containing less than 0.l percent by weight of polyamine, based on the total weight of the liquid suspension medium. Ensuring that the liquid suspension medium is substantially free of polyamines, can be achieved by. (a) selecting a liquid suspension medium in which the organic phase (including the polyamine of the second component) is substantially insoluble,  and (b) not adding any polyamines to the liquid suspension medium.<br>
The organic phase may be suspended as droplets in the liquid suspension medium by means that are well known to those of ordinary skill in the art. Typically, the organic phase is poured slowly into the liquid suspension medium, while the liquid suspension medium is agitated, e.g., by means of a high speed impeller. After completion of the addition of the organic phase to the liquid suspension medium, the suspension is typically stirred under high agitation for a period of time sufficient to result in a desired particle size (as is typically determined by trial and error) , followed by<br><br>

less. agitated stirring to keep the suspension of organic droplets from settling out of the liquid suspension medium. Polymerizing the suspension of droplets of organic phase in the liquid suspension medium is typically achieved by S heating the suspension to a temperature that is above room temperature but less than the boiling point of the liquid Suspension medium, e.g., 100°c in the case of water under atmospheric pressure. While the suspension may be heated at pressures above or below atmospheric pressure, it is typically<br>
10 heated under conditions of atmospheric pressure (e.g., 760 Torr).. Generally, the suspension is heated under atmospheric pressure with continuous agitation to a temperature from 30°C to 5S°C or from 50°c to 85°C, The suspension is typically stirred continuously at elevated temperature for a time<br>
    sufficient to result in complete polymerization of the<br>
suspended organic droplets, e.g., from 10 minutes to 8 hours, and formation of particulate crosslinked polymer.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, the first component of the organic phase contains a capped<br>
          polyisocyanate, and the polymerization of the suspension of   droplets of the organic phase in the liquid suspension medium  in step (c) is performed at a temperature that is less than the de-capping temperature of the capped polyisocyanate. For example, if the de-capping temperature of the capped polyisocyanate is 121°C (250aF), the polymerization step is preferably performed at a temperature of less than 121°C, e.g., from 30°c to 3s°c.  Polymerizing the suspension of droplets at a temperature that is less than the de-capping temperature of the capped polyisocyanate allows for the      formation of particulate crosslinked polymer that contains capped isocyanate groups. The capped isooyanate groups within the particulate crosslinked polymer can be later decapped and<br><br>

reacted by heating the particulate polymer above the de-capping temperature, as described previously herein.<br>
Upon completion of the polymerization step, the suspension of particulate crosslinked polymer is typically s cooled to room temperature, e.g., 25°C, and may be stored in a suitable container Cor later use  While the particulate crosslinked polymer may be stored in the liquid suspension medium, it is typically isolated from the liquid suspension medium. Isolation of the particulate crosslinked polymer may<br>
10 be achieved by methods that are well known in the art.  For example, the particulate crosslinked polymer may be allowed to settle put of the liquid suspension medium, followed by pouring the liquid suspension medium off of the settled particulate crosslinked polymer, More typically, the<br>
     particulate crosslinked polymer is isolated by means of<br>
filtration, which is further typically followed by drying of the isolated particulate polymer.<br>

Charge 1 was added to an open container and placed on a hot plate set at a temperature of 90°C until the contents of the container became molten.  Charge 2 was then added to the container while still on the hot plate, and the contents were thoroughly mixed with a motor driven impeller until uniform.  The contents of the container were then poured slowly into 400 grams of 80oC deionized water, with concurrently vigorous stirring of the deioni2ed water.  Upon completion of the addition of the contents of the container, vigorous mixing of the deionized water was continued for an<br><br>
- 31 -<br>
additional 10 minutes, followed by isolation of the formed<br>
particulate crosslinked polyurethane by means of filtration.<br>
The isolated particulate crosslinked polyurethane was dried in<br>
a 130°C oven for 2 hours.<br>
The dried particulate material was classified using<br>
a stack of sieves having mesh sizes from the top to the bottom<br>
of the stack of: 40 mesh (420 micron sieve openings), SO mesh<br>
,(297 micron sieve openings), 70 mesh (210 micron sieve<br>
openings) , 140 mesh (105 micron sieve openings) and 325 mesh<br>
(44 micron sieve openings) . Particulate material was<br>
collected separately from each of the sieve screens and<br>
weighed. The weights of the particulate material collected .<br>
from each of the sieve screens was used to calculate the<br>
particle size distribution of the particulate crosslinked<br>
polyurethane, which is summarized in Table 1. Particulate<br>
material collected from, for example, the 70 mesh screen was<br>
determined to have a particle size range of from about 210 to<br>
297 microns, based on the sieve opening sizes of the SO and 70 <br>

Charge I was added to an open container and stirred with a motor driven impeller at ambient room temperature (about 25°C)  until all of the components were visually observed to have dissolved and a uniform mixture was formed. Charge 2 was then, added to the container, and the contents were further mixed until uniform. The contents of the container were then poured slowly into 300 grams of 80°C deioniaed water, with concurrently vigorous stirring of the deionized water.  Upon completion of the addition of the contents of the container, vigorous mixing of the deionized water was continued for an additional 2 hours, followed by isolation of the formed particulate crosslinked polyepoxide by means of filtration.  The isolated particulate crosslinked polyepoxide was dried overnight in a 100oC oven.<br>
The dried particulate crosslinked polyepoxide was classified using a stack of sieves as described in Example A. Particulate crosslinked polyepoxide was collected separately<br><br>
