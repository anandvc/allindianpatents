FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to bi-directional communications devices such as modems,<br>
particularly, to a modem providing timing error processing functions adapted to<br>
application interface timing anomalies. More particularly, the invention relates to<br>
a method and an apparatus for adapting a second transport stream included<br>
within a first transport stream and reducing timing anomaly imparted to the<br>
second transport stream within the context of a front-end device subject to<br>
random access via a data bus, illustratively a PCI bus.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Modems are currently utilized as discrete computer peripherals that interface a<br>
host device such as a personal computer (PC), with an external broadband<br>
gateway or access network such as provided by a cable television or telecom<br>
company. A modem may be considered a "front-end" device, which retrieves<br>
information from the access network and provides the information to a "back-<br>
end" device, such as a PC. In a typical configuration, a modem such as a digital<br>
subscriber line (DSL) or cable modem interfaces to a PC via a peripheral<br>
component interconnect (PCI) slot associated with the PC.<br><br><br>
The PCI slot is typically one of many PCI slots or interface connections sharing a<br>
common PCI bus architecture. Thus, access of one device communicating via the<br>
PCI bus results in at least a brief servicing of a PCI bus interrupt or other<br>
command by each of the other devices communicating via the PCI bus. This brief<br>
servicing requirement tends to produce "jitter" or other timing anomalies, which<br>
may be deleterious to the routing of time sensitive data.<br>
In the case of MPEG audiovisual data, excessive network jitter, or the improper<br>
recovery of the 27 MHz clock associated with an MPEG transport stream can<br>
cause buffer overflow, buffer underflow, undesirable color changes and other<br>
deleterious phenomenon which result in improper presentation of the audiovisual<br>
material being conveyed. Such network jitter or improper clock recovery (or<br>
other timing operations) may be caused by PCI bus access/servicing.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
In a first aspect of the invention, there is provided an apparatus for adapting a<br>
second transport stream included within a first transport stream, comprising a<br>
modem, for receiving from a first medium a first transport stream having<br>
disposed therein packets associated with a second transport stream, said second<br>
transport stream packets being susceptible to timing errors; a data control<br><br><br>
module, for adapting said second transport stream packets in a manner tending<br>
to reduce said timing errors, said data control module utilizing timing information<br>
recovered from at least one of said first transport stream and said second<br>
transport stream; and a transport interface, for providing said packets associated<br>
with said second transport stream to a back-end device having a peripheral<br>
component interconnect (PCI) interface via a second non-PCI transport medium<br>
so as to bypass the PCI interface of the back-end device.<br>
In a second aspect of the invention, there is provided a method, for adapting a<br>
second transport stream included within a first transport stream, the method<br>
comprising the steps of receiving, from a first medium, a first transport stream<br>
having disposed therein packets associated with a second transport stream, said<br>
first medium tending to impart jitter to said first transport stream; extracting,<br>
from said first transport stream, those packets associated with said second<br>
transport stream; adapting using timing information derived from at least one of<br>
said first and second transport streams said extracted packets in a manner<br>
tending to reduce said jitter; and transmitting said translated extracted packets,<br>
to a back-end device having a peripheral component interconnect (PCI)<br>
interface, via a second non-PCI medium so as to bypass the PCI interface in the<br>
back-end device.<br><br><br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
The teachings of the present invention can be readily understood by considering<br>
the following detailed description in conjunction with the accompanying<br>
drawings, in which:<br>
Fig. 1 depicts a high-level block diagram of a system benefiting from the present<br>
invention; and<br>
Fig. 2 depicts a flow diagram of a processing method according to an<br>
embodiment of the invention.<br>
To facilitate understanding, identical reference numerals have been used, where<br>
possible, to designate identical elements that are common to the figures.<br>
Detailed Description of the Preferred Embodiments<br>
The invention will be described within the context of a front-end device<br>
comprising a digital subscriber line (DSL) modem, which interfaces to a back end<br>
device comprising a computing device such as a personal computer (PC) or set<br>
top terminal (STT). Data received from a network via the front-end device is<br>
typically coupled to a PCI interface for subsequent processing by the back-end<br>
device. The invention instead routes data directly to the back-end device for<br><br>
subsequent processing. Clock recovery and buffer management of, illustratively,<br>
a received asynchronous MPEG data stream may be performed in the front-end<br>
device by a data control/jitter processor such that back-end MPEG decoder<br>
functions do not need to include such functions. In this manner, a direct memory<br>
access (DMA) transfer of received MPEG data using the PCI interface is avoided,<br>
thereby reducing the amount of PCI bus access necessary to effect data transfer<br>
from the front-end device to the back-end device.<br><br>
FIG. 1 depicts a high-level block diagram of a system benefiting from the<br>
present invention. Specifically, FIG. 1 depicts a high-level block diagram of a<br>
system 100 comprising a first medium such as an access network 101 in<br>
communication with a "front-end" device 102. The front-end device 102<br>
communicates with a "back-end" device 104 via a second medium 103. It is<br>
noted that the second medium 103 tends to impart little or no timing errors or<br>
data degradation to a data stream transmitted therethrough in comparison to<br>
the first medium 101. The front-end 102 also communicates with a computing<br>
device (not shown) via a known interface, such as a peripheral component<br>
interconnect (PCI) interface, universal serial bus (USB) interface, small<br>
computer serial interface (SCSI) interface or the like. The back-end 104<br>
communicates with an application 105 via an application interface 170.<br>
In an exemplary embodiment, a transport stream according to a first<br>
transport format (such as asynchronous transfer mode (ATM), Internet protocol<br>
(IP) or other known transport protocol) is received by the front-end device 102<br>
from the access network 101. In the case of the access network 101<br>
comprising a telecommunications network, the front-end device 102<br>
implements a telecommunications interface function, such as digital subscriber<br>
line (DSL) or other suitable interface function. If the access network 101<br>
comprises a digital cable television distribution network, then the front-end 102<br>
implements a cable modem interface function. Other access network/front-end<br>
combinations, e.g., satellite, POTS, etc., are readily known to those skilled in<br>
the art. Fig. 1 is primarily described within the context of a DSL-compliant<br>
access network.<br>
The front-end device 102 comprises an xDSL modem 110, a router 115,<br>
a data control/de-jitter module 120, a transport interface 125, a processor 130,<br>
memory 135 and a PCI interface 140. The front-end device 102<br>
advantageously processes timing information associated with one or both of the<br>
received transport stream and the transport stream to be provided to the back-<br>
end device 104. These timing parameters are used to determine timing<br>
anomalies and the front-end device corrects such anomalies to the extent<br>
possible prior to transmission of recovered data via the medium 103 to the<br>
back-end device 104.<br><br>
The xDSL modem 110 interfaces with the access network 101 to<br>
transmit and receive data arranged according to a transport format suitable for<br>
use in the access network 101. The xDSL modem 110 routes data to and from<br>
the data control/de-jitter module 120 via router 115. The xDSL modem 110 and<br>
router 115 communicate with the processor 130, illustratively a reduced<br>
instruction set computer (RISC) processor. The processor 130 coordinates the<br>
functions of the xDSL modem 110 and router 115. The processor 130<br>
cooperates with memory 135, which is used to store instructions and serve as<br>
temporary storage and/or buffer memory for the front-end 102.<br>
The processor 130 also cooperates with various support circuitry (not<br>
shown), such as cache memory, clock circuits, power circuits and the like.<br>
The router 115 operates to extract transport packets adapted to<br>
subsequent processing via the back-end 104 from the data received from the<br>
access network 101. In the case of the access network 101 transporting<br>
packets using a format appropriate to the back-end processor 104, the router<br>
115 simply routes the appropriate packets to the data control/de-jitter module<br>
120. In the case of the access network 101 transporting packets using a format<br>
different than utilized by the back-end processor 104, the router 115 operates<br>
to extract from the access network packet structure information according to the<br>
packet structure compatible with the back-end processor 104.<br>
The data control/de-jitter module 120 processes timing parameters<br>
associated with the extracted packets and, optionally, timing parameters<br>
associated with the transport packets received from the access network 101.<br>
The timing parameters processed include, for example, clock recovery<br>
parameters such as those associated with the recovery of a 27 MHz MPEG<br>
system clock. In one embodiment of the invention, the second transport stream<br>
comprises an MPEG transport stream having inserted therein reference<br>
packets comprising portions of the 27 MHz MPEG system clock. That is, each<br>
reference packet includes a program clock reference (PCR) used to<br>
synchronize a recovery clock such that recovery of the MPEG transport packets<br>
and various system synchronization functions may be performed. Having<br>
recovered the 27 MHz MPEG system clock, additional timing parameters may<br>
be processed, such as presentation time stamp (PTS), decode time stamp<br>
(DTS) and other parameters.<br><br>
The PCR-derived recovery clock (and, optionally, other timing<br>
parameters) is used by the data control/de-jitter module 120 to determine<br>
whether recovered packets have been subjected to timing anomalies such as<br>
dropped packets, delayed packets, jitter and other anomalies. Such anomalies<br>
may be caused by the access network 101, other networks (not shown)<br>
connected to the access network 101 and used to transport the data, and<br>
interruptions of the front end device 102 via computing device demands placed<br>
upon the PCI interface 140. In response to this determination, appropriate data<br>
and such or timing processing operations are performed. For example,<br>
transport packets may be "restamped" such that timing anomalies are removed<br>
from a contiguous sequence of transport packets. In the case of dropped,<br>
missing or otherwise corrupted transport packets, such packets may be<br>
replaced by new packets (using forward error correction techniques, for<br>
example). Corrupted packets may be suppressed to avoid timing or decoder<br>
errors in the back-end device. Generally speaking, data control/de-jitter module<br>
120 is used to correct the timing parameters associated with the included or<br>
back-end packet structure. The corrected packets are coupled to the transport<br>
interface 125, which performs all necessary transport interface functions<br>
enabling the transport of the data to back-end processor 104 via medium 103.<br>
The data control/de-jitter module 120 also cooperates with the PCI<br>
interface 140 to communicate with a computing device (not shown) such as a<br>
personal computer (PC) or other computing device. The computing device<br>
provides information to the data control/de-jitter module 120 useful in<br>
determining which timing parameters are to be processed, which formats are<br>
utilized by the access network 101 and back-end device 104, and other<br>
information. The PCI interface 140 may be replaced by a universal serial bus<br>
(USB) interface device, small computer serial interface (SCSI) or other known<br>
interface device. It is noted that timing anomalies may occur due to PCI, USB<br>
or SCSI interface servicing demands placed upon the front-end device.<br>
The back-end device 104 illustratively comprises a transport interface<br>
150, a transport processor 155, a video decoder 160, an audio decoder 165,<br>
and an optional application interface module 170. The back-end device 104<br>
receives from the second medium 103, illustratively, a transport stream<br>
comprising audiovisual information such as an MPEG transport stream. The<br><br>
transport interface 150 performs known transport interface functions upon the<br>
received transport stream and couples the received transport stream to the<br>
transport processor 155. The transport processor 155 performs known<br>
transport processing functions such as demultiplexing a particular one transport<br>
stream from a signal comprising a plurality of transport streams, demultiplexing<br>
video and audio elementary streams from the selected transport stream and<br>
coupling the resulting video V and audio A packetized or non-packetized<br>
elementary streams to, respectively, video decoder 160 and audio decoder 165.<br>
Each of the video decoders 160 and audio decoders 165 operate to<br>
decode, respectively, video stream V and audio stream A to produce resulting<br>
decoded video and audio streams. The decoded video and audio streams are<br>
coupled to a signal processor and, subsequently, respective presentation<br>
devices (not shown). The optional interface 170 cooperates with an application<br>
105 and, specifically, an application processor 175. The application processor<br>
175 is associated with memory 180 running the application.<br>
In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, the back-end device 104<br>
utilizes a first RISC processor to implement the transport interface 150 and<br>
transport processor 155 functions. Additionally, each of the video decoder 160<br>
and audio decoder functions is implemented by a respective RISC processor.<br>
In the exemplary embodiment, the interface 170 comprises a RISC interface,<br>
which cooperates with the application processor 175, illustratively an<br>
application RISC. The memory 180 is used by the application RISC 175 and,<br>
optionally, one or more of the video decoder RISCs 160, audio decoder RISCs<br>
165 and transport RISC 150-155.<br>
The above-described apparatus, in accordance with the principles of the<br>
invention and utilizing the various previously described RISC processors,<br>
provides an architecture that scales very well for increased data rates.<br>
Specifically, while a back-end RISC engine will eventually run out of processing<br>
power to route data if the back-end engine also performs timing functions, the<br>
apparatus of the present invention does not. This is because the front-end of<br>
the present invention performs the timing functions that otherwise limit the data<br>
rate that the back end device 104 is capable of sustaining.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, a set top terminal implementing<br>
DSL functionality does not function as a gateway device. In this embodiment of<br><br>
the invention, the front-end device 102 may be simplified by deleting<br>
router/switch mechanism and the PCI interface. That is, where the front-end<br>
device does not need to communicate with a computing device, the PCI<br>
interface 140 and router 115 may be avoided.<br>
A computing device capable of implementing methods according to the<br>
present invention is formed using the various processors implementing the<br>
front-end device 102 and back-end device 104, as well as corresponding<br>
memory devices and input/output devices. As such, it is contemplated that<br>
some of the process steps discussed herein as software processes may be<br>
implemented within hardware, for example, as circuitry that cooperates with the<br>
above-referenced processors, input/output (I/O) devices such as the above-<br>
referenced interface devices, and the various memory devices. It will be noted<br>
that some of the process implementations discussed herein are discussed<br>
herein in terms of a general-purpose computer that is programmed to perform<br>
various clock recovery, data recovery, clock and data processing and other<br>
functions in accordance with the present invention. It will be noted that the<br>
invention may be implemented in hardware as, for example, an application<br>
specific integrated circuit (ASIC), such as a modem integrated circuit (IC)<br>
implementing the front-end device 102 and/or the back-end device 104. As<br>
such, the process steps described herein are intended to be broadly interpreted<br>
as being equivalent^ performed by software, hardware, or a combination<br>
thereof.<br>
FIG. 2 depicts a flow diagram of a processing method according to an<br>
embodiment of the invention. Specifically, the processing method 200 of FIG. 2<br>
is entered at step 205 where first transport stream packets are received by the<br>
front end device 102 from a first medium, illustratively an access network 101,<br>
such as an illustrative telecommunications network.<br>
At step 210, second transport stream packets are extracted from the first<br>
transport stream. That is, while the first transport stream is being received,<br>
those packets within the first transport stream associated with an included<br>
second transport stream are extracted.<br>
At step 220, timing parameters associated with the first transport stream<br>
packets and/or second transport stream packets are processed to determine<br>
whether any timing errors exist. That is, referring to box 225, the timing<br><br>
parameters from one or both of the first and/or second transport streams are<br>
processed to identify packet jitter, dropped packets, packet corruption and other<br>
timing errors.<br>
As previously noted, other timing errors may comprise those errors due<br>
to the servicing of the PCI interface 140 (or corresponding USB, SCSI or other<br>
interface).<br>
At step 230, timing errors within the second transport stream packets are<br>
corrected to the extent possible. For example, in the case of packet jitter or<br>
other timing errors, anti-jitter processing techniques are utilized to correct the<br>
determined packet jitter errors. In this manner, the packets associated with the<br>
second transport stream are processed such that timing errors induced by, for<br>
example, the first medium or access network 101 (or an initial transmission<br>
source) are corrected, if necessary.<br>
At step 240, the corrected packets associated with the second transport<br>
stream are provided to a back end device via a second medium in a second<br>
transport stream.<br>
At step 250, the second transport stream packets are retrieved and<br>
utilized. That is, at step 250 the back end device 104 retrieves from the second<br>
medium 103 the corrected packets forming the second transport stream and<br>
processes those packets to extract the underlying data, illustratively video data<br>
and associated audio data, which is then decoded and utilized (e.g.,<br>
presented).<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, the above-described transport<br>
streams and the audiovisual sub-streams included therein (i.e., video stream V<br>
and audio stream A processed by back-end device 104) may comprise<br>
transport streams, packetized elementary streams (PES) or elementary<br>
streams according to any of the Moving Pictures Experts Group (MPEG)<br>
standards. Specifically, a first standard known as MPEG-1 refers to ISO/IEC<br>
standards 11172 and is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. A<br>
second, known as MPEG-2, refers to ISO/IEC standards 13818 and is<br>
incorporated herein by reference. Additionally, a compressed digital video<br>
system is described in the Advanced Television Systems Committee (ATSC)<br>
digital television standard document A/53, which is incorporated herein by<br>
reference in its entirety. Similar standards such as those describing the MPEG-<br><br>
4, MPEG-7 and European Digital Video Broadcast (DVB) standards may also<br>
be advantageously applied and also incorporated here in by reference in their<br>
respective entireties. Additionally, various transport protocols such as ATM, IP,<br>
and the like are referenced in the above-cited standards documents and are<br>
also incorporated herein by reference in their respective entireties.<br>
Although various embodiments, which incorporate the teachings of the<br>
present invention, have been shown and described in detail herein, those<br>
skilled in the art can readily devise many other varied embodiments that still<br>
incorporate these teachings.<br><br>

ABSTRACT<br><br><br>
TITLE : "Apparatus and Method For Adapting a Second Transport<br>
Stream Included Within a First Transport Stream".<br>
The invention relates to an apparatus for adapting a second transport stream<br>
included within a first transport stream, comprising a modem (110), for receiving<br>
from a first medium (101) a first transport stream (ATM,IP) having disposed<br>
therein packets associated with a second transport stream (MPEG-1,2,4,7), said<br>
second transport stream packets being susceptible to timing errors; a data<br>
control module (120), for adapting said second transport stream packets in a<br>
manner tending to reduce said timing errors, said data control module (102)<br>
utilizing timing information recovered from at least one of said first transport<br>
stream and said second transport stream; and a transport interface (125), for<br>
providing said packets associated with said second transport stream to a back-<br>
end device (104) having a peripheral component interconnect (PCI) interface via<br>
a second non-PCI transport medium so as to bypass the PCI interface of the<br>
back-end device (104).</td>
