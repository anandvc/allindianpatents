				<td>Field of invention<br>
The present invention to a novel eco-friendly bio-process for tanning leather using enzymes. More particularly the present invention provides a process for de-hairing the leather and opening the fibres of the leather during the tanning process by employing commercially available enzyme and without using lime andother alkalis, which is an eco-friendly beam-house process. It is envisaged that the process of the present invention produces leather with equal or better properties . It is also visualized that the softness and grain smoothness of the leather would be improved and the pollution load from this bio-process would be significantly reduced compared to the conventional lime based process which is a multi-step process. Background and prior art references<br>
Conventional leather processing involves a number of unit processes and operations namely soaking, liming (dehairing), reliming(fibre opening), deliming, pickling, chrome/vegetable tanning, rechroming, neutralization, retanning.dyeing and fatliquoring. Liming-reliming processes are the inevitable steps in leather processing. The main objectives of liming are the removal of hair, flesh and splitting of fibre bundles by chemical and physical means. To achieve these, lime and sodium sulphide are employed along with substantial quantity of water. Various application methods include pit, paddle, drum and painting on flesh side. Generally, liming-reliming process liquors contribute to 50-70% of the total biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and chemical oxygen demand (COD) load from a tannery wastewater and 15-20% in the case of total solids (TS) load as reported by Aloy et al ( Tannery and Pollution, Centre Technique Du Cuir: Lyon, France, 1976).   Apart from this, a great deal of solid wastes containing lime<br><br>
sludge, fleshings, and hair are generated. The extensive use of sulphide bears unfavorable consequenceson environment and the efficacy of effluent treatment plants as reported by Colleran et al (Antonie van Leeuwenhoek, 67,29, 1995). Several lime and sulphide free liming methods have evolved during the past century. Bose and Dhar (Leather Science, 2, 140, 1955; 21, 39, 1974) have reviewed the use of enzymes such as proteolytic, amylolytic, etc from various sources namely animal, mold, bacterial and plant for dehairing hides and skins. However, these methods include the use of lime<br>
Yet another objective of the present invention is to provide a bio based beam-house process that totally obviates the formation of dry sludge. Still another objective of the present invention is to provide a three-step process that provides leathers matching the properties of leathers from conventional leather processing steps. Summary of the invention<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a novel three steps bio-process in leather processing the said process comprises<br>
I.	applying to raw skins or hides a dehairing paste containing an enzyme either<br>
individually or in combination with a dehairing enchancing compound that assists the enzyme.<br>
II.	seasoning the skins or hides of step (i) for 8-20 hrs.<br>
III.	de-hairing the skins or hides;<br>
IV.	applying to the de-haired skin or hide of step (iii) an enzyme either individually or in combination thereof or with an alkali that performs opening up of collagen fibre bundles;<br>
V.	fleshing followed by washing the skins or hides of step (iv) to obtain clean pelt<br>
having cross section pH of from 7.5 to 8.5 , and VI. tanning the skins or hides in the pH of from 7.5 to 8.5 followed by processing to obtain tanned leather.<br><br>

In still another embodiment of the present invention, the tanned leathers may be followed by conventional leather processing sequence to obtain leathers for different end use.<br>
The process of the present invention is described below in detail.<br><br>
The raw material, skins or hides, is soaked in water conventionally. The weight of the soaked skins or hides is noted after draining for 10 - 15 minutes. A dehairing enzyme or mixture of enzymes in the range of 0.5 - 2.0% on the weight of soaked skins or hides is mixed with a chemical that assists the enzyme in the range of 0 - 1.5% on the weight of soaked skins or hides in 4 - 8% water on the weight of soaked skins or hides to form a paste. The prepared paste is applied on the flesh or grain side of the soaked skins or hides and piled for 8-20 hrs. The skins or hides are then dehaired using a conventional procedure and the weight of the skins or hides is noted down. The dehaired skins or hides are mixed with 50 - 350% water on the weight of dehaired skins or hides conventionally. An enzyme or mixture of enzymes that capable of opening up of fibre bundles is added in the range of 0.5 - 2.0% on the weight of dehaired skins or hides. Alternatively an alkali in the range of 0.3 - 1.25% on the weight of dehaired skins or hides can be used for the same purposeThe duration of fibre opening treatment is in the range of 2 -24 hrs .The opened up skins/hides are fleshed conventionally. The weight of the pelts (skin or hide without hair and flesh) is noted. The cross section pH of the pelts is found to be 7.5 - 8.0. The pelts are tanned using basic chromium sulphate, vegetable tannins, chrome syntan, aluminium syntan, chromium-iron tanning agent, chromium-silica tanning agent in the range of 4 - 10% on the fleshed weight of skins or hides either alone or in combination with polymeric syntan in the range of 0.5 - 2.5% on the fleshed weight of skins or hides or other tanning agents in 50 - 150% water on the fleshed weight of skins or hides. The duration of tanning is in the range of 2 - 10 hrs. The tanned leathers are then followed by conventional leather processing sequence for different end uses.<br>
The novelty and non obviousness of the present development lies in using enzymes for dehairing that target hair as well as specific enzymes or alkali for fibre opening that target the cementing substances such as proteoglycans, which facilitates fibre opening. Also, it should be noted that all the aforesaid steps have been accomplished without pH adjustment. Thus this approach forms an eco-friendly bio-based beam house process that aims towards zero waste criteria and more particularly, eliminates the use of lime totally.<br>
