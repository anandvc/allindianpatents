				<td>SPACECRAFT THRUSTER<br>
BACKGROUND AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to the field of thrusters. Thrusters are used for propelling<br>
spacecrafts, with a typical exhaust velocity ranging from 2 km/s to more than 50 km/s,<br>
and density of thrust below or around 1 N/m2. In the absence of any material on which<br>
the thruster could push or lean, thrusters rely on the ejection of part of the mass of the<br>
spacecraft. The ejection speed is a key factor for assessing the efficiency of a thruster,<br>
and should typically be maximized.<br>
Various solutions were proposed for spatial thrusters. US-A-5 241 244 discloses a<br>
so-called ionic grid thruster. In this device, the propelling gas is first ionized, and the<br>
resulting ions are accelerated by a static electromagnetic field created between grids. The<br>
accelerated ions are neutralized with a flow of electrons. For ionizing the propelling gas,<br>
this document suggests using simultaneously a magnetic conditioning and confinement<br>
field and an electromagnetic field at the ECR (electron cyclotron resonance) frequency<br>
of the magnetic field. A similar thruster is disclosed in FR-A-2 799 576, induction being<br>
used for ionizing the gas. This type of thruster has an ejection speed of some 30 km/s,<br>
and a density of thrust of less than 1 N/m2 for an electrical power of 2,5 kW.<br>
One of the problems of this type of device is the need for a very high voltage<br>
between the accelerating grids. Another problem is the erosion of the grids due to the<br>
impact of ions. Last, neutralizes and grids are generally very sensitive devices.<br>
US-A-5 581 155 discloses a Hall effect thruster. This thruster also uses an<br>
electromagnetic field for accelerating positively-charged particles. The ejection speed in<br>
this type of thruster is around 15 km/s, with a density of thrust of less than 5 N/m2 for a<br>
power of l,3kW. Like in ionic grid thruster, there is a problem of erosion and the<br>
presence of neutralizer makes the thruster prone to failures.<br>
US-A-6 205 769 or DJ. Sullivan et al., Development of a microwave resonant<br>
cavity electrothermal thruster prototype, IEPC 1993, n°36, pp. 337-354 discuss<br>
microwave electrothermal thrusters. These thrusters rely on the heating of the propelling<br>
gas by a microwave field. The heated gas is ejected through a nozzle to produce thrust.<br>
This type of thruster has an ejection speed of some 9-12 km/s, and a thrust from 200 to<br>
2000 N.<br>
D.A. Kaufman et al., Plume characteristic of an ECR plasma thruster, EEPC 1993<br>
n°37, pp. 355-360 and H. Tabara et al., Performance characteristic of a space plasma<br>
simulator using an electron cyclotron resonance plasma accelerator and its application to<br>
material and plasma interaction research, IEPC 1997 n° 163, pp. 994-1000 discuss ECR<br>
plasma thrusters. In such a thruster, a plasma is created using electron cyclotron<br>
resonance in a magnetic nozzle. The electrons are accelerated axially by the magnetic<br>
dipole moment force, creating an electric field that accelerates the ions and produces<br>
thrust. In other words, the plasma flows naturally along the field lines of the decreasing<br>
magnetic field. This type of thruster has an ejection speed up to 35 km/s. US-B-6 293<br>
090 discusses a RF plasma thruster; its works according to the same principle, with'the<br>
main difference that the plasma is created by a lower hybrid wave, instead of using an<br>
ECR field.<br>
US-B-6 334 302 and F.R. Chang-Diaz, Design characteristic of the variable ISp<br>
plasma rocket, IEPC 1991, n° 128, disclose variable specific impulse magnetoplasma<br>
thruster (in short VaSIMR)..This thruster uses a three stage process of plasma injection,<br>
heating and controlled exhaust in a magnetic tandem mirror configuration. The source of<br>
plasma is a helicon generator and the plasma heater is a cyclotron generator. The nozzle<br>
is a radially diverging magnetic field. As in ECR or RF plasma thruster, ionized particles<br>
are not accelerated, but flow along the lines of the decreasing magnetic field. This type<br>
of thruster has an ejection speed of some 10 to 300 km/s, and a thrust of 50 to 1000 N.<br>
In a different field, US-A-4 641 060 and US-A-5 442 185 discuss ECR plasma<br>
generators, which are used for vacuum pumping or for ion implantation. Another<br>
example of a similar plasma generator is given in US-A-3 160 566.<br>
US-A-3 571 734 discusses a method and a device for accelerating particles. The<br>
purpose is to create a beam of particles for fusion reactions. Gas is injected into a<br>
cylindrical resonant cavity submitted to superimposed axial and radial magnetic fields.<br>
An electromagnetic field at the ECR frequency is applied for ionizing the gas. The<br>
intensity of magnetic field decreases along the axis of the cavity, so that ionized particles<br>
flow along this axis. This accelerating device is also discloses in the Compte Rendu de<br>
1'Academic des Sciences, November 4, 1963, vol. 257, p. 2804-2807. The purpose of<br>
these devices is to create a beam of particles for fusion reactions : thus, the ejection<br>
speed is around 60 km/s, but the density of thrust is very low, typically below 1,5 N/m2.<br>
3<br>
US-A-3 425 902 discloses a device for producing and confining ionized gases. The<br>
magnetic field is maximum at both ends of the chamber where the gases are ionized.<br>
European patent application EP-03290712 discloses a thruster using<br>
ponderomotive force thrust. Figure 1 is a schematic view in cross-section of a thruster of<br>
the prior art. The thruster 1 of figure 1 relies on electron cyclotron resonance for<br>
producing a plasma, and on magnetized ponderomotive force for accelerating this plasma<br>
for producing thrust. The ponderomotive force is the force exerted on a plasma due to a<br>
gradient in the density of a high frequency electromagnetic field. This force is discussed<br>
in H. Motz and C. J. H. Watson (1967), Advances in electronics and electron physics 23,<br>
pp. 153-302. In the absence of a magnetic field, this force may be expressed as<br>
The device of figure 1 comprises a tube 2. The tube has a longitudinal axis 4 which<br>
defines an axis of thrust; indeed, the thrust produced by the thruster 1 is directed along<br>
this axis - although it may be guided as explained below in reference to figures 10 to 13.<br>
The inside of the tube defines a chamber 6, in which the propelling gas is ionized and<br>
accelerated.<br>
In the example of figure 1, the tube is a cylindrical tube. It is made of a nonconductive<br>
material for allowing magnetic and electromagnetic fields to be produced<br>
within the chamber; one may use low permittivity ceramics, quartz, glass or similar<br>
materials. The tube may also be in a material having a high rate of emission of secondary<br>
electrons, such as BN, A^Oa, B4C. This increases electronic density in the chamber and<br>
improves ionization.<br>
The tube extends continuously along the thruster 1, gas being injected at one end of<br>
the tube. One could however contemplate various shapes for the tube. For instance, the<br>
cross-section of the tube, which is circular in this example, could have another shape,<br>
according to the plasma flow needed at the output of the thruster 1. Also, there is no need<br>
for the tube to extend continuously between the injector and the output of the thruster 1<br>
 (in which case the tube can be made of metals or alloys such as steel, W, Mo, Al, Cu,<br>
Th-W or Cu-W, which can also be impregnated or coated with Barium Oxide or<br>
Magnesium Oxide, or include radioactive isotope to enhance ionization) : as discussed<br>
below, the plasma are not confined by the tube, but rather by the magnetic and<br>
electromagnetic fields applied in the thruster 1. Thus, the tube could comprise two<br>
separate sections, while the chamber would still extend along the thruster 1, between the<br>
two sections of the tube.<br>
At one end of the tube is provided an injector 8. The injector injects ionizable gas<br>
into the tube, as represented in figure 1 by arrow 10. The gas may comprise inert gazes<br>
Xe, Ar, Ne, Kr, He, chemical compounds as H2, N2, NH3, N2H2, H2O or CH4 or even<br>
metals like Cs, Na, K or Li (alkali metals) or Hg. The most commonly used are Xe and<br>
H2, which need the less energy for ionization.<br>
The thruster 1 further comprises a magnetic field generator, which generates a<br>
magnetic field in the chamber 6. In the example of figure 1, the magnetic field generator<br>
comprises two coils 12 and 14. These coils produce within chamber 6 a magnetic field B,<br>
the longitudinal component of which is represented on figure 2. As shown on figure 2,<br>
the longitudinal component of the magnetic field has two maxima, the position of which<br>
corresponds to the coils. The first maximum Bmaxi, which corresponds to the first coil is located proximate the injector. It only serves for confining the plasma, and is not<br>
necessary for the operation of the thruster 1. However, it has the advantage of<br>
longitudinally confining the plasma electrons, so that ionization is easier by a magnetic<br>
bottle effect; in addition, the end of the tube and the injector nozzle are protected against<br>
f<br>
erosion. The second maximum BmaX2, corresponding to the second coil 14, makes it<br>
possible to confine the plasma within the chamber. It also separates the ionization<br>
volume of the thruster 1 - upstream of the maximum from the acceleration volume -<br>
downstream of the first maximum. The value of the longitudinal component of the<br>
magnetic field at this maximum may be adapted as discussed below. Between the two<br>
maxima - or downstream of the second maximum where the gas is injected, the magnetic<br>
field has a lower value. In the example of figure 1, the magnetic field has a minimum<br>
value B,nin substantially in the middle of the chamber.<br>
In the ionization volume of the thruster 1 - between the two maxima of the<br>
magnetic field in the example of figure 1 - the radial and orthoradial components of the<br>
magnetic field - that is the components of the magnetic field in a plane perpendicular to<br>
the longitudinal axis of the thruster 1 - are of no relevance to the operation of the thruster<br>
1; they preferably have a smaller intensity than the longitudinal component of the<br>
magnetic field. Indeed, they may only diminish the efficiency of the thruster 1 by<br>
inducing unnecessary motion toward the walls of the ions and electrons within the<br>
t<br>
chamber.<br>
In the acceleration volume of the thruster 1 - that is one right side, i.e.<br>
downstream, of the second maximum Bmaxa of the magnetic field in the example of<br>
figure 1 - the direction of the magnetic field substantially gives the direction of thrust.<br>
Thus, the magnetic field is preferably along the axis of the thrust. The radial and<br>
orthoradial components of the magnetic field are preferably as small as possible.<br>
Thus, in the ionization volume as well as in the acceleration volume, the magnetic<br>
field is preferably substantially parallel to the axis of the thruster 1. The angle between<br>
the magnetic field and the axis 4 of the thruster 1 is preferably less than 45°, and more<br>
preferably less than 20°. In the example of figures 1 and 2, this angle is substantially 0°,<br>
so that the diagram of figure 2 corresponds not only to the intensity of the magnetic field<br>
plotted along the axis of the thruster 1, but also to the axial component of the magnetic<br>
field.<br>
The intensity of the magnetic field generated by the magnetic field generator - that is the<br>
values Bnuxi. Bnux2 and Bmn - are preferably selected as follows. The maximum values<br>
are selected to allow the electrons of the plasma to be confined in the chamber; the<br>
higher the value of the mirror ratio Bmax/Bmm, the better the electrons are confined in the<br>
chamber. The value may be selected according to the (mass flow rate) thrust density<br>
wanted and to the power of the electromagnetic ionizing field (or the power for a given<br>
flow rate), so that 90% or more of the gas is ionized after passing the second peak of<br>
magnetic field. The lower value Bmin depends on the position of the coils. It does not<br>
have much relevance, except in the embodiment of figures 4 and 5. The fraction of<br>
electron lost from the bottle in percent can be expressed as:<br>
"tbsl<br>
For a given mass flow, and for a given thrust, a smaller aiost allows reducing the ionizing<br>
power for the same flow rate and ionization fraction.<br>
In addition, the magnetic field is preferably selected so that ions are mostly<br>
insensitive to the magnetic field. In other words, the value of the magnetic field is<br>
sufficiently low that the ions of the propelling gas are not or substantially not deviated by<br>
the magnetic field. This condition allows the ions of the propelling gas to fly through the<br>
tube substantially in a straight line, and improves the thrust. Defining the ion cyclotron<br>
frequency as<br>
flCR = q.Bmax/27lM<br>
the ion are defined as unmagnetized if the ion cyclotron frequency is much smaller<br>
than the ion collision frequency (or the ion Hall parameter, which is their ratio, is lower<br>
than 1)<br>
where q is the electric charge and M is the mass of the ions and Bmax the maximum value<br>
of the magnetic Meld. In this constraint, ficR is the ion cyclotron resonance frequency,<br>
and is the frequency at which the ions gyrates around magnetic field lines; the constraint<br>
is representative of the fact that the gyration time in the chamber is so long, as compared<br>
to the collision period, that the movement of the ions is virtually not changed due to the<br>
magnetic field, fjon-coiiision is defined, as known per se, as<br>
, a is the electron-ion collision cross section<br>
and VTH is the electron thermal speed. The thermal speed can be expressed as<br>
v ™ —"<br>
where k is the microscopic Boltzmann constant, T the temperature and mc the electron<br>
mass, fion-coiiision is representative of the number of collisions that one ion has per second<br>
in a cloud of electrons having the density N and the temperature T.<br>
Preferably, one would select the maximum value of the magnetic field so that<br>
Thus, the ion cyclotron resonance period in the thruster 1 is at least twice longer than the<br>
collision period of the ions in the chamber, or in the thruster 1.<br>
This is still possible, while have a sufficient confinement of the gas within the<br>
ionization volume of the thruster 1, as evidenced by the numerical example given below.<br>
The fact that the ions are mostly insensitive to the magnetic field first helps in focusing<br>
the ions and electrons beam the output of the thruster 1, thus increasing the throughput.<br>
In addition, this avoids that the ions remained attached to magnetic field lines after they<br>
leave the thruster 1; this ensures to produce net thrust.<br>
The thruster 1 further comprises an electromagnetic field generator, which<br>
generates an electromagnetic field in the chamber 6. In the example of figure 1, the<br>
electromagnetic field generator comprises a first resonant cavity 16 and a second<br>
resonant cavity 18, respectively located near the coils 12 and 14. The first resonant<br>
cavity 16 is adapted to generate an oscillating electromagnetic field in the cavity,<br>
between the two maxima of the magnetic field, or at least on the side of the maximum<br>
Bmaxa containing the injector, i.e. upstream. The oscillating field is ionizing field, with a<br>
frequency fBi in the microwave range, that is between 900 MHz and 80 GHz. The<br>
frequency of the electromagnetic field is preferably adapted to the local value of the<br>
magnetic field, so that an important or substantial part of the ionizing is due to the<br>
electron cyclotron resonance. Specifically, for a given value Bres of the magnetic field,<br>
the electron cyclotron resonance frequency fecR is given by formula:<br>
with e the electric charge and m the mass of the electron. This value of the frequency of<br>
the electromagnetic field is adapted to maximize ionization of the propelling gas by<br>
electron cyclotron resonance. It is preferable that the value of the frequency of the<br>
electromagnetic Meld fei is equal to the ECR frequency computed where the applied<br>
electromagnetic field is maximum. Of course, this is nothing but an approximation, since<br>
the intensity of the magnetic field varies along the axis and since the electromagnetic<br>
field is applied locally and not on a single point.<br>
One may also select a value of the frequency which is not precisely equal to this<br>
preferred value; a range of ±10% relative to the ECR frequency is preferred. A range of<br>
±5% gives better results. It is also preferred that at least 50% of the propelling gas is<br>
ionized while traversing the ionization volume or chamber. Such an amount of ionized<br>
gas is only made possible by using ECR for ionization; if the frequency of the<br>
electromagnetic field varies beyond the range of ±10% given above, the degree of<br>
ionization of the propelling gas is likely to drop well below the preferred value of 50%.<br>
The direction of the electric component of the electromagnetic field in the<br>
ionization volume is preferably perpendicular to the direction of the magnetic field; in<br>
any location, the angle between the local magnetic field and the local oscillating electric<br>
component of the electromagnetic field is preferably between 60 and 90°, preferably<br>
between 75 and 90°. This is adapted to optimize ionization by ECR. In the example of<br>
figure 1, the electric component of the electromagnetic field is orthoradial or radial: it is<br>
contained in a plane perpendicular to the longitudinal axis and is orthogonal to a straight<br>
line of this plane passing through the axis; this may simply be obtained by selecting the<br>
'resonance mode within the resonant cavity. In the example of figure 1, the<br>
electromagnetic field resonates in the mode TEm- An orthoradial field also has the<br>
advantage of improving confinement of the plasma in the ionizing volume and limiting<br>
contact with the wall of the chamber. The direction of the electric component of the<br>
electromagnetic field may vary with respect to this preferred orthoradial direction;<br>
preferably, the angle between the electromagnetic field and the orthoradial direction is<br>
less than 45°, more preferably less than 20°.<br>
In the acceleration volume, the frequency of the electromagnetic field is also<br>
preferably selected to be near or equal to the ECR frequency. This will allow the<br>
intensity of the magnetized ponderomotive force to be accelerating on both sides of the<br>
Electromagnetic field maximum, as shown in the second equation given above. Again,<br>
the frequency of the electromagnetic force need not be exactly identical to the ECR<br>
frequency. The same ranges as above apply, for the frequency and for the angles between<br>
the magnetic and electromagnetic fields. One should note at this stage that the frequency<br>
of the electromagnetic field used for ionization and acceleration may be identical: this<br>
simplifies the electromagnetic field generator, since the same microwave generator may<br>
be used for driving both resonant cavities.<br>
Again, it is preferred that the electric component of the electromagnetic field be in<br>
the purely radial or orthoradial, so as to maximize the magnetized ponderomotive force.<br>
In addition, an orthoradial electric component of electromagnetic field will focus the<br>
plasma beam at the output of the thruster 1. The angle between the electric component of<br>
the electromagnetic field and the radial or orthoradial direction is again preferably less<br>
than 45° or even better, less than 20°.<br>
Figure 2 is a diagram of the intensity of magnetic and electromagnetic fields along<br>
the axis of the thruster 1 of figure 1; the intensity of the magnetic field and of the<br>
electromagnetic field is plotted on the vertical axis. The position along the axis of the<br>
thruster 1 is plotted on the horizontal axis. As discussed above, the intensity of the<br>
magnetic field - which is mostly parallel to the axis of the thruster 1 - has two maxima.<br>
The intensity of the electric component of the electromagnetic field has a first maximum<br>
located in the middle plane of the first resonant cavity and a second maximum<br>
located at the middle plane of the second resonant cavity. The value of the intensity<br>
of first maximum is selected together with the mass flow rate within the ionization<br>
chamber. The value of the second maximum may be adapted to the Isp needed at the<br>
output of the thruster 1. In the example of figure 2, the frequency of the first and second<br>
maxima of the electromagnetic field are equal: indeed, the resonant cavities are identical<br>
and are driven by the same microwave generator. In the example of figure 2, the origin<br>
along the axis of the thruster 1 is at the nozzle of the injector.<br>
The following values exemplify the invention. The flow of gas is 6 mg/s, the total<br>
microwave power is approximately 1550 W which correspond to -350 W for ionisation<br>
and -1200 W for acceleration for a thrust of about 120mN . The microwave frequency is<br>
around 3GHz. The magnetic field could then have an intensity with a maximum of about<br>
180 mT and a minimum of -57 mT. Figure 2 also shows the value Bres of the magnetic<br>
field, at the location where the resonant cavities are located. As discussed above, the<br>
frequency of the electromagnetic field is preferably equal to the relevant ECR frequency<br>
eBres/27im.<br>
The following numerical values are exemplary of a thruster 1 providing an ejection<br>
speed above 20 km/s and a density of thrust higher than 100 N/m2. The tube is a tube of<br>
BN, having an internal diameter of 40 mm, an external diameter of 48 mm and a length<br>
of 260 mm. The injector is providing Xe, at a speed of 130 m/s when entering the tube,<br>
and with a mass flow rate of -6 mg/s.<br>
The first maximum of magnetic field Bmaxi is located at XBI = 20 mm from the<br>
nozzle of the injector; the intensity BmaXi of the magnetic field is -180 mT. The first<br>
resonant cavity for the electromagnetic field is located at XEI = 125mm from the nozzle<br>
of the injector; the intensity E\ of the magnetic field is -41000 V/m. The second<br>
maximum of magnetic field BmaX2 is located at Xn2 = 170 mm from the nozzle of the<br>
injector; the intensity BmaX2 of this magnetic field is -180 mT. The second resonant<br>
cavity for the electromagnetic field is located at \EZ = 205 mm from the nozzle of the<br>
injector; the intensity E2 of the magnetic field is -77000 V/m.<br>
. About 90 % of the gas passing into the acceleration volume (x &gt; XBZ) is ionized.<br>
. ficR is 15,9 MHz, since q = e and M = 130 amu. Thus, ion hall parameter is 0,2, so<br>
that the ions are mostly insensitive to the magnetic field.<br>
These values are exemplary. They demonstrate that the thruster 1 of the invention<br>
makes it possible to provide at the same time an ejection speed higher than 15km/s and a<br>
density of thrust higher than 100 N/m2. In terms of process, the thruster 1 of figure 1<br>
operates as follows. The gas is injected within a chamber. It is then submitted to a first<br>
magnetic field and a first electromagnetic field, and is therefore at least partly ionized.<br>
The partly ionized gas then passes beyond the peak value of magnetic field. It is then<br>
submitted to a second magnetic field and a second electromagnetic field which accelerate<br>
it due to the magnetized ponderomotive force. lonization and acceleration are separate<br>
and occur subsequently and are independently controllable.<br>
Yet, the thruster definied here relies on ECR for ionization and in the example of<br>
figure 1, as exposed above, the thruster also relies on coils for generating the desired<br>
magnetic field. Even though ECR is a very good method to ionize gases, it may also be<br>
difficult to start such discharge. It may also be difficult to realize the impedance<br>
matching. Moreover, the use of coils to generate the axial magnetic field is power<br>
consuming. Furthermore, coils produce a magnetic field outside of the thruster which can<br>
notably cause interference to other devices or even damage them. Besides, unless coils<br>
are made of supraconducting materials, they produce heat. Thus they have a negative<br>
impact on the energetic efficiency of the thruster and on the overall system mass as they<br>
demand an additional heat control system.<br>
Thus, there is a need for a thruster having a good ejection speed and versatility.<br>
There is also a need for a thruster which could be easily manufactured. Moreover, there<br>
is a need for a thruster even more robust, easier to use, lighter than the prior art. There is<br>
also a need for a thruster with less heating issues and resistant to failures. This defines a<br>
device accelerating both particles to high speed by applications of a directed body force.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
First, propellant is defined as the material whose ejection makes thrust. For<br>
instance, propellant may be gas. It could also be solid.<br>
Figure 3 is a schematic view in cross-section of a thruster 1 according to a first<br>
embodiment of the invention. The thruster 1 of figure 3 comprises obstruction means 50<br>
between the injector 8 and the main chamber 6 adapted to obstruct partly the main<br>
chamber 6. In other words, figure 3 discloses a thruster 1, having first a main chamber 6<br>
defining an axis 4 of thrust; second an injector 8 adapted to inject ionizable gas within<br>
the main chamber 6; third a ionizer 124 adapted to ionize the injected gas within the<br>
main chamber 6; fourth a first magnetic field generator 12, 14 and an electromagnetic<br>
field generator 18 adapted to generate a magnetized ponderomotive accelerating field<br>
downstream of said ionizer 124 along the direction of thrust on said axis 4; and fifth<br>
obstruction means 50, located downstream of the injector 8 and upstream of the main<br>
chamber 6, adapted to obstruct partly the main chamber 6. This makes injected gas be<br>
first reflected by the obstruction means before passing aside the obstruction means go<br>
along the main chamber 6. After being reflected, the gas goes back towards downstream<br>
of the main chamber because the upstream pressure is higher than the downstream one.<br>
This improves uniformity of the flow in the main chamber 6 and limits the gradient of<br>
neutral atom density in the main chamber 6, which can be desired if the energetic<br>
electrons are also more or less uniformly distributed inside the ionization area.. The<br>
obstruction means SO are made of non-conductive materials for allowing magnetic and<br>
electromagnetic fields to be produced within the main chamber 6; one may use low<br>
permittivity ceramics, quartz, glass or similar materials. Therefore, the magnetic and<br>
electromagnetic fields are less perturbed. The shape of the obstruction means 50 is<br>
adapted to the plasma flow desired at the output of the thrusters 1. The shape is hence<br>
adapted for instance to the shape of the tube 2. In the example of figure 3, the obstruction<br>
means 50 comprise two compounds obstructing partly the main chamber. The first<br>
obstruction means 50 is a disc 51. The second one is a ring diaphragm 49.<br>
Figure 4 is a schematic view in cross-section of a thruster 1 according to another<br>
embodiment of the invention. The thruster 1 of figure 4 comprises a quieting chamber<br>
48. In other words, figure 4 discloses a thruster 1, having first a main chamber 6 defining<br>
an axis 4 of thrust; second an injector 8 adapted to inject ionizable gas within the main<br>
chamber 6; third a ionizer 124 adapted to ionize the injected gas within the main<br>
chamber 6; fourth a first magnetic field generator 12, 14 and an electromagnetic field<br>
generator 18 adapted to generate a magnetized ponderomotive accelerating field<br>
downstream of said ionizer 124 along the direction of thrust on said axis 4; and fifth a<br>
quieting chamber 48 located downstream of the injector 8 and upstream of the main<br>
chamber 6 wherein the quieting chamber 48 is adapted to receive the ionizable gas. The<br>
quieting chamber 48 is located upstream of the main chamber 6. This quieting chamber<br>
48 has the advantage of protecting the injector nozzle against high energy electrons,<br>
which may pass beyond the barrier created by the first maximum Bmaxi of magnetic field.<br>
Such a quieting chamber 48 will improve uniformity of the flow in the main chamber 6<br>
and limit the gradient of density in the chamber. Such a quieting chamber 48 can be<br>
coupled with obstruction means to improve uniformity of the flow in the chamber and<br>
limit the gradient of density in the chamber. When the quieting chamber 48 is coupled<br>
with the obstruction means 50, the former 48 is located upstream of the latter 50.<br>
Figure 5 is a schematic view in cross-section of a thruster 1 according to another<br>
embodiment of the invention. The thruster 1 of figure 5 comprises a compression<br>
chamber 58. The compression chamber 58 is an injector 8. Such a compression chamber<br>
58 is adapted to bring propellant to the desired pressure for instance by changing the<br>
temperature. Propellant can be also brought to the desired pressure by reducing<br>
mechanically the volume of a closed chamber. It is also possible to compress gas in a<br>
continuous way: such a compression chamber 58 has upstream communication means 59<br>
and downstream communication means 61; the sum of the surfaces of upstream<br>
communication means 59 is greater than the sum of the surfaces of downstream<br>
apertures. Thus, such a compression chamber 58 can be substantially convergent-shaped<br>
in the stream direction. In the example of figure 5, the compression chamber is tapered.<br>
This allows to compress gas surrounding the thruster 1, for instance atmospheric gas. In<br>
case of a spacecraft which comprises the thruster, the gas surrounding the thruster is gas<br>
outside the thruster, i.e. gas outside the spacecraft. This gas is compressed in order to get<br>
a desired pressure and density upstream of the main chamber. Such pressure and density<br>
being adapted to the operating condition of the thruster, i.e. the desired thrust and the<br>
specific impulse. Thus, there is no need to store propellant. Such a compression chamber<br>
can be used for upper atmospheric gas in extremely rarefied condition or even to use<br>
interplanetary plasma, also known as solar wind. At lower altitude, the pressure of the<br>
atmospheric gas is greater than needed for the thruster I.<br>
Figure 6 is a schematic view in cross-section of a thruster 1 according to another<br>
embodiment of the invention. The thruster 1 of figure 6 comprises an expansion<br>
chamber. The expansion chamber 60 is an injector 8. Such a chamber has upstream<br>
communication means 59 and downstream communication means 61. The sum of the<br>
surfaces of downstream communication means 61 is greater than the sum of the surfaces<br>
of upstream communication means 59. Thus, such an expansion chamber 60 is<br>
substantially divergent-shaped in the stream direction. This allows to expand gas<br>
surrounding the thruster 1, i.e. atmospheric gas, in order to get desired pressure and<br>
density upstream of the main chamber 6. Thus, this prevents from storing propellant.<br>
Such an expansion chamber can be used for atmospheric gas where the pressure and<br>
density of the atmospheric gas is greater than needed. The upstream communication<br>
means 59 may be apertures in the expansion chamber 60 wall. Upstream communication<br>
means 59 can be controlled by valves.<br>
In other words, figure 5 and 6 disclose a thruster 1, having first a main chamber 6<br>
defining an axis 4 of thrust; second an injector 8 adapted to inject ionizable gas within<br>
the main chamber 6; third a ionizer 124 adapted to ionize the injected gas within the<br>
main chamber 6; and fourth a first magnetic field generator 12, 14 and an<br>
electromagnetic field generator 18 adapted to generate a magnetized ponderomotive<br>
accelerating field downstream of said ionizer 124 along the direction of thrust on said<br>
axis 4; wherein the injected ionizable gas is gas surrounding the thruster 1. Once again,<br>
this suppresses or reduces the necessity of storing propellant.<br>
Figure 7 is a schematic view in cross-section of a thruster 1 according to another<br>
embodiment of the invention. The thruster 1 of figure 7 comprises an injector 8 adapted<br>
to inject ionizable gas directly within the ionization area of the main chamber 6. In other<br>
words, figure 7 discloses a thruster 1, having first a main chamber 6 defining an axis 4 of<br>
thrust; second an injector 8 adapted to inject ionizable gas within the main chamber 6;<br>
third a ionizer 124 adapted to ionize the injected gas within the main chamber 6; and<br>
fourth a first magnetic field generator 12, 14 and an electromagnetic field generator, 18<br>
adapted to generate a magnetized ponderomotive accelerating field downstream of said<br>
ionizer 124 along the direction of thrust on said axis 4; wherein the injector 8 is adapted<br>
to inject ionizable gas where the ionizing field is applied in the main chamber 6. This has<br>
the advantage of injecting ionizable gas where the density of energized electrons is the<br>
greatest in the main chamber 6. Thus, the ionizing collision frequency is greater. This<br>
injection may be done through a slot 54 in the wall of the tube 2 of the main chamber 6.<br>
This improves the uniformity of the injected gas since the stream of the injected gas has<br>
the same symmetry as the one of the slot. The injection may also be done through at least<br>
one hole 56 in the wall of the tube 2 of the main chamber 6. This also improves<br>
ionization efficiency since the pressure stream of the injected gas make it reach quicker<br>
the center of the area with high density of energized electrons inside the main chamber 6.<br>
In the example of figure 7, gas is injected through a slot 54 and a hole 56 within the<br>
ionization area of the main chamber 6. By increasing neutral atom density at the same<br>
location where the energized electrons distribution is maximum, when the energized<br>
electrons are not distributed uniformly inside the ionization are, the ionization efficiency<br>
is improved. Hence, the overall thruster energetic efficiency is improved.<br>
Figure 8 is a schematic view in cross-section of a thruster 1 according to another<br>
embodiment of the invention. The thruster 1 of figure 8 comprises an injector 8 adapted<br>
to inject ionizable gas in the main chamber 6 along the main chamber 6. This limits the<br>
effects of an upstream injection on axial uniformity. Thus, this improves gas uniformity<br>
along the main chamber 6. In the example of figure 8, gas is injected through regularly<br>
spaced apertures in the wall of the tube 2.<br>
Figure 9 is a schematic view in cross-section of a thruster 1 according to another<br>
embodiment of the invention. Figure 10 is a diagram of the intensity of magnetic field<br>
along the axis of the thruster 1 of figure 9. The thruster 1 of figure 9 comprises first a<br>
main chamber 6 defining an axis 4 of thrust. It also comprises an injector 8 adapted to<br>
inject ionizable gas within the main chamber 6. Moreover, it comprises a first magnetic<br>
field generator 12 adapted to generate a magnetic field, said magnetic field having at<br>
least a first maximum along the axis 4, said magnetic field being substantially axial and<br>
decreasing along the axis 4.. Furthermore, it comprises an ionizer 124 adapted to<br>
generate a ionizing area in the main chamber 6, downstream of said first maximum, and<br>
a magnetized ponderomotive accelerating field downstream of said microwave ionizing<br>
field. In other words, figure 9 discloses a thruster 1, having first a main chamber 6<br>
defining an axis 4 of thrust; second an injector 8 adapted to inject ionizable gas within<br>
the main chamber 6; third a ionizer 124 adapted to ionize the injected gas within the<br>
main chamber 6; and fourth a first magnetic field generator 12, 14 and an<br>
electromagnetic field generator 18 adapted to generate a magnetized ponderomotive<br>
accelerating field downstream of said ionizer 124 along the direction of thrust on said<br>
axis 4; wherein the first magnetic field generator 12, 14 is coil less. This allows the use<br>
of ponderomotive force for the thruster 1 using a magnetic field which substantially<br>
decreases along the axis. This allows to use magnets and electromagnets instead of coils<br>
for the realization of the magnetic field generator 12, and hence to avoid the mass and<br>
heat drawbacks of coils.<br>
In this embodiment, the thrusters 1 may comprise a magnetic circuit 68 made of<br>
materials with magnetic permeability greater than the vacuum one. This allows to apply<br>
efficiently the magnetic field at the location where useful. Moreover, it prevents from<br>
having large fringing magnetic field outside the thruster which might disturb other<br>
spacecraft subsystem. This also makes electromagnet use less power for producing a<br>
similar magnetic field at location where desired. The magnetic circuit 68 is adapted to<br>
generate a magnetic field substantially parallel to the axis of the main chamber 6. This<br>
has the advantage to create and to improve the ponderomotive force. The magnetic field<br>
of this circuit 68 is downstream divergent. This allows the downstream plasma to detach<br>
more easily from the magnetic field. Thus, this reduces the plasma beam divergence and<br>
henceimproves the thrust. The magnetic circuit may be non-continuous. That is the<br>
magnetic circuit may comprise regions or elements which have a relative magnetic<br>
permeability equal to the vacuum one. The shape of the magnetic circuit is adapted to the<br>
plasma flow needed at the output of the thrusters. The shape is hence adapted for<br>
instance to the shape of the tube 2. Another advantage of this magnetic circuit 68 is the<br>
compounds that may be used.<br>
The magnetic field generator 12, 14 may comprise at least one magnet 64. A<br>
magnet 64 has notably the advantage over a coil, or an electromagnet not to be<br>
dependant on any power source and not to heat. The magnetic field generator 12,14 may<br>
also comprise at least one electromagnet 64. An electromagnet 66 has notably the<br>
advantage over coils to consume less electrical energy and to heat less. An electromagnet<br>
66 has the advantage over a magnet 64 to be controllable.<br>
Figure 11 is a schematic view in cross-section of a thruster according to another<br>
embodiment of the invention. Figure 12 is a diagram of the intensity of magnetic field<br>
along the axis of the thruster of figure. The thruster of figure 11 comprises at least a<br>
second magnetic generator 70 adapted to generate a magnetic field, said magnetic field<br>
being superimposed with the first magnetic field produces at least a second maximum of<br>
magnetic field intensity along the axis 4, said second maximum being downstream of the<br>
said first maximum and upstream of the magnetized ponderomotive accelerating field. In<br>
other words, figure 11 discloses thruster 1 further comprising at least a second magnetic<br>
field generator 70 adapted to generate a magnetic field and to create a magnetic bottle<br>
effect along the axis 4 upstream of the magnetized ponderomotive accelerating field.<br>
Indeed, such a magnetic field generator allows to create the magnetic bottle effect.<br>
Indeed, a second magnetic field maximum is created downstream of the first magnetic<br>
field maximum and upstream of the magnetized ponderomotive accelerating field. In<br>
other words, the second magnetic field generator 70 generates a field along the axis 4,<br>
which has the same direction as the field generated by the first magnetic field generator<br>
12, 14. Thus, this allows to increase the total magnetic field intensity on the axis 4,<br>
downstream of the first magnetic field maximum and upstream of the magnetized<br>
ponderomotive accelerating field, in adding the second magnetic field generator 70 at the<br>
plumb of the magnetic field second maximum. Hence, the main chamber 6 is not limited<br>
35-<br>
by the wall of the tube 2 but by the magnetic field lines. This increases the overall<br>
thruster energetic efficiency by limiting the flux of electrons and ions colliding with the<br>
actual material wall of the chamber. This second magnetic field generator 70 may be<br>
realized using a coil, as in the example of figure 10, its energy needs will be lower than<br>
when using a structure using only coils.<br>
Figure 13 is a schematic view in cross-section of a thruster according to another<br>
embodiment of the invention. Figure 14 is a diagram of the intensity of magnetic field<br>
along the axis of the thruster of figure 13. The thruster of figure 13 is such that the first<br>
magnetic circuit 68 is adapted to be closed downstream of the microwave ionizing field<br>
in the main chamber 6 and upstream of the magnetized ponderomotive accelerating field.<br>
It also comprises a third magnetic field generator 72 adapted to generate a magnetic<br>
field, said magnetic field having at least a third maximum along the axis 4, said third<br>
magnetic field generator 72 being downstream of the first magnetic field generator 12,<br>
14 and at least overlapping a magnetized ponderomotive accelerating field. Along the<br>
axis, the first and third magnetic fields generated by the first 12, 14 and third 72<br>
magnetic field generators may be of same or opposite polarity. This arrangement may be<br>
lighter and requires much less electrical power than when using only one magnetic field<br>
generator 12, 14 and a second magnetic field generator 70 comprising a coil. It creates<br>
the bottle effect. It also creates a cusp, i.e. a region where there is no magnetic field,<br>
upstream of the third magnetic field generator 72. It is therefore advantageous that, when<br>
the axis of the thruster does not pass through the created cusp; the wall of the tube 2 be<br>
near the borders of this magnetic field free region, but avoids passing through this zone.<br>
The first 12, 14 and third 72 magnetic field generators may have a first common<br>
compound 74. If there is a common compound 74, this one might be located at the plumb<br>
of the cusp. When the axis of the thruster passes through the magnetic field cusp; even if<br>
the flow of plasma substantially follows the magnetic field lines, plasma is repelled from<br>
region where the gradient of magnetic field intensity is too important. This is the mirror<br>
effect. It is due to a great gradient of the magnetic field proximate the common<br>
compound 74 of both first 12, 14 and third 70 magnetic field generators. Since the<br>
plasma is repelled from the tube walls, it is confined along the axis, which is sought. The<br>
first common compound 74 may comprise a magnet, an electromagnet, or a coil. This<br>
embodiment presents the same advantage as the advantages of using a magnet, an<br>
electromagnet exposed above. It allows also to have a magnetic bottle along the thruster<br>
axis f upstream of the accelerating field. Figure 15 is a schematic view in cross-section<br>
of a thruster according to another embodiment of the invention. Figure 16 is a diagram of<br>
the intensity of magnetic field along the axis of the thruster of figure 15. The thruster of<br>
figure 15 comprises a fourth magnetic field generator 76 adapted to generate a magnetic<br>
field, said magnetic field having at least a third maximum along the axis 4, said fourth<br>
magnetic field generator 76 being downstream of the third magnetic field generator 72.<br>
Along the axis, the fourth and third magnetic fields generated by the fourth 76 and third<br>
72 magnetic field generators may be of opposite polarities. When both the fourth and<br>
third magnetic fields generated by the fourth 76 and third 72 magnetic field generators<br>
are of opposite polarities, it creates a cusp, the axis 4 of the thruster 1 passing through the<br>
created cusp. This allows the plasma to escape more easily from magnetic field. Indeed,<br>
this corresponds to enlarge the region downstream of the accelerating region where there<br>
is no magnetic field. Thus, the magnetic field gradient is increased in this accelerating<br>
region. Therefore, the divergence of the plasma beam might be reduced. There is also a<br>
mirror effect between both magnetic field generators 72, 76. In another embodiment, the<br>
fourth 76 and third 72 magnetic field generators may have a second common compound<br>
78. This second common compound 78 may comprise a magnet, an electromagnet, or a<br>
coil. This embodiment presents the same advantage as the advantage of using a magnet,<br>
an electromagnet, or a coil, as exposed above and when the fourth magnetic field<br>
generator is somehow controllable, this brings a greater control over the acceleration<br>
region and the outlet region which make the thruster more versatile.<br>
Figures 17 to 20 are schematic views of various embodiments of the thruster,<br>
which allow the direction of thrust to be changed. This ability to change thrust direction<br>
is called thrust vectoring. As discussed above, the ponderomotive force is directed along<br>
the lines of the magnetic field. Thus, modifying the direction and the intensity of the<br>
magnetic field lines inside and downstream of the accelerating area of the thruster makes<br>
it possible to change the direction of thrust. Figure 20 is a view in cross section of<br>
another embodiment of the thruster. The thruster is similar to the one of figure 1. The<br>
thruster of figure 20 comprises a fifth magnetic field generator 82 adapted to modify the<br>
magnetic field within and downstream of the accelerating field. Thus, it is possible to<br>
vary the direction. In other words, figure 20 discloses a thruster 1, having first a main<br>
chamber 6 defining an axis 4 of thrust; second an injector 8 adapted to inject ionizable<br>
gas within the main chamber 6; third a ionizer 12 adapted to ionize the injected gas<br>
within the main chamber 6; and fourth a first magnetic field generator 12, 14 and an<br>
electromagnetic field generator 18 adapted to generate a magnetized ponderomotive<br>
accelerating field downstream of said ionizer 124 along the direction of thrust on said<br>
axis 4; and a fifth magnetic field generator 82 adapted to vary the direction of the<br>
magnetic field downstream of the magnetized ponderomotive accelerating field. In the<br>
example of figure 20, the thruster is provided with a fifth magnetic field generator 82,<br>
that comprises in this example four additional direction control electromagnets 84, 86, 88<br>
and 90 located downstream of the magnetized ponderomotive accelerating field. These<br>
electromagnets need to be offset with respect to the axis of the thruster, so as to change<br>
the direction of the magnetic field downstream of the magnetic field generator which is<br>
located at most downstream. Moreover, these electromagnets can also be equidistant<br>
from the axis 4 of the main chamber 6. Figure 19 is a front view showing the four<br>
electromagnets 84, 86, 88 and 90 and the tube 2; it further shows the various magnetic<br>
fields that may be created by energizing one or several of these electromagnets, which<br>
are represented symbolically by arrows within the tube 2. Preferably, the electromagnets<br>
generate a magnetic field with a direction contrary to the one created by upstream of<br>
magnetic field generator 12 and 14; this further increases the gradient of magnetic field,<br>
and therefore the thrust. Furthermore, energizing the electromagnets with a reversible<br>
current makes it possible to vary the thrust direction over a broader range and use less<br>
electromagnets (2 or 3 instead of 4) but use a more complex power supply. It is also<br>
possible to use mere magnets. Yet, they need to be moved about in order to make the<br>
downstream magnetic field vary.<br>
Figure 17 is a front view similar to the one of figure 19, but in a thruster having<br>
only two additional electromagnets 84, 88. Figure 18 is a front view similar to the one of<br>
figure 19, but in a thruster having only three additional electromagnets.<br>
In the examples of figures 17 to 20, the direction control fifth magnetic field<br>
generator 82 is located as close as possible to the second cavity, i.e. to the downstream of<br>
the magnetized ponderomotive accelerating field, so as to act on the magnetic field in or<br>
close to the acceleration volume. It is advantageous that the intensity of the magnetic<br>
field in the direction control fifth magnetic field generator 82 be selected so that the<br>
magnetic field still decreases substantially continuously downstream of the thruster; this<br>
avoid any mirror effect that could locally trap the plasma electrons. The value of<br>
magnetic field created by the direction control fifth magnetic field generator 82 is<br>
preferably from 5% to 95% of the main field so that it nowhere reverses the direction of<br>
the magnetic field within the ponderomotive accelerating field.<br>
Figures 21 is a schematic view of another embodiment of the thruster. Figure 22 is<br>
a schematic view in cross-section of a thruster according to the thruster of figure 21.<br>
Figure 23 is a diagram of the intensity of magnetic and electromagnetic fields along the<br>
axis of the thruster of figure 21. Figure 21 comprises a sixth magnetic field generator 96<br>
adapted to confine the ionized gas in the plane perpendicular to the axis 4. In other<br>
words, figure 21 discloses a thruster 1, having first a main chamber 6 defining an axis 4<br>
of thrust; second an injector 8 adapted to inject ionizable gas within the main chamber 6;<br>
third a ionizer 124 adapted to ionize the injected gas within the main chamber 6; and<br>
fourth a first magnetic field generator 12, 14 and an electromagnetic field generator 18<br>
adapted to generate a magnetized ponderomotive accelerating field downstream of said<br>
ionizer 124 along the direction of thrust on said axis 4; and a sixth magnetic field<br>
generator 96 adapted to confine ionized gas upstream of the magnetized ponderomotive<br>
accelerating field. The sixth magnetic field generator 96 is downstream of the first<br>
magnetic field generator 12,14. The sixth magnetic field generator 96 can bedownstream<br>
of the magnetic field generator 12 and / or upstream of the ionizer 124 and downstream<br>
of the ionizer 124 down to the thruster exhaust. Preferably, the sixth magnetic field<br>
generator 96 is even more useful over the section comprised downstream of the ionizer<br>
124 and upstream of the generator of the ponderomotive accelerating field 18. This better<br>
confines the charged particles before their acceleration. Therefore, the sixth magnetic<br>
field generator 96 is at least within of the means creating the bottle effect. This<br>
confinement is realised in creating a cusp comprising the axis 4 and its vicinities. The<br>
vicinities are bordered by the magnetic field lines of the sixth magnetic field generator<br>
96. This is possible in creating a mirror effect in the plane perpendicular to the axis 4 of<br>
the main chamber 6. Therefore, the plasma is repelled towards the axis 4.. Thus, it limits<br>
energetic loss. It also prevents the wall of the tube from heating. Moreover, it improve<br>
the energetic efficiency of the thruster since there is a greater plasma density for a similar<br>
ionization energy. This is for instance realised by using a set of a pair plurality of<br>
magnetic field generators 96-106. The magnetic axis of each of these generators 96-106<br>
is defined as the straight line between the centres, centres of gravity, of each magnetic<br>
poles, or ending cross-section, of each generator. The magnetic axes can be substantially<br>
parallel to the local tangent to the wall of the tube 2 and substantially perpendicular to<br>
the longitudinal axis 4 of the main chamber 6. In another embodiment, the magnetic axis<br>
are perpendicular to the local tangent and to the longitudinal axis 4 of the main chamber<br>
6. The magnetic field generators 96-106 can be arranged so that each pole of a generator<br>
96-106 faces the pole of the neighboured generator 96-106 which has the same polarity.<br>
Alternatively, each pole of any generator has the same polarity as the pole of the<br>
generator symetrically opposite of it regarding the axis 4 of the main chamber 6, for<br>
example 96 and 102, or 106 and 100 in figure 21. The magnetic field generators 96-106<br>
are also arranged so that there are included in at least a cross-section of the tube 2<br>
perpendicular to the axis 4 of the main chamber 6. Preferably, there are at least four<br>
magnetic field generators. This prevents from having any possible radial leak of plasma<br>
since there is a mirror effect in all the radial directions. Indeed, if there are only two<br>
magnetic field generators, there is one direction that is not bordered by converging<br>
magnetic field lines, that is by magnetic field lines that could prevent the plasma from<br>
leaking in the plane perpendicular to the axis 4 of the main chamber 6. This embodiment<br>
may be realised with magnets, electromagnets or coils.<br>
Figure 24 is a schematic view in cross-section of a thruster according to another<br>
embodiment of the invention. Figure 24 comprises securing means 94 adapted to secure<br>
at least two compounds of the thruster. In other words, figure 24 discloses a thruster 1,<br>
having first a main chamber 6 defining an axis 4 of thrust; second an injector 8 adapted<br>
to inject ionizable gas within the main chamber 6; third a ionizer 124 adapted to ionize<br>
the injected gas within the main chamber 6; and fourth a first magnetic field generator<br>
12, 14 and an electromagnetic field generator, 18 adapted to generate a magnetized<br>
ponderomotive accelerating field downstream of said ionizer 124 along the direction of<br>
thrust on said axis 4; and securing means 94 adapted to secure at least two compounds of<br>
the thruster 1. This allows to set distances between compounds of the thruster.<br>
Compounds of the thruster comprise any device used in an embodiment. In the example<br>
of figure 24, the compounds are the injector 8, first magnetic field generator 12, 14, the<br>
tube 2, the electromagnetic field generators, 18. Hence, this prevents the compounds to<br>
move. Thus, it prevents compounds from damages. Distances are also controlled. This<br>
can be realized in gluing or molding the compounds of the thruster in a castable material,<br>
i.e. a partially fluid material which can harden to solid, such as a ceramic, glass or a<br>
resin. Yet, this material is heavy, may heat, and prevents from any future movement of<br>
the compounds - for instance to access a compound. Preferably, securing means <br>
adapted to prevent movement of compounds even when the compounds are exposed to a<br>
force greater than one giga Newton. Notably, it prevents movement in case of<br>
accelerations, vibrations and shocks of intensity and duration similar to the one<br>
undergone by any spacecraft part during orbital launch onboard a rocket. The securing<br>
means can be a grid, a plate, a bar, or a web along the axis 4. The selection among these<br>
different securing means 94 depends on a compromise between their weights, solidities,<br>
or shape according to the thruster 1 Securing means can have a shape adapted to the<br>
thruster. In the example of figure 24, the securing means are two bars.<br>
A mode is defined as the spatial distribution of the intensity and phase of the<br>
electromagnetic energy field within a resonant cavity 112. In the accelerating region, it is<br>
advantageous to select a mode such that there is a maximum of electromagnetic energy<br>
within the main chamber 6, or even within the tube 2. This allows toincrease the<br>
ponderomotive force. Yet, in the resonant cavity 112, the electrical permittivity of the<br>
plasma may transform the modes within the resonant cavity 112, and / or may make their<br>
frequency vary. Therefore, in another embodiment of the invention, the thruster 1<br>
comprises first a main chamber 6 defining an axis 4 of thrust; second an injector 8<br>
adapted to inject ionizable gas within the main chamber 6; third a ionizer 124 adapted to<br>
ionize the injected gas within the main chamber 6; and fourth a first magnetic field<br>
generator 12, 14 and an electromagnetic field generator 18 adapted to generate a<br>
magnetized ponderomotive accelerating field downstream of said ionizer 124 along the<br>
direction of thrust on said axis 4; and at least one resonant cavity 112; wherein the<br>
electromagnetic field generator 18 is adapted to control the mode of the resonant cavity<br>
Figure 25 is a schematic view in cross-section of a thruster according to another<br>
embodiment of the invention. The electromagnetic field generator 18 of figure 25 further<br>
comprises a housing 110 adapted to generate stationary electromagnetic waves in the<br>
resonant cavity 112. A housing 110 is defined as a system adapted to provide the<br>
resonant cavity 112 with microwave power through more than one connection means and<br>
with a defined phase relation between them. This housing 110 guides electromagnetic<br>
waves to the resonant cavity. 112 Therefore, the creation of stationary waves in the<br>
housing 110 provides stationary electromagnetic waves in the resonant cavity 112. Then,<br>
stationary electromagnetic waves allow to control the modes of the resonant cavity 112.<br>
Stationary waves can be selected to get electomagnetic energy maxima where desired,<br>
for instance along the axis where the plasma is confined or where the main chamber 6<br>
passes.<br>
It is advantageous to have a housing 110 sufficiently large in at least one<br>
dimension to obtain stationary electromagnetic waves. Yet, this increases the weight of<br>
the thruster 1. In the example of figure 24, the housing 110 is adapted to contain the<br>
resonant cavity 112. This limits the modification of the modes pattern by plasma or / and<br>
the variation of the frequency of the modes in the resonant cavity 112. Indeed, the<br>
plasma is contained within the resonant cavity 112 and in no other area of the housing.<br>
Therefore, the plasma can not modify the modes within the housing outside of the<br>
resonant cavity 112, and / or can not either may make their frequency vary. Reciprocally,<br>
the stationary waves inside the housing outside of the cavity prevent the mode inside the<br>
cavity from changing. In other words, as the plasma affects only the part of the complete<br>
standing wave pattern contained in the cavity and not in the part contained in the rest of<br>
the housing, the overall mode is more robust. Thus, the mode is less modified, i.e. a<br>
given modification of the mode requires more energy.. Thus, the mode is fixed from<br>
outside the resonant cavity. The housing 1 10 may be connected to the electromagnetic<br>
field generator 18 by various connection means such as a magnetic loop, a slot, or an<br>
electric dipole antenna. The choice of the connection means and of the place of<br>
connection defines the existing modes.<br>
When the mode is such that there are several electromagnetic energy maxima or a<br>
maximum outside the axis 4 of the thruster, the shape and localisation of the tube 2 and<br>
of the main chamber 6 may be adapted to the radial localisation of the maxima. For<br>
instance, the tube can be divided in several secondary tubes. This allows to use the<br>
modes with a minimum along the axis 4. Thus, this optimizes the exhaust surface-tofoot-<br>
print ratio of the thruster, the foot-print being the overall cross section surface<br>
required to mount the thruster.<br>
Figure 26 is a schematic view in cross-section of a thruster according to another<br>
embodiment of the invention. Figure 26 comprises solid material means 122 inside the<br>
resonant cavity 112 but outside of the main chamber 6. The solid material means 122 are<br>
adapted to modify the modes due to their electrical permittivity and/or magnetic<br>
permeability. Thus, these solid material means 122 are used to select and control the<br>
modes. The solid material means 122 are preferably outside of the main chamber 6<br>
because, if they were inside the main chamber 6, they would be submitted to intense<br>
energetic ion bombardment. These solid material means 122 can be moveable so that<br>
they allow dynamic tuning of the resonant cavity. This improves the energetic coupling<br>
efficiency.<br>
Figures 27-38 are schematic views in cross-section of various ionizers 124 of a<br>
thruster according to other embodiments of the invention. Figure 27-38 comprise an<br>
injector 8 and an ionizer 124. The ionizer 124 of figure 27 comprises at least one metallic<br>
surface 126, said metallic surface 126 having a work function greater than the first<br>
ionization potential of the propellant. Such an ionizer is defined as contact ionization<br>
structure. This is described in vvContact Ionization Ion sources for Ion Cyclotron<br>
Resonance Separation", Jpn. J. Appl. Phys. 33 (1994) 4247-4250, Tatsuya Suzuki,<br>
Kazuko Takahashi, Masao Nomura, Yasuhiko Fujii and Makoto Okamoto. Because it<br>
can be used as a primary provider of ions, a contact ionization structure can be used as an<br>
ionizer 124. A contact ionization structure consists of a metallic surface 126 in contact<br>
with the ionisable media, i.e. gas for instance, this can take the form of a porous metallic<br>
section through which the gas is injected inside the main chamber 6. A work function is<br>
defined as the minimum energy required to extract an electron from the solid material for<br>
example by photoemission. The propellant is ionized if its potential of first ionization is<br>
lower than the work function of the solid material surface.<br>
Figure 28 comprises an injector 8 and an ionizer 124. The ionizer 124 of figure 28<br>
comprises at least one electron emitter 128. Indeed, ionization of injected gas may be<br>
obtained by submitting the injected gas to electron bombardment or electron impact.<br>
Indeed, when an electron and a neutral atom collide, if the kinetic energy of the electron<br>
is higher than the ionization energy of the atom, the neutral atom can be ionized. A very<br>
simple electron bombardment ionization structure can consist of an electron emitter 128<br>
inside the main chamber 6. An electron emitter can be an electron-gun, a hot cathode, a<br>
cold cathode, a hollow cathode, a radioactive source, or a piezo-electric crystal. The<br>
greatest ionization probability is usually reached when the electron average kinetic<br>
energy is approximately equal to two to five times the ionization energy of the<br>
propellant. This means that to be more efficient the ionization structure should include<br>
means for increasing the kinetic energies of free electrons to this energy range — usually<br>
around 50 to 200 eV. Such an ionizer 124 comprising at least one electron emitter 128 is<br>
described in "The performance and plume characterization of a laboratory gridless ion<br>
thruster with closed drift acceleration", AIAA Joint Propulsion Conference , AIAA-<br>
2004-3936, 2004 by Paterson Peter Y. and Galimore Alec D.<br>
Figure 29 comprises an injector 8 and an ionizer 124. The ionizer 124 of figure 29<br>
comprises at least two electrodes 130 inside the main chamber 6, the said electrodes 130<br>
having different electric potentials. This allows increasing kinetic energies of the<br>
electrons by applying them a permanent electric field. An ionizer 124 can comprise two<br>
electrodes 130 held at different electrical potential within the main chamber 6, the<br>
negatively charged one - a cathode - also acting as an electron provider and being<br>
preferably located adjacent to propellant injection to reduce the probability of ions<br>
impinging on the cathode and eroding it. Such an ionizer 124 comprising at least two<br>
electrodes (130) inside the main chamber 6, the said electrodes (130) having different<br>
electric potentials. In another embodiment, the thruster 1 comprises cooling means 167<br>
adapted to remove heat from at least one compound of the thruster. In other words, the<br>
two electrodes 130 may be adapted to sustain large current, i.e. greater than 100mA.<br>
Moreover, the rest of the system may be adapted to withstand the thermal effect<br>
associated with such large current by using passive or active cooling of the electrodes<br>
130 and/or the tube 2 or any other part of the thruster 1. This allows to reach higher<br>
plasma density than lower current discharges. In another embodiment, a part of the heat<br>
removed from some compound of the thruster can be transmitted to the propellant to<br>
either change its state if not already gaseous or increase its thermal energy content hence<br>
its "cold thrust". Such a cooling is called regenerative cooling.<br>
Figure 30 comprises an injector 8 and an ionizer 124. The ionizer 124 of figure 30<br>
comprises at least two electrodes 130 inside the main chamber 6, the said electrodes 130<br>
having different electric potentials, and a seventh magnetic field generator 132, adapted<br>
to generate a seventh magnetic field at least between the at least two electrodes 130.<br>
lonization is improved by applying a seventh magnetic field to the ionizing area, because<br>
the seventh magnetic field makes the electrons gyrate around the magnetic field lines.<br>
Therefore, this increases the length of their path between the electrodes. Thus, this<br>
increases their probability to undergo an ionizing collision. Moreover, the first magnetic<br>
field generated by the first magnetic field generator 12, 14 may be also used as the<br>
seventh magnetic field generated by the seventh magnetic field generator 132.<br>
Figure 31 represents an injector 8 and an ionizer 124. The ionizer 124 of figure 31<br>
is such that the at least two electrodes 130 comprise a ring anode 134 and two ring<br>
Mr<br>
cathodes 136, 138, adapted to be respectively upstream and downstream of the ring<br>
anode 134. A seventh magnetic field generator 132, adapted to generate a seventh<br>
magnetic field at least between the electrodes 134-138 is also represented. This<br>
embodiment is named the Penning Discharge. This arrangement is such that electrons<br>
oscillate between the two cathodes. Thus, the paths of the electrons through the injected<br>
gas are longer. Such an ionizer 124 is described in P.M. Penning, Physica, 4,71,1937.<br>
This embodiment may be combined with an eighth magnetic field generator<br>
adapted both to generate an eighth magnetic field and to create a bottle effect adapted to<br>
increase the intensity of the magnetic field around the cathodes regarding the intensity of<br>
the magnetic field around the anode. In this embodiment, the eighth magnetic field is<br>
non-uniform along the axis 4. This increases ionization. Moreover, the seventh magnetic<br>
field generated by seventh magnetic field generator 132 may be also used as the eighth<br>
magnetic field generated by the eighth magnetic field generator 133. Such an ionizer 124<br>
is described in P.M. Penning, Physica, 4,71, 1937.<br>
Figure 39 represents an ionizer 124. The ionizer 124 of figure 39 is such that the at<br>
least two electrodes 130 comprise two electrodes 130 delivering brief and intense current<br>
impulse along the surface of a solid propellant 160, thus ablating and ionizing a small<br>
layer of propellant 160 at each impulse. Preferably, the electrodes 130 remain in contact<br>
with the solid propellant downstream surface. This contact ensures best coupling<br>
efficiency because more energy is used to vaporise and ionise the propellant 160. For<br>
instance, the ionizer 124 can comprise two railed electrodes 129 parallel to the axis 4 and<br>
positioned along the main chamber 6 along the length of the solid propellant. As the<br>
propellant 160 is consumed, the downstream surface recesses, i.e. moves, toward the<br>
upstream end of the thruster 1. The railed electrodes 13 allows to have electrodes<br>
keeping contact with the downstream surface of the propellant 160. It is also preferred in<br>
this embodiment that such railed electrodes are connected to the generator by their<br>
downstream ends. This ensures that the discharge will more likely occur on the<br>
downstream surface of the solid propellant 160. Indeed, the downstream surface of the<br>
solid propellant 160 will offer a conducting path of lower inductance. Another possible<br>
embodiment would comprise electrodes 130 having a axial length much smaller than the<br>
thruster length, and means for pushing the solid propellant 160 to ensure that the<br>
downstream surface of the solid propellant 160 stay in contact with the electrodes 130.<br>
Figure 32 comprises an injector 8 and an ionizer 124. The ionizer 124 of figure 32<br>
comprises at least one electromagnetic field generator 140 adapted to produce an<br>
alternating electromagnetic field within the main chamber 6. Indeed, it allows to energize<br>
electrons, whether free electrons naturally existing in the gas or provided by an<br>
additional electron emitter 128, by applying them an alternating electric field for instance<br>
in using a coupling antenna, i.e. electrodes 139. Preferably, the frequency of the at least<br>
one electromagnetic field generator 140 is below 2GHz. This allows to avoid<br>
interference problems with the payload, and especially communication means of a<br>
spacecraft comprising the thruster 1.<br>
In the example of figure 33, the at least one electromagnetic field generator 140<br>
comprises capacitively coupled electrodes 142 connected to a high frequency generator<br>
140. Capacitively coupled electrodes 141 are defined as pairs of electrodes 141 having<br>
the different potentials. These capacitively coupled electrodes 141 are connected to a<br>
high frequency power source. In this embodiment, the coupled electrodes 141 are placed<br>
outside of the tube 2 containing the plasma, which then implies a capacitive discharge in<br>
which the electrodes 142 are not subject to any erosion due to particle impact. In the<br>
example of figure 33, there is tone pair 141 of ring coupling electrodes. In this capacitive<br>
discharge, no part needs to be in direct contact with the plasma as the coupling electrodes<br>
141 can be outside the tube 2. Thus it reduces the erosion risk<br>
In the example of figure 34, the at least one electromagnetic field generator 140<br>
comprises an inductively coupled coil 144 connected to a high frequency generator 140.<br>
An alternating field is applied on the ionization area by using a coil fed with an<br>
alternating current. The alternating current creates an alternating magnetic field which<br>
induces an alternating electric field. Similarly to capacitive discharge in this inductive<br>
discharge, no part needs to be in direct contact with the plasma as the coil 144 can be<br>
outside the tube 2. Thus it reduces the erosion risk. Beside the obvious solenoidal<br>
geometry, alternative coils geometry can be used. Such an ionizer 124 is described in<br>
US-A-4 010 400, Hollister, "Light generation by an electrodeless Fluorescent lamp" and<br>
in US-A-5 231 334, Paranjpe, "Plasma source and method of manufacturing".<br>
Both these previous embodiments, i.e. capacitively coupled electrodes 142 and<br>
inductively coupled coil 144, may be improved with a ninth static magnetic field<br>
generated by a ninth magnetic field generator, and preferably when the frequency of the<br>
high frequency electromagnetic generator 140 used is near a plasma characteristic<br>
resonance frequencies such as the ions or electrons cyclotron frequency, the plasma<br>
frequency, the upper and lower hybrid frequencies because the energy transfer becomes<br>
more efficient.<br>
Figure 35 comprises an injector 8 and an ionizer 124. The ionizer 124 of figure 35<br>
comprises at least a helicon antenna 146 connected to a high frequency generator 140.<br>
Figure 34 also comprises a tenth magnetic field generator 148 adapted to generated a<br>
tenth magnetic field generator substantially parallel to the axis 4 of the main chamber 6.<br>
Helicon type antenna and frequency are of interest as they allow to produce high density<br>
plasma. Such an ionizer 124 is described by R.W. Boswell, in "Very efficient Plasma<br>
Generation by whistler waves near the lower hybrid frequency", Plasma Physics and<br>
Controlled Fusion, vol. 26, N° 10, ppl 147-1 162, 1984; by R.W. Boswell, in "Large<br>
Volume high density RF inductively coupled plasma", App. Phys. Lett., vol. 50, p. 1130,<br>
1987; in US-A-4 810 935, R.W. Boswell, "Method and apparatus for producing large<br>
volume magnetoplasmas"; and in US-A-5 146 137, Gesche et al., "Device for the<br>
generation of a plasma". In another embodiment any of the previously described high<br>
frequency ionizer, i.e. capacitve, inductive, resonant or helicon, can use at least one<br>
electron emitter 128 inside the main chamber 6. This has the advantages of making the<br>
initiation of the discharge easier, or / and allowing to reach higher plasma density.<br>
Figure 36 comprises an injector 8 and an ionizer 124. The ionizer 124 of figure 36<br>
comprises at least one radiation source 150 of wavelength smaller than 5mm, and<br>
adapted to focus a beam on a focal spot 152. First, this allows the focal spot diameter to<br>
be smaller than the diameter of the main chamber 6. Thus it allows such a focus diameter<br>
to be smaller than the typical distance between possible focus targets. On the contrary,<br>
i.e. if the wavelength is greater than 5mm the diameter of the main chamber should be<br>
greater than 5 centimetres. This would imply that such a thruster 1 would produce a<br>
lower thrust density. Second, using a wavelength smaller than 5mm also allows to reach<br>
pressure exceeding 1 Giga Pa inside the focal spot even with a radiation source of power<br>
lower than 500W. Such a high pressure is desirable to produce dense plasma.<br>
Furthermore, the lower the power of the radiation source the higher the overall efficiency<br>
of the thruster 1. A radiation source 150 of wavelength smaller than 5mm allows to<br>
produce a field intense enough to ionize and/or produce electron emission inside the<br>
main chamber 6 either inside a volume of the main chamber 6 (this is described in US-A-<br>
3 955 921, Tensmeyer; US-A-4 771 168, Gunderson et al.) or on the tube 2 (this is<br>
described in US-A-5'990'599, Jackson et al.). In the example of figure 36, the focal spot<br>
152 is on the tube 2 surface. There is also a transparent section in the tube 2 to let the<br>
waves pass through the tube 2.<br>
In the example of figure 37, the focal spot 152 is a focal volume within the main<br>
chamber 6; the radiation source 150 comprises a flash lamp radiation source 154, and a<br>
reflector 156. There is also a transparent section 158 in the tube to let the waves pass<br>
through the tube 2.<br>
Figure 37 shows an embodiment, in which a radiation source 150 can be used to<br>
ionize the propellant by focusing a high intensity radiation on a small focal volume 152<br>
inside the main chamber 6 in order to reach high pressure, pressure being defined as<br>
energy per unit volume. For instance, an example can be an intense cylindrical flash bulb<br>
surrounding the main chamber with the tube 2 made of a material mostly transparent to<br>
the wavelengths used (for example quartz for optical and UV wavelengths) in a similar<br>
fashion as those used to excite laser. Such radiation source can also be fitted with<br>
reflectors and / or lenses 156 to enhance the focusing effect. If the wavelength chosen is<br>
such that individual photon energy is equal or greater than ionization energy (mostly UV:<br>
wavelength lower than 450 nm hence of individual energy greater than leV) then either<br>
the propellant can be ionized by photoionization or alternatively the radiation can be also<br>
focused on a solid surface inside the chamber in order to produce electrons by<br>
photoelectric effect. Another possible embodiment of such devices can be to direct a<br>
laser beam on a dedicated surface inside the chamber. This allows to produce plasma<br>
without any material part inside the main chamber 6. This also allows to reduce<br>
impedance adaptation problems or plasma density limit as found in RF and microwave<br>
systems, especially for systems where the plasma diameter size is much larger than the<br>
wavelength. These problems are due to plasma skin depth which induces shielding of the<br>
electromagnetic field. Moreover, the radiation source can be distant from the thruster<br>
and/or even from the spacecraft.<br>
Figure 39 comprises an ionizer 124. The ionizer 124 of figure 39 comprises at least<br>
one radiation source 150 of wavelength smaller than 5mm, and adapted to focus a beam<br>
on a focal spot 152. The ionizer 124 of figure 39 further comprises at least a solid<br>
propellant 160, and the at least one radiation source 150 of figure 39 is adapted to focus<br>
on said solid propellant 160. Indeed, if the radiation intensity is high enough it is possible<br>
design a system in which the propellant (such as Na, Li) could be a stored in solid state<br>
inside the chamber and simultaneously vaporized and ionized by powerful laser impulse<br>
each vaporizing and ionizing a tiny layer of it. This arrangement allows to use any solid<br>
propellant without having to use a dedicated vaporization system and also to obtain<br>
extremely dense pulse of plasma.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, a system comprises at least one tnruster<br>
and at least a microwave power source 1 14 adapted to supply the at least one thruster<br>
with power. Therefore, this allows to use a plurality of thruster together. Each one is<br>
supplied with energy by its own microwave power source 1 14, or by a unique microwave<br>
power source 114 for the plurality of thrusters, or a mixed system. It is also possible for<br>
the system to comprise a controller. Then, when a microwave power source 1 14 is off, or<br>
damaged, or cannot supply a thrust with enough energy, the controller may command<br>
another microwave power source 1 14 to supply this thrust.<br>
The microwave power source 114 can be derived from the one used to allow<br>
microwave communications and or data transfer of a satellite. This allows the thruster to<br>
use a microwave power source 1 14 that exists on most satellites. Indeed, satellites have<br>
such a microwave power source 114 to communicate with Earth or to fulfill another<br>
mission.<br>
Figure 40 is a schematic view of another embodiment of the invention. Figure 39<br>
comprises a system comprising a spacecraft body 120 and at least one thruster 1 adapted<br>
to direct and rotate the spacecraft body 120. This thruster 1 can use thrust vectoring<br>
technology. Three thrusters 1 may be sufficient when arranged on three different sides of<br>
a spacecraft body 120 to allow the spacecraft body 120 to move along any direction and<br>
to rotate also regarding any direction, especially if they use thrust vectoring. When using<br>
two thrusters 1 on two sides of the spacecraft body 120, the thruster may rotate along<br>
only two directions. Yet, it can move along the three directions. This prevents also from<br>
using prior art thrusters which need to be mechanically gimballed on a side of a<br>
spacecraft body.<br>
Process embodiments are deduced from these preceding thruster and system<br>
embodiments. The process embodiments have the same advantages as the thruster and<br>
system embodiments.<br>

fields, or coil-less solutions like the ones disclosed in reference to figures 9-16. One may<br>
also combine the various solutions disclosed for the same purpose, e.g. combine the gas<br>
injection solutions of figures 5, 13, and 18. The currently preferred embodiments<br>

Combinations may also be realized using a ionizer 124 comprising at least an<br>
electromagnetic field generator adapted to generate a microwave ionizing field in the<br>
main chamber 6, the said microwave ionizing field which can be upstream of a<br>
maximum along the axis 4 of a magnetic field generated by a magnetic field generator.<br><br><br><br>
