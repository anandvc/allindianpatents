Title of tho Invention-:<br>
Method of making a decision on the monthly physiological condition of a female body, apparatus which makes such decision, and apparatus which produces some data for such decision.<br>
Field of the Invention:<br>
The present invention relates to a method of making a decision on the monthly physiological condition of a female body, such as ovulation, PMS (premenstrual syndrome), menstruation, fertilizable condition or other female physical conditions which appear in a monthly cycle. Also, it relates to an apparatus which makes a decision on the monthly physiological condition of a female body, and an apparatus which produces some useful data in making such a decision.<br>
Prior Art:<br>
As seen from Fig.1, the monthly physiological condition of a female body is closely related with the basal body temperature as for instance follows: the basal body temperature transfers from the low temperature phase to the high temperature phase on the day of ovulation, and from the high temperature phase to the low temperature phase on the menstruation start day. Women, therefore, measure their basal body temperature with a gynecological thermometer for the purpose when they wake up every morning, so that a record of basal body temperature may be prepared for making a required decision on their physiological conditions.<br><br>
Problems to be solved by the invention:<br>
It, however, takes about five or more minutes to measure their basal body temperature while they lay in bed every day without moving. This is bothersome more or less, and they are apt to fall a sleep before without knowing it, sometimes even oversleeping.<br>
Also, the record of basal body temperature makes it possible as described above to determine only some of physiological condition of a female body, which are usually used for birth control, such as ovulation, menstruation or fertilizable condition. A decision as to whether or not they are suffering PMS cannot be made from the record of basal body temperature. Nowadays women have been increasingly interested in the adverse effect on their daily lives caused by PMS, which are likely to start seven days earlier than the start of menstruation. Some examples of such adverse effect are: headache, restlessness, abdominal pain, edema or other unpleasing condition. As a psychological treatment for PMS their realizing that they are put in condition of "PMS" can reduce effectively their sufferings.<br>
One object of the present invention is to provide a method of making a decision on the monthly physiological condition of a female body, including PMS, thus facilLtating a woman's daily healthcare as well as birth control. Another object of the present invention is to provide an apparatus which makes a decision on the monthly physiological condition of a female body. Still another object is to provide an apparatus which produces some useful data in making such a decision.<br>

Detailed Description of the Invention:<br>
Before entering the description of the present invention the relation between the monthly physiological condition of a female body and the bioelectric impedance (hereinafter referred to as "Bl") of the female body is described.<br>
After making similar tests repeatedly on a plurality of subjects or female bodies, the inventor found that the Bl is correlated closely with the monthly physiological condition, and he had the idea of using the correlation therebetween in making a decision on the monthly physiological condition of a female body. Some accompanying drawings (Figs.l to 8) show examples of measurements , which were conducted on a selected subject when waking up every morning. As for the Bl of the subject it appeared between two selected points on the subject's both feet.<br>
Fig.2 shows how the Bl and the basal body temperature change cyclically. Specifically the curves of the Bl and the basal body temperature are given by plotting the averages of every two adjacent measurements according to the method of moving averages. As a general tendency both the Bl and the basal body temperature vary cyclically, the correlation between these respective cyclical variations being as follows: the basal body temperature remains at low<br><br>
values (called "low temperature phase") while the Bl remains at high values, the Bl remains at low values while the basal body temperature remains at high values (called "high temperature phase"), and the sudden rise and fall of the Bl appear for the relatively short length of time beginning with the start of premenstruum and ending with the end of the first half of the following menstrual period.<br>
Now, the correlation between the weight and the Bl of the selected subject is described by referring to data shown Figs.3 and 4.   While the measurement was conducted on the selected subject the weight continued to change gradually with time, as seen from Fig.3.    Fig.4 shows how the Bl is correlated with the weight.    It can be seen that there is a significant negative correlation between the Bl and the weight (the correlation coefficient "R" being equal to 0.527). Specifically the Bl increases as the weight decreases, or the Bl reduces as the weight increases.   Such correlation may be justly considered to come from the findings or confirmed facts of: first, the water content of the body increasing in 	``proportion to the increase of the weight; and second, the Bl decreasing in proportion to the increase of the water content of the body.     From this recognition it is concluded that the Bl graph of Fig.2 be affected more or less by the contiriuous change of the weight as seen from Fig.3.   To provide a correct graphic representation, therefore, it is necessary to modify the Bl graph of Fig.2 with the weight.<br>
Fig.5 is a graph of Fig.2 modified with weight, showing that the weight-modified Bl and the basal body temperature change cyclically. The measured Bl can be modified with the weight by adding to the measured Bl the decrement of Bl which is proportional inversely to the increment of weight or by subtracting from the measured Bl the increment of the Bl which is proportional inversely to the decrement of the weight, thus eliminating the influence on the graphic representation by the continuous change of the weight.   Such weight-modified<br><br>
Bl can be calculated from the following equation 1 or 2: weight-modified BI=BI+AX difference of weight from the first weight     (1)   or weight-modified BI=BI+B x difference of weight from the preceding weight (2), where A and B stand for modification coefficients.   Comparison with Fig.2 reveals that the graphic representation of Fig.5 is conspicuous by its cyclic change of the Bl, which curve is now free of the influence by the weight change. Next, the manner in which the Bl, the basal body temperature and the PMS are correlated is described.   As seen from Figs.2 and 5, in general, the Bl exhibits high values during the low temperature phase, and exhibits low values during the high temperature phase.   As a noticeable change, the Bl exhibits low values for the extra period beginning with the start of the premenstruum and ending with the end of the first half of the following menstrual period.    The extra period is a substantial part of the low temperature phase of the basal body temperature.   In the low temperature phase there appear two peaks and the intervening valley point in the Bl curve, implying that the basal body temperature is not substantially correlated with the Bl.    The least correlation between the basal body temperature and the Bl can be confirmed from Fig.6 (correlation coefficient R=0.424).<br>
Low values of the Bl appearing for the extra period of the low temperature phase may be justly attributable to the fact that the female body contains as much water as the edema appears, the edema is getting worse as the water content increases, and accordingly the Bl decreases. Thus, the Bl appears to be closely related with the edema: the Bl exhibits low values when the edema appears, and the Bl exhibits high values when the edema disappears. Observation of the Bl over an elongated term permits the making of a decision on the subject suffering from the edema. Such decision has been hitherto impossible so far as the measurement of the basal body temperature is used. Also, it is well known that the edema appearing in the premenstruum has a close<br><br>
connection with PMS: the edema is getting worse, and the PMS is getting worse in unison. This suggests that a decision on the suffering from PMS be made on the basis of the continuous change of the BL<br>
Next, reference is made to Figs.7 and 8, describing the relation between the weight-modified Bl (or the Bl) and the monthly physiological condition of the selected female body.   These figures definitely show that the weight-modified Bl curve varies cyclically, and that it is so related with the monthly physiological condition of the female body that a decision on the monthly physiological condition of the female body may be made on the basis of the continuous change of the weight-modified Bl curve.    Specifically the high-to-low value transition of weight-modified Bl appearing at the boundary between the low temperature phase and the high temperature phase indicates that the ovulation has occurred.   The high-to-low value transition of weight-modified Bl is followed by the level off-and-sudden rise of the weight-modified Bl.   The sudden rise shows entrance into the premenstruum, indicating that the edema and the PMS appear soon.    The sudden rise is followed by the sudden fall, which indicates the start of menstruation.    The sudden fall is followed by the gradual rise-and-level off.   The gradual rise indicates the end of PMS, and the beginning of the level-off indicates the end of menstruation.<br>
The same inclination as described above with respect to one selected subject was observed in each of the other subjects, and may be presumably observed in women in general. In the experiments the Bl appearing between two selected points on both feet of each subject was measured. Other Bis measured between two points selected on a female body can be used equally, but the Bl appearing between two selected points on both feet shows a clearly discernible cyclic change compared with other Bis, thus facilitating the making of a decision on physiological condition of a female body.<br>
Now, an apparatus which makes a decision on the monthly physiological<br><br>
condition of a female body according to a first embodiment of the present invention is described.<br>
Referring to Fig.9 the decision making apparatus comprises a weighing scale type of bioloelectric impedance meter 20, and a control box 40 connected to the bioloelectric impedance meter 20 via a cable 30. Instead of the cable 30, wireless communication such as infrared communication may be used.<br>
The bioelectric impedance meter 20 has a pair of constant-current applying electrodes 21a and 21b and a pair of voltage measuring electrodes 22a and 22b applied to its top surface. The control box 40 has a display screen 42a on its front. The display screen 42a includes an advisory message display area 42b. On the front of the control box 40 there appear a set of operation keys, including an power switch 41a, a measurement-start-command inputting key 41b, a scroll-up key 41c, a scroll-down key 41 d, a menstruation-start-day inputting key 41 e, and a menstruation-end-day inputting key 411<br>
Fig. 10 illustrates the arrangement of major elements of the decision making apparatus of Fig.9. As shown, the bioelectric impedance meter 20 comprises: a high-frequency constant current circuit 23 which supplies the pair of constant current applying electrodes 21a and 21b with a weak constant current; a voltagemeasuring circuit 24 which measures the voltage between the opposite voltage measuring electrodes 22a and 22b; a weight meter which measures the weight of a subject 25; and an A/D converter 28 which converts analog voltage-and weight-representative signals in digital form.<br>
The control box 40 comprises a data input device 41 including the operation keys 41a to 41f as described above, a display device 42, a timer 43, a memory 44 and a CPU 45. The display device 42 is capable of showing the measured Bl curve, the determined monthly physiological condition, and so forth on its display screen 42a. The timer 43 is used in determining at what time or day the measurement is conducted.   The memory 44 stores the measured Bis,<br><br>
the time and date on which a required measurement is made, and so forth. Finally, the CPU 45 makes a decision on the monthly physiological condition of a female body on the basis of the menstrual period data inputted at Steps 10 to 14 (later described), the measured Bis, the weights and other data. Also, the CPU controls the memory 44, the display device 42 and other components in the coordinated way.<br>
Some selected components may be changed in position, as for instance the CPU 45 is shifted to the bioelectric impedance meter 20, The weighing scale type of bioelectric impedance meter 20 may be so designed as to incorporate the control box 40, as in a decision making apparatus according to a second embodiment (later described).<br>
Next, a method of making a decision on the monthly physiological condition according to the present invention is described below by referring to the manner in which the decision making apparatus just described works accordingly.<br>
Fig.11 is a flowchart illustrating a series of actions for making a required decision. At Step 1 a subject depresses the power switch 41a to turn the decision making apparatus 10 on. At Step 2 depression of the measuring switch 41_b allows the proceeding to go to Step 3, in which the decision making apparatus is put in the measuring mode. The measuring switch 41b being not depressed, the proceeding is allowed to go to Step 10 in which the decision making apparatus is put in the data-presetting mode in which the menstrual length of time is inputted and recorded for the use of decision making.<br>
At Step 3 the decision making apparatus starts working in the measuring mode. The subject stands on the bioelectric impedance meter 20, the toes and balls of both feet being laid on the opposite constant-current Applying electrodes 21a and 21b, and the heels of both feet being laid on the opposite voltage measuring electrodes 22a and 22b.   The weight meter 25 is responsive to the<br><br>
weight for measuring it automatically. At Step 4 a weak constant current is directed from the high-frequency constant current circuit 23 to both toes and balls via the opposite constant-current applying electrodes 21a and 21b, thus allowing the constant current to flow between both legs through the abdominal region. Then, the voltage appearing between the opposite voltage measuring electrodes 22a and 22b is determined, and the Bl is calculated from the so determined voltage and the current flowing in the abdominal part of the subject. At Step 5 the Bl thus obtained is modified according to either equation as described above, thereby normalizing the Bl with respect to a given reference value of weight. Thus, the weight-modified Bl is free of the influence by the present weight change.<br>
At Step 6 a decision as to which monthly physiological condition of the female body the subject has been in, as for instances, she has been in ovulatory condition or has been suffering from PMS, is made from the present weight-modified Bl (as measured at Step 5) and from the record both of the previous weight-modified Bl and the menstrual lengths of time (retrieved from the memory 44) in the light of the correlation between the weight modified Bl curve and the monthly physiological condition of a female body.   At Step 7 the weight modified Bl curve and other data appear in the display screen 42a.   Specifically, the so made decision and the advisory message pertaining thereto appear on the advisory display area 42b.    Some examples of the decisions appearing in the display  are:   physical   conditions   such   as   ovulation,   PMS,   menstruation, fertilizable condifion, and edema, and accompanying mental conditions such as a feeling of unhealthy condition or of restlessness.   As one example of the advisory message the manner of living, including dieting is advised as for instance follows:<br>
"you are involved in premenstruum, so that you may suffer from PMS and edema.    Calm yourself lest you should be impatient.    Take Vitamin B rich<br><br>
foods.";<br>
"You are in menstrual period. You will get rid of the unpleasant condition soon.   Take enough iron lest you should be anemia.";<br>
"Menstrual period has finished, and you are now in the best physical condition.   You had better take good exercise,"; or<br>
"You are involved in the ovulatory period, and you are pleasing less and less.    Don't overeat yourself."<br>
At Step 8 the weight-modified Bl, the weight and so on, which are measured this time, are stored in the memory 44. Subsequently at Step 9 the decision making apparatus 10 turns off automatically, thus finishing the series of measurements.<br>
As described above, if the measuring switch 41b is not depressed at Step 2, the proceeding is allowed to go to Step 10, in which the decision making apparatus is put in the data-presetting mode in which the menstrual length of time is inputted and recorded for use of decision making.<br>
At Step 10 the starting or ending date of the menstrual period is selected by depressing the scroll-up key 41c or the scroll-down key 41 d. Assume that the starting date of the menstrual period is selected, and then, at Step 11 the menstruation-start-day inputting key 41 e is depressed to allow the proceeding to go to Step 12, where the starting date of the menstrual period selected at Step 10 is stored in the memory 44.<br>
Assume that the ending date of the menstrual period is selected at Step 10, and then, at Step 11 the menstruation-start-day inputting key 41 e is not depressed to allow the proceeding to go to Step 13. There, the menstruation-end-day key 41 f is depressed to allow the proceeding to go to Step 14, permitting the ending date of the menstrual period to be stored in the memory 44.<br>
Subsequent to the action taken at Step 12 or 14 or in the negative outcome<br><br>
at Step 13 the proceeding goes to Step 9 wherein the decision making apparatus 10 turns off automatically, terminating the inputting of data.<br>
Next, a decision making apparatus according to a second embodiment of the present invention is described.   Referring to Fig. 12, the decision making apparatus 50 is different from the decision making apparatus 10 of Fig.9 in that: the decision making apparatus 50 has its control box built therein, such a control box 40 being physically separated from the weighing scale type apparatus 20 in Fig.9; and the decision making apparatus 50 permits body temperature to be measured.   The decision making apparatus 50 has a pair of constant-current applying electrodes 51a and 51b, a pair of voltage measuring electrodes 52a and 52b, an operation button 53, and a display screen 54 arranged on its top surface. Each   constant-current  applying   electrode 51a  or  51b  has  a  temperature measuring sensor 55a or 55b on its front side.   The subject can measure her temperature by pinching each sensor between the large and adjacent toes of each foot.   Any other temperature meterwhich measures the temperature of the subject may be used.   For example, a measuring-at-ear type of thermometer may be used by communicating with the decision making apparatus 50 via infrared rays.   A sublingual measuring type of gynecological thermometer may be used for measurement of the temperature with precision.   When a decision is made on the monthly physiological condition of a female body, relying on the Bl along with the so measured temperature, such decision is more reliable than that made with recourse to the Bl alone.<br>
While embodiments of the present invention have been described above, the present invention should not be understood as being restricted thereto. The Bl appearing between two selected points on both feet is measured in the above embodiments, but the Bl appearing elsewhere may be measured, for example between two selected points on both hands, or either hand and either foot.<br>
The decision making apparatus may be so modified as to permit an<br><br>
access to the memory for retrieving some data pertaining to a selected subject among others, thereby allowing a plurality of subjects to use one and same decision making apparatus in common.<br>
Also, the decision making apparatus may be so modified as to determine the body fat percentage in terms of the measured Bl, showing it in the display. Furthermore, the body temperature, the weight and other factors used in making a decision on the monthly physiological condition of a female body may be displayed. This single decision making apparatus thus modified can perform a variety of functions useful for healthcare, including those functions which have been performed hitherto by different conventional apparatuses such as a weighing scale, a thermometer and a body fat meter.<br>
Advantages:<br>
As may be understood from the above, the decision making method and apparatus using the Bl as the major factor can make a required decision much quicker and easier than the conventional method and apparatus using the body temperature as the major factor, taking say several seconds to several tens of seconds. Also, there is no worry about falling a sleep unconsciously as would often occur in the conventional way wherein the subject needs to lay in bed without moving only for the sake of measuring one's basal body temperature. In contrast the Bl can be measured while the subject is standing. Thanks to use of the Bl as the major factor the decision making method and apparatus can be applied to diagnoses of PMS. Thus, the decision making method and apparatus facilitate a woman's daily healthcare as well as birth control, which the application of the conventional method and apparatus has been limited to.<br>
The reliability of the decision making can be improved by adding extra factors of weight and body temperature to the major factor of Bl. Still another advantage of the decision making apparatus is that it can be modified to display<br><br>
the body temperature or the weight or to determine the body fat percentage in terms of the measured Bl to be able to display this information, whereby this single apparatus alone can perform a variety of functions useful for healthcare, including those functions which have been performed hitherto by different conventional apparatuses such as a weighing scale, a thermometer and a body fat meter.<br><br><br><br>
WE CLAIM :<br>
1. An apparatus for making a decision on the monthly physiological condition of a female body characterized in that it comprises pairs of . electrodes for applying to selected points of the outer layer of the skin of the female body; a bioelectric impedance meter for measuring the bioelectric impedance appearing between one of said pairs of electrodes; a weight meter for measuring the weight of the female body; a processor for making a modification of each bioelectric impedance in terms of the weight; a memory for storing a historical record of weight-modified bioelectric impedance; a decision making unit for making a required decision on the physiological condition of the female body by comparing the present weight-modified bioelectric impedance with the historical record of weight-modified bioelectric impedance; and a display unit for displaying the result of the decision thus made.<br>
2.	The apparatus as claimed in claim 1, wherein said display unit is configured to display the present weight of the female body.<br>
3.	The apparatus as claimed in claim 1 or 2, comprises a temperature meter for measuring the temperature of the female body and a memory for storing a historical record of the temperature, thus permitting said decision making unit to make a required decision by comparing the present temperature with the historical record of temperature in addition to the comparison of the present weight-modified bioelectric impedance with the historical record of weight- modified bioelectric impedance.<br><br>
 The apparatus as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 3, comprises an input device for inputting extra data pertaining to the menstrual period, thus permitting said decision making unit to take such extra data into account.<br>
 The apparatus as claimed in claims 1 to 4, wherein said display unit has provision to show an advisory message pertaining to the decision on the monthly physiological condition.<br>
6.	The apparatus as claimed in claims 1 to 5, comprises an arithmetic unit for determining a body fat percentage in terms of the bioelectric impedance, said display unit has provision to show the body fat percentage thus determined,<br>
7.	An apparatus for making a decision on the monthly physiological condition of a female body, substantially as herein described with reference to the accompanying drawings.<br>
