This invention relates to novel mutant protease enzymes or enzyme variants useful in formulating detergent compositions and exhibiting increased autoproteolytic stability; cleaning and detergent compositions containing said enzymes; mutated genes coding for the expression of said enzymes when inserted into a suitable host cell or organism; and such host cells transformed therewith and capable of expressing said enzyme variants.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
In the detergent industry enzymes have for more than 30 years been implemented in washing formulations. Enzymes used in such formulations comprise proteases, lipases, amylases, cellulases, as well as other enzymes, or mixtures thereof. Commercially most important enzymes are proteases.<br>
Although proteases have been used in the detergent industry for more than 30 years, much remains unknown as to details of how these enzymes interact with substrates and/or other substances present in e.g. detergent compositions. Some factors related to specific residues of the proteases and influencing certain properties, such as oxidative and thermal stability in general, of the proteases have been elucidated, but much remains to be found out. Also, it is still not exactly known which physical or chemical characteristics are responsible for a good washing performance or stability of a protease in a specific detergent composition.<br>
The currently used proteases have for the most part been found by isolating proteases from nature and testing them in detergent formulations.<br>
At present at least the following proteases are known to be commercially available and many of them are marketed in large quantities in many countries of the world.<br><br>
Subtilisin BPN® or Novo (available from e.g. SIGMA, St. Louis, U.S.A.), and Subtilisin Carlsberg, ALCALASE® (NOVO NORDISK A/S)) and MAXATASE® (Genencor) .<br>
A Bacillus lentus subtilisin, subtilisin 309, marketed by NOVO NORDISK A/S as SAVINASE®. A protein engineered variant of this enzyme is marketed as DURAZYM*.<br>
Enzymes closely resembling SAVINASE®, such as subtilisin<br>
9<br>
PB92, MAXACAL marketed by Genencor Inc. (a protein engineered variant of this enzyme is marketed as MAXAPEM*) , OPTICLEAN* marketed by SOLVAY et Cie. and PURAFECT® marketed by GENENCOR International.<br>
A Bacillus lentus subtilisin, subtilisin 147, marketed by NOVO NORDISK A/S as ESPERASE®;<br>
An increasing number of commercially used proteases are protein engineered variants of naturally occurring wild type proteases, e.g. DURAZYM® (Novo Nordisk A/S), RELASE" (NOVO Nordisk A/S), MAXAPEM® (Gist-Brocades N.V.), PURAFECT® (Genencor International, Inc.).<br>
Therefore, an object of the present invention, is to provide improved protein engineered protease variants, especially for use in the detergent industry.<br>
PROTEASES<br>
Enzymes cleaving the amide linkages in protein siobstrates are classified as proteases, or (interchangeably) peptidases (see Walsh, 1979, Enzymatic Reaction Mechanisms. W.H. Freeman and Company, San Francisco, Chapter 3) . Bacteria of the Bacillus species secrete two extracellular types of protease, neutral proteases (or metalloproteases) , and alkaline proteases among which the most important functionally is a serine endopeptidase and usually referred to as subtilisin.<br>
SERINE PROTEASES<br>
A serine protease is an enzyme which catalyzes the hydrolysis of peptide bonds, and in which there is an essential serine residue at the active site (White, Handler and Smith, 1973 "Principles of<br><br>
Biochemistry," Fifth Edition, McGraw-Hill Book Company, NY, pp. 271-272).<br>
The bacterial serine proteases have molecular weights in the 20,000 to 45,000 Daltons range. They are inhibited by diisopropylfluorophosphate. They hydrolyze simple terminal esters and are similar in activity to eukaryotic chymotrypsin, also a serine protease. A more narrow term, alkaline protease, covering a sub-group, reflects the high.pH optimum of some of the serine proteases, from pH 9.0 to 11.0 (for review, see Priest (1977) Bacteriological    Rev.  41 711-753) .<br>
SUBTILASES<br>
A sub-group of the serine proteases tentatively designated sub-tilases has been proposed by Siezen et al., Protein Engng, 4 (1991) 719-737. They are defined by homology analysis of more than 40 amino acid sequences of serine proteases previously referred to as subtilisin-like proteases. A subtilisin was previously defined as a serine protease produced by Gram-positive bacteria or fungi, and according to Siezen et al. now is a subgroup of the subtilases. A wide variety of subtilisins have been identified, and the amino acid sequence of a number of subtilisins have been determined. These include more than six subtilisins from Bacillus strains, namely, subtilisin 168, subtilisin BPN' , subtilisin Carlsberg, subtilisin Y, subtilisin amylosacchariticus, and mesentericopeptidase (Kurihara et al. (1972) J. Biol. Chem. 247 5629-5631; Wells et al. (1983) Nucleic Acids Res. 11 7911-7925; Stahl and Ferrari (1984) J. Bacterid. 159 811-819, Jacobs et al. (1985) Nucl. Acids Res. 13 8913-8926; Nedkov et al. (1985) Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler 366 421-430, Svendsen et al. (1986) FEBS Lett. 196 228-232), one subtilisin from an actinomycetales, thermitase from Therwoactinomyces vulgaris (Meloun et al. (1985) FEBS Lett. 198 195-200), and one fungal subtilisin, proteinase K from Tritirachiuin album (Jany and Mayer (1985) Biol.Chem. Hoppe-Seyler 366 584-492) . for further reference Table I from Siezen et al.  has been reproduced below.<br>
Subtilisins  are  well-characterized  physically  and chemically. In addition to knowledge of the primary structure<br><br>
(amino acid sequence) of these enzymes, over 50 high resolution X-ray structures of subtilisins have been determined which delineate the binding of substrate, transition state, products, at least three different protease inhibitors, and define the structural consequences for natural variation (Kraut (1977) Ann. Rev.   Biochem,   46 331-358).<br>
One subgroup of the subtilases,  I-Sl,  comprises the "classical" subtilisins, such as subtilisin 168, subtilisin BPN', subtilisin  Carlsberg  (ALCALASE',  NOVO  NORDISK  A/S) ,  and subtilisin DY.<br>
A further subgroup of the subtilases I-S2, is recognised by Siezen et al. {supra). Sub-group I-S2 proteases are described as highly alkaline subtilisins and comprise enzymes such as subtilisin PB92 (MAXACAL*, Gist-Brocades NV), subtilisin 309 (SAVINASE*, NOVO NORDISK A/S), subtilisin 147 (ESPERASE*, NOVO NORDISK A/S), and alkaline elastase YaB.<br>
Random and site-directed mutations of the subtilase gene have both arisen from knowledge of the physical and chemical properties of the enzyme and contributed information relating to subtilase's catalytic activity, substrate specificity, tertiary structure, etc. (Wells et al. (1987) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 84; 1219-1223; Wells et al. (1986) Phil. Trans. R. Soc. Lond.A. 317 415-423; Hwang and Warshel (1987) Biochem. 26 2669-2673; Rao et al.,    (1987) Nature  328 551-554.<br>
More recent publications covering this area are Carter et al. (1989) Proteins 6 240-248 relating to design of variants that cleave a specific target sequence in a substrate (positions 24 and 64); Graycar et al. (1992) Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences 672 71-79 discussing a number of previously published results; and Takagi (1993) Int. J. Biochem. 25 307-312 also reviewing previous results.<br>
Especially site-directed mutagenesis of the subtilisin genes has attracted much attention, and various mutations are described in the following patent applications and patents:<br><br>
PREVIOUSLY CHARACTERIZED PROTEASE VARIANTS<br>
Numerous references describe construction of Protease variants. In order to make it easier to get an overview of the overall prior art status, the references are ordered in two<br>
sections.<br>
Section one deals with references describing the technological background and identification of Protease variants presently not believed to be related to the variants disclosed in the present invention. Those references are mainly included in order to summarize the state of the art within the field of construction  of  protease  variants  for  different  purposes.<br>
Section two deals with references describing identification of Protease variants believed to be of some relevance to the variants of the present invention.<br>
References summarizing the state of the art (Section 1):<br>
EP 130756 (GENENTECH)(corresponding to US Reissue Patent No. 34,606 (GENENCOR)) relating to site specific or randomly generated mutations in "carbonyl hydrolases" and subsequent screening of the mutated enzymes for various properties, such as kcat/Km ratio, pH-activity profile, and oxidation stability. This publication claims site-specific mutation of subtilisins BPN' in<br><br>

WO 95/3 0011, WO 95/30010, and WO 95/2997 9 (PROCTER &amp; GAMBLE COMPANY) describe 6 regions, especially position 199-220 (BPN' numbering), in both Subtilisin BPN' and subtilisin 309, which are designed to change (i.e. decrease) the adsorption of the enzyme to surface-bound soils. It is suggested that decreased adsorption by an enzyme to a substrate results in better detergent cleaning performance. No data on any variants or specific detergent wash performance data are provided.<br>
Previously characterized protease variants having some relevance to the present invention, (section two):<br>
In EP 251 446 (GENENCOR) it is described how homology considerations at both primary and tertiary structural levels may be applied to identify equivalent amino acid residues whether conserved or not. It is claimed that this information together with the inventors knowledge of the tertiary structure of subtilisin BPN' brought the inventors to select a number of positions susceptible to mutation with an expectation of obtaining mutants with altered properties. The positions so<br><br><br>
Especially of interest for the purpose of the present invention the inventors of EP 251 446 suggest to substitute 170Lys (in subtilisin BPN', type I-Sl), specifically they suggest to introduce Glu or Arg for the original Lys. It appears that the Glu variant was produced and it was found that it was highly susceptible to autolytic degradation (cf. pages 48, 121, 123 (Table XXI includes an obvious error, but indicates a reduction in autolysis half-time from 86 to 13 minutes) and Fig. 32).<br>
In WO 89/06279 (NOVO NORDISK A/S) position 170 is indicated as interesting and it is suggested to replace the existing residue with Tyr. However, no data are given in respect of such a variant. In WO 91/00345 (NOVO NORDISK A/S) the same suggestion is made, and it is shown that the Tyr variant of position 170 in subtilisin 309 (type I-S2) exhibits an improved wash performance in detergents at a pH of about 8 (variant S003 in Tables III, IV, V, VI, VIII, X). The same substitution in combination with other substitutions in other positions also indicates an improved wash performance(S004, S011-S014, S022-S024, S019, S020, S203, S225, S227 in the same Table and Table VII) all in accordance with the generic concept of said application.<br>
In EP 525 610 Al (SOLVAY) it is suggested to improve the stability of the enzyme (a type I-S2 subtilase closely related to subtilisin PB92) towards ionic tensides by decreasing the hydrophobicity in certain surface regions thereof. It is suggested to substitute Gin for the Arg in position 164 (170 if using BPN' numbering). No variants comprising this substitution are disclosed in the application.<br>
In WO 94/02618 (GIST-BROCADES N.V.) a number of position 164 (170 if using BPN® numbering) variants of the I-S2 type subtilisin PB92 are described. Examples are provided showing substitution of Met, Val, Tyr, and lie for the original Arg. Wash performance testing in powder detergents of the variants indicates a slight improvement. Especially for the Ile variant wash performance tests on cacao an improvement of about 20-3 0% is indicated. No stability data are provided.<br><br>
In PCT/DK96/00207 (not yet published) a number of protease variants with improved wash performance and/or storage stability is described.<br>
It was found that subtilase variants with improved wash performance can by obtained by substituting one or more amino acid residues situated in, or in the vicinity of a hydrophobic domain of the parent subtilase for an amino acid residue more hydrophobic, than the original residue, said hydrophobic domain comprising the residues corresponding to residues 1165, Y167, Y171 of BLS309 (in BASBPN numbering) , and said residues in the vicinity thereof comprising residues corresponding to the residues E136, G159, S164, R170, A194, and G195 of BLS309 (in BASBPN numbering) (PCT/DK96/00207).<br>
US 5.543.302 describes the identification of important autoproteolytic cleavage site in different wild type proteases (MILEZYME®, SAVINASE®, and ESPERASE®) .<br>
The present invention focuses on specific protease variants influencing the position of autoproteolytic cleavage sites in a group of protease variants described in our pending patent application PCT/DK96/00207. The variants of the present invention have surprisingly been found to exhibit an altered autoproteolytic degradation pattern compared to the autoproteolytic degradation pattern described for corresponding wildtype proteases in US 5.543.302.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
It has now surprisingly been found that subtilase variants having modification(s) in one or more amino acid residues situated in positions corresponding to residues P129, P131, E136, G159, S164, 1165, Y167, R170, Y171 of BLS309 (in BASBPN numbering), have an altered autoproteolytic degradation pattern, as compared to the corresponding wildtype. The primary alteration is an autolytic cleavage site apparently located between residues 132-133 (in BASBPN numbering) .<br>
SAVINASE® is known to have a broad substrate specificity and will upon extensive incubation auto cleavage itself at<br><br>
numerous sites. However the initial 1-5 cleavage sites (primary-sites) are of highest relevance for industrial applications of the subtilase proteases.<br>
Said autolytic cleavage site located between residues 132-133 is presently believed to be a new primary autoproteolytic cleavage site. This is presently believed to be the first time that this autoproteolytic cleavage site has been identified, as a primary autoproteolytic cleavage site, in a subtilase protease enzyme. For further details reference is made to a working example herein {vide infra).<br>
Consequently in its first aspect, the present invention relates to a subtilase enzyme variant characterized by being derived from a precursor subtilase enzyme having an autoproteolytic split site between residues 132 and 133 (in BASBPN numbering), which further has been modified by substitution, insertion or deletion at or in one or more of the residues situated in positions corresponding to residues 12 9, 13 0, 131, 132, 133, 134, 135, 136 of BLS309 (in BASBPN numbering); whereby said variant exhibits increased autoproteolytic stability relative to said precursor subtilase enzyme.<br>
In a second aspect the invention relates a subtilase enzyme variant characterized by being derived from a precursor subtilase enzyme variant having modification(s) in one or more am.ino acid residues situated in positions corresponding to residues G159, S164, 1165, Y167, R170, Y171 of BLS309 (in BASBPN numbering); which further has been modified by substitution, insertion or deletion at or in one or more of the residues situated in positions corresponding to residues 129, 130, 131, 132, 133, 134, 135, 136 (in BASBPN numbering); whereby said variants exhibit increased autoproteolytic stability relative to :he precursor subtilase variant which is not modified at any of 3aid positions 129-136.<br>
US 5.543.302 teaches that SAVINASE® has a autoproteolytic cleavage site located between residues 192-193 (in BASBPN numbering) and suggests to make modifications in a ?road region around this site (between residue 180-210) in order :o obtain a variant with increased autoproteolytic stability.<br><br>
The present inventors have confirmed this autoproteolytic site between residues 192-193 (in BASBPN numbering) in both SAVINASE® and SAVINASE® variants having modification(s) in one or more amino acid residues situated in positions corresponding to residues P129, P131, E136, G159, S164, 1165, Y167, R170, Y171 of BLS309 (in BASBPN numbering). The present inventors suggest specific modifications (mutations), in the vicinity of the autoproteolytic site between residues 192-193 (in BASBPN numbering), such as S190P, and G193A (in BASBPN numbering).<br>
Such specific mutations are not discussed or indicated in US 5.543.302, where only a rather broad region (between residues 180-210) is described and no specific mutation resulting in increased autoproteolytic stability is disclosed in US 5.5453.302.<br>
For further details reference is made to a working example herein {vide infra).<br>
Accordingly, in a third aspect the invention relates to a subtilase enzyme variant characterized by being derived from a precursor subtilase enzyme having an autoproteolytic split site between residues 192 and 193 (in BASBPN numbering), which further has been modified by substitution, insertion or deletion at or in one or more of the residues situated in positions corresponding to residues 189, 190, 191, 192, 193, 194, 195, 196 (in BASBPN numbering); whereby said variant exhibits increased autoproteolytic stability relative to said precursor siibtilase enzyme.<br>
In a fourth aspect the invention relates to a sxibtilase enzyme variant characterized by being derived from a precursor subtilase enzyme variant having modification(s) in one or more amino acid residues situated in positions corresponding to residues residues P129, P131, E136, G159, S164, 1165, Y167, R170, Y171 of BLS309 (in BASBPN numbering) which further has been modified by substitution, insertion or deletion at or in one or more of the residues situated in positions corresponding to residues 189, 190, 191, 192, 193, 194, 195, 196 of BLS3 09 (in BASBPN numbering);  whereby  said variants  exhibit  increased<br><br>
autoproteolytic stability relative to the precursor subtilase variant which is not modified at any of said positions 189-196.<br>
In  a  further aspect  the  invention relates  to DNA constructs capable of expressing the enzymes of the invention, when inserted in a suitable manner into a host cell that subsequently is brought to express the subtilisin enzyme(s) of the first aspect.<br>
In a further aspect the invention relates to the production of the subtilisin enzymes of the invention by inserting a DNA construct according to the second aspect into a suitable host, cultivating the host to express the desired subtilase enzyme, and recovering the enzyme product.<br>
The invention relates, in part/ but is not limited to, mutants of the genes expressing the subtilase sub-group I-S2 enzymes and the corresponding enzyme variants, as indicated above.<br>
Other subtilase gene variants encompassed by the invention are such as those of the subtilase subgroup I-Sl, e.g. Subtilisin BPN', and Subtilisin Carlsberg genes and ensuing variant Subtilisin BPN', Proteinase K, and Subtilisin Carlsberg enzymes, which exhibit improved stability in concentrated liquid detergents.<br>
Still further subtilase gene variants encompassed by the invention are such as Proteinase K and other genes and ensuing variant Proteinase K, and other subtilase enzymes, which exhibit improved stability in concentrated liquid detergents.<br>
Other examples of parent subtilase enzymes that can be modified in accordance with the invention are listed in Table I.<br>
Further the invention relates to the use of the mutant enzymes in cleaning compositions and cleaning compositions comprising the mutant enzymes, especially detergent compositions comprising the mutant subtilisin enzymes.<br>
According to the invention such detergent compositions may furthermore comprise one or more other enzymes, such as lipases, cellulases, amylases, etc.<br><br>
Accordingly the present invention proviles a subtilase enzyme variant derived from a precursor subtilase enzyme having an autoproteolytic split site between residues 132 and 133 (in BASBPN numbering), which has been modified by substitution, insertion or deletion at or in one or more of the residues situated in positions corresponding to residues 129, 130, 131, 132, 133, 134, 135, 136 (in BASBPN numbering); and at or in<br>
a)	one or more of the residues situated in positions corresponding to residues 159, 164, 165, 167, 170, 171 (in BASBPN numbering); or<br>
b)	one or more of the residues situated in positions corresponding to residues 189, 190, 191,192,193,194, 195,196 (in BASBPN numbering).<br><br>

VARIANTS<br>
In describing the various enzyme variants produced or contemplated according to the invention, the following nomenclatures have been adapted for ease of reference;<br><br>
Original amino acid(s) position(s) substituted amino acid(s)<br>
According to this the substitution of Glutamic acid for glycine in position 195 is designated as:<br>
Gly 195 Glu    or   G195E a deletion of glycine in the same position is:<br>
Gly 195 *      or   G195* and insertion of an additional-amino acid residue such as lysine is:<br>
Gly 195 GlyLys or  G195GK<br>
Where a deletion in comparison with the sequence used for the numbering is indicated, an insertion in such a position is indicated as:<br>
* 36 Asp      or   *36D for insertion of an aspartic acid in position 36<br>
Multiple mutations are separated by pluses, i.e.: Arg 170 Tyr + Gly 195 Glu or R170Y+G195E representing mutations' in positions 170 and 195 substituting tyrosine and glutamic acid for arginine and glycine, respectively.<br>
POSITIONS<br>
In describing the variants in this application and in the<br>
appended claims use is made of the alignment of various subti-<br>
lases in Siezen et al., Supra. In other publications relating to subtilases other alignments or the numbering of specific enzymes have been used. It is a routine matter for the skilled person to establish the position of a specific residue in the numbering used here. Reference is also made to Fig. 1 showing an alignment of residues relevant for the present invention from a large number of subtilases. Reference is also made to Table I of WO 91/00345 showing an alignment of residues relevant for the present invention from a number of subtilases.<br><br>

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES<br>
Fig. 1 shows an alignment of a number of the subtilases mentioned in Table I.<br>
DEFINITONS<br>
Prior to discussing this  invention in further detail,  the following term will first be defined.<br>
"Altered autolytic stability" The term "altered autolytic stability" or "altering autolytic stability" is intended to mean increasing or decreasing the autolytic stability compared to that of the original protease.<br>
"Altered autoproteolytic degradation sites" The term "altered autoproteolytic degradation sites" is intended to indicate altered autoproteolytic degradation sites over those of the original protease. The alteration may be a formation of a completely new site or the removal of a site in the original protease. The term "altered autoproteolytic degradation sites" is also intended to indicate alterations where an autoproteolytic site which is not a e.gr. primary or secondary cleavage site in the original protease after alteration of the degradation pattern turns out to a e.g. a primary or a secondary autoproteolytic site.<br>
"Autoproteolytic cleavage site" The term autoproteolytic cleavage site is used to indicate a site of the protease where the autoproteolysis of the protease is believed to take place. This site could e.g. be defined as being located between amino acid residues X and Y.<br>
Cleavage sites can be identified by preparing an aqueous solution of a protease; rapidly inactivating the protease to prevent progressive degradation of peptide fragments produced by autolysis; separating the peptide fragments under conditions which prevent reactivation of the protease; and identifying the N-terminal amino acids of the separated fragments. For further details reference is made to a working example herein (vide infra) .<br><br>
The term "autoproteolytic cleavage site" may alternatively be called "autoproteolytic split site".<br>
"Primary autoproteolytic cleavage site" The term 'primary autoproteolytic cleavage site" is intended to mean the first 1-5 initial cleavage site(s) where the protease auto cleavage itself. "Modification(s) of a subtilase variant" The term "modification(s)" used in connection with modification(s) of a subtilase variant as discussed herein is defined to include chemical modification as well as genetic manipulation to reduce the rate of autolytic degradation. The modification(s) can be by substitution, deletion and/or insertions in or at the amino acid(s) of interest.<br>
When the term "modif ication(s)" is used in connection with substitutions, deletion and/or insertions at or in the vicinity of an autolytic cleavage site it is defined to include modification(s) to reduce the rate of autolytic degradation. Modification should occur at or in the vicinity of the amino acids which comprise the susceptible polypeptide bond of those amino acids. The phrase "in the vicinity of" is defined herein to mean within three amino acids upstream or downstream of those amino acids forming the susceptible bond.<br>
"Random mutagenesis". The term "random mutagenesis" is intended to be understood in a conventional manner, i.e. to indicate an introduction of one or more mutations at random positions of the parent enzyme or introduction of random amino acid residues in selected positions or regions of the parent enzyme. The random mutagenesis is normally accompanied by a screening which allows to select for mutated enzymes which, as compared with the parent enzyme, has improved properties. Suitable techniques for introducing random mutations and screening for improved properties are discussed in further detail herein.<br>
"Wash performance" The ability of an enzyme to catalyze the degradation of various naturally occurring substrates present on the.objects to be cleaned during e.g. wash is often referred to as its washing ability, washability, detergency, or wash<br><br>
performance. Throughout this application the term wash performance will be used to encompass this property.<br>
"SAVINASE®" SAVINASE® is marketed by NOVO NORDISK A/S. It is subtilisin 309 from B. Lentus and differs from BABP92 only in having N87S (see Table I herein).<br>
"Precursor subtilase" The term "Precursor subtilase" is a subtilase defined according to Siezen et al. (Protein Engineering 4:719-737 (1991)). For further details see section named "SUBTILASES" described herein. A precursor subtilase may also be a subtilase isolated from a natural source, wherein subsequent modification have been made while retaining the characteristic of a subtilase.<br>
"Substrate" The term "Substrate" used in connection with a substrate for a protease should be interpreted in its broadest form as comprising a compound containing at least one peptide bond susceptible to hydrolysis by a subtilisin protease.<br>
"Product" The term "product" used in connection with a product derived from a protease enzymatic reaction should in the context of this invention be interpreted to include the products of a hydrolysis reaction involving a subtilisin protease. A product may be the substrate in a subsequent hydrolysis reaction.<br>
"Subtilase variant" In the context of this invention, the term subtilase variant or mutated subtilase means a subtilase that has been produced by an organism which is expressing a mutant gene derived from a parent microorganism which possessed an original or parent gene and which produced a corresponding parent enzyme, the parent gene having been mutated in order to produce the mutant gene from which said mutated subtilisin protease is produced when expressed in a suitable host.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Subtilase  variants  which  have  an  altered  autoproteolytic degradation pattern:<br>
According to the invention any precursor subtilase having a primary autoproteolytic site located at or close to residues 132-133 (in BASBPN numbering), will exhibit increased autolytic stability by being modified by substitutions at or in the<br><br>
vicinity (between residue 129-136) of said autolytic cleavage site located between residues 132-133 (in BASBPN numbering).<br>
According to the invention a precursor subtilase having such a primary autolytic cleavage site located between residues 132-133 (in BASBPN numbering), can be a subtilase variant or a wildtype subtilase. The wildtype subtilase may be any of those indicated in Table I having the above specified cleavage site. The subtilase variant may be but is not limited to the variant discussed in Table II. It is presently believed that other subtilase variants than those discussed in Table II may also have a primary autolytic cleavage site located between residues 132 and 133 (in BASBPN numbering).<br>
According to the invention a subtilase variant having modification(s) in one or more of the amino residues mentioned below (See Table II) results in altered autoproteolytic degradation sites, preferably a new primary autoproteolytic site located at or close to residues 132-133 (in BASBPN numbering).<br>
According to the invention a subtilase variant having one or more modification(s) in any of the amino acid residues shown in Table II will exhibit increased autolytic stability by being modified by substitutions at or in the vicinity (between residue 129-136) of said autolytic cleavage site located between residues 132-133 (in BASBPN numbering).<br>
A subtilase variant having one or more modification(s) in any of the amino acid residues shown in Table II, will exhibit increased autolytic stability too by being modified by substitutions at or in the vicinity (between residue 190-196) of the autolytic cleavage site located between residues 192-193 (in BASBPN numbering) and according to the invention a mutual benefit can be obtained by combining modifications in the vicinity around of both the autoproteolytic degradation sites between 132-133 and 192-193.<br>

Residues which when modified give rise to a subtilase variant<br>
with an altered autoproteolytic degradation pattern<br><br><br>
Table II was constructed using the alignment shown in Fig. 1. It is obvious that a similar or larger table covering other subtilases may easily be produced by a person skilled in the art.<br>
Furthermore Table III illustrates the specific amino acid residues in the vicinity of the mentioned autolytic cleavage site located between residues 132-133 (In BASBPN numbering). It is obvious that such a similar or larger tables covering other subtilases may easily be produced by the skilled person.<br>

Consequently the invention relates to subtilase variants having modifications in one or more of the amino residues illustrated in Table II in which the amino acid sequence further has been modified at one or more of the amino acid residue in the vicinity of the autoproteolytic site located between positions 132-133 (in BASBPN numbering) (i.e, positions 129, 130, 131, 132, 133, 134, 135, 136); or<br>
subtilase variants having modifications in one or more of the amino residues illustrated in Table II which further been modified in the vicinity of the autoproteolytic site located between positions 192-193 (in BASBPN numbering) (i.e. positions 190, 191, 192, 193, 194, 195, 196); or<br>
subtilase variants having modifications in one or more of the amino residues illustrated in Table II which further have been modified in the vicinity of both of the two autoproteolytic sites mentioned immediately above.<br>
According  to  the  invention  a  number  of  specific<br>
modifications in the vicinity of both the autoproteolytic sites<br>
'  located between 132-133 and 192-193 (in BASBPN numbering) or each<br>
of the sites will provide increased autoproteolytic stability of<br>
the subtilase.<br>
In principle the modification may be a replacement of an amino acid residue located in the vicinity of the cleavage site with any of the other 19 possible amino acid residues resulting<br><br>
in an increased autoproteolytic stability of the resulting variant. Similarly, the modification may be an insertion of one or more of any of the 20 possible amino acid residues in the vicinity of the cleavage site resulting in an increased autoproteolytic stability of the resulting variant. Further the modification may be a deletion of any of the amino acid residue located in the vicinity of the cleavage site resulting in an increased autoproteolytic stability of the resulting variant.<br>
A strategy to identify the specific modifications giving rise to increased autoproteolytic stability is to make localized random mutagenesis in the whole region in the vicinity of one of the site and/or both of the sites (e.g. localized random mutagenesis in all residues between 129-136 and/or 189-196) followed by a screening assay to identify the specific modifications giving rise to increased stability. For illustration of this strategy reference is made to working examples herein (vide infra) .<br>
A number of specific mutations, giving rise to increased autoproteolytic stability, are indicated herein (See section "B" and "C" below).<br>
By e.g. looking at Table II or III and applying the principle of the invention a number of candidates for subtilase variants with increased autoproteolytic stability becomes clear.<br>
For both precursor subtilase variants of BASBPN and BLSCAR having a autoproteolytic split site between residues 132-13 3 (in BASBPN numbering) it is appropriate to make substitutions in any of the positions in the vicinity of this autoproteolytic site in order to make variants with increased autoproteolytic stability.<br>
In the context of this invention a subtilase is defined in accordance with Siezen et al. supra. In a more narrow sense, applicable to many embodiments of the invention, the subtilases of interest are those belonging to the s-ubgroups I-Sl and I-S2. In a more specific sense, many of the embodiments of the invention relate to serine proteases of gram-positive bacteria which can be brought into substantially unambiguous homology in their primary structure, with the subtilases listed in Table I above.<br><br>
The present invention also comprises any one or more substitutions in the above mentioned positions in combination with any other substitution, deletion or addition to the amino acid sequence of the parent enzyme. Especially combinations with other substitutions known to provide improved properties to the enzyme are envisaged.<br>
Such combinations comprise the positions: 222 (improve oxidation stability)-, 218 (improves thermal stability), substitutions in the Ca-binding sites stabilising the enzyme, e,g, position 76, and many other apparent from the prior art.<br>
Furthermore combinations with the variants mentioned in EP 405 901 are also contemplated specifically.<br>

METHOD FOR PRODUCING MUTATIONS IN SUBTILASE GENES Many methods for introducing mutations into genes are well known in the art. After a brief discussion of cloning subtilase genes, methods for generating mutations in both random sites,  and specific sites, within the subtilase gene will be discussed.<br>
CLONING A SUBTILASE GENE<br>
The gene encoding a subtilase may be cloned from any of the organisms indicated in Table I, especially gram-positive bacteria or fungus, by various methods, well known in the art. First a genomic, and/or cDNA library of DNA must be constructed using chromosomal DNA or messenger RNA from the organism that produces the 'subtilase to be studied. Then, if the amino-acid sequence of the subtilase is known, homologous, labelled oligonucleotide probes may be synthesized and used to identify subtilisin-encoding clones from a genomic library of bacterial DNA, or from a cDNA library. Alternatively, a labelled oligonucleotide probe containing sequences homologous to subtilase from another strain of bacteria or organism could be used as a probe to identify<br><br>
subtilase-encoding  clones,  using  hybridization  and  washing conditions of lower stringency.<br>
Yet another method for identifying subtilase-producing clones would involve inserting fragments of genomic DNA into an expression vector, such as a plasmid, transforming protease-negative bacteria with the resulting genomic DNA library, and then plating the transformed bacteria onto agar containing a substrate for subtilase, such as skim milk. Those bacteria containing subtilase-bearing plasmid will produce colonies surrounded by a halo of clear agar, due to digestion of the skim milk by excreted subtilase.<br>
GENERATION OF RANDOM MUTATIONS IN THE SUBTILASE GENE Once the subtilase gene has been cloned into a suitable vector, such as a plasmid, several methods can be used to introduce random mutations into the gene.<br>
For instance, the random mutagenesis may be performed by use of a suitable physical or chemical mutagenizing agent, by use of a suitable oligonucleotide, or by subjecting the DNA sequence to PCR generated mutagenesis. Furthermore, the random mutagenesis may be performed by use of any combination of these mutagenizing agents.<br>
The mutagenizing agent may, e.g., be one which induces transitions, transversions, inversions, scrambling, deletions, and/or insertions-<br>
Examples of a physical or chemical mutagenizing agent suitable for the present purpose includes ultraviolet (UV) irradiation, hydroxy1amine, N-methyl-N*-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG), O-methyl hydroxylamine, nitrous acid, ethyl methane sul-phonate (EMS), sodium bisulphite, formic acid, and nucleotide analogues.<br>
When such agents are used the mutagenesis is typically performed by incubating the DNA sequence encoding the parent enzyme to be mutagenized in the presence of the mutagenizing agent of choice under suitable conditions for the mutagenesis to take place, and selecting for mutated DNA having the desired properties.<br><br>
when the mutagenesis is performed by the use of an oligonucleotide, the oligonucleotide may be doped or spiked with the three non-parent nucleotides during the synthesis of the oligonucleotide at the positions wanted to be changed. The doping or spiking may be done so that codons for unwanted amino acids are avoided. The doped or spiked oligonucleotide can be incorporated into the DNA encoding the protease enzyme by any published technique using e.g. PCR, LCR or any DNA polymerase and ligase.<br>
When PCR generated mutagenesis is used either a chemically treated or non-treated gene encoding a parent protease enzyme is subjected to PCR under conditions that increases the misincorporation of nucleotides (Deshler 1992, Leung et al. 1989).<br>
A mutator strain of E coli (Fowler et al. 1974), S. cereviciae or any other microbial organism may be used for the random mutagenesis of the DNA encoding the protease enzyme by e.g. transforming a plasmid containing the parent enzyme into the mutator strain, growing the mutator strain with the plasmid and isolating the mutated plasmid from the mutator strain. The mutated plasmid may subsequently be transformed into the expression organism.<br>
The DNA sequence to be mutagenized may conveniently be present in a genomic or cDNA library prepared from an organism expressing the parent protease enzyme. Alternatively, the DNA sequence may be present on a suitable vector such as a plasmid or a bacteriophage, which as such may be incubated with or otherwise exposed to the mutagenizing agent. The DNA to be mutagenized may also be present in a host cell either by being integrated in the genome of said cell or by being present on a vector harboured in the cell. Finally, the DNA to be mutagenized may be in isolated form. The DNA sequence to be subjected to random mutagenesis is preferably a cDNA or a genomic DNA sequence.<br>
The random mutagenesis may advantageously be located to a part of the parent protease in question. This may, e.g. , be advantageous when a certain region of the enzyme has been identified to be of particular importance for a given property of<br><br>
the enzyme, and which, when modified, is expected to result in a variant having improved properties. Such region may normally be identified when the tertiary structure of the parent enzyme has been elucidated and related to the function of the enzyme.<br>
The localized random mutagenesis is conveniently performed by use of PCR generated mutagenesis techniques as described above or any other suitable technique known in the art.<br>
Alrernatively, the DNA sequence encoding the part of the DNA sequence to be modified may be isolated, e.g. by being inserted into a suitable vector, and said part may subsequently be subjected to mutagenesis by use of any of the mutagenesis methods discussed above.<br>
The localized random mutagenesis may be performed in one or more of these regions, and is preferably performed in at least two of the regions.<br>
GENERATION OF SITE DIRECTED MUTATIONS IN THE SUBTILASE GENE<br>
Once the subtilase gene has been cloned, and desirable sites for mutation identified and the residue to substitute for the original ones have been decided, these mutations can be introduced using synthetic oligonucleotides. These oligonucleotides contain nucleotide sequences flanking the desired mutation sites; mutant nucleotides are inserted during oligonucleotide synthesis. In a preferred method. Site-directed mutagenesis is done by the "Unique site elimination (USE)" or the "Uracil-USE" technique described respectively by Deng et al. (Anal. Biochem. 200:81-88 (1992)) and Markvardsen et al. (BioTechniques 18(3):371-372 (1995)).<br>
RECOMBINANT EXPRESSION VECTORS<br>
A recombinant vector comprising a DNA construct encoding the enzyme of the invention may be any vector which may conveniently be subjected to recombinant DNA procedures, and the choice of vector will often depend on the host cell into which it is to be introduced. Thus, the vector may be an autonomously replicating vector, i.e. a vector which exists as an extrachromosomal entity, the replication of which is independent<br><br>
of chromosomal replication, e.g. a plasmid. Alternatively, the vector may be one which, when introduced into a host cell, is integrated into the host cell genome in part or in its entirety and replicated together with the chromosome(s) into which it has been integrated.<br>
The vector is preferably an expression vector in which the DNA sequence encoding the enzyme of the invention is operably linked to additional segment required for transcription of the DNA. In general, the expression vector is derived from plasmid or viral DNA, or may contain elements of both. The term, "operably linked" indicates that the segments are arranged so that they function in concert for their intended purposes, e.g. transcription initiates in a promoter and proceeds through the DNA sequence coding for the enzyme.<br>
The promoter may be any DNA sequence which shows transcriptional activity in the host cell of choice and may be derived from genes encoding proteins either homologous or heterologous to the host cell.<br>
Examples of suitable promoters for use in bacterial host cells include the promoter of the Bacillus stearothermophilus maltogenic amylase gene, the Bacillus lichenifcrmis alpha-amylase gene, the Bacillus amyloliquefaciens alpha-amylase gene, the Bacillus subtilis alkaline protease gen, or the Bacillus pumilus xylosidase gene, or the phage Lambda PR or PL promoters or the E, coli lac, trp or tac promoters.<br>
The DNA sequence encoding the enzyme of the invention may also, if necessary, be operably connected to a suitable terminator.<br>
The recombinant vector of the invention may further comprise a DNA sequence enabling the vector to replicate in the host cell in question.<br>
The vector may also comprise a selectable marker, e.g. a gene the product of which complements a defect in the host cell, or a gene encoding resistance to e.g. antibiotics like kanamycin, chloramphenicol, erythromycin, tetracycline, spectinomycine, or the like, or resistance to heavy metals or herbicides.<br><br>
To direct an enzyme of the present invention into the secretory pathway of the host cells, a secretory signal sequence (also known as a leader sequence, prepro sequence or pre sequence) may be provided in the recombinant vector. The secretory signal sequence is joined to the DNA sequence encoding the enzyme in the correct reading frame. Secretory s ignal sequences are commonly positioned 5' to the DNA sequence encoding the enzyme. The secretory signal sequence may be that normally associated with the enzyme or may be from a gene encoding another secreted protein.<br>
The procedures used to ligate the DMA sequences coding for the present enzyme, the promoter and optionally the terminator and/or secretory signal sequence, respectively, or to assemble these sequences by suitable PCR amplification schemes, and to insert them into suitable vectors containing the information necessary for replication or integration, are well known to persons skilled in the art (cf., for instance, Sambrook et al. , op.cit.) .<br>
HOST CELL<br>
The DNA sequence encoding the present enzyme introduced into the host cell may be either homologous or heterologous to the host in question. If homologous to the host cell, i.e. produced by the host cell in nature, it will typically be operably connected to another promoter sequence or, if applicable, another secretory signal sequence and/or terminator sequence than in its natural environment. The term "homologous" is intended to include a DNA sequence encoding an enzyme native to the host organism in question. The term "heterologous" is intended to include a DNA sequence not expressed by the host cell in nature. Thus, the DNA sequence may be from another organism, or it may be a synthetic sequence.<br>
The host cell into which the DNA construct or the recombinant vector of the invention is introduced may be any cell which is capable of producing the present enzyme and includes bacteria, yeast, fungi and higher eukaryotic cells.<br><br>
Examples of bacterial host cells which, on cultivation, are capable of producing the enzyme of the invention are gram-positive bacteria such as strains of Bacillus,such as strains of B, subtilis, S. licheniformis, B. lentus, B. hrevis, B. stearothermophilus, B. alkalophilus, B. amyloliguefaciens, B. coagulans, B. circulans, B. lautus, B. mgatherium or B. thuringiensis, or strains of Streptomyces, such as S. lividans or S. murinus, or gram-negative bacteria such as Echerichta coli. The transformation of the bacteria may be effected by protoplast transformation, electroporation, conjugation, or by using competent cells in a manner known per se (o Sambrook et al., supra).<br>
When expressing the enzyme in bacteria such as E. coli, the enzyme may be retained in the cytoplasm, typically as insoluble granules (known as inclusion bodies), or may be directed to the periplasmic space by a bacterial secretion sequence. In the former case, the cells are lysed and the granules are recovered and denatured after which the enzyme is refolded by diluting the denaturing agent. In the latter case, the enzyme may be recovered from the periplasmic space by disrupting the cells, e.g. by sonication or osmotic shock, to release the contents of the periplasmic space and recovering the enzyme.<br>
When expressing the enzyme in gram-positive bacteria such as Bacillus or Streptomyces strains, the enzyme may be retained in the cytoplasm, or may be directed to the extracellular medium by a bacterial secretion sequence. In the latter case, the enzyme may be recovered from the medium as described below.<br>
METHOD OF PRODUCING SUBTILASE<br>
The present invention provides a method of producing an isolated enzyme according to the invention, wherein a suitable host cell; which has been transformed with a DNA sequence encoding the enzyme, is cultured under conditions permitting the production of the enzyme, and the resulting enzyme is recovered from the culture.<br>
As defined herein, an isolated polypeptide (e.g. an enzyme) is a polypeptide which is essentially free of other non-subtilase<br><br>
polypeptides, e.g., at least about 20% pure, preferably at least about 40% pure, more preferably about 60% pure, even more preferably about 80% pure, most preferably about 90% pure, and even most preferably about 95% pure, as determined by SDS-PAGE. The term "isolated polypeptide" may alternatively be termed "purified polypeptide".<br>
When an expression vector comprising a DNA sequence encoding the enzyme is transformed into a heterologous host cell it is possible to enable heterologous recombinant production of the enzyme of the invention.<br>
Thereby it is possible to make a highly purified subtilase composition, characterized in being free from homologous impurities.<br>
In this context homologous impurities means any impurities (e.g. other polypeptides than the enzyme of the invention) which originate from the homologous cell where the enzyme of the invention is originally obtained from.<br>
The medium used to culture the transformed host cells may be any conventional medium suitable for growing the host cells in question. The expressed subtilase may conveniently be secreted into the culture medium and may be recovered therefrom by well-known procedures including separating the cells from the medium by centrifugation or filtration, precipitating proteinaceous components of the medium by means of a salt such as ammonium sulphate, followed by chromatographic procedures such as ion exchange chromatography, affinity chromatography, or the like.<br>
DETERGENT COMPOSITIONS COMPRISING THE MUTANT ENZYMES<br>
The present invention also comprises the use of the mutant enzymes of the invention in cleaning and detergent compositions and such compositions comprising the mutant subtilisin enzymes. Such cleaning and detergent compositions are described in further details below.<br>
DETERGENT DISCLOSURE AND EXAMPLES<br><br>
Surfactant system<br>
The detergent compositions according to the present invention comprise a surfactant system, wherein the surfactant can be selected from nonionic and/or anionic and/or cationic and/or ampholytic and/or zwitterionic and/or semi-polar surfactants.<br>
The surfactant is typically present at a level from 0.1% to 60% by weight.<br>

Bleaching agents: Additional optional detergent ingredients that can be included in the detergent compositions of the present invention include bleaching agents such as PBl, PB4 and percarbonate with a particle size of 400-800 microns. These bleaching agent components can include one or more oxygen bleaching agents and, depending upon the bleaching agent chosen, one or more bleach activators. When present oxygen bleaching compounds will typically be present at levels of from about 1% to about 25%. In general, bleaching compounds are optional added components in non-liquid formulations, e.g. granular detergents.<br>
The bleaching agent component for use herein can be any of the bleaching agents useful for detergent compositions including oxygen bleaches as well as others known in the art.<br>
The bleaching agent suitable for the present invention can be an activated or non-activated bleaching agent.<br>
One category of oxygen bleaching agent that can be used encompasses percarboxylic acid bleaching agents and salts thereof. Suitable examples of this class of agents include magnesium monoperoxyphthalate hexahydrate, the magnesium salt of meta-chloro perbenzoic acid, 4-nonylamino-4-oxoperoxybutyric acid and diperoxydodecanedioic acid. Such bleaching agents are disclosed in US 4,483,781, US 740,446, EP 0 133 354 and US 4,412,934. Highly preferred bleaching agents also include 6-nonylamino-6-oxoperoxycaproic acid as described in US 4,634,551.<br>
Another category of bleaching agents that can be used encompasses the halogen bleaching agents. Examples of hypohalite bleaching agents, for example, include trichloro isocyanuric acid and the sodium and potassium dichloroisocyanurates and N-chloro and N-bromo alkane sulphonamides. Such materials are normally added at 0.5-10% by weight of the finished product, preferably 1-5% by weight.<br>
The hydrogen peroxide releasing agents can be used in combination with bleach activators such as tetra-acetylethylenediamine (TAED), nonanoyloxybenzenesulfonate (NOBS,<br><br>
described in US 4,412,934), 3,5-trimethyl-hexsanolo-xybenzenesulfonate (ISONOBS, described in EP 120 591) or pentaacetylglucose (PAG), which are perhydrolyzed to form a peracid as the active bleaching species, leading to improved bleaching effect. In addition, very suitable are the bleach activators C8(6-octanamido-caproyl) oxybenzene-sulfonate, C9 (6-nonanamido caproyl) oxybenzenesulfonate and CIO (6-decanamido caproyl) oxybenzenesulfonate or mixtures thereof. Also suitable activators are acylated citrate esters such as disclosed in European Patent Application No. 91870207.7.<br>
Useful bleaching agents, including peroxyacids and bleaching systems comprising bleach activators and peroxygen bleaching compounds for use in cleaning compositions according to the invention are described in application USSN 08/136,626.<br>
The hydrogen peroxide may also be present by adding an enzymatic system (i.e. an enzyme and a substrate therefore) which is capable of generation of hydrogen peroxide at the beginning or iuring the washing and/or rinsing process. Such enzymatic systems are disclosed in European Patent Application EP 0 537 381.<br>
Bleaching agents other than oxygen bleaching agents are al so known in the art and can be ut i 1 i zed here in. One type of non-oxygen bleaching agent of particular interest includes photoactivated bleaching agents such as the sulfonated zinc and-/or aluminium phthalocyanines. These materials can be deposited upon the substrate during the washing process. Upon irradiation with light, in the presence of oxygen, such as by hanging clothes out to dry in the daylight, the sulfonated zinc phthalocyanine is activated and, consequently, the substrate is bleached. Preferred zinc phthalocyanine and a photoactivated bleaching process are described in US 4,033,718. Typically, detergent composition will contain about 0.025% to about 1.25%, by weight, of sulfonated zinc phthalocyanine.<br>
Bleaching agents may also comprise a manganese catalyst. The manganese catalyst may, e.g., be one of the compounds described in "Efficient manganese catalysts for low-temperature bleaching". Nature 369, 1994, pp. 637-639.<br><br>
Suds suppressors: Another optional ingredient is a suds suppressor, exemplified by silicones, and silica-silicone mixtures. Silicones can generally be represented by alkylated polysiloxane materials, while silica is normally used in finely divided forms exemplified by silica aerogels and xerogels and hydrophobic silicas of various types. Theses materials can be incorporated as particulates, in which the suds suppressor is advantageously releasably incorporated in a water-soluble or waterdispersible, substantially non surface-active detergent impermeable carrier. Alternatively the suds suppressor can be dissolved or dispersed in a liquid carrier and applied by spraying on to one or more of the other components.<br>
A preferred silicone suds controlling agent is disclosed in US 3,933,672. Other particularly useful suds suppressors are the self-emulsifying silicone suds suppressors, described in German Patent Application DTOS 2,646,126. An example of such a compound is DC-544, commercially available form Dow Corning, which is a siloxane-glycol copolymer. Especially preferred suds controlling agent are the suds suppressor system comprising a mixture of silicone oils and 2-alkyl-alkanols. Suitable 2-alkyl-alkanols are 2-butyl-octanol which are commercially available under the trade name Isofol 12 R.<br>

Especially preferred silicone suds controlling agents are described in European Patent Application No. 92201649.8. Said compositions can comprise a silicone/ silica mixture in combination with fumed nonporous silica such as Aerosil .<br>
The suds suppressors described above are normally employed at levels of from 0.001% to 2% by weight of the composition, preferably from 0.01% to 1% by weight.<br>
Other components: Other components used in detergent compositions may be employed such as soil-suspending agents, soil-releasing agents, optical brighteners, abrasives, bactericides, tarnish inhibitors, coloring agents, and/or encapsulated or nonencapsula-ted perfumes.<br><br>
Especially suitable encapsulating materials are water soluble capsules which consist of a matrix of polysaccharide and polyhydroxy compounds such as described in GB 1,464,616.<br>
Other suitable water soluble encapsulating materials comprise dextrins derived from ungelatinized starch acid esters of substituted dicarboxylic acids such as described in US 3,455,838. These acid-ester dextrins are, preferably, prepared from such starches as waxy maize, waxy sorghum, sago, tapioca and potato. Suitable examples of said encapsulation materials include N-Lok manufactured by National Starch. The N-Lok encapsulating material consists of a modified maize starch and glucose. The starch is modified by adding monofunctional substituted groups such as octenyl succinic acid anhydride.<br>
Antiredeposition and soil suspension agents suitable herein include cellulose derivatives such as methylcellulose, carboxymethylcellulose and hydroxyethylcellulose, and homo- or co-polymeric polycarboxylic acids ~ or their salts. Polymers of this type include the polyacrylates and maleic anhydride-acrylic acid copolymers previously mentioned as builders, as well as copolymers of maleic anhydride with ethylene, methylvinyl ether or methacrylic acid, the maleic anhydride constituting at least 20 mole percent of the copolymer. These materials are normally used at levels of from 0.5% to 10% by weight, more preferably form 0.75% to 8%, most preferably from 1% to 6% by weight of the composition.<br>

other useful polymeric materials are the polyethylene glycols, particularly those of molecular weight 1000-10000, more particularly 2000 to 8000 and most preferably about 4000. These are used at levels of from 0.20% to 5% more preferably from 0.25% to 2.5% by weight. These polymers and the previously mentioned homo- or- co-polymeric poly-carboxylate salts are valuable for improving whiteness maintenance, fabric ash deposition, and cleaning performance on clay, proteinaceous and oxidizable soils in the presence of transition metal impurities.<br>
Soil release agents useful in compositions of the present invention are conventionally copolymers or terpolymers of terephthalic acid with ethylene glycol and/or propylene glycol units in various arrangements. Examples of such polymers are disclosed in US 4,116,885 and 4,711,730 and EP 0 272 033 . A particular preferred polymer in accordance with EP 0 272 03 3 has the formula:<br><br>
Also  very  useful  are  modified  polyesters  as  random copolymers of dimethyl terephthalate, dimethyl sulfoisophthalate, ethylene glycol and 1,2-propanediol, the end groups consisting primarily of sulphobenzoate and secondarily of mono esters of ethylene glycol and/or 1,2-propanediol. The target is to obtain a polymer capped at both end by sulphobenzoate groups, "primarily", in the present context most of said copolymers herein will be endcapped by sulphobenzoate groups. However, some copolymers will be less than fully capped, and therefore their end groups may consist of monoester of ethylene glycol and/or 1,2-propanediol, thereof consist "secondarily" of such species.<br>
The selected polyesters herein contain about 46% by weight of dimethyl terephthalic acid,  about 16% by weight of 1,2-<br><br>
propanediol, about 10% by weight ethylene glycol, about 13% by weight of dimethyl sulfobenzoic acid and about 15% by weight of sulfoisophthalic acid, and have a molecular weight of about 3.000. The polyesters and their method of preparation are described in detail in EP 311 342.<br>
Softening agents: Fabric softening agents can also be incorporated into laundry detergent compositions in accordance with the present invention. These agents may be inorganic or organic in type. Inorganic softening agents are exemplified by the smectite clays disclosed in GB-A-1 400898 and in US 5,019,2 92. Organic fabric softening agents include the water insoluble tertiary amines as disclosed in GB-Al 514 276 and EP 0 Oil 340 and their combination with mono C12-C14 quaternary ammonium salts are disclosed in EP-B-0 026 528 and di-long-chain amides as disclosed in EP 0 242 919. Other useful organic ingredients of fabric softening systems include high molecular weight polyethylene oxide materials as disclosed in EP 0 299 575 and 0 313 146.<br>
Levels of smectite clay are normally in the range from 5% to 15%, more preferably from 8% to 12% by weight, with the material being added as a dry mixed component to the remainder of the formulation. Organic fabric softening agents such as the water-insoluble tertiary amines or dilong chain amide materials are incorporated at levels of from 0.5% to 5% by weight, normally from 1% to 3% by weight whilst the high molecular weight polyethylene oxide materials and the water soluble cationic materials are added at levels of from 0.1% to 2%, normally from 0.15% to 1,5% by weight. These materials are normally added to the spray dried portion of the composition, although in some instances it may be more convenient to add them as a dry mixed particulate, or spray them as molten liquid on to other solid components of the composition.<br>
Polymeric dye-transfer inhibiting agents: The detergent compositions according to the present invention may also comprise from 0.001% to 10%, preferably from 0.01% to 2%, more preferably<br><br>
form 0.05% to 1% by weight of polymeric dye- transfer inhibiting agents. Said polymeric dye-transfer inhibiting agents are normally incorporated into detergent compositions in order to inhibit the transfer of dyes from colored fabrics onto fabrics washed therewith. These polymers have the abilicy of complexing or adsorbing the fugitive dyes washed out of dyed fabrics before the dyes have the opportunity to become attached to other articles in the wash.<br>
Especially suitable polymeric dye-transfer inhibiting agents are polyamine N-oxide polymers, copolymers of N-vinyl-pyrrolidone and N-vinylimidazole, polyvinylpyrrolidone polymers, polyvinyloxazolidones and polyvinylimidazoles or mixtures thereof.<br>
Addition of such polymers also enhances the performance of the enzymes according the invention.<br>

Examples of film-forming coating materials suitable for application by fluid bed techniques are given in GB 1483591.<br>
Granular compositions according to the present invention can also be in "compact form", i.e. they may have a relatively higher density than conventional granular detergents, i.e. form 550 to 950 g/1; in such case, the granular detergent compositions according to the present invention will contain a lower amount of "Inorganic filler salt", compared to conventional granular detergents; typical filler salts are alkaline ear.h metal salts of sulphates and chlorides, typically sodium sulphate; "Compact"<br><br>
detergenc typically comprise not more than 10% filler salt. The liquid compositions according to the present invention can also be in "concentrated form", in such case, the liquid detergent compositions according to the present invention will contain a lower amount of water, compared to conventional liquid detergents. Typically, the water content of the concentrated liquid detergent is less than 30%, more preferably less than 20%, most preferably less than 10% by weight of the detergent compositions.<br>

pSX222: B. subtilis expression vector (Described in PCT/DK96/00207) .<br>
General molecular biology methods:<br><br>
Unless otherwise mentioned the DNA manipulations and transformations were performed using standard methods of molecular biology (Sambrook et al. (1989) Molecular cloning: A laboratory manual, Cold Spring Harbor lab., Cold Spring Harbor, NY; Ausubel, F. M. et al. (eds.) "Current protocols in Molecular Biology". John Wiley and Sons, 1995; Harwood, C. R., and Cutting, S. M. (eds.) "Molecular Biological Methods for Bacillus". John Wiley and Sons, 1990).	Enzymes for DNA manipulations were used according to the specifications of the suppliers.<br>
Enzymes for DNA manipulations<br>
Unless otherwise mentioned all enzymes for DNA manipulations, such as e.g. restiction endonucleases, ligases etc., are obtained from New England Biolabs, Inc.<br>
Construction of random mutagehized libraries<br>
Performing localized random mutagenesis<br>
A  mutagenic  primer  (oligonucleotide)  is  synthesized  which corresponds to the part of the DNA sequence to be mutagenized except for the nucleotide(s) corresponding to amino acid codon(s) to be mutagenized.<br>
Subsequently, the resulting mutagenic primer is used in a PCR reaction with a suitable opposite primer. The resulting PCR fragment is purified and digested and cloned into the shuttle vector.<br>
Alternatively and if necessary, the resulting PCR fragment is used in a second PCR reaction as a primer with a second suitable opposite primer so as to allow digestion and cloning of the mutagenized region into the shuttle vector. The PCR reactions are performed under normal conditions.<br>
Proteolytic Activity<br>
In the context of this invention proteolytic activity is expressed in Kilo NOVO Protease Units (KNPU). The activity is determined relatively to an enzyme standard (SAVINASEO) , and the determination is based on the digestion of a dimethyl casein<br><br>
(DMC) solution by the proteolytic enzyme at standard conditions, i.e. 50°C, pH 8.3, 9 min. reaction time, 3 min. measuring time. A folder AF 220/1 is available upon request to Novo Nordisk A/S, Denmark, which folder is hereby included by reference.<br>
A GU is a Glycine Unit, defined as the proteolytic enzyme activity which, under standard conditions, during a 15-minutes' incubation at 40 deg C, with N-acetyl casein as substrate, produces an amount of NH2-group equivalent to 1 mmole of glycine.<br>
Enzyme activity can also be measured using the PNA assay, according to reaction with the soluble substrate succinyl-alanine-alanine-proline-phenyl-alanine-para-nitrophenol, which is described in the Journal of American Oil Chemists Society, Rothgeb, T.M., Goodlander, B.D., Garrison, P.H., and Smith, L.A., (1988) .<br>
Fermentation:<br>
Fermentation of subtilase enzymes were performed at 30°C on a rotary shaking table (300 r.p.m.) in 500 ml baffled Erlenmeyer flasks containing 100 ml BPX medium for 5 days.<br>
Consequently, in order to make an e.g. 2 liter broth 2 0 Erlenmeyer flasks were fermented simultaneously.<br>
Assay to test for proteases with increased autoproteolytic stability:<br>
Samples containing protease are made by growing strains in eluding reference strains in suitable media allowing expression of protease in either microtiter plates or shake flasks.<br>
From each sample containing protease, aliquots are taken, to which are added 1/10 vol. 2 M Glycin-NaOH buffer; pH 10.0, and the aliquots are incubated for 3 hours at 4°C and 55°C, respectively.<br>
After incubation the protease activities are determined using  the  substrate  succinyl-alanine-alanine-para-nitrophenol (Suc-Ala-Ala-pNA) at 0.6 g/1 in the following buffer:<br>
150 mM KCl, 50 mM Na2B407/ pH adjusted to 9.0.<br>
20 (il sample + 180 fil substrate are mixed in wells of 96-well microtiter plate.<br><br>
Color development is followed at 4 05 nm in a microplate reader.<br>
Activities are determined using Savinase® as standard.<br>
The residual activity of a sample is calculated as the protease activity of the aliquot incubated at 55°C in percentage of the protease activity of the aliquot incubated at 4°C.<br>
The proteases exhibiting increased residual activity are identified.<br>

EXAMPLE 1<br><br>
Construction and Expression of Enzyme Variants:Construction and Expression of Enzyme Variants:<br>
Subtilase 309 site-directed variants was made by the "Unique site elimination (USE)" or the "Uracil-USE" technique described respectively by Deng et al, (Anal. Biochem. 200:81-88 (1992)) and Markvardsen et al. (BioTechniques 18 (3) :371-372 (1995)).<br>
The template plasmid was^ pJS3; or a analogue of this containing a variant of Subtilase 3 09, e.g. USE mutagenesis was performed on pJS3 analogue containing a gene encoding the Y167I+R17GL variant with a oligonucleotide directed to the construct A194P variant resulting in a final Y167I+R170L+A194P Subtilase 309 variant.<br>
The in pJS3 constructed Subtilase 309 variants was then subcloned into the B.subtilis pSX222 expression plasmid, using the restriction enzymes Kpnl and Mlul.<br>
This construct was transformed into a competent B. subtilis strain and in order to purify the protease fermented as described above in a medium containing 10 μg/ml Chloramphenicol (CAM) .<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
Purification of Enzyme Variants:<br>
This procedure relates to purification of a 2 litre scale fermentation of the Subtilisin 147 enzyme, the Subtilisin 309 enzyme or mutants thereof.<br>
Approximately 1.6 litres of fermentation broth were centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 35 minutes in 1 litre beakers. The supematants were adjusted to pH 6.5 using 10% acetic acid and filtered on Seitz Supra SlOO filter plates.<br>
The filtrates were concentrated to approximately 400 ml using an Amicon CH2A UF unit equipped with an Amicon SIY10 UP cartridge. The UF concentrate was centrifuged and filtered prior to absorption at room temperature on a Bacitracin affinity column at pH 7. The protease was eluted from the Bacitracin column at room temperature using 25% 2-propanol and 1 M sodium chloride in<br><br>
a buffer solution with 0.01 dimethylglutaric acid, 0.1 M boric acid and 0.002 M calcium chloride adjusted to pH 7.<br>
The fractions with protease activity from the Bacitracin purification step were combined and applied to a 750 ml Sephadex G25 column (5 cm dia.) equilibrated with a buffer containing 0.01 dimethylglutaric acid, 0.2 M boric acid and 0.002 m calcium chloride adjusted to pH 6.5.<br>
Fractions with proteolytic activity from the Sephadex G25 column were combined and applied to a 150 ml CM Sepharose CL 6B cation exchange column (5 cm dia.) equilibrated with a buffer containing 0.01 M dimethylglutaric acid, 0.2 M boric acid, and 0.002 M calcium chloride adjusted to pH 6.5.<br>
The protease was eluted using a linear gradient of 0-0.1 M sodium chloride in 2 litres of the same buffer (0-0.2 M sodium chloride in case of Subtilisin 147).<br>
In a final purification step protease containing fractions from the CM Sepharose column were combined and concentrated in an Amicon ultrafiltration cell equipped with a GR81PP membrane (from the Danish Sugar Factories Inc.).<br>

EXAMPLE 3<br>
Identification of autolytic cleavage site:<br>
A fraction of the Savinase® variant N:167I+R170L (after purification as described above) was by SDS-PAGE analysis found to contain two bands supposedly originating from autolytic degradation. The bands migrated with Mr's of 12 kDa and 10 kDa, respectively. The N-tenninal amino acid sequences of the peptides constituting these two bands were determined following SDS-PAGE and electroblotting onto a PVDF membrane.<br>
The N-terminal amino acid sequence of the band migrating with Mr 12 kDa was found to be Ala-Gln-Ser-Val-Pro-Trp-Gly-Ile-Ser- which is identical to the N-terminal amino acid sequence of N:Y167I+R170L.<br>
The N-terminal amino acid sequence of the band migrating with Mr 10 kDa was found to be Gly-Ala-Gly-Leu-Asp-Ile-Val-Ala-Pro- which is identical to the amino acid sequence of amino acid residues 187 to 195 in N:Y167I+R170L (residues 193 to 201 in BPN' numbering). This identifies the peptide bond between amino acid residues 186 and 187 in N:Y167I+R170L (residues 192 and 193 in BPN' numbering) as an autolytic cleavage site.<br>
Matrix assisted laser desorption ionisation time-of-flight mass spectrometry of the fraction revealed that the masses of the two components were 12,997.5 KDa ± 13 KDa and 8,397.8 KDa ± 8 KDa, respectively.<br>
The theoretical mass of the autolytic fragment consisting of amino acid residues 187 to 269 in N:Y167I+R170L (residues 193 to 275 in BPN' numbering) is 8,3 97.3 KDa thereby confirming that no other autolytic cleavages have occured C-terminal to residue 186.<br><br>
Using the mass value of the larger fragment (12,997.5 KDa) it is possible to deduce that the other autolytic cleavage has occured between amino acid residues 13 0 and 131 in N:Y167I+R170L (residues 132 and 133 in BPN' numbering). The theoretical mass of the autolytic fragment consisting of amino acid residues 1 to 130 in N:Y167I+R170L (residues 1 to 132 in BPN' numbering) is 12,699.1 kDa.<br>
To substantiate these findings of autolytic cleavage sites in N:Y167I+R170L, the protease was incubated in a concentration of 2 mg/ml in 0.1 M sodium phosphate, pH 7.5 at 3 7 °C. At various time points from 0 min to 6 hours a 20 jil aliqout of the incubation mixture was withdrawn and added 80 )il 1% TFA resulting in an irreversible inhibition of the proteolytic activity of N: Y167I+R170L. The samples were kept in the freezer until analysis by matrix assisted laser desorption time-of-flight mass spectrometry.<br>
~The result of the mass spectrometry clearly showed a steady increase in the amount of fragments with masses of 12,698.9 kDa ± 13 kDa and 8,396.1 kDa ± 8 kDa, respectively, and a steady decrease in the component with mass 26,607.0 KDa ± 26 kDa. The theoretical mass of N:Y167I-f-R170L is 26,605.4 kDa.<br>
EXAMPLE 4<br>
Construction of random Protease variants<br>
3 Random libraries was constructed in the vicinity of the autoproteolytic claevage site 132-133. In each of the 3 libraries the BLS309 variant Y167I+R170L was used as template.<br>
The construction of the 3 libraries of amino acids (aa) 1) 129-131,  2)132-133,  3)134-135 were prepared as described in Materials and Methods above.<br>
One oligonucleotide was synthesized with 25% of each of the four bases in the first and the second base at amino acid codons wanted to be mutagenized. The third nucleotide (the wobble base) in codons were synthesized with 50%G/50%C to give a larger likelihood for changes to amino acids with one or two codons.<br><br>
The mutagenic primer were used in a PCR reaction with a suitable opposite primer and the plasmid pJS3:(Y167I+R170L) as template. The resulting PCR fragment were purified and the resulting PCR fragment was used in a second PCR reaction as a primer with a second suitable opposite primer. This step was advantageous to  be able to digest and clone the mutagenized region into the pJS3 shuttle vector.<br>
Libraries of region 129-131, 132-133, 134-135 have been prepared containing from 10,000 to 80.000 clones/library.<br>
Ten randomly chosen colonies were sequenced to confirm the mutations designed.<br>
EXAMPLE 5<br>
Identification of protease variants with increase autoproteolytic<br>
activity<br>
The clones in each library constructed as described in example 4<br>
is tested for autoproteolytic stability as described above.<br>
For each library 500 individual clones are inciibated in a microtiter plate overnight at 37oC in 200 p.1 LB medium with 10 μg/ml Chloramphenicol (CAM) .<br>
With the SAVINASECS) variant N: Y167I+R170L as reference strain two variants with relative increased autoproteolytic stability was identified X:A133D+Y167I+R170L, Y: P129K+Y167I+R170L, and GG:P129K+P131H+Y167I+R170L.<br>
This illustrates that the substitutions (P129K; P131H, A133D) in the vicinity of the autoproteolytic cleavage site located between 132-13 3 provide increased autoproteolytic stability.<br>
EXAMPLE 6<br>
Comparative fermentation experiment with variant(s) with increased autoproteolytic stability<br>
The Savinase® variant "M: Y167I+R170L+A194P" was in a fermentation experiment compared to its precursor variant "N: Y167I+R170L" not having the A194P substitution in the vicinity of the autoproteolytic split site located between residues 192-193.<br><br>
Both variants were cloned in a pSX222 expression vector<br>
background and fermented as described above in a 100 ml BPX medium cntaining 10 |ig/ml CAM.<br>
After 5 days fermentation 1.5 ml of the BPX fermentation medium v;as centrifuged and the supernatant was used to measure the Prcreolytic activity (KPNU) as described above.<br>
The fermentation medium containing the "M: Y167I+R170L+A194P" variant had a significant higher level of proteolytic activity as compared to the fermentation medium containing the "N: Y167I+R170L" variant.<br>
It is presently believed that both variants have the same specific activity, and consequently it is presently believed that the higher Proteolytic activity level in the fermentation medium containing the "M: Y167I+R170L-I-A194P" variant is due to a relatively increased autoproteolytic stability in the "M: Y167I+R170L+A194P" variant compared to the "N: Y167I+R170L" precursor variant not having the A194P substitution.<br>
Similar results were obtained with the variants O:Y167A-R170S+A194P, P:Y167A+R170L+A194P, and Q:Y167A+R170N+A194P compared with their corresponding precursor variant without the A194? mutation.<br>
Further, similar results were obtained with the variant HH: A13 3P+Y167A+R170S compared with its corresponding precursor variant without the A133P mutation, showing that the substitution A133? give increased autoproteolytic activity.<br><br><br>
