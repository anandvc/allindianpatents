DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides an antenna for use in wireless communication systems which addresses the above noted problems. One embodimwit of the present invention c^erates across various frequency bands, 806 - 960 MHz )and, 380 - 470 MHz band, 1710 - 2170 MHz. Although the present invention s particulariy adapted for use in a base station, it also can be used in ai) types of elecommunication systems, such as WiMax 2.3 GHz, 2.5 GHz and 3.5 GHz lands, etc.<br>
=ig. 1 shows a set of four example dipole array antennas 10 with a common input 11, according to the present invention, for transmitting and receiving slectromagnetic signals. Ba.dn antenna element 10 (Fig. 7) includes two arms 18, 20. a ground plate 12 and two electrical conductors/legs 14 and 16 (Figs. 5 and 6). The conductor 16 Is attached to ground using the plate 12, with a dipole irm 18 (Fig. 6) towards one side, while the other conductoi^ 14 is spaced to the jround by a dielectric 23 (Fig. 3B}, such as air, foam, etc., with a dipole amn 20 ;Fig. 5) towards the opposite side of dipole arm 20, therefore fonriing a dipole :onfiguration. Each dipole arm fonns a radiating section/element. In this sxample. the conductor 14 and dipole arm 20 are formed/stamped from a sheet 3f conductive material, forming an L^hape. Further, the conductor 16 and dipole arm 18 are formed/stamped from a sheet of conductive material, fonning an L-shape. The input conductors 14 and 16 are separated by a gap 22 (Figs. 3B, 8A-Z).<br>
the conductor 14 connecte a part of the dipole ami 20 to a feed line 24 and «ie Mrtductor 16 aannects a part of the d^jole amn 18 to ground wa ttie plate 12.<br><br>
'he conductors 14 and 16 form a paired strips transmission line having an   . Tipedance.   The arms 18, 20 also have an impedance.<br>
'he impedance of the paired strips transmission line 14, 16, is adjusted by 'arying the viridth of conductor actions 14, 16 antWor the gap 22 therebetween. The spedfic dimensions vary with the application. As such, ttie intrinsic input mpedance of each dipole is adjusted to mateh tfte impedani^ of the :orresponding feed section.<br>
The two conductor sections 14, 16 of the dipole antenna form a balanced paired strips transmission line; ttierefore, it is unnecessary to provide a balun. This jrovides the antenna 10 with a very wide impedance bandwidth. Also, the antenna 10 has a stebte fer-field pattern across the impedance bandwidth.<br>
-ig. 4 shows an isometric view of a single dipole antenna 10 on the ground plane 28. Fig. 5 shows the dipole arm 20 with the microstrip feed line 24 attached and rig. 6 shov\^ the dipole arm 18 that can be attached to the ground plane 28 via :he plate 12. The feed line 24 (and its extension feed line 11) comprises a microstip feed line spaced from the ground plane 28 by non-conductor such as air dielectric (e.g., dielectric 23). The impedance of ttie mic^strip line is adjusted by varying the width of the element 24, and/or the space be^^'ee^ Vne microsWp line to the ground plane. The fe^ line 24 is shown as a unitary element of the conductor 14. Fig. 7 shows an isometric view of the dipole antenna 10, as combination of elements in Figs. 5 and 6.<br>
The conductor section 16 can be connected to the ground plane 28 by any suitatJle fastening device 30 (Fig. 3B) such as a nut and bolt, a screw, a rivet, or any suitable fastening method including soldering, welding, etc. The suitable osnr^ection provides both an etectrical and mechanical connection between the conductor 16 and ground plane 28.<br><br>
he arrangement of the four dipole antennas 10 in Fig. 1 provides 90 degree, 05 degree, and 120 degree 3 dB azimuth beam vwdtti base station antenna nplementations, with different shapes of the ground plane 28. The staggered iipole arrangement in Fig. 2 and Figs. 3A-B provide a 65 degree 3 dB azimuth earn width base station antenna implementations. In the staggered irrangem^it in Fig. 2 the legs 14, 16 of the antennas 10 are essentially eipendicular to the ground plane 28.<br>
n the above implementation, Vne legs 14,16 of each antenna 10 are at about 90 legree angles in r^ation to the ground plane 28- In another implementation, the sgs 14,16 of an antenna 10 can be at less than 90 degree angles to the ground &gt;lane 28. For example, the legs 14, 16 of an antenna 10 can tie t)elween aboxrt )0 degrees (perpendicular to the ground plane 28) and about 30 degree to the iround plane 28. Other angles are possible. Figs. 3A-B provide examples of a itaggered arrangement with the legs 14, 16 of each antenna between about 90 legrees (perpendicular to the ground plane 28) and about 30 degree to the iround plane 28.<br>
'ig. 3A shov^ a staggered arrangement of four dipole antennas 10A~O on the iround plane 28, wherein the legs 14, 16 of each the antenna 10A are transverse , n relation to the legs 14,16 of the antenna 10B. Further, the legs 14, 16 of the intenna 10A are at less than 90 degree angles (e.g., 30 to 90 degrees) in elation to the ground plane 28. SImilariy, the legs 14, 16 of the antenna 10B are It less than 90 degree angles (e.g., 30 to 90 degrees) in relation to the ground )lane 28. As such, in this example the dipole antennas 10A and 10B can be at ransverse angles of e.g. greater than 0 to about 120 degrees, in relation to one mother. Other transverse angles between the antennas 10A and 108 are )ossible.<br><br>
:imilariy the legs of the antennas IOC and 10D are transverse in relation to one nother, and at less ttian 90 degrees in relation to the ground plane 28. Fig. 3B hows a partial end view of the staggered dipole arrangement of Fig. 3A, howing antennas lOAand 106.<br>
ipedfic additional variations and miplementation details will vary with the larticular application as will be appreciated by ^ose skilled in the art. For jxample, Figs. 8A-C show top views of alternate dipole ann anangements, iccording to ttie present invention. The gap 22 between the legs 14 and 16 in he alternate antennas 40A-C in Figs. 8A-C is the same, while Figs. 8B and 8C ihow an enlarged view of the gap 22 for clarity.<br>
"ig. SA shows a top view of the antenna 40A wherein the dipole amis 18, 20 and he legs 14, 16 are symmetric. Further, the legs 14 and 16 are the same distance rom the cenleriine 32A of the dipole arms 18. 20. Fig. 8B shows a top view of he antenna 4QB wherein the dipole arms 18, 20 are asymmetric, and the leg 16 ies on the centerJine 32B of the dipole arms 18, 20. Fig. 8C shows a top view of he antenna 40C wherein the dipole arms 18, 20 are asymmetric, and the leg 14 ies on the centerijne 32C of the dipole amis 18, 20.<br>
-urther features and advantages of tiie invention will be apparent to those skilled n the art. Also, it will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that a variety of nodifications of the illustrated implementation are possible v^^iie remaining within he scope of the invention.<br><br><br>
