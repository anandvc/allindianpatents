				<td>DEVICE USED AS A CHEMICAL REACTOR OR HEAT EXCHANGER IN GENERAL, WITH A THIN TUBE PLATE<br>
The present invention relates to a device used as a chemical reactor or heat exchanger in general, with a thin tube plate.<br>
The present invention also applies to petrochemical and refinery reactors.<br>
As is known, chemical reactors consist of large-sized containers, inside which chemical reactions take place at a high temperature and high pressure.<br>
Inside their substantially cylindrical body, these chemical reactors generally have a plurality of pipes or tube bundles which can carry out various functions, including heat exchange between the operating fluids.<br>
These tube bundles are installed and retained in the operative position by means of the use of tube plates, which in some cases can have a large surface area.<br>
With particular reference to the state of the art, it can be noted that at present the tube plates are produced in a single piece, or alternatively in several welded pieces, and are then finished, for example they are drilled and/or machined.<br>
The tube plates are usually designed with a thickness which makes it possible to withstand the loads applicable.<br>
Above all in the case of chemical reactors, the loads, whether caused by the weight, pressure or temperature of use, can generate high levels of stresses. Plates with substantial thicknesses are thus required, which are sometimes at the limit of technical feasibility.<br>
In particular in these cases, these plates can alternatively be produced with a reduced thickness, but with the addition of elements which are used to strengthen the plates themselves.<br>
Various methods for strengthening tube plates are known according to the state of the art.<br>
Design codes are also known which regulate the dimensional criteria for the plates and for strengthening the latter.<br>
In general the known strengtheners consist of reinforcement ribs, which are welded to the thin plates such as to limit the deformations and stresses to which the plates are subjected.<br>
These strengtheners are very costly and their size, by reducing considerably the useful space for insertion of the tubes on the plates, leads to a significant increase in the diameter of the plates themselves and consequently in the overall diameter of the equipment.<br>
The object of the present invention is thus to eliminate the aforementioned disadvantages and in particular to provide a device which is used as a<br>
chemical reactor or heat exchanger in general, with a thin tube plate, which makes it possible to reduce the costs of construction of the device itself.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a device which is used as a chemical reactor or heat exchanger in general, with a thin tube plate, which makes it possible to lighten the device itself and facilitate its installation.<br>
A further object of the present invention is to provide a device used as a chemical reactor or heat exchanger in general, with a thin tube plate, which is safe and reliable when it is installed.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a device used as a chemical reactor or heat exchanger in general, with a thin tube plate, which is particularly-simple and functional.<br>
This object and others according to the invention are achieved by providing a device used as a chemical reactor or heat exchanger in general, with a thin tube plate, as described in claim 1.<br>
Further characteristics are indicated in the subsequent claims.<br>
The characteristics and advantages of a device used as a chemical reactor or heat exchanger in general, with a thin tube plate, according to the present invention, will  become  clearer  and  more  apparent  from  the<br>
following description provided by way of non-limiting example with reference to the attached schematic drawings, in which:<br>
figure 1 is a cross-section of a device used as a chemical reactor or heat exchanger in general, which shows a pipe connected to a plate, the plate being produced according to the known art; and figure 2 is a cross-section of a device used as a chemical reactor or heat exchanger in general, which shows the pipe in figure 1 connected to a thin plate, the plate being provided with a system for transfer of the loads according to the teaching of the present invention.<br>
Figure 1 shows a device used as a chemical reactor or heat exchanger in general, indicated as 10 as a whole, according to the known art.<br>
In the example illustrated, the device 10 comprises a pipe system 12. This system, in preferred embodiments described by way of non-limiting example, comprises pipes which are superimposed and is secured to a tube plate 14 disposed perpendicularly to the axis of the pipes.<br>
A chamber 16 which acts as a fluid distributor is connected to the tube plate 14. In the example illustrated, this chamber 16 is produced by means of a section in the shape of a "U", with a base 18 which is joined to the plate 14 by a cylindrical portion 20, with generatrices parallel to the axis of the pipes.<br>
On the other hand figure 2 shows a device used as a chemical reactor or heat exchanger in general, indicated as 110 as a whole, according to the present invention.<br>
In this figure the components which are the same as and/or equivalent to those illustrated in figure 1 have the same reference numbers increased by 100.<br>
More specifically, in the example illustrated, the device 110 comprises a pipe system 112 which is shown schematically in the figure. In preferred embodiments described by way of non-limiting example, this system 112 comprises pipes which are superimposed and is secured to a tube plate 114 disposed perpendicularly to the axis of the pipes.<br>
A chamber 116 which acts as a fluid distributor is connected to the tube plate 114. In the example, the chamber 116 is produced by means of a section in the shape of a "U", with a base 118 which is joined to the plate 114 by a cylindrical or lateral portion 120, with generatrices parallel to the axis of the pipes.<br>
In addition, in comparison with the device 10 according to the known art, the plate 114 of the device 110 according to the invention is connected at the base 118 of the chamber 116 both by means of the cylindrical portion 120 and by means of connection elements 122 which are disposed inside the cylindrical portion 120.<br>
In  figure  2  these  connection  elements  122  are<br>
cylindrical or flat portions with a shape similar to the lateral portion 120. The example shows one of these elements 122, disposed axially symmetrically relative to the axis of the pipe 112, although other configurations are not excluded.<br>
The functioning of the device 110 used as a chemical reactor or heat exchanger in general, according to the invention, is apparent from the foregoing description provided with reference to the figures, and briefly is as follows.<br>
In the case of the known art, the loads are transmitted entirely by the device 10 through the plate 14 to the cylindrical portion 20 of the chamber 16.<br>
In the case in figure 2 however, there is more efficient distribution of the loads.<br>
In fact, according to the present invention, the loads are transmitted by the device 110 through the plate 114, both to the cylindrical portion 120 and to the connection elements 122.<br>
It is thus possible to use thinner tube plates 114.<br>
The description provided makes apparent the characteristics of the device used as a chemical reactor or heat exchanger in general, with a thin tube plate, which is the subject of the present invention, as well as the corresponding advantages, which, it will be remembered, include:<br>
lower overall weights;<br>
simplification  of  the   installation  and  of<br>
retention of the tube bundle;<br>
lower overall costs and shorter construction times<br>
than in the known art; and<br>
simple, reliable and safe use.<br>
The invention can be applied to chemical reactors, petrochemical reactors, refinery reactors, heat exchangers, and in general to tube bundle-type pressure devices.<br>
Finally it is apparent that many modifications and variations, all of which come within the scope of the invention, can be made to the device thus designed, used as a chemical reactor or heat exchanger in general, with a thin tube plate; in addition all the details can be replaced by technically equivalent elements.<br>
In practice any materials, forms and dimensions can be used according to the technical requirements.<br>
The scope of the invention is thus delimited by the attached claims.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
