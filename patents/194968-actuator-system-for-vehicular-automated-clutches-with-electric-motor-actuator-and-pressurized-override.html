ACTUATOR SYSTEM FOR VEHICUCAR<br>
AUTOMATED CLUTCHES WITH<br>
ELECTRIC MOTOR ACTUATOR AND<br>
PRESSURIZED FLUID OVERRIDE<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to an actuator system for controlling a<br>
vehicular automated clutch and, in particular, relates to an actuator system.<br>
	utilizing an electric motor-controlled actuator and having a pressurized fluid-<br>
operated override mechanism for effecting rapid clutch movements not<br>
requiring precise controI.    In particular, a preferred embodiment of the<br>
present invention relates to an actuator system for a dry plate vehicular<br>
master clutch having an electric motor-controlled ball screw mechanism for<br>
	precision positioning of the clutch, as is required during vehicle launch<br>
conditions, and having a solenoid-controlled pneumatic override actuator for<br><br>
rapidly disengaging the clutch and/or for moving the clutch from a fully <br>
disengaged position to the touch point or point of incipient engagement<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE PRIOR ART<br>
	Automated vehicular master clutches and the controls and actuators<br>
therefor are known in the prior art, as may be seen by reference to U.S. Pats. No. 4,650,056; 4,638,898; 4,671,394; 4,712,658; 4,852,419; 4,874,070; 5,293,316; 5,314,050; 5,337,868 and 5,337,874, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference.   The automated<br>
20	clutches could be used with manual and/or fully or partially automated<br>
transmissions and could be used for dynamic shifting and/or vehicle launch (i.e., start-from-stop) operations, as may be seen by reference to U.S. Pats. No. 4,081,065; 4,361,060 and 4,648,290, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference.   As in known, vehicle launch and inching<br><br>
2	<br>
operations usually require more precise clutch control than is required during<br>
dynamic shifting operations.	New<br>
Typically, the prior art devices (included) a clutch control member<br>
moved in one direction to cause engagement and in the opposite direction<br>
	to cause disengagement of the controlled clutch.<br>
While the prior art clutch actuator mechanisms were generally satisfactory, they were subject to improvement, as it was difficult to obtain both the rapid actuator movement desired for dynamic disengagement and/or movement to the touch point, and the delicate, fine control desired for<br>
	inching   and   start-from-stop   operations.      While   electric   motor-based<br>
actuators, often associated with ball screw or ball ramp mechanisms, provided fine controls, they tended to be somewhat slow for disengagements and rapid movernent to the touch point, and while pneumatic controls, even when using both fine and coarse valving, gave<br>
	satisfactory speed, they were not as controllable as desired in certain<br>
situations.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
In accordance with the present invention, the drawbacks of the prior<br>
art are minimized or overcome by the provision of an actuator system for a<br>
        vehicular automated master clutch, such as a dry plate friction clutch,<br>
     comprising of an    electric    motor-actuated    actuator   for   controlling    both<br>
    engagement and disengagement movements of the clutch control member<br>
and a fluid-actuated override which is effective to override the electric<br>
motor-actuated actuator and control movement of the clutch control member<br>
	in only the disengagement direction of movement thereof relative to the<br>
position set by the electric motor-actuated actuator.<br>
Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a new<br>
and improved actuator assembly for an automated vehicular master clutch.<br>
This and other objects and advantages of the present invention will<br>
	become apparent from a reading of the following description of the preferred<br>
embodiment taken in connection with the attached drawings.<br><br>

	DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
A vehicular automated mechanical transmission system 10 of the type particularly well suited to utilize the clutch actuator system of the present invention is schematically illustrated in Fig. 1. Fully and partially automated mechanical transmission systems are well known in the prior art, as may be<br>
	seen by reference to U.S. Pats. No. 4,361,060; 4,648,290 and 5,136,897,<br>
the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference.        <br>
The vehicular automated mechanical transmission system 10 includes<br>
an automated multiple-speed, change-gear transmission 11 driven by a fuel-<br>
controlled engine E, such as a well-known diesel engine, through a coupling<br>
	such   as  a  friction   master  clutch   C.     The  output  of  the   automated<br>
transmission 11 is output shaft 12, which is adapted for driving connection to an appropriate vehicle component, such as the differential of a drive axle, a transfer case or the like, as is well known in the prior art.<br>
The crankshaft 20 of engine E will drive the driving plates 18 of<br>
	master friction clutch C, which are frictionally engageable to driven plates 22<br><br>
   for driving the input shaft 16 of transmission 11.<br>
    The aforementioned powertrain components are acted upon and/or<br>
monitoredjby several devices, each of which will be discussed briefly below.<br>
These devices include a throttle pedal position or throttle opening monitor<br>
	assembly 21, which senses the operator's set position of the operator-<br>
controlled throttle device THL, a fuel control device 23 for controlling the<br><br><br><br>
4	<br>
amount of fuel to be supplied to engine E, engine speed sensor 25 which<br>
senses rotational speed (ES) of the engine, clutch operator 27 which<br>
engages and disengages master clutch C, which also may provide<br>
information as to the status of a clutch, an input shaft speed sensor 28 for<br>
	sensing the rotational speed (IS) of the input shaft 16, a transmission<br>
operator 29, which is effective to shift the transmission 11 into a selected target gear ratio and/or to provide a signal indicative of the gear neutral and/or currently engaged gear ratio, and an output shaft speed sensor 30 for sensing the rotational speed (OS) of output shaft 12.<br>
	The aforementioned devices supply information to and/or accept<br>
command signals from the central processing unit or electronic processing unit 31. The central processing unit 31 may include)analog and/or digital electrical calculation and logic circuitry. Preferably, the central processing unit will be microprocessor based, an example of which may be seen by<br>
	reference   to   U.S.   Pat.   No.   4,595,986,   the   disclosure   of   which   is<br>
incorporated herein by reference.   The central processing unit 31 also will<br>
Now receive information from a shift control assembly 33 includling a manually<br>
operated shift lever 34, which may be selectively moved in the upshift (US) or downshift (DS) direction for selecting singular or multiple downshifts from<br>
	the currently engaged gear ratio.Alternately, the shift control assembly 33<br>
may be of a more standard "P-R-N-D-L" type or the like.<br>
Drive train components and controls therefor of the type described<br>
 above are well known in the prior art and may be appreciated in. greater<br>
detail by reference to U.S. Pats. No. 4,595,786; 4,576,065 and 4,445,393,<br>
	the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference.   The sensors<br>
may be of any known type of construction for generating analog or digital signals proportional to the parameters monitored thereby. Similarly, operators 23 and 29 may be of any known electric, hydraulic, pneumatic or electro-pneumatic type for executing operations in response to command<br>
	output signals from the central processing unit 31.<br>
The   clutch   actuator   system   27   of   the   present   invention   is schematically illustrated in Figs. 2 and 3.    Briefly, the clutch actuator<br><br><br>
system 27 receives command output signals from ECU 31 to control the<br>
engagement and disengagement of master friction clutch C.   The clutch<br><br>
actuator system 27 includes a clutch actuator mechanism 40 having a clutch<br><br>
control member 42 movable leftwardly (D) to cause disengagement of<br>
	clutch C and rightwardly (E) to cause engagement of clutch C.    Briefly,<br>
control member 42 acts through a pivoted clutch release lever 44 pivoted at<br>
pivot point 46 and engaging a clutch release bearing 48 in a known manner.<br>
Although the present invention is illustrated in connection with a so-called<br>
"push" type clutch, with appropriate rearrangement, it is equally applicable<br>
	to "pull" type clutches.<br>
 Referring to Fig. 3, the clutch control mechanism 40 is contained within a housing 50 having an enlarged diameter bore 52 slidably and sealingly receiving an enlarged piston 54 axially fixed to the clutch control member 42..   The enlarged piston 54 includes a piston face 56 exposed to<br>
	fluid pressure in a chamber 58 defined by the piston face 56 and the<br>
enlarged diameter bore 52. The housing also comprises a small diameter bore 60 slidably and sealingly receiving a smaller diameter piston 62. Smaller piston 62 has a rightwardly facing face 64 exposed to fluid pressure in a chamber 66 defined by the smaller diameter bore 60 and the piston <br>
	face 64. The smaller diameter piston 62 has a leftwardly facing surface (66)<br>
            56<br>
for abutting engagement with the rightward surface of the enlarged diameter<br>
piston  54. . Pistons  54 and  62 are  independently axially  movable  in<br>
 housing 50.   A compression spring 68 resiliently biases the piston 54 and<br>
control member 42 rightwardly into engagement with the smaller diameter<br>
	piston 62.<br>
Piston chamber 58 is connected to a selectively pressurized and exhausted pneumatic conduit 70, While piston chamber 66 is connected by<br><br>
	a conduit (72) 70 to a source of pressurized hydraulic fluid.   As may be seen,<br>
leftward axial movements of the piston 62 will result in corresponding<br>
        1 movements of piston 54 and control member 42 therewith.   While, due to<br>
the incompressibility of hydraulic fluid, rightward axial movements of the<br>
piston 54 and control member  42 will be,limited.to the position.permitted-by<br><br>
6	<br>
abutment with the face (66) 56 of the smaller diameter piston 62. However,<br>
upon pressurization of chamber 58, developing a force sufficient to<br>
overcome the rightward biasing force of spring 68, the piston 54 and control<br>
member 42 are free to move leftwardly relative to the piston 62 and, upon<br>
	exhaust of chamber 58, wilt return rightwardly under the bias of spring 68<br>
to contact the piston 62.<br>
As illustrated in Fig. 2 and as described in greater detail below,<br>
pressurization of chamber 66 and, thus, the position of piston 62 are<br>
controlled   by  controlled   rotation   of  an   electric   motor,   whereas  the<br>
	pressurization of chamber 58 and, thus, the leftward axial position of<br>
piston 54 and control member 42 are controlled by one or more solenoid-controlled pneumatic valves. Hydraulic conduit 70 is connected to a relatively standard hydraulic master cylinder 74 having a connection to a<br>
hydraulic reservoir 76 and including an hydraulic piston 78 axially positioned<br>
	by a pivoted hydraulic piston lever 80, which is pivotably positioned by a ball<br>
nut 82 threadably attached to a ball screw 84 selectively rotated in both the<br>
clockwise and counterclockwise directions by an electric DC motor 86.  The<br>
electric DC motor is selectively operated under the commands of output<br>
signals from ECU 31.  Ball screw and ball ramp mechanisms are well known<br>
	in the prior art and include a ball nut axially movable in response to rotation<br>
of the ball screw.  Bearing balls are used in interengaged threads to minimize<br>
friction and to transfer loads.  Ball screw and ball ramp mechanisms may be<br>
appreciated in greater detail by reference to U.S. Pats. No. 4,981,202; 4,966,267 and 5,528,950, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein<br>
	by referense.  Ball screw mechanisms, thus, will provide fine control of the<br>
axial position of the smaller piston 62 in both the disengaged (D) and engaged (E) positions of the clutch control member 42, as is desirable during vehicle launch and/or inching operations;<br>
The pressurization and/or exhaust of conduit 72 for selectively<br>
	pressurizing and/or exhausting piston chamber 58 is controlled by a solenoid-<br>
controlled valve assembly 90 connected to a source 92 of pressurized air, such as filtered and regulated air from an onboard vehicle compressor or the<br><br><br>
like The solenoid-controlled valve assembly 90 also operates in response to command output signals from ECU 31.<br>
Although the electric motor ball screw mechanism is illustrated as<br>
positioning the piston 62 through an hydraulic actuator, the piston 62 could<br>
	be replaced by a member selectively axially positioned directly by the ball nut<br>
or by the ball nut through a mechanical linkage.<br>
Thus, it may be seen that precision positioning of the clutch is accomplished by means of the hydraulically operated cylinder 62 under the control of the motor 86 and the ball screw mechanism, whereas when rapid<br>
	disengagement of the clutch is desired, pressurization of conduit 72 and,<br>
thus, piston chamber 58 under the control of the solenoid valve assembly 90 will achieve a rapid disengagement of the clutch, regardless of the position of the small cylinder 62. Preferably, upon disengagement of the clutch by means of pressurizing chamber 58, the ECU will command the DC motor and<br>
	ball screw mechanism to adjust the supply of hydraulic fluid in chamber 66<br>
such that the piston 62 will be allowed to move rightwardly to the touch point or point of incipient engagement whereby when it is desirable to reengage the clutch C, exhaust of chamber 72 will cause the spring 68 to move the piston 54 rightwardly until the piston 54 will engage the piston 62<br>
	at the point of incipient engagement, at which time the electric motor and<br>
ball screw mechanism may be utilized to cause an accurate reengagement of the master clutch C.<br>
Accordingly, it may be seen that a master clutch actuator system has been provided for an automated master clutch which allows precise control<br>
	of the  master  clutch  as  necessary  during  vehicle  launch  and  inching<br>
operations, while permitting rapid disengagement of the master clutch when desired and rapid return of the master clutch to the point of incipient engagement during reengagement of the master clutch operations.<br>
Although the present invention has been described with a certain<br>
	degree of particularity, it is understood that the description of the preferred<br>
embodiment is by way of example only and that numerous changes to form<br><br>
