				<td>WATERPROOF VAPOR-PERMEABLE MULTILAYER ARTICLE<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to  a waterproof vapor-permeable<br>
multilayer article.<br>
Background Art<br>
Waterproof vapor-permeable multilayer articles, constituted in<br>
practice by a membrane based on polytetrafluoroethylene, are currently<br>
known particularly in the field of shoes and clothing.<br>
Such membrane is coupled to the fabrics that compose the item of<br>
clothing in order to allow correct permeation of the water vapor that forms<br>
due to perspiration released by the body within the environment delimited<br>
by the item of clothing.<br>
At the same time, the item of clothing must allow correct<br>
waterproofing, with the same goal of keeping the body dry.<br>
The same occurs for shoes: membranes of this type are associated<br>
with the upper and with the sole of the shoe; in this regard, it should be<br>
noted that most of the perspiration of the foot originates at the interface<br>
between the sole of the foot and the sole of the shoe.<br>
Currently known membranes, though having been used now for<br>
several years and being unanimously acknowledged as being capable of<br>
ensuring correct waterproofing and optimum permeability to water vapor<br>
and air, nonetheless have aspects that can be improved.<br>
These membranes are scarcely resistant, and in fact they can tear<br>
easily: to give them strength, they are therefore coupled, generally by<br>
lamination, to a supporting mesh made of plastic material, which inevitably<br>
reduces their permeability to water vapor or air.<br>
In any case, coupling to the mesh is not sufficient to achieve<br>
acceptable strength characteristics.<br>
In view of the limited consistency of these membranes, it is evident<br>
that such membranes are not capable of being self-supporting.<br><br>
For this reason, for example in soles, the membrane (which is<br>
integrated with the mesh) must be coupled to supports that are capable of<br>
supporting it adequately.<br>
Moreover, it should be noted that when, for any particular reason,<br>
perspiration condenses inside the environment to be kept dry, which is<br>
delimited by said membranes, such perspiration can no longer be expelled,<br>
causing an unpleasant "wet" effect.<br>
Disclosure of the Invention<br>
The aim of the present invention is to provide a waterproof vapor-<br>
permeable multilayer article that solves the drawbacks noted in known<br>
types.<br>
Within this aim, an object of the present invention is to provide a<br>

vapor-permeable multilayer article that is capable of being self-supporting.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a waterproof<br>

systems and technologies.<br>
This aim and these and other objects of the present invention that will<br>
become better apparent hereinafter are achieved by a waterproof vapor-<br>
permeable multilayer article, characterized in that it comprises at least one<br>
first layer made of a material that is vapor-permeable and microporous and<br>
is at least partially hygroscopic or can assume hygroscopic properties over<br>
time, and at least one second layer that is waterproof and vapor-permeable.<br>
Brief Description of the Drawings<br>
Further characteristics and advantages of the invention will become<br>
better apparent from the description of two preferred but not exclusive<br><br>
embodiments thereof, illustrated hereinafter by way of non-limiting example<br>
in the accompanying drawing, wherein:<br>
Figure 1 is a sectional view of a first embodiment of a multilayer<br>
article according to the invention;<br>
Figure 2 is a sectional view of a variation of the multilayer article of<br>
Figure 1;<br>
Figure 3 is a sectional view of a second embodiment of a multilayer<br>
article according to the invention;<br>
Figure 4 is a sectional view of a variation of the multilayer article of<br>
Figure 3.<br>
Ways of carrying out the Invention<br>
With reference to the first embodiment, shown in Figure 1, a<br>
waterproof vapor-permeable multilayer article according to the invention is<br>
generally designated by the reference numeral 10.<br>
The multilayer article 10 comprises a first layer 11, made of a<br>
material that is vapor-permeable, microporous and hygroscopic, and a<br>
second layer 12, which is waterproof and vapor-permeable.<br>
The first layer 11 is constituted for example by a hygroscopic material<br>
based on polyolefin and filler particles.<br>
The filler particles are designed to create the micropores that allow<br>
permeability to vapor or air.<br>
The polyolefin that is used in the example being described has a very<br>
high molecular weight; for this reason, such polyolefin is preferably a<br>
UHMW (ultra high molecular weight) polyethylene.<br>
The characteristics of a UHMW polyolefin are referred to a polyolefin<br>
with an average molecular weight of at least 500.000 g/mole.<br>
Preferably, the average molecular weight is comprised between 4x106<br>
g/mole and 7x106 g/mole.<br>
The preferred filler is a finely milled silica (silicon dioxide, SiO2).<br><br>
Silica has an important hygroscopic capacity, to the full advantage of<br>
the hygroscopic properties of the first layer 11.<br>
The optimum average diameter of the filler particles of silicon<br>
dioxide SiO2 are comprised between 0.01 and 20 urn, while the average<br>
surface area of said fillers is comprised between 30 m2/g and 950 m2/g.<br>
Preferably, the average surface area of the filler particles is at least<br>
100 m7g.<br>
The first layer 11 being described has a pore size of less than 1 µm in<br>
diameter.<br>
Preferably, over 50% of the pores have a diameter of less than 0.5<br>
µm.<br>
Porosity understood as:<br>
Porosity = [1 — (apparent membrane density / resin density)] x 100<br>
is preferably at least 50%.<br>
The first layer 11 is for example treated with antibacterial and/or<br>
fungicidal agents.<br>
The preferred final form is a sheet of preset thickness, substantially<br>
comprised between 200 µm and 1.5 cm; in particular, between 200 and 600<br>
µm.<br>
A microporous membrane known by the trade-name DARAMIC® and<br>
manufactured by DARAMIC Inc. (Norderstedt, Germany) has the<br>
characteristics described above for the first layer 11 and therefore can be<br>
used to form a multilayer article according to the invention.<br>
Such microporous membrane is per se known and is currently used as<br>
a partition in accumulators and batteries and is provided in sheet form.<br>
The characteristics of the membrane are disclosed in US-3,351,495<br>
(in the name of W R GRACE &amp; Co.) and US-6,139,759 (in the name of<br>
Daramic Inc.).<br>
The version with a thickness of 600 µm of said DARAMIC®<br>
membrane has an ultimate tensile strength of substantially 5.8 MPa and a<br><br>
maximum breaking elongation of 505% (according to ISO 37): accordingly,<br>
it has excellent strength characteristics.<br>
In this first described embodiment, the second layer 12, which is<br>
waterproof and vapor-permeable, is constituted by a hydrophobic<br>
microporous material based on polypropylene (where the term<br>
"polypropylene" is used to designate any polymer, homopolymer or<br>
copolymer originating from propylene monomers).<br>
Preferably, the polypropylene of the second layer 12 is an isotactic<br>
homopolymer with low affinity for the absorption of proteins and fats.<br>
A hydrophobic membrane known by the trade-name CELGARD® of<br>
the company CELGARD Inc. has the characteristics described above for the<br>
second layer 12 and therefore can be used to form a multilayer article<br>
according to the invention.<br>
The coupling between the first layer 11 and the second layer 12<br>
occurs depending on the type of "appearance" that said layers have at the<br>
time of coupling.<br>
For example, if both the first layer 11 and the second layer 12 are in<br>
sheet form, they can be coupled by applying spots of adhesive, so as to<br>
avoid creating a compact layer, or by using known high-frequency or<br>
ultrasound technologies, avoiding the subtraction of breathable surface.<br>
An alternative is for example to spread or roll one layer onto the<br>
other, which is considered as a backing.<br>
In this case, the spread layer must strongly adhere to the underlying<br>
backing so as to resist separation.<br>
Moreover, such layer must have the characteristic of being easy to<br>
form or place on the underlying layer by means of large-scale spreading and<br>
rolling techniques.<br>
The polymeric polyethylene layer of the DARAMIC® membrane can<br>
be suitable for spreading, since its molecular weight is high enough to<br>
prevent its penetration into the pores of the microporous support, or can be<br><br>
dispersed in aggregates that are larger than the pores of the CELGARD®<br>
polypropylene membrane.<br>
For example, one method for producing a multilayer article according<br>
to the invention is as follows:<br>
-	a solution or dispersion of the basic polymeric mix for the first<br>
layer 11 in a volatile organic liquid with low surface tension is<br>
prepared in order to produce a spreading solution that has a certain<br>
viscosity;<br>
-	the solution is applied by spreading to the surface of the sheet of<br>
the second layer 12 that acts as a backing, in order to form a<br>
coating layer on its surface;<br>
-	the volatile components of the spread are made to evaporate in<br>
order to promote the cross-linking reaction of the spread surface;<br>
-	the coating is dried in order to remove the residual humidity to<br>
produce the laminated article.<br>
It is evident that one or more additional layers of polymer can be<br>
applied likewise and dried in order to reach the intended thicknesses.<br>
The solution of the polymer can be applied to the backing made of<br>
hydrophobic microporous membrane by means of standard spreading<br>
techniques that are known in the background art, for example roller<br>
spreading or spray spreading.<br>
One variation to the basic configuration of the multilayer article 10<br>
composed of two individual layers is shown in Figure 2.<br>
In this variation, the multilayer article according to the invention,<br>
generally designated by the reference numeral 100, is composed of a first<br>
layer 111 made of vapor-permeable microporous hygroscopic material,<br>
which is delimited in a sandwich-like fashion by two second layers 112 that<br>
are waterproof and vapor-permeable.<br>
It is evident that the first layer 111 and the second layers 112<br>
respectively have the same characteristics described earlier for the first layer<br><br>
11 and the second layer 12.<br>
Moreover, it is evident that other variations may have<br>
superimpositions of one or more of said first and second layers, combined<br>
according to the requirements.<br>
A second layer 12 (or 112) can also be provided by spreading a<br>
fluoropolymer on a first microporous layer 11 (or 111) or optionally a<br>
polysiloxane.<br>
For example, such fluoropolymer is the one commercially known by<br>
the trade name Zonyl® and manufactured by DuPont.<br>
The second layer 12 (or 112) can also be provided by immersing the<br>
first layer 11 (or lll)ina bath of a fluoropolyrner (for example Zonyl®) or<br>
of a polysiloxane.<br>
A second embodiment (see Figure 3) of a multilayer article according<br>
to the invention, generally designated by the reference numeral 200, has a<br>
first layer 211 such as the one described in the above examples and has, as<br>
its second layer, designated here by the reference numeral 212, a film<br>
obtained by means of a plasma deposition treatment.	<br>
The idea of the film by plasma deposition arises from the surprising<br>
experimental discovery that a vapor of a siloxane organic compound can be <br>
used to produce an ultrathin layer on a microporous backing material by <br>
"cold plasma" polymerization in high vacuum at ambient temperature,<br>
providing   waterproofing   characteristics   without   altering   the   general<br>
characteristics  and particularly the permeability  characteristics  of the<br>
backing material.<br>
A waterproof and breathable hydrophobic layer can in fact be<br>
provided by plasma polymerization for example of a monomer based on<br>
siloxane, by depositing a layer of polymer (polysiloxane) on a microporous<br>
backing material (for example made of polyethylene or polystyrene).<br>
This deposition can also be performed for example by using oil-<br>
repellent and water-repellent fluoropolymers such as those produced by<br><br>
DuPont and registered with the trade name Zonyl®.<br>
Plasma is divided into hot and cold depending on the temperatures<br>
reached; it is also divided into ambient-pressure plasma and vacuum plasma.<br>
In a cold plasma process to obtain a film according to the present<br>
invention, a gaseous or vaporized precursor compound is introduced in a<br>
reaction chamber at a very low pressure (in vacuum conditions).<br>
A plasma condition is generated by energizing the precursor inside<br>
the reaction chamber by generating an electrical field.<br>
The result is an ultrathin layer of the polymer, which adheres to, and<br>
is deposited on, the entire surface of any substrate material introduced in the<br>
reaction chamber.<br>
The plasma polymerization process is started and performed by means<br>
of an electrical field so as to achieve breakdown of the precursor of the<br>
deposition layer within the reaction chamber.<br>
Once breakdown has occurred, ions and reactive species are formed<br>
which begin and produce the atomic and molecular reactions that ultimately<br>
form thin films.<br>
Layers created by plasma polymerization can use various<br>
configurations of electrical fields and different reaction parameters.<br>
The thickness of the layer is controlled by selecting the initial<br>
polymerizable material and the reaction conditions, such as the deposition<br>
time of the monomer, the treatment time, the electrical frequency at which<br>
the reaction is performed, and the power used.<br>
In the present invention, plasma polymerization is performed in<br>
vacuum.<br>
The typical pressure range is between 10-1 and 10-5 mbar.<br>
The precursor is made to react in its pure state by using a non-<br>
polymerizable inert gas, such as for example argon; such inert gas is used<br>
both as an inert dilution agent and as a carrier gas that assists the<br>
polymerization of the precursor.<br><br>
Other gases that can be used are any of oxygen, helium, nitrogen,<br>
neon, xenon and ammonia.<br>
The precursor must have a vapor pressure that is sufficient to be able<br>
to vaporize in a moderate vacuum.<br>
The plasma deposition process begins by loading the backing material<br>
to be coated (in this case, the first layer 212) into the reaction chamber and<br>
then bringing the chamber to the intended vacuum pressure.<br>
Once the vacuum pressure has been reached, the plasma<br>
polymerization reaction or a pretreatment reaction can begin.<br>
The plasma polymerization reaction occurs by producing the<br>
discharge that generates the plasma and by injecting the vaporized precursor<br>
monomer into the reaction chamber.<br>
A pretreatment reaction is required when the surface of the first layer<br>
is to be cleaned by subjecting it to an inert gas such as argon or nitrogen in<br>
order to clean the surface or promote the adhesion of the polymer film.<br>
During the plasma generating discharge, the collision of the monomer<br>
with the ions and electrons of the plasma allows polymerization of the<br>
monomer.<br>
The resulting polymer is deposited on the exposed surfaces inside the<br>
chamber.<br>
The properties of the film are not just a function of the structure of the<br>
monomer but also a function of the discharge frequency, of the power used,<br>
of the monomer flow-rate and, of the pressure.<br>
Porosity, surface morphology and permeability can vary according to<br>
the reaction conditions.<br>
The deposition process ends when the intended thickness of deposited<br>
material is reached.<br>
Owing to the fact that the first layer 212 is made of insulating<br>
material (polyethylene, for example, is one of the most insulating materials<br>
known), in order to maintain the plasma conditions it is necessary to apply<br><br>
to the process a radiofrequency generator in order to make the electrical<br>
field in the treatment oscillate with a frequency substantially on the order of<br>
13.56 MHz, with an applied electric field power substantially equal to 50-<br>
700 watts and a vacuum level comprised between 10-1 and 10-5 mbar.<br>
As regards the duration of the treatment, it has been observed that for<br>
a precursor such as a siloxane monomer, the optimum time is substantially<br>
comprised between 160 and 600 seconds; in particular, an optimum duration<br>
of substantially 420 seconds has been identified.<br>
One variation to the basic configuration of the multilayer article 200<br>
composed of two individual layers is shown in Figure 4.<br>
In this variation, the multilayer article according to the invention,<br>
generally designated by the reference numeral 300, is composed of a first<br>
layer 311 made of vapor-permeable and hygroscopic microporous material,<br>
which is delimited in a sandwich-like fashion by two seconds layers 312,<br>
which are waterproof and vapor-permeable.<br>
It is evident that the first layer 311 and the second layers 312<br>
respectively have the same characteristics described earlier for the first layer<br>
211 and the second layer 212.<br>
Moreover, it is evident that other variations may have<br>
superimpositions of one or more of the first and second layers, combined<br>
according to the requirements.<br>
In practice it has been observed that the invention thus described<br>
solves the problems noted in known types of waterproof and vapor-<br>
permeable multilayer article.<br>
A multilayer article has in fact been provided which associates a first<br>
microporous and hygroscopic layer with a second hydrophobic layer, said<br>
layers preventing the inflow of any liquid phase while allowing the transfer<br>
of water vapor and other volatile components.<br>
The silicon-based filler provided inside the first layer in order to<br>
generate the microporous structure is a highly hygroscopic material that has<br><br>
a great tendency to absorb water: accordingly, the first layer is not<br>
appropriate to be used individually as a waterproof layer, but is very useful<br>
for conveying perspiration and moisture away from the body (the torso or<br>
legs in the case of clothing, the feet in the case of shoes).<br>
Moreover, since the first hygroscopic layer and the second<br>
hydrophobic layer are both structurally stronger than the membranes<br>
currently used and are thicker, they can be used in combination without<br>
backings that reduce their permeability to vapor or air.<br>
In this regard, since the multilayer article (10, 100, 200, 300 et cetera)<br>
has structural characteristics, it can be used as a supporting structure of a<br>
shoe; for example, in combination with a tread that has upward openings,<br>
the multilayer article can be used as a supporting element of a breathable<br>
and waterproof sole.<br>
Such layers can be coupled, depending on the requirements, by<br>
applying spots of adhesive so as to avoid creating a compact layer or by<br>
using known high-frequency or ultrasound technologies, avoiding the<br>
subtraction of breathable surface, or by spreading or rolling of one layer<br>
onto the other.<br>
In this regard, since the first layer is the one that reaches greater<br>
thicknesses without compromising vapor and air permeability, by using it as<br>
a backing for the plasma deposition of a waterproof breathable film, it is<br>
possible to achieve the same above mentioned aim and objects by pairing<br>
the two layers by spreading, rolling or adhesive bonding.<br>
It should be noted that the use of plasma deposition solves the<br>
problems of conformity and adhesion of the first layer on the second layer,<br>
since the plasma-deposited polymer adheres to the backing layer for a<br>
longer time than, for example, a conventional spreading.<br>
Moreover, since the waterproof film is deposited in partial vacuum<br>
conditions, and since the backing material can be cleaned in the reaction<br>
chamber beforehand with argon with a high degree of purity, any impurities<br><br>
that could generate fractures, discontinuities, distortions of the deposited<br>
waterproof film are completely avoided.<br>
The invention thus conceived is susceptible of numerous<br>
modifications and variations, all of which are within the scope of the<br>
appended claims; all the details may further be replaced with other<br>
technically equivalent elements.<br>
In practice, the materials used, so long as they are compatible with the<br>
specific use, as well as the dimensions, may be any according to<br>
requirements and to the state of the art.<br>
