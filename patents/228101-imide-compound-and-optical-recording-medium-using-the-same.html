				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
IMIDE COMPOUND AND<br>
OPTICAL RECORDING MEDIUM USING THE SAME<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to an optical recording medium, and<br>
more specifically, an optical recording medium capable of writing and reading<br>
by a visible laser, a blue laser beam In addition, the present invention<br>
relates to a novel imide compound<br>
Background Art<br>
As a recordable optical recording medium corresponding to the<br>
specifications of a compact disk (hereinafter simply referred to as a "CD"), a<br>
CD-R (CD-Recordable) has been widely spread The storage capacity of<br>
the CD-R is about 680 MB However, with a drastic increase of the<br>
information volume, demands for higher density and larger storage capacity<br>
in an information recording medium have been increased<br>
As a means for achieving higher density of a recording medium, it is<br>
considered to decrease a beam spot by using a shorter-wavelength laser in<br>
writing and reading and increasing a numerical aperture (N A ) of an object<br>
lens As the short-wavelength laser for use in an optical disk system, red<br>
laser beams of 500 to 700 nm, further 630 to 690 nm, more specifically, 680,<br>
670, 660, 650, and 635 nm have been put to practical use Thus, by virtue<br>
of techniques for reducing the wavelength of a semiconductor laser,<br>
increasing the numerical aperture of an object lens, and compressing data,<br><br>
an optical recording medium capable of recording a motion picture and large<br>
volumetric information has been successfully produced. Examples of optical<br>
recording media proposed up to the present include a magneto-optical<br>
recording medium, phase change recording medium, chalcogen oxide-based<br>
optical recording medium, and organic dye-based optical recording medium<br>
Of them, the organic dye-based optical recording medium is considered<br>
preferential in view of low cost and easy processing. In consideration of<br>
these circumstances, the one developed as an optical recording medium<br>
capable of recording and regenerating a motion picture with the same quality<br>
level as that of TV and with a higher density than that of CD and as a<br>
recordable optical recording medium capable of regenerating by a<br>
commercially available DVD video player or a DVD-ROM player that have<br>
been widely used and capable of recording by a rea semiconductor laser<br>
having an oscillation wavelength of 630 to 690 nm is a recordable digital<br>
versatile disc (hereinafter, simply referred to as a "DVD-R"). DVD-R is a<br>
write-once optical recording medium having a 3.9 or 4.7 GB storage capacity.<br>
In particular, only recently, a DVD-R medium having a single-side capacity of<br>
4.7 GB has been brought into a market. Such a DVD-R medium also<br>
employs a stacked structure, which is formed of a recording layer containing<br>
a cyanine-based dye, azo-based dye, or the like, and a reflecting layer, is<br>
characterized by a disk structure formed by adhering two substrates of 0.6<br>
mm thick. Regarding such an optical disk having satisfactory recording<br>
characteristics suitable for this capacity, development of a medium applicable<br>
to high-speed recording has been aggressively made at present.<br>
Furthermore, it has been estimated that a further higher density<br><br>
recording will be desired in future and that the amount of data stored in a<br>
single disk will reach up to 15 to 30 GB To attain such a recording density,<br>
a further shorter-wavelength laser will be inevitably used Accordingly, as a<br>
recording dye suitable for an on-coming organic dye-based optical recording<br>
medium, it is desired to develop a dye having good recording characteristics<br>
within the wavelength range of 300 to 500 nm<br>
In the meantime, regarding a medium attaining high-density recording<br>
more excellent than DVD-R using an organic dye in a recording layer,<br>
Japanese Patent Laid-Open No 10-302310 discloses that a recording<br>
density having a storage capacity of 8 GB or more is attained by using a<br>
laser having an oscillation wavelength of 680 nm or less This publication<br>
suggests that a large storage capacity of 8 GB or more should be attained by<br>
converging laser light of 680 nm or less through an object lens having a high<br>
numerical aperture of 0 7 or more via a light transmission layer of 10 to 177<br>
pm thick.<br>
On the other hand, only in recent years, as a blue laser having an<br>
oscillation wavelength of 390 to 430 nm, a laser of 410 nm using a GaN-<br>
based material and an SHG laser of 425 nm wavelength, which is obtained<br>
by combining a semiconductor laser and an optical wave guide element,<br>
have been developed (for example, January 26 Issue of Nikkei Electronics,<br>
No. 708, p 117, 1998) Thus, development of blue semiconductor laser<br>
applicable dyes suitably used in such a laser is now proceeding.<br>
Furthermore, Nichia Corporation started supply of a GaN-based<br>
semiconductor laser emitting bluish-violet light having an oscillation<br>
wavelength of 400 to 410 nm from the beginning of 1999 Since then,<br><br>
studies on a medium having a high-density storage capacity of 15 GB or<br>
more per side (hereinafter referred to as an "HD-DVD-R medium") and<br>
capable of recording a motion picture having the same image-quality level as<br>
that of a high definition television (HDTV) for about 2 hours have been<br>
started Such an HD-DVD-R medium is capable of recording motion<br>
pictures for about 6 hours with the same image-quality level as those<br>
currently on air and therefore attracted attention also as a new recording<br>
medium in place of a home VTR Already now, technical outline of a<br>
proposal for a medium using an inorganic recording film of a phase change<br>
system has been introduced in September 6 Issue of Nikkei Electronics, No<br>
751, p 117(1999)<br>

Further, the optical recording media are proposed including an optical<br>
recording medium described in Japanese Patent Laid-Open No 11-53758,<br>
which is formed of two layers, one is a recording layer primarily containing a<br>
porphyrin-based dye or cyanine-based dye as an organic dye for forming the<br>
recording layer and the other is a metal reflecting layer primarily containing<br><br>
silver, an optical recording medium described in Japanese Patent Laid-Open<br>
No 11 -203729 which attains writing in 2 wavelength regions by devising the<br>
constitution of a medium, that is, using a medium having a blue laser<br>
responsive dye layer containing a cyanine-based dye responsible to a blue<br>
laser and a red laser responsive dye layer, an optical recording medium<br>
using an indigold-based dye compound described in Japanese Patent Laid-<br>
Open No 11 -78239 which attaining writing in two wavelength regions by<br>
mixing two types of dyes, that is, a dye for a blue laser and a dye for a red<br>
laser, an optical recording medium using a cyanoethene-based dye<br>
described in Japanese Patent Laid-Open No 11-105423, and an optical<br>
recording medium using a squarylium-based dye compound described in<br>
Japanese Patent Laid-Open No 11-110815<br>
On the other hand, as examples for using an organic dye film for<br>
writing within the blue region of 400 to 500 nm, Japanese Patent Laid-Open<br>
Nos. 7-304256 and 7-304257 have suggested to mix a molecular compound<br>
coordinated to the central metal of a porphyrin-based compound and a<br>
polymer or a polymer having a molecular structure having a central metal<br>
coordinated as a side chain, thereby shifting the Soret zone of the porphyrin-<br>
based compound toward a long wavelength range so as to correspond to an<br>
Ar laser of 488 nm, and simultaneously to reduce manufacturing cost by<br>
achieving film formation by spin coating Furthermore, Japanese Patent<br>
L aid-Open Nos 4-78576 and 4-89279 disclose polyene-based color<br>
compounds, which are, however, poor in light stability according to the<br>
studies by the present inventors, and required some modifications, for<br>
example, blending of a quencher or the like, to put them to practical use<br><br>
As the recent circumstances, since the prospect of putting a bluish-<br>
violet semiconductor laser of 400 to 410 nm wavelength to practical use is<br>
given, development of a high-capacity recordable optical recording medium<br>
using the laser has been aggressively made and particularly development of<br>
dyes having excellent light stability and high-speed recording characteristics<br>
has been desired<br>
However, the optical recording media mentioned above are actually<br>
insufficient to be subjected to the laser light having a wavelength of 400 to<br>
410 nm More specifically, the media using the organic dyes mentioned<br>
above have a problem in that when recorded signal data is read out, the<br>
read-out of a signal is not satisfactory performed, since the ratio of carrier to<br>
noise (C/N) is not always proper Therefore, development of an optical<br>
recording medium capable of overcoming this problem and writing and<br>
reading high-density data by a laser beam of 400 to 410 nm wavelength has<br>
been urgent need<br>
As a result of studies conducted by the present inventors on recording<br>
materials suitable for an optical recording medium, the following two findings<br>
were obtained<br>
(1)	Since a large capacity optical recording medium uses a laser beam<br>
of 300 to 500 nm in writing and reading data, it is important to control the<br>
absorption coefficient, refractive index, and reflectivity of the recording<br>
medium in the vicinity of the laser wavelength.<br>
(2)	As mentioned above, although large-capacity optical recording<br>
media using the laser have been aggressively developed and particularly the<br>
development of a dye having excellent light stability and good high-speed<br><br>
recording characteristics has been desired, the dye compounds mentioned<br>
above have not yet satisfied recording characteristics as a recording material<br>
capable of reading and writing data with a laser beam of the wavelength<br>
range and thus still need to be improved at present Furthermore, as a<br>
favorable characteristic of a dye for use in a medium manufactured by a<br>
coating method, such as spin coating, which is a simple method for forming a<br>
recording film, the high solubility of the dye to a coating solvent must be<br>
considered<br>
Also, in general, to increase the storage capacity, higher-density<br>
recording must be performed To attain this, it is necessary to increase the<br>
numerical aperture of an object lens in order to converge an optical beam for<br>
use in recording and generate a shorter-wavelength laser by an optical<br>
system. However, when an optical beam is converged, the minimum beam<br>
diameter is determined by its diffraction-limit<br>
In the meantime, since writing is made when the intensity of beam<br>
exceeds a certain threshold, the record pit obtained is smaller than the beam<br>
spot converged, as shown in Figure 1 (a) The periphery of the record pit<br>
corresponds to the skirts of the intensity peak. Under the present<br>
circumstances where a further shorter wavelength laser is developed, a<br>
photochemical reaction in the recording layer is facilitated even in the<br>
periphery of the record pit In particular, in the wavelength range of the<br>
aforementioned bluish-violet laser, a photochemical reaction of an organic<br>
compound is likely to occur, producing a problem a pit edge is degraded<br>
during writing time, decreasing signal characteristics To explain more<br>
specifically, recoding data which must be essentially written in response to a<br><br>
rectangular wave [indicated by a solid line in Figure 1(b)], as shown in Figure<br>
1(b), results in a broader tailed wave form (indicated by a broken line in<br>
Figure 1 (b) due to the deterioration of the pit edge Furthermore, when<br>
regeneration is performed by the same bluish-violet laser wavelength as in<br>
recording, a photo reaction is facilitated even by weak light irradiation such<br>
as regeneration light As a result, deterioration proceeds every time<br>
regeneration is performed. Against such a problem, Japanese Patent Laid-<br>
Open Nos 7-304256 and 7-304257 take measures by varying the<br>
wavelength of recording light from that of regeneration light, virtually, using a<br>
longer wavelength light as regeneration light than recording light As a<br>
result, the requirement for high-density recording has not yet sufficiently<br>
satisfied up to present Furthermore, using recording light and regeneration<br>
light different in wavelength means that a recording device and a<br>
regeneration device must be separately prepared or means that two optical<br>
systems and control systems must be provided in a single apparatus, with<br>
the result that such an optical recording medium is limited in use and entails<br>
enlargement of the apparatus, increase of cost, and losing general versatility<br>
Furthermore, in a conventional optical recording medium such as CD-R,<br>
on/off of writing can be determined based on whether or not reaching thermal<br>
threshold on physical characteristics such as melting point, sublimation point,<br>
phase transition point or thermo-decomposition point of an organic dye film.<br>
However, such a contrast is made indistinctive by optical deterioration due to<br>
excitation of a bluish-violet laser. In particular, in a high-density recording<br>
system in which recording pits must be formed smaller than that of an optical<br>
beam, there is a possibility that the quality of a recording signal may<br><br>
significantly decrease<br>
Now, as a case where an organic dye film is used in recording in the<br>
visible light range of 400 to 700 nm, Published Japanese translations of PCT<br>
international publication No 2002-501497 describes a writable and erasable<br>
optical recording medium using a perylene-based compound. Further,<br>
Japanese Patent Laid-Open No 10-6645 describes a laser beam of 620 to<br>
690 nm wavelength used on a medium using a perylene compound analogue<br>
in the recording layer However, it was found that these compounds are still<br>
insufficient with respect to light stability and signal characteristics when a<br>
bluish-violet laser of 400 to 410 nm wavelength is used for writing<br>
Also, as an optical recording medium using an organic dye, on which<br>
recording can be made by a laser of 400 to 500 nm wavelength, Japanese<br>
Patent Laid-Open No 2000-113504 describes an optical recording medium<br>
using a naphthalene imide compound However, it was found that the<br>
compound was still unsatisfactory in light stability and the recording medium<br>
thus required further improvement.<br>
Disclosure of the Invention<br>

medium which has a recording layer suitable for very high density recording<br>

Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to an optical recording medium<br>
characterized by containing an imide compound of the present invention in a<br>
recording layer thereof, and a novel optical recording medium capable of<br>
writing and reading by a laser beam selected from the wavelength range of<br>
300 to 900 nm, particularly from 390 to 430 nm, and more particularly from<br>
400 to 410 nm and a novel imide compound<br>
The optical recording medium according to the present invention is one<br>
capable of writing and reading data However, herein, as an appropriate<br>
example, an optical recording medium of the present invention having a<br>
recording layer and a reflecting layer on a substrate will be explained. Note<br>
that, in the following explanation, as an optical recording medium, an optical<br>
disk, which has a supporting substrate having guide grooves and a reflecting<br>
film and a recording layer containing an organic dye as a main component<br>
formed on the guide grooves, to which a laser beam of a wavelength of 300<br>
to 500 nm is applied to perform read and write of a signal, will be described<br>
However the optical recording medium of the present invention is not limited<br>
to such a structure and constitution, and may be applied to the media of a<br>
card-form, sheet-form and other forms, and having no reflecting layer, and<br>
applied to writing and reading performed by a shorter wavelength laser which<br><br>
will be developed in future<br>
An optical recording medium of the present invention has, for example,<br>
either a four layered structure in which a substrate 1, a recording layer 2, a<br>
reflecting layer 3 and a protecting layer 4 are sequentially stacked as shown<br>
in Figure 2 or a bonded structure as shown in Figure 3 More specifically,<br>
the recording layer 2 is formed on the substrate 1 and the reflecting layer 3 is<br>
formed on and in close contact with the recording layer 2 Further on the<br>
resultant structure, the protecting layer 4 is bonded with an adhesion layer 5<br>
interposed between them Note that another layer may be present under or<br>
on the recording layer 2 and another layer may be present on the reflecting<br>
layer 3 Alternatively, as shown in Figure 4, the substrate 1, reflecting layer<br>
3, recording layer 2, and protecting layer 4 are sequentially stacked and read<br>
and write may be performed from the side of the protecting layer As<br>
described in Japanese Patent Laid-Open No 10-326435, a medium may<br>
have a structure in which the thickness of a light transmission layer is defined<br>
based on the numerical aperture (N A ) of the optical system and the<br>
wavelength X of a laser. Furthermore, an optical recording medium of the<br>
present invention may have a structure having two or more recording layers if<br>
necessary as described in Japanese Patent Laid-Open No 11-203729<br>
As an example where the present invention is applied to an optical<br>
disk, a structure as shown in Figure 5 may be mentioned in which a substrate<br>
11, a recoding layer 12, a reflecting layer 13 and a protecting layer 14 are<br>
stacked in this order and further a dummy substrate 15 is bonded on the<br>
protecting layer 14 also serving as an adhesion layer Of course, a structure<br>
having no substrate 15 may be used and other layers may be present<br><br>
between the substrate 11 and the recording layer 12, between the recording<br>
layer 12 and the reflecting layer 13, between the reflecting layer 13 and the<br>
protecting layer 14, and between the protecting layer 14 and the dummy<br>
substrate 15 In the optical disk of Figure 5, write and read may be<br>
performed from the side of the substrate 11<br>
Furthermore, as another embodiment, the constitution disclosed in<br>
Japanese Patent Laid-Open No 10-302310 may be used For example, as<br>
shown in Figure 6, on the supporting substrate 11' having guide grooves<br>
therein, a reflecting layer 13' and a recording layer 12' containing an organic<br>
dye as a main component are stacked in this order On the recording layer<br>
12', a light transmission layer 15' is formed via a transparent protecting layer<br>
14', which is optionally formed on the recording layer 12' Write and read<br>
are performed from the side of the light transmission layer 15' Note that<br>
guide grooves may be conversely formed on the side of the light transmission<br>
layer 15' and the transparent protecting layer 14', recording layer 12' and<br>
reflecting layer 13' may be stacked on the light transmission layer 15' and<br>
adhered to the supporting substrate 11'<br>
Alternatively, as another embodiment, the structure disclosed in<br>
Japanese Patent Laid-Open No 2002-175645 is known For example, as<br>
shown in Figure 7, on a supporting substrate 21 having guide grooves, a<br>
recording layer 22 containing an organic dye as a main component is formed<br>
in this order On the recording layer 22, a nitride layer 23 and an oxide layer<br>
24 are sequentially formed, thereby forming a dielectric layer 40 Further,<br>
on the dielectric layer 40, a light transmission layer 25 is formed by applying<br>
an adhesive agent between them, if necessary. The write and read of data<br><br>
is performed from the side of the light transmission layer 25 Note that, the<br>
structure may be conversely formed by forming guide grooves on the side of<br>
the light transmission layer 25, stacking a dielectric layer 40, which is formed<br>
by sequentially stacking the oxide layer 24 and the nitride layer 23, and the<br>
recording layer 22 and adhering to the supporting substrate 21 As<br>
described above, an optical recording medium providing an appropriate initial<br>
reflectivity can be obtained by obtaining an optical enhancement effect due to<br>
multiple interference given by forming a dielectric layer on a data recording<br>
layer without using a reflecting layer A compound of the present invention<br>
can be applied to such a medium<br>
In the present invention, a recording layer is provided on a substrate<br>
The recording layer of the present invention contains at least one type of<br>
imide-based compound according to the present invention, in particular, a<br>
compound represented by a general formula (1), as a recording dye The<br>
recording dye is the one whose thermal decomposition and sublimation can<br>
be induced by laser beam irradiation, to cause a change of a recording layer<br>
or in the texture (formation of pits), thereby forming a portion varied in<br>
reflectivity An optical recording medium of the present invention is capable<br>
of writing and reading data with the wavelength of a recording laser<br>
particularly selected from the wavelength range of 300 to 900 nm More<br>
particularly, when a writing laser wavelength and reading laser wavelength<br>
selected from the range of 390 to 430 nm, and more particularly, from 400 to<br>
410 nm is applied to the optical recording medium, good signal<br>
characteristics can be obtained<br>
An imide compound according to the present invention, since it can<br><br>
arbitrarily select the absorbing wavelength by selecting a substituent while<br>
maintaining the absorption constant, can provide a satisfactory optical<br>
constant required for the recording layer at the aforementioned laser<br>
wavelength Furthermore, the imide compound is extremely useful organic<br>
dye having a high stability to light and excellent stability of reading light<br>
The present invention will be described in more detail below<br>

types of imide compounds according to the present invention are contained<br>
in the recoding layer As an imide compound according to the present<br>

When a recording layer is formed on a substrate, other layers formed<br>
of an inorganic substance and a polymer, respectively, may be provided on<br>
the substrate in order to improve solvent-resistance, reflectivity, and<br>
recording sensitivity<br>
Although the content of an imide compound according to the present<br>
invention in the recording layer may be arbitrarily set as long as it attains<br>
write and read, usually the content is 30% or more and preferably 60% or<br>
more. Incidentally, it is also preferable that the content be substantially<br>
100%.<br>
Examples of providing a recording layer include coating methods such<br>
as a spin coating, spraying, casting, slide coating, curtain coating, extrusion,<br>
wire coating, gravure coating, spreading, roller coating, knife coating, and<br>
soaking, sputtering method, chemical vapor deposition method, and vacuum<br>
vapor deposition method, however, a spin coating method is simple and thus<br>

When a coating method such as a spin coating method is used, a<br><br>
coating solution in which an imide compound according to the present<br>
invention is dissolved or dispersed in a solvent in an amount of 1 to 40% by<br>
weight, preferably 3 to 30% by weight, is used In this case, it is preferable<br>

a sputter method, chemical vapor deposition method or vacuum vapor<br>
deposition method may be effective<br>
The film thickness of a recording layer is 10 to 1,000 nm and<br>
preferably 20 to 300 nm. When the film thickness of the recording layer is<br>
set thinner than 10 nm, thermal diffusion may become large As a result,<br>
write may not be performed or distortion of a recording signal may occur In<br><br>
addition, signal amplitude sometimes decreases On the other hand, when<br>
the film thickness is thicker than 1,000 nm, the reflectivity decreases and<br>
regeneration signal characteristics sometimes decrease<br>
Subsequently, on the recording layer, a reflecting layer preferably<br>
having a thickness of 50 to 300 nm is formed To increase the reflectivity<br>
and adhesiveness, a reflection-amplification layer and adhesive layer may be<br>
provided between the recording layer and the reflecting layer As a material<br>
for the reflecting layer, metals exhibiting a high reflectivity at a wavelength of<br>
regeneration light such as Au, Al, Ag, Cu, Ti, Cr, Ni, Pt, Ta and Pd can be<br>
used singly or in the form of an alloy Of them, Au, Ag and Al are preferable<br>
as a material for the reflecting layer since they have high reflectivities<br>
When write and read is performed by a blue laser, Al or Ag is preferable<br>
Other than this, the following elements may be contained For example,<br>
metals or semi metals such as Mg, Se, Hf, V, Nb, Ru, W, Mn, Re, Fe, Co,<br>
Rh, Ir, Zn, Cd, Ga, In, Si, Ge, Te, Pb, Po, Sn, and Bi may be mentioned. A<br>
material containing Ag or Al as a main component is preferable since a<br>
reflecting layer exhibiting a high reflectivity can be easily obtained<br>
Alternatively, a low-reflectivity thin film and a high-reflectively thin film are<br>
formed of non-metal materials and they are alternately layered to form a<br>
multi-layered form, which may be used as a reflecting layer<br>
Examples of a method for forming a reflecting layer include methods of<br>
sputtering, ion-plating, chemical vapor deposition, and vacuum vapor<br>
deposition Further on a substrate or under a reflecting layer, an<br>
intermediate layer and an adhesive layer of known inorganic or organic<br>

resin is dissolved in an appropriate solvent to prepare a coating solution and<br>
thereafter the coating solution is applied and dried to form a protecting layer<br>
An ultraviolet-ray curing resin may be directly coated or after it is dissolved in<br>
an appropriate solvent to prepare a coating solution, and the coating solution<br>
is coated and then ultraviolet-ray is applied to cure, thereby forming a<br>
protecting layer. As an ultraviolet-ray curing resin, acrylate resins such as<br>
urethane acrylate, epoxy acrylate, and polyester acrylate may be used<br>
These materials may be used singly or in a mixture and may be formed into a<br>
single layer or a multi-layer film<br>
As a method of forming a protecting layer, the same methods as<br>
employed in forming a recording layer, that is, a coating method such as a<br>
spin coating and casting, sputtering method, and a chemical vapor deposition<br>
method may be used. Of them, a spin coating method is preferable<br>
The film thickness of a protecting layer generally falls within the range<br>
of 0 1 μm to 100 μm, however, in the present invention, it falls within the<br>
range of 3 to 30 μm, and more preferably 5 to 20 μm<br>
Further on the protecting layer, a label, bar cord or the like may be<br>
printed.<br><br>
Furthermore, on the reflecting layer surface, a protecting sheet or a<br>
substrate may be adhered or two optical recording media may be adhered by<br>
making reflecting layer surfaces to face inward each other<br>

reflecting layer As a material for the reflecting layer, metals exhibiting a<br>
high reflectivity at a wavelength of regeneration light, metals such as Al, Ag,<br>
Ni and Pt may be used singly or in the form of an alloy Of them, Ag and Al<br>
are preferable as a material for the reflecting layer since they have high<br>
reflectivities Besides this, the following elements may be contained, if<br>
necessary For example, metals or semi metals such as Mg, Se, Hf, V, Nb,<br>
Ru, W, Mn, Re, Fe, Co, Rh, Ir, Zn, Cd, Ga, In, Si, Ge, Te, Pb, Po, Sn, Bi, Au,<br>
Cu, Ti, Cr, Pd, and Ta may be mentioned. A metal material containing Ag or<br>
Al as a main component and readily providing a reflecting layer exhibiting a<br>
high reflectivity is preferable It is also possible that a multi-layer film is<br>
formed by alternately stacking a low-reflectivity thin film and a high-<br>
reflectively thin film formed of non-metal materials and used as a reflecting<br>
layer<br>

When a coating method such as a spin coating method is used, a<br>
coating solution in which an imide compound according to the present<br>
invention is dissolved or dispersed in a solvent in an amount of 1 to 40% by<br>
weight, preferably 3 to 30% by weight, is used. In this case, it is preferable<br>
to choose as a solvent that will not damage a reflecting layer Examples of<br>
a solvent for use in coating include alcohol solvents such as methanol,<br><br>
ethanol, isopropyl alcohol, octafluoro pentanol, allyl alcohol, methyl<br>

be used singly or in combination<br>
Incidentally, if necessary, a compound for a recording layer may be<br>
used by dispersing it in a polymer thin film<br>
In the case where a solvent not damaging a reflecting layer is not<br>
selected, sputtering method, chemical vapor deposition method or vacuum<br>
vapor deposition method may be effective<br>
The film thickness of a recording layer is 1 to 1,000 nm and preferably<br>
5 to 300 nm When the film thickness of a recording layer is set thinner than<br>
1 nm, write may not be performed or distortion of a recording signal may<br>
occur In addition, signal amplitude sometimes decreases. On the other<br>
hand, when the film thickness is thicker than 1,000 nm, the reflectivity<br>
decreases and regeneration signal characteristics sometimes decrease<br>

curing resin may be directly coated or after it is dissolved in an appropriate<br>
solvent to prepare a coating solution, and the coating solution is coated and<br>
then ultraviolet-ray is applied to cure, thereby forming a protecting layer As<br>
an ultraviolet-ray resin, acrylate resins such as urethane acrylate, epoxy<br>

outer diameter of 120 mmΦ and a thickness of 0 6 mm with a continuous<br>
guide groove (track pitch 0 74 μm) formed therein, a compound represented<br>
by reference number B-69 was deposited by vacuum vapor deposition<br>
method up to a thickness of 70 nm, thereby forming a recording layer<br>

coated and thereafter, irradiated with ultraviolet rays to obtain a protecting<br>
layer of 5 μm thick Further on the protecting layer, an ultraviolet ray curing<br>
resin "DeSolite KZ-8681" (manufactured by JSR Corporation) was spin<br>
coated and thereafter a polycarbonate resin substrate which was the same<br>
as the substrate mentioned above and had no guide groove was mounted<br>
