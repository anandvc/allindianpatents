				<th>Abstract</th>
				<td>A novel method for increasing the supply ranges of packet oriented transferring radio stations which are located outside the range of a central base station and are supplied by wireless base stations (relay stations). In contrast to conventional wireless transfer systems, a communication service quality is guaranteed. The invention uses a common time-interconnected capacity assignment method. Said capacity assignment is generated by an AP for stations (MT, FMT) which can be reached directly by a base station (AP). Individual MTs are present in the form of wireless base stations and serve as relay stations (FMTs) with regard to the MTs outside the range of an AP. For an AP, FMTs appear as MTs. The FMT forms a partial frame structure in a part of the AP distribution capacity transfer system which is embedded in the time frame structure dictated by the commanding central station.</td>

The present invention relates to mucoadhesive and a process for the preparation of the same. The said granules are<br>
granules of carbomer and in particular to such granules containing pharmaceutical active agents suitable for sustained release into the gastrointestinal tract or for targeted delivery to the gastrointestinal mucosa.<br>
The problems associated with conventional oral administration of drugs are well known.  For example following oral administration of a drug, peak blood level concentrations are attained which then decline until there is a repeat administration*  To maintain the mean blood level concentrations at a therapeutic level either frequent dosing or less frequent dosing but at a higher level is generally required.  The former can result in poor patient compliance while with the latter there may be an unacceptable level of side effects, which depend upon the drug being used.<br>
Therefore various attempts have been made to produce sustained release dosage forms for orally administered drugs.  There have been a number of different approaches. One of the most commonly used is the application of polymers to coat particles of drug substance.  Commonly used coating polymers include those which are insoluble or slowly soluble but are permeable, so allowing gradual release of dissolved drug from the particles as they pass through the gastrointestinal tract.  The disadvantages of this system include the possibility of sudden drug release when the coat is breached and dependence upon gastrointestinal transit time (which varies greatly between individuals)<br>
A further method of improved drug delivery that has been suggested is to combine the active agent with a mucoadhesive agent. Various mucoadhesive agents are<br><br>
known which are believed to bind to the mucus layers coating the stomach and other regions of the gastrointestinal tract.  It is believed that using such agents in combination with an active agent will result in the active agent also being bound to the mucus layer, leading either to slow release into the gastrointestinal tract or direct delivery to the gastrointestinal mucosa.<br>
Carbomers and their salts are particularly useful agents for such drug delivery as they have good mucoadhesive activity.  Furthermore carbomers are themselves known to produce beneficial effects in the gastrointestinal tract and on the gastrointestinal mucus-<br>
One disadvantage of mucoadhesive powders is the possibility that they may form large aggregates on arrival in the stomach, leading to poor release of the active agents or to uneven application to the mucus layers.  Thus granular forms of mucoadhesives are considered to be preferential.  It would also be preferable if the active agent could be mixed as closely as possible with the granular mucoadhesive ie, if they were mixed in the same granules.  A simple method for preparing such granules requiring as few process steps as possible and as few expensive excipients (for example complex binding agents) would therefore be very valuable.<br>
In a first aspect of the invention there are therefore provided mucoadhesive granules comprising<br>
a)	carbomer and/or a salt thereof (hereinafter component a); and<br>
b)	an inert filler (hereinafter component b)•<br>
Carbomers are synthetic high molecular weight polymers of acrylic acid cross linked with either alkyl<br><br>
esters of sucrose or pentaerythritol.  Suitable commercially available grades of carbomer include Carbopol 910, Carbopol 934P, Carbopol 940, Carbopol 941, Carbopol 971P, Carbopol 974P, Carbopol 980, Carbopol 981, Carbopol 1342, Rheogic 252L and Rheogic 250H (both available from Nikon Junyaku)and Hostacerin PN73 (available from Hoechst UK).<br>
Salts of carbomer may be complete salts (where all of the acid groups have been neutralised) or partial salts (in which only a proportion of the acid groups have been neutralised).  Where salts of carbomer are referred to it will be understood that this includes complete salts, partial salts or mixtures thereof.<br>
Preferred salts of carbomer are mono or divalent salts, most preferably sodium or potassium salts.<br>
Suitable inert fillers include carbohydrates (for example dextrose, sucrose, mannitol, lactose, starch or microcrystalline cellulose) or inorganic salts (for example dicalcium phosphate, tricalcium phosphate or magnesium carbonate)<br>
Preferably the inert filler is microcrystalline cellulose-<br>
The mucoadhesive granules of the invention preferably comprise from 5 to 50% w/w carbomer and/or a salt thereof, more preferably 10 to 45% w/w and most preferably 15 to 40% w/w.<br>
The mucoadhesive granules of the invention preferably comprise from 5 to 94% w/w inert filler, more preferably 15 to 75% w/w.<br>
The mucoadhesive granules of the invention may also<br><br>
comprise an active agent suitable for sustained release into the gastrointestinal tract or for targeted delivery to the gastrointestinal mucosa.<br>
There are therefore further provided mucoadhesive granules comprising<br>
a)	carbomer and/or a salt thereof;<br>
b)	an inert filler;  and<br>
c)	a pharmaceutically active agent (hereinafter component c) suitable for sustained release into the gastrointestinal tract or for targeted delivery to the gastrointestinal mucosa,<br>
Pharmaceutically active agents suitable for sustained release into the gastrointestinal tract (component cl) are well known and include antimicrobial agents, analgesics, local anaesthetics, cardiovascular drugs, antacids, antiinflammatories, antitussives, H2-receptor antagonists and antidepressants.  Preferably component cl) is either a compound having poor solubility in the gastrointestinal lumen, or it is combined with release retarding components to delay its release from the mucoadhesive granules of the invention.<br>
Pharmaceutically active agents suitable for targeted delivery to the gastrointestinal mucosa (component c2) include antimicrobial agents (for example antibiotics or antiseptic agents), proton pump inhibitors (for example omeprazole), prokinetic/gastric emptying agents (e.g. cisapride), H2-receptor antagonists, local anaesthetics, antacids or ulcer healing agents.  Preferably component c2) has poor solubility in the gastrointestinal lumen.<br>
It is preferred that the solubility of component c2) is greater in neutral or basic conditions than in acid<br><br>
conditions.  An example of a compound having the preferred properties of component c2) is triclosan*<br>
It will be appreciated that many compounds may be equally suitable for use as component cl) or component<br>
c2) .<br>
Preferably component c) is an antimicrobial agent, more preferably triclosan or a derivative thereof*<br>
The term "triclosan or a derivative thereof" as used herein is intended to encompass the use of an amount of an ester of triclosan or a derivative thereof, a cationic salt or an ester of triclosan or a derivative thereof which will provide the equivalent amount of triclosan or the said derivative thereof.<br>
Examples of esters of triclosan or esters of the derivatives thereof for use in the present invention are the phosphate, phosphonate, sulfate, glucuronide, succinate and glutamate esters.  Particularly preferred esters are the phosphate esters of triclosan.<br>
The phosphate esters may be prepared by the phosphorylation of triclosan or a derivative thereof, using methods well known in the art*<br>
The esters may be present in the form of the cationic salts thereof, for example the sodium, potassium, calcium or magnesium salts.<br>
The cationic salts of triclosan may also be used in the present invention, for example, the sodium or potassium salts-<br>
Derivatives of triclosan which may be used in the present invention further include those compounds in<br><br>
which one or both of the phenyl groups is/are substituted by one or more substituent groups in addition to the chloro substituents already present on the phenyl rings. Examples of suitable substituents are alkyl groups containing 1 to 4 carbon atoms, haloalkyl groups containing 1 to 4 carbon atoms, alkoxy groups containing 1 to 4 carbon atoms, cyano, allyl, amino and acetyl groups.  Preferred substituents are methyl, methoxy and trifluoromethyl groups.  It will be understood that if triclosan is substituted by more than one substituent, then the substituents may be the same or different.<br>
Most preferably component c) is triclosan.<br>
When present in the mucoadhesive granules of the invention component c) preferably comprises 0.01 to 70% by weight of the total granular weight/ more preferably 0.1 to 50% and most preferably 1 to 35%.<br>
The mucoadhesive granules of the invention may optionally further comprise one or more .disintegrants, for example sodium starch glycolate, croscarmellose sodium or crospovidone.  Where used the disintegrants preferably comprise no more than 30% w/w of the mucoadhesive granules of the invention.<br>
Where component c) is triclosan or a derivative thereof it is preferred that the mucoadhesive granules of the invention further comprise a solvent and/or an aqueous solubility enhancing agent for the triclosan or derivative thereof.<br>
There are therefore yet further provided mucoadhesive granules comprising:-<br>
a)	carbomer and/or a salt thereof;<br>
b)	an inert filler;<br><br>
c)	triclosan or a derivative thereof; and<br>
d)	a solvent and/or an aqueous solubility enhancing agent for the triclosan (hereinafter component d)♦<br>
Component d) is selected from those agents in which triclosan or its derivatives are soluble and/or those agents which improve the aqueous solubility of triclosan or its derivatives.<br>
Component d) is preferably selected from alcohols, polyalcohols, surfactants or mixtures thereof.  More preferably component d) is selected from polyethylene glycols,   propylene glycol, anionic surfactants or mixtures thereof. Most preferably component c) is propylene glycol, sodium lauryl sulphate or mixtures thereof.<br>
Where component d) is an alcohol or a polyalcohol it preferably comprises from l to 20% by weight of the total weight of the mucoadhesive granules of the invention, more preferably from 2 to 15%.<br>
Where compound d) is a surfactant it preferably comprises from 0.1 to 5% by weight of the mucoadhesive granules of the invention, more preferably from 0.2 to 3%.<br>
The mucoadhesive granules of the invention in which component c) is triclosan or a derivative thereof are particularly suitable for the preparation of a medicament for the treatment of gastrointestinal disorders associated with Helicobacter pylori infections.<br>
The mucoadhesive granules of the invention are particularly easy and economical to manufacture because<br><br>
the carbomer and/or carbomer salts will act as a binding agent so removing the need for extra excipients.<br>
Therefore it is preferred that no binding agents (other than carbomers and/or salt thereof) are used in the granulation stage of the preparation of the mucoadhesive granules of the invention.  Most particularly it is preferred that no water insoluble anionic polymers are used as binding agents in the granulation stage of the manufacture of the mucoadhesive granules of the invention.<br>
The mucoadhesive granules of the invention may therefore simply be manufactured by blending components a) and b) , and granulating with a granulation fluid.  The granules so formed may be used in the wet state or they may be dried by any conventional means.<br>
If component c) is to be incorporated into the mucoadhesive granules of the invention it may be added either with components a) and b) or dissolved in the granulation fluid.<br>
There is therefore provided a process for the preparation of the mucoadhesive granules of the invention by<br>
i) mixing a carbomer and/or a salt thereof (component a) with component b) plus, optionally, component c);<br>
ii)  applying to the mixture i) a granulating fluid (optionally comprising component c) whilst blending; and, optionally,<br>
iii) drying the prepared granules.<br><br>
The granulation fluid may be any suitable fluid which is compatible with the components of the granules. The granulation fluid should be one which is relatively easily removable from the granules during drying, or which is safe for human consumption if the granules are not to be dried.  Preferably the granulation fluid is an alcohol (e.g. ethanol or isopropanol), a polyalcohol (e.g. glycerol or polyethylene glycol 300), water or a mixture thereof.  Most preferably the granulation fluid is water.<br>
The amount of granulation fluid necessary will depend upon the nature of the components used, the nature of the granulation fluid and the scale of manufacture* The amount necessary may be determined by simple observation of the wet granules.<br>
Granulation times plus drying times and temperatures will also depend upon the nature of the components, and the scale of manufacture. They may be determined by simple experimentation.<br>
A further advantage of the invention is that where component a) is a salt of a carbomer, or a mixture of a carbomer and a salt thereof the salts may be prepared in situ as part of the process. This may be achieved by use of a base or a basic salt which will react with the carbomer to form a salt thereof.  The base or basic salt may be added either in step i) or step ii) .<br>
There is therefore provided a process for the preparation of the mucoadhesive granules of the invention wherein component a) is a carbomer salt, or a mixture of carbomer and a salt thereof, by<br>
i) mixing a carbomer with component b) plus, optionally, component c);<br><br>

ii)  applying to the mixture i) a granulation fluid (optionally comprising component c) whilst blending; and, optionally,<br>
iii) drying the prepared granules.<br>
There is yet further provided a process for the preparation of the mucoadhesive granules of the invention wherein component a) is a carbomer salt or a mixture of carbomer and a salt thereof, by<br>
i)  mixing a carbomer with component b) plus, optionally, component c);<br>
ii)  applying to the mixture i) a granulation fluid further comprising a base or a basic salt and, optionally,  component c) whilst blending; and, optionally,<br><br>
iii) drying the prepared granules.<br>
Preferred bases for use in the invention include sodium hydroxide and potassium hydroxide.  Preferred basic salts include sodium bicarbonate, sodium carbonate, calcium carbonate, potassium carbonate and potassium bicarbonate.<br>
Where component c) is included in step 1) of the preparation of the mucoadhesive granules of the invention it may be included either<br>
i)   by dry mixing with components a) and b), or<br>
ii)  where component c) is not readily soluble in the granulation fluid, by dissolving component c) in a suitable solvent, mixing the solvent with components a) and b);  and optionally removing the solvent by pre drying before application of the granulation fluid, 'or during the drying of the granules.<br>
If component d) is to be incorporated into the mucoadhesive granules of the invention, it may be added either with component a) and b) or mixed with the granulation fluid.<br>
Any other optional ingredients in the mucoadhesive granules of the invention may be added either with components a) and b) or mixed with the granulation fluid depending upon their compatabilities and form etc.  The method of addition will be based on conventional granulation procedures.<br>
Further according to the invention there is provided a pharmaceutical composition (hereinafter the pharmaceutical composition) comprising mucoadhesive granules of the invention.<br><br>

The Carbopol and microcrystalline cellulose were blended in a high shear mixer granulator.<br>
Approximately- 350ml of water was sprayed onto the powders until granulation was complete.<br>
The granules were dried in a fluid bed drier at 60°c for 45 minutes.<br>
The granules were milled to a size of less than 500 urn.<br>
The granules were blended with 666g calcium carbonate and 20g magnesium stearate and then pressed into 600mg tablets.<br><br>
Example 12<br>
Mucoadhesive granules comprising carbomer and triclosan were prepared according to the following process *<br>
g/batch<br>
Triclosan	1428.6<br>
Carbopol 934P	1428.6<br>
Microcrystalline cellulose    785.7<br>
Propylene glycol	357.1<br>
Granulating fluid - water<br>
The triclosan, Carbopol and microcrystalline cellulose were blended in a high shear mixer granulator. The propylene glycol was added and blended in.<br>
Approximately 400ml of water was sprayed onto the mixture until granulation was complete.<br>
The wet granules were screened through a 1 mm sieve and dried in a fluid bed drier at 40°C for 60 minutes.<br>
The dried granules were milled to a size of less than 500 urn.<br>
Example 13<br>
Tablets containing mucoadhesive granules comprising carbomer and triclosan were prepared according to the following process.<br>
2840g of the granules of Example 12 were blended with 1014.3g calcium carbonate, 277.9g microcrystalline cellulose, 63.9g sodium starch glycolate, 42.6g silicon dioxide and 21.3g magnesium stearate.<br><br>
The resulting mixture was compressed into 420mg tablets.<br>
Example 14<br>
The mucoadhesive and drug delivery properties of the granules of the invention were demonstrated by the following process*<br>
A stomach of a freshly slaughtered pig was opened at the fundus region, the contents washed out and the opening sutured.<br>
The stomach was equilibrated with 50ml of simulated gastric medium at 37°C.<br>
A tablet as prepared in Example 5 was introduced through the oesophagus and left to disperse for 30 minutes.<br>
The stomach was then emptied through the pylorus, and a water wash introduced through the oesophagus and removed, also through the pylorus.<br>
Examination of the stomach walls after cutting open revealed granules of the tablet dispersed widely over the stomach mucus.  The mucus layer was also found to be considerably more viscous than that from a stomach tested with a tablet prepared as in Example 5 but omitting any carbomer.<br>
Analysis of the mucus scraped off the stomach wall showed that more than 50% of the triclosan from the tablet as prepared in Example 5 was present in the mucus with the remainder being found in the simulated gastric medium and the water wash.<br><br><br><br>
