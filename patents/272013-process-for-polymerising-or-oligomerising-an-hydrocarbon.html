				<td>THIS INVENTION relates to a process for polymerising or<br>
oligomerising a hydrocarbon.<br>
According to the invention, there is provided a process for<br>
polymerising or oligomerising a hydrocarbon, the process including<br>
feeding a liquid hydrocarbon reactant and a liquid evaporative cooling<br>
medium into a bulk liquid phase which includes polymeric or oligomeric product<br>
admixed with a catalyst;<br>
allowing at least a portion of the liquid hydrocarbon reactant and the liquid<br>
evaporative cooling medium to vapourise to form bubbles rising through the bulk<br>
liquid phase, with the hydrocarbon reactant polymerising or oligomerising to form<br>
the polymeric or oligomeric product and with the evaporation of both the liquid<br>
hydrocarbon reactant and the liquid evaporative cooling medium effecting heat<br>
removal from the bulk liquid phase;<br>
allowing gaseous components comprising any unreacted vapourised<br>
hydrocarbon reactant and vapourised cooling medium and any gaseous product<br>
that may have formed to disengage from the bulk liquid phase into a head space<br>
above the bulk liquid phase;<br>
withdrawing the gaseous components from the head space;<br>
cooling the gaseous components withdrawn from the head space, forming<br>
condensed hydrocarbon reactant and condensed cooling medium and gaseous<br>
product;<br>
separating the condensed hydrocarbon reactant and condensed cooling<br>
medium from the gaseous product and withdrawing the gaseous product;<br>
recycling the condensed hydrocarbon reactant and the condensed cooling<br>
medium to the bulk liquid phase; and<br>
withdrawing liquid phase to maintain the bulk liquid phase at a desired<br>
level.<br>
The bulk liquid phase may be contained in a bubbling column<br>
reactor, with the rising bubbles creating turbulence in the bulk liquid phase,<br>
thereby also mixing the bulk liquid phase. When the bulk liquid phase is contained<br>
in a bubbling column reactor, the liquid or condensed hydrocarbon reactant and<br>
the condensed cooling medium are typically fed at or near a bottom of the<br>
bubbling column reactor.<br>
Instead, the bulk liquid phase may be contained in a continuously<br>
stirred tank reactor.<br>
The bulk liquid phase may include an inert solvent, e.g. to act as a<br>
diluent thereby limiting incorporation of desirable oligomeric product in lower value<br>
heavier by-products. Any inert solvent that does not react with components of the<br>
bulk liquid phase, and which does not crack in the temperature range 25 to 300 Â°C<br>
can be used. These inert solvents may include saturated aliphatics, unsaturated<br>
aliphatics, aromatic hydrocarbons and halogenated hydrocarbons. Typical<br>
solvents include, but are not limited to, benzene, toluene, xylene, cumene,<br>
heptane, methylcyclohexane, methylcyclopentane, cyclohexane, Isopar C, Isopar<br>
E, 2,2,4-trimethylpentane, Norpar, chlorobenzene, 1,2-dichlorobenzene, ionic<br>
liquids and the like.<br>
The gaseous product typically includes uncondensed unreacted<br>
hydrocarbon reactant and possibly uncondensed cooling medium. The process<br>
may include treating the gaseous product to recover uncondensed unreacted<br>
hydrocarbon reactant and/or uncondensed cooling medium from the gaseous<br>
product. This treatment may include at least one distillation stage, recovering the<br>
hydrocarbon reactant and/or the cooling medium for recycle to the bulk liquid<br>
phase.<br>
The process may include treating the withdrawn liquid phase to<br>
separate polymeric or oligomeric product from solvent. The treatment of the liquid<br>
phase may include subjecting the liquid phase to at least one distillation stage to<br>
obtain a solvent stream. The solvent stream may be recycled to the bulk liquid<br>
phase.<br>
The polymerisation or oligomerisation reaction or reactions in the<br>
bulk liquid phase are exothermic, requiring cooling of the bulk liquid phase. In the<br>
process of the invention, this heat removal is at least predominantly effected by<br>
means of the latent heat required for evaporation of the liquid evaporative cooling<br>
medium and the liquid hydrocarbon reactant. Sufficient liquid evaporative cooling<br>
medium and liquid hydrocarbon reactant may be fed and recycled to the bulk<br>
liquid phase to balance any reaction exotherm, thereby approaching isothermal<br>
behaviour, i.e. maintaining a steady temperature in the bulk liquid phase. This<br>
feature of the invention is important, as the absence of a heat exchanger in direct<br>
contact with the bulk liquid phase reduces the surface area that may be<br>
susceptible to fouling, which is often a problem with polymerisation or<br>
oligomerisation processes. Furthermore, in one embodiment of the invention, the<br>
vigorous mixing caused by the vapourisation of liquid droplets of the hydrocarbon<br>
reactant and the evaporative cooling medium as they enter the bulk liquid phase<br>
to form rising gas bubbles (e.g. in the case of a bubbling column) obviates the<br>
need for a stirrer or agitator, which may also be susceptible to fouling.<br>
The liquid hydrocarbon reactant may be an olefinic feedstock, i.e.<br>
comprising one or more olefinic monomers. Preferably, the olefinic feedstock<br>
comprises predominantly a-olefins, e.g. ethylene.<br>
The process may thus be an oligomerisation process. In one<br>
embodiment of the invention, the process is predominantly a trimerisation<br>
process. In another embodiment of the invention, the process is predominantly a<br>
tetramerisation process.<br>
In a further embodiment, the process is predominantly both a<br>
trimerisation process and a tetramerisation process.<br>
The liquid hydrocarbon reactant may thus be liquid ethylene. The<br>
liquid hydrocarbon reactant being fed to the bulk liquid phase is preferably sub-<br>
cooled. The degree of sub-cooling is preferably sufficient to prevent premature<br>
flashing of the liquid hydrocarbon in a feed line and/or nozzle used to feed the<br>
liquid hydrocarbon to the bulk liquid phase.<br>
When the liquid hydrocarbon reactant is liquid ethylene, the bulk<br>
liquid phase may be at an operating pressure of at least about 1 bar(a), more<br>
preferably at least about 10 bar(a), most preferably at least about 30 bar(a), e.g.<br>
between about 45 bar(a) and about 50 bar(a). The temperature of the bulk liquid<br>
phase may be from about 30 to about 100Â°C, preferably from about 40 to about<br>
80Â°C, e.g. between about 50 and about 70Â°C.<br>
The evaporative cooling medium is typically a hydrocarbon which<br>
acts as an inert in the oligomerising or polymerising reactions, and which acts to<br>
increase the bubble point temperature of an admixture or condensate obtained by<br>
condensing the vapourised hydrocarbon reactant and the vapourised evaporative<br>
cooling medium withdrawn from the head space above the bulk liquid phase,<br>
disregarding other lighter components which may be present in the gaseous<br>
components withdrawn from the head space above the bulk liquid phase.<br>
Preferably, the evaporative cooling medium, and the concentration of the<br>
evaporative cooling medium in the bulk liquid phase of the bubbling column, are<br>
selected such that the bubble point temperature of the gaseous components<br>
withdrawn from the head space above the bulk liquid phase, at the pressure at<br>
which the gaseous components are cooled for condensation purposes, is<br>
preferably at least 30Â°C, and more preferably at least 40Â°C. This bubble point<br>
temperature should however be lower than the temperature of the bulk liquid<br>
phase, providing for an adequate temperature driving force to enable<br>
vapourisation of at least a portion of the liquid hydrocarbon reactant and the liquid<br>
cooling medium fed into the bulk liquid phase. Advantageously, with a bubble<br>
point temperature in the order of, say 30 to 55Â°C, it is possible to cool the gaseous<br>
components withdrawn from the head space above the bulk liquid phase with<br>
plant cooling water, obviating the need for refrigerated water as a cooling utility for<br>
purposes of cooling and condensing a major portion of the gaseous components<br>
withdrawn from the head space above the bulk liquid phase. As will be<br>
appreciated, this provides a significant economic benefit to the process of the<br>
invention.<br>
The evaporative cooling medium may be any inert component or<br>
mixture of components that does not react with components of the bulk liquid<br>
phase, preferably having a normal boiling point within the range of - 20 to - 60Â°C,<br>
and may include, but is not limited to, propane, cyclopropane,<br>
chlorodifluoromethane, difluoromethane, 1,1,1-trifluoroethane, pentafluoroethane,<br>
octafluoropropane, 1,1,1,2-tetraf luoroethane, trifluorobromomethane,<br>
chlorotrifluoroethylene, chloropentafluoroethane, ethyl-fluoride, 1,1,1-<br>
trifluoroethane, chloropentafluoroethane, and mixtures of two or more of these.<br>
The solvent and the evaporative cooling medium may in some<br>
embodiments of the invention be the same. In other words, the evaporative<br>
cooling medium may also act as an inert solvent or diluent to limit incorporation of<br>
desirable polymeric or oligomeric product in lower value or heavier by-products,<br>
with no other solvent being added to the bulk liquid phase.<br>
The bulk liquid phase may form part of a first oligomerisation stage.<br>
The process may include feeding the withdrawn liquid phase from the first<br>
oligomerisation stage to a second oligomerisation stage comprising bulk liquid<br>
phase, and feeding said liquid hydrocarbon reactant also into the bulk liquid phase<br>
of the second oligomerisation stage, to form further polymeric or oligomeric<br>
product. In other words, the process may use at least two oligomerisation stages<br>
in series for the bulk liquid phase, with fresh liquid hydrocarbon reactant being fed<br>
into the bulk liquid phase of each oligomerisation stage (i.e. the oligomerisation<br>
stages are in parallel for the liquid hydrocarbon reactant), and preferably with the<br>
withdrawn gaseous components from the head spaces above the bulk liquid<br>
phase of each oligomerisation stage being combined and with the condensed<br>
hydrocarbon reactant and the condensed cooling medium being recycled, e.g. in<br>
parallel, to the bulk liquid phase of both of the oligomerisation stages.<br>
The process may include treating the withdrawn liquid phase to<br>
separate unreacted hydrocarbon reactant and/or cooling medium from the<br>
polymeric or oligomeric product. This treatment may include subjecting the liquid<br>
phase to at least one distillation stage and withdrawing the unreacted hydrocarbon<br>
reactant and/or cooling medium as an overhead stream from the distillation stage.<br>
The withdrawn unreacted hydrocarbon reactant and/or cooling medium may be<br>
recycled to the bulk liquid phase. It will be appreciated that for embodiments of the<br>
invention where the solvent and the evaporative cooling medium are the same, a<br>
single treatment stage may be employed to separate unreacted hydrocarbon<br>
reactant and/or cooling medium/solvent from polymeric or oligomeric product. The<br>
separated unreacted hydrocarbon reactant and the separated cooling<br>
medium/solvent may be returned as a single stream to the bulk liquid phase. In<br>
such an embodiment of the invention, the need for an additional treatment stage<br>
for recovery of a solvent different to the evaporative cooling medium is thus<br>
obviated.<br>
The use of a highly polar evaporative cooling medium is preferential<br>
to the use of a less or non-polar evaporative cooling medium, so as to provide<br>
adequate solubility of the catalyst in the portion of the evaporative cooling medium<br>
forming part of and acting as diluent in the bulk liquid phase, thereby possibly<br>
obviating the need for an additional inert solvent as hereinbefore described.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, the evaporative cooling medium<br>
is propane. In another embodiment of the invention, the evaporative cooling<br>
medium is chlorodifluoromethane. Preferably, the mass fraction of propane in<br>
ethylene is between about 0.3 and about 0.7, most preferably between about 0.4<br>
and about 0.6.<br>
The trimerisation of ethylene to 1-hexene is a significant commercial<br>
operation. In addition to its use as a specific chemical, 1-hexene is extensively<br>
used in polymerisation processes either as a monomer or co-monomer. The<br>
trimeric products derived from longer chain olefins can be used as synthetic<br>
lubricants (e.g. as polyalphaolefins) and in applications such as components of<br>
drilling muds and as a feedstock to prepare detergents and plasticizers.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, the catalyst is a dissolved<br>
transition metal compound catalyst, e.g. a chromium catalyst, with a heteroatomic<br>
or homoatomic, ligand, typically used with an activator. A number of dissolved<br>
transition metal compound catalysts have been developed for use to trimerise or<br>
tetramerise olefins, e.g. as disclosed in US 4,668,838; EP 0668105; US<br>
5,750,817; US 6,031,145; US 5,811,618; WO 03/053890; WO 2004/056478; WO<br>
2004/056477; WO 2004/056479; WO 2004/056480; WO 2005/123633 and WO<br>
2007/007272, all of which are incorporated herein by reference. The catalyst may<br>
instead be a nickel catalyst comprising a chelating ligand, e.g. 2-diphenyl<br>
phosphine benzoic acid, typically used with a catalyst activator such as sodium<br>
tetraphenylborate. Also possible is the use of trialkylaluminium catalysts.<br>
Some of these catalysts are selective for C6 and Ce oligomeric<br>
products, e.g. 1-hexene and 1-octene, and the Applicant believes that such<br>
catalysts will be particularly advantageous for use with the process of the<br>
invention as the selective production of 1-hexene and 1-octene is commercially<br>
important.<br>
Suitable activators include organoaluminium compounds, boron<br>
compounds, organic salts, such as methyl lithium and methyl magnesium<br>
bromide, inorganic acids and salts, such as tetrafluoroboric acid etherate, silver<br>
tetrafluoroborate, sodium hexafluoroantimonate, aluminate activators e.g. trityl<br>
perfluoro-tributyl aluminate, and the like.<br>
Organoaluminium compounds which act as suitable activators<br>
include alkylaluminium compounds such as trialkylaluminium and aluminoxanes.<br>
Aluminoxane activators are well known in the art and can be<br>
prepared by the controlled addition of water to an alkylaluminium compound, such<br>
as trimethylaluminium. In such process the alkylaluminium compounds are only<br>
partially hydrolysed to prevent or at least to reduce the formation of aluminium<br>
hydroxide during the preparation of aluminoxanes. Commercially available<br>
aluminoxanes consequently include unreacted alkylaluminium. The result is that<br>
commercially available aluminoxanes are usually mixtures of an aluminoxane and<br>
an alkylaluminium.<br>
In this specification the term "aluminoxanes" is used to denote a<br>
compound represented by the general formulae (Ra-AI-0)n and Rb(Rc-AI-0)n-AIRd2<br>
wherein Ra, Rb, Rc ,and Rd are independently a Ci-C30 alkyl or halo-alkyl radical,<br>
for example methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, 2-methyl-propyl, pentyl, isopentyl,<br>
neopentyl, cyclopentyl, hexyl, isohexyl, cyclohexyl, heptyl, octyl, iso-octyl, 2-ethyl-<br>
hexyl, decyl, 2-phenyl-propyl, 2-(4-flurophenyl)-propyl, 2,3-dimethyl-butyl, 2,4,4-<br>
timethyl-pentyl and dodecyl; and n has the value of 2 to 50. Preferably n is at least<br>
4.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention the oligomerisation catalyst<br>
includes a combination of<br>
i) a source of Cr; and<br>
ii) a ligating compound of the formula<br>
(R1)m X1 (Y) X2 (R2)n<br>
wherein: X1 and X2 are independently selected from the group<br>
consisting of N, P, As, Sb, Bi, O, S and Se;<br>
Y is a linking group between X1 and X2;<br>
m and n are independently 0, 1 or a larger integer; and<br>
R1 and R2 are independently hydrogen, a hydrocarbyl group<br>
or a heterohydrocarbyl group, and R1 being the same or<br>
different when m&gt;1, and R2 being the same or different when<br>
n&gt;1.<br>
In this specification a heterohydrocarbyl group is a hydrocarbyl<br>
group which includes at least one heteroatom (that is not being H or C), and which<br>
organic compound binds with one or more other moieties through one or more<br>
carbon atoms of the organic compound and/or one or more heteroatoms of the<br>
organic compound. Organoheteryl groups and organyl groups (which include at<br>
least one heteroatom) are examples of heterohydrocarbyl groups.<br>
Preferably the ligating compound is of the formula<br>
<br>
with R3 to R7 as defined above.<br>
Preferably each of R3 to R6 is an alkyl (preferably methyl, ethyl or<br>
isopropyl) or aromatic (preferably phenyl or substituted phenyl).<br>

The invention will now be described, by way of example, with<br>
reference to the accompanying drawings in which<br>
Figure 1 shows one embodiment of a process in accordance with the<br>
invention for polymerising or oligomerising a hydrocarbon;<br>
Figure 2 shows another, more complex embodiment of a process in<br>
accordance with the invention for polymerising or oligomerising a hydrocarbon;<br>
Figure 3 shows a graph of the load on an agitator, represented by hydraulic<br>
drive pump differential pressure, in a pilot plant oligomerisation reactor subjected<br>
to fouling caused by the precipitation of polymer on the agitator;<br>
Figure 4 shows graphs of axial pilot plant reactor temperature profile and<br>
agitator speed, for the pilot plant reactor of Figure 3;<br>
Figure 5 shows a graph of the bubble point temperature of a binary<br>
ethylene/propane system as a function of ethylene concentration, at a pressure of<br>
48 bar(a); and<br>
Figure 6 shows a graph of the bubble point temperature of a binary<br>
ethylene/chlorodifluoromethane system as a function of ethylene concentration, at<br>
a pressure of 48 bar(a).<br>
Referring to Figure 1 of the drawings, reference numeral 10<br>
generally indicates a process in accordance with the invention for polymerising or<br>
oligomerising a hydrocarbon. The process 10 as shown in the drawing is in<br>
particular for the tetramerisation, and to a lesser extent trimerisation, of ethylene<br>
but it can also be used for the polymerisation or oligomerisation of other olefinic<br>
feedstocks.<br>
The process 10 includes a reactor 12 containing a bulk liquid phase<br>
14 in the form of a bubbling column. The reactor 12 is thus a bubbling column<br>
reactor. Recycled liquid ethylene as hydrocarbon reactant and recycled liquid<br>
propane as evaporative cooling medium enter the bottom of the reactor 12 from a<br>
line 32 so that the liquid ethylene and liquid propane in use enter the bottom of the<br>
bubbling column of bulk liquid phase 14. A solvent line 23 joins the line 32. A<br>
catalyst line 25 leads into the reactor 12.<br>
A liquid phase withdrawal line 18, preferably with a bottom<br>
withdrawal point leaves from the reactor 12 to a treatment stage 20, with an<br>
oligomeric product line 22, a recovered ethylene and propane line 24, and a solids<br>
line 27 leaving the treatment stage 20. A gaseous components line 26 leaves<br>
from a top of the reactor 12 to a partial condenser 28 and leads from the partial<br>
condenser 28 to a separator 30. The recovered ethylene and propane line 24<br>
from the treatment stage 20 joins the gaseous components line 26 leading into the<br>
partial condenser 28. A propane make-up line 56 joins the line 32 and a fresh<br>
gaseous ethylene line 54 joins the recovered ethylene and propane line 24.<br>
The line 32 is a liquid ethylene and propane recycle line which leads<br>
from the separator 30 to the reactor 12, with a gaseous product line 34 also<br>
leading from the separator 30.<br>
In order to trimerise and tetramerise ethylene to produce 1-hexene<br>
and 1-octene, liquid ethylene (predominantly recycled but with a small portion of<br>
fresh ethylene) is fed by means of the line 32 into the bottom of the bulk liquid<br>
phase 14 inside the reactor 12. The reactor 12 is operated typically at a pressure<br>
of between about 45 bar(a) and 50 bar(a), with the bulk liquid phase 14 being at a<br>
temperature below its boiling point at the operating pressure of the reactor 12.<br>
Typically, this temperature is about 60Â°C.<br>
The bulk liquid phase 14 of the bubbling column includes an<br>
admixture of ethylene, oligomeric products, a solvent which includes a dissolved<br>
catalyst system, propane as evaporative cooling medium, and small amounts of<br>
solids formed by undesirable side reactions. Typical mass concentrations<br>
dissolved in the liquid phase are about 20 - 25 mass % ethylene, 5-15 mass %<br>
oligomeric product, 5-10 mass % solvent and 50 - 70 mass % propane as<br>
evaporative cooling medium. The mass fraction of propane in ethylene in the feed<br>
line 32 is 0.5. Fast rising bubbles of vapourised ethylene and propane pass<br>
upwardly through the bubbling column of bulk liquid phase 14. In the embodiment<br>
of the invention shown in Figure 1, the solvent is a C8 paraffin (Isopar-C), with the<br>
catalyst system comprising Cr (chromium), (phenyl)2PN(isopropyl)P(phenyl)2<br>
ligand and methyl aluminoxane as activator.<br>
The reactor 12 with the particular catalyst system primarily produces<br>
1-hexene and 1-octene from ethylene. In other words, the reactor 12 primarily<br>
trimerises and tetramerises the ethylene. The oligomerisation reactions taking<br>
place inside the reactor 12 are exothermic. The heat of reaction is sufficient to<br>
provide the energy required to heat the incoming liquid ethylene and liquid<br>
propane feed to 60Â°C and to maintain the bulk liquid phase at a temperature<br>
below its boiling temperature but above the boiling temperature of the liquid<br>
ethylene and liquid propane mixture thereby to vapourise liquid ethylene and liquid<br>
propane in the bulk liquid phase 14, ensuring that the bulk liquid phase 14 is in the<br>
form of a bubbling column. The vapourisation of the liquid ethylene and liquid<br>
propane and hence the formation of fast rising gas bubbles creates vigorous<br>
mixing inside the bulk liquid phase 14, turning the bulk liquid phase 14 into a<br>
bubbling column. This is important and advantageous in the embodiment of the<br>
invention shown in Figure 1, as it may allow the reactor 12 to operate without a<br>
stirrer or agitator, which, if present, may be susceptible to fouling. Temperature<br>
control of the reactor 12 is effected by means of flashing of liquid ethylene and<br>
liquid propane so there is no need for a heat exchanger in direct contact with the<br>
bulk liquid phase 14 to remove heat from the bulk liquid phase 14 (i.e. direct-<br>
contact cooling or so-called "hot cooling" is employed, using the inert liquid<br>
propane as evaporative cooling medium in combination with evaporation of liquid<br>
ethylene reactant).<br>
In general, ethylene oligomerisation processes form small quantities<br>
of solids and process designs are required that can handle this material. One<br>
solution is to design a catalyst or catalyst system which can be used at a<br>
temperature high enough to have the fouling polymer solids in solution, thereby to<br>
prevent fouling. Alternatively, if the operating temperature of the process is too<br>
low so that precipitation will occur, a conventional approach is to use an external<br>
heat exchanger to prevent contact of heat exchange surfaces and process fluids<br>
with the fouling polymers. With the process of the invention as illustrated in Figure<br>
1, a liquid hydrocarbon feed that has a boiling temperature lower than the bulk<br>
temperature of the liquid phase of the bubbling column at the reaction pressure is<br>
used so that, on contact with the bulk liquid phase, the liquid hydrocarbon will<br>
vapourise rapidly releasing bubbles that induce turbulence and generate sufficient<br>
mixing in the reactor. This can eliminate the requirement for an agitator and<br>
hence agitator fouling as a reason for plant shutdown, extending run times and<br>
increasing plant availability and hence reducing the need for increased plant size<br>
to meet capacity requirements. Given that phase change results in a large<br>
change in density for a given mass of liquid hydrocarbon fed into the reactor, a<br>
significant amount of work can be carried out on the bulk liquid phase bubbling<br>
column by vapourising the liquid hydrocarbon stream in the bulk liquid phase,<br>
while maintaining an isothermal reaction environment. Given that a fouling<br>
process such as a tetramerisation process requires periodic cleaning, the fact that<br>
an agitator may not be needed to maintain good mixing under reaction conditions<br>
allows a more tailored design to be implemented to allow for optimisation of a<br>
reactor cleaning step.<br>
<br>
The liquid phase is withdrawn through the liquid phase withdrawal<br>
line 18 to maintain the bulk liquid phase 14 at a desired level within the reactor 12.<br>
A catalyst kill reagent, e.g. an alcohol such as ethanol, may be introduced to the<br>
withdrawn liquid product stream to prevent further reaction. The liquid phase is<br>
treated in the treatment stage 20, providing an unreacted or recovered gaseous<br>
ethylene and propane stream which is withdrawn along line 24 and eventually<br>
returned in liquid form to the reactor 12 (together with any make-up liquid propane<br>
fed by means of the make-up propane line 56 and fresh ethylene fed by means of<br>
the gaseous ethylene line 54), via the partial condenser 28, separator 30 and the<br>
recycle line 32.<br>
An oligomeric product is withdrawn from the treatment stage 20 by<br>
means of the oligomeric product line 22, and small amounts of solids are<br>
withdrawn through the solids line 27. In Figure 1, the treatment stage 20 is<br>
represented by a single block. In practice, the separation of unreacted ethylene<br>
and liquid propane and polymer solids that may have formed from the liquid phase<br>
requires a complex series of separation steps typically including at least one<br>
distillation or flash stage and possibly one compression stage. As the recovery of<br>
unreacted ethylene and propane and separation of solids from the liquid product is<br>
however peripheral to the present invention, this will not be discussed in any more<br>
detail.<br>
The process 10 will typically also include recovering the solvent from<br>
the oligomeric product. The solvent is then returned to the reactor 12. Recovery<br>
is typically effected using a distillation column, but the details of this recovery are<br>
also not required for an understanding of the present invention and will not be<br>
discussed in any detail.<br>
Gaseous components, including unreacted vapourised ethylene and<br>
vapourised propane and any gaseous product that may have formed in the reactor<br>
12, are collected in a headspace above the bulk liquid phase 14 and withdrawn<br>
through the gaseous components line 26. The gaseous components may also<br>
<br>
include light impurities, such as hydrogen, methane which may have entered the<br>
process 10 with the liquid ethylene feed and ethane formed in the reactor 12 as a<br>
by-product. Methane may also be liberated in a catalyst deactivation reaction,<br>
particularly when the catalyst includes an aluminium specie, as a result of the<br>
reaction of an alcohol with the aluminium specie. The partial pressure of light<br>
impurities, e.g. methane and ethane, in the reactor 12 should be minimised as far<br>
as practically possible, to increase the ethylene partial pressure thereby<br>
increasing the ethylene concentration in the bulk liquid phase 14, and hence<br>
increasing the productivity of the reactor 12.<br>
In the partial condenser 28, the gaseous components withdrawn<br>
along the gaseous components line 26 are cooled, forming a mixture of<br>
condensed ethylene and propane which is knocked out in the separator 30 and<br>
returned to the reactor 12 by means of the liquid ethylene recycle line 32.<br>
Advantageously, by selecting appropriate operating conditions and an appropriate<br>
propane concentration in the bulk liquid phase 14, it is possible to raise the bubble<br>
point temperature of the ethylene and propane mixture sufficiently high, e.g.<br>
preferentially above 30Â°C, more preferentially above 40 Â°C, so that plant cooling<br>
water can be used in the partial condenser 28 to condense the bulk of the vapour<br>
introduced into the condensor, i.e. at least 99 molar % of vapour introduced into<br>
the condensor, in stead of refrigerated water which would be the case if propane<br>
was not present in a sufficiently high concentration. Thus, as illustrated by Figure<br>
5, a propane concentration higher than about 45 % by mass, e.g. about 55 % by<br>
mass, in the vapour entering the partial condenser 28 will allow plant cooling<br>
water to be used as cooling utility in the partial condenser 28. The lower limit of<br>
the propane concentration will naturally be affected by the concentration of other<br>
inert lights, such as methane and ethane, in the gaseous stream entering the<br>
partial condenser 28. In stead of propane, other inert hydrocarbons, such as<br>
chlorodifluoromethane can be used as evaporative cooling medium. As can be<br>
seen from Figure 6, a chlorodifluoromethane mass concentration higher than<br>
about 60 %, e.g. about 70 % will allow plant cooling water to be used as cooling<br>
utility in the partial condenser 28.<br>
<br>
Uncondensed gaseous components, i.e. gaseous product and some<br>
gaseous inerts, are withdrawn from the separator 30 by means of the gaseous<br>
product line 34. Although not shown in Figure 1 of the drawings, the process 10<br>
may include treating the gaseous product withdrawn by means of the gaseous<br>
product line 34 to recover uncondensed unreacted ethylene and possibly<br>
uncondensed propane from the gaseous product. Typically, such a treatment will<br>
include at least one distillation stage operating at a lower pressure and a lower<br>
temperature than the reactor 12, producing ethylene and propane which can be<br>
recycled to the reactor 12.<br>
Naturally, the process 10 may include treating the oligomeric product<br>
from the treatment stage 20 to separate desired components, such as 1-hexene,<br>
1-octene, a cyclic C6 product and a C10+ product and solvent. Such separation<br>
will typically take place in distillation columns.<br>
Referring to Figure 2 of the drawings, a more complex embodiment<br>
of the process in accordance with the invention is generally indicated by reference<br>
numeral 50. In Figure 2, the same reference numerals have been used as far as<br>
possible as have been used in Figure 1 to indicate the same or similar parts or<br>
features.<br>
The process 50 includes two reactors 12.1 and 12.2. The reactors<br>
12.1 and 12.2 are in series as far as the bulk liquid phase 14 is concerned and a<br>
liquid phase transfer line 52 is thus provided to transfer liquid phase from the<br>
reactor 12.1 to the reactor 12.2. As far as the liquid ethylene feed is concerned,<br>
the reactors 12.1 and 12.2 are however in parallel so that the liquid ethylene feed<br>
enters both reactors 12.1 and 12.2 at their bottoms, via line 32.<br>
Liquid phase is transferred from the reactor 12.1 to the reactor 12.2<br>
by means of the liquid phase transfer line 52 (where the impetus for transfer is<br>
provided by a difference in pressure between reactors 12.1 and 12.2), before<br>
<br>
being withdrawn by means of the liquid phase withdrawal line 18. Recycled liquid<br>
ethylene and liquid propane and fresh ethylene feed introduced by means of the<br>
gaseous ethylene feed line 54 are however fed in parallel by means of the liquid<br>
ethylene recycle line 32 into the bottoms of the reactors 12.1 and 12.2.<br>
Although not shown in Figure 2, the process 50 may naturally<br>
include a treatment stage such as the treatment stage 20 to recover ethylene and<br>
propane from the liquid phase withdrawn by means of the liquid phase withdrawal<br>
line 18, as well as further treatment stages to recover and recycle solvent and to<br>
recover unreacted ethylene and uncondensed propane from the gaseous product<br>
withdrawn by means of the gaseous product line 34.<br>
The Applicant has performed cold model experiments on a<br>
vapourising butane system to understand the effects of rapid vapourisation on<br>
bulk mixing and circulation. The butane system consisted of a water-filled 10-litre<br>
glass vessel with an inside diameter of 20cm, into which sub-cooled liquid butane<br>
was fed through a single quarter inch tube. A colour (potassium permanganate)<br>
tracer was added to highlight flow patterns and local velocities.<br>
When the butane was simply fed into the water, it was clear that all<br>
of the butane immediately bubbled upwards in a plume from the injector, imparting<br>
very little mixing to the liquid below that point. Zones outside of the plume of<br>
rising butane showed low flow and low turbulence. Distinct zones of high and low<br>
mixing could be discerned inside the reactor, evidenced by the absence of<br>
bubbles in the low flow regions. This has been confirmed by results of CFD<br>
simulation. These phenomena explain the behaviour of a tetramerisation piloting<br>
reactor operated by the Applicant, where excessive polymer build-up on the<br>
bottom dish is believed to be due to low turbulence under the ethylene injector<br>
entering the pilot scale reactor from the side.<br>
When the butane injector was arranged so that injected butane<br>
impinges against a bottom dish of the glass vessel, low flow regions were<br>
<br>
eliminated and even dissipation of energy in the bulk of the water was promoted,<br>
as evidenced by a more uniform bubble size distribution throughout the liquid.<br>
The liquid bulk appeared murky, indicative of fine bubbles distributed throughout<br>
the liquid. This suggests that careful consideration must be given to the manner in<br>
which the liquid ethylene and liquid propane are fed into the bubbling column of<br>
bulk liquid phase to ensure even distribution of ethylene and propane bubbles<br>
throughout the bulk liquid phase, when the process of the invention is employed.<br>
The Applicant believes that the process 10, 50, as illustrated, is less<br>
prone to the risk of fouling, compared to conventional processes for polymerising<br>
or oligomerising a hydrocarbon. This risk of fouling, for conventional<br>
polymerisation or oligomerisation processes, particularly those including an<br>
agitator in the reactor, is a significant problem. Figure 3 illustrates the increased<br>
load on an agitator with time on stream under reaction conditions due to<br>
precipitation of polymer on the agitator of an oligomerisation pilot plant making<br>
use of an hydraulic drive. Liquid ethylene was used as a feed. As will be noted,<br>
the hydraulic drive pump differential pressure increases with increasing load to<br>
maintain the agitator at a target speed. This increased load is caused by fouling<br>
of the agitator. Figure 4 shows that switching off the agitator of said pilot plant<br>
reactor is not detrimental to the axial reactor temperature profile in said reactor.<br>
Although there is a temperature oscillation when the agitator is switched off,<br>
caused by non-optimised control tuning, it will be noted that the temperature<br>
profile of each of the axially located thermocouples is consistent with the others<br>
and remains within a tight temperature tolerance.<br>
By using a suitable evaporative cooling medium, the process 10, 50, as<br>
illustrated, allows the use of plant cooling water as cooling utility for the<br>
condensation of the bulk of the gaseous components withdrawn from the bulk<br>
liquid phase. This obviates the need for an external refrigeration unit for the partial<br>
condenser 28, which provides a significant capital and operating cost advantage<br>
for the process 10, 50, as illustrated, compared to conventional processes for<br>
polymerising or oligomerising a hydrocarbon.<br>
