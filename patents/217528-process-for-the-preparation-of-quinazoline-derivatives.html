				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The invention relates to processes for the manufacture of quinazoline derivatives, or pharmaceutically-acceptable salts thereof, which possess anti-proliferative activity such as anti-cancer activity and are accordingly useful in methods of treatment of the human or animal body. The invention also relates to pharmaceutical compositions containing said quinazoline derivatives and to processes for the manufacture of medicaments of use in the production of an anti-proliferative effect in a warm-blooded animal such as man.<br>
Many of the current treatment regimes for cell proliferation diseases such as psoriasis and cancer utilise compounds which inhibit DNA synthesis. Such compounds are toxic to cells generally but their toxic effect on rapidly dividing cells such as tumour cells can be beneficial. Alternative approaches to anti-proliferative agents which act by mechanisms other than the inhibition of DNA synthesis have the potential to display enhanced selectivity of action.<br>
In recent years it has been discovered that a cell may become cancerous by virtue of the transformation of a portion of its DNA into an oncogene i.e. a gene which, on activation, leads to the formation of malignant tumour cells (Bradshaw, Mutagenesis, 1986, 1_, 91). Several such oncogenes give rise to the production of peptides which are receptors for growth factors. The growth factor receptor complex subsequently leads to an increase in cell proliferation. It is known, for example, that several oncogenes encode tyrosine kinase enzymes and that certain growth factor receptors are also tyrosine kinase enzymes (Yarden et al., Ann. Rev. Biochem., 1988, 57, 443; Larsen et al. Ann. Reports in Med. Chem. 1989, Chpt. 13).<br>
Receptor tyrosine kinases are important in the transmission of biochemical signals which initiate cell replication. They are large enzymes which span the cell membrane and possess an extracellular binding domain for growth factors such as epidermal growth factor (EGF) and an intracellular portion which functions as a kinase to phosphorylate tyrosine amino acids in proteins and hence to influence cell proliferation. Various classes of receptor tyrosine kinases are known (Wilks, Advances in Cancer Research, 1993, 60,43-73) based on families of growth factors which bind to different receptor tyrosine kinases. The classification includes Class I receptor tyrosine kinases comprising the EGF family of receptor tyrosine kinases such as the EGF, TGFa, NEU, erbB, Xmrk, HER and let23 receptors, Class II receptor tyrosine kinases comprising the insulin family of receptor tyrosine<br>
receptors, Class II receptor tyrosine kinases comprising the insulin family of receptor tyrosine kinases such as the insulin, IGFI and insulin-related receptor (IRR) receptors and Class III receptor tyrosine kinases comprising the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) family of receptor tyrosine kinases such as the PDGFa, PDGFP and colony-stimulating factor 1 (CSFl) receptors. It is known that Class I kinases such as the EGF family of receptor tyrosine kinases are frequently present in common human cancers such as breast cancer (Sainsbury et al., Brit. J. Cancer, 1988, 58, 458; Guerin et aL, Oncogene Res., 1988, 3, 21 and Klijn et_aL, Breast Cancer Res. Treat., 1994, 29, 73), non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) including adenocarcinomas (Cemy et al., Brit. J. Cancer, 1986, 54, 265; Reubi et al.. Int. J. Cancer. 1990,45, 269; and Rusch et_aL, Cancer Research, 1993, 53, 2379) and squamous cell cancer of the lung (Hendler etal., Cancer Cells, 1989, 7, 347), bladder cancer (Neal et al.. Lancet, 1985, 366), oesophageal cancer (Mukaida etal., Cancer, 1991, 68, 142), gastrointestinal cancer such as colon, rectal or stomach cancer (Bolen et al.. Oncogene Res., 1987, i, 149), cancer of the prostate (Visakorpi et al., Histochem. J., 1992,24, 481), leukaemia (Konaka et al.. Cell, 1984, 37,1035) and ovarian, bronchial or pancreatic cancer (European Patent Specification No. 0400586). As further human tumour tissues are tested for the EGF family of receptor tyrosine kinases it is expected that their widespread prevalance will be established in further cancers such as thyroid and uterine cancer. It is also known that EGF type tyrosine kinase activity is rarely detected in normal cells whereas it is more frequently detectable in malignant cells (Hunter, Cell, 1987, 50, 823). It has been shown more recently (W J Gullick, Brit. Med. Bull.. 1991, 47, 87) that EGF receptors which possess tyrosine kinase activity are overexpressed in many human cancers such as brain, lung squamous cell, bladder, gastric, breast, head and neck, oesophageal, gynaecological and thyroid tumours.<br>
Accordingly it has been recognised that an inhibitor of receptor tyrosine kinases should be of value as a selective inhibitor of the growth of mammalian cancer cells (Yaish et aL Science, 1988, 242, 933). Support for this view is provided by the demonstration that erbstatin, an EGF receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor, specifically attenuates the growth in athymic nude mice of a transplanted human mammary carcinoma which expresses EGF receptor tyrosine kinase but is without effect on the growth of another carcinoma which does not express EGF receptor tyrosine kinase (Toi et aL, Eur. J. Cancer Clin. Oncol., 1990, 26, 722.) Various derivatives of styrene are also stated to possess tyrosine kinase inhibitory<br>
properties (European Patent Application Nos. 0211363, 0304493 and 0322738) and to be of use as anti-tumour agents. The in vivo inhibitory effect of two such styrene derivatives which are EGF receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors has been demonstrated against the growth of human squamous cell carcinoma inoculated into nude mice (Yoneda et al., Cancer Research, 1991, 5_i, 4430). Various known tyrosine kinase inhibitors are disclosed in a more recent review by T R Burke Jr. (Drugs of the Future. 1992, 17, 119).<br>
It is known from European Patent Applications Nos. 0520722, 0566226 and 0635498 that certain quinazoline derivatives which bear an anilino substituent at the 4-position possess receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitory activity. It is further known from European Patent Application No. 0602851 that certain quinazoline derivatives which bear a heteroarylamino substituent at the 4-position also possess receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitory activity.<br>
It is further known from International Patent Application WO 92/20642 that certain aryl and heteroaryl compounds inhibit EGF and/or PDGF receptor tyrosine kinase. There is the disclosure of certain quinazoline derivatives therein but no mention is made of 4-anilinoquinazoline derivatives.<br>
The in vitro anti-proliferative effect of a 4-anilinoquinazoline derivative has been disclosed by Fry et al, Science, 1994, 265, 1093. It was stated that the compound 4-(3'-bromoanilino)-6,7-dimethoxyquinazoline was a highly potent inhibitor of EGF receptor tyrosine kinase.<br>
The in vivo inhibitory effect of a 4,5-dianilinophthalimide derivative which is an inhibitor of the EGF family of receptor tyrosine kinases has been demonstrated against the growth in BALB/c nude mice of a human epidermoid carcinoma A-431 or of a human ovarian carcinoma SKOV-3 (Buchdunger et al., Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci.. 1994, 91, 2334).<br>
It is further known from European Patent Application No. 0635507 that certain tricyclic compounds which comprise a 5- or 6-membered ring fused to the benzo-ring of a quinazoline possess receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitory activity. It is also known from European Patent Application No. 0635498 that certain quinazoline derivatives which carry an amino group at the 6-position and a halogeno group at the 7-position possess receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitory activity.<br>
Accordingly it has been indicated that Class I receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors will prove to be useful in the treatment of a variety of human cancers.<br>
EGF type receptor tyrosine kinases have also been implicated in non-malignant proliferative disorders such as psoriasis (Elder et al., Science, 1989, 243, 811). It is therefore expected that inhibitors of EGF type receptor tyrosine kinases will be useful in the treatment of non-malignant diseases of excessive cellular proliferation such as psoriasis (where TGFα is believed to be the most important growth factor), benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH), atherosclerosis and restenosis.<br>
There is no disclosure in these documents of quinazoline derivatives which bear at the 4-position an anilino substituent and which also bear an alkoxy substituent at the 7-position and a dialkylaminoalkoxy substituent at the 6-position. We have now found that such compounds possess potent in vivo anti-proliferative properties which are believed to arise from their Class I receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitory activity.<br>

As stated hereinbefore the quinazoline derivatives defined in the present<br>
invention possess anti-proliferative activity which is believed to arise from the Class I<br>
receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitory activity of the compounds. These properties may be<br>
assessed, for example, using one or more of the procedures set out below:-<br>
(a)	An in vitro assay which determines the ability of a test compound to inhibit the<br>
enzyme EGF receptor tyrosine kinase. Receptor tyrosine kinase was obtained in partially purified form from A-431 cells (derived from human vulval carcinoma) by the procedures<br>
described below which are related to those described by Carpenter et al, J. Biol. Chem., 1979, 254, 4884, Cohen et al, J. Biol. Chem.. 1982, 257, 1523 and by Braun et ah,   J. Biol. Chem., 1984,259,2051.<br>
A-431 cells were grown to confluence using Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 5% fetal calf serum (FCS). The obtained cells were homogenised in a hypotonic borate/EDTA buffer at pH 10.1. The homogenate was centrifuged at 400 g for 10 minutes at 0-4°C. The supernatant was centrifuged at 25,000 g for 30 minutes at 0-4°C. The pelleted material was suspended in 30 mM Hepes buffer at pH 7.4 containing 5% glycerol, 4 mM benzamidine and 1% Triton X-100, stirred for 1 hour at 0-4°C, and recentrifuged at 100,000 g for 1 hour at 0-4°C. The supernatant, containing solubilised receptor tyrosine kinase, was stored in liquid nitrogen.<br>
For test purposes 40 /xl of the enzyme solution so obtained was added to a mixture of 400 /xl of a mixture of 150 mM Hepes buffer at pH 7.4, 500 /xM sodium orthovanadate, 0.1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 200 /xl water, 80 /xl of 25 mM DTT and 80/xl of a mixture of 12.5 mM manganese chloride, 125 mM magnesium chloride and distilled water. There was thus obtained the test enzyme solution.<br>
Each test compound was dissolved in dimethylsulphoxide (DMSO) to give a 50 mM solution which was diluted with 40 mM Hepes buffer containing 0.1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol and 10% DMSO to give a 500 µM solution. Equal volumes of this solution and a solution of epidermal growth factor (EGF; 20 µg/ml) were mixed.<br>
[-32p]ATP (3000 Ci/mM, 250 /µCi) was diluted to a volume of 2 ml by the addition of a solution of ATP (100 /xM) in distilled water. An equal volume of a 4 mg/ml solution of the peptide Arg-Arg-Leu-IIe-Glu-Asp-Ala-Glu-Tyr-Ala-Ala-Arg-Gly in a mixture of 40 mM Hepes buffer at pH 7.4, 0.1% Triton X-100 and 10% glycerol was added.<br>
The test compound/EGF mixture solution (5 µl) was added to the test enzyme solution (10 µl) and the mixture was incubated at 0-4°C for 30 minutes. The ATP/peptide mixture (10 µl) was added and the mixture was incubated at 25°C for 10 minutes. The phosphorylation reaction was terminated by the addition of 5% trichloroacetic acid (40 µl) and bovine serum albumin (BSA; 1 mg/ml, 5 µl). The mixture was allowed to stand at 4°C for 30 minutes and then centrifuged. An aliquot (40 µl) of the supernatant was placed onto a strip of Whatman p 81 phosphocellulose paper. The strip was washed in 75 mM phosphoric acid (4 x 10 ml) and blotted dry. Radioactivity present in the filter paper was measured using<br>
a liquid scintillation counter (Sequence A). The reaction sequence was repeated in the absence of the EGF (Sequence B) and again in the absence of the test compound (Sequence C).<br>
Receptor tyrosine kinase inhibition was calculated as follows:- <br>
(Sequence Removed)<br>
C-B The extent of inhibition was then determined at a range of concentrations of test compound to give an IC50 value.<br>
(b)	An in vitro assay which determines the ability of a test compound to inhibit the<br>
EGF-stimulated growth of the human naso-pharyngeal cancer cell line KB.<br>
KB cells were seeded into wells at a density of 1 x 104 - 1.5 x 104 cells per well and grown for 24 hours in DMEM supplemented with 5% FCS (charcoal-stripped). Cell growth was determined after incubation for 3 days by the extent of metabolism of MTT tetrazolium dye to furnish a bluish colour. Cell growth was then determined in the presence of EGF (10 ng/ml) or in the presence of EGF (10 ng/ml) and a test compound at a range of concentrations. An IC50 value could then be calculated.<br>
(c)	An in-vivo assay in a group of athymic nude mice (strain ONU:Alpk) which<br>
determines the ability of a test compound (usually administered orally as a ball-milled<br>
suspension in 0.5% polysorbate) to inhibit the growth of xenografts of the human vulval<br>
epidermoid carcinoma cell line A-431.<br>
A-431 cells were maintained in culture in DMEM supplemented with 5% FCS and 2mM glutamine. Freshly cultured cells were harvested by trypsinization and injected subcutaneously (10 million cells/0.1 ml/mouse) into both flanks of a number of donor nude mice. When sufficient tumour material was available (after approximately 9 to 14 days), fragments of tumour tissue were transplanted in the flanks of recipient nude mice (test day 0). Generally, on the seventh day after transplantation (test day 7) groups of 7 to 10 mice with similar-sized tumours were selected and dosing of the test compound was commenced. Once daily dosing of test compound was continued for a total of 13 days (test days 7 to 19 inclusive). In some studies the dosing of the test compound was continued beyond test day 19, for example to test day 26. In each case, on the following test day the animals were killed and the final tumour volume was calculated from measurements of the length and width of the<br>
tumours. Results were calculated as a percentage inhibition of tumour volume relative to untreated controls.<br>
Although the pharmacological properties of the compounds of the formula I vary with structural change as expected, in general activity possessed by compounds of the formula I may be demonstrated at the following concentrations or doses in one or more of the above tests (a), (b) and (c):-<br>
Test (a):- IC50 in the range, for example, 0.01-1 /iM; Test (b):- IC50 in the range, for example, 0.05-1 /iM; Test (c):- 20 to 90% inhibition of tumour volume from a<br>
daily dose in the range, for example, 12.5 to 200 mg/kg.<br>
Thus, by way of example, the compounds described in the accompanying Examples possess activity at approximately the following concentrations or doses in tests (a) and (b).<br><br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
In addition all of the compounds described in the accompanying Examples possess activity in test (c) with ED50 values of less than or equal to 200 mg/kg/day. In particular, the compound described in Example 1 hereinafter possesses activity in test (c) with an ED50 value of approximately 12.5 mg/kg.<br>
According to a further aspect of the invention there is provided a process for the preparation of a pharmaceutical composition which comprises bringing into admixture a quinazoline derivative of the formula I, or a pharmaceutically-acceptable salt thereof, as defined hereinbefore and a pharmaceutically-acceptable diluent or carrier.<br>
The composition may be in a form suitable for oral administration, for example as a tablet or capsule, for parenteral injection (including intraveous, subcutaneous, intramuscular, intravascular or infusion) as a sterile solution, suspension or emulsion, for topical administration as an ointment or cream or for rectal administration as a suppository.<br>
In general the above compositions may be prepared in a conventional manner using conventional excipients.<br>
The quinazoline derivative will normally be administered to a warm-blooded animal at a unit dose within the range 5-10000 mg per square meter body area of the animal, i.e. approximately 0.1-200 mg/kg, and this normally provides a therapeutically-effective dose. A unit dose form such as a tablet or capsule will usually contain, for example 1-250 mg of active ingredient. Preferably a daily dose in the range of 1-100 mg/kg is employed. For the quinazoline derivative of Example 1, or a pharmaceutically-acceptable salt thereof, a daily dose of approximately 1 to 20 mg/kg, preferably of 1 to 5 mg/kg is employed. However the<br>
daily dose will necessarily be varied depending upon the host treated, the particular route of administration, and the severity of the illness being treated. Accordingly the optimum dosage may be determined by the practitioner who is treating any particular patient.<br>
We have found that the compounds of the present invention possess anti-proliferative properties such as anti-cancer properties which are believed to arise from their Class I receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitory activity. Accordingly the compounds of the present invention are expected to be useful in the treatment of diseases or medical conditions mediated alone or in part by Class I receptor tyrosine kinases, i.e. the compounds may be used to produce a Class I receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitory effect in a warm-blooded animal in need of such treatment. Thus the compounds of the present invention provide a method for treating the proliferation of malignant cells characterised by inhibition of Class I receptor tyrosine kinases, i.e. the compounds may be used to produce an anti-proliferative effect mediated alone or in part by the inhibition of Class I receptor tyrosine kinase. Accordingly the compounds of the present invention are expected to be useful in the treatment of psoriasis and/or cancer by providing an anti-proliferative effect, particularly in the treatment of Class I receptor tyrosine kinase sensitive cancers such as cancers of the breast, lung, colon, rectum, stomach, prostate, bladder, pancreas and ovary.<br>
Thus according to this aspect of the invention there is provided a process for the manufacture of a medicament for use in the production of an anti-proliferative effect in a warm-blooded animal which comprises bringing into admixture a quinazoline derivative of the formula I, or a pharmaceutically-acceptable salt thereof, as defined hereinbefore and a pharmaceutically-acceptable diluent or carrier.<br>
As stated above the size of the dose required for the therapeutic or prophylactic treatment of a particular proliferative disease will necessarily be varied depending on the host treated, the route of administration and the severity of the illness being treated. A unit dose in the range, for example, 1-200 mg/kg, preferably 1-100 mg/kg, more preferably 1-10 mg/kg is envisaged.<br>
The anti-proliferative treatment defined hereinbefore may be applied as a sole therapy or may involve, in addition to the quinazoline derivative of the invention, one or more other anti-tumour substances, for example cytotoxic or cytostatic anti-tumour substances, for example those selected from, for example, mitotic inhibitors, for example vinblastine, vindesine and vinorelbine; tubulin disassembly inhibitors such as taxol; alkylating agents, for<br>
example cis-platin, carboplatin and cyclophosphamide; antimetabolites, for example 5-fluorouracil, tegafur, methotrexate, cytosine arabinoside and hydroxyurea, or, for example, one of the preferred antimetabolites disclosed in European Patent Application No. 239362 such as N-{ 5-[N-(3,4-dihydro-2-methyl-4-oxoquinazolin-6-ylmethyl)-N-methylamino]-2-thenoyl}-L-glutamic acid; intercalating antibiotics, for example adriamycin, mitomycin and bleomycin; enzymes, for example asparaginase; topoisomerase inhibitors, for example etoposide and camptothecin; biological response modifiers, for example interferon; anti-hormones, for example antioestrogens such as tamoxifen, for example antiandrogens such as4'-cyano-3-(4-fluorophenylsulphonyl)-2-hydroxy-2-methyl-3'-(trifluoromethyl)-propionanilide or, for example LHRH antagonists or LHRH agonists such as goserelin, leuprorelin or buserelin and hormone synthesis inhibitors, for example aromatase inhibitors such as those disclosed in European Patent Application No. 0296749, for example 2,2'-[5-(1H-1,2,4- triazol-l-ylmethyl)-l,3-phenylene]bis(2-methylpropionitrile), and, for example, inhibitors of 5a-reductase such as 17|3-(N-tert-butylcarbamoyl)-4-aza-5a-androst-l-en-3-one. Such conjoint treatment may be achieved by way of the simultaneous, sequential or separate dosing of the individual components of the treatment. According to this aspect of the invention there is provided a process for the preparation of a pharmaceutical product comprising bringing into admixture a quinazoline derivative of the formula I as defined hereinbefore and an additional anti-tumour substance as defined hereinbefore for the conjoint treatment of cancer.<br>
As stated above the quinazoline derivative of the formula I is an effective anti-cancer agent, which property is believed to arise from its Class I receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitory properties. Such a quinazoline derivative of the formula I is expected to possess a wide range of anti-cancer properties as Class I receptor tyrosine kinases have been implicated in many common human cancers such as leukaemia and breast, lung, colon, rectal, stomach, prostate, bladder, pancreas and ovarian cancer. Thus it is expected that a quinazoline derivative of the formula I will possess anti-cancer activity against these cancers. It is in addition expected that a quinazoline derivative of the formula I will possess activity against a range of leukaemias, lymphoid malignancies and solid tumours such as carcinomas and sarcomas in tissues such as the liver, kidney, prostate and pancreas.<br>
It is further expected that a quinazoline derivative of the formula I will possess activity against other diseases involving excessive cellular proliferation such as psoriasis and benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH).<br>
It is also to be expected that a quinazoline derivative of the invention will be useful in the treatment of additional disorders of cellular growth in which aberrant cell signalling by way of receptor tyrosine kinase enzymes or non-receptor tyrosine kinase enzymes, including as yet unidentified tyrosine kinase enzymes, are involved. Such disorders include, for example, inflammation, angiogenesis, vascular restenosis, immunological disorders, pancreatitis, kidney disease and blastocyte maturation and implantation.<br>
The invention will now be illustrated in the following non-limiting Examples in which, unless otherwise stated: -<br>
(i) evaporations were carried out by rotary evaporation in vacuo and work-up procedures were carried out after removal of residual solids such as drying agents by filtration, unless otherwise stated magnesium sulphate was used as a drying agent for organic solutions;<br>
(ii) operations were carried out at ambient temperature, that is in the range 18-25°C and under an atmosphere of an inert gas such as argon;<br>
(iii) column chromatography (by the flash procedure) and medium pressure liquid chromatography (MPLC) were performed on Merck Kieselgel silica (Art. 9385) or Merck Lichroprep RP-18 (Art. 9303) reversed-phase silica obtained from E. Merck, Darmstadt, Germany;<br>
(iv) yields are given for illustration only and are not necessarily the maximum attainable;<br>
(v) melting points were determined using a Mettler SP62 automatic melting point apparatus, an oil-bath apparatus or a Koffler hot plate apparatus.<br>
(vi) the structures of the end-products of the formula I were confirmed by nuclear (generally proton) magnetic resonance (NMR) and mass spectral techniques; proton magnetic resonance chemical shift values were measured on the delta scale and peak multiplicities are shown as follows: s, singlet; d, doublet; t, triplet; m, multiplet, unless otherwise stated end-products of the formula I were dissolved in CD3SOCD3 for the determination of NMR values;<br>
(vii) intermediates were not generally fully characterised and purity was assessed by thin layer chromatography (TLC), infra-red (IR) or NMR analysis; (viii) the following abbreviations have been used:-<br>
DMF	N,N-dimethylformamide;<br>
DMSO	dimethylsulphoxide;<br>
THF	tetrahydrofuran;<br>
DMA	N,N-dimethylacetamide.<br><br><br><br><br>
