METHOD AND SYSTEM FOR UTILIZING TRANSMIT LOCAL<br>
OSCILLATOR FOR IMPROVED CELL SEARCH AND MULTI-LINK<br>
COMMUNICATION IN MULTI-MODE DEVICE<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
[001] This invention relates in general to wireless cellular communication devices<br>
capable of multiple-input, multiple-output (MIMO) communication and/or receive<br>
diversity and, more particularly, to utilizing the transmit local oscillator (LO) to drive<br>
a receiver when the transmitter in not in use.<br>
2.	Description of the Related Art<br>
[002] A wireless communication device (WCD), such as a cellular telephone, for<br>
instance, is required to utilize multiple radio access technologies and multiple<br>
frequency bands when performing measurement and synchronization on<br>
communication cells. This occurs in the transition from switch-on to camp-on when<br>
locating the best cell on the best network and is maintained in Idle mode and in<br>
Dedicated mode. Although the WCD must cycle through the multiple radio access<br>
technologies and multiple bands, the operator (and end-user) desires a fast reaction<br>
time as the radio conditions change.<br>
[003] In a mobility context where the user and/or environment are moving, abrupt<br>
shadowing effects are common, e.g., when a device moves around a corner or cars<br>
move around a device. This often leads to repeated interruptions in communication.<br>
However, users demand mobile voice communication hardware and techniques that<br>
will provide seamless handovers when one link breaks. To ensure a seamless<br>
handover, the WCD must cycle through the multiple radio access technologies and<br>
multiple bands to perform measurements and synchronize on different communication<br><br><br>
cells. This is a time and resource limited process. Unfortunately, some radio access<br>
technologies such as WLAN or WAN, do not intrinsically support mobility and soft<br>
handoffs. Due to these technology limitations, prior art equipment can degrade the<br>
user experience.<br>
[004] The reaction time and performance of cell measurement and synchronization<br>
can be improved with the operation of two receivers simultaneously to perform<br>
concurrent multiple band searches, measurements, and synchronization. Several<br>
wireless standards, such as the 802.1 In standard defined by the Institute of Electrical<br>
and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), now require two or more receiver channels on the<br>
modem either for receive diversity, interference cancellation, or two-port Multiple-<br>
Input, Multiple-Output (MIMO). However, these receivers can not always be<br>
operated independently due to performance gains associated with receive diversity,<br>
interference cancellation, or two-port MIMO operation. A method is needed to<br>
identify opportunities when both receivers can be operated independently. In<br>
addition, the receivers typically share a single Local Oscillator (LO) and the receiver<br>
channels are, therefore, tuned to the same Radio Frequency (RF) center frequencies<br>
and channel bandwidths. The addition of a second receive LO to the WCD for the<br>
purpose of measuring other frequencies is not desirable from a complexity and cost<br>
standpoint.<br>
[005] Therefore a need exists to overcome the problems associated with the prior<br>
art as discussed above.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[006] The present invention, according to an embodiment, provides a novel and<br>
efficient multi-receiver wireless communication device that includes a transmitter, a<br>
transmit oscillator communicatively coupled to the transmitter, a receive oscillator<br>
communicatively coupled to a first receiver and second receiver, and a switching<br>
assembly having a first state in which the receive oscillator is coupled to the first and<br>
second receivers and a second state in which the receive oscillator is de-coupled from<br><br><br>
the second receiver and the transmit oscillator is coupled to the second receiver. The<br>
first receiver and the second receiver of the wireless communication device are able to<br>
operate independent of one another when the switching assembly is in the second<br>
state.<br>
[007] In accordance with a further embodiment, the present invention includes a<br>
processor operable to identify a communication mode of the wireless communication<br>
device and place the switching assembly in the second state in response to identifying<br>
a communication mode that at least temporarily does not utilize the transmitter.<br>
[008] In accordance with another feature of the present invention, the<br>
communication mode that at least temporarily does not utilize the transmitter is an<br>
initial cell search, an idle mode, a neighbor cell monitoring gap in a traffic mode, a<br>
Multimedia Broadcast Multicast Service monitoring of neighbor cell mode, a<br>
Multimedia Broadcast Multicast Service monitoring of unicast cell mode, or a traffic<br>
reception mode.<br>
[009] In accordance with an additional feature, the processor is operable to<br>
determine an acceptable coverage condition and a poor coverage condition and place<br>
the switching assembly in the second state in response to determining an acceptable<br>
coverage condition.<br>
[0010] In accordance with yet another feature, the processor is further operable to<br>
place the switching assembly in the first state in response to determining a poor<br>
coverage condition.<br>
[0011] In accordance with yet a further feature, the processor is operable to operate<br>
the first receiver and collect coverage statistics S1, operate the first receiver and the<br>
second receiver and collect statistics S2, determine the poor coverage condition if<br>
coverage statistics S2 exceed coverage statistics S1, and determine the acceptable<br>
coverage condition if coverage statistics S2 do not exceed coverage statistics S1.<br>
[0012] The present invention, according to yet another feature, is able to sample a<br>
first data rate, compare the first data rate to a first threshold value, and place the<br><br><br>
switching assembly in the second state in response to the receive data rate being less<br>
than the first threshold value.<br>
[0013] The present invention, in accordance with yet a further feature, includes a<br>
method for switching receiver operations in a multi-receiver wireless communication<br>
device, where the method includes the steps of decoupling the receive oscillator from<br>
the second receiver in response to determining that the transmitter state at least<br>
temporarily does not utilize the transmitter and coupling the transmit oscillator to the<br>
second receiver in response to determining that the transmitter state at least<br>
temporarily does not utilize the transmitter.<br>
[0014] In accordance with a further feature, an embodiment of the present invention<br>
includes operating the first receiver and the second receiver of the wireless<br>
communication device independent of one another in response to determining that the<br>
transmitter state at least temporarily does not utilize the transmitter.<br>
[0015] Other features that are considered as characteristic for the invention are set<br>
forth in the appended claims.<br>
[0016] Although the invention is illustrated and described herein as embodied in a<br>
method and system for utilizing a transmit local oscillator for improved cell search<br>
and multi-link communication in a multi-mode device, it is, nevertheless, not intended<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0030] As required, detailed embodiments of the present invention are disclosed<br>
herein; however, it is to be understood that the disclosed embodiments are merely<br>
exemplary of the invention, which can be embodied in various forms. Therefore,<br>
specific structural and functional details disclosed herein are not to be interpreted as<br>
limiting, but merely as a basis for the claims and as a representative basis for teaching<br>
one of ordinary skill in the art to variously employ the present invention in virtually<br>
any appropriately detailed structure. Further, the terms and phrases used herein are<br>
not intended to be limiting; but rather, to provide an understandable description of the<br>
invention. While the specification concludes with claims defining the features of the<br>
invention that are regarded as novel, it is believed that the invention will be better<br>
understood from a consideration of the following description in conjunction with the<br>
drawing figures, in which like reference numerals are carried forward.<br>
[0031] The terms "a" or "an", as used herein, are defined as one or more than one.<br>
The term "plurality," as used herein, is defined as two or more than two. The term<br>
"another," as used herein, is defined as at least a second or more. The terms<br>
"including" and/or "having," as used herein, are defined as comprising (i.e., open<br>
language). The term "coupled," as used herein, is defined as connected, although not<br>
necessarily directly, and not necessarily mechanically. As used herein, the term<br><br><br>
"about" or "approximately" applies to all numeric values, whether or not explicitly<br>
indicated. These terms generally refer to a range of numbers that one of skill in the art<br>
would consider equivalent to the recited values (i.e., having the same function or<br>
result). In many instances these terms may include numbers that are rounded to the<br>
nearest significant figure. The terms "program," "software application," and the like<br>
as used herein, are defined as a sequence of instructions designed for execution on a<br>
computer system. A "program," "computer program," or "software application" may<br>
include a subroutine, a function, a procedure, an object method, an object<br>
implementation, an executable application, an applet, a servlet, a source code, an<br>
object code, a shared library/dynamic load library and/or other sequence of<br>
instructions designed for execution on a computer system.<br>
[0032] Embodiments of the present invention advantageously make use of the<br>
transmit LO of a MIMO WCD any time there is no transmitter activity. By shifting<br>
the transmit LO to one of the two receive channels, the WCD is able to tune to a<br>
different frequency, band, or bandwidth and exploit the macro-diversity of a multiple-<br>
receiver device in a multi-Access Point (AP)/Base Station (BS) context. In addition to<br>
their normal function (receiver diversity, MIMO, etc.), the diversity receivers can also<br>
be used to speed up the search for neighbor cells and other radio access technologies<br>
(RAT).<br>
[0033] The present invention utilizes a MIMO mobile WCD that implements<br>
multiple radio front-ends for supporting single-link or multi-link modes where the<br>
mobile device is maintaining links to multiple distinct APs/BSs (not necessarily using<br>
the same technology). Advantageously, the RF front-end can easily switch from one<br>
mode to the other (MIMO/Multi-Link) at a minimum complexity increase. In other<br>
words, the present invention extends the utility of traditional RF-front-ends from pure<br>
MIMO functionalities to MIMO/Multi-Link functionalities with just a slight<br>
modification of the RF-front-end.<br>
[0034] System Diagram<br>
[0035] The following drawings will be helpful in understanding the present<br>
invention. Turning now to FIG. 1, a diagram of one embodiment of a network 100, in<br><br><br>
accordance with the present invention is shown. A WCD 102 is illustrated. The<br>
WCD 102 communicates with a first Base Station (BS) Subsystem 104 to link to other<br>
WCDs 103. BSs are the parts of a network 100 that are responsible for facilitating<br>
wireless communication between a WCD 102 and the network 100. The BS 104<br>
establishes service areas in the vicinity of the BS 104 to support wireless mobile<br>
communication, as is known in the art. In the case of a wireless local area network<br>
(WLAN) using, for example, WiMAX or WiFi, the BSs are called Access Points<br>
(AP).<br>
[0036] Each BS 104 contains transceiver equipment, including a transmitter and a<br>
receiver coupled to an antenna 106, for transmitting and receiving radio signals and is<br>
responsible for providing service to an area commonly referred to as a "cell". In the<br>
exemplary network 100, the first BS 104 provides service to a first cell 108.<br>
[0037] The network 100 also as at least one other BS 110 that serves a geographic<br>
area, or cell, 112 that is different from the area served by the first BS 104. Therefore,<br>
when a WCD 102 is in the first cell 108, it will receive service from the first BS 104.<br>
Likewise, when the WCD 102 is in the second cell 112, it will receive service from<br>
the second BS 110.<br>
[0038] Most coverage areas are set up so that a WCD 102 is able to receive service<br>
from one BS and, prior to leaving the cell serviced by that BS, establish a connection<br>
to a second BS. In other words, most networks 100 are set up so that their cell<br>
coverages overlap. This overlap 112 is shown in FIG. 1 between the cells 108 and<br>
112.<br>
[0039] In telecommunications, a diversity scheme refers to a method for improving<br>
the reliability of a signal by utilizing two or more communication channels with<br>
different characteristics. Diversity is based on the fact that individual channels<br>
experience different levels of fading and interference and plays an important role in<br>
combating fading and co-channel interference and avoiding error bursts. Multiple<br>
versions of the same signal may be transmitted and/or received and combined in the<br>
receiver. If the antennas are at far distance, for example at different cellular base<br>
station sites or WLAN access points, this is called macrodiversity.<br><br><br>
[0040] Referring to the network of FIG. 1, the WCD 102 can receive macrodiversity<br>
signals from both the first BS 104 and the second BS 110 or diversity signals from<br>
any other BS in the system 100. Embodiments of the present invention provide, in<br>
conditions where the transmitter is not in use, diverting the transmitter LO to one of<br>
the receivers, automatically switching from MIMO operation, which is<br>
communication with a single BS 104, to utilizing each receiver independently so that<br>
each is able to communicate with a separate BS 104 (or separate access point when in<br>
WLAN coverage). The use of the at least two MIMO receivers, in a multi-link<br>
configuration, where the WCD 102 is maintaining multiple links to distinct AF7BS<br>
simultaneously is referred to herein as a MIMO/SISO (Single-Input, Single-Output)<br>
mode.<br>
[0041] Mobile Transmitter<br>
[0042] FIG. 2 shows a block diagram of a WCD 102 having a diversity transceiver<br>
200 according to exemplary embodiments of the present invention. The diversity<br>
transceiver 200 has a transmitter 201 with a transmitting antenna 203. The transceiver<br>
200 also has a first receiver 202 with a corresponding first antenna 204 and a second<br>
receiver 206 with a corresponding second antenna 208. As will be shown in the<br>
schematic diagram of FIG. 4, the receiving antennas 204, 208 of the diversity receiver<br>
200 can be decorrelated. The WCD 102 in one embodiment is a Code Division<br>
Multiple Access (CDMA) cellular telephone. Alternate WCDs, such as cellular<br>
modems, personal digital assistants (PDAs) with wireless interfaces, pagers, and other<br>
devices can be substituted for the cellular telephone shown. Additionally, ottier radio<br>
access technologies such as GSM, GPRS, UMTS, WiMAX, and LTE, can be<br>
substituted for CDMA in the WCD 102. The WCD 102 includes baseband circuitry<br>
210, a microprocessor 212, a controller 214, and a user interface 216 that includes<br>
components such as a keypad, a display, a loudspeaker, and a microphone.<br>
[0043] Additionally, the WCD 102 includes a memory block 218. The memory<br>
block 218 can be implemented as a memory that is not intended to be removed from<br>
the WCD 102, as a User Interface Module (UIM), as a Removable User Interface<br>
Module (RUIM), or as another type of memory unit. The memory block 218 includes<br><br><br>
an enhanced preferred roaming list (PRL) 224. The enhanced PRL 224 includes at<br>
least one mobile country code (MCC) with or without an optional Mobile Network<br>
Code (MNC or IMSI_11	12). The enhanced PRL 224 may also include a system<br>
identifier (SID) with or without an optional network identifier (NID). These codes are<br>
referred to as MCC/MNCs and SID/NIDs.<br>
[0044] Other memory in the memory block 218 can include random access memory<br>
(RAM) 220 and read-only memory (ROM) 222. The receivers 202, 206, when in the<br>
non-diversity mode, can employ communication at different frequencies and/or<br>
different protocols.<br>
[0045] WCD Transceiver<br>
[0046] FIG. 3 shows a schematic view of a prior-art transceiver 300. The prior-art<br>
transceiver 300 includes a transmitter 302, a first receiver 304, and a second receiver<br>
306. The transmitter 302 has a transmit antenna 308. The antenna 308 is an<br>
impedance-matching device used radiate electromagnetic waves. The function of the<br>
antenna 308 is to "match" the impedance of the propagating medium, which is usually<br>
air or free space, to the source, the WCD 102. Accordingly, the transmit antenna 308,<br>
upon receiving signals from a pair of mixers 310 and 312, launches the signals into<br>
the air. The mixers 310 and 312 are each driven by a single LO 316 and are 90<br>
degrees out of phase from one another.<br>
[0047] The prior-art transceiver 300 also includes a first receive antenna 318<br>
coupled to first 320 and second 322 mixers of the first receiver 304 and a second<br>
receiver antenna 324 coupled to first 326 and second 328 mixers of the second<br>
receiver 306. The receivers 304 and 306 are driven from a single LO 330. The output<br>
of the single LO 330 is fed to a pair of 90 degree hybrids 332 and 334. Hybrid 332<br>
drives mixer 320 and mixer 322 ninety degrees out of phase from one another and<br>
hybrid 334 drives mixer 326 and mixer 328 ninety degrees out of phase from one<br>
another.<br>
[0048] Because both receivers are driven from the same LO 326, both receivers<br>
operate at the same frequency. This sharing of the LO 326 means that the receivers<br><br><br>
cannot be used to tune to different frequencies, bands, or bandwidths. In other words,<br>
the prior-art configuration fails to exploit the macro-diversity of a multiple-receiver<br>
device in a multi-Access Point (AP)/Base Station (BS) context.<br>
[0049] MIMO transmissions, e.g., based on Space-Time codes as defined in the<br>
802.1 In standard, require longer physical layer preambles in order to enable the<br>
receiver to estimate the channel impulse responses between each of the<br>
transmit/receive antennas. The corresponding overhead can be important, in<br>
particular for communications of small data packages, such as those that occur in the<br>
context of Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) communications.<br>
[0050] If the objective is to transmit a given data package at a minimum level of<br>
emission energy, it is expected that in the VoIP case it is often better to use SISO<br>
(Single Input Single Output) modes at a higher emission power, such that the global<br>
emission energy is identical to the MIMO case, i.e., from a power-budget point of<br>
view, the MIMO transmission is not always the best choice.<br>
[0051] In particular, for VoIP calls, the MIMO radio systems proposed in many<br>
modern standards are not adapted to the user's needs. Calibrating the channel in a<br>
MIMO system requires preambles that are longer than in mono-antenna systems.<br>
When the payload of the data packet to be transmitted is small, the preamble itself<br>
dominants the on-air activity. In that case, it is better to use a mono-antenna mode<br>
with a short preamble at a lower data rate than to use an advanced high data rate<br>
MIMO mode — because the on-air time will be shorter. This is a case that arises in<br>
the use of VoIP on MIMO systems.<br>
[0052] In a mobility context where the user and/or environment are moving, abrupt<br>
shadowing effects are common, e.g., when device moves around a corner or cars<br>
move around device. This often leads to repeated interruptions in communication.<br>
However, users demand mobile voice communication hardware and techniques that<br>
will provide seamless handovers when one link breaks. The capability to use both<br>
receivers independently without the addition of a dedicated receive LO would be<br>
beneficial.<br><br><br>
[0053] WCD Transceiver Sharing TX 1,0<br>
[0054] FIG. 4 shows a schematic diagram of an exemplary embodiment of the<br>
presently inventive transceiver 400. The schematic view shows the presence of a<br>
transmitter 201 for transmitting signals to nearby BSs/APs and a first receiver 202 and<br>
second receiver 206 for MIMO diversity reception and MIMO/SISO independent<br>
operation. Similar to the transceiver 302 shown in FIG. 3, transceiver 400 includes a<br>
transmit antenna 203 coupled to the transmitter 201. The transmit antenna 203<br>
receives signals from a pair of mixers 410, 412 and radiates electromagnetic waves<br>
into the air. The mixers 410, 412 are each driven by a single LO 416 and are ninety<br>
degrees out of phase from one another.<br>
[0055] The transceiver 400 also includes a first receive antenna 204 coupled to first<br>
420 and second 422 mixers of the first receiver 202 and a second receiver antenna 208<br>
coupled to first 426 and second 428 mixers of the second receiver 206. The receivers<br>
202, 206 are driven from a single LO 430. The output of the single LO 430 is fed to a<br>
pair of ninety degree hybrids 432 and 434. Hybrid 432 drives mixer 420 and mixer<br>
422 ninety degrees out of phase from one another and hybrid 434 drives mixer 426<br>
and mixer 428 ninety degrees out of phase from one another.<br>
[0056] The inventive transceiver 400 advantageously also includes a conductive<br>
signal path 436 that, during times of transmitter 201 non-use, couples the transmitter<br>
LO 416 directly to the second receiver 206, while at the same time, decouples the<br>
receiver LO 430 from the second receiver 206. The transceiver 400, thereby provides<br>
each receiver 202, 206 with its own LO and allows each receiver to engage in<br>
independent operation.<br>
[0057] More specifically, the signal path 436 has a first switch 438 located between<br>
the transmit LO 416 of the transmitter 201 and the second receiver 206. When the<br>
switch 438 is in a closed position, as shown in FIG. 4, a communication path is<br>
created from the transmit LO 416 of the transmitter 201 directly to the 90 degree<br>
hybrid 434 of the second receiver 206. Alternatively, when the switch 438 is in the<br>
open position, the transmit LO 416 of the transmitter 201 is applied directly to the 90<br><br><br>
degree hybrid 431 of the transmitter 201. Of course, in other circuit arrangements, the<br>
first switch 438 could operate in reverse states as that described here.<br>
[0058] The signal path 436 also includes a second switch 440. The second switch 440<br>
of the signal path 436, when in an open position, as shown in FIG. 4, disconnects the<br>
transmit LO 416 from the second receiver 206, while keeping it connected to the first<br>
receiver 202. The second switch 440 provides the first receiver 202 with its own<br>
oscillator, thereby allowing the first receiver 202 to be tuned to a different frequency,<br>
frequency band, or bandwidths as the second receiver 206, which is driven by LO 416.<br>
In other words, circuit configuration 400 of FIG. 4 advantageously exploits the macro-<br>
diversity of the multiple-receiver device in a multi-Access Point (AP)/Base Station<br>
(BS) context by providing two independent receivers. The first switch 438 and<br>
second switch 440 form a switching assembly. Of course, in other circuit<br>
configurations, the second switch 440 could operate in reverse states as that described<br>
here. In still other circuit configurations, the first 438 and second 440 switches can be<br>
embodied in a single switch that, upon switch operation, opens an electrical path<br>
between the receive LO 430 and the second receiver 206 and closes a path between<br>
the transmit LO 416 and the second receiver 206 and vice-versa. The first 438 and<br>
second 440 switches can also be embodied in more than two switches.<br>
[0059] The circuit of FIG. 4 can be used for any low-rate application, such as VoIP,<br>
where the overhead for the MIMO preamble required for the channel estimation<br>
outweighs the data that needs to be sent for the application. More specifically, the<br>
second receiver 206, enabled by the transmit LO 416 can be used to scan frequencies<br>
for new access points/BSs to switch to, then to associate with the new access<br>
point/BS, and to be ready to act as the primary connection for the VoIP link when the<br>
primary system goes down or out of range.<br>
[0060] By advantageously utilizing the transmit LO 416, the present invention<br>
avoids the addition of a second receive LO. This use of the transmit LO is a great<br>
benefit from a complexity and cost standpoint.<br>
[0061] FIG. 5 shows a process flowchart 500 for using transceiver 200 of WCD 102<br>
of FIG. 1, according to an embodiment of the present invention. This process 500 can<br><br><br>
be implemented using software in the microprocessor 212 of the transceiver 200<br>
shown in FIG. 2. This embodiment shows two CDMA receivers; however, these<br>
teachings can be expanded to use more than two receivers as well as reception<br>
technology other than CDMA.<br>
[0062] The flowchart 500 starts at step 502 in a first switching state where the first<br>
switch 438 of the conductive path 436 is open and the second switch 440 is closed.<br>
The open first switch 438 opens the conductive path from the transmit LO 416 to the<br>
second receiver 206 and decouples the transmit LO 416 from the second receiver 206.<br>
The closed second switch 440 couples the receive LO 430 to the second receiver 206.<br>
The two receivers 202, 206 are now correlated and will operate at the same frequency.<br>
[0063] Step 504 determines if the WCD 102 is in a mode that does not immediately<br>
require use of the transmitter 201. Examples of situations where the LO 416 of the<br>
transmitter 201 can be used to operate one of the receivers independent of the other<br>
receiver and the dedicated channel reception is not degraded includes initial cell<br>
search, neighbor cell search during idle mode, idle slots/frames, or compressed mode<br>
gaps, Idle mode, neighbor cell monitoring gaps in traffic mode, traffic mode with<br>
service reception, Idle mode camped situations, foreground scanning mode situations,<br>
Multimedia Broadcast Multicast Service (MBMS), and others. If step 504 determines<br>
that use of the transmitter 201 is needed, the flow returns to step 504 until the<br>
outcome of step 504 changes.<br>
[0064] However, even though the WCD 102 can operate in a mode that does not<br>
require immediate use of the transmitter, coverage should be sufficient so that at least<br>
one of the two receivers operating independently is able to receive a reliable signal.<br>
Therefore, step 506 determines if the WCD 102 is experiencing poor coverage. The<br>
poor coverage determination step 506 will be expanded with respect to FIG. 6.<br>
[0065] If the WCD 102 is not experiencing poor coverage, in step 508, a second<br>
switching state is entered where the first switch 438 couples the transmit LO 416 to<br>
the second receiver 206 and the second switch 440 decouples the receive LO 430 from<br>
the second receiver 206. Each transmitter 202, 206 can now be used to locate<br>
available cell service. In step 510, the WDC 102 uses the second receiver 206 for<br><br><br>
either foreground or background scanning, depending on the mode of the WCD 102.<br>
It is noted that the "second receiver" is simply any receiver other than the first<br>
receiver. Thus, if the WCD 102 is in good coverage, both receivers 202, 206 will<br>
independently scan channels to find service, getting through the list as quickly as<br>
possible.<br>
[0066] If the WCD 102 is experiencing poor coverage, as determined in step 506,<br>
step 512 places, or ensures that, the WCD 102 is in a dual-receiver mode as described<br>
in connection with step 502. Step 514 uses the second receiver 206 for diversity to<br>
maximize the ability of the WCD 102 to pull in marginal signals. Of course, the first<br>
receiver 202 is also needed for diversity reception.<br>
[0067] Periodically, step 510 and step 514 return to step 504 to re-evaluate the<br>
mode and coverage situation of the WCD 102. Because the WCD 102 may be<br>
changing communication mode or status and also may be changing geographic<br>
locations, the network may be experiencing different loading conditions, and/or the<br>
environment of the WCD 102 may be variable. Periodic mode and coverage re-<br>
determination allow the process 500 to deploy me second receiver 206 more<br>
efficiently for either diversity reception to improve coverage or for scanning to reduce<br>
current drain. It is noted that the periodicity of the coverage re-determination can vary<br>
depending on, for example, a trigger (e.g., in step 510 the second receiver has<br>
completed scanning of a predetermined number of channels), an elapsed time period<br>
that can depend on what mode the WCD 102 is in (e.g., idle mode or traffic mode), or<br>
the "poorness" of the coverage. The mode re-determination can be stimulated by the<br>
processor 212 recognizing a mode change.<br>
[0068] FIG. 6 shows a flowchart 506 for determining poor coverage according to<br>
one embodiment of the present invention. Step 602 starts the poor coverage<br>
determination. Step 604 uses one receiver (such as the first receiver 202 shown in<br>
FIGs. 2 &amp; 4), and step 606 collects statistics S1 using the one receiver over a first<br>
predetermined time period T1. Depending on the implementation, the statistics S1 can<br>
be packet erasure rate, frame erasure rate, bit error rate, the average power of a carrier<br>
channel over total signal power (Ec/Io), energy per bit over noise (EB/N0), received<br><br><br>
signal strength indication (RSSI), other statistics, the rate of change of one or more of<br>
the statistics, or a combination of statistics.<br>
[0069] After statistics S1 are collected, step 608 uses two receivers (such as the first<br>
receiver 202 and second receiver 206 shown in FIGs. 2 &amp; 4) and step 610 collects<br>
statistics S2 using both receivers over a second predetermined time period T2. The<br>
statistics S2 should be the same type of statistics as statistics S1 so that they can be<br>
compared. The second predetermined time period T2 can be equal to or different<br>
from the first predetermined time period T1.<br>
[0070] Step 612 compares the two statistics S1 and S2. If statistics S2 is<br>
significantly larger than statistics S1, step 616 determines that the WCD 102 is<br>
experiencing poor coverage. If statistics S2 is not significantly larger than statistics<br>
S1, step 614 determines that the WCD 102 is experiencing acceptable (i.e., not poor)<br>
coverage. The determination of "significantly larger" can be implemented using<br>
absolute numbers (e.g., S1 is less than a predetermined value and S2 is greater than a<br>
predetermined value), arithmetic ratios (e.g., S2 is more than three times S1),<br>
logarithmic ratios, or other comparisons depending on the type of statistics collected<br>
as well as the sensitivity and power efficiency of the multiple receivers.<br>
[0071] FIG. 7 shows a process flow where one of the WCD 102 modes determined<br>
in step 504 of FIG. 5 is an idle mode. During idle mode, the WCD 102 is not in a call,<br>
so the transmitter 201 is not in use. In this mode, the WCD 102 monitors various<br>
control channels of a system. In step 702 the WCD 102 is in the idle mode with a first<br>
receiver (such as receiver 202 in FIGs. 2 &amp; 4) monitoring control channels of a<br>
system. Step 704 determines the coverage quality the WCD 102 is experiencing.<br>
Step 704 can be implemented using the flow chart 506 shown in FIG. 6.<br>
[0072] If the WCD 102 is experiencing adequate coverage, in step 706, the first<br>
switch 438 couples the transmit LO 416 to the second receiver 206 and the second<br>
switch 440 decouples the receive LO 430 from the second receiver 206. Each<br>
transmitter 202, 206 can now be used independently. Step 708 then uses the second<br>
receiver for background scanning while the first receiver continues to monitor the<br>
appropriate control channels.<br><br><br>
[0073] If step 704 determines that the WCD 102 is experiencing poor coverage, in<br>
step 710, the first switch 438 decouples the transmit LO 416 from the second receiver<br>
206 and the second switch 440 couples the receive LO 430 to the second receiver 206.<br>
The transmitters 202, 206 are now driven by the same LO 430. Step 712 uses the first<br>
and second receivers (such as receivers 202 and 206 in FIGs. 2 &amp; 4) for diversity<br>
reception.<br>
[0074] Step 708 and step 712 flow back to step 704 periodically to re-determine the<br>
coverage situation. Returning to step 704 may be caused by changes in channel<br>
statistics (such as RSSI), paging message errors, or a timer.<br>
[0075] FIG. 8 shows a process flow 800 where one of the WCD 102 modes<br>
determined in step 504 of FIG. 5 is a traffic mode. During traffic mode, a first<br>
receiver (such as receiver 202 in FIGs. 2 &amp; 4) is in a call and is tuned to a specific<br>
traffic channel and is receiving or expecting to receive signals. Step 802 has the<br>
WCD 102 in traffic mode with a first receiver tuned to a traffic channel. Step 804<br>
determines if the WCD 102 is experiencing poor coverage. Step 802 can be<br>
implemented using the flow chart 506 shown in FIG. 6.<br>
[0076] If the WCD 102 is experiencing poor coverage, in step 806, the first switch<br>
438 decouples the transmit LO 416 from the second receiver 206 and the second<br>
switch 440 couples the receive LO 430 to the second receiver 206. The transmitters<br>
202, 206 are now driven by the same LO 430. Step 808 uses the second receiver 206<br>
for diversity reception on the traffic channel. Of course, the first receiver is also used<br>
for diversity.<br>
[0077] If the WCD 102 is not experiencing poor coverage, in step 810, the first<br>
switch 438 couples the transmit LO 416 to the second receiver 206 and the second<br>
switch 440 decouples the receive LO 430 from the second receiver 206. Each<br>
transmitter 202, 206 can now be used independently. Step 812 then uses the second<br>
receiver for background scanning while the first receiver is timed to the traffic<br>
channel. If background scanning is not necessary the second receiver may be powered<br>
down to save power.<br><br><br>
[0078] Step 808 and step 812 flow back to step 804 periodically to re-determine the<br>
coverage situation. Returning to step 804 may be caused by changes in channel<br>
statistics (such as RSSI), paging message errors, or a timer.<br>
[0079] FIG. 9 shows a flowchart 900 for using the transceiver 400 of FIG. 4<br>
according to an embodiment of the present invention. The flow of FIG. 9 is tailored<br>
to a WCD 102 in an initial cell foreground scanning mode. In this mode, none of the<br>
receivers of the WCD 102 are in either idle mode or traffic mode. Generally,<br>
foreground scanning mode occurs when the WCD 102 is powered on or the WCD 102<br>
has encountered a situation where no signals can be located and thus cannot camp on<br>
a system in idle mode.<br>
[0080] The flow starts at step 902 and moves directly to step 904 where the WCD<br>
102 enters the foreground-scanning mode. This typically occurs when the unit is<br>
powered on and needs to find service. In step 906, the WCD 102 generates a scan list<br>
for finding service. In step 908, the first switch 438 couples the transmit LO 416 to<br>
the second receiver 206 and the second switch 440 decouples the receive LO 430 from<br>
the second receiver 206. Each transmitter 202, 206 can now be used to locate<br>
available cell service.<br>
[0081 ] In step 910, the first receiver 202 of the WCD 102 scans a first channel on<br>
the list. If a channel is acquired, as determined by step 912, the WCD 102 in step 914<br>
will determine if it is allowed to camp on the channel. If the WCD 102 is allowed to<br>
camp on the recently acquired channel, then step 916 switches the WCD 102 to idle<br>
mode and foreground scanning ends. If step 914 determines that the WCD 102 is not<br>
allowed to camp on the newly acquired channel, then the flow continues to step 918,<br>
and the WCD 102 marks the channel as scanned and not allowed. In step 920, the<br>
WCD 102 determines if other channels remain to be scanned on the list.<br>
[0082] If step 912 determines that the scanned channel cannot be acquired, then step<br>
922 marks the channel as a diversity scanning candidate, and the WCD 102 will go to<br>
step 920. If channels remain to be scanned, then the flow returns to step 910. At this<br>
time, whichever receiver 202, 206 is free will scan the next channel on the list. Thus,<br><br><br>
the WCD 102 will have both receivers independently scanning channels from the scan<br>
list searching for a system to camp on.<br>
[0083] Once all the channels on the scan list have been scanned using a single<br>
receiver at a time, the flow continues to step 922 where the first switch 438 decouples<br>
the transmit LO 416 from the second receiver 202 and the second switch 440 couples<br>
the receive LO 430 to the second receiver 202. The two receivers 202, 206 are now<br>
correlated and will operate at the same frequency.<br>
[0084] Now that the two receivers are again sharing the receive LO 430, in step 924,<br>
the WCD 102 uses diversity to scan any diversity channel candidates marked back at<br>
step 922. While not shown, it is noted that, if there are no diversity channel<br>
candidates, the flow will jump to step 930. If at least one channel was marked for<br>
diversity scanning, then step 924 will use both receivers 202, 206 to scan a channel<br>
from the diversity candidate list. Step 926 determines if a channel was acquired. If a<br>
channel is not acquired, the flow continues to step 928 to determine if another<br>
diversity candidate channel is available on the list for a diversity scan. If another<br>
diversity candidate channel exists, the flow continues to step 924 and the next<br>
diversity candidate channel on the list is scanned.<br>
[0085] If a channel is acquired at step 926, then the WCD 102 determines if it may<br>
camp on the channel in step 932. If the WCD 102 can camp on that channel, then<br>
flow continues to step 934, where the WCD 102 camps on the channel and switches to<br>
idle mode. If the WCD 102 is not allowed to camp on the channel, then flow goes to<br>
step 928.<br>
[0086] At step 930, all channels have been scanned with a single receiver or MIMO<br>
diversity and no service has been found. At this point, depending on the rules<br>
governing system selection of the WCD 102, the unit may build a new scan list and<br>
start the process over from step 906 or it may wait for a period of time before re-<br>
attempting to find service.<br>
[0087] Thus, the inventive WCD 102 uses the transmitter LO 416 during transmitter<br>
downtime to drive, in combination with the receive LO 440, the two receivers 202,<br><br><br>
206 independently to scan a list to find service as quickly as possible and then re-scan<br>
channels that were not originally found using diversity to maximize the ability to<br>
receive a signal. Other methods of interleaving simplex and diversity scanning can be<br>
used.<br>
[0088] The initial cell search, as described above with reference to FIG. 9<br>
potentially speeds up initial cell synchronization and reduces the time required to<br>
camp on a channel. Use of the independent receivers 202, 206 before frame<br>
synchronization per base station is advantageous because, typically, the benefit of<br>
diversity prior to synchronization is limited and correlation of signals from both<br>
antennas 204, 208 would not be expected. With limited benefit for diversity, using<br>
receivers independently should speed up search of different frequency bands and/or<br>
RATS (first order estimate of 2x). The present invention also can be used as an<br>
enabler for replacement of me currently-used temperature compensated crystal<br>
oscillators with a less expensive and larger frequency tolerance crystal. In one<br>
embodiment, this is performed by using both receivers 202, 206 at different frequency<br>
offsets to more effectively cover the tolerance of the reference oscillator.<br>
[0089] Embodiments of the present invention are advantageously used for MBMS<br>
modes, where strong signals, such that diversity, are not needed. In these modes,<br>
uplink during MBMS reception is limited and the transmit LO 416 could be used for<br>
the second receive LO for a large portion of time. The second receiver 202 could be<br>
used for monitoring other MBMS or unicast cells.<br>
[0090] FIG. 10 shows an algorithm used to determine when to change between<br>
MIMO and MIMO/SISO modes according to an exemplary embodiment of the<br>
present invention. In this embodiment, the algorithm is based upon the needs of the<br>
applications currently supported by the WCD 102. In one exemplary embodiment of<br>
the present invention, the change/transfer is performed in the protocol stack connected<br>
to the MIMO and MIMO/SISO systems. This protocol stack might perform the<br>
bundling of the systems in a multi-homed manner, like in a Stream Control<br>
Transmission Protocol (SCTP) or there might be separate protocol stacks for each<br><br><br>
system. As shown in the process flow diagrams of FIGs. 5 and 6, the algorithms will<br>
be slightly different in both cases.<br>
[0091] If the application sees a single protocol stack grouped together by an SCTP<br>
protocol, then the situation is transparent for the application, and the process to split<br>
the MIMO system into a multiple-link MIMO/SISO systems or regroup the<br>
MIMO/SISO systems into a single MIMO system can be made entirely in the protocol<br>
stack.<br>
[0092] Referring now to FIG. 10, an example of the presently inventive process is<br>
illustrated and starts at step 1000 with the system in a MIMO/SISO configuration.<br>
The flow moves directly to step 1002, where the WCD 102 averages the instantaneous<br>
data rate requirements in a moving average with a fixed window time. This step<br>
smoothes any peaks in the data rate. The window size might be, for example, 100ms<br>
to Is.<br>
[0093] Step 1004 determines whether the windowed data-rate requirement (both<br>
uplink and downlink) is larger than a limit Rupper. If the answer is yes, then, in step<br>
1006, the MIMO/SISO systems are regrouped into a single MIMO system, and in step<br>
1008, the defunct interfaces are removed from the SCTP bundle. The flow then<br>
returns to step 1002.<br>
[0094] If, however, the windowed data rate requirement (both uplink and downlink)<br>
is not larger than Rupper, step 1010 determines whether the windowed data-rate<br>
requirement is smaller than a limit Rlower, which will be smaller than Rupper. The<br>
distance between Rlower and Rupper prevents the device from rapidly switching between<br>
modes. If the answer to step 1010 is yes, then, in step 1012, the MIMO system<br>
remains, or is split into, the multiple MIMO/SISO configuration. In step 1014, the<br>
SCTP protocol will be used to add the new interfaces into the bundle and flow moves<br>
back up to step 1002.<br>
[0095] If the new interfaces are presented as separate interfaces to the application,<br>
then the application itself will be required to make use of multiple interfaces and to be<br>
capable of reacting to a change in the network routing and multi-homing. The<br><br><br>
algorithm to determine whether to use MIMO or multiple MIMO/SISO systems,<br>
however, must still be determined within the protocol stacks themselves, as the<br>
decision is based on the total data rate requirement, and not the requirement of a<br>
single application. The process would, then, be that shown in FIG. 11.<br>
[0096] The flow of FIG. 11 begins at step 1100 with the system in a MIMO/SISO<br>
configuration and moves directly to step 1102, where the WCD 102 averages the<br>
instantaneous data rate requirements in a moving average with a window time that is<br>
fixed. This step smoothes any peaks in the data rate. The window size might be<br>
100ms to 1s, for example. This step can be performed by regrouping the data rate<br>
requirements of the MIMO/SISO interfaces into a single figure of merit.<br>
[0097] Step 1104 determines whether the windowed data-rate requirement (both<br>
uplink and downlink) is larger than a limit Rupper. If the answer is yes, then, in step<br>
1106, the MIMO/SISO systems are regrouped into a single MIMO system. In step<br>
1108, the defunct interfaces are disabled in the kernel and, in step 1110, the<br>
application observes mat the defunct interfaces no long exist and regroups its traffic<br>
over the remaining MIMO interface. The flow then returns to step 1102.<br>
[0098] Alternatively, if the answer to step 1104 is no, the flow moves to step 1111,<br>
where it is determined whether the windowed data rate requirement (both uplink and<br>
downlink) is smaller than a limit Rlowers, which will be smaller than Rupper. If the answer<br>
is no, then the flow moves back to step 1102. However, if the answer to step 1111 is<br>
yes, then flow moves to step 1112 and the unit remains, or is switched into, the<br>
MIMO/SISO configuration. The application then observes, in step 1114, that new<br>
network interfaces have appeared that might be used and reconfigures itself to routing<br>
its traffic over all of the interfaces.<br>
[0099] In an IEEE 802.11 n CSMA scheme, the mode used by the WCD 102 is<br>
chosen by the WCD 102 and can be changed on a packet-by-packet basis. Therefore,<br>
there will be no loss in the uplink from the terminal if an appropriate modulation is<br>
chosen from the MIMO/SISO mode. The downlink modulation might cause a<br>
problem if the mode change happens between the time the access point chooses its<br>
modulation based on channel and Received Signal Strength Indication (RSSI)<br><br><br>
measurements and the time the downlink packet is sent. For a VoIP application, a<br>
packet is sent every 20ms, so there is a large amount of time to re-measure the<br>
downlink channel if the terminal changes its mode soon after reception of a VoIP<br>
packet.<br>
[00100] For an IEEE 802.16 system, the terminal can only change its mode by<br>
requesting a new resource allocation. This happens in the contention slot at the end of<br>
the 802.16 frame, which is typically 5 ms long. Therefore, in the worst case, there is<br>
at least 10ms of margin to allow the change to happen in the uplink/downlink<br>
modulation to ensure that no packets are lost. Other low-rate applications with a<br>
reasonable latency between packets to be sent (which is typically all low rate<br>
applications) can also be applied.<br>
[00101] Conclusion<br>
[00102] Embodiments of the present invention have just been described that<br>
advantageously enable a transmitter LO to be shifted to a second receiver in a multi-<br>
receiver device during times of transmitter non-use. Diverting the transmitter LO to<br>
the second receiver efficiently switches the device between a MIMO mode (operating<br>
at a single carrier frequency) and Multi-Link modes with distinct links (operating at<br>
distinct carrier frequencies). The choice between MIMO and MIMO/SISO modes is<br>
based upon the required data rate of the application and the associated MIMO channel<br>
estimation overhead. In a low data-rate condition, the inventive communication<br>
scheme allows redundant data to be sent on the multiple links, i.e., separate MIMO<br>
channels, providing a redundant link that can be used to ensure continuity of the<br>
communication in the event of a link loss on one channel. Depending on the context<br>
of the user, it is then possible to choose between the following two classes of<br>
operational modes:<br>
1. MIMO link to a single AP/BS — this is expected to be preferred in a static<br>
context where a sudden interruption and/or degradation of the links is<br>
unlikely; and<br><br><br>
2. MIMI/SISO multi-link configuration — where the WCD is maintaining<br>
multiple links to distinct AP/BS simultaneously. The inherent macro-<br>
diversity is expected to be of advantage in a mobility scenario where a<br>
sudden interruption/degradation of a link may occur. In a practical context,<br>
it is expected that a WCD supports two to three antennas.<br>
