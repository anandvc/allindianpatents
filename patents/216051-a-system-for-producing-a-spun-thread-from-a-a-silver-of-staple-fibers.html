BACKGROUND AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
An arrangement for producing a spun thread<br>
The present invention relates to an arrangement for producing a spun thread from a<br>
silver of staple fibres, compiling a drafting unit having a plurality of roller pairs for<br>
drafting the sliver to a fibre strand of predeterminable fineness, comprising an airjet<br>
aggregate arranged downstream of the drafting unit, said airjet aggregate comprising<br>
an entry opening for the fibre strand and also comprising a traversing device for<br>
traversing a sliver-guiding component across the width of the roller pairs of the<br>
drafting unit, without bringing the fibre strand out of alignment transversely to the<br>
entry opening of the airjet aggregate.<br>
An arrangement of this type is prior art in German published patent 31 45 208. In<br>
this known arrangement, the silver-guiding component is a bottom apron, which itself<br>
cames out a traversing motion, possibly alternating with the top apron arranged<br>
thereto. The traverse speed of the known arrangement should be sufficiently slow<br>
that the deviations of the fibre strand from the normal running path are kept as low as<br>
possible, and in particular that no meandering running path of the fibre strand occurs,<br>
so that the centre of the fibre strand released from the last roller pair of the drafting<br>
unit does not get out of alignment transversely to the entry opening of the airjet<br>
aggregate.<br>
The last mentioned requirement succeeds only partially, in particular then when<br>
airjet aggregates are applied, whose delivery speeds measure up to 600 m per<br>
minute. Also in the case of the Known arrangement, only the lifetime of the running<br>
aprons is extended, while the wear on the cots of the drafting unit is net reduced<br>
It is an object of the present invention to ensure on the one hand that the fibres<br>
always enter into the entry opening in the same way even at high delivery speeds,<br>
and on the other hand to extend the lifetime of the cots and also of the running<br>
aprons of the drafting unit.<br>
This object has been achieved in that the traversing device is connected with at least<br>
one condenser which determines the width of the fibre strand and which is assigned<br>
to a roller pair of the  drafting unit said traversing device also being connected with<br>
the airjet aggregate via a drive mechanism.<br><br>
3<br>
With the application of the features of the present invention, the feeding or the fibres<br>
into the airjet aggregate is ensured because the airjet aggregate traverses with the<br>
fibre strand. At the same time the wear on the cots as well as on the running aprons<br>
is reduces, in particular when the traverse motion is carried out very slowly and the<br>
entire width of the cots is utilized. As according to the present invention the<br>
condensers traverse in a known way and form the silver-guiding component,<br>
traversing devices can in principle, be applied which have been proven in practical<br>
usage, for example the traversing of a feeding condenser and an intermediate<br>
condenser. These condensers are each arranged upstream of the relevant roller pair,<br>
whereby usually a condenser is not assigned to the front roller pair.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the present invention the at least one condenser and<br>
the airjet aggregate are arranged to a joint supporting element.   A thread cleaner can<br>
be additionally arranged downstream of the airjet aggregate on this supporting<br>
element.  The thread withdrawn out of the airjet aggregate is hereby also traversed<br>
so that wear on the withdrawal roller pairs is also reduced.<br>
The traversing device itself can be designed in various ways<br>
In one embodiment it is provided that the traversing device comprises a traversing<br>
rod which extends along the length of the machine and is assigned to a plurality of<br>
spinning positions. As, in order to avoid faulty drafting, the roller pairs of the drafting<br>
unit are brought to a standstill in the case of an end break, the traverse motion must<br>
also be discontinued in such a case. In the case of a traversing rod which extends<br>
along a plurality of spinning positions, the traverse motion at one individual spinning<br>
position must be able to be decoupled from the general traverse motion when this is<br>
required. This can be achieved by a mechanism which hooks onto the traversing rod<br>
after the spinning position has been set in operation again.<br>
In the case of another embodiment it is provided that each spinning position has its<br>
own traversing device assigned thereto, which is connected via a drive mechanism<br>
with the front roller pair of the drafting unit.   In the event of an end break, the drafting<br>
unit must also be stopped. However when the drafting unit is brought to a standstill,<br>
the traversing motion is also stopped because of the drive related coupling of the<br>
traversing device with the front roller pair of the drafting unit.<br><br>

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
These and further objects, features and advantages of the present invention will<br>
become more readily apparent from the following detailed description thereof when<br>
taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings wherein:<br>
Figure 1 is a side view of an arrangement according to the present invention.<br>
Figure 2 is a view in the direction of the arrow II of Figure 1.<br>
The arrangement as shown in Figures 1 and 2 serve to produce a spun thread 1 from<br>
a silver of staple fibres or from a roving 2. The arrangement comprises a drafting unit<br>
3 as well as an airjet aggregate 4 as essential components.<br>
The sliver 2 to be spun is fed to the drafting unit 3 in feed direction A and is<br>
withdrawn as a spun thread 1 in withdrawal direction B to a winding device (not<br>
shown). A withdrawal roller pair 5.6 serves the withdrawal of the thread 1 from the<br>
airjet aggregate 4.<br>
The drafting unit is designed as a three-line- drafting system and comprises three<br>
roller pairs 7, 8: 9, 10; 11,12 overall, which each comprise a bottom roller and an<br>
upper roller. The roller pair 7. 8 is the back roller pair, the roller pair 9, 10 is the<br>
middle roller pair provided with running aprons 13 and 14, while the roller pair 11, 12<br>
is the iron roller pair. In a drafting unit 3 of this type, the sliver or roving 2 is drafted<br>
to a desired, predeterminable fineness in the known way. Directly downstream of the<br>
drafting unit 3 a fibre strand 15 is preset, which is dratted but still not twisted.<br>
The roller speeds necessary for the drafting process are achieved in the present<br>
case by means of drive motors 16,17 and 18 to which the respective bottom rollers<br>
6,10 and 12 are connected.<br>
As is known, a feed condenser 19 for the fed staple silver or roving 2 is arranged<br>
upstream of xxx and an intermediate condenser 20 is arranged<br>
upstream of the middle roller pair 9, 10.<br>
The airjet aggregate 4, arranged at a short distance downstream of the drafting unit 3<br>
and responsible for imparting the spinning twist, can, in principle be of any type in the<br>
present invention, whereby, however, a design of the type found in the international<br>
patent application WO 02/24993 is, addressed as this type of airiet aggregate 4<br>
permits particularly high delivery speeds. The airjet aggregate 4 is therefore not<br>
described here in any detail.  It comprises in any case an entry opening 21 for the<br><br>
5<br>
fibre strand 15, company further a yarn withdrawal channel 22 for the spun thread<br>
1, that is, a xxx spinning twist and also comprising a plurality of airjet<br>
nozzles 23 which generate a vortex current in the know way which effects the<br>
impartation of the twist.<br>
A yarn monitoring device is arranged downstream of the airjet aggregate 4, which in<br>
the present case is also designed as a thread cleaner 24. Thread cleaners 24 of this<br>
type are known in prior art. The above mentioned withdrawal roller pair 5, 6 is<br>
arranged downstream of the thread cleaner 24.<br>
In airjet spinning, delivery speeds of up to 860 in per minute can be realized.   This<br>
resets in an increased wear of the cots of the top rollers 7, 9 and 11 in the drafting<br>
unit 3. as well as of the running aprons 13 and 14. In order that the running aprons<br>
13 and 14 do not have to be constantly replaced, and that the cots do not need to be<br>
re-ground at short intervals, the fibre xxx IS traversed across the width of the<br>
roller pairs 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 to the drafting unit 3, as is generally known already in<br>
prior art. It should, however, be ensured that - as aimed for in the above mentioned<br>
prior art, if only imperfectly - the fibre strand 15 is net brought out of alignment<br>
transversely to the entry opening 21 of line airjet aggregate 4. The entry opening 21<br>
of the airjet aggregate 4 must be positioned very precisely in relation to the exit of the<br>
drafting unit 3 and to the fibre strand 15 exiting out of the drafting unit 3. Even a<br>
slight displacement of the entry opening 21 in relation to the exiting fibres impairs the<br>
yarn quality and can even result in an end break. It should be ensured that, on the<br>
one hand, the fibres enter the entry opening 21 in the same way, and on the other<br>
hand, that the lifetime of the cots and of the running aprons 13 and 14 are extended.<br>
Deviating. from xxx mentioned prior a traversing device-25 is now provided<br>
which is not only connected with at least one condenser 19 or 20 which determines<br>
the width of the fibre strand 15 and has a roller pair 7, 8; 9, 10 of the drafting unit 3<br>
assigned thereto, but also with an airjet aggregate 4 via a drive mechanism. Thus a<br>
more reliable xxx entry opening 21 is ensured because the airjet<br>
aggregate 4 traverses synchronously to the fibre strand 15. At the same time, the<br>
fibre strand 15 moves slowly over the entire width of the running aprons 13 and 14<br>
and over the cots of the roller 7, 9 and 11, so that their lifetime is significantly<br>
extended.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention it is now provided that both condensers,<br>
namely the feed condenser 19 and the intermediate condenser 20 as well as the<br><br>
6<br>
airjet aggregate 4 and the thread cleaner 24 arranged downstream thereof are<br>
arranged on a joint, traversing supporting element 26   Fastening elements 27, 28, 29<br>
and 30 serve this purpose   In this way, the above mentioned advantages are<br>
achieved.<br>
The traversing device 25 can comprise a traversing rod 31 which extends along the<br>
machine and is assigned to a plurality of spinning passions, as preferably shown in<br>
the Figures.  This traversing rod 31 is moved very slowly according to the traversing<br>
directions C and D, namely over a largest possible with of the cots of the rollers 7, 9<br>
and 11 and the running aprons 13 and 14. Should an end break occur for any<br>
reason, the drafting unit 3 is stopped to avoid faulty drafting, that is, the roller pairs 7,<br>
8: 9, 10 as well as 11, 12 are brought to a standstill.  In this case, the traversing<br>
device 25 must also be brought to a standstill which occurs in the case of a central<br>
traversing rod 31 in that the relevant single spinning position is de-coupled from the<br>
general traversing motion by means of various devices (not shown)<br>
Alternatively it can be provided that the traversing device 25 extends individually over<br>
only one single spinning position.   In this case it is purposeful to late the drive of the<br>
traversing rod 31 from the drive of the back roller pair 7. 8, such a drive coupling 32<br>
being denoted in Figure 1 by a dot-dash line.  In such a case, when the back roller<br>
pair 7,8 is stopped due to an end break, the traversing device 25 is automatically<br>
stopped as well<br><br>
