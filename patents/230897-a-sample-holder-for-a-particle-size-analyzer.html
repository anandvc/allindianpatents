				<td>This inventing relates to a particle size analyzer for holding multiple sample holder.<br>
This invention particularly relates to a sample holder capable of holding a plurality of samples for use in the analysis of particle size distribution of powders by the method of sedimentation /settling of the powder particles in a viscous liquid, a process that obeys Stake's law The present invention is an improvement of the sample holder used for a method of differential turbidimetry, a device which has been described and claimed in our patent application No. 1684/DEL/98.<br>
In the above said patent application whereas a single sample holder and a glass cuvette was used containing the powder-liquid slurry, the present invention describes a sample holder which can hold more than one cuvettes containing different slurry samples for simultaneous acquisition of light signal transmitted by the cuvettes. The light signal data are converted to particle size data for analysis by software.<br>
The main objective of the present invention is to provide a device useful as a multiple sample holder for a particle size analyzer.<br>
Another objective of the present invention is to provide a device which uses a single light source and a detector for analysis of multiple samples.<br>
In the drawings accompanying this specification figures 1-4 show an embodiment of the device of the present invention.<br>
Fig 1 represents the shape of the cuvettes.<br>
Fig 2. Represents the schematic diagram of the sample holder capable of holding the<br>
cuvetts<br>
Fig 3. Represents the base unit along with the optical arrangement.<br>
Fig.4. represents the top view of the optical arrangement.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides A particle size analyzer for holding multiple sample holder, which comprises: a base plate (13) having a top plate (9) with an opening, supported by vertical elements (14), the said base plate being provided with light source (1 1) so as to direct light to the first of a series of mirrors (12) to reflecting the light beam to a centrally placed photo detector (10) and simultaneously splitting the said light beam so as to direct the said beam to the subsequent mirror(s), characterized in that the said<br>
top plate (9) provided with the opening to accommodate a sample holder essentially<br>
t&gt; kctu consisting of a split base plate (5,6) so as to accommodate the said cetral- detector (10),<br><br><br>
the said split base plate (5,6) having a top platform (1) supported on vertical elements (7), the said top platform (1) being provided with slots having the same cross section as that of cuvettes for holding samples to be analyzed, vertical partitions (8) being provided between base plate (5,6) and said top platform (1) in such a manner so as to provide light tight partition between cuvettes holding the samples, the said platform (1) being provided with a removable top cover (2,3) with known fixing means (4).<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention the light source used may be a solid state laser.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention, the mirrors used may be a thin film coated glass plate capable of directing, reflecting and splitting a light beam.<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention the mirrors may be placed at an angle of 45Â°.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, the photo detector used may be such as a silicon photovoltaic cell.<br>
The top of the holder consist of a sheet of a flexible material (2) held pressed against the top of cuvettes by a metal plate (3). A threaded bolt fixed to the center of platform (1) pass through the sheet (2) and plate (3). A wing nut secures the whole arrangement. The sample holder is designed to have a double base (5) and (6) connected to the platform by screws and four rods (7). Further four metal plates (8) are fixed vertically between the base and the platform to provide light tight partition between the cuvettes. In between the rows of cuvettes, partitions are provided so that the holder can be introduced in the base unit thought the top over (9), with the vertical plate (10) carrying the light detectors coming in between the rows of cuvettes. The base unit which works as an optical bench has fixed to its base, a vertical detector carrying plate (1), a solid state laser (11) and a set of mirrors (12) so arranged as to reflect, split and direct the light from light source (11) through each cuvette to fall on a light detector (usually a silicon photo voltaic type). The light path with respect to the laser light source, mirrors, cuvettes and detector carrying plate (10) are shown in a plan view in Fig. 4 of the drawings. The specific example of sample holder as shown in the accompanying figures can hold six cuvettes. Any number fo cuvettes which may be required.<br><br>
and can be conveniently handled by the instrumentation can be used. An e cample of such a number is that which can be handled by the data acquisition card. A norm? 1 12-bit card has 16-single ended channels, so a 16 cuvette multi sample holder in two rows of eight cuvettes or four rows of four cuvettes, may be practical. The dimensions of cuvettes and the metal parts may be optimized, reduced or enlarged to any extent dictated only by the need and feasibility. As the number of cuvettes increases and arranged in multiples of two, three or four etc., that is in two, three, or four etc. rows, the length of the detector carrying plate increases to accommodate as many detectors (as there are cuvettes). Also, the intensity (or power) of the laser beam may restrict the number (of cuvettes). Even then, more than one laser may be used.<br>
Finally, the purpose of such an integrated construction of the 3D-holder is that when the cuvettes with sample slurries are in place with the top sealed with rubber 2 and plate 3, it could be turned over a number of times for thorough mixing of the slurries before introducing it in the optical bench and initiating data acquisition. The integral unit ensures that there is no spilling of the slurries during turning over and the slurries are uniform at the start of data acquisition, a precondition for the method of sedimentation to be reliable. The advantages of the present invention are:<br>
1.	A construction in metal where a number of transparent cuvettes are arranged in two  or<br>
more rows as a single unit.<br>
2.	A construction where rubber is used to seal the open ends of cuvettes, making it possible<br>
to turn the unit over without spilling any liquid or slurry contained by the cuvettes.<br>
3.	An arrangement where the cuvette unit or holder can be introduced in a light tight and<br>
enclosed optical bench having a light source and an array of mirrors to direct the light<br>
through the cuvettes on to the   detectors to measure light intensity transmitted by the<br>
cuvettes.<br>
4.	The cuvette unit or holder is constructed out of any rigid solid in a manner that makes it<br>
possible to hold the cuvettes rigidly in rows with the space between the rows as arches,<br>
making it possible to introduce the holder injhe base unit with the detector plate taking up<br>
the space between the rows of cuvettes.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
We Claim:<br>
1.	A particle size analyzer for holding multiple sample holder, which comprises: a base plate<br>
(13) having a top plate (9) with an opening, supported by vertical elements (14), the said<br>
base plate being provided with light source (11) so as to direct light to the first of a series of<br>
mirrors (12) to reflecting the light beam to a centrally placed photo detector (10) and<br>
simultaneously splitting the said light beam so as to direct the said beam to the subsequent<br>
