				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to the field of processes for synthesising steroids,<br>
and in particular to a process for the industrial scale preparation of drospirenone.<br>
STATE OF THE ART<br>
The  compound  of  formula  (I)   given   hereinafter,  whose  chemical   name  is<br>
6β7β;15β,16β-dimethylene-3-oxo-17α-pregn-4-ene-21,17-carbolactone,	is<br>
commonly known as drospirenone:<br><br>
It    is    a    synthetic    steroid    with    progestogenic,    antimineralocorticoid    and<br>
antiandrogenic activity; by virtue of these characteristics drospirenone has long<br>
been used for preparing pharmaceutical compositions with contraceptive action for<br>
oral administration.<br>
Many  processes are  known in the  literature for preparing  drospirenone,  for<br>
example the process described in European Patent No. 0 075 189, starting from<br>
3β7α15ot-trihydroxy-5-androsten-17-one   passing   via   the   intermediate   5,6β<br>
epoxy-7β-hydroxy-15β16β-methylene-3β-pivaloyloxy-5β-androstan-17-one.<br>
As described in EP 0 075 189, this intermediate is then transformed into 7a-<br>
chloro-5,6β-epoxy-15β,16β-methylene-3β-pivaloyloxy-5β-androstan-17-one   by   a<br>
reaction that uses tetrachloromethane both as reagent and reaction solvent. The<br>
use of this  highly toxic solvent in  relatively  large quantities is one of the<br>
unfavourable aspects of this process.<br>
in the process described in EP 0 075 189 the intermediate 17α-(3-hydroxypropyl)-<br>
6β7β;15(5,16β-dimethylene-5β-androstane-3β,5,17β-triol  is   arrived  at  from  the<br><br>
intermediate	7a-chloro-5,6β-epoxy-15β,16β-methylene-3β-pivaloyloxy-5 β<br>
androstan-17-one by way of several steps, from which the final product drospirenone is obtained by oxidising with a pyridine/water/chromic anhydride mixture under hot conditions. This step constitutes a further disadvantage of the known process: chromic anhydride, as all Cr (VI) compounds, is actually a known carcinogen whose use is subject to legislative restrictions such that the precautions required during the use and disposal of these products render them practically unusable.<br>
Another process for preparing drospirenone is described in European Patent No. 918 791 81 wherein the drospirenone is produced in two distinct phases starting<br>
from    l7a-(3-hydroxypropyi)-6β7β15β6β"dimethylene'5(3-androstane-3β,5,17β-<br>
thol, using a ruthenium salt as oxidant; in the examples given in said patent crude<br>
drospirenone is obtained with a chromatographic purity of 93% which is then<br>
improved by chromatography.<br>
At  this  point  it  is worth   noting that  a  possible  technique   is the   systematic<br>
chromatographic purification of industrial batches of steroids, requiring however<br>
dedicated equipment and working environments and consequently a considerable<br>
logistic and economic involvement.<br>
There   is   therefore   still   a   need   for   a   process   which   enables   high   purity<br>
drospirenone    to    be    prepared,    but    without    presenting    the    aforestated<br>
disadvantages of processes of the known art.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The Applicant has now developed a process that enables drospirenone with a high<br>
degree   of   purity   to   be   obtained,   suitable   for   use   in   the   preparation   of<br>
pharmaceutical     compositions,     and     which    overcomes     the     aforestated<br>
disadvantages connected to the use of toxic and carcinogenic reagents and the<br>
need for chromatographic purifications of crude drospirenone to obtain a high final<br>
purity.<br>
Subject of the present invention is therefore a process for the preparation of<br>
drospirenone, comprising the oxidation of 17a-(3-hydroxypropyl)-6β,7β,15β6β-<br>
dimethylene-5p-androstane-3β;5,17βtriol of formula (VIII) with a suitable oxidising<br>
agent in an organic solvent in the presence of a catalytic amount of 2,2,6,6-<br><br><br>

 <br>
tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl radical or a derivative thereof, said oxidation being followed by the addition of a protic acid directly into the same reactor in which the oxidation took place, to obtain the drospirenone of formula (I)<br><br>
Further subject of the invention is drospirenone obtained by the above said<br>
process, and a pharmaceutical composition comprising the drospirenone obtained<br>
by the above said process as active principle, and a carrier.<br>
The characteristics and advantages of the present process will be illustrated in<br>
detail in the description which follows.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The  oxidation  substrate  of the  present  process,  i.e.   17α(3-hydroxypropyl)-<br>
6β,7β,15β,16β-dimethylene-5β-androstane-3β,5,17β-triol, can be obtained starting<br>
from  commercial  products  by procedures  known to  any  expert of the  art.<br>
Preferably   this   product   is   obtained   from   5,6(3-epoxy-7(3-hydroxy-15(3,16(3-<br>
methylene-3(3-pivaloyloxy-5(3-androstan-17-one, in accordance with the procedure<br>
comprising the following steps:<br>
a) bromination in position 7a of 5,6(3-epoxy-7 p-hydroxy-15 β,16β-methylene-3 (3-<br>
pivaloyloxy-5(3-androstan-17-one of formula (II) to obtain 7a-bromo-5,6(3-epoxy-<br>
15 (3,16(3-methylene-3[3-pivaloyloxy-5 (3-androstan-17-one    of   formula    (III)    by<br>
reacting  the  compound  of  formula  (II)  with  mesyl   chloride  to   obtain  the<br>
corresponding mesylate which is not isolated and from which the compound of<br>
formula (III) is obtained by the addition of lithium bromide:<br><br><br>
in which the symbol PV indicates a pivaloyl group, i.e. atrimethyiacetyl group;<br>
b)	opening the epoxy ring and removing the bromine from 7a-bromo-5,β-epoxy-<br>
15β,16βmethylene-3β-pivaloyloxy-5β-androstan-17-one  of formula  (III)  coming<br>
from step a) to obtain 5-hydroxy-15β,16β-methylene-3β-pivaloyloxy-5β-androst-6-en-17-one of formula (IV):<br><br>
c)	hydrolysis of the pivaloyl group of 5-hydroxy-15β,16β-methylene-3 (3-<br>
pivaloyloxy-5βandrost-6-en-17-one of formula (IV) coming from step b) to obtain<br>
3β5-dihydroxy-15β,16β-methylene-5β-androst-6-en-17-one of formula (V):<br><br>
in which PV is defined as above,<br>
d)	methylenation at the A6 double bond of 3β,5-dihydroxy-15β,16β-methylene-5β<br>
androst-6-en-17-one of formula (V) coming from step c), to obtain 3β,5-dihydroxy-<br>
6β7β;15β,16β-dimethylene-5β-andros 7-one of formula (VI)<br><br><br>
e)	reacting    3β5β hydroxy-6β7β;15β6β-dimethylene-5β-anclrost-17-one    of<br>
formula (VI) coming from step d) with propargyl alcohol to obtain 17-(3-hydroxy-<br>
l-propinyl) 6β,7β, 15β, 16β,-dimethylene-5β-androstane-3β,5,17β-triol    of    formula<br><br>
f)	hydrogenating 17β-(3-hydroxy-1-propinyl)-6 (3β,7 β15 β,16 βdimethylene-5 β-<br>
androstane-3β,5β β-triol of formula (VII) coming from step e) to obtain 17a-(3-<br>
hydroxypropyl)-6β7β;15β,16β-dimethylene-5β-androstane-3β,5,17β-triol	of<br><br>
The starting 5,6 p-epoxy-7 p-hydroxy-15 β,16β-methylene-3 p-pivaloyloxy-5 p-androstan-17-one of formula (I) can be in its turn obtained from 3(3-hydroxy-5-<br><br>
androsten-17-one as described in European Patent No. 0 075 189. The bromination reaction in step a) is preferably carried out by adding  mesyl chloride and pyridine to the starting compound at room temperature with the formation of the corresponding mesylate, then adding lithium bromide dissolved in water and bringing the temperature to values between 70 and 75°C.<br>
The successive steps a) to f) can be carried out in accordance with procedures commonly utilised and known to any skilled person.<br>
The term "suitable oxidising agent" in accordance with the invention means a product chosen from the group consisting of hypohalides of alkali and alkaline-earth metals, preferably calcium and sodium hypochlorite, iodine, oxygen in the presence of CuCI, potassium peroxymonosulfate KHSC% known commercially as Oxone®, and 1,3,5-trichIoro-2,4,6-triazinetrione.<br>
Derivatives of the 2,2,6,6-tetramethyIpiperidine-1-oxyl radical of possible use in the present process are chosen for example from the 4-hydroxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethyIpiperidine-1-oxyl radical, the 4-methoxy-2,2,6,6-tetrarnethylpiperidine-1 -oxyl radical and the 4-(benzoyloxy)-2,2,6J6-tetramethylpiperidine-1 -oxyl radical. As organic solvent for the oxidation reaction a solvent chosen from the group consisting of ethers such as acetone, methyl t-butyl ether and tetrahydrofuran, esters such as ethyl acetate, hydrocarbons such as toluene, halogenated hydrocarbons, such as methylene chloride, and mixtures thereof, can be used. The oxidation reaction and subsequent dehydration can be carried out for example at a temperature between 0 and 40°C, preferably at a temperature between 20 and 25°C.<br>
Preferred reaction conditions are those in which the oxidation is carried out with calcium hypochlorite using as organic solvent a methylene chloride/tetrahydrofuran mixture, preferably in a 8.5/1 ratio, at a temperature between 20 and 25°C in the presence of a catalytic amount of 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl radical and in the presence of an aqueous sodium bicarbonate solution.<br>
At the end of the oxidation reaction a protic acid is added directly to the organic solution in which the oxidation reaction took place. Alternatively, the organic solution in which the oxidation reaction took place is distilled until a semi-solid<br><br>
residue is obtained which is then redissolved in a suitable organic solvent, and to<br>
the so obtained solution the protic acid is then added.<br>
The aforesaid protic acid is chosen for example from the group consisting of<br>
concentrated hydrochloric acid, dilute hydrochloric acid and p-toluenesulfonic acid;<br>
preferably the protic acid used is p-toluenesulfonic acid monohydrate.<br>
The crude drospirenone obtained with the present process as described above<br>
has a high degree of purity, being greater than 96.5%, which can nevertheless be<br>
increased  by subjecting the crude product coming from the oxidation to  a<br>
purification procedure to obtain drospirenone with a degree of purity greater than<br>
99.5%.<br>
To obtain drospirenone with said degree of purity no chromatographic procedure is<br>
necessary, but a filtration through gel and decolourising carbon is sufficient,<br>
followed by crystallisation of the filtrate from solvent, the two steps of filtration and<br>
crystallisation possibly being repeated one or more times.<br>
Preferably the gel utilised in accordance with the invention is silica gel, while the<br>
crystallisation solvent can be chosen from the group consisting of ethyl ether,<br>
isopropyl ether, ethyl acetate, methyl  tertbutyl ether, isopropyl acetate, methyl<br>
acetate, dimethoxyethane, methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, methylene chloride,<br>
acetone,   dimethylacetamide,   dimethyl-formamide   and   mixtures   thereof;   the<br>
preferred crystallisation solvent is isopropyl acetate.<br>
In accordance with a particularly preferred embodiment of the invention, the<br>
present purification procedure comprises the following steps:<br>
i) dissolving crude drospirenone in a suitable organic solvent, further containing<br>
silica gel and decolourising carbon, and filtering the solution thus obtained;<br>
ii) distilling the solution coming from step i) and   redissolving the distillate in a<br>
second organic solvent;<br>
iii) distilling the solution coming from step ii) and redissolving the distillate in said<br>
second organic solvent;<br>
iv) crystallising pure drospirenone from the solution coming from step iii);<br>
v) recovering pure drospirenone by filtering, washing over the filter at least once<br>
with a suitable organic solvent, then drying at a pressure lower than atmospheric<br>
pressure;<br><br>
vi) if necessary repeating steps i) to v), starting from the drospirenone coming from<br>
step v).<br>
The amount of silica gel and decolourising carbon employed in step i) is preferably<br>
less than 5% by weight with respect of the weight of the crude drospirenone to be<br>
purified.<br>
The distillation  steps ii) and iii) are preferably carried out at a distillation<br>
temperature between 35 and 45°C, and at a pressure lower than atmospneric<br>
pressure.<br>
In step iv) said crystallisation is carried out at a temperature between 0 and 5°C for<br>
a time period between 60 and 180 minutes.<br>
The organic solvent used in steps i), ii), iii) and v) is chosen for example from the<br>
group consisting of ethyl ether, isopropyl ether, ethyl acetate, isopropyl acetate,<br>
methyl acetate, dimethoxyethane,  methanol,  ethanol,  isopropanol,  methylene<br>
chloride, acetone, dimethylacetamide, dimethylformamide, methyl tertbutyl ether<br>
and mixtures thereof.<br>
Preferably the organic solvent in step i) is methylene chloride, the organic solvent<br>
in step ii) is isopropyl acetate, and in step v) two washings are undertaken, the first<br>
with isopropyl acetate and the second with ethyl ether.<br>
The present process for drospirenone preparation as described above has proved<br>
to be advantageous in that it enables preparation of the intermediate 7oc-bromo-<br>
5,6 p-epoxy-15 p,16 p-methylene-3 (3-pivaloyloxy-5 p-androstan-17-one, useful for<br>
drospirenone synthesis, while avoiding toxic solvents and  reagents such as<br>
tetrachloromethane as used in the process given in EP 0 075 189. Furthermore,<br>
though preparation of this brominated intermediate passes via the formation of a<br>
mesylated intermediate, it does not involve an additional process step because the<br>
mesylate is not isolated but brominated directly.<br>
The use of carcinogenic reagents is also avoided in the oxidation step which, as<br>
well as not requiring carcinogenic reagents, is just as efficient as the oxidation with<br>
chromic anhydride described in EP 0 075 189.<br>
Finally, the purification process described above enables the inverted  lactone<br>
fraction that is present in the crude product and identified as ZK35096 in US<br>
Patent 6,121,465, to be completely eliminated without the use of chromatographic<br><br>
techniques. This purification process is applicable and useful for the purification<br>
not only of drospirenone prepared in accordance with the present process, but<br>
also of products obtained with other processes and in which the aforementioned<br>
inverted lactone is present as impurity.<br>
The following examples are given as non-limiting illustrations of the present<br>
invention.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
Preparation    of    7g-bromo-5,6 B-epoxy-15 S,16 3-methylene-3 &amp;-pivalovloxy-5 B-<br>
androstan-17-one - Step a)<br>

androstan-17-one are dissolved in 205 ml of pyridine in a 2 litre flask, under<br>
nitrogen.<br>
17.5 ml of  mesyl chloride are added from a dropping funnel, maintaining a<br>
temperature of 20/25QC.<br>
The mixture is stirred for 1 hour at 20QC to obtain a thick orange suspension.<br>
The progress of the reaction is checked by TLC. Once the reaction is completed,<br>
83.2 g of lithium bromide dissolved  in 54 ml of water are added  and the<br>
temperature is brought to 70/75-C. After 3 hours another 8 g of lithium bromide<br>
dissolved in water and 50 ml of pyridine are added.<br>
At the end of the reaction (checked by TLC) the temperature is brought to 60eC<br>
and 700 ml of water are added; it is left to cool to 15/20QC, maintaining under<br>
stirring for 1 hour at this temperature.<br>
The solid is filtered off and washed with 500 ml of water.<br>
The solid is dried for 24 hours under reduced pressure at 459C to obtain 69.5 g of<br>
the title compound.<br>
On the product thus obtained, purified by chromatography,   1H-NMR and mass<br>
spectroscopic analyses were carried out, and the following results were obtained:<br>
1H-NMR (300 MHz, CDCI3): 5 (ppm) 0.92 (18-Me, s, 3H); 1.04 (19-Me, s, 3H);<br>
1.08-1.16 (m, 1H); 1.16 (t-But, s, 9H); 1.18-1.28 (m, 1H); 1.36-1.60 (m, 8H); 1.62-<br>

27 g of powdered zinc suspended in 91 ml of THF (tetrahydrofuran) are fed into a<br>
1 litre flask, under nitrogen.<br>
A solution of 67.5 g of 7<x-bromo-5 p-epoxy-15 p p-pivaloyloxy-></x-bromo-5>
5 p-andros    
then added; 19.9 ml of glacial acetic acid are slowly added dropwise, maintaining<br>
the  temperature   below  60-C  during  the  addition.   The   reaction   mixture  is<br>
maintained under stirring for 3 hours at 59/60-C.<br>
At the end of the reaction (checked by TLC) and after cooling to 50QC, the zinc is<br>
filtered off over dicalite and the filter washed with 200 ml of THF.<br>
The filtered solution is brought to pH 9 with 60 ml of triethylamine.<br>
The solution is concentrated under reduced pressure at 50eC to obtain about 180<br>
g of a semi-solid product which is dissolved in 500 ml of a 5% acetic acid-water<br>
solution (pH=4 with a precipitate).<br>
It is maintained under stirring for 1 hour at 10/15eC, the solid is filtered off and<br>
washed with 500 ml of water then dried under reduced pressure for 12 hours at<br>
50-C, thus obtaining 57 g of crude product.<br>
The crude product is refluxed for 1 hour in a mixture of 115 ml of t-butyl methyl<br>
ether and 114 ml of ethyl acetate (partial dissolution).<br>
It is cooled for 1 hour at 0/5QC, the solid is filtered off and washed with t-butyl<br>
methyl ether and dried under reduced pressure for 1 hour at 609C.<br>
44.6 g of the title compound are obtained.<br>
The  analytical   data  obtained  from   a  sample  purified   by   chromatography<br>
correspond to those given in EP 0 075 189.<br>

and 12.9 g of potassium hydroxide are fed into a 2 litre flask, under nitrogen at<br>
20gC. The suspension is stirred at 209C for 3 hours.<br>
At the end of the reaction (checked by TLC), the reaction mixture is poured into 2<br>
litres of water, brought to pH 7 with 20% sulphuric acid (about 25 ml) then the<br>
suspension is stirred for 1 hour at 0/5-C. The solid is filtered off, washed with water<br>
and dried for 12 hours under reduced pressure at 50QC to obtain 30.6 g of the title<br>
