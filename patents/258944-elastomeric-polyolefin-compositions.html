"ELASTOMERIC POLYOLEFIN COMPOSITIONS"<br>
The present invention concerns elastomeric polyolefin compositions and the process for their preparation.<br>
As is known, isotactic polypropylene, though being endowed with an exceptional combination of excellent properties, is affected by the drawback of insufficient impact resistance at relatively low temperatures and low elongation properties.<br>
According to the teachings of the prior art, it is possible to obviate the said drawbacks, without sensibly affecting the other polymer properties, by adding rubber. This is obtained by modifying the synthesis process or by blending polypropylene with rubbers.<br>
The modification of the synthesis process comprises, after polymerizing propylene to isotactic polymer, copolymerizing ethylene and propylene mixtures in the presence of the isotactic polymer. Processes and compositions representative of the prior art are described in USP3,200,173, USP3,629,368, USP3,670,053, USP6,313,227 and European patent application No. 0 077 532.<br>
The polyolefin compositions described in EP application 03007669.9 (published as WO2004/087807) possess high rigidity and good impact resistance. The said balance of properties is achieved by a composition that comprises (A) a high crystalline propylene homopolymer or copolymer having a broad polydispersity index and (B) an elastomeric ethylene copolymer and in which the ethylene content of the fraction collected at 90° C as a result of temperature rising elution fractionation (TREF) satisfies a specific relation. The drawback of said compositions is that they do not have satisfactory elongation.<br>
The polyolefin compositions described in EP application No. 4012148.5 possess high elongation at break and good impact resistance. The drawback that rigidity is not so high when the elongation is high- Compositions with high values of elongation at break contain high amounts of elastomeric polymer.<br>
It has now been found that it is possible to obtain polypropylene compositions with a particularly advantageous balance of properties, in particular high elongation at break and good impact resistance without a remarkable decrease in rigidity properties.<br>
The advantage of the composition according to the present invention is that high elongation properties are achieved by a relative low content of elastomeric polymer in the composition.<br><br>
Another advantage is the relative high stiffness of the composition in spite of the fact that the composition exhibits high elongation at break values.<br>
Another advantage is that articles prepared with the composition according to the present invention can be used for several applications at low temperatures without failure of the articles due to the good impact resistance in terms of both ductile/brittle transition temperature and Izod impact resistance.<br>
The composition according to the present invention can be easily converted into various kinds of finished and semi-finished articles, in particular by using injection-moulding and meimofonning techniques. The particular balance of properties and high values of elongation at break make the present composition suitable for the automotive field, in particular for bumpers.<br>
Thus the present invention relates to an olefin polymer composition comprising (by weight, unless otherwise specified):<br>
A)	60-85%, preferably 65-80%, more preferably 65-75%, of a crystalline propylene homopolymer or a crystalline copolymer of propylene containing 3% or less of ethylene or C4-C00 a-olcfin(s) or of combinations thereof, said homopolymer or copolymer having a Polydispersity Index (P.I.) value of from 4.5-6, preferably 4.5-5.5, and a content of isotactic pentads (rrimrnm), measured by 13C NMR on the fraction insoluble in xylene at 25 °C, higher than 96%, preferably higher than 98%;<br>
B)	15-40%, preferably 20-35%, more preferably 25-35%, of a partially amorphous copolymer of ethylene containing from 35% to 70%, preferably from 40 to 55%, of propylene or C4-C10 oc-olefin(s) or of combinations thereof, and optionally minor proportions of a diene.<br>
The olefin polymer composition according to the present invention exhibits a value of elongation at break ranging from 150 to 600%, preferably 200-500%, according to ISO method 527.<br>
Particularly preferred features of the composition of the present invention are:<br>
a molecular weight distribution in component (A), expressed by the Mw /Mn ratio, measured by GPC, ranging from 6 to 9;<br>
a value of Mz /Mw ratio in component (A), measured by GPC, equal to or higher than 2.5, in particular from 2.5 to 4.5, typically 3-4; and<br><br>
Flexural Modulus (according to ISO 178) from 700 to 1500 MPa, more preferably from 900 to 1300 MPa;<br>
Melt Flow Rate (MFR) from 0.5 to 45 g/10 min., more preferably from 2 to 20 g/10<br>
min. (according to ISOl 133, measured at 230 °C, 2.16 kg load).<br>
The composition according to the present invention preferably exhibits values of<br>
impact resistance in terms of ductile/brittle transition temperature less than -50° C. The Izod<br>
impact resistance of the said composition is preferably over 12 kJ/m   at 23° C and over 7<br>
kJ/m2at0°C.<br>
The term "copolymer" as used herein refers to both polymers with two different recurring units and polymers with more than two different recurring units, such as terpolymers, in the chain.<br>
Component (A) is preferably a propylene homopolymer<br>
The stereoregularity of the polymer of component (A) is of the isotactic type.<br>
The copolymers of components (A) and (B) contain recurring units derived from ethylene and/or butene-1, pentene-1, 4-methyl-peTitene-l, hexene-1 and octane-1 or combination therereof. The preferred comonomer is ethylene. The total quantity of copolymcrized ethylene is preferably from 9 to 20% by weight C opolymer (B) can optionally contain recurring units derived from a diene, conjugated or not, such as butadiene-1, ls4-hexadiene, l?5-hexadiene and ethylidene-norbornene-1. The diene, when present is typically present in an amount of from 0.5 to 10% by weight with respect to the weight of the copolymer.<br>
As previously said, the compositions of the present invention can be prepared with a polymerization process comprising at least two stages, where in the first stage the relevant monomer(s) are polymerized to form component (A) and in the following stage(s) the mixtures ethylene-propylene, ethylene-propylene and one or more C4-C]o a-olefin(s), ethylene and one or more C4-C10 a-olefin(s) and, optionally, a diene, are polymerized to form component (B).<br>
Thus, the present invention relates also to a process for preparing the previously said compositions by a sequential polymerization comprising at least two sequential steps, wherein components (A) and (B) are prepared in separate subsequent steps, operating in each step, except the first step, in the presence of the polymer formed and the catalyst used in the preceding step. The catalyst is added only in the first step, however its activity is such that it is still active for all the subsequent steps. Component (A) is preferably prepared in ofie or<br><br>
two polymerization stages. The order of the polymerization stages is not a critical process feature, however component (A) is preferably prepared before component (B).<br>
The polymerization can occur in liquid phase, gas phase or liquid-gas phase.<br>
For example, it is possible to carry out the propylene polymerization stage using liquid propylene as diluent, and the following copolymerization stage in gas phase, without intermediate stages except for the partial degassing of the propylene.<br>
Examples of suitable reactors are continuously operated stirred reactors, loop reactors, fhiidized-bed reactors or horizontally or vertically stirred powder bed reactors. Of course, the reaction can also be carried out in a plurality of reactors connected in series.<br>
It is possible to carry out the polymerization in a cascade of stirred gas-phase reactors which are connected in series and in which the pulverulent reaction bed is kept in motion by means of a vertical stirrer. The reaction bed generally comprises the polymer which is polymerized in the respective reactor.<br>
Propylene polymerization to form component (A) can be done in the presence of ethylene and/or one or more C4-C]o a-olefm(s), such as for example butene-1, pentene-1, 4-methylpentene-1, hexene-1 and octene-1, or combinations thereof.<br>
As previously said, the copolymerization of ethylene with propylene (preferred) and/or other C4-Cio a-olefin(s) to form component (B) can occur in the presence of a diene.<br>
Component (B) is partially soluble in xylene at ambient temperature (i.e. 25° C). The amount of xylene-soluble fraction of component (B) at ambient temperature typically ranges from 60 to 92% by weight. The intrinsic viscosity of said fraction typically ranges from 1.8 to 4 dl/g, preferably 2.5-3.5 dl/g.<br>
Reaction time, pressure and temperature relative to the polymerization steps are not critical,, however it is better if the temperature is from 20 to 150 °C, in particular from 50 to 100 °C. The pressure can be atmospheric or higher.<br>
The regulation of the molecular weight is carried out by using known regulators, hydrogen in particular.<br>
The compositions of the present invention can also be produced by a gas-phase polymerisation process carried out in at least two interconnected polymerisation zones. The said type of process is illustrated in European patent application 782 587.<br>
In detail, the above-mentioned process comprises feeding one or more monomer(s) to said polymerisation zones in the presence of catalyst under reaction conditions and collecting the<br>
4<br><br>
polymer product from the said polymerisation zones. In the said process the growing polymer particles flow upward through one (first) of the said polymerisation zones (riser) under fast fluidisation conditions, leave the said riser and enter another (second) polymerisation zone (downcomer) through which they flow downwards in a densified form under the action of gravity, leave the said downcomer and are reintroduced into the riser, thus establishing a circulation of polymer between the riser and the downcomer.<br>
In the downcomer high values of density of the solid are reached, which approach the bulk density of the polymer. A positive gain in pressure can thus be obtained along the direction of flow, so that it becomes possible to reintroduce the polymer into the riser without the help of special mechanical means. In this way, a "loop" circulation is set up, which is defined by the balance of pressures between the two polymerisation zones and by the head loss introduced into the system.<br>
Generally, the condition of fast fluidization in the riser is established by feeding a gas mixture comprising the relevant monomers to the said riser. It is preferable that the feeding of the gas mixture is effected below the point of reintroduction of the polymer into the said riser by the use, where appropriate, of gas distributor means. The velocity of transport gas into the riser is higher than the transport velocity under the operating conditions, preferably from 2 to 15 m/s.<br>
Generally, the polymer and the gaseous mixture leaving the riser are conveyed to a solid/gas separation zone. The solid/gas separation can be effected by using conventional separation means. From the separation zone, the polymer enters the downcomer. The gaseous mixture leaving the separation zone is compressed, cooled and transferred, if appropriate with the addition of make-up monomers and/or molecular weight regulators, to the riser. The transfer can be effected by means of a recycle line for the gaseous mixture.<br>
The control of the polymer circulating between the two polymerisation zones can be effected by metering the amount of polymer leaving the downcomer using means suitable for controlling the flow of solids, such as mechanical valves.<br>
The operating parameters, such as the temperature, are those that are usual in gas-phase olefin polymerisation process, for example from 50 to 120 °C.<br>
This process can be carried out under operating pressures of between 0.5 and 10 MPa, preferably from 1.5 to 6 MPa.<br><br>
Advantageously, one or more inert gases are maintained in the polymerisation zones, in such quantities that the sum of the partial pressure of the inert gases is preferably between 5 and 80% of the total pressure of the gases. The inert gas can be nitrogen or propane, for example.<br>
The various catalysts are fed up to the riser at any point of the said riser. However, they can also be fed at any point of the downcomer. The catalyst can be in any physical state, therefore catalysts in either solid or liquid state can be used.<br>
Preferably the polymerization catalyst is a Ziegler-Natta catalyst comprising a solid catalyst component comprising:<br>
a)	Mg, Ti and halogen and at least two electron donor compounds, said catalyst component being characterized by the fact that at least one of the electron-donor compounds, which is present in an amount from 15 to 50% by mol with respect to the total amount of donors, is selected from esters of succinic acids which are not extractable, under the conditions described below, for more than 20% by mol and at least another electron donor compound which is extractable, under the same conditions, for more than 30% by mol;<br>
b)	an alkylaluminum compound and, optionally (but preferably);<br>
c)	one or more electron-donor compounds (external donor).<br>
The esters of succinic acids not extractable for more than 20% by mol are defined as non-extractable succinates. The electron-donor compounds extractable for more than 30% by mol are defined as extractable electron-donor compounds.<br>
Preferably, it is used a succinate which is not extractable for more than 15% and another electron donor compound which is extractable for more than 35%.<br>
The non-cxtractable succinates are preferably selected from succinates of formula (I) below:<br><br>
wherein the radicals Rj and R2, equal to, or different from, each other are a C1-C20 linear or branched alkyi, alkenyl, cycloalkyl, aryl, arylalkyl or alkylaryl group, optionally containing<br><br>
heteroatoms; the radicals R3 to R.6 equal to, or different from, each other, are hydrogen or a Q-C20 linear or branched alkyl, alkenyl, cycloalkyl, aryL, arylalkyl or alkylaryl group, optionally containing heteroatoms, and the radicals R3 to R^ which are joined to the same carbon atom can be linked together to form a cycle; with the proviso that when R3 to R5 are contemporaneously hydrogen R$ is a radical selected from primary branched, secondary or tertiary alkyl groups, cycloalkyl, aryl, arylalkyl or alkylaryl groups having from 3 to 20 carbon atoms, or a linear alkyl group having at least four carbon atoms optionally containing heteroatoms.<br>
Preferably, the amount of non-extractable succinates is between 20 and 45% by mole, more preferably from 22 to 40% by mol, with respect to the total amount of the electron donor compounds. Among the non-extractable succinates mentioned above, particularly preferred are the succinates of formula (II) below:<br><br>
in which the radicals R] and R2, equal to, or different from, each other are a Cj-C2o linear or branched alkyl, alkenyl, cycloalkyl, aryl, arylalkyl or alkylaryl group, optionally containing heteroatoms; and the radicals R3 and R4 equal to, or different from, each other, are C1-C20 alkyl, cycloalkyl, aryl, arylalkyl or alkylaryl group, optionally containing heteroatoms with the proviso that at least one of them is a branched alkyl; said compounds being, with respect to the two asymmetric carbon atoms identified in the structure of formula (II), stereoisomers of the type (S,R) or (R,S) that are present in pure forms or in mixtures.<br>
Among the extractable electron-donor compounds particularly preferred arc the esters of mono or dicarboxylic organic acids such as benzoates, malonates, phthalates and certain succinates. They are described in US patent 4,522,930 and European patent 45977, for example. Particularly suited are the phthalic acid esters. Alkylphthalates are preferred, such as diisobutyl, dioctyl and diphenyl phthalate and benzyl-butyl phthalate.<br>
The extractability test is carried out as follows. A. Preparation of the solid catalyst component<br>
Into a 500ml four-necked round flask, purged with nitrogen, 250 ml of TiCU are<br>
introduced at 0°C. While stirring, 10.Q g of microspheroidal MgCl2*2.8C2H5OH (prepared<br>
7<br><br>
according to the method described in ex.2 of USP 4,399,054 but operating at 3,000 rpm instead of 10,000) are introduced. 4.4 mMoles of the selected electron donor compound are also added.<br>
The temperature is raised to 100 °C and maintained at that temperature for 120 min. Then, the stirring is discontinued, the solid product is allowed to settle and the supernatant liquid is siphoned off.<br>
250 ml of fresh TiCU are added. The mixture is reacted at 120°C for 60 min under stirring and, then, the supernatant liquid is siphoned off. The solid (A) is washed six times with anhydrous hexane (6 x 100 ml) at 60 °C. dried under vacuum and analysed for the quantitative determination of Mg and electron donor compound. The ratio of the electron donor compound with respect to Mg (ratio A) is thus determined. B. Treatment of solid (A)<br>
In a 250 ml jacketed glass reactor with mechanical stirrer and filtration septum are introduced under nitrogen atmosphere 190 ml of anhydrous n-hexane, 19 mMoles of AlEts and 2 gr of the catalyst component prepared as described in A. The mixture is heated at 60°C for 1 hour under stirring (stirring speed at 400 rpm). After that time the mixture is filtered, washed four times with n-hexane at 60DC and finally dried under vacuum for 4 hours at 30°C. The solid is then analysed for the quantitative determination of Mg and electron donor compound The molar ratio of the electron donor compound with respect to Mg (ratio B) is thus determined.<br>
The extractability of the electron donor compound is calculated according to the following formula: %of ED extracted = (Ratio A-Ratio B)/Ratio A.<br>

As explained above, the solid catalyst component comprises, in addition to the above electron donors, Ti, Mg and halogen. In particular, the catalyst component comprises a titanium compound, having at least a Ti-halogen bond and the above mentioned electron donor compounds supported on a Mg halide. The magnesium halide is preferably MgCl2 in active form, which is widely known from the patent literature as a support for Ziegler-Natta catalysts. Patents USP 4,298,718 and USP 4,495,338 were the first to describe the use of these compounds in Ziegler-Natta catalysis. It is known from these patents that the magnesium dihalides in active form used as support or co-support in components of catalysts for the polymerization of olefins are characterized by X-ray spectra in which the most intense diffraction line that appears in the spectrum of the non-active halide is diminished in intensity and is replaced by a halo whose maximum intensity is displaced towards lower angles relative to that of the more intense line.<br>
The preferred titanium compounds are TiCU and T1CI3; furthermore, also Ti-haloalcoholates of formula Ti(OR)n-yXy can be used, where n is the valence of titanium, y<br><br>
is a number between 1 and n, X is halogen and R is a hydrocarbon radical having from 1 to 10 carbon atoms.<br>
The preparation of the solid catalyst component can be carried out according to several methods, well known and described in the art.<br>
According to a preferred method, the solid catalyst component can be prepared by reacting a titanium compound of formula Ti(OR)n-yXy, where n is the valence of titanium and y is a number between 1 and n, preferably TiCU, with a magnesium chloride deriving from an adduct of formula MgCl2-pROH, where p is a number between 0.1 and 6, preferably from 2 to 3.5, and R is a hydrocarbon radical having 1-18 carbon atoms. The adduct can be suitably prepared in spherical form by mixing alcohol and magnesium chloride in the presence of an inert hydrocarbon immiscible with the adduct, operating under stirring conditions at the melting temperature of the adduct (100-130DC). Then, the emulsion is quickly quenched, thereby causing the solidification of the adduct in form of spherical particles.<br>
Examples of spherical adducts prepared according to this procedure are described in USP 4,399,054 and USP 4,469,648. The so obtained adduct can be directly reacted with the Ti compound or it can be previously subjected to thermally controlled dealcoholation (80-130°C) so as to obtain an adduct in which the number of moles of alcohol is generally lower than 3, preferably between 0.1 and 2.5. The reaction with the Ti compound can be carried out by suspending the adduct (dealcoholated or as such) in cold TiCU (generally 0°C); the mixture is heated up to 80-130°C and kept at this temperature for 0.5-2 hours. The treatment with TiCU can be carried out one or more times. The electron donor compound(s) can be added during the treatment with TiCU.<br>
Regardless of the preparation method used, the final amount of the electron donor compound(s) is preferably such that the molar ratio with respect to the MgCb is from 0.01 to 1, more preferably from 0.05 to 0.5.<br>
The said catalyst components and catalysts are described in WO 00/63261, WO 01/57099 and WO 02/30998.<br>
Other catalysts that may be used in the process according to the present invention are metallocene-type catalysts, as described in USP 5,324,800 and EP-A-0 129 368; particularly advantageous are bridged bis-indenyl metallocenes, for instance as described in USP 5,145,819 and EP-A-0 485 823. Another class of suitable catalysts arc the so-called<br><br>
constrained geometry catalysts, as described in EP-A-0 416 815 (Dow), EP-A-0 420 436 (Exxon), EP-A-0 671 404, EP-A-0 643 066 and WO 91/04257.<br>
The catalysts can be pre-contacted with small amounts of olefins (prepolymerization).<br>
The compositions of the present invention can also contain additives commonly employed in the art, such as antioxidants, light stabilizers, heat stabilizers, nucleating agents, colorants and fillers.<br>
In particular, the addition of nucleating agents brings about a considerable improvement in important physical-mechanical properties, such as Flexural Modulus, Heat Distortion Temperature (HDT), tensile strength at yield and transparency.<br>
Typical examples of nucleating agents are the p-tert.-butyl benzoate and the 1,3- and 2,4-dibenzylidenesorbitols.<br>
The nucleating agents are preferably added to the compositions of the present invention in quantities ranging from 0.05 to 2% by weight, more preferably from 0.1 to 1% by weight with respect to the total weight<br>
The addition of inorganic fillers, such as talc, calcium carbonate and mineral fibers, also brings about an improvement to some mechanical properties, such as flexural modulus and HDT. Talc can also have a nucleating effect<br>

This is the measurement of molecular weight distribution of the polymer. To determine the PI value, the modulus separation at low modulus value, e.g. 500 Pa, is determined at a temperature of 200 °C by using a RMS-800 parallel plates rheometer model marketed by Rheometrics (USA), operating at an oscillation frequency which increases from 0.01 rad/second to 100 rad/second From the modulus separation value, the PI can be derived using the following equation:<br>
PI = 54.6 x (modulus separation)"" wherein the modulus separation (MS) is defined as:<br>
MS = (frequency at G' = 500 Pa)/(frequency at G" = 500 Pa) wherein G' is the storage modulus and G" is the loss modulus.<br>

2.5 g of polymer are dissolved in 250 ml of xylene at 135 °C under agitation. After 20 minutes the solution is allowed to cool to 25 °C, still under agitation, and then allowed to settle for 30 minutes. The precipitate is filtered with filter paper, the solution evaporated in nitrogen flow, and the residue dried under vacuum a 80 °C until constant weight is reached Thus one calculates the percent by weight of polymer soluble and insoluble at room temperature (25 °C).<br>

Into a 500 mL four-necked round flask, purged with nitrogen, 250 mL of TiCl4 were introduced at 0 °C. While stirring, 10.0 g of microspheroidal MgCl2*2.8C2H50H (prepared according to the method described in example 2 of USP 4,399,054 but operating at 3000 rpm instead of 10000 rpm), the following internal electron-donor compounds were added: 1.67 mmol of diethyl 2,3-diisopropylsuccinate in racemic form as non-extractable succinate, and<br>
15<br><br>
1.37 mmol of diethyl 2,3- diisopropylsuccinate in meso form and 4.56 mmol of diisobutylphthalate. The temperature was raised to 100° C and maintained for 120 min. Then, the stirring was discontinued, the solid product was allowed to settle and the supernatant liquid was siphoned off. Then 250 ml of fresh TiCU were added. The mixture was reacted at 120° C for 60 min and, then, the supernatant liquid was siphoned off. The solid was washed six times with anhydrous hexane (6 x 100 ml) at 60 °C. Catalyst system and pre-polymerization treatment<br>
Before introducing it into the polymerization reactors, the solid catalyst component described above is contacted at 12° C for 24 minutes with aluminum triethyl (TEAL) and dicyclopentyldimethoxysilane (DCPMS) in such quantity that the weight ratio of TEAL to the solid catalyst component be equal to 11, and the weight ratio TEAL/DCPMS be equal to 3.<br>
The  catalyst  system  is  thee   subjected  to prepolymerization  by  maintaining  it in suspension in liquid propylene at 20° C for about 5 minutes before introducing it into the first polymerization reactor. Polymerization<br>
The polymerization run is conducted in continuous mode in a series of three reactors equipped with devices to transfer the product from one reactor to the one immediately next to it. The first reactor is a liquid phase reactor, the second and third are a fluid bed gas phase reactors. Component (A) is prepared in the first reactor in liquid phase, while component (B) is prepared in said two reactors in gas phase.<br>
Hydrogen is used as molecular weight regulator.<br>
