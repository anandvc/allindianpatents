Coupling agents between filler and elastomer<br>
The present invention relates to compositions comprising an elastomer susceptible to oxi-dative, thermal, dynamic, or light- and/or ozone-induced degradation, a white reinforcing filler, and as coupling agent at least a thio substituted silane or an oligomeric hydrolysis product thereof; to new coupling agents; and to a process for ensuring the coupling of a white reinforcing filler to elastomer compositions reinforced by a white filler, which comprises incorporating into the elastomer at least a thio substituted silane or an oligomeric hydrolysis product thereof and vulcanizing the composition.<br>
For the reinforcing of elastomers with for example silica fillers a coupling agent is preferably added. A widely used coupling agent for this purpose is bis-triethoxysilylpropyl-tetrasulfane (TESPT; or Si 69 from Degussa) as disclosed for example in U.S. 3,873,489.<br>
U.S. 6,313,205 disclosed a sulfur-vulcanizable rubber composition comprising at least one diene elastomer, a white reinforcing filler, and a coupling agent selected from the group of polyorganosiloxanes.<br>
U.S.-A-2003/0199619 discloses blocked mercaptosilane condensates as coupling agents in mineral filled elastomer compositions. Among the advantages in the use of these blocked mercaptosilane condensates over the use of previously described blocked mercaptosilanes are the release of less volative organic compounds during the elastomer compounding process and lower coupling agent loading requirements.<br>
The known coupling agents for mineral filled elastomers do not satisfy in every respect the high requirements which a coupling agent is required to meet, especially with regard to the final mechanical properties of the elastomer such as for example elongation an break, modulus, compression set and heat buildup. Furthermore, good processing safety during the mixing of the elastomer with the filler and the coupling agent is also highly sought.<br>
It has now been found that a specific group of thio substituted silanes or oligomeric hydrolysis products thereof are particularly suitable as coupling agents for ensuring the coupling of a white reinforcing filler with an elastomer.<br><br>
The present invention therefore provides compositions comprising<br>
a)	a naturally occurring or synthetic elastomer susceptible to oxidative, thermal, dynamic, light-induced and/or ozone-induced degradation,<br>
b)	a white reinforcing filler, and<br>
c)	as coupling agent, at least one compound of the formula I<br><br>

The compounds of the formula I can be prepared in per se known manner. For example DE-A-1 173 898 discloses the addition of a mercaptan bearing a silylgroup to an activated alkene like acrylates catalyzed by a base. CD. Hurd, LL Gershbein, JACS 69, 2328 (1947) disclose the base-catalyzed addition of mercaptans to acrylic and methacrylic derivatives. B. Boutevin et al., J. Fluor. Chem. 31, 437 (1986) disclose the addition of mercaptans to al-kenes by radical activation. The most general method for the preparation of sulfides involves the reaction between an alkylhalogenide and a thiolate anion.<br><br>
Component (c) is suitable as coupling agent for ensuring the coupling of a white reinforcing filler with an elastomer.<br>
Elastomers are to be understood as meaning macromolecular materials which after considerable deformation under a small load at room temperature rapidly regain approximately their original shape. See also Hans-Georg Elias, "An Introduction to Polymer Science", Section 12. "Elastomers", pp. 388-393, 1997, VCH Veriagsgesellschatt mbH, Weinheim, Germany or "Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, fifth, completely revised edition, Volume A 23", pp. 221-440 (1993).<br>
Examples of elastomers which may be present in the compositions of the invention are the following materials:<br>
1.	Polymers of diolefins, for example polybutadiene or polyisoprene.<br>
2.	Copolymers of mono- and diolefins with one another or with other vinyl monomers, e.g.<br>
3.	propylene-isobutylene copolymers, propylene-butadiene copolymers, isobutylene-isoprene<br>
4.	copolymers, ethylene-alkyl acrylate copolymers, ethylene-alkyl methacrylate copolymers,<br>
5.	ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymers, acrylonitrile-butadiene copolymers, and also terpolymers<br>
6.	of ethylene with propylene and with a diene, such as hexadiene, dicyclopentadiene or ethyli-<br>
7.	denenorbornene.<br>
8.	Copolymers of styrene or a-methylstyrene with dienes or with acrylic derivatives, e.g. sty-<br>
9.	rene-butadiene, styrene-butadiene-alkyl acrylate and styrene-butadiene-alkyl methacrylate;<br>
10.	block copolymers of styrene, e.g. styrene-butadiene-styrene, styrene-isoprene-styrene and<br>
11.	styrene-ethylenebutylene-styrene, and also adhesives prepared from the latter three.<br>
4.	Halogen-containing polymers, e.g. polychloroprene, chlorinated rubber, chlorinated or<br>
brominated copolymer of isobutylene-isoprene (halobutyl rubber).<br>
5.	Natural rubber.<br>
6.	Aqueous emulsions of natural or synthetic rubbers, e.g. natural rubber latex or latices of<br>
7.	carboxylated styrene-butadiene copolymers.<br><br>
The elastomers of interest are preferably natural or synthetic rubber or vulcanizates prepared therefrom. Particular preference is given to polydiene vulcanizates, halogen-containing polydiene vulcanizates, polydiene copolymer vulcanizates, in particular styrene-butadiene copolymer vulcanizates, and ethylene-propylene terpolymer vulcanizates.<br>
In the present application, "reinforcing" white filler is to be understood to mean a white filler capable of reinforcing alone, without any means other than an intermediate coupling agent, a rubber composition intended for the manufacture of tires. In other words the reinforcing white filler is capable of replacing a conventional carbon black filler in its reinforcing function.<br>
Preferably, the reinforcing white filler is silica (SiO2) or alumina (AI2O3), or a mixture of these two fillers.<br>
The silica used may be any reinforcing silica known to the person skilled in the art, in particular any precipitated or pyrogenic silica having a BET surface area and a specific CTAB surface area both of which are less than 450 m2/g. The highly dispersable precipitated silicas are preferred, in particular when the invention is used to manufacture tires having a low rolling resistance. "Higly dispersible silica" is understood to mean any silica having a very substantial ability to disagglomerate and to disperse in a polymer matrix, which can be observed in known manner by electron or optical microscopy on thin sections. Non-limiting examples of such preferred highly dispersible silicas, include the silica Perkasil KS 430 (RTM) from Akzo, the silica BV 3380 (RTM) from Degussa, the silicas Zeosil 1165 MP (RTM) and Zeosil 1115 MP (RTM) from Rhone-Poulenc, the silica Hi-Sil 2000 (RTM) from PPG, the silicas Zeopol 8741 (RTM) or Zeopol 8745 (RTM) from Huber, and treated precipitated silicas such as, for example, the aluminium-"doped" silicas described in EP-A-0 735 088.<br>
Preferably, the reinforcing alumina is a highly dispersable alumina having a BET surface area from 30 to 400 m2/g, more preferably 80 to 250 m2/g, an average particle size of at most 500 nm, more preferably at most 200 nm, a high amount of reactive AI-OH surface functions, as described in EP-A-0 810 258. Non-limitative examples of such reinforcing aluminas are in particular the aluminas A125 (RTM), CR125 (RTM) and D65CR (RTM) of Baikowski.<br><br>
The physical state in which the reinforcing white filler is present is immaterial, whether it be in the form of a powder, microbeads, granules or balls. The "reinforcing white filler" is also understood to mean mixtures of different reinforcing white fillers, in particular highly disper-sible silicas and/or aluminas such as described above.<br>
The reinforcing white filler may also be used in a blend (mixture) with carbon black. Suitable carbon blacks are all the carbon blacks, in particular carbon blacks of the type HAF, ISAF or conventionally used in tires and, particularly, in treads for tires. Non-limiting examples of such blacks, include th blacks N115, N134, N234, N339, N347 and N375. The quantity of carbon black present in the total reinforcing filler may vary within wide limits, this quantity preferably being less than the quantity of reinforcing white filler present in the composition.<br>
Component (b) is usefully added to the elastomer in amounts of from 1 to 40%, for example from 1 to 30%, preferably from 5 to 30%, based on the weight of the elastomer.<br>
Component (c) is usefully added to the elastomer in amounts of from 0.01 to 10%, for example from 0.1 to 10%, preferably from 0.5 to 5%, based on the weight of the elastomer.<br>
In addition to components (a) and (b), the compositions of the invention may comprise further additives, such as the following:<br>

Preferred compositions of the invention comprise, as other additives, one or more components selected from the group consisting of pigments, dyes, levelling assistants, dispersants, plasticizers, vulcanization activators, vulcanization accelerators, vulcanizers, charge control agents, adhesion promoters, light stabilizers or antioxidants, such as phenolic antioxidants (items 1.1 to 1.18 in the list) or aminic antioxidants (item 1.19 in the list), organic phosphites or phosphonites (item 4 in the list) and/or thiosynergists (item 7 in the list).<br>
An example of the concentrations at which these other additives are added is from 0.01 to 10%, based on the total weight of the elastomer.<br>
Components (b) and (c), and also, if desired, other additives are incorporated into the elastomer by known methods, for example during mixing in internal mixers with rams (Banburry), on mixing rolls or in mixing extruders, prior to or during shaping or vulcanization, or else by applying dissolved or dispersed components (b) and (c) to the elastomer, if desired with subsequent removal of the solvent by evaporation. When added to the elastomer, components (b) and (c) and, if desired, other additives may also be in the form of a masterbatch comprising these, for example at a concentration of from 2.5 to 25% by weight.<br>
Components (b) and (c) and, if desired, other additives may also be added prior to or during the polymerization of synthetic elastomers or prior to crosslinking, i.e. advantageously, if desired, as a first-level mixture in the crude rubber, which may also comprise other components, such as carbon black as filler and/or extender oils.<br>
The compounds of the formula I are bonded chemically to polymer chains and the white reinforcing filler under processing conditions (mixing, vulcanization, etc.). The compounds of the formula I are resistant to extraction, i.e. they continue to offer good protection after the substrate is subjected to intensive extraction. The loss of compounds of the formula I from the elastomer via migration or extraction is extremely slight.<br><br>
Components (b) and (c) and, if desired, other additives may be in pure form or encapsulated in waxes, in oils or in polymers when they are incorporated into the elastomer to be treated.<br>
Components (b) and (c) and, if desired, other additives may also be sprayed onto the elastomer to be treated.<br>
The resultant elastomers may be used in a wide variety of forms, e.g. ribbons, moulding compositions, profiles, conveyor belts or tires (pneumatic).<br>
The present invention further provides a process for ensuring the coupling of a white reinforcing filler to elastomer compositions reinforced by a white filler, which comprises incorporating into the elastomer at least one component (c) and then vulcanizing the composition.<br>
A further embodiment of the present invention is the use of component (b) as coupling agent for ensuring the coupling of a white reinforcing filler with an elastomer.<br>
The preferred compounds of the formula I [component (c)] for the process and use listed above are the same as those for the compositions of the invention.<br>
The present invention further provides novel compounds of the formula la<br><br>

Example 7: Coupling of silica in a styrene-butadiene rubber.<br>
A basic compound containing 100 parts of SSBR [SSBR Nipol NS 210 (RTM); styrene-butadiene rubber from Nippon Zeon/Japan], 2.5 parts of ZnO and 1.5 parts of stearic acid is mixed on an open two roll mill at 60°C. The incorporation of the coupling agent according to Table 4 and the coupling reaction with 35 parts of silica silica [Ultrasil VN3 (RTM) from De-gussa] is conducted in a Brabender laboratory mixer with cam blades at 145°C. The torque at the cam blades and the stock temperature is recorded continuously. The curing system is subsequently added on the two roll mill at 60°C. The Rheometer curves are measured at 150°C. Rubber samples for testing are compression molded to T95 of the Rheometer curve at 150°C. In order to assess the coupling effect the following test have been conducted: Tensile test with ISO S 2 dumb-bells (DIN 53 504). Heat build up (Goodrich flexometer) according to ASTM D 623; and Compression set (recovered height) according to DIN 53 517.<br>
The elongation at break and the modulus 100 of the tensile test, the sample temperature after the Flexometer test and the recovered height are indications for coupling efficiency. The recorded torque during the Brabender mixing procedure and the TS2 value of the Rheometer curve indicates the scorch resistance of a coupling agent. The compounds of the formula I fulfil the high criteria as coupling agents for silica in a styrene-butadiene rubber. The results are summarized in Table 4.<br><br><br>
