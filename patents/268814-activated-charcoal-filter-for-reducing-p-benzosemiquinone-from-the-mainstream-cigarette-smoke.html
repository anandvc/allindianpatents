				<td>A FILTER FOR A TOBACCO SMOKE INHALING/GENERATING/PRODUCING<br>
DEVICE<br>
Filed of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to an activated charcoal based tobacco smoke filter device, for effectively reducing level of p-benzosemiquinone (p-BSQ) a highly reactive major harmful oxidant from the mainstream cigarette smoke while providing comfortable mouthful of smoke and nicotine delivery with considerable reduction in health risk-to the smokers. The said device also reduces other components of the tobacco smoke such as nitric oxide, nicotine etc.<br>
Background and prior art references<br>
Cigarette smoking is the world's single most preventable cause of disease and death.<br>
Worldwide, about 36 percent of all adults smoke cigarettes. According to a 1999 World Health Organization estimate, there are 4 million deaths a year from tobacco. Tobacco smoke contains more than 4000 compounds. Among these, nicotine is the habit forming pharmacological agent. Others are toxins, mutagens and carcinogens that cause or enhance various degenerative diseases including cancer of lung and other organs, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease such as bronchitis and emphysema as well as heart disease and stroke. Since approaches to cessation of smoking by public health campaigns and anti-smoking laws passed by local Governments have had limited success, the most practicable approach is the prevention of the hazardous effects caused by cigarette smoke. Modification of the cigarette is in itself a practical approach to reducing the toxic compounds contained in cigarette smoke. One of the approaches was to use cigarette filters. This is what the cigarette manufacturers have been trying to do for the last few decades.<br>
The cigarette companies have introduced cigarettes with filter tips to reduce the harmful compounds in the smoke, apparently to produce safer cigarettes without affecting the flavour and nicotine content of the smoke. There are four main types of filters in use today, namely, cellulose acetate, polypropylene, pure cellulose and filters containing granular additives, mainly activated charcoal (1). Cellulose acetate dominates the global filter market with 68 percent. Polypropylene filters follow with 21 percent (almost all of which are in China), charcoal filters comprise 10 percent and cellulose filters comprise less than 1 percent. Since it is difficult in selectively reducing specific compounds, the companies have focused on reducing the tar components, which is thought to contain the<br><br>
unaltered irrespective of whether the charcoal filters were present or replaced by similar length of<br>
conventional cellulose acetate filter.<br>
Although charcoal filters are commercially available, those are not effective in reducing the p-BSQ of the<br>
smoke. Nevertheless, this invention may be considered a re-evaluation and improvement of the existing state<br>
of art. Since activated charcoal not only adsorbs p-BSQ but also some tar and nicotine, the said charcoal filter<br>
cigarettes may be categorized as relatively low tar, low nicotine mild cigarettes. Apprehending that there<br>
might be some smokers who would not like mild cigarettes with low nicotine delivery, the tobacco of some<br>
of the said charcoal filter cigarettes will be fortified with nicotine to produce regular cigarettes with<br>
comparable nicotine content without any increase in the p-BSQ level of the smoke.<br>
Object of the invention<br>
The object of the present invention is to provide special activated charcoal filters mainly to reduce from the<br>
mainstream smoke p-benzosemiquinone (p-BSQ), a highly reactive major harmful oxidant, which is singly<br>
responsible for the oxidative damage of proteins and probably also DNA, thus conceived to pose the greatest<br>
health risk.<br>
Another object of the invention is to use stipulated amounts of specific grain sizes or mixture of specific<br>
grain sizes of activated charcoal to produce potentially less hazardous cigarettes, without significantly<br>
affecting the taste and flavour while providing comfortable mouthful of smoke and nicotine delivery.<br>
Still another object of the invention is that the said charcoal filter cigarettes should be acceptable to the<br>
smokers with marked reduction in health risk.<br>
Another object of the invention is to provide a filter device useful in reducing p-BSQ level, which can be<br>
used in any type of smoking device.<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a filter for a tobacco smoke inhaling/generating/producing<br>
device, the filter having three sections placed longitudinally one after another, comprising: a first section comprising cellulose acetate fiber acting as a mouth piece; a second section comprising requisite amounts of specific mesh sizes of activated charcoal selected from the group consisting of charcoal particles having mesh sizes of BS 44/52, BS 52/60, BS 60/72, BS 72/85, and any combinations thereof for effectively reducing p-benzosemiquinone, a highly reactive major harmful oxidant from the mainstream of said tobacco smoke; and a third section comprising cellulose acetate fiber located closer to a tobacco portion, also acting as a barrier between the activated charcoal and tobacco portion, wherein the activated charcoal is selected from the group consisting of 0.2 g of mesh size BS 44/52 and 0.1 g of mesh size BS 52/60, 0.2 g of mesh size BS 44/52 and 0.1 g of mesh size BS 60/72, 0.1 g of mesh size BS 44/52 and 0.1 g of mesh size BS 72/85, 0.2 g of mesh size BS 44/52 and 0.1 g of mesh size BS 72/85, 0.15 g of mesh size BS 44/52 and 0.1 g of mesh size BS 72/85, 0.1 g of mesh size BS 52/60 and 0.1 g of mesh size BS 60/72, 0.1 g of mesh size BS 52/60 and 0.1 g of mesh size BS 72/85, 0.1 g of mesh size BS 60/72 and 0.1 g of mesh size BS 72/85,0.1 g of mesh size BS 52/60 and 0.05 g of mesh size BS 72/85, and 0.1 g of mesh size BS 60/72 and 0.05 g of mesh size BS 72/85, and any combinations thereof.<br>
In accordance to the present invention provides a cigarette smoke filter comprising stipulated amounts of specific grain sizes or combination of grain sizes of activated charcoal for effectively reducing p-benzosemiquinone (p-BSQ)   from   the mainstream smoke without significantly affecting the taste and flavor while providing comfortable mouthful of smoke and nicotine delivery. p-BSQ is a relatively stable free radical and a<br>
highly reactive   major harmful oxidant present in the cigarette smoke, which is mainly<br>
responsible for the oxidative damage of proteins as well as DNA. The different grain sizes<br>
or combination of different grain sizes of activated charcoal have been selected from BS<br>
(British standard mesh) 25/44, 44/52, 52/60, 60/72, 72/85 and 85/100. The level of p-BSQ<br>
in the smoke from different charcoal filters cigarettes is reduced 55 to 85 percent, which is<br>
accompanied by inhibition of BSA oxidation to the extent of 55 to 82 percent. The<br>
charcoal filters also effectively reduce nitric oxide 44 to 68 percent and tar 10 to 50 percent<br>
from the mainstream smoke. Nicotine delivery, which is reduced to some extent by the<br>
charcoal filters, is replenished by fortification of the tobacco with nicotine without any<br>
increase in the p-BSQ level of the smoke, apparently because nicotine is not a precursor of<br>
p-BSQ.<br>

Construction of activated charcoal filter<br>
The activated charcoal filter was constructed by placing stipulated amounts of different grain sizes or mixture of grain sizes of activated charcoal in a thin plastic tube, the inside diameter of which was same as the outside diameter of the tobacco portion of the cigarette or the conventional cellulose acetate filter. The plastic tube could be replaced by tubes<br>
manufactured of light grade materials, namely hard paper tube, plastic wrapped paper tube or tube made with aluminium foil. At the one end of the tube containing the charcoal was inserted the conventional cellulose acetate filter (approximately 10 -  14 mm) which constitutes the mouthpiece and at the other end was inserted the tobacco portion of the cigarette (approximately 63 mm). A thin section of cellulose acetate filter (approximately 3 mm) was placed in the cavity in between the tobacco portion and charcoal bed as depicted in the drawing (Fig. 1). Essentially, the charcoal filter is a cavity filter where the activated charcoal granules are placed in a void space between two segments of cellulose acetate filters. As mentioned above, one portion of the cellulose acetate filter (l0 - 14 mm) is the mouthpiece and other portion (3 mm) constitutes a barrier between the charcoal bed and the tobacco portion (Fig. 1). The portions, namely, the cellulose acetate mouth piece, the charcoal filter, the thin cellulose acetate filter placed in between the charcoal and the tobacco portion and the tobacco portion all are constructed into one single unit (Fig. 1). The cellulose acetate filter does not necessarily improve the filtration of p-BSQ of the smoke. However, its use in cooperation with the charcoal filter adds to the convenience of using it as a mouthpiece for suction. The thin section of the cellulose acetate filter placed in between the charcoal and the tobacco portion was used to prevent any infiltration of charcoal granules into the tobacco of the cigarette. The length of the charcoal packed in the filter corresponded approximately to the weight of the charcoal used. The weight to length proportion was usually 100 mg charcoal corresponding to 5 mm, 200 mg charcoal, 20 mm and so on. The total length of a charcoal filter cigarette using 300 mg of charcoal is 91 mm [10 mm cellulose acetate filter as a mouthpiece, 15 mm charcoal bed, 3 mm cellulose acetate as a partition between charcoal bed and tobacco portion and 63 mm tobacco portion]. The length of the cellulose acetate may be varied, because it is practically ineffective in reducing p-BSQ of the smoke. The grain size of charcoal used has been expressed in the British Standard (BS) mesh. The size BS 25/44 means particles passing through mesh 25 but retained on mesh 44. Similarly, BS 44/25 means particles passing through mesh 44 but retained on mesh 52. All other grain sizes used in this invention, namely BS 52/60, 60/72 and 72/85 are explained in the same way.   The length of the charcoal filter can be varied up to 35 mm, length of conventional filter i.e. cellulose acetate filter can be up to 13 mm for cigarette tobacco length of about 63 mm. (Table 4)<br>
Measurement of p-benzosemiquinone (p-BSQ)<br>
p-BSQ was quantitatively measured by HPLC as described before (5). Five to ten micro<br>
liters of the filtered smoke solution was diluted with mobile phase and 20 µl of this diluted<br>
solution was injected to the HPLC column with the UV detector set at 294 nm. The<br>
parameters used are as follows.<br>
Instrument	: Simadzu l0A<br>
Column	: Silica column (Lichrospher ® Si60, Merck)<br>
Mobile phase	: Methylene chloride : methanol (90 : 10, v/v)<br>
Flow rate	: 0.5 ml / min<br>
Pressure	29Kgf/cm2<br>
Retention time	: 8.808<br>
The amount of p-BSQ present in the smoke solution was calculated from the peak area,<br>
taking 100 ng of p-BSQ corresponding to an arbitrary area of 1,90,000 obtained from a<br>
standard curve.<br>
The  efficacy  of activated  charcoal   filters  was   also  determined  by  measuring  the<br>
comparative yields of p-BSQ. p-BSQ was isolated from cigarette smoke solution by<br>
fractional solvent extraction followed by band TLC as described before (5). After proper<br>
dilution of the TLC band extract with the mobile phase, 20µl of the diluted solution was<br>
injected to the HPLC column. p-BSQ was   detected at 288 nm, which is the Xmax of p-<br>
BSQ in the mobile phase used. The parameters used are as follows.<br>
Instrument	:	Simadzu l0A<br>
Column	:	Lichrospher ® 100 RP-18 endcapped (5µm), Merck<br>
Mobile phase	:	Water : methanol (95 : 5, v /v)<br>
Flow rate	:	0.5 ml / min<br>
Pressure	:	38Kgf/cm2<br>
Retention time	:	7.242 min<br>
Measurement of oxidative damage of proteins<br>
Protein oxidation as evidenced by carbonyl formation was measured by reaction with 2,4-<br>
dinitrophenyl hydrazine similar to that done before in our laboratory (4). When BSA was<br>
used, the values were expressed as nmoles of carbonyl formed per mg BSA. The<br>
incubation system contained 1 mg BSA and 50 µ1 of smoke solution obtained from<br>
cigarettes with or without charcoal filter in a final volume of 200 µl of 50mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. After incubation for 1 hr. at 37°C, the protein was precipitated with 200 111 of trichloroacetic acid solution and the rest of the procedure followed as before (4). Oxidative damage of proteins was also measured by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) of guinea lung microsomal proteins as described before (4). Preparation of microsomes<br>
Guinea pig lung microsomes, washed free of ascorbic acid, were prepared as described before (4).<br>
Sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) SDS-PAGE of microsomal proteins was performed by the procedures similar to that described before (4). Measurement of nicotine<br>
Smoke from a lit cigarette was allowed to dissolve in 2 ml of 50mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4 and filtered through 0.45 µm Millipore filter as described before (5). One milliliter of the yellow coloured filtrate was extracted with one milliliter of methylene chloride by vigorous vortexing to extract the nicotine in the methylene chloride layer. Five hundred microliter of the methylene chloride layer containing the nicotine was then vortexed with 500 µl of 50 mM HCl solution and the nicotine of the HCl solution was estimated by HPLC analysis at 254 nm. Five to 10 µl of the nicotine solution was diluted to 200 µl with the mobile phase and 20 µlof this diluted solution was injected to the HPLC column. A standard solution of nicotine was prepared in a similar way and analyzed. The parameters used are:<br>
Instrument	:	Shimadzu l0A<br>
Column	:	Lichrospher® 100 RP-18 endcapped (5 µm), Merck<br>
Mobile phase	:	50 mM KH2PO4 solution: accetonitrile : methanol;<br>
(78 : 17 : 5, v/v) containing 1 mM<br>
sodium hepatane sulfonate, pH 5.0<br>
Flow rate	:	0.3 ml / min<br>
Pressure	:	24Kgf/cm2<br>
Temperature	:	250C<br>
Retention time	:	4.185 min.<br>
The minimum amount of nicotine that could be detected by the HPLC analysis under the<br>
conditions was 10 ng.<br>
Measurement of tar<br>
Tar was collected by placing a Millipore filter unit between the lit cigarette with or without<br>
charcoal filter and the tube connected to a vacuum pump (LKB, Sweden) using a suction of<br>
30cm water. The Millipore filter (0.22 µm) was changed every two minutes to avoid<br>
clogging of the filter. For each cigarette, 4 filters were used. After complete burning of the<br>
tobacco, the filters were dried in a vacuum desiccator and weighed. The difference in<br>
weight of the filters before and after collecting the particulate portion was the weight of the<br>
tar.<br>
Measurement of nitric oxide in cigarette smoke solution<br>
Ten milliliter of air saturated 50-mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4 was taken in a 50<br>
ml boiling tube with a side arm and a stopper with a hole. An Indian commercial cigarette<br>
was mounted in a tube that penetrated the hole in the stopper and dipped down in the<br>
buffer solution. The side arm was connected to a water pump. The cigarette was lit and the<br>
smoke from the whole cigarette was bubbled through the buffer solution by applying a<br>
suction of 4 cm water. A portion of the cigarette smoke solution thus produced was filtered<br>
through a 0.45 µm Millipore filter and extracted thrice with equal volume of methylene<br>
chloride. The concentration of potassium nitrite in the aqueous layer was measured after<br>
proper dilution by diazotization using Griess regent. A standard solution of NaNO2 was run<br>
side by side.<br>
Exposure of guinea pigs to cigarette smoke<br>
The exposure of the animals to cigarette smoke was done according to a procedure<br>
standardized in our laboratory (19). The guinea pigs were grouped as follows:<br>
Group 1: Control guinea pigs<br>
Group 2: Guinea pigs subjected to smoke from cigarettes without charcoal filter<br>
Group 3: Guinea pigs subjected to smoke from cigarettes equipped with activated charcoal<br>
filter containing a mixture of 0.1 g of BS 52/60 and 0.lg of BS 60/72.<br>
The animals were exposed to cigarette smoke from five cigarettes /animal/day for seven<br>
days following the procedure published before (19). The animals were fasted overnight,<br><br>
sacrificed on the eighth day, tissue excised, microsomes prepared and subsequently subjected to SDS-PAGE as described earlier (19).<br>
Results<br>
Effects of charcoal filters on the p-BSQ, tar and nicotine contents of the mainstream<br>
smoke as well as inhibition of protein oxidation<br>
Using charcoal filter comprising stipulated amounts of different grain sizes or mixture of grain sizes of activated charcoal, the p-BSQ contents of the mainstream smoke are markedly reduced (Table 1). We have indicated before (5) that among all the compounds present in the smoke solution, only p-BSQ is singly responsible for protein oxidation. Fig. 2  shows  that  oxidation  of BSA,  as  evidenced  by  carbonyl  formation,  is  almost quantitatively correlated with the contents of p-BSQ present in the incubation medium. As would be expected, reduction of p-BSQ content in the smoke by the use of charcoal filter is accompanied by marked inhibition of BSA oxidation (Table 1). Use of charcoal filter also results in reduction of some tar and nicotine (Table 1). The most effective grain sizes of activated charcoal, expressed in British Standard (BS) mesh, are 44/52, 52/60, 60/72 and 72/85 used singly or in combination. Grain sizes larger than 44/52, namely 25/44 and 10/25 are not efficient even when used in comparatively large amounts. Use of large amounts of charcoal (0.4 g to 1.0 g) causes problem in suction of the smoke. Use of coconut shell activated charcoal did not have any added advantage over commercially available activated charcoal. The most effective charcoal filters, those markedly reduce p-BSQ content in the smoke without significantly affecting the suction and providing comfortable mouthful of smoke, as evidenced by a panel of middle aged smokers, are given in the Table 1. The charcoal filters comprise 0.2 and 0.3 g of BS 44/52, 0.2 and 0.3 g of BS 52/60, 0.15 and 0.2 g of BS 60/72, 0.1 and 0.15 g of BS 72/85, a mixture of 0.2 g of BS 44/52 and 0.1 g of BS 52/60, a mixture of 0.2 g of BS 44/52 and 0.1 g of BS 60/72, a mixture of 0.1 g of BS 44/52 and 0.1 g of BS 72/85, a mixture of 0.2g of BS 44/52 and 0.1 g of BS 72/85, a mixture of 0.15 g of BS 44/52 and 0.1 g of BS 72/85, a mixture of 0.1 g of BS 52/60 and 0.1 g of BS 60/72, a mixture of 0.1 g of BS 52/60 and 0.1 g of 72/85, and a mixture of 0.1 g of BS 60/72 and 0.1 g of BS 72/85, a mixture of 0.1 g of BS 52/60 and 0.05 g of BS 72/85, and a mixture of 0.1 g of BS 60/72 and 0.05 g of BS 72/85.. With the<br>
said charcoal filters, reduction of p-BSQ was in the range of 55 to 85 percent, with a corresponding inhibition of BSA oxidation was in the range of 55 to 82 percent. Effect of fortification of tobacco of the charcoal filter cigarettes with nicotine on the p-BSQ, tar and nicotine delivery of the smoke from an Indian commercial cigarette<br>
Table 1 shows that the charcoal filter cigarettes mentioned in this invention are very effective for markedly reducing the content of p-BSQ, the major hazardous oxidant present in the mainstream smoke. Table 1 further shows that the tar and nicotine delivery of these charcoal filter cigarettes are also considerably reduced. These charcoal filter cigarettes may therefore be considered as potentially safer mild cigarette. Apprehending that there might be some committed smokers who would not like mild cigarette with low nicotine delivery, the tobacco of some of the charcoal filter cigarettes has been fortified with 2 mg nicotine per cigarette and the results are given in Table 2. The results indicate that fortification of tobacco with 2 mg nicotine per cigarette lead to increase the nicotine delivery of the smoke considerably. The increase in nicotine delivery is accompanied by increase in tar content (Table 2). Fortification of tobacco with 3-4 mg nicotine produces about 30 - 50 percent more nicotine delivery (results not shown). However, fortification of tobacco with nicotine does not lead to any increase of p-BSQ content of the smoke, apparently because nicotine is not a precursor of p-BSQ and it does not contribute to either the level of p-BSQ in smoke or oxidation of BSA by the smoke solution (Table 2). The results would indicate that although fortification of tobacco with nicotine of the charcoal filter cigarettes results in increased nicotine delivery, but the said charcoal filter cigarettes remain potentially safer cigarettes.<br>
Effects of charcoal filters on the nitric oxide level in the smoke solution from an Indian commercial cigarette<br>
Nitric oxide (NO) is one of the most important free radicals in the gas phase of cigarette smoke. Some scientists think that NO may be implicated in the development of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and emphysema in the smokers. Results presented in Table 3 indicates that activated charcoal filter is very effective in reducing the NO level in the mainstream smoke. Using a mixture 0.2 g of BS 44/52 and 0.1 g of BS 72/85, the percent inhibition in the NO is as high as 68.<br>
Protective effect of charcoal filters on the cigarette smoke induced oxidative degradation of guinea pig lung microsomal proteins in vitro<br>
Fig. 3 (lane 2) shows that cigarette smoke solution obtained from an Indian commercial cigarette causes extensive damage of guinea pig lung microsomal proteins as evidenced by SDS-PAGE. The figure further shows that the oxidative damage of microsomal proteins is markedly reduced when the said cigarette was equipped with activated charcoal filters, namely, BS 52/60, 0.3 g (lane 3); a mixture of BS 44/52, 0.2g and BS 72/85, O.lg (lane 4); a mixture of BS 60/72, O.lg and BS 72/85, O.lg (lane 5).<br>
Protective effect of charcoal filter on the cigarette smoke induced oxidative damage of guinea pig lung microsomal proteins in vivo<br>
Fig 4 (lane 2) shows that after exposure of the guinea pigs to cigarette smoke, lung microsomal proteins are discemibly damaged, as evidenced by SDS-PAGE. The oxidative damage is significantly protected when the animals are exposed to smoke from cigarettes equipped with activated charcoal filter containing a mixture of O.lg of BS 52/60 and O.lg of BS 60/72.<br>
