				<td>The present invention relates to a process for the recovery of chromium from chromite<br>
ore at low temperatures. The process of reduction can be affected using a furnace. This<br>
invention will be useful for reducing chromite ore at temperature significantly lower than<br>
that conventionally used for reducing the ore,<br>
Chromite ore is conventionally reduced in the submerged-arc furnace where the<br>
temperature varies from a low of about 500 °C at the top of the charge bed to about 2500<br>
°C at the tip of the electrodes. In this process, a mixture of about 72-78 wt% chromite ore;<br>
15-22 wt% coke or coal and 4-7 wt% of flux such as quartzite is charged to the furnace.<br>
The chromite ore is reduced in the furnace and liquid ferro-chromium is tapped at the<br>
bottom at regular intervals. In US patent No.4981510, reduction of the ore is carried out<br>
in rotary kilns at temperatures above 1400 °C. In this case, a mixture of ore and coal in<br>
the ratio of 1:0.4 to 1:2 is charged into a rotary furnace and heated to 1480-1580 °C for<br>
20-240 minutes. This partially reduced (ore+metal) mixture, also called as 'pre-reduced<br>
ore' is charged to the submerged-arc furnace to produce ferro-chromium. In S.A Patent<br>
No.8.410.101, highly reduced chromium pellets has been produced by a process using<br>
large excess of reducing agent.<br>
Reference may be made to N. S. Sundar Murti and V. Seshadri: Transactions of the<br>
Indian Institute of Metals, Vol.38, No.5, October 1985, pp.423-425, wherein the<br>
reduction of a chromite ore containing 17.85% Fe, 38.15% Cr, 3.50% Si and 7.64% Mg<br>
with graphite was carried out. Reduction was conducted in the temperature range 1240-<br>
1310°C. 15% and 25%, by weight, of carbon were used in the different runs. The authors<br>
have reported the cumulative percentage of reduction. It is known from various studies<br>
(for example: W.J. Rankin: Trans. Inst. Min. Metall. C, June 1979, Vol.88, C107-C113)<br>
that up to about 1200° C, only iron oxide is reduced in the chromite ore. Above this<br>
temperature, chromium oxide gets reduced. Iron oxide is almost completely reduced<br>
before the oxide of chromium gets reduced as shown by B.M.C. Tsomondo, D.J.Simbi<br>
and E.Navara, Ironmaking and Stelmaking,1997, 24(5), pp.386- 391; by P. Weber and<br>
R.H. Eric: Metallurgical TransactionsB, Vol.24B, December 1993, pp.987-995; by A.<br>
Lekatou and R. D. Walker, Iron and Steelmaking, 1995, Vol.22, No.5, pp.393-404; by K.<br>
P. D. Perry, C. W. P. Finn and R. P. King: Met. Trans. B, Vol.l9B, August 1988,<br>
pp.677-684; by O. Soykan, R. H. Eric and R. P. King, Met. Trans. B, Vol. 22B,<br>
December 1991, pp.801-810; by A. Lekatou and R. D. Walker, Iron and Steelmaking,<br>
1995, Vol.22, No.5, pp.378-392 and by W.J.Rankin, Arch. Eisenhuttenwesen, 50(9),<br>
1979, pp. 373-378. Therefore, wherever the investigators have not given the extent of<br>
recovery of iron and chromium separately, it is assumed that all the iron gets reduced<br>
before chromium is reduced. From this, the extent of recovery of chromium is inferred. In<br>
the study of N. S. Sundar Murti and V. Seshadri: Transactions of the Indian Institute of<br>
Metals, Vol.38, No.5, October 1985, pp.423-425, it is found that a maximum chromium<br>
recovery of 5.22% was obtained at 1240 °C after 35 minutes of reaction. Chromium<br>
recovery, (Cr)R is defined as the ratio of the amount of chromium reduced to the total<br>
present in the ore expressed as a percentage:<br>
(Cr)R = (metallic chromium in the partly reduced sample / total chromium in the ore)* i 00<br>
The level of recovery remained unchanged after this period. N. A. Barcza, P. R. Jochens,<br>
and D. D. Howat: Electric furnace proceedings, 1971, pp.88-93 found that no reduction of<br>
chromite occurred at temperatures less than 1000° C. They studied the reduction of<br>
chromite in the temperature 1100-1500° C. A maximum rate of reduction about 70% was<br>
obtained at 1300° C. The rate of reduction remained constant with time after an initial rise<br>
up to about 20 minutes. There was a decrease in the rate of reduction after the maximum<br>
rate had been reached. This study also showed that C^Os was not reduced under CO gas<br>
but was reduced when carbon was present along with CO. These authors also have reported<br>
cumulative reduction. Using the method employed in the previous case, it is deducted that<br>
in this study the recovery of chromium was 63% at 1300 °C after 30 minutes. This level<br>
remained unchanged after this. Downing, Electric furnace proceedings, 1971, pp.88-93<br>
noted that unless the CO gas was extremely pure, it would not reduce the chromite. W.J.<br>
Rankin: Trans. Inst. Min. Metall. C, June 1979, Vol.88, C107-C113,studied the Kroondal<br>
mine ore of Transvaal in South Africa. The ore was mixed with graphite in the mass ratio<br>
7:3. The ore and the reductant were crushed to 150-170 mesh before mixing. The ore was<br>
treated to remove gangue. The composition of the ore and that of the chromite are given in<br>
table 1. Reduction studies were also carried out in a stream of CO in contact with graphite.<br>
The studies were carried out in the temperature range of 1100°C-1500°C. The reduction<br>
sequence involved formation of Fe and Cr203 up to 1200°C. Above this temperature, iron<br>
A series of ores from Greek and Cypriot were investigated by H. G. Vazarlis and A.<br>
Lekatou, Ironmaking and Steelmakmg, 1993, Vol.20, No.l, pp.42-53. The chemical<br>
compositions of the various ores studied are given in Table 2. Metallurgical coke and lignite<br>
from different sources were used as the reducing agent. In some cases, carbon monoxide and<br>
hydrogen were used as reducing agent. The ground ore and reductant were thoroughly mixed<br>
in a vibratory device and introduced into a furnace in an alumina boat. Argon was used for<br>
maintaining an inert atmosphere. The experiments were carried out in the temperature range<br>
1200-1500°C. Since pure hydrogen and carbon monoxide failed to reduce the Greek and<br>
Cypriot chromites, it was argued that reduction was carried out by solid carbon.<br>
Note : S.A.- South African Chromite.<br>
Reductants with higher fixed carbon content were superior reducing agents. Increase in<br>
temperature increased the rate of reduction. The rate of reduction increased with progress<br>
of time and then it dropped. A. Lekatou and R. D. Walker, Iron and Steelmaking, 1995,<br>
Vol.22, No.5, pp.393-404, studied the solid state reduction of chromite ore from the<br>
Skoumtsa area of Greece, in the temperature range 1100°C-1470°C. The composition of<br>
the ore is given in table 3. Natural graphite, -45fj,m size, was used as reductant. Briquettes<br>
of 1cm diam. were prepared from these. Graphite was taken in stoichiometric quantity<br>
required for the reduction of Cr2O3 to Cr7C3 and iron oxides to Fe3C. Experiments were<br>
carried out in a tubular furnace. It was demonstrated that CO was the only gaseous<br>
reaction product. The maximum metallisation was 91% and 67% for iron and chromium,<br>
respectively for a reduction of 75%. Analysis of the samples reduced at different<br>
temperatures and time periods showed that at low percentage reduction (up to 25%). Fe-C<br>
alloy formed. Occasionally Fe3C was formed. This was followed by the formation of<br>
(Cr,Fe)?C3 which was the main metallization product up to 72% reduction. At 46%<br>
reduction, Cr23Ce was detected which remained at advanced levels of reduction. The<br>
percentage reduction increased with time, temperature, and carbon content. At any given<br>
temperature, there was an optimum time and carbon addition after which no further<br>
increase in reduction occurred.<br>
Ralph H. Nafziger, Jack E. Tress and Jack I.Paige: Metallurgical Transactions B,<br>
Vol. 10B, March 1979, pp.5-14, studied the reduction of two types of chromite ores using<br>
•<br>
different reducing agents such as coal char, metallurgical coke, petroleum coke etc. The<br>
experiments were carried out in a horizontal tubular furnace in the temperature range<br>
1100° C-15000 C. The size of the chromite ore was 100/200 mesh and the reductant was -<br>
100 mesh size. The quantity of reductant taken was 109% of the stoichioimetric amount<br>
required to reduce iron oxide to metallic iron and chromium oxide to chromium carbide.<br>
Argon was used for maintaining an inert atmosphere.<br>
Nafziger et.al R. H. Nafziger, P. E. Sanker, J. E. Tress and R. A. McCune: Ironmaking and<br>
Steelmaking, 1982, Vol.9. No.6, pp.267-277, studied the reduction of four chromite ores from<br>
mines in Montana and California. They used a rotary kiln to carry out the studies. Samples were<br>
withdrawn at different temperatures as the charge moved down the kiln and the extent of<br>
metallization was estimated. They pelletized the ores with coal char and/or coke breeze. They<br>
used 125% and 150% of the carbon requirement for the formation of Cr?C3 and Fe by reduction<br>
of the ore. A temperature of 1150 °C was required for iron reduction. The ores ground to -65<br>
mesh were blended with -150 mesh coal char. 5% bentonite binder was used. The pellets were<br>
about 0.6 cm diameter. These authors observed a maximum chromium recovery of 50-60%<br>
which was achieved at 1300 °C after 200 minutes of traverse through the kiln.<br>
0. Soykan, R. H.Eric and R. P. King, Met. Trans. B, Vol. 22B, February 1991, pp.53-63,<br>
studied the reduction of chromite from Bushveld, South Africa at 1416°C. Finely divided<br>
ore and graphite were used in this study. The amount of graphite used was 30% in excess<br>
of the amount required to produce the carbide C^Cs from the ore. XRD analysis of the<br>
reduced sample showed that Fe?C3 was a reaction product from about 27.5% reduction.<br>
Table 6 summarises the degree of chromium metallisation obtained by various<br>
investigators as a function of temperature and time.<br>
This table shows that the extent of chromium recovery at any temperature and time of<br>
holding depends on the source of the ore and the nature of the reducing agent. It is seen<br>
that significant levels of recovery are obtained at 1300 °C and above. These studies have<br>
investigated the effect of time and temperature on the extent of chromium recovery&gt; the<br>
influence of factors such as the flow arte of inert gas has not been studied.<br>
The conventional processes for the reduction of chromite ore suffer from various<br>
draw-backs. In the submerged-arc furnace, heat required for the reduction reaction is<br>
supplied through electric power which is converted to heat by the resistance of the<br>
charged material. Since the cost of electric power is very high, the cost of reduction is,<br>
consequently, very high in this process. In the conventional rotary kiln process for the<br>
pre-reduction of the ore, it is necessary to heat the charge material to at least 1400 °C , in<br>
order to effect reduction. This leads to large energy cost and also affects the equipment<br>
through high refractory wear at high temperatures. Further, the temperatures cause a<br>
softening of the pellets making it difficult to charge these in the submerged-arc furnace. It<br>
is very difficult to maintain a balance between reduction and softening.<br>
The main objective of the present invention is to provide a process for the reduction of<br>
chromite ore at low temperatures.<br>
Another objective of the present invention is to provide a process for the reduction of<br>
chromite ore at low temperatures with a significant recovery of chromium.<br>
In the figures accompanying this application, fig.l, represents the experimental<br>
apparatus used for carrying out the reduction studies. Fig.2 represents the quartz capsules<br>
used as the container for the ore which was reduced in the furnace.<br>
Reduction of chromite ore in submerged-arc furnace is expensive since the cost of<br>
electric power is high. Partial reduction of the ore outside the submerged-arc<br>
fumace(SAF) can reduce the cost in the SAF. However, the conventional processes of<br>
pre-reduction of the ore outside the SAF is carried out at 1400 °C or above under normal<br>
atmospheric conditions and is still expensive and inefficient due to pellet softening<br>
because of the high temperatures involved.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a process for the recovery of chromium from<br>
chromite ore at low temperatures which comprises:<br>
(a) preparing a mixture of chromite ore and a reducing agent,<br>
(b) placing the above said mixture in a furnace,<br>
(c) passing a stream of an inert gas through the above said furnace<br>
containing the above said mixture at a rate of 0.016-7 lit/minute,<br>
(d) heating the above said mixture at a temperature ranging between<br>
1100-1250 °C for a period of 30-180 minutes followed by<br>
discharging from the furnace and<br>
(e) recovering the desired chromium from the mixture by known<br>
method.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention the chromite ore used is selected from the<br>
following composition: Cr 20-40%; Fe 10-30%; SiO2 15-30%; MgO 2-4%; A1203 2-<br>
4%.<br>
In yet another embodiment the reducing agent used is selected from coke and coal.<br>
In still another embodiment the inert gas used is selected from argon and helium.<br>
In the present invention, passing a stream of inert gas like argon reduces the partial<br>
pressure of carbon monoxide. This facilitates faster reduction of the ore. The extent of<br>
reduction achieved at a given temperature and time interval was equivalent to that<br>
achieved at a higher temperature when argon was not passed.At a temperature of 1250 °C,<br>
up to 38% of the chromium in the ore could be recovered as metal.<br>
The novelty of the investigations is that using a flowing stream of inert gas at appropriate<br>
flow rate has enhanced the recovery of chromium. This has helped in bringing down the<br>
temperature of reduction for obtaining good recovery of metallic chromium, compared to<br>
the conventional processes.<br>
The following examples of the process are given by way of illustration and should not be<br>
construed to limit the scope of the present invention.<br>
The following examples are results of experiments carried out in the laboratory. In these<br>
experiments a tubular furnace 90 mm in diameter and 500 mm length was used. This<br>
furnace is called the main furnace. The furnace was resistance-heated. A recrystallised<br>
alumina tube was kept inside the furnace. One end of this tube was connected to a similar<br>
tube kept inside another furnace (called the auxiliary furnace), through ground glass<br>
joints. The auxiliary furnace contained coke maintained at 800 °C. The other end of the<br>
tube in the auxiliary furnace was connected to a cylinder of argon through a rotameter to<br>
measure the flow rate of the gas. The gas from the rotameter was passed through a train of<br>
CaCh, before entering the alumina tube of the auxiliary furnace. The other end of the<br>
main furnace tube was connected to the atmosphere through a train of CaCb and KOH<br>
solution to dry the gas and reduce the amount of CO in the exit gas. The experimental<br>
apparatus is illustrated in fig.l. In a typical experiment 10 gms. of the ore was mixed with<br>
4 gms. of coke, both ground to a size of-150 mesh ( 0.1125 mm). The mixture was taken<br>
in a quartz capsule closed at both ends. The capsule measured 82 mm in length and 20<br>
mm in diameter. Two holes, each approximately 3 mm diameter were made on the curved<br>
surface of the capsule, one at each end of the capsule. Both the holes were on the same<br>
line parallel to the axis. The mixture was introduced into the capsule through these holes.<br>
)o<br>
Fig.2 illustrates the capsule used in the experiments. The mass of the empty capsule and<br>
that after addition of the charge was noted. The capsule was positioned at the center of the<br>
alumina tube in the main furnace. This tube was closed airtight using ground glass joints.<br>
The auxiliary furnace containing coke was also closed similarly. Argon was passed<br>
through the apparatus at the desired flow rate. Power supply to the auxiliary furnace was<br>
then switched on. When this furnace reached a temperature of 800 °C, power to the main<br>
furnace was switched on. This furnace was then heated to the desired temperature and<br>
maintained at the temperature for a pre-determined time interval. At the end of this<br>
period, power to both the furnaces was switched off simultaneously. The sample in the<br>
furnace was allowed to cool down to room temperature in the stream of argon flowing<br>
through the apparatus. After cooling to room temperature, the quartz capsule containing<br>
the (ore+coke) mixture was withdrawn from the furnace and weighed. The sample was<br>
analyzed for metallic chromium and metallic iron. A few experimental samples were<br>
studied using XRD. Temperatures were measured using chromel-alumel (type K)<br>
thermocouples. Ore/coke ratio, temperature, time and argon flow rate were varied during<br>
the course of this study. The influence of these parameters on the reducibility of the ore<br>
was studied. In preliminary runs, 10 gms of the coke was taken in the quartz capsule<br>
without any ore and maintained at 1200 C in the furnace in the presence of argon. The<br>
coke sample was maintained this for 120 minutes. At the end of this period, the sample<br>
was cooled in the furnace to room temperature, under argon. The sample was later<br>
withdrawn and the mass of the (capsule +coke) was measured. There was a loss of mass<br>
of the coke by about 50%. The empty quartz capsule did not register any change in mass.<br>
This is recorded in table A, below, for a few typical cases.<br>
M2- mass of coke after experiment<br>
F.R. - flow rate of argon<br>
The ore used in the study analysed 29.9%Cr, 16.09%Fe, 23.01% SiO2, 2.47%MgO,<br>
2.38%Al2O3. The following schedules of experiments illustrate the recovery of metallic<br>
chromium for different conditions. The recovery is defined by:<br>
(Cr)R = (metallic chromium in the partly reduced sample / total chromium in the ore) 100<br>
Metallic iron was analyzed in some of the samples. This analyzed to be about 50% of the<br>
total iron in the ore. A good part of the reduced iron is present as the carbide, FesC in the<br>
partly reduced ore. This was confirmed by XRD analysis. This is consistent with<br>
information available in literature. Metallic iron and metallic chromium were analysed in<br>
the samples using wet chemical methods. In the following examples:<br>

recovery (32.92%) of chromium could be obtained after a holding time of 1 hour.<br>
Example 6<br>
10 gms of the ore was mixed with 4 gms. of coke and heated at 1200 °C for a period<br>
of 1-4 hours. Argon was passed at a rate of 0.016-7 lit/min. The change in the mass of the<br>
sample during the experiment and the recovery of chromium are given in the table below.<br>
Maximum recovery of chromium obtained was at a flow rate of 51it/min. of argon. The<br>
holding tome was 5 hrs.<br>
Example 7<br>
10 gms of the ore was mixed with 12 gms. of coke and heated at 1200 °C for a<br>
period of 1 hour. Argon was passed at a rate of 0.125-3 lit/min. The change in the mass of<br>
the sample during the experiment and the recovery of chromium are given in the table<br>
below. Maximum recovery of chromium was obtained at a flow rate of argon of 31it/min.<br>
Example 8<br>
10 gms of the ore was mixed with 4 gms. of coke and heated at 1250 C for a period of<br>
1 -3 hours. Argon was passed at a rate of 1 lit/min. The change in the mass of the sample<br>
during the experiment and the recovery of chromium are given in the table below.<br>
Maximum recovery was obtained at a holding time of 3 hours.<br>
Example 9<br>
10 gms of the ore was mixed with 8 gms. of coke and heated at 1250 C for a period of<br>
1-3 hours. Argon was passed at a rate of 1-2 lit/min. The change in the mass of the sample<br>
during the experiment and the recovery of chromium are given in the table below.<br>
Maximum recovery of chromium(38.47%) was obtained at a flow rate of argon of 2<br>
lit/min. after a holding time of 3 hours.<br>
Example 10<br>
10 gms of the ore was mixed with 12 gms. of coke and heated at 1250 C for a period<br>
of 1 hour. Argon was passed at a rate of 0.125-3 lit/min. The change in the mass of the<br>
sample during the experiment and the recovery of chromium are given in the table below.<br>
Maximu recovery of chromium was obtained at a flow rate of argon of 2 lit/min.<br>
Holding time is the period for which the sample was maintained at the experimental<br>
temperature. It is seen from the tables above that the recovery increases with the holding<br>
time. The recovery increases with decrease in the (ore/coke) ratio. The recovery of<br>
chromium increases with increase in flow rate of argon. However, the recovery decreases<br>
after a certain optimum flow rate. This optimum flow rate depends on factors such as the<br>
temperature of reduction, the holding time and the ore/coke ratio. Recovery does not<br>
increase monotonously with increasing flow rate of inert gas since the actual reduction<br>
reaction is made of two steps: the oxidation of carbon by CO2 and the reduction of the ore<br>
by CO. The examples reported here have established the optimum flow rate for different<br>
conditions of experimentation, the other parameters being varied being the temperature,<br>
the ore/coke ratio and the holding time. The chromium recovery reported is based on the<br>
chemical analysis of the reduced sample for metallic chromium. However, a part of the<br>
chromium is converted into the carbide during reduction. This is not included in the<br>
reported recovery. Though the examples given here report on one type of ore, the present<br>
invention is not limited to this ore. These data are given here as examples to illustrate the<br>
influence of various parameters on the recovery of chromium and should not be construed<br>
to limit the scope of the present invention. It is seen from the examples given above that<br>
about 38% chromium can be recovered at 1250 °C at a flow rate of argon of 2 1/min. after<br>
keeping the sample at this temperature for 180 minutes.<br>
The advantages of the process are:<br>
(1) It can reduce the chromite ore and recover significant proportion of chromium at<br>
low temperatures, compared to the conventional processes for the pre-reduction of<br>
these ores. This saves energy required for reduction.<br>
(2) It enhances the life of the refractory used in the furnaces used for pre-reduction.<br>
(3) Pre-reduction facility can be added to exiting manufacturing units where preheating<br>
is already being carried out, with minimum capital expenditure.<br>
(4) The process gives a chromium recovery rate of 38%.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
We claim:<br>
(1) A process for the recovery of chromium from chromite ore at low temperatures<br>
which comprises:<br>
(a) preparing a mixture of chromite ore and a reducing agent,<br>
(b) placing the above said mixture in a furnace,<br>
(c) passing a stream of an inert gas through the above said furnace containing<br>
the above said mixture at a rate of 0.016-7 lit/minute,<br>
(d) heating the above said mixture at a temperature ranging between 1100-<br>
1250 °C for a period of 30-180 minutes followed by discharging from the<br>
furnace and<br>
(e) recovering the desired chromium from the mixture by known method.<br>
(2) A process as claimed in claim 1, wherein the chromite ore used is selected from<br>
the following composition: Cr 20-40%; Fe 10-30%; SiO2 15-30%; MgO 2-4%;<br>
Al2O32-4%.<br>
(3) A process as claimed in claims 1&amp;2, wherein the reducing agent used is selected<br>
from coke and coal.<br>
(4) A process as claimed in claims 1-3, wherein the inert gas used is selected from<br>
argon and helium.<br>
(5) A process for reduction of chromium from chromite ore at low temperature,<br>
substantially as herein described with reference to examples and drawing<br>
accompanying this specification<br><br></td>
