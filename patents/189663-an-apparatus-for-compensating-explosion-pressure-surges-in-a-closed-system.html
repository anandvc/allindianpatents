The  invention  is  directed  towards  an  apparatus  for compensation  or  equalization  of  pressure  surges  in  the  course  of possible  dust,   dirt  or  gas  explosions  in  closed  systems,   such  as silos,   pipelines  or  the  like  with  a  hinged  cover  or  lid  in lightweight  construction  pivotable  around  a  pivot  axis  at  an outlet  stub.<br>
In  order  to  divert  pressure  surges  in  containers through  pipelines  prior  to  their  striking  for  instance  downstream elements  such  as  filters  or  the  like,   so-called  explosion protection  covers  or  lids  are  known,   as  for  instance  from  the  DE-A-24   55   325,    the  DE-A-30   42   026  or  the  DE-A  31   06   138.      This lastly  mentioned  explosion  protection  lid  in  lightweight construction  has  given  a  good  account  of  its  self   in  actual practice,   especially  the  system  for  damping  of  the  lid  when  it opens  as   intended.     A  refinement  of  the  damping  system  is  shown in  the  DE-A-36   26   946.<br>
It  was  seen  that  in  particular  in  pipelines  due  to  the extremely  high  propagation  velocity  of  pressure  surges  or  waves, which  can  normally  only  propagate  in  one  direction  in  pipelines, the  lastly  mentioned  arrangement  can  still  be  improved,   in particular  as  far  as  the  design  of  the  hinged  lid  itself  is concerned.<br>
It   is  a  task  of  the  invention  to  design  such  a  hinged cover  or  lid  in  an  even  more  lightweight  manner,   so  that  it  can<br><br>
be  moved  by  the  pressure  surge  in  particular  at  an  even  higher velocity  without  being  destroyed  in  the  open  position.<br>
This  task  is  solved  by  the  invention  in  an  arrangement of  the  previously  described  type  in  that  the  hinged  lid  is configured  at  least  partially  as  a  hollow  member.<br>
The  design  as  partial  hollow  member  entails  a  large number  of  advantages,     Thus  thinner  sheet  metal  plates  can overall  be  used  for  the  construction  of  the  lid,   the  cavity  can be  used  for  additional  purposes  as  this  is  described  further below  and  more  of  the  like.<br>
It   is  provided  in  the  design  that  the  hinged  lid  or cover  has  a  planar  outer  surface,   wherein  the  surface  of  the hinged  lid  pointing  towards  the  inside  of  the  stub  and  located opposite  the  inner-and  outer-surface  is  configured  in  an  arched or  domed  manner.<br>
This  design  provides  additional  considerable advantages,   as  tests  have  shown,   namely  that  the  impacting pressure  surge  does  not  hit  a  planar  surface,   rather  an  arched  or domed  one,   which  on  the  one  hand  results  in  an  improved initiation  of  the  opening  forces  and  on  the  other  hand  to  a 'better  diversion  of  the  gases  striking  in  an  explosion-like manner.<br>
Further  advantages  of  the  invention  result   from  the additional  dependent  claims.      Thus   the  cavity  of   the  hinged  lid or  cover  can  be   foamed  out  with  insulation  foam  material,   the  lid can  additionally  be  equipped  with  a  hinge  bracket  and/or  with  a heating  device  or  more  of  the  like.<br><br>
It can also be provided in the invention, to thermally separate the internal and external surface of the hinged cover, for instance to rivert or bond said surfaces against one another with interposition of a plastics insulation ring. This is expedient especially if formation of condensation water is to be avoided. It is also advantageous to equip the apparatus in the invention with damping elements for the opening hinged cover, as these were already described in the already mentioned systems in the DE-A-31 06 138 or the DE-A-36-26-946.<br>
According to the invention it is also provided that the recovery dish be equipped with a clamping spring lock for fixation of the swiveled out lid or cover in the open state, in order to prevent the lid from swiveling back in an uncontrolled manner. It is also achieved in case of an explosion, by the fixation or fastening in the open position that this disturbance can be optically determined from the outside due to the open and kept open lid.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides an apparatus for<br>
compensating explosion-induced pressure surges in a closed system having<br>
pressure relief means, said apparatus comprising; an outlet stub attachable to<br>
the pressure relief means; and a hollow lid pivotally attached to said outlet<br>
stub, wherein the lid has an external planar wall and an internal arched wall<br>
attached to the external planar wall and having a concave surface thereof<br>
facing the external planar wall, the external planar wall and the internal<br>
arched wall defining together a hollow of the lid.	<br><br>
*<br>
In the following the invention is described with particularity with the help of examples shown in the accompanying drawing, which show on:<br>
Figure 1       a side view of the arrangement partially in section.<br>
Figure 2      plan view along arrow II in figure 1, and<br>
Figure 3a to 3c a portion of the valve in the invention with a part of the receovery dish, wherein the lid is presented in three diflferent positions relatively to the recovery dish.<br>
The arrangement generally designated   with the numeral 1  in the  figures comprises   an  outlet   stub 2, which   can    for   instance—~<br><br>
be  flanged  to  a  load  relief  portion  of  the  pipe  line.     This outlet  stub  2   is  provided  with  a  hinged  lid  generally  designated by  the  numeral  3,   which  in  case  of  an  application  of  pressure, for  instance  by  a  blast  or  deflagration  in  the  pipeline  can  be pivoted  around  a  pivot  axis  4  against  a  flexural   recovery  or capturing  dish  5  of  which  only  a  portion  is  shown  in  figure  1.<br>
The  hinged  lid  3   is  configured  as  a  hollow  member, meaning  it  has  a  planar  external  surface  6,   for  instance  from aluminum  sheet  of  2  mm.   thickness,   and  an  internal  surface  7 curved  or  arched  in  spherical  segment  like  manner;   herein  the cavity  designated  by  the  numeral  8  between  the  internal   surface  7 and  the  external  surface   6  is  filled  with  a  plastics  foam  9.<br>
The  external  surface  6  and  internal   surface  7  can  also be  connected  with  one  another  by  point  welding  along  the  contact line  10  which  is  outlined  in  a  dotted  manner  in  figure  2;   in  this case  however,   an  interposed  insulation  ring  for  thermal separation  can  be  provided  in  such  a  way,   that  the  external surface  6  and  the  internal  surface  7  and  said  insulation  ring  are bonded  or  riveted  with  one  another,   which  has  not  been  shown  in detail  here.     The  metal  sheet  forming  the  internal  surface  7 comprises  a  sealing  web  11  embracing  the  outlet  stub  2 externally,   which  sealing  web  11  engages  from  the  top  into  an annular  seal  12  which  externally  surrounds  the  outlet  stub  2.<br>
The  lid  3   is  provided  in  the  area  of  the  pivot  axis  4 with  a  hinge  bracket  partially  overlapping  same  externally,   which hinge  bracket  13  can  also  be  configured  at  least  regionally  as  a pocket,   into  which  the  hinqed  lid  3   engages<br><br>
It  is  shown  additionally  in  figures   1  and  2  that  the recovery  or  capturing  dish  5  is  flexurally  supported  by  means  of helical  springs  14;   the  possibility  of  equipping  the  hinged  lid  3 with  an  additional  heating  device  is  not  shown  in  detail.<br>
The  hinged  lid  3   is  shown  in  different  positions relatively  to  the  flexural  capture  dish  5  in  figures  3a.   to  3c. Herein  it  can  be  seen  from  these  figures,   that  the  flexural capture  or  recovery  dish  5  is  equipped,   in  the  upper  region  of the  example  shown,   with  a  clamping  spring  lug  15,   which  lug cooperates  with  the  margin  or  edge  11  of  the  lid  3   in  such  a  way, that  the  edge  11  can  pivot  to  below  the  lug  15,   can  however  be fixed  in  the  open  position  by  means  of  a  nose-like  attachment  16.<br>
The  different  pivot  positions  are  shown  in  figure  3a. to  3c.,   wherein  in  figure  3a.   the  lid  3   is  still  comparatively far  from  the  capturing  dish  5,   with  the  pivoting  motion  in  the opening  direction  being  indicated  by  the  arrow  17.     In  figure  3b. the  lid  3   is  shown  just  before  contact  with  the  clamping  spring lug  15,   while  in  figure  3c.   the  detent  or  snap-in  position  is shown,   meaning  the   lid  3   is   fixed  in  the  open  position  in  the capture  or  recovery  dish  5  by  the  clamping  spring  lug  15  or  the clamping  extension  16.<br>
Naturally  the  embodiment  example  described  in  the invention  can  still  be  changed  in  many  respects,   without abandoning  the  thought   in  the  invention.     Thus  the  invention  is not  necessarily  limited  to  the  curvature  or  arching  of  the internal  surface  7  as  a  spherical  segment,   in  this  respect  a<br><br>
cross  sectional  elliptical  shape  or  a  shape  curved  in  another  way can  be  provided  and  more  of  the  same.<br><br><br><br>
