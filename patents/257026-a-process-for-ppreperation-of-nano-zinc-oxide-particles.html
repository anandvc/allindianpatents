COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is<br>
to be performed.<br><br>
The invention relates to a process for preparing nano particles. More particularly the invention relates to a process for the preparation of nano zinc oxide particles.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART<br>
Zinc Oxide is used for various purposes including as a white pigment, as a catalyst, as a constituent of anti-bacterial skin protection ointment, sunscreens and wood varnishes. Zinc oxide is also known as wide band gap semiconductor and is well suited for emissive devices. Materials used for blocking UV radiation are required to be transparent to the visible part of the solar radiation while blocking the harmful UV radiation and nano zinc oxide is considered favorable in this regard. The term 'nano' or 'nano particle' is generally used to refer to particles having a diameter of less than about 1 OOnm.<br>
Though numerous processes are known for the synthesis of nano zinc oxide particles, such processes are not scalable in an efficient manner and do not produce free flowing nano zinc oxide particle powders. This limitation is often a significant deterrent in the commercialization of nano zinc oxide particles.<br>
The essential process for the synthesis of nano zinc oxide is a basic alcoholic hydrolysis of zinc metal precursor and most known processes describe the synthesis of nano zinc oxide particles in an alcohol or an alcohol-water mixture as the medium of reaction. Such processes involve dissolving the metal precursor by heating or boiling the alcohol with reactions carried out at elevated temperatures. As these families of precursors have poor solubility in alcohols; the processes require heating them to high temperatures, typically the boiling points in the case of alcohols. Examples of such processes may be found in US 6710091; US2006/0222586; US2003/0172845; and in Koch et.al Chemical Physics Letters, 122- 507,1985.<br><br><br>
It would be useful to identify a process by which free flowing nano zinc oxide particles may be formed and that such a process be scalable to allow for large scale production of nano zinc oxide particles.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
The invention relates to a process for the preparation of nano zinc oxide particles comprising dissolving a zinc metal precursor in a solvent to obtain a first solution; dissolving a base in an alcohol to obtain an alkali solution; and adding the alkali solution to the first solution over a predetermined period of time to obtain nano zinc oxide particles in dispersion.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
For the purpose of promoting an understanding of the principles of the invention, reference will now be made to the embodiment described and specific language will be used to describe the same. It will nevertheless be understood that no limitation of the scope of the invention is thereby intended, such alterations and further modifications in the process, and such further applications of the principles of the invention therein being contemplated as would normally occur to one skilled in the art to which the invention relates.<br><br><br>
It will be understood by those skilled in the art that the foregoing general description and the following detailed description are exemplary and explanatory of the invention and are not intended to be restrictive thereof.<br>
A method to synthesize nano zinc oxide particles in a single-phase organic medium is disclosed. The process in accordance with the principles of the invention preferably involves dissolving the zinc metal precursor in a solvent followed by the addition of a basic-alcohol solution to obtain nano zinc oxide particles. More specifically, the process involves dissolving the zinc metal precursor in a solvent such as N,N dimethylformamide (DMF) to obtain a first solution, dissolving a base in an alcohol to obtain an alkali solution, and the addition of the alkali solution to the first solution to obtain nano zinc oxide particles.<br>
The following description refers to certain specific compounds such as alcohols, bases; solvents and non solvents to explain the principles of the invention. The invention however is not restricted to such compounds as any equivalent chemical compound may be utilized to achieve the desired end result as taught by the invention.<br>
In the following description zinc acetate dehydrate has been employed as the source of zinc while the solvent employed is N,N dimethylformamide (DMF). The zinc acetate dehydrate is dissolved in N,N dimethylformamide (DMF) to obtain a first clear solution. A second solution is prepared independently by dissolving sodium hydroxide in ethanol to get an alkali solution. The alkali solution is added to the zinc acetate solution in a controlled manner and over a predetermined period of time to ensure that only nano zinc oxide particles are formed.<br>
To precipitate or cause sedimentation of the nano zinc oxide particles a non-solvent such as acetone, hexane, heptane and toluene, or any similar members of their family, or<br><br><br>
any combination of them is preferably added to the reaction mixture. On the addition of the non-solvent the nano zinc oxide particles eventually settle down.<br>
It is preferred that the manner of addition of the alkali solution to the first solution is not a dumping operation, but spread over a period of time that is appropriate to dehydrate the zinc hydroxide formed after the addition of the alkali solution, such that nano zinc oxide particles in dispersion is obtained. Preferably such process may be executed by adding the alkali at a rate of approximately 1 % of alkali a minute continuously, or alternatively by adding predetermined amounts of the alkali at specific intervals spread apart by a predetermined period, such as a time interval of 5 to 10 minutes and adding 5% to 10% of the alkali at each interval. Accordingly the process of addition may be spread over 50 to 100 minutes depending on the percentage of reaction completion required to get appropriate particle size and yield.<br>
The base used for the preparation of the alkali solution may be any OH" or NH" group containing basic compound particularly an alkali metal one like NaOH, KOH, LiOH, tetramethylammonium hydroxide or any other member of the similar family, preferably sodium hydroxide.<br>
The alcohol may be a monoalcohol or polyalcohol particularly ethanol, methanol, propanol or any other member of the alcohol family, preferably ethanol The reactions involved in the process may be summarized as:<br>
Zn(CH3COO")2 + 2NaOHZn(OH)2  +  2CH3COONa	(1)<br>
Zn(OH)2    ZnO +H20	(2)<br><br><br>
As shown by equation 1, zinc acetate reacts with sodium hydroxide to provide zinc hydroxide and sodium acetate. The zinc hydroxide is dehydrated to provide nano zinc oxide and water.<br>
In accordance with an aspect of the invention, a process for the extraction of the nano zinc oxide particles at industrial scale is disclosed. The use of non solvent for precipitation of the nano particles provides for a simple way to extract particles at high throughput. The process involves sedimentation followed by decantation, centrifugation and finally drying of nano particles over phosphorus pentaoxide in a vacuum desiccator.<br>
The nano particles are obtained early on in the process as dispersion. Subsequent processing is done to this dispersion to obtain nano zinc oxide particles as dry powder. The dispersion so obtained containing nano zinc oxide particles is extremely stable under refrigeration. In accordance with an aspect, the dispersion may be used for applying ultra violet coatings on glass, metals and wood etc. The dispersion may be applied directly as a thin coating on glass. As the dispersion is transparent the films applied to glass are also transparent. Moreover, the dispersion in solvent such as DMF is very stable and the process of preparing the dispersion is economical and provides significant advantages in subsequent glass coating.<br>
In accordance with an aspect, the dispersion so prepared may be transferred to a glass manufacturing facility under refrigeration or maybe prepared at the glass manufacturing facility.<br>
The refrigeration temperatures may be kept preferably between 0 C to 4 C or even below.<br>
In accordance with an aspect, it is preferred that on completion of the addition of the alkali solution to the zinc acetate solution, the reaction mixture is stirred to ensure that the reaction is complete and that all the zinc acetate is converted to nano zinc oxide. The<br><br><br>
formation of nano zinc oxide particles may be monitored by doing intermediate UV visible spectroscopy.<br>
In accordance with an aspect, the solution containing nano zinc oxide particles is transferred to a separating means to allow the nano zinc oxide particles to settle; removing the settled nano zinc oxide particles from the separating means; decanting excess solution present in the nano zinc oxide particles removed from the separating means; and centrifuging the nano zinc oxide particles.<br>
The separating means may for example be a separating funnel. The centrifuged nano zinc oxide particles may be vaccume dried over phosphorus pentaoxide.<br>
In accordance with an embodiment, the process may be used to obtain capped nano zinc oxide particle powders. The cappant is preferably added to the metal precursor, such as the zinc acetate solution, prior to the addition of the alkali solution that allows for capping the nano zinc oxide particles as soon as they are formed. Any known organic and inorganic molecules including alkylamines like octylamine, dodecylamine, hexadecylamine; polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP), alkanethiols, carboxylic acids, phosphines, substituted phosphines, phosphine oxides and substituted phosphine oxides may be employed for capping the nano zinc oxide particles. The process allows for the introduction of a cappant without requiring any alteration or modification to the basic process for the production of nano zinc oxide particles.<br>
The exactly molar process allows for the continuous production of the nano zinc oxide particles and thus enables the large scale production of riano zinc oxide particles.<br>
The dissolving of the zinc metal precursor in DMF provides for significant advantages including no requirement of heating the reaction mixture, easily scalable process for high concentrations, the production of dry nano zinc oxide particles at high throughput and a narrow particle distribution.<br><br><br>
The high solubility of the zinc metal precursor in DMF at room temperature allows for high production rate of nano zinc oxide particles.<br>
The nano zinc oxide particles obtained are perfectly dry powder which is a significant advantage of the process. Moreover, the final product is an odorless, white free flowing nano zinc oxide particle powder. UV visible spectroscopy on the final product in the dry powder form indicated that all powders are transparent to visible radiation and block the UV radiation. A TEM on the powders indicated that the particle size varies between 5 nm to 50 nm depending upon the concentration and reaction completion done. The entire synthesis process is carried out at room temperature.<br>
The simplicity of the process, particularly the absence of any heating requirements and the perfectly molar reactions, involving stirring and decantation operations, allows the process to be easily scaled up to any volume.<br>
