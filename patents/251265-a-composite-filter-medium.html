The Composite Filler Medium<br>
The present invention provides a composite filter medium including a charged medium and a pH altering material that alters the pH of an influent such lhat microbiological contaminants present in the influent maintain a first charge that is opposite that of a charged medium having a second charge. For example, lhe pH altering material may raise the pH of the influent to less than about 10, preferably about 7 to about 9,   Within this pH range, i.e. higher that the isoeleciric point of certain microbiological organisms, such organisms assume a negative charge. Within this same pH range, the charge on the filter medium can be arranged to be strongly positive, the isoelectric point of the filter medium is greater than about 9, and preferably, greater than about 10, so that there is a substantial electric attraction between the target organisms and the surface of the filler medium.<br>
The majority of microbiological contaminants are negatively charged at a pH of about 6 to about 8 in most non-potable water sources.  When the microbiological contaminants maintain a negative charge they are readily intercepted using electro-kinetic methods with a positively charged filter medium.    However, positively charged microorganisms will have greatly reduced capture using a positively charged filter medium.  Polio virus has an isoelectric point at a pH of about 7 such lhat only at alkaline pH will the polio virus have a negative charge.   It is, therefore, advantageous to assure that any filter operates within a pH range where the target microorganisms are negatively charged and the filter medium sustains a positive charge, i.e., in a pH range between the isoelectric points of the microorganism and the filter medium.   The composite filter medium of the present invention will alter  the  pH   of  the   influent  pH  to  less  than  about   10  such  that microbiological   contaminants  in the influent are  sufficiently  negatively charged so that a positively charged filter medium may effectively capture those contaminants.  Depending upon the fluid to be filtered, a charged filter<br><br>
medium used in conjunction wilh a pH altering material To buffer the influent will provide more effective microbiological contaminant reduction. The Charged Medium<br>
The charged medium of the composite filter medium of the present invention may be any charged medium known to one skilled in the art. Such charged media may comprise membranes, solid composite fitter media such as extruded carbon blocks, nanofiber filter media, arid ihe tike. The charge on the charged medium may be obtained through chemical treatment of the materials used to make the medium or using materials that have a natural charge.<br>
In order to provide significant microbiological interception, the composite filter medium must have a sufficiently tight pore structure, or microporous structure, to provide short diffusion distances from the fluid to the surface of the filter medium. The charge provided by the charged medium aids in electro-kinetic interception of microbiological contaminants, while the tight pore structure provides a short diffusion path and, therefore, rapid diffusion kinetics of contaminants in a flowing fluid to the surface of the composite filter medium. The light pore structure also provides supplemental direct mechanical interception of microbiological contaminants. Due to the dominant role of diffusion for the interception of extremely small particles, i.e., particles significantly smaller than the pores of the filter medium, there is a direct correlation between the log reduction value of many small viral particles and the contact time of the influent within the filter medium, rather than a dependence upon the thickness of the filter medium.<br>
Preferred charged media are disclosed in copending patent applications U.S. Application Serial Nos. 10/286,695 directed to nanofiber or membrane filter media, and 10/290,803 directed to solid composite block filter media wherein both types of filter media have a microporous structure for enhanced microbiological interception. The microporous structures are treated with a microbiological  interception enhancing agent capable of<br><br>
creating a  positive charge on at least a  portion  of the  surface of the microporous structure.   A catir&gt;nic meial complex is formed on at least a portion of the surface of at least some of the fibers or the membrane by treating the fibers or membrane with a cationic chemical compound followed by precipitation of a metal with the anion associated with the calionic surface treatment.   In a solid composite block filter media, the active particles of the microporous   structure   are   chemically   treated   with   a   microbiological interception enhancing agent capable of creatine a positive charge on the surface of the active particles.  Likewise, the cationic metal complex can be formed on at least a portion of the surface of the active particles by treating the  active  particles  with  a  cationic  chemical   compound  followed  by precipitation of a metal with the anion associated with the cationic surface treatment.   The chemical treatment produces a strong positive charge upon the treated surfaces as measured using streaming potential analysis and this positive charge is retained at pH values below about 10-5. The pH Altering Material<br>
Preferably, the pH altering material comprises a slow dissolving alkaline material that raises the pH of an influent to less than about 10.5, preferably about 7 to about 9, such that microbiological contaminants present in the influent are all substantially negatively charged. Useful alkaline materials are inorganic carbonates such as magnesium carbonate, sodium bicarbonate and calcium carbonate, limestone, with calcium carbonate being most preferred. By altering the pH of the influent to a pH greater than the highest isoelectric point of human enteric virus, substantially all microbiological contaminants of interest maintain a negative charge such that a positively charged medium can more effectively intercept the microbiological contaminants.<br>
The pH altering material may be incorporated into the composite filter medium using known methods in the art. The pH altering material can be incorporated  directly  into  the  charged  medium.     Flat sheet structures<br><br>
incorporating the pH altering material can be made by imbedding the panicles of such pH altering material into a nonwoven fibrous layer or membrane, with or without a binder. The nonwoven fibrous layer or membrane can also be chemically Treated with a microbiological interception enhancing agent capable of creating a positive charge on the surface of the fibrous layer or membrane to form a charged medium. Particulate pH altering material may be admixed with a binder and fused to a substrate to form a flat sheet structure in accordance with United States Patent No. 5,792,513 to Koslow ('513 patent), herein incorporated by reference, to form a prefilter upstream from the charged medium. In practicing the process of the '513 patent, the nanoffber filter medium disclosed in co-pending U.5. Patent Application Serial No. 10/286,695 or other charged medium can be used as the substrate upon which the pH altering material and binder are fused.<br>
FIGS, 1A and 1B are cross-sectional views of composite filter media 10 of the present invention comprising an adsorbent prefilter layer 11 and a microbiological interception layer 19.  The composite filter medium 10 can be made of discrete layers as shown in FIG. 1A.   In FtG. 1A, the composite filter medium 10 has an adsorbent prefilter layer 11 over a charged medium 20 having microbiological interception capabilities.   The adsorbent prefilter layer 11 comprises an adsorbent supporting substrate 12.  At least a portion of substrate 12 is coated with pH altering material 14, adsorbent particles 16, and binder particles 18 which are fused to each other and to the surface of substrate 12.    The coating on the adsorbent supporting substrate 12 is obtained according to a method which is described in the '513 patent  As basically described in the '513 patent, the coating is obtained by preparing a mixture of particles of pH altering material adsorbent panicles, and binder particles.   Preferably, the binder particles have an average particle size not exceeding approximately 80 microns. The mixture ts applied to part or all of the adsorbent supporting substrate 12 to produce a loose powder coating on<br><br>
the front surface. The loose powder coating is heated to at least me SUUCM»..&amp; temperature of the binder particles but below the melting temperature of the adsorbent .supporting substrate 12 and the particles of pH altering material and adsorbenl \o form softened binder panicles 13&gt; Pressure h applied to the web substrate 12 to cause the softened binder particles 18 to fuse with the pH altering material 14, adsorbent particles 16 and to the adsorbent supporting substrate 12. After or during heating the powder coating to at least the softening temperature of binder particles 1&amp;, a second substrate 15 may be laid over the powder coating and adhered to the powder mixture prior to cooling of the softened binder particles. The microbiological interception layer 19 as shown in FIG- 1A comprises charged medium 20 comprising a plurality of nanofibers 22.<br>
In FIG. IB, the composite filter medium 10 having an adsorbent prefilter layer 11 and a microbiological interception layer 19 can be made by using charged medium 20 as the supporting substrate upon which at least a portion of a surface of charged medium 20 is coated with pH altering material 14, adsorbent particles 16, and binder 18 which are fused to each other and to the surface of charged medium 20. An overlying substrate, not shown, may be placed over the powder coating during manufacturing in the manner discussed above in FIG. 1 A,<br>
The pH altering material, alone or in combination with other adsorbents, may be incorporated as a flat sheet structure in the composite filter medium where it is positioned upstream from the charged medium in axial flow devices. In radial flow devices, the flat sheet siaicture can be wrapped around or rolled into the corcof a solid filter medium, for example, an extruded carbon block, such that the influent contacts the pH altering material prior to contact with the carbon block filter medium. Alternatively, in solid extruded filter media, the pH altering material may be incorporated directly into the mixture of adsorbents and/or absorbents, additives, and binder to  be  extruded,  for  example,  into  solid  composite  blocks  in<br><br>
accordance with United States Patent No. 5,019,37 7 To Kosfow which is herein incorporated by reference.<br>
Preferably, the pH altering material is incorporated into an adsorbent prefilter medium that also contains an adsorbent that removes charge-reducing natural organic matter. Natural organic matter, such a.? polyanionic humic and fulvic acids, reduce ihe charge on a positively charged medium by coating and complexing with the positively charged structure, (hereby decreasing the effectiveness of the filter to remove negatively charged microbiological contaminants. By raising the pH of the influent to greater than pH 7, polyanionic acids such as humic acid are more effectively removed by an adsorbent such as activated carbon.<br>
The pH altering material should be present in an amount and form sufficient to alter the influent pH to a desired target. When incorporated into a prefilter to raise the influent pH to less than about 10, preferably about 7 to about 9, an inorganic carbonate can be used in about 10 to about 50 weight percent of the prefilter medium, preferably about 30 weight percent, The average particle size of the inorganic carbonate is preferably sufficiently large so that it does not readily dissolve when exposed to large volumes of water during the service life of the composite filter medium but sufficiently small to allow relatively short contact time. The pH altering material is preferably has an average particle size of about -50 to about -150 mesh, more preferably<br>
about -100 mesh,   A preferred inorganic carbonate is dolomitic limestone<br>
having an average particle size of about -100 mesh.<br>
In  municipal water treatment systems or other  in-line treatment<br>
processes, the pH of the influent may be altered with an infusion or direct<br>
injection or addition of the pH altering material prior to contact with the<br>
charged medium.    Preferably, the pH altering material is added as an<br>
aqueous solution or dispersion.<br>
In some cases, the pH adjustment can be accomplished using a<br>
suitable buffer or ion-exchange resin that sustains a target pH in the effluent<br><br>
In   the   case   of   ion-exchange   materials,   these   might   be   periodically regenerated using alkaline solutions.<br>
Filler Systems Incorporating The pH Altering iVtaf&amp;rial<br>
A filler system of ihe present invention, either a pressurized or gravity-flow system, can include a composite filter medium comprising a charged medium having a microporous structure having a mean flow path of less than about 2 microns and treated with a microbiological Interceplion agenl that provides a highly positive charge on at least a portion of the surface of the microporous structure, an adsorbent prefilter for removing charge-reducing contaminants, and a pH altering material for increasing the influent pH 10 less than about 10, preferably about 7 lo about 9.   Preferably, the microporous structure comprises a plurality of nanofibers, a membrane, or a solid carbon block.      Where  the   microporous  structure   comprises   nanofibers   or  a membrane, ii is preferable to incorporate the pH altering material inio ihe adsorbent prefilter using the process disclosed in United States Patent No. 5,792,513 to Ko5low.   The pH altering material is preferably an inorganic carbonate present in an amount of about 30 weight percent of the adsorbent prefilter composition having an average particle size of about -50 to about -150, preferably about -100 mesh.    The adsorbent prefilter is positioned upstream from the charged medium to remove charge-reducing contaminants and to increase the pH of the influent prior to the influent contacting the charged medium.   Preferably, a particulate prefilter is included in the filter system and also positioned upstream from the adsorbent prefilter. Such filter systems   of the   present  invention   have   been  shown   to  enhance  the interception of microbiological contaminants as illustrated in the examples below.<br><br>
Examples<br>
The following example? are provided to illustrate the present invention and should not be construed as limiting the scope of the indention.<br>
Poromctry studies were performed wUh an Automated Capillary Flow Pornmeter available from Porous Materials, Inc., Ithaca, New York. Parameters determined, using standard procedures published by the equipment manufacturer, include mean How pore size and gas (air) permeability. The flow of air was assayed at variable pressure on both the dry and wet filter medium. Prior to wet runs, the filter medium was initially immersed in silicon oil for at least 10 minutes while held under high vacuum.<br>
Zeta or streaming potential of various filter media was determined using streaming potential and streaming current measured with a BI-EKA Electro-Kinetic Analyzer available from Brookhaven Instruments, of Holtsville, New York. This instrument includes an analyzer, a flat-sheet measuring cell, electrodes, and a data control system. The analyzer includes a pump to produce the pressure required to pass an electrolyte solution, generally 0.0015M potassium chloride, from a reservoir, through the measuring cell containing a sample of the filter medium described herein. 5ensors for measuring temperature, pressure drop, conductivity and pH are disposed externally of the cell. In accordance with this melhod the electrolyte solution is pumped through the porous material. As the electrolyte solution passes through the sample, a displacement of charge occurs. The resulting "streaming potential and/or streaming current1' can be detected by means of the electrodes, placed at each end of the sample. The zeta (streaming) potential of the sample is then determined by a calculation according to the method of Fairbrother and Mastin that takes into account the conductivity of the electrolyte.<br>
Bacterial   challenges  of  the   filter   media   were   performed   using suspensions of Escherichia coli of the American Type Culture Collection<br><br>
(ATCC) NO. 11775, and Klebsiella torrigena ATCC No. 33527, to evaluate the response to a bacterial challenge. The response to viral challenges was evaluated using MS-2 bacteriophage ATTC No. 15597-B1, and FRD-1 ATCC No. 19585-B1. The Standard Operating Procedures of the ATCC were used for propagation of ihe bacterium and bacteriophage, and standard microbiological procedures, as well known in 1he art, were used for preparing and quantifying the microorganisms in both the influent and effluent of filters challenged with suspensions of the microbiological particles. The challenges were prepared with RO/DI water unless otherwise specified.<br>
Sheets of a charged media having a microporous structure were used in the following examples and prepared as follows. To a blender was added 0.90    g   SHORT   STUFF®   EST-8   binder   fibers   with    1.0    I    reverse osmosis/deionized {RO/DO water and the binder was blended for about 30 seconds on a pulse setting.  To the binder dispersion was added 27.4 g dry weight lyocell fibers as a 10%  by weight wet pulp having a Canadian Standard Freeness of about 45, unless otherwise indicated- The mixture was blended for another 15 seconds with an additional 800 ml of RO/DI water until the fibers were fully dispersed.  To the fiber mixture was added 6-0 ml of MERQUAT® 100' as a 30% aqueous solution.   The fibers were blended with the MERQUAT® 100 for about 10 seconds and left to stand for at least about 4 to 6 hours.   After about 4 to 6 hours, the fibers were poured into a standard 8 inch Brit jar fitted with a 100 mesh forming wire and excess water removed under vacuum to form a resulting pulp sheet. A dilute silver nitrate solution, 15 ml of a 3% stock solution (1.8g in 60 ml RO/Ol water), to provide 0.45 g silver, was poured uniformly over the pulp sheet for full exposure and saturation. The silver nitrate solution was left on the pulp sheet for at least about 15 minutes and excess water removed under vacuum pressure.  The silver-treated pulp sheet was then torn into small pieces and placed in a WARING® blender and re-dispersed in 2-0 L of deionteed water.<br><br>
A second portion of the MERQUAT® 100 solution, 6.0 ml, was added to the dispersion and the mixture blended for about 2 minutes.   The treated fibers were poured into a 30.5 x 30.5 cm2 stainless steel FORMAX® paper deckle fitted with a 100 mesh forming screen and lined with a layer of REEMAY1" 2004, a nonwoven.   The deckle was previously filled with about 24.0 L of RO/DI water.  A 30 x 30 cm7 stainless steel agitator plate having 60 holes of 2 cm in diameter was used to plunge the fiber mixture up and down from top to bottom about 3 to 10 times.    The water was removed from the fiber mixture by pulling a slight vacuum below the deckle lo cause the fibers to form   on   the   nonwoven.     Once  the  bulk   of  the  water  is   removed, supplemental dewatering is accomplished with a vacuum pump to remove additional excess moisture and to create a relatively smooth, flat, fairly thin paper-like sheet-    The resulting sheet is separated from the screen and combined with a blotter sheet on both top and bottom. The combination of sheets is gently rolled with a 2.27 kg marble rolling pin to remove excess water and smooth out (he top surface of the sheet.  The sheet is then placed between two fresh and dry blotter sheets and placed on a FORMAX® sheet dryer for about 10 lo about 15 minutes at about 120°C.    The resultant charged medium is separated from the blotter sheets and directly heated on the FORMAX® sheet dryer for about 5 minutes on each side to activate the dry binder fibers.   A streaming or zeta potential of the charged medium showed a zeta potential of greater than about +20 mV. The mean flow path of the charged medium was about 0.35 microns.<br>
The adsorbent prefilters, also referred to as PLEKX® layers, were made in accordance with United States Patent No. 5,792,513 to Koslow, the "PLEKX®* process. Both the top and bottom substrates were a nonwoven, hydroentangled, spunlace, unless otherwise specified, available from E.I. cluPont deNemours Company, Wilmington, Delaware, as DuPont® 18620 trimmed to a width of about 25 cm. The powder mixture was Grade OL Carbon from Calgon Carbon Corporation, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, treated<br><br>
with 1 wt.% MERQUAT® TOO and 0.5 wt.% sifver, ground to an average particle size of about &amp;0 x 325 mesh with 22% PAN; ^A wt.% MICRO"! HENE*5' FN-510 polyethylene binder, available from Equistar Chemicals, LP., Tuscola, Illinois, and 9 wi.% SOLKA-FLOC* 1016 purified cellulose, available Uom International Fiber Corporation, North Tonawanda, New York. The web speed was about 0.8 m/min. The heated roller was 10 inches in diameter and heated by hot oil to a temperature of about 232nC (450°F). Pressure in the nip was about 72 kg/cm. Powder lay-down, and specific amounts of the carbon and pH altering material are specified in the examples.<br>
Examples 1 and 2: Comparative pH Studies With Carbon PLEKX® Layers As An Adsorbent PrefiHer Medium<br>
Effluent pH studies were conducted to determine whether there was any change in ihe effluent pH after contact with a carbon PLEKX® layer. Results are shown in Table I below. The lay-down was about 900 g/m2.<br><br>
PLEKX® layer was able to raise the pH of the effluent, but could not sustain the higher pH levels. After 1,5 I water flowed through the PLEKX® layer, the pH fell below 7. At an influent pH of 6-5 in Example 2, the buffering effect of the carbon-loaded PLEKX® prefiher appears to be insignificant.<br><br>
Examples S to 5: pH Studies With Carbon And Limestone PLEKX® Layers As An Adsorbent Prefiltsr f tedium<br>
Varying amounts of limestone obtained from Allyndale Corporation CAIIyndale limestone") were incorporated inio ihe carbon PIEKX® layer by reducing the amoirnt of carbon. The Allyndale limestone is an agricultural grade limestone having an average panicle size of about -100 mesh. The pH altering effect of the Allyndale limestone addition is shown in Table II below. The total lay-down was about 900 g/nv.<br><br>
raised and sustained the effluent pH to greater than 9 when the influent was about neulral pH. Reducing the amount of limestone to 35 wi.% and exposure to slightly more acidic water that more closely resembles natural water, provided excellent buffering capacity as well.<br>
Examples 6 and 7: pH Studies With Carbon And Limestone PLEKX® Layers In A Composite Filter Medium Of The Present Invention<br>
Two (2) carbon/limestone PLEKX® layers having a lay-down of 900 g/m2, were filled into a filter housing with one (1) layer of the charged medium and secured into place with a hot melt adhesive. A 20.0 L carboy filled with de-chlorinated tap water was attached to the inlet of the filter housing. The pH of the effluent exiting the filters was recorded and data shown in Table III below.<br><br>
In Example 6, pH modification is limited after exposure to Targe volumes of water. However, when the flow rate is increased in Example 7, the elevated pH levels are better sustained, on average about 7.5. After exposure to 90,0 L of low pH water, the filter of Example 7 was challenged with MS2 (2.06 x 10* prepared in RO/Dl water) to determine whether acceptable log reduction was possible. The filter was able to provide a Jog reduction of greater Than 9-0 for M52, after exposure to 90.0 L of low pH water.<br><br>
Example   8:   A   Composite   Filler   Medium   Of   The   Present   Invention Challenged With MS2<br>
A filter housing was assembled using si single layer of the charged medium followed by Iwo (2) layers of a PIEKX^ layer made with Grade OL Carbon from Calgcn Carbon Corporation, and about 35 wt.% pulverized Allynriale limestone, in accordance lo the process disclosed in United States Patent No. 5,792,513.    The charged medium used in rhi$ example was treated wirh sodium bromide with the first treatment of MERQUAT® 100. Each PLEKX® layer consisted of a lay down of about 600 to about 900 g/rn2 of particulate matter. A layer of INTERNET™ netting is placed on the bottom of the filter housing and secured in place with a hot melt adhesive.    The charged medium was attached securely to the netting followed by the two layers of PLEKX® material.  The entire filter housing was glued together with lhe hot melt adhesive to prevent any bypass. The actual filter area was about 2.5 in x 3.75 in (6.35 cm x 9.53 cm).  A 1/4 inch inner diameter hose was secured to the inlet of the filter housing using a hot melt adhesive and the outlet of the filter housing was open to fluid flow,   A pressure of about 4 inches (10.2 cm) water column was maintained at all times.   The filter was attached to carboys filled with RO/DI water.<br>
The filter was removed from the carboys and challenged with 250 ml of an MS2 solution at different intervals after a quantity of RO/DI water passed through the filter. The effluent was collected in sterile 250 ml Erlenmeyer flasks, diluted and plated on petri dishes following standard procedures and left overnight. After each challenge, the filter was re-attached to the carboys.<br><br><br>
after four challenges and exposure to targe volumes of water.<br>
Example   9:   A   Composite   Filter   Medium   Of  The   Present   Invention Challenged With £ co//<br>
A filter housing as described in Example 8 was challenged with E, coll Similarly excellent results were obtained with continuing bacterial challenges as shown in Table V below.<br><br>
bacterial log reduction values of greater than about 4 log until the flow is reduced to an unacceptable rate.<br>
Examples   10:  A  Composite  Filter Medium  Of The  Present   Invention Challenged With Klebsiella ferr/gena, PRD-1, and M52<br>
Three (3) filters were challenged with the above referenced three organism cocktail.   Filters made with carbon-only PLEKX® layers that did not<br><br>
include limestone are shown for comparison.    Each carbon-only PLEKX® layer had a lay-down of 600 g/m2, two layers were used.    Grade TOG carbon, from Calgon Corporation, was used in Comparative Filter A and Grade OL carbon was used in Comparative Filter B.   The composite filter medium of the present invention had a single carbon limestone PLEKX® layer having a lay-down of 1500 g/rn?.   One (1) layer of the charged medium, made using the general process described above, was glued securely into a ceramic buchner funnel 6 inches in diameter and 3 inches high on lop of a layer of INTERNET™ netting.   The PLEKX® layers were glued securely into place on lop of ihe charged medium.  Outside edges of the buchner funnel were glued to prevent bypass through the system.  Carboys of de-chlorinated tap water were placed above lhe buchner funnels and water passed through each funnel.   The fillers were pre-wetled with 500 ml de-chlorinated tap water and then challenged with 250 ml of the three organism cocktail prepared with de-chlorinated water.   Effluents were collected in sterile 250 ml Erlenmeyer flasks, diluted and plated on petri dishes following standard procedures and left overnight.   After each challenge, de-chlorinated water was passed Through each filler.<br><br><br><br><br>
greater test volumes than Fillers A and B lhat did not contain the pH altering material, limestone.<br>
Example 11: Long Term Study Of A Composite Filter Medium Of The Present Invention Challenged With Klebsiella terrigena, PRD-1, and MS2<br>
A filter similar to the filters used in Example 10 were assembled with one (1) layer of the charged medium, made according to the general description described above, and one (1) layer of Grade OL carbon PLEKX® having 35 wt% limestone placed upstream from the charged medium. The filters were initially wetted with RO/DI water and challenged with the three organism cocktail. Additional quantities of RO/DI water were passed through the filters prior to subsequent challenges.<br><br>
— 	1	1	I<br>
The filter of Example 11 maintained acceptable reduction of microbiological contaminants although the amount of water flowing through the filter even when the amount of water flowing through the filter had decreased to an unacceptable flow.<br><br>
Example 12:  Long Term Study Of A Composite Filler Medium Of The Present Invention Challenged With Klebsiella lerrigena, PRD-1r and M52<br>
The filter of Example 12 is similar lo ihe filters used in Example 10. The nanofibers usee! in ihe charged medium were treated with sodium bromide during treatment with the first portion of MERQUAT® 100 as described in the general described above and the remaining procedure followed accordingly. The fillers were initially wetted with RO/DI water and challenged with the three organism cocktail. Additional quantities of RO/DI water were passed through the filters prior to subsequent challenges.<br><br><br>
In Example 12, although the log reduction of the three organisms are exactly the same as in Example 11, Ihe volume of water that flowed through the filter is significantly greater due to The treatment with sodium bromide. The filters of both Examples 11 and 12 were able to maintain acceptable antibacterial and anti-viral performance.<br><br>
The composite filter medium of Ihe present invention provides enhanced microbiological interception during an extended period of time even when challenged wiih multiple organisms.<br>
While the present invention has been particularly described, in conjunction with a specific preferred embodiment, it IF evident that many alternatives, modifications and variations will be apparent to those skilled in the art in light of the foregoing description. It is therefore contemplated that the appended claims will embrace any such alternatives, modifications and variations as falling within the true scope and spirit of the present invention.<br><br><br><br>
