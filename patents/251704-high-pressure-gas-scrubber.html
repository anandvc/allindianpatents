[BYKOMBI]<br>
OF REMFRY 85 SAGAR ATTORNEY FOR THE APPLICANTS<br><br><br><br>
High-pressure gas scrubber for desulphurising coke oven<br>
gas<br>
The invention relates to a high-pressure gas scrubber for the separation of hydrogen sulphide from a gas containing hydrogen sulphide, e.g. coke oven gas, which consists essentially consist of a cylindrical container having at least one reaction section, where sodium hydroxide solution as the scrubbing agent is laterally introduced and sprayed from above into each reaction section in varying concentrations, in a countercurrent to the gas containing hydrogen sulphide which is supplied from below via chimney draw-off trays, and the cleaned gas is discharged via a take-off chamber in the upper part of the container and the enriched scrubbing agent is removed via the chimney draw-off trays, and that [sic] easily wetted expanded metal internals are provided below the lowest chimney draw-off tray and between the spray elements and a chimney draw-off tray.<br>
The high-pressure gas scrubber of the generic type is described in more detail in EP 0 956 140 Bl. Such a H2S scrubber or separator having one or more reaction sections arranged one above the other has a considerable number of disadvantages as regards the design and efficiency, i.e. the quality and cost-effectiveness of the gas cleaning.<br>
For instance, owing to the design of the chimneys in the chimney draw-off trays, different gas velocities are produced within the tray passages and also high pressure drops, in addition to gas turbulence and wall effects. Moreover, such a design in its entirety hinders the contact and retention time of the scrubbing medium with<br><br><br>
the gas, to the detriment of a suitable efficiency. The<br>
chimney draw-off trays do net have sufficient stability towards great pressure fluctuations andr when repair work is necessary as a result of soiling and deposits, require long downtimes due to the design. The enriched scrubbing medium is immediately removed in the vicinity of the tray and thus produces unnecessary soiling and deposits, in particular on the chimney draw-off trays.<br>
Starting from the described disadvantages of the prior art, the object on, which the invention is based is to provide a high-pressure gas scrubber or separator of hydrogen sulphide from coke oven gas for example, which is able to improve the amount of gas and its distribution in the reaction section prior to and after passing through the trays, reduce the pressure drops, the turbulence and wall effect, and improve the contact and retention time of the scrubbing medium with the gas with a view to better scrubbing, while ensuring general ease of repair and also a buffer of scrubbing liquid.<br>
The object is achieved according to the invention in that the chimney draw-off tray is detachably fixed to a flat steel ring welded to the container wall and is provided with a downslope, and in that the chimneys, which ensure a lower pressure drop as a result of an increased cross-section, are of a height extending beyond a safety outlet arranged above the chimney draw-off tray.<br>
The advantage of such a configuration of a high-pressure gas scrubber lies firstly in that the chimney draw-off tray enables a considerable increase in the free gas cross-section in relation to the available inside diameter of the scrubber and in terms of statics, with<br><br>
the result that the requirements and the gas distribution are improved. The scrubbing liquid can drain off in a specific manner if necessary, owing to the downslope of the chimney draw-off tray, so as to avoid the situation where scrubbing liquid remains on the tray when the scrubber is shut down. The required and necessary stabilisation of the tray is effected by angles which are welded onto the container wall so as to run transversely in the scrubber in the direction of the downslope, and on which the segments or segmental plates forming the tray are detachably fixed by screwing.<br>
The angle plates are not only a supporting structure for the segmental plates, but avoid the deformation or lifting of. the tray owing to the gas pressure. The gas flews without great pressure drops through the enlarged chimneys and is led in a specific manner into the reaction section via the different cover plates on the chimneys. The shape and arrangement of the cover plates enable uniform, homogeneous inflow and distribution of the amount of gas in the free cross-section of the scrubber. The gas velocity and gas distribution on leaving the chimneys can be chosen, through the slopes and adjustable angles of the cover plates, such that, on leaving, the greatest possible cross-section of the scrubber is immediately utilisable, and also that of the expanded metal packs arranged above the tray, for a minimal pressure drop in the chimneys. The cover plates of a particular shape, formed as roof-like slopes, in the vicinity of the container wall avoid the wall effect of the gas, which is unfavourable to the scrubbing process.<br>
In a countercurrent, the washing medium which is sodium hydroxide solution is distributed into the scrubber via<br><br>
injection nozzles. After passing through the expanded metal packs, the enriched liquid reaches the tray segments in part via channel-forming cover plates and in part directly, without adversely affecting the gas flow and distribution. The enriched liquid is collected in the laterally closed drainage pocket made of metal plates and until it reaches a defined filling level on the chimney draw-off tray provided with a downslope, the drainage pocket serving at the same time as a pump receiver. The liquid is supplied via an outlet connection to the suction line of a pump and thus back ro the scrubbing process. If a defined filling level is exceeded, the liquid is discharged into the sump of the scrubber via the safety outlet arranged above the tray. This arrangement constitutes a safety concept in order, in the event of malfunctions or failure or on switch-over of the pumps, to prevent the scrubbing liquid from rising on the tray as far as the outlet of the chimneys and thus coming directly into the path of the gas.<br>
The chimney draw-off tray, in conjunction with the described associated devices, is designed with such ease of maintenance that it can be demounted either completely or else individual segments can be demounted, in a simple way, without welded seam connections having to be severed,<br>
An exemplary embodiment of the invention is illustrated in the drawings and explained in more detail below. In the drawings:<br>
Figure 1 shows a partial section through a reaction<br>
section of a high-pressure gas scrubber, and<br><br>
Figure 2  shows a partial side view, in section, of the<br>
high-pressure gas scrubber illustrated in Figure 1.<br>
The exemplary embodiment depicted in partial sections and in different views in Figures 1 and 2 features as essential components of a high-pressure gas scrubber a chimney draw-off tray 3 and a reaction section 2. Such a high-pressure gas scrubber may comprise one or more reaction sections 2 arranged one above the other. Whatever the design, the high-pressure gas scrubber comprises a cylindrical container 1 which, as stated, may include one or more reaction sections 2. Inside the container 1, over the circumference thereof, a flat steel ring 5 is welded on, and a chimney draw-off tray 3 comprising segmental plates 10 is detachably fixed to the ring by means of screws. As can be gathered from Figure 2, the chimney draw-off tray 3 has in the direction of the arrow 16 a downslope in order to be able to drain off the scrubbing liquid in a specific manner. To stabilise the chimney draw-off tray 3, angle plates 11 are provided, which run transversely through the container 1 in the direction of the downslope and are welded to the container wall 4, and on which the segmental plates 10 forming a chimney draw-off tray 3 are arranged likewise in a detachably screwed manner,<br>
The gas to be cleaned enters the reaction section 2 from below. The gas pressure is from 6 to 8 bar. After passing through several layers (not illustrated) of expanded metal, the gas flows through the defined tray passages into the chimneys 6, which are made of metal plates and are of rectangular design. Cover plates 7, 8 of different shapes are provided, fixed on supports 9, at the chimney<br><br><br><br>
outlet. Such cover plates 7, 8 lead the gas stream into the further reaction section 2 in a specific manner. The cover plates 1 are of channel-shaped form and have an upwardly open angle which is to be chosen such that, as the gas leaves the chimneys 6, the greatest possible cross-section can be obtained in the reaction section 2 for a minimal pressure drop. In the edge region of the container 1, the chimneys 6 arranged there have cover plates 8 directed in the manner of a roof obliquely towards the centre of the container 1, so as to avoid the wall effect of the gas which is unfavourable to the scrubbing process.<br>
In a countercurrent, the scrubbing medium is distributed from above via injection nozzles and expanded metal packs (not illustrated). The enriched liquid reaches the secmental plates 10 in part via the cover plates 7, 8 and in part directly, without adversely affecting the gas flow and distribution. The enriched liquid is collected in the laterally adjoining drainage pocket 12 until it reaches a defined filling level 15, as shown in Figure 2. The drainage pocket 12 serves at the same time as a pump receiver, the liquid being supplied via an outlet connection 13 to a suction line (not illustrated) of a pump and thus back to the scrubbing process. If a defined filling level 15 is exceeded, the liquid is discharged into the sump of the scrubber via the safety outlet 14 arranged above the chimney draw-off tray 3.<br><br>
