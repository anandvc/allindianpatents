				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a variety of thermo-mechanically treatable low alloy steel<br>
having a microstructure adapted to provide combination of higher strength, ductility and<br>
corrosion resistance. The desired properties of strength, ductility, weldability and impact<br>
toughness of said low alloy steel is based on a selective steel composition followed by<br>
suitable rolling parameters adapted to provide the mixed microstructure providing for<br>
desired maximum strength-ductility combination. The invention would favor achieving<br>
simply and cost-effectively steel amenable to thermo mechanical treatment even without<br>
micro alloying due to synergistic effect of Mn rich multi-alloying. The microstructure is<br>
further directed to exhibit the pearlite lamellae and non-polygonal ferrite with high<br>
dislocation density, which is characterized as the acicular ferrite. The low alloy thermo-<br>
mechanically treatable Mn rich steel with the above microstructure is directed to achieve<br>
far superior strength with required ductility of the steel and thus providing wide industrial<br>
application in railways carriages/coaches and the like where processing of parts involves<br>
moderate forming and welding which are the basic processes in the application of steel<br>
work fabrication.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
It is well known in the application of rolled sections for steel structural fabrication that are<br>
exposed to open weather, the resistance to atmospheric corrosion is an essential property<br>
to be obtained in said steel along with strength, toughness, weldability and ductility.<br>
Conventionally, some of such properties are being maintained in the existing multi alloyed<br>
high strength low alloy steel (SAILCOR) with ferrite-pearlite microstructure which is in use<br>
for similar application. This particular grade of steel is consumed mainly by the Indian<br>
2<br><br>
Railways and other subsidiary organizations for manufacturing the superstructure and<br>
underframes/carriages of wagons and coaches or similar other equipments, generally<br>
exposed to open weather. General composition and strength properties of this existing<br>
SAILCOR grade is as given below:<br>
Chemical composition (wt% of elements): ----<br>
C	Mn	S	P	Si	Cr	Ni	Cu	Al<br>
0.08- 0.25- 0.04- 0.075- 0.28- 0.35- 0.28- 0.30-<br>
0.10 0.45 (max) 0.115 0.72 0.49 0.49 0.45<br>
YS: 345 MPa (Min)<br>
UTS: 480 MPa (Min)<br>
% elongation: 21(Min)<br>
In addition to atmospheric corrosion resistance, high strength, impact toughness<br>
and ductility are properties also required essentially for this steel because this grade of<br>
steel involves moderate to high degree of forming during production of components/parts<br>
in application. Although the existing grades of steel could provide the desired corrosion<br>
resistance and moderate strength properties, the same could not meet the requirement of<br>
other criteria of strength, toughness, ductility and weldability as necessary in application of<br>
steel structural.<br>
There had been therefore a persistent need to develop a grade of steel, for catering<br>
to the steel work fabrication and construction industries, that is capable of providing on<br>
one hand the desired improved strength, impact toughness, ductility and weldability in<br>
said steel which would be substantially formable and weldable without developing any<br>
defects during processing and at the same time exhibit favorable atmospheric corrosion<br>
resistance.<br>
3<br><br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is thus the basic object of the present invention to develop a grade of steel having<br>
selective chemistry and with controlled rolling parameters providing the desired properties<br>
of corrosion resistance as well as improved strength, ductility, toughness and weldability.<br>
A further object of the present invention is directed to a process for developing the steel<br>
having the abovesaid properties by selective modification of existing multi alloyed low<br>
steel with suitable rolling parameters to achieve mixed microstructure comprising fine<br>
grained ferrite, pearlite and acicular ferrite in said steel and thus realizing much superior<br>
strength with required ductility of steel.<br>
A still further object of the present invention is directed to a process for developing an<br>
improved quality low alloy steel through change in chemistry and development of a mixed<br>
microstructure consisting of ferrite, pearlite and acicular ferrite after thermomechanical<br>
treatment.<br>
A further object of the present invention is directed to developing a grade of high<br>
manganese steel with improved impact toughness and weldability having said preferred<br>
mixed microstructure.<br>
A still further object of the present invention is directed to additional amount of Mn<br>
alloying in SAILCOR steel with suitable rolling parameters for producing the mixed<br>
microstructure comprising ferrite, pearlite and acicular ferrite in the present steel such that<br>
newly developed thermomechanically treatable steel with the above microstructure has far<br>
superior strength with required ductility of the steel and the same is extendable to actual<br>
shop production scale.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION WITH REFERENCE TO THE ACCOMPANYING FIGURES<br>
The present invention is directed to developing an improved grade of steel as compared to<br>
multi alloyed high strength low alloy steel (SAILCOR) with ferrite-pearlite microstructure,<br>
presently being in regular use. For manufacturing Railways wagons and coaches and other<br>
industrial structural items exposed to open weather, a steel having high atmospheric<br>
corrosion resistance coupled with higher strength and ductility as well as toughness and<br>
weldability is required. Such properties are essentially required to be present in the steel<br>
because this steel involves moderate to high degree of forming/joining during its<br>
application. Impact toughness and weldability are equally important during applications of<br>
this steel. A mixed microstructure comprising ferrite, pearlite and acicular ferrite is suitable<br>
for ensuring the above properties in steel.<br>
The present invention is directed to achieve said improved properties by providing an<br>
additional amount of Mn alloying in SAILCOR steel maintaining suitable subsequent rolling<br>
parameters to make it capable of producing the mixed microstructure comprising ferrite,<br>
pearlite and acicular ferrite in the present steel. The newly developed thermomechanically<br>
treatable steel with the above microstructure has far superior strength with required<br>
ductility of the steel. The process of obtaining the Mn rich low alloy steel of the present<br>
invention having high strength and ductility is further described through the following<br>
Example.<br>
EXAMPLE<br>
Laboratory experimentations were carried out to study the influence of higher Mn en the<br>
microstructure and mechanical properties of the commercially available multi alloyed<br>
SAILCOR steel. In order to ascertain desired properties in resulting steel different<br>
8<br><br>
microstructures were developed after austenitization at 1000 °C and rolling at 900-740 °C.<br>
It has been found experimentally, that the preferred mixed microstructure of fine ferrite,<br>
pearlite and acicular ferrite resulted in the maximum strength-ductility combination. Such<br>
microstructure was achieved after austenitization at 1000°C and rolling at lower<br>
temperature (800°C) in non-recrystallization region. The experimentation was carried out<br>
through following steps:<br>
1.	Firstly, the steel is made in a 100 kg. air induction furnace.<br>
2.	The steel metal was cast into ingots that are soaked at 1250 °C for 2 hours;<br>
3.	said ingots were hot rolled to plates with a final thickness of 12 mm over an<br>
approximate temperature range of 1200-900 °C;<br>
The preferred chemistry of the steel product thus obtained is as follows:<br>
Chemical composition of the steel (Weight percent) is provided in Table 1 hereunder:<br>
TABLE 1<br><br>
c	Si	S	P	Mn	Ni	Cr	Cu	Al<br>
0.10	0.19	0.025	0.116	0.88	0.34	0.48	0.47	0.006<br>
4.	Next, the strips of 150x25x12 mm were cut from the rolled plates for controlled<br>
rolling.<br>
5.	A 10 mm deep hole of 1.5 mm diameter was drilled in the centre of the length and<br>
thickness of the sample steel strips and a stainless steel sheathed (mineral<br>
insulated) chromel-alumel thermocouple was embedded into the hole so that the<br>
temperature of the steel could be recorded during controlled rolling of the steel.<br>
6.	The samples were next soaked at 1000 °C in a silicon carbide muffle furnace for 40<br>
minutes and were quickly removed from the furnace (along with the embedded<br>
9<br><br>
thermocouple) and were cooled in air to get to the temperature of either 900, 800<br>
and 740 °C, before rolling in single pass to the required reduction in thickness by<br>
either 25% or 50%.<br>
7.	The samples were then cooled in air after rolling. One sample was also air cooled,<br>
without any deformation, to room temperature as a controlled sample.<br>
8.	The tensile properties of all rolled samples were then evaluated with an Instron<br>
machine (model 1273) at a constant cross head speed of 2 mm/min. The YS, UTS<br>
and elongation achieved at 800 °C rolling temperature are 425 MPa, 535 MPa and<br>
27 % respectively. The measured hardness of steel is 160 VHN at this rolling<br>
temperature. These improved properties are achieved at lower rolling temperature,<br>
preferably at 800 °C, which are far superior as compared to existing SAILCOR.<br>
9.	The resulting alternative microstructures showing the mixed fine grains of ferrite,<br>
pearlite and the acicular ferrite are studied and micrographed. The optical and TEM<br>
micrographs of the steel samples are shown in accompanying Figure 1 and 2<br>
respectively. The accompanying Figure 1 clearly shows remarkable ferrite grain<br>
refinement at 800 °C rolling as the grain size reduces from 9.5 urn at 25 %<br>
deformation [1(a)], to 6 urn at 50 % deformation [1(b)]. Such experimental<br>
observation exhibits and confirms that the steel is amenable to thermomechanical<br>
treatment due to synergistic effect of higher Mn addition such as at least 0.88wt%<br>
in the multialloyed steel, even without microalloying such as element Nb, resulting<br>
in synergistically superior strength-ductility combination of the steel. Reference is<br>
now invited to accompanying Figure 2 that illustrates the presence and co-<br>
existence of pearlite lamellae (Fig. 2 a) and nonpolygonal ferrite with high<br>
dislocation density (Fig. 2 b) in the micrograph which is the characteristic of<br>
acicular ferrite.<br>
10<br><br>
It is thus possible by way of this invention to develop a process for obtaining steel of<br>
mixed microstructure comprising fine ferrite, pearlite and acicular ferrite in low alloy steel<br>
with higher Mn content (wt%) and maintaining suitable rolling parameters, even in<br>
absence of microalloying, such that the resulting steel exhibits improved properties of<br>
strength-ductility combination, Impact toughness and weldability apart from resistance to<br>
atmospheric corrosion as this steel is thermomechanically treatable. It is thus suitable for<br>
application in components/parts for fabrication of steel structures subjected to substantial<br>
forming or welding during processing or assembly.<br>

The invention further provide remarkable ferrite grain refinement at 800°C rolling as the<br>
grain size reduces from 9.5 μm at 25 % deformation to 6 μm at 50 % deformation. The<br>
steel is amenable to thermomechanical treatment even without microalloying due to<br>
synergistic effect of Mn rich multi-alloying.</td>
