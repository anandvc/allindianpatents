Introduction:<br>
Ironing or smoothing is the work of using a heated tool to remove wrinkles from washed clothes. The common tools for this purpose are called "irons', though modern designs are no longer made of iron.<br>
Ironing works by loosening the bonds between the long-chain polymer molecules in the fibres of the material. While the molecules are hot, the fibres are straightened by the weight of the iron, and they hold their new shape as they cool. Some fabrics, such as cotton, require the addition of water to loosen the intermolecular bonds. Many modern fabrics (developed in or after the mid-twentieth century) are advertised as needing little or no ironing. Ironing may also be used as a germ/parasite killing hygienic operation. Pressing the clothes is called ironing. Ironing or smoothing is the work of using a heated tool to remove wrinkles from washed clothes. The common tools for this purpose are called irons. Thus the process is given the name of ironing.<br>
History<br>
Pressing Machines Clothes is a process of ironing was first introduced in China. Metal pans filled with charcoal were used for smoothing fabrics in China in the 1st century BC. From the 17th century, sadirons or sad irons began to be used. They were thick slabs of cast iron, delta-shaped and with a handle, heated in a fire. A later design consisted of an iron box, which could be filled with hot coals, which had to be periodically aerated by attaching a bellows. This type was on sale in the USA until at least 1902. Due to the emergence of Electrical power the iron where heated using electricity as the energy source and the electrical power is used to provide the necessary heat through the conducting filament to the metal base. Because of the short circuiting and hazard to handle electrical element, the steam heating pressing iron had been into market, which uses water to generate steam at pressure and the pressurized steam is used to deliver heat to the metal base. The Steam generator is separate device which is mechanically or physically independent of the Iron pressing plate. The Steam Iron too depends on the electrical power for the generation of steam. The steam Iron<br><br>
later developed with water level gauge indicator and Steam ejector to have smooth ironing. Prior Art:<br>
The first Patent CA205795 in 1920 by BUSKARD SAMUEL G describes the Pressing Iron developed for the Pressing of clothes or fibres. Later several patents have been granted with various technical modifications. For instance, SunBeam Corporation filed many applications based on the said invention. The CA1015652, CA 1009946, CA780209, CA775220, CA773935, CA 765678, CA 723020, CA683333 describes the pressing iron of different configurations. As the advent of the electrical power CA 956567, CA 913520, CA 847655, CA 675006, CA 675005, CA659604, CA 659838 etc are the few of the invention based on the Electric Pressing Iron and their modifications. The CA 759315 describes the steam based pressing iron and the CA 785628 explains the use of water level gauge to indicate the water level. Besides the Patents, the commercial Coal fired iron Boxes in India serves to provide employment for many families. Besides household Iron box are available in the market, some of the public used to give their clothes to the pressing men for efficient pressing as the coal fired pressing are operated at higher temperature and more over due to heavy load of the pressing iron impart better smoothing. The laundry service people also offer to use the coal fired pressing iron because of the independency on electrical power. The Electric powered pressing irons are also been used in most of the laundry services, which have been proved to be costly because it relies on electrical power.<br>
Modern household and commercial irons uses a steam chest to generate steam and the steam is used to heat the metal base for pressing. The water level in the steam chest can be monitored and maintained a cautionary level.<br>
Description:<br>
The Machine was given the name Iron or Pressing Machines. Clothes as the earlier machines were made of iron though the modern irons are not made of<br><br>
iron. Modern machines are of two kinds manual and robotics. Modern irons available for sale to the consumers have some special features. The more expensive the models are the more features they have. Ejection of steam through the clothing during the use of Pressing machines clothes process; water reservoir inside the iron that is used for steam generation, an indicator showing the amount of water left in the reservoir; thermostat ensuring the maintenance of the constant temperature; a temperature control dial showing the range of possible temperatures are some of them. There are Automatic irons available in the market. Automatic Ironing robots like the Siemens AG Dress man have recently appeared in the market. Ironing may also be used as a germ/parasite killing hygienic operation. Ironing works by strengthening the bonds between the long-chain polymer molecules in the fibres of the material. While the molecules are hot, the fibres are straightened by the weight of the iron. They hold their new shape as they cool. Some fabrics, such as cotton, require the addition of water to loosen the intermolecular bonds. Coal fired Pressing Iron:<br>
In earlier days before electricity is been common, coal being available are used as a heating source for the Pressing Iron. Coals are obtained by burning the forest woods and other country woods. This coal being cheap source is been used in pressing iron, which has a hollow metal box with air holes. The coal is filled with an air gap in the said pressing iron and ignited using any hydrocarbon fuel. Once the coal if fired, the heat is dissipated to the metallic base and been used for smooth pressing.<br>
The advantage of such pressing iron is that it is portable, and can be carried anywhere. This advantage provides employment for several families in towns, villages and even cities. In India, Laundry service is offered by many organizations uses coal fired pressing iron because of it cheaper availability. The said pressing iron has the drawback of spread of ignition sparks to the fabrics and  also the availability of the coal  is  limited.  More over on<br><br>
consideration with the air pollution, the coal fired pressing iron had lost<br>
commercial value.<br>
Electric Pressing Iron:<br>
The use of electricity as the source of energy in the pressing iron has made a<br>
remarkable change in the household and commercial pressing iron. The<br>
Electrical energy is used to heat the filament element, which dissipates the<br>
heat energy to the metal base for pressing.<br>
The iron needs an electrical connection for the processing and more over it is<br>
simple. It has the drawback of electrical short circuiting, failure of the heating<br>
element and electrical short in case of leakage. This made it is tedious for the<br>
common public to install proper earthing system and periodical replacement<br>
of the electrical filament.<br>
Steam Pressing Iron:<br>
It is the advance form of electric pressing iron in which the electrical energy is<br>
used to derive pressurized steam in the steam chest and the steam is passed<br>
on to the conducting filament to dissipate heat to the metal base. The steam<br>
iron has some advance features of the indication of water level in the chest,<br>
pressure of steam and control of intensity of the electrical power.<br>
The said steam pressing iron is indirect conversion of the electrical energy to<br>
the steam energy and to deliver to the user. Hence the efficiency of the<br>
available heat energy is low.<br>
The above said drawbacks of the pressing iron are overcome by the present<br>
invention in which similar to the steam pressing iron instead of using the<br>
electrical power for the heat energy, the present invention used LPG as a<br>
source of energy to the pressing iron.<br>
The invention explains the Iron box comprising a metal base that is been<br>
commonly used which should be of high thermal conductivity, commercial<br>
LPG cylinder, a combustion chamber, a connection hose, a regulator for the<br>
controlled LPG supply, a control box to control the energy to the metal base.<br>
Since LPG is the locally available energy source and more over the scarcity<br>
of the coal fuel, environmental air standards limit the use. The LPG has very<br><br>
high calorific value and power dissipation to the metal base is high compared<br>
to the other commercial Pressing irons.<br>
The invention has following advantages:<br>
Energy Source: High calorific energy source compared to coal and electrical<br>
Power<br>
Flexibility:	LPG cylinder with the Pressing Iron are portable<br>
Cost Effective:   The cost on basis of the pressing cloth is cheaper compared<br>
to the coal or other fossil fuels, electricity.<br>

Detailed description of the Invention:<br>
The Invention of using LPG, as an energy source cannot be applied to the commercial coal fired pressing iron or electrical power steam pressing iron, as the internal of the Iron box using LPG needs internal modifications. The LPG fuel from the commercial LPG cylinder (L) being supplied through the hose (H) at the supply pressure is regulated using a regulator (R). The commercial LPG cylinder is of different capacity ranging from 5 kg to 18 kg. The connecting hose (H) is made of poly Teflon material of higher thermal resistance, to with stand high wear strength and also to prevent leakage. The hose (H) is internally reinforced with steel mesh wires to prevent damage to the said hose. The regulator (R) regulates the flow of the LPG to the mixer (B1) inside the control box (C). It also provides an ON/OFF control for the LPG flow to the mixer (B1) through the knob (K). The control box (C) is also provided with an air hole (A) to provide necessary oxygen supply to support combustion of the LPG inside the Combustion chamber (U). The sidewall (S) of the iron box has several holes (O) to provide necessary cooling in case of excess heat being transferred to the combustion chamber (U) and also means to exhaust the combustion product. The cooling is by natural air-cooling. The base metal plate (B) has the provision of triangular configured nuts (N) to bolt the top plate (T) to the said base with the sidewall (S) in between them to provide the necessary space for the Combustion Chamber (U).<br>
The Iron box (I) is made of the metal base (B) is made of thermally conductive metal alloys preferably bronze. The metal base (B) is of weight ranging from 1 to 1.5 kg based on the dimension of the triangular trimmed metal base. The base plate (B) is provided with triangularly configured nut (N) arrangement to connect the top plate (T) thereby accommodates the combustion chamber (U) with the sidewall (S).<br>
In the combustion chamber the LPG/Air mixture burns continuously and dissipate heat energy to the bottom base plate (B). The LPG/Air mixture flows<br><br>
through the combustion chamber (C) through a distributor (D) and gets ignited<br>
in the combustion chamber(C).<br>
As soon as the LPG smell is sensed in the vicinity of the combustion chamber<br>
(U), the LPG/Air mixture is ignited using Electronic Igniter or Safety Match<br>
box.<br>
The Iron box of present invention is used in laundry services and as well in<br>
pressing shops. It can also be used for commercial purposes and even for<br>
house hold in which case the LPG used for cooking can be connected to it.<br>
Now the invention can be explained in more detail with reference to the<br>
drawings.<br>
Figure 1  shows the earlier existing prior art of the Iron pressing using<br>
electrical energy. The system shows the plate being internally fixed with a<br>
heating filament, which is electrically powered (not shown). The Iron shows<br>
the two probes (P) being projected out to connect the two polarity of the<br>
electrical energy of 230 Volts AC supply.<br>
Figure 2 shows the complete setup of the present invention. The setup has<br>
the Iron box (I) configured with all internals and a connection hose (H) and<br>
LPG cylinder (L) with regulator (R). The Handle (E) is used to operate the iron<br>
to the required location of the cloth or fibres. It is rigidly fixed to the Top plate<br>
(T) of the Iron box (I).<br>
Figure 3 a shows the LPG Mixer setup consist of the mixer (B1) provided with<br>
the air holes (A) to mix the LPG fuel with the oxygen for better combustion.<br>
The combined mixture is then passed through a jet (J) into the combustion<br>
chamber (U) (not shown) by the distributor (D) (not shown) in the sidewall (S)<br>
(not shown).<br>
Figure 3 b shows the LPG fuel regulator setup with the knob (K) provided<br>
thereof to switch ON/OFF the LPG supply. The regulator is connected to the<br>
cylinder by the connecting hose (H).<br>
Figure 4 shows the bottom metal plate (B) with the triangular configured nut<br>
(N) arrangement to fix the top plate thereby accommodating the combustion<br>
chamber (U) (not shown).<br><br>
Figure 5 shows the sidewall (S) of the Iron (I) with the holes (O) in the sidewall. The holes (0) are distributed along the entire sidewall for cooling the hot exhaust gas and also provides a mean for the escape of the exhaust gas. Figure 6 shows the combined setup of the bottom plate (B) and sidewall (S) with the combustion chamber (U).<br>
Figure 7 shows combined setup of the bottom plate (B) and sidewall (S) with the combustion chamber (U). It also shows the provision of distributor (D) provided in the sidewall (S) for the supply of the LPG - oxygen mixture.<br><br><br><br><br>
