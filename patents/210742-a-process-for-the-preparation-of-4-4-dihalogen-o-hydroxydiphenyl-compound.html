A process for the preparation of 4,4'-dihaloaeno-hvclroxydiphenvl compounds<br>
The present invention relates to the preparation of 4,4'-diha(ogen-o-hydroxydiphenyl compounds of formula<br><br>
However, the yield obtained by this method of preparation is unsatisfactory as different chemical reactions may take place concurrently.<br>
Accordingly, this invention has for its object to provide an economic process for the preparation of 4,4'-dihalogen-o-hydroxydiphenyl compounds in which undesirable concurrent reactions are suppressed.<br>
This object is achieved in accordance with this invention by a three-step reaction, where in the first step either a) an alkoxyphenol of formula (6) is halogenated (a1), the resulting halo-genated phenol compound of formula (5) is reacted with p-dihalophenoi of formula (4b) in the presence of copper and/or copper salts to the diphenyl ether compound of formula (2)<br><br>
(a2) and the desired diphenyl ether compound of formula (1) is then obtained by ether fission (a3), or b) an alkoxyphenol of formula (6) is reacted with the halophenol of formula (4b) to the compound of formula (3) (b1), which compound is then halogenised (b2) and the resulting diphenyl ether compound of formula (2) is reacted by ether fission to the desired diphenyl ether compound of formula (1) (b3), in correspondence with the following reaction scheme:<br><br>
In the above scheme<br>
R1     is C1-C5aikyl;<br>
R2     is hydrogen; chloro or bromo; and<br>
Hail, Ha2 and Hals are each independently of one another a halogen atom.<br>
C1-C5Alkyl is branched or unbranched alkyl, such as methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl. sec-butyl, isobutyl, t-butyl, 2-ethylbutyl, or n-pentyl.<br>
In the above reaction scheme,<br>
Ri     is preferably C1-C4alkyl, more preferably methyl.<br>
Hall. Hal2 are preferably bromo and very particularly preferably chloro.<br>
Hal3 is preferably chloro or bromo.<br><br>
The halogenation of the alkoxyphenol of formula (6) to the phenol compound of formula (5) is preferably carried out using chlorine gas or sulfuryl chloride in the presence of an organic solvent, for example an aromatic, aliphatic or cycloaliphatic hydrocarbon, preferably with toluene or a xylene isomer mixture at a temperature in the range from -10 to 70°C, preferably from 20 to 35°C. The crude product of formula (5) so obtained is separated from the reaction mixture by neutralisation with sodium carbonate or potassium carbonate or by air being passed through the reaction mixture, the crude product of fonnula (5) then being collected by distillation under reduced pressure.<br>
The reaction of the halogenated phenol compound of formula (5) with the dihalogen compound of fomiula (4a) (reaction (a2)) and the reaction of the phenol compound of formula (6) with the dihalogen compound of formula (4b) (reaction (bi)) is usually carried out at temperatures in the range from 120 to 200, preferably from 130 to 170°C, it being possible for the phenol compound of formula (5) and for the dihalogen compound of formula (4a) or (4b) to be present in stoichiometric ratio and for the alkali hydroxide to be present in less than equivalent amount (20 to 80 % of theory).<br>
The copper catalysts used are preferably the copper salts conventionally used for the Ullmann synthesis, for example copper(ll) oxide, copper(l) oxide, copper carbonate, basic copper carbonate, copper(l) chloride, copper(ll) chloride, copper(l) bromide, copper(ll) bromide or copper sulfate.<br>
Further details on this reaction step are to be found in DE-OS-2,242,519.<br>
The ether fission (reaction (a3/b3)) is usually effected by treatment with AICI3 in an inert organic solvent, for example petroleum ether or benzene, or by heating with hydrobromic acid or mixtures of hydrobromic acid and acetic acid. The reaction time usually ranges from 0.5 to 10 hours and the temperature ranges from 40 to 110°C.<br>
The inventive reaction route a) (= a1/a2/a3) according to the following scheme is prefen^ed:<br><br><br>
The 4,4'-dihalogen-o-hydroxydiphenyl compounds prepared according to this invention are insoluble in water, but are soluble in dilute sodium hydroxide and potassium hydroxide solution and in virtually all organic solvents. Thanks to these solubility preconditions, they have very versatile applicability for fighting microorganisms, in particular bacteria, and for protecting organic materials and objects against microorganisms. These compounds can, for example, be applied to the human skin and hands and to hard objects in dilute or undiluted form together with e.g. wetting agents or dispersants, for example as soap or syndet solutions, for disinfection and cleansing.<br><br>
124 g of o-methoxyphenol and 200 ml of dry toluene are placed in a four-necked flask fitted with stirrer, condenser and dropping funnel.<br>
148 g of sulfuryi chloride are added dropwise, with stirring, over about 1 hour, the temperature of the reaction mixture being kept at 20 to 25°C. After the addition is complete, stirring is continued at room temperature for 2 hours, after which time the reaction mixture is trans-<br><br>
ferred to a separating funnel, shaken with 50 ml portions of 5% sodium carbonate solution,<br>
washed with 50 ml of water and dried over sodium sulfate. Subsequently, the sodium sulfate<br>
is removed by filtration and the chlorinated reaction product is subjected to distillation under<br>
reduced pressure.<br>
This yields 144 g of 2-methoxy-4-chlorphenol having a melting point of 128 to 134°C at<br>
1999.8 Pa Hg,<br>
Yield: 90.8 % of theory.<br><br>
198.3	g of 4-chloro-2-methoxyphenol (compound of formula (101)) are placed in a vessel<br>
together with 209 g of a xylene isomer mixture and the resulting mixture is heated to 80°C<br>
and charged with 27.5 g of (85%) KOH. This mixture is then heated to 145°C and 9.5 ml of<br>
water are separated in a water separator over 2 hours. After cooling to 100°C, 1 g of basic<br>
copper carbonate and 239.4 g of 4-bromochlorobenzene are added successively. After<br>
stirring for 2.5 hours at 144-150°C, the mixture is cooled to room temperature and the potas<br>
sium bromide fomied is removed by filtration.<br>
The solvent and the educts are then removed under vacuum. Distillation in an oil pump vacuum yields 67.6 g of a yellowish oil which quickly solidifies. Recrystallisation from petroleum ether yields a white, crystalline product of formula (102). m.p. = 72-73X.<br>
Example 3: Example 2 is repeated, but using 294 g of 1,4-dichlorobenzene instead of<br>
239.4	g of 4-bromochlorobenzene. After a reaction time of 5 hours at 148°C and after<br>
another 19 hours at 141°C and working up, the compound of formula (102) is obtained in a<br>
yield of 44 g.<br><br><br>
5.3 g of diphenyl ether of formuia (102) are made into a slurry in 50 ml of petroleum ether at 80 -1 lO°C and this slurry is then charged at room temperature with 6 g of anhydrous alu* minium chloride and heated to 80°C. This temperature is maintained, with thorough stirring, for 1.5 hours until the ether fission is complete. The reaction mixture is added to 100 ml of hydrochloric acid 2N, stirred for 15 minutes at about 70°C and subjected to phase separa* tion. The solvent phase is clarified by warm filtration and the product is crystallised first at 25°C and then for 1 hour at 5°C and is then dried, yielding 2.3 g of a pure, white, crystalline product of formula (103) having a melting point of 73 to 74°C.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
