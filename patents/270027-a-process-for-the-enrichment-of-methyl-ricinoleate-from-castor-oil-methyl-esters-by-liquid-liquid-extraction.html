				<td>Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a process for the enrichment of methyl ricinoleate (MR) from castor oil methyl esters (CME). Particularly, the present invention relates to a process for the extraction of methyl ricinoleate by a nondestructive extraction method with good yields (75 to 90%) and purity (95 to 99%). More particularly, the present invention relates to a process for the enrichment of methyl ricinoleate from castor oil methyl esters by liquid-liquid extraction (LLE) in presence of refined vegetable oils using an aqueous polar solvent.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
India is the major producer of castor (Ricinus communis., Euphorbiac&amp;a) oil and is a major exporter of the oil for value addition elsewhere. Castor oil is the only commercial source of unsaturated hydroxy acid (12-hydroxy-cis-9-octadecenoic acid) that is ricinolecic acid to the extent of 85-90% which is the feedstock for many of the useful Industrial chemicals. Castor oil and many of its derivatives are stabilized against oxidation by hydroxyl group which protects the double bond by preventing oxidation and reported to be four times more stable than olive oil. The glycerides of castor oil contains 2/3rd of triricinolein and the rest is di- and mono- ricinoleins. The high viscosity and specific gravity of the oil with solubility in alcohol and less solubility in petroleum solvent are added advantages.<br>
Castor oil is used in the manufacture of various products like undecenoic acid and heptaldehyde, hydrogenated castor oil (HCO), dehydrated castor oil (DCO), and its fatty acids, sulfated and sulphonated oil, sebacic acid and 2-octanol, ethoxylated oil, polyurethanes etc., Castor oil is also used in a wide range of cosmetics, toiletries and transparent soaps. Castor oil and its derivatives are also used in lubricating formulations. http://www.castoroil.in/ provides comprehensive resources related to castor plant, castor bean, castor oil, castor derivatives and castor-based oleochemicals. Many of the industrial castor-based chemicals are made either with castor oil/castor fatty acids or its methyl esters as such containing<br>
85-90% ricinoleic content. Enriched ricinoleic content with more hydroxyl value is an added advantage in preparation of many of the useful Industrial chemicals with desired properties.<br>
Attempts made by earlier researchers were not fruitful in enriching ricinoleic content in the castor oil/castor fatty acids to the desired extent. Achaya et al., worked in the fractionation of castor oil by LLE using petroleum ether into triricinolein, diricinolein and monoricinolein there by obtaining ricinoleic acid of enhanced purity with lesser yields. (K.T. Achaya, S.A. Salitore, J. Sci &amp; Ind. Res., 1952, vol 11, 471-474). In another attempt, castor oil was partitioned using acid washed hexane and the resulting triricinoleins were once urea-adducted to remove the bulk of non-hydroxy acids present and re-aducted to give ricinoleic acid of good quality in about 40% yield on the weight of the castor oil taken. {(Subramanyam V.V.R and Achaya K.T., J. Sci. Industr. Res. 20D (1961), 45)}. Another report describes a partition procedure for the preparation of ricinoleic acid of high purity in over 80% yield directly from castor oil fatty acids without the need for isolating triricinolein. {(K.J. Philip, P. Venkatrao and K.T. Achaya, Indian Journal of Technology, vol 1 No.11 (1963), 427-431)}. The mixed fatty acids of castor oil were partitioned using Gunstone's procedure {( Gunstone, F.D. J. Chem. Soc. (1954), 1611; Bharucha, K.E and Gunstone F.D., J. Chem. Soc., (1957), 610)} between petroleum ether (40-60Â°C) and 80% methanol which had been initially equilibrated with each other. The petroleum ether was taken in three separating funnels and the fatty acids added to the first along with methanol, after through shaking and settling the lower methanol layer was passed successively through the other two funnels. The first separating funnel was again extracted with fresh methanol which is then passed through the series. The same was done with two more lots of methanol. Finally the four methanol extracts and the three petroleum extracts were combined and the respective fatty acids isolated and analyzed (K.J. Philips et al. Indian Journal of Technology, vol 1 No. 11 (1963), 427-431)}. Hawke et al., reported that the mixed fatty acids drop rapidly in acid value and acetyl value by estolide formation even on standing for a few days at room temperature. {(Hawke F &amp;<br>
Kohll, E.A., J.S. Afr. Chem. Inst., 12 (1959), 1)}. They have recorded that holding the mixed fatty acids at room temperature for 6 weeks caused the acid value to fall from 185.8 to 122.7 and hydroxyl value from 180.8 to 119.6 (Hawke F et al.). It is also reported (K.J. Philips et al. Journal of Technology, vol 1 No.11 (1963), 427-431)} that the acid value of the extracted sample kept at 0Â°C for 5 weeks fell only by 2 units. Attempts to enrich the methyl esters of castor oil failed since these were miscible with hexane in all proportions. (K.J. Philips et al. Journal of Technology, vol 1 No. 11 (1963), 427-431)}. A paper describes the liquid-liquid equilibrium of castor oil+soybean oil+hexane ternary system (Tylisha M. Baber, Dung T. Vu and Carl. T. Lira, J. Chem. Eng. Data 2002, 47 1502-1505) at 298.15 K and reported as promising using hexane because of the significant difference between the castor oil and soybean oil K-ratios. (Ks &gt;1 and Kc

Detail description of the invention<br>
The present invention provides an efficient process for the enrichment of methyl ricinoleate from castor oil methyl esters by liquid-liquid extraction. The method consists of (a) mixing of the castor oil methyl esters in a refined normal vegetable oil in a defined proportion(feed) (b) liquid-liquid extraction (LLE) of the feed using an aqueous polar solvent to get an extract-1 and raffinate-1 (c) desolventization and drying of the extract-1 to get a solute of enriched methyl ricinoleate (d) further continuing the liquid-liquid extraction of the raffinate-1 with polar solvent at elevated temperature to get an extract-2<br>
(e) and recycling the left over raffinate-2 in the process. The ricinoleic content in the castor oil methyl esters is 85-90%<br>
The novel feature of the present invention is the selective liquid-liquid extraction of the methyl ricinoleate from castor oil methyl esters in a ternary system of castor oil methyl esters, refined normal vegetable oil and aqueous polar solvent.<br>
The refined normal edible or non-edible vegetable oils used is selected from the group consisting of sunflower, soybean, jatropha, karanja. The feed consists of properly mixed and defined proportion of castor oil methyl esters and refined normal vegetable oil.<br>
Another feature of the present invention is the selective liquid-liquid extraction of the feed in a non destructive way by aqueous polar solvent at 5-30Â°C, preferably at 10-20Â°C there by obtaining an extract-1 containing enriched methyl ricinoleate and a raffinate-1. The aqueous polar solvent used in the LLE process contains water to the extent of 5-30% preferably 10-20% for the selective extraction of methyl ricinoleate from the feed. The extraction is carried at atmospheric pressure and below the boiling point of the aqueous polar solvent.<br>
In yet another feature of the present invention the extract-1 is desolventized by simple distillation under reduced pressure and the obtained dried solute is the enriched methyl ricinoleate.<br>
In yet another feature of the present invention the raffinate-1 obtained by the liquid-liquid extraction of the feed is further extracted using the same polar solvent (anhydrous) at elevated temperature 40-60Â°C preferably at 45-55Â°C there by obtaining an extract-2 which on desolventization and drying can directly be used as biodiesel/oleochemical and the resulting raffinate-2 can be recycled in the process.<br>
The non-hydroxy fatty acid methyl esters of castor oil methyl esters are retained in the vegetable oil and can be used for the preparation of biodiesel or oelochemicals or reused in the process for the enrichment of methyl ricinoleate after removal of non-hydroxy fatty acid either by distillation under reduced pressure or further by liquid-liquid extraction using pure solvent. The<br>
enriched methyl ricinoleate will be useful for the preparation of several derivatives without the interference of non-hydroxy fatty acids.<br>
The liquid-liquid extraction and separation process is carried out using simple apparatus or equipment like separating funnels, centrifuge bottles &amp; centrifuge or using specially designed and fabricated semi continuous liquid-liquid extractors (Fig-1 &amp; Fig-2)<br>
Flow chart (PFD) herein given below explains the novel and simple liquid-liquid extraction process for the enrichment of methyl ricinoleate from castor oil methyl esters in a ternary system<br>

100g of the feed as in example 7 was continuously extracted with cooled 10% aqueous methanol v/v @ 4-5ml/min using a metering pump (1000 ml) in an extractor as in example 10 for a period of 4 hrs and there obtained an extract-1 after solvent removal and drying a solute 21.4g of MR of 95% GC purity was obtained. The obtained raffinate-1 was continued extracting with pure methanol (400ml) @ 4 ml/min at 45-55Â° C for period of 2 hrs and there obtained an extract-2 after desolventization and drying obtained a solute-2 of 10.0g showing a purity of MR 75% purity by GC. The dried left over raffinate-2 was 68.2g.<br>
EXAMPLE 13<br>
50g of enriched methyl ricinoleate of 96% GC purity obtained as in example 1 was mixed well again with 50g of refined sunflower oil in a 250 ml centrifuge bottle and 100ml of 10% aqueous methanol v/v was added and centrifuged at 20Â°C, 5000 rpm in a refrigerated centrifuge for 30 minutes. The upper solvent layer was selectively removed and the process was further repeated twice. The three extracts were pooled, solvent removed and dried as described earlier and analysed by GC. There obtained a solute of 47.3g of methyl ricinoleate of above 99.5% purity. The raffinate after solvent removal and drying was 52.2g which can be recycled back in the process.<br>
EXAMPLE 14<br>
400g of the feed containing CME and refined sunflower oil in the ratios of 1:2 was extracted with 10% aqueous methanol (v/v) @ 7.5 ml/min with a metering pump in a specially designed and fabricated 500ml capacity<br>
glass IICI-RAOKVSA liquid-liquid extractor-3 (Fig-2) at 20Â° C maintained with a Julabo circulator and hourly extracted samples were collected and were analysed by GC. After 12 hrs the total collected extracts were pooled (ca 5 Its), solvent was evaporated using a rotaevaporator and dried at reduced pressure 90-110Â°C and obtained a solute-1 (95.1g) showing MR purity of 96.8% by GC. The raffinate-1 was further continued extraction with pure methanol (ca.2.5 Its) @7.5ml/min at 50Â° C maintained with a julabo circulator for a period of 6 hrs and hourly extract samples were analysed by GC. From the methanol solubles, solvent was removed and dried as above and there obtained a solute of-2 (31.6g) MR of 75.2% purity. After desolventization and drying there left out a raffinate-2 was of 256.9g.<br>
A dag layer normally appeared at the interface of the oil and the solvent phase in all the quoted examples. The dag layer that appeared at the interface of this experiment was selectively removed and dried (11.3g) which on analysis by TLC showing similar composition as that of the feed/raffinate which is not affecting the efficiency of the extraction process.<br>
Table-1 gives the GC analysis data of the hourly extracts and also the original castor oil methyl esters (CME) composition used in the experiments. Samples of the Refined sunflower oil, Feed containing CME and sunflower oil &amp; Raffinate-2 were separately transesterified using sodium methoxide containing methanol as per the known methods and the isolated methyl esters were also analysed by GC under similar conditions. The data indicates the progress and the efficiency of the extraction process in fractionating the CME into a major high pure fraction and a minor low pure fraction in a non destructive way, thus illustrating in detail of our claims in a ternary liquid-liquid extraction process.<br>

Advantages<br>
The main advantages of the present invention are:<br>
1.	The fractionation of castor methyl esters using a single aqueous polar<br>
solvent in a ternary system of castor oil methyl esters (CME), any<br>
conventionally refined normal vegetable oil either edible or non edible<br>
oil  at ambient conditions  using  simple extraction  and  separation<br>
equipment and protocols resulting in enriching methyl ricinoleate to the<br>
extent of 95-99% with good yields (75-90%) and is highly promising for<br>
commercial exploitation.<br>
2.	Methyl ricinoleate is stable and storable for longer duration of time and<br>
is a better source for many of the ricinoleic based useful Industrial<br>
products.<br>
3.	The selective removal of the non hydroxyl fatty acids containing minor<br>
amounts of methyl ricinoleate supplement to biodiesel/oleochemical<br>
Industry.<br>
4.	This invention gives a double benefit of enrichment of hydroxyl ester<br>
from castor oil methyl esters on one hand and on the other hand the<br>
non   hydroxyl  ester  can   be   utilized  as  biodiesel/oleochemical,   a<br>
renewable,  non-petroleum-based source of chemical feedstock for<br>
value addition products<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
