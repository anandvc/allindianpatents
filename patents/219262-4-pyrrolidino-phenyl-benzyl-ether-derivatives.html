The invention relates to 4-pyrrolidino -phenyl-benzyl ether derivatives-   In particular  racemes or enantiomerically pure 4-pyrrolidino derivatives, processes for<br>
their preparation, pharmaceutical compositions comprising said derivatives, and their use in the prevention and treatment of illness.<br>
More particularly, the present invention relates to compounds of the formula I<br><br><br>
R" , R"', R"" and R   independently from each other are selected from the group consisting<br>
of hydrogen and halogen; R    is hydrogen;<br>
R’   is-CONHR’-CH2CN,-CNo’-NHR’; R    is hydrogen or Ci-Cs-alkyI; R’   is-C0-(Ci-C6)-alkyl or-S02-(Ci-C6)-alkyl; and n    is 0,1,2 or 3; as well as individual isomers, racemic or non-racemic mixtures thereof.<br>
It has been found that the compounds of general formula I and P as well as individual isomers, racemic or non-racemic mixtures thereof (hereinafter: Active Compounds) are selective monoamine oxidase B inhibitors.<br>
Monoamine oxidase (MAO, EC 1.4.3.4) is a flaking-containing enzyme responsible for the oxidative deamination of endogenouslnonoamine neurotransmitters such as dopamine, serotonin, adrenaline, or noradrenaline, and trace amines, e.g. phenylethyl-amine, as wet as a number of amine xenobiotics. The enzyme exists in two forms, MAO-A and A'lAO-B, encoded by different genes [Bach et al, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 85:4934-4938 (1988)] and differing in tissue distribution, structure and substrate specificity. MAO-A has higher affinity for serotonin, octopamine, adrenaline, and noradrenaline; whereas the natural substrates for MAO-B are phenylethylamine and t’'ramine. Dopamine is thought to be oxidised by both isoforms. MAO-B is widely distributed in several organs including brain [Cesura and Pletscher, Prog. Drug Research 38:171-297 (1992)]. Brain MAO-B activity appears to increase with age. This increase has been attributed to the gliosis associated with aging [Fowler et al., J. Neural. Transm. 49:1-20 (1980)]. Additionally, MAO-B activity is significantly higher in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease [Dostert et al, Bio-chem. Pharmacol. 38:555-561 (1989)] and it has been found to be highly expressed in astrocytes around senile plaques [Saura et al., Neuroscience 70:755-774 (1994)]. In this context, since oxidative deamination of primary monoamines by MAO produces NH3, aldehydes and H2O2, agents with established or potential toxicity, it is suggested that there is a rationale for the use of selective MAO-B inhibitors for the treatment of dementia and Parkinson's disease. Inhibition of MAO-B causes a reduction in the enzymatic inactivation of dopamine and thus prolongation of the availability of the neurotransmitter in dopa¬minergic neurons. The degeneration processes associated with age and Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases may also be attributed to oxidative stress due to increased MAO acti¬vity and consequent increased formation of H2O2 by MAO-B. Therefore, MAO-B inhibi-<br><br>
tors may act by both reducing the formation of oxygen radicals and elevating the levels of monoamines in the brain.<br>
Given the implication of MAO-B in the neurological disorders mentioned above, there is considerable interest to obtain potent and selective inhibitors that would permit control over this enzymatic activity. The pharmacology of some known MAO-B inhibitors is for example discussed by Bentue-Ferrer et al. [CNS Drugs 6:217-236 (1996)]. Whereas a major limitation of irreversible and non-selective MAO inhibitor activity isthe need to observe dietary precautions due to the risk of inducing a hypertensive crisis when dietary tyramine is ingested, as well as the potential for interactions with other medications [Gardner et al., J. Clin. Psychiatry 57:99-104 (1996)], these adverse events are of less concern with rever¬sible and selective MAO inhibitors, in particular of MAO-B. Thus, there is a need for MAO-B inhibitors with a high selectivity and without the adverse side-effects typical of irreversible MAO inhibitors with low selectivity for the en2yme.<br>

In accordance with the present invention, scheme 1 shows examplary routes to com¬pounds of the formula I, all starting from a compound of formula V. The reaction of a compound of formula V with a compound of formula VI [Ikuta et al., J. Med. Chem. 30:1995 (1987)] to obtain the intermediate of formula Ilia, maybe in inert solvents like dichloromethane, ethyl acetate or ethers in the presence of a base like triethylamine or carbonate and at a temperature in the range of from 0°C to 25°C. Cyclisation of the intermediate 2,4-dihalo-N-acyl derivative to the p’Trolidone Ilia may be with bases like sodium or potassium hydroxide in inert solvents like dichloromethane or ethers at a temperature of from 0°C to 25°C. Intermediates II wherein R* is H, i.e. compounds of formula Ila, are prepared by reacting a compound of formula V with 6,6-dimethyl-5,7-<br><br>

Another method to prepare compounds of formula I involves cross-coupling reactions of arylstannanes [Lam et al., Tetrahedron Lett. 43:3091 (2002)], arylboronates [Lam et al., Synlett 5:674 (2000); Chan et al, Tetrahedron Lett. 39:2933 (1998)] or aryl haUdes [Buch-wald et al., J.

In accordance with the present invention, a possibility to prepare compounds of general formula V, wherein -X-Y- is -CH2-O-, i.e. compounds of formula Va, is shown in scheme 3: The intermediates of formula XII are accessible through nucleophilic substitution of aromatic nitro compounds of formula XI containing p-substituted leaving groups with benzylic alcohols of formula X. Leaving groups in para-position can be, e.g., halogens (F, CI, Br, I), tosylates, mesylates or triflates. These substitution reactions can be conducted neat or in inert solvents like for example toluene or xylene. A preferred reaction<br><br>
temperature is in the range of from 50°C to 150°C. Alternatively, compounds of formula XII can be prepared by WiEiamson-ether synthesis, starting from p-nitrophenols XIV and benzylic halides, tosylates, mesylates or triflates of formula XIII. Bases used can be, e.g. alcoholates or carbonates (sodium, potassium or cesium carbonate). Examples for solvents include lower alcohols, acetonitrile or lower ketones at a temperature in the range of from 20°C to reflux temperature. Another approach is the Mitsunobu-coupling of benzylic alcohols with p-nitrophenols. The reaction is done as usual in inert solvents like for example diethyl ether or tetrahydrofurane, using dialkyl-azo-dicarboxylates in the presence of phosphines (for example tributyl- or triphenyl-phosphine).<br>
The key intermediates of formula XII are reduced to the amino compounds of formula Va using catalytic hydrogenation, like, e.g. using platinum on charcoal as the catalyst in lower alcohols, ethyl acetate or tetrahydrofurane. An alternative is the reduction of the nitro-group by metals lilce iron, tin, or zinc in acidic media like diluted hydrochloric acid or acetic acid. Metals can also be replaced by metal salts lilce, e.g., tin-(II)-chloride).<br>

In accordance with the present invention, a possibility to prepare the intermediates of formula Vb (wherein -X-Y- is -CH=CH-) and Vc (wherein -X-Y- is -CH2-CH2-) is shown in scheme 4: The intermediates of formula XVII are accessible by olefmation reac¬tion of optionally substituted aromatic aldehydes of formula XV with dialkyl (4-nitro-benzyl)-phosphonates of formula XVI in the presence of a base, like e.g. sodium hydride, yielding the corresponding nitro-olefins of formula XVII.<br>
Scheme 4<br><br>

The key intermediates of formula XVII can be reduced selectively to the amino-olefins of formula Vb using catalytic hydrogenation like e.g. using platinum on charcoal as the cata¬lyst in lower alcohols, ethyl acetate or tetrahydrofiirane as the solvent, or, by metals or metal salts, lilce e.g. tin-(II)-chloride. The amino derivatives of formula Vc can be obtained directly fi-om the nitro derivatives of formula XVII or fi:om the amino-olefins of formula Vb by hydrogenation using palladium on charcoal as the catalyst in lower alcohols, ethyl acetate or tetrahydrofiirane as the solvent.<br>
Intermediates II can be transformed into compounds of formula I using standard procedures. The acids II are activated via acid chloride (thionyl chloride or oxalyl chloride) or with DCC, EDC etc. and subsequently coupled with the amine R’-NH2. Alternatively, the corresponding alkyiesters can be transformed to intermediates II by aminolysis by ammes of formula R’-NH2.<br>
Intermediates III can be transformed into the desired compounds I wherein R is CN, i.e. compounds of formula lb, by reaction with sodium or potassium cyanide in solvents like N,N-dimethylformamide, acetone or acetonitrile at a temperature in the range of from 20°C to 140°C. Catalytic amounts of sodium or potassium iodide can be added to speed up "the"reaction (scheme 5).<br>
Scheme 5<br><br><br>

Compounds of formula IV can be obtained starting from acid derivatives of formula II by nucleophilic migrations from a carbon to a nitrogen atom, such as e.g. by Hofmann or Curtius rearrangement, via the formation of the corresponding isocyanate and its treat¬ment with suitable alcohols delivering the protected amino group, methods known per se from the literature (scheme 6). For the treatment of the intermediate isocyanate, alcohols are selected which yield the typical carbamates used as amine protecting groups, such as e.g. tert-butoxycarbonyl, benzyloxycarbonyl, or fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl. Their cleavage to the amine follows the protocols which are well known in the literature. The farther transformation to compounds of formula I can be performed by standard procedures, such as e.g. by reaction with activated acyl derivatives, e.g. acyl halogenides or anhydrides, or by condensation reactions of the acid using e.g. carbodiimides as condensation reagent, or by isocyanates.<br>

For the preparation of enantiopure derivatives of formula IV, an alternative route can be followed (scheme 7). Basically, the protocol follows the conditions described by Freidinger et al. [J. Org. Chem. 47:104-109 (1982)] where the aniline derivative of formula V is acyla-ted by an N-protected methionine derivative in its racemic or optically active form by standard conditions of condensation reactions to give compounds of formula XIX. Methylation with methyliodide or trimethyl-sulfonium or trimethylsulfoxonium salts and treatment of the resulting dimethyl-sulfonium salt with base, such as e.g. sodium hydride or lithium or potassium bis(trimethylsilyl)amide, in solvents inert under these conditions, e.g. THF, dichloromethane or N,N-dimethylformamide, yield the cyclised N-protected product of formula XX. Another variation of this cyclisation procedure is described in EP 985,665 which refers to a process for the preparation of 3-amino-2-oxo-pyrrolidines.<br>

In compounds of formula I or XX where -X-Y- has the meaning of-CHz-O-, the op¬tionally substituted benzyl residue can function as a transient group which can be cleaved by hydrogenolysis. The resulting phenols Id and XXa can then be re-alkylated by a dif¬ferent benzyl group under the aforementioned conditions. As known to those skilled in the art, this process is only possible on condition that R and PG are representing groups that are stable under the aforementioned reaction conditions for the hydrogenolysis and alkylation reaction.<br>
Compounds of general formula I can also exist in optical pure form. There ist the possibility to start with enantiopure compounds from the chiral pool, like e.g. (R)- or (S)-methionine. In other cases, separation into antipodes can be affected according methods known per se, either preferably at an early stage of the synthesis starting with compounds of formula II by salt formation with an optically active amine such as, for example, (-f-)- or (-)-l-phenylethylamine and separation of the diastereomeric salts by fractional crystallisation or preferably by derivatisation with a chiral auxiliary substance such as, for example, (+)- or (-)-2-butanol, (+)- or (-)-l-phenylethanol, or {+)- or (-)-menthol and separation of the diastereomeric products by chromatography and/or crystallisation and<br><br>
subsequent cleavage of the bond to the chiral auxiliary substance. In order to determine the absolute configuration of the pyrrolidinone derivative obtained, the pure diastereo-meric salts and derivatives can be analysed by conventional spectroscopic methods, with X-ray spectroscopy on single crystals being an especially suitable method.<br>
The Active Compounds are, as already mentioned above, monoamine oxidase B inhibitors and can be used for the treatment or prevention of diseases in which MAO-B inhibitors might be beneficial. These include acute and chronic neurological disorders, cognitive disorders and memory deficits. Treatable neurological disorders are for instance traumatic or chronic degenerative processes of the nervous system, such as Alzheimer's disease, other types of dementia, minimal cognitive impairment or Parkinson's disease. Other indica¬tions include psychiatric diseases such as depression, anxiety, panic attack, social phobia, schizophrenia, eating and metabolic disorders such as obesity, as well as the prevention and treatment of withdrawal syndromes induced by abuse of alcohol, nicotine and other addictive drugs. Other treatable indications maybe peripheral neuropathy caused by can¬cer chemotherapy (WO 97/33,572), reward deficiency syndrome (WO 01/34,172), or the treatment of multiple sclerosis (WO 96/40,095), and other neuroinflammatory diseases.<br>
The Active Compounds are especially useful for the treatment and prevention of Alzheimer's disease and senile dementia.<br>
The pharmacological activity of the compounds was tested using the following method:<br>
The cDNAs encoding human MAO-A and MAO-B were transiently transfected into EBNA cells using the procedure described by Schlaeger and Christensen [Cytotechnology 15:1-13 (1998)]. After transfection, cells were homogenised by means of a Polytron homogenizer in 20 mM Tris HCl buffer, pH 8.0, containing 0.5 mM EGTA and 0.5 mM phenylmethane-sulfonyl fluoride. Cell membranes were obtained by eentrifugation at 45,000 x g and, after two rinsing steps with 20 mM Tris HCl buffer, pH 8.0, containing 0.5 mM EGTA, mem¬branes were eventually re-suspended in the above buffer and aliquots stored at -80°C until use.<br>
MAO-A and MAO-B en2ymatic activity was assayed in 96-well-plates using a spectro-photometric assay adapted from the method described by Zhou and Panchuk-Voloshina [Analytical Biochemistry 253:169-174 (1997)]. Briefly, membrane ahquots were incubated in 0.1 M potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, for 30 min at 37°C containing different con¬centrations of the compounds. After this period, the enzymatic reaction was started by the addition of the MAO substrate tyramine together with 1 U/ml horse-radish peroxidase<br><br>
(Roche Biochemicals) and 80 |iM ]V-acet}d-3,7-dihydroxyphenoxazine (Amplex Red, Molecular Probes). The samples were further incubated for 30 min at 37°C in a final volume of 200 |il and absorbance was then determined at a wavelength of 570 nm using a SpectraMax plate reader (Molecular Devices). Background (non-specific) absorbance was determined in the presence of 10 |iM clorgyline for MAO-A or 10 jiM L-deprenyl for IvlAO-B. IC50 values were determined from inhibition curves obtained using nine inhibitor concentrations in dupHcate, by fitting data to a four parameter logistic equation using a computer program.<br>
The compounds of the present invention are specific MAO-B inhibitors. The IC50 values of preferred Active Compounds as measured in the assay described above are in the range of 1 |iM or less, typically 0.1 \iM or less, and ideally 0.02 ‘M or less.<br>
The Active Compounds can be used as medicaments, e.g. in the form of pharmaceutical preparations. The pharmaceutical preparations can be administered orally, e.g. in the form of tablets, coated tablets, dragees, hard and soft gelatine capsules, solutions, emulsions or suspensions. However, the administration can also be effected rectally, e.g. in the form of suppositories, or parenteraUy, e.g. in the form of injection solutions.<br>
The Active Compounds can be processed with pharmaceutically inert, inorganic or organic carriers for the production of pharmaceutical preparations. Lactose, corn starch or derivatives thereof, talc, stearic acid or its salts and the like can be used, for example, as such carriers for tablets, coated tablets, dragees and hard gelatine capsules. Suitable carriers for soft gelatine capsules are, for example, vegetable oils, waxes, fats, semi-solid and liquid polyols and the like; depending on the nature of the active substance no carriers are, how¬ever, usually required in the case of soft gelatine capsules. Suitable carriers for the produc¬tion of solutions and syrups are, for example, water, polyols, sucrose, invert sugar, glucose and the like. Adjuvants, such as alcohols, polyols, glycerol, vegetable oils and the like, can be used for aqueous injection solutions of water-soluble salts of Active Compounds, but as a rule are not necessary. Suitable carriers for suppositories are, for example, natural or hardened oils, waxes, fats, semi-liquid or liquid polyols and the like.<br>
In addition, the pharmaceutical preparations can contain preservatives, solubilizers, stabi¬lizers, wetting agents, emulsifiers, sweeteners, colorants, flavorants, salts for varying the osmotic pressure, buffers, masking agents or antioxidants. They may also contain other therapeutically valuable substances.<br><br>
As mentioned earlier, medicaments containing an Active Compound and a therapeutically inert excipient are also an object of the. present invention, as is a process for the pro¬duction of such medicaments which comprises bringing one or more Active Compound and, if desired, one or more other therapeutically valuable substances into a galenical dosage form together with one or more therapeutically inert carriers.<br>
The dosage can vary within wide limits and will, of course, be fitted to the individual requirements in each particular case. In general, the effective dosage for oral or parenteral administration is between 0.01-20 mg/kg/day, with a dosage of 0.1-10 mg/kg/day being preferred for all of the indications described. The daily dosage for an adult human being weighing 70 kg accordingly lies between 0.7-1400 mgper day, preferably between 7 and 700 mg per day.<br>
The following examples are provided for illustration of the invention. They should not be considered as limiting the scope of the invention, but merely as being representative there¬of The abbreviation „RT" means „room temperature".<br>
