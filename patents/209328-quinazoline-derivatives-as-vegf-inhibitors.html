[39 OF 1970]<br>
COMPLETE SPECIFICATION [See Section 10; rule 13]<br>
"QUINAZOLINE DERIVATIVES AS VEGF INHIBITORS"<br>
ASTRAZENECA AB, a Swedish company of S-151 85 Sodertalje, Sweden,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br><br>
The present invention relates to quinazoline derivatives, processes for their preparation, pharmaceutical compositions containing them as active ingredient, methods for the treatment of disease states associated with angiogenesis and/or increased vascular permeability, to their use as medicaments and to their use in the manufacture of medicaments for use in the production of antiangiogenic and/or vascular permeability reducing effects in warm-blooded animals such as humans.<br>
Normal angiogenesis plays an important role in a variety of processes including embryonic development, wound healing and several components of female reproductive function. Undesirable or pathological angiogenesis has been associated with disease states including diabetic retinopathy, psoriasis, cancer, rheumatoid arthritis, atheroma, Kaposi's sarcoma and haemangioma (Fan et al, 1995, Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 16: 57-66; Folkman, 1995, Nature Medicine 1: 27-3 i). Alteration of vascular permeability is thought to play a role in both normal and pathological physiological processes (Cullinan-Bove et al, 1993, Endocrinology 133: 829-837; Senger et al, 1993, Cancer and Metastasis Reviews, 12: 303-324). Several polypeptides with in vitro endothelial cell growth promoting activity have been identified including, acidic and basic fibroblast growth factors (aFGF &amp; bFGF) and vascular<br>
 endothelial growth factor (VEGF). By virtue of the restricted expression of its receptors, the growth factor activity of VEGF, in contrast to that of the FGFs, is relatively specific towards endothelial cells. Recent evidence indicates that VEGF is an important stimulator of both<br>
  normal and pathological angiogenesis (lakeman et al,1993, Endocrinology, 133: 848-859; Kolch et al, 1995, Breast Cancer Research and Treatment, 36:139-155) and vascular permeability (Connolly et al, 1989; J. Biol. Chem. 264: 20017-20024). Antagonism of VEGF<br>
   action by sequestration of VEGEawith antibody can result in inhibition of tumour growth (Kim et al, 1993, Nature 362: 841-844).<br>
Receptor tyrosine kinases~(RTKs) are important in the transmission of biochemical signals across the plasma membrane of cells. These transmembrane molecules characteristically consist of an extracellular ligand-binding domain connected through a<br>
   segment in the plasma memhcane to an intracellular tyrosine kinase domain. Binding of ligand to the receptor resultsin stimulation of the  receptor-associated tyrosine kinase activity which leads to phosphorylation of tyrosine residues on both the receptor and other intracellular<br><br>
molecules. These changes in tyrosine phosphorylation initiate a signalling cascade leading to a variety of cellular responses. To date, at least nineteen distinct RTK subfamilies, defined by amino acid sequence homology, have been identified. One of these subfamilies is presently comprised by the fms-like tyrosine kinase receptor, Fit or Fltl, the kinase insert domain-containing receptor, KDR (also referred to as Flk-1), and another fms-like tyrosine kinase receptor, Flt4. Two of these related RTKs, Fit and KDR, have been shown to bind VEGF with high affinity (De Vries et al, 1992, Science 255: 989-991; Terman et al, 1992, Biochem. Biophys, Res. Comm. 1992, 187: 1579-1586). Binding of VEGF to these receptors expressed in heterologous cells has been associated with changes in the tyrosine phosphorylation status of cellular proteins and calcium fluxes.<br>
Quinazoline derivatives which are inhibitors of VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase are described in International Patent Applications Publication Nos. WO 97/30035 and WO 98/1335C In WO 97/30035 and WO 98/13354 compounds are described which possess activity against VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase whilst possessing some activity against EGF receptor tyrosine kinase.<br>
Compounds of the present invention fall within the broad general disclosure of WO 97/30035 and WO 98/13354; We have found that compounds of the present invention possess very good inhibitory activity against VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase. Compounds of the present invention, which have been tested, show in vivo activity against a range of tumour xenografts in mice. Compounds of the present invention possess a beneficial toxicological profile when tested over 14 days in rats. Compounds of the present invention possess very good inhibitory activity against VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase show in vivo activity against a range of tumour xenografts in mice and possess a beneficial toxicological profile when tested over 14 days in rats.<br>
Compounds of the present invention inhibit the effects of VEGF, a property of value in the treatment of disease states associated with angiogenesis and/or increased vascular permeability such as cancer, diabetes, psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, Kaposi's sarcoma, haemangioma, acute and chronic nephropathies, atheroma, arterial restenosis, autoimmune diseases, acute inflammation, excessive scar formation and adhesions, endometriosis, dysfunctional uterine bleeding and ocular diseases with retinal vessel proliferation.<br>
Compounds of the present invention: possess good activity  againstrVEGF receptor tyrosine kinase whilst possessing some activity against EGF receptor tyrosine kinase.<br><br><br>
Furthermore, some compounds of the present invention, possess substantially higher potency against VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase than against EGF receptor tyrosine kinase or FGF Rl receptor tyrosine kinase. While we do not wish to be bound by theoretical considerations such compounds may for example be of interest in treating tumours which are associated with 5  VEGF, especially those tumours which are dependent on VEGF for their growth. It is further believed that these compounds may be of interest in treating tumour states associated with both VEGF and EGF, especially where a patient is suffering from a condition in which tumours are present which are dependent on both VEGF and EGF for their growth.<br>

of the quinazoline group.<br>
Within the present invention it is to be understood that a compound of the formula I or a salt thereof may exhibit the phenomenon of tautomerism and that the formulae drawings within this specification can represent only one of the possible tautomeric forms. It is to be<br>
20 understood that the invention encompasses any tautomeric form which inhibits VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase activity and is not to be limited merely to any one tautomeric form utilised within the formulae drawings.<br>
It is also to be understood that certain compounds of the formula I and salts thereof can exist in solvated as well as unsolvated forms such as, for example, hydrated forms. It is to be<br>
25  understood that the invention encompasses all such solvated forms which inhibit VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase activity.<br>
For the avoidance of any doubt, it is to be understood that in a compound of the formula I when R2 is, for example, a group of formula C^alkenylR3 it is the C25alkenyl moiety which is bound to X1 and an analogous convention applies to other groups. When R2<br>
30 is a group 1 -R3prop-l -en-3-yl it is the first carbon to which the group R3 is attached and it is -the third carbon which is linked to X1, similarly when R2 is_a_group„2-R3pent-3-en-5-yl it is<br><br><br>
the second carbon to which the group R3 is attached and it is the fifth carbon which is linked to X1, and an analogous convention applies to other groups.<br>
Compounds of Formula I may be administered in the form of a prodrug which is broken down in the human or animal body to give a compound of the Formula I. Examples of 5  prodrugs include in vivo hydrolysable esters of a compound of the Formula I.<br>
Various forms of prodrugs are known in the art. For examples of such prodrug derivatives see:<br>
a)        Design of Prodrugs, edited by H. Bundgaard, (Elsevier, 1985) and Methods in Enzymology, V6l~32, p. 309-396;edited by K. Widder, et al. (Academic Press, 1985); 10 b)        A Textbook of Drug Design and Development, edited by Krogsgaard-Larsen and H. Bundgaard, Chapter 5 "Design and Application of Prodrugs", by H. Bundgaard p. 113-191(1991);<br>

An in vivo hydrolysable ester of a compound of Formula I containing a hydroxy group includes inorganic esters such as phosphate esters (including phosphoramidic cyclic esters) and a-acyloxyalkyl ethers and related compounds which as a result of the in vivo hydrolysis of the ester breakdown to give the parent hydroxy group/s. Examples of a-acyloxyalkyl<br>
20  ethers include acetoxymethoxy and 2,2-dimethylpropionyloxy-methoxy. A selection of in vivo hydrolysable ester forming groups for hydroxy include alkanoyl, benzoyl, phenylacetyl and substituted benzoyLand phenylacetyl, alkoxycarbonyl (to give alkyl carbonate esters), dialkylcarbamoyl and N-(dialkylaminoethyl)-N-alkylcarbamoyl (to give carbamates), dialkylaminoacetyl and carboxyacetyl: Examples of substituents on benzoyl include<br>
25  morpholino and piperazino linked from a ring nitrogen atom via a methylene group to the 3-or 4- position of the benzoyl ring.<br>
The present invention relates to the compounds of formula I as hereinbefore defined as well as to the salts thereof. Salts for use in pharmaceutical compositions will be pharmaceutically acceptable salts, but other salts may be useful in the production of the<br>
30  compounds of formula I and theirpharmaceutically acceptable salts. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the invention may, for example, include acid addition salts of the compounds of formula I as hereinbefore defined which are sufficiently basic to form such salts.<br><br>
Such acid addition salts include for example salts with inorganic or organic acids affording pharmaceutically acceptable anions such as with hydrogen halides (especially hydrochloric or hydrobromic acid of which hydrochloric acid is particularly preferred) or with sulphuric or phosphoric acid, or with trifluoroacetic, citric or maleic acid. In addition where the 5  compounds of formula I are sufficiently acidic, pharmaceutically acceptable salts may be formed with an inorganic or organic base which affords a pharmaceutically acceptable cation. Such salts with inorganic or organic bases include for example an alkali metal salt, such as a sodium or potassium salt, an alkaline earth metal salt such as a calcium or magnesium salt, an ammonium salt or for example a salt with methylamine, dimethylamine, trimethylamine,<br>
10 piperidine, morpholine or tris-(2-hydroxyethyl)amine.<br>
A compound of the formula I, or salt thereof, and other compounds of the invention (as hereinafter defined) may be prepared by any process known to be applicable to the preparation of chemically-related compounds. Such processes include, for example, those illustrated in European Patent Applications, Publication Nos. 0520722, 0566226, 0602851 and 0635498 and<br>
15  in International Patent Applications Publication Nos. WO 97/22596, WO 97/30035, WO<br>
97/32856 and WO 98/13354. Such processes, are provided as a further feature of the invention and are as described hereinafter. Necessary starting materials may be obtained by standard procedures of organic chemistry. The preparation of such starting materials is described within the accompanying non-limiting Examples. Alternatively necessary starting materials are<br>
20 obtainable by analogous procedures to those illustrated which are within the ordinary skill of an organic chemist.<br>
Thus the following processes (a) to (d) and (i) to (iv) constitute further features of the present invention. Synthesis of Compounds of Formula I<br>
25	(a) Compounds of the formula I and salts thereof may be prepared by the reaction of a<br>
compound of the formula HI:<br><br><br>
(wherein R2 and X1 are as defined hereinbefore and L1 is a displaceable moiety), with a compound of the formula IV:<br><br>
10  (wherein R1 and m are as defined hereinbefore) whereby to obtain compounds of the formula and salts thereof. A convenient displaceable moiety L1 is, for example, a halogeno, alkoxy (preferably C,.4alkoxy), aryloxy or sulphonyloxy group, for example a chloro, bromo, methoxy, phenoxy, methanesulphonyloxy or toluene-4-sulphonyloxy group.<br>
The reaction is advantageously effected in the presence of either an acid or a base.<br>
15   Such an acid is, for example, an anhydrous inorganic acid such as hydrogen chloride. Such a base is, for example, an organic amine base such as, for example, pyridine, 2,6-lutidine, collidine, 4-dimethylaminopyridine, triethylamine, morpholine, N-methylmorpholine or diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene, or for example, an alkali metal or alkaline earth metal carbonate or hydroxide, for example sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate, calcium<br>
20  carbonate, sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide. Alternatively such a base is, for example, an alkali metal hydride, for example sodium hydride, or an alkali metal or alkaline earth metal amide, for example sodium amide or sodium bis(trimethylsilyl)amide.

10<br><br>
(wherein R2, X1 and A1 are as hereinbefore defined) to yield a compound of formula XII as hereinbefore defined. The reduction of the nitro group may conveniently be effected by any of the procedures known for such a transformation. The reduction may be carried out, for<br>
15   example, by the hydrogenation of a solution of the nitro compound in the presence of an inert solvent or diluent as defined hereinbefore in the presence of a metal effective to catalyse hydrogenation reactions such as palladium or platinum. A further reducing agent is, for example, an activated metal such as activated iron (produced for example by washing iron powder with a dilute solution of an acid such as hydrochloric acid).

(XVH)<br>
10<br>
(wherein X1 and L2 are as hereinbefore defined and P1 represents a phenolic hydroxy protecting group). The choice of phenolic hydroxy protecting group P1 is within the standard knowledge of an organic chemist, for example those included in standard texts such as "Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis" T.W. Greene and R.G.M.Wuts, 2nd Ed. Wiley 1991, including ethers<br>
15  (for example, methyl, methoxymethyl, allyl and benzyl and benzyl substituted with up to two substituents selected from C1-4alkoxy and nitro), silyl ethers (for example, t-butyldiphenylsilyl and t-butyldimethylsilyl), esters (for example, acetate and benzoate) and carbonates (for example, methyl and benzyl and benzyl substituted with up to two substituents selected from C1-4alkoxy and nitro). Deprotection may be effected by techniques well known in the<br>

The removal of such a phenolic hydroxy protecting 	group may be effected by any of the<br>
procedures known for such a transformation, including those reaction conditions indicated in standard texts such as that indicated hereinbefore, or by a related procedure. The reaction<br>
25   conditions preferably being such that the hydroxy derivative is produced without unwanted reactions at other sites within the starting or product compounds. For example, where the protecting group P1 is acetate, the transformation may conveniently be effected by treatment of the quinazoline derivative with a base as defined hereinbefore and including ammonia, and its mono and di-alkylated derivatives, preferably in the presence of a protic solvent or co-solvent<br>

One compound of formula in may if desired be converted into another compound of fonnula HI in which the moiety L1 is different. Thus for example a compound of formula HI in which L1 is other than halogeno, for example optionally substituted phenoxy, may be converted to a compound of formula HI in which L1 is halogeno by hydrolysis of a compound 5  of formula III (in which L1 is other than halogeno) to yield a compound of formula X as hereinbefore defined, followed by introduction of halide to the compound of fonnula X, thus obtained as hereinbefore defined, to yield a compound of formula III in which L' represents halogeno.<br>

The identification of compounds which potently inhibit the tyrosine kinase activity 20 associated with the VEGF receptorsfsuch as Fit and/or KDR and which inhibit angiogenesis and/or increased vascular permeability is desirable and is the subject of the present invention. These properties may be assessed for  example, using one or more of the procedures set out below:<br>
25  (a) In Vitro Receptor Tyrosine Kinase Inhibition Test<br>
This assay determines the. ability of a test compound to inhibit tyrosine kinase activity. DNA encoding VEGF or epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor cytoplasmic domains may be obtained by total gene synthesis (Edwards M, International Biotechnology Lab 5(3), 19-25, 1987) or by cloning. These may then be expressed in a suitable expression system to obtain<br>
30 polypeptide with tyrosine kinase-activity. For example VEGF and EGF receptor cytoplasmic domains, which were obtained by expression of recombinant protein in insect cells, were found to display intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity. In the case of the VEGF receptor Fit (Genbank<br><br>
accession number X51602), a 1.7kb DNA fragment encoding most of the cytoplasmic domain, commencing with methionine '783 and including the termination codon, described by Shibuya et al (Oncogene, 1990, 5: 519-524), was isolated from cDNA and cloned into a baculovirus transplacement vector (for exainple pAcYMl (see The Baculovirus Expression System: A 5 Laboratory Guide, L.A. King and R. D. Possee, Chapman and Hall, 1992) or pAc360 or pBlueBacHIs (available from Invitrogen Corporation)). This recombinant construct was co-transfected into insect cells (for example Spodoptera frugiperda21(Sf21)) with viral DNA (eg Pharmingen BaculoGold) to prepare recombinant baculovirus. (Details of the methods for the - assembly of-recombinant DNA moiecuiesand the'preparation and use of recombinant 10 baculovirus can be found in standard texts for example Sambrook et al, 1989, Molecular cloning - A Laboratory Manual, 2nd edition, Cold Spring Harbour Laboratory Press and O'Reilly et al, 1992, Baculovirus Expression Vectors - A Laboratory Manual, W. H. Freeman and Co, New York). For other tyrosine kinases for use in assays, cytoplasmic fragments starting from methionine 806 (KDR, Genbank accession number L04947) and methionine 668<br>
15  (EGF receptor, Genbank accession number X00588) may be cloned and expressed in a similar manner.<br>
For expression of cFlt tyrosine kinase activity, Sf21 cells were infected with plaque-pure cFlt recombinant virus at a  multiplicity of infection of 3 and harvested 48 hours later. Harvested cells were washed with ice cold phosphate buffered saline solution (PBS) (10mM<br>
20 sodium phosphate pH7.4, 138mM sodium chloride, 2.7mM potassium chloride) then<br>
resuspended in ice cold HNTG/PMSF (20mM Hepes pH7.5, 150mM sodium chloride, 10% v/v glycerol, 1% v/v Triton X100, L5mM magnesium chloride, ImM ethylene glycol-bis(Paminoethyl ether) N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid (EGTA), ImM PMSF (phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride); the PMSF is added just before use from a freshly-prepared<br>
25  lOOmM solution in methanol) using 1ml HNTG/PMSF per 10 million cells. The suspension was centrifuged for 10 minutes at 13,000 rpm at 4°C, the supernatant (enzyme stock) was removed and stored in aliquots at -70°C. Each new batch of stock enzyme was titrated in the assay by dilution with enzyme diluent (100mM Hepes pH 7.4, 0.2mM sodium orthovanadate, 0.1% v/v Triton X100, 0.2mM dithiothreitol). For a typical batch, stock enzyme is diluted 1 in<br>
30 2000 with enzyme diluent and 50µl of dilute enzyme is used for each assay well.<br><br>
A stock of substrate solution was prepared from a random copolymer containing tyrosine, for example Poly (Glu, Ala, Tyr) 6:3:1 (Sigma P3899), stored as 1 mg/ml stock in PBS at -20°C and diluted 1 in 500 with PBS for plate coating.<br>
On the day before the assay 100µl of diluted substrate solution was dispensed into all 5  wells of assay plates (Nunc maxisorp 96-well immunoplates) which were sealed and left overnight at 4°C.<br>
On the day of the assay the substrate solution was discarded and the assay plate wells<br>
were washed once with PBST (PBS containing 0.05% v/v Tween 20) and once with 50mM<br>
        HepespH7.4.<br>
10	Test compounds were diluted with 10% dimethylsulphoxide (DMSO) and 25µl of<br>
diluted compound was transferred to wells in the washed assay plates. "Total" control wells contained 10% DMSO instead of compound. Twenty five microlitres of 40mM manganese(IJ.)chloride containing 8uM adenosine-5'-triphosphate (ATP) was added to all test wells except "blank" control wells which contained manganese(II)chloride without ATP. To 15  start the reactions 50ui of freshly diluted enzyme was added to each well and the plates were incubated at room temperature for 20 minutes. The liquid was then discarded and the wells were washed twice with PBST. One hundred microlitres of mouse IgG anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (Upstate Biotechnology Inc. product 05-321), diluted 1 in 6000 with PBST containing 0.5% w/v bovine serum albumin (BSA), was added to each well and the plates were incubated 20 for 1 hour at room temperature before discarding the liquid and washing the wells twice with PBST. One hundred microlitres of horse radish peroxidase (HRP)-Iinked sheep anti-mouse Ig ^antibody (Amersham product NXA 931), diluted 1 in 500 with PBST containing 0.5% w/v<br>
BSA, was added and the plates were incubated for 1 hour at room temperature before ■".' discarding the liquid and washing the wells twice with PBST. One hundred microlitres of 2,2'-25  azino-bis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulphonic acid) (ABTS) solution, freshly prepared using one 50mg ABTS tablet (Boehringer 1204 521) in 50ml freshly prepared 50mM phosphate-citrate buffer pH5.0 + 0.03% sodium perborate (made with 1 phosphate citrate buffer with sodium perborate (PCSB) capsule (Sigma P4922) per 100ml distilled water), was added to each well. Plates were then incubated for 20-60 minutes at room temperature until the optical density .30 value of the "total" control wells, measured at 405nm using a plate reading spectrophotometer, was approximately 1.0. "Blank" (no ATP) and "total" (no compound) control values were used to determine the dilution range of test compound which gave 50% inhibtion of enzyme activity.<br><br>
(b)	In Vitro HUVEC Proliferation Assay<br>
This assay determines the ability of a test compound to inhibit the growth factor-stimulated proliferation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC).<br>
HUVEC cells were isolated in MCDB 131 (Gibco BRL) + 7.5% v/v foetal calf serum (FCS) and were plated out (at passage 2 to 8), in MCDB 131+ 2% v/v FCS + 3µg/ml heparin + lµg/ml hydrocortisone, at a concentration of 1000 cells/well in 96 well plates. After a minimum of 4 hours they were dosed with the appropriate growth factor (i.e. VEGF 3ng/ml, EGF 3ng/ml or b-FGF 0.3ng/ml) and compound. The cultures were then incubated for 4 days at 37°C withr7.5% carbon dioxide on day  the ltures were pulsed with lµ.Ci/well of tritiated-thymidine (Amersham product TRA 61) and incubated for 4 hours. The cells were harvested using a 96-well plate harvester (Tomtek) and then assayed for incorporation of tritium with a Beta plate counter. Incorporation of radioactivity into cells, expressed as cpm, was used to measure inhibition of growth factor-stimulated cell proliferation by compounds.<br>
(c)	In Vivo Solid Tumour Disease Model<br>
This test measures the capacity of compounds to inhibit solid tumour growth.<br>
CaLu-6 tumour xenografts were established in the flank of female athymic Swiss nu/nu mice, by subcutaneous injection of 1x10s CaLu-6 cells/mouse in 100p.l of a 50% (v/v) solution of Matrigel in serum free culture medium. Ten days after cellular implant, mice were allocated to groups of 8-10, so as to achieve comparable group mean volumes. Tumours were measured using vernier calipers and volumes were calculated as: (1 x w) x V(l x w) x (TI/6) , where 1 is the longest diameter and w the diameter perpendicular to the longest diameter. Test compounds were administered orally once daily for a minimum of 21 days, and control animals received compound diluent. Tumours were measured twice weekly. The level of growth inhibition was calculated by comparison of the mean tumour volume of the control group versus the treatment group, and statistical significance determined using a Students' t-test and/or a Mann-Whitney Rank Sum Test. The inhibitory effect of compound treatment was considered significant when p
The toxicological profile of compounds of the present invention may be assessed, for example using a rat 14 day study as described hereinafter.<br><br>
(dl 14 Pay Toxicity Test in Rat<br>
This test measures the activity of compounds in increasing the zone of hypertrophy in<br>
the femoral epiphyseal growth plates of the distal femur and proximal tibia, and allows<br>
assessment of histopathological changes in other tissues.<br>
5	Angiogenesis is an essential event in endochondral ossification during long bone<br>
elongation, and vascular invasion of the growth plate has been suggested to depend upon VEGF production by hypertrophic chondrocytes. Expansion of the hypertrophic chondrocyte zone and inhibition of angiogenesis has been demonstrated following treatment with agents           which specifically sequester VEGF, such as, for example, (i) a soluble VEGF receptor<br>
10  chimeric protein (Flt-(l-3)-IgG) in mice (Gerber, H-P., Vu, T.H., Ryan, A.M., Kowalski, J., Werb, Z. and Ferrara, N. VEGF couples hypertrophic cartilage remodelling, ossification and angiogenesis during endochondral bone formation, Nature Med., 5: 623-628, 1999) and (ii) a recombinant humanised anti-VEGF monoclonal IgGl antibody in cynomologus monkey (Ryan, A.M., Eppler, D.B., Hagler, K.E., Bruner, R.H., Thomford, P.J., Hall, R.L., Shopp,<br>
15   G.M. and CNiell, C.A. Preclinical Safety Evaluation of rhuMAbVEGF, an antiangiogenic humanised monoclonal antibody, Tox. Path., 27: 78-86, 1999).<br>
An inhibitor of VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase activity should therefore also inhibit vascular invasion of cartilage, and increase the zone of hypertrophy in the femoral epiphyseal growth plates of the distal femur and proximal tibia in growing animals.<br>
20	Compounds were initially formulated by suspension in a 1% (v/v) solution of<br>
polyoxyethylene (20) sorbitan mono-oleate in deionised water, by ball-milling at 4°C overnight (at least 15 hours). Compounds were re-suspended by agitation immediately prior fo dosing. Young Alderley Park rats (Wistar derived, 135-150g in weight, 4 to 8 weeks of age, 5-6 per group) were dosed once-daily by oral gavage for 14 consecutive days with<br>
25  compound (at 0.25 ml/lOOg body weight) or vehicle.   On day 15 animals were humanely<br>
terminated using a rising concentration of carbon dioxide, and a post-mortem performed.  A<br>
range of tissues, which included femoro-tibial joints, were collected and processed by<br>
standard histological techniques to produce paraffin wax sections. Histological sections were<br>
. stained with haematoxylin and eosin and examined by light microscopy for histopathology.<br>
30 The femoral epiphyseal growth plate areas of the distal femur and proximal tibia were measured in sections of femur and tibia using morphometric image analysis. The increase in the zone of hypertrophy was determined by comparison of the mean epiphyseal growth plate<br><br>
area of the control group versus the treatment group, and statistical significance determined using a one-tailed Students' t-test. The inhibitory effect of compound treatment was considered significant when p
Although the pharmacological properties of the compounds of Formula I vary with 5  structural change, in general, activity possessed by compounds of the Formula I, may be demonstrated at the following concentrations or doses in one or more of the above tests (a), (b), (c) and (d):<br>
Test (a):-        IC50 in the range, for example,

Test (d):-        activity in the range, for example, 0. l-100mg/kg.<br>
According to one aspect of the present invention compounds of Formula I, assessed in<br>
the 14 day toxicity test in rat, have a beneficial toxicological profile over other compounds<br>
within the scope of International Patent Application Publication No. WO 98/13354.<br>
15	According to another aspect of the present invention compounds of Formula I,<br>
assessed in the 14 day toxicity test in rat, have a beneficial toxicological profile over other compounds within the scope of International Patent Application Publication No. WO 97/30035.<br>
Although the pharmacological properties of the compounds* of Formula I vary with 20  structural change and between species, at doses in the rat, preferably at doses less than or equal to 150mg/kg, more preferably at doses less than or equal to lOOmg/kg, especially at doses less than or equal to 50mg/kg, compounds of Formula I which produce a statistically significant increase in the femoral epiphyseal growth plate area of the distal femur and/or proximal tibia, produce no unacceptable histopathological changes in other tissues in tests (d) 25 that we have conducted.<br>
Thus by way of example, the compound 4-{4-bromo-2-fluoroanilino)-6-methoxy-7-(l-methylpiperidin-4-ylmethoxy)quinazoline, (Example 2), tested according to (a), (b), (c) and (d) above gave the following results:<br>
(a)	Flt-IC50 of l.6µM<br>
30	KDR-IC50 of 0.04µM<br>
EGFR-IQ50 of 0.5µM<br>
(b)	VEGF - IC30 of 0.06µM<br><br>
EGF-IC50  of 0.017µM Basal-IC50 of &gt;3µM (c)       78% inhibition of tumour growth at 50mg/kg; p
