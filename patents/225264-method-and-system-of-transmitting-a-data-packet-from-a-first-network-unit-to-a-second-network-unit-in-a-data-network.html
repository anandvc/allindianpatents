				<td>Description<br>
The invention relates to the transmission of a data packet in a data<br>
network.<br>
Such transmission of a data packet in a data network is known from [1].<br>
Generally an information unit, which is made available in the data<br>
network by an information supplier, is transmitted in a data network to<br>
a user by the information supplier.<br>
In a packet-based data network, for example an IP data network, the<br>
information unit is transmitted in the form of a data packet. In graphic<br>
terms, the information unit is "packaged" in the form of a packet, in<br>
this case a data packet, and transmitted with the data packet.<br>
Generally such a data packet is provided with what is known as a label<br>
or header, comparable to an address, which specifies as a minimum a<br>
destination address for transmission of the data packet.<br>
Fig. 2 shows such an IP data network 200 and transmission of a data<br>
packet 210 in diagrammatic form.<br>
The organization of such an IP data network 200 is also known from [1]<br>
or [3].<br>
A data packet 210 is also described in [1] or [3] .<br>
In order to ensure that a data packet is also transmitted to the user in<br>
the data network, for whom it is intended, the user must use a network<br>
service, which is supplied by a network unit, known as a gateway or<br>
router.<br>
Such a router 220 and 221 is also shown in Fig. 2 and known from [2].<br>
A network service generally routes a data packet in the data network and<br>
thereby ensures that the data packet is also transmitted to the user<br>
requesting it.<br>
A user can use network services from different network units in a data<br>
network.<br>
All data packets to be transmitted to the user are transmitted to a<br>
network unit, which then transmits these on to the user.<br>
If a user, for example a mobile telephone 230 (see Fig. 2) is not yet in<br>
the data network, in this case a mobile communication network 200 to<br>
which said user requires access, the user must first establish a<br>
connection with a network unit, the router 221 and 220, in the data<br>
network.<br>
The mobile telephone 230 does this by dialing in or logging on to the<br>
mobile communication network 200 and being connected as a result to a<br>
network unit 221, in the range of influence of which the mobile<br>
telephone 230 is currently located (home access router 221).<br>
The network unit, to which the mobile telephone originally dials in or<br>
logs on, is referred to as the home access router 221.<br>
This dialing in or logging on process is, for example, carried out in<br>
accordance with a point to point protocol or a dynamic host<br>
configuration protocol, as described in [4] or [5] .<br>
When a mobile telephone dials in or logs on to a mobile communication<br>
network, what are known as connection parameters, for example,<br>
transmission quality or a security mechanism, are agreed or defined<br>
between the mobile telephone and the competent network unit.<br>
Such connection parameters are described in [4] or [5].<br>
Also during the log-on process, the mobile telephone is assigned a fixed<br>
address, known as an IP address.<br>
This address is valid, as long as the mobile telephone 230 is logged on.<br>
to the competent network unit, the home access router 221.<br>
If a mobile telephone wishes to or has to change network unit, for<br>
example because the mobile telephone changes its geographical position<br>
and as a result moves from the range of influence of an original first<br>
network unit (home access router 221) into the range of influence of a<br>
new second network unit (foreign access router 220), the connection set<br>
up between the mobile telephone and the original first network unit 221<br>
must be terminated and a new connection must be set up with the new<br>
second network unit 220.<br>
When the new connection is set up, the mobile telephone logs on again to<br>
the new network unit. The connection parameters and the IP address must<br>
be newly defined or agreed. Only than is the correct transmission of a<br>
data packet to the mobile telephone ensured.<br>
All the connection parameters defined during the original connection are<br>
lost.<br>
The invention has to resolve the problem of specifying a method and<br>
arrangement which improve the transmission of a data packet in a data<br>
network to a user changing from a first network unit to a second network<br>
unit in the data network.<br>
The problem is resolved by means of the method and arrangement according<br>
to the respective independent Claim.<br>
In the case of a method for transmitting a data packet from a first<br>
network unit to a second network unit in a data network, transmission<br>
takes place to the first network unit. A connection is established<br>
between the first network unit and the second network unit using the<br>
first connection information unit. A second connection information unit<br>
is assigned to the data packet from the first network unit. The data<br>
packet is then transmitted from the first network unit to the second<br>
network unit using the second connection information unit.<br>
An arrangement for transmitting a data packet in a data network has a<br>
first network unit, a second network unit and a connection between the<br>
first network unit and the second network unit, which connection<br>
can be established using a first connection information unit, which<br>
first connection information unit was transmitted to the first network<br>
unit. The first connection unit is established in such a way that a<br>
second connection information unit can be assigned to the data packet.<br>
Also the first network unit and the second network unit are established<br>
in such a way that the data packet can be transmitted from the first<br>
network unit to the second network unit in the data network using the<br>
second connection information unit.<br>
The arrangement is particularly appropriate for implementation of the<br>
method according to the invention or a development described after this.<br>
The particular advantage of the invention is that certain existing<br>
connection parameters can be retained. Certain connections in the data<br>
network can therefore be maintained even when the network unit changes.<br>
It should be pointed out that a connection can refer to both a physical<br>
and a virtual connection.<br>
Preferred developments of the invention result from the dependent<br>
Claims.<br>
The developments described below relate both to the method and to the<br>
arrangement.<br>
The invention and the developments described below can be implemented by<br>
means of both software and hardware, for example using a special<br>
electrical circuit.<br>
Also the invention or a development described below can be implemented<br>
using a computer-readable storage medium, on which a computer program is<br>
stored, which executes the invention or development.<br>
Also the invention and/or any development described below can be<br>
implemented by means of a computer program product, which has a storage<br>
medium, on which a computer program is stored, which executes the<br>
invention and/or development.<br>
The connection between the first and second network units can be<br>
established if the first connection information unit contains at least<br>
one of the following information units:<br>
- a data network management information unit,<br>
- a security information unit,<br>
- a quality information unit,<br>
- a cost information unit,<br>
- a user information unit,<br>
- a destination information unit.<br>
It should however be pointed out that the above list of information<br>
units should hot be seen as exhaustive but that the first connection<br>
information unit may contain further information units.<br>
For secure transmission of the data packet to a destination unit, for<br>
example a communication terminal, the second connection information unit<br>
is preferably an address.<br>
Such an address may be a Multi-Protocol-Label-Switching address (MPLS<br>
label).<br>
For a more precise definition of a transmission characteristic in the<br>
data network, the address can preferably be linked with at least one of<br>
the following information units:<br>
- a data network management information unit,<br>
- a security information unit,<br>
- a quality information unit,<br>
- a cost information unit,<br>
- a user identification information unit,<br>
- a destination information unit<br>
- a tunnel information unit<br>
- a data transmission information unit.<br>
It should however be pointed out that the above list of information<br>
units is not exhaustive but that the address may be linked with other<br>
information units.<br>
The information units may also be coded and contained in the address in<br>
code form or stored in a list.<br>
The second connection information unit may be assigned only temporarily<br>
to the data packet. It is therefore expedient to assign the second<br>
connection information unit to the data packet in the first network unit<br>
(labeling). The second connection information unit is separated from the<br>
data packet again in the second network unit (delabeling).<br>
Establishment of the connection can be understood to mean that the<br>
connection is newly established using the first connection information<br>
unit or that an already established connection is newly configured using<br>
the first connection information unit.<br>
In one embodiment the connection comprises a plurality of sub-<br>
connections. In this case, the connection runs from the first network<br>
unit to the second network unit via intermediate network units. It is<br>
also conceivable that these sub-connections might connect the first<br>
and second network units in parallel. A combination of the two options,<br>
parallel or in series, is also conceivable.<br>
The first and second network units and also the intermediate network<br>
units may be what are known as routers, switches or gateways.<br>
In a development, the connection and/or the sub-connection is a tunnel.<br>
Such a tunnel may specifically be a Multi-Protocol-Label-Switching<br>
Label-Switched-Path tunnel (MPLS LSP tunnel).<br>
In one embodiment the data network is an IP communication network.<br>
In an IP communication network, the data packet is generally transmitted<br>
from a data source via one or more network units, which route the packet<br>
further on, to a communication terminal, for example a mobile telephone.<br>
In the process, the communication terminal is logged on to a network<br>
unit assigned to the communication terminal, known as a home access<br>
router. Generally the communication terminal is also connected to this<br>
home access router.<br>
If however the'communication terminal is connected to a "foreign"<br>
network unit, known as a foreign access router, to which the<br>
communication terminal has not logged on, and the communication terminal<br>
does not log on again to this foreign access router, the data packet can<br>
generally not be transmitted securely from the data source to the<br>
communication terminal.<br>
In such a case, it is useful to deploy a development of the invention<br>
for transmission of the data packet, as this increases the level of<br>
security during transmission.<br>
This makes it possible for the first connection information unit to be<br>
transmitted to the first network unit from the second network unit or<br>
the communication terminal or a third unit in the data network.<br>
With this development, the data packet is transmitted from the data<br>
source to the first network unit, on via the connection to the second<br>
network unit and then to the communication terminal.<br>
The transmission route may also be reversed.<br>

in more detail below.<br>

Embodiment: Data transmission in an IP data network<br>
Fig. 1 shows the structure of an IP data network 100 with associated<br>
components for transmitting a data packet 101 in the IP data network<br>
100.<br>
The structure according to Fig. 1 does not show a minimal configuration<br>
of the IP data network 100. Various components are solely intended to<br>
enhance user-friendliness. They are however not necessary for the<br>
operation of the IP data network 100.<br>
This IP data network 100 is organized and structured according to a<br>
layer model, which is described in [6].<br>
The components of the IP data network 100 according to Fig. 1 described<br>
below are for the most part standard components of an IP data network,<br>
which are generally known to the person skilled in the art.<br>
Fig. 1 shows the IP data network 100, which contains a data source 110,<br>
for example a database, a first 130 and a second 131 router, a gateway A<br>
130 and a gateway B 131.<br>
The routers 130, 131 are each connected to the data source 110 by means<br>
of data lines 140, 141, via which the data packet 101 can be transmitted<br>
in the IP data network 100.<br>
Fig. 1 shows a mobile communication terminal 150, a mobile telephone<br>
150.<br>
The mobile telephone 150 is logged on to the first router 130. The first<br>
access router 130 is in this case described as what is known as a home<br>
access router 130.<br>
When the mobile telephone 150 logs on to the home access router 130, the<br>
home access router 130 assigns what is known as an IP number to the<br>
mobile telephone 150.<br>
The IP numbers assigned for this purpose are uniquely "routable" in the<br>
IP data network 100 [2].<br>
This IP number is used to make the mobile telephone accessible for the<br>
IP data network 100 on layer 3.<br>
Fig. 1 also shows that the mobile telephone 150 has left the range of<br>
influence of the home access router 130 and is now in the range of<br>
influence of the second access router 131, known as a foreign access<br>
router 131.<br>
Data packets are transmitted between the mobile telephone 150 and the<br>
foreign access router 131 according to the layer model, which is<br>
described in [6].<br>
Fig. 1 also shows what is known as a Multi-Protocol-Label-Switching<br>
Label-Switched-Path tunnel (MPLS LSP tunnel) 160, which connects the<br>
home access router 130 to the foreign access router 131.<br>
Basic features of an MPLS LSP tunnel are known from [7].<br>
To set up this MPLS LSP tunnel 160 between the foreign access router 131<br>
and the home access router 130, connection information units are<br>
transmitted from the foreign access router 131 to the home access<br>
router.<br>
The connection information units are used to define the configuration of<br>
the MPLS LSP tunnel 160 to be established.<br>
The following is defined:<br>
the transmission route a data packet 101 has to take between the<br>
home access router 130 and the foreign access router 131,<br>
-the security standards to be complied with for a transmission<br>
between the home access router 130 and the foreign access router<br>
131 in the MPLS LSP tunnel 160,<br>
- the quality standards to be complied with for a transmission<br>
between the home access router 130 and the foreign access router<br>
131 in the MPLS LSP tunnel 160 (quality of service),<br>
- the label to be used to mark a data packet 101 transmitted between<br>
the home access router 130 and the foreign access router 131 in<br>
the MPLS LSP tunnel 160,<br>
- the speed with which a data packet 101 is to be transmitted<br>
between the home access router 130 and the foreign access router<br>
131 in the MPLS LSP tunnel 160,<br>
- the costs to be charged for transmission of a data packet between<br>
the home access router 130 and the foreign access router 131 in<br>
the MPLS LSP tunnel 160.<br>
Other connection information units, for example information units<br>
relating to the mobile telephone 150 and/or the data source 110, which<br>
can also be used to configure the MPLS LSP tunnel 160, can also be<br>
transmitted from the foreign access router 131 to the home access router<br>
130.<br>
It should be noted that these information units do not necessarily have<br>
to be transmitted from the foreign access router 131 to the home access<br>
router but can also be transmitted from a third unit, for example the<br>
mobile telephone 150.<br>
It should also be pointed out that the connection information units<br>
described should not be seen as exhaustive.<br>
The connection information units also indicate to the home access router<br>
130 that the mobile telephone 150 is in the range of influence of the<br>
foreign access router 131.<br>
This means that data packets, which are transmitted between the IP data<br>
network 100 and the mobile telephone 150, have to be transmitted to the<br>
foreign access router 131 and be routed on from this to the mobile<br>
telephone 150.<br>
The MPLS LSP tunnel is established according to the defined<br>
configuration.<br>
The transmission of a data packet 101 between the data source 110 and<br>
the mobile telephone 150 is described below.<br>
a) Transmission of a data packet 101 from the mobile telephone 150 to<br>
the data source 110<br>
If the mobile telephone 150 requests an information unit from the data<br>
source 110, a corresponding request data packet is transmitted from the<br>
mobile telephone 150 to the data source 110.<br>
For this, the request data packet is provided or addressed in the mobile<br>
telephone with a destination address, which defines the data source 110<br>
as the transmission destination.<br>
The addressed data packet is transmitted from the mobile telephone 150<br>
to the foreign access router 131 according to the layer model. The<br>
addressed data packet is analyzed in the foreign access router 131 and<br>
routed on or transmitted further.<br>
During the further transmission of the addressed data packet to the data<br>
source 110 the addressed data packet must be routed on by other routers<br>
as required.<br>
Fig. 1 shows a direct connection, the data line 141, via which the<br>
addressed data packet is transmitted to the data source 110, for<br>
simplification only.<br>
At the end of the transmission the request data packet reaches the data<br>
source 110. It is analyzed there. The request is processed.<br>
b) Transmission of a data packet 101 from the data source to the<br>
mobile telephone 150<br>
The data source 110 compiles a response data packet, which is sent back<br>
to the mobile telephone 150.<br>
The response data packet is provided or addressed with the IP number as<br>
the destination address, which defines the mobile telephone 150 as the<br>
transmission destination.<br>
The addressed response data packet is transmitted from the data source<br>
110 to the home access router 130 first.<br>
Fig. 1 shows a direct connection, the data line 140, via which the<br>
response data packet is carried to the home access router 130, for<br>
simplification only.<br>
Transmission via a plurality of different routers would be possible.<br>
The home access router 130 was informed, when the MPLS LSP tunnel was<br>
set up, that the mobile telephone 150 is currently in the range of<br>
influence of the foreign access router 131.<br>
The home access router 130 therefore "knows" that it has to route or<br>
transmit the response data packet, which is intended for the mobile<br>
telephone 150, further on to the foreign access router 131.<br>
For the transmission of the response data packet between the home access<br>
router 130 and the foreign access router 130, the home access router 130<br>
provides the response data packet with what is known as an MPLS LSP<br>
label.<br>
Such an MPLS LSP label is described in [7].<br>
In graphic terms, the response data packet is temporarily, i.e. only for<br>
transmission between the home access router 130 and the foreign access<br>
router 131, re-addressed to the foreign access router 131. The original<br>
destination address, the IP number of the mobile telephone, is retained<br>
but is temporarily masked by the MPLS LSP label.<br>
This MPLS LSP label is linked with the following information units:<br>
- a data network management information unit,<br>
- a security information unit,<br>
- a quality information unit,<br>
- a cost information unit,<br>
- a user identification information unit,<br>
- a destination information unit<br>
- a tunnel information unit<br>
- a data transmission information unit.<br>
It should be pointed out that the information units described, which are<br>
linked with the MPLS LSP label, should not be seen as exhaustive. Other<br>
links are possible.<br>
The information units are coded in the form of a numerical code.<br>
The response data packet "addressed" with the numerical code or MPLS LSP<br>
label is transmitted via the MPLS LSP tunnel 160 from the home access<br>
router 130 to the foreign access router 131.<br>
The MPLS LSP label is again separated from the response data packet in<br>
the foreign access router 131. The response data packet again has the<br>
original destination address, the IP number of the mobile telephone 150.<br>
According to the layer model, the response data packet is transmitted<br>
from the foreign access router 131 to the mobile telephone 150.<br>
At the end of the transmission the response data packet reaches the<br>
mobile telephone 150. It is analyzed and "unpacked" there, making user<br>
data available to the mobile telephone 150.<br>
It should be noted that the transmissions described above are carried<br>
out on the basis of known transmission standards. Corresponding known<br>
data protocols are used.<br>
Fig. 3 shows a flow diagram with a method flow 300, which describes<br>
diagrammatically the interaction of individual components in an IP data<br>
network during transmission of a data packet.<br>
The IP data network contains a mobile unit 310, described in Fig. 3 as<br>
mobile node MN, a foreign access router 320, a home access router 330<br>
and what is known as a correspondent host (data source) 340.<br>
The mobile node 310 is logged on to the home access router 330 but is<br>
located in a range of influence of the foreign access router 320.<br>
In this case, the mobile node 310 informs the foreign access router 320<br>
that it is in its range of influence and must therefore use a network<br>
service of the foreign access router 320 for transmission of a data<br>
packet (location update 350).<br>
The foreign access router 320 for its part now informs the home access<br>
router 310 that the mobile node is in its range of influence and<br>
therefore a data packet, which is intended for the mobile node 310 and<br>
has been transmitted to the home access router 330, has to be routed on<br>
to the foreign access router (location update plus +, 351).<br>
The foreign access router 320 also sends connection information units to<br>
the home access router 330, which can be used to set up an MPLS LSP<br>
tunnel between the foreign access router 320 and the home access router<br>
330 (location update plus +, 351).<br>
In further stages 360 and 362 the MPLS LSP tunnel is set up according to<br>
the connection information units (MPLS LSP tunnel establishment, 360 and<br>
backward MPLS LSP tunnel establishment, 362).<br>
The foreign access router 320 informs the mobile node 310 that a<br>
connection has been established between the mobile node 310 and the IP<br>
data network (hand over/change over OK, 361) .<br>
During transmission of a data packet from the mobile node 310 to the<br>
correspondent' host 340, the data packet is transmitted in one stage 370<br>
from the mobile node 310 to the foreign access router 320.<br>
The data packet is routed on from the foreign access router 320 and<br>
transmitted to the correspondent host 340 (stage 373 and stage 374 or<br>
stage 371 and stage 372).<br>
This transmission can take place via two different transmission routes:<br>
a) The data packet receives a label from the foreign access router<br>
320 and this label shows the home access router 330 as the<br>
destination address. The data packet is then transmitted via the<br>
MPLS LSP tunnel to the home access router 330. The label is again<br>
removed from the data packet at the home access router 330 (stage<br>
371) .<br>
The data packet is transmitted on to the correspondent host 340 from the<br>
home access router 330 (stage 372).<br>
b) The data packet is transmitted directly from the foreign access<br>
router 320 (without going via the home access router 330) to the<br>
correspondent host 340 (stage 373 and stage 374) .<br>
A data packet, which is transmitted back from the correspondent host 340<br>
to the mobile node 310, is transmitted in one stage 37 5 from the<br>
correspondent host 340 to the home access router 330 (stage 375).<br>
At the home access router 330 the data packet receives a label (stage<br>
376), which shows the foreign access router 320 as the destination<br>
address.<br>
The label contains further information units, known as connection<br>
information units, which are used for transmission via the MPLS LSP<br>
tunnel.<br>
The "labeled" data packet is then transmitted from the home access<br>
router 330 via the MPLS LSP tunnel to the foreign access router 320<br>
(stage 376).<br>
The label is again separated from the data packet at the foreign access<br>
router 320 (stage 376).<br>
In a further stage 377 the data packet is transmitted from the foreign<br>
access router 320 to the mobile node 310 (stage 377).<br>
Fig. 4 is a diagrammatic illustration of the mobility of a mobile unit<br>
420 between a plurality of routers 410 in an IP data network 400.<br>
The IP data network 400 shown in Fig. 4 has the same functionality as<br>
the IP data network according to the embodiment shown in Fig. 1.<br>
MPLPS LSP tunnels as described above can also be set up as required<br>
between the routers 410 shown in Fig. 4.<br>
Fig. 4 shows a number of routers 410 in the IP data network 400. A<br>
mobile unit, in this case a mobile host 420, is also shown.<br>
Arrows 430 show the mobility of the mobile host 420. The mobile host 420<br>
changes its position according to the arrows 430 and as a result moves<br>
into the range of influence of different routers 410.<br>
In order to ensure secure data transmission between a data source and<br>
the mobile host 420, without the host having to log on to every new<br>
access router 410, log off from the old access router 410 and each time<br>
define new connection parameters, an MPLS LSP tunnel according to the<br>
previous embodiments is established or used in each instance between the<br>
(fixed) home access router and the current foreign access router.<br>
Data, which is exchanged between the mobile host 420 and the data<br>
source, is transmitted via these tunnels.<br>
In graphic terms, the access routers 410 are networked by the MPSL<br>
tunnels. The mobile host 420 can be "handed over" from one router 410<br>
to another router 410 in any changes between different routers 410.<br>
