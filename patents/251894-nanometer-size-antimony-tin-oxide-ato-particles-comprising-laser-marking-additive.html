ADDITIVE<br>
This application claims priority to Provisional Applications U.S. 60/518,483, filed<br>
November 7, 2003, and U.S. 60/605,888, filed August 30, 2004.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is directed to a low visibility laser marking additive and the<br>
particular use of such additive for applying markings to a variety of plastic articles and<br>
coatings.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
A number of printing techniques for applying markings to articles, including screen<br>
printing and transfer printing, are well known. These are generally surface printing<br>
methods which means that the identification mark realized can become unreadable<br>
through mechanical damage, abrasion, chemical influences, and the like. Such printing is<br>
particularly difficult to apply to curved or textured surfaces and the special tooling costs<br>
required add to the overall cost of the product.<br>
The labeling of products is becoming of increasing importance in virtually all<br>
sectors of industry. Thus, for example, production dates, use-by dates, bar codes,<br>
company logos, serial numbers, etc., must frequently be applied. At present, these<br>
marks are predominantly made using conventional techniques such as printing,<br>
embossing, stamping, and labeling. However, the importance of non-contact, very rapid<br>
and flexible marking using lasers, in particular in the case of plastics, is increasing. This<br>
technique makes it possible to apply graphic inscriptions, for example bar codes, at high<br><br>
speed even on a non-planar surface. Since the inscription is in the plastic article itself, it<br>
is durable and abrasion-resistant.<br>
The desirability of marking articles through the use of a laser system is well<br>
known. Lasers have been developed so that the beam impinged on the article to be<br>
marked can be highly focused to provide fine lines in the form of letters and/or numbers<br>
of the desired size, as well as images. Lasers permit the marking to be on the surface of<br>
the article or beneath the surface. In many instances, it is desirable to have the mark<br>
disposed subsurface in order to make ft more difficult to remove the indication. Such a<br>
subsurface mark, can for example, contribute to anti-counterfeiting efforts. Laser<br>
marking, whether surface or subsurface, has also been used, for example, for<br>
electronically scanning and control purposes during production.<br>
A number of laser beam processes in which an identification mark is burned into<br>
the surface of an article part are known. The resulting rough surface usually has to be<br>
coated with a transparent lacquer on account of the danger of contamination and the<br>
unpleasant feel that results. This can become a very involved operation in the case of<br>
mass produced parts and adds to the cost of the product.<br>
The use of laser beam marking systems for creating subsurface marks is also<br>
known. Such systems are based on creating the mark by having the article to be marked<br>
be composed of a special configuration of materials or incorporating a material within the<br>
article which either becomes visible when exposed to the laser beam or causes<br>
something else present to become visible.<br>
For example, U.S. Patent No. 4,822,973 discloses a system in which the laser<br>
beam passes through the surface of a first plastic material in order to be absorbed in a<br>
layer of a second plastic material. This system requires a special configuration of<br>
materials of construction in the part to be marked. Other systems incorporate a quantity<br><br>
of carbon black, coatecl or uncoated "silicate containing" materials such as rnica, talc, or<br>
kaolin, or a highly absorbing green pigment, all of which absorb energy from the laser<br>
beam to produce a visible mark. However, these materials have a degree of color or<br>
import a hazy quality to the plastic which is sufficient to be visible prior to application of<br>
the laser beam and that can be unsightly or interfere with the distinctness of the mark<br>
after the laser beam has been applied. This disadvantaging characteristic is aggravated<br>
by the fact that these additives tend to require a high loading content into the article to be<br>
marked, which is not only undesirable because of the effect on appearance but also can<br>
effect the physical and mechanical properties of the object. Further, absorbance of the<br>
laser beam to cause local heating also causes a degree of foaming which may detract<br>
from the creation of a fine and distinct dark mark, resulting in a blemished product.<br>
Typically, the additives tend to be specific to the wavelength emitted by the laser.<br>
For example, laser marking materials initially developed for use in conjunction with<br>
carbon dioxide lasers tend not to work particularly well (or even at all) with the<br>
increasingly popular yttrium aluminum garnet (YAG) lasers which require a material<br>
which absorbs at 1064 nm.<br>
In commonly assigned, U.S. Patent No. 6,693,657, issued February 17, 2004, a<br>
novel YAG laser marking additive (MARK-ITâ„¢) and its use is described. The YAG laser<br>
marking additive is a calcined powder of co-precipitated mixed oxides of tin and<br>
antimony. When the powder absorbs YAG laser energy and converts it into heat,<br>
carbonization of the surrounding material occurs and results in the formation of a black or<br>
dark mark that contrasts to the remainder of the surrounding area. Because of the<br>
particle size of the powder and its efficiency, the powder does not impart an appreciable<br>
amount of color to the object in which it is incorporated. It also does not cause excess<br>
foaming so that the mark achieved is smoother in texture.<br><br>
Laser marking additives render polymers laser markable by acting as a light<br>
absorber for the laser light. Materials that act in this capacity often absorb visible light as<br>
well, which imparts a color to the piece to be marked. The color can be in contrast to the<br>
desired color of the piece, or it may dilute the desired color. The additive may also<br>
reduce clarity of a transparent piece. An appearance change can also be due to<br>
scattering of light by the additive. This can happen whether the additive has color or not.<br>
As a result, laser marking additives must be used in low concentrations, and/or not used<br>
in transparent applications.<br>
It is therefore an object of this invention to provide a laser marking additive which<br>
will produce a black or dark mark contrasting with the surrounding area when exposed to<br>
laser energy but prior thereto does not impart an appreciable color to the surrounding<br>
area or cause a significant change in the performance of the material in which it has<br>
been added. Traditional additives cause transparent polymers to appear hazy, as such<br>
polymers lose optical clarity and are no longer crystal clear.<br>
This invention produces a laser marking additive that does not change the color or<br>
appearance of articles at equivalent loadings to normal laser marking additives, and<br>
retains the laser markability of the piece. Moreover, optical clarity of clear and<br>
transparent polymers is maintained.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention produces a laser marking additive which does not change the color<br>
or appearance of articles, including optical clarity, and retains the laser markability of the<br>
piece. The laser marking additives are particularly useful in processes for marking<br>
plastic articles, including transparent plastic components, as well as for marking applied<br>
polymeric coatings or inks. Polymers incorporating the additive material of this invention<br><br>
lasermark readily with lasers. Transparent polymers maintain initial optical clarity and do<br>
not look hazy upon incorporation and laser marking of the article formed therefrom. The<br>
laser marking additives of this invention retain the absorptivity of the laser light, a key<br>
requirement of laser marking additives, by retaining the absorption coefficient at the laser<br>
wavelength. What is reduced is the scattering power of the pigment. The scattering<br>
power is the component that determines the visibility of the pigment in the piece. The<br>
scattering power of the additive of the invention is reduced by making the particle size of<br>
the additive extremely small, i.e., nano-sized. In this invention, the laser marking additive<br>
is less than 100 nm in size.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
In the laser marking methods of the invention, any laser that has readily<br>
adjustable variable parameters that govern laser energy characteristics, such as pulse<br>
content, pulse duration and pulse frequency, may be employed. Preferably, the laser has<br>
a wavelength in the near infrared (780 nm to 2000 nm), the visible range (380 nm to 780<br>
nm), or the near ultraviolet range (150 nm to 380 nm). Suitable lasers include, but are not<br>
limited to, solid state pulsed lasers, pulsed metal vapor lasers, excimer lasers and<br>
continuous wave lasers with pulse modification, such as the commercially available<br>
Nd:YAG laser (wavelength 1064 nm), frequency-doubled Nd:YAG laser (wavelength 532<br>
nm), excimer laser (wavelength 193 nm-351 nm), and C02 laser (10.6 urn).<br>
In this invention, the plastic articles suitable for laser marking include any plastic<br>
articles that are molded, extruded or formed by any known conventional method. The<br>
plastic articles comprise resins and laser energy absorbing additives, as described<br>
below, and may further comprise other additives provided the additives do not interfere<br>
with the laser marking of the articles. Such other additives are known to those skilled in<br><br>
the art of polymer compounding and include, but are not limited to, reinforcing fillers,<br>
flame retardants, antioxidants, dispersants, impact modifiers, ultraviolet stabilizers,<br>
plasticizers, and the like. The laser energy absorbing additives of this invention may also<br>
be incorporated into plastic coatings, including coatings or inks formed from aqueous or<br>
non-aqueous solutions or dispersions of polymeric materials or powdery polymeric<br>
coatings. Such coatings or inks can be applied onto the surface of any article such as<br>
those formed of plastic, metal, glass, ceramic, wood, etc. Thus, the plastic coatings<br>
containing the laser marking additives of this invention allow the use of lasers to mark<br>
any type of substrate.<br>
In this invention, the laser energy absorbing additive is capable of absorbing light<br>
preferably in the near infrared range, the visible range, and/or the near ultraviolet range.<br>
Exemplary additives include, but are not limited to, carbon black, graphite, zirconium<br>
silicates, calcium silicates, zeolite, cordierite, mica, kaolin, talc, silica, aluminum silicates,<br>
metal salts such as copper phosphates, and the like. Any commercially available organic<br>
pigment or inorganic pigment is suitable for use as a colorant. Exemplary organic<br>
pigments include, but are not limited to, Barium red 1050Â® (Cook Son), Filamid yellow<br>
RÂ®, Filamid red GAÂ®, Heliogen green K8730Â®, Heliogen blue K6911DÂ®, LISA red 57YÂ®<br>
LISA red 61R (Bayer), 1290 Rightfitâ„¢ Yellow, 2920 Rightfitâ„¢ Brilliant Orange, 1112<br>
Rightfitâ„¢ Scarlet (Engelhard), and the like.<br>
The laser marking additives such as those listed above and hereinafter described<br>
have a size less than 100 nm. Various and known methods are available for forming the<br>
laser marking additives into nano-sized particles, as will be more fully described below.<br>
Typically, the laser marking additive will comprise 0.01 to 5% by weight of the resin<br>
component which forms the plastic article or coating. Even at the higher loadings, the<br><br>
presence of the nano-sized additives of this invention may still only minimally change the<br>
color of the resin.<br>
In accordance with the present invention, a particularly useful additive is one that<br>
is adapted for use in conjunction with a YAG laser. A useful example is an additive of a<br>
powder of mixed oxides of tin and antimony. The powder is principally tin oxide and only<br>
a small amount of antimony oxide that is expressed as Sb2O3. The Sb2O3 level can be up<br>
to about 17% of the mixed oxide. Preferably, the amount of antimony oxide is about 1 to<br>
5% by weight of the mixed oxide. A particularly exemplary additive of a mixed oxide of tin<br>
and antimony will have a particle size of from about 10-70 nm, more preferably 20-50<br>
nm. A loading ofSb2O3 of 2% by weight in the mixed oxide has been found to be<br>
particularly useful.<br>
Techniques for producing nano-sized materials generally fall into one of three<br>
categories, namely, mechanical processing, chemical processing, or physical (thermal)<br>
processing. In mechanical processes, fine powders are commonly made from large<br>
particles using crushing techniques such as a high-speed ball mill. With chemical<br>
processes, nano materials are created from a reaction that precipitates particles of<br>
varying sizes and shapes using a family of materials known as organometallics<br>
(substances containing combinations of carbon and metals bonded together) or various<br>
metal salts. The chemical processes are often combined with thermal processing, e.g.<br>
pyrolysis.<br>
Chemical processing can take place in the gas or liquid phase. Gas phase<br>
syntheses include metal vapor condensation and oxidation, sputtering, laser-ablation,<br>
plasma-assisted chemical vapor deposition, and laser-induced chemical vapor<br>
deposition. Liquid phase processing encompasses precipitation techniques, and sol-gel<br><br>
processing. Aerosol techniques include spray drying, spray pyrolysis, and flame<br>
oxidation/hydrolysis of halides.<br>
Of the aerosol processing techniques available for production of ceramic powders,<br>
spray pyrolysis and flame oxidation of halides are the primary methods used to produce<br>
ultrafine powders. In both methods, submicron sized droplets of solutions of metal salts<br>
or alkoxides can be produced by standard aerosolization techniques. In spray pyrolysis,<br>
the resulting aerosol is thermolyzed, to pyrolytically convert the aerosol droplet to an<br>
individual ceramic particle of the same stoichiometry as the parent solution. Thermal<br>
events in the process include solvent evaporation, solute precipitation, thermal<br>
conversion of the precipitate to a ceramic, and sintering of the particle to full density.<br>
Spray pyrolysis is most commonly used for the preparation of metallic ceramic<br>
powders. The resultant powders typically have sizes in the 100-10,000 nm range. The<br>
particle sizes produced are controlled by the size of droplets within the aerosol and the<br>
weight percent dissolved solids in the solution. The final particle size decreases with<br>
smaller initial droplet sizes and lower concentrations of dissolved solids in solution.<br>
Aerosolization may be accomplished by several well known technologies. For<br>
example, a precursor solution may be atomized by flow through a restrictive nozzle at<br>
high pressure, or by flow into a high volume, low pressure gas stream. When such<br>
atomizers are used, the high volume gas stream should be air, air enriched with oxygen,<br>
or preferably substantially pure oxygen. When high pressure atomization through a<br>
restrictive orifice is used, the orifice is preferably surrounded by jets of one of the above<br>
gases, preferably oxygen. More than one atomizer for aerosolization may be positioned<br>
within the flame pyrolysis chamber. Other aerosol-producing methods, for example<br>
ultrasonic or piezoelectric droplet formation, may be used. However, some of these<br>
techniques may undesirably affect production rate. Ultrasonic generation is preferred, the<br><br>
aerosol generator generating ultrasound through reasonant action of the oxygen flow and<br>
the liquid in a chamber.<br>
The aerosol is ignited by suitable means, for example laser energy, glow wire,<br>
electrical discharge, but is preferably ignited by means of an oxyhydrogen or<br>
hydrocarbon gas/oxygen torch. Prior to initiating combustion, the flame pyrolysis<br>
chamber is preheated to the desired operating range of 500Â° C to 2000Â° C, preferably<br>
700Â° C to 1500Â° C, and most preferably 800Â° C to 1200Â° C. Preheating improves particle<br>
size distribution and minimizes water condensation in the system. Preheating may be<br>
accomplished through the use of the ignition torch alone, by feeding and combusting<br>
pure solvent, i.e. ethanol, through the atomizer, by resistance heating or containment in a<br>
muffle furnace, combinations of these methods, or other means.<br>
The following U.S. patents disclose non-limiting examples of how to form nano-<br>
sized particles and ail are herein incorporated by reference in their entirety: U.S. Patent<br>
Nos. 5,128,081; 5,486,675; 5,711,783; 5,876,386; 5,958,361; 6,132,653; 6,600,127.<br>
Other methods of forming nanoparticles are disclosed in U.S. patents assigned to<br>
Nanoproducts Corporation, Tucson, Arizona. U.S. Patent Nos. 5,788,738; 5,851,507;<br>
5,984,997; and 6,569,397 are herein incorporated by reference in their entirety.<br>
U.S. 5,788,738 discloses a thermal reactor system for producing nanoscale<br>
powders by ultra-rapid thermal quench processing of high-temperature vapors through a<br>
boundary-layer converging-diverging nozzle. A gas suspension of precursor material is<br>
continuously fed to a thermal reaction chamber and vaporized under conditions that<br>
minimize superheating and favor nucleation of the resulting vapor. The high temperature<br>
vapor is quenched using the principle of Joule-Thompson adiabatic expansion.<br>
Immediately after the initial nucleation stages, the vapor stream is passed through the<br>
nozzle and rapidly quenched through expansion at rates of at least 1,000Â° C per second,<br><br>
preferably greater than 1,000,000Â° C per second, to block the continued growth of the<br>
nucleated particles and produce a nanosize powder suspension of narrow particle-size<br>
distribution.<br>
U.S. 5,851,507 discloses a continuous process that produces nanoscale powders<br>
from different types of precursor material by evaporating the material and quenching the<br>
vaporized phase in a converging-diverging expansion nozzle. The precursor material<br>
suspended in a carrier gas is continuously vaporized in a thermal reaction chamber<br>
under conditions that favor nucleation of the resulting vapor. Immediately after the initial<br>
nucleation stages, the vapor stream is rapidly and uniformly quenched at rates of at least<br>
1,000 K/sec, preferably above 1,000,000 K/sec, to block the continued growth of the<br>
nucleated particles and produce a nanosize powder suspension of narrow particle-size<br>
distribution. The nanopowder is then harvested by filtration from the quenched vapor<br>
stream and the carrier medium is purified, compressed and recycled for mixing with new<br>
precursor material in the feed stream.<br>
U.S. 5,984,997 and U.S. 6,569,397 disclose a process for producing nanoscale<br>
powders by mixing an emulsion comprising all of the elements of the desired powder<br>
composition and a combustible fuel, and then combusting that emulsion to produce a<br>
powder. Powders with a median particle size of less than 50 nm have been made by this<br>
process. The process is suitable for the production of many types of powders, including<br>
particles and nanowhiskers of simple, doped, and polymetaliic powders.<br>
The particular method of forming the laser marking additive into nano-sized<br>
particles is not believed to be vital to practicing this invention. Any method may be used<br>
that will yield particles of less than about 100 nm.<br>
The nano-sized Sb2O3-doped Sn02 as previously described is highly efficient as a<br>
YAG laser marking additive. That efficiency allows only a small quantity of the powder to<br><br>
be added to the material to be marked and achieve the desired marking attributes. In<br>
general, the marking additive loading is about 0.01-5% of the total weight of the article to<br>
be marked, and preferably about 0.01-0.1%. Additive levels of at least 0.025 wt % are<br>
particularly useful. TheSb2O3-doped Sn02 laser marking additive can be incorporated<br>
into any plastic material which is transparent to YAG laser irradiation by any convenient<br>
method.<br>
Dispersing the nano-sized marking additives within the plastic may be<br>
problematic. The small particle size of the marking additive may result in agglomeration<br>
of the additive and a less than uniform dispersion or mixing of the additive within the<br>
plastic composition and ultimate object that is formed. Accordingly, surface treatment of<br>
the laser-marking additives to reduce agglomeration may be useful. Such surface<br>
treatments are known in the art and include, for example, silanes, fatty acids, low<br>
molecular weight polymeric waxes, titanates, etc. Functionalized silanes may be<br>
particularly useful as the functionality can also render the additive compatible with the<br>
plastic to enhance uniform mixing within the plastic an avoidance of additive segregation.<br>
Typically the additive in powder form, whether treated or untreated, is mixed with the<br>
plastic prior to molding or applied as a coating. The plastic for molding can be in the<br>
form of chips, powders, or pellets. The solid mixture is then melted and mixed such as in<br>
an injection molding process, blow molding, or extrusion molding and the like.<br>
Alternatively, the laser marking additive may be thoroughly mixed with the melted resin<br>
and molded into chips, powders, or pellets which are again melted just prior to molding.<br>
It has further been found that the addition of a metal or semimetal powder in<br>
concentrations of from, for example, 0.5 to 10% by weight, preferably from 0.5 to 7% by<br>
weight, and in particular from 0.5 to 5% by weight, based on the laser marking additive,<br>
improves the contrast achieved in the laser marking of thermoplastics.<br><br>
The invention accordingly further provides a laser-markable plastic, characterized<br>
in that the plastic comprises a dopant of at least one metal powder or semimetal powder,<br>
preferably selected from the group consisting of aluminum, boron, titanium, magnesium,<br>
copper, tin, silicon and zinc. Besides boron and silicon, other possible semi-metals are<br>
Sb, As, Bi, Ge, Po, Se and Te. The dopant preferably has a particle size of less than<br>
500 nm, more preferably less than 200 nm.<br>
The concentration of the dopant in the plastic is dependent, however, on the<br>
plastics system used. A too small fraction of dopant does not significantly alter the<br>
plastics system and does not influence its processability. Of the metal or semimetal<br>
powders mentioned, silicon powder is preferred. Besides the metal or semimetal powder,<br>
mixtures may also be used as dopant. The mixing ratio of metal to semi-metal is<br>
preferably from 1:10 to 10:1, but the metal and/or semimetal powders may be mixed with<br>
one another in any ratio. Preferred metal powder mixtures are: silicon/boron,<br>
silicon/aluminium, boron/aluminium and silicon/zinc.<br>
In certain compositions of the dopant, the addition also of small amounts of a<br>
metal halide, preferably calcium chloride, is advantageous for the contrast of the laser<br>
marking of the plastic.<br>
The incorporation of the nano-sized laser marking additve and of the metal and/or<br>
semimetal dopant powder into the plastic takes place by mixing the plastic granules with<br>
the additives and then shaping the mixture under the action of heat. The addition of the<br>
metal and/or semimetal powder and, respectively, of the powder mixture and the marking<br>
additive to the plastic may take place simultaneously or successively. During the<br>
incorporation of the dopant, any tackifiers, organic, polymer-compatible solvents,<br>
stabilizers and/or surfactants that are thermally stable under the operating conditions<br>
may be added to the plastic granules. The doped plastic granules are generally prepared<br><br>
by introducing the plastic granules into an appropriate mixer, wetting them with any<br>
additives, and then adding the marking additive and dopant and mixing them in. The<br>
plastic is generally pigmented by way of a color concentrate (masterbatch) or<br>
compounded formulation. The mixture obtained in this way may then be processed<br>
directly in an extruder or an injection molding machine. The molds formed in the course<br>
of processing exhibit a very homogeneous distribution of the dopant. Subsequently, laser<br>
marking takes place with an appropriate laser. For applied coatings, the additives can<br>
simply be mixed with the carrier for the polymer coating material or added as a solid to<br>
powder coating compositions.<br>
The material to be marked can be an organic object such as a plastic or polymeric<br>
article. Suitable resins include, but are not limited to, any naturally occurring or synthetic<br>
polymer prepared by polymerization, polycondensation or polyaddition, such as<br>
polyethylene, polypropylene, polyisobutylene, polystyrene, polyvinyl chloride,<br>
polyvinylidene chloride, polyvinyl acetals, polyacrylonitrile, polyacrylates,<br>
polymethacrylates, polybutadiene, ABS, ethylene vinyl acetate, polyamides, polyimides,<br>
polyoxymethylene, polysulfones, polyphenylene sulfide, polycarbonates, polyurethanes,<br>
polyethers, polyether sulfones, polyacetals, phenolics, polycarbonate, polyester<br>
carbonate, polyethylene terephthalate, polybutylene terephthalate, polyarylates,<br>
polyether ketones, and mixtures and copolymers thereof. The above polymers can also<br>
be formulated into coating compositions as is well known in the art and applied by known<br>
coating techniques to any type of substrate.<br>
The nano-sized laser marking additives of this invention can be incorporated into<br>
a resin formulated into any size or configuration. No limits regarding the shape of the<br>
article to be marked can be contemplated. Three-dimensional plastic parts, containers,<br>
packages, etc., regardless of how formed such as by injection molding, extrusion, blow<br><br>
molding, and the like can include the nano-sized additives of this invention and marked<br>
by a laser by techniques known in the art.<br>
Besides three-dimensional parts, containers, packages, and the like, the nano-<br>
sized additives, for example, can be incorporated into plastic sheeting or film to produce<br>
transparent (or color-free) plastic sheeting that can be laser marked with a dark mark.<br>
Potential applications include packaging, labeling, and laminated plastic sheets. The<br>
nano-sized additives can be incorporated into co-extruded multilayered films such as<br>
iridescent film to produce special effect film that can be laser marked. One marking<br>
option is to produce a dark mark similar to above, and the other option is to use low<br>
power laser to heat the film to melting, rather than charring, to produce a mark with<br>
different optical properties from the original iridescent film. Potential applications include<br>
packaging, labeling, and laminated plastic sheets. The nano-sized additives can be<br>
incorporated into plastic that is blown to make transparent (or color-free) plastic bags that<br>
can be laser marked with a dark mark. Potential application is the ability to mark a<br>
plastic bag for any purpose including labeling with information on the contents of the bag.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
A charge of 0.05 wt % of a powder of Sb203-doped Sn02 mixed oxide was mixed<br>
with pellets of PETG (polyethylene terephthlate glycol). The mixed oxide powder had a<br>
loading of 2 wt % Sb203 and had a size ranging from 20-50 nm. The mixture of nano-<br>
sized additive and PETG pellets was injection molded into step chips. A YAG laser beam<br>
was imposed on the resulting step chip using a current of 13-16 amps, a pulse frequency<br>
of 1-9 kHz, a scan velocity of 300 mm/sec. and an aperture of 0.0635 in. It was found<br>
that distinct lines having a width of about 0.1 mm could be achieved. This was a result of<br>
the laser marking additive absorbing the YAG laser energy and converting it to heat so<br><br>
as to carbonize the surrounding polymeric material, thereby making a black or dark mark<br>
which was in contrast to the surrounding area. Using a stereomicroscope, the marks<br>
were seen to be due to heavy foaming and charring of the polymer, as expected<br>
PETG is a crystal clear polymer. At the loading of 0.05 wt %, the polymer<br>
acquired a slight blue hue, but retained original clarity. 2-3 micron Sb2C&gt;3-doped Sn02<br>
results in a hazy, colored polymer when used at the same loading.<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
Antimony doped tin oxide nanoparticles as in Example 1 and having a size of 50<br>
nm are incorporated into low-density polyethylene plastic sheeting to produce<br>

effect film is laser marked with a YAG laser to produce a dark mark.<br>
EXAMPLE 4<br>
