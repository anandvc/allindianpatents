DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION . <br>
In the recitations herein, the term "carbon moiety" refers to a radical in which a carbon atom is connected to the backbone of the 4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrazole ring. As the carbon moieties L and R (including R4) are substituents separated from the reaction center, they can encompass a great variety of carbon-based groups preparable by modern methods of synthetic organic chemistry. The method of this invention is generally applicable to a wide range of starting compounds of Formula I and product compounds of Formula II One skilled in the art will recognize that certain groups are sensitive to hydrogen halides and may be transformed under the reaction conditions. One skilled in the art will also recognize that certain groups are basic and can form salts with hydrogen halides, and thus the method of this invention can require additional hydrogen halide.<br>
"Carbon moiety" thus includes alkyl, alkenyl and alkynyl, which can be straight-chain or branched.   "Carbon moiety" also includes carbocyclic and heterocyclic rings, which can be saturated, partially saturated, or completely unsaturated.  Furthermore, unsaturated rings can be aromatic if Huckel's rule is satisfied.  The carbocyclic and heterocyclic rings of a carbon moiety can form polycyclic ring systems comprising multiple rings connected together.   The term "carbocyclic ring" denotes- a ring wherein the atoms forming the ring backbone are selected only from carbon.   The term "heterocyclic ring" denotes a ring wherein at least one of the ring backbone atoms is other than carbon.     "Saturated carbocyclic" refers to a ring having a backbone consisting of carbon atoms linked to one another by single bonds; unless otherwise specified, the remaining carbon valences are occupied by hydrogen atoms.  The term "aromatic ring system" -denotes fully unsaturated carbocycles and heterocycles in which at least one ring in a polycyclic ring system is aromatic. Aromatic indicates that each of ring atoms is essentially in the same plane and has<br>
a p-orbital perpendicular to the ring plane, and in which (4n + 2) % electrons, when n is 0 or a positive integer, are associated with the ring to comply with Huckel's rule. The term "aromatic carbocyclic ring system" includes fully aromatic carbocycles and carbocycles in which at least one ring of a polycyclic ring system is aromatic. The term "nonaromatic carbocyclic ring system" denotes fully saturated carbocycles as well as partially or fully unsaturated carbocycles wherein none of the rings in the ring system are aromatic. The terms "aromatic heterocyclic ring system" and "heteroaromatic ring" include fully aromatic heterocycles and heterocycles in which at least one ring of a polycyclic ring system is aromatic. The term "nonaromatic heterocyclic ring system" denotes fully saturated heterocycles as well as partially or fully unsaturated heterocycles wherein none of the rings in the ring system are aromatic. The term "aryl" denotes a carbocyclic or heterocyclic ring or ring system in which at least one ring is aromatic, and the aromatic ring provides the connection to the remainder of the molecule.<br>
The carbon moieties specified for L, R and R4 are optionally substituted.  The term "optionally substituted" in connection with these carbon moieties refers to carbon moieties that are unsubstituted or have at least one non-hydrogen substituent.   Illustrative optional substituents include alkyl, alkenyl, cycloalkyl, cycloalkenyl, aryL hydroxycarbonyl, formyl, alkylcarbonyl,    alkenylcarbonyl,    alkynylcarbonyl,    alkoxycarbonyl,   hydroxy,    alkoxy, alkenyloxy,    alkynyloxy,   cycloalkoxy,   aryloxy,    alkylthio,  • alkenylthfo,   alkynylthio, cycloalkylthio, arylthio, alkylsulfinyl, alkenylsulfinyl, alkynylsulfinyl, cycloalkylsulfinyl, arylsulfinyl,      alkylsulfonyl,      alkenylsulfonyl,      alkynylsulfonyl,      cycloalkylsulfonyl, arylsulfonyl, amino, alkylamino, alkenylamino, allcynylamino, arylamino, aminocarbonyl, altylaminocarbonyl,   alkenylaminocarbonyl,   alkynylaminocarbonyl,   arylaminocarbonyl, alkylaminocarbonyl, alkenylaminocarbonyl, alkynylaminocarbonyl, arylaminocarbonyloxy, alkoxycarbonylamino, alkenyioxycarbonylamino, allcynyloxycarbonylamino and aryloxy-carbonylamino, each further optionally substituted; and halogen, cyano and nitro.   The optional further substituents are independently selected from groups like those illustrated above for the substituents themselves to give additional substituent groups for L, R and R4 such as haloalkyl, haloalkenyl and haloalkoxy.   As a further example, alkylamino can be further substituted with alkyl, giving dialkylamino.    The substituents can also be tied together by figuratively removing one or two hydrogen atoms from each of two substituents or a substituent and the supporting molecular structure and joining the radicals to produce cyclic and polycyclic structures fused or appended to the molecular structure supporting the substituents. For example, tying together adjacent hydroxy and methoxy groups attached to, for example, a phenyl ring gives a fused dioxolane structure containing the linking group -O-CH2-O-.   Tying together a hydroxy group and the molecular structure to which it is attached can give cyclic ethers, including epoxides.   Illustrative substituents also include oxygen, which when attached to carbon forms a carbonyl function.   Similarly, sulfur when<br>
attached to carbon forms a thiocarbonyl function. Within a carbon moiety L or R, tying together substituents can form cyclic and polycyclic structures. Also illustrative of carbon moieties L and R are embodiments wherein at least two R moieties, or the L moiety and at least one R moiety, are contained in the same radical (i.e., a ring system is formed). As the 4,5-dihydropyrazole moiety constitutes one ring, two vicinally positioned R moieties, or L and R moieties, contained in the same radical would result in a fused bicyclic or polycyclic ring system. Two geminally positioned R moieties contained in the same radical would result in a spiro ring system.<br>

do not need to be present since they are optional substituents.   The nitrogen atoms that<br>
require substitution to fill their valence are substituted with H or Rv.   Note that some U<br>
groups can only be substituted with less than 4 Rv groups (e.g. U-l4, U-l5, U-l8 through<br>
U-21 and U-32 through U-34 can only be substituted with one Rv).   Note that when the<br>
attachment point between (Rv)r and the U group is illustrated as floating, (Rv)r can be<br>
attached to any available carbon atom or nitrogen atom of the U group. Note that when the<br>
attachment point on the U group is illustrated as floating, the U group can be attached to the<br>

Scheme 1<br>
(Scheme Removed) <br>
wherein L, R, X1, X2 and k are as defined in the Summary of the Invention.<br>
The reaction is conducted in a suitable solvent. For best results the solvent should be non-nucleophilic, relatively inert to HX1 and capable of dissolving the compound of Formula n. Suitable solvents include dibromomethane, dichloromethane, acetic acid, ethyl acetate and acetonitrile.   The reaction can be conducted at or near atmospheric pressure or above atmospheric pressure in a pressure vessel.  The HX1 starting material can be added in the form of a gas to the reaction mixture containing the Formula II compound and solvent. When X2 in the compound of Formula II is a halogen such as CI, the reaction is preferably conducted in a way such that the HX2 generated by the reaction is removed by sparging or other suitable means.   Alternatively, the HX1 starting material can be first dissolved in an inert solvent in which it is highly soluble (such as acetic acid) before contacting with the compound of Formula II either neat or in solution.   Also when X2 in the compound of Formula II is a halogen such as CI, substantially more than one equivalent of HX1 (e.g., 4 to 10 equivalents) is typically needed -depending upon the level of conversion desired.   One equivalent of HX1 can provide high conversion when X2 is OS(O)R.1 or OP(O)p(OR2)2, but when the compound of Formula II comprises at least one basic function (e.g., a nitrogen-containing heterocycle), more than one equivalent is HX1 is typically needed. The reaction can be conducted between about 0 and 100 °C, most conveniently near ambient temperature (e.g., about 10-40 °C), and most preferably between about 20 and 30 °C.   Addition of a Lewis acid catalyst (e.g., aluminum bromide for preparing Formula I wherein X1 is Br) can facilitate the reaction. The product of Formula I is isolated by the usual methods known to those skilled in the art, including extraction, distillation and crystallization.<br>
For the method of this invention, preferred starting compounds include compounds of Formula II wherein m is 2 and p is 1. Also preferred are starting compounds of Formula II wherein X2 is halogen or OS(O)R1 (especially where m is 2). Further preferred are starting compounds of Formula II wherein X2 is CI or OS(O)R1, m is 2, and R1 is C1-C6 alkyl, CF3 or phenyl optionally substituted with from 1 to 3 substituents selected from C1-C4 alkyl, and more preferably R1 is C1-C2 alkyl, phenyl or 4-methylphenyl. Particularly preferred methods of this invention include those using a starting compound of Formula II wherein X2 is CI or 0S(O)2R1, and R1 is methyl, phenyl or 4-methylphenyl. Especially preferred method of this invention include those using a starting compound of Formula II wherein X2 is CI or OS(O)2R1, and R1 is phenyl or 4-methylphenyl.<br>
For the method of this invention, preferred product compounds include compounds of Formula I wherein X1 is CI, Br or I. More preferred product compounds include compounds of Formula I wherein X1 is CI or Br. Most preferred product compounds include compounds of Formula I wherein X1 is Br. Particularly useful embodiments of the method of this invention include the preparation of a compound of Formula I wherein X1 is CI or Br from a compound of Formula II wherein X2 is OS(O)2R1, wherein R1 is, for example, methyl, phenyl or 4-methylphenyl, more preferably phenyl or 4-methylphenyl.<br>

One skilled in the art will recognize that Formula la is a subgenus of Formula I, and Formula Ha is subgenus of Formula II.<br>
While a wide range of optionally substituted carbon moieties as already described are useful as R4 in esters of Formula la for the method of Scheme 2, commonly R4 is a radical containing up to 18 carbon atoms and selected from alkyl, alkenyl and alkynyl; and benzyl and phenyl, each optionally substituted with alkyl and halogen. Most preferably R4 is C2-C4 alkyl.<br>
Of note is the method shown in Scheme 2 wherein Z is N, n is 1 and R3 is CI or Br and is located at the 3-position. Also of note is the method shown in Scheme 2 wherein X2 is halogen or OS(O)2R1, particularly where R1 is methyl, phenyl or 4-methylphenyl. Also of note is the method shown in Scheme 2 wherein X1 is Br or CI and more particularly X1 is Br. Of particular note is the method shown in Scheme 2 wherein X1 is Br, X2 is CI or OS(O)R1, m is 2, and R1 is phenyl or 4-methylphenyl.<br>
When a basic functionality is present in the compound of Formula IIa (e.g., Z is N and/or R3 is alkylamino, diallcylarnino, cycloalkylamino or (alkyl)(cycloa!kyl)amino) typically more than one equivalent of HX1 is needed for satisfactory conversion even when X2 is OS(O)R1 or 0P(O)p(0R2)2. When Z is N, R3 is other than alkylamino, dialkylamino, cycloalkylamino and (alkyl)(cycloalkyl)amino), and X2 is S(O)2R1 in Formula IIa, excellent conversion is obtained using as little as 1.5 to 2 equivalents of HX1.<br>
Starting compounds of Formula II wherein X2 is halogen can be prepared from corresponding compounds of Formula 1 as shown in Scheme 3<br>
Scheme 3<br>
(Scheme Removed) <br>
wherein X2 is halogen and L, R and k are as previousy defined.<br>
Treatment of a compound of Formula 1 with a halogenating reagent, usually in the presence of a solvent, affords the corresponding halo compound of Formula II. Halogenating reagents that can be used include phosphorus oxyhalides, phosphorus trihalides, phosphorus pentahalides, thionyl chloride, dihalotrialkylphosphoranes, dihalodiphenylphosphoranes, oxalyl chloride, phosgene, sulfur tetrafluoride and (diemylamino)sulfur trifluoride. Preferred '<br>
are phosphorus oxyhalides and phosphorus pentahalides. To obtain complete conversion, at least 0.33 equivalents of phosphorus oxyhalide versus the compound of Formula 1 (i.e. the mole ratio of phosphorus oxyhalide to Formula 1 is at least 0.33) should be used, preferably between about 0.33  and  1.2 equivalents.     To obtain complete conversion,  at least 0.20 equivalents of phosphorus pentahalide versus the compound of Formula 1 should be used, preferably between about 0.20 and 1.0 equivalents.    Typical solvents for this halogenation   include   halogenated   alkanes,    such   as   dichloromethane,    chloroform, chlorobutane and the like, aromatic solvents, such as benzene, xylene, chlorobenzene and the like, ethers, such as tetrahydrofuran, p-dioxane, diethyl ether, and the like, and polar aprotic solvents such as acetonitrile, N,N-dimethylformamide, and the like.  Optionally, an organic base, such as triemylamine, pyridine, N,N-dimethylaniline or the like, can be added. Addition of a catalyst, such as N,N-dimethylformamide, is also an option. Preferred is the process in which the solvent is acetonitrile and a base is-absent Typically, neither a base nor a catalyst is required when acetonitrile solvent is used.  The preferred process is conducted by mixing the compound of Formula 1 in acetonitrile.   The halogenating reagent is then added over a convenient time, and the mixture is then held at the desired temperature until the reaction is complete. The reaction temperature is typically between about 20 °C and the boiling point of acetonitrile, and the reaction time is typically less than 2 hours. The reaction mass is then neutralized with an inorganic base, such as sodium bicarbonate, sodium hydroxide and the like, or an organic base, such as sodium acetate. The desired product, a compound of Formula II, can be isolated by methods known to those skilled in the art, including extraction, crystallization and distillation.<br>
As shown in Scheme 4, starting compounds of Formula II wherein R1 is a OS(O)R1 or OP(O)p(OR2)2 can likewise be prepared from corresponding compounds of Formula 1 by contacting with X3S(O)mR1 (2) or X3P(O)p(OR2)2 (3), respectively, wherein X3 is a nucleophilic reaction leaving group. Halides such as CI are particularly useful for X3. Also useful for X3S(O)mRl is X3 being OS(O)R1 (i.e. Formula 2 is RlS(O)m-S(O)R1); X3 being OS(O)R1 is particularly useful when R1 is CF3. In view of synthetic accessibility and relatively low cost, X3 being CI is generally preferred.<br>

In this method, the compound of Formula 1 is contacted with a compound of Formula 2 (for<br>
X2 being OS(O)R1) or Formula 3 (for X2 being OP(O)p(OR2)2), typically in the presence<br>
of a solvent and a base.    Suitable solvents include dichloromethane, tetrahydrofuran,<br>
acetonitrile and the like.    Suitable bases include tertiary amines (e.g., triethylamine,<br>
N,N-diiopropylethylamine) and ionic bases such as potassium carbonate and the like.   A<br>
tertiary amine is preferred as the base. At least one of equivalent (preferably a small excess,<br>
e.g., 5-10%) of the compound of Formula 2 or Formula 3 and the base relative to the<br>
compound Formula 1 is generally used to give complete conversion.   The reaction is<br>
typically conducted at a temperature between about -50 °C and the boiling point of the<br>
solvent, more commonly between about 0 °C and ambient temperature (i.e. about 15 to<br>
30 °C).   The reaction is typically complete within a couple hours to several days; the<br>
progress of the reaction can by monitored by such techniques known to those skilled in the<br>
art as thin layer chromatography and analysis of the lH NMR spectrum.    The reaction<br>
mixture is then worked up, such as by washing with water, drying the organic phase and<br>
evaporating the solvent The desired product, a compound of Formula II, can be isolated by<br>
methods known to those ^skilled in the art, including extraction, crystallization and<br>
distillation.<br>

In this method, a hydrazine compound of Formula 4 is contacted with a compound of Formula 5 (a fumarate ester or maleate ester or a mixture thereof may be used) in the presence of a base and a solvent. The base is typically a metal alkoxide salt, such as sodium methoxide,  potassium  methoxide,   sodium   ethoxide,   potassium  ethoxide,  potassium tert-butoxide, lithium tert-butoxide, and the like. Greater than 0.5 equivalents of base versus the compound of Formula 4 should be used, preferably between 0.9 and 1.3 equivalents.       Greater than 1.0 equivalents of the compound of Formula 5 should be used, preferably between 1.0 to 1.3 equivalents. Polar protic and polar aprotic organic solvents can be used, such as alcohols, acetonitrile, tetrahydrofuran, N,N-dimethylformamide, dimethyl sulfoxide and the like. Preferred solvents are alcohols such as methanol and emanol. It is especially preferred that the alcohol be the same as that making up" the fumarate or maleate ester and the alkoxide base. The reaction is typically conducted by mixing the compound of Formula 4 and the base in the solvent. The mixture can be heated or cooled to a desired temperature and the compound of Formula 5 added over a period of time.    Typically reaction temperatures are between 0 °C and the boiling point of the solvent used. The reaction may be conducted under greater than atmospheric pressure in order to increase the boiling point of the solvent.   Temperatures between about 30 and 90 °C are generally preferred.   The addition time can be as quick as heat transfer allows.  Typical addition times are between 1 minute and 2 hours.   Optimum reaction temperature and addition time vary depending upon the identities of the compounds of Formula 4 and Formula 5.   After addition, the reaction mixture can be held for a time at the reaction temperature.   Depending upon the reaction temperature, the required hold time may be from 0 to 2 hours. Typical hold times are 10 to 60 minutes.  The reaction mass then can be acidified by adding an organic acid, such as acetic acid and the like, or an inorganic acid, such as hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid and the like. Depending on the reaction conditions and the means of isolation, the -CO2R4 function on the compound of Formula la may be hydtolyzed to -CO2H; for example, the presence of water in the reaction mixture can promote such hydrolysis.   If the carboxylic acid (-CO2H) is formed, it can be converted back to -CON2R4 wherein R4 is, for example, C1-C4 alkyl using esterification methods well-known in the art.   The desired product, a<br>
compound of Formula la, can be isolated by methods known to those skilled in the art, such as crystallization, extraction or distillation.<br>

carboxylate	<br>
A 2-L four-necked flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer, thermometer, addition funnel, reflux condenser, and nitrogen inlet was charged with absolute ethanol (250 mL) and an ethanolic solution of sodium ethoxide (21%, 190 mL, 0.504 mol). The mixture was heated to reflux at about 83 °C. It was then treated with 3-chloro-2(lH)-pyridinone hydrazone (68.0 g, 0.474 mol). The mixture was re-heated to reflux over a period of 5 minutes. The yellow slurry was then treated dropwise with diethyl maleate (88.0 mL, 0.544 mol) over a period of 5 minutes. The reflux rate increased markedly during the addition. By the end of the addition all of the starting material had dissolved. The resulting orange-red solution was held at reflux for 10 minutes. After being cooled to 65 °C, the reaction mixture was treated with glacial acetic acid (50.0 mL, 0.873 mol). A precipitate formed. The mixture was diluted with water (650 mL), causing the precipitate to dissolve. The orange solution was cooled in an ice bath. Product began to precipitate at 28 °C. The slurry was held at about 2 °C for 2 hours. The product was isolated via filtration, washed with, aqueous ethanol (40%, 3 x 50 mL), and then air-dried on the filter for about 1 hour. The title product compound was obtained as a highly crystalline, light orange powder (70.3 g, 55% yield).

To a 2-L four-necked flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer, thermometer, reflux condenser, and nitrogen inlet was  charged acetonitrile (1000 mL),  ethyl 2-(3-chloro-      2-pyridinyl)-5-oxo-3-pyrazolidinecarboxylate (i.e. the product of Step A) (91.0 g, 0.337 mol) and  phosphorus  oxychloride  (35.0 mL,   0.375 mol).     Upon   adding  the   phosphorus oxychloride, the mixture se]f-heated jfroxn 22 to 25 °C and a precipitate formed.   The Bght-yellow slurry was heated to reflux at 83 °C over a period of 35 minutes, whereupon the precipitate dissolved.   The resulting orange solution was held at reflux for 45 minutes,       whereupon it had become black-green. The reflux condenser was replaced with a distillation head, and 650 mL of solvent was removed by distillation. A second 2-L four-necked flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer was charged with sodium bicarbonate (130 g, 1.55 mol) and water (400 mL).    The concentrated reaction mixture was added to the sodium bicarbonate slurry over a period of 15 minutes. The resulting, two-phase mixture was stirred vigorously for 20 minutes, at which time gas evolution had ceased. The mixture was diluted with dichloromethane (250 mL) and then was stirred for 50 rninutes.    The mixture was treated with Celite® 545 diatomaceous earth filter aid (11 g) and then filtered to remove a black, tarry substance that inhibited phase separation. Since the filtrate was slow to separate into distinct phases, it was diluted with dichloromethane (200 mL) and water (200 mL) and treated with more Celite® 545 (15 g).    The mixture was filtered, and the filtrate was transferred to a separatory funnel. The heavier, deep green organic layer was separated. A rag layer (50 mL) was refilt^red and then added to the organic layer. The organic solution (800 mL) was treated with magnesium sulfate (30 g) and silica gel (12 g), and the slurry was stirred magnetically for 30 minutes.   The slurry was filtered to remove the magnesium' sulfate and silica gel, which had become deep blue-green. The filter cake was washed with dichloromethane (100 mL).   The filtrate was concentrated on a rotary evaporator.   The product consisted of dark amber oil (92.0 g, 93% yield).  The only appreciable impurities observed by 1H NMR were 1% starting material and 0.7% acetonitrile. 1H NMR (DMSO-d6) δ 1.15 (t, 3H), 3.26 (dd, 1H), 3.58 (dd, 1H), 4.11 (q, 2H), 5.25 (dd, 1H), 7.00 (dd, 1H), 7.84 (d, 1H), 8.12 (d, 1H).<br>

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
A need exists for additional methods to prepare 3-halo-4,5-dihydro-lH-pyrazoles. Such compounds include useful intermediates for the preparation of crop protection agents, pharmaceuticals and other fine chemicals.<br>
Several methods have been reported for the preparation of 3-halo-4,5-dihydro-lH-pyrazoles. For example, J. P. Chupp, J. Heterocyclic Chem. 1994, 31,. 1377-1380 reports the preparation of a 3-chloro-4,5-dihydro-lH'-pyrazole by contacting the corresponding oxo-pyrazolidine with phosphorus oxychloride. M. V. Gorelik et al., Journal of Organic Chemistry U.S.S.R. 1985, 21, 773-781 (English language translation of Zhurnal Organiclieskoi Kliimii 1985, 21(4), 851-859) discloses the preparation of 3-chloro-4,5-dihydro-liif-pyrazoles  by way of diazonium salt intermediates prepared from the corresponding 3-arnino-4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrazoles. K. K. Bach et al., Tetrahedron 1994, 50(25), 7543-7556 discloses the preparation of a 3-chloro-4,5-dihydro-lH-pyrazole by dipolar cycloaddition of an acrylate ester with a hydrazidoyl chloride intermediate formed by» decarboxylative chlorination of a hydrazone of glyoxylic acid.using N-chlorosucciriimide. The need remains for alternative methods, particularly those of broad chemical structure generality and which use relatively low cost reagents commercially available in industrial quantities.<br>

pplication 60/400352, filed July 31,2002 [BA9308 US PRVJ, and U.S. Patent Application 60/446438, filed February 11, 2003 [BA9308 US PRV1] and hereby incorporated herein in their entirety by reference; as well as in U.S. Patent Application 60/369,660, filed April 2, 2002.<br>
Compounds of Formula III can be prepared from corresponding compounds of Formula la by the processes outlined in Schemes 6-9.<br>
As illustrated in Scheme 6, a compound of Formula la is treated with an oxidizing agent optionally in the presence of acid.<br>
Scheme 6<br>
(Scheme Removed) <br>
wherein R3, R4, Z, X1 and n are as previously defined for Formula la.<br>
A compound of Formula la wherein R4 is C1-C4 alkyl is preferred as starting material for this step.   The oxidizing agent can be hydrogen peroxide, organic peroxides, potassium persulfate,  sodium persulfate,  ammonium persulfate,  potassium monopersulfate (e.g., Oxone®) or potassium permanganate.    To obtain complete conversion, at least one equivalent of oxidizing agent versus the compound of Formula la should be used, preferably from about one to two equivalents. This oxidation is typically carried out in the presence of a solvent.  The solvent can be an ether, such as tetrahydrofuran, p-dioxane and the like, an organic ester, such as ethyl acetate, dimethyl carbonate and the like, or a polar aprotic organic such as N,N-dimemylformamide, acetonitrile and the like. Acids suitable for use in the oxidation step include inorganic acids, such as sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid and the like, and organic acids, such as acetic acid, benzoic acid and the like.   The acid, when used, should be used in greater than 0.1 equivalents versus the compound of Formula la.   To obtain complete conversion, one to five equivalents of acid can be used. For the compounds of Formula la wherein Z is CR5, the preferred oxidant is hydrogen peroxide and the oxidation is preferably carried out in the absence of acid. For the compounds of Formula la wherein Z is N, the preferred oxidant is potassium persulfate and the oxidation is preferably carried out in the presence of sulfuric acid.   The reaction can be carried out by mixing the compound of Formula la in the desired solvent and, if used, the acid. The oxidant can then be added at a convenient rate. The reaction temperature is typically varied from as low as about 0 °C up to the boiling point of the solvent in order to obtain a reasonable reaction time to complete the reaction, preferably less than 8 hours. The desired product, a compound of<br>
Formula 6 can be isolated by methods known to those skilled in the art, including extraction, chromatography, crystallization and distillation.<br>
Carboxylic acid compounds of Formula 6 wherein R4 is H can be prepared by hydrolysis from corresponding ester compounds of Formula 6 wherein, for example, R4 is C1-C4 alkyl. Carboxylic ester compounds can be converted to carboxylic acid compounds by numerous methods including nucleophilic cleavage under anhydrous conditions or hydrolytic methods involving the use of either acids or bases (see T. W. Greene and P. G. M. Wuts, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, 2nd ed., John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., New York, 1991, pp. 224-269 for a review of methods). For compounds of Formula 6, base-catalyzed hydrolytic methods are preferred. Suitable bases include alkali metal (such as lithium, sodium or potassium) hydroxides. For example, the ester can be dissolved in a mixture of water and an alcohol such as ethanol. Upon treatment with sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide, the ester is saponified to provide the sodium or potassium salt of the carboxylic acid. Acidification with a strong acid, such as hydrochloric acid or sulfuric acid, yields the carboxylic acid of Formula 6 wherein R4 is H. The carboxylic acid can be isolated by methods known to those skilled in the art, including extraction, distillation and crystallization.<br>
Coupling of a pyrazolecarboxylic acid of Formula 6 wherein R4 is H with an anthranilic acid of Formula 7 provides the benzoxazinone of Formula 8. In Scheme 7, a benzoxazinone of Formula 8 is prepared directly via sequential addition of methanesulfonyl chloride in the presence of a tertiary amine such as triethylamine or pyridine to a pyrazolecarboxylic acid of Formula 6 wherein R4 is H, followed by the addition of an anthranilic  acid of Formula 7, followed by a second addition of tertiary amine and methanesulfonyl chloride.<br>
Scheme 7<br>
(Scheme Removed) <br>
wherein R3, R6, R7, X1, Z and n are as defined for Formula III. This procedure generally affords good yields of the benzoxazinone.<br>
Scheme 8 depicts an alternate preparation for benzoxazinones of Formula 8 involving coupling of apyrazole acid chloride of Formula 10 with an isatoic anhydride of Formula 9 to provide the Formula 8 benzoxazinone directly.<br>
Scheme 8<br>
(Scheme Removed) <br>
wherein R3, R6, R7, X1, Z and n are as defined for Formula III.<br>
Solvents such as pyridine or pyridine/acetonitrile are suitable for this reaction. The acid chlorides of Formula 10 are available from the corresponding acids of Formula 6 wherein R4 is H by known procedures such as chlorination with thionyl chloride or oxalyl chloride.<br>
Compounds of Formula IDE can be prepared by the reaction of benzoxazinones of Formula 8' with C1-C4 alkylamines and ((C1-C4 alkyl)(methyl)arnines of Formula 11 as outlined in Scheme 9.<br>
Scheme 9<br>
(Scheme Removed) <br>
wherein R3, R6, R7, R8a, R8b, X1, Z and n are as previously defined.<br>
The reaction can be run neat or in a variety of suitable solvents including acetonitrile, tetrahydrofuran, diethyl ether, dichloromethane or chloroform with optimum temperatures ranging from room temperature to the reflux temperature of the solvent. The general reaction of benzoxazinones with amines to produce anthranttamides is well documented in the chemical iiterature. For a review of benzoxazinone chemistry see Jakobsen et al., Biorganic and Medicinal Chemistry 2000, 8, 2095-2103 and references cited within. See also Coppola, J. Heterocyclic Chemistry 1999, 36, 563-588.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
