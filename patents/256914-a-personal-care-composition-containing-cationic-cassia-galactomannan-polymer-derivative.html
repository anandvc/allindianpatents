				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to personal care compositions containing a galactomannan polymer derivative having a mannose to galactose ratio of greater than 2 : 1. More specifically, it relates to personal care compositions containing a detersive surfactant and a cationic or amphoteric galactomannan polymer derivative having a mannose to galactose ratio of greater than 2 : 1 and having a cationic charge density of at least about 0.9 meq/g. In one aspect, the present invention relates to personal care compositions as described above which further comprise one or more conditioning agents.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Personal care compositions comprising various combinations of detersive surfactants and conditioning agents are known. These products typically comprise an anionic detersive surfactant in combination with a conditioning agent such as silicone, hydrocarbon oil, fatty esters, or combinations thereof. These products have become more popular among consumers as a means of conveniently obtaining hair or skin conditioning and cleansing performance all from a single personal care product.<br>
Many personal care compositions, though, do not provide sufficient deposition of conditioning agents onto hair and skin during the cleansing process. Without such deposition, large proportions of conditioning agent are rinsed away during the cleansing process, and, therefore, provide little or no conditioning benefit. Without sufficient deposition of the conditioning agent on the hair and skin, relatively high levels of conditioning agents may be needed in the personal care composition to provide adequate conditioning performance. However, high levels of a conditioning agent can increase raw material costs, reduce lathering, and present product stability concerns.<br>
Obtaining good deposition of a conditioning agent is further complicated by the action of detersive surfactants in the personal care composition. Detersive surfactants are designed to carry away or remove oil, grease, dirt, and particulate matter from the hair and skin. As a result, the detersive surfactants can interfere with deposition of the<br><br>
conditioning agent and can remove both deposited and non-deposited conditioning agent during rinsing. Consequently, after rinsing, the deposition of the conditioning agent onto the hair and skin is reduced, which, in turn, reduces conditioning performance. Therefore, to achieve desired conditioning performance with a given conditioning agent, a specific anionic surfactant system may be needed for use in combination with the given conditioning agent. However, requiring a specific surfactant system may lead to increased complications in formulation. As a result, it would be desirable to obtain good deposition of a conditioning agent in combination with a detersive surfactant without requiring a specific anionic surfactant system.<br>
One method for improving deposition of a conditioning agent involves the use of certain cationic deposition polymers. Commonly used cationic deposition polymers include natural polymers, such as guar gum polymers that have been modified with cationic substituents. Guar gum polymers are galactomarmans containing two mannose monomers with a glycoside linkage and one galactose monomer attached to a hydroxyl group of the mannose monomers (i.e., guar gum polymers have a mannose to galactose ratio of 2 : 1). Selecting a cationic guar deposition polymer with sufficient charge density and molecular weight, in combination with an optimized surfactant system, results in sufficient deposition of conditioning agents. However, to achieve this sufficient deposition of conditioning agents in shampoo or body wash compositions using a cationic guar polymer, a relatively high level of such cationic guar polymer generally must be deposited on the hair or skin. Moreover, the cost of such cationic guar polymer is relatively high. As a result, incorporation of cationic guar polymer can add to the manufacturing costs of such personal cleansing compositions.<br>
Accordingly, there is a continuing need for a personal cleansing composition which delivers superior conditioning benefits to hair and/or skin, without a reduced cleansing performance, through relatively low deposition of an inexpensive cationic or amphoteric polymer derivative in combination with a detersive surfactant without requiring a specific anionic surfactant system.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
While the specification concludes with claims which particularly point out and distinctly claim the invention, it is believed the present invention will be better understood from the following description.<br>
The personal care compositions of the present invention include detersive surfactant, a cationic galactomannan polymer, and an aqueous carrier. Each of these essential components, as well as preferred or optional components, is described in detail hereinafter.<br>
Herein, "comprising" means that other steps and other ingredients which do not affect the end result can be added. This term encompasses the terms "consisting of and "consisting essentially of. The compositions and methods/processes of the present invention can comprise, consist of, and consist essentially of the essential elements and limitations of the invention described herein, as well as any of the additional or optional ingredients, components, steps, or limitations described herein.<br>
All percentages, parts, and ratios are based upon the total weight of the compositions of the present invention, unless otherwise specified. All such weights as<br><br>
they pertain to listed ingredients are based on the active level and, therefore, do not include solvents or by-products that may be included in commercially available materials, unless otherwise specified. The term "weight percent" may be denoted as "wt.%" herein.<br>
All molecular weights as used herein are weight average molecular weights expressed as grams/mole, unless otherwise specified.<br>
The term "charge density", as used herein, refers to the ratio of the number of net positive charges on a monomeric unit of which a polymer is comprised to the molecular weight of said monomeric unit. The charge density multiplied by the polymer molecular weight determines the number of positively charged sites on a given polymer chain.<br>
The term "polymer" as used herein shall include materials whether made by polymerization of one type of monomer or made by two (i.e., copolymers) or more types of monomers.<br>
The term "water-soluble" as used herein, means that the polymer is soluble in water in the present composition. In general, the polymer should be soluble at 25 °C at a concentration of at least 0.1% by weight of the water solvent, preferably at least 1%, more preferably at least 5%, most preferably at least 15%.<br>
The term "particle size" as used herein refers to the average mean particle size of a group of particles in the final composition of the present invention. For opaque compositions and/or those containing small to large sized particles (i.e., about 100 nm to about 50 um), particle size may be measured by means of a laser light scattering technique, using a Horiba model LA 910 Laser Scattering Particle Size Distribution Analyzer (Horiba Instruments, Inc. Irvine, California, USA). For substantially clear compositions and/or those containing nano sized particles (i.e., less than about 100 nm), particle size may be measured by means of a dynamic light scattering controlled reference method (i.e., which uses a heterodyne detection technique), using a Microtrac® model UFA 150 Ultrafme Particle Size Analyzer (Honeywell, Inc., Industrial Automation and Control, St. Petersburg, Florida, USA).<br>
The transparency of the composition is measured by Ultra-Violet/Visible (UV/VIS) spectrophotometry, which determines the absorption or transmission of<br><br>
UV/VIS light by a sample.   A light wavelength of 600 nm has been shown to be adequate for characterizing the degree of clarity of non-colored cosmetic compositions. A.       Detersive Surfactant<br>
The compositions of the present invention comprise a detersive surfactant. The detersive surfactant component is included to provide cleaning performance to the composition. The detersive surfactant component in turn comprises anionic detersive surfactant, zwitterionic or amphoteric detersive surfactant, or a combination thereof. Such surfactants should be physically and chemically compatible with the essential components described herein, or should not otherwise unduly impair product stability, aesthetics or performance.<br>
Suitable anionic detersive surfactant components for use hi the composition herein include those which are known for use in hair care or other personal care cleansing compositions. The concentration of the anionic surfactant component in the composition should be sufficient to provide the desired cleaning and lather performance, and generally range from about 5% to about 35%, preferably from about 8% to about 30%, more preferably from about 10% to about 25%, even more preferably from about 12% to about 22%.<br>

The compositions of the present invention may further comprise additional surfactants for use in combination with the anionic detersive surfactant component described hereinbefore. Suitable optional surfactants include nonionic and cationic surfactants. Any such surfactant known in the art for use in hair or personal care products may be used, provided that the optional additional surfactant is also chemically and physically compatible with the essential components of the composition, or does not otherwise unduly impair product performance, aesthetics or stability. The concentration of the optional additional surfactants in the composition may vary with the cleansing or lather performance desired, the optional surfactant selected, the desired product concentration, the presence of other components in the composition, and other factors well known in the art.<br>
Non-limiting examples of other anionic, zwitterionic, amphoteric or optional additional   surfactants   suitable   for  use   in  the  compositions   are   described  in McCutcheon's,  Emulsifiers  and Detergents,   1989 Annual, published by M.  C. Publishing Co., and U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,929,678; 2,658,072; 2,438,091; and 2,528,378. B.       Galactomannan Polymer Derivative<br>
The personal care compositions of the present invention comprise a galactomannan polymer derivative having a mannose to galactose ratio of greater than 2 : 1 on a monomer to monomer basis, the galactomannan polymer derivative selected from the group consisting of a cationic galactomannan polymer derivative and an amphoteric galactomannan polymer derivative having a net positive charge. As used herein, the term "cationic galactomannan" refers to a galactomannan polymer to which a cationic group is added. The term "amphoteric galactomannan" refers to a galactomannan polymer to which a cationic group and an anionic group are added such that the polymer has a net positive charge.<br>
Galactomannan polymers are present in the endosperm of seeds of the Leguminosae family. Galactomannan polymers are made up of a combination of<br>
mannose monomers and galactose monomers. The galactomannan molecule is a straight chain mannan branched at regular intervals with single membered galactose units on specific mannose units. The mannose units are linked to each other by means of p (1-4) glycosidic linkages. The galactose branching arises by way of an a (1-6) linkage. The ratio of mannose monomers to galactose monomers varies according to the species of the plant and also is affected by climate. Guar is an example of one type of a galactomannan polymer, specifically having a mannose to galactose ratio of 2 monomers of mannose to 1 monomer of galactose. Galactomannan polymer derivatives of the present invention have a ratio of mannose to galactose of greater than 2 : 1 on a monomer to monomer basis (i.e., non-guar galactomannan polymers). Preferably, the ratio of mannose to galactose is greater than about 3:1, and more preferably the ratio of mannose to galactose is greater than about 4:1. Analysis of mannose to galactose ratios is well known in the art and is typically based on the measurement of the galactose content.<br>
The gum for use in preparing the non-guar galactomannan polymer derivatives is typically obtained as naturally occurring material such as seeds or beans from plants. Examples of various non-guar galactomannan polymers include but are not limited to Tara gum (3 parts mannose /1 part galactose), Locust bean or Carob (4 parts mannose / 1 part galactose), and Cassia gum (5 parts mannose / 1 part galactose).<br>

In one embodiment of the present invention, the galactomannan polymer derivatives have a molecular weight from about 5,000 to about 3,000,000. As used herein, the term "molecular weight" refers to the weight average molecular weight. The weight average molecular weight may be measured by gel permeation chromatography.<br>
The personal care compositions of the present invention include galactomannan polymer derivatives which have a cationic charge density from about 0.9 meq/g to about 7 meq/g. In one embodiment of the present invention, the galactomannan polymer derivatives have a cationinc charge density from about 1 meq/g to about 5 meq/g. The degree of substitution of the cationic groups onto the galactomannan structure should be sufficient to provide the requisite cationic charge density.<br>
In one embodiment of the present invention, the galactomannan polymer derivative is a cationic derivative of the non-guar galactomannan polymer, which is obtained by reaction between the hydroxyl groups of the polygalactomannan polymer and reactive quaternary ammonium compounds. Suitable quaternary ammonium compounds for use hi forming the cationic galactomannan polymer derivatives include those conforming to the general formula:<br>
wherein where R1, R2 and R3 are methyl or ethyl groups; R4 is either an epoxyalkyl group of the general formula:<br>
or R4 is a halohydrin group of the general formula:<br>
wherein R5 is a C1 to C3alkylene; X is chlorine or bromine, and Z is an anion such as Cl-,Br,I-orHSO4-.<br>
Cationic non-guar galactomannan polymer derivatives formed from the reagents described above are represented by the general formula:<br>
wherein R is the gum. Preferably, the cationic galactomannan derivative is a gum hydroxypropyltrimethylammonium chloride, which can be more specifically represented by the general formula:<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, the galactomannan polymer derivative is an amphoteric galactomannan polymer derivative having a net positive charge,<br>
obtained when the cationic galactomannan polymer derivative further comprises an anionic group.<br>
The personal care compositions of the present invention comprise at least about 0.05% of a galactomannan polymer derivative by weight of the composition. In one embodiment of the present invention, the personal care compositions comprise from about 0.05% to about 2 %, by weight of the composition, of a galactomannan polymer derivative.<br>
C.	Aqueous Carrier<br>
The personal care compositions of the present invention comprise an aqueous carrier. The level and species of the carrier are selected according to the compatibility with other components and other desired characteristic of the product. The aqueous carrier is present in an amount of at least about 20% preferably from about 20% to about 95% by weight of the composition. An aqueous carrier may be selected such that the composition of the present invention may be in the form of, for example, a pourable liquid, a gel, a paste, a dried powder, or a dried film.<br>
Aqueous carriers useful in the present invention include water and water solutions of lower alkyl alcohols. Lower alkyl alcohols useful herein are monohydric alcohols having 1 to 6 carbons, more preferably ethanol and isopropanol.<br>
The pH of the present composition, measured neat, is preferably from about 3 to about 9, more preferably from about 4 to about 8. Buffers and other pH-adjusting agents can be included to achieve the desirable pH.<br>
D.	Additional Components<br>
The personal care compositions of the present invention may further comprise one or more additional components known for use in hair care or personal care products, provided that the additional components are physically and chemically compatible with the essential components described herein, or do not otherwise unduly impair product stability, aesthetics or performance. Individual concentrations of such additional components may range from about 0.001% to about 10% by weight of the personal care compositions.<br>

agents, particles, suspending agents, paraffinic hydrocarbons, propellants, viscosity modifiers, dyes, non-volatile solvents or diluents (water-soluble and water-insoluble), pearlescent aids, foam boosters, additional surfactants or nonionic cosurfactants, pediculocides, pH adjusting agents, perfumes, preservatives, chelants, proteins, skin active agents, sunscreens, UV absorbers, and vitamins. 1. Conditioning Agent<br>
In one embodiment of the present invention, the personal care compositions comprise one or more conditioning agents. Conditioning agents include materials which are used to give a particular conditioning benefit to hair and/or skin. The conditioning agents useful in the compositions of the present invention typically comprise a water-insoluble, water-dispersible, non-volatile, liquid that forms emulsified, liquid particles. Suitable conditioning agents for use in the composition are those conditioning agents characterized generally as silicones (e.g., silicone oils, cationic silicones, silicone gums, high refractive silicones, and silicone resins), organic conditioning oils (e.g., hydrocarbon oils, polyolefins, and fatty esters) or combinations thereof, or those conditioning agents which otherwise form liquid, dispersed particles in the aqueous surfactant matrix.<br>
