DESCRIPTION<br>
MACHINE   FOR   FORMING   CAPS   BY   COMPRESSION   MOLDING<br>
5     TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to machines for forming articles, in particular<br>
closure caps, by compression molding.<br>
The ensuing description specifically relates to caps, but can equally relate<br>
to articles other than caps.<br>
10     BACKGROUND ART<br>
Such machines are known for example from US 5,807,592 in the name of<br>
the same applicant.<br>
Said machines comprise a rotating carousel for compression molding<br>
comprising a support element rotating about a central vertical axis.<br>
15     A plurality of compression molding units are mounted on the support<br>
etement equidistant from each other and from the axis of said carousel.<br>
Each of said units comprises a fixed upper punch and a lower mould<br>
provided with a cavity and movable vertically to engage and disengage the<br>
fixed upper punch.<br>
20     Machines are also known in which both the lower mould and the upper<br>
punch or just the upper punch alone are movable, but this does not modify<br>
that stated hereinafter.<br>
Means are provided to rotate said support element such that each molding<br>
unit undergoes a path of travel comprising a loading station for the<br>
25     material to be molded, a molding zone, a cooling zone and a zone for<br>
discharging the molded cap.<br>
1<br><br>
WO 2004/062874                                                                                             PCT/EP2003/044870<br>
The loading zone for the material to be molded and the cap discharge<br>
zone can be perfectly superposed, so that the two operations can be<br>
substantially simultaneous.<br>
Means are provided for causing said upper punches and said lower<br>
5      moulds to approach and withdraw from each other during rotation of the<br>
support element.<br>
The loading and discharge operations take place with the aid of at least<br>
one second carousel, known as the loading and discharge carousel, the<br>
active means of which follow a trajectory tangential to the trajectory of the<br>
10     mould on the support element, said operations being effected at the actual<br>
point of tangency.<br>
Of the said operations, the more delicate is the loading of the material<br>
charge to be molded, which must take place within a certain limited time if<br>
control of the characteristics of the material loaded into the mould cavity is<br>
15     to be maintained.<br>
The time which passes between loading one charge into the mould and<br>
loading the next charge into the same mould defines the duration of one<br>
cap forming cycle, which is dictated by plant requirements.<br>
The duration also comprises a time, ten own as the stoppage time, during<br>
so     which the mould, once the cap has been formed, hag to remain inactive for<br>
safety reasons in order to enable the carousel to halt should difficulties<br>
arise.<br>
Tire stoppage time corresponds to an arc of rotation of the carousel known<br>
as the stoppage arc, which is generally defined by the number of inactive<br>
25     moulds.<br>
2<br><br>
WO 2004/062874                                                                                             PCT/EP2003/044870<br>
The stoppage arc, which depends on inertial problems, is proportional to<br>
the square of the rotational speed of the carousel.<br>
There is therefore a compromise situation between the number of moulds<br>
on which the carousel diameter depends, and the carouse speed, which<br>
5     as stated influences the stoppage arc, this compromise enabling the<br>
characteristics of the carousel to be optimized on the basis of the desired<br>
production rate.<br>
The time required by the charge loading operation evidently limits the<br>
rotational speed of the carousel, this drawback being at least partly<br>
10     obviated by the said US 5,807,592 in the name of the same applicant, in<br>
which the loading and discharge carousel not only rotates about its axis<br>
but can also be shifted slightly to enable the loading means to remain over<br>
the mould cavity for a time exceeding the normal overlying time at the<br>
point of tangency.<br>
15     The invention of said US 5,807,592 presents not only a productivity limit<br>
depending on the rotational speed of the carousel carrying the moulds, but<br>
also a considerable mechanical complication due to the need to shift the<br>
axis off the loading and discharge carousel at each operation.<br>
Any increase in the carausel speed beyond title defined optimum speed is<br>
20     in effect prevented by the increase in the stoppage arc, which as seen is<br>
proportional to the square of the speed.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
The object of the present invention is to increase the production rate while<br>
at the same time also increasing the time available for loading the material<br>
25     change to be molded, for a carousel having the aforedefined optimum<br>
characteristics.<br>
3<br><br>
WO 2004/062874                                                                                             PCT/EP2003/044870<br>
I<br>
This object is attained by a machine having the characteristics defined in<br>
the claims.<br>
The simultaneity of the loading and discharge operations introduced by US<br>
5,307,592, which has enabled the production rate to be increased, is<br>
5     associated according to the invention with different modalities for feeding<br>
the charge.<br>
The machine of the invention presents a carousel having a diameter and a<br>
rotational speed such that during one complete revolution of the carousel<br>
at least two molding cycles are achieved for each mould, said cycles being<br>
10     also able to be partly concurrent.<br>
This solution offers advantages which are already apparent even if only<br>
two cycles are to be achieved for each revolution of the carousel.<br>
Taking as reference a carousel of the aforedefined optimum<br>
characteristics effecting one cycle for each revolution, if two cycles are to<br>
15      be effected for each revolution the rotational speed has to be halved 1o<br>
respect the cycle duration.<br>
However by halving the speed each of the two cycles will have a stoppage<br>
arc available which is four times that required for safety reasons.<br>
If the stoppage arc is defined by the number of moulds which have to<br>
20     remain inactive, and said number is equal to x for a certain rotational<br>
speed, then for a rotational speed which is halved said number becomes<br>
equal to 2ax.<br>
This not only enables a greater time to be available for loading the mould.<br>
but also enables the machine productivity to be further increased by<br>
25     simply resetting the stoppage arc to the value necessary to maintain<br>
safety.<br>
4<br><br>
WO 2004/062874                                                                                             PCT/EP2003/044870<br>
If then the two cycles for forming a cap in the same mould are partly<br>
superposed, namely during the loading of the change and during discharge<br>
of the cap, the aforesaid synergic effect is further increased.<br>
According to this preferential embodiment, each of the devices provided<br>
5     along the carousel circumference loads the charge of the next cycle and<br>
discharges the cap of the previous cycle.<br>
In conformity with the invention each cap is completely formed, starting<br>
with the loading of the charge and finishing with the discharge of the cap,<br>
within a path of travel exceeding that fraction of a revolution of the<br>
10     carousel undergone by each individual loading and discharge means<br>
associated with the carousel.<br>
This enables a carousel rotational speed, and hence a productivity, to be<br>
chosen between the speed undergone by the carousel if associated with a<br>
single device and the sub-multiple of said speed equal to the number of<br>
15     loading and discharge devices associated with the carousel.<br>
it has been found that, with reference to the maximum allowable speed of<br>
a carousel provided with a single loading and discharge device, a speed<br>
reduced by one third is advantageous for the same carousel provided with<br>
two loading and discharge devices.<br>
20     This enables the production to be increased by forty percent, while having<br>
a time period available for loading the charge which is increased by thirty<br>
percent.<br>
The merits and the constructional and operational characteristics of the<br>
invention will be apparent from the ensuing detailed description with<br>
25     reference to the accompanying drawings, which illustrate a preferred<br>
embodiment thereof given by way of non-limiting example.<br>

WO 2004/062874                                                                                             PCT/EP2003/044870<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
Figure 1 is a schematic plan view of a forming machine according to the<br>
invention.<br>
5     Figure 2 shows the section 11-11 of Figure 1.<br>
Figure 3 is an enlarged portion of Figure 2.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
The figures show a first carousel 1 which rotates about a vertical axis 2<br>
10     and carries, aligned and equidistant along a circumference, a certain<br>
number of molding stations 3 each of which comprises an upper punch 31<br>
and a lower die 32 arranged to define, in its simplest version, a forming<br>
cavity 320.<br>
External to the carousel 1 there are positioned, in diametrically opposite<br>
15     positions, two second carousels 4 for loading the charge and discharging<br>
the cap.<br>
In series with each of the second carousels 4 for loading the charge and<br>
simultaneously discharging the cap, there is positioned a third carousel 5<br>
provided with a star member 51, for removing the caps withdrawn by the<br>
20     second carousel.<br>
The means for synchronously rotating the carousel 1, the carousel 4 and<br>
the carousel 5 are not described as they are well known to the expert and<br>
are sufficiently illustrated in the aforesaid US 5,807,592 in the name of the<br>
same applicant.<br>
25     With each of the carousels 4 there are associated means for feeding<br>
charges of synthetic material to be molded, said means consisting, in the<br>
6<br><br>
WO 2004/062874                                                                                             PCT/EP2003/044870<br>
illustrated example, of an extruder 410 provided with a charge emission<br>
nozzle 420 shown in Figure 2.<br>
With particular reference to Figure 2, this shows a portion 6 of the machine<br>
bed on which the carousel 1 rotates.<br>
5     The portion 6 houses a motorized shaft 7 carrying the third carousel 5 at<br>
its top, and a pulley 8 keyed onto an intermediate zone.<br>
With the shaft 7 there is associated a rotatable bush 9 carrying a laterally<br>
projecting shelf 10. The shelf 10 is maintained in the desired position by a<br>
cylinder-piston unit of which only the piston rod 11 is visible.<br>
10     By way of a bush 12 and bearings 13, the shelf 10 supports a rotatable<br>
shaft 14, to the top of which the second carousel 4 is fixed.<br>
The lower end of the shaft 14 carries a pulley 15 which is rotatably<br>
connected to the pulley 8 of the shaft 7 by way of a toothed belt 16, the<br>
intermediate pulley 17 and the toothed belt 18.<br>
15     The carousel 4 comprises a base plate 41 keyed onto the shaft 14 and<br>
provided with charge withdrawal cups 42 positioned equidistant along a<br>
circumference and each connected to pneumatic means.<br>
Said means comprise a circular channel 43 provided within the shelf 10<br>
and connected by vertical conduits to an annular distributor 44 on which<br>
20     there sealedly slide the ends of conduits 45 connected to the perforated<br>
base of the cups 42.<br>
Above the plate 41 there is a plate 47 above which a star member 47 is<br>
positioned.<br>
It should be noted that the circumference along which the cups 42 are<br>
25     aligned is tangential to the circumference along which the punches 31 and<br>
the relative lower dies 32 are aligned.<br>
7<br><br>
WO 2004/062874                                                                                             PCT/EP2003/044870<br>
At a point external to the carousel 4 there is a nozzle 411 fed by the<br>
extruder 410, and by which the material charges to be molded are emitted.<br>
Said nozzle 411 is visible in Figure 2, and is aligned vertically with the<br>
circumference along which the cups 42 are aligned, it being external to the<br>
5     shelf 10.<br>
The machine operates in the following manner.<br>
For simplicity, it will be described with reference only to one forming cycle<br>
between two loading and discharge stations, relative to one half a<br>
revolution of the carousel 1.<br>
10     The extruder 410 feeds the carousel 4 with a series of material charges<br>
which leave one by one from the nozzle 411 and are collected by the cups<br>
42 as these pass above the nozzle; the charges remain in the cups by<br>
spontaneous adhesion.<br>
The carousel 4 rotates in phase and in synchronism with the rotation of the<br>
13     carousel 1, so that the cups 42 become successively aligned with the<br>
cavities 320 of the dies 32.<br>
The cavities 320 are empty, as the cap which has just been molded lies<br>
mounted on the punch 31 which is now spaced from the respective cavity<br>
320.<br>
20     The charge is made to fall into the respective cavity by pneumatic means<br>
which are well known and are therefore not described in detail.<br>
Simultaneously with the loading of the charge, suitable pneumatic means,<br>
not shown, present in the punch 31 cause the cap just formed to fall onto<br>
the plate 46, between the points of the star member 47.<br>
25     During the rotation of the carousel 4, the caps maintained equidistant by<br>
the star member 47 are led to the star member 51 of the carousel 5 which<br>
8<br><br>
WO 2004/062874                                                                                             PCT/EP2003/044870<br>
rotates synchronously and in phase with the star member 47, The star<br>
member 51 carries the caps to a fixed discharge chute 48 (Figure 1)<br>
located adjacent and coplanar to the plate 45.<br>
Having loaded the charge, the forming cycle commences witti the raising<br>
5     of the mould cavity 320 until it receives the punch 31, with the<br>
simultaneous formation of the cap by compressing the charge, followed by<br>
a stage in which the mould is cooled and opened.<br>
The open mould with the cap mounted on the punch reaches that carousel<br>
4 diametrically opposite to that in which the charge was loaded, and the<br>
10     cycle is repeated.<br>
It is apparent from the aforegoing that for each complete revolution of the<br>
carousel two caps are molded, each along a path bounded by one of the<br>
described loading and discharge stations, said two cycles being partially<br>
simultaneous with the loading of the charge and the discharge of the cap.<br>
15     The third carousel could also be omitted, and the caps abandoned by the<br>
second carousel be removed in another manner.<br>
