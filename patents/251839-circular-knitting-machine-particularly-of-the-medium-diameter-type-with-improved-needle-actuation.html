				<td>CIRCULAR KNITTING MACHINE, PARTICULARITY OF THE<br>
MEDIUM-DIAMETER TYPE, WITH IMPROVED NEEDLE<br>
AC TUATION<br>
Tec hnicai Field<br>
The present invention relates to a circular knitting machine,<br>
particularly of the medium-diameter type, with improved needle actuation.<br>
Background Art<br>
The field of circular knitting machine has always felt the need to<br>
red ace as much as possible the height of the needle cylinder so as to reduce<br>
its inertia, in order to be able to increase its rotation rate and therefore<br>
inc :ease correspondingly the productivity of these machines.<br>
However, this need clashes with an equally important need, which is<br>
vejsatility, i.e., the possibility to produce on a same machine various kinds<br>
of knitting process, the execution of whic;h often entails increasing even<br>
CO] isiderably the complexity of the needle actuation system, increasing the<br>
sp; ce occupation entailed by the installation of several accessories around<br>
the needle cylinder, which inevitably force an increase in the height of the<br>
ne^ :dle cylinder, which in practice constitutes the only dimensional variable<br>
thi t allows design freedom.<br>
, Furthermore, in circular knitting machines there has always been the<br>
ned to improve the quality level of the manufactured articles. In recent<br>
ye irs, this need, has increased, also because continuous improvements have<br>
allowed these machines to produce items that increasingly approximate<br>
firished items,- reducing and in some times eliminating the use of<br>
su )sequent processes.<br>
Furtheraiore, in needle actuation systems of machines of this type it<br>
ha; been noted that in any kind of knitting process the heel of the needles<br>
&amp;b /ays engages the lowering cams, i.e., the cams that lower the needle into<br>
thi; needle cylinder after engaging the yam at a drop or feed of the machine,<br>
ev in when the corresponding needle is excluded from knitting at a drop.<br>
, 2<br>
^. 'his engagement with the lowering cams produces unwanted movements of<br>
tie needle, and if the needle is holding previously formed knitting these<br>
r lovements can alter or even break the stitches, inevitably penalizing the<br>
c uality of the product.<br>
I &gt;isclosure of the Invention<br>
The aim of the present invention is to solve the problems noted above<br>
by providing a circular knitting machine, particularly of the medium-<br>
d iameter type, with a particularly simple needle actuation system that allows<br>
t() contain the axial dimensions of the needle cylinder without penalizing the<br>
r; nge of possible types of knitting.<br>
Within this aim, an object of the mvehtion is to provide a machine<br>
tl at can operate at high rotation rates of the needle cylinder and can<br>
tl erefore achieve high production levels.<br>
Another object of the invention is to provide a machine that thanks to<br>
a containment of the total weight of the needle cylinder and to the needle<br>
ai ;tuation system can operate without problems even in the case of medium-<br>
ai id large-diameter machines, with reversals of the direction of rotation of<br>
tl e needle cylinder, allowing types of knitting that have never been<br>
pi rformed up to now on these machines, such as for example the provision<br>
o: three-dimensional shapes without necessarily having to vary the tightness<br>
o: the knitting or introducing in preset regions portions of additional courses<br>
O; knitting that require unsightly trimming that is negative for the fit of the<br>
p] oduct.<br>
This aim and these and other objects that will become better apparent<br>
h( reinafter are achieved by a circular knitting machine, which comprises a<br>
footing that supports a needle cylinder that can be rotationally actuated with<br>
re ;pect to said footing about its own axis., which is orientated substantially<br>
Vâ‚¬ rtically; a plurality of axial slots being formed on the outer lateral surface<br>
ol the needle cylinder, each slot accormnodating a needle; means for<br>
acuating the needles being provided and interacting with said needles<br><br>
durii ,g the rotation of the needle cylinder about its own axis in order to<br>
actu Lte the needles along the corresponding axial slot of the needle cylinder<br>
so fiat the needles form knitting \vith at least one yam dispensed to the<br>
neec les at at least one drop or feed of the machine, characterized in that said<br>
neec le actuation means comprise, for each needle, a sub-needle arranged in<br>
the corresponding axial slot of the needle cyhnder below the corresponding<br>
neeule; said sub-needle being connected bilaterally to the coiTesponding<br>
neei [le in its m.otion along the corresponding axial slot and having, along its<br>
extf nsion, a heel that is orientated radially with respect to the needle<br>
cyli ider; said sub-needle being able to oscillate on a radial plane of the<br>
nee lie cylinder in order to pass from an active position, in which it is<br>
ext: acted radially with its heel from the corresponding axial slot of the<br>
needle cylinder so as to engage paths formed by sub-needle actuation cams,<br>
wh ch are arranged around the needle cylinder and are suitable to produce or<br>
all( 'W a movement of said sub-needle along the corresponding axial slot of<br>
the needle cylinder, to an inactive position, in which it is embedded with its<br>
he( 1 in the corresponding axial slot of the needle C3dinder so as to avoid<br>
en; paging said sub-needle actuation cams; actuation means being provided<br>
wl ich act on said sub-needle for its transition from said active position to<br>
sai d inactive position and vice versa.<br>

W lys to carrying out the Invention<br>
With reference to the figures, the circular laiitting machine according<br>
to he invention, generally designated by the reference numeral 1 and shown<br>
on y partially and schematically, comprises;, like known types of machine, a<br>
fo( 'ting, which is not illustrated for the sake of simplicity and supports a<br>
ne idle cylinder 2, which can rotate, with respect to the footing, about its<br>
ov n axis 2a, which is orientated substantially vertically. Multiple axial slots<br>
3 i re formed on the outer lateral surface of the needle cylinder 2 and each<br>
sic; accommodates a needle 4.<br>
The mEichine comprises means for actuating the needles 4, which are<br>
de: cribed in greater detail hereinafter and interact with the needles 4 during<br>
the rotation of the needle cylinder 2 about its own axis 2a in order to actuate<br>
the needles 4 along the corresponding axial slot 3 so that the needles 4 form<br>
1 nitting with at least one yam, which is dispensed to tlie needles 4 at at least<br>
c ne feed or drop 5, which is an-anged laterally to the axis 2a and at which<br>
Â£ ppropriately provided yam fingers 6 are positioned.<br>
According to the invention, the needle actuation means comprise, for<br>
e ach needle 4, a sub-needle 7, which is arranged below the con'esponding<br>
r eedle 4 in the same axial slot 3 of the needle cylinder 2. The sub-needle 7<br>
i; connected bilaterally, in its motion along the corresponding axial slot 3,<br>
i e., parallel to the axis 2a of the needle cjdinder 2, to the overlying needle 4,<br>
aid has, along its longitudinal extension, a heel 7a, which is orientated<br>
r idially with respect to the needle cylinder 2. The bilateral connection<br>
between the needle 4 and the sub-needle 7 is achieved by virtue of a<br>
particular geometric coupling between the upper end of the sub-needle 7<br>
aid the lower end of the needle 4. This coupling, in addition to providing<br>
s lid bilateral connection, allows the sub-needle 7 to oscillate on a radial<br>
p ane of the needle cylinder 2 in order to pass from an active position, in<br>
V hich it is extracted radially with its heel 7a from the corresponding axial<br>
s ot 3 of the needle cylinder 2, to an inactive position, in which it is<br>
e nbedded with its heel 7a in the corresponding axial slot 3.<br>
Sub-needle actuation cams, generally designated by the reference<br>
n imeral 8, face and lie around the outer lateral surface of the needle<br>
c Tinder 2, at a level that corresponds to the level of the heels 7a of the sub-<br>
n jedles 7, are rigidly coupled to the footing of the machine as regards rotaiy<br>
n otion about the axis 2a, and define paths that are engaged by the heels 7a<br>
o^the sub-needles 7 when they are in the active position and vice versa are<br>
n )t engaged by the heels 7a of the sub-needles 7 that are in the inactive<br>
p )sition. The paths defined by the actuation cams 8 of the sub-needles 7 are<br>
s] taped so as to force or allow the sub-needles 7, the heels 7a of which<br>
e: igage said paths, an upward or downward motion along the corresponding<br>
a :ial slot 3 of the needle cylinder 2 as a consequence of tlie rotation of the<br>
n ;edle cylinder 2 about the axis 2a with respect to said cams 8.<br><br>
The needle 4 also has, along its longitudinal extension, a heel 4a that<br>
ies radially with respect to the needle cylinder 2 and can engage paths<br>
lefined by needle actuation cams, generally designated by the reference<br>
I Lumeral 9 and rigidly coupled to the footing of the machine as regards<br>
] otary motion about the axis 2a. Said paths are shaped so as to force or<br>
; How the needles 4, the heels 4a of which engage said paths, an upward or<br>
(-OAvnv/ard motion along the corresponding axial slot 3 of the needle<br>
(ylinder 2 as a consequence of the rotation of the needle cylinder 2 about<br>
tie axis 2a with respect to the cams 9.<br>
The means for actuating the needles 4 furthermore comprise sub-<br>
r eedle actuation means that act on command on the sub-needle 7 in order to<br>
j: roduce its transition from the inactive position to the active position or vice<br>
\ersa.<br>
Said means for actuating the sub-needle 7 comprise, for each sub-<br>
r eedle 7, an actuation element 10, which is arranged in each one of the axial<br>
s ots 3 below the sub-needle 7 and can move on command along the axial<br>
s ot 3, i.e., parallel to the axis 2a of the needle cylinder 2, in order to interact<br>
V ith the lower end of the sub-needle 7 and produce its transition or retention<br>
h. the inactive position or in the active position.<br>
The actuation element 10 comprises a selector 11, which is provided,<br>
a ong its longitudinal extension, with at least one heel 11a, lib that is<br>
e: [tended radially with respect to the needle cylinder 2. In the illustrated<br>
e-; nbodiment, the selector 11 is provided with two heels, respectively a lower<br>
h ;el 11a and an upper heel lib, which are mutually spaced along the<br>
k ngitudinal extension of the selector 11.<br>
The selector 11 can oscillate on a radial plane with respect to the<br>
ni edle cylinder 2 in order to pass froiri an active position, in which it<br>
p] otrudes radially with its lower heel 11a from the corresponding axial slot<br>
3. to an inactive position, in which it is embedded with its lower heel 11 a in<br>
th 3 corresponding axial slot 3.<br><br>
The upper heel lib is constantly extracted from the con"esponding<br>
axitlslotS.<br>
Selector actuation cams, generally designated by the reference<br>
nui leral 12, are arranged so as to face and lie around the needle cylinder 2<br>
at L level that corresponds to the level of the selectors 11, and are rigidly<br>
coi pled to the footing of the machine as regards rotaiy motion about the<br>
axj 3 2a. The selector actuation cams 12 define paths that can be engaged by<br>
the upper heel lib and by the lower heel 11a when it is in the active<br>
po ition. These paths are shaped so as to force or allow the selectors 11, the<br>
he ;ls 11a, lib of which engage said paths, an upward or downward motion<br>
al( ng the corresponding axial slot 3 of the needle cylinder 2 as a<br>
CO isequence of the rotation of the needle cylinder 2 about the axis 2a with<br>
re: pect to the cams 12.<br>
The upper heel lib, which is constantly extracted from the<br>
cc rresponding axial slot 3, is used mainly to actuate the lowering of the<br>
se .ector 11 by means of a part of the selector actuation cams 12.<br>
The selectors 11 have, in a per se known manner, along their<br>
Icagitudinal extension, one or more selection tabs He, on which selection<br>
devices 43a, 43b, 43c, 43d that face the outer lateral surface of the needle<br>
c; iinder 2 act on command in order to produce the transition of tiie<br>
C' )rresponding selector 11 from the active position to the inactive position.<br>
Transition of the selectors 11 from the inactive position to the active<br>
p Dsition can be achieved in a manner similar to what occurs for oscillating<br>
s electors in Icnown types of machine, for example by virtue of extraction<br>
cmis 13, which are arranged proximate to the lower end of the needle<br>
c ylinder 2 and act on the lower end of the selectors 11. The selection<br>
c evices, as well as the ex.traction cams 13, are arranged upstream of each<br>
( rop 5 of the machine along the direction of rotation of the needle cylinder 2<br>
i bout its own axis 2a with respect to the cam box.<br>
The lower end of the sub-needle 7 is conveniently shaped<br>
CO nplementarily with respect to the upper end of the actuation element 10,<br>
so that a movement of the actuation element 10 along the corresponding<br>
ax al slot 3 of the needle cylinder 2 produces the transition of the sub-needle<br>
7 i :om the inactive position to the active position or vice versa.<br>
Conveniently, the lower end of the sub-needle 7 has a forked shape,<br>
in which a first prong 14a protrudes downward with respect to the second<br>
pn ng 14b.<br>
The first prong 14a is furthermore closer to the bottom, i.e., to the<br>
wa.l directed toward the axis 2a, of the coiTesponding axial slot 3, than the<br>
sec ond prong 14b. The first prong 14a can be engaged by an upper portion<br>
of he actuation element 10 in order to move or stably retain the sub-needle<br>
7 h I its inactive position, while the second prong 14b can be engaged by the<br>
up] ler portion of the actuation element 10 in order to move or stably retain<br>
the sub-needle 7 in the active position.<br>
Fuithermore, the upper portion of the actuation element 10 can be<br>
ins ;rted between the two prongs 14a, 14b of the lower end of the sub-needle<br>
for the very purpose of reinforcing the retention of the sub-needle 7 in the<br>
act ve position.<br>
Conveniently, the actuation element 10 comprises, in addition to the<br>
sel( ctor 11, a pusher 15, which is acconmiodated so that it can slide within<br>
the corresponding axial slot 3 of the needle; cylinder 2 between the selector<br>
11 Old the sub-needle 7.<br>
In practice, the upper portion of the actuation element 10 that engages<br>
the lower end of the sub-needle 7 is constituted by the upper portion of the<br>
pusier 15.<br>
The pusher 15 has, along its longitudinal extension, a heel 15a that<br>
pro rudes from the corresponding axial slot 3 of the needle cylinder 2 and<br>
can engage paths formed by pusher actuation cams, generally designated by<br>
the reference numeral 16, which are rigidly coupled to the footing of the<br>
mac hine as regards rotation about the axis 2a. The paths defined by the<br>
ictuation cams 16 of the pushers are shaped so as to force or allow the<br>
Dushers 15, the heels 15a of which engage said paths, an upward or<br>
iownward motion along the corresponding axial slot 3 of the needle<br>
cylinder 2 as a consequence of the rotation of the needle cylinder 2 about<br>
he axis 2a with respect to the cams 16.<br>
The upper portion of each pusher 15 has, in a region that is spaced<br>
iov/nward from the upper end of said pusher 15, a first region 17, which<br>
bi-ms an inclined plane with respect to the longitudinal extension of the<br>
'on-esponding axial slot 3 and can engage a con'esponding region 18 that<br>
"onus an inclined plane and is provided at the lower end of the first prong<br>
4a of the fork of the sub-needle 7, in order to achieve the transition of the<br>
ub-needle 7 from the active position to the inactive position as a<br>
' consequence of the downward movement of the pusher 15 along the<br>
The upper portion of each pusher 15 furthennore has, at its upper end,<br>
;. second region 19, which fonns an inclined plane with respect to the<br>
' ongitudinal extension of the corresponding axial slot 3 and can engage a<br>
( orresponding region 20, which forms an inclined plane and is provided at<br>
lh,e lower end of the second prong 14b of the fork of the sub-needle 7, in<br>
(-rder to achieve the transition of the sub--needle 7 from the inactive position<br>
1o the active position as a consequence of the upward movement of the<br>
] 'Usher 15 along the corresponding axial slot 3 of the needle cylinder 2.<br>
At the fork of the lower end of the sub-needles 7, the axial slots 3<br>
1 ave, on their bottom, a recessed region 25 for containing said fork and for<br>
c Uowing the oscillation of the sub-needle 7. Optionally, the upper part of<br>
5 aid recessed region 25 ma}^ be shallower than the remaining part, so as to<br>
i 31111 a supjDOrt for the forked region at least in the condition of maximum<br>
1 fting of the sub-needle 7 that retains it stably in the active position.<br>
The paths defined by the selector actuation cams 12 have, ahead of<br>
t ach drop 5 along the direction of rotation of the needle cylinder 2 about the<br><br>
axis Za with respect to the cam box, a first rising portion 21 and a second<br>
risin g portion 22, in which the peak is higher than the pealc of the first rising<br>
port on 21 in order to produce lifting respectively up to a tuck-stitch lifting<br>
leve 1 and to a drop-stitch lifting level for the overlying needle 4. The rising<br>
por ions 21 and 22 are designed to be engaged by the lower heel 1 la of the<br>
sell ctors 11 in the active position.<br>
Aliead of each drop or feed 5 of the machine along the direction of<br>
roi ation of the needle cylinder 2 about its own axis 2a with respect to the<br>
ca n box, four selection devices are provided: two of said devices are<br>
lo :ated between the first rising portion 21 and the second rising portion 22.<br>
Preferably, the knitting forming cams, also known as lowering cams,<br>
i. 2., the cams that produce the descent of the needles after engaging the yam<br>
Â£; a drop, in the machine according to the invention, are part of the actuation<br>
( ams 8 of the sub-needles 7.<br>
The lowering cams can be movable on command, in a per se known<br>
nanner, parallel to the axis 2a in order to vary the tightness of the knitting.<br>
Preferably, the machine according to the invention has four drops or<br>
feeds 5, which are mutually angularly spaced around the axis 2a of the<br>
needle cylinder 2.<br>
In the machine according to the invention, the needle actuation means<br>
4 allow to simplify the cam box and the accessory elements that are usually<br>
arranged around the needle cylinder and at the same time allow to perfonn<br>
substantially all the knitting processes currently possible in knitting<br>
machines, obtaining qualitatively superior results, as well as knitting<br>
processes that currently cannot be obtained on circular knitting machines<br>
having a medium diameter or more specifically having a diameter<br>
substantially comprised between 7 and 24 inches.<br>
Without altering the fact that the machine according to the invention,<br>
with its particular needle actuation means, may be provided with any<br>
diameter and as a machine in which the needle cylinder can be actuated with<br><br>
a rotary motion in a single direction of rotation without thereby abandoning<br>
the scope of the protection of the present invention, tiie particular means for<br>
the actuation of tlie needles of the machine according to the invention allow<br>
to contain the height and therefore the inertia of the needle cylinder,<br>
allowing its rotary actuation about its axis 2a in both directions of rotation.<br>
Said means for the actuation of the needles 4, in view of the way in which<br>
they are structured, can be used to alloAv the needles 4 to form knitting in<br>
both directions of rotation of the needle cylinder 2 about its own axis 2a at<br>
at least one drop 5.<br>
The embodiment of the machine according to the invention shown in<br>
:he accompanying drawings indeed refers to a machine with a needle<br>
cylinder 2 which, depending on the knitting requirements, can be actuated<br>
/vith a continuous motion in one direction of rotation or in the opposite<br>
lirection or with an alternating motion (or oscillating motion) about its own<br>
ixis 2a.<br>
In this embodiment, at at least one; drop and preferably at each drop,<br>
here are two mutually opposite lowering cams 23. and 24 for lowering the<br>
: leedles after the yam has been engaged at the drop being considered; said<br>
I ams are designed to be used respecti vety in the rotaiy motion of the needle<br>
( ylinder 2 in one direction or in the opposite direction.<br>
It is possible to use, for the actuation of the needle c^dinder 2 with a<br>
] Dtary motion about its own axis 2a, an electric motor of a known type that<br>
L Hows to reverse the rotation of its output shaft, or said rotary motion<br>
I jversal can be achieved by virtue of a tnmsmission interposed between the<br>
I lotor and the needle cylinder 2.<br>
The needle cylinder 2 can be proA'ided, in a per se Imown mamier,<br>
\ dth means for controlling its angular position about the axis 2a, such as for<br>
e -iample devices such as encoders or the like, so as to allow to control the<br>
p Dsition of the various needles 4 about the axis 2a during the rotation of the<br>
c /linder 2.<br><br>
The machine is preferably provided with an actuation and control<br>
clement of the programmable electronic type, which supervises the<br>
(&gt;peration of the various elements of the machine so as to be able to perforai<br>
] nitting according to preset programs.<br>
The means for actuating the needles 4, described earlier, can be used<br>
13 actuate the needles 4 so that they form knitting in both directions of the<br>
r Dtation of the needle cylinder 2 about its own axis 2a at all the drops 5.<br>
Figures 1 to 4, described in greater detail hereinafter, illustrate in a<br>
f at projection view a portion of the cam box of the machine. The illustrated<br>
p ortion, relates to a little more than one drop 5, and preferably this<br>
c jnfiguration of the cams is repeated as regards the other drops of the<br>
n achine.<br>
In practice, in a machine equipped with needles and needle actuation<br>
n eans according to the invention and meant to be used to form knitting in<br>
b )th directions of rotation of the needle cylinder 2 about its own axis 2a, the<br>
airangement and configuration of the needle actuation cams 9, of the sub-<br>
ni :edle actuation cams 8, of the pusher actuation cams 16 and of the selector<br>
a( tuation cams 12 is preferably symmetrical with respect to a radial plane of<br>
tfc 2 needle cylinder that passes through a drop or feed. A similar syrmnetry<br>
al 50 occurs in. the arrangement of the selection devices 43 a, 43b, 43 c, 43 d.<br>
The machine is completed with the elements that are usually present<br>
in circular knitting machines of this type, such as for example sinlcers, fabric<br>
te isioning devices, various control systems, etcetera.<br>
Optionally, the machine can be equipped with needles 4, sub-needles<br>
7 . tnd pushers 15 that have mutually different heel lengths.<br>
Merely by way of example. Figures 1 to 4 illustrate four different<br>
op ^rating conditions of a needle of the machine according to the invention.<br>
Tl e direction of rotation of the needle cylinder 2 in the various figures is<br>
indicated by the aiTOW 30. The portions. Qf the paths of the heels of the<br>
va ious elements in the active position have been shown by means of solid<br><br>
I: ars, while the portions of the paths of the heels of the various elements in<br>
t le inactive position have been shown by means of broken lines. The needle<br>
-, the sub-needle 7, the pusher 15 and the selector 11 have been shown,<br>
1 iterally with respect to the cam box portion, turned through 90Â° in a merely<br>
t xemplitying position, since the position of these elements can vary<br>
J ccording to the imparted actuation, as described below.<br>
Figure 1 illustrates the condition in v/hich the needle is excluded from<br>
1 nitting at a drop or feed 5 of the machine. To achieve this condition, the<br>
selector 11 of the needle 4 being considered is retained in the inactive<br>
jiosition by way of the selection devices. In this manner, the pusher 15,<br>
; head of the drop being considered, is first lowered together with the sub-<br>
] leedle 7 and then returned to the lowermost position, causing the transition<br>
(if the sub-needle 7 to the inactive position. In this manner, the<br>
( orresponding needle 4 passes with its head below the lowering plane of the<br>
; inkers of the machine.<br>
It should be noted that in this operating condition the heel 7a of the<br>
ub-needle 7 does not engage the lowering cams 23, 24, thus avoiding even<br>
mall movements of the needle excluded from knitting, which occur in<br>
mown t3'pes of machine and cause accidental breakage of the fabric when<br>
he needles that are excluded from knitting at the feed being considered<br>
;arry knitting formed at other feeds of the machine.<br>
Figure 2 illustrates the actuation of a needle 4 for fonning a drop<br>
jtitch.<br>
In this case, the selector 11 of the needle 4 being considered is<br>
â€¢etained or moved into the active position by means of the selection devices<br>
&gt;o that its lower heel 11a engages both the rising portion 21 and the rising<br>
3ortion 22 of the path defined by the cams 12. In this maimer, the pusher 15,<br>
after being lifted by tlie upward motion of the selector 11 engaged with the<br>
first rising portion 21 and.assj^sted by a cam 31 of the actuation cams 16 of<br>
said pusher 15, is lowered by a cam 32 that again belongs to the cams 16<br><br>
md causes the momentary transition of the sub-needle 7 into the inactive<br>
position in order to allow it to move beyond the lowering cam 23 without<br>
engaging it. The additional lifting produced b}' the engagement of the<br>
)usher 15 with the cam 33, which again belongs to the actuation cams 16 of<br>
he pusher 15, and of the selector 11 with the rising portion 22, produces the<br>
ifting of the needle 4 up to the point where the previously formed loop of<br>
aiitting is dropped onto the stem of the needle 4 before the needle 4 takes<br>
he yam dispensed at the drop being considered and begins a new descent.<br>
Figure 3 illustrates the actuation of a needle to form a tuck stitch.<br>
In this case, the selector 11, by virtue of the selection devices, is<br>
engaged only with the rising portion 21. In this manner, the pusher 15<br>
\ lehaves as in Figure 2, except that at the drop. 5 it does not receive the<br>
: urther upward motion that would be produced by the engagement of the<br>
: elector 11 with the cam 22. For this reason, the needle 4 is raised to a lesser<br>
( xtent, and the loop of knitting is not dropped onto the stem of the needle 4<br>
1 'cfore taking a new yam at the drop or feed being considered, but remains<br>
i 1 the hook of the needle 4, which fonns a new loop of loiitting.<br>
Figure 4 illustrates the actuation of a needle to form a floated stitch.<br>
In this case, the actuation of the various elements is similar to the one<br>
(escribed with reference to Figure 2, except that a movable cam 35 is<br>
i iserted so as to act between the pusher actuation cams 16, causing a greater<br>
lifting of the needle 4 before it reaches the drop 5. Said greater lifting of the<br>
1 eedle 4 has the effect of causing the transfer of the previously formed loop<br>
(f knitting onto the stem of the needle 4 below the latch. In this condition,<br>
t le needle 4 can then be actuated, by way of the selection device 43 d, so as<br>
t D reach a drop-stitch level, or can be retained at a tuck-stitch level. These<br>
t vo IqvgIs of lifting of the needle 4 can be used to make the needle engage<br>
c ifferent yams dispensed at the drop 5, for example in order to make it<br>
e ngage two yams when performing drop-stitch lifting and a single yam<br>
\ ^hen perfomiing tuck-stitch lifting.<br><br>
Figure 4 illustrates the lifting of the needle 4 to the drop-stitch level.<br>
It should be noted that in the machine according to the invention, the<br>
leedle actuation means, constituted by the sub-needles, pushers and<br>
electors, and the airangement and distribution of the functions of the<br>
Lctuation cams of these elements allow to have as many as four selection<br>
)oints, two for each direction of rotation of the needle cylinder about its<br>
. )wn axis, at each feed of the machine, with selection devices that can be<br>
: dTanged at the same vertical elevation.<br>
Furthermore, the set of needle actuation means allows to contain<br>
I onsiderably the height of the needle cylinder and therefore to contain the<br>
inertia of the needle cylinder, allowing its actuation with an alternating<br>
] otary motion, even at relatively high speeds, about its own axis.<br>
The possibility to rotationally actuate the needle cylinder in both<br>
(directions of rotation and in particular the possibility to actuate the needle<br>
(ylinder with an alternating rotary motion about its own axis allows to<br>
] iroduce without problems three-dimensional shapes on the tubular articles<br>
1 lat can produced with the machine, and to produce reinforced regions<br>
-^ /ithout vaiying the tightness of the knitting and without having to produce<br>
]ortions of courses of knitting to be trimmed.<br>
In alternating motion, for producing contoured pouches, it is possible<br>
t D perforai knitting with progressive increases and decreases of the active<br>
I eedles simply by using the needle selection possibilities offered by the<br>
1 lachine with adequate programming of the operation of the selection<br>
( evices.<br>
In addition to these possibilities, the machine according to the<br>
i ivention is capable of producing intarsia knitting, plated fabrics, Jacquard<br>
1 nitting on three technical tracks, striped fabrics, tuck-stitch knitting and<br>
i l.oated-stitch knitting.<br>
In practice it has been found that the machine according to the<br>
i ivention fully achieves the intended aim, since the particular needle<br><br>
adaation system allows to simplify the cam box, to contain the vertical<br>
sp; ,ce occupation of the needle cylinder, to perform the knitting processes<br>
the t can be performed by currently conim:ercially available machines and<br>
aho knitting processes that currently cannot be obtained in medium-<br>
di; meter circular,machines.<br>
In particular, the needle actuation system of the machine according to<br>
thi invention is suitable to be used to perform needle cylinder actuation in<br>
bc;h directions of rotation, allowing to produce, even on medium- and<br>
lai ge- diameter machines, articles that have three-dimensional shapes<br>
wi thout necessarily resorting to variations in the tightness of the knitting<br>
an d without requiring the execution of additional portions of courses with<br>
yam trimming. The niachine according to the invention also allows to<br>
pe rfonn intarsia knitting, i.e., knitting with colored designs without floated<br>
yÂ£ ms on the reverse side.<br>
The machine according to the invention is therefore capable of<br>
producing items of clothing of superior quality with respect to what can be<br>
ac hieved with circular knitting machines of a conventional type.<br>
The machine thus conceived is suscejptible of numerous modifications<br>
at d variations, all of which are within the scope of the appended claims;<br>
moreover, all the details may be replaced with other technically equivalent<br>
elements.<br>
In practice, the materials used may be any according to requirements<br>
ai id to the state of the art.<br>
