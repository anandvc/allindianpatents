The present invention generally relates to a synthetic resin corrugated pipe which is suitable for indoor/outdoor use and for either above ground or underground use. More specifically, the invention relates to a pipe used for protecting electric wiring, optical fiber cables, electric power cabling and" similar linear structures. Further, the invention relates to multi-pipe lines that include parallel, bundled pipes. Description of the Related Art<br>
A first conventional synthetic resin corrugated pipe contains a pipe wall having an annular- or helical-shaped convex-concave surface.  Such a shape improves the strength of the pipe and keeps  the pipe  from being flattened.  The above synthetic resin corrugated pipe is ■used to protect electric wires, to feed water, and the like.  In one configuration, a bundle of pipes is provided        as a "C.C. BOX"/ which is a multipurpose duct that houses        underground electric wires, optical fiber cables, electric        power cables, or the like.<br><br>
	Another conventional synthetic resin corrugated<br><br>
pipe has a pipe wall with a convex-concave surface in which<br>
the concave portions and convex portions are both circular.<br>
Alternatively, a rectangular ■ pipe with a convex-concavo<br>
surface includes a rectangular concave portion and a<br>
rectangular convex portions.<br>
It is difficult to maintain a bundle of circular<br>
pipes parallel because the positional stability of the<br>
circular pipes is poor, especially when such circular pipes<br>
are bundled in parallel, to form a multi-pipe line used<br>
underground  because dirt and sand enter between the<br>
circular pipes and disturb the linear alignment of the<br>
.individual circular pipes. Accordingly a cable or wire may<br>
"zigzag" when inserted into the pipe.   This problem<br>
	increases wiring resistance and makes it difficult to<br>
	Conventional rectangular pipes have flat sides<br>
	which fit against one another and prevent dirt and sand<br>
	from entering between the individual pipes of a multi-pipe<br>
bundle.  However, when a wire or cable is inserted into the<br>
rectangular pipe, the wire or cable typically moves toward<br>
       a corner portion of the pipe, particularly in a curved        portion  of  the  rectangular  pipe.    Accordingly,  the<br><br>
      rectangular pipe has a high wiring resistance and it is<br>
    difficult to insert multiple cables therein.  Therefore, a rectangular pipe is generally hot used to carry or protect<br><br>
cables or lines.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
An object of the present inventi'bn is to over coir,= the aforementioned problems of conventional circular or rectangular pipes.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a synthetic resin corrugated pipe having a special structure designed to solve the problems of the conven¬tional pipe.<br>
A third object of the present invention is to<br>
produce a pipe as easily as the conventional pipe, but<br>
., without increased cost and the pipe is designed to have the<br>
same strength against being flattened by pressure as the<br>
conventional pipe, even though the pipe is formed only from<br>
	synthetic resin.<br>
More specifically, the synthetic resin corrugated pipe according to the present invention is configured so<br><br>
	that the pipe wall is shaped to have an annular or helical<br>
convex-concave surface.  Each convex portion of the convex-<br>
concave surface has a quadrangular cross-sectional shape.<br>
Each concave portion of the convex-concave surface is<br>
shaped to have a circular cross-sectional shape.<br>
	Since  each  of  the  convex  portions  has  a<br>
	Quadrangular shape, the pipe can be laid flat stably and<br>
positioned easily.  The flat surface of the pipe prevents<br><br><br>
the pipe from being displaced after positioning thereof. The ribs of the circular concave portions project into -the pipe and support the cable and allow the cable to ho inserted into the pipe with minimum resistance.<br><br>
The present invention further includes a<br>
structure in which a quadrangular fitting pipe portion has<br>
an internal size and shape substantially equal to the<br>
external size and shape of the convex portions which allows<br>
the pipes to be joined easily. The fitting pipe portion is<br>
formed integrally on one end of the pipe and an insertion<br>
connection portion is formed on the other end of the pipe.<br>
.The fitting pipe portion and the insertion connection<br>
portion are fitted together to join the pipes. The<br>
insertion connection portion has a special concave portion<br>
with a size and shape corresponding to those of the convex<br>
portions. The fitting portion and the insertion portion may<br>
	be cylindrical.<br>
	Furthermore, when multiple pipes are arranged in<br><br>
a parallel, bundled to form a multi-pipe line, the parallel<br>
alignment of the individual pipes is easily maintained<br>
because of 'the flat surfaces of the convex portions.  The<br>
	foregoing structure prevents a large amount of dirt, sand<br>
	and other contaminants from entering between the individual<br><br>
-<br><br>
pipes.  Thus, the pipe according to the present invention is highly suitable for underground piping.<br><br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a synthetic resin corrugated pipe comprising a pipe wall having one of an annularly- and a helically-shaped convex-concave surface, said convex-concave surface ha^dng a plurality of convex portions ha\ing a quadrangular cross-sectional shape and a plurality of concave portions having a circular cross-sectional shape.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
Hereinbelow and referring to the attached drawings, preferred embodiments of the present invention will be described. For clarity and ease of understanding, like elements have the same reference numerals throughout the drawings.<br>
Referring to Figures 1-3, a pipe P according to<br>
	a first embodiment of the present invention has a pipe wall<br>
	1 which has an annular, convex-concave corrugated surface.<br><br>
	The convex portions 2 of the convex-concave corrugated<br>
	surface each have an internal and external square cross-<br>
	sectional shape with rounded  (i.e., arc-shaped)  corner<br>
portions.    Concave  portions  3  of  the  convex-concave<br>
	corrugated surface each have an internal and external circular cross-sectional shape. <br>
	The concave  portions 2 and convex portions 3 are<br>
        alternately disposed along the axis of the pipe.  However,<br>
the convex-concave corrugated surface of the pipe wall 1 is<br>
not limited to such an annular convex-concave corrugated<br>
surface, but also may be provided as a helical convex-<br><br><br>
ft.<br><br>
concave corrugated surface or other similar shape. Moreover, the cross-sectional shape of each of the convex portions 2 described herein is not limited to a square shape, but may be a rectangular shape elongated trans¬versely or longitudinally.<br>
As knave by the ordinarily skilled artisan taking the present application as a whole, the pipes P having the aforementioned structure can be formed by many methods, including extruding melted resin into a known caterpillar-type, pipe-forming consecutive mold from a resin extruder to form a tube. Generally, high-pressure air is blown into -the tube or air is sucked from the mold simultaneously, whereby the melted tube is pressed against the mold to continuously form the pipes P. The synthetic resin material for forming the pipe wall 1 of the pipe P of the present invention can include, polyethylene, polyvinyl chloride, polypropylene and/or any other suitable synthetic resin material. The pipe P is preferably formed solely from synthetic resin.<br>
Figures 4 and 5 respectively show first and second joints for connecting the pipes P. In the connection joints shovm in Figure 4, square ring-shaped pickings 12 each have a circular cavity of a size substantially equal to that of the concave portion 3 and a square external circumference,' size and shape analogous to<br><br>
the circumference, size and shape of the convex portions 2, but larger than the external size and shape of the convex portions 2.<br>
When joining first and second pipes P, the ring-shaped packings 12 are fitted onto the end portions of the first and second pipes P and then the first and second pipes P are pressed into a rectangular pipe-shaped joint 10 from opposite sides. The pipe-shaped joint 10 has recesses for accommodating the packings 12. Another ring-like packing 11 is interposed between the end surfaces of the first and second pipes P to seal the pipesIn the connection joint shown in Figure 5, square<br>
ring-shaped packings 13 each have a channel-shaped cross-<br>
section. To form the joint, the packings 13 are fitted<br>
onto the convex portions 2 located near the end portions of<br>
first and second pipes P. The first and second pipes P are<br>
pressed into a rectangular pipe-like joint 10. Other ring-<br>
IH	shaped packings 11 are interposed between opposite sides fan intermediate re-entrant groove 10a of the joint 10. The re-entrant groove 10a is a groove which presses the '«^ packings 11 against the ends of the pipes P. Further, motion stop pins 14 are fitted onto the outer circumference •X)       of the joint for securing the joint and ensuring the pipes<br><br><br>
are reliably coupled together.<br>
A second embodiment is shown in Figures 6 and 7.<br><br>
A difference between the first and second embodiments is that the second embodiment has a -quadrangular-section fitting pipe-shaped portion 4 which has an internal sizu and shape substantially equal to those of a convex portion 2. Further, a re-entrant groove 4a is continuously and integrally formed on one end side h (e.g., the right end side in Figure 6) of a pipe P. An insertion connection portion 5 has a special concave portion 3a continuously and integrally formed on a second end side c. (e.g., a left side in Figure 6) of the pipe P.<br>
To connect pipes P, as shown in Figure 7, a<br>
■■ rectangular-section 0-ring 15 is fitted into the special<br>
concave portion 3a.  The outer circumferential portion of<br>
the 0~ring 15 projects over the convex portions 2.  To form<br>
	the  joint,  the  pipe  section  c. is  pressed  into  the<br>
	rectangular fitting pipe-like portion 4 so that the outward<br>
	projecting  portion  of  the  0-ring  15  fits  into  the<br>
	re-entrant groove 4a.<br>
	Although the embodiment shown in Figure 5 has an<br>
and a special concave portion 3B.,   the insertion connection portion 5 is not always needed.  That is, as a modified<br>
	insertion connection portion 5 vjhich has a concave  portion<br>
quadrangular fitting pipe-like portion 4 formed on one end side b^ of the pipe.<br><br>
To connect pipes with such a configuration, the pipe should be cut, such as along line a_. Then, the cut end portion of the pipe body portion a_ can be connected to the portion 4 in the same manner as shown in Figure 7, or the cut end portions can be connected using the joint 10 illustrated in Figures 4 and 5. The structure illustrated in Figures 6 and 7 is advantageous since the pipe body portion can be cut into a desired length at an arbitrary point and easily joined to the next section of pipe.<br><br><br><br>
A third embodiment of the present invention is illustrated in Figures 8 and 9 and differs from the second ■. embodiment by the fitting pipe-like portion 4 formed on one end side b_ (the right side in Figure 8) being cylindrical and a semicircular re-entrant groove 4a being formed along the inner surface of the portion 4. The male side connection portion 5 on a second end c. (e.g., left side in Figure 8) is shaped like a cylinder and a semicircular re-entrant groove 5a is formed in the outer circumferential surface of the portion 5. A circular-section 0-ring 15 is fitted into the groove 5a. The inner circumferential surface  of  the  re-entrant  groove  5a  has  a  diameter<br>
	substantially equal to that of the inner circumferential<br>
	surface of the concave portion 3.<br>
To connect pipes P having the configuration shown in Figures 8 and 9, the circular section 0-ring 15, is<br><br>
fitted into the re-entrant groove 5a in the cylindrical insertion connection portion 5 of a first pipe P. The outer circumferential portion of the 0-ring projects over the outer circumferential surface. The cylindrical insertion connection portion 5 is pressed into the cylindrical fitting pipe-like portion 4 in a second pipe P and the outward projecting portion of the 0-ring 15 fits into the re-entrant groove 4a, to thereby connect the pipes,<br>
Figures 10 and 11 show a modified example of the third embodiment of the present invention, in which the ■ diameter of the outer circumference of the cylindrical-section fitting pipe-shaped portion 4 on the right end side<br>
h_   is substantially equal to that of the outer surface of<br>
	the quadrangular convex portion 2.   The diameter of the<br>
	inner circumference of the cylindrical-section, insertion<br>
	connection portion 5 located on the left end side c_   is<br>
            shaped so as to be inserted in the fitting pipe-like<br><br><br><br>
The outer circumferential surface of the fitting pipe-like" portion 4 is shaped so as not to project over the<br><br>
outer circumference of the pipe body portion a_. This structure allows a plurality of pipes to be aligned, without increasing the size of the connection portion between the pipes and is especially useful when a multi-pipe line is formed. If the inner surface of the insertion connection portion 5 is shaped in the same manner as illustrated in Figures 10 and 11, a cable can be inserted with minimum resistance and effort. As easily understood by the ordinarily skilled artisan within the purview of the present application, the above feature can be applied to the structure of the connection portion in any of the other ■embodiments described herein.<br>
-■4<br><br>
The fitting portion 4 illustrated in Figures 10<br>
and 11 has a flat pipe-shape having an inner circum¬<br>
frenetically surface in which no re-entrant groove 4a is<br>
formed. Depending upon the specific application,<br>
re-entrant grooves 4a and 5a need not always be provided in	two fitting surfaces.  In some applications, a re-entrant<br>
	groove 4a need be formed only in either one of the two<br>
fitting surfaces.   Alternatively, a groove need not be<br>
formed in either surface.  Further, the sealing means is	not limited to the 0-ring 15, but can include other similar<br>
integrally vita the inner surface of the fitting portion 4. Figures 12 and 13 show the structure of a fourth<br><br>
embodiment of the invention, in which the pipe P is cut into a desired length as a concave 'portion 3 to thereby form a structure in which connection is made without a joint. A difference between the fourth embodiment and the previous embodiments is that the fourth embodiment has a cylindrical fitting pipe-like portion 4 with a re-entrant groove 4a which is continuously formed on one end portion b^ and each concave portion 3 in the pipe body portion a. has a cylindrical shape c_ and a re-entrant groove 5a in its outer circumferential surface.<br>
In the fourth embodiment, the cylinder c_  of the<br>
■ concave  portion  3  can  be  used  advantageously  as  an<br>
insertion connection portion for connection to the fitting<br>
pipe-like portion 4.  An arbitrary length portion can be<br>
cut if the length is too large to connect the pipe P for<br>
	the specific application.  The connection method for this<br>
	erabodiment is the same as that of the third embodiment and,<br>
	for brevity, the description thereof will be omitted.<br>
	Figure 14 illustrates a fifth embodiment having<br>
	a pipe structure suitable for close arrangement of a large<br>
number of pipes, such as a multi-pipe line B shown in<br>
Figure 15.  The pipe P is configured so that suitably sized<br>
	projections 6 are formed on the outer circumferential<br>
■	surfaces of two sides 2a (e.g., front side and lower side<br>
in Figure 14) of the convex portions 2 in the pipe P.  The<br><br><br>
size of the projections is advantageously selected by the designer depending on the desired ease of connection (e.g., in which case shorter connections would be employed) and the desired rigidity (e.g., in which case longer connections would be employed) of the pipeline. Cavities 7 which receive the projections 6 are formed on upper side and back side 2b in Figure 14.  Alternatively, in Figure4,	the surfaces where projections 6 and cavities 7 are<br>
formed may be selected to be a combination of the front and<br>
back surfaces or any other logical combination of the upper<br>
and lower surfaces, respectively<br>
The number of cavities 7 and projections 6 will vary depending upon the specific application. When two (or an even number 01) projections 6 or cavities 7 are formed on any one surface as shown in Figure 14, one of the two structures aria be formed as a projection 6 and the other may be formed as a cavity 7.  In short, as shown in Figure<br>
15,	projections and cavities are formed suitably so as to<br>
be fitted together when pipes P are arranged in a bundle.<br>
Depending upon the designer's requirements and<br>
constraints,  projections 6 and cavities 7 need not be<br>
	formed on all sides of a convex portion 2.  For example,<br>
projections 6 and cavities 7 may be formed simply on the<br>
	front and back surfaces, or upper and lower surfaces of the<br>
	convex portion 2, or formed- alternately on the convex<br><br>
portions 2.<br>
To connect the bundled multi-pipe lines B, a rectangular packing 25 is pressed against an end surface oi a multi-pipe line B, as shown in Figures 16 to 18. The rectangular packing 25 has a corresponding number of holes suitably sized to insert the concave portions 3 of the pipes therein to. An annular packing 26 is fitted onto the outer circumferential surface of a convex portion 2 (or a concave portion 3) at a predetermined distance from the end surface of the multi-pipe line B. The end portions of the pipes are pressed into a pipe-like portion 22 of a ..rectangular pipe-like joint 20.<br>
An adhesive hardening liquid 27 is advantageously injected into a space between the two packings 25 and 26 through a small hole 23 formed in the pipe-like portion 22 of the joint, so that the space is filled with the adhesive hardening liquid 27. Such adhesive hardening liquids are well-known and commonly available to ordinarily skilled artisans.  The multi-pipe lines B formed as described above<br>
	are positioned flat against each other.<br>
	The flat portions of two rectangular pipe-like<br>
	flanges 21 opposing each other are tightened and connected<br>
      by using fasteners through the holes 24 formed in the<br>
      flanges 21.  Although description is omitted herein, it ^■■'<br><br>
will be understood by the ordinarily skilled artisan that multi-pipe lines may be connected by any of a variety of other suitable means.<br>
The hardness of a synthetic resin material for forming the pipe used in the present invention may be selected according to a number of considerations such as the size of the pipe to be produced, the area where the pipe will be used, and the like. For an underground pipe, a material having a relatively high hardness and high water resistance is preferably selected, so as to prevent pressure flattening, and taking into account the external . pressure acting on the pipe wall 1.<br>
Although preferred embodiments of the present invention have been described above, it will be understood by the ordinarily skilled artisan that the present invention is not limited to the structure shown in the foregoing embodiments and that changes may be made suitably without departing from the range of embodiments shown so<br>
	long as the objects of the present invention are achieved.<br>
	Thus, the invention can be practiced with modification<br>
,	within the spirit and scope of the appended claims.<br>
	As described above,  according to the present<br><br><br>
Invention, a pipe has a convex-concave shaped corrugated surface with convex portions having a quadrangular cross-sectional shape and concave 'portions having a circular<br><br>
cross-sectional shape.  The pipe according to the present<br>
invention is advantageously shaped to-prevent the pipe from'<br>
undesirable shifting or movement.  Furthermore, the concavo<br>
portions of the inventive pipe allow a wire or cable to be<br>
inserted into the pipe with minimal resistance.<br>
Also, the pipe according to the present invention<br>
is easily formed into multi-pipe lines because the convex<br>
portions are position able flat against one another.  Since<br>
such a multi-pipe line has  little space between the<br>
individual pipes, the multi-pipe line prevents dirt and<br>
sand from accumulating between individual pipes.   This<br>
.feature is particularly useful when pipes are buried<br>
underground,  and helps maintain the parallel,  bundled<br>
configuration of the pipes and minimize disturbance of the<br>
linear and parallel alignment of the lines within the pipe.<br>
Therefore, the pipe according to the present invention is<br>
highly suitable as an underground pipe, and further is<br>
produced economically and without increased cost.<br>
	Additionally, the pipe according to the invention<br>
	has the same strength against being flattened by pressure<br>
	as the conventional pipe, even though the pipe according to<br>
	the present invention is formed only of synthetic resin.<br><br><br>
