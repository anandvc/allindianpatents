NON-AQUEOUS INKJET INKS OF QUINACRIDONE PIGMENTS<br>
Technical Field<br>
[0001]  The present invention relates to non-aqueous Inkjet inks containing specific quinacridone pigments and dispersion synergists.<br>
Background Art<br>
[0002]   Pigment dispersions are made using a dispersant. A dispersant is a<br>
substance for promoting the formation and stabilization of a dispersion of pigment particles in a dispersion medium. Dispersants are generally surface-active materials having an anionic, cationic or non-ionic structure. The presence of a dispersant substantially reduces the dispersing energy required. Dispersed pigment particles may have a tendency to re-agglomerate after the dispersing operation, due to mutual attraction forces. The use of dispersants also counteracts this re-agglomeration tendency of the pigment particles.<br>
[0003]  The dispersant has to meet particularly high requirements when used for Inkjet inks. Inadequate dispersing manifests itself as increased viscosity in liquid systems, loss of brilliance and/or hue shifts. Moreover, particularly good dispersion of the pigment particles is required to ensure unimpeded passage of the pigment particles through the nozzles of the print head in an Inkjet printer, which are usually only a few micrometers in diameter. In addition, pigment particle agglomeration and the associated blockage of the printer nozzles has to be avoided in the standby periods of the printer.<br>
[0004]   Many polymeric dispersants contain in one part of the molecule so-called anchor groups, which adsorb onto the pigments to be dispersed. In a spatially separate part of the molecule, polymeric dispersants have polymer chains sticking out whereby pigment particles are made compatible with the dispersion medium, i.e. stabilized.<br>
[0005]   In aqueous Inkjet inks, the polymeric dispersants generally contain hydrophobic anchor groups exhibiting a high affinity for the pigment surface and hydrophilic polymer chains for stabilizing the pigments in the aqueous dispersion medium.<br><br>
[0006]  The preparation of good thermally stable dispersions with submicron particles is more difficult for non-aqueous Inkjet inks, such as solvent based, oil based and radiation curable Inkjet inks. The pigments are especially difficult to disperse when they have a non-polar surface.<br>
[0007]  These problems have lead to the design of very specific polymeric dispersants wherein the anchor groups are pigment derivatives. For example, EP 0763378 A (TOYO INK) discloses a pigment composition comprising a non-aqueous type pigment dispersing agent having a portion which has a high affinity with a pigment and which has at least one type selected from the group consisting of an organic dye, anthraquinone and acridone only at a terminal end or at both terminal ends of at least one polymer selected from a linear urethane polymer and a linear acrylic polymer, and a pigment.<br>
[0008]  Another approach for dispersing pigments with non-polar surfaces in^ non¬aqueous dispersion media is changing the surface to a more polar surface by addition of compounds known as dispersion synergists. A dispersion synergist is a compound that promotes the adsorption of the polymeric dispersant on the surface of the pigment. It is suggested that the synergist should possess the pigment structure substituted by one or more sulphonic acid groups or salts thereof.<br>
[0009]    US 4461647 (ICI) discloses a dispersion of a pigment in an organic liquid containing a water-insoiuble asymmetric disazo compound comprising a central divalent group free from acidic and other ionic substituents linked through azo groups to two monovalent end groups characterized in that one end group, the first, is free from acidic and other ionic substituents and the other end group, the second, carries a single substituted ammonium-acid salt group.<br>
[0010]    US 4057436 (ICI) discloses pigment dispersions in organic liquids using polymeric or resinous dispersing agents in the presence of a substituted ammonium salt of a colored acid wherein there are between 16 and 60 carbon atoms contained in at least 3 chains attached to the N-atom of the substituted ammonium ion.<br><br>
[0011]    us 6641655 (AVECIA) discloses the use of a diquaternary ammonium salt of a coloured acid as fluidising agent wherein the diquaternary ammonium cation contains two or more nitrogen atoms.<br>
[0012]  Although these dispersion synergists work fine for some pigments, many other pigments can not be dispersed to an acceptable quality in a non¬aqueous medium. This is the case for quinacridone pigments, for which it is difficult to obtain stable non-aqueous Inkjet inks.<br>
[0013] Sulfonated quinacridone derivatives have been disclosed, for example, by US 6152968 (BASF) . However, US 6152968 (BASF) is silent on their use in non-aqueous media.<br>
[0014]    US 6827775 (CIBA SPECIALTY CHEMICALS) discloses the use of a pigment and its sulfonation product in a solid solution, water and organic solvents such as xylene. However, US 6827775 (CIBA SPECIALTY CHEMICALS) is silent on the stability of non-aqueous dispersions of. quinacridone type pigments and their sulfonation products.<br>
[0015]    US 4844742 (CIBA GEIGY) discloses the surface modification of<br>
quinacridone pigments, wherein the pigment is treated with a solvent-free, basic, nitrogen-containing copolymer of the polyurethane series and with a dispersion-improving quinacridone derivative resulting in compositions exhibiting enhanced performance in automotive and other finish systems. The derivatives used are phthalimidomethyl or sulfonic acid derivatives of quinacridone. Again no details are given on the stability of non-aqueous dispersions of quinacridone type pigments.<br>
[0016]   WO 02/064680 (CLARIANT) discloses quinacridone derivatives<br>
comprising sulfonic acid and carboxylic acid groups used as pigment dispersants in aqueous and non-aqueous Inkjet inks and in hotmelt Inkjet inks. Radiation curable Inkjet inks are not disclosed.<br>
[0017]    DE 1619618 (DU PONT) discloses quinacridone pigments comprising up to 25 wt% of quinacridone derivatives comprising carboxylic acid groups. Pigment dispersions using the quinacridone derivatives are not disclosed.<br>
[0018]    US 20050196697 (KONICA MINOLTA) discloses actinic ray curable compositions containing a quinacndone pigment; a dispersant; a cationically polymerizable monomer; a photo acid generator; and a<br><br>
quinacridone derivative. The exemplified quinacridone derivatives<br>
comprise suifonamido groups. [0019]    US 6451103 (TOYO INK) discloses self-dispersible aqueous pigment<br>
dispersions of quinacridone pigments with water-soluble pigment<br>
derivatives comprising one or more groups having a carboxylic acid or<br>
sulfonic acid or salts thereof. Non-aqueous pigment dispersions are not<br>
disclosed. [0020]   For consistent image quality, Inkjet inks require a dispersion stability<br>
capable of dealing with high temperatures (above 60°C) during transport<br>
of the ink to a customer, jetting at elevated temperatures and changes in<br>
the dispersion medium of the Inkjet ink during use, for example,<br>
evaporation of solvent and increasing concentrations of humectants,<br>
penetrants and other additives.<br>
[0021]   Dimethyl substituted quinacridone pigments such as C.I. Pigment Red-122	-<br>
has been a preferred quinacridone pigment for making inkjet ink sets with<br>
high colour gamut, however this quinacridone pigment exhibits poor<br>
dispersion quality and stability in comparison to, for example, an<br>
unsubstituted quinacridone pigments. [0022]  Therefore, it is highly desirable to be able to manufacture inkjet inks using<br>
a dimethyl substituted quinacridone pigment in a non-aqueous medium<br>
exhibiting high dispersion quality and stability. Disclosure of Invention Objects of the invention [0023]   It is an object of the present invention to provide a non-aqueous inkjet ink<br>
comprising a dimethyl substituted quinacridone pigment with high<br>
dispersion quality and stability. [0024]   It is a further object of the present invention to produce images of high<br>
image quality with a high optical density using a,non-aqueous inkjet ink<br>
comprising a dimethyl substituted quinacridone pigment. [0025]   Further objects of the invention will become apparent from the description<br>
hereinafter. Summary of the invention<br><br>
[0026]   It has been surprisingly found that non-aqueous inkjet inks comprising a dimethyl substituted quinacridone pigment of high dispersion quality and stability were obtained by using the quinacridone pigment C.I. Pigment Red 282 and a quinacridone derivative containing at least one acid group as dispersion synergist.<br>
[0027]  Objects of the present invention have been realized with a non-aqueous inkjet ink comprising a quinacridone pigment and a dispersion synergist characterized in that the quinacridone pigment is a mixed crystal comprising a dimethyl substituted quinacridone and a monomethyl substituted quinacridone and the dispersion synergist comprises at least one acid group.<br>
[0028]  These and other objects of the invention will become apparent from the description hereinafter.<br>

Non-aqueous Inkjet inks<br>
[0035]  The non-aqueous Inkjet Ink according to the present Invention contains at least a quinacridone mixed crystal comprising a dimethyl substituted quinacridone and a monomethyl substituted quinacridone and a dispersion synergist comprising at least one acid group.The components are present in a dispersion medium which is a non-aqueous liquid at jetting temperature.<br>
[0036]  The dispersant used in the non-aqueous Inkjet ink according to the present invention is preferably a polymeric dispersant.<br>
[0037]  The term "non-aqueous liquid" refers to a liquid carrier which should<br>
contain no water. However sometimes a small amount, generally less than 5 wt% of water based on the total weight of the ink, can be present. This water was not intentionally added but came into the formulation via other components as a contamination, such as for example polar organic solvents. Higher amounts of water than 5 wt% tend to make the non-aqueous Inkjet inks instable, preferably the water content is less than 1 wt% based on the total weight dispersion medium and most preferably no water at all is present.<br>
[0038]  The non-aqueous Inkjet Ink according to the present invention may further also contain at least one surfactant.<br>
[0039]  The non-aqueous Inkjet ink according to the present invention may contain at least one humectant to prevent the clogging of the nozzle, due to its ability to slow down the evaporation rate of ink.<br>
[0040]  The non-aqueous Inkjet Ink according to the present Invention is preferably an Inkjet ink selected from the group consisting of an organic solvent based, an oil based and a curable Inkjet Ink. The curable Inkjet ink is preferably radiation curable.<br>
[0041]   The viscosity of the Inkjet ink is preferably smaller than 100 mPa.s at<br>
30°C. The viscosity of the Inkjet ink is preferably smaller than 30  mPa.s, more preferably lower than 15 mPa.s, and most preferably between 2 and<br><br>
10 mPa.s at a shear rate of 100 s-1' and a jetting temperature between 10 and 70°C.<br>
[0042]   The curable Inkjet ink may contain as dispersion medium monomers, oligomers and/or prepolymers possessing different degrees of functionality. A mixture including combinations of mono-, di-, tri- and/or higher functionality monomers, oligomers or prepolymers may be used. A catalyst called an initiator for initiating the polymerization reaction may be included in the curable Inkjet ink. The initiator can be a thermal initiator, but is preferably a photo-initiator. The photo-initiator requires less energy to activate than the monomers, oligomers and/or prepolymers to form the polymer. The photo-initiator suitable for use in the curable pigment dispersion may be a Norrish type I initiator, a Norrish type II initiator or a photo-acid generator.<br>
[0043} The non-aqueous Inkjet ink according to the present invention was<br>
particular suitable as a magenta Inkjet ink in a non-aqueous CMYK Inkjet ink set comprising a yellow non-aqueous Inkjet ink having a yellow pigment selected from the group consisting of C.l. Pigment Yellow 120, C.I. Pigment Yellow 139, C.l. Pigment Yellow 150, C.l. Pigment Yellow 151, C.l. Pigment Yellow 15, C.l. Pigment Yellow 180 and C.l. Pigment Yellow 213; a cyan non-aqueous Inkjet ink comprising a copper phthalocyanine pigment and a black non-aqueous Inkjet ink comprising carbon black.<br>
[0044]  The non-aqueous Inkjet ink CMYK Inkjet ink set may also be extended with extra inks such as red, green, blue, and/or orange to further enlarge the colour gamut of the image. The CMYK ink set may also be extended by the combination of full density and light density inks of both colour inks and/or black inks to improve the image quality by lowered graininess.<br>
Quinacridone pigments<br>
[0045]  The quinacridone pigment in the non-aqueous Inkjet ink according to the present invention is a mixed crystal. Mixed crystals are also referred to as solid solutions. Under certain conditions different quinacridones mix with each other to form solid solutions, which are quite different from both physical mixtures of the compounds and from the compounds themselves.<br><br>
In a solid solution, the molecules of the components enter into the same crystal lattice, usually, but not always, that of one of the components. The x-ray diffraction pattern of the resulting crystalline solid is characteristic of that solid and can be clearly differentiated from the pattern of a physical mixture of the same components in the same proportion. In such physical mixtures, the x-ray pattern of each of the components can be distinguished, and the disappearance of many of these lines is one of the criteria of the formation of solid solutions.<br>
[0046]   The mixed crystal suitable for the Inkjet ink according to present invention comprises a dimethyl substituted quinacridone and a monomethyl substituted quinacridone. The mixed crystal may further comprise minor amounts of one or more other quinachdones, such as, for example, an unsubstituted quinacridone, a dichloro substituted quinacridone and/or a quinacridone having only one chlorogroup.<br>
[0047]   In a preferred embodiment the dimethyl substituted quinacridone in the mixed crystal is represented by C.I. Pigment Red 122. Preferably the monomethyl substituted quinacridone in the mixed crystal is represented by C.I. Pigment Red 192.<br>
[0048]   In a more preferred embodiment the mixed crystal contains C.I. Pigment Red 122 in an amount between 40 and 75 wt% based upon the total weight of the pigment. Preferably the mixed crystal contains C.I. Pigment Red 192 in an amount of at least 25 wt% based upon the total weight of the pigment<br>
[0049]  A preferred mixed crystal comprising a dimethyl substituted quinacridone and a monomethyl substituted quinacridone is C.I. Pigment Red 282. A commercially available C.I. Pigment Red 282 is IRGAZIN™ MAGENTA 2012.<br>
[0050]  The amount of monomethyl substituted quinacridone in a mixed crystal can be easily determined by techniques such as Probe-MS or Liquid Chromatography coupled with Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS).<br>
[0051] In a preferred embodiment the dimethyl substituted quinacridone and monomethyl substituted quinacridone should be present in the mixed crystal in a major amount, preferably their sum should make up at least 70<br><br>
wt%, more preferably at least 80 wt% and most preferably 90 to 100 wt% of the total weight of the mixed crystal. Preferably at least 50 wt% of the mixed crystal is dimethyl substituted quinacridone.<br>
[0052]   Pigment particles in Inkjet ink should be sufficiently small to permit free flow of the ink through the inkjet-printing device, especially at the ejecting nozzles. It is also desirable to use small particles for maximum colour strength and to slow down sedimentation.<br>
[0053]  The numeric average pigment particle size is preferably between 0.050 and 1 |jm, more preferably between 0.070 and 0.300 μm and particularly preferably between 0.080 and 0.200 μm. Most preferably, the numeric average pigment particle size is no larger than 0.150 μm.<br>
[0054]   The pigment is preferably used in the Inkjet ink in an amount of 0.1 to 20 wt%, preferably 1 to 10 wt% based on the total weight of the Inkjet ink.<br>
Dispersion synergists<br>
[0055]  A dispersion synergist is a compound used for improving the dispersion<br>
quality and stability of Inkjet inks. A mixture of dispersion synergists can be used to further improve dispersion stability.<br>
[0056]  The dispersion synergist in the non-aqueous Inkjet ink according to the present invention comprises at least one acid group. In a preferred embodiment the at least one acid group is a carboxylic acid group.<br>
[0057]   In a preferred embodiment the dispersion synergist is a quinacridone<br>
derivative substituted on one of the two nitrogen atoms of the quinacridone basic chromophore structure with at least one carboxylic acid group. The pigment C.I. Pigment Violet 19 represents the quinacridone basic chromophore structure.<br>
[0058] The at least one acid group may be an alkanoic acid group, an alicyclic acid group, a heterocyclic acid group, a hetero-aromatic acid group, an aromatic acid group.<br>
[0059]  The aromatic acid group is preferably a benzoic acid group.<br>
[0060]   The dispersion synergist may contain two or more acid groups, preferably in meta- or para-position on a phenyl ring. A preferred aromatic acid group containing two carboxylic acid groups is a phthalic acid group. Preferably the phthalic acid group is an isophthalic group.<br><br>
[0061]  A combination of different types of acid groups may also be<br>
advantageously used. For example, a combination of a carboxylic acid group and a sulphonic acid or a phosphoric acid can be used.<br>
[0062]  The at least one acid group may be attached directly to the quinacridone structure or may be attached through a linking group containing 1 or more carbon atoms. The linking group contains preferably 1 to 20 carbon atoms, more preferably 1 to 12 and most preferably 1 to 6 carbon atoms. In a preferred embodiment the linking group is a straight chain of 1 or more carbon atoms, wherein some of the carbon atoms and/or hydrogen atoms may be substituted by a heteroatom.<br>
[0063]  The dispersion synergist is preferably a quinacridone derivative according to formula (A) <br>
wherein R1 and R2 are each independently selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, methyl, ethyl and halogen; and R3 represents the at least one acid group. [0064]   In a preferred embodiment the dispersion synergist is a quinacridone derivative represented by Formula (I):<br><br><br>
wherein R1 and R2 are each independently selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, methyl, ethyl and halogen. [0065]   In a more preferred embodiment the quinacridone derivative is represented by Formula (II):<br><br>
wherein R1 and R2 are each independently selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, methyl, ethyl and halogen. [0066]   The most preferred quinacridone derivative is:<br><br>
[0067]  Another preferred quinacridone derivative is the quinacridone derivative<br>
according to Formula (II) wherein R1 and R2 are both hydrogen. [0068]  Another preferred quinacridone derivative is the quinacridone derivative<br>
according to Formula (II) wherein R1 and R2 are both a methyl group. [0069]  A mixture of the quinacridone derivatives according to Formula (I) and one<br>
or more other dispersion synergists may also be used to obtain better<br>
dispersion quality and stability.<br><br>
[0070]  The dispersion synergist is preferably added in an amount between 0.1<br>
and 20wt% based upon the weight of the pigment. [0071]  The synergist should be additional to the amount of polymeric<br>
dispersant(s). The ratio of polymeric dispersant/disperslon synergist depends upon the pigment and should be determined experimentally. Typically the ratio wt% polymeric dispersant/wt% dispersion synergist is selected between 2:1 to 100:1, preferably between 2:1 and 20:1. Dispersants<br>
[0072]  Typical polymeric dispersants are copolymers of two monomers but may<br>
contain three, four, five or even more monomers. The properties of<br>
polymeric dispersants depend on both the nature of the monomers and<br>
their distribution in the polymer. Suitable copolymeric dispersants have the<br>
following polymer compositions:<br>
    statistically polymerized monomers (e.g. monomers A and B	-<br>
polymerized into ABBAABAB);<br>
alternating polymerized monomers (e.g. monomers A and B<br>
polymerized into ABABABAB);<br>
gradient (tapered) polymerized monomers (e.g. monomers A and B<br>
polymerized into AAABAABBABBB);<br>
block copolymers (e.g. monomers A and B polymerized into<br>
AAAAABBBBBB) wherein the block length of each of the blocks (2, 3,<br>
4, 5 or even more) is important for the dispersion capability of the<br>
polymeric dispersant;<br>
graft copolymers (graft copolymers consist of a polymeric backbone<br>
with side chains attached to the backbone); and<br>
mixed forms of these polymers, e.g. blocky gradient copolymers. [0073]  Polymeric dispersants may have different polymer architecture including linear, comb/branched, star, dendritic (including dendrimers and hyperbranched polymers). A general review on the architecture of polymers is given by ODIAN, George, Principles Of Polymerization, 4th edition, Wiley-lnterscience, 2004, p. 1-18.<br><br>
[0074]   Comb/branched polymers have side branches of linked monomer<br>
molecules protruding from various centra! branch points along the main polymer chain (at least 3 branch points). [0075]  Star polymers are branched polymers in which three or more either similar or different linear homopolymers or copolymers are linked together to a single core. [0076]   Dendritic polymers comprise the classes of dendrimers and<br>
hyperbranched polymers. In dendrimers, with well-defined mono-disperse structures, all branch points are used (multi-step synthesis), while hyperbranched polymers have a plurality of branch points and multifunctional branches that lead to further branching with polymer growth (one-step polymerization process). [0077]   Suitable polymeric dispersants may be prepared via addition or<br>
condensation type polymerizations. Polymerization methods include those-described by ODIAN, George, Principles Of Polymerization, 4th edition, Wiley-lnterscience, 2004, p. 39-606. [0078]  Addition polymerization methods include free radical polymerization (FRP) and controlled polymerization techniques. Suitable controlled radical polymerization methods include:<br>
RAFT: reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer; ATRP: atom transfer radical polymerization<br>

[0148]  If the non-aqueous pigment dispersion is a curable pigment dispersion, the dispersion medium comprises one or more monomers and/or oligomers to obtain a liquid dispersion medium. Sometimes, it can be advantageous to add a small amount of an organic solvent to improve the dissolution of the dispersant. The content of organic solvent should be lower than 20 wt% based on the total weight of the Inkjet ink. In other cases, it can be advantageous to add a small amount of water, for example, to improve the spreading of the Inkjet ink on a hydrophilic surface, but preferably the inkjet ink contains no water.<br>
[0149]   Preferred organic solvents include alcohols, aromatic hydrocarbons, ketones, esters, aliphatic hydrocarbons, higher fatty acids, carbitols, cellosolves, higher fatty acid esters. Suitable alcohols include methanol, ethanol, propanol and 1-butanol, 1-pentanol, 2-butanol, t.-butanol. Suitable aromatic hydrocarbons include toluene, and xylene.

[0150]   In the case of a curable inkjet ink, the dispersion medium preferably consists of monomers and/or oligomers.<br>
Monomers and oligomers<br>
[0151]  Any monomer or oligomer may be used as curable compound for the curable inkjet ink. A combination of monomers, oligomers and/or prepolymers may also be used. The monomers, oligomers and/or prepolymers may possess different degrees of functionality, and a mixture including combinations of mono-, di-, tri-and higher functionality<br><br>
monomers, oligomers and/or prepolymers may be used. The viscosity of the Inkjet Ink can be adjusted by varying the ratio between the monomers and oligomers.<br>
[0152]  Any method of conventional radical polymerization, photo-curing system using photo acid or photo base generator, or photo induction alternating copolymerization may be employed. In general, radical polymerization and cationic polymerization are preferred, and photo induction alternating copolymerization needing no initiator may also be employed. Furthermore, a hybrid system of combinations of these systems is also effective.<br>
[0153]   Cationic polymerization is superior in effectiveness due to lack of inhibition of the polymerization by oxygen, however it is expensive and slow, especially under conditions of high relative humidity. If cationic polymerization is used, it is preferred to use an epoxy compound together with an oxetane compound to increase the rate of polymerization. Radical polymerization is the preferred polymerization process.<br>
[0154]  Any polymerizable compound commonly known in the art may be<br>

[0175]  A preferred class of monomers and oligomers which can be used in both radiation and cationically curable compositions are vinyl ether acrylates such as those described in US 6310115 (AGFA) .incorporated herein-by reference. Particularly preferred compounds are 2- (2-vinyloxyethoxy)ethyl (meth)acrylate, most preferably the compound is 2- (2-vinyloxyethoxy)ethyl acrylate.<br>
Initiators<br>
[0176]  The curable Inkjet ink preferably also contains an initiator. The initiator<br>
typically initiates the polymerization reaction. The initiator can be a thermal initiator, but is preferably a photo-initiator. The photo-initiator requires less energy to activate than the monomers, oligomers and/or prepolymers to form the polymer. The photo-initiator suitable for use in the curable Inkjet inks may be a Norrish type I initiator, a Norrish type II initiator or a photo-acid generator.<br>

[0178]  The photo-initiator or photo-initiator system absorbs light and is<br>
responsible for the production of initiating species, such as free radicals and cations. Free radicals and cations are high-energy species that induce polymerization of monomers, oligomers and polymers and with polyfunctional monomers and oligomers thereby also inducing cross-linking.<br>
[0179]   Irradiation with actinic radiation may be realized in two steps by changing wavelength or intensity. In such cases it is preferred to use 2 types of photo-initiator together.<br>
10180]  A combination of different types of initiator, for example, a photo-initiator and a thermal initiator can also be used.<br>

[0186]   Suitable cationic photo-initiators include compounds, which form aprotic acids or Bronstead acids upon exposure to ultraviolet and/or visible light sufficient to initiate polymerization. The photo-initiator used may be a single compound, a mixture of two or more active compounds, or a combination of two or more different compounds, i.e. co-initiators. Non-limiting examples of suitable cationic photo-initiators are aryldiazonium salts, diaryliodonium salts, triarylsulphonium salts, triarylselenonium salts and the like.<br>
[0187]  The curable Inkjet ink may contain a photo-initiator system containing one or more photo-initiators and one or more sensitizers that transfer energy to the photo-initiator(s). Suitable sensitizers include photoreducible xanthene, fluorene, benzoxanthene, benzothioxanthene, thiazine, oxazine, coumarin, pyronine, porphyrin, acridine, azo, diazo, cyanine, merocyanine, diarylmethyl, triarylmethyl, anthraquinone, phenylenediamine, benzimidazole, fluorochrome, quinoline, tetrazole, naphthol, benzidine, rhodamine, indigo and/or indanthrene dyes. The amount of the sensitizer is in general from 0.01 to 15 wt%, preferably from 0.05 to 5 wt%, based in each case on the total weight of the curable Inkjet ink.<br><br>
[0188]   In Order to increase the photosensitivity further, the curable Inkjet ink may additionally contain co-initiators. For example, the combination of titanocenes and trichloromethyl-s-triazines, of titanocenes and ketoxime ethers and of acridines and trichloromethyl-s-triazines is known. A further increase in sensitivity can be achieved by adding dibenzalacetone or amino acid derivatives. The amount of co-initiator or co-initiators is in general from 0.01 to 20 wt%, preferably from 0.05 to 10 wt%, based in each case on the total weight of the curable Inkjet ink.<br>
[0189]   A preferred initiator system is 2,2'-bis(o-chlorophenyl)-4,4',5,5'-tetraphenyl-(7CI,8Ci) 4,4'-Bi-4H-imidazole corresponding to the chemical formula:<br><br>
in the presence of a co-initiator such as 2-mercapto benzoxazole. [0190]  Another preferred type of initiator is an oxime ester. A suitable example has as chemical formula:<br><br>
[0191]  A preferred amount of initiator is 0.3 - 50 wt% of the total weight of the<br>
curable liquid, and more preferably 1 -15 wt% of the total weight of the<br>
curable Inkjet ink. [0192]   Irradiation with actinic radiation may be realized in two steps by changing<br>
wavelength or intensity. In such cases it is preferred to use 2 types of<br>
photo-initiator together. Inhibitors<br><br>
[0193]   The radiation curable inkjet ink may contain a polymerization inhibitor. Suitable polymerization inhibitors include phenol type antioxidants, hindered amine light stabilizers, phosphor type antioxidants, hydroquinone monomethyl ether commonly used in (meth)acrylate monomers, and hydroquinone, t-butylcatechol, pyrogallol may also be used.<br>
[0194]  Suitable commercial inhibitors are, for example, Sumilizer™ GA-80,<br>

[0195]   Since excessive addition of these polymerization inhibitors will lower the ink sensitivity to curing, it is preferred that the amount capable of preventing polymerization is determined prior to blending. The amount of a polymerization inhibitor is preferably lower than 2 wt% of the total ink.<br>
Binders<br>
[0196]   Non-aqueous inkjet ink compositions preferably comprise a binder resin. The binder functions as a viscosity controlling agent and also provides fixability relative to the polymeric resin substrate, e.g. a polyvinyl chloride substrate, also called vinyl substrate. The binder must be selected to have a good solubility in the solvent(s).<br>
[0197]   Suitable examples of binder resins include acrylic resins, modified acrylic resins, styrene acrylic resins, acrylic copolymers, acryiate resins, aldehyde resins, rosins, rosin esters, modified rosins and modified rosin resins, acetyl polymers, acetal resins such as polyvinyl butyral, ketone resins, phenolic resins and modified phenolic resins, maleic resins and modified maleic resins, terpene resins, polyester resins, polyamide resins, polyurethane resins, epoxy resins, vinyl resins, vinyl chloride-vinyl acetate copolymer resins, cellulose type resins such as nitro cellulose, cellulose acetopropionate and cellulose acetate butyrate, and vinyl toluene-a-methylstylene copolymer resin. These binders may be used alone or in a mixture thereof. The binder is preferably a film-forming thermoplastic resin.<br><br>
[0198] The amount of binder resin in inkjet ink is preferably in the range of 0.1 to 30 wt%, more preferably 1 to 20 wt%, most preferably 2 to 10 wt% based on the total weight of the Inkjet ink.<br>
Surfactants<br>
[0199]  The Inkjet ink may contain at least one surfactant. The surfactant(s) can be anionic, cationic, non-ionic, or zwitter-ionic and are usually added in a total quantity less than 20 wt% based on the total weight of the Inkjet ink and particularly in a total less than 10 wt% based on the total weight of the Inkjet ink.<br>
[0200]   Suitable surfactants include fluorinated surfactants, fatty acid salts, ester salts of a higher alcohol, alkylbenzene sulphonate salts, sulphosuccinate ester salts and phosphate ester salts of a higher alcohol (for example, sodium dodecylbenzenesulphonate and sodium dioctylsulphosuccinate), ethylene oxide.adducts of a higher alcohol, ethylene oxide adducts of an  alkylphenol, ethylene oxide adducts of a polyhydric alcohol fatty acid ester, and acetylene glycol and ethylene oxide adducts thereof (for example, polyoxyethylene nonylphenyl ether, and SURFYNOL™ 104, 104H, 440, 465 and TG available from AIR PRODUCTS &amp; CHEMICALS INC.).<br>
[0201]  For non-aqueous Inkjet inks preferred surfactants are selected from fluoro surfactants (such as fluorinated hydrocarbons) and silicone surfactants. The silicones are typically siloxanes and can be alkoxylated, polyether modified, polyether modified hydroxy functional, amine modified, epoxy modified and other modifications or combinations thereof. Preferred siloxanes are polymeric, for example polydimethyisiloxanes.<br>
[0202]   In a curable Inkjet ink a fluorinated or silicone compound may be used as a surfactant, preferably a cross-linkable surfactant is used. Polymerizable monomers having surface-active effects include silicone modified acrylates, silicone modified methacryiates, acrylated siloxanes, polyether modified acrylic modified siloxanes, fluorinated acrylates, and fluorinated methacryiates. Polymerizable monomers having surface-active effects can be mono-, di-, tri- or higher functional (meth)acrylates or mixtures thereof.<br>
Humectants/Penetrants<br><br>
[0203]  Suitable humectants include triacetin, N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone, glycerol, urea, thiourea, ethylene urea, alkyl urea, alkyl thiourea, dialkyi urea and dialkyi thiourea, diols, including ethanediols, propanediols, propanetriols, butanediols, pentanediols, and hexanediols; glycols, including propylene glycol, polypropylene glycol, ethylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, tetraethylene glycol, and mixtures and derivatives thereof. Preferred humectants are triethylene glycol mono butylether, glycerol and 1,2-hexanediol. The humectant is preferably added to the Inkjet ink formulation in an amount of 0.1 to 40 wt% of the formulation, more preferably 0.1 to 10 wt% of the formulation, and most preferably approximately 4.0 to 6.0 wt%.<br>
Preparation of Inkjet inks<br>
[0204]   The Inkjet ink may be prepared by precipitating or milling the pigment in theHdispersionmediurn in the presence of the dispersant.<br>
[0205]   Mixing apparatuses may include a pressure kneader, an open kneader, a planetary mixer, a dissolver, and a Dalton Universal Mixer. Suitable milling and dispersion apparatuses are a ball mill, a pearl mill, a colloid mill, a high-speed disperser, double rollers, a bead mill, a paint conditioner, and triple rollers. The dispersions may also be prepared using ultrasonic energy.<br>
[0206]   Many different types of materials may be used as milling media, such as glasses, ceramics, metals, and plastics. In a preferred embodiment, the grinding media can comprise particles, preferably substantially spherical in shape, e.g. beads consisting essentially of a polymeric resin or yttrium stabilized zirconium oxide beads.<br>
[0207]   In the process of mixing, milling and dispersion, each process is performed with cooling to prevent build up of heat, and for radiation curable Inkjet inks as much as possible under light conditions in which actinic radiation has been substantially excluded.<br>
[0208]  The inkjet ink may contain more than one pigment, the Inkjet ink may be prepared using separate dispersions for each pigment, or alternatively several pigments may be mixed and co-milled in preparing the dispersion.<br><br>
[0209]   The dispersion process can be carried out in a continuous, batch or semi-batch mode.<br>
[0210]  The preferred amounts and ratios of the ingredients of the mill grind will vary widely depending upon the specific materials and the intended applications. The contents of the milling mixture comprise the mill grind and the milling media. The mill grind comprises pigment, polymeric dispersant and a liquid carrier. For Inkjet inks, the pigment is usually present in the mill grind at 1 to 50 wt%, excluding the milling media. The weight ratio of pigment over polymeric dispersant is 20:1 to 1:2.<br>
[0211]   The milling time can vary widely and depends upon the pigment,<br>
mechanical means and residence conditions selected, the initial and desired final particle size, etc. In the present invention pigment dispersions with an average particle size of less than 100 nm may be prepared.<br>
[0212]  After milling is completed, the milling media is separated from the milled particulate product (in either a dry or liquid dispersion form) using conventional separation techniques, such as by filtration, sieving through a mesh screen, and the like. Often the sieve is built into the mill, e.g. for a bead mill. The milled pigment concentrate is preferably separated from the milling media by filtration.<br>
[0213]   In general it is desirable to make the Inkjet inks in the form of a<br>
concentrated mill grind, which is subsequently diluted to the appropriate concentration for use in the Inkjet printing system. This technique permits preparation of a greater quantity of pigmented ink from the equipment. By dilution, the Inkjet ink is adjusted to the desired viscosity, surface tension, colour, hue, saturation density, and print area coverage for the particular application.<br>
Spectral Separation Factor<br>
[0214]  The spectral separation factor SSF was found to be an excellent measure, to characterize a pigmented Inkjet ink, as it takes into account properties related to light-absorption (e.g. wavelength of maximum absorbance λmax, shape of the absorption spectrum and absorbance-value at λmax) as well as properties related to the dispersion quality and stability.<br><br>
[0215]  A measurement of the absorbance at a higher wavelength gives an<br>
indication on the shape of the absorption spectrum. The dispersion quality can be evaluated based on the phenomenon of light scattering induced by solid particles in solutions. When measured in transmission, light scattering in pigment inks may be detected as an increased absorbance at higher wavelengths than the absorbance peak of the actual pigment. The dispersion stability can be evaluated by comparing the SSF before and after a heat treatment of e.g. a week at 80°C.<br>
[0216]  The spectral separation factor SSF of the ink is calculated by using the data of the recorded spectrum of an ink solution or a jetted image on a substrate and comparing the maximum absorbance to the absorbance at a higher reference wavelength λref The spectral separation factor is calculated as the ratio of the maximum absorbance Amax over the absorbance'λref at a reference wavelength.<br><br>
[0217]  The SSF is an excellent tool to design Inkjet ink sets with large colour<br>
gamut. Often Inkjet ink sets are now commercialized, wherein the different inks are not sufficiently matched with each other. For example, the combined absorption of all inks does not give a complete absorption over the whole visible spectrum, e.g. "gaps" exist between the absorption spectra of the colorants. Another problem is that one ink might be absorbing in the range of another ink. The resulting colour gamut of these Inkjet ink sets is low or mediocre.<br>

Measurement methods<br>
1. Measurement of SSF<br>
[0219]  The spectral separation factor SSF of the ink was calculated by using the data of the recorded spectrum of an ink solution and comparing the maximum absorbance to the absorbance at a reference wavelength. The reference wavelength chosen for a magenta Inkjet ink was 650 nm.<br>
[0220]  The absorbance was determined in transmission with a Shimadzu<br>
UV-2101 PC double beam-spectrophotometer. The ink was diluted with ethyl acetate to have a pigment concentration of 0.005%. A spectrophotometric measurement of the UV-VIS-NIR absorption spectrum of the diluted ink was performed in transmission-mode with a double beam-spectrophotometer using the settings of Table 1. Quartz cells with a path length of 10 mm were used and ethyl acetate was chosen as a blank.<br><br><br><br>
[0221]   Efficient inkjet inks exhibiting a narrow absorption spectrum and a higin nnaximum absorbance have a value for SSF of at least 30.<br>
2.	Dispersion stability<br>
[0222]  The dispersion stability was evaluated by comparing the SSF before and after a heat treatment of one week at 80°C. Inkjet inks exhibiting good dispersion stability have a SSF after heat treatment still larger than 30 and a loss in SSF of less than 35%.<br>
3.	Average particle size<br>
[0223] The average particle size of pigment particles in Inkjet Ink was determined with a Brookhaven Instruments Particle Sizer BI90plus based upon the principle of dynamic light scattering. The ink or dispersion was diluted with ethyl acetate to a pigment concentration of 0.002 wt%. The measurement settings of the BIQOplus were: 5 runs at 23°C, angle of 90°, wavelength of 635 nm and graphics = correction function.<br>
[0224]   For good Inkjet characteristics Getting characteristics and print quality) the average particle size of the dispersed particles is below about 200 nm, preferably about 100 nm. The Inkjet ink is considered to be a stable pigment dispersion if the particle size remains below about 200 nm after heat treatment of 7 days at 80°C.<br>
4.	LC-MS<br>
[0225]   First a sample was prepared by dissolving 0.5 mg of pigment in 20 mL of dimethylsulfoxide using ultrasonic treatment followed by filtration. 5 |JL of the sample was then injected on an YMC AQ analytical column from YMC Inc. of 50 mm length and 2 mm diameter containing 3 pm particles mounted in a HP1100 Esquire-LC from HEWLETT-PACKARD. A gradient elution was performed at 0.2 mL/min. and 40°C by starting with eluent A (9.i mixture of watermethanol containing 10 mmol ammonium acetate) and gradually replacing it by eluent B (methanol containing 10 mmol ammonium acetate) according to Table 2:<br><br><br><br>

38.1 g (0.1 mol) of dried pigment PR202 in 130 gram dimethylsulfoxide was dissolved by the addition of 23 g (0.205 mol) potassium tert-butoxide. The blue-green solution was heated to about 110°C for 1 hour. Then the mixture was cooled till 40°C, and 25.5 g (0.105 mol) of compound QA-2 was added. The alkylation-step was done after 4 hours. The product was hydrolyzed by the addition of 400 ml of water and 19.5 gram Potassium hydroxide 86% (0.3 mol) after 4 hours heating at 60°C. Then 75 ml concentrated hydrochloric acid (0.9 mol) was added to the mixture. The dispersion synergist QAD-3 was filtered and washed with water. The yield was 100%. [0234]  Synthesis of dimethyl-(5-chloromethyl)isophthalate (QA-2) was accomplished according to the following synthesis scheme:<br><br><br>
22.4 g (0.1 mol) of dimethyl-(5-hydroxymethyl)isophthalate (QAOH-2) was dissolved in a mixture of 100 mL of Toluene and 0.2 g dimethylacetamide (catalyst).  15.4 g (0.13 mol) of thionylchloride was added drop wise and the mixture was stirred during 4 hour at 40°C. After this period, the mixture was cooled in an ice bath and 50 mL of methanol was added. This solid product QA-2 was filtered and washed with a small volume of methanol. The yield was 58%. [0235]  Synthesis of dimethyl-(5-hydroxymethyl)isophthalate QAOH-2 was accomplished according to the following synthesis scheme:<br><br>
25.2 g (0.1 mol) of trimethyl 1,3,5 benzenetricarboxylate was dissolved in 85 mL of methyl acetate at 50°C. 40.5 ml (0.08 mol) lithiumborohydride 2.0 M in THF was added drop wise and the mixture was stirred during 3 hour at 50°C. After this period 5.3 gram acetic acid (0.088 mol) and 3 mL water were added. The methyl acetate and THF were evaporated, 50 ml water and 50 ml n-hexane were added. The product QAOH-2 was filtered and washed with a small volume water and n-hexane. The yield was 63%. Synthesis of comparative dispersion synergist SYN-1<br><br>
[0236]  The compound SYN-1 having a quinacridone structure but a sulfonic acid salt group was used as a comparative dispersion synergist.<br><br>

The magenta suspension was dissolved by addition of 22.44 g (0.2 mol) of potassium tert-butoxide.13.6 g (0.1 mol) of 1,4-butanesultone and 1.7 g (0.01 mol) of potassium iodide are added to the blue solution and the mixture was heated during 4 hours. After cooling down the dispersion synergist SYN-1 was precipitated by adding 210 mL of methanol. The synergist was filtered and washed with methanol. The yield was 60%.<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
[0238]  This example illustrates that non-aqueous Inkjet Inks improved for dispersion stability can be prepared from quinacridone pigments<br><br>
comprising monomethyl quinacridone in the presence of a dispersion<br>
synergist comprising at least one acid group. Preparation and evaluation of inkjet inks [0239]  All inkjet inks were prepared in the same manner to obtain a composition<br>
as described in Table 3 , except that different pigments and dispersion<br>
synergists were used. In some examples, the dispersion synergist was<br>
absent and replaced by extra pigment.<br><br>
[0240]  An ink composition was made by mixing the pigment, the polymeric<br>
dispersant Solsperse™ 32000, optionally the dispersion synergist and the organic solvent DEGDEE with a dissolver and subsequently treating this mixture with a roller mill procedure using yttrium-stabilized zirconium oxide-beads of 0.4 mm diameter ("high wear resistant zirconia grinding media" from TOSOH Co.). A polyethylene flask of 60mL was filled to half its volume with grinding beads and 20 mL of the mixture. The flask was closed with a lit and put on the roller mill for three days. The speed was set at 150 rpm. After milling the dispersion was separated from the beads using a filter cloth.<br>
[0241]   Using the above method, the comparative inkjet inks COMP-1 to COMP-4 and the inventive inkjet inks INV-1 and INV-2 were prepared. The average particle size and the spectral separation factor SSF were determined to evaluate the dispersion quality and were determined again after a heat treatment of 7 days at 80°C. The results are listed in Table 4.<br><br><br>
[0242]   From Table 4, it is clear that only the comparative Inkjet ink COMP-3 and the Inventive Inkjet inks INV-1 and INV-2 exhibited a good dispersion quality. After heat-treatment, it was found that the average particle size in the comparative Inkjet ink COMP-3 had doubled for PR122, while In the inventive Inkjet ink INV-2 using the same dispersion synergist for PR282 no loss in SSF or increase of average particle size was observed.<br>
[0243]  The pigment PR282 was analyzed with LC-MS and was found to contain:<br>
•	2 area%(UV) of C.I. Pigment Violet 19;<br>
•	67 area%(UV) of C.I. Pigment Red 122; and<br>
•	31area%(UV) of C.I. Pigment Red 192.<br><br><br><br>
