APPARATUS FOR THE COMBUSTION OF GAS EXITING FROM A FURNACE, FOR THE PREHEATING OF SCRAPS ENTERING THE FURNACE ITSELF AND RELATED PROCESS<br>
The present invention refers to an apparatus for the<br>
Combustion of  gas exiting  from  a  furnace,  for the<br>
Preheating of scraps entering the furnace itself and<br>
Related process.<br>
The continuous loading systems of scraps in an electric<br>
arc furnace (EAF) for the production of steel, systems<br>
such  as  CONSTEEL®  for  example,  are  objects  of<br>
increasing interest.<br>
A continuous loading system of scraps in an electric<br>
arc furnace coupled with a preheating system of the<br>
scrap  metal  entering  the  furnace  itself  permits<br>
reducing the treatment times of the scrap metal in the<br>
EAF, and reducing the EAF heat requirement, heat which<br>
is provided as electrical or chemical energy.<br>
In  the  structural  procedure  of  systems  like  the<br>
CONSTEEL®, a by now consolidated procedure, the loading<br>
tunnel of the scrap metal to the furnace, or preheating<br>
chamber, is found under reduced pressure with respect<br>
to the environment, acting as an actual stack, moving<br>
the hot gases generated in the EAF onto the scrap<br>
metal.<br>
The scrap metal thus undergoes a preheating due both to<br><br>
the heat directly transferred from these hot gases to the scrap metal and to the heat generated from the post-combustion of gas exiting from the furnace. To preheat the scrap metal, therefore, it is possible to take advantage of,  as further energy source,  the combustion of the remaining CO coming from the EAF. Currently,  in the consolidated project procedures of continuous loading systems of scrap metal to the EAF, to obtain energy from the CO; an insertion system of comburent substance (air) is used which foresees one or more ventilators and a system of ducts which brings the air along the roof and distributes it along the entire length of the loading tunnel of the scrap metal to the EAF.<br>
The ventilators for the insertion of the comburent substance are controlled by a probe for the oxygen (or for the CO) , which is placed at the bottom of the loading channel or tunnel, near the reception zone of the cool scraps in the loading tunnel.<br>
Depending on the nature of the probe, the probe will detect the absence of CO or the presence of O2 in this zone of the scrap metal channel of loading to the furnace. The absence of CO (or the presence of O2) implies that the combustion reactions are completely finished and have led to the extraction of the maximum possible heat.<br><br>
Nevertheless, a system of this type has considerable drawbacks deriving from a very complex response cycle. Such system is characterised, in fact, by a non-immediate response and by a consequent slowness in carrying out the necessary adaptations of the system itself for optimizing the feeding of comburent substance as a function of the obtained results. In fact, if for example the control probe recognizes the need to inject the comburent substance, the response cycle foresees the opening of the gates for the insertion of air, the actuation of the ventilators for moving the air into the ducts which bring the air along the tunnel roof and the distribution of the air itself along the entire length of the loading tunnel or channel of the scrap metal to the EAF.<br>
The time necessary to carry out such actions is rather long and reduces the overall efficiency of the system. In addition to the non-optimal response times, a further drawback of the system according to the state of the art regards the high production and maintenance costs (service operations and failure possibilities) also considering the high number of mechanical elements (ventilators, ducts, gates) which can be or are subject to failure.<br>
The preheating system according to the state of the art moreover  foresees  a  further device  called  "Dynamic<br><br>
Seal". The Dynamic Seal is a ventilator system with variable capacity, controlled by pressure sensors which remove the air at the inlet point of the scrap metal in the loading channel and which, therefore, prevent the uncontrolled entrance of air above and through the scrap metal. This element of the system is costly, complex, difficult to calibrate and control. The presence of an aspirator in the inlet zone of the scrap metal loading channel, moreover, inserts dust into the surrounding zone coming from the scrap metal or from the lightest portion of the lime added as additive to the load entering the furnace.<br>
General object of the present invention is hence to resolve the abovementioned drawbacks in a simple, economical and particularly functional manner. Particular object is to realize an apparatus for the combustion of the gases exiting from an electric arc furnace for preheating the scraps entering the furnace itself and the related process, and which permits greater cleanliness at the workplace.<br>
In view of the aforesaid objects, object of the present invention is an apparatus for the combustion of gas exiting from an electric arc furnace for the preheating of scraps entering the furnace itself, characterised in that it foresees a device for the introduction of comburent  substance  into  a  preheating  chamber  or<br><br>
loading tunnel of the scrap metal, having an inlet section of the scrap metal, a seal section to prevent the uncontrolled entrance of air in the tunnel, a heating section and an unloading section of the scrap metal in the furnace, said insertion device of the comburent substance comprising one or more adjustable openings placed in the loading tunnel, and said apparatus comprising a device, or a series of devices, of mechanical seal nature, placed in the insertion or inlet section of the scrap metal in the loading tunnel or preheating chamber.<br>
A further object of the present invention is a process for the combustion of gas exiting from an electric arc furnace, for the preheating of furnace load material entering the furnace itself for the production of steel, comprising the following steps:<br>
-	loading the load material or scrap metal to be fed to the furnace, in an extended preheating chamber or loading tunnel, having in sequence: an entrance section of the scrap metal, a seal section to prevent an uncontrolled entrance of air into the tunnel, a preheating section and an unloading section of the scrap metal in the furnace;<br>
-	preheating the scrap metal by means of heat transfer from the hot gases leaving the furnace, which pass through and above the scrap metal inside the chamber;<br><br>
and preheating the scrap metal by means of heat produced by the combustion, inside the chamber, of the unborn CO coming from the furnace;<br>
said process being characterised in that the insertion of comburent substance is realized through an insertion device of the comburent substance comprising one or more adjustable openings in the insertion section of the scrap metal in the furnace and mechanical means, also not equipped with autonomous movement, adapted for reducing of the air insertion in the inlet section of the scrap metal in the loading tunnel or preheating chamber.<br>
In particular, the adjustable openings are placed on the roof of the loading tunnel near the furnace; and more precisely in the inlet section of the scrap metal in the furnace or scrap metal unloading section. Preferably, the insertion device of the comburent substance in the apparatus according to the present invention, comprising one or more adjustable openings placed in the loading tunnel, consists of at least one slit of variable opening situated in the insertion zone of the scrap metal in the furnace, such opening being connected to a centralised control and drive system. Such centralised control and drive system acquires a signal from the probe; the probe can be an O2 or CO probe.<br><br>
As indicated above, the insertion device of the comburent substance (preferably air) , situated in the inlet section of the scrap metal in the furnace or unloading section of the scrap metal, can be integrated by an improved, simplified and low cost device, which reduces the introduction of comburent substance in the inlet section of the scrap metal in the loading channel and, at the same time, reduces the emission of dust into the surrounding environment,<br>
Such improved and simplified device which reduces the uncontrolled introduction of comburent substance in the tunnel and improves the environmental impact in the workplace corresponds to the mechanical seal device of the apparatus according to the present invention, placed in the insertion section of the scrap metal in the loading tunnel.<br>
The mechanical seal device, placed in the inlet section of the scrap metal in the loading tunnel, is formed by at least one rubber or metal gate.<br>
In particular, the mechanical seal, placed in the insertion section of the scrap metal in the loading tunnel, is formed by zero to five gates placed in the inlet section of the insertion section of the scrap metal in the preheating chamber, or cool part, zero to five gates in the intermediate section of the insertion section of the scrap metal in the preheating chamber<br><br>
and zero to five gates in the outlet section, or warmest part, of the inlet section of the scrap metal in the preheating chamber.<br>
Moreover, the gates in the inlet section of the insertion section of the scrap metal in the preheating chamber, or cool part, are thin and flexible or fingerlike, made of rubber or metal, i.e. they are flexible tubes or thin flanking laminae.<br>
The gates in the intermediate section of the insertion section of the scrap metal in the preheating chamber are metal sheets with flanking flexible laminae, while the gates in the outlet section, or the warmest part of the insertion section of the scrap metal in the preheating chamber, are composed of massive, iron panels, hinged to the fixed upper structure of the channel.<br>
In f act, in such innermost part of the loading channel or tunnel, the gates are directly exposed to the flow of hot gases coming from the furnace and from the heat radiated from the furnace and from the warmest part of the loading channel.<br>
Such mechanical device ensures a strong reduction of the air flow, making the presence of the "Dynamic Seal" superfluous.<br>
All of these solutions in fact permit following the edge of the scraps, reducing the total flow of air in<br><br>
the channel. The absence of a ventilator which suctions directly from the scrap metal eliminates the problem of the environmental emission of the dust present on the scrap metal (accumulated by piling in open-air deposits) as well as the lightest portions of the additive materials on the scrap metal.<br>
The substantial advantage of the system according to the present invention consists in a substantial reduction of the response times such to permit obtaining a response in real time and a significant improvement of the environmental impact characteristics of the line.<br>
A further advantage of the system according to the present invention is its greater simplicity, since the various gates and ventilators foreseen in the systems according to the state of the art have been eliminated. The apparatus and process according to the present invention have a further considerable economical advantage (regarding the initial investment and the conduction and maintenance costs as well as those pertaining to the system availability), since they also permit eliminating the "Dynamic Seal" from the continuous preheating system of scraps.<br>
The apparatus according to the present invention, which permits excluding such component, is therefore advantageously less burdensome (in terms of equipment<br><br>
cost and maintenance and service costs), simpler and more reliable than that traditionally obtained with a ^'Dynamic Seal" .<br>
The solution according to the present invention moreover has the advantage of an improved and more targeted control of the comburent substance (for example air) in order to complete the combustion of combustible substances present in the scrap metal. All this improves the efficiency of the line (in terms of quality and cost per ton of the final product) as well as its environmental impact both at the factory level and regarding the overall atmosphere emissions. Obi act of the present invention is also a process for refining steel comprising:<br>
-	continuous preheating of the load material;<br>
-	feeding of said material containing iron, directly<br>
reduced iron, or a blend of both in an electric arc<br>
furnace in order to perform smelting and refining<br>
operations;<br>

-	introduction of carbureting elements in the furnace for steel production;<br>
-	electrical heating of the load using electrodes to melt the load and form a bath of melted metal in the furnace with a layer of melted slag on said melted<br><br>
metal bath;<br>
-	maintaining said slag in a foamy condition during the<br>
steel production process;<br>
feeding  of  metal  elements,   slag  formers  and carburising elements into said furnace;<br>
-	maintaining full electrical power capacity in said furnace for the total loading, smelting and refining time;<br>
-	intermittent tapping from the furnace, maintaining a liquid metal heel inside the furnace shell, said liquid metal heel approximately representing a weight that varies between 10% and 30% of the weight prior to tapping;<br>
such process being characterised m that the preheating step of the melted material in turn comprises the following steps:<br>
loading of the material, or scrap metal, to be fed to the furnace, into an extended preheating chamber or loading tunnel having in sequence: an inlet section of the scrap metal, a seal section to prevent an uncontrolled entrance of air into the tunnel, a preheating section and an unloading section of the scrap metal into the furnace.<br>
preheating of the scrap metal by means of heat transfer from the hot gases exiting the furnace which pass through and above the scrap metal within the<br><br>
chamber;<br>
and preheating of the scrap metal by means of heat<br>
produced from the combustion inside the chamber of<br>
the unbent CO coming from the furnace; said process being characterised in that the insertion of comburent substance is realized through an insertion device of the comburent substance comprising one or more adjustable openings in the inlet section of the scrap metal into the furnace and mechanical means, also not equipped with autonomous movement; adapted to reduce the introduction of air in the inlet section of the scrap metal in the loading tunnel or preheating chamber.<br>
Object of the present invention is also an apparatus for steel refining comprising:<br>
an electric arc furnace for the production of steel<br>
for smelting and refining a load of metal at its<br>
interior;<br>
electrodes  which  extend  into  said  furnace  to  a<br>
distance below the slag level in a bath of melted<br>
material therein contained;<br>
feeding means connected to said furnace for the introduction of load materials inside said furnace without the removal of the electrodes;<br>
- post-combustion means associated to cooperate with said  feeding  means  in  order  to  preheat  the  load<br><br>
materials inside said feeding means;<br>
-	means for measuring and controlling load material or scrap metal feeding comprising an automatic control device for the load material or scrap metal, and a device for measuring the added load material, in correlation with the automatic control device;<br>
-	a mechanical seal device located in the insertion section of the load material to the feeding means/<br>
gas injection means that communicate with said furnace above and/or below the normal melted metal level in the bath; and<br>
means for tilting said furnace for slogging and tapping operations, the tapping means being arranged in a manner so that said slant of said furnace will maintain a heel of melted liquid material inside said bath, said heel having a weight that varies approximately between 10% and 3 0% of the weight prior to tapping.<br>
The structural and functional characteristics of the present invention and its advantages in relation to the prior art will be made clearer and more obvious from the following description, with reference to the appended drawings wherein:<br>
Figure 1 is a vertical section of an embodiment of the apparatus according to the present inventions-Figure 2 is a top view of the apparatus of figure 1;<br><br>
Figure 3 is a vertical section of the apparatus of figure 1 according to the present invention; With reference  to  the drawings,  in general  and to figure 1 in particular, an embodiment of an apparatus is shown according to the present invention, where an electric arc furnace for the production of steel 10 has an extended preheating chamber or tunnel 12, preferably a vibrating channel, for inserting the both metal and non-metal load materials into the furnace. The furnace 10, represented as a three-phase electric furnace, can also alternatively be a continuous current furnace, a plasma furnace or an induction furnace. The preheating tunnel or chamber 12 has an extended support 14 covered by a corresponding extended shield, preferably coated with refractory material. The preheating chamber or tunnel 12 has a mechanical seal device 18 at the inlet end of the load material, and starting from the inlet end of the load material, the preheating tunnel or chamber sequentially comprises an inlet or insertion section of the load material 21, comprising  the  seal  system  18  for  preventing  an uncontrolled entrance of air into the tunnel, one or more heating sections or zones 24,  and a material unloading section 26,<br>
The furnace 10 has an outlet opening 2 8 of the emission gases.<br><br>
The unloading section of the material of the preheating<br>
tunnel is mounted on a connection trolley 30 for an<br>
axial  telescopic  movement  in  engagement  with  the<br>
opening  of  the  furnace  2 8  which  effectively  and<br>
healingly connects the stationary tunnel or chamber 12<br>
with the furnace 10, which can be tilted.<br>
The  connection  trolley  feeds  the  scraps  from  the<br>
preheating tunnel or chamber to the furnace,  in the<br>
correct zone inside the furnace,<br>
The connection trolley is advantageously mounted on a<br>
track 32.<br>
The emission gases of the furnace 10, rich in CO and<br>
whose  temperature  is generally around 1300°C,  enter<br>
into the heating chamber 12 of the scraps  (which the<br>
smoke outlet duct 42 places under reduced pressure)<br>
through the material unloading opening 28.<br>
The emission gas of the furnace provides the heating in<br>
the preheating chamber of the load material in two main<br>
ways:  by means of the considerable heat of the gas<br>
itself  (which flows through the scrap metal)  and by<br>
means of the combustion of the unborn CO present in<br>
the emission gases of the furnace.<br>
The heating section 24 is provided with one or more<br>
adjustable openings 34 placed in the loading tunnel in<br>
the area of the section 26 close to the insertion zone<br>
of the preheated scrap metal in the furnace, opening 34<br><br>
being connected to a centralised control system (38, shown in figure 2).<br>
The combustion of the CO coming from the furnace (the chemical reaction between the combustible material - CO and comburent substance - for example air) is ensured, sustained, and maintained by the temperature of the gases (up to 1,300°C) which in any case exceeds the fire point.<br>
The variable opening of the slit (s) 34 (and in general the injection of the comburent substance)  is governed by  the  line  controller  in  (direct  or  inverse) proportion to the signal extracted from the CO or O2 probe (40).<br>
An oxygen or CO probe 4 0 is arranged either in the outlet section 42 or still in the zone 24 but close to the smoke outlet duct 42 (as seen in figure 2) . This probe 4 0 controls the introduction of air through the insertion device comprising the adjustable opening 34 to allow the operating conditions to vary rapidly in response to the composition variations of the emission gases from the furnace.<br>
The oxygen probe 40, which can also be a multiple gas analyzer, operates on the adjustment of the comburent insertion device and on the level of combustion in the chamber 12. A small quantity of air enters into the seal zone 21 to<br><br>
prevent an uncontrolled entrance of air in the tunnel<br>
12 through the mechanical seal device 18.<br>
The scraps load enters into the preheating chamber on a<br>
belt through mechanical seal closure 18.<br>
The device of  treatment of the emission gases and<br>
suction of the preheated is connected to the chamber 12<br>
in proximity to and above the mechanical seal closure<br>
18 through the duct 42.<br>
The protective  scope of  the  invention  is  therefore<br>
defined by the attached claims.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
