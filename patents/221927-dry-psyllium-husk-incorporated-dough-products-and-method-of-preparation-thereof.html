2. APPLICANT (S)(a)	NAME:(b)	NATIONALITY:(c)	ADDRESS:	PATEL KAUSHIK KESHAVLALan Indian201, Prashant Apartment,Near Karelibaug Post Office,Karelibaug,Vadodara-390018.Gujarat, India.<br>
3. PREMABLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
PROVISIONALThe following specification describes the invention.		0       COMPLETEThe following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br><br><br>
The present invention relates to dry psyllium husk incorporated dough products and method of preparation thereof.<br>
In  the  present  invention  dry psyllium   husk  is  used  in  the preparation of the dough products. The process for preparation of dough products is simple, less time consuming and cost-effective.<br>
 Background of the Invention:<br>
Extensive research has been carried out into the physiological effects of dietary fiber and there is evidence that a low intake may be associated with a number of diseases. Inverse relationships between fiber intake and the incidence of obesity, heart disease, cholesterol, cancers (of the colon and breast), diabetes and gastrointestinal disorders have been reported. Dietary fiber may also bind toxins, bile acids and carcinogens [From; http://www.ifst.org/hottop33.htm -Institute of Food Science &amp; Technology, UK]. Thus fiber content in the food .plays an important role in the natural functioning of the body. The Nutrient Facts Panel for U.S. Food Regulations has determined that the target percentage daily value for dietary fiber is about 25 grams in a 2000 calorie per day diet and about 30 grams in a 2500 calorie per day diet.<br>
Psyllium is "one of the best source of natural dietary fiber. The source of psyllium is the seeds of plants of the Plantago genus. Various<br>
2<br><br>
species such as Plantago lanceolate, Plantago ruqeltl, and Plantago major are known. Commercial psyllium seed husk is typically obtained from the French*(black; Plantago indica), Spanish (Plantago psyllium) or Indian (blonde; Plantago ovata) psyllium seeds, which grow in certain subtropical regions. Indian (blonde) psyllium husk is preferred for use herein. Since it is believed by those skilled in the art that the active ingredient of psyllium is the psyllium seed gum, which is located primarily in the seed husk, present technology uses the ground seed husk as the source of psyllium. However the whole seed is also known as a psyllium source, as well as the dehusked psyllium seed, Psyllium husk, powder typically contains 70% Soluble Dietary Fibre (SDF) and 87% Total, Dietary Fibre (TDF).<br>
The specific use of a psyllium hydrophilic mucilloid to lower cholesterol in serum was documented by Anderson et al., Arch. Intern. Med. Vol. 148, February 1988, 292-296 (1988), Anderson et al., Am J. Clin Nutr. Vol.56, p. 93-98, (July 1992).<br>
Three to twelve grams of soluble fiber from psyllium, as part of a low fat diet, can reduce total cholesterol by about five percent and lower LDL cholesterol by about nine percent. (From: Psyllium-enriched cereals lower blood total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol: Results of a meta-analysis. J. Nutr. (1997) 127:1973-80.)<br>
3<br><br>
High—fiber foods, because of their consistency, encourage mastication and stimulate the secretion of digestive juices. The soluble components of dietary fiber cause an increase in the viscosity of the stomach contents, thereby retarding gastric emptying. This then affects the rate of digestion and the uptake of nutrients and creates a feeling of satiety. [From: http://www,ifst.ora/hottop33.htm - Institute of Food Science &amp; Technology, UK]. For these reasons, incorporating psyllium husk and other sources of fiber into the diet may aid in reducing obesity.<br>
Soluble fiber in psyllium inhibits the digestion and absorption of carbohydrates thus lowering Glycemic Index which, causes slow release of sugar in the blood stream, thus helping to control diabetes. This also improves the efficiency of insulin in the cells and hence may decrease the need for external insulin if the person is insulin dependent.<br>
Psyllium's emollient, demulcent and laxative effects are helpful in treatment of constipation (by softening the stool thereby increasing speed and the passage of stool and absorbing water thereby producing more bulk), diarrhea (by soaking up a significant amount of water in the digestive track and thereby making stool firmer), irritable bowel syndrome (by regulating stool frequency and consistency), hemorrhoids (psyllium helps to soften the stool and reduce the pain<br>
4<br><br>
 associated with hemorrhoids). It is also useful in the treatment of amoebic and bacillary dysentery, inflammatory bowel disease, and colon cancer.<br>
However, due to its mucilaginous nature, psyllium acquires a slimy or adhesive texture and mouthfeel upon hydration. Psyllium normally forms a gelatinous mass when contacted with water and exhibits poor dispersibility and mixability in water. Psyllium also develops a distinctive, undesirable flavor in the presence of heat and moisture  which further limits its use in food products. This slimy mouthfeel is unpalatable and, accordingly, various additives have been incorporated in psyllium-containing ingestible compositions in order to mask the undesirable texture and mouthfeel of the psyllium.<br>
US patent 5,126,150 discloses composition containing psyllium in which calcium lactate coated psyllium fiber, insoluble dietary fiber, shortening, flour, sugar and water are used in making baked cookies.<br>
U.S. Patent 5,384,136 discloses psyllium-enriched dough products and method for making the same. The dough product is prepared using gluten and contains prewetted psyllium from 1.0 to 5.0 grams per one ounce of dough product. The method of making the dough product comprises firstly formation of extruded psyllium pellets by using psyllium, sweetening agent and flour ingredient. Further grinding the extruded psyllium pellets to form a powder; prewetting<br>
5<br><br>
 said psyllium powder and forming its composition; finally blending the said psyllium composition with a dough base to form a dough product. Moreover process is also cumbersome and lengthy, Prewetting procedure requires constant observation otherwise it may cause growth of microorganisms.<br>
U.S. Patent 5,955,123 discloses baked compositions comprising psyllium husk from smooth textured METAMUCIL RTM. Herein more than 90% of psyllium used having particle size smaller than 45 mesh. In the dough preparation the psyllium is agglomerated with other agglomerating materials.<br>
The techniques mentioned in the above stated inventions are either laborious, require special handling or required specially treated psyllium. They also mentioned that "neat" psyllium when combined with other ingredients or hydrated before the compositions are baked leads to an unpalatable product and hence cannot be incorporated into dough products. Also none of them explain the effects of purity and particle size of psyllium husk on dough products and the amount of additional water that would be required to properly bind dough having psyllium husk due to the mucilaginous nature of psyllium. So there is a requirement of technique, which is simple and effective.<br>
6<br><br>
In the present invention, psyllium husk having particular particle size, purity and colour is incorporated in the dough products, with specific amount of additional water, which gives better results.<br>
 Detail Description of Invention<br>
The main object of the present invention is to prepare dry psyllium husk-incorporated dough products and method of preparation thereof.<br>
In the present invention the dough products included are but not limited to bread, muffin, pizza crust, pretzel, sweet roll, croissant, bagel, English muffin, cookie, pancake, biscuit, donut, piecrust, etc. wherein leavening agents are used and ;noodles, pastas, spaghetti, macroni, Indian breads (roti, puri, paratha, naan, and khakhra) etc. wherein leavening agents are not used.<br>
In the present invention flour is selected from but not limited to wheat flour, whole wheat flour, rye flour, corn flours and sorghum flour.<br>
One or more leavening agents may also be included which may include yeast and non-yeast leavening agents, include a source of carbon dioxide such as sodium bicarbonate or potassium bicarbonate alone or in combination with a leavening acid such as monocalcium phosphate, dicalcium phosphate, sodium acid pyrophosphate, sodium<br>
7<br><br>
aluminum; sulfate, sodium aluminum phosphate, potassium acid tartrate and the like.<br>
Unless otherwise stated or indicated, the percentage of psyllium husk is expressed as a weight percent of the flour ingredient, amount of additional water is expressed per 1gmof psyllium husk and weight of the ingredients are expressed in grams. Screen mesh sizes used in this invention are based on U.S. standards.<br>
The Psyllium husk used in this invention is whole, fragmented, slitted, normal, bleached, snow white or processed source of psyllium husk powder. Specifications of psyllium husk powder are as below.<br><br>

Additional Water to bind the dough containing psyllium husk<br>
Psyllium husk absorbs water instantly to form a gelatinous mass causing formation of lumps in the dough, not allowing the dough to remain intact and preventing the development of gluten in dough products wherein leavening agents are used. The development of gluten is essential to accommodate the gases produced by the leavening agents, Hence an appropriate amount of additional water is required to bind the dough without lumps, make it remain intact and allow the development of gluten.<br>
If higher amount of additional water is used then the dough becomes over hydrated. Dough products wherein leavening agents are used do not raise well, has dense crumb and are unpalatable. If lower amount of additional water is used then dough product becomes dry and does not remain intact and has poorly developed gluten. As per this invention the right quantity of additional water to bind dough having psyllium is 4.5 gm ± 20% depending upon the climatic condition, strength of the flour and related parameters. Because of this specific amount of water, dough can bind easily, remain intact and proper development of gluten can be achieved. <br>
Particle size of psyllium husk powder<br>
Psyllium husk powder is available in various particle sizes (30 to 300 mesh size). Dough products wherein leavening agents are used do<br>
9<br><br>
not rise well and has dense crumb structure on using too smaller or too bigger particle size. To overcome these problems, as per this invention the particle size of psyllium husk for incorporation into dough products wherein leavening agents are used may preferably range from 40 to 200 mesh, more preferably range from 60 to 150 mesh and most preferably range from 80 to 120 mesh.<br>
Use of smaller- particle size psyllium husk in dough products wherein leavening agents are not used, makes the dough more elastic, preventing the processing of dough like rolling Indian breads, extruding pastas and noodles, etc. To overcome these problems, as per this invention the particle size of psyllium husk for incorporation into dough products wherein leavening agents are not used may preferably range, from whole psyllium husk or fragmented psyllium husk or slitted psyllium husk to 100 mesh, more preferably range from 20 to 80 mesh and most preferably range from 30 to 50 mesh.<br>
Due to the mucilaginous nature of psyllium, dough products acquire slimy or adhesive texture and poor mouthfeel if excessive psyllium husk is incorporated in  the dough product. As per this invention psyllium husk can be incorporated upto 8% of the flour ingredient into dough products using the amount of additional water -and the proper size of the psyllium' husk particles mentioned previously in this invention.<br>
10<br><br>
Effects of adding gluten flour<br>
Addition of gluten flour provides extra strength to the dough products wherein leavening agents are used which, can also help in incorporation of higher amount of psyllium husk. In the present invention addition of gluten flour upto 2% of the flour ingredient can increase psyllium husk incorporation upto 14% of the flour ingredient.<br>
Although the invention has been described with reference to use of psyllium husk, it is not meant to be construed in a limiting sense. In the present invention psyllium seed can also be used. Using psyllium husk powder having purity below 95% e.g. psyllium seed powder, 70% pure or 85% pure psyllium husk powder does not adversely affect the incorporation except that it yields a grayish brown colour to brown colour. Various purity of psyllium husk powder is available. As per this invention psyllium husk powder having purity above 95% produces dough products which are equally at par with dough products without psyllium in terms of colour, taste, aroma, etc. Bleached and Snow White Psyllium husk powder can also be used to further improve the colour of the dough products.<br>
However, apart from the therapeutic advantages of psyllium, a low purity i.e. psyllium husk powder having purity below 95% can be used to impart brownish colour to food products.<br>
11<br><br>
Embodiment of the present invention relates process for preparing dough products, which involves following steps:<br>
(l)Dry psyllium husk is blended with the flour during making of a dough product or psyllium&gt;is*added to the grains during grinding of the grains or mixed with flour at any suitable stage of manufacture of flour. (2)Remaining ingredients are added and mixed well. <br>
(3)Water and additional water for psyllium husk is added.<br>
 (4)Dough is prepared.<br>
(5) Processing the dough further depending upon the dough product required.<br>
