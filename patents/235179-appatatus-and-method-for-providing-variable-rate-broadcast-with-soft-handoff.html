BACKGROUND Field<br>
[0002]	This disclosure relates generally to wireless communications. More specifically,<br>
embodiments disclosed herein relate to providing variable rate broadcast with soft handoff m wireless communications.<br>
Background<br>
[0003J	Wireless communication systems are widely deployed to provide various types<br>
of communications (such as voice and data) to multiple users. Such systems may be based on code division multiple access (CDMA), time division multiple access (TDMA), frequency division multiple access (FDMA), or other multiple access techniques. A wireless communication system may be designed to implement one or more standards, such as IS-95, cdma2000, IS-856, W-CDMA, TD-SCDMA, and other standards.<br>
[0004]	Broadcast and multicast services have been proposed to effectively transmit<br>
large quantities of data from a single source point to a group of users in wireless communication systems. Contents suitable for such point-to-multipoint services include news, stock quotes, sports events, movies, audio and video clips, and other multimedia data. As the demand for transmission of multimedia data grows, there lies a challenge to enhance the spectral efficiency and maximize the data rates of broadcast/multicast services.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0014]	Embodiments disclosed herein relate to methods and systems for providing<br>
variable rate broadcast services with soft handoff in communication systems.<br>
[0015]	A unicast communication described herein may generally refer to any one-to-<br>
one transmission of voice and/or data from a single source to a single receiver. In a wireless (e.g., cellular) communication system, a unicast communication may involve transmission from one or more transmitters (e.g., at an access network) to a single receiver (e.g., an access terminal). A broadcast/multicast communication (or service) described herein may generally refer to any point-to-multipoint transmission of data from a single source to a group of users in a broadcast area, which may include one or more sectors (or cells).<br>
[0016]	For a given broadcast service, an access network may receive a stream of<br>
information from a content server and transmit the information on a designated channel to a group of users in a broadcast area. The content of a broadcast commumcation (termed "broadcast content" herein) may be encapsulated in data packets (termed "broadcast packets" herein), as specified by appropriate protocols (such as Internet<br><br>
WO 2006/IN46J0	PCT/US2005/025523<br>
Protocol (IP)). A broadcast content may include (but not limited to) text, audio, pictures, video, data files, software upgrades, and other information.<br>
[0017]	A broadcast/multicast service may have a controlled access, e.g., only the users<br>
subscribing to the service receive the desired broadcast content on their access terminals. Unsubscribed users have no access to the broadcast/multicast service. Such controlled access may be achieved by encrypting the broadcast transmission/content in a manner that allows only the subscribers to decrypt the received broadcast content, for example.<br>
[0018]	An  access  network   controller  (ANC)  may  refer  to  the portion  of a<br>
communication system configured to interface with a core network (e.g., a packet data network) and route data packets between access terminals (ATs) and the core network, perform various radio access and link maintenance functions (such as soft handoff), control radio transmitters and receivers, and so on. An ANC may include and/or implement the functions of a base station controller (BSC), such as found in a 2nd or 3rd generation wireless network. An ANC and one or more access points (APs) may constitute part of an access network (AN). An AP described herein may also be referred to as a base-station transceiver system (BTS), an access network transceiver (ANT), a modem pool transceiver (MPT), or a Node B (e.g., in a W-CDMA type system), etc. A cell may refer to a coverage area serviced by an AP. A cell may further include one or more sectors. A broadcast area may include one or more cells.<br>
[0019]	An AT described herein may refer to various types of devices, including (but not<br>
limited to) a wireless phone, a cellular phone, a laptop computer, a wireless communication personal computer (PC) card, a personal digital assistant (PDA), an external or internal modem, etc. An AT may be any data device that communicates through a wireless channel or through a wired channel (e.g., by way of fiber optic or coaxial cables). An AT may have various names, such as access unit, subscriber unit, mobile station, mobile device, mobile unit, mobile phone, mobile, remote station, remote terminal, remote unit, user device, user equipment, handheld device, etc. Different ATs may be incorporated into a system. ATs may be mobile or stationary, and may be dispersed throughout a communication system. An AT may communicate with one or more APs on a forward link and/or a reverse link at a given moment The forward link (or downlink) refers to transmission from an AP to an AT. The reverse link (or uplink) refers to transmission from the AT to the AP.<br><br>
WO 2006/014610	PCT/US2005/025523<br>
[0020]	In a wireless communication system implementing a broadcast/multicast service,<br>
soft handoff may be used to increase the broadcast transmission rate. In soft handoff, identical transmissions from one or more APs may be received and combined at an AT, hence allowing the AT to support a higher data rate. Because a broadcast content is intended to be received by multiple users dispersed in a broadcast area, broadcast transmissions are typically identical across various cells in the broadcast area. In some systems, broadcast transmissions may be of CDMA format, and each subscribing AT may soft-combine transmissions from APs servicmg different cells, e.g., using a Rake receiver and/or an equalized receiver. In other systems, broadcast transmissions may be of orthogonal frequency division multiplex (OFDM) format, and each subscribing AT may soft-combine transmissions from APs servicing different cells, e.g., using a demodulation scheme based on Fast Fourier Transform (FFT).<br>
[0021]	In practice, however, cells in a broadcast area may have different supportable<br>
data rates. Consider, for example, a broadcast area including a dense urban network with a core of capacity-limited cells which are typically small in size, surrounded by a suburban network with larger coverage-limited cells. Because the supportable data rate typically varies with the ratio of the total received power (e.g., from all cells involved in soft handoff) to the total interference power, the maximum supportable broadcast rate for a small urban cell may be higher than that for a large suburban cell. To implement soft handoff in such a system, however, broadcast transmissions may have to be carried out at the lowest supportable rate amongst various cells in the broadcast area, hence unduly limiting the spectral efficiency of the system.<br>
[0022]	A need therefore exists for improving the spectral efficiency and maximizing the<br>
broadcast transmission rate of broadcast/multicast services.<br>
[0023]	To improve the overall spectral efficiency, it would be desirable to operate the<br>
broadcast transmissions at a variable rate in relation to the coverages of the cells. To maximize the broadcast transmission rate, it would be desirable to operate the broadcast transmissions in soft handoff. Embodiments disclosed herein relate to methods and systems for providing broadcast/multicast services at a variable rate while preserving soft handoff, thereby enhancing the overall spectral efficiency and maximizing the broadcast transmission rate.<br>
10024]	In an emrjodiment, a plurality of APs (e.g., servicing various cells in a broadcast<br>
area) may transmit a broadcast content in accordance with a rate set The rate set may<br><br>
WO 2006/014610	PCT/US2005/025523<br>
include a plurality of distinct data rates each associated with a transmission format (e.g., specifying the number of transmission slots for transmitting a data packet), configured to allow the broadcast packets transmitted by the APs to be incrementally combined (e.g., on a per-slot basis at a subscribing AT). By way of example, consider a rate set including three data rates: Rj = R (e.g., 1843.2kbps), R2 = R/2 (e.g., 921.6kbps), and R3 = R/3 (e.g., 614.4kbps), e.g., associated with 1-slot, 2-slot, and 3-slot transmission format, respectively. The first slots of broadcast transmissions at the three rates are identical and may be soft-combined. The second slots of broadcast transmissions at rates R2 and R3 are identical and may also be soft-combined. Thus, to implement variable rate broadcast, the rate set may be so configured to allow for incremental combining, such as described above. The rate set may also be configured to support soft handoff in the broadcast area, as fiirther described below.<br>
[0025]	Various aspects, features, and embodiments are described in further details<br>
below.<br>
[0026]	FIG. 1 illustrates a schematic diagram of a communication system 100, in which<br>
various disclosed embodiments may be implemented. By way of example, system 100 may include a plurality of APs 110, such as APs 1 lOa-110c, each servicing a cell (not explicitly shown in FIG. 1). Various ATs 120, including ATs 120a-120d, are dispersed in various cells throughout the system. Each AT 120 may communicate with one or more APs 110, e.g., depending upon whether the AT is active and whether it is in soft handoff.<br>
[0027]	In system 100, an ANC 130 may be in communication with and serve to provide<br>
coordination and control for APs 110. For example, ANC 130 may be configured to control the routing of voice/data packets to ATs 120 via the corresponding APs 110. ANC 130 may be further in communication with a data network, e.g., via a packet data service node (PDSN) (both of which are not explicitly shown in FIG. 1). In some embodiments, system 100 may be configured to support one or more wireless communication standards, e.g., IS-95, cdma2000, IS-856, W-CDMA, TD-SCDMA, other wireless communication standards, or a combination thereof.<br>
[0028]	System 100 may also be configured to implement a broadcast/multicast service,<br>
e.g., in a broadcast area 140. For example, ANC 130 may route a broadcast content (e.g., received from a data network which may also include a content server) to APs 110, which may in turn transmit the broadcast content to ATs 120 in broadcast area 140.<br><br>
WO 2006/014610	PCT/US2005/025523<br>
(0029]	In an embodiment, the broadcast/multicast service may be carried out at a<br>
variable rate with soft handoff. For example, ANC 130 may select a rate set including a plurality of distinct data rates each associated with a transmission format, configured to allow the broadcast transmissions to be incrementally combined (such as described above). The rate set may be selected in relation to the supportable data rates of the cells serviced by APs 110 in broadcast area 140, as well as the requirements for supporting soft handoff in such cells, as further described below. The rate set may also be selected based in part on the size of the broadcast content to be transmitted. AN 130 may then instruct APs 110 to transmit the broadcast content in accordance with the selected rate set. ATs 120 in broadcast area 140 may incrementally combine (e.g., on a per-slot basis) the broadcast packets received from various APs 110. For example, AT 120b may incrementally combine the broadcast packets from APs 110a, 110b, e.g., received via forward links 150, 152, respectively. AT 120c may incrementally combine the broadcast packets from APs UOb, 110c, e.g., received via forward links 154, 156, respectively.<br>
[0030]	As described above, to implement variable rate broadcast with soft handoff, the<br>
broadcast data rate and corresponding transmission format for a given cell need to be configured such to support soft handoff for the cell as well as the neighboring cells mat reply on the cell for soft handoff, as the following examples illustrate. For illustration and clarity, the soft handoff coverage for a given cell (e.g., one or more neighboring cells that support the cell in soft handoff) extends to the adjacent cells in the examples below. Such should not be construed as limiting. The underlying principles and procedures thus described may be applied to other situations where the soft-handoff coverage extends beyond the adjacent cells.<br>
10031]	FIGs.   2A-2D   illustrate   an   embodiment   of a  broadcast   area  200   in   a<br>
communication system, including a plurality of cells. For illustration and clarity, cells<br>
in these figures are shown to be uniform in shape and size. Such should not be<br>
construed as limiting. In other embodiments, cells may have varying sizes and shapes<br>
(and may be omni-directional or sectorized). Also for clarity and simplicity, APs<br>
servicing and ATs dispersed in such cells are not explicitly shown in these figures.<br>
[00321	Consider A-cell(s) 210 illustrated in FIG. 2A. A-cell 210 may for example be<br>
part of a dense urban network, capable of supporting a higher data rate. Suppose that A-cell 210 is capable of supporting a data rate of R, corresponding to a transmission<br><br>
WO 2006/014610	PCT/US2005/025523<br>
format of n slots (n being an integer, e.g., n=l). To support soft handoff in A-cell 210, the neighboring cells (such as those illustrated with similar patterns) also need to be able to support the 1-slot transmission format.<br>
[0033]	FIG. 2B illustrate a group of B-cells 220.  Suppose that each B-cell 220 is also<br>
capable of supporting the data rate R, hence the 1-slot transmission format. To support soft handoff in each B-cell 220, the neighboring cells (such as those illustrated with similar patterns) also need to be able to support the 1-slot transmission format.<br>
[0034]	FIG. 2C illustrate a group of C-cells 230, which may for example be part of a<br>
large suburban network. Suppose that each C-cell 230 is able to support a data rate of (n/m)R (n and m being integers, e.g., n=l, m=3), corresponding to a transmission format of 3 slots. To support soft handoff in each C-cell 230, the neighboring cells (such as those illustrated with similar patterns) also need to be able to support the 3-slot transmission format.<br>
[0035]	To satisfy the requirements for supporting soft handoff in all cells (e.g., A-cell<br>
210, B-cells 220, and C-cells 230), such as described above, each B-cell 220 needs to be able to support the 1-slot transmission format as well as the 3-slot transmission format, so as to assist A-cell 210 and C-cells 230 in soft handoff. Because the data rates are such that the first slots of broadcast transmissions in both the 1-slot and 3-slot transmission formats are identical, each B-cell 220 may be assigned the 3-slot transmission format, as shown in FIG. 2D (where B-cells 220 are illustrated with patterns similar to those used for C-cells 230). In this way, the first slots of broadcast transmissions in A-cell 210 are identical and may be soft-combined. Because B-cells 220 are capable of supporting the 1-slot transmission format, ATs in B-cells may successfully decode the broadcast packets after the first slot; the remaining two slots of broadcast transmissions may serve to support soft handoff in C-cells 230, as further illustrated in FIG. 3 below.<br>
[0036]	FIG. 3 illustrates an embodiment of timelines of broadcast transmissions in the<br>
embodiment of FIG. 2D described above. Legend 310 serves to denote the pair of indices used to label each transmission slot.   As illustrated in FIG. 3, for A-cell(s),<br>
transmission slots beyond the first slot may be used for unicast transmissions. Because B-cells are able to support the 1-slot transmission format, ATs in B-cells may successfully decode the broadcast packets after the first slot (as in A-cells); the<br><br>
WO 20(16/014610	PCT/US2005/025523<br>
remaining two slots serve to support the incremental combining (e.g., on a per-slot<br>
basis) in C-cells.<br>
[0037]	As illustrated in FIG. 2D and FIG. 3, B-cells may act as "buffer" cells to<br>
effectively isolate two coverage areas (e.g., A-cell(s) and C-cells) supporting different data rates, while preserving soft handoff. As illustrated above, such buffer cells may be capable of supporting the data rate of some neighboring cells (having a higher supportable data rate) but assigned the same transmission format as that for other neighboring cells (having a lower supportable data rate), hence allowing the neighboring cells to receive broadcast transmissions at different data rates while preserving soft handoff (e.g., by allowing for incremental combining such as described above). Such a variable rate approach enhances the overall spectral efficiency by minimizing the fraction of slots allocated to broadcast transmissions, while maximizing the broadcast data rate by preserving soft handoff. As shown in FIG. 3, without such an approach, broadcast transmissions to A-cells would have to be in the 3-slot transmission format and as a result, the transmission slots allocated for unicast transmissions would have to be used for broadcast transmissions as well, hence limiting the overall spectral efficiency.<br>
[0038]	FIG. 4 illustrates a flow diagram of a process 400, which may be used in an<br>
embodiment to implement variable rate broadcast with soft handoff. Step 410 assigns a nominal rate to each cell in relation to the cell being in soft handoff with one or more neighboring cells (e.g., in a given soft handoff coverage). The nominal rate may for example take into account the soft handoff support the neighboring cells would provide. In some embodiments, the nominal data rates assigns to various cells in a broadcast area may be configured to allow for incremental combining, such as described above. Step 420 identifies a minimum (or lowest) nominal rate assigned to each cell and the neighboring cells with which it is in soft handoff (e.g., the same neighboring cells considered in step 410). Step 430 assigns to each cell a broadcast data rate equal to the minimum nominal rate thus identified.<br>
10039]	FIG. 5 illustrates a flow diagram of a process 500, which may be used in an<br>
embodiment to implement variable rate broadcast with soft handoff. Step 510 selects a<br>
rate set, including a plurality of distinct data rates each associated with a transmission format Step 520 instructs a plurality of APs to transmit a broadcast content in accordance with the rate set* the rate set configured to allow broadcast packets<br><br>
WO 2006/014610	PCT/US2005/025523<br>
transmitted by the APs to be incrementally combined (e.g., on a per-slot basis at an AT). In some embodiments, the data rates and corresponding transmission formats in the rate set may be selected and assigned to the APs in relation to supportable data rates of the cells serviced by the APs, as well as the constraints imposed by the neighboring cells for supporting soft handoff, such as described above. The rate set may also be selected based in part on the size of the broadcast content to be transmitted.<br>
[0040]	FIG. 6 depicts a flow diagram of a process 600, which may be used in an<br>
embodiment to implement variable rate broadcast with soft handoff. Step 610 assigns to a first AP n slots for transmitting a broadcast content and (m - n) slots for unicast transmissions (m and n being integers and m &gt; n). Step 620 assigns to a second AP m slots for transmitting the broadcast content. Step 630 assigns to a third AP m slots for transmitting the broadcast content. In one embodiment, the first AP may service a first cell capable of supporting a data rate of R. The second AP may service a second cell adjacent to the first cell, which is also capable of supporting the data rate R. The third AP may service a third cell adjacent to the second cell, which capable of supporting a data rate of (n/m) R, such as described above.<br>
[0041]	FIG. 7 depicts a flow diagram of a process 700, which may be used in an<br>
embodiment to implement variable rate broadcast with soft handoff. Step 710 sets a slot index i to be zero. Step 720 selects a transmission slot and increment the slot index by 1 (i = i + 1). Step 730 determines if i

implement some disclosed embodiments (such as described above). By way of example, apparatus 800 may include a rate-set-selecting unit (or module) 810 configured to select a rate set, including a plurality of distinct data rates each associated<br><br>
