Method of anodizing of magnesium and magnesium alloys and producing conductive layers on an anodized surface<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is directed to tlie field of metal surface preparation and more particularly, to a method and a composition of anodizing magnesium and magnesium alloys and producing conductive layers on an anodized surface.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The light weight and strength of magnesium and magnesium alloys makes products fashioned therefore highly desirable for use in manufacturing critical components of, for example, aircraft, terrestrial vehicles and electronic devices. One of the most significant disadvantages of magnesium and magnesium alloys is corrosion. Exposure to the elements causes magnesitim and magnesium alloy surfaces to corrode rather quickly, corrosion that is both unesthetic and reduces strength.<br>
There are many methods for improving the corrosion resistance of a magnesium and magnesium alloy workpiece by modifying the surface of the workpiece. It is generally accepted that the best corrosion resistance for magnesium and magnesium alloy surfaces is achieved by anodization. In anodization, a metal workpiece is used as an anode of an electrical circuit, the circuit including an electrolyte bath in which the workpiece is inmiersed. Depending on the properties of the current, bath temperature and the composition of the electrolyte bath, the surface of the workpiece is modified in various ways. Various solutions ind additives are foimd in, for example: U.S. 4,023,986 (trihalogenated compound and a n-oup lb, 2, 3a, 4b, 5b, 6b and 8 metal and an alkarylamine); U.S. 4,184,926 (alkali metal ;ihcate and alkali metal hydroxide solution); U.S. 4,551,211 (aluminate and alkali hydroxide md boron/sulfate/phenol/iodine solution); U.S. 4,620,904 (basic silicate and hydroxide and luoride solution); U.S. 4,978,432 (basic pH with borate/sulfonate, [ phosphate and luoride/chloride solution); U.S. 5,264,113 (basic pH with fluoride solution followed by basic vith hydroxide, fluoride and silicate solution); U.S. 5,470,664 (neutral NH4F solution bllowed by basic hydroxide and fluoride/fluorosilicate and silicate solution); U.S. 5,792,335<br><br>
(ammonia and phosphate solution with optional ammonium salts and optional peroxides); and U.S. 6,280J98 (various amines/ammonia and phosphate/fluoride with optional sealing agents).<br>
Although anodization is effective in increasing corrosion resistance and the hardness of the surface, anodization is not perfect.<br>
Anodized magnesium surface become very rough, with many pores caused by sparking during the anodization procedure. These pores trap humidity and other corrosion-inducing agents. Upon exposure to extreme conditions, humidity is trapped in the pores, leading to corrosion. The use of ammonia or amine in the solutions taught in U.S. 5.792-335 and U.S. 6.280.598 apparently reduces the extent of sparking, leading to smaller pores.<br>
An additional disadvantage is that an anodized surface is electronically insulating. Thus anodization cannot be used in applications where an electrically conductive workpiece is desired. Applications where the strength and light weight of magnesium are desired, but require corrosion resistance and conductivity include portable communications, space exploration and naval applications.<br>
One possible solution is an innovative silane coating described in a copending patent application by the same inventor of the present invention, described in U.S. provisional patent application 60/301,147. A solution including a sulfane silane, such as bis-triethoxysilylpropyl tetrasulfane is used to coat an unanodized conductive surface. The silane layer coats the surface, preventing contact with humidity, preventing corrosion. Further, since the silane layer is so thin, the break-through voltage is very low so the workpiece is effectively conductive. Despite the remarkable corrosion resistance of a surface treated using the solution, the corrosion resistance is less than that of some anodized surfaces. In a location where the silane coated surface is repeatedly rubbed or abraded, the silane layer is worn away, exposing untreated surface to the elements, leading to corrosion. Lastly, unlike anodization, the silane laver does not increase the hardness of the surface.<br>
In the art, a number of methods for depositing a conductive layer on magnesium and magnesium alloys are known. Many methods involve the direct application of a nickel layer onto a magnesium surface. Best known is the electroless nickel method where using a multistage electroless process a nickel layer is applied to a copper layer applied to a zinc layer applied to a magnesium workpiece (shorthand: Ni / Cu / Zn / Mg sandwich). Although highly effective in producing a hard, corrosion resistant and conductive workpiece, the method is<br><br>
expensive and is environmentally damaging due to the extensive use of poisonous cyanide compounds.<br>
Ingram &amp; Glass Ltd. (Surrey, United Kingdom) provide an electroless method of applying a NJ / Zn / Mg sandwich. Although conductive and hard, a workpiece so treated corrodes rather easily. Since the nickel and zinc layers are porous, humidity penetrates to the magnesium surface and leads to galvanic corrosion.<br>
ATOTECH (Rock Hill, SC, USA) and Enthone-OMI (Foxborough, MA, USA) provide the intensive etching of a magnesium surface with fluorides solutions followed by the electroless application of a conductive nickel layer on the resulting magnesium fluoride (MgF) layer. Although conductive, corrosion resistance is poor. Further, the etching steps damage the surface, especially of die-cast parts, and are thus unsuitable for high-precision workpieces. The ATOTECH method further uses highly toxic and environmentally dangerous chromates.<br>
In addition to the above-discussed disadvantages, all the methods are suitable for application only to an entire workpiece. It is difficult, using the teachings kno\vn in the art to fashion a magnesium or magnesium alloy workpiece having a surface where selected areas are conductive whereas the other areas are not conductive.<br>
It would be highly advantageous to have a method for treating magnesium or magnesium alloy surfaces so as to have high corrosion resistance and hard yet conductive surface. Further, it is preferable that such a treatment be selective, that is that after treatment only selected areas of a surface are conductive.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is of a method of anodizing a magnesium surface in an anodizing solution of the present invention and also of a method of coating an anodized layer using a nickel solution of the present invention so as to produce a corrosion resistant yet conductive coating.<br><br>
The principles and use of the method of the present invention may be better understood with reference to the accompanying description. Before turning to details of the present invention, it should be appreciated that the present invention provides two sets of features, each of which may be used alone, or which may be combined to provide a particularly useful method.<br>
The first feature relates to an innovative method of anodizing magnesium surfaces. The second feature relates to a conductive coating for anodized surfaces and a method for applying the same. The surfaces can thereafter be treated with the silane solution of copending patent application by the same inventor, described herein and in U.S. provisional patent apphcation 60/301,147.<br>
Anodizing process for metal surfaces, in particular magnesium and magnesium alloys<br><br>
The anodizing method of the present invention involves immersing a workpiece having a magnesium surface in an anodizing solution of the present invention and allowing the surface to act as an anode of an electrical circuit. Applied through the circuit is a DC (direct current) or a pulsed DC current. .<br>
As is clear to one skilled in the art, it is necessary to control the potential of current during the anodization process. If the potential is very low, no anodization occurs. In contrast. a high potential leads to excessive heating of the workpiece. Experiments show that effective anodization begins at a minimum of about 50V, Above about 500V heating of the workpiece is intense. As a guideline, a potential from about 90V to about 200V has been found to be suitable for anodization according to the method of the present invention.<br>
Also clear to one skilled in the art is the necessity to control the current density during an anodization process. When using the solution of the present invention, it has been found that there exist two regimes of current density. When the current density is low, e.g. less than about 4 A / dm , no sparking occurs. When the current density is high, e.g. higher than about 4 A / dm2, sparking is observed.<br>
In general, when magnesium surfaces are anodized according to the methods known in the art, sparking occurs. The sparking forms large pores on the anodized surface, rendering the surface susceptible to corrosion and for some applications, unesthetic. In contrast, when the anodization of the present invention is performed using a current density in the sparking regime (greater than 4 A / dm ), pores are very small. The layer is relatively thick {e.g. 20 micron after 15 minutes).<br><br>
A surface treated using a current density in the non-sparking regime is thinner {e.g. 4 micron after 5 minutes) but very dense with pores even smaller than in the sparking regime. Such a surface is very corrosion resistant and suitable for use as a pretreatment for E-coating. Further, the lower current density is less wasteful of electrical power and thus economical and friendly to the environment.<br>
Since the electrical parameters of the anodization process are dependent on many factors including the exact composition of the bath, the shape of the bath and the size and shape of the workpiece itself, the exact details of the electrical current are not generally critical to the present invention and are easily determined, without undue experimentation, by one skilled in the art perfomiing anodization as described herein.<br>
Cojiiposition of an anodizing sohifion of (he present invention<br>
An anodization solution of the present invention is an aqueous solution made up of at least the following four components: a. hydroxylamine; b. phosphate anions: c, surfactant and d. alkali metal hydroxide.<br><br>
Hydroxylamine is readily available pure or as a phosphate salt. Since the presence of phosphate is necessary in an anodizing solution of the present invention {vide infra) and since the phosphate salt of hydroxylamine is comparatively easy to transport, store and use. the phosphate salt is preferred.<br>
b.	The anodization solution contains any amount of phosphate anion, preferably added as<br>
water-soluble phosphate salt, most preferably selected from NH4H2PO4, (NH4)2HP04j<br>
NaH2P04 orNa2HP04 , but preferably between 0.001 - 1.0 M.<br>
c.	The anodization solution contains any amount of a nonionic surfactant, such as a<br>
polyoxyalkyl ether, preferably a polyoxyethylene ether, more preferably selected from<br>
amongst a polyoxyethylene oleyl ether, polyoxyethylene cetyl ether, polyoxyethylene stearyl<br><br>
ether, polyoxyethylene dodecyl ether, and most preferably poJyoxyethy]ejie(IO) oleyl ether (sold commercially as Brij® 97). The amount of Brij® 97 added is preferably 20 to 1000 ppm, more preferably 100 to 900 ppm, even more preferably 150 to 700 ppm, and most preferably 200 to 600 ppm. When a surfactant other than Brij® 97 is added, an equivalent molar amount to that described above is preferred.<br>
d. the anodization solution of the present invention is basic, preferably having a pH above 8, more preferably above 9 and even more preferably above 10. Since magnesium can corrode at basic pHs, and as is clear to one skilled in the art does not corrode at all at a pH of greater than 12, the pH of the anodization solution of the present invention is most preferably above 12. Since hydroxylamine is naturally basic while the phosphate compounds used in * formulating the solution are naturally acidic, the pH of the anodization solution of the present invention is not clearly defined ^vithout the addition of further base. Thus it is necessary to add a base to control the pH of the solution and to ensure that it is of the desired value.<br>
Although many bases may be used lo ensure that the pH of the anodization solution is of the desired value, KOH or NaOH are prefeiTed. Of the two, KOH is more preferred. Experiments have shown that the sodium and potassium ions are integrated into the anodized layers of the present invention. Although not wishing to be held to any one theory, it is believed that the presence of the sodium and potassium ions in an anodized layer of the present contribute to the exceptionally properties of the layer, especially hardness and corrosion resistance. It has been found that anodization solutions with potassium ions generally give better results. To get these results, a minimum of 0.5M alkali metal hydroxide. It has been experimentally observed that assuming that the desired pH is achieved, concentrations of greater than 2M alkali metal hydroxide are not desirable as the conductivity of the solution is reduced to the point where excessive heating of the workpiece is observed.<br>
Phosphate Content<br>
The exact phosphate content in an anodizing solution of the present invention influences the surface properties achieved.<br>
High phosphate content solution<br>
A high phosphate content solution of the present invention preferably has phosphate concentration of between about 0.05 and about 1.0 M phosphate, more preferably between<br><br>
about 0.1 and about 0.4 M and even more preferably between about 0.1 and about 0.4 M phosphate.<br>
When a high phosphate content solution is used, it is necessajy to control the solution temperature, by cooling, during anodization. The temperature of the solution during anodization preferably does not exceed about 30°C, and more preferably does not exceed about 25°C.<br>
When a high phosphate content solution of the present invention is used, a relatively thick (15 to 40 micron) and harder anodized layer is attained. Apart from magnesium, a high phosphate content solution of the present invention is useful for anodizing surfaces containing aluminum, beryllium and alloys. In some cases the added expense of cooling the solution renders the use of a high phosphate content unattractive.<br>
Low phosphate content solution<br>
A low-phosphate content solution of the present invention typically has a phosphate concentration of less than 0.05 M. The produced anodized layer is relatively thin {e.g. 10 micron) and very smooth, making an attractive finish. Apart from magnesiun:i, a low phosphate content solution is useful for anodizing surfaces containing titanium and alloys.<br>
It has been found most convenient, for reasons of process simplicity and costs, to add phosphate as hydroxylamine phosphate. The amount of phosphate so added is sufficient for producing an effective anodized layer. It is important to note, however, that some phosphate must be present in an anodizing solution of the present invention. Inadequate results are achieved if no phosphate at all is present.<br>
When a low phosphate content solution is used, it is not necessary to control the solution temperature during anodization. The temperature of the solution has been experimentally found to rise to temperature up to 60°C without negatively effecting the produced layer.<br>
Although there are similarities between the anodizing solution of the present invention and the anodizing solution taught in U.S. 6,280,598, the anodizing solution of the present invention is quite different.<br>
In the solution of the present invention, hydroxylamine is used instead of ammonia or alkyl and aryl amines of U.S. 6,280,598. Further, whereas in U.S. 6,280,598 it is explicitly stated that the use of alkali hydroxide salts is not preferred in a solution of the present invention the use of alkali metal hydroxides, especially NaOH and KOH is required.<br><br>
Thus, in contrast to the teachings of U.S. 6,280,598 where the occurrence of sparldng during anodization is discouraged, when using a solution of the present invention the occurrence of sparking is one of many parameters that may be adjusted. The unique composition of the anodization solution of the present invention allows creation of an excellent anodized layer even under sparking conditions.<br>
Further, as stated above, the addition of sodium ions and, even more so, potassium ions to the anodization solution of the present invention give anodization layers with preferable properties.<br>
Conductive coating for anodized metal surfaces<br>
Anodization according to the method of the present invention produces an exceptionally good anodized surface that has few very small pores, making the anodized layer of the present invention exceptionally wear and corrosion resistant. However, like other anodizing methods, the anodized layer produced is an electrical insulator.<br>
The second feature of the present invention is a method for rendering an anodized metal surface, especially an anodized magnesium or magnesium alloy surface, conductive by applying to the anodized surface a nickel solution of the present invention. Although application of the nickel solution of the present invention can be used to treat and thus render conductive any anodized layer formed in a basic anodizing solution, the solution is exceptionally suited for use with the anodized layer of the present invention.<br>
When applying the nickel solution to an anodized surface according to the method of the present invention, not only is the treated area rendered conductive, but the nickel containing layer conducts electricity tlurough the anodized layer into the bulk of the workpiece. Thus the nickel solution of the present invention can be used to treat only areas of a surface. For example, a magnesium cylinder can be fashioned as a wire where the entire cylinder (sides and end) is anodized to be corrosion resistant but the two ends are also treated with a nickel solution of the present invention. The sides of the cylinder are insulated, but electrical current can flow from one end of the cylinder to the other.<br>
The four necessary components of the nickel solution of the present invention are a. bivalent nickel cations (N2+; b. pyrophosphate anions (PaOy4+; c. hypophosphite anion (PH2O2"). and d. ammonium thiocyanate (NH1SCN) or lead nitrate (PbNOs) in an aqueous solution.<br><br>
The preferred amounts of the four components of the solution are:<br>
a.	Any amount of Ni2+ is used, for example as NiSOa or NiCl2, but<br>
preferably between	0.0065 M and 0.65 M;<br>
more preferably between	0.0026 M and 0.48 M;<br>
tYcn more preferably between	0.032 M and 0.39 M;<br>
and most preferably between	0.054 M and 0.32 M;<br>
b.	Any amount of pyrophosphate is used, for example as Na4P207 or K4P207,biit<br>
preferably between	0.004 M and 0.75 M;<br>
more preferably between	0.02 M and 0.66 M;<br>
even more preferably between	0.07 M and 0.56 M;<br>
and most preferably between	0.09 M and 0.38 M;<br>
c.	Any amount of hypophosphite anion is used, for example as sodium hypophosphile or<br>
pottasium hypophosphite, but<br>
preferably between	0.02 M and 1.7 M;<br>
more preferably between	0.06 M and 1.1 M;<br>
even more preferably between	0.09 M and 0.85 M;<br>
and most preferably between	0.11 M and 0.57 M;<br>
d.	.Any amount of ammonium thiocyanate is used but<br>
preferably between	0.05 ppm and 1000 ppm;<br>
more preferably between	0.1 ppm and 500 ppm;<br>
even more preferably between	0.1 ppm and 50 ppm;<br>
and most preferably between	0.5 ppm and 10 ppm.<br>
When lead nitrate is used in the stead of ammonium thiocyanate, a molar amount equivalent to the amount of ammonium thiocyanate described hereinabove is preferably added.<br>
The pH of a nickel solution of the present mvention is preferably above 7, more preferably above 8, and even more preferable between 9 and 14. If necessary, a base, especially NH4OH, is added to adjust the pH of the nickel solution to the desired value.<br>
The nickel solution of the present invention is applied to the surface of the workpiece at an elevated temperature between 30°C and 96°C, more preferably between 50°C and 95°C, even more preferably between 70°C and 90°C preferably for between 30 and 60 minutes.<br><br>
Although a nickel solution of the present invention can be applied by dipping, sprayincr, wiping or brushing it is clear that dipping in a heated bath is the most economical and easiest to control method of application. After removal from the nickel solution, the surface is washed with excess water.<br>
Partially conductive anodized surfaces<br>
As stated hereinabove, it is possible to apply the nickel solution of the present invention to only selected areas of an anodized surface. Where the nickel solution is applied to an anodized surface, as described hereinabove, the anodized layer is penetrated by a nickel containing layer making a conductive channel from the anodized surface into the bulk of the workpiece. If desired the conductive layer can be applied in a complex pattern. Although there are many ways known to one skilled in the art for applying a solution such as the nickel solution of the present invention to only selected areas of a surface, it is clear that most advantageously a mask is applied (for example by printing methods) onto areas to be protected from contact with the nickel solution prior to application of the nickel solution. The nickel solution of the present invention is subsequently applied to the surface of the workpiece. After removal of the mask, the surface has conductive areas (where the nickel solution made contact with the anodized surface) and insulating areas (where the anodized surface was protected from contact with the nickel solution). Suitable materials for use as masks must adequately adhere to the anodized surface at the elevated temperatures used. MICROSHIELD STOP-OFF® Lacquer, conunercially available from Structure Probe, Inc. (West Chester, PA, USA) is one example of a suitable masking material<br>
Sulfane silane coating.<br>
After anodizing and/or after treating with a nickel solution of the present invention as described hereinabove it is advantageous to treat a surface with the silane sealing solution of the present invention described fully in the copending patent application by the same inventor, described in U.S. provisional patent application 60/301,147.<br>
The sealing solution of the present invention is a sulfane silane solution, preferably a bis-triethoxysilylpropyl tetrasulfane solution. Upon application to a surface, the silane effectively attaches to the treated surface including the internal surfaces of pores. The silane surface is so water-repellant that water applied to a treated surface is observed to bead and run-off of the surface. Without wishing to be held to any one theory, apparently the silane<br><br>
surface prevents contact with a metal surface and prevents entry of water into pores, preventing corrosion. Although it is likely that the silane layer on exposed parts of a surface that are subjected to wear or abrasion is removed, the silane remains in the pores. As is known to one skilled in the art, corrosion is often initiated by water trapped within pores on a magnesium surface.<br>
Use of the silane solution as described herein above prevents the appearance of galvanic corrosion. It is clear that the potential difference between magnesium and nickel promotes galvanic corrosion. Application of a silane layer according to the method of the present invention is water repellent, helping prevent galvanic corrosion.<br>
When the silane solution of the present invention is prepared it is first necessary to hydrolyze the silane. Due to the slow rate of hydrolysis in water, sulfane silanes such as bis-triethoxysilylpropyl tetrasulfane are preferably hydrolyzed in a separate step in an acidic solution. Hydrolysis can be performed, for example, in a solution composed of 5 parts silane, 4 parts water and 1 part glacial acetic acid for 3 to 4 hours. Typically, even after 4 hours the solution is cloudy, indicating that not all of the silane is in solution or hydrolyzed.<br>
After hydrolysis, the solution containing the hydrolyzed silane is diluted with a water/organic solvent solution so that the final solution has between 70% and 100% organic solvent, more preferably between 90% and 99% organic solvent.<br>
The organic solvent used is a solvent that is miscible with water, and is most preferably an edcohol such as methanol or ethanoL or such solvents as acetone, ethers, or ethyl acetate.<br>
The sealing solution has a pH between 4 and 8, preferably between 5 and 7.5, and most preferably between 6 and 7. The pH is most preferably adjusted using an inorganic base, preferably NaOH, KOH, NH4OH, and most preferably NaOH or NH4OH.<br>
Treatment of a surface of the present invention using a sealing solution, such as the solution described hereinabove, is preferably done by dipping, spraying, wiping or brushing. After removal from the solution, the surface is drip, blow or air-dried.<br>
