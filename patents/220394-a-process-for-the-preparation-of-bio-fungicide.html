FIELD OF IHVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a process for preparation of a bio-fungicide for protection against nursery diseases in mulberry plants.<br>
BACKGROUND OF INVENTION<br>
The diseases namely, stem-canker fit die-back {Botryodiplodia (=Lasiodiplodia) theobromae}, collor-rot (Phoma sorghina/P. mororum) and cutting-rot (Fusarium solani), which are commonly known as nursery diseases, cause severe losses to mulberry plantation by affecting its initial establishment in nurseries as well as in main fields.<br>
There is no alternative bio-product available for the management of these nursery diseases. The method is available only for the control of one of the nursery diseases i.e., stem-canker, that is the use of a chemical fungicide, Bavitin (Carbendazim 50% WP i.e., Methyl-2-benzimidazole carbamte). However, chemical control is more expensive and short term effective, besides being ecologically unsafe and farmers' unwillingness in the use of chemical fungicide due to the apprehensions about its toxicity on silkworms.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
An object of this invention is to propose a process for preparation of a bio-fungicide for an effective management of nursery diseases, such as stem-canker, die-back, collor-rot and cutting-rot in mulberry.<br><br>
Another object of this invention is to propose a process for preparation of a bio-fungicide, which is ecofriendly and cost effective and has effective application for mulberry plant.<br>
Still another object of this invention is to propose a process for preparation of a bio-fungicide, which provides a high survival and growth of mulberry saplings for better and uniform establishment and growth of mulberry plantation, which ensures the high quality leaf yield and ultimately the silk production.<br>
Yet another object of this invention is to propose a process for preparation of a bio- fungicide, which does not contain any hazadous chemical, and thereof, the use therefore is ecologically safe, as it does not cause any sort of environmental hazard and provides healthy leaves for silkworm feeding.<br>
A further object of this invention is to propose a process for preparation of a bio-fungicide, which kills the pathogens in soil and thus makes the soil disease-suppressive, and remains active in soil for very long period, as it grows on organic matter present in soil.<br>
A still further object of this invention is to propose a process for preparation of a bio-fungicide, which stimulates the plant growth and vigour, thus, improves leaf yield and quality for healthy silkworm rearing.<br>
STATEMENT OF INVENTION<br>
According to this invention, there is provided a process for preparation of a bio-fungicide for protection against nursery diseases in mulberry plants wherein the process comprises inoculating of Lignite-Molasses-Wheat bran mixture with an isolate of fungal biocontrol agent Trichoderma pseudokordngii, incubating at 28± 4°C for 12-14 days, harvesting the materials, diying at room temperature followed by mild blending to break lumps, wherein said Lignite-Molasses-Wheat bran mixture is prepared by impregnating 15% v/v molasses solution, having pH of 5.5± 2 and containing 3g/! of each of KNO3 and KH2PO4, with heat sterilized powdered lignite for 15-20 hours at 80-100% solution, mixing thorughly impregnated lignite thus obtained with wheat bran at 5-8g per lOOg of said powdered lignite wherein further said powdered lignite contains fixed carbon and ash with calorific value of 2600-2800 K Cal/kg.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION<br>
According to this invention there is provided a process for the preparation of a bio-fungicide which comprises in growing T.pseudokoningii on lignite-Molasses-Wheat bran mixture for 12-14 days, harvesting of material and drying and finally blending just to break the clumps.<br><br>
This invention provides a process for the preparation of biofungicide, using a potential biocontrol agent, Trichoderma pseudokonmgil This process comprises the mass - ^^ multiplication of T.pseudoionmgii through a fermentation process using a carier-substrate comprising powdered Lignite-MolasseS'Wheat bran. In such a process, T.psejMiokoningji is directly grown on a carrier of powdered lignite containing ilxed carbon and ash with calorific value of 2600-2800 K cal/kg impregnated with (pH 5.5 ±2) Molasses solution containing KNO3 and KH3PO4. The advantage of this solid f»Tneotation procedure is that it avwds the chances of contamination as happens in case of liquid-mediun? fermentation<br>
Thus, in acawdance with this invention. Molasses solution is mixed with heat stylized powd«-ed lignite at a rate of 80-100% and left for impr^nation for 15-20 hours. The Wheat bran is mixed wiih impregnated lignite, for example 5-8 g/100 g of dry wt. equivalent of powdered Lignite. Tpseiddoixmingii is grown on this Hgnite-Molasses-Wheat bran mixture for J 2-J 4 days, then the material is harvested from contain^s and kept for room drying. After drying, it (s blended mildly in a mixer to break the clumps The dried powdered mat^ial is then packed in bags, sealed and stored in dark or refugerator. Tlw product initially contains the population of trichoderma pseudokonin^i of about 10' CFU/g. Its shelf life is six months under darkness at room temperature (28± 4°C) and 9-10 months under regrigeration (4°C)<br>
In the present invention, an indigenous isolate of Trichoderma psendokoningii was isolated from the soil of mulberry gardens, The selection of this isolate of T.pseiidokoningii as potential biocontrol agent was made after thorough in-vitro and in-vivo screttiing of a number of isolates of different microbi^ agents against the pathogens<br><br>
causing serious nursery diseases in mulberr)'. Following the observations on the potential effect of T.pneudokoningii isolate against mulberry nursery pathogens and diseases, it was prepared in the form of a biofiingicide<br>
The fungicide was tested in the fields pre-inoculated with the pathogens causing nursery diseases and also in the fields naturally infested with the nursery diseases. The product was tested in the Institute's garden as well as in the farms of regional research stations and extension centers situated at various locations The product was mixed thoroughly with well decomposed farm-yard manure (FYM) in a ratio of 1; 60 kg, moistened v^th water, in case of less moisture in FYM; and stored for a week under shade for suitable establishment of biocontrol agent with FYM The activated fungicide+ FYM mixture was broadcasted in nursery beds @ 2 kg/m^ and incorporated to the soil by light digging, or forking The stem-cuttings were then planted in treated beds, followed by usual irrigation. In case of direct plantation in the main field, the activated mixture of fungicide + FYM was applied in planting pits @ 50 gram per pit before plantation of stem-cuttings. It controlled the nursery diseases at the institute's garden by 51.4%, which resulted in an increase of 33 8% in saplings/plant survivability, besides improving plant growth by 31,0%. The product was also tested in integration with a compatible fungicide Mancozeb 75% WP @ 0 1% concentration. This integration provided disease control of 69.8%, resulting in an increase of 45 9% in saplings/plant survivability, besides improving plant growth by 59,5% The fungicide tested in integration with Mancozeb as a technology, controlled diseases ranging from 34,5 to 818%, depending upon the incidence &amp; severity of the nursery diseases (Table 1A &amp; B)<br>
Table 1: Evaluation of fungicide of the present invention for the management of nursery diseases (Stem-canker, die-back, collar-rot and cutting-rot)<br><br><br><br>
The fungicide also has wide scope for its use in controlling the root-rot disease of mulberry caused by Hotryodiplodia thenhromae. which is of late emerging as serious threat to mulberry cultivation Apart from it. it can also be used effectively for the control of stem-canker and die-back diseases of plantation crops like pear, mango, rose, etc., those are caused by Botryodiplfxiia theohromae, Phoma species and Fusarium solani.<br><br><br>
