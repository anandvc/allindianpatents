The present invention relates to a vehicular bumper mainly used for an automobile,<br>
FIG. 8 is a perspective view showing the whole of a vehicular front bumper, FIG. 9 is a partially perspective view showing a state in which a fog lamp is installed to another front bumper, FIG- 10 is a sectional view taken along the line A-A of FIG, 8, FIG. 11 is a sectional view taken along the line B-B of FIG. 8, FIG. 12 is a sectional view taken along the line C-C of FIG, 9, and FIG, 13 is a sectional view taken along the line A-A of FIG. 8, in which a fog lamp is installed. Concerning the installation of a fog lamp, the conventional vehicular bumpers include a bumper in which a mounting boss 2 is projectingly provided on the back surface of a bumper body 1 as shown in FIG. 10, a bumper in which a character line 3 is put on the surface side at a location where the boss 2 is projectingly provided as shown in FIGS. 11 and 12, a bumper in which a pedestal 4 shown in FIG. 13 formed by molding by use of a slide mold is provided at the root of the boss 2 to prevent a dent, and the boss 2 is projectingly provided on the pedestal 4, and a bumper in which a stay 5 for supporting a fog lamp 6 is interposed as shown in FIG- 13, and the fog lamp 6 is installed by fixing the stay 5 by means of a screw 2a threaded into the<br><br>
boss 2-<br>
Concerning the installation to a fender, for the conventional vehicular bumper, the bumper body 1 is fixed to a fender 7 by threading a screw 9 into a nut 8 while aligning with a position of the nut 8 fixed to a hole 7a on the side of the fender 7 as shown in FIGS. 14 and 15. The longitudinal position of the bumper body 1 is regulated by putting a protrusion 11 provided on the fender 7 into a V-shaped notch 12 on the side of the bumper body 1. The bumper is fixed to a vehicle body 10 by using a bumper stay 13, a plurality of screws 14 threaded into the bumper stay 13, and a screw 16 threadedly engaging with a nut 15 fixed to the side of the bumper body 1. Thus, the rigidity is enhanced, the position is stabilized, and the parting dimension with respect to the fender 7 is made accurate.<br>
However, concerning the installation of the fog lamp, a dent 17 occurs easily on the surface side of the bumper body 1 when only the boss 2 is projectingly provided. Also, even if the pedestal 4 formed by molding by use of a slide mold is provided, the dent 17 cannot be prevented completely- Even if the character line 3 is put, it is difficult to put the character line 3 at all locations of the boss 2, so that the dent 17 cannot be prevented completely. The fog lamp 6 is fixed to the bumper body 1 only, and is not fixed to the vehicle body 10. For a large fog lamp  6, therefore, there is the possibility of<br><br>
breaking the boss 2. In addition, the bumper body 1 is deflected downward by the gravity of the fog lamp 6, so that there arises a problem in that a parting dimension S with respect to a headlamp 18 cannot be obtained-<br>
Also, for the bumper in which the fog lamp 6 is installed to the stay 5, since the fog lamp 6 is not assembled directly to the bumper body 1, the accuracy of installation position of the fog lamp 6 is decreased by the accuracy of the stay 5 and the variations in the assembly of the stay 5. Further, the bumper has a problem in that the shape on the lower side of the headlamp 18 provides a poor rigidity, an end portion lb is deformed easily, and a parting portion with respect to the headlamp 18 waves as shown in FIG. 16, resulting in bad appearance.<br>
On the other hand, concerning the installation to the fender, accurate positioning cannot be performed because of a low rigidity of the protrusion 11, and the protrusion 11 sometimes cannot be installed for the reason of design. Also, when the structure in which the protrusion 11 is put into the V-shaped notch 12 cannot be used, there is the possibility that the bumper moves with a hole la on the bumper side being the center. In particular, when a longitudinal dimension L of the fender 7 shown in PIG- 14 is long, the parting dimension between the fender 7 and the bumper becomes inaccurate. Further, since the structure in which the protrusion 11 is put into the V-<br><br>
shaped notch 12 provides a large clearance to enhance the assembling property, there is looseness, so that the position cannot be regulated exactly-<br>
OBJECT   AND   STTMMARY  OF   THE   INVENTTON<br>
The present invention has been made to solve the problems with the conventional vehicular bumper, and accordingly an object thereof is to provide a vehicular bumper in which a dent is surely prevented from being produced on the bumper surface, the rigidity of bumper and the assembling property are increased, and the installing accuracy is enhanced.<br>
To achieve the above object, the present invention provides a vehicular bumper in which a downward rib is provided downward from a bumper body on the back face side of the bumper body, and the downward rib is provided with a lamp mounting boss projecting in the longitudinal direction. Also, in the present invention, the downward rib may be placed on a support rib projecting from the lamp side and be supported by it- Also, the downward rib can be molded by using a slide mold in the widest possible range, and can be provided on the bumper body over a wide range in the width direction of vehicle. Further, the present invention provides a vehicular bumper having a connecting portion connected to a fender, the connecting portion being installed to a receiving portion of the fender by being lapped, characterized in that the connecting portion is projectingly provided with a positioning protrusion at a<br><br>
location corresponding to a positioning hole formed in the receiving portion, and the positioning protrusion is inserted into the positioning hole so as to be non-rotatable, by which the vehicular bumper is positioned. A spot facing face that is depressed with respect to the surface of the connecting portion may be formed around the root of the positioning protrusion, the positioning hole may have a square shape, and the positioning protrusion may be tapered.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTTON OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
A vehicular bumper in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention will be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings, talcing a front bumper as an example.<br>
FIG. 1 is a perspective view showing the whole of a vehicular front bumper in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, FIG. 2 is a sectional view taken along the line E-E of FIG. 1, and FIG- 3 is a sectional view taken along the line F-F of FIG- 1. For a front bumper 20, a bumper body 21 integrally has a front plate portion 22, a curved plate portion 23 extending upward and rearward from the upper end of the front plate portion 22, and an upper plate portion 24 extending from the rear end of the curved plate portion 23. A downward rib 25 is provided at the rear end of the upper plate portion 24 at the top end of the bumper body 21, and the downward rib 25 is projectingly provided with a lamp mounting boss 26 that faces rearward in the longitudinal direction-<br>
The front bumper 20 has a connecting portion 27, which is connected to a receiving portion 32 of a fender 31 by being lapped, on both sides, right and left. As shown in FIG. 4, the connecting portion 27 of the front bumper 20 is projectingly provided with a positioning protrusion 28 upward at a position corresponding to a positioning hole 33 formed in the receiving portion 32 of the fender 31 so that positioning is performed<br><br>
by inserting the positioning protrusion 28 into the positioning hole 33. Around the root of the positioning protrusion 28 is formed a spot facing face 29 that is depressed with respect to the surface of the connecting portion 27- The positioning hole 33 of the fender 31 is square in shape, and on the other hand, the positioning protrusion 28 of the front bumper 20 is tapered, so that the front bumper 20 is positioned and installed in such a manner that the front bumper 20 cannot move longitudinally and transversely in a state in which the positioning protrusion 28 is inserted in the positioning hole 33 so as to be non-rotatable.<br>
The aforementioned elements are disposed on the front bumper 20 symmetrically with respect to the vehicle centerline. The front bumper 20 is installed to a vehicle body 10 by means of screws (not shown) at a plurality of places between the right and left connecting portions 27. As shown in FIG. 2, a front end portion of a front hood 19 is located above the front bumper 20, and a headlamp 18 is arranged at a predetermined position so as to be close to the front bumper 20.<br>
The downward rib 25 of the front bumper 20, which projects downward by being molded by use of a slide mold, is arranged on the back surface side of the bumper body 21, and is continuous in the width direction of vehicle with a uniform cross section. As shown in FIG. 3, the downward rib 25 is projectingly provided with the lamp mounting boss 26 that faces rearward. By<br><br>
threading the screw 30 into the boss 26, a fog lamp 6 is installed via a stay 35. The boss 26 is reinforced by a small rib 26a. The downward rib 25 is placed on a support rib 38 projecting forward from a lamp housing 37 on the side of the headlamp 18, and is supported by the support rib 38, The downward rib 25 is molded by using a slide mold in the widest possible range,<br>
FIG. 4 is a perspective view of a principal portion showing a state before the connecting portion is connected to the receiving portion of the fender, and FIG, 5 is a sectional view showing a state after connection. The connecting portion 27 has a connecting protrusion 40, which is projectingly provided inward in the width direction of vehicle, at the right and left upper end of the bumper body 21, and the connecting protrusion 40 is provided with the positioning protrusion 28 projecting upward. At a portion of the connecting protrusion 40 at the rear of the positioning protrusion 28 is formed an engagement hole 41. The positioning protrusion 28 projects upward from the center of the spot facing face 29 formed on the top surface of the connecting protrusion 40 as shown in FIG. 5.<br>
As shown in FIG, 6, the positioning protrusion 28 has a transversely positioning portion 44 of a hexagonal shape similar to the shape of a piece for Japanese chess, and longitudinally positioning portions 45, 45 of a triangular shape in cross section projecting from both surfaces of the transversely positioning portion 44, The positioning<br><br>
protrusion 28 is positioned by bringing tapered faces 44a, 44a of the transversely positioning portion 44 and tapered faces 45a, 45a of the longitudinally positioning portions 45 into contact with opposing hole edges of the positioning hole 33 in the state in which the positioning protrusion 28 is inserted in a square positioning hole 33 formed in the receiving portion 32 of the fender 31.<br>
For the bumper 20 of this type, the fog lamp 6 is installed by bringing the tip end of the stay 35 projecting from a support member 47 of the fog lamp 6 into contact with the tip end of the boss 26 projecting from the rib 25, and by threading the screw 30 into the boss 26 in the state in which a tip end bent portion 48a of a fog lamp bezel 48 is hooked to the front plate portion 22. The bumper 20 is positioned in the transverse and longitudinal directions by Inserting the positioning protrusion 28 into the positioning hole 33 on the side of the fender 31. Also, the bumper 20 is installed to the vehicle body 10 by threading a screw into a nut, which is the same as the nut 8 shown in FIG- 14, fixed to a receiving hole 31a on the side of the fender 31 and fastening the screw, and by threading the screws at other predetermined places.<br>
According to the front bumper in accordance with the above-described embodiment of the present invention, the boss 26 is projectingly provided on the rib 25 arranged on the back surface side of the bumper body 21, Since the boss 26 is located<br><br>
at a position independent of the surface of the bumper body 21, a problem is not presented even if a dent is produced - Therefore, the boss 26 can be added, or a radius R can be increased by rounding the root of the boss 26 in place of the small ribs 26a as shown in FIG. 7. This means has an advantage that the boss 26 is prevented from being folded and the rigidity of Installation can be enhanced-<br>
The downwardly extending rib 25 increases the rigidity of bumper body 21, prevents waving as shown in PIG- 16, and prevents hanging of the bumper body 21 caused by the deflection near the lower part of the headlamp 18. Also, since the rib 25 is placed on the support rib 38 projecting from the lamp housing 37 on the side of the headlamp 18, the hanging of the bumper body 21 caused by the deflection near the lower part of the headlamp 18 can be decreased further.<br>
The present invention is not limited to the above-described embodiment, and various changes and modifications can be made. For example, the present invention can be applied to not only the front bumper 20 but also a rear bumper. Also, the shape of the positioning hole 33 may be polygonal such as octagonal or hexagonal, and the shape of the positioning protrusion 28 can also be changed to a shape suitable to the positioning hole 33.<br>
In the present invention, a downward rib is provided downward from a bumper body on the back face side of the bumper<br><br>
body, and the downward rib is provided with a lamp mounting boss projecting in the longitudinal direction. This configuration increases the rigidity of the bumper body, prevents waving of the bumper, and does not pose a problem even if a dent is produced at the portion of rib from which the boss is projected. Therefore, effects can be achieved that the boss can be added or the root thereof can be thickened, the rigidity of boss can be increased, and the rigidity of the lamp installing structure can be enhanced. Also, since the downward rib is placed on a support rib projecting from the lamp side and is supported by it, the deflection of the bumper body can be restrained. Since the downward rib is molded by using a slide mold in the widest possible range, and is provided on the bumper body over a wide range in the width direction of vehicle, the rigidity of the bumper body can further be increased. Further, the connecting portion connected to a fender is projectingly provided with a positioning protrusion at a location corresponding to a positioning hole formed in the receiving portion, and the positioning protrusion is inserted into the positioning hole so as to be non-rotatable, by which the vehicular bumper is positioned. Thereby, not only the bumper can be positioned in the longitudinal direction, but also the rotational movement with the hole of bumper being the center can be restrained by tightening of one place only. Still further, a spot facing face that is depressed with respect to the surface of the connecting<br><br>
portion is formed around the root of the positioning protrusion, the positioning hole has a square shape, and the positioning protrusion is tapered• Therefore, the radius for rounding the root of the positioning protrusion is increased without interference with the positioning hole on the fender side, so that the rigidity of positioning protrusion can be increased, the adjustment of position can be made easily, and the assembling property can be enhanced.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
