				<td>A NOVEL ORGANO SILICONS POLYMER ANTIFOAM AND A PROCESS FOR ITS MANUFACTURE<br>
2. WACKER METROARK CHEMICALS LIMITED, D H Road. Mouja Chandi, PS Bishnupur. 24 Parganas (South), State of West Bengal. PIN - 743 503, India, an Indian company<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed. <br>
A NOVEL ORGANO SILICONE POLYMER ANTIFOAM AND A PROCESS FOR<br>
ITS MANUFACTURE<br>
The present invention relates to a novel organo polysiloxane compound, its preparation and use.<br>
In the dyeing machine for the dyeing of polyester fabric or polyester-cotton or cotton, conventional activated silicone emulsion is in use as an antifoaming agent for controlling foam that affects uniform dyeing on the fabric. In the next step, the dyed fabric is finished where softening agents like cationic softener, amino silicone softener or other softener or mixture of these are used in the padding bath and subsequently drying and curing of the fabric is carried out followed by passing the fabric through stentor.<br>
The use of antifoaming agent is thus an essential ingredient in the dyeing process because during the dyeing process, foam causes inconsistent coloration. It is known to use dynamic silicone antifoam in the dyeing process because dynamic silicone antifoam is stable at high temperature, as well it doesn't impart any stain at high temperature.<br>
However, due to high price of dynamic silicone antifoam, mills generally prefer to use normal silicone antifoam in the dyeing process. Since the normal silicone antifoam is not stable at 60°C and above, it separates and gradually deposits inside the wall of the dyeing machine. After 10 to 15 no. of dyeing, silicone deposition is enough in the machine which start to impart stain in the fabric.   Therefore, to avoid such disadvantages of staining, mills use dark coloured fabric          to take on stain. Therefore, due to the non-availability of moderately priced silicone antifoam which could avoid the problem of staining of fabric during dyeing, mills<br>
usually prefer to use normal siltcone antifoam to keep down the cost and avoid   the problems of staining to the extent possible using dark coloured fabrics.<br>
After dyeing, fabrics go to padding for finishing stage where softening of the dyed fabric using finishing chemicals is effected. For this purpose, systems like cationic softener or amino silicone emulsion or mixture of amino silicone emuision  and <br>
2<br>
cationic softener is applied through padding mandrel and finally cured and dried in stentor at about 130°C to 150°C. Padding step is also a remarkable cost involving process-involving manpower, huge energy etc.<br>
The invention has for its object provide a new organo-silicone polymer which would be effective as an antifoaming agent for dyeing of fabrics and the like, would be cost-effective and also avoid the problems of staining of fabrics during dyeing.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a novel organo silicone polymer which would be cost-effective and would essentially avoid the problems of deposition of silicone oil in the walls of the dyeing machine to favour stainfree dyeing of fabrics in a cost effective manner to meet the demands of mills.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a novel organo silicone polymer useful as an antifoaming agent in dyeing process which would favour stain free dyeing with favourable fabric characteristics to facilitate the subsequent stages of processing / treatments of fabrics and like to obtain finished products.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a process of manufacture of the novel organo silicone polymer for use as antifoaming agent and stain free dyeing of fabrics with improved fabric characteristics.<br>
Yet further object is to provide an improved process of dyeing and processing of fabrics and the like using the novel organo silicone which would make processing of fabrics in mills and the like, simple and cost-effective.<br>

Example-5 (without catalyst)<br>
2000 gm silanol terminated polydimethylsiloxane having viscosity 80 cps and 2000 gm ??? EO ( ethylene oxide) modified polysiloxane ( Wacker IM 22) were reacted in the reactor under nitrogen purging. 70 gm ?-Aminoethylaminopropyl Methyl Dimethoxy Silane was added in the reactor under nitrogen purging and continue the reaction for about 6 hr at   120°C.  Temperature  was  gradually<br>
13<br>
increased to 150°C and kept at that temperature for 1 hr to deactivate the catalyst. Distilled out the volatile at 150°C under 5 mm Hg pressure. No volatile was found as a distillate. Cool down the reactor and fluid from the reactor was taken out. A white immiscible fluid was found. 50 gm fluid was centrifuse at 3000 rpm for 10 min. We found a clear separation in the centrifuge tube where top layer was PDM and bottom layer IM22. Therefore, no volatile was due to no reaction taken place in absence of catalyst. Here, all the inputs are non volatile and generally volatile is generated during equilibrium reaction in presence of catalyst and as reaction goes on, feed mixture become more and more clear.<br>
So, it is clear, catalyst presence in the reaction mixture is the must for the reaction.<br>
Emulsions were obtained using the polymer of Examples 1,2,3 and 4 above as detailed under TABLE I.<br>
The series of Emulsions in TABLE I were made using same emulsifiers with and without the polymer of the invention.<br>

The antifoaming and other related characteristics of the above emulsions of the invention having the novel polymer (Examples E4 and E5), other polymers without carbonyl group (Examples 1 and 2) and the emulsion E1 and E6 without incorporation of the novel polymer were tried each on 1200 M polyester fabric in jet-dyeing machine.<br>
Process :<br>
Protocol followed as hereunder :<br>
First, 500 Kg DM water introduced into the jet dyeing machine through a metering pump. After desizing and scouring, raw fabric loaded in the Jet-dye machine. Temperature inside liquid of the machine raised to 80°C and added dispersing dye, dispersing agent, EDTA into the machine from the feeding tank where all these chemicals pre-diluted with hot water. Machine was run for ten minutes with fabrics and allowed for thorough mixing of the dye with other ingredients. pH of the liquid was adjusted to 5 by acetic acid. 1 Kg E 2 emulsion of the invention was pre-diluted in feed in with 30 Kg water and feed to the machine. All flanges in the machine were then closely tied and temperature in the machine was raised to 120°C under high speed rotary movement of the fabric in the machine. Pressure inside the machine was maintained to 2.5-3 Kg/cm2. The total run was continued for 45 min and then the liquid inside the machine was cooled to 60°C. Drained the liquid inside the machine and took out fabric from the machine. Fabric was then cured at 100-110°C in a 20M stentor having temperature 100°C.<br>
Similarly, the same fabric treatment was done with E1, E3, E4, E5 and E6 emulsion of in the same machine.<br>
The antifoam characteristics of the emulsions of the E2, E3, E4, E5 and the conventional emulsions (E1 and E6) and fabric characteristics achieved in use of such emulsions in dying process were studied and the results are represented in accompanying Figures 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9.<br>
15<br>
From the above Figures (graphs), it is clear that silicone polymer emulsion of F2. E3. E4 and E5 using the polymer of the present invention showed comparable antifoam characteristics as that of conventional emulsion F6 but the emulsions E2, E3, E4 and E5 impart comparable softness to standard amino emulsion E1. We also observed emulsions of novel polymer E4 and E5 did not impart any unwanted stains on the fabric while the emulsions E1, E2, E3 and E6 caused substantial stains on the fabric.<br>
Notably, the fabric finish/quality achieved in use of emulsions having polymer of the novel invention (E 4 and E5) during dyeing was also found to be superior as would be evident from the data revealing gloss and softness characteristics of the treated fabrics<br>
Importantly, the above exemplary processes further reveal that use of the polymer emulsion of the invention as an antifoam agent during dyeing can apart from avoiding the staining of fabrics provide for favourable beneficial characteristics in the fabric for subsequent processing and/or finishing of fabrics.<br>
Thus the novel antifoam polymers of the invention which is about 30% less expensive than the dynamic silicon antifoam but favour stain free dyeing of fabrics simultaneously softening of the fabric is directed to make the processing of fabrics simple and cost-effective without affecting quality and character of the fabrics.<br>
