				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to a method and apparatus with which the aqueous<br>
solution from liquid-liquid extraction in the hydrometallurgical recovery of<br>
metals is purified from droplets of organic extraction solution.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The hydrometallurgical recovery of metals often comprises the following<br>
stages: the leaching of a concentrate or ore, liquid-liquid extraction and the<br>
precipitation or reduction of the metal. Leaching may be bioleaching or dilute<br>
acid leaching, from which the aqueous solution is routed to liquid-liquid<br>
extraction. In extraction, organic extraction solution is mixed, in an extraction<br>
cell (mixer-settler) or in a column, into an aqueous solution that contains a<br>
metal, usually in ion form or as a compound along with several impurities.<br>
The valuable metal to be refined reacts selectively with the organic extraction<br>
solution, whereby it is separated from the aqueous solution into the<br>
extraction chemical in a pure form. The aqueous solution depleted of<br>
valuable metals, i.e. the raffinate, is routed back to concentrate/ore leaching.<br>
The valuable metal or substance bound to the extractant can then be<br>
separated from the organic solution back into an aqueous solution (stripping)<br>
with the inverted chemical reaction to extraction, and can then be recovered<br>
again from there as a product, for instance by precipitation or reduction to<br>
metal. Reduction may be electrolysis for example.<br>
The extraction process is thus the mixing together of liquids that are<br>
physically insoluble in each other into droplets or a dispersion in the mixing<br>
section of the extraction apparatus, and after chemical mass transfer, the<br>
droplets in the dispersion are made to coalesce back into the original layers<br>
of liquid in the settling section or settler. Intensive mixing or a significant<br>
change in the surface chemistry conditions of the process may result in very<br><br>
small droplets, which require a lot of time to disengage to their own liquid<br>
phase. These droplets do not necessarily have time to disengage in the<br>
actual settling section of the extraction step, but move further along the<br>
process with the other phase.<br>
The entrainment of extraction solution in process stages occurring in the<br>
aqueous phase such as leaching or electrolysis (electrowinning) causes<br>
process disturbances. Bioleaching is particularly susceptible to disruption,<br>
because organic extraction solution is toxic to the bacteria that maintain<br>
bioleaching. In addition, the purity of metal produced by electrowinning<br>
suffers from the extraction solution that accumulates in the electrolysis tanks.<br>
Therefore, electrolyte that enters electrolysis must also be purified carefully<br>
from droplets of extractant. A maximum of only 3-5 ppm extraction solution is<br>
permitted in the electrolyte.<br>
For example, in the hydrometallurgical recovery of copper, a mixer-settler<br>
apparatuses are used which are principally laid out horizontally. Their<br>
operation has improved in recent years to the extent that the amount of<br>
extraction solution entrained in the aqueous solution is in the range of about<br>
10 ppm. However, it has been found that the permanent reduction of the<br>
amount of entrained droplets below 5 ppm cannot be accomplished using<br>
only a mixer-settler apparatus.<br>
The separation of small droplets from another solution occurs using the<br>
droplet coalescence principle. When droplets are made larger, they can be<br>
separated from another solution due to the effect of gravity. There are<br>
several types of droplet coalescers, for instance plate coalescers, fibre/mesh<br>
coalescers, packed bed coalescers and membrane coalescers.<br>
Nowadays, for instance, a kind of packed bed organic droplet coalescing<br>
device, which is in fact a pressure filter, such as the one described in US<br>
patent publication 6,015,502 is used for purifying the electrolyte. A filler such<br><br>
as anthracite is used in the pressure filter to bind the droplets. The filler is<br>
regenerative at regular intervals, so that its pores do not get clogged too<br>
much with organic solution. In practice, several devices connected in parallel<br>
are required for purification, for example four to six units in a large copper<br>
extraction facility. The apparatus is expensive and its operating features are<br>
complicated. Since the flow direction of solution has to be changed from time<br>
to time, this results in the fact that solutions from different operating stages<br>
are mixed together disadvantageously. At the same time, some of the<br>
electrolyte and extraction solution is also lost.<br>
The amount of raffinate, the stream of aqueous solution from the extraction<br>
stage that is routed back to leaching, is considerably greater than the amount<br>
of electrolyte in contact with organic solution in the stripping stage. Even if<br>
the apparatus described in US patent 6,015,502 were used to purify<br>
electrolyte, its use in raffinate purification would not be economically viable in<br>
practice. Tanks to purify the raffinate are proposed, into which slotted plates<br>
are placed according to various embodiments. The distance between the<br>
plates is usually over 10 mm and when the size of the droplets of extraction<br>
solution is less than 50 microns, the cleaning effect generally remains<br>
modest, far less than half the amount of extraction solution contained in the<br>
raffinate.<br>
PURPOSE OF THE INVENTION<br>
The purpose of the method and apparatus of the invention is to treat the<br>
aqueous solution exiting the hydrometallurgical liquid-liquid extraction of<br>
metals by performing the physical separation of extraction solution droplets<br>
from the aqueous solution in a simple and economical way. The aqueous<br>
solution may be either one exiting stripping that contains valuable metals or a<br>
raffinate exiting extraction itself, which is depleted of the valuable substance.<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The characteristic features of the invention will be made apparent in the<br>
attached claims.<br>
In the method according to the invention the aqueous solution exiting liquid-<br>
liquid extraction occurring during the hydrometallurgical recovery of metals is<br>
treated in a after-settler type of settling tank, where it is made to flow from<br>
the feed end of the tank towards the rear end. The aqueous solution is made<br>
to flow through a flow channel area with a reduced cross-section that ex-<br>
tends over the width of the tank at least at one point. The flow channels are<br>
located in the lower section of the droplet coalescer according to the inven-<br>
tion, with the upper section of the device being mainly solid. In the droplet<br>
coalescer zone the aqueous solution is made to flow through flow channels,<br>
which have a cross-sectional area of 10-25% of the total cross-sectional area<br>
of the solution depth, i.e. the tank area from the bottom to the liquid level.<br>
Flow channels are grouped so as to be overlapping and inclined obliquely<br>
downwards in the direction of flow. The depth of the flow channels is in the<br>
region of 2-6 mm, preferably 3-5 mm. The majority of the solution flow is<br>
laminar, but the upper part of the flow channel is suitable for forming a swirl,<br>
which makes the droplets of extraction solution collide with each other and<br>
thus form larger droplets. The surfaces of the flow channels are roughened<br>
and/or otherwise shaped to create swirls. The shaping also causes slowing<br>
down the movement of the droplets of extraction solution and thereby their<br>
collisions. The depth of the roughening is in the region of 0-3-1.0 mm and/or<br>
the depth of the shaping is in the region of 2-3 mm. The large drops formed<br>
rise upwards from the aqueous solution by the effect of gravity and combine<br>
on the surface of the settling tank to form a layer of extraction solution.<br>
The extraction solution that has already disengaged from the aqueous<br>
solution is routed to flow onwards via guide channels located in the upper<br>
section of the droplet coalescer. In this way the organic solution does not mix<br><br>
into the aqueous solution again. The guide channels are located above each<br>
other and are pointed upwards in the direction of flow of the solution. The<br>
number of guide channels is 1/6-1/3 of the number of flow channels.<br>
In addition to flow channels, the settling tank may be equipped with at least<br>
one device that diverts the flow vertically upwards from the bottom.<br>
Preferably the number of turning elements is the same as the number of<br>
droplet coalescing devices. By means of the turning elements the direction of<br>
the flow of aqueous solution is diverted at intervals from horizontal to vertical,<br>
which helps the droplets of organic solution to separate. The turning element<br>
allows the flow to be diverted across the entire width of the settling tank.<br>
According to the invention, the apparatus intended for settling an aqueous<br>
solution from the hydrometallurgical liquid-liquid extraction of metals<br>
comprises an essentially rectangular settling tank, which is made up of a<br>
feed end and a rear end, sidewalls and a bottom.<br>
A minimum of one droplet coalescing device is situated in the settling tank in<br>
the direction of flow. The droplet coalescer is arranged to be essentially in an<br>
upright position and it extends from one side of the tank to the other. The<br>
device consists of several adjacent elements, which extend from the bottom<br>
of the tank to above the surface of the liquid. The elements are mainly solid,<br>
but their lower section is equipped with flow plates with a roughened and/or<br>
shaped surface, directed obliquely downwards from the direction of flow.<br>
Almost the whole solution stream is directed via the flow channels formed<br>
between the flow platens. The flow plates are located at a distance which<br>
corresponds to 10-25% of the height of the droplet coalescer.<br>
According to one embodiment of the invention, the profiling of the flow plates<br>
is formed of rounded protrusions on the surface of the plate. The height of<br>
the rounded protrusions may be in the region of 2 - 3 mm. Preferably the<br>
upper surface of the plate is provided with protrusions and the lower surface<br><br>
is roughened, so that the upper surface of the actual flow channel is<br>
roughened and the lower surface provided with protrusions. Both surfaces of<br>
the plate may also be roughened. The roughening is in the region of 0.3 -1<br>
mm. In addition the whole plate may be made undulating.<br>
Some guide plates are located in the upper section of the droplet coalescer.<br>
The thin layer of organic extraction solution that has separated onto the<br>
surface of the aqueous solution is made to flow via the guide plates located<br>
in the upper section of the device. The number of guide plates is 1/6-1/3 that<br>
of the flow plates. The guide plates are like the flow plates in shape.<br>
According to one embodiment of the invention, the settling tank is provided<br>
after the droplet coalescer with solid turning elements directed upwards from<br>
the bottom. The turning element changes the direction of the solution stream<br>
from the flow channel zone from horizontal to almost vertical and at the same<br>
time achieves the coalescence of the small droplets. The height of the<br>
vertical plates is 30 - 50% of the total depth of solution in the tank.<br>
According to one embodiment of the invention, the aqueous solution to be<br>
purified is brought to the lower section of the settling tank via a feed pipe,<br>
from which it is distributed into the tank via several feed units directed<br>
towards the front corner of the tank. The feed pipe preferably forms part of a<br>
baffle, which is situated between the front wall of the tank and the first droplet<br>
coalescer.<br>
According to one embodiment of the invention, the purified aqueous solution<br>
is removed from the rear of the tank via several suction units, which are<br>
directed to suck out the solution from the rear corner of the tank. The pure<br>
aqueous solution is collected from the suction units in a collecting pipe and<br>
routed to the following process stage, which is for example leaching or metal<br>
recovery.<br><br>
According to the invention the extraction solution that has accumulated on<br>
the surface of the aqueous solution is removed from the rear section of the<br>
tank as the overflow and its recovery is specified to be larger than the layer<br>
of extraction solution formed during settling. The amount of surface solution<br>
to be removed is preferably in the range of 10-50%, preferably 25-35% of the<br>
amount of aqueous solution fed into the tank.<br>
According to one embodiment of the invention, the bottom of the settler is<br>
inclined, getting deeper towards the rear. The slope of the bottom is<br>
preferably 2 - 8 degrees to the horizontal.<br>
The purification of the aqueous solution in liquid-liquid extraction processes<br>
is not limited to the extraction process of any particular metal. The method<br>
and apparatus described above are, however, well suited when the valuable<br>
substance to be recovered is copper.	<br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Figure 1 shows how a settling tank according to the invention is connected to<br>
the rest of the extraction process. The extraction process in the diagram<br>
includes extraction steps E1, E2 and E3, organic solution settler LO, one<br><br>
1	*■<br>
washing stage W and the stripping step S. In this connection two aqueous<br>
solution settling tanks are now drawn. Tank 1A is intended for the aqueous<br>
solution which comes from the stripping step and includes a valuable metal.<br>
Tank 1B is intended for the raffinate coming from extraction, which has<br>
released its valuable metal and is circulated back to concentrate or ore<br>
leaching.<br>
Figure 2 shows a settler 1 according to the invention in more detail. Aqueous<br>
solution is fed into the tank through a distribution pipe 2 and the feed units 3<br>
in it to the vicinity of the feed end 4 and the bottom 5. The upper edge of the<br>
tank is marked with number 6. It is preferable to feed the aqueous solution<br>
diagonally downwards towards the front corner. The feed pipe is preferably<br>
part of the vertical plate 7 that divides the feed end. The horizontal upper<br>
edge 8 of the vertical plate 7 is at a depth of 30 - 50% of the effective depth<br>
of the tank.<br>
The size of the droplets of extraction solution is made to grow by means of a<br>
droplet coalescing device 9, of which there is at least one placed in the<br>
settler for that purpose. In the settling tank in Figure 2 there are three<br>
devices, and this can be varied according to need between 1 and 5. Each<br>
device 9 extends from one side of the settler to the other and in practice is<br>
made up of several cassettes placed side by side. The length of the device in<br>
the direction of flow is 0.1 - 1 m, preferably 0.3-0.7 m. The device is solid in<br>
the middle 10 and the flow plate cassette 11 that actually increases the<br>
droplet size is located in the lower section of the device. Each cassette is<br>
made up of several flow plates placed on top of each other, between which<br>
flow channels are formed. The droplet coalescer forms a dense flow barrier<br>
in the tank, so that the entire flow of aqueous solution takes place via the<br>
flow channels. The flow plates are positioned at a distance from each other<br>
of 2-6 mm in elevation. The flow plates are angled diagonally downwards in<br>
the direction of flow at an angle of 10 - 45 degrees, preferably at 15 - 30<br>
degrees to the bottom 5.<br><br>
The number of flow channels and flow plates is chosen so that the flow in the<br>
channels is largely laminar. When the viscosity of the aqueous solution is for<br>
instance in the range of 0.7 - 3 cP, it is preferable to keep the flow rate<br>
around 0.05-0.20 m/s.<br>
The droplet coalescing device extends above the surface of the liquid 12 in<br>
the settler. Situated in the upper section of the device, below the surface of<br>
the liquid, there are several guide plates forming a connecting channel<br>
cassette 13, via which the extraction solution concentrated in the surface<br>
layer is made to move forwards in the tank evenly. The guide plates forming<br>
the connecting channel are basically the same type as the flow plates in the<br>
bottom of the device. The connecting channel plates, however, when seen in<br>
the direction of flow, are inclined upwards at an angle of 5 - 25 degrees. The<br>
number of connecting channel guide plates is far less than that of the flow<br>
plates, so that there are 1/6 - 1/3 of the number of flow plates. The flow rate<br>
of the organic solution in the connecting channel is dimensioned to be<br>
essentially the same as that of the aqueous solution in the flow channels.<br>
The surfaces of both the flow plates and the guide plates are roughened or<br>
otherwise shaped so that there is a roughening of around 0.3 -1.0 mm in<br>
height in their surface and/or a shaping of 2-3 mm high. In particular, the<br>
lower surface of the flow plate, that is, the surface that forms the upper<br>
surface of the flow channel is preferably shaped so that it causes a slight<br>
mixing motion. The movement of the droplets of organic solution that are<br>
slowly separating upwards is slowed by the effect of the shaped surface and<br>
they stick partially to the shaped surface, particularly if it is roughened. The<br>
droplets collide with each other on such surfaces and combine into bigger<br>
drops. As the size of the drops increases, the flow detaches the drops and<br>
on exiting the flow channels, they have grown to such a size that as a result<br>
of buoyancy they rise more quickly towards the surface of the settling tank.<br><br>
The settling tank can further be equipped with a turning element 14 located<br>
after the droplet coalescer. The elements extend from one side of the tank to<br>
the other and are solid. They are located in relation to the droplet coalescers<br>
so that they are slightly nearer the previous coalescer in the direction of flow<br>
than they are to the following one. The upper edge of the turning element<br>
extends to a height from the bottom, which is a maximum of half of the depth<br>
of liquid in the tank. The number of turning elements is preferably the same<br>
as the number of droplet coalescing devices.<br>
The droplet coalescer are grouped in the settler so that the proportion of the<br>
feed space before the first device is 15-25% of the length of the tank and the<br>
proportion of the rear space after the last device 25-40%. Between the last<br>
droplet coalescer and the back wall 15 of the settler there remains a space,<br>
which is 2-4 times longer than the space between the devices in the tank.<br>
After the final coalescer and the turning element, the entrained droplets of<br>
extraction solution in the aqueous solution have grown to such an extent that<br>
they almost all rise to the surface in the rear space of the settler at the latest,<br>
which is 25-40% of the total tank length. The surface layer containing organic<br>
extraction solution flows over the essentially horizontal overflow edge 17 of<br>
the discharge launder 16 that extends over the entire tank. The solution is<br>
removed from the launder via unit 18 and is routed to some suitable mixer.<br>
The bottom layer containing pure aqueous solution is sucked out through<br>
several suction units 19 near the bottom and rear wall. The suction units are<br>
directed towards the bottom and rear end of the tank. The aqueous solution<br>
is conducted from the suction units via one or several collector pipes 20 on to<br>
the next stage. When one collector pipe is in use, it extends across the entire<br>
rear space of the tank. According to one embodiment of the invention, two<br>
collector pipes are used, of which each extends into its own section of the<br>
rear space of the settler. It is however also advantageous that all the<br>
aqueous solution is recovered from the same side of the tank, so that one<br><br>
collector pipe extends across the entire width of the tank, even though its<br>
suction zone is only part of the tank.<br>
When more solution is collected in the organic solution discharge launder<br>
than what is required for the layer of extraction solution that has accumulated<br>
on the surface, the amount of entrained droplets of extraction solution in the<br>
aqueous solution is reduced at the same time. When the amount of solution<br>
to be taken from the bottom is decreased in relation to the amount of solution<br>
fed into the settler, the proportion of the surface layer can be increased,<br>
since it corresponds to the difference of the solution fed and the aqueous<br>
solution removed.<br>
As shown in Figure 2, the bottom 5 of the settler may be inclined towards the<br>
rear space, becoming deeper. The slope of the bottom may be in the range <br>
of 2 - 8 degrees to the horizontal.<br>
Figure 3 shows a partial three-dimensional view of the flow plate cassette 11<br>
composed of the flow plates 21 of the droplet coalescer device 9.<br>
Figures 4A and 4B show the upper and lower surfaces of a flow plate of one<br>
droplet coalescer. In Figure 4A, protrusions 22 have been formed on the<br>
surface of flow plate 21 at regular intervals, which deflect the flow and help<br>
the small droplets to combine with each other. The protrusions in the drawing<br>
are circular, which achieves a smooth flow. Preferably the protrusions cover<br>
10-50% of the surface of the plate. According to one embodiment, the<br>
surface of the plate is also slightly undulating, which achieves a vertical<br>
change in direction for the advancing streams. Figure 4B shows the<br>
roughened surface of one flow plate, of which the beneficial effects are<br>
described above.<br><br>
The invention is not restricted only to the embodiments presented above but<br>
modifications and combinations of them are possible within the framework of<br>
the concept of the invention included in the patent claims.<br><br>
