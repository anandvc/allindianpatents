				<td>Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a process for preparing oral 2-methyl-thieno<br>
benzodiazepine formulation hereinafter referred to as olanzapine, and process for the<br>
preparation thereof.<br>
Background and prior art<br>
Olanzapine, has shown great promise in the treatment<br>
of psychotic patients and is currently being evaluated for<br>
that purpose. Certain tablet formulations of olanzapine are<br>
known, as described in U.S. Patent No. 5,229,382. However,<br>
improved oral formulations were desired in light of the<br>
moisture sensitive, metastable nature of olanzapine, the<br>
tendency of olanzapine to undesirably discolor in the Known<br>
tablet formulation, and due to the surprisingly potent, nature<br>
of olanzapine.<br>

the group consisting of hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose.<br><br>
hydroxyethyl cellulose, methylhydroxyethylcellulose, sodium<br>
carboxymethylcellulose , hydroxypropylcellulose;<br>
pyrrolidone, dimethylaminoethyl methacrylatemethylacry<br>
acid ester copolymer, ethylacrylate-methylmethacrylate<br>
copolymer, methylcellulose, and echylcellulose. comprised of<br>
using a high shear aqueous wet granulation with fluid bed<br>
drying process.<br>
Detailed Description<br>
Olanzapine, a potent compound showing promising<br>
activity for use in treating psychotic patients,<br>
metastable, undergo pharmaceutically undesired discoloration,<br>
and demands care to assure homogeniety of the finished solid<br>
formulation.<br>
Applicants have discovered that<br>
certain excipients including powder blends. Further the<br>
discoloration is exacerbated by ambient, air conditions<br>
elevated temperatures, and by moist. <br>
Although the discoloration phenomenon does not<br>
produce an increase in the number of total related<br>
substance, the browning and mottling appearance is not<br>
generally considered pharmaceutically acceptable for<br>
porticularly disturbing when a tablet<br>
administered to a psychotic patient, which patient may be<br>
especially troubled by the changing appearance<br>
medication.<br>
Applicants have discovered that coating the solid<br>
oral formulation with a polymer selected from the group<br>
consisting of hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose, hydroxy<br>
carboxymethylcellulose , hydroxypropylcellulose,<br><br>
in the formulation. The formulation is most: preferredly<br>
tablet form; however, granule formulation and the like are<br>
desired as well.<br>
Most preferred polymer coats are hydroxypropyl<br>
methyl cellulose, hydroxypropylcellulose, methylcelluiose,<br>
and ethylcellulose. An especially preferred polymer coat is<br>
hydroxypropyl methylcelluiose.<br>
It is especially preferred that the formulation<br>
contain the most stable anhydrous form of olanzapine,<br>
referred to herein as Form II; however, other forms of<br>
olanzapine are contemplated. Form II has a typical x-ray<br>
powder diffraction pattern as represented by the following<br>
interplanar spacings<br><br><br><br>
A typical example of an x-ray diffraction pattern<br>
for Form II is as follows wherein d represents the<br>
interplanar spacing and I/I1 represents the typical relative<br>
intensities:<br><br><br><br>
The x-ray diffraction patterns set out herein were<br>
of tabled using a Siemens D5000 x-ray powder, diflractometed<br>
having a copper Kα radiation source of wavelength,<br>
The formulation of the invention preferredly<br>
contains substantially pure Form II as the active ingredient- .<br>
As used herein "substantially pure" refers to Farm<br>
associaced with less than about 5% undesired polymorphic<br>
form of olanzapine therein referred to as "Undesired Form"<br>
preferably less than ,about 2% Undesired Form, and more<br>
preferably less than about 1% Undesired Form. Further,<br>
"substantially pure" Form II will contain less than about<br>
undesired chemical impurities or residual solvent<br>
water. In particular, "substantially pure" Form II<br>
contain less than about 0.05% content of<br>
more preferably, less than about 0.0059<br><br>
of acetonitrile. Additionally, Form II preferredly contain<br>
less than 0.5% of associated water.<br>
As used herein, the term "mammal" shall refer to<br>
the Mammalia class of higher vertebrates. The term "mammal<br>
includes, but" is not- limited to, a human. The term<br>
"treating" as used herein includes prophylaxis of the named<br>
condition or amelioration or elimination of the condition<br>
once it has been established.<br>
Form II is the most stable anhydrous form of<br>
olanzapine known and is therefore important for the<br>
commercial development of pharmaceutically elegant<br>
formulations. Olanzapine may form an undesired crystal<br>
form in the presence of certain solvents and excipients,<br>
therefore, in making the compositions of the invention it<br>
is most desired to prepare the formulation using a method<br>
which does not require dissolution of the olanzapine<br>
substance. The desired Form II can be converted to less<br>
desirable polymorphic forms by contact with methylene<br>
chloride, for example. Additionally, for example,<br>
'i<br>
polyethylene glycol contact with the olanzapine substance<br>
produces undesir.ed discoloration, particularly under moist<br>
conditions.<br>
Applicants believe that a dry blend direct<br>
compression proc'ess or dry granulated processes for<br>
preparing solid oral formulations create a greater chance<br>
that poor dose uniformity will occur. In light of the<br>
potent nature of olanzapine, consistent dose uniformity is<br>
imperitive. In accordance with this invention, Applicants<br>
have discovered that a high shear aqueous wet granulation<br>
with fluid bed drying is the most effective method for<br>
preparing pharmaceutically elegant, stable, oral<br>
formulations.<br>
Uncoated tablets stored at ambient conditions<br>
(approximately 23°C and 40% relative humidity) in amber,<br>
high density polyethylene bottles do not show signs of<br>
discoloration after 24 months; however, if the bottle<br><br>
opened such chat the tablets are exposed to open<br>
ambient conditions then discoloration occurs within 5 days<br>
A new solid oral formulation was prepared un-<br>
used a hydroxypropropyl methylcellulose subcoating and<br>
white color coating. The new formulation did not discolor<br>
after 90 days of open dish storage at 40°C, 60°C, 40°C.<br>
%RH, ambient temperature with 75% RH, or at ambient,<br>
temperature with 85% RH. The hydroxypropyl methylcellulose<br>
coating which is free of polyethylene glycol is much<br>
preferred to ensure that discoloration does not occur on<br>
the tablet surface. It provides an effective barrier<br>
between the white color coat which provides an acceptable<br>
medium for imprinting and color dressing ot the product.<br>
The hydroxypropylmethylcellulose coating provides<br>
sufficient barrier to prevent discoloration attribute<br>
the polyethylene glycol in the white color coat.<br>
Alternative white film coat formulas containing alter<br>
plasticizers were evaluated; however, none were<br>
prevent discoloration in all test conditions after<br>
of storage. Therefore, the hydroxypropy 1 methyl<br>
coat or subcoating is a surprising and important component<br>
of pharmaceutically elegant solid oral formulations of<br>
olanzapine.<br>
A diluent or bulking agent should be selected<br>
provide an increase in tablet size. The artisan can<br>
utilize known methods to select a bulking agent whir!,<br>
provides hardness, friability, and disintegration time<br>
is satisfactory for pharmaceutical usage. The bulking<br>
agent should be selected to provide a tablet that has<br>
characterstics desired by the patient as well as comply<br>
with applicable regulatory guidelines.<br>
One lespecially preferred diluent or bulking<br>
agent is lactose. Various forms of lactose are<br>
for such formulations including anhydrous, hydrous<br><br>
spray dried forms. The most desired form of lactase<br>
selected based on desired dissolution, content<br>
hardness, friability, and disintegration time.<br><br>
artisan is aware; of the regulatory requirements for<br>
hardness, friability, and disintegration time and can<br>
adjust the diluent or bulking agents using known techniques.<br>
i<br>
to achieve the desired physical characteristics.<br>
The formulation should include a binder for use<br>
in the granulation step. The artisan can choose an<br>
appropriate binder based on the acceptable viscosity, and<br>
desired hydration. Hydroxypropyl cellulose is especially<br>
preferred for use as a binder in the granulation step. The<br>
hydroxypropyl cellulose may vary in particle size. Fine<br>
grade hydroxypropyl cellulose is especially preferred for<br>
most claimed formulations.<br>
The desired formulation includes a disintegrant.<br>
for use in the granulation as well as in the running<br>
powders to facilitate the disintegration process. There<br>
are a variety of grades available, and the grade may de-<br>
selected based on the acceptable batch variability. A<br>
particularly prefered disintegrant is crospovidone. A fine<br>
grade of crospovidone provides particularly desirable<br>
consistency between batches.<br>
The artisan may choose appropriate dry<br>
using known methods. Such binders should be selected to<br>
assure that satisfactory friability is attained. Most<br>
preferably, dry binder is microcrystalline cellulose;<br>
however, other appropriate dry binders may be selected.<br>
Such microcrystalline cellulose may be in a granular<br>
The artisan can choose an appropriate<br>
to prevent sticking and picking of the tablets to the<br>
compression tooling. One preferred lubricant is<br>
stearate.<br>
The artisan can readily choose other<br>
aqueous dispersion film coats (color mix) for<br>
over the hydroxypropyl methylcellulose layer.<br>
The color mixture is a dry blend of ingredients<br>
be dispersed in water and used as an aqueous dispersion<br>
film coat solid formulations. One example of a typical<br>
color mixture is comprised of hydroxypropyl<br><br>
methylcellulose, polyethylene glycol, polysorbate 80, and<br>
titianium dioxide.<br>
A variety of edible inks known to the artisan<br>
are appropriate for imprinting the finished formulation<br>
For example, one typical edible ink is comprised of<br>
shellac, ehtyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol, n-butyl<br>
propylene glycol, ammonium hydroxide, and FD&amp;C Blue.<br>
The solid formulation is most preferably<br>
subcoated with hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, coated with a<br>
color coat, and imprinted with an edible ink. The solid<br>
formulation may be polished using standard methods such is<br>
carnauba wax polishing, if desired.<br>
Olanzapine is effective over a wide dosage<br>
range, the actual dose administered being dependent on the<br>
condition being treated. For example, in the treatment of<br>
adult humans, dosages of from about 0.25 to 50 mg,<br>
preferably from 1 to 30 mg, and most preferably 1 to 20 mg<br>
per day may be used A once a day dosage is normally<br>
although divided doses may be administered.<br>
For treatment of central nervous system disorders, a dose<br>
range of from 1 to 20 mg, preferably 1 to 20 mg per day<br>
suitable. Radiolabelled Form II 2-methyl-4 -(4-methyl-1<br>
piperazinyl)-10H-thieno-[2,3-b][1,5]benzodiazepine, can be<br>
detected in the saliva and thus the compound can<br>
potentially be monitored in patients to assess compliance.<br>
A preferred formulation of the invention is a<br>
solid oral formulation comprising from about 1 to about 20<br>
:ng olanzapine as an active ingedient, wherein such solid<br>
oral formulation is coated with hydroxypropyi<br>
methylcellulose. Especially preferred is an oral<br>
formulation comprising from 1 to 20 mg of<br>
provided that such solid oral formulation is coated with<br>
hydroxypropyl methylcellulose.<br>
Most preferably, the solid oral formulation is<br>
contained in pacKaging materials which protect the<br>
formulation from moisture and light. For example, suitable<br><br>
packaging materials include amber colored high density<br>
polyethylene bottles, amber colored glass bottles, and other<br>
containers made of a material which inhibits the passage of<br>
light. Most preferably, the packaging will include a<br>
desiccant pack. The container may be sealed with an aluminium<br>
foil blister to provide the desired protection and maintaing<br>
prcduct stability.<br>
A study of the hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose<br>
coated tablets in an amber colored bottle having a<br>
pack stored at harsh, 40°C/75% RH conditions for six months<br>
showed pharmaceutically acceptable stability with a 0.4<br>
about 1.2% increase in total related substances.<br>
The materials for the present invention can be<br>
purchased or prepared by a variety of procedures well known<br>
tc those of ordinary skill in the art. Olanzapine can be<br>
prepared as desdribed by Chakrabarti in U.S. Patent No<br>
5,229,382 ('382), herein incorporated by reference in its<br>
entirety. It is most desirable to prepare a rapidly<br>
dissolving formulation comprising substantially pure<br>
crystalline Form II. Such substantially pure crysta1ine<br>
Form II olanzapine may be prepared using the techniques<br>
described herein by the Preparation section herein<br>
Compound characterization methods include, for<br>
analysis (TGA), differential scanning calorimetery<br>
titrametric analysis for water, and H1-NMR analysis for<br>
solvent content.<br>
The formulations were studied to assure that the<br>
Form II polymorph was substantially pure using<br>
polarization / magic angle spinning (CP/MAS) NMR.<br>
were obtained using a Varian Unity 400 MHz spectromer or<br>
operating at a carbon frequency of 100.577 MHz and equipped<br>
with a complete solids accessory and Varian 5 mm or mm VT<br>
CP/MAS probes. Measurement conditions were optimized for<br>
Olanzapine Form II and were as follows: 90° proton,<br>
pulse 4.5 ms, contact time 1.1 ms, pulse repetition time<br>
MAS frequency 7.0 kHz, spectral width 50 kHz, and<br><br>
time 50 ms. Chemical shifts were referenced co the<br>
i<br>
hexamethylbenzene (d = 17.3 ppm) by sample replacement<br>
was determined that the substantially pure Form II<br>
is retained throughout the formulation process claimed<br>
herein. Therefore, the formulations of this invention<br>
provide substantially pure Form II olanzapine polymorphic<br>
pharmaceutically elegant formulation without producing<br>
undesired polymorphic transformation.<br>

EXAMPLE 1<br>
A portion of the hydroxypropyl cellulose was<br>
dissolved in purified water to form a solution for<br>
granulation; The remaining hydroxypropyl cellulose (total of<br>
4.0% w/w final tablet weight), which was an extra fine grade.<br>
was combined with the olanzapine (1.18% w/w), lactose (79.32%<br>
w/w) and a portion of the crospovidone (5% w/w) in a high<br>
shear granulator. All ingredients were security sieved prior<br>
to addition and dry blended in the granulator. This mixture<br>
was then granulated with the hydroxypropyl cellulose solution<br>
in the high shear granulator. The granulation was wet sized<br>
using standard methods. The wet granulation was then dried<br>
in a fluidized bed dryer and sized. The material was then<br>
added to a tumble bin mixer.<br>
The running powders consisting of microcrystaliine cellulose<br>
(granular) (10% w/w), magnesium stearate (0.5% w/w), and the<br>
remainder of the crospovidone were added to the sized<br>
granulation. The mixture was blended and compressed with the<br>
appropriate tooling on tablet compression equipment.<br>
Hydrbxypropyl methylcellulose (10% w/w) was mixed<br>
with purified water to form a solution. Core tablets were<br>
divided into approximately equal sections and spray coated<br>
with the hydroxypropyl methylcellulose solution. The<br>
operation was performed in a perforated coating<br>
