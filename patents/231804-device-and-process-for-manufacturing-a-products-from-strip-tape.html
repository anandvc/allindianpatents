				<td> Print show and process for manufacturing a product from strip tape, especially for manufacturing a medicinal and/or active substance-containing product as well as tillable containers or sealed-margin bags<br>
The invention relates to a process for manufacturing a product from strip tape, especially a medicinal and/or active substance-containing product such as, for example, dermal or transdermal patches or another administration form, for example for oral application, as well as tillable containers or sealed-margin bags, in which process there is used as starting material a broad, active agent-containing web of material, for instance of sheet-like materials and, in particular, of active substance-containing sheeting or sheet-like active substance, said process comprising at least two of the following steps:<br>
separating the broad web of material into individual, narrow strips and, if necessary, winding the strips in individual coils or jointly twisting the strips.<br>
unwinding individual coils or pairs of coils, as required, and assembling at least two strips at a time to form a strip web, or unwinding the strip web wound up from individual strips.<br>
processing the web of material to form a product made-up of strip tape,<br>
performing final process steps as, for instance, manufacturing the final product, forming the final application form, laminating the carrier material, segregating, packaging etc.<br>
For manufacturing the above-mentioned products, strip tape consisting of a plurality of individual strips is used. This tape is made by separating a coilof the starting material into individual strips, said coil having a width resulting from the number of strips multiplied by the width of the strips plus edge trimming.<br>
Typically, the resultant strips are wound on reels and are jointly unwound in the number as required and assembled to form webs of material having at least two layers. The manufacture of the stock reels is very labour-intensive, as is the winding and unwinding of the individual strips.<br>
It is possible, here, that the material - which may be an active substance-containing material or a medicinal substance - is stretched impermissibly, with the unavoidable elongation of the material having a negative effect on the dosing accuracy of the medicinal substance.<br>
It is the object of the present invention to provide a process and a device suitable for carrying out said process which overcome the aforementioned disadvantages, diffi-culties and technical limitations, and, in particular, enable the manufacture of a strip tape product, especially preferred an active substance-containing product, at reduced expenditure in respect of work and costs and without disadvantageous elongation of the material.<br>
To achieve this object in a process of the kind mentioned at the outset, it is proposed according to the invention that a roll of material with a broad web of the starting material be mounted, loosely rotatable, on a take-up mandrel,<br>
that the web of material be drawn, in its entire width and without subjecting the material to tensile stress, from the roll of material by means of a vacuum roll,<br>
or a device comprising two rolls, which unwinds the material gently from the material roll with one of the rolls simultaneously serving as a counter support to the cutting knifes; the material being separated in the process into individual strips in the negative pressure zone of the vacuum roll by rolling a multiple circular knife roll, <br>
that at the end of the negative pressure zone of the vacuum roll or of the pair of rolls, each strip be drawn from the said vacuum roll or pair of rolls and be introduced in a take-up channel and continuously conveyed therein my means of negative pressure,<br>
that in the process each strip is turned on its way to the channel or through the channel by about 90°, and<br>
that at the end of the channels the strips be led one upon the other, at least two at a time, and thereafter conveyed in a, preferably open, groove for further processing under completion to form the final product, to a conversion equipment where the products are finished.<br>
One embodiment of the process provides that for drawing the web of material and separating it into strips in cooperation with the multiple circular knife roll, there is used instead of a vacuum roll, a smooth stripping roll cooperating in a. zone where the web of material travels around the roll with a pressure roll and a guide roll.<br>
A device for the manufacture according to the present invention of a product from strip tape, especially of a medicinal and/or active substance-containing product such as, for example, a dermal or transdermal patch or another administration form, for example for oral application, as<br>
well as tillable containers or sealed-margin bags, especially for carrying out the process according to the invention,<br>
is characterized in that:<br>
as a means for drawing off and separating the web of material a vacuum roll is provided, in whose web-travelling zone the web of material, held by the negative pressure, can be severed into individual strips in cooperation with the multiple circular knife roll,<br>
to each strip there is associated a vacuum conveyor channel which is designed such that each strip is turned on its way to the channel or through the channel by about 90°, and<br>
the ends of all the take-up channels 12 are brought together at one site to form a unit and that at that site there are provided guide means and transport means for the further transport to a conversion equipment.<br>
One embodiment of the device according to the invention provides that as means for drawing the web of material and for transport during the separation into strips in co-operation with the multiple circular knife roll, there is provided instead of a vacuum roll, a smooth stripping roll arranged in a zone where the web of material travels around the roll and adapted to cooperate with a pressure roll and a guide roll.<br>
The process according to the invention and the device provided for carrying out the same overcome the afore-mentioned disadvantages, difficulties and technical limitations of the prior art and, in particular, enable the manufacture of medicinal and/or active substance-containing<br>
products at reduced expenditure in terms of work and costs without disadvantageous elongation of the starting material.<br>
In accordance with the present invention it relates to Device for manufacturing a products from strip tape, such as a dermal or transdermal patch or another administration form for oral application, as well as fillable containers or sealed-margin bags comprising<br>
-a vacuum roll (4) which is provided for drawing off and separating the web of material (2), wherein said web of material (2) is held by negative pressure in the web-traveling zone, such that said web of material (2) can be served into individual strips (6) in cooperation with a circular knife roll (5),<br>
V<br>
characterized in that<br>
-a vacuum conveyer channel (12) is associated to each strip (6), said channel (12) being designed such that each strip (6) is turned of its way to the channel or through said channel (12) by about 90°, and<br>
the ends of all the take-up channels (12) being brought together at one site to form a unit and that there are provided guide means and transport means at that site for the further transport to a conversion equipment.<br>
In accordance with the present invention it relates to Process for manufacturing a product from strip tape, such as a dermal or transdermal patch or another administration form for oral application, as well as fillable containers or sealed-margin bags, wherein<br>
-a web of material is separated into individual strips(6)<br>
-each strip (6) is introduced into a take-up channel (12) and continuously conveyed therein by negative pressure,<br>
-in the process, each strip (6) is turned on its way to the channel or through the channel by 90°,<br>
-the strip (6) are led one upon the other at the end of the take-up channels, and thereafter being  conveyed  in  a,   preferably  open,  groove  for processing under completion to form the finished product in a conversion equipment where the products are finished.<br>
Further details, features and advantages of this invention will become apparent from the following explanation of an embodiment example which is schematically illustrated in the figures.<br>
The figures show:<br>
Fig. 1:         a side view of the device<br>
Fig. 2:         a plan view of the device according to Fig. 1<br>
