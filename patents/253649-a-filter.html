				<td>Technical field<br>
The present invention relates to a filter comprising a filter<br>
housing and a filter lid, and at least one filter structure<br>
including cavities and resonators, said filter housing being<br>
made from zinc or a zinc alloy.<br>
Background to the invention, prior art<br>
Such a filter is previously known from WO 0197324 A1 (FOREM<br>
S.R.L.), which provides for a light and cheap filter housing<br>
which enables integration of other components. Also, it is<br>
easier to cast the housing in Zink or a Zink alloy compared to<br>
casting in Aluminium, which will increase the life time of the<br>
tools needed when casting the housing.<br>
Often, a DC voltage and a low frequency communication signal<br>
are superimposed on a RF signal fed into a filter for mobile<br>
communication. The DC voltage may be used to drive a low noise<br>
amplifier (LNA) in the filter and the low frequency<br>
communication signal contains information that is used<br>
internally in the filter, sent from the filter or passed<br>
through the filter, together or not with the DC voltage,<br>
without being distorted by the transfer function of the<br>
filter.<br>
To be able to realise this, the DC voltage together with the<br>
low frequency communication signal have to be removed from the<br>
input signal before the RF signal enters the filter structure,<br>
and, if desired, the DC voltage and/or the low frequency<br>
communication signal may be added to the output of the filter.<br><br>
Several solutions have been proposed during the years and<br>
figures 1 and 2 disclose solutions which will be described in<br>
more detail below. However, both these solutions have similar<br>
drawbacks, since they are difficult to produce in a reliable<br>
and stable way. There are risks for passive inter modulation<br>
(PIM) and it is difficult to control the tolerances of the<br>
structure which limits performance and are expensive to<br>
manufacture. Furthermore, RF tends to leak into the DC voltage<br>
and the low frequency communication signal due to the<br>
structure of a low pass filter.<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
The object of the invention is to provide a new way to produce<br>
a filter housing resulting in a more compact filter providing<br>
a DC extraction arrangement at the input of the filter.<br>
A solution to the purpose is achieved by a filter as defined<br>
in the characterising portion of claim 1, i.e. the filter<br>
housing is integrated with threaded input/output connectors<br>
and the walls defining the cavities, there being mounted at<br>
the input of the filter a DC extracting arrangement for<br>
extracting a DC voltage or low frequency signal superimposed<br>
on a radio frequency signal [RF signal), said RF signal being<br>
fed into a first resonator of the RF filter structure.<br>
An advantage with the inventive filter is that it is possible<br>
to reduce the required tolerances in the manufacturing process<br>
which in turn will minimise the size of the internal structure<br>
of the filter, and furthermore, the inventive filter makes it<br>
possible to integrate threaded connectors in the filter<br>
housing during casting.<br><br>
The invention will now be described in connection with the<br>
attached drawings, which are provided in a non-limited way, to<br>
enhance the understanding of the invention.<br><br>

Detailed description of preferred embodiments<br>
Figures 1 and 2 describe prior	art solutions for a DC<br>
extracting arrangement in a RF	filter, where the signal to be<br>
extracted (DC voltage or a low	frequency signal usually used<br>
for communication purposes) is	superimposed on a RF signal.<br><br>
Figure 1 shows a first type of prior art arrangement for<br>
extracting a DC voltage or low frequency signal in a RF filter<br>
10 having a housing 3a, 3b and a lid 5. A common signal,<br>
comprising a RF signal with a superimposed DC voltage and/or<br>
low frequency signal, is fed into an input connector 1. A<br>
connector rod 2 is connected to he input connector 1 and the<br>
connector rod 2 is isolated from the filter housing 3a, 3b. A<br>
first resonator 4 is capacitively coupled to the input<br>
connector 1 via said connector rod 2 and a first capacitor CRF.<br>
A first end of an inductor LDC is directly connected to the<br>
connector rod 2, usually by soldering, and a second end of the<br>
inductor LDC is connected to a second capacitor CDC, which is<br>
located outside of the RF filter 10. The inductor LDC is<br>
located inside a part of the filter housing 3a and extends<br>
through the filter lid 5, which is secured to the housing by<br>
screws or similar fastening means. The inductor LDC and the<br>
second capacitor CDC together forms a low pass filter (LE<br>
filter), and the DC voltage and/or the low frequency<br>
communication signal (DC/Com. Signal) is available on the<br>
outside of the filter. The second capacitor CDC may be<br>
implemented on a PCB (not shown) attached to the filter lid 5.<br>
There are drawbacks with the described DC extracting<br>
arrangement, especially concerning leakage of the RF signal<br>
into the. DC/Com signal. Furthermore, the connection of the<br>
first end of the inductor LDC is difficult to achieve due to<br>
the small space available for soldering it to the connector<br>
rod 2 .<br>
The second type of DC arrangement shown in figure 2 also<br>
comprises a filter 20, having a housing 3 and a lid 5, an<br>
input connector 1 connected to a connector rod 2. The lid 5 is<br>
secured to the housing 3 in a similar as described in<br><br>
connection with figure 1, and a first resonator 14 is located<br>
inside the filter 20.<br>
The connector rod 2, which isolated from the housing 3, is<br>
directly connected to an isolated part 11 of the first<br>
resonator 14, which means that the common signal, comprising<br>
the RF signal with the superimposed DC voltage and/or low<br>
frequency signal, is fed into the input connector 1 via the<br>
connector rod 2 to the isolated part 11 of the first resonator<br>
14. The first resonator further comprises a base part 12,<br>
which is electrically grounded to the lid 5 and isolated from<br>
the isolated part 11 by an isolating layer 13. A capacitor CRF<br>
is thus created.<br>
An end of a wire 15, acting as an inductor LDC, is connected to<br>
the isolated part 11 of the first resonator 14, and the wire<br>
15 is arranged through a hole 16 in the lid 5. The second end<br>
of the wire is connected to a second capacitor CDC, which is<br>
located outside of the RF filter 20. The second capacitor CDC<br>
may naturally be implemented on a PCB (not shown) if desired.<br>
The inductor LDC and the second capacitor CDc forms, as<br>
described in connection with figure 1, a low pass filter.<br>
The second type of prior art DC extracting arrangement also<br>
has drawbacks, especially regarding RF leakage in the DC/Co.<br>
signal, but also in the complex structure of the DC extracting<br>
arrangement where soldering of the wire to the first resonator<br>
14 is necessary to obtain a good contact.<br>
The basic idea of the invention, as described below, is to<br>
integrate the filter housing with threaded connectors.<br>
Figure 3 shows a first embodiment of a DC extracting<br>
arrangement according to the present invention arranged in a<br>
filter 30, having a housing 3 and a lid 5. An input connector<br><br>
1 and a connector rod 2, isolated from the housing 3, are<br>
provided to feed the common signal, comprising the RF signal<br>
with the superimposed DC/Com. signal, into the filter 30.<br>
A resonator 21, which could be the first resonator in a filter<br>
structure or a coupling rod for several filter structures, is<br>
provided with a cavity 22. The resonator 21 is electrically<br>
grounded to the filter lid 5 and the coupling rod 2 extends<br>
through an opening 23 in the resonator 21 into the cavity 22.<br>
A low pass filter (LP filter) comprising an inductor 24 and a<br>
capacitor 25 are provided inside the cavity 22 and the DC/Com.<br>
signal is fed out from the cavity 22, through an opening 27 in<br>
the filter lid 5.<br>
The LP filter is realised by connecting a first end of the<br>
inductor 24 with the end of the connector rod 2 extending into<br>
the cavity. 22. The second end of the inductor 24 is connected<br>
in series with the capacitor 25, which is grounded to the<br>
cavity wall, and the DC/Com. signal is extracted by connecting<br>
a wire 26 to the second end of the inductor 24 and leading it<br>
through the opening 27 in the filter lid 5.<br>
The described embodiment illustrates the basic idea of the<br>
invention and the figure 4a describes a preferred embodiment<br>
of the present invention.	<br>
In figure 4a similar features have the same reference numerals<br>
as previously used. The major difference between the<br>
previously described embodiment in figure 3 is that the LP<br>
filter is realised as a tubular LP filter 32. The connector<br>
rod 2 is conductively attached to the lower part 33 of the<br>
tubular LP filter 32 and an isolating layer 36, e.g. PTFE or<br>
Teflon, is provided between the tubular LP filter 32 and the<br>
cavity wall. An opening 37 in the isolating layer 36 is<br><br>
provided to facilitate the attachment of the conductor rod 2<br>
to the lower part 33 of the tubular LP filter 32.<br>
The tubular LP filter 32 further comprises, in this<br>
embodiment, two discs 34, where the discs and the lower part<br>
33	are interconnected with thin rods 35. Each disc will create<br>
a capacitance to the cavity wall and each thin rod will create<br>
a inductance, thus creating a LP filter. The DC/Co. signal is<br>
retrieved at the centre 38 of the upper end of the tubular LP<br>
filter.<br>
In this embodiment the filter is provided with a modified lid<br>
31 which has the resonator 21 integrated with the lid 31 and<br>
furthermore, a DC connector 39 is provided on the outside of<br>
the lid 31 to which the LP filter output 38 is connected.<br>
Figure 4b shows a third embodiment of the present invention.<br>
The embodiment in figure 4b essentially works similar to the<br>
embodiment shown in figure 4a, and as in figure 4a similar<br>
features have the same reference numerals as previously used.<br>
As in fig. 4a, the LP filter is realised as a tubular LP<br>
filter 32. In this -embodiment, however, the connector rod 2 is<br>
conductively attached to the lower part 33 of the tubular LP<br>
filter 32 of the resonator 21 from underneath in the figure<br>
instead of from the left side as in fig. 4a Further, the<br>
isolating layer 36 has been omitted and isolation is instead<br>
provided by an air gap between the cavity wall and the discs<br>
34	and the lower part 33. Also, the bottom portion of the<br>
cavity wall has been omitted. As in fig. 4b, the DC/Co. signal<br>
is retrieved at the upper end of the tubular LP filter,<br>
preferably from the centre of the uppermost disc 34. As in the<br>
previous embodiments, the. RF signal is coupled the outside of<br>
the resonator 21 and can be forwarded to a bandpass filter 41.<br><br>
Figure 5 shows an exploded perspective view of a fourth<br>
embodiment 50 of a filter having a DC extracting arrangement<br>
according to the present invention. The filter comprises five<br>
different parts: filter housing 51, a connector rod 52, a<br>
filter lid 53, resonators 54 and LP filter 55.<br>
A coupling rod 56, having a cavity 57, is integrated with the<br>
filter lid 53, as described in connection with figure 4a, but<br>
in this embodiment the edge of the coupling rod stretches<br>
through the lid 53 to form a rim 58 on the outside of the<br>
filter. An isolating layer (not shown) is mounted inside the<br>
cavity 57 to prevent short circuiting of the LP filter 55 when<br>
it's mounted inside the cavity. The filter housing 51 is<br>
provide with an opening 59 for inserting the conductor rod 52<br>
when attaching it to the LP filter 57 after the resonators 54<br>
and the lid 53 have been mounted to the housing 51.<br>
The filter lid may also be provided with a tuning means, such<br>
as a tuning screw, for tuning the frequency of the coupling<br>
rod. The tuning means is accessible from the outside of the<br>
filter when mounted.<br>
Figures 6a and 6b show cross-sectional views of the filter in<br>
figure 5. Figure 6a is a cross-sectional top view of the<br>
filter where the tuning means 60 is clearly shown.The<br>
connector rod 52 is attached to the LP filter in such a way to<br>
ensure a good electrical contact, e.g. threads. Figure 6b<br>
shows a partial cross-sectional view of the lid 53 including<br>
the mounted LP filter 55 and the connector rod 52. The<br>
isolating layer 61 may be seen in the cavity 57 between the LP<br>
filter 55 and the integrated coupling rod 56. The isolating<br>
layer could be any material that has a dielectric property.<br><br>
The DC extracting arrangement has only been described as a way<br>
to extract low frequency signals, e.g. DC signals or signals<br>
having a frequency up to a few MHz (2-4 MHz), but the same<br>
arrangement may naturally be used when adding DC and/or low<br>
frequency communication signals to a RF signal.<br>
Figure 7 shows a block diagram illustrating a duplex filter 70<br>
for a mobile telecommunication system. The input 71 of the<br>
duplex filter 70 could be connected to a base station (BTS)<br>
and the output 72 could be connected to an antenna 73.<br>
The duplex filter 70 comprises: a transmitting filter <br>
structure Tx; two receiving filter structures Rx with a low<br>
noise amplifier LNA in between; a DC/Com. signal extracting<br>
arrangement 74; and a DC/Com. signal adding arrangement 75.<br>
The LNA requires a DC voltage to operate and that is provided<br>
by circuits 76. The low frequency communication signal is<br>
normally not used within the duplex filter 70 but is forwarded<br>
from the input 71 to the output 72 using the DC extracting and<br>
adding arrangements.<br>
Figure 8 illustrates a block diagram when no low frequency<br>
communication signal is present and the DC voltage only is<br>
used to drive the LNA.	<br>
The filter shown in figure 5 (and other figures) is made from<br>
moulded Zink or Zink alloy which makes it possible to reduce<br>
the size of the filter housing since thinner walls may be<br>
manufactured using Zink or Zink alloy instead of using<br>
traditional material as Aluminium. Furthermore, the use of<br>
Zink or Zink alloy makes it possible to integrate treaded<br>
input and output connectors to the housing. The use of moulded<br>
Zink or Zink alloy has the distinct advantage that the<br>
moulding takes place at a lower pressure and temperature,<br><br>
compared to Aluminium, which in turn will increase the life<br>
time of the moulding tools used during the manufacturing<br>
process.<br>
Since it is possible to include complex structures in the<br>
moulded filter housing, the result is a much cheaper product<br>
compared to traditional filters made from Aluminium.<br>
Furthermore, it is also advantageous to mould the filter lid,<br>
including the DC extracting arrangement as described in<br>
connection with figures 5, 6a and 6b, in Zink or a Zink alloy.<br>
The temperature coefficient of both the housing and the lid<br>
will then be approximately equal which will increase the<br>
performance of the filter during operation. However, the lid<br>
is preferably coated with a highly conductive material, such<br>
as silver, to increase the performance of the filter.<br>
Zink alloys that could be used are:<br>
ZP0410 according to standard EN-1774. This alloy is a good,<br>
"standard alloy".<br>
ZP0810 according to standard EN-1774, is also called ZAMAK 8<br>
(ZnA18Cul).. Stronger than ZP0410 but is more fragile and has a<br>
less expansion coefficient.<br>
Other possible Zink alloys are:<br>
ZP0400 according to standard EN-1774.<br>
ZP0610 according to standard EN-1774.<br><br>

ABSTRACT<br><br>
A FILTER<br>
The present invention relates to a filter (50) comprising a<br>
filter housing (51) and a filter lid (53), and at least one RF<br>
bandpass filter structure having cavities, being defined by<br>
walls, a first resonator (56) and further resonators (54) ,<br>
characterised in that the filter housing is of casted Zink or<br>
a Zink alloy, and has integrated casted threaded input/output<br>
connectors, from which input connector a radio frequency<br>
signal (RF signal), with a superimposed DC voltage and/or low<br>
frequency communication signal, is fed by a connector rod (52)<br>
to said first resonator (56) of the RF bandpass filter<br>
structure, a DC extracting arrangement is included in the<br>
filter (50), said DC extracting arrangement including a<br>
tubular low pass filter (LP filter) (55) being arranged within<br>
a cavity of said first resonator (56), wherein said DC<br>
extracting arrangement is conductively attached to said input<br>
connector through said LP filter (55) and said connector rod<br>
(52), and is arranged for extracting said DC voltage and/or<br>
low frequency communication signal, up to two to four MHz,<br>
being superimposed on said RF signal, wherein said DC<br>
extracting arrangement is arranged for feeding said DC voltage<br>
and/or low frequency communication signal via said tubular LP<br>
filter (55) to the outside of said RF bandpass filter<br>
structure, and for using said DC voltage to drive a low noise<br>
amplifier (LNA) in the filter (50), and said cavity of said<br>
first resonator (56) has a bottom portion of its cavity wall<br>
being omitted such that said RF signal is coupled to the<br>
outside of the first resonator (56) to said further resonators<br>
(54) of said RF bandpass filter structure.</td>
