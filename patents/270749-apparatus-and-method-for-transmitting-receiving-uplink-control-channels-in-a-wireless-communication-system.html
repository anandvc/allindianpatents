				<td>APPARATUS AND METHOD FOR TRANSMITTING/RECEIVING UPLINK<br>
CONTROL CHANNELS IN A WIRELESS COMMUNICATION SYSTEM<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1. Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates generally to an apparatus and method for<br>
transmitting/receiving control channels in a wireless communication system, and<br>
more particularly, to an apparatus and method for transmitting/receiving control<br>
channels on the uplink in a mobile communication system<br>
2. Description of the Related Art<br>
Generally, mobile communication systems have been developed to support<br>
communication while guaranteeing mobility for users. Due to the rapid progress of<br>
the communication technologies, such mobile communication systems are<br>
developing into advanced communication systems capable of supporting not only the<br>
voice communication, but also the high-speed data communication. Now, the mobile<br>
communication system has evolved to support higher-speed data communication,<br>
an example of which is an Enhanced Universal Terrestrial Radio Access (EUTRA)<br>
system, which is the next generation mobile communication standard proposed by 3rd<br>
Generation Partnership Project (3GPP).<br>
Mobile communication systems can be classified into various types, such as<br>
Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA), Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA)<br>
and Frequency Division Multiple Access (FDMA). Among them, CDMA has been<br>
generally used. However, since CDMA has difficulty in supporting a large volume of<br>
data at high speed due to the limited number of orthogonal codes, Orthogonal<br>
Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA) and Single Carrier - Frequency<br>
Division Multiple Access (SC-FDMA), which are a kind of FDMA, are now applied<br>
as downlink and uplink standard technologies of EUTRA, respectively.<br>
In the EUTRA system, uplink control information includes<br>
Acknowledgement (ACK)/Negative ACK (NACK) feedback information, which is a<br>
signal used for feeding back success/failure in reception of downlink transmission<br>
data. The uplink control information also includes Channel Quality Indication (CQI)<br>
information used for feeding back downlink channel quality. The ACK/NACK<br>
information, which is generally composed of 1 bit, is repeatedly transmitted several<br>
times for improvement of its reception performance and expansion of the cell<br>
coverage. ACK/NACK is defined herein as ACK or NACK.<br>
Generally, the CQI information is composed of multiple bits to express the<br>
channel quality, and is transmitted after undergoing channel coding for reception<br>
performance improvement and cell coverage expansion. Block coding or<br>
convolutional coding is available as the channel coding for the CQI information. A<br>
reception reliability required in receiving the control information is determined<br>
according to the type of the control information. Generally, ACK/NACK, which<br>
requires a Bit Error Rate (BER) of about 10-2-10-4, is lower in required BER than<br>
CQI, which requires a BER of 10-2~10-1.<br>
In the EUTRA system, when a User Equipment (UE), or a mobile station,<br>
transmits only the uplink control information channel without data, it uses an<br>
allocated particular frequency band for control information transmission. A physical<br>
channel for transmitting only the control information is defined as Physical Uplink<br>
Control Channel (PUCCH), and the PUCCH is mapped to the allocated particular<br>
frequency band.<br>
FIG. 1 is a diagram illustrating a transmission structure for a physical<br>
channel PUCCH for transmitting control information on the uplink in a 3GPP<br>
EUTRA system.<br>
In FIG 1, the vertical axis represents a frequency domain and the horizontal<br>
axis represents a time domain. A scope of the time domain is shown as one subframe<br>
102, while a scope of the frequency domain is shown as a system transmission<br>
bandwidth 110. The subframe 102, which is a basic transmission unit of the uplink,<br>
has a 1-ms length, and one subframe is composed of two 0.5-ms slots 104 and 106.<br>
Slots 104 and 106 are each composed of multiple SC-FDMA symbols 111-124, and<br>
131~144, respectively. FIG. 1 illustrates an example where one slot is composed of 7<br>
SC-FDMA symbols.<br>
The minimum unit of the frequency domain is a subcarrier, and the basic unit<br>
of resource allocation is a Resource Block (RB), 108 and 109. The RBs 108 and 109<br>
are composed of multiple subcarriers and multiple SC-FDMA symbols. In the<br>
example shown in FIG. 1, 12 subcarriers and 14 SC-FDMA symbols constituting 2<br>
slots form one RB. Even in the downlink to which OFDM transmission is applied,<br>
one RB is generated from 12 subcarriers and 14 OFDM symbols.<br>
Frequency bands, to which the PUCCHs are mapped, correspond to RBs 108<br>
and 109 situated on both ends of the system transmission bandwidth 110. The<br>
PUCCH can undergo frequency hopping to increase its frequency diversity during<br>
one subframe, and in this case, slot-by-slot hopping is possible. An Evolved Node B<br>
(ENB), or base station, can occasionally allocate multiple RBs for PUCCH<br>
transmission to approve transmission of control information from multiple users. In<br>
FIG. 1, the frequency hopping is shown by reference numeral 150 and reference<br>
numeral 160. A detailed description of the frequency hopping is provided below.<br>
Control information # 1, which was transmitted through the pre-allocated RB<br>
108 in the first slot 104, is transmitted through another pre-allocated RB 109 after<br>
undergoing frequency hopping in the second slot 106. On the contrary, control<br>
information #2, which was transmitted through the pre-allocated RB 109 in the first<br>
slot 104, is transmitted through another pre-allocated RB 108 after undergoing<br>
frequency hopping in the second slot 106.<br>
In the example of FIG. 1, in one subframe 102, the control information #1 is<br>
transmitted on SC-FDMA symbols 111, 113, 114, 115, 117, 138, 140, 141, 142 and<br>
144, and the control information #2 is transmitted on SC-FDMA symbols 131, 133,<br>
134, 135, 137, 118, 120, 121, 122 and 124. Reference Signals (RSs), also known as<br>
pilots, are transmitted in Pilot SC-FDMA symbols 112, 116, 139 and 143 (or 132,<br>
136, 119 and 123). The RS is generated with a predetermined sequence, and used for<br>
channel estimation for coherent demodulation at a receiver. In FIG. 1, the number of<br>
SC-FDMA symbols for control information transmission, the number of SC-FDMA<br>
symbols for RS transmission, and their positions in the subframe are shown by way<br>
of example, and these are subject to change according to the types of desired<br>
transmission control information and/or the system operation.<br>
Code Division Multiplexing (CDM) can be used to multiplex uplink control<br>
information for different users, such as ACK/NACK information, CQI information,<br>
and Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) feedback information transmitted over<br>
PUCCH. CDM is robust against interference signals compared with Frequency<br>
Division Multiplexing (FDM).<br>
A Zadoff-Chu (ZC) sequence is under discussion as a sequence to be used<br>
for CDM-multiplexing the control information. Since the ZC sequence has a constant<br>
signal amplitude in the time and frequency domains, it has a good Peak-to-Average<br>
Power Ratio (PAPR) characteristic and shows excellent channel estimation<br>
performance in the frequency domain. Further, the ZC sequence has a characteristic<br>
that a circular autocorrelation for a non-zero shift is zero (0). Therefore, UEs<br>
transmitting control information using the same ZC sequence can be identified using<br>
different cyclic shift values of the ZC sequence.<br>
In the actual wireless channel environment, different cyclic shift values are<br>
set for the users intending to undergo multiplexing so as to satisfy a condition that<br>
they are greater than the maximum transmission delay of the wireless transmission<br>
path, thereby maintaining inter-user orthogonality. Therefore, the number of users<br>
capable of multiple access is determined from the length and cyclic shift values of<br>
the ZC sequence. The ZC sequence can be applied even to the SC-FDMA symbols<br>
for RS transmission, to identify RSs of different UEs using the cyclic shift values.<br>
Generally, a length of the ZC sequence used for the PUCCH is assumed to<br>
be 12 samples, which is equal to the number of subcarriers constituting one RB. In<br>
this case, since the maximum possible number of different cyclic shift values of the<br>
ZC sequence is 12, it is possible to multiplex a maximum of 12 PUCCHs to one RB<br>
by allocating different cyclic shift values to the PUCCHs. The Typical Urban (TU)<br>
model, which is the wireless channel model generally considered in the EUTRA<br>
system, applies cyclic shift values to PUCCHs at intervals of at least 2 samples due<br>
to the frequency-selective channel characteristic. Applying the cyclic shift values at<br>
intervals of at least 2 samples in this way restricts the number of cyclic shift values<br>
within one RB to 6 or less. In this manner, the orthogonality between PUCCHs that<br>
are mapped to cyclic shifts on a one-to-one basis can be maintained without its<br>
abrupt loss.<br>
FIG. 2 illustrates an example of multiplexing CQIs for users with different<br>
cyclic shift values of the ZC sequence within the same RB when transmitting CQIs<br>
over the PUCCHs having the structure of FIG. 1.<br>
In FIG 2, the vertical axis represents cyclic shift values 200 of a ZC<br>
sequence. In the TU model assumed as the wireless channel, since the maximum<br>
number of channels that can undergo multiplexing without an abrupt orthogonality<br>
loss within one RB is 6, there is shown an occasion where 6 CQIs 202, 204, 206, 208,<br>
210 and 212 undergo multiplexing. In the example of FIG 2, the same RB and the<br>
same ZC sequence are used for transmission of the CQI information in such a<br>
manner that CQI 202 from UE #1 is transmitted using a cyclic shift '0' 214; CQI 204<br>
from UE #2 is transmitted using a cyclic shift '2' 218; CQI 206 from UE #3 is<br>
transmitted using a cyclic shift '4' 222; CQI 208 from UE #4 is transmitted using a<br>
cyclic shift '6' 226; CQI 210 from UE #5 is transmitted using a cyclic shift '8' 230;<br>
and CQI 212 from UE #6 is transmitted using a cyclic shift '10' 234. With reference<br>
to FIG 1, a description will be made as to how the control information signal is<br>
mapped to the ZC sequence during CDM transmission of the control information<br>
based on the ZC sequence. A length-N ZC sequence for UE #i is defined as g(n+?i)<br>
mod N, where n=0, ..., N-1, ?i denotes a cyclic shift value for UE #i, and i denotes a<br>
UE index used for identifying a UE. Also, a control information signal that a UE #i<br>
intends to transmit is defined as mik, where k=1, ..., Nsym. If Nsym denotes the<br>
number of SC-FDMA symbols for control information transmission within one<br>
subframe, a signal Ci,k,n (nth sample of a kth SC-FDMA symbol of UE #i) mapped to<br>
each SC-FDMA symbol is defined as Equation (1).<br><br>
In the example of FIG 1, in one subframe, the number Nsym of SC-FDMA<br>
symbols for control information transmission is 10, excluding the 4 SC-FDMA<br>
symbols for RS transmission, and a length N of the ZC sequence is 12, which is<br>
equal to the number of subcarriers constituting one RB. From the standpoint of one<br>
UE, a cyclic-shifted ZC sequence is applied to each SC-FDMA symbol, and its<br>
desired transmission control information signal is generated in such a manner that<br>
one modulation symbol is multiplied by the ZC sequence cyclic-shifted in the time<br>
domain at every SC-FDMA symbol for control information transmission. Therefore,<br>
a maximum of Nsym control information modulation symbols can be transmitted per<br>
subframe. That is, in the example of FIG 1, a maximum of 10 control information<br>
modulation symbols can be transmitted during one subframe.<br>
It is possible to increase the multiplexing capacity of PUCCHs for<br>
transmitting the control information by additionally applying time-domain<br>
orthogonal covers, aside from the CDM control information transmission based on<br>
the ZC sequence. A Walsh sequence can be an example of the orthogonal cover.<br>
There are M orthogonal sequences as length-M orthogonal covers. Specifically, for<br>
the 1-bit control information like ACK/NACK, its multiplexing capacity can be<br>
increased by applying time-domain orthogonal covers to the SC-FDMA symbols to<br>
which ACK/NACK is mapped during transmission. The EUTRA system considers<br>
that the PUCCH for ACK/NACK transmission uses 3 SC-FDMA symbols for RS<br>
transmission per slot for improvement of channel estimation performance. Therefore,<br>
in the example of FIG. 1 where one slot is composed of 7 SC-FDMA symbols, 4 SC-<br>
FDMA symbols for ACK/NACK transmission are available. The orthogonality loss<br>
caused by a change in wireless channels can be minimized by restricting the time<br>
interval, where the time-domain orthogonal covers are applied, to one slot or less.<br>
Length-4 orthogonal covers are applied to the 4 SC-FDMA symbols for ACK/NACK<br>
transmission, and length-3 orthogonal covers are applied to the 3 SC-FDMA symbols<br>
for RS transmission.<br>
Regarding the ACK/NACK and RS, their users can be identified with cyclic<br>
shift values of the ZC sequence, and the additional user identification is possible by<br>
the orthogonal covers. For coherent reception of ACK/NACK, since there should<br>
exist RSs that are mapped to ACK/NACK on a one-to-one basis, the multiplexing<br>
capacity of ACK/NACK signals is restricted by the RSs mapped to ACK/NACK. For<br>
example, in the TU channel model where 6 cyclic shift values are considered per RB,<br>
since different length-3 time-domain orthogonal covers can be applied to cyclic<br>
shifts of the ZC sequence, which are applied to RSs, RSs from a maximum of 18<br>
different users can undergo multiplexing. Regarding ACK/NACK, since it is mapped<br>
to RSs on a one-to-one basis, a maximum of 18 ACK/NACK signals can be<br>
multiplexed per RB. In this case, there are 4 length-4 orthogonal covers applied to<br>
ACK/NACK, and among them, 3 orthogonal covers are used. The orthogonal covers<br>
applied to ACK/NACK can be recognized in common between a UE and an ENB<br>
under agreement previously made therebetween, or by signaling. As a result, it is<br>
possible to increase the multiplexing capacity three times compared with the case<br>
where the time-domain orthogonal covers are unused.<br>
FIG. 3 illustrates an example of multiplexing ACK/NACK for each user with<br>
different cyclic shift values of the ZC sequence and additional time-domain<br>
orthogonal covers in the same RB in the PUCCH structure for ACK/NACK<br>
transmission.<br>
In FIG. 3, the vertical axis represents cyclic shift values 300 of a ZC<br>
sequence, and the horizontal axis represents time-domain orthogonal covers 302. In<br>
the TU model assumed as the wireless channel, if the maximum number of cyclic<br>
shifts that can undergo multiplexing without an abrupt orthogonality loss within one<br>
RB is 6, and 3 length-4 orthogonal covers 364, 366 and 368 are additionally used, a<br>
maximum of 18 (=6*3) ACK/NACK signals 304, 306, 308, 310, 312, 314, 316, 318,<br>
320, 322, 324, 326, 328, 330, 332, 334, 336 and 338 can undergo multiplexing. In<br>
the example of FIG. 3, the same RB and the same ZC sequence are used for<br>
ACK/NACK transmission in such a manner that ACK/NACK 304 from UE #1 is<br>
transmitted using a cyclic shift '0' 340 and an orthogonal cover '0' 364; ACK/NACK<br>
306 from UE #2 is transmitted using a cyclic shift '0' 340 and an orthogonal cover '1'<br>
366; ACK/NACK 308 from UE #3 is transmitted using a cyclic shift '0' 340 and an<br>
orthogonal cover '2' 368; ...; ACK/NACK 334 from UE #16 is transmitted using a<br>
cyclic shift '10' 360 and an orthogonal cover '0' 364; ACK/NACK 336 from UE #17<br>
is transmitted using a cyclic shift '10' 360 and an orthogonal cover '1' 366; and<br>
ACK/NACK 338 from UE #18 is transmitted using a cyclic shift '10' 360 and an<br>
orthogonal cover '2' 368. The orthogonal covers 364, 366 and 368 are length-4<br>
orthogonal codes satisfying orthogonality therebetween.<br>
In transmitting the CQI or ACK/NACK through the PUCCH in this way,<br>
there is a possible case where one UE should simultaneously transmit CQI and<br>
ACK/NACK within one subframe. In its most typical case, several subframes before<br>
it transmits CQI, a UE receives its scheduled downlink data channel from an ENB<br>
over a downlink control channel. Upon receipt of the downlink control channel, the<br>
UE receives the data from the RB where the downlink data is transmitted, decodes<br>
the received data, and transmits ACK/NACK corresponding to the decoding result. If<br>
the subframe where the UE should transmit the ACK/NACK is coincident in timing<br>
with the subframe where it should transmit CQI, the UE must transmit the<br>
ACK/NACK and CQI together within the subframe. The UE should transmit RS<br>
even when transmitting the ACK/NACK and CQI. However, since such matters have<br>
not been discussed yet in the standard, there is a need for a transmission/reception<br>
apparatus and method for simultaneous transmission of ACK/NACK and CQI, and<br>
simultaneous transmission of RS.<br>
In this case, even when a UE has failed in reception of the scheduling control<br>
channel transmitted over the downlink, the UE can transmit only the CQI channel.<br>
Then, though the ENB waits for reception of ACK/NACK information for the<br>
scheduling control channel, the UE transmits CQI information in reality. In this case,<br>
even though the UE has transmitted only the CQI information, the ENB may<br>
misrecognize that it has received ACK/NACK information and CQI information<br>
from the UE. Further, the ENB may detect the nonexistent ACK/NACK information<br>
from the CQI channel, generating an error. Therefore, the ENB may misrecognize<br>
the control information transmitted from the UE, probably causing a communication<br>
failure.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Preferred embodiments of the present invention are described in detail with<br>
reference to the accompanying drawings. Similar components are designated by<br>
similar reference numerals although they are illustrated in different drawings.<br>
Detailed descriptions of constructions or processes known in the art may be omitted<br>
to avoid obscuring the present invention. Terms used herein are defined based on<br>
functions in the present invention and may vary according to users, operators'<br>
intention or usual practices. Therefore, the definition of the terms should be made<br>
based on contents throughout the specification.<br>
In the following description, the present invention provides an apparatus and<br>
method for transmitting/receiving RS symbols transmitted together with control<br>
information when one UE should simultaneously transmit the control information<br>
such as ACK/NACK and CQI information.<br>
When a UE receives its scheduled downlink data channel from an ENB over<br>
a downlink control channel several subframes before the UE transmits CQI, the ENB,<br>
expecting that the UE will transmit both the CQI and ACK/NACK information in the<br>
corresponding subframe, performs a reception operation according thereto. However,<br>
upon failure in reception of the downlink control channel, the UE transmits only the<br>
CQI information in the subframe. In this case, since the ENB misrecognizes that<br>
ACK/NACK and CQI information together underwent channel coding or Time<br>
Division Multiplexing (TDM) in the uplink control channel received from the UE,<br>
even though no ACK/NACK information is included in the control channel, the ENB<br>
may detect ACK/NACK information, generating an error. Then the ENB may<br>
undesirably discard the data packet and schedule the next new data packet to the UE,<br>
misrecognizing that the UE has successfully received the scheduled data packet by<br>
the downlink scheduling channel.<br>
The present invention provides an RS symbol transmission/reception method<br>
and apparatus for preventing a false alarm that when an ENB expects to receive both<br>
CQI and ACK/NACK from a UE in a certain frame, if the UE transmits only the CQI<br>
channel, the ENB detects the nonexistent ACK/NACK information from the CQI<br>
channel. The present invention applies different RS symbol patterns for a case where<br>
the UE transmits only the CQI channel, and another case where the UE transmits<br>
both CQI and ACK/NACK information. Therefore, even though the UE transmitted<br>
only the CQI information, if the ENB estimates a channel from an RS symbol,<br>
misrecognizing that CQI and ACK/NACK information were transmitted together, it<br>
acquires a channel estimate different from the actual channel, preventing the channel<br>
compensation from being abnormally achieved. As a result, the present invention<br>
prevents occurrence of an error that the ENB receiver falsely detects the<br>
ACK/NACK information from the CQI channel transmitted by the UE.<br>
Although embodiments of the present invention will be described in detail<br>
herein with reference to an OFDM-based cellular wireless communication system, it<br>
will be obvious to those skilled in the art that the main idea of the present invention<br>
can be applied to other communication systems having similar technical background<br>
and channel format with a slight modification without departing from the scope of<br>
the present invention.<br>
A detailed description will now be made of the uplink RS symbol<br>
transmission/reception method and apparatus according to three different<br>
embodiments of the present invention.<br>
FIG 4 illustrates a subframe structure of an uplink control channel for a case<br>
only the CQI is transmitted, or CQI and ACK/NACK are transmitted together<br>
according to an embodiment of the present invention. Although not illustrated in<br>
detail in FIG 4, in the RB where PUCCH #k is transmitted, PUCCH for transmitting<br>
CQI or ACK/NACK of a different UE can be transmitted using a different cyclic<br>
shift of the ZC sequence from that of the PUCCH #k. In FIG 4, only PUCCH #k is<br>
shown by way of example. In FIG 4, b1, b2,..., b10 represent modulation symbols of<br>
control information transmitted over the control channel, and RS1, RS2, RS3 and<br>
RS4 represent RS symbols used for demodulating the control information<br>
modulation symbols at a receiver. As described above, in the EUTRA uplink, the<br>
symbols each are transmitted after being multiplied by a length-12 ZC sequence.<br>
The channel structure shown in FIG 4 has a characteristic that it has<br>
different RS symbol patterns for a case where only CQI is transmitted through the<br>
control channel symbols b1, b2, ..., b10, and another case where CQI and<br>
ACK/NACK information are transmitted together through the symbols. Particularly,<br>
in the example of FIG. 4, particular RS symbols (RS2 and RS4 in FIG. 4) have an<br>
orthogonal relation with each other in order to distinguish the case where only CQI is<br>
transmitted from the case where CQI and ACK/NACK information are transmitted<br>
together. That is, in case 400 where only CQI is transmitted, two RS symbols of each<br>
slot have patterns 401 and 402 of [+1 +1]. However, in case 403 where CQI and<br>
ACK/NACK are transmitted together, two RS symbols of each slot have patterns 404<br>
and 405 of [+1-1].<br>
As the UE transmits RS symbols of different patterns to the ENB according<br>
to the possible cases in this way, the ENB can remarkably reduce the false alarm<br>
probability for the ACK/NACK information. For instance, since the UE has failed<br>
in reception of the downlink scheduling control channel transmitted by the ENB,<br>
when the UE transmits only the CQI information in the corresponding subframe by<br>
applying the RS symbol patterns 401 and 402, the ENB receiver performs channel<br>
estimation on the assumption that the UE transmitted both CQI and ACK/NACK<br>
information for the downlink control channel by applying the RS symbol patterns<br>
404 and 405. Thus, the ENB obtains totally irrelevant channel estimates, so that it<br>
cannot normally demodulate and decode the symbols transmitted by the UE. Since<br>
the RS symbol patterns 401 and 404 have an orthogonal relation with each other, a<br>
Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) of the channel estimates obtained when the ENB<br>
receiver applies wrong RS symbol patterns, is very low so that normal demodulation<br>
is impossible. That is, the present invention applies different RS symbol patterns<br>
having orthogonality for the case where only CQI is transmitted and the case where<br>
CQI and ACK/NACK are transmitted together. This noticeably reduces the possible<br>
error that the ENB falsely detects ACK/NACK and CQI information as it makes<br>
wrong channel estimation from RS symbols, when it has wrong information on the<br>
control channel format applied by the UE.<br>
In this embodiment of the present invention, the RS symbol patterns 401 and<br>
402 applied for the case 400, and the RS symbol patterns 404 and 405 applied for the<br>
case 403 are given herein by way of example, and other patterns can also be applied.<br>
FIG 5 illustrates a transmission procedure of a UE according to an<br>
embodiment of the present invention.<br>
In step 500, the UE generates CQI information it will transmit in a<br>
corresponding subframe, at a transmission period for CQI information. Thereafter, in<br>
step 501, the UE determines if there is a need to transmit ACK/NACK information<br>
and CQI information together in the subframe. For instance, if the UE received a<br>
downlink data packet in the previous subframe, it can transmit ACK/NACK<br>
information for the decoding result in the corresponding subframe. However, if the<br>
UE has not perceived receipt of the downlink data packet, since it failed to receive a<br>
downlink control channel for the downlink data packet,or if the ENB has scheduled<br>
no downlink data packet to the UE, the UE does not need the ACK/NACK<br>
transmission. When there is no need for ACK/NACK transmission in the subframe,<br>
the UE channel-codes the CQI information, and then maps it to the corresponding<br>
symbols (i.e., symbols b1, b2, ..., b10 in FIG 4) in the subframe in step 502.<br>
Thereafter, in step 503, the UE applies, to the RS symbols, the RS symbol patterns<br>
(401 and 402 in FIG. 4) corresponding to the case where only CQI is transmitted.<br>
However, when there is a need to transmit ACK/NACK information and CQI<br>
together in the subframe, the UE channel-codes the ACK/NACK information and<br>
CQI together, or maps them to the corresponding symbols b1, b2, ..., b10 in the<br>
subframe by TDM, in step 504, and applies the RS symbol patterns (404 and 405 in<br>
FIG. 4) corresponding to the above case to the RS symbols in step 505. Finally, in<br>
step 506, the UE transmits SC-FDMA symbols by multiplying their associated ZC<br>
sequences thereto.<br>
FIG 6 is a block diagram illustrating a structure of a UE transmission<br>
apparatus according to an embodiment of the present invention.<br>
A CQI generator 601 and an ACK/NACK generator 603 generate CQI and<br>
ACK/NACK to be transmitted, respectively. The CQI generated by the CQI<br>
generator 601 is input to a channel encoder 605 or a multiplexer and encoder 607.<br>
The channel encoder 605 channel-codes a CQI value when only the CQI is<br>
transmitted. However, when CQI and ACK/NACK are simultaneously transmitted,<br>
the CQI generated by the CQI generator 601 and the ACK/NACK generated by the<br>
ACK/NACK generator 603 are multiplexed and channel-coded in the multiplexer<br>
and encoder 607. A first switch 609, under the control of a controller 611, switches<br>
an output of the channel encoder 605 or the multiplexer and encoder 607 to a second<br>
switch 615.<br>
As one of its important functions, the controller 611 transmits pattern control<br>
information to an RS symbol generator 613 so that RSs are generated, according to<br>
whether the UE transmits only the CQI or transmits CQI and ACK/NACK together.<br>
The second switch 615, under the control of the controller 611, inputs to a ZC<br>
sequence multiplier 617 the control information symbol output from the first switch<br>
609 or the RS symbol output from the RS symbol generator 613 according to the<br>
position of the corresponding SC-FDMA symbol in the slot. The symbol multiplied<br>
by the ZC sequence in the ZC sequence multiplier 617, after passing through a Fast<br>
Fourier Transform (FFT) transformer 619, is input to a subcarrier mapper 621 where<br>
it inputs the control information to an IFFT transformer 623 corresponding to a<br>
transmission band. Then the IFFT transformer 623 performs IFFT transform and<br>
outputs the result to a Radio Frequency (RF) unit (not shown in FIG. 6) where it up-<br>
converts the control information to a radio band before transmission.<br>
When the ZC sequence is a sequence defined in the frequency domain, the<br>
symbol multiplied by the ZC sequence is directly input to the subcarrier mapper 621<br>
without the need for the FFT transformer 619.<br>
FIG 7 is a diagram illustrating an ENB's reception procedure for CQI and<br>
ACK/NACK channels according to an embodiment of the present invention.<br>
In step 700, the ENB recognizes a subframe where it is scheduled to receive<br>
CQI from a target UE. Then, in step 701, the ENB acquires a correlation value by<br>
performing correlation on each SC-FDMA symbol in the subframe with the<br>
corresponding ZC sequence. The correlation value, after undergoing channel<br>
compensation, becomes an estimate of a control channel modulation symbol<br>
transmitted by the corresponding SC-FDMA symbol. In step 702, the ENB<br>
determines if the UE is scheduled to transmit ACK/NACK along with the CQI in the<br>
subframe. If the UE is scheduled to transmit only the CQI in the subframe, the ENB<br>
acquires in step 703 a channel estimate by applying an RS symbol pattern<br>
corresponding to the case where it transmits only the CQI. In step 704, the ENB<br>
performs channel compensation by applying the channel estimate to the SC-FDMA<br>
symbols carrying CQI symbols. Thereafter, in step 705, the ENB performs<br>
demodulation and channel decoding on the received control channel symbols. If the<br>
ENB transmitted a downlink control channel to the UE several subframes ago, the<br>
ENB will determine that the UE will transmit CQI together with ACK/NACK<br>
information for the scheduled data packet over the control channel. If it is<br>
determined in step 702 that the UE transmitted CQI and ACK/NACK information<br>
together, the ENB acquires a channel estimate by applying an RS symbol pattern<br>
corresponding to the case in step 706, and performs channel compensation on the<br>
received control channel symbols by applying the channel estimate in step 707.<br>
Thereafter, in step 708, the ENB performs demodulation and decoding with a format<br>
corresponding to the case where CQI and ACK/NACK are transmitted together,<br>
thereby acquiring ACK/NACK information and CQI information.<br>
If the ENB failed in the decoding, or if a correlation value with the RS<br>
symbol pattern corresponding to the case where only the CQI is transmitted is greater<br>
than the received RS symbol signal, or if a soft-decision metric of a codeword<br>
decoded after channel compensation is very low, the ENB may consider that the UE<br>
transmitted only the CQI. When the UE transmitted only the CQI and applied an RS<br>
symbol pattern according thereto, for the signal decoded through steps 706, 707 and<br>
708, the received RS symbol correlation value and the decoded CQI and<br>
ACK/NACK symbols are very low in energy due to the use of the false RS symbol<br>
pattern. Therefore, the ENB can reattempt to demodulate the CQI by additionally<br>
performing steps 703, 704 and 705.<br>
Meanwhile, another reception method can compare an SNR of a channel<br>
estimate obtained from the RS symbol pattern considered for the case 400 in FIG. 4<br>
with an SNR of a channel estimate obtained from the RS symbol pattern considered<br>
for the case 403 to check which case is higher in the SNR of the channel estimate,<br>
thereby determining whether the UE applied the transmission (format) for the case<br>
400 or the transmission for the case 403. If the ENB misrecognizes that the UE<br>
transmitted only the CQI information by applying the format for the case 400 even<br>
though the UE transmitted CQI and ACK/NACK together by applying the format for<br>
the case 403, the ENB can perceive the fact that the UE has failed to normally<br>
receive the scheduling channel for the downlink data packet.<br>
FIG 8 is a block diagram illustrating a structure of an ENB reception<br>
apparatus according to an embodiment of the present invention.<br>
A signal received through an RF unit (not shown in FIG. 8) is converted into<br>
a frequency-domain signal by means of an FFT transformer 801. The converted<br>
frequency-domain signal is applied to a subcarrier demapper 803 by which a<br>
subcarrier signal corresponding to a PUCCH signal of the corresponding UE is<br>
selected therefrom. Thereafter, the selected subcarrier signal is applied to a ZC<br>
sequence correlator 805 where it undergoes correlation with the applied ZC sequence<br>
in the corresponding symbol interval, and then input to an IFFT transformer 807. The<br>
signal output from the IFFT transformer 807 is input to an RS symbol decover 813<br>
by way of a first demultiplexer 809 when the current SC-FDMA symbol index<br>
corresponds to an RS symbol, and a value carried on the RS symbol is decovered in<br>
the RS symbol decover 813. Thereafter, a channel compensator 811 can obtain a<br>
channel estimate using the output of the RS symbol decover 813. Under the control<br>
of the controller 816, the decovering is performed with the RS symbol value<br>
corresponding to the case where only the CQI information is received, or the RS<br>
symbol value corresponding to the case where CQI and ACK/NACK are received<br>
together.<br>
Based on the value output from the controller 816, the channel compensator<br>
811 performs channel estimation and channel compensation. That is, the control<br>
channel symbols are input to a second demultiplexer 815 via the first demultiplexer<br>
809 after undergoing channel compensation in the channel compensator 811. Then<br>
the second demultiplexer 815, under the control of the controller 816, provides its<br>
output to a channel decoder 817 when only the CQI information is received, and the<br>
input signal is decoded in the channel decoder 817. Based on the signal output from<br>
the channel decoder 817, a CQI determiner 821 makes a decision on CQI<br>
information. When a received SNR of the received CQI signal or RS signal is low,<br>
the decoded CQI information can be discarded in the CQI determiner 821.<br>
When CQI and ACK/NACK symbol are received together, the CQI and<br>
ACK/NACK information undergo channel decoding and demultiplexing in a channel<br>
decoder and demultiplexer 819, and the results are input to the CQI determiner 821<br>
and an ACK/NACK determiner 823, which make decisions on CQI information and<br>
ACK/NACK information, respectively. As described above, when received SNRs of<br>
the received CQI, ACK/NACK and RS signal are low, the decoded information can<br>
be discarded. In particular, application of the RS structure proposed by the present<br>
invention can remarkably reduce the SNR of the received RS signal when the ENB<br>
performs ACK/NACK reception due to the occurrence of an error that it<br>
misrecognizes that ACK/NACK and CQI information were transmitted together even<br>
though the UE transmitted only the CQI information. This contributes to a noticeable<br>
decrease in the probability that the ENB will misunderstand that ACK/NACK was<br>
transmitted.<br>
FIGs. 9A and 9B illustrate a subframe structure of an uplink control channel<br>
for CQI-only transmission or simultaneous transmission of CQI and ACK/NACK<br>
according to another embodiment of the present invention.<br>
A difference between this embodiment and the embodiment shown in FIG 4<br>
is that as a long-length Cyclic Prefix (CP) is applied to an SC-FDMA symbol, 6<br>
symbols exist in each slot, and one of the symbols is an RS symbol. The RS symbol<br>
is transmitted in a fourth symbol interval.<br>
In the structure shown in FIG 9A, the UE applies patterns of [+1] (901) and<br>
[+1] (902) to RS symbols in case 900 where it transmits only the CQI information<br>
over the uplink control channel. However, the UE applies patterns of [-1] (904) and<br>
[-1] (905) in case 903 where it transmits CQI and ACK/NACK information together<br>
over the uplink control channel. That is, for the cases 900 and 903, the UE applies<br>
RS symbol values having a 90° phase difference. Therefore, even though the UE<br>
transmitted control information and RS symbols with the format 900, when the ENB<br>
receives CQI and ACK/NACK information, misrecognizing that the format 903 was<br>
applied, the ENB estimates a channel from the RS symbol having a 180° phase error,<br>
thereby avoiding the false alarm that the ENB falsely detects the ACK/NACK<br>
information non-carried on the control channel transmitted by the UE. More<br>
specifically, when a codeword of the CQI channel transmitted by the UE is defined<br>
as X, normal decoding is almost impossible if the ENB performs channel estimation<br>
from the RS symbol values having the 180° phase difference before its demodulation,<br>
unless a codeword obtained by inverting 0 and 1 of each bit of the codeword X is<br>
generated when CQI and ACK/NACK are transmitted together.<br>
As illustrated in FIG 9B, although RS symbol patterns of [+1] (907) and [-1]<br>
(908) are applied in the first slot and the second slot, respectively, in case 906 where<br>
only the CQI is transmitted, and RS symbol patterns of [-1] (909) and [+1] (910) are<br>
applied in case 911 where CQI and ACK/NACK are transmitted together, the same<br>
180° phase difference occurs between the RS symbols for the two cases. It is not<br>
necessary that the RS symbols should have the 180° phase difference, and the UE<br>
only needs to apply patterns so as to have a proper phase difference between the RS<br>
symbol patterns for the two cases according to the channel coding scheme applied to<br>
the control channels.<br>
As illustrated in FIG 1, in the EUTRA uplink, when symbols of the first slot<br>
and the second slot are transmitted in different frequency bands, they undergo<br>
channel estimation independently on a slot-by-slot basis. Therefore, applying<br>
orthogonal patterns over two slots by applying the RS symbol patterns of [+1 +1]<br>
and [-1 -1] over RSI and RS2 for the cases 900 and 903, can hardly reduce the false<br>
alarm in the channel environment where the UE has a high mobility or stays in the<br>
urban areas. However, even such application of the RS symbol patterns is not<br>
excluded in the present invention, and this can reduce the false alarm in the channel<br>
environment where the UE has a low mobility and stays in the suburbs.<br>
FIGs. 10A and 10B are diagrams illustrating an RS structure for transmission<br>
of an uplink data channel according to an additional embodiment of the present<br>
invention. In this embodiment RS symbol patterns having an orthogonal relation<br>
over two slots are applied to the uplink data channels.<br>
In the EUTRA uplink, in order to satisfy the single-carrier transmission<br>
characteristic of SC-FDMA, when one UE should simultaneously transmit a data<br>
channel and a control channel in one subframe, the control channel symbols are<br>
transmitted in a transmission band of the data channel. In FIGs. 10A and 10B, the<br>
horizontal axis represents the time domain, and the vertical axis 1006 represents a<br>
bandwidth of an arbitrary uplink data channel Physical Uplink Shared Channel<br>
(PUSCH) #n.<br>
FIGs. 10A and 10B illustrate an embodiment in which different RS symbol<br>
patterns are applied for cases 1000 and 1010 where only data is transmitted in the<br>
PUSCH #n, and cases 1003 and 1013 where data is transmitted together with control<br>
information. RS is transmitted on the center symbol among 7 symbols in the slot. In<br>
FIG. 10A, symbols of [+1] (1001) and [+1] (1002) are transmitted on RSI and RS2,<br>
respectively, in the case 1000 where only data is transmitted in the PUSCH band<br>
1006, and symbols of [+1] (1004) and [-1] (1005) are transmitted on RSI and RS2,<br>
respectively, in the case 1003 where data and control information are transmitted<br>
together. That is, if an RS symbol pattern [RSI RS2] over the entire two slots is<br>
compared with the two cases, the resulting patterns become [+1 +1] and [+1 -1],<br>
respectively, maintaining the mutual orthogonal relation.<br>
By applying different RS symbol patterns according to the possible cases, it<br>
is possible to reduce the false alarm as described for the PUCCH in the foregoing<br>
embodiments. Similar to the embodiment of FIG. 4, even though the ENB has<br>
scheduled a downlink data packet to a certain UE through a downlink control<br>
channel, since it has failed to normally receive the control channel, the UE may<br>
transmit no ACK/NACK in the subframe where it will transmit ACK/NACK for the<br>
data packet. However, if the UE is scheduled an uplink data packet in the subframe,<br>
the UE transmits only the data channel without the ACK/NACK information in the<br>
subframe.<br>
When, even though the UE transmitted a data channel without control<br>
information by applying RS symbol patterns 1001 and 1002, the ENB misrecognizes<br>
that the UE transmitted the data channel together with control information, the ENB<br>
receiver performs channel compensation by estimating a channel different from the<br>
actual channel by applying RS symbol patterns 1004 and 1005, thus failing in<br>
demodulation of the data channel. In this case, the ENB can perceive that the UE<br>
transmitted only the data channel, if the ENB has succeeded in performing decoding<br>
on the received data channel after its channel estimation and channel compensation<br>
by applying the RS symbol patterns 1001 and 1002. An alternative method can<br>
compare an SNR of a channel estimate obtained from an RS symbol pattern<br>
considered for the case 1000 with an SNR of a channel estimate obtained from an RS<br>
symbol pattern considered for the case 1003 to check which case is higher in the<br>
SNR of the channel estimate, thereby determining whether the UE applied the<br>
transmission format for the case 1000 or the transmission format for the case 1003.<br>
Similarly to the second embodiment, the example of FIG. 10B applies RS<br>
symbol patterns having a 180° phase difference between the cases 1010 and 1013.<br>
Symbols of [+1] (1011) and [+1] (1012) are transmitted on RSI and RS2 in the case<br>
where 1010 the UE transmits only the data packet over the PUSCH, and symbols of<br>
[-1] (1014) and [-1] (1015) are transmitted in the case 1013 where data and control<br>
information are transmitted together. The RS symbol structure of FIG 10A is suitable<br>
for the case where the PUSCH is transmitted in the same frequency band both in the<br>
first slot and the second slot, and the RS symbol structure of FIG 10B is suitable for<br>
the case where the PUSCH, like the PUCCH, changes in its transmission band<br>
between the first slot and the second slot, i.e., undergoes frequency-hopping<br>
transmission.<br>
As is apparent from the foregoing description, when the UE transmits an<br>
uplink control channel in the wireless communication system, the embodiments of<br>
the present invention can remarkably reduce the error probability that even though<br>
the UE transmitted no ACK/NACK information, the ENB will falsely detect the<br>
ACK/NACK information, thereby preventing the problem that the downlink data<br>
packet that the UE has failed to receive is discarded in the ENB.<br>
In addition, according to the embodiments of the present invention, the ENB<br>
can correctly detect even the CQI information transmitted by the UE, thereby<br>
contributing to an increase in the downlink system capacity.<br>
While the invention has been shown and described with reference to a<br>

11. The apparatus as in claim 8, wherein the first value comprises an<br>
indication that CQI bits are transmitted.<br>
12. The apparatus as in claim 8, wherein the second value comprises an<br>
indication that CQI bits and acknowledgement bits are transmitted.<br>
13. The apparatus as in claim 8, wherein, when the first number of symbols<br>
is two, the first orthogonal cover is {1, 1}, and the second orthogonal cover is {1, -<br>
1}.<br>
14. The apparatus as in claim 8, wherein the communication system<br>
comprises a single-carrier frequency domain multiple access communication system.<br><br>
A method and apparatus for transmitting/receiving pilot symbols for<br>
demodulation of control channel information in the uplink of a wireless<br>
communication system are provided. When an Evolved Node B (ENB) expects<br>
to receive both the Channel Quality Information (CQI) and the<br>
Acknowledgement (ACK)/Negative ACK (NACK) from a User Equipment (UE)<br>
in a certain subframe, if the UE transmits only the CQI channel, the ENB is<br>
prevented to detect the nonexistent ACK/NACK information from the CQI<br>
channel, thereby avoiding false alarm.</td>
