DESCRIPTION<br>
Dye mixture comprising water-soluble fiber-reactive azo dyes, preparation thereof and use thereof<br>
This invention relates to the technical field of fiber-reactive azo dyes.<br>
EP-A 775732 and EP-A 94055 disclose dyes of the genera! formulae 1 and 2. However, these dyes have certain application defects, for example an excessive dependence of the color yield on changing dyeing parameters in the dyeing process, or an insufficient or unlevel color build-up on cotton (good color build-up results from the ability of a dye to produce a correspondingly stronger dye and from an increased dye concentration in the dyebath). Possible consequences of these shortcomings are poor reproducibilities for the dyeings which are obtainable.<br>
However, it is particularly important to obtain dyeings having a good color yield, i.e., dyeings whose depth of shade is very high in relation to the amount of dye used, because of the coloring property of the dye itself (high absorbance) and because of the dyeing characteristics of this dye, such as good affinity and high yield of fixation. When mixtures of dyes having a certain color yield are used, the color yield of this -mixture of dyes will generally be the average of the color yields of the individual dyes, which is why the color yield of a mixture of, for example, two dyes will be less than the color yield obtained when the dye having the larger color yield property is used as the only dye but in the total amount of the two individual dyes.<br>
!t has now been found that the color strength of the hereinbelow described dye mixtures according to the invention is surprisingly higher than the sum total of the color strengths afforded by the individual dyes in the mixture. This synergistic effect also shows itself in improved build-up characteristics on the part of the mixture of the invention compared with the individual dyes in the mixture.<br><br>
2<br>
True, synergistic mixtures are already known from EP-A 681002, but the mixtures described therein have certain application defects, for example an unlevel build-up in the cold pad-batch process, and also the staining of adjacent fabric, especially polyester, in continuous dyeing by the pad-steam process. This staining is undesirable because it means that, in commercial practice, the dyed material has to be subjected to several energy- and media-intensive (water) cleaning operations to remove the stains.<br>
The present invention, then, provides a way of reducing this undesirable staining while at the same time improving the build-up characteristics of the mixture according to the invention compared to the individual dyes in the mixture. These mixtures are notable for very good in-service fastnesses.<br>
The present invention accordingly provides dye mixtures comprising one or more azo dyes of the genera! formula (1) and one or more azo dyes of the general formula (2)<br><br><br>

In the general formulae indicated above and he rein below, the individual symbols, whether of different or identical designation within any one general formula, may have identical or different meanings under their definition.<br>
Generally the azo dye of the general formula (1) and the azo dye of the general formula (2) are present in the mixture in a mixing ratio of 90:10% by weight to 10:90% by weight, preferably in a ralio of 70:30% by weight to 30:70% by weight.

The -SO2Y group is preferably meta or para to the azo group. The dye mixtures of the invention can be present as a preparation in solid or in liquid (dissolved form). In solid form, they generally include the electrolyte salts customary for water-soluble and especially for fiber-reactive dyes, such as sodium chloride, potassium chloride and sodium sulfate, and may further include the auxiliaries customary in commercial dyes, such as buffer substances capable of setting a pH in aqueous solution between 3 and 7, such as sodium acetate, sodium borate, sodium bicarbonate, sodium dihydrogenphosphate, sodium tricitrate and disodium hydrogenphosphate, or small amounts of siccatives; when they are present in a liquid, aqueous solution (including the presence of thickeners of the type customary in print pastes) they may also include substances which ensure a long life for these preparations, for example mold preventatives.<br>
Generally the dye mixtures of the invention are present as dye powders containing 10 to 80% by weight, based on the dye powder or the preparation, of an electrolyte salt which is also referred to as a standardizing agent. These dye powders may additionally include the aforementioned buffer substances in a total amount of up to 10% by weight, based on the dye powder. When the dye mixtures of the invention are present in aqueous solution, the total dye content of these aqueous solutions will be up to about 50% by weight, for example between 5 and 50% by weight, and the electrolyte salt content of these aqueous solutions will preferably be below 10% by weight, based on the aqueous solution; the aqueous solutions (liquid preparations) may include the aforementioned buffer substances in an amount which is generally up to 10% by weight, preferably up to 2% by weight.<br>
The dye mixtures of the invention are preparable in a conventional manner, for instance by mechanically mixing the individual dyes known from the abovementioned EP-As in solid or in liquid form in the requisite proportions, or by synthesis by means<br><br>
6<br>
of the customary diazotization and coupling reactions and conversion reactions with the halotriazine component using corresponding mixtures of such components in a manner known to one of ordinary skill in the art and using the requisite quantitative proportions.<br>
Synthesis may be effected, for example, by reacting a 2,4,6-trihalotriazine, especially 2,4,6-trichloro- or 2,4,6-trifluoro-triazine, first in a conventional manner with 1 -amino-8-naphtho!-3,6-disulfonic acid and then with a diazonium salt prepared in a well-known manner from an amine of the general formula (3A) or (3B)<br><br>
where R1, R2, R3, R4, Y1 and Y2 are each as defined above, then reacting the reaction product from the reaction with a diazotized amine of the formula (3A) by reaction with one or more amino compounds of the general formula A-NH-B, where A and B are each as defined above, or to prepare the component of the general formula (2) introducing the fragment D-T in a known manner in the reaction product from the reaction with a diazotized amino compound of the formula (3B), then reacting this reaction product with an amine of the general formula (3C)<br><br>
in a conventional manner and coupling with the diazonium salt of the amines of the general formula (3D) in a known manner to form the bisazo dye.<br><br>
7<br><br>
Dyes of the general formula (1) and (2) where X1 and X2 are not halogen are converted by reacting the mixture with the compounds HOR3 or HNR3R4 in a conventional manner, for example at a temperature between 10 and 100°C, preferably between 40 and 80°C, and at a pH between 3 and 7, preferably between 4 and 5.<br>
The separation from their synthesis solution of the chemically prepared dye mixtures of the invention can be effected according to generally known methods, for example either by precipitating from the reaction medium by means of electrolytes, for example sodium chloride or potassium chloride, or by evaporating or spray-drying the reaction solution, in which case this reaction solution may have a buffer substance added to it.<br>
The dye mixtures of the invention have useful application properties. They are used for dyeing or printing hydroxyl- and/or carboxamido-containing materials, for example in the form of sheetlike structures, such as paper and leather or of films, for example composed of polyamide, or in bulk, as for example of polyamide and polyurethane, but especially for dyeing or printing these materials in fiber form. Similarly, the solutions of the dye mixtures of the invention that are obtained in the synthesis of the azo compounds, if appropriate after addition of a buffer substance and if appropriate after concentrating or diluting, can be used directly as liquid preparation for dyeing<br>
The present invention thus also relates to the use of the dye mixtures of the invention for dyeing or printing these materials, or rather to processes for dyeing or printing these materials in a conventional manner, by using a dye mixture of the invention as colorant. The materials are preferably employed in the form of fiber<br><br>
8<br>
materials, especially in the form of textile fibers, such as woven fabrics or yarns, as in the form of hanks or wound packages.<br>
Hydroxyl-containing materials are those of natural or synthetic origin, for example cellulose fiber materials or their regenerated products and polyvinyl alcohols. Cellulose fiber materials are preferably cotton, but also other vegetable fibers, such as linen, hemp, jute and ramie fibers; regenerated cellulose fibers are for example staple viscose and filament viscose.<br>
Carboxamido-containing materials are for example synthetic and natural polyamides and polyurethanes, especially in the form of fibers, for example wool and other animal hairs, silk, leather, polyamide-6,6, polyamide-6, polyamide-11 and polyamide-4.<br>
The dye mixtures of the invention can be applied to and fixed on the substrates mentioned, especially the fiber materials mentioned, by the application techniques known for water-soluble dyes, especially fiber-reactive dyes. For instance, on cellulose fibers they produce by the exhaust method from a long liquor using various acid-binding agents and optionally neutral salts, such as sodium chloride or sodium sulfate, dyeings having very good color yields which are improved compared with the individual dyes. Application is preferably from an aqueous bath at temperatures between 40 and 105°C, optionally at a temperature of up to 130°C under superatmospheric pressure, and optionally in the presence of customary dyeing auxiliaries.<br>
One possible procedure is to introduce the material into the warm bath and to gradually heat the bath to the desired dyeing temperature and to complete the dyeing process at that temperature. The neutral salts v/hich accelerate the exhaustion of the dyes may also, if desired, only be added to the bath after the actual dyeing temperature has been reached.<br>
The padding process likewise provides excellent color yields and very good color build-up on cellulose fibers, the dyes being allowed to become fixed on the material<br><br>
by batching at room temperature or at elevated temperature, for example at up to 60°C, by steaming or using dry heat in a conventional manner.<br>
Similarly, the customary printing processes for cellulose fibers, which can be carried out either single-phase, for example by printing with a print paste comprising sodium bicarbonate or some other acid-binding agent and by subsequent steaming at 100 to 103°C, or two-phase, for example by printing with a neutral or weakly acidic print color and subsequent fixation either by passing the printed material through a hot electrolyte-comprising alkaline bath or by overpadding with an alkaline electrolyte-comprising padding liquor with subsequent batching of the alkali-overpadded material or subsequent steaming or subsequent treatment with dry heat, produce strong prints with well-defined contours and a clear white ground. The appearance of the prints is not greatly affected by variations in the fixing conditions.<br>
When fixing by means of dry heat in accordance with 1he customary thermofix processes, hot air from 120 to 200°C is used. In addition to the customary steam at 101 to 103°C it is also possible to use superheated steam and high-pressure steam at temperatures of up to 160°C.<br>
The acid-binding agents which effect the fixation of the dyes of the dye mixtures of the invention on the cellulose fibers include for example water-soluble basic salts of the alkali metals and likewise alkaline earth metals of inorganic or organic acids or compounds which liberate alkali in the heat. Especially suitable are the alkali metal hydroxides and alkali metal salts of weak to medium inorganic or organic acids, the preferred alkali metal compounds being the sodium and potassium compounds. Such acid-binding agents include for example sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, sodium carbonate, sodium bicarbonate, potassium carbonate, sodium formate, sodium dihydrogenphosphate, disodium hydrogenphosphate, sodium trichloroacetate, waterglass or trisodium phosphate.<br>
The dye mixtures of the invention are notable for a high yield of fixation when applied to the cellulose fiber materials by dyeing or printing. The cellulose dyeings obtained<br><br>
10<br>
following the customary aftertreatment by rinsing to remove unfixed dye portions exhibit excellent wetfastnesses, in particular since such unfixed dye portions are easily washed off on account of their good solubility in cold water.<br>
The dyeings and prints obtainable with the dye mixtures of the invention have bright hues; especially the dyeings and prints on cellulose fiber materials have good lightfastness and very good wetfastnesses, such as wash, milling, water, seawater, crossdyeing and acidic and also alkaline perspiration fastness properties, also good fastness to pleating, hotpressing and rubbing.<br>
Furthermore, the dye mixtures of the invention can also be used for the fiber-reactive dyeing of wool. Moreover, wool which has been given a nonfelting or low-felting finish (cf. for example H. Rath, Lehrbuch der Textilchemie, Springer-Verlag, 3rd Edition (1972), p. 295-299, especially the finish by the Hercosett process (p. 298); J. Soc. Dyers and Colorists 1972, 93-99, and 1975, 33-44) can be dyed with very good fastness properties.<br>
The process of dyeing on wool is here carried out in a conventional manner from an acidic medium. For instance, acetic acid and/or ammonium sulfate or acetic acid and ammonium acetate or sodium acetate may be added to the dyebath to obtain the desired pH. To obtain a dyeing of acceptable levelness, it is advisable to add a customary leveling agent, for example on the basis of a reaction product of cyanuric chloride with 3 times the molar amount of an aminobenzenesulfonic acid and/or of an aminonaphthalenesulfonic acid or on the basis of a reaction product of for example stearylamine with ethylene oxide. For instance, the dye mixture of the invention is preferably subjected to the exhaust process initially from an acidic dyebath having a pH of about 3.5 to 5.5 under pH control and the pH is then, toward the end of the dyeing time, shifted into the neutral and optionally weakly alkaline range up to a pH of 8.5 to bring about, especially for very deep dyeings, the full reactive bond between the dyes of the dye mixtures of the invention and the fiber. At the same time, the dye portion not reactively bound is removed.<br><br>
11<br>
The procedure described herein also applies to the production of dyeings on fiber materials composed of other natural polyamides or of synthetic polyamides and polyurethanes. In general, the material to be dyed is introduced into the bath at a temperature of about 40°C, agitated therein for some time, the dyebath is then adjusted to the desired weakly acidic, preferably weakly acetic acid, pH and the actual dyeing is carried out at a temperature between 60 and 98°C. However, the dyeings can also be carried out at the boil or in sealed dyeing apparatus at temperatures of up to 106°C. Since the water solubility of the dye mixtures of the invention is very good, they can also be used with advantage in customary continuous dyeing processes. The color strength of the dye mixtures of the invention is very high.<br>
The dye mixtures of the invention dye the materials mentioned, preferably fiber materials, in bright red to bluish red shades.<br>
The examples hereinbelow serve to illustrate the invention. Parts and percentages are by weight, unless otherwise stated. Parts by weight relate to parts by volume as the kilogram relates to the liter. The compounds described in the examples in terms of a formula are indicated in the form of free acids; in general these dyes are prepared and isolated in the form of their salts, preferably sodium or potassium salts, and used for dyeing in the form of their salts.<br>
