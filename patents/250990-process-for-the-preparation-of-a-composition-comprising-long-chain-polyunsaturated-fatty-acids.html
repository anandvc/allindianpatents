				<td>PROCESS FOR THE PREPARATION OF A COMPOSITION COMPRISING<br>
UNSATURATED COMPOUNDS<br>
******<br>
The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of a<br>
composition comprising unsaturated compounds, in particular<br>
polyunsaturated compounds, which comprises concentrating and<br>
purifying the compounds.<br>
It is known that unsaturated compounds, in particular the<br>
polyunsaturated ones, are scarcely stable and easily deteriorated,<br>
amongst others, by atmospheric agents, because of their own reactivity<br>
and oxidability on double bonds, with subsequent production of polar<br>
oxidation by-products and induction of polymerization.<br>
Among the most instable unsaturated compounds comprised in the<br>
composition obtained by the process of the invention, the natural and<br>
non-natural oils, of both animal and vegetable origin as well as the<br>
products of their chemical modification, like fish and seed oils<br>
(triglycerides), the fatty acids and salts thereof obtained by hydrolysis, the<br>
alkyl esters thereof obtained by synthesis or by transesterification, as well<br>
as any of the derivatives thereof, can be mentioned.<br>
In particular, the family of the compounds deriving from the<br>
polyunsaturated fatty acids of the ω-3 series, such as, for instance, the α-<br>
linolenic acid (ALA, C18:4 Ω-3, all cis), the eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA,<br>
C20:5 Ω-3, all cis), and the docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, C22:6 Ω-3, all<br>
cis), and from the polyunsaturated fatty acids of the ω-6 series, as well as<br>
the pharmaceutically and dietetically acceptable derivatives thereof,<br>
typically the salts and the C1-C3 alkyl esters thereof, can be mentioned.<br>
Among said derivatives, the EPA ethyl ester and/or DHA ethyl ester,<br>
alone or in mixture, or even in the presence of other ethyl esters of<br>
quantitatively minor ω-3 series compounds, are of particular interest for<br>
their use in the pharmaceutical field and as dietetic integrators.<br>
The natural oils containing fatty acids in the form of glycerides are<br>
usually submitted to standard treatments, as extraction, whitening,<br>
deodorization, etc. The polyunsaturated compounds, as -for instance- the<br>
above mentioned acids, being in mixture with high quantities of saturated<br><br>
and mono-unsaturated components, arc usually isolated from glycerides<br>
through hydrolysis or through transesterification and concentrated, for<br>
instance by complexing the less unsaturated constituents with urea or by<br>
other techniques, chemically modified to derivatives, if requested, and<br>
then purified by distillation: however, all these steps damage heavily and<br>
at the same time the polyunsaturated compound structure and lead to<br>
forming high quantities of by-products with polar structure, which sum<br>
themselves to the other preexistent impurities of natural oils or deriving<br>
by the environmental polluting agents.<br>
Among the instability factors, the atmospheric agents, essentially air<br>
oxygen, as well as other oxidizing agents, oxidation catalysts, such as<br>
copper and iron; sunlight exposure, hydrolytic agents and the like, can be<br>
mentioned. Actually, also many chemical and physical agents, used in the<br>
extraction steps of such unsaturated compounds from the natural<br>
sources, as well as in the concentration steps and also in the purification<br>
steps, can induce some degradation, so forming oxidation and<br>
polymerization products. The effect of heating is also particularly<br>
dangerous, so that also distillation -while permitting to discard the lower<br>
boiling and higher boiling fractions from the oily matrix- induces by itself<br>
a high degradation and forming of polymeric residues.<br>
To partially limit such problems, at least in the final steps of the<br>
production, molecular distillation is carried out, which is however<br>
disadvantageous because of the plant and managing costs and of its<br>
limited productivity. In the commercializing steps, storage in tightly<br>
closed containers, protected from air and from sunlight, and under inert<br>
gas is also adopted. The addition of antioxidants, like for instance<br>
tocoferol is also usual.<br>
The polar degradation derivatives are therefore present in the raw<br>
materials or are formed in the extraction, concentration, purification<br>
steps, as well as during any further step of either chemical or generic<br>
manipulation. Among such polar degradation derivatives, most of them<br>
having a complex and not completely elucidated structure, we can<br>
mention the hydroxy- derivatives on the double bond, the epoxides and<br>
peroxides, the last ones being deemed as potentially dangerous to health,<br><br>
in view of their atherogenic and mutagenic activities (see f . i. Carroll KK,<br>
Cancer Res. 1975; 35, 3374). Other process by-products are represented<br>
by several oligomers and polymers with complex structures, deriving by<br>
said double bond oxidation products through different mechanisms<br>
involving intermolecular reactions. These polymerization products<br>
represent the most abundant by-products and may reach amounts of 20-<br>
30% or more.<br>
Completely foreign impurities, of environmental origin, but always<br>
present, particularly in fish oils and in all their transformation derivatives,<br>
are represented by several toxins, as aflatoxin, hydrocarbons as<br>
benzopyrene, pesticides as DDT, industrial agents as PCB and dioxin<br>
(McEwen FL, Stephenson GR, The use and significance of pesticides in<br>
the environment, Chapter 15. New York, Wiley 1979, 260-348), metallic<br>
ions and metallorganic compounds as mercury and methylmercury<br>
(Bolger PM, Schwetz BA, N Engl J Med 2002; 347, 1735), and many other<br>
marine pollutants, all clearly noxious to health if ingested as food and /or<br>
as drug. Other polar derivatives can be constituted by acids deriving from<br>
hydrolysis of triglycerides or esters, etc.<br>
To avoid the presence of many foreign substances and by-products in<br>
vegetable and animal oils, traditionally used for alimentary purpose, the<br>
chemical practice obliged for decades the control of defined parameters as<br>
acidity index, peroxide index, iodine index, the search of heavy metals, as<br>
mercury and lead and of pesticides, anisidine index, etc.<br>
After the recent development of the derivatives of polyunsaturated<br>
fatty acids, more easily oxidized and degraded, as pharmaceutical<br>
products, it is now deemed appropriate to carry out a chromatographic<br>
analysis determining not only the so-called "gaschromatographic purity",<br>
which is indeed an apparent assay (percent ratio of the peak area of each<br>
component to the total area of the chromatogram), but even its "true<br>
assay" (absolute assay) determined against a pure standard: also the<br>
absolute area of the test derivative peak is thus controlled, this technique<br>
guaranteeing, in other words, that substantial impurity quantities are not<br>
retained in the chromatographic column escaping the instrumental<br>
control.<br><br>
The recent European Pharmacopoeia 2000 (E. P. 2000), in its<br>
monograph "Omega-3 acid ethyl esters", a mixture of ethyl esters of<br>
omega-3 polyunsaturated acids, typically represented by EPA and DHA,<br>
prescribes the direct control of the oxidation and polymerization by-<br>
products (defined "oligomers", as a whole, which are not detectable by<br>
gaschromatographic route), by means of a specific exclusion<br>
chromatography in liquid phase (gel permeation GPC, well known in the<br>
art). We will refer hereafter to such specific chromatographic procedures,<br>
carried out as described in E. P. 2000.<br>
Coming back to the unsaturated substances object of the process of<br>
the invention, just a few of them can be found and extracted from natural<br>
products already in high concentration, as oleic acid (monounsaturated)<br>
from olive oil; many others are found in low to medium concentration, as<br>
arachidonic acid (polyunsaturated, ω-6) in the borage oil, and as EPA and<br>
DHA (polyunsaturated, ω-3) in fish oil, where they can be present till to a<br>
maximum of 10-20%, as it is easily documented by literature.<br>
The processing of extracted oils (triglycerides) is usually carried out<br>
by hydrolysis to acids or by transesterification to esters; acids and esters<br>
can be used as such or undergone to chemical modification according to<br>
methods known in the art, to give a wide range of derivatives. Frequently,<br>
more often during the first steps of the processing, the lower concentrated<br>
polyunsaturated substances are partially concentrated f. i. by complexing<br>
them with urea and then fractioning/removing the saturated and<br>
monounsaturated components, by means of procedures already well-<br>
known to the expert by many decades (see Swern D, Techniques of<br>
Separation - Urea Mixtures, in "Fatty Acids", part 3, Ed. KS Markley,<br>
Interscience, New York, 1963; pages 2309-2358), or even by means of<br>
distillation.<br>
Further concentration and final purification are usually carried out<br>
by under-vacuum distillation which results to be complicated by severe<br>
pyrolytic effects on the unstable unsaturated structures, or by molecular<br>
distillation, which limits indeed and yet does not eliminate the thermic<br>
degradation and, however, implies expensive plant and managing plant<br>
costs and limited productive capacity.<br><br>
Fractioning with urea and molecular distillation are the techniques,<br>
pointed out in the above mentioned monograph, for compositions based<br>
on EPA ethyl ester, DHA ethyl ester and other minor components of the<br>
ω-3 series. Other occasionally used purification techniques imply the<br>
extraction and purification with supercritical fluids, Craig counter current<br>
chromatography, and high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC).<br>
The most relevant patent literature describes what has already been<br>
mentioned, as distillation is the final and essential phase to concentration<br>
and/or to purification in almost all cases.<br>
For example, US 4377526 describes a process for the purification of<br>
EPA and the esters thereof, involving the treatment with urea, followed by<br>
a fractioned distillation. Percentages of EPA higher than 70% are obtained,<br>
while DHA is present at 3-5%.<br>
US 4554107 and US 4623488 describe a method based on the<br>
technique of molecular distillation: fish oil, enriched in EPA and DHA,<br>
with a rather low yield (30%) because of the drastic experimental<br>
conditions, is obtained.<br>
US 5130061 relates to a process to obtain EPA and DHA as ethyl<br>
esters from crude fish oils, through transesterification with ethanol and<br>
acid catalyst (H2SO4), chromatography on silica gel and molecular<br>
distillation. Distillation is the essential step of the process, to remove EPA<br>
and DHA ethyl esters impurities (concentration 35-40%, Example 3), and<br>
to increase their concentration from 40-50% to 80-90% (Examples 4-8)<br>
and DHA ethyl ester concentration to 90-96% (Examples 9-10).<br>
Also EP-B-0409903 claims a process, through which oils of animal<br>
and/or vegetable origin are undergone to alkaline hydrolysis and the<br>
obtained acids are undergone to one or more steps of molecular<br>
distillation. The patent points out some prior art processes, based on the<br>
use of urea for the precipitation and selective elimination of less<br>
unsaturated acids (WO 87/03899, JP 57-187397) or on the extraction<br>
with supercritical fluids (JP 60-214757, JP 60-115698).<br>
Further processes of chromatographic type are reported in the<br>
following patents: JP 61-291540 uses an absorbent resin composed of a<br>
non-polar porous polymer (styrene-divinylbenzene copolymer) and an<br><br>
eluent, containing a hydrophilic polar solvent, preferably methanol,<br>
suitably modified, to fraction the required polyunsaturated acid or its<br>
ester.<br>
JP 61-037752 uses a chromatographic process on a co-polymer,<br>
containing monovinyl and polyvinyl aromatic monomers.<br>
JP 58-109444 uses chromatographic columns, composed of a carrier<br>
made of silica gel or synthetic polymers (preferably substituted by an<br>
octadecyl radical), suitable for a reverse-phase repartition<br>
chromatography, and polar eluents, including water, alcohols and other<br>
solvents.<br>
Finally, IT 1235879 claims a process, to obtain a particular<br>
composition of EPA, DHA and other minor components of ω-3 series,<br>
already present in natural fish oil, according to which the known<br>
techniques of transesterification, concentration -preferably through a<br>
treatment with urea- and molecular distillation are used in free order.<br>
In view of the above prior art, it is believed that the real absolute<br>
purity of the obtained products has never been taken into consideration,<br>
with the exception of some occasional gaschromatographic data.<br>
For this reason, we believe it is reasonable to think the authors were<br>
referring to the simple or apparent gaschromatographic purity, so that -<br>
presumably unaware- such processes led to a more far away quality than<br>
the supposed one and to products highly contaminated by impurities and<br>
polluting agents, and above all, by the already mentioned polar products<br>
of degradation (oxidation/polymerization), which are not detectable<br>
through gaschromatography, but only through liquid chromatography of<br>
exclusion, briefly reported as "oligomers", according to E.P. 2000.<br>
It has been now surprisingly found a process for the preparation of a<br>
composition comprising unsaturated compounds with a assay higher<br>
than 50% by weight -considered as the absolute assay, according to what<br>
above illustrated-, wherein the starting unsaturated compounds are first<br>
concentrated up to a gaschromatographic purity corresponding to the<br>
assay required for the final unsaturated compounds and then purified by<br>
contact with silicon and/or aluminium derivatives.<br>
The process of the invention allows to get purified unsaturated<br><br>
compounds by simply contacting them with silicon and/ or aluminium<br>
derivatives, without the need of any further manipulation to increase<br>
neither the concentration nor the purity of the unsaturated compounds,<br>
likely because of the high binding capacity of the polar by-products of the<br>
process, of the products of polymerization and of the other<br>
impurities/pollutants with the above mentioned silicon and/or<br>
aluminium derivatives.<br>
The unsaturated compounds are preferably polyunsaturated<br>
compounds; it is also preferred that the composition has a content of<br>
oligomeric impurities lower than 30% by weight, in particular lower than<br>
15% by weight.<br>
In the present specification, the expression 'oligomeric impurities' is<br>
meant to comprise also other foreign impurities not detectable through<br>
gaschromatography.<br>
The polyunsaturated compounds are more preferably long-chain<br>
polyunsaturated fatty acids of the ω-3 and/or ω-6 series and/or the<br>
pharmaceutically and/or dietetically acceptable derivatives thereof<br>
(including the glycerides containing them); in particular, such long-chain<br>
polyunsaturated fatty acids contain also monounsaturated and/or<br>
saturated compounds.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment, the long-chain<br>
polyunsaturated fatty acids of the ω-3 series -comprised in the<br>
composition with a assay higher than 50% by weight- are selected from<br>
the group consisting of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, C20:5 ω-3, all cis)<br>
and/or docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, C22:6 ω-3, all cis) and/or the<br>
pharmaceutically and/or dietetically acceptable derivatives thereof,<br>
whereas the long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids of the Ω-3 series -<br>
comprised in the composition with a assay lower than 50% by weight- are<br>
selected from the group consisting of C18:3 ω-3 and/or C18:4 ω-3 and/or<br>
C20:4 ω-3 and/or C21:5 Ω-3 and/or C22:5 ω-3 acids, and/or the<br>
pharmaceutically and/or dietetically acceptable derivatives thereof.<br>
The derivatives of the long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids are<br>
preferably selected from the group consisting of the C1-C3 alkyl esters<br>
and/or glyceric esters and/or the salts thereof with an inorganic or<br><br>
organic base (sodium, lysine, arginine, choline salts, and the like); the<br>
ethyl esters being most preferred.<br>
According to another preferred embodiment, EPA and/or DHA,<br>
and/or the derivatives thereof are concentrated up to a<br>
gaschromatographic purity higher than 75%, in particular higher than<br>
80%, more preferably higher than 85% and most preferably higher than<br>
90% by weight.<br>
Also variable quantities of ethyl esters of minor ω-3 components, as<br>
described in the above-mentioned monograph of E.P. 2000, as well as ω-6,<br>
monounsaturated and saturated ethyl esters, usually in quantities even<br>
more limited could be present in the composition obtained by carrying out<br>
the process of the invention.<br>
In particular, such composition has a content of oligomeric<br>
impurities (as well as the other by-products of the process) lower than 2%,<br>
more preferably lower than 1.5%, most preferably lower than 1% by<br>
weight, according to the analytic specifications required by each<br>
commercial products.<br>
Foreign impurities, for example those deriving from environmental<br>
pollutants, such as heavy metals, usually measured in concentrations of<br>
"parts per million" (ppm), will always be conform to the analytic<br>
specifications, in particular the ones of E. P. 2000. A typical composition,<br>
obtained by the process of the invention, having an iodine index higher<br>
than 320, will have f. i. an acidity index not higher than 2, peroxide index<br>
not higher than 20, anisidine index not higher than 20; as well as heavy<br>
metals not higher than 10 ppm, Hg and Pb not higher than 1 ppm,<br>
pesticides not higher than 2 ppm.<br>
The ratio of EPA to DHA, and/or the derivatives thereof is preferably<br>
between 2:1 and 1:2, more preferably between 1.5:1 and 0.9:1.<br>
EPA and/or the derivatives thereof are preferably at least 40% by<br>
weight and usually range between 40 and 60% by weight, whereas DHA<br>
and/or the derivatives thereof usually range between 25 and 50% by<br>
weight and are preferably at least 34% by weight.<br>
According to a further preferred embodiment, the EPA and DHA ethyl<br>
esters assay is at least 80% by weight, the EPA ethyl ester assay being at<br><br>
least 40% by weight and the DHA ethyl ester assay being at least 34% by<br>
weight; the total ω-3 acids ethyl esters assay being at least 90% by weight.<br>
The EPA and DHA ethyl ester assay is preferably higher than 85% by<br>
weight.<br>
A still further preferred embodiment of the process of the invention<br>
provides that minor ω-3 components, with C20, C21, C22 (or also C18)<br>
structure (meaning both acids and/or the derivatives thereof), can be<br>
present in a content higher than 1%, preferably higher than 3% by weight,<br>
as described in IT 1235879, or be in total (C18:3 ω-3, C18:4 ω-3, C20:4<br>
ω-3, C21:5 ω-3, C22:5 ω-3) about 10%, as reported in the already above<br>
mentioned E. P. 2000.<br>
In carrying out the process of the invention, the starting unsaturated<br>
compounds may be concentrated by one- or two- step fractioned<br>
complcxing with urea; further, the resulting concentrated unsaturated<br>
compounds being preferably dissolved in aprotic and/or apolar and/or<br>
poorly polar solvents before being purified, the solvent being selected, in<br>
particular, from the group consisting of n-alkane, iso-alkane or cycle—<br>
alkane. Among the preferred solvents, a C5-C8 alkane such as n-hexane<br>
or cyclo-hexane, can be mentioned.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment, the purification is carried out<br>
by contacting the concentrated unsaturated compounds with the silicon<br>
and/or aluminium derivatives in batch, under stirring; alternatively, the<br>
purification is carried out by percolating the concentrated unsaturated<br>
compounds through the silicon and/or aluminium derivatives.<br>
The purification is carried out preferably at 10-40oC, in particular at<br>
20-25°C, for a time between 5 minutes to 24 hours, in particular for 0.1-4<br>
hours; further, the purification is advantageously carried out in the dark<br>
and in the absence of oxygen.<br>
The silicon and aluminium derivatives preferred for carrying out the<br>
process of the invention have, typically, any granulometry, porosity, grade,<br>
strength and type and are selected from the group consisting of silica gel;<br>
basic, acid or neutral alumina; also their derivatives useful as adsorbents<br>
on the basis of bipolar interactions such as, f. i., the silicate, aluminate,<br>
and silico-aluminate of such derivatives can be mentioned as well; in<br><br>
particular, the silicon and aluminium derivatives are Florisil® and/or<br>
Chromosorbs® and/or Zeolites®.<br>
According to another preferred embodiment, the process of the<br>
invention comprises, after the purification, concentrating the resulting<br>
unsaturated compounds at a temperature lower than the boiling point of<br>
the solvent and at a pressure lower than 200 mm Hg and then<br>
evaporating to dryness under vacuum or inert gas flow.<br>
Also preferred is including the composition obtained by the process of<br>
the invention in a pharmaceutically and/or dietetically acceptable vehicle<br>
and/or excipient and/or diluent; the composition being preferably in the<br>
form of soft gel capsules.<br>
The composition obtained by carrying out the process of the<br>
invention can be used for the preparation of a pharmaceutical formulation<br>
for the prevention and/or treatment and/or prophylaxis of multiple risk<br>
factors for cardiovascular diseases, such as hypertriglyceridemia,<br>
hypercholesterolemia, and hypertension, and of cardiovascular diseases,<br>
such as arrhythmia and atrial and/or ventricular fibrillation,<br>
decompensation and cardiac insufficiency; for the primary and secondary<br>
prevention of sudden death of cardiac origin and secondary prevention of<br>
re-infarction; for the treatment of every other pathology already known as<br>
being sensitive to the compositions of EPA and/or DHA or their<br>
derivatives, such as autoimmune illnesses, ulcerative cholitis, tumor<br>
pathology, nervous system illnesses, cell aging, cerebral infarct, ischemic<br>
diseases, psoriasis.<br>
As it is known, the composition can be used to prepare<br>
pharmaceutical and/or dietetic formulations suitable for topic, parenteral<br>
or oral use, preferably made of soft gel capsules, and contain 250-1500,<br>
preferably 300-1000 mg of the composition obtained by carrying out the<br>
process of the invention.<br>
Any other known composition comprising unsaturated compounds<br>
having a assay higher than 50%, can be obtained, in the above specified<br>
limits, by the process of the invention which leads to compounds which<br>
can be used for all pharmaceutical and para-pharmaceutical uses<br>
(dietetics, etc.) as described in the prior art.<br><br>
According to the invention, the raw materials have to show a<br>
minimum content, measured as gaschromatographic purity, higher than<br>
50% and, in general, equal to the assay required for the finished<br>
compound. It will easily be possible to an average man skilled in the art to<br>
prepare such raw materials through methods known in literature. For<br>
example, a composition of EPA and DHA ethyl esters will easily be<br>
obtained through direct transesterification, with ethanol and a catalyst,<br>
preferably an alkaline one, of the triglycerides of certain fish oils (sardine,<br>
mackerel, codfish, salmon oils, etc.; having, for instance, a content of<br>
about 12-18% by weight of EPA and of about 8-12% by weight of DHA),<br>
according to known methods (Lehman LW, Gauglitz EJ jr., Journal Am.<br>
Oil Chem. Soc., 41, 533, 1964).<br>
Starting from such compositions having an overall content of 20-30%<br>
by weight of EPA and DHA ethyl esters, it would be easy for an average<br>
man skilled in the art to obtain compositions with higher concentration,<br>
f.i. higher than 50% by weight, according to methods known in the art (f.<br>
i., Abu-Nasr AM et al., Journal Am. Oil Chem. Soc., 31, 16, 1954), f. i. by<br>
complexing with urea, followed by isolation and discharging of saturated<br>
and monounsaturated components, or by other methods.<br>
In the above mentioned case, by modifying the urea quantities and<br>
other experimental parameters, it is possible to reach compositions of<br>
EPA and DHA ethyl esters, even higher than 50% or even 75, 80, 85, 90%;<br>
all these compositions being useful as raw materials to the purposes of<br>
the process of the invention which, as mentioned above, can be carried<br>
out even in just one step. Anyway, the compositions having a total<br>
concentration of EPA and DHA ethyl esters of 50% by weight, already<br>
available on the market, can be, at their turn, concentrated to 75, 80, 85,<br>
90% by weight or more (particularly, when the minor ω-3 components are<br>
included), as requested, by means of complexing with urea, wasting<br>
saturated and monounsaturated esters, and enrichment of<br>
polyunsaturated esters in a further step of preparation.<br>
It is worth noting that the above reported concentrations represent<br>
the "apparent assays" of the compositions, which actually -if obtained<br>
according to literature procedures, particularly by concentration through<br><br>
urea complcxing and if not submitted to additional careful phase of<br>
purification- are always undoubtedly contaminated by substantial<br>
quantities of "oligomers" as above defined and by other impurities. As<br>
mentioned above, the presence of oligomers can be occasionally ranged<br>
between 1 and 30%, depending on the process undergone and on the<br>
work accuracy: only their presence as well as the apparent assay higher<br>
than 50%, involve their use as starting unsaturated compounds in both<br>
steps of purification and concentration of the process of the invention.<br>
Oligomers in a relatively low range, between 1 and 2%, can therefore<br>
characterize both the starting and the final unsaturated compounds,<br>
depending on the desired specifications.<br>
In the above mentioned case of compositions based, f. i., on EPA and<br>
DHA ethyl esters, the above starting material may be used as such, in oily<br>
form, or is preferably dissolved in 3-50 volumes, usually 5-20 volumes, of<br>
an aprotic and/or apolar and/or poorly polar solvent, as above mentioned.<br>
According to the process of the invention, the unsaturated<br>
compounds are then preferably contacted and/or percolated on inorganic<br>
substrates as silicon and aluminium derivatives, so inducing a chemo-<br>
physical link with the polar by-products contained, as well as their<br>
isolation and removing.<br>
In other words, the capacity to interact and to link (to bind) polar<br>
derivatives of unsaturated compounds, particularly oxidation polar<br>
derivatives and mainry of oligomeric and polymeric type, with inorganic<br>
substrates -typicalry represented by silicon and aluminium derivatives-<br>
allows to obtain a composition which is unexpectedly free of noxious by-<br>
products.<br>
The process of the invention is therefore deemed to represent an<br>
advantageous substitute of the usual distillation processes, coupled or<br>
not to chromatographic processes.<br>
It is also possible to adopt a so-called "batch process', in this case,<br>
preferably under slow stirring, or more preferably by percolation through<br>
the silicon or aluminium derivative, with a flow speed depending on the<br>
involved volumes, which is not anyway generally critical for the process.<br>
The process of the invention cannot be defined as a 'chromatographic<br><br>
process', because neither fractioning nor discharging of foreign material is<br>
requested, since the link of polar and/or oligomeric and/or foreign by-<br>
products is strongly selective and specific. In the process of the invention,<br>
the solution contacted with the silicon or aluminium derivative can be<br>
collected as a unique solution, the gaschromatographic composition<br>
remaining substantially unchanged, differently from the distillation<br>
processes. This solution is then preferably evaporated to dryness, at a<br>
temperature Lower than the boiling point of the solvent and at a pressure<br>
lower than 200 mm Hg, according to methods known to the average man<br>
skilled in the art, and any residual solvent is definitely eliminated, mixing<br>
up the oily mass by means of vacuum or inert gas, till a content lower<br>
than the one provided in the adopted specifications or fixed by the<br>
commercial use or by Pharmacopoeias.<br>
The composition thus obtained has then the absolute purity as<br>
requested, it does not need any further purification and can be used as<br>
such for all indications and pharmaceutical and para-pharmaceutical<br>
formulations known in the prior art.<br>
The composition obtained according to the process of the invention,<br>
in particular the composition of EPA and DHA ethyl esters, is therefore<br>
conform to the commercial products obtained by molecular distillation<br>
and to the products already known for pharmaceutical, para-<br>
pharmaceutical, dietetic, alimentary use, etc. as, f. i., the ones described<br>
in EP-B-0292846, EP-B-0409903, IT 1235879, EP-B-1152755, partly<br>
already mentioned, as well as in the mentioned monograph of E. P. 2000.<br>
Therefore, it could be used -for example- in the treatment or the<br>
prevention of multiple risk factors for cardiovascular diseases, as<br>
disclosed in IT 1235879, in the secondary prevention of cardiovascular<br>
events, mortality and sudden death in already infarcted patients, as<br>
described in EP-B-1152755, in the prevention and the treatment of other<br>
cardiac pathologies, as cardiac insufficiency and decompensation, as<br>
reported in EP-A-1365841, as well as in the primary cardiac prevention,<br>
in the arrhythmia and atrial and/or ventricular fibrillation treatment, and<br>
in all other known therapeutic and non-therapeutic indications, (dietetic,<br>
alimentary, etc.).<br><br>
The following examples illustrate the invention without limiting it.<br>
Example 1<br>
15 grams of urea were dissolved in 150 ml of ethanol at 70°C and<br>
under nitrogen. A 10 g composition of EPA and DHA ethyl esters -<br>
obtained by transesterification with ethanol and NaOH, followed by a<br>
complexing with urea in EtOH/EtOH 95°, according to the disclosure of<br>
EP-B-0255824- having 54.2% purity, and 51.0% assay (GC), was added<br>
under stirring and far from light. The mixture was kept under stirring for<br>
15 minutes and left to cool. After one night, the precipitate was removed<br>
by filtration and the solution was concentrated to a small volume through<br>
distillation under a 50 mm Hg pressure. The residue was treated by<br>
sodium chloride solution and n-hexane extracted. The organic phase,<br>
dried with sodium sulphate and evaporated to dryness, led to a<br>
composition of EPA and DHA ethyl esters, 85.6% purity, 77.3% assay<br>
(GC).<br>
Example 2<br>
5 grams of the composition of EPA and DHA ethyl esters, obtained as<br>
per Example 1, were dissolved in 65 ml of hexane and percolated on 6.5<br>
grams of silica gel. The obtained solution was evaporated to dryness at<br>
60°C and under a 50 mm Hg pressure, working in inert atmosphere far<br>
from light. A composition of EPA and DHA ethyl esters was obtained,<br>
85.4% assay (46.6% EPA, 38.8% DHA, GC), acidity index 
index 
Example 3<br>
5 grams of a composition of EPA and DHA ethyl esters, 76.5% assay<br>
(GC), were treated as per Example 2, through batch procedure and under<br>
slight stirring.<br>
In the end, a composition of EPA and DHA ethyl esters was obtained,<br>
82.3% assay (GC), 91.6% total assay of ω-3 ethyl esters, according to the<br>
E.P. 2000 specifications.<br>
Example 4<br>
5 grams of the composition used in Example 1, were treated as per<br>
the procedure of Example 3, finally obtaining a composition with a 53.8%<br>
assay (GC).<br><br>
