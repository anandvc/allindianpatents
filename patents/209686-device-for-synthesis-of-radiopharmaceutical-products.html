GRANTED<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br>
9-12-2004<br><br>
The present invention relates to a novel device for synthesis of radiopharmaceutical products from radioactive compounds.<br>
The present invention relates more especially to the use of this device for synthesis of radiopharmaceutical products from reagents containing radioactive elements with a short half-life, such as 11C, 13N, 150 or 18F.<br>
Prior art<br>
In diagnostic applications, such as Positron Emission Tomography (PET), use is made of radiochemical compounds, also called radiopharmaceutical compounds, which are labelled by means of an element such as 11C, 13N, 1S0 or 18F. One example of such compounds is 2- [18F] fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose, commonly called 18FDG.<br>
Synthesis of these radiopharmaceutical compounds with a short half-life is performed in apparatuses that enable the different chemical compounds for carrying out the synthesis to be brought into contact and heated during the reaction and allow the products obtained to be purified.<br>
To avoid any risk associated with the handling of radioactive substances, these apparatuses are placed in a shielded and monitored environment. These apparatuses are generally linked to an automaton which commands the various operations enabling the performance of this synthesis, comprising reaction and heating stages, which are associated with transfers of chemical reagents.<br>
Owing to the short half-life of these radioisotopes that are used, it is necessary to perform this type of synthesis at regular intervals. This multiplies the risks of contamination from one synthesis to another, while the end product is intended for injection into patients.<br><br>
Moreover, a certain number of materials contained in the components of the synthesis apparatus are particularly sensitive to radioactivity and/or to chemical corrosion. This is the case, for example, with the valves or tubes allowing transfers to take place.<br>
It is therefore necessary to wash and sterilise each component of the synthesis apparatus at regular intervals, especially all the tubing and all the valves which allow transfer of the reagents, hence the need to use components that can be sterilised easily. Users must furthermore ensure thorough, careful and regular maintenance of all the components of the apparatus.<br>
US-A-5759513 discloses an apparatus and a process for preparing radiochemical compounds in which, with the exception of the reagent labelled by means of an element with a short half-life, the reagents required are metered into containers beforehand. This gives a kit containing the said containers, the reactors, the columns and the transfer tubes fitted with valves, which are required for the process. This kit comprises a large number of elements, including valves. The overall cost does not allow it to be used as a single-use kit.<br>
WO-A-93/11871 discloses an apparatus for preparing radiochemical compounds, comprising a single-use module. This apparatus is intended to be connected to reagent containers and comprises means of metering these reagents constituted by injectors provided with pistons and actuated by stepping motors. Complex, expensive means that require handling by the operator are necessary to connect the stepping motors to the rods of the injectors.<br>
US-A-5 415 843 describes an apparatus for manufacturing radiopharmaceutical compounds which has certain characteristics  in  common  with  that  described  in  WO-A-<br><br>
93/11871. This apparatus includes a single-use disposable kit which comprises a plate and receptacles but not the connection tubes between the various receptacles.<br>
US-A-5 312 592 also describes an apparatus which has certain characteristics in common with that described in WO-A-93/11871. This document relates more especially to a disposable kit that can be used in the said apparatus and comprises a plate provided with openings and sleeves to support liquid injectors and to connect transfer tubes, as well as a hydrolysis receptacle.<br>
The article by Chaly T. et al., Appl. Radiat. Isot. Vol.41, No. 1, pp 29-34 (1990) in Int. J. "Radiat. Appl. Instrum. Part A" (Pergamon Press) describes a process for producing 18FDG by using a synthesis unit comprising disposable sterile elements such as syringes, needles, tubes, adapters and stop valves.<br>
Objects of the invention<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a device for synthesis of radioactive products, in particular radiopharmaceutical products, from radioactive elements with a short half-life, which can be used easily.<br>
In particular, it is an object of the present invention to provide a device which minimises the risks of contamination from one synthesis to another.<br>
It is likewise an object of the present invention to provide a device which is easier to maintain and service.<br>
in particular, it is an object of the present invention to provide a device which can be washed easily and sterilised easily.<br><br>

Detailed  description  of  a  preferred  embodiment  of  the invention<br>
It should be noted that the figures presented here relate to a device intended for synthesising 18FDG. These figures are given purely by way of example to illustrate the invention, but they do not in any way limit its scope. The person skilled in the art will easily be able to adapt the various elements of the device depending on the type of synthesis to be performed.<br>
As illustrated in Figure 1, the device according to the present invention comprises a fixed module 1 and a removable and disposable single-use module 2. When the device is in operation, the removable and disposable module 2 is fixed on the fixed module 1.<br>
Figure 2 provides a detailed view of the fixed module. The fixed module 1 is here in the form of a case 7, on which pistons 8a,8b,8c,8e,... are arranged.<br>
The module 1 likewise comprises an automaton controlled by a computer, although these are not shown here. The automaton controls all the operations required to implement synthesis of the radiopharmaceutical products, in particular the movement of the pistons 8a,8b,8c,8d,8e,....<br>
Moreover, to enable the device to be used, the module 1 comprises securing means which enable it to be fixed to the disposable module 2. These securing means can take the form of fasteners arranged according to a precise configuration. In the case shown in Figure 2, these fasteners are of two types.  There are,  on the one hand,  the four<br><br>
fasteners 12a,12b,12c and 12d and the central fastener 11, the said central fastener 11 here being in the form of a stud. The presence of the central fastener 11 is intended for securing the fixing of the module 2 to the module 1. It furthermore allows the pressure exerted by the pistons 8a,8b,8c,8d,8e,... to be counteracted.<br>
Figures 3 and 4 give a more detailed view of the various elements of the disposable module according to the present invention. The disposable module 2 comprises at least: one plate 5, in which a network of grooves 6 is formed according to a precise configuration;<br>
five bottles 3a,3b,3c,3d,3e containing the pre-metered chemical reagents, respectively Kryptofix, K2C03, acetonitrile, triflate, water and sodium hydroxide;<br>
-	tubes 4a,4b,4c,4d,4e,... for circulating the chemical products within the synthesis device, these tubes being flexible in the present case, and one of their ends being connected to the bottles 3a,3b,3c,3d,3e, respectively,<br>
-	columns, including outlet columns (not shown). The module 1 here comprises at least four columns, column C1 as shown in Figure 3 and columns C2, C3, C4, not shown,<br>
-	reaction compartments R1 and R2, as shown in Figure 1.<br>
The said plate 5 has a dual function. Its first function is that the plate 5 serves as a support for the tubes 4a,4b,4c,4d,4e when these tubes are fixed in the grooves 6. The configuration of these grooves 6 allows very accurate positioning of the tubes 4a,4b,4c,4d,4e relative to one another. In other words, the tubes 4a-4e, the pistons 8a-8e and the grooves 6 are capable of co-operating so as to form valves. The pistons 8a-8e associated with the portion of the tubes 4a-4e which face them thus form valves of the "pinch-valve" type, that is to say piston valves.<br><br>
It is thus important that the tubes should be positioned correctly to enable these valves to operate correctly. In particular, the pistons 8a-8e should be able to act precisely on the said tubes 4a-4e.<br>
The second function of the plate 5 is to serve as an interface between the fixed module 1 and the disposable module 2. The plate 5 is provided with securing means which enable the said disposable module 2 to be fixed on the said fixed module 1. By virtue of their shape, these securing means located on the disposable module 2 are complementary to the securing means located on the fixed module 1.<br>
According to the exemplary embodiment shown in Figures 3 and 4, these securing means on the one hand take the form of shoulders 13a,13b,13c,13d, each located at one corner of the plate 5. These shoulders 13a,13b,13c,13d are capable of fitting into the respective fasteners 12a,12b,12c,12d. On the other hand, the securing means take the form of an opening 10 which is located in the centre of the plate 5 and into which the central fastener 11 of the fixed module 1 can fit. By virtue of its central position in the plate 5, the opening 10 makes it possible to ensure that the disposable module 2 is secured in an optimum manner to the fixed module 1 while the device is being used.<br>
However, the securing means can take other forms.<br>
Figure 5 illustrates how the pistons 8a-8e located on the fixed module 1 bring about either the opening or closure of the tubes 4a-4e of the disposable module 2 as a function of the movement that they are commanded to make by the automaton. In view a, this figure shows the head 9 of one of these pistons 8a and a section of one of the flexible tubes 4a in an open position, that is to say when the tube 4a is open.  In this position,  the head 9 of the piston 8a is<br><br>
disengaged from the tube 4a and transfers of chemical products are then allowed. When commanded by the automaton, on the other hand, the head 9 of the piston 8a is displaced and comes to exert a pressure on the section of the tube 4a, as illustrated in view b, and the tube 4a is then closed, preventing any transfer of chemical products.<br>
In relation to the prior-art devices, the present invention has the original characteristic of being without any mechanical means, in particular mechanical means of opening and closing the tubes, these mechanical means being located on the fixed module 1.<br>
By virtue of this fact, the module 2 can be attached and removed easily. It can be fixed easily on the fixed module 1. Such a module 2 likewise has the advantage of being inexpensive, owing especially to the absence of mechanical means in this module, and, by virtue of this fact, allows single use.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment, the plate 5 is made of ABS and the tubes 4a,4b,4c,4d,4e, .. . are made of silicone. The advantage of such a choice in terms of the materials used is that these elements are capable of withstanding the high pressures, in particular the pressures exerted by the pistons, during the use of the device. It likewise makes it possible to limit the waste resulting from incineration of used disposable modules.<br>
Insofar as their composition allows, the various elements constituting this module can be sterilised easily, in particular by the conventional techniques such as sterilisation by gamma radiation.<br>
The example described below is an example of the use of the device according to the present invention for synthesis of 18FDG. However, this example is given only by way of illustration. Other uses are possible.<br><br>
To synthesise 18FDG with the device according to the present invention, 18F  is first of all extracted from the mixture H218O-H2O-18F. To do this, the mixture is transferred by means of gaseous helium as far as the column Ci containing an anion exchange resin, such as QMA Waters™. Column Ci allows recovery of the 18F , while H218O-H2O is transferred to the reaction compartment Rl.<br>
Tube 4e is opened to allow 0.75 ml of a solution of K2C03/K2.2.2/H20/CH3CN contained in bottle 3e to be transferred through column C1 with the aid of a vacuum pump in a reaction compartment or reactor R2. The 18F" is thus eluted, and it is transferred to reaction compartment R2.<br>
The temperature of the reactor R2 is increased to 90°C and H20 is eliminated by forming an azeotrope with acetonitrile.<br>
Tube 4d is then opened, and 0.5 ml of acetonitrile contained in bottle 3d is then transferred with the aid of a vacuum pump in reaction compartment R2.<br>
The traces of H20 are eliminated by forming an azeotrope with acetonitrile. The evaporation is continued to complete the drying.<br>
Tube 4c is opened so as to transfer with the aid of a vacuum pump a solution of 13 mg of 1,3,4,6-tetra-O-acetyl-2-0-trifluoromethane-sulphonyl-B-D-mannopyranose in 1 ml of acetonitrile contained in bottle 3c into compartment R2. The temperature of the said compartment R2 is brought to 85°C.<br>
The acetonitrile is then evaporated in vacuo while maintaining the temperature in the reactor R2 between 90 and 85°C.<br>
Tube 4b is then opened so as to transfer 1 ml of H20 contained in bottle 3b with the aid of a vacuum pump. The reactor R2 is then cooled.<br><br>
Tube 4a is then opened so as to transfer 1 ml of a solution of 0.5 N NaOH contained in bottle 3a to reactor R2 with the aid of a vacuum pump.<br>
Nitrogen at a pressure of 400 mbar is used to transfer the contents of reactor R2 through purification columns C2, C3, C4 (not shown) arranged in series at the outlet of the circuit.<br>
Tube 4b is opened for a second time to transfer 4 ml of H20 from bottle 3b to reactor R2 with the aid of a vacuum pump.<br>
Nitrogen at a pressure of 400 mbar is used a second time to transfer the contents of reactor R2 through purification columns C2, C3, C4.<br>
Finally, it will be noted that the device according to the present invention offers the advantage of being particularly compact, thus reducing the volume of the shielded chamber in which it is used and hence the quantity of lead.<br><br>
