OPTICAL ELEMENTS THAT INCLUDE CURABLE FILM-FORMING<br>
COMPOSITIONS CONTAINING BLOCKED ISOCYANATE ADHESION<br>
PROMOTERS<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0001] The present invention relates to optical elements comprising<br>
substrates coated with curable film-forming compositions containing blocked<br>
isocyanate adhesion promoters.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002] Optical elements that provide acceptable imaging qualities while<br>
maintaining durability and abrasion resistance are sought for a variety of<br>
applications, such as windshields, sunglasses, fashion lenses, nonprescription<br>
and prescription lenses, sport masks, face shields and goggles.<br>
Responsive to that need, coated optical elements have been developed.<br>
[0003] However, often the coatings lack sufficient adhesion to a substrate to<br>
provide long wear. Coatings such as photochromic coatings and protective<br>
tie-layer coatings have been developed containing adhesion promoters such<br>
as epoxides and aminoalkyltrialkoxysilanes to enhance adhesion of coatings<br>
to the substrate and/or to subsequently applied coatings. However, such<br>
adhesion promoters have highly reactive functional groups that may lead to<br>
instability and reduced shelf life of coating compositions. Blocked isocyanates<br>
have also been used, but when the deblocking temperature of the blocking<br>
agent exceeds the curing temperature of the resinous components, the<br>
adhesion promoters may not be as effective as necessary.<br>
[0004] There is a need in the art to develop optical articles containing coating<br>
compositions with adhesion promoters that will be effective at improving<br>
adhesion at or below curing temperatures, yet will not interfere with<br>
composition shelf life.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0005] In accordance with the present invention, an optical article adapted to<br>
possess a light influencing property is provided, comprising:<br>
-2-<br>
a) a substrate; and<br>
b) a curable film-forming composition applied to at least a<br>
portion of the substrate to form a coating thereon. The curable film-forming<br>
composition comprises:<br>
i) a resinous material comprising a monomer, oligomer,<br>
and/or polymer containing reactive functional groups;<br>
ii) a curing agent having two or more reactive functional<br>
groups that are reactive with functional groups in the resinous material of i);<br>
and<br>
iii) a material different from i) and ii), comprising a blocked<br>
isocyanate group and another different functional group capable of reacting<br>
with functional groups on the resinous material of i), functional groups on the<br>
curing agent of ii), functional groups on a superposed coating, and/or<br>
functional groups on the substrate. In one embodiment, the isocyanate group<br>
is blocked with a blocking agent capable of deblocking at a temperature as<br>
low as 100Â°C. Alternatively, the blocking agent is capable of deblocking at or<br>
below a temperature at which any of the functional groups on the material of<br>
iii), functional groups on the resinous material of i), functional groups on the<br>
curing agent of ii), functional groups on a superposed coating, and/or<br>
functional groups on the substrate react w/ each other. The material of iii) is<br>
present in the curable film-forming composition at least in an amount sufficient<br>
to improve adhesion between the curable film-forming composition and the<br>
substrate and/or a superposed coating compared to a substantially identical<br>
optical element that does not comprise the material of iii) in the curable filmforming<br>
composition.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0006] It is noted that, as used in this specification and the appended claims,<br>
the singular forms "a," "an," and "the" include plural referents unless expressly<br>
and unequivocally limited to one referent.<br>
[0007] For the purposes of this specification, unless otherwise indicated, all<br>
numbers expressing quantities of ingredients, reaction conditions, and other<br>
parameters used in the specification and claims are to be understood as<br>
-3-<br>
being modified in all instances by the term "about." Accordingly, unless<br>
indicated to the contrary, the numerical parameters set forth in the following<br>
specification and attached claims are approximations that may vary<br>
depending upon the desired properties to be obtained by the present<br>
invention. At the very least, and not as an attempt to limit the application of<br>
the doctrine of equivalents to the scope of the claims, each numerical<br>
parameter should at least be construed in light of the number of reported<br>
significant digits and by applying ordinary rounding techniques.<br>
[0008] All numerical ranges herein include all numerical values and ranges of<br>
all numerical values within the recited numerical ranges. Notwithstanding that<br>
the numerical ranges and parameters setting forth the broad scope of the<br>
invention are approximations, the numerical values set forth in the specific<br>
examples are reported as precisely as possible. Any numerical value,<br>
however, inherently contain certain errors necessarily resulting from the<br>
standard deviation found in their respective testing measurements.<br>
[0009] The various embodiments and examples of the present invention as<br>
presented herein are each understood to be non-limiting with respect to the<br>
scope of the invention.<br>
[0010] As used in the following description and claims, the following terms<br>
have the indicated meanings:<br>
[0011] The terms "acrylic" and "acrylate" are used interchangeably (unless to<br>
do so would alter the intended meaning) and include acrylic acids,<br>
anhydrides, and derivatives thereof, such as their Ci-Cs alkyl esters, lower<br>
alkyl-substituted acrylic acids, e.g., C-i-C5 substituted acrylic acids, such as<br>
methacrylic acid, ethacrylic acid, etc., and their CrCs alkyl esters, unless<br>
clearly indicated otherwise. The terms "(meth)acrylic" or "(meth)acrylate" are<br>
intended to cover both the acrylic/acrylate and methacrylic/methacrylate forms<br>
of the indicated material, e.g., a (meth)acrylate monomer.<br>
[0012] The term "cure", "cured" or similar terms, as used in connection with a<br>
cured or curable composition, e.g., a "cured composition" of some specific<br>
description, means that at least a portion of the polymerizable and/or<br>
crosslinkable components that form the curable composition is at least<br>
partially polymerized and/or crosslinked. In one embodiment, the degree of<br>
-4-<br>
crosslinking, can range from 5% to 100% of complete crosslinking. In<br>
alternate embodiments, the degree of crosslinking can range from 35% to<br>
85%, e.g., 50% to 85%, of full crosslinking. The degree of crosslinking can<br>
range between any combination of the previously stated values, inclusive of<br>
the recited values.<br>
[0013] The term "curable", as used for example in connection with a curable<br>
film-forming composition, means that the indicated composition is<br>
polymerizable or cross linkable, e.g., by means that include, but are not<br>
limited to, thermal, catalytic, electron beam, chemical free-radical initiation,<br>
and/or photoinitiation such as by exposure to ultraviolet light or other actinic<br>
radiation.<br>
[0014] The term "light influencing function", "light influencing property" or<br>
terms of like import means that the indicated material, e.g., coating, film,<br>
substrate, etc., is capable of modifying by absorption (or filtering) of incident<br>
light radiation, e.g., visible, ultraviolet (UV) and/or infrared (IR) radiation that<br>
impinges on the material. In alternate embodiments, the light influencing<br>
function can be light polarization, e.g., by means of a polarizer and/or dichroic<br>
dye; a change in light absorption properties, e.g., by use of a chromophore<br>
that changes color upon exposure to actinic radiation, such as a photochromic<br>
material; transmission of only a portion of the incident light radiation, e.g., by<br>
use of a fixed tint such as a conventional dye; or by a combination of one or<br>
more of such light influencing functions.<br>
[0015] The term "adapted to possess at least one light influencing property",<br>
as used for example in connection with a rigid optical substrate, means that<br>
the specified item is capable of having the light influencing property<br>
incorporated into or appended to it. For example, a plastic matrix that is<br>
adapted to possess a light influencing property means that the plastic matrix<br>
has sufficient internal free volume to accommodate internally a photochromic<br>
dye or tint. The surface of such a plastic matrix may alternatively be capable<br>
of having a photochromic or tinted layer, film or coating appended to it, and/or<br>
is capable of having a polarizing film appended to it.<br>
[0016] The terms "on", "appended to", "affixed to", "bonded to", "adhered to",<br>
or terms of like import means that the designated item, e.g., a coating, film or<br>
-5-<br>
layer, is either directly connected to (superimposed on) the object surface, or<br>
indirectly connected to the object surface, e.g., through one or more other<br>
coatings, films or layers (superposed on).<br>
[0017] The term "ophthalmic" refers to elements and devices that are<br>
associated with the eye and vision, such as but not limited to, lenses for<br>
eyewear, e.g., corrective and non-corrective lenses, and magnifying lenses.<br>
[0018] The term "optical quality", as used for example in connection with<br>
polymeric materials, e.g., a "resin of optical quality" or "organic polymeric<br>
material of optical quality" means that the indicated material, e.g., a polymeric<br>
material, resin, or resin composition, is or forms a substrate, layer, film or<br>
coating that can be used as an optical article, such as an ophthalmic lens, or<br>
in combination with an optical article.<br>
[0019] The term "rigid", as used for example in connection with an optical<br>
substrate, means that the specified item is self-supporting.<br>
[0020] The term "optical substrate" means that the specified substrate exhibits<br>
a light transmission value (transmits incident light) of at least 4 percent and<br>
exhibits a haze value of less than 1 percent, e.g., less than 0.5 percent, when<br>
measured at 550 nanometers by, for example, a Haze Card Plus Instrument.<br>
Optical substrates include, but are not limited to, optical articles such as<br>
lenses, optical layers, e.g., optical resin layers, optical films and optical<br>
coatings, and optical substrates having a light influencing property.<br>
[0021] The term "photochromic receptive" means that the indicated item has<br>
sufficient free volume to permit photochromic material(s) incorporated within it<br>
to transform from its colorless form to its colored form (and then revert to its<br>
colorless form) to the degree required for commercial optical applications.<br>
[0022] The term "tinted", as used for example in connection with ophthalmic<br>
elements and optical substrates, means that the indicated item contains a<br>
fixed light radiation absorbing agent, such as but not limited to, conventional<br>
coloring dyes, infrared and/or ultraviolet light absorbing materials on or in the<br>
indicated item. The tinted item has an absorption spectrum for visible<br>
radiation that does not vary significantly in response to actinic radiation.<br>
[0023] The term "non-tinted", as used for example in connection with<br>
ophthalmic elements and optical substrates, means that that the indicated<br>
-6-<br>
item is substantially free of fixed light radiation absorbing agents. The nontinted<br>
item has an absorption spectrum for visible radiation that does not vary<br>
significantly in response to actinic radiation.<br>
[0024] The term "actinic radiation" includes light with wavelengths of<br>
electromagnetic radiation ranging from the ultraviolet ("UV") light range,<br>
through the visible light range, and into the infrared range. Actinic radiation<br>
which can be used to cure coating compositions used in the present invention<br>
generally has wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation ranging from 150 to<br>
2,000 nanometers (nm), from 180 to 1,000 nm, or from 200 to 500 nm. In one<br>
embodiment, ultraviolet radiation having a wavelength ranging from 10 to 390<br>
nm can be used. Examples of suitable ultraviolet light sources include<br>
mercury arcs, carbon arcs, low, medium or high pressure mercury lamps,<br>
swirl-flow plasma arcs and ultraviolet light emitting diodes. Suitable ultraviolet<br>
light-emitting lamps are medium pressure mercury vapor lamps having<br>
outputs ranging from 200 to 600 watts per inch (79 to 237 watts per<br>
centimeter) across the length of the lamp tube.<br>
[0025] The term "tinted photochromic", as used for example in connection<br>
with ophthalmic elements and optical substrates, means that the indicated<br>
item contains a fixed light absorbing agent and a photochromic material. The<br>
indicated item has an absorption spectrum for visible radiation that varies in<br>
response to actinic radiation and is thermally reversible when the actinic<br>
radiation is removed. For example, the tinted photochromic item may have a<br>
first characteristic of the light absorbing agent, e.g., a coloring tint, and a<br>
second color characteristic of the combination of the light absorbing agent and<br>
the activated photochromic material when the photochromic material is<br>
exposed to actinic radiation.<br>
[0026] The term "dichroic material', "dichroic dye" or terms of like import<br>
means a material/dye that absorbs one of two orthogonal plane-polarized<br>
components of transmitted radiation more strongly than the other. Nonlimiting<br>
examples of dichroic materials include indigoids, thioindigoids,<br>
merocyanines, indans, azo and poly(azo) dyes, benzoquinones,<br>
naphthoquinones, anthraquinones, (poly)anthraquinones,<br>
-7-<br>
anthrapyrimidinones, iodine and iodates. The term "dichroic" is synonymous<br>
with "polarizing" or words of like import.<br>
[0027] The term "dichroic photochromic" means a specified material or article<br>
that exhibits both dichroic and photochromic properties. In alternate nonlimiting<br>
embodiments, the specified material can include both photochromic<br>
dyes/compounds and dichroic dyes/compounds, or single dyes/compounds<br>
that possess both photochromic and dichroic properties.<br>
[0028] The term "transparent", as used for example in connection with a<br>
substrate, film, material and/or coating, means that the indicated substrate,<br>
coating, film and/or material has the property of transmitting light without<br>
appreciable scattering so that objects lying beyond are entirely visible.<br>
[0029] The phrase "an at least partial film" means an amount of film covering<br>
at least a portion, up to the complete surface of the substrate. As used<br>
herein, a "film" may be formed by a sheeting type of material or a coating type<br>
of material. For example, a film may be an at least partially cured polymeric<br>
sheet or an at least partially cured polymeric coating of the material indicated.<br>
The phrase "at least partially cured" means a material in which from some to<br>
all of the curable or cross-linkable components are cured, crosslinked and/or<br>
reacted.<br>
[0030] The term "photochromic amount" means that a sufficient amount of<br>
photochromic material is used to produce a photochromic effect discernible to<br>
the naked eye upon activation. The particular amount used depends often<br>
upon the intensity of color desired upon irradiation thereof and upon the<br>
method used to incorporate the photochromic materials. Typically, in another<br>
non-limiting embodiment, the more photochromic incorporated, the greater is<br>
the color intensity up to a certain limit. There is a point after which the<br>
addition of any more material will not have a noticeable effect, although more<br>
material can be added, if desired.<br>
[0031] The term "superposed" describes a coating applied on top of or<br>
subsequent to the curable film-forming composition of b), such that at least a<br>
portion of the curable film-forming composition of b) lies between the<br>
substrate and the superposed coating.<br>
-8-<br>
[0032] According to the present invention, an optical element adapted to<br>
possess a light influencing property is provided, comprising:<br>
a) a substrate; and<br>
b) a curable film-forming composition applied to at least a<br>
portion of the substrate to form a coating thereon. The curable film-forming<br>
composition in turn comprises:<br>
i) a resinous material comprising a monomer, oligomer,<br>
and/or polymer containing reactive functional groups;<br>
ii) a curing agent having two or more reactive functional<br>
groups that are reactive with functional groups in the resinous material of i);<br>
and<br>
iii) a material different from i) and ii), comprising a blocked<br>
isocyanate group and another different functional group capable of reacting<br>
with functional groups on the resinous material of i), functional groups on the<br>
curing agent of ii), functional groups on a superposed coating, and/or<br>
functional groups on the substrate. The isocyanate group is blocked with a<br>
blocking agent. In one embodiment, the blocking agent is capable of<br>
deblocking at a temperature as low as 100Â°C. In a separate embodiment,<br>
often when the curable film-forming composition is thermally curable, the<br>
blocking agent is capable of deblocking at or below a temperature at which<br>
any of the functional groups on the material of iii), functional groups on the<br>
resinous material of i), functional groups on the curing agent of ii), functional<br>
groups on a superposed coating, and/or functional groups on the substrate<br>
react w/ each other. Additionally, the material of iii) is present in the curable<br>
film-forming composition at least in an amount sufficient to improve adhesion<br>
between the curable film-forming composition and the substrate and/or a<br>
superposed coating compared to a substantially identical optical element that<br>
does not contain the material of iii) in the curable film-forming composition.<br>
[0033] Optical elements of the present invention include ophthalmic articles<br>
such as piano (without optical power) and vision correcting (prescription)<br>
lenses (finished and semi-finished) including multifocal lenses (bifocal, trifocal,<br>
and progressive lenses); and ocular devices such as contact lenses and<br>
intraocular lenses, sun lenses, fashion lenses, sport masks, face shields and<br>
-9-<br>
goggles. The optical element may also be chosen from glazings such as<br>
windows and vehicular transparencies such as automobile windshields and<br>
side windows.<br>
[0034] The optical elements of the present invention are adapted to possess a<br>
light influencing property. Such properties may be of more than one type and<br>
may be imparted to any of the components of the optical element, including<br>
the substrate, the curable film-forming composition, and/or any superposed<br>
coatings.<br>
[0035] The substrate a) used in the present invention comprises an optical<br>
substrate and may be chosen from, inter alia, mineral glass, ceramic, solgel,<br>
and polymeric organic materials. The substrate may be rigid, i. e., capable of<br>
maintaining its shape and supporting the applied curable film-forming<br>
composition. The optical substrate, including any coatings or treatments<br>
applied thereto, may be adapted to possess a light influencing property as<br>
discussed above. The light influencing property may be of more than one<br>
type and may be integral to (i. e., incorporated into) the substrate, for<br>
example, by imbibition or casting of a light influencing compound into the<br>
substrate matrix, or a light influencing compound may be contained in a<br>
coating or treatment applied to a surface of the substrate. In a particular<br>
embodiment of the present invention the substrate is a polymeric organic<br>
material such as an optically clear polymerizate, e.g., material suitable for<br>
optical applications, such as ophthalmic articles. Such optically clear<br>
polymerizates have a refractive index that may vary widely. Examples include<br>
polymerizates of optical resins such as thermoplastic polycarbonate and<br>
optical resins sold by PPG Industries, Inc. as TRIVEXÂ® monomer composition<br>
and under the CR- designation, e.g., CR-39Â® monomer composition. High<br>
refractive index polythiourethane substrates available from Mitsui Chemicals<br>
Co., Ltd., under the names MR-6, MR-7, MR-8, and MR-10 are also suitable.<br>
Non-limiting examples of other suitable substrates are disclosed in U.S.<br>
Patent Publication 2004/0096666 in paragraphs [0061] and [0064] to [0081],<br>
incorporated herein by reference.<br>
[0036] The substrate used in the optical article of the present invention may<br>
comprise polymeric organic material chosen from thermoplastic material,<br>
-10-<br>
thermosetting material and mixtures thereof. Such materials are described in<br>
the Kirk-Othmer Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology. Fourth Edition,<br>
Volume 6, pages 669 to 760. Thermoplastic materials can be made<br>
substantially thermoplastic or thermosetting by the appropriate chemical<br>
modification, as known to those skilled in the art.<br>
[0037] Further examples of optical resins that may be used as substrates in<br>
the present invention include the resins used to form hard and soft contact<br>
lenses such as are disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 5,166,345, column 11, line<br>
52, to column 12, line 52, soft contact lenses with high moisture content as<br>
described in U.S. Patent No. 5,965,630 and extended wear contact lenses as<br>
described in U.S. Patent No. 5,965,631, which disclosures related to optical<br>
resins for contact lenses are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
[0038] In certain embodiments, the substrate may include a coating or film on<br>
the surface thereof, wherein the coating or film imparts a light influencing<br>
property and/or provides protection to the substrate from abrasion or other<br>
damage. Examples of suitable abrasion resistant coatings include those<br>
disclosed in published U. S. Patent Application No. 2004/0207809,<br>
paragraphs [0205]-[0249], incorporated herein by reference. Suitable<br>
coatings designed to provide impact resistance include those disclosed in U.<br>
S. Patent No. 5,316,791, col. 3, line 7-col. 7, line 35, incorporated herein by<br>
reference. Other suitable coatings and films are discussed in more detail<br>
below.<br>
[0039] The curable film-forming composition of b) may be cured using any<br>
known means, such as thermally or by actinic radiation. The film-forming<br>
composition comprises:<br>
i) a resinous material comprising a monomer, oligomer,<br>
and/or polymer containing reactive functional groups;<br>
ii) a curing agent having two or more reactive functional<br>
groups that are reactive with functional groups in the resinous material of i);<br>
and<br>

wherein at least one monomer contains reactive functional groups. Suitable<br>
monomers include ethylenically unsaturated monomers, for example, vinyl<br>
monomers and/or (meth)acrylic monomers; i. e., monomers of acrylic or<br>

[0042] Beta-hydroxy ester functional monomers can be prepared from<br>
ethylenically unsaturated, epoxy functional monomers and carboxylic acids<br>
having from about 13 to about 20 carbon atoms, or from ethylenically<br>
unsaturated acid functional monomers and epoxy compounds containing at<br>

ethylenically unsaturated acid functional monomer and epoxy compound are<br>
typically reacted in a 1:1 equivalent ratio. The epoxy compound does not<br>
contain ethylenic unsaturation that would participate in free radical-initiated<br>
polymerization with the unsaturated acid functional monomer. Useful epoxy<br>

disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 5,098,947, which is incorporated herein by<br>
reference.<br>
[0047] Amide functional monomers are suitable for use as the resinous<br>
material i). Likewise, other functional groups may be incorporated as desired<br>
using suitably functional monomers if available or conversion reactions as<br>
necessary.<br>
[0048] Actinic radiation-curable compositions generally contain at least one<br>
free radical photoinitiator. When the composition includes cationic initiated<br>
epoxy monomer(s), the formulation will also contain at least one cationic<br>
photoinitiator. The photoinitiator will be present in amounts sufficient to<br>
initiate and sustain the curing of the composition, i.e., an initiating amount.<br>
Photoinitiators are typically used in the least amount necessary to obtain<br>
initiation of the curing process. Generally, the photoinitiator(s) is present in<br>
amounts of from 0.1 to 10 weight percent. In alternate embodiments, the<br>
photoinitiator is present in amounts of from 0.5 to 6 weight percent, e.g., from<br>
1 to 4 weight percent, based on the total weight of the photoinitiated<br>
polymerizable components in the curable composition. Free radical<br>
photoinitiators are well known to those skilled in the art. Examples of<br>
commercial photoinitiators can be found in column 10, lines 38-43 of U.S.<br>
Patent 5,910,375, which disclosure is hereby incorporated herein by<br>
reference.<br>
[0049] Cationic photoinitiators can be used in conjunction with the free-radical<br>
photoinitiators. Generally, cationic initiators are used with abstraction type<br>
photoinitiators, hydrogen donor materials such as butyryl choline<br>
triphenylbutyl borate or combinations of such materials. Typical cationic<br>
photoinitiators are onium salts, which are described in U.S. Patent 5,639,802,<br>
column 8, line 59 to column 10, line 46, which disclosure is hereby<br>
incorporated herein by reference. Non-limiting examples of such initiators<br>
include 4,4'-dimethyldiphenyliodonium tetrafluoroborate, phenyl-4-<br>
octyloxyphenyl phenyliodonium hexafluoroantimonate, dodecyldiphenyl<br>

iodonium hexafluoroantimonate, triaryl sulfonium hexafluoroantimonate salts<br>
and triaryl sulfonium hexafluorophosphate salts, e.g., triphenylsulfonium salt<br>
of phosphorous hexafluoride. Mixtures of cationic initiators can also be used.<br>
[0050] The resinous material of i) may also comprise oligomers and/or<br>
polymers, selected from acrylic polymers, polyesters, polyurethanes,<br>
polycarbonates, and polyethers. Generally these oligomers and polymers can<br>
be any of these types made by any method known to those skilled in the art.<br>
The functional groups on the resinous material may be selected from, inter<br>
alia, carboxylic acid groups, amine groups, epoxide groups, hydroxyl groups,<br>
thiol groups, carbamate groups, amide groups, urea groups, acrylate groups<br>
and mercaptan groups.<br>
[0051] Suitable acrylic polymers include copolymers of acrylic acid or<br>
methacrylic acid, and/or one or more alkyl esters of acrylic acid or methacrylic<br>
acid, optionally together with one or more other polymerizable ethylenically<br>
unsaturated monomers. Useful alkyl esters of acrylic acid or methacrylic acid<br>
include aliphatic alkyl esters containing from 1 to 30, and often 4 to 18 carbon<br>
atoms in the alkyl group. Non-limiting examples include methyl methacrylate,<br>
ethyl methacrylate, butyl methacrylate, ethyl acrylate, butyl acrylate, and 2-<br>
ethyl hexyl acrylate. Suitable other copolymerizable ethylenically unsaturated<br>
monomers include vinyl aromatic compounds such as styrene and vinyl<br>
toluene; nitriles such as acrylonitrile and methacrylonitrile; vinyl and vinylidene<br>
halides such as vinyl chloride and vinylidene fluoride and vinyl esters such as<br>
vinyl acetate.<br>
[0052] The acrylic copolymer can include hydroxyl functional groups, which<br>
are often incorporated into the polymer by including one or more hydroxyl<br>
functional monomers in the reactants used to produce the copolymer. Useful<br>
hydroxyl functional monomers include those mentioned above. The acrylic<br>
polymer can also be prepared with N-(alkoxymethyl)acrylamides and N-<br>
(alkoxymethyl)methacrylamides.<br>
[0053] Carbamate functional groups can be included in the acrylic polymer by<br>
copolymerizing the acrylic monomers with a carbamate functional vinyl<br>
monomer, such as a carbamate functional alkyl ester of methacrylic acid.<br>
Alternatively, carbamate functionality may be introduced into the acrylic<br>
-15-<br>
polymer by reacting a hydroxyl functional acrylic polymer with a low molecular<br>
weight carbamate functional material, such as can be derived from an alcohol<br>
or glycol ether, via a transcarbamoylation reaction. In this reaction, a low<br>
molecular weight carbamate functional material derived from an alcohol or<br>
glycol ether is reacted with the hydroxyl groups of the acrylic polyol, yielding a<br>
carbamate functional acrylic polymer and the original alcohol or glycol ether.<br>
The low molecular weight carbamate functional material derived from an<br>
alcohol or glycol ether may be prepared by reacting the alcohol or glycol ether<br>
with urea in the presence of a catalyst. Suitable alcohols include lower<br>
molecular weight aliphatic, cycloaliphatic, and aromatic alcohols such as<br>
methanol, ethanol, propanol, butanol, cyclohexanol, 2-ethylhexanol, and 3-<br>
methylbutanol. Suitable glycol ethers include ethylene glycol methyl ether<br>
and propylene glycol methyl ether. Propylene glycol methyl ether and<br>
methanol are most often used. Other carbamate functional monomers as<br>
known to those skilled in the art may also be used.<br>
[0054] Amide functionality may be introduced to the acrylic polymer by using<br>
suitably functional monomers in the preparation of the polymer, or by<br>
converting other functional groups to amido- groups using techniques known<br>
to those skilled in the art. Likewise, other functional groups may be<br>
incorporated as desired using suitably functional monomers if available or<br>
conversion reactions as necessary.<br>
[0055] Acrylic polymers can be prepared via aqueous emulsion<br>
polymerization techniques and used directly in the preparation of aqueous<br>
coating compositions, or can be prepared via organic solution polymerization<br>
techniques for solventborne compositions. When prepared via organic<br>
solution polymerization with groups capable of salt formation such as acid or<br>
amine groups, upon neutralization of these groups with a base or acid the<br>
polymers can be dispersed into aqueous medium. Generally any method of<br>
producing such polymers that is known to those skilled in the art utilizing art<br>
recognized amounts of monomers can be used.<br>
[0056] Besides acrylic polymers, the resinous material of i) may be an alkyd<br>
resin or a polyester oligomer and/or polymer. Such materials may be<br>
prepared in a known manner by condensation of polyhydric alcohols and<br>
-16-<br>
polycarboxylic acids. Suitable polyhydric alcohols include, but are not limited<br>
to, ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, butylene glycol, 1,6-hexylene glycol,<br>
neopentyl glycol, diethylene glycol, glycerol, trimethylol propane, and<br>
pentaerythritol. Suitable polycarboxylic acids include, but are not limited to,<br>
succinic acid, adipic acid, azelaic acid, sebacic acid, maleic acid, fumaric acid,<br>
phthalic acid, tetrahydrophthalic acid, hexahydrophthalic acid, and trimellitic<br>
acid. Besides the polycarboxylic acids mentioned above, functional<br>
equivalents of the acids such as anhydrides where they exist or lower alkyl<br>
esters of the acids such as the methyl esters may be used. Where it is<br>
desired to produce air-drying alkyd resins, suitable drying oil fatty acids may<br>
be used and include, for example, those derived from linseed oil, soya bean<br>
oil, tall oil, dehydrated castor oil, or tung oil.<br>
[0057] Unsaturated polyester resins are well known to those skilled in the art<br>
and can be prepared by the reaction of one or more polyols with one or more<br>
polycarboxylic acids (saturated and unsaturated), with olefinic unsaturation<br>
being provided by one or more of the reactants, usually the polycarboxylic<br>
acid. The polyester resin will generally have a number average molecular<br>
weight of from 1000 to 5000.<br>
[0058] Non-limiting examples of unsaturated polycarboxylic acids, e.g.,<br>
dicarboxylic acids, include but are not limited to, maleic, fumaric, citraconic,<br>
itaconic and meconic acids, their anhydrides and their lower alkyl esters or<br>
acid halides. Non-limiting examples of saturated polycarboxylic acids include<br>
aliphatic dicarboxylic acids such as malonic, succinic, glutaric, adipic, suberic,<br>
azelaic, pimelic and sebacic acids; aromatic acids such as orthophthalic,<br>
terephthalic, isophthalic acids and the anhydrides of such aromatic acids,<br>
such as phthalic anhydride and maleic anhydride, and the lower alkyl esters<br>
or acid halides of these acids or mixtures thereof.<br>
[0059] Non-limiting examples of polyols include ethylene glycol, propylene<br>
glycol, butylene glycols, neopentyl glycol, dipropylene glycol and the<br>
poly(ethylene glycol)s, such as diethylene glycol, triethylene glycol,<br>
tetraethylene glycol and mixtures thereof.<br>
[0060] The polyester resin may also contain other copolymerizable monomers<br>
such as allylic esters, acrylate monomers and mixtures thereof. Non-limiting<br>
-17-<br>
examples of allylic esters include diallyl phthalate, diethylene glycol bis(allyl<br>
carbonate), triallyl cyanurate, allyl acrylate and diallyl maleate. Non-limiting<br>
examples of acrylate monomers include monoacrylates, diacrylates,<br>
triacrylates, tetraacrylates, pentaacrylates and higher polyfunctional acrylates,<br>
which include methyl methacrylate, ethylene glycol diacrylate, ethylene glycol<br>
dimethacrylate, polyethylene glycol diacrylate, polyethylene glycol<br>
dimethacrylate, 1,6-hexanedioldiacrylate, ethoxylated bisphenol A diacrylate,<br>
ethoxylated bisphenol A dimethacrylate, trimethylolpropane polyoxyethylene<br>
triacrylate, dipentaerythritol pentaacrylate and bis(4-<br>
methacrylolylthiophenyl)sulfide.<br>
[0061] The allylic ester may represent from 1 to 20 weight percent of the<br>
polyester resin composition. The acrylate monomer may represent from 1 to<br>
50 weight percent of the polyester composition. The polyester composition<br>
can be cured by incorporating conventional photoinitiators in the composition,<br>
followed by irradiating the composition with radiation, e.g., ultraviolet light.<br>
Non-limiting examples of polyester compositions can be found in Tables 2, 3,<br>
5, 7 and 8 of U.S. Patent 6,863,848, which compositions are incorporated<br>
herein by reference. Further details of these compositions and their curing<br>
can be found in column 16, line 11 through column 21, line 48 of U.S. Patent<br>
6,863,848 B2, which disclosure is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
[0062] Another non-limiting example of a suitable resinous material of i) is a<br>
composition comprising an unsaturated polyester resin, an ethylenically<br>
unsaturated ester monomer, an optional vinyl monomer and a free radical<br>
polymerization catalyst. Such compositions are described in column 6, line 61<br>
to column 10, line 54 of U.S. Patent 5,319,007, which disclosure is<br>
incorporated by reference. The unsaturated polyester resin is derived from<br>
the interaction of saturated or unsaturated dicarboxylic acids with polyhydric<br>
alcohols.<br>
[0063] The base polyester resin generally has a molecular weight of from<br>
1500 to 5200 with an average molecular weight of 2470 and a Brookfield<br>
viscosity at 25 Â°C of 440 centipoises. In addition to the base polyester, a<br>
flexible polyester can be included optionally.<br>
-18-<br>
[0064] The ethylenically unsaturated ester can be an aromatic ester<br>
represented by the following general formula:<br>
CH2=C(A)-C(0)-0-[( CH2)m-0]n-Ar(R)<br>
wherein A comprises a Cns alkyl, Ar comprises a phenylene molecule, R<br>
comprises a C-I-B alkyl, m comprises an integer of 1 to 6, and n comprises an<br>
integer of 1 to 12, or the unsaturated ester can be an ester of an acrylic or<br>
methacrylic acid. Non-limiting examples of such ethylenically unsaturated<br>
esters include methyl acrylate, methyl methacrylate, phenoxyethyl acrylate,<br>
phenoxyethyl methacrylate, methoxyethyl methacrylate, methoxyethyl<br>
acrylate, ethoxyethyl methacrylate, and ethoxyethyl acrylate.<br>
[0065] Carbamate functional groups may be incorporated into the polyester<br>
by first forming a hydroxyalkyl carbamate which can be reacted with the<br>
polyacids and polyols used in forming the polyester. The hydroxyalkyl<br>
carbamate is condensed with acid functionality on the polyester, yielding<br>
terminal carbamate functionality. Carbamate functional groups may also be<br>
incorporated into the polyester by reacting terminal hydroxyl groups on the<br>
polyester with a low molecular weight carbamate functional material via a<br>
transcarbamoylation process similar to the one described above in connection<br>
with the incorporation of carbamate groups into the acrylic polymers, or by<br>
reacting isocyanic acid with a hydroxyl functional polyester.<br>
[0066] Other functional groups such as ethylenic unsaturation, amine, amide,<br>
thiol, and urea may be incorporated into the polyester or alkyd resin as<br>
desired using suitably functional reactants if available, or conversion reactions<br>
as necessary to yield the desired functional groups. Such techniques are<br>
known to those skilled in the art.<br>
[0067] Polyurethanes can also be used as the resinous material of i). Among<br>
the polyurethanes which can be used are polyurethane polyols which<br>
generally are prepared by reacting the polyester polyols or acrylic polyols<br>
such as those mentioned above with a polyisocyanate such that the OH/NCO<br>
equivalent ratio is greater than 1:1 so that free hydroxyl groups are present in<br>
the product. The organic polyisocyanate which is used to prepare the<br>
polyurethane polyol can be an aliphatic polyisocyanate, which is typically<br>
-19-<br>
used, or an aromatic polyisocyanate or a mixture of the two. Diisocyanates<br>
are typically used, although higher polyisocyanates can be used in place of or<br>
in combination with diisocyanates. Examples of suitable aromatic<br>
diisocyanates are 4,4'-diphenylmethane diisocyanate and toluene<br>
diisocyanate. Examples of suitable aliphatic diisocyanates are straight chain<br>
aliphatic diisocyanates such as 1,6-hexamethylene diisocyanate. Also,<br>
cycloaliphatic diisocyanates can be employed. Examples include isophorone<br>
diisocyanate and 4,4'-methylene-bis-(cyclohexyl isocyanate). Examples of<br>
suitable higher polyisocyanates are 1,2,4-benzene triisocyanate and<br>
polymethylene polyphenyl isocyanate. As with the polyesters, the<br>
polyurethanes can be prepared with unreacted carboxylic acid groups, which<br>
upon neutralization with bases such as amines allows for dispersion into<br>
aqueous medium.<br>
[0068] Terminal and/or pendent carbamate functional groups can be<br>
incorporated into the polyurethane by reacting a polyisocyanate with a polyol<br>
containing the terminal/pendent carbamate groups. Alternatively, carbamate<br>
functional groups can be incorporated into the polyurethane by reacting a<br>
polyisocyanate with a polyol and a hydroxyalkyl carbamate or isocyanic acid<br>
as separate reactants. Carbamate functional groups can also be incorporated<br>
into the polyurethane by reacting a hydroxyl functional polyurethane with a<br>
low molecular weight carbamate functional material via a transcarbamoylation<br>
process similar to the one described above in connection with the<br>
incorporation of carbamate groups into the acrylic polymer. Additionally, an<br>
isocyanate functional polyurethane can be reacted with a hydroxyalkyl<br>
carbamate to yield a carbamate functional polyurethane.<br>
[0069] Other functional groups such as ethylenic unsaturation, amide, thiol,<br>
and urea may be incorporated into the polyurethane as desired using suitably<br>
functional reactants if available, or conversion reactions as necessary to yield<br>
the desired functional groups. Such techniques are known to those skilled in<br>
the art.<br>
[0070] Suitable polycarbonates may be prepared by reacting phosgene or<br>
carbonate diesters with one or more polyols including any of those disclosed<br>
-20-<br>
above in the preparation of the polyester, as known to those skilled in the art.<br>
Bisphenol A is used as the polyol in one embodiment of the present invention.<br>
[0071] Hydroxyl functionality is often terminal to polycarbonates. The<br>
hydroxyl functional groups may be converted to other functional groups as<br>
desired.<br>
[0072] Examples of polyether polyols are polyalkylene ether polyols which<br>
include those having the following structural formula:<br>
O OH<br>
R<br>
m<br>
or<br>
where the substituent RI is hydrogen or lower alkyl containing from 1 to 5<br>
carbon atoms including mixed substituents, and n is typically from 2 to 6 and<br>
m is from 8 to 100 or higher. Included are poly(oxytetramethylene) glycols,<br>
poly(oxytetraethylene) glycols, poly(oxy-1,2-propylene) glycols, and poly(oxy-<br>
1,2-butylene) glycols.<br>
[0073] Also useful are polyether polyols formed from oxyalkylation of various<br>
polyols, for example, diols such as ethylene glycol, 1,6-hexanediol, Bisphenol<br>
A and the like, or other higher polyols such as trimethylolpropane,<br>
pentaerythritol, and the like. Polyols of higher functionality which can be<br>
utilized as indicated can be made, for instance, by oxyalkylation of<br>
compounds such as sucrose or sorbitol. One commonly utilized oxyalkylation<br>
method is reaction of a polyol with an alkylene oxide, for example, propylene<br>
or ethylene oxide, in the presence of an acidic or basic catalyst. Particular<br>
polyethers include those sold under the names TERATHANE and TERACOL,<br>
available from E. I. Du Pont de Nemours and Company, Inc., and POLYMEG,<br>
-21-<br>
available from Q 0 Chemicals, Inc., a subsidiary of Great Lakes Chemical<br>
Corp.<br>
[0074J Pendant carbamate functional groups may be incorporated into the<br>
polyethers by a transcarbamoylation reaction. Other functional groups such as<br>
acid, amine, epoxide, amide, thiol, and urea may be incorporated into the<br>
polyether as desired using suitably functional reactants if available, or<br>
conversion reactions as necessary to yield the desired functional groups.<br>
[0075] Appropriate mixtures of resinous materials may also be used in the<br>
invention. The amount of the resinous material in the curable film-forming<br>
composition generally ranges from 5 to 75 percent by weight based on the<br>
total weight of the curable film-forming composition.<br>
[0076] The curable film-forming composition of b) used to prepare the optical<br>
element of the present invention further comprises ii) a curing (crosslinking)<br>
agent having reactive functional groups that are reactive with functional<br>
groups in the resinous material of i). The curing agent may comprise, for<br>
example, an aminoplast resin, a polyisocyanate, a blocked polyisocyanate, a<br>
polyepoxide, a polyacid, an anhydride, a polyanhydride, a polyamine, a<br>
polyethylenically unsaturated material such as a polyvinyl ether or<br>
poly(meth)acrylate, and/or a polyol.<br>
[0077] Useful aminoplasts can be obtained from the condensation reaction of<br>
formaldehyde with an amine or amide. Nonlimiting examples of amines or<br>
amides include melamine, urea and benzoguanamine.<br>
[0078] Although condensation products obtained from the reaction of alcohols<br>
and formaldehyde with melamine, urea or benzoguanamine are most<br>
common, condensates with other amines or amides can be used. For<br>
example, aldehyde condensates of glycoluril, which yield a high melting<br>
crystalline product useful in powder coatings, can be used. Formaldehyde is<br>
the most commonly used aldehyde, but other aldehydes such as<br>
acetaldehyde, crotonaldehyde, and benzaldehyde can also be used.<br>
[0079] The aminoplast can contain imino and methylol groups. In certain<br>
instances, at least a portion of the methylol groups can be etherified with an<br>
alcohol to modify the cure response. Any monohydric alcohol like methanol,<br>
ethanol, n-butyl alcohol, isobutanol, and hexanol can be employed for this<br>
-22-<br>
purpose. Nonlimiting examples of suitable aminoplast resins are<br>
commercially available from Cytec Industries, Inc. under the trademark<br>
CYMELÂ® and from Solutia, Inc. under the trademark RESIMENEÂ®.<br>
Particularly useful aminoplasts include CYMELÂ® 385 (suitable for waterbased<br>
compositions), CYMELÂ® 1158 imino-functional melamine<br>
formaldehyde condensates, and CYMELÂ® 303. Another useful crosslinking<br>
agent from Cytec Industries, Inc. that reacts in a manner similar to an<br>
aminoplast resin is Tris(alkoxycarbonylamino) Triazine sold under the<br>
tradename CylinkÂ® 2000.<br>
[0080] Other crosslinking agents suitable for use include polyisocyanate<br>
crosslinking agents. As used herein, the term "polyisocyanate" is intended to<br>
include blocked (or capped) polyisocyanates as well as unblocked<br>
polyisocyanates. The polyisocyanate can be aliphatic, aromatic, or a mixture<br>
thereof. Although higher polyisocyanates such as isocyanurates of<br>
diisocyanates are often used, diisocyanates can also be used. Isocyanate<br>
prepolymers, for example reaction products of polyisocyanates with polyols<br>
also can be used. Mixtures of polyisocyanate crosslinking agents can be<br>
used.<br>
[0081] The polyisocyanate which is utilized as a crosslinking agent can be<br>
prepared from a variety of isocyanate-containing materials. Examples of<br>
suitable polyisocyanates include trimers prepared from the following<br>
diisocyanates: toluene diisocyanate, 4,4'-methylene-bis(cyclohexyl<br>
isocyanate), isophorone diisocyanate, an isomeric mixture of 2,2,4- and<br>
2,4,4-trimethyl hexamethylene diisocyanate, 1,6-hexamethylene diisocyanate,<br>
tetramethyl xylylene diisocyanate and 4,4'-diphenylmethylene diisocyanate.<br>
In addition, blocked polyisocyanate prepolymers of various polyols such as<br>
polyester polyols can also be used.<br>
[0082] Isocyanate groups may be blocked or unblocked as desired. If the<br>
polyisocyanate is to be blocked or capped, any suitable aliphatic,<br>
cycloaliphatic, or aromatic alkyl monoalcohol or phenolic compound known to<br>
those skilled in the art can be used as a capping agent for the polyisocyanate.<br>
Examples of suitable blocking agents include those materials which would<br>
unblock at elevated temperatures such as lower aliphatic alcohols including<br>
-23-<br>
methanol, ethanol, and n-butanol; cycloaliphatic alcohols such as<br>
cyclohexanol; aromatic-alkyi alcohols such as phenyl carbinol and<br>
methylphenyl carbinol; and phenolic compounds such as phenol itself and<br>
substituted phenols wherein the substituents do not affect coating operations,<br>
such as cresol and nitrophenol. Glycol ethers may also be used as capping<br>
agents. Suitable glycol ethers include ethylene glycol butyl ether, diethylene<br>
glycol butyl ether, ethylene glycol methyl ether and propylene glycol methyl<br>
ether. Other suitable capping agents include oximes such as methyl ethyl<br>
ketoxime, acetone oxime and cyclohexanone oxime, lactams such as epsiloncaprolactam,<br>
pyrazoles such as dimethyl pyrazole, and amines such as<br>
diisopropylamine.<br>
[0083] Polyepoxides are suitable curing agents for polymers having carboxylic<br>
acid groups and/or amine groups. Examples of suitable polyepoxides include<br>
low molecular weight polyepoxides such as 3,4-epoxycyclohexylmethyl 3,4-<br>
epoxycyclohexanecarboxylate and bis(3,4-epoxy-6-methylcyclohexyl-methyl)<br>
adipate. Higher molecular weight polyepoxides, including polyglycidyl ethers<br>
of polyhydric phenols and alcohols, are also suitable as crosslinking agents.<br>
[0084] Polyacids, particularly polycarboxylic acids, are good curing agents for<br>
polymers having epoxy functional groups. Examples of suitable<br>
polycarboxylic acids include adipic, succinic, sebacic, azelaic, and<br>
dodecanedioic acid. Other suitable polyacid crosslinking agents include acid<br>
group-containing acrylic polymers prepared from an ethylenically unsaturated<br>
monomer containing at least one carboxylic acid group and at least one<br>
ethylenically unsaturated monomer that is free from carboxylic acid groups.<br>
Such acid functional acrylic polymers can have an acid number ranging from<br>
30 to 150. Acid functional group-containing polyesters can be used as well.<br>
Low molecular weight polyesters and half-acid esters can be used which are<br>
based on the condensation of aliphatic polyols with aliphatic and/or aromatic<br>
polycarboxylic acids or anhydrides. Examples of suitable aliphatic polyols<br>
include ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, butylene glycol, 1,6-hexanediol,<br>
trimethylol propane, di-trimethylol propane, neopentyl glycol, 1,4-<br>
cyclohexanedimethanol, pentaerythritol, and the like. The polycarboxylic<br>
acids and anhydrides may include, inter alia, terephthalic acid, isophthalic<br>
-24-<br>
acid, phthalic acid, phthalic anhydride, tetrahydrophthalic acid,<br>
tetrahydrophthalic anhydride, hexahydrophthalic anhydride,<br>
methylhexahydrophthalic anhydride, chlorendic anhydride, and the like.<br>
Mixtures of acids and/or anhydrides may also be used. The above-described<br>
polyacid crosslinking agents are described in further detail in U.S. Patent No.<br>
4,681,811 at column 6, line 45 to column 9, line 54, which is incorporated<br>
herein by reference.<br>
[0085] Polyethylenically unsaturated curing agents; i. e., materials having<br>
multiple ethylenically unsaturated groups, are particularly useful in filmforming<br>
compositions that cure using actinic radiation; e. g., UV curable<br>
compositions. Polyvinyl ethers, such as those available from Morflex, Inc.,<br>
under the name Vectomer, are examples of suitable curing agents.<br>
Poly(meth)acrylate curing agents include ethylene glycol di(meth)acrylate,<br>
tetraethylene glycol di(meth)acrylate, glycerol di(meth)acrylate, glycerol<br>
tri(meth)acrylate, 1,3-propylene glycol di(meth)acrylate, dipropylene glycol<br>
di(meth)acrylate, 1,4-butanediol di(meth)acrylate, 1,2,4-butanetriol<br>
tri(meth)acrylate, 1,6-hexanediol di(meth)acrylate, 1,4-cyclohexanediol<br>
di(meth)acrylate, 1,4-benzenediol di(meth)acrylate, pentaerythritol<br>
tetra(meth)acrylate, 1,5-pentanediol di(meth)acrylate, trimethylolpropane<br>
di(meth)acrylate and trimethylolpropane tri(meth)acrylate.<br>
[0086] Nonlimiting examples of suitable polyamine crosslinking agents include<br>
primary or secondary diamines or polyamines in which the radicals attached<br>
to the nitrogen atoms can be saturated or unsaturated, aliphatic, alicyclic,<br>
aromatic, aromatic-substituted-aliphatic, aliphatic-substituted-aromatic, and<br>
heterocyclic. Nonlimiting examples of suitable aliphatic and alicyclic diamines<br>
include 1,2-ethylene diamine, 1,2-propylene diamine, 1,8-octane diamine,<br>
isophorone diamine, propane-2,2-cyclohexyl amine, and the like. Nonlimiting<br>
examples of suitable aromatic diamines include phenylene diamines and<br>
toluene diamines, for example o-phenylene diamine and p-tolylene diamine.<br>
Polynuclear aromatic diamines such as 4,4'-biphenyl diamine, methylene<br>
dianiline and monochloromethylene dianiline are also suitable.<br>
[0087] Suitable polyol crosslinking agents include any polyols mentioned<br>
above.<br>
-25-<br>
[0088] Appropriate mixtures of curing agents may also be used in the<br>
invention. The amount of the curing agent in the curable film-forming<br>
composition generally ranges from 5 to 75 percent by weight based on the<br>
total weight of the curable film-forming composition.<br>
[0089] The curable film-forming composition of b) further comprises iii) a<br>
material different from i) and ii), comprising a blocked isocyanate group and<br>
another different functional group capable of reacting with functional groups<br>
on the resinous material of i), functional groups on the curing agent of ii),<br>
functional groups on a superposed coating, and/or functional groups on the<br>
substrate. In one embodiment of the present invention, the isocyanate group<br>
is blocked with a blocking agent capable of deblocking at a temperature as<br>
low as 100Â°C, particularly useful when the film-forming composition is curable<br>
by actinic radiation. In a separate embodiment, such as when the film-forming<br>
composition is thermally curable, the blocking agent may be capable of<br>
deblocking at or below a temperature at which any of the functional groups, i.<br>
e., functional groups on the material of iii), functional groups on the resinous<br>
material of i), functional groups on the curing agent of ii), functional groups on<br>
a superposed coating, and/or functional groups on the substrate, react w/<br>
each other. Though not intending to be bound by theory, it is intended in any<br>
embodiment that free isocyanate groups on the material of iii) may be<br>
available to react with groups on the resinous material of i), groups on the<br>
curing agent of ii), groups on a superposed coating, and/or groups on the<br>
substrate, regardless of the method of cure. Such free isocyanate groups on<br>
the material of iii) may be available to react during the curing reaction of the<br>
resinous material of i) and the curing agent of ii) by deblocking at or below the<br>
curing temperature of the resinous material of i) and the curing agent of ii),<br>
while not adversely affecting the storage stability of the curable film-forming<br>
composition.<br>
[0090] The blocking agent used in the material of iii) may be any blocking<br>
agent known to be capable of deblocking at a temperature as low as 100Â°C,<br>
or capable of deblocking at or below a temperature at which any of the<br>
functional groups in the film-forming composition react w/ each other. Such<br>
deblocking may be enabled or enhanced by the use of known catalysts. The<br>
-26-<br>
catalyst may comprise Lewis bases, Lewis acids and/or insertion catalysts<br>
described in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, 5th Edition,<br>
1992, Volume A21, pp. 673 to 674, which description is herein incorporated<br>
by reference. For example, the catalyst may comprise tin octylate, dibutyltin<br>
diacetate, dibutyltin dilaurate, dibutyltin mercaptide, dibutyltin dimaleate,<br>
dimethyltin diacetate, dimethyltin dilaurate, dimethyltin mercaptide, dimethyltin<br>
dimaleate, triphenyltin acetate, triphenyltin hydroxide, 1,4-<br>
diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane, and/or triethylamine. Triorganotin materials such<br>
as those disclosed in U. S. Patent 5,902,871, col. 4, line 32 to col. 8, line 7,<br>
and U. S. Patent 5,880,178, col. 4, line 15 to col. 8, line 18, incorporated<br>
herein by reference, may be used. Bismuth catalysts as known in the art may<br>
also be used. Examples of blocking agents that may be used are phenols<br>
(e.g. phenol, nonylphenol, cresol), oximes (e.g. butanone oxime,<br>
cyclohexanone oxime), lactams (e.g. e-caprolactam), secondary amines (e.g.<br>
diisopropyl-amine) and pyrazoles (e.g. dimethylpyrazole), imidazoles,<br>
triazoles). Suitable examples of blocking agents most often used include 3,5-<br>
dimethylpyrazole and N-t-butylbenzyl amine. Mixtures of blocking agents may<br>
also be used.<br>
[0091] As noted above, the material of iii) further comprises at least one other<br>
different functional group capable of reacting with groups on the resinous<br>
material of i), groups on the curing agent of ii), groups on a superposed<br>
coating, and/or groups on the substrate. The functional groups may be any of<br>
those disclosed above in association with the resinous material or the curing<br>
agent. Alternatively, in certain embodiments, the functional group on the<br>
material of iii) comprises (meth)acryloyl, vinyl, ally!, maleinimido, trialkoxysilyl<br>
and/or haloalkyl.<br>
[0092] In particular embodiments, the material of iii) comprises blocked<br>
trialkoxysilylpropyl isocyanates such as triethoxysilylpropyl isocyanate and/or<br>
trimethoxysilylpropyl isocyanate blocked with, most often, 3,5-<br>
dimethylpyrazole.<br>
[0093] In a separate embodiment, the material of iii) may comprise a blocked<br>
isocyanatoalkyl(meth)acrylate such as isocyanatoethyl(meth)acrylate, most<br>
often blocked with 3,5-dimethylpyrazole. lsocyanatoethyl(meth)acrylate<br>
blocked with butanone oxime is also suitable and is available from Showa<br>
Denko K. K. as KarenzMOI-BM.<br>
[0094] The material of iii) is present in the curable film-forming composition at<br>
least in an amount sufficient to improve adhesion between the curable filmforming<br>
composition and the substrate and/or a superposed coating<br>
compared to a similar optical element that does not contain (i. e., is<br>
substantially free of) the material of iii) in the curable film-forming composition.<br>
Adhesion may be measured by a standard method, for example, ASTM D-<br>
3359-93 (Standard Test Method for Measuring Adhesion by Tape Test-<br>
Method B). Typically, the material of iii) is present in the curable film-forming<br>
composition in an amount up to 20 percent by weight, often up to 10 percent<br>
by weight, based on the total weight of resin solids in the curable film-forming<br>
composition.<br>
[0095] As discussed earlier, the optical element of the present invention is<br>
adapted to possess a light influencing property and may further comprise a<br>
material to provide a light influencing property. Such a material may be<br>
inorganic or organic and may be present in the substrate, curable film-forming<br>
composition and/or in a superposed coating or film as described below.<br>
[0096] A wide variety of photochromic materials may be used in the optical<br>
article of the present invention to provide a light influencing property. The<br>
photochromic materials may be provided in a variety of forms. Examples<br>
include: a single photochromic compound; a mixture of photochromic<br>
compounds; a material containing a photochromic compound, such as a<br>
monomeric or polymeric ungelled solution; a material such as a monomer or<br>
polymer to which a photochromic compound is chemically bonded; a material<br>
comprising and/or having chemically bonded to it a photochromic compound,<br>
the outer surface of the material being encapsulated (encapsulation is a form<br>
of coating), for example with a polymeric resin or a protective coating such as<br>
a metal oxide that prevents contact of the photochromic material with external<br>
materials such as oxygen, moisture and/or chemicals that have a negative<br>
effect on the photochromic material; such materials can be formed into a<br>
particulate prior to applying the protective coating as described in U.S.<br>
Patents 4,166,043 and 4,367,170; a photochromic polymer, e.g., a<br>
-28-<br>
photochromic polymer comprising photochromic compounds bonded together;<br>
or, mixtures thereof.<br>
[0097] The inorganic photochromic material may contain crystallites of silver<br>
halide, cadmium halide and/or copper halide. Other inorganic photochromic<br>
materials may be prepared by the addition of europium (II) and/or cerium(lll)<br>
to a mineral glass such as a soda-silica glass. In another embodiment, the<br>
inorganic photochromic materials are added to molten glass and formed into<br>
particles that are incorporated into the curable film-forming composition. Such<br>
inorganic photochromic materials are described in Kirk Othmer Encyclopedia<br>
of Chemical Technology. 4th Edition, Volume 6, pages 322-325.<br>
[0098] The photochromic material may be an organic photochromic material<br>
having an activated absorption maxima in the range from 300 to 1000<br>
nanometers. In one embodiment, the organic photochromic material<br>
comprises a mixture of (a) an organic photochromic material having a visible<br>
lambda max of from 400 to less than 550 nanometers, and (b) an organic<br>
photochromic material having a visible lambda max of from 550 to 700<br>
nanometers.<br>
[0099] The photochromic material may alternatively comprise an organic<br>
photochromic material that may be chosen from pyrans, oxazines, fulgides,<br>
fulgimides, diarylethenes and mixtures thereof.<br>
[00100] Non-limiting examples of photochromic pyrans that may be used<br>
herein include benzopyrans, and naphthopyrans, e.g., naphtho[1,2-b]pyrans,<br>

column 24, line 56 may be used. The disclosures of the aforementioned<br>
patents on polymerizable organic photochromic materials are incorporated<br>
herein by reference.<br>
[00104] The photochromic materials can be incorporated, for example, into<br>
the curable film-forming composition by various means. The photochromic<br>
materials may be incorporated, e.g., dissolved and/or dispersed, into the<br>
composition, or polymerized with other components of the composition.<br>
Alternatively, the photochromic materials may be incorporated into the<br>
composition by imbibition, permeation or other transfer methods as known by<br>
those skilled in the art.<br>
[00105] Typically the photochromic material is present in the optical element<br>
in a photochromic amount; that is, in an amount yielding a color change<br>
distinguishable by the naked eye upon exposure to radiation. In one<br>
embodiment, the amount of photochromic material incorporated into the<br>
curable film-forming composition may range from 0.5 to 40 weight percent<br>
based on the weight of the solids in the curable film-forming composition. In<br>
alternate embodiments, the amount of photochromic material ranges from 1 to<br>
30 weight percent, from 3 to 20 weight percent, or from 3 to 10 weight<br>
percent. The amount of photochromic material in the curable film-forming<br>
composition may range between any combination of these values, inclusive of<br>
the recited range.<br>
[00106] Adjuvant materials may also be incorporated into the curable filmforming<br>
composition. Such adjuvants may be incorporated prior to,<br>
simultaneously with or subsequent to application or incorporation of any<br>
photochromic material. For example, ultraviolet light absorbers may be<br>
admixed with photochromic materials before their addition to the composition<br>
or such absorbers may be superposed, e.g., superimposed, as a coating or<br>
-31-<br>
film between the curable film-forming composition and the incident light.<br>
However, caution should be exercised that the ultraviolet light absorbers are<br>
not used in such amounts as to interfere with the performance of the<br>
photochromic material, if present.<br>
[00107] In addition to ultraviolet light stabilizers, other adjuvants such as<br>
stabilizers may be used to improve the light fatigue resistance of<br>
photochromic materials. Non-limiting examples of stabilizers include hindered<br>
amine light stabilizers (HALS), asymmetric diaryloxalamide (oxanilides)<br>
compounds and singlet oxygen quenchers, e.g., a nickel ion complex with an<br>
organic ligand, polyphenolic antioxidants and mixtures of such stabilizers are<br>
contemplated. The adjuvants may be used in the photochromic adhesive<br>
individually or as a mixture, e.g., of stabilizers in combination with ultraviolet<br>
light absorbers, as known to those skilled in the art.<br>
[00108] Further adjuvant materials can be incorporated into the curable filmforming<br>
composition used in the optical element of the present invention, e.g.,<br>
conventional ingredients that aid in processing or impart desired<br>
characteristics to the resulting optical elements. Non-limiting examples of<br>
such ingredients include solvents, e.g., aqueous and/or organic solvents,<br>
rheology control agents, surfactants, initiators, catalysts, cure-inhibiting<br>
agents, reducing agents, acids, bases, preservatives, free radical donors, free<br>
radical scavengers and thermal stabilizers, which adjuvant materials are<br>
known to those skilled in the art.<br>
[00109] The optical element of the present invention may further comprise c)<br>
an at least partial film or coating superposed on the curable film-forming<br>
composition of b) and different therefrom. Such a coating or film may<br>
comprise, inter alia, a photochromic coating, tint coating, polarizing coating,<br>
and/or an abrasion resistant or other protective coating. Any of the coatings<br>
discussed earlier as applied directly to the substrate may additionally or<br>
alternatively be used as the superposed coating c). Likewise, any coatings<br>
discussed here below as the superposed coating c) may additionally or<br>
alternatively be applied directly to the substrate.<br>
[00110] The types of material used for the film or coating may vary widely and<br>
be chosen from the polymeric organic materials of the substrate and the<br>
-32-<br>
protective films described hereinafter. The thickness of the films of polymeric<br>
organic materials may vary widely. The thickness may range, for example,<br>
from 0.1 mil to 40 mils and any range of thicknesses between these values,<br>
inclusive of the recited values. However, if desired, greater thicknesses may<br>
be used.<br>
[00111] The polymeric organic materials may be chosen from thermosetting<br>
materials, thermoplastic materials and mixtures thereof. Such materials<br>
include the polymeric organic materials chosen for the substrate as well as<br>
protective films. Other examples of films of polymeric organic materials are<br>
disclosed in U.S. Patent Publication 2004/0096666 in paragraphs [0082] to<br>
[0098] which disclosure of such polymeric films is incorporated herein by<br>
reference.<br>
[00112] In certain embodiments, the film or coating c) comprises<br>
thermoplastic polymeric organic materials chosen from nylon, poly(vinyl<br>
acetate), vinyl chloride-vinyl acetate copolymer, poly (Ci-Cg alkyl) acrylates,<br>
poly (CrC8 alkyl) methacrylates, styrene-butadiene copolymer resin,<br>
poly(urea-urethanes), polyurethanes, polyterephthalates, polycarbonates,<br>
polycarbonate-silicone copolymer and mixtures thereof.<br>
[00113] Optionally, compatible (chemically and color-wise) fixed tint dyes may<br>
be added or applied to the substrate, curable film-forming composition, and/or<br>
superposed films to achieve a more aesthetic result, for medical reasons, or<br>
for reasons of fashion. For example, the dye may be selected to complement<br>
the color resulting from activated photochromic materials, e.g., to achieve a<br>
more neutral color or absorb a particular wavelength of incident light. In<br>
another embodiment, the dye may be selected to provide a desired hue to the<br>
host material when the photochromic materials are in an unactivated state.<br>
[00114] In a further embodiment, the aforementioned fixed tint dyes may be<br>
associated with the protective films described hereinafter used with the optical<br>
elements of the present invention as known to those skilled in the art. See for<br>
example, U.S. Patent 6,042,737 at column 4, line 43 to column 5, line 8,<br>
which disclosure related to tinting coated substrates is incorporated herein by<br>
reference.<br>
-33-<br>
[00115] Often, a protective film is typically applied to the substrate to prevent<br>
scratches from the effects of friction and abrasion. The protective film may<br>
also serve as the superposed film or coating c). The protective film connected<br>
to the optical element of the present invention, in a particular embodiment, is<br>
an at least partially abrasion resistant film. The phrase "an at least partially<br>
abrasion resistant film" refers to an at least partial film of an at least partially<br>
cured coating or sheet of a protective polymeric material that demonstrates a<br>
resistance to abrasion that is greater than the standard reference material,<br>
typically a plastic made of CR-39Â® monomer available from PPG Industries,<br>
Inc, as tested in a method comparable to ASTM F-735 Standard Test Method<br>
for Abrasion Resistance of Transparent Plastics and Coatings Using the<br>
Oscillating Sand Method.<br>
[00116] The protective film may be chosen from protective sheet materials,<br>
protective gradient films (which also provide a gradient in hardness for the<br>
films between which they are interposed), protective coatings and<br>
combinations thereof. Protective coatings such as hardcoats may be applied<br>
onto the surface of the polymeric film, the substrate and/or any applied films,<br>
e.g., superjacent to protective transitional films.<br>
[00117] When the protective film is chosen from protective sheet materials, it<br>
may be chosen from the protective polymeric sheet materials disclosed in<br>
paragraphs [0118] to [0126] of U.S. Patent Publication 2004/0096666.<br>
[00118] The protective gradient films provide an at least partially abrasion<br>
resistant film and may be subsequently coated with another protective film.<br>
The protective gradient film may serve to protect the article during shipping or<br>
subsequent handling prior to the application of the additional protective film.<br>
After application of an additional protective film, the protective gradient film<br>
provides a gradient in hardness from one applied film to another. The<br>
hardness of such films may be determined by methods known to those skilled<br>
in the art. In another non-limiting embodiment, a protective film is superjacent<br>
to a protective gradient film. Non-limiting examples of protective films<br>
providing such gradient properties include the radiation cured (meth)acrylatebased<br>
coatings described in U.S. Patent Application Publication<br>
-34-<br>
2003/0165686 in paragraphs [0010] to [0023] and [0079] to [0173],<br>
incorporated herein by reference.<br>
[00119] The protective films may also include protective coatings. Examples<br>
of protective coatings known in the art that provide abrasion and scratch<br>
resistance are chosen from polyfunctional acrylic hard coatings, melaminebased<br>
hard coatings, urethane-based hard coatings, alkyd-based coatings<br>
and organosilane type coatings. Non-limiting examples of such abrasion<br>
resistant coatings are disclosed in U.S. Patent Application 2004/0096666 in<br>
paragraphs [0128] to [0149], and in U.S. Patent Application 2004/0207809 in<br>
paragraphs [0205] to [0249], both disclosures incorporated herein by<br>

[00120] In one embodiment, the optical element of the present invention<br>
further comprises an at least partially polarizing surface treatment, coating, or<br>
film. The phrase "at least partially polarizing" means that from some to all of<br>
the vibrations of the electric field vector of lightwaves is confined to one<br>
direction or plane by the surface treatment. Such polarizing effects may be<br>
achieved by applying to the optical element a film having an aligned dichroic<br>
material to at least partially polarize transmitted radiation. In one non-limiting<br>
embodiment, a polymeric sheet is stretched to align the dichroic material<br>
applied to the polymeric sheet. In another non-limiting embodiment, a coating<br>
is cured in a directional fashion, e.g., using polarized ultraviolet radiation, to<br>
align the dichroic materials in the coating.<br>
[00121] In another embodiment, the optical element further comprises an at<br>
least partially antireflective surface treatment. The phrase "an at least<br>
partially antireflective surface" treatment means that there is an at least partial<br>
improvement in the antireflective nature of the optical element to which it is<br>
applied. In non-limiting embodiments, there may be a reduction in the amount<br>
of glare reflected by the surface of the treated optical element and/or an<br>
increase in the percent transmittance through the treated optical element as<br>
compared to an untreated optical element.<br>
[00122] In another non-limiting embodiment, an at least partially antireflective<br>
surface treatment, e.g., a monolayer or multilayer of metal oxides, metal<br>
fluorides, or other such materials, can be connected to the polymeric film<br>
-35-<br>
surface of the optical elements, e.g., lenses, of the present invention through<br>
vacuum evaporation, sputtering, or some other method.<br>
[00123] The optical element of the present invention may further comprise an<br>
at least partially hydrophobic surface treatment. The phrase "an at least<br>
partially hydrophobic surface" is a film that at least partially improves the<br>
water repellent nature of the substrate to which it is applied by reducing the<br>
amount of water from the surface that can adhere to the substrate as<br>
compared to an untreated substrate.<br>
[00124] The optical elements of the present invention may be produced by a<br>
variety of methods. The optical element of the present invention may be<br>
prepared by applying the curable film-forming composition to the substrate, for<br>
example, using any of the methods used in coating technology. Non-limiting<br>
examples include spray coating, spin coating, spin and spray coating, spread<br>
coating, curtain coating, dip coating, casting-coating, roll-coating, reverse roll<br>
coating, transfer roll coating, kiss/squeeze coating, gravure roll coating, blade<br>
coating, knife coating, and rod/bar coating.<br>
[00125] In one embodiment, when the optical element of the present<br>
invention further comprises a film or coating c) superposed on the curable<br>
film-forming composition of b), or when the optical element further comprises<br>
protective and/or other films, the curable film-forming composition of b) may<br>
be applied directly to the substrate, or may first be applied to the other film c)<br>
and the combination of the film-forming composition of b) and the additional<br>
film c) may be applied as a composite to the substrate, such as by lamination.<br>
[00126] The optical elements of the present invention may alternatively be<br>
prepared by utilizing a mold of a chosen design as the front mold, the curable<br>
film-forming composition of b), and a preformed optical substrate i), e.g., a<br>
preformed lens substrate, having a generally convex front surface, a generally<br>
concave back surface and a predetermined lens correction (if any) at its<br>
optical center, as a back mold. The method of forming lenses as disclosed in<br>
U.S. Patent 4,873,029 may also be used to form the optical elements of the<br>
present invention.<br>
[00127] Following application of the curable film-forming composition to the<br>
surface of the substrate, any solvent used to prepare the curable film-forming<br>
-36-<br>
composition may be evaporated. This may occur before, during and/or after<br>
applying any subsequent coatings. The curable film-forming composition may<br>
also be at least partially cured before, during and/or after applying any<br>
superposed films or coatings. This may be accomplished, for example, by<br>
exposing a UV-curable composition to ultraviolet radiation before, during<br>
and/or after the process of connecting the at least partial film to it.<br>
[00128] Methods used for curing the curable film-forming composition include<br>
solvent evaporation, radical polymerization, thermal curing,<br>
photopolymerization or a combination thereof. Additional methods include<br>
irradiating the polymerizable material with infrared, ultraviolet, gamma or<br>
electron radiation so as to initiate the polymerization reaction of any<br>
polymerizable components, or to initiate crosslinking mechanisms. This may<br>
be followed by a heating step. If the temperature of the curing method does<br>
not at least achieve 100Â°C, a separate heating step to at least 100Â°C may be<br>
performed to allow for deblocking of the isocyanate material of iii).<br>
[00129] The present invention is more particularly described in the following<br>
examples that are intended as illustration only, since numerous modifications<br>
and variations therein will be apparent to those skilled in the art.<br>
Examples<br>
[00130] Examples 1 and 3 demonstrate preparation of adhesion promoters to<br>
be used in optical elements of the present invention. In Example 1, a<br>
triethoxysilylpropyl isocyanate blocked with 3,5-dimethylpyrazole (DMP) is<br>
prepared. Example 2 is a comparative example, illustrating the preparation of<br>
triethoxysilylpropyl isocyanate blocked with Nethylaminoisobutyltrimethoxysilane.<br>
Example 3 illustrates the preparation of<br>
3,5-dimethylpyrazole-blocked trimethoxysilylpropyl isocyanate.<br>
Example 1<br>
[00131] Triethoxysilylpropyl isocyanate (25 g, 0.1 moles) was weighed into<br>
100 ml round bottom jacketed round bottom flask equipped with a refrigerated<br>
circulator, thermometer and magnetic stirrer. Ethyl acetate (25 grams) was<br>
weighed into the flask. 3,5-dimethylpyrazole (9.4 grams, 0.1 moles) was<br>
added to the stirring mixture in 5 separate additions. After each addition the<br>
-37-<br>
temperature increased. The next addition was made once the temperature<br>
decreased to 
final addition. The ethyl acetate was removed on a rotary evaporator to<br>
provide a clear viscous liquid. The absence of free isocyanate was confirmed<br>
by infrared spectroscopy. The blocked isocyanate chemical structure was<br>
confirmed by proton NMR.<br>
Example 2 (Comparative)<br>
[00132] The same procedure as in Example 1 was followed except that the<br>
liquid N-ethylaminoisobutyltrimethoxysilane (21.3g) was added dropwise to<br>
the stirring at a rate such that the temperature remained at 28Â°C. Once the<br>
addition was complete the temperature was raised to 50Â°C for 20 minutes<br>
then cooled to room temperature. The ethyl acetate was removed on a rotary<br>
evaporator to provide a clear viscous liquid that yellowed over time. The<br>
absence of free isocyanate was confirmed by infrared spectroscopy. The<br>
blocked isocyanate chemical structure was confirmed by proton NMR. The<br>
ratio of ethoxy protons to methoxy protons indicated some hydrolysis<br>
occurred.<br>
Example 3<br>
[00133] The same procedure as in Example 1 was used except that instead of<br>
stirring for 24 hours after the final DMP addition, the mixture was heated to<br>
50Â°C for 30 minutes. The ethyl acetate was removed on a rotary evaporator<br>
to provide a clear viscous liquid. The absence of free isocyanate was<br>
confirmed by infrared spectroscopy. The blocked isocyanate chemical<br>
structure was confirmed by proton NMR.<br>
Example 4<br>
[00134] In the following example, piano PDQ coated polycarbonate lenses<br>
obtained from Gentex Optics were used. The test lenses were treated with an<br>
oxygen plasma for 1 minute using a Plasmatech machine at a power setting<br>
of 100 Watts while introducing oxygen at a rate of 100 ml/min into the vacuum<br>
chamber of the Plasmatech machine. The lenses were then rinsed with<br>
-38-<br>
deionized water and dried with air. A photochromic polyurethane coating<br>
composition was applied to the plasma treated lenses by spin coating and<br>
thermally cured. The components of the polyurethane composition and their<br>
amounts are tabulated in Table 1. The components of the polyurethane<br>
composition were mixed for 30 minutes at 60 Â°C, followed by 30 minutes of<br>
mixing at ambient temperature prior to being applied to the lenses. The<br>
photochromic polyurethane coating was approximately 20 microns thick.<br>

-39-<br>
(0.25pph acrylate) of BAPO photoinitiator [bis(2,4,6-trimethylbenzoyl) phenyl<br>

supplier to be a 50/50 blend of neopentylglycol-2-propoxylated diacrylate and<br>
a dendritic polyester acrylate in which approximately 13 of the 16 terminal<br>
hydroxy groups have been acrylated. The materials shown in Table 1 were<br>
added to eight of the nine coating preparations at 2.5pph acrylate and/or<br>
5.0pph acrylate levels.<br>

[00136] The photochromic polyurethane coating on the test lenses were<br>
treated by plasma discharge using the Plasmatech machine using the same<br>
conditions used to treat the uncoated piano lenses. The dendritic polyester<br>
acrylate coating preparations were applied to the test lenses by spin coating<br>
to give a wet film weight of approximately 0.06 grams (approximately 10<br>
microns thickness). The coatings were cured in a nitrogen atmosphere with<br>
UV light from a D bulb. Half of the lenses were tested for AB coating<br>
adhesion to the hardcoated polycarbonate lenses using the Crosshatch peel<br>
test.<br>
[00137] The other half of the test lenses there were treated with an oxygen<br>
plasma for 1 minute using a Plasmatech machine at a power setting of 100<br>
Watts while introducing oxygen at a rate of 100 ml/min into the vacuum<br>
chamber of the Plasmatech machine. A non-tintable abrasion resistant<br>

coating composition, Table 2, was applied onto the lenses and the samples<br>
cured for 3 hours at 100Â°C in a convection oven.<br>

[00140] Charge A was stirred in the flask at a temperature of 100Â°C until all<br>
solids were dissolved. Charge B was added and the mixture was reheated to<br>
80Â°C. Charge C was added over a 15 minute period and the resulting mixture<br>
was held at 80Â°C for 3 hours. Charge D was added and the mixture was<br>
cooled to room temperature. The final product was an extremely viscous<br>
-42-<br>
clear yellow solution with an acid value of 38.9 and a percent solids of 82%.<br>
The acid value was measured by potentiometric titration with KOH. The<br>
percent solids was determined by adding a known amount of the material to<br>
an aluminum pan, adding additional water to dilute the material and more<br>
evenly distribute it over the pan. The pan was placed in an oven at 110 Â°C for<br>
1 hour. The pan was then re-weighed and the percent solids were<br>
determined from the remaining mass (minus the pan) divided by the initial<br>
mass (minus the pan).<br>

(7) A non-ionic surfactant available from Rhodia.<br>
[00144] A pre-emulsion was prepared by stirring Charge A in a glass beaker.<br>
Of the pre-emulsion, 132.37 g was recycled for 15 minutes through a<br>
MicrofluidizerÂ® M110T at 8000 psi and 28Â°C while Charge B was added in<br>
order. The MicrofluidizerÂ® M110T is available from the Microfluidicsâ¢ division<br>
of MFIC Corporation, Newton, MA. The resulting microemulsion was<br>
transferred to a fourneck round bottom flask equipped with an overhead<br>
stirrer, condenser, electronic temperature probe, and a nitrogen inlet. Charge<br>
C was added rapidly as a mixture and then Charge D was added as a mixture<br>
over a period of 30 minutes. The temperature rose from 30Â°C to 33Â°C as<br>
Charge D was added. Finally, Charge E was added to produce a milky purple<br>
dispersion with a pH of 8. The dispersion was 31% solids.<br>

[00147] PDQ coated Gentex polycarbonate piano lenses were corona treated<br>
for 4 seconds while spinning ~ 1 inch from the corona discharge. The spin<br>
speed was about 200 RPM.<br>
[00148] The coating solutions were applied to the corona treated lenses for 3-<br>
5 seconds at 1200 RPM to achieve wet film weights of 0.18 to 0.22g. 4<br>
lenses for each solution were coated.<br>
[00149] The cure cycle was 80Â°C for 20-25 min., 120Â°C for 1 hour. 1/2 of<br>
each coating type was allowed 3 additional hours post cure at 100Â°C.<br>
[00150] The adhesion test was as follows: A dry cross-hatch with 2 tape pulls<br>
(Scotch tape, 600) was performed prior to any further lens treatment and the<br>
primary adhesion was recorded. The lenses were then boiled in de-ionized<br>
water for 30 minutes. After cooling to room temperature, the cross-hatch and<br>
tape pull test was repeated, recording the results. No loss of primary<br>
adhesion was observed in any of the samples in the initial (dry) test. The data<br>

in the table only shows the secondary adhesion loss results. Table 4 below<br>
shows the results with the blocked isocyanate adhesion promoters relative to<br>
other silane coupling agents.<br>

Shelf-Life Tests<br>
[00151] The coating solutions above were monitored over time to determine<br>
the shelf-life of these solutions. Only the solutions containing silane coupling<br>
agents that provided 0% adhesion loss (Examples 6-1, 6-5, and 6-8) were<br>
monitored. Examples 6-1 and 6-8 typically gelled in 2-3 days. Example 6-5<br>
did not exhibit unacceptable viscosity increase until 2 - 3 weeks.<br>
[00152] Whereas particular embodiments of this invention have been<br>
described above for purposes of illustration, it will be evident to those skilled<br>
