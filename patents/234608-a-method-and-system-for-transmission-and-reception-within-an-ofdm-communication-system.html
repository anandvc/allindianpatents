				<td>A METHOD AND SYSTEM FOR TRANSMISSION AND RECEPTION<br>
WITHIN AN OFDM COMMUNICATION SYSTEM<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates generally to a method and system for<br>
transmission and reception within an OFDM communication system and<br>
generally to communication systems.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) is a well-known<br>
multicarrier modulation method that is used in several wireless system standards.<br>
Some of the systems using OFDM include 5 GHz high data rate wireless LANs<br>
(EEEE802.11 a, HiperLan2, MMAC), digital audio and digital video broadcast in<br>
Europe (DAB and DVB-T, respectively), and broadband fixed wireless systems<br>
such as E3EE802.16a. An OFDM system divides the available bandwidth into<br>
very many narrow frequency bands (subcarriers), with data being transmitted in<br>
parallel on the subcarriers. Each subcarrier utilizes a different portion of the<br>
occupied frequency band.<br>
Spreading can also be applied to the data in an OFDM system to provide<br>
various forms of multicarrier spread spectrum. Such spread-OFDM systems are<br>
generally referred to as either Spread OFDM (SOFDM), multicarrier CDMA<br>
(MC-CDMA), or Orthogonal Frequency Code Division Multiplexing (OFCDM).<br>
For systems employing MC-CDMA, spreading is applied in the frequency<br>
dimension and multiple signals (users) can occupy the same set of subcarriers by<br>
using different spreading codes. For OFCDM, different users are assigned<br>
different mutually orthogonal spreading codes, and the spread signals are<br>
combined prior to transmission on the downlink. Spreading can be applied in the<br>
frequency dimension, or the time dimension, or a combination of time and<br>
frequency spreading can be used. In any case, orthogonal codes such as Walsh<br>
codes are used for the spreading function, and multiple data symbols can be code<br>
multiplexed onto different Walsh codes (i.e., multi-code transmission).<br>
For an OFCDM system with a spreading factor of SF in the time<br>
dimension, in which each symbol is represented by SF chips, up to SF Walsh<br>
codes can be active on each subcarrier. For channel estimation, one of these<br>
Walsh codes can be assigned as a pilot signal (i.e., in the same way that a pilot<br>
signal is created in conventional single-carrier CDMA systems such as IS-95). In<br>
order to estimate more than one channel (such as measuring the channels from<br>
two transmit antennas), additional Walsh channels can be assigned as pilot<br>
channels. However, note that assigning a second Walsh channel as a pilot<br>
doubles the pilot overhead of the system, leading to a reduction in the number of<br>
Walsh codes available for data transmission. This additional overhead is very<br>
significant in systems with a small spreading factor and/or a large number of<br>
transmit antennas. Therefore, a need exists for a method and apparatus for<br>
transmitting and receiving data from multiple antennas within an OFDM system<br>
that eliminates the need for multiple spreading codes being used for pilot<br>
channels emanating from multiple antennas.<br>

symbols in an OFDM-based system.<br>

Detailed Description of the Drawings<br>
In order to address the above-mentioned need, the same Walsh code will<br>
be used at the same time for a plurality of transmitters. The multiple transmitters<br>
can be from the same, or different devices (e.g., different base stations on the<br>
downlink, different terminals on the uplink). Each subcarrier/antenna combination<br>
will share a similar pilot Walsh code, except for the fact that the scrambled spread<br>
pilot signals will be phase shifted on some subcarriers of some antennas, based on<br>
the subcarrier/antenna combination.<br>
Because a single spreading code (e.g., Walsh code) can be used for pilot<br>
channels originating from differing antennas/subcarriers pilot overhead is greatly<br>
reduced. Additionally, with this choice of pilot channels, the channel responses of<br>
the different transmitters of interest become separable. In order to perform the<br>
separation, processing is preferably performed over all of the pilot subcarriers<br>
after despreading the pilot channel to separate the pilot from the data channels, as<br>
described below.<br>
The present invention encompasses a method comprising the steps of<br>
determining a first subcarrier for spread pilot data transmission, determining a<br>
second subcarrier for spread pilot data transmission, and adjusting a phase of the<br>
spread pilot data a first amount to produce a first phase adjusted spread pilot. The<br>
phase of the spread pilot data is adjusted a second amount to produce a second<br>
phase-adjusted spread pilot and the first phase-adjusted spread pilot is transmitted<br>
on a first antenna/subcarrier combination. Finally the second phase-adjusted<br>
spread pilot is transmitted on a second antenna/subcarrier combination wherein<br>
the second amount differs from the first amount by a predetermined phase value<br>
based on the first and the second subcarrier/antenna combinations.<br>
The present invention additionally encompasses a system comprising a<br>
first rnulticarrier transmitter outputting a first spread pilot signal over a first<br>
spreading block interval on a first plurality of subcarriers, and a second<br>
multicarrier transmitter outputting a second spread pilot signal on the first<br>
plurality of subcarriers within the spreading block interval, wherein for each of the<br>
plurality of subcarriers, the second spread pilot signal differs from the first pilot<br>
signal by a predetermined phase amount.<br>
The present invention additionally encompasses a system comprising a<br>
first multicarrier transmitter outputting a first pilot signal on a first plurality of<br>
symbol periods on a first subcarrier, and a second multicarrier transmitter<br>
outputting a second pilot signal on the first plurality of symbol periods on the first<br>
subcarrier, wherein for each symbol period within the plurality of symbol periods,<br>
the first and the second pilot signals differ by a predetermined phase amount.<br>
The present invention additionally encompasses a method comprising the<br>
steps of receiving a first multicarrier signal comprising a first spread pilot signal<br>
over a first spreading block interval on a first plurality of subcarriers, and<br>
receiving a second multicarrier signal comprising a second spread pilot signal on<br>
the first plurality of subcarriers within the spreading block interval, wherein for<br>
each of the plurality of subcarriers, the second spread pilot signal differs from the<br>
first pilot signal by a predetermined phase amount.<br>
Finally, the present invention encompasses a method comprising the steps<br>
of receiving a first multicarrier transmission comprising a first pilot signal over a<br>
first plurality of symbol periods on a first subcarrier, and receiving a second<br>
multicarrier transmission comprising a second pilot signal over the first plurality<br>
of symbol periods on the first subcarrier, wherein for each symbol within the<br>
symbol period, the first and the second pilot differ by a predetermined phase<br>
amount.<br>
Turning now to the drawings, wherein like numerals designate like<br>
components, figures 1 and 2 show examples of prior-art methods for including<br>
pilot symbols in an OFDM-based system. Note that these prior art methods can be<br>
used for systems that transmit regular OFDM data, or spread data (such as MC-<br>
CDMA, OFCDM). However, note that each individual pilot symbol occupies only<br>
"one subcarrier by one OFDM symbol period", and also note that the pilot and<br>
data are not code multiplexed. Instead, the pilot symbols are separated in time<br>
and/or frequency from the data. In these prior art methods, a channel estimate may<br>
be obtained at each pilot symbol location, which is separate from the data or<br>
spread data locations. Then, the channel may be estimated at other locations in the<br>
time-frequency grid, especially locations where data or spread data is located, so<br>
the data can be despread and detected. The pilot configuration shown in FIG. 1 is<br>
commonly known as a "pilot tone" based approach, since certain subcarriers<br>
contain only pilot symbols at each time interval. In FIG. 1, note that the<br>
subcarriers used for the pilot tones cannot be used for transmitting data. For the<br>
pilot tone approach, methods have been proposed for encoding the pilot tones<br>
such that multiple channels can be estimated, but these methods have limited<br>
utility since the number of required pilot tones is proportional to the number of<br>
channels to be estimated.<br>
In contrast with the prior art methods of FIG. 1 and FIG. 2, the preferred<br>
embodiment of the present invention uses a spread pilot that is code multiplexed<br>
with spread data, as illustrated in FIG. 3. Particularly, FIG. 3 illustrates an<br>
OFCDM system with spreading in the time dimension. The time-frequency grid<br>
for this type of a system with SF = 8 is shown where each symbol is spread with 8<br>
chips. The eight chips are then transmitted on a particular frequency (subcarrier).<br>
As shown in FIG. 3, eight chips representing a first symbol are transmitted on<br>
subcarrier 1, followed by another eight chips representing another symbol. Similar<br>
transmissions occur on subcarriers 2 through 4. Up to SF symbols can be code<br>
multiplexed onto the same time/frequency space. For example, up to SF symbols<br>
can be code multiplexed onto the same subcarrier during a single spreading block<br>
interval, b. In a system with a code multiplexed pilot, at least one of the Walsh<br>
codes is used as a pilot channel. Note that in contrast to the pilot tone approach of<br>
FIG. 1, the code multiplexed approach enables both a pilot and user data to be<br>
simultaneously present on every subcarrier. If a pilot was included on every<br>
subcarrier in the pilot tone approach, note that the pilot overhead would be 100%<br>
and the system would not be able to transmit any user data.<br>
The composite signal at a particular location in the time-frequency grid is<br>
described as<br>
where:<br>
b is the spreading block interval index (note that b increases by one every SF<br>
OFDM symbol periods);<br>
n is the chip index within the 6th spreading block interval. Note that n increments<br>
from 1 to SF within each spreading block interval b;<br>
k is the subcarrier index, 1 = k = K;<br>
c denotes the scrambling code;<br>
i is the Walsh code index, 1 = i = SF<br>
p denotes the Walsh code index that is used for the pilot channel;<br>
Wi denotes the z-th Walsh code;<br>
At denotes the (real) gain applied to the i-th Walsh code channel (e.g., based on<br>
power control settings, if any); and<br>
di denotes the complex data symbol that modulates the z-th Walsh code. dp denotes<br>
the pilot symbol that modulates the pth Walsh code channel (i.e., the pilot<br>
channel).<br>
As discussed above, for an OFCDM system with a spreading factor of SF<br>
in the time dimension, in which each symbol is represented by SF chips, up to SF<br>
Walsh codes can be active on each subcarrier. For channel estimation, one of<br>
these Walsh codes can be assigned as a pilot signal (i.e., in the same way that a<br>
pilot signal is created in conventional single-carrier CDMA systems such as IS-<br>
95). In order to estimate more than one channel (such as measuring the channels<br>
from two transmit antennas in systems with space-time coding, MIMO,<br>
beamforming, or other types of transmit antenna array processing, or when<br>
multiple transmitters are using the same channel), additional Walsh channels can<br>
be assigned as pilot channels. For example, Walsh code number 1 can be used for<br>
a pilot channel on antenna 1, Walsh code 2 can be used for a pilot channel on<br>
antenna 2, leaving Walsh codes 3 through SF available for data transmission.<br>
However, assigning a second Walsh channel as a pilot for the second antenna<br>
doubles the pilot overhead of the system, leading to a reduction in the number of<br>
Walsh codes available for data transmission. In order to address this issue, the<br>
present invention enables the same Walsh code to be used at the same time for a<br>
plurality of transmitters . The multiple transmitters can be from the same, or<br>
different devices (e.g., different base stations on the downlink, different terminals<br>
on the uplink). Each subcarrier/antenna combination will share a similar pilot<br>
Walsh code, except for the fact that the scrambled spread pilot signals will be<br>
phase shifted on some subcarriers of some antennas, based on the<br>
subcarrier/antenna combination.<br>
The phases can be chosen as follows. Let the first transmitter's pilot<br>
channel (m = 1) be chosen arbitrarily. Then, the other transmitters of interest (m &gt;<br>
1) use a pilot channel derived as follows:<br><br>
where ß is a parameter less than 1. The value of p is related to the number of<br>
transmitters that can be accommodated by the proposed method. Thus, the above<br>
formula results in each pilot being shifted by a constant value multiplied by an<br>
integer (e.g., subcarrier index). For a system with an OFDM symbol period of Ts<br>
(excluding the cyclic prefix), the pilot format above will accommodate up to 1/ß<br>
transmitters, assuming that the cyclic prefix length is at least PTs. Also, it is<br>
assumed that the channel impulse response length associated with each transmitter<br>
is less than PTs. When these conditions are satisfied, a receiver can separate the<br>
channel responses of the different transmitters using signal processing techniques,<br>
as will be described later. Note that if the assumed conditions are not satisfied,<br>
some distortion or crosstalk can occur between the channel estimates of the<br>
different transmitters. However, depending on the channel estimation accuracy<br>
required by the specific application, such distortion may be acceptable.<br>
Note that the present invention provides a substantial improvement over a<br>
prior-art pilot tone based approach, which for example may have a pilot tone<br>
spacing of 5 subcarriers and would then only be able to estimate 1/5 as many<br>
channels as the preferred embodiment of the present invention. In order to match<br>
the capability of the present invention, the pilot tone spacing in the pilot tone<br>
approach must be reduced to 1 subcarrier, resulting in pilot tones on every<br>
subcarrier and leaving no subcarriers for user data transmission.<br>
For simplicity, we also assume that the pilot channel power control gain<br>
value Ap (b,k) is the same on each transmitter of interest (i.e., the same for all<br>
m). The proposed method is still applicable if the A values are different, but the<br>
resulting channel estimates will be scaled by the ratio of the assumed A and the<br>
actual A. This scale factor can be removed if the relative or absolute A values are<br>
known (based on a signaling channel, for example).<br>
Note that it is possible for the transmitters of interest to use different<br>
scrambling codes and a different Walsh index for the pilot channel, as long as the<br>
combination of the scrambling code and pilot Walsh code for each transmitter of<br>
interest is identical except for an arbitrary phase rotation. However, from a<br>
practical implementation perspective, the simplest way to satisfy the above<br>
equation is to use the same scrambling code and the same Walsh index in each<br>
transmitter of interest. In this latter case, the method can be implemented by<br>
appropriately modulating the pilot Walsh code, namely<br><br>
Because a single spreading code (e.g., Walsh code) can be used for pilot<br>
channels originating from differing antennas/subcarriers, pilot overhead is greatly<br>
reduced. Additionally, with this choice of pilot channels, the channel responses of<br>
the different transmitters of interest become separable. In order to perform the<br>
separation, processing is performed over all of the pilot subcarriers after<br>
despreading the pilot channel to separate the pilot from the data channels, as<br>
described below.<br>
FIG. 4 illustrates such a spread OFDM system. As is evident, multiple<br>
transmitters 401 utilize multiple antennas to transmit data on multiple subcarriers<br>
(frequencies) to receiver 402. In its simplest sense, multistream transmission can<br>
be thought of as the transmission of multiple data streams, from a single<br>
transmitter source, using multiple transmit antennas. Each data stream is<br>
transmitted utilizing one or more subcarriers and a spreading code. Receiver 402<br>
receives and processes the signals to reconstruct the transmitted multistream data.<br>
As discussed above, each antenna requires a pilot channel for coherent<br>
demodulation, In order to reduce the number of pilot channels, a single pilot<br>
channel is utilized and the pilot signal on the pilot channel from the different<br>
antennas has its phase adjusted based on the antenna/subcarrier combination.<br>
FIG. 5 is a block diagram of transmitter 401. As shown, transmitter 401<br>
comprises de-multiplexer 501, spreaders 502 and 504, phase shifter 505, and<br>
OFDM modulator/transmitter 506. For simplicity, data from a single user (e.g.,<br>
uplink) or for a single user (e.g., downlink) is shown in FIG. 5, however one of<br>
ordinary skill in the art will recognize that in typical OFCDM transmitters,<br>
multiple users transmit (or are transmitted to) simultaneously with up to SF<br>
symbols occupying the same time/frequency space. During operation a data<br>
stream from/for a user enters de-multiplexer 501 where the data stream is de-<br>
multiplexed into a plurality of data streams. Typical de-multiplexing operations<br>
convert a data stream at a given data rate (R) into N data streams each having a<br>
data rate of R/N.<br>
Continuing, the de-multiplexed data streams enter spreader 502 where<br>
standard spreading occurs, producing a plurality of chip streams. Particularly, for<br>
an example scenario where the data and spreading codes are binary, spreader 502<br>
modulo 2 adds an orthogonal code (e.g., an 8 chip Walsh code) to data symbol.<br>
For example, in 8 chip spreading, data symbols are each replaced by an 8 chip<br>
spreading code or its inverse, depending on whether the data symbol was a 0 or 1.<br>
More generally, the spreading code is modulated by a complex data symbol, for<br>
example dt in the earlier equations; this complex data symbol may be selected<br>
from a M-ary QAM or M-ary PSK constellation, for example. The spreading code<br>
preferably corresponds to a Walsh code from an 8 by 8 Hadamard matrix wherein<br>
a Walsh code is a single row or column of the matrix. Thus, for each data stream,<br>
spreader 502 repetitively outputs a Walsh code modulated by the present input<br>
data symbol value. It should be noted that in alternate embodiments of the present<br>
invention additional spreading or other operations may occur by spreader 502. For<br>
example, power control and/or scrambling (with a real or complex scrambling<br>
code) may be done, as shown in the previous equation.<br>
In the preferred embodiment of the present invention a single pilot per sub-channel<br>
is broadcast along with each symbol stream, providing channel estimation<br>
to aid in subsequent demodulation of multiple transmitted signals. The single pilot<br>
channel is utilized by all users receiving data during the particular frequency/time<br>
period. In an alternate embodiment, the number of channels that can be estimated<br>
can be further multiplied by allocating different pilot Walsh codes to different<br>
groups of transmitters. The channels of different groups of transmitters are then<br>
orthogonal in the code domain, while transmitters within a group are separable<br>
using the phase shifted pilot techniques as described in the preferred embodiment.<br>
In additional alternate embodiments of the present invention, the transmission of<br>
the pilot channel may be "skipped" at various time periods/subcarriers in order to<br>
transmit more data when the channel conditions allow. Such a skipping pattern<br>
can be either predetermined or adaptive. A receiver, knowing the sequence and<br>
time interval, utilizes this information in demodulating/decoding the non-pilot<br>
broadcasts, which preferably occur on different spreading codes than the pilot.<br>
Thus in the preferred embodiment of the present invention a pilot stream<br>
(comprising a known symbol pattern) enters spreader 504, where it is<br>
appropriately spread utilizing a code from the 8 orthogonal codes.<br>
The pilot chip stream is then phase shifted via phase shifters 505. Note that<br>
the output of phase shifters 505 are normally complex values. That is, even if the<br>
spread pilot only contains a real component, the phase shift applied to the spread<br>
pilot can be a value that causes the output to contain both real and imaginary parts.<br>
The phase shifter operation can be modeled as multiplying the spread pilot by a<br>
complex value of exp(j), where the value of <j> depends on the antenna/subcarrier<br>
pair.<br>
Since "phase shifting" is implemented at complex baseband on several<br>
different subcarriers of a complex signal, it cannot be practically implemented<br>
with simple RF phase shifters. Instead, phase shifters 505 serve to modulate the<br>
spread pilot with a particular complex phasor/sinusoid, whose frequency and<br>
phase depend on the antenna/subcarrier combination. As discussed above, the<br>
amount of phase shifting will depend on the antenna/subcarrier combination. Note<br>
that the phase-shifted spread pilot chip stream can be generated in various ways<br>
that produce an equivalent result. For example, the phase shift could be applied to<br>
the pilot symbol prior to spreading, or to the chips after spreading, or it could be<br>
otherwise embedded in the spreading code or the pilot symbol. The phase-shifted<br>
pilot chip stream is then summed with each data chip stream via summers 503. It<br>
should be noted that data for more than one data stream may be summed at<br>
summers 503. In other words data for each user transmitted during the particular<br>
frequency/time period will have chips of multiple spreading codes summed at<br>
summers 503. The resulting summed chip stream is output to transmitter 5.06.<br>
It should be noted that for simplicity only a single transmitter 401 is shown<br>
in FIG. 5, however, one of ordinary skill in the art will recognize simultaneous<br>
transmissions by multiple transmitters will be occurring. This results in at least a<br>
first transmitter outputting a first spread pilot signal over a first spreading block<br>
interval on a first plurality of subcarriers and a second transmitter outputting a<br>
second spread pilot signal on the first plurality of subcarriers within the spreading<br>
block interval, wherein for each of the plurality of subcarriers, the second spread<br>
pilot signal differs from the first pilot signal by a predetermined phase amount. As<br>
discussed above, shifting specific chip streams on the different subcarrier/antenna<br>
combinations (frequencies) allows for a single pilot channel code to be utilized<br>
amongst the various subcarrier/antenna combinations so that more of the Walsh<br>
codes can be allocated to data channels rather than pilot channels.<br>
FIG. 6 is a flow chart showing operation of the transmitter of FIG. 5 in<br>
accordance with the preferred embodiment of the present invention. The logic<br>
flow begins at step 601 where a data stream from/for a user is de-multiplexed into<br>
a plurality of data streams. At step 603 each data stream is spread with a particular<br>
spreading code. Simultaneously, at step 605 the pilot stream is spread with a<br>
particular spreading code and is phased shifted dependent upon the particular<br>
subcarrier and antenna that it is to be broadcasted on. Note that the phase shift can<br>
be implemented in various ways that produce an equivalent result. For example,<br>
the phase shift could be applied to the pilot symbol prior to spreading, or to the<br>
chips after spreading, or it could be otherwise embedded in the spreading code or<br>
the pilot symbol. At step 607 the spread data streams are summed with the phase-<br>
shifted pilot streams. Finally at step 609 OFDM modulation and transmission<br>
occurs. The above-described procedure takes place for preferably all, but at least<br>
some pilot transmissions in the system. For example, for two differing pilot<br>
transmissions, the subcarriers are determined and the phase of the first spread pilot<br>
data is adjusted a first amount (which may be zero) and transmitted while the<br>
phase of the second spread pilot data is adjusted a second amount and transmitted.<br>
As discussed above, the phase adjustment is based on an antenna/subcarrier<br>
combination. Also note, that each subcarrier may be transmitted on the same<br>
antenna or, that a single subcarrier may be transmitted on differing antennas.<br>
FIG. 7 is a block diagram of receiver 402. Receiver 402 is designed to<br>
receive a first multicarrier signal comprising a first spread pilot signal over a first<br>
spreading block interval (or symbol period) on a first plurality of subcarriers and a<br>
second multicarrier signal comprising a second spread pilot signal on the first<br>
plurality of subcarriers within the spreading block interval (or symbol period). As<br>
discussed above, for each of the plurality of subcarriers, the second spread pilot<br>
signal differs from the first pilot signal by a predetermined phase amount.<br>
As shown, receiver 402 comprises OFDM receiver 701, data despreader<br>
703, demodulator 705, filter 707, pilot despreader 709, and gain/phase<br>
compensation circuitry 711. During operation, the Walsh codes are reordered so<br>
that the pilots are sent on the first Walsh code (it should be clarified that this is<br>
only assumed here for notational convenience - there is no need to use any<br>
particular Walsh code for pilot transmission), which is the same on all antennas.<br>
Hence the received signal (with the block index b implicit) is given by<br>
where it is assumed the scrambling code is the same across all antennas, and the<br>
pilot channel power control gain value is the same on all antennas and is<br>
where MT is the number of transmit antennas, hm (n,k) is the channel for the mth<br>
antenna, and ?(n,k) is thermal noise at the nth OFDM symbol, kth subcarrier.<br>
During operation, OFDM receiver 701 receives multiple subcarriers (multicarrier<br>
signal) and demodulates them producing a plurality of chip streams. The pilot<br>
channel is despread via despreader 709 by multiplying the received signal by the<br>
conjugate of the pilot's Walsh code times the scrambling code and summing the<br>
elements. The pilot symbols are then demodulated via gain/phase compensation<br>
circuitry 711 by dividing out the gain and pilot symbol:<br>
Now assuming the channel is approximately constant during the spreading block,<br>
the data channels cancel due to the orthogonality of the Walsh codes, leaving<br>
is the despread noise contribution.<br>
Note that h(k) has contributions from each antenna, but the channels are<br>
each multiplied by a complex exponential "phase-ramp" across subcarrier index k,<br>
where the slope of the ramp is given by the antenna index m. This is the key<br>
property that allows separation of the multiple antennas that all use the same pilot<br>
code. It relies on the lowpass nature of the channel hm (n,k) across subcarrier k<br>
due to the limited delay-spread of the channels.<br>
The channels for each antenna may be obtained via filter 707 by filtering<br>
that can be implemented in several ways. One way is to take a single IFFT, and<br>
for each transmitter, apply a multiplicative window to the time-domain channel<br>
after circularly shifting the IFFT result so the desired transmitter's channel is<br>
centered at zero in the time-domain. Then the channel is obtained by taking an<br>
FFT for each transmitter. Another approach to the filtering is in the frequency<br>
domain directly on each transmitter after removing the phase shift.<br>
In either case, the channel for the mth antenna is mathematically obtained<br>
via filter 707 by applying a low pass filter to all subcarriers,<br>
where g(l,k),1 = l = K estimation filter coefficients for the kth<br>
subcarrier. Note that some of the g(l,k) may be zero. The channel estimates are<br>
passed from filter 707 to data demodulator 705 where demodulation of the<br>
despread data takes place. In particular, receiver 701 passes the chip stream to<br>
data despreader 703 where the chip stream is despread to produce a symbol<br>
stream. The symbol stream enters demodulator where coherent demodulation<br>
takes place utilizing channel estimates from filter 707.<br>
FIG. 8 is a flow chart showing operation of the receiver of FIG. 7. The<br>
logic flow begins at step 801 where the OFDM signal is received by OFDM<br>
receiver 701. As discussed above, the OFDM signal comprises a plurality of<br>
subcarriers, each having a pilot signal spread with a unique pilot code, and phase<br>
shifted an amount dependent upon a transmit antenna/subcarrier. A chip stream<br>
exits receiver 701 and simultaneously enters data despreader 703 and pilot<br>
despreader 709. At step 803 pilot despreader 709 despreads the chip stream to<br>
extract the pilot symbol stream, and at step 805 data despreader 703 despreads the<br>
chip stream with a particular Walsh code to extract data symbols. At step 807, the<br>
pilot symbol stream is Gain/Phase compensated. In particular the despread pilot<br>
symbol stream is multiplied by the complex conjugate of the phase adjustments<br>
505 for the desired transmitter in preparation for filtering via the<br>
filter 707.<br>
Continuing, the gain and phase compensated pilot signal is output to filter<br>
707 where filtering takes place (step 809). The resulting channel estimates are<br>
passed to demodulator 705 along with the despread data symbols, where the data<br>
symbols are coherently demodulated utilizing the channel estimates (step 811).<br>
In alternate embodiments of the invention, variations of FIG. 3 in terms of<br>
the spreading and the mapping of the spread symbols to the subcarrier / OFDM<br>
symbol grid are possible. In one alternate embodiment, the data symbols and pilot<br>
symbol(s) may be spread with differing spreading factors, preferably based on<br>
Orthogonal Variable Spreading Factor (OVSF) codes. For example in FIG. 3 the<br>
pilot chip stream could have a spreading factor of SF_pilot = 8, while the data<br>
could have a spreading factor of SF_data = 16. In this case the receive processing<br>
for the pilot channel is substantially similar to the preferred embodiment with<br>
reference to FIG. 3, but the data despreading would occur over two of the SF=8<br>
spreading blocks (such as b = 1 and b = 2 in FIG. 3). Therefore, this embodiment<br>
provides additional flexibility in selecting or even dynamically adjusting the<br>
spreading factor used for data. However, for this example note that the use of<br>
SF_pilot = 8 blocks the use of 2 out of the 16 codes from the data channel, as is<br>
known in the art for OVSF codes. In an additional example of this alternate<br>
embodiment, the spread data with a spreading factor of 16 can be mapped onto<br>
two different subcarriers to provide two-dimensional spreading on the data, which<br>
is known in the art to provide additional frequency diversity. In this example, 8<br>
chips of a 16 chip spreading block can be mapped to subcarrier k = 1 for spreading<br>
block interval b = 1, and the remaining 8 chips can be mapped to a different<br>
subcarrier (e.g., k = 2 for spreading block interval b = 1, k = 3 for spreading block<br>
b = 1 or b = 2, or various other combinations).<br>
Up to this point, the discussion has been primarily confined to the case<br>
where a pilot is spread with the same Walsh code on each of a plurality of<br>
transmitters, then phase shifted based on the transmitter/subcarrier combination<br>
and code multiplexed with user data. Then, a receiver can separate and estimate<br>
the channel between each transmitter and itself by despreading and further<br>
processing received signals in a way that takes advantage of the known phase<br>
variations of the transmitted pilot channels over multiple subcarriers. In an<br>
alternate embodiment, the invention can be used to estimate the channels between<br>
multiple transmitters and a receiver using the same spreading code on the pilot<br>
channel and by varying the phase of the pilot channels on a spreading block by<br>
block basis, based on the transmitter/block index. More particularly, each<br>
spreading block/antenna combination will share a similar pilot code on a<br>
particular subcarrier, except for the fact that the scrambled spread pilot signals<br>
will be phase shifted on some spreading block intervals of some antennas, based<br>
on the spreading block index/antenna combination, as exemplified by the<br>
following equation:<br><br>
where y is a parameter less than 1, as will be described below. Note that a<br>
practical limitation exists for this alternate embodiment as compared with the<br>
preferred embodiment. In the preferred embodiment, a receiver only needs to<br>
receive one spreading block (i.e., SF OFDM symbols) of data in the time<br>
dimension (with multiple subcarriers) before the multiple channels can be<br>
estimated. However, in this alternate embodiment, a receiver must receive a<br>
plurality of (and preferably a large number of) spreading blocks in the time<br>
dimension before the multiple channels can be estimated, leading to potentially<br>
significant received signal buffering requirements as well as delays in detecting<br>
the received data. The number of channels that can be estimated in this alternate<br>
embodiment depends on the maximum Doppler spread and the OFDM symbol<br>
duration. For a system with an OFDM symbol period of Ts' (including the cyclic<br>
prefix) and a maximum two-sided Doppler spread of less than ?/Ts' the alternate<br>
embodiment will accommodate up to 1/? transmitters (however, note that inter-<br>
subcarrier interference will begin to occur and affect the channel estimates if the<br>
Doppler spread is a significant fraction (e.g., 10%) of 1/Ts'). At the receiver,<br>
techniques similar to the ones described for the preferred embodiment can now be<br>
applied over multiple blocks in the time dimension (on each subcarrier containing<br>
a pilot) rather man over multiple subcarriers of one spreading block by<br>
exchanging the block index b for the subcarrier index k and Doppler spread for<br>
delay spread, all based on the duality principle between the time domain and the<br>
frequency domain. Also, since the delay and buffering issues can become<br>
significant for this alternate embodiment, it may be advantageous to reduce the<br>
block length by reducing the time spreading factor SF. It is even possible to use<br>
this alternate embodiment on a selected subset of subcarriers which do not use any<br>
spreading, in order to reduce the block length to the smallest possible size of 1<br>
OFDM symbol. Note that the number of subcarriers that can be configured in this<br>
will be limited by the allowable pilot overhead for the system. Nevertheless, it is<br>
expected that for typical Doppler spreads and OFDM system parameters, this<br>
embodiment would support a much larger number of transmitters than prior-art<br>
pilot tone based methods.<br>
While the invention has been particularly shown and described with<br>
reference to a particular embodiment, it will be understood by those skilled in the<br>
art that various changes in form and details may be made therein without<br>
departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. For example, although Walsh<br>
codes are used as an example of orthogonal spreading codes for multiplexing pilot<br>
and user data onto the same channel resources, one of ordinary skill in the art will<br>
recognize that other spreading codes, which are preferably orthogonal or have<br>
acceptably low cross correlation, can also be used. It is intended that such changes<br>
come within the scope of the following claims.<br>
