The invention relates to a method of recycling metallic coated scrap pieces, such as brazing sheet scrap pieces, by removing the coating layer from the core layer of the scrap pieces. The invention also relates to the use of a metallurgical vessel for this recycling method<br>
Below the invention will be elucidated for brazing sheet scrap, but the method can be used as well for other types of metallic coating layers on a metal core.<br>
During the production of brazing sheet a plate of an aluminium alloy having a relatively low Si content for the core of the brazing sheet is on one or both sides cJad by means of roll bonding with a plate of an aluminium alloy having a high Si content for the clad layer on the core. This sandwich of core plate and clad plate(s) is subsequently rolled so as to bind the clad Iayer(s) to the core layer and to produce the brazing sheet product having a thickness of typically between 0.2 and 3 mm, for use in the production of for instance heat exchangers for automobiles.<br>
During the production of the brazing sheet significant amounts of scrap is produced, for instance the beginnings and ends of the sandwich plates after each hot or cold rolling operation. Because the scrap contains both aluminium alloys with a high Si content and aluminium alloys with a low Si content, simple melting of the scrap would result in an aluminium airy having a raised Si content as compared to the Si content of the core, which is to high to be used for producing similar type core plates, unless diluted with substantial amounts of alloys having a very low Si content.<br>
Various methods are available to separate the clad alloy from the core alloy in the scrap. One of these methods is described in international application no. WO 00/67942. According to this method, the clad layer is separated from the core of the brazing sheet by heating the brazing sheet until the clad layer becomes liquid or semi-liquid but the core remains solid, and removing the clad layer by mechanical means such as a hand held or an automatically operated scraper. This method however is only suitable for individual pieces of about 50-75 mm thickness having a surface area per side of for instance 1 to 5 m3; sheet of about 3 mm is too thin.<br>
It is an object of the invention to provide an efficient method of recycling metallic coated scrap pieces, such as brazing sheet scrap, by removing the metallic coating from the core of the scrap pieces.<br><br>
It is another object of as prevention. to provide a method of recycling metallic coated scrap such as brazing sheet scrap, with which large amounts of scrap can be recycled.<br>
It is still another object of the invention to provide a method of recycling such scrap with which a wide range of sheet thicknesses can be recycled.<br>
It is yet another object of the invention to provide a method of recycle such scrap that is economical on an industrial scale.<br>
It is a further object of the invention to provide recycled core and coating alloys, which can easily be used for the production of new sheet material.<br>
According to a first aspect of the invention, one or more of these objects are reached with a method of recycling metallic coated scrap pieces of which the liquidus temperature of the coating layer is lower than the solidus temperature of the core layer, such as brazing sheet scrap pieces, or metallic coated scrap pieces of which the upper part of the melting range of the coating layer has an overlap with the lower part of the melting range of the core layer, by at least partially removing the coating layer from the core layer of the scrap pieces making use of a heat-resistant metallurgical vessel having an opening for introducing the scrap pieces into the vessel and exit means for dishrag essentially molten alloy, the vessel being rotatable around an axis of â– rotation, the method comprising the sequential steps of:<br>
filling the vessel with a load of scrap pieces;<br>
supplying an amount of energy to the vessel such that essentially all the scrap<br>
pieces reach a temperature above the solidus temperature of the coating layer,<br>
rotating the vessel during and/or after the supplying of the amount of energy<br>
for forming essentially molten alloy;<br>
removing the essentially molten alloy, having the composition of the coating<br>
layer of the scrap pieces mixed with small amounts of the core layer, through<br>
the exit means of the vessel;<br>
removing the remainder of the load from the vessel.<br>
Using this method, a certain amount of energy is introduced for a certain amount of scrap, which amount of energy is just enough to have the coating layer melted in whole or at least in part. This amount of energy should be introduced in a certain limited time period, to prevent oxidation, and to minimise diffusion of Si from the<br><br>
coating layer into the core layer when brazing sheet scrap pieces are recycled. Of course the amount of energy has to depend on the psrcentsge of the coating layer in the scrap pieces in relation to the total load. It is assumed that due to the rotation of the vessel, the scrap pieces abrade each other and thus remove the liquid or semi-liquid coating layer firom the core layer in a fast and efficient manner. It is believed that the combined effect of temperature and rotation results in a very efficient removal of the coating layer from the core, without the need for additional abrading means. It is unavoidable that small amounts of the core layer will be abraded as well, so the molten alloy will consist for a small part of the core alloy.<br>
Preferably, an amount of energy is supplied to the vessel such that essentially all the scrap pieces reach a temperature above the Uquidus temperature of the coating layer. By introducing such an amount of energy, essentially the whole coating layer will melt and be removed from the core. Due to the higher temperature it can be expected that the molten alloy wiU contain higher amounts of the cor&amp; alloy. Higher amounts of the core alloy could also be present because the hquidus temperature of the coating layer falls into the melting range of the core layer.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the method, the remainder of the load is removed from the vessel by supplying a second amount of energy in the vessel to melt the remainder of the load to form a second essentially molten alloy, preferably while the vessel is rotated, and removing the second essentially molten alloy having the composition of the core layer of the scrap pieces mixed with the remainder of the coating layer. When used for brazing sheet scrap, in this way two separate streams of essentially molten aluminium alloy are poured out of the vessel, a first one with a high Si content mainly originating from the clad layer of the brazing sheet scrap, and a second one with a relatively low Si content mainly originating from the core layer of the brazing sheet scrap. Pouring out the aluminium alloy is an easy way to remove the aluminium alloy from the vessel, and it can be formed directly into ingots or piglets. The same holds, mutatis mutandis, for other types of metallic coated scrap.<br>
Preferably, the inside Uning of the vessel has been preheated before the vessel is illed with the load of metallic coated scrap pieces, for the recycling of brazing sheet â– crap pieces preferably to a temperature of between 550Â° and 650" C and more ireferred to a temperature of between 600Â° and 630" C. In this way the vessel itself<br><br>
already can bs given the temperature necessary to melt the coacmg layer, and the energ}' introduced will be used to heat the scrap pieces and to melt the coating layer.<br>
According to a pref:;ned embodiment the vessel is idtable and the vessel is tilted to pour out the essentially molten alloy through the opening. The opening of the vessel thus acts as exit means too and no separate exit means are necessary in the vessel.<br>
Preferably, burning a fuel, preferably natural gas, with substantially pure oxygen, generates the energy in the vessel. By burning a fuel with substantially pure oxygen it is possible to supply a sufficient amount of energy in a very fast way, and using natural gas gives a very clean combustion, so the aluminium alloy will not be contaminated by for instance sulphur ftom liquid fuels.<br>
According to a prefeiTed embodiment of the method, the vessel is rotated during a time period after the amount of energy has been supplied and before the first molten alloy is removed. By using an ongoing period of rotation after the energy has been supplied, and before the first molten alloy is removed, it is assumed that a better energy distribution through the brazing sheet scrap is reached, resulting in a better removal of the clad layer firom the core layer.<br>
Preferably, a vessel is used having a useful volume of 3 - 20 m^, preferably of approximately 5 m^, which is rotated with a velocity of 0.2 - 10 ipm. For a vessel having such a volume, this rotational speed results in a good mixing and abrading of the brazing sheet scrap pieces.<br>
It has been found that the method according to the invention can be used in particular for recycling brazing sheet scrap pieces having a core layer of the AA 6xxx or AA 3xxx type aluminium alloy, such as AA 6063, AA 6060, AA 3003, AA 3103 or AA 3005, and a clad layer of the AA 4x7;jc type aluminium alloy, such as AA 4343, AA 4047, AA 4004, or AA 4104. For these types, the Si content of the core is up to 0.6% and the Si content of the clad layer is 6.8 to 13%,<br>
For the brazing sheet types mentioned above, the method according to the invention should preferably be used for scrap pieces having thicknesses of 0.2 to lOO mm, preferably approximately 0.5 - 15 mm and/or approximately 40 - 70 mm. The best results are obtained for thicker scrap, which is scrap having a thickness of about 5 -70 mm.<br><br>
Preferably the scrap pieces have a square surface area per side of up to 0.5 m^, preferably of 0.01 to 0.25 m^; the pieces thus having dimensions of approximately 10 to 50 cm. Scrap pieces with these dimensions mix well in the vessel, whereas too large dimensions may damage the lefractory lining of the vessel during rotation and too small pieces of scrap will presumably melt in total or stick together without an abrading effect.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the method, the vessel is preheated to a temperature of approximately 620Â° C, the vessel is filled with a load of 2 to 5 tons brazing sheet scrap pieces, and an amount of energy of 220 - 260 kilowatt-hour per ton brazing sheet scrap pieces, depending on the type and relative thickness of the clad layer, is supplied in the vessel before aluminitun alloy is removed from the vessel. Ttese data can be used for the brazing sheet types as mentioned above and result in a first amount of moltrai aluminium alloy having a Si content of alnMst half that of the original clad layar, of course part of the core layer of the scrap pieces is molten as well, especially at the edges of the scrap pieces. The remainder of the scrap will have a Si contrait that is higher than that of the original core layer, but far lower than a total mixture of clad and core layer. This is of course because it is impossible to remove the clad layer completely from the scrap pieces by melting and rotating.<br>
PrefCTably in the above method, the scrap pieces are heated during a time period of 20 to 50 minutes, preferably approximately 40 minutes. It has been found that a heating period of approximately 40 minutes, depending on the load of scrap pieces, is optimal for heating and removing the clad layer of the scrap pieces. It is not necessary to introduce an equal amount of energy per minute.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the method, a second amount of energy of 200 - 300 kilowatt-hour per ton of the remainder of the load is supplied in the vessel to melt the remainder of the load. The amount of energy added must of course be sufficient to melt all the remainder of the scrap; preferably the molten core is oveiiieated for further processing in the casthouse without former solidification.<br>
Preferably, the remainder of the load is heated during a time period of 20 to 40 minutes, preferably approximately 30 minutes. This is, depending on the original load, enough time to fully melt the core of the scrap pieces.<br><br>
Opuonaliy fluxing salts are added to the load of brazing sheet scrap pieces when filling the vessel. Such fluxing salts and their use are well known in the art.<br>
According to a second aspect of the invention, use is made of a heat-resistant vessel having an opening and means for introducing energy into the vessel, the vessel being rotatable around an axis of rotation, and the vessel being preferably tiltable so as to be able to empty the vessel through the opening, for performing the above described method for recycling metallic coated scrap pieces. Such vessels are already in use for processing aluminium-containing dross at a temperature of approximately 850Â° C. It has been found that such vessels can very well be used for performing the method according to the present invention. A particular suitable metallurgical vessel is given in European patent EP 0 627 014 or US patent no. 5.527.380, which documents are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
According to a third aspect of the invention, the core alloy and/or clad alloy as recovered from brazing sheet scrap pieces by using the method as described above provide an aluminium alloy having a composition which makes especially the core alloy suitable for use in the production of new brazing sheet. Moreover, the core alloy and clad alloy are produced in a cost-effective and fast manner.<br>
The invention also provides a product made from the core alloy and/or clad alloy as recovered by using the method as described above.<br>
The invention will be illustrated by the following non-limitative examples.<br>
