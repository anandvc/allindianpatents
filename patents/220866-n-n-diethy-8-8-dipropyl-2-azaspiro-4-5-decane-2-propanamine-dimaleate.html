				<td>This invention relates to an improved immunomodulatofy agent, the dimaleate salt of N,N-diethyl-8,8-dipropyl-2-azaspko[4.5]decarje-2-propanainine. The compound is represented by Structure I:<br>
(Structure Removed)<br>
The compound of this invention is useful as an immunorjnodulatory agent, particularly in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.<br>
Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
N,N-diethyl-8,8-dipropyl-2-azaspiro[4.5]decane-2-propanamine is a compound which is disclosed and claimed, along with pharmaceutically acceptable salts, hydrates and solvates thereof, as being useful as an immunomodulatory agent, particularly in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, in U.S. Patent No. 4,963,557, the entire disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference. Particularly preferred among the pharmaceutically acceptable salts described in U.S. Patent No. 4,963,557 and the only salt form prepared therein is the dihjdrqchloride sajj. N,N-diethyl-8,8-dipropyl-2-azaspiro[4.5]decane-2-propanamine (hereinafter Compound A) and the dihydrochloride salt of Compound A (N,N-diethyl-8,8-dipropyl-2-azaspiro[4.5]decane-2-propanamine dihydrochloride - hereinafter Compound B) can be prepared by methods such as described in U.S. Patent No. 4,963,557.<br>
It has now surprisingly been found that the dimaleate salt form of Compound A (N,N-diethyl-8,8-dipropyl-2-azaspiro[4.5]decane-z-propanamine dimaleate -hereinafter Compound C) has numerous advantages over the dihydrochloride. The dimaleate, while being as highly soluble as the dihydrochloride, is more stable when stored in bulk prior to manufacture, particularly prior to tableting. The dihydrochloride is hygroscopic and thus picks up moisture upon storage. The lessened tendency toward hygroscopicity of Compound C is very important because the accuracy of weighing out bulk compound for manufacturing and analytical purposes, particularly for tableting purposes, would be affected if the compound's<br>
weight is partially attributable to water of hydration. Thus, constant assaying would<br>
be required to ensure that the proper amount of active drug is provided. Dose<br>
accuracy is particularly critical since the drug is effective in small dosages.<br>
While Compound B is highly useful as an immunomodulatory agent,<br>
Compound C has the added advantages of ease of synthesis, lends itself to more<br>
accurate manufacturing procedures, particularly tableting procedures, and is far less<br>
hygroscopic which results in greater physical stability and greater ease of assaying<br>
drug content.<br>
The compound of this invention, Compound C, is useful as an<br>
immunomodulatory agent, particularly in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.<br>
Compound C (active ingredient) can be administered in a conventional dosage form<br>
prepared by combining Compound C with a conventional pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable carrier or diluent according to known techniques, such as those described<br>
in U.S. Patent No. 4,963,557. The route of administration may be oral, parenteral or<br>
topical. The term parenteral as used herein includes intravenous, intramuscular,<br>
subcutaneous, intranasal, intrarectal, intravaginal or intraperitoneal administration.<br>
The subcutaneous and intramuscular forms of parenteral administration are generally<br>
preferred. The daily oral dosage regimen will preferably be from about 0.01 to<br>
about 10 mg/kilogram of total body weight, most preferably from about 0.1 mg/kg to<br>
about 1 mg/kg. Preferably each oral dosage unit will contain the active ingredient in<br>
an amount of from about 0.1 mg to about 100 mg. The daily parenteral dosage<br>
regimen will preferably be from about 0.01 to about 10 mg per kilogram (kg) of total<br>
body weight, most preferably from about 0.1 to about 1 mg/kg. Preferably each<br>
parenteral dosage unit will contain the active ingredient in amount of from about 0.1<br>
mg to about 100 mg. The daily topical dosage regimen will preferably be from<br>
about 1 mg to about 100 mg per site of administration. The above dosages relate to<br>
the preferred amount of N,N-diethyl-8,8-dipropyl-2-azaspiro[4.5]decane-2-<br>
propanamine expressed as the free base. It will be recognized by one of skill in the<br>
art that the optimal quantity and spacing of individual dosages of Compound C will<br>
be determined by the nature and extent of the condition being treated, the form, route<br>
and site of administration, and the particular patient being treated, and that such<br>
optimums can be determined by conventional techniques. It will also be appreciated<br>
by one of skill in the art that the optimal course of treatment, i.e., the number of<br>
doses of Compound C given per day for a defined number of days, can be<br>
ascertained by those skilled in the art using conventional course of treatment<br>
determination tests.<br>
Generally speaking, the compound of this invention is prepared by dissolving<br>
the base, N,N-diethyl-8,8-dipropyl-2-azaspiro[4.5]decane-2-propanamine, in an<br>
appropriate organic solvent, such as deoxygenated ethyl acetate, with subsequent<br>
addition of two or more equivalents of maleic acid. The compound of this invention<br>
is filtered off and dried in vacuo or air dried at an elevated temperature.<br>
Maleic acid, 99%, is purchased from the Aldrich Chemical Company,<br>
Milwaukee, Wisconsin.<br>
The following examples further illustrate the present invention. The<br>
examples are not intended to limit the scope of the invention as defined hereinabove<br>
and as claimed below.<br>

crude oil containing residual solvent (89.1% by weight pure by HPLC analysis or<br>
408 g, 1.21 mol of pure compound) was placed in a 12 L, 3-necked glass vessel<br>
under positive nitrogen pressure and equipped with an air driven stirrer and<br>
dissolved in deoxygenated ethyl acetate (6.9 L). Maleic acid (281.9 g, 2.43 mol) was<br>
added to the vigorously stirring solution. The slurry was stirred at ambient<br>
temperature for 3 hours then a white solid was filtered off. The white solid was<br>

The present invention includes within its scope pharmaceutical compositions<br>
comprising Compound C, as the active ingredient, in association with a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable carrier of diluent. The compound of this invention can<br>
be administered by oral or parenteral routes of administration and can be formulated<br>
in dosage forms appropriate for each route of administration including capsules,<br>
tablets, pills, powders and granules. In such solid dosage forms, the active<br>
compound is admixed with at least one inert diluent such as sucrose, lactose or<br>
starch. The oral dosage forms can also comprise, as is normal practice, addition<br>
substances other than inert diluents, e.g., lubricating agents such as magnesium<br>
stearate, glidants such as colloidal silicone dioxide, antioxidants such as butylated<br>
hydizoxy toluene. In the case of capsules, tablets and pills, the dosage forms may<br>
also comprise buffering agents. Tablets and pills can additionally be prepared for a<br>
sustained release or may be prepared with enteric coatings.<br>
Preparations according to this invention for parenteral administration include<br>
sterile aqueous solutions although nonaqueous suspensions of emulsions can be<br>
employed. Such dosage forms may also contain adjuvants such as preserving,<br>
wetting, osmotic, buffering, emulsifying and dispersing agents. They may be<br>
sterilized by, for example, filtration through a bacteria retaining filter, by<br>
incorporating sterilizing agents into the compositions, irradiating the compositions<br>
or by heating the compositions.<br>
The following examples further illustrate the pharmaceutical compositions<br>
which are a feature of this invention.<br>
EXAMPLE 5<br>
Tablet Composition<br>
Lactose, microcrystalline cellulose, sodium starch glycolate, magnesium<br>
stearate and Compound C are blended in the proportions shown in Table 4 below.<br>
The blend is then compressed into tablets.<br>
