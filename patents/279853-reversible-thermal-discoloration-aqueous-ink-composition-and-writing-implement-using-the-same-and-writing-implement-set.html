REVERSIBLE THERMAL DISCOLORATION AQUEOUS INK COMPOSITION AND WRITING IMPLEMENT USING THE SAME AND WRITING IMPLEMENT SET<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a reversible thermal discoloration aqueous ink composition and a writing implement using the same and a writing implement set.<br>
Background Art<br>
Hitherto, there is disclosed an inner-wadding type writing implement wherein an ink occlusion body is impregnated with a reversible thermal discoloration aqueous ink composition capable of forming handwriting whose color tone changes depending on a change in temperature and is housed in a barrel (see, e.g., Patent Document 1) .<br>
The above reversible thermal discoloration aqueous ink composition solves a problem that a reversible thermal discoloration microcapsule pigment is gradually flocculated and precipitated in the ink occlusion body owing to a difference in specific gravity between the<br>
reversible thermal discoloration microcapsule pigment and a vehicle and hence handwriting is lightened or deepened in color depending on the state where a pen body is downward (an inverted state) or upward (an erecting state), and solves the problem by incorporating a water-soluble polymer flocculant into the ink to make the microcapsule pigment suspended in a loose flocculated state through a loose crosslinking action of the polymer flocculant.<br>
However, it is difficult to completely suppress the lightening and deepening in color of handwriting attributable to the difference in specific gravity between the microcapsule pigment and the vehicle merely by incorporating the polymer flocculant.  Particularly, it is desired to develop a means for preventing handwriting from lightening with time in an erecting state or from lightening induced by the application of vibration at transportation or at the time when it is carried on in an erecting state.<br>

Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
The coloring agent contained in the above reversible thermal discoloration aqueous ink composition is a reversible thermal discoloration microcapsule pigment including in a microcapsule a reversible thermal<br>
discoloration composition containing at least essential three components of (A) an electron donative coloring organic compound, (B) an electron accepting compound and (C) a reaction medium which determines a temperature at which color reactions of both compounds occur, the reversible thermal discoloration composition being decolored by heating.<br>
As the above reversible thermal discoloration composition, it discolors with a determined temperature (discoloration point) as a border; it shows a decolored state in a temperature region equal to or higher than the discoloration point at a high temperature side and a colored state in a temperature region equal to or lower than the discoloration point at a low temperature side; only one specified state of both states as mentioned above exists in an ordinary temperature region and the other state is maintained while a heat or cold necessary for expressing the state is applied but returns to the state shown in the ordinary temperature range when application of the heat or cold is removed; it has a property that a hysteresis width is relatively small (AH = 1 to 7°C), as described in JP-B-51-44706, JP-B-51-44707, JP-B-1-29398, and the like (see FIG. 1).<br>
Moreover, there can be applied a heat-decoloring type microcapsule pigments including in a microcapsule a<br>
reversible thermal discoloration composition which shows a large hysteresis characteristic (AHB = 8 to 50°C), as described in JP-B-4-17154, JP-A-7-179777, JP-A-7-33997, JP-A-8-39936 and the like, namely, in the discoloration, the shape of a curve plotting a change in color density with a temperature change traces a course which is largely different between the case where the temperature is elevated from a low temperature side of the discoloration temperature region and the case where the temperature is lowered from a high temperature side from the discoloration temperature region, and which has a color-memory property that a colored state in a low temperature region equal to or lower than the complete coloring temperature (t1) or a decolored state in a high temperature region equal to or higher than the complete decoloring temperature (t4) is maintained in a specified temperature region [a temperature region between t2 and t3 (a substantial two phase retention temperature region)] (see FIG. 2).<br>
Hysteresis characteristic in a color density-temperature curve of the above reversible thermal discoloration composition will be described in the following.<br>
In FIG. 2, the color density is plotted on the ordinate and the temperature on the abscissa.  A change<br>
in the color density due to a temperature change progresses along the arrow.  On this graph, A is a point showing the density at a temperature t4 at which a decolored state reaches a completely decolored state (hereinafter referred to as "complete decoloring temperature"), B is a point showing the density at a temperature t3 at which decoloring starts (hereinafter referred to as "decoloring starting temperature"), C is a point showing the density at a temperature t2 at which coloring starts (hereinafter referred to as "coloring starting temperature"), and D is a point showing the density at a temperature t1 at which a colored state reaches a completely colored state (hereinafter referred to as "complete coloring temperature").<br>
The discoloration temperature region is a temperature region between the aforementioned t1 and t4 wherein two phases of the colored state and decolored state can coexist, while the temperature region between t2 and t3 which has a large difference in the color density is a substantial discoloration temperature region.<br>
The length of the line segment EF is a measure showing contrast of discoloration, and the length of the line segment HG passing through a middle point of the line segment EF is a temperature width showing the degree of hysteresis (hereinafter referred to as "hysteresis<br>
width AH").  A small AH value allows the presence of only one state of the both states before and after discoloration in an ordinary temperature region.  A large AH value facilitates retention of each state before or after discoloration.<br>
As the above reversible thermal discoloration composition having a color-memory property, specifically, it can be effectively functioned for the retention of color shown at an ordinary state (daily life temperature region) by specifying the complete coloring temperature t1 to a temperature obtained only in a freezer, a cold district, and the like, i.e., a range of -50 to 0°C, preferably -40 to -5°C, more preferably -30 to -10°C and the complete decoloring temperature t4 to a temperature obtained from frictional heat generated with a frictional body or a familiar heating body such as a hair dryer, i.e., a range of 45 to 95°C, preferably 50 to 90°C, more preferably 60 to 80°C and specifying the AH value to 40 to 100°C.<br>

Though the ratio of the above components (A), (B) and (C) to be mixed depends on the concentration, discoloration temperature, discoloration mode and kind of each component, the component ratio at which desired discoloration characteristics can be generally obtained is in the range of 0.1 to 50, preferably 0.5 to 20 of the component (B), and in the range of 1 to 800, preferably from 5 to 200 of the component (C), based on 1 of the component (A) (each of the aforementioned ratios is<br>
expressed as part(s) by mass).<br>
In this regard, it is also possible to cause interchangeable color change from a color (1) to a color (2) by incorporating a coloring agent such as a non-thermochromic dyestuff or pigment into the above reversible thermal discoloration microcapsule pigment or ink.<br>
Examples of the microencapsulation method of the above reversible thermal discoloration composition include interfacial polymerization, interfacial polycondensation, in situ polymerization, submerged coat hardening, phase separation from an aqueous solution, phase separation from an organic solvent, melt dispersion cooling, aerial suspension coating and spray drying.  It can be selected as needed, depending on the using purpose. In addition, the microcapsules can be subjected to practical use by further giving durability and modifying surface characteristics in response to the object through the arrangement of a secondary resin coating on the surface.<br>
With regard to the form of the above microcapsule pigment, the application of a form having a round cross-section is not refused but a form having a non-round cross-section is effective.<br>
The handwriting formed by writing is densely<br>
arranged and fixed to a surface to be written with close contact of the above microcapsule pigment at the long diameter side (maximum outer diameter side) to show a high-density coloring characteristic.  Also, against an external force applied to the above handwriting by rubbing with a frictional body such as rubber, the above microcapsule pigment subtly undergoes elastic deformation into a shape relaxing the external force, the destroy of the wall membrane of the microcapsule was suppressed, and the thermal discoloration function thereof can be effectively expressed without impairing the function.<br>
It is preferred that the above microcapsule pigment having a non-round cross-section has an average value of the maximum outer diameter within the range of 0.5 to 5.0 µm, preferably 1 to 4 µm, more preferably 1 to 3 µm and satisfies the requirement that the ratio of the reversible thermal discoloration composition:wall membrane falls within the range of 7:1 to 1:1 (ratio by mass), preferably 6:1 to 1:1.<br>
When the average value of the maximum outer diameter exceeds 5.0 µm, decrease in effluence from capillary interstices tends to occur, while when the average value of the maximum outer diameter is less than 0.5 µm, a high-density coloring characteristic is hardly obtained.<br>
When the ratio of the reversible thermal discoloration composition to the wall membrane is larger than the above range, the wall membrane becomes too thin and hence decrease in durability against pressure and heat is apt to occur, while when the ratio of the wall membrane to the reversible thermal discoloration composition is larger than the above range, decrease in color density and sharpness tends to occur.<br>
The above reversible thermal discoloration microcapsule pigment may be incorporated to the total amount of the ink composition in an amount of 5 to 40% by mass, preferably 10 to 40% by mass, further preferably 10 to 30% by mass.<br>
When the amount is less than 5% by mass, the color density is insufficient, while when it exceeds 40% by mass, ink effluence decreases and hence writing performance is inhibited.<br>
As the medium to be used in the above ink, water and, if necessary, a water-soluble organic solvent are used.<br>
As the above water-soluble organic solvent, for example, ethanol, propanol, butanol, glycerin, sorbitol, triethanolamine, diethanolamine, monoethanolamine, ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, thiodiethylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, propylene glycol, butylene glycol,<br>
ethylene glycol monomethyl ether, ethylene glycol monoethyl ether, ethylene glycol monobutyl ether, diethylene glycol monomethyl ether, diethylene glycol monoethyl ether, diethylene glycol monobutyl ether, propylene glycol monobutyl ether, ethylene glycol monomethyl ether acetate, sulfolane, 2-pyrrolidone, N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone, or the like may be used.<br>
In this connection, since the specific gravity of the microcapsule pigment including a reversible thermal discoloration composition having a large hysteresis width generally exceeds 1, the water-soluble organic solvent having a specific gravity of more than 1.1 is preferably employed.<br>
By adding a water-soluble polymer flocculant into the above ink, the flocculant induces a loose crosslinking action between particles of the microcapsule pigment, thereby a loose flocculated state being shown. An ink showing such a loose flocculated state can suppress the separation of the microcapsule pigment.<br>
As the above polymer flocculant, a water-soluble polymer is used and examples thereof include polyvinylpyrrolidone, polyethylene oxide, and water-soluble polysaccharides.<br>
The above water-soluble polysaccharides include tragacanth gum, guar gum, pullulan, cyclodextrin, and<br>
water-soluble cellulose derivatives.  Specific examples of the water-soluble cellulose derivatives include methylcellulose, hydroxyethylcellulose,<br>
hydroxypropylcellulose, hydroxyethylmethylcellulose, and hydroxypropYlmethylcellulose.<br>
In the reversible thermal discoloration aqueous ink composition of the invention, all the water-soluble polymers can be employed so far as they show the loose croslinking action between the particles of the microcapsule pigment but, in particular, a water-soluble cellulose derivative effectively functions.<br>
In this connection, two or more kinds of the above polymer flocculants can be used in combination.<br>
By combined use of a comb-type polymer dispersant having a carboxyl group in the side chain and an organic nitrogen sulfur compound together with the above polymer flocculant, the dispersibility of a loose flocculate of the microcapsule pigment induced by the above polymer flocculant is improved.<br>
The comb-type polymer dispersant having a carboxyl group in the side chain is not particularly limited so far as it is a comb-type polymer compound having a plurality of carboxyl groups in the side chain but an acrylic polymer compound having a plurality of carboxyl groups in the side chain is preferred.  As the compound,<br>
trade name: Solsparse 43000 manufactured by Lubrizol<br>
Japan Ltd. can be mentioned as an example.<br>
The above organic nitrogen sulfur compound further<br>
suppresses the precipitation of the microcapsule pigment<br>
induced by vibration at the time when the ink composition<br>
is filled into a writing implement for practical use.<br>
This is because the compound further improves the<br>
dispersibility of dispersing the loose flocculate of the microcapsule pigment by the action of the comb-type polymer dispersant having a carboxyl group in the side<br>
chain.<br>
As the organic nitrogen sulfur compound, a compound selected from thiazole compounds, isothiazole compounds, benzothiazole compounds, and benzisothiazole compounds may be used.<br>
As the organic nitrogen sulfur compound, specifically, one or two or more compounds selected from 2-(4-thiazoyl)-benzimidazole (TBZ), 2-<br>
(thiocyanatomethylthio)-1,3-benzothiazole (TCMTB), 2-methyl-4-isothiazolin-3-one, and 5-chloro-2-methyl-4-isothiazolin-3-one may be used and preferably, one or two or more compounds selected from 2-(4-thiazoyl)-benzimidazole (TBZ), 2-methyl-4-isothiazolin-3-one, and 5-chloro-2-methyl-4-isothiazolin-3-one may be used. Examples of the above organic nitrogen sulfur<br>
compound may include trade names: Topside 88, 133, 170, 220, 228, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700Z, 800, and 950 manufactured by Parmachem Asia; and trade names: Hokustar HP and E50A, Hokuside P200, 6500, 7400, MC, 369, and R-150 manufactured by Hokko Sangyo Co., Ltd.<br>
In this connection, the mass ratio of the above comb-type polymer dispersant having a carboxyl group in the side chain to the organic nitrogen sulfur compound is from 1:1 to 1:10, preferably from 1:1 to 1:5.  When the ratio falls within the above range, the dispersibility of the loose flocculant of the microcapsule pigment and the suppression of precipitation of the microcapsule pigment induced by vibration can be sufficiently exhibited.<br>
The above water-soluble resin is added for imparting adhesiveness and viscosity to a paper surface and also has a function of enhancing the stability of the above comb-type polymer dispersant having a carboxyl group in the side chain and the organic nitrogen sulfur compound in the ink.<br>
Examples of the water-soluble resin include alkyd resins, acrylic resins, styrene-maleic acid copolymers, cellulose derivatives, polyvinylpyrrolidone, polyvinyl alcohol, and dextrin, and preferably, polyvinyl alcohol is used.<br>
Furthermore, as the polyvinyl alcohol, a partially<br>
saponified polyvinyl alcohol having a saponification degree of 70 to 89% by mol is more preferably used since it is rich in solubility even when the ink is in an acidic region.<br>
As for the amount of the above water-soluble resin, it is added into the ink in an amount ranging from 0.3 to 3.0% by mass, preferably 0.5 to 1.5% by mass.<br>
By controlling the pH of the above ink composition to 3 to 7, preferably 4 to 6, more preferably 5 to 6, the flocculation and precipitation of the contained reversible thermal discoloration microcapsule pigment in a low temperature region can be suppressed.<br>
When the pH exceeds 7, the ink effluence tends to be impaired at the time when the ink is allowed to stand in a low temperature region, i.e., a temperature region where the ink is frozen.  Also, when the pH is less than 3, the coloring characteristic of the reversible thermal discoloration aqueous ink composition included in the capsule is strengthened and hence there may arise a problem that a color remains at decoloring.<br>
The above ink composition is controlled in its surface tension within the range of 25 to 45 mN/m, preferably 30 to 45 mN/m, more preferably 30 to 40 mN/m.<br>
By controlling the surface tension within the above range, patchy touching at writing hardly occurs, the ink<br>
effluence is not impaired even when the composition is allowed to stand in a temperature region lower than 0°C where the ink is frozen or allowed to stand at a high temperature region, e.g., under an environment of 50°C, and unevenness in handwriting density and writing width depending on the storage environment and use environment hardly occurs.<br>
When the surface tension is less than 25 mN/m, the ink effluence tends to be unstable and the handwriting density becomes uneven.  Also, when the surface tension exceeds 45 mN/m, line braking tends to occur and also the ink effluence decreases under the storage environment and use environment described above, thereby decrease in handwriting density and unevenness in writing width being apt to occur.<br>
In addition, if necessary, there may be used antirusts such as benzotriazole, tolyltriazole, dicyclohexylammonium nitrite, diisopropylammonium nitrite, and saponin; wetting agents such as urea, nonionic surfactants, reduced or unreduced starch hydrolyzates, disaccharides including trehalose, oligosaccharides, sucrose, cyclodextrins, glucose, dextrins, sorbitol, mannitol, and sodium pyrophosphate; defoaming agents; fluorine-based surfactants and nonionic surfactants which improve permeability of the ink.<br>
As the pen body, a marking pen is suitable and a pen body such as a fiber tip, a felt tip, and a plastic tip may be mentioned.<br>
Moreover, a brush pen body or a ball-point pen body may be used.  Examples of the brush pen body include a fiber collective body in which fibers are closely bundled each other in a longitudinal direction, a plastic porous body having continuous voids, a thermally fused or resin processed body of a synthetic resin fiber, and an extrusion processed body of a soft resin or an elastomer.<br>
Examples of the ball-point pen include a pen in which a metal is cut to form a ball-receiving seat and an ink-effluent part, and a pen in which a plurality of inward protruded parts are provided at the inner surface near to one end of a metal pipe by external press deformation and ink-effluent gaps radially extending outward from the central part in a radial direction are formed between the individual above inward protruded parts.<br>
The ball held in the above ball-point pen is effectively a ball of a cemented carbide, a stainless steel, ruby, a ceramic, or the like, having an outer diameter of 0.3 to 2.0 mm, preferably 0.4 to 1.5 mm, more preferably 0.5 to 1.0 mm.<br>
In this connection, the above ball-point pen may<br>
have a constitution wherein a snapping member which snaps the rear part of the ball forward is provided so that the ball is pressed to the inner rim of front end of the pen body to be in a closely contacted state at non-writing and the ball is retracted by writing pressure to enable the effluence of the ink at writing.<br>
For the above barrel, a molded body composed of a thermoplastic resin such as polyethylene, polypropylene, polyethylene terephthalate, or Nylon is suitably employed.<br>
Moreover, as the structure of the writing implement containing the above ink composition, there may be mentioned a direct liquid type writing implement having a structure where a valve mechanism is provided in the barrel and the ink in the barrel is delivered to the pen body due to opening of the valve or a direct liquid type writing implement having a structure where the ink is directly contained inside the barrel and an ink flow-controlling member having comb-shape grooves or an ink flow-controlling member composed of a fiber bundle intervenes is contained therein.  However, suitable is an inner-wadding type writing implement having a structure where an ink occlusion body composed of a fiber bundle to be contained in the barrel is impregnated with the ink, a pen body is mounted on the writing front part, and the rear part of the pen body comes into contact with the ink<br>
occlusion body directly or via a connecting member.<br>
The above ink occlusion body is formed by bundling crimped fibers in a longitudinal direction and is constituted by placing the resulting fiber bundle in a cover body such as a plastic tube or a film and controlling the porosity to the range of about 40 to 90%. In this connection, the above fiber bundle body may be adhesion-processed by resin processing or heat-fusion processing, a plasticizer, or the like.<br>
The handwriting formed with a writing implement containing the above ink composition can be discolored by rubbing with a finger or application of a heating implement or a cooling implement.<br>
Examples of the above heating tool include a conducting thermal discoloration implement equipped with a resistor heating body, a heating discoloration implement filled with hot water or the like, and application of hair drier.  Preferably, a frictional member or a frictional body capable of discoloration by a conventional method may be used.<br>
The above frictional member or frictional body is<br>
suitably an elastic body such as an elastomer or a<br>
plastic foam rich in elastic feeling and capable of<br>
generating appropriate friction at rubbing to produce<br>
frictional heat	but may be a plastic molded<br>
body, a stone, a wood, a metal, or a fabric.<br>
In this connection, the handwriting can be rubbed by means of a gum eraser but, since bits of the eraser are generated at rubbing, the frictional member as mentioned above is preferably used.<br>
As materials for the above frictional member or frictional body, a silicone resin or an SEBS resin (styrene-ethylene-butadiene-styrene block copolymer) is suitably used but the SEBS resin is more suitably used since the silicone resin tends to adhere to the portion erased with rubbing and the handwriting tends to be repelled at repeated writing.<br>
The above frictional member may be a member (frictional body) having any shape separated from the writing implement but its fixation to the writing implement results in excellent portability.<br>
The portion to which the above frictional member is fixed may be a cap front part (apex part) or a barrel rear part (portion on which a writing tip is not mounted).<br>
Furthermore, it is also possible to provide a small protruded portion having any shape at a part of the cap or a part of the barrel to be a frictional member.<br>
Examples of the cooling implement include a cooling discoloration implement utilizing a Peltier element, a cooling discoloration implement filled with a coolant<br>
such as cold water or ice chips, and application of a refrigerator or freezer.<br>
In addition, a writing implement set can also obtained by combining the above writing implement and frictional body.<br>
Examples<br>
The following will illustrate the reversible thermal discoloration aqueous ink compositions for writing implements of the invention and writing implements using the same but the invention is not limited thereto.<br>
In this connection, the term "part(s)" in Examples means part(s) by weight.<br>
The surface tension of the ink was measured by automatic surface tensiometer (CBVP-A3) manufactured by Kyowa Interface Science Co., Ltd.<br>
