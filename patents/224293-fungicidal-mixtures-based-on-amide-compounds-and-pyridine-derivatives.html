and  W is 0,   S or S=0.<br>
The amide compounds of the formula I are known per se and described in the literature (EP-A 545 099).<br>
WO 97/08952 describes fungicidal mixtures which, in addition to compounds of the formula I, contain fenazaquin as further components. These mixtures are described as being very effective against Botrytis.<br>
Also known are the dithiocarbamates II (Ila: common name:<br>
mancozeb, US-A 3,379,610; lib: common name: maneb, US-A<br>
2,504,404; lie: former common name: metiram, US-A 3,248,400; lid:<br>
common<br>
name: zineb, US-A 2,457,674), their preparation and their action<br>
against harmful fungi.<br>
Also known is the compound III, its preparation and its use (German Laid-open Application DOS 15 67 169,  common name: propamocarb).<br>
Synergistic mixtures of the compounds IV with dithiocarbamates, their preparation and their action against harmful fungi are cnown from EP-A 753 258 and US-A 5,304,572.<br><br>
The compounds V are described in the literature as fungicides and insecticides (for example DE 24 63 046 and the literature cited therein). A known representative of this class of active ingredients is commercially available under the common name fosetyl or fosetyl-Al.<br>
The compound VI is known under the proposed common name famoxa-done (Proc. Brighton Crop Protection Conference 1996, Pests and Diseases, pages 21-26).<br>
Compounds of the formula VII are known, inter alia, from EP-A 551,048 and EP-A 629,616.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide mixtures which have an improved activity against harmful fungi combined with a reduced total amount of active ingredients applied (synergistic mixtures), with a view to reducing the application rates and to improving the activity spectrum of the known compounds.<br>
We have found that this object is achieved by the mixtures defined at the outset. Moreover, we have found that better control of harmful fungi is possible by applying the compounds I and the compounds II to V simultaneously, that is either together or separately, or by applying the compounds I and the compounds II to V in succession than when the compounds I or II to V are applied on their own.<br>
The mixtures according to the invention have synergistic action and are therefore particularly suitable for controlling harmful fungi and in particular mildew on grapevines.<br>

Particularly preferred compounds VII are those in which R23 is Ci-C6-alkyl (in particular methyl, ethyl or propyl), Ci-C6-haloalkyl or phenyl, R24 is Ci-C6-alkyl (preferably methyl), Ci-C6-alkylthio (preferably methylthio), R25 is phenyl, unsubstituted or substituted by Ci-Cj-alkyl, halogen, nitro, Ci-C4-alkoxy, Ci-C4-alkylcarbonyl, pyridyl, furyl, thienyl, thiazolyl, thienyl or naphthyl, unsubstituted or substituted by Ci-C4-alkyl, and R26 is hydrogen or Ci-C6-alkyl.<br>
To unfold the synergistic activity, even a small amount of the amide compound of the formula I is sufficient. Preference is given to employing amide compound and active ingredient of the formula II and/or III to V in a weight ratio in the range of from 50:1 to 1:50, in particular from 10:1 to 1:10. It is also possible here to employ ternary mixtures or mixtures having more than three active components which, in addition to amide compounds I, comprise both compounds II and compounds III, IV and/or V. In such mixtures, the mixing ratio of the compounds II, III, IV and V with each other is usually in the range of from 50:1 to 1:50, preferably from 10:1 to 1:10.<br>
Owing to the basic character of their nitrogen atoms, the compounds IV are capable of forming salts or adducts with inorganic or organic acids or with metal ions.<br>
Examples of inorganic acids are hydrohalic acids such as hydrofluoric acid, hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid and hydriodic acid, and furthermore carbonic acid, sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid and nitric acid.<br>
Suitable organic acids are, for example, formic acid and alkanoic acids, such as acetic acid, trifluoroacetic acid, trichloroacetic acid and propionic acid, and also glycolic acid, thiocyanic acid, lactic acid, succinic acid, citric acid, benzoic acid, cinnamic acid, oxalic acid, alkylsulfonic acids (sulfonic acids having<br><br>
straight-chain or branched alkyl radicals of 1 to 20 carbon atoms), arylsulfonic acids or aryldisulfonic acids (aromatic radicals, such as phenyl and naphthyl, which carry one or two sulfo groups), alkylphosphonic acids (phosphonic acids having straight-chain or branched alkyl radicals of 1 to 20 carbon atoms), arylphosphonic acids or aryldiphosphonic acids (aromatic radicals, such as phenyl and naphthyl, which carry one or two phosphonic acid radicals), it being possible for the alkyl or aryl radicals to carry further substituents, e.g. p-toluenesulfonic acid, salicylic acid, p-aminosalicylic acid, 2-phenoxybenzoic acid, 2-acetoxybenzoic acid, etc.<br>
Suitable metal ions are, in particular, the ions of the elements of the first to eighth subgroup, in particular chromium, manganese, iron, cobalt, nickel, copper, zinc and furthermore of the second main group, in particular calcium and magnesium, and of the third and fourth main group, in particular aluminum, tin and lead. The metals can exist in the various valencies which they can assume.<br>
When preparing the mixtures, it is preferred to employ the pure active ingredients I and II to V, to which further active ingredients against harmful fungi or other pests, such as insects, arachnids or nematodes, or else herbicidal or growth-regulating active ingredients or fertilizers can be admixed.<br>
The mixtures of the compounds I and II and/or III and/or IV and/or V, or the compounds I and II and/or III and/or IV and/or V used simultaneously, jointly or separately, exhibit outstanding activity against a wide range of phytopathogenic fungi, in particular from the classes of the Ascomycetes, Basidiomycetes, Phycomycetes and Deuteromycetes. Some of them act systemically and can therefore be employed as foliar- and soil-acting fungicides.<br>
They are especially important for controlling a large number of fungi in a variety of crop plants, such as cotton, vegetable species (e.g. cucumbers, beans, tomatoes, potatoes and cucurbits), barley, grass, oats, bananas, coffee, maize, fruit species, rice, rye, soya, grapevine, wheat, ornamentals, sugar cane, and a variety of seeds.<br>
They are particularly suitable for controlling the following phytopathogenic fungi: Erysiphe graminis (powdery mildew) in cereals, Erysiphe cichoracearum and Sphaerotheca fuliginea in<br><br>
cucurbits, Podosphaera leucotricha in apples, Uncinula necator in grapevines, Puccinia species in cereals, Rhizoctonia species in cotton, rice and lawns, Ustilago species in cereals and sugar cane, Venturia inaequalis (scab) in apples, Helminthosporium<br>
i species in cereals, Septoria nodorum in wheat, Botrytis cinerea (gray mold) in strawberries, vegetables, ornamentals and grape-vines, Cercospora arachidicola in groundnuts, Pseudocercosporella herpotrichoides in wheat and barley, Pyricularia oryzae in rice, Phytophthora infestans in potatoes<br>
i and tomatoes, Plasmopara viticola in grapevines, Pseudoperonospora species in hops and cucumbers, Alternaria species in vegetables and fruit, Mycosphaerella species in bananas and Fusarium and Verticillium species.<br>
Particularly preferably, the mixtures according to the invention can be used for controlling mildew in crops of cereals and grapevines.<br>
The compounds II and/or III to VII can be applied simultaneously, either jointly or separately, or in succession, the sequence, in the case of separate application, generally not having any effect on the result of the control measures.<br>
Depending on the kind of effect desired, the application rates of the mixtures according to the invention are, in particular in agricultural crop areas, from 0.01 to 8 kg/ha, preferably 0.1 to 5 kg/ha, in particular 0.5 to 3.0 kg/ha.<br>
The application rates of the compounds I are from 0.01 to 2.5 kg/ha, preferably 0.05 to 2.5 kg/ha, in particular 0.1 to 1.0 kg/ha.<br>
Correspondingly, in the case of the compounds II and/or III and/or IV and/or V and/or VI and/or VII, the application rates are from 0.01 to 10 kg/ha, preferably 0.05 to 5 kg/ha, in particular 0.05 to 2.0 kg/ha.<br>
For seed treatment, the application rates of the mixture are generally from 0.001 to 250 g/kg of seed, preferably 0.01 to 100 g/kg, in particular 0.01 to 50 g/kg.<br>
If phytopathogenic harmful fungi are to be controlled, the separate or joint application of the compounds I and II and/or III and/or IV and/or V and/or VI and/or VII or of the mixtures of the compounds I and II and/or III and/or IV and/or V and/or VI<br><br>
and/or VII is effected by spraying or dusting the seeds, the plants or the soils before or after sowing of the plants, or before or after plant emergence.<br>
The fungicidal synergistic mixtures according to the invention, or the compounds I and II and/or III and/or IV and/or V and/or VI and/or VII, can be formulated for example in the form of ready-to-spray solutions, powders and suspensions or in the form of highly concentrated aqueous oily or other suspensions, dispersions, emulsions, oil dispersions, pastes, dusts, materials for broadcasting or granules, and applied by spraying, atomizing, dusting, broadcasting or watering. The use form depends on the intended purpose; in any case, it should ensure as fine and uniform a distribution as possible of the mixture according to the invention.<br>
The formulations are prepared in a known manner, e.g. by extending the active ingredient with solvents and/or carriers, if desired using emulsifiers and dispersants, it being possible also to use other organic solvents as auxiliary solvents if water is used as the diluent. Suitable auxiliaries for this purpose are essentially: solvents such as aromatics (e.g. xylene), chlorin-ated aromatics (e.g. chlorobenzenes), paraffins (e.g. mineral oil fractions), alcohols (e.g. methanol, butanol), ketones (e.g. cyclohexanone), amines (e.g. ethanolamine, dimethylformamide) and water; carriers such as ground natural minerals (e.g. kaolins, clays, talc, chalk) and ground synthetic minerals (e.g. finely divided silica, silicates); emulsifiers such as nonionic and anionic emulsifiers (e.g. polyoxyethylene fatty alcohol ethers, alkylsulfonates and arylsulfonates) and dispersants such as lignosulfite waste liquors and methylcellulose.<br>
Suitable surfactants are the alkali metal salts, alkaline earth metal salts and ammonium salts of aromatic sulfonic acids, e.g. ligno-, phenol-, naphthalene- and dibutylnaphthalenesulfonic acid, and of fatty acids, alkyl- and alkylarylsulfonates, alkyl, lauryl ether and fatty alcohol sulfates, and salts of sulfated tiexa-, hepta- and octadecanols, or of fatty alcohol glycol 2thers, condensates of sulfonated naphthalene and its derivatives tfith formaldehyde, condensates of naphthalene or of the laphthalenesulfonic acids with phenol and formaldehyde, polyoxyethylene octylphenol ether, ethoxylated isooctyl-, octyl-or  nonylphenol, alkylphenol polyglycol ethers, tributylphenyl polyglycol ethers, alkylaryl polyether alcohols, isotridecyl alcohol, fatty alcohol/ethylene oxide condensates, ethoxylated<br><br>
castor oil, polyoxyethylene alkyl ethers or polyoxypropylene alkyl ethers, lauryl alcohol polyglycol ether acetate, sorbitol esters, lignosulfite waste liquors or methylcellulose.<br>
Powders, materials for broadcasting and dusts can be prepared by mixing or jointly grinding the compounds I or II and/or III and/or IV and/or V and/or VI and/or VII, or the mixture of the compounds I and II and/or III and/or IV and/or V and/or VI and/or VII, with a solid carrier.<br>
Granules (e.g. coated granules, impregnated granules or homogeneous granules) are usually prepared by binding the active ingredient, or active ingredients, to a solid carrier.<br>
Fillers or solid carriers are, for example, mineral earths, such as silicas, silica gels, silicates, talc, kaolin, limestone, lime, chalk, bole, loess, clay, dolomite, diatomaceous earth, calcium sulfate, magnesium sulfate, magnesium oxide, ground synthetic materials and fertilizers, such as ammonium sulfate, ammonium phosphate, ammonium nitrate, ureas, and products of vege¬table origin, such as cereal meal, tree bark meal, wood meal and nutshell meal, cellulose powders or other solid carriers.<br>
The formulations generally comprise from 0.1 to 95% by weight, preferably 0.5 to 90% by weight, of one of the compounds I or II and/or III and/or IV and/or V and/or VI and/or VII or of the mixture of the compounds I and II and/or III and/or IV and/or V and/or VI and/or VII. The active ingredients are employed in a purity of from 90% to 100%, preferably 95% to 100% (according to NMR spectrum or HPLC).<br>
The compounds I and II and/or III and/or IV and/or V and/or VI and/or VII, the mixtures, or the corresponding formulations, are applied by treating the harmful fungi, their habitat, or the plants, seeds, soils, areas, materials or spaces to be kept free from them with a fungicidally effective amount of the mixture, or of the compounds I and II and/or III and/or IV and/or V and/or VI and/or VII in the case of separate application.<br>

Use Example<br>
The synergistic activity of the mixtures according to the invention can be demonstrated by the following experiments:<br>
The active ingredients, separately or jointly, are formulated as a 10% emulsion in a mixture of 63% by weight of cyclohexanone and 27% by weight of emulsifier, and diluted with water to the desired concentration.<br>
Evaluation is carried out by determining the infected leaf areas in percent. These percentages are converted into efficacies. The efficacy (H) is calculated as follows using Abbot's formula:<br><br>
a  corresponds to the fungal infection of the treated plants in % and<br>
P   corresponds to the fungal infection of the untreated (control) plants in %<br>
An efficacy of 0 means that the infection level of the treated plants corresponds to that of the untreated control plants; an efficacy of 100 means that the treated plants were not infected.<br>
The expected efficacies of the mixtures of the active ingredients were determined using Colby's formula [R.S. Colby, Weeds 15. 20-22 (1967)] and compared with the observed efficacies.<br><br>
E expected efficacy, expressed in % of the untreated control, when using the mixture of the active ingredients A and B at the concentrations a and b<br>
x   efficacy, expressed in % of the untreated control, when using active ingredient A at a concentration of a<br><br>
y  efficacy, expressed in % of the untreated control, when using active ingredient B at a concentration of b<br>
Use Example 1 - Activity against Phytophthora infestans on tomatoes<br>
Leaves of potted plants of variety "Grofle Fleischtomate" were sprayed to runoff point with an aqueous suspension which had been prepared from a stock solution comprising 10% of active compound, 63% of cyclohexanone and 27% of emulsifier. The next day, the leves were infected with an aqueous zoospore suspension of Phytophthora infestans. The plants were subsequently placed in a chamber saturated with water vapor, at temperatures between 16 and 18°C. After 6 days, the tomato blight on the untreated but infected control plants had developed to such an extent that the infection could be determined visually in %.<br>
The compounds of the formula I employed were the following components:<br><br><br><br>
The test results show that the observed efficacy in all mixing ratios is higher than the efficacy which had been calculated beforehand using Colby's formula.<br><br><br><br>
