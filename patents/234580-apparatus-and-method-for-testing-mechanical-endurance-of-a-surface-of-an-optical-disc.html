				<td>APPARATUS AND METHOD FOR TESTING MECHANICAL ENDURANCE OF A SURFACE OF AN OPTICAL DISC<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to an apparatus and method for testing quality of an optical disc, and more particularly, to an apparatus method for testing quality of mechanical endurance of a surface of an optical disc.<br>
Background Art<br>
Up to now, there are recording media such as a magnetic recording tape, a laser disc (LD) or a compact disc (CD) as an optical disc, and a digital video disc (DVD) newly born with a vast recording capacity.<br>
Since the optical disc among the recording media utilizes a digital recording system different from the conventional recording system, that is, magnetic recording system, and has a very small volume and weight so that it is efficient and convenient to keep and carry, it is a recent trend for a consumer to prefer the optical disc.<br>
However, even any appliance should be used without any defect, and if there were any problem in quality, then the consumer's reliability for the manufacturer would be decreased.<br>
This causes more serious problem in the optical disc having minute signal characteristics and brings inferior quality originated from the error of thickness of a disc, scratch, deformity, fingerprint, and attachment of foreign material during manufacturing of the product.<br>
Thus, a produced optical disc undergoes the quality test as a next process,<br>
and the optical disc is shipped to an optical disc market.<br>
A conventional quality test for an optical disc is generally performed by four measuring drives.<br>
First, under the assumption that characteristics of optical discs manufactured by the same equipment are identical, the manufacturer makes a choice of an arbitrary optical disc from all of the manufactured optical discs and loads the selected optical disc onto a measuring system.<br>
In the first measuring drive, a high frequency wave signal and a jitter are measured by means of a signal reproduced from the optical disc.<br>
In the second measuring drive, a servo signal (a focusing error signal and a tracking error signal) are measured based on a signal reproduced from the optical disc.<br>
In the third measuring drive, the mechanical characteristics of the optical disc, which undergoes the quality test, are measured.<br>
Finally, in the fourth measuring drive, the optical characteristics of the optical disc are measured.<br>
As described above, according to the conventional test, an accuracy of information recording, and the mechanical characteristics and an optical characteristics of the optical disc arc inspected.<br>
From these, since a mechanical damage that would occur on an incident surface of an information recording/reproducing laser beam during the use of an high density optical disc, that is, a scratch and the like causes the deterioration of a signal of an optical disc as well as data loss, and in more worse case, brings the recording and/or reproducing of information onto the optical disc impossible, the damage takes the most important portion of the quality test of the optical disc.<br>
Therefor, to prevent this, a protective coating may be formed to enhance the mechanical stiffness or hardness of the surface of the optical disc.<br>
However, after forming the protective coating on the disc surface for this purpose, the mechanical characteristics of the protective coating should be quantized. Namely, there is need to quantize for how long the protective coating endure the scratch which would occur during the use of the optical disc.<br>
There are a pencil hardness test and a taber abrasion test as a test for the quantization of surface-proof of the high-density optical disc.<br>
The pencil hardness test is an estimating method for estimating the scratch at a hardness value corresponding a hardness of the pencil at an instant when the scratch occurs by contacting pencils of which different hardness to the optical disc in a rectilinear motion.<br>
However, the pencil hardness test is a test for generating the scratch by which a human contacts the pencil on the surface of the optical disc, has disadvantages that it is difficult not only to maintain same load continuously, but also to generate the quantization scratch because the scratch does not occur as many as desired.<br>
The taber abrasion test is a test to estimate degree of endurance by uniformly wearing the surface of the optical disc while giving a predetermined load by means of D1004 method of a standard, American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) as a kind of an abrasion wheel.<br>
In the conventional taber abrasion testing apparatus, if an optical disc to be scratched is loaded and rotated, a plurality of abrasion wheels having a predetermined weight contact the optical disc at a perpendicular position to the optical disc so that scratch the surface of the optical disc by a uniform load for at least more ten rotation of the optical disc.<br>
At that time, the ASTM defines the load generated from the abrasion wheel less than 9.8N (lOOO gf), and there are several kinds such as CS-10F, CS-10, and CS-17 to be used.<br>
The taber abrasion testing apparatus as described above is an equipment designed for the purpose of not testing the mechanical endurance of the surface of the optical disc by scratching the optical disc, but testing a degree of the scratch of general plastic goods.<br>
Therefore, the scratch occurring by the taber abrasion testing apparatus is remarkably different from the scratch generated when the optical disc is used actually in real life.<br>
Namely, the taber abrasion testing apparatus determines the endurance of the surface of the optical disc by wearing the surface. This is remarkably different from the situation that real-generated scratch is reacted in a drive (for example, an optical disc drive) for driving the optical disc by responding the operation.<br>
Therefore, since the manufacturer determines the quality of the optical disc by his relative determination with his veteran know-how not quantitative classification according to an actual reference standard when to determine the quality of the optical disc poor or good by the taber abrasion testing apparatus, there are a plenty of errors. Moreover, since the scratches generated on the optical disc in real life and by the taber abrasion testing apparatus are different from each other in the shape, a try to determine the optical disc poor or good with only the know-how without absolute reference value makes vast of errors.<br>
As described above, since, up to now, there is not a special method for quantizing generation degree of the scratch in order to test the mechanical endurance of the surface of the optical disc, a quantization of the degree of the scratch is urgently demanded.<br>

FIG. 1 illustrates a schematic view showing a taber abrasion testing apparatus according to the present invention.<br>
As illustrated in FIG. 1, an apparatus for testing mechanical endurance of a surface of an optical disc includes a rotating plate 20, on which an optical disc 30 to be scratched is loaded, for rotating the loaded optical disc 30, and a plurality of abrasion wheels 10, disposed at a perpendicular to the rotating plate 20, for contacting the optical disc 30 and generating the scratch, the scratch being generated when the optical disc 30 rotates under 5 turns for the abrasion wheels 10 apply a predetermined load on the optical disc 30.<br>
Meanwhile, the abrasion wheels are selected from any one of CS-10F, CS-10, and CS-17.<br>
Hereinafter, the testing method of the mechanical endurance of the surface of the optical disc of the present invention by reference with the accompanying drawings.<br>
FIG. 2 illustrates a flowchart showing a method of testing mechanical endurance of a surface of an optical disc according to the present invention.<br>
As shown in FIG. 2, first, the optical disc 30 is fixed on the rotating plate 20, and then the rotating plate 20 rotates together the optical disc (Step S10).<br>
Next, the abrasion wheels 10 contact the optical disc 30 being rotated at an<br>
upper end in a normal motion (Step S20).<br>
The predetermined load is applied on the optical disc 30 in normal direction according to the scratch test so that the contacting load between the optical disc 30 and the abrasion wheels 10 is increased (Step S30).<br>
After maintaining the contacting load between the optical disc 30 and the abrasion wheels 10 as many as the predetermined turns of the optical disc 30, the abrasion wheels 10 are moved in the normal direction so that the abrasion wheels are departed from the optical disc 30 (Step S40).<br>
As described above, on the surface of the optical disc 30 being rotated, the predetermined load and the abrasion wheels 10 contacting the optical disc 30 based on the predetermined turns cause the generation of a predetermined scratch pattern on the surface of the optical disc 30 as illustrated in FIG. 2.<br>
As illustrated in FIG. 3, by using the taber abrasion tester according to the present invention, the predetermined scratch pattern is generated on the surface of the optical disc 30, so that the depth of the scratch can be obtained.<br>
FIG. 4 illustrates a graph showing experimental values of the scratch depth generated according to pressure applied on the optical disc 30 according to the present invention. Here, a bare disc without a coating layer and a hard-coated disc are used as experimental materials.<br>
In the experiment as illustrated in FIG. 4, if the scratch with depth deeper than 2um is generated, it is measure that a servo error is generated when a dynamic characteristics of the optical disc 30 is estimated.<br>
Namely, when the endurance test of the surface of the optical disc 30 is performed, the 2µm is defined as the absolute reference value for determining whether the optical disc 30 is poor or good, and by finding a still wool test condition causing the scratch depth of 2µm, the mechanical endurance of the surface of the optical disc 30 under the condition so that the generation degree of<br>
the scratch is quantized.<br>
FIG. 5 is a graph explaining a method of testing mechanical endurance of a surface of an optical disc according to the present invention, and represents a graph as the depth of the scratch generated on the optical disc 30 by the load applied to kind of abrasion wheel such as CS-10F, CS-10, and CS-17.<br>
As illustrated in FIG. 5, the load generated from the abrasion wheels 10 is quantized to 0.5N (50gf) to 16.2N (1650gf), and is differently set according to kind of the abrasion wheels.<br>
Namely, in the taber abrasion test, under the condition of using the CS-10F as the abrasion wheel 10 and rotating the optical disc 30 only one turn, it is understood that the load generating the scratch depth of 2µm ranges 0.5N (50gf) lo 2.5N (250gf), preferably 1.5N (150gf).<br>
Under the condition of using the CS-10 as the abrasion wheel 10 and rotating the optical disc 30 only one turn, it is understood that the load generating the scratch depth of 2µm ranges 6.4N (650gf) to 8.3N (850gf), more preferably 7.4N (750gf).<br>
Moreover, under the condition of using the CS-17 as the abrasion wheel 10 and rotating the optical disc 30 only one turn, it is understood that the load generating the scratch depth of 2µm ranges 11.8N (1200gf) to 13.7N (1400gf), more preferably 13.2N (1350gf).<br>
Therefore, if the abrasion wheel 10 were soft one, namely, CS-10F, the load of the surface of the optical disc 30 is quantized to 0.5N (50gf) to 2.5N (250gf), more preferably quantized to 1.5N (150gf), if the abrasion wheel 10 were middle one, namely, CS-10, the load of the surface of the optical disc 30 is quntized to 6.4N (650gf) to 8.3N (850gf), more preferably quantized to 7.4N (750gf), and if the abrasion wheel 10 were hard one, namely, CS-17, the load of the surface of the optical disc 30 is quntized to 11.8N (1200gf) to 13.7N (1400gf), more preferably<br>
quantized to 13.2N (1350gf).<br>
The contacting load between the optical disc 30 and the abrasion wheel 10 is maintained to a corresponding load in proportion to numbers of the turn of the optical disc according to quantized condition so that the scratch is generated on the optical disc 30.<br>
At that time, by, reducing the abrasion degree of the optical disc 30 due to the abrasion wheel 10 at minimum by decreasing the number of the turn of the optical disc 30 to under 5 turns, the scratch very closer to the scratch to be generated in an actual life so that the reliability of test for the mechanical endurance of the surface of the optical disc 30 can be enhanced.<br>
In other words, the scratch on the optical disc 20 in the real life is generated by being scratched few times, on the contrary, the more times the abrasion wheels 10 are scratched, the more the scratch during several rotation of the optical disc 30 by using the taber abrasion tester makes a difference from the scratch in real life due to abrasion of ambient optical disc to be scratched.<br>
With this reason, there is a problem in the reliability for the mechanical endurance test of the surface of the optical disc due to the scratch, and then this is the worst serious problem occurring in the mechanical endurance test of the surface of the optical disc according to the conventional art.<br>
According to the present invention, since the number of turns of the optical disc can be reduced to 1 turn at minimum to 5 turns at maximum value by the quantized-absolute reference value, the reliability of the mechanical endurance test of the surface of the optical disc can be enhanced by causing the scratch of type the closest the scratch hi real life.<br>
As described above, just during one turn of the optical disc, after generating the scratch by using the load condition 0.5N (50gf) to 16.2N (1650gf) causing the scratch with a depth of 2µm, the endurance is to be tested through the scratch generated on the surface of the optical disc 30 by separating the scratched disc 30 from the rotating plate 20. Next, the optical disc 30 is determined to be poor or good (Step S50).<br>
After this, other optical disc to be tested is loaded on the rotating plate 20, the testing operations as described above are repeated so that a plenty of optical discs are determined to, be poor or good. <br>
Industrial applicability<br>
As described above, the apparatus for testing the mechanical endurance of the surface of the optical disc and the method performed the apparatus have following advantages.<br>
First, the generation degree of the scratch is quantized to enhance the mechanical characteristics of the surface so that the preservation of data according to achievement for the high-density of the optical disc can be increased.<br>
Second, since the quality of the optical disc is tested easily and precisely, the reliability of the optical disc can be enhanced.<br>
Third, the scratch can be formed as much as to wish in a short time so that the testing time for the mechanical endurance test of the surface of the optical disc can be also decreased and the manufacturing cost may be reduced.<br>
It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications and variations can be made in the present invention. Thus, it is intended that the present invention covers the modifications and variations of this invention provided they come within the scope of the appended claims and their equivalents.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
