				<td>GASIFIERS WITH NON RADIAL TUYERES<br>
This invention relates to gasifiers and in particular to improvements in or relating to gasifiers whereby improved  combustion may take place therewithin. The invention further relates to a method of operating a gasifier. The production of producer gas (a mixture of about 30% carbon monoxide and 70% nitrogen, though other gases may also be present) is usually performed with a so-called gasifier, in which pyrolysis is performed. The gasifier comprises a chamber provided with air inlets in such a way that the burning of fuel within the chamber take place under controlled conditions. Originally, gasifiers used coal or coke as a fuel source, but interest in gasifiers has recently increased since they may be used for the disposal of various kinds of waste organic solid matter whilst yielding producer gas, which in turn may drive a combined heat and power unit, to yield both heat and electricity.   Thus, the solid fuel may typically comprise wood or wood derivatives, straw, poultry litter, dried sewage sludge and refuse-derived combustible material, to mention but a few.<br>
In a gasifier chamber, the solid fuel is reduced to a bed of carbon at a temperature of above 1000Â°C, a stream of air being passed through the bed with the combustion conditions set so that the oxygen in the air combines with the carbon to form carbon monoxide. Other gases such as methane and hydrogen may also be produced, depending upon the chemical composition of the fuel employed.<br>
A product of the combustion in a gasifier is ash, but this is of relatively low density and of small volume compared to the solid fuel supplied to the gasifier. It is consequently relatively easy to dispose of, especially since it is wholly sterile. By contrast, the producer gas may be used for a variety of purposes, though since it is toxic in view of the carbon monoxide content, it must nevertheless be treated with care. For example, the collected producer gas may immediately be used in an internal combustion engine for the generation of electricity, without being stored for long periods or otherwise handled.<br>
Though the principle upon which a gasifier operates is well known and understood,   it is  important that the  combustion  conditions  are closely<br><br>
controlled in order that the production of carbon monoxide &amp; optimised and that the carbon dioxide content of the producer gas Is minimised. Jt has now been established that by controlling the actual introduction of air into the oxidation zone of a gasifier, if is possible to improve the gasrfier performance, so increasing the overall efficiency of plant using this equipment<br>
Gasrfier designs have been proposed in NL-A-S900939 and CH-A-237348. In both of these prior designs, arrangements are made to introduce combustion air into a gasifier in such a way that the air is not directed strictly radially with respect to the axis of the combustion chamber, In an attempt to enhance combustion within the chamber. The present invention stems from attempts further to improve the production of producer gas.<br>
According to one aspect of the present Invention, there Is provided a gasifier for the production of producer gas from combustible material, comprising a chamber into which said material is introduced and a plurality of tuyeres disposed at or adjacent the lower end of the chamber for the introduction of air into the combustion chamber, each such tuyere defining an axis along which air is projected into the chamber, at least some of the tuyeres being configured to impart a rotational motion about said axis along which the air is projected into the chamber from each such tuyere, whereby the combustion air Is projected in the form of a jet steam which swirls about the length of the stream.<br>
Preferably, at least some of the tuyeres are disposed with their respective axes at an acute angle (when projected on to a horizontal plane containing the respective tuyere) to a tangent to the wall of the chamber at the location of that tuyere, the axis of projection of each said tuyere being in the same sense with respect to the axis of the chamber, whereby the projected air also tends to swirl around the chamber.<br>
It will be appreciated that the gasrfier of this invention is able to achieve better reduction of the fuel, by Improving the interaction between the introduced air and the hot carbonised bed at the bottom of the gasifier chamber. This interaction may be achieved either solely by causing the<br><br>
introduced air to rotate along the axis of projection.into the gasifier, or by additionally causing the introduced air to swirl around the lower region of the chamber.    By adopting both of these measures of this invention, the interaction of the air with the bed at the bottom of the gasifier is much enhanced, so giving better control of the combustion of the fuel. In turn, this leads to more complete combustion in the oxidation zone, giving a greater oxygen deficiency in the reduction zone and raising the proportion of carbon monoxide in the resultant producer gas.<br>
Most preferably, all of the tuyeres lie at substantially the same acute angle to the chamber wall where the respective tuyere projects therethrough. Thus, by having the angle of projection of each said tuyere in the same sense with respect to the axis of the chamber, the introduced air tends to swirl around the chamber interacting with all portions of the relatively hot carbon bed. This effect is enhanced by providing the tuyeres in a uniform distribution equi-spaced around the chamber.<br>
Advantageously, each tuyere is directed both at a non radial angle to the axis of the chamber and also upwardly of the chamber. In this way, penetration of the entire hot carbon bed by the introduced air may be assured.<br>
The chamber may be of general circular cross-sectfonal shape, at {east in the region of the tuyeres, with the axis of the chamber extending generally vertically. That chamber may have a lower waif of a generally conical shape and which supports a bed of the combustible material, said<br><br>
tuyeres being mounted in that lower conical wall. At the other end of the chamber, there may be provided an inlet orifice for combustible material, the upper portion of the chamber serving as a hopper for the material loaded thereinto. The inlet orifice advantageously Is fitted with a slide valve, to permit charging of the hopper whilst the gasifier Is in operation.<br>
Each tuyere is preferably in the form of a nozzle projecting through the chamber wall, the bore of the nozzle being configured to cause the air flow therethrough to rotate about its iength. This may be achieved by providing an insert within each said nozzle, the insert comprising a plate the width of<br><br>
which is substantially the same as the nozzle internal diameter and the plats being twisted along its length.<br>
This invention extends to a method of operating a gasifier for the production of producer gas from combustible material, which gasifier comprises a chamber into which said materiel is introduced and a plurality of tuyeres disposed at or adjacent the -lower end of the chamber, in which method air is introduced into the combustion chamber through the tuyeres and each tuyere is configured to impart a rotational motion about the axis of introduction of the air so that the combustion air is projected In the form of a jet stream which swirls about the length of the introduced stream.    In addition, the invention provides for the air being introduced through tuyeres at least some of which have their respective axes at an acute angle (when projected onto a horizontal plane containing the respective tuyere) to a  . tangent to a wall of the chamber at the location of that tuyere, whereby the air will tend to swirl around the chamber, simultaneously with the rotation of the air about its own axis.<br>
By way of example only, one specific embodiment of gasifier constructed and arranged in accordance with the present invention will now be described in detail, reference being made to the accompanying drawings in which:<br>
Figure 1 is a diagrammatic vertical sectfon through the embodiment of<br>
the gasifier;	' â¢<br>
Rgure 2 is a plan view on the lower wall of the gasifier chamber shown in Figure 1, with parts removed for clarity;<br>
Figure 3 is a detailed view on an enlarged scale through said lower wall;<br>
Figure 4 is an end-view on a tuyere of the gasifier of Figures 1 to 3; and<br>
Figure 5 illustrates an Insert plate of the tuyere nozzle of Figure 4.<br>
Referring initially to Figure 1, there is shown diagramrnatically an<br>
embodiment of gasifier arranged for the production of producer gas from a<br>
solid combustible material serving as a fuel, such as wood chippirtgs, logs,<br>
coal or similar materials, poultry litter, dried sewage sludge or a refuse<br><br>
derived fuel. The gasifler comprises a combustion chamber 10 having a generaJly conical lower wall 11 provided with a flange 12 around its upper periphery. A hopper 13 has a corresponding flange 14 at its lower, periphery and which is secured by botts (not shown) to flange 12 of the tower wan 11. The upper end of the hopper 13 is closed by a slide valve assembly 15, which permits recharging of the hopper with more solid fuel whilst operation of the gasffier continues. An actuator 15A is mounted to one side of the hopper, to effect opening and dosing of the slide valve assembly.<br>
In an alternative arrangement (not shown) the hopper has a simple lid which may be secured in position and a fuel feed arrangement may be provided to supply fuel into the upper part of the hopper.<br>
The lower wall 11 is carried on a base structure 16 which defines a plenum chamber 17 provided with an air inlet 18 and six lighting ports 19, each normally closed by a respective cap 20, the ports 19 being equi-spaced around the plenum chamber 17, The central region of the lower wall 11 communicates through opening 22 with a tube 23 within which the producer gas is formed during operation of the gasifier, the tube 23 leading to a lower chamber 24. A producer gas outlet pipe 25 passes through an outer wall 26 of the lower chamber 24 and there is provided a port 27 to that chamber, normally closed by a blanking plate 28 but through which access to the chamber may be gained for example for ash removal and servicing.<br>
An automated ash removal system is fitted below the tube 23. This comprises an eccentric grate assembly 40 mounted on a shaft 41 rotatably supported below the base wall of the lower chamber 24. The shaft 41 also carries a scraper bar 42 having chains which serve to plough collected ash into a discharge chute 43 below lower chamber 24. A motor 44 is drivingly connected by chain 45 to the shaft 41 to effect rotation of both the grate assembly 40 and the scraper bar 42. A discharge auger 46 takes discharged ash from the chute 43, through a water seal provided at the bottom of that chute.<br>
Air enters the plenum 17 through inlet 18 and passes into the combustion chamber 10 through a plurality of tuyeres 30, provided in the conical lower wall 11 of the chamber. As best seen in Figure 2, six such tuyeres 30 are provided, equi-spaced. around the opening 22 in alignment with the lighting ports 19. The tuyeres all lie at substantially the same angle to the vertical axis 31 of the combustion chamber 10 and also all lie at substantially the same angle to a horizontal radius of the chamber intersecting the respective tuyere. Thus, air entering the combustion chamber will tend to swirl around the chamber in a counter-clockwise direction and at the same time to rise upwardly within the chamber.<br>
Each tuyere 30 is fitted with an insert 33 so as to impart a spin on the jet of air issuing from the tuyere into the combustion chamber 10. The insert is in the form of a plate having a width substantially equal to the diameter of the tuyere, as shown in Figure 4, and is twisted through 90Â° along its length.<br>
In this way, the air passing through the tuyere will be caused to swirl about the axis of the tuyere.<br>
In operation, solid fuel pieces are loaded into the hopper 13 through the slide valve assembly 15 and then the air flow is commenced by reducing the pressure at the producer gas outlet 25.  This draws air through inlet 18 into the plenum 17, the air then swirling around that plenum 17 and assisting cooling of the lower plate 11, when operation of the gasifier has been established.   From the plenum 17, the air is drawn through the tuyeres 30 into the bed on the lower wall 11 and down through opening 22, tube 23 and into the lower chamber 24 by the reduced pressure at the producer gas outlet 25. The gasifier is lit through at least one of the ports 19, for example with a gas torch, and the combustion within the chamber 10 is established. When fully operational, the upper region 35 of the gasifier will be at around 500Â° C and will serve as a distillation zone for high molecular weight hydrocarbons.   Below that, there is a carbonisation zone 36 operating at around 600Â° C, where the solid fuel is converted to charcoal, by burning off other matter.     Oh and immediately above the lower wall  11,  there is established an oxidation zone 37, operating at around 1200Â° C, where the carbon is burned in air to form CO2-    The hot carbon then falls through opening 22 into tube 23 and on to grate 40, there being a deficiency of oxygen in the tube 23 to continue the combustion of the carbon and so a reduction process takes place, reducing the CO2 to CO.  The final producer gas mixture leaves the lower chamber 24 through pipe 25.<br>
During operation of the gasifier, the motor 4 4 is operated intermittently slowly to drive the grate assembly 40. The eccentricity of this assembly grinds any large pieces which then fall through the lower chamber 24 and are ploughed into the discharge chute 43. The motor may be operated continuously, depending upon the ash content of the fuel source.<br>
A typical producer gas composition obtained from using wood as a fuel source may be as follows:<br>
GAS	% by weight<br>
Nitrogen	45-54<br>
carbon monoxide	18r25<br>
hydrogen	13-15<br>
water vapour	10-15<br>
carbon dioxide	5-10<br>
methane	3-5<br>
By adopting the measures as described above concerning the disposition of the tuyeres and also the internal configuration thereof, and so improving the introduction of air into the oxidation zone through the tuyeres, it is found the carbon dioxide content may significantly be reduced, with a consequent improvement in the carbon monoxide content of the producer gas.<br><br><br><br><br>
