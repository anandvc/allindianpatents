				<td>1.4-HYDROGENATION OF SORBOL WITH RU COMPLEXES<br>
Technical field<br>
The present invention relates to the field of catalytic hydrogenation and, more<br>
particularly, to the use of specific Ru complexes with cyclopentadienyl derivatives, as one<br>
of the ligands, in 1,4-hydrogenation processes for the reduction of sorbol into the<br>
corresponding Z-alkene, as major product.<br>
Prior Art<br>
Selective 1,4-hydrogenation of conjugated dienes, in general, into their Z-alkene is<br>
a very interesting reaction in organic chemistry, since it renders accessible a number of<br>
compounds which are obtained in general with a poor selectivity.<br>
One of the mandatory and characterizing elements of such processes is the catalyst<br>
or the catalytic system. The development of useful catalysts or catalytic systems for the<br>
1,4-hydrogenation of sorbol into the corresponding Z-alkene is still an important, difficult<br>
and unpredictable task in chemistry. The chemical industry is always eager for higher<br>
selectivity, as well as to maintain a high conversion or yield.<br>
From the prior art it is known that sorbic acid can be hydrogenated into the<br>
corresponding Z-alkene in the presence of [(Cp*)RuCO(phosphine)](anion) or<br>
[(Cp*)RuCO(sorbic acid)](anion) complexes, (Cp* representing a CsMes or pentamethyl-<br>
cyclopentadienyl ligand; see Driessen et al, in Chem.Commun., 2000, 217 or in<br>
J.Organomet.Chem, 1998, 141), however the yields (conversions x selectivity) are quite<br>
low.<br>
Furthermore, in EP 1394170, it is reported the cisoid hydrogenation of sorbic acid<br>
and sorbol using as catalytic systems the complex [(Dienyl)Ru(acyclic diene)](anion) (in<br>
particular [(Cp*)Ru(sorbic acid)](anion) or [(Cp*)Ru(sorbol)](anion). In this document it<br>
is expressively reported that the use of cyclic diene, instead of acyclic diene, is highly<br>
detrimental to the overall yield. The only conditions displayed as providing good yields<br>
require nitromethane as solvent, the latter being relatively toxic and hazardous for<br>
industrial applications. Finally, Table 4 of said document shows that the addition of Lewis<br>
acids is highly detrimental to the yields.<br>
Therefore, there is a need for processes using alternative catalytic systems<br>
systems possibly providing high selectivity and/or conversions.<br><br>
Description of the invention<br>
In order to overcome the problems aforementioned, the present invention relates to<br>
processes for the catalytic reduction by 1,4-hydrogenation, using molecular H2, of<br>
sorbol (I) into the corresponding Z-alkene (II) (i.e. Z-hex-3-en-ol) characterized in that<br>
said process is carried out in the presence of at least an acidic additive of the type<br>
specified further below, the catalyst or pre-catalyst being a ruthenium complex<br>
comprising as ligand a cyclopentadienyl derivative.<br>
The invention's process is shown in Scheme 1:<br>
Scheme 1<br><br>
wherein compound (II) is in a Z configuration.<br>
A particular embodiment of the invention is a process for the catalytic reduction<br>
by 1,4-hydrogenation, using molecular H2, of sorbol of formula<br><br>
into the corresponding Z-alkene, of formula<br><br>
wherein the isomer of configuration Z is predominant;<br>
said process being characterized in that it is carried out in the presence of<br>
- at least one ruthenium catalyst or pre-catalyst of formula<br><br>
wherein C5Me5epresents pentamethyl-cyclopentadienyl, COD a cyclooctadiene<br>
ligand and X represents a non coordinated anion, n represents 2, 1 or 0 and L'<br><br>
represents a solvent; and<br>
- at least an acidic additive of the type described further below, preferably in a total<br>
amount of about 0.1, or even 0.2, to 100 molar equivalents, relative to the<br>
compound (III).<br>
Concerning compound (II), since it is an olefin, it can be obtained in the form of a<br>
mixture of two isomers, i.e. the one having a configuration Z (Z-alkene (II)) or the one<br>
having a configuration E (E-alkene (II'))<br><br>
It is understood that according to the invention the alkene obtained is in the form<br>
of a mixture Z-alkene and E-alkene, wherein the ratio Z-alkene / E-alkene (Z/E) is above<br>
1. According to a particular embodiment, said ratio is above 10 or even above 20. In<br>
another particular embodiment, said Z/E ratio can be above 30 or even above 35, and in<br>
some cases ratio of above 45 or more can be obtained. In any case the presence of the<br>
acidic additive in the prescribed concentration range allows to improve said ratio.<br>
The substrate (I), due to the fact that it is a diene, can be in the form of a mixture<br>
of its three configuration isomers, i.e. the (Z,Z), (E,Z) and (E,E) isomers. According to a<br>
particular embodiment of the invention, said substrate can be essentially in the form of its<br>
(Z,Z) isomer (e.g. comprising at least 99% w/w of the isomer (Z,Z)).<br>
The process of the invention is characterized by the use, as catalyst or pre-catalyst<br>
(hereinafter referred to as complexes unless specified otherwise), of a specific type of<br>
ruthenium complex as [Ru(C5Me5)(COD)(L')n]X, as defined above.<br>
According to a particular embodiment of the invention, L' can be acyclic or cyclic<br>
non aromatic ketones or esters, such as acetone or methyl acetate. The ketone can be<br>
coordinated in its enolic form.<br>
The COD ligand can be any isomer of cyclooctadiene, namely cycloocta-1,5-diene<br>
(1,5-COD), cycloocta-1,4-diene (1,4-COD), cycloocta-1,3-diene (1,3-COD).<br>
Particular examples of the non-coordinated anion X are C1O4-,R1SO3-, wherein R1<br>
is a chlorine of fluoride atom or an C1-C8 fluoroalkyl or fluoroaryl group, BF4,- PF6-,<br>
SbCl6% SbF26-, or BRV, wherein R2 is a phenyl group optionally substituted by one to five<br><br>
groups such as halide atoms or methyl or CF3 groups.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, the anion is BF4, PF6,<br>
ClO4-, C6F5SO3-, BPh4-, CF3SO3- or yet B[3,5-(CF3)2C6H4]4-, even more preferably BF4.<br>
As examples of the complex (III) one may cite the following: [Ru(C5Me5)(1,3-<br>
COD)]BF4.<br>
In a general way, the complexes of formula (III) can be prepared and isolated prior<br>
to their use in the process according to the general methods described in the literature (for<br>
example see F. Bouachir et al.; Organometallics, 1991, pg 455).<br>
It is also understood that the complex of formula (III) can also be obtained in situ<br>
from complexes which have a similar formula and are cationic or anionic according to the<br>
standard knowledge of a person skilled in the art. For example, reaction can be run using<br>
[Ru(C5Me5)(COD)Y] (Y being F, Cl, Br or I and method for preparation having been<br>
described by P.J. Fagan et al. in Organometallics, 1990, 9, pg 1843-1852) as precursors in<br>
the presence of the substrate and silver or tallium salts).<br>
To carry out the processes of the invention it is required also to use at least an<br>
acidic additive. By "acidic additive" it is meant a compound capable of providing at least<br>
one proton to the catalytic cycle. Said acidic additive is preferably an organic or inorganic<br>
acid having a pKa comprised between 0.8 and 7, but in the case of phenols or boron<br>
derivatives said pKa can range up to 10.<br>
Furthermore, said acidic additive and can be selected from the group consisting of:<br>
-	a compound of formula R3(3-x)MO(OH)x, wherein R3 is a R4or R4O group wherein R4 is<br>
a C1-C10 group, M is P or As and x is 1 or 2; and<br>
-	a boron derivative of formula R3B(OH)2, wherein R3 is as defined above; and<br>
-	phenol or a phenol substituted by up to three C1-C4 alkyl, alkoxy or carboxylic groups,<br>
nitro groups or halogen atoms; and<br>
-	a C1-C12 mono-carboxylic non-amino acid; and<br>
-	a HOOCCH=CHCOOH di-acide, and the tetronic acid.<br>
By "mono-carboxylic non-amino acid" it is meant here a mono-carboxylic acid<br>
which is not substituted by a primary, secondary or tertiary amino group or<br>
heteroaromatic nitrogen derivatives.<br>
According to a particular embodiment, said R3(3-x)MO(OH)x acids can be a<br>
derivative wherein R3 is a C1-C8 alkyl or alkoxyl group or a C1-C8 phenyl or phenoxyl<br>
group optionally substituted, M is P or As and x is 1 or 2.<br><br>
Similarly said R2B(OH)2 acids can be those wherein R3 is a C1-C8 alkyl or alkoxyl<br>
group or a C1-C8 phenyl or phenoxyl group optionally substituted.<br>
According to another embodiment of the invention, said acid can be the phenol or<br>
a phenol substituted by one C1-C4 alkyl, alkoxy or carboxylic group, a nitro group or a<br>
halogen atom.<br>
Furthermore, according to another particular embodiment of the invention, said<br>
acidic additive can be a mono-carboxylic acid of formula R5COOH, wherein R5<br>
represents a C1-C12 hydrocarbon group or a C1-C12 halogenated or per-halogenated<br>
hydrocarbon group, optionally substituted by one alcohol group or one or two ether or<br>
ester groups. According to a further embodiment, said carboxylic acid is advantageously<br>
selected from the group consisting of:<br>
-	a carboxylic acid of formula R5COOH, wherein R5 represents<br>
a halogenated or per-halogenated C1-C8 hydrocarbon group;<br>
a R6CH(OR6) group, R6 being a hydrogen atom or a C1-C6 hydrocarbon group;<br>
a C1-C12 hydrocarbon group, optionally substituted by one or two ether or ester groups,<br>
the optional substituent being by one two or three C1-C4 alkyl, alkoxy or carboxylic<br>
groups, or nitro groups or halogen atoms.<br>
One can cite, as non-limiting examples, of said acidic additive the following:<br>
(BuO)2PO(OH), (tBuO)2PO(OH), (PhO)2PO(OH), (PhCH2O)2PO(OH), tBuPO(OH)2,<br>
Ph2PO(OH), PhPO(OH)2, PhAsO(OH)2, (Me)2AsO(OH), CF3COOH, HCF2COOH,<br>
maleic or fumaric acid, glycolic acid, pyruvic acid, sorbic, acetic or oleic acid, tetronic<br>
acid, C6H13B(OH)2, PhB(OH)2, p-OMe-benzoic, benzoic or p-(COOMe)-benzoic acid,<br>
phenoL 3,5-dimethoxy-phenol or 2-methoxy-phenol. Of course, other suitable acidic<br>
additives responding to the above description can be used.<br>
According to another embodiment of the invention, said acidic additive can be<br>
selected from the group consisting of:<br>
-	a compound of formula R32MO(OH) or R3MO(OH)2, wherein R3 is a C1-C6 alkyl or<br>
alkoxyl group or a C1-C8 phenyl or phenoxyl and M is P or As; and<br>
-	maleic or glycolic acid and an halogenated or per-halogenated C1-C7 mono-carboxylic<br>
acid.<br>
As previously mentioned the processes of the invention consist in the<br>
hydrogenation of a substrate using a ruthenium complex and an acidic additive. A typical<br>
process implies the mixture of the substrate with the ruthenium complex, at least one<br><br>
acidic additive and optionally a solvent, and then treating such a mixture with molecular<br>
hydrogen at a chosen pressure and temperature.<br>
The complexes of the invention, an essential parameter of the process, can be<br>
added to the reaction medium in a large range of concentrations. As non-limiting<br>
examples, one can cite as complex concentration values those ranging from 0.01 mol% to<br>
5 mol%, the molar percentage being relative to the amount of substrate. Preferably, the<br>
complex concentration will be comprised between 0.03 mol% to 2 mol%. It goes without<br>
saying that the optimum concentration of complex will depend, as the person skilled in<br>
the art knows, on the nature of the latter, on the nature of the substrate, on the nature of<br>
the solvent and on the pressure of H2 used during the process, as well as the desired time<br>
of reaction.<br>
Useful quantities of acidic additive, added to the reaction mixture, may be<br>
comprised in a relatively large range. Apart from the one above cited, one can cite, as<br>
non-limiting examples, total amounts ranging between 0.5 to 50 molar equivalents,<br>
relative to the complex, preferably 0.8 to 20, and even more preferably between about 2<br>
and about 10 molar equivalents.<br>
The hydrogenation reaction can be carried out in the presence or absence of a<br>
solvent. When a solvent is required or used for practical reasons, then any solvent current<br>
in hydrogenation reactions can be used for the purposes of the invention. Non-limiting<br>
examples include non-aromatic solvents such as C1-C12 non aromatic ketones, esters,<br>
alkanes ethers, chlorinated alkanes and alcohols or mixtures thereof. According to an<br>
embodiment of the invention the solvent is advantageously selected amongst the C1-C12<br>
alkyl ketones, esters, ethers or chlorinated alkanes and mixtures thereof. In particular and<br>
as non-limiting examples one may cite the following: acetone ethyl acetate, MTBE, THF,<br>
iso-propyl acetate, Et2O, dichloromethane, 1,2-dichloethane, EtOH, MeOH, pentane,<br>
hexane. The choice of the solvent can be done as a function of the nature of the complex<br>
and the person skilled in the art is well able to select the solvent most convenient in each<br>
case to optimize the hydrogenation reaction.<br>
In the hydrogenation process of the invention, the reaction can be carried out at a<br>
H2 pressure comprised between 105Pa and 80xl05Pa (1 to 80 bars) or even more if<br>
desired. Again, a person skilled in the art is well able to adjust the pressure as a function<br>
of the catalyst load and of the dilution of the substrate in the solvent. As examples, one<br>
can cite typical pressures of 1 to 30x 105 Pa (1 to 30 bar).<br><br>
The temperature at which the hydrogenation can be carried out is comprised<br>
between 0°C and 120°C, more preferably in the range of between 40°C and 100°C. Of<br>
course, a person skilled in the art is also able to select the preferred temperature as a<br>
function of the melting and boiling point of the starting and final products as well as the<br>
desired time of reaction or conversion.<br>
Examples<br>
The invention will now be described in further detail by way of the following<br>
examples, wherein the temperatures are indicated in degrees centigrade and the<br>
abbreviations have the usual meaning in the art.<br>
All the procedures described hereafter have been carried out under an inert<br>
atmosphere unless stated otherwise. Hydrogenations were carried out in open glass tubes<br>
placed inside a stainless steel autoclave. H2 gas (99.99990%) was used as received. All<br>
substrates and solvents were distilled from appropriate drying agents under Ar. NMR<br>
spectra were recorded on a Bruker AM-400 (1H at 400.1 MHz, 13C at 100.6 MHz)<br>
spectrometer and normally measured at 300 K, in CDCU unless indicated otherwise.<br>
Chemical shifts are listed in ppm.<br>
Example 1<br>
Hydrogenation processes according to the invention<br>
Typical hydrogenation reaction procedure<br>
2,4-Haxanedienol, solvent, [Ru(CsMes)(COD)]X and the acidic additive according to the<br>
invention were loaded altogether under inert atmosphere an autoclave and the mixture<br>
was purged at room temperature with nitrogen (2 bars, 3 times) and then hydrogen (2<br>
bars, 3 times) under stirring. The autoclave was then pressurized to the desired hydrogen<br>
pressure and heated at the desired temperature. The reaction was followed by hydrogen<br>
absorption monitoring and/or GC analysis sampling. The ruthenium catalyst was easily<br>
removed by distillation on residues and product isomers mixture was usually recovered in<br>
more than 90% molar yield.<br>
