				<td>CANCER  VACCINE<br>
Field  of  the   Invention<br>
The invention relates generally to the field of cancer diagnosis, prognosis, treatment and prevention. More particularly, the present invention relates to methods of diagnosing, treating and preventing lung cancer. In particular, aspects of the invention are directed to methods of diagnosing, treating and preventing small cell lung cancers. Methods of using a nucleic acid and/or a protein, which are differentially expressed in tumor cells, and antibodies immunospecific for the protein, to treat, diagnose and/or prevent said cancers, are provided for by the  present   invention.<br>
Background  to  the   Invention<br>
Cancer is characterized primarily by an increase in the number of abnormal cells derived from a given normal tissue, invasion of adjacent tissues by these abnormal cells, and lymphatic or blood-borne spread of malignant cells to regional lymph nodes and to distant sites (metastases). Clinical data and molecular biologic studies indicate that cancer is a multistep process that begins with minor preneoplastic changes, which may under certain conditions progress  to  neoplasia.<br>
Pre-malignant abnormal cell growth is exemplified by hyperplasia, metaplasia, or most particularly, dysplasia (for review of such abnormal growth conditions, see Robbins &amp; Angell, 1976, Basic Pathology, 2d Ed., W.B. Saunders Co., Philadelphia,   pp.    68-79)    The   neoplastic   lesion  may   evolve<br>
CONFIRMATION COPY<br>
clonally and develop an increasing capacity for growth, metastasis, and heterogeneity, especially under conditions in which the neoplastic cells escape the host's immune surveillance (Roitt, I., Brostoff, J. and Kale, D., 1993, Immunology, 3rd ed., Mosby, St. Louis, pps. 17.1-17.12) . The epidemiology of cancer in the United States is estimated at greater than 1,300,000 new cases and greater than 550,000 deaths (Jemal et al., 2003, CA Cancer J. Clin., 53, 5-26) estimated for 2003. Lung cancer is one of the most common cancers with an estimated 172,000 new cases projected for 2003 and 157,000 deaths in the US (Jemal et al.., 2003, CA Cancer J. Clin., 53, 5-26). Lung carcinomas are typically classified as either small cell lung carcinomas (SCLC) or non-small cell lung carcinomas (NSCLC). SCLC comprises about 20% of all lung cancers with NSCLC comprising the remaining approximately 80%. NSCLC is further divided into adenocarcinoma (AC) (about 30-35% of all cases), squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) (about 30% of all cases) and large cell carcinoma (LCC) (about 10% of all cases) . Additional NSCLC subtypes, not as clearly defined in the literature, include adenosquamous cell carcinoma (ASCC), and bronchioalveolar carcinoma   (BAC).<br>
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide, and more specifically NSCLC accounts for approximately 80% of all disease cases (Cancer Facts and Figures, 2002, American Cancer Society, Atlanta, p. 11.). There are four major types of NSCLC, including adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, bronchioalveolar carcinoma, and large cell carcinoma. Adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma are the most common types of NSCLC based on cellular morphology (Travis et al., 1996, Lung Cancer Principles and Practice, Lippincott-Raven,   New  York,   pps.   361-395).   Adenocarcinomas<br>
are characterized by a more peripheral location in the lung and often have a mutation in the K-ras oncogene (Gazdar et al., 1994, Anticancer Res. 14:261-267). Squamous cell carcinomas are typically more centrally located and frequently carry p53 gene mutations (Niklinska et al., 2001, Folia  Histochem.   Cytobiol.   39:147-148).<br>
Lung carcinoma is the number one killer amongst cancer patients, for which no adequate treatment exists, corresponding to about one-fifth of all cancer deaths in Europe (IARC). The growing burden on the population is probably best illustrated from recent studies in the US, showing that between 1960 and 1990, deaths from lung cancer among woman increased over 4 00% in the period to exceed breast  cancer  deaths.<br>
Currently no adequate treatment protocols for the different types of lung cancer exist. With conventional therapy, median survival for the subtype of SCLC is 15 months for limited-stage disease and 9 months for extensive-stage disease, whereas long-term survival is very low. Major obstacles to the successful treatment and eradication of lung cancer are late diagnosis, highly metastatic behaviour, resistance to chemotherapy and the impossibility to surgically remove all cancer cells. In principle, cancer vaccines are a most promising approach for the treatment of cancer in general and lung cancer in particular. Major obstacles in the development of a successful vaccine are the lack of cancer specific antigens to be targeted and the lack of tools to evaluate immunotherapy based on such targets. An additional problem is the above cited heterogeneity of lung cancer.<br>
In  contrast   to  many  other  types  of  cancer,   lung  cancer treatment  has  not   resulted  in  significant  improvements   in<br>
survival   rates  during  the  last  decades,   showing  an  overall 5-year   survival  of  only  14%   (Haura  EB.2001,   Cancer Control;   8:   326-336.<br>
(www.medscape.com/viewarticle/40 905 9)\;	Crawford<br>
J.(www.medscape.com/viewarticle/429347_l).<br>
To  date  the  decision  upon  treatment  protocols   is   especially<br>
guided  by  the   subdivision   into   SCLC   and  NSCLC.      Unlike   the<br>
other      types      of      lung     cancer,      SCLC      is      sensitive      to<br>
chemotherapy.      In  about  75%   of  the  cases  of  SCLC  an  initial<br>
response   to   chemotherapy   can  be   noticed,   with   a   clinically<br>
complete  response   in  about   35%  of  all   cases   (Johnson  DH,   et<br>
al.,     1987;    Am    J    Med    Sci    293:    377-389).        Unfortunately,<br>
however,   in  most  cases  relapse  occurs,   resulting  in  a  three-<br>
year   survival   rate   of   only   5-10%,   and  a   five-year   survival<br>
rate   of   about   1%    (Minna   JD, et  al.   1985,   Cancer   of   the   lung.<br>
In:   Cancer.   Principles  and  practice  of  oncology  2nd  ed) ;<br>
Within   SCLC   a   clinically   relevant   subdivision   can   be   made<br>
between  classic  and  variant   SCLC.   The  variant-type  of  SCLC<br>
appears    to    be    even    less    sensitive    to    chemotherapy    and<br>
radiotherapy.       As   a    result    the   median   survival  "time    of<br>
patients     suffering     from     the    variant-type     of     SCLC     is<br>
significantly  shorter  than  of  those  with  a  classic  type  of<br>
SCLC    (Radice   PA,   et al.      1982,   Cancer;    50:   2894-2902).   Also<br>
for  patients   with   a   combined  SCLC   a   poorer  prognosis   than<br>
for  patients  with  classic  SCLC  is  observed   (Hirsch  FR  et  al,<br>
1983,    Cancer;    52:   2144-2150).   Approximately   75%   to   80%   of<br>
cases   are   of   the   NSCLC   histology,    and   the   majority   of<br>
patients  present  with  either  locally  advanced disease   (stage<br>
III)     or    metastatic    disease     (stage     IV).	Importantly,<br>
patients undergoing curative surgical resection for apparent localized disease have survival rates ranging between 50% and  80%,   implying  the  need  for  better  systemic  treatment   to<br>
cure occult micrometastatic disease. In NSCLC treatment with chemotherapy is in general unsuccessful (Minna JD,et al. 1985, Cancer of the lung. In: Cancer. Principles and practice of oncology ; 2nd ed.) . Therefore, with the exception of high cure rates for surgical treatment of truly localized disease, the prognosis for patients with NSCLC is grim (Mulshine JL,et al. 1986., J Clin Oncol; 4: 1704-1715). In a small subset of patients, however, a response to chemotherapy can be observed. In part, these cases might represent NSCLC in which SCLC-components occur since such a heterogeneous composition is quite common in lung cancer (see above) . It may be obvious from, these data that alternative treatment modalities for these patients are critical.<br>
The main objective of the present invention is the development of a new model for the biology and antigenicity of lung cancer and developing a new concept for a lung cancer vaccination therapy. The approach will be directed towards target discovery - antigens specific for SCLC and NSCLC  and   immunization  strategies.<br>
A number of tumor-associated antigens have been identified<br>
in human lung cancers and are being used as targets for<br>
general      lung      cancer      vaccines.	These      include      the<br>
carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), human epithelial mucin MUC-1, the cancer-testis antigen NY-ESO-1, and the ganglioside Fuc-GMl (Haura EB. 2001, Cancer Control,8: 326-336; www.medscape.com/viewarticle/409059). Vaccination of tumor patients with inactivated tumor cells has been triad decades ago with not much success. The intra-tumoral injection of heat-killed Mycobacteria into SCLC lesions as an adjuvant with autologous tumor cells has led to some success. NSCLC   can   evoke    specific   humoral   and   cellular   antitumor<br>
immune responses in some patients (Salgia R,et al. 2003; J clin Oncol; 21:624-630.) . Serology-based cloning strategies have identified multiple tumor-associated antigens, including eIF4G, aldolase, annexin XI, Rip-1, and NY-LU-12. Humoral responses to autologous lung cancer cells may be associated with prolonged survival. T-cell-based cloning strategies similarly have revealed diverse targets in NSCLC, including Her2/neu, SART-1, SART-2, KIAA0156, ART-1, ART-4, cyclophilin B, mutated elongation factor 2, malic enzyme, and alpha-actinin-4. The development of cytotoxic T-lymphocyte responses to NSCLC may also be correlated with prolonged  survival.<br>
In clinical practice, accurate diagnosis of various subtypes of cancer is important because treatment options, prognosis, and the likelihood of therapeutic response all vary broadly depending on the diagnosis. Accurate prognosis, or determination of distant metastasis-free survival could allow an oncologist to tailor the administration of adjuvant chemotherapy, with patients having poorer prognoses being given more aggressive treatment. Furthermore, accurate prediction of poor prognosis would greatly impact clinical trials for new lung cancer therapies, because potential study patients could then be stratified according to prognosis. Trials could be limited to patients having poor prognosis, in turn making it easier to discern if an experimental therapy is efficacious. To date, no set of satisfactory predictors for prognosis based on the clinical information  alone   has  been   identified.<br>
It would, therefore, be beneficial to provide specific methods and reagents for the diagnosis, staging, prognosis, monitoring and treatment of cancer, including lung cancer. It  would  also  be  beneficial  to  provide  methods  that  identify<br>
individuals with a predisposition for the onset of lung cancer, and other types of cancer, and hence are appropriate subjects  for  preventive  therapy.<br>
Summary  of  the   Invention<br>
Using differential expression methods the present inventors identified and characterized the NCAM-180 and variants thereof, as a gene whose expression is associated with lung cancer and other types of cancer. This discovery by the present inventors has made possible the use of NCAM-180 molecules and variants thereof for the treatment, prevention and diagnosis of cancers, including but not limited to lung cancer, in particular also in the treatment, prevention and diagnosis of neuronal and neuroendocrine cancers. The novel NCAM-180 has an upregulated expression pattern in cancer tissues and cell lines, e.g., lung cancer tissues and cell lines are shown and described. Also shown and described is Exonl8_MUM a fragment of NCAM-180 that retains at least one functional characteristic of the full length, wild type NCAM-180 gene. Methods of using the gene, gene products, and antagonists or agonists of the gene or gene products (NCAM-180 and variants thereof, cDNA, RNA, and/or protein) as targets for diagnosis, drug screening and therapies for cancer are also shown and described. Also disclosed is the use of the genes or gene products or derivatives thereof as vaccines against cancer. In one embodiment, methods are provided for using an NCAM-180 protein (such as SEQ ID No.4), fragments thereof, in particular Exonl8_MUM (such as SEQ ID NOs: 2 and 6), and variants thereof, or nucleic acids that  encode  said  proteins  for  the  treatment,   prevention  and<br>
diagnosis  of   lung  cancer.<br>
Isolated nucleotide sequences of NCAM-180 gene cDNA or variants thereof are provided. Specifically, isolated cDNA sequences of human NCAM-180 and the Exonl8_MUM fragments thereof (SEQ ID NOs: 1, 3 and 5) are provided herein. Also provided are isolated amino acid sequences encoded.by SEQ ID NOs: 1, 3 and 5 which are denoted SEQ ID NOs: 2, 4 and 6. The present invention further relates to methods for the diagnostic evaluation and prognosis of cancer in a subject animal. Preferably the subject is a mammal, more preferably the subject is a human. In a preferred embodiment the invention relates to methods for diagnostic evaluation and prognosis of lung cancer. For example, nucleic acid molecules of the invention can be used as diagnostic hybridization probes or as primers for diagnostic PCR analysis for detection of abnormal expression of an NCAM-180 gene.<br>
Antibodies or other binding partners to NCAM-180 or variants thereof can be used in a diagnostic test to detect the presence of an NCAM-180 product in body fluids, cells or in tissue biopsy. In specific embodiments, measurement of serum or cellular NCAM-180 and variants thereof can be made to detect or type lung cancer, e.g., adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, bronchioalveolar carcinoma, or large cell carcinoma; in particular to detect or type SCLC. Further, methods are presented for the treatment of cancer, including lung cancer. Such methods comprise the administration of compositions that are capable of modulating the level of NCAM-180 and variants thereof, including modulation of NCAM-180 gene expression and/or the level of an NCAM-180 gene product activity in a subject. The subject    can    be    any    animal,     preferably    a    mammal,     more<br>
 <br>
preferably  a  human.<br>
The invention also provides methods for preventing cancer wherein NCAM-180 or variants thereof, in particular Exonl8_MUM or fragments thereof that are capable of inducing a humoral or a cellular immune response in a mammal, is administered to a subject in an amount effective to elicit an immune response in the subject. The Exonl8_MUM fragments are further characterized in that they comprise from 5 to 30 amino acids, in particular from 9 to 15 amino acids and comprise an epitope selected from PAASNLSSSVLAN (AA101-113 of SEQ ID N0:2), VLSPSAPAGVG (AA 117-127 of SEQ ID N0:2), LAAAAAPATEAPQ (AA 153-165 of SEQ ID N0:2), KGPDPEPTQPGA (AA 174-185 of SEQ ID NO:2) and DFKMDEGNFK (AA 216-225 of SEQ ID NO:2)  .<br>
The subject may be any animal, preferably a mammal, more preferably a human. The invention also provides methods for treating or preventing cancer by administering a nucleic acid sequence encoding an NCAM-180 protein or a variant, in particular encoding for Exonl8_MUM or fragments thereof that are capable of inducing a humoral or a cellular immune response in a mammal, thereof to a subject such that expression of the NCAM-180 protein or variant results in the production of these polypeptides in an amount effective to elicit an immune response. The immune response may be humoral, cellular, or a combination of both. In a preferred embodiment the invention provides a method of immunizing to confer protection against the onset of lung cancer. The invention also provides methods for treating cancer by providing therapeutic amounts of an anti-sense nucleic acid molecule. An anti-sense molecule is a nucleic acid molecule that is a complement of all or a part of an NCAM-180 gene sequence  and which,  therefore,  can  hybridize  to  the  NCAM-180<br>
gene and variants thereof, in particular to Exonl8_MUM, a fragment of NCAM-180. Accordingly, hybridization of the anti-sense molecule can reduce or inhibit expression of NCAM-180. In a preferred embodiment the method is used to treat  lung  cancer.<br>
The invention also includes a kit for assessing whether a patient is afflicted with lung cancer or other types of cancer. This kit comprises reagents for assessing expression levels of NCAM-180 or a variant, including fragments thereof such as Exonl8_MUM or fragments thereof that are capable of inducing a humoral or a cellular immune response in a mammal. In another aspect, the kit comprises an antibody, wherein the antibody binds specifically with a protein corresponding to NCAM-180 and variants thereof, in particular Exonl8_MUM or fragments thereof that are capable of inducing a humoral or a cellular immune response in a mammal. The kit may also comprise a plurality of antibodies, wherein the plurality binds specifically with different epitopes of an NCAM-180 and variants thereof, in particular with Exonl8_MUM fragments that comprise from 5 to 30 amino acids, in particular from 9 to 15 amino acids and comprise an epitope selected from PAASNLSSSVLAN (AA101-113 of SEQ ID N0:2), VLSPSAPAGVG (AA 117-127 of SEQ ID N0:2), LAAAAAPATEAPQ (AA 153-165 of SEQ ID NO:2), KGPDPEPTQPGA (AA 174-185 of SEQ ID NO:2) and DFKMDEGNFK (AA 216-225 of SEQ ID NO:2).<br>
In an alternative embodiment, the kit comprises a nucleic acid (e.g., oligonucleotide) probe. The probe binds specifically to a transcribed polynucleotide corresponding to an NCAM-180 gene product and variants thereof. The kit may also comprise a plurality of probes, wherein each of the probes   binds   specifically   to   a   transcribed  polynucleotide<br>
corresponding to a different region of the mRNA sequence transcribed from the NCAM-180 gene and variants thereof, in particular to the nucleic acid sequence encoding for Exonl8_MUM, a fragment of NCAM-180. In a more particular embodiment probes consist essentially of 15 to 50, 18 to 35, 15 to 24, 18 to 30, 18 to 21 or 21 to 24 nucleotides of a sequence encoding a polypeptide of the invention or its complement. In an even further embodiment, kits for diagnostic use, including primers for use in PCR that can amplify an NCAM-180 cDNA and variants thereof, including the corresponding cDNA and/or genes and a standard amount of the NCAM-180  cDNA  are  also  provided.<br>

In one embodiment of the foregoing diagnostic method, the subject   is   a   human.    In   another   embodiment,    the   cancer   is<br>
lung cancer. In yet other embodiments, the sample is a tissue sample, a plurality of cells, or a bodily fluid. The present invention further provides methods for treating cancer in a subject, comprising administering to the subject an amount of a compound which reduces the level and/or antagonizes the activity of an NCAM-180 product and variants thereof, including fragments such as Exonl8_MUM and others as defined hereinbefore, wherein said NCAM-180 product is (a) an RNA corresponding to one of SEQ ID NOs: 1, 3 or 5, or a nucleic acid derived therefrom; (b) a protein comprising one of SEQ ID NOs: 2, 4 or 6; (c) a nucleic acid comprising a sequence hybridi-zable to one af SEQ ID NOs: 1, 3 or 5, or a complement thereof under conditions of high stringency, or a protein comprising a sequence encoded by said hybridizable sequence; (d) a nucleic acid at least 90% homologous to one of SEQ ID NOs: 1, 3 or 5, or a complement thereof as determined using the NBLAST algorithm, or a protein encoded thereby. In one embodiment, a gene product whose expression is being decreased is a protein encoded by a nucleic acid comprising a nucleotide sequence with at least 90% sequence identity to one of SEQ ID NOs: 1, 3 or 5.

Detailed  Description  of  the   Invention<br>
The following definitions are set forth to clarify aspects of the invention: SPECIFIC OR SELECTIVE: a nucleic acid used in a reaction, such as a probe used in a hybridization reaction, a primer used in a PCR, or a nucleic acid present in a pharmaceutical preparation, is referred to as "selective" if it hybridizes or reacts with the intended target more frequently, more rapidly, or with greater duration than it does with alternative substances. Similarly, a polypeptide is referred to as "selective" if it binds an intended target, such as a ligand, hapten, substrate, antibody, or other polypeptide more frequently, more rapidly, or with greater duration than it does to alternative substances. An antibody is referred to as "selective" if it binds via at least one antigen recognition site to the intended target more frequently, more rapidly, or with greater duration than it does to alternative substances. A marker is selective to a particular cell or tissue type if it is expressed predominantly in or on that cell or tissue type, particularly with respect to a biological  sample  of  interest.<br>
VARIANT (S) : A variant (v) of polynucleotides or polypeptides, as the term is used herein, are polynucleotides or polypeptides that are different from a reference polynucleotide or polypeptide, respectively. Variant polynucleotides are generally limited so that the nucleotide   sequence   of   the   reference   and   the   variant   are<br>
closely related overall and, in many regions, identical. Changes in the nucleotide sequence of the variant may be silent. That is, they may not alter the amino acid sequence encoded by the polynucleotide. Where alterations are limited to silent changes of this type a variant will encode a polypeptide with the same amino acid sequence as the reference. Alternatively, changes in the nucleotide sequence of the variant may alter the amino acid sequence of a polypeptide encoded by the reference polynucleotide. Such nucleotide changes may result in amino acid substitutions, additions, deletions, fusions, and truncations in the polypeptide encoded by the reference sequence. Variant polypeptides are generally limited so that the sequences of the reference and the variant are closely similar overall and, in many regions, identical. For example, a variant and reference polypeptide may differ in amino acid sequence by one or more substitutions, additions, deletions, fusions, and truncations, which may be present or absent in any combination.<br>
CORRESPOND OR CORRESPONDING: Between nucleic acids, "corresponding" means homologous to or complementary to a particular sequence or portion of the sequence of a nucleic acid. As between nucleic acids and polypeptides, "corresponding" refers to amino acids of a peptide in an order derived from the sequence or portion of the sequence of a nucleic acid or its complement. As between polypeptides (or peptides and polypeptides), "corresponding" refers to amino acids of a first polypeptide (or peptide) in an order derived from the sequence or portion of the sequence of a second  polypeptide.<br>
NCAM-180   GENE:   As  used  herein,   unless   otherwise   indicated, refers  to  the  novel  NCAM  splice  variant  discovered  herein  to<br>
be  up-regulated  in   certain   cancers   (e.g.,   lung  cancer)   and subsets   thereof.<br>
NCAM-180 PRODUCT or NCAM-180 GENE PRODUCT: As used herein, unless otherwise indicated, an NCAM-180 product is: an RNA corresponding to one of SEQ ID NOs: 1, 3 or 5, or a nucleic acid derived therefrom; a protein comprising one of SEQ ID NOs: 2, 4 or 6; a nucleic acid comprising a sequence hybridizable to one of SEQ ID NOs: 1, 3 or 5 or a complement thereof under conditions of high stringency, or a protein comprising a sequence encoded by said hybridizable sequence; a nucleic acid at least 90% homologous to one of SEQ ID NOs: 1, 3 or 5 or a complement thereof as determined using the NBLAST algorithm; a nucleic acid at least 90% homologous to one of SEQ ID NO.: 1 or a fragment or derivative of any of the foregoing proteins or nucleic acids, in particular Exonl8_MUM a fragment of NCAM-180, hereinafter also referred to as MUM protein or NCAM-MUM, encoded by any of SEQ ID NOs.:3 or SEQ ID NO.: 5. In an even further embodiment a fragment of said NCAM-180 or Exonl8_MUM is characterized in that it comprises from 5 to 30 amino acids, more in particular from 9 to 15 amino acids and comprises an epitope selected from PAASNLSSSVLAN (AA101-113 of SEQ ID NO:2), VLSPSAPAGVG (AA 117-127 of SEQ ID N0:2), LAAAAAPATEAPQ (AA 153-165 of SEQ ID N0:2), KGPDPEPTQPGA (AA 174-185 of SEQ ID NO:2) and DFKMDEGNFK (AA 216-225 of SEQ ID NO:2). CONTROL ELEMENTS: As used herein refers collectively to promoter regions, polyadenylation signals, transcription termination sequences, upstream regulatory domains, origins of replication, internal ribosome entry sites (::IRES"), enhancers, and the like, which collectively provide for the replication, transcription and translation of a coding sequence   in   a   recipient   cell.    Not   all   of   these   control<br>
elements is required so long as the selected coding sequence is capable of being replicated, transcribed and translated in  an  appropriate  host  cell.<br>
PROMOTER REGION: Is used herein in its ordinary sense to refer to a nucleotide region comprising a DNA regulatory sequence, wherein the regulatory sequence is derived from a gene which is capable of binding RNA polymerase and initiating transcription of a downstream (3'-direction) coding  sequence.<br>
OPERABLY LINKED: As used herein refers to an arrangement of elements wherein the components so described are configured so as to perform their usual function. Thus, control elements operably linked to a coding sequence are capable of effecting the expression of the coding sequence. The control elements need not be contiguous with the coding sequence, so long as they function to direct the expression thereof. EXOGENOUS: As used herein the term exogenous refers to that which is derived or originated externally. When used in the context of exogenous expression of a gene or protein, the term refers to a gene or protein that is being expressed in a cell or tissue that does not normally express the gene or protein. When used in the context of nucleic acid sequences, for example, the term may also be used to refer to an association of two or more nucleic acid sequences that have been operably linked, but are not normally operably linked in  a  native  state.<br>
TO TREAT A CANCER OR A TUMOR: As used herein, the phrase "to treat a cancer or a tumor" or "treating a cancer or a tumor" in a mammal means one or more of alleviating a symptom of, correcting an underlying molecular or physiological disorder of, or reducing the frequency or severity of a pathological or   deleterious   physiological   consequence   of   a   cancer   or   a<br>
tumor  in  a  mammal.   By  way  of  example,   and  not  by  limitation, the  deleterious  physiological  consequences  of  a  cancer  or  a tumor  can  include  uncontrolled proliferation,  metastasis  and invasion   of   other   tissues,    and   suppression   of   an    immune response.<br>
IMMUNOLOGICALLY SPECIFIC: With respect to antibodies of the invention, the term "immunologically specific" refers to antibodies that bind to one or more epitopes of a protein of interest (e.g., Exonl8_MUM protein), but which do not substantially recognize and bind other molecules in a sample containing a mixed population of antigenic biological molecules.<br>
CONSISTING ESSENTIALLY OF: The phrase "consisting essentially of" when referring to a particular nucleotide or amino acid means a sequence having the properties of a given SEQ ID NO:. For example, when used in reference to an amino acid sequence, the phrase includes the sequence per se and molecular modifications that would not affect the basic and novel characteristics of the sequence. Such an amino acid sequence exhibits 80% sequence homology or greater, i.e. 85%, 90%, 95%, 97%, 98%, 99% or more to that of the given SEQ ID NO: . In particular such an amino acid sequence exhibits 80% sequence identity or greater, i.e. 85%, 90%, 95%, 97%, 98%, 99% or more to that of the given SEQ ID NO:. ANTAGONIST: As used herein, a compound capable of reducing the level and/or activity of NCAM-180 or a variant thereof may be referred to herein as an NCAM-180 antagonist. AGONIST: As used herein, a compound capable of increasing the level and/or activity of NCAM-180 or a variant thereof may be referred to herein as an NCAM-180 agonist. NCAM-180 ACTIVITY: As used herein, the terms "NCAM-180 activity",       "NCAM-180      product      activity",      or      "NCAM-180<br>
mediated activity" refer to an acitivity associated with the expression of NCAM-180 and/or an NCAM-180 product. Such activities include, but are not limited to changes in cellular proliferation, cellular motility, cellular differentiation, and/or cellular adhesion associated with changes in NCAM-180 expression levels. As used herein the terms "elevated", "over-expressed", "up-regulated", or "increased" refer to an approximately two-fold or greater increase in the expression of NCAM-180 transcript and/or protein as compared to that of a control tissue, which expresses   a  baseline   level   of  NCAM-180.<br>
Nucleic  acid<br>
Nucleic acid as used in the methods of the present invention includes DNA (including both genomic and cDNA)and RNA. Where nucleic acid according to the invention includes RNA, reference to the sequences shown in the accompanying listings should be construed as reference to the RNA equivalent,   with  U  substituted  for  T.<br>
Nucleic acid of the invention may be single or double<br>
stranded. Single stranded nucleic acids of the invention<br>
include     anti-sense     nucleic     acids.	Thus     it     will     be<br>
understood that reference to SEQ ID N0:1 or sequences comprising SEQ ID N0:1 or fragments thereof include complementary sequences unless the context is clearly to the contrary.     The  same  applies  to  SEQ  ID  NOs:3  or  5.<br>
Generally, nucleic acid according to the present invention is  provided  as  an  isolate,   in  isolated  and/or  purified  form,<br>
or free or substantially free of material with which it is naturally associated, such as free or substantially free of nucleic acid flanking the gene in the human genome, except possibly one or more regulatory sequence (s) for expression. Nucleic acid may be wholly or partially synthetic and may include  genomic   DNA,   cDNA  or  RNA.<br>
The  invention  also  provides  nucleic  acids  that  are fragments  of  the  nucleic  acids  encoding  a  polypeptide  of the  invention.     In  one  aspect,   the  invention  provides nucleic  acids  primers  or  probes  which  consist  essentially of  from  15   to  50,   for  example  from'15  to  35,   18   to  35,   15 to  24,   18   to   30,   18   to  21   or  21   to  24   nucleotides  of  a sequence  encoding  a  polypeptide  of  the  invention  or  its complement.<br>
The  term  "consist  essentially  of"   refers   to  nucleic  acids which  do  not   include  any  additional   5'   or  3'   nucleic  acid sequences.      In  a   further  aspect  of  the  invention,   nucleic acids  of  the   invention  which  consist  essentially  of  from 15  to  30  nucleotides  as  defined  above  may  however  be linked  at  the  3'   but  preferably  5'   end  to  short   (e.g  from 4  to  15,   such  as   from  4   to   10  nucleotides)   additional sequences   to  which  they  are  not  naturally  linked.     Such additional   sequences  are  preferably  linkers  which  comprise a  restriction  enzyme  recognition  site  to   facilitate cloning  when  the  nucleic  acid  of  the  invention  is  used  for example  as   a   PCR  primer.<br>
Primers  and  probes  of  the   invention  are  desirably  capable of  selectively  hybridising  to  nucleic  acids  encoding  the polypeptides   of  the   invention.     By  "selective",   it  is<br>
meant   selective  with  respect   to  sequences  encoding  other purine   receptors   and  in  particular  with  respect  to receptors  other  than  adenine  receptors.     The  ability  of the  sequence   to  hybridize  selectively  may  be  determined  by experiment  or  calculated.<br>
For  example,   one   way   to   calculate  Tm  of  a  primer  is   by reference  to  the   formula  for  calculating  the  Tm  of  primers to  a  homologous   target   sequence.     This   formula  is  Tm(°C)   = 2(A+T)   +  4(G+C)   -   5.   This  will  provide  the  Tm  under conditions  of   3xSSC  and  0.1%   SDS   (where  SSC  is   0.15M  NaCl, 0.015M  sodium  citrate,   pH  7).     This   formula   is  generally suitable   for  primers   of  up  to  about   50  nucleotides   in length.     In  the  present   invention,   this   formula  may  be used  as  an  algorithm  to  calculate  a  nominal   Tm  of  a  primer for  a  specified  sequence  derived  from  a  sequence  encoding a  polypeptide  of  the   invention.     The  Tm  may  be  compared  to a  calculated  Tm  for  GPCR  sequences  of  humans  and  rats, based  upon  the  maximum  number  of  matches  to  any  part  of these  other  sequences.<br>
Suitable  conditions   for  a  primer  to  hybridize  to  a  target sequence  may  also  be  measured  experimentally.      Suitable experimental   conditions   comprise  hybridising  a  candidate primer  to  both  nucleic  acid  encoding  a  polypeptide  of  the invention  and  nucleic  acid  encoding  other  adenine receptors  on  a  solid  support  under  low  stringency hybridising  conditions    (e.g.   6xSSC  at   55°C),   washing  at reduced  SSC  and/or  higher  temperature,   for  example  at 0.2xSSC  at  45°C,   and  increasing  the  hybridisation temperature  incrementally  to  determine  hybridisation conditions  which  allow  the  primer  to  hybridize  to  nucleic<br>
acid  encoding  a  polypeptide  of  the  invention  but  not  other purine  receptor  encoding  nucleic   acids.<br>
Nucleic  acids  of  the   invention,   particularly  probes,   may carry  a  revealing  label.     Suitable   labels   include radioisotopes  such  as  32P  or  35S,    fluorescent  labels, enzyme  labels,   or  other  protein  labels  such  as  biotin. Such  labels  may  be  added  to  polynucleotides  or  primers  of the  invention  and  may  be  detected  using  by  techniques known  per  se.<br>
Primers  of   the  present   invention  may  be   comprised  of synthetic  nucleic   acids,   such  as   those  with  modified backbone  structures   intended  to  improve   stability  of  the nucleic  acid  in  a  cell.     A  number  of  different  types  of modification   to  oligonucleotides   are  known  in  the  art. These  include  methylphosphonate  and  phosphorothioate backbones,   addition  of  acridine  or  polylysine  chains  at the   3'   and/or   5'   ends  of  the  molecule.     For  the  purposes of  the  present  invention,   it  is   to  be  understood  that  the polynucleotides  described  herein  may  be  modified  by  any method  available   in  the  art.     Such  modifications  may  be carried  out   in  order  to  enhance  the  in  vivo  activity  or lifespan  of  polynucleotides  of  the  invention.<br>
Also  included  within  the   scope  of  the  invention  are antisense   sequences  based  on  the  nucleic  acid  sequences described  herein,   preferably  in  the  form  of oligonucleotides,   particularly  stabilized oligonucleotides,   or  ribozymes.<br>
Antisense  oligonucleotides  may  be  designed  to  hybridize  to<br>
the   complementary   sequence   of  nucleic  acid,   pre-mRNA  or mature  mRNA,   interfering  with  the  production  of polypeptide  encoded  by  a  given  target  DNA  sequence,   so that   its  expression   is  reduced  or  prevented  altogether. Ribozymes  will  be  designed  to  cleave  mRNA  encoded  by  an NCAM-180  encoding  nucleic  acid  sequence  of  the   invention, desirably  at  a  target  sequence  specific  to  the  NCAM-180 gene  products  as  defined  hereinbefore,   including  sequences according  to  SEQ   ID  Nos.:   1,   3  or  5.     The  construction  of antisense   sequences   and  their  use   is  described  in  Peyman and  Ulman,   Chemical   Reviews,   90:543-584,    (1990),   Crooke, Ann.      Rev.   Pharmacol.     Toxicol.;   32:329-376,    (1992),   and Zamecnik  and  Stephenson,   P.N.A.S,   75:280-284,    (1974).      The construction   of   ribozymes   and  their  use   is  described  in for  instance  Gibson  and  Shillitoe,   Molecular  Biotechnology 7(2)  :   125-137,    (1997) .<br>
The  cDNA  sequence   of  the  NCAM-180  of  the   invention  may  be cloned  using  standard  PCR   (polymerase  chain  reaction) cloning  techniques.      This   involves  making  a  pair   of primers   to   5'   and   3'   ends   on  opposite   strands   of   SEQ   ID NO:l,   bringing  the   primers   into  contact   with  mRNA  or  cDNA obtained  from  a  mammalian  cell,   performing  a  polymerase chain  reaction  under  conditions  which  bring  about amplification  of  the  desired  region,   isolating  the amplified  fragment   (e.g.   by  purifying  the  reaction  mixture on  an  agarose  gel)   and  recovering  the  amplified  DNA.     The primers  may  be  designed  co  contain  suitable  restriction enzyme   recognition   sites   so   that   the  amplified  DNA  can  be cloned  into  a  suitable  cloning  vector.      The  same   applies to  SEQ   ID  NOs:3   or   5.<br>
Polynucleotides  which  are  not   100%  homologous   to  the sequence  of  SEQ  ID  NOs:   1,   3  or  5  but  which  encode  either SEQ  ID  NOs:2,   4   or   6  or  other  polypeptides  of  the invention  can  be  obtained  in  a  number  of  ways.<br>
For  example,   site  directed  mutagenesis  of  the   sequence  of SEQ  ID  NO:   1,   3  or  5  may  be  performed.     This   is  useful where  for  example   silent  codon  changes   are  required  to sequences   to  optimise   codon  preferences   for  a  particular host  cell   in  which  the  polynucleotide   sequences   are  being expressed.     Other   sequence  changes  may  be  desired  in  order to  introduce  restriction  enzyme  recognition  sites,   or  to alter  the  property  or  function  of  the  polypeptides  encoded by  the  polynucleotides.   Further  changes  may  be  desirable to  represent  particular  coding  changes  which  are  required to  provide,   for  example,   conservative   substitutions.<br>
Nucleic  acids  of   the  invention  may  comprise  additional sequences  at  the   5'   or  3'   end.     For  example,   synthetic  or natural   5'   leader  sequences  may  be  attached  to   the  nucleic acid  encoding  polypeptides  of  the  invention.     The additional   sequences  may  also  include   5'   or  3' untranslated  regions  required  for  the  transcription  of nucleic  acid  of  the  invention   in  particular  host  cells.<br>
In  addition,   other  animal,   particularly  mammalian   (e.g. monkey  or   rabbits),   more  particularly  primate   including monkey,   homologues   of  NCAM-180  may  be   obtained  and  used   in the  methods  of  the  present  invention.     Such  sequences  may be  obtained  by  making  or  obtaining  cDNA  libraries  made from  dividing  cells  or  tissues  or  genomic  DNA  libraries from  other  animal   species,   and  probing  such  libraries  with<br>
probes   comprising   all   or  part   of  SEQ   ID  N0:1,    3   or   5   under conditions  of  medium  to  high  stringency   (for  example   0.03M sodium  chloride  and  0.03M  sodium  citrate  at   from  about 50  C   to  about   60  C)  .<br>
The  present   invention  further  extends   to  an   isolated  DNA sequence  comprising  sequences  encoding  a  polypeptide  of the  invention  but   in  which  the  encoding  sequences  are divided  up  into  two  or  more   (preferably  no  more  than  five, e.g.   four  or  three)   exons.     Such  exon  sequences  may  be natural  and  obtained  from  genomic  clones,   or  synthetic. Exon  sequences  may  be  used  in  the  construction  of  mini-gene   sequences   which   comprise   nucleic   acid  encoding polypeptides   of  the   invention  which  sequences  are interrupted  by  one  or  more  exon  sequences.<br>
Mini-genes  may  also  be  constructed  using  heterologous exons,   derived  from  any  eukaryotic   source.<br>
Polypeptides.<br>
Isolated  polypeptides  used  in  the  methods  of  the  present invention  will  be  those  as  defined  above  in  isolated  form, free  or  substantially  free  of  material  with  which  it  is naturally  associated  such  as  other  polypeptides  with  which it  is   found  in  the  cell.     The  polypeptides  may  of  course be   formulated  with  diluents   or  adjuvants  and  still   for practical  purposes  be  isolated  -   for  example  the polypeptides  will  normally  be  mixed  with  gelatin  or  other carriers  if  used  to  coat  microtitre  plates   for  use  in immunoassays.     The  polypeptides  may  be  glycosylated,<br>
either  naturally  or  by  systems  of  heterologous  eukaryotic cells,   or  they  may  be   (for  example  if  produced  by expression  in  a  prokaryotic  cell)   unglycosylated. Polypeptides  may  be  phosphorylated  and/or  acetylated.<br>
A  polypeptide   of   the   invention  may  also  be   in  a substantially  purified   form,   in  which  case   it  will generally  comprise  the  polypeptide  in  a  preparation  in which  more  than  90%,   e.g.   95%,   98%  or  99%  of  the polypeptide   in  the  preparation   is  a  polypeptide  of  the invention.<br>
Polypeptides   of   the   invention  may  be  modified  for  example by  the  addition  of  histidine  residues  to  assist  their purification  or  by  the  addition  of  a  signal   sequence  to promote  their   secretion   from  a  cell.<br>
In  one  embodiment,   the  present   invention  relates  to   fusion proteins,   comprising   the  NCAM-180  polypeptides,   fragments or  derivatives  of  the  present   invention  and  a  heterologous protein  or  part  of  a  protein  acting  as  a  fusion  partner. The  proteins  of  the  present   invention  and  the  fusion partner  may  be  chemically  conjugated,   but  are  preferably expressed  as   recombinant   fusion  proteins   in  a  heterologous expression  system.     The  fusion  partner  can  either  be  an immunological   fusion  partner   that  may  assist   in  providing T  helper  epitopes,   or  act  as  an  expression  enhancer.     Thus the   immunological   fusion  protein  may  act   through  a bystander  helper  effect   linked  to   the   secretion  of activation  signals  by  a  large  number  of  T-cells  specific to  the   foreign  protein  or  peptide,   thereby  enhancing  the induction  of   immunity  to  the  NCAM-180  protein.     Preferably<br>
the  heterologous  partner  is  selected  to  be  recognized  by T-cells  in  a  majority  of  humans.     The  expression  enhancer will  allow  increased  levels  of  NCAM-180  protein  to  be produced  as  compared  to  the  native  recombinant  protein  and include   chaperones  that  assist   folding  of  nascent proteins,   in  particular  the  HSP70  or  HSP60   families  and the  C-terminal   domains   of  said  heat   shock  proteins   which are  known  to  interact  with  substrate  proteins   and immunogenic  peptides.     Preferably  the  fusion  partner  will be  both  an   immunological   fusion  protein  and  an  expression enhancer  partner.     Accordingly,   the  present  invention provides   fusion  proteins  of  the  NCAM-180  proteins, fragments  or  derivatives  according  to  the  invention, linked  to  a  fusion  partner.     In  a  further  embodiment   the fusion  partner  is   selected  from  the  group  consisting  of the  non-structural  protein  from  influenza  virus,   NS1 (hemagglutinin)   or  the  C-terminal  domains  of  the  HSP70  or HSP60   families.     Further  examples  of  immunological   fusion partners  are  provided  in  EP  804   156.<br>
Polypeptides  having  at  least  50%,   for  example   60%,   70%, 80%,   90%,    95%   or   98%   sequence   identity   to  SEQ   ID  NO:2,   SEQ ID  NO:   4   or  SEQ  ID  NO:6  may  be  polypeptides  which  are amino  acid  sequence  variants,   alleles,   derivatives  or mutants   of  SEQ   ID  NO:2,   SEQ   ID  NO:   4   or   SEQ   ID  NO:6 respectively,   and  are  also  provided  by  the  present invention.      For  example  such  a  polypeptide  may  have  an amino  acid  sequence  which  differs   from  that  given   in   SEQ ID  NO:2,   SEQ   ID  NO:   4   or  SEQ   ID  NO:6  by  one  or  more  of addition,   substitution,   deletion  and  insertion  of  one  or more   (such  as   from  I   to  20,   for  example  2,   3,   4,   or  5   to 10)   amino   acids.<br>
The  percentage  identity  of  polypeptide  sequences   can  be calculated  using  commercially  available  algorithms  which compare  a   reference   sequence   (e.g.   SEQ  ID  NO:2,   SEQ  ID  NO: 4  or  SEQ  ID  NO:6  of  the  present  invention)   with  a  query sequence.     Further  details   of  assessing  identity  are described  below.<br>
Where  a  query  sequence  is  determined  to  have  an  identity to  that  of  SEQ  ID  NO:2,   SEQ  ID  NO:   4   or  SEQ  ID  NO:6  of  at least   50%  and  preferably  at   least   60%,   70%,   80%,   90%,   95% or   98%  said  sequence  being  that  of  a  polypeptide   retaining NCAM-180  protein  activity,   such  a  sequence   forms  part  of the  present   invention.<br>
A  polypeptide  according  to   the  present   invention  may  be isolated  and/or  purified   (e.g.   using  an  antibody)   for instance  after  production  by  expression   from  encoding nucleic  acid.     The   isolated  and/or  purified  polypeptide may  be  used  in  formulation  of  a  composition,   which  may include  at   least  one  additional  component,   for  example  a pharmaceutical  composition   including  a  pharmaceutically acceptable  excipient,   vehicle  or  carrier.<br>
A  polypeptide  according  to  the  present   invention  may  be used  as  an   immunogen  or  otherwise   in  obtaining  specific antibodies.     Antibodies  are  useful   in  purification  and other  manipulation   of  polypeptides,   diagnostic   screening and  therapeutic  contexts.<br>
A  polypeptide  of  the   invention  may  be  labelled  with  a revealing  label.     The  revealing  label  may  be  any  suitable<br>
label   which  allows  the  polypeptide   to  be  detected. Suitable  labels   include  radioisotopes,   e.g.   125I, fluorochromes,   enzymes,   antibodies,   polynucleotides  and linkers   such   as  biotin.      Labelled  polypeptides   of   the invention  may  be  used  in  diagnostic  procedures   such  as immunoassays   in  order  to  determine  the  amount  of  a polypeptide  of  the  invention  in  a   sample.      Polypeptides  or labelled  polypeptides  of  the  invention  may  also  be  used  in serological  or  cell  mediated  immune   assays   for  the detection  of  immune  reactivity  to  said  polypeptides   in animals  and  humans  using  standard  protocols.<br>
A  polypeptide  or  labelled  polypeptide  of  the   invention  or fragment  thereof  may  also  be  fixed  to  a  solid  phase,   for example  the  surface  of  an  immunoassay  well   or  dipstick.<br>
Such   labelled  and/or   immobilized  polypeptides  may  be packaged  into  kits  in  a  suitable  container  along  with suitable  reagents,   controls,   instructions  and  the  like.<br>
Such  polypeptides  and  kits  may  be  used  in  methods   of detection  of  antibodies  to  such  polypeptides  present   in  a sample  or  active  portions  or  fragments  thereof  by immunoassay.<br>
Immunoassay  methods  are  well  known   in  the  art  and  will generally  comprise:<br>
(a)	providing  a  polypeptide   comprising  an  epitope bindable  by  an  antibody  against  said  protein;<br>
(b)	incubating  a  biological  sample  with  said polypeptide  under  conditions  which  allow  for  the formation  of  an  antibody-antigen  complex;   and<br>
 (c)     determining  whether  antibody-antigen  complex comprising  said  polypeptide   is   formed.<br>
Sequence  Identity<br>
The  percentage  identity  of  nucleic  acid  and  polypeptide sequences   can  be  calculated  using  commercially  available algorithms  which  compare  a  reference  sequence  with  a  query sequence.     The   following  programs   (provided  by  the National  Center  for  Biotechnology  Information)   may  be  used to  determine  homologies/identities:   BLAST,   gapped  BLAST, BLASTN  and  PSI-BLAST,   which  may  be  used  with  default parameters.<br>
The  algorithm  GAP   (Genetics  Computer  Group,   Madison,   WI) uses   the  Needleman  and  Wunsch  algorithm  to   align  two complete   sequences   that  maximizes  the  number  of  matches and  minimizes  the  number  of  gaps.     Generally,   the  default parameters  are  used,   with  a  gap  creation  penalty  =   12   and gap  extension  penalty  =  4.<br>
Another  method  for  determining  the  best  overall  match between  a  nucleic  acid  sequence  or  a  portion  thereof,   and a  query  sequence   is   the  use  of  the  FASTDB  computer  program based  on  the  algorithm  of  Brutlag  et  al   (Comp.   App. Biosci.,   6;   237-245   (1990)).     The  program  provides  a global  sequence  alignment.     The   result  of  said  global sequence   alignment   is   in  percent   identity.      Suitable parameters  used  in  a  FASTDB  search  of  a  DNA  sequence  to calculate  percent  identity  are:   Matrix=Unitary,   k-tuple=4, Mismatch  penalty=l,   Joining  Penalty=30.   Randomization Group  Length=0,   Cutoff  Score=l,   Gap  Penalty=5,   Gap  Size<br>
Penalty=0.05,   and  Window  Size=500  or  query  sequence  length in  nucleotide  bases,   whichever  is  shorter.     Suitable parameters   to  calculate  percent   identity  and  similarity  of an  amino  acid  alignment  are:   Matrix=PAM  150,   k-tuple=2, Mismatch   Penalty=l,   Joining   Penalty=20,   Randomization Group  Length=0,   Cutoff  Score=l,   Gap  Penalty=5,   Gap  Size Penalty=0.05,   and  Window  Size=500  or  query  sequence  length in  nucleotide  bases,   whichever  is   shorter.<br>
Vectors<br>
Nucleic  acid  sequences  of  the  present  invention  may  be incorporated  into  vectors,   particularly  expression vectors.     The  vector  may  be  used  to  replicate  the  nucleic acid  in  a  compatible  host  cell.     Thus   in  a  further embodiment,   the   invention  provides   a  method  of  making polynucleotides   of   the   invention  by   introducing  a polynucleotide  of  the  invention  into  a   replicable  vector, introducing  the  vector  into  a  compatible  host  cell,   and growing  the  host   cell  under  conditions   which  bring  about replication  of  the  vector.     The  vector  may  be   recovered from  the  host  cell.     Suitable  host  cells  are  described below  in  connection  with  expression  vectors.<br>
Preferably, a polynucleotide of the invention in a vector is operably linked to a control sequence which is capable of providing for the expression of the coding sequence by the  host  cell,   i.e.   the  vector  is  an  expression  vector.<br>
The  term  "operably  linked"   refers  to  a   juxtaposition wherein  the  components  described  are   in  a  relationship<br>
permitting  them  to  function  in  their  intended  manner.     A control   sequence   "operably  linked"   to  a   coding  sequence   is ligated  in  such  a  way  that  expression  of  the  coding sequence  is  achieved  under  condition  compatible  with  the control  sequences.<br>
Suitable  vectors   can  be  chosen  or  constructed,   containing appropriate  regulatory  sequences,   including  promoter sequences,   terminator  fragments,   polyadenylation sequences,   enhancer  sequences,   marker  genes  and  other sequences  as  appropriate.     Vectors  may  be  plasmids,   viral e.g.   phage,   phagemid  or  baculoviral,   cosmids,   YACs,   BACs, or   PACs  as  appropriate.     Vectors   include  gene  therapy vectors,   for  example  vectors  based  on  adenovirus,   adeno-associated  virus,   retrovirus   (such  as  HIV  or  MLV)   or   alpha virus  vectors.<br>
The  vectors  may  be  provided  with  an  origin  of  replication, optionally  a  promoter  for  the  expression  of  the  said polynucleotide  and  optionally  a  regulator  of  the  promoter. The  vectors  may  contain  one  or  more  selectable  marker genes,   for  example  an  ampicillin   resistance  gene  in  the case  of  a  bacterial  plasmid  or  a  neomycin  resistance  gene for  a  mammalian  vector.     Vectors  may  be  used  in  vitro,   for example   for  the  production  of  RNA  or  used  to  transfect   or transform  a  host  cell.     The  vector  may  also  be  adapted  to be  used  in   vivo,   for  example  in  methods  of  gene  therapy. Systems   for  cloning  and  expression   of  a  polypeptide   in   a variety  of  different  host  cells  are  well   known.   Suitable host  cells  include  bacteria,   eukaryotic  cells  such  as mammalian  and  yeast,   and  baculovirus  systems.     Mammalian cell   lines  available   in  the  art   for  expression  of  a<br>
heterologous  polypeptide  include  Chinese  hamster  ovary cells,   HeLa  cells,   baby  hamster  kidney  cells,   COS  cells and  many  others.<br>
Promoters   and  other  expression   regulation  signals  may  be selected  to  be  compatible  with  the  host  cell   for  which  the expression  vector  is  designed.     For  example,   yeast promoters   include  S.      cerevisiae  GAL4  and  ADH  promoters, S.     pombe  nmtl  and  adh  promoter.     Mammalian  promoters include  the  metallothionein  promoter  which  can  be  induced in  response  to  heavy  metals   such  as  cadmium.     Viral promoters   such  as   the  SV4 0   large  T  antigen  promoter  or adenovirus  promoters  may  also  be  used.     All   these promoters   are   readily  available   in  the  art.<br>
The  vectors  may  include  other  sequences   such  as  promoters or  enhancers   to  drive   the  expression  of  the  inserted nucleic  acid,   nucleic  acid  sequences  so  that  the polypeptide   is  produced  as  a   fusion  and/or  nucleic  acid encoding  secretion  signals   so  that  the  polypeptide produced  in  the  host   cell   is   secreted  from  the  cell.<br>
Vectors   for  production  of  polypeptides  of  the  invention  of for  use   in  gene  therapy  include  vectors  which  carry  a mini-gene  sequence  of  the  invention.<br>
For  further  details  see,   for  example,   Molecular  Cloning:   a Laboratory  Manual:   2nd  edition,   Sambrook  et   al.,   1989, Cold  Spring  Harbor  Laboratory  Press.     Many  known techniques  and  protocols  for  manipulation  of  nucleic  acid, for  example   in  preparation  of  nucleic  acid  constructs, mutagenesis,   sequencing,   introduction  of  DNA  into  cells<br>
and  gene  expression,   and  analysis  of  proteins,   are described  in  detail   in  Current   Protocols   in  Molecular Biology,   Ausubel  et  al.   eds.,   John  Wiley  &amp;   Sons,   1992.<br>
Vectors  may  be  transformed  into  a  suitable  host  cell  as described  above  to  provide   for  expression  of  a  polypeptide of  the   invention.        Thus,   in  a  further  aspect  the invention  provides  a  process   for  preparing  polypeptides according  to  the   invention  which  comprises   cultivating  a host  cell  transformed  or  transfected  with  an  expression vector  as  described  above  under  conditions  to  provide  for expression  by  the  vector  of  a  coding  sequence  encoding  the polypeptides,   and  recovering  the  expressed  polypeptides. Polypeptides  may  also  be  expressed  in  vitro  systems,   such as  reticulocyte  lysate.<br>
A  further  embodiment   of   the   invention  provides  host   cells transformed  or  transfected  with  the  vectors   for  the replication  and  expression  of  polynucleotides  of  the invention.     The  cells  will  be  chosen  to  be  compatible  with the   said  vector  and  may   for   example  be  bacterial,   yeast, insect  or  mammalian.     The  host  cells  may  be  cultured  under conditions   for  expression  of  the  gene,   so  that  the  encoded polypeptide  is  produced.     If  the  polypeptide  is  expressed coupled  to  an  appropriate  signal  leader  peptide  it  may  be secreted  from  the  cell  into  the  culture  medium.     Following production  by  expression,   a  polypeptide  may  be  isolated and/or  purified  from  the  host  cell  and/or  culture  medium, as  the   case  may  be,   and  subsequently  used  as  desired,   e.g. in  the   formulation  of  a  composition  which  may  include  one or  more  additional  components,   such  as  a  pharmaceutical composition  which  includes   one  or  more  pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable  excipients,   vehicles  or  carriers<br>
Polynucleotides  according  to  the  invention  may  also  be inserted  into  the  vectors  described  above  in  an  antisense orientation  in  order  to  provide   for  the  production  of antisense  RNA  or  ribozymes.<br>
Diagnostic  Methods<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the invention involves methods to assess quantitative and qualitative aspects of NCAM-180 gene expression. In one example the increased expression of an NCAM-180 gene or gene product as provided by the present invention are indicative of the presence of cancer in a subject or the risk of metastasis of a cancer in said subject. Techniques well known in the art, e.g., quantitative or semi-quantitative RT PCR or Northern blot, can  be  used  to  measure  expression  levels  of  NCAM-180.<br>
The measurement of NCAM-180 gene expression levels may include measuring naturally occurring NCAM-180 transcripts and variants thereof as well as non-naturally occurring variants thereof. The diagnosis and/or prognosis of cancer in a subject, however is preferably directed to detecting a naturally occurring NCAM-180 gene product or variant thereof. Thus, the invention relates to methods of diagnosing and/or predicting cancer in a subject by measuring the expression of an NCAM-180 gene in a subject. For example an increased level of mRNA encoded by an NCAM-180  nucleic  acid  sequence   (e.g.,   SEQ  ID  NO:   1,   3  or  5).<br>
Diagnostic   methods   for   the   detection   of   NCAM-180   nucleic<br>
acid molecules, in patient samples or other appropriate cell sources, may involve the amplification of specific gene sequences, e.g., by PCR (SeeMullis, K. B., 1987, U. S. Patent No.4, 683,202), followed by the analysis of the amplified molecules using techniques well known to those of skill in the art, such as, for example, those listed above. Utilizing analysis techniques such as these, amplified sequences  can  be  compared  to  the  levels  in  control  samples.<br>
The diagnosis and/or prognosis of cancer pertain to the detection of naturally occurring NCAM-180 polypeptides in a subject. Detection of an NCAM-180 polypeptide may be by any method  known  in  the  art.<br>
The tissue or cell type to be analyzed generally includes those which are known, or suspected, to express the NCAM-180 gene, such as, for example, cancer cells including lung cancer cells, ovarian cancer cells, skin cancer cells, lymphoid cancer cells, and metastatic forms thereof. The protein isolation methods employed herein may, for example, be such as those described in Harlow and Lane (Harlow, E. and Lane, D. , 1988, Antibodies : A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, New York). The isolated cells can be derived from cell culture or  from  a  patient.<br>
Preferred diagnostic methods for the detection of NCAM-180 gene products or conserved variants or peptide fragments thereof, in particular Exonl8_MUM, may involve, for example, immunoassays wherein the NCAM-180 gene products or variants thereof, including peptide fragments such as Exonl8_MUM are detected by  their  interaction  with  selective  antibodies.  For<br>
example, antibodies, or fragments of antibodies, may be used to quantitatively or qualitatively detect the presence of NCAM-180 encoded polypeptides or naturally occurring variants or peptide fragments thereof. The antibodies (or fragments thereof) useful in the present invention may, additionally, be employed histologically, as in immunofluorescence or immunoelectron microscopy, for in situ detection of NCAM-180 gene products or conserved variants or peptide fragments thereof. In situ detection may be accomplished by removing a histological specimen from a subject, such as paraffin embedded sections of tissue, e.g., lung tissue, and applying thereto a labeled antibody of the present invention. The antibody (or fragment) is preferably applied by overlaying the labeled antibody (or fragment) onto a biological sample. Since the NCAM-180 fragment Exonl8_MUM appears to be expressed predominantly as an intracellular protein, it may be desirable to introduce the antibody into the cell, for example, by making the cell membrane permeable. Some of the NCAM-180 immunogenic polypeptides may also be expressed on the cell surface, thus cells can be directly labeled by applying antibodies that are specific or selective for the extracellular NCAM-180 polypeptides  or  fragment   thereof.<br>
Through the use of such a procedure, it is possible to determine not only the presence of the NCAM-180 gene product, or naturally occurring variants thereof or peptide fragments, but also its distribution in the examined tissue. Using the methods of the present invention, those of ordinary skill will readi ly perceive that any of a wide variety of histological methods (such as staining procedures)   can  be  modified  in  order  to  achieve  such  in  situ<br>
detection.<br>
Immunoassays for NCAM-180 encoded polypeptides or conserved variants or peptide fragments thereof, in particular for Exonl8_MUM will typically comprise contacting a sample, such as a biological fluid, tissue or a tissue extract, freshly harvested cells, or lysates of cells which have been incubated in cell culture, in the presence of an antibody that specifically or selectively binds to an NCAM-180 gene product, e. g., a detectably labeled antibody capable of identifying NCAM-180 polypeptides or conserved variants or peptide fragments thereof, and detecting the bound antibody by any of a number of techniques well-known in the art (e. g. , Western blot, ELISA, FACS). The biological sample may be brought in contact with and immobilized onto a solid phase support or carrier such as nitrocellulose, or other solid support that is capable of immobilizing cells, cell particles or soluble proteins. The support is washed with suitable buffers followed by treatment with a blocking agent and the labeled antibody that selectively or specifically binds to an NCAM-180 encoded polypeptide. The solid phase support is washed with buffer a second time to remove unbound antibody. The amount of bound label on a solid support may be detected by conventional means. Alternatively, the antibody that selectively or specifically binds to an NCAM-180 encoded polypeptide is immobilized, and the  biological  sample  comprising  an<br>
By "solid phase support or carrier" is intended any support capable of binding an antigen or an antibody. Well-known supports or carriers include glass, polystyrene, polypropylene,  polyethylene,   dextran,   nylon,   nitrocellulose,<br>
natural and modified celluloses, polyacrylamides, and magnetite. The nature of the carrier can be either soluble to some extent or insoluble for the purposes of the present invention. The support material may have virtually any possible structural configuration so long as the coupled molecule is capable of binding to an antigen or antibody. Thus, the support configuration may be spherical, as in a bead, or cylindrical, as in the inside surface of a test tube, or the external surface of a rod. Alternatively, the surface may be flat such as a sheet, test strip, etc. Preferred supports include polystyrene beads. Those skilled in the art will know many other suitable carriers for binding antibody or antigen, or will be able to ascertain the  same  by  use  of  routine  experimentation.<br>
The anti-NCAM-180 antibody can be detectably labeled by linking the same to an enzyme and using the labeled antibody in an enzyme immunoassay (EIA) (Voller, A.,"The Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA)", 1978, Diagnostic Horizons 2:1,Microbiological Associates<br>
QuarterlyPublication, Walkersville, MD) ; Voller, A. et al., 1978, J. Clin. Pathol. 31: 507-520; Butler, J. E., 1981, Meth.E4Zy7n01.   73: 482;    Maggio,  E (ed.), 1980,<br>
Enzymelmmunoassay, CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL; Ishikawa, E. et al., (eds.), 1981, Enzyme Immunoassay, Kgaku Shoin, Tokyo). The enzyme that is bound to the antibody will react with an appropriate substrate,preferably a<br>
fluoresceinisothiocyanate, rhodamine, phycoerythrin,<br>
phycocyanin, allophycocyanin, o-phthaidehyde and<br>
fluorescamine.<br>
The antibody  can  also bedetectably labeled using<br>
 <br>
fluorescence emitting metals such as 152Eu, or others of the lanthanide series. These metals are attached to an antibody using such metal chelating groups as<br>
diethylenetriaminepentacetic acid (DTPA)or<br>
ethylenediaminetetraacetic  acid  (EDTA).Fluorochromes<br>
typically used are Fluorescein, Texas Red or other fluorochromes   such  as  the  Alexa  Fluor  series.<br>
The antibody can also be detectably labeled by coupling it to a chemiluminescent compound. The presence of the chemi-luminescent-tagged antibody is detected by luminescence that arises duringthe course of a chemical reaction. Examples of particularly useful chemiluminescent labeling compounds are luminol, isoluminol, theromatic acridinium ester, imidazole, acridinium  salt  and  oxalate  ester.<br>
Likewise, a bioluminescent compound may be used to label the antibody of the present invention. Bioluminescence is a type of chemiluminescence found in biological systems in which a catalytic protein increases the efficiency of a chemiluminescent reaction. The presence of a bioluminescent protein is determined by detecting luminescence. Important bioluminescent compounds for purposes of labeling are luciferin,   luciferase  and  aequorin.<br>
In various embodiments, the present invention provides methods for the measurement of NCAM-180 polypeptides, and the uses of such measurements in clinical applications using NCAM-180-specific   or  NCAM-180-   selective  antibodies.<br>
The measurement of NCAM-180 polypeptides of the invention is valuable  for  detecting  and/or  staging  lung  cancer  and  other<br>
cancers in a subject, for screening of lung cancer and other cancers in a population, for differential diagnosis of the physiological condition of a subject, and for monitoring the effect  of  a  therapeutic  treatment   on  a  subject.<br>
The present invention also provides for detecting, diagnosing, or staging lung cancer and other cancers, or for monitoring the treatment of lung cancer and other cancers by measuring the level of expression of an NCAM-180 polypeptide. In addition to NCAM-180 polypeptides, at least one other marker, such as receptors or differentiation antigens can also be measured. For example, serum markers selected from, for example but not limited to, carcino embryonic antigen (CEA), CA15-3, CA549, CAM26, M29, CA27.29 and MCA can be measured in combination with an NCAM-180 polypeptide to detect, diagnose, stage, or monitor treatment of lung cancer and other cancers. In another embodiment, the prognostic indicator is the observed change in different marker levels relative to one another, rather than the absolute levels of the markers present at any one time. These measurements can also aid in predicting therapeutic outcome and in evaluating and monitoring the overall disease status  of  a  subject.<br>
Vaccination  Methods<br>
The invention also relates to the use of a vaccine based on NCAM-180 as a tumor-associated antigen (TAA), its epitope, mimotope, specific or anti-idiotypic antibody, for preparing a medicament, as well as to a kit for the prophylactic and/or therapeutic active immunization against cancer. Tumor-associated  antigens   (TAA)   often  are  the  basis  for  the<br>
development of immunotherapeutic agents for the prophylaxis and/or treatment of cancer. TAA are structures that enable a differentiation relative to non-malignant tissue and thus are viewed as targets for the diagnostic and therapeutic applications of specific antibodies. TAA are typically expressed on the plasma membrane of tumor cells but can also be intracellular proteins including nuclear, cytosolic and transmembrane  proteins.<br>
Direct therapeutic applications of antibodies against TAA are based on passive immunotherapies, i.e., a specific antibody is systemically (or locally, e.g. into a vein leading into the tissue) administered to cancer patients in a suitable amount and has only a therapeutic action as long as its concentration in the organism is high enough for this. The biological half-life of such agents depends on their structures and ranges from a few hours to several days. Therefore, it is necessary to provide repeated applications. When using xenogenic antibodies (e.g. murine monoclonal antibodies, MAB), this, however, will lead to undesired immune reactions which can neutralize a possible therapeutic activity and may cause dangerous side effects (anaphylactic reactions). Therefore, such immune therapeutic agents  can  be  administered  for  a  limited  time  only.<br>
A different approach for the immunotherapy of cancer is based on the selective activation of the immune system of cancer patients to fight malignant cells. This is attempted by the most varying forms of cancer vaccines. Among them are vaccinations with irradiated or otherwise inactivated (not proliferative) autologous or allogenic tumor cells or mixtures of autologous, chemically or molecular-biologically modified  autologous  or  allogenic  tumor  cells,   isolated  TAAs<br>
or TAAs prepared with the help of chemical or molecular-biological methods, peptides derived therefrom, more recently also vaccinations with DNA which codes for TAA or structures derived therefrom, etc. An alternative method is based on the use of anti-idiotypic antibodies for vaccinating against cancer. Suitable anti-idiotypic antibodies may mimic a TAA immunologically. As foreign proteins (e.g. murine antibodies, goat antibodies etc.) they induce a strong immune response in humans after a vaccination-in contrast to the human tumor antigens proper which, being self-structures, often are of only little immunogenicity. Therefore, anti-idiotypic antibodies can be used as an immunogenic substitute of a tumor antigen for vaccination  purposes.<br>
In contrast to the passive immunotherapies using anti-tumor antibodies, in principle very small amounts of a suitable vaccine might suffice for the active specific cancer immunotherapy so as to induce an immunity for months or even years which, when it becomes weaker, can be boosted by booster vaccinations. Moreover, in an active immunization both a humoral and also a cellular immunity can be induced whose  interaction  may  yield  an  effective  protective  action.<br>
Summing up, so far the use of antibodies or their derivatives in the cancer immunotherapy has essentially been based  on  two  principles:<br>
Passive therapy with antibodies or their derivatives which are directed against TAA. In this instance, tumor cells are relatively specifically destroyed (Immunology Today (2000), 21: 403-410; Curr. Opin. Immunol. (1997), 9: 717) . Active   immunization    (vaccination)   with   cells,   TAA.,<br>
or   antibodies,   respectively,    or   their   derivatives,<br>
which      are      directed     against      the      idiotype      of<br>
antibodies   having   a    specificity   against    TAA.    The<br>
active     vaccination     triggers     an     immune     response<br>
against    TAA.    This    immune    response    thus    is    also<br>
directed  against  the  corresponding  tumor  cells   (Ann.<br>
Med.    (1999),   31:   66;   Immunobiol.    (1999),   201:   1).<br>
The   present   invention   now   has   as   its   object   to   provide   a<br>
vaccine   based   on    a   NCAM-180   as    tumor-associated   antigen<br>
(TAA),    its   epitope,    mimotope,    specific   or   anti-idiotypic<br>
antibody    is    used    for    preparing    a    medicament    which    is<br>
employed    for    the    prophylactic    and/or    therapeutic   active<br>
immunization  against  cancer,   optionally  in  combination  with<br>
chemotherapy.<br>
The    TAA    preferably    is    selected    from    the    group    of    the<br>
peptides    or   proteins   as    described   herein,    in   particular<br>
NCAM-180   or   Exonl8_MUM   as   described   herein   before.    In   an<br>
even   further  embodiment  the  TAA  is   selected  from  the  group<br>
consisting  of:<br>
an   isolated  protein   consisting  essentially  of   SEQ   ID  NO:2,<br>
SEQID  NO   :   4,   SEQ   ID  NO:   6;   or<br>
to  a  fragment  said  isolated  proteins,   wherein  said  fragment<br>
is    capable    of    inducing    a    humoral    or    a    cellular    immune<br>
response   in   a   mammal      and   comprises   an   epitope   selected<br>
f rom;<br>
PAASNLSSSVLAN    (AA101-113   of   SEQ   ID   NO:2),    VLSPSAPAGVG    (AA<br>
117-127  of  SEQ  ID  NO: 2),   LAAAAAPATEAPQ   (AA  153-165  ot  SEQ  ID<br>
N0:2),      KGPDPEPTQPGA      (AA     174-195     of     SEQ     ID     NO:2)     and<br>
DFKMDEGNFK   (AA  216-225  of  SEQ   ID  NO:2).<br>
The   TAAs   used   in   the   vaccine   according   to   the   invention<br>
preferably induce a functional immune response directed against tumor cells. In doing so, not only tumor cells during their cell division, but also in the dormant state (e.g. tumor-stem cells as was recently shown), are to be attacked for an effective treatment of the "minimal residual disease", or the reduction of the metastasizing potential. According to the invention, preferably epithelial cancers, such as breast cancer, cancer of the stomach and intestines, of the prostate, pancreas, ovaries and the lung, e.g. SCLC ("small cell lung cancer") and NSCLC ("non small cell lung cancer")   will  be  or  can  be  treated.<br>
In a particular embodiment, according to the invention at least two egual or different epitopes of the NCAM-180 TAA, are provided, or imitated, respectively, in the vaccine. Thus, by the active immunization, a plurality of antibodies with specificity for the same molecule, yet for different NCAM-180  binding  sites,   can  be  generated.<br>
The vaccine can also comprise a glycosilated antibody, particularly if the glycosilation itself can also imitate an epitope of a carbohydrate epitope of the TAA. This antibody may particularly well imitate cellular tumor antigens, and accordingly, it causes the desired immune response for the inhibition  of  epithelial  tumor  cells.<br>
According to the invention, the vaccine may be used for active immunization, and therefore it is administered in small amounts only. Thus, no particular side effects are expected, particularly no fever and no increase in the glucose level, even if the immunogenic active substance used according to the invention is derived from a non-human species, such as a murine antibody. However- it is assumed that a recombinant, chimeric as well as a humanized or human active  substance   combined  with  murine  and  human  components<br>
will be particularly suitable for an administration to humans. On the other hand, a murine portion in the active substance by being foreign may additionally provoke the immune   response   in  humans.<br>
Although, naturally, the vaccine used according to the invention may contain an active substance derived from a native antibody, which possibly has been isolated from an organism or patient, often an antibody-derivative is used which preferably is selected from the group of antibody fragments, conjugates or homologues, but also complexes and adsorbates. In any case, it is preferred for the antibody derivative to contain at least parts of the Fab fragment, preferably together with at least parts of the F(ab')2-fragment, and/or parts of the hinge-region and/or of the Fc-part of a lambda or kappa antibody. Furthermore, also a single-chain antibody derivative, such as a so-called single chain antibody may be used in a vaccine as defined by the invention. Preferably, an antibody of the type of an immunoglobulin, e.g. an IgG, IgM or IgA, is used. Particularly preferably an IgG2a-antibody is used, since IgG2a antibodies exhibit a particularly good complement activation, resulting in an increased immunogenicity of the vaccine. This, moreover, has the advantage that the content of  antibody  in  the  vaccine  can  be   further  reduced.<br>
According to the invention, preferably also a vaccine is used which comprises an antibody or an antibody derivative directed against a tumor-associated antigen, i.e. an abl. The specificity of the antibody preferably is chosen from among the above-mentioned groups of the TAAs, in particular selected from the group of NCAM-180 or Exonl8_MUM. A  particularly  preferably  used  vaccine  contains  an  antibody<br>
which specifically binds an antibody. The tumor vaccine thus contains in particular anti-idiotypic antibodies, i.e. ab2, for an active immunization. Antiidotypic antibodies used according to the invention preferably again recognize the idiotype of an antibody which is directed against the TAA. In this manner, already an epitope of a TAA on the paratope of the anti-idiotypic antibody is formed as a mimic for the TAA. Here, too, the preferred selection is made from the above-indicated  groups  of  the  TAAs.<br>
The vaccine used according to the invention advantageously is provided in a suitable formulation. Preferred are such formulations with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. This comprises, e.g., auxiliary substances, buffers, salts, preservatives. The vaccine may, e.g., be used for the prophylaxis and therapy of cancer-associated conditions, such as metastasis formation and minimal residual disease of cancer patients. In this instance, antigen-presenting cells are specifically modulated in vivo or also ex vivo so as to specifically generate the immune response against the TAA and  the  tumor  cells.<br>
Accordingly, in case of an active immunization, it is also an object of the present invention to provide a vaccine formulation that contains the immunogenic active substance in most cases only at low concentrations, such as in an immunogenic amount ranging from 0.01 [mu]g to 10 mg. Depending on the nature of the TAA, its epitope, mimotope, specific cr anti-idiotypic antibody, depending on the use of species-foreign sequences or derivatization, but also depending on the auxiliary agents or adjuvants, respectively, used, the suitable immunogenic dose will be chosen,   e.g.   in  the   range  of  from  0.01   [mu]g  to   750   [mu]g,<br>
preferably 100 [mu]g to 500 [mu]g. A depot vaccine which is to be delivered to the organism over an extended period of time may, however, also contain much higher antibody amounts, such as from at least 1 mg to up to more than 10 mg. The concentration will depend on the administered amount of the liquid or suspended vaccine. A vaccine usually is provided in ready-to-use syringes having a volume of from 0.01 to 1 ml, preferably 0.1 to 0.75 ml, of the concentrated solution,   or  suspension,   respectively.<br>
For the passive immunization as described hereinbefore, the present invention further provides a vaccine formulation comprising the TAA specific antibodies in range of from 1 mg to  10  gr,   preferably  from  10  mg  to  1   gr.<br>
The vaccine used according to the invention preferably presents the immunogen or antibody in a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier which is suitable for a subcutaneous, intramuscular or also intradermal or transdermal administration. A further type of administering is via the mucosal pathway, such as a vaccination by nasal or peroral administration. If solids are employed as auxiliary agents for the vaccine formulation, e.g. an adsorbate or a suspended mixture of the antibody with the auxiliary agent is administered. In special embodiments, the vaccine is administered as a solution, or liquid vaccine, respectively, in  an  aqueous   solvent.<br>
Preferably, one or more vaccine units of the tumor vaccine are already provided in suitable ready-to-use syringes. As an antibody is relatively stable as compared to the TAA, vaccines based on antibodies or their derivatives have the essential  advantage  that  they  can  be  put  on  the  market  as  a<br>
storage-stable solution or suspension in a ready-to-use form. However, a content of preserving agents, such as thimerosal or other preserving agents with an improved tolerance is not necessary, may, however, be provided in the formulation for a longer durability at storage temperatures of from refrigerator temperatures up to room temperature. The vaccine used according to the invention may, however, also be provided in frozen or lyophilized form which may be thawed,   or  reconstituted,   respectively,   when  needed.<br>
In any case, it has proven suitable to increase the immunogenicity of the active substance used according to the invention by using adjuvants in the vaccine formulation. Vaccine adjuvants suitable therefor preferably are aluminum hydroxide (Alu gel) or -phosphate, also growth factors, lymphokines, cytokines, such as IL-2, IL-12, GM-CSF, gamma interferon or complement factors, such as C3d, furthermore liposome preparations, and also formulations with additional antigens, against which the immune system has already produced a strong immune response, such as tetanus toxoid, bacterial toxins, such as Pseudomonas exotoxins and derivatives  of  Lipid  A.<br>
An adjuvant which allows for the medicament to be administered without any side effects is preferred. The term side effects encompasses, e.g., an increased glucose level or fever; local reddenings at the site of administration or slight swellings are not considered to be special side effects but indicate that an immune reaction is going on. To formulate the vaccine, also further known methods for conjugating or denaturing vaccine components may be used so as to further increase the immunogenicity of the active substance.        Particular    embodiments    of    the    vaccine    used<br>
according to the invention comprise further vaccination<br>
antigens,	in        particular        additional        anti-idiotypic<br>
antibodies, also mixtures of immunogenic antibodies with various  antibodies  which  are  simultaneously  administered.<br>
When combined with chemotherapy, the use according to the<br>
invention of the vaccine is preferably at the beginning of<br>
the    chemotherapy.	Preferably,     chemotherapy    is    started<br>
within 1 to 2 weeks. A vaccination simultaneously with and/or during the chemotherapy is also preferred for practical reasons. The patient is already under clinical treatment, the additional therapeutic measures are easy to carry out. If the immunotherapy is already effected on the first day of the chemotherapy or within the first 2 to 3 days, the immune system can be activated already at an early point of time, even before the organism has been adversely affected by the chemotherapy. Chemotherapy does, in fact, have side effects, such as that of a weakened immune system, which makes the patient increasingly infection-prone. Precisely for this reason it has been surprising that the immunotherapy can successfully be used immediately before and during the chemotherapy. Thus, it could be observed that the immune response after the inoculation with a tumor vaccine could be induced on the first day, several hours prior to the beginning of the chemotherapy, to the same extent as without a chemotherapeutical treatment. In any event, the serum content of immunoglobulins and vaccination antigen-specific antibodies was persistently increased, irrespective of a chemotherapy. There were even signs that the specific immune response was even increased by the chemotherapy. The     vaccine     administration     regimen     according     to     the<br>
invention contains preferably not only the initial<br>
vaccination within the scope of the chemotherapy, but also<br>
several booster vaccinations at certain time intervals which<br>
for practical reasons possibly can be equal to the intervals<br>
of the chemotherapy. Also following the chemotherapy, the<br>
long-term immunotherapy over months and years very much is a<br>
suitable regimen. Both, the initial vaccination and also<br>
later booster vaccinations preferably are effected with the<br>
same    vaccine.	The    combination    with    the    adjuvant    or<br>
palliative chemotherapy is preferred. The combination with a monotherapy or polytherapy is possible. For reasons of the different mechanisms of action, the vaccine preferably is combined  with  the  polychemotherapy.<br>
Preferable agents used for the chemotherapy are alkylating pharmaceutical preparations. Thus, e.g., agents containing taxane, anthracyclins or platinum are preferred. All the conventional preparations which are used for various cancer treatments can be combined according to the invention. The chemotherapeutic agents commonly are administered intravenously or perorally. Peroral forms of administration of the chemotherapeutic agents may possibly also be administered with the peroral form of the vaccine according to  the   invention  as  a  combination  preparation.<br>
A vaccination as defined by the present invention may basically be carried out both for a therapeutic and also for a prophylactic treatment. Such a prophylactic vaccination particularly-though not exclusively-aims at persons that have been diagnosed with cancer and which may have small (single dormant cells, small metastasis) metastasis, but is currently free of any signs of the disease. In such a case the   vaccine    would   be   a    prophylactic   vaccine    in    that    it<br>
induces an immune response which might be helpful against a future  outbreak  of  cancer.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the vaccine used according to the<br>
invention comprises an NCAM-180 gene product or an antibody<br>
against this gene product, or a corresponding anti-idiotypic<br>
antibody,     respectively.	The    methods    of    formulating    a<br>
vaccine   suitable   for  the  inventive  method  are   known:<br>
The NCAM-180 TAA, its derivatives, epitopes and mimics can be obtained from natural or synthetic sources. Also the antibody components can be chemically synthesized and subsequently connected with epitope structures, or synthesized in common. In a chemical synthesis of antibody carrier molecules it is possible to introduce reactive groups at special sites so as to be able both to control the extent of coupling with an epitope as well as the type and location of the binding. Immunogenic NCAM-180 TAA, its epitopes, mimics or antibodies, may also be prepared as recombinant molecules by genetic engineering methods. By changing the genetically engineered nucleic acids which encode native molecules, e.g. suitable derivatives can be produced. A glycosylation of a recombinant gene product with corresponding tumor-associated glycan structures can also be effected by a production in cells which have been genetically modified such that they will glycosylate proteins accordingly. Such cells may be natural isolates (cell clones), they can be found by an appropriate screening for the desired glycosylation. Yet, also cells   may   be   modified   such   that   they   will   express<br>
 <br>
the corresponding enzymes required for the desired glycosylation such that particularly the desired glycosylation will be found on the recombinant polypeptide or protein (Glycoconj. J. (1999), 16: 81). However, it is also possible to enzymatically produce, or change, respectively, the glycosylation pattern of proteins (Clin. Chem. Lab. Med. (1998), 36:   373).<br>
According  to  a  particular  embodiment  of  the  present<br>
invention,      the     vaccine     used     according     to     the<br>
invention   comprises   a   nucleic   acid   molecule   as   a<br>
precursor  for  the  NCAM-180  TAA,   wherein  the  nucleic<br>
acid    molecule    encodes    NCAM-180    gene    products    as<br>
defined  by   the   present   invention.    The   DNA   vaccine<br>
obtained  is  administered  just  like  tumor  vaccines  on<br>
protein  base.<br>
The    present    invention    also    relates    to    a    kit    which    is<br>
suitable   for   the  prophylactic  and/or  therapeutic   treatment<br>
of      cancer-associated      conditions.      This      kit      comprises<br>
a)	a vaccine based on the NCAM-180 tumor-associated antigen, its epitope, mimotope, specific or anti-idiotypic antibody, and  optionally<br>
b)	an  agent   for  chemotherapy.<br>
The selection of the components of the kit according to the invention as well as their combination is carried out as described before. Preferably, the kit further comprises suitable application devices, such as, e.g., syringes, infusion devices, etc. If the vaccine is provided in lyophilized form, the kit will further contain a suitable reconstituting solution which optionally comprises special stabilizers cr reconstitution accelerators. The further preferred   kit   comprises   several   units   of   the  vaccine   used<br>
according to the invention, which will be employed for the initial vaccination as well as for one or more, preferably up  to  three,   booster  vaccinations.<br>
The number of booster vaccinations may, however, also be higher, and for this, kits containing several vaccination units alone, without a combination with a chemotherapeutic agent, are offered. The frequency optionally will range from 1 to 12 per year, particularly preferred it will range from 4 to 8 per year. The dosage may remain equal or may decrease. Booster vaccinations can be carried out at regular intervals, in principle life-long. Suitable intervals range from about 6 to 24 months and can be determined by checking the titer of the induced CTL response (a booster should be made as soon as the titers of the induced CTL response has markedly  dropped).<br>
This invention will be better understood by reference<br>
to the Experimental Details that follow, but those skilled<br>

Cloning and purification  of NCAM Exonl8_MUM<br>
A.   NCAM  Exonl8_MUM  cloning<br>
PCR primers were designed. The nucleotide sequence of the complete Exonl8_MUM (816 nt) (SEQ ID No.l) and the nucleotide sequence of a truncated form of the Exonl8_MUM (369 nt) (SEQ ID No. 5) were picked up from cDNA of H69 cells. These cells were shown to overexpress the Exonl8_MUM. Both the forward and the reverse primer contained restriction sites for sub-cloning into the pRSET (protein production)   and  the  pCI   (DNA  immunization)   vector.<br>

B.	NCAM  Exonl8_MUM  protein  production  and  purification<br>
Bacteria  were  transformed with  expression  constructs   (pRSET,<br>
Invitrogen)   encoding  the  Exonl8_MUM protein.  We  used  a  pRSET<br>
construct   encoding    the   truncated   NCAM   Exonl8_MUM   protein<br>
(marked   in   italic   in   the   NCAM   Exonl8_MUM   protein   sequence<br>
above) and a pRSET construct encoding the full length NCAM Exonl8_MUM protein sequence. Transformation was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Both forms of the protein were expressed as His-tagged proteins and purification was performed on Ni-chelate columns according to standard procedures. His-tagged proteins were eluted from the columns using 300 mM imidazole, and eluted protein solutions were subsequently re-naturated using a standard dialysis against PBS. Purity of the NCAM Exonl8_MUM protein products  is  shown   in  figure  3  A  and  B.<br>

C.	Immunizations  and immune  response measurements<br>
CI. NCAM Exonl8_MUM immunization induces cellular immune responses<br>
Based on differential expression PCR, the NCAM Exonl8_MUM splice variant was identified as a potential target for lung cancer immunotherapy. As described above, for this novel antigen both DNA and recombinant protein was prepared. Using the above procedure, truncated MUM protein was produced in E. coli, purified and subsequently used for immunization of Balb/c  mice.<br>
Cl.1 Immunization with Exonl8_MUM protein and/or Exonl8_MUM DNA and in vitro re-stimulation with an overlapping 9-mer peptide  pool.<br>
In a first type of experiment, some mice were primed, hereinafter also referred to as immunized, with truncated Exonl8_MUM protein in PBS, either with or without an adjuvant such as Abisco-100, and some were immunized with Exonl8_MUM encoding DNA. In addition immunization with Exonl8_MUM protein was combined with Exonl8_MUM DNA immunization. At day 21, these different groups were boosted as  shown  below:<br>
Remark:<br>
-	Exonl8_MUM  protein   is   represented  in  the   table  as  MUM  protein.<br>
-	Exonl8_MUM  DNA  is   represented  in   the  table  as  MUM  DNA<br>

For  protein  immunization  we  used:<br>
o    10  ng  recombinant  Exonl8_MUM  protein   in   PBS, optionally  formulated  with   12   \iq  Absico-100. For  DNA  immunization  we  used:<br>
o    2  x  50  ng  Exonl8_MUM  DNA   (in  pCI-vector)    (50  ug  into the  M.   tibialis  anterior  of  each  of  the  two  hind legs)<br>
Balb/c  mice   (n=4   in  each  group)   were   immunized  on  day  0  and boosted  on  day  21.  Thirty  days  after  the  first  immunization, mouse     spleens     were     isolated,     spleen     cell     suspensions prepared  and  seeded  at  a  density  of   1.5   106   cells/well.   In<br>
vitro re-stimulation was performed for 4h at 37°C (5% CO2) .<br>
Re-stimulation was performed with a pool of overlapping 9-<br>
mer peptides covering the full-length amino acid sequence of<br>
the truncated MUM protein. A total of 45 overlapping<br>
5     peptides     were     used.	We     calculated     the     number     of<br>
intracellular IFN-y containing cells in 105 CD8 positive cells for all mice immunized, as determined by flowcytometry (figure 4 group A-G) . Our data show a low number of intracellular IFN-y containing CD8 positive T-cells representing a limited CTL response in the Exonl8_MUM protein immunized and boosted animals (figure 4 group D). Mice immunized with Exonl8_MUM protein in Abisco-100 adjuvant apparently did not induce a CTL response at all (figure 4 group C) . For the Exonl8_MUM DNA immunized mice we found that intramuscular injection of the truncated Exonl8_MUM encoding DNA clearly induced a MUM specific cytotoxic T-cell response (figure 4 group F and G) , when compared to the pCI vector alone immunized mice, performed as as control immunization. We found 727 intracellular IFN-y containing cells on a total of 105 CD8 positive T-cells (0.7%). Our data even suggest a slight increase in the number of intracellular IFN-y containing CD8 positive T-cells for mice immunized with Exonl8_MUM DNA and boosted with Exonl8_MUM protein with Abisco-100 (887 intracellular IFN-y containing cells on 105 CD8 positive T-cells, 0.9%). For all spleens as a negative control, an in vitro re-stimulation with an irrelevant peptide pool (IPP) was performed. Here, as a control a peptide pool covering an NCAM region that differs from the Exonl8_MUM sequence, such as for example the NCAM exon 7pi8 region of the NCAM protein. In the present example the IPP consisted of 17 overlapping    peptides      (9-mers,      5     amino     acids     overlap)<br>
 <br>
covering a 76 amino acid sequence the NCAM exon 7pi8 region of  the  NCAM  protein.<br>
For neither the recombinant Exonl8_MUM protein immunized animals, nor the Exonl8_MUM DNA immunized animals, intracellular IFN- containing CD8 positive T-cells were found upon re-stimulation with this IPP. Since T-cells from immunized animals cannot be re-stimulated with an IPP, we conclude that the MUM immunization induces MUM specific T-cells.<br>
Based on this experiment we conclude that immunization with recombinant Exonl8_MUM protein and Exonl8_MUM encoding DNA induces a MUM-specific T-cell response. Exnl8_MUM protein immunization only resulted in a limited number of intracellular IFN- containing CD8 positive T-cells, whereas immunization with Exonl8_MUM encoding DNA induced a significant  cellular  MUM  specific  immune   response.<br>
Based on the results of these experiments we conclude that: o    immunization      with      Exonl8_MUM       DNA      induces       a<br>
significant MUM specific cytotoxic T-cell response, o   the       truncated       Exonl8_MUM       protein       alone       is<br>
immunogenic  and  induces  a  MUM  specific  CTL  response,<br>
as  identified  upon  re-stimulation  with  a  MUM-related<br>
overlapping   9-mer  peptide  pool   .<br>
C 1.2 Immunization with Exonl8_MUM protein and/or Exonl8_MUM DNA, in vitro re-stimulation with an overlapping 9-mer peptide  pool<br>
In the next type of experiment we used for the in vitro re-stimulation  individual  9-mer  peptides  covering  the  truncated<br>
Exonl8_MUM protein sequence (9-mer peptides, 5-mer overlap), and not a total 9-mer peptide pool described hereinbefore. In vitro re-stimulation with individual 9-mer peptides was done in order to perform a detailed mapping of CTL epitopes on the Exonl8_MUM protein sequence. In each experiment 11 animals were used, 1 negative control mouse, and two groups each of 5 animals that were immunized per group as shown below  at  day  0  and boosted  as   shown  below at  day  21:<br>
Group  1:   1 mice  immunized and boosted with  100  µg pCI  empty vector<br>
Group  2:   5 mice   immunized and boosted with   100  µg MUM DNA<br>
Group  3:   5 mice  immunized and boosted with  210  pg NCAM  18MUM protein.<br>
We did  9  experiments,   each  with  11  animals.<br>
Forty-five animals were immunized with the truncated Exonl8_MUM protein, 45 animals with truncated Exonl8_MUM DNA and  9  animals  with  the  pCI   empty vector.<br>
In each experiment the mice were sacrificed 12 - 14 days after the boost. Spleens were excised, spleen cell suspensions prepared, seeded in multiwell 96 plates and in vitro re-stimulated with individual NCAM Exonl8_MUM 9-mer peptides. In each experiment 5 peptides were tested for in vitro re-stimulation, the experiment was repeated 9 times, 45 peptides were tested in total. This epitope mapping allowed us to localize the best CTL epitopes in the truncated Exonl8_MUM protein.<br>
In vitro re-stimulation was performed with a total of 4 5 overlapping 9-mer MUM peptides covering the AA sequence of the  truncated Exonl8_MUM protein   (table  2).<br>

For each peptide the re-stimulation was performed in 5-fold. Cells were permeabilised, fixed and stained for intracellular IFN-7 and surface expressed CD8 using fluorescent labeled antibodies. The number of intracellular IFN- containing cells per 105 CD8 positive cells was measured  by  FACS  analysis.<br>
Results  are  show   in  figure  5.<br>
We found that immunization with the truncated Exonl8_MUM protein induced MUM specific cytotoxic T-cells as shown by in vitro re-stimulation with peptide 26-27, peptide 30-32, peptide 40-42, peptide 45-47 and peptide 55-58 (Figure 5). Interestingly, these data show that some specific regions of the truncated MUM recombinant protein are potential CTL epitopes. Moreover these data confirm that the truncated MUM protein  is  highly  immunogenic  even  without  Abisco-100  as  was<br>
found in the first immunization experiment. In addition, mice were also immunized with NCAM Exonl8_MUM plasmid DNA. As shown in figure 6A DNA immunization induced a high MUM specific CTL response. In vitro re-stimulation with peptide 25-28, peptide 30-32, peptide 40-44, peptide 45-47, peptide 52-54, peptide 62 and peptide 65 clearly showed that MUM specific cytotoxic T-cells were induced upon immunization of the animals with the Exonl8_MUM DNA. When compared with the CTL epitopes from the protein-immunized mice, the peptides 26-27, 30-32, 40-42, 45-47 and peptide 65 were also found in the DNA immunized animals. These data show that against some of"the epitopes cytotoxic T-cells are induced in amimals both  upon  DNA  and  protein  immunization<br>
Next, the CTL epitopes as found in Exonl8_MUM DNA and Exonl8_MUM protein immunization, were compared with the CTL epitopes as predicted by SYPHEITI software. This software was used to predict scores for all the 9-mer peptides for the H2-Dd/d haplotype, the MHC haplotype of the Balb/c mice. For all the 9-mer peptides used in the in vitro re-stimulation a score was predicted, these scores are represented in figure 6B. Some of the peptides predicted as potential CTL epitopes, which means that these peptides have the potential to re-stimulate in vitro the corresponding in vivo induced cytotoxic T-cell, were indeed confirmed in our experiments in mice. Our data show that in vitro re-stimulation of lymphocytes isolated from Exonl8_MUM immunized mice, with any one of peptides 31, 53 and 56, effectively results in re-stimulation of these in vivo primed  CD8  positive  T-cells   in  mice.<br>
D.   A  NCAM  Exonl8_MUM  ELISA<br>
A   NCAM   Exonl8_MUM   ELISA   was   performed   as    follows.    ELISA<br>
plates were coated with His-tagged NCAM Exonl8_MUM proteins (full length or truncated) and blocked with non-fat dry milk (2%). The serially diluted sera of NCAM Exonl8_MUM protein immunized mice are added. MUM specific antibodies induced upon immunization specifically bind to the Exonl8_MUM protein on the coated plates. The specificity of the antibodies was confirmed by detecting the binding of the antibodies to a plate coated with His-tagged negative control protein that was also produced in E. coli. Bound antibodies are detected with a horseradish peroxidase conjugated anti-mouse Ig antibody. The conjugated enzyme oxidizes the 3, 3', 5, 5'-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) substrate. The reaction is stopped with H2SO4 and the OD of the oxidized product  measured  at  450  nm according  to  standard procedures.<br>
Dl. NCAM Exonl8_MUM immunization induces humoral immune responses<br>
We measured antibody titers in the sera of Balb/c mice immunized with NCAM Exonl8_MUM protein and/or Exonl8_MUM plasmid DNA. Animals immunized with truncated Exonl8_MUM protein both in PBS or in Abisco-100 adjuvant, developed anti-MUM specific serum antibody titers as shown in figure 7 group C and D (dark bars). No binding of serum antibodies was shown when ELISA was performed with plates coated with His-tagged negative control protein that was also produced in E. coli (figure 7 group C and D (grey bars). These data show that no anti-histidine antibodies or no antibodies against E. coli linked proteins were produced in the serum of the immunized animals. Immunization with plasmid encoding the NCAM Exonl8_MUM DNA did not induce serum antibody titers. Only when DNA immunized mice were boosted with formulated   NCAM   Exonl8_MUM   protein   a   clear    induction   of<br>
anti-MUM antibody titers was found (figure 7 group F and G) . Our data clearly show that immunization of mice with truncated NCAM Exonl8_MUM protein induces a significant MUM-specific  humoral   immune  response.<br>
D2.   Full-length  Exonl8_MUM  protein  versus   truncated Exonl8_MUM  protein  based  ELISA.<br>
Serum antibody titers of mice immunized with truncated Exonl8_MUM protein were measured. The serum was obtained from in total 45 animals immunized with truncated Exonl8_MUM protein and 5 mice immunized with empty pCI-vector. The humoral immune responses as detected on ELISA plates coated with full-length Exonl8_MUM and truncated Exonl8_MUM recombinant  protein  were  compared   (Figure  8).<br>
As shown in figure 8, no significant difference was found in the detection of MUM specific antibodies in the sera of immunized animals if coating was done with full-length or truncated Exonl8_MUM protein. These data show that when coated with complete Exonl8_MUM protein all epitopes as exposed  in  the  truncated  Exonl8_MUM  are   still  available.<br>
E.   Production  of  anti-MUM  monoclonal  antibodies<br>
Mice were immunized/boosted with truncated NCAM Exonl8_MUM protein according to standard procedures. Spleen cells were fused with NSO myeloma cells. Fused cells were seeded in HAT selection medium according to standard procedures. Viable clones were selected and the secreted antibody subsequently screened on NCAM Exonl8_MUM expressing cells following standard immunocytochemical procedures. Monoclonal    antibodies    obtained    were    screened    on    NCAM<br>
Exonl8_MUM positive H69 and H82 cells. Finally, one clone was selected, this hybridoma clone produces a monoclonal antibody that shows the specific NCAM-like staining on the NCAM Exonl8_MUM expressing cell lines H69 and H82 in immunocytochemical staining. We used the Alexa fluor labeled goat antibodies to mouse IgG as a secondary anti¬body and performed the visualization by fluorescent microscopy (figure 9) . Further selection of clone (MUMI 21 B2) was based on the absence of staining on the NCAM Exonl8_MUM negative HCT-116 cells. Moreover, MUMI 21 B2 staining showed a proper localization, at the cell-cell contact regions as shown by confocal imaging (figure 10). For these experiments we used antibodies that were enriched  using  the  production  in  a  MiniPerm  bioreactor.<br>
In  summary,   the  anti-MUM  monoclonal  antibody   (MUMI  21  B2) that     shows    an    NCAM-like     staining    on    NCAM    Exonl8_MUM expressing  cells,   and  not  on  the  NCAM  Exonl8_MUM  negative HCT-116  cells.<br>
