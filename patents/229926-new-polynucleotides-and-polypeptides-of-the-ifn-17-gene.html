NEW POLYNUCLEOTIDES AND POLYPEPTIDES OF THE IFNα-17 GENE<br>
RELATED APPLICATIONS:<br>
The present invention claims priority to French Patent Application 0105516 filed on April 24, 2001 titled « Nouveaux polynucleotides et polypeptides du gene IFNα-17».<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Field of the Invention.<br>
The present invention relates to new polynucleotides derived from the nucleotide sequence of the IFNα-17 gene comprising new SNPs, and new polypeptides derived from the natural wild-type IFNα-17 protein comprising mutations caused by these SNPs, as well as their therapeutic uses.<br>
Related Art.<br>
The interferon alpha 17 gene, hereinafter referred to as IFNα-17, is described in the publications:<br>
Olopade et al: "Mapping of the shortest region of overlap of deletions of the short arm of chromosome 9 associated with human neoplasia"; Genomics; 14: 437-443; 1992. Lawn R. M. et al.; "DNA sequence of two closely linked human leukocyte interferon genes"; Science 212 (4499), 1159^1162(1981).<br>
The nucleotide sequence of this gene is accessible under accession number V00532 in the GenBank database.<br>
The IFNα are known for their cellular antiproliferative effects and their involvements in antiviral and antiparasitic responses.<br>
The IFNα are also known to inhibit the expression of several other cytokines at the level of the hematopoietic stem cells, as well as to inhibit the cellular proliferation of certain tumors.<br>
The IFNα are also known to reduce the expression of the receptors to the EGF in renal carcinomas, to inhibit the expression of certain mitochondrial genes, to inhibit the proliferation of fibroblasts, monocytes and B lymphocytes, especially in vitro, and to<br><br>
block the synthesis of antibodies by B lymphocytes.<br>
The IFNα are also known to induce the expression of tumor specific antigens on the surface of tumor cells and also to induce the genes placed under the control of promoter regions of the ISRE type (Interferon-Stimulated Response Element) by acting on the specific transcription factors of these ISRE.<br>
It is known that the IFNα are involved in different disorders and/or human diseases, such as the different cancers like for example, carcinomas, melanomas, lymphomas, leukemias and cancers of the liver, neck, head and kidneys, cardiovascular diseases, metabolic diseases such as those that are not connected with the immime system like, for example, obesity, infectious diseases such as hepatitis B and C and AIDS, pneumonias, ulcerative colitis, diseases of the central nervous system like, for example, Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia and depression, the rejection of tissue or organ grafts, healing of wounds, anemia in dialyzed patients, allergies, asthma, multiple sclerosis, osteoporosis, psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease, autoimmune diseases and disorders, gastrointestinal disorders or even disorders connected with chemotherapy treatments.<br>
The IFNα are particularly used for the treatment of certain leukemias, metastasizing renal carcinomas as well as tumors that appear following an immimodeficiency, such as Kaposi's sarcoma in the case of AIDS. The IFNα are also effective against other types of tumors and against certain viral infections. The IFNα are ^ also recognized by the FDA (Food and Drug Administration) for the treatment of genital warts or venereal diseases.<br>
However, the IFNα, and in particular IFNα-17, have numerous side effects when they are used in pharmaceutical compositions, such as reactions of acute hypersensitivity (urticaria, bronchoconstriction, anaphylactic shock etc.), cardiac airythmias, low blood pressure, epileptic seizures, problems with thyroid functions, flulike syndromes (fevers, sweats, myalgias) etc.<br>
Furthermore, the patients treated with IFNα can develop antibodies neutralizing these molecules, thus decreasing their effectiveness.<br><br>
The inventor has found new polypeptide and new polynucleotide analogs to the IFNα-17 gene capable of having a different functionality from the natural wild-type IFNα-17 protein.<br>
These new polypeptides and polynucleotides can notably be used to treat or prevent the disorders or diseases previously mentioned and avoid all or part of the disadvantages, which are tied to them.<br>
BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention has as its first object new polynucleotides that differ from, the nucleotide sequence of the reference wild-type IFNα-17 gene, in that it comprises one or several SNPs (Single Nucleotide Polymorphism).<br>
The nucleotide sequence SEQ ID NO. 1 of the human reference wild-type IFNα-17 gene is composed of 1873 nucleotides and comprises a coding sequence of 570 nucleotides, from nucleotide 639 (start codon) to the nucleotide 1208 (stop codon).<br>
The applicant has identified 2 SNPs in the nucleotide sequence of the reference wild-type IFNα-17 gene.<br>
These SNPs are the following: g771c, 808Ins(a).<br>
It is understood, in the sense of the present invention, that the numbering corresponding to the positioning of the SNP previously defined is relative to the numbering of the nucleotide sequence SEQ ID NO. 1.<br>
The letters a, t, c and g correspond respectively to the nitrogenous bases adenine, thymine, cytosine and guanine.<br>
The first letter corresponds to the wild-t3q)e nucleotide, whereas the last letter corresponds to the mutated nucleotide.<br>
Thus, the SNP g771c corresponds to a mutation of the nucleotide guanine (g) at position 771 of the nucleotide sequence SEQ ID NO. I of the reference wild-type IFNα-17 gene into a cytosine (c).<br>
The SNP 808Ins(a) corresponds to the insertion of the nucleotide adenine (a) at position 808 of the nucleotide sequence SEQ ID NO. 1 of the reference wild-type IFNα-17 gene.<br>
These SNPs were identified by the applicant using the determination process<br><br>
described in applicant's patent application PR 00 22894 , entitles process for me determination of one or several functional polymorphism(s) in the nucleotide sequence of a preselected functional candidate gene and its applications" and filed December 6, 2000, cited here by way of reference.<br>
The process described in this patent application permits the identification of one (or several) preexisting SNP(s) in at least one individual from a random population of individuals.<br>
In the scope of the present invention, a fragment of the nucleotide sequence of the IFNα-17 gene, comprising, for example, the coding sequence, was isolated from different individuals in a population of individuals chosen in a random manner.<br>
Sequencing of these fragments was then carried out on certain of these samples having a heteroduplex profile (that is a profile different from that of the reference wild-type   IFNα-17   gene   sequence)   after   analysis   by   DHPLC   ("Denaturing-High<br>
Performance Liquid Chromatography").<br>
The fragment sequenced in this way was then compared to the nucleotide sequence of the fragment of the reference wild-type IFNα-17 gene and the SNPs in conformity with the invention identified.<br>
Thus, the SNPs are natural and each of them is present in certain individuals of the world population.<br>
The reference wild-type IFNα-17 gene codes for an unmature protein of 189 amino acids, corresponding to the amino acid sequence SEQ ID NO. 2, that will be converted to a mature protein of 166 amino acids, by cleavage of the signal peptide that includes the 23 first amino acids.<br>
The coding SNPs of the invention, namely g771c and 808Ins(a), cause modifications, at the level of the amino acid sequence, of the protein encoded by the nucleotide sequence of the IFNα-17 gene. These modifications are the following:<br>
- The SNP g771c causes a mutation of the amino acid glycine (G) at position 45 in the immature protein of the IFNα-17 gene, corresponding to the amino acid sequence SEQ ID NO. 2, in arginine (R) and at position 22 of the mature protein. In the description of the present invention, one will indifferently call G22R and G45R the mutation encoded by this SNP according to whether one refers respectively to the<br><br>
mature protein or to the immature protein.<br>
- The SNP 808Ins(a) causes a mutation of the amino acid histidine (H) at position 57 in the immature protein of the IFNα-17 gene, corresponding to the amino acid sequence SEQ ID NO. 2, in glutamine (Q) and at position 34 of the mature protein. Moreover, the insertion of an adenine at position 808 on the nucleotide sequence causes a frameshift in the translation of the protein, which results in the appearance of a stop codon at position 58 of the amino acid sequence. Thus, the SNP 808Ins(a) causes a translation arrest just after the glutamine 57. As a consequence, the resulting immature protein is shortened and is only made of 57 amino acids. This polymorphism is also called H57Q frame 57. In the description of the present invention, one will indifferently call H34Q frame 34 and H57Q frame 57 the mutation encoded by this SNP according to whether one refers respectively to the mature protein or to the immature protein.<br>
The amino acid sequence SEQ ID NO. 3 corresponds to the mutated immature protein (H57Q frame 57) encoded by the nucleotide sequence ID SEQ NO. 1 comprising the SNP 808Ins(a).<br>
Each of the SNPs of the invention causes modifications of the spatial conformation of the polypeptides in confomiity with the invention compared to the polypeptide encoded by the nucleotide sequence of the wild-type reference IFNα-17 gene.<br>
These modifications can be observed by computational molecular modeling, according to methods that are well known to a person skilled in the art, making use of, for example, the modeling tools de novo (for example, SEQFOLD/MSI), homology (for example, MODELER/MSI), minimization of the force field (for example, DISCOVER, DELPHI/MSI) and/or molecular dynamics (for example, CFF/MSI).<br>
One example of such models is given hereinafter in the experimental section.<br>
Computational moleculai' modelmg shows that the mutation G22R on the mutated mature protein involves a modification and a displacement of the AB loop around position 22, which causes the disappearance of hydrogene bonds.<br>
Figures lA and IB show that the AB loop is unfolded and is protruding.<br>
On the natural wild-type IFNα-17, the G22 residue is very near the R144 residue. This R144 residue is known to be involved in the binding of interferon a-2<br><br>
(IFNα-2) to its receptor. The structure of IFNα-2 and of IFNα-17 being very similar, it is likely that the R144 residue in IFNα-17 is involved in the binding to its receptor.<br>
Thus, the G22R mutated protein possesses a three-dimensional conformation different from the natural wild-type IFNα-17 protein.<br>
Computational molecular modeling also permits the prediction that the presence of the amino acid arginine at position 22 involves a significant modification of the structure and of the function of the natural wild-type protein IFNα-17, notably at the level of the binding of IFNα-17 to its receptor.<br>
Genotyping of the polynucleotides in conformity with the invention can be carried out in such a fashion as to determine the allelic frequency of these polynucleotides in a population.<br>
The determination of the functionality of the polypeptides of the invention can equally be carried out by a test of their biological activity.<br>
In this regard, it is possible to measure, for example, signal transduction, dendritic cell maturation, cytokine release by T-lymphocytes, cytokine release by monocytes, in vitro or in vivo antiviral activity, cellular antiproliferative activity on Daudi Burkitt's cell line, cellular antiproliferative activity on TF-1 cell line of polypeptides in conformity with the invention and compare with the wild-type IFNα-17, or the wild-type IFNα-2 chosen as representative of Intron A, a commercial product.<br>
The invention also has for an object the use of polynucleotides and of polypeptides in conformity with the invention as well as of tlierapeutic molecules obtained and/or identified starting from these polynucleotides and polypeptides, notably for the prevention and the treatment of certain human disorders and/or diseases.<br>

See COMPUTATIONAL MOLECULAR BIOLOGY, Lesk, A.M., Ed., Oxford University Press, New York, 1998; BIOCOMPUTING INFORMATICS AND GENOME PROJECT, Smith, D.W., Ed., Academic Press, New York, 1993; COMPUTER ANALYSIS OF SEQUENCE DATA, PART I, Griffin, A.M. and Griffm H.G., Ed, Humana Press, New Jersey, 1994; and SEQUENCE ANALYSIS IN MOLECULAR BIOLOGY, von Heinje, G., Academic Press, 1987.<br><br>
The methods commonly employed to determine the identity and the similarity between two sequences are equally well described in the literature. See GUIDE TO HUGE COMPUTER, Martin J. Bishop, Ed, Academic Press, San Diego, 1994, and Carillo H. and Lipton D., Siam J Applied Math (1988) 48: 1073.<br>
A polynucleotide having, for example, an identity of at least 95 % with the nucleotide sequence SEQ ID NO. 1 is a polynucleotide which contains at most 5 points of mutation over 100 nucleotides, compared to said sequence.<br>
These points of mutation can be one (or several) substitution(s), addition(s) and/or deIetion(s) of one (or several) nucieotide(s).<br>
In the same way, a polypeptide having, for example, an identity of at least 95 % with the amino acid sequence SEQ ID NO. 2 is a polypeptide that contains at most 5 points of mutation over 100 amino acids, compared to said sequence.<br>
These points of mutation can be one (or several) substitution(s), addition(s) and/or deletion(s) of one (or several) amino acid(s).<br>
The polynucleotides and the polypeptides according to the invention which are not totally identical with respectively:<br>
-	the nucleotide sequence SEQ ID NO. 1 comprising at least one of the following SNPs:g771c and 808Ins(a)<br>
-	the amino acid sequence SEQ ID NO. 2 comprising the SNP G45R<br>

-	the amino acid sequence SEQ ID NO. 3 possibly comprising the SNP G45R.<br>
A variant, according to the invention, can be obtained, for example, by site-directed mutagenesis or by direct synthesis.<br>
By "SNP" is understood any natural variation of a base in a nucleotide sequence.<br><br>
A SNP, on a nucleotide sequence, can be coding, silent or non-coding.<br>
A coding SNP is a polymorphism included in the coding sequence of a nucleotide sequence that involves a modification of an amino acid in the sequence of amino acids encoded by this nucleotide sequence. In this case, the term SNP applies equally, by extension, to a mutation in an amino acid sequence.<br>
A silent SNP is a polymorphism included in the coding sequence of a nucleotide sequence that does not involve a modification of an amino acid in the amino acid sequence encoded by this nucleotide sequence.<br>
A non-coding SNP is a polymorphism included in the non-coding sequence of a nucleotide sequence. This polymorphism can notably be found in an intron, a splicing zone, a transcription promoter or a site enhancer sequence.<br>
By "functional SNP" is understood a SNP, such as previously defined, which is included in a nucleotide sequence or an amino acid sequence, having a functionality.<br>
By "functionality" is understood the biological activity of a polypeptide or of a polynucleotide.<br>
The functionality of a polypeptide or of a polynucleotide according to the invention can consist in a conservation, an augmentation, a reduction or a suppression of the biological activity of the polypeptide encoded by the nucleotide sequence of the wild-type reference gene or of this latter nucleotide sequence.<br>
The functionality of a polypeptide or of a polynucleotide according to the invention can equally consist in a change in the nature of the biological activity of the polypeptide encoded by the nucleotide sequence of the reference wild-type gene or of this latter nucleotide sequence.<br>
The biological activity can, notably, be linked to the affinity or to the absence of affinity of a polypeptide according to the invention with a receptor.<br>

More preferably, an isolated polynucleotide according to the invention codes for a polypeptide comprising all or part of the amino acid sequence SEQ ID NO. 3, possibly also having the coding SNP G45R.<br>
Preferably a polynucleotide according to the invention is composed of a DNA or RNA molecule.<br>
A polynucleotide according to the invention can be obtained by standard DNA or RNA synthetic methods.<br>
A polynucleotide according to the invention comprising SNP g771c can equally be obtained by site-directed mutagenesis starting from the nucleotide sequence of the IFNα-i7 gene by modifying the wild-type nucleotide guanine (g) by the mutated nucleotide cylosine (c) at position 771 of the nucleotide sequence SEQ ID NO. 1.<br><br>
A polynucleotide according to the invention comprising SNP 808Ins(a) can equally be obtained by site-directed mutagenesis starting from the nucleotide sequence of the IFNα-17 gene by adding an adenine nucleotide (a) at position 808 of the nucleotide sequence SEQ ID NO. 1.<br>
The processes of site-directed mutagenesis that can be implemented in this way are well known to a person skilled in the art. The publication of TA Kunkel in 1985 in "Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA" 82:488 can notably be mentioned.<br>
An isolated polynucleotide can equally include, for example, nucleotide sequences coding for pre-, pro- or pre-pro-protein amino acid sequences or marker amino acid sequences, such as hexa-histidine peptide.<br>
A polynucleotide of the invention can equally be associated with nucleotide sequences coding for other proteins or protein fragments in order to obtain fusion proteins or other purification products.<br>

A nucleotide sequence complementary to the nucleotide or polynucleotide sequence is defined as one that can hybridize with this nucleotide sequence, under stringent conditions.<br>
"Stringent hybridization conditions" is generally but not necessarily understood as the chemical conditions that permit a hybridization when the nucleotide sequences have an identity of at least 80 %, preferably greater than or equal to 90 %, still more preferably greater than or equal to 95 % and most preferably greater than or equal to 97 %.<br>
The stringent conditions can be obtained according to methods well known to a person skilled in the art and, for example, by an incubation of the polynucleotides, at 42° C, in a solution comprising 50 % formamide, 5xSSC (150 mM of NaCl, 15 mM of trisodium citrate), 50 mM of sodium phosphate (pH = 7.6), 5x Denhardt Solution, 10 %<br><br>
dextran sulfate and 20 μg denatured salmon sperm DNA, followed by washing the filters at 0.1xSSC, at 65° C.<br>
Within the scope of the invention, when the stringent hybridization conditions permit hybridization of the nucleotide sequences having an identity equal to 100 %, the nucleotide sequence is considered to be strictly complementary to the nucleotide sequence such as described under a).<br>
It is understood within the meaning of the present invention that the nucleotide sequence complementary to a nucleotide sequence comprises at least one anti-sense SNP according to the invention.<br>
Thus, for example, if the nucleotide sequence comprises the SNP g771c, its complementary nucleotide sequence comprises the nucleotide g at the equivalent of position 771.<br>

b)	a polynucleotide according to the invention comprising at least one SNP<br>
in order to identify, hybridize and/or amplify all or part of a polynucleotide having 80 to 100 % identity (preferably at least 90 % identity, more preferably 95 % identity and particularly 100 % identity) with the nucleotide sequence SEQ ID NO. 1 or if necessary its coding sequence (from nucleotide 639 to nucleotide 1208), it being understood that each one of these sequences comprises at least one of the following SNPs:g771c,808Ins(a).<br>
Genotyping and determination of the frequency of a SNP<br>
The present invention equally has for its object the use of all or part of: a) a polynucleotide having 80 to 100 % identity (preferably at least 90 % identity, more preferably 95 % identity and particularly 100 % identity) with the nucleotide sequence SEQ ID NO. 1, and/or<br><br>
0) a polbnuclrotide accoramg to thinvention comprising at least one SNP<br>
for the genotyping of all or part of a polynucleotide having 80 to 100 % identity (preferably at least 90 % identity, more preferably 95 % identity and particularly 100 % identity) with the nucleotide sequence SEQ ID NO. 1 or if necessary its coding sequence (from nucleotide 639 to nucleotide 1208), it being understood that each one of these sequences comprises at least one of the following SNPs: g771c, 808Ins(a),<br>
According to the invention, the genotyping may be carried out on an individual or a population of individuals.<br>
Within the meaning of the invention, genotyping is defined as a process for the determination of the genotype of an individual or of a population of individuals. Genotype consists of the alleles present at one or more specific loci.<br>
"Population of individuals" is understood as a group of individuals selected in random or non-random fashion. These individuals can be humans, animals, microorganisms or plants.<br>
Usually, the group of individuals comprises at least 10 individuals, preferably from 100 to 300 individuals.<br>
The individuals can be selected according to their ethnicity or according to their phenotype, notably those who are affected by the following disorders and/or diseases: carcinomas, melanomas, lymphomas, leukemias and cancers of the liver, neck, head and kidneys, cardiovascular diseases, metabolic diseases such as those that are not connected with the immune system like, for example, obesity, infectious diseases in particular viral infections like hepatitis B and C and AIDS, pneumonias, ulcerative colitis, diseases of the central nervous system like, for example, Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia and depression, the rejection of tissue or organ grafts, healing of wounds, anemia in dialyzed patients, allergies, asthma, multiple sclerosis, osteoporosis, psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease, autoimmune diseases and disorders, gastrointestinal disorders or even disorders connected with chemotherapy treatments.<br>
A functional SNP according to the invention is preferably genotyped in a population of individuals.<br>
Multiple technologies exist which can be implemented in order to genotype SNPs  (see  notably  Kwok Pharmacogenomics,  2000,  vol   1,  pp  95-100.   "High-<br><br>
throughput genotyping assay approaches"). These technologies are based on one of the four following principles; allele specific oligonucleotide hybridization, oligonucleotide elongation by dideoxynucleotides optionally in the presence of deoxynucleotides, ligation of allele specific oligonucleotides or cleavage of allele specific oligonucleotides. Eack one of these technologies can be coupled to a detection system such as measurement of direct or polarized fluorescence, or mass spectrometry.<br>
Genotyping can notably be carried out by minisequencing with hot ddNTPs (2 different ddNTPs labeled by different fluorophores) and cold ddNTPs (2 different non labeled ddNTPs), in connection with a polarized fluorescence scanner, ^e minisequencing protocol with reading of polarized fluorescence (FP-TDI Technology or Fluorescence Polarization Template-direct Dye-Terminator Incorporation) is well known to a person skilled in the art.<br>
It can be carried out on a product obtained after amplification by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of the DNA of each individual. This PCR product is selected to cover the polynucleotide genie region containing the studied SNP. After the last step in the PCR thermocycler, the plate is placed on a polarized fluorescence scanner for a reading of the labeled bases by using fluorophore specific excitation and emission filters. The intensity values of the labeled bases are reported on a graph.<br>
For the PCR amplification, in the case of one SNP of the invention, the sense and antisense primers, respectively, can easily be selected by a person skilled in the art according to the position of the SNPs of the invention.<br>
For example, the sense and antisense nucleotide sequences for the PCR amplification primers can be, respectively: SEQ ID NO. 4: Sense primer: TTCAAGGTTACCCATCTCAA SEQ ID NO. 5: Antisense primer: TTAGTCAATCAGGATCATTGC<br>
The nucleotide sequences permit amplification of a fi:agment having a length of 655 nucleotides, from nucleotide 591 to nucleotide 1245 in the nucleotide sequence SEQ ID NO. 1.<br>
A statistical analysis of the frequency of each allele (allelic frequency) encoded by the gene comprising the SNP in the population of individuals is then achieved, which permits determination of the importance of their impact and their distribution in the<br><br>
different sub-groups and notably, if necessary, the diverse ethnic groups that constitute this population of individuals.<br>
The genotyping data are analyzed in order to estimate the distribution frequency of the different alleles observed in the studied populations. The calculations of the allelic frequencies can be carried out with the help of software such as SAS-suite® (SAS) or SPLUS® (MathSoft), The comparison of the allelic distributions of a SNP of the invention across different ethnic groups of the population of individuals can be carried out by means of the software ARLEQUIN® and SAS-suhe®.<br>
SNPs of the invention as genetic markers.<br>
Whereas SNPs modifying functional sequences of genes (e.g. promoter, splicing sites, coding region) are likely to be directly related to disease susceptibility or resistance, all SNPs (functional or not) may provide valuable markers for the identification of one or several genes involved in these disease states and, consequently, may be indirectly related to these disease states (See Cargill et al. (1999). Nature Genetics 22:231-238; Riley et al. (2000). Pharmacogenomics 1:39-47; Roberts L. (2000). Science 287: 1898-1899).<br>
Thus, the present invention also concerns a databank comprising at least one of the following SNPs: g771c, 808Ins(a), in a polynucleotide of the IFNα-17 gene.<br>
It is well understood that said SNPs are numbered in accordance with the nucleotide sequence SEQ ID NO. I.<br>

The dosage of a polypeptide and of the other compounds of the invention, useful as active agent, depends on the choice of the compound, the therapeutic indication, the mode of administration, the nature of the formulation, the nature of the subject and the judgment of the doctor.<br>
When it is used as active agent, a polypeptide according to the invention is generally administered at doses ranging between 1 and 15 M lU (International Unit).

EXPERIMENTAL SECTION<br>
Example 1: Modeling of a protein encoded by a polynucleotide of nucleotide sequence containing SNP G45R and of the protein encoded by the nucleotide sequence of the wild-type reference gene<br>
In a first step the three-dimensional structure of IFNα-17 was constructed starting from that of IFNα-2 whose structure is available in the PDB database (code IITF) and by using the software Modeler (MSI, San Diego, CA).<br>
The mature polypeptide fragment was then modified in such a fashion as to reproduce the mutation G45R.<br>
A thousand molecular minimization steps were conducted on this mutated firagment by using the programs AMBER and DISCOVER (MSI: Molecular Simulations Inc.),<br>
Two molecular dynamic calculation runs were then carried out with the same program and the same force fields.<br>
In each case, 50,000 steps were calculated at 300°K, terminated by 300 equilibration steps.<br>
The result of this modeling is visualized on Figures lA and IB.<br><br>
Example 2. Expression of natural wild-type IFNα-17 and G45R mutated IFNα-17 in yeast<br>
a)	Cloning of the natural wild-type IFNα-17 and mutated IFNα-17 in the eukarvote<br>
expression vector pPicZa-topo<br>
The nucleotide sequences coding for the mature part of the natural wild-type<br>
IFNα-17 and G45R mutated IFNα-17 are amplified by PCR using as template genomic<br>
DNA from an individual who is heterozygote for the SNP.<br>
The PCR primers permitting such an amplification are:<br>
SEQ ID NO. 6: Sense primer: TGTGATCTGCCTCAGACCCAC<br>
SEQ ID NO. 7: Antisense primer: TCAATCCTTCCTCCTTAATATTTTTTGC<br>
The PCR products are inserted in the eukaryote expression vector pPicZa-<br>
TOPO under the control of the hybrid promoter AOXl  inducible by methanol<br>
(JOPO™-cIonmg; Invitrogen Corp,).<br>
This vector permits the heterologous expression of eukaryote proteins in the<br>
yeast Pichia pastoris.<br>
After checking of the nucleotide sequence of the region of the vector coding for<br>
the recombinant proteins, the vector is linearized by the Pmel restriction enzyme, and<br>
the P. pastoris yeast strain (Invitrogen)  is  transformed with these recombinant<br>
expression vectors.<br>
b)	Heterologous expression in P. pastoris and purification of the wild-type IFNα-17 and<br>
G45R mutated IFNα-17 proteins<br>
Two saturated pre-cultures of 50 mL of BMGY medium (2% Peptone, 1% yeast extract, 1.34% YNB, 1% Glycerol, 100 mM potassium phosphate, 0.4 mg/Liter biotin pH 6.0) containing a clone coding for wild-type IFNα-17 protein or that coding for G45R mutated IFNα-17 protein, were carried out for 24-48 hours at 30o'C at an agitation of 200 rotations per minute (rpm).<br>
When the culture reaches a saturating cellular density (corresponding to an optical density of 12 measured at a wavelength of 600 nm), it is used to inoculate, at 5 OD/mL, 250 mL of BMMY medium (2% Peptone, 1% yeast extract, 1.34% YNB, 0.5%<br><br>
Methanol, 100 mM potassium phosphate, 0.4 mg/Liter biotin pH 6.0).<br>
The expression of the protein is then induced by methanol at a final concentration of 1%, for 24 hours at 30 oC, with an agitation of the culture flask at 180<br>
rpm.<br>
Due to the presence of the signal peptide sequence of the "alpha factor",<br>
upstream of the coding sequence, the proteins, are secreted by the yeasts in the culture<br>
medium. The alpha factor is naturally cleaved during the processing.<br>
The suspension is centrifuged and the protein is purified by HPLC starting from the obtained supernatant.<br>
In a pre-started step, an ultrafiltration (Labscale, cut-off 5000Da, Millipore) followed by a dialysis permits a ten times concentration of the yeast supernatant in a buffer of 50 mM Tris-Cl pH 9.0,25 mM NaCl.<br>
The first chromatographic step permits protein recovery by affinity on a blue sepharose column (Amersham Pharmacia). The presence of the protein in the collected fractions is verified, on the one hand by electrophoresis of SDS PAGE type and on the other hand by immuno-detection by a specific antibody directed against the IFNα-17 protein. At this step, the purity of the protein of interest is higher than 75%.<br>
In a second purification step, a gel filtration permits buffer exchange of the collected fractions corresponding to IFNα-17 proteins against 50 mM Tris pH 9.0, 25 mM NaCL<br>
The last step of the purification consists of a separation of the proteins on an ion exchange chromatography column.<br>
The fractions containing the recombinant protein are injected on an anion exchange column (ResourceQ 6.0 mL, Pharmacia) equilibrated beforehand in Tris 50 mM pH 9, NaCl 25 mM buffer. The elution of the proteins is carried out by the migration of a gradient between 0,025 and 1 M NaCl in the Tris 50 mM pH 9 buffer.<br>
The purity of the protein of interest is estimated on SDS/PAGE gel and the protein concentrations were measured by densitometry (Quantity one, Biorad) and BCA assay (bicinchoninic acid and copper sulfate, Sigma).<br>
Purified wild-type IFNα-17 and G45R mutated IFNα-17 proteins obtained according to this protocol, eventually scaled-up to produce higher amount of proteins,<br><br>
are used for the functional tests described below.<br>
Example 3. Evaluation of immunomodulatory activitv of natural wild-type IFNα-17 and G45R mutated IFNα-17<br>
IFNs type I (TEN alpha and IFN beta) are able to modulate certain functions of the immune system. They have been demonstrated to increase the dendritic cells (DC) maturation: increase in the expression of MHC class I (HLA- ABC) and II (HLA-DR) molecules, increase in the expression of the molecules involved in the co-stimulation of the T-lymphocytes, CD80, CD86 and CD83 molecules and increase in the stimukting function of T-lymphocytes.<br>
a)        Effect of G45R mutated IFNα-17 on dendritic cell maturation.<br>
Immunomodulatory activity of G45R mutated IFNα-17 was first investigated on dendritic cells maturation and compared to that of wild-type IFNα-2 chosen as representative of commercial Intron A product.<br>
To do so, dendritic cells were first generated from adult peripheral blood monocytes cultivated in the presence of GM-CSF and IL-4 cytokines. After purification using a CD 14+ cells purification kit, these dendritic cells were placed in presence of 100 ng/mL of wild-type IFNα-2 or G45R mutated IFNα-17 and their phenotype was determined by FACS analysis aiming at looldng for the expression of the MHC class I and II molecules and the CD40, CD80, CD86, CD83 and CDla markers. The maturation state of these dendritic cells has also been compared to that obtained without IFNα treatment, to provide a control with non-stimulated dendritic cells.<br>
The median value of the measures of fluorescence intensity for each marker and for the three experimental conditions, expressed as arbitrary unit, are presented in the following table:<br><br><br>
The results of this test demonstrate that the G45R mutated IFNα-17 protein is able to stimulate dendritic cell maturation.<br>
b)        Effect of G45R mutated IFNα-17 on cytokine release by T lymphocytes<br>
Immunomodulatory activity of G45R mutated IFNα-17 was also investigated by measuring cytokine release by T lymphocytes placed in presence of mutated IFNα-17 protein and with or without a strong antigen (SEB) in order to mimic an immune response against an aggression. This test was also performed in presence of wild-type IFNα-2 used as control and chosen as representative of the Intron A commercial product.<br>
To do so, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were isolated from healthy donors and stimulated for 16 hours in an appropriate medium containing anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies or SEB. In each culture was added 4 |ig/mL of wild-type IFNα-2 or G45R mutated IFNα-17. After stimulation, T lymphocytes were extracellularly labelled with anti-CD3, anti-CD4 and anti-CD69 antibodies or anti-CD3, anti-CD8 and anti-CD69 antibodies, and intracellularly labelled vdth specific antibodies directed against Thl-type cytokines (IFN-gamma) or Th2-type cytokines (IL-10). Fluorescent cells were analysed using FACScalibur and CellQuest software.<br>
The results obtained indicate that G45R mutated IFNα-17 and wild-type IFNα-2 do not stimulate IL-10 and IFN-gamma release and, thus, do not activate T lymphocytes in absence of SEB.<br>
In contrast, G45R mutated IFNα-17 and wild-type IFNα-2 stimulate cytokines<br><br>
(IL-10 and IFN-gamma) release by SEB-activated T-lymphocytes as shown in the table below. This table represents the cytokine release by T-lymphocytes in presence of SEB, expressed as percentage of the CD4-f CD69+ cells or CD8+ CD69-- cells for the CD4-f T-lymphocytes and CD8+ T-lymphocytes, respectively, and the percentage of CD69+ cells on total cells.<br><br>
These results clearly demonstrate that G45R mutated IFNα-17 strongly stimulates cytokine release (IFN gamma and IL-10) by CD4+ T-lymphocytes and CD8+ T-lymphocytes previously activated by SEB antigen. In this test, the interferon gamma production by CD4+ T-lymphocytes is higher in presence of G45R mutated IFNα-17 than in presence of wild-type IFNα-2 and the interferon gamma and IL-10 production by CD8+ T-lymphocytes is higher in presence of G45R mutated IFNα-17 than in presence of wild-type IFNα-2.<br>
c)        Effect of G45R mutated IFNα-17 on cytokine release by monocytes<br>
Finally, immunomodulatory activity of G45R mutated IFNα-17 was investigated by measuring cytokine release by monocytes in absence or in presence of a bacterial toxic agent (LPS). This test was also performed in presence of wild-type IFNα-2 used as control and chosen as representative of the Intron A commercial product.<br>
To do so, human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were isolated from healthy donors and their phenotype was analyzed to determine the relative amount of CD64+ CD4dim cells (CD64 and CD4dim are markers for blood monocytes). After<br><br>
an over-night culture, these PBMC were incubated in the culture medium alone (not stimulated cells) or in presence of LPS (stimulated cells). In each culture, 4 |ag/mL of wild-type IFNα-2 or G45R mutated IFNα-17 was added. After culture, cells were extracellularly labelled with anti-CD64 and anti-CD4dim, and intracellularly labelled with specific antibodies directed against Thl-type cytokines (TNF-alpha), IL-12 and IL-10.<br>
Fluorescent cells were analyzed using FACScalibur and CellQuest software.<br>
The results obtained indicate that G45R mutated IFNα-17 and wild-type IFNα-2 do not stimulate cytokines (IL-10, IL-12 and TNF-alpha) release in absence of LPS ^<br>
In contrast, in presence of LPS, monocytes release cytokines. The IL-10 and IL-12 release by monocytes in presence of LPS is further increased in presence of wild-type IFNα-2 but not in presence of G45R mutated IFNα-17 as shown in the table below. This table represents cj^okine release by monocytes in presence of LPS, expressed as percentage of the CD64+ CD4dim cells, and the percentage of CD4dim CD64+ cells on total cells.<br><br>
Thus, the absence of synergetic effect observed in presence of G45R mutated IFNα-17 and LPS suggests that G45R mutated IFNα-17 may have an immunosuppressive action.<br>
Example 4. Evaluation of in vitro antiproliferative activity of G45R mutated IFNα-17 on the TF-1 erythroleukemia cell line<br>
The effect of G45R mutated IFNα-17 was also evaluated on TF-1 erythroleukemia cell line. This test was also performed in presence of wild-type IFNα-2 used as control and chosen as representative of the Intron A commercial product.<br><br>
To do so, TF-1 cells were placed in contact of increasing concentrations of mutated IFNα-21 or wild-type IFNα-2 (0.001 to 1000 ng/mL) and the cell proliferation measured.<br>
The results, presented in Figure 2, indicate that the G45R mutated IFNα-17 has a weak antiproliferative effect on TF-1 cells, and this effect is similar to that of wild-type IFNα-2, suggesting that the G45R mutated IFNα-17's hematologic toxicity is not superior than that of wild-type IFNα-2.<br>
Example 5. Evaluation of the capacity of G45R mutated IFNα-17 to induce the anti-proliferation of the human Daudi Burkitt's lymphoma cell line<br>
These tests are carried out on two different IFNα-17 proteins, namely G45R mutated IFNα-17 and natural wild-type IFNα-17, Cells (human Daudi Burkitt's lymphoma cell line, hereinafter called "Daudi cells") cultivated beforehand in a RPMI 1640 medium (supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 2 mM of L-Glutamine) are inoculated in 96 well plates at the cellular density of 4.104 cells/ well.<br>
In each well, Daudi cells are placed in contact of increasing concentrations of: either natural wild-type IFNα-17 or G45R mutated IFNα-17 proteins.<br>
The concentrations of IFNα-17 studied (natural wild-type or mutated protein) are included between 0.003 pM and 600 nM (final concentrations in the wells).<br>
The Daudi cells are then incubated for 66 h at 37 °C under 5% CO2 after which the Uptiblue reagent (Uptima) is added to the cultures. The rate of cell proliferation is quantified by measuring the fluorescence emitted at 590nm (excitation 560nm) after an additional period of incubation of 4 hours.<br>
The anti-proliferative activity of natural wild-type IFNα-17 or G45R mutated IFNα-17 is based on the measurements of the IC50, corresponding to the concentration of IFNα-17 protein, in picomolar (pM), inhibiting 50 % of cellular growth.<br>
Four similar experiments were carried out, each being repeated four times. For each experiment, the IC50 values are mentioned in the following table:<br><br><br>
The average IC50 value measured for the wild-type IFNα-17 is 0.49 pM, whereas the average IC50 value measured for the G45R mutated IFNα-17 is 5.31 pM. Thus, the average ratio corresponding to the value of the IC50 for the mutated IFNα-17 over the value for the natural wild-type IFNα-17 reaches 10.80 (with a standard deviation of 3.46).<br>
This test demonstrates that the cellular antiproliferative activity is strongly inhibited (approximately in a range comprised between 5 to 15 times less) in the case of G45R mutated IFNα-17 by comparison with wild-type IFNα-17.<br>
Similar independent experiments have also been performed with wild-type IFNα-2 in order to compare the antiproliferative effect of G45R mutated IFNα-17 on Daudi cells proliferation v^th the effect of wild-type IFNα-2. To do so, Daudi cells were cultivated in the presence of concentrations of G45R mutated IFNα-17 or wild-type IFNα-2 ranging from 0.001 to 10 ng/mL.<br>
Three similar experiments were carried out. The results of one representative experiment are presented in Figure 3.<br>
These results demonstrate that the cellular antiproliferative activity of G45R mutated IFNα-17 on Daudi Burkitt's cell line is higher than that of wild-type IFNα-2.<br>
Example 6. Evaluation of the antiviral activitv of G45R mutated IFNα-17<br>
The IFNs play an important role in the antiviral defence. The IFN antiviral<br>
activity is partly due to IFNs induced enzymatic systems, such as:<br>
The 2'5' oligoadenylate synthetase, an enzyme which catalyzes the adenosine<br><br>
oligomere synthesis. These oligomeres activate the RNase L, an endoribonuclease which destroy the viral RNA once activated.<br>
the Mx proteins (GTPases) wliich inhibit the synthesis and/or the maturation of viral transcripts. This activity is mainly exerted on the influenza virus.<br>
The PKR protein (or p68 kmase) which is activated by the double-stranded RNA. The activated PKR inhibits protein synthesis.<br>
The IFNs antiviral activity is also induced by other mechanisms such as, in the case of retroviruses, the inhibition of viral particles entry into the cells, the replication, the binding, the exit of the particles and the infective power of viral particles.<br>
Finally, the IFNs exert an indirect antiviral activity by modulating certain functions of the immune system, in particular by favoring the response to cellular mediation (including an increase of the MHC class I and II molecules, increase of IL-12 and IFN-gamma production, increase of the CTL activities, among others).<br>
The antiviral activity of G45R mutated IFNα-17 has been evaluated both in vitJ'o in cell culture and in vivo in mouse model. Both tests have been carried out in parallel with wild-type IFNα-2 used as control and chosen as representative of the Intron A commercial product.<br>
a)        Antiviral activity in vitro in cell culture<br>
This assay permits evaluation of the antiviral activity of G45R mutated IFNα-17 and wild-type IFNα-2 in cell culture using the vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV).<br>
To do so, WISH human epithelial cells are cultivated for 24 hours in the presence of decreasing concentrations of G45R mutated IFNα-17 or wild-type IFNα-2. Then, the cells are infected by the virus of vesicular stomatitis (VSV) during 24 to 48 additional hours and the cell lysis is measured.<br>
The antiviral effect of the different IFNα tested is determined by comparing the IC50 value corresponding to the IFN concentration inhibiting 50% of cell lysis induced by the VSV.<br>
A similar experiment has been carried out two times, and the IC50 values measured in one representative experiment are presented in the following table:<br><br>
	Wild-type IFNα-2	G45R mutated IFNα-17<br>
IC50 (ng/mL)	4	2<br>
Thus, in cell culture infected with VSV, the G45R mutated IFNα-17 exhibits an antiviral activity, this antiviral activity being higher than that of wild-type IFNα-2.<br>
b)        Antiviral activity in vivo in mouse model<br>
This test in vivo is performed in EMCV (Encephalomyocarditis virus) mouse model.<br>
Human IFNs exhibit dose-dependent antiviral activity in the mouse which is in general 100 to 1,000 fold less than that exhibited by the same amount of mouse IFN (Meisteretal. (1986). J. Gen. Virol. 67, 1633-1644).<br>
Intraperitoneal injection of mice with Encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) gives rise to a rapidly progressive fatal disease characterized by central nervous system involvement and encephalitis (Finter NB (1973). Front Biol 2: 295-360). Mouse and human interferon-alpha have both been shown to be effective in protecting mice against lethal EMCV infection (Tovey and Maury (1999). J. IFN Cytokine Res. 19: 145-155).<br>
Groups of 20, six-week old Swiss mice were infected intraperitoneally (ip) with 100 X LD50 EMCV and treated one hour later, and then once daily for 3 days thereafter<br>
with 2 μg of G45R mutated IFNα-17 or wild-type IFNα-2 preparations. A control group was performed with animals having been treated with excipient only. The animals were followed daily for survival for 21 days.<br>
Results are presented in Figure 4 and indicate that the relative survival rate of the mice which have been treated with G45R mutated IFNα-17 is much higher than the survival rate of the non-treated mice, and even higher that that observed for the mice which have been treated with wild-type IFNα-2. These data demonstrate the strong antiviral activity of G45R mutated IFNα-17 in vivo in mouse model.<br>
All of these results demonstrate that G45R mutated IFNα-17 possesses unique biological properties.<br><br><br><br>
