INK  CONTAINER AND IKK JET   RECORDING SYSTEM<br>
FIELD OF THE IHVENTION AND RELATED ART<br>
The present invention relates to an ink container and an ink jet recording system. Specifically, the present invention relates to an   ink container and an   ink jet recording system which employ a constitution for efficiently guiding light, emitted from a light emitting member such as an LED provided to the ink container, to an operating portion (display portion) of a lever for operation.<br>
In recent years, which widespread use of digital imaging equipment such as digital camera (hereinafter referred to as "digital equipment"), such a style that data transmission is performed by directly connecting the digital equipment with a printer or directly mounting a recording medium for the digital equipment such as a memory card in the printer without through a personal computer (PC) to effect recording, i.e., so-called non-PC recording, is increasing.<br>
With respect to an ink container mountable to the printer used in such an environment, in order to improve handleability thereof by a user, e.g., a technique disclosed in Japanese Laid-Open Patent Application (Jp-A&gt; 2006-142484 is employed.  In the technique, the light emitting member such as LED<br><br>
(hereinafuer referred zo   as "LED" or "light emitting portion") is disposed with respect to the ink container so that the user can confirm a state of the ink container mounted on the printer by visual observation.  JP-A 2006-142484 discloses, as one of embodiments, utilization of light emission at the light emitting portion as a means for transmitting a state of the ink container to the user.<br>
Further, such a constitution that light from the light emitting portion disposed with respect to the ink container is guided to a position different from a position in which the light emitting portion is disposed is proposed.  For example, JP-A 2006-142796 discloses a constitution for guiding light emitted from an LED to a desired position in the case where a position in which the LED is disposed is restricted. In JP-A 2006-142196, such a constitution that B light receiving portion for receiving the light from the LED is disposed to face the LED and a light guide member for guiding the received light to a display portion for outputting the light to effect display is disclosed.  The light guide member disclosed in JP-A 2006-142796 is provided to the ink container as an independent structure.<br>
As the constitution of the light guide member, in addition to the above-described independent structure, such a constitution that an operating lever<br><br>
i~self utilized zor mounting the ink container is used so that an operating portion of the operating lever is used as a dispjay portion is disclosed in JP-A 2006-116785.<br>
Further, JP-A 2007-1212 discloses such a constitution that a substrate to which a light emitting portion is provided is equipped with a light guide member as a unit and the unit is disposed with respect to an ink container.  JP-A 2007-1212 also discloses a constitution in which a light display portion is used as an operating portion of an operating lever and the operating lever connecting a light receiving portion with the display portion is utilized as the light guide member.<br>
By using the light guide member as described above, it is possible to determine disposition (arrangement) of the light emitting portion and the display portion with a certain degree of design latitude.  Further, such a light guide member is constituted to cover the light emitting portion, so that the light from the light emitting portion can be transmitted to the display portion while retaining a sufficient amount of light (light amount).<br>
In either of the above-described constitutions disclosed in JP-A 20O6-142484, JP-A 2006-142796, JP-A 2006-116785 and JP-A 2007-1212, the LED as the light emitting portion and the light receiving portion are<br><br>
Qisposea with a certain gap (spacing).  Intensify of light cutputted from the display portion, i.e., the light amount varies depending on a distance between the LED as the light emitting member and the light receiving portion of the light guide member in the case where the materials constituting the light guide member are the same.<br>
Here, a relationship between the amount of light entering the light receiving portion and the distance between the light receiving portion and the LED (light emitting portion) will be described with reference to Figures 10(a) and 10(b) which are schematic views.  Figures 10(a) shows a constitution in which a light emitting portion 51a for isotropically emitting light in a planar shape is disposed and a light receiving portion 33a of the light guide member 36 is disposed with a distance r from the light emitting portion 51a.  An amount of light, of light emitted from the light emitting portion 51a, received by the light receiving portion 33a is represented by Sa/4nr2 where Sa represents an area of the light receiving portion 33a.  On the other hand. Figure 10(b) shows a constitution in which the light receiving portion 33a placed in the state shown in Figure 10(a) has approached a position with a distance 1/2 from the light emitting portion 51a.  In this case, an amount of light reaching the light receiving portion 33a is<br><br>
represented by Sa/4nr (1/2; 2 .  Thai: is, the amount of the light reaching the light receiving portion 33a is inversely proportional to the square of the distance r, so that the amount of the light received by the light receiving portion is increased by decreasing the distance between the light emitting portion and the light receiving portion.  When the light guide member 36 is under the same condition, the amount of the light guided to the display portion is increased with a shorter (decreased) distance between the light emitting portion and the light receiving portion.<br>
That is, when the distance between the light emitting portion and the light receiving portion is large, the light from the light emitting portion cannot be sufficiently guided to the display portion, with the result that the light amount at the display portion is insufficient in some cases.  On the other hand, it is easily conceivable that the light emitting portion and the light receiving portion are disposed so that the light receiving portion for receiving light from the light emitting portion is brought near to the light emitting portion as close as possible for the purpose of ensuring the light amount.  From this viewpoint, e.g., as disclosed in JP-A 2006-142796, such a constitution that the substrate provided with the light emitting portion is disposed with respect to the ink container and the light receiving portion of<br><br>
"cne light guide merabe:: is disposed at a position opposite to the light emitting portion is employed as a preferred constitutional embodimenc.<br>
However, in the case where the attiount of the received light is intended to be increased by disposing the light emitting portion and the light receiving portion of the light guide member so as to be closer to each other, it is necessary to constitute the light guide member with high accuracy.  Failure to do so may cause breakage of the light emitting portion due to excessive approach of the light receiving portion of the light guide member to the light emitting portion, when the light emitting portion is attached to the ink container, resulting in contact between the light emitting portion and the light receiving portion.  Incidentally, when the LED and the 1ight receiving port i on a re confi nnred to keep a manufacturing satisfy distance in order to obviate such a situation, there is a possibility that the light emitting portion and the light receiving portion are moved apart from each other, thus failing to provide an expected light amount.<br>
Further, even in the case where the light emitting portion is manufactured with high accuracy and is attached to the ink container safety, there is also a possibility that such an unexpected situation that the attached light emitting portion and the light<br><br>
receiving portion of rhe lignt guide member contaci: each other to oreak the LED due to an impact or the like caused, e.g., in the case of falling of the ink container during transportation or the like occurs. When various factors such as safety and manufacturing easiness are taken into consideration, the light emitting portion and the light receiving portion cannot be disposed excessively closely to each other. That is, ensuring of the light amount and protection of the LED have a trade-off relationship.<br>
As another means for increasing the amount of light received by the light receiving portion, the light guide member may be formed in a large thickness to increase an area of the light receiving portion. For example, as disclosed in JP-A 2007-1212, in the case where a substrate unit provided with the light emittiriQ portion and the light guide meiriber is disposed in the neighborhood of a supporting point portion of an operating lever to constitute a display portion, the neighborhood of the supporting point portion of the light, itself constitutes an optical path (see, e.g., Figure 10 of JP-A 2007-1212).  In the case, the thickness of the supporting point portion of the operating lever is increased to result in an increased operating force of the lever.  Further, in the neighborhood of the supporting point portion of the operating lever constituted to have the large<br><br>
nhickness, the supporting poinr portion is deforced ro becoiue white in some cases, so that a light-guidir.c property can be lowered by the deformation.  In this regard, there is a possibility that the white deformation at the supporting point portion of the operating lever occurs similarly in the constitution disposed in JP-A 2006-116785.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVEHTION<br>
A principal object of the present invention is to provide an ink. container, for notifying a user of a state of an ink container by utilizing light emission from a light emitting portion such as an LED, capable of realizing not only such a constitution that a sufficient amount of light can be transmitted to a display portion with a simple structure without risking the above-described possibilit ies but also good protection of the light emitting portion such as the LED while avoiding risks which can occur during manufacturing, transportation, or the like.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide an ink jet recording system capable of effectively utilizing such an ink container.<br>
The present invention has been accomplished by focusing attention on such a point that a supporting member which is provided to the ink container and constitutes an operating lever utilized when the ink<br><br>
container is mounted and fixed to a holder is displaced before and after the mounting of the ink container to the holder.<br>
That is, by utilizing the displacement of the supporting member so as to approach the ink container by the mounting of the ink container to the holder, when a light guide member is provided to the supporting member, a light receiving portion of the light guide member is constituted so that the light receiving portion relatively moves apart from the LED in a state before the light receiving portion of the light guide member is mounted and relatively approaches the LED by the mounting thereof.<br>
According to an aspect of the present invention, there is provided an ink container for retaining ink, comprising:<br>
an ink containing body;<br>
an elastically displaceable supporting member;<br>
a light emitting portion;<br>
a light receiving portion for receiving light from the light emitting portion;<br>
a display portion for displaying the received light; and<br>
a light guide portion for optically connecting the light receiving portion and the display portion so as to guide the light received by the receiving portion to the display portion.<br><br>
wnereiri the S'jpporting merriber at least partly functions as the light guide portion,<br>
wherein the light receiving portion is located, with a gap with respect to the light emitting portion, so as to cover the light emitting portion,<br>
wherein the light receiving portion approaches the light emitting portion when the supporting member approaches the ink containing body by being subjected to urging toward the ink containing body, and<br>
wherein the light receiving portion moves apart from the light emitting portion when the supporting member moves apart from the ink containing body by being released from the urging toward the ink containing body.<br>
According to another aspect of the present invention, there is provided an ink container for retaining ink, comprising:<br>
an ink containing body;<br>
an elastically displaceable supporting member;<br>
a light emitting portion;<br>
a light receiving portion for receiving light from said light emitting portion; and<br>
a display portion for displaying the received light,<br>
wherein said light guide portion is provided with a light guide portion for optically connecting said light receiving portion and said display portion<br><br>
30 =s ::c g'lice the light received by said receiving portion to said display portion,<br>
v;herein said light receiving portion is located, with a gap with respect to said light emitting portion, so as to cover said light emitting portion,<br>
wherein said light receiving portion approaches said light emitting portion when said supporting member approaches said ink containing body by being subjected to urging toward said ink containing body, and<br>
wherein said light receiving portion moves apart from said light emitting portion when said supporting member moves apart from said ink containing body by being released from the urging toward said ink containing body.<br>
Accordina to a further aspect of the present invention, there is provided an ink jet recording system for effecting recording by ejecting ink from a recording head, comprising:<br>
an ink container;<br>
a recording head for ejecting ink supplied from the ink container; and<br>
a holder to which the ink container is mountable,<br>
wherein the ink container comprises an ink containing body, a light emitting portion, a light<br><br>
12<br><br>
gu 1 a<br>
e portion for receiving light fro::a the lighx emitting portion and guiding the received light to a display portion, and a supporting member which is provided with the light guide portion and is displaceable by being mounted to the holder, and<br>
wherein the light receiving portion approaches the light emitting portion by displacement of the supporting member toward the ink containing body caused by mounting of the ink container to the holder.<br>
According to a still further aspect of the present invention, there is provided an ink jet recording system for effecting recording by ejecting ink from a recording head, comprising:<br>
an ink container;<br>
a recording head for ejecting ink supplied from said ink container; and<br>
a holder to which said ink container is mountable,<br>
wherein said ink container comprises an ink containing body, a light emitting portion, a light guide portion for receiving light from the light emitting portion and guiding the received light to a display portion, and a supporting member which at least partly functions as the light guide portion and is displaceable by being mounted to the holder, and<br>
wherein the light receiving portion approaches<br><br>
saic. Light, emitting portion by displacement<br>
of said supporting m.ember toward said ink containing<br>
body caused by mounting of said ink container to the<br>
holder.<br>
According to the above-described constitution, before the ink container is mounted to the holder, the ink container and the supporting mem,ber relatively move apart from each other, so that the light receiving portion of the light guide member provided to the supporting member is located apart from the LED or the like constituting the light emitting portion. When the ink container is mounted to the holder, the supporting member approaches the ink container.  At the same time, the light receiving portion of the light guide member approaches the light emitting portion. As a result, when the supporting member is configured to relatively move apart from the ink container, e.g., during ink container manufacturing, the light receiving portion of the light guide member is also located apart from the LED, so that it is possible to reduce a degree of dangerousness such as breakage during assembling of a substrate provided with the LED. Further, when the ink container is mounted to the holder, the light receiving portion of the light guide member approaches the LED with displacement of the supporting member, so that most of light from the light emitting portion can be caused to enter the<br><br>
lighr receiving portion and -herefore it is possible ~o ensure a large value as an arr.ount of light outputted at the display portion.<br>
Further, also by an impact unnecessarily exerted on the ink container, such as falling, during handling of the ink container before the ink container is mounted to the holder, the LED as the light emitting portion and the light receiving portion of the light guide member are placed in a mutually separated state, so that the LED and the light receiving portion less contact each other and particularly it is possible to prevent damage of the light emitting portion.  Further, the LED as the light emitting portion and the light receiving portion of the light guide member are configured so as to ensure the mutually separated state when the supporting member is di spl aced at a maximum level, so that reliability with respect to protection of the LED from an external impact is further improved.<br>

DETATLED DESCRTPTTCIN OF THF, PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Hereinbelow, embodiments of the present invention will be described with reference to the<br>
drawings.<br>
{First Embodiment)<br>
Figure 1, Figures 2(a) to 2(d), and Figure 3 are views showing a schematic structure of an ink container according to First Embodiment of the present invention.  Figure 1 is a sectional side view taken along A-A line indicated in Figure 2(d) and Figure 3 is a sectional side view taken along B-B line<br><br>
maica-ed in Figure 2(a).  -igures 2(a), 2(b), 2(c), and 2(a) are a top plan viev;, a side view, a front view, and a bottom view, respectively, of the ink container.  Herein, a front surface (side) of the ink container is a surface (side) which is faced to the user who is manipulating the ink container (mounting and demounting operation of the ink container), which provides the user with information (by light emission of LED which will be described hereinafter).<br>
In Figure 1, an ink container 1 is constituted by being provided with, as principal surfaces, a front surface la provided with an operating lever 30 utilized for the mounting and demounting operation of the ink container (hereinafter referred to as a "supporting member"), a rear surface lb opposite from the front surface la, a bottom surface Ic provided vjith an ink supply port (also referred to as a "lower surface" as a matter of convenience), a top (or upper) surface Id, and two side surfaces le and If connecting these surfaces.  The supporting member 30 is made of resin material integrally molded with an outer casing member of the ink container 1, and a portion 34 integrally connected with the outer casing member is supporting point portion during displacement.  The ink container 1 is provided on its rear surface lb side and front surface la side with a first engaging portion 21 and second engaging portion 32,<br><br>
respectively, v;nich are engageable with locking portions provided on an ink container holder 150 side which will he described hereinafter.  By engagement of the engaging portion 21 and the engaging portion 32 with the locking portions, a mounted state of the ink container 1 in rhe ink container holder 150 is ensured. In this embodiment, the second engaging portion 32 is integrally molded with the supporting member 30 as part of the supporting member 30.  The operation during the mounting will be described hereinafter referring to Figure 15.<br>
The bottom surface Ic of the ink container 1 is provided with an ink supply port 22 for ink supply, which port is connectable with an ink introduction opening of a recording head which will be described hereinafter, by mounting of the ink container 1 to the ink container holder 150.  A substrate 50 is provided in an inclined state on the bottom surface Ic side of the supporting point portion 34 of the supporting member 30 as a portion for connecting bottom surface Ic side and the front surface la side.  On the substrate 50, a light emitting portion such as the LED is disposed as described later.<br>
An inside of the ink container 1 is divided into an ink reservoir chamber 23 which is provided adjacent the front surface side, and an absorbing member accommodating chamber 24 which is provided<br><br>
aajacent rne rear surface side and which his in fluid cG~L:r.u.nication 'with the ink supply port 22.  These chambers 23 and 'lA   are in fluid conimunication with each other through a communication port 25.  The ink reservoir chamber 23 directly contains ink 2, whereas the absorbing member accommodating chamber 24 is provided with an (ink) absorbing material [e.g., fibrous absorbing members 41 and 42 using a porous member made of sponge, fibers or the like) for retaining the ink by impregnation.  The absorbing members 41 and 42 generate a proper negative pressure in a range in which the pressure is sufficient to provide balance with the force of meniscus formed in an ink ejection nozzle portion of the recording head to prevent ink leakage from the ink ejection portion to the outside and to permit an ink ejection operation of the recording head.<br>
On the top surface of the absorbing member accommodating chamber 24, an ambient air communication portion 11 for establishing communication of the absorbing member accommodating chamber 24 with ambient air is provided, so that the ambient air is introduced so as to relax the negative pressure increased by supply of the ink to the recording head and thus the negative pressure can be kept in a preferable pressure range.<br>
The internal structure of the ink container 1<br><br>
15 no" ^irr.irea zo such a par'i~ ioned strucrure in ■«T&gt;ich ^he inside is partitioned into the absorbing meiTLber accorrmodating chamber and the reservoir chamber containing the ink alone but may also be any structure. For example, the absorbing member may be filled in substantially all of the inside space of the ink container.  As a negative pressure generating means, the ink alone may be contained in a bladder-like member made of elastic material such as rubber or the like which produces tension in a direction of expanding the volume thereof, and the negative pressure is caused to act on the inside ink by the tension generated by the bladder-like member.  Further, at least a part of the ink accommodation space may be constituted by a flexible member, and the like is accommodated in the space, wherein a spring force is applied to the flexible member, by which a neqa"t"ive pressure is generated.  It is possible to use the ink container having a constitution used in the field of normal ink jet recording.<br>
The substrate 50 is, as shown in Figure 2(d), provided with electrode pads 52a to 52d which are disposed on a surface facing the outside of the ink container and permit electrical connection with a recording apparatus.  On the other hand, as shown in Figure 1, on the surface directed toward the inside of the ink container 1, a light emitting portion 51 for<br><br>
cj..:.^_i:,g v';.siD_e lighL. such as ..■n.D (hereinafter referred 1:0 as "LED" as a matter of convenience) and a control element (not shown} for controlling the light emission of the LED 51 are provided, so that the control element effects the light emission control of the LED 51 by an electric signal supplied through the electrode pads 52.  The substrate 50 is also provided with a memory element on the same surface side as that where the LED 51 is provided.  In this memory element, information on the color (type) of the ink contained in the ink container and a remaining ink amount based on a counted value of the number of ejection operations is stored.  The substrate 50 is, as shown in Figure 2(d), fixed to the outer casing member of the ink container by fixing members 53a and 53b.  In this embodiment, the fixing members 53a and 53b are a oin^lf^e mem.ber and are engaged in holes provided to the substrate 50 and then end portions of the fixing members 53a and 53b are swaged by thermo-fusion (melting) to be fixed.  The fixing method is not limited to the above method but may also be performed by bonding, fitting, or the like.<br>
In this fixed state, the LED 51 is, particularly as shown in Figure 1, disposed on the substrate 50 close to the supporting member 30.  In this embodiment, as shown in Figures 1 and 3, above the LED 51 disposed on the substrate 50, a casing of<br><br>
~ r.e m-; cor.t-ainer is cor-S^itut-ed so as not to be covered.  Furrher, above rhG 1.5D 51, as shown in Fioure 1, a base portion of the supporting member 30 is extended so as to cover over the LED 51 with a certain distance from the LED 51.  The extended portion over the LED 51 constitutes a light receiving portion 33 for receiving light emitted from the LED 51.  Then, the light received by the light receiving portion 33 is outputted from an operating portion 31 (constituting a display portion), and a portion connecting the light receiving portion 33 and the operating portion 31 constitutes a light guide portion 36.  The supporting member 36 is, particularly as shown in Figures 2(b) and 3, connected with the outer casing member of the ink container at two supporting point portions 34 located on both sides of the base portion of the supporting member 30.  A centra] nnrti on of the base portion of the supporting member 30 except for these supporting point portions is protruded, so that a part of an inner wall surface of the protruded portion constitutes the light receiving portion 36.<br>
As shown in Figure 3, with respect to the supporting member 30, when a thickness of a portion corresponding to the light receiving portion 33 and its extended portion is taken as L and a thickness of a portion corresponding to the supporting point portion 3*5 is ta.ken as 3^, L &gt; ]^ is satisfied, so that<br><br>
zr-B   zhickr.esses and difierent from each ocher. Particularly, as shown in Figures 1 and 3, the supporting member 30 is formed thickly at the central portion (a lower surface of which constitutes the light receiving portion covering the LED as described above! and thinly at both side portions corresponding to the supporting point portions 34.  The thick central portion of the supporting member 30 functions as the light guide portion 36 for guiding the light received by the light receiving portion 33 to the display portion as described above.<br>
The supporting member 30 can be displaced by being deformed in the neighborhood of the supporting point portions 34 when the ink container is mounted to the holder.  At this time, as described above, the thickness of the supporting point portions 34 located at the both side port i ons is configured to be small, so that a force for displacing the supporting member 30 by a user is reduced and thus it is possible to ensure facility of mounting and demounting of the ink container,<br>
Figure 4 is a perspective view showing an example of a recording head unit 105 for holding the ink container shown in Figures 1 to 3 in a detachably mountable manner.  Figures 5(a) and 5{b) are schematic views for illustrating a state immediately before the ink container 1 is mounted to the recording head unit<br><br>
_ ^3, ar.c 2 ^g'jres 6 (a; and 6 [D]    are schematic viev;s for Illustrating a sta^e in v;hich the in.
The recording head unit 105 is generally constituted by a holder 150 for detachably and mountably holding a plurality (four in Figure 4) of ink containers, and a recording head 106 disposed adj acent the bottom surface side (unshown in Figure 4 but shown in Figure 5(a)).  By mounting the ink container 1 to the holder 150, an ink introduction opening 107 of the recording head disposed adjacent the bottom surface portion of the holder is connected with the ink supply port 22 of the ink container to establish an ink communication path therebetween.<br>
An example of the recording head 105 comprises a liquid passage constituting a nozzle and an electrothermal transducer element pro^?ided in the liquid passage.  To the electrothermal transducer element, electrical pulses constituting recording signals are supplied, thus applying thermal energy to the ink.  By pressure during bubble generation (boiling) caused by a phase change of the ink at that time, the ink is ejected.<br>
When the ink container 1 is mounted to the recording head unit 105, the holder 150 is handled above the holder 150.  That is as shown in Figure 5(a), a first engaging portion 21 in the form of a<br><br>
pr^]ec„ion pre video en an   ink ocntair.er rear surface lb side is inserted into a first locking portion 155 in the forir^ of a through hole provided in a holder rear surface side, and in this state, the ink container 1 is placed on the bottom surface of the holder.  The resultant state is shown in Figure 5(b) as a perspective view.  The ink container is in an unmounted state and thus is illustrated in a raising state.  In this state, when the front side upper end of the ink container 1 is pressed down as indicated by an arrow P, the ink container 1 rotates about the engaging portion between the first engaging portion 21 and the first locking portion 155 of the holder as a rotational fulcrum, so that front side of the ink container is displaced downwardly.  In the process of this action, the supporting member 30 is displaced in the direction nf an arrow Q, wh ile a si de surface of a second engaging portion 32 provided in the supporting member 30 on the ink container front side is being pressed to a wall provided on the holder front side. That is, the supporting member 30 is rotationaily displaced about the supporting point portions 34. In the ink container mounting, then, the pressing down by the user in the direction of the arrow P is completed when the top surface of the second engaging portion 32 reaches a portion located below the second locking portion 156.  The supporting<br><br>
r.e!r_C5r ^^ is aisplaced in a direcrion of an arrow Q' cppcsiue ro the direction of the arrow Q by the elastic force of the supporting member 30, so that second engaging portion 32 is locked with the second locking portion 156.  This state is shown in Figures 6{a) and 6(b). The upward displacement of the ink container 1 is suppressed by the first locking portion 155 engaged with the first engaging portion 21 and by the second locking portion 156 engaged with the second engaging portion 32.  This state is a mounting completion state of the ink container 1, wherein the ink supply port 22 is connected with the ink introduction opening 107, and the electrode pads 52 are electrically connected with the connector 152.  In this state, the ink supply port 22 is pressed against the ink introduction opening 107 with a large force by the rotatinn nf the ink nontainer 1.  At the connecting portion between these port and opening, an elastic member such as a filter, an absorbing material, a packing or the like is provided for the purposes of assuring an ink communication property and preventing ink leakage there.<br>
In the ink container mounting completion state, the first locking portion 155 engaged with the first engaging portion 21 and the second locking portion 156 enqaged with the second engaging portion 32 prevent the ink container 1 from rising away from the holder.<br><br>
iTiereiore, tne rss^craT:icr-_ of "che elastic r?iember is suppressed, ana the member is kept in an appropriately elasrically deformed state.  On the other hand, the electrode pads 52 and connectors 152 which constitute electrical contacts are made of a relative high rigidity electroconductive material such as metal to ensure a good electrical connection property therebetween.  Then, rhe mounting of the ink container 1 is completed, the LED 51 can emit light in a state in which the electrode pads 52 of the substrate 50 and the connectors 152 are electrically connected with each other.<br>
In this state, as shown in Figure 6(a), the supporting member 30 is displaced toward the ink container side compared with a state before the mounting of the ink container 1, so that the light r:eceivina portion 33 is displaced toward the TJF-D ."SI side.  As a result, a distance between the light receiving portion 33 and the LED 51 is shorter than that before the ink container mounting.  As a result, the light from the LED 51 can be taken in the light receiving portion 33 in a larger amount.  The light taken in the light receiving portion 33 passes through the thick portion (LGP) 36, of the supporting member<br>
30, provided correspondingly to the light receiving portion 33 and reaches the operating portion 31<br>
(display portion).  Figure 6(b) schematically shows a<br><br>
-igr.z emission s~ate.  Tne user csn recognize iniormLation on tne ink container such as a remaining ink amount or an ink container-mounted state.<br>
As described above, according to this embodiment of the present invention, by employing such a constitution that the portion at one end surface of the supporting member is constituted as the light receiving portion and is opposite to the light emitting portion, the light receiving portion is displaceable so that the light receiving portion can approach the light emitting portion side by the mounting operation of the ink container.  As a result, most of the light from the light emitting portion can be caused to enter the light receiving portion, so that it is possible to transmit a sufficient amount of the light without using a separate member such as the light guide m.ember different from the supporting member.<br>
Incidentally, the supporting member 30 descried in this embodiment is constituted so as not to break the LED 51 even in the case where the supporting member 30 is displaced toward the front surface la of the ink container 1 at a maximum level. Figure 7 is a partially enlarged schematic view showing the supporting member 30 of the ink container 1 and its peripheral portion and showing displacement states of the supporting member 30.  The supporting<br><br>
TLe~cer Ju ir. a ncr~.c_ 3r,ate is iOcaLea at a position ir_ wnicn the iignt receiving portion 33 is most distant from the LED 51.  For that reason, in an operation for incorporating the substrate 50 provided with the LED 51 into the ink container, it is possible to avoid such a possibility that the light receiving portion 33 and the LED 51 contact each other to cause breakage.  When the ink container is mounted to the holder, the supporting member is displaced to a mounted state position in which the supporting member is indicated as a supporting member 30a.  At this time, the light receiving portion is placed in a state in which the light receiving portion approaches the LED (i.e., a light receiving portion 33a).  In this state, the light receiving portion 33a can effectively receive the light from the LED to guide the light to +-^^g displs" pcr^'ion.  The suDoorting m.eir.ber in a state in which the supporting member is displaced toward the ink container side at a maximum level is indicated as a supporting member 30b, e.g., in the case where the ink container falls during handling.  Also in this case, the surface of the light receiving portion 33 is constituted so that the light receiving portion 33 does not contact the LED 51 and the supporting member 30 is constituted so that part of the supporting member 30 contacts the ink container 1 before the light receiving portion 33 contacts the LED 51.<br><br>
3y employing the ccnstitu^ion as described aoove, nandieability of the ink container 1 can be easily realized with high reliability.<br>
Further, the supporting point portions at which the supporting member and the outer casing member of the ink container are connected with each other are portions other than the light receiving portion constituting a spacing therebetween and are formed in a thickness less than that of the light receiving portion.  As a result, it is possible to suppress an increase in force for displacing the supporting member by the ink container mounting while a portion corresponding to the light receiving portion is provided in a desired thickness.<br>
In the above-described embodiment, particularly, the ink container provided with the first enga^in^ portion 21 is described but the ink container to which the present invention is applicable is not necessarily required to be provided with such a constitution.  This is because, even in the case of no engaging portion 21, e.g., the ink. container can be mounted while part of the ink container on the rear surface side contacts a mounting portion of the ink container holder or the like during the ink container mounting and then the contact portion is moved. (Second Embodiment)<br>
Figures 8 (a) and 8(b) illustrate Second<br><br>
.^I.iCj; L, .<br>
Second Erribodiment is identical to First E:!ib)odiment except that a constitution of a second engaging portion 132 is different from the second engaging portion 32 in First Embodiment as shown in Figure 8(a).  In First Embodiment, the second engaging portion 32 is described as such a constitution that a single second engaging portion 32 is provided at a central portion of the supporting member.  On the other hand, in Second Embodiment, such a constitution that two second engaging portions 132 are provided on both end sides avoiding the central portion is employed•<br>
In the case of First Embodiment, the projection constituting the second engaging portion is present at the central portion constituting the light guide portion of the supporting member and therefore reflection of the light guided throuah the light auide portion is disturbed at the portion, so that there is a possibility of attenuation of the amount of light reaching the display portion.  The constitution in which such an attenuation of the light amount due to the disturbance in the light reflection is suppressed is employed in Second Embodiment.<br>
As shown in Figure 8(b), by deviating the projections constituting the second engaging portions 132 from a reflection path of the light at the light guide portion 36 of the supporting member 30, a<br><br>
rer_eCLicn surface 37a and a reflection surface 37b which are located at the central portion constituting the light guide portion 36 of the supporting member 30 can be constituted as parallel surfaces, so that unnecessary disturbance in reflection can be eliminated to provide a constitution for transmitting the light with a high degree of efficiency. (Third Embodiment)<br>
Figures 9(a) and 9(b) illustrate Third Embodiment.  In First and Second Embodiments, the structure of the central portion of the supporting member itself is made thic)
 <br>
r.ign-e^Iiciency -ich' .^ransmissicn can be achieved.<br>
The constitution of the light guide portion 38 shown m Figures 9(a) and 9(b) is merely as example and therefore m.odification of the constitution of the light guide portion within a range satisfying intent of this emi)odiment is embraced in this embodiment.<br>
In the constitution shown in Figures 9(a) and 9(b), an opening 39 is provided at the operating portion 31 of the supporting member 30 and constitutes the display portion for outputting the light from the light guide portion 38 mounted as the separate member, In this embodiment, in the case where the ink container constituent material is an opaque material, the light guided through the light guide portion 38 does not diffuse into the entire supporting member 30, so that only the surface of the light guide portion 38 v'sible th'cucrh the opening 3 9 em.its the 1 ight and the light does not diffuse into the adjacent supporting member for the ink container.  For that reason, viewability of the display portion is enhanced.<br>
In the above-described embodiments, the constitution in which the part of the supporting member is configured to function as the light guide portion 36 and the constitution in which the light guide member 38 is the separate member different from the supporting member 30 are described.<br>
In these constitutions, the light emitted from<br><br>
- ..= —— ^    J _ _ J<br>
:cr_venieni:^y described as light guided ^o ~n.e d^sp_ay portion through the light guide Dor tier, but a portion formed of a light-transmissive material functions as the light guide portion since the light passes through the portion formed of the light-transmissive material by its nature.<br>
In the above-described constitutions, a portion constituting a principal light path or a portion to be expected to constitute the principal light path is described as the light guide portion.<br>
The light path from the light-receiving portion to the display portion can be freely designed by appropriately combining shapes or materials capable of changing a refractive index of the light.  For example, it is possible to employ light paths from the light-receiving portion to the display portion as she v.'" ii Fi""ures 12(a) to 12(f) .<br>
In each of Figures 12(a) to 12(f), the light path of a member constituted by a first member (e.g., the supporting member) 100 and a second member (e.g., the light guide member) 101 is represented by an arrow 102.  A light-incident portion is the light -receiving portion and a light-outputting portion is the display portion.<br>
Figure 12 (a) shows a constitution in which the entire second member functions as the light guide member and the constitution described in Third<br><br>
^.^xcamen „ corresponas '^c  tnis constirution.  Figure i2(b; shows a constitution in v;hich the light passing through the second m.ember is changed in light path to the first member at an intermediary portion and the constitutions described in, e.g.. First Embodiment and Second Embodiment correspond to this constitution. Figure 12(c) shows a constitution in which the entire first member functions as the light guide member. Figure 12(d) shows a constitution in which the light path is changed from the first member to the second member.   Figure 12(e) shows a constitution in which the light path is changed from the second member to the first member and then is changed to the second member again.  Figure 12(g) shows a constitution in which the light path is changed from the first member to the second member and then is changed to the first<br>
In order to change the light path, e.g., a desired portion to be changed is configured to face an air layer, changed in material therefor, or utilize a<br>
mirror surface 103 or total reflection, thus changing the light path.<br>
Particularly, the constitutions shown in Figures 12(a) and 12(b) are, as described above in First to Third Embodiments, capable of being simply constituted and capable of guiding the light with reliability, thus being excellent in practicality.<br><br>
