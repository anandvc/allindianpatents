METHOD AND APPARATUS TO CONTROL CLUTCH PRESSURES IN<br>
AN ELECTRO-MECHANICAL TRANSMISSION<br>
CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
[0001]   This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application<br>
No. 60/982,772 filed on October 26, 2007 which is hereby incorporated herein<br>
by reference.<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0002]   This disclosure pertains to control systems for electro-mechanical<br>
transmissions.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0003]   The statements in this section merely provide background<br>
information related to the present disclosure and may not constitute prior art.<br>
[0004]    Known powertrain architectures include torque-generative devices,<br>
including internal combustion engines and electric machines, which transmit<br>
torque through a transmission device to an output member. One exemplary<br>
powertrain includes a two-mode, compound-split, electro-mechanical<br>
transmission which utilizes an input member for receiving motive torque from<br>
a prime mover power source, preferably an internal combustion engine, and an<br>
output member. The output member can be operatively connected to a<br>
driveline for a motor vehicle for transmitting tractive torque thereto. Electric<br>
machines, operative as motors or generators, generate a torque input to the<br>
GMC7231<br><br>
transmission, independently of a torque input from the internal combustion<br>
engine. The electric machines may transform vehicle kinetic energy,<br>
transmitted through the vehicle driveline, to electrical energy that is storable in<br>
an electrical energy storage device. A control system monitors various inputs<br>
from the vehicle and the operator and provides operational control of the<br>
powertrain, including controlling transmission operating state and gear<br>
shifting, controlling the torque-generative devices, and regulating the electrical<br>
power interchange among the electrical energy storage device and the electric<br>
machines to manage outputs of the transmission, including torque and<br>
rotational speed.<br>
[0005]   Operation of the above devices within a hybrid drive vehicle require<br>
management of numerous torque bearing shafts or devices representing<br>
connections to the above mentioned engine, electrical motors, and driveline.<br>
Various control schemes and operational connections between the various<br>
aforementioned components of the hybrid drive system are known, and the<br>
control system must be able to engage and disengage the various components<br>
in order to perform the functions of the hybrid drive system. Engagement and<br>
disengagement is known to be accomplished through the use of a transmission<br>
employing clutches. Clutches are devices well known in the art for engaging<br>
and disengaging shafts including the management of rotational velocity and<br>
torque differences between the shafts. Engagement or locking, disengagement<br>
or unlocking, operation while engaged or locked operation, and operation<br>
while disengaged or unlocked operation are all clutch states that must be<br>
managed in order for the vehicle to operate properly and smoothly.<br><br>
[0006]    Implications to vehicle operation related to perceptible jerks or abrupt<br>
changes to vehicle acceleration are collectively described as drivability. One<br>
source of perceptible jerks affecting drivability is slip, or relative rotational<br>
movement between the connective surfaces of a clutch. Slip occurs whenever<br>
the reactive torque transmitted through the clutch exceeds the actual torque<br>
capacity. Clutches can be designed to operate with some level of controlled<br>
slip in asynchronous operation, or clutches can be designed to operate with<br>
little or preferably no slip in synchronous operation. This disclosure deals<br>
with clutches designed primarily for synchronous operation. Slip in a<br>
transmission in synchronous operation results in unintended loss of control<br>
within the transmission and adverse effects upon drivability.<br>
[0007]   Clutches are known in a variety of designs and control methods. One<br>
known type of clutch is a mechanical clutch operating by separating or joining<br>
two connective surfaces, for instance, clutch plates, operating, when joined, to<br>
apply frictional torque to each other. One control method for operating such a<br>
mechanical clutch includes applying a hydraulic control system implementing<br>
fluidic pressures transmitted through hydraulic lines to exert or release<br>
clamping force between the two connective surfaces. In an exemplary<br>
hydraulically actuated clutch, capacity of the clutch to transfer reactive torque<br>
is created by the applied clamping force compressing and creating friction<br>
force between the clutch connective surfaces. Applied clamping force is<br>
reacted by hydraulic pressure acting within an actuation device, such as a<br>
piston driven cylinder, translating pressure through the piston into a force.<br>
Operated thusly, the clutch is not operated in a binary manner, but rather is<br>
capable of a range of engagement states, from fully disengaged and<br><br>
desynchronized, to synchronized with no clamping force applied, to engaged<br>
but with only minimal clamping force, to engaged with some maximum<br>
clamping force. This variable control of clutches allows for smooth transition<br>
between locked and unlocked states and also allows for managing slip in a<br>
locked transmission.<br>
[0008]   The capacity of the clutch to transmit reactive torque is a function of<br>
the magnitude of the clamping force applied to the clutch and the coefficients<br>
of friction between the connective surfaces being applied. Coefficients of<br>
friction between two surfaces are known in the art to include a static<br>
coefficient of friction and a kinetic coefficient of friction. Through the life of<br>
a clutch, wear causes gradual degradation of the clutch torque capacity for a<br>
given clamping force. As a result, a clutch pressure originally sufficient to<br>
create a particular torque capacity within the clutch can eventually fail to<br>
create the same torque capacity.<br>
[0009]   A method to operate a powertrain comprising modulating clutch<br>
clamping force based upon clutch slip would be beneficial to adjust for<br>
degradation in clutch torque capacity.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
[0010]   A method for reducing occurrence of clutch slip in electro-<br>
mechanical transmission adapted to selectively transmit mechanical power to<br>
an output member through selective application of a hydraulically actuated<br>
clutch includes monitoring operation of said clutch, identifying an indication<br>
of clutch wear based upon said monitoring said operation, and increasing a<br><br>
minimum clamping force applied to said clutch based upon said indication of<br>
clutch wear.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0021]   Referring now to the drawings, wherein the showings are for the<br>
purpose of illustrating certain exemplary embodiments only and not for the<br>
purpose of limiting the same, Figs. 1 and 2 depict an exemplary electro-<br>
mechanical hybrid powertrain. The exemplary electro-mechanical hybrid<br>
powertrain in accordance with the present disclosure is depicted in FIG. 1,<br>
comprising a two-mode, compound-split, electro-mechanical hybrid<br>
transmission 10 operatively connected to an engine 14 and first and second<br>
electric machines ('MG-A') 56 and ('MG-B') 72.  The engine 14 and first and<br>
second electric machines 56 and 72 each generate power which can be<br>
transmitted to the transmission 10. The power generated by the engine 14 and<br>
the first and second electric machines 56 and 72 and transmitted to the<br>
transmission 10 is described in terms of input torques, referred to herein as T1,<br>
TA, and TB respectively, and speed, referred to herein as  n1  NA,and NB,<br>
respectively.<br>
[0022]   The exemplary engine 14 comprises a multi-cylinder internal<br>
combustion engine selectively operative in several states to transmit torque to<br>
the transmission 10 via an input shaft 12, and can be either a spark-ignition or<br><br>
a compression-ignition engine. The engine 14 includes a crankshaft (not<br>
shown) operatively coupled to the input shaft 12 of the transmission 10. A<br>
rotational speed sensor 11 monitors rotational speed of the input shaft 12.<br>
Power output from the engine 14, comprising rotational speed and output<br>
torque, can differ from the input speed, N1 and the input torque, T1, to the<br>
transmission 10 due to placement of torque-consuming components on the<br>
input shaft 12 between the engine 14 and the transmission 10, e.g., a hydraulic<br>
pump (not shown) and/or a torque management device (not shown).<br>
[0023]   The exemplary transmission 10 comprises three planetary-gear sets<br>
24,26 and 28, and four selectively engageable torque-transmitting devices,<br>
i.e., clutches Cl 70, C2 62, C3 73, and C4 75. As used herein, clutches refer<br>
to any type of friction torque transfer device including single or compound<br>
plate clutches or packs, band clutches, and brakes, for example. A hydraulic<br>
control circuit 42, preferably controlled by a transmission control module<br>
(hereafter TCM') 17, is operative to control clutch states. Clutches C2 62 and<br>
C4 75 preferably comprise hydraulically-applied rotating friction clutches.<br>
Clutches Cl 70 and C3 73 preferably comprise hydraulically-controlled<br>
stationary devices that can be selectively grounded to a transmission case 68.<br>
Each of the clutches Cl 70, C2 62, C3 73, and C4 75 is preferably<br>
hydraulically applied, selectively receiving pressurized hydraulic fluid via the<br>
hydraulic control circuit 42.<br>
[0024]   The first and second electric machines 56 and 72 preferably comprise<br>
three-phase AC machines, each including a stator (not shown) and a rotor (not<br>
shown), and respective resolvers 80 and 82. The motor stator for each<br>
machine is grounded to an outer portion of the transmission case 68, and<br><br>
includes a stator core with coiled electrical windings extending therefrom.<br>
The rotor for the first electric machine 56 is supported on a hub plate gear that<br>
is operatively attached to shaft 60 via the second planetary gear set 26. The<br>
rotor for the second electric machine 72 is fixedly attached to a sleeve shaft<br>
hub 66.<br>
[0025]   Each of the resolvers 80 and 82 preferably comprises a variable<br>
reluctance device including a resolver stator (not shown) and a resolver rotor<br>
(not shown). The resolvers 80 and 82 are appropriately positioned and<br>
assembled on respective ones of the first and second electric machines 56 and<br>
72. Stators of respective ones of the resolvers 80 and 82 are operatively<br>
connected to one of the stators for the first and second electric machines 56<br>
and 72. The resolver rotors are operatively connected to the rotor for the<br>
corresponding first and second electric machines 56 and 72. Each of the<br>
resolvers 80 and 82 is signally and operatively connected to a transmission<br>
power inverter control module (hereafter 'TPIM') 19, and each senses and<br>
monitors rotational position of the resolver rotor relative to the resolver stator,<br>
thus monitoring rotational position of respective ones of first and second<br>
electric machines 56 and 72. Additionally, the signals output from the<br>
resolvers 80 and 82 are interpreted to provide the rotational speeds for first<br>
and second electric machines 56 and 72, i.e., NAand NB, respectively.<br>
[0026]   The transmission 10 includes an output member 64, e.g. a shaft,<br>
which is operably connected to a driveline 90 for a vehicle (not shown), to<br>
provide output power, e.g., to vehicle wheels 93, one of which is shown in<br>
FIG. 1. The output power is characterized in terms of an output rotational<br>
speed, No and an output torque, To. A transmission output speed sensor 84<br><br>
monitors rotational speed and rotational direction of the output member 64.<br>
Each of the vehicle wheels 93, is preferably equipped with a sensor 94 adapted<br>
to monitor wheel speed, VSS-WHL, the output of which is monitored by a<br>
control module of a distributed control module system described with respect<br>
to FIG. 2, to determine vehicle speed, and absolute and relative wheel speeds<br>
for braking control, traction control, and vehicle acceleration management.<br>
[0027]   The input torques from the engine 14 and the first and second electric<br>
machines 56 and 72 (T1, TA, and TB respectively) are generated as a result of<br>
energy conversion from fuel or electrical potential stored in an electrical<br>
energy storage device (hereafter 'ESD') 74. The ESD 74 is high voltage DC-<br>
coupled to the TPIM 19 via DC transfer conductors 27. The transfer<br>
conductors 27 include a contactor switch 38. When the contactor switch 38 is<br>
closed, under normal operation, electric current can flow between the ESD 74<br>
and the TPIM 19. When the contactor switch 38 is opened electric current<br>
flow between the ESD 74 and the TPIM 19 is interrupted. The TPIM 19<br>
transmits electrical power to and from the first electric machine 56 by transfer<br>
conductors 29, and the TPIM 19 similarly transmits electrical power to and<br>
from the second electric machine 72 by transfer conductors 31, in response to<br>
torque commands for the first and second electric machines 56 and 72 to<br>
achieve the input torques TA and TB. Electrical current is transmitted to and<br>
from the ESD 74 in accordance with whether the ESD 74 is being charged or<br>
discharged.<br>
[0028]   The TPIM 19 includes the pair of power inverters (not shown) and<br>
respective motor control modules (not shown) configured to receive the torque<br>
commands and control inverter states therefrom for providing motor drive or<br><br>
regeneration functionality to achieve the input torques TAand TB. The power<br>
inverters comprise known complementary three-phase power electronics<br>
devices, and each includes a plurality of insulated gate bipolar transistors (not<br>
shown) for converting DC power from the ESD 74 to AC power for powering<br>
respective ones of the first and second electric machines 56 and 72, by<br>
switching at high frequencies. The insulated gate bipolar transistors form a<br>
switch mode power supply configured to receive control commands. There is<br>
typically one pair of insulated gate bipolar transistors for each phase of each of<br>
the three-phase electric machines. States of the insulated gate bipolar<br>
transistors are controlled to provide motor drive mechanical power generation<br>
or electric power regeneration functionality. The three-phase inverters receive<br>
or supply DC electric power via DC transfer conductors 27 and transform it to<br>
or from three-phase AC power, which is conducted to or from the first and<br>
second electric machines 56 and 72 for operation as motors or generators via<br>
transfer conductors 29 and 31 respectively.<br>
[0029]   FIG. 2 is a schematic block diagram of the distributed control module<br>
system. The elements described hereinafter comprise a subset of an overall<br>
vehicle control architecture, and provide coordinated system control of the<br>
exemplary powertrain described in FIG. 1. The distributed control module<br>
system synthesizes pertinent information and inputs, and executes algorithms<br>
to control various actuators to achieve control objectives, including objectives<br>
related to fuel economy, emissions, performance, drivability, and protection of<br>
hardware, including batteries of ESD 74 and the first and second electric<br>
machines 56 and 72. The distributed control module system includes an<br>
engine control module (hereafter 'ECM') 23, the TCM 17, a battery pack<br><br>
control module (hereafter 'BPCM') 21, and the TPIM 19. A hybrid control<br>
module (hereafter 'HCP') 5 provides supervisory control and coordination of<br>
the ECM 23, the TCM 17, the BPCM 21, and the TPIM 19. A user interface<br>
('UP) 13 is operatively connected to a plurality of devices through which a<br>
vehicle operator controls or directs operation of the electro-mechanical hybrid<br>
powertrain. The devices include an accelerator pedal 113 ('AP') from which<br>
an operator torque request is determined, an operator brake pedal 112 ('BP'), a<br>
transmission gear selector 114 ('PRNDL'), and a vehicle speed cruise control<br>
(not shown). The transmission gear selector 114 may have a discrete number<br>
of operator-selectable positions, including the rotational direction of the output<br>
member 64 to enable one of a forward and a reverse direction.<br>
[0030]   The aforementioned control modules communicate with other control<br>
modules, sensors, and actuators via a local area network (hereafter 'LAN') bus<br>
6. The LAN bus 6 allows for structured communication of states of operating<br>
parameters and actuator command signals between the various control<br>
modules. The specific communication protocol utilized is application-specific.<br>
The LAN bus 6 and appropriate protocols provide for robust messaging and<br>
multi-control module interfacing between the aforementioned control<br>
modules, and other control modules providing functionality such as antilock<br>
braking, traction control, and vehicle stability. Multiple communications<br>
buses may be used to improve communications speed and provide some level<br>
of signal redundancy and integrity. Communication between individual<br>
control modules can also be effected using a direct link, e.g., a serial<br>
peripheral interface ('SPP) bus (not shown).<br><br>
[0031]   The HCP 5 provides supervisory control of the powertrain, serving to<br>
coordinate operation of the ECM 23, TCM 17, TPIM 19, and BPCM 21.<br>
Based upon various input signals from the user interface 13 and the<br>
powertrain, including the ESD 74, the HCP 5 generates various commands,<br>
including: the operator torque request ('TOREQ'), a commanded output torque<br>
('TCMD') to the driveline 90, an engine input torque command, clutch torques<br>
for the torque-transfer clutches Cl 70, C2 62, C3 73, C4 75 of the<br>
transmission 10; and the torque commands for the first and second electric<br>
machines 56 and 72, respectively. The TCM 17 is operatively connected to the<br>
hydraulic control circuit 42 and provides various functions including<br>
monitoring various pressure sensing devices (not shown) and generating and<br>
communicating control signals to various solenoids (not shown) thereby<br>
controlling pressure switches and control valves contained within the<br>
hydraulic control circuit 42.<br>
[0032]    The ECM 23 is operatively connected to the engine 14, and functions<br>
to acquire data from sensors and control actuators of the engine 14 over a<br>
plurality of discrete lines, shown for simplicity as an aggregate bi-directional<br>
interface cable 35. The ECM 23 receives the engine input torque command<br>
from the HCP 5. The ECM 23 determines the actual engine input torque, T|,<br>
provided to the transmission 10 at that point in time based upon monitored<br>
engine speed and load, which is communicated to the HCP 5. The ECM 23<br>
monitors input from the rotational speed sensor 11 to determine the engine<br>
input speed to the input shaft 12, which translates to the transmission input<br>
speed, N1. The ECM 23 monitors inputs from sensors (not shown) to<br>
determine states of other engine operating parameters including, e.g., a<br><br>
manifold pressure, engine coolant temperature, ambient air temperature, and<br>
ambient pressure. The engine load can be determined, for example, from the<br>
manifold pressure, or alternatively, from monitoring operator input to the<br>
accelerator pedal 113. The ECM 23 generates and communicates command<br>
signals to control engine actuators, including, e.g., fuel injectors, ignition<br>
modules, and throttle control modules, none of which are shown.<br>
[0033]   The TCM 17 is operatively connected to the transmission 10 and<br>
monitors inputs from sensors (not shown) to determine states of transmission<br>
operating parameters. The TCM 17 generates and communicates command<br>
signals to control the transmission 10, including controlling the hydraulic<br>
control circuit 42. Inputs from the TCM 17 to the HCP 5 include estimated<br>
clutch torques for each of the clutches, i.e., C1 70, C2 62, C3 73, and C4 75,<br>
and rotational output speed, No, of the output member 64. Other actuators and<br>
sensors may be used to provide additional information from the TCM 17 to the<br>
HCP 5 for control purposes. The TCM 17 monitors inputs from pressure<br>
switches (not shown) and selectively actuates pressure control solenoids (not<br>
shown) and shift solenoids (not shown) of the hydraulic circuit 42 to<br>
selectively actuate the various clutches Cl 70, C2 62, C3 73, and C4 75 to<br>
achieve various transmission operating range states, as described hereinbelow.<br>
[0034]   The BPCM 21 is signally connected to sensors (not shown) to<br>
monitor the ESD 74, including states of electrical current and voltage<br>
parameters, to provide information indicative of parametric states of the<br>
batteries of the ESD 74 to the HCP 5. The parametric states of the batteries<br>
preferably include battery state-of-charge, battery voltage, battery temperature,<br>
and available battery power, referred to as a range PBAT_MINto PBAT_MAX-<br><br>
[0035]    Each of the control modules ECM 23, TCM 17, TPIM 19 and BPCM<br>
21 is preferably a general-purpose digital computer comprising a<br>
microprocessor or central processing unit, storage mediums comprising read<br>
only memory ('ROM'), random access memory ('RAM'), electrically<br>
programmable read only memory ('EPROM'), a high speed clock, analog to<br>
digital ('A/D') and digital to analog ('D/A') circuitry, and input/output<br>
circuitry and devices ('I/O') and appropriate signal conditioning and buffer<br>
circuitry. Each of the control modules has a set of control algorithms,<br>
comprising resident program instructions and calibrations stored in one of the<br>
storage mediums and executed to provide the respective functions of each<br>
computer. Information transfer between the control modules is preferably<br>
accomplished using the LAN bus 6 and SPI buses. The control algorithms are<br>
executed during preset loop cycles such that each algorithm is executed at<br>
least once each loop cycle. Algorithms stored in the non-volatile memory<br>
devices are executed by one of the central processing units to monitor inputs<br>
from the sensing devices and execute control and diagnostic routines to<br>
control operation of the actuators, using preset calibrations. Loop cycles are<br>
executed at regular intervals, for example each 3.125, 6.25, 12.5,25 and 100<br>
milliseconds during ongoing operation of the powertrain. Alternatively,<br>
algorithms may be executed in response to the occurrence of an event.<br>
[0036]   The exemplary powertrain selectively operates in one of several<br>
operating range states that can be described in terms of an engine state<br>
comprising one of an engine on state ('ON') and an engine off state ('OFF'),<br>
and a transmission state comprising a plurality of fixed gears and continuously<br>
variable operating modes, described with reference to Table 1, below.<br><br>
Table 1<br><br>

[0037]   Each of the transmission operating range states is described in the<br>
table and indicates which of the specific clutches Cl 70, C2 62, C3 73, and C4<br>
75 are applied for each of the operating range states. A first continuously<br>
variable mode, i.e., EVT Mode I, or Ml, is selected by applying clutch Cl70<br>
only in order to "ground" the outer gear member of the third planetary gear set<br>
28. The engine state can be one of ON ('MI_Eng_On') or OFF<br>
('MIEngOff). A second continuously variable mode, i.e., EVT Mode II, or<br>
Mil, is selected by applying clutch C2 62 only to connect the shaft 60 to the<br>
carrier of the third planetary gear set 28. The engine state can be one of ON<br>
('MII_Eng_On') or OFF ('MII_Eng_Off). For purposes of this description,<br>
when the engine state is OFF, the engine input speed is equal to zero<br>
revolutions per minute ('RPM'), i.e., the engine crankshaft is not rotating.  A<br>
fixed gear operation provides a fixed ratio operation of input-to-output speed<br>
of the transmission 10, i.e., N[/No, is achieved. A first fixed gear operation<br>
('FG1') is selected by applying clutches Cl 70 and C4 75. A second fixed<br><br>
gear operation ('FG2') is selected by applying clutches Cl 70 and C2 62. A<br>
third fixed gear operation ('FG3') is selected by applying clutches C2 62 and<br>
C4 75. A fourth fixed gear operation ('FG4') is selected by applying clutches<br>
C2 62 and C3 73. The fixed ratio operation of input-to-output speed increases<br>
with increased fixed gear operation due to decreased gear ratios in the<br>
planetary gears 24, 26, and 28. The rotational speeds of the first and second<br>
electric machines 56 and 72, NAand NB respectively, are dependent on internal<br>
rotation of the mechanism as defined by the clutching and are proportional to<br>
the input speed measured at the input shaft 12.<br>
[0038]   In response to operator input via the accelerator pedal 113 and brake<br>
pedal 112 as captured by the user interface 13, the HCP 5 and one or more of<br>
the other control modules determine the commanded output torque, TCMD,<br>
intended to meet the operator torque request, TOREQ, to be executed at the<br>
output member 64 and transmitted to the driveline 90. Final vehicle<br>
acceleration is affected by other factors including, e.g., road load, road grade,<br>
and vehicle mass. The operating range state is determined for the transmission<br>
10 based upon a variety of operating characteristics of the powertrain. This<br>
includes the operator torque request, communicated through the accelerator<br>
pedal 113 and brake pedal 112 to the user interface 13 as previously described.<br>
The operating range state may be predicated on a powertrain torque demand<br>
caused by a command to operate the first and second electric machines 56 and<br>
72 in an electrical energy generating mode or in a torque generating mode.<br>
The operating range state can be determined by an optimization algorithm or<br>
routine which determines optimum system efficiency based upon operator<br>
demand for power, battery state of charge, and energy efficiencies of the<br><br>
engine 14 and the first and second electric machines 56 and 72. The control<br>
system manages torque inputs from the engine 14 and the first and second<br>
electric machines 56 and 72 based upon an outcome of the executed<br>
optimization routine, and system efficiencies are optimized thereby, to manage<br>
fuel economy and battery charging. Furthermore, operation can be determined<br>
based upon a fault in a component or system. The HCP 5 monitors the torque-<br>
generative devices, and determines the power output from the transmission 10<br>
required to achieve the desired output torque to meet the operator torque<br>
request. As should be apparent from the description above, the ESD 74 and<br>
the first and second electric machines 56 and 72 are electrically-operatively<br>
coupled for power flow therebetween. Furthermore, the engine 14, the first<br>
and second electric machines 56 and 72, and the electro-mechanical<br>
transmission 10 are mechanically-operatively coupled to transmit power<br>
therebetween to generate a power flow to the output member 64.<br>
[0039]   Clutch torque capacity is a function of the clamping force applied to<br>
the clutch and the relevant coefficient of friction for the connective surfaces of<br>
the clutch. When the clutch connective surfaces are synchronized and locked,<br>
meaning that the connective surfaces are in contact and moving with zero<br>
relative angular velocity, a static coefficient of friction describes the clutch<br>
torque capacity resulting from the clamping force. When the clutch<br>
connective surfaces are not locked and the clutch is slipping, a kinetic<br>
coefficient of friction, lower than the static coefficient of friction, describes<br>
the torque between the connective surfaces resisting the slip. If this torque<br>
resisting the slip is greater than the torque being transmitted through the<br>
clutch, then slip speed will reduce. If the torque resisting the slip is less than<br><br>
the torque being transmitted through the clutch, then the slip speed will<br>
increase. Therefore, a method to recover a locked state in a slipping clutch is<br>
to increase clamping force to increase torque resisting the slip. Many methods<br>
in control logic are envisioned to boost clamping force. One exemplary<br>
method to accomplish this boost is to sum a pressure required to meet a clutch<br>
reactive torque requirement (PCL_REQ) and an offset pressure (POFFSET)<br>
calibrated to control the slip. Methods described herein discuss adjustments to<br>
hydraulic line pressure in terms of adjustments to POFFSET for convenience.<br>
However, it will be appreciated that POFFSET is simply an efficient means to<br>
discuss adjusting a minimum hydraulic line pressure taking clutch reactive<br>
torque into account. In broader terms, the disclosure could equivalently<br>
discuss maintaining a minimum hydraulic line pressure in the context of<br>
adjustments to PCL_REQ instead of increasing POFFSET, but POFFSET, as an<br>
exemplary embodiment, provides a clear illustration of utilization of<br>
incremental increases.<br>
[0040]   FIG. 3 is a graphical representation of an exemplary slip event and<br>
corresponding clutch slip recovery event in accordance with the present<br>
disclosure. Two graphs are depicted sharing a common timescale. The top<br>
portion of the graph depicts slip speed or the relative angular velocity between<br>
connective surfaces of a clutch. Some embodiments of synchronous clutches<br>
can sustain low levels of slip or brief occurrences of slip without significant<br>
degradation to performance or risk of damage. A method is depicted to<br>
classify a significant slip event as an occurrence of slip above some threshold<br>
slip magnitude for more than a threshold duration of time. Slip initially<br>
increases from zero in excess of the threshold slip magnitude. If slip reduces<br><br>
below the threshold quickly, in a time less than the threshold slip duration,<br>
then the slip event can be disregarded as not significant. However, if slip in<br>
excess of the threshold slip magnitude is detected for longer than the threshold<br>
slip duration, then the slip event can be classified as significant, and a slip<br>
remediation action can be initiated. As described above, an increase in<br>
clamping force applied to the clutch connective surfaces increases the torque<br>
within the clutch resisting slip. POFFSETas an exemplary method to control an<br>
increase in clamping force is depicted in the bottom portion of the graph.<br>
[0041]   Hydraulic line pressure is effected by a hydraulic pump. One known<br>
configuration of a powertrain includes a main hydraulic pump mechanically<br>
driven by an engine, wherein engine rotation directly drives the hydraulic<br>
pump and supplies hydraulic pressure to the hydraulic control system. In<br>
hybrid powertrain applications or application utilizing an engine start/stop<br>
strategy, deactivation or idling of the engine can reduce or remove hydraulic<br>
pressure available from the main hydraulic pump. An auxiliary hydraulic<br>
pump is known to be used, utilizing for example an electric motor, to provide<br>
alternative or additional hydraulic pressure. In particular in association with<br>
an auxiliary pump, hydraulic pressure is managed, where the auxiliary pump is<br>
not operated at full capacity when the maximum hydraulic pressure is not<br>
needed. However, in association with a perceived demand for a maximum<br>
available hydraulic line pressure (PMAX) the auxiliary pump can be controlled<br>
to provide additional pressure. Control of the auxiliary hydraulic pump is<br>
known to be accomplished through an auxiliary hydraulic pump control<br>
module processing inputs and issuing auxiliary pump speed commands.<br>
Hydraulic pressure can additionally be managed in relation to a main<br><br>
hydraulic pump or an auxiliary hydraulic pump by managing consumption of<br>
hydraulic flow in functions consuming pressurized hydraulic fluid.<br>
[0042]   Returning to FIG. 3, POFFSET describes an increase to commanded<br>
hydraulic line pressure in order to remediate the detected slip event. Upon<br>
initiation of slip remediation, POFFSET is commanded to PMAX in order to<br>
provide the most rapid and effective means to control slip possible. Once slip<br>
speed is reduced below the threshold slip magnitude, POFFSET can be reduced<br>
below PMAX and restored to a normal level. Restoration of POFFSET can be<br>
accomplished in a step pattern, immediately restoring POFFSET to zero.<br>
However, in order to avoid reoccurrence of slip, a method stepping down<br>
POFFSET incrementally has been shown to be beneficial. The number of<br>
increments, the incremental decreases in POFFSET, and the hold times for each<br>
incremental decrease before the next decrease may be developed<br>
experimentally, empirically, predictively, through modeling or other<br>
techniques adequate to accurately predict clutch and hydraulic control system<br>
operation, and a multitude of POFFSET reduction strategies might be used by the<br>
same powertrain for different clutches and for different conditions or operating<br>
ranges. The threshold slip magnitude and the threshold slip duration as<br>
described in the above method can be a simple value or may be variable<br>
depending upon vehicle conditions. These values can be developed<br>
experimentally, empirically, predictively, through modeling or other<br>
techniques adequate to accurately predict clutch operation.<br>
[0043]   The method described in FIG. 3 remediates significant slip events by<br>
increasing clamping force through a slip event. However, each slip event is<br>
treated in isolation, and no action is taken to account for changing behavior in<br><br>
the clutch. As described above, wear in a clutch tends to increase the<br>
clamping force required to achieve a given clutch torque capacity. FIG. 4 is a<br>
graphical representation of a slip event and a corresponding clutch slip<br>
recovery event, including a method to gradually, incrementally increase<br>
POFFSET in order to adjust clutch torque capacity, in accordance with the<br>
present disclosure. Similarly to FIG. 3, FIG. 4 includes a graph on a top<br>
portion depicting slip speed and, on a common timescale, a graph on a bottom<br>
portion depicting POFFSET as an exemplary method to control a slip remediation<br>
event. As described above, in the event that slip in excess of a threshold slip<br>
magnitude is detected for longer than a threshold slip duration, slip<br>
remediation is initiated, wherein POFFSET is increased to PMAX- Once slip speed<br>
is reduced below the threshold slip magnitude, POFFSET is reduced in<br>
increments as described in FIG. 3. However, instead of returning to the initial<br>
POFFSET level, zero in the exemplary data, POFFSET is reduced to some increased<br>
minimum POFFSET. This increased POFFSET creates an incrementally increased<br>
clamping force upon the clutch. By increasing the clamping force upon the<br>
clutch, the clutch can exert an increased clutch torque capacity than was<br>
exerted before the minimum POFFSET was increased. This incremental increase<br>
in clutch torque capacity in response to a slip event serves to offset gradual<br>
degradation in the clutch.<br>
[0044]   Other methods to increase POFFSET or otherwise increase applied force<br>
to a clutch are envisioned. For example, a look-up table or a time or usage<br>
based clutch wear estimate function can be utilized to gradually implement an<br>
increased clamping force to compensate for clutch wear. However, lookup<br>
tables and functional estimates are prone to error. Such error can lead to<br><br>
unnecessarily high hydraulic line pressures, creating inefficient requirements<br>
upon the auxiliary hydraulic pump. An adjustment to clamping force based<br>
upon a feedback signal such as a slip event indication provides for necessary<br>
increases to clamping force based upon an indication that clutch torque<br>
capacity has been reduced below expected levels for a given clamping force.<br>
Other methods to control increases to clamping force envisioned include<br>
applying statistical analysis to a set of slip events in order to evaluate and<br>
predict a clutch wear rate. Such a predicted clutch wear rate, if determined to<br>
meet some minimum level of confidence, can be used to anticipatorily<br>
increase clamping force through the life of the clutch. Additionally, it will be<br>
appreciated by one having ordinary skill in the art that clutch slip in the above<br>
described method is being used as a means to evaluate wear on the clutch.<br>
Any method to evaluate wear on the clutch, for example, running the clutch in<br>
a test mode upon vehicle start-up, with an asynchronous spin, touching<br>
connective surfaces clutch state evaluation of the clutch, a clutch wear health<br>
estimate could be used in place of the significant clutch slip event indicated<br>
above. The disclosure envisions many methods to evaluate wear upon the<br>
clutch and is not intended to be limited to the specific exemplary embodiments<br>
described herein.<br>
[0045]   FIG. 5 graphically depicts incremental increases to minimum POFFSET<br>
over a number of slip events, in accordance with the present disclosure.<br>
POFFSET is depicted through a number of slip events, each slip event initiating a<br>
corresponding slip remediation. With each remediation, as described above,<br>
POFFSET returns to an incrementally increased minimum value. The magnitude<br>
of each incremental increase in minimum POFFSET can be a set increment, can<br><br>
be based upon a logarithmic or scaled function, or the magnitude can change<br>
according to some monitored variable such as the magnitude of the subject slip<br>
event or the maintenance status of the clutch.<br>
[0046]   FIG. 6 graphically illustrates a series of incremental increases in<br>
minimum POFFSET over a number of slip events and corresponding exemplary<br>
clutch torque capacity data, in accordance with the present disclosure.<br>
Minimum POFFSET depicts increases to a minimum POFFSET term as described<br>
above. Clutch torque capacity results from a line pressure applying a<br>
clamping force to clutch connective surfaces, as described above. Without<br>
factoring resulting clutch torque capacity for wear, clutch torque capacity can<br>
be expressed as a function of line pressure applied to the clutch. In order to<br>
account for wear, a modification to the function relating clutch pressure to<br>
clutch torque capacity can be programmed, including a modulation factor such<br>
as POFFSET to account for the effects of wear. However, retaining the<br>
calculation of clutch torque capacity as a simple equation based upon line<br>
pressure applied to the clutch is beneficial due to resulting simplified<br>
calculations. Clutch torque capacity is used in many modules and calculations<br>
throughout the powertrain, and simplified calculation of clutch torque capacity<br>
benefits each of these downstream uses. A preferred method is disclosed<br>
wherein line pressure to the clutch is modulated by the POFFSET term, and<br>
clutch torque capacity calculations assume zero wear upon the clutch<br>
connective surfaces. In FIG. 6, a reference clutch torque capacity is depicted,<br>
demonstrating a clutch torque capacity that can be estimated for a given line<br>
pressure applied to a clutch. An unmodified clutch torque capacity is depicted<br>
illustrating exemplary behavior of a clutch for the given line pressure and<br><br>
experiencing normal wear through the life of the clutch wherein no increase to<br>
minimum POFFSET is utilized. As described above, wear gradually reduces<br>
clutch torque capacity resulting from application of a particular clamping force<br>
resulting from the line pressure. Because, in the exemplary data, no offset is<br>
utilized to increase clamping force, the unmodified clutch torque capacity for a<br>
given reactive torque input decreases over time. An incrementally increased<br>
clutch torque capacity is depicted, illustrating periodic increases to clutch<br>
torque capacity for a given reactive torque input, corresponding to increases in<br>
POFFSET- While wear continues to degrade the ability of the clutch to transmit<br>
reactive torque through the life of the clutch, as depicted by the general<br>
downward trend in the data, increases to POFFSET sustains clutch torque<br>
capacity for a given input.<br>
[0047]   The method above describes a remediation response to a slip event,<br>
including a boost of POFFSET to a PMAX and then a gradual reduction in POFFSET<br>
to an increase minimum POFFSET after the slip event has been contained.<br>
However, selection of the incremental increase in minimum POFFSET.<br>
depending upon how small the increment is, can fail to resist slip proximately<br>
in time to the remediation event. FIG. 7 is a graphical representation of a slip<br>
event and a corresponding clutch slip recovery event, including a method to<br>
set POFFSET in response to a reoccurrence of slip, in accordance with the present<br>
disclosure. As described above, a significant slip event is detected and a<br>
remediation event is initiated. After the slip event is initially contained,<br>
POFFSET is reduced in increments toward a predetermined incrementally<br>
increased minimum POFFSET expected to subsequently deter slip in the<br>
foreseeable future. However, before the new POFFSET is reached in accordance<br><br>
with the expected increase, slip in excess of the threshold slip magnitude<br>
occurs. A number of reactions, comprising a slip reoccurrence recovery cycle,<br>
are contemplated in response to reoccurrence of slip. One exemplary method<br>
is to return POFFSET immediately to PMAX and treat the new slip as a new slip<br>
event. In another exemplary method to react to the reoccurrence of slip,<br>
POFFSET at the level where slip occurred is boosted by a recovery POFFSET<br>
increase. Slip is monitored through a threshold recovery duration to evaluate<br>
whether the recovery POFFSET increase is effective to contain the second slip<br>
event. Two curves are depicted in FIG. 7, one wherein the second slip event is<br>
contained and another wherein the second slip event is not contained in the<br>
threshold recovery duration. In a case wherein after the threshold recovery<br>
duration, slip is reduced to or below the threshold slip magnitude, the recovery<br>
POFFSET increase can be determined to have remediated the second slip event.<br>
In this case, the new minimum POFFSET can be set to the level set by the<br>
recovery POFFSET increase. In a case wherein after the threshold recovery<br>
duration, slip is not reduced to or below the threshold slip magnitude, the<br>
recovery POFFSET increase can be determined to have not remediated the<br>
second slip event. In this case, the second slip event can be treated as a new<br>
case, POFFSET can be increased to PMAX, and methods described herein, such as<br>
the method described in relation to FIG. 4, can be employed to remediate the<br>
slip event. A new POFFSET term can subsequently be selected in excess of the<br>
level indicated by the recovery POFFSET increase that failed to recover the<br>
second slip event.<br>
[0048]   FIG. 8 schematically illustrates an exemplary process to calculate and<br>
combine clutch pressure requirements, incorporating a pressure required to<br><br>
meet clutch reactive torque requirements and POFFSET, in accordance with the<br>
present disclosure. Process 300 comprises clutch reactive torque pressure<br>
module 310, offset pressure module 320, and summation block 330. As<br>
described above, powertrain control mechanisms, am HCP for example,<br>
determine how much torque is to be applied to each clutch in the powertrain.<br>
Clutch reactive torque pressure module 310 inputs requested clutch reactive<br>
torque and applies programming, including factors based upon clutch<br>
specifications, to determine clutch pressure required to achieve a clutch torque<br>
capacity capable of transmitting the requested clutch reactive torque. Clutch<br>
reactive torque pressure module 310 outputs PCL_REQ- Offset pressure module<br>
320 inputs clutch slip data in accordance with methods disclosed herein and<br>
outputs POFFSET- Summation block 330 sums PCL_REQ and POFFSET and outputs<br>
a minimum effective pressure (PMIN_EFF) required to satisfy the required clutch<br>
torque capacity to transmit the request clutch reactive torque and compensate<br>
the clutch torque capacity for clutch capacity due to clutch degradation.<br>
[0049]   FIG. 9 depicts an exemplary process flow, wherein a pressure offset<br>
term is managed in a cycle, in accordance with the present disclosure.<br>
Exemplary process 400 starts at step 410 and proceeds initially to an adapted<br>
state at step 420. The process waits at step 420 until a significant slip event is<br>
detected. Upon detection of a significant slip event, the process proceeds to<br>
step 430 wherein POFFSET is stepped up to PMAX in accordance with methods<br>
described herein in order to contain the slip event. At step 440, after the slip<br>
event has been contained, the process adapts POFFSET through a series of wait<br>
and step down actions, gradually decreasing POFFSET- If no reoccurrence of<br>
slip is detected through step 440, then in step 450 a new minimum PQFFSCT is<br><br>
defined based on methods described herein, and the process reiterates to step<br>
420. If a reoccurrence of slip is detected in step 440, then the process<br>
reiterates to step 430, wherein POFFSET is increased to PMAX and the<br>
containment process is restarted.<br>
[0050]   It is understood that modifications are allowable within the scope of<br>
the disclosure. The disclosure has been described with specific reference to<br>
the preferred embodiments and modifications thereto. Further modifications<br>
and alterations may occur to others upon reading and understanding the<br>
specification. It is intended to include all such modifications and alterations<br>
insofar as they come within the scope of the disclosure.<br><br>

a modulation of a hydraulic line pressure comprising an increased<br>
minimum hydraulic line pressure based upon said indication of<br>
said significant clutch slip event.<br>
17.   The apparatus of claim 16, wherein modulation of said line pressure<br>
further comprises:<br>
a boost in said hydraulic line pressure to a maximum line pressure; and<br>
after said clutch slip is significantly reduced, a reduction of said<br>
hydraulic line pressure in stepped increments to said increased<br>
minimum hydraulic line pressure.<br><br>
A method for reducing occurrence of clutch slip in electro-mechanical transmission adapted to selectively transmit mechanical power to an output member through selective application of a hydraulically actuated clutch includes monitoring operation of said clutch, identifying an indication of clutch wear based upon said monitoring said operation, and increasing a<br>
minimum clamping force applied to said clutch based upon said indication of clutch wear.</td>
