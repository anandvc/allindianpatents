				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to methods and compositions including quaternary ammonium compounds<br>
which provide high levels of disinfection<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
A "high level disinfectant" is a chemical that can be expected to destroy all micro-organisms, with<br>
the exception of high numbers of bacterial spores.<br>
Standards have been established for "sterilization", and for "low", "intermediate" and "high" level<br>
disinfection. These standards are based on the known or possible risk of contamination of a<br>
particular medical device by a particular micro-organism, the pathogenic nature of the organism<br>
and other principles in infection control. The standards typically require demonstration of<br>
sterilization and/or disinfection efficacy against a particular panel of test organisms, which<br>
collectively represent the known or possible infection and contamination risks. The test panels<br>
and criteria are different for "low", "intermediate" or "high-level disinfection". These terms are<br>
herein used in accordance with current Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") criteria for levels<br>
of disinfection which are detailed in Premarket Notification [510(k)] Submissions for Liquid<br>
Chemical Sterilants and High Level Disinfectants FDA 1997: "A germicide that inactivates all<br>
microbial pathogens except large number of bacterial endospores when used according to<br>
labelling". In brief, the FDA regulatory requirement for high level disinfectants includes as the<br>
most challenging test a 100% kill of Mycobacterium tuberculosis var. bovis (or a specific strain of<br>
a suitable surrogate, such as Mycobacterium terrae) in 400 p.p.m. hard water in the presence of<br>
2% horse serum in a quantitative tuberculocidal test.<br>
Mycobacterium tuberculosis var. bovis is an organism which is refractory to treatment by most<br>
bactericidal compounds. In addition, the FDA requirements for high-level disinfectants include<br>
efficacy against specific gram- negative and gram-positive bacteria, fungi and viruses. The<br>
relevant AOAC sporicidal, tuberculocidal, virucidal and bactericidal tests are referenced in<br>
annexure 1 hereto. An additional FDA regulatory requirement for high level disinfectants is that<br>
they must also achieve sterilization although a longer exposure time than the disinfection regimen<br>
time is permissible. Sterilization is tested with a sporicidal activity test utilizing spores of Bacillus<br>
or Clostridium species. It has been demonstrated that the micro-organisms most resistant to<br>
chemical sterilants are the spores of Bacillus species B. subtilis. and C. sporogens. Sterilization<br>
is a process that completely eliminates or destroys all forms of microbial life, including fungal and<br><br>
bacterial spores. To be used as a high level disinfectant, a chemical must be registered as such<br>
with appropriate regulatory authorities such as the FDA (in the USA) or TGA (in Australia).<br>
It is known that a high-level disinfectant ("HLD") will meet the disinfection efficacy standards of<br>
intermediate and low-level disinfection as well. It is universally accepted that low-level<br>
disinfection performance cannot predict intermediate or high-level disinfection performance. In<br>
fact, it is assumed prior to testing that a low-level disinfectant cannot achieve a higher level<br>
disinfection standard.<br>
High level disinfectants are used extensively in the healthcare and medical industry, for example<br>
to disinfect endoscopes, kidney dialyzers and other medical instruments and devices, especially<br>
those liable to be damaged by heat. They are also extensively used by medical offices and<br>
dentists where many of the instruments incorporate rubbers or plastics in their construction and<br>
cannot be heated repeatedly to above 60 °C without damage.<br>
Common commercially available high-level disinfectants include glutaraldehyde solutions<br>
between 0.3 and 3.4%, which typically require activation with an alkaline buffer just prior to use.<br>
Also available are an acidic (pH 1.6-2.0) 7.5%. sup.w/v hydrogen peroxide solution (Sporox®,<br>
Reckitt and Colman, Inc.) and an acidic (pH 1.87) mixture of 1.0% hydrogen peroxide plus 0.08%<br>
peracetic acid ("PAA") (Peract™ 20, Minntech Corp. or Cidex OPA®, Johnson &amp; Johnson). The<br>
minimum effective concentration of PAA for high-level disinfection at 25 minutes (min) and 20°C is<br>
0.05% (500 ppm) (Peract™). The minimum effective concentration of peroxide for high-level<br>
disinfection at 30 min and 20°C is 6.0% (Sporox®).<br>
To be acceptable as a high level disinfectant a composition, in addition to meeting regulatory<br>
standards of microbiological efficacy, must be compatible with construction materials used in<br>
medical instruments such as rubber, plastics, elastomers and metals, and should be easy to use.<br>
It is clearly advantageous if the disinfectant has a low order of toxicity and is readily rinseable with<br>
water. It should be capable of a simple monitoring and validation procedure. It should have a<br>
commercially adequate shelf life and shelf stability. Desirably also it would be economical to<br>
manufacture, and achieve high level disinfection in a relatively short time.<br>
No known high level disinfectant meets all of these desiderata. Gluteraldehyde, peracetic acid,<br>
and phenols are both obnoxious and toxic. In addition residues of some aldehydes on<br>
instruments have been shown to disadvantageously react with biopsy samples and even cause<br>
chemically induced anaphylactic shock to patients undergoing endoscopy. Hydrogen peroxide<br><br>
residues have been shown to interfere with cytoscopy samples taken via a disinfected<br>
cystoscope, and with biopsy samples taken via an endoscope. Even the most benign high level<br>
disinfectants have tended to cause skin irritation or allergenic reaction while others are regarded<br>
as potential carcinogens.<br>
Quaternary ammonium compounds ("quats") have been widely used for industrial and domestic<br>
disinfection for many years and are safe and simple to use. Regrettably, although formulations<br>
containing quats are known to be effective against gram positive organisms such as<br>
streptococcus and staphylococcus, they are among the least effective disinfectants when used<br>
alone. Quats are relatively ineffective against gram negative organisms, are notorious for their<br>
lack of sporicidal effect, and have been widely reported to have virtually no tuberculocidal activity<br>
( see eg "Disinfection, Sterilization, and Preservation", Seymour S. Block, Fifth edition, page<br>
306). Quats are typically used at concentrations ranging from p.p.m. to 0.25% w/w.<br>
Many workers have screened differently substituted quaternary ammonium compounds, and/or<br>
sought coadjuvents, which might raise their effectiveness to a higher disinfection level.<br>
For example US 6,245,361 discloses a combination of 600 - 800 p.p.m. of a quaternary<br>
compound with a chlorine containing compound such as a hypochlorite or diisocyanate in which<br>
the chlorine compound provides the tuberculocidal activity. Chlorine compounds are excellent<br>
sterilants themselves (at the levels specified in the patent) and it seems that the addition of a quat<br>
yields no improvement in Sporicidal/tuberculocidal efficacy when compared to chlorine alone.<br>
The improvement claimed is that the combination with the quaternary ammonium compound is<br>
said to be "less " toxic and "less" skin irritating than is the chlorine compound alone. However,<br>
the presence of the chlorine compound would render the composition corrosive to many<br>
construction materials and the combination shares most of the disadvantages of prior art.<br>
Disinfectants which contain combinations of active components such as in this example are also<br>
disadvantageous with respect to the regulatory process. In some territories although each of the<br>
active ingredients may be well known separately with respect to toxicology and materials<br>
compatibility, the combination must be treated as a new, previously unknown entity for regulatory<br>
purposes.<br>
US 5,444,094 acknowledges that quaternary ammonium salt formulations have long been used<br>
as disinfectants but do not display any tuberculocidal activity. Nor do glycol ethers. However, US<br>
5,444,094 teaches that a combination of a quat at 0.1% to 0.2% w/w with at least about 8% w/w/<br>
glycol ether is tuberculocidal, while combinations with 6% glycol ether are not. This is surprising,<br><br>
and is attributed to disruption of the mycobacteria trilaminar cell wall which is composed of 60%<br>
lipid, by the glycol ether.<br>
Glycol ethers are strong solvents and at these high levels are not compatible with vast majority of<br>
plastics and rubbers used as materials of construction. Another disadvantage of the US<br>
5,444,094 composition is that the product does not exhibit sporicidal properties (as per AOAC<br>
Official Methods of Analysis (1955) sporicidal test, ref No 966.04) and therefore is not a high level<br>
disinfectant ("HLD").<br>
It has been suggested to use disinfectants with ultrasound to kill vegetative spores.<br>
Benzethonium chloride at a concentration of 0.25% and at temperatures above 60°C has been<br>
proposed for that use . However as shown herein such treatment is not effective against<br>
Mycobacterium and the treatment is not suitable for high level disinfection.<br>
It is current medical device user practice for semi critical medical devices (i.e., those that contact<br>
intact skin and mucous membranes such as endoscopes, dental instruments and the like) to use<br>
separate short cleaning and disinfecting steps and times, and reusable solutions. Longer soak<br>
cleaning or disinfecting times and single-use solutions would for the most part be uneconomical<br>
and impractical in current medical or dental practice.<br>
Any discussion of the prior art throughout the specification should in no way be considered as an<br>
admission that such prior art is widely known or forms part of common general knowledge in the<br>
field.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a high level disinfectant which avoids or<br>
ameliorates at least some disadvantages of the prior art. It is an object of preferred embodiments<br>
of the invention to provide a high level disinfectant which is shelf stable, effective in a short time,<br>
and which poses a significantly reduced occupational health threat.<br>
Preferred embodiments of the invention result in a regulated log 6 reduction in population of<br>
Mycobacterium terrae within a time period of 2-10 min in AOAC tuberculocidal tests and both B.<br>
subtilis and Clostridium sporogenes spores in under 5 hours as per FDA requirements for high-<br>
level disinfection (as defined in Premarket Notification [510(k)] Submissions for Liquid Chemical<br>
Sterilants and High Level Disinfectants, FDA 1993).<br>
BRIEF STATEMENT OF THE INVENTION:<br><br>
According to a first aspect the invention provides a method of high level disinfection (as herein<br>
defined) of a surface including the step of treating the surface with a composition including a<br>
quaternary ammonium compound and wherein the concentration of said quaternary ammonium<br>
compound is selected to exceed 1.0% w/w and the temperature of treatment is selected to be in<br>
the range of from 30°C to 80°C, whereby to achieve log 6 reduction in mycobacterium<br>
tuberculosis, if any on the surface, in less than 10 minutes.<br>
In preferred embodiments of the invention, the concentration of quaternary ammonium compound<br>
("quat") exceeds 2% w/w and preferably greater than 4% w/w. The temperature must be raised to<br>
greater than 30°C, preferably to greater than 40°C, and more preferably greater than about 50°C.<br>
However the temperature desirably does not exceed about 60°C in view of the risk of damage to<br>
instruments, although with heat resistant materials may be up to 80°C. Preferred selected<br>
concentrations and temperatures achieve a log 6 reduction in Mycobacterium terrae in less than<br>
5 minutes.<br>
Those skilled in the art will recognize that quats have hitherto been reported to be incapable of<br>
providing high level disinfection. Block (cited supra), a recognized manual in the art of<br>
disinfection, says of quats "they are not tuberculocidal or sporocidal or virucidal against<br>
hydrophilic viruses at high concentration levels". When used as a low level "germicide" quats are<br>
typically applied to surfaces at ambient temperatures and at concentrations of from about 0.1%<br>
up to about 0.25%. There is no suggestion in the prior literature that a quat is capable of killing<br>
mycobacterium tuberculosis at any concentration at room temperature, or that increasing<br>
temperatures above 30°C would have any beneficial effect on a quat's biocidal effectiveness.<br>
Indeed the present inventors have found that at ambient temperature and at concentrations of up<br>
to 1% w/w quats are not capable of high level disinfection, and even at below 2% w/w they do not<br>
achieve that level in a practically short time span. It was therefore surprising to discover that a<br>
high level disinfection could be achieved in a practically short time by utilizing a quat and by<br>
selecting an appropriate concentration and treatment conditions.<br>
The selected temperature of from 30°C to 80°C may be produced by heat or by another physical<br>
chaotrope. For example the increase in temperature may be the result of application of heat<br>
(which is a chaotrope), or application of a physical chaotropic agent such as electromagnetic<br>
radiations (for example ultrasound, microwave, UV, IR or other radiations), electric or magnetic<br>
fields, or even shaking or stirring. Other methods of applying energy include electromagnetic<br>
radiation or energetic vibration from mechanical means such as magnetic or vortex stirring.<br><br>
Energy may be input from electron beam irradiation, iaser, electrolysis, or high energy jets.<br>
Selecting a combination of such chaotropic influences may advantageously be utilized. The<br>
temperature increase may also be produced by other means, for example, exothermic chemical<br>
reaction.<br>
According to a second aspect the invention provides a method according to the first aspect<br>
wherein the composition further includes a chemical chaotrope. A preferred chaotrope is boron<br>
or a boron compound or complex. Desirably the composition also includes a sequestering agent<br>
such as, for example, EDTA.<br>
A chaotropic agent is a physical or chemical interaction with the mixture of quat and<br>
microorganisms that tends to increase the solubility of hydrophobic particles in aqueous solutions,<br>
or which tends to destabilize aggregations of nonpolar solute particles and micelles, or denatures<br>
(folds or unfolds) proteins. Physical chaotropes for use in the invention have been discussed<br>
above. Certain chemical chaotropes, such as metal ions, organic and inorganic anions, urea, etc<br>
may be used alone with the quat or in combination with a physical chaotrope. For preference a<br>
combination of chaotropic agents are employed.<br>
According to a third aspect the invention provides a method according to the first or second<br>
aspect wherein the composition further includes an enzyme.<br>
According to a fourth aspect the invention includes a composition for use in a method of high<br>
level disinfection (as herein defined) according to any one of the preceding aspects, and including<br>
in excess of 1% of a quaternary ammonium compound at 30°C at a working concentration.<br>
It will be understood that the requirements for achieving high level disinfection imply that the<br>
method must be able to meet other requirements defined by the FDA in addition to achievement<br>
of log 6 reduction in Mycobacterium tuberculosis var. bovis. Preferred methods according to the<br>
invention can also achieve a log 6 reduction in both B. subtilis and Clostridium Sporogenes<br>
spores in less than 5 hours in accordance with the appropriate FDA test methods (which specifies<br>
less than 24 hours).<br>
According to a fifth aspect the invention provides a high level disinfectant comprising a quaternary<br>
ammonium compound in a concentration greater than 1% at a working strength and in<br>
combination with one or more chemicals which is a chaotropic agent but is not a spore opening<br>
chemical.<br><br>
Unless the context clearly requires otherwise, throughout the description and the claims, the<br>
words 'comprise', 'comprising', and the like are to be construed in an inclusive sense as opposed<br>
to an exclusive or exhaustive sense; that is to say, in the sense of "including, but not limited to".<br>
PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION.<br>
The invention will now be more particularly described by way of example only.<br>
The invention employs a quaternary ammonium compound under selected conditions to achieve<br>
high level disinfection. Any commercially available quaternary compounds are suitable in the<br>
present invention.<br>
A quaternary ammonium compound can be represented by the general formula (R1 R2 R3 R4<br>
N+)X". R1, R2, R3 and R4 can independently be any suitable substituted or unsubstituted linear or<br>
cyclic groups such as alkyl, aryl, alkaryl, aralkyl, ether and the like.<br>
Preferably, in the present invention R1 and R2 and are independently chosen from the group<br>
consisting of alkyl groups having 1 to 3 carbon atoms, R3 is chosen from the group consisting of<br>
alkyl groups having 8 to 20 carbon atoms, and R4 is chosen from the group consisting of alkyl<br>
groups having 8 to 20 carbon atoms, aryl groups and aryl-substituted alkyl groups where said<br>
substituted alkyl groups have 1-3 carbon atoms and X" is chosen so as to render said quaternary<br>
ammonium compound water-soluble. Any suitable quaternary compound may be used but, for<br>
preference, the quaternary compound used in the invention is a dialkyl quaternary compound and<br>
more preferably is a quaternary compound in which one of the alkyls has a chain length of less<br>
than 18. Desirably at least one of the alkyls is a C14 - C18 alkyl with C12 highly preferred. The<br>
quat may have more than one alkyl chain, or may be an aryl quat. The quat may be, for example,<br>
CHG.<br>
Counterion X- may be any suitable counterion, inorganic or organic. Suitable examples of X.<br>
may include, but are not limited to halide (fluoride, chloride, bromide or iodide), hydroxide,<br>
tetrafluoroborate, phosphate, or carbonate.<br>
The term quat as used herein also encompasses mixtures of quaternary ammonium compounds.<br>
In preferred forms of the invention the selected conditions include application of a combination of<br>
chaotropic agents. For example, a quat at 4% w/w is used in combination with a boron<br><br>
compound together with heat or heat and ultrasound, at say 50°C. Or to use another example, a<br>
quat at 5% w/w may be used with a surfactant and /or a suitable solvent, together with an input of<br>
energy such as to increase temperature to 40°C. It is unclear whether the input of energy, such<br>
as from heating, assists in driving the folding/unfolding equilibrium in favour of unfolding the spore<br>
coat and Mycobacterium cell membrane proteins/lipoproteins, or whether it merely assists in<br>
providing momentary access of quat molecules to otherwise "inaccessible" parts of the spore<br>
surface, or overcomes inherent to quats inactivation by proteinaceous matter or whether it is<br>
effective in activating the quat or targeted microorganisms in some other manner. In highly<br>
preferred forms of the invention a quat is used together with a protease in the presence of borax<br>
and at elevated temperature.<br>
The selected conditions include energy input to increase the temperature from 30°C to 80°C,<br>
preferably above 40°C and below 60°C. Temperatures above 60°C are not desirable because of<br>
the detrimental effect of temperature on construction materials of thermosensitive medical<br>
instruments. The temperature may be elevated by application of heat, but energy input may be<br>
by means of application of ultrasonic energy, infrared or microwave radiation, high pressure, the<br>
action of electric and /or magnetic fields, and even shaking or stirring all of which may be<br>
influential in promoting unfolding (refolding).<br>
Chemical chaotropes which may be combined with the quat include:<br>
(1)	Selected organic solvents of a kind which tend to denature, dissolve or swell proteins.<br>
Generally the products are not completely unfolded and possess an ordered conformation which<br>
differs from the native state. Solvents which favour helical conformations (i.e. unfolding) are<br>
exemplified by N-dimethylformamide, formamide, m-cresol, dioxan, CHCI3, pyridine,<br>
dichlorethylene, and 2-chloroethanol. This group also includes solvents which have a weak<br>
tendency to form hydrogen bonds such as the alcohols, ethanol, n-propanol, methanol (especially<br>
in mixture with 0.01 %HCI), Also, solvents which tend to disorganize the structure e.g.<br>
dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) at high concentrations, dichloroacetic acid and trifluoroacetic acid, and<br>
other electrophilic solvents. It should be noted that the vast majority of these compounds<br>
actually strengthen the spore coat as opposed to acting as a spore-opener.<br>
(2)	Certain organic solutes and chaotropic agents, such as urea or guanidine hydrochloride<br>
(GuHCI). The transition to randomly coiled polypeptide is complete for 6-8M GuHCI at room temp<br>
except for some exceptionally stable proteins. These agents may be markedly influenced by<br>
temperature, pH other reagents and conditions.<br><br>
Inorganic salts can induce conformational transitions in proteins. For example LiBr, CaCI2, KSCN,<br>
Nal, NaBr, borax, sodium azide are strong denaturants. Although these salts do not necessarily<br>
lead to completely unfolded protein, the residual ordered structure may be disrupted by energy<br>
input e.g. increasing temperature. Anions such as CNS"&gt; I- &gt; Br- &gt; NO3- &gt; CI" &gt;CH3COO" &gt; SO42-<br>
exhibit similar behaviour as do guanidinium salts and tetraalkyl ammonium salts However<br>
(GuH)2SO4 has been observed to protect certain proteins against denaturation. Boron may be<br>
used in the form of a compound or complex.<br>
Adsorption on certain surfaces and interfaces including zeolites, including air/liquid interfaces.<br>
(3) Enzymes, for example proteases, amylase, lipidases, cellulases and the like.<br>
EXAMPLES OF THE INVENTION<br>
In the following tables unless otherwise specified references to "kill time" mean the time required<br>
to achieve complete kill as defined in the relevant AOAC test (more particularly identified in<br>
annexure 1). "No kill" means less than 2 log reduction from the initial population. Unless<br>
otherwise specified "QUAT" is benzalkonium chloride, specifically Gardiquat NC-50 (Albright &amp;<br>
Wilson). Test points for vegetative bacteria (M. terrae) were 2, 5,10, 20 and 60 mins. Test points<br>
for spores were 0.5,1,2,4,16,24,48 hours. The last column in each table indicates whether the<br>
tested combination satisfies the FDA requirement for high level disinfection ("HLD") or fails to do<br>
so ("F").<br><br><br><br>
Table 1 shows examples of the use of quats according to prior art in which concentrations in the<br>
range Of .025% to 0.25% are employed at ambient temperature. It can be seen that at up to<br>
0.25% (which is considered a high concentration for formulation of quats) the "kill time" of<br>
Mycobacterium is greater than an hour at 25°C, and for B.subtilis and C.sporogenes kill time is<br>
greater than 24hrs. As test 1.3 shows, the result is the same at 62°C, even in the presence of<br>
ultrasound. None of the examples in Table 1 could be considered useful for High Level<br>
Disinfection.<br><br>
Astonishingly, in contrast to the examples of Table 1, at above 1% w/w of quat and at 40°C, a kill<br>
time of Mycobacterium terrae of less than 5 mins can be achieved, and of B. subtilis and C.<br><br>
sporogenes of less than 2 hours, reducing to less than one hour at 5% and 50°C or 1% at 80°C.<br>
All the table 2 examples give high level disinfection.<br>
The present inventor showed that increasing the temperature from 25°C up to 60°C had no<br>
beneficial effect on a Quats ability to kill Mycobacterium terrae at the prior art concentrations of<br>
0.25% w/w. (table 3 tests 3.1-3.3), with or without ultrasound,<br><br>
Likewise, tests 3.5 - 3.9 show that increasing concentration from 0.25% (1 in 400) to 5.0% (1 in<br>
20) which is about an twenty fold increase above the concentrations used in the prior art had no<br>
significant effect at 25°C .<br>
The present inventors were thus surprised to discover that at about 50°C and at a concentration<br>
of above 0.6%, the kill time of Mycobacterium terrae fell suddenly and sharply to between 20<br>
and 60 minutes, and of B. subtilis and C. sporogenes to less than 16 hours. These times are<br>
not sufficient for practical high level disinfection. For practical high level disinfection a<br>
combination of a concentration greater than 1% and an increase in temperature above room<br><br><br><br><br>
Comparison of tests 5.2 with tests 2.2 &amp; 2.3 shows the beneficial effect of ultrasound in<br>
combination with heat, while tests 5.5 - 5.7 show the combined effect of chemical and physical<br>
chaotropes. The combination of examples 5.5 - 5.7 reduce kill time to less than two minutes for<br>
M. terrae. Experiment 5.7 shows that the result is obtainable in the presence of protease.<br>
Column 2 of table 6 shows a concentration of Quat combined with 0.2% of protease, while<br>
column 3 shows the temperature, borax concentration ( if any), and presence or absence of<br>
ultrasound. Again it can be seen that at 25°C neither protease, borax, nor ultrasound have a<br>
significant benefit even at up to 2% quat concentration, but that at higher temperatures a<br>
surprising and dramatic change in kill time occurs at 2%.<br><br><br><br>

(Quat 2) is Dioctyl Dimethyl Ammonium Chloride -twin chain quat (Bardac LF-80 from Lonza),<br>
(Quat 3) is Barquat MB-50 (N-Alkyl Dimethyl Ammonium Chloride, C14 - 50%, C12 -40%, C16 -<br>

As will be apparent to those skilled in the art from the teaching hereof, quats other than those<br>
exemplified may be used, or quats may be combined for the purposes of the invention. In<br>
preferred embodiments the quat will be formulated with one or more chaotropes for example<br>
boron or a boron compound, enzymes and or surfactants and within the selected range of<br>
concentrations or may be formulated as a concentrate intended to be diluted so as to have a<br>
concentration of the magnitude selected at the working dilution. While increasing the temperature<br>
has a straight forward chaotropic effect, use of microwave, ultrasonic, infrared or other<br>
electromagnetic radiation alone or in combination with chemical chaotropic agents may be used.<br><br>
