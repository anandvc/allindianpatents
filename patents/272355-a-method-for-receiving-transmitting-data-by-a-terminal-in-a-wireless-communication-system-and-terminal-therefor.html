				<td>METHOD FOR CONSTRUCTING DATA FORMAT IN MOBILE<br>
COMMUNICATION AND TERMINAL THEREOF<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a method for transmitting downlink<br>
data to a mobile terminal in mobile communications, and more particularly, to<br>
a method for constructing a data format for mobile communication and a<br>
terminal implementing such method.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
FIG 1 illustrates an exemplary basic structure of a UMTS (Universal<br>
Mobile Telecommunications System) network according to the present<br>
invention and the related art. The UMTS includes a terminal (user equipment<br>
(UE)), a UTRAN (UMTS Terrestrial Radio Access Network), and a core<br>
network (CN). The UTRAN includes one or more radio network sub-systems<br>
(RNSs). Each RNS includes a radio network controller (RNC) and a plurality<br>
of base stations (Node-Bs) managed by the RNC. One or more ceils exist<br>
for a single Node B.<br>
FIG. 2 illustrates a radio interface protocol architecture based on a<br>
3GPP radio access network specification between the UE and the UTRAN.<br>
As shown in FIG 2, the radio interface protocol has horizontal layers<br>
comprising a physical layer, a data link layer, and a network layer, and has<br>
vertical planes comprising a user plane (U-plane) for transmitting data<br>
 <br>
information and a control plane (C-plane) for transmitting control signals<br>
(signaling). The protocol layers in FIG. 2 can be divided into a first layer (L1),<br>
a second layer (L2), and a third layer (L3) based on three lower layers of an<br>
open system interconnection (OSI) standard model widely known in<br>
communication systems.<br>
Each layer In FIG. 2 will be described in more detail as follows. The<br>
first layer (L1), namely, the physical layer, provides an information transfer<br>
service to an upper layer by using a physical channel. The physical layer is<br>
connected to an upper layer called a medium access control (MAC) layer via<br>
a transport channel. Data is transferred between the MAC layer and the<br>
physical layer via the transport channel. Meanwhile, between different<br>
physical layers, namely, between a physical layer of a transmitting side and<br>
that of a receiving side, data is transferred via the physical channel.<br>
The MAC layer of the second layer provides a service to a radio link<br>
control (RLC) layer, its upper layer, via a logical channel. The RLC layer of<br>
the second layer may support reliable data transmissions and perform<br>
segmentation and concatenation on RLC service data units (SDUs)<br>
delivered from an upper layer.<br>
A radio resource control (RRC) layer located at the lowest portion of<br>
the third layer is defined only in the control plane, and handles the controlling<br>
of transport channels and physical channels in relation to establishment,<br>
reconfiguration and release of radio bearers (RBs). The radio bearer refers<br>
to a service provided by the second layer (L2) for data transmission between<br>
 <br>
the terminal and the UTRAN. In general, establishing the radio bearer refers<br>
to defining the protocol layers and the characteristics of the channels<br>
required for providing a specific service, and setting respective substantial<br>
parameters and operation methods.<br>
When an RRC layer of a particular terminal and that of the UTRAN<br>
are connected to exchange an RRC message to each other, the<br>
corresponding terminal is in an RRC connected state, and when the RRC<br>
layer of the particular terminal and that of the UTRAN are not connected, the<br>
corresponding terminal is in an idle state. The RRC connected state of the<br>
terminal may be divided into a URA_PCH state, a CELL_PCH state, a<br>
CELL_FACH state, and a CELL_DCH state. In order to reduce power<br>
consumption, terminals in the idle state, in the URA_PCH or in the<br>
CELL_PCH state discontinuously receive a PICH (Paging indicator<br>
Channel), a physical channel, and an SCCPCH (Secondary Common<br>
Control Physical Channel), a physical channel, to which a PCH (Paging<br>
Channel), a transport channel, is mapped, by using a DRX (Discontinuous<br>
Reception) method. During other time intervals than the time duration while<br>
the PICH or the SCCPCH is received, the terminal is in a sleeping mode. In<br>
the related art, the terminal performing the DRX method wakes up at every<br>
CN domain specific DRX cycle length or at every UTRAN specific DRX cycle<br>
length to receive a terminal-exclusive PI (Paging Indicator). Here, the<br>
terminal-exclusive PI in the related art is used to inform a particular terminal<br>
that a paging message will be transmitted to the particular terminal via the<br>
 <br>
PCH channel. The PICH channel is divided into 10ms-long PICH frames,<br>
and a single PICH frame consists of 300 bits. The first 288 bits of a single<br>
frame are used for the terminal-exclusive PICH to transmit one or more<br>
terminal-exclusive Pis. The rear 12 bits of the single PICH frame are not<br>
transmitted. For the sake of convenience, the portion of the front 288 bite of<br>
the PICH channel is defined as a UE PICH, and the portion of the rear 12 bits<br>
is defined as a PICH unused part.<br>
FIG 3 is a signal flow chart illustrating an RRC connection procedure<br>
between the terminal and the UTRAN according to the related art. As shown<br>
in FIG. 3, in order for the terminal in the idle state to be RRC-connected with<br>
the UTRAN, the terminal should perform an RRC connection procedure. The<br>
RRC connection procedure may include three steps: transmitting, by the<br>
terminal, an RRC connection request message to the UTRAN (S1);<br>
transmitting, by the UTRAN, an RRC connection setup message to the<br>
terminal (S2); and transmitting, by the terminal, an RRC connection setup<br>
complete message to the UTRAN (S3).<br>
An HS-DSCH transmission for transmitting high speed data to a<br>
single terminal via the downlink in the related art will now be described. The<br>
HS-DSCH has a 2 ms transmission time interval (TTI) (3 slots) and supports<br>
various modulation code sets (MCSs) to obtain a high data rate. An optimum<br>
throughput may be achieved by selecting an MCS which is most suitable for<br>
a channel situation. For this, a hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ)<br>
technique that combines an ARQ technique and a channel coding technique<br>
 <br>
can be employed to perform reliable transmissions.<br>
FIG. 4 illustrates a protocol stack of the HS-DSCH according to the<br>
related art. As shown in FIG. 4, a data unit transferred from an RLC layer of<br>
an SRNC is delivered to a MAC-d entity that manages a dedicated channel<br>
via a DICH or a DCCH, a logical channel, and the corresponding data is<br>
transferred to a MAC-hs of a Node B via a MAC-c/sh/m of an CRNC. Here,<br>
the MAC-d is a MAC entity that manages the dedicated channel, the<br>
MAC-c/sh/m is a MAC entity that manages a common channel, and a<br>
MAC-hs is a MAC entity that manages the HS-DSCH.<br>
A physical channel HS-PDSCH is used to transmit the transport<br>
channel HS-DSCH. The HS-PDSCH has a fixed 16 spreading factor and<br>
corresponds to a channelization code selected from a set of channelization<br>
codes reserved for HS-DSCH data transmission. If a multi-code<br>
transmission is performed with respect to a single UE, a plurality of<br>
channelization codes are allocated during the same HS-PDSCH sub-frame.<br>
FIG. 5 illustrates a sub-frame and slot structure of the HS-PDSCH. The<br>
HS-PDSCH transmits QPSK or 16 QAM modulation symbols. In FIG. 5, *M'<br>
indicates the number of bits per modulation symbol. Namely, in case of<br>
QPSK, 'M' is 2, and in case of 16QAM, 'M' is 4.<br>
FIG. 6 illustrates a channel configuration according to the related art.<br>
As shown in FIG. 6, in order to transmit user data via the HS-DSCH,<br>
HS-DSCH control information needs to be transmitted, and in this case, the<br>
HS-DSCH control information is transmitted via a downlink HS-SCCH (High<br>
 <br>
Speed-Shared Control Channel) and an uplink HS-DPCCH (High<br>
Speed-Dedicated Physical Control Channel). Here, a DPCH (Dedicated<br>
Physical Channel) is a bi-directional physical channel, to which the transport<br>
channel DCH is mapped, and is used to transfer terminal-exclusive data and<br>
terminal-exclusive L1 control information such as a power control signal<br>
required for controlling closed-loop power. In addition, an F-DPCH<br>
(Fractional Dedicated Physical Channel), a downlink channel, is a physical<br>
channel that transmits several DPCHs by using a single channel code. Here,<br>
a single F-DPCH does not transmit terminal-exclusive (or terminal<br>
dedicated) data of several terminals but is used to transfer<br>
terminal-exclusive L1 control information of several terminals, such as the<br>
power control signal required for controlling the closed-loop power, together.<br>
If there is a downlink F-DPCH channel, an uplink DPCH channel also<br>
operates in conjunction. In FIG. 6, a UE1, a UE2 and a UE3 use the F-DCPH<br>
via a single channel code and, in this case, each terminal provides the<br>
DPCH upwardly.<br>
The downlink HS-SCCH, a downlink physical channel, is transmitted<br>
with a spreading factor 128 and has a 60-kbps transfer rate. FIG. 7<br>
illustrates a sub-frame structure of the HS-SCCH. Information transmitted<br>
via the downlink HS-SCCH may be roughly divided into transport format and<br>
resource related information (TFRI) and HARQ-related information, and in<br>
addition, UE identifier (namely, an H-RNTI (HS-DSCH Radio Network<br>
Temporary Identifier)) information for providing information about a<br>
 <br>
particular user is masked thereto and then transmitted. Table 1 shows<br>
detailed HS-SCCH Information.<br>
 <br>
FIG. 8 shows a coding scheme of the HS-SCCH based on the above<br>
information.<br>
The uplink HS-DPCCH transmits an uplink feedback signaling related<br>
to downlink HS-DSCH data transmission. The HS-DPCCH, a dedicated<br>
channel for a particular terminal, operates cooperatively with the uplink and<br>
downlink DPCHs. The feedback signaling includes ACK<br>
(Acknowledgement)/NACK (Negative Acknowledgement) information for the<br>
HARQ and a CQI (Channel Quality Indicator). A frame of the HS-DPCCH<br>
includes five sub-frames. Each sub-frame has a length of 2ms, and a single<br>
sub-frame includes the first to third slots, namely, the three slots. Each slot<br>
of the sub-frames carries the following information: HARQ ACK/NACK<br>
 <br>
information is carried in the first slot of the sub-frames of the HS-DPCCH;<br>
and the CQI is carried in the second and third slots of the sub-frames of the<br>
HS-DSCH. The HS-DPCCH is transmitted always together with an uplink<br>
PDCCH. The CQI transfers status information of a downlink radio channel<br>
obtained from the results of the UE's measurement of a downlink CPICH<br>
(Common Pilot Channel), and the ACK/NACK provides ACK or NACK<br>
information regarding a user data packet which has been transmitted via the<br>
downlink HS-DSCH according to the HARQ mechanism. FIG. 9 illustrates a<br>
frame structure of the uplink HS-DPCCH.<br>
In the related art, when the HS-DSCH is transmitted to a particular<br>
terminal, the HS-SCCH indicates a terminal-exclusive H-RNTI (HS-DSCH<br>
Radio Network Temporary Identifier). Meanwhile, If the HS-DSCH is<br>
transmitted to several terminals, the HS-SCCH indicates a common H-RNTI.<br>
In addition, in the related art, the MAC PDU of the HS-DSCH does not<br>
include a terminal identifier (UE identifier, or UE identity).<br>
In the related art, in a particular case, the radio network may transmit<br>
the HS-DSCH to a particular terminal that has not been allocated a<br>
terminal-exclusive H-RNTI. In this case, because the particular terminal<br>
does not have a terminal-exclusive H-RNTI, the radio network informs the<br>
particular terminal about the transmission of the HS-DSCH via the common<br>
H-RNTI. Then, the particular terminal cannot determine that the HS-DSCH<br>
transmission was intended for itself, which is problematic.<br>
 <br>
TECHNICAL GIST OF THE PRESENT INVENTION<br>
Therefore, it is an object of the present invention to allow a particular<br>
terminal, which has not been allocated a terminal-exclusive H-RNTI, to<br>
receive data via a shared data channel such as an HS-DSCH by using a<br>
newly defined MAC PDU format when the HS-DSCH is transmitted by using<br>
a common H-RNTI.<br>
To achieve the above object, there is provided a method for<br>
transmitting downlink data between a radio network and a terminal in mobile<br>
communication, including: (A) receiving, by a terminal, a common identifier<br>
via a control channel associated with a shared data channel; (B) checking<br>
whether a terminal-exclusive identifier is included in a header of a MAC<br>
(Medium Access Control) PDU (Packet Data Unit) transmitted by the shared<br>
data channel; (C) acquiring a terminal-exclusive identifier if the header of the<br>
MAC PDU includes the terminal-exclusive identifier, and checking whether<br>
the acquired terminal-exclusive identifier and a terminal-exclusive identifier<br>
stored in the terminal are identical; and (D) processing the MAC PDU if the<br>
terminal-exclusive identifiers are identical.<br>
Preferably, the shared data channel is an HS-DSCH (High<br>
Speed-Dedicated Shared Channel), and the control channel is an HS-SCCH<br>
(High Speed-Shared Control Channel).<br>
Preferably, the common identifier is an H-RNTI.<br>
Preferably, the terminal-exclusive identifier included in the header of<br>
the MAC PDU is a U-RNTI (UTRAN Radio Network Temporary Identity) that<br>
 <br>
indicates a particular terminal within a UTRAN.<br>
Preferably, in step (D), if the terminal-exclusive identifiers are not<br>
identical, the MAC PDU is discarded.<br>
To achieve the above object, there is also provided a terminal<br>
including: a receiving unit that receives a particular common identifier via a<br>
control channel associated with a shared data channel in a radio network;<br>
and a processing unit that checks whether a header of a MAC PDU<br>
transmitted by the shard data channel includes a terminal-exclusive<br>
identifier, acquires a terminal-exclusive identifier of the header of the MAC<br>
PDU if the identifier is included in the header, compares the acquired<br>
terminal-exclusive identifier with a terminal-exclusive identifier stored in the<br>
terminal to determine whether they are identical, and transfers the MAC<br>
PDU (corresponding MAC SDU) to a upper MAC layer if the<br>
terminal-exclusive identifiers are identical.<br>
Preferably, if the acquired terminal-exclusive identifier is not identical<br>
to that stored in the terminal, the processing unit processes such that the<br>
received MAC PDU is discarded.<br>
Preferably, the processing unit determines a format of the MAC PDU<br>
used for transmitting the shared data channel indicated by the control<br>
channel and decapsulates (splits) the received MAC PDU according to the<br>
determined MAC PDU format.<br>
Preferably, the shared data channel refers to an HS-DSCH (High<br>
Speed-Dedicated Shared Channel) and the control channel refers to an<br>
 <br>
HS-SCCH (High Speed-Shared Control Channel).<br>
Preferably, the terminal-exclusive identifier included in the header of<br>
the MAC PDU is a U-RNTI that indicates a particular terminal within a<br>
UTRAN.<br>
According to the present invention, the mobile terminal can receive a<br>
particular common H-RNTI via the HS-SCCH associated with the HS-DSCH<br>
and recognize whether or not a header of a MAC PDU transmitted by the<br>
HS-DSCH includes a terminal-exclusive identifier, acquire the terminal-<br>
exclusive identifier. If the terminal-exclusive identifier is intended for itself,<br>
the mobile terminal can process the MAC PDU as its own, whereby even if a<br>
common H-RNTI is indicated, the particular terminal can receive the<br>
HS-DSCH.<br>

MOPE FOR CARRYING OUT THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
The present invention is applied for a UMTS communication system,<br>
communication device and communication method that can transmit<br>
downlink data to a mobile terminal. However, the present invention is not<br>
limited as such, and may be applicable to any wired/wireless communication<br>
technique.<br>
The basic concept of the present invention provides a method in<br>
 <br>
which only a particular terminal can receive data via a shared data channel<br>
(e.g., an HS-DSCH) when a common terminal identifier (e.g., a common<br>
H-RNTI) is used. In addition, the present invention provides a new format of<br>
a MAC PDU that can perform such method. Namely, a mobile terminal 1)<br>
receives a particular common identifier (e.g., the H-RNTI) via a control<br>
channel (e.g., an HS-SCCH) associated with the shared data channel, 2)<br>
checks whether a header of a MAC PDU transmitted by the shared data<br>
channel includes a terminal-exclusive identifier (e.g., a U-RNTI), and 3) if the<br>
header includes a terminal-exclusive identifier, the mobile terminal acquires<br>
the terminal-exclusive identifier, and if the terminal-exclusive identifier is<br>
intended for the mobile terminal itself, the mobile terminal processes the<br>
MAC PDU as its own.<br>
In the present invention, a format of a MAC PDU used for<br>
transmission of an HS-DSCH indicated by the HS-SCCH is determined<br>
according to the H-RNTI, the terminal identifier, received via the HS-SCCH.<br>
Namely, if the terminal identifier is different, the MAC PDU may be different.<br>
In other words, depending on whether the H-RNTI is terminal-exclusive or<br>
common, a transmitting side (network) transmits a different MAC DPU<br>
format. A receiving side (terminal) checks whether it is a terminal-exclusive<br>
H-RNTI or a common H-RNTI and decodes the MAC PDU according to the<br>
corresponding format.<br>
The terminal receives the HS-SCCH and acquires the terminal<br>
identifier H-RNTI, determines the format of the MAC DPU received via the<br>
 <br>
HS-DSCH according to the acquired H-RNTI, and decapsulates the<br>
received MAC PDU according to the determined MAC PDU.<br>
The embodiments of the present invention will now be described with<br>
reference to FIGs. 11 to 13.<br>
FIG. 11 illustrates a format of a MAC PDU according to a first<br>
embodiment of the present invention. In FIG. 11, a MAOhs header is a type<br>
of a MAC header. The MAC-hs header is a MAC entity that handles the<br>
HS-DSCH and an MAC-c is an entity that handles a common transport<br>
channel.<br>
FIG. 12 is a flow chart illustrating an operation of a terminal which has<br>
received the MAC PDU in such a format as shown in FIG. 11. The present<br>
invention will be described with reference to FIGs. 11 and 12. When the<br>
terminal receives the HS-SCCH (e.g., a control channel associated with the<br>
HS-DSCH) and acquires the terminal-exclusive H-RNTI from the HS-SCCH<br>
frame (S11), the terminal receives a MAC PDU in such a format as shown in<br>
FIG. 11 from an HS-DSCH frame which is mapped to the HS-SCCH (S12).<br>
In this case, the header of the MAC PDU as shown in FIG. 11 does not<br>
include a terminal identifier such as a C-RNTI (Cell Radio Network<br>
Temporary Identity), a U-RNTI, or an H-RNTI. Thus, the terminal recognizes<br>
(determines) that the header of the MAC PDU does not include a terminal<br>
identifier and also recognizes that the received MAC PDU has such a<br>
configuration that the header of the MAC PDU does not have a terminal<br>
identifier (e.g., the C-RNTI, the U-RNTI, or the H-RNTI) (S13, S14). If the<br>
 <br>
terminal-exclusive H-RNTI is identical to a terminal-exclusive H-RNTI stored<br>
in the terminal itself (S16), the terminal determines the received MAC PDU<br>
as its own and transfers the corresponding MAC PDU to an upper MAC layer<br>
(S17). If the terminal-exclusive H-RNTIs are not identical, the terminal<br>
discards the received MAC PDU (S18).<br>
In case that the terminal receives the HS-SCCH and acquires a<br>
CCCH-exclusive H-RNTI or a general common H-RNTI from the HS-SCCH<br>
frame, iftfie terminal receives a MAC PDU in such a format as shown in FIG.<br>
11 from the HS-DSCH frame that is mapped to the HS-SCCH frame, the<br>
terminal determines that a header of the received MAC PDU does not<br>
include a terminal identifier. In this case, after receiving the MAC PDU, the<br>
terminal transfers the corresponding MAC DPU to an upper MAC layer.<br>
FIG. 13 illustrates a format of a MAC PDU according to a second<br>
embodiment of the present invention. In FIG. 13, a MAC-hs header and a<br>
MAC-c header are types of MAC headers. The MAC-hs is a MAC entity that<br>
handles the HS-DSCH and the MAC-c is a MAC entity that handles the<br>
common transport channel.<br>
FIG. 14 is a flow chart illustrating an operation of the terminal which<br>
has received the MAC PDU in such a format as shown in FIG. 13.<br>
If the terminal receives the HS-SCCH and acquires a particular<br>
common H-RNTI from the HS-SCCH frame (S21), the terminal determines<br>
that a MAC header of a MAC PDU which has been received from an<br>
HS-DSCH frame which is mapped to the HS-SCCH includes a terminal<br>
 <br>
identifier (S22 to S24). Here, the terminal identifier included in the MAC<br>
header is the U-RNTI as shown in FIG. 13. The particular common H-RNTI,<br>
an identifier which is commonly shared and used by a plurality of terminals,<br>
serves to inform that the MAC header includes the terminal identifier.<br>
If the terminal identifier (namely, the U-RNTI) included in the MAC<br>
header is identical to that stored in the terminal (S25), the terminal<br>
determines that the received MAC PDU is intended for the terminal itself and<br>
transfers a corresponding MAC SDU to an upper MAC layer (S26). If the<br>
terminal identifiers are not identical, the terminal discards the received PDU<br>
(S27).<br>
FIG. 15 is a schematic block diagram of the terminal according to an<br>
embodiment of the present invention.<br>
The configuration and operation of the terminal according to an<br>
embodiment of the present invention will now be described with reference to<br>
FIG. 15.<br>
The terminal 100 according to an embodiment of the present<br>
invention includes any terminal used for mobile communications (e.g., UEs,<br>
mobile phones, cellular phones, DMB phones, DVB-H phones, PDA phones,<br>
PTT phones, etc), digital TVs, GPS navigation, mobile game devices, MP3s,<br>
home appliances, and the like. That is, the mobile terminal 100<br>
comprehensively includes any device to which the technical idea of the<br>
present invention can be applicable.<br>
The terminal 100 according to an embodiment of the present<br>
 <br>
invention includes a receiving unit 101 that receives a particular common<br>
identifier via the control channel (HS-SCCH) associated with the shared<br>
data channel (HS-DSCH) in the radio network (UTRAN); and a processing<br>
unit 102 that checks (recognizes or determines) whether a header of a MAC<br>
PDU transmitted by the shared data channel includes a terminal-exclusive<br>
identifier, acquires a terminal-exclusive identifier from the header of the<br>
MAC PDU if terminal-exclusive identifier is included in the header, compares<br>
the acquired terminal-exclusive identifier with a terminal-exclusive identifier<br>
stored in the terminal itself, and determines that the MAC PDU is intended<br>
for terminal itself if the two identifiers are identical, and transfers a<br>
corresponding MAC SDU to an upper MAC layer.<br>
If the acquired terminal-exclusive identifier is not identical to the<br>
terminal-exclusive identifier stored in the terminal upon comparison, the<br>
processing unit 102 discards the received MAC PDU.<br>
The processing unit 102 determines a format of the MAC PDU used<br>
for transmission of the HS-DSCH indicated by the HS-SCCH according to<br>
the terminal identifier H-RNTI which has been received via the HS-SCCH.<br>
The receiving unit 101 of the terminal 100 receives the HS-SCCH,<br>
and the processing unit 102 acquires the terminal identifier H-RNTI from the<br>
received HS-SCCH, determines a format of the MAC PDU received via the<br>
HS-DSCH according to the acquired H-RNTI, and processes the received<br>
MAC PDU according to the determined format of the MAC PDU.<br>
The terminal-exclusive identifier included in the header of the MAC<br>
 <br>
PDU is a U-RNTI that indicates a particular terminal within a single UTRAN.<br>
The particular cpmmon identifier is an H-RNTI.<br>
The processing unit 102 may be called a controller and the meaning<br>
of the name of the processing unit 102 does not limit a function and<br>
operation of the configuration. The receiving unit 101 may be called an RF<br>
module.<br>
Besides the basic elements as shown in FIG. 15, the terminal 100<br>
according to the embodiment of the present invention includes all the basic<br>
elements requisite for the terminal to apply the technique of the present<br>
invention. As such, the detailed description of certain elements shown in FIG.<br>
15 and other related elements that can be understood by those skilled in the<br>
art are omitted merely for the sake of brevity. The operation and function of<br>
each element of the terminal 100 according to the present invention are<br>
applied as it is to the corresponding parts of the description with respect to<br>
FIGs. 11 to 14.<br>
The invention being thus described, it will be obvious that the same<br>
may be varied in many ways. Such variations are not to be regarded as a<br>
departure from the scope of the invention, and all such modifications as<br>
would be obvious to one skilled in the art are intended to be included within<br>
the scope of the following claims.<br>
