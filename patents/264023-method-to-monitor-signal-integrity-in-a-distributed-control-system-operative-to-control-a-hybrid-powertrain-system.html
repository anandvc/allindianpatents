METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR MONITORING SOFTWARE AND<br>
SIGNAL INTEGRITY IN A DISTRIBUTED CONTROL MODULE<br>
SYSTEM FOR A POWERTRAIN SYSTEM<br>
CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
[0001] This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application<br>
No. 60/983,164, filed on 10/27/2007 which is hereby incorporated herein by<br>
reference.<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0002] This disclosure is related to control systems for hybrid powertrain<br>
systems.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0003] The statements in this section merely provide background<br>
information related to the present disclosure and may not constitute prior art.<br>
[0004] Known hybrid powertrain architectures can include multiple torque-<br>
generative devices, including internal combustion engines and non-<br>
combustion machines, e.g., electric machines, which transmit torque through a<br>
transmission device to an output member. One exemplary hybrid powertrain<br>
includes a two-mode, compound-split, electro-mechanical transmission which<br>
utilizes an input member for receiving tractive torque from a prime mover<br>
power source, preferably an internal combustion engine, and an output<br>
member. The output member can be operatively connected to a driveline for a<br>
motor vehicle for transmitting tractive torque thereto. Machines, operative as<br><br>
motors or generators, can generate torque inputs to the transmission<br>
independently of a torque input from the internal combustion engine. The<br>
machines may transform vehicle kinetic energy transmitted through the<br>
vehicle driveline to energy that is storable in an energy storage device. A<br>
control system is operative to monitor various inputs from the vehicle and the<br>
operator and provides operational control of the hybrid powertrain, including<br>
controlling transmission operating state and gear shifting, controlling the<br>
torque-generative devices, and regulating the power interchange among the<br>
energy storage device and the machines to manage outputs of the transmission,<br>
including torque and rotational speed. A control system can monitor input and<br>
control signals and execute algorithms to verify and secure operation of the<br>
powertrain.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
[0005] A method to monitor signal integrity in a distributed control module<br>
system operative to control a hybrid powertrain system includes establishing a<br>
communications link to transmit a signal between an originating control<br>
module and a receiving control module. The signal is generated in the<br>
originating control module. Integrity of the signal is verified within the<br>
originating control module, and a message based upon the signal is generated.<br>
The message is transmitted to the receiving control module using the<br>
communications link. The message is received at the receiving control<br>
module whereat the signal is decoded from the message. Integrity of the<br>
signal is verified within the receiving control module.<br><br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
[0006] One or more embodiments will now be described, by way of<br>
example, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:<br>
[0007] Fig. 1 is a schematic diagram of an exemplary hybrid powertrain, in<br>
accordance with the present disclosure;<br>
[0008] Figs. 2 and 3 are schematic diagrams of an exemplary architecture for<br>
a control system and hybrid powertrain, in accordance with the present<br>
disclosure; and<br>
[0009] Figs. 4, 5, and 6 are schematic flow diagrams of a control scheme, in<br>
accordance with the present disclosure.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0010] Referring now to the drawings, wherein the showings are for the<br>
purpose of illustrating certain exemplary embodiments only and not for the<br>
purpose of limiting the same, Figs. 1 and 2 depict an exemplary electro-<br>
mechanical hybrid powertrain. The exemplary electro-mechanical hybrid<br>
powertrain in accordance with the present disclosure is depicted in Fig. 1,<br>
comprising a two-mode, compound-split, electro-mechanical hybrid<br>
transmission 10 operatively connected to an engine 14 and torque machines<br>
comprising first and second electric machines ('MG-A') 56 and ('MG-B') 72.<br>
The engine 14 and first and second electric machines 56 and 72 each generate<br>
mechanical power which can be transferred to the transmission 10. The power<br>
generated by the engine 14 and the first and second electric machines 56 and<br>
72 and transferred to the transmission 10 is described in terms of input and<br><br>
motor torques, referred to herein as TI, TA, and TB respectively, and speed,<br>
referred to herein as NI, NA, and NB, respectively.<br>
[0011] The exemplary engine 14 comprises a multi-cylinder internal<br>
combustion engine selectively operative in several states to transfer torque to<br>
the transmission 10 via an input member 12, and can be either a spark-ignition<br>
or a compression-ignition engine. The engine 14 includes a crankshaft (not<br>
shown) operatively coupled to the input member 12 of the transmission 10. A<br>
rotational speed sensor 11 monitors rotational speed of the input member 12.<br>
Power output from the engine 14, comprising rotational speed and engine<br>
torque, can differ from the input speed NI and the input torque TI to the<br>
transmission 10 due to placement of torque-consuming components on the<br>
input member 12 between the engine 14 and the transmission 10, e.g., a<br>
hydraulic pump (not shown) and/or a torque management device (not shown).<br>
[0012] The exemplary transmission 10 comprises three planetary-gear sets<br>
24,26 and 28, and four selectively engageable torque-transferring devices, i.e.,<br>
clutches CI 70, C2 62, C3 73, and C4 75. As used herein, clutches refer to<br>
any type of friction torque transfer device including single or compound plate<br>
clutches or packs, band clutches, and brakes, for example. A hydraulic control<br>
circuit ('HYD') 42, preferably controlled by a transmission control module<br>
(hereafter 'TCM') 17, is operative to control and monitor clutch states.<br>
Clutches C2 62 and C4 75 preferably comprise hydraulically-applied rotating<br>
friction clutches. Clutches C1 70 and C3 73 preferably comprise<br>
hydraulically-controlled stationary devices that can be selectively grounded to<br>
a transmission case 68. Each of the clutches C1 70, C2 62, C3 73, and C4 75<br><br>
is preferably hydraulically applied, selectively receiving pressurized hydraulic<br>
fluid via the hydraulic control circuit 42.<br>
[0013] The first and second electric machines 56 and 72 preferably comprise<br>
three-phase AC machines, each including a stator (not shown) and a rotor (not<br>
shown), and respective resolvers 80 and 82. The motor stator for each<br>
machine is grounded to an outer portion of the transmission case 68, and<br>
includes a stator core with coiled electrical windings extending therefrom.<br>
The rotor for the first electric machine 56 is supported on a hub plate gear that<br>
is operatively attached to shaft 60 via the second planetary gear set 26. The<br>
rotor for the second electric machine 72 is fixedly attached to a sleeve shaft<br>
hub 66.<br>
[0014] Each of the resolvers 80 and 82 preferably comprises a variable<br>
reluctance device including a resolver stator (not shown) and a resolver rotor<br>
(not shown). The resolvers 80 and 82 are appropriately positioned and<br>
assembled on respective ones of the first and second electric machines 56 and<br>
72. Stators of respective ones of the resolvers 80 and 82 are operatively<br>
connected to one of the stators for the first and second electric machines 56<br>
and 72. The resolver rotors are operatively connected to the rotor for the<br>
corresponding first and second electric machines 56 and 72. Each of the<br>
resolvers 80 and 82 is signally and operatively connected to a transmission<br>
power inverter control module (hereafter 'TPIM') 19, and each senses and<br>
monitors rotational position of the resolver rotor relative to the resolver stator,<br>
thus monitoring rotational position of respective ones of first and second<br>
electric machines 56 and 72. Additionally, the signals output from the<br><br>
resolvers 80 and 82 are interpreted to provide the rotational speeds for first<br>
and second electric machines 56 and 72, i.e., NAand NB, respectively.<br>
[0015] The transmission 10 includes an output member 64, e.g. a shaft,<br>
which is operably connected to a driveline 90 for a vehicle (not shown), to<br>
provide output power to the driveline 90 that is transferred to vehicle wheels<br>
93, one of which is shown in Fig. 1. The output power at the output member<br>
64 is characterized in terms of an output rotational speed No and an output<br>
torque To. A transmission output speed sensor 84 monitors rotational speed<br>
and rotational direction of the output member 64. Each of the vehicle wheels<br>
93 is preferably equipped with a sensor 94 adapted to monitor wheel speed,<br>
the output of which is monitored by a control module of a distributed control<br>
module system described with respect to Fig. 2, to determine vehicle speed,<br>
and absolute and relative wheel speeds for braking control, traction control,<br>
and vehicle acceleration management.<br>
[0016] The input torque from the engine 14 and the motor torques from the<br>
first and second electric machines 56 and 72 (T|I, TA, and TB respectively) are<br>
generated as a result of energy conversion from fuel or electrical potential<br>
stored in an electrical energy storage device (hereafter 'ESD') 74. The ESD<br>
74 is high voltage DC-coupled to the TPIM 19 via DC transfer conductors 27.<br>
The transfer conductors 27 include a contactor switch 38. When the contactor<br>
switch 38 is closed, under normal operation, electric current can flow between<br>
the ESD 74 and the TPIM 19. When the contactor switch 38 is opened electric<br>
current flow between the ESD 74 and the TPIM 19 is interrupted. The TPIM<br>
19 transmits electrical power to and from the first electric machine 56 through<br>
a first motor control module ('MCP-A') 33 using transfer conductors 29, and<br><br>
the TPIM 19 similarly transmits electrical power to and from the second<br>
electric machine 72 through a second motor control module ('MCP-B') 34<br>
using transfer conductors 31 to meet the torque commands for the first and<br>
second electric machines 56 and 72 in response to the motor torques TA and<br>
TB. Electrical current is transmitted to and from the ESD 74 in accordance<br>
with whether the ESD 74 is being charged or discharged.<br>
[0017] The TPIM 19 preferably includes a hybrid control module (hereafter<br>
'HCP') 5 and the pair of power inverters and respective motor control modules<br>
33 and 34 configured to receive the torque commands and control inverter<br>
states therefrom for providing motor drive or regeneration functionality to<br>
meet the commanded motor torques TA and TB. The power inverters comprise<br>
known complementary three-phase power electronics devices, and each<br>
includes a plurality of insulated gate bipolar transistors (not shown) for<br>
converting DC power from the ESD 74 to AC power for powering respective<br>
ones of the first and second electric machines 56 and 72, by switching at high<br>
frequencies. The insulated gate bipolar transistors form a switch mode power<br>
supply configured to receive control commands. There is typically one pair of<br>
insulated gate bipolar transistors for each phase of each of the three-phase<br>
electric machines. States of the insulated gate bipolar transistors are<br>
controlled to provide motor drive mechanical power generation or electric<br>
power regeneration functionality. The three-phase inverters receive or supply<br>
DC electric power via DC transfer conductors 27 and transform it to or from<br>
three-phase AC power, which is conducted to or from the first and second<br>
electric machines 56 and 72 for operation as motors or generators via transfer<br>
conductors 29 and 31 respectively.<br><br>
[0018] Figs. 2 and 3 are schematic block diagrams of the distributed control<br>
module system of the control system. As used herein, the term 'control<br>
system' is defined as the control modules, wiring harnesses (not shown),<br>
communications links, sensors and actuators that monitor and control<br>
operation of the powertrain system. The control system monitors sensor<br>
inputs and commands outputs for controlling the actuators. The distributed<br>
control module system comprises a subset of overall vehicle control<br>
architecture, and provides coordinated system control of the exemplary hybrid<br>
powertrain described in Fig. 1. The control system includes the distributed<br>
control module system for synthesizing information and inputs, and executing<br>
algorithms to control actuators to meet control objectives, including objectives<br>
related to fuel economy, emissions, performance, drivability, and protection of<br>
hardware, including batteries of ESD 74 and the first and second electric<br>
machines 56 and 72. The distributed control module system includes an<br>
engine control module (hereafter 'ECM') 23, the TCM 17, a battery pack<br>
control module (hereafter 'BPCM') 21, and the TPIM 19. The HCP 5<br>
provides supervisory control and coordination of the ECM 23, the TCM 17,<br>
the BPCM 21, and the TPIM 19. A user interface ('UI') 13 is preferably<br>
signally connected to a plurality of devices through which a vehicle operator<br>
controls, directs, and commands operation of the electro-mechanical hybrid<br>
powertrain. The devices include an accelerator pedal 113 ('AP'), an operator<br>
brake pedal 112 ('BP'), a transmission gear selector 114 ('PRNDL'), and a<br>
vehicle speed cruise control (not shown). The transmission gear selector 114<br>
may have a discrete number of operator-selectable positions, including the<br>
rotational direction of the output member 64 to enable one of a forward and a<br><br>
reverse direction. The user interface 13 can comprise a single device, as<br>
shown, or alternatively can comprise a plurality of user interface devices<br>
directly connected to the individual control modules (not shown).<br>
[0019] The aforementioned control modules communicate with other control<br>
modules, sensors, and actuators via a communications link comprising a local<br>
area network (hereafter 'LAN') bus 6, in this embodiment. The LAN bus 6<br>
allows for structured communication between the various control modules.<br>
The specific communication protocol utilized is application-specific. The<br>
LAN bus 6 and appropriate protocols provide for robust messaging and multi-<br>
control module interfacing between the aforementioned control modules, and<br>
other control modules providing functionality including e.g., antilock braking,<br>
traction control, and vehicle stability. Multiple communications buses may be<br>
used to improve communications speed and provide some level of signal<br>
redundancy and integrity. Communications between the MCP-A 33 and the<br>
HCP 5 and between the MCP-B 34 and the HCP 5 is preferably effected using<br>
direct links preferably comprising serial peripheral interface (hereafter 'SPI)<br>
buses 37. Communication between individual control modules can also be<br>
effected using a wireless link, e.g., a short range wireless radio<br>
communications bus (not shown).<br>
[0020] The HCP 5 provides supervisory control of the hybrid powertrain,<br>
serving to coordinate operation of the ECM 23, TCM 17, MCP-A 33, MCP-B<br>
34, and BPCM 21. Based upon various command signals from the user<br>
interface 13 and the hybrid powertrain, including the ESD 74, the HCP 5<br>
determines an operator torque request, an output torque command, an engine<br>
input torque command, clutch torque(s) for the applied torque-transfer<br><br>
clutches C1 70, C2 62, C3 73, C4 75 of the transmission 10, and the motor<br>
torques TA and TB for the first and second electric machines 56 and 72. The<br>
HCP 5 sends commands to specific control modules to effect control of the<br>
engine 14, transmission 10 and the first and second electric machines 56 and<br>
72.<br>
[0021] The ECM 23 is operatively connected to the engine 14, and functions<br>
to acquire data from sensors and control actuators of the engine 14 over a<br>
plurality of discrete lines, shown for simplicity as an aggregate bi-directional<br>
interface cable 35. The ECM 23 receives the engine input torque command<br>
from the HCP 5. The ECM 23 determines the actual engine input torque, Ti,<br>
provided to the transmission 10 at that point in time based upon monitored<br>
engine speed and load, which is communicated to the HCP 5. The ECM 23<br>
monitors input from the rotational speed sensor 11 to determine the engine<br>
input speed to the input member 12, which translates to the transmission input<br>
speed, Ni. The ECM 23 monitors inputs from sensors (not shown) to<br>
determine states of other engine operating parameters including, e.g., a<br>
manifold pressure, engine coolant temperature, ambient air temperature, and<br>
ambient pressure. The engine load can be determined, for example, from the<br>
manifold pressure, or alternatively, from monitoring operator input to the<br>
accelerator pedal 113. The ECM 23 generates and communicates control<br>
signals to control engine actuators, including, e.g., fuel injectors, ignition<br>
modules, and throttle control modules, none of which are shown.<br>
[0022] The TCM 17 is operatively connected to the transmission 10 and<br>
monitors inputs from sensors (not shown) to determine states of transmission<br>
operating parameters. The TCM 17 generates and communicates actuator<br><br>
control signals to control the transmission 10, including controlling the<br>
hydraulic control circuit 42. Inputs from the TCM 17 to the HCP 5 include<br>
estimated clutch torques for each of the clutches, i.e., C1 70, C2 62, C3 73,<br>
and C4 75, and rotational output speed, NO, of the output member 64. Other<br>
actuators and sensors may be used to provide additional information from the<br>
TCM 17 to the HCP 5 for control purposes. The TCM 17 monitors inputs<br>
from pressure switches (not shown) and selectively actuates pressure control<br>
solenoids (not shown) and shift solenoids (not shown) of the hydraulic circuit<br>
42 to selectively actuate the various clutches C1 70, C2 62, C3 73, and C4 75<br>
to achieve various transmission operating range states, as described<br>
hereinbelow.<br>
[0023] The BPCM 21 is signally connected to sensors (not shown) to<br>
monitor the ESD 74, including states of electrical current and voltage<br>
parameters, to provide information indicative of parametric states of the<br>
batteries of the ESD 74 to the HCP 5. The parametric states of the batteries<br>
preferably include battery state-of-charge, battery voltage, battery temperature,<br>
and available battery power, referred to as a range PBAT_MIN to PBAT_MAX-<br>
[0024] A brake control module (hereafter 'BrCM') 22 is operatively<br>
connected to friction brakes (not shown) on each of the vehicle wheels 93.<br>
The BrCM 22 monitors the operator input to the brake pedal 112 and<br>
generates control signals to control the friction brakes and sends a control<br>
signal to the HCP 5 to operate the first and second electric machines 56 and 72<br>
based thereon.<br>
[0025] Fig. 3 shows details of the TPIM 19. The MCP-A 33 and the HCP 5<br>
are preferably signally connected to the LAN 6. MCP-A 33 and MCP-B 34<br><br>
are directly signally connected to the HCP 5 using first and second SPI buses<br>
37 which are preferably dedicated, i.e., communicate exclusively between the<br>
HCP 5 and the MCP-A 33 and the HCP 5 and the MCP-B 34, respectively.<br>
[0026] Each of the control modules ECM 23, TCM 17, HCP-5, MCP-A 33,<br>
MCP-B 34, BPCM 21, and BrCM 22 is preferably a general-purpose digital<br>
computer comprising a microprocessor or central processing unit, storage<br>
mediums comprising read only memory ('ROM'), random access memory<br>
('RAM'), electrically programmable read only memory ('EPROM'), a high<br>
speed clock, analog to digital ('A/D') and digital to analog ('D/A') circuitry,<br>
and input/output circuitry and devices ('I/O') and appropriate signal<br>
conditioning and buffer circuitry. Each of the control modules has a set of<br>
control algorithms, comprising resident program instructions and calibrations<br>
stored in one of the storage mediums and executed to provide the respective<br>
functions of each computer. Information transfer between the control modules<br>
is preferably accomplished using the LAN bus 6 and SPI buses 37. The control<br>
algorithms are executed during preset loop cycles such that each algorithm is<br>
executed at least once each loop cycle. Algorithms stored in the non-volatile<br>
memory devices are executed by one of the central processing units to monitor<br>
inputs from the sensing devices and execute control and diagnostic routines to<br>
control operation of the actuators, using preset calibrations. Loop cycles are<br>
executed at regular intervals, for example each 3.125,6.25, 12.5, 25 and 100<br>
milliseconds during ongoing operation of the hybrid powertrain.<br>
Alternatively, algorithms may be executed in response to the occurrence of an<br>
event.<br><br>
[0027] The exemplary hybrid powertrain selectively operates in one of<br>
several states that can be described in terms of engine states comprising one of<br>
an engine-on state ('ON') and an engine-off state ('OFF'), and transmission<br>
operating range states comprising a plurality of fixed gears and continuously<br>
variable operating modes, described with reference to Table 1, below.<br><br><br>
[0028] Each of the transmission operating range states is described in the<br>
table and indicates which of the specific clutches C1 70, C2 62, C3 73, and C4<br>
75 are applied for each of the operating range states. A first continuously<br>
variable mode, i.e., EVT Mode 1, or Ml, is selected by applying clutch C1 70<br>
only in order to "ground" the outer gear member of the third planetary gear set<br>
28. The engine state can be one of ON ('M1 -Eng-On') or OFF<br>
('Ml_Eng_Off). A second continuously variable mode, i.e., EVT Mode 2, or<br>
M2, is selected by applying clutch C2 62 only to connect the shaft 60 to the<br>
carrier of the third planetary gear set 28. The engine state can be one of ON<br>
('M2_Eng_On') or OFF ('M2_Eng_Off). For purposes of this description,<br>
when the engine state is OFF, the engine input speed is equal to zero<br>
revolutions per minute ('RPM'), i.e., the engine crankshaft is not rotating. A<br>
fixed gear operation provides a fixed ratio operation of input-to-output speed<br>
of the transmission 10, i.e., NI/NO. A first fixed gear operation ('Gl') is<br>
selected by applying clutches C1 70 and C4 75. A second fixed gear operation<br><br>
('G2') is selected by applying clutches C1 70 and C2 62. A third fixed gear<br>
operation ('G3') is selected by applying clutches C2 62 and C4 75. A fourth<br>
fixed gear operation ('G4') is selected by applying clutches C2 62 and C3 73.<br>
The fixed ratio operation of input-to-output speed increases with increased<br>
fixed gear operation due to decreased gear ratios in the planetary gears 24,26,<br>
and 28. The rotational speeds of the first and second electric machines 56 and<br>
72, NA and NB respectively, are dependent on internal rotation of the<br>
mechanism as defined by the clutching and are proportional to the input speed<br>
measured at the input member 12. When the transmission 10 is controlled in<br>
EVT Mode 1, the transmission 10 can be commanded to operate in the reverse<br>
direction, which is accomplished by operating the second electric machine 72<br>
in the reverse rotational direction through its motor control module in TPIM<br>
19. A neutral operating range state can be effected by deactivating all of the<br>
torque transfer clutches.<br>
[0029] In response to operator input via the accelerator pedal 113 and brake<br>
pedal 112 as captured by the user interface 13, the HCP 5 and one or more of<br>
the other control modules determine torque commands to control the torque<br>
actuators to meet the operator torque request at the output member 64 for<br>
transference to the driveline 90. The torque actuators preferably include a<br>
plurality of torque generative devices, e.g., the engine 14 and the first and<br>
second electric machines 56 and 72 and a torque transferring device<br>
comprising the transmission 10 in this embodiment. Based upon operator<br>
commands from the user interface 13, the HCP 5 determines the operator<br>
torque request and an output torque command from the transmission 10 to the<br>
driveline 90 and actuator controls including an input torque from the engine<br><br>
14, clutch torques for the torque-transfer clutches C1 70, C2 62, C3 73, C4 75<br>
of the transmission 10 and the motor torques for the first and second electric<br>
machines 56 and 72 based upon operator commands from the user interface<br>
13.<br>
[0030] Fig. 4 shows an embodiment of an architecture to control and manage<br>
signal flow in a powertrain system including torque actuators comprising<br>
multiple torque generating devices and a torque transferring device to control<br>
and manage torque transfer and power flow. The architecture is described<br>
with reference to, but not limited by, the powertrain system described<br>
hereinabove. The flow of signals through the control modules controls the<br>
torque generating devices and the torque transferring device. In operation, the<br>
operator inputs to the accelerator pedal 113 and the brake pedal 112 are<br>
monitored to determine the operator command comprising the operator torque<br>
request ('Toreq'). Operation of the engine 14 and the transmission 10 are<br>
monitored to determine the input speed ('Ni') and the output speed ('No'). A<br>
strategic optimization control scheme ('Strategic Control') 310 determines a<br>
preferred input speed ('Ni_Des') and a preferred engine state and transmission<br>
operating range state ('Hybrid Range State Des') based upon the output speed<br>
and the operator torque request, and optimized based upon other operating<br>
parameters of the hybrid powertrain, including battery power limits and<br>
response limits of the engine 14, the transmission 10, and the first and second<br>
electric machines 56 and 72. The strategic optimization control scheme 310 is<br>
preferably executed by the HCP 5 during each 100 ms loop cycle and each 25<br>
ms loop cycle.<br><br>
[0031] The outputs of the strategic optimization control scheme 310 are used<br>
in a shift execution and engine start/stop control scheme ('Shift Execution and<br>
Engine Start/Stop') 320 to operate the transmission 10 ('Transmission<br>
Commands') including commanding a change to the preferred operating range<br>
state. This includes commanding and executing a change in the operating<br>
range state if the preferred operating range state is different from the present<br>
operating range state by commanding changes in application of one or more of<br>
the clutches C1 70, C2 62, C3 73, and C4 75, and other commands. The<br>
present operating range state ('Hybrid Range State Actual') and an input speed<br>
profile ('NiProf) can be determined. The input speed profile is an estimate<br>
of an upcoming time-rate change in the input speed and preferably comprises a<br>
scalar parametric value that is a targeted input speed for the forthcoming loop<br>
cycle, based upon the engine operating commands and the operator torque<br>
request during a transition in the operating range state of the transmission, i.e.,<br>
executing a transmission shift from a first to a second operating range state.<br>
[0032] A tactical control scheme ('Tactical Control and Operation') 330 is<br>
repeatedly executed during one of the control loop cycles to determine engine<br>
commands ('Engine Commands') for operating the engine, including a<br>
preferred input torque from the engine 14 to the transmission 10 based upon<br>
the sensor inputs comprising output speed, the input speed, and the operator<br>
torque request and the present operating range state for the transmission. A<br>
clutch torque ('TCl') for each clutch is estimated in the TCM 17, including the<br>
presently applied clutches and the non-applied clutches, and a present engine<br>
input torque ('Ti') reacting with the input member 12 is determined in the<br>
ECM 23. A motor torque control scheme ('Output and Motor Torque<br><br>
Determination') 340 is executed to determine the preferred output torque from<br>
the powertrain ('To -cmd'), which includes motor torque commands ('TA, ,<br>
'TB') for controlling the first and second electric machines 56 and 72 in this<br>
embodiment. The preferred output torque is based upon the estimated clutch<br>
torque(s) for each of the clutches, the present input torque from the engine 14,<br>
the present operating range state, the input speed, the operator torque request,<br>
and the input speed profile. The first and second electric machines 56 and 72<br>
are controlled through the MCP-A 33 and MCP-B 34 to meet the preferred<br>
motor torque commands based upon the preferred output torque.<br>
[0033] Securing and monitoring signal integrity to effect torque security is<br>
described hereinbelow with reference to the hybrid powertrain system shown<br>
in Figs. 1, 2, 3, and 4, and resides in the aforementioned distributed control<br>
modules in the form of executable algorithms and calibrations. The<br>
architecture can be applied to powertrain systems having multiple torque<br>
generating devices, including, e.g., an electro-mechanical powertrain system<br>
having an engine and a single electric machine, a hybrid powertrain system<br>
having multiple electric machines, and hydraulic-mechanical hybrid<br>
powertrain systems. Controlling and managing the torque and power flow<br>
includes monitoring control system hardware, algorithms, and signal integrity.<br>
[0034] Torque security of the hybrid powertrain system can be achieved by<br>
executing integrity tests of the control system which include monitoring<br>
hardware integrity of the control system, including the wiring harnesses (not<br>
shown), communications links, sensors and actuators that monitor and control<br>
operation of the powertrain system. Torque security can be achieved by<br>
monitoring integrity of algorithms and memory devices, securing and<br><br>
monitoring signal integrity during communications within a control module<br>
and communications between the control modules, monitoring integrity of the<br>
individual control modules and processors, and executing remedial actions.<br>
Torque security in the presence of an observed fault can include limiting an<br>
actuator command signal. This can include maximum and minimum limits on<br>
actuator command signals, and maximum rates of change on actuator<br>
command signals. Specifically, motor torque commands TA and TB can be<br>
limited to maximum and minimum motor torques, and changes in the motor<br>
torque commands TA and TB can be limited to effect a maximum rate of<br>
change in output torque, e.g., 0.2g.<br>
[0035] Securing and monitoring signal integrity is preferably accomplished<br>
by individually securing the control modules and securing the serial<br>
communications links between the control modules. The distributed control<br>
module system of the embodiment preferably includes each of the torque<br>
actuators controlled by a separate control module. This embodiment includes<br>
the ECM 23 that monitors sensors and control actuators of the engine 14, the<br>
TCM 17 that monitors sensors and control actuators of the transmission 10,<br>
the MCP-A 33 that monitors sensors and control actuators of the first electric<br>
machine 56, and the MCP-B 34 that monitors sensors and control actuators of<br>
the second electric machine 72. The HCP 5 monitors inputs from and<br>
commands operation of the ECM 23, TCM 17, MCP-A 33 and MCP-B 34.<br>
The control modules communicate the signals using the LAN bus 6 and the<br>
SPI bus 37. Each of the ECM 23, MCP-A 33, MCP-B 34 and TCM 17, is<br>
responsible for closed loop monitoring and self-security based on secured<br>
commands received from the HCP 5.<br><br>
[0036] Securing and monitoring integrity of the signal includes monitoring<br>
processor integrity for each of the control modules. The processor integrity<br>
can be determined using diagnostics software that monitors data internal to the<br>
control module, and rationalizing it in one of the loop cycles. When an<br>
inconsistency between monitored data and rationalized data is detected, the<br>
inconsistency is recorded as a mismatch or a fault in a fault maturation<br>
algorithm, e.g., an X of Y routine wherein a matured fault is detected when X<br>
faults are observed out of immediately preceding Y observations of the signal.<br>
An example is detecting a matured fault when more than half the immediately<br>
preceding observations are mismatches occurring between the monitored data<br>
and the rationalized data. When the fault maturation algorithm achieves a<br>
threshold number of mismatching observations in the immediately preceding<br>
observations, the fault has matured, indicating signal corruption and a<br>
requirement for remedial action. The remedial action can be actuator-specific<br>
or across the entire control system, and places the powertrain in a torque-safe<br>
state. The remedial action will also include storing an OBD compliant code<br>
for subsequent retrieval. A diagnostic may preliminarily identify a fault<br>
pending, meaning an inconsistency has been detected but the fault maturation<br>
algorithm has not reached its threshold. The hardware integrity can be further<br>
determined using diagnostics software that monitors the sensors and actuators<br>
of the control system.<br>
[0037] Monitoring integrity of a signal that is generated and communicated<br>
in the control system comprises actions to determine whether a received signal<br>
matches the generated signal. A signal can include an operator command<br>
signal, a sensor input signal and an actuator command and control signal.<br><br>
With reference to the embodiment described hereinabove, a signal can<br>
comprise an actuator command or control signal, including, e.g., motor torque<br>
commands for the first and second electric machines 56 and 72, the input<br>
torque command to the engine 14, and clutch torque commands for the<br>
clutches C1 70, C2 62, C3 73, and C4 75 of the transmission 10. The signal<br>
can include the sensor input signal, e.g., a signal from the rotational speed<br>
sensor 11 and the transmission output speed sensor 84 and resolvers 80 and<br>
82. The signal can include an operator command, e.g., an operator input to the<br>
accelerator pedal 113, the operator brake pedal 112 and the transmission gear<br>
selector 114.<br>
[0038] When a signal is generated in an originating control module, the<br>
signal is verified within the originating control module prior to transmitting it.<br>
The signal is transmitted via one of the communications links to a receiving<br>
control module. The transmitted signal is verified in the receiving control<br>
module prior to using it for command or other operation in the receiving<br>
control module. The signal can include operator command signals including<br>
the operator inputs to the accelerator pedal 113, the operator brake pedal 112,<br>
the transmission gear selector 114 and the vehicle speed cruise control. The<br>
signal can include sensor input signals comprising states of operating<br>
parameters determined from sensor inputs. The signal can include actuator<br>
command and control signals.<br>
[0039] Securing and monitoring integrity of the signal includes verifying<br>
first and second memory locations in a memory device of the originating<br>
control module, and verifying the signal by redundantly storing the signal at<br>
the first and second memory locations in a memory device. The redundantly<br><br>
stored signals at the first and second memory locations can be compared<br>
immediately prior to transmitting the redundantly stored signals. Securing and<br>
monitoring integrity of the signal includes transmitting the redundantly stored<br>
signals via the communications link to the receiving control module, which<br>
receives and stores the transmitted redundantly stored signals in first and<br>
second memory locations. The transmitted signal is verified in the receiving<br>
control module by comparing the transmitted redundantly stored signals stored<br>
in first and second memory locations within the receiving control module.<br>
Corruption of the signal within either the originating control module or the<br>
receiving control module can be determined when a difference between the<br>
redundantly stored signals is greater than a threshold, leading the control<br>
module to execute remedial action,.<br>
[0040] Monitoring integrity of a signal that is generated and communicated<br>
in the control system comprises actions to determine whether a received signal<br>
matches the original signal. A signal can include an operator command signal,<br>
a sensor input signal and an actuator command and control signal. With<br>
reference to the embodiment described hereinabove, a signal can comprise an<br>
actuator command or control signal, including, e.g., motor torque commands<br>
for the first and second electric machines 56 and 72, the input torque<br>
command to the engine 14, and clutch torque commands for the clutches C1<br>
70, C2 62, C3 73, and C4 75 of the transmission 10. The signal can include<br>
the sensor input signal, e.g., a signal from the rotational speed sensor 11 and<br>
the transmission output speed sensor 84 and resolvers 80 and 82. The signal<br>
can include an operator command, e.g., an operator input to the accelerator<br><br>
pedal 113, the operator brake pedal 112 and the transmission gear selector<br>
114.<br>
[0041] Securing and verifying integrity of a signal that is communicated<br>
from an originating control module to a receiving control module is preferably<br>
effected by using redundant data comprising primary and secondary signals,<br>
rationalizing the primary signal, executing a dual store function prior to<br>
storing the signal, creating and transmitting a message including the signal<br>
from an originating control module to a receiving control module using the<br>
communications bus, e.g., LAN bus 6, or SPI bus 37, and receiving and<br>
decoding the received message to primary and secondary signals. The primary<br>
and secondary signals can be compared prior to processing or execution at one<br>
of the actuators.<br>
[0042] Fig. 5 shows signal flow to secure and verify integrity of an input<br>
signal to an originating control module, which comprises an input signal<br>
generated by a sensor signally connected to the originating control module in<br>
this depiction. Alternatively, the input signal in the originating control module<br>
can comprise one of an operator command signal and an actuator command<br>
and control signal. The input signal is generated (502) and is captured as a<br>
primary signal 504 and a redundant signal 504'. This can include the input<br>
signal from the sensor converted to a digital representation of the input from<br>
the sensor using an analog-to-digital converter (not shown) which may be<br>
interposed between the sensor and the originating control module.<br>
Diagnostics ('Diagnostics') are executed on both the primary signal and the<br>
redundant signal (506, 506'). Diagnostics can include limit checks that<br>
indicate when the signal is outside of a predetermined operating range for the<br><br>
signal, a rationality check of the signal, and other diagnostics check that can<br>
indicate corruption of the signal. If a corrupted signal is detected ('Signal<br>
Fault') in either or both the primary signal and the redundant signal, a default<br>
signal is generated ('Defaulting') (508, 508*) and communicated to a<br>
rationality check 510. The default signal preferably comprises a<br>
predetermined signal that is recognizable in the control module as indicating<br>
the primary signal or the redundant signal has been corrupted. When a fault is<br>
not detected ('No Fault'), the primary and/or the redundant signals are<br>
communicated to the rationality check 510. The rationality check 510<br>
compares the primary signal and the redundant signal and identifies a fault<br>
('Fault') when there is a difference detected between the primary and<br>
redundant signals. When the rationality check 510 indicates that the primary<br>
signal is valid ('Valid Signal'), the primary signal is communicated to a dual<br>
store function ('Dual Store') 511. The dual store function 511 monitors and<br>
compares present contents in first and second memory locations 512, 512' to<br>
verify integrity of the memory locations, preferably during each 6.25 ms loop<br>
cycle. When the dual store function 511 verifies integrity of the first and<br>
second memory locations, i.e., the present contents in the first and second<br>
memory locations are identical, the primary signal is stored as the primary<br>
signal in the first memory location ('Store Primary Signal') (512) and stored<br>
as a secondary signal in the second memory location ('Store Secondary<br>
Signal') (512'). The primary signal stored in the first memory location is<br>
subsequently communicated to a control path ('Primary Signal To Control<br>
Path'). The secondary signal stored in the second memory location is<br>
subsequently communicated to a security path. ('Secondary Signal To<br><br>
Security Path'). If there is a difference between the present contents of the<br>
memory locations, a fault ('Fault') is recorded indicating corruption of one of<br>
the first and second memory locations.<br>
[0043] When the rationality check 510 indicates corruption of one or both of<br>
the primary and the redundant signals, or the dual store function 511 indicates<br>
corruption of the present contents of one the first and second memory<br>
locations 512, 512' the control system identifies occurrence of the fault<br>
('Fault'). The control system determines whether the corrupted signal has<br>
matured ('Mature Fault') (514), and executes remedial action (516) to mitigate<br>
risks associated with the presence of the fault. A fault maturation algorithm<br>
can be executed, including, e.g., an X of Y routine wherein a fault has matured<br>
when X mismatched signals are observed out of immediately preceding Y<br>
signal observations. An example includes determining a fault has matured<br>
when more than half the immediately preceding observations indicate a<br>
corrupted signal.<br>
[0044] Monitoring integrity of a signal transmitted over a serial bus includes<br>
detecting missing data, e.g., detecting loss of a message frame and taking a<br>
short term mitigation action and informing the receiving control module that<br>
no new data is available. Detecting missing data also includes detecting long<br>
term loss of communications to one of the control modules and taking a<br>
remedial action.<br>
[0045] Fig. 6 shows communicating the redundantly stored signals, e.g., the<br>
dual stored signal from Fig. 5, from the originating control module to the<br>
receiving control module using a communications bus, e.g., LAN bus 6 or SPI<br>
bus 37. The originating control module generates a message ('Tx Message')<br><br>
610 to transmit. In the embodiment shown, the transmitted message 610<br>
includes words comprising other signals ('TSig_l' and TSig_2', 'TSig_4',<br>
'TSig_5' and 'TSig_6'). The primary signal being secured is preferably<br>
inserted as a third word ('TSig_3'). The subsequent word ('TSig_3_ARC')<br>
comprises an alive rolling count ('Build ARC) consisting of a two bit digital<br>
word (one of 00, 01, 10, 11) wherein the two bit word sequentially increments<br>
from 00 to 01 to 10 to 11 and repetitively cycles back to begin at 00 for<br>
consecutively generated and transmitted messages. The control module<br>
generates a fifth word ('TSig_3_PV') which preferably includes adding the<br>
alive rolling count to the primary signal and generating a protection value<br>
('Build PV). Generating the protection value preferably comprises generating<br>
a logic complement, e.g., a 2's complement, of the primary signal with the<br>
added alive rolling count.<br>
[0046] The message 610 is transmitted over one of the serial<br>
communications links (LAN bus 6 or SP1 bus 37), and received at the<br>
receiving control module as a received message ('Rx Message') 610'. The<br>
received message 610' is decoded, including determining received words<br>
('RSig- 1', 'RSig_2', 'RSig_3 'RSig_3_ARC, 'RSig_3_PV, 'RSig_4',<br>
'RSig_5' and 'RSig_6'). The third word ('RSig_3') is captured and will be<br>
stored in a predetermined memory location as a received primary signal<br>
('R/Primary Signal') subsequent to a successful rationality check 515 and a<br>
successful dual-store function 517 of memory locations 519 and 519'. The<br>
fourth word ('RSig_3_ARC') is captured and interpreted as a received alive<br>
rolling count. The received alive rolling count is compared to an expected<br>
alive rolling count, i.e., the next two bit word in the sequence from 00 to 01 to<br><br>
10 to 11 ('ARC Fault') (518). A fault is recorded if the received alive rolling<br>
count is not equal to an expected alive rolling count (518). The fifth word<br>
('RSig_3_PV') is captured and a received secondary signal ('R/Secondary<br>
Signal') is determined by generating a corresponding inverse logic<br>
complement of the fifth word and parsing out the alive rolling count ('Parse<br>
PV/Check PV). Preferably the alive rolling count from the fourth word is<br>
subtracted therefrom.<br>
[0047] The rationality check 515 compares the received primary signal and<br>
the received secondary signal and identifies a fault ('Fault') when a difference<br>
is detected, preferably prior to storing the received primary signal. When the<br>
rationality check 515 indicates that the signal is valid, the primary signal is<br>
communicated to the dual store function ('Dual Store') 517. The dual store<br>
function 517 monitors and compares present contents in first memory location<br>
519 and second memory location 519' to verify integrity of the memory<br>
locations, preferably during each 6.25 ms loop cycle. When the dual store<br>
function 517 compares and determines the contents of the first and second<br>
memory locations 519 and 519' are identical, the received primary signal is<br>
dual-stored, i.e., the received primary signal ('R/Primary Signal') is stored in<br>
both the first and second memory locations 519 and 519'. If there is a<br>
difference between the present contents of the first and second memory<br>
locations 519 and 519', a fault ('Fault') is recorded indicating corruption of<br>
one of the first and second memory locations 519 and 519' and remedial action<br>
is undertaken consistent with the specific signal.<br>
[0048] When a fault is recorded based upon the received alive rolling count<br>
not being equal to the expected alive rolling count (518), or the rationality<br><br>
check 515 indicates corruption of one or both of the primary and the redundant<br>
signals, or the dual store function 517 indicates corruption of the present<br>
contents of one the first and second memory locations, the control system<br>
identifies occurrence of the fault ('Fault'). The control system determines<br>
whether the corrupted signal has matured to a fault using a fault maturation<br>
algorithm ('Mature Fault') (521), and executes remedial action (523) to<br>
mitigate risks associated with the presence of the fault. The fault maturation<br>
algorithm can be executed to determine whether the corrupted signal has<br>
matured, including, e.g., an X of Y routine wherein a fault has matured when<br>
X mismatched signals are observed out of immediately preceding Y signal<br>
observations. An example includes determining a fault has matured when<br>
more than half the immediately preceding observations indicate a corrupted<br>
signal. As shown, there is a common fault maturation algorithm 521 for the<br>
alive rolling count comparison 518, the rationality check 515 and the dual<br>
store function 517. Alternatively, there can be individually executed fault<br>
maturation algorithms.<br>
[0049] Messages are transmitted at a rate dependent upon the<br>
communications rate of the specific bus, e.g., the LAN bus 6 or SPI bus 37,<br>
which can be 1 Mbps. In one embodiment, messages are communicated<br>
across the LAN bus 6 every 6.25 ms loop cycle. Messages can be sent serially<br>
and evaluated. The aforementioned signal monitoring software can execute a<br>
detection algorithm in one of the loop cycles to detect signal inconsistency<br>
between the primary signal and the secondary signal. When an inconsistency<br>
is detected, it is recorded as a mismatch count in a fault maturation algorithm,<br>
e.g., an X of Y routine wherein a fault is detected when X mismatched signals<br><br>
are observed out of immediately preceding Y signal observations. The control<br>
system can execute remedial action to mitigate risks associated with the<br>
presence of a fault identified by the fault maturation algorithm. An X of Y<br>
routine in which Y = 16 and in which messages are communicated across the<br>
LAN bus 6 every 6.25 ms loop cycle is able to detect and mature a fault within<br>
100 milliseconds.<br>
[0050] Detection of a fault in communications can include detecting<br>
temporary loss of data and missing data, detecting corrupted data, and no data.<br>
Detecting missing data includes detecting loss of a message frame and taking a<br>
short term mitigation action and informing the receiving control module that<br>
no new data is available. Detecting no data includes detecting a long term loss<br>
of communications to one of the control modules and taking a remedial action.<br>
When missing data is detected during communications, the control module can<br>
enter a fail-soft mode, wherein torque commands are initially held unchanged,<br>
i.e., at steady-state torque levels for a predetermined period of time and then<br>
ramped down toward zero torque command. The control modules continue to<br>
communicate, and when valid communications are reestablished, torque<br>
commands can be ramped up to achieve the operator torque request, with rate-<br>
change of the output torque controlled to effect the previously described<br>
maximum rate of change in output torque, e.g., 0.2g. When loss of<br>
communications is permanent, powertrain operation can be transitioned to a<br>
degraded state that limits output torque to a predetermined maximum level,<br>
preferably permitting some level of operation for a remainder of the key cycle.<br>
[0051] When a fault is detected in the dual store functions 511, 517, the<br>
remedial action and fault mitigation can include disabling the actuator<br><br>
controlled by the respective control module in which the fault occurred. The<br>
remedial action can be actuator-specific or system-wide, and places the<br>
powertrain in a torque-safe state. The remedial action further includes storing<br>
an OBD compliant code for subsequent retrieval. A diagnostic may<br>
preliminarily identify a fault pending, meaning data corruption or an<br>
inconsistency has been detected but the fault maturation algorithm has not<br>
reached its threshold. The hardware integrity can be further determined using<br>
diagnostics software that monitors the sensors and actuators of the control<br>
system.<br>
