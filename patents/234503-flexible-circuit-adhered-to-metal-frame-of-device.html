FLEXIBLE CIRCUIT ADHERED TO METAL FRAME OF DEVICE<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates generally to electrical circuit breakers, and, more specifically, to the assembly of electrical devices used in a circuit breaker by using flexible circuit boards.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Electrical circuit breakers typically include devices such as actuators or a solenoids for effecting the movement of certain components in response to signals from one or more control circuits. These control circuits are typically mounted on rigid circuit boards that are mounted directly beside the devices being controlled, and are connected to those devices by wires. This arrangement can create problems when space becomes critical because space must be provided not only for the mounting of the circuit board but also to allow for the installation of the board and the wires that connect it to the device it is controlling. Accordingly, from this perspective the design of circuit breakers has met a design barrier when the object is to make a circuit breaker that is both small and economical.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
A principal object of the present invention to allow the placement of electronic components that are used to control a particular electrical device in an electrical circuit breaker, such as an actuator or a solenoid, directly onto the housing of that device without requiring a significant amount of additional space.<br>
Another object of the invention is to provide a more efficient dissipation of heat generated by the control circuitry, without having to add extra components such as, for example, a cooling fan. A related object is to reduce the dielectric separation between the electronic components and a heat sink.<br>
In accordance with the present invention, the foregoing objectives are realized by a circuit breaker that comprises a controllable electrical device that includes a housing formed of heat conductive material, and a flexible circuit board which is fastened directly to at least a portion of the housing. The flexible circuit board has a circuit printed on it,<br><br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE ILLUSTRATED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Referring now to the drawings, an under voltage release 200 for use in an electrical circuit breaker comprises a flexible circuit board 201 attached to the outer surface of a metal C-shaped housing 202 containing a solenoid 203. The flexible circuit board 201 has a pair of end sections 204 and 205 that are mirror images of each other, and are connected to each other by a joining section 206 (see Figs. 2a-2c). The two end sections 204 and 205 have generally rectangular shapes that approximately resemble the shapes of a pair of side surfaces 207 and 208 of a metal housing (see Figs. 3a-3c).<br>
The joining section 206 is rectangularly shaped and extends across the bottom of the housing 202. A rectangular aperture 209 in the joining section 206 is offset toward a lead wire edge 210 where two lead wires 223 pass through a pair of holes 211 in the joining section 206. A second pair of holes for the solenoid wires are located near the opposite edge 213 of the joining section 206.<br>
The flexible circuit board 201 has an exterior surface 216 on which a plurality of electronic components 217 are mounted. On the interior surface 218, an adhesive coating is provided on the two end sections 204 and 205 to bond the flexible circuit board to the side walls of the housing 202. The interior surface 218 of the joining section 206 includes reinforcing stiffener materials 219 and 220 on opposite sides of the aperture 217 because this intermediate portion of the flexible circuit board is not supported by a corresponding surface on the C-shaped housing 202. The flexible circuit board 201 is generally made of several layers of polyimide, adhesive, and RA copper sandwiched together, with the adhesive coating on the interior surfaces of the two sections 204 and 205 as the last layer.<br>
During mounting of the flexible circuit board 201 on the housing 202, the two holes 212 are fitted over a pair of solenoid pins 221 extending downwardly from the housing adjacent to the solenoid 203. The flexible circuit board 201 is then secured to the housing 202 by soldering the solenoid pins 221 to conductors formed in the flexible circuit board 201 adjacent the holes 212. This provides a direct connection between the flexible circuit board 201 and the solenoid 203. The lead wires 223 are similarly secured to the flexible circuit board 201 by soldering the lead wires 223 to conductors formed in<br><br><br>
