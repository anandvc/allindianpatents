The invention relates to a probe assembly for determining a fluid contact level in a hydrocarbon fluid bearing formation which surrounds and/or underlays an underground borehole.<br>
In many situations one or more exploration wells are drilled into an oil and/or gas bearing formation such that the well does not reach the oil-water, the oil-gas and/or the gas-water interface in that formation.<br>
It is known from US patent No. 5,621,169 to predict the hydrocarbon/water contact level for oil and gas wells on the basis of measured data from well log and core analysis information and on basis of a worldwide correlation of permeability and porosity to a function of capillary pressure, without making actual capillary pressure measurements.<br>
European patent application 586001 discloses a method for generating by way of experimental tests with core samples, the capillary pressure curve in a porous medium.<br>
US patent No. 4,903,207 discloses a method for determining reservoir bulk volume of hydrocarbons from reservoir porosity and distance to oil-water contact level which distance is determined from log data and capillary pressure analysis of core data.<br>
US patent No. 4,282,750 discloses a tool which measures in-situ the partial water pressure in an oil bearing reservoir whilst the partial oil pressure is measured using previously known formation sampling techniques which involve taking a core sample and determining the partial pressure and density of the crude oil present in the pores.<br>
A disadvantage of the known methods is that they require complex and time consuming core sample analysis and correlation techniques.<br><br>
The present invention aims to provide a probe assembly for determining the fluid contact level in hydrocarbon fluid bearing formation in a more simple, accurate and direct manner, without require time consuming core sampling and core sample analysis procedures.<br>
In accordance with the invention there is provided a probe assembly for determining a fluid contact level in a formation, which probe assembly comprises:<br>
a first pressure probe comprising a first pressure transducer which is mounted in a measuring chamber of which one side is permeable to the first fluid and impermeable to the second fluid, which side is pressed against the borehole wall during a predetermined period of time while the pressure transducer is actuated; and<br>
a second pressure probe comprising a second pressure transducer which is<br>
mounted in a measuring chamber of which one side is permeable to the second<br>
fluid and impermeable to the first fluid, which side is pressed against the<br>
borehole wall during a predetermined period of time while the second pressure<br>
transducer is actuated.<br>
Suitably, the probe comprises an elongate probe carrier body to which the first and second fluid transducer are movably secured at diametrically opposite locations such that the transducers can simultaneously be expanded against and retracted from the borehole wall.<br>
Suitably, the first fluid is water and the second fluid is a hydrocarbon fluid, such as crude oil or natural gas, and the method is used to determine the free water level in a hydrocarbon fluid bearing formation where said free water level is located in or below the bottom of the borehole.<br>
Alternatively, the first fluid is crude oil and the sedbnd fluid is natural gas.<br><br>
In case the densities of the first and second fluid are not known, or not accurately known, it is preferred that the probe assembly is initially lowered to a first depth (I) and subsequently to a second depth (II) in the well and the pressure probes are actuated to take pore pressure measurements at each of said depths and the measurements are used to determine and/or verify the fluid densities ppi and pF2 of the first and second fluids.<br>
The invention will be described in more detail with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which<br>
Fig. 1 is a schematic longitudinal sectional view of a well in which a probe assembly according to the invention is present; and<br>
Fig. 2 is a more detailed sectional view of one of the pressure probes of the probe assembly of Fig. 1.<br>
Referring to Fig. 1 there is shown a borehole 1 which traverses an underground rock formation 2.<br>
A probe assembly 3 for measuring the depth DL of an oil-water contact level 8 in the pores of the formation 2 has been lowered into the borehole 1 on a wireline 4. The probe assembly 3 comprises a first pressure probe PI for measuring the partial pressure of any oil in the pores of the rock formation 2 surrounding the borehole 1 and a second pressure probe P2 for measuring the partial pressure of any water in the pores of the rock formation 2 surrounding the borehole 1.<br>
The probe assembly 3 furthermore comprises a pump and fluid container 5.<br>
The depth of the two probes PI and P2 is at Dp and of the oil-water fluid contact level 8 is at DL. With the probes PI and P2 the pressure in the reservoir can be measured for the selected fluids: oil and water. With the pump 5 reservoir fluids can be pumped into the container, in this way drilling fluid contaminations   can  be<br><br>
removed from the borehole wall 7. The detail of the pressure probes PI and P2 are shown in Fig. 2. A water wet filter 10 (a selective water permeable ceramic membrane) or oil wet filter (a selective oil permeable Teflon membrane) is mounted on a hollow piston 11 that can be pressed against the borehole wall. The fluid 12 in the piston 11 is miscible with the reservoir fluid to be measured, i.e. oil in the piston with the oil wet filter and water in the piston with the water wet filter 10. The phase pressures PFi and PF2 are measured by a pressure gauge 13 in each probe. After cleaning the borehole surface 7 from contaminations by pumping reservoir fluids the pump 5 is stopped and the pistons with the filters are pressed against the borehole surface 7 and the pressures recorded. From the measured partial oil and water pressures PF1 and PF2 fluid pressures, the densities of the fluids and Dp, the value of DL can be calculated from the equation:<br><br>
The probes are tested to work satisfactory in laboratory experiments where an oil pressure measuring probe and a water pressure measuring probe were pressed at opposite sides against the side wall of a cylindrical core sample from an oil bearing rock formation. During the experiments oil was flushed away by pumping water in longitudinal direction through the core sample so that an oil-water contact level was created and oil was gradually replaced by water in the pores of the sample. The partial oil and water pressures measured by the pressure probes according to the invention appeared to correlate well with the independently calculated partial oil and water pressures in pores of the sample during this experiment.<br><br><br><br><br>
WE CLAIM:<br>
1.	A probe assembly for determining a fluid contact level in a formation, which probe<br>
assembly comprises:<br>
a first pressure probe comprising a first pressure transducer which is mounted in a measuring chamber of which one side is permeable to the first fluid and impermeable to the second fluid, which side is pressed against the borehole wall during a predetermined period of time while the pressure transducer is actuated; and<br>
a second pressure probe comprising a second pressure transducer which is mounted in a measuring chamber of which one side is permeable to the second fluid and impermeable to the first fluid, which side is pressed against the borehole wall during a predetermined period of time while the second pressure transducer is actuated.<br>
2.	The probe assembly as claimed in claim 1, comprising an elongate probe carrier<br>
body to which the first and second fluid transducer are movably secured at<br>
diametrically opposite locations such that the transducers can simultaneously be<br>
expanded against and retracted from the borehole wall<br>
3.	The probe assembly as claimed in claim 1, wherein the probe assembly is designed<br>
to measure the oil-water contact level and the first pressure probe has a measuring<br>
chamber which is filled with water and has a side made of a selective water permeable<br>
ceramic membrane which is in use pressed against the borehole wall and the second<br>
pressure probe has an oil-filled measuring chamber and a side made of a selective oil<br>
permeable membrane which is in use pressed against the borehole wall.<br><br></td>
