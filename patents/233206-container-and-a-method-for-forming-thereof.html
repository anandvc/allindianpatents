				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a container, comprising a pallet, a partly foldable and disassemblable wall and a method for forming thereof.<br>
The invention relates to a container. The invention relates in paraeular to a container comprising a pallet with which the container can be picked up and moved.<br>
From practice, containers are known which comprise a bottom on which a wall can be built up by pivoting pivotable wall panels up from the bottom and connecting them mutually by means of clamps, locking pins, chps or the like. Such containers have the advantage that in empty condition they take up little space during storage and transport. However, a disadvantage of such containers is that the bottom cannot be used separately as a loose item for transport and storage of products.<br>
The object of the invention is to provide an improved container of the type described in the preamble. To that end, a container according to the invention is characterized by the features according to claim 1.<br>
In a container according to the invention, the wall is formed from wall parts, at least panels that can be stored separately from the pallet, while the pallet can be used as an independent pallet for storage and transport. Consequently, the wall can also be cleaned separately from the pallet and, for instance, be adjusted to the load to be transported.<br>
The wall is preferably manufactured from plastic, and preferably rests on the upper side of the pallet during use, that is, in set-up condition of the container.<br>
In a particularly advantageous embodiment, with a container according to the invention, on the pallet a bottom is formed which is connected or is to be connected with the wall. As a result, the top surface of the pallet is screened from the load which is included or is to be included in the inner space of the container. Moreover, during use, at least in loaded condition of the container, the bottom can prevent shifting of the wall relative to the<br><br>
pallet. A further advantage of this is that setting up the container can be simplified still further.<br>
It is then preferred that the bottom is formed from a number of bottom parts which are connected with the wall. The bottom parts may then be provided with means for mutual coupling and/or for coupling with the pallet. Mutual coupling provides the advantage that setting up is further simplified. Moreover, the bottom can, if desired, be made of moisture-tight design, in which case the coupling secures the bottom better still. It is then preferred that the bottom parts are pivotably connected with wall parts, preferably by way of integrally formed hinges such as living hinges. Such hinge means can be formed in a simple manner, are relatively strong and can moreover be made of, for instance, moisture- and duet-tight design in a simple manner. It is then preferred that the wall parts are adapted to be mutually coupled, or are mutually coupled, at least during use for storage or transport of goods such as solid or liquid products, in such a manner that<br><br>
the wall is moisture- and/or dust-tight, so that a proper protection is obtained.<br>
In a container according to the invention, in a simple manner lashing :rneans can be used for retaining the wall-during use; Such lashing means can be, for instance, securing straps or foil, or clamps with which the wall parts can be pulled against each other. Preferred are straps or the like because these are relatively simple and cheap in use and are simple to replace. Moreover, as a consequence, the wall parts do not need to have special provisions and the closure can be optimized at all times.<br>
The wall parts can be designed such that on a pallet several walls can be formed onto each other, which walls are adapted to be coupled mutually and/or with the pallet, for varying the height of the container with relatively low wall parts.<br>
If a bottom is provided, as described, it is preferably provided, on the side facing the pallet during use, with friction enhancing means such as<br>
studs, ribs, friction material or the like, so that shifting of the bottom relative to the pallet is prevented even better.<br>
The invention further relates to a set of a series of panels, for forming a container according to the invention. In particular, the invention relates to such a set characterized by the features according to claim 14..<br>
With such a set, in a particularly simple manner, a container can be obtained having a suitable inner space for storage of different products, which can rest on the bottom formed by the bottom panels.<br>
The bottom parts are preferably provided with cooperating coupling raeana, so that they can be mutually secured to each other. The bottom parts are then preferably formed such that they can jointly form a closed bottom, in particular a substantially rectangular bottom which substantiaJly corresponds in dimension and shape to a modular form of a pallet, for instance a Euro pallet. The wall parts of the panels are preferably provided with further coupling means for supporting the wall parts against each other and/or coupling them mutually, for obtaining a relatively stiff outer form.<br>
In a particularly advantageous embodiment, a set according to the invention comprises at least three different panels, which panels are distinguished from each other in at least the width of the wall parts and/or the shape of the bottom parts. The different panels of this set are adapted to be mutually coupled, such that through a suitable choice of the panels different dimensions and shapes of the inner space can be obtained.<br>
The invention further relates to a method for forming a container, characterized by the features according to claim 19.<br>
Such a method provides the advantage that a container can be set up and collapsed again in a particularly simple manner, so that a container can be obtained which in set-up condition has an inner space of suitable size and in collapsed condition takes up minimal space, while moreover for instance standard pallets can be used.<br>
A method according to the invention is preferably characterized in that on a pallet a bottom is formed from bottom panels which are connected or are to be connected with at least a number of the wall parts, such that an inner space is defined by the wall parts above the bottom. The bottom is then preferably assembled so as to be moisture-tight, while the bottom parts are preferably mutually coupled.<br>
The invention furthermore relates to a method for the transport of products, characterized by the features according to claim 24.<br>
In a particularly advantageous embodiment thereof, the wall of the<br>
container is formed around the products which have been disposed on a<br>
pallet, so that loading is possible in a particularly simple manner. jFor<br>
unloading, the wall can then be removed, so that the products are readily<br>
accessible from a side.	,<br>
In. a particularly advantageous embodiment, on the pallet, prior to placement of the products, a bottom is formed from bottom parts connected or to be connected with the 'wall, so that the load will rest on the bottom and is physically separated from the pallet. This provides the advantage that the choice of the pallet, in particular the material thereof, is not, at least less dependent on the load.<br>
Thus, with a method according to the present invention, for instance liquid or paste-like, low- or high-viscous fluids can be transported on wooden, pallets, while the bottom prevents parts of the pallet, such a splinters and dirt which may have been left on it, coming into contact with the liquid or paste. Thus, for instance base materials for manufacturing rubber and the like can be transported on wooden pallets. However, other pallets can naturally be used as well, for instance made of plastic or metal. Moreover, particular cleaning of the pallets is then not necessary anymore.<br><br>
In the further eubdaims, further advantageous embodiments of the invention ace set forth. To clarify the invention, exemplary embodiments thereof will be further elucidated with reference to the drawing, wherein:<br>

In this description, the same or corresponding parts have the same or corresponding reference numerals. In the following figures, exemplary embodiments of containers according to the invention are shown, in different exemplary embodiments, which should not be construed as limiting the invention.<br>
Fig. 1 shows two perspective views of a container 1 according to the invention, in two different exemplary embodiments. On the left in Fig. 1, a container 1 is shown with a plastic pallet 2 on which a plastic wall 3 has been set up, while on the right-hand side in Fig. 1 a comparable container with a wall. 3 is shown on a wooden pallet 2. The wall 3 comprises four1 panels 4, which are, or can be, mutually connected, in a manner to be further described hereinafter, thereby enclosing an inner space 5, which is enclosed by the wall 3 and the pallet 2 and is open towards the top.<br>
Optionally, a cover can be provided (not shown). Such a cover can be provided separately from the -wall 3, but may also be connected with a panel 4 or built up from different parts connected with different panels 4.<br>
Fig. 2 shows a pallet 2, in particular a substantially plastic pallet 2, as shown in Fig. 1 on the left-hand side. This pallet 2 comprises a top surface 6 and a series, three in the exemplary embodiment shown, of carriers 7, which, as in prior art pallets, extend next to each other, such that under the top surface 6, between the carriers 7, blade insertion openings 8 are provided. At right angles thereto, blades can be inserted through recesses 9<br><br>
between the carriers 7 and the top surface 6. Such a general structure of a pallet 2 is sufficiently known.<br>
In the pallet 2 as shown in Fig. 2, in the top surface 6, adjacent the four sides 10, insertion openings 11 are provided, regularly spaced apart. In the exemplary embodiment shown, a Euro pallet is shown, with four insertion ' openings 11 provided on the long sides and two on the short side. As will be described in more detail hereinafter with reference to Fig. 9, stiffening means may be provided in the pallet.<br>
Figs. 3 and 4 shows in two steps how on a pallet 2 according to Fig. 2 a container 1 according to the invention can be built up, in a first embodiment, using four panels 4. As shown in Fig. 3, first, two identical panels 4 with lips 13, which extend at the lower end thereof, as shown in Fig. 10, are inserted in the insertion openings 11 and brought to a vertical position. This movement is schematically indicated by the two mirrored arrows Pi. Next, a second set of panels 4 with comparable lips 13 are inserted in the insertion openings 11 on the short side of the pallet 2 and brought to a vertical position, as schematically represented in Fig. 4 by the arrows Pg. The first-placed panels 4A are provided with recesses 15 at jfcheir longitudinal edges 14 arranged vertically in Fig. 4. The two other panels 4B<br><br>
are provided at their vertical longitudinal edges 16 with complementary<br>
projections 17, which can engage in the recesses 15, such that the walls are locked against each other, at least to some extent.<br>
Next, as shown in Fig. 5, securing straps 18 or like hinding means are fitted around the four panels 4A, 4B, so that the four wall panels 4A, 4B are pulled firmly against each other and define the inner space 5 uniformly. When disassembling the container 1, the securing straps 18 can he simply detached, cut or otherwise removed, such that the four panels 4A, 4B can be taken from the pallet 2 in reverse order.<br>
As shown in Fig. 10, it is preferred that the lips 13 in the position, shown in Fig. 4 are slightly rounded towards the inner lower side, and on the outwardly directed side are provided with an outwardly reaching Up 19 which, when fitting the panels 4A, can engage under the top surface 6 of the pallet 2 when the panel 4A is being pivoted upwards from the position<br><br>
shown in Figs. 3 and 10 to a vertical position after the edges 19 have been inserted into the insertion openings 11. Thus, the wall 4 is fixedly connected with the pallet, at least cannot become detached from it other than by detaching the panels.<br>
Figs. 6-8 show an alternative embodiment of a container 1 according to the invention, comprising a pallet 2 and a foldable wall 4. In this embodiment, the pallet 2 is provided with a top surface 6 having under it nine regularly spaced apart legs 7 for admitting lifting blades under the top surface 6, from four different sides. Along its circumferential edge, the top surface $ is provided with a stepped surface 20, for reasons jto be further mentioned hereinafter.<br>
The wall 3 comprises four panels 4A, 4B, each provided at the lower longitudinal edge with three projections 13. Right above the projections 13, on the side of each panel 4A, 4B facing inwards, extends a slot 21 having such dimensions that the respective panel 4A, 4B can be moved by this slot 21 over the lower step 22 of the stepped surface 20, such that the projections<br>
13 of the respective panel 4A, 4B extend next to the legs 7 on the respective side of the pallet 2. This is shown in Fig. 7.<br>
In Fig. 7 the pallet 2 is placed through its legs 7 on a base surface, and the panels 4A, 4B have been brought in a substantially vertical position. As appears clearly from Fig. 7, the panels 4A, 4B are provided at their two longitudinal edges 14,16 with lips 24, such that when two longitudinal edges 14,16 of two panels 4A, 4B are moved against each other, the lips 24 of the first panel 4A fit between the lips 24 of the second panel 4B. Each Up is provided with a bore 25, such that in the above-mentioned position of the lips 24 fitted between each other (Fig. 7), a through bore 25 is obtained, through which, for instance, a pin 26 can be inserted (Fig. 8), thereby forming a hinge of the piano hinge type. In this way, a folding wall is obtained which can be simply folded around the pallet 2, with the lower step 22 of the pallet 2 being received in the slot 21, for locking the pallet 2.<br>
When the entire wall 3 is closed, as shown in Fig. 8, optionally, securing means 18 or the like may be provided for pulling the two wall parts 4A, 4B to be closed last, against each other. In the embodiment shown in Fig. 8, the securing means 18 are relatively short securing straps which embrace only one corner 24A of the container 1. Naturally, continuous securing straps, ropes, shrink foil or the like can be used for locking the panels 4. Also, in each of the corners 24, a pin 26 may be inserted through the openings 25 to obtain the locking referred to.<br>
As appears clearly from Fig. 8, the corner 24A shown on the right-hand side is formed by lips 24 extending slightly out of the plane of the panel 4A, such that the pin 26 is situated outside that plane. The advantage thus achieved is that the four panels 4A, 4B can be folded to the position shown in Fig. 6. Naturally, this can also be achieved by removing all of the pins 26, such that the panels 4A, 4B can be stacked.<br>
Fig. 9 represents a pallet 2 according to Figs. 2 and 10 in disassembled condition, clearly showing that stiffening means 12 in the form of metal or<br>
plastic strips 28 have been received between the carriers 7 and the top surface 6. In the underside of the top surface 6, recesses 27 are provided, in which tubular studs 29 of the carriers 7 can be secured, for instance through gluing or the like. The recesses 27 can be closed off, for instance, by caps 30, which caps may extend into the tubular studs 29.<br>
These and many comparable variations for forming such a pallet 2 will be immediately clear to one skilled in the art.<br>
Fig. 11 shows a further alternative embodiment of a container 1 according to the invention, in disassembled condition. Fig. 12 shows how it can be set up.<br>
Fig. 11 shows a pallet 2 which can be of any type, for instance as shown in this application or a normal wooden pallet. The pallet 2 has a top surface<br>
6 of a standard dimension, for instance a Euro pallet. Two pairs of wall<br><br>
panels 4A, 4B are provided with a width Bi, 62, respectively corresponding to the width and the length of the top surface 6 of the pallet 2. Each wall panel 4A, 4B comprises a wall part 31 and a bottom part 32 pivotably connected thereto. Wall part 31 and bottom part 32 can be connected, for instance, by a piano hinge-type hinge 33, but are preferably connected through an integrally formed hinge, for instance a living hinge. However, other types of binges can also be used.<br>
Each bottom part 32 has a substantially triangular shape, one side of the triangle bounding the hinge 33 or forming a part thereof. The two other sides 35 include an angle a and.p, respectively, at the bottom panels 32 of the first wall parts 4A and the second wall parts 4B. The angles a and p are selected such that 2oc + 2p is approximately 360°. Of each bottom panel 32, a first free longitudinal edge 35A is provided with a first coupling means 36, while the other free longitudinal edge 35B of the respective bottom parj 32 is provided with a second coupling means 37. In the embodiment shown, the first coupling means 36 and the second coupling means 37 are designed as<br><br>
coupling pieces of a jigsaw puzzle and have a form-closed mutual fit. However, other types of coupling means can be used, such that two bottom parts 32 can be mutually coupled, sxich that they cannot shift relative to each other, as shown in Fig. 12.<br>
As shown in Fig. 12, the panels 4A, 4B can be placed in pairs opposite each other, such that the bottom parts 32 thereof overlie the top surface 6 of the pallet 2, the first and second coupling means 36,37of two adjacent bottom parts 32 being interlocked like pieces of a jigsaw puzzle, such that the four bottom panels 32 are mutually secured against shifting. The bottom parts 32 are then preferably of such dimension that they jointly cover the entire top surface 6 of the pallet 2 and the hinges 33 extend approximately along the longitudinal edges of the top surface 6. It will be clear that, next, the wall parts 31 can be pivoted in the directions Pi and Pz, respectively, to a vertical position around the hinges 33, such that the longitudinal edges 14,16 thereof link up with each other. Next, the securing straps or like securing means, as described above, can be fitted around the thus formed wall 3, for locking the wall parts 31 in the above-mentioned condition, thereby enclosing ah inner space 5.<br>
Since the top surface 6 of the pallet 2 in this embodiment is covered entirely by the bottom parts 32, material that is introduced into the inner space 5 cannot come into contact with the top surface 6 of the pallet 2. Therefore, any pallet 2 can be used, regardless of whether it is clean. This is advantageous in particular in the case of transport of material that is susceptible to contamination, such as, for instance, liquids, in particular high-viscous liquids, pastes, foodstuffs and the like. Thus, with a container 1 according to the invention, in particular according to Figs. 11 and 12, for instance base material for the manufacture of plastic or rubber can be transported, without this entailing the danger of parts of the pallet, such as, for instance, wood splinters, ending up in the base material during<br>
transport and/or storage. This example should not be construed as limiting in any way.<br>
It will be clear that in every embodiment shown, the panels 4A, 4B, at least the wall parts 31, can be provided with cooperating coupling means, such as clamping means, friction means, form-closed means, magnetic means or the like for fastening the panels and wall parts to or against each other. Of importance is only that the wall 3 during storage and transport of material is substantially form-retaining and the panels 4A, 4B, at least the wall, parts 31, cannot become detached from each other.<br>
It will be clear that with each of the exemplary embodiments shown, a bottom may be provided in the manner as shown in Figs. 11 and 12. In a container 1 according to the invention, longitudinal edges and/or coupling means can be designed such that with them substantially moisture-tight connections can be obtained between abutting panels 4A, 4B, wall parts 31 and moisture-tight connection of the wall 3 to the pallet 2. To that end, for instance; plastic or rubber profiles can be used. In this way, a moisture-tight container 1 can be obtained which is still simply detachable.<br>
In the use of a plastic pallet, such as, for instance, shown in Figs. 2, 9 and 10, the advantage is achieved that the pallet is particularly simple to service, in particular to clean, that it is simple to manufacture and to use, and moreover can be resistant in a simple manner to a variety of materials to be transported in the container.<br>
A container according to the invention can be set up to the position shown in the different figures, thereby enclosing an inner space, after which the inner space can be filled with a load, for instance general goods, bulk goods, possibly liquids, pastes and the like.<br>
In an alternative embodiment, however, first a load can be stacked'onto the pallet 2, possibly on top of the bottom parts 32, after which the panels 4A, 4B, at least the wall parts 31, are pivoted to the vertical position shown, thereby enclosing the load, after which the wall 3 can be secured in the<br><br>
manner described above. In this way, loading and unloading the pallet is enabled in a particularly simple manner. Evidently, unloading the container can be done in reverse order. Further, also, for instance two or three panels<br><br>
4, at least wall parts 31, can be brought to the vertical position, prior to placement of the load, after which the or each further panel or wall part is closed against the load.<br>
In a container 1 according to the invention where bottom panels 32 are used, as shown in Figs. 11 and 12, the advantage is achieved that the<br>
bottom parts 32 and the wall parts 31, owing to the load, are pressed firmly<br>
onto the pallet 2 and secured against shifting. Naturally, further means may be provided to prevent shifting relative to the pallet 2, for instance friction means, mortise and tenon joints and the like. Through adjustment of dimensions and the shape of the bottom panels 32, in particular the included angle a and/or p, naturally, containers of different dimensions can<br><br>
be manufactured in a manner as shown in Figs. 11 and 12. Also, bottom panels can be used which are, for instance, trapezoidal, optionally in combination with bottom panels having the triangular shape shown, such that with a limited number of different panels 4A, 4B, a large number of different containers 1 can be formed.    .<br>
The invention is not limited in any way to the exemplary embodiments shown in the drawing and the description. Many variations thereon are possible within the framework of the invention outlined by the claims.<br>
Thus, for instance, for parts of a container 1 according to the invention, other materials than plastic can be used and the walls can be built up in a different manner.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
