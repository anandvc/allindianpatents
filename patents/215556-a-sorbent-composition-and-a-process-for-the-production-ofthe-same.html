				<td>This invention relates to a sorbent composition and a process<br>
for the production of the same.<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
This invention relates to the removal of sulfur from fluid streams of<br>
cracked-gasolines and diesel fuels. In another aspect this invention relates to<br>
sorbent compositions suitable for use in the desulfurization of fluid streams of<br>
cracked-gasolines and diesel fuel. A further aspect of this invention relates to a<br>
process for the production of sulfur sorbents for use in the removal of sulfur bodies<br>
from fluid streams of cracked gasolines and diesel fuels.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
The need for cleaner burning fuels has resulted in a continuing world<br>
wide effort to reduce sulfur levels in gasoline and diesel fuels. The reducing of<br>
gasoline and diesel sulfur is considered to be a means for improving air quality<br>
because of the negative impact the fuel sulfur has on the performance of automotive<br>
catalytic converters. The presence of oxides of sulfur in automotive engine exhaust<br>
inhibits and may irreversibly poison noble metal catalysts in the converter.<br>
Emissions from an inefficient or poisoned converter contain levels of non-<br>
combusted, non-methane hydrocarbon and oxides of nitrogen and carbon monoxide.<br>
Such emissions are catalyzed by sunlight to form ground level ozone, more<br>
commonly referred to as smog.<br>
Most of the sulfur in gasoline comes from the thermally processed<br>
gasolines. Thermally processed gasolines such, as for example, thermally cracked<br>
gasoline, visbreaker gasoline, coker gasoline and catalytically cracked gasoline<br>
(hereinafter collectively called "cracked-gasoline") contains in part olefins,<br>
aromatics, and sulfur-containing compounds.<br>
Since most gasolines, such as for example automobile gasolines,<br>
racing gasolines, aviation gasoline and boat gasolines contain a blend of at least in<br>
part cracked-gasoline, reduction of sulfur in cracked-gasoline will inherently serve<br>
to reduce the sulfur levels in such gasolines.<br>
The public discussion about gasoline sulfur has not centered on<br>
whether or not sulfur levels should be reduced. A consensus has emerged that<br>
lower sulfur gasoline reduces automotive emissions and improves air quality. Thus<br><br>
the real debate has focused on the required level of reduction, the geographical areas<br>
in need of lower sulfur gasoline and the time frame for implementation.<br>
As the concern over the impact of automotive air pollution continues,<br>
it is clear that further efforts to reduce the sulfur levels in automotive fuels will be<br>
required. While the current gasoline products contain about 330 part per million<br>
with continued efforts by the Environmental Protection Agency to secure reduced<br>
levels, it has been estimated that gasoline will have to have less than 50 part per<br>
million of sulfur by the year 2010. (See Rock, K.L., Putman H.M., Improvements<br>
in FCC Gasoline Desulfurization via Catalytic Distillation" presented at the 1998<br>
National Petroleum Refiners Association Annual Meeting (AM-98-37)).<br>
In view of the ever increasing need to be able to produce a low sulfur<br>
content automotive fuel, a variety of processes have been proposed for achieving<br>
industry compliance with the Federal mandates.<br>
One such process which has been proposed for the removal of sulfur<br>
from gasoline is called hydrodesulfurization. While hydrodesulfurization of gasoline<br>
can remove sulfur-containing compounds, it can result in the saturation of most, if<br>
not all, of the olefins contained in the gasoline. This saturation of olefins greatly<br>
affects the octane number (both the research and motor octane number) by lowering<br>
it. These olefins are saturated due to, in part, the hydrodesulfurization conditions<br>
required to remove thiophenic compounds (such as, for example, thiophene, benzo-<br>
thiophene, alkyl thiophenes, alkylbenzothiphenes and alkyl dibenzothiophenes),<br>
which are some of the most difficult sulfur-containing compounds to remove.<br>
Additionally, the hydrodesulfurization conditions required to remove thiophenic<br>
compounds can also saturate aromatics.<br>
In addition to the need for removal of sulfur from cracked-gasolines,<br>
there is also presented to the petroleum industry a need to reduce the sulfur content<br>
of diesel fuels. In removing sulfur from diesel by hydrodesulfurization, the cetane<br>
is improved but there is a large cost in hydrogen consumption. This hydrogen is<br>
consumed by both hydrodesulfurization and aromatic hydrogenation reactions.<br>
Thus there is a need for a process wherein desulfurization without<br>
hydrogenation of aromatics is achieved so as to provide a more economical process<br>
for the treatment of diesel fuels.<br><br>
As a result of the lack of success in providing successful and<br>
economically feasible processes for the reduction of sulfur levels in both cracked-<br>
gasolines and diesel fuels, it is apparent that there is still needed a better process for<br>
the desulfurization of both cracked-gasolines and diesel fuels which has minimal<br>
affect of octane while achieving high levels of sulfur removal.<br>
The present invention provides a novel sorbent system for the<br>
removal of sulfur from fluid streams of cracked-gasolines and diesel fuels.<br>
The invention also provides a process for the production of novel<br>
sorbents which are useful in the desulfurization of such fluid streams.<br>
The invention further provides a process for the removal of sulfur-<br>
containing compounds from cracked-gasolines and diesel fuels which minimize<br>
saturation of olefins and aromatics therein.<br>
The invention yet further provides a desulfurized cracked-gasoline<br>
that contains less than about 100 parts per million of sulfur based on the weight of<br>
the desulfurized cracked-gasoline and which contains essentially the same amount of<br>
olefins and aromatics as were in the cracked-gasoline from which it is made.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
The present invention is based upon our discovery that through the<br>
utilization of nickel in a substantially reduced valence state, preferably zero, in a<br>
sorbent composition there is achieved a novel sorbent composition which permits<br>
the ready removal of sulfur from streams of cracked-gasolines or diesel fuels with a<br>
minimal effect on the octane rating of the treated stream.<br>
Accordingly, in one aspect of the present invention there is provided<br>
a novel sorbent suitable for the desulfurization of cracked-gasolines or diesel fuels<br>
which is comprised of zinc oxide, silica, alumina and nickel wherein the valence of<br>
the nickel is substantially reduced and such reduced valence nickel is present in an<br>
amount to permit the removal of sulfur from cracked-gasolines or diesel fuels.<br>
In accordance with another aspect of the present invention, there is<br>
provided a process for the preparation of a novel sorbent composition which<br>
comprises admixing zinc oxide, silica and alumina so as to form a wet mix, dough,<br>
paste or slurry thereof, particulating the wet mix, dough, paste or slurry thereof so<br>
as to form a particulate granule, extrudate, tablet, sphere, pellet or microsphere<br><br>
thereof; drying the resulting particulate; calcining the dried paniculate; impregnating<br>
the resulting solid paniculate with a nickel or a nickel-containing compound; drying<br>
the resulting impregnated solid paniculate composition, calcining the dried<br>
paniculate composition and reducing the calcined product with a suitable reducing<br>
agent, such as hydrogen, so as to produce a sorbent composition having a substantial<br>
zero valence nickel content in an amount which is sufficient to permit the removal<br>
with same of sulfur from a cracked-gasoline or diesel fuel stream.<br>
In accordance with a further aspect of the present invention, there is<br>
provided a process for the desulfurization of a cracked-gasoline or diesel fuel stream<br>
which comprises desulfurizing in a desulfurization zone a cracked-gasoline or diesel<br>
fuel with a solid-reduced nickel metal-containing sorbent, separating the<br>
desulfurized cracked-gasoline or diesel fuel from the sulfurized sorbent,<br>
regenerating at least a portion of the sulfurized-solid-reduced nickel metal<br>
metal-containing sorbent to produce a regenerated desulfurized solid nickel metal<br>
metal-containing sorbent; activating at least a portion of the regenerated desulfurized<br>
solid nickel metal-containing sorbent to produce a solid reduced nickel metal<br>
metal-containing sorbent; and thereafter returning at least a portion of the resulting<br>
reduced nickel metal-containing sorbent to the desulfurization zone.<br>
Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
The term "gasoline" as employed herein is intended to mean a<br>
mixture of hydrocarbons boiling from about 100°F to approximately 400°F or any<br>
fraction thereof. Such hydrocarbons will include, for example, hydrocarbon streams<br>
in refineries such as naphtha, straight-run naphtha, coker naphtha, catalytic gasoline,<br>
visbreaker naphtha, alkylate, isomerate or reformate.<br>
The term "cracked-gasoline" as employed herein is intended to mean<br>
hydrocarbons boiling from about 100°F to approximately 400°F of any fraction<br>
thereof that are products from either thermal or catalytic processes that crack larger<br>
hydrocarbon molecules into smaller molecules. Examples of thermal processes<br>
include coking, thermal cracking and visbreaking. Fluid catalytic cracking and<br>
heavy oil cracking are examples of catalytic cracking. In some instances the<br>
cracked-gasoline may be fractionated and/or hydrotreated prior to desulfurization<br>
when used as a feed in the practice of this invention.<br><br>
The term "diesel fuel" as employed herein is intended to mean a fluid<br>
composed of a mixture of hydrocarbons boiling from about 300°F to approximately<br>
750°F or any fraction thereof. Such hydrocarbon streams include light cycle oil,<br>
kerosene, jet fuel, straight-run diesel and hydrotreated diesel.<br>
The term "sulfur" as employed herein is intended to mean those<br>
organosulfur compounds such as mercaptans or those thiophenic compounds<br>
normally present in cracked gasolines which include among others thiophene,<br>
benzothiophene, alkyl thiophenes, alkyl benzothiophenes and alkyldibenzothiophenes<br>
as well as the heavier molecular weights of same which are normally present in a<br>
diesel fuel of the types contemplated for processing in accordance with the present<br>
invention.<br>
The term "gaseous" as employed herein is intended to mean that state<br>
in which the feed cracked-gasoline or diesel fuel is primarily in a vapor phase.<br>
The term "substantially reduced nickel valence" as employed herein is<br>
intended to mean that a large portion of the valence of the nickel component of the<br>
composition is reduced to a value of less than 2, preferably zero.<br>
The present invention is based upon the discovery of applicants that a<br>
substantially reduced valence nickel component in a paniculate composition<br>
comprising zinc oxide, silica, alumina and nickel results in a sorbent which permits<br>
the removal of thiophenic sulfur compounds from fluid streams of cracked-gasolines<br>
or diesel fuels without having a significant adverse affect of the olefin content of<br>
such streams, thus avoiding a significant reduction of octane values of the treated<br>
stream. Moreover, the use of such novel sorbents results in a significant reduction<br>
of the sulfur content of the resulting treated fluid stream.<br>
In a presently preferred embodiment of this invention, the sorbent<br>
composition has a nickel content in the range of from about 5 to about 50 weight<br>
percent.<br>
The zinc oxide used in the preparation of the sorbent composition can<br>
either be in the form of zinc oxide, or in the form of one or more zinc compounds<br>
that are convertible to zinc oxide under the conditions of preparation described<br>
herein. Examples of such zinc compounds include, but are not limited to, zinc<br>
sulfide, zinc sulfate, zinc hydroxide, zinc carbonate, zinc acetate, and zinc nitrate.<br><br>
Preferably, the zinc oxide is in the form of powdered zinc oxide.<br>
The silica used in the preparation of the sorbent compositions may be<br>
either in the form of silica or in the form of one or more silicon-containing<br>
compounds. Any suitable type of silica may be employed in the sorbent<br>
compositions of the present invention. Examples of suitable types of silica include<br>
diatomite, silicalite, silica colloid, flame-hydrolyzed silica, hydrolyzed silica, silica<br>
gel and precipitated silica, with diatomite being presently preferred. In addition,<br>
silicon compounds that are convertible to silica such as silicic acid, sodium silicate<br>
and ammonium silicate can also be employed. Preferably, the silica is in the form<br>
of diatomite.<br>
The starting alumina component of the composition can be any<br>
suitable commercially available alumina material including colloidal alumina<br>
solutions and, generally, those alumina compounds produced by the dehydration of<br>
alumina hydrates.<br>
The zinc oxide will generally be present in the sorbent composition in<br>
an amount in the range of from about 10 weight percent to about 90 weight percent,<br>
preferably in an amount in the range of from about 15 to about 60 weight percent,<br>
and more preferably in an amount in the range of from about 45 to about 60 weight<br>
percent, when such weight percents are expressed in terms of the zinc oxide based<br>
upon the total weight of the sorbent composition.<br>
The silica will generally be present in the sorbent composition in an<br>
amount in the range of from about 5 weight percent to about 85 weight percent,<br>
preferably in an amount in the range of from about 20 weight percent to about 60<br>
weight percent when the weight percents are expressed in terms of the silica based<br>
upon the total weight of the sorbent composition.<br>
The alumina will generally be present in the sorbent composition in<br>
an amount in the range of from about 5.0 weight percent to about 30 weight<br>
percent, preferably from about 5.0 weight percent to about 15 weight percent when<br>
such weight percents are expressed in terms of the weight of the alumina compared<br>
with the total weight of the sorbent system.<br>
In the manufacture of the sorbent composition, the primary<br>
components of zinc oxide, silica and alumina are combined together in appropriate<br><br>
proportions by any suitable manner which provides for the intimate mixing of the<br>
components to provide a substantially homogeneous mixture.<br>
Any suitable means for mixing the sorbent components can be used<br>
to achieve the desired dispersion of the materials. Such means include, among<br>
others, tumblers, stationary shells or troughs, Muller mixers, which are of the batch<br>
or continuous type, impact mixers and the like. It is presently preferred to use a<br>
Muller mixer in the mixing of the silica, alumina and zinc oxide components.<br>
Once the sorbent components are properly mixed to provide a<br>
shapeable mixture, the resulting mixture can be in the form of wet mix, dough,<br>
paste or slurry. If the resulting mix is in the form of a wet mix, the wet mix can be<br>
densified and thereafter particulated through the granulation of the densified mix<br>
following the drying and calcination of same. When the admixture of zinc oxide,<br>
silica and alumina results in a form of the mixture which is either in a dough state<br>
or paste state, the mix can be shaped to form a paniculate granule, extrudate, tablet,<br>
sphere, pellet or mixrosphere. Presently preferred are cylindrical exrudates having<br>
from 1/32 inch to 1/2 inch diameter and any suitable length. The resulting<br>
paniculate is then dried and then calcined. When the mix is in the form of a slurry,<br>
the particulation of same is achieved by spray drying tht slurry to form<br>
microspheres thereof having a size of from about 20 to about 500 microns. Such<br>
microspheres are then subjected to drying and calcination. Following the drying<br>
and calcination of the particulated mixture, the resulting particulates can be<br>
impregnated with nickel oxide compound or a nickel oxide precursor.<br>
Following the impregnation of the paniculate compositions with the<br>
appropriate nickel compound, the resulting impregnated paniculate is then subjected<br>
to drying and calcination prior to the subjecting of the calcined paniculate to<br>
reduction with a reducing agent, preferably hydrogen.<br>
The elemental nickel, nickel oxide or nickel-containing compound<br>
can be added to the particulated mixture by impregnation of the mixture with a<br>
solution, either aqueous or organic, that contains the elemental nickel, nickel oxide<br>
or nickel-containing compound. In general, the impregnation with the nickel is<br>
carried out so as to form a resulting paniculate composition of zinc oxide, silica,<br>
alumina and the nickel metal, nickel oxide or nickel oxide precursor prior to the<br><br>
drying and calcination of the resulting impregnated composition.<br>
The impregnation solution is any aqueous solution and amounts of<br>
such solution which suitably provides for the impregnation of the mixture of zinc<br>
oxide, silica and alumina to give an amount of nickel oxide in the final zinc oxide<br>
based composition to provide when reduced a reduced nickel metal content<br>
sufficient to permit the removal of sulfur from streams of cracked-gasoline or diesel<br>
fuels when so treated with same in accordance with the process of the present<br>
invention.<br>
Once the nickel, nickel oxide or nickel oxide precursor has been<br>
incorporated into the particulate calcined zinc oxide, alumina and silica mixture, the<br>
desired reduced valence nickel metal sorbent is prepared by drying the resulting<br>
composition followed by calcination and thereafter subjecting the resulting calcined<br>
composition to reduction with a suitable reducing agent, preferably hydrogen, so as<br>
to produce a composition having a substantial zero valence nickel content therein<br>
with such zero valence nickel content being present in an amount to permit the<br>
removal with same of sulfur from a cracked-gasoline or diesel fuel fluid stream.<br>
The solid reduced nickel metal sorbent of this invention is a<br>
composition that has the ability to react with and/or chemisorb with organo-sulfur<br>
compounds, such as thiophenic compounds. It is also preferable that the sorbent<br>
removes diolefins and other gum forming compounds from the cracked-gasoline.<br>
The solid reduced metal sorbent of this invention is comprised of<br>
nickel that is in a substantially reduced valence state, preferably a zero valence state.<br>
Presently the reduced metal is nickel. The amount of reduced nickel in the solid<br>
nickel reduced metal sorbents of this invention is that amount which will permit the<br>
removal of sulfur from a cracked-gasoline or diesel fuel fluid stream. Such amounts<br>
are generally in the range of from about S to about SO weight percent of the total<br>
weight of nickel in the sorbent composition. Presently it is preferred that the<br>
reduced nickel metal be present in an amount in the range of from about 15 to<br>
about 40 weight percent of the total weight of nickel in the sorbent composition.<br>
In one presently preferred embodiment of the present invention, the<br>
reduced nickel is present in an amount in the range of from about 15 to 30 weight<br>
percent and the nickel component has been substantially reduced to zero valence.<br><br>
In another presently preferred embodiment of this invention, zinc<br>
oxide is present in an amount of about 38 weight percent, silica is present in an<br>
amount of about 31 weight percent, alumina is present in an amount of about<br>
8 weight percent and nickel is present prior to reduction to zero valence in an<br>
amount of about 30 weight percent nickel oxide.<br>
In another presently preferred embodiment of this invention, zinc<br>
oxide is present in an amount of about 41 weight percent, silica is present in an<br>
amount of about 32 weight percent, alumina is present in an amount of about<br>
8 weight percent and nickel is present prior to reduction in an amount of about<br>
19 weight percent.<br>
From the above, it can be appreciated that the sorbent compositions<br>
which are useful in the desulfurization process of this invention can be prepared by<br>
a process which comprises:<br>
(a) admixing zinc oxide, silica and alumina so as to form a mix of<br>
same in the form of one of a wet mix, dough, paste or slurry;<br>
(b) particulating the resulting mix to form particulates thereof in the<br>
form of one of granules, extrudates, tablets, pellets, spheres or microspheres;<br>
(c) drying the resulting particulate;<br>
(d) calcining the dried particulate;<br>
(e) impregnating the resulting calcined particulate with nickel, nickel<br>
oxide or a precursor for nickel;<br>
(f) drying the impregnated particulate;<br>
(g) calcining the resulting dried particulate; and<br>
(h) reducing the calcined particulate product of (g) with a suitable<br>
reducing agent so as to produce a particulate composition having a substantial<br>
reduced valence nickel content therein and wherein the reduced valence nickel<br>
content is present in an amount sufficient to permit the removal with same of sulfur<br>
from a cracked-gasoline or diesel fuel fluid stream when contacted with the<br>
resulting substantially reduced valence nickel particulated sorbent.<br>
The process to use the novel sorbents to desulfurize cracked-gasoline<br>
or diesel fuels to provide a desulfurized cracked-gasoline or diesel fuel comprises:<br>
(a) desulfurizing in a desulfurization zone a cracked-gasoline or<br><br>
diesel fuel with a solid reduced nickel metal metal-containing sorbent;<br>
(b) separating the desulfurized cracked-gasoline or desulfurized<br>
diesel fuel from the resulting sulfurized solid reduced nickel-containing sorbent;<br>
(c) regenerating at least a portion of the sulfurized solid reduced<br>
nickel-containing sorbent to produce a regenerated desulfurized solid nickel-<br>
containing sorbent;<br>
(d) reducing at least a portion of the regenerated desulfurized solid<br>
nickel-containing sorbent to produce a solid reduced nickel-containing sorbent<br>
thereafter and;<br>
(e) returning at least a portion of the regenerated solid reduced<br>
nickel-containing sorbent to the desulfurization zone.<br>
The desulfurization step (a) of the present invention is carried out<br>
under a set of conditions that includes total pressure, temperature, weight hourly<br>
space velocity and hydrogen flow. These conditions are such that the solid reduced<br>
nickel-containing sorbent can desulfurize the cracked-gasoline or diesel fuel to<br>
produce a desulfurized cracked-gasoline or desulfurized diesel fuel and a sulfurized<br>
sorbent.<br>
In carrying out the desulfurization step of the process of the present<br>
invention, it is preferred that the feed cracked-gasoline or diesel fuel be in a vapor<br>
phase. However, in the practice of the invention it is not essential, albeit preferred,<br>
that the feed be totally in a vapor or gaseous state.<br>
The total pressure can be in the range of about 15 psia to about<br>
1500 psia. However, it is presently preferred that the total pressure be in a range of<br>
from about 50 psia to about 500 psia.<br>
In general, the temperature should be sufficient to keep the cracked-<br>
gasoline or diesel fuel essentially in a vapor phase. While such temperatures can be<br>
in the range of from about 100°F to about 1000°F, it is presently preferred that the<br>
temperature be in the range of from about 400°F to about 800°F when treating as<br>
cracked-gasoline and in the range of from about 500°F to about 900°F when the<br>
feed is a diesel fuel.<br>
Weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) is defined as the pounds of<br>
hydrocarbon feed per pound of sorbent in the desulfurization zone per hour. In the<br><br>
practice of the present invention, such WHSV should be in the range of from about<br>
0.5 to about SO, preferably about 1 to about 20 hr-1.<br>
In carrying out the desulfurization step, it is presently preferred that<br>
an agent be employed which interferes with any possible chemisorbing or reacting<br>
of the olefinic and aromatic compounds in the fluids which are being treated with<br>
the solid reduced nickel-containing sorbent. Such an agent is presently preferred to<br>
be hydrogen.<br>
Hydrogen flow in the desulfurization zone is generally such that the<br>
mole ratio of hydrogen to hydrocarbon feed is the range of about 0.1 to about 10,<br>
and preferably in the range of about 0.2 to about 3.0.<br>
The desulfurization zone can be any zone wherein desulfurization of<br>
the feed cracked-gasoline or diesel fuel can take place. Examples of suitable zones<br>
are fixed bed reactors, moving bed reactors, fluidized bed reactors and transport<br>
reactors. Presently, a fluidized bed reactor or a fixed bed reactor is preferred.<br>
If desired, during the desulfurization of the vaporized fluids, diluents<br>
such as methane, carbon dioxide, flue gas, and nitrogen can be used. Thus it is not<br>
essential to the practice of the process of the present invention that a high purity<br>
hydrogen be employed in achieving the desired desulfurization of the cracked-<br>
gasoline or diesel fuel.<br>
It is presently preferred when utilizing a fluidized system that a solid<br>
reduced nickel sorbent be used that has a particle size in the range of about 20 to<br>
about 1000 micrometers. Preferably, such sorbents should have a particle size of<br>
from about 40 to about 500 micrometers. When a fixed bed system is employed for<br>
the practice of the desulfurization process of this invention, the sorbent should be<br>
such as to have a particle size in the range of about 1/32 inch to about 1/2 inch<br>
diameter.<br>
It is further presently preferred to use solid reduced nickel sorbents<br>
that have a surface area of from about 1 square meter per gram to about 1000<br>
square meters per gram of solid sorbent.<br>
The separation of the gaseous or vaporized desulfurized fluids and<br>
sulfurized sorbent can be accomplished by any means known ta the art that can<br>
separate a solid from a gas. Examples of such means are cyclonic devices, settling<br><br>
chambers or other impingement devices for separating solids and gases. The<br>
desulfurized gaseous cracked-gasoline or desulfurized diesel fuel can then be<br>
recovered and preferably liquefied.<br>
The gaseous cracked-gasoline or gaseous diesel fuel is a composition<br>
that contains in part, otefins, aromatics and sulfur-containing compounds as well as<br>
paraffins and naphthenes.<br>
The amount of olefins in gaseous cracked-gasoline is generally in the<br>
range of from about 10 to 35 weight percent based on the weight of the gaseous<br>
cracked-gasoline. For diesel fuel there is essentially no olcfin content.<br>
The amount of aromatics in gaseous cracked-gasoline is generally in<br>
the range of about 20 to about 40 weight percent based on the weight of the<br>
gaseous cracked gasoline. The amount of aromatics in gaseous diesel fuel is<br>
generally in the range of about 10 to about 90 weight percent.<br>
The amount of sulfur in cracked-gasolines or diesel fuels can range<br>
from about 100 parts per million sulfur by weight of the gaseous cracked-gasoline<br>
to about 10,000 parts per million sulfur by weight of the gaseous cracked-gasoline<br>
and from about 100 parts per million to about 50,000 parts per million for diesel<br>
fuel prior to the treatment of such fluids with the sorbent system of the present<br>
invention.<br>
The amount of sulfur in cracked-gasolines or in diesel fuels following<br>
treatment of same in accordance with the desulfurization process of this invention is<br>
less man 100 parts per million.<br>
In carrying out the process of this invention, if dqsired, a stripper unit<br>
can be inserted before the regenerator for regeneration of the sulfurized sorbent<br>
which will serve to remove a portion, preferably all, of any hydrocarbons from the<br>
sulfurized sorbent or before the hydrogen reduction zone so as to remove oxygen<br>
and sulfur dioxide from the system prior to introduction of the regenerated sorbent<br>
into the sorbent activation zone. The stripping comprises a set of conditions that<br>
includes total pressure, temperature and stripping agent partial pressure.<br>
Preferably the total pressure in a stripper, when employed, is in a<br>
range of from about 25 psia to about 500 psia.<br>
The temperature for such strippers can be in the range of from about<br><br>
100°F to about 1000°F.<br>
The stripping agent is a composition that helps to remove<br>
hydrocarbons from the sulfurized solid sorbent. Presently, the preferred stripping<br>
agent is nitrogen.<br>
The sorbent regeneration zone employs a set of conditions such that<br>
at least a portion of the sulfurized sorbent is desulfurized.<br>
The total pressure in the regeneration zone is generally in the range<br>
of from about 10 to about 1500 psia. Presently preferred is a total pressure in the<br>
range of from about 25 psia to about 500 psia.<br>
The sulfur removing agent partial pressure is generally in the range of<br>
from about 1 percent to about 25 percent of the total pressure.<br>
The sulfur removing agent is a composition that helps to generate<br>
gaseous sulfur oxygen-containing compounds such a sulfur dioxide, as well as to<br>
burn off any remaining hydrocarbon deposits that might be present. Currently,<br>
oxygen-containing gases such as air are the preferred sulfur removing agent.<br>
The temperature in the regeneration zone is generally from about<br>
100°F to about 1500°F with a temperature in the range of about 800°F to about<br>
1200°F being presently preferred.<br>
The regeneration zone can be any vessel wherein the desulfurizing or<br>
regeneration of the sulfurized sorbent can take place.<br>
The desulfurized sorbent is then reduced in an activation zone with a<br>
reducing agent so that at least a portion of the nickel content of the sorbent<br>
composition is reduced to produce a solid nickel reduced metal sorbent having an<br>
amount of reduced metal therein to permit the removal of sulfur components from a<br>
stream of cracked-gasoline or diesel fuel.<br>
In general, when practicing the process of this invention, the<br>
reduction of the desulfurized solid nickel-containing sorbent is carried out at a<br>
temperature in the range of about 100°F to about 1500°F and a pressure in the<br>
range of about 15 to 1500 psia. Such reduction is carried out for a time sufficient<br>
to achieve the desired level of nickel reduction in the sorbent system. Such<br>
reduction can generally be achieved in a period of from about 0.01 to about<br>
20 hours.<br><br>
Following the activation of the regenerated paniculate sorbent, at<br>
least a portion of the resulting activated (reduced) sorbent can be returned to the<br>
desulfurization unit.<br>
When carrying out the process of the present invention in a fixed bed<br>
system, the steps of desulfurization, regeneration, stripping, and activation are<br>
accomplished in a single zone or vessel.<br>
The desulfurized cracked-gasoline resulting from the practice of the<br>
present invention can be used in the formulation of gasoline blends to provide<br>
gasoline products suitable for commercial consumption.<br>
The desulfurized diesel fuels resulting from the practice of the present<br>
invention can likewise be used for commercial consumption where a low sulfur-<br>
containing fuel is desired.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
The following examples are intended to be illustrative of the present<br>
invention and to teach one of ordinary skill in the art to make and use the<br>
invention. These examples are not intended to limit the invention in any way.<br>
EXAMPLE I<br>
A solid reduced nickel metal sorbent was produced by dry mixing<br>
20.02 pounds of diatomite silica and 25.03 pounds of zinc oxide in a mix-Muller for<br>
15 minutes to produce a first mixture. While still mixing, a solution containing<br>
6.38 pounds of Disperal alumina (Condea), 22.5 pounds of deionized water and 316<br>
grams of glacial acetic acid, were added to the mix-Muller to produce a second<br>
mixture. After adding these components, mixing continued for an additional 30<br>
minutes. This second mixture was then dried at 300°F for 1 hour and then calcined<br>
at 1175°F for 1 hour to form a third mixture. This third mixture was then<br>
particulated by granulation using a Stokes Pennwalt Granulator fitted with a<br>
50 mesh screen. The resulting granulated mixture was then impregnated with<br>
673.8 grams of nickel nitrate hexahydrate dissolved in 20 grams of hot (200°F)<br>
deionized water per 454 grams of granulated third mixture to produce an<br>
impregnated particulate. The impregnated mixture was dried at 300°F for one hour<br>
and then calcined at 1175°F for one hour to form a solid particulate nickel oxide-<br>
containing composition.<br><br>
The solid nickel oxide-containing participate was then reduced by<br>
subjecting it to a temperature of 1000°F, a total pressure of 15 psia and a hydrogen<br>
partial pressure of 15 psi for 30 minutes to produce a solid reduced nickel sorbent<br>
wherein the nickel component of the sorbent composition was reduced substantially<br>
to zero valence.<br>
Reduction of the paniculate solid calcined composition comprising<br>
zinc oxide, silica, alumina and a nickel compound so as to obtain the desired<br>
sorbent having a reduced valence nickel content is carried out in the reactor as<br>
described in Example II. Alternatively, such reduction or activation of the<br>
paniculate composition to form the desired sorbent can be carried out in a separate<br>
activation or hydrogenation zone and subsequently transferred to the unit in which<br>
desulfurization of the feedstock is to be carried out.<br>
EXAMPLE II<br>
The paniculate solid reduced nickel sorbent as prepared in Example I<br>
was tested for its desulfurization ability as follows.<br>
A 1-inch quartz reactor tube was loaded with the indicated amounts<br>
as noted below of the sorbent of Example I. This solid nickel sorbent was placed<br>
on a frit in the middle of the reactor and subjected to reduction with hydrogen as<br>
noted in Example I. Gaseous cracked-gasoline having about 310 parts per million<br>
sulfur by weight sulfur-containing compounds based on the weight of the gaseous<br>
cracked-gasoline and having about 95 weight percent thiophenic compounds (such<br>
as for example, alkyl benzothiophenes, alkyl thiophenes, benzothiophene and<br>
thiophene) based on the weight of sulfur-containing compounds is the gaseous<br>
cracked-gasoline was pumped upwardly through the reactor. The rate was<br>
13.4 milliliters per hour. This produced sulfurized solid sorbent and desulfurized<br>
gaseous-cracked gasoline. In Run 1, no hydrogen was used during the<br>
desulfurization resulting in no reduction in its sulfur content.<br>
After Run 1, the sulfurized sorbent was subjected to desulfurizing<br>
conditions that included a temperature of 900°F, a total pressure of 15 psia and an<br>
oxygen partial pressure of 0.6 to 3.1 psi for a time period of 1-2 hours. Such<br>
conditions are hereinafter referred to as "regeneration conditions" to produce a<br>
desulfurized nickel-containing sorbent. This sorbent was then subjected to reducing<br><br>
conditions that included a temperature of 700°F, a total pressure of 15 psia and a<br>
hydrogen partial pressure of 15 psi for a time period of 0.5 hours. Such conditions<br>
are hereinafter referred to as "reducing conditions".<br>
The resulting solid reduced nickel metal sorbent composition was<br>
then used in Run 2. In this run, hydrogen was added to the cracked-gasoline feed at<br>
a partial pressure of 2.25 psi which resulted in the reduction of sulfur content from<br>
310 ppm to 30 ppm after 1 hour and 170 ppm after 4 hours.<br>
After Run 2, the sulfurized sorbent was then subjected to the<br>
desulfurizing conditions and the reducing conditions. This solid sorbent was then<br>
used in Run 3. Run 3 was a repeat of Run 2 indicating the sorbent can be<br>
regenerated.<br>
After Run 3, the sulfurized sorbent was subjected to the regeneration<br>
conditions. This regenerated sorbent was then used in Run 4. In Run 4, the sorbent<br>
was not reduced prior to the desulfurization run, resulting in a poorer removal of<br>
sulfur from the feed.<br>
After Run 4, the sulfurized sorbent was subjected to the desulfurizing<br>
conditions and the reducing conditions. This solid nickel reduced metal sorbent was<br>
then used in Run 5. In Run 5, when the hydrogen partial pressure was increased to<br>
13.2 psi, the performance of the sorbent markedly improved and a sulfur removal to<br>
5-30 ppm was observed.<br>
After Run 5, the sulfurized sorbent was subjected to the regeneration<br>
conditions and the reducing conditions. This solid reduced nickel metal sorbent was<br>
then used in Run 6. In Run 6, the temperature was raised to 700°F which improved<br>
the sulfur reduction ability of the sorbent resulting in a product that contained<br>
10 ppm or less sulfur.<br>
After Run 6, the sulfurized sorbent was subjected to the regeneration<br>
conditions and the reducing conditions. This solid reduced nickel metal sorbent was<br>
then used in Run 7 with the temperature returned to 600°F. Once again the sorbent<br>
showed ability to remove sulfur but not as efficient as at 700°F.<br>
After Run 7, the sulfurized sorbent was subjected to the regeneration<br>
conditions and the reducing conditions. This solid reduced nickel metal sorbent was<br>
then added to 5 grams of new solid reduced nickel metal sorbent and then used in<br><br>
Run 8. The reactor had a total of 10 grains of sorbent instead of 5 grams in<br>
Runs 1-7. Under these conditions, the sulfur was reduced to less than 5 ppm from<br>
gasoline.<br>
Runs 8 and 9 show the high effectiveness of the invention sorbent to<br>
reduce sulfur from cracked-gasoline to less than or equivalent to 5 ppm at two<br>
differential pressures of hydrogen and that the sorbent is regenerable.<br>
The feed employed in these runs had a Motor Octane Number<br>
(MON) of 80 and an olefin content of 24.9 weight percent. The composite MON<br>
for Run 8 was 79.6. The composite MON for Run 9 was 79.9. When compared<br>
with the MON value of the feed it can be seen that no significant loss of octane was<br>
observed. The olefin content was reduced only 10 percent as shown by a<br>
comparison of the original feed olefin content of 24.9 weight percent with Run 8<br>
product which had an olefin content of 22.4 weight percent and Run 9 product<br>
which also had an olefin content of 22.4 weight percent.<br>
The results of this series of runs is set forth in Table 1.<br><br><br>
EXAMPLE III<br>
A second solid reduced nickel metal sorbent composition was<br>
prepared as follows:<br>
363 grams of diatomite silica was mixed with 443 grams of Nyacol<br>
Al-20 alumina solution in a mix-Muller. While still mixing, 454 grams of dry zinc<br>
oxide powder was then added to the above mixture and further mixed for<br>
30 minutes to form an extrudable paste. This paste was extruded through a<br>
laboratory 1-inch Bonnet extruder employing a die containing 1/16 inch holes. The<br>
wet extrudate was dried at 300°F for one hour and calcined at 1175°F for one hour.<br>
500 grams of dried extrudate were then impregnated with a solution of 371.4 grams<br><br>
of nickel nitrate hexahydrate dissolved in 36.5 ml of deionized water, the nickel<br>
impregnates were dried at 300°F for one hour and then calcined at 1175°F for one<br>
hour. 200 grams of the first nickel impregnated sorbent was subjected to a second<br>
impregnation with 74.3 grams of nickel nitrate hexahydrate dissolved in 30 grams of<br>
deionized water. After the second impregnation, once again the impregnated<br>
extrudates were dried at 300°F for one hour and then calcined at 1175°F for one<br>
hour.<br>
The extruded solid nickel oxide sorbent was then reduced in the<br>
reactor by subjecting it to a temperature of 700°F, a total pressure of 15 psia and a<br>
hydrogen partial pressure of 15 psia for 60 minutes to produce an extruded solid<br>
reduced nickel sorbent wherein the nickel component of the sorbent composition<br>
was substantially reduced to zero valence state.<br>
EXAMPLE IV<br>
10 grams of the paniculate sorbent of Example III was placed in a<br>
1/2 inch diameter stainless steel tube having a length of about 12 inches. The<br>
bottom of the tube was packed with alundum pellets (R-268 Norton Chemical) to<br>
provide an inert support for the bed of sorbent which was placed in the middle of<br>
the reactor. Alundum was also placed on top of the sorbent bed. Gaseous diesel<br>
motor fuel having a density at 37.5°C of 0.8116 g/cc, an Initial Boiling Point of<br>
266°F and a Final Boiling Point of 725°F and having 415 ppm sulfur by weight<br>
sulfur-containing compounds based on the weight of the gaseous diesel fuel was<br>
pumped downwardly through the reactor at a WHSV of 1.0 hr-1.<br>
The reactor was maintained at a temperature of 800°F and a pressure<br>
of 150 psig. Hydrogen Flow was at 50 seem feed (standard cubic centimeters per<br>
minute).<br>
The sorbent composition was reduced with hydrogen for 1 hour<br>
before Run 1. Before Run 2, the sorbent was regenerated with air at 900°F for<br>
1 hour, then purged with nitrogen and then reduced in flowing hydrogen for 1 hour<br>
at 700°F.<br>
The product sulfur (ppm) for each run was measured at 1 hour<br>
intervals over a 4 hour period.<br>
The following results were obtained:<br><br><br>
The above data clearly demonstrate that use of the reduced nickel<br>
sorbent of this invention to remove sulfur from a diesel fuel having 415 ppm<br>
results in a significant reduction of the sulfur content-generally to below 50 ppm.<br><br>
