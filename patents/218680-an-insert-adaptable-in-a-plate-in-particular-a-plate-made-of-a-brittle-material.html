PLATES-, FOR THE PURPOSE 0F FASTENING THEM AND THE<br>
PIATES THUS EQUIPPED<br>
5 The present invention relates to plates, especially<br>
made of a brittle material of the glass type, which are<br>
equipped so as to be fastened to supports via<br>
connecting elements.<br>
10 Such plates are intended especially to equip heating<br>
means, such as radiators, convectors, etc., without,<br>
however, the present invention being limited to such an<br>
application, Thusr the fastening of double-glazing or<br>
laminated-glass plates may be mentioned, and also the<br>
15 production of walls or of furniture made of glass<br>
Substrates.<br>
These plates must therefore have holes at the fastening<br>
points- The plates may be strengthened, especially by<br>
20 thermally or chemically toughening them, in order to<br>
obtain the mechanical strength (and where appropriate<br>
the thermal resistance) that is required- The holes<br>
must then be made before the heat treatment-<br>
25 PCT International Application WO-A1-01/094 5 9 discloses<br>
a fastening element for double-glazing plates, said<br>
element consisting of a threaded bolt having, at its<br>
front end, an' expansion cone onto which a ring-shaped<br>
expansion  element  is  slipped  for  the  purpose  of<br>
30 expansion in a hole in the rear glass plate, said hole<br>
being back—tapered in the region of its bottom.<br>
Such a device has the drawback that, while the glass<br>
plates provided with holes having such back capers are<br>
35 being heat treated, high stresses are created in the<br>
region of the fillet that joins the bottom of these<br>
holes to the frustoconieal side wall emerging in the<br>
surface of the glass plate and flaring out toward "the<br><br>
-2-  <br>
Bottom of the holes. These high stresses may result in<br>
defective plates that have to be- scrapped after the<br>
heat treatment or in which, while they are being<br>
mounted or subsequent to tneir use, develop faults such<br>
5  as cracks.<br>
Another drawback of this Known arrangement is that,<br>
once the plate has been mounted, it is only with very<br>
great diffiulty that it can be- demoted, with a high<br>
10  risk of damaging or even breaking it.<br>
The present invention remedies these drawbacks and<br>
provides a fastening system comprising inserts that are<br>
intended to  receive  fasteninq elements proper,  said<br>
15 inserts being designed to be received or formed in situ<br>
in holes whose retaining side wall is of curved profile<br>
and no longer frustoconieal. Thus, for the same cavity<br>
volume as in the prior art of the aforemetioned<br>
technique, the contact or bearing area of the mount-ing<br>
20 member, that the insert constitutes, will be larger,<br>
and this allows the forces to be better distributed.<br>
For this purpose, the subject of the present invention<br>
is  an  insert  intended  to  cooperate  in  a  plate,<br>
25 especially made of a brittle material of the glass<br>
type, so as to allow, in cooperation with a connectinq<br>
element, said plate to be mounted on a support,<br>
characteried in that it is designed to be received or<br>
formed in situ in a hole having retaining walls of<br>
30 curved profiler said- hole being made in ohe face of the<br>
plate.<br>
In preerred embdiments of the invention, one or more<br>
of the folloiwing provisions may optionally also be<br>
35  employed:<br>
the hole is bounded by a side wall of concave<br>
.profile, the concavity being turned toward the inside,-<br>
the hole is a blind hols or a. throgh-hole;<br><br>
- 3 -<br>
the hole has a circular or obiong cro$$<br>
section;<br>
-  the  insert  is  obtained  from  at  least  one<br>
component made of a deforable material;<br>
5       -  the' insert is removable;<br>
the  inserc  consists of -a cup-shaped element<br>
intended to be introduced into the corresponding hole<br>
in the plate, said cup having radial slots made in its<br>
side  wall,   thus  forming  petals  that  can  bend<br>
10  elastically, or even plastically, inward so as to- allow<br>
said element to be fitted into the corresponding hole<br>
in the plate, the internal surface of the side wall of<br>
the. cupllka element being designed to corporate with<br>
the element for connecting it to the support;<br>
15       -  the cupiike element ia of circular shape;<br>
the cuplike element has three to five slots;<br>
the element- has a curved, optionally pierced,<br>
bottom;<br>
the cooperation between the connecting element<br>
20  and the insert is suit'able for self-locking said insert<br>
within the hole?<br>
a wetting agent for improving the surface<br>
appearance is: interposed at the interface between the<br>
side wall of the hole and the insert.<br>
The. present invention also reLates to. a plate,<br>
especially made of a brittle material of the glass<br>
type&gt; having on at least .one of its surfaces a hole<br>
intended to receive- at least one irisett as defined<br>
30 above:. It also relates to such a plate equipped with<br>
its insert or inserts. It alao relates to a plate which<br>
has' been equipped with its insert or inserts and the .or<br>
each insert of which has ceceived an element for<br>
connecting It. to a support.<br>
35<br>
As indicated above, the brittle material of which these<br>
plates are made is in general toughened glass, or mora<br>
generally, a glass substrate that is capable of<br>
under going a heat trearment, especially a toughening,<br><br>
- 4 -<br>
tempering or annealing treatment, or else, a glaas that<br>
is mechanically reinforced, after the holes have been<br>
produced.<br>
.5 The present invention also relates to a mounted<br>
assembly or an assembly to be mounted which comprises<br>
at least ane plate made of brittle material .of the<br>
glass type, .as defined above.<br>
10 In particular, such an assembly is a heating means<br>
comprising a glass plate as defined above, it being'<br>
possible for said plate to. be provided with conducting<br>
elements, for example screen-printed: elements, and with<br>
current leads.<br>
15<br>
Finally, the present invention relates to a process for<br>
manufaeturing a plate suitable for being mounted on a<br>
support so as to constitute a mounted assembly, such as<br>
a heating means, characterized in that the surface of.<br>
20 the plate, especially one made of a brittle material of<br>
the glass type that has not, undergone a heat treatment,<br>
is machined so as to make at least one hole at. the<br>
place of the fastening points, each forementioned hole<br>
being shaped so as to allow an insert as defined above<br>
'25 to be introduced and retained, in that a heat treatment<br>
is then carried .out on said plate, and In that an<br>
insert of Comp1 ementary shape as defined above is<br>
placed Or formed in &amp;itu in each of the holes.<br>
30 To better illustrate the subject of the present<br>
invention, one particular embodiment thereof will be<br>
described below, by way of indication but implying no<br>
limitation, with reference to the appended drawing in Which:<br>
35<br>
figure 1 is a partial view in perspective of a<br>
toughened GlaSS plate into which devices for fastienig<br>
said plate to a support have been fitted, only one of<br>
these. devices appearing in figure 1;<br><br>
- 5 -<br>
figure 2 Is an exploded oross-sectional View<br>
through the toughened glass plats of figure 1 in 3<br>
diametral plane of the fastening device shown in this<br>
figure; and<br>
5 - figure 3 is, on a larger scale, a perspective<br>
view of the insert of the fastening device £hown in<br>
figures 1 and 2;<br>
figure 4 is a perspective view of a piece of<br>
furniture mounted, by means of fastening devices that<br>
10  form the subject of the invention;<br>
figure 5 is a perspective view of a partition<br>
or of a wall provided with a hinge-, which is mounted on<br>
the wall by means of a fastening device forming the<br>
subject of the invention ,<br>
15<br>
Referring firstly to figures 1 and 2, these show a<br>
toughened glass plate 1 that is intended, for example;<br>
to constitute the external plate of a heating means,<br>
such as a wall convector,  a plinth heater,  a band<br>
20  heater or a radiant panel.<br>
According to other embodiments, one example of which,<br>
specific to furniture, is shown in figure 4, this<br>
plate, especially made of a- brittle material of the<br>
25 glass cype, may constitute a wall cladding element, an<br>
interior furnishing, a wall or partition, a piece of<br>
furniture or any other wall. Connecting elements 22,<br>
23, 24 (hinge, spacer, junction or the like, accessory<br>
support, etc.) which can be seen in figure 4 comprise,<br>
30 at One of their free ends 24, 251 26, at least One<br>
insert 8 according to the invention designed to be<br>
mounted within a hole made in said plate, the assembly<br>
for mounting the furniture being immobilized by means<br>
of the connecting elements 22, 23, 24 and the inserts 8<br>
35 that connect the components together. Of course, these<br>
connecting components may be mounted on the inside<br>
and/or on the outside of the furniture.<br>
AccordiIng to another eubodiment example shown in figure<br><br>
- 6 -<br>
5r the insert 8. forming the subject of the invention<br>
allows a hinge 21 to be mounted' on a support 1 (a (door,<br>
partition or the. like).<br>
5 Depending on the. case, the toughened glass plate -<br>
which is therefore thermally resistant and mechanically<br>
strong - is:<br>
a hotplate, for example a plate covered with a<br>
transparent electrically conductive Coating, which acts<br>
10 as a resistant element in which electricity flowing<br>
through it is converted in to heat. by the Jcuie effect,<br>
thin conductive strips placed along the vertical and/or<br>
horizontal borders constituting current lead buses for<br>
said electrically conductive coating; this coaring is,<br>
15 for example, a low-emissivity infrared-reflecive<br>
coating, such as a coating of antimony- or fluoirine-<br>
doped tin, or of tin-doped indium oxide, deposited with<br>
a thickness of a few hundred nanometers; or<br>
a plate having a. costing that reflects infred<br>
20  radiation,  said coating being of  the  type of low-<br>
emissivity coatings mentioned dbove,  or a thin metal<br>
Coating; or. else<br>
a protective plate.<br>
25 It is desired that for this external plate have<br>
fastening devices that are carried by its face turned<br>
toward ths inside in the mounted position of the<br>
apparatus, said fastening device^ therefor© being<br>
concealed from view.<br>
3O<br>
The plate 1; of rectangular (or square) shape shown in<br>
the- drawing, has a face la. which will be the face<br>
presented for view in the final assembly. Made in the<br>
corner regions of the face Ib on the opposite side from<br>
35 the face la ars identical blind holes- 2, only ons of<br>
which may be seen in Figure 2. Of course, depending on<br>
the intended applications, the holes may be tnrough-<br>
holS and circular or oblong.<br><br>
-7-<br>
Each of these holes 2 is bounded by a. flat. circuLac<br>
bottom 3 parallel to the faces la, lb of the glass<br>
plate 1 .and by a- side wall 4 joined to the bottom 3 by<br>
a retaining region 5 of curved, especially concave,<br>
5 profile, the concavity- of which is turned toward the<br>
inside of the hole 2 and has axis! symmetry, then a<br>
short cylindrical region 6 before emerging at the<br>
surface lb in an outwardly flaring frustoconical region<br>
7. The region 6 thus constitutes, with the neighboring<br>
10 parts of the regions 5 and 7, a canching or retaining<br>
bead, whose- role will be indicated later.<br>
The depth of the hole 2, at the bottom 3, corresponds<br>
for example to at (most one half of the thickness of the<br>
15  plate 1,<br>
The concave region 5 has in fact a first part 5a. having<br>
a first radius of curvature B. and constituting the<br>
start of the concavity near the bottom 3, and a second<br>
20 part 5b joining the part 5a and the cylindrical region<br>
6, and. having .a second tadlus of curvature F2 that is<br>
smaller than the first.<br>
In the example shown, the bottom 3 or a hole 2 has a<br>
25  diameter of 7.6 mm? its height is 1.5 mm and the radii<br>
of curvature R1 and R2 are 12 mm and 2 mm respectively.<br>
To make it easier to machine the hole, aspecially at<br>
the bottom of the hole, the bottom well is provided<br>
with a radius of curvature R3 of a few tenths of a<br>
30  millimerre.<br>
Introduced into each of the holes 2 is an insert 3'<br>
molded in a plastic, such as for example PVDF<br>
(polyvinylidene fluoride), or in a metallic material<br>
35 taluminum for example) . As a variant, this insert may<br>
be molded in situ. As may be more clearly seen in<br>
Figure 3, each insert 8 has a peripheral wall 3 joined<br>
to a curved bottom 10. This insert is either made as<br>
one piece or is composed of several elements- It is<br><br>
- 8 -<br>
elastically or even plastically defotmable, so as 'to<br>
allow it to be Introduced into the hole.<br>
The external face of the wall 9 is joined to the bottom<br>
5  10 by a curved region 11, the shape of which allows it<br>
to match that of the concave region 5 of the hole- 2.<br>
The curved region 11 is extended by a cylindrical wall<br>
12 of small height, which is intended to bear against<br>
the cylindrical region 6 defining the hole 2, before<br>
10  terminating,  after  an  inward  step  13,  in  another<br>
cylindrical region 14,<br>
The internal face of the wall 9 has, near the bottom<br>
10, a peripheral recess at 15, the rest of the internal<br>
15  face of the said wall 9 having an internal thread 16.<br>
Moreover, the wall 9 has-, starting from its. flat upper<br>
rim 17 - which is intended to lie, in the mounting<br>
position, in the plans or the face lb of the plate 1 -<br>
20 foyr regularly spaced and relatively deep radial slots<br>
IS extending as far as the vicinity of the bottom 10,<br>
which bottom may optionally be pierced.<br>
The side wall 9 is thus divided into four "petals* by<br>
25  these slots iS, whicii, in combination with the recess<br>
at IS, give the insert 8. flegibility, the "petals" thus<br>
being able to bend inward in order to allow, by -elastic<br>
or  even  plastic deformation,  the  insert 8  to be<br>
introduced into a hole 2; once the insert 8 has been,<br>
30  introduced, the: petals teaume that initial position,<br>
matching the regions 5 and 6 that define the hole 2.<br>
ThuS, the insert 6 is caught under the afatesmentioaned<br>
bead.  However,  a space  is  formed  in  this position<br>
between the walls 7 and 14, making it easier for the<br>
35  insett B' to bs remc-vwS should this be necessary.<br>
Depending on the- applications, and especially in- that<br>
intended in this exampler it may be important to make<br>
the hole and its insert invisible from the side facing<br><br>
- 9 -<br>
the user. For this purpose, a wetting aqent is<br>
interposed at the interface between the internal side<br>
wall of the hole and the external wall of the hola in<br>
order to improve the surface 'appearance* such as for<br>
5 example a silicone wetting agent, or a lubricating<br>
agent possessing this property.<br>
Once fitted, the insert 8 receives an element 18 for<br>
connectirtg the piare i to its support. this connecting<br>
10 element 19 ensures self-locking of the insert. The<br>
drawing shows ofly that part of the connecting element<br>
19 which coopereates with the insext 8 and is formed by<br>
A rod, the end tegion 20 of which has a screw thread 20<br>
for  fastening  tha  element  19  to  the  plate  1  by<br>
15 screwing. The opposite' end of the rod 20 (which is<br>
therefore not shown) is designed to allow connection to<br>
the chosen support.<br>
As a variant, the connecting element may consist of any<br>
20 kinematic chain for connecting a plate of brittle<br>
[material to a support. Thus, this kinumstic chain, may<br>
include a b^ll joint, optionally extencted oy a rod, an<br>
articulation, a box, etc.<br>
25  The glass plates  1  that  have undergone  a heat or<br>
chemical treatment (for example a toughening treatment}<br>
are. prepared in the following manner: the plates 1 are<br>
firstly cut from untoughened glass;  the holes 2 are<br>
machined at the intended places - in general at least:<br>
30  two, and preferably three or four holes 2 made in each<br>
corner of the plate 1, for example in- the case of the<br>
application to heating means - and then the heat or<br>
chemical treatment (in this example here, a toughening<br>
operation) is carried out on the plates 1, The concave<br>
35  region 5 of the side walls defining the holes 2 allows<br>
the stresses that develop within .the glass during the<br>
toughening treatment ta be distributed, in particular,<br>
the  profile  of  This  concave  region,  having  the<br>
aforementioned part 5a of larger radius of curvature,<br><br>
- 10 -<br>
ensures that toughening takes place without causing the<br>
glass to fracture in this region, thus avoiding having<br>
to scrap the plates 1,<br>
5  ^ext? the insette 8 are iutroduced into the respective<br>
.holes 2. (As a variant, the inserts 8 may be molded in<br>
situ). As already indicated,. this fitting of the<br>
inserts 8 is very easy because of their elasticity or<br>
even plasticity. The plates 1 may be delivered although<br>
10 theY are already equipped with their ina&amp;xts 8, which<br>
inserts do not project beyond the surface of the plates<br>
I.<br>
The  connecting  elements  19  are  then  fitted.  This<br>
15  fitting is accomplished by  screwing  in  the example<br>
shown♦<br>
A certain clearance is left between a hole 2 and the<br>
insert  8 received therein.  This allows,  on the one<br>
20 hand, easier fitting when mounting the connecting<br>
elements and, on the other hand, greater ease in<br>
absorbing the mechanical forces exerted on the plate 1<br>
once it has been mounted, which forces may increase if<br>
the plate 1 were to be a plate forming part of a<br>
25 heating means and consequently obliged to undergo<br>
expansion during heating.<br>
The   invention  as  described  above  affords  many<br>
advantages:<br>
30 - the connection between the support and: the<br>
plate requires a small number of parts;<br>
this connection is relatively insensitive  to<br>
the manufacturing toletances; and<br>
-  this connection is removable and can withstand<br>
35  relatively high mechanical forces.<br>
It will of course be understood that the embodiment<br>
described above is in no way limiting and may give rice^<br>
to any desirable modification without thereby departing<br><br>
- 11 -<br>
from the scope. of the invention.<br><br>
