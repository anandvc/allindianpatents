				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a new cytotoxic protein (M toxin, mucous layer<br>
devastating toxin) produced by Helicobacter pylori and the use.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br><br>
It has been considered that the human gets many gastritis, gastric ulcer and<br>
gastric cancer by Helicobacter pylori. A distinct direct cytotoxic factor causing<br>
destruction of gastric epithelial cells and irreversible cell death at the beginning<br><br>
of these diseases has not been specified. A factor changing pH environment "and<br>
immunity reaction in the stomach, a factor adhering to gastric epithelial cells by<br>
Helicobacter pylori, or move properties of bacteria themselves has been indicted<br>
as a factor developing such diseases. However, it has been unclear hitherto that<br>
gastric mucosal destruction triggering gastritis, gastric ulcer and gastric cancer<br>
is injured in any process, or what is a direct responsible factor to the gastric<br>
mucosal destruction. The only is that vacuolating toxin having cytotoxicity is<br>
isolated, but it has weak cytotoxic activity and reversible cytotoxic activity. As a<br>
fatal cytotoxic factor of a pathogenic factor, it has not been found in vivo and in<br>
vitro.<br>
Many researchers estimate that Helicobacter pylori, as described in the above,<br>
in the environment stomach in vivo, secretes a direct cytotoxic factor for gastric<br>
mucosal cells. Considering the importance of diseases, all sequences of the gene<br>
is confirmed in 1996. However, in spite of the use of serum, it is impossible to<br>
isolate and identify the presumable toxin due to separation conditions, with<br>
difficult culture conditions and purification conditions and unfixed valuation<br>
systems of the toxin.<br>
Problems to be solved by the invention<br>
One problem is that responsible protein causing gastritis, gastric, gastric ulcer<br>
and gastric cancer by Helicobacter pylori infection is found, a mass production<br>
method of the toxic protein is established, new M toxin is identified, and<br>
diagnosis and screening method is established. Using these methods, it is<br>
desired that responsible toxin of a cytotoxic factor for gastric mucosal cells is<br>
controlled, and preventive and treating agents of gastritis, gastric ulcer, gastric cancer<br>
and the like are developed and a method for using the toxin is found.<br>
Disclosure of the Invention<br>
Inventors of this invention have studied earnestly to resolve the above-<br>
mentioned problem, and identified a new toxin that causes irreversible cell<br>
death when Helicobacter pylori is cultured under serum-free conditions that is<br>
similar to environment in the stomach different from usual. It has been found<br>
that this toxin has a toxic power 1000 to 100000 times per unit of above-<br>
mentioned vacuolating toxin, and it causes irreversible cell death for various<br>
warm-blooded animal cells comprising not only gastric epithelial cells but also<br>
immunocytes. The inventors of this invention have repeatedly researched on<br>

Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
The protein having the same amino acid sequence or substantially identical<br>
amino acid sequence with the amino acid sequence represented by SEQ ID<br>
No. 1 of this invention may be a protein originating from bacteria strains of<br>
Helicobacter pylori, for example, NCTC 11637, NCTC 11916, DT 61A, NCTC<br>
11639, R85-13 6P, R85-13-12F, R85-13-11P, T81213-NTB, J99, 4, U2-1, 85D08,<br>
MC903, MC123, Tx30a, 26695, UA1182 and the like, or my be a synthesized<br>
protein.<br>
As substantially the same amino acid sequence as the amino acid sequence<br>
represented by SEQ ID No. 1, amino acid sequences having homology of about<br>
70% or more, preferably about 80 % or more, more preferably about 90% or<br>
more, further more preferably about 95% or more can be exemplified. As a<br>
protein having substantially the same amino acid sequence as the amino acid<br>
sequence represented by SEQ ID No.l, a protein having substantially the<br>
same amino acid sequence and substantially the same activity as that of the<br>
protein having the amino acid sequence represented by SEQ ID No. 1 can be<br>
exemplified. As substantially the same activity, a cell multiplication<br>
inhibition activity, a cytotoxic activity or an activity causing cell death can be<br>
exemplified. The term of substantially the same means that these activities<br>
have tha same quality, for example, in physiological chemistry or<br>
pharmacology. Accordingly, it is preferred that the activity of cytotoxin and<br>
the like has the same quality, for example, about 0.1-100 times, preferably<br>
about 0.5-10 times, more preferably about 0.5-2 times. The degree of these<br>
activities or quantity factors of molecular weights of proteins may be different.<br>
The activities of a cell multiplication inhibition activity, a cytotoxic activity or<br>
an activity causing cell death can be determined by well-known methods, for<br>
example, by the screening method undermentioned.<br>
As the protein of this invention, the following proteins can be exemplified:<br>
an amino acid sequence deleting 1-150 (preferably 1-50) amino acids in the<br>
amino acid sequence represented by SEQ ID No.l; an amino acid sequence<br>
adding 1-100 (preferably 1-30) amino acids in the amino acid sequence<br>
represented by SEQ ID No. 1; an amino acid sequence inserting 1-50<br>
(preferably 1-30) amino acids in the amino acid sequence represented by SEQ<br>
ID No. 1; an amino acid sequence that 1-50 (preferably 1-30) amino acids in<br>
the amino acid sequence represented by SEQ ID No. 1 are substituted by the<br>
other amino acids; or a protein containing a combination of these amino acid<br>
sequences, what is called mucin.<br>
When an amino acid sequence is iserted, deleted or substituted as described<br>
in the above, the position of insertion, deletion or substitution is not<br>
specifically limited.<br>
In the protein of this specification, according to a usual practice, the left side<br>
is an N end (an amino end) and the right side is a C end (a carboxyl end). In<br>
the proteins of this invention, which comprises the protein having the amino<br>
acid sequence represented by SEQ ID No.l, the C end is usually a carboxyl<br>
group (-COOH) or a carboxylate (-COO-), but it may be an amid (-CONH2) or<br>
an ester group (-COOR), wherein R is a C1-6 alkyl group of methyl, ethyl, n-<br>
propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl and the like, a C3-8 cycloalkyl group of cyclopentyl,<br>
cyclohexyl and the like, a C6-12 aryl group of phenyl, a-naphthyl and the like,<br>
benzyl, phenetyl and the like, a phenyl-C1-2 alkyl group of benzyl, phenetyl<br>
and the like, or a C7-14 aralkyl group of an a-naphthyl-C1-2 alkyl group of a-<br>
naphthylmethyl and the like. When the protein of this invention has a<br>
carboxyl group (or carboxylate) at a position other than the C end, proteins<br>
having an amidic or esterified group are contained in the protein of this<br>
invention. As the ester, the ester of the above-mentioned C end may be used.<br>
In the proteins of this invention, further, there is a protein that the amino<br>
group of an amino acid residue (for example, a methionin residue) at the N<br>
end is protected by a protective group (for example, a C1-6 acyl group of a C1-6<br>
alkanoyl group or the like of a formyl group, acetyl group or the like); a protein<br>
that the glutamic acid residue of the N end produced by incision in vivo is<br>
changed into pyrroglutamic acid group; a protein that the substituent group<br>
on the side chain of an amino acid in the molecular (for example, -OH, -SH, an<br>
amino group, an imidazole group, an indol group, a guanidino group or the<br>
like) is protected by a suitable protective group ( for example, a C1-6 acyl group<br>
or the like of C1-6 alkanoyl group or the like of a formyl group); or a conjugated<br>
protein or the like of so-called glycoproteins that the sugar chain is bound.<br>
As the partial pepti.de of the protein of this invention, it may be a partial<br>
pepti.de of the above-mentioend proteins of this invention, and preferably, it<br>
has similar activitieas for example, a cell multiplication inhibition activity, a<br>
cytotoxic activity or the like) to the proteins of this invention. As an example,<br>
a peptide of an amino acid sequence having at least 20% or more, preferably<br>
50% or more, more preferably 70% or more, further preferably 90% or more,<br>
and most preferably 95% or more in the amino acid sequence of this invention,<br>
and having a cell multiplication inhibition activity, a cytotoxic activity or an<br>
activity causing cell death can be utilized. The partial pepti.de of this<br>
invention may be the following peptides: 1-5 (prederably 1-3) amino acids are<br>
deleted in the amino acid sequence; 1-10 (preferably 1-5 (more preferably 1-3))<br>
amino acids added to the amino acid sequence; 1-5 (preferably 1-3) amino<br>
acids are inserted into the amino acid sequence; or 1-5 (preferably 1-3) amino<br>
acids are substituted by the other amino acids.<br>
Although the partial peptide of this invention has usually a carboxyl group<br>
(-COOH) or carboxylate (-COO-) at the C end, as shown in the above proteins<br>
of this invention, the C end may be amide (-CONH2) or ester (COOR) wherein<br>
R is the same meaning as shown in the above. In the partial peptide of this<br>
invention, further, as shown in the above proteins of this invention, there is a<br>
peptide that the amino group of an amino acid residue (for example, a<br>
methionin residue) at the N end is protected by a protective group; a protein<br>
that the glutamic acid residue of the N end produced by incision in vivo is<br>
changed into pyrroglutamic acid group; a protein that the substituent group<br>
on the side chain of an amino acid in the molecular is protected by a suitable<br>
protective group; or a conjugated protein or the like of so-called glycoproteins<br>
that the sugar chain is bound. The partial peptide of this invention can be<br>
used as an antigen for constructing an antibody, so that a cell multiplication<br>
inhibition activity, a cytotoxic activity or the like is no necessarily required.<br>
As the salt of the protein or partial peptide of this invention, salts of<br>
physiologically allowable acids (for example, inorganic acids or organic acids)<br>
or bases (for example, alkali metal salts) can be used, and preferably<br>
physiologically allowable acid addition salts, can be used. As such salts, for<br>
example, there are salts of inorganic acids (for example, hydrochloric acid,<br>
phosphoric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid), organic acids (for example,<br>
acetic acid, formic acid, propionic acid, fumaric acid, maleic acid, succinic acid,<br>
tartaric acid, citric acid, malic acid, oxalic acid, benzoic acid, methane sulfonic<br>
acid, benzene sulfonic acid). The proteins and the salts of this invention can<br>
be produced by well-known preparation methods of proteins from any kinds of<br>
strains of above-mentioned Helicobacter pylori, or by culturing a transformant<br>
containing DNA that after-mentioned protein is coded. They further can be<br>
produced in accordance with after-mentioned method for syntheizing peptides.<br>
When the proteins are produced from any kinds of strains of Helicobacter<br>
pylori, proteins in bacterial cells are centrifuged off by ultrsonic crushing,<br>
then they are extracted by ammonium sulfate precipitation or the Like, and<br>
the extracted liquid is purified and separated by combined chromatography<br>
such as ion exchange chromatography and hydrophobic chromatography.<br>
In the synthesis of the protein, the partial peptide, salts thereof or amide<br>
thereof of this invention, commertially available resins for synthesizing<br>
proteins can be used. As such resins, the following resins can be exemplified:<br>
chloromethyl resin, hydroxymethyl resin, benzhydrylamine resin,<br>
aminomethyl resin, 4-benzyloxybenzylalcohol resin, 4-methylbenzhydryl-<br>
amine resin, PAM resin, 4-hydroxymethylmethylphenylacetoamidemethyl<br>
resin, polyacrylamide resin, 4-(2",4"-dimethoxyphenylhydroxymethyl)phenoxy<br>
resin, 4-(2",4"-dimethoxyphenyl-Fmoc aminoethyl) phenoxy resin. Using such<br>
resins, an amino acid that a-amino groups and functional groups of side<br>
chains are suitably protected is condensed on the resin to meet to the desired<br>
protein sequence by a well-known condensation method. At the end of<br>
reaction, the protein is cut off from the resin and several protecting groups are<br>
deleted. Then, the desired proteins or amides thereof are obtained by a<br>
method for forming internal disulfide bonds in a high dilution solution.<br>
Concerning the above-mentioned condensation of protected amino acids,<br>
several kinds of activated agents for protein synthesis can be used, and<br>
particularly, carbodiimides can be used. As such carbodiimides, DCC, N,N"-<br>
diisopropylcarbodiimide, N-ethyl-N"-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide<br>
and the like can be used. In activation by these carbodiimides, the protected<br>
amino acid can be directly added to the resin with an additional agent for<br><br>
controlling racemization (for example, HOBt or HOOBt), or it can be added to<br>
the resin after previous activation of the protected amino acid as a symmetric<br>
acid anhydride or, HOBt ester or HOOBt ester.<br>
As the solvent used in the activation of the protected amino acid or the<br>
condensation with the resin, it can be selected from known solvents usable for<br>
the protein condensation reaction. As such solvent, acid amides such as<br>
N,N-dimethylformamide, N,N-dimethylacetoamide and N-methylpyrolidone,<br>
halogenated hydrocarbons such as methylene chloride and chloroform,<br>
alcohols such as trifuloroethanol, sulfoxydes such as dimethylsulfoxide,<br>
pyridine, eters such as dioxane and tetrahydrofuran, nitriles such as<br>
acetonitrile and propionitrile, esters such as methyl acetate and ethyl acetate,<br>
and mixtures thereof can be used. The reaction temperature is suitably<br>
selected from the known ranges that can be used in the reaction for forming<br>
protein bonds, and usually, it is suitably selected from -20 oC ~ 50 °C.<br>
Activeted amino acid derivatives are usually used by 1.5-4 times of the mole<br>
equivalent. As a test result of ninhydrin reaction, when the condensation is<br>
insufficient, the condensation reactions can be repeated without the deletion<br>
of the protected groups to conduct sufficient condensation. When sufficient<br>
condensation can not be conducted by the repeated reactions, unreacted<br>
amino acids are acetylated with acetic anhydride or acetyiimidazole, so that<br>
subsequent reactions have no influence.<br>
As the protected groups of amino groups of starting materials, for example,<br>
Z , Boc, t-pentyloxycarbonyl, isobornyloxycarbonyl, 4-methoxybenzyloxy-<br>
carbonyl, Cl-Z, Br-Z, adamantyloxycarbonyl, trifluoroacetyl, phthaloyl, formyl,<br>
2-nitrophenylsulfenyl, diphenylphosphinothioyl, Fmoc and the like can be<br>
used. The carboxyl groups can be protected, for example, by alkyl-<br>
esterification (for example, alkylesteration of straight, branched or cyclic<br>
chains of methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, t-butyl, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl,<br>
cycloheptyl, cyclooctyl and 2-adamantyl), aralkylesteration (for example,<br><br>
benzylester, 4-nitrobenzylester, 4-methoxybenzylester, 4-chlorobenzylester,<br>
benzhydrylester), phenacylesteration, benzyloxycarbonylliydxadidation, t-<br>
butoxycarbonylhydradidation, tritylhydradidation and the like. The hydroxyl<br>
group of serine can be prtected, for example, by esterification or etheration. As<br>
the suitable groups of this esterification, for example, lower (C1-6) alkanoyl<br>
groups such as an acetyl group, an acyl group such as a benzoyl group, or<br>
groups derived from carbonate such as a benzyloxycarbonyl group and<br>
ethoxycarbonyl group can be used. As groups suitable to the etheration, a<br>
benzyl group, a tetrahydropyranyl group and a t-butyl group can be<br>
exemplified. As the protected groups of phenolic hydroxyl groups of tyrosine,<br>
for examle, Bzl, C12-Bzl, 2-nitrobenzyl, Br-Z and t-butyl can be used. As the<br>
protected groups of imidazole of histidine, for example, Tos, 4-methoxy-2,3,6-<br>
trimethylbenzenesulfonyl, DNP, benzyloxymethyl, Bum, Boc, Trt and Fmoc<br>
can be used.<br>
As the activated carboxyl groups of starting materials, for example,<br>
corresponding acid anhydrides, azides and activated esters (esters of alcohol<br>
(for example, pentachlorophenol, 2,4,5-trichlorophenol, 2,4-dinitrophenol,<br>
cyanomethylalcohol, paranitrophenol, HONB, N-hydroxysucrimide, N-<br>
hydroxyphthalimide and HOBt)) can be used. As the activated amino groups<br>
of starting materials, for example, corresponding phosphoric amides can be<br>
used. As a method for removing (elimination) of the protected groups, for<br>
example, catalytic reduction in hydrogen stream in the presence of a catalyst<br>
of Pd-black or Pd-charcoal; acid treatment with anhydrous hydrogen fluoride,<br>
methan sulfonic acid, trifluoromethan sulfonic acid, trfluoroacetic acid or their<br>
mixtures; base treatment with diisopropylethylamine, triethylamine,<br>
piperidine, piperadine or the hke; or reduction with sodium in liquid ammonia<br>
can be used. The elimination reaction by using the above acid treatment is<br>
conducted usually at a temperature of— 20°C~40°C. In the acid treatment,<br>
it is efficient to add a cation catching agent such as anisol, phenol, thioanisol,<br><br>
metacresol, paracresol, dimethylsulfide, 1,4-butandithiol or 1,2-ethandithiol.<br>
The 2,4-dinitrophenyl group used as an imidazole protection group of histidine<br>
is removed by thiophenol treatment. The formyl group used as an indole<br>
protection group of tryptophan is removed by acid treatment in the presence<br>
of the above 1,2-ethanedithiol, 1,4-butanedithiol or the like, and further it can<br>
be removed by alkali treatment with a diluted sodium hydroxide solution,<br>
diluted ammmonia or the like.<br>

reaction of starting materials and the protected groups, elimination of the<br>
protected groups, activation of the functional group that participate in the<br>
reaction or the like can be suitablly selected from well-known groups and<br>
means. As the other methods for obtaining amides of proteins, for example,<br>
an a -carboxyl group of carboxy end-group amino acid is protected by<br>
amidation, a peptide chair (protein) is elongated to the desired chain length at<br>
the side of the amino chain, a protein that the protected group of the a -amino<br>
group at the N-end of the peptide chain is eliminated and a protein that the<br>
protected group of the carboxyl group at the C-end of the peptide are produced,<br>
and the both peptide are condensed in a mixture solution as described above.<br>
The particular of the condensation reaction is as mentioned in the above.<br>
The protected protein obtained by the condensation is purified, all protected<br>
groups are removed by the above method, and crude protein can be obtained.<br>
The crude protein is purified by using a known purification means, main<br>
fractions are lyophilized and an desired amide of the protein can be obtained.<br>
For obtaining esters of the protein, for example, a. -carboxyl groups of<br>
carboxy-end amino acids are condensed with desired alcohols to obtain amino<br>
acid esters, the esters are treated as shown in amides of the protein, and<br>
desired esters of the protein can be obtained.<br>

synthesis method can be used. Namely, a partial peptide able to constitute<br>
the partial peptide of this invention or an amino acid is condensed with the<br>
remaining parts, when the product has a protected group, the protected group<br>
is eliminated, and the desired peptide can be produced.<br>
As well-known condensation methods and the elimination of the protected<br>
groups, for example, the following methods are exemplified. M.Bodanszky and<br>

magnesium chloride can be exemplified. Yeast extract, vitamines, growth-<br>
stimulating materials or the like can be added. About pH 5-8 of the medium<br>
is preferrably used.<br>
As the medium for culturing Genus Escherichia, for example, a M9 medium<br>
containing glucose and casamino acid (Miller, Journal of Experiments in<br>
Molecular Genetics, 431-433, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, New York<br>

host is Genus Escherichia, the culture is usually concducted at a temperature<br>
of about 15~43oC for about 3 ~24 hours, if necessary, aeration or stirring<br>

is usually conducted at a temperature of about 20~35°C for about 24~72<br>
hours, if necessary, aeration or stirring can be added. When the<br>
transformant that the host is an insect cell or an insect is cultured, as the<br>

used by suitably adding an addition of immobilized 10% bovine serum or the<br>
like. About pH 6.2-5.4 of the medium is preferrably used. The culture is<br>
usually conducted at a temperature of about 27°C for about 3~5 days, if<br>

a D M E M medium (Virology, Vol.8, 396(1959)), an RPMI1640 medium (The<br><br>
Jounal of the American Medical Association, Vol.199, 519(1967)) , a 199<br>
medium (Proceeding of the Society for the Biological Medicine,<br>
Vol.73,1(1950)) or the like can be used. About pH 6-8 of the medium is<br>
preferrably used. The culture is usually conducted at a temperature of about<br>
30~40°C for about 15~60 hours, if necessary, aeration or stirring can be<br>

produced out of the cells of the transformants.<br>
For separation and purification of the protein of theis invention, for example,<br>
the following methods can be suitably used. When the protein of this<br>
invention is extracted from the cultured fungi or cells, after the culture, the<br>
fungi or cells are collected by a well-known method, suspended in a suitable<br>
buffer, and destroyed by ultrasound, lysozyme and/or freze-thawing or the like.<br>
Then, the crude extracted liquid of the protein is obtained by centrifugation or<br>
filtration. A protein denaturant such as urea or guanidine hydrochloride, or<br>
a surface-active agent such as tritonX-100TM can be contained in the buffer.<br>
When the protein is secreted in the medium liquid, after the culture is<br>
finished, the fungi or cells and supernatant are separated by a well-known<br>
method, and the supernatant is collected. Such obtained culture<br>
supernatant or the protein contained in the extracted liquid is purified by a<br>
combination of well-known separation and purification methods. These<br>
well-known separation and purification methods are methods using salting-<br>
out techniques or solubilities by a solvent precipitation method, a dialysis<br>
method, a method using a difference in the molecuar weight such as<br>
ultrafiltration and SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis or the like, a<br>
method using a difference of the charge such as ion exchange chromatography,<br>
a method using a difference of hydrophobic such as hydrophobic<br>
chromatography, a method using specific affinity such as afinity<br>
chromatography, a method using a difference of hydrophobic such as reverse<br>
phase high-speed liquid chromatography, a method using a difference of<br><br>
isoelectric points such as isoelectrcophoresis can be used.<br>
When such a protein is obtained in the form of free, it can be converted into<br>
a salt by a well-known method or a similar method. On the other hand,<br>
when the protein is obtained in the form of a salt, it can be converted into a<br>
free form or the other salt by a well-known method or a similar method. The<br>
protein produced by a recombinant may be further reacted with a suitable<br>
protein modification enzyme before or after purifying the protein to optionally<br>
modify or partially remove the polypeptide. As the protein modification<br>
enzyme, for example, trypsin, chymotrypsin, arginylendopeptidase, protein<br>
kinase, glycosidase or the like may be used. The activitis of such obtained<br>
protein of this invention or salts thereof may be determined by a bond<br>
experiment with a labeled ligand and enzyme immunoassay using a specific<br>
antibody or the like.<br>
The antibodies for the protein, the partial peptide or the salts of this<br>
invention, may be a polyclonal antibody or monoclonal antibody on condition<br>
that the antibodies can recognize the protein, the partial peptide and the salts.<br>
The antibodies for the protein, the partial peptide or the salts of this invention<br>
(in the following description of antibodies, these protein and the like may be<br>
abbreviated as the protein of this invention) may be produced by using the<br>
protein as the antigen and by a well-known production method of antibodies<br>
or anti-serum.<br>
Production of a monoclonal antibody <br>
(a) Production of cells of monoclonal antibody production: The protein of this<br>
invention is administered to a warm-blodded animal at a position, which can<br>
produce an antibody by the administration, with itself or a carrier or a diluent.<br>
In the administration, to enhance the effect of antibody production, a complete<br>
Freund"s adjuvant or an incomplete Freund"s adjuvant may be administered.<br>
The administration is usually conducted once for each 2 ~ 6 weeks, and<br>
total is 2 ~10 times. The warm-blooded animals are, for example, monkeys,<br><br>
rabbits, dogs, guinea pigs, mice, rats, sheep, goats, chickens and the like,<br>
preferably mice and rats. At the production of cells for producing a<br>
monoclonal antibody, the warm-blooded animal immunized with an antigen,<br>
for example, mice are used. A mouse recognizable an antibody value is<br>
selected from the mice, the spleen or the lymph is collected after 2~5 days of<br>
the final immunization, and the cells of monoclonal antibody production<br>
contained in the spleen or the lymph are fused with myeloma cells of the same<br>
kind or different kind of animals to prepare a hybridoma for producing a<br>
monoclonal antibody. The antibody value in the antiserum may be<br>
determined, for example, by a method that the antiserum is reacted with an<br>
after-mentioned labeled protein, and the activity of the labeled agent bound to<br>
the antibody is measured. The fusion operation may be conducted by a<br>
known method such as a method of Kohler and Milstein (Nature, 256, 495<br>
(1975)). As the fusion promotion agent, for example, polyethylene glycol<br>
(PEG), a Sendai virus or the like, preferably PEG may be used.<br>
As the myeloma, for example, myloma celles of warm-blooded animals such<br>
as NS-1, P3U1, SP2/0, AP-1 and AP-1, preferably P3U1 can be exemplified.<br>
The preferabl ratio of the number of the antibody production cells (spleen<br>
cells) to the number of myeloma cells is around 1:1 ~20:1. PEG (preferably,<br>
PEG1000-PEG6000) is added in the concentration of around 10~80%, and<br>
incubation is conducted at a temperature of 20~40°C, preferably 30~37°C for<br>
1 ~ 10 minutes, and cell fusion is efficiently performed. In screening of a<br>
hybridoma of monoclonal antibody production, several kinds of methods can<br>
be used, for example, there are a method that a supernatant of hyblidoma<br>
culture is added to a solid phase (such as a micro plate) adsorbing a protein<br>
antigen directly or with a carrier, and an anti-immunoglobulin antibody,<br>
which is labeled with a radioactive material or an enzyme yeast, (when the<br>
cells for using in cell fusion is a mouse, an anti-mouse immunoglobulin is<br>
used) or a protein A is added so as to detect the monoclonal antibody bound to<br><br>
the solid phase; and a method that a supernatant of hyblidoma culture is<br>
added to a solid phase adsorbing an anti-immunoglobulin antibody or a<br>
protein A, a protein labeling a radioactive material or an enzyme yeast is<br>
added, and the monoclonal antibody bound to the solid phase is detected. The<br>
selection of the monoclonal antibody may be conducted by a known method or<br>
a similar method thereof. Usually, it may be conducted by a medium for<br>
animal cells that HAT (hypoxanthine, amino pterin, thymidine) is added. As<br>
the medium for selection and breeding, any medium that the hyblidoma can<br>
breed may be used. As an example, a RPMI 1640 medium containing 1 ~<br>
20%, preferably 10~20% bovine fetus serum, a GIT medium containing 1<br>
~10% bovine fetus serum (produced by Wako Junyaku Kougyou Co.) or a<br>
medium not containing serum for hybridoma culture (SFM-101, Nissui<br>
Seiyaku Co.) may be used. The culture temperature is usually 20~40°C,<br>
preferably about 37°C. The culture time is usually 5 days ~ 3 weeks,<br>
preferably 1 week~ 2 weeks. The culture may be usually conducted in a 5 %<br>
carbon dioxide. The antibody value of the supernatant of hyblidoma culture<br>
can be determined as shown in the above-mentioned method for measuring<br>
the antibody value in the antiserum.<br>
(b) Purification of the monoclonal antibody: The separation and purification of<br>
the monoclonal antibody may be conducted by a known method, for example, a<br>
separation and purification method for immunogloblins (such as a salting-out<br>
method, an alcohol precipitation method, a isoelectric precipitation method,<br>
an electrophoresis method, a adsorption and desorption method with an ion-<br>
exchanger (for example, DEAE), a ultracentrifuge method, a gel filtration<br>
method, or a specific purification method that only an antibody is cllected with<br>
an active absorbant such as an antigen-binding solid phase or protein A or<br>
protein G, and the bond is released to obtain the antibody).<br>
(Production of the polyclonal antibody)<br>
The polyclonal antibody of this invention can be produced by a known<br><br>
method or a similar method. As an example, using an immunoanigen<br>
(protein antigen) itself or a complex of the immunoantigen and a carrier<br>
protein, it immunizes to a warm-blooded animal by using the same method as<br>
in the above-mentioed method for producing a monoclonal antibody, materials<br>
containing the antibody for the protein of this invention are collected, and the<br>
antibody is separated and purified. As to the complex of an immunoantigen<br>
for immunizing a warm-blooded animal and a carrier protein, the kind of the<br>
carrier protein and a mixture ratio of the carrier to a hap ten are not important,<br>
on condition that the antibody can be efficiently produced for the hap ten<br>
immunized by closslinking with the carrier. For example, the bovine serum<br>
albumin, bovine cyclogloblin, hemocyanin or the like can be used for coupling<br>
with the hapten at a weight ratio of about 0.1~20, preferably about 1~5 to 1<br>
of hapten. In the coupling of the hapten and the carrier, several kinds of<br>
condensation agents such as active ester agents containing glutaraldehyde,<br>
carbodiimide, maleimid active ester, a thiol group and a dithiopyridyl group<br>
can be used. The products from the condensation are administered to the<br>
parts of warm-blooded animals able to produce the antibody, along with itself<br>
or a carrier or a diluent. To enhance the ability of antibody production at the<br>
administration, a complete Freund"s adjuvant or incomplete Freund"s<br>
adjuvant may be administered. The administration is usually conducted<br>
once for every 2 ~ 6 weeks, and total is about 3 ~10 times. The polyclonal<br>
antibody can be collected from blood, ascites, preferably blood of the warm-<br>
blooded animal immunized by the above method. The polyclonal antibody<br>
value in the antiserum is determined by the same method described in the<br>
above determination of the antibody value in the antiserum. The separation<br>
and purification of the polyclonal antibody can be conducted by the same<br>
method of separation and purification of immunogloblin as in that of the<br>
above separation and purification of the monoclonal antibody.<br>
The treating agents containing the protein or the partial peptide of this<br><br>
invention and the protein of this invention and the like have cancer cytotoxic<br>
activity, so that the agents may be used as agents for extracting disease<br>
tissues (the extract contains all and partial, preferably partial extract), and<br>
particularly, for treating fixed cancer. When the protein of this invention and<br>
the like is used as the above treating and preventing agents, it is used after it<br>
is purified to at least 90%, preferably 95% or more, more preferably 98% or<br>
more, and further preferably 99% or more.<br>
The inhibition activity of cancer cell proliferation of the protein of this<br>
invention or the like can be determined by a known method, or a cytotoxin<br>
activity or an activity causing cell death is determined by known method or a<br>
similar method, preferably by the method described in the after-mentioed<br>
experiments. As the test compounds, for example, peptides, proteins, non-<br>
pepti.de compounds, synthetic compounds, fermentation products, cell extract,<br>
plant extract, animal tissue extract and blood plasma can be exemplified.<br>
These compounds may be new compounds or known compounds.<br>
The compounds or the salts obtained by the screening method or the kit for<br>
screening of this invention are selected from the above test compounds, for<br>
example, peptides, proteins, non-pepti.de compounds, synthetic compounds,<br>
fermentation products, cell extract, plant extract, animal tissue extract and<br>
blood plasma. These compounds have an activity inhibiting the cytotoxic<br>
activity of the protein of this invention or the like or the inhibition activity of<br>
cancer cell proliferation of the protein of this invention or the like. As the<br>
salts of the compounds, the salts similar to the salts of the protein of this<br>
invention can be used.<br>
When the compounds obtained by using the screening method or the kit for<br>
screening are used as the above treating agents, they can be used by usual<br>
means. For example, they are used as tablets, capsules, elixirs,<br>
microcapsules, sterile solutions, suspension or the like. As such obtained<br>
pharmaceutical preparations are safety and have low toxicity, for example,<br>
they may be administered to a human or a warm-blooded animal (such as<br>
mice, rats, rabbits, goats, pigs, cows, horses, birds, cats, dogs, monkeys and<br>
the like). The dosage weights of the compounds or salts thereof are changed<br>
by the action, the disease, the dosage route or the like. Commonly, in<br>
adults (estimated at 60 kg weight), about 0.1~100mg of the compound per<br>
day, preferably about 1.0~50mg, more preferbly about 1.0~20mg can be<br>
administered. In parenteral administration, the dosage of the compounds<br>
that is variable by the object, the disease and the like, usually in adults<br>
(estimated at 60 kg weight), is suitably about 0.01~30mg of the compound<br>
per day, more preferably about 0.1~20mg, further preferably about 0.1~<br>
10mg by intravenous injection. In the other animals, the dosage of the<br>
weight estimated at 60kg can be used.<br>
Screening of the candidate compounds of medicine for diseases: Since the<br>
protein or the like of this invention have a cytotoxic activity, the compounds or<br>
the salts promoting the function (such as a cytotoxic activity) of the protein or<br>
the like of this invention, for example, may be used as agents for treating<br>
cancers. On the other hand, the salts inhibiting the function of the protein or<br>
the like of this invention, for example, may be used as agents for treating and<br>
preventing gastritis and gastric ulcer. Accordingly, the protein or the like of<br>
this invention are effectively used as reagents for screening the compounds or<br>
the salts that promote or inhibit the function of the protein or the like of this<br>
invention.<br>
Namely, this invention provides (1) a screening method characterized in<br>
that the protein or the partial peptide or the salts of this invention are used,<br>
and the method screens the compounds promoting the function (such as a<br>
cytotoxic activity) of the protein or the partial peptide or the salts of this<br>
invention, or the method screens the compounds inhibiting the function (such<br>
as a cytotoxic activity) of the protein or the partial peptide or the salts of this<br>
invention. The compounds promoting the function may be abbriviated as<br>
"promoters" and the compounds inhibiting the function is abbreviated as<br>
"inhibitors" hereinafter.<br>
Moreover, this invention provides (2) a kit for screening promoters or<br>
inhibitors, characterized in that the protein or the prtial peptide or the salts of<br>
this invention are contained. The above kit may be abbreviated as "a kit for<br>
screening of this invention" hereinafter.<br>
In embodiment, for example, in the above (1), it provides a screening i<br>
method of promoters or inhibitors, characterixed in that comparison is<br>
conducted between case (i) and case (ii). The case (i) is that the protein or the<br>
partial peptide or the salts of this invention are contacted with a cell, which is<br>
a normal cell containing a blood cell derived from a tissue of the above warm-<br>
blooded animals (preferably human) or the above-mentioned cancer cell. The<br>
case (ii) is that the protein or the partial peptide or the salts of this invention<br>
are contacted with a cell, which is a normal cell containing a blood cell derived<br>
from a tissue of the above warm-blooded animals (preferably human) or the<br>
above-mentioned cancer cell, and a test compound.<br>
In embodiment, further, in the above (2), it provides a kit for screening<br>
promoters or inhibitors, characterixed in that it contains the protein or the<br>
prtial peptide or the salts of this invention, and a cell that is a normal cell<br>
containing a blood cell derived from a tissue of the above warm-blooded<br>
animals (preferably human) or the above-mentioned cancer cell or the like.<br>
Further, concretely, in the screening method, case (i) and case (ii) are<br>
characterized in that the cytotoxic activities of the protein and the like of this<br>
invention are determined and compared.<br>
The cytotoxic activity, the cell multiplication inhibition activity, and the<br>
activity causing cell death of the protein or the like of this invention can be<br>
determined by a known method or a similar method. However, more<br>
concretely, using established cell lines and the like, further, a substrate<br>
containing the test compound, a negative control which is a substrate not<br><br>
containing the test compound, and a positive control which is a substrate<br>
containing M toxin, these three or two are used. Comparing the cell numbers<br>
under the conditions satisfyable in statistical significance, inhibition activity<br>
of the cytotoxic activity or the cell multiplication activity, or the specified<br>
sample having the inhibition activity of the cytotoxic activity or the cell<br>
multiplication activity can be detected by existence or absence of the activities<br>
or increase and decrease. The cells used in the detection method are, for<br>
example, normal cells containing a blood cell derived from a tissue of the<br>
above warm-blooded animals (preferably human) or the above-mentioned<br>
cancer cells of several kinds of warm-blooded animals (for example, cancer of<br>
the endometrium, endometrioma, breast cancer, cancer of the stomach,<br>
hepatic carcinoma, spleen cancer, carcinoma of the galbladder, colon cancer,<br>
prostatic cancer, lung cancer, renal cancer, neuroblastoma, cancer of the<br>
urinary bladdar, malignant melanoma, cancer of the tongue, carcinoma of the<br>
gingiva, mouse fibroblast, African green monkey kidney rat liver cancer, and<br>
the like).<br>
As the test compunds, for example, peptides, proteins, non-peptide<br>
compounds, synthetic compounds, fermentation products, cell extracts, plant<br>
extracts, animal tissue extracts and the like can be exemplified. These<br>
compounds may be new compounds or known compounds. For conducting<br>
the above screening method, the protein or the like of this invention is<br>
suspended in buffer suitable to the screening, and the samples of the protein<br>
or the like of this invention are prepared. As the buffer, phosphate buffer of<br>
pH about 4~10 (preferably, pH about 6 ~ 8 ) , Tris-hydrochloride buffer or<br>
the like, which does not inhibit the reaction of the protein or the like of this<br>
invention and the test compounds, may be used.<br>
As concrete screening method, after the screening examination, (1) a<br>
method for directly observing the cell changes under a microscope and<br>
counting the cells with a hemocytometer or the like, (2) a method that the<br><br>
change of potassium, hemoglobins and the like, which are eluted from cells by<br>
the cell dath, is catched, (3) a method for determining the remaining cells<br>
after the reaction with tetrazolium salts or the like, (4) a method for<br>
determining the remining living cells with a radioactive labelled subsatance,<br>
(5) a method for confirming the cell death by induction of cell apoptosis and<br>
the like can be exemplified. For example, as a compound increasing the<br>
cytotoxic activity of the protein or the like of this invention, a test compound<br>
in which the cytotoxic activity in the above case (ii) compared with the above<br>
case (i) is increased by about 20% or more, more preferably 30 % or more,<br>
further preferably 50% or more, can be selected. On the other hand, as a<br>
compound inhibiting the cytotoxic activity of the protein or the like of this<br>
invention, a test compound in which the cytotoxic activity in the above case<br>
(ii) compared with the above case (i) is inhibited by about 20% or more, more<br>
preferably 30 % or more, further preferably 50% or more, can be selected.<br>
These may be conducted as a method for high throughput screening. In the<br>
following, as method (2), a method for determining hemoglobins by hemolytic<br>
reaction and as method (3), a WST method are respectively used. In the<br>
methods, active carbon, CM cellulose and calcium alginate are selected as<br>
adsorbents which show the anti-M toxin activity.<br>
It is further possible to examine and compare the solutions containing these<br>
anion control, positive control and test compounds with animal models to<br>
confirm the effects of the animal levels of the anti-M toxic materials. In<br>
these cases, many kinds of warm-blooded animals may be used. Particularly,<br>
a mouse, a rat, a dog, and a monkey may be used. As infected models, a<br>
Mongolian gerbil, a mouse and a monkey are effectively used.<br>
When the compounds obtained by the screening method or the kit for<br>
screening of this invention are used as the above treating and preventing<br>
agents, these compounds can be used by usual means. For example, using<br>
the same methods of the pharmaceutical preparations of the protein of the<br><br>
invention, they are used as tablets, capsules, elixirs, microcapsules, sterile<br>
solutions, suspension or the like. As such obtained preparations are safety<br>
and have low toxicity, for example, they may be administered to a human or a<br>
warm-blooded animal (such as a mouse, a rat, a rabbit, a goat, a pig, a cow, a<br>
horse, a bird, a cat, a dog, a monkey and the like). The dosage weights of the<br>
compounds or salts thereof are changed by the action, the disease, the dosage<br>
route or the like. When the compounds are used for increasing the function<br>
of the protein or the Like of this invention as a tissue regeneration agent after<br>
removing the disease tissues, commonly, in adults (estimated at 60 kg weight),<br>
about 0.1~100mg of the compound per day, preferably about 1.0~50mg, more<br>
preferbly about 1.0~20mg can be orally administered. For the other animals,<br>
the dosage of the weight estimated at 60kg can be used.<br>
Quantification of the protein or the partial peptide or the salts of this<br>
invention:<br>
The antibodies for the protein and the like of this invention (occasionally,<br>
abbreviated as the antibodies of this invention, hereinafter) can specifically<br>
recognize the protein and the like of this invention, so that they can be used<br>
for quantification of the protein and the like of this invention in test liquid,<br>
particularly, quantification by a sandwich immunization technique. Namely,<br>
this invention provides (i) a method for quantifying the protein and the like<br>
of this invention in test liquid, characterized in that the antibody of this<br>
invention and test liquid and the protein and the like of this invention are<br>
conpetitively reacted, the ratios of the labelled protein and the like of this<br>
invention that bind to the antibody are determined, and (ii) a method for<br>
quantifying the protein and the like of this invention in test liquid,<br>
characterized in that the test liquid and the antibody insolubilized on a carrier<br>
and the other labelled antibody of this invention are reacted at the same time<br>
or continuously, and then the activity of the labeling agent on the insolubilized<br>
carrier is determined. In the above quantitative method (ii), preferably, one<br><br>
antibody is an antibody recognizing the N ends of the protein and the like of<br>
this invention, the other antibody is an antibody reacting with the C ends of<br>
the protein and the like of this invention.<br>
Moreover, using a monoclonal antibody for the protein and the like of this<br>
invention (ocasionally abbreviated as a monoclonal antibody of this invention,<br>
hereinafter), the quantification of the protein and the like of this invention<br>
can be conducted, and further, the detection can be conducted by using tissue<br>
dyeing. As these objects, antibody moleculars themselves may be used, or<br>
F(ab")2, Fab", or Fab fraction of antibody moleculars may be used. The<br>
quantification of the protein and the like of this invention using of this<br>
invention should not be limited. For example, the quantity of the antibody,<br>
antigen or antibody-antigen complex corresponding to the quantity of the<br>
antigen (for example, the quantity of the protein) in the test liquid is<br>
chemically or physically detected, the obtained quantity is determined by a<br>
standard curve that is formed by standard liquid containing the antigen of a<br>
known quantity. As examples, nephelometry, a competition method, an<br>
immunometric method, and a sandwich method are preferably usable.<br>
Considering sensitivity and specificity, the after-mentioned sandwich method<br>
is preferred. As the labelling agents used in a determination method with a<br>
labelled substance, for example, a radioactive isotope, enzyme, fluorescence<br>
substance, luminescent substance and the like are exemplified. As the<br>
radioactive isotope, for example, (125I) (131I), (3H), (14C) may be used.<br>
As the enzyme, stable and high active isotopes, for example, ß-galactosidase,<br>
ß -glucosidase, alkaliphosphatase, peroxidase, a dehydrogenase of malic acid<br>
and the like may be used. As the fluorescence substance, for example,<br>
fluorescamine, fluorescein isothiocyanate and the like may be used. As the<br>
luminescent substance, for example, luminol, luminol derivatives, luciferin,<br>
lucigenin and the like may be used. Moreover, for the bind of an antibody or<br>
an antigen and a labelling agent, a biotin-avidin type may be used.<br><br>
The insolubilization of an antigen or an antibody may be conducted by<br>
physical adsorption, or the chemical bonding usually used for the<br>
insolubilization of proteins or enzymes. As the carrier, insoluble<br>
polysaccharides such as agarose, dextran and cellulose, synthetic resins such<br>
as polystyrene, polyacrylamide and silicone or glass can be exemplified. In<br>
the sandwich method, the test liquid is reacted with the insolubilized<br>
monoclonal antibody of this invention (primary reaction), then it is reacted<br>
with the other labelled monoclonal antibody of this inevention (secondary<br>
reaction), and the activity of the labelling agent on the insolubilized carrier is<br>
determined to determine the quantity of the protein of this invention in the<br>
test liquid. The primary reaction and the secondary reaction can be changed.<br>
Otherwise these reactions may be conducted at the same time or by sliding<br>
the starting times. The labelling agent and the isolubilizing method may be<br>
treated the same as these reactions. In the immuno assay by using the<br>
sandwich method, it is unnecessary that the antibody used as an antibody for<br>
a solid phase or an antibody for labelling is one kind. A mixture of two or<br>
more kinds of antibodies may be used for improving the determination<br>
sensitivity. In the determination method of the protein and the like of this<br>
invention by using the sandwich method of this invention, the monoclonal<br>
antibodies used in the primary reaction and the secondary reaction preferably<br>
have different parts that the protein and the like of this invention is bound.<br>
Namely, as to the antibodies used in the primary reaction and the secondary<br>
reaction, for example, when the antibody used in the secondary reaction<br>
recognaize the C end of the protein and the like of this invention, the antibody<br>
used in the primary reaction preferably recognize a part except the C end, for<br>
example, the N end.<br>
The monoclonal antibody of this invention may be used in a determination<br>
system except the sandwich method such as a competition method, or an<br>
immunometric method or nephelometry. In the competition method,<br><br>
antigens and labelled antigens in test liquid are competitively reacted with<br>
antibodies, and then unreacted labelled antibodies (F) and labelled antigens<br>
(B) bound to the antibodies are separated (B/F separation), the labelled<br>
quantity of B or F is determined, and the antigen quantity is quantified. In<br>
the reaction method, soluble antibodies are used as antibodies. In the B/F<br>
separation, a liquid phase method that polyethyleneglycol or the second<br>
antibody for the above antibody is used, and a solid phase method that a solid<br>
phase antibody is used as the first antibody, or a soluble antibody is used as<br>
the first antibody and a solid phase antibody is used as the second antibody<br>
are exemplified. In the immunometric method, the antigens and the solid<br>
phase antigens in the test liquid are competitively reacted with labelled<br>
antibodies of a definite amount and then the solid phase and the liquid pahse<br>
are separated. Otherwise, the antigens in the test liquid and the labelled<br>
antibodies of an excess amount are reacted, the solid phase antibodies are<br>
added to bind the unreacted labelled antibodies to the solid phase, and the<br>
solid phase and the liquid phase are separated. Continuously, the labelled<br>
quantity of any one of the both phases is determined, and the antigen quantity<br>
in the test liquid is determined. In the nephelometry, the quantity of<br>
unsoluble precipitates occured as the result of the antigen-antibody reaction<br>
in the gel or in the solution is determained. When the quantity of antigens in<br>
the test liquid is little and a small amount of precipitates are obtained,<br>
lasernephelometry using laser scattering and the like may be preferably used.<br>
When these immunological determination methods are applied in the<br>
determination method of this invention, special conditions and establishment<br>
of operations are unnecessary. Adding common technical ideas in the fields<br>
to usual conditions and operation methods in each method, the determination<br>
systems of the protein and the like of this invention may be constructed. As<br>

as a mouse, a rabbit, a goat, a pig, a cow, a cat, a dog, a monkey and the like).<br>
The dosage of the agents is changed by the object, the disease, the condition of<br>

Examples<br>
This invention will be understood more readily in reference to the following<br>
examples. However, these examples are intended to illustrate this invention<br>
and are not to be construed to limit the scope of the invention. The gene<br>
manipulation using E.coli was according to the method described in Molecular<br>
Cloning.<br>
Example 1: A method for purifying and extracting the toxin of this invention<br>
from Helicobacter pylori<br>
Helicobacter pylori can. be obtained by a separated strain which has already<br>
established (for example, from American Type Culture Collection) or by<br>
culturing a strain separated from clinical test samples. In this example, a<br>
separated strain of Helicobacter pylori 60190 was used. Using an agar<br>
medium that 5% bovine serum (produced by Sigma Co.) was added to a Brain<br>
Heart Infusion agar medium (poduced by Difco Co.), this separated strain was<br>
subcultured in 2-5 passages for about 1-2 weeks at a temperature of 37°C and<br>
a humidity of 90% or more under microaerobic conditions (CO25-10%). It<br>
was confirmed under a microscope that the cells were not died or not in a<br>
colloi form but grown satisfactorily. The cells were transferred to Brain<br>
Heart Infusion agar culture (produced by Difco Co.) plate containing not<br><br>
serum but 5% 2,6-di-O-methyl-ß-cyclodextrin. After the culture and grown<br>
conditions were confirmed under the same conditions as described in the<br>
above, the cells were transferred to cultures containing 2,6-di-O-methyl-ß-<br>
cyclodextrin with gradual stepwise decreases, i.e., 2%, 1% and 0.5% of the<br>
concentration.<br>
In a liquid culture of Brain Heart Infusion containing 0.5% 2,6-di-O-methyl-<br>
ß -cyclodextrin, the cells were cultured at a temperature of 37 °C under<br>
microaerobic conditions for about 16 hours, while agitated with a rotary<br>
shaker at 100-120rpm. Pelletal bacteria cells were collected in by<br>
centrifugation at 10000 Xg for 20 minutes. These were suspended in 10mM<br>
Tris-HCl pH7.7 buffer (abbreviated as buffer A, hereinafter. The pH is fully<br>
6.1 or more, because the pH of aimed protein is pI 6.08.) and sonicated. After<br>
storing overnight at a temperature of — 80OC, the cells were sonicated again<br>
and centrifuged at 100000 X g for 60 minutes. Only the most upper layer of<br>
separated three layers was extracted.<br>
The extract liquid was crudely purified with a 70% solution of ammonium<br>
sulfat. The resulting extract was purified by ion exchange chromatography<br>
with anion exchange resin of beads having relatively big particle diameters<br>
(DEAE Sephacel of Amersham Pharmacia Biotech AB). The buffer A was<br>
used as equilibrium buffer, and a mixture of the buffer A and a solution of<br>
0.3M NaCl salt was used as eluate. Using the buffer A and the eluate, the<br>
cells were extracted by concentration gradient. A suitable quantity of each<br>
fraction was added dropwise on wells that HeLa cells were seeded, and cell<br>
viability was evaluated in each well. The evaluation was conducted by using<br>
WST assay using Cell Counting kits (DOJIN Laboratories). Comparing with<br>
a control, fractions showing significantly less viability and fractions having<br>
relatively coinciding increase curves of the protein were evaluated along with<br>
the results of electrophoresis to use as sample fractions for the next<br>
purification process.<br><br>
Hydrophobic chromatography (Phenyl Sepharose CL-4B, Amersham<br>
Pharmacia Biotech AB) that has a different separation system from that of the<br>
next time was selected. Equilibrium buffer containing 1M ammonium<br>
sulfate in 10mM phosphate buffer was used. Elution buffer containing 40%<br>
ethylene glycol in 10mM phosphate buffer was used. After the cells were<br>
extracted by concentration gradient, each sample was evaluated by the same<br>
method as described in the above.<br>
The samples extracted by the above process were extracted again by anion<br>
exchange chromatography with beads having relatively small particle<br>
diameters (RESOURCE Q of Amersham Pharmacia Biotech AB). The buffer<br>
A was used as equilibrium buffer, and a mixture of the buffer A and a solution<br>
of 1M NaCl salt was used as elution buffer. Using the chromatography, a<br>
single band of protein of about 41000 of a molecular weight was finally<br>
obtained. The kind and order of these chromatographys may be changed and<br>
may be further added.<br>
After the resulting signal band was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue,<br>
it was transcripted on a nitrocellulose membrane or (polyvinylidene<br>
difluoride) membrane with a blotting apparatus and analyzed with an amino<br>
acid sequencer. As the results, as described in the above, the amino acid<br>
sequences of N ends of gene locus HP 103 7 of a registered database<br>
(Helicobacter pylori 22695) matched with 95% (19 bases in 20 bases). (Fig. 1)<br>
Example 2: Amino acid sequences and DNA sequences by a gene<br>
technological production method<br>
In this example, a separation strain of Helicobacter pylori 60190 was used.<br>
As described in the above, all gene analyses of Helicobacter pylori 22695 of<br>
different strains were already done. Homologous gene locus can be<br>
estimated by the search for the database of TIGR (The Institute for Genomic<br>
Research). It was found that gene locus HP 1037 of Helicobacter pylori 22695<br>
coded the homologous protein.<br><br>
From the results, the cloning of the protein of this invention was performed.<br>
Namely, Helicobacter pylori 60190 was used as a template, firstly,<br>
conveniently plural groups of suitable primers based on gene locus HP1037<br>
and gene locus HP 1036 of the upstream and gene locus HP 1038 of the<br>
downstream were formed (at 5" site and 3" site) to perform sequening. DNA<br>
polymerase having proofreading function was used. Each group of primers<br>
was constituted so as to contain sufficient mutual primer parts, and plural<br>
sequencings from 5" site and 3" site were performed. The resulting DNA<br>
sequences were shown in SEQ ID No. 2 of the sequence listing. The amino<br>
acid sequences were shown in SEQ ID No.1.<br>
Example 3<br>
Expression experiment of the toxic protein by gene recombination<br>
E.coli was used in the expression experiment. Vector pET-30EK/LIC<br>
(producted by Novagen Co.) and E.coli BL21 (DE3) for expression were used.<br>
The sense primer was SEQ ID No.3 inserting GACGACGACAAG at 5" site of<br>
the sense chain to the code of the toxic protein derived from Helicobacter<br>
pylori 60190 that was cloned in Example 2. The antisense primer was SEQ ID<br>
No.4 inserting GAGGAGAAGCCCGGTTA at 5" site. Inserting genes were<br>
formed by a PCR method by using the above primers. The inserted genes were<br>
prepared in the presence of 25mM dATP and 100mM DTT with T4 DNA<br>
polymerase to fit for LIC site of the vector and warmed in the presence of<br>
25mM EDTA. The formed recombinant was again sequenced to confirm that<br>
was identical with SEQ ID No. 1. It was further transformed into E.coli<br>
BL21 (DE3) for expression, and cultured in a LB medium contining 30µg/ml<br>
of kanamycin.<br>
Shake culture was conducted to obtain about 0.4 of OD600 at a temperature<br>
of 37°C at 250rpm. Isopropyl-beta-thiogalactoside was added to obtain the<br>
final concentration of 1mM, and further the mixture was shaked for 2 hours.<br>
Since the fused protein formed an inclusion body, E.coli was collected with<br><br>
centrifugation, and the inclusion body of the protein was obtained with a<br>
BugBuster reagent and Benzonase Nuclease (both are available from Novagen<br>
Co.) . The protein was separated by an electrophoresis method of sodium<br>
dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel (SDS-PAGE), and the corresponding single<br>
band was confirmed by silver stain. The protein was then refolded and<br>
compared with the control with a WST reagent (Dojin Chemical Laboratories<br>
Ltd. Cell Counting Kit) by using HeLa cells and the other warm-blooded<br>
animal cells. As the results, significant differences of survival were<br>
evaluated, and it was found that the expression protein had equal activities to<br>
those of purified protein. It was found that the expression protein had the<br>
same activities to the normal human gastric cells as HeLa cells of cervical<br>
cancer cells. (Fig.2). It was also found that not only to the other human<br>
tissues, but also to manmalian cells the protein had broad activities. (Fig. 3,<br>
Fig.4).<br>
Example 4<br>
Forming of monoclonal anti-M toxic antibody:<br>
Expression M toxin 240 µg, which had been refolded, was subcutaneously<br>
administered two times at several positions of BALB/C mouse. After 4 days<br>
of final immunization, the mouse spleen was excised and press filtered with<br>
stainless meshes, and suspended on Eagle"s modified minimum essential<br>
medium (MEM) to obtain a suspended solution of spleen cells. As the cells<br>
used for cell fusion, Myeloma cells P3-X63. Ag 8. U1 (P3U1) derived from<br>
BALB/C mouse was used as the cells used in the cell fusion. (Current topics in<br>
microbiology and immunology, 81, 1(1978)}O The cell fusion was conducted in<br>
accordance with the origin method CNature, 256, 495 (1975)3 . Namely, spleen<br>
cells and P3U1 were washed respectively with MEM not containing serum<br>
three times and mixed at 6.6 : 1 of a ratio of spleen cells and P3U1 numbers.<br>
Cells were precipitated by centifugation at 750 X g for 15 minutes. All of the<br>
supernatant was removed, and the precipitate was unfastened, 0.3 ml of 45%<br><br>
polyethylene glycol (PEG) 6000 (Productedby Wako Junyaku Co.) was added,<br>
and the mixture was permitted to stand in a warm water tank of 37°C for 7<br>
minutes to perform the fusion. After the fusion, MEM in limited amounts<br>
was added to the cells, and MEM of total 15 ml was added. The mixture was<br>
centrifuged at 750 x g for 15 minutes and the supernatant was removed. The<br>
cell precipitate was suspended in GIT medium (producted by Wako Junyaku<br>
Co.) (GIT-10% FCS) containing 10% bovine fetal serum to obtain P3U1 of 2 X<br>
105per 1 ml, and seeded into 24-well multi dishes (producted by Iwaki Co.) at<br>
1 ml per well in 168 wells. After seeding, the cells were incubated in 5%<br>
carbon dioxide incubator at a temperature of 37°C. After 24 hours, GIT—<br>
10%FCS medium (HAT medium) containing HAT (hypoxanthin 1X10-4M,<br>
aminopterin 4 X 10-7M and thymidine 1.6 X 10-3M) was added at 1 ml per well<br>
to initiate HAT selective cultivation. After 4 and 7 days, lml of the old liquid<br>
was discurded and the HAT selective cultivation was continued by adding 1<br>
ml of the HAT medium. Multiplication of hybridoma was found after 9 days<br>
of the cell fusion, and the supernatant was collected. The antibody value on<br>
the supernatant was determined by the following method. Namely, the<br>
culture supernatant 100µ1 and HRP-labelled M toxin 100µl, which is diluted<br>
to 200-fold with buffer C, were added into each well of microplates binding<br>
anti-mouse immunoglobulin antibody, and reacted overnight at a temperature<br>
of 4°C. After the plates were washed with PBS, to make microplates binding<br>
anti-mouse immunoglobulin antibody, firstly, a 0.1M carbonate buffer solution,<br>
pH9.6 containing goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin antibody (IgG fraction,<br>
producted by DAKO Co.) 100µg/ml was pipetted into 96-well microplates at<br>
100µl per plate, and is permitted to stand for 24 hours at a temperature of<br>
4°C. Then, the plates were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS,<br>
pH7.4) , 25% Brock Ace (trademark, producted by Yukijirushi Milk Products<br>
Co.) and PBS, pH7.2 containing 0.1% NaN3 were pipetted at each 300µl to<br>
block excess binding parts of the well and treated for at least 24 hours at a<br><br>
temperature of 4°C. To each well of the above microplates binding anti-<br>
mouse immunoglobulin antibody, mouse anti-serum 100 µl, which is diluted<br>
with buffer EC [0.02M phospahte buffer, pH7.0 containing 0.2%BSA, 0.4 M<br>
NaCl, 0.4% Brock Ace, 0.05 % CHAPS (3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethyl-<br>
ammonio]-l-propanesulfonate), 2mM EDTA and 0.1%NaN3], was added and<br>
reacted for 16 hours at a temperature of 4°C. Then, the plates were washed<br>
with PBS, pH7.4, and HRP-labelled refolding toxin protein 100µl was added<br>
and reacted for 7 hours at room temperature. The above refolding toxin<br>
protein was prepared in the above Example 3 by diluting to 100-fold with<br>
buffer C [0.02M phosphate buffer, pH7.0, containing 1%BSA, 0.4 M NaCl and<br>
2mM EDTA]. The plates were then washed with PBS, pH7.4, a TMB<br>
microwell peroxidase substitute system (KIRKEGAARD &amp; PERRY LAB.<br>
available from Funakoshi Yakuhin) 100µl was added, and reacted at room<br>
temperature for 10 minutes to determine the enzyme activity on the solid<br>
phase. After the reaction was stopped by adding 1M phosphoric acid 100 µl,<br>
the absorbance at 450nm was determined with a plate reader (MTP-120,<br>
producted by Corona Co.). According these methods, the enzyme activity on<br>
the solid phase was determined. As the results, 18 wells that the antibody<br>
value is found were selected from 123 wells, and the hybridomas were frozen<br>
and stored. Hybridomas of 6 wells, No.4, No.53, No.61, No.76, No.101 and<br>
No. 116 were cloned by dilution method. In the cloning, thymocytes of<br>
BALB/C mouse as feeder cells were added at 5 x 105 per well After the<br>
cloning, the antibody value of the supernatant was determined by the same<br>
method. Positive clones were No.4, No.101 and No. 116. These clones were<br>
as antibody-producing hybridomas of expression M toxin.<br>
Example 5<br>
Determination of a class and a subclass of monoclonal antibodies:<br>
By the method described in Example 4, anti-rabbit IgG-binding micro plates<br>
were formed. Namely, 0.1M carbonate buffer containing goat anti-<br><br>
pH9.6 was pipetted into 96-well microplates at 100 µl per well and left at a<br>
temperature of 4OC for 24 hours. The plates were then washed with<br>
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH7.4), 25% Block Ace (trademark,<br>
producted by Yukijirushi Milk Products Co.) and PBS, pH7.2 containing 0.1%<br>
NaN3 were pipetted at each 300µl to block excess binding parts of the well<br>
and treated for at least 24 hours at a temperature of 4°C. To the anti-rabbit<br>
IgG antibody-binding microplates, buffer EC 50 µ1 and subtype specific<br>
antibody 100µl containing in an iso-type typing kit producted by Bio-Rad<br>
Laboratories were added to react for one day at a temperature of 4°C. After<br>
the plates were washed with PBS, pH7.4, the culture supernatant of the<br>
hybridomas described above was added and reacted for one day at a<br>
temperature of 4°C. The plates was washed with PBS, pH7.4, and HRP-<br>
labelled refolding toxin protein 100 µl which was prepared in the above<br>
Example 3 by diluting to 100-fold with buffer C [0.02M phosphate buffer,<br>
pH7.0, containing 1%BSA, 0.4 M NaCl and 2mM EDTA], was added and<br>
reacted for 6 hours at room temperature. The plates were washed with PBS,<br>
pH7.4, and the enzyme activity on the solid phase was determined by the<br>
method described in Example 4. As the results, the subclasses of the<br>
monoclonal antibody porduced by these hybridomas were No.4 (IgGl), No. 101<br>
(IgG2b) and No.116 (IgG2a).<br>
Example 6<br>
A method for producing mouse ascites fluid of hybridoms:<br>
Hybridomas, No.4, No.101 and No. 116 were mouse ascites. Mineral oil<br>
0.5ml was parentherally administered to mice, previously. To the mice<br>
(BALB/C, female), the above s were parentheraUy sdministered at 1-3 X106<br>
cells/mouse, and the ascites containing the antibody were collected after 6-20<br>
days. The monoclonal antibody was purified from the obtained ascites with a<br>
protein-A column. Namely, the ascites about 25ml were diluted with the<br>
same volume of binding buffer (3.5M NaCl, 1.5M glycin containing 0.05%<br><br>
NaN3, pH9.0), the solution was precipitate to a recombinant protein-A-agalose<br>
(Repligen Co.) column that was previously equilibrated with binding buffer,<br>
the specific antibody was eluted with elution buffer (0.1M citric acid buffer,<br>
pH3.0 containing 0.05% NaN;). The elution liquid was dialyzed with PBS,<br>
pH7.4 at a temperature of 4°C for 2 days, and filtered for removing bacilli<br>
with a filter of 0.22 µl m (producted by Millipore Co.) or stored at a<br>
temperature of—80°C.<br>
Example 7 Preparation of polyclonal antibody M toxin<br>
Cytotoxic protein M toxin of this invention 4.1 mg was mixed with Freund3 s<br>
complete adjuvant and the mixture was subcutaneously immunized to a rabbit.<br>
After one week, the same amount of the M toxin was mixed with Freund" s<br>
incomplete adjuvant and the mixture was further subcutaneously immunized to<br>
the rabbit. After the immunization, collected blood was centrifuged to remove<br>
hemocyte components, and anti-serum was obtained.<br>
Example 8<br>
Analysis of M toxin by Western Blotting:<br>
SDS-Sample Buffer containing 2-mercaptoethanol was added to the<br>
supernatant obtained in Example 3, the mixture was electrophoresed with<br>
Peptide-PAGE (TEFCO) and electrically transferred to a PVDFmemmbrane<br>
(Amersham). Each antibody (2 µg/ml) obtained in Example 4 and Example 6<br>
was used as primary antibody. HRP (Horseradish peroxidase) -labelled-anti-<br>
rabbit and anti-mouse IgG antibodies (2000-fold dilution; Dako) was used as<br>
secondary antibody. The coloration was performed with an ECL Western<br>
Blot Detection System (Amersham). As the results, it was confirmed that each<br>
primary antibody recognized the expression protein. (Fig.5).<br>
Example 9<br>
Active carbon (0.2~0.1mm of diameter), CM cellulose and calcium alginate,<br>
each 0.5ml, were charged in three colums. After equilibrating with Tris<br>
buffer 10mM, pH7.7, 0.5ml of M toxin 400nM having refolded activity was<br><br>
added into each column, and these column was plugged and allowed to stand<br>
for 60 minutes at a temperature of 25°C. Meanwhile, Tris buffer alone and<br>
Tris buffer containing the same M toxin were allowed to stand under the same<br>
conditions. All columns were then opened, each 100 µ 1 dropping from<br>
columns was separated, further, each Tris-buffer 0.5ml was added to each<br>
column, and each 100 µl was collected. Whole blood of normal adults was<br>
centrifuged 2-3 times at 800 X g for 10 minutes until the supernatant became<br>
transpalent. The precipitated erythrocytes 10µ1 added to 10mM Tris buffer<br>
990 µl 1 was used as a positive control. Similarly, the precipitated<br>
erythrocytes 10 µl added to 0.9% salt 10mM Tris buffer was used as a<br>
negative control. Samples were collected from the above columns.<br>
Erythrocytes of 1 volume per 100 volume of the sample were added to the<br>
samples. The controls and the samples were compared by the eluted<br>
hemoglobin relative concentration with a multiple plate reader (Biorad) by<br>
measuring as an absorbance of 415nm. (Fig. 6).<br>
Example 10<br>
The ratios that HeLa cells (human cancer cells of the uterine cervix) were<br>
exposed to the fractions from each columns of Examole 9 and the viability<br>
were determined by a WST method using a tetrazolium salt. HeLa cells were<br>
cultured in 96-well plates for 24 hours at a ratio of 10000 cells per well. A<br>
negative control of culture liquid only, each sample liquid, and a positive<br>
control of 20nM of the toxin protein were respectively added to each well, and<br>
thsese were cultured for 12 hoursat at a temperature of 37°C. Using a Cell<br>
Counting Kit (DOJIN LABOEATORIES Ltd. Co.) , the ratios of cell viability<br>
detected by a WST method were measured as an absorbance of 415nm<br>
wavelength. (Fig. 7, Fig. 8).<br>
