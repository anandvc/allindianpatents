				<td>The present invention relates to new aromatic di-keto denvatives and to their pharmaceutical^ acceptable salts, esters, ethers and other obvious chemical equivalents. The derivatives are glucose-6-phosphate translocase inhibitors and can be used in the treatment of diabetes mellitus. The present invention further relates to a process for the production of the derivatives, to the use of the derivatives and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts, esters, ethers and other obvious chemical equivalents as pharmaceuticals, in particular to their use in the treatment of diabetes mellitus, and to pharmaceutical compositions comprising the derivatives, pharmaceutically acceptable salts, esters, ethers or other obvious chemical equivalents thereof.<br>
Increased rate of hepatic glucose output is a general feature of diabetes mellitus. In particular, there is a strong correlation between fasting plasma glucose level in non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) and hepatic glucose output. The two pathways by which glucose is produced in the liver are gluconeogenesis and glycogenosis. The terminal steps of both pathways is catalysed by the microsomal glucose-6-phosphatase, a key enzyme in the homeostatic regulation of blood glucose levels. The level of this enzyme has also been known to be elevated in both experimental and pathological conditions of diabetes. Interference with this enzyme system should, therefore, result in a reduced hepatic glucose production.<br>
Hepatic glucose-6-phosphatase is a multicomponent system comprised of at least three functional activities: a glucose-6-phosphate translocase (T1), a glucose-6-phosphate phosphohydrolase and a phosphate/pyrophosphate translocase (T2). The glucose-6-phosphate translocase facilitates transport of glucose-6-phosphate into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The phosphohydrolase, with its active site situated on the lumenal surface of the ER, hydrolyses glucose-6-phosphate and releases glucose and phosphate into the lumen. While the efflux of phosphate is facilitated by the phosphate/pyrophosphate translocase, the exact mechanism of glucose efflux is still not clear.<br><br>
The high degree of substrate specificity of glucose-6-phosphate translocase makes this a potential target for pharmacological intervention in the treatment of diabetes mellitus. Thus, amongst physiologically occurring sugar phosphates, only glucose-6-phosphate is transported by the translocase. In contrast, the phosphatase is non-specific and is known to hydrolyse a variety of organic phosphate esters.<br>
A series of non-specific inhibitors of glucose-6-phosphatase has been described in the literature, e.g. phlorrhizin (J. Biol. Chem. 242,1955-1960 (1967)), 5,5'-dithio-bis-2-nitrobenzoic acid (Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 48, 694-699 (1972)), 2,2'-diisothiocyanatostilbene and 2-isothiocyanato-2'-acetoxystilbene (J. Biol. Chem. 255, 1113-1119(1980)). The first therapeutically utilizable inhibitors of the glucose-6-phosphatase system are proposed in EP-A-587 087 and EP-A-587 088..Kodaistatins A, B, C, and D described in PCT/EP 98/02247 are the first glucose-6-phosphate translocase inhibitors from microbial sources.<br>
The aromatic di-keto derivatives according to the present invention may be derived from a compound named mumbaistatin. Mumbaistatin is described in PCT/EP99/04127. It is a natural product obtainable by cultivation of the microorganism Streptomyces litmocidini, a sample of which has been deposited on July 4, 1997, with the German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures (DSMZ) under the accession no. DSM 11641The structural formula of mumbaistatin has now been determined and is given below:<br><br><br>
It has been found that certain derivatives of mumbaistatin have improved activity and are better tolerated in the mammalian body than mumbaistatin itself. Also, the separated diastereomers of mumbaistain have advantages over the mumbaistatin mixture of diastereomers.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
and its pharmaceutical^ acceptable salts, esters and ethers and other obvious chemical equivalents in all their stereoisomeric and tautomeric forms and mixtures thereof in any ratio.<br><br><br><br>
The term aryl' as used herein represents an optionally substituted benzyl or phenyl.<br><br>
The term 'acyl' as used herein represents an optionally substituted aliphatic, aromatic or heterocyclic acyl, for example Ci-C4aliphatic acyl, such as acetyl or propionyl, aromatic acyl, such as, benzoyl or toluyl, and heterocyclic acyl which is derived from 5- or 6-membered rings with 1-4 hetero atoms, such as, nicotinoyl, furyl, pyrrolyl,   thienyl, thiazolyl and oxazolyl.<br>
'Optionally substituted' as used herein means that the group in question is optionally substituted by one or more, preferably 1, 2, 3 or 4, identical or different substituents selected from: hydroxyl, Ci-C4alkyl, Ci-C4alkenyl, d-C4alkoxy, Ci-C4alkylthio. C1-C4alkoxycarbonyl, carbamoyl, carboxyl, trifluoromethyl, cyano, nitro, amino, Ci-C4alkylamino. diCi-C4alkylamino, amidino, aryloxy, arylamino and halogen.<br>
Halogen represents I, Br, CI or Fl, preferably CI or Br.<br>
The term 'cation' represents an inorganic metal ion or an organic ammonium ion. Examples which may be mentioned are, in particular, pharmacologically acceptable alkali metai ions or alkaline earth metal ions, preferably sodium, potassium, calcium or magnesium ion, the ammonium ion and, from the organic ammonium ions, in particular, an optionally substituted alkylated ammonium ion, such as, for example, the triethylammonium or diethanolammonium ion, as well as the morpholine, benzylammonium and procaine, L-arginine and L-lysine ion.<br>
The cyclus ring, which includes the carbon atoms marked 'c' and 'd' as used in the formulae may represent an optionally substituted, saturated, partly unsaturated or aromatic, carbocyclic or heterocyclic, simple or condensed ring system. A simple ring system means a monocyclic ring containing 3 to 6 ring atoms and a condensed ring system means a condensed dicyclic or tricyclic ring containing 6 to 14 ring atoms.<br>
The saturated carbocyclic ring system may represent a 3 to 14 membered ring system, preferably a simple 3 to 8 membered ring such as cyclo-C3-C8alkyl, more preferably cyclo-C3-C6alkyl, for example, cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl,<br><br>
cyclopentyl or cyclohexyl. It may also represent a bi- or tri-cyclic condensed ring system such as bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane and tetradecahydrophenanthrene.<br>
The partly unsaturated carbocyclic ring system differs from the saturated carbocyclic ring system in having one or two double or triple bonds. Thus it may represent a 3 to 14 membered ring system, preferably a 3 to 8 membered ring such as cyclo-C3-C8alkene, for example, cyclopentadiene or cyclooctatetraene, more preferably cyclo-Cs-Csalkene, or cyclo-Cs-Csalkyne.<br>
The aromatic carbocyclic simple or condensed ring system may represent a 5 to 14 membered monocyclic, dicyclic or tricyclic ring system such as phenyl, naphthyl, phenanthrene or anthraquinone.<br>
The heterocyclic ring system may be saturated, partly unsaturated or aromatic and may be a simple or condensed ring system as defined above. The heterocyclic ring system represents the carbocyclic ring system as defined above in which 1, 2, 3 or 4 of the C atoms are replaced by identical or different heteroatoms selected from N, O and S. It may, for example, represent a 5- or 6-membered ring which has 1 to 4 hetero-atoms, selected from 0, S and N, in particular N, optionally together with S or O as ring atoms. Some examples of heterocyclic ring systems are heteroalkyls such as pyrrolidine, piperidine, tetrahydrofuran, oxazolidine and thiazolidine, and heteroaryl residues such as pyridyl, pyrimidyl, furanyl, benzothiazoyl, benzofuranyl and indolyl.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
wherein<br>
Ri to R7, Xt to X7, cyclus and c and d are as defined above, with the exclusion of the compound where Xi to X7 are O, R1, R2 and R3 are H, R* is OH, R5| R6 and R7 are H and cyclus is 3, 8, di-hydroxy anthraquinone, and its pharmaceutically acceptable salts, esters and ethers and other obvious equivalents, in all their stereoisomeric and tautomeric forms and mixtures thereof in any ratio.<br>
Preferably the carbon marked with an asterisk has an S configuration, in which case the exclusion mentioned above is not applicable.<br>
Suitably, R1, R2and R3 are CrC6-alkyl, preferably C1-C4alkyl, such as methyl.<br>
Conveniently, any one or more of X1 to X7 are O.<br>
An example of a compound of the formula XVIII above is given below:<br><br><br>
The alkylated mumbaisatin derivatives of the formula XVIIIA and formula XVIIIB are obtained by dissolving murnbaistatin in a solvent, preferably an organic solvent such as alkanol, for example methanol, and reacting with an alkylating agent such as diazoalkane, for example diazomethane, diazoethane, or diarylmethyldiazomethane such as diphem    azomethane. The alkyl substituent in the above compounds of the formu     .VIIIA and formula XVIIIIB is preferably a C1-C4-alkyl. When the C1-C4-alkyl is methyl, for example, the methylated murnbaistatin derivatives may be obtained by reacting mumbaistain in solution with a methylating agent such as diazomethane.<br><br>
The mumbaistain has ideally previously been treated with acid, preferably low molecular organic acid, for example formic acid, acetic acid or trifluoroacetic acid. The reaction product is subsequently isolated, preferably by chromatography.<br>
Isolation of the compounds according to the present invention from the reaction medium can be effected by methods which are in themselves known and which depend on the solubility of the resulting compounds.<br>
A further example of a compound of the formula XVIII is the diastereomer given below:<br><br><br>
wherein the carbon atoms marked 'a' and 'b' in form of a half-ketal or ketal have independently the S or R configuration.<br><br><br>
its pharmaceutical^ acceptable salts, esters and ethers and other obvious chemical equivalents in all their stereoisomers and tautomeric forms and mixtures thereof in any ratio.<br><br><br><br>
One process for the preparation of a compound of the formula XIXA, XIXB or XIXIC comprises dissolving mumbaistatin in a solvent, preferably an organic solvent, for example an alkanol such as methanol, and reacting with a<br><br>
methylating agent such as diazomethane. Mumbaistain has ideally previously been treated with acid such as trifluoroacetic acid. The reaction product is isolated, preferably by chromatography.<br>
Mumbaistatin is of limited stability in solution at a pH of around 6 to 9. At acid pH mumbaistatin rapidly undergoes a complex conversion, for example to the compound of the formula XIXD above. Because the acid form of mumbaistain is reacted with diazomethane to produce the methylated compounds of the formula XVIIIA, XVIIIB, XIXA, XIXB and XIXC above, special precautions need to be taken to ensure that native, defined methylation products are obtained. It has been found that the required methylation products are obtained under cold conditions such as at temperatures of-1 °C to 3°C, preferably 0° C, and/or when the process is carried out without prolonged reaction times. It has surprisingly been possible to crystallize at least one of the methylation products by using a mixture of water and acetonitrile. This enabled determination of the structure of the compounds by X-radiation spectrometry.<br>

Ri to R7, Xi to X7, cyclus and c and d are as defined above, and<br>

A process for the preparation of a compound of the formula XXI1A comprises dissolving mumbaistatin in a solvent, preferably an organic solvent such as alkanol, and reacting with an amide source such as an ammonia solution. The process is carried out under cold conditions, preferably at a temperature of-1°C to 3° C, more preferably at 0°C. The reaction product is subsequently isolated.<br>
The invention furthermore relates to compounds of the general formula XXIV<br><br>
its pharmaceutically acceptable salts, esters and ethers and other obvious chemical equivalents, in all their stereoisomeric and tautomeric forms and mixtures thereof in any ratio.<br>
Preferably, one or more of Xi to X7 are O.<br>
The compounds according to the present invention are tautomers in which open and closed forms exist in equilibrium.<br>
The closed structures of the formula XIX to XXIV above can be converted to the open structure of the formula XVIII by reaction with a suitable base. Suitable bases which can be used for the reaction are inorganic or organic bases. Thus, tertiary amines and alkali metal carbonates, such as sodium carbonate, sodium<br><br><br>
The compounds according to the invention may be converted into pharmaceutical^ acceptable salts and obvious chemical equivalents, like esters and ethers, which are all covered by the present invention. The invention also covers all salts and obvious chemical equivalents of the present compounds which themselves are not suitable for use as pharmaceuticals but which can be used as intermediates in the preparation of pharmaceutically acceptable salts and derivatives. The invention covers the present aromatic di-keto derivatives and their salts, esters, ethers and other obvious chemical equivalents in all their stereoisomeric forms and tautomeric forms. The salts of the derivatives (e.g. Na, K, ammonium salts) can be prepared by standard procedures known to one skilled in the art. Salts like sodium and potassium salts, for example, may be prepared by treating the present compounds with suitable sodium or potassium bases.<br>
Esters may be prepared, for example, by reacting the present compounds with carboxylic acids in the presence of reagents such as dicyclohexylcarbodiimide<br><br>
(DCC), or by treating the compound with acylating agents such as acid chlorides. Other methods of preparation of esters are given in the literature, for example in J. March, Advanced Organic Synthesis, 4th Edition, John Wiley &amp; Sons, 1992.<br>
Ethers may be prepared, for example, from Mumbaistatin by reaction with alkylating agents under basic conditions. Other methods of preparation of ethers are given in the literature, for example in Advanced Organic Synthesis, 4th Edition, J. March, John Wiley &amp; Sons. 1992.<br>
Other obvious chemical equivalents include reduction or oxidation products and addition products such as hydrates. For example, the anthraquinone group of mumbaistatin may be reduced with a reducing agent to hydroquinone. The resultant product is an effective inhibitor of glucose-6-phosphate translocase with an IC50 of = ~5nM.<br>
Glucose-6-phosphate translocase activity has been shown in several biochemical test systems for mumbaistatin. The yield of mumbaistatin from the culture filtrate of Streptomyces litmocidini is extremely low, however, which has hindered further development of the compound. Moreover, until now it has not been possible to ascertain the structural formula of mumbaistatin due of numerous factors including the compounds inability to crystalize and instability in solution.<br>
A process has now been found, however, which enables the isolation of mumbaistatin from an extract in relatively high yield. The present invention accordingly provides a process for the isolation of mumbaistatin comprising extracting a culture filtrate including mumbaistain by ion exchange chromatography at a pH of 5-8, preferably 6 or 7. Although the use of ion exchange is generally mentioned in PCT/EP99/04127, it is clear that the use of ion exchange for the purpose of improving yield was not recognised. This is seen from the examples in the above patent application PCT/EP99/04127 where ion exchangers are not used for the isolation of mumbaistatin and where from 730 litres of culture filtrate merely 70 mg of pure mumbaistain is obtained. The process of the present invention allows the isolation and enrichment of mumbaistatin and mumbaistain-related compounds by means of an ion exchange process whereby yields of at least more than 50 %,<br><br>
more usually &gt; 70 % are obtained. Mumbaistain obtained according to the present process has an improved IC50 of = - 5 nM in comparison to the mumbaistain obtained in PCT/EP99/04127.<br>
In the process for the isolation of mumbaistatin according to the present invention various ion exchangers may be used. Examples are QAE-, DEAE- and THAE-anion exchangers. Preferably, substituted or unsubstituted amino groups are carried on the chosen matrix. More preferably, DEAE-anion exchangers are used such as DEAE-®Sepharose Fast Flow or ®Fractogel EMD DEAE. The anion exchangers may be used in a known manner. An organic solvent content of 5 to 85 % in a buffer system may be used. It is preferable, however, that the organic solvent used has a high content of buffer system, preferably therefore, an organic solvent content of 10 to 40 % in the aqueous buffer solution is used. Examples of suitable organic solvents are water-miscibie organic solvents such as lower alcohols, acetone, acetonitriie, glycol, dioxane, dimethyl sulfoxide, formamide and the like. Preferred solvents are methanol, ethanol, isopropanol and acetone.<br>
With the process described, &gt; 99% pure mumbaistatin can be obtained and the compound can be enriched in a yield of more than 70 %. The resultant enriched mumbaistatin may be purified in a simple manner by, for example, molecular sieve-and/or reverse-phase-chromatography.<br>
The compounds according to the invention inhibit rat liver microsomal glucose-6-phosphate translocase. The compounds are therefore useful as pharmaceutically active ingredients, in particular in the treatment of diabetes mellitus, and more generally in the treatment or prophylaxis of conditions which are caused by or associated with an elevated activity of glucose-6-phosphate translocase, or of conditions in which it is intended to reduce glucose-6-phosphate translocase activity. The compounds according to the present invention and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts, esters, ethers and other obvious chemical equivalents can be administered to animals, preferably to mammals, and in particular to humans as pharmaceuticals on their own, in mixtures with one another and in the form of pharmaceutical compositions which permit enteral or parenteral administration.<br><br>
Accordingly, the present invention also relates to aromatic di-keto derivatives and their pharmaceutical^ acceptable salts, esters, ethers and others obvious chemical equivalents for use as pharmaceuticals and to the use of the derivatives and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts, esters, ethers and other obvious chemical equivalents for the production of medicaments for reducing glucose-6-phosphate translocase activity, in particular for the production of medicaments for the treatment of diabetes mellitus. The present invention further relates to pharmaceutical compositions which contain an effective amount of the derivatives and/or one or more pharmaceutically acceptable salts, esters, ethers and/or obvious chemical equivalents thereof together with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.<br>
The compounds according to the invention can be administered orally, intramuscularly, intravenously or by other modes of administration. Pharmaceutical compositions which contain the present compounds or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or obvious chemical equivalent thereof singly or in combinations can be prepared according to standard techniques by mixing the compound(s) with one or more pharmacologically acceptable excipients and/or auxiliaries such as, for example, fillers, emulsifiers, lubricants, masking flavours, colorants or buffer substances, and converting the mixture into a suitable pharmaceutical form such as, for example, tablets, coated tablets, capsules or a suspension or solution suitable for enteral or parenteral administration.<br>
Examples of auxiliaries and/or excipients which may be mentioned are starch, tragacanth, lactose, talc, agar-agar, polyglycols, ethanol and water. Suitable and preferred for parenteral administration are suspension or solutions in water. It is also possible to administer the active substances as such, without vehicles or diluents, in a suitable form, for example, in capsules. Pharmaceutical compositions comprising one or more of the present compounds or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or obvious chemical equivalent may also contain other pharmaceutically active ingredients.<br>
As customary, the galenic formulation and the method of administration as well as the dosage range which are suitable in a specific case depend on the species to be treated and on the state of the respective condition or disease, and can be optimized<br><br>
using methods known in the art. On an average, the daily dose of a compound according to the present invention in a patient of about 75 mg weight is at least 0.001 mg to at most 100 mg, preferably at most 10.0 mg.<br>
Apart from use as pharmaceutically active ingredients and as intermediates in the production of derivatives, the present compounds and their salts and obvious chemical equivalents can also be employed as auxiliaries for diagnostic purposes, for example in in vitro diagnoses, and for research purposes in biochemical investigations in which an inhibition of glucose-6-phosphate translocase is desired.<br>

Maintenance of the culture Streptomyces litmocidini, DSM 11641.<br>
Culture DSM 11641 was maintained on the following medium :<br><br>
Malt extract	10.0 g<br>
Yeast extract	4.0 g<br>
Glucose	4.0 g<br>
Agar powder	13.0 g<br>
Demineralized water	1.0 litre<br>
pH	7.0<br>
After dissolving the above mentioned ingredients throughly by heating, it was distributed in test tubes and then sterilized at 121°C for 20 minutes. The test tubes were then cooled and allowed to solidify in a slanting position. The agar slants were streaked with the growth of the culture Streptomyces litmocidini, DSM 11641, by a<br><br>
wire loop and incubated at 28°C (± 1°C) until a good growth was observed. The well grown cultures were stored in the refrigerator at 8°C.<br>

Approximately 200 litres of culture broth was harvested and separated from mycelium (12 kg) by centrifugation. The desired compound Mumbaistatin was found to be present primarily in the culture filtrate. The culture filtrate (180 litres with 120 mg mumbaistatin ) was passed over a column filled with adsorption resin ®MCI GEL CHP20P (20 cm diameter x 45 cm height, content 14 litres). The column was eluted with a gradient process of from 120 litres 0.1% phosphate buffer, pH 6.3 to 120 litres 45% isopropanol in water. The column through-flow was 18 litres/hour. The largest amount of mumbaistatin (102 mg in 12 litres) was present in the salt-free fraction which was eluted with a step gradient of 25 to 28 % isopropanol in water. The resultant active eluate was passed through DEAE-®Sepharose Fast Flow filled column (3 litres) which had been equilibrated to pH 7.0 with phosphate buffer. Mumbaistatin was eluted in a gradient process with 20 % isopropanol in 0.1 % sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0 as A-buffer and 20 % isopropanol in 0.1 % phosphate buffer and 0.25 % NaCI as B-buffer. Using a flow rate of 50 ml /min„ 100 fractions were collected in which fractions 72 to 74 contained 81 mg of highly enriched mumbaistatin and fraction 75 a further 18 mg which was less pure. The fractions were pooled and concentrated in vacuum. The material was further purified by passing through a ®Nucleosil 100-10 C18AB column (2.1 cm x 25 cm) and eluted at pH 6.3 with a step gradient of 5 - 35 % acetonitrite in 0.05 % ammonium acetate buffer. Freeze drying of the pure fractions resulted in a total of 86 mg (73 + 13 mg ) pure mumbaistatin ammonium salt.<br>
The sodium salt of mumbaistain was prepared by dissolving 40 mg of the ammonium salt in 10 ml water (pH 6.4) and increasing the flow of the solution with sodium chloride to 12 mS/cm2. The resultant aqueous solution was then passed over a '"MCI GEL CHP20P column ( 1cm wide x 9cm high ). The elution results with a water/40% acetonitrile in water gradient, the column flow was 5 ml per minute and the fraction sizes were 10 ml. In fractions 16 to 19 the sodium salt was found and the purifed solution had a pH of 8.5. From these fractions resulted 32 mg mumbaistatin sodium salt after freeze-drying with a purity of 99%, measured by HPLC. UV maxima, dissolved in methanol:<br><br><br><br>
Inhibition of glucose-6-phosphate translocase from rat liver microsomes was with an IC50 of = 5 nM. Inhibition of microsomal glucose-6-phosphatase in 10 uM solution: activity was not demonstrable.<br>
Example 4<br>
Mumbaistatin methylation products<br>
18 mg mumbaistatin obtained according to Example 3 was dissolved in 50 ml water, cooled to 0°C and maintained at a pH of 2.8 with cold trifluoroacetic acid (TFA). Directly thereafter the resultant mixture was passed over a column ( 1 cm x 8 cm) filled with 6.2 ml ®MCI GEL, CHP20P, (75 - 150 urn), and eluted using a gradient of 0.01% TFA to 30 % acetonitrile in 0.01 % TFA. The flow rate was 2.5 ml /min. The eluates were cooled and the mumbaistatin-containing fractions directly frozen to -40° C and lyophilised.<br>
The freeze-dried product ( 15 mg ) was dissolved in methanol and methylated with diazomethane. After concentration in vacuum the reaction mixture, a mixture of more than ten methylation products was separated by passing over ®LiChrosorb RP18, 10u, column with dimensions 1 cm x 25 cm (width x length). Acetonitrile in water, 5 to 55 %, was used as the solution. The fractions were pooled cold and maintained under cold conditions during further processing. The fractions were concentrated in vacuum. Fraction 19 was mumbaistatin-mono-methylether-dimethyl ester corresponding to formula XVIIIA having a molecular weight of 590. The characteristic NMR data for the compound are shown in Table 3 above. Inhibition of glucose-6-translocase by a 3 uM solution: 42 %.<br>
A compound corresponding to formula XIXB was obtained from fraction 34 after concentration in vacuum under cold conditions. Crystallographic data for the compound are provided in Table 1 above. There exist the diastereomers S.R.R and<br><br>
S,S,S for the compound which are shown above. Inhibition of glucose-6-phosphate translocase: IC50= &gt; 100 uM.<br>
Fraction 26 contained a compound which, after storage, was the mumbaistatin tetramethyl derivative corresponding to formula XIXC. The relevant *H and 13C-NMR data for this compound are provided in Table 2 above.<br>
Example 5<br>
Mumbaistatin hemiketal-amide (Formula XXHIA)<br>
A 1 mi concentrated aqueous ammonia solution was added dropwise under an argon atmosphere at 0°C with stirring to a solution of 10 ml mumbaistatin in 1 ml methanol. The mixture was stirred at this temperature for 2 hours and subsequently the solution was removed in vacuum. 10 mg mumbaistatin-amide was obtained in the form of a beige powder. The molecular weight (548, M + H") was determined by electron spray mass spectrometry corresponding to the chemical formula C28H21NO11. 1H-NMR (500 MHz, DMSO-d6): 5 = 7.8 (d, 1H), 7.75 (t, 1H), 7.35 (m, 1H), 7.25 (s, 1H), 6.85 (t, 1H), 6.55 (d, 1H), 3.85 (m, 1H), 2.2-2.35 (m), 2.05 (m, 1H), 1.8 (m, 1H), 1.2-1.4 (m)ppm.<br>
