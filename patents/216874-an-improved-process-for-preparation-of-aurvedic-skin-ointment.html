				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to an improved process for<br>
preparation of Ayurvedic ointment and more particularly for treatment<br>
of burns, cuts, skin diseases, dry echzema, rashes, wounds of leprosy,<br>
mouth sours, ulcers and allied skin diseases.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
At present in the market various ointments are available for use<br>
and treating the above mentioned ailments. However these ointments<br>
have only temporary effect in that and after certain period again ailments<br>
reappear and one has to either continue with the treatment or choose<br>
some other ointment. In fact, certain ointments can offer relief for<br>
echzema and even for etches but effect is not lasting. Furthermore, these<br>
ointments are very expensive and sometimes are poisonous and,<br>
therefore, common man cannot afford them and he has to handle them<br>
very carefully and keep out of reach of children and has to use them in a<br>
very careful manner.<br>
It has, therefore, been a long felt need to develop such ointment<br>
for curing skin diseases like burns, cuts, echzema, rashes, wounds of<br>
leprosy, mouth sours, ulcers which is cost effective but is nonpoisonous<br>
and can be handled not only by men and women but also children.<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
These objects and others may be achieved by present invention.<br>
According to the present invention an improved process for<br>
preparation of Ayurvedic skin ointment in form of emulsion for<br>
treatment of minor burns, cuts, skin diseases, dry echzema, rashes,<br>
wounds of leprosy, mouth sours, ulcers and allied skin diseases which<br>
comprises:<br>
(i) cutting honey bee wax into small pieces of size 0.5 to 3 mm<br>
preferably 0.25 to 3 mm, preparing powder of camphor of size 0.01 to<br>
0.5 mesh and adding both ingredients to pure coconut oil which is in the<br>
ratio of 80 to 90% by weight of total composition;<br>
(ii) heating the contents of step (i) to a temperature upto 40°C for<br>
2 to 10 minutes and slowly adding thereto honey bee wax in a ratio of 4<br>
to 8% by weight of coconut oil and Camphor in a ratio of 6 to 12% of<br>
by weight of composition and stopping the heating of the composition;<br>
(iii) removing the contents of Step (ii) and adding the same in the<br>
container having pure water at a room temperature and making up pure<br>
water 8800 to 9900 times by weight of total composition of step (ii) and<br>
keeping the same aside for a period of 2 to 10 minutes and thereafter in<br>
net filtering the contents thereof to obtain the emulsion to be used as an<br>
ointment/lotion.<br><br>
We shall herein describe the present invention with reference to an<br>
example which is given by way of illustration but does not restrict the<br>
scope of present invention.<br>
Example 1:<br>
Honey bee wax is cut in small pieces preferably not more than 2 to<br>
3 cm in size. Camphor is taken and powder is made thereof by either<br>
hand grinding or machine grinding. In a container pure coconut oil of<br>
250 gm is taken and same is heated to a temperature of 26°C. As soon as<br>
Coconut oil reaches to a temperature 25°C and said small pieces of<br>
honey bee wax weighing 15 gms are added. As soon as the honey bee<br>
wax is dissolved in the said coconut oil, 20 gms of Camphor powder are<br>
added thereto and allowed to dissolve. In another container small<br>
amount of pure water is taken and thereto above mentioned contents of<br>
coconut oil, honey bee wax and camphor are added and further pure<br>
water is added so that total amount of purified water is about 10 litres<br>
and same is allowed to settle down for a period of 5 minutes and<br>
thereafter full contents are net filtered and packed in suitable containers<br>
like tubes and/or bottles which are bacteria free. The packing is done in<br>
normal manner .<br>
The coconut oil persee cannot be used for curing above<br>
mentioned ailments but same is true with regard to honey bee wax and<br>
camphor. However after mixing the same in proportions the same in<br>
proportions given above and preparing according to present invention<br><br>
due to synergistic effect the final composition can be used for curing above<br>
mentioned skin diseases including cracking of skins.<br>
Above mentioned composition acts also deodorant and removes<br>
the odour of body and makes the skin soft and smooth. In other words<br>
this lotion can be used as body lotion to keep the skin healthy.<br>
The obtained composition solidifies at room temperature which<br>
should be taken to avoid direct sun or extreme heat while storing the<br>
composition.<br><br>
I CLAIM :<br>
1. An improved process for preparation of Ayurvedic skin ointment<br>
in form of emulsion for treatment of minor burns, cuts, skin diseases,<br>

ratio of 80 to 90% by weight of total composition;<br>
(ii) heating the contents of step (i) to a temperature upto 40°C for<br>
2 to 10 minutes and slowly adding thereto honey bee wax in a ratio of 4<br>
to 8% by weight of coconut oil and Camphor in a ratio of 6 to 12% of<br>
by weight of composition and stopping the heating of the composition;<br>
(iii) removing the contents of Step (ii) and adding the same in the<br>
container having pure water at a room temperature and making up pure<br>
water 8800 to 9900 times by weight of total composition of step (ii) and<br>
keeping the same aside for a period of 2 to 10 minutes and thereafter in<br><br>
net filtering the contents thereof to obtain the emulsion to be used as an<br>
ointment/lotion.<br>
2. The process as claimed in claim 1, wherein the coconut oil, honey<br>
bee wax and Camphor are mixed in a container be large enough so that<br>
while mixing the ingredients any foam if formed, the same should not<br>
spilt out.<br>
3. The process as claimed in any one of claims 1 or 2, wherein the<br>
contents are packed in either tube or bottle which should be free of<br>
bacteria.<br>
