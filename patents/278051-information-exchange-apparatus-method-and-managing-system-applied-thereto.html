				<td>INFORMATION EXCHANGE APPARATUS, METHOD AND MANAGING SYSTEM APPLIED THERETO<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to an apparatus, a method and a system, and more particularly to an information exchange apparatus that allows an user to share and exchange his information with other users, an information exchange method applied to the information exchange apparatus and a managing system applied to the information exchange apparatus.<br>
2.	Description of Related Art<br>
Today, people are living in a world that is full of new knowledge and information. People also spread new knowledge and information instead of retrieving them because of the popularity of the Internet. For example, online dating, e-commerce, web logs (blogs) or the like are popular information exchange services via the Internet. The information exchange services create virtual environments for people to exchange information or communicate with each other. However, people cannot really know each other in the virtual environments because the virtual environments are not the real world. Shortcomings of information exchange services via the Internet such as online dating and e-commerce are described as follows.<br>
Online dating is implemented on a website that has members and allows the members to contact and share personal information with each other over the Internet for developing friendships or romantic relationships by using computers or cell phones. However, because members do not meet each other face to face<br>
 <br>
during online dating, some members may misrepresent themselves or provide fake information. This is why Internet fraud happens frequently. There is an inherent lack of trust between members.<br>
E-commerce is also implemented on a website that provides products or services and allows users to buy or sell over the Internet. However, because the consumers cannot check interested products before purchase, it is not easy for consumers to pick out what they want. The consumers are also at a high risk of fraud because E-commerce often requires the consumers to pay first. On the other hand, because E-commerce is a one-way service, the proprietor who provides products to consumers does not understand what the consumers are interested in. The proprietor of E-commerce cannot provide new products according to what the consumers are interested in. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The main objective of the invention is to provide an information exchange apparatus, method and managing system applied thereto.<br>
The information exchange apparatus in accordance with the present invention comprises a processing unit, a wireless communication unit, a storage unit, a mainframe connection port and an identification module. The processing unit has a clock that counts time and provides local time. The wireless communication unit has a transmitter and a receiver, and the transmitter and the receiver are connected to the processing unit. The storage unit is connected to the processing unit and stores a device identification (ID) code, user information and data exchange records, and each data exchange record has exchanged content, exchange time and device ID code of a target information exchange apparatus.<br>
 <br>
The mainframe connection port is connected to the processing unit for connecting to an electronic device such as a computer so the electronic device is capable to set and exchange data with the information exchange apparatus. The identification module is connected to the processing unit, has a secure memory and stores an identification procedure. The secure memory stores the device ID code and an identification key. The identification module allows the processing unit to access data in the storage unit and exchange data in the storage unit with other information exchange apparatus when the processing unit executes and passes the identification procedure.<br>
The managing system in accordance with the present invention allows the above mentioned information exchange apparatus to connect thereto to upload or download data. The managing system comprises a database, a website and a data analysis module. The database stores basic information of the information exchange apparatus, the data exchange records in the information exchange apparatus, owner information and the information of the relationship between the owners and the information exchange apparatuses. The website is connected to the database and allows receiving uploaded basic information of the information exchange apparatus and the data exchange records in the information exchange apparatus. The website also allows the information exchange apparatus to upload and download data to and from thereto. The data analysis module is connected to the database and the website to analyze the information in the database and the data exchange records from the information exchange apparatus.<br>
The information exchange apparatus intermittently broadcasts wireless<br>
 <br>
signals to notify nearby information exchange apparatuses. When one user with the information exchange apparatus is close to other users (may be people or shops) with the information exchange apparatuses, the information exchange apparatuses exchange the user information with each other.<br>
When the user with the information exchange apparatus meets strangers with the information exchange apparatuses by chance, the user can know the strangers from the exchanged user information. Because the users also meet the strangers face to face, the user can actually know the correctness of the user information. The information exchange can reduce Internet fraud frequently happening to online dating.<br>
On the other hand, if the information exchange apparatus is set in a shop, the information exchange apparatus intermittently broadcasts wireless signals including user information, that is the product information, to notify nearby information exchange apparatuses. When the users with the information exchange apparatuses are close to the shop, the users can read the product information in the shop from the exchanged user information. Further, the shop owner can also post new product information on the website in the managing system to allow the user's information exchange apparatus to download the new product information so the new products can be promoted through the information exchange apparatus and the managing system.

The information exchange apparatus and managing system of the<br>
 <br>
present invention used to maice new friends is described in the following. A member card represents the information exchange apparatus of the present invention hereinafter because the information exchange apparatus may be implemented to have a card appearance in the foregoing descriptions.<br>
The member card is used to identify a user and stores records of the user and other target members with their member cards. In addition to analyzing the information in the database (61) and the data exchange records from the member card to obtain analysis results, the managing system also provides member registration, web log (blog) and other interactive capabilities as provided by a general community website. The user information stored in the storage unit (30) of the member card comprises member data and meeting records. The member data comprises member account, member serial number, blog Uniform Resource Locator (URL) and the like. Each meeting record comprises date, time and met member account.<br>
The member card operates in either a standalone mode or a connection mode. The standalone mode is the default mode.<br>
The standalone mode is operated when the member card does not connect to an electronic device such as a computer. In the standalone mode, the member card executes a broadcast and listen process. The broadcast and listen process allows the member card to find out a target member card nearby. With further reference to Fig. 4, the broadcast and listen process comprises steps of operating the wireless communication unit as a transmitter (301), wirelessly broadcasting message packets (302), operating the wireless communication unit as a receiver (303) after broadcasting the messag? packets, listening to a<br>
 <br>
response from a target member card nearby (304), operating the wireless communication unit as a transmitter again (305), wirelessly broadcasting the member serial number and the member account (306), listening to a response from the member card nearby (307) and switching off the wireless communication unit (308). The steps (301) to (308) are repeated.<br>
In the step of wirelessly broadcasting message packets (302), each message packet may include initial messages, member serial number, member account and a message serial number.<br>
In the step of listening to a response from a target member card nearby (304), a first duration for listing to the response from a member card nearby may be randomly between 0.1 to 0.5 seconds. If a response is received, an information exchange process is executed. The information exchange process is described later.<br>
In the step of listening to a response from the member card nearby (307), a second duration for listing to the response from the member card nearby may be a result of subtracting the first duration from 0.6 seconds. If a response is received, an information exchange process is executed. Broadcasting and listening twice in 0.6 seconds increases the probability to establish a connection to a neighboring member card.<br>
In the step of switching off the wireless communication unit (308), the processing unit (10) operates in a power consumption mode for 0.4 seconds.<br>
The processing unit (10) monitors the mainframe connection port (11) while executing the above-mentioned broadcast and listen process. If the mainframe connection port (11) is connected to the electronic device such as a<br>
 <br>
computer, the member card is changed to operate in the connection mode.<br>
With further reference to Fig. 5, the foregoing information exchange process comprises steps of exchange the user information (401) (an initial terminal and a feedback terminal respectively represent the information exchange apparatus broadcasting message packets and the target information exchange apparatus hereinafter), receiving a feedback message packet from the feedback terminal to the initial terminal (402), sending an acknowledge message packet from the initial terminal to the feedback terminal (403), determining whether the acknowledge message packet is received by the feedback terminal (404) and accomplishing the information exchange process (406).<br>
In the step of exchange the user information (401), the information exchange process starts up when the member card receives message packets from other member card.<br>

In the step of sending an acknowledge message packet from the initial terminal to the feedback terminal (403), the acknowledge message packet may include acknowledge messages, the member serial number of the feedback terminal, the member account of the feedback terminal, an acknowledge message serial number, the member serial number of the initial terminal and the<br>
 <br>
message serial number of the message packet. When the initial terminal confirms receiving the acknowledge messages, the initial terminal accomplishes the information exchange process, stores a new data exchange record and returns to the broadcast and listen process.<br>
If the step of accomplishing the information exchange process (406), the feedback terminal accomplishes the information exchange process when the feedback terminal receives the acknowledge message packet from the initial terminal. Otherwise, a step of determining whether 0,5 seconds is passed (405) is executed. If 0,5 seconds is passed after the step of determining whether the acknowledge message packet is received by the feedback terminal (404), the step of accomplishing the information exchange process (406) is subsequently executed. The feedback terminal accomplishes the information exchange process, stores a new data exchange record and returns to the broadcast and listen process.<br>
The connection mode is operated when the member card connects to the electronic device such as a computer. In this mode, the processing unit (10) simulates the member card to be a USB mass storage device so application programs on the computer can access the member card by issuing a USB ATAPI command. When the member card first connects to the managing system through the computer, the member card executes an activation process to write the member account and the user information to the member card and set the configuration data.<br>
When the member card connects to the managing system again, the member card executes steps of uploading the data exchange records to the<br>
 <br>
r	i<br>
managing system through the computer and keeping a record of the uploaded data exchange records, and downloading the data exchange records to the storage unit in the member card and keeping a record of the downloaded data exchange records.<br>
When applying the website in the managing system to be a general community website, the website in the managing system comprises a user interface, the database and a back-end processing program.<br>
The database should comprise a member information table, a membership table and a member relationship table. The member information table comprises member serial number, manufacturing date, activation date, hardware version, firmware version and the like of every member. The membership table comprises the member serial number and a corresponding member account of every member. The member relationship table comprises time of each meeting, member serial number, member account, target member account, target member serial number and the like of every member.<br>
If a website function requires interactions, such as uploading or downloading, with the member card, a specially-encoded URL can be returned from the website. When a web browser of the computer opens the URL, the driver installed in the computer intercepts the request and instructs the member card to react.<br>
Further, when logging in the website, the website will require the computer to connect to the member card to enforce exchange data with the member card.<br>
Therefore, the website in the managing system is ensured to have the<br>
 <br>
1<br>
latest data exchange records.<br>
Besides, the present invention can also apply to E-commerce such as one-to-one commercial delivery and sale. At least one information exchange apparatus may be set in a shop, a public place or the like, and a fixed communication spot represents the information exchange apparatus set in a shop, a public place or the like. The fixed communication spot may broadcast wireless signals with a frequency. If required, the member card can be designed to broadcast periodic wireless signals voluntarily.<br>
The member card and the fixed communication spot exchange data with each other when one of them detects the other one. The exchanged data may comprise device ID codes of the member card and the fixed communication spot or the like.<br>
The fixed communication spot is capable of immediately or periodically uploading the user information of connected member card and receiving the latest sale information and commercials.<br>
When the member card is cormected to the computer, the member card will upload the data exchange records to the website of the managing system through the computer and download interested sale information and commercials. The sale information and commercials can also be provided by the fixed communication spot. Therefore, the MMI (50) on the member card notifies the latest sale information and commercials to the user. The website in the managing system analyzes the data exchange records from the member card to obtain useful results.<br>
If a place has muUiple fixed communication spots, a multiple point<br>
 <br>
positioning technique may be applied to the managing system to calculate and track the positions of the members carrying member cards.<br>
Further, the fixed communication spot may provide a coupon code for<br>
the member card to download thereto. When the user shows the member card<br>
\	I<br>
showing the downloaded coupon, the member card represents as an e-coupon.<br>
The coupon code may be issued to a specific member card based on requirement.<br>
The member card may be used as a tool that automatically finds required or interested products or information by inputting interested and required information to the member card. If the member card finds out that the fixed communication spot nearby provides matching products or information, the member card will receive the information from the fixed communication spot and notify it to the user. Alternatively, the managing system can automatically find out matching information, which can be downloaded to the member card when the user logs in to the member website.<br>
In addition, the information exchange apparatus may be incorporated with an existing mobile electronic device such as a cellphone, a Global Positioning System (GPS) device, a notebook computer or the like with capabilities of positioning and wireless network sti the information exchange<br>
h<br>
apparatus fiarther has a positioning capability and a wireless network capability. The positioning capability allows the information exchange apparatus to obtain location coordinates thereof and may be implemented by GPS, assisted GPS (A-GPS), Global System for Mobile Communications-based (GSM-based) location-based service (LBS), Wifi-based LBS or the like. The wireless network capability allows the information exchange apparatus to connect to the Internet<br>
 <br>
and may be implemented by 2G/3G mobile data networks such as General<br>
Packet Radio Service (GPRS), Enhanced Data rates for GSM Evolution (EDGE),<br>
i CDMA IX or wireless LANs such as IEEE 802.1 la^/g, or other wireless<br>
network technologies. The information exchange apparatus obtains the location<br>
coordinates by the positioning capability at set intervals, sends the location<br>
coordinates and data in the storage unit (30) to the Internet and receives<br>
exchanged information from other information exchange apparatus by using the<br>
wireless network capability at set intervals. The intervals mentioned above could<br>
be some fixed time of day, some fixed time duration since last position update,<br>
some fixed time duration since last data exchange with another information<br>
exchange apparatus, or the time when some other pre-programmed condition is<br>
met. Additionally, the managing system further receives the location coordinates<br>
from the information exchange apparatus through the Internet, calculates a<br>
distance between the two information exchange apparatuses from the location<br>
coordinates and data in the storage unit (30) of each information exchange<br>
apparatus. The managing system considers that tlie two information exchange<br>
apparatuses meet when the two information exchange apparatuses are close<br>
enough to each other and exchanges the data in the storage unit (30) of the<br>
information exchange apparatuses if they meet. ,<br>
