				<td>The present invention relates to a digital textile printer, and more particularly a printer performing effectively not only general printing operations to a little thick printing material (textile fabrics or papers) , such as a banner, a advertising material, or a photograph, but also textile printing operations to the very thin printing material, such as textile fabrics.<br>
Description of the Related Art<br>
Generally, in the conventional printer utilizing a technique of subtractive mixture, a digital controller sends digitalized signals to a head of the printer, so that<br>
1<br><br>
PCT/KR2004/002061<br>
RO/KR 01.09.2004<br>
the head may inject proper amounts of ink of three primary colors comprising magenta, yellow, and cyan, and of a black color to a printing material to produce various color tones. Therefore, the latest printer makes it possible for a user to design more easily what she/he wants.<br>
In the technique of subtractive mixture, the head of the printer equips several ink reservoirs, while each ink reservoir contains one color respectively. The head injects proper amounts of ink from each reservoir to produce a new color tone. The head often equips another ink reservoir containing special color to produce a new color tone, if necessary.<br>
By referencing Fig. 1 and Fig. 2, the conventional digital printer will be described briefly in the following statements.<br>
The conventional printer equips a transfer belt 5 with a rail shape on the top of a base 3, while the base 3 is supported by both legs 1 contacting with the ground. The one side of a cartridge 9 is fixed with the transfer belt 5, so that a head 7 of the cartridge 9 can be moved through the transfer belt 5. In more, a transfer axis 50 is connected with a transfer motor (not shown) within a<br>
2<br><br>
PCT/KR2004/002061<br>
RO/KR 01.09.2004<br>
driving panel 18 installed in the one side of the inner upper side of the base 3. Additionally, lots of transfer rollers 51 on the transfer axis 50 are extruded on the top of the base 3 to make a printing, material 17 move to the Forward direction, while a press roller 4 0 equipped correspondingly on the top of each transfer roller 51 presses the printing material 17 to the downward direction.<br>
In more, a feeding roller 11 installed in the rear side of the digital printer supplies the printing material 17 to the top of the base 3. When the cartridge 9 moves reciprocally to the left or the right direction on the top of the. printing material 17, the head 7 moving in combination with the cartridge 9 injects predetermined amounts of each color from the corresponding ink reservoir to perform printing operations. As a result, the printed<br>
material is recoiled in a rewinding roller 12 located on<br>
the opposite side of the feeding roller 11.<br><br>
An operation panel 16 covered by a cover 15 is<br>
equipped on the top of the base 3. Therefore, a user can<br>
input any desirable signal to be printed in the printing<br>
material 17.<br>
In other words, as shown in Fig. 2, the printing<br>
3<br><br>
PCT/KR2004/002061<br>
RO/KR 01.09.2004<br>
material 17 is suspended to the feeding roller 11 in the rear of a fixing frame 10 between the legs 1, and the end of the printing material 17 passes through the top of the base 3 supported by the legs 1. In more, the rewinding roller 12 winding the printing material 17 printed at the base 3 is in the front of the fixing frame 10.<br>
However, the conventional printer described in the above statements has the following problems. After the printing material 17 is put between lots of transfer rollers 51 and press rollers 40, the transfer roller 51 rotates to make the printing material 17 move to the front side of the base 3. When the printing material 17 is extremely thin in the case of textile printing, the speed of the printing material 17 passing through between the transfer rollers 51 and the press rollers 40 is different from that of the printing material 17 before the transfer roller 51. Therefore, a portion of the printing material 17 is often wrinkled, and the wrinkled moving printing material 17 has a tendency of inclining toward one direction only. As a result, when the printing material 17 is distorted or wrinkled, printing colors are overlapped to get high fraction defective of the printing operations.<br>
Additionally, the conventional digital printer does<br>
4<br><br>
PCT/KR2004/002061<br>
RO/KR 01.09,2004<br>
not have a feeding means drawing and rewinding the printing material 17 in constant speed to maintain the printing material 17 in plain. Therefore, the distortion or the<br>
wrinkle of the printing material 17 is deepened more to increase fraction defective of the printing operation.<br><br>
Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
To overcome the above described problems, the present invention provides a digital textile printer comprising the front rewinding and the rear feeding devices, at the front and the rear of the base, driven by a transfer axis in a driving panel, winding a printing material to a rewinding roller in a constant tension force, preventing defective 1 printing operations generated by distorting or wrinkling phenomena of the printing material, and performing effective textile printing to the very thin textile fabrics eventually.<br>
In more, the present invention provides a digital textile printer comprising a long ink-retrieving hole, on the top of the base, collecting the residues of the injected ink passing through the printing material to prevent the printing material from ink contamination or ink<br>

PCT/KR2004/002061<br>
RO/KR 01.09.2004<br>
length of a nozzle hose 230 installed in the one side of the close cap 220 is as long as from the bottom of the inner side of each of the multiple bottom tanks 200 to the printer 500 adjacent to the main body 100. Additionally, in the end of each of the nozzle hoses 230, each of the nozzles 240 connected to the printer 500 is installed.<br>
The six bottom tanks 200 are usually installed, and each of the bottom tanks 200 contains color ink, such as cyan, yellow, magenta, black, light magenta, and light cyan, or specially selected color ink can be charged to the bottom tank 200. Therefore, combination of those colors can discharge various colors.<br>
As shown in Fig. 2, in the case of connecting the end of the nozzle hose 23 0 with the nozzle 24 0 connected with the printer 500, a nozzle cartridge 250 having a same shape of the ink cartridge is generated. Sequentially, an installation groove 251 is generated in a nozzle cartridge 250 to fix the nozzle hose 230 in stable, and the one end of the nozzle cartridge 250 fixes the nozzle 240. In more, the nozzle hose 23 0 installed in the nozzle cartridge 2 50 can be set in the inside of the nozzle cartridge 250.<br>
Each of six top tanks 300 corresponding to the same<br>
13<br><br>
PCT/KR2004/002061<br>
RO/KR 01.09.2004<br>
number of the bottom tanks 200 is installed in and penetrated into each of the supporting holes 141 of the top supporting plate 140, and is supplied by ink having different colors one another. In more, a supply hose 310 with an O/C (open/close) valve 320 is connected with the bottom of the top tank 300, and the bottom end of the supply hose 310 is prolonged to a predetermined height of the inside of the bottom tank 200 to maintain the amount of ink constantly, as shown in Fig. 4. Additionally, the top side of the top tank 300 comprises an O/C cover 330 receiving ink from the outside. The O/C valve 320 is exposed to the opening 110 in the front side of the main body 100 so that the O/C valve 320 can be controlled from the outside.<br>
In more, the supply hose 310 positioned in the inside of the top tank 3 00 comprises a filter unit 34 0 filtering a foreign substance within the injected ink. The filter unit 340 has a minute size (about 10 µm) to prevent a water passage, and the ink is slowly passed by the surface tension and is supplied into the bottom tank 200.<br>
On the contrary, in the bottom of the main body 10 0, a supporting rod 40 0 adjusting the height to fit on the height of the printer 500 is installed in a predetermined<br>
14<br><br>
PCT/KR2004/002061<br>
RO/KR 01.09.2004<br>
distance apart. The supporting rod 400 comprises two top supporting rods 410 in the bottom of the main body 100 in a distance, and a bottom supporting rod 42 0 is prepared and guided into the inside of each of the top supporting rods 410. In more, with the bottom side of the bottom supporting rod 420, a base plate 430 supporting the bottom supporting rod 420 in stable is connected.<br>
Additionally, the one side of the two top supporting rods 410 comprises a fixing bolt 411, corresponding to the bottom supporting rod 420, to combine two supporting rod 410 and 420 in stable, and the base plate 430 comprises multiple casters 440 moving the main body 100 conveniently and easily.<br>
In more, an elevating mean 4 50 lifting up and down the main body is installed between the supporting rods 400. The elevating mean 450 comprises a screw rod 451, a screw axis 453, and an adjusting handle 454. The screw rod 451 is placed in the center of the bottom of the main body 100 and the screw axis 453 is placed in the center of the base plate 430 rotating in the inside of the screw rod 451 in a fixed position to lift up and down the • screw rod 451. In more, the adjusting handle 454 makes the rotation of the .<br>
15<br><br>
PCT/KR2004/002061<br>
RO/KR 01.09.2004<br>
screw axis 453 easy. In other words, when the adjusting handle 454 is rotated, the screw axis 453 is rotated in a fixed position to lift up and down the screw rod 451, and the top supporting rod 410 is lifted up and down in stable from the bottom supporting rod 420 placed in both sides of the base plate 430.<br>
Function and effects of the automatic ink supply device shown in the above will be described in the following statements.<br>
At first, the automatic ink supply device is moved to the one side of the printer 500. In this case, the automatic ink supply device is moved easily because the caster 44 0 is installed in the bottom side of the base plate 430.<br>
After moving the automatic ink supply device to	the<br>
one side of the printer 500, the nozzle cartridge	250<br>
combined with the nozzle hose 230 is installed in	the<br>
cartridge chamber (not shown) in the one side of	the<br>
printer 500, and the height of the main body 100 is<br>
adjusted. It is because ink supply to the printer is	not<br>
performed well when the height of the main body 100 is	less<br>
than that of printer 500.<br>
16<br><br>
PCT/KR2004/002061<br>
RO/KR 01.09.2004<br>
To adjust the height of the main body 100, the fixing bolt 411 of the one side of the top supporting rod 410 is loosed to release the end of the fixing bolt 411 from the bottom supporting rod 420. Sequentially, the adjusting handle 454 is rotated in the one direction to rotate the screw axis 453 in a fixed position. In this case, the screw rod 451 and both top supporting rods 410 are lifted up due to the rotation of the screw axis 453. In more, the top side of the main body 100 is also lifted up adequately to match on the height of the printer 500. After adjusting the height of the main body 100, the fixing bolt 411 of the one side of the top supporting rod 410 is tightened to contact the end of the fixing bolt 411 with the bottom supporting rod 410 and to prevent the lift-up main body 100 from moving.<br>
After adjusting the height of the main body 100 adequately, the body cover 120 installed in the top side of the main body 100 is opened. In this case, the body cover 120 is opened and supported by the rear hinge 121.<br>
When the body cover 120 is opened, the O/C cover 330 of the top tank 300, normally six arranged inline, is opened and each of the top tanks 3 00 is charged with<br>
17<br><br>
PCT/KR2004/002061<br>
RO/KR 01.09.2004<br>
different color inks one another, such as cyan, yellow, magenta, black, light magenta, and light cyan.<br>
The ink charged in the inside of the top tank 300 is supplied to the bottom tank 200 through the supply hose 310 toy the surface tension. In this case, the open states of the O/C valve 320 installed in the supply hose 310 are maintained. Because the filter unit 340 is installed in the supply hose 310 placed in the inside of the top tank 300, a foreign substance within the ink or a lump of ink larger than a standard size (about 10 µm) is filtered to prevent closing of the nozzle 240 during the printing process.<br>
As shown in Fig. 4, an atmospheric pressure is exerted to the ink supplied from the bottom tank 200 through the supply hose 310 prolonged to the inside of the bottom tank 200. Therefore, the height of the ink within the bottom tank 200 is maintained constantly, and the amount of the ink consumed in the bottom tank 200 is refilled from the top tank 300.<br>
When the ink of the top tank 3 00 is consumed completely, the O/C valve 320 installed in the supply hose 310 is closed through the opening 110 in the front side of the main body 100, and adequate amount of ink is refilled<br>
18<br><br>
PCT/KR2004/002061 RO/KR 01.09.2004<br>
to the top tank 300. Sequentially, the O/C valve 320 is opened again. When ink is refilled to the top tank 300 in the state of opening the O/C value 320, the difference of an atmospheric pressure is generated, in the inside of the bottom tank 200. Therefore, such phenomena rises up the ink level in the inside of the bottom tank 200, and makes the amount of discharged ink through the nozzle 24 0 different to generate low printing quality.<br>
As shown in the above statements, the automatic ink supply device of the present invention provides has a minimized volume to be installed easily. In more, the top tank and the bottom tank can supply ink continuously, while the bottom tank is connected with each of the multiple nozzle hoses and the top tank is connected with the bottom Itank through the supply hose. Therefore, printing efficiency is maximized and supplying ink from the outside is performed easily.<br>
Additionally, the height of the automatic ink supply device of the present invention can be adjusted in free to match on any height of the printer. In more, the filter unit installed in the inside of the top tank charged by ink from the outside filters a foreign substance or a lump of<br>
19<br><br>
PCT/KR2004/002061<br>
