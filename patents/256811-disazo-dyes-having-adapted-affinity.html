				<td>Dyes having adapted affinity<br>
This invention relates to reactive dye mixtures, their preparation and use lor dyeing or printing fibre materials, including in particular by ink jet processes. The invention further relates to dye mixtures for the trichromatic dyeing process containing the novel reactive dye mixtures and processes for their use.<br>
Trichromatic dyeing is well known from fee literature for different classes of dyes, for example from EP 83 299, DE 2623178, EP 226 982 and EP 808 940.<br>
The dyeing and printing of cotton and cellulosic materials requires dyes or dye mixtures which have an adapted affinity and which also provide good wash-off with regard to unfixed portions. They shall further possess a high reactivity, so that only brief dwell times are needed, and they shall provide in particular dyeings having high degrees of fixation.<br>
The novel dyes should be notable in particular for high fixation yields and high fibre- dye bond stabilities and, moreover, portions not fixed to the fibre should be easy to wash off.<br>
They should further provide dyeings having good all-round fastnesses, for example light _ and wet fastnesses.		<br>
The dyes to be used in the process shall exhibit a uniform colour build-up in a constant hue at various concentrations.<br>
Reactive dyes having two (or more) sulphatoethyl sulphone reactive groups that, in an exhaust process, have little affinity for fibre before alkali is added but will suddenly go onto the fibre after alkali has been added may lead to sketchy or unlevel dyeings in the exhaust process. Such dyes are difficult to combine in trichromatic dyeings with further trichromatic partners of medium and high affinity.<br>
The present invention therefore had for its object to find novel, improved reactive dyes or reactive dye mixtures which possess the above-characterized qualities to a high degree.<br>
It has been determined that the mixtures according to the invention, of defined novel bireactive dye mixtures, achieve the stated object<br>
The invention accordingly provides mixtures containing compounds of formula 1<br><br>
or mixtures of compounds of formula 1 where<br>
Ri isRSCbH,<br>
R2 is H, SO3H<br>
Xi is CH=CH2, CH2CH20SO3H<br>
X2 _ is CH=CH2 . CHzCHzOSOjH^<br>
characterized in that the fraction of the compound Id<br><br>
in the mixtures as per formula 1 is more than 40 %.<br>
Dye 1 according to the invention and mixtures of such dyes are suitable as a blue component for the trichromatic dyeing process. The dye Id according to the inventionis particularly suitable as blue components for the trichromatic dyeing process.<br>
Preferred mixtures containing mixtures of compounds as per formula 1 the mixture of the compounds as per formula 1 comprises more than 50% of the compound as per formula Id <br>
where<br>
R, isH,S03H, R2 is H, SO3H Xi is CH=CH2, CH2CH20S03H X2 is CH=CH2, CH2CH20S03H.<br>
Dye mixtures suitable for dyeing by the trichromatic process contain dyes as per fee formula 1 as blue elements together with at least one red or reddish brown dyeing component and at least one yellow or orange dyeing component<br>
The inventive compounds and mixtures of compounds are suitable for dyeing or printing hydroxyl- or nitrogen-containing organic substrates.<br>
As per another aspect of the invention there is accordingly provided a process for dyeing or printing hydroxyl- or nitrogen-containing organic substrates wherein dyeing or printing is carried out wife fee above-defined compounds or mixtures.<br>
It should be noted that any reference to compounds or mixtures in fee plural shall also be construed as a reference to a compound or a mixture in fee singular, and vice versa. Any reference to printing techniques always comprehends as well as fee classic processes the more recent printing processes such as for example fee ink jet printing —process.	 			 			 	<br>
Preferred substrates are leather and fibre materials which comprise natural or synthetic polyamides and especially natural or regenerated cellulose, such as cotton, filament viscose or staple viscose. The most preferred substrate is textile material comprising cotton-<br>
As per another aspect of fee present invention there is provided for fee use of fee above- defined compounds, their salts or mixtures for dyeing or printing fee above-described substrates.<br>
The compounds of the formula 1 can be used in dyeing liquors or in print pastes according to all dyeing or printing processes customary for reactive dyes. Preference is given to dyeing by the exhaust process in the temperature range of40-70°C.<br>
The compounds as per the invention can be used as individual dyes or, on account of their good compatibility, also as a combination element with other reactive dyes of the same class which possess comparable dyeing properties, such as for example their general fastnesses, their exhaustion and fixation yield, etc. The combination-shade dyeings obtained are as fast as the dyeings with the individual dye. Especially the dyes of the formula 1 are suitable as a blue trichromatic element<br>
The compounds of the formula X give good exhaustion and fixation yields. The unfixed dye portion is readily washed off. The dyeings and {Hints obtained exhibit good light fastness. They additionally exhibit good wet fastness properties for example with regard to washing, water, seawater and perspiration fastness and have good stability to oxidative influences such as to chlorinated water, hypochlorite bleach, peroxide bleach and also to perborate- and percarbonate-containing laundry detergents including especially those containing bleach activators, such as TAED etc.<br>
As per a further aspect of the present invention there is provided a hydroxyl- or nitrogen-containing organic substrate which has been dyed or printed as per the above- . described dyeing orprintingprpcess, includingJhe ink jetprintingprocess.		<br>
The present invention likewise provides substrates, especially cellulose, polyamides and animal fibres, preferably cotton, that have been dyed with such compounds.<br>
The invention likewise provides for the use of a compound of the formula (I) or mixtures thereof as a component in an ink jet printing ink. The invention further provides ink jet printing inks comprising mixtures according to the formula (I) or mixtures thereof. Such printing inks can be produced using various organic solvents and their mixtures, such as for example alcohols, ethers, esters, nitriles, carboxamides, cyclic amides, urea, sulphones and sulphone oxides.<br>
Inkjet inks generally contain in total 0.5 to 35% by weight and preferably 1.5 to 15% by weight (reckoned dry) of one or more of the compounds according to the invention.<br>
The process for producing the dye mixtures as per the formula 1 according to the invention comprises the following steps: The diazonium salt (4) is coupled under acid conditions onto l-amino-8-hydroxynaphthalene-3,6-<tisulphonic acid to form the monoazo dye hie then has diazonium salt coupled onto it under neutral conditions la.></tisulphonic>
The compound (la) is the bis-sulphatoethylsulphonyl reactive dye described in	<br>
Example 1 of the patent specification CH 657 865 A5.<br>
There are synthetic reasons why technical grades of the dye of fee dye la will generally contain a 5-10% fraction of C.I. Reactive Black 5 (cf. formula 2a). Since fee dye CX Reactive Black 5 has distinctly worse fastnesses than the dye la, the fraction of 2a (CX Reactive Black 5) should be minimized by suitable measures and it is for example advantageous in fee synthesis of the dye of fee formula la to keep the excess of fee diazo component 4, which is customarily about 5-15% with regard to 1-amino-8- hydroxynaphthalene-3,6-disulphonic acid (5), to a minimum.<br><br>
Treatment of fee dye of fee formula la wife different amounts of a strong base such as an alkali metal hydroxide for example gives mixtures containing fee dyes of fee formulae la, lb, lc and Id. The amount of base added is between 1.3 and 2.4 "equivalents;						 	 <br>
The mixtures produced by addition of 1.5-2 equivalents of a strong base such as sodium hydroxide contain the bis(vinyl sulphone) dye of the formula Id as a main component Such mixtures exhibit distinctly increased affinity over the original dye la in the salt phase of an exhaust dyeing process (prior to the addition of alkali in the dyeing process). In addition, these dye mixtures are veiy suitable for trichromatic dyeings with yellow/orange and red/brown elements. Despite the distinctly increased affinity, the dye mixtures according to the invention still exhibit good solubilities. <br>
It will be appreciated that the dye 2a which may be present in the technical grade batches of the dye la will react with alkali in a similar manner to the dye la. An alkali treatment of the dye 2a gives rise to the dyes of the structures 2b, 2c and consequently<br>

When 2-amino-5-(2'-sulphatoethylsulphonylbenzenesulphonic acid is prepared by sulphonation of 4-aminophenyl 2'-sulphatoethyl sulphone, as described in the patent 10 specification DE 2538723, the dyes of the structures 3a and 3b will likewise be<br>
detectable in small amounts in the reaction mixture.<br><br>
