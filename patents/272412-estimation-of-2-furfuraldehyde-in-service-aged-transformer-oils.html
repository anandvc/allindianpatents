				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION:<br>
This invention relates to a process for the estimation of 2-furfuraldehyde in<br>
transformer oils.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION:<br>
Electrical power transformers play an important role in power distribution system.<br>
In many types of transformers, cellulose based paper and board are used which<br>
serve as dielectric insulation for the electrical windings. The windings are<br>
supported on a core, which is immersed in insulating oil. For safe and reliable<br>
operation of the transformer, it is necessary to monitor, the quality of insulation<br>
by regularly testing the oil and paper.<br>
During the operation of a transformer, thermal degradation of insulation paper<br>
occurs as a natural process. Insulation paper in the transformer is subjected to<br>
thermal oxidation and hydrolytic degradation. This will result in chain scission of<br>
cellulose and reduction of degree of polymerization (DP) values, resulting in the<br>
formation of CO, CO2 and furan derivatives such as 5-Hydroxy methyl 2-<br>
furfuraldehyde, 2-furfurylalcohol, 2-furoic acid, 3-furoic acid, 2-furfurylmethyl<br>
Ketone, 5-methyl 2-furfuraldehyde and 2-furfuraldehyde [1,2]. Measuring the DP<br>
value of cellulose or determining the level of by products formed on aging are<br>
discussed in [3,4]. The method involved in the measurement of DP-value of<br>
insulating paper is quite laborious and time consuming, further it is not possible<br>
to measure DP value at site to know the condition of transformer insulation. The<br>
relative amounts of CO, CO2 and other gases evolved as by products are<br><br>
determined by Gas Chromatography (GC) to identify the faults inside the<br>
transformer [5-6]. However, because of the interference of the background level<br>
of gasses that are generally present in aged transformer oils, interpretation of the<br>
results obtained by GC is difficult and the condition of the cellulose insulation<br>
cannot be predicted. On-line GC has been attempted but it has not been<br>
successful for detecting the 2-furfuraldehyde content at early stages [7], i.e. there<br>
is a limitation in the detection limits. Direct estimation of furfural derivatives by<br>
Ultra Violet (UV) spectrophotometric method is not possible, as all these<br>
derivatives absorb UV radiation in the region 200-300 nm due to -* and n-<br>
transitions. Among the furan derivatives, 2-furfuraldehyde is identified as the<br>
most critical compound which is having direct correlation with DP of paper. The<br>
absorption maxima of 2-furfuraldehyde is at 270 nm which is very close to other<br>
furfural derivatives. Hence it is difficult to estimate 2-furfuraldehyde in transformer<br>
oil in presence of other furfural derivatives by UV method. High performance<br>
Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) is the current method being used for the<br>
detection of 2-furfuraldehyde (FFA) and its derivatives in aged transformer oil<br>
[8.9]. It is quite accurate but requires lengthy extraction procedure and it is not<br>
suitable for field testing. Presently, the furfural derivatives as estimated by IEC-<br>
61198 method is quite laborious and time consuming.<br>
Apart from the open literature, www.uspto.gov site has been searched for patents<br>
with a search string 'furfuraldehyde' AND 'transformer oil'. Two patents available<br>
on this subject are discussed below.<br>
1.	Patent No. 5, 646,047- 'Method and reagent kit for determining paper<br>
degredation in transformers' and<br>
2.	Patent No. 6, 235, 532- 'Furfuraldehyde detector and method of<br>
manufacturing the same'.<br><br>
Patent No. 5, 646,047- This invention pertains to a method and apparatus for<br>
detecting the degree of degradation of paper insulation in a transformer by<br>
determining the concentration of furfuraldehyde in transformer oil. This invention<br>
uses halogenated hydrocarbons as solvents which are toxic and health hazard.<br>
It was an object of 'Patent No. 6,235,532 'Furfuraldehyde detector and method of<br>
manufacturing the same' to mitigate or obviate one or more of the above<br>
disadvantages. This invention uses porous solid sensor comprising aniline<br>
acetate entrapped in sol-gel inert matrix. Preparation of the sol-gel is<br>
cumbersome and time consuming. The invention is silent about determination of<br>
FFA in high aromatic paraffinic oils. Minimum concentration of FFA that can be<br>
determined by this method has not been claimed. Also, in presence of other<br>
furfuraldehyde derivatives, the accuracy of estimation of 2-FFA and their<br>
interference has not been discussed.<br>
Present Status:<br>
The current practice involves periodically collecting samples of oil from the<br>
transformer or transformers to be tested, transporting the samples to a<br>
laboratory, usually remote from the transformers, and analysing the samples<br>
using an extraction process with solvents like Acetonitrile, Methanol and Water<br>
and analyzing the extracted furfural derivatives by HPLC following the procedure<br>
as given in IEC-61198. The reagents used during the chemical analysis (and the<br>
fumes produced) are toxic if ingested and therefore great care must be taken<br>
during the laboratory chemical analysis.<br>
Present practices therefore do not enable an on-the-spot assessment (or<br>
estimate) of the state of the paper insulation via FFA measurements to be made.<br>
The analysis is conducted in a chemical laboratory, sometimes days after the oil<br>
samples were actually collected from the transformers. And also, the analysis is<br><br>
slow and expensive. The effect of this delay may sometimes lead to failure<br>
transformers.<br>
Short comings present in the existing prior art are summarized below.<br>
1.0 Methods adopted lack accuracy in determining the 2-furfuraldehyde content<br>
and in situ measurement is not possible.<br>
2.0 Procedures involved are lengthy, cumbersome and time consuming. Also, the<br>
solvents recommended were halogenated hydrocarbons which are toxic and<br>
health hazard.<br>
3.0 Detection limits of 2-furfuraldehyde content is limited.<br>
4.0 As furfural is light sensitive and if the oil is exposed to light, or storage for a<br>
long duration, there is a possibility of change in concentration leading to<br>
erroneous estimation.<br>
5.0 Accuracy of estimation of 2-FFA in presence of other furfuraldehyde<br>
derivatives, and their interference has not been discussed.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION:<br>
An object of this invention is to propose a process for the estimation of 2-<br>
furfuraldehyde in transformer oils;<br>
Another, object of this invention is to propose a reliable technique for direct<br>
determination of 2-furfuraldehyde;<br>
Further, object of this invention is to propose a process for the estimation of 2-<br>
furfuraldehyde with accuracy;<br><br>
Still further object of this invention is to propose a process for the estimation of 2-<br>
furfuraldehyde from the transformer oil without using the cellulose paper.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION:<br>
According to this invention there is provided a method for the estimation of 2<br>
furfuraldehyde in transform oils comprising:<br>
adding glacial acetic acid and aniline to the transformer oil to form a pink<br>
coloured complex at 20Â°C.<br>
The main object of the present invention is to ovecome the difficulties<br>
encountered in the earlier literature, in estimating the furfuraldehyde content in<br>
transformer oils.<br>
The invention is reliable technique for direct determination of 2-furfuraldehyde in<br>
service aged transformer oil using prototype spectrophotometer, which has been<br>
applied for field-testing. The transformer oils used in India are high aromatic<br>
content (20%) paraffinic oils and also have high sulphur content to the extent of<br>
1.5%. However, this technique can also be applied for determining the 2-FFA in<br>
Naphthenic oils with optimum aromatic content (8%). Minimum concentration of<br>
2-FFA that can be determined by this method in presence of other<br>
furfuraldehydes to a level of 0.05 mg/ltr with a relative standard deviation of<br>
0.24%. The present spectrophotometric method relies on the specific reaction<br>
between FFA and the compound aniline acetate which yields a complex with a<br>
bright pink colour, the intensity of which is a characteristic which can be<br>
measured photo-optically and which correlates with the concentration of FFA in<br>
the transformer oil.<br><br>
In the present invention, a direct rapid spectrophotometric method has been<br>
developed for estimation of 2-furfuraldehyde(2-furfural) in transformer oil at about<br>
20Â°C by formation of pink coloured complex with aniline acetate having maximum<br>
absorption at 526 nm. The bathochromic shift of maximum absorption of 2<br>
furfural at 270 nm to 526 nm after forming the complex is due to ring opening and<br>
also due to increase of electron conjugation in the system.<br>
Different experiments were conducted with different ratios of aniline and glacial<br>
acetic acid and it is found that the absorption at 526 nm of the complex is highest<br>
when distilled aniline and glacial acetic acid were used in the ratio of 1:9 (v/v).<br><br><br>
The absorption is directly proportional to molar concentration and obeys Beer-<br>
Lambert's law. The effect of path length on the absorption 2-FFA with Aniline-<br>
Acetic acid complex at 526 nm was also studied and found that the absorption of<br>
2-furfural complex increases with increase in path length of cell. A path length of<br>
2.5 cm. which is ideal is chosen for the present invention.<br><br>
The effect of temperature on the stability of the complex was also studied and<br>
found that at 20Â°C the absorption of 2-furfural-aniline-acetate complex is<br>
maximum and more stable compared to higher temperatures. The complex<br>
stability time is dependant on the concentration of 2-furfural present in the oil, viz.<br>
0.5 minutes for a concentration of 0.05 mg/ltr and 2.5 minutes for a concentration<br>
of 10 mg/ltr.<br><br><br>
The interference of other furan derivatives were determined quantitatively by<br>
treating the blank transformer oils with these individual compounds and<br>
developing the complex with aniline glacial acetic acid under identical conditions.<br>
It was found that 2-furoic acid, 3-furoic acid and 2-furfuryl methyl ketone do not<br>
form any complex, whereas 5-hydroxy methyl-2-furfurldehyde (5-HM 2-FFA), 5-<br>
methyl 2-furfuraldehyde (5-M 2-FFA), and 2-furfurylalcohol developed complex of<br>
negligible intensity as compared to 2-furfuraldehyde. Table-4 gives the<br>
percentage absorption of above mentioned derivatives at 526 nm. From the<br>
table, it is clear that the absorption of 2-FFA complex is maximum and is 150<br>
times greater than other FFA substitutes, which indicate negligible absorption<br>
values.<br><br><br><br>
Experiments were conducted to see the effect of aniline reagent quality on the<br>
absorption value at a maximum wave length of 526 nm. Table-5 gives the values<br>
of absorption at different concentrations of 2-FFA with distilled and undistilled<br>
Aniline.<br><br>
Different experiments were also conducted to study the effect of reference<br>
(blank) on the absorption values. Consistent maximum absorption values with<br>
aniline glacial acetic acid reagent were obtained with laboratory aged transformer<br>
oil matching with the colour of the service aged sample oil. Compared to<br>
naphthenic oils, fresh paraffinic based transformer oils available in India are<br>
yellowish or yellowish orange in colour. Service aged transformers oils are mostly<br>
brownish or dark brownish in colour and hence it was necessary to generate<br><br>
blank oils used for calibration and reference by laboratory ageing the fresh oil in<br>
accelerated environment till the colour matches with the sample oil. The effect of<br>
different compositions of reference solutions on absorption of 2-FFA is also<br>
studied. Four solutions containing different propositions of aniline, acetic acid,<br>
toluene and transformer oil (aged and fresh) have been prepared. The<br>
compositions are shown as R1, R2, R3, and R4. The different compositions of<br>
reference solutions are given in table -6. The effect of different compositions of<br>
reference solutions on the absorption values of 2-FFA complex is given in table-<br>
7. It is observed that the absorption values containing aged transformer values<br>
are found to be consistent and sensitive to even trace levels of 2-FFA in oil.<br><br><br><br>
In the present invention a portable spectrophotometer equipped with 2.5cm path<br>
length cell was used. The pink color complex was formed by adding 10 ml<br>
solution mixture of distilled aniline and glacial acetic acid in 1:9 ratio and 5 ml of<br>
service aged transformer oil sample and 10 ml of spectral grade toluene. The<br>
optical density of this solution was recorded at 526 nm at temp 20Â°C with<br>
reference solution prepared as above. Calibration curve was generated by using<br>
synthetic mixture containing 2-furfuraldehyde(distilled) in laboratory aged<br>
transformer oil in the concentration range of 0.05-10 mg/liter (oil aged with out<br>
cellulose paper) having the same colour as the service aged sample oil. The<br>
values estimated in synthetic blends were determined as per the developed<br>
procedure and the percentage error is calculated (Table-8)<br><br><br>
The correlation constant determined was 0.9964. The minimum detection limit of<br>
2FFA in transformer oil was found to be 0.05mg/L with RSD 0.24%. The<br>
comparative values of 2-Furfuraldehyde determined by the standard I EC method<br>
and the developed method based on Aniline-Acetic Acid complex was found to<br>
be matching for different site transformer oils. The comparative values are given<br>
in Table-9<br><br>
A portable kit comprising aniline and glacial acetic acid can be used at the test<br>
site to determine 2-FFA instantaneously in the sample oil.<br><br>
