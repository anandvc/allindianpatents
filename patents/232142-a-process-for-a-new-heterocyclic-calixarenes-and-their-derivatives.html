				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION:<br>
The present invention relates to a new heterocyclyl calixarenes and a process of preparation thereof.<br>
Particularly, the invention relates to a process for preparation of heterocyclyl calixarenes represented by the expression heterocylyl calix[n]arenes and their derivatives, wherein 'n' represents phenolic units and is equal to 4, 6, 8 or 10. More particularly it relates to preparation of heterocylyl calyx[n]arenes, wherein 'n' is equal to 6 or 8. Specifically the arenes and their derivatives find application in extraction and recovery of metal ions from the industrial waste. Additionally, the said arenes after recovery of metal ions can be recovered and reused.<br>
In  accordance  with  the  process  of the  present  invention,   debutylated calix(n)arenes are used as a starting material. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION:<br>
The loss of metal ions in the industrial wastes is the problem, which makes the industrial process not only cumbersome but also expensive. This problem is more damaging when the metal ions are expensive, particularly transition metal ions and are available in scarcity or their processing is possible only by difficult methodology.<br>
In view of above difficulties a great emphasis has been given to develop the processes for extraction and recovery of metal ions from the industrial wastes.<br><br>
The present invention is a step towards the development of products, which can be used in any of such processes.<br>
The term Calixarenes is chosen to describe the shape of the cylic tetramers when they assume that it is present in cone confirmation and extended to be applied to all those compounds from phenols and resorcinols even where calix is no longer of descriptive shape ("Calixarenes a versatile class of macrocyclic compounds"- Editors: J. Vicens and V. Bohmer 1991).<br>
Originally macrocyclic compounds capable of assuming a basket (or "calix") shaped conformation. They are formed from p-hydrocarbyl phenols and formaldehyde. The term now applies to a variety of derivatives by substitution of the hydrocarbon cyclo{oligo[(l,3-phenylene) methylene]}. C. D. Gutsche, Calixarenes, The Royal Society of Chemistry, 1989.<br>
(Formula Removed)<br><br>
Thus, calix[n]arenes are phenolic macrocyclic metacyclophanes that possess a cavity in their molecular structure [Calixarenes: A Versatile Class of Macrocyclic Compounds, 1991 and Calixarenes, Royal Society of Chemistry, Cambridge, 1989]. The dimensions of this cavity in the Calix[n]arenes can be varied by varying the value of n', which indicates the number of phenolic units. Such variation of cavity in calix[n]arenes<br><br>
can be affected by easy executable experimental conditions [Tetrahedron, 1993, 49, 8933]. The method of varying the dimensions of this cavity in calyx[n]arenes is known in the art [Calixarenes: A Versatile Class of Macrocyclic Compounds, 1991; Calixarenes, Royal Society of Chemistry, Cambridge, 1989; Tetrahedron, 1993, 49, 8933; Chem. Rev., 1998, 98, 2495; Chem. Rev., 1997, 97, 1713; Chem. Int. Ed.Engl., 1995, 34, 713].<br>
Despite distinct possible applications very little work has been reported on the synthesis and applications of heterocyclyl calix[n]arenes. The parent calix[n]arenes are known to be inefficient ion extractants {Tetrahedron, 1993, 49, 8933], but some of the derivatives of calix[n]arenes have been determined to exert specific responses to barium, calcium and alkali metal ions.<br>
ADVANTAGES OF THE PRESENT INVENTION:<br>
The present invention is particularly a step towards the disclosure of a process for preparation of series of new heterocyclyl calix[n]arenes, wherein n represents phenolic units and the units present are 4,6,8 &amp;10. Further, in case of the heterocyclyl calyx(n)arenas, the heterocyclic groups are connected through carbon carbon linkages. The title compounds can function as efficient extractants for metal ions, particularly transition metal ions from the industrial wastes in order to make the overall process more economical by affecting the recovery of such metal ions, particularly transition metal ions.<br><br>
The new heterocyclyl calix[n]arenes being reported in the presently disclosed invention are, particularly, useful for extraction of silver, calcium, magnesium, barium, lead, copper and zinc, and precious metals in addition to alkali metals like sodium, potassium and caesium from acidic solutions.<br>
The advantage of the present invention is that, the heterocyclyl calix[n]arenes synthesized in accordance to the presently disclosed invention, are suitable for extraction and recovery of large number of metal ions, as stated here in above.<br>
Further advantage of the present invention is that the heterocyclyl calix[n]arenes can be recovered after recovery of the metal ion, for reuse, hence results in more economic process of recovery of the metal ions from the industrial wastes.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE PRESENT INVENTION:<br>
The main object of the present invention is to disclose new heterocyclyl calix[n]arenes and their derivatives, wherein the heterocyclic group is linked through carbon carbon linkages, which are suitable for extraction of metal ions, particularly of silver, calcium, magnesium, barium, lead, copper and zinc and precious metals in addition to alkali metals like sodium, potassium and caesium.<br>
Other object is to produce heterocylyl calix[n]arenes and their derivatives, wherein 'n' represents phenolic units and is equal to 4, 6, 8 or 10, particularly, 'n' is equal to 6 or 8.<br><br>
Further object of the present invention is to make a complete disclosure of a process for preparation of series of new heterocyclyl calix[n]arenes. Yet    another    object    of   the    present    invention    is    to    disclose   new heterocyclyl calix[n]arenes and their derivatives, which can be recovered and reused after recovery of the metal ions.
