				<td>Description<br>
Coupling electrode for capacitive voltage tapping within the<br>
insulating body of a bushing or of a post insulator<br>
The invention relates to a coupling electrode for capacitive<br>
voltage tapping within an insulating body of a component which<br>
has at least one conductor section which is embedded in the<br>
insulating body and to which a high-voltage potential can be<br>
applied, having an electrode section which is composed of a<br>
semiconductive plastic, and having a connecting element which<br>
is electrically connected to the electrode section and is<br>
designed such that it can be removed from the insulating body.<br>
The invention also relates to a component having at least one<br>
conductor section to which a high-voltage potential can be<br>
applied and having an insulating body which is made of<br>
insulating material and in which each conductor section is<br>
embedded.<br>
A coupling electrode such as this and a component such as this<br>
are already known from EP 0 400 491 A2. The coupling electrode<br>
disclosed there has an annular electrode section composed of a<br>
semiconductive plastic. A connecting element in the form of a<br>
connecting pin is integrally formed on the electrode section<br>
such that an electrically conductive connection is formed<br>
between the connecting pin and the electrode section. The<br>
component disclosed there has an insulating body, in which said<br>
coupling electrode is embedded. In this case, the connecting<br>
element is passed out of the insulating body, so that the<br>
potential on the electrode section can be tapped off at the<br>
connecting element by means of expedient connecting plugs. In<br>
this case, the annular electrode section surrounds a conductor<br>
section, which likewise<br><br>
extends through the insulating body, with the conductor section and the<br>
electrode section being arranged coaxially with respect to one another. The<br>
described component is used as a so-called bushing for high-voltage and<br>
medium-voltage purposes. During operation, the conductor section has a high-<br>
voltage potential applied to it, with the coupling electrode being used as a<br>
capacitive divider element, across which a potential which is proportional to the<br>
high-voltage potential is produced and by means of which the voltage on the<br>
conductor section can be tracked. The already known coupling electrode and the<br>
already known component have the disadvantage that, during the production of<br>
the insulating body for the component, the coupling electrode must be<br>
positioned on the connecting element in a complex manner. Furthermore, such<br>
retention of the coupling electrode during the casting process is susceptible to<br>
faults, so that measurement inaccuracies can occur.<br>
The invention is based on the object of providing a coupling electrode and a<br>
component of the type mentioned initially which costs little, while allowing<br>
accurate alignment of the coupling electrode within the cast insulating body.<br>
A coupling electrode for capacitive voltage tapping within an insulating body of a<br>
component, the component having a conductor section embedded in the<br>
insulating body, configured to carry a high-voltage potential, the coupling<br>
electrode comprising an electrode section composed of a semiconductive plastic;<br>
a connecting element electrically connected to said electrode section and<br>
configured to be electrically contacted from outside the insulating body; and a<br><br>
holder of non-conductive material connected to said electrode section, said<br>
holder having positioning devices enabling said electrode section to be supported<br>
with insulated mounting, said holder comprising a holding ring connected to said<br>
electrode section and an outer ring section and said electrode section being<br>
clamped on said outer ring section.<br>
The invention achieves this object by a holder which is composed of a non-<br>
conductive materials, is connected to the electrode section and has the<br>
positioning means, which allow isolated mounting of the electrode section.<br>
According to the invention, the coupling electrode has a non-conductive holder.<br>
According to the invention, because the holder is non-conductive, it is possible<br>
for the coupling electrode to be brought into contact by means of the positioning<br>
means of the holder with, for example,	<br><br>
an area of the component which will be at ground potential<br>
during subsequent use, without this having any negative affect<br>
on the electrical characteristics of the coupling electrode.<br>
This results in the positioning of the coupling electrode and<br>
the formation of an electrical connecting point being<br>
separated, according to the invention.<br>
The insulating body is expediently composed of cast resin. The<br>
chosen semiconductive plastic from which the electrode section<br>
is made and the cast resin have a similar coefficient of<br>
thermal expansion, so that this avoids mechanical stresses<br>
being produced within the insulating body when major<br>
temperature changes occur.<br>
A connecting plug is expediently provided which is connected to<br>
a conductor and can be pushed onto the connecting element. This<br>
allows the coupling electrode to be detachably connected to<br>
other electronic appliances, for example protective appliances.<br>
According to one expedient further development relating to<br>
this, sealing means are provided and are designed to hold the<br>
connecting plug in the insulating body. The sealing means are,<br>
for example, arranged in the insulating body of the component,<br>
before the insertion of the connecting plug. The connecting<br>
plug is then simply inserted subsequently into the component,<br>
and is pushed onto the sealing means in the process. The<br>
sealing means not only allow simple electrical connection of<br>
the coupling electrode but also electrical isolation of the<br>
connecting plug in the component. Furthermore, the sealing<br>
means prevent the ingress of moisture or other contamination.<br>
Within the scope of the invention, it is, of course, also<br>
possible for the sealing means to be attached to the<br><br>
connecting plug before this is inserted into the insulating<br>
body.<br>
In one expedient further development in this context, the<br>
sealing means are composed of an elastomer. The elastomer is<br>
advantageously an insulating material. According to the<br>
invention, there is no need for the subsequent encapsulation of<br>
the connecting plug with sealing materials, as is known from<br>
the prior art. For example, the elastomer is an expedient<br>
silicone rubber or the like.<br>
In one preferred further development of the invention, the<br>
sealing means can be latched in the insulating body of the<br>
component. Latching grooves, for example, are formed for this<br>
purpose in the insulating body, into which the sealing means<br>
are pressed during insertion of the connecting plug. By way of<br>
example, the latching grooves are located in a recess which is<br>
provided in the insulating body and into which the connecting<br>
element projects. The sealing means are sufficiently elastic<br>
that, on the one hand they allow them to enter the latching<br>
grooves and thus to engage behind them. On the other hand, the<br>
elasticity is chosen so that a sufficiently high retention<br>
force is provided in order to prevent the connecting plug from<br>
accidentally sliding out of the insulating body. By way of<br>
example, the sealing means are a single sealing element.<br>
The semiconductive plastic advantageously contains<br>
polyphenylene sulfide and carbon fibers. This mixture ensures<br>
sufficiently high conductivity, with the coefficient of thermal<br>
expansion being very largely matched to that of the cast resin<br>
which is normally used for production of the insulating body.<br>
Mechanical stresses between the electrode section and the<br>
insulating body with<br><br>
resultant material fractures are prevented in this way. The<br>
semiconductive plastic is preferably composed only of the two<br>
constituents that have been mentioned, however, within the<br>
scope of this further development, it is also possible to use<br>
conventional additives, with the stated proportion of the<br>
carbon fibers always relating to the total weight of the<br>
electrode section.<br>
According to one expedient further development in this context,<br>
the proportion of carbon fibers is between 15% by weight and<br>
35% by weight. A carbon fiber proportion in this range has been<br>
found to be sufficient to provide the required conductivity.<br>
The non-conductive material is advantageously composed of<br>
polyphenylene sulfide. As has already been stated in<br>
conjunction with the electrode section that is made to be<br>
semiconductive by the carbon component, the polyphenylene<br>
sulfide has a coefficient of thermal expansion which<br>
corresponds very largely to that of the cast resin. According<br>
to the invention, stresses between the holder and the<br>
insulating body are thus also prevented.<br>
In contrast to this, the non-conductive material has a mixture<br>
of polyphenylene sulfide and glass fibers. The glass fibers<br>
reinforce the holder, thus resulting in increased mechanical<br>
strength. This makes it possible to avoid destruction or<br>
deformation of the coupling electrode, for example during the<br>
production process.<br>
The electrode section expediently has a roughened surface. The<br>
roughened surface improves the adhesion of the electrode<br>
section in the insulating body. This ensures a non-detachable<br>
connection between<br><br>
the electrode section and the insulating body, and prevents<br>
discharge processes from occurring.<br>
The holder advantageously has a holding ring which is connected<br>
to the electrode section.<br>
In one expedient further development in this context, the<br>
holding ring is connected to positioning feet, whose free ends<br>
form the positioning means.<br>
The component according to the invention has a coupling<br>
electrode as described above and can be produced more easily<br>
and at a lower cost owing to the simpler positioning of the<br>
coupling electrode.<br>
The component is expediently a bushing which allows conductor<br>
sections at a high-voltage potential to be passed through a<br>
wall to which, for example, ground potential is applied,<br>
without this resulting in discharge processes.<br>
In contrast to this, the component is a so-called post<br>
insulator whose free ends are on the one hand connected to<br>
components at a high-voltage potential and on the other hand<br>
are connected to components at ground potential.<br>
The coupling electrode is advantageously completely embedded in<br>
the insulating body.<br>
Further expedient refinements and advantages of the invention<br>
are the subject matter of the following descriptions of<br>
exemplary embodiments with reference to the figures of the accompanying<br><br>
drawing, with identical reference symbols referring to<br>
identical components, and in which:<br>
Figure 1 shows a perspective view of one exemplary embodiment<br>
of the coupling electrode according to the invention,<br>
Figure 2 shows a cross-sectional view through one exemplary<br>
embodiment of the component according to the<br>
invention,<br>
Figure 3 shows an enlarged illustration of the component shown<br>
in Figure 2 in the form of a cross-sectional view,<br>
and<br>
Figure 4 shows a further exemplary embodiment of the component<br>
according to the invention, in the form of a cross-<br>
sectional view.<br>
Figure 1 shows one exemplary embodiment of the coupling<br>
electrode 1 according to the invention, illustrated in<br>
perspective. The coupling electrode 1 has an annular electrode<br>
section 2 as well as a connecting pin 3, which is electrically<br>
to it, as a connecting element which, in the example shown in<br>
Figure 1, is attached to the lower ring side of the electrode<br>
section 2, and projects outwards from there.<br>
The coupling electrode 1 also has a holder 4, whose attachment<br>
side 5 is firmly connected to the electrode section 2. For this<br>
purpose, the holder 4 has a holding ring 4a which is clamped to<br>
the electrode section and on which three identical L-shaped<br>
holding feet 4b are integrally formed. The longer limbs of the<br>
L-shaped holding feet 4b of the holder 4 are in the form of<br>
free ends, thus forming positioning means 7. The three free<br>
ends 7<br><br>
define a planar positioning surface on which the coupling<br>
electrode 1 can be mounted securely and in a stable manner.<br>
Electrode section 2 of the coupling electrode 1 is made of a<br>
semiconductive plastic and is in this case made of<br>
polyphenylene sulfide with a carbon proportion of 30% by<br>
weight. The electrically non-conductive holder 4 is in contrast<br>
produced from pure polyphenylene sulfide, which has been<br>
mechanically reinforced with glass fibers.<br>
Figures 2 and 3 show one exemplary embodiment of a component 8<br>
according to the invention, in the form of a cross-sectional<br>
view. The component 8 illustrated here has a rotationally<br>
symmetrical insulating body 9 composed of cast resin. A<br>
conductor section 10 extends through the insulating body 9 and<br>
is equipped with attachment means 11 and 12 at its two free<br>
ends. The conductor section can be connected by the attachment<br>
means 11, 12 to conductors which are at a high-voltage<br>
potential, so that the conductor section 10 is itself at a<br>
high-voltage potential during operation.<br>
A flange 13, whose free end 14 extends into the insulating body<br>
9 and is sealed there by an elastic material 15, is used for<br>
attachment of the component 8, which in this case is a bushing,<br>
in the opening through a housing which is at ground potential.<br>
In order to measure the potential on the conductor section 10,<br>
the coupling electrode 1 is arranged with its electrode section<br>
2 concentrically around the conductor section 10, and is<br>
likewise embedded in the insulating body 9. In this case, the<br>
positioning means 7 on the holder 4 are placed on the flange<br>
13. A connecting plug 15, that is connected to a connecting<br>
line 14, is provided in order to tap off the potential on the<br><br>
electrode section 2 at the connecting pin 3, with the<br>
connecting line 14 and (except for its insertion end which<br>
makes contact with the connecting pin 3) the connecting plug 15<br>
also being surrounded in a flexible manner by an insulating<br>
material. The connecting plug 15 is held, insulated from the<br>
external environment, on the insulating body 9 by sealing means<br>
16 which are made from an elastic and non-conductive material,<br>
such as silicone or silicone rubber. The sealing means 16 are<br>
pushed into latching grooves, which are formed in a cutout 17,<br>
by pushing the connecting plug 15 into the cutout 17 that is<br>
formed in the insulating body 9. During this process, the<br>
connecting plug 15 is clamped in the cutout 17 by the latched<br>
sealing means 16, thus resulting in the connecting plug 15<br>
being held in a robust manner and electrically sealed.<br>
Figure 3 shows an enlarged illustration of the connecting line<br>
14 with the connecting plug 15 and the sealing means 16. As can<br>
be seen from this illustration, the electrode section 2 is<br>
clamped on an outer ring section 4a of the holder 4. The<br>
connecting pin 3 in the illustrated exemplary embodiment is not<br>
formed integrally with the electrode section 2. In fact, the<br>
connecting pin 3 is positioned in a push-in opening in the<br>
electrode section 2, and is clamped to it. The sealing means 16<br>
in the illustrated exemplary embodiment are in the form of a<br>
single elastic silicone element.<br>
Within the scope of the invention, it may also be expedient to<br>
cover the outside of the connecting plug 15 with a shrink<br>
sleeve even before it is inserted onto the connecting pin 3.<br>
This improves the sealing, in conjunction with the sealing<br>
means 16. It should also be<br><br>
noted that the sealing means 16 cannot just extend within the<br>
cutout 17, but can also be passed out of it.<br>
Figure 4 shows a further exemplary embodiment of a component<br>
according to the invention, with this being a so-called post<br>
insulator 18, or in other words an insulating post. The post<br>
insulator 18 once again has a conductor section 19, although<br>
this does not extend entirely through the insulating body 9 of<br>
the post insulator 18 but has a free end which is completely<br>
embedded in the insulating body 9. The conductor section 19<br>
also has attachment means 11 for attachment of a conductor,<br>
which is not shown but is at a high-voltage potential. At the<br>
opposite end of the post insulator 18 to the attachment means<br>
11, this forms a positioning surface on which the post<br>
insulator 18 can be attached at a surface which is at ground<br>
potential. Discharging shields 20 are used to increase the<br>
creepage distance along the outer surface of the post<br>
insulator. As can also be seen, the coupling electrode 1<br>
according to the invention is embedded in the insulating body<br>
9. In the illustrated exemplary embodiment, the connecting<br>
element 3, which is firmly and electrically conductively<br>
connected to the electrode section 2, is not in the form of a<br>
pin but is bent at an angle of 90° with its free end projecting<br>
into a cutout 21 in the insulating body 9.<br>
The insertion end of the connecting plug 15 is matched to the<br>
depth of the cutout 21, thus allowing the potential on the<br>
electrode section 2 to be tapped off reliably in this<br>
embodiment of the component 18 as well. Once again, a sealing<br>
means 16 which can be latched is used for secure attachment of<br>
the connecting plug 15 to the insulating body 9, and for<br><br>
electrical sealing of the connecting plug 15, as well as to<br>
prevent the ingress of moisture into the cutout 21.<br><br>
