				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates in general to surgical instruments that are suitable<br>
for endoscopically inserting an end effector (e.g., endocutter, grasper, cutter,<br>
staplers, clip applier, access device, drug/gene therapy delivery device, and a<br>
energy device using ultrasound, RF, laser, etc.) to a surgical site, and more<br>
particularly to such surgical instruments with an articulating shaft.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Endoscopic surgical instruments are often preferred over traditional open<br>
surgical devices since a smaller incision tends to reduce the post-operative<br>
recovery time and complications. Consequently, significant development has<br>
gone into a range of endoscopic surgical instruments that are suitable for precise<br>
placement of a distal end effector at a desired surgical site through a cannula of<br>
a trocar. These distal end effectors engage the tissue in a number of ways to<br>
achieve a diagnostic or therapeutic<br><br>
effect (e.g., endocutter, grasper, cutter, staplers, clip applier, access device, drug/gene<br>
therapy delivery device, and energy device using ultrasound, RF, laser, etc.).<br>
Positioning the end effector is constrained by the trocar. Generally these endoscopic<br>
surgical instruments include a long shaft between the end effector and a handle portion<br>
manipulated by the clinician, this long shaft enables insertion to a desired depth and<br>
rotation about the longitudinal axis of the shaft, thereby positioning the end effector to a<br>
degree. With judicious placement of the trocar and use of graspers, for instance, through<br>
another trocar, often this amount of positioning is sufficient. Surgical stapling and<br>
severing instruments, such as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,465,895, are an example of<br>
an endoscopic surgical instrument that successfully positions an end effector by<br>
insertion and rotation.<br>
Depending upon the nature of the operation, it may be desirable to further adjust the<br>
positioning of the end effector of an endoscopic surgical instrument rather than being<br>
limited to insertion and rotation. In particular, it is often desirable to orient the end<br>
effector at an axis transverse to the longitudinal axis of the shaft of the instrument. The<br>
transverse movement of the end effector relative to the instrument shaft is conventionally<br>
referred to as "articulation". This articulated positioning permits the clinician to more<br>
easily engage tissue in some instances. In addition, articulated positioning<br>
advantageously allows an endoscope to be positioned behind the end effector without<br>
being blocked by the instrument shaft.<br>
While the aforementioned non-articulating stapling and severing instruments have great<br>
utility and may be successfully employed in many surgical procedures, it is desirable to<br>
enhance their operation with the ability to articulate the end effector, thereby giving<br>
greater clinical flexibility in their use. To that end, the four above cross-referenced<br>
applications disclose use of a rotational motion to articulate an end effector of a surgical<br><br>
stapling and severing instrument. A clinician rotates an outer control at the base<br>
of the shaft of the instrument to effect this articulation. In other articulating<br>
surgical instruments, articulation is generally effected by a longitudinal or<br>
rotational control input that is transferred as a longitudinal movement to the<br>
articulation joint. For instance, U.S. Pat. No. 6,241,139 describes a rotary control<br>
operably coupled to a stepped cam driver slot. Rotary motion of the control<br>
moves an<br><br>
intermediate piece containing the stepped cam driver slot laterally to articulate<br>
the end effector.<br>
While these articulation controls do perform the intended function, it is believed<br>
that an enhanced articulation control may provide additional benefits. For<br>
instance, it would be desirable if the visual indication and tactile feel provided by<br>
the articulation control were intuitively understood by the clinician as to the<br>
expected direction and amount of articulation In addition, it would be further<br>
desirable that the articulation control readily accept adjustment by the clinician<br>
yet resist a force on the end effector that may inadvertently change the amount of<br>
articulation. Furthermore, it would be further desirable that some versions of the<br>
articulation control be particularly suited for a surgical stapling and severing<br>
instrument that has a rotational motion down the shaft to effect articulation.<br>
Consequently, a significant need exists for an improved articulation control for a<br>
surgical instrument.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention overcomes the above-noted and other deficiencies of the prior art<br>
by providing an articulating surgical instrument that advantageously incorporates<br>
a lateral articulation control so that the user has an intuitive control of the<br>
articulation of an end effector. Such an instrument has particular utility in<br>
endoscopic use wherein the end effector is passed through a cannula<br>
passageway to a surgical site. Reaching the surgical site at a desired orientation,<br>
and perhaps being inserted behind other tissue, is facilitated by an articulation of<br><br>
the end effector from the longitudinal axis of a shaft. This task is assisted by the<br>
lateral articulation control providing an intuitive indication of the direction and<br>
amount of articulation of the end effector.<br>
In one aspect of the invention, a surgical instrument that positions an end effector<br>
at a surgical site for performing a diagnostic or therapeutic treatment by inserting<br>
its shaft through a cannula passageway. The shaft advantageously includes an<br>
articulation motion transfer member that allows a clinician to articulate the end<br>
effector from a longitudinal axis of the shaft by controlling an articulation<br>
mechanism that pivotally couples the end effector to a distal end of the shaft. The<br>
user laterally<br><br>
positions an actuator to cause this articulation motion to be transferred through<br>
the shaft, with the lateral motion thereof converted into the articulation motion by<br>
a motion conversion mechanism. Thereby, the user receives an intuitive<br>
indication of which direction the end effector is articulated and the relative<br>
amount of articulation.<br>
In another aspect of the invention, a surgical instrument performs articulation of<br>
the end effector by an articulation mechanism that responds to a rotational<br>
motion. A lateral articulation control again provides the intuitive control to a user<br>
by converting lateral motion into the rotational motion transferred through the<br>
shaft to the articulation mechanism.<br>
In yet another aspect of the invention, a surgical instrument that is suitable<br>
endoscopic for such operations as stapling and severing by having three motions<br>
transferable to an end effector, specifically a firing motion, a closing motion, and<br>
an articulation motion. The lateral articulation control is positionable by the user<br>
to produce the articulation motion that causes the end effector to articulate. Since<br>
the end effector is remotely viewed by an endoscope that may be oriented from a<br>
different perspective than the user of the instrument, which may complicate<br>
visualizing the amount and direction of articulation of the of the end effector.<br>
However, the lateral articulation control proximate to a handle of the device gives<br>
the user this feed back.<br>
These and other objects and advantages of the present invention shall be made<br>
apparent from the accompanying drawings and the description thereof.<br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Turning to the Drawings, wherein like numerals denote like components<br>
throughout the several views, FIGS. 1-3 depict a surgical instrument, which in the<br>
illustrative embodiment is more particularly a surgical stapling and severing<br>
instrument 10, that is capable of practicing the unique benefits of the present<br>
invention. In particular, the surgical stapling and severing instrument 10 is sized<br>
for insertion, in a nonarticulated state as depicted in FIG. 1, through a trocar<br>
cannula passageway to a surgical site in a patient for performing a surgical<br>
procedure. Once an articulation mechanism 11 and a distally attached end<br>
effector 12 are inserted through the cannula passageway, the articulation<br>
mechanism 11 may be remotely articulated, as depicted in FIG. 2, by an<br>
articulation control 13. Thereby, the end effector 12 may reach behind an organ<br>
or approach tissue from a desired angle or for other reasons. For instance, a<br>
firing mechanism, advantageously depicted as an E-beam firing bar 14 (depicted<br>
in FIG. 3), that severs clamped tissue, engages an elongate channel 16 and a<br>
pivotally attached anvil 18.<br><br>
The surgical and stapling and severing instrument 10 includes a handle portion<br>
20 connected to an implement portion 22, the latter further comprising a shaft 23<br>
distally terminating in the articulating mechanism 11 and the end effector 12. The<br>
handle portion 20 includes a pistol grip 24 toward which a closure trigger 26 is<br>
pivotally drawn by the clinician to cause clamping, or closing, of the anvil 18<br>
toward the elongate channel 16 of the end effector 12. A firing trigger 28 is<br>
farther outboard of the closure trigger 26 and is pivotally drawn by the clinician to<br>
cause the stapling<br><br>
and severing of clamped tissue in the end effector 12. Thereafter, a release<br>
button 30 is depressed to release the clamped tissue.<br>
An outmost closure sleeve 32 of the shaft 23 longitudinally translates in<br>
response to the closure trigger 26 to pivotally close the anvil 18. Specifically, a<br>
distal portion, or closure ring 33, of the closure sleeve 32 with respect to the<br>
articulation mechanism 11 is indirectly supported by a frame 34 of the implement<br>
portion 22 (partially visible at the articulation mechanism 11). At the articulation<br>
mechanism 11, a proximal portion, or closure tube 35, of the closure sleeve 32<br>
communicates with the distal portion (closure ring) 33. The frame 34 is flexibly<br>
attached to the elongate channel 16 via the articulation mechanism 11, enabling<br>
articulation in a single plane. The frame 34 also longitudinally slidingly supports a<br>
firing drive member 36 that communicates a firing motion from the firing trigger<br>
28 to the firing bar 14. Only the firing bar 14 of the firing drive member 36 is<br>
depicted FIG. 3, but the firing drive member 36 is described below further detail<br>
with regard to various versions of a rotationally controlled articulation mechanism<br>
11.<br>
It will be appreciated that the terms "proximal" and "distal" are used herein with<br>
reference to a clinician gripping a handle of an instrument. Thus, the end effector<br>
12 is distal with respect to the more proximal handle portion 20. It will be further<br>
appreciated that for convenience and clarity, spatial terms such as "vertical" and<br>
"horizontal" are used herein with respect to the drawings. However, surgical<br>
instruments are used in many orientations and positions, and these terms are not<br>
intended to be limiting and absolute.<br><br>
E-Beam Firing Bar<br>
FIGS. 3-5 depict the end effector 12 employing the E-beam firing bar 14 to<br>
perform a number of functions. In FIG. 3, the firing bar 14 is proximally<br>
positioned, allowing an unspent staple cartridge 37 to be installed into the<br>
elongate channel 16. In particular, an upper pin 38 of the firing bar 14 resides<br>
within a recess, depicted as an anvil pocket 40 allowing the anvil 18 to be<br>
repeatedly opened and closed. With the end effector closed as depicted in FIG.<br>
4, the firing bar 14 is advanced in engagement with the anvil 18 by having the<br>
upper pin 38 enter a longitudinal anvil slot 42. A lower most pin, or firing bar cap<br>
44, engaged a lower surface of the elongate channel<br><br>
16 by having the firing bar 14 extend through a channel slot 45. A middle pin 46<br>
slidingly engages a top surface of the elongate channel 16, cooperating with the<br>
firing bar cap 44. Thereby, the firing bar 14 affirmatively spaces the end effector<br>
12 during firing, overcoming pinching that may occur with a minimal amount of<br>
clamped tissue and overcoming staple malformation with an excessive amount of<br>
clamped tissue.<br>
During firing, a distally presented cutting edge 48 between the upper pin 38 and<br>
middle pin 46 of the firing bar enters a proximally presented vertical slot 49 of the<br>
staple cartridge 37, severing tissue clamped between the staple cartridge 37 and<br>
the anvil 18. As shown in FIG. 4, the middle pin 46 actuates the staple cartridge<br>
37 by entering into a firing slot within the staple cartridge 37, driving a wedge<br>
sled 41 into upward camming contact with staple drivers 43 that in turn drive a<br>
plurality of staples 47 out of staple apertures 51 in the staple cartridge 37 into<br>
forming contact with staple pockets 53 on an inner surface of the anvil 18. FIG. 5<br>
depicts the firing bar 14 fully distally translated after completing severing and<br>
stapling tissue.<br>
Two-Axis Handle<br>
With reference to FIGS. 6-7, the handle portion 20 is comprised of first and<br>
second base sections 50 and 52, which are molded from a polymeric material<br>
such as a glass-filled polycarbonate. The first base section 50 is provided with a<br>
plurality of cylindrical-shaped pins 54. The second base section 52 includes a<br>
plurality of extending members 56, each having a hexagonal-shaped opening 58.<br><br>
The cylindrical-shaped pins 54 are received within the hexagonal-shaped<br>
openings 58 and are frictionally held therein for maintaining the first and second<br>
base sections 50 and 52 in assembly.<br>
A housing cap 60 has a bore 62 extending completely through it for engaging<br>
and rotating the implement portion 22 about its longitudinal axis. The housing cap<br>
60 includes an inwardly protruding boss 64 extending along at least a portion of<br>
the bore 62. The protruding boss 64 is received within a longitudinal slot 66<br>
formed at a proximal portion of the closure sleeve 32 such that rotation of the<br>
housing cap 60 effects rotation of the closure sleeve 32. It will be appreciated<br>
that the boss 64 further extends through frame 34 and into contact with a portion<br>
of the firing drive member<br><br>
36 to effect their rotation as well. Thus, the end effector 12 (not shown in FIGS.<br>
3-4) rotates with the housing cap 60.<br>
A proximal end 68 of the frame 34 passes proximally through the housing cap 60<br>
and is provided with a circumferential notch 70 that is engaged by opposing<br>
channel securement members 72 extending respectively from the base sections<br>
50 and 52. Only the channel securement member 72 of the second base section<br>
52 is shown. The channel securement members 72 extending from the base<br>
sections 50, 52 serve tsecure the frame 34 to the handle portion 20 such that the<br>
frame 34 does not move longitudinally relative to the handle portion 20.<br>
The closure trigger 26 has a handle section 74, a gear segment section 76, and<br>
an intermediate section 78. A bore 80 extends through the intermediate section<br>
78. A cylindrical support member 82 extending from the second base section 52<br>
passes through the bore 80 for pivotally mounting the closure trigger 26 on the<br>
handle portion 20. A second cylindrical support member 83 extending ] from the<br>
second base section 52 passes through a bore 81 of firing trigger 28 for pivotally<br>
mounting on the handle portion 20. A hexagonal opening 84 is provided in the<br>
cylindrical support member 83 for receiving a securement pin (not shown)<br>
extending from the first base section 50.<br>
A closure yoke 86 is housed within the handle portion 20 for reciprocating<br>
movement therein and serves to transfer motion from the closure trigger 26 to the<br>
closure sleeve 32. Support members 88 extending from the second base section<br>
52 and securement member 72, which extends through a recess 89 in the yoke<br>
86, support the yoke 86 within the handle portion 20.<br><br>
A proximal end 90 of the closure sleeve 32 is provided with a flange 92 that is<br>
snap-fitted into a receiving recess 94 formed in a distal end 96 of the yoke 86. A<br>
proximal end 98 of the yoke 86 has a gear rack 100 that is engaged by the gear<br>
segment section 76 of the closure trigger 26. When the closure trigger 26 is<br>
moved toward the pistol grip 24 of the handle portion 20, the yoke 86 and, hence,<br>
the closure sleeve 32 move distally, compressing a spring 102 that biases the<br>
yoke 86 proximally. Distal movement of the closure sleeve 32 effects pivotal<br>
translation movement of the<br><br>
anvil 18 distally and toward the elongate channel 16 of the end effector 12 and<br>
proximal movement effects closing, as discussed below.<br>
The closure trigger 26 is forward biased to an open position by a front surface<br>
130 interacting with an engaging surface 128 of the firing trigger 28. Clamp first<br>
hook 104 that pivots top to rear in the handle portion 20 about a pin 106 restrains<br>
movement of the firing trigger 28 toward the pistol grip 24 until the closure trigger<br>
26 is clamped to its closed position. Hook 104 restrains firing trigger 28 motion by<br>
engaging a lockout pin 107 in firing trigger 28. The hook 104 is also in contact<br>
with the closure trigger 26. In particular, a forward projection 108 of the hook 104<br>
engages a member 110 on the intermediate section 78 of the closure trigger 26,<br>
the member 110 being outward of the bore 80 toward the handle section 74.<br>
Hook 104 is biased toward contact with member 110 of the closure trigger 26 and<br>
engagement with lockout pin 107 in firing trigger 28 by a release spring 112. As<br>
the closure trigger 26 is depressed, the hook 104 is moved top to rear,<br>
compressing the release spring 112 that is captured between a rearward<br>
projection 114 on the hook 104 and a forward projection 116 on the release<br>
button 30.<br>
As the yoke 86 moves distally in response to proximal movement of the closure<br>
trigger 26, an upper latch arm 118 of the release button 30 moves along an<br>
upper surface 120 on the yoke 86 until dropping into an upwardly presented<br>
recess 122 in a proximal, lower portion of the yoke 86. The release spring 112<br>
urges the release button 30 outward, which pivots the upper latch arm 118<br>
downwardly into engagement with the upwardly presented recess 122, thereby<br>
locking the closure trigger 26 in a tissue clamping position.<br><br>
The latch arm 118 can be moved out of the recess 122 to release the anvil 18 by<br>
pushing the release button 30 inward. Specifically, the upper latch arm 118 pivots<br>
upward about pin 123 of the second base section 52. The yoke 86 is then<br>
permitted to move proximally in response to return movement of the closure<br>
trigger 26.<br>
A firing trigger return spring 124 is located within the handle portion 20 with one<br>
end attached to pin 106 of the second base section 52 and the other end<br>
attached to a pin 126 on the firing trigger 28. The firing return spring 124 applies<br>
a return force to the pin 126 for biasing the firing trigger 28 in a direction away<br>
from the pistol<br><br>
grip 24 of the handle portion 20. The closure trigger 26 is also biased away from<br>
pistol grip 24 by engaging surface 128 of firing trigger 28 biasing front surface<br>
130 of closure trigger 26.<br>
As the closure trigger 26 is moved toward the pistol grip 24, its front surface 130<br>
engages with the engaging surface 128 on the firing trigger 28 causing the firing<br>
trigger 28 to move to its "firing" position. When in its firing position, the firing<br>
trigger 28 is located at an angle of approximately 45° to the pistol grip 24. After<br>
staple firing, the spring 124 causes the firing trigger 28 to return to its initial<br>
position. During the return movement of the firing trigger 28, its engaging surface<br>
128 pushes against the front surface 130 of the closure trigger 26 causing the<br>
closure trigger 26 to return to its initial position. A stop member 132 extends from<br>
the second base section 52 to prevent the closure trigger 26 from rotating<br>
beyond its initial position.<br>
The surgical stapling and severing instrument 10 additionally includes a<br>
reciprocating section 134, a multiplier 136 and a drive member 138. The<br>
reciprocating section 134 comprises a wedge sled, or wedge sled, in the<br>
implement portion 22 (not shown in FIG. 6-7) and a metal drive rod 140.<br>
The drive member 138 includes first and second gear racks 141 and 142. A first<br>
notch 144 is provided on the drive member 138 intermediate the first and second<br>
gear racks 141, 142. During return movement of the firing trigger 28, a tooth 146<br>
on the firing trigger 28 engages with the first notch 144 for returning the drive<br>
member 138 to its initial position after staple firing. A second notch 148 is located<br>
at a proximal end of the metal drive rod 140 for locking the metal drive rod 140 to<br>
the upper latch arm 118 of the release button 30 in its unfired position.<br><br>
The multiplier 136 comprises first and second integral pinion gears 150 and 152.<br>
The first integral pinion gear 150 is engaged with a first gear rack 154 provided<br>
on the metal drive rod 140. The second integral pinion gear 152 is engaged with<br>
the first gear rack 141 on the drive member 138. The first integral pinion gear 150<br>
has a first diameter and the second integral pinion gear 152 has a second<br>
diameter that is smaller than the first diameter.<br><br>
Rotational Articulation Control<br>
With reference to FIGS. 6-9, the handle portion 20 advantageously incorporates<br>
the articulation control 13 that both rotates the implement portion 22 about the<br>
longitudinal axis of the surgical instrument 10 and articulates the end effector 12<br>
to an angle with the longitudinal axis. A hollow articulation drive tube 200 is<br>
concentrically located within the closure sleeve 32 and is operably coupled to an<br>
actuation lever 202 such that rotation of actuation lever 202 rotates tube 200<br>
about the longitudinal axis and causes perpendicular rotation or articulation of the<br>
closure ring 250 and end effector 12. This articulation of the closure ring 250<br>
corresponds to the degree and direction of rotation of actuator lever 202 viewed<br>
and manipulated by the clinician. In the illustrative version, the relationship is one<br>
to one, with the degree of rotation of the actuator lever 202 corresponding to the<br>
degree of articulation from the longitudinal axis of the shaft 23, thus providing an<br>
intuitive indication to the clinician. It will be appreciated that other angular<br>
relationships may be selected.<br>
The articulation control 13 includes a pair of mirrored articulation transmission<br>
housings 204 that are attached to the housing cap 60. Moreover, the articulation<br>
transmission housing 204 includes longitudinally aligned external tabs 206 that a<br>
clinician twists to effect rotation of the articulation transmission housing 204, and<br>
thus of the end effector 12, about the longitudinal axis of the implement portion<br>
22. The actuator lever 202 is attached to a cylindrical articulation body 208 that<br>
resides within a cylindrical recess 210 opening generally upward and<br>
perpendicular to the shaft 23. The lowermost portion of the articulation body 208<br>
includes prongs 212 that snap fit into an opening 214 in the articulation<br>
transmission housing 208 near to the shaft 23, the prongs 212 preventing the<br>
articulation body 208 from being withdrawn from the cylindrical recess 210.<br><br>
Annularly presented gear teeth 216 are located about the lower portion of the<br>
articulation body 208 and mesh with teeth 218 on an articulation yoke 220. The<br>
articulation yoke 220 straddles an articulation rectangular window 222 formed in<br>
the closure sleeve 32. Closure sleeve 32 is slidably moveable within the<br>
articulation control 13 (in the longitudinal direction) to close and open the end<br>
effector 12. The articulation drive tube 200 moves longitudinally with the closure<br>
sleeve 32 relative to<br><br>
the fixed articulation control 13. Window 222 provides clearance for a boss 224<br>
inwardly presented from the articulation yoke 220 that passes through the<br>
rectangular window 222 to engage a slot 226 in the articulation drive tube 200,<br>
longitudinally positioning the articulation drive tube 200 for rotational motion. The<br>
hollow articulation drive tube 200 extends longitudinally within the closure sleeve<br>
32 from the articulation mechanism 11 and terminates distally before the locking<br>
tabs 227 of the closure sleeve 32. The tabs 227 are inwardly bent behind the<br>
proximal face of the articulation drive tube 200 and thereby retaining the<br>
articulation drive tube 200 in the shaft 23.<br>
It should be appreciated that the articulation transmission housing 204 is<br>
operatively associated to the closure tube 35 of the shaft 23. The housing cap 60<br>
retains the articulation yoke 220 in the articulation transmission housing 204 and<br>
retains the articulation control 13 within the handle portion 20 by presenting<br>
proximally an outer diameter circular groove 228 that engages a circular inward<br>
lip 230 at the distal opening of the assembled base sections 50, 52.<br>
FIGS. 10 and 11 depict the gear articulation mechanism 11 of FIGS. 1-2 in the<br>
form of a spur gear articulation mechanism 240, which is generally the same as<br>
described above but with additional articulation driving components on the other<br>
side of the articulation mechanism 240 to thereby increase performance.<br>
Articulation mechanism 240 has a rotatable hollow articulation drive tube 242 that<br>
is concentrically located within closure sleeve 32 and has a distally projecting<br>
gear section 244 about a first circumference portion 246. Gear section 244<br>
meshes with a spur gear 248 attached to and proximally projecting from closure<br><br>
ring 250 which pivots about pins 253 extending through first and second pivot<br>
points 252, 260 projecting distally from the closure sleeve 32. Thus, an<br>
articulation pivot axis passes through both the first and second pivot points 252,<br>
260 and pins 253 rotatably couple closure ring 250 to the closure sleeve 32.<br>
Rotation of drive 242 engages the gears 242 and 248 and articulates closure ring<br>
250 about first and second pivot points 252, 260<br>
To increase the effective surface area of gear contact between the hollow<br>
articulation drive tube 242 and the closure ring 250, a second circumference<br>
portion 254 of the hollow articulation drive tube 242 has a recessed distally<br>
projecting gear<br><br>
section 256 extending therefrom. Gear section 256 is operably coupled to a<br>
second spur gear 258 attached to and proximaily projecting from an opposite<br>
lateral side of the closure ring 250 by a reversing gear 262 pivotally supported by<br>
the frame 34. Reversing gear 262 engages both the recessed distally projecting<br>
gear section 256 on one side and the second spur gear 258 of the closure ring<br>
250 on the other.<br>
When the closure trigger 26 is actuated, both the hollow articulation drive tube<br>
242 and pivotally attached closure tube 250 of the closure sleeve 32 are moved<br>
distally to close the anvil 18. The closure tube 35 of the closure sleeve 32 is<br>
spaced away from the closure ring 33 by pivot points 252, 260 pinned to pivot<br>
holes 264 and 266 centered in spur gears 248, 258, and a frame opening 268<br>
that extends therethrough. The frame opening 268 provides clearance so that the<br>
proximal edges of the closure ring 33 and the distal edges of the closure tube 35<br>
of the closure sleeve 32 do not collide during articulation.<br>
FIG. 11 depicts in disassembled form an implement portion 270 that includes the<br>
spur gear articulation mechanism 240. A frame 272 is longitudinally attachable to<br>
the handle portion 20 (depicted in FIGS. 1 and 2) with a bushing 274 on its<br>
proximal end for rotatingly engagement thereto. A frame trough 276 formed by an<br>
opening 278 longitudinally aligned with the center of the frame 272 is longer than<br>
a firing connector 280 that slides longitudinally within the frame trough 276. The<br>
proximal end of the firing connector 280 rotatingly engages the distal end of the<br>
metal drive bar 140 (depicted in FIG. 6). The distal end of the firing connector<br>
280 includes a slot 282 that receives a proximal end of the firing bar 14, attached<br>
therein by pins 284. A more distal portion of the firing bar 14 is positioned within<br>
a lower groove 286 in a firing bar slotted guide 288 that is distally engaged with<br>
an articulating frame member 290 and the frame 272.<br><br>
Articulating frame member 290 has a channel-anchoring member 292 that<br>
distally attaches to an attachment collar 294 of a proximal portion in the elongate<br>
channel 16. The firing bar 14 passes through a lower slot 295 in the articulating<br>
frame member 290. The articulating frame member 290 is spaced away from the<br>
distal end of the frame 272 by the firing bar slotted guide 288 and flexibly<br>
attached thereto for articulation by a resilient connector 296. A widened proximal<br>
end 298 of<br><br>
proximally directed teeth rack 432 with vertically aligned teeth 434 that engage<br>
an upper portion 436 of a vertically-aligned elongate gear 438. A lower portion<br>
440 of the vertically aligned elongate gear 438 engages a right-facing gear rack<br>
442 connected proximally to the articulation control rod 406.<br>
Thus, as the lateral control actuator 426 is moved laterally to the left, its<br>
proximally directed teeth rack 432 rotates the elongate gear 438 counter<br>
clockwise, as viewed from the top, thereby moving the right-facing gear rack 442<br>
proximally drawing the articulation control rod 406 proximally. Thereby, the end<br>
effection 403 is articulated to the left since the articulation control rod 406<br>
attaches at a pin 444 on the proximal end 420 of the end effector to the left of the<br>
pivot 412.<br>
It will be appreciated that various other lateral-to-longitudinal gear mechanisms<br>
may be employed. For instance, having both gear racks 432,442 engage the<br>
elongate gear 438 from opposite sides with respect to their respective<br>
engagements that are depicted would accomplish a like result. Moreover,<br>
reversing the engagement in only one of the two could be done in conjunction<br>
with reversing the attachment of the longitudinal control rod 406 from the left of<br>
the pivot 412 to the right. As yet a further alternative, switching one of these<br>
three orientation or all three to their respective opposite configuration may<br>
inverse the control, articulating the end effector 408 in an opposite direction as<br>
the lateral control actuator 426.<br><br>
It should be further appreciated that the depicted lateral-to-longitudinal gear<br>
mechanism creates a degree of articulation that is related to the distance of a<br>
pivoting connection at pin 444 of the longitudinal control rod 406 to the end<br>
effector 408 normal to the pivot axis. Varying this amount of articulation travel<br>
relative to the movement of the lateral control actuator 426 may be achieved by<br>
gear relationship between the gear rack 432 of the lateral control actuator 426<br>
and the gear rack 442 connected to the longitudinal control rod 406. For<br>
instance, the elongate gear 438 may have an upper portion having a diameter<br>
that differs from the diameter of the lower portion.<br><br>
LATERAL-TO-ROTATIONAL CONTROL OF AN ARTICULATION MECHANISM<br>
FIGS. 13-16 depict a lateral articulation control 500 that provides similar intuitive<br>
clinician control features for an articulating surgical instrument 502 similar to that<br>
described for FIGS 1-11. In particular, the lateral articulation control 500<br>
converts a lateral motion into a rotational motion transferred by an articulation<br>
drive tube 504 to an articulation mechanism (not shown in FIGS 13-16). A<br>
downward projecting gear rack 506 is coupled to a lower side 508 of a lateral<br>
control actuator 510 for engaging with longitudinally aligned grooves 512 on a<br>
top face of the articulation drive tube 504.<br>
An articulation backdrive lockout 516 is advantageously incorporated into the<br>
lateral articulation control 500 to prevent a force upon the end effector (not<br>
depicted in FIGS 13-16) from changing the amount of articulation. In particular,<br>
interposed between the articulation control actuator 510 and the gear rack 506 is<br>
a rack plate 518 that includes a central opening 520 containing a flexible X-<br>
shaped locking member 522. Te articulation control actuator 510 includes two<br>
deflection blades 524,526 that downwardly project into the central opening 520<br>
of the rack plate 518 and are positioned respectively in a distal and a proximal<br>
quadrant defined by the X-shaped locking member 522 with respect to a top<br>
view depicted in FIGS 15-16. The gear rack 506 includes two drive blades<br><br>
532,534 that upwardly project into the central opening 520 of the rack plate 518<br>
and are positioned respectively in the left and right quadrants 536,538 defined<br>
by the X-shaped locking member 522. The central opening 520 of the rack plate<br>
518 is shown as being generally rectangular in shape, but with ramped teeth<br>
540, each presenting an abutting surface 542 inwardly facing and longitudinally<br>
aligned. These ramped teeth 540 are placed along a right and left portion<br>
544,546 of a distal edge 548 to ratchedly contact right and left distal arms<br>
550,552 respectively of the X-shaped locking member 522. The ramped teeth<br>
540 are also placed along a right and left portion 554,556 of a proximal edge 558<br>
of the rectangular window 520 to ratchedly contact right and left proximal arms<br>
560,562 of the X-shaped locking member 522.<br><br>
With particular reference to FIG. 14, the gear rack 518 is illustrated as attached<br>
to a knob 564 and thus does not laterally translate with the articulation control<br>
actuator 510 or the gear rack 506. Lateral movement of the articulation control<br>
actuator 510 is transferred through the articulation backdrive lockout 516 formed<br>
inside the rectangular window 520 of the rack frame 518. By contrast, a<br>
backdriven lateral movement of the articulation drive tube 504 and hence the<br>
gear rack 506 is reacted by the articulation backdrive lockout 516 into the rack<br>
frame 518 and into the knob 560. Thus movement of the articulation drive tube<br>
504 is arrested.<br>
In use, as depicted in FIG. 15, the lateral articulation control 500 is centered.<br>
Thereby, a visual indication is given to the clinician by the equally extended left<br>
and right ends 566, 568 of the articulation control actuator 510. The deflection<br>
blades 524, 526 are centered on the X-shaped lockout member 522, exerting no<br>
force on the arms 550, 552, 560, 562, which are thereby allowed to extend<br>
toward their uncompressed state into abutting contact with the ramped teeth 540,<br>
preventing lateral movement of the X-shaped lockout member 522. The drive<br>
blades 532, 534 of the gear rack 506 are in opposing contact on each side of the<br>
«<br>
X-shaped lockout member 522. Any lateral force transferred from the articulation<br>
drive tube 504 into the gear rack 506 through the drive blades 532, 534 is<br>
reacted through the X-shaped lockout member 522 into the gear rack 506,<br>
preventing movement.<br>
By contrast, as depicted in FIG. 16, when a clinician moves the articulation<br>
control actuator 510 to one lateral side, the deflection blades 524, 526 contact a<br><br>
pair of proximal and distal arms (the left ones 552, 562 in FIG. 16) compressing<br>
the pair away from contact with the rectangular window 520. Thus, the X-shaped<br>
lockout member 522 is allowed to move in that direction with the trailing pair of<br>
arms (e.g., right ones 550, 560 in FIG. 16) ratcheting along. This lateral<br>
movement is allowed to continue until the leading arms 552, 562 encounter the<br>
lateral extend of the rectangular window 520 as depicted. The drive blades 532,<br>
534 of the gear rack 506 move with the X-shaped lockout member 522 and thus<br>
ultimately the end effector (not shown in FIG. 16) also articulates in response.<br>
The present invention has been discussed in terms of endoscopic procedures<br>
and apparatus. However, use herein of terms such as "endoscopic", should not<br>
be<br><br>
construed to limit the present invention to a surgical stapling and severing<br>
instrument for use only in conjunction with an endoscopic tube (i.e., trocar). On<br>
the contrary, it is believed that the present invention may find use in any<br>
procedure where access is limited to a small incision, including but not limited to<br>
laparoscopic procedures, as well as open procedures.<br>
While the present invention has been illustrated by description of several<br>
embodiments and while the illustrative embodiments have been described in<br>
considerable detail, it is not the intention of the applicant to restrict or in any way<br>
limit the scope of the appended claims to such detail. Additional advantages and<br>
modifications may readily appear to those skilled in the art.<br>
For yet another example, although an illustrative handle portion 20 described<br>
herein is manually operated by a clinician, it is consistent with aspects of the<br>
invention for some or all of the functions of a handle portion to be powered (e.g.,<br>
pneumatic, hydraulic, electromechanical, ultrasonic, etc.). Furthermore, controls<br>
of each of these functions may be manually presented on a handle portion or be<br>
remotely controlled (e.g., wireless remote, automated .. remote console, etc.).<br>
As yet an additional example, although a simultaneous stapling and severing<br>
instrument is advantageously illustrated herein, it would be consistent with<br>
aspects of the invention rotationally controlled articulation with other types of end<br>
effectors, such as grasper, cutter, staplers, clip applier, access device, drug/gene .<br>
therapy delivery device, and a energy device using ultrasound, RF, laser, etc.<br><br>
