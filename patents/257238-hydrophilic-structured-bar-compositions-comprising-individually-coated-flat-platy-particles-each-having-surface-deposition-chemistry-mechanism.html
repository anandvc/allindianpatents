HINDUSTAN UNILEVER LIMITED, a company incorporated under the Indian Companies Act, 1913 and having its registered office at Hindustan Lever House, 165/166, Backbay Reclamation, Mumbai -400 020, Maharashtra, India<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed<br><br><br>
WO 2007/101586<br><br>
PCT/EP2007/001703<br><br>

HYDROPHILIC STRUCTURED BAR COMPOSITIONS COMPRISING<br>
INDIVIDUALLY COATED PLAT PLATY PARTICLES, EACH HAVING<br>
SURFACE DEPOSITION CHEMISTRY MECHANISM<br>
5<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to bar compositions comprising reflective platy optical materials.  More particularly, each<br>
10  of the individual platy particles has a surface deposition chemistry mechanism (e.g., coating or film of cationic polymer and anionic surfactant formed in situ on substantially each individual particle) which allows the particles to attach individually and form a foam-particle<br>
15  structure (e.g., where coated deposition system helps particles attach to surface of foam bubbles), and to be independent of any more generalized deposition system (e.g., such as flocculating surfactant-cationic polymer systems where polymer and anionic surfactant form flocculates which<br>
20  carry non coated particles on the floc, thereby aiding deposition).  Deposition occurs predominantly (&gt;50% of original particles) from foam/particles in the foam portion of a foam and liquor which forms during rinse/dilution. Enhanced deposition, independent of a generalized, "carrier"<br>
25  flocculating deposition system, allows the formulation of bars which demonstrate radiant luminosity through the deposition of reflective flat optical material during the cleansing process.<br>
30  The actual formulations of the bar is also an important factor in whether flocculation will be avoided.  In one<br><br>
WO 2007/101586<br><br>
PCT/EP2007/001703<br><br>
-   2   -<br>
embodiment of the subject invention, the composition comprises 0.1 to 80%, preferably 20 to 80% hydrophilic structurant in combination with 5 to 60% non-soap  surfactant (although broadly, amounts of surfactant, soap and non-soap; 5  and of structurant are as defined).  In a second embodiment, the bar composition is predominantly soap (e.g., 40 to 90% by wt. soap) and less hydrophilic structurant may be used (e.g., preferably 0.1 to 40%).  The composition may also comprise 0-30% synthetic, non-soap detergent. 10<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
The delivery from bars of enhanced visual benefits to the<br>
15  skin using particulate optical modifier is disclosed, for example, in applicants' U.S. Publication No. 2005/0233916 published October 20, 2005 and entitled "Beauty Wash Product Compositions Delivering Enhanced Visual Benefits To The Skin with Specific Optical Attributes".<br>
20<br>
In that reference, there is no teaching or suggestion that desired optical particles can individually attach directly to foam bubbles (e.g., through deposition chemistry on individual particles rather than a more generalized floe<br>
25  system in which floes carry multiple particles), and that these particles deposit when lather/particle structures formed from the coated particles attaching to bubbles (foam) contact skin or other substrate (e.g., in rinse) independent of whether or not a floc deposition system is present.<br>
30  Dependent claims in that reference in fact recite that<br>
cationic polymer and anionic surfactant will precipitate and<br><br>
WO 2007/101586<br><br>
PCT/EP2007/001703<br><br>
-   3   -<br>
that this precipitate may be a floc.  Also, there is no distinction in the reference as to the shape of particles and it is clear from the reference that particles may be spheroidal, platy or cylindrical.  Also, there is nothing 5  specific about the bar formulation and what may or may not trigger flocculation (e.g., certain amounts of hydrophilic structurant and/or soap).<br>
By contrast, the particles of the subject invention must be 10  flat (e.g., platy) and must be capable of attaching to bubbles/foam so that they will deposit from the lather/particle structure so formed directly rather than be dependent on a deposition system for deposition.  Thus, deposition systems (e.g., anionic surfactant-cationic 15  polymers) are not excluded from this invention.  However, the mechanism of particle deposition is not primarily through floc and carry, but through deposition of individual particles from particle-lather structure.<br>
20  U.S. Patent No. 6,780,826 to Zhang discloses platy particles similar to those of the invention.  However, this reference fails to disclose the required deposition chemistry and further does not recognize that bar formulation (amount of hydrophilic structurant, whether predominantly soap) is also<br>
25  important.<br>
U.S. 2004/0223993 to Clapp disclose particles which are hydrophobically modified for incorporation into a large drop oil phase leading to enhanced deposition.  Particles of the 30  subject application are part of a deposition chemistry<br>
(e.g., where anionic surfactant and cationic polymer coat<br><br>
WO 2007/101586<br><br>
PCT/EP2007/001703<br><br>
-   4   -<br>
particle individually), and are not part of a large drop oil phase (e.g., where deposition is dependent on incorporation of particle into large oil drops).<br>
5  The foam/particle structure of the subject invention is important in determining that most particles deposit from the foam portion rather than the liquor portion of the rinse {these fractions are formed in use during rinse) because, when delivered primarily by lather contact rather than by 10  direct contact (deposition from floc), there is not<br>
deposition in crevices (e.g., of the palm of the bands) which is often perceived as negative by consumers.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION 15<br>
In one embodiment, the present invention provides, in particular, bar compositions comprising:<br>
(1) 5% to 90% by wt., preferably 10 to 60%, more preferably 20      12 to 30% by wt. of surfactant selected from the group consisting of anionic, nonionic, amphoteric, and cationic surfactants and mixtures thereof; bars of the invention should preferably have at least 25% anionic surfactant (i.e., anionic should comprise at least 25%, 25      preferably at least 50% of the surfactant system) .  In one specific embodiment, the bars should comprise 4 0 to 90% fatty acid soap (e.g., 40 to 90% of total composition);<br>
30  (2) 0.1% to 80%, preferably 20 to 70% by wt. of hydrophilic water-soluble or water insoluble hydrophilic structurant<br><br>
WO 2007/101586<br><br>
PCT/EP2007/001703<br><br>
-   5   -<br>
(e.g., PEG, starches etc.); when composition is a predominantly soap-based composition (e.g., comprises 40-90% soap), levels of structurant are generally on lower order, e.g., 1.0 to 40%, preferably 2 to 30%, more 5      preferably 2 to 25%;<br>
(3)	0.1 to 20%, preferably 0.2 to 10% by wt. of a deposition<br>
enhancement system (e.g., cationic polymer and anionic<br>
surfactant which can precipitate when combined with the<br>
10      cationic polymer);<br>
wherein molecule or molecules forming said deposition enhancement system form an individual coating in situ on about 50% to 100%, preferably at least 60% of particles<br>
15      of (5) below, such that said individually coated<br>
particles attach individually to bubbles formed during rinse (foam/particle) allowing particles to deposit by lather contact from the foam particle structures as formed;<br>
20<br>
(4)	0 to 10%, preferably 0.1 to 5% by wt. emollient, wherein<br>
said emollient is deposited through the individualized<br>
in situ coatings (preferably) , and/or through any more<br>
"generalized" deposition that may be present in the<br>
25      formulation;<br>
(5)	0.1 to 15%, preferably 0.5 to 10% by wt. of solid<br>
particulate optical modifier wherein said modifier is<br>
flat, platy particulate having D50 size range (e.g.,<br>
30      median of particle size distribution) of 6 to 70<br>
micrometer and thickness of 50 to 1000 nanometer; and<br><br>
WO 2007/101586<br><br>
PCT/EP2007/001703<br><br>
-   6   -<br>
(6) 1 to 20%, preferably 5 to 18% by wt. water;<br>
wherein from at least 50 to 100% of said platy particles deposit predominately from surface of foam 5      (foam/particle) generated during rinse (e.g., due to their deposition chemistry defined by (3) above);<br>
said foam-platy particle structure delivering sensory moisturization feel {measured by rheological 10      measurements of foam, i.e., foam lather; and/or by post-tactile sensory acoustical data).<br>
In one embodiment of this invention, the composition comprise 5 to 60% non-soap surfactant and 20 to 80% 15  hydrophilic structurant.  In a separate embodiment, the invention is directed to soap based bars which more preferably comprise 40 to 90% soap and 0.1 to 40% hydrophilic surfactant.<br>
20  Because the optical particles are delivered from a foam<br>
particle structure, they provide both a visual effect (from the particles) and a moisturizing effect (from foam sensory effect) .  Thus, the flat platy particles have dual use sensory effect (i.e., optical and moisturizing).<br>
25<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to bar compositions comprising<br>
5  platy particulate particles wherein said particles form a foam-platy particle structure during rinse such that a predominance (&gt;50%, preferably &gt;60%, e.g., 60-100% or 60 to 95%) of such particles are delivered to the skin from the foam-particle structure (Figure 4) rather than from a floc<br>
0  deposition system (Figures 1 and 2).  Preferably less than 20%, more preferably less than 15%, even more preferably less than 10% of particles are delivered through flocculation.  It is possible no particles are delivered through flocculation at all.<br>
5<br>
The delivery from foam-particle structures not only permits delivery of visual effect (from the particles), but also creates a moisturizing sensation simultaneous with delivery of the optical effect.<br>
0<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, the invention relates to a process for delivering a dual optical (e.g., brightening) and moisturizing effect by  using bar compositions as defined above and subsequently rinsing with<br>
5  water.<br>
The invention is defined in greater detail as noted below.<br>
In general, the surfactant system of the invention used is 0  also not critical.  It is, however, preferred that there be present at least one lathering anionic surfactant.<br><br><br>
WO 2007/101586<br><br>
-   10   -<br>
Preferably such anionic should comprise at least 25%  of the total surfactant concentration.<br>
Broadly, surfactant is present at level of 5 to 90%, 5  preferably 10 to 60% by wt. of composition.<br>
In one embodiment, the surfactant system is predominantly soap based (40-90% soap), although levels of synthetic, non-soap less than the level of soap may be used.  In this 10  embodiment, level of synthetic, if present at all, is 0 to 30%, preferably 0 to 20% by wt. of the composition.<br>
In general, the surfactant is selected from the group consisting of soap (including pure soap systems), anionic<br>
15  surfactant, nonionic surfactant, amphoteric/zwitterionic surfactant, cationic surfactant and mixtures thereof.  As noted below, when a predominantly soap system is used (40-90% by wt. composition), generally less hydrophilic structurant (e.g., 0.1 to 40%) is required for individual<br>
20  coated particle effect.<br>
Non-limiting examples of anionic surfactants are disclosed in McCutcheon's Detergents and Emulsifiers, North American Edition (1986), published by Allured Publishing Corporation; 25  McCutcheon's Functional materials. North Americas Edition<br>

25  Cationic Surfactants<br>
Cationic surfactants are another useful class of surfactants that can be employed as auxiliary agents.  They are particularly useful as additives to enhance skin feel, and 3 0  provide skin conditioning benefits.  One class of cationic surfactants is heterocyclic ammonium salts such as cetyl or<br><br>

trimethyl ammonium chloride or bromide; hydrogenated palm or tallow trimethylammonium halides; behenyl trimethyl ammonium halides or methyl sulfates; decyl isononyl dimethyl ammonium halides; ditallow  (or distearyl) dimethyl ammonium halides; 10  behenyl dimethy ammonium chloride.<br>
Other types of cationic surfactants that can be employed are the various ethoxylated quaternary amines and ester quats. Examples are PEG-5 stearyl ammonium lactate (e.g., Genamin<br>
15  KSL manufactured by Clarion), PEG-2 coco ammonium chloride, PEG-15 hydrogenated  tallow ammonium chloride,   PEG 15  stearyl ammonium chloride, dialmitoyl ethyl methyl ammonium chloride, dipalmitoyl hydroxyethyl methyl sulfate, strearyl amidopropyl dimethylamine lactate.<br>

The surfactants, along with cationic polymer, form a coating 25  in situ on the platy particles individually upon dilution or usage of the product.  The coated platy particles are then capable of forming a foam particle structure when foam is formed during rinse.  It is because of this structure that at least 50%, preferably at least 60% and up to 100% of 30  optical particles are then delivered from foam rather than by typical flocculation deposition.<br><br>

Structurant<br>
The structurant of the invention can be a water-soluble or water insoluble hydrophilic structurant.  In the subject 5  application, structurant forms at least 0.1 to 80% of the composition.  In one embodiment of the invention, compositions are predominantly no soap or low-soap compositions comprising 15 to 60% non-soap synthetic surfactants (and less than 15%, preferably less than 10%, 10  preferably less than 5%, preferably less than 1% soap; soap may be absent altogether).  For such compositions, structurant is preferably present at 20 to 80%, preferably 30 to 70% by wt.<br>
15  In the soap-based embodiment, structurant is preferably<br>
present at 0.1 to 40%, preferably 2 to 30%, more preferably 2 to 25% by wt.<br>
Water soluble structurants include moderately high molecular 20  weight polyalkylene oxides of appropriate melting point (e.g. 40°  to 100°C,  preferably 50° to 90°C) and in particular polyethylene glycols or mixtures thereof.<br>
Polyethylene glycols (PEG's) which are used may have a 25  molecular weight in the range 50 to 25,000 preferably 100 to 10,000.  However, in some embodiments of this invention it is preferred to include a fairly small quantity of polyethylene glycol with a molecular weight in the range from 50,000 to 500,000, especially molecular weights of 30  around 100,000.  Such polyethylene glycols have been found to improve the wear rate of the bars.  It is believed that<br><br>
WO 2007/101586<br><br>
PCT/EP2007/001703<br><br>
-   22   -<br>
this is because their long polymer chains remain entangled even when the bar composition is wetted during use.<br>
If such high molecular weight polyethylene glycols {or any<br>
5  other water soluble high molecular weight polyalkylene<br>
oxides) are used, the quantity is preferably from 1% to 5%, more preferably from 1% or 1.5% to 4% or 4.5% by weight of the composition. These materials will generally be used jointly with a large quantity of other Water-soluble<br>
0  structurant such as the above mentioned polyethylene glycol of molecular weight 50 to 25,000, preferably 100 to 10,000. If PEGs are used, they should preferably not be used in amounts greater than about 20% by wt. as they may induce flocculation.<br>
5<br>
Water insoluble hydrophilic structurants also have a melting point in the range 40° to 100°C, more preferably at least 50°C, notably 50°C. to 90°C.  Suitable materials which are particularly envisage are fatty acid soaps, particularly<br>
0  those having a carbon chain of 12 to 24 carbon atoms.<br>
Examples are soaps, lauric, myristic, palmitic, stearic, arachidic and behenic acids and mixtures thereof.  Sources of these fatty acids are coconut, topped coconut, palm, palm kernel, babassu and tallow fatty acids and partially or<br>
5  fully hardened fatty acids or distilled fatty acids.  Other suitable water insoluble structurants include alkenols of 8 to 20 carbon atoms, particularly cetyl alcohol-  These materials generally have a water solubility of less than 5 g/litre at 20°C.  When used in a predominantly soap<br>
0  composition (40-90% soap), the soap functions as both<br>
surfactant and structurant.  When used in a predominantly<br><br>
WO 2007/101586<br><br>
PCT/EP2007/001703<br><br>
-   23   -<br>
synthetic, non-soap or low soap composition, it functions as a structurant and comprises generally less than 15% by wt., preferably less than 10% and may be absent altogether.<br>
5  The relative proportions of the water-soluble hydrophilic structurants and water insoluble hydrophilic structurants govern the rate at which the bar wears during use.  The presence of the water-insoluble structurant tends to delay dissolution of the bar when exposed to water during use and 10  hence retard the rate of wear.<br>
As indicated the structurant is used broadly in the bar in an amount of 0.1% to 80%, preferably 20% to 70% by wt., depending on type of surfactant base.<br>
15<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the structurant comprises predominantly water-soluble structurant.  Hydrophobic structurant (e.g., free fatty acids, wax) should comprise no more than 25%, preferably no more than 10% of structurant<br>
20  system; and such hydrophobic structurant should comprise no more than 25%, preferably less than 20%; more preferably less than 15% by wt. of bar overall.<br>
By water soluble is meant generally that 1% or more of 2 5  compound is soluble in water at room temperature.<br>
Deposition Enhancement System<br>
The deposition enhancement system of the invention, as 30  noted, is unique in that platy optical modifier particles (i.e. , predominance, if not all) . individually comprise the<br><br>

system (Figure 3) thereof allowing the particles to deposit from the rinse.  That is the platy particles are individually coated, for example, with cationic polymer/anionic surfactant, thereby permitting the particles 5  to attach to the foam and form a particle-foam structure (upon creation of foam on rinse (see Figure 4)), thereby allowing majority of particles to deposit directly from said rinse.  A typical deposition system present in the particles comprises as follows: 10<br>
a)	from about 0.1 to about 10% by wt., preferably 0.1 to 8%<br>
by wt. of a cationic polymer, preferably having change<br>
density ≥1 Meq/gram, and<br>
b)	about 0.1 to 30% by wt. , preferably o.5% to 25% by wt.<br>
15      of an anionic surfactant which form% a precipitate with<br>
cationic polymer upon dilution.<br>
Emollient<br>
2 0  The deposition system (which deposits on  the particle<br>
surface during dilution in use) may also comprise 0 to 10%, preferably 0.1 to 10% by wt. emollient Although emollient need not be part of the deposition system at all.<br>
25  Examples of emollients which may be useq include glycerin, alkylene glycols (e.g., ethylene or propylene glycol or mixtures thereof) and primary, secondary and/or tertiary amines.  A preferred amine is trialkanolamine such as triethanolamine.  Another preferred emollient is urea.<br>
30  Mixtures of any or all of the above emollients may be used.<br><br>

Said emollient(s) further aid deposition of the optical<br>
modifiers.<br>
As for the deposition system, typically the cationic polymer 5  and anionic surfactant (e.g., anionic surfactant) can form a precipitate on individual particles upon dilution as noted.<br>
Example of surfactants which can be used in the deposition system (whether forming floc or individually attach to each 0  particle) include C10 - C24 fatty acid soaps  (e.g.,<br>
laurates), alkyl taurate (e.g., cocoyl methyl taurate or other alkyl taurates), sulfosuccinates, alkyl sulfates, glycinates, sarcosinates and mixtures thereof.<br>
5  It is preferred that the cationic have the noted charge in order to form the precipitate.  The polymers may be modified polysaccharides including cationic guar gums, synthetic cationic polymers, cationic starches, etc.<br>
0  Specific cationic polymers which are to be used include Merquat® polymers such as polyquaternium 6 (e.g., Merquat®100 or Salcare®SC30) and polyquatrnium7 (e.g. Merquat®2200 or Salcare®SC10); guar gums and/or derivatives (e.g.  Jaguar CI7); quaternized<br>

The deposition system (cationic polymer/anionic surfactant) forms an integral structure with the foam bubbles (on each individual bubble (see Figure 4)) which, when foam and liquor portions are also formed during rinse, allows 5  foam/particles to deposit from the foam portion (lather deposition) rather than by flocculation from liquor (directly) .  The deposited particles can be broken by shear/rubbing to form a uniform and dispersed film (comprising optical particles) on surface of substrate.  It 10  should be noted that non-platy particles (e.g., pigmentary TiO2) do not form this structure (see Figure 1).<br>
The oil/emollient, whether or not part of deposition system can be, for example, silicone, castor oil, and sunflower 15  seed oil.  Emollient can be deposited through the<br>

20  A piece of black porcine skin is used {L = 40 ±3), where skin has dimensions of 5.0 cm by 10 cm, and the skin is mounted on black background paper card. Initial measurements of untreated skin are made. The mounted skin is then washed and rinsed with 0.2 g of liquid wash-off formulation or soap<br>
25  bar. After two (2) hours of drying, final measurements are made.<br>
Color Measurements<br>
30  Initial and final color measurements were made of porcine or in-vivo human skin using a Hunter Lab spectra colormeter<br><br>
WO 2007/101586<br><br>
PCT/EP2007/001703<br><br>
-   33   -<br>
using a 0° light source and 45° detector geometry.  The spectra colormeter was calibrated with the appropriately black and white standards.  Measurements were made before and after wash treatment.  Three measurements were made each 5  time and averaged.  Values of L, a*, and b*, which came from the L a* b* color space representation, were obtained in this manner.  L measures units of  "Lightness", a* measures values from red to green and b* measures values from yellow to blue. 10<br>
Reflectance (Gloss) Determination<br>
Initial and final reflectance/radiance measurements of porcine or in-vivo human skin was made with a glossmeter 15  which measures units of gloss.  The glossmeter was first set with both detector and light source at 85° from normal.  The glossmeter was calibrated with appropriate reflection standard.<br>
2 0  Measurements of gloss were taken before and after<br>
application of formulation and A gloss was calculated to obtain percent difference.<br>
Opacity Determination<br>
25<br>
Opacity of washable deposition was calculated from Hunter Lab color measurements. Opacity contrast was calculated from AL (change in whiteness after deposition compared to prior to deposition) divided by 60 (which is the difference<br>
30  in L value of skin and a pure white color).<br><br>

Method to determine partition of Particle in Liquor / Foam Phase (i.e., how much of optical particles is in liquor and how much is in foam) -.<br>
5      100g. of 1% Soap solution was made by dissolving soap<br>
shaving on Stirrer bar (-15  - 20 Minutes) . The solution was transferred to a separating funnel and the lather was generated by shaking the separating funnel for 20 times.  The foam/liquor phases were allowed to separate<br>
10      for about 30 seconds, and they were drained in separate beakers.  The particles were filtered from each layer by filtering through 1.2 μ  tare, filter paper under vacuum. All soluble materials were removed by washing the particles with hot water, and then hot alcohol.  The<br>
15      filter paper was dried in vacuum oven @45°C over night.<br>
The weight fraction of the particles in each phase was then determined by weighing on analytical balance.<br>
2 0  Protocol for Squeeze Force Test (Quantification of Cushioning and/or Lubricating Behavior):<br>
Handwash (for generating lather to be measured in squeeze force test):<br>
25<br>
•	Handwash under tap water @ room temperature.<br>
•	Wet the bar; rotate in water 10 times; rotate in hands 12 times.<br>
•	Collect lather; measure total weight and density.<br>

Squeeze Test:<br><br>
WO 2007/101586<br><br>
PCT/EP2007/001703<br><br>
-   35   -Test  Type<br>
•	Parallel plate geometry (ARES Rheometer) was used.<br>
5<br>
•	Test Type: Multiple Extension Mode Test in Predefined<br>
Test Setup using strain controlled in transient mode.<br>
Experimental Conditions: 10<br>
•	The initial gap set between parallel plates was 2.0 mm<br>
•	The 1st time zone is the initial experimental time duration, that is 2 seconds (i.e., the distance between<br>
15       two plates going from starting or initial position {2mm) to final position (0.238 mm) is traveled in 2 seconds), measured using a constant Hencky ratio of -1.0.<br>
20  •   As noted, Hencky ratio (1/s, Ad/Displacement<br>
Xl/time=constant) was used to apply constant rate of strain to the tested sample and the test was used to determine squeeze flow. Linear displacement rate is adjusted to maintain a constant sample strain rate.<br>
25       Hencky ratio is in logarithmic scale, so that Hencky ratio of -1 .= 1/10 or 10% displacement.<br>
•	The test is used to measure the extensional modulus and<br>
properties in samples such as lubrication/cushioning.<br><br>
WO 2007/101586<br><br>
PCT/EP2007/001703<br><br>
-   36   -<br>
•   The 2nd time zone was 30 seconds (during which<br>
experimental data is collected) with Hencky ratio of 0 in order for sample to reach equilibrium; the normal force remains almost constant during this period. 5<br>
In essence, the lather/bubbles are placed between 2 parallel plates and force is applied onto upper plate downward against lather (as noted above).  The resistance of the 0  lather to compression is an indication of the perceived "lubrication" of the foam to the consumer, e.g., more resistance is correlated with enhanced lubricating.<br>
Acoustic rinse test 5<br>
Background:<br>
The test involves the use of sound recording to report the contact mechanic events that occur during skin to skin<br>
0  contacts. The acoustic instrument detects skin vibration signals and the sound emission generated during rinsing events. This technique is use to correlate these events to tactile perception. This correlation is based on the acoustic spectra that is generated to provide a tactile<br>
5  impression. These physical signals passing through skin affect consumer perception.<br>
Acoustic rinse protocol:<br>

Generally, working examples are those where most of optical effect is seen from lather contact (deposition from 10  foam/particle structure) rather than from direct contact (e.g., as floc).<br>
Comparative D (Comparative) shows no deposition (very little gloss or L change) because it has no deposition chemistry or 15  hydrophilic structurants.<br>
Example 1 (Sugar, TCM, cationic) shows very high gloss values, indicating good deposition efficiency and shine/radiant effects. The deposition is coming from 20  predominately lather contact over direct product contact. Visual and quantitative evaluation show the TCM is predominately carried in the foam/lather when using the product (see next section and Figure 4). Microscopic<br><br>

PCT/EP2007/001703<br><br>

observations show particles are not flocced but individually dispersed/suspended (see Figure 3) .  It does not show the negative effects of direct contact, such as deposition on the palms of the hands. 5<br>
Comparatives A, B and C show very high gloss values, indicating good deposition efficiency and shine/radiant effects. The deposition is coining from predominately direct product contact over foam/lather contact.  Microscopic<br>
10  observations show particles are floced and not individually dispersed/suspended (see Figure 2).  In visual and quantitative evaluation, the TCM is predominately transferred/deposited via direct contact when using the product. Very little TCM is seen in the foam/lather (see<br>
15  next section) . It does show the negative effects of direct contact, such as deposition on the palms of the hands.<br>
These four examples (1 and Comparatives A-C) show that deposition chemistry and hydrophilic structuring is critical 20  for good deposition, but having the deposition coming from the foam/lather is critical (which only Example 1 shows).<br>
Examples 2, 3, and 4 show very high gloss values, indicating good deposition efficiency and shine/radiant effects. The<br>
25  deposition is coming from predominately lather contact over direct product contact. Microscopic observations show particles are not floced but individually dispersed/suspended (see Figure 3).  In visual and quantitative evaluation, the TCM is predominately carried in<br>
30  the foam/lather when using the product (see next section and Figure 4) . It does not show the negative effects of direct<br><br>

PCT/EP2007/001703<br><br>

contact, such as deposition on the palms of the hands. Example 2 shows higher gloss values than Example 4 because of use of hydrophilic structurants in the formulation. Example 3 has higher gloss values because of higher 5  deposition efficiency from the foam/lather (more TCM in<br>
foam/lather, see next section) due to the use of metal soap treatment.<br>
Example 5 10<br>
Distribution of TCM during use of examples and deposition characteristics<br>
In general {when looking at Examples 1, 2, 3 and Comparative<br>
15  C in Figure 5), it can be seen that the more hydrophilic<br>
structuring, correct surface treatment with deposition<br>
chemistry, the more material the foam lather holds. Note, as<br>
seen in Figure 5, Comparative C has a 1OW amount of material<br>
in the foam/lather<br>
20<br>
Example 6<br>
Figure 6 shows the relationship of amount of particles in foam to visual gloss effect from foam/lather deposition. 25  More material (TCM) in the foam/lather, the higher the gloss of the deposition (more TCM deposited).  Note, because Comparative C has a low amount of TCM in the foam/lather, the resulting shine/gloss change is less (less material deposited) and not plotted on the graph.<br><br><br>
WO 2007/101586<br><br>

Example  7<br>
In-use moisturization feel and smooth skin after feel characteristics 5<br>
Figure 7 shows the squeeze force of the foam/lather for Example 2 and the effect of the key components. Example A is Example 2 but without the TCM or the deposition chemistry (cationic polymer, PEG, etc.). Example B is Example 2<br>
10  without the TCM, but with the deposition chemistry.  Example C is Example 2 without the deposition chemistry, but with the TCM. The importance of the squeeze force in foam/lather is that the higher the squeeze force value, the cushionier and moisturizing feel the lather/foam has.<br>
15<br>
As seen from Figure 7, Examples A and B have effectively the same value. This means that the deposition chemistry by it's self does not give the moisturizing lather/foam feel. Example C has a significant increase in squeeze force<br>
20  indicating that the flat platy TCM does contribute to the moisturizing feel of the foam/lather. The flat platy TCM particles are being incorporated into the foam/lather, forming a structure, which increases the squeeze flow. Example 2 has the highest squeeze force value of all the<br>
25  examples (much higher than Example C) . This shows a non<br>
obvious synergistic effect of the flat platy TCM, with the deposition chemistry coated on its surface, creating a foam/lather structure which has a moisturizing lather/foam feel.<br><br>

Example   8<br>
Smooth skin after feel and deposition.<br>
5  Using the examples of the previous section, the effects of Example 2 components on smooth skin after feel are seen. The acoustical patterns (in Figure 8) show how smooth the skin feels from the friction noise.<br>
10  Example A (no TCM and no deposition chemistry) and B (only deposition chemistry) shows no significant difference in acoustical patterns. Example C shows an amplitude attenuation (from ±  12 in Examples A and B   to ±  4 in example C) of the friction noise, which shows a degree of<br>
15  smooth skin after feel. Example 2 shows a significant change in the acoustical pattern. It shows not only amplitude attenuation as in Example C but also the delay time of amplitude friction noise, with values of ≥ ± 4 (all of the examples show a delay time -8 sec, while Example 2 has a<br>
20  delay time of -24 sec), is increased. This is a non obvious and synergistic effect of the flat platy TCM with the deposition chemistry coated on its surface.<br><br>
