				<td>Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to sustained release pharmaceutical compositions for the parenteral administration of active ingredients which are hydrophilic or are made hydrophilic by suitable derivatization, in the loon of stable, biologically compatible and easily preparable water-in-oil rmcroemulsions (w/o). More particularly, pepiide active ingredients or biologically active oligo- or polysaceharidtes, for which protection from the immediate attack by the hydrolytic enzymes present in living organisms as well as sustained release in time, to avoid repeated administrations, tre desirable, are advantageously formulated through said microemulsions. Said formulations for the therapeutical use can be injected without problems or significant side effects and are easily prepared industrially, providing a remarkable technical improvement<br>
Prior art<br>
Microemulsions can be generally defined as optically isotropic systems, not birifrangent under polarized light observation, transparent, thermodynamically stable, of extremely reduced size, with droplet diameter ranging from 5 to 200 run, produced by dispersion of two immiscible liquids which are stabilized by the presence of emulsifiers, which modify the chemical-physical properties of the separation surface between the two liquids, reducing substantially to zero the interfacial tension. An oil, water, a surfactant or tenside and optionally of a co-surfactant o co-tenside should usually be present for microemulsions to form; the tendency to form a water-in-oil (w/o) or oil-in-water (o/w) microemulsion depends on the mutual proportions of<br>
aqueous and oily phases as well as on the nature of the surfactant. In particular, ternary phase diagrams having as components water, a hydrophobic compound and a mixture of surfactant and co-surfactant, obtained according to experimental data, allow to single out the area in which w/o and o/w microemulsions exist and are stable. For example, Aboofazeli et at (Int.J.Pharm. Ill (1994) 63-72) studied the capability of various compounds having co-surfactant action to form w/o anicroemulsions. The system studied by the Authors consisted of mixtures of a fatty acid ester, a 1:1 lecithin-co-surfactant and water in various ratios. An efficiency scale of tile compounds used as co-surfactants has been defined: primary amines &gt; alcohols&gt; fatty acids. Furthermore, the efficiency proved to be related with the length of the alkyl chain of the alcohol and of tile respective fatty acid; hence butanol&gt;pentanol&gt;hexanol&gt; pentanoie acid&gt;hexanoic acid. On the basis of these experimental data, alcohols such as butanol and pentanol and, to a less extent, the corresponding fatty acids, appear to be the best candidates. The use of the described compounds allows to prepare stable w/o microcmulsions, but does not ensure the tolerability of said formulations,, particularly for the depot use wherein the formulation and the subcutaneous or intramuscular tissue remain in contact for days or even weeks.<br>
Moreover, literature reports that the co-surfactaat to surfactant ratio is critical; the data reported by Aboofazeli et at, relate to a 1:1 ratio between the two components. Atwood et al (Int.J.Pharmacy 84 R5 (1992)} studied the behaviour of lecithin/water/fatty acid ester/butanol mixtures wherein the surfactant/co-surfactant ratio is increased from about 1,7 to 3. The Authors evidenced that the decrease of the co-surfactant amount in favor of lecithin dramatically restricts the area in which the presence of a w/o microcraulsion is observed, even when using a remarkably efficient co-surfactant such as butanol.<br>
Surfactants are generally classified according to m empirical scale, known as hydrophile-lipophile balance (HLB) which assignee values ranging from 1 to 40. As a rule, suitable surfactants for w/o microemulsions have low HLB whereas those suitable fox o/w microemuUions have high HLB. When the interfacial tension is 
The numerous advantages of the use of a mi croemulsion as a carrier for active ingredients are known,<br>
Microemulsions, under specific conditions of ratios between the components, can form spontaneously without need for high power for the preparation thereof; therefore their preparation on an industrial scale can be easy. Said spontaneous microemulsions are thermodynamically stable, homogeneous and transparent, so that they can be monitored by spectroscopicsl techniques. Microemulsions with mean diameters 
Furthermore said systems can undergo phase inversion when an excess of the dispersed phase is present, or as a consequence of a change of<br>
temperature: this property can affect the bioavailability of the active ingredient with a mechanism that has not yet been clarified.<br>
The w/o microemulsions can control the release of the active ingredient or protract its stability in physiologic fluids through protection from the action of hydrolytic enzymes. A number of reviews on microemulsions exist, for example "Industrial application of microemulsions" Marcel Dekker Ed, 1997, which in the chapter "Microemulsions in the Pharmaceutical field: perspectives and applications" deals wila tihe usefulness thereof in the pharmaceutical field, and "Handbook of Micjoetmilsion Technology", Ed. Kumar Mittal (1999) concerning the chemical-physical aspects.<br>
The use of w/o microemulsions as vehicles to obtain a controlled release of active ingredients which are hydrophilic or are made hydrophilic by suitable derivatization, is reported in the patent literature.<br>
In particular, as for biodegradable molecules such as peptides, the parentcral administration of w/o microemulsions containing said active ingredients is reported in a study [M.R.Gasco et al, Int.J.Pharm., 62, 119 (1990)] wherein an LHRH hormone analog, formulated in a microemulsion consisting of components considered biocompatible and containing 500 jig/ml of the active ingredient,, administered by single intramuscular injection at doses of 3 mg/Kg in adult male rats weighing about 200 g, decreased testosterone plasma levels for a time up to about 30 days after the injection; said levels were lower man those observed in a second group of mice treated with repeated injections (one a day for 28 days) at doses of 100 fig/Kg of active ingredient in buffer solution.<br>
It should however be noted that the decrease in the testosterone concentration was not homogeneous in time during observation, and it became therapcutically effective only 8 days after the administration.<br>
This  delay  in  the therapeutical  effect  is   not  very  advantageous,<br>
particularly in the treatment of prostate tumor which is known to require testosterone for growing; therefore the faster the testosterone normal production is stopped, the more effective the treatment.<br>
The above mentioned paper shows the effectiveness of a w/o microemulsion consisting of ethyl oleate (60.5%), water (10J%), phosphatidyl choline (18.9%) and caproic acid (10.5%) for ihe= sustained release of the peptide. The surfactant (phosphatidylcholine) to co-surfactant (caproic acid) ratio is 1,8. The components of said microemulsiO'n, individually taken, are considered biologically compatible by the Authors. No mention is nude of the biocompatibility of the microemulsion as a whole neither of the condition of the subcutaneous tissue in contact with the formulation.<br>
According to the teaching of said paper, a w/o microermilsion containing Leuprolide acetate as active ingredient with LHBLH activity was prepared, consisting of ethyl oleate (66.9%), water (9.7%), phosphatidyl choline (19.4%) and a caproic acid/butyric acid 3/1 mixture (3.9%). According to this paper, the mixture with butyric acid was used instead of caproic acid alone in order to minimize the surfactant to co-surfactant ratio, which is in this case 4.9 instead af 1.8. The in vivo test carried out by subcutaneous injection of the product in the rat has confirmed tile effectiveness but has also surprisingly shown ilanning local ulcerogenicity and persistent formation of subcutaneous granulomas. This pharmacologically unacceptable result, notwithstanding the lower amounts of co-surfactants used, proved that the biocompatibility of the single components of the microemulsion was not sufficient to ensure the jiocompatibility of the mixture constituting the microemulsion, when used for he parenteral administration,<br>
Similarly, the mixtures disclosed and claimed in various patents, e.g. WO 94/08610, although providing stable micioemulsions and possible ;ontrolled releases of the active ingredient in time, do not teach to those skilled<br>
in the art how to obtain the sustained release of an hydrophilic active ingredient while avoiding such side effects. Said microemuisions usually consist, in fact, of water, an oily component, a surfactant, a co-surfactant, and optionally electrolytes, in various ratios. Neither biooompatibility of the microermilsion "in toton is evaluated, nor the necessary ratios of mixture components to active ingredient are indicated, to obtain stability of both the active ingredient and the microemulsion as well as biocorapatibility of the formulation.<br>
On the other hand, said patents did not specifically consider the problems concerning local tolerability connected with intramuscular (i.m.) and subcutaneous (s.c.) administrations, which are the most suitable and easy routes for the parenteral administration.<br>
An alternative technology already used at the industrial level for the sustained release of peptides is that described and claimed in t number of patents, inter alia US 3,976,071, wherein such release is obtained by the use of bioerodible polymers in which the active ingredient is inbodyrated. Typical examples of bioerodible polymers are polymers based on glycolic acid aid lactic acid. The drawback of said technology is that it is relatively expensive and troublesome compared with the above described microemuisions, furthermore it requires the use of organic, in particular chlorinated, solvents during the preparation, which involves problems in terms of environmental impact and safety of the pharmaceutical formulation.<br>
On the other hand, said formulations advantageously cause not persistent granulomas and do not induce local ulccrogenicity.<br>
Disclosure of the invention<br>
The present invention aims at providing sustained release pharmaceutical compositions in the form of stable w/o microemuisions, which are easy to prepare, can be sterilized, are free from remarkable systemic or topical side effects, are suitable for parenterally administering, preferably i.m. or s.c.,<br>
active ingredients which are hydrophilic or are made hydrophilic through suitable deiivatization, thereby obtaining a remarkable technical improvement compared with the known technique.<br>
A procedure has been found, consisting in the clinical, post-mortem, and histological examinations of the animals treated with the above mentioned microemulsions, suitable for thoroughly evaluating the biocompatibility of any formulations for the sustained release administration.<br>
According to this procedure, a microemulsion is considered acceptable, according to what stated in literature (Protein Formulation and Delivery -EXMcKelly 2000 pages 245-247), when any local swelling, more or less marked depending on the administered dose, is anyway reversible; on the other hand, a similar tissular response is also observed for materials considered biodegradable, which response is apparently important in affecting the sustained release of the drug in time. A local intolerance in the form of persistent ulcerations is conversely considered unacceptable.<br>
The microemulsions of the present invention consists for up to 20% of an internal hydrophilic aqueous phase containing the active ingredient, for 30 to 98% of a hydrophobic external phase and for up to 50% of a surfactant alone or in admixture with a co-surfactant. Hie microemulsion preferably contains a percentage £35% of surfactant and co-surfectant, with a surfactant/co-snrfactant ratio &gt; 2S and most preferably i 3,5.<br>
Other biologically compatible excipients which do not affect die stability of the microemulsion can also be present.<br>
Suitable surfactants for the microemulsions of the invention are selected from natural or synthetic glycerophospholipids containing residues of C4-C2o saturated or unsaturated carboxylic acids, having as phosphoester moiety a residue of choline, ethanolamine, serine, glycerol; cholesterol; Cj2-C20 fatty acid esters of sugars such as sorbitol, galactose, glucose, saccharose;<br>
polyoxyetnylene sorbitan Cu-CM j&amp;rtty acid esters,<br>
The optionally present co-suriactants ore selected horn C8-C20 fatty acids, C2-Ci4 polyhydroxyalkanes, particularly propylenc glycol, hexanediol and glycerol, C2-C12 alcohol*, esters of lactic acid with a C2-C« alcohol residue.<br>
The hydrophobic continuous phase is selected from the following compounds, alone or in mixture: eaters of (VCzo saturated or unsaturated carboxylic acids with a C2-C8 alcohol residue or mono, di- and triglyoerids of C8-C2o fatty acids, or vegetable oils suitable for the parenteral administration, such as soybean, peanut, sesame, cottonseed, sunflower oils.<br>
The microemulsions of the invention are further characterized by pH ranging from 4.5 to 7.5, preferably from 5 to 7, said pH, when not intrinsic to the composition of the microemulsion, being preferably obtained by addition of a suitable amount of a natural amino acid to the microemulsion without affecting its stability and the average size of the droplets.<br>
The w/o microemulsions of the invention are particularly suitable as carriers for peptides, in particular LHRH analogs such as Leuproude acetate, Goserelin, Triptorelin, Nafarelin acetate, Histrelin, Cetrorelix or the corresponding acetates, or peptides such as Somatostatin or its analogs such as Octreotide and Lanreotide acetate.<br>
Furthermore, the microemulsions of the invention are particularly suitable as carriers for polysaccharides, in particular unfractioned heparin or low molecular weight heparins.<br>
The microemulsions of the invention allow to prepare formulations with sustained release of hydrophilic active ingredients. Said sustained release formulations, which are a further object of the invention, induce no local ulcerogenicity and produce non persistent granulomas, which are reabsorbed during the time in which the medicament is effective, tn the case of LHRH-type peptides, and in particular LeuproKde, Goserelin, Triptorelin, Nafarelin acetate,<br>
Histrelin, Cetrorelix and the corresponding acetates, sustained release; for at least ,'&gt;(} days can be obtained. In the case of somatostatin, octreotide and Lanrcotidc, sustained release for at least 8 days can be obtained.<br>
The invention further relates to the use of a microemulsion according to (he invention comprising Leuprolide, Goscrelin, Triptorelin, Nafarclin acetate, Histrelin, Cetroreli.x or the   corresponding   acetates   for   the   preparation   of  a   medicament   for   suppressing testosterone   production   after   single   administration   for   at   least    30   days,   where testosterone level already decreases 48 h after the administration.<br>
The invention also relates to the use of the microcmulsions containing Octreotide or us analogues   for   the   preparation   of a  medicament   for   suppressing   growth   hmmoiH production for at least 8 days.<br>
A further object of the present invention is the use of the microernulsions coniaimn; unfractioned heparin or low molecular weight heparins for the preparation of sustained release medicament upon single administration.<br>

Testosterone plasma levels after taking the Mood samples were evaluated at days 1, 2, 3,4, 7, 14,21, 28, 42 and 56. Blood samples were centrifuged and serum testosterone was measured by EIA kit<br>
Serum testosterone levels were evaluated until 60 days after administration.<br>
The results are described m Figure L<br>
The following Table 1 summarizes the data concerning organs weight in the treated animals.<br>
Table 1 - Effect of the microeraulsions prepared as described in Examples 1 and 2 on body and reproductive organs weight in rats.<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
The formulations of the present invention, independently on Che concentration of the active in the rnkfoeandsioii, are free ficom substantial systemic or local side effects and provide the sustained release of the active ingredient for a duration of at least 30 days and therapeutic efficacy already 48 h after the injection.<br>
The efficacy is comparable to that obtainable when using the commercial depot formulation "Eoantone" based on bioerodible polymers, Example   16   -   Evaluation   of  the   subcutaneous   tolerability   of  the microemulsions<br>
The test for the evaluation of the subcutaneous tolerabiljty was effected by injecting groups of at least 9 rate with a single administration of the microemulsions reported in the following Table 2.<br>
Clinical, post-mortem and histologic examinations were carried out 48h, 7 days and 14 days alter the administration. Table 2<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
(1)	Microemulsion prepared as described in Example 1.<br>
(2)	Microemulsion prepared as described in Example 8,<br>
* disclosure of the score: 1 slight effect; 2 moderate; 3 severe. This  test considers biologically compatible the  formulations which induce no persistent local ulcerations, whereas the presence of swelling is a<br>
function of the amount of product injected and of the rate of elimination of the ethyl oleate from subcutaneous tissues, as described by Howard et al. in Int. J. Pharm, 16(1983)31-39.<br>
Example 17 - In vivo evaluation of me effectiveness of the microemulsion containing Octreotide acetate<br>
A dose corresponding to 6 mg/rat of microemulsion containing Octreotide prepared as described in Example 11 was administered to 6 male rats weighing about 175-200 g. Plasma samples were taken before the administration of the compound and 0.5 hours, 24 hours, 4, 6 and 8 days after treatment.<br>
Octreotide was extracted from plasma and analyzed with LC-MS-MS apparatus vs. a calibration curve. Plasma levels are reported in the following table 3: Table 3<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Significant Octreotide plasma levels were found until S days after treatment. Example 18 - Evaluation of the dose/efficacy ratio of the microemulsion containing Leuprolide acetate<br>
The formulation containing Leuprolide acetate, prepared as described in Example 2, was administered to rats, in a single dose of 2.25 mg/Jcg (Example). Control animals received a corresponding dose of saline solution (Control).<br>
Testosterone plasma levels on blood samples were evaluated at days 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 14, 21, 28, 42 and 56. Blood samples were centrifuged and serum testosterone was measured by an Eiisa kit.<br>
Results are shown in Figure 2.<br>
The data concerning organs weights in treated animals are summarized in the following Table 4,<br>
Table 4: Effect of a Leuprolide acetate microemulsion or of a saline solution on the body and reproductive organs weight in rftts (Example and Control).<br>
Body and reproductive organs weight (g) on 56 day<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Reduction of both testosterone plasma levels and reproductive organs weight is clearly evidenced 56 days after the administration of the microemulsion.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
