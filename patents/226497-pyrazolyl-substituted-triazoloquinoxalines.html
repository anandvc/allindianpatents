				<td>Pyrazolyl-Substituted Triazoloqninoxalines<br>
The invention relates to pyrazolyl-substituted triazoloquinoxalines, their analogous<br>
tetrazoloquinoxalines as well as their pharmaceutically compatible salts, their production as well<br>
as their use as pharmaceutical agents for treating diseases in the kidney area (as K+-saving<br>
diuretic agents, for acute renal failure, for nephritis, for hepatorenal syndrome); for treating the<br>
heart (preferably in the case of cardiac irregularities, ischemia, myocardial infarction or angina<br>
pectoris); the central nervous system (for dementia, Alzheimer's disease, anxiety disorders,<br>
epilepsy, Parkinson's disease, stroke, depression, opiate withdrawal and comatose conditions);<br>
and for treating the lungs (for therapy of respiratory diseases, for example asthma, bronchitis and<br>
mucoviscidosis as well as protective agents for a lung transplant). In addition, the invention<br>
comprises pharmaceutical agents for treating hypertension, allergic skin diseases (urticaria),<br>
inflammations, as immunostimulants, for reducing sperm motility, from which a contraceptive<br>
action is derived, as well as diagnostic agents.<br>
Prior Art<br>
It is known that the nucleoside adenosine is a modulator that is ubiquitous in mammals,<br>
including humans, and said modulator is bonded extremely tightly to the energy balance in the<br>
form of its di- and triphosphates. Adenosine itself has an effect on the nervous system, the<br>
cardiovascular system, the immune system, the respiratory system and the metabolism, whereby<br>
these actions are in general of a suppressive nature, i.e., the actions are sedative, vasodilative,<br>
slow the heart frequency and inhibit the diuresis as well as the lipolysis.<br>
To date, four different adenosine receptors have been identified that activate the adenylate<br>
cyclase via coupling to protein G and bear the names A1, A2A, A2B and A3. The central nervous<br>
system exhibits especially high densities of adenosine receptors, but in particular A1- and A2B-<br>
receptors are found in almost all tissue types. Because of their varied importance in medical<br>
physiology as well as pharmacology, adenosine receptors are in many cases subjects of detailed,<br>
scientific survey articles (see, e.g., K. N. Klotz, Naunyn Schmiedebergs Arch. Pharmacol, 362,<br><br>
382-91 (2000); P. G. Baraldi et al, Med. Res. Rev., 20, 103-28 (2000); C. E. Müller, Farmaco,<br>
56, 77-80 (2001), etc.). While receptor subtypes A1 and A2A are highly affine and are stimulated<br>
by adenosine already in nanomolar concentrations, subtypes A2B and A3 exhibit low<br>
(micromolar) affinity to natural ligands. On this basis, considerations of staggered activation of<br>
these receptors by increasing adenosine concentrations were advanced, whereby A1-receptors<br>
provide the basal activation in physiological dormant concentrations, and A3-receptors primarily<br>
exert their action for exceptional cases with greatly increased adenosine concentrations, for<br>
example for ischemic stroke or myocardial infarction.<br>
Adenosine A1-receptors are thus almost constantly activated according to this model<br>
presentation and exert a tonic inhibitory monitoring that can be eliminated by antagonists; this is,<br>
e.g., the pharmacological basis of the enlivening and dehydrating action of caffeine. Adenosine<br>
A1-antagonists are therefore extremely advantageous as pharmacological active ingredients in<br>
many respects:<br>
-	Within the scope of psychiatry for promoting the cognition for dementia conditions and<br>
as antidepressants;<br>
-	In the cardiovascular and urological areas as antihypertensive agents and antiarrythmic<br>
agents;<br>
- For the therapy of acute renal failure, in which adenosine A1-blocking eliminates the<br>
secondary vasoconstriction and can increase the blood supply. Here, the independent<br>
diuretic effect, especially the promoting of the potassium-saving natriuresis from A1-<br>
antagonists is of additional importance, since water retention results in a further increased<br>
stress on the circulatory system.<br>
- In the lungs, adenosine A1-antagonists can counteract a bronchoconstriction that is<br>
mediated via activation of A1-receptors by relaxation of the smooth tracheal muscles;<br>
there are therefore potential anti-asthmatic agents. Since these active ingredients promote<br>
the ejection of chloride ions from the epithelial cells there, moreover, a positive action on<br>
the clinical picture of the mucoviscidosis is discussed.<br><br>
In a remarkable manner, the activation of the A2A-receptors in the brain as well as in the<br>
retina of the eye has an antagonistic effect on the A1-receptors. A2A-antagonists, which are<br>
brought into connection with the modulating action of the adenosine on the release of various<br>
neuropeptides, metabotropic and ionotropic glutamate, dopamine and nicotine receptors, which<br>
in turn again influence the release of acetylcholine and dopamine, as well as with the release of<br>
gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) (J. A. Ribeiro, Eur. J. Pharmacol, 375, 101-113 (1999)),<br>
and represent potential therapeutic agents for the treatment of Parkinson's disease, can therefore<br>
potentiate the action of cerebral A1-agonists (F. Pedata et al., Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci., 939, 74-84<br>
(2001)). The latter represent potential active ingredients for the therapy of stroke patients and<br>
patients with retinal ischemia. Whether, however, adenosine A2A-agonists can eliminate the<br>
action of adenosine A1-inhibitors, however, is still not known at this time. Ligands with<br>
comparable bonding strength to A1- and A2A-receptors are considered undesirable, however,<br>
since the resulting pharmacological actions could be directed against one another.<br>
It is known that adenosine receptor antagonists with a purine or xanthine partial structure<br>
exhibit neither adequate affinity nor selectivity. These parameters could, hov/ever, be<br>
significantly improved, for example by using 2-furanyl derivatives of the triazoloquinazoline,<br>
triazolopyrimidine and triazolotriazine with the following structural formulas (E. Ongini et al,<br>
Naunyn Schmiedebergs Arch. Pharmacol, 359, 7-10 (1999) and Farmaco 56, 87-90 (2001):<br><br>
9-Chloro-2-(2-furanyl)-[1,2,4]triazolo[l,5-c]quinazoline-5-amine<br><br><br>
2-(2-Furanyl)-7-(2-phenylethyl)-7H-pyrazolo[4,3-e][1,2,4]triazolo[1,5-c]pyrimidine-5-amine<br><br>
4-[2-[[7-Amino-2(2-furanyl)[1,2,4]triazolo[1,5-a][1,3,5]triazin-5-yl]amino]ethyl]-phenol<br>
The cited examples, however, have different pharmacological or (physico)chemical<br>
drawbacks. The development of compound CGS-15943 as a therapeutic agent for ischemic<br>
stroke was thus halted because of inadequate selectivity. The compound Sch-52861, however,<br>
has a very high receptor affinity and good selectivity (KiA2A = 2.3 nm; KiAI = 121 nm), but the<br>
inadequate solubility and poor oral bioavailability limit the pharmaceutical suitability. The<br>
compound ZM-241385, which even has a selectivity factor of about 400, is used only as a<br>
tritated radioligand for visualization of A2A-receptors in the animal test.<br>
In addition to other triazolo[1,5-c]quinazolines and triazolo[1,5-c]pyrimidines,<br>
triazolo[4,3-a]quinoxalines were also examined. The fact that, on the one hand, 4-amino-6-<br>
benzylamino-1,2-dihydro-2-phenyl-1,2,4-triazolo[4,3-a]quinoxalin-1-one represents a selective<br>
A2A-antagonist (V. Colotta et al, Arch. Pharm. Pharm. Med. Chem., 332, 39-41 (1999), and, on<br>
the other hand, 8-chloro-4-(cyclohexylamino)-1-(trifluoromethyl)[1,2,4]triazolo[4,3-<br>
a]quinoxaline (CP-68,247) exerts a highly selective antagonistic action on the A1-receptor (IC50<br>
value is 28 nmol) (R. Sarges et al, J. Med. Chem., 33, 2240-2254 (1990)), clearly shows how<br>
closely these pharmacologically opposite actions lie to one another in this compound class. For<br>
all of these compounds, agonistic or partially agonistic action on the respective receptors is<br>
excluded, since such a one requires an intact nucleotide structure according to the present state of<br>
knowledge, but in any case an essentially intact ribose unit (C. E. Miiller and B. Stein, Curr.<br><br>
Pharm. Design, 2,501-530 (1996) and literature cited therein).<br>
Compounds with the following base are also known from the literature (B. Matuszczak et<br>
al, Arch. Pharm. Pharm. Med. Chem., 331, 163-169 (1998)).<br>
Also in this substance class, a dependence of the subtype-affinity on the substituent in 1-<br>
position was shown. While the 1-methyl derivative shows a higher affinity to the adenosine A2A-<br>
receptor than to the A1-receptor (A2A: Ki = 1.43 µm; A1: Ki = 7.85 µm, i.e., the selectivity factor<br>
is about 5), preference for the adenosine A1-receptor is provided in the case of the other<br>
derivatives (for R = 2-thienylmethyl: KiA1 — 200 nm). A comparison of the absolute values of<br>
the binding affinity to that of other adenosine receptor antagonists shows, however, that the<br>
compounds of this type are inferior in this connection and therefore in all probability are not<br>
suitable as pharmaceutical agents.<br>
Presentation of the Invention<br>
The object of this invention is to further increase the receptor activities of the initially<br>
mentioned pyrazolyl-substituted triazoloquinoxalines as well as their analogs in the form of<br>
tetrazoloquinoxalines.<br>
According to the invention, triazoloquinoxalines of general formula (I) with Y = CR, in<br>
particular 4-(chloropyrazolyl)-1-(3-phenylpropyl)-[1,2,4-]triazolo[4,3-a]quinoxaline as well as<br>
tetrazoloquinoxalines of general formula (2) with Y = N in<br><br><br>
are proposed, in which Rl to R4 are hydrogen, linear or branched, saturated or unsaturated alkyl<br>
radicals, cycloalkyl radicals, which optionally have one or more heteroatoms, aryl or heteroaryl<br>
radicals, alkoxy, hydroxy, halogen, amino, nitro, trihalomethyl, carboxy, alkoxycarbonyl or sulfo<br>
groups, whereby Rl to R4 are identical or different or can be present as fused aryl or heteroaryl<br>
radicals or as correspondingly hydrogenated or partially hydrogenated systems, and in which<br>
substituent R is hydrogen or a linear or branched-chain, saturated, and/or unsaturated carbon<br>
radical, a cycloalkyl radical, an aryl or heteroaryl radical in substituted or unsubstituted form,<br>
whereby substituent R is bonded to the base either directly or via an alkylene group, in which one<br>
or more carbon atoms can be replaced by heteroatoms, such as oxygen, sulfur or nitrogen, and in<br>
which substituent R5 is hydrogen, C1-C8 alkyl, allyl, arylalkyl, (hetero) arylalkyl or acyl, and in<br>
which radical R6 is a halogen or hydrogen, excluding compounds with Rl to R5 equal to<br>
hydrogen, R6 equal to chlorine and R equal to methyl, phenyl, benzyl, 2-furyl, 2-thienyl or 2-<br>
thienylmethyl.<br>
The first structure-activity relationships, which could be set up for this substance class,<br>
were in accordance with a pharmacophore model for A1 antagonists that was described in the<br>
literature (B. Matuszczak etal, Arch. Pharm. Pharm. Med. Chem., 331, 163-169 (1998)). These<br>
results suggested that the structure-activity relationships of standard A1-ligands are to be<br>
transferred to these tricyclic compounds. It should thus be possible, with the aid of known<br>
pharmacophore models, to develop compounds with improved receptor affinity as well as<br>
improved subtype selectivity.<br>
It was shown, surprisingly enough, however, that the receptor affinities were no longer to<br>
reconcile other derivatives with the pharmacophore models. The finding that unchanged receptor<br>
affinity was provided after removal of individual structural components, which up until this time<br>
had been considered as essential to the design of the interactions of the ligand with the receptor,<br>
shows that an analogy with respect to the binding to the receptor is not given and thus structure-<br>
affinity relationships also cannot be transferred from other substance classes to these compounds.<br>
Pharmacophore models that are known in the literature thus also cannot be used in these<br><br>
pyrazolyl-substituted tricyclic compounds; this compound class is rather to be considered as a<br>
completely new invention.<br>
Especially based on the pharmacophore and receptor model that is known in the<br>
literature, it was not to be expected that the compounds according to the invention show an<br>
affinity and selectivity to adenosine receptors, which makes them suitable to a large extent for<br>
use as pharmaceutical agents in terms of subtype-specific adenosine antagonists.<br>
Analogs that are considered within the scope of the invention are, in the same way<br>
starting from general formulas (1) and (2), those compounds in which in each case independently<br>
of one another, it holds true that substituents Rl to R4 are hydrogen, linear or branched, saturated<br>
or unsaturated alkyl radicals, such as, for example, methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, isobutyl, allyl, or<br>
cycloalkyl radicals, whereby optionally one or more carbon atoms can be replaced by nitrogen,<br>
oxygen or sulfur, aryl or heteroaryl, alkoxy, hydroxy, halogen, amino, nitro, trihalomethyl,<br>
carboxy, alkoxycarbonyl or sulfo groups, whereby substituents R1 to R4 can be identical or<br>
different.<br>
Substituent R can be hydrogen or an organic radical such as an alkyl, cycloalkyl, aryl or<br>
heteroaryl substituent, which is bonded to the base either directly or via an alkylene bridge, in<br>
which one or more carbon atoms can be replaced by heteroatoms, such as oxygen, sulfur or<br>
nitrogen.<br>
As an organic radical, a linear or branched-chain C1- to C6-alkyl group, for example<br>
methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, or isobutyl, is preferred. This alkyl chain can also be substituted in<br>
turn, for example, with halogen, alkoxy, hydroxyl, amino - unsubstituted or substituted with one<br>
or two alkyl, aryl or acyl radicals--, alkoxycarbonyl, carboxyl, sulfo or cyano. In addition, this<br>
substituent can also contain one or more double or triple bonds, as is the case, for example, in<br>
allyl groups.<br>
In addition, the organic radical can be a cycloalkyl substituent with the ring size that<br>
consists of three to eight carbon atoms. One or more carbon atoms in the ring can be replaced<br>
from heteroatoms, such as, for example, nitrogen, oxygen, or sulfur; moreover, the ring (for<br><br>
example, a piperazine, JV-methylpiperazine, morpholine, dioxolane, dioxane, adamantane or<br>
noradamantane radical) can also be further substituted.<br>
Further, an aryl or heteroaryl (for example furyl, thienyl, or pyridyl) radical is also<br>
preferred as an organic radical. The hetero(aryl) radical can optionally carry one or more<br>
substituents. As substituents of interest, in particular halogen, unsubstituted or else substituted<br>
alkyl - as an example of a substituted alkyl of interest, for example, trifluoromethyl, alkoxy,<br>
hydroxy, unsubstituted or substituted - for example also acylated - amino, alkxoycarbonyl,<br>
carboxyl, sulfo, nitro and cyano are used.<br>
Substituent R5 can be hydrogen, a linear or branched alkyl, allyl, (hetero)arylalkyl, or acyl<br>
group. This substituent is found on one of the nitrogen atoms of the pyrazole ring.<br>
Radical R6 can be either halogen, such as fluorine, chlorine, or bromine, or else<br>
hydrogen.<br>
In addition, the invention relates to a process for the production of compounds (1) and<br>
(2), as well as pharmaceutical agents that contain the latter, as is disclosed according to the<br>
claims.<br>
Methods for Implementing the Invention<br>
In reference to the prior art, some possible variations are explained in the following<br>
experimental portion. These examples are used only for illustration, without, however, thus<br>
limiting the invention to this scope.<br>
I. Process for the Production of Compounds According to Formula (t) While Varying<br>
Substitnents R and R1 to R4<br>
I.1 Symmetrically-Substituted Derivatives<br><br><br>
[Key:]<br>
Hydrazin = Hydrazine<br>
Acylierung = Acylation<br>
Cyclisierung = Cyclization<br>
X and X' are the same radical or different radicals of the above-cited definition with the<br>
limitation X' = halogen, whereby in general formula (I), X also has the meaning of R6.<br>
R, R1, R2, R3 and R4 can be defined according to the above-cited descriptions.<br>
The synthesis sequence that is shown allows not only access to compounds in which the<br>
carbocyclic portion of the quinoxaline is unsubstituted, but also makes possible the production of<br>
symmetrically substituted compounds of the following type:<br><br>
a)	R1 to R4 = identical substituents1;<br>
b)	R1 and R4 = identical substituents and R2 and R3 = H;<br><br>
c)	R2 and R3 = identical substituents and R1 and R4 = H;<br>
d)	R2 and R3 = identical substituents and R1 and R4 = identical substituents<br>
The necessary symmetrically-substituted ortho-phenylenediamines can be purchased, are<br>
described in the literature or are synthetically available analogously to the derivatives that are<br>
described in the literature. Nitration reactions and subsequent reduction reactions are of special<br>
importance in the production of the substituted phenylenediamines.<br>
The production of such symmetrically substituted compounds (with X = C1 and<br>
R1 = R4 = H and R2 = R3 = CH3) is to be explained based on the dimethyl derivatives. The<br>
substance class that is selected for this purpose or the cited examples are used, however, only for<br>
illustration, without the invention being limited to their scope.<br>
Below, synthesis examples are indicated for the production of the compounds that are<br>
shown in synthesis diagram 1:<br>

A solution that consists of 5.402 g (25.55 mmol) of 3,6-dichloropyridazine-4-carboxylic<br>
acid chloride in 60 ml of absolute dichloromethane is slowly added in drops to a suspension that<br>
consists of 10.440 g (76.65 mmol, 3 equivalents) of 4,5-dimethyl-o-phenylenediamine and 25.55<br>
mmol of base (for example, triethylamine, pyridine, Hiinig base, or the like) in 150 ml of<br>
absolute dichloromethane at 0°C under nitrogen atmosphere. Then, the reaction batch is stirred<br>
until the reaction of the acid chloride is completed at room temperature (about 16 hours; TLC<br>
(thin-layer chromatogram) monitoring: several drops of the reaction batch are mixed with dilute<br>
hydrochloric acid, the solution is neutralized with saturated sodium bicarbonate solution and<br>
extracted with ethyl acetate, mobile solvent: ethyl acetate). The crystals that are produced are<br>
filtered off by suction, washed with dichloromethane and dried in a desiccator until a constant<br>
weight is reached.<br>
The filtrate is extracted three times with 200 ml each of ice-cooled dilute sodium<br>
hydroxide solution, the aqueous phase is washed with dichloromethane and then acidified with<br>
concentrated hydrochloric acid while being cooled with ice. The resulting precipitate on<br>
diacylated product is filtered off by suction, the aqueous phase is washed twice with<br>
dichloromethane and then neutralized with saturated sodium bicarbonate solution. The neutral<br>
solution is exhaustively extracted with dichloromethane. The combined organic phases are<br>
washed with saturated sodium chloride solution, dried on sodium sulfate, filtered off and<br>
evaporated to the dry state.<br>
For further reaction, the product (light yellow crystals) of the composition C13H12CI2N4O<br>
(311.17) (yield: 90%) exhibits adequate purity.<br>

that consists of 2.000 g (6.44 mmol) of N-(2-amino-4,5-dimethylphenyl)-3,6-dichloropyridazine-<br>
4-carboxamide (C-1) in 50 ml of anhydrous solvent (for example N,N-dimethylformamide) under<br>
nitrogen atmosphere, and the reaction mixture is stirred until the reaction is completed at 100°C<br>

For working-up, the reaction solution, while being exposed to nitrogen gassing, is<br>
carefully added to dilute hydrochloric acid. The accumulating product that is crystalline in this<br>
case is isolated and washed with water as well as petroleum ether and then dried until a constant<br>

A suspension that consists of 2.601 g (9.47 mmol) of the corresponding quinoxalin-2-one<br>
derivative (D-1) is refluxed in a mixture that consists of 50 ml of phosphorus oxychloride and 5<br>
ml of pyridine until the reaction is completed (about 3 hours; TLC monitoring: several drops of<br>

A solution of 1.1 equivalents of the corresponding acylating agent - for example acetyl<br>
chloride - in absolute 1,4-dioxane (about 2 ml per mmol of acylating agent) is slowly added in<br>
drops to a suspension that consists of one equivalent of hydrazinoquinoxaline (F-l) and 1.2<br>
equivalents of base (for example, triethylamine, pyridine, and the like) in an absolute solvent (for<br>
example, 1,4-dioxane, THF, acetonitrile) (10 ml per mmol of hydrazino derivative F-l) at room<br>
temperature. After the addition is completed, the reaction batch is stirred at room temperature<br>
until the reaction is completed (about 12-18 hours; TLC monitoring: several drops of the<br>
reaction batch are mixed with water and extracted with ethyl acetate, mobile solvent: for<br>
example ethyl acetate). For working-up, the reaction solution is poured into water, and the<br>
resulting product is then isolated. A possibility of the isolation is the separation of the resulting<br>
precipitate and subsequent washing of the precipitate with water as well as petroleum ether. The<br><br>
isolation of the product by extraction with a suitable organic solvent represents an alternative; in<br>
this case, the solution of the acylated product is then washed with water and saturated sodium<br>
chloride solution as well as dried, and finally the organic solvent is removed by distillation.<br>
To purify the respective acylated derivative, the corresponding product that is dried until<br>
a constant weight is reached and that consists of a suitable solvent is recrystallized. If necessary,<br>
the crude product is dissolved in advance in a suitable solvent - for example, tetrahydrofuran,<br>

1.2	Unsymmetrically Substituted Derivatives<br>
Since the reaction of unsymmetrically substituted ortho-phenylenediamines with 3,6-<br>
dihalo-pyridazine-4-carboxylic acid chloride results in general in the formation of an isomer<br>
mixture, and a separation of the isomer compounds is usually associated with a high expenditure<br>
of time and materials, the previously-described process does not allow any especially effective<br>
access to unsymmetrically substituted triazoloquinoxaline derivatives. The alternative synthesis<br>
strategy that is described below makes it possible, however, to obtain isomer-pure products and<br>
thus represents a considerable improvement compared to the current procedure.<br>
This process according to the invention is distinguished in that primarily an iV-acylation<br>
of an ortho-nitroaniline derivative is performed and only in the subsequent step is the second<br>
amino group formed. The latter is carried out by reduction of the nitro group. The additional<br>
reaction steps each correspond to the production of symmetrically substituted derivatives:<br><br><br>
[Key:]<br>
Reduktion = Reduction<br>
Hydrazin = Hydrazine<br>
Acylierung = Acylation<br>
Cyclisierung = Cyclization<br>
X and X' are the same radical or a different radical of the above-cited definition with the<br>
limitation X' = halogen, whereby X has the meaning of R6.<br>
R1, R2, R3, and R4 can be defined according to the above-cited descriptions.<br>
The necessary substituted 2-nitroanilines can be purchased, are described in the literature<br>
or are synthetically available analogously to the derivatives that are described in the literature.<br>
Nitration reactions are of special importance here.<br>
In the example of the monomethoxy derivative, this synthesis strategy is described in<br>
more detail below, but the invention is not to be limited to the latter.<br>
Instead of ortho-nitroaniline derivatives, derivatives of substituted<br>
orthophenylenediamines can also be used, if one of the two nitrogen atoms carries a protective<br><br>
group, and thus it is ensured, on the one hand, that in the acylation only one isomer results, and,<br>
on the other hand, the protective group should be cleavable under extremely mild reaction<br>
conditions. Suitable protective groups are known from the literature; here, for example, N, O-<br>
acetals, N-benzyl, N-benzyloxycarbonyl, N-tert-butyl, N-[di-(p-methoxyphenyl)methyl]-, N-(2,4-<br>
dimethoxybenzyl)-, N-[9-phenylfluoren-9-yl]-, N-silyl derivatives or else imines can be used.<br>

5.00 g (32.86 mmol) of 4-methoxy-2-nitroaniline is dissolved in 60 ml of absolute<br>
dichloromethane and mixed with 3.99 g (39.43 mmol, 1.2 equivalents) of triethylamine. After<br>
nitrogen is introduced, 7.30 g (34.51 mmol, 1.05 equivalents) of a solution of 3,6-<br>
dichloropyridazine-4-carboxylic acid chloride is slowly added in drops in several ml of absolute<br>
dichloromethane while being cooled with ice and while being stirred constantly. The reaction<br>
batch is then brought to room temperature, and stirring is continued until the reaction is<br>
completed (about 12 hours; TLC monitoring; mobile solvent: dichloromethane/ethyl acetate =<br>
9/1). For working-up, the reaction mixture is diluted with 50 ml of dichloromethane, and the<br>
organic phase is washed several times with 100 ml each of dilute hydrochloric acid. A portion of<br>
the product accumulates in crystalline form (TLC-pure) in this case and can be filtered off by<br>
suction.<br>
The combined organic phases are washed with water and saturated sodium chloride<br>
solution, dried on anhydrous sodium sulfate, filtered off and evaporated to the dry state in a<br>
Rotavapor. The residue is then recrystallized from ethyl acetate.<br>

added to this solution under nitrogen atmosphere, after which the reaction batch is stirred until<br>
the reaction is completed at room temperature (about 18 hours; TLC monitoring; mobile solvent:<br>
dichloromethane/ethyl acetate = 30/1).<br>
For working-up of the reaction batch, the catalyst is filtered off, and the filtrate is<br>
evaporated to the dry state. The residue is mixed with water, and the product is isolated by<br>
exhaustive extraction with ethyl acetate. The collected organic phases are washed with water as<br>
well as saturated sodium chloride solution and dried on sodium sulfate. After the solvent is<br>
distilled off, 1.403 g (77%) of a yellow powder of the composition C12H10CI2N4O2 remains,<br>

nitrogen atmosphere with 0.266 g (6.66 mmol, 3 equivalents) of sodium hydride. The reaction<br>
mixture is stirred until the reaction is completed at 100°C (reaction time: about 15 minutes; for<br>
reaction monitoring, several drops of the reaction batch are mixed with dilute hydrochloric acid<br>
and extracted with ethyl acetate, TLC monitoring of the extract mobile solvent: ethyl acetate; the<br>
complete reaction can be detected in addition from the changing of the reaction solution's color<br>
from dark red to brown).<br>
For working-up, the reaction solution is carefully added under nitrogen atmosphere into<br>
75 ml of dilute hydrochloric acid, after which the resulting suspension is allowed to stand for<br>
several hours at 4°C. The crystalline precipitating product is filtered off by suction and washed<br>
with water as well as petroleum ether. The residue that is dried until a constant weight is reached<br>
is dissolved for purification in tetrahydrofuran, the solution is mixed with activated carbon, and<br>
the mixture is briefly refluxed, filtered off and evaporated to the dry state in a Rotavapor. This<br>

mixture is refluxed until the reaction is completed (reaction time: 2 hours, TLC monitoring:<br>

water and petroleum ether and then dried in a vacuum until a constant weight is reached. For<br>
purification, the crude product is dissolved in tetrahydrofuran, mixed with activated carbon, and<br>
this mixture is refluxed for several minutes. After the activated carbon is removed, the solvent is<br>
distilled off, the resulting light residue is then suspended in ether, the solid is isolated and<br>
washed with ether. The thus obtained product of composition C12H11ClN6O (290.71) exhibits<br>
adequate purity for the subsequent reaction. For analytical purposes, a recrystallization from<br>

The synthesis instructions correspond to the general operating instructions for the<br>
production of compounds of type G-l.<br>
The explanation by way of example is carried out on the following synthesis example:<br><br>
0.240 g (0.63 mmol) of hydrazinoquinoxaline F-2 is suspended in 30 ml of absolute 1,4-<br>
dioxane and mixed with 0.100 g (0.99 mmol, 1.2 equivalents) of triethylamine. Under protective<br>
gas atmosphere, a solution of 0.146 g (0.91 mmol, 1.1 equivalents) of 2-thienylacetyl chloride in<br>
5 ml of absolute 1,4-dioxane is slowly added in drops at room temperature. The reaction solution<br>
is then stirred until the reaction is completed at room temperature (about 14 hours; for reaction<br>
monitoring, several drops of the reaction batch are mixed with dilute hydrochloric acid and<br>
extracted with ethyl acetate, mobile solvent: ethyl acetate). For working-up, the reaction batch is<br>
added to 75 ml of water, and the mixture is mixed with several milliliters of dilute hydrochloric<br>
acid to improve the crystallization.<br>
After several hours of standing at about 4°C, the crystalline product is isolated and<br>
washed with water as well as petroleum ether. For purification, the dried substance is dissolved<br>
in tetrahydrofuran and mixed with activated carbon. This mixture is refluxed briefly, then it is<br><br>
filtered, and the solvent is removed by means of distillation. The product that is obtained in this<br>
way in 57% yield (yellowish-beige powder) of the composition C18H15ClN6O2S (414.88) exhibits<br>
an adequate purity for additional reaction.<br><br>
The synthesis corresponds to the operating instructions for cyclization of compounds of<br>
type G-1 and is explained in more detail in the following synthesis example.<br><br>
0.195 g (0.47 mmol) of acid hydrazide G-2A is refluxed in a mixture that consists of 5 ml<br>
of phosphorus oxychloride and about 15 ml of an inert solvent (e.g., 1,2-dichloroethane or<br>
acetonitrile) until the reaction is completed (about 2 hours; TLC monitoring: several drops of the<br>
reaction batch are mixed with water, the solution is neutralized with saturated sodium<br>
bicarbonate solution and extracted with ethyl acetate, mobile solvent: ethyl acetate).<br>
After cooling, the reaction mixture is carefully added to 100 ml of ice water, the resulting<br><br>
crystals are isolated, washed with water and petroleum ether and dried. The aqueous filtrate is<br>
extracted three times with 100 ml each of ethyl acetate, the organic phase is washed with dilute<br>
sodium hydroxide solution, water, as well as saturated sodium chloride solution, and it is dried<br>
on sodium sulfate. The residue that remains after the solvent is distilled off is dissolved for<br>
purification in tetrahydrofuran, mixed with activated carbon and heated to boiling for a short<br>
time. The filtrate that is obtained after the activated carbon is removed is evaporated to the dry<br>
state. The crude product that is obtained is purified by means of column chromatography<br>
(stationary phase: silica gel; mobile phase: ethyl acetate) as well as recrystallization from ethyl<br>
acetate.<br><br>
Depending on the substitution pattern, compounds can be further derivativized with<br>
substituents on the quinoxaline ring. These derivatizations comprise, for example, the processes<br>
that are known to one skilled in the art, such as acylation, alkylation, nitration, reduction,<br>
hydroxylation, ether cleavage, etc.<br>
Unsymmetrically substituted derivatives can, if this substituent or substituents has/have<br><br>
influence on the acylation position, also be produced, moreover, starting from substituted ortho-<br>
phenylenediamines. The latter is provided, for example, when electron-withdrawing substituents<br>
are present. Starting from 4-nitrophenylenediamine, this variant of the production of<br>
unsymmetrically substituted compounds (for example with X, X' = Cl and R2 = NO2, R1 = R3 =<br>
R4 = H) is to be illustrated below, without, however, thus limiting the invention to this scope.<br>
Additional reaction steps are performed as described above.<br><br><br>
[R2 = strong electron-withdrawing substituent, for example NO2]<br>
An analogous procedure can be used when substituents that have an opposite effect, i.e.,<br>
activation of the amino group, are present. Both variants are also successful when using<br>
multiply-substituted phenylenediamines.<br>
Depending on the substitution pattern, additional modifications can be performed later.<br>
Starting from the nitro group, in particular the reduction to the amino group is of special<br>
importance. This function can be further derivatized - e.g., acylated or alkylated; this function<br>
can also be modified via a diazonium salt.<br>
The previously mentioned synthesis system is explained in more detail based on the<br>
following synthesis examples:<br><br>
The solution of one equivalent of 3,6-dichloro-4-pyridazinecarboxylic acid chloride in<br>
absolute solvent is slowly added in drops to a mixture of equimolar amounts of 4-<br><br>
nitrophenylenediamine and base (for example, pyridine, triethylamine, Hünig base) in absolute<br>
solvent (e.g., tetrahydrofuran, dichloromethane, 1,4-dioxane, DMF, and the like) under nitrogen<br>
atmosphere and while being cooled with ice. The reaction batch is stirred at room temperature or<br>
elevated temperature, i.e., up to the boiling heat of the solvent that is used, until the reaction is<br>

IL1 Derivatives with Different Substituents in 1-Position<br>
Synthesis strategy that is described above and that can be performed analogously to the<br>
prior art can be used for the production of the compounds according to the invention with<br>
different substituents in 1-position (for R ≠ H). Depending on the substitution pattern, further<br>
derivatizations, such as the processes of oxidation, reduction, ether cleavage, acylation,<br>
alkylation, hydrolysis, etc., that are known to one skilled in the art can be performed. The<br><br>
production of the compounds according to the invention with different substituents in 1-position<br>
is explained based on the examples below, but it is not limited to these examples.<br>
Representatives that carry an alkyl, cycloalkyl, aryl or heteroaryl substituent are presented here,<br>
whereby this radical is connected directly or via a spacer to the tricyclic compound.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

in 1-Position:<br>
Derivatives in which substituent R (1-position) represents a hydrogen atom cannot be<br>
obtained according to the previously-described methods. The latter are reacted, for example, by<br>
reaction of the corresponding hydrazino compound with trimethyl orthoformate. Below, general<br>
operating instructions, which explain the formation of such derivatives, as well as three<br>
examples, are cited.<br><br>
General Operating Instructions:<br>
A suspension that consists of 2.0 mmol of the corresponding hydrazino compound in<br>
trimethyl orthoformate (about 10 ml per mmol) is refluxed until the reaction is completed (TLC<br>
monitoring: several drops of the reaction batch are mixed with water, the product is extracted<br>
with ethyl acetate, mobile solvent: ethyl acetate).<br>
After cooling to room temperature, the reaction product is isolated. This is carried out<br>
either by the crystallized product being filtered off by suction or by mixing the reaction batch<br>
with water and extraction with a suitable organic solvent (for example, dichloromethane). The<br>
isolated crude product is then purified by recrystallization from a suitable solvent, for example<br>
ethyl acetate, tetrahydrofuran, 1,4-dioxane, N, N-dimethylformamide or alcohols.<br>

The structural modifications that are described in Sections III and IV below can also be<br>
used in the N-isosteres of general formula (2) according to the invention.<br>
ITT. Process for the Production of Compounds of Types (1) and (2) While Varying Substituent<br>
R5:<br>
In addition, the invention relates to new parazolyl-substituted [1,2,4]triazolo[4,3-<br>
a]quinoxalines, or 1-aza-isosteres, which are characterized in that in the pyrazole ring, there is no<br>
longer a free NH function, but rather another substituent, preferably alkyl, allyl, (hetero)aralkyl or<br>
acyl, carries one of the two nitrogen atoms. The introduction of this substituent R5 is carried out<br>
preferably by subsequent derivatization, for example alkylation, of a compound of general<br>
formula (1), in which R5 is equal to hydrogen:<br><br>
Owing to the chemical nature of the pyrazole, the formation of the R5-position isomers<br>
can be expected, by which by selection of the suitable reaction conditions, one of the R5-position<br><br><br>
isomers should preferably be produced. Optionally-occurring product mixtures can be separated<br>
by purification processes that are known to one skilled in the art, such as fractionated<br>
crystallization or chromatographic separating processes into the isomer-pure R5-substitution<br>
products of general formula (I), as shown above.<br>
Based on some examples, this structural variation is shown, whereby the invention is not<br>
to be limited to this example, however; other operating methods that are described for alkylating<br>
reactions can also be used.<br>
General Operating Instructions for Alkylation of N-Unsubstitnted Derivatives of General<br>
Formula (I)<br>
2 equivalent bases (e.g., powdered potassium hydroxide, sodium, sodium hydride,<br>
potassium-tert-butanolate) are added to a solution of one equivalent of the corresponding N-<br>
unsubstituted derivative of general formula (I) in about 5 ml/mmol of an absolute solvent (for<br>
example, dimethyl sulfoxide, tetrahydrofuran, 1,4-dioxane, DMF) under nitrogen atmosphere,<br>
after which the mixture is stirred for one hour at room temperature. Then, 2 equivalents of the<br>
alkylating agent (preferably alkyl halide or mesylate) are added, after which the reaction mixture<br>
is stirred until the reaction is completed at room temperature (TLC monitoring: several drops of<br>
the reaction batch are mixed with dilute hydrochloric acid and extracted with ethyl acetate,<br>
mobile solvent: for example, dichloromethane/ethyl acetate = 19/1). For working-up, the<br>
reaction batch is added in dilute hydrochloric acid (about 100 ml/mmol). The precipitate that is<br>
produced is filtered off by suction and washed with water as well as petroleum ether or extracted<br>
by extraction with an organic solvent. The dried crude product is then pre-purified by treatment<br>
with activated carbon. A subsequent purification/separation of the positional isomers is carried<br>
out by chromatography, optionally also by fractionated crystallization.<br>
The structures of these derivatives can be determined unambiguously, for example by<br>
means of x-ray structural analysis.<br>

A derivatization on the nitrogen atom of the pyrazole ring can take place not only in the<br>
stage of the tri-or tetrazoloquinoxazoline derivative, but also in an earlier reaction stage. For the<br>
compounds in question, the latter can be performed starting from compounds of type (D), (E),<br>
(F) or (G). The subsequent synthesis diagram combines the different possibilities. A process for<br>
introducing an acyl group is described in the literature for (E) with R1 to R4 equal to hydrogen<br>
(B. Matuszczak et al., J. Heterocyclic Chem. 35: 113-115, 1998). Starting from compounds of<br>
type (D), it is preferred to incorporate the derivatization on a compound that has a lactam<br>
protective group on the nitrogen.<br><br><br>
[Key:]<br>
Einfuhrung von R5 = Introduction of R5<br>
The introduction of substituents R5, starting from E, is to be described in more detail<br>
below based on an example. The invention in question is not limited thereto., but can optionally<br>
also easily be transferred to other substituents by slight modification of the reaction conditions.<br>
By variation of the conditions, especially by solvent, base, alkylating agent, temperature and<br>
optionally catalyst, the ratio of the two N-isomers can be varied and thus in the individual case<br>
also be shifted in favor of the desired isomer.<br><br><br>

Alkylatinn of a 2-Choloro-1-[3(5)-choloro-1H-pyrazol-5(3)-yl]qninoxaline for the Production of<br>
Compounds of the (E-Alkyl) Type:<br>
2 equivalents of a base (for example, powdered potassium hydroxide, sodium, sodium<br>
hydride, potassium-tert-butanolate) and, if necessary, catalytic amounts of an inorganic iodide,<br>
are added to a solution or suspension of one equivalent of a chloroquinoxaline of type (E) in an<br>
inert solvent (for example THF, DMF, 1,4-dioxane, DMSO; in each case preferably absolute<br>
solvent) under nitrogen atmosphere. The mixture is stirred for 1 hour at room temperature.<br>
When a suspension is present, an ultrasound treatment can have an advantageous effect on the<br>
deprotonation and thus on the further course of the reaction. Then, 2 equivalents of the<br>
corresponding alkylating agent, such as alkyl halides or mesylates, are added, after which the<br>
reaction mixture is stirred until the reaction is completed (necessary reaction temperature: room<br>
temperature up to the boiling range of the solvent that is used; the course of the reaction is<br>
tracked by mean of TLC, a sample of the reaction batch is mixed with dilute hydrochloric acid<br>
for this purpose and extracted with ethyl acetate; mobile solvent: suitable solvent or mixture). If<br>
necessary, i.e., in the case of reaction that is incomplete or proceeds too slowly, more base and/or<br>
alkylating agent can be added later. For working-up, the reaction mixture is added to dilute<br>
hydrochloric acid, and the reaction product is isolated. This is carried out by separating the<br>
precipitate that is produced or by extraction with an organic solvent, after which it is then washed<br>
with water. The separation of the isomers as well as their purification is carried out by means of<br>
chromatography and/or recrystallization.<br>

reaction is completed, whereby optionally several ml of a high-boiling solvent, such as, for<br>
example, 1,4-dioxane, is added (reaction monitoring: a sample of the reaction batch is extracted<br><br>
with ethyl acetate and monitored with TLC, mobile solvent: suitable solvent or mixture). For<br>
working-up, the reaction mixture is added to ice water, and the reaction product is isolated by<br>
separation of the precipitate that is produced or by extraction with an organic solvent, and it is<br>

II)	Reaction of the Compounds of Type L with Acid Chlorides<br>
Starting from compounds of type L, substituted [1,2,4]triazolo[4,3-a]quinoxalines can be<br><br>
produced according to the methods already previously described, i.e., acylation and subsequent<br>
cyclization (see production of compounds of type G-l and type (1)).<br>
The production is carried out by reaction of the isomer-pure hydrazine of type L<br>
according to general operating instructions (see Section II.2) or by a single-pot process, i.e., the<br>
hydrazide is not isolated, but rather also converted directly into the tricyclic compound.<br>
Although this process is described only on this spot, it is also suitable for the production of<br>
pyrazolyl-unsubstituted derivatives. In this connection see, for example, the following:<br>
Synthesis of 4-[1(5)-Choploro-1-ethyl-1H-pyrazol-5(3)-yl]-1-(3-phenylpropyl)-[1,2,4]triazolo[4,3-<br>

The invention relates to additional pyrazolyl-substituted [1,2,4]triazolo[4,3-a]quinoxaline<br>
or tetrazolo derivatives, in which the chlorine atom that is bonded to the pyrazole ring is replaced<br>
by other halogens or by hydrogen. The dehalogenation can be carried out, for example,<br>
reductively, i.e., by reaction in hydrogen atmosphere or with a hydrogen deliverer such as<br>
ammonium formate in the presence of a suitable catalyst (for example, palladium on activated<br>
carbon (B. Matuszczak, K. Mereiter, 'Synthesis in the Series of Pyrazolyl-Suhstituted<br>
Quinoxalines,' Heterocycles, 45, 2449-2462 (1997)). This dehalogenation reaction is enhanced<br>
by reaction at elevated temperature: As solvents, primarily alcohols, tetrahydrofuran as well as<br>
1,4-dioxane are suitable.<br><br>
The compounds in their salts, in particular for pharmaceutical use, optionally can be<br>
converted into their physiologically compatible salts with an inorganic or organic acid. As an<br>
acid, for example, succinic acid, hydrogen bromide, acetic acid, fumaric acid, maleic acid,<br>
methanesulfonic acid, lactic acid, phosphoric acid, hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, tartaric acid<br>
or citric acid is considered for this purpose. Also, mixtures of the previously mentioned acids<br>
can be used.<br><br>
If an acid function is present in the molecule, this compound can also be converted into a<br>
physiologically compatible salt for pharmaceutical use. The counterions can have both an<br>
inorganic and an organic nature. In this case, ions consist of alkali metals, alkaline-earth metals,<br>
ammonium as well as ammonium derivatives, in which instead of hydrogen, one to four organic<br>
substituents, preferably alkyl radicals, are present.<br>
In addition, the compounds can also be present in the form of physiologically compatible<br>
solvates, especially hydrates.<br>
In the section below, several results of the biological testing of selected representatives<br>
are listed. The compound number corresponds to the number that is described in the synthetic<br>
portion.<br><br>
The data of the biological tests that are cited below results from radio ligand-binding<br>

Description of the Assays That are Used for Testing Substances<br>
Production of Tissue Preparations Made from Rat Brains<br>
For the preparations, deep-frozen rat brains of the Pel Freez Company (Rogers, Arkansas,<br>
USA) are used. The rat brains are thawed in 0.32 M saccharose solution, the cortex is cut off,<br>
and the striata are prepared outside.<br>
The cell decomposing of the cerebral cortex is carried out with a glass-Teflon<br>
homogenizer (stages 5-6, 10 seconds) in 0.32 M saccharose solution. The membranes are<br>
purified over various centrifuging steps. With centrifuging at 600 g, 4°C, for 10 minutes, a large<br>
amount of cell debris is separated via the P1 fraction, and the supernatant (P2 fraction) is further<br>
worked up: in the subsequent three centrifuging steps (35,000 g; 4°C; 60 minutes), a pellet is<br>
produced that is resuspended in 50 mmol of TRIS buffer, pH 7.4 with the Ultraturrax (stages 3-4,<br>
3 seconds); the respective supernatant is discarded. The striata are added to cold TRIS buffer,<br>
homogenized with the Ultraturrax in stages 3 to 4 (3 seconds) and then centrifuged at 35,000 g,<br>
4°C, for 20 minutes. The supernatant is discarded, and the pellet is resuspended in 50 mmol of<br>
TRIS buffer (50 mmol, pH 7.4). The washing process is repeated twice more. The membrane<br>
preparations are stored at -80°C and are held for several months. The cerebral cortex membrane<br>
preparation is used for A1-radioligand binding studies, and the striatum is used for A2A-<br>
radiologiand binding studies.<br>
Tell Culture-<br>
As cell cultures, for example, CHO cells, which express the human Ai-adenosine<br>
receptor, are used.<br><br>
The nutrient medium, trypsine and PBS (phosphate-buffered common salt solution) are<br>
heated in a water bath to 37°C. The medium is suctioned off from the flask that is approximately<br>
80% to 90% confluently covered with CHO cells. PBS buffer is added, and the latter is allowed<br>
to act for about 5 minutes. Then, the buffer is suctioned off, and the cells are covered with<br>
trypsine/EDTA solution. After about 5 minutes, the cells are detached from the bottom of the<br>
flask. The trypsine/EDTA solution is diluted with at least the same amount of medium. With<br>
this mixture, the flask bottoms are rinsed two to three times to detach cells that are still adhering.<br>
Then, the suspension is added to a centrifuge glass and centrifuged at 20°C for 5 minutes<br>
at 1,000 g. The supernatant is suctioned off, and the cell pellet is taken up in fresh medium. The<br>
cell suspension is dispersed uniformly into 20 to 25 cell culture flasks that are inscribed with 20<br>
to 25 and that are filled with medium. The flasks are lightly shaken to disperse the cells well and<br>
then incubated for 2 to 3 days in an incubator (37°C; 5% CO2).<br>
The following medium composition is used, for example, for CHO cells:<br>
DMEM F12 with the following additives:<br>
•	10% fetal calf serum<br>
•	1% penicillin/streptomycin (finished mixture with 10,000 U of penicillin and 10<br>
mg of streptomycin)<br>
•	2 mmol of L-glutamine (stock solution: 200 mmol in 0.85% NaCl solution)<br>
•	0.2 mg/ml of G418 (genticin sulfate)<br>
For CHO cells that express the A2A-adenosine receptor, the operating steps are performed<br>
analogously to the previously mentioned A1-adenosine receptor-CHO culture. 0.5 U/ml of<br>
adenosine deaminase is added to the medium.<br>
In addition, A28-adenosine receptor membranes are prepared, whereby, for example,<br>
finished prepared membranes of HEK cells, which express the human A2B-receptor in high<br><br>
density (about 4 pmol/mg of protein), were available commercially (Receptor Biology USA via<br>
Perkin Elmer Life Sciences, Cologne, Germany).<br>
For CHO cells, which express the A3-adenosine receptor, the operating steps are also<br>
performed analogously to the A1-adenosine receptor-CHO culture. The medium is used as<br>
described above.<br>
Membrane Preparation of Recombinant Human Receptors:<br>
Preparation of recombinant, human Ai-adenosine receptors expressed by CHO cells for<br>
Ai-adenosine receptor binding studies:<br>
2 to 3 ml of ice-cold TRIS buffer (pH 7.4; 50 mmol) is added to the small tissue culture<br>
dishes. The cells are scraped off from the plates with a rubber scraper and collected in a beaker.<br>
The plates are rinsed with another 1 to 2 ml of TRIS buffer (pH 7.4; 50 mmol) and added to a<br>
beaker. The cell suspension is dispersed onto centrifuge tubes, homogenized with the<br>
homogenizer at the highest level (3 to 4 seconds) and centrifuged at 4°C, 35,000 g, for 20<br>
minutes. The supernatant is discarded, and the pellet is resuspended in TRIS buffer (pH 7.4; 50<br>
mmol) with the glass-Teflon homogenizer at the highest level for 3 to 4 seconds. This<br>
suspension is centrifuged again (4°C; 35,000 g, 20 minutes). The washing process is repeated<br>
another time. The pellet that is obtained is resuspended with the least possible TRIS buffer (pH<br>
7.4; 50 mmol) and delivered in aliquots (0.25 ml and 0.5 ml).<br>
Preparation of recombinant human A2A-adenosine receptors expressed in CHO cells for<br>
A2A-adenosine receptor binding studies:<br>
2 to 3 ml of ice-cold TRIS buffer (pH 7.4; 50 mmol) is added to the tissue culture dishes.<br>
The cells are scraped off from the plates with a rubber scraper and collected in a beaker. The<br>
plates are rinsed with another 1 to 2 ml of TRIS buffer (pH 7.4; 50 mmol). The cell suspension<br><br>
is dispersed to the centrifuge tubes and centrifiiged at 4°C, 35,000 g, for 20 minutes. The<br>
supernatant is discarded, and the pellet is resuspended in TRIS buffer (pH 7.4; 50 mmol) with the<br>
homogenizer at the highest level for 3 to 4 seconds. This suspension is again centrifuged. The<br>
washing process is repeated still another time. The pellet that is obtained is resuspended with the<br>
least possible TRIS buffer (pH 7.4; 50 mmol) and delivered in aliquots (0.25 ml and 0.5 ml).<br>
Before the tissue is used in an assay, it must again be washed with TRIS buffer (pH 7.4;<br>
50 mmol) for 20 minutes at 4°C and 35,000 g. The unspecific binding can thus be reduced.<br>
Preparation of Recombinant Human A3-Adenosine Receptors Expressed in CHO Cells for A3-<br>
Adenosine Receptor Binding Studies<br>
2 to 3 ml of ice-cold TRIS buffer (pH 7.4; 50 mmol) is added to the tissue culture dishes.<br>
The cells are scraped off from the plates with a rubber scraper and collected in a beaker. The<br>
plates are rinsed with another 1 to 2 ml of TRIS buffer (pH 7.4; 50 mmol). The cell suspension<br>
is dispersed into centrifuge tubes and centrifuged at 4°C, 35,000 g, for 20 minutes. The<br>
supernatant is discarded, and the pellet is resuspended in TRIS buffer (pH 7.4; 50 mmol) with the<br>
homogenizer at the highest level for 3 to 4 seconds. This suspension is again centrifuged. The<br>
washing process is repeated another time. The pellet that is obtained is resuspended with the<br>
least possible TRIS buffer (pH 7.4; 50 mmol) and delivered in aliquots (0.25 ml and 0.5 ml).<br>

DMSO in the assay is 2.5% for A1- and A2A-adenosine receptor assays and 1-2% for A2B- and<br>
A3-assays. Dilution series of the test substances are produced from the stock solution. Five to<br>
eight different test concentrations, which comprise 3 orders of magnitude (e.g., 1 nm to 1000<br><br>

The membranes are thawed and the receptor-binding assays are carried out with<br>
[3 H]CPPA according to the instructions given below with consideration for the amounts and<br>
solutions listed above. The dilution in the assay is 1:100 (to reduce the DMSO content to 1 %,<br>
since a higher DMSO concentration has a disadvantageous effect). The incubation time is 30<br>
minutes at 23°C in an oscillating water bath. The glass filter is introduced into 0.5% PEI solution<br>
30 minutes before use.<br>

First, solutions of the test substances in DMSO are produced in the required<br>
concentrations. The curve consists of 7 to 8 measuring points (measured in each case as triplets),<br>
which extend over a concentration range of 6 to 7 powers often. After the addition of 50 mmol<br>
of TRIS buffer, 50 mmol, pH 7.4, to the radioligand [35S]GTPγS and the membrane preparation,<br>
which was mixed with adenosine deaminase, a final volume of 200 µl is achieved. The<br>
incubation is carried out for 45 minutes at 25°C in an oscillating water bath. Then, the reaction is<br>
first stopped with 2 ml of cold washing buffer (50 mmol of TRIS, 5 mmol of MgCl2 x 2 H2O, pH<br>
7.4), and the suspension is filtered with a GF/B filter with the aid of the harvester. The reagent<br>
glasses are rinsed twice with 2 ml each of column washing buffer. The filter plates are conveyed<br>
by means of a punched-out plate into the scintillation vial, which is filled with 2 ml of<br>
Scintillation cocktail. The vials are shaken well to wet the filter papers completely. After an<br>
incubation of at least 3 hours, the radioactivity in the LS counter is determined by a 2-minute<br>
measurement. The curves are reproduced three times in each case.<br>
In the assay, solutions of test substances 1:20 are diluted; the DMSO content in the assay<br>
is 5% (V/V).<br>
Evaluation of the Radioligand Rinding Studies:<br>
The mean value is calculated from three independent experiments. IC50 and K1 values are<br>
obtained from the Cheng-Prusoff equation, the concentration and the KD value of the radioligand.<br>
For calculation, the program GraphPadPrism™, Version 3.0 (GraphPad, San Diego, California,<br>
USA), was used.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
