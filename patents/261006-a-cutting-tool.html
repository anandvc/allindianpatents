				<td>The present invention relates to a cuting tool.<br>
This application claims foreign priority front Japanese Patent Application No.'2005-345635, filed on November 30, 2005, the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br><field of the invention><br>
The present invention relates to a cutting tool of a rotary<br>
type, and particularly relates to a cutting tool in which a<br>
cutting chip is detachably attached to a cutter main body.<br><related art><br>
In order to form a peripheral edge shape of a valve seat portion in an engine with high accuracy, a cutter main body mounted with a cutting chip having a shape corresponding to the peripheral edge shape is prepared and used. The cutter main body has a connection flange to be connected to a rotating means, and a supply path for oil supply, etc. in addition to the cutting chip.<br>
It is preferable to set the cutting chip to be exchangeable since the cutting chip is worn when it is.used.  JP-A-2003-136309' proposes a cutting tool directly fixed to the cutter main body by a fastening screw.  The fastening screw in this cutting <br>
tool is arranged in a direction perpendicular to an axial direction of the cutter main body.<br>
In the cutting tool of JP-A-2003-136309, an area for seating a head portion of the fastening screw and a washer on a side face of the cutting chip is surely required so that it is difficult to perform compactness. Further, in the cutter main body, it is also necessary to arrange a screw groove for screwing the fastening screw thereinto in a direction perpendicular to the axial direction so that it is also difficult to perform compactness. Accordingly, in such a cutting tool, it is difficult to process the valve seat portion of a thin diameter, etc. Therefore, when the valve seatportionof the thin diameter, etc. are processed, a dedicated cutting tool in which a cutting chip is fixed to a dedicated thin cutter main body by brazing is used.<br>
However, in the cutting tool, since the cutting chip is fixed by brazing, it is impossible to exchange the cutting chip even when the cutting chip is worn. Therefore, the cutting tool itself is disused together with the cutter main body, which is uneconomical.<br>
The present invention is made in consideration of such problems, and its object is to provide a cutting tool able to process a thin diameter hole with high accuracy, and freely exchanging the cutting chip.<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
In accordance with one or more embodiments of the present invention, a cutting tool is provided with: a cutter main body connected to a rotating means; a space arranged in the cutter main body, and having a first space side face of one circumferential direction and a second space side face of the other circumferential direction; a cutting chip arranged in the space; a pressing piece arranged in the space, and pressing and fixing the cutting chip; and a slider for moving the pressing piece in an axial direction. In the cutting tool, a first chip side face of one circumferential direction of the cutting chip abuts on the first space side face; a second chip side face of the other circumferential direction of the cutting chip abuts on the first piece side face of one circumferential direction of the pressing piece; a second piece side face of the other circumferential direction of the pressing piece abuts on the second space side face; the distance between the second chip side face and the second space side face is formed so as to be gradually reduced along the axial direction of the cutter main body; and the pressing piece is moved in the axial direction under the action of the slider so that the pressing piece presses and fixes the cutting chip to the first space side face by a wedge action.<br><br>
Thus, the distance between the second chip side face and the second space side face is formed so as to be gradually reduced along the axial direction, and the pressing piece is slid and moved therebetween and the cutting chip can be fixed by the wedge action. Further, the cutting chip is opened and is freely exchanged by moving the pressing piece in the reverse direction by the action of the slider.<br>
In a part for connecting the cutting chip to the cutter main body, no fastening screw is required and it is sufficient if there is an area suitable for the reception of force from the pressing piece. Therefore, compactness can be performed. Accordingly, it can be set to a size and a shape suitable for a thin diameter hole, and processing of high accuracy can be performed.<br>
Further, an adjust screw may be arranged to be freely advanced and retreated by screwing in the axial direction with respect to the cutter main body, and having an end portion abutting on the cutting chip and performing axial positioning. Thus, the cutting chip can adjust a projecting amount by the adjust screw.<br>
In accordance with the cutting tool of one or more embodiments of the present invention, the distance between the second chip side face and the second space side face is formed so as to be gradually reduced along the axial direction,<br><br>
and the pressing piece is slid and moved therebetween, and the cutting chip can be fixed by the wedge action. Further, the cutting chip is opened and is freely exchanged by moving the pressing piece in the reverse direction by the action of the slider. Accordingly, even when the cutting chip is worn, processing of disuse, etc. can be performed separately from the cutter main body so that it is economical and there is no uselessness of resources. Further, since the cutting chip can be separated from the cutter main body, polishing can be easily performed, and reutilization can be performed.<br>
Furthermore, in a part for connecting the cutting chip to the cutter main body, no fastening screw is required and it is sufficient if there is an area suitable for the reception of force from the pressing piece. Therefore, compactness can be performed. Accordingly, it can be set to a size and a shape suitable for a thin diameter hole, and process ing of high accuracy can be performed.<br>
Further, in the cutting tool the cutter main body may include: a reamer insertion hole to which a reamer is inserted; a first oil supply path having one end opened to a rear face of the cutter main body and the other end opened to the reamer insertion hole, and supplying oil to the reamer insertion hole; and a second oil supply path having one end opened to the reamer<br><br>
insertion hole and the other end opened to a vicinity of an edge of the cutting ship, and supplying oil to the vicinity of the edge.<br>
In accordance with one or more embodiments of the present invention, a cutting system may use the cutting tool, and the reamer is inserted in the reamer insertion hole.<br>
Further, in the cutting system, the cutting tool is positioned so as to be coaxial with respect to the reamer.<br>
In accordance with one or more embodiments of the present invention, a boring processing method using the cutting tool is provided with the steps of: opening the cutting chip by a means for moving the slider; adjusting a position of the cutting chip by a means for positioning the cutting chip; and fixing the cutting chip by the means for moving the slider.<br>
In accordance with one or more embodiments of the present invention, a boring processing method using the cutting tool is provided with the steps of: supplying oil by the oil supply path of the cutting tool, while the cutting tool processes the boring.<br>
In accordance with one or more embodiments of the present invention, a boring processing method using the cutting system is provided with the steps of: supplying oil by the oil supply path of the cutting tool, while the cutting tool or the reamer processes the boring.<br><br>
Further, the boring processing method may further be provided with the steps of: boring processing a valve seat of an engine by the cutting tool; and boring processing a valve guide hole of the engine by the reamer. In the method, the valve seat and the valve guide hole may be processed so that the valve seat and the valve guide hole are coaxially positioned.<br>
Other aspects and advantages of the invention will be apparent from the following description and the appended claims .<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS<br>
Next,  a cutting tool in accordance with exemplary embodiments of the present invention will be explained with<br><br>
reference to the accompanying Figs. 1 to 13. In the following explanation, the direction of arrow Al in Fig. 1 is called forward, and the direction of arrow A2 is called backward, and the circumferential direction of arrow Bl is called the clockwise direction (one circumferential direction), and the circumferential direction of arrow B2 is called the counterclockwise direction (the other circumferential direction) to specify directions.<br>
As shown in Figs. 1 and 2, a cutting tool 10 in accordance with an exemplary embodiment has a cutter main body 12, three cutting chips 14 arranged in the cutter main body 12, a pressing piece 16 for pressing and fixing each of the cutting chips 14, a clamp screw (slider) 18 for moving the pressing piece 16 in an axial direction, and an adjust screw 20 for positioning each cutting chip 14 in its axial direction. The cutting chips 14 are arranged in three positions at an interval of 120°. The pressing piece 16, the clamp screw 18 and the adjust screw 20 are arranged correspondingly to each of the cutting chips 14. The cutting chip 14 and the pressing piece 16 are arranged in a groove portion (space) 30 formed on a side face of the cutter main body 12.<br>
The cutting chip 14 approximately has an elongated shape of a square in section, and an edge 15 of a verge portion of the counterclockwise direction of a tip is polished in a shape<br><br>
suitable for cutting of a work.  The pressing piece 16 approximately has a trapezoidal shape in section, and has a first piece side face 16a of the clockwise direction, a second piece side face 16b of the counterclockwise direction, a lower face 16c facing a bottom face of the groove portion (space) 30, and a U-character groove 16d opened to the lower face 16c. The first piece side face 16a and the lower face 16c are planes, and the second piece side face 16b is a tapered face. Namely, the second piece side face 16b is slightly inclined so as to approach in the clockwise direct ion toward the backward direct ion in the axial direction.<br>
The clamp screw 18 has a stepped bar shape, and sequentially has a head 18a, a piece attaching portion 18b, a main member 18c and a screw portion 18d from the forward direction to the backward direction. A tool hole 18e is arranged on a rear end face of the clamp screw 18, and a tool such as a hexagon wrench (see Fig. 5), etc. can be inserted into the tool hole 18e.<br>
In the head 18a and the main member 18c, an axial contact face 110 abutting on the pressing piece 16 is set to a plane (see Figs. 4 and 5), and an engaging face 112 of the pressing piece 16 is set to a plane.<br>
The diameter of the piece attaching portion 18b is set to be narrower than the width of the U-character groove 16d<br><br>
of the pressing piece 16, and the length of the piece attaching portion 18b is slightly longer than that of the pressing piece 16. As described later, when the pressing piece 16 is moved under the operation of the clamp screw 18, the pressing piece 16 is moved along an extending direction of the clamp screw 18 and is also displaced in a direction perpendicular to this extending direction. Accordingly, the U-character groove 16d has a width having a margin for allowing this displacement<br>
(see Figs. 6 and 7) .<br>
The head 18a and the main member 18c have the same diameter, and are set to have a diameter slightly larger than the width of the U-character groove 16d. The piece attaching portion 18b of the clamp screw 18 is fitted into the U-character groove 16d by such a shape. When the clamp screw 18 is moved backward, a rear face of the head 18a is engaged with the pressing piece 16. When the clamp screw 18 is moved forward, &amp; front face of the main member 18c is engaged with the pressing piece 16.<br>
Thus, the pressing piece 16 can be moved forward or backward in the axial direction.<br>
The adjust screw 20 has an elongated shape, and has a forward push rod 20a and a backward screw portion 20b. A tool hole 20c is arranged on a rear end face of the adjust screw 20, and a tool T such as a hexagon wrench, etc. can be inserted into the tool hole 20c.<br><br>
The cutter main body 12 has a flange 22 of a large diameter, a positioning insertion portion 24 slightly projected backward in the axial direction from the flange 22, a chip attaching portion 26 projected forward in the axial direction and approximately having a columnar shape, and a tip portion 28 of a small diameter further projected from the chip attaching portion 26. The tip portion 28 has a stepped shape of two steps. This shape is set to two steps in manufacture of the cutter main body 12. However, the tip portion 28 is not necessarily set to two steps, but may be also set to three steps or more and no step may be also set.<br>
The flange 22 is a connecting portion with respect to an unillustrated rotating means such as a motor, etc., and has plural attaching holes 22a arranged at an egual interval. The positioning insertion portion 24 is inserted into one portion of the motor or a connection relay member so as to become accurately coaxial with respect to the motor. A forward portion of the chip attaching portion 26 is set to have a small diameter in accordance with the diameter of a valve seat 104 (see Fig. 8) described later. A backward portion of the chip attaching portion 26 is gradually diametrically enlarged backward, and is smoothly connected to the flange 22.<br>
The groove portion 30 attaching the cutting chip 14 thereto is arranged in three positions at an interval of 120° on a<br><br>
side face of the chip attaching portion 26. The groove portion<br>
30 is approximately arranged over the entire length of the<br>
chip attaching portion 26 in its axial direction. A forward<br>
portion of the groove portion 30 is opened to a forward end<br>
face 26a of the chip attaching portion 26. A backward portion<br>
of the groove portion 30 is extended until the vicinity of<br>
a forward end face 22b of the flange 22.  The depth of the<br>
groove portion 30 is slightly shallower than the height of<br>
the cutting chip 14. The cutting chip 14 is slightly projected<br>
in a diametrical direction from an outer face of the chip attaching<br>
portion 26.  It is sufficient to project the cutting chip 14<br>
at its tip in the axial direction from the forward end face<br>
26a of the chip attaching portion 26.  The cutting chip 14<br>
is not necessarily projected in the diametrical direction,<br>
and may be pulled-in in the diametrical direction.  Further,<br>
the depth of the groove portion 30 is deeper than that of the<br>
pressing piece 16, and no pressing piece 16 is projected from<br>
the chip attaching portion 26.  Further, the depth of the groove<br>
portion 30 is slightly deeper than a step difference width<br>
of the forward end face 26a. A bottom face 32 of the groove<br>
portion 30 is extended until a backward portion of the tip<br>
portion 28, and forms a plane.  A recess 33 for securing<br>
operability and visibility is arranged in the backward vicinity<br>
of the groove portion 30.<br><br>
A backward portion 30b of a length of about 2/3 of the entire length of the groove portion 30 has the same width as the cutting chip 14. A forward portion 30a of a length of the other about 1/3 is set to have a width able to arrange the cutting chip 14 and the pressing piece 16 in parallel. More particularly, a first groove side face 31a of the clockwise direction of the groove portion 30 is formed as a single plane extending in the axial direction over the approximately entire length, and comes in contact with one first chip side face 14a of the cutting chip 14. As shown in Fig. 3, a second groove side face 31b of the counterclockwise direction in the forward portion 30a of the groove portion 30 is formed in an overhang shape wide on a depth side in comparison with a surface side in conformity with the shape of the second piece side face 16b of the pressing piece 16. Thus, it is possible to prevent the pressing piece 16 from dropping off in an outer diametrical direction and the pressing piece 16 is stabilized even at an unmounting time of the cutting chip 14 by forming the second groove side face 31b in the overhang shape.<br>
Further, the second groove side face 31b is slightly inclined toward the axial direction. The distance between the second groove side face 31b and a second chip side face 14b is formed so as to be gradually reduced backward in the axial direction of the cutter main body 12 . Further, a portion<br><br>
between the second groove side face 31b and the second chip side face 14b forms a passage portion 34 for advancing and retreating the pressing piece 16 in the axial direction. An inclination angle of the second groove side face 31b is equal to the inclination angle of the second piece side face 16b of the above pressing piece 16.<br>
A third groove side face 31c of the counterclockwise direction in a backward portion 30b of the groove portion 30 is a face parallel with the first groove side face 31a, and can hold the cutting chip 14 so as to be freely advanced and retreated together with the first groove side face 31a.<br>
As shown in Fig. 4, the cutter main body 12 has a first screw hole 36 for inserting the clamp screw 18 thereinto, and a second screw hole 38 for inserting the adjust screw 20 thereinto . The first screw hole 36 is extended in the axial direction of the cutter main body 12, and a forward portion of the first screw hole 36 is opened to an end face 31d of a rear face side of the passage portion 34. A backward portion of the first screw hole 36 is opened and communicated with a rear face of the flange 22. A female screw screwed to the screw portion 18d of the clamp screw 18 is arranged in the first screw hole 36.<br>
The screw portion 18d is screwed to the female screw of the first screw hole 36. A tool T is inserted into the tool<br><br>
hole 18e from the backward direction of the first screw hole 36 and is rotated so that the clamp screw 18 can be moved in the axial direction. As this movement is made, the pressing piece 16 fitted to the piece attaching portion 18b is also moved in the axial direction in the passage portion 34.<br>
The second screw hole 38 is extended in the axial direction of the cutter main body 12. A forward portion of the second screw hole 38 is opened to a face 31e between the first groove side face 31a and the third groove side face 31c. A backward portion of the second screw hole 38 is opened and communicated with a rear face of the flange 22. A female screw screwed to the screw portion 20b is arranged in the second screw hole 38 . The push rod 20a of the adjust screw 20 is partially exposed to the groove portion 30, and a tip portion of the push rod 20a abuts on a backward end portion of the cutting chip 14.<br>
The screw portion 20b is screwed to the female screw of the second screw hole 38. The tool T is inserted into the tool hole 20c from the backward direction of the second screw hole 38 and is rotated so that the adjust screw 20 can be moved in the axial direction. As this movement is made, a projecting amount of the push rod 20a with respect to the groove portion 30 is changed. The cutting chip 14 can be positioned in the axial direction by pushing-out the cutting chip 14 . The cutting chip 14 is positioned in a moderate position correspondingly<br><br>
to a work. Concretely, the edge 15 is adjusted so as to be projected until an area of the bottom face 32 forward from the forward end face 26a of the chip attaching portion 26.<br>
As shown in Fig. 8, the cutter main body 12 has a reamer insertion hole 40 of a central portion, a first oil supply path 42 and a second oil supply path 44. One end of the first oil supply path 42 is opened to a rear face of the flange 22, and the other end is opened to the reamer insertion hole 40. One end of the second oil supply path 44 is opened to the vicinity (e.g., forward end face 26a) of the edge 15, and the other end is opened to the reamer insertion hole 40.<br>
A reamer 46 for cutting the inner face of a valve guide hole 102 of an engine 100 (see Fig. 8) is inserted into a tip portion of the reamer insertion hole 40 through a reamer bush, and the cutting tool 10 is accurately positioned so as to become coaxial with respect to the reamer 46. The reamer 46 is an edge tool for finishing the inner face of the valve guide hole 102, and is advanced along the reamer bush arranged within the cutter main body 12, and processes (bores) the inner face of the valve guide hole 102. Oil is supplied to the first oil supply path 42 through a predetermined pipe path. This oil is discharged toward the edge 15 through the reamer insertion hole 40 and the second oil supply path 44, and effects such as lubrication, cooling, etc. at a cutting time are obtained.<br><br>
Next, a procedure for performing cutting processing (boring processing) of the valve seat 104 of the engine 100 by the cutting tool 10 constructed in this way will be explained.<br>
First, the clamp screw 18 is rotated by the tool T in the counterclockwise direction (the clockwise direction seen from an operating side of the tool T) , and the pressing piece 16 is moved forward in advance. At this time, as shown in Fig. 6, the passage portion 34 is widened forward. Accordingly, the portion between the first piece side face 16a and the first groove side face 31a is widened, and the cutting chip 14 can be easily mounted. In Fig. 6, the inclination of the second groove side face 31b is shown as an inclination of an acute angle in comparison with the actual case to clarify that the passage portion 34 is widened forward. Similarly, in Figs. 7 and 9 to 11 described later, the inclination of one of side faces forming the passage portion 34 is also shown as an inclination of an acute angle in comparison with the actual case.<br>
Next, the cutting chip 14 is mounted to the groove portion 30. At this time, the cutting chip 14 is mounted such that the edge 15 is directed in the clockwise direction, and a backward portion is fitted between the first groove side face 31a and the third groove side face 31c. Further, the push rod 20a is projected by a suitable amount by rotating the adjust screw<br><br>
20 by the tool T, and the cutting chip 14 is positioned in the axial direction.<br>
Next, the clamp screw 18 is rotated by the tool T in the clockwise direction (the counterclockwise direction seen from the operating side of the tool T), and the pressing piece 16 is moved backward. At this time, as shown in Fig. 7, since the passage portion 34 is formed to be gradually reduced backward in the axial direction, the first piece side face 16a and the first groove side face 31a gradually approach and come in contact with each other. The tool T is further rotated in the clockwise direction. Thus, while the pressing piece 16 is moved backward, the cutting chip 14 can be pressed and fixed to the first groove side face 31a by a wedge action. Namely, the pressing piece 16 is moved along the extending direction of the clamp screw 18 under the action of the clamp screw 18, and is also displaced in a direction (clockwise direction) perpendicular to this extending direction. Thus, the pressing piece 16 presses against the second chip side face 14b of the cutting chip 14.<br>
Force directed backward is applied to the cutting chip 14 such that the cutting chip 14 is integrally moved by strong frictional force with respect to the pressingpiece 16. However, since a rear end portion of the cutting chip 14 abuts on the push rod 20a, its movement is limited and accurate positioning is performed.<br><br>
Such a mounting work is made with respect to each of three cutting chips 14. Thereafter, the cutting tool 10 is connected to a main shaft of a predetermined machine tool, and the reamer 46 is inserted into the reamer insertion hole 40.<br>
Thereafter, as shown in Fig. 8, the cutting tool 10 is advanced so as to face the valve seat 104, and the edge 15 of the cutting chip 14 abuts on the valve seat 104 and cutting processing is performed. After this processing, the tip of the reamer 46 is arranged to face the valve guide hole 102, and is advanced and the reamer 46 is accurately positioned so as to become coaxial with respect to the cutting tool 10.<br>
Finishing processing of the inner face of the valve guide hole 102 is then performed. The main shaft of the machine tool is then rotated and oil is supplied toward a cutting portion through the first oil supply path 42, the reamer insertion hole 40 and the second oil supply path 44. When the processing is terminated, the cutting tool 10 is retreated and the rotation of the main shaft and the oil supply are stopped.<br>
Further, when the fixation of the cutting chip 14 is released, the clamp screw 18 is rotated in the counterclockwise direction (the clockwise direction seen from the operating side of the tool T) by the tool T, and the pressing piece 16 is moved forward.<br>
Thus, the pressing piece 16 is pushed out forward, and the first piece side face 16a is separated from the second chip<br><br>
side face 14b, and the cutting chip 14 is opened. Thereafter, the cutting chip 14 is detached, or only the projecting amount can be readjusted by the operation of the adjust screw 20.<br>
As mentioned above, in accordance with the cutting tool 10 in the exemplary embodiment, the distance between the second groove side face 31b and the second chip side face 14b forming the passage portion 34 is formed so as to be gradually reduced along the backward direction in the axial direction. The pressing piece 16 is slid and moved therebetween, and the cutting chip 14 can be fixed by the wedge action. Further, the cutting chip 14 is opened and freely exchanged by moving the pressing piece 16 forward by the act ion of the clamp screw 18 . Accordingly, even when the cutting chip 14 is worn, processing such as disuse, etc. can be performed separately from the cutter main body 12 so that it is economical. Further, since the cutting chip 14 can be separated from the cutter main body 12, polishing can be easily performed and reutilization can be performed.<br>
Further, cutting chips 14 of various shapes can be mounted in accordance with the shape of a work so that general purpose property is improved.<br>
Furthermore, the projecting amount of the cutting chip<br>
14 can be adjusted by the operation of the adjust screw 20.<br>
Accordingly, the cut ting chip 14 can be appropriately positioned<br>
in accordance with the shape of the work and a wearing degree<br><br>
of the edge 15.<br>
Further, a fastening screw, etc. are not required in a part for connecting the cutting chip 14 to the cutter main body 12. If there is an area suitable for the reception of force from the pressing piece 16, it is sufficient so that compactness can be performed. Accordingly, even when the valve seat 104 has a thin diameter, the valve seat 104 can be set to an appropriate shape, and processing of high accuracy can be performed.<br>
A means for moving the pressing piece 16 and a means for positioning the cutting chip 14 are set to a screw system as in the clamp screw 18 and the adjust screw 20. Accordingly, it is mechanically simple and inexpensive and a fine adjustment of an advancing-retreating amount can be made in accordance with a screw pitch.<br>
The means for moving the pressing piece 16 and the means for positioning the cutting chip 14 are not limited to the screw system as in the clamp screw 18 and the adjust screw 20. For example, these means may use an actuator (slider) of compact cylinder, motor, etc. In this case, a sensor for detecting the positions of the pressing piece 16 and the cutting chip 14 is arranged, and these posit ions may be also automatically adjusted by feedback, etc. In this case, force for pressing the cutting chip 14 is proportionally generated in accordance<br><br>
with a moving amount of the pressing piece 16. Accordingly, the pressing force of the cutting chip 14 can be adjusted in accordance with the position of the press ing piece 16. Further, when the clamp screw 18 is moved, the pressing force of the cutting chip 14 may be prescribed by using a torque limiter (one of a mechanical system and an electric system may be used) , etc.<br>
The number of cutting chips 14 is not limited to three, but can be set to an arbitrary number of one or more in accordance with a design condition. When plural cutting chips 14 are arranged, it is not necessary to arrange these plural cutting chips 14 at an equal interval, but these plural cutting chips 14 can be set at arbitrary angles in relation to the work.<br>
Further, a space for arranging the cutting chip 14 and the pressing piece 16 is not limited to a groove shape as in the groove portion 30, but it is sufficient to form faces corresponding to the first groove side face 31a for pressing the cutting chip 14 and the second groove side face 31b for sliding the pressing piece 16. For example, a shape for covering one portion (or all portions) of an outer circumferential face may be also set.<br>
Next, cutting tools lOa, lOb and lOc in accordance with first to third modified examples of the exemplary embodiment will be explained with reference to Figs. 9 to 11. In the<br><br>
following description, a portion similar to the cutting tool 10 or the modified examples are designated by the same reference numerals, and their detailed explanations are omitted.<br>
As shown in Fig. 9, the cutting tool lOa in accordance with the first modified example is an example in which a first screw hole 136 and the clamp screw 18 are arranged in parallel with an inclination direction of the second groove side face 31b (i.e., slantingly in the clockwise direction). A pressing piece 116 corresponding to this cutting tool lOa is arranged in the piece attaching portion 18b of the clamp screw 18.<br>
The pressing piece 116 is a part corresponding to the above pressing piece 16. A first piece side face 116a of the clockwise direction of the pressing piece 116 is inclined so as to approach a U-character groove 116d (corresponding to the above U-character groove 16d) toward the backward direction. A first piece side face 116b of the counterclockwise direction is parallel to the U-character groove 116d.<br>
As shown in Fig. 10, the cutting tool lOb in accordance with the second modified example is an example in which a first groove side face 230a of the clockwise direction of a groove 230 (corresponding to the above groove portion 30) and a second groove side face 230b of the counterclockwise direction are parallel, and a second chip side face 214bof the counterclockwise direction of a mounted cutting chip 214 is inclined. Namely,<br><br>
the first groove side face 230a, the second groove side face 230b and a first chip side face 214a of the clockwise direction of the cutting chip 214 are respectively arranged in parallel with the axial direction. On the other hand, the second chip side face 214b is inclined backward in the counterclockwise direction.<br>
Further, in the pressing piece 216 corresponding to the above pressing piece 16, a first piece side face 216a of the clockwise direction is inclined in the same direction and the same angle as the second chip side face 214b, and a second piece side face 216b of the counterclockwise direction is parallel to the U-character groove 116d.<br>
As shown in Fig. 11, the cutting tool lOc in accordance with the third modified example is an example in which a second groove side face 330b of the counterclockwise direction of a groove portion 330 (corresponding to the above groove portion 30) is parallel to the axial direction, but a first groove side face 330a of the clockwise direction is inclined backward in the counterclockwise direction. A first chip side face 314a of the clockwise direction of a cutting chip 314 and a second chip side face 314b of the counterclockwise direction are parallel, and the first chip side face 314a abuts on the first groove side face 330a. Accordingly, as a result, the second chip side face 314b is slantingly arranged so as to<br><br>
approach the second groove side face 330b toward the backward direction. A pressing piece 316 has the same shape as the pressing piece 216.<br>
In accordance with such cutting tools lOa to lOc, a passage portion 34 gradually reduced in width toward the backward direction in the axial direction is formed by second groove side faces 31b, 230b, 330b of the counterclockwise direction of groove portions 30, 230, 330, and second chip side faces 14b, 214b, 314b of the counterclockwise direction of cutting chips 14, 214, 314. Accordingly, pressing pieces 116, 216, 316 are moved backward in the axial direction in the passage portion 34 under the action of the clamp screw 18 . Thus, cutting chips 14, 214, 314 can be pressed and fixed to first groove side faces 31a, 230a, 330a by the wedge action.<br>
When pressing pieces 116, 216, 316 are moved backward, pressing pieces 116, 216, 316 are moved along the extending direction of the clamp screw 18 and are not displaced in a directionperpendicular to this extending direction. Therefore, tolerance with respect to the diameter of the piece attaching portion 18b may be set to be small with respect to the widths of U-character grooves 116d, 216d and 316d. This is because a wedge action face is set to the second groove side face 31b in the above cutting tool 10, but a clamped material, i.e., the second chip side face 14b of the cutting chip 14 is set<br><br>
to the wedge action face in cutting tools lOa to lOc in accordance with the first to third modified examples. Further, as shown in Fig. 12, in head 18a and main member 18c of the clamp screw 18 in cutting tools lOa to lOc in accordance with the respective modified examples, an axial contact end face 400 abutting on pressing pieces 116, 216, 316 may be set to a spherical shape, and engaging faces of pressing pieces 116, 216, 316 may be also correspondingly set to a concave portion 402 of a spherical shape. Thus, pressing pieces 116, 216, 316 are engaged with clamp screw 218 without longitudinal and transversal backlash, and can be stably moved.<br>
Further, contact portions of head 18a, main member 18c and pressing pieces 116, 216, 316 are not limited to a spherical face, but may be respectively set to a shape reduced in diameter.<br>
For example, as shown in Fig. 13, similar effects are also obtained when axial contact end faces abutting on pressing pieces 116, 216, 316 of head 18a and main member 18c are set to a conical face 404 reduced in diameter, and engaging faces of pressing pieces 116, 216, 316 are correspondingly set to a conical concave portion 406 reduced in diameter.<br>
Further, in each of the above cutting chips 14, 214, 314, when its rear end face 14c is formed on a face perpendicular to the extending direction of the adjust screw 20 and the second screw hole 38, the tip of the adjust screw 20 comes in face<br><br>
contact with the rear end face 14c so that cutting chips 14, 214, 314 are stably positioned.<br>
Processing objects of cutting tools 10, lOa to lOc are not limited to valve seat 104, but can be also applied to processings of holes and concave portions of various shapes and diameters.<br>
The cutting tool in accordance with the present invention is not limited to the above embodiment modes, but various constructions can be adopted without departing from the gist of the present invention.<br>
It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications and variations can be made to the described prefer red embodiments of the present invention without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention.
