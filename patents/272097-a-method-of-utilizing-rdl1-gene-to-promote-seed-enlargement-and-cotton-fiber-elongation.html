				<td>A METHOD OF UTILIZING RDL1 GENE TO PROMOTE SEED ENLARGEMENT AND COTTON FIBER<br>
ELONGATION<br><br>
BACKGROUND OF INVENTION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The invention relates to plant bioengineering and plant gene improvement engineering. Especially, the invention relates to isolation of a specific cotton fiber gene RDL1 cDNA and construction of over-expression vectors, and methods for increasing the sizes of the seeds and the length of fibers of transgenic plant by RDL1 gene transfection.<br><br>
Background Art<br>
Seeds are important materials in agriculture and industries, relating to oil, cotton and food. The characteristics of seed directly determine the quality of seeds and products made from seeds. These characteristics mainly include seed size, seed weight, seed fiber length (for utility of seed fibers) and/or seed fiber strength.<br><br>
Cotton is an important crop in economy. Cotton fibers are important raw materials in the textile industry. In 2006, the cotton output in the world was 25,220,000 tons, among which China produced 6,730,000 tons. The textile industry increasingly demands higher quality cotton fibers. For example, the cotton fibers are desired to be longer, stronger, thinner and more homogeneous. Therefore, it is important to increase both the quality and quantity of cotton products. Developmental processes of cotton fibers are highly regulated. One of the main objectives of cotton breading research includes finding ways to increase the quality of cotton fibers.<br><br>
Cotton fibers are unicellular fibers differentiated and developed from ovule epidermal cell. The developmental process are divided into four stages: fiber dvelopment initiation, elongation, secondary wall biosynthesis, and maturation, in which the elongation stage and the secondary wall biosynthesis stage partially overlap. During these 4 stages, the morphology and structure changes of fiber cells changes are accompanied by important physiological and biochemical processes. During these processes, many genes participate in the regulation of fiber development.  Therefore, it is important to study the expression and regulation of these genes.<br><br>
It has been found that many cotton strains have genes that are highly homologous to Arabidopsis RD22, such as GhRDL1 (Grossypium hirsutum RD22-like). GhRDL1 is specifically and highly expressed during the fiber elongation stage. The gene encodes a protein having 335 amino acids. This protein is highly homologous with Arabidopsis RD22 protein. The C-terminal region of GhRDL1 protein contains a plant-specific BURP kringle domain. However, the function of BURP domain is not well studied.<br><br>
Therefore, there is a urgent need to develop methods that could effectively improve the characteristics of plant seeds, thereby enhancing the quality and quantity of the seeds of food, cotton and oil crops.<br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
After long-term in-depth study of the structure, function, and location of RDL1 gene, the inventors constructed transgenic vectors containing RDL1 gene. By using plant transgenic technology, the inventors obtained new plants with improved seed characteristics, such as transgenic cotton having increased seed weight and increased seed fiber length. The methods also produce transgenic Arabidopsis with increased seed sizes. <br>
The above observations indicate that RDL1 gene affects seed characteristics. The seeds, obtained from the transgenic plants expressing high levels of RDL1 gene, exhibit improvements, such as increased seed sizes, increased weights, increased fiber lengths, increased fiber strengths, and so on. Based on these, the inventors complete the present invention.<br><br>
For example, the inventors use the subcellular localization of RDL1-GFP fusion protein to show that GhRDL1 protein may be localized at certain areas of cell wall with polarized distributions. The results show that cell wall edges, marked by green fluorescence signals, are filled with the pectin-rich polysaccharide. In view of the main components of the primary cell wall also contain pectin during the rapid cotton fiber elongation stage, these data suggest that the specific localization of GhRDL1 may be linked to the pectin in cell wall. In addition, BURP and GFP fusion proteins exhibit similar localization characteristics.<br><br>
The inventors then use yeast two-hybrid methods to identify that GhEXPA1 protein (Gossypium  hirsutum  a-expansin   1)  is  a GhRDL1-interacting    protein. By  co-<br>
transfecting GFP-GhRDL1 and RFP-GhEXPA1 fusion proteins into Arabidopsis, followed by examining the root cells of Arabidopsis using confocal microscopy. The results confirm this protein-protein interaction by showing co-localization of fluorescent signals focused on the cell wall. Subsequent Co-IP experiments also confirm the interactions between these two proteins.<br><br>
To study the functions of GhRDL1, the inventors use agrobacteria-mediated methods to transfect 35S::GFP-GhRDLl into cotton. The results show the seed sizes of the transgenic cotton are significantly larger than the control. A hypocotyl from a 6d old cotton seedling of T3 generation was used to analyze mechanical characteristics of tissues before and after gene transfer. The results show the average force needed for breaking the hypocotyl is significantly greater in transgenic plants than that in the control. The statistical results obtained from T3-generation plants growing in the fields show average flower buds of most transgenic plants are heavier than the control. In addition, transgenic plants have increased weights (100 seeds) and increased fiber lengths as compared with the control. The above results show that over-expression of GFP-GhRDL1 fusion protein in cotton may improve the development of cotton fibers and ovules, and thus, it is valuable for cotton improvement.<br><br>

synthesis.    With regard to using PCR amplification to obtain related sequences, the<br>
appropriate primers may be designed based on the sequences disclosed in the present<br>
invention, especially the open reading frame sequences, and the templates may be a<br>
i commercial cDNA library or a cDNA library prepared using conventional methods known to one skilled in the art. When the sequences are long, two or more PCR amplification reactions may be performed, followed by ligation of these amplified fragments in proper order.<br><br>

These genes are also considered within the scope of the present invention. The tools and methods for sequence identity or homology comparison are well known in the art, such as BLAST.<br><br>
In this description, the term "RDL1 protein" refers to a polypeptide encoded by the RDL1 gene. This definition includes mutant polypeptides that can also improve seed characteristics. The proteins of the invention may be purified from natural sources, or obtained from chemical synthesis, or obtained from prokaryotic or eukaryotic host cells (such as bacteria, yeasts, plants, insects, or mammals) using recombinant DNA techniques. The proteins of the invention may be encoded by genes selected from cotton RDL1 gene or other homologous genes or gene families. The protein sequences of RDL1 may be selected from (a) SEQ ID NO: 2, SEQ ID NO: 4, or SEQ ID NO: 6; or (b) protein sequences derived from the amino acid sequences specified in (a) with substitution, deletion, or insertion of one or more amino acids, which have activities for improving seed characteristics.<br><br>

In addition, the expression vectors may preferably contain one or more selection marker genes to permit selection of the transformed host cell phenotype, such as dihyrofolate reductase used in culturing eukaryotic cells, neomycin resistance, and green fluorescence protein (GFP), or tetracycline- or ampicillin-resistance used in E. coli.<br>
The vectors contain the said DNA sequences and a suitable promoter or control elements may be used to selectively transform host cells to express proteins. Host cells may be prokaryotes, such as bacterial cells; or lower eukaryotic cells, such as yeast cells; or higher eukaryotic cells, such as plant cells. Representative examples include E. coli, streptomyces, agrobacteria; fungal cells, such as yeasts, plant cells, etc. The preferred host cells for use in the embodiments of the present invention may be agrobacteria.<br>
In the case that the polynucleotides expressed in the higher eukaryotic cells, enhancer sequences may be inserted into the vector to increase transcription. Enhancer is a cw-acting DNA element, which usually have 10-300 base pairs acting on the promoters to enhance gene transcription. One skilled in the art would know how to select suitable vectors, promoters, enhancers, and host cells.<br><br>
In this description, the terms "transgenic plants," "transfectants," and "transfectant plants" are used interchangeably, referring to cells, organs, or plants, which contain RDL1 genes and stably express RDL1 proteins, obtained by using conventional gene transfer techniques.<br><br>
Transgenic plants may be obtained by using agrobacteria transfection or gene gun bombardment methods, such as, leaf disc method. The transgenic plants, tissues, or organs may be re-cultivated (re-grown) using conventional methods to obtain plants having high disease resistance. The transfectants may be cultivated using conventional methods to express polypeptides in accordance with the embodiments of the present invention. Depending on the host cells used, various culture media selected from the conventional media may be used to incubate the cells under the conditions suitable for growth. When the growth of host cells reaches appropriate cell density, the promoters can be selectively activated by suitable methods (for example, temperature changes or chemical induction), followed by incubating cells for a period of time.<br>
The above recombinant polypeptides may be expressed within the cells, or on the cell membrane, or secreted out of the cells. If necessary, based on the physical, chemical, and other specific features, the recombinant proteins may be isolated and purified using different separation methods. These separation methods are well known to one skilled in the art. These methods may include, but not limited to,: conventional renaturation treatment, protein precipitation treatment (salting-out), centrifugation, osmotic lysis of bacteria, super process, ultracentrifugation, molecular sieve chromatography (gel filtration), adsorption chromatography, ion-exchange chromatography, high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), other liquid chromatography, and the combination thereof.<br><br>
