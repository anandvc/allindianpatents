The invention relates to a mounting eye in particular for a vibration damper.<br>
Such an eye is known from U.S. - 3,343,833. Unfortunately a plastics mounting eye such as disclosed in the cited state of the art is incapable of use. The required force handling capacity is not achieved. This is to be seen also as the reason why, in particular in its use on a vibration damper, plastics mounting eyes have not been generally adopted.<br>
It is the aim of the present invention to achieve a plastics mounting eye in which the required minimum retaining forces are achieved.<br>
By the introduction of the reinforcing strip the plastics body is additionally reinforced in the neighbourhood of the transverse opening. Only minimal additional costs arise, and these bear no relation to the effect achieved. Moreover it is an advantage that the mounting eye does not have to be increased in size by the introduction of the reinforcing strip.<br>
In a further advantageous embodiment it is provided that the reinforcing strip has a cylindrically formed guide extension joined by radially inwardly extending retaining tongues. The injection mould is simplified as the reinforcing sleeve and the reinforcing strip are orientated with respect to one another. Slipping apart of the two components is achieved by retaining tongues. Altogether the reinforcing sleeve and<br><br>
the reinforcing strip form a reinforcing unit for the entire mounting eye. According to the size of the mounting eye a second guide extension can be formed on the reinforcing strip concentric with the reinforcing sleeve and extending from the retaining tongues. The orientation of position between the two reinforcing components is improved by this measure.<br>
In accordance with an advantageous feature the second guide extension has a profile matched to the external profile of the reinforcing sleeve. Sharp-edged transitions between the reinforcing strip and the plastics body which would shorten the working life of the mounting eye are avoided.<br>
To increase the contact areas within the mechanical interengagement between the reinforcing sleeve and the reinforcing strip the retaining tongues have a recess of which the geometry is matched to the external profile to the reinforcing sleeve.<br>
To avoid relative movements between the reinforcing sleeve and the mounting eye the reinforcing sleeve forms a mechanical interengagement with the plastics body at least over a region of its external peripheral surface which departs from a uniform round shape. Thus it is provided that the departing region is in the form of a polygen.<br>
For locating the mounting eye axially the departing region is formed by at least one circumferential collar. It has been found particularly advantageous if a circumferential collar is mounted on each end of the reinforcing sleeve respectively. The quality of the guiding of the reinforcing sleeve is particularly good in this variant.<br><br>
Furthermore it is arranged in an advantageous manner that the reinforcing sleeve has a base or floor on that end of it which faces towards the transverse opening. The base or floor simplifies the outlay on sealing within the injection moulding tool so that no material can penetrate into the terminating opening.<br>
So that the mounting eye attains a minimum strength one can make the plastics body of particularly large form with regard to wall thicknesses. It has however been found that it is much more advantageous for at least one stiffening rib to be formed on the plastics body at least in the outer region of the transverse opening. This stiffening rib increases the strength very much more as the fibre materials of the plastics are more favourably directed than by merely adding on material in the case of walls of particularly large thickness.<br>
It has been found advantageous for the height of the stiffening rib to be at the most equal to the thickness of the material in the remainder of the region of the transverse opening and additionally where more than one stiffening rib is present they should each be formed at the edge or rim of the plastics body.<br>
By arranging that the plastics body has a covering surface with an annular wall for attachment to a protective tube, the mounting eye is particularly suited to vibration dampers and gas springs of which the piston rods must be protected against contamination and dust. The possibility is offered that the covering surface should be additionally connected to the remainder of the plastics body through stiffening ribs.<br><br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a mounting eye, in particular for a vibration damper, comprising a plastics body with a transverse opening for attachment means, a terminating opening for connecting to the assembly which is to be mounted, the terminating opening having a metallic reinforcing sleeve for reinforcing the connection, the sleeve forming a mechanical interengagement with the plastics body by means of a region of its external peripheral surface departing from the uniform round shape, characterised in that a reinforcing strip is inserted in the plastics body concentric with the transverse opening and that the reinforcing sleeve engages in the region of the mechanical interengagement.<br>
The invention will be further explained in conjunction with the following description of the drawings.<br>
Fig. 1 shows a mounting eye on a vibration damper. Figs. 2 and 3 show embodiments of the mounting eye.<br>
Figure 1 shows a vibration damper 1, illustration of the internal structure being omitted. It will be understood that the invention is not restricted exclusively to dampers. Arranged within the damper is a piston rod 3, the end of which lies outside a cylinder 5 and carries an attachment eye 7. The piston rod 3 has a screw thread for securing the mounting eye. A universally deformable rubber ring 11 is inserted in a transverse opening 9 in the eye and has a bush 13 pressed into it. A protective tube 15 encloses the piston rod and prevents the access of dirt.<br><br>
Figure 2 shows the mounting eye 7 as a separate component. The eye comprises substantially a body 17 of plastics with the transverse opening 9 for attachment means. Formed in an axial direction is a terminating opening 19 in which there is arranged a reinforcing sleeve 21. In this arrangement the reinforcing sleeve has a region of its external surface 23 which departs from a uniform round profile and forms a mechanical connection with the plastics body. For example it could be arranged that the reinforcing sleeve is made from a polygonal section which can be provided in a standard shape. Rotational relative movement between the plastics body and the reinforcing sleeve is thereby prevented. A circumferentially extending collar 25 opposes any linear relative movement. Within the sleeve there is formed a screw thread 27 matching the thread on the piston rod. In its mounted state the reinforcing sleeve bears against a shoulder 29 (Fig. 1) on the piston rod.<br>
The plastics body has a covering surface 31 with an annular wall 33 for the protective tube. The protective tube engages against the covering surface and against a face 35 on the annular wall.<br>
In the manufacture of the mounting the eye the reinforcing sleeve is inserted in an injection mould with the screw thread sealed off The injected plastics material encloses the surrounding collar and the external surface of the sleeve, resulting in an irremovable connection, secure against relative rotation and transmitting in a reliable manner the retaining forces which are required.<br>
Figure 3 shows a modification of Fig. 2 and so only differences are discussed. A significant departure lies in the fact that the reinforcing sleeve 21 has a respective<br><br>
circumferential collar 25 at each end, the collar nearest the opening 9 being formed by a base 37 on the sleeve. The sleeve has an undercut 39 for the screw thread 27, simplifying the formation of the thread.<br>
Furthermore stiffening ribs 41 are provided between the covering surface 31 and the remainder of the plastics body 7. Also the polygonal outline of the external surface 23 of the reinforcing sleeve 21 as already described with reference to Fig. 2 can be seen in the plan view.<br>
Figs. 4 and 5 show a modification of Figs. 2 and 3. As a further measure for increasing the strength, the plastics body 17 of the mounting eye 7 has a reinforcing strip 43 engaging behind the reinforcing sleeve 21 in the region of the mechanical interengagement. The reinforcing strip is arranged concentric with the transverse opening 9 and has a guide projection 45 to which there are connected radially inwardly extending retaining tongues 47. Formed concentrically with the reinforcing sleeve there is a second guide projection 49 extending from the retaining tongues. The retaining tongues ensure the axial interconnection between the reinforcing sleeve 21 and the reinforcing strip 43, whereas the guide extensions achieve the orientation in position between these two components. Furthermore, the reinforcing components can form a pre-assembled unit before insertion in the injection mould. In Fig. 5 the second guide extension is omitted in order to illustrate that the use of a reinforcing strip 43 is possible with correspondingly short reinforcing sleeves.<br>
To increase the contact area between the reinforcing sleeve and the reinforcing strip the second guide projection matches the external profile of the sleeve. From the view<br><br>
of the mounting eye from below it can be seen that the second guide projection 49 engages directly against the reinforcing sleeve. For this purpose the retaining tongues 47 are provided with recesses of which the geometry matches the external profiles of the reinforcing sleeve.<br>
As an alternative to the reinforcing strip there is the possibility of providing the profile of the plastics body with at least one stiffening rib 51 in the outer region of the transverse opening (see Fig. 6). The cross-sections illustrated are to the same scale as one another. It has been found that with several ribs and a minimum use of material a higher strength of the mounting eye can be achieved. The origin of this is not to be found in the resistance to bending - which can in fact even be smaller - but in the improved distribution of the fibres in the thinner wall thickness of the plastics body. It will be understood that the embodiments of Fig. 4 or 5 could also be combined with stiffening ribs in accordance with Fig 6.<br><br><br>
