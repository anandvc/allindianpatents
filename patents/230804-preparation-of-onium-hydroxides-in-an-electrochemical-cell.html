				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>This invention relates to a process for preparing an onium hydroxide from a onium slat in an electrochemical cell and to a method of purifying onium hydroxides. More particularly, the invention relates to the method of preparing and purifying onium hydroxides such as quaternary ammonium hydroxides, quaternary phosphonium hydroxides, and tertiary sulfonium hydroxides from the respective onium salts (or the hydroxide) in an electrochemical cell containing a bipolar membrane.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Quaternary ammonium hydroxides such as tetramethylarnmonium hydroxide (TMAH) and tetraethylammonium hydroxide (TEAH) are strong organic bases that have been known for many years. Such quaternary ammonium hydroxides have found a variety of uses including use as a titrant for acids in organic solvents and as a supporting electrolyte in polarography. Aqueous solutions of quaternary ammonium hydroxides, particularly TMAH solutions, have been used extensively as a developer for photoresists in printed circuit board and microelectronic chip fabrication. Use of quaternary ammonium hydroxides in the electronics area requires that there be no residue following the normal post-bake period. In electronic applications, it is desirable that the aqueous solutions of quaternary ammonium hydroxides should be essentially free from metal ions such as sodium and potassium, and halides such as chloride, bromide, iodide, etc.<br>
Particularly in recent years, there has been an increasing demand for quaternary ammonium hydroxides having a high purity.<br>
Quaternary ammonium hydroxides such as TMAH and TEAH have been produced by various techniques. Generally, the quaternary ammonium hydroxides are manufactured by electrolyzing a salt of a quaternary ammonium compound in an electrochemical cell containing one or more cation-exchange membranes. The quaternary ammonium salts used in such preparations include halide salts, carboxylate salts, carbonate salts and sulfate salts.<br>
Electrochemical cells use electrical current as a means to cause the movement of ions in solution. Among the prior art patents which describe the preparation of quaternary ammonium hydroxides by electrolyz-ing a salt of a quaternary ammonium compound are U.S. Patents 4,578,161 (Buonomo et al); 4,394,226 (Wade et al); 3,523,068 (Eisenhauer et al); and 3,402,115 (Campbell et al). Electrodialysis processes are well known in the art and are typically carried out in a stack arrangement comprising a plurality of flat sheet membranes. A stack consists of electrodes (anode and cathode) at either end and a series of membranes and gaskets which are open in the middle to form a multiplicity of compartments separated by the membranes. Usually, a separate solution is supplied to the compartments containing the electrodes, and special membranes may be placed next to the electrode containing compartments in order to prevent mixing of the process streams with the electrode streams. The stack between the electrode compartments comprises an assembly of repeating series of units of different membranes with solution compartments between adjacent membranes. This repeating unit is called a unit cell. Each unit cell is arranged to provide a plurality of parallel flow paths or channels therebetween. Solution is typically supplied to the compartments by internal manifolds formed as a part of the gaskets or by a combination of internal and external manifolds.<br>
The stacks can include more than one type of unit cell, and streams may be fed from one stack to another in order to optimize process efficiency.<br>
Treatment of aqueous salt streams by electrodialysis to form acid and/or base from the salt is known. The aqueous salt stream is fed to an electrodialytic water-splitting apparatus which comprises an electrodialyÂ¬sis stack and a means for electrodiatically splitting water. A useful means to split water to H+ and OH- is a bipolar membrane. Bipolar membranes are comprised of an anion-selective layer and a cation-selective layer of ion exchange material. In order for the membrane to function as a water splitter, the layers must be arranged so that the anion layer in each membrane is closer to the anode than the cation layer. A direct current passed through the membrane in this configuration will cause water splitting with hydroxyl ions being produced on the anode side and a corresponding number of protons being produced on the cathode side of the membrane. The disassociated salt cations pass through cation selective membranes and move toward the cathode, and the disassociated salt anions pass through the anion selective membrane and move toward the anode.<br>
Electrodialytic water splitting in a two-compartment cell has been disclosed in, for example, U.S. Patent 4,391,680 relating to the generation of strongly acidified sodium chloride and aqueous sodium hydroxide from aqueous sodiumchloride. Three compartment electrodialytic water splitters are disclosed to be comprised of alternating bipolar, anion and cation exchange membranes in, for example, U.S. Patent 4,740,281.<br>
U.S. Patent 5,397,445 describes various electrodialytic configurations employing bipolar, anionic and cationic membranes for producing an acid and/or an alkali metal hydroxide from a neutral salt. U.S. Patent 5,198,086 also describes various configurations or electrodialytically converting salt, the salt of a strong base and a weak acid to a base with improved purity.<br>

The conversion process and the purification of onium hydroxÂ¬ides in accordance with this invention may be by electrolysis in an electroÂ¬lytic cell or by electrodialysis in an electrodialytic cell. The electrochemical cells generally comprise an anode, a cathode, and one or more unit cells assembled for operational positioning between the anode and the cathode. A number of electrolytic and electrodialytic cells containing various unit cells and multiple unit cells are described herein which are useful in the process of the present invention. The unit cells may comprise four or more compartments defined by the anode, cathode, one or more bipolar memÂ¬branes and one or more dividers or separators which may be (1) nonionic microporous diffusion barriers such as screens, filters, diaphragms, etc., of controlled pore size or pore size distribution allowing certain ions to pass through the divider or separator, or (2) ionic dividers or separators such as anion selective membranes and cation selective membranes which are preferred since their use generally results in the production of onium hydroxides of higher purity and in higher yield. The various dividers useful in the electrochemical cells used in the invention are described more fully below. Several electrolyte cells useful in the present invention are described below. In the following embodiments which generally describe the conversion of onium salts to onium hydroxide, the purification of onium hydroxides of the process of the invention can be illustrated by replacing the onium salt charged to the cell by an impure onium hydroxide. The onium<br>
hydroxide which is recovered is of a higher purity than the hydroxide that was charged to the cell.<br>
In one embodiment, a unit cell used in this invention comprises four compartments defined by, in sequence beginning at the anode, a bipolar membrane, a first divider and a second divider, said bipolar membrane having an anion selective side facing the anode and a cation selective side forming the cathode. This arrangement of a unit cell is referred to herein as the BDD arrangement.<br>
An electrochemical cell utilizing the BDD unit cell arrangement is illustrated in Fig. 1 which is a schematic representation of an electrolysis cell 10 comprising an anode 11, a cathode 12 and a unit cell which comprises in sequence, beginning at the anode 11, a bipolar membrane 13, a first divider 14, and a second divider 15. The bipolar membrane 13 has an anion selective side (not shown) facing the anode, and a cation selective side (not shown) facing the cathode. The electrolysis cell 10 illustrated in Fig. 1 comprises four compartments: an anolyte compartment 16 containing the anode 11 and separated from the remainder of the unit cell by the bipolar membrane 13; a catholyte compartment 19 containing the cathode 12 and separated from the remainder of the unit cell by the second divider 15; an internal compartment 17 located between the bipolar membrane 13 and the first divider 14; the second internal compartment 18 between the first divider 14 and the second divider 15.<br>
In operation of the electrochemical cell illustrated in Fig. 1, a solution of an onium salt such as tetra n-butyl ammonium chloride (or an impure onium hydroxide such as tetra n-butyl ammonium hydroxide) is charged to the compartment 18 formed by the first divider and the second divider, and a liquid electrolyte such as an organic salt, water or a mixture of an organic salt and water is charged to the other compartments. An electrical potential is established and maintained between the anode and the cathode to produce a flow of current across the cell whereupon the<br>
quaternary ammonium cation is attracted to the cathode and passes through the second divider 15 into the catholyte compartment 19. The quaternary ammonium cation combines with the hydroxide ion formed at the cathode to produce the desired quaternary ammonium hydroxide. The anion of the quaternary ammonium salt is attracted to the anode and passes through the first divider 14 to compartment 17 where the anion combines with a hydrogen cation produced at the bipolar membrane. An acid is formed in compartment 17 which can be covered. When the quaternary ammonium salt is charged to compartment 18 in Fig. 1 is tetra n-butyl ammonium chloride, tetra n-butyl ammonium hydroxide is formed and recovered from the catholyte compartment 19, and hydrochloric acid is recovered from compartment 17.<br>
In another embodiment, the unit cell is similar to the cell shown in Fig. 1 and comprises four compartments defined by, in sequence, beginning at the anode, a bipolar membrane, an anion selective membrane and a cation selected membrane, said bipolar membrane having an anion selective side facing the anode and a cation selective side facing the cathode. This arrangement is referred to herein as the BAC arrangement (bipolar/anion selective/ cation selective membranes).<br>
An electrolytic cell utilizing the BAC unit cell is illustrated in Fig. 2 which is a schematic representation of an electrolytic cell 20 comprising an anode 21, a cathode 22 and a unit cell comprising in sequence, beginning at the anode 21, a bipolar membrane 23, an anion selective membrane 24, and a cation selective membrane 25. The bipolar membrane 23 has an anion selective side (not shown) facing the anode, and a cation selective side (not shown) facing the cathode. The electrolytic cell 20 illustrated in Fig. 2 comprises four compartments: an anolyte compartment 26 containing the anode 21 and separated from the remainder of the unit cell by the bipolar membrane 23; a catholyte compartment 29 containing the cathode 22 and separated from the remainder of the unit cell by the cation selective<br>
membrane 25; an internal compartment 27 located between the bipolar membrane 23 and the anion selective membrane 24; and a second internal compartment 28 between the anion selective membrane 24 and the cation selective membrane 25.<br>
In operation of the electrolytic cell illustrated in Fig. 2, a solution of an onium salt such as tetramethylammonium chloride (or an impure onium hydroxide) in an electrolyte, preferably water is charged to compartment 28 formed by the anion selective membrane and the cation selective membrane. A liquid electrolyte such as an organic solvent, water or a mixture of an organic solvent and water is charged to the other compartments. Generally, the liquid electrolytes will comprise oxidizable liquids which can react at the anode. Examples of such oxidizable liquids include water, alcohols such as methanol, ethanol, propanol, ethylene glycol and diethylene glycol, hydrocarbons such as hexane, heptane, benzene, toluene, xylene, etc. Mixtures of such liquids may be utilized. Water, alcohols or mixtures of water and alcohols are preferred, and water is the most preferred example of a liquid electrolyte useful in the present invention. The concentration of the quaternary ammonium salt in the solution charged to the compartment defined by the anion selective membrane and the cation selective membrane is generally in the range of from about 3% to about 55% by weight, more often in the range of 5% to about 40% by weight.<br>
After the solution of the quaternary ammonium salt (or the impure onium hydroxide) and the liquid electrolyte have been charged to the indicated compartments of the unit cell, an electrical potential is established and maintained between the anode and the cathode to produce a flow of current across the cell whereupon the quaternary ammonium cation passes through the cation selective membrane and into the catholyte compartment 29. The quaternary ammonium cation combines the hydroxide ion formed at the cathode to produce the desired quaternary ammonium hydroxide. The anion of the quaternary ammonium salt passes through the anion selective<br>
membrane 24 into compartment 27 where the anion combines with a proton produced at the bipolar membrane. An acid is formed in compartment 27 which can be recovered. When the quaternary ammonium salt charged to compartment 28 in Fig. 2 is tetramethylammonium chloride, tetramethylam-monium hydroxide is formed in and recovered from the catholyte compart-ment 29 and hydrochloric acid is recovered from compartment 27.<br>
The electrochemical cells useful in this invention may comprise stacks of two or more unit cells arranged for electrolysis or electrodialysis. Fig. 2A illustrates an electrolytic cell containing a stack of two unit cells in a monopolar configuration, and Fig. 2B illustrates an electrolyte cell containing 2 unit cells in a bipolar configuration.<br>

alloys thereof, or a mixture of electroconductive oxides comprising at least one oxide or mixed oxides of a noble metal such as platinum, iridium, ruthenium, palladium or rhodium.<br>
The cathodes in the electrochemical cells utilized in the process of the present invention comprise any conductive material. Preferably the conductive metal is stable under the conditions present in the electrochemiÂ¬cal cell (e.g. alkaline conditions), and the cathode comprises a material having a low overvoltage for hydrogen evolution. Some specific examples of materials useful as cathodes include stainless steel, nickel, titanium, graphite or carbon steel (iron).<br>
The dividers or separators which can be utilized in the present invention can be selected from a wide variety of microporous diffusion barriers, screens, filters, diaphragms, etc., which contain pores of the desired size to allow the onium cations to migrate toward the cathode. The microporous dividers can be prepared from various materials including plastics such as polyethylene, polypropylene and Teflon, ceramics, etc. Specific examples of commercially available microporous separators include: Celanese Celgard and Norton Zitex. Microporous separators are particularly useful when the process of the present invention is utilized to prepare the higher molecular weight hydroxides such as tetra and butyl phosphonium hydroxide and tetra n-butyl ammonium hydroxide.<br>
The cation selective membranes used in the cells and the process of the invention may be any of those which have been used in the electrolysis of onium salts to onium hydroxides. Preferably, the cation-exchange membranes should comprise a highly durable material such as the membranes based on the fluorocarbon series, or from less expensive materials of the polystyrene or polypropylene series. Preferably, however, the cation selective membranes useful in the present invention include fluorinated membranes containing cation selective groups such as perfluoro-sulfonic acid and perfluorosulfonic and/perfluorocarboxylic acid, perfluoro-<br>
carbon polymer membranes such as sold by the E.I. dupont Nemours &amp; Co. under the general trade designation "Nafion" such as DuPont's Cationic Nafion 902 membrane. Other suitable cation selective membranes include styrenedivinyl benzene copolymer membranes containing cation selective groups such as sulfonate groups, carboxylate groups, etc. Raipore Cationic R1010, (from Pall RAI), and NEOSEPTA CMH and NEOSEPTA CM1 membranes from Tokuyama Soda are useful particularly with the higher molecular quaternary salts. The preparation and structure of cation selective membranes are described in the chapter entitled "Membrane Technology" in Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology, Kirk-Othmer, Third Ed., Vol. 15, pp. 92-131, Wiley &amp; Sons, New York, 1985. These pages are hereby incorpoÂ¬rated by reference for their disclosure of various cation selective membranes which can be useful in the process of the present invention.<br>
Any anion selective membrane may be utilized including membranes used in processes for the desalination of brackish water. Preferably, membranes should be selective with respect to the particular anions present in the cell (e.g., halide ions). The preparation and structure of anionic membranes are described in the chapter entitled "Membrane Technology" in Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology, Kirk-Othmer, Third Ed., Vol. 15, pp. 92-131, Wiley &amp; Sons, New York, 1985. These pages are hereby incorporated by reference for their disclosure of various anionic membranes which may be useful in the process of the present invention.<br>
Among the anion selective membranes which may be utilized and which are commercially available are the following: AMFLON, Series 310, based on fluorinated polymer substituted with quaternary ammonium groups produced by American Machine and Foundry Company; IONAC MA 3148, MA 3236 and MA 3475, based on polymer substituted with quaternary ammonium derived from heterogenous polyvinylchloride produced by Ritter-Pfaulder Corp., Permutit Division; Tosflex IE-SF 34 or IE-SA 48 made by Tosoh Corp. which is a membrane designed to be stable in alkaline<br>
media; NEOSEPTA AMH, NEOSEPTA ACM, NEOSEPTA AFN or NEOSEPTA ACLE-SP from Tokuyama Soda Co.; and Selemion AMV and Selemion AAV from Asahi Glass. In one embodiment, the Tosflex IE-SF 34 and NEOSEPTA AMH anion exchange membranes are preferred because of their stability in alkaline solutions such as the onium hydroxide solution which are formed in the process of the invention.<br>
One of the advantages of the process of the present invention is that the process produces HCI rather than CI2 gas. The bipolar membrane utilized in the process of the present invention prevent the chloride anion from approaching the anode and thereby prevents chlorine gas formation. In the embodiment of Figs. 5 and 6, higher purity quaternary ammonium hydroxide is obtained since the quaternary ammonium cation passes through two cation selective membranes resulting in lower contamination of the desired hydroxide by other anions such as chloride ion.<br>
The bipolar membranes used in the electrochemical cells are composite membranes comprising three parts: a cation selective side or region, an anion selective side or region, and an interface between the two regions. When a direct current passes across a bipolar membrane, with the cation selective side toward or facing the cathode, electrical conduction is achieved by the transport of H+ and OH- ions which are produced by the dissociation of water which occurs at the interface under the influence of an electrical field. Bipolar membranes are described, for example, in U.S. Patents 2,829,095, 4,024,043 (single film bipolar membranes) and in 4,116,889 (cast bipolar membranes). The bipolar membranes useful in the process of the present invention include NEOSEPTA BIPOLAR 1 by Tokuyama Soda, WSI BIPOLAR, and Aqualytics Bipolar membranes.<br>
The current which is passed through the electrochemical cell generally is a direct current of a voltage dictated by the design and performance characterist.cs of the cell which are readily apparent to those skilled in the art and/or can be determined by routine experimentation.<br>
Current densities between 0.1 and 1.5 amps per square inch are generally used, and current densities between 0.6 and 1.2 amps per square inch are preferred. Higher or lower current densities can be used for certain specific applications.<br>
During the electrochemical process, it is generally desirable that the temperature of the liquids within the cell be maintained within the range of from about 10Â°C to about 70Â°C and more generally, the temperature is maintained at about 50Â°C during the electrochemical process.<br>
