				<td>Description :<br>
The invention concerns a pressure roller mounted on rolling bearings for textile machines, in particular for texturing machines, with an elastic cover pulled on an outer ring.<br>
Such pressure rollers mounted on rolling bearings with elastic cover for transport or for drawing a thread in textile machines are already known. The rollers nip the thread between the feeder roils and the rubber cover. This rubber cover must be uniformly pressed onto the feeder roils for disturbance-free transport. This ensures that the cover is invariably aligned parallel to the feeder rolls, the cover's mounting having to have a degree of freedom. This degree of freedom must also be relatively large, so that the admissible tolerances in the machine stand are not too close between the attachment of the feeder rolls and the attachment of the swivel lever. For this reason, the proposal was made in DE 17 60 142 A1 to mount the pressure rollers to be free-floating, so that they can move like a pendulum on the level formed by their rotary axle and the axle of the feeder cylinder of the feeder rolls. To this end, the rotation axle of the pressure roller is attached to a swivelling axle. However, this solution is relatively expensive due to the requisite mounting of the assembly and also due to<br><br>
-2-<br>
the necessary, very precisely aligned mounting on the machine. DE 29 23 871 proposes a pressure roller suspended like a pendulum on a bolt facing the roller's axle. This solution is also relatively expensive. Moreover, the pressure rollers can only be released from the machine with tools being used, according to the state-of-the-art in order to re-sand the elastic cover. This re-sanding is necessary several times a year due to the wear on the elastic cover-Either the pressure rotters according to the state-of-the-art must be around with the axle, or the axie must be removed in a separate step prior to sanding.<br>
The present invention is based on the task of proposing a pressure roller which, is simple in design, and can be removed from the machine quickly without the use of a tool. A pressure roller mounted on roiling bearing for textile machines, particularly for texturing machines, having an elastic cover pulled onto an outer ring of the pressure rofler, whereby the outer ring is attached to the axle of the pressure roller by means of a rapid closure device that can be released without the aid of tools, characterized in that said outer ring is heid by an outer cover which may be latched to the axie or to a roller bearing mounting ring of the axle or may be attached by means of a bayonet catch or screw fastener.<br>
Should the pressure roller's cover be re-sanded, the outer ring with the cover can now be removed from the axie in a simple manner and subsequently sanded. The outer ring can be direcltly clamped into the corresponding sanding machine. It is not necessary to remove the axle separately. Provision of a rapid closure device also simplifies the design and assembly of the pressure rofeer, since special, means of attachment can be done without. The rapid closure device can, by way of example, be formed by a snap-on connection. It is possible, for instance, to retain the outer ring by an outer cover or external cap which can engage on the axte or on a rolling bearing mounting or take-up ring of the axfe, thus firmly retaining the outer ring on the axle. Here, the rolling bearing take-up ring can be made of plastic.<br><br>

There are further advantages when the pressure roller's axle is designed spherically. A swivelling axle is thus not necessary for suspending the pressure roller like a pendulum. Moreover, replacement of the cylindrical shaft by a spherically designed shaft results in a lower surface ioad of the swivel bearing. This solution also requires fewer parts and is thus more cost-efficient<br>
Brief Description of the Accompanying Drawings:<br>
A select example of execution of a pressure roller according to this invention is described in greater detail, based on .the drawings, below.<br>
Fig. 1	a sectional view of a pressure roller as an exploded diagram;<br>
Fig. 2	a section through the assembled pressure roller from Fig. 1.<br>
Pressure roller 10 from Figs. 1 and 2 has outer ring 11 with elastic cover 12 pulled over it. Rolling bearing 13 is appointed on the inside of outer ring 11. As shown in Fig. 1, outer ring 11 with cover 12 and rolling bearing 13 is removable from axle 14 for pressure roller 10. Axle 14 has a spherical section 14.1, on which rolling bearing take-up ring 15 can be attached. To assemble pressure roller 10, an inner cover 16 and then rolling bearing take-up ring 15 are slipped onto axle 14, before the unit comprising outer ring 11, cover 12 and rolling bearing 13 is slipped onto rolling bearing take-up ring 15. The unit made up of outer ring 11, cover 12 and rolling bearing 13 is fixed ontr axle 14 by a cap 17, which can engage in the front side of rolling bearing take-up ring 15, as shown in Fig. 2. The spherical part 14.1 of axie 14 ensures that pressure roller 10 can be aligned in parallel as a pendulum to the<br><br>
-4-<br>
surface of the feeder rolls not described in any further detail. The easily releasable snap-on connection between cap 17 and rolling bearing take-up ring 15 enables outer ring 11 to be rapidly removed, with cover 12, from axle 14, when cover 12 has to be re-sanded due to signs of wear. Subsequent assembly can also bo effected simply and like removal is possible without any tools. Here, rolling bearing 13 must not be jointly removed with outer ring 11 and axle. It might also form one unit with rolling bearing take-up ring 15, and only outer ring 11 as well as cover 12 be designed to be removable. Instead of a snap-on connection between cap 17 and rolling bearing take-up ring 15, a bayonet catch or screw closure might also be provided.<br><br>
