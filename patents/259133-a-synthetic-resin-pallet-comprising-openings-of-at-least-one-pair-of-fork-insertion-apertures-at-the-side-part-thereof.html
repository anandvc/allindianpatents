TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001]<br>
The present* invention relates to a synthetic resin pallet which is used to transport<br>
and store various articles and which can be transported by a forklift, pallet truck, etc.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
[0002]<br>
In general, a synthetic resin pallet which is formed by injecting a synthetic resin<br>
is used as a pallet for transportation and storage of various articles. For example,<br>
Japanese Unexamined Patent Applications, First Publication Nos. 2001-72063 and<br>
2000-16430 disclose a synthetic resin pallet to which forks of a forklift and the like are<br>
inserted in two directions, and a synthetic resin pallet to which the forks are inserted in<br>
four directions.<br>
[0003]<br>
These synthetic resin pallets comprise an upper plate part and a lower plate part<br>
which are positioned in parallel each other, and columns connecting between the upper<br>
plate part and the lower plate part. The upper and lower plate parts are connected by the<br>
columns which are arranged on the both sides and the middle of the upper and lower<br>
plate parts. There is a pair of fork insertion apertures at the space between the upper<br>
and lower plate parts. Specifically, a side part surrounding a space between the upper<br>
and lower plate parts comprises the columns and the fork insertion apertures.<br>
[0004]<br>
The synthetic resin pallet is used to transport and store articles in a bulk.<br>
Specifically, a pair of forks of a forklift or a pallet truck is inserted into the fork insertion<br>
apertures of the synthetic resin pallet while articles are put on the upper side of the<br>
synthetic resin pallet, and the synthetic resin pallet together with the articles is<br>
transported to the bed of a truck or a storage area.<br>
[0005]<br>
However, when plural synthetic resin pallets are arranged in a row along the<br>
depth direction of a bed of a truck comprising a bed which opens only at the rear side,<br><br>
and the depth of the bed is much longer than the length of the forks, since the synthetic<br>
pallets have to be loaded from the rear opening, it is impossible to position the synthetic<br>
resin pallets at the front portion of the bed.<br>
As explained above, in the case where the synthetic resin pallets are not<br>
positioned at a desired position while the forks of a forklift are inserted in the fork<br>
insertion apertures, the synthetic resin pallet is moved forward by pushing the side part of<br>
the synthetic resin pallet with the tip of the forks of a forklift or the like.<br>
[0006]<br>
In order to make a conventional synthetic resin pallet move forward, the tip of<br>
the forks is contacted with the columns next to the fork insertion apertures. Specifically,<br>
after putting the synthetic resin pallet on the bed of the truck, the forklift is moved<br>
backward to pull the forks from the fork insertion apertures. Then, the forklift moves in<br>
the width direction to adjust the position of the forks so as to be able to contact the<br>
column, and the forklift moves forward to push the column by the forks. Therefore, a<br>
large amount of time and labor are required to push the synthetic resin pallet.<br>
[0007]<br>
In addition, since the movement of forks in the width direction is restricted, the<br>
interval between forks sometimes cannot be adjusted such that the tip of the forks<br>
contacts the columns which are positioned at both ends of the synthetic resin pallet.<br>
In such a case, the fork pushes a center column alone between the fork insertion apertures<br>
or the center column and the column positioned at one end of the synthetic resin pallet.<br>
Then the synthetic resin pallet is pushed without keeping balance, and there is a case<br>
where the synthetic resin pallet inclines in the pushing direction and the synthetic resin<br>
pallet cannot be positioned at a desired position or articles on the synthetic resin pallet<br>
collapse.<br>
[0008]<br>
Japanese Patent (Granted) Publication No. 2880657 discloses a synthetic resin<br>
pallet which solves the problems and comprises a fork locking portion for locking the tip<br>
of the forks. In the synthetic resin pallet, an upper plate part is larger than a lower plate<br>
part, and the upper plate part protrudes from the side part of the synthetic resin pallet and<br>
forms the fork locking portion. The fork locking portion comprises a front contacted<br>
part to which the tip of the forks contacts and an upper contacted part for preventing the<br>
fork from moving upward.<br><br>
[0009]<br>
In the synthetic resin pallet having such a structure, since the tip of the forks<br>
contact and is locked to the fork locking portion and pushes the synthetic resin while<br>
keeping balance, it is possible to transport the synthetic resin pallet together with articles<br>
to a desired position without collapse of the articles on the synthetic resin pallet.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
PROBLEMS TO BE SOLVED<br>
[0010]<br>
However, in the synthetic resin pallet comprising the fork locking portion, since<br>
the fork locking portion is formed to the upper plate part so as to protrude, the strength of<br>
the fork locking portion is insufficient and there is a concern that the fork locking portion<br>
may be damaged by the forks while being pushed.<br>
In addition, when the synthetic resin pallet is pushed, and the forks come free<br>
from the fork locking portion, there is a concern that a body of the forklift hits the<br>
synthetic resin pallet and articles on the synthetic resin pallet could collapse.<br>
Furthermore, since the fork locking portion protrudes significantly from the<br>
upper plate part, there is also a concern that a number of synthetic resin pallets arranged<br>
on the ground decreases, and a capacity of the synthetic resin pallets on the bed of a truck<br>
or a storage area also decreases.<br>
[0011]<br>
In consideration of the above-described problems, it is an object of the present<br>
invention to provide a synthetic resin pallet which can be pushed forward reliably with<br>
ease, and a capacity of a bed of a truck or a storage area is not limited unnecessarily.<br>
Means for solving the problem<br>
[0012]<br>
The synthetic resin pallet of the present invention comprises an upper plate part<br>
and a lower plate part which are positioned so as to face each other, a side part<br>
surrounding the space between the upper plate part and the lower plate part, and openings<br>
of at least one pair of fork insertion apertures at the side part, wherein a fork pressed part<br>
formed on the openings so as to make a recess toward the inside of the synthetic resin<br>
pallet, and the fork pressed part comprises a pressed face which is pressed by forks of a<br><br>
' forklift, an upper guide for restricting upward movement of the forks, a lower guide for<br>
restricting downward movement of the forks, and a side guide, for restricting sideward<br>
movement of the forks.<br>
Effects of the present invention<br>
[0013]<br>
According to the synthetic resin pallet of the present invention, since the fork<br>
pressed part is formed on the openings so as to make a recess toward the inside of the<br>
synthetic resin pallet, the synthetic resin-pallet is pushed forward by pushing the fork<br>
pressed part with the tip of the forks of a forklift or the like.<br>
In addition, since the fork pressed part comprises the lower guide for restricting downward movement of the forks, it is possible to prevent the forks from coming free<br>
from the fork pressed part and running in the fork insertion apertures and there is no<br>
concern that a body of the forklift hits the synthetic resin pallet and articles on the<br>
synthetic resin pallet collapse.<br>
[0014]<br>
In addition, since the fork pressed part comprises a side guide for restricting<br>
sideward movement of the forks, when the forks slide sideward, the forks do not come<br>
free from the fork pressed part, and thereby the synthetic resin pallet is pushed stably.<br>
Furthermore, since the fork pressed part is formed so as'to be depressed in the<br>
synthetic resin pallet, and the upper plate part does not protrude from the side part,_ a<br>
number of synthetic resin pallets arranged on the ground is not restricted, and a capacity<br>
of the synthetic resin pallets on the bed of a truck or a storage area decreases.<br>
Furthermore, since the synthetic resin pallet does not comprise a protrusion in the upper<br>
plate part, handling thereof is very easy.<br>
[0015]'<br>
As explained above, the synthetic resin pallet of the present invention is pushed<br>
reliably with ease by a forklift or the like, and a capacity of the synthetic resin pallet in a<br>
bed of a truck or a storage area is not restricted.<br>

BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
[0018]<br>
In the synthetic resin pallet according to the present invention, it is preferable<br>
that reinforcement ribs are formed at the side guide. Sufficient strength of the side<br>
guide is maintained by the reinforcement rib, and damage caused by the forks hitting the<br>
side guide can be prevented.<br>
In the synthetic resin pallet, it is preferable that reinforcement ribs be formed at<br>
the pressed face.<br>
In addition, in the synthetic resin pallet, it is also preferable that a part of the<br>
upper plate part be the upper guide and a part of the lower plate part be the lower guide.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
[0019]<br>
Below, a preferred embodiment of the synthetic resin pallet according to<br>
the present invention will be explained with reference to the figures.<br><br>
FIGS. 1 through 6 show the preferred embodiment of the synthetic resin<br>
pallet of the present invention.<br>
As shown in FIG. 1, a synthetic resin pallet 11 has a substantial box shape<br>
having a rectangular cross-section, and comprises an upper plate part 12 forming<br>
an upper surface of the synthetic resin pallet 11, a lower plate part 13 forming a<br>
lower surface, and columns 14 connecting the upper plate part 12 and the lower<br>
plate part 13. As shown in FIGS. 2 and 3, the upper plate part 12 and the lower<br>
plate part 13 are positioned substantially in parallel.<br>
[0020]<br>
Two pairs of fork insertion apertures 21 and 21, and 22And 22 to be<br>
inserted with forks of a forklift or a pallet truck are formed between the columns<br>
14 and 14 in the synthetic resin pallet 11 having such a structure. The fork<br>
insertion apertures 21 and 21 extending in a longitudinal direction of the synthetic<br>
resin pallet 11 comprise openings 21A and 21A at both short side side-parts 15.<br>
The other insertion apertures 22And 22 extending in a transversal direction to the<br>
longitudinal direction comprise openings 22A and 22A at both long side side-parts<br>
15. That is, the synthetic resin pallet 11 shown in figures is a so-called<br>
four-direction synthetic resin pallet. In the synthetic resin pallet 11, the short<br>
side-side parts 15 comprising the columns 14 and the openings 21A and 21A of<br>
the fork insertion apertures 21 and 21 and the long side-side parts 15 comprising<br>
the columns 14 and the openings 22A and 22A of the fork insertion apertures 22And 22Are arranged in contact and thereby a side part 15 of the synthetic resin<br>
pallet 11 is formed. The side part 15 surrounds the periphery of the upper and<br>
lower plate parts.<br>
[0021]<br>
In the lower plate part 13, plural crosspieces 23 and 23 are provided so as to<br>
have an interval in an orthogonal direction to the insertion direction of the forks of a<br>
forklift or a pallet truck at the bottom region of the fork insertion apertures 21 and 21,<br>
that is, the regions between the columns 14 and 14. Similarly, plural crosspieces 24 and<br>
24 are also provided so as to have an interval in an orthogonal direction to the insertion<br>
direction of the forks of a forklift or a pallet truck at the bottom region of the fork<br>
insertion apertures 22And 22, that is, the regions between the columns 14 and 14.<br>
Moreover, the height of the crosspieces 23 and 23 provided at the bottom of the<br><br>
fork insertion apertures 21 and 21 comprising the openings 21A and 21A at the short<br>
side-side part 15 is lower than the height of the crosspieces 24 and 24 provided at the<br>
bottom of the fork insertion apertures 22And 22 comprising the openings 22A and 22A at<br>
the long side-side part 15.<br>
[0022]<br>
In addition, in the lower plate part 13, plural wheel holes 25, which connect the<br>
fork insertion apertures 21 and 21, are formed at the region surrounded by the columns<br>
14. When forks of a pallet truck are inserted into the fork insertion apertures 21 and 21,<br>
the wheels provided with the forks make contact with ground via the wheel holes 25. In<br>
the synthetic resin pallet 11 of this example, since four wheel holes 25 are provided, the<br>
lower plate part 13 has a square frame comprising a cross frame therein by the<br>
crosspieces 23 and 24.<br>
[0023]<br>
As shown in FIGS. 2 and 3, the fork pressed part 31 is formed between the<br>
openings 21 A, 21 A, 22A, and 22A of the fork insertion apertures 21,21, 22, and 22And<br>
the upper plate part 12. The fork pressed part 31 is a hollow in the longitudinal<br>
direction of the fork insertion apertures. As shown in FIG. 5, the fork pressed part 31<br>
comprises a flat bottom which is positioned vertically relative to the upper plate part 12,<br>
and substantially parallel to the side part 15. The bottom of the fork pressed part 31 is a<br>
pressed face 32 to which the tip of the forks contacts. The upper plate part 11 on the<br>
pressed face 32 functions as an upper guide 33, and the upper wall of the fork insertion<br>
aperture 21,21, 22, and 22, which is positioned under the pressed face 32, functions as a<br>
lower guide 34.<br>
[0024]<br>
A pair of side guide 35 is formed so as to connect between the upper wall of the<br>
of the fork insertion aperture 21,21,22, and 22And the upper plate part 11 and protrude<br>
vertically from the pressed face 32. Specifically, as shown in FIGS. 2 and 3, the fork<br>
pressed part 31 is formed at the position where it is on the fork insertion aperture 21,21,<br>
22, and 22And between one side wall and the other side wall of the fork insertion<br>
aperture 21,21,22, and 22.<br>
In other words, the fork pressed part 31, which is a recess, is formed along the<br>
upper wall of the fork insertion aperture 21,21,22, and 22. Then, a pair of side guides<br>
35 is formed in the fork pressed part 31 so as to be positioned vertically relative to the<br><br>
pressed face 32.<br>
[0025]<br>
In addition, as shown in FIGS. 2, 3, and 6, the reinforcement ribs 36 are formed<br>
at the back side of the side guides 35 so as to extend parallel to the upper plate part 11<br>
and protrude vertically from the pressed face 32.<br>
In addition, as shown in FIG. 4, reinforcement ribs 37 are also formed on the<br>
back side of the pressed face 32 so as to extend vertically relative to the pressed face 32.<br>
[0026]<br>
The upper face of the synthetic resin pallet 11, that is, the surface of the upper<br>
plate part 12, is a surface to be loaded. In order to stably put articles on the synthetic<br>
resin pallet 11, the surface is flat. In addition, protrusions are formed at the edge<br>
portion of the four sides of the upper plate part 12. The lower plate part 13 comprises<br>
recesses at positions in which the protrusions are put when the synthetic resin pallets 11<br>
are stacked. The synthetic resin pallets 11 can be stacked stably without displacement<br>
by forming the protrusions at the corners of the upper plate part 12 having a square shape<br>
and the recesses in which the protrusions are put at the lower plate part 13.<br>
[0027]<br>
It is possible to transport and store articles in a bulk by loading the articles on<br>
the surface of the upper plate part 12 of the synthetic resin pallet 11 having such a<br>
structure, inserting forks of a forklift or a pallet truck into a pair of the fork insertion<br>
apertures 21 and 21, and transporting the articles together with the synthetic resin pallet<br>
11 to the bed of a truck or a storage area.<br>
[0028]<br>
In this case, the forks of the forklift are inserted into the fork insertion apertures<br>
22And 22 comprising the openings 22A and 22A at the long side-side part 15, and then<br>
the synthetic resin pallet 11 is transported.<br>
In contrast, the fork insertion apertures 21 and 21 comprising the openings 21A<br>
and 21A at the short side-side part 15 are provided with lower crosspieces 23, as<br>
explained above. Due to the height of the crosspieces 23, even a pallet truck provided<br>
with forks comprising wheels at the tips thereof can override easily the crosspiece 23.<br>
Thereby, the wheels of the pallet truck make contact with the ground, and the pallet can<br>
be transported using the pallet truck.<br>
In other words, the fork insertion apertures 22And 22 having the openings 22A<br><br>
and 22A at the long side-side part 15 are suitably used for a forklift, and the fork<br>
insertion apertures 21 and 21 having the openings 21A and 21A are suitably used for a<br>
pallet truck or forklift, in particular, for a pallet truck.<br>
[0029]<br>
Below, the operation, in which the synthetic resin pallet having such a structure<br>
is pushed by the tip of the forks of a forklift to move, will be explained.<br>
The synthetic resin pallet is transported by inserting the forks into the fork<br>
insertion aperture 21 and 21 or 22And 22, and then the synthetic resin pallet 11 is put on<br>
the bed of a truck or the like. After that, the forks are taken out of the fork insertion<br>
aperture 21 and 21 or 22And 22 by moving the forklift backward. The forks are moved<br>
upward and then the fork lift is moved forward. The tip of the forks is inserted in the<br>
fork pressed part 31 and contacts the pressed face 32. The synthetic resin pallet 11 is<br>
pushed forward by moving the forklift forward while maintaining the contacted<br>
conditions between the tip of the forks and the pressed face 32.<br>
[0030]<br>
In the synthetic resin pallet 11 of this example, the fork pressed part 31 is<br>
formed on the fork insertion apertures 21,21,22, and 22, and the synthetic resin pallet 11<br>
is pushed forward by pushing the pressed face 32 with the tip of the forks. Therefore, it<br>
is possible to push forward the synthetic resin pallet 11 by only moving the forklift<br>
backward and adjusting the height of the forks. Thereby, the synthetic resin pallet 11 is<br>
easily pushed forward without sideward movement of the forklift or the forks.<br>
[0031]<br>
In addition, since plural reinforcement ribs 37 are formed at the backside of the<br>
pressed face 32 to which the tip of the forks contact, the strength of the pressed face 32 is<br>
improved. Thereby, it is possible to prevent damage of the pressed face 32 caused by<br>
pushing with the tip of the forks.<br>
Since the lower guide 34 for preventing the downward movement of the forks is<br>
formed, it is possible to prevent the forks from coming free from the fork pressed part 31<br>
and inserting in the fork insertion aperture 21,21,22, and 22, while the synthetic resin<br>
pallet 11 is pushed forward. Due to this, it is possible to prevent the forklift from hitting<br>
to the synthetic resin pallet 11.<br>
[0032]<br>
Since the side guide 35 for preventing the sideward movement of the forks is<br><br>
formed, it is possible to prevent the forks from sliding sideward. Due to this, it is<br>
possible to stably push the synthetic resin pallet 11 forward.<br>
Since the upper guide 33 for preventing the upward movement of the forks is<br>
formed, it is possible to prevent the forks from coming free from the fork pressed part 31,<br>
and damaging articles on the synthetic resin pallet 11.<br>
[0033]<br>
In addition, the area of the upper plate part 12 substantially equals that of the<br>
lower plate part 13, and the upper plate part 12 does not protrude from the side part of the<br>
synthetic resin pallet 11. When the synthetic resin pallets 11 are arranged, the capacity<br>
of the bed of a truck or a storage area is not decreased.<br>
Furthermore, since the reinforcement ribs 36 are formed to the backside of the<br>
side guides 35, and the strength of the side guides 35 is improved, it is possible to<br>
prevent damage to the side guides 35 when hitting them with the forks.<br>
[0034]<br>
The preferred example of the synthetic resin pallet 11 of the present invention<br>
was explained above. However, the present invention is not limited to the above<br>
example, and the constitution of the synthetic resin pallet according to the present<br>
invention can be changed as long as the change of the constitution is within the scope of<br>
the present invention.<br>
For example, the synthetic resin pallet which comprises a pair of fork insertion<br>
apertures extending along in two directions and to which the forks can be inserted from<br>
four directions, that is, a so-called four-direction synthetic resin pallet is explained in this<br>
example. However, the present invention is not limited to this example. The synthetic<br>
resin pallet of the present invention may be a synthetic resin pallet which comprises a<br>
pair of the fork insertion apertures extending along in one direction and to which the<br>
forks can be inserted from two directions, that is, a so-called two-direction synthetic resin<br>
pallet.<br>
Industrial applicability<br>
[0035]<br>
According to the present invention, it is possible to provide the synthetic resin<br>
pallet, which can be pushed reliably with ease, and does not decrease the capacity on the<br>
bed of a truck or a storage area.<br><br>
