				<td>ABSTRACT An improved composition useful for the treatment of black liquor, an effluent from pulp and paper industry and a process for treatment of black liquor The invention relates to an improved composition useful for the treatment of black liquor, an effluent from pulp and paper industry and a process for treatment of black liquor. The pulp and paper industry in India is one of the highly polluting industries. The industry uses on an average 250-300 m3 of fresh water per ton of paper produced and nearly 75% of which is discharged as effluent popularly known as black liquor. Thus it is obvious that the proper treatment of pulp and paper industry effluent (Black Liquor) is quite necessary. This invention related to an improved composition useful for the treatment of black liquor, an effluent from pulp and paper industry and the use there of in such treatment. The novelty of the process lies in the use of flocculating agent, comprising salt from Group I elements, transition metal and natural earth. The process of the present invention removes COD. TDS and color simultaneously from black liquor at ambient temperature, thus saving energy cost, the operation does not involve any use of mineral acid thus, avoiding corrosion problems.</td>

				<td>This invention related to an improved composition useful for the treatment of black liquor, and process therof for treatment of black liquor. More particularly the invention is related to an improved method for the reduction of Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD), Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) and color from the effluents of pulp and paper industry. Despite developments in technologies, the pulp and paper industry particularly in India is seen as smock-stack industry lacking glamorous hitech approach. It is one of the highly polluting industries and the pollutants are released through liquid, solid and gaseous discharges. The industry in other parts of the world has made tremendous progress by adapting total recycling concept, resource conservation and effective environmental management. Paper industries in countries like India and China face problems continuously in the area of environmental management particularly because of low scale of operation, various and mixed raw materials inputs and lack of adequate modernization. The industry uses on an average 250-300m of fresh water per ton of paper produced and nearly 75% of which is discharged as effluent popularly known as black liquor. It contains organic and inorganic pollutants imparting high COD, BOD and dark color. If such untreated wastewater is allowed to accumulate, the decomposition of organic materials it contains can lead to production of malodourous gases. Moreover wastewater contains numerous toxic substances, which affect the aquatic flora and fauna, resulting in loss of productivity of natural waters and deterioration of water quality to such an extent that the water becomes unusable. Thus it is obvious that the proper treatment of pulp and paper industry effluent (Black Liquor) is quite necessary.<br>
The paper and board industries generally use bamboo, straws, bagasse, rags, waste papers and other agricultural residues as raw materials, therefore volume and characteristics of<br><br>
wastewater known as black liquor, differ from industry to industry. Black liquor mainly<br>
contains 3 -6% of lignin originated from the bark of the plant, which is not easily<br>
biodegradable, along with other organic and inorganic impurities. The dark color of the<br>
black liquor is mainly due to presence of polyphenolic bodies like coniferyl, sinapyl and<br>
p- coumaryl alcohols produced during partial degradation of lignin. The pulp &amp; paper<br>
industry uses large amounts of water, which is recycled, and reused resulting in<br>
temperature rise and dissolution of more solids in water enhancing problems e.g.<br>
corrosion, slime and other deposits.<br>
In order to conform to environmental quality guidelines a number of primary and<br>
secondary treatment systems such as clarifiers, aerated lagoons, trickling filters,<br>
biomethanation and other biological systems are installed. All these treatments reduce<br>
reasonably good amount of COD and BOD but not color toxicity and inorganic<br>
impurities. Ultra filtration has also been tried and found futile to remove TDS as well as<br>
color completely. Due to stringent environmental norms, such partially treated effluents<br>
of industries are not allowed to be mixed in the natural stream. In the prior art the<br>
following methods are used to remove COD, BOD, TDS and color of Black Liquor.<br>
Several methods hitherto used are described in brief herein below:<br>
Color removal from a waste effluent by combined use of Fe(II), lime and bone<br>

A study was conducted by Shen et al to remove color from a chem. manufg. effluent.<br>
The effluent contained high levels of sol. org. compds. The effluent was intensely black;<br>
the high soly. of colored constituents made common coagulation or adsorption techniques<br>
unsuitable for color removal. Results showed that a combination of FeC12:4H2O (as a<br>
reducing agent), lime, and bone charcoal removed 97% of the color.<br>

Wyatt et al. observed that aqueous medium enzyme compns. are provided which are<br>
suitable for degrading natural fibers inclusive of cellulose-based and protein-based fibers<br>
resulting in release of adsorbed, absorbed and/or entrained petroleum products and<br>
radioactive contaminants. A method is presented for releasing petroleum and<br>
hydrocarbon products sorbed onto or entrained by natural fibers in an aq. medium<br>
through the use of enzymes to degrade the natural fiber sorbents utilized for oil spill<br>
cleanup, the method provides an opportunity for achieving responsible sepn. of oil from<br>
oil spill sorbent materials. A method is also presented for prepg. cellulosic linter fibers<br>

Three white-rot fungi (IZU-154, Phanerochaete chrysosporium Burds and Coriolus<br>
versicoloy (L. ex Fr.) Quel.) were tested by Lee et al for their abilities to decolorize kraft<br>
bleaching effluents from the 1st alk. extn. stage. The fungus IZU-154 exhibited the<br>
effective decolorization of not only hardwood but also softwood kraft pulp bleaching<br>
effluent. For the softwood bleach plant effluent contg. 10,000 color units (CU) ,<br>
treatment with IZU-154 in the presence of a small amt. of glucose (0.5%) resulted in 78%<br>
and 89% redn. of the color after one- and two-day incubation, resp. On the other hand,<br>
when the effluent was treated under the same conditions, only 32% and 36% of the<br>
decolorization with C versicolor and 49% and 72% of the decolonization with P.<br>
chrysosporium were obsd. within one- and two-day incubations, resfectively. In<br>
comparison with 53% and 78% of color redns. achieved by IZU-154 with the softwood<br>
bleach plant effluent including glucose, addn. of glucono-d-lactone to the effluent<br>
showed remarkable decolorizations of 83% and 94% within 12- and 24-h incubations.<br>
resp. Furthermore, the color of the effluent was effectively removed by the addn. of<br>
acetic acid as an additive. Therefore, a greater color redn. by IZU-154 can be expected<br>
for a possible biotechnol. application.<br>

Decolorization of wastewater treatment plant effluent contg. molasses pigment by gamma<br>
irradn. was studied by Sawai et al. The COD decreased and the dark brown color of the<br>
12<br>
effluent faded away with increasing radiation dosage. The high mol. wt. components of<br>
molasses pigment were degraded to lower mol. wt. substances and were decompd. finally<br>
to carbon dioxide. Org. acids, such as formic, acetic, oxalic, citric, and succinic acid<br>
were formed as intermediates. The radiation treatment was enhanced by the addn. of<br>

A soln. of molasses wastewater, pretreated by activated sludge, was ozonated and then<br>
completely decolorized by ozone by Ichikawa et al. Total org. C (TOC) could be<br>
reduced only to -50% during a period of 60 min ozonization. The ozonated soln., after<br>
being mixed with activated sludge culture, was incubated for 10 days at 25°, and<br>
biodegradability was then assessed by dissolved org. C (DOC) redn. DOC of the<br>
nonozonated soln. could hardly be reduced even after 10 days incubation, indicating<br>
biodegradability. For the ozonated soln. of pretreated molasses wastewater, a DOC<br>
removal of 70% was achieved and DOC in the soln. was 
greatly improved the biodegradability of refractory org. compounds. A soln. of molasses<br>
wastewater was ozonated directly. Ozone decolorized -90% of the molasses wastewater<br>
but TOC was reduced to only -8%. Biodegradability of ozonated molasses wastewater<br>
was improved.<br>
An improved process for the treatment of black liquor waste from paper mills<br>
In our copending application no. 796/Del/97, we have described a process for treatment<br>
of black liquor which comprises separation of lignin from black liquor waste of paper<br>
mills using flocculant consisting of salts from Group -IA, preferably sulphated of<br>
aluminum, alkali metal salts from Group-HA preferably calcium chloride, transition<br>
metals preferably iron and earth such as dolomite or bentonite. The lime is added to attain<br>
the pH at 10-12 and then mixture of above flocculant is added. The lignin along with<br>
other organic and inorganic impurities gets precipitated and pH of the treated effluent is<br>
highly alkaline. The treated effluent is passed over bed of ion exchange resins to obtain a<br>
clear colourless effluent.<br>
In the above mentioned patent application the lime is used and even the flocculating<br>
mixture contains alum. Because of the use of lime the pH of the treated effluent ranges<br>
from 10-12. This requires initial as well as final pH adjustment to neutral value before<br>
disposing to natural streams. This also generates large quantity of sludge imparting solid<br>
waste disposal problem. The present invention attempts to remove this drawback wherein<br>
the use of lime and alum is totally eliminated because of which there is no problem of pH<br>
adjustment by adding additional chemicals and the sludge removal. The novelty of the<br>
present invention therefore lies in treating the effluent with out any dilution, avoiding the<br>
use of lime necessitating the initial and final pH adjustments which require the use of<br>
scarce resources like water, environmental friendly deletion of use of lime and sludge<br>
disposal problem which could have cause further environmental damage.<br>
In the hitherto known processes main drawbacks are use of acidic media, which involves<br>
corrosion problems, filtration problems due to colloidal nature of the particles and<br>
incomplete removal of organic, inorganic matter as well as colour (mainly due to the<br>
presence of lignin and mellanoidins) of the effluent water.<br>
There is continued interest on development of new improved process for removal of color<br>
and other organic &amp; inorganic impurities produced during the manufacturing process of<br>
paper and pulp. It is a well-known fact that organics, inorganics as well as color in such<br>
type of effluents are not easily biodegradable and hence, have disposal problems in the<br>
natural environment.<br>
The main objective of the present invention is therefore to provide an improved<br>
composition for the treatment of black liquor an effluent from paper and pulp industry.<br>
Another objective is to provide an improved process using the said composition for<br>
treatment of black liquor.<br>
Still another object is to provide a process eliminating the use of lime and alum resulting<br>
in environmentally friendly process for such treatment of black liquor.<br>
Yet another object is to provide a process which reduces/ eliminates use of scarce natural<br>
resources like water for dilution of the black liquor before treatment.<br>
The process of the present invention removes COD, TDS and color simultaneously from<br>
black liquor an effluent from pulp and paper industry at 20 to 40°C temperature, thus<br>
saving energy cost, the operation does not involve any use of mineral acid thus, avoidingcorrosion problems. The novelty of the process lies in the use of flocculating agent, comprising salt from Group I elements, transition metal and natural earth.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides an improved composition for treatment of black liquor effluent generated from paper and pulp industry, which comprises an Inorganic Ferrous salt selected from sulfate, chloride, nitrate preferably ferrous sulphate in the range of 40 to 50 wt%, an Inorganic alkaline metal salt such as chlorides, carbonates, nitrates, sulphates of the metals of Group-II A, exemplified by sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate, lithium carbonate preferably sodium carbonate in the range of 18 to 50 wt%, and optionally a solidifying agent such as natural earths, sand, fullers earth, dolomite, bentonite    preferably dolomite in the range of 0 to 42 wt%.<br>
The present invention also provides the process thereof using the composition provided hereinabove for treatment of effluents from paper and pulp industry and which comprise mixing the effluent from paper and pulp industry with the composition initially under agitation for a period of 1-10 minutes at ambient temperature, allowing to settle for a further period of 30-120 minutes, to obtain the treated black liquor in the supernatant.<br><br>
In an embodiment of the present invention the concentration of the composition with<br>
black liquor may range from 0.8:1 to 1.25:1.<br>
In one of the features of the present invention, treatment was done at original pH of the<br>
black liquor and thereby avoiding pH adjustment of the final treated effluent before<br>
disposal, wherein when calcium carbonate and chloride is used, as a flocculating agent<br>
pH adjustment is mandatory before and after the treatment. Also handling of calcium<br>
carbonate and chloride at large scale operations is problematic.<br>
In the features of the present invention all the operations of the treatment were carried out<br>
at ambient temperature without any use of mineral acid.<br>
In the feature of the present invention after the treatment of the Black liquor, significant<br>
reduction of color, TDS and COD was observed.<br>
In the features of the present invention it was observed that use of sodium carbonate as a<br>
flocculating agent is advantageous cost-wise, compared to other carbonates like lithium,<br>
potassium and calcium. The sludge volume and its dry weight is comparably less when<br>
sodium carbonate is used instead of calcium carbonate and chloride as a flocculating<br>
agent. Sodium carbonate (washing soda) is a non-phosphate water softener and boost<br>
cleaning power of plain water. Therefore use of washing soda as flocculent in effluent<br>
treatment is non-hazardous as well as non-toxic in nature.<br>
Although the process provided by the present invention for the treatment of black liquor<br>
from paper and pulp industry using the composition as above mentioned is useful for<br>
most of the paper industries the concentration of the composition used for the treatment<br>
may vary depending upon the initial characteristics of. the black liquor particularly the<br>
COD level which should be preferably below 3000 ppm. If COD exceeds 3000 ppm,<br>
higher dosage of the composition is required to obtain better results.<br>
The process of the present invention is described herein bellow with reference to the<br>
examples which are illustrative only and should not be construed to the limit of scope of<br>
the present invention in any manner.<br>
Example -1<br>
500 ml Black Liquor generated from pulp and paper industry (COD - 1412 ppm and IDS<br>
2320 ppm of pH- 9.7) was taken in 1000 ml beaker to which flocculent comprising of<br>
mixture of ferrous sulphate, washing soda and dolomite (550mg) in 25:10:20 proportion<br>
was added and mixed thoroughly and poured in a 500 ml measuring cylinder and allowed<br>
to settle for 30 minutes at ambient temperature. The supernatant thus obtained was<br>
analyzed for its COD, TDS and color reduction using spectrophotometer at 580 nm. The<br>
treated sample of the Black Liquor showed COD as 471 ppm, TDS 1710 ppm and color<br>
reduction was found to be 90%.<br>

proportion was added and mixed thoroughly and poured in a 100 ml measuring cylinder<br>
and allowed to settle for 30 minutes at ambient temperature. The supernatant thus<br>
obtained was analyzed for its COD, TDS and color reduction using spectrophotometer at<br>
580 nm. The treated sample of the Black Liquor showed COD 465 ppm, TDS 1640 ppm<br>
and color reduction was found to be 92%.<br>

mixed thoroughly and poured in a 50 ml measuring cylinder and allowed to settle for 30<br>
minutes at ambient temperature. The supernatant thus obtained was analyzed for its COD,<br>
IDS and color reduction using spectrophotometer at 580 nm. The treated sample of the<br>
Black Liquor showed COD as 500 ppm, TDS 1230 ppm and color reduction was found to<br>
be 88%.<br>
Advantages of the invention:<br>
