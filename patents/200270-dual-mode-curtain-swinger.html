Invention<br>
A Curtain Rod housing an arrangement to facilitate opening and closing of the<br>
screen clothe by pull of a rope. Background of Invention<br>
The Dual Mode Curtain Swinger for use in the field of Interior Decoration is designed with a view of eliminating the following drawbacks associated with the Curtain Rods used at present:<br>
Wherein cut to length steel tubes (fitted with decorative rod ends or hidden inside a wood frame) or aluminum channels/tubes (with plastic coating) are used which do not have a system to open or close the curtain. The cloth is handled to open or close the screen.<br>
Wherever the curtain moving arrangement is provided such as in custom made<br>
vertical blinds or Venetian blinds they do get struck and bent in due course. Also<br>
removing them from the operating arrangement for cleaning is rendered difficult.<br>
Though expensive, the vertical blinds/venetian blinds are available only in few<br>
colors thus giving a poor look. Sun control films fade away in a short time<br>
requiring frequent replacement.<br>
Object of Invention<br>
Object of this invention is to provide a curtain rod with following features:<br>
The buyer can fit or remove the rod/cloth without meddling with operating system.<br>
The curtain can be opened or closed by pulling a rope without handling the cloth.<br>
The hooks will form the decorative frills avoiding permanent stitching.<br>
The entire rod can be hidden under the curtain, avoiding wooden frames/rod ends.<br>
Cloths of varied designs and colors can be used as Screen<br>
The rod can be shifted anywhere as it is durable and its length is adjustable.<br>
And Dual Mode Curtain Swinger houses all these features in it.<br><br>
A Summary of Invention<br>
The Dual Mode Curtain Swinger for Curtains and Screens of doors, windows and other openings comprises of two feet long Channels of larger and smaller diameters, for inserting the channel of smaller dia in the channel of larger dia to form track, housed with Guides fitted on to Carriers and Spacers travelling in the track, closed at both ends with Left and Right End Brackets fastened with two Wheels and a Rear Support Plate, then inserting this Curtain Rod Assembly through Center Support Plates in the flaps provided on Adjustable Plates fastened to Wall Mounting Brackets that are nailed to wall and hanging one end of the Hooks carrying curtain in the holes provided in Carrier and Spacers and inserting the other end of the Hooks in the holes provided in the Nylon/Cotton Strip that will be stitched on to the Curtain, and then the Wheels and Carriers are tied with Nylon/Cotton Ropes to provide an operating mechanism for opening and closing the curtain.<br>
In this, Steel Channels of uniform length (inserting smaller dia channel in larger dia channel) are used as Curtain Rod. In the channel groove, metal Carriers (Left and Right) and plastic spacers are inserted   At both ends of the Channel, metal Rod End Brackets (fastened with plastic wheels) are provided. A Nylon rope is inserted through the wheel and tied to the Carriers. Thus, pulling the rope causes forward/backward movement of the Carriers as also the Spacers inserted behind these carriers.<br>
Metal Wall Mounting Brackets fitted with Adjustable Plates are nailed to the wall at required distance and the End Brackets fitted with the curtain rod are inserted into the Adjustable Plates.<br>
A Nylon Strip/Tape (provided with holes for inserting hooks) is stitched onto the Curtain cloth. One end of the hooks is inserted in the tape and the other in the Spacer holes.  Now, a pull of the rope rotates the wheel causing movement of the carriers, which in tum pushes or pulls the spacers and the curtain hung on them.<br><br>

Detailed description of the Invention with reference to drawings<br>
Figure 1	shows the design of Inner Channel and Outer Channel used in the<br>
Dual Mode Curtain Swinger.<br>
These Channels are uniform in length (about 24 inches) but the diameter of Inner Channel is smaller ihan the Outer Channel. The Inner Channel is inserted in the Outer Channel to form a track. More Inner or Outer Channels are used for additional length.<br>
Figure 2        shows the design of Left and Right Carriers. These Carriers are provided with two rivet holes (for fastening the Guide) and slots (for tying the rope) on top, and holes at the bottom (for hanging the curtain-carrying hooks).<br><br>
Figure 3        shows the design of Carrier Guide.<br>
This Guide is provided with two rivet holes and a slot (for inserting rope) on the sides and groove at top and bottom (for traveiUng in the track). The Carrier Guide is riveted with Left and Right Carriers and the groove is inserted in the channel track enabling movement of the Carriers back and forth.<br>
Figure 4        shows the design of Spacers.<br>
These Spacers are provided with a projection on top, which are inserted in the<br>
Channel Track and a bend of 35 to 45 degrees at bottom. A hole is provided at<br>
bottom of the bend for holding the hook-carrying curtain.<br>
Required number of Spacers are inserted into the channel track behind the Left<br>
and Right Carriers and the hooks-carrying curtain are inserted in these holes<br>
Figure 5        shows the design of End Bracket (Left and Right).<br>
These Brackets are "L" shaped, provided with two rivet holes and another fold at<br>
top. The top fold is provided with holes for nailing the Bracket to the ceiling,<br>
Figure 6        shows the design of Wheel.<br>
The wheel of 20 mm diameter and 10 mm thickness is provided with a groove of<br>
3.5 mm radius for seating rope and a hole at the center for inserting rivet on which<br>
it rolls. Two wheels are fitted on each End Bracket (i.e. on Left and Right End<br>
Brackets).<br>
Figure 7        shows the design of Rear Support Plate.<br>
This is an "L" shaped Plate provided with two rivet holes made suitably for fitting on Left and Right End Brackets. Two wheels (Fig.6) are placed between End Bracket (Fig.5) and Rear Support Plate (Fig.7) and fastened with rivet through the holes provided in End Bracket, Wheel and Rear Support Plate for the purpose.<br><br>
Thus, the End Bracket Assembly is completed. These End Bracket Assemblies are fitted on left and right ends of the Channel (Fig.l) when a complete Dual Mode Curtain Swinger gets formed.<br>
Figure I	show the order of tying the rope through the Wheels.<br>
One end of a rope (Rl) is inserted in Right End Bracket Assembly, drawn through top wheel and tied to Right Carrier ('A').   The other end will be hanging down. One end of another rope (R2) is inserted in Right End Bracket Assembly between the wheels, drawn through the Left Carrier ('B'), inserted in between the wheels of Left End Bracket Assembly, drawn through top wheel of the Left End Bracket Assembly and tied to Right Carrier ('A').   The other end will be hanging down. Pulling the hanging end of first rope (Rl) draws the Carriers back and the Curtain gets opened. Pulling the hanging end of second rope (R2) draws the Carriers closer and the Curtain gets closed.<br>
Figure 8        shows the design of Adjustable Plate.<br>
This plate is provided with two flaps folded inwardly and a rivet hole. While one end of the End Bracket Assembly is fitted in the Channel the other end of the same is inserted in between these flaps.<br>
Figure 9	shows the design of Wall Mounting Bracket.<br>
This is an 'L' shaped plate provided with folds on top and bottom (for inserting<br>
the Adjustable Plate - Fig. 8) and holes for nailing to the wall.<br>
Two Wall Mounting Brackets are nailed to the wall at required distance on left and<br>
right side and the Adjustable Plate (Fig.8) is fasten^ to these Brackets.<br><br>
Figure 10      shows the design of Center Support Plate. These Plates are nailed to the Wall at every two feet distance between Left and Right Wall Mounting Brackets for supporting and bearing the load of lengthier Curtain Rods.<br>
Figure II        shows the method in which the Dual Mode Curtain Swinger is erected on the Wall Mounting Brackets.<br>
The Wall Mounting Bracket is nailed to wall on left and right sides and Adjustable Plate is fastened to it. The respective Left and Right End Brackets of Dual Mode Curtain Swinger are inserted in between the flaps provided on Adjustable Plates. Thus, the curtain rod can be fitted to and removed from the flaps without disturbing Wall Mounted Brackets and Adjustable Plates.<br>
Figure 11       shows the design of Hanger Hooks.<br>
Using three wires of different lengths in which two wires are bent in "U" shape and one wire bent in "V" shape (on top end) these Hooks are formed. The smaller "U" shaped wire is placed in larger one in a way their ends are evenly arranged (as shown in figure 11) and are held firmly in that position by welding one end of the "V" shaped wire on them.<br>
Figure 11A   shows the design of Nylon/Cotton Strip stitched on to the curtain. A strip of around 3-4 inches width is provided with holes (of 3 or 4 mm diameter) at an interval of 1 Inch on the strip (as shown in figure 11 A).   The prongs of Hooks (Figure 11) are inserted in these holes (as shown in figure 12) thus the frills are formed on curtain. Figure III      shows front view of Dual Mode Curtain Swinger as erected on wall.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
