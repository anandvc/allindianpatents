				<td>COMPOSITIONS CONTAINING LEGUME PRODUCTS<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to legume products,<br>
topical compositions containing such legume products, and<br>
the manufacture and use thereof.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Legume fruits contain high levels of proteins,<br>
lipids and carbohydrates. Consequently, legume fruits,<br>
such as soybeans, and compositions containing legume<br>
fruits are considered a great nutrient for human use.<br>
Legume fruits also contain compounds that inhibit<br>
protease activity. For example, two protein protease<br>
inhibitors were isolated from soybeans in the early<br>
1940's, the Kunitz-type trypsin inhibitor (soybean<br>
trypsin inhibitor, STI) and the Bowman-Birk protease<br>
inhibitor (BBT) . See, e.g., Birk, Int. J. Pept. Protein<br>
Res. 25:113-131 (1985) and Kennedy, Am. J. Clin. Neutr.<br>
68:1406S-1412S (1998).<br>
STI inhibits the proteolytic activity of trypsin by<br>
the formation of a stable stoichiometric complex. See,<br>
e.g., Liu, K., Chemistry and Nutritional value of<br>
soybean components. In: Soybeans, chemistry, technology<br>
and utilization, pp. 32-35 (Aspen publishers, Inc.,<br>
Gaithersburg, MD, 1999). STI consists of 181 amino acid<br>
residues with two disulfide bridges and is roughly<br>
spherically shaped. See, e.g., Song et al., J. Mol.<br>
Biol. 275:347-63 (1998).<br>
BBI is an 8 k-Da protein that inhibits the<br>
proteases trypsin and chymotrypsin at separate reactive<br>
sites. See, e.g., Billings et al., Pro. Natl. Acad.<br>
Sci. 89:3120-3124 (1992). STI and BBI are found only<br>
in the soybean seed, and not in any other part of the<br>
plant. See, e.g., Birk, Int. J. Pept. Protein Res.<br>
25:113-131 (1985) .<br>
However, due to its natural origin, high levels of<br>
microorganisms are carried on the outside of legume<br>
fruits, such as soybeans. Consequently, decontamination<br>
processes such as heat, organic/aqueous solvent<br>
extraction, and high shear purification may be used to<br>
reduce such microorganism concentrations to allow it to<br>
be safe for human use, e.g., skin care applications.<br>
Applicants, however, have found that these processes,<br>
which frequently denature the active compounds in the<br>
soy, result in a compromised biological efficacy (e.g.,<br>
a reduction in protease inhibitory activity) which is<br>
important for cosmetic and therapeutic uses to the skin,<br>
hair, and nails. Furthermore, such processes also can<br>
lead to instability of the soy product as well as to an<br>
undesirable odor and color generation. Therefore, there<br>
is a commercial need to develop a means to reduce the<br>
levels of microbials in soy products without<br>
compromising the biological benefits of such products.<br>
The object of the present invention is to provide<br>
for a soy product (e.g., that can be used as an<br>
ingredient in a skin, hair, or nail care composition)<br>
that has reaucea microbial content but maintains its<br>
protease inhibitory activity. Another object of the<br>
invention is to provided for a skin, hair, or nail care<br>
composition containing such soy product optionally with<br>
other active agents.<br>
The present invention relates to legume products<br>
containing reduced microbial content that retains<br>
legume's beneficial biological activities, processes for<br>
obtaining such legume products, and uses thereof in<br>
cosmetic compositions.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention features legume products<br>
having trypsin inhibitory activity and reduced microbial<br>
content, methods of decontaminating such soy products,<br>
and compositions containing such soy products. In one<br>
preferred embodiment, the legume product is a soy<br>
product.<br>
The present invention also relates to the topical<br>
application of legume products or compositions containing<br>
such legume products for use in the maintenance of<br>
healthy skin, nails, and hair as well as the prevention<br>
or the treatment of skin, nails, and hair disorders,<br>
including, but not limited to: regulating firmness of the<br>
skin, hair, or nails; cleansing the skin, hair or nails;<br>
reducing and/or delaying hair or nail growth;<br>
straightening and /or lightening of hair; treatment<br>
and/or prevention of acne; regulating the tone of skin,<br>
hair, or nails; regulating the texture of skin, hair, or<br>
nails; regulating wrinkles in skin; treatment of external<br>
aggressions in skin, hair, or nails; and beautifying the<br>
skin, hair, or nails.<br>
Other features and advantages of the present<br>
invention will be apparent from the detailed description<br>
of the invention and from the claims<br>

particular condition being treated, the age and physical<br>
condition of the end user, the severity of the condition<br>
being treated/prevented, the duration of the treatment,<br>
the nature of other treatments, the specific compound or<br>
product/composition employed, the particular<br>
cosmetically-acceptable carrier utilized, and like<br>
factors.<br>
Legume Product<br>
What is meant by a "legume product" is a substance<br>
derived from a legume fruit. A legume is a plant from the<br>
family Leguminosae, which has a dehiscent fruit such as a<br>
bean, pea, or lentil. Examples of legumes, include but are<br>
not limited to, beans such as soybeans, lentil beans, peas,<br>
and peanuts.<br>
The legume product may contain the entire legume<br>
fruit (e.g., the legume fruit ground into a powder) or<br>
only a portion of the legume (e.g., an extract of the<br>
legume). The legume product may be in the form of a<br>
fluid (e.g., a mixture of the legume fruit and water) or<br>
a solid (e.g., legume fruits powders). When in the form<br>
of a fluid, the term "legume product" refers to the solid<br>
constituents of the fluid derived from the legume.<br>
The compositions of the present invention comprise a<br>
safe ,and effective amount of the legume product (e.g.,<br>
soy product). In one embodiment, the composition<br>
contains from about 0.001% to about 50%, from about 1% to<br>
about 30%, of the legume product (e.g., soy product).<br>
Soy Product<br>
What is meant by a "Soy Product" is a substance<br>
derived from the soybean. The soy product may contain<br>
only a portion of the soybean (e.g., an extract of the<br>
soybean such as a lipid reduced soybean powder or<br>
filtered soymilk) or may contain the entire soybean<br>
(e.g., a ground powder of the legume). The soy product<br>
may be in the form of a fluid (e.g., soymilk) or a solid<br>
(e.g., a soybean powder or soymilk powder). When in the<br>
form of a fluid, the term "soy product" refers to the<br>
solid constituents of the fluid that are derived from the<br>
soybean.<br>
In one embodiment, the soy product is soybean<br>
powder. Soybean powder may be made by grinding dry<br>
soybeans. In one embodiment, the soybean powder has a<br>
average particle size of less than about 10 micrometers<br>
such as less than about 1 micrometer. In one embodiment,<br>
the soybean powder has a moisture content of less than<br>
about 10% such as less than about 5%. In one embodiment,<br>
the soybean powder is lyophilized.<br>
In one embodiment, the soy product is soymilk or<br>
soymilk powder. Soymilk is a combination of solids<br>
derived from soybeans and water, the mixture of which has<br>
some or all of the insoluble constituents filtered off.<br>
Soymilk powder is evaporated soymilk, which in one<br>
embodiment, is in a lyophilized or spray-dried form.<br>
Procedures for manufacturing soymilk include, but are not<br>
limited to, the following three procedures. First,<br>
soymilk may be made by placing soybeans into wate to<br>
allow them to absorb the water. The swelled beans are<br>
then ground and additional water is then added. The<br>
mixture may then filtered to remove any insoluble<br>
residue. Second, soymilk may also be prepared from<br>
soybean powder. Soybean powder is thoroughly mixed with<br>
water (e.g., for at least one hour), which may then be<br>
followed by a filtration process to remove insoluble<br>
residues. Third, soymilk can also be reconstituted from<br>
soymilk powder by adding water. In one embodiment,<br>
soymilk comprises from between about 1% to about 5 0%, by<br>
weight (e.g., from about 5% to about 20%, by weight) of<br>
solids from the soybean.<br>
Anti-microbial Treatment of Legume Product<br>
As discussed above, the surface of legume fruits<br>
often contain high levels of microorganisms. Thus,<br>
prior to use by humans, the legume product needs to be<br>
treated to reduce or eliminate such microorganisms.<br>
In one embodiment, the legume products of the<br>
present invention have a total microbial content of less<br>
than about 10,000 colony-forming units ("cfu") per gram.<br>
In a further embodiment, the soy products of the present<br>
invention have a microbial content of less than about<br>
1,000 cfu per gram (such as less than about 100 cfu per<br>
gram) of the legume product.<br>
In one embodiment, the legume products of the<br>
present invention have a total objectionable microbial<br>
content of less than 3 00 cfu per gram such as less than<br>
15 0 cfu per gram. In a further embodiment, the legume<br>
products of the present invention have an undetectable<br>
amount of any objectionable microbials for at least one<br>
gram (e.g., at least ten grams) of legume product.<br>
In one embodiment, the legume product is exposed to<br>
gamma irradiation. In a further embodiment, the legume<br>
product is exposed to between about 2 to about 3 0 kGy of<br>
gamma irradiation, such as between about 5 and about 10<br>
kGy of gamma irradiation. Applicants have unexpectedly<br>
found that such treatment reduces the microbial content<br>
of the legume product, while maintaining its biological<br>
activity (e.g., serine protease inhibitory activity).<br>
Applicants have also found that treatment of legume<br>
products with gamma irradiation maintains the cosmetic<br>
elegance of the legume product, such as maintained its<br>
natural colors and did not induce significant malodors.<br>
Other anti-microbial processes that also maintain<br>
the protease inhibitory activity of the legume product<br>
that can be practiced alone or in combination with gamma<br>
irradiation, include, but are not limited to, exposure to<br>
x-rays, high energy electron or proton beams, ultraviolet<br>
radiation, hydrostatic pressure, and addition of chemical<br>
agents possessing antimicrobial activity, and<br>
combinations thereof. A complete list of methods for<br>
microbial content reduction is set forth in<br>
"Disinfection, sterilization, and preservation" 4th<br>
edition, Seymour S. Block, pp. 887-888 (1991, Lea &amp;<br>
Febiger, Malvern, PA).<br>
Applicants have found that processes using thermal<br>
treatment may result in a substantial loss in protease<br>
inhibitory activity and, thus, should be used with<br>
caution. For example, applicants have found that<br>
heating soymilk to 100°C for only 10 minutes reduced the<br>
trypsin inhibitory activity of the soymilk from 86%<br>
(when maintained at 4°C) to 4 6%. Applicants have found<br>
that heating soymilk can also result in a change of the<br>
color or odor of the soybean product.<br>
Topical Compositions<br>
The topical compositions useful in the present<br>
invention involve formulations suitable for topical<br>
application to skin. In one embodiment, the composition<br>
comprises the soy product and a cosmetically-acceptable<br>
topical carrier. In one embodiment, the cosmetically-<br>
acceptable topical carrier is from about 50% to abut<br>
99.99%, by weight, of the composition (e.g., from about<br>
80% to about 95%, by weight, of the composition.<br>
The compositions may be made into a wide variety of<br>
product types that include but are not limited to<br>
lotions, creams, gels, sticks, sprays, shaving creams,<br>
ointments, cleansing liquid washes and solid bars,<br>
shampoos, pastes, powders, mousses, shaving creams,<br>
wipes, patches, nail lacquers, wound dressing and<br>
adhesive bandages, hydrogels, films and make-up such as<br>
foundations, mascaras, and lipsticks. These product<br>
types may comprise several types of cosmetically<br>
acceptable topical carriers including, but not limited<br>
to solutions, emulsions (e.g., microemulsions and<br>
nanoemulsions), gels, solids and liposomes. The<br>
following are non-limitative examples of such carriers.<br>
Other carriers can be formulated by those of ordinary<br>
skill in the art.<br>
The topical compositions useful in the present<br>
invention can be formulated as solutions. Solutions<br>
typically include an aqueous solvent (e.g., from about<br>
50% to about 99.99% or from about 90% to about 99% of a<br>
cosmetically acceptable aqueous solvent).<br>
Topical compositions useful in the subject<br>
invention may be formulated as a solution comprising an<br>
emollient. Such compositions preferably contain from<br>
about 2% to about 50% of an emollient(s). As used<br>
herein, "emollients" refer to materials used for the<br>
prevention or relief of dryness, as well as for the<br>
protection of the skin. A wide variety of suitable<br>
emollients are known and may be used herein. Sagarin,<br>
Cosmetics, Science and Technology, 2nd Edition, Vol. 1,<br>
pp. 32-43 (1972) and the International Cosmetic<br>
Ingredient Dictionary and Handbook, eds. Wenninger and<br>
McEwen, pp. 1656-61, 1626, and 1654-55 (The Cosmetic,<br>
Toiletry, and Fragrance Assoc, Washington, D.C., 7th<br>
Edition, 1997) (hereinafter "ICI Handbook") contains<br>
numerous examples of suitable materials.<br>
A lotion can be made from such a solution. Lotions<br>
typically comprise from about 1% to about 20% (e.g.,<br>
from about 5% to about 10%) of an emollient(s) and from<br>
about 50% to about 90% (e.g., from about 60% to about<br>
80%) of water.<br>
Another type of product that may be formulated from<br>
a solution is a cream. A cream typically comprises from<br>
about 5% to about 50% (e.g., from about 10% to about<br>
20%) of an emollient(s) and from about 45% to about 85%<br>
(e.g., from about 50% to about 75%) of water.<br>
Yet another type of product that may be formulated<br>
from a solution is an ointment. An ointment may<br>
comprise a simple base of animal or vegetable oils or<br>
semi-solid hydrocarbons. An ointment may comprise from<br>
about 2% to about 10% of an emollient(s) plus from about<br>
0.1% to about 2% of a thickening agent(s). A more<br>
complete disclosure of thickening agents or viscosity<br>
increasing agents useful herein can be found in Sagarin,<br>
Cosmetics, Science and Technology, 2nd Edition, Vol. 1,<br>
pp. 72-73 (1972) and the ICI Handbook pp. 1693-1697.<br>
The topical compositions useful in the present<br>
invention formulated as emulsions. If the carrier is an<br>
emulsion, from about 1% to about 10% (e.g., from about<br>
2% to about 5%) of the carrier comprises an<br>
emulsifier(s). Emulsifiers may be nonionic, anionic or<br>
cationic. Suitable emulsifiers are disclosed in, for<br>
example, U.S. Patent No. 3,755,560, U.S. Patent No.<br>
4,421,769, McCutcheon's Detergents and Emulsifiers,<br>
North American Edition, pp. 317-324 (1986), and the ICI<br>
Handbook, pp.1673-1686.<br>
Lotions and creams can be formulated as emulsions.<br>
Typically such lotions comprise from 0.5% to about 5% of<br>
an emulsifier(s). Such creams would typically comprise<br>
from about 1% to about 20% (e.g., from about 5% to about<br>
10%) of an emollient(s); from about 20% to about 80%<br>
(e.g., from 30% to about 70%) of water; and from about<br>
1% to about 10% (e.g., from about 2% to about 5%) of an<br>
emulsifier (s ) .<br>
Single emulsion skin care preparations, such as<br>
lotions and creams, of the oil-in-water type and water-<br>
in-oil type are well-known in the cosmetic art and are<br>
useful in the subject invention. Multiphase emulsion<br>
compositions, such as the water-in-oil-in-water type, as<br>
disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,254,105 and 4,960,764,<br>
are also useful in the subject invention. In general,<br>
such single or multiphase emulsions contain water,<br>
emollients, and emulsifiers as essential ingredients.<br>
The topical compositions of this invention can also<br>
be formulated as a gel (e.g., an aqueous gel using a<br>
suitable gelling agent(s)). Suitable gelling agents for<br>
aqueous gels include, but are not limited to, natural<br>
gums, acrylic acid and acrylate polymers and copolymers,<br>
and cellulose derivatives (e.g., hydroxymethyl cellulose<br>
and hydroxypropyl cellulose). Suitable gelling agents<br>
for oils (such as mineral oil) include, but are not<br>
limited to, hydrogenated butylene/ethylene/styrene<br>
copolymer and hydrogenated ethylene/propylene/styrene<br>
copolymer. Such gels typically comprises between about<br>
0.1% and 5%, by weight, of such gelling agents.<br>
The topical compositions of the present invention<br>
can also be formulated into a solid formulation (e.g., a<br>
wax-based stick, soap bar composition, powder, or a wipe<br>
containing powder).<br>
Liposomal formulations are also useful compositions<br>
of the subject invention. Examples of liposomes are<br>
unilamellar, multilamellar, and paucilamellar liposomes,<br>
which may or may not contain phospholipids. Such<br>
compositions can be prepared by first combining<br>
hesperetin with a phospholipid, such as<br>
dipalmitoylphosphatidyl choline, cholesterol and water<br>
according to the method described in Mezei &amp;<br>
Gulasekharam, "Liposomes--A Selective Drug Delivery<br>
System for the Topical Route of Administration; Gel<br>
Dosage Form", Journal of Pharmaceutics and Pharmacology,<br>
Vol. 34 (1982), pp. 473-474, or a modification thereof.<br>
Epidermal lipids of suitable composition for forming<br>
liposomes may be substituted for the phospholipid. The<br>
liposome preparation may then incorporated into one of<br>
the above carriers (e.g., a gel or an oil-in-water<br>
emulsion) in order to produce the liposomal formulation.<br>
Other compositions and pharmaceutical uses of topically<br>
applied liposomes are described in Mezei, M., "Liposomes<br>
as a Skin Drug Delivery System", Topics in<br>
Pharmaceutical Sciences (D. D. Breimer and P. Speiser,<br>
eds.,), Elsevier Science Publishers B. V., New York,<br>
N.Y., 1985, pp. 345-358, PCT Patent Application No.<br>
WO96/31194 and U.S. Patent No. 5,260,065.<br>
The topical compositions useful in the subject<br>
invention may contain, in addition to the aforementioned<br>
components, a wide variety of additional oil-soluble<br>
materials and/or water-soluble materials conventionally<br>
used in compositions for use on skin, hair, and nails at<br>
their art-established levels.<br>

Examples of such natural extracts include grape seed,<br>
green tea, pine bark, and propolis. Other examples of<br>
antioxidants may be found on pages 1612-13 of the ICI<br>
Handbook.<br>
Other Materials<br>
Various other materials may also be present in the<br>
compositions useful in the subject invention. These<br>
include humectants, proteins and polypeptides,<br>
preservatives and an alkaline agent. Examples of such<br>
agents are disclosed in the ICI Handbook, pp.1650-1667.<br>
The compositions of the present invention may also<br>

dioxide), pigments, and fragrances.<br>
Mineral Water<br>
The legume product (e.g., soymilk) and compositions<br>
of the present invention may be prepared using a mineral<br>
water. In one embodiment, the mineral water has a<br>
mineralization of at least about 200 mg/L (e.g., from<br>
about 300 mg/L to about 1000 mg/L). In one embodiment,<br>
the mineral water comprises at least about 10 mg/L of<br>
calcium and/or at least about 5 mg/L of magnesium.<br>
The composition and formulations containing such<br>
compositions of the present invention may be prepared<br>
using methodology that is well known by an artisan of<br>
ordinary skill.<br>
Example 1: Gamma Irradiation of Legume Product<br>
Applicants have found that soymilk powder prior to<br>
any antimicrobial processing such as gamma irradiation<br>
has high levels microbiai content, ranging from up to<br>
50,000 cfu per gram. Such products were also found to<br>
have detectable levels of objectionable microbiai<br>
content, such as fecal streptococci, at levels up to<br>
2 0,00 0 cfu per gram.<br>
Applicants have exposed various amounts (e.g., from<br>
about 1 g to about 200 kg) of soymilk powder to gamma<br>
irradiation varying from 1 kGy to 16 kGy. The dose or<br>
gamma irradiation needed for a reduction a total<br>
microbial content to less than about 100 cfu per gram<br>
was found to be about 10 kGy. The dose for one log<br>
reduction for fecal streptococci is determined to be<br>
about 3 kGy and a dose of about 5 kGy was found to<br>
consistently reduce this microbial content within a 10<br>
gram sample of soymilk powder to undetectable levels.<br>
However, the amount of gamma irradiation used on the<br>
legume product will ultimately be determined by the<br>
microbial content and size of the soy product to be so<br>
treated.<br>
Example 2: Trypsin Inhibitory Activity of Legume Product<br>
The inhibition of trypsin-induced cleavage of a<br>
fluorescent casein peptide was measured using the<br>
EnzChek™ protease assay kit, following manufacturer's<br>
instructions (EnzChek™ Protease Assay Kits Product<br>
Information, Revised 3/15/99; Molecular Probes, Eugene<br>
OR). In summary, various soy preparations were first<br>
diluted in 1X digestion buffer (provided in kit) and<br>
incubated at different concentrations with 1000 units of<br>
trypsin (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) dissolved in 1X digestion<br>
buffer. A pure serine protease inhibitor (soybean<br>
trypsin inhibitor, from Sigma, St. Louis, MO) was used as<br>
a positive control at 0.1, 0.01%, and 0.001% w/v. Then,<br>
1.0 mg/ml stock solution of BODIPY FL casein was prepared<br>
by adding 0.2 mL of deionized water to the vials supplied<br>
with this substrate (provided in kit), then made to a<br>
final working concentration of 10 microgram/ml in<br>
digestion buffer. Following incubation of the trypsin,<br>
with or without the test material, with the BODIPY<br>
fluorescent casein substrate at room temperature for one<br>
hour, fluorescence was measured (excitation 485 nm<br>
/emission 53 0 nm) on a SpectraMax® Gemini microtiter<br>
plate reader (Molecular Devices Corporation, Sunnyvale,<br>
CA) using Softmax® Pro 3.0 software (Molecular Devices<br>
Corporation). Each experiment was performed in three<br>
replicates and was repeated twice.<br>
This assay was performed on soy products processed<br>
seven different ways. Example A was soybeans ground<br>
into powder (Sunlight Foods Corporation, Taipei County,<br>
Taiwan, R.O.C.). Example B was soybean powder of<br>
Example A exposed to about 8-15 kGy of gamma<br>
irradiation. Example C was soybean powder in which the<br>
oil in the soybean powder was removed by extraction<br>
(Soyafluff® 200W from Central Soya Company, Inc., Fort<br>
Weyne, IN). Example D was, soymilk powder made with<br>
dehulled soybeans and water that was subsequently<br>
filtered and heated and spray dried (Devansoy Farms,<br>
Carroll, Iowa) and exposed to between about 7-9 kGy of<br>
gamma irradiation. Example E was soymilk powder obtained<br>
by mixing soy beans and water, heating the mixture<br>
overnight, and adding 1,3-butylene glycol to the mixture<br>
(Flavosterone SB from Ichimaru Pharcos Co., Ltd, Gifu<br>
Japan). Example F was soymilk powder obtained by mixing<br>
soy beans and water, heating the mixture overnight, and<br>
subsequently adding ethanol to the mixture (Flavosterone<br>
SE from Ichimaru Pharcos Co., Ltd, Gifu Japan). Example<br>
G was an extract of soy proteins (Vegeseryl HGP LS 8572<br>
from Laboratories Serobiologiques S.A., Pulnoy, France).<br>
These soy products were compared to Soy Trypsin<br>
Inhibitor (STI) (Sigma).<br>
The percent inhibition of trypsin cleavage of the<br>
substrate by the different soy preparations was<br>
calculated using Microsoft Excel™ and is reported in<br>
Table 1.<br>
Table 1<br>
Tested Product	Concentration	% Inhibition of Trypsin<br>
STI	0.01	43.0<br>
STI	0.1	7 6.1<br>
Example A	0.01	32.8<br>
Example A	0.1	67.1<br>
Examp1e B	0.01	31.5<br>
Example B	0.1	67.2<br>
Example C	0.01	22.7<br>
Example C	0.1	3 6.2<br>
Example D	0.01	8.92<br>
Example D	0.1	17.4<br>
Example E	0.01	7.83<br>
Example E	0.1	10.8<br>
Example F	0.01	4.87<br>
Example F	0.1	5.9 9<br>
Example G	0.1	6.85<br>
As shown in Table 1, STI can inhibit trypsin-induced<br>
cleavage in a dose response manner. Example A, which is<br>
soybean powder, also significantly inhibited trypsin<br>
activity. Further gamma irradiation of the soybean<br>
powder (i.e., Example B), while reducing the microbial<br>
content of the soybean powder, unexpectedly did not<br>
significantly impact the trypsin inhibition activity of<br>
the soybean powder. The heat and/or extraction<br>
processing of Examples C-G, however, did significantly<br>
reduce the trypsin inhibitory activity of the soybean<br>
powder.<br>
Example 3: Thiol Retention Activity of Legume Product<br>
The ability of soy powder to prevent smoke-induced<br>
loss of thiols was evaluated in normal human dermal<br>
fibroblasts (Clonetics, San Diego, CA). Thiols, chiefly<br>
glutathione, are part of the endogenous cellular<br>
antioxidant defense system. Glutathione serves as a<br>
redox buffer, thereby, maintaining the balance between<br>
oxidants and antioxidants. Glutathione is also the<br>
preferred substrate for several enzymes such as the<br>
glutathione peroxidases (decomposing peroxides) and the<br>
glutathione-S-transferases (a major group of<br>
detoxification enzymes). See, A. Meister, Cancer Res.<br>
54:1969s-1975s (1994).<br>
Cutaneous antioxidants (both enzymatic and non-<br>
enzymatic) , including glutathione, are depleted after UV<br>
or ozone exposure. See, M. J. Connor and L. A. Wheeler,<br>
Photochem. Photobiol. 46:239-246 (1987) and R. M. Tyrrell<br>
and M. Pidoux, Photochem. Photobiol. 47:405-412 (1988).<br>
In cell culture models, low intracellular glutathione<br>
(GSH) levels lead to a higher UV radiation sensitivity.<br>
Topical application of cysteine derivatives on rat skin<br>
has been shown to protect against UV radiation-induced<br>
photodamage; this benefit was correlated with an increase<br>
in GSH synthesis. See, L. T. van den Broeke and G. M. J.<br>
Beijersbergen van Henegouwen, J. Photochem. Photobiol. B<br>
Biol. 27:61-65 (1995); K. Hanada, et al., J. Invest.<br>
Dermatol. 108:727-730 (1997); and D. P. T. Steenvoorden,<br>
et al., Photochem Photobiol. 67:651-656 (1998).<br>
Consequently, glucothione is a major endogenous<br>
antioxidant, highly responsive against environmental<br>
challenges, able to regulate the tone and the wrinkling<br>
of skin, as well as treat external aggression.<br>
In this experiment, normal human neonatal dermal<br>
fibroblasts seeded in 24-well format Transwell inserts<br>
(Corning Costar, Cambridge, MA) were incubated with<br>
media containing various concentrations of soymilk<br>
powder (gamma irradiated at about 5 kGy) for 2 4 hours<br>
prior to exposure with either placebo (mock) or<br>
cigarette smoke (1 cigarette, BASIC Full Flavor 100's<br>
cigarettes, Philip Morris, Richmond, VA) for 10 minutes.<br>
Prior to smoke exposure, the medium above the inserts<br>
containing the soy product was removed, and the cells<br>
were washed 3 times with Dulbecco's Phosphate-Buffered<br>
Saline (Life Technologies, Gaithersburg, MD) before<br>
being smoke-exposed with only media below the inserts.<br>
Immediately after exposure, the cells were incubated for<br>
another 24-hour period with the previous medium. The<br>
cells were washed again, 5 times with Dulbecco's<br>
Phosphate-Buffered Saline, and intracellular thiols were<br>
then measured by adding 60 mM monobromobimane (Molecular<br>
Probes, Eugene, OR, USA) to the cells and incubating at<br>
37°C for 30 minutes before the fluorescence reading. In<br>
the presence of thiols, the monobromobimane becomes<br>
fluorescent. This fluorescence was measured using a<br>
CytoFluor® Fluorescence Plate Reader (PerSeptive<br>
Biosystems, Framingham, MA, USA) set with the following<br>
filter combination: excitation at 360nm and emission at<br>
460nm.<br>
The results of this experiment are set-forth in<br>
Table 2.<br>
Table 2<br>
	Soymilk Powder	Thiols (Percent<br>
	concentration	of Thiols<br>
	(weight %)	contained in No<br>
		Smoke Group;<br>
		Mean ± S.E.M.)<br>
No Smoke	0	100 ± 6.71<br>
Smoke (10 min.)	0	65.38 ± 7.16<br>
	0.5	91.24 ± 14.25<br>
	1	95.39 ± 4.52<br>
	2	106.92 ± 17.06<br>
These results indicate that gamma irradiated soymilk<br>
powder surprisingly afforded a protection against smoke-<br>
induced loss of thiols (data represent the mean ±<br>
Standard of the mean of replicates from 3 independent<br>
experiments).<br>
