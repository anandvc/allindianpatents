				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present  invention  relates to  an  improved industrial gas burner and may advantageously be employed for  various applications such as  industrial  furnaces, air heaters and soaking pits. PRIOR ART<br>
Both, indigenous and imported gas burners are known<br>
in the art, which may either be a nozzle mix burner or a premix burner. A nozzle mix known in the art comprises a -flow pipe disposed within an outer housing and in a spaced relationship thereto so as to define first and second flow passages. Air flows into the flow pipe, whereas gas flows into a first flow passage and air into a second flow passage, a swirler provided at the discharge and of said flow pipe and said first and second flow passages so as to allow a homogeneous mix of the gas with air .<br>
The imported gas burners are attended with the disadvantages of high cost and intricate designs but have good efficiency. The main disadvantages of present indigenous gas burners are that they are inefficeint, unsafe, unreliable and have poor control and turn down.<br>
OBJECT OF THE INVENTION<br>
The main object of the present invention is to propose art improved construction of a premx industrial gas burner which obviate the aforesaid disadvantages.<br>
Another object, of the present invention is to propose an improved construction of a premix burner having improved efficiency.<br>
, Still another object of the present invention is to propose an improved construction of a premix burner which provides a conservation of gaseous fuels.<br>
Still object of the present invention is to propose an improved construction of a premix burner having controlled chimney exhaust emission released to atmosphere.<br>
Yet object of the present invention is to propose art improved construction of a premix burner which is comparitively cheap in operating costs in comparison to the advantages ensuing therefrom. DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION<br>
According to this invention there is provided an improved industrial gas burner comparison gas -feed pipe having an inlet and disposed in a spaced relation<br>
within a mixer pipe and such as to de-fine a mixing zone therebetween, said gas feed pipe having a plurality of spaced openings to allow the discharge of gas into said mixing zone, said mixer pipe having a plurality of spaced openings to allow the flow of air into said mixing zone. DESCRIPTION WITH REFERENCE TO DRAWINGS<br>
Further objects and advantages of this invention will be more apparent from the ensuing description when read in conduction with accompanying drawings: Fig 1     illustrates a conventional premix  industrial gas burner of the injector type<br>
Fig 2      illustrates a conventional  premix industrial gas burner of the velocity type Fig 3     illustrates the industrial premix gas burner of the present invention<br>
Referring to Fig 1, which illustrates a premix burner of the known art comprises an inlet 20 for introduction of air at high pressure to cause induction and suction of  fuel through inlet 21.   The premix burner  of  the known construction of Fig 1. is of  the injector type.<br>
The premix burner of Fig 2 is of the velocity type and comprises a flow passage 3d with an inlet 31 -far<br>
introduction  of gas and air mixture.  A swirler  32  is provided at the discharge end of flow passage 38.<br>
Reference is now made to Fig 3 which illistretes an improved industrial gas burner of the present invention comprising an inner most gas pipe  with a gas inlet 2 and a flange 3. Inner most gas pipe 1 has a plurality of openings 4 disposed in a spaced relationship to each other. The distal end 2a of pipe 1 comprises a closed or blind end and such as to allow gas to be discharged only through openings 4. Thus, gas discharged through openings 4 form a plurality of jet streams to cause a better and more effecient mixture with air.<br>
Pipe 1 is concentrically disposed with in a mixer pipe 5 and in a spaced relationship thereto and such as to define a mixer zone 1Bs Mixer pipe 5 has also a plurality of spaced holes 7 to allow introduction of air also in the form of jet streams into mixer zone 1B. Mixer pipe 5 has a flange 6.<br>
Mixer pipe 5 is disposed within an outer pipe B<br><br>
having an air inlet 9.  Thus, air enters into outer pipe 8 through inlet 9 and is discharged into mixing zone  IB through holes 7  Outer pipe 8 has flanges 10 &amp;  11.   The flanges hold the respective members in position.<br>
As will be apparent from Fig 3, outer pipe 8 is disposed in a spaced relationship to mixer pipe 5 and such as to -form a flow passage 19. A concentric air bypass plate 12 having holes 13 is disposed at the discharge end of outer pipe 8. Bypass plate 17 allows a part of air entering flow passage 19 to flow into discharge zone 2Â® and mix with the already formed air gas mixture discharged from the outlet 21 of mixer zone 18. Alternatively, plate 17 need not have holes 13 and whereby complete air entering flow passage 19 flows in the form of jet streames into zone 1B. An air register 14 is provided in discharge zone 20, said air register having flanges 15, 16 and air slits 17 with adjustable shutters.<br>
Gas pipe  1  may  be of  any geometrical  cross section, circular, square, rectangular,  elliptical or any polygon, with same or varying cross sectional  area througout.  The same applies to mixer pipe 5 and air pipe 8.<br>
The perforations 4 in gas pipe 1 and mixer pipe may be of any geometrical cross-section with same or varying cross-sectional area along the wall thickness of the pipe, with axis perpendicular or inclined to pipe axis.<br>
The holes 13, if any, in the air bypass plate 12 may be of any geometrical cross section as stated above with same or varying cross sectional area along the wall thickness of the plate with axis perpendicular or inclined to the face of air by pass plate.<br>
Air register 14 may be of any geometrical cross-section with same or varying cross-sectional area and with any length. An adjustable shutter is provided on the wall of the air register to control induction of atmospheric air into gas air mixture.<br>
The primary function of the gas burner of the present invention is to provide intimate mixing of gaseous fuel and oxidant (air) and deliver the mixture at the burner port with desired pressure and flow rate condition. The presently available conventional gas burners do not ensure complete mixing of gas and air. In the present invention gas and air are passed through a plurality of small perforations resulting in narrow streams of fluids which later on get thoroughly mixed together in the mixer pipe.<br>
V   W   V<br>
The main advantages of the present invention aret<br>
1.	Simple and robust, design<br>
2.	No intricate parts used.<br><br>
3.	A unique method of mixing of gas and  air  being<br>
employed<br>
4.	Low excess air requirement leading to  high<br>
flame/furnace temperature.<br>
5.	Application suitability to variety of industries<br>
6*     Improved combust on performance leading to saving<br>
