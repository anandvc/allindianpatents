				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR MANAGING ANIMATION DATA OF<br>
AN INTERACTIVE DISC<br>
1.	TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates generally to a method and apparatus for managing animation data of an interactive optical disc, and more particularly to a method and apparatus for managing animation data for use in enhanced navigation mediums, such as an interactive optical disc (for example, IDVD (Interactive Digital Versatile Disc or Enhanced Digital Versatile Disc - eDVD)) in such a way that it can reproduce various animation data associated with audio/video (A/V) data.<br>
2.	BACKGROUND ART<br>
High-density optical discs (e.g., DVDs) are capable of recording and storing digital data. The DVDs are high-capacity recording mediums capable of permanently recording and storing not only high-quality digital audio data, but also high-quality moving picture data.<br>
A DVD includes a data stream recording area for recording (1) digital data streams such as moving picture data and (2) navigation data recording area for recording navigation data needed for controlling playback of the moving picture data.<br>
Thus, a general DVD player first reads the navigation data recorded on the navigation data recording area if the DVD is seated in the player, stores the read navigation data in a memory provided in the player, and reproduces the moving picture data<br><br>
recorded on the data stream recording area using the navigation data. The DVD player reproduces the moving picture data recorded on the DVD, such that a user can see and hear a movie recorded en the DVD.<br>
Additional information associated with the playback of audio/video (A/V) data can be recorded on a DVD. This information may include, document-type content file (e.g., an HTML (KyperText Markup Language), a SMIL (Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language), a CSS (Cascading Style Sheet), a scripting language (i.e., ECMAScript)), a data-type content file (e.g., image data (e.g., JPEG or PNG), audio data (e.g., AC-3, MPEG audio, DTS, or SDDS), animation data (e.g., MNG)) and text/font data.<br>
Standardization of an interactive digital versatile disc (I-DVD) is ongoing. The A/V data recorded on the I-DVD is reproduced according to the user's interactive request. Where I-DVDs are commercialized, the supply of various contents, associated with. the main A/V data, through digital recording mediums will be more prevalent, resulting in greater convenience to the user.<br>
A method for receiving/reading the above-identified various contents files from a content server while simultaneously reproducing the main A/V data recorded on DVDs are being implemented.
