				<td>Field of the invention<br>
<br>
The invention relates to dialkyl carbonates of branched alcohols and i their use in cosmetic and/or pharmaceutical preparations.<br>
<br>
Prior art<br>
<br>
The consumer has a large number of requirements in the field of cosmetic preparations for skin and hair care:<br>
<br>
Apart  from  the  cleansing  and care  effects,  which  determine the intended use, value is placed on such different   parameters   as   the   highest   possible dermatological tolerability, good re-oiling properties, elegant appearance,  optimum sensorial impression and storage stability of human skin addition to a Preparations which are employed for cleansing and care and of hair as a rule comprise, in number of surface-active substances, above all oil substances and water. Oil substances/emollients which are employed are, for example, hydrocarbons, ester oils and plant and animal oils/fat a/waxes. To meet the high requirements of the market with respect to sensorial properties and optimum dermatological tolerability, novel oil substances and emulsifier mixtures are continuously being developed and tested.    <br>
<br>
Dialkyl carbonates of linear alcohols and their use in cosmetics are known from the prior art, for example WO 97/47282 describes the use of octyl methyl carbonate in cosmetics and EP 1 510 199 describes the use of distearyl carbonate in cosmetics. Di-n-octyl carbonate is obtainable as a cosmetics raw material under the trade  name  Cetiol®  CC  (Cognis  Deutschland GmbH  &amp; Co. KG).<br>
<br>
The preparation- of dialkyl carbonates is described in WO   97/47583.     The   symmetric   dialkyl   carbonates obtainable by the process described there contain e.g. 2-ethyl-l-hexyl pmethyl carbonate or 2-butyl-l-octyl methyl carbonate as by-products. A use of these compounds in cosmetics is not mentioned. EP 1 083 247 describes various short-chain branched dialkyl carbonates and [their suitability for washing metal surfaces.       <br>
<br>
The object of the present invention was to provide novel raw materials for cosmetic applications which have  an  improved  profile  with  respect  to  their sensorial properties (lightness, "non-greasy feeling on<br>
distribution, oi large number of the skin", softness, spreadability, absorption, ease of liness) and can be incorporated into a cosmetic formulations, for example as an oil substancd'/emollient or as an agent for imparting consistency.  It  should  be  possible  for  the  raw materials to be 'incorporated both into W/0 and into 0/W formulations,  and  in  particular  they  should  be compatible  with  crystalline  UV  filters,  pigments, antiperspirants,';  salts  and  silicones.  It  was  of particular interest to provide raw materials which have<br>
<br>
It a good or improved dissolving power for pigments or inorganic UV" filters.<br>
 It has been fpund,  surprisingly,  that  the dialkyl carbonates of the present invention achieve this obj ect and in particular lead to sensorially light products.<br>
<br>
Surprisingly,  the dialkyl carbonates of the present invention are suitable in particular for dissolving<br>
polar compounds,; in particular pigments or inorganic UV compounds    in preparations is filters.  An  easier  formulation  of  these  active cosmetic   and/or   pharmaceutical thus achieved.<br>

<br>
Preparation    <br>
<br>
The preparation!) of the	dialkyl carbonates is carried out by processes known	to the person skilled in the art,  for  example  by	transesterif ication  of  lower dialkyl  carbonates,  such as,  for  example,  dimethyl carbonate,  diethyl  carbonate,  dipropyl  carbonate	or dibutyl carbonate, with the corresponding alcohols	or alcohol mixtures in the presence of a catalyst,	as described, for example, in WO 97/47583. <br>
<br>
other  preparation  processes  are  described  in  M. Dierker: Lipid Technology, 2004, 16(6), p. 130-134.<br>
<br>
 Examples<br>
<br>
Example 1: Preparation of hexyldecyl methyl carbonate 1,350 g (15 mol) of dimethyl carbonate were initially introduced into'a 4 1 stirred apparatus with a dropping funnel with 14 g of sodium methylate (30 % strength in methanol) and the mixture was heated up to 80 °C. 699 g {1.5 mol) of hexyldecanol were then added dropwise over a period of 2 hours and the mixture was subsequently stirred at 80 °C for a further 9 hours. During this period, the methanol formed was distilled off from the  reaction mixture over a distillation attachment.  GC evaluation of the crude product gave a composition of: 4 % of hexyldecanol,  7 9 % of asymmetric hexyldecyl methyl carbonate and 13 % of symmetric di-hexyldecyl carbonate.      |<br>
<br>
The pH was adjusted to pH 3-4 with 14 g of H3PO4 (85 % strength) and excess dimethyl carbonate was distilled off. The sodium phosphate which had precipitated out u was  filtered off with suction and the product was i( fractionated. The reaction product, hexyldecyl methyl<br>
<br>
It carbonate,  is obtained as a colorless oil with a boiling point of! 125-125 °C under 0.4 mbar.<br>
<br>
 Example  2:   Formulations  with  hexyldecyl  methyl carbonate       <br>
