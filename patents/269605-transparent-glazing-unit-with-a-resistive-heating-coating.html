				<td>TRANSPARENT GLAZING UNIT WITH A RESISTIVE HEATING<br>
COATING<br>
The invention relates to a transparent glazing unit<br>
5  with  a  resistive  heating  coating  that  has  the<br>
characteristics of the preamble of claim 1.<br>
The invention relates more particularly to a glazing<br>
unit  whose  resistive heating  coating  is  a  coating<br>
10 placed on a substrate and having thermal insulation<br>
and/or solar protection capabilities. The glazing units<br>
incorporating this type of coating, when they are<br>
intended for equipping vehicles, make it possible in<br>
particular to reduce the air-conditioning load and/or<br>
15 reduce excessive overheating ("solar control" glazing)<br>
and/or reduce the amount of energy dissipated to the<br>
outside ("low-e" or "low-emissivity" glazing) brought<br>
about by the ever growing use of glazed surfaces in<br>
vehicle passenger compartments.<br>
20<br>
One type of multilayer known for giving substrates such<br>
properties consists of at least two metal layers, such<br>
as a silver-based layer, each being placed between two<br>
coatings  made  of  a dielectric.  This  multilayer  is<br>
25 generally obtained by a succession of deposition<br>
operations carried out using a vacuum technique, such<br>
as cathode sputtering, optionally magnetically enhanced<br>
or magnetron cathode sputtering. Two very thin metal<br>
layers, called "barrier layers" may also be provided,<br>
30 these being placed beneath, on, or to each side of each<br>
silver layer, the underlayer as a tie, nucleation<br>
and/or protection layer, for protection during an<br>
optional heat treatment subsequent to deposition, and<br>
the overlayer as a protective or "sacrificial" layer so<br>
3 5 as to prevent impairment of the silver if the oxide<br>
layer that surmounts it is deposited by sputtering in<br>
the presence of oxygen and/or if the multilayer<br>
undergoes a heat treatment subsequent to deposition.<br><br>
- 2 -<br>
In particular for vehicle windshields, there is high<br>
demand in the market for heating versions, in which the<br>
heating means must by nature be the least visible, or<br>
least obstructing for viewing, as possible.<br>
5 Consequently, there is an increasing demand for a<br>
transparent heating coating for such glazing.<br>
A general problem with heating coatings having a low<br>
light  absorption  is  their  relatively  high  surface<br>
10 resistance, which requires a high supply voltage, in<br>
any case for heated glazing of large dimensions or for<br>
long current paths, which voltage is in any case higher<br>
than the usual voltages on board vehicles. If it is<br>
desired  to  lower  the  surface  resistance,  this  is<br>
15 accompanied, in the multilayer systems known hitherto,<br>
with a reduction in visible light transmission because<br>
the conducting layers have to be thicker.<br>
For these technical reasons, glazing units heated by<br>
2 0 wires, which may be supplied without any problem by the<br>
on board voltage, are still preferably being mounted at<br>
the present time. These laminated glazing units with<br>
integrated heating fields in the form of very fine<br>
wires are, however, not accepted by all purchasers.<br>
25<br>
Patent DE 1 256 812 Bl discloses a glass pane that can<br>
be heated by a coating made of metal or a metal oxide<br>
deposited continuously on one of its surfaces. This<br>
publication aims to solve problems due to the high<br>
30 ohmic resistance of said coating, which is of the order<br>
of 200 Ω/. However, to be able to heat this coating<br>
using a relatively low voltage from two lateral<br>
busbars, narrow printed electrodes of low ohmic<br>
resistance (called "auxiliary electrodes") that extend<br>
35 from said busbars over the heating field are provided.<br>
Said auxiliary electrodes terminate only a short<br>
distance in front of the opposite busbar, and they<br>
overlap each other with an alternating polarity.<br><br>
- 3 -<br>
However, said lines, which are optically perceivable as<br>
a hatching, obstruct vision and detract from the<br>
optical appearance of the main viewing field-of the<br>
pane thus produced. It is not possible to make use of<br>
5 the optical advantage of a transparent heating coating.<br>
It is for this reason that such a pane is designed only<br>
for a rear window of automobiles.<br>
Another problem with heating coatings may arise owing<br>
10  to the fact that they are sometimes not able to be<br>
deposited uniformly over the entire surface of  the<br>
transparent glazing,  but one or more interruptions,<br>
called "communication windows",  have to be provided<br>
therein, which disturb the flow of the heating current<br>
15  and may form "hot spots" (local overheating) along the<br>
edges of this or these communication windows..  Such<br>
communication windows serve to make the coating, which<br>
by  nature  is  reflective  for  short-wave  radiation,<br>
respectively infrared radiation, locally more permeable<br>
20  to certain data streams or signals.<br>
To inject and extract the heating current in these<br>
coatings, at least one pair of electrodes (in the form<br>
of bands)  or of busbars,  which have to inject the<br>
2 5 current into the heating coating and distribute it over<br>
a wide front as uniformly as possible, is provided. In<br>
vehicle glazing, which is substantially more wide than<br>
high, the busbars are usually found along the longer<br>
edges of the glazing  (in the mounted position,  the<br>
30 upper and lower edges), so that the heating current can<br>
travel along the shortest path over the height of the<br>
glazing. At the same time, the aforementioned<br>
communication windows are most of the time located at<br>
the upper edge of the glazing and extend there over<br>
35  several centimeters of width.<br>
Document WO 00/72635 Al discloses a transparent<br>
substrate with a coating that reflects IR rays and a<br>
communication window produced locally by removal or<br><br>
- 4 -<br>
omission of the coating.<br>
Obviously, each communication window which modifies the<br>
uniformity of the coating disturbs the current flow.<br>
5 Local temperature spots ("hot spots") appear, which may<br>
result in damage to the substrate (thermal stresses)<br>
and to the coating itself. This is not only the case<br>
when the coating is defective over a large area, but<br>
also when the communication window is formed by a<br>
10 relatively large number of slots that do not<br>
communicate with one another. These also result, in the<br>
surface part in question, in an appreciable increase in<br>
the layer resistance and also give rise to the<br>
abovementioned hot spots.<br>
15<br>
The last document mentioned proposes, as a means of<br>
reducing the problematic effect of an extensive<br>
communication window, to provide, along its edge, an<br>
electrically  conducting  band  that  has  an"  ohmic<br>
20 resistance per square which is significantly lower than<br>
that of the heating layer. Said band purports to take<br>
the current around the cut. Preferably, a communication<br>
window is framed entirely by such a band. The band may<br>
be produced by printing a silver-containing conductive<br>
25 screen-printing paste and by baking it. However, it may<br>
also be applied by the deposition of an electrically<br>
conducting lacquer or by depositing a metal strip. In<br>
all cases, a conducting electrical connection of the<br>
band to the coating is of course necessary in order for<br>
30  it to operate.<br>
The band may be concealed from view by superposing an<br>
electrically nonconducting opaque masking strip, for<br>
example made of black enamel. As a general rule, such<br>
35 masking strips are made up from black-colored<br>
nonconducting material (screen-printing paste) to be<br>
baked. Infrared radiation is not reflected by this<br>
material, but absorbed.<br><br>
- 5 -<br>
Document WO 03/024155 A2 discloses transparent glazing<br>
of this type with a heating coating, in which, on the<br>
one  hand,  a  maximum  nominal  voltage  of  42 V  is<br>
indicated, which however aims also to solve the problem<br>
5  of  "hot spots"  along the edges of a communication<br>
window. In general, various voltage levels are used, a<br>
lower voltage being applied to shortened current paths<br>
(for example because of the communication window) so as<br>
to   avoid   local   overheating.   Specifically,   the<br>
10  communication window region is cut out from the heating<br>
surface  by  placing  a  separate  busbar  between  the<br>
communication window and the busbar located on the<br>
opposite side.<br>
15 Also known, from document DE 36 44 297 Al, are many<br>
examples of heating coatings for a vehicle windshield<br>
that are divided. The divisions may thus be produced by<br>
parts that are not provided with surface layers and/or<br>
by notches produced mechanically or by a laser beam.<br>
20 They are used for suitably adjusting and deflecting a<br>
current flow within the coated surface and have to<br>
ensure as uniform as possible a current density in the<br>
surfaces in question.<br>
25 Document WO 2004/032569 A2 discloses another<br>
configuration of transparent glazing with a heating<br>
coating, which also aims to achieve uniformity of the<br>
heating power in the surface by separating lines traced<br>
in the coating.<br>
30<br>
Document DE 29 36 398 Al relates to measures intended<br>
for preventing current spikes in the transition between<br>
the busbars and the coating, in transparent glazing<br>
with a heating coating.  In general,  the aim is to<br>
35 reduce the sudden difference in resistance between the<br>
coating and the busbars using materials or shapes with<br>
a higher resistance for the latter, or else with<br>
intermediate resistances. The above document indicates<br>
surface resistances of the coating of between 1 and 10<br><br>
6<br>
ohms per unit area. In one of the many embodiments<br>
described in that document, the edge of each busbar<br>
turn toward the opposite busbar is of corrugated form.<br>
The formation of sharp points turneded toward the<br>
5 heating coating must thus be avoided. This approach<br>
aims to appreciably lengthen the transition line<br>
between the busbar and the coating and consequently to<br>
reduce the current density in this transition. However,<br>
all these measures seem poorly suited to be able to<br>
10  supply the heating layer with a relatively low voltage.<br>
It is also known to provide, on the incident face of<br>
photovoltaic solar cells, grid or comb electrodes (see<br>
for example document WO 03/075351 Al) . They are often<br>
15 produced by screen printing and made up of a busbar<br>
placed along the edge of the solar cell and of a<br>
plurality of small comb teeth that extend from the<br>
busbar over the surface of the solar cell. These<br>
electrodes   allow   surface   connection   for   the<br>
20 photovoltaic voltage, which is present on both faces of<br>
the absorber, between the front comb electrode and the<br>
rear metal electrode, respectively, over its entire<br>
surface without excessively reducing the penetration of<br>
light into the absorber.<br>
25<br>
Document DE 197 02 448 Al discloses a heated mirror, on<br>
the glass substrate of which two comb-shaped conducting<br>
tracks or electrodes are placed, these being indented<br>
one in the other, with a PTC coating (i.e. one having a<br>
30 positive temperature coefficient of resistance) that<br>
covers them and fills the intermediate spaces between<br>
the comb teeth. However, that document does not<br>
consider the problem of making the heating invisible to<br>
the eye, because the conducting tracks and the heating<br>
35  layer may be placed behind the mirror layer.<br>
Document DE 198 32 228 Al discloses vehicle glazing<br>
with an electrically conducting coating that is<br>
optically transparent and used as an antenna. Purely<br><br>
- 7 -<br>
capacitive high-frequency radio signals are picked up<br>
from the antenna layer using a coupling electrode,<br>
which is made up of several fine wires connected<br>
together and placed parallel to one another at a<br>
5 certain distance apart that is large compared with<br>
their diameter, which wires extend from the edge into<br>
the viewing field of the glazing and terminate therein,<br>
without continuing. There is no galvanic coupling<br>
between the coating and these wires, because each time<br>
10 they lie in different planes from the laminated<br>
glazing.<br>
The busbars already mentioned many times may be<br>
produced on the glass pane equally well by printing<br>
15 (screen printing) before or after deposition of the<br>
coating, or by soldering thin strips of sheet metal,<br>
preferably made of tinned copper. Combinations of<br>
printed busbars and metal-strip busbars are also known<br>
(see   for   example   document   DE 198 29 151 Cl).<br>
2 0 Admittedly, the busbars are usually narrow and in the<br>
form of strips, but they are not transparent. For<br>
optical reasons, they are therefore placed each time<br>
near the outer edge of the transparent glazing units in<br>
question.  Most of the time,  they may be masked by<br>
25 opaque edge coatings (usually produced by screen<br>
printing). Likewise, the aforementioned communication<br>
windows may be masked by these edge coatings, provided<br>
that they are sufficiently permeable to the radiation<br>
to be transmitted via the communication window.<br>
30<br>
In standard vehicle windshields, these opaque coatings<br>
are in the form of a frame provided all around the<br>
glazing, which frame also has the function of<br>
protecting the bonded joint between the glazing and the<br>
35 body from UV radiation. These frames surround the<br>
general viewing field of the glazing. In windshields, a<br>
distinction may also be made between the main viewing<br>
field A, approximately in the middle of the area of the<br>
glazing,  in  which  there  can  be  no  perceptible<br><br>
8<br>
impairment of vision (for example by colorations or<br>
wires or other damage larger in size than 30 microns) ,<br>
and the secondary viewing field B closer to the edges.<br>
5 The problem at the basis of the invention therefore<br>
consists in how to provide a transparent glazing unit<br>
provided with a heating coating that can operate with<br>
relatively low nominal voltages, in particular around<br>
12  to  14 volts,  and which nevertheless  produces  a<br>
10 uniform distribution of the heating, in particular<br>
without any hot spot, with viewing in the general<br>
viewing field of the glazing, and in particular in the<br>
main viewing field A of the glazing, which is impeded<br>
as little as possible.<br>
15<br>
This problem is solved according to the invention by<br>
the features of claim 1. The features of the dependent<br>
claims provide preferred embodiments of this invention.<br>
20 According to the invention, the heating field, formed<br>
by the current flowing between the busbars when an<br>
electrical supply voltage is applied between these<br>
busbars, includes at least one semiresistive region in<br>
direct contact with at least one busbar.<br>
25<br>
The term "conducting" should be understood within the<br>
context of the present invention to mean that the<br>
element thus termed admittedly has an electrical<br>
resistance, as it is out of the question here to use<br>
30 superconductors, but that this resistance is very low,<br>
in such a way that when the electric current used flows<br>
through this element, it does not heat up so as to be<br>
perceptible by touching it with one's hand within one<br>
minute of applying voltage, that is to say that this<br>
35 element will be classed as constituting a cold region<br>
when the glazing unit is observed by thermography.<br>
The term "resistive" should be understood within the<br>
context of the present invention to mean that the<br><br>
- 9 -<br>
element thus termed has a high overall electrical<br>
resistance, in such a way that, when the electric<br>
current used passes through this element, it heats up<br>
so as to be perceptible by touching it with one's hand<br>
5 within one minute after applying voltage, that is to<br>
say that this element will be classed as constituting a<br>
hot region when the glazing unit is observed by<br>
thermography. Within the technical field in question,<br>
the resistive regions have a surface resistance of<br>
10 around 0.5 to 5 ohms per unit area and the hot regions<br>
formed at their places have power densities of at least<br>
400 to 450 watts/m2.<br>
The term "semiresistive" should be understood within<br>
15  the context of the present invention to mean that the<br>
element  thus  termed  has  a  low  overall  electrical<br>
resistance, which is less than that of the resistive<br>
element (s),  but greater than that of the conducting<br>
element(s). The expression "semiresistive region" used<br>
20  in particular here denotes an area having a low overall<br>
resistance.  However,  the  region  may  have  a  high<br>
resistance in certain places and a very low resistance<br>
in other places.  For example,  it may even  include<br>
conducting  elements  and  resistive  elements,   the<br>
2 5  combination and configuration thereof make said region<br>
"semiresistive".<br>
The heating field is the direct result of the electric<br>
field when voltage is applied to the terminals of the<br>
30 electric field. It also denotes the actual -heating<br>
region of said glazing, which extends between the two<br>
busbars.<br>
The object of the present invention is to create a<br>
35 novel heating field through the use of a particular<br>
electric field. As in the electric fields of the prior<br>
art, the ends of the electric field are formed by<br>
conducting regions embodied by the busbars, and between<br>
these busbars an electric field is produced. However,<br><br>
- 10 -<br>
unlike the prior art, the surface resistance of this<br>
field is not uniform over its entire area - a<br>
semiconducting region is produced in contact with at<br>
least one busbar. This has the effect of promoting<br>
5 electrical conduction in this region through which the<br>
current flows and has the effect as it were of favoring<br>
energy transport into the following resistive region.<br>
At least one part of the electric field according to<br>
10  the invention thus has the following scheme, from one<br>
busbar to the other:<br>
conducting region/semiconducting region/resistive<br>
region/.../conducting region.<br>
15 Thus over at least one path between two busbars, the<br>
current will firstly pass through a semiconducting<br>
region and then through a resistive region.<br>
The electric  field between the busbars  thus, has a<br>
20  resistivity gradient formed from at least two separate<br>
(semiresistive/resistive)  states. There may also be a<br>
gradual gradient formed from many states, thus passing<br>
gradually from the conducting state to the resistive<br>
state and then returning to the conducting state.<br>
25<br>
This may all be observed by thermography.<br>
The present invention is of most particular importance<br>
in the "panoramic windshield" technology.<br>
30<br>
In this technology, the aim is to produce windshields<br>
that are as wide and/or as tall as possible, which<br>
include portions extending laterally along the sides of<br>
the vehicle and/or on the roof of the vehicle.<br>
35<br>
Thanks to the invention, it is thus possible to produce<br>
heating panoramic windshields in which the heating<br>
power is concentrated in the essential part of the<br>
glazing, namely the main viewing field A.<br><br>
- 11 -<br>
With  these  features  and  arrangements,  a  relative<br>
shortening of the path of the current flow within the<br>
coating  of  relatively  high  resistance  itself  is<br>
5  obtained because part of the distance between the<br>
actual busbars and the main central heating field, in<br>
the main viewing field A, is crossed by low-resistance<br>
auxiliary conductors or else by said semiresistive<br>
regions.<br>
10<br>
The main viewing field A of the glazing preferably has<br>
no semiresistive region and thus it remains optically<br>
free of any perturbations or obstructions.<br>
15 In an alternative embodiment, at least one<br>
semiresistive region is preferably in direct contact<br>
with at least one busbar at the positive potential.<br>
At least one other semiresistive region is then<br>
20 preferably in direct contact with at least one busbar<br>
at the negative potential and the main viewing field A<br>
then preferably lies between said two at least<br>
semiresistive regions.<br>
25 In one particular version of the invention, the<br>
semiresistive region includes conducting strands formed<br>
from conducting printed lines, preferably printed on<br>
the heating coating 2 and/or from conducting wires,<br>
these conducting wires preferably being electrically <br>
3 0 connected to the heating coating and at least to said<br>
semiresistive region by soldering at least at discrete<br>
contact points.<br>
The conducting strands cover only part of the heating<br>
35  field (close to the edges of the glazing), especially a<br>
relatively wide strip along the busbars.<br>
They terminate blindly, preferably before the boundary<br>
of the central viewing field A.<br><br>
- 12 -<br>
Thus,  a semiresistive region that does not greatly<br>
impair viewing, which in any case is the aim with any<br>
semiresistive region referred to here, is used.<br>
5<br>
Unlike in document DE 1 256 812 Bl, there are no<br>
overlapping elements of opposite polarity in the region<br>
of the main viewing field and the current flows, after<br>
activating the electrical power supply, approximately<br>
10 in a direction normal to the busbars and therefore in a<br>
direction parallel to the overall longitudinal<br>
direction of the blindly terminating conducting<br>
strands. It should be understood that this "overall<br>
longitudinal direction"  is the general direction or<br>
15 extension along which said strands extend from the<br>
busbars toward the main viewing field.<br>
Furthermore, the resistance of the transition between<br>
the busbar and the coating is further reduced by<br>
20 greatly increasing the areas of contact compared with<br>
the prior art. Consequently, the voltage needed to make<br>
the heating currents flow over the heating surface is<br>
lower.<br>
25 Admittedly, this configuration is preferably used for<br>
windshields in which good visibility in the central<br>
viewing field suffices for safe driving, however heated<br>
glazing units according to the invention may also be<br>
fitted at other places on the vehicle,  and also in<br>
30  other machines and moving equipment and in buildings.<br>
Whereas in conventional solar cells with gate or comb<br>
electrodes the voltage is applied over the thickness of<br>
the layer of the absorber, a voltage is applied in the<br>
35 application according to the invention for the purpose<br>
of making a current flow in the plane of the coating.<br>
The conducting strands and the semiresistive -regions<br>
according to the invention thus have the effect of<br>
bringing the busbars, customarily placed along the edge<br><br>
- 13 -<br>
of the glazing,  electrically closer together without<br>
however appreciably degrading the general viewing field<br>
of the glazing and without degrading at all the main<br>
viewing field A.<br>
5<br>
Moreover, it should be recognized that in document<br>
WO 00/72635 cited above, the electric field, and<br>
consequently the heating field, does not include a<br>
semiresistive region since the strip that surrounds the<br>
10 communication window is excluded from the electric<br>
field owing to the fact that a resistive region is<br>
interposed between the closest busbar and the<br>
communication window that it surrounds. The trace of<br>
the electric field lines in the last figure of the<br>
15 above document shows that the lines go around the<br>
communication window while still remaining in the<br>
resistive coating, without passing through the strip<br>
that surrounds the communication window.<br>
2 0 When used in a vehicle, the configuration according to<br>
the invention makes it possible in particular for the<br>
windshield to be supplied directly, in order to heat<br>
it, with the usual onboard voltage of 12 to 14 V DC,<br>
for which voltage a coating having as low as possible<br>
25  an ohmic  resistance  is  of  course  recommended.  The<br>
extent of the semiresistive regions or else the length<br>
of  the  strands  is  dimensioned  according  to  the<br>
effective surface resistance of the coating chosen<br>
the more conducting the coating itself, the narrower<br>
30 the semiresistive regions may be or the shorter the<br>
strands may be.<br>
Measured from the busbars, the extent of the<br>
semiresistive regions or the length of the strands is<br>
35 greater than the width of the respective busbar to<br>
which they are attached and the strands that extend<br>
into the heating field in contact with the heating<br>
coating.<br><br>
- 14 -<br>
Likewise, with this configuration it is possible to<br>
keep the entire coating on the surface of the<br>
transparent glazing - apart from the optionally<br>
provided communication windows - in such a way that<br>
5 neither masking nor removal of coating is necessary.<br>
Thus, the positive properties of the coating, namely in<br>
particular its infrared reflection (thermal insulation)<br>
and its uniform color (in reflection and in<br>
transmission), are preserved over the entire surface.<br>
10<br>
The conducting strands have a width and/or a thickness<br>
of preferably 0.5 mm or less, and even more preferably<br>
0.3 mm or less, measured in projection on the surface<br>
of the glazing unit.<br>
15<br>
The additional conducting strands, which are also as<br>
thin as possible, only imperceptibly impede vision<br>
through the glazing.<br>
20 Given that the transparent glazing is in almost all<br>
cases a laminated glazing unit in which the coating<br>
itself is placed on a face lying on the inside of the<br>
composite glazing, the conducting strands could also,<br>
apart from printing, be produced in the form of thin<br>
25 wires that are fixed, for example in a manner known per<br>
se, to a composite adhesive film and then deposited,<br>
with this film, on the coating, thus coming into<br>
electrical contact with the coating. This contact is<br>
stable over a long period after the final bonding of<br>
3 0  the laminated glazing.<br>
In the embodiment in the form of screen-printed<br>
structures, the conducting strands are preferably<br>
deposited on a substrate (made of glass or plastic or a<br>
35 plastic film) before the coating is applied. This may<br>
be carried out in a single operation together with the<br>
deposition of the actual busbars.<br>
It is also possible to straddle, with a region of low<br><br>
- 15 -<br>
resistance or with conducting strands, one or more<br>
communication windows produced along the edge of the<br>
glazing in the coating, without any risk of forming hot<br>
spots. The currents in the known problem areas along<br>
5 the lateral edges of such communication windows are<br>
very greatly reduced by the strands.<br>
Other details and advantages of the subject of the<br>
invention will become apparent from the drawings of an<br>
10 exemplary embodiment in the form of a vehicle<br>
windshield and from their detailed description that<br>
follows.<br>
In these schematic drawings,  drawn to no particular<br>
15  scale:<br>
figure 1 illustrates an embodiment of a<br>
transparent glazing unit with a resistive heating<br>
coating, in which embodiment busbars in the form of<br>
strips are connected to grid strands that extend in the<br>
20 form of very fine fingers in the surface of the<br>
glazing;<br>

coating, in which the heating coating includes at least<br>
35  one semiresistive region; and<br>
figure 7 illustrates another embodiment of a<br>
transparent glazing unit with a resistive heating<br>
coating, in which the adhesive layer has a<br>
semiresistive region, the figure being a partial cross<br><br>
- 16 -<br>
section, similar to that illustrated in figure 3,<br>
through another glazing unit.<br>
In the figures, an electrically resistive transparent<br>
5  coating 2 is placed over the entire surface in a manner<br>
known per se  in a heated laminated glazing unit  1<br>
having   an   essentially   trapezoidal   (curvilinear)<br>
outline. The glazing unit 1 has been shown here only in<br>
one half - its other half is equivalent.<br>
10<br>
The coating 2 is deposited in a known manner on a main<br>
face of a substrate 11, this substrate then being<br>
integrated into the glazing unit 1.<br>
15 A broken line denoted by 20 indicates that the outer<br>
edge of the continuously coated surface lies all<br>
around, but slightly set back toward the inside of, the<br>
peripheral outer edge of the laminated glazing unit 1,<br>
that is to say an edge band is provided in the coating<br>
20 all around the surface. Thus, the coating is, "on the<br>
one hand, electrically isolated from the outside and,<br>
on the other hand, protected against any corrosion<br>
damage penetrating via the outer edge of the glazing.<br>
The outer edge 2 0 may be set back by removing the<br>
25 coating along the edge of the glazing, by masking the<br>
outline of the substrate before the coating is<br>
deposited on this substrate, or else by tracing a<br>
separating line that passes through the coating and<br>
runs along the outer edge of the substrate, which may<br>
30 be sufficient for meeting the isolation and corrosion<br>
protection objectives.<br>
The coating 2 itself is preferably made up, in a" manner<br>
known per se, from a multilayer solar-protection system<br>
35 of high thermal resistance comprising at least one<br>
metal functional layer and preferably at least two<br>
metal functional layers, this system withstanding,<br>
without any damage, the temperatures above 650°C that<br>
are required for bending the glass panes, that is to<br><br>
- 17 -<br>
say without its optical, electrical and heat-reflecting<br>
properties being degraded. The multilayer system also<br>
includes, apart from the metal layers (which are<br>
preferably based on silver), other layers such as<br>
5  antireflection layers and, optionally, barrier layers.<br>
However, in relation to the present invention, it is<br>
also possible to use other electrically conducting<br>
multilayer  systems  that  have  a  low  temperature<br>
10 resistance, and in particular also multilayer systems<br>
that are not deposited directly on a rigid glass pane<br>
but on a plastic film, (preferably a PET film) . All<br>
these multilayer systems are preferably deposited by<br>
sputtering (magnetron cathode sputtering).<br>
15<br>
The surface resistivity of the current multilayer<br>
systems of the type mentioned above lies between about<br>
0.5 and 5 Ω/. Vehicle windshields with such multilayer<br>
systems must achieve overall a light transmission of at<br>
20 least 75% according to some standards, or 70% according<br>
to other standards.<br>
Of course,  the composition and the production of the<br>
coating are of secondary importance here, so that there<br>
25  is no need to dwell on details thereof.<br>
An opaque colored layer 3 in the form of a peripheral<br>
frame has been deposited along the edge of the<br>
laminated glazing unit 1, the inner edge 3 0 of which<br>
30 layer, relative to the outer edge of the glazing unit,<br>
circumscribes the general viewing field of the<br>
transparent glazing unit 1. This layer may lie in a<br>
plane of the laminated glazing unit other than that of<br>
the coating 2 (being located on the inside or on the<br>
35 outside of the composite glazing unit) . It serves as a<br>
layer for protecting a bead of adhesive, with which the<br>
finished glazing unit is bonded to a vehicle body, from<br>
UV radiation. Moreover, it can conceal from view<br>
connection elements for the main electrical heating<br><br>
- 18 -<br>
function and for the optional additional electrical<br>
functions of the glazing unit 1.<br>
Thus, the figure shows, along the upper edge of the<br>
5  laminated glazing unit 1, in the region of the surface<br>
covered by the colored layer 3, a first busbar 4 and,<br>
along the lower edge,  a second busbar 5.  The two<br>
busbars 4 and 5 are in direct conducting electrical<br>
connection with the coating 2, in a manner known per<br>
10  se.<br>
Figures 1, 2 and 5 show, in half in the middle of the<br>
glazing unit, a communication window 22 below the<br>
busbar 4, which communication window is also covered by<br>
15 the colored layer 3 and is therefore concealed from<br>
view. It is also possible to provide several<br>
communication windows.<br>
Many vehicle windshields are provided, along their<br>
20 upper edge, with a band (not shown here) that is bluish<br>
but transparent to light ("band filter"), which in<br>
particular reduces dazzling by sunshine. Likewise, such<br>
a band may also help to conceal the communication<br>
window from view. It may also replace part of the width<br>
2	5  of the band of the colored layer 3 along the upper edge<br>
of the glazing unit, or it may be provided as a<br>
complement thereto. Since the general viewing field of<br>
the glazing is defined by the inner edge of the colored<br>
layer,  it  may  consequently  incorporate  this  bluish<br>
3	0  band.<br>
As a general rule, the laminated glazing unit 1 is made<br>
up from two rigid glass and/or plastic panes 11 and 12<br>
and from an adhesive layer 13 joining the panes at the<br>
35  surface. The busbars 4 and 5 are placed on the adhesive<br>
layer 13  (for example a thermoplastic adhesive film<br>
made of polyvinyl butyral (PVB) , ethylene/vinyl -acetate<br>
(EVA)  or polyurethane  (PU) )  and are fastened to its<br>
surface before the adhesive layer is assembled and<br><br>
- 19 -<br>
bonded to the rigid panes.<br>
The busbars 4 and 5 may be made up from thin narrow<br>
strips of metal (copper or aluminum) film, which are<br>
5 usually fixed beforehand to the adhesive film 13 and<br>
are applied together with an electrical contact to the<br>
coating 2 during assembly of the laminated layers.<br>
However, the electrical contact may also be provided by<br>
soldering the busbars 4 and 5. During the subsequent<br>
10 autoclave process, a reliable contact is made between<br>
the busbars and the coating by the action of heat and<br>
pressure.<br>
The  busbars  4  and  5  may,  as  indicated  above,  be<br>
15  produced, as a variant or as a complement, by printing<br>
a conductive paste, which is baked while the glazing<br>
units are being bent. This is also appreciably less<br>
expensive than positioning parts of metal strips.  In<br>
all cases, the printed busbars have, during continuous<br>
2 0  manufacture, a higher ohmic resistance than that of the<br>
strips of metal film. The choice, between busbars made<br>
of metal film and busbars in screen-printed band form,<br>
therefore depends only on the type of glazing and<br>
possibly on the overall resistance of the multilayer<br>
2 5  heating system.<br>
Compared with the coating 2, the busbars are always of<br>
negligible  ohmic  resistance  and  do  not  heat  up<br>
appreciably during operation of the heating means,<br>
30<br>
Applying a voltage between the two busbars 4 and 5 in<br>
the heating coating generates an electric field and,<br>
through the resistive effect, a heating field.<br>
35 Two (or more) heating fields may be provided, in a<br>
manner known per se, in the laminated glazing unit 1,<br>
which heating fields are to be supplied separately (for<br>
example with a vertical division down the middle of the<br>
glazing unit) and must also, of course, be connected to<br><br>
- 20 -<br>
their respective power supply via separate conducting<br>
connectors. In this case, a common ground conductor may<br>
be used for the two heating fields, in such a way that<br>
only the busbar 4 or the busbar 5 has to be divided<br>
5 into two parts, whereas the other busbar is continuous.<br>
In the first version, four external connectors are<br>
required, whereas in the second only three are<br>
required.<br>
10 The external connectors will not be discussed in detail<br>
here, because they have already been described many<br>
times in the art.<br>
The outer boundary of the main viewing field A of the<br>
15 windshield, lying on the inside of the general "viewing<br>
field circumscribed by the edge 30 of the colored layer<br>
3, is indicated schematically by a dotted line L. The<br>
line L does not constitute an actual edge or the like<br>
in the glazing or in the coating, rather it serves<br>
20 merely to visually illustrate the approximate position<br>
of the main viewing field A. The latter is described in<br>
Annex 18 of the ECE R4 3 by means of certain parameters<br>
of an arbitrary vehicle environment. In this field, no<br>
perceptible degradation of vision having a size of<br>
25 greater than 3 0 microns is permitted. In the secondary<br>
viewing field B, around the outside of the main viewing<br>
field A, slight limitations in vision, due to<br>
additions, etc., are permitted.<br>
3 0 According to the invention, when an electrical supply<br>
voltage is applied between the busbars 4 and 5, a<br>
current flows, forming a heating field in the coating,<br>
this heating field including a semiresistive region 6<br>
in direct contact with the upper busbar 4.<br>
35<br>
Thanks to the present invention, the heating current<br>
flows between the busbars via the coating 2 in a<br>
heating field that has a region of lower resistivity<br>
and then a region having a higher resistivity.<br><br>
- 21 -<br>
However, in a preferred version of the invention, the<br>
heating current flows between the busbars via the<br>
coating 2 in a heating field that has a region of lower<br>
5 resistivity and then a region of higher resistivity and<br>
then once again a region of lower resistivity.<br>
As illustrated in figures 1 and 6 in particular, an<br>
upper  semiresistive  region 6  thus  extends  downward<br>
10 beyond the area covered by the colored layer 3 in the<br>
general viewing field of the glazing toward the main<br>
viewing field A and a lower semiresistive region 6'<br>
extends upward beyond the area covered by the colored<br>
layer 3 in the general viewing field of the glazing<br>
15  toward the main viewing field A.<br>
In a first version of the invention, illustrated in<br>
figures 1 to 5, starting from the upper busbar 4, a<br>
semiresistive region 6 formed by a set of lines extends<br>
20 beneath the colored layer 3, then, in the general<br>
viewing field of the laminated glazing unit 1, from the<br>
edge region covered by the colored layer 3, into the<br>
secondary viewing field B.<br>
25 These lines terminate blindly in the secondary viewing<br>
field B, more or less near the boundary of the main<br>
viewing field A. The length of the lines thus produced<br>
depends directly on the conductivity of the coating<br>
chosen.<br>
30<br>
These lines represent conducting strands 46, which are<br>
electrically connected to the busbar 4 and to the<br>
coating 2 and have a low ohmic resistance compared with<br>
the latter. A number of these lines also straddle the<br>
35 communication window 22 in such a way as to guarantee<br>
that the coating 2 on either side of the communication<br>
window, seen from the busbar 4, is supplied directly<br>
with power. From the visual standpoint, these lines<br>
that straddle the communication window 22 are masked by<br><br>
- 22 -<br>
the colored layer 3. Another form of masking may, as<br>
already indicated, be optionally provided by a band of<br>
bluish color (band filter), but not shown here.<br>
5 Conducting strands 56, similar to the conducting<br>
strands 46, also extend into the viewing field B of the<br>
laminated glazing unit 1 from the lower busbar 5.<br>
In  each  case,  the  combination  of  the  conducting<br>
10  strands, 46 or 56 respectively, forms with the coating<br>
2 a semiresistive region according to the invention.<br>
It is unnecessary to provide such conducting strands 46<br>
and 56 for both busbars, 4 and 5 respectively. However,<br>
15 if conducting strands are provided on both sides of the<br>
main viewing field A, they in no case extend in such a<br>
way that conducting strands of opposite polarity<br>
overlap in a projection perpendicular to their overall<br>
directions.  Thus,  the  central  part  of  the  general<br>
20 viewing field and of the heating field, "and in<br>
particular the main viewing field A, remains<br>
undisturbed.<br>
Whereas  in  conventional  glazing  units  with  layer<br>
25  heating  without  a  semiresistive  region  the  heating<br>
current has  to flow only via the coating over the<br>
entire distance between the busbars, this distance may<br>
be reduced to values of between 2 5% and 80% by the<br>
semiresistive region(s) according to the invention and<br>
3 0  in particular by the conducting strands according to<br>
the present invention, depending on the extent of the<br>
viewing field A,  some of the current  spanning the<br>
remaining distance in the semiresistive region'(s) and<br>
in particular in the conducting strands.<br>
35<br>
In figures 1 and 2, the strands 46 and 56 are placed<br>
uniformly apart and are all produced with the same<br>
length.<br><br>
- 23 -<br>
The inner end of the conducting strands is<br>
substantially at the same potential as the busbars to<br>
which they are connected.<br>
5 In the general viewing field of the glazing unit, the<br>
current flows approximately perpendicular to the<br>
busbars 4 and 5 and parallel to the longitudinal<br>
general direction of the conducting strands 46, 56.<br>
10 Thus, the current flows in the general viewing field in<br>
a direction approximately parallel to the longitudinal<br>
direction of the conducting strands.<br>
As previously, a flow of current, even though small,<br>
15  remains over the entire surface of the coating, because<br>
the busbars are not separated from the coating in the<br>
parts located between the conducting strands. However,<br>
this current flow does not result in the formation of<br>
hot spots along the edges of the communication window<br>
20  22.<br>
To meet the abovementioned objectives of the present<br>
invention, the conducting strands, 46 and 56<br>
respectively, must also be in intimate galvanic contact<br>
25 with the coating, in addition to their good<br>
conductivity (so as thereby to form, as mentioned<br>
above, a semiresistive region). Certainly, in principle<br>
it is conceivable to produce them in the form of wire<br>
portions. However, they are preferably printed, before<br>
3 0 the coating is deposited, on that surface of the<br>
glazing unit that subsequently will have to bear the<br>
coating. Certainly it is also possible to print them on<br>
the finished coating, but this runs the risk of<br>
damaging the multilayer coating, which is mechanically<br>
3 5  weak.<br>
Preferably, the conducting strands are printed using a<br>
very conductive screen-printing paste containing at<br>
least 80%, and preferably more than 85%, silver.<br><br>
- 24 -<br>
These conducting strands preferably have a dark color<br>
seen via an outer face of the glazing, so as to be not<br>
easily perceptible to the viewer's eyes when he is<br>
5 looking from the outside into the vehicle and, also<br>
preferably, have a light color, seen via an inner face<br>
of the glazing, so as to be not easily perceptible to<br>
the eyes of the viewer when he is looking out from<br>
inside the vehicle.<br>
10<br>
If printed busbars 4 and 5 are used, they may then be<br>
produced in a single operation at the same time as the<br>
conducting strands 46/56 and using the same<br>
screen-printing paste. No separate operation is then<br>
15  needed to bring the conducting strands into electrical<br>
contact with the busbars.<br>
However, if busbars in the form of strips of metal film<br>
are used, these then have to be connected with a low<br>
2	0  ohmic resistance to the coating and to the conducting<br>
strands. The strips of film, which are preferably<br>
tinned, are therefore soldered to the conducting<br>
strands in a manner known per se. In principle, the<br>
screen-printing pastes with a high metal content that<br>
25 are used here are easily soldered to the tinned metal<br>
strips.<br>
The lengths, separations and number of the conducting<br>
strands 4 6 and 56 and the dimensions of the busbars can<br>
30 only be shown here schematically. However, their<br>
relative dimensions may be seen - whereas the busbars 4<br>
and 5 are produced in the form of a usual band with a<br>
width of a few millimeters, the conducting strands 46<br>
and  56  are  as  close  together  and as  invisible  as<br>
3	5  possible,  and  however  appreciably  longer  than  the<br>
widths of the busbars.<br>
The individual configuration in a specific laminated<br>
glazing unit may certainly be broadly predetermined by<br><br>
- 25 -<br>
simulation. However, it will depend again very greatly<br>
on the respective magnitude of the dimensions of the<br>
specific glazing, on the type of busbars and on the<br>
actual electrical properties of the coating. It may for<br>
5 example also be sufficient to add conducting strands<br>
only to one of the busbars. For a relatively short<br>
distance between the two busbars 4 and 5, the<br>
conducting strands themselves may also be shortened.<br>
10 In the case of straight lines for a vehicle glazing<br>
unit, these lines are not parallel but converge toward<br>
the busbar to which they are attached, preferably in<br>
such a way that a longitudinal symmetry (along the<br>
longitudinal axis of the vehicle) may be observed in<br>
15  the glazing.<br>
It has been determined, for one specific type of<br>
glazing unit, that spacing of 25 mm between the various<br>
conducting strands can be used. However,  the surface<br>
20 heating power levels available in the semiresistive<br>
regions can if necessary be adjusted, by varying the<br>
spacing, for a given resistance of the conducting<br>
strands. Furthermore, to simplify matters, only<br>
straight conducting strands have been shown here, but<br>
25 * this does not exclude the possibility in practice of<br>
producing them in curved and/or corrugated " forms,<br>
and/or in the form of open or closed loops and/or in<br>
portions of arcs and/or in meanders, which could be<br>
less visible.<br>
30<br>
Figure 2 shows an alternative embodiment in which the<br>
coating 2 is divided by separating lines 24 in the<br>
general viewing field. The separating lines 24 may pass<br>
entirely through the coating down to the surface of the<br>
35 substrate, or else they may penetrate only as far as<br>
the conducting partial layer close to the substrate.<br>
They have to divide the coating, which by nature is<br>
continuous, into current paths. Various techniques<br>
exist for producing such separating lines, among which<br><br>
- 26 -<br>
laser cutting is currently the most common, because it<br>
is the most economic regarding the result. In<br>
particular, the separating lines that can be produced<br>
are thus extremely narrow and only perceptible to the<br>
5  naked eye with difficulty.<br>
If figure 2 is taken as representing the view seen by<br>
the driver of a left-hand drive vehicle, he will<br>
usually have to look through the surface part in which<br>
10 the separating lines 24 are the closest together. The<br>
purpose of these lines is to collect the current flow<br>
through the coating 2 in the main viewing field A<br>
precisely in this region, and thus provide the highest<br>
heating power in this main viewing region when his<br>
15 vision is obstructed by snow, ice or water dropl-ets and<br>
to provide clear vision as quickly and as effectively<br>
as possible.<br>
Here too, the arrangement of the separating lines 24<br>
20 has been indicated only schematically and only few<br>
conclusions may be drawn as to actual configurations.<br>
It is also not always judicious to always trace<br>
continuous separating lines, rather it is possible to<br>
produce some or all of them as segmented separating<br>
25 lines, so to speak dotted lines, or to provide, instead<br>
of the longer separating lines, a few short portions in<br>
order to deflect the current in certain predetermined<br>
paths. However, this is already also known from<br>
document DE 36 44 297 A1 mentioned above.<br>
30<br>
However, here again, it is obvious that the heating<br>
current in the general viewing field flows<br>
approximately in an overall direction perpendicular to<br>
the busbars and parallel to the longitudinal axes of<br>
35  the conducting strands 46/56.<br>
Figure 3 shows a sectional view through the edge of the<br>
glazing unit 1 along the line III-III of figure 1. Two<br>
rigid  individual  panes  11,  12  (made  of  glass  or<br><br>
- 27 -<br>
plastic) and an electrically insulating adhesive layer<br>
13, which is optically transparent and joining said<br>
panes together by bonding in the usual manner, may be<br>
seen. This adhesive layer 13 is subdivided horizontally<br>
5 by dot-dash lines in order to indicate that it is in<br>
fact considerably thicker than the transparent coating<br>
2 deposited on the lower pane 12. This coating is<br>
shaded gray here for the sake of visibility. The<br>
adhesive layer may be formed in the usual manner by a<br>
10  PVB film having a thickness of about 0.76 mm.<br>
The numerical references in figures 1 and 2 have been<br>
preserved. The coating 2, the outer edge region of<br>
which is separated by the separating lines 20, is, as<br>
15 may be seen, located on the pane 12 above the busbar 5<br>
and the conducting strands 56 connected to the latter,<br>
which strands have been deposited here, - before<br>
deposition of the coating 2, in the form of<br>
screen-printed structures. The opaque colored layer 3<br>
2 0 here is printed on that face of the pane 11 located on<br>
the inside of the composite glazing unit and overlaps,<br>
in vertical projection (the viewing direction) the<br>
separating line 20, the busbar 5 and the conducting<br>
strands in their part which is connected directly to<br>
25 the busbar. However, the conducting strands also extend<br>
beyond the edge 3 0 of the opaque colored layer 3 as far<br>
as the general viewing field of the glazing unit 1.<br>
The opaque colored layer 3 could also, unlike in the<br>
30 representation, be located on the outer faces (not<br>
visible here) of one of the panes 11 or 12, or also on<br>
the same surface as the coating 2 and the busbars 4 and<br>
5.<br>
35 Figure 4 illustrates the arrangement of the conducting<br>
strands through another section, the viewing direction<br>
of which starts from the right in figure 3 in the plane<br>
of the surface of the pane 12. The view is therefore<br>
toward the front faces of the conducting strands 56, in<br><br>
- 28 -<br>
the background of which the busbar 5 extends<br>
transversely to the viewing direction.<br>
To improve viewing, in the region of the central<br>
5 conducting strand in figure 4, the coating 2 on the<br>
surface of the pane 12 has been partly removed More<br>
precisely, it may be seen that both the busbar and the<br>
conducting strand lie beneath the coating 2 on the<br>
surface of the pane 12.<br>
10<br>
In another embodiment, illustrated in figure 5, with<br>
the busbar manufactured from strips of metal  films,<br>
these would be applied to the coating 2 and assembled<br>
to the latter as continuously as possible and with as<br>
15 low a resistance as possible by soldered assemblies or,<br>
where necessary, also by conductive adhesives (this<br>
also being known as an alternative). The soldered<br>
assemblies must of course be provided in particular at<br>
the conducting strands.<br>
20<br>
In a second version of the invention, illustrated in<br>
figure 6, starting from the upper busbar 4, a<br>
semiresistive region 6 formed by a particular region of<br>
the heating coating 2 and illustrated by crossed dotted<br>
25 lines, extends beneath the colored layer 3 and then<br>
into the general viewing field of the laminated glazing<br>
unit 1 from the edge region covered by the colored<br>
layer 3 toward the inside of the secondary viewing<br>
field B. In this semiresistive region 6, the resistance<br>
30 of the heating coating 2 is less than the resistance of<br>
the heating coating outside any semiresistive region.<br>
In this semiresistive region 6, the resistance of the<br>
heating coating 2 is two times, five times or even ten<br>
35  times less, or even less, than the resistance of the<br>
resistive coating outside any semiresistive region.<br>
Starting from the lower busbar 5, a semiresistive<br>
region  6'  formed by  one  particular  region  of  the<br><br>
- 29 -<br>
heating coating 2, similar to the semiresistive region<br>
6 and illustrated also by crossed dotted lines, extends<br>
into the viewing field B of the laminated glazing unit<br>
1.<br>
5<br>
It is not necessary to provide such semiresistive<br>
regions of the coating for both busbars, 4 and 5<br>
respectively. However, if semiresistive regions of the<br>
coating are provided on both sides of the main viewing<br>
10 field A, they do not extend into the central part of<br>
the general viewing field and of the heating field, and<br>
in particular the main viewing field A remains<br>
undisturbed.<br>
15 This second version may be obtained in industrial<br>
practice by depositing additional layers in<br>
semiresistive regions, either during deposition of the<br>
heating coating itself, by transverse variations in the<br>
thicknesses of the layers on the large plates coated<br>
20 continuously with the heating coating, or after the<br>
substrates coated with the heating coating have been<br>
cut out, by an additional local deposition on these<br>
substrates.<br>
25 In a third version of the invention, illustrated in<br>
figure 7, the glazing is a composite glazing unit that<br>
includes at least one adhesive layer 13' in electrical<br>
contact with the heating coating 2. This adhesive layer<br>
13'   includes  at  least  one  semiresistive  region<br>
30 illustrated here by a band 60 of semiresistive plastic.<br>
This band is included in that face of the adhesive<br>
layer that will be in contact with the heating coating<br>
2 during manufacture of the layer so that, during<br>
manufacture of the glazing unit, the plastic band 60 is<br>
3 5  in contact with the busbar 5.<br>
This third version is illustrated in the lower part of<br>
the glazing unit, but it may of course also, or<br>
instead, be used in the upper part of the glazing unit.<br><br>
- 30 -<br>
It is also possible for the plastic band or portion to<br>
be produced over the entire thickness of the adhesive<br>
layer 13' or else for it to be formed by a strip of<br>
5 plastic that incorporates a conducting grid on its<br>
surface in contact with the heating coating.<br>
It is also conceivable to combine the plastic band 60,<br>
which is possibly conducting, with the coating*2 as a<br>
10 semiresistive region, since in each case that part of<br>
the coating 2 which is covered by said band 6 0 conducts<br>
at least part of the heating current.<br>
To produce such a semiresistive or quite conductive<br>
15  plastic band 60, it is for example possible to dope a<br>
"matrix" material of the thermoplastic film used (PVB,<br>
EVA  or  polyurethane)  with  conducting  particles,<br>
especially metal particles, of such a density that the<br>
region or volume in question is at least semiresistive<br>
20  or even conductive.  Such doping is possible without<br>
excessively impeding the light transmission.<br>
The present invention has been described in the<br>
foregoing by way of example. Of course, a person<br>
25 skilled in the art is capable of producing various<br>
alternative embodiments of the invention without<br>
thereby departing from the scope of the patent as<br>
defined by the claims.<br>
30 A person skilled in the art is in particular capable of<br>
combining various versions and embodiments of the<br>
invention described above.<br><br>
