				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>High-temperature lubricant and its use<br>
The invention relates to high-temperature lubricants for the lubrication of two areally<br>
touching heated metal objects that execute a relative movement vis-a-vis each other.<br>
For example, in the production of seamless steel or non-ferrous metal pipes, it is<br>
important to intensively lubricate the tools, in particular the mandrel rods in order that<br>
they have the highest possible lives. The surfaces of the mandrel rods are to be<br>
uniform and smooth in order to ensure a uniform material flow of the metal to be<br>
processed.<br>
The quality of the inner pipe surfaces depends on the surface quality of the mandrel<br>
rods. If the inner surface of the pipes is rough or rippled or even has damage that is<br>
attributable to the quality of the mandrels, there is a high discard rate. Efforts have<br>
therefore already been made in the past to increase the lives of mandrel rods by<br>
applying lubricants to them.<br>
Organic lubricants used in the thermoforming of metals, such as fats, oils or soaps,<br>
proved unsuitable at high temperatures. To improve the lubricant properties, graphite<br>
was therefore used as an essential constituent of the lubricant in DE-PS 4 300 464 or<br>
EP-PS 0 554 822. In particular in conjunction with inorganic salts such as for example<br>
borates or phosphates, graphite has good separation and lubrication properties.<br>
Disadvantageous however is the tendency of graphite to contribute at high<br>
temperatures to carbonizations of the workpiece surfaces, here the pipe surfaces. Tool<br>
and workpiece can also become welded together pointwise. The result of both effects<br>
is a high tool wear and a high discard rate of the workpieces.<br>
To avoid this negative effect of graphite, salt mixtures have already been used as<br>
high-temperature lubricants which melt at the working temperatures at which they are<br>
used as lubricants and ensure good lubricant properties in the liquid state. Such salt<br>
mixtures are known from EP-OS 0 829 528, which for improvement also contain a<br>
gas-forming additive. According to column 3, lines 41 to 48 of this document, an<br>
advantage of these lubricants is that they already begin to melt at 200 to 250°C and<br>
are present as clear melts as of 500°C. As a result good lubricant properties are<br>
already to be ensured at low temperatures.<br>
With such lubricants that are present as melts at working temperatures, scale that has<br>
formed and so-called secondary scale is firmly stuck to the tool, as a result of which<br>
the surfaces of the tool, such as the mandrel rod, becomes correspondingly rough. As<br>
mentioned above, this results for its part in roughness of the inner surfaces of the .<br>
pipes. At the same time the flow behaviour of the metallic material on the mandrel<br><br>
rods is disrupted, which manifests itself when measuring the current consumption<br>
between the individual roll grooves.<br>
The object of the invention is thus to obtain a high-temperature lubricant to which no<br>
graphite need be added and which reduces the discard rates compared with a use of<br>
known lubricants. In particular, with the help of the new lubricants the services lives<br>
of mandrel bars in the production of metal pipes are to be increased and the quality of<br>
the inner pipe surfaces improved.<br>
This object is achieved according to the invention with high-temperature lubricants<br>
for the lubrication of two areally touching heated metal objects that execute a relative<br>
movement vis-a-vis each other in that the lubricant comprises at least 80 wt.-% of at<br>
least one alkali orthophosphate and has a melting temperature above the maximum<br>
working temperature of the heated metal objects.<br>
Although it is known to add alkali phosphate to graphite-free mandrel-bar lubricants,<br>
the alkali phosphates in such lubricants account for only a relatively small percentage<br>
and are mixed with other salts such that the lubricant is present in melted, i.e. liquid,<br>
state at the working temperatures.<br>
The high-temperature lubricants according to the invention can be used wherever two<br>
areally touching metal objects execute a relative movement vis-a-vis each other at<br>
high temperatures. These are for example friction bearings with which high<br>
temperatures can occur. Preferably however the lubricants according to the invention<br>
are used where the areally touching metal objects are a tool on the one hand and a<br>
workpiece on the other. The lubricants are quite particularly suitable for the<br>
lubrication of mandrel bars in the production of seamless metal pipes.<br>
In principle, the inventive concept is suitable for the lubrication of any metal objects,<br>
but is particularly suitable for the machining of steel objects, in particular as<br>
mentioned above for the production of seamless steel pipes in which the mandrel bars<br>
are lubricated with the lubricant according to the invention. However this is not<br>
intended to exclude the use of the lubricants according to the invention for example<br>
for the production of pipes from non-ferrous metals, aluminium or similar.<br>
Here, by maximum working temperatures is meant the highest temperature occurring<br>
on the lubricated contact surface, as this could melt the lubricant if the melting<br>
temperature of the lubricant were lower than it, which is to be avoided. When<br>
machining workpieces with a tool, as a rule the workpiece will have the higher<br>
temperature and the tool the lower temperature, as in the case of the use of mandrel<br>
bars in the production of metal pipes. The maximum working temperature above<br><br>
which the melting temperature of the lubricant is to lie is in this case the temperature<br>
of the hotter metal object, i.e. the workpiece.<br>
Expediently the high-temperature lubricant according to the invention is present in the<br>
form of an aqucous solution. This is applied for example to the mandrel bars during<br>
pipe production or elsewhere and, after the water has evaporated, forms a fine<br>
separation and lubricant film that is extremely abrasion-resistant when used. As the<br>
lubricant does not melt due to its high melting temperature when used, scale is<br>
prevented by the lubricant from becoming fixed on the mandrel bar surface or other<br>
tool surface. After drying, the lubricant is present in the form of very fine particles<br>
that fill all the surface roughnesses of the tool surface and thus smooth this surface,<br>
which is transmitted to the workpiece surface. The separation film formed also<br>
promotes the material flow on the workpiece surface of the metal to be formed and<br>
therefore has the character of an excellent lubricating film.<br>
The high-temperature lubricant according to the invention is particularly suitable in<br>
the case of the Assel rolling process with the "free mandrel bar" technique and in the<br>
case of the rotary forge process. Clear advantages with regard to the surface quality,<br>
the life of the mandrels and the exertion of force between the roll stands are also<br>
achieved with continuous rolling, e.g. according to the "semi-floating" principle.<br>
With the lubricants according to the invention, clear, high-percentage solutions can be<br>
easily prepared that are to be applied to the mandrels by means of airless pumps and<br>
nozzles. Atomization is also possible using air. so-called binary nozzles, or similar.<br>
Naturally, the lubricant can also be applied in powder form.<br>
The melting temperature of the lubricant according to the invention is expediently at<br>
least 10°C above the maximum working temperature that was defined above.<br>
The lubricant is to consist largely of one or more alkali orthophosphates, the alkali<br>
orthophosphale content being expediently at least 95 wt.-%. If several alkali<br>
orthophosphates are used, care is to be taken that the melting temperature is above the<br>
maximum working temperature with such mixtures also.<br>
I ip to a maximum 20 wt.-%, preferably up to a maximum 5 wt.-% of the lubricant can<br>
consist of other substances, which can optionally also include small quantities of<br>
graphite, which as a rule however is not preferred.<br>
The expediently used alkali orthophosphates are trisodium orthophosphatc with a<br>
melting temperature of 1583°C, tripotassium orthophosphate with a melting<br>
temperature of 1340°C and trilithium orthophosphale with a melting temperature of<br><br>
857°C. Trisodium orthophosphatc and tripotassium orthophosphatc are preferred, in<br>
particular the latter. Provided the melting temperature of the lubricant remains high<br>
enough, other phosphates can also be added in smaller quantities.<br>
It has been shown that with the addition of small quantities of alkali aluminate and/or<br>
alkali zincate, the fineness of the lubricant particles, and thus the adhesion of the<br>
lubricant to the metal surface, is improved. It ,s thus preferred to add to the lubricant,<br>
in each case in a quantity of at most 5 wt.-%. preferably 0.2 to 3 wt.-%, at least one<br>
alkali aluminate and/or at least one alkali zincate. As mentioned, the superfine<br>
particles of the lubricant settle in all depressions of the surface and in so doing seal<br>
them, with the result that the scale cannot settle in these depressions. The lubricating<br>
action can therefore also be described as smoothing.<br>
The actual melting temperature of the lubricant according to the invention depends on<br>
the maximum working temperature when using the lubricant and thus on the condition<br>
of the areally touching heated metal objects. Thus the melting temperature of the<br>
lubricant can be relatively low if it is to he used to produce pipes from non-ferrous<br>
metal or aluminium, as relatively low working temperatures are employed with these<br>
metallic materials. When machining steel, a lubricant with much higher melting<br>
temperatures must be used, these in turn depending on whether chrome nickel steels<br>
with working temperatures of approximately 1050 to 1100°C or steels with higher<br>
working temperatures are used. When lubricating tools for steel workpieces, such as<br>
for example when lubricating mandrel rods for producing steel pipes, the melting<br>
temperature is expediently above 1100°C, preferably above 1200°C. When lubricating<br>
tools for the machining of non-ferrous metals, the melting temperatures can be for<br>
example 600 or 650°C.<br>
Taking account of the technical teaching according to the invention, lubricants with<br>
different melting temperatures are expediently prepared, which is to be easily<br>
achieved by varying the ingredients and the quantities of the mixture. The appropriate<br>
lubricant, the melting temperature of which is known, can then be selected for each<br>
work process.<br>
The following examples serve to further explain the invention.<br>
Example 1<br>
On an Assel rolling mill with free mandrel rod, a mixture of 99 wt.-% tripotassium<br>
orthophosphate and 1 wt.-% sodium zincate (each relative to the solids content of the<br>
lubricant) was poured as 10% aqueous solution into the tank that served to cool the<br>
rods alter the rolling process had ended. The temperature of the bath and mandrel rod<br><br>
was 80 to 90°C. After the Assel mandrel was dried, it was coated with a white<br>
lubricant film. Light- to medium-alloyed steels were rolled with the Assel rolling mill.<br>
The lives of the Assel mandrels were able to be increased by 25% compared with<br>
Assel mandrels lubricated with a known lubricant. The surface-roughness<br>
measurements of the inner surface of the finished pipes that were used for antifriction<br>
bearings showed a reduction from 22 µm to 10 µm.<br>
Example 2<br>
In a tube-piercing bench unit, the mandrels with a diameter of 130 mm were treated<br>
by spraying-on of a 20% lubricant solution comprising 98 wt.-% tripotassium<br>
orthophosphate and 2 wt.-% sodium aluminate (both relative to the solids content of<br>
the lubricant). The mandrels had a temperature of 450°C. A white coherent lubricant<br>
layer was produced. Medium- to high-alloyod steels were rolled. The impact force<br>
between the roll stands was reduced by 35% compared with conventional lubricants.<br>
The durability of the mandrels increased by 20%. The inner surface of the pipes was<br>
clearly smoother than when using the known lubricants. The quality test showed a<br>
reduction in the discard rate from 4 to less than 1 %.<br><br>
