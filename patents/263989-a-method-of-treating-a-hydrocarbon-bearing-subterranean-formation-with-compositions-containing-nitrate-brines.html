				<td>Field of the Invention<br>
The invention relates to well treatment fluids which exhibit enhanced thermal stability and which contain a brine of an alkali nitrate and to methods of using such compositions.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Aqueous based well treatment fluids are commonly used in drilling, stimulation, completion and work over operations of subterranean formations. Treatment designs typically mandate such fluids to exhibit a certain level of viscosity. Viscosifying polymers, such as polysaccharides, are often used in such fluids therefore to provide die requisite viscosity. For instance, the viscosifying polymer often provides the requisite level of viscosity needed to prevent the loss of well treatment fluids into the formation. In drilling fluids, such polymers serve to suspend sods and assist in floating debris out of the well bore.<br>
Unfortunately, the thermal stability of aqueous well treatment fluids containing a viscosifying polymer is often compromised as such fluids pass down the well bore and are exposed to increasing temperatures. Temperatures in subterranean formations generally rise about 1°C per hundred feet of depth. It is important, therefore, that such aqueous fluids are thermally stable at elevated temperatures.<br>
Thermal instability typically causes degradation of the polymeric viscosifying agent which causes the viscosity of the well treatment fluid to decrease. A decrease in viscosity of a well treatment fluid often has detrimental effects on the wellbore treatment operation.   For instance, a decrease in viscosity of drilling fluid often results in loss of<br><br>
suspension of drill cuttings which, in turns, results in the inability of such cuttings to float out of the wellbore. In addition, during drilling operations, degradation of the polymeric viscosifying agent may cause the drill string to bind in the wellbore and induce formation damage.<br>
Ancillary to the need for maintaining viscosity, the well treatment fluid must have a sufficiently high density for the well treatment fluid to be operable at high temperatures and be able to withstand relatively high fluid pressures downhole.<br>
High density brines have been found to have particular applicability in deep wells, such as those that descend 15,000 to 30,000 feet (4,500 to 10,000 meters) or more below the earth's surface, where it is most desirous to reduce pump pressure. Such brines have been found to be capable of maintaining the requisite lubricity and viscosity of the well treatment fluid under extreme shear, pressure and temperature variances encountered during operations of deep wells.<br>
Exemplary of high density brines are sodium chloride, potassium chloride, calcium chloride, sodium bromide, calcium bromide, zinc bromide, potassium format, cesium formate and sodium formate brines. While nitrate brines have been suggested for use in well treatment fluids such as completion and packer fluids, efforts to use such brines for such applications were abandoned, however, in the late 1950s after it was discovered that they contributed to stress corrosion cracking of carbon steels. Intergranular corrosion was further found to be caused when mixing chloride and nitrates. See, for instance, Hudgins and Great house, "Corrosion Problems in the Use of Dense Salt Solutions", Corrosion. November, 1960, wherein it was reported the corrosion process could be inhibited by saturating the brine with lime or by keeping the pH above about 9. However, entrained carbon dioxide from the producing well reduced the pH of the brine. The use of such brines was, therefore, severely hindered.<br>
One area of particular applicability for high density brines is in production stimulation treatments of deep wells wherein the brine fluid is used as a fracturing fluid. Pumping through work strings in such wells typically requires tremendous pressures. H is not uncommon that the amount of horsepower required for a job cannot be provided in light of the extremely high friction pressures generated during the pumping stage. In such instances, the hydrostatic pressure of a high density fluid counterbalances the<br><br>
pressure exerted by the fluid in the strata. In addition to having high density, the fracturing fluid must be highly viscous in order for it to suspend prop pant. It is the prop pant which is deposited into the created fractures and which prevents the formed fractures from closing after the completion of pumping. Conductive channels are thereby formed through which produced fluids may flow to the wellbore.<br>
Unfortunately, under the severe wellbore conditions encountered in the treatment of deep wells, many viscosifying agents, particularly polysaccharides, degrade and depolymerization, thus losing their effectiveness.<br>
As interest in treatment operations at deeper depths increases, there is a continual need for alternative well treatment fluids having enhanced thermal stability and which maintain their density at downhole conditions at least for two to three hours. It is further important that such alternative well treatment fluids be capable of reducing the requisite pump pressure generated during the well treatment operation.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
A well treatment fluid containing a crosslinkable polymer, crosslinking agent and a brine containing alkali nitrate is capable of maintaining greater viscosity than a corresponding similar brine-based fluid which does not contain an alkali nitrate. The well treatment fluids defined herein further exhibit enhanced thermal stability when compared to similar brine-based fluids which do not contain an alkali nitrate. The well treatment fluids defined herein, in addition to exhibiting enhanced thermal stability, are further capable of maintaining their density when exposed to deep well conditions. For instance, the well treatment fluids defined herein may demonstrate enhanced thermal stability and maintain their density at downhole temperatures greater than or equal to 400° F.<br>
The density of the brine based well treatment fluids defined herein is typically greater than or equal to 9.0, preferably between from about 9.0 to about 14.0. Typically, the brine is an admixture of an alkali nitrate and an alkali halide, such as sodium bromide.<br>
The crosslinkable polymer of the well treatment fluids is typically guar, hydroxy propyl guar, xanthan gum, carboxymethylhydroxyethyl cellulose or hydroxyethyl cellulose.<br><br>
The well treatment fluid further contains a crosslinking agent. A crosslinking agent, such as a borate crosslinking agent, is especially desirable when the crosslinkable polymer is guar or hydroxypropyl guar.<br>
The welt treatment fluid may be introduced into a wellbore exposed to high downhole temperatures without degradation of the fluid. The sustained viscosity of the well treatment fluid at such downhole temperatures ensures suspension of solids in the fluid as the fluid circulates through the wellbore.<br>
The well treatment fluids defined herein have particular applicability when used in such well treatment operations as drilling, stimulation, completion, and wnrkover. In a preferred embodiment, the well treatment fluid is introduced into a wellbore penetrating a subterranean formation and is used as a fracturing fluid, fii another embodiment, the well treatment fluid is used to form, subsequent to its introduction into the wellbore, an impermeable barrier. As such, the well treatment composition is efficacious in reducing the loss of circulation fluids (such as drilling fluids, completion fluids and workover fluids) in the wellbore and/or into the flow passages of a formation during well drilling, completion and workover operations.<br>
Brief Description of the Drawings<br>
In order to more fully understand the drawings referred in the Detailed Description of the Preferred Embodiments, a brief description of each drawing is presented, in which:<br>
FIG. 1 is a viscosity profile of a well treatment composition containing sodium nitrate/sodium bromide brine.<br>
FIG. 2 is a viscosity profile of a well treatment composition similar to that of FIG. 1 but containing only sodium bromide brine.<br>
Detailed Description of the Preferred Embodiments<br>
The thermal stability of aqueous well treatment fluids defined herein is improved by use of nitrate brine containing fluids. The viscosity and/or thermal stability exhibited by a well treatment fluid containing an alkali nitrate brine at a given downhole temperature  is  greater than  the  viscosity  and/or thermal   stability  exhibited  by  a<br><br>
substantially similar well treatment fluid having the same pH, polymer, crosslinking agent and polymer loading but which does not contain an alkali nitrate containing brine.<br>
For instance, a well treatment fluid containing 60 parts per gallon (ppg) guar (as crosslinkable polymer) in a 13.1 ppg sodium nitrate/sodium bromide brine exhibits enhanced thermal stability when compared to a well treatment fluid containing 60 ppg guar in a 12.5 ppg sodium bromide brine.<br>
As such, the presence of the nitrate brine serves to maintain stability of the fluid at a temperature greater than about 150° F, generally greater than 200° F. In most instances, the well treatment fluid defined herein demonstrates enhanced thermal stability at downhole temperatures in excess of 300° F. Typically, the well treatment fluid demonstrates enhanced thermal stability at a downhole temperature in excess of 350° F. Since temperatures in excess of 350° F are typically encountered at well depths over 15,000 feet deep (4,500 m), the well treatment fluids defined herein have particular usefulness in deep well operations. The viscosity of the well treatment fluids defined herein is further maintained under the extremely high temperature, pressure and shear conditions seen in deep well operations.<br>
Similarly, thermal stability at a desired temperature may be attained using less polymer with the well treatment fluids defined herein as compared to a substantially similar well treatment fluid which does not contain an alkali nitrate containing brine.<br>
Further, the viscosity of a well treatment fluid introduced into a wellbore may be maintained over a longer time duration at a given temperature when a well treatment fluid defined herein is used as compared to a substantially similar well treatment fluid which does not contain an alkali nitrate containing brine. The well treatment fluids defined herein are typically capable of maintaining a viscosity greater than or equal to about 200 cP at about 40 sec"' shear rate at a temperature of 325° F for over 60 minutes. The ability of well treatment fluids defined herein to exhibit and maintain increased viscosity means that there is a reduced tendency for them to leak off into the formation. As such, the well treatment fluids defined herein are highly compatible when used as a fluid loss pill.<br>
The density of the brine based well treatment fluid is typically greater than or equal to 9.0 and preferably is between from about 9.0 to about 14.0.   In light of the<br><br>
enhanced stability of the well treatment fluid, the density of the fluid is maintained at the operating conditions of the wellbore.<br>
The pH of the well treatment fluid is preferably selected such that chemical degradation of the fluid at operating conditions is minimized. The desired pH stability of the fluid is typically achieved when a pH of 8.0, more preferably 9.0, or greater is maintained. Suitable pH adjustment agents, such as soda ash. potassium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide and alkaline and alkali carbonates and bicarbonates, may be used to maintained the desired pH.<br>
Typically the brine, in addition to containing an alkali nitrate salt, further contains an alkali halide, such as sodium bromide or sodium chloride. Typicaliy the weight ratio of alkali halide to alkali nitrate in the brine is between from about 5:95 to about 95:5. As an example, a brine having a density of 13.1 ppg at 70° F is often chosen since it may easily be prepared by adding enough sodium nitrate to a 12.5 ppg sodium bromide brine to render a saturated brine. Thus, the amount of alkali nitrate in the brine may be that amount sufficient to render a saturated brine. The admixture of salts may provide a brine having a density therefore which is higher than the density of a brine containing only one of the salts.<br>
The nitrate brine of the well treatment fluid is thickened with a crosslinkable polymer. Generally, the well treatment fluid contains between from about 0.1 to about 5 wi % of crosslinkable polymer, preferably about 0.5 to about 4 weight %, even more preferably about 1 to about 3 weight %. Typical polymers include anionic or nonionic polysaccharides, such as cellulose, starch, galactomannan gums, polyvinyl alcohols, polyacrylates, polyacrylamides and mixtures thereof. Crosslinkable cellulose and cellulose derivatives include hydroxyalkyl cellulose, alkylhydroxyalkyl cellulose, carboxyalkyl cellulose and carboxyalkylhydroxyalkyl cellulose derivatives such as hydroxyethyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl cellulose, hydroxybutyl cellulose, hydroxyethylmethyl cellulose, hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose, hydroxylbutylmethyl cellulose, methylhydroxyethyl cellulose, methylhydroxypropyl cellulose, ethylhydroxyethyl cellulose, carboxyethylcellulose, carboxymethylcellulose and carboxymethylhydroxyethy]   cellulose.       Galactomannan   gums   include   guar   gum.<br><br>
hydroxyalkyl guar and carboxyalkylhydroxyalkyl guar and microbial polysaccharides include xanthan, succinoglycan and scleroglucan.<br>
Particularly preferred as crosslinkable polymer are guar, hydroxypropyl guar, xanthan gum, carboxymethylhydroxyethyl cellulose, carboxymethylhydroxypropyl cellulose and hydroxyethyl cellulose.<br>
The fluid may further contain a crosslinking delay agent to control, along with the crosslinking agent, viscosification of the well treatment composition. Suitable crosslinking delay agents may include organic polyols, such as sodium gluconate; sodium glucoheptonate, sorbitol, mannitol, phosphonates, bicarbonate salt, salts, various inorganic and weak organic acids including aminocarboxylic acids and their salts (EDTA, DTPA, etc.) and citric acid and mixtures thereof. Preferred crosslinking delaying agents include various organic or inorganic acids, sorbitol as well as mixtures thereof.<br>
Further, when used as a fracturing fluid, a delayed internal breaker may be included such that, once the proppant is placed in the fracture, the viscosity of the fluid may then be decreased in order to maximize flowback of the producing well. Delayed internal breakers can include but not limited to peroxides, enzymes, and esters or mixtures thereof.<br>
Suitable crosslinking agents include a borate ion releasing compound, an organometallic or organic complexed metal ion comprising at least one transition metal or alkaline earth metal ion as well as mixtures thereof. Typically, the crosslinking agent is employed in the composition in a concentration of from about 0.001 percent to about 2 percent, preferably from about 0.005 percent to about 1.5 percent, and. most preferably, from about 0.01 percent to about 1.0 percent.<br>
Borate ion releasing compounds which can be employed include, for example. any boron compound which will supply borate ions in the composition, for example, boric acid, alkali metal borates such as sodium diborate, potassium tetraborate, sodium tetraborate (borax), pentaborates and the like and alkaline and zinc metal borates. Such borate ion releasing compounds are disclosed in U.S. Pat. 3,058,909 and U.S. Pat. No. 3.974,077 herein incorporated by reference. In addition, such borate ion releasing compounds include boric oxide (such as selected from H3B03 and B2O3) and polymeric borate compounds.  An example of a suitable polymeric borate compound is a polymeric<br><br>
compound of boric acid and an alkali borate which is commercially available under the trademark POLYBOR® from U.S. Borax of Valencia, Calif.. Mixtures of any of the referenced borate ion releasing compounds may further be employed. Such borate-releasers typically require a basic pH (e.g., 7.0 to 12) for crosslinking to occur.<br>
Further preferred crosslinking agents are reagents, such as organometallic and organic complexed metal compounds, which can supply zirconium IV ions such as, for example, zirconium lactate, zirconium lactate triethanolamine, zirconium carbonate, zirconium acetylacetonate and zirconium diisopropyiamine lactate; as well as compounds that can supply titanium IV ions such as, for example, titanium ammonium lactate, titanium triethanolamine, and titanium acetylacetonate. Zr (IV) and Ti (IV) may further be added directly as ions or oxy ions into the composition.<br>
Such organometallic and organic complexed metal crosslinking agents containing titanium or zirconium in a +4 valence state include those disclosed in British Pat. No. 2,108,122. herein incorporated herein by reference, which are prepared by reacting zirconium tetraalkoxides with alkanolamines under essentially anhydrous conditions. Other zirconium and titanium crosslinking agents are described, for example, in U.S. Patent Publication No. 20050038199, herein incorporated by reference. Other suitable crosslinking agents are metal ions, metal containing species, or mixture of such ions and species. Such agents include Zn (11), calcium, magnesium, aluminum, Fe (II), and Fe (III). These may be applied directly to the composition as ions or as polyvalent metallic compounds such as hydroxides and chlorides from which the ions may be released.<br>
Where the crosslinkable polymer is guar or hydroxypropyl guar, borate crosslinking agent is preferred.<br>
Especially preferred as crosslinking agents include the crosslinking system disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 5,145,590, herein incorporated by reference. This crosslinking system is a complexor solution of a crosslinking additive and a delay additive which controls the rate at which the crosslinking additive promotes gellation of the crosslinkable polymer. The control rate is a function of the pH of the complexor solution. The crosslinking additive is a material which supplies free borate ions in solution and the delay additive is a material which binds chemically the borate ions in solution, such that the crosslinkable polymer is forced to compete with the delay additive<br><br>
for the free borate ions. As such, the crosslinking additive can be any convenient source of borate ions, for instance the alkali metal and the alkaline earth metal borates boron monoxide and boric acid. A preferred crosslinking additive is sodium borate decahydrate. The delay additive is preferably selected from dialdehydes having about 1 to 4 carbon atoms, keto aldehydes having about 1 to 4 carbon atoms, hydroxyl aldehydes having about 1-4 carbon atoms, ortho substituted aromatic dialdehydes and ortho substituted aromatic hydroxy! aldehydes. The most preferred delay additive is glyoxal. The crosslinking additive is present in a preselected amount to provide a quantity of borate ions or boric acid sufficient to normally over-crosslink the crosslinkable polymer without the presence of the delay additive. The delay additive serves to mask the presence of at least a portion of the borate ions at low temperature, thereby providing a reserve of borate ions for cross-linking the fluid at higher temperatures and provide improved gel stability. Typically, borate compound is present from about 5 to 25% by weight of the complexor solution. The delay additive used in the complexor solution is a material which attempts to bind chemically to the borate ions produced by the cross-linking additive in solution, whereby the hydrated crosslinkable polymer is forced to compete with the delay additive for the borate ions. Preferably, the delay additive is selected from the group consisting of dialdehydes having about 1-4 carbon atoms, keto aldehydes having about 1-4 carbon atoms, hydroxy aldehydes having about 1 to 4 carbon atoms, ortho substituted aromatic dialdehydes and ortho substituted aromatic hydroxy! aldehydes. Preferred delay additives include, for instance, glyoxal, propane dialdehyde, 2-keto propanal, 1,4-butanedial, 2-keto butanal, 2,3-butadione, phthaldehyde, salicaldchyde, etc. The preferred delay additive is glyoxal. Preferably, the delay additive is present in the range from about 5 to 40% by weight of the complexor solution. The preferred ratio of delay additive to crosslinking additive ranges from about 1:0.1 to 1:1 and can approach 1:0.05.<br>
The well treatment fluids defined herein may further include components suitable for modification of the rheological and chemical properties of the fluid. For instance, clayey (clay) materials, such as bentonite, attapulgite or sepiolite may be included in the well treatment fluid, when used as a drilling fluid, to lubricate the drill strings and suspend drill cuttings. The well treatment fluid may also include buffering agents or pH<br><br>
control additives such as sodium phosphate, sodium hydrogen phosphate, boric acid-sodium hydroxide, citric acid-sodium hydroxide, boric acid-borax, sodium bicarbonate, ammonium salts, sodium salts, potassium salts, dibasic phosphate, tribasic phosphate, lime, slaked lime, magnesium oxide, basic magnesium carbonate, calcium oxide and zinc oxide.<br>
As indicated, the described well treatment fluids may be displaced into and used in a wellbore having high downhole temperatures without degradation of the fluid. The sustained viscosity of the well treatment fluid at such downhole temperatures ensures suspension of solids in the fluid as the fluid circulates through the welibore. As such, the well treatment fluids defined herein have particular applicability when used in such well treatment operations as drilling, stimulation, completion, and workover. In a preferred embodiment, the well treatment fluids are used as fracturing fluids in hydraulic fracturing operations.<br>
Further, the well treatment fluid may be effective in stopping or minimizing passage of fluid into a subterranean formation or into a wellbore by the creation of a fluid impermeable barrier. The barrier results upon viscosification of the fluid. Subsequent to its introduction into the wellbore as a pumpable composition, the well treatment fluid viscosifies and thickens into a highly viscous gel. The impermeable barrier reduces or eliminates the loss of wellbore fluid into the wellbore and/or the subterranean formation. After formation of the impermeable barrier, drilling, cementing, completion or workover is resumed. Viscosification of the fluid is inhibited until after the composition is introduced into or near the formation or targeted area. The presence of the crosslinking delay agent allows the well treatment fluid to be easily pumped into the wellbore.<br>
The following examples will illustrate the practice of the present invention in its preferred embodiment. Other embodiments within the scope of the claims herein will be apparent to one skilled in the art from consideration of the specification and practice of the invention as disclosed herein. It is intended that the specification, together with the examples, be considered exemplary only, with the scope and spirit of the invention being indicated by the claims which follow.<br><br>
EXAMPLES<br>
Example 1. A solution was prepared by mixing 0.908 bbl of 12.5 ppg NaBr and 72.7 ppb of 99.9% sodium nitrate. The sodium nitrate completely dissolved and the solution was measure to have a density of 13.12 ppg at 76" F. The crystallization temperature of the fluid was measured to be 60° F.<br>
Example 2. To the solution in Example 1. 40 Ib/Mgal (1.68 ppb) of guar gum was added using an overhead stirrer. The solution reached maximum viscosity at 511 1/sec of 55 cp. in 15 minutes. The fluid without the guar gum had a viscosity of 3.6 cp. at 511 1/sec. The pH of the fluid was raised to 11,2 with 25% by weight NaOH and 0.15 ppb of sodium tetraborodecahydrate was added to crosslink the guar gum. The fluid was then heated to 180" F and the rheologies measured on an OFl Model 900 viscometer at 180° F. The viscosities at shear rates of 1022, 511, 340, 170, 10, 5 1/sec is 85, 120, 169, 278, 1,100 and 1,420 cp., respectively, indicating that the fluid was crosslinked. Comparative Example 3. A brine slurry was prepared containing 40 ppg of guar (commercially available as GW-3LE from BJ Services Company) in 12.5 ppg sodium bromide. The fluid was mixed for 30 minutes using an overhead stirrer. To the fluid was then added, 15.0 gallons per thousand gallons of a potassium containing buffer capable of adjusting the pH of the fluid to a range of about 11.9, commercially available as BF-9L from BJ Services Company; 15.0 gallons per thousand gallons of a borate delayed crosslinking agent {commercially available as XLW-56 from BJ Services Company); and 8.0 pounds per thousand gallons of sodium thiosulfate oxygen scavenger. Thereafter, 45 ml sample of the fluid was placed into a Fann 50 viscometer cup having a bob (BX5) and rotor (Rl) cup assembly. The cup was then placed on a Fann 50 viscometer. The sample was sheared by a rate sweep of 100 sec"' for about 1 minute. The sample was then subjected to different shear rates at varying temperatures. The stresses associated to each rate used in the sweep together with the sweep rate were then used to calculate the power law indices n and K; n refers to flow behavior index and K refers to consistency index set forth in the American Petroleum Institute's Bulletin RP-39. The fluid viscosity was then calculated by using the n and K values, and listed in Table I. The initial linear viscosity was 60 cP at 80° F measured on a Chandler 3500 rheometer having a bob (Bl) and rotor (R1) cup assembly at a rate of sweep of 511 sec"'.<br><br><br>
Example 4. A brine slurry was prepared containing 40 ppg of GW-3LE guar in 13.1 ppg sodium bromide/sodium nitrate and mixed for 30 minutes using an overhead stirrer. To the fluid was then added, 4.5 gallons per thousand gallons of BF-9L, 0.l0 gallons per thousand gallons of BF-IOL. 3.0 gallons per thousand gallons of XLW-56 and 1.0 gallons of a borate crosslinking agent, commercially available from BJ Services Company as XLW-32 was also added along with 8.0 pounds per thousand gallons of sodium thiosulfate oxygen scavenger and 0.50 pounds per thousand gallons of a peroxide delayed release oxidative breaker, commercially available as GBW-24 from BJ Services Company. Thereafter, 65 ml sample of the fluid was placed into a Fann 50 viscometer cup having a bob (BX5) and rotor (Rl) cup assembly fluid viscosity calculated as set forth in Example 3 above. The results are shown in Table II. The initial viscosity was 87 cP at 76° F.<br><br><br><br>
A comparison of Table I with Table II shows a higher viscosity (cP) for the composition coniaij]mg sodium nitrate than the corresponding composition not containing the sodium nitrate and that the fluid retains viscosity for a longer time.<br>
Example 5. A brine slurry was prepared containing 40 ppg of GW-3LE guar in 13.1 ppg sodium bromide/sodium nitrate and mixed for 30 minutes using an overhead stirrer. To the fluid was then added, 15,0 gallons per thousand gallons of BF-9L to adjust die pH of the fluid to a pH of 12.2 and 0.75 gallons per thousand gallons of BF*10L and 7.0 gallons per thousand gallons of XLW-56 and 1.0 gallons of XLW-32. 20.0 pounds per thousand gallons of sodium thiosulfate oxygen scavenger was also added. Thereafter, 45 ml sample of the fluid was placed into a Fann 50 viscometer cup having a bob (BX5) and rotor (Rl) cup assembly fluid viscosity calculated as set forth in Example 3 above. The results are shown in Table III. The initial linear viscosity was 83 cP at 82° F measured on a Chandler 3500 rheometer having a bob (Bl) and rotor (Rl) cup assembly at a rate of sweep of 511 sec'.<br><br>
When compared with Comparative Example 3, the fluid of Example 5 demonstrated enhanced thermal stability and viscosity at higher temperature.<br>
Example 6. Example 5 was repeated except that the brine slurry contained 50 ppg of guar. The calculated viscosity is set forth in Table IV. The initial linear viscosity was 100 cP at 78° F measured on a Chandler 3500 rheometer having a bob (Bl) and rotor (Rl) cup assembly at a rate of sweep of 511 sec' .<br><br><br>
Example 6 demonstrates enhanced thermal stability at increased polymer loading levels. Example 7. The procedure of Example 6 was repeated using 50 ppg polymer loading except that 11.0 ppg sodium bromide/sodium nitrate was used. The fluid contained 15.0 gallons per thousand gallons of BF-9L to adjust the pH of the fluid to a pH of 12.1, 0.10 gallons per thousand gallons of BF-IOL, 7.0 gallons per thousand gallons of XLW-56, 1.0 gallons of XLW-32 and 20.0 pounds per thousand gallons of sodium thiosulfate. The initial linear viscosity was 79 cP at 83° F measured on a Chandler 3500 rheometer having a bob (Bl) and rotor (Rl) cup assembly at a rate of sweep of 511 sec '. The viscosity results are illustrated in Table V.<br><br><br><br>
Table V illustrates enhanced thermal stability in lighter weight brine. Example 8. A brine slurry was prepared containing 50 ppg of GW-3LE guar in 11.0 ppg sodium nitrate brine and mixed for 30 minutes using an overhead stirrer. To the fluid was then added, 15.0 gallons per thousand gallons of BF-9L to adjust the pH of the fluid to a pH of 12.2 and 7.0 gallons per thousand gallons of XLW-56 and 1.0 gallons of XLW-32. 20.0 pounds per thousand gallons of sodium thiosulfaie oxygen scavenger was also added. Fluid viscosity was determined in accordance with the procedure set forth in Example 3 above. The results are shown in Table VI. The initial linear viscosity was 84 cP at 78° F measured on a Chandler 3500 rheometer having a bob (Bl) and rotor (Rl) cup assembly at a rate of sweep of 511 sec-1<br><br><br><br>
Table VI demonstrates that excellent viscosity and thermal stability is obtained by use of a brine containing solely sodium nitrate.<br>
Example 9. A brine slurry was prepared containing 25 ppg of GW-3LE guar in 13.1 ppg sodium bromide/sodium nitrate brine and mixed for 30 minutes using an overhead stirrer. To the fluid was then added, 4,0 gallons per thousand gallons of BF-9L to adjust the pH of the fluid to a pH of 11.4 and 0.10 gallons per thousand gallons of BF-IOL. 1.250 gallons per thousand gallons of XLW-30, a borate ore slurried in hydrocarbon oiJ, a product of BJ Services Company. Thereafter, 45 ml sample of the fluid was placed into a Fann 50 viscometer cup having a bob (BX5) and rotor (Rl) cup assembly fluid viscosity calculated as set forth in Example 3 above. The results are shown in Table VI!. The initial linear viscosity was 40 cP at 73° F measured on a Chandler 3500 rheometer having a bob (Bl) and rotor (Rl) cup assembly at a rate of sweep of 511 sec"'.<br><br><br><br>
Table VII illustrates that use of nitrate brines at lower temperatures allows the application of lower polymer loadings to achieve acceptable viscosity and thermal stability. Example 10. A brine slurry was prepared containing 20 ppg of GW-3LE guar in 13.1 ppg sodium bromide/sodium nitrate brine and mixed for 30 minutes using an overhead stirrer. To the fluid was then added, 5.0 gallons per thousand gallons of BF-9L to adjust the pH of the fluid to a pH of 11.4 and 0.10 gallons per thousand gallons of BF-I0L and 3.0 gallons per thousand gallons of XLW-56 and 1.0 gallons. 0,50 pounds per thousand gallons of GBW-24 was also added. Thereafter, fluid viscosity was determined as set forth in Example 3 above. The results are shown in Table VIII. The initial linear viscosity was 37 cPa( 73° F measured on a Chandler 3500 rheometer having a bob(Bl)<br><br>
Table VIII further illustrates that use of sodium bromide/sodium nitrate brines at lower temperatures allows the application of lower polymer loadings to achieve acceptable viscosity and thermal stability.<br><br>
Comparative Example 11.<br>
A brine slurry was prepared containing 20 ppg of GW-3LE guar in 12.5 ppg sodium bromide and mixed for 30 minutes using an overhead stirrer. To the fluid was then added, 5,0 gallons per thousand gallons of BF-9L to adjust the pH of the fluid to a pH of 11.6 and 0.10 gallons per thousand gallons of BF-IOL and 3.0 gallons per thousand gallons of XLW-56 and 1.0 gallons. 0.50 pounds per thousand gallons of GBW-24 was also added. Thereafter, fluid viscosity was determined as set forth in Example 3 above. The results are shown in Table IX. The initial linear viscosity was 27 cP at 72° F measured on a Chandler 3500 rheometer having a bob (Bl) and rotor (Rl) cup assembly<br><br>
The data of Tables VIII and IX is graphically represented in FIG. 1 and FIG. 2, respectively. The FIGs. show the difference between a sodium bromide brine versus an sodium nitrate/sodium bromide brine. The FIGs. show that the viscosity is maintained over a longer period of time at elevated temperature when a sodium nitrate/sodium bromide brine is used compared to sodium bromide brine.<br>
In light of the enhanced viscosity and thermal stability over time, as demonstrated by the data above, such materials provide an excellent resource in the enhancement of lost circulation materials.<br>
From the foregoing, it will be observed that numerous variations and modifications may be effected without departing from the true spirit and scope of the novel concepts of the invention.<br><br><br>
