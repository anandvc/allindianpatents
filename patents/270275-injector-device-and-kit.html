				<td>AUTOMATIC RECONSTITUTION INJECTOR DEVICE<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0001]	This invention relates to self-injection drug delivery devices that automatically<br>
reconstitute a dry drug into liquid form.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002]	Medication delivery pens have been developed to facilitate the administration of<br>
medication, particularly the self-administration of medication. Such medication delivery pens may<br>
be referred to herein as an injector device, a self-injection drug delivery device, a pen style drug<br>
delivery device, a pen, and other variations thereof. Such pens may be disposable, containing a<br>
single dose of a drug, or reusable, containing a single dose or more of a drug. The pen typically<br>
includes a vial or drug cartridge containing a drug and a dose setting mechanism which allows both<br>
for selecting a dose of medication to be delivered by the pen and for urging a plunger of the vial in a<br>
distal direction for a distance corresponding to the selected dose, thereby allowing the dose to be<br>
administered.<br>
[0003]	Certain drugs or medicaments (those terms being used interchangeably herein) are<br>
preferably provided in powder or dry form (sometimes referred to a lyophilized form), and require<br>
reconstitution prior to administration. Lyophilized drugs, for example, typically are supplied in a<br>
freeze-dried form that needs to be mixed with a diluent to reconstitute the substance into a form that<br>
is suitable for injection. Medicaments may also be provided in other powder form that require<br>
reconstitution.<br>
2<br><br>
[0004]	Prior art devices have been developed that provide the diluent and lyophilized<br>
substance in separate chambers of a common container. Such devices permit manual reconstitution<br>
of the drug prior to administration. U.S. Patents No. 4,874,381 to Vetter and U.S. Patent No.<br>
4,968,299 to Ahlstrand et al. are examples of manually activated devices which require a user to<br>
physically move one or more components to perform a reconstitution process. U.S. Patent No.<br>
6,793,646 to Giambattista et al. shows a device which allows for automated reconstitution.<br>
Specifically, to activate the device and effect reconstitution of the dry drug, the user manually<br>
causes certain components to move relative to one another axially to obtain reconstitution of a<br>
medication. The device of U.S. Patent No. 6,793,646, however, is a single dose device which is<br>
disposable, not reusable. In addition, the device has limited variation in deliverable dosage<br>
amounts, based on a fixed arrangement of parts.<br>
[0005]	Certain drugs, once reconstituted, may have a shelf-life of several days or months.<br>
For example, human growth hormone (HGH) may have a shelf-life of up to thirty (30) days once<br>
reconstituted. For. such drugs, it may be desirable to have a device which enables the user to<br>
administer repeated dosing of varying volumes of reconstituted drugs or medicaments, thus<br>
allowing for multiple doses to be administered over time.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0006]	The present invention is directed to an automatic reconstitution drug delivery device.<br>
The inventive device effects simple and automatic reconstitution of a dry drug. To effect<br>
reconstitution, a user displaces a release button which causes first and second chambers of a drug<br>
cartridge to communicate, resulting in automatic mixing of a diluent and dry drug to effect<br>
3<br><br>
reconstitution of the dry drug. The user then simply sets the dose volume using a dose-setting<br>
mechanism, and administers the injection in a manner typical of self-injection drug delivery devices.<br>
Whole or partial automatic priming can be also achieved by the device.<br>
[0007]	In a further aspect of the subject invention, an injector device for automatic<br>
reconstitution of a substance is provided herein having a dose-setting mechanism with a cartridge<br>
engagement surface extending therefrom. The dose-setting mechanism is adjustable to set a dose<br>
for the injector device. The injector device further includes a housing cooperatively engaging the<br>
dose-setting mechanism, and a biasing means for selectively moving the dose-setting mechanism<br>
from a first position to a second position relative to the housing. The cartridge engagement surface<br>
moves a predetermined distance relative to the housing with the dose-setting mechanism moving<br>
from the first position to the second position. Advantageously, the subject invention allows for the<br>
dose-setting mechanism to be moved relative to the housing to cause automatic reconstitution of a<br>
drug substance. The force of movement of the cartridge engagement surface is translated to a multi-<br>
chambered drug cartridge which, in turn, may utilize the force of movement to cause reconstitution<br>
of the contents of the drug cartridge using any known technique.<br>
[0008]	Various dose-setting mechanisms can be used with the subject invention. In<br>
addition, various features can be optionally used with the injector device, such as, a releasable<br>
attachment for the drug cartridge, and a releasable retainer for maintaining the dose-setting<br>
mechanism in the first position against the biasing means.<br>
[0009]	The injector device may also be included as part of a kit which further includes a<br>
mandrel for setting the dose-setting mechanism to the first position from the second position.<br>

[0010]	These and other features of the invention will be better understood through a study<br>
of the following detailed description and accompanying drawings.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0027]	With reference to Figure 1, an automatic reconstitution injector device 10 in<br>
accordance with an embodiment of the present invention is there depicted. The inventive injector<br>
device 10 may be used to administer one or more injections of a drug or a medicament. The injector<br>
device 10 generally includes a dose-setting mechanism 12, a housing 14, and a drug cartridge<br>
assembly 16.<br>
[0028]	As used herein, the term "proximal", and derivatives thereof, refer to a direction<br>
towards the rear of the injector body and away from a patient, while the term "distal", and<br><br>
derivatives thereof, refer to a direction towards the front of the injector device and closer to a<br>
patient.<br>
[0029]	The drug cartridge assembly 16 includes a drug cartridge or vial 216 that may be<br>
formed of any known material, such as glass or plastic. By way of non-limiting example, and with<br>
reference to Figures 10 and 11, the drug cartridge 216 includes a distal end 18 with an opening 20<br>
formed therein sealed by a pierceable septum 22. As is known in the art, the septum 22 is<br>
pierceable by a needle cannula 23 and re-sealable upon removal of the needle cannula 23.<br>
Typically, the needle cannula 23 will be double-ended with both ends being sharpened, a proximal<br>
end 25 for piercing the septum 22 and a distal end 27 for insertion into a patient. The drug cartridge<br>
216 further includes a proximal end 24 which is open and sealable by a first stopper 26 that is<br>
movably disposed in the drug cartridge 216 to slide along the length thereof and maintain a seal<br>
with the wall of the drug cartridge 216. The first stopper 26 is engageable by the dose-setting<br>
mechanism 12, directly or indirectly, to force movement thereof.<br>
[0030]	The drug cartridge 216 may be a multi-chambered cartridge including at least first<br>
and second chambers for containing a first and second liquid or dry substance. For example, a<br>
reconstitutable substance, e.g. a lyophilized substance, may be disposed in one chamber with a<br>
diluent suitable for reconstituting the reconstitutable substance being disposed in a separate, second<br>
chamber. Reconstitution is achieved with communication being allowed between the two<br>
chambers. Various configurations are known in the art to selectively permit communication. By<br>
way of non-limiting example, and again with reference to Figure 10, a second stopper 28 may be<br>
disposed in the drug cartridge 216 spaced from the first stopper 26 in an initial state. Accordingly, a<br>
-7-<br><br>
fust chamber 30 is defined between the first and second stoppers 26,28, and a second chamber 32 is<br>
defined between the second stopper 28 and the septum 22 at the distal end 18 of the drug cartridge<br>
216. A dry, reconstitutable substance 34 may be disposed in the second chamber 32, while a diluent<br>
36 suitable for reconstituting the reconstitutable substance 34 may be disposed in the first chamber<br>
30. In the initial state, the second stopper 28 prevents communication between the first and second<br>
chambers 30,32 during transportation and up to reconstitution, which, preferably occurs just before<br>
administration. With the exemplary configuration, to achieve reconstitution, the first stopper 26 is<br>
caused to be driven distally with the second stopper 28 moving in response to the force of<br>
movement of the first stopper 26. The force of movement may be translated to the second stopper<br>
28 via the diluent 36 with the diluent 36 being generally incompressible. One or more<br>
communication channels 38 may be formed in the wall of the drug cartridge 216 adapted to by-pass<br>
the second stopper 28 over a range of movement of the second stopper 28. With the second stopper<br>
28 moving a sufficient distance, the communication channel 38 establishes communication between<br>
the first and second chambers 30,32. The communication channel 38 has sufficient length to<br>
permit communication between the first and second chambers 30,32 about the second stopper 28.<br>
With the first and second chambers 30,32 being in open communication, the diluent 36 is urged<br>
into the second chamber 32 with further distal movement of the first stopper 26. With continued<br>
movement, the first stopper 26 collapses the first chamber 30 and comes into contact with the<br>
second stopper 28 (Figure 11). The reconstitution process is terminated with further movement of<br>
the second stopper 28, under force of movement of the first stopper 26, to a position where the<br>
second chamber 32, and reconstituted substance 37, is sealed from the communication channel 38.<br>
With the needle cannula 23 extending through the septum 22 into communication with the second<br>
8<br><br>
chamber 32, additional movement of the first stopper 26 can urge the reconstituted substance 37<br>
from the second chamber 32 and into the needle cannula 23 for administration.<br>
[0031]	As will be recognized by those skilled in the art, various drug cartridges and<br>
container designs exist which allow for selective communication between initially-separate<br>
chambers in permitting reconstitution of a drag or medicament. Alternative communication<br>
passages and arrangements can be utilized with the subject invention including specially designed<br>
stoppers or valve mechanisms, such as those shown in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,713,857 and 4,929,230,<br>
the disclosures of which are both incorporated by reference herein. In addition, more than two<br>
chambers may be used as shown in U.S. Patent No. 5,865,798 depending on the particular substance<br>
to be reconstituted. As will be further appreciated by those skilled in the art, any reconstitutable<br>
substance may be used with subject invention, such as a drag or medicament in powdered form<br>
which is not lyophilized.<br>
[0032]	The needle cannula 23 is preferably fixed relative to the housing 14. Li particular,<br>
the needle cannula 23 is fixed to the housing 14 so that there is no relative movement therebetween<br>
during the reconstitution process or otherwise. The needle cannula 23 may be fixed using any<br>
known manner, such as being threadedly mounted or being rigidly staked to the drug cartridge<br>
assembly 16. Alternatively, or in addition to, the needle cannula 23 may be directly fixed to the<br>
housing 14. It may be desired to have the needle cannula 23 be removably fixed to allow for<br>
replacement and multiple uses with the same drag cartridge 216, or permanently fixed, such as<br>
where the injector device 10 is intended as a single-use device.<br>
9<br><br>
[0033]	With reference to Figure 2, the housing 14 may include a front housing 40 and a rear<br>
housing 42 which are joinable using any known technique, including, but not limited to, an<br>
interference fit, bonding, and/or mechanical interaction of locking members. The front housing 40<br>
defines an open distal end 44 of the injector device 10, while the rear housing 42 defines an open<br>
proximal end 46 of the injector device 10. The housing 14 is formed to accommodate the dose-<br>
setting mechanism 12 with a portion of the dose-setting mechanism 12 being accessible through the<br>
proximal end 46.<br>
[0034]	The dose-setting mechanism 12 may be of any known pen-type dose mechanism<br>
which is adjustable and preferably allows for repeated and consecutive setting of variable-volume<br>
doses and administration thereof. Preferably, the dose-setting mechanism 12 includes a cartridge<br>
engagement surface 57 extending therefrom (Figure 3). Preferably, the cartridge engagement<br>
surface 57 is defined on the distalmost portion of the dose-setting mechanism 12, such as the<br>
distalmost portion of a leadscrew 56 extending from the dose-setting mechanism 12. Leadscrew-<br>
type dose-setting mechanisms provide for highly accurate and repeatable dose setting and dose<br>
administration of varying volumes.<br>
[0035]	It is preferred that the dose-setting mechanism 12 be a self-contained unit within the<br>
housing 14. In this manner, an "off-the-shelf" dose-setting mechanism can be utilized. With<br>
reference to Figure 3, an exemplary configuration of a dose-setting mechanism 12 is shown. This<br>
dose-setting mechanism is generally the same as that disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 6,248,095, the<br>
disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein. In addition to the leadscrew 56, the dose-<br>
setting mechanism 12 may include a spinner 58, a retract nut 60, a body 62, a lens 64, a reset ring<br>
10<br><br>
66, a dose set knob 68, a driver 70, and a thumb button 78. The specific configuration and<br>
interaction of these elements is discussed in U.S. Patent No. 6,248,095.<br>
[0036]	The dose-setting mechanism 12 may additionally include a spring retainer 72, a<br>
spring 74, and a spring cap 76. The spring 74 may act as a spacer to ensure that the cartridge<br>
engagement surface 57 is located to have sufficient distal movement to cause reconstitution and,<br>
optionally initial priming, as described below. In other words, the spring 74 locates the initial start<br>
position of the cartridge engagement surface 57 (e.g., by locating the initial start position of the<br>
leadscrew 56) and prevents excessive movement proximally of the cartridge engagement surface 57.<br>
In addition, the spring 74 acts as a damper upon re-setting of the dose-setting mechanism 12 where<br>
the leadscrew 56 is forced proximally to the start position. The spring 74 cushions the return force.<br>
The spring retainer 72 and the spring cap 76 act to hold the spring 74 in place by providing end<br>
point contacts. As an alternative, the spring 74 can be replaced with a resilient tube 73, such as a<br>
silicone tube, as shown in Figure 3a. Proximal end 75 of the leadscrew 56 can be provided with a<br>
protruding finger 77 for holding one end of the resilient tube 73, while a separate holder 79 can be<br>
provided for holding the other end of the resilient tube 73. The spring cap 76 can be provided as<br>
support for the holder 79. The resilient tube 73 provides the same functions as the spring 74 in<br>
cushioning the re-set force and acting as a dimensional spacer.<br>
[0037]	As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, other dose-setting mechanisms can<br>
be utilized with the subject invention, including various combinations of features of dose-setting<br>
mechanisms. For example, U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2004/0199117 Al, which<br>
published on October 7,2004, shows a "dial-back" feature which allows the user to freely correct a<br>
11<br><br>
dose without having to reset the dose-setting mechanism. In addition, U.S. Patent Application<br>
Publication No. 2004/0127858 Al, which published on July 1,2004, shows a device having a<br>
limiter which prevents setting a dose that is greater than the available medication. Hie disclosures<br>
of these two publications are incorporated by reference herein in their respective entireties.<br>
[0038]	The dose-setting mechanism 12 is preferably formed to be re-usable (i.e., formed to<br>
be used consecutively with multiple drug cartridges or drug cartridge assemblies). It is, thus,<br>
preferred that the cartridge engagement surface 57 be re-settable to a start position after the dose-<br>
setting mechanism 12 has been used. It should be noted that all or a portion of the cartridge<br>
engagement surface 57 may be defined on a distal face of the spinner 58.<br>
[0039]	By way of non-limiting example, with the configuration of the dose-setting<br>
mechanism 12 described above, the leadscrew 56, which defines the cartridge engagement surface<br>
57, extends through the retract nut 60, and the retract nut 60 interacts with the body 62 to preferably<br>
selectively permit rotation of the leadscrew 56. With the leadscrew 56 being non-rotatably held by<br>
the retract nut 60 relative to the dose-setting mechanism 12, the leadscrew 56 can be translated<br>
axially in a distal direction to allow for dose administration. With the retract nut 60 being rotatable,<br>
the leadscrew 56 is also rotatable and re-settable in a proximal direction to the start position.<br>
Alternatively, the dose-setting mechanism 12 may be a single-use device which is discarded with<br>
the completion of a single use, typically, coinciding with the completion of a single drug cartridge.<br>
Here, the leadscrew 56 need not be re-settable and can be non-rotatably held in the dose-setting<br>
mechanism 12 (e.g., by not permitting rotation of the retract nut 60).<br>
12<br><br>
[0040]	As shown in Figures 2 and 3, a body adapter 48, a release ting 50, a plunger 52, and,<br>
optionally, a locking ring 54 are mountable onto the dose-setting mechanism 12. With reference to<br>
Figures 4a and b, the body adapter 48 includes a shaft portion 80 defining a lumen 82 for<br>
accommodating the plunger 52. Preferably, a slot 84 is formed in the wall of the shaft portion 80<br>
which is generally straight and parallel to the longitudinal axis of the shaft portion 80, and an angled<br>
guide member 86 (Figure 3) protrudes from the plunger 52 formed to extend into the slot 84 with<br>
the plunger 52 being disposed in the lumen 82. The guide member 86 slides along Hie axial length<br>
of the slot 84 with movement of the plunger 52, and the interengagement of the slot 84 and the<br>
guide member 86 prevents rotation of the plunger 52 relative to the shaft portion 80.<br>
[0041]	The body adapter 48 further includes a flange 88 which extends radially outwardly<br>
from the shaft portion 80. A retaining wall 90 extends from the flange 88 opposite the shaft portion<br>
80. The retaining wall 90 is formed to be fixed to a distal end 92 of the body 62 (Figure 3) which<br>
also defines a distal end of the dose-setting mechanism 12. The fixing may be of any known type,<br>
including an interference fit, bonding, and/or mechanical interaction of locking members. It is<br>
preferred that the body adapter 48 be fixed to the dose-setting mechanism 12 such that the two<br>
elements may move in concert during operation of the injector device 10. It is further preferred that<br>
the body adapter 48 be attached to the dose-setting mechanism 12 so that there is no relative rotation<br>
therebetween.<br>
[0042]	The lumen 82, at the flange 88, is formed to allow passage thereinto of the leadscrew<br>
56 and, optionally, the spinner 58. The leadscrew 56 engages the plunger 52 within the shaft<br>
portion 80. The plunger 52 acts to translate force of movement applied thereto by the cartridge<br>
/3<br><br>
engagement surface 57 to the drug cartridge 216. The plunger 52 can be formed of different lengths<br>
to accommodate various lengths of the dose-setting mechanism 12 and the drug cartridge 216. With<br>
sufficient length of the plunger 52, proper and full reconstitution can be achieved. In addition,<br>
proper initial priming can be achieved. As an alternative, the cartridge engagement surface 57 can<br>
directly engage the drug cartridge 216, without the use of the plunger 52.<br>
[0043]	With reference to Figure 2, a biasing means 94, preferably a spring, is disposed in<br>
the housing 14 to urge the dose-setting mechanism 12 from an initial, first position to a second<br>
position relative to the housing 14. It is preferred that the biasing means 94 be a coil spring which is<br>
sized to pass over the dose-setting mechanism 12 and to have a distal end 95 engage the flange 88 of<br>
the body adapter 48. With this arrangement, buckling and other sideward displacement of the<br>
biasing means 94 may be limited. A proximal end 96 of the biasing means 94 may be disposed to<br>
act against the housing 14. Alternatively, and with the preferred arrangement, a spring seat 98 is<br>
provided which is shaped and sized to be accommodated within the rear^housing 42. Preferably, the<br>
spring seat 98 is non-rotatably fixed in the rear housing 42. The spring seat 98 includes a bearing<br>
surface 100 for engagement against the proximal end 96 of the biasing means 94.<br>
[0044]	A cut-out 102 may be formed in the spring seat 98 to match a cut-out 104 formed in<br>
the rear housing 42. The cut-outs 102,104 are axially alignable to permit a user to view the lens 64<br>
of the dose-setting mechanism 12 in setting a dosage amount on the dose-setting mechanism 12.<br>
The lens 64 permits visual inspection of the dose setting. Dose indicia may be provided on the dose<br>
set knob 68 which are viewable through the lens 64. As shown in Figure 5, the spring seat 98 is<br><br>
tubular and includes a passageway 110 therethrough sized to accommodate the dose-setting<br>
mechanism 12.<br>
[0045]	Preferably, the dose-setting mechanism 12 is retained in the first position against the<br>
force of the biasing means 94. It addition, it is preferred that the dose-setting mechanism 12 be<br>
retained in the first position until released by a trigger. Although any known retaining arrangement<br>
and any known trigger configuration are usable with the subject invention, a representative<br>
arrangement is depicted and described herein. As shown in Figure 6, a plurality of inwardly-<br>
extending ribs 112 may be disposed along a limited longitudinal length of the interior of the rear<br>
housing 42. The flange 88 of the body adapter 48 defines a profile slidable through the interior of<br>
the rear housing 42 with slots 114 being formed on the flange 88 corresponding to the number, size<br>
and location of the ribs 112 (Figure 4b). As such, the flange 88 may slide through the rear housing<br>
42 over the ribs 112. Rotation of the flange 88 relative to the rear housing 42 is not desired and the<br>
slots 114 may be formed to limit such.<br>
[0046]	With the dose-setting mechanism 12 being in the first position, the release ring 50 is<br>
interposed between the flange 88 and the ribs 112. With reference to Figure 7a, the release ring 50<br>
includes a comparable profile to the flange 88, with release slots 116 being formed that are<br>
comparably formed and arranged as the slots 114 of the flange 88. In the first position of the dose-<br>
setting mechanism 12, the release ring 50 is positioned to have the release slots 116 out of alignment<br>
with the ribs 112 of the rear housing 42. With this arrangement, force of the biasing means 94<br>
against the flange 88 is transmitted to the release ring 50. However, the interengagement of the<br>
release ring 50 and the ribs 112 counteracts the force and prevents movement of the flange 88. For<br>
activation, the release ring 50 is caused to rotate to align the release slots 116 with the ribs 112. As<br>
15<br><br>
such, the counteraction against the force of the biasing means 94 is removed and the biasing means<br>
94 may urge the flange 88, along with the body adapter 48 and the dose-setting mechanism 12, from<br>
the first position.<br>
[0047]	The release ring 50 may be caused to rotate in any known manner. For example, a<br>
displaceable release button 118 may be provided which is movably attached to the rear housing 42<br>
(Figure 2). With reference to Figure 8, the release button 118 is provided with an angled actuation<br>
surface 120. In an initial state, the actuation surface 120 is positioned to be axially aligned, but<br>
preferably spaced from, an angled engagement surface 122 formed on the release ring 50 (Figure<br>
7b). As shown in Figure 9, with linear displacement of the actuation surface 120 and engagement<br>
with the engagement surface 122, the engagement surface 122 is caused to move transversely and<br>
create a torque about the release ring 50. This torque results in rotation of the release ring 50. To<br>
ensure linear translation of the actuation surface 120, the release button 118 is formed to slide along<br>
fixed button slot 124 formed through the rear housing 42. Preferably, release button spring 126 is<br>
provided to urge the release button 118 to its initial state, with me actuation surface 120 being<br>
spaced from the engagement surface 122. To facilitate handling, outer surface 128 of the release<br>
button 118 may be textured to enhance its gripability. As will be appreciated by those skilled in the<br>
art, the extent of rotation of the release ring 50 may be controlled by the extent of interengagement<br>
of the actuation surface 120 and the engagement surface 122 and the angles of the respective<br>
surfaces. The extent of rotation required to align the release slots 116 with the ribs 112 may be<br>
achieved by varying these factors.<br>
16<br><br>
[0048]	It is necessary to have the slots 114 of the flange 88 be axially aligned with the ribs<br>
112 with the release ring 50 maintaining the dose-setting mechanism 12 in the first position. If the<br>
slots 114 are not axially aligned with the ribs 112, the flange 88 may not pass through the rear<br>
housing 42 and proper movement of the dose-setting mechanism 12 may be prevented. Therefore,<br>
it is preferred that the spring seat 98 be formed with one or more channels 106 radially spaced about<br>
its interior (Figure 5). Preferably, two of the channels 106 are provided. The channels 106 are<br>
spaced and formed to accommodate positioning ribs 108 which extend from the periphery of the<br>
dose-setting mechanism 12. As shown in Figure 3, the positioning ribs 108 may protrude from the<br>
body 62. The channels 106 and the positioning ribs 108 are located to interengage with the dose-<br>
setting mechanism 12 being in the first position. In addition, the channels 106 and the positioning<br>
ribs 108 are located to axially align the slots 114 with the ribs 112. In this manner, with the release<br>
ring 50 permitting movement of the dose-setting mechanism 12, as described above, the slots 114<br>
are positioned to slide over the ribs 112. The interengagement of the channels 106 and the<br>
positioning ribs 108 also prevents rotation of the dose-setting mechanism 12 with the housing 14. It<br>
is further preferred that the channels 106 and the positioning ribs 108 have sufficient lengths to<br>
maintain interengagement with the slots 114 initially passing over the ribs 112. As the flange 88<br>
moves distally, the channels 106 and the positioning ribs 108 will disengage.<br>
[0049]	Figures 10 and 11 illustrate operation of the injector device 10. Initially, the drug<br>
cartridge assembly 16 is inserted through the distal end 44 and attached to the injector device 10.<br>
Preferably, the first position of the dose-setting mechanism 12 corresponds to a position which<br>
allows the housing 14 to accommodate the drug cartridge 216 being in a full state. As shown in<br>
Figure 10, with the drag cartridge 216 being in a full state, the first stopper 26 is located adjacent to<br>
17<br><br>
the proximal end 24. With the drag cartridge assembly 16 being secured to the housing 14, distal<br>
end 130 of the plunger 52 is positioned to engage the first stopper 26. To ensure a good connection<br>
therebetween, the distal end 130 may have a protrusion 132 formed for insertion into a recess 134 in<br>
the first stopper 26. In addition, with the first position, the biasing means 94 is compressed and the<br>
release ring 50 is in a state of retaining the dose-setting mechanism 12, as described above. As can<br>
be seen in Figure 10, a substantial portion of the dose-setting mechanism 12 extends through the<br>
proximal end 46 of the injector device 10.<br>
[0050]	To cause activation, the release button 118 is displaced relative to the housing 14,<br>
resulting in the first and second chambers 30,32 coming into communication. With the preferred<br>
trigger arrangement, displacement of the release button US causes the release ring 50 to rotate as<br>
described above. This rotation may be achieved through displacement of the release button 118 to<br>
its actuation state. As shown in Figure 11, with the release ring 50 permitting the dose-setting<br>
mechanism 12 to move from the first position, the biasing means 94 urges the dose-setting<br>
mechanism 12 distally into a second position. The second position is defined by a stop surface 136<br>
within the housing 14. During movement of the dose-setting mechanism 12 from the first position<br>
to the second position, the cartridge engagement surface 57 moves across a predetermined distance<br>
which, in turn, causes the first stopper 26 to move. The cartridge engagement surface 57, however,<br>
does not move relative to the dose-setting mechanism 12 with the dose-setting mechanism 12<br>
moving from the first position to the second position. Movement of the first stopper 26 can cause<br>
reconstitution of a drug substance (e.g., lyophilized substance 34) located in the drug cartridge 216,<br>
as described above. It is preferred that the second position be defined so that the predetermined<br>
distance the cartridge engagement surface 57 traverses is sufficient to allow for reconstitution of the<br>
18<br><br>
drug substance within the drag cartridge 216. For example, the predetermined distance is sufficient<br>
to urge the second stopper 28 into a position sealing the second chamber 32 from the<br>
communication channel 38 at the end of the reconstitution process. The predetermined distance can<br>
be provided with additional length beyond that necessary for the reconstitution process to initiate,<br>
and even to complete, initial priming of the injector device 10. Initial priming can also be achieved<br>
by manual operation of the dose-setting mechanism 12 after reconstitution.<br>
[0051]	During the course of reconstitution, it is preferred that the needle cannula 23 be<br>
mounted to the drug cartridge assembly 16 and/or to the housing 14 to act as a vent and permit any<br>
trapped gases to escape from the second chamber 32. The rate of venting will affect the rate of<br>
reconstitution. In particular, a smaller gauge needle cannula 23 will provide a higher level of<br>
resistance against movement of the dose-setting mechanism 12 during reconstitution, and, thus, will<br>
provide a slower rate of reconstitution than a larger gauge needle cannula. In addition, the spring<br>
constant of the biasing means 94 may be selected to affect the rate of reconstitution, as well as,<br>
adjustment of surface interfaces which generate frictional forces resisting the force applied to<br>
achieve reconstitution (e.g., frictional forces between the first stopper 26 and the drug cartridge 216<br>
can be adjusted by selection of materials or providing lubricant therebetween).<br>
[0052]	As an alternative, the injector device 10 can be configured to cause reconstitution<br>
without the needle cannula 23 being mounted thereto. Here, the spring force of the biasing means<br>
94 can be selected so as to provide sufficient force to compress any air trapped in the chambers 30,<br>
32 and to force the diluent 36 into the second chamber 32. Without venting, the reconstituted<br>
substance 37 will be pressurized in the second chamber 32. Upon mounting the needle cannula 23,<br>
19<br><br>
the needle cannula 23 will vent the second chamber 32, thereby releasing the trapped pressure and<br>
forcing the reconstituted substance 37 into the needle cannula 23. This process may partially or<br>
completely achieve initial priming. Full priming can be manually achieved by manual operation of<br>
the dose-setting mechanism 12. In addition, the elements of the injector device 10 can be selected<br>
and configured so that equilibrium between the pressurized reconstituted substance 37 and the<br>
spring force of the biasing means 94 can be achieved with (he dose-setting mechanism 12 being in<br>
its second position. In this case, upon mounting the needle cannula 23 and venting the second<br>
chamber 32, the pressure in the second chamber 32 will be released. The biasing means 94 may be<br>
configured to urge the dose-setting mechanism 12 to a third position. Movement to the third<br>
position may cause full and automatic initial priming.<br>
[0053]	The drug cartridge assembly 16 may be initially provided with a removable cap 138<br>
for covering the opening 20 during shipment The cap 138 is removable to allow for mounting of<br>
the needle cannula 23.<br>
[0054]	With me dose-setting mechanism 12 being in the second position as shown in Figure<br>
11, and the reconstituted substance 37 being disposed in the second chamber 32, the dose-setting<br>
mechanism 12 can be adjusted to select a desired dose of particular volume. With the desired dose<br>
being set, the dose-setting mechanism 12 may be actuated which results in the cartridge engagement<br>
surface 57 being moved distally relative to the dose-setting mechanism 12, a distance corresponding<br>
to the volume of the desired dose. In turn, the first stopper 26 moves the corresponding distance.<br>
This movement results in the desired dose being expelled from the second chamber 32 via the<br>
needle cannula 23. Dosing may be repeated as needed with varying volumes being provided.<br>
20<br><br>
[0055]	Upon depletion of the contents of the drag cartridge 216, the drug cartridge<br>
assembly 16 may be separated from the housing 14 and discarded. If the injector device 10 is a<br>
single-use type, the injector device 10 may be discarded also with the drug cartridge assembly 16.<br>
If the injector 10 is re-usable, the dose-setting mechanism 12 is returned to the first position, and the<br>
leadscrew 56 is reset to its initial position, as discussed below.<br>
[0056]	Optionally, a releasable attachment may be provided for securing the drug cartridge<br>
assembly 16 to the housing 14. In this manner, the injector device 10 may be re-usable with<br>
replacement of a spent drug cartridge 216. For example, one or more cartridge release buttons 140<br>
may be formed to be releasably attached to the drug cartridge assembly 16 to the housing 14. It is<br>
preferred that two of the release buttons 140 be provided and located at diametrically opposed<br>
locations on the housing 14 to provide even holding force for the drug cartridge assembly 16. With<br>
reference to Figures 11 and 12, the cartridge release buttons 140 are displaceable between release<br>
and locking positions. In a locking position (Figure 11), each of the cartridge release buttons 140 is<br>
positioned to interferingly engage a protrusion 144 extending from the drug cartridge assembly 16<br>
upon distal movement of the drug cartridge assembly 16 relative to the housing 14, thereby<br>
inhibiting separation of the drag cartridge assembly 16 from the housing 14. In particular, a distal<br>
end 142 of the cartridge release button 140 is positioned to interferingly engage the protrusion 144.<br>
The protrusions 144 may be formed with various configurations but are preferably cylindrical so<br>
that precise axial alignment of the protrusions 144 and the cartridge release buttons 140 may be<br>
avoided. Slots 141 may be provided to guide the protrusions 144 to the cartridge release buttons<br>
140 and ensure sufficient axial alignment therebetween for locking engagement. The slots 141<br>
extend from the distal end 44 of the front housing 40 (Figure 2).<br>
21<br><br>
[0057]	In a release position as shown in Figure 12, each of the cartridge release buttons 140<br>
does not interferingly engage the protrusion 144 upon distal movement of the drug cartridge<br>
assembly 16 relative to the housing 14, thereby facilitating separation of the drug cartridge assembly<br>
16 from the housing 14. The distal ends 142 may be provided each with a shoulder 143 or other<br>
cut-out to provide an engaging surface against the protrusion 144. Preferably, the shoulder 143 is<br>
disposed generally perpendicularly to the distal direction of movement of the drug cartridge<br>
assembly 16.<br>
[0058]	Preferably, each of the cartridge release buttons 142 is pivotally mounted to the front<br>
housing 40 to permit displacement. Two openings 148,150 are defined on the sides of a cross-<br>
piece 146 in the front housing 40. The cartridge release button 142 includes a notch 145 for pivotal<br>
engagement with the cross-piece 146. The cartridge release button 142 is disposed interiorly of the<br>
rear housing 40 with the notch 145 being below the cross-piece 146. The first opening 148 permits<br>
access to depress a proximal end 152 of the cartridge release button 142. Upon being depressed, the<br>
cartridge release button 140 pivots about the cross-piece 146 with Ihe distal end 142 moving away<br>
from the drug cartridge 16 to the release position.<br>
[0059]	Preferably, a deflectable spring 154 is provided to urge each of the cartridge release<br>
buttons 140 to its locking position. In particular, the spring 154 is positioned to bias the proximal<br>
end 152 of the cartridge release button 140 away from the drug cartridge assembly 16. To facilitate<br>
mounting of the spring 154 within the housing 14, a front housing shell 156 may be provided which<br>
is mountable into the front housing 40 and provides support for the springs 154. The shell 156 is<br>
formed with an interior to accommodate the drug cartridge assembly 16. Channels 158 are formed<br>
22<br><br>
through the shell 156 to allow the cartridge release buttons 140 to extend therethrough and engage<br>
the drug cartridge assembly 16. A stop arm 157 may extend from the cartridge release button 140<br>
to engage a portion of the shell 156. This engagement limits rotation of the cartridge release button<br>
140 under force of the spring 154. An internal stop surface (not shown) may also be provided on<br>
the shell 156 to limit proximal insertion of the drug cartridge 16 thereinto. In addition, the stop<br>
surface 136 may be defined on a proximal end 160 of the shell 156 to define the second position of<br>
the dose-setting mechanism 12. The shell 156 is fixed to the first housing 40 using any known<br>
technique.<br>
[0060]	It is further preferred that the distal end 142 be formed with a tapered or rounded end<br>
162. With proximal movement of the drug cartridge assembly 16 into the housing 14 during<br>
insertion thereof, the protrusion 144 engages the distal end 142 and may force the cartridge release<br>
button 140 in its release position, thus, allowing the protrusion 144 to pass thereby. With the<br>
protrusion 144 passing thereby, the cartridge release button 140 returns to its locking position. To<br>
allow a user visual inspection of the inserted drug cartridge, an aperture 164 may be formed through<br>
each of the cartridge release buttons 140. Together with the opening 150 and the channel 158, the<br>
aperture 164 provides visual access to the drug cartridge assembly 16 in an attached position.<br>
Locking means for preventing inadvertent detachment of the drug cartridge assembly 216 may be<br>
provided for the cartridge release buttons 140. For example, the locking means may be required to<br>
be unlocked to permit detachment of the drug cartridge assembly 216.<br>
[0061]	As described above, and as a further optional feature, the injector device 10 may<br>
include a feature for selectively preventing rotation of the leadscrew 56. With this feature, the<br>
23<br><br>
leadsciew 56 may be prepared for actuation and be allowed to be re-set With reference to the<br>
exemplary configuration of the dose-setting mechanism 12 described above, selective prevention of<br>
rotation of the leadscrew 56 can be achieved where the retract nut 60 is caused to be selectively non-<br>
rotatably fixed and released depending on circumstances. With the injector device 10, one or more<br>
tabs 166 (Figure 3) may be formed in the body 62 to non-rotatably hold the retract nut 60, as<br>
described in U.S. Patent No. 6,248,095. The tabs 166, however, require inward deflection to be<br>
activated. To achieve such inward deflection, the locking ring 54 is provided with an annular body<br>
168 formed to slide onto the distal end 92 of the body 62 and over the tabs 166, thereby causing<br>
inward deflection thereof. It is desired that the locking ring 54 cause inward deflection of the tabs<br>
166 with the dose-setting mechanism 12 being in the second position. This allows for the retract nut<br>
60 to be not rotatable in the second position of the dose-setting mechanism 12, with the leadscrew<br>
56 also not being rotatable and the leadscrew 56 being drivable distally to cause a dosage<br>
administration.<br>
[0062]	It is also desired to have the annular body 168 be disengaged from the tabs 166 with<br>
the dose-setting mechanism 12 being in the first position. As such, this arrangement permits<br>
rotation of the leadscrew 56 and re-setting thereof to an initial position. This would also prevent use<br>
of the dose-setting mechanism 12 in the first position, prior to reconstitution.<br>
[0063]	To allow for selective engagement and disengagement of the locking ring 54, legs<br>
170 are provided which extend from the annular body 168 and are formed to pass through passages<br>
172 in the body adapter 48 (Figure 4b). The legs 170 have sufficient length to extend distally out<br>
from the flange 88 in an initial state, with the tabs 166 being not deflected (Figure 2). Stops 174,<br>
24<br><br>
corresponding to the legs 170 of the locking ring 54, protrude from the distal end 160 of the shell<br>
156. The stops 174 are positioned to not obscure the stop surface 136, but are positioned to axially<br>
engage the legs 170. With movement of the dose-setting mechanism 12 from the first position to<br>
the second position, the stops 174 engage the legs 170 and cause the locking ring 54 to be held in a<br>
fixed position for the final length of the movement between the first and second positions.<br>
Accordingly, the annular body 168 is forced onto the moving dose-setting mechanism 12, and, more<br>
particularly, onto the tabs 166. With engagement of the tabs 166, the dose-setting mechanism 12<br>
can be actuated.<br>
[0064]	For disengagement of the locking ring 54, one or more extensions 176 extend from<br>
the spring seat 98 which are formed to hold the locking ring 54 in a fixed position upon proximal<br>
movement of the dose-setting mechanism 12 from the second position to the first position. The<br>
extensions 176 hold the locking ring 54 in a fixed position for the final length of the movement,<br>
thus, forcing the locking ring 54 off of the tabs 166 and returning the locking ring 54 to its initial<br>
position. The dose-setting mechanism 12 is then not actuatable.<br>
[0065]	The injector device 10 can be re-set using various techniques, and possibly special<br>
tools. Re-setting may require not only moving the dose-setting mechanism 12 from the second<br>
position, but also re-setting the cartridge engagement surface 57 to its initial position. With<br>
reference to Figures 13a-g, a mandrel 178 is shown that may be inserted into the housing 14 to<br>
cause movement of the dose-setting mechanism 12 from the second position to the first position to<br>
re-set the injection device 10, where preferably the retaining arrangement acts to hold the dose-<br>
setting mechanism 12 in the first position. The mandrel 178 may also force the leadscrew 56 to its<br>
25<br><br>
initial position. The mandrel 178 may be further formed with various features which also permit<br>
rotation of the release ring 50 to an initial position with the engagement surface 122 being axially<br>
aligned with the actuation surface 120.<br>
[0066]	With reference to Figures 13a-g, the mandrel 178 includes a base 180 and an<br>
upstanding shaft portion 182 extending therefrom. The base 180 is sized and shaped to provide the<br>
mandrel 178 with sufficient stability to stand vertically as shown in Figures 13a-e. The shaft<br>
portion 182 is generally cylindrical and formed with an outer diameter smaller than the opening in<br>
the distal end 44 to permit insertion of the shaft portion 182 into the injector device 10. Preferably,<br>
the base 180 is formed larger than the opening in the distal end 44 so as to act as a stop against<br>
excessive insertion.<br>
[0067]	The shaft portion 182 includes at least one protruding locator pin 184, preferably<br>
two diametrically opposed locator pins 184, extending radially from the shaft portion 182. The<br>
locator pins 184 are positioned and formed to slide into the slots 141 formed in the front housing 40.<br>
To ensure proper alignment of the shaft portion 182 within the injector device 10, the locator pins<br>
184 are sized only to permit insertion with the locator pins 184 being in the slots 141 (i.e., insertion<br>
is prevented where the locator pins 184 are not aligned with the slots 141)<br>
[0068]	At the free end of the shaft portion 182, interrupted flange portions 186 extend<br>
radially outwardly having breaks 188 defined therebetween. The flange portions 186 each include a<br>
generally flat top portion 190 on which is formed teeth 192. The teeth 192 are formed to shape<br>
matingly engage ratchet teeth 194 formed on the release ring 50 (Figure 7a) so that when engaged<br>
rotation of the mandrel 178 will result in rotation of the release ring 50. As will be appreciated by<br>
26<br><br>
those skilled in the art, any set of cooperating members can be used which will permit a clutching-<br>
type action and simultaneous rotation.<br>
[0069]	One or more re-set channels 196 are formed on the side of the shaft portion 182,<br>
each extending from one of the breaks 188. Preferably, two of the re-set channels 196 are provided.<br>
The re-set channels 196 are each defined by spaced-apart straight guide wall 198 and configured<br>
guide wall 200. With reference to Figure 13d, the straight guide wall 198 is preferably aligned to<br>
extend from one end of the associated break 188 and is generally parallel to a longitudinal axis of<br>
the shaft portion 182. The configured guide wall 200 includes a first, generally straight portion 202<br>
and a second divergent portion 204. The straight guide wall 198 and the second divergent portion<br>
204 of the configured guide wall 200 define an enlarged pocket 206 of the re-set channel 196. All<br>
of the enlarged pockets 206 formed about the shaft portion 182 are preferably aligned to radially<br>
extend in the same direction. Li other words, with looking at the circumference of the shaft portion<br>
182, all of the enlarged pockets 206 preferably extend away from the associated straight guide wall<br>
198 in the same angular direction (clockwise or counter-clockwise).<br>
[0070]	The re-set channels 196 are formed to accommodate the stops 174 in sliding<br>
engagement. The stops 174 are preferably inwardly directed in extending from the shell 156. The<br>
interengagement of the locator pins 184 and the slots 141 allows for axial alignment of the stops 174<br>
and the re-set channels 196. With insertion of the mandrel 178 into the injector device 10, the stops<br>
174 slide within the re-set channels 196; the straight guide wall 198 and the first straight portion 202<br>
of the configured guide wall 200 prevent relative rotation between the mandrel 178 and the injector<br>
device 10 for a predetermined length of movement. Upon traversing the predetermined length of<br>
-26-<br><br>
movement, the stops 174 reach the enlarged pockets 206, where rotation between the mandrel 178<br>
and the injector device 10 is permitted.<br>
[0071]	It is also preferred that the shaft portion 182 define an inner lumen 208 sized to<br>
accept insertion of the shaft portion 80 of the body adapter 48 (Figures 13f and 13g). The inner<br>
lumen 208 preferably extends the full length of the mandrel 178 and is open at both ends. An<br>
inwardly extending ridge 210 is formed at a mid-point of the inner lumen 208. The ridge 210 is<br>
annular in shape and formed with a smaller diameter than the shaft portion 80 to bear against the<br>
plunger 52 (or the cartridge engagement surface 57 if the plunger 52 is not utilized).<br>
[0072]	The shaft portion 182 is formed with sufficient length to forcibly urge the dose-<br>
setting mechanism 12 from the second position to the first position. In addition, flie ridge 210 is<br>
located to urge the leadscrew 56 to a start position. As such, the injector device 10 is re-settable to<br>
permit a further automatic reconstitution and is re-settable to have the dose-setting mechanism 12<br>
back to its start position.<br>
[0073]	With reference to Figures 14-16, a re-setting process is depicted. With the drug<br>
cartridge assembly 16 not being present in the housing 14, the mandrel 178 is inserted into the<br>
housing 14 with the locator pins 184 sliding along the slots 141. With insertion, the shaft portion 80<br>
of the body adapter 48 is received within the inner lumen 208 with the plunger 52 engaging the<br>
ridge 210. Further insertion causes the dose-setting mechanism 12 to retract proximally against the<br>
force of the biasing means 94. With the dose-setting mechanism 12 still being outside of the first<br>
position, the leadscrew 56 is non-rotatably fixed and, thus, is not movable proximally relative to the<br>
dose-setting mechanism 12. Accordingly, the leadscrew 56 transmits the force applied to the<br>
28<br><br>
plunger 52 to the dose-setting mechanism 12 until the dose-setting mechanism 12 is forced to the<br>
first position, as shown in Figure 15. At this point, the leadscrew 56 is released and allowed to<br>
rotate, as described above, whereby further insertion of the mandrel 178 into the housing 14 causes<br>
the leadscrew 56 to move proximally to its start position, as shown in Figure 16. The spring<br>
74/resilient tube 73 limits the proximal movement of the leadscrew 56 relative to the dose-setting<br>
mechanism 12.<br>
[0074]	With the dose-setting mechanism 12 and the leadscrew 56 having been urged to their<br>
respective start positions, the mandrel 178 is fully inserted into the housing. Here, the teeth 192 of<br>
the flange portions 186 engage the ratchet teeth 194 of the release ring 50. The mandrel 178 is<br>
caused to rotate with the release ring 50 also rotating. As a result, the release slots 116 are taken out<br>
of alignment with the ribs 112, and the dose-setting mechanism 12 is releasably retained, as<br>
described above. The configuration of the enlarged pockets 206 will only permit rotation in one<br>
direction, to ensure that the release ring 50 is properly situated for later actuation. The mandrel 178<br>
is then removed, and the housing 14 is ready to receive a drag cartridge assembly 216.<br>

The present invention is directed to an automatic reconstitution drug delivery device.<br>
The inventive device effects simple and automatic reconstitution of a dry drug. To effect<br>
reconstitution, a user displaces a release button which causes first and second chambers<br>
of a drug cartridge to communicate, resulting in automatic mixing of a diluent and dry<br>
drug to effect reconstitution of the dry drug. The user then simply sets the dose volume<br>
using a dose-setting mechanism, and administers the injection in a manner typical of self-<br>
injection drug delivery devices. Whole or partial automatic priming can be also achieved<br>
by the device.<br></td>
