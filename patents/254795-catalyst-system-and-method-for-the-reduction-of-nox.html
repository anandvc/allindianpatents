CATALYST SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR THE REDUCTION OF NOX<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates generally to a catalyst system and method for the reduction of<br>
nitrogen oxide emissions and more particularly to a catalyst system that comprises a<br>
multi-component catalyst and a reductant.<br>
Methods have long been sought to reduce the deleterious effects of air pollution<br>
caused by byproducts resulting from the imperfect high-temperature combustion of<br>
organic materials. When combustion occurs in the presence of excess air and at high<br>
temperatures, harmful byproducts, such as nitrogen oxides, commonly known as NOX,<br>
are created. NOX and subsequent derivatives have been suggested to play a major<br>
role in the formation of ground-level ozone that is associated with asthma and other<br>
respiratory ailments. NOX also contributes to soot formation, which is linked to a<br>
number of serious health effects, as well as to acid rain and the deterioration of coastal<br>
estuaries. As a result, NOX emissions are subject to many regulatory provisions<br>
limiting the amount of NOX that may be present in effluent gas vented into the<br>
surrounding environment.<br>
One known method for dealing with NOX involves the use of selective catalytic<br>
reduction (SCR) to reduce NOX to nitrogen gas (N2) using ammonia (NH3) as a<br>
reductant. However, as ammonia's own hazardous consequences are well known, the<br>
use of NH3 in an SCR system presents additional environmental and other problems<br>
that must also be addressed. As regulatory agencies continue to drive limits on NOX<br>
emission lower, other regulations are also driving down the permissible levels of NH3<br>
that may be emitted into the atmosphere. Because of regulatory limits on ammonia<br>
slip, the use of hydrocarbons and their oxygen derivatives for NOX reduction in an<br>
SCR process is very attractive. Numerous catalysts have been suggested for this<br>
purpose including zeolites, perovskites, and metals on metal oxide catalyst support.<br>
However, existing catalyst systems have either low activity or narrow region of<br>
working temperatures or low stability to water, which are detrimental to practical use.<br>
U.S. Patent 6,703,343 teaches catalyst systems for use in NOX reduction. However,<br>
1<br><br>
146984<br>
these catalyst systems require a specially synthesized metal oxide catalyst support<br>
with very low level of impurities. Therefore there is a need for an effective catalyst<br>
system to reduce NOX emissions, which system is stable and operable at a wide range<br>
of temperatures.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>

reduction of NOX, which catalyst system comprises a catalyst comprising a metal<br>
oxide catalyst support, a catalytic metal oxide comprising at least one of gallium<br>
oxide or silver oxide, and at least one promoting metal selected from the group<br>

methanol, ethyl alcohol, butyl alcohol, propyl alcohol, dimethyl ether, dimethyl<br>
carbonate and combinations thereof. The organic reductant and the NOX are present in<br>
a carbon:NOx molar ratio from about 0.5:1 to about 24:1.<br>

In yet another embodiment the present invention is a method for reducing NOX, which<br>
comprises the steps of: providing a gas mixture comprising NOX and an organic<br>

about 1 mole % to about 12 mole %; (C) oxygen from about 1 mole % to about 15<br>
mole %; and (D) an organic reductant comprising oxygen selected from the group<br>
consisting of methanol, ethyl alcohol, butyl alcohol, propyl alcohol, dimethyl ether,<br>

to about 100000 hr1.<br>
Various other features, aspects, and advantages of the present invention will become<br>
more apparent with reference to the following description and appended claims.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
In the following specification and the claims, which follow, reference will be made to<br>
a number of terms which shall be defined to have the following meanings.   The<br>
3<br><br>
146984<br>
singular forms "a", "an" and "the" include plural referents unless the context clearly<br>
dictates otherwise.<br>
In one embodiment the present invention comprises a catalyst system for the selective<br>
reduction of NOX, which catalyst system comprises a catalyst and a reductant. The<br>
catalyst comprises a metal oxide catalyst support, a catalytic metal oxide, and a<br>
promoting metal. The reductant comprises an organic compound comprising oxygen.<br>
The metal oxide catalyst support may comprise alumina, titania, zirconia, ceria,<br>
silicon carbide or any mixture of these materials. Typically, the metal oxide catalyst<br>
support comprises gamma-alumina with high surface area comprising impurities of at<br>
least about 0.2% by weight in one embodiment and at least about 0.3% by weight<br>
impurities in another embodiment. The metal oxide catalyst support may be made by<br>
any method known to those of skill in the art, such as co-precipitation, spray drying<br>
and sol-gel methods for example.<br>
The catalyst also comprises a catalytic metal oxide. In one embodiment the catalytic<br>
metal oxide comprises at least one of gallium oxide or silver oxide. In a particular<br>
embodiment the catalyst comprises from about 5 mole % to about 31 mole % of<br>
gallium oxide. In another particular embodiment the catalyst comprises from about 12<br>
mole % to about 31 mole % of gallium oxide. In still another particular embodiment<br>
the catalyst comprises from about 18 mole % to about 3.1 mole % of gallium oxide,<br>
wherein in all cases mole percent is determined by dividing the number of moles of<br>
catalytic metal by the total number of moles of the metal components in the catalyst,<br>
including the catalyst support and any promoting metal present. In another particular<br>
embodiment the catalyst comprises from about 0.5 mole % to about 31 mole % of<br>
silver oxide. In another particular embodiment the catalyst comprises from about 10<br>
mole % to about 25 mole % of silver oxide. In still another particular embodiment the<br>
catalyst comprises from about 12 mole % to about 20 mole % of silver oxide, wherein<br>
in all cases mole percent is determined by dividing the number of moles of catalytic<br>
metal by the total number of moles of the metal components in the catalyst, including<br>
the metal components of the catalyst support and any promoting metal present.<br>
4<br><br>
146984<br>
The catalyst also comprises at least one promoting metal. The promoting metal may<br>
comprise at least one of silver, cobalt, molybdenum, tungsten or indium. Additionally,<br>
the promoting metal may also be a combination of more than one of these metals.<br>
The catalyst typically comprises from about 1 mole % to about 22 mole % of the<br>
promoting metal. In some embodiments the catalyst comprises from about 1 mole %<br>
to about 12 mole % of the promoting metal and in some other embodiments from<br>
about 1 mole % to about 7 mole % of the promoting metal. In one particular<br>
embodiment the catalyst comprises from about 1 mole % to about 5 mole % of the<br>
promoting metal. It should be appreciated that the term "promoting metal" is meant to<br>
encompass elemental metals, metal oxides or salts of the promoting metal, such as<br>
CO2O3 for example. In one particular embodiment wherein the catalytic metal oxide<br>
comprises silver oxide, the catalyst system must further comprise at least one<br>
promoting metal which is selected from the group consisting of cobalt, molybdenum,<br>
tungsten, indium, and mixtures thereof.<br>
The catalysts may be produced by an incipient wetness technique, comprising the<br>
application of homogenous and premixed precursor solutions for catalytic metal oxide<br>
and promoting metal contacted with the metal oxide catalyst support. The metal<br>
oxide particles for the catalyst support are typically calcined before application of<br>
precursor solution. In some embodiments a primary drying step at about 80°C to<br>
about 120°C for about 1 -2 hours is followed by the main calcination process. The<br>
calcination may be carried out at a temperature in the range of from about SOOT to<br>
about 800°C. In some embodiments the calcination is carried out at a temperature in a<br>
range of from about 650°C to about 725°C. In some embodiments the calcination is<br>
done for about 2 hours to about 10 hours. In some other embodiments the calcination<br>
is done for about 4 hours to about 8 hours. The particles are sifted to collect and use<br>
those which are from about 0.1 to about 1000 micrometers in diameter. In one<br>
embodiment the particle size ranges from about 2 micrometers to about 50<br>
micrometers in diameter. Based on the surface area and total pore volume of the metal<br>
oxide catalyst support particles, the desired loading of the catalyst may then be<br>
calculated. As will be appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art, the surface<br>
area and porosity may be up to about 20-30% lower in the final catalyst product, as a<br>
5<br><br>
146984<br>
result of catalyst loading. The loading of the catalyst is determined by the total pore<br>
volume of the support, which is the volume of metal precursors that can be loaded by<br>
incipient wetness. The precursor loading is chosen such that the amount of metal is<br>
typically less than a monolayer of the active metal oxide on the metal oxide catalyst<br>
support. In some embodiments twice the pore volume is used as the total volume of<br>
precursor to load and the metal loading is taken in the range of from about 1 millimole<br>
to about 5 millimoles of the mixture of catalytic metal oxide and promoting metal per<br>
gram of metal oxide catalyst support.<br>
In the subsequent steps of preparing the catalyst, precursor solutions of the catalytic<br>
metal oxide and, one or more promoting metals may be prepared. Precursor solutions<br>
may be prepared in aqueous media, in hydrophilic organic media, or in a mixture<br>
thereof. Hydrophilic organic media comprise carboxylic acids, alcohols and mixtures<br>
thereof such as, but not limited to, acetic acid or ethanol. The solutions are typically<br>
made by mixing solvent with metal salts, such as, but not limited to, metal nitrates,<br>
citrates, oxalates, acetylacetonates, molybdates, or benzoates, in an amount to create a<br>
solution of appropriate molarity based on the desired catalyst composition. In some<br>
embodiments the metal salt is a molybdenum heteropoly anion or ammonium<br>
molybdate. The methods used for preparing the catalyst system are known in the art<br>
and include depositing metal oxide catalyst support in a honey-comb support in a<br>
wash coating method or extruding in a slurry into a desired form. The purity of the<br>
metal precursors for both catalytic metal oxide and promoting metal is in the range of<br>
from about 95 % to about 99.999 % by weight. In one embodiment, all the metal<br>
precursors are mixed together and are as homogeneous as possible prior to addition to<br>
the metal oxide catalyst support. In some other embodiments different metal<br>
precursors are added sequentially to the metal oxide catalyst support. In one<br>
embodiment, the desired volume of the precursor solution is added to coat the metal<br>
oxide catalyst support and create a catalyst with the desired final catalyst loading.<br>
Once the metal salt solution or solutions have been added to the metal oxide catalyst<br>
support, the catalyst may optionally be left to stand for a period of time, in some<br>
embodiments about 6 to 10 hours. The catalyst is then dried for a period of time at a<br>
desired temperature. In a particular embodiment the catalyst may be dried under a<br>
6<br><br>
146984<br>
vacuum, optionally while a nitrogen stream is passed over the mixture. Finally, the<br>
catalyst may be calcined at a desired temperature and for a desired time to create the<br>
final catalyst product.<br>
r<br>
Catalysts according to exemplary embodiments of the present invention may be<br>
created using either a manual or an automated process. Typically, a manual process is<br>
used for the preparation of catalysts of a larger mass, such as about 1 to about 20<br>
grams (g) for example. An automated process is typically used when the catalysts are<br>
of a smaller mass, such as about 5 milligrams (mg) to about 100 mg, for example.<br>
Generally, manual and automated processes for preparation of the catalyst are similar<br>
with the exception that an automated process involves automated measuring and<br>
dispensing of the precursor solutions to the metal oxide catalyst support.<br>
The reductant for use in the catalyst system of exemplary embodiments of the present<br>
invention comprises an organic compound comprising oxygen. Said organic<br>
compounds comprising oxygen are fluid, either as a liquid or gas, such that they may<br>
flow through the catalyst when introduced into an effluent gas stream for use in a<br>
catalyst system for the reduction of NOX. Typically, hydrocarbons comprising oxygen<br>
of less than about 16 carbon atoms will be fluid, although hydrocarbons comprising<br>
oxygen with higher numbers of carbon atoms may also be fluid, for example,<br>
depending on the chemical structure and temperature of the gas stream. The organic<br>
compounds comprising oxygen suitable for use as reductants typically comprise a<br>
member selected from the group consisting of an alcohol, an ether, an ester, a<br>
carboxylic acid, an aldehyde, a ketone, a carbonate and combinations thereof. In<br>
some embodiments the organic compounds comprising oxygen suitable for use as<br>
reductants comprise at least one functional group selected from the group consisting<br>
of hydroxy, alkoxy, carbonyl, carbonate and combinations thereof. Some non-limiting<br>
examples of organic compounds comprising oxygen suitable for use as reductants<br>
comprise methanol, ethyl alcohol, 1-butanol, 2-butanol, 1-propanol, iso-propanol,<br>
dimethyl ether, dimethyl carbonate and combinations thereof.<br>
The catalyst system may be used in conjunction with any process or system in which<br>
it may be desirable to reduce NOX emissions, such as a gas turbine; a steam turbine; a<br>
7<br><br>
146984<br>
boiler; a locomotive; or a transportation exhaust system, such as, but not limited to, a<br>
diesel exhaust system. The catalyst system may also be used in conjunction with<br>
systems involving generating gases from burning coal, burning volatile organic<br>
compounds (VOC), or in the burning of plastics; or in silica plants, or in nitric acid<br>
plants. The catalyst is typically placed at a location within an exhaust system where it<br>
will be exposed to effluent gas comprising NOX. The catalyst may be arranged as a<br>
packed or fluidized bed reactor, coated on a monolithic, foam, mesh or membrane<br>
structure, or arranged in any other manner within the exhaust system such that the<br>
catalyst is in contact with the effluent gas.<br>
As will be appreciated by those ordinarily skilled in the art, although catalytic<br>
reactions are generally complex and involve many steps, the overall basic selective<br>
catalytic reduction reaction process for the reduction of NOX is believed to occur as<br>
follows:<br>
NOX + O2 + organic reductant -&gt; N2 + CO2 + H2O   (1)<br>
The effluent gas stream usually comprises air, water, CO, CO2, NOX, and may also<br>
comprise other impurities. Additionally, uncombusted or incompletely combusted fuel<br>
may also be present in the effluent gas stream. The organic reductant is typically fed<br>
into the effluent gas stream to form a gas mixture, which is then fed through the<br>
catalyst. Sufficient oxygen to support the NOX reduction reaction may already be<br>
present in the effluent gas stream. If the oxygen present in the gas mixture is not<br>
sufficient for the NOX reduction reaction, additional oxygen gas may also be<br>
introduced into the effluent gas stream in the form of oxygen or air. In some<br>
embodiments the gas stream comprises from about 1 mole % to about 21 mole % of<br>
oxygen gas. In some other embodiments the gas stream comprises from about 1 mole<br>
% to about 15 mole % of oxygen gas.<br>
One advantage of embodiments of the present invention is that the reduction reaction<br>
may take place in "reductant lean" conditions. That is, the amount of reductant added<br>
to the effluent gas to reduce the NOX is generally low. Reducing the amount of<br>
reductant to convert the NOX to nitrogen may provide for a more efficient process that<br>
8<br><br>
146984<br>
has decreased raw material costs. The molar ratio of reductant to NOX is typically in a<br>
range of from about 0.25:1 to about 6:1. In other embodiments the ratio is typically<br>
such that the ratio of carbon atoms in the reductant is about 0.5 to about 24 moles per<br>
mole of NOX. In some other embodiments the organic reductant and the NOX are<br>
present in a carbon:NOx molar ratio in a range of from about 0.5:1 to about 15:1. In a<br>
particular embodiment the organic reductant and the NOX are present in a carbon:NOx<br>
molar ratio in a range of from about 0.5:1 to about 8:1.<br>
The reduction reaction may take place over a range of temperatures. Typically, the<br>
temperature may range in one embodiment from about 100°C to about 600°C, in<br>
another embodiment from about 200°C to about 500°C and in still another<br>
embodiment from about 350°C to about 450°C.<br>
The reduction reaction may take place under conditions wherein the gas mixture is<br>
configured to have a space velocity in one embodiment in a range of from about 5000<br>
reciprocal hours (hr-1) to about 100000 hr-1, in another embodiment in a range of from<br>
about 8000 hr-1 to about 50000 hr-1 and in still another embodiment in a range of from<br>
about 8000 hr-1 to about 40000 hr-1.<br>
Exemplary embodiments of the catalyst system may also advantageously be used in<br>
wet conditions. In particular embodiments NOX reduction accomplished using<br>
exemplary embodiments of the present invention may be effective in effluent gas<br>
streams comprising water. In some embodiments the gas stream comprises from about<br>
1 mole % to about 12 mole % of water and in some other embodiments from about 2<br>
mole % to about 10 mole % of water.<br>
Without further elaboration, it is believed that one skilled in the art can, using the<br>
description herein, utilize the present invention to its fullest extent. The following<br>
examples are included to provide additional guidance to those skilled in the art in<br>
practicing the claimed invention. The examples provided are merely representative of<br>
the work that contributes to the teaching of the present application. Accordingly,<br>
these examples are not intended to limit the invention, as defined in the appended<br>
claims, in any manner.<br>

146984<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
Catalysts were prepared and used in combination with reductants in accordance with<br>
exemplary embodiments of the present invention. The conversion of the NOX was<br>
analyzed over a variety of experimental conditions, including varying catalyst<br>
compositions, reductants, reaction temperatures, and reductant to NOx ratios.<br>
In the following examples catalyst samples were prepared each having a gamma-<br>
alumina catalyst support commercially available from Saint-Gobain NorPro of Stow,<br>
Ohio. The alumina catalyst support had a purity of 99.5% to 99.7%. The alumina<br>
support was first calcined at 725°C for 6 hours in presence of an oxidant. The oxidant<br>
may be air or an oxidant gas comprising about 1 % to about 21% of oxygen in<br>
nitrogen. The alumina particles were then sifted to collect catalyst support having a<br>
particle size diameter of from about 450 micrometers to about 1000 micrometers.<br>
Prior to loading, the catalyst support had a surface area of about 240 square meters per<br>
gram (m2/g) and a pore volume of 0.796 milliliters per gram (mL/g).<br>
Gallium was used as the metal for the catalytic metal oxide added to the alumina. The<br>
gallium was added in a soluble form to wet the alumina support and was made from a<br>
solution of gallium nitrate having the formula Ga(NO3)3 • 6H2O. The solution was<br>
made by combining deionized water with gallium nitrate having a purity of 99.999%<br>
(metals basis) obtained from Alfa-Aesar of Ward Hill, Massachusetts. Millipore<br>
water having a resistivity of 18 megaohm-centimeters was employed in all operations.<br>
For the promoting metal an aqueous solution of the nitrate salt of the desired metal(s)<br>
also having a purity of 99.999% (metals basis) and obtained from Alfa-Aesar was<br>
added to the alumina support. All the metal precursors were mixed together and were<br>
as homogeneous as possible prior to addition to the alumina support. The catalysts<br>
were left to stand for 6 to 10 hours and were then dried under a dynamic vacuum with<br>
a nitrogen influx for 4 to 5 hours at 80°C. Finally, the dried catalyst was heat treated.<br>
The heat profile for this treatment began with an increase from 25°C to 110°C at<br>
1.4°C per minute. The catalyst was held at 110°C for 1.5 hours, after which the<br>
temperature was ramped at 5°C per minute to a value of 650°C. The catalyst was held<br>
10<br><br>
146984<br>
6 hours at this temperature and then allowed to cool over a period of about 4 to 6<br>
hours.<br>
Catalysts were tested in a 32-tube high-throughput heterogeneous catalyst-screening<br>
micro-reactor. The reactor was a heated, common headspace gas distribution<br>
manifold that distributed a reactant stream equally via matched capillaries to parallel<br>
reactor tubes. The manifold had heated capabilities, allowing pre-heating of the<br>
reactant stream and vaporization of liquid reactants prior to distribution. The entire<br>
heated manifold assembly was mounted on a vertical translation stage, raised and<br>
lowered via pneumatic pressure. Reactor tubes were inserted in a gold-coated 10<br>
centimeter (cm) thick insulated copper reactor block (dimension 13.5 cm x 25 cm),,<br>
which was electrically heated to vary temperature between 200°C to 650°C.<br>
Chemically inert KALREZ™ o-rings available from DuPont of Wilmington,<br>
Delaware, served as viscoelastic end-seals on either end of each reactor tube. Reactor<br>
tubes were made of INCONEL 600 ™ tubing with 0.635 cm outside diameter and<br>
0.457 cm internal diameter, available from Inco Alloys/Special Metals of Saddle<br>
Brook, New Jersey. The tubes were free to slide vertically through the gold-coated<br>
copper heating block. Each tube contained a quartz wool frit, on which the catalyst<br>
samples of about 0.050 g were placed in the center of each of the tubes through which<br>
a reactant stream of a blended gas mixture comprising NOX and reductant simulating<br>
an effluent gas stream was passed. A single bypass tube was used to ensure equal<br>
flow through each of the 32 testing tubes. The fittings were connected to a<br>
distribution manifold for delivery of the blended gas mixture. The components of the<br>
blended gas mixture were fed to a common mixing manifold using electronic mass<br>
flow controllers, and then routed to the distribution manifold. The pressure in the<br>
distribution manifold was maintained at about 275.8 kilopascals (kPa). Reactor<br>
temperature and flow control were fully automated.<br>
Once loaded in the tubes, the catalysts were heat-treated under airflow as described<br>
herein above and then reacted with the blended gas mixture. The reactor effluent was<br>
sent to heated sampling valves that selected tubes in series and fed the continuous<br>
11<br><br>
146984<br>
stream to a chemiluminescent analyzer. Any stream that was not routed to the<br>
analytical device was routed to a common vent.<br>
Switching valves for routing gases were computer controlled and actuated in a pre-<br>
determined time-based sequence. The chemiluminescent analyzer was connected to a<br>
computer-based data-logging system. Data corresponding to reactor tube effluent<br>
composition were time-stamped and stored. Data from the bypass tube were also<br>
stored as a reference to the inlet composition of the catalyst reactor tubes. This<br>
permitted the combination of data to determine activity and selectivity of each catalyst<br>
sample.<br>
For NOX reduction testing the reactant stream of the blended gas mixture comprised<br>
reductant, about 200 ppm NOX, 12% by volume oxygen, 7% by volume water and the<br>
balance nitrogen. The type and amount of reductant in the stream varied depending<br>
on the experiments being conducted. The flow rate of the blended gas mixture<br>
through each of the tubes was 33 standard cubic centimeters per minute (sccm) per<br>
tube.<br>
Table 1 shows the compositions of the catalyst samples prepared, with compositions<br>
expressed in mole percent of each promoting metal and/or catalytic metal present in<br>
the catalyst. The balance of the composition was alumina from the alumina catalyst<br>
support. Mole percent was determined for each component by dividing the number of<br>
moles of that component by the total number of moles of the metal components in the<br>
catalyst, including the metal components of the metal oxide catalyst support. The<br>
abbreviation "C.Ex." means Comparative Example. Comparative example 1 consists<br>
only of the alumina support.<br>
