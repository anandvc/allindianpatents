USEFUL AS ANTITUMOUR AGENTS Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to novel pyrrolo[2,l-c][l,4]benzodiazepine-anthraquinone hybrids useful as potential antitumour agents. The present invention also relates to the synthesis of pyrrolo[2,l-c][l,4]benzodiazepine-anthraquinone hybrids as useful anticancer agents. The structural formula of novel pyrrolo[2,l-c][l,4]benzodiazepine-anthraquinone hybrids (V) is as follows, wherein n = 3,4; R = H, OH.<br>
(FORMULA REMOVED)<br>
Background of the invention<br>
Pyrrolo[2,l-c][l,4]benzodiazepines are a family of DNA interactive antitumour antibiotics derived from streptomyces species. Examples of naturally occurring pyrrolo[2,l-c][l,4] benzodiazepines include anthramycin, tomaymycin, sibiromycin and DC-81. These compounds show their biological activity through covalent binding via their NlO-Cll imine/carbinol amine moiety to the C2-amine position of a guanine residue within the minor groove of DNA giving rise to the preference for pu-G-pu sequences. (Kunimoto, S.; Masuda, T.; Kanbayashi, N.; Hamada, M.; Naganawa, H.; Miyamoto, M.; Takeuchi, T and Unezawa, H. J. Antibiot., 1980, 33, 665.; Kohn, K. W. and Speous, C. L. J. Mol. Biol., 1970, 91, 551.; Hurley, L. H.; Gairpla, C. and Zmijewski, M. Biochem. Biophy. Acta., 1977, 475, 521.; Kaplan, D. J. and Hurley, L. H. Biochemistry, 1981, 20, 7572.) The molecules have a right-handed twist, when viewed from the C-ring towards the A-ring. This enables the PBD to mirror the curvature of B-form DNA and maintain isohelical contact with the walls and floor of the minor groove. In the last few years a growing interest has been shown in the development of new pyrrolo[2,l-c][l,4]benzodiazepine.hybrids. Many PBD conjugates have been synthesized and investigated for their anticancer activity. (Thurston, D. E.; Morris, S. J.; Hartley, J. A. Chem. Commun. 1996, 563.; Damayanthi, Y.; Reddy, B. S. P.; Lown, J. W. J. Org. Chem. 1999, 64, 290.; Kamal, A.; Reddy, B. S. N.; Reddy, G. S. K.; Ramesh, G Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2002, 12, 1933). Recently C-8 linked PBD dimers with C2/C2 exounsaturation have been designed and synthesized (Gregson, S. J.; Howard, P. W.; Hartley,<br>
J. A.; Brooks, N. A.; Adam, L. J.; Jenkins, T. C; Kelland, L. R. and Thurston, D. E., J. Med.<br>
Chem. 2001, 44, 737). Recently, a non cross-linking mixed imine-amide PBD dimers have been synthesized that have significant DNA binding ability and potent antitumor activity (Kamal, A.; Ramesh, G.; Laxman, N.; Ramulu, P.; Srinivas, O.; NeeHma, K.; Kondapi, A. K.; Srinu, V. B.; Nagarajaram, H. M. J. Med. Chem. 2002, 45, 4679).<br>

Biological activity: In vitro cytotoxicity against human cancer cell lines:<br>
Human cancer cell lines procured fi^om National Cancer Institute, Frederick, U.S.A or National Center for Cell Science; Pune, India, were used in present study. Cells were grown in tissue culture flasks in complete growth medium (RPMI-1640 medium with 2 mM glutamine, 100 ng/ml streptomycin, pH 7.4, sterilized by filtration and supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 100 units/ml penicillin before use) at 37°C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 90% relative humidity in a carbon dioxide incubator. Cells at subconfluent stage were harvested from the flask by treatment with trypsin (0.5%) in PBS containing 0.02% EDTA) for determination of cytotoxicity. Cells with viability of more than 98% as determined by trypan blue exclusion were used for assay. Cell suspensions of required cell density were prepared in complete growth medium with gentamycin (50|ag/ml) for determination of cytotoxicity. Stock solutions of (2 X 10"^ M) of test material were prepared in DMSO (Dimethyl sulphoxide). The stock solutions were serially diluted with complete growth medium containing 50ng/ml of gentamycin to obtain working test solutions of<br>
required concentrations. In vitro cytotoxicity against human cancer cell lines was determined (Monks,A., Scudiero,D., Skehan,P., Shoemaker R., Paull, K., Vistica,D., Hose, C.,Langley, j., Cronise, P., Vaigro-WolfF, A., Gray-Goodrich, M., Campbell,H., Mayo, J and Boyd mJ. Natl. Cancer /m/., 1991,83, 757-766) using 96-well tissue culture plates. The 100 µl of cell suspension was added to each well of the 96-well tissue culture plate. The cells were incubated for 24 hours. Test materials in complete growth medium (100|al) were added after 24 hours incubation to the wells containing cell suspension. The plates were further incubated for 48 hours (at 37°C in an atmosphere of 5% and 90% relative humidity in a carbon dioxide incubator) after addition of test material and then the cell growth was stopped by gently layering trichloroacetic acid (TCA, 50µ1, 50%) on top of the medium in all the wells. The plates were incubated at 4°C for one hour to fix the cells attached to the bottom of the wells. The Uquid of all the wells was gently pipetted out and discarded. The plates were washed five times with distilled water to remove TCA, growth medium low molecular weight metabolites, serum proteins etc and air-dried. Cell growth was measured by staining with sulforhodamine B dye (Skehan et al, 1990). The adsorbed dye was dissolved in Tris-Buffer (100 m 1, O.OIM, pH 10.4) and plates were gently stirred for 5 minutes on a mechanical stirrer. The optical density was recorded on ELISA reader at 540 nm. The cell growth was calculated by subtracting mean OD value of respective blank from the mean OD value of experimental set. Percent growth in presence of test material was calculated considering the growth in absence of any test material as 100%and in turn percent growth inhibition in presence of test material will be calculated.<br>
Cytotoxicity: Compounds Va and Vc were evaluated for the primary anticancer activity Table 1. The percentage growth inhibition data for compound Va<br>
