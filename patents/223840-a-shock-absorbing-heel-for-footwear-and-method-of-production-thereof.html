				<td>A Shock-Absorbing Heel For Footwear And Method Of Production<br>
Thereof<br>
METHOD FOR THE PRODUCTION OF A SHOCK ABSORBING HEEL FOR<br>
FOOTWEAR AND THE HEEL PRODUCED THEREBY<br>
DESCRIPTION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates generally to the field<br>
of footwear and, more particularly, relates to a shock-<br>
absorbing heel for footwear and a method for producing it.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Several expedients are known for absorbing and<br>
dampening the stresses that are transmitted to the<br>
skeleton and muscle structure by means of the foot in the<br>
course of normal walking, and even more so on doing<br>
sporting activities (running, jumping, etc.). In<br>
particular, there are known solutions that envisage<br>
forming chambers in the sole of the footwear and arranging<br>
appropriate elastic means or air cushions inside them. In<br>
other solutions the absorption of shocks and stresses is<br>
entrusted to fluid cushions within the sole, thus<br>
realizing even a circulation of air in the sole that will<br>
be produced by the shocks and the walking movement of the<br>
foot itself, especially between the fore part of the sole<br>
and its rear part, and possibly also between the<br>
outside, passing through vents and non-return valves<br>
Expedients of this kind have so far been applied to<br>
footwear of the sporting type or, in any case, equipped<br>
with rubber soles, or soles made of plastic material,<br>
obtained, for example, by means of injection moulding.<br>
Apart from the sure benefit one obtains when<br>
such solutions are adopted in sporting footwear, there can<br>
be no doubt that they can make a significant contribution<br>
to the comfort of any kind of footwear used for everyday<br>
activities. However, there are both aesthetic and<br>
constructional reasons why shoes with soles made of<br>
leather, or similar material, which constitute a<br>
substantial fraction of the commonly employed footwear,<br>
cannot be provided with such expedients capable of damping<br>
the stresses.<br>
Object and Summary of the invention<br>
The object of the present invention is to provide a<br>
footwear heel suitable for soles made of leather or<br>
similar material and having dampening properties capable<br>
of limiting transmission to the skeleton and muscle<br>
structure of the stresses that are generated during<br>
walking. Another object of the present invention is to<br>
provide a method of producing shock-absorbing heels of the<br>
aforementioned type suitable for application in industry<br>
and in mass production.<br>
These aims are attained by means of the shock-<br>
absorbing heel for footwear according to the present<br>
invention and the relevant method for its production<br>
having the characteristics set out in claims 1 and 8<br>
attached hereto.<br>
Brief description of the accompanying drawings<br>
Further characteristics and advantages of the shock-<br>
absorbing heel and the method for its production will be<br>
apparent from the following description of an embodiment<br>
thereof, which is given purely by way of example and is<br>
not to be considered limitative in any way, the<br>
description making reference to the attached drawings, of<br>
which:<br>
- Figure 1 shows a bottom plan view of a heel for<br>
footwear in accordance with the present invention;<br>
- Figure 2 shows a sectional view taken along line<br>
II-II of Figure 1;<br>
- Figure 3 shows a partial sectional view taken<br>
along lines III-III of Figure 1; and<br>
-Figure 4 shows an exploded view of the heel in<br>
accordance with the invention.<br>
Detailed description of the Invention<br>
Referring to the aforesaid figures, the shock-<br>
absorbing heel in accordance with the invention comprises<br>
an underheel 1 made of rubber or some elastomeric material<br>
capable of resisting wear, with a circular window 7<br>
provied at its centre, from which there projects for a few<br>
millimetres an appendix 2 of a core 3 made of resilient<br>
plastic material, polyurethane for example. Core 3 is<br>
enclosed between two thick strips of leather, one of<br>
which, indicated by the reference number 4, is arcuate in<br>
shape such as to line both the rear and the sides of the<br>
heel, while the other, indicated by 5, lines the front<br>
side of the heel.<br>
Advantageously, the projecting appendix 2 of core 3<br>
will be shaped so as to perform its shock-absorbing<br>
function in an optimal manner. In particular, it is formed<br>
with a central depression 8 delimited by a first circular<br>
groove 9 that, in its turn, is delimited by a circular fin<br>
10, constituting the outer edge of the appendix 2 and<br>
placed at some distance from the wall delimiting window<br>
7 of the rubber underheel 1.<br>
Advantageously, an insert 11 of light plastic<br>
material, polystyrene for example, may be provided in core<br>
3 to permit the application of the sole (a visible part of<br>
which has. been indicated by the reference number 6) by<br>
means of nailing. Otherwise, the sole may in any case be<br>
applied by means of gluing.<br>
With a view to facilitating the movement of appendix<br>
2 in the direction orthogonal to the walking plane,<br>
between sole 6 and core 3 there may be provided a chamber<br>
12 forming an air cushion that, by means of its<br>
compression and dilation, will likewise assist in<br>
absorbing the stresses acting on the foot. In that case<br>
insert 11 will have to be provided with a central opening<br>
to establish continuity between appendix 2 of core 3 and<br>
the air contained in chamber 12.<br>
With a view to producing the shock-absorbing heel in<br>
accordance" with the present invention, one first prepares<br>
by means of moulding, or some other suitable process, a<br>
rubber underheel 1 provided with at least one opening, a<br>
central window 7 for example, as shown in the figures. The<br>
underheel 1 is then arranged within a mould for injection<br>
moulding having a shape equal to that of the underheel and<br>
a height substantially equal to the height, of the heel<br>
that is to be produced. The mould is shaped in such a way<br>
as to have a lowered bottom in the position of the opening<br>
provided in the underheel to permit the formation of the<br>
projecting appendix 7. In the space delimited by the two<br>
leather strips 4 and 5 above the underheel 1 there may<br>
also be arranged a connection insert 11 and then, after<br>
closing the mould, thermoplastic or elastomer resin,<br>
polyurethane for example, is injected to form an internal<br>
resilient core provided with an appendix 2 arranged in the<br>
opening 7 and partially projecting therefrom. On<br>
solidifying, the resin becomes secured to the underheel<br>
and the two strips, thus forming a single body.<br>
It is preferable to shape the lid of the mould in<br>
such a manner as to create a chamber 12 in the upper part<br>
of the heel in a position opposite the opening 7, which,<br>
once the sole 6 has been applied, will come to contain an<br>
air cushion that improves the shock-absorbing function of<br>
resilient core 3, facilitating movements of appendix 2 in<br>
the direction at right angles to the plane of walking.<br>
The heel formed in this manner can be fixed to the<br>
sole by means of known systems, for example, by means of<br>
nailing if the insert 11 is present or by means of gluing.<br>
The exterior appearance of the heel produced in this<br>
manner will be the classical one of a leather heel, but<br>
provided with the shock-absorbing function. It is to be<br>
understood that, even though the present description has<br>
been made with reference to the case of heels made of<br>
rubber and the use of strips 4 and 5 consisting of this<br>
material, the invention is applicable in exactly the same<br>
manner also to heels realized with some material that is<br>
visually similar to leather, for example, heels made of<br>
masonite or regenerated leather. In that case, obviously,<br>
the employed strips 4 and 5 will be made of these<br>
materials.<br>
Though the present description makes reference to a<br>
single window provided in the underheel, it is obvious<br>
that the underheel may be provided with several windows,<br>
preferably arranged symmetrically, from each of which<br>
there will project an appendix 2 of the internal elastic<br>
core. Similarly, the shape of the openings provided in the<br>
underheel may be different from the circular shape here<br>
illustrated. The various parts making up the heel in<br>
accordance with the invention are kept together by the<br>
adhesive action developed by the resin at the moment of<br>
injection and its subsequent solidification.<br>
Variations and/or modifications may be brought to the<br>
shock-absorbing heel and the relevant production method<br>
according to the present invention without departing from<br>
the scope of the invention as set forth in the appended<br>
