Description<br>
The present invention relates to crystalline complexes of at least one agriculturally active organic compound A having at least one functional moiety which is capable of serving as a hydrogen acceptor in a hydrogen bond.<br>
Agriculturally active organic compounds such as fungicides, herbicides and insecticides or acaricides are usually marketed as liquid or solid formulations which comprise one or more agriculturally active organic compounds and suitable formulation additives. For several reasons, formulation types are preferred, wherein the agriculturally active organic compound (A) is present in the solid state, examples including solid formulations such as dusts, powders or granules and liquid formulations such as suspension concentrates, i.e. liquid formulations containing solid particles of the active organic compound suspended in a liquid suspension medium.<br>
For formulation purposes the agriculturally active organic compound should be a crystalline material having a sufficiently high melting point. Unfortunately, a large number of such organic compounds are amorphous material and/or have low melting points. Such compounds are difficult to formulate as suspension concentrates (SC) in a conventional manner, since the grinding apparatus will get stuck during grinding as a result of the tackiness of the active compound. Formulations of amorphous solid organic compounds are often instable with regard to phase-separation. For example, suspension concentrates of amorphous solid actives tend to become inhomogeneous by segregation of the active organic compound as a result of particle aggregation or particle growth.<br>
Crystalline complexes of organic compounds, also termed as co-crystals are multi-component crystals or crystalline material that consist of at least two different organic compounds which are usually solid at 25CC or at least a non-volatile oil (vapour pressure less than 1 mbar at 25°C). In the crystalline complexes (or co-crystals) at least two different organic compounds form a crystalline material having a defined crystal structure, i. e. the at least two organic compounds have a defined relative spatial arrangement within the crystal structure, thereby forming a supra-molecular structure.<br>
In the co-crystals the at least two different compounds interact by non-covalent bonding such as hydrogen bonds and, possibly, other non-covalent intermolecular forces, including  -stacking and van der Waals interaction. Hydrogen bonding is a directional and relatively strong interaction and due to these two properties it is often the dominant force in also molecular recognition through out the nature, for example in formation of DNA, folding of proteins in general, receptors etc.. Thus, hydrogen bonding is the force<br><br>
considered in approaches where novel multi-component materials or co-crystals are being designed and described in the literature (see for example D. Braga et al., Chem. Commun., 2005, pp. 2635-3645 and O. Almarsson et al., Chem. Commun., 2004, pp. 1889-1896. However, other intermolecular forces may also be responsible for molecu-lar recognition.<br>
Although the packing in the crystalline lattice cannot be designed or predicted, several supramolecular synthons could successfully recognized in co-crystals. The term "su-pramolecular synthon" has to be understood as an entity of usually two compounds that are hydrogen bonded together. In co-crystals these synthons further pack in the crystalline lattice to form a molecular crystal. Molecular recognition is one condition of the formation of the synthon. However, the co-crystal must also be energeticall favour-able, i.e. an energy win in the formation of the co-crystal is also required, as molecules typically can pack very efficiently as crystals of pure components thereby hindering the co-crystal formation.<br>
In co-crystals, usually one of the organic compounds serves as a co-crystal former, i. e. a compound which itself easily forms a crystalline material and which is capable of forming co-crystals with several other organic compounds which themselves may not necessarily form a crystalline phase.<br>
Crystalline complexes of active pharmaceutical compounds have been described in the art on various occasions, e. g. in US2003/224006, WO03/074474, WO2005/089511, EP1608339, EP1631260 and WO2006/007448.<br>
Thiophanate methyl is a well known crystalline fungicide compound of the formula<br><br>
which melts above 172°C under decomposition. Thiophanate methyl has protective and curative action against a wide range of fungal pathogens. The thiophanate molecule is degraded in the plant to carbendazim and therefore it belongs to the group of benzimi-dazole fungicides.<br>
The inventors of the present invention surprisingly found out that thiophanate-methyl is a suitable co-crystal former which forms crystalline complexes with a large number of agriculturally active organic compounds having at least one functional moiety which is capable of serving as a hydrogen acceptor in a hydrogen bond.<br><br>
Therefore, the present invention relates to crystalline complexes comprising at least one agriculturally active organic compound A having at least one functional moiety which is capable as serving as a hydrogen acceptor in a hydrogen bond and thiophan-ate-methyl.<br>
The crystalline complexes according to the present invention have a defined crystal structure and have a reasonable high melting point which facilitates the incorporation of such complexes into solid or liquid formulations wherein the active material is present in the solid state. Moreover, the formulations of such crystalline complexes show increased stability, in particular in comparison with formulations containing a mixture of thiophanate methyl and compound A as individual solid compounds.<br>
It is presumed that the formation of the crystalline complexes according to the present invention results from the incapability of thiophanate methyl to achieve effective hydrogen bonds for all hydrogen donors and effective packing of the molecules in the crystalline state at the same time. Therefore at least one of the N-bound hydrogen atoms of the thiourea unit in the thiophanate molecule forms a hydrogen bond with the at least one hydrogen acceptor moiety in the agriculturally active compound A and/or the thiophanate molecules form a grid-like structure with cavities, wherein the active compound A molecules are included.<br>
Functional groups or moieties, which are capable of being a hydrogen acceptor in a hydrogen bond include oxygen atoms, such as oxygen atoms in an ether moiety, in particular an oxirane group, in a hydroxyl group, in a carbonyl group, in a carboxyl group, in a carboxyamido group, and nitrogen atoms, in particular in the form of primary, secondary or tertiary amino groups or as imino-nitrogen atoms, i.e. =N-.<br>
Preferably, the compound A comprises at least one, e.g. 1, 2, 3 or 4 imino-nitrogen atoms as functional groups or moieties, which are capable of being a hydrogen acceptor in a hydrogen bond. The imino-nitrogen atom may be part of a cyclic or acyclic moiety such as a heterocyclic ring, an oximino moiety or an amidino moiety. Of course, the compound A may carry one or further atoms or moieties, which are capable of acting as a hydrogen acceptor in a hydrogen bond.<br>
In particular, the compound A comprises at least one functional moiety being capable of being a hydrogen acceptor in a hydrogen bond which contains at least one imino-nitrogen which is a ring member in an 5- or 6-membered aromatic or partially unsaturated heterocyclic ring, such as pyridine, pyrimidine, imidazole or imidazoline such as 1 H-imidazole, 2H-imidazole, 4,5-dihydro-1 H-imidazole, 2,5-dihydro-1 H-imidazole, pyrazole or pyrazoline such as 1H-pyrazole, 4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrazole and triazole rings such as 1H-1,2,4-triazole, 1H-1,3,4-triazole and 1H-1,2,3-triazol rings, in particular<br><br>
pyrazole or triazole ring. The heterocyclic ring may be unsubstituted or substituted, e.g. by 1, 2 or 3 substituent radicals. Suitable substituent radicals are in particular those which do not exert an electron withdrawing mesomeric (-M) effect such as nitro, car-boxylate, sulfonyl or cyano. Suitable substituent radicals include halogen, C1-C6-alkoxy, C1-C4-haloalkyl, C1-C4-haioalkoxy or phenyl, which itself may be substituted or substi-tuted by 1, 2, 3 or 4 radicals selected from C1-C6-alkyl, halogen, C1-C6-alkoxy, C1-C4-haloalkyl and C1-C4-haloalkoxy, and C1-C6-alkyl, which may be unsubstituted or substi-tuted by one radical selected from alkoxy, cyano, phenyl, C1-C4-alkylcarbonyl, C1-C4-alkoxycarbonyl, carboxyl, carboxamido, C1-C4-alkylaminocarbonyl, C1-C4-dialkylamino-carbonyl and C1-C4-alkylcarbonylamino. It has to be understood that the substituted or unsubstituted 5- or 6-membered aromatic or partially unsaturated heterocyclic ring itself may be part of a larger molecule.<br>
Likewise preferably, the imino-nitrogen may be part of an acyclic oximino moiety such as an imino-ether group =N-0-R or an amidino group C(N=R)NR'2, wherein R and R' independently of each other are selected from hydrogen, C1-C6-alkyl, C2-C6-alkenyl or C2-C6-alkinyl.<br>
Preferably the compound A comprises a functional moiety which is selected from a 5-or 6-membered aromatic heterocyclic radical, such as pyridinyl, pyrimidinyl, 1H-imidazolyl, 1H-pyrazole, 4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrazolyl, and triazolyl, such as IH-1,2,4-triazolyl, 4H-1,2,4-triazolyl (= 1H-1,3,4-triazolyl), 1H-1,2,3-triazolyl and 2H-1.2.3-triazolyl rings, preferably a pyrazolyl or triazolyl radical, in particular a 1 H-pyrazolyl or a 1H-1,3,4-triazolyl radical, which may be substituted or substituted as defined above. Preferred substituent radicals include halogen, C1-C6-alkyI, C1-C6-alkoxy, C1-C4-haloalkyl, C1-C4-haloalkoxy or phenyl, which itself may be substituted or substituted by 1, 2, 3 or 4 radicals selected from C1-C6-alkyl, halogen, C1-C6-alkoxy, C1-C4-haloalkyl and C1-C4-haloalkoxy, in particular from halogen or methyl. In particular the compound A comprises one functional moiety, which is selected from imidazol-2-yl, pyrazol-1-yl, pyrazol-3-yl, 1,2,4-triazole-3-yi or 1,2,4-triazole-1-yl, wherein Het is unsubstistuted or may carry 1 or 2 radicals selected from halogen atoms and C1-C4-alkyl and/or 1 phenyl group, which may carry 1, 2 or 3 halogen atoms.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention the compound A carries an optionally sub-stituted phenyl ring, in addition to the functional moiety, which is capable of being a hydrogen acceptor in a hydrogen bond. Without being bound to a theory the inventors believe that in the crystalline complexes of the present invention the phenyl ring has a pi-interaction with the thiophanate molecule. Preferably the phenyl ring is unsubstituted or carries 1, 2 or 3 radicals selected from halogen, C1-C6-alkoxy, C1-C4-haloalkyl, C1-C4-haloalkoxy, phenyl, which itself may be substituted or substituted by 1, 2, 3 or 4 radicals selected from C1-C6-alkyl, halogen, C1-C6-alkoxy, C1-C4-haloalkyl and C1-C4-haloalkoxy, and C1-C6-alkyl, which may be unsubstituted or substituted by one radical<br><br>
selected from alkoxy, cyano, phenyl, C1-C4-alkylcarbonyl, C1-C4-alkoxycarbonyl, car-boxyl, carboxamido, C1-C4-alkylaminocarbonyl, C1-C4-dialkylaminocarbonyl and C1-C4-alkylcarbonylamino. Suitable radicals on the phenyl ring also include the following groups: N(OCH3)(C(O)OCH3), C(=CH-OCH3)(C(O)OCH3), C(=CH-OCH3)(C(O)NHCH3), C(=N-OCH3)(C(O)OCH3) and C(=N-OCH3)(C(O)OCH3). Preference is given to unsub-stituted phenyl or phenyl, which carries 1, 2 or 3 radicals selected from C1-C6-alkyl, halogen, C1-C6-alkoxy, C1-C4-haloalkyl and C1-C4-haloalkoxy, in particular from halogen and methyl, and phenyl which carries one of the following radicals: N(OCH3)(C(O)OCH3), C(=CH-OCH3)(C(O)OCH3), C(=CH-OCH3)(C(O)NHCH3), C(=N-OCH3)(C(O)OCH3) or C(=N-OCH3)(C(O)OCH3).<br>
Preferably, the optionally substituted phenyl ring is linked to an unsubstituted or substituted aromatic nitrogen heterocycle that carries at least one imino nitrogen atom as ring member via a chemical bond or a 1- to 5-memberd chain of atoms, preferably via a 2-or 3-membered chain of atoms. Generally the chain is formed by carbon atoms. However, one of the carbon atoms of the chain may be replaced by oxygen or silicon. The chain may be unsubstituted or carry 1, 2 or 3 substituents such cyano, OH, =0, C1-C4-alkyl, which may carry 1 or 2 radicals selected from OH, C1-C2-alkoxy, C1-C2-haloalkoxy, C1-C2-haloalkyl, trimethylsilyl, C3-C6-cycloalkyl and phenyl, which itself may carry 1, 2 or 3 radicals selected from halogen atoms and d-C4-alkyl, or phenyl, which may carry 1, 2 or 3 radicals selected from halogen atoms and C1-C4-alkyl, or two radials that are bound to the same atom of the chain or to two adjacent atoms of the chain may form a 3 to 6 membered saturated carbocycle or heterocycle, which carries 1 or 2 oxygen atoms as ring members, the carbocycle and the heterocycle being unsubstituted or carrying a radical selected from halogen, C1-C4-alkyl, C1-C4-haloalkyl, C1-C4-alkoxy, halo-C1-C4-alkoxy and phenyl, which itself may carry 1, 2 or 3 radicals selected from halogen atoms and C1-C4-alkyl;<br>

A very preferred embodiment of the invention relates to a crystalline complex, wherein the compound A is epoxiconazol (1UPAC: (2RS,3SR)-1-[3-(2-chlorophenyl)-2,3-epoxy-2-(4-fluorophenyl)propyl]-1 H-1,2,4-triazole).<br>
Another very preferred embodiment of the invention relates to a crystalline complex, wherein the compound A is pyraclostrobin (IUPAC: methyl {2-[1-(4-chlorophenyl)-pyrazol-3-yloxymethyl]phenyl}(methoxy)carbamate).<br>
Another very preferred embodiment of the invention relates to a crystalline complex, wherein the compound A is metconazole (IUPAC: (1RS,5RS;1RS,5SR)-5-(4-chlorobenzyl)-2,2-dimethyl-1-(1H-1,2,4-triazol-1-ylmethyl)cyclopentanol).<br>
Another very preferred embodiment of the invention relates to a crystalline complex, wherein the compound A is tritconazole (IUPAC: (RS)-(E)-5-(4-chlorobenzylidene)-2,2-dimethyl-1-(1H-1,2,4-triazol-1-ylmethyl)cyclopentanol).<br>
In the crystalline complexes according to the present invention, the molar ratio of thio-phanate methyl and the compound A is at least 0.5:1 and may vary from 0.5:1 to 3:1 and is preferably from 0.8:1 to 2.5:1 or 0.9:1 to 2.1:1. In particular, the molar ratio is from 1:1 to 2:1, however, deviations are possible, though they will generally not exceed 20 mol-% and preferably 10 %.<br>
The crystalline complexes can be distinguished from simple mixtures of crystalline thiophanate methyl and crystalline compound A by standard analytical means used for the analysis of crystalline material, including X-ray powder diffractometry (PXRD), IR spectrometry, in particular the lack of narrow absorption bands at 3350 cm-1 and 3305 cm-1, characteristic for thiophanate methyl, solid state 13C-NMR (13C-CP/MAS: cross polarization - magic angle spinning) and thermochemical analysis such as thermogra-vimetry (TGA) and differentials scanning calorimetry (DSC). Relative amounts of thio-phanate methyl and compound A can be determined e.g. by HPLC or by 1H-NMR-spectroscopy.<br>
For example, the crystalline complex of thiophanate methyl and epoxiconazol shows an X-ray powder diffractogram at 25°C (Cu-Kα-radiation, 1.54178 A) wherein the charac-teristic reflexes of the pure compounds are missing. In particular, the crystalline com-plex of thiophanate methyl and epoxiconazol shows at least 4, preferably at least 6, in particular at least 8 and more preferably all of the following reflexes, given in the following table 1 as 28 values or as lattice spacings d:<br><br>
Table 1: PXRD of the crystalline complex of thiophanate methyl and epoxiconazol (25°C, Cu-Kα-radiation, 1,54178 A)<br><br>
In the crystalline complex according to said embodiment of the present invention, the molar ratio of thiophanate methyl and epoxiconazol is from 0.9:1 to 1.1:1 and in particular about 1:1.<br>
Studies of single crystals of the crystalline complex of thiophanate methyl and epoxiconazol show that the basic crystal structure is triclinic and has the space group P-c. The structure analysis reveals that the crystalline complex is a 1:1 mixture of thiophanate methyl and epoxiconazol, the asymmetric cell containing one molecule of thiophanate methyl and epoxiconazol, each. .In the crystal, two molecules of thiophanate methyl form a dimer through intermolecular hydrogen bonds in between the N-H and C=0 groups of two adjacent thiophanate methyl molecules. The dimer appears to form two pockets which act as a receptor for two epoxiconazol molecules. It appears that there are hydrogen bonds between the nitrogen atoms of the triazole ring of the epoxiconazol molecule and the NH-groups of the thiophanate methyl molecules. Moreover, there seem to be a pi-interaction between the phenyl ring of the thiophanate methyl molecule and the fluorinated phenyl ring of the epoxiconazol molecule. This complex of two thiophanate methyl molecules and two epoxiconazol molecules forms a supramolecular synthon that is then packed in the crystal lattice to form the co-crystal. The characteristic data of the crystal structure of the complex are shown in table 2:<br>
Table 2: Crystallographic data of the crystalline complex of thiophanate methyl and epoxiconazol<br><br><br><br>
Thermogravimetric analysis shows that the melting of the crystalline complex of epoxi-conazol and thiophanate methyl starts at 148°C followed by decomposition of thio-phanate methyl.<br>
For example, the crystalline complex of thiophanate methyl and pyraclostrobin shows an X-ray powder diffractogram at 25°C (Cu-Koc-radiation, 1.54178 A) wherein the characteristic reflexes of the pure compounds are missing. In particular, the crystalline complex of thiophanate methyl and pyraclostrobin shows in an X-ray powder diffractogram at 25°C (Cu-Koc-radiation, 1.54178 A) at least 4, preferably at least 6, in particular at least 8 and more preferably all of the following reflexes, given in the following table 3 as 29 values or as lattice spacings d.<br>

13C-CP/MAS confirms the presence of a crystalline complex rather than the presence of a simple mixture of solid thiophanate methyl and solid pyraclostrobin. In particular, the 13C-CP/MAS of the crystalline complexes (CP = 3 ms, D1 = 30 s, 25°C, RO 5700 Hz).shows chemical shifts at 5 182.0, 180.8, 178.7, 177.7,164.3,158.8, 154.9, 154.0, 152.1 139.4, 137.9, 134.3, 131.2,130.2, 127.6, 125.9, 123.8, 117.7, 115.6,94.3,65.7, 63.0, 58.8, 54.3, 53.6 and 52,6. The shifts 164.3, 158.8 ppm are most characteristic and lack in the 13C-CP/MAS of thiophanate methyl and pyraclostrobin. Polarisation transfer experiments from the protons to 13C confirm that thiophanate methyl and pyraclostrobin are present as a co-crystal and not as a mixture of crystalline material of the pure compounds.<br>
In the crystalline complex according to said embodiment of the present invention, the molar ratio of thiophanate methyl and pyraclostrobin may vary from 1.1:1 to2.5:1, and is in particular from 1.9:1 to 2.1:1, especially about 2:1.<br>
Thermogravimetric analysis shows that the meltingpoint of the crystalline complex of pyraclostrobin and thiophanate methyl is about 150°C.<br>
For example, the crystalline complex of thiophanate methyl and metconazol shows an X-ray powder diffractogram at 25°C (Cu-Ka-radiation, 1.54178 A) wherein the characteristic reflexes of the pure compounds are missing. In particular, the crystalline complex of thiophanate methyl and epoxiconazol shows at least 4, preferably at least 6, in particular at least 8 and more preferably all of the following reflexes, given in the following table 4 as 29 values or as lattice spacings d:<br>

In the crystalline complex according to said embodiment of the present invention, the molar ratio of thiophanate methyl and metconazol is from 0.9:1 to 1.1:1 and in particular about 1:1.<br>
Studies of single crystals of the crystalline complex of thiophanate methyl and metconazol show that the basic crystal structure is monoclinic and has the space group P2(1)/c. The structure analysis reveals that the crystalline complex is a 1:1 mixture of thiophanate methyl and metconazol, the asymmetric cell containing one molecule of thiophanate methyl and metconazol, each. It appears that there are hydrogen bonds between the nitrogen atoms of the triazole ring of the metconazol molecule and the NH-groups of the thiophanate methyl molecules. The characteristic data of the crystal structure of the complex are shown in table 5:<br>
Table 5: Crystallographic data of the crystalline complex of thiophanate methyl and metconazol (-170°C)<br><br>
The DSC-measurement of the crystalline complex of metconazole and thiophanate methyl shows an endothermic melting peak with onset at 155 to 158°C and peak maximum at 160-168°C. This is about 60 degrees higher than the pure crystalline metconazole (100°C, as reported in Pesticide Manual) and about 10 to20°C lower than the melting point of thiophanate-methyl.<br>
The crystalline complexes of the present invention can be prepared by co-crystallizing thiophanate-methyl and at least one; compound A from a solution or slurry or from a<br><br>
melt containing thiophanate-methyl and at least one compound A. Likewise, it is possible to prepare the crystalline complexes of the present invention, by grinding a mixture of the compound A and thiophanate methyl at elevated temperature, e.g. above 30°C, preferably at a temperature of at least 40°C, in particular of at least 50°C, more preferably of at least 55°C, e.g. from &gt;30°Cto 110°C, preferably from 40°C to 100°C, in particular from 50°C to 90°C or from 55°C to 90°C. The compound A may be solid at the grinding temperature. However, this is not necessary and it might be advantageous if the temperature is close to or above the melting point of the compound A.<br>
In a preferred embodiment the crystalline complex is thiophanate-methyl and at least one compound A is obtained from a slurry of thiophanate-methyl and the at least one compound A in an organic solvent or in a mixture of water and organic solvent. Consequently, this method comprises suspending thiophanate-methyl and the active compound A in an organic solvent or in a mixture of water and an organic solvent (Slurry process).<br>
Preferred organic solvents for the slurry process are those, which are at least partially water miscible, i.e. which have miscibility with water of at least 10 % v/v, more preferably at least 20 % v/v at room temperature, mixtures thereof and mixtures of said water miscible solvents with organic solvents that have miscibility with water of less than 10 % v/v at room temperature. Preferably the organic solvent comprises at least 80 % v/v, based on the total amount of organic solvent, of the at least one water miscible solvent.<br>
Suitable solvents having a water miscibility of at least 10 % at room temperature include, but are not limited to:<br>
1.	C1-C4-Alkanols such as methanol, ethanol, n-propanol or isopropanol;<br>
2.	Amides, N-methylamides and N,N-dimethylamides of C1-C3-carboxylic acids such as formamide, dimethylformamide (DMF), acetamide and N,N-dimethylacetamide;<br>
3.	5 or 6-membered lactames with a total of 7 carbon atoms such as pyrrolidone, N-methylpyrrolidone, N-ethylpyrrolidone, N-isopropyipyrrolidone, N-hydroxyethylpyrrolidone;<br>
4.	Dimethylsulfoxid and sulfolane;<br>

More preference is given to organic solvents of the groups 1, 6, 8 and 9, and to their mixtures with water. In the mixtures with water the relative amount of organic solvent and water may vary from 10:1 to 1:10, in particular from 2:1 to 1:5.<br>
The slurry process can by simply performed by suspending thiophanate methyl and the at least one compound A in the organic solvent or solvent/water mixture. The relative amounts of thiophanate methyl, the at least one compound A and solvent or solvent/water mixture will be chosen to obtain a suspension at the given temperature. Complete dissolution of thiophanate methyl and the at least one compound A should be avoided. In particular thiophanate methyl and the at least one compound A are suspended in an amount from 50 to 800 g, more preferably 100 to 600 g per litre of solvent or solvent/water mixture.<br>
The relative molar amount of thiophanate methyl and the at least one compound A may vary from 1:2 to 20:1, preferably from 1:1 to15:1. If one of the components is in excess with regard to the stoichiometry of the crystalline complex, a mixture of the crystalline complex and the compound being in excess might be obtained, though a minor excess might remain dissolved in the mother liquor. For formulation purposes, the presence of an excess of compound A or thiophanate methyl might be acceptable. In particular the presence of an excess of thiophanate methyl does not cause stability problems. For preparing the pure crystalline complex, thiophanate methyl and compound A will be used in a relative molar amount which is close to the stoichiometry of the complex to be formed and which usually will not deviate more than 50 mol.-%, based on the stoichiometrically required amount.<br>
The slurry process is usually performed at a temperature of at least 10°C, preferably at least 20°C and in particular at least 30°C, e.g. from 20 to 90°C, preferably from 30 to 85°C, in particular from 40 to 70°C.<br>
The time required for formation of the crystalline complex by the slurry process depends on the temperature, the type of solvent and is generally at least 12 h. In any case, complete conversion is achieved after one week, however, the complete conversion will usually require not more than 24 h.<br>
In another preferred embodiment of the invention the crystalline complex is prepared by applying shear forces to a liquid which contains suspended particles of thiophanate-<br><br>
methyl and active compound A at a temperature of at least 30 °C until the crystalline complex has been formed (shear process).<br>
In the liquid, thiophanate methyl and the at least one compound A are present as particles, which are suspended in a liquid medium. Upon applying shear forces to the liquid at elevated temperatures the formation of the crystalline complex takes place.<br>
The main constituent of the liquid medium is water or an organic solvent, in which thiophanate methyl and the compound A is practically insoluble, i.e. the solubility at 25 °C is less than 5 g/l, in particular less than 1 g/l. Suitable organic solvents include aliphatic hydrocarbons, mineral spirits, plant oils and plant oil esters. In a preferred embodiment, the liquid medium contains water or a mixture of water with up to 20 % v/v of a water miscible solvent, in particular a solvent of the group 1. or 9, as main constituent. Apart from that, the liquid medium may also contain additives which are usually present in a liquid suspension concentrates.<br>
The liquid medium may contain thiophanate methyl and the crystalline compound A in an amount from 5 to 70 % by weight, in particular from 10 to 60 % by weight and more preferably from 15 to 50 % by weight, based on the total weight of the liquid medium, the compound A and thiophanate methyl.<br>
The liquid medium may contain thiophanate methyl and the crystalline compound A in a relative molar amount of thiophanate methyl and the at least one compound A varying from 1:2 to 20:1, preferably from 1:1 to 15:1. If one of the components is in excess with regard to the stoichiometry of the crystalline complex, a mixture of the crystalline complex and the compound being in excess will be obtained. For formulation purposes, the presence of an excess of compound A or thiophanate methyl might be acceptable. In particular the presence of an excess of thiophanate methyl does not cause stability problems. Likewise, the presence of an excess of compound A does usually not cause stability problems. However, it is preferred, that a formulation does not contain both uncomplexed thiophanate methyl and uncomplexed compound A in amounts of more than 20 % by weight each, nor in particular in amounts of more than 10 % by weight each, based on the amount of compound A and thiophanate present in the form of the crystalline complex, in order to avoid uncontrolled formation of the complex in the formulation. Therefore, the present invention relates in particular to formulations containing the crystalline complex of the present invention, provided that, if both compounds A and thiophanate are present in the formulation in non-complexed form, the amount of the compound A does not exceed 20 % by weight, in particular 10 % by weight, based on the amount of complex in the formulation, and at the same time, the amount of thiophanate methyl does not exceed 20 % by weight, in particular 10 % by weight, based on the amount of complex in the formulation.<br><br>
The liquid medium may include additives which are usually present in a liquid suspension concentrate. Suitable additives are described hereinafter and include surfactants, in particular anionic or non-ionic emulsifiers, wetting agents and dispersants usually employed in crop protection compositions, furthermore antifoam agents, antifreeze agents, agents for adjusting the pH, stabilizers, anticaking agents, dyes and biocides (preservatives). Preferably, the liquid medium does not contain viscosity-modifying additives (thickeners). The amount of surfactants will generally be from 0.5 to 20% by weight, in particular from 1 to 15% by weight and particularly preferably from 1 to 10% by weight, based on the total weight of the liquid medium, the compound A and thio-phanate methyl. The amount of anti-freeze agents may be up to 10 % by weight, in particular up to 20 % by weight, e.g. from 0.5 to 20 % by weight, in particular from 1 to 10 % by weight, based on the total weight of the liquid medium, the compound A and thiophanate methyl. Further additives, apart from anti-freeze agents and surfactants, may be present in amounts from 0 to 5 % by weight, based on the total weight of the liquid medium, the compound A and thiophanate methyl.<br>
The temperature required for formation of the crystalline complex is generally at least 30°C, preferably at least 35°C and in particular at least 40°C, more preferably at least 50°C, especially at least 55°C, e.g. from 30 to 100°C, preferably from 35 to 100°C, in particular from 40 to 100°C, more preferably from 50 to 90°C and especially from 55 to 80°C.<br>
The time required for formation of the crystalline complex depends in a manner known per se on the type of shear process and the temperature and can be determined by the person skilled in the art in standard experiments. Shearing times in the range of e.g. from 30 min. to 48 hours have been found to be suitable, although a longer period of time is also conceivable. A shearing time of 1 to 24 hours is preferred.<br>
Shear forces can be applied by suitable techniques, which are capable of providing sufficient shear to bring the particles of thiophanate methyl and the at least one compound A into an intimate contact. Suitable techniques include grinding, crushing or milling, in particular by wet grinding or wet milling, including e.g. bead milling or by use of a colloid mill. Suitable shearing devices include in particular ball mills or bead mills, agitator ball mills, circulating mills (agitator ball mills with pin grinding system), disk mills, annular chamber mills, double cone mills, triple roll mills, batch mills, colloid mills, and media mills, such as sand mills. To dissipate the heat energy introduced during the grinding process, the grinding chambers are preferably fitted with cooling systems. Particularly suitable is the ball mill Drais Superflow DCP SF 12 from DRAISWERKE, INC.40 Whitney Road. Mahwah, NJ 07430 USA, a Drais Perl Mill PMC from DRAISWERKE, INC., the circulating mill system ZETAfrom Netzsch-Feinmahltechnik GmbH, the disk mill from Netzsch Feinmahltechnik GmbH, Selb, Germany, the bead mill Eiger Mini 50 from Eiger Machinery, Inc., 888 East Belvidere Rd., Grayslake, IL<br><br>

In a preferred embodiment of the invention, shear is applied by bead milling. In particular, bead sizes in the range of from 0.05 to 5 mm, more particularly from 0.2 to 2.5 mm, and most particularly from 0.5 to 1.5 mm have been found to be suitable. In general, bead loadings in the range of from 40 to 99 %, particularly from 70 to 97 %, and more particularly from 65 to 95 % may be used.<br>
After having applied sufficient shear forces a suspension of the crystalline complex, optionally in admixture with excess thiophanate methyl or active compound A, is obtained, wherein 90 % by weight of the suspended particles have the particle size of not more than 30 urn, preferably not more than 20 urn, in particular not more than 10 urn especially not more than 5 urn, as determined by dynamic light scattering.<br>
The thus obtained liquid suspension of the crystalline complex can, after, or in particular before a formulation with additives, be converted by customary drying methods, in particular by spray-drying or freeze-drying, into powder compositions. Before or during drying, a drying or spray auxiliary may be added. Suitable drying or spray auxiliaries for drying aqueous dispersions are known. These include protective colloids, such as polyvinyl alcohol, in particular polyvinyl alcohol having a degree of hydrolysis of &gt; 70%, carboxylated polyvinyl alcohol, phenolsulfonic acid/formaldehyde condensates, phenol-sulfonic acid/urea/formaldehyde condensates, naphthalenesulfonic acid/formaldehyde condensates, naphthalenesulfonic acid/formaldehyde/urea condensates, polyvinylpyrrolidone, copolymers of maleic acid (or maleic anhydride) and vinylaromatics such as styrene and ethoxylated derivatives thereof, copolymers of maleic acid or maleic anhydride with C2-Cio-olefins, such as diisobutene, and ethoxylated derivatives thereof, cationic polymers, for example homo- and copolymers of N-alkyl-N-vinylimidazolinium compounds with N-vinyl lactams and the like, and also inorganic anti-blocking agents (sometimes also termed as anti-caking agents), such as silicic acid, in particular pyro-genic silica, alumina, calcium carbonate and the like. The drying auxiliaries are usually employed in an amount of from 0.1 to 20% by weight, based on the weight of the active compound particles in the liquid pesticide composition of the present invention.<br>

Analysis:<br>
The pictures of the X-ray powder diffractograms (PXRD) were taken using a D-5000 diffractometer from Siemens in reflection geometry in the range from 29 = 4° - 35° with increments of 0.02° using Cu-Ka radiation at 25°C. The 29 values found were used to calculate the stated interplanar spacing d.<br>
Single crystal X-ray diffraction. The data were collected at 103(2) K on a Bruker AXS CCD Detector, using graphite-monochromated CuKa radiation (A = 1.54178 A). The structure was solved with direct methods, refined, and expanded by using Fourier techniques with the SHELX-97 software package.<br>
Thermogravimetric/differential thermal analyses were carried out with a Mettler Toledo TGA/SDTA 851 using AI2O3 as reference. The samples (8-22 mg) were placed in platinum sample cups for measurement. A temperature program from 30 to 605°C at 10°C/min and N2 gas flow was used.<br>
Differential scanning calorimetric determinations (DSC) were made on a Mettler Toledo DSC 823e with TS0801RO Sample Robot and TS08006C1 Gas Control. The measurements were done with heating rates 5 °C/min from 30 to 185°C using aluminum crucibles with pinholes.<br>
13C-CP/MAS measurements were run on a BRUKER Avance 300 instrument linked to a 7T wide bore magnet, 13C resonance frequency was 75.47 MHz. A Bruker MAS probe with 7 mm o.d. Zr02 rotors, spinning at 5700 Hz was used (this produces spinning side bands spaced 75.5 ppm from the isotropic signal). 13C spectra were generated by cross-polarization (Hartmann-Hahn contact 3ms, Bi= 45 kHz), acquisition time 35 ms, TPPM modulated decoupling (Bi=45 kHz) during acquisition, waiting time 2s up to 120s, depending on the suspected (or measured) longitudianl relaxation time T-i(H) of the protons; number of scans 500 to 10 000, depending on the waiting time used. The ppm scale was externally calibrated, setting the low field signal of adamantane to 38.066 ppm. A typical measurement, on the "mixed crystal" for example, involved 500 scans with a waiting time of 120 s between the scans, thus using a total time of measurement of 17 hrs.<br><br>
The IR spectra of the samples were measured from KBr tablets on a Thermo Nicolet Nexus 470 IR spectrometer with a DTGS KBr detector.<br>
The particle sizes in the suspension concentrates were determined using a Mastersizer 2000 from Malvern Instruments GmbH.<br>
Epoxiconazol was used as a racemic mixture. It is known to exist in monoclincic crystalline form I that is thermodynamically stable at 22°C. A single crystal structure of Form I has been determined (monoclinic, space group P21/n, a = 5.396 A, b = 17.304 A, c = 16.568 A, p = 91.742°). The experimental PXRD data is given in figure 2. Form I has a melting range from 130 to 140°C.<br>
Thiophanate methyl is known to exist in monoclincic crystalline form that is thermodynamically stable at 22°C.X-ray analysis of single crystal reveals a monoclinic unit cell (space group P21/n) with dimensions a=10,715 A, b=11,548 A, c=11,548 A and (3=90,49°. Thiophanate-M decomposes directly after melting (m.p. ~180°C for Form I).<br>
Pyraclostrobin is known to exist in for different polymorphs as described in WO 2006/136357. For the following experiments, polymorph IV was used (see PXRD in figure 3).<br>
Preparation examples<br>
I Slurry method:<br>
Example 1:1 g of thiophanate methyl and 1.13 g of epoxiconazol (1:1 molar ratio) were given in a round bottomed flask together with 20 ml of mixture of propanediol and water (1:3 v/v). The obtained slurry was stirred for one week at 50°C, after which the mixture was cooled to 22°C, filtered and dried at 22°C on a clay plate. An PXRD revealed that the obtained crystalline material was a co-crystal of thiophanate methyl and epoxiconazol (figure 4). Melting of the crystalline complex begins at 148°C<br>
Examples 2 to 6: The process of example 1 was repeated by using different solvents or solvent water mixures and applying different temperatures as given below:<br>
Exp. 2: 1:3 glycerine:water (50°C)<br>
Exp. 3: 1:3 propylene carbonate:water (50°C)<br>
Exp. 4: 1:3 propylene carbonate:water (22°C)<br>
Exp. 5: 1:3 isopropanohwater (50°C)<br>
Exp. 6: Ethanol (22°C)<br><br>
In any of examples 2 to 6 a crystalline material was obtained, which was identified by PXRD as being the crystalline complex of thiophanate methyl and epoxiconazol.<br>
Example 7: 2 g of thiophanate methyl and 0.96 g of pyraclostrobin (2:1 molar ratio) were given in a round bottomed flask together with 20 ml of mixture of propanediol and water (1:3 v/v). The obtained slurry was stirred for one week at 50°C, after which the mixture was cooled to 22°C, filtered and dried at 22°C on a clay plate. An PXRD revealed that the obtained crystalline material was a co-crystal of thiophanate methyl and pyraclostrobin (figure 5). The obtained material was identified by PXRD as being the crystalline complex of thiophanate methyl and pyraclostrobin.<br>
Examples 8 to 10: The process of example 7 was repeated by using different solvents or solvent water mixures and applying different temperatures as given below:<br>
Exp. 8: 1:3 glycerine:water (50°C)<br>
Exp. 9: 1:3 propylene carbonate:water (50°C)<br>
Exp. 10: 1:3 propylene carbonate:water (22°C)<br>
In any of examples 8 to 10 a crystalline material was obtained, which was identified by PXRD as being the crystalline complex of thiophanate methyl and pyraclostrobin.<br>
13C-CP/MAS of the material obtained from examples 7 to 10 confirmed the presence of a co-crystal rather than a mixture of the individual crystalline materials. In particular, pyrachlostrobin and methylthiophanate relax with the sameTi(H): A presaturation of the 1H followed by a variable waiting delay allows for partial relaxation of the protons. This polarization was transferred from 1H to 13C via cross-polarization. The amplitudes of the 13C signals of pyrachlostrobin and of methylthiophanate then reflect the growing polarization of the 1H reservoir seen by each of the two types of molecules. Pyrachlostrobin and methylthiophanate showed identical 1H relaxation indication that both were coupled to the same 1H reservoir and thus must neighbors. The signals of both components relaxed identically, i.e. the whole spectrum scales as the 1H reservoir relaxes. Spectra taken at different delays (20s and 120 s res.) were different by a factor of two in absolute intensity but fully fit onto each other after scaling. Ti relaxation of the protons was 34.4 s (pure thiophanate methyl 28.6 s, pure pyraclostrobin 7.0 s).<br>

Example 14: A sample of 2 kg was prepared according to the same recipe and same procedure as in example 3, except that the mixture was heated to 45°C before the milling was started and kept at this temperature during milling for 4 hours. A homogeneous, slightly viscous, colourless opaque liquid was obtained. The particle size of this dispersion was determined according to example 11 to show a D90 value of 1,5 urn.<br>
Storage stability:<br>
The stability of the samples produced in examples 1,2,3 and 4 were determined by storing a sub-sample of 100 ml in a HDPE bottle for a defined period at a defined temperature. A typical storage test would be for 8 weeks at 40°C. After storage, the particle size was determined both by laser-diffraction on a ~100-fold dilution and by determining the residue on a 150 pm wet-sieve.<br>
Typically a good suspension quality is characterised by a D90 
 <br><br><br>
Example 15 (comparative): About 350 g of demineralised water were placed in a vessel. Thereto, 100 g of propylene glycol, 20 g of a dispersant 1, 30 g of dispersant 4, 2 g of a milling aid (amorphous silica) and 2 g of a defoamer (aq. emulsion of a silicon oil) were added. The mixture was stirred at 25°C for 15 min. with a stirring speed of 1000 rpm. Then, 200 g of epoxiconazol and 300 g of thiophanate methyl were added with stirring at 1000 rpm. The mixture was then milled in a bead mill as described in example 11 until at least 80 % by weight of the particles had a diameter below 2 urn, while keeping the mixture at 10 °C. To the obtained mixture a 2% aqueous solution of xan-than gum and 2 g of a biocide formulation were added. A homogeneous slightly viscous liquid was obtained. The particle size of this dispersion was determined by laser-diffraction of a 100-fold dilution in water to show 80% of the particles to have a size below 2 urn (Dgo value). A PXRD of the solid showed a physical mixture of epoxiconazol and thiophanate methyl.<br>
After 1 week storage at 60°C, the mixture became highly viscous and the laser-diffraction of a 100-fold dilution of the thickened liquid in water showed that less than 25 % of the particles had a particle size below 2 urn (D90 value).<br>
Example 16: A formulation of epoxiconazol and thiophanate methyl was prepared according to the general recipe and similar to the procedure described in example 15, but performing the milling at 50°C instead of 10°C. The particle size of this dispersion was determined by laser-diffraction of a 100-fold dilution in water to show 90% of the particles to have a size below 2 urn (D90 value). A PXRD of the solids showed that the material was the crystalline complex of epoxiconazol and thiophanate methyl.<br><br>
After 1 week storage at 60°C, the viscosity mixture was similar to the viscosity of the freshly prepared liquid and the laser-diffraction of a 100-fold dilution of the thickened liquid in water showed that 90 % of the particles had a particle size below 2 urn (Dgo value).<br>
Example 17: 1 g of a mixture of metconazole and thiophanate-methyl (1:1 molar ratio) was placed in a round bottom flask and slurried in 20 ml of glycerine at 50°C for 2 days. The mixture was cooled slowly to room temperature, filtrated and left to dry on a clay plate for some hours. The solid was analyzed by PXRD (see Figure 8) to be &gt; 95 - % pure co-crystals of metconazole and thiophanate-methyl. The DSC-measurement of the material showed an endothermic melting peak with onset at 155-158°C and peak maximum at 160-168°C. The IR-spectrum is shown in figure 10.<br>
Example 18: 2 g of a mixture of metconazole and thiophanate-methyl (1:1 molar ratio) was dissolved in 50 ml acetonitrile by gentle heating and stirring. The solution was filtered and the filtrate was left to evaporate in an open flask. After 1 day quadrate formed crystals large enough for single crystal X-ray analysis were achieved. The structure solution revealed a 1:1 co-crystal of metconazole and thiophanate-methyl. The experiment was repeated in ethyl acetate and nitromethane with similar results.<br>
Example 19: 32 parts by weight of thiophanate-methyl and 6 parts by weight of metconazole were slurried in a mixture of 50 parts by weight of water, 8 parts by weight of glycerine, 2 parts by weight of dispersant 1 and 2 parts by weight of dispersant 2. This mixture was mechanically milled in a colloid mill for 4 hours at 65 °C. The slurry was left to cool down and after sedimentation of solid material the supernatant was decanted. The sediment was dried and analysed by IR to show the presence of co-crystal of thiophanate methyl and metconazol.<br><br>
