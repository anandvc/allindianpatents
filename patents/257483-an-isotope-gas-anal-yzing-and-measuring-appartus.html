GAS INJECTION AMOUNT DETERMINING METHOD IN ISOTOPE GAS<br>
ANALYSIS, AND, ISOTOPE GAS ANALYZING AND MEASURING METHOD<br>
AND APPARATUS<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
After a medicine containing isotopes has been administered<br>
to a living body, the metabolic rate of the living<br>
body can be measured by measuring changes in concentration<br>
re:io of the isotopes. Accordingly, isotope analysis is<br>
utilized for disease diagnosis in the medical field.<br>
The present invention is achieved with attention<br>
focused on the difference in light absorption characteristics<br>
of isotopes, and relates to a gas injection amount<br>
determining method in isotope gas analysis for measuring<br>
the concentration ratio of isotope gases, and also relates<br>
to isotope gas analyzing and measuring method and apparatus <br>
Description of Related Art<br>
It is generally known that bacteria called<br>
Helicobacter pylori (HP) are present in the stomach as the<br>
cause of gastric ulcer and gastritis.<br>
When HP is present in the patient's stomach, it is<br>
required to conduct a bacteria elimination treatment by<br>
administering a:i antibiotic substance. Accordingly it is<br>
important whether or not HP is present in the patient. HP<br>
presents a strong urease activity and therefore dissolves<br>
urea into carbon dioxide and ammonia.<br>
On the other hand, carbon includes isotopes of which<br>
mass number is 13 and 14, in addition to 12. Out of these<br>
isotopes, the isotope 13C having the mass number of 13 is<br>
not radioactive and is sable, thus causing the same to be<br>
readily handled.<br>
In this connection, when urea marked with the isotope<br>
13C is administered to a living body (patient), and t \e 1JC<br>
concentration, more specifically the concentration ratio<br>
between 13CO2 and 12CO2, in the expired breath of the patient<br>
which is the final metabolic product, is measures, the<br>
presence/absence of HP can be made sure.<br>
However, the concentration ratio between 13C02 and 12C02<br>
in the natural world, is as high as 1:100. It is therefore<br>
difficult to precisely measure the concentration ratio in<br>
the expired breath of the patient.<br>
Conventionally, it is known a method using infrared<br>
spectral diffraction as a method of obtaining the concentration<br>
ratio between 13C02 and 12C02 or the concentration<br>
of 13C02 (See Japanese Patent Publication Mo.<br>
61(1986)-42220(B)}.<br>
According to the method of Japanese Patent Publication<br>
No. 61 (1986) -42220 (B) , there are prepared two, long and short,<br>
cells having lengths such that the 12C02 absorption in one<br>
cell is equal to the UCO2 absorption in the other cell, and<br>
lights having wavelengths suitable for respective analyses<br>
are irradiated to the respective cells, and the intensities<br>
of the transmitted lights are measured. According to this<br>
method, the light absorption ratio at the concentration ratio<br>
in the natural field can be made 1, and if the concentration<br>
ratio undergoes a change, the light absorption ratio varies<br>
according to this change. Thus, the change in concentration<br>
ratio can be known.<br>
Even though there is adopted the method using infrared<br>
spectral diffraction above-mentioned, it is difficult to<br>
detect a slight change in concentration ratio.<br>
According to the isotope gas analyzing and measuring<br>
method above-mentioned, the concentration of carbon dioxide<br>
"CQz is obtained with the use of a calibration curve which<br>
determines the relationship between absorbance and concentration<br>
of 13C02. However, if the atmospheric pressure<br>
at which the calibration curve has been prepared, is different<br>
from the atmospheric pressure at which the absorbance of<br>
carbon dioxide 13C02 is measured, such difference may cause<br>
an error of measurement of 13C02 concentration.<br>
Table 1 shows the results of measurement of C02<br>
concentration obtained in the following manner. That is,<br>
a predetermined volume of air having a predetermined C02<br>
concentration, was collected by a gas injection device at<br>
each of a plurality of atmospheric pressures, and was then<br>
injected into a cell. Each cell inside pressure was measured<br>
Then, each absorbance was measured to measure the C02<br>
concentration. The calibration curve used at this time was<br>
prepared at an atmospheric pressure of 1005hPa.<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
According to Table 1, the cell inside pressures are<br>
naturally proportional to the atmospheric pressures, and<br>
the COs concentrations which must originally be constant,<br>
are lowered according to the reduction in atmospheric<br>
pressure. Thus, the concentration varies with the<br>
variations of the atmospheric pressure.<br>
In measurement in which gas to be measured containing,<br>
as gas components, carbon dioxide 13CO2 and carbon dioxide<br>
12C02, is introduced into a cell, and in which the intensities<br>
of transmitted lights having wavelengths suitable for<br>
measurement of the respective gas components, are measured<br>
and then data-processed to measure the concentrations of<br>
the gas components, it is an object of the present invention<br>
to provide a gas injection amount determining method in<br>
isotope gas analysis, and isotope gas analyzing/measuring<br>
method and apparatus, each of which can correct concentration<br>
variations resulting from the atmospheric pressure<br>
variations, thus improving the measuring precision.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
According to the present invention, a gas injection<br>
amount determining method in isotope gas analysis comprises<br>
the steps of: filling a cell with the air at an atmospheric<br>
pressure; operating a gas injection device so as to suck<br>
the air of a predetermined volume Va, the gas injection device<br>
being arranged to inject the gas to be measured into the<br>
cell; transferring the air stored in the gas injection device<br>
into the cell to pressurize the cell inside, and measuring<br>
the cell inside pressure P; and subtracting the cell volume<br>
Vc from the product obtained by multiplying the sum VO of<br>
the volume Va and the cell volume Vc, by the ratio PO/P in<br>
which PO is the target pressure of the gas to be measured<br>
in isotope gas analysis measurement, thus determining the<br>
one-time gas injection amount of the gas injection device.<br>
According to the method above-mentioned, when an<br>
isotope gas analysis measurement is conducted with the use<br>
of the one-time gas injection amount determined by multiplying<br>
the ratio PO/P with the standard volume or sum VO<br>
of the volume Va and the cell volume Vc, the gas to be measured<br>
can be measured at the target pressure PO of the gas to be<br>
measured. In other words, the cell inside pressure influenced<br>
by variations of the atmospheric pressure can be<br>
corrected.<br>
Accordingly, the measuring precision and the reproducibility<br>
are improved. Further, the measuring apparatus<br>
is not required to be made in large sizes.<br>
It is preferable that the cell volume Vc includes not<br>
only net volume of the cell, but also inner volumes of pipes,<br>
valves and pressure sensor which are in connection through<br>
the cell. With use of the above volume Vc, more precise<br>
measurement can be attained.<br>
The target pressure PO of the gas to be measured is<br>
preferably equal to the gas pressure at which a calibration<br>
curve for determining the relationship between absorbance<br>
and concentration of carbon dioxide 13C02, has been prepared.<br>
According to an isotope gas analyzing and measuring<br>
method of the present invention, gas to be measured having<br>
the volume determined by the gas inj ection amount determining<br>
method above-mentioned, is collected by a gas injection<br>
device, the gas thus collected is transferred into the cell<br>
to pressurize the cell inside, and the concentration of the<br>
carbon dioxide 13CO2 or the concentration ratio 13C02/12C02<br>
is measured.<br>
An isotope gas analyzing and measuring apparatus of<br>
the present invention is arranged to embody the isotope gas<br>
analyzing and measuring method above-mentioned, and<br>
comprises: a gas injection device for injecting gas into<br>
acell/ gas transferringmeans for transferring the gas stored<br>
in the gas injection device into the cell; a pressure sensor<br>
for measuring the pressure of the gas housed in the cell;<br>
and gas injection amount determining means arranged such<br>
that the air having a predetermined volume Va is sucked by<br>
the gas injection device, that the air stored in the gas<br>
injection device is transferred to the cell filled with the<br>
air at an atmospheric pressure , thereby to pressurize the<br>
cell inside, that the cell inside pressure P is measured,<br>
and that the cell volume Vc is subtracted from the product<br>
obtained by multiplying the sum VO of the volume Va and the<br>
cell volume Vc, by the ratio PO/P in which PO is the target<br>
pressure of the gas to be measured in isotope gas analysis<br>
measurement/ thus determining the one-time gas injection<br>
amount of the gas inj ection device; whereby gas to be measured<br>
having the volume determined by the gas injection amount<br>
determining means, is collected by the gas injection device,<br>
the. gas thus collected is transferred into the cell filled<br>
with gas to be measured at an atmospheric pressure, and the<br>
concentration of carbon dioxide 13C02 or the concentration<br>
ratio 13C02/12C02 is measured.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Referring to the attached drawings, the following<br>
description will discuss in detail an embodiment of the<br>
present invention in which after a urea diagnostic medicine<br>
marked with an isotope 13C has been administered to a living<br>
body, the 13C02 concentration of an expired breath of the<br>
living body is spectroscopically measured.<br>
I. Expired Breath Test<br>
First, an expired breath of a patient before a urea<br>
diagnostic medicine is administered, is collected in an<br>
expired breath bag. Then, a urea diagnostic medicine is<br>
orally administered to the patient. After the passage of<br>
about 20 minutes, an expired breath is collected in an expired<br>
breath bag in a manner similar to that before administration.<br>
The expired breath bags before and after administration<br>
are respectively set to predetermined nozzles of<br>
an isotope gas spectroscopic measurement apparatus. Then,<br>
the following, automatic measurement is conducted.<br>
II. Isotope Gas Spectroscopic Measurement Apparatus<br>
Fig. 1 is a block diagram illustrating the general<br>
arrangement of an isotope gas spectroscopic measurement<br>
apparatus.<br>
The expired breath bag containing the expired breath<br>
after administration (hereinafter referred to as "sample<br>
gas")f and the expired breath bag containing the expired<br>
breath before administration (hereinafter referred to as<br>
"base gas"), are respectively set to nozzles Nl andN2. The<br>
nozzle Nl is connected to an electromagnetic valve<br>
(hereinafter simply referred to as "valve") V4 through a<br>
metallic pipe (hereinafter simply referred to as "pipe") .<br>
The nozzle N2 is connected to a valve V3 through a pipe.<br>
A valve V5 is connected to a pipe for taking in the air through<br>
a dust-proof filter 15.<br>
On the other hand, a reference gas (In this embodiment,<br>
the air with C02 removed is used) supplied from a reference<br>
gas supply unit 30 (to be discussed later), is supplied to<br>
a valve V1.<br>
The valves V1, V3, V4 and V5 are connected to the gas<br>
inj ection device 21 for quantitatively inj ecting a reference<br>
gas, a sample gas or a base gas. The gas injection device<br>
21 has a syringe shape having a piston and a cylinder. The<br>
piston is driven by a feed screw 21e connected to a pulse<br>
motor 21f in association with a nut 21d fixed to the piston<br>
(to be discussed later) . The maximum gas injection amount<br>
of the gas injection device 21 is 40 ml.<br>
The gas injection device 21 is connected, through a<br>
valve V2, to a first sample cell lla and a second sample<br>
cell lib.<br>
As shown in Fig. 1, the cell chamber 11 has the short<br>
first sample cell lla for measuring the 12C02 absorption,<br>
the long second sample cell 11b for measuring the 13C02<br>
absorption, and a dummy cell 11c containing gas which is<br>
not absorbed in the CO2 absorbing range. Provision is made<br>
such that the first sample cell lla and the second sample<br>
cell 11b communicate with each other, and that gas introduced<br>
into the first sample cell lla enters, as it is, the second<br>
sample cell 11b, and is then discharged through an exhaust<br>
valve V6.<br>
Disposed upstream of the exhaust valve V6 is a pressure<br>
sensor 16 for measuring the gas pressure in the first sample<br>
cell lla and the second sample cell 11b. No restrictions<br>
are imposed on the detection method of this pressure sensor<br>
16, but there may be used for example a pressure sensor of<br>
the type in which the movement of a diaphragm is detected<br>
by a piezoelectric element.<br>
The first sample cell lla has a capacity of about 0 085<br>
ml, while the second sample cell 11b has a capacity of about<br>
3.96 ml. More specifically, the first sample cell lla has<br>
a length of 3 mm, the second sample cell 11b has a length<br>
of 140 mm, and the dummy cell 11c has a length of 135 mm.<br>
The cell chamber 11 is surrounded by an insulating material<br>
(not shown).<br>
There is also disposed an infrared light source device<br>
L having two light sources for irradiating infrared rays.<br>
Infrared rays may be generated by an optional method. For<br>
example, there may be used a ceramics heater (surface<br>
temperature of 700°C) or the like. There is further disposed<br>
a chopper 22 for interrupting and passing infrared rays at<br>
predetermined intervals. The chopper 22 is rotated by a<br>
pulse motor 23.<br>
Out of the infrared rays irradiated from the infrared<br>
light source device L, the light path formed by infrared<br>
rays passing through the first sample cell lla and the dummy<br>
cell 11c, is called a first light path L1, and the light<br>
path f ormedby infrared rays passing through the second sample<br>
cell 11b, is called a second light path L2 (See Fig. 1) .<br>
An infrared rays detector device for detecting the<br>
infrared rays having passed through the cells comprises:<br>
a first wavelength filter 24a and a first sensor element<br>
25a disposed in the first light path; and a second wavelength<br>
filter 24b and a second sensor element 25b disposed in the<br>
second light path.<br>
For measuring the absorption of 12CO2, the first<br>
wavelength f ilter 24a is designed to pass infrared ray shaving<br>
a wavelength of about 4280 nm which is the 12C02 absorption<br>
wavelength range. For measuring the absorption of 13C02,<br>
the second wavelength filter 24b is designed to pass infrared<br>
rays having a wavelength of about 4412 nm which is the 13C02<br>
absorption wavelength range. The first and second sensor<br>
elements 25a, 25b are light-receiving elements for detecting<br>
infrared rays.<br>
The first wavelength filter 24a, the first sensor<br>
element 25a, the second wavelength filter 24b, and the second<br>
sensor element 25b are maintained at a predetermined<br>
temperature by a temperature controlling block 27.<br>
A fan 28 is disposed for discharging, to the outside<br>
of the apparatus, heat radiated from a Peltier element of<br>
the temperature controlling block 27.<br>
Further, the isotope gas spectroscopic measurement<br>
apparatus has a reference gas supply unit 30 for supplying<br>
the air with C02 removed. The reference gas supply unit 30<br>
is connected in series to a dust-proof filter 31 and a carbonic<br>
acid gas absorbing unit 36.<br>
The carbonic acid gas absorbing unit 36 is arranged<br>
to use for example soda lime (a mixture of sodium hydroxide<br>
and calcium hydroxide), as a carbonic acid gas absorbing<br>
agent.<br>
Fig. 2(a) is a plan view of a gas injection device<br>
21 for quantitatively inj ecting gas to be measured, and Fig.<br>
2(b) is a front view of the gas injection device 21.<br>
The gas injection device 21 has a base stand 21a, a<br>
cylinder 21b having a piston 21c disposed on the base stand<br>
21a, a movable nut 2Id coupled to the piston 21c, a feed<br>
screw 21e meshed with the nut 21d, and a pulse motor 21f<br>
for rotating the feed screw 21e, the nut 21d, the feed screw<br>
21e and the pulse motor 21f being disposed under the base<br>
stand 21a.<br>
The pulse motor 21f is driven forwardly/reversely by<br>
a driving circuit (not shown). When the feed screw 21e is<br>
rotated by the rotation of the pulse motor 21f, the nut 21d<br>
is moved back and forth according to the rotation direction.<br>
This causes the piston 21c to be moved back and forth to<br>
an optional position. It is therefore possible to optionally<br>
control both the introduction of gas to be measured, into<br>
the cylinder 21b, and the discharge of the gas to be measured<br>
from the cylinder 21b.<br>
III. Measuring Procedure<br>
The measuring process comprises the steps of determining<br>
a one-time gas injection amount, measuring the<br>
reference gas, measuring the base gas, measuring the<br>
reference gas, measuring the sample gas, and measuring the<br>
reference gas and the like. In Figs. 3 to 5, the arrows<br>
show the gas flowing.<br>
III-l. Determination of the One-Time Gas Injection Amount<br>
This gas injection amount determining step may be<br>
conducted at each measurement of a sample gas or at regular<br>
time intervals (e.g., every one hour).<br>
It is now supposed that the total of the first sample<br>
cell 11a volume and the second sample cell 11b volume is<br>
defined as Vc (a predetermined value). The volume Vc<br>
preferably not only includes the net volume of the sample<br>
cells lla, 11b, but also includes inner volumes of the pipes,<br>
valves and pressure sensor 16 which are connected through<br>
the sample cells lla, lib. It is also supposed that the<br>
volume of the gas injection device 21 at the time when gas<br>
is injectedby the gas injection device 21 to a predetermined<br>
scale thereof, is defined as Va. It is supposed that Vc<br>
+ Va = VO. This volume VO is defined as a standard volume<br>
vo.<br>
The valve V5 is opened, other valves are closed, and<br>
the air is sucked with the use of the gas injection device<br>
21. Then, the valve V5 is closed, and the valve V2 and the<br>
exhaust valve V6 are opened. The air in the gas injection<br>
device 21 is injected into the first sample cell lla and<br>
the second sample cell 11b. Then, the valve V2 is closed<br>
and the exhaust valve V6 is closed. Thus, the air having<br>
the volume Vc at the atmospheric pressure is housed in the<br>
first sample cell lla and the second sample cell 11b.<br>
As shown in Fig. 3 (a) , the valve V5 is opened, other<br>
valves are closed, and the air of volume Va is sucked with<br>
the use of the gas injection device 21.<br>
As shown in Fig. 3 (b) , the valve V5 is closed and the<br>
valve V2 is opened to transfer the air in the gas injection<br>
device 21 into the first sample cell lla and the second sample<br>
cell 11b. Since the exhaust valve V6 remains closed, the<br>
insides of the first sample cell lla and the second sample<br>
cell 11b are pressurized.<br>
With the valve V2 closed to stop the air movement,<br>
the pressure of the first sample cell 11a and the second<br>
sample cell 11b is measured by the pressure sensor 16. This<br>
measured pressure value is defined as P.<br>
It is supposed that each calibration curve for<br>
determining the relationship between absorbance and<br>
concentration of each of carbon dioxide 13C02 and carbon<br>
dioxide 12C02, has been prepared at a predetermined pressure<br>
P0(i.e., 4 atmospheric pressure). The calibration curve<br>
data and the value of the predetermined pressure PO are stored<br>
in an analysis computer of the isotope gas spectroscopic<br>
measurement apparatus.<br>
The analysis computer determines a one-time measuring<br>
gas volume VO(PO/P) with the use of the previously stored<br>
pressure PO, the measured pressure P and the standard volume<br>
VO. As shown by the following equation (1), the gas inj ect ion<br>
amount V of the gas injection device 21 is a value obtained<br>
by subtracting the cell volume Vc from VO(PO/P) . In the<br>
equation (1) , the volume Vc is subtracted because the first<br>
sample cell lla and the second sample cell lib already contain<br>
the gas to be measured having the volume Vc.<br>
V = VO(PO/P) - Vc (1)<br>
The following description will discuss the equation<br>
(1) . When the measured pressure P is equal to pO, the gas<br>
injection amount V is equal to Va. If the atmospheric<br>
pressure is high, the measured pressure P is higher than<br>
PO. At this time, the gas injection amount V may be set<br>
to a value smaller than Va. If the atmospheric pressure<br>
is low, the measured pressure P is lower than PO. At this<br>
time, the gas injection amount V may be set to a value higher<br>
than Va. With such an operation, the COz concentration can<br>
always be measured under conditions identical to those under<br>
which the calibration curve has been prepared.<br>
111-2. _Ref erence Measurement<br>
A clean reference gas is flowed into the gas flow<br>
passages and the cell chamber 11 of the isotope gas<br>
spectroscopic measurement apparatus to wash the gas flow<br>
passages and the cell chamber 11. At this time, the piston<br>
21c is moved back and forth to wash the inside of the cylinder<br>
2lb. A reference gas at an atmospheric pressure is housed<br>
in the first sample cell 11a and the second sample cell 11b.<br>
In the reference measurement, the valve V1 is opened,<br>
other valves are closed, and a reference gas is sucked with<br>
the use of the gas injection device 21, as shown in Fig.<br>
4(a) .<br>
Then, as shown in Fig. 4 (b), the valve VI is closed,<br>
and the valve V2 and the exhaust valve V6 are opened. While<br>
the reference gas in the gas injection device 21 is slowly<br>
flowed into the first sample cell lla and the second sample<br>
cell 11b by controlling the gas injection device 21, the<br>
light amount measurement is conducted by the sensor elements<br>
25a, 25b.<br>
The light amount thus obtained by the first sensor<br>
element 25a is recorded as 12R1, and the light amount thus<br>
obtained by the second sensor element 25b is recorded as<br>
13R1.<br>
III-3. Base Gas Measurement<br>
The valve V3 is opened, other valves are closed and<br>
the base gas is sucked with the use of the gas injection<br>
device .21. Then, the valve V3 is closed, the valve V2 and<br>
the exhaust valve V6 are opened, and the base gas in the<br>
gas injection device 21 is injected into the first sample<br>
cell 11a and the second sample cell 11b. Thereafter, the<br>
exhaust valve V6 is closed. Thus, the base gas at an<br>
atmospheric pressure is housed in the first sample cell lla<br>
and the second sample cell 11b.<br>
Then, the valve V3 is opened, other valves are closed<br>
and the base gas having the volume V calculated according<br>
to the equation (1) is sucked from the expired breath bag<br>
by the gas injection device 21, as shown in Fig. 5(a).<br>
After the base gas has been sucked, the valve V3 is<br>
closed, and the valve V2 is opened as shown in Fig. 5(b) .<br>
The base gas is mechanically pushed out with the use of the<br>
gas injection device 21 to pressurize the first sample cell<br>
lla and the second sample cell 11b. This increases the<br>
pressure of the base gas in the first sample cell lla and<br>
the second sample cell 11b, to a value equal to the pressure<br>
PO.<br>
At this state, the valve V2 is closed and the light<br>
amount is measured by the sensor elements 25a, 25b.<br>
The light amount thus obtained by the first sensor<br>
element 25a is recorded as 12B, and the light amount thus<br>
obtained by the second sensor element 25b is recorded as<br>
13B.<br>
III-4 Reference Measurement<br>
Again, the gas flow passages and the cells are washed/<br>
and the reference gas light amount measurement is conducted<br>
(See Figs. 4 (a), (b) ) . The light amount thus obtained by<br>
the first sensor element 25a is recorded as 12R2, and the<br>
light amount thus obtained by the second sensor element 25b<br>
is recorded as 13R2.<br>
III-5 Sample Gas Measurement<br>
The valve V4 is opened, other valves are-closed and<br>
the sample gas is sucked with the use of the gas injection<br>
device 21. Then, the valve V4 is closed, the valve V2 and<br>
the exhaust valve V6 are opened, and the sample gas in the<br>
gas injection device 21 is injected into the first sample<br>
cell lla and the second sample cell 11b. Thereafter, the<br>
exhaust valve V6 is closed. Thus, the sample gas at an<br>
atmospheric pressure is housed in the first sample cell lla<br>
and the second sample cell 11b.<br>
Then, the valve V4 is opened, other valves are closed<br>
and the sample gas having the volume V calculated according<br>
to the equation (1) is sucked from the expired breath bag<br>
by the gas injection device 21, as shown in Fig. 6(a).<br>
After the sample gas has been sucked, the valve V4<br>
is closed, and the valve V2 is opened, as shown in Fig. 6 (b) .<br>
The sample gas is mechanically pushed out with the use of<br>
the gas injection device 21 to pressurize the first sample<br>
cell lla and the second sample cell lib. This increases<br>
the pressure of the sample gas in the first sample cell lla<br>
and the secondsample cell lib, to a value equal to thepressure<br>
PO.<br>
At this state, the valve V2 is closed and the light<br>
amount is measured by the sensor elements 25a, 25b.<br>
The light amount thus obtained by the first sensor<br>
element 25a is recorded as 12S, and the light amount thus<br>
obtained by the second sensor element 25b is recorded as<br>
13S.<br>
III-6. Reference Measurement<br>
Again, the gas flow passages and the cells are washed,<br>
and the reference gas light amount measurement is conducted<br>
(See Figs. 4 (a), (b)) .<br>
The light amount thus obtained by the first sensor<br>
element 25a is recorded as 12R3, and the light amount thus<br>
obtained by the second sensor element 25b is recorded as<br>
13R3.<br>
IV Data Processing<br>
IV-1. Calculation of the Base Gas Absorbance Data<br>
First, both the absorbance 12Abs (B) of 12C02 and the<br>
absorbance 13Abs (B) of 13C02 in the base gas, are obtained<br>
with the use of (i) the transmitted light amounts 12R1, 13R1<br>
of the reference gas, (ii) the transmitted light amounts 12B,<br>
13B of the base gas, and (iii) the transmitted light amounts<br>
12R2, 13R2 of the reference gas.<br>
Here, the absorbance 12Abs (B) of 12C02 is obtained by<br>
the following equation:<br>
12Abs(B) = -log [212B/(12R1 + 12R2)]<br>
The absorbance 13Abs (B) of 13C02 is obtained by the<br>
following equation:<br>
13Abs(B) = -log [213B/(13R1 + 13R2)]<br>
Thus, when calculating each absorbance, there is<br>
calculated the average value (Rl + R2) 12 of the light amounts<br>
of reference measurements conducted before and after the<br>
absorbance calculation, and the absorbance is then calculated<br>
with the use of the average value thus obtained and<br>
the light amount obtained by the base gas measurement.<br>
Accordingly, the influence of drift (influence exerted to<br>
measurement by the passage of time) can be cancelled each<br>
other. Accordingly, the measurement can quickly be<br>
initiated without the need of waiting until the apparatus<br>
is brought into perfect thermal equilibrium after the<br>
apparatus has been stared (generally, several hours are<br>
required).<br>
IV-2. Calculation of Sample Gas Absorbance Data<br>
Then, both the absorbance uAbs(S) of 12C02 and the<br>
absorbance 13Abs(S) of 13C02 in the sample gas are obtained<br>
with the use of (i) the transmitted light amounts 12R2, 13R2<br>
of the reference gas, (ii) the transmitted light amounts 12S,<br>
13S of the sample gas, and (iii) the transmitted light amounts<br>
12R3, 13R3 of the reference gas.<br>
Here/ the absorbance 12Abs(S) of 12C02 is obtained by<br>
the following equation:<br>
12Abs(S) = -log [212S/(12R2 + 12R3}]<br>
The absorbance 13Abs (S) of 13C02 is obtained by the<br>
following equation:<br>
13Abs(S) = -log [213S/(13R2 + 13R3)]<br>
Thus, when calculating an absorbance, there is<br>
calculated the average value of the light amounts of reference<br>
measurements conducted before and after the absorbance<br>
calculation, and the absorbance is then calculated with the<br>
use of the average value thus obtained and the light amount<br>
obtained by the sample gas measurement. Accordingly, the<br>
influence of drift can be cancelled each other.<br>
IV-3 Concentration Calculation<br>
12C02 concentration and 13C02 concentration are obtained<br>
with the use of calibration curves.<br>
As mentioned earlier, the concentration curves are<br>
prepared with the use of gas to be measured of which 12C02<br>
concentration is known and gas to be measured of which 13C02<br>
concentration is known.<br>
To obtain the calibration curve for 12C02 concentration,<br>
12CO: absorbance data are measured with the 12C02 concentration<br>
changed in the range of 0% to about 8%, and the data thus<br>
measured are plotted on a graph in which the axis of abscissas<br>
represents the 12C02 concentration and the axis of ordinates<br>
represents the i2CO? absorbance. Then, the curve is determined<br>
by the method of least squares.<br>
To obtain the calibration curve for 13CC&gt;2 concentration,<br>
13CO2 absorbance data are measuredwith the I3COa concentration<br>
changed in the range of 0% to about 0.08%, and the data thus<br>
measured are plotted on a graph in which the axis of abscissas<br>
represents the 13C02 concentration and the axis of ordinates<br>
represents the 13COa absorbance. Then, the curve is determined<br>
by the method of least squares.<br>
The curves approximated by quadratic equations are<br>
relatively less in error. Accordingly, the calibration<br>
curves approximated by quadratic equations are adopted in<br>
this embodiment.<br>
There are recorded the 12C02 concentration of the base<br>
gas as 12Conc(B) , the 13C02 concentration of the base gas as<br>
13Conc(B), the 12C02 concentration of the sample gas as<br>
i:Conc(S) , and the 13C02 concentration of the sample gas as<br>
13Conc (S) , these concentration data being obtained with the<br>
use of the calibration curves above-mentioned.<br>
IV-4 Calculation of the Concentration Ratios<br>
Then, each concentration ratio between 13C02 and 12C02<br>
is obtained. That is, the concentration ratio between 13CC&gt;2<br>
and 12C02 of the base gas is obtained by 13Conc (B) / 12Conc (B) ,<br>
and the concentration ratio between 13C02 and 12COz of the<br>
sample gas is obtained by 13Conc(S)/ 12Conc(S).<br>
The concentration ratios may also be defined as<br>
13Conc(B)/(12Conc(B) +13Conc(B)) and as 13Conc (S) / (12Conc (S)<br>
+ 13Conc (S) ) . Since the 12CC&gt;2 concentrations are much greater<br>
than the 13C02 concentrations, the concentration ratios<br>
obtained by these different calculation methods are<br>
substantially equal to each other.<br>
IV-5 Determination of 13C Changed Portion<br>
The 13C changed portion in comparison of the sample<br>
gas data with the base gas data, is calculated by the following<br>
equation:<br>
A13C = [Sample Gas Concentration Ratio - Base Gas<br>
Concentration Ratio] x 103/[Base Gas Concentration Ratio]<br>
(Unit: permil).<br><br><br><br><br><br>
We Claim:<br>
1. An isotope gas analyzing and measuring apparatus in which a gas to be measured containing, as gas components, carbon dioxide 13CO2 and carbon dioxide 12CO2, is introduced into a cell, and the intensities of transmitted lights having wavelengths suitable for measurement of the respective gas components, are measured and data-processed to measure the concentration of the carbon dioxide 13CO2, the isotope gas analyzing and measuring apparatus comprising:<br>
