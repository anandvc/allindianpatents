				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION     <br>
[4]        The invention relates to method of producing a wrinkle resistant washing substent fabric. <br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[5] Although cotton fabric possesses advantages of good elasticity, good moisture absorbability, breathability and comfort, they wrinkle easily during wearing and after laundering due to the breakage and deformation of the hydrogen bonds in the non-crystalline regions of the cellulose fibers by external forces or by the action of moisture, under which hydrogen bonds are once again formed. Especially after repeated laundering, there is a fuzzy appearance and a general fading of the clothes.<br>
[6] There have been many attempts to improve the quality of cotton fabrics. For example, prior art method involves the modification of the surface of cotton fabrics with either polymeric resins to resist wrinkling, or alternately with enzymes to obtain washing-resistance. However, there are no methods in the prior art that teach the use of a resin treatment agent in combination with an enzymatic treatment to improve the quality of cotton fabrics<br>
[7] Ironing-free treatment includes selecting a suitable polymeric resin, applying the polymeric resin to the clothes, followed by drying and baking, to make the polymeric resin form stable chemical cross-linking between chains of the cellulose macrornolecules and thereby improve the properties of deformation resistance and<br>
deformation restoration. Consequently, elasticity is increased and wrinkling is reduced<br>
[8j	One purpose of an enzyme treatment is to improve the quality of the<br>
finished goods by dehairing and smoothing. The enzymes commonly used for improving washing-resistance are hydrolases, such as cellulases and pectases, which hydrolyze exposed beta-1,4 bonds in cellulose and decompose the cellulose molecules to low molecular hydrolysates, such as cellobiose and glucose. This leads to removal of the fibrils, which are the most exposed part of the fabric The removal of fibrils is believed to directly improve the softness of the garments and also to lead to better color and cleanliness, both by removing soil attached to the fibrils and by improving the penetration of other cleaning compounds being used The removal of fibrils initially also helps to prevent a subsequent formation of fibrils At the same time, results in strength loss of the cotton fabric to make fuzz and loose surface fibers, which re-occurred after wearing and washing, easily broken and removed. After repeated experiments, washing-resistance is improved by a single enzymatic treatment. However, after the enzymatic-treated fabric has been washed several times, the appearance of the washed fabric merits a rating of 2.0 to 3.0 on the ASTM scale, but cannot reach the desired rating of 4.0 according to ASTM testing method. When the cotton fabric is subjected to the enzymatic treatment several times, it results in weight loss of the cotton, serious strength loss of fabric and less improvement on washing-resistance. Besides, not only does this result in increased costs, the operations are also complicated due to the demanding requirements of the enzymatic treatment<br>
[9]	Traditional  washing-resistant  treatments   for  cotton   fabrics   include<br>
methods for polymeric resin treatment of cotton fabrics comprising the steps of, knitting, scouring, dyeing, soaping, fixing, softening, dehydrating, drying, heat-setting, making garments, applying a polymeric resin finish to the garments, tumble drying and testing. The traditional washing-resistant treatment includes methods for enzymatic treatment of cotton fabrics comprising the steps of knitting, scouring, dyeing, soaping, fixing, softening, dehydrating, drying, heat-setting, making garments, treating the garments with-enzymes, tumble drying and testing.<br>
[10J      Numerous tests have proved that either one of the above two methods, when used separately, are unable to achieve the good properties of both wrinkle-<br>
resistance and washing-resistance. Tn addition, as the two methods are operated on ready-to-be-worn clothes, the operation is complicated, less efficient and expensive<br>
[11] Therefore there is a need to improve the existing methods in the art, which currently employ either a polymeric resin treatment agent or an enzymatic treatment.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>

[16) In the following description, all numbers disclosed herein are approximate values, regardless whether the word "about" or "approximate" is used in connection therewith. They may vary by 1 percent, 2 percent, 5 percent, or, sometimes, 10 to 20 percent Whenever a numerical range with a lower limit, RL and an upper limit, R , is disclosed, any number falling within the range is specifically disclosed. In particular, the following numbers within the range are specifically disclosed: R=RL+k*(Ru-RL), wherein k is a variable ranging from 1 percent to 100 percent with a 1 percent increment, i.e., k is 1 percent, 2 percent, 3 percent, 4 percent, 5 percent,..., 50 percent, 51 percent, 52 percent,..., 95 percent, 96 percent, 97 percent, 98 percent, 99 percent, or 100 percent Moreover, any numerical range defined by two R numbers as defined in the above is also specifically disclosed<br>
[17J It has now been discovered that wrinkle-free and washing-resistant cotton fabrics can be produced by a method that combines a polymeric resin treatment with an enzymatic treatment. Such a method changes the traditional treatments in order to realize the low costs and improve the properties of wrinkle-resistance and washing-resistance of fabrics, with high efficiency. It is a synergistic combination of the polymeric resin agent treatment and enzymatic treatment, rather than a simple combination of the two methods that produces unexpected improvements.<br>
[18] Accordingly, embodiments of the invention provide a method for manufacturing woven or knit fabrics having improved shrink and crease resistance and good shape memory following repeated washes The method comprises (a) contacting a cellulosic material (e.g., cotton fabric) with an enzyme composition, wherein the enzyme composition comprises an enzyme; and (b) treating the cellulosic material with a polymeric resin composition. In an embodiment of the invention, the cellulosic material or fabric is sequentially treated with an enzyme composition followed by treatment with a resin treatment agent.<br>
[19] As used herein, the term "fabric" refers to a cloth or textile made by weaving, knitting, or felting cellulose-based fibers. As used herein, the term "enzyme composition" is a composition that comprises an enzyme. Enzymes are a group of proteins which catalyze a variety of typically biochemical reactions. Enzyme preparations have been obtained from natural sources and have been adapted for a<br>
variety of chemical applications. Enzymes are typically classified based on the substrate target of the enzymatic action. The enzymes useful in the compositions of this invention involve hydrolases and oxidoreductases. Hydrolases are enzymes that attack complex molecules, accelerating their digestion and yielding simpler substances. Since this process of digestion is referred to as hydrolysis, the enzymes that catalyze the process are considered to be "hydrolyzing enzymes" or "hydrolases"<br>
[201 The "hydrolase" group of enzymes comprises: (1) Amylases, which catalyze the digestion of starch into small segments of multiple sugars and into individual soluble sugars; (2) Proteases, (or proteinase), which split up proteins into their component amino acid building blocks; (3) Lipases, which split up animal and vegetable fats and oils into their component part: glycerol and fatty acids, (4) Cellulase (of various types) which breaks down the complex molecule of cellulose into smaller components of single and multiple sugars; (5) Beta-glucanase, (or gumase) which digest one type of vegetable gum into sugars and/or dextnns; and (6) Pectmase, which digests pectin and similar carbohydrates of plant origin.<br>
[21] Oxidoreductases are enzymes that catalyze electron transfer in oxidation-reduction reactions. Oxidoreductases are classified into several groups according to their respective donors or acceptors. Examples of oxidoreductases include, but are not limited to, oxidoreductases that act on the CH-OH group of donors; oxidoreductases that act on the aldehyde or oxo group of donors; oxidoreductases that act on the CH-CH group of donors, oxidoreductases that act on the CH-NH2 group of donors; oxidoreductases that act on the CH-NH group of donors; oxidoreductases that act on NADH or NADPH; oxidoreductases that act on other nitrogenous compounds as donors; oxidoreductases that act on a sulfur group of donors; oxidoreductases that act on heme group of donors; oxidoreductases that act on diphenols and related substances as donors, oxidoreductases that act on a peroxide as acceptor, oxidoreductases that act on hydrogen as donor, oxidoreductases that act on single donors with incorporation of molecular oxygen (oxygenases), oxidoreductases that act on paired donors with incorporation of molecular oxygen, oxidoreductases that act on superoxide radicals as acceptor; oxidoreductases that oxidize metal ions;    oxidoreductases that act on -CH2- groups;    oxidoreductases thatact on reduced ferredoxin as donor; oxidoreductases that act on reduced flavodoxin as donor, and, other oxidoreductases An example of a suitable oxidoreductase which may be used m an embodiment of the invention is laccase. Under the reactions employed in embodiments of the invention, laccase displays great robustness with minimum strength loss.<br>
[22] An embodiment of the invention employs an enzyme composition comprising one or more hydrolases. In another embodiment of the invention, the enzyme composition comprises only one hydrolase. In certain embodiments of the invention the enzyme compositions comprise cellulose hydrolases (cellulases). In other embodiments of the invention, the enzyme composition comprises pectases (pectinesterases). Certain embodiments of the invention employ an enzyme composition comprising a combination of cellulase and pectase. Certain embodiments of the invention employ a combination of a hydrolase and an oxidoreductase.<br>
[23J Cellulases are typically produced from bacterial and fungal sources which use cellulase in the degradation of cellulose to obtain an energy source or to obtain a source of structure during their life cycle. Examples of bacteria and fungi which produce cellulase are as follows: Bacillus hydrolyticus, Cellulobacillus mucosus, cellulobacillus myxogenes, Cellulomonas sp., Cell vibrio fulvus, Cellu vibrio vulgaris, Clostridium thermocellulaseum, Clostridium thermocellum, Corynebacterium sp., Cytophaga globulosa, Pseudomonas fluoroescens var. cellulosa, Pseudomonas solanacearum, Bactericides succinogenes, Ruminococcus albus, Ruminococcus flavefaciens, Sorandium composition, Butynvibrio, Clostridium sp , Xanthomonas cyamopsidis, Sclerotium bataticola, Bacillus sp., Thermoactmomyces sp., Actinobifida sp., Actinomycetes sp , Streptomyces sp., Arthrobotrys superba, Aspergillus aureus, Aspergillus flavipes, Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus fumigatus, Aspergillus fuchuems, Aspergillus nidulans, Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus oryzae, Aspergillus rugulosus, Aspergillus sojae, Aspergillus sydwi, Aspergillus tarnanl, Aspergillus terreus, Aspergillus unguis, Aspergillus ustus, Takamine-Cellulase, Aspergillus saitoi, Botrytis cinerea, Botryodipiodia theobromae, Cladosponum cucummerinum,  Cladosponum herbarum,  Coccospora agricola,  Curvuiana lunata,<br>

[24] Cellulase, like many enzyme preparations, is typically produced in an impure state and often is manufactured on a support. The solid cellulase particulate product is provided with information indicating the number of international enzyme units present per each gram of material. The activity of the solid matenal is used to formulate the treatment compositions of this invention Typically the commercial preparations contain from about 1,000 to 6,000 CMC (carboxymethyl cellulose) enzyme units per gram of product.<br>
[25] Pectin polymers are important constituents of plant cell walls. Pectin is a hetero-polysaccharide with a backbone composed of alternating homogalacturonan (smooth regions) and rhamnogalacturonan (hairy regions). The smooth regions are linear polymers of 1,4-hnked alpha-D-galactaromc acid The galacturonic acid residues can be methyl-esterified on thecarboxyl group to a varying degree, usually in a non-random fashion with blocks of polygalacturonic acid being completely methyl-esterified.<br>
[26J Pectinases can be classified according to their preferential substrate, highly methyl-estenfied pectin or low methyl-esterified pectm and polygalacturonic acid (pectate), and their reaction mechanism, beta-elimination or hydrolysis. Pectinases can be mainly endo-acting, cutting the polymer at random sites within the chain to give a mixture of oligomers, or they may be exo-acting, attacking from one end of the polymer and producing monomers or dimers. Several pectinase activities acting on the smooth regions of pectin are included in the classification of enzymes provided by the Enzyme Nomenclature (1992) such as pectate lyase (EC 4.2.2.2), pectin lyase (EC 4.2.2.10), polygalacturonase (EC 3.2.1.15), exo-polygalacturonase (EC 3.2.1.67), exG-polygalacturonate lyase (EC 4.2.2.9) and exo-poly-alpha-galacturonosidase (EC 3.2.1.82).<br>
[27] Pectate lyases have been cloned from different bacterial genera such as Erwinia, Pseudomonas, Klebsiella and Xanthomonas. Also from Bacillus subtihs (Nasser et al. (1993) FEBS 335:319-326) and Bacillus sp. YA-14 (Kim et al. (1994) Biosci. Biotech. Biochem. 58:947-949) cloning of a pectate lyase has been described. Purification of pectate lyases with maximum activity in the pH range of 8-10 produced by Bacillus pumilus (Dave and Vaughn (1971) J. Bacteriol. 108:166-174), B. polymyxa (Nagel and Vaughn (1961) Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 93:344-352), B. stearothermophilus (Karbassi and Vaughn (1980) Can. J. Microbiol. 26:377-384), Bacillus sp. (Hasegawa and Nagel (1966) J. Food Sci. 31.838-845) and Bacillus sp. RK9 (Kelly and Fogarty (1978) Can. J. Microbiol. 24.1164-1172) has been reported, however, no publication was found on cloning of pectate lyase encoding genes from these organisms. All the pectate lyases described require divalent cations for maximum activity, calcium ions being the most stimulatory<br>
[28J Any pectmesterase from plants, bacteria or fungi, suitable for the degradation of pectin can be used in embodiments of the invention. Preferably, the pectmesterase is from fungal origin. More preferably, the pectmesterase is to obtained from Aspergilh, especially preferred is the use of pectmesterase obtained from Aspergillus niger.<br>
[29] In a preferred embodiment purified pectinesterase is used. This purification can be performed in different ways.<br>
(30J The crude enzyme may be purified for example by liquid chromatography (ion exchange, gel filtration, affinity) or by selective inhibition of the pectin depolymerases (pH shock, heat shock, chemical inhibitors, chemical or organic solvents extraction; see U.S. Patent No 2,599,531, which is fully incorporated by reference herein). Another source for obtaining purified pectmesterase as defined for the present application is pectinesterase obtained by recombinant DNA technology An example of the use of recombinant DNA technology is the expression cloning of the Aspergillus niger pectinesterase. As expression host Aspergillus mger could be used. However, in view of the possible contamination of the pectinesterase with polygalacturonase, pectin lyase and other pectin depolymerases it may be preferable to use a heterologous host organism for producing the pectinesterase. Suitable host organisms include bacteria and fungi. Preferred species are Bacilli, Eschenchia, Saccharomyces, Kluyveromyces and Aspergilh.<br>
[31] As used herein, the term "resin treatment agent" refers to a composition comprising a polymeric resin. In certain embodiments of the invention the resin treatment agent comprises two or more polymeric resins. In other embodiments of the invention, the resin treatment agent further comprises one or more of a catalyst, a strength protecting agent, a softener, and a penetrating reagent.<br>
(32] In certain embodiments, resin treatment agents comprise a crosslinking agent that is used to treat the fibers of fabrics. Early processes used formaldehyde as a crosslmking agent which, although effective, was highly odorous and undesirable to the consumer.

[39] Some embodiments of the invention provide a method of producing a wrinkle-resistant, washing-resistant cellulosic fabric comprising, contacting the fabric with an enzyme composition; and treating the fabric with a resin treatment agent subsequent to the contacting step. In certain embodiments of the invention, the cellulosic fabric comprises cotton fibers<br>
[40] Optional steps in which the cotton fabric is enzyme-scoured, washed, dyed, dehydrated, dried, finished with a finishing agent other than a resin treatment agent, and/or heat-set are used in some embodiments. Other embodiments incorporate a further optional step of garment making.<br>
[41] The enzyme scouring step removes oil, wax and other impurities from the cotton fabric and thus provides the fabric with a better wetting property during the dyeing process.<br>
[42J In the dyeing step, the fabric is treated with a natural or synthetic dye to achieve the desired coloration<br>
[43] The finishing step comprises the treatment of the fabric with a "finishing agent" which imparts certain useful properties to the fabric including but not limited to, shrink resistance and a uniform soft feel. In certain embodiments of the invention the finishing agent used in the finishing step is a phosphorous amide compound<br>
[44] Following treatment with the finishing agent, the fabric is typically subjected to a heat treatment or heat-set. The heat treatment may be carried out using any heat sources such as hot air, infrared rays, microwave and steam Heat treating temperature is preferably 50Â° C to 180Â° C, and heat treating time is preferably 1 to 30 minutes.<br>
[45] In certain embodiments of the invention, the enzyme composition is contacted with said fabric at an acidic pH range between about 3 to about 7 In an embodiment of the invention the acidic pH range is achieved by contacting the enzyme composition with the fabric in the presence of an acid. Examples of acids include but are not limited to hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, nitric acid and acetic acid<br>
{46} The enzymatic treatment solution used to contact the fabnc is most often an aqueous solution of a mixture of the enzymes and acetic acids. The amounts of said enzymes is from about 0.1 to about 2.5 g/1 and the amounts of said acetic acid is from about 0 4 to about 0.8 g/1, which are adjustable according to needs in practice and the different parts of the knitwear. The bath ratio of the fabric to the mixture can fall within the range of about 1:8 to about 40. Reaction temperatures useful for enzyme compositions are governed by two competing factors. Firstly, higher temperatures generally correspond to enhanced reaction kinetics, I e , faster reactions, which permit reduced reaction times as compared to reaction times required at lower temperatures For cellulase and pectases, reaction temperatures are generally at least about 35Â°C or greater. Secondly, these enzymes lose activity beyond a given reaction temperature which temperature is dependent on the nature of the enzyme used. Thus, if the reaction temperature is permitted to go too high, then the desired enzymatic activity is lost as a result of the denaturing of the enzyme. Cellulase and pectases, as exemplified herein, are preferably used at temperatures of from about 35Â°C to about 60Â°C. In most cases, it is desirable to obtain effective treatment within a time frame of from about 10 to about 80 minutes.<br>
[47] The amounts of the reagents used in the polymeric resin treatment step are. polymeric resins of from 20 to 240 g/1, catalysts of from 5 to 30 g/i, strength protecting agents of from 10 to 50 g/1, softeners of from 10 to 100 g/I, and penetrating reagents of from 0.5 to 2.5 g/1, all of which are adjustable according to needs in practice and the different parts of the fabric.<br>
[48] The optional garment making step comprises the following steps: (1) an interlining is used and selected from non-woven thermal adhesive interlinings; the shrinkage of said interlining should be consistent with that of the fabric panel to avoid shrinkage of clothes after washing; (2) collar and sleeve should be properly tight or loose to compensate for the difference in shrinkage between them and other parts of the fabric when they are sewn; and (3) the stitches should not be too close to compensate different shrinkage between the threads and the fabric panel, and, (4) the threads cannot shrink too much.<br>
[49]      Embodiments of the invention have one or more of the following<br>
advantages compared to traditional methods known in the art The method, which combines the enzymatic treatment with the polymeric resin treatment, is used in embodiments of the invention for treating cotton fabric to impart an improved retention/restoration property than those imparted by prior art methods Even after 20 separate instances of normal home laundering, the appearance i.e., the extent of pilling and the level of color remains the same as that before washing, with a rating of greater than 3.0 (or greater than 4 in some embodiments) according to both ASTM (American Society for Testing and Materials) and AATCC (American Association of Textile Chemists and Colorists) testing methods, without loose fibrils and protrusions that usually occurred in non-treated fabnc, and in addition, there is less fading of clothes and improved shrinking-resistance.<br>
[50} The pilling resistance is graded using ASTM D3512 photographic standards and color change is graded using AATCC Evaluation Procedure 1 Gray Scale for Color Change.<br>
[511 The ASTM D3512 test method, which is fully incorporated by reference herein, is a standard test method for determining pilling resistance and other related surface changes of textile fabrics. This test method covers the resistance to the formation of pills and other related surface changes on textile fabrics using the random tumble pilling tester. The procedure is generally applicable to all types of woven and knitted apparel fabrics. Pilling and other changes in surface appearance, such as fuzzing, that occur in normal wear are simulated on a laboratory testing machine Pills are caused to form on fabric by a random rubbing action produced by tumbling specimens in a cylindrical test chamber lined with a mildly abrasive material. To form pills with appearance and structure that resemble those produced in actual wear, small amounts of short-length gray cotton fiber are added to each test chamber with the specimens. The degree of fabric pilling is evaluated by comparison of the tested specimens with visual standards that may be actual fabrics, or photographs of fabrics, showing a range of pilling resistance. The observed resistance to pilling is reported using an arbitrary rating scale ranging from 5 (no pilling) to 1 (very severe pilhng).<br>
[52]      As used herein the term "fuzz" refers to untangled fiber ends that<br>
protrude from the surface of a yarn or fabric. The term "pilling resistance" refers to resistance to the formation of pilis on the surface of a textile fabric The term "pills" refers to the bunches or balls of tangled fibers which are held to the surface of a fabric by one or more fibers.<br>
[53J In certain embodiments of the invention, the ASTM and AATCC grades are at least 3.5. In other embodiments of the invention, the ASTM and AATCC grades are greater than 3.7. 4.0, 4.2, 4.5, 4 7, or 4.9.<br>
[54]      The AATCC Evaluation Procedure  1 Gray Scale for Color Change, which is fully incorporated by reference herein, describes the use of a Gray Scale for evaluating changes in color of textiles resulting from colorfastness tests. The results of a colorfastness test is rated by visually comparing the difference in color or the contrast between the untreated and treated specimens with the differences represented a scale.    The colorfastness grade is equal to the gray scale step which is judged to have the same color or contrast difference.    As used herein the term "color change" refers to a change in color of any kind whether in lightness, hue or chroma, or any combination   of   these,   discernible   by   comparing   the   test   specimen   with   a corresponding untreated specimen.    The term "colorfastness" refers to the resistance of a material to change in any of its color characteristics, to transfer of its coiorant(s) to adjacent materials or both, as a result of the exposure of the material to any environment that might be encountered during the processing, testing, storing, or use of the material.    The "Gray Scale" is a scale consisting of pairs of standard gray chips, the pairs representing progressive differences in color or contrast corresponding to numerical colorfastness grades.    Colorfastness grade 5 is represented on the scale by two reference chips mounted side by side, neutral gray in color and having a  Y tnstimulus   value   of   12+1.      The   color   difference   of  the   pair   is   0.0   +   0 2. Colorfastness grades 4.5 to 1, inclusive, are represented by reference chips like those used in Step 5 paired with lighter neutral gray chips of similar dimensions and gloss. The visual differences in the whole step pairsâcolorfastness grades 4, 3, 2 and l~are in geometric steps of color difference, or contrast as shown in the Table below.    The differences  in the half-step colorfastness  grade  pairsâ4-5,  3-4,  2-3  and   1-2âare intermediate between the whole step pairs<br>
