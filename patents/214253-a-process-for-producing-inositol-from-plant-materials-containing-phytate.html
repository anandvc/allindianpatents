				<td>A PROCESS FOR PRODUCING INOSITOL FROM PLANT MATERIALS<br>
CONTAINING PHYTATE<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
This invention relates to a process for producing inositol from plant materials<br>
containing phytate.<br>
Background to the Invention<br>
Inositol is a highly valued B-vitamin. Plants contain phytic acid {myoinositol<br>
1,2,3.4,5,6-hexakis (dihydrogen phosphoric acid)} as the storage form of<br>
phosphorus. Phytic acid is found within plant cell structures as mineral<br>
bound complexes termed phytin. Phytin is largely insoluble at neutral pH.<br>
Phytic acid can also exit in solution in the salt form termed phytate. The<br>
terms "phytin" and phytate are often used interchangeably. The term<br>
"phytate" used throughout the description and claims, is intended to<br>
referito phytic acid, phytate and phytin, except where a distinction<br>
between these materials is made specifically.<br>
Some of the partial hydrolysis products of phytate are inositol<br>
pentaphosphate (IP5), inositol tetraphosphate (1P4), inositol<br>
triphosphate (1P3), inositol diphosphate (1P2) and inositol<br>
monophosphate (1P1). These partial hydrolysis products of<br>
phytate can be hydrolyzed further to yield inositol. The obtaining<br>
of inositol from a plant material requires conversion of the phytate<br>
to inositol and purification of the inositol from other components in<br>
the plant starting material.<br>
Producing inositol from plant material is difficult. One approach is<br>
to hyarolyze the phytate in an aqueous slurry, to yield various<br>
sugars including inositol. However, inositol is a neutral soluble<br>
suga, that is very similar in molecular size and charge<br>
characteristics to other sugars such as glucose that are often<br>
present in high levels in plant materials. Because of this, it can be<br>
difficult to separate the inositol from the other carbohydrates in<br>
the slurry.<br>
Another approach to production of inositol from plant materials is<br>
to purify the phytate from the starting slurry and to hydrolyze the<br>
purified phytate to inositol in a later step in the overall process.<br>
However, because phytate in plants usually exists in the form of<br>
phytin, direct phytate purification from an aqueous slurry of plant<br>
materials requires solubilization of phytin and then separation of<br>
the phytate from the remainder of the components of the slurry.<br>
Efficient extraction, solubilization of phytin and separation from<br>
the remaining components of the slurry is difficult.<br>
Description of the Invention<br>
This invention describes a useful and novel process for<br>
overcoming the inherent difficulties in obtaining inositol from plant<br>
materials.<br>
In accordance with the inventive process, phytate in an aqueous<br>
slurry of plant material is partially hydrolyzed by incubating the<br>
slurry with an enzyme product enriched in phytase. The soluble<br>
fraction of the slurry is separated into anionic and neutral<br>
fractions. The anionic fraction is then hydrolyzed further, and is in<br>
turn separated into ionic and neutral fractions.<br>
The neutral fraction thus obtained is rich in inositol, and does not<br>
contain significant quantities of other sugars which would be hard<br>
to separate from it.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a process for producing inositol from<br>
plant materials containing phytate, said process comprising the steps of:<br>
(a) treating an aqueous slurry of the plant material with a phytase enzyme to<br>
hydrolyze at least one of phytate, phytic acid and phytin contained in the plant<br>
material, to inositol phosphates, said hydrolysis being carried out under such<br>
conditions, such as herein described, which do not promote full hydrolysis to<br>
yield inositol;<br>
(b) separating said slurry into a water soluble fraction and a water-insoluble<br>
fraction;<br>
(c) separating said water soluble fraction into a first ionic fraction which contains<br>
anionic components comprising inositol phosphates and a first other fraction<br>
which contains the neutral components;<br>
(d) hydrolysing the inositol phosphates in said first ionic fraction; and<br>
(e) separating the hydrolyzed first ionic fraction into a second ionic fraction and a<br>
second neutral fraction which contains inositol, followed by separation of<br>
inositol from said second neutral fraction.<br>
Description of the Accompanying Drawings<br>
Figure 1 is a process flow chart depicting processing stages in<br>
accordance with the invention.<br>
Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
According to the invention, an aqueous slurry of plant material is<br>
partially hydrolyzed using phytase enzyme. Figure 1 shows a<br>
process flow chart of the various steps in the process of the<br>
invention.<br>
As shown in Figure 1, an aqueous slurry of plant material A is<br>
subjected to partial hydrolysis with phytase. This is preferably<br>
done by incubating the aqueous slurry with phytase, at suitable<br>
temperature and pH to encourage partial hydrolysis.<br>
The phytase enzyme can hydrolyze phytate to inosrtol j<br>
pentaphosphate (IP5), inositol tetraphosphate (IP4), inositol<br>
triphosphate (IP3) and inositol diphosphate (IP2). However, the<br>
phytase has little activity for hydrolysis of inositol 2-<br>
monophosphate inositol (IP1). Acid phosphatase can readily<br>
hydrolyze IP1 to free inositol, which is not desired at this point in<br>
the inventive process. Thus, the source of phytase used<br>
preferably contains little or no acid phosphatase. A source of<br>
phytase containing acid phosphatase activity can also be used, if<br>
reaction conditions are chosen to favour phytase activity and<br>
avoid substantial hydrolysis of IP1 by acid phosphatase. In using<br>
a source of phytase containing acid phosphatase the preferred<br>
pH of the reaction is greater than 3.0 and less than 7 for optimum<br>
phytase activity without substantial hydrolysis of IP1 to inositol.<br>
IP5, IP4, IP3, IP4, IP2 and IP1 are the major products of the<br>
reaction. They are highly soluble negatively charged compounds<br>
that exist in solution in the partially hydrolyzed slurry (shown as<br>
"B" in Figure 1). The partially hydrolyzed slurry is separated by<br>
physical separation means, such as filtration or centrifugation, to<br>
generate an inositol phosphate-containing soluble fraction (a<br>
"total soluble" fraction called C in Figure 1,) and an insoluble<br>
fraction (called "D" in Figure 1 ).<br>
Unlike inositol, inositol phosphates have a negative charge. It is<br>
therefore possible to separate the total soluble fraction into an<br>
anionic fraction and a first neutral fraction, with the inositol<br>
phosphates passing into the anionic fraction. Depending on how<br>
the separation is carried out, any cationic soluble materials<br>
present may remain either with the anionic fraction or the first<br>
neutral fraction.<br>
Total soluble fraction C is therefore separated into a first ionic<br>
fraction enriched in anionic constituents - called "ionic fraction 1"<br>
or "E" in Figure"!) and a first fraction enriched in neutral<br>
constituents (and possibly cationic constituents as well, called "F"<br>
in Figure 1). Ionic fraction 1 (E) contains most of the inositol<br>
phosphates, and the neutral fraction contains most of the neutral<br>
soluble constituents of the total soluble fraction. The separation is<br>
done using known techniques for the separation of charged ionic<br>
species from soluble neutral compounds in a solution. Such<br>
techniques are, for example, ion exchange, ion exclusion, or ion<br>
retardation column separations. If it is desired to retain the<br>
cationic components in the neutral fraction, a cationic ion<br>
exchange resin can be used, which will separate out only the<br>
anionic components into the first ionic fraction. If it is desired that<br>
the cationic components are separated out as well, then mixed<br>
anionic and cationic exchange resins can be used. The important<br>
thing at this stage is to end with one fraction which contains the<br>
anionic components and a second which contains the neutral<br>
components. Cationic components are not of concern in the<br>
process of the invention, so they can remain in either fraction.<br>
The next step in the process is to complete the hydrolysis of<br>
inositol phosphates in the ionic fraction. This process can be done<br>
with enzymes such as phytase or acid phosphatase or without<br>
enzyme-based catalysis under controlled conditions of<br>
temperature, pressure and pH. Suitable conditions for inositol<br>
phosphate hydrolysis are known, and can be chosen according to<br>
the particular reaction equipment available. The preferred<br>
approach is to use an enzyme source containing acid<br>
phosphatase at a pH of less than 4 for optimum activity.<br>
Complete hydrolysis of inositol phosphates will generate an<br>
anionic fraction (G in Figure 1) which contains various anionic<br>
compounds from fraction E as well as neutral inositol.<br>
Inositol can be separated from the remainder of the soluble<br>
compounds in the anionic fraction G using known techniques for<br>
separating charged from neutral compounds in solution, such as,<br>
for example, an ion exchange, ion exclusion or ion retardation<br>
column. This process generates a second ionic fraction (-called<br>
herein ionic fraction 2, and indicated in Figure 1 as "H"). and a<br>
second neutral I fraction (T in Figure1) rich in inositol. The<br>
inositol in the second neutral fraction can then be concentrated,<br>
crystallized and dried to form a final dry purified inositol product.<br>
The invention has (seen described by reference to preferred<br>
embodiments, but it will be understood that other embodiments<br>
will be evident to a person skilled in the art. It is therefore desired<br>
that the invention shall not be limited by the particular<br>
embodiments shown, but shall include such other embodiments<br>
as would occur to a skilled person.<br>
