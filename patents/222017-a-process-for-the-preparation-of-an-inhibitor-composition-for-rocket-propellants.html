				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a process for the preparation of an inhibitor composition for rocket propellants, wherein the composition incorporates a reactive dual purpose additive which is flame retardant as well as adhesive, and has improved mechanical properties.<br>
PRIOR ART<br>
Inhibition of rocket propellants is required to control the burning patterns. For this purpose, the inhibitor material is required to be made non-combustible and to be possessing good adhesion to various surfaces like that of the propellant or insulator on the rocket motor. In big motors a liner material is applied between the insulator of the rocket motor and the inhibitor, for better bonding between the two. To achieve flame retardancy and adhesion, flame retardants and adhesives are added as disparate additive in the inhibitor/liner mix before curing it into an elastomeric matrix.<br>
The inhibitor formulations known in the art use solid additives like Sb2O3 , asbestos or tricresyl phosphate (flame retardant).<br>
The disadvantage of inhibitor formulations using above solid additives is that they are heterogeneous with the binder material of the inhibitor/liner as they are insoluble and unreactive solids.<br><br>
Another disadvantage of the inhibitor formulation based<br>
on above additives is that these formulations have poor bonding<br>
leading to debonding at interfaces.<br>
Yet another disadvantage of inhibitor formulations<br>
ufcing above solid additives is that in these formulations, after<br>
ageing, boundary separation and settling of solids take place<br>
making the formulation as non-uniform.<br>
Still another disadvantage of inhibitor formulations<br>
using above solid additives is that they have poor mechanical<br>
praparti es.<br>
Further advantage of inhibitor formulations using above<br>
solid additives is that non-uniformity of these formulations,<br>
particularly after ageing, leads to inferior performances and<br>
even catastrophes due to failure of inhibition resulting from<br>
uncontrolled burning of the propellant.<br>
Other inhibition formulations known in the art are<br>
cellulose acetate/ethyl cellulose and Polyester resin for<br>
nitramine based propel 1 ants.<br>
The disadvantage of these inhibition formulation is<br>
that they are very stiff as their strength is very high as<br>
compared to nitramine based propellant and as a result of this<br>
the inhibitor propellant interface bonding is adversely affected<br>
during thermal cycling or storage of the propellant.<br>
Another inhibition formulation for nitramine<br>
propellents known in the art is styrene butadiene.<br>
The disadvantage of using styrene batadiene as<br>
inhibition formulation is that it utilises asbestor which is<br>
highly toxic and as banned in many countries.<br>
Another disadvantage of using styrene butadiene as<br>
inhibition formulation is that it is very stif<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
The primary object of the present invention is to<br>
propose an inhibition composition for rocket propellants and a<br>
process for preparation thereof.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to propose<br>
an inhibition composition which is homogeneous with the HTPB<br>
matrix of inhibitor/liner.<br>
Yet another- object of the present invention is to<br>
propose an inhibition composition which uses a reactive dual<br>
purpose additive which acts both as a flame retardant as well as<br>
aclhesi ve.<br>
Still another object of the present invention is to<br>
propose an inhibition composition which remains unaffected during<br>
ageing of the propellant.<br>
4 -<br>
Further object of the present invention is to propose<br>
an inhibition composition which possesses high bond-strength of<br>
:i. nhita i tor-prope 11 ant interface .<br>
Yet further object of the present invention is to<br>
propose an inhibition composition whose mechanical properties are<br>
higher as compared to that of the propellent.<br>
Still further object of the present invention is to<br>
propose an inhibition compositon which results in minimum<br>
migration of plasticiser (nitroglycerine) towards the interface<br>
over a period of time, thereby maintaining the performance of the<br>
props 11 an t,<br>
Other object of the present invention is to propose an<br>
inhibition composition which has higher pot life thereby<br>
improving the processabi1ity and facilitating the application of<br>
inhibitor formulation to the propellant.<br>
Yet other object of the present invention is to propose<br>
sn inhibition composition of which the inhibi tor-prope 1.1. ant bond<br>
is not adversely affected during thermal cycling over a wide<br>

ABSTRACT OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides an inhibitor composition<br>
containing a dual purpose additive which can act both as a flame<br>
retardant and adhesive for hydroxyl terminated polybutacli ene<br>
(HTPB) based inhibitor/liner for rocket propellant. The additive<br>
also is hydroxyl terminated and, therefore, on curing with a<br>
diisocynate gets cross-linked with the HTPB matrix of the<br>
inhibitor/ 1iner , thereby eliminating the disadvantages of using<br>
heterogeneous additives like Sb0 . The new cured formulation<br>
: 2 3<br>
shows significantly better mechanical properties and flame<br>
retardancy as compared to the formulations known in the art<br>
containing Sta0 . The new cured formulation also shows adequate<br>
2 3<br>
adhesive properties. Both the properties are achieved by the use<br>
of the dual purpose additive, which is polyphosphate ester<br>
ip repo 1 yme r (PEP ) .<br>

The new cured formulation shows significantly better mechanical properties and flame retardancy as compared to the formulations known in the art containing Sb2O3. The new cured formulation also shows adequate adhesive properties. Both the properties are achieved by the use of the dual purpose additive, which is polyphosphate ester prepolymer (PEP).<br><br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
In accordance with this invention a mixture is prepared containing hydroxyl terminated poly butadiene (HTPB) binder is taken in 75 to 85% preferably 78 to 82% by weight, with 5 to 15% preferably 8 to 10% by weight of polyphosphate ester prepolymer (PEP) and 2 to 10% preferably 4 to 6% of dioctyl adipate. The mixture prepared is mixed using a mechanical stirrer and heating to around 60°C in an oven for around 30 minute till PEP is dissolved completely. To such a mixture is added 0.2 to 1.2% preferably 0.4 to 0.6% by weight of pyroggallol, 0.05 to 0.15% preferably 0.075 to 0.125% of ferric acetyl acetonate, which is mixed till pyrogallol and FeAA dissolved completely. Upon pyrogallol and FeAA being dissolved, 15 to 25% preferably 18 to 22% of C black is added in small increments with continuous stirring for about 5 minute to ensure uniform mixing. The mixture is deaerated for about 30 minutes in vacuum (
<br>
to the numerical values is only by way of an<br>
advantageous example.<br>
This invention will now be illustrated with a working<br>
example which is intended to be a typical example to illustrate<br>
the working of the present invention and is not intended to be<br>
taken restrictedly to imply any limitation to the scope of the<br>
press n t i n v e n t i on .<br>
:WQRKI.NG EXAMPLJE<br>
To 58 g of HTPB, taken in a 1 litre glass beaker, was<br>
added 10 g of PEP and 5g of dioctyl adipate and mixed well using<br>
o<br>
a mechanical stirrer. The mixture was heated to 60 C in an oven<br>
till PEP dissolved completely (~30 minute). 0.5 g of pyrogallol<br>
and 0.08g of FeFF were added to the HPTB matrix and mixed well<br>
ensuring completely dissolution of pyrogallol and FeAA. Further<br>
18g of C-black was added in small increments with continuous<br>
stirring (^5 minute) to ensure uniform mixing. The mixgture was<br>
deaerated for 30 minutes in vacuum «5 mm of Hg). Finally 9 g of<br>
1'PDI was added, mixed well and again deaerated for 10 minutes.<br>
The mix was cast into sheets of uniform thickness (2.5 to 3.0<br>
o<br>
mm). The sheets were cured at 45 C for 8 days and evaluated for<br>
mechanical, thermal and ainterface properties.<br>
The same formulation was used for inhibition of<br>
propellent by bottom casting technique using requisite moulds.<br>
The inhibitor was cured, extracted and statically evaluated.<br>

OF RESULTS:....<br>
The result® of the evaluation of the PEP containing<br>
formulation is summarised in the table below, along with<br>
comparative data of the control formulation and that coritianing<br>

As the above table shows that the inhibitor formulation<br>
of present invention incorporating PEP, has significantly highertensile<br>
strength as compared to the control as well as the Sb 0<br>
2 3<br>
containing formulation thus making the cured composition tougher<br>
and matching in tensile strength with the propellent. This makes<br>
the bond between the propellent and inhibitor better and there is<br>
less chance of debonding under conditions of stress. The */.<br>
Elongation of the cured sheet is more or less the same as that of<br>
the control but better than the Sb 0 containing formulation.<br>

This means that on PEP incorporation, tougher but flexible sheets<br>
are obtained. The I...OI which is a measure of flame retardancy is<br>
the highest in the case of the PEP containing sheet.<br>
