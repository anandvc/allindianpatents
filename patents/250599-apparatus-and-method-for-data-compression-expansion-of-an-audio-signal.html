				<td>The invention relates to an apparatus and method for data compression <br>
 expansion of an audio signal, a transmitter comprising the data<br>
compression apparatus, a recording apparatus comprising the data compression apparatus, a<br>
record carrier having the data compressed audio signal recorded on it in a track of said<br><br>
record carrier, the data expansion apparatus being for data expanding a data compressed audio<br>
signal, to a data expansion method, a receiver comprising the data expansion apparatus and<br>
to a reproducing apparatus comprising the data expansion apparatus.<br>
Data compression on an audio signal is well known in the art. Reference<br>
is made in this respect to EP-A 402,973, document Dl in the list of related documents. The<br>
document describes a subband coder, in which an audio signal is A/D converted with a<br>
specific sampling frequency, such as 44.1 kHz, and the resulting samples in de form of eg.<br>
24 bits wide words of the audio signal, are supplied to a subband splitter filter. The subband<br>
splitter filter splits the wideband digital audio signal into a plurality of relatively narrow band<br>
subband signals. Using a psycho acoustic model, a masked threshold is derived and blocks of<br>
samples of the subband signals are subsequently quantised with a specific number of bits per<br>
sample for each block of the subband signals, in response to said masked threshold, resulting<br>
in a significant data compression of the audio signal to be transmitted. The data compression<br>
carried out is based on 'throwing away' those components in the audio signal that are<br>
inaudible and is thus a lossy compression method. The data compression described in<br>
document Dl is a rather intelligent data compression method and requires a substantial<br>
number of gates or instructions, when realized in hard or software respectively, so that it is<br>
expensive. Moreover, the subsequent expansion apparatus also requires a substantial number<br>
of gates or instructions, when realized in hardware or software respectively.<br>
The invention aims at providing a data compression apparatus for data<br>
compressing an audio signal such that it is more simple and that the corresponding expander<br>
apparatus can also be more simple and less expensive.<br>
The data compression apparatus in accordance with the invention<br>
comprises<br>
input means for receiving the audio signal,<br>
conversion means for carrying out a conversion on the audio signal so as to<br>
obtain a 1-bit bitstream signal, the conversion means comprising sigma-delta<br>
modulator means,<br>
lossless coding means for carrying out a substantially lossless data compression<br>
step on the bitstream signal so as to obtain a data compressed bitstream signal,<br>
and<br>
output means for supplying the data compressed bitstream signal. More specifi-<br>
cally, when the audio signal is an analog audio signal, the conversion means is<br>
in the form of A/D conversion means for carrying out a I-bit A/D conversion<br>
on the analog audio signal so as to obtain said bitstream signal.<br>
The invention is based on the following recognition. The audio signal can<br>
be applied in analog form or in digital form. When A/D converting, in accordance with the<br>
invention, an analog audio signal with a 1-bit A/D converter (also named: bitstream<br>
converter or sigma-delta modulator), the audio signal to be A/D converted is sampled with a<br>
frequency which is generally a multiplicity of the frequency of 44.1 kHz or 48 kHz. The<br>
output signal of the 1-bit A/D converter is a binary signal, named bitstream signal. When the<br>
audio signal is supplied in digital form, sampled at eg. 44.1 kHz, the samples being<br>
expressed in eg. 16 bits per sample, this digital audio signal is oversampled with a frequency<br>
which is again a multiplicity of this sampling frequency of 44.1 kHz (or 48 kHz), which<br>
results in the 1-bit bitstream signal.<br>
Converting an audio signal into a 1-bit bitstream signal has a number of<br>
advantages. Bitstream conversion is a high quality encoding method, with the possibility of a<br>
high quality decoding or a low quality decoding with the further advantage of a simpler<br>
decoding circuit. Reference is made in this respect to the publications 'A digital decimating<br>
filter for analog-to-digital conversion of hi-fi audio signals', by J.J. van der Kam, document<br>
D2 in the list of related documents, and 'A higher order topology for interpolative modu-<br>
lators for oversampling A/D converters', by Kirk C.H. Chao et al, document D3 in the list<br>
of related documents.<br>
1-bit D/A converters are used in CD players, as an example, to reconvert<br>
the bitstream audio signal into an analog audio signal. The audio signal recorded on a CD<br>
disk is however not a data compressed 1-bit bitstream signal.<br>
It is well known in the art that the resulting bitstream signal of the 1-bit<br>
A/D converter is, roughly said, a random signal which has a 'noisy-like' frequency spec-<br>
trum. Such types of signals are hard to data compress.<br>
Surprisingly, however, it was established that using a lossless coder, such<br>
as a variable length coder in the form of a Huffman coder or an arithmetic coder, a<br>
significant data reduction could be obtained, in spite of the noisy character of the bitstream<br>
signal from the 1-bit A/D converter.<br>
These and other aspects of the invention will be apparent from and<br>
elucidated further with reference to the embodiments described in the following figure<br>
description of the accompanying drawings.<br>
figure 1 shows an embodiment of the data compression apparatus,<br>

A/D converter and figure 2b shows the frequency spectrum of the same output signal in a<br>
smaller frequency range,<br>

apparatus for recording the data compressed bitstream signal on a record carrier,<br>

mission apparatus for transmitting the data compressed bitstream signal via a transmission<br>
medium,<br>

figure 7 shows the data expansion apparatus incorporated in a receiving<br>
apparatus for receiving the data compressed bitstream signal from a transmission medium.<br>
figure 8 shows a further embodiment of the recording apparatus further<br>
provided with an error correction encoder and a channel encoder,<br>
figure 9 shows a further embodiment of the reproducing apparatus further<br>
provided with a channel decoder and an error correction unit,<br>
figure 10 shows an embodiment of the data compression apparatus in<br>
which the lossless coder is in the form of an arithmetic coder, and<br>
figure 11 shows an embodiment of the data expansion apparatus in which<br><br>
the lossless decoder is in the form of an arithmetic decoder.<br>
Figure 1 shows an embodiment of the data compression apparatus,<br>
comprising an input terminal 1 for receiving the audio signal. In the present example, the<br>
audio signal is an analog audio signal. The input terminal 1 is coupled to an input 2 of a 1-<br>
bit A/D converter 4, also called: sigma-delta modulator. An output 6 of the 1-bit A/D<br>
converter 4 is coupled to an input 8 of a data compression unit 10. An output 12 of the data<br>
compression unit 10 is coupled to an output terminal 14.<br>
The 1-bit A/D converter 4 is adapted to carry out a 1-bit A/D conversion<br>
on the audio signal so as to obtain a bitstream signal which is supplied to the output 6. To<br>
that purpose, the A/D converter 4 receives a sampling frequency equal to N.fs via an input<br>
16. fs is a frequency equal to eg. 32 kHz, 44.1 kHz or 48 kHz and N is a large number,<br>
such as 64. The audio signal is sampled in the A/D converter 4 with a sampling frequency of<br>
eg. 2.8224 MHz (64 x 44.1 kHz). The bitstream signal appearing at the output 6 of the A/D<br>
converter thus has a bitrate of 2.8224 MHz.<br>
The data compression unit 10 is in the form of a lossless coder. lossless<br>
coders have the advantage that they can data compress the audio signal in such a way that,<br>
after data expansion by a lossless decoder, the original audio signal can be reconstructed in a<br>
substantially lossless way. That means that there is substantially no loss of information after<br>
compression-expansion. Lossless coders can be in the form of a variable length coder.<br>
Variable length coders are well known in the art. Examples of such variable length coders<br>
are Huffman coders, arithmetic coders and Lempel-Ziv coders. Reference is made in this<br>
respect to the publications 'A method for the construction of minimum-redundancy codes' by<br>
D.A. Huffman, document D4 in the list of related documents, 'An introduction to arithmetic<br>
coding' by G.G. Langdon, document D5 in the list of related documents, and 'A universal<br>
algorithm for sequential data compression' by J. Ziv et al, document D6 in the list of related<br>
documents.<br>
The data compression unit 10 carries out a substantially lossless data<br>
compression step on the bitstream signal so as to obtain a data compressed bitstream signal at<br>
its output 12, which is supplied to the output terminal 14.<br>
Figure 2a shows a frequency spectrum of the bitstream signal present at<br>
the output 6 of the A/D converter 4, for an input signal in the form of a 5 kHz sinusoid,<br>
sampled with a sampling frequency of 2.8224 MHz. The spectrum thus shows frequencies<br>
between 0 Hz and 1.4 MHz. Figure 2b shows part of the spectrum shown in figure 2a,<br>
namely that part between 0 Hz and 100 kHz, so as to more clearly show the 5 kHz sinusoid<br>
comprised in the bitstream signal. Clearly visible is the noise-like character of the bitstream<br>
signal, especially in the higher frequency region, which seems to imply that carrying out data<br>
compression on the said signal will not result in a substantial amount of data reduction.<br>
Contrary to this, investigations have made clear that a significant data<br>
reduction can be obtained. In the following table, the results of the data compression realized<br>
by three lossless coders are given for three different music fragments:<br>
where 6 is the compression ratio, defined as the ratio of the bitrate of the input signal of the<br>
coder to the bitrate of the output signal of the coder.<br>
Figure 3 shows an embodiment of a recording apparatus comprising the<br>
data compression apparatus shown in figure 1. The recording apparatus further comprises a<br>
write unit 30 for writing the data compressed bitstream signal in a track on the record carrier<br>
32. In the present example, the record carrier 32 is a magnetic record carrier, so that the<br>
write unit 30 comprises at least one magnetic head 34 for writing the data compressed<br>
bitstream signal in the record carrier 32. The record carrier may however be an optical<br>
record carrier, such as a CD disk or a DVD disk.<br>
Figure 4 shows an embodiment of a transmitter for transmitting an audio<br>
signal via a transmission medium TRM, comprising the data compression apparatus as shown<br>
in figure 1. The transmitter further comprises a transmission unit 40 for applying the data<br>
compressed bitstream signal to the transmission medium TRM. The transmission unit 40<br>
could comprise an antenna 42.<br>
Transmission via a transmission medium, such as a radio frequency link<br>
or a record carrier, generally requires an error correction encoding and a channel encoding<br>
carried out on the data compressed bitstream signal to be transmitted. Figure 8 shows such<br>
signal processing steps carried out on the data compressed bitstream signal for the recording<br>
arrangement of figure 3. The recording arrangement of figure 8 therefore comprises an error<br>
correction encoder 80, well known in the art, and a channel encoder 82, also well known in<br>
the art.<br>
Figure 5 shows an embodiment of the data expansion apparatus. The<br>
apparatus has an input terminal 50 for receiving the data compressed audio signal which is in<br>
the form of the data compressed bitstream signal, as supplied by the data compression<br>
apparatus of figure 1. The input terminal 50 is coupled to an input 52 of a data expansion<br>
unit 54, which has an output 56 which is coupled to an input 58 of a 1-bit D/A converter 60.<br>
An output 62 of the converter 60 is coupled to an output terminal 64.<br>
The data expansion unit 54 is a lossless decoder, such as a variable length<br>
decoder in the form of eg. a Huffman decoder or an arithmetic decoder. It will be clear that<br>
the decoder in the data expansion apparatus of figure 5 should be the inverse of the encoder<br>
used in the data compression apparatus of figure 1, in order to realize a substantially lossless<br>
encoding-decoding step. The data expansion unit 54 expands the data compressed bitstream<br>
so as to obtain a replica of the original bitstream, which is supplied to the input 58 of the<br>
D/A converter 60. The converter 60 converts the bitstream into an analog audio signal which<br>
is supplied to the terminal 64.<br>
Figure 6 shows the data expansion apparatus of figure 5 incorporated in a<br>
reproduction apparatus. The reproducing apparatus further comprises a read unit 70 for<br>
reading the data compressed bitstream signal from a track on the record carrier 32. In the<br>
present example, the record carrier 32 is a magnetic record carrier, so that the read unit 70<br>
comprises at least one magnetic head 72 for reading the data compressed bitstream signal<br>
from the record carrier 32. The record carrier may however be an optical record carrier,<br>
such as a CD disk or a DVD disk.<br>
Figure 7 shows an embodiment of a receiver for receiving an audio signal<br>
via a transmission medium TRM, comprising the data expansion apparatus as shown in figure<br>
5. The receiver further comprises a receiving unit 75 for receiving the data compressed<br>
bitstream signal from the transmission medium TRM. The receiving unit 75 could comprise<br>
an antenna 77.<br>
As has been explained above, transmission via a transmission medium,<br>
such as a radio frequency link or a record carrier, generally requires an error correction<br>
encoding and a channel encoding carried out on the data compressed bitstream signal to be<br>
transmitted, so that a corresponding channel decoding and error correction can be carried out<br><br>
upon reception. Figure 9 shows the signal processing steps of channel decoding and error<br>
correction carried out on the received signal, received by the reading means 70 for the<br>
reproducing arrangement of figure 6. The reproducing arrangement of figure 9 therefore<br>
comprise a channel decoder 90, well known in the art, and an error correction unit 92, also<br>
well known in the art, so as to obtain a replica of the data compressed bitstream signal.<br>
Another data compression apparatus is shown in figure 10. In the data<br>
compression apparatus of figure 10, the bitstream signal is supplied to an input 8 of a<br>
lossless coder, which is in the form of an entropy coder, such as an arithmetic coder 154.<br>
Further the bitstream signal is also an input of a prediction filter unit 152. An output of the<br>
prediction filter unit 152 is coupled to an input of a probability determining unit 156. The<br>
arithmetic coder 154 encodes the bitstream signal into a data compressed bitstream signal in<br>
response to probability values p supplied to its input 192. The probability determining unit<br>
156 determines a probability value indicating the probability that a bit in the bitstream signal<br>
supplied by the converter unit 4 has a predetermined logical value, such as '1'. This<br>
probability value, denoted p in figure 10, is supplied to the arithmetic coder 154 so as to<br>
enable the data compression of the bitstream signal in the arithmetic coder 154. The<br>
determining unit 156 determines this probability value from the output signal of the predic-<br>
tion filter 152. The arithmetic coder 154 can data compress the bitstream signal on a frame-<br>
by-frame basis.<br>
The functioning of the apparatus of figure 10 is as follows. The prediction filter<br>
152 realizes a prediction filtering on the bitstream signal so as to obtain a multi bit output<br>
signal. The multi bit output signal has a plurality of levels within a range of eg. -1-3 and -3.<br>
Further, for each of a plurality of subintervals in the value range of the multi bit output<br>
signal, it is determined what the probability is that the corresponding bit in the bitstream<br>
signal is eg. a T bit. This can be realized by counting the number of 'ones' and 'zeroes'<br>
occurring in the bitstream signal during a specific time interval, when the multi bit output<br>
signal falls in one of such ranges. The probabilities thus obtained for the various values in<br>
the multi bit output signal are subsequently supplied as the probability signal p to the<br>
arithmetic coder 154. The data compressed bitstream signal is supplied by the arithmetic<br>
coder 154 to an output line 158, for transmission via a transmission medium TRM or a<br>
record carrier.<br>
Figure 11 shows a corresponding data expansion apparatus for decoding the<br>
data compressed bitstream signal, received via the transmission medium TRM. The data<br>
processing apparatus of figure 11 comprises an entropy decoder 172, which receives the data<br><br>
compressed bitstream signal via an input 174. In the present example, the entropy decoder<br>
172 is in the form of an arithmetic decoder that carries out an arithmetic decoding step on<br>
the data compressed bitstream signal under the influence of a probability signal p, supplied to<br>
an input 176 so as to generate a replica of the original bitstream signal which is supplied to<br>
an output 178. The replica is supplied to an input 58 of the reconverter unit 60.<br>
Further, a probability supply unit 180 is present for supplying the probability<br>
signal p to the arithmetic decoder 172. The probability signal p can be obtained in different<br>
ways, dependent on how the probability signal has been derived in the encoder. One way is,<br>
to derive the probability signal p in an adaptive way from the output signal of a prediction<br>
filter 181. In this embodiment, the prediction filter 181 is equivalent to the prediction filter<br>
152 in the encoder and the probability supply unitl80 is equivalent to the probability<br>
determining unit 156 in the encoder of figure 10. Another way of generating the probability<br>
signal p, is by using side information received via the transmission medium TRM, as will be<br>
explained hereafter.<br>
Side information can be generated by the apparatus of figure 10 for trans-<br>
mission to the apparatus of figure 11. Such side information can include the filter coefficients<br>
for the filter 152 that are determined on a frame by frame basis, which coefficients are<br>
transmitted to the corresponding prediction filter included in the unit 180.<br>
Further, the apparatus of figure 10 can generate parameters that describe the<br>
conversion of the multi bit output signal of the prediction filter 152 into the probability signal<br>
p. Such parameters are also included in the side information and transmitted to the supply<br>
unit 180 and the filter 181, so as to enable the regeneration of the probability signal p in the<br>
apparatus of figure 11 on the basis of the multi bit output signal provided by the prediction<br>
filter 181.<br>
The entropy encoder used in the embodiment of figure 10 is adapted to encode<br>
the bitstream signal using a probability signal in order to obtain the data compressed<br>
bitstream signal. One such entropy encoder is the arithmetic coder described above. One<br>
other type of such entropy coder is, as an example, the well known finite state coder. The<br>
entropy decoder used in the embodiment of figure 11 is adapted to decode the data com-<br>
pressed bitstream signal using a probability signal in order to obtain a replica of the bitstream<br>
signal. One such entropy decoder is the arithmetic decoder described above. One other type<br>
of such entropy decoder is, as an example, the well known finite state decoder.<br>
Whilst the invention has been described with reference to preferred embodi-<br>
ments thereof, it is to be understood that these are not limitative examples. Thus, various<br>
modifications may become apparent to those skilled in the art, without departing from the<br>
scope of the invention, as defined by the claims. When the audio signal is supplied in digital<br>
form, such as sampled at 44.1 kHz and the samples being expressed in eg. 16 bits, the<br>
conversion means are adapted to oversample the digital audio signal with eg. the frequency<br>
 of 64 X 44.1 kHz so as to obtain the 1-bit bitstream signal.<br>
It should further be noted that the invention also applies to an embodiment in<br>
which the bitstream signal, as supplied by the converter 4 has undergone an additional signal<br>
processing step resulting in a processed 1-bit bitstream signal that is supplied to the lossless<br>
coder 10. Such additional signal processing step could include merging a left and right hand<br>
 signal component of a stereo audio signal, in 1-bit bitstream form, into a processed 1-bit<br>
bitstream signal.<br>
Further, the invention lies in each and every novel feature or combination<br>
of features.<br><br>
