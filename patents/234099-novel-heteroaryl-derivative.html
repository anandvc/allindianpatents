DESCRIPTION<br>
NOVEL HETEROARYL DERIVATIVE<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a novel heteroaryl compound having anti-diabetic activity or a salt thereof.    More particularly, the present invention relates to a novel heteroaryl compound having an anti-diabetic activity, which improves insulin resistance and control the blood glucose level more safely. Further particularly, the present invention relates to a novel heteroaryl compound that simulates activity of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) a, a PPARy, or PPARa/y, or that regluates activity of activation of PPARa/y.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
The number of patients with diabetes mellitus has been increasing steadily owing to the recent change in the lifestyle.   According to the research done in 1997 in Japan, it has been speculated that the number of people diagnosed as possibly having diabetic mellitus is 6.9 million, and the number of people who cannot be ruled out the possibility of diabetes mellitus is 6.8 million. Most of the patients with diabetes mellitus in Japan are classified into type 2 diabetes mellitus, wherein the basal pathological conditions thereof sire the reduced output of insulin and the insulin resistance, and medicaments against to each condition have been developed.<br>
Sulfonylurea (SU) agents, which have long been known, and widely used for improving the reduced output of insulin, however, have been known to have a risk of hypoglycemia as a serious side effect, and further to maybe cause obesity to patients.<br>
On the other hand, thiazolidinedione agents have been known as an insulin resistance improving agent.<br><br>
Troglitazone was put on market first as a thiazolidinedione agent, but it induced a serious hepatic damage, by which the selling thereof was discontinued.   In Japan, pioglitazone has been used clinically at the present, but the heart failure due to the increase in circulating plasma volume was reported as a serious side effect thereof, and hence, Urgent Safety Information on pioglitazone was issued on October, 2000, which announced that pioglitazone needs careful attention to heart failure and edema.   As to rosiglitazone, which has been widely used in the western countries, there are reported side effects such as infection of upper respiratory tract, anemia, edema, weight gain, etc., and a thiazolidinedione agent having no concern regarding hepatitis damage or side effects on the cardiovascular system has not been put on the market yet.<br>
Thiazolidinedione agents have been thought to exhibit anti-diabetic activity by activating PPARy.    It is known that PPAR has subtypes such as a, y, 8 (P), etc., and fibrate agents (e.g., clofibrate, fenoflbrate, etc.), which have been used as antidyslipidemic agent, have been considered to exhibit their pharmacological activities by activating PPARa.    It has recently been reported that the insulin resistance is improved by administering a PPARa activator to animal models (cf., Journal of Biological Chemistry, vol. 275, p 16638, 2000), and there is a growing possibility where PPARa activators may show an effectiveness against not only hyperlipidemia but also diabetes mellitus.<br>
Many of compounds activating PPARy or both PPARa and PPARy such as isoxazolidediones are reported other than thiazolidinedione agents (cf., Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, 43, p. 527, 2000), but the efficacy and safety thereof in the clinical field are not confirmed yet.    At the present, PPARa agonists, PPARy agonists, PPARa/y agonists or PPARa/y activation regulators having a good antidiabetic activity and high safety have been desired.<br>
In addition, diabetic medicines having a pyrrole group have been known (cf., JP-A-2002-121186, WO 02/085851, WO 2004/048341), but the efficacy and safety thereof in the clinical field are not reported yet.<br><br>
DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide an agent for preventing or treating diabetes mellitus, which shows PPARa activating activity, PPARy activating activity, or PPARa/y activating activity, and improves insulin resistance and further shows a high safety.<br>
The present inventors have intensively studied, and have found that a novel heteroaiyl derivative improves hyperglycemia by activating PPARa, PPARy, or PPARa/v by improving insulin resistance and hyperlipidemia condition, and further shows a good safety, and are useful in the prophylaxis or treatment of diabetes mellitus, and finally they have accomplished the present invention.<br>

(1995), etc. or a modified method thereof.<br>
The heteroaiyl derivative of the present invention or a prodrug thereof may exist in an asymmetric form or may have a substituent having an asymmetric carbon atom, and in those cases,    the present compounds may exist in the form of an optical isomer.   The present compounds also include a mixture of these isomers or each isolated isomer.    Such optical isomers may be purely isolated, for example, by optical resolution.<br>
The optical resolution may be carried out, for example, by forming a salt with an optically active acid (e.g., monocarboxylic acids such as mandelic acid, N-benzyloxyalanine, lactic acid, etc., dicarboxylic acids such as tartaric acid, o-diisopropyridentartaric acid, malic acid, etc., sulfonic acids such as camphersulfonic acid, bromocamphorsulfonic acid, etc.) in an inert solvent (e.g., alcohols such as methanol, ethanol, 2-propanol, etc., ethers such as diethyl ether, etc., ester solvents such as ethyl acetate, etc., aromatic hydrocarbons such as toluene, etc., acetonitrile, or a mixture of these solvents).<br>
When the heteroaiyl derivative of the present invention or a prodrug thereof or an intermediate thereof has an acidic substituent such as carboxyl group, then it can be made to form a salt with an optically active amine (e.g., organic amines such as a-phenethylamine, 1,2-diphenyl-ethanolamine, (1R,2R)-(-)-2-amino-l,2-diphenylethanol, (lS,2R)-(+)-2-amino-l,2-diphenylethanol, quinine, quinidine, cinchonidine, cinchonine, strychnine, etc.).<br>
The temperature for forming a salt may be in the range of room temperature to a boiling point of the solvent.    In order to improve the optical purity, it is preferable to raise the reaction temperature to a temperature around the boiling point once.   The precipitated salt is cooled, if necessary, prior to collection by filtration, and the yield thereof can be improved.    The amount of the optically active acid or amine is in the range of about 0.5 to about 2.0 equivalents, preferably about 1 equivalent to the substrate.    If necessary, the precipitated crystals are recrystallized in an inert solvent (e.g., alcohols such as methanol, ethanol, 2-propanol, etc., ethers such as diethyl ether, ester solvents<br><br>
such as ethyl acetate, etc., aromatic hydrocarbons such as toluene, etc., acetonitrile, etc., or a mixture thereof) to give an optically active salt in high purity.    If necessary, the obtained salt is treated with an acid or a base by a conventional method to give a free compound.<br>
The heteroaryl derivative of the present invention or a salt thereof can be administered either orally or parenterally.    When administered orally, it can be administered in a conventional dosage form.   When administered parenterally, it can be administered in the form of topical administration formulations, injections, transdermal preparations, intranasal formulations, etc.     The pharmaceutical composition for oral administration or rectal formulations are, for example, capsules, tablets, pills, powders, cachets, suppositories, liquids, etc. The injection preparations are, for example, aseptic solutions or suspensions. The pharmaceutical composition for topical administration is, for example, creams, ointments, lotions, transdermal preparations such as conventional patches, matrixes, etc.<br>

water and propylene glycol solution are exemplified.   The liquid preparation may be prepared in the form of a solution of polyethyleneglycol or/and propyleneglycol which may contain moisture.   The liquid preparation suitable for oral administration may be prepared by adding the present compound into water, and further adding thereto a coloring agent, a flavor, a stabilizer, a sweetening agent, a solubilizer, a thickening agent, etc.     Further the liquid preparation suitable for oral administration may also be prepared by adding the present compound together with a dispersing agent into water and thickening the solution.   The thickening agent is, for example, pharmaceutically acceptable naturally occurring or synthetic gum, resin, methyl cellulose, sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, or a conventional suspending agent.<br>
The formulation for topical administration includes, for example, the above-mentioned liquid preparations, creams, aerosol, sprays, powders, lotions, ointments, etc.     The above-mentioned formulations for topical administration may be prepared by mixing the present compound with a conventional pharmaceutically acceptable diluent or carrier.   The ointment and cream preparations are prepared by adding a thickening agent and/or gelatinizing agent into an aqueous or oily base, and formulating the resultant.

The test compounds as disclosed in Examples were dissolved or suspended in a 0.5 % carbomethyl cellulose solution, and orally administered to male db/db mice (7 to 8 weeks old) at a final dose of 30 mg/kg once a day for 2 weeks.    On the last day, the blood was taken at the tail vein, and immediately thereafter, perchloric acid was added for removing proteins, and the blood glucose level was measured by Glucolse CII Test Wako (Wako Pure Industries, Ltd.).   The results are shown in the following Table 19.<br>
In addition, the hypoglycemic activity was calculated by the following equation.<br>
Blood Glucose Level    _ Blood Glucose Level in Hypoglycemic       jn Vehicle (on Last day)    test compound-treated group (on Last day)<br>
Activity (%)     =	   X 100<br>
