METHOD FOR PROVIDING/RECEIVING DATA OF A MULTICAST SERVICE<br>
IN A RADIO COMMUNICATION SYSTEM, METHOD OF PROVIDING<br>
INTERNET PROTOCOL HEADER INFORMATION TO A PLURALITY OF<br>
TERMINALS, RADIO NETWORK CONTROLLER, USER EQUIPMENT AND<br>
WIRELESS COMMUNICATION SYSTEM THEREFOR<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present Invention relates to a multicast service of a mobile<br>
communication system and, more particularly, to allowing multicasting of data<br>
services in a point-to-muftipoint manner using a structure of a PDCP layer<br>
suitable for a multimedia broadcast/multicast service (MBMS), and its<br>
operation method.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
With the remarkable development in radio mobile communication<br>
technology, mobile phones are used more than wired phones. However, for a<br>
service providing a large amount of data communications above general<br>
voice communications through a radio access network, radio mobile<br>
communication technology is behind in its performance compared to that of<br>
t<br>
the existing cable communication system. A communication system enabling<br>
a large amount of data communication is called an IMT-2000, for which<br>
technological developments and standardization are ongoing in many<br>
countries worldwide.<br>
A universal mobile telecommunications system (UMTS), which is a<br>
European IMT-2000 system, is a third generation mobile communication<br><br><br>
system that has evolved from a standard known as Global System for Mobile<br>
communications (GSM). This standard is a European standard which aims to<br>
provide an improved mobile communication service based on a GSM core<br>
network and wideband code division multiple access (W-CDMA) technology.<br>
In December 1998, the ETSI of Europe, the ARIB/TTC of Japan, the<br>
T1 of the United States, and the TTA of Korea formed a Third Generation<br>
Partnership Project (3GPP) for the purpose of creating the specification for<br>
standardizing the UMTS.<br>
The work toward standardizing the UMTS performed by the 3GPP<br>
has resulted in the formation of five technical specification groups (TSG),<br>
each of which is directed to forming network elements having independent<br>
operations.<br>
More specifically, each TSG develops, approves and manages a<br>
standard specification in a related region. Among them, a radio access<br>
network (RAN) group (TSG-RAN) develops a specification for the function,<br>
items desired, and interface of a UMTS terrestrial radio access network<br>
(UTRAN), which is a new RAN for supporting a W-CDMA access technology<br>
in the UMTS.<br>
Figure 1 shows a network structure of a general UMTS.<br>
As shown in Figure 1, the UMTS is roughly divided into a terminal<br>
(UE: user equipment), a UTRAN and a core network.<br>
The UTRAN includes one or more radio network sub-systems (RNS).<br>
Each RNS includes an RNC and one or more Node Bs managed by the<br><br>
Node Bs are managed by the RNCs, receive information sent by the<br>
physical layer of a terminal (e.g., mobile station, user equipment and/or<br>
subscriber unit) through an uplink, and transmit data to a terminal through a<br>
downlink. Node Bs, thus, operate as access points of the UTRAN for a<br>
terminal.<br>
The RNCs perform functions, which include assigning and managing<br>
radio resources, and operate as an access point with respect to the core<br>
network.<br>
Each terminal connected to the UMTS network is managed by a<br>
specific RNC in the UTRAN, and this RNC is called an SRNC (Serving RNC).<br>
The SRNC serves as an access point to the core network in order to transmit<br>
data of a specific terminal, and allocates a radio resource suitable for<br>
providing a service.<br>
The terminal connected to the core network through the UTRAN has<br>
only one SRNC. In general, one RNC is used for connection between the<br>
terminal and the RNC, but if the terminal moves into a region managed by a<br>
different RNC, it is connected to an SRNC by way of an RNC of the region in<br>
which the terminal has moved. Except for the SRNC, every RNC that the<br>
i<br>
terminal goes through is called a DRNC (Drift RNC), and the DRNC performs<br>
a simple partial function of routing user data or assigning a code, which is a<br>
common resource. That is, the discrimination of the SRNC and the DRNC is<br>
a logical discrimination related to a specific terminal.<br><br>
Meanwhile, the RNC can be discriminated at the Node B according<br>
to a dependent relation of the RNC and the Node B in the UTRAN. An RNC<br>
which handles managing of a specific Node B is called a CRNC (Controlling<br>
RNC), and the CRNC performs functions of controlling a traffic load and<br>
congestion in a cell that the CRNC itself manages and a function of<br>
controlling acceptance of a new radio link set in the cell. In terms of the<br>
structure of the UTRAN, each Node B necessarily has only one CRNC.<br>
The services provided to the specific terminal 10 is roughly divided<br>
into a circuit switched service and a packet switched service. For example, a<br>
general voice phone call service belongs to the circuit switched service, while<br>
a Web browsing service through an Internet connection is classified as the<br>
packet switched service.<br>
In case of supporting the circuit switched service, the RNC 20 is<br>
connected to the MSC 31 of the core network 30, and the MSC 31 is<br>
connected to a GMSC (Gateway Mobile Switching Center) 33 managing a<br>
connection to other networks.<br>
Meanwhile, in case of the packet switched service, services are<br>
provided by a SGSN (Serving GPRS Support Node) 35 and a GGSN<br>
(Gateway GPRS Support Node) 37 of the core network 30.<br>
The SGSN 35 supports a packet communication going toward the<br>
RNC 23, and the GGSN 37 manages connections to other packet switched<br>
networks such as the Internet.<br>
An interface exists between various network components to allow the<br><br>
network components to give and take information to and from each other to<br>
allow mutual communication. A cable interface between the RNC 23 and the<br>
core network 30 is defined as an lu interface. Connection of the lu interface<br>
to the packet switched area is defined as an lu-PS, and connection of the lu<br>
interface to the circuit switched area is defined as an lu-CS.<br>
Figure 2 illustrates a structure of a radio access interface protocol<br>
between a terminal and the UTRAN on the basis of 3GPP radio access<br>
network standard.<br>
As shown in Figure 2, the radio access interface protocol includes<br>
horizontal layers comprising a physical layer, a data link layer and a network<br>
layer, and vertical planes comprising a user plane for transmitting data<br>
information and a control plane for transmitting control signals.<br>
The user plane is a region to which traffic information of a user such<br>
as voice or an IP packet is transmitted. The control plane is a region to which<br>
control information such as an interface of a network or maintenance and<br>
management of a call is transmitted.<br>
In Figure 2, the protocol layers can be divided into L1 (a first layer),<br>
L2 (a second layer), and L3 (a third layer) based on three lower layers of an<br>
open system interconnection (OSI) standard model well known in the art of<br>
communication systems.<br>
The L1 layer provides an information transfer service to the second<br>
layer, (which is an upper layer) by using various radio transfer techniques.<br>
The L1 layer is connected to the MAC layer through a transport channel, and<br><br>
data is transferred between the MAC layer and the PHY layer through the<br>
transport channel.<br>
The L2 layer includes a medium access control (MAC) layer, a radio<br>
link control (RLC) layer, a packet data convergence protocol (PDCP) layer<br>
and a broadcast/multicast control (BMC) layer.<br>
The MAC layer handles a mapping between the logical channel and<br>
the transport channel, and provides a re-allocation service of the MAC<br>
parameter for allocation and re-allocation of radio resources.<br>
The MAC layer is connected to the radio link control (RLC) layer<br>
(which is an upper layer) through a logical channel, and various logical<br>
channels are provided according to the kind of transmitted information.<br>
In general, when information of the control plane is transmitted, a<br>
control channel is used. When information of the user plane is transmitted, a<br>
traffic channel is used.<br>
The MAC layer is connected to the physical layer (which is a lower<br>
layer) through the transport channel, and as the transport channel, a<br>
common channel or a dedicated channel is used depending upon whether<br>
the channel is shared or not.<br>
The MAC layer is divided into a MAC-b sublayer, a MAC-d sublayer,<br>
and a MAC-c/sh sublayer, according to the type of transport channel being<br>
managed. The MAC-b sublayer manages a broadcast channel (BCH)<br>
handling the broadcast of various data and system information, while the<br>
MAC-c/sh sublayer manages a shared transport channel such as a forward<br><br>
access channel (FACH), a downlink shared channel (DSCH), or the like,<br>
being shared with other terminals.<br>
In the UTRAN, the MAC-c/sh sublayer is located in a control RNC<br>
(CRNC) and manages channels shared by all terminals in a cell, so that one<br>
MAC-c/sh sublayer exists for each cell. A MAC-c/sh sublayer also exists in<br>
each terminal 10, respectively.<br>
The MAC-d sublayer manages a dedicated channel (DCH), which is<br>
a dedicated transport channel for a specific terminal 10. Accordingly, the<br>
MAC-d sublayer is located in a serving RNC (SRNC) that manages a<br>
corresponding terminal 10, and one MAC-d sublayer also exists in each<br>
terminal 10.<br>
A radio link control (RLC) layer provides support for reliable data<br>
transmissions, and may perform a function of segmentation and<br>
concatenation of an RLC service data unit (SDU) coming from a higher layer.<br>
The RLC SDU transferred from the higher layer is adjusted in its size<br>
according to a throughput capacity at the RLC layer, to which header<br>
information is added, and is then transferred to the MAC layer in the form of a<br>
protocol data unit (PDU). The RLC layer includes an RLC buffer for storing<br>
the RLC SDU or the RLC PDU coming from the higher layer.<br>
A packet data convergence protocol (PDCP) layer is located at an<br>
upper layer from the RLC layer, allowing data to be transmitted effectively on<br>
a radio interface with a relatively small bandwidth through a network protocol,<br>
such as the IPv4 or the IPv6. For this purpose, the PDCP layer performs the<br><br>
function of reducing unnecessary control information used in a wired network,<br>
and this function is called header compression. These methods allow<br>
transmission of only the absolutely necessary information required in the<br>
header part of a data, and thus transmitting a smaller amount of control<br>
information can reduce the overall amount of data to be transmitted.<br>
A broadcast / multicast control (BMC) layer schedules a cell<br>
broadcast (CB) message transferred from the core network and transmits the<br>
cell broadcast message to a specific cell, whereby every terminal positioned<br>
in the cell perform the cell broadcast message. Especially, the BMC layer is<br>
used for handling only the broadcast function, and the CB message is a short<br>
message consisting of a maximum 1230 octets which only include characters<br>
and numbers transmitted between terminals or between a terminal and a<br>
system.<br>
At the UTRAN 100, the CB message transferred from the upper layer<br>
is combined with information, such as a message ID (identification), a serial<br>
number, a coding scheme, etc., and transferred to the RLC layer in the form<br>
of a BMC message. The BMC message is transmitted to the MAC layer<br>
through a common traffic channel (CTCH), which is a logical channel. Here,<br>
the logical channel CTCH is mapped to a FACH transport channel, and the<br>
FACH transport channel is mapped to a physical channel, that is, a<br>
secondary common control physical channel (S-CCPCH).<br>
The radio resource control (RRC) layer located at the lowest portion<br>
of the third layer (L3) is only defined in the control plane, and controls the<br><br>
transport channels and the physical channels in relation to the setup, the<br>
reconfiguration, and the release (cancellation) of the radio bearers (RBs).<br>
Here, the RB signifies a service provided by the second layer (L2) for data<br>
transmission between the terminal 10 and the UTRAN 100. In general, the<br>
set up of the RB refers to the process of stipulating the characteristics of a<br>
protocol layer and a channel required for providing a specific data service,<br>
and setting the respective detailed parameters and operation methods.<br>
The RLC layer may be part of the user plane or the control plane in<br>
accordance with an upper layer connected thereto. The RLC layer is part of<br>
the control plane when data is received from the RRC layer, and the RLC<br>
layer is part of the user plane in all other instances.<br>
As can be understood from Figure 2, regarding the RLC layer and<br>
the PDCP layer, a plurality of entities may exist in a single layer thereof. This<br>
is because one terminal may have many radio (wireless) carriers, and<br>
typically, only one RLC entity and one PDCP entity is used for each radio<br>
bearer.<br>
However, the cell broadcast service provided by the existing BMC<br>
layer does not only support a multicast function but also have limitations in<br>
providing a multimedia service, because it can transmit only a short message<br>
with a maximum size of 1230 octets. For this reason, a new service called a<br>
multimedia broadcast/multicast service (MBMS) has been proposed.<br>
As shown in Figure 3, the MBMS is a service for simultaneously<br>
transmitting multimedia data such as audio, video or image data to a plurality<br><br>
of terminals by using a uni-directional point-to-multipoint bearer service,<br>
which supports a broadcast mode and a multicast mode.<br>
The MBMS is divided into a broadcast mode and a multicast mode.<br>
That is, the MBMS is divided into an MBMS broadcast service and an MBMS<br>
multicast service.<br>
The MBMS broadcast mode is a service for transmitting multimedia<br>
data to every user in a broadcast area. The broadcast area means an area in<br>
which a broadcast service is available. One or more broadcast areas may<br>
exist in one PLMN, one or more broadcast services can be provided in one<br>
broadcast area, and one broadcast service can be provided to several<br>
broadcast areas.<br>
The MBMS multicast mode is a service for transmitting multimedia<br>
data only to a specific user group existing in a multicast area. The multicast<br>
area means an area in which a multicast service is available. One or more<br>
multicast areas can exist in one PLMN (public land mobile network), one or<br>
more multicast services can be provided in one multicast area, and one<br>
multicast service can be provided to several multicast areas.<br>
In general, the MBMS is a service for broadcasting or multicasting<br>
multimedia data and the size of a transmitted packet is considerably large.<br>
Thus, by compressing a header portion occupying a large part of a packet in<br>
the MBMS by using a header compression technique, data transmission<br>
efficiency can be improved. Because the MBMS is a uni-directiona! point-to-<br>
multipoint service, a header compressor in the UTRAN at a sending end<br><br>
transmits the same data to header decompressors in the terminals at a<br>
receiving end.<br>
As mentioned above, the MBMS can improve data transmission<br>
efficiency by compressing the header part of multimedia data by using the<br>
header compression technique.<br>
In the conventional art, as shown in Figure 4, the PDCP layer<br>
handling the header compression is positioned at the SRNC of a specific<br>
terminal and of UTRAN, and at this time, a compressed packet is transmitted<br>
and received through a dedicated transport channel.<br>
In other words, as for the MBMS service provided according to the<br>
conventional art, a header part of MBMS data is compressed in a PDCP<br>
layer of the SRNC managing a resource of a specific terminal and<br>
transmitted to a terminal through the dedicated transport channel.<br>
In this case, because the MBMS service has characteristics of<br>
simultaneously broadcasting and multicasting the same data to a plurality of<br>
terminals, the number of PDCP entities existing at the SRNC is equal to the<br>
number of terminals in a cell for every type of MBMS service.<br>
However, because the MBMS data transmitted after being<br>
compressed in the PDCP layer of the SRNC have the same content, the<br>
repetitive PDCP entities existing at the SRNC considerably wastes the<br>
resources of the UTRAN system and radio resources.<br><br>
Therefore, an object of the present invention is to provide a PDCP<br>
structure capable of allowing a resource of a UTRAN system and a radio<br>
resource to be effectively used.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a PDCP<br>
structure in which every specific MBMS service has one PDCP entity for a<br>
cell.<br>
Still another object of the present invention is to provide a PDCP<br>
structure in which a PDCP layer is provided in a CRNC and to provide a data<br>
transmission method thereof.<br>
To achieve at least the above objects in whole or in part, there is<br>
provided a PDCP structure in a wireless system which compresses a header<br>
of multimedia service data and multicasts it through a downlink, wherein an<br>
entity handling a header compression of multimedia service data is<br>
positioned in a control center which manages a common resource of multiple<br>
terminals of a cell.<br>
Preferably, the entity is a packet data convergence protocol (PDCP)<br>
entity.<br>
Preferably, only one entity exists for every specific MBMS service for<br>
one cell.<br>
Preferably, the control center is a control radio network controller<br>
(CRNC).<br><br>
Preferably, the header-compressed data is transmitted to a terminal<br>
through a common channel, and the common channel is a forward access<br>
channel (FACH) or a downlink shared channel (DSCH).<br>
To achieve at least these advantages in whole or in part, there is<br>
further provided a radio mobile communication system including: a radio<br>
network controller (RNC) for performing a header compression function on<br>
multimedia service data; and a plurality of terminals for receiving the header-<br>
compressed multimedia service data from the RNC through a common<br>
transport channel.<br>
Preferably, the multimedia service is a multimedia<br>
broadcast/multicast service (MBMS).<br>
Preferably, the RNC is a control RNC (CRNC) that manages a<br>
common resource for multiple terminals.<br>
Preferably, the RNC includes an MBMS handling layer for outputting<br>
multimedia data to be transmitted; and a packet data convergence protocol<br>
(PDCP) layer for compressing a header of multimedia data.<br>
Preferably, the PDCP layer includes one entity for every specific<br>
multimedia service in one cell.<br>
To achieve at least these advantages in whole or in part, there is<br>
further provided a data transmission method in a wireless system for<br>
compressing a header of multimedia service data and multicasting it through<br>
a downlink, including: compressing a header of multimedia service data; and<br>
transmitting the header-compressed multimedia service data to plural<br><br>
terminals through a common transport channel.<br>
Preferably, the multimedia service is a multimedia<br>
broadcast/multicast service (MBMS),<br>
Preferably, the header compression is performed at a packet data<br>
convergence protocol (PDCP) layer, and the PDCP layer exists in a control<br>
radio network controller (CRNC).<br>
Preferably, the PDCP layer includes one entity for every specific<br>
MBMS service in one cell.<br>
Preferably, the particular network component (e.g., in a SRNC or a<br>
CRNC) that includes the PDCP layer for a specific MBMS service depends<br>
upon certain characteristics of the terminals (UE) located within a cell that<br>
wish to receive the specific MBMS service.<br>
Additional advantages, objects, and features of the invention will be<br>
set forth in part in the description which follows and in part will become<br>
apparent to those having ordinary skill in the art upon examination of the<br>
following or may be learned from practice of the invention. The objects and<br>
advantages of the invention may be realized and attained as particularly<br>

MODES FOR CARRYING OUT THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
The present invention is implemented in a mobile communication<br>
system such as a UMTS (Universal Mobile Telecommunications System)<br>
developed by 3GPP. However, the present invention can be also applied to a<br>
communication system opening in a different standard.<br>
Referring back to the related art, if MBMS data is header-<br><br>
compressed and transmitted, the number of required PDCP entities must<br>
equal the total number of terminals for every specific MBMS service to be<br>
provided. Accordingly, system resources of the UTRAN and various radio<br>
resources are wasted.<br>
In order to address such problems, in the inventors of the present<br>
invention considered the characteristics of providing MBMS, such as MBMS<br>
data being simultaneously transmitted to a plurality of terminals, and provided<br>
a solution to related art problems by providing a PDCP layer that handles<br>
header compression into the CRNC. That is, as shown in the protocol stack<br>
shown in Figure 6, the PDCP is provided above the RLC layer, which is<br>
above the MAC layer at the CRNC.<br>
In addition, in the present invention, MBMS data with a header<br>
compressed in a single PDCP layer within the CRNC, is transmitted to a<br>
terminal through the common transport channel. The common transport<br>
channel is a forward access channel (FACH) or a downlink shared channel<br>
(DSCH).<br>
Figure 7 illustrates a network structure for the transmission of the<br>
MBMS data in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.<br>
As shown in Figure 7, when the PDCP layer, which compresses a<br>
 header of MBMS data, exists at the CRNC, only one PDCP entity is required<br>
for each specific MBMS service in a cell irrespective of the number of<br>
terminals. That is, in the present invention, a radio (wireless) system is<br>
implemented such that one PDCP entity exists per cell in UTRAN for a<br><br>
specific MBMS service. Furthermore, each UE has its own PDCP entity for a<br>
specific MBMS service. Thus, for a specific MBMS service, if there are plural<br>
terminal which desires to receive the service, one PDCP entity in UTRAN is<br>
associated with plural PDCP entities that belong to the terminals.<br>
Accordingly, for transmission of MBMS data, the MBMS handling<br>
layer of CRNC transmits the MBMS data to the PDCP layer, and then, the<br>
PDCP layer compresses of a header of the received MBMS data and then<br>
transmits to a plurality of terminals, which desire to receive the specific<br>
MBMS data, through the common transport channel. Each PDCP layer of<br>
each terminal decompresses the received MBMS data and transmits it to the<br>
MBMS handling layer.<br>
Also regarding Figure 7, it can be noted that an embodiment of the<br>
present invention pertains to a method for providing multicast services in a<br>
radio communication system, the method performed by a network component,<br>
such as a radio network controller (RNC), comprises the steps of performing<br>
Internet protocol header compression to form header compressed data, and<br>
transmitting the header compressed data in a point-to-point manner and in a<br>
point-to-multipoint manner depending upon a threshold value, to one or more<br>
users of the radio communication system.<br>
Alternatively, a method for providing multicast services according to<br>
the present invention comprises the steps of performing Internet protocol<br>
header compression to form header compressed data, and transmitting the<br>
header compressed data in a point-to-multipoint manner according to a type<br><br>
of multicast service to one or more users in the radio communication system.<br>
Here, the Internet protocol header compression is respectively<br>
performed for each type of multicasting service to be provided. Also, the<br>
header compression is performed at a central location for each type of<br>
multicast service, wherein the central location is a packet data convergence<br>
protocol (PDCP) entity, and the PDCP entity is located within a controlling<br>
radio network controller (CRNC).<br>
Also, it should be noted that the header-compressed data can be<br>
selectively transmitted in a point-to-point manner, in a point-to-multipoint<br>
manner, or both. The manner of transmission depends upon the conditions of<br>
the radio communication environment. For example, the point-to-point<br>
manner is employed if a total number of users within a cell is below the<br>
threshold value, while the point-to-multipoint manner is employed if a total<br>
number of users within a cell is at or above the threshold value.<br>
The point-to-point manner is transmitting data from a single sending<br>
point to a single receiving point, which may be based upon a total number of<br>
users within a cell of the radio communication system.<br>
Preferably, the point-to-point manner is performed in a serving radio<br>
network controller (SRNC). Here, the transmitting by point-to-point manner is<br>
via a dedicated channel. In contrast, the point-to-multipoint manner is<br>
performed in a controlling radio network controller (CRNC). Here, the transmitting by point-to-multipoint manner is via a common channel.<br>
Based upon the above, it can be understood that a method for<br><br>
receiving multicast services at a user equipment (UE) can be performed with<br>
appropriate steps and procedures that oppose those steps and procedures<br>
used for providing (transmitting) the multicast service.<br>
As so far described, in the present invention, when MBMS data<br>
having point-to-muitipoint characteristics is header-compressed and<br>
transmitted, the PDCP layer for the MBMS is positioned at the CRNC, so that<br>
one PDCP entity exists for every specific MBMS service in a cell. In addition,<br>
the MBMS data with a header compressed in one PDCP entity is transmitted<br>
to the terminal through the common transport channel.<br>
Accordingly, adopting the PDCP structure and the transmission<br>
method of the present invention resolves the problems of the related art in<br>
which the PDCP entities are repetitively provided for every specific MBMS<br>
service in a cell, each PDCP being provided in the SRNC and transmitted via<br>
a dedicated transport channel. Thus, waste of system resources of the<br>
UTRAN and radio resources can be prevented and transmission efficiency<br>
can be improved.<br>
It should be noted that the particular network component (e.g., in a<br>
SRNC or a CRNC) that includes the PDCP layer for a specific MBMS service<br>
depends upon certain characteristics of the terminals (UE) located within a<br>
cell that wish to receive the specific MBMS service. For example, the<br>
characteristic of the terminals (UE) may be the total number of terminals (UE)<br>
wishing to receive the specific MBMS service. Namely, if the total number of<br>
terminals is equal to or greater than a threshold value, header compression is<br><br>
performed (at the PDCP layer) in a CRNC that manages shared resources<br>
within a cell, and downlink data transmission via a common transport channel<br>
is performed. If the total number is less than the threshold, header<br>
compression is performed (at the PDCP layer) in a SRNC that manages<br>
dedicated resources, and downlink data transmission via a dedicated<br>
transport channel is performed.<br>
Thus, depending upon the total number of terminals within a cell, a<br>
terminal can receive via a common transport channel and restores (i.e.,<br>
decompresses) the header-compressed data of the MBMS service that was<br>
transmitted after header compression at the CRNC, while a terminal can<br>
receive via a dedicated transport channel and restores (i.e., decompresses)<br>
the header-compressed data of the MBMS service that was transmitted after<br>
header compression at the SRNC.<br>
Here, it can be understood that other characteristics, besides the<br>
total number of terminals may also be employed as needed.<br>
The foregoing embodiments and advantages are merely exemplary<br>
and are not to be construed as limiting the present invention. The present<br>
teaching can be readily applied to other types of apparatuses. The<br>
description of the present invention is intended to be illustrative, and not to<br>
limit the scope of the claims. Many alternatives, modifications, and variations<br>
will be apparent to those skilled in the art.<br><br>
