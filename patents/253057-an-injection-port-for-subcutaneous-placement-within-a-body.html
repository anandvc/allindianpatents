				<td>Field of the Invention<br>
This invention relates generally to the field of medicine, and more specifically to<br>
medical devices. More particularly, the invention relates to an injection port for<br>
subcutaneous placement within a body.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
Surgeons routinely implant subcutaneous injection ports in patients requiring<br>
long term, periodic fluid injections such as for chemotherapy and gastric band<br>
adjustments. The injection port connects to a flexible tube catheter to transport<br>
the fluid to the affected area (subclavian vein, etc.) or the gastric band. Current<br>
injection ports comprise a rigid metal or plastic housing, which is about 25mm in<br>
diameter and 15mm tall. A thick, silicone septum captured within the rigid<br>
housing covers an inner chamber that fluidly communicates with the catheter.<br>
The surgeon uses a hypodermic needle to inject fluid into the chamber through<br>
the silicone septum.<br>
Typically the surgeon fastens the injection port with suture to fascia and beneath<br>
the fat and skin layers, primarily to prevent the port from flipping over, but also<br>
to prevent the injection port from migrating in the body. Since the septum is<br>
accessible from only one side of the injection port, flipping over requires<br>
interventional surgery to right the port for subsequent injections.<br><br><br>
For some patients, the surgeon may place the injection port in the lower<br>
abdomen, thus burying the port beneath a fat layer that may be several<br>
centimeters thick. Usually a surgeon can locate the port with palpation alone.<br>
However, if there is a very thick, intervening fat layer, such as on extremely<br>
obese, gastric band patients, the surgeon must also use fluoroscopy, ultrasound,<br>
or other means to locate the port. Furthermore, the surgeon must inject the<br>
needle in a direction approximately perpendicular to the injection port, and hit<br>
the target area of the septum, which is only about 12-15mm in diameter. For<br>
some patients, the<br><br>
surgeon may place the injection port on the sternum or upper right chest, just<br>
beneath the skin layers. Although easy to locate with palpation, some patients<br>
regard the protruding port as uncomfortable or cosmetically objectionable.<br>
What is needed, therefore, is a subcutaneously implantable injection port that is<br>
made of relatively soft and flexible materials, and ideally, that looks and feels<br>
more (than current injection ports) like a large, natural blood vessel. What is also<br>
needed is a subcutaneously implantable injection port that is penetrable with a<br>
hypodermic needle, independent of the orientation of the injection port in bodily<br>
tissue, and that is self-sealing when the needle is removed. What is further<br>
needed is a subcutaneously implantable injection port that a surgeon may<br>
position in the body more quickly and with less dissection than is required for<br>
conventional injection ports.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
Accordingly, there is provided An injection port for subcutaneous placement<br>
within a body comprising: an elongated flexible substantially non-rigid body<br>
having first and second ends and a wall therebetween, said wall is such that it<br>
will self seal after being punctured, said body comprising a fluid reservoir<br><br><br>
surrounded by said wall ; and a flexible elongated tubular catheter attached to<br>
said body which is in fluid communication with said reservoir, characterized in<br>
that said body having a length between said ends of 5mm to 20mm, and an<br>
outer diameter of 5mm to 12mm, and in that an adjustable gastric band<br>
connected to the tube .<br>
The invention thus provides an injection port for subcutaneous placement within<br>
a body. The injection port includes an elongated flexible substantially non-rigid<br>
body having first and second ends and a wall therebetween. The wall is made<br>
from one or more materials such that it will self seal after being punctured by a<br>
needle. The body of the device further includes and a fluid reservoir surrounded<br>
by the wall. Lastly, the injection port includes a flexible elongated tubular<br>
catheter attached to the body which is in fluid communication with the reservoir.<br>

Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
Referring now to the drawings, FIGS. 1 and 2 show an injection port 10 of the prior art.<br>
Injection port 10 generally has a truncated, conical configuration, and comprises a body<br>
portion 12, a housing 14, a seal element 16, and a catheter element 18. The body portion 12<br>
is made of a flexible, rubberized material with a cavity 20 formed inside. A catheter support<br>
22 integrally forms in body portion 12. Housing 14 is made of a corrosion resistant metal,<br><br>
and has a reduced, upwardly facing entry passage 24. Seal element 16 is made of a<br>
rubberized material, which is easily penetrable by a hypodermic needle or the like, and<br>
provides a penetrable seal for passage 24. Housing 14 and seal element 16 define an open<br>
cavity 20 in injection port 10 for receiving and containing a fluid. Catheter element 18<br>
extends through catheter support 22 of body portion 12 and through housing 14 so that<br>
catheter element 18 extends into cavity 20 for providing communication between cavity 20<br>
and the exterior of injection port 10 for dispensing fluid from the cavity 20 into the body of<br>
a patient.<br>
A surgeon implants injection port 10 subcutaneously in a patient. To introduce a fluid<br>
such as a medication or a saline solution, the surgeon inserts a hypodermic needle or the like<br>
into the patient so that the tip of the needle passes through seal element 16 and into cavity<br>
20. Due to the relatively small size of passage 24, each time the surgeon introduces a fluid<br>
into the patient, the surgeon must insert the needle through seal element 16 and the same<br>
localized area of the skin and tissue of the patient. Accordingly, seal element 16 may<br>
become significantly damaged and eventually develop a leak. Also, the localized skin area<br>
and underlying tissue may not heal in the desired manner. Further, because housing 14 is<br>
made of metal, it can cause barbing of the needle tip, causing increased trauma to the patient<br>
upon withdrawal of the needle. Still further, because of the truncated conical configuration<br>
of injection port 10 and the metallic construction of housing 14, injection port 10 can cause<br>
substantial discomfort to a patient, particularly if the area of the patient adjacent the injection<br>
port is accidentally bumped or bruised. In addition, because of the truncated conical<br>
configuration of injection port 10, it can cause a relatively unattractive mound on the body<br>
of a patient. Still further, since fluid can only be introduced in cavity 20 through passage 24,<br>
a surgeon must insert a needle into injection port 10 in substantially perpendicular relation to<br>
the skin so that often the adjacent area of tissue or skin of the patient cannot effectively<br>
support the needle.<br>
When using injection port 10 of the prior art in a laparoscopic procedure such as<br>
implantation of a gastric band, it is necessary for the surgeon to assemble injection port 10 to<br>
catheter element 18 during the laparoscopic procedure. This is because injection port 10 is<br>
too large to pass through a standard size (12mm diameter) laparoscopic port, which is used<br>
for access to the stomach inside the abdominal cavity. The surgeon must introduce the<br><br>
gastric band and the catheter into the abdominal cavity without the injection port attached to<br>
the free end of the catheter. Once the surgeon has secured the gastric band around the<br>
stomach, the surgeon externalizes the free end of the catheter through the abdominal muscle<br>
and fascia layers, subcutaneous fat layer, and the skin to assemble the injection port to the<br>
free end of the catheter. Then the surgeon implants the injection port subcutaneously at the<br>
desired location on the patient's abdomen or chest. The surgeon must take extra time to<br>
assemble the injection port to the catheter. Also, the surgeon must skillfully connect the<br>
injection port to the catheter during less than ideal conditions. Consequently, there is the<br>
potential complication of an undiscovered leak developing at the connection of the catheter<br>
to the port.<br>
FIG. 3 is an isometric view of a first embodiment of the present invention showing a<br>
flexible injection port or body 30, that generally comprises a first end 34, a second end 36,<br>
and a cylindrical injection portion 32 extending there between. A surgeon may use a<br>
hypodermic needle or the like to penetrate injection portion 32 and introduce a fluid such as<br>
a medication or saline solution into flexible injection port 30. Injection portion 32 self-seals<br>
when the surgeon removes the hypodermic needle. Injection portion 32 may have a length,<br>
but is not limited to, approximately 5-20 cm. Injection portion 32 may have a diameter,<br>
but is not limited to, approximately 5-12 mm. A catheter 42 attaches to first end 34 and<br>
distributes fluid injected into flexible injection port 30 to another portion of the patient's<br>
body. Catheter 42 is made from a silicone rubber or other biocompatible polymer such as<br>
known in the art for application to conventional injection ports, such as shown in FIGs 1 and<br>
2. A tether 38 having an eye loop 40 extends from second end 36. A surgeon may use a<br>
conventional surgical grasping instrument to grasp tether 38, or a surgical suture tied to eye<br>
loop 40, or a combination of both grasper and suture, to facilitate placement of flexible<br>
injection port 30 in the body.<br>
Although flexible injection port 30 is shown in FIG. 3 to be essentially straight, it is<br>
possible to construct it with a curved or non-straight shape in order to facilitate placement in<br>
the body, or to conform to the body anatomy at the implant location. Since flexible injection<br><br>
port 30 is made of relatively soft and flexible materials, the surgeon may temporarily<br>
straighten it, for example, when introducing it into the body through a laparoscopic port.<br>
FIG. 4 is a cross sectional view of flexible injection port 30, taken at line 4-4 of injection<br>
portion 32 as shown in FIG. 3. At this location and anywhere along the length of injection<br>
portion 32, flexible injection port 30 includes an outer tube 44 may exerts a radial,<br>
compressive force on an inner tube 46. Flexible injection port 30 includes a fluid reservoir<br>
48 that extends the entire length of injection portion 32 and fluidly communicates with<br>
catheter 42. The total wall thickness is approximately in the range of 2 - 4mm.<br>
FIG. 5 is a longitudinal sectional view of flexible injection port 30, showing a<br>
hypodermic needle 100 penetrating through injection portion 32 so that distal tip 102 of<br>
hypodermic needle 100 is inside of fluid reservoir 48. First end 34, second end 36, tether<br>
38, eye loop 40, and inner tube 46 are integrally molded from an elastomer such as, for<br>
example, silicone rubber, latex rubber, or polyurethane rubber. The molded elastomer may<br>
have a durometer approximately in the range of 40-60, but is not limited to that range.<br>
Catheter 42 may be bonded inside of first end 34 using any one of a number of bonding<br>
agents and techniques well known in the art, in order to fluidly communicate with reservoir<br>
48. Outer tube 44 may be made of a PTFE shrink-wrap material, or a similar, biocompatible<br>
shrink-wrap. During the manufacturing process, outer tube 44 may be loosely assembled in<br>
the pre-shrunken configuration over inner tube 46. Then the application of heat causes outer<br>
tube 44 to conform very tightly around inner tube 46. Outer tube 44 therefore applies a<br>
significant compressive force on the softer, inner tube 46 to enhance the ability of inner tube<br>
46 to close the puncture created by hypodermic needle 100.<br>
FIG. 6 is a cross sectional view of a second embodiment of the present invention<br>
showing a flexible injection port 50, which is externally similar to the first embodiment<br>
shown in FIG. 3. Flexible injection port 50 includes an outer tube 52, an inner tube 54, and<br>
an inner lining 56. Outer tube 52 and inner tube 54 are the same as outer tube 44 and inner<br>
tube 46, respectively, of the first embodiment in FIG. 4. Inner lining 56 may be an extruded<br><br>
plastic, thin wall tube, such as polyethylene or PTFE, tightly assembled inside of inner tube<br>
54 to provide internal support to inner tube 54. By supporting inner tube 54 in this way, a<br>
greater compressive force may be applied by outer tube 52 onto inner tube 54, to further<br>
enhance the self-sealing capability. The material of inner lining 56 may be selected to have<br>
a higher needle penetration resistance than inner tube 54. This difference in penetration<br>
resistance provides the surgeon with tactile feedback that the needle tip has penetrated into<br>
fluid reservoir 58. Inner lining 56 may also be constructed of a metallic mesh and be similar<br>
in many respects to a vascular stent. Again, the total wall thickness is approximately in the<br>
range of 2-4 mm.<br>
FIG. 7 is a cross sectional view of a third embodiment of the present invention showing a<br>
flexible injection port 60, which also is externally similar to the first embodiment shown in<br>
FIG. 3. Flexible injection port 60 comprises a plurality of layers 61, which for this third<br>
embodiment includes a first layer 62, a second layer 64, a third layer 66, a fourth layer 68,<br>
and a fifth layer 70, which surrounds a fluid reservoir 72. . Once penetrated by a needle<br>
that is inserted at an acute angle, the punctures created through the layers are not aligned to<br>
allow leakage once the needle is removed. Each of layers 61 may be made of the same or a<br>
different material than any of the other of layers 61, or may have the same or a different<br>
thickness than any of the other of layers 61. Each of layers 61 may have a specific property<br>
or functional contribution. For example, first layer 62 may be made of a material that is<br>
permeable to tissue fluids in order to slowly release a medication contained in second layer<br>
64. Fifth layer 70 may be made of silicone rubber having a durometer in the range of 20 -<br>
30. Fourth layer 68 may be made of a heat shrinkable PTFE material, which applies a<br>
radially compressive force on fifth layer 70 to enhance self-sealing. Third layer 66 may be<br>
made of a material such as a metallic foil that acts as a diffusion barrier to prevent the loss of<br>
fluid from fluid reservoir 72. Fourth layer 66 may be made of a high durometer silicone<br>
rubber. Many other materials are possible, in a multiplicity of combinations, so that<br>
injection port 60 may have characteristics especially suited for its particular application.<br>
Diffusion of body fluids into and out of the soft port wall may also be reduced by any one of<br>
various material treatment techniques, including, for example, vapor deposition of titanium<br>
or another metal on a surface of the soft port, and coating with Paralene polymer. Other<br><br>
coatings are also known in the art for micro bacterial protection. Again, the total wall<br>
thickness is in the range of 2 - 4 mm.<br>
FIG. 8 is a fourth embodiment of the present invention, a flexible injection port 80,<br>
comprising a first end 84 that attaches to a catheter 92, a second end 86 and an injection<br>
portion 82. Flexible injection port 80 further comprises a webbing 88 attached to and<br>
covering at least injection portion 82, and made of a thin, flexible, implantable material such<br>
as a polyester or polypropylene mesh, expanded PTFE, or the like. Webbing 88 provides<br>
broad margins for stapling or suturing to an underlying tissue such as fascia, as well as a<br>
large area for tissue in-growth, to enhance long-term stability and to substantially prevent<br>
migration of flexible injection port 80. FIG. 9 is a cross sectional view of flexible injection<br>
port 80, taken at line 9-9 of FIG. 8. Flexible injection port 80 comprises an outer tube 94<br>
made of a heat shrinkable, PTFE material, and an inner tube 96 made of a silicone rubber<br>
having a durometer of approximately 20-40. Webbing 88 includes a pair of webbing layers,<br>
91 and 93, that may be bonded thermally or chemically tightly over at least injection portion<br>
82 in the mid-plane of flexible injection port 80.<br>
A surgeon may implant the present invention, as described for the preceding<br>
embodiments and equivalents, in a number of locations in a patient's body. FIGs 10, 11,<br>
and 12 show examples of flexible injection port 30 subcutaneously implanted in the<br>
abdomen of a patient, although it is possible to implant flexible injection port 30 beneath the<br>
skin in other portions of the body.<br>
FIG. 10 depicts a first example of flexible injection port 30 subcutaneously implanted in<br>
a patient's body. Flexible injection port 30 lies adjacent to a fascia layer 124 covering an<br>
abdominal wall 126. Catheter 42 passes from the abdominal cavity 128 through an<br>
abdominal opening 132, which the surgeon used together with a first incision 130 for<br>
laparoscopic access earlier in the surgical procedure. The surgeon optionally may make a<br>
second incision 134 offset from first incision 130, and use conventional, surgical grasping<br>
and retracting instruments to pull flexible injection port 30 beneath a fat layer 122 and<br>
adjacent to fascia layer 124. However, the surgeon may determine that it is not necessary to<br>
make a second incision 134, and instead use first incision 130 to push flexible injection port<br>
30 into position. In either situation, the surgeon dissects as little tissue as practical in order<br><br>
to save surgery time and to minimize the size of enclosed cavities that may collect tissue<br>
fluids and become sites for infection. The surgeon optionally may anchor flexible injection<br>
port 30 to fascia layer 124 with a stay suture 102. Once the surgeon has placed flexible<br>
injection port 30 in the desired location, the surgeon closes first incision 130 and second<br>
incision 134 using conventional sutures or staples.<br>
FIG. 11 shows a second example of flexible injection port 30 subcutaneously implanted<br>
in a patient's body. Flexible injection port 30 lies immediately beneath skin layer 120 and<br>
above fat layer 122. Catheter 42 passes through first incision 130 and abdominal opening<br>
132 (the original laparoscopic port site) into abdominal cavity 128. The surgeon may use<br>
finger or instrument dissection through first incision 130 to create a space under skin layer<br>
120 for flexible injection port 30. The surgeon closes first incision 130 using conventional<br>
sutures or staples. Normally it would not be necessary to close abdominal opening 132<br>
through fascia layer 124 and abdominal wall 126, but the surgeon may do so in order to<br>
promote healing and to prevent slippage of catheter 42 through abdominal opening 132.<br>
The surgeon may prefer placement of flexible injection port 30 just beneath skin layer 120<br>
for severely obese patients in which fat layer 122 is over 5-10 cm thick, so that the surgeon<br>
may easily use palpation to locate flexible injection port 30 for later injections of fluid.<br>
Also, conventional intravenous (IV) needles and techniques may be used for injecting the<br>
fluid into flexible injection port 30, which is situated beneath the skin much like a natural<br>
blood vessel. This may allow nurses and other clinicians who are trained in administering<br>
IV's to assist the surgeon with fluid injections. Furthermore, if the clinician uses a<br>
conventional IV needle, the "flashback" of fluid into the IV needle syringe tip provides the<br>
clinician with visual feedback that the tip of the needle is properly penetrated into the<br>
reservoir of flexible injection port 30. In fact, addition of a colorant to the fluid injected<br>
further enhances this visual feedback. Non-toxic colorants that may be added to the saline<br>
solution or medication are well known in the art.<br>
FIG. 12 shows a third example of flexible injection port 30 subcutaneously implanted in<br>
a patient's body. For this example, the surgeon does minimal or no dissection of tissue at<br>
the laparoscopic port site. Catheter 42 passes from the abdominal cavity 128 through fascia<br>
layer 124 and abdominal wall 126. The surgeon positions flexible injection port 30<br>
vertically in fat layer 122 and beneath skin layer 120. Optionally, the surgeon may suture<br><br>
abdominal opening 132 to prevent slippage of flexible injection port 30 into abdominal<br>
cavity 128. The surgeon also may use a surgical scissors to trim off tether 38 from flexible<br>
injection port 30, just prior to closing first incision 130 with conventional sutures or staples.<br>
The present invention, a flexible injection port, as described in the preceding<br>
embodiments and their equivalents, has numerous advantages over the prior art injection<br>
ports. The flexible injection port may not require attachment to fascia, thus reducing the<br>
duration of the surgical procedure. The flexible injection port may require a smaller incision<br>
size and less tissue dissection for implantation, so that the patient has less pain, less scarring,<br>
a faster recovery, and less possibility of infection. Due to the integral construction of the<br>
flexible injection port and the catheter, the step of connecting the catheter to the injection<br>
port during the surgical procedure is not necessary, thus potentially reducing the number of<br>
surgical complications due to fluid leakage at the connection. Because the flexible injection<br>
port may be implanted in the fat layer near the skin surface, the surgeon or a trained<br>
clinician may use palpation to locate the injection port, and standard IV techniques to<br>
administer fluid, yet the implant is still cosmetically acceptable to the patient. In addition,<br>
shorter injection needles may be used to reduce patient anxiety during fluid administration.<br>
The flexible injection port may have no metallic parts, resulting in a flexible and lightweight<br>
implant for greater patient comfort and compatibility with magnetic resonance and<br>
fluoroscopic x-ray imaging. Finally, the injection portion of the flexible injection port is<br>
accessible with a hypodermic needle for most of the possible orientations of the flexible<br>
injection port within the subcutaneous fat layer of the patient.<br>
While preferred embodiments of the present invention have been shown and<br>
described herein, it will be obvious to those skilled in the art that such embodiments are<br>
provided by way of example only. Numerous variations, changes, and substitutions will<br>
now occur to those skilled in the art without departing from the invention. For example,<br>
the injection port may me coated with an anit-microbial coating such as triclosan. For<br>
example, as would be apparent to those skilled in the art, the disclosures herein have<br>
equal application in robotic-assisted surgery. In addition, it should be understood that<br>
every structure described above has a function and such structure can be referred to as a<br>
means for performing that function. Accordingly, it is intended that the invention be<br>
limited only by the spirit and scope of the appended claims.<br><br>
