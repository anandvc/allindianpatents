PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of this invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br><br><br><br>
Technical field<br>
This invention relates to ball point pen ink compositions having ultra low viscosity of at least 500 cps preventing leakage due to formation of temporary bridging between functional groups and associative thickening.<br>
This invention also relates to a process for the preparation of ultra low viscosity ball point pen ink composition of the invention.<br>
This invention also relates to a ball point pen having high lay down tips comprising the above mentioned ink prepared according to the process of the invention which prevents leakage, hobbling, gooping, gobbling and gives pleasure in writing being smooth feel even with smaller ball dia tips.<br>
Prior Art of the Invention:<br>
A ballpoint pen is a writing instrument which features a tip that is automatically refreshed with ink. It consists of a precisely formed metal ball seated in a socket below a reservoir of ink. As the pen is moved along a writing surface, ink is delivered.<br>
A conventionally known oil-based ink for such a ballpoint pen contains coloring agent, organic solvent, resin or the like, and its ink viscosity is in a range of 10000 to 30000 mPas at 20° C. When the ink viscosity is high in the oil-based ballpoint pen, the ball rotational resistance itself at writing becomes large and the ink condition is very heavy, which is not favorable. On the contrary, when the ink viscosity is excessively lowered, the inconveniences like ink spill-out and the degradation of handwriting dryness occur. The earlier pens leaked or clogged due to improper viscosity of the ink, and depended on gravity of ink delivery to the ball. Depending upon the gravity, it caused difficulties with the flow and that it was required that the pen to be held nearly in vertical position.<br>
Further the use of high viscosity ink increases the ball rotation resistance during writing and it affects writing smoothness and fails to be satisfactory. Further, a high writing pressure is required during writing. In some cases, a load of 500 gf or more is applied to a pen point. The heavy load causes a pen point to be damaged instantly. Furthermore, ball breakage and writing defects frequently occur as a consequence.<br>
The low viscosity inks provide for a much smoother writing action and a more intense written line than the high viscosity inks. When using low viscosity inks, however, special provisions must be made to prevent leakage of the ink and/or to properly control the flow of ink during<br>
Page 2<br><br>
writing. A generally preferred form of inexpensive pens for this purpose utilizes a so called vacuum reservoir for the liquid ink in conjunction with a capillary collector that enables ink to be fed to the writing tip and also enables the reservoir to "breathe" in response to the consumption of ink and/or to changes in temperature and pressure.<br>
One of the writing defects is Blobbing that is a phenomenon in which a surplus ink during writing is accumulated in a pen point. Another defect is "Feathering" which is blurring of the ink due to absorption by paper etc.<br>
There are various Japanese Patent Application laid-open nos. 6-313143 (1994), 6-313144 (1994), 7-196972 (1995) and 9-48941 (1997) that disclose ink consisting of pseudo plasticity viscosity property in which the ink viscosity during writing is low and ink viscosity is high when writing is not performed to prevent leakage. However, the leakage is not prevented completely.<br>
Ball point pens filled with conventional inks have a viscosity of 5000 to 20000 mPa's at 25° C. Sometimes ink leak from the pen tips happen when the ball point pens have been irradiated directly with sunlight to have the temperatures of the pen bodies elevated, or when the ball point pens have been left turning downward for long time. Ball point pens filled with inks having a low viscosity of 1000 to 5000 mPa's at 25° C shows leakage from the pen tips when the ball point pens have been irradiated directly with sunlight to have the temperatures of the pen bodies elevated, or when the ball point pens have been left turning downward for long time. Increasing the drying property of inks in order to stop leaking of the inks brings about the problems of deterioration in the writing feeling, starving at the beginning of writing and reduction in the shelf life. Furthermore, ink leaking out of the pen tips of ball point pens stain hands and cloths or make it impossible to use the ball point pens in a certain case. Accordingly, it is the current situation to prevent ink from leaking by reducing clearance of tips, and thus the writing feeling tends to be deteriorated.<br>
US5942027 discloses the ink for a ball point pen which comprises at least one or plural kinds of organic solvents, colorants and resins and fine particle silica having a primary average particle diameter of 7 to 40 nm and a specific surface area (BET method) of 50 to 380 m@2 /g. The ink for a ball point pen comprises polyvinyl pyrrolidone as an additive. The ink for a ball point pen has a viscosity of 1000 to 5000 mPa's at 25° C.<br>
US6530708 discloses the ink follower composition for oil-based ballpoint pens. The ink composition comprises at least one organic solvent selected from the group consisting of a sparingly volatile organic solvent and a non-volatile organic solvent, a gelling agent comprising inorganic fine particles, and from 10 to 60% by weight of a resin soluble in the organic solvent<br>
Page 3<br><br>
used. The resin is terpene-base resins and phenol-base resins. The inorganic fine particles are fine particulate silica. However, US3425779 uses colloidal silica to prepare ink composition having viscosity of 874,000 cps at 28° C with a Number 4 cylindrical spindle at 0.3 rpm on Brookfield viscometer.<br>
JP 2003191680 discloses a ballpoint pen with which handwriting is clear and write-ability is good without bleeding, strike through and clogging, in the ballpoint pen having a ballpoint pen tip rotate-ably supporting a writing point ball in a ball holding state and filled with an oily ink. The oily ink consists of coloring agent, organic solvent, non-Newtonian viscosity imparting agent and C4 aliphatic alcohol. The non-Newtonian viscosity index is 04.to 0.9 and viscosity at a shearing speed of 500 sec"' is 500 to 5000pas at 20° C.<br>
Theoretically it has been conventionally known that the writing pleasure is inversely proportional to the viscosity of the ink , but with the lower viscosity inks the major problem known is that of leakage, hobbling, gooping, gobbling feathering through the paper etc.<br>
Apart in the known arts of stopping leakage with lower viscosity inks, it has been successfully achieved by fume silica and PVP, but as the inventors observed that probably the bonds are much stronger , which in turn compromises on smoothness when it is used with smaller ball dia.<br>
