THE PATENTS ACT, 1970 (39 of 1970)<br>
COMPLETE SPECIFICATION (See section 10; rule 13)<br><br>
"ELECTRICAL FAULT RESTRICTING SYSTEM"<br><br>
JOSHI MUKUNDBHAI MADHAVLAL An Indian National having his address at "Shri Shivam", 3, Sanskruti Bunglows, Vastrapur Sarkari Vasahat Road, Ahmedabd - 52, Gujarat State, India.<br><br><br><br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of this invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br><br>
2<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is related to the electrical fault restriction system to be used in electrical system and / or electrical equipment. The present invention is particularly related to the electrical fault restriction system by which electrical fault can be restricted from preliminary stage.<br>
It is necessary that any electrical system and / or electrical equipment must be protected from electrical fault to protect it from severe effects of electrical faults. There are various types of faults affecting the system like short circuit fault, over current fault, open circuit fault, thermal hot spot and earth fault, an arc developed due to electrical parameters of fault path at point of electrical fault such as short circuit, open circuit, thermal hot spot and earth fault.<br>
PRIOR ART<br>
There are systems available for fault restriction that work for all type of voltage class where they identify electrical fault with the help of measuring devices. These measuring devices measure electrical parameters of electrical system and/or equipment. In normal conditions, measured value of parameters indicate voltage and current of electrical system and/or equipment. Now at fault condition, measured value of parameters indicate voltage and current of system or equipment with fault. So it is very difficult to identify actual electrical parameters particularly current due to fault. Comparing the measured value with the set value of measured parameters, controlling device gives trip signal to save electrical system and/ or equipment. To avoid mal operation of electrical system and/or equipment, the set values of electrical parameters are kept at some higher level than what is required. Hence, fault is not restricted at its initial stage of development but at set value of electrical parameters of electrical system and/or equipment in present fault restricting system. It is clear when level of fault reaches at higher stage, it may damage severely to electrical system and/or equipment.<br><br>
3 <br>
Moreover, the present systems are on bases of assumptions for some type of fault hence they do not provide accurate results. These systems are less sensitive for fault.<br>
With the available systems for electrical fault protection, they are able to protect only when level of the electrical parameters in electrical system and / or electrical equipment reaches at set values of the electrical parameters. The faulty section is isolated from entire system thus entire system is saved. But the fault cannot be noticed by alarming at preliminary stage and also the location at which the fault has occurred cannot be identified. Moreover, when the fault reaches at severe stage, the faulty area can be badly affected which may result into total shut down of electrical system and / or electrical equipment.<br>
The existing systems are not able to provide any records of abnormality for further analysis, which is essential for preventive maintenance, work in electrical system and / or electrical equipment.<br>
In existing systems, abnormality in electrical system and / or electrical equipment is not identified at its preliminary stage of fault, that fault event may not be minimized near to zero level.<br>
The existing systems do not give any indication of the sensed signal in developing stage of fault and there by they are unable to prevent the further development of fault in electrical system and / or electrical equipment and may also damage to the electrical system and / or electrical equipment.<br>
The existing systems are not able to identify the location of fault. Hence it takes more time to restore the affected electrical system and / or equipment.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
So with the goal of providing the system to find the electrical fault in preliminary stage of fault, identify the location of fault and restrict the electrical fault at its origin and thereby to protect the entire electrical system and / or electrical equipment in connection with the location of interest of electrical fault in electrical system and /<br><br>
4 <br>
or electrical equipment, the inventor has proposed the electric fault restricting system.<br>
The main object of the invention is to protect electrical system and / or electrical equipment from severe damages by continuous monitoring of electrical parameters, identifying faults at preliminary stage and alarming and tripping electrical system and / or electrical equipment at preliminary stage of fault efficiently with the help of electronics circuit including microprocessor.<br>
The further object of the invention is to include facility of data history storage which provides stored data for further analysis of fault condition in electrical system and / or electrical equipment and which is essential for planning of preventive maintenance work.<br>
The further object of the invention is to reduce damages to electrical system and / or electrical equipment occurring due to electrical fault and so the surrounding electrical system and / or equipment (s) are also saved from effect of fault, which reduces damage cost and save considerable restoration time.<br>
The further object of the invention is to identify fault location easily and quickly as the system is designed with electronic circuits including microprocessor.<br>
The further object of the invention is that every sensed / measured fault abnormality is noticed, analyzed, recorded as data history, accessed for performance of electrical system and / or electrical equipment, and the electrical system and / or electrical equipment is prevented from severe effects by tripping at preliminary stage of fault.<br>
The further object of the invention is to provide plurality of monitoring unit in the system to sense / measure the fault signal at preliminary stage of fault and gives location of fault and there by each unit monitors abnormality and transmits fault signal with reference to related location for further actions.<br><br>
