				<td>CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION<br>
This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/210,618, filed June 9, 2000.<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
 this invention relates to a method of minor us reser substrates having a coating grose walod of sulse-la<br>
comprising biodegradable polyhydroxyalkanoate copolymers.	<br>
BACKGROUND ART	<br>
Polymers find uses in a variety of plastic articles including films, sheets, fibers, foams, molded articles, adhesives and many other specialty products. The majority of this plastic material ends up in the solid waste stream. While some efforts at recycling have been made, repeated processing of even pure polymers results in degradation of material and consequently poor mechanical properties. Different grades of chemically similar plastics mixed upon collection can cause processing problems that make the reclaimed material inferior or unusable. Thus, there is a need for plastics, including plastic coatings, which are biodegradable.<br>
Items such as juice boxes or foil food containers often are formed with laminates of plastics or foil. As such laminates often comprises non-biodegradable matters, these items must be removed from the stream of food waste and deposited in landfills. Thus, there is a need for coatings which are biodegradable and yet resistance to grease and water. Additionally, glossy finishes are often desired on paper products, such as printing or wrapping paper. Thus, there is a need for coatings which are biodegradable and yet provide a glossy finish to paper.<br>

paper, each ply having an interface coated with a layer of water-based acrylic polymer having a low glass transition temperature and an outer face coated with a water-based acrylic polymer having a relatively high glass transition temperature, the superposed plies being sealed together in a pre-determined sealing pattern by heat and pressure which brings about fusion of the inner layer. Di Mino teaches each ply may be composed of two sheets of paper which are laminated with a water-based acrylic adhesive.

Unfortunately, many prior art plastic items comprise plasticizers. Additionally, many prior service items paper or plastic bags are lacking in strength or have poor water permeation resistance and/or grease permeation resistance. Further, many biodegradable plastic items are brittle, or are incapable of degrading under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions.<br>
Additionally, prior art polymers such as polyhydroxybutyrate and polyhydroxy-butyrate-co-valerate often have unsatisfactory properties. Polyhydroxybutyrate and polyhydroxybutyrate-co-hydroxyvalerate tends to become thermally unstable near their melt temperatures which make processing difficult. It is preferred that the melting temperature of a biodegradable material be substantially lower that its decomposition temperature, or the temperature at which molecular weight substantially decreases due to hydrolysis.<br>
There is a need for polymers which are strong without being brittle, which are easy to process and which will biodegrade under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Further, there is a need for coatings which improve the water and grease resistance of paper and fabric, and will can impart a gloss to paper.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
As used herein, "PHA" refers to a polyhydroxyalkanoate polymer of the present invention. Applicants have found that compositions comprising polyhydroxyalkanoate polymers (PHAs) provide useful coatings for substrates such as paper, fabric, thread and yarn. PHAs in accordance with the present invention will biodegrade under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions, thus, items formed from the PHAs can biodegrade even when under water. The PHAs may be disposed of into the food waste stream as a mixture of food waste and PHAs, for example, food waste and paper substrates having a coating<br>
comprising PHA may be composted together. Biodegradation of the PHAs will occur without harm to the environment, microorganisms or animals.<br>
Biodegradable items in accordance with the invention are unexpectantly resistant to liquids and grease. The items are formed from PHAs exhibit surprisingly good heat-sealability and adhesion to paper substrates.<br>
Further, unlike the homopolymer poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) (PHB) or the copolymer poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate) (PHBV), PHAs in accordance with the invention are tough without being brittle. Thus items comprising the PHAs are less likely to crack or delaminate. Applicants have found that polyhydroxyalkanoates in accordance with the present invention have lower melt temperatures, lower degrees of crystalinity and improved melt rheologies relative to polyhydroxybutyrate and poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate). As the PHAs of the present invention have low melting temperatures, the PHAs can be processed into films and coatings. The PHAs of the present invention have melting temperatures lower than their decomposition temperatures, or the temperature at which substantial MW loss due to hydrolysis occurs.<br>
As used herein, the term "coating" is intended to refer to both a layer exclusively on the surface of a substrate as well as a layer which to some degree penetrates the substrate. Suitable substrates include paper, fabric, thread and yarn. Often the substrate will be paper. As used herein, "paper" refers to a substrate formed from cellulose fiber, including paper and cardboard. As used herein, "fabric" includes natural and synthetic fabrics. The fabrics may be knitted, woven or non-woven. Suitable fabrics include cotton, rayon, woool, and polyesters, as well as biodegradable fabrics comprising PHAs. As used herein, "thread and yarn" includes natural and synthetic threads and yarns, such as cotton, rayon, polyester, wool, silk, nylon, and acrylic as well as biodegradable • threads and yarns comprising PHAs. Thread and yarn may be formed using fibers of PHA. As used herein, "fiber" refers to a flexible, macroscopically homogeneous body having a high length-to-width ratio and a small cross section.<br>
A coating comprising PHA improves the water and grease resistance substrates, and provides the substrate with a smoother surface. The coating may be applied to one or two sides of a substrate such as paper or fabric.<br>
Coated paper may be used as backing for tape; preferably the tape comprises paper, a coating comprising PHA and an adhesive, preferably an adhesive comprising PHA.<br>
Fabric and paper coated with PHA can be used to form items with improved water and grease resistance, such as wrapping paper, paper bags, plastic bags, cardboard containers, drink boxes, trays, table clothes, napkins, rain coats and ponchos, and<br>
disposable garments such as surgical scrubs. Thread and yarn coated with PHA have a smoother surface than untreated thread or yarn, and are less likely to tangle. Disposable garment seams may be sewn with thread, preferably a PHA-coated thread, or may be joined with an adhesive, preferably a biodegradable adhesive comprising a PHA.<br>
As used herein, "RRMU" refers to a randomly repeating monomer unit and "RRMUs" refers to randomly repeating monomer units. As used herein, "alkyl" refers to a saturated carbon-containing chain which may be straight or branched, and substituted (mono- or poly-) or unsubstituted, while, "alkenyl" refers to a carbon-containing chain which may be mono-unsaturated (i.e., one double bond in the chain) or poly-unsaturated (i.e., two or mor double bonds in the chain), straight or branched, and substituted (mono-or poly-) or unsubstituted.<br>
As used herein, "biodegradable" refers to the ability of a compound to ultimately be degraded completely into CH4, CO2 and water or biomass by microorganisms and/or natural environmental factors.<br>
As used herein, "compostable" refers to a material that meets the following three requirements: (1) the material is capable of being processed in a composting facility for solid waste; (2) if so processed, the material will end up in the final compost; and (3) if the compost is used in the soil, the material will ultimately biodegrade in the soil.<br>
For example, a polymer film material present in solid waste submitted to a composting facility for processing does not necessarily end up in the final compost. Certain composting facilities subject the solid waste stream to air classification prior to further processing, in order to separate paper and other materials. A polymer film would most probably be separated from the solid waste stream in such an air classification and therefore not be processed in the composting facility. Nevertheless, it may still be a "compostable" material according to the above definition because it is "capable" of being processed in a composting facility.<br>
The requirement that the material ends up in the final compost typically means that it undergoes a form of degradation in the composting process. Typically, the solid waste stream will be subjected to a shredding step in an early phase of the composting process. As a result, the polymer film will be present as shreds rather than a sheet. In the final phase of the composting process, the finished compost will be subjected to a screening step. Typically, the polymer shreds will not pass through the screens if they have retained the size they had immediately after the shredding step. The compostable materials of the present invention will have lost enough of their integrity during the composting process to allow partially degraded shreds to pass through the screens. However, it is conceivable that a composting facility might subject the solid waste stream<br>
to a very rigorous shredding and a rather coarse screening, in which case nondegradable polymers like polyethylene would meet requirement (2). Therefore, meeting requirement (2) is not enough for a material to be compostable within the present definition.<br>
What distinguishes the compostable material as defined herein from material like polyethylene is requirement (3), that the material ultimately biodegrade in the soil. This biodegradability requirement is not essential to the composting process or the use of composting soil. Solid waste and the compost resulting therefrom may contain all kinds of nonbiodegradable materials, for example, sand. However, to avoid a build up of man-made materials in the soil, it is required herein that such materials be fully biodegradable. By the same token, it is not at all necessary that this biodegradation be fast. As long as the material itself and intermediate decomposition products are not toxic or otherwise harmful to the soil or crops, it is fully acceptable that their biodegradation takes several months or even years, since this requirement is present only to avoid an accumulation of man-made material in the soil.<br>
All copolymer composition ratios recited herein refer to molar ratios, unless specifically indicated otherwise. All percentages and parts are by weight, unless specifically indicated otherwise.<br>
The polyhydroxyalkanoates used in the present invention made be synthetically prepared, or may be produced by a variety of biological organisms, such as bacteria or algae. The polyhydroxyalkanoates may be atactic, isotactic or syndiotactic. The polyhydroxyalkanoates used herein are preferably substantially isotactic (from about 90% to about 100%, by weight, isotactic) or fully isotactic (about 100%, by weight, isotactic). The fully isotactic polyhydroxyalkanoates may be obtained from biological organisms, preferably polyhydroxyalkanoates used herein are obtained from biological organisms.<br>

The coatings may serve as barriers, decorative coatings, or for other purposes. Coating may be used to apply adhesive for laminating one web to another or for manufacturing of pressure-sensitive tapes and labels. It also may be used for saturation of a porous web substrate, such as paper, in order to improve its resistance to moisture or grease penetration, or to improve its strength.<br>
The thickness of a coating is generally measured in "mils". One mil is equal to 0.001 inch. The substrates generally have a coating up to 5, preferably from about 4 to about 0.5, more preferably from about 2 to about 1 , mils thick.

The coatings herein may be formed from a composition comprising the biodegradable polyalkanoate copolymer and colorant. Alternatively, colors and designs may be printed on the items after manufacture. Preferably the colorants are non-toxic. Some items, such as garbage bags, may have coatings comprising deodorants, fragrances or disinfectants.<br>
Many plastic items comprise plasticizers such as phthalate plasticizers or adipic acid derivatives such as di-2 ethyl hexyl adipate. Phthalate plasticizers refer to compounds comprising a phthalate group used as plasticizers. Such plasticizers include bis-2-ethylhexyl phthalate, also referred to as dioctyl phthalate (DOP) and di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP), and diisononyl phthalate (DEStP). Other phthalate plasticizers include butyl benzyl phthalate, butyl octyl phthalate, di-n-butyl phthalate, dicapryl phthalate, dicyclohexyl phthalate, diethyl phthalate, dihexyl phthalate, diisobutyl phthalate, diisodecyl phthalate, diisohectyl phthalate, diisooctyl phthalate, dimethyl phthalate, ditridecyl phthalate, diundecyl phthalate, undecyl dodecyl phthalate and mixtures thereof.<br>

In one embodiment the coating comprises a polyhydroxyalkanoate in accordance with the invention, triacetin, and polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB), in a weight ratio of from about 50% to 95% PHA, 45% to 4% triaretin, 5% to 1% PHB, more preferred 70-92% PHA, 26 to 7% plasticizer, 4% to 1% PHB. Most preferred about 85:13:2 PHA:plastizer:PHB. Suitable polyhydroxyalkanoates include poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyhexanoate) (PHB-Hx) and poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyoctanoate) (PHB-O).<br><br>
In one embodiment of the invention, coated substrates comprise a coating comprising a biodegradable polyhydroxyalkanoate comprising at least two randomly repeating monomer units. In one embodiment the PHA comprises a first randomly repeating monomer unit having the structure:<br>
(Structure Removed)<br>
wherein R1 is H or a C1-2 alkyl, and n is 1 or 2; and a second randomly repeating<br>
monomer unit having the structure:<br>
(Structure Removed)<br>
wherein R2 is a C3-19 alkyl or a C3-19 alkenyl, preferably a C4-19 alkyl or a C4-19 alkenyl.<br>
In another embodiment the polyhydroxyalkanoate comprises a third randomly repeating monomer unit having the structure:<br>
(Structure Removed)<br>
wherein R3 is H, a C1-19 alkyl or a C1-19 alkenyl, and m is 1 or 2, and the third RRMU is not the same as the first RRMU or the second RRMU. Polyhydroxyalkanoate copolymers comprising three RRMUs will generally comprise, by weight, at least about 50% of the first RRMU, and generally no greater than about 20% of the third RRMU. The composition may comprise at least about 4%, more preferably at least about 5%, and even more preferably at least about 8%, and no more than about 15%, preferably no more than about 12%, more preferably no more than about 10%, by weight, of the third RRMU. The preferred levels of monomers is dependent upon the desired characteristic of the article, for example, when using a rigid substrate, such as paper, a thicker or stiffer coating may be desired than when using a flexible substrate, such as fabric.<br>
The PHAs used as coatings preferably comprise a first RRMU having formula (i) above, and a second RRMU having formula (ii) above. Preferably the weight average of molecular weight of the copolymer is greater than 50,000, preferably greater than about 100,000. In one embodiment the PHAs used as coatings comprise from about 4% to about 20%, preferably at least about 5%, by weight of total PHA, of the third RRMU having the formula (iii) above.<br>
Coated articles may be formed using any conventional coating techniques or coating equipment. Coating techniques include extrusion coating, roller coating, brush coating, dip coating, spray coating, electrostatic coating, centrifugal coating and cast coating. Articles may be coated with melted PHA, and then exposed to a coolant, such as water, by any acceptable method, such as dipping or spraying. Substrates may be laminated with a sheet or film comprising PHA, such as a solution cast film or a melt pressed film. Slurries, suspensions or solutions comprising PHA may be applied to a substrate, and the substrate then allowed to dry and, optionally, pressed.<br>
Coatings applied in a non-solid form must be sufficiently fluid to be spread into a uniformly thin layer across the substrate. Therefore, coatings are applied as solutions in organic solvents, as aqueous solutions or emulsions, as a hot melt (solid molten or softened by heat), or as a reactive liquid that solidifies by a polymerization reaction induced either thermally or by radiation. Extrusion coating, is similar to hot-melt coating.<br>
In extrusion coating, a film of molten polymer is deposited between two moving webs in a nip created by a rubber pressure roll and a chrome-plated steel chill roll. In this continuous operation, rolls of material are unwound, new rolls are automatically spliced on the fly, and the surface of the substrate is prepared by chemical priming or other surface treatment to make it receptive to the extrusion coating, and to help develop adhesion between the two materials.<br>
Coatings may be applied directly to the substrate, or may be cast to another surface, dried, and later transferred to the substrate. This transfer coating process is used for manufacturing of, for example, pressure-sensitive label stock: the adhesive is first applied to a silicone-coated release liner, dried, and then laminated to the label face stock. Coatings may be applied to the web material wound in rolls, or to precut sheets. Items such as disposable plates and trays may be formed by pressing coated paperboard blanks between forming dies, as disclosed in Shanton, U. S. Patent No. 5,776,619, incorporated herein by reference.<br>
In one embodiment, films or sheets comprising a PHA are used to laminate a substrate, such as paper. As used herein, "film" means an extremely thin continuous piece of a substance having a high length to thickness ratio and a high width to thickness<br>
ratio. While there is no requirement for a precise upper limit of thickness, a preferred upper limit is about 0.254 mm, more preferably about 0.10 mm, and even more preferably about 0.05 mm. As used herein, "sheet" means a very thin continuous piece of a substance, having a high length to thickness ratio and a high width to thickness ratio, wherein the material is thicker than about 0.254 mm. Sheeting shares many of the same characteristics as film in terms of properties and manufacture, with the exception that sheeting is stiffer, and has a self-supporting nature.<br>
Articles comprising PHAs, such as sheets and films, may be made by any art-recognized process, such as those disclosed in Noda, U. S. Patent Nos. 5,618,885 and 5,602,227, incorporated herein by reference. For example, films may be processed using conventional procedures for producing single or multilayer films on conventional film-making equipment. Sheets may be thermoformed. As used here, "mermoforrning" refers to a process by which planks or sheets of the polyhydroxyalkanote are heated until flexible and then stamped or vacuum pulled into the proper shape. Generally a sheet is fed through an oven and heated to bring it to a thermoforrnable temperature. The sheet is heated to a softening point and then advanced to a forming station. Alternatively, a sheet may move directly from an extruder to a forming station by means of a series of rolls, which can either be heated or cooled to bring the sheet to the proper thennoforming temperature. The forming station comprises molds or stamps of the desired shapes.<br>
Several preferred embodiments are illustrated in the following non-limiting examples.<br>

A slurry of poly(hydroxybutrate-co-hydroxyhexanoate) (PHB-Hx) was prepared by adding approximately 20g PHB-Hx (11.1% in powder form with 100g of ice in a Waring blender. The mixture was stirred for 20 minutes in a Waring blender at its maximum rpm. The resultant pulverized powder of PHA is mixed into water in at about 25% weight PHA, and the slurry is deposited on a sheet of paper (George pacific DP white). A small frame of 1 inch wide by 4 inches long by % inch deep is placed on the paper and the slurry is poured into the frame. After the slurry is dried, the powder PHA coating on the paper is fixed by placing the sheet of paper between release paper sheets and inserting the assembly into a laminator (Idesco) operating at 85 °C. The coated segment of paper can be printed on by placing the sheets in a Xerox 5750 laser printer and printing a test pattern on the coated part. The toner is fused securely to the coating.

The dish is placed in a oven, an the solvent is allowed to evaporate slowly overnight (10-12 hours) to produce a transparent film. The film has a nominal thickness of l-2mil. The film sheet is placed on top of a 5 inch square section of untreated cotton fabric. The assembly is placed between release paper (Idesco) and placed into a Carver Press preheated to 100 C.   The fabric / PHA assembly is pressed for 20 seconds at 1000 lbs.   The resulting coated fabric is then removed from the press and allowed to cool.   The fabric is then subjected to the following test to check for grease resistance and water resistance. About<br>
20 ml of canola oil is placed on the PHA coated side of the fabric and allowed to remain for 1 hour. The fabric is free of oil stains that would indicate penetration of the oil. About 20 ml of tap water is placed on the PHA coated side of the fabric and allowed to remain for 1 hour. The fabric is free of darkening that would indicate penetration of the water.<br>
Example 10. Fabric laminated with a layer of poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyhexanoate) polymer produced from melt pressed film.<br>
A film   of poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyhexanoate)   11.1%  hexanoate (PHB-Hx-11.1%) is prepared by placing 5 g of powder of the PHB-Hx between two Teflon sheets then inserting this in a Carver press preheated to 140 C.  The PHB-Hx is pressed at approximately 7,000 lb. force for 2 minutes. The PHB-Hx is removed from the press and allowed to cool. The PHB-Hx is now in the form of a film sheet of about 3 mil thickness. The film sheet is placed on top of a 5 inch square section of untreated cotton fabric. The assembly is placed between release paper (Idesco) and placed into a Carver Press preheated to 100°C. The fabric / PHA assembly is pressed for 20 seconds at 1000 lbs. The resulting coated fabric is then removed from the press and allowed to cool. The fabric is then subjected to the following test to check for grease resistance and water resistance. About 20 ml of canola oil is placed on the PHA coated side of the fabric and allowed to remain for 1 hour. The fabric is free of oil stains that would indicate penetration of the oil. About 20 ml of tap water is placed on the PHA coated side of the fabric and allowed to remain for 1 hour. The fabric is free of darkening that would indicate penetration of the water.<br>
