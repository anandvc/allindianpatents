				<td>The invention relates to a solar lamp for outdoor use with the characteristics of the generic part of Claim 1.<br>
Known hi prior art are solar lamps for outdoor use, in particular garden lamps, consisting of one or more solar module, and a housing with a storage means for electric energy (battery), which is electrically connected to the solar module, and one or more luminous bodies, whereby between the battery and the luminous body a circuit is provided which reacts to signals from a light sensor attached to the solar lamp and enables or disables the electrical connection between the battery and the luminous body, depending on the degree of brightness/darkness. One version, which is marketed under the name of "Pagoda" ["Pagode"], consists of a post to be inserted into the ground, which on the top is provided with a cylindrical housing into which the luminous body, battery, circuit and sensors are integrated and which is covered by a disc-shaped horizontal solar module. Another version called "Solite" is also provided with a disc-shaped upper end with a solar module, but is covered by a transparent dome. It is also known in prior art to design street lamps as solar lamps, whereby in one version, a plate-shaped elongated solar module itself serves as the largest component of the post. Other solutions have lines of lamps leading to external solar modules, since the power of the modules arranged on the plate-shaped ends of the garden<br><br>
lamps is inadequate since — for design reasons and practical considerations — the use of small modules is preferred.<br>
It is the object of the present invention to create a solar lamp, in which energy generation is optimized and which still allows for an aesthetically pleasing design..<br>
This object is achieved with the characteristics named in the generic part of Claim 1. Further developments and advantageous embodiments of the invention are described in the subclaims.<br>
According to the invention is a solar lamp for outdoor use, in particular a garden lamp, road or street lamp or such, consisting of one or more solar modules, and a housing with a storage means for electric energy (battery), which is electrically connected to the solar module, and one or more luminous bodies, whereby between the battery and the luminous body a circuit is provided* which reacts to signals from a light sensor attached to the solar lamp, and which enables or disables the electrical connection between the battery and the luminous body, depending on the degree of brightness/darkness, characterized in that the housing is provided with at least two walls of different orientation and which do not converge parallel to each other, and that one or more solar modules are arranged on each wall, or that the walls are formed by solar modules.<br>
This basic idea deviates from the "conventional wisdom" about the orientation of solar modules, according to which a southern exposure is suggested to allow a maximum incidence of solar light. Instead, two modules with different orientations are suggested, whereby it is found,<br><br>
however, that the sum of the energy obtained is increased to such an extent that it is possible to achieve a satisfactory illumination with a relatively small lamp design.<br>
Preferably, the housing is a regular body (n-hedron) with at least four wall surfaces. According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, it is a cube arranged so that it stands on an apex on a fastening, whereby the solar modules are arranged on two or more of its upper surfaces or form these surfaces. Preferably, the fastening is arranged in the region of the lower apex of the cube, and it may form either a vertical post or a horizontal arm.<br>
According to a special embodiment of the invention, there is also a motion sensor connected with electrical control means, whereby the luminous body is provided with two or more controllable brightness levels, and the higher brightness level is turned on in reaction to a signal of the motion sensor, whereby a timer is provided which limits this on period.<br>
According to an advantageous embodiment of the invention, the luminous body consists of a plurality of light emitting diodes (LEDs).<br>
The invention is described in detail below, using an example, and with reference to a drawing, where<br>
Fig. 1	shows a solar lamp 1, consisting of a cubic housing 2 and a<br>
pole 3. A lower apex of cubic housing 2 sits on the upper end of pole 3 where it is fastened to same Pole 3 is inserted in conventional fashion in the ground 4, for example in the earth. This renders the configuration of cubic housing 2 such that three wall surfaces 2 a, 2<br><br>
b, 2 c are slanted toward the top, while the other tliree wall surfaces 2 a, 2 b, 2 c are slanted toward the bottom. The upper surfaces 2 a, 2 b, 2 c are formed by solar modules 5, of which only that of module 5 is indicated here. The solar modules are glass plates with series-connected solar cells and a frame, whereby the modules are connected to their frames in such a way that they produce a cubic shape. The lower wall surfaces 2 d, 2 e, 2 fare transparent and can be formed, for example, by equal, glass plates which have no solar cells and are provided with frames, by which they are connected to each other and to the solar modules. The solar modules are provided with connections from which cables 6 lead to a module 7 in the interior of housing 2, which is provided with the above described circuits and the battery. A luminous body 8 is arranged on module 7. A sensor 9 for light and motion is arranged in pole 3, from which the corresponding lines run to module 7. When all the upper suifaces 2 a, 2 b, 2 c are fonned by solar modules, or when they carry solar modules, the cubic shape of housing 2 ensures that an optimal use of solar energy is always guaranteed without the owner having to worry about the orientation of the solar modules.<br><br><br>
WE CLAIM :<br>
1.	A solar lamp for outdoor use, in particular a garden lamp, road or street<br>
lamp, comprising one or more solar modules, and a housing with a battery,<br>
which is electrically connected to the at least one solar module, and one or more<br>
luminous bodies, a circuit being provided between the battery and the luminous<br>
body which reacts to signals from a light sensor attached to the solar lamp and<br>
which enables or disables the electrical connection between the battery and the<br>
at least one luminous body, depending on the degree of brightness/darkness,<br>
characterized in that the housing is a cube with six wall surfaces, that one or<br>
more solar modules (5) are arranged on at least two wall surfaces of the cube, or<br>
that at least two wall surfaces of the cube are formed by solar modules<br>
themselves; that the cube stands on its apex the cube is attached to a fastening<br>
structure for supporting the cube above the floor or ground and the fastening<br>
structure is attached to the cube in the area of the lower apex of the cube, and<br>
that the solar modules (5) are arranged on two or more top surfaces (2a, 2b, 2c)<br>
of the cube or the solar modules (5) and form the at least two wall surfaces of<br>
the cube.<br>
2.	The solar lamp as claimed in claim 1 wherein the fastening structure for<br>
the cube comprises one of a vertical pole (3) or a horizontal arm.<br><br>
3. The solar lamp as claimed in claim 1 wherein it comprises: a motion sensor which is connected to electrical control means, the luminous body having two or more controllable brightness levels, and the higher brightness level is turned on in reaction to a signal from the motion sensor, and a timer is provided which limits the period that the higher brightness level is turned on.<br><br></td>
