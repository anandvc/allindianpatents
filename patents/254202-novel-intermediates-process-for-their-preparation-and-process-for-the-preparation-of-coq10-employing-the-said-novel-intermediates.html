(Section 10) NOVEL INTERMEDIATES, PROCESS FOR THEIR PREPARATION AND PROCESS FOR THE PREPARATION OF CoQ10 EMPLOYING THE SAID NOVEL INTERMEDIATES<br>
NICHOLAS PIRAMAL INDIA LTD., A COMPANY REGISTERED UNDER INDIAN COMPANY'S ACT 1956, LOCATED AT, NICHOLAS PIRAMAL TOWER, GANPATRAO KADAM MARG, LOWER PAREL, MUMBAI- 400013, MAHARASHTRA, INDIA.<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of this invention and the manner in which it is to be performed<br><br>
Field of Invention<br>
The present invention relates to an improved process for the preparation of Coenzyme Q. Coenzyme Q10 or CoQ10 has the chemical name 2- [(all -trans)- 3, 7,11,15,19,23,27,3l,35,39-decamethyl-2, 6, 10, 14, 18, 22, 26, 30, 34, 38 -tetracontadecaenyl]-5,6-dimethoxy -3- methyl -1,4-benzoquinone and has the formula 1.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
The invention also provides new intermediates useful for the preparation of CoQ10 and processes for their preparation.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
This coenzyme is present in virtually in every cell in the human body and is known as the "miracle nutrient". It plays a vital role in maintaining human health and vigor and is involved in mitochondrial processes such as respiration, maintenance of heart muscle strength, enhancement of the immune system, quenching of free radical in the battle against ageing to name a few ("The miracle nutrient coenzyme" Elsvier/ North -Holland Biomedical Press, New York, 1986; "Coenzyme Q: Bioechemistry, Bioenergetics, and clinical Applications of Ubiquinone" Wiley, New York, 1985; " Coenzyme Q, Molecular Mechanism in Health and Disease" CRC press). As depicted above CoQ10 of the formula 1 comprises mainly of two moieties (i) the head group - "benzoquinone nucleus" and (ii) the "polyprenyl side chain" with ten isoprene units. The source of benzoquinone nucleus is 2,3 dimethoxy 5 methyl benzoquinone, CoQ10,of the formula 2.<br><br>
O <br><br><br>
The source of the polyprenyl side chain is solanesol, a naturally occurring alcohol, containing nine isoprene units and having the formula 3. The key step in the synthesis of CoQ10 is in the addition of the remaining isoprene unit.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
One of the processes given in literature for the addition of the remaining isoprene unit is to modify isoprene compound of formula 4 to an active building block of "chloroisoprenyl sulphone " compound of formula 5.<br><br><br><br><br>
Literature method of synthesis of chloroisoprenyl sulphone compound of formula 5 is by heating isoprene of formula 4 (0.0846 mmols), benzene sulphonyl chloride (0.086 mmols), cuprous chloride (0.846 mmols) and triethyl amine hydrochloride (0.086 mmols) in acetonitrile (0.079 mols), at reflux temperature for 2 hours and quenching in cold methanol. The crude product of formula 5 was recrystallized from 95% ethanol to obtain compound 5 in 42% yield (J. Org. Chem. 35,4217(1970).<br>
We observed that following the above procedure the reaction does not go to completion under the above condition and results in poor yield (30-40%) of the crude product. In another method, benzenesulphonyl chloride (50 mmol), isoprene (100 mmol), cuprous chloride (2.5 mmol) and triethylamine hydrochloride (2.5 mmol), were heated to 60 C for 15 hours, cooled and quenched in methylene dichloride. The compound of formula 5 was isolated by distilling out solvent and crystallizing in 95% ethanol in 90% yield (J. Org. Chem. 68, 7925(2003)).<br>
Both the process do not mention about the positional isomers of compound of formula 5a and cis isomer of compound of formula 5b, that are formed during the synthesis (J. Org. Chem. 41 3287(1976)).<br><br><br>
5a<br><br>
5b<br><br>
As reported in J.Org.Chem.41 3287 (1976), total yield of 95% is obtained for the<br>
mixture of all the three compounds of formula 5, 5a and 5b respectively. Mixture of 5<br>
and 5a in the ratio of 4:1 is obtained in 74 % yield. Purification of the desired<br>
compound 5 from the crude is obtained with drastic yield loss in 33.5 % yield only (J.<br>
Org. Chem. 41 3287(1976)).<br>
Thus an industrially economical process in which the formation of the unwanted<br>
isomers is minimized is presently lacking.<br>
Chloroisoprenyl sulphone compound of formula 5 is reacted with "benzoquinone<br>
nucleus" compound of formula 6 where R is protecting group to form CoQi sulphone<br>
of formula 7. Compound of formula 6 is made from CoQ o compound of formula 2 in<br>
three steps.<br>
Choice of protecting group is a major contributing factor in the synthesis of CoQ 10.<br>
The   protecting   groups   used   in   literature   for   the   synthesis   of  CoQ 10  using<br>
chloroisoprenyl sulphone of formula 6     are    -CH 2OCH2 CH 2OCH 3 and -CH3<br>
respectively.<br><br><br><br>
CoQl sulphone compound of formula 2 is reacted with solanesyl bromide to form CoQ 10 sulphone, compound of formula 8, which is desulphonated to form compound of formula 9 followed by deprotection and oxidation to form CoQ 10 of formula L<br><br><br><br>

Desulphonation of compound of formula 8 where R is -CH2OCH2CH2OCH3 or -CH3<br>
uses modified Bouvelut-Blanc method of sodium and ethanol and THF as solvent, at<br>
10-12°C.<br>
Deprotection involves (i) 48% hydrobromic acid at 50°C, (ii) Methanolic Hydrochloric<br>
acid (Bull.Chem.Soc. Japan 55.1325(1982)).<br>
The critical parameter associated with the synthesis of CoQ10  involving the above route<br>
is selection of protecting groups that can be (i) synthesized cost effectively, (ii)<br>
deprotected easily under mild condition and (iii) oxidized readily. The synthesis of<br>
compound     of    formula     6     where     R     is     -CH2OCH2CH2OCH3    requires<br>
methoxyethoxymethyl chloride.   Methoxyethoxymethyle chloride is a costly reagent<br>
and the requirement of two equivalents per one equivalent of the compound adds to the<br>
cost.<br>
Deprotection of the two methoxyethoxymethyl groups in compound of formula 9 where<br>
R is-CH20CH2CH2 OCH3 also requires drastic condition for deprotection that leads to<br>
impurity formation.<br>
The synthesis of CoQ10 from compound of formula 9 where R is -CH3 requires<br>
expensive reagent of eerie ammonium nitrate for oxidation step (J. Org. Chem.68,<br>
7925(2003)).<br>
We observed that the oxidation also results in side reactions and yield loss and<br>
therefore not cost effective.<br>
Use of CoQ10 in broadband medical application is increasing day by day. The key<br>
point in the synthesis of CoQ10 is the choice of the building blocks of i)"isoprene unit",<br>
(ii) "the benzoquinone nucleus" and (iii) "the polyprenyl side chain". A cost effective<br>
process of preparing CoQ 10 can be made only with the suitable "building blocks"<br>
which are made economically. An industrially viable process is currently lacking.<br>
Keeping the above facts in mind, we have explored various alternatives for the<br>
preparation of CoQ10. Our above-mentioned efforts have resulted in developing the<br>
following improved novel processes and novel intermediates<br>
1.	Improved process for the preparation of the "benzoquinone nucleus" - the head group of CoQ10. The process has also resulted in producing novel intermediates. These aspects have been made the subject of our co pending application no 803/MUM/2005<br>

3.	Improved process for the preparation of CoQ10, by coupling of the polyprenyl side chain of ten isoprene units, with the head group "bezoquinone nucleus". Such scheme of synthesis has been made the subject matter of our co pending application no 805/MUM/2005<br>
4.	An improved process for the preparation of CoQ10, by condensation of one isoprene unit to the head group "benzoquinone nucleus" to form novel intermediate C0Q1, which is coupled with solanesyl bromide. Such scheme of synthesis has been made the subject matter of our co pending application no 806/MUM/2005<br>
The present invention disclosed in this application relates to an improved process for the preparation of CoQlO , by condensation of one isoprene unit to the head group "benzoquinone nucleus" to form novel intermediate CoQlO, which is coupled with solanesyl bromide.<br>
