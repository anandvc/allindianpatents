				<td>Field of Invention<br>
The present invention, relates generally to air cleaning systems and is particularly directed<br>
to air cleaners of the type that use an electrostatic field to polarize a media and to polarize<br>
particles to increase the particle collection efficiency on the media.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
The principal of electrostatic attraction has been, used for many years to enhance the<br>
removal of contaminants from air streams. There are three primary categories of air<br>
electrostatic cleaners: electrostatic precipitators, passive electrostatic filters and active field<br>
polarized media air cleaners, which are sometimes known under different terms.<br>
Electrostatic precipitators charge particles and then capture them on oppositely charged<br>
and/or grounded collection plates,<br>
A passive electrostatic filter (also know as an electret) employs a media (or combination of<br>
different media) that through some combination, of treatment and/or inherent properties has<br>
an electrostatic charge. Particles entering the filter media that have an electrostatic charge<br>
are attracted to the charged media filter materials that have the opposite electrostatic<br>
charge.<br>
 <br>
An active field polarized media air cleaner uses an electrostatic field created by a voltage<br>
differential between two electrodes, A dielectric filter media is placed in the electrostatic<br>
field between the two electrodes. A dielectric material is an electrical insulator or a<br>
substance that is highly resistant to electric current that can also store electrical energy. A<br>
dielectric material tends to concentrate an applied electric field within itself and is thus an<br>
efficient supporter of electrostatic fields. The electrostatic field polarizes both the media<br>
fibers aad the particles that enter, thereby increasing the efficiency of the media and the air<br>
cleaner. The efficiency of the filter is the percentage of particles removed from the air<br>
stream at a given.particle size, or for a range of particle sizes.<br>
A further electrostatic air filter design is disclosed in Canadian. Patent No, 1,272,453, in,<br>
which a disposable rectangular cartridge is connected to a high voltage power supply. The<br>
cartridge consists of a conductive inner center screen, which is sandwiched between two<br>
layers of a dielectric fibrous material, (either plastic or glass). The two dielectric layers are,<br>
in turn, farther sandwiched between two outer screens of conductive material. The<br>
conductive inner center screen is raised to a high voltage, thereby creating an. electrostatic<br>
field between the conductive inner center screen and the two conductive outer screens that<br>
are kept at an opposite or ground potential. The high voltage electrostatic field polarizes<br>
the fibers of the two dielectric layers.<br>
The air cleaners may be installed in a variety of configurations and situations, both as part<br>
of a hearing ventilating aad air conditioning (HVAC) system sad in standalone air<br>
moving/cleaning systems In smaller HVAC systems (e.g. residential and light<br>
 <br>
commercial), the air cleaner panels are often installed in a flat configuration (perpendicular<br>
to the airflow) or in angled filter tracks. In larger systems, banks of air filters are typically<br>
arranged in a V-bank configuration where multiple separate filters are positioned to form a<br>
Z-fold filter perpendicular to the axis of airflow.<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
The invention is embodied in improvements to active field polarized media air cleaners.<br>
AERODYNAMIC FRONT COWLING<br>
In accordance with one aspect of the present invention, a V-bank configuration, of active<br>
field polarized media air cleaners includes an aerodynamic front cowling joining front<br>
edges of adjacent active field polarized media panel air cleaners facing the airflow. The<br>
front cowling provides a lower form drag airflow to reduce filter static pressure drop<br>
(resistance to airflow). In addition, the hollow interior of the aerodynamic front cowling<br>
provides a recess for concealing the high voltage power supply inside the aerodynamic<br>
front cowling, providing protection and insulation of the electrical components. Further,<br>
the cowling serves as a wire chase for running both high .and low voltage wires between air<br>
cleaner panels and adjacent air cleaner modules.<br>
REAR DOUBLE HINGE AIR SEAL<br>
 <br>
In accordance with another aspect of the present invention, a V-bank configuration of<br>
active field polarized media air cleaners includes a rear double hinge joining rear edges of<br>
adjacent active field polarized media air cleaners. The rear double hinge provides a<br>
positive seal between adjacent active field polarized media air cleaners, thereby reducing<br>
blow-by between adjacent active field polarized media air cleaners and increasing<br>
efficiency.<br>
IMPROVED .ELECTRODE FOR POLARIZED MEDIA AIR CLEANER<br>
In accordance with another aspect of the present invention, the high voltage electrode is<br>
made from a conductive extruded plastic netting or other similar material that provides for<br>
significantly higher operational voltages and therefore higher efficiencies.<br>
RESISTIVE CENTER SCREEN AND VARIABLE HIGH VOLTAGE POWER SUPPLY<br>
In accordance with yet another aspect of the present invention, more than one active field<br>
polarized media air cleaners may share a single high voltage power supply. In such<br>
manner, if one active field polarized media air cleaner shorts out, the resistance of the<br>
center screen will limit the current drawn from the high-voltage power supply by the short<br>
circuit, thereby permitting the other active field polarized media air cleaner sharing the<br>
same power supply to continue operating normally.<br>
Additionally, the high-voltage power supplies may be made variable so that an optimal<br>
voltage may be selected that provides an optimum electrostatic field without arcing.<br>
 <br>
DIELECTRIC MEDIA SUPPORT FRAME<br>
In accordance with another aspect of the present invention, an active field polarized media<br>
air cleaner includes a dielectric media support frame having on one side a recess or shelf<br>
for holding the center screen and/or the filter media and on the other side a protrusion for<br>
creating a positive seal with the conductive holding frame that holds the conductive outer<br>
screens. The dielectric media support frame allows the center screen to extend to the edge<br>
of the filter media without shorting or arcing to the conductive outer screens or to the<br>
conductive holding frame, an arrangement that provides a more uniform electrostatic field<br>
throughout the filter media. The border provided by the dielectric media support frame also<br>
prevents the spraying of corona at the edges of the center conductive screen. The positive<br>
seal between the dielectric media support frame and the conductive holding frame reduces<br>
air leakage (blow-by) between the conductive holding frame and the edge of the filter<br>
media. The dielectric media support frame can be made of either rigid or flexible plastic<br>
material.<br>
FLAT CONDUCTIVE OUTER SCREEN<br>
For a more uniform distance between electrodes and therefore a more uniform field<br>
throughout the active field polarized media air cleaner, the conductive outer screen is made<br>
relatively flat as compared to the flexible outer screens of prior art active field polarized<br>
media air cleaners. The flatness of the outer screen is achieved by using a relatively rigid<br>
material as compared to the dielectric filter material.<br>
 <br>
IMPROVED HIGH VOLTAGE CONTACT<br>
One of the problems in prior art active field polarized media air cleaners is the area where<br>
the high-voltage probe contacts the center screen. Typically in the prior art, the high<br>
voltage connection is made with a probe or clip that contacts the center screen (or<br>
electrode) over a relatively small area. In some cases, the contact becomes poor. The<br>
problem with this arrangement is that over time, the point of contact can arc, spray and<br>
erode the area of contact on the electrode and make less certain contact. As this erosion<br>
progresses, it can. accelerate to the point where contact is no longer being made. The<br>
present invention overcomes this problem and maintains air cleaner integrity by various<br>
means making the high voltage contact a large area by means of a disc and/or disc and<br>
fastener thai, spreads the connection over a far wider surface of the electrode. While<br>
various embodiments of the invention will show the high-voltage contact area as circular,<br>
other shapes would work as well<br>
Also, there is a tendency to spray corona and/or arc in the region of the high-voltage probe,<br>
To reduce spraying and, arcing in the region where the high-voltage probe contacts the<br>
center screen, a high-voltage probe enclosed in a high voltage shield is provided.<br>

Detailed description<br>
A plurality of active field polarized media air cleaner panels (filters), arranged in a V-bank<br>
configuration 100, in accordance with the present invention is shown in figure 1. The<br>
individual filter panels 101 may be referred to herein as either a "panel", "filter" and/or an<br>
"air cleaner." A plurality of active field polarized media air cleaners 101 are organized into<br>
a plurality of stackable modules 1.02 each module having a width. W, a height H tad a<br>
depth D that is variable, depending on the application. In particular, the V-bank 100 in<br>
figure 1 contains eight stackable modules 102 each of which contains eight individual<br>
active field polarized media air cleaners for a total of 64 air cleaners.<br>
A typical active field polarized media air cleaner is shown in figure .16, A first pad of<br>
fibrous dielectric material 16A is disposed above a center screen 110. On the other side of<br>
the center screen 110 is a second pad of dielectric filter material 16B. The first pad of<br>
dielectric filter material is attached to the dielectric media support frame 120 by a suitable<br>
means such as adhesive material 121A or ultrasonic welding. Above the first pad of<br>
dielectric filter material 16A is a first conductive outer screen 12A. Below the second pad<br>
 <br>
of dielectric filter material 16B is a second conductive outer screen 12B. The second pad of<br>
dielectric filter material is attached to the dielectric media support frame 120 by a suitable<br>
means, such as adhesive material 121B or ultrasonic welding. The first conductive outer<br>
screen, 12A is held in place by a first conductive holding frame 116A, 'The second<br>
conductive outer screen 12B is held in place by a second conductive holding frame 116B.<br>
The filter media itself consists of a dielectric media support frame 120, a first pad of<br>
fibrous dielectric material 16A, a center, screen 110 and second pad of dielectric filter<br>
material 16B. The filter holding frame that holds the filter media consists of a first<br>
conductive holding frame 116A with a first conductive outer screen I2A, acid a second<br>
conductive holding frame 116B with a second conductive outer screen 12B.<br>
In operation, one terminal of a high voltage power supply 108 is connected to center screen.<br>
110. The other terminal of the high-voltage power supply 108 is coupled to the first<br>
conductive outer screen 12A and the second conductive outer screen 12B, which is held<br>
typically at ground potential.<br>
Particles in the incoming air passing through dielectric filter material 16A and 16B of the<br>
active field polarized media air cleaner of figure 16 are polarized by the electric field<br>
therein and collected on the first and second pads of dielectric filter material 16 A, 16B.<br>
AERODYNAMIC FRONT COWLING<br>
<br>
 <br>
A cross-sectional view of an individual module 102 from figure I is shown in figure 2,<br>
Each of the individual active field polarized media air cleaners 110A, HOB, 1 IOC, HOD,<br>
110E, 110F, 110G and 110H are held in place to a V-bank formation. At the front of the<br>
module 102 a plurality of cowlings holds each filter in place. In particular, there are two<br>
end cowlings 104 A and 104B at the top and bottom of module 102. In between the two end<br>
cowlings, there are three middle cowlings 106A, 106B and 106C. The aerodynamic shape<br>
of the cowlings provides for a lower form drag airflow thereby reducing the .static (air<br>
resistance) of the filter,<br>
A detailed view of a center cowling 106C is shown: in figure 8. A removable cap 107A is<br>
coupled to the body of the cowling 106C by a dovetail joint. The removable cap permits<br>
the insertion of a power supply 108C (not shown to scale). This shields the electronics in<br>
the power supply 108C from the air stream and insulates it from grounded surfaces of the<br>
outer filter holding frames and system housing. Further, the center cowling 106C provides<br>
a chase or tray for both, low and high voltage wires to be run between panels or modules.<br>
The center cowling 106C includes a first and second attachment points, 107B and 107C A<br>
detailed view of aa end cowling 104A is shown in figure 6. An end piece 109 (shown in<br>
figure 7) is coupled to the end cowling 104 A by a dovetail joint. In other embodiments of<br>
the present invention, the dovetail may be of a variety of shapes such as "L'"s or "T'"s or<br>
alternately there may be no mating protrusion and the cowling would be bonded, screwed<br>
or otherwise attached to the filter holding frames.<br>
A completed assembly of the aerodynamic front cowling coupled to the filter holding<br>
frames of two active field polarized media air cleaners is shown, in figure 9. First and<br>
<br>
 <br>
second pads of dielectric filter material 16A 16B and a center screen 110A are coupled to a<br>
dielectric media support frame 120A. The dielectric media support frame 120A is held in<br>
place between aa upper conductive frame 116A and a lower conductive frame 116B. The<br>
lower conductive frame 116B is coupled to the attachment point 107B of the center<br>
cowling 106 by a dovetail joint.<br>
Similarly, first and second pads of dielectric filter material 17A, 17B and a center screen<br>
110B are coupled to a dielectric media support frame 120B, The dielectric media support<br>
frame 120B is held in place between an upper conductive frame 116C and a lower<br>
conductive frame 116D, The upper conductive frame 116C is coupled to the attachment<br>
point 107C of the center cowling 106 by a dovetail joint<br>
The center aerodynamic cowling 106 provides for lower form drag airflow over the two<br>
active field polarized media air cleaner panels. Further, it decreases assembly time of die<br>
modules.<br>
REAR DOUBLE HINGE .AIR SEAL<br>
At the rear of the module 102 (figure 2) a plurality of double hinges holds each filter in<br>
place. Each double binge is comprised of three binges H1, H2 and H3. As shown, in figure<br>
3, the first hinge H1 has a first attachment point coupled to an upper frame 112A, and a<br>
second attachment point coupled to a lower feme 112B. The hinge H1 has a pivot point<br>
that permits the lower frame 112B to rotate away from the upper frame 112A so as to<br>
<br>
 <br>
allow a replacement filter media to be inserted into the active field polarized media air<br>
cleaner 110G,<br>
Similarly, as shown in figure 4, the second hinge H2 has a first attachment point coupled to<br>
an upper frame 114A, and a second attachment point coupled to a lower frame 114B. The<br>
hinge H2 has a pivot point that permits the upper frame 114A to rotate away from the<br>
lower frame 114B so as to allow a replacement filter media to be inserted into the active<br>
field polarized media air cleaner 110H.<br>
A third hinge H3 as a first attachment point coupled to the first hinge H1 and a second<br>
attachment point coupled to the second hinge H2. The third hinge H3 has a third pivot<br>
point such that the upper active field polarized media air cleaner (112A, 112B) can rotate<br>
as a unit with respect to the lower active field polarized media air cleaner (114A, 114B).<br>
The use of double hinges at the rear of module 102 provides for flexibility in mounting<br>
active field polarized media air cleaners at different angles wiih respect to each, other. The<br>
double hinge at the rear of the module 102 also provides a good ait1 seal at the rear of the<br>
filters regardless of the different angles for mounting individual air cleaners. The positive<br>
seal provided by the double hinge at the rear of the filters reduces blow by, Le. the the<br>
portion of the air stream, passing by the filter arrangement without passing through the<br>
filter media.<br>
The double hinge of the present invention is shown in further detail in figures 10, 11, 12<br>
and 13. Each hinge is formed by a plastic extrusion comprising rigid and flexible plastic<br>
regions. In figure 1.0, a first hinge has a first attachment point 140 and a second attachment<br>
<br>
 <br>
point 144. The first and second attachment points 140,144 rotate with respect to each other<br>
around a pivot area 144. The attachment points 140, 144 are generally rigid plastic or other<br>
material components as compared to the more flexible material, typically plastic, of the<br>
pivot area 141. The pivot area 141 is typically made of flexible plastic, which forms a<br>
pivot point about which the first and second attachment points 140, 144 may rotate. Other<br>
combinations of materials, for example metal and rubber, are also possible.<br>
As shown in figure 13, two of the hinges of the type shown in figure 10 are used in<br>
combination with a third hinge to form the double hinge of the present invention. The first<br>
of such hinges is shown as 140A having a pivot area 141A, The second of such hinges is<br>
shown as 140B having a pivot area 141B. A third hinge 142A in figure 13 (also shown in<br>
figure 11) has a first attachment point 142 and second attachment point 145, which rotate<br>
with respect to each other about pivot area 143. The first attachment point of hinge 142A is<br>
coupled via a dovetail joint to the first hinge 140A. The second attachment point of hinge<br>
142A is coupled via a dovetail joint to the second hinge 140B. The assembly of the first<br>
hinge 140A, the second hinge 140B and the third hinge 142A forms the double hinge of<br>
the present invention.<br>
Figure 12 illustrates two active field polarized media air cleaner panels coupled to a double<br>
hinge. The upper 116A and lower 116B conductive holding frames of a first filter panel<br>
115A are coupled to the first hinge 140A. la particular, the upper conductive frame 116A<br>
of the first filter panel 115 A is typically an aluminum extrusion (or other suitable material)<br>
having a shape forming a dovetail joint coupled to the first attachment point of the first<br>
hinge 140A. The lower conductive frame 116B of the first filter panel USA is an<br>
<br>
 <br>
aluminum extrusion having a shape forming a dovetail joint coupled to the second<br>
attachment point of the first hinge 140A. As will be discussed elsewhere, the frames 116A,<br>
116B may also be made of a non-conductive material.<br>
Similarly, the upper conductive frame 116C of the second filter panel 115B is an.<br>
aluminum extrusion having a shape forming a dovetaii joint coupled to Hie first attachment<br>
point of the second hinge 140B. The lower conductive frame 116D of the second filter<br>
panel 115B is an aluminum extrusion having a shape forming a dovetail joint coupled to<br>
the second attachment point of the second hinge 140B.<br>
Thus, the upper conductive frame 116A and the lower conductive frame 116B of the first<br>
filter panel 115 A may rotate with respect to each other about pivot point 141A of the first<br>
hinge 140A. Similarly, the upper conductive frame 116C and the tower conductive frame<br>
116D of the second filter panel 115B may rotate with respect to each other about pivot<br>
point 141B of the second hinge 140B, Finally, by use of the double hinge of the present<br>
invention, the first filter panel 115A and the second filter panel 115B may rotate with<br>
respect to each other about pivot point 143 of the third hinge 142A.<br>
Alternatively, the outer frame members 116A, 116B, 116C, 116D may be constructed of<br>
tubing or "L" s that are formed, welded, or otherwise constructed into a substantially<br>
rectangular frame. The external screens (12A, 12B in figure 16) could then be screwed,<br>
welded, or otherwise secured to the frame members. Similarly the hinge and cowling<br>
assemblies could instead of dovetail joints, be screwed, bonded, or otherwise secured to<br>
the sides of the frame. Further, the "dovetail" as disclosed above could be a "T" or "L" or<br>
<br>
 <br>
other shape that would provide a positive attachment between the frame member and the<br>
hinge in the front or the cowling in the rear.<br>
IMPROVED ELECTRODE DESIGN<br>
While various air permeable materials and grids are described in the prior art (e.g., for use<br>
as the center screen), extruded plastic netting is not disclosed, Extruded plastic nettings are<br>
made from a wide variety of materials, with either low or high-density polyethylene, being<br>
among the most common, The extruded plastic netting is typically made conductive by<br>
adding carbon or other agents to the plastic resins. The resulting conductivity is variable<br>
and controllable depending on the specific formula used. Fire retardants are also used to<br>
make the material suitable for use as a center screen electrode in active field polarized air<br>
filtration applications. Extruded plastic netting material has been found to have many<br>
advantages from manufacturing and operational standpoints for use as an electrode in an<br>
active field polarized media air cleaner. The primary advantages of extruded plastic netting<br>
derive from the shape and form of the members of the netting (particularly the lack of<br>
sharp edge shapes formed around the openings of the netting).<br>
When using high voltage potentials between electrodes, a number of factors contribute to<br>
the propensity for arcing, spraying and corona discharge and the point at which it occurs.<br>
The important factors Include the shape, consistency, flatness, and spacing of the members<br>
or fibers of the electrodes. Sharp edges, burrs, kinks, stray fuzz or fibers, points, etc. all<br>
promote spraying and corona discharge. Because of its fabrication process, extruded plastic<br>
netting is substantially free of these defects. The resultant center screen grid therefore<br>
<br>
 <br>
allows for maximum operational voltages and therefore higher field strengths and greater<br>
filter efficiencies. Specifically, it has been found that a center screes made from an<br>
extruded plastic netting can carry an operational voltage 20-30% higher than a carbon<br>
impregnated foam aad up to 40% higher than an aluminum screen. Although a low-<br>
density polyethylene is an excellent material for this application, as it lies substantially flat,<br>
other materials substantially lacking in sharp features such as sharp edges, burrs, kinks,<br>
stray fuzz or fibers, points, etc. will also be appropriate.<br>
RESISTIVE CENTER SCREEN AND VARIABLE HIGH VOLTAGE POWER SUPPLY<br>
The aerodynamic cowlings shown in figure 2 are hollow, and, in each middle cowling<br>
106A, 106B and 106C there is a respective high-voltage power supply 108A, 108B and<br>
108C. The three high voltage power supplies 108A, 108B and 108C are shared among the<br>
eight active field polarized media air cleaners 110A, 110B, 110C, 110D, 110E, 110F,<br>
110G and 110H. See figure 5. It should be noted that there amid be one power supply for<br>
several or all panels in a module or all modules in an HVAC system or one power supply<br>
per panel. The goal is a balance between operational redundancy and overall system cost<br>
Therefore, the present arrangement provides for two or more panels to share a single power<br>
supply without one panel being able to adversely impact the operation of the other panels<br>
sharing the same power supply.<br>
In accordance with one aspect of the present invention, the center screen of each active<br>
field polarized media air cleaner is resistive rather than conductive. As shown in figure 5,<br>
the eight active field polarized media air cleaners 110A, 110B, 110C, 110D, 110E, 111F,<br>
<br>
 <br>
110G and 110H are represented by the symbols for a resistor, In particular, high-voltage<br>
power supply 108A is coupled to the center screen for the three active field polarized<br>
media air cleaners 110A, 110B and 110C. High-voltage power supply 108B is coupled to<br>
the center screen for the two active field polarized media air cleaners 110D and 10E.<br>
Finally, high-voltage power supply 108C is coupled to the center screen for the three active<br>
field polarized media and cleaners 110F, 110G and 110H.<br>
The shared high-voltage power supply in combination with a resistive center screen and<br>
active field polarized media air cleaner permits the filters to still continue to operate in the<br>
event that the center screen of one of the air cleaners is shorted to ground. For example, if<br>
the center screen of filter 110H were shorted to ground (as illustrated by short circuit 110S)<br>
the remaining resistance of the portion of the center screen between the short 110S and<br>
high-voltage power supply, would permit high-voltage power supply 108C to continue<br>
operating. Thus, even if the center screen of filter 110H has been shorted to ground, the<br>
other fitters connected to the same power supply (namely 110F and 110G) would continue<br>
to operate.<br>
If, as in the prior art, the center screen was highly conductive, then a short circuit of one of<br>
the center screens would result in the collapse of the voltage from the high-voltage power<br>
supply thereby disabling all of the filters connected to the same high-voltage power supply<br>
To avoid a short circuit in the center screen of one filter from disabling other filters, prior<br>
art banks of filters provided for one power supply per filter. The resistive center electrode<br>
(screen) could be made of a variety of materials. For example, an extruded plastic net or<br>
<br>
 <br>
carbon impregnated foam or mesh. In a forther embodiment of the invention the center<br>
screen would have odor-absorbing properties, such as a carbon impregnated foam or mesh.<br>
Furthermore, high-voltage power supplies 108A, 108B and 108C are made variable. That<br>
is, the output voltage provided by power supply 108A to the center screens of active field<br>
polarized media air cleaners 110A, 110B and 110C is adjustable. Similarly, the output<br>
voltage provided by power supply 1088 to the center .screens of active field polarized<br>
media air cleaners 110D and 1.10.E is adjustable. In similar manner the output voltage<br>
provided by power .supply 108C to the center screens of active field polarized media air<br>
cleaners 110F, 110G and 110H is adjustable.<br>
Adjustability of the high-voltage potential applied to the center screens of the active field<br>
polarized media air cleaners permits an optimization of electrostatic field strength.<br>
Generally speaking, the highest possible voltage before arcing occurs is the most desirable<br>
choice. However, the highest possible voltage is dependent on several factors such as<br>
altitude and humidity. A higher voltage level is desirable where the filters are installed at a<br>
sea level location. Conversely, at higher altitude a lower voltage is desirable. The optimum<br>
voltage is also related to humidity. In dryer climates, a higher voltage may be applied to<br>
the filters without arcing. In climates experiencing higher humidity conditions a lower<br>
voltage to prevent arcing is desirabis. The adjustability of high-voltagc power supplies<br>
108A, 108B and 108C permits the selection of an optimal electrostatic field under<br>
appropriate altitude and climate conditions. Further, the arcing voltage will be a function of<br>
the materials of both the charged electrode and the media. Variability of the power supply<br>
allows for the optimization of the voltage depending on the materials used as well.<br>
<br>
 <br>
DIELECTRIC MEDIA SUPPORT FRAME<br>
A cross-sectional view of a dielectric media support frame 120 in accordance with the<br>
present invention is shown in figure 18. The dielectric media support frame, which is<br>
typically formed by extrusion, includes vertical flanges 120A and 120D. The dielectric<br>
media support frame 120 also includes horizontal flanges or shelves 120C1 and 120C2.<br>
The horizontal flanges or shelves 120C1 and. 120C2 form a recess 122. Opposite the recess<br>
122 is a protrusion 124 having flexible fins 126 on both sides,<br>
Figate 16 illustrates the use of the dielectric media support frame of the present invention<br>
in an active field polarized media air cleaner. A first function of the dielectric media<br>
support frame 120 is to permit the center screen 110 of an active field polarised media air<br>
cleaner to extend all the way to the edge of the filter media. Another function of the<br>
dielectric media support frame 120 is to prevent arcing to the upper or lower conductive<br>
holding frames 116A, 116B and reduce the spraying of corona at the edges of the center<br>
conductive screen 110, To accomplish these 'functions, the center screen 110 is held in<br>
place on one of the shelves 120C1; 120C2 forming the recess 122 of the dielectric media<br>
support frame 120.<br>
An alternate embodiment of a dielectric media support frame 120X in accordance with the<br>
present invention is shown in figure 22. In lieu of a recess, the dielectric media support<br>
frame 120X has a single horizontal flange or shelf 120Z. The first pad of dielectric filter<br>
material 16A, the center screen 110 and the second pad of dielectric filter material 16B rest<br>
<br>
 <br>
on shelf 120Z. The first pad of dielectric filter material is attached to the dielectric media<br>
support frame 120 by a suitable means such as adhesive material 121X or ultrasonic<br>
welding.<br>
Yet another alternate embodiment of a dielectric media support frame 120Y in accordance<br>
with the present invention is shown in figure 23, In figure 23 the tise of adhesive material<br>
(121A and 121B in figure 16, or 121X in figure 22) is eliminated, The recess 122Y is made<br>
large enough so that the first pad of dielectric filter material 16A, the center screen 110 and<br>
the second pad of dielectric filter material 16B are positioned in the recess 122Y of the<br>
dielectric media support frame 120Y.<br>
Alternatively, the insuiating/conduetive properties of the dielectric media support frame<br>
(120 in figure 16) and the upper aad tower conductive holding frames (116A, 116B in<br>
figure 16) could be reversed. That is, the media support frame 120 could be conductive (or<br>
not a complete insulator) and the upper and lower holding frames 116A, 116B could be an<br>
insulator (i.e. a dielectric or non-conductive material) or be insulated by having a holding<br>
clip wrap around the mating surfaces of the holding frames or by having am insulating<br>
material applied to them. In, the latter case, the media support frame 120 may be omitted<br>
with the center screen 110 sandwiched between upper 116A and lower 116B non-<br>
conducting and/or insulated holding frames.<br>
A second function of the dielectric media support frame is to form a positive seal between<br>
the upper conductive holding frame 116A and the lower conductive holding frame 116B.<br>
For the latter purpose, the protrusion 124 and flexible fins 126 of the dielectric media<br>
<br>
 <br>
support frame form a positive seal between the upper conductive holding frame 116A and<br>
the lower conductive holding frame 116B, Alternatively, the protrusion from the dielectric<br>
media support frame could press against the upper conductive holding frame 116A and/or<br>
the lower conductive holding frame 116B rather than being pressed between the upper and<br>
lower conductive holding frames 116A, 1168. In general, protrusion 124 is any shape that<br>
creates a positive seal between the media support frame 120 and the holding frame(s)<br>
116A.116B.<br>
FLAT CONDUCTIVE OUTER SCREEN<br>
A first conductive outer screen 12A is held in place by the upper conductive frame 116A.<br>
A second conductive outer screen 12B is held in place by the lower conductive frame<br>
1.16B. For the sake of clarity, the retaining clips (118 in, figures 15 and 17) that hold the<br>
outer screens 12A and 12B to upper and lower conductive frames 116A and 116B<br>
respectively are omitted in .figure 16. A cross-sectional view of the retaining clip 118 is<br>
illustrated in figure 15. A detail view of how the retaining clip 118 is assembled with the<br>
conductive frame 116 is shown in figure 17. First, the conductive outer screen 12 is<br>
inserted into the recess of the conductive holding frame 116. Thereafter, the retaining clip<br>
118 is rotated into place. The retaining clip 118 holds the conductive outer screen 12 in the<br>
conductive holding frame 116. The retaining clip 118 is an elongated spline that rims the<br>
eatire length of the frame.<br>
The conductive outer screen 12 (in figure 17) is made of a sufficiently rigid material so as<br>
to lie substantially flat when placed against the pad of fibrous dielectric material (16A or<br>
<br>
 <br>
16B in figure 16), The conductive outer screen 12 permits air to flow through it. The<br>
conductive outer screen 12 may be made of perforated solid sheet material or of expanded<br>
sheet material, for example expanded metal. Expanded metal is sheet material that is slit<br>
and pulled apart so that the slits stretch open to form passageways for airflow,<br>
The conductive outer screen 12A, 12B being relatively rigid compared to the pad of<br>
fibrous dielectric material 16A, l6Bf compresses the dielectric material preventing a<br>
bowing or "pillow" effect This, when the conductive holding screens 116A and 116B are<br>
closed around the pads of dielectric filter material 16A and 16B, the conductive outer<br>
screens 12A and 12B are substantially flat and substantially parallel to each other.<br>
Substantially flat conductive outer screens 12A, 12B provides for a more uniform field<br>
throughout the active field polarized media air cleaner. In the prior art, the outer screen<br>
flexes into a pillow shape, in which case the maximum high-voltage is limited by the<br>
minimum spacing (typically near the edges), In the prior art, most of the screen, area in. the<br>
middle of the active field polarized media air filter will be much 'further away from the<br>
center screen (as compared to the area near the edges) thus reducing the electrostatic field<br>
which in rum reduces the efficiency of the filter. As compared to the prior art, the<br>
electrostatic field of the present invention will be more uniform, throughout the filter media<br>
and can be sustained at a higher voltage and therefore support a greater electrostatic field.<br>
IMPROVED HIGH VOLTAGE CONTACT WITH CENTER SCREEN<br>
<br>
 <br>
As indicated in figure 16, a first terminal of a high-voltage power supply 108 is coupled to<br>
the center screen 110. In the prior art, a high-voltage probe would pass through the<br>
conductive outer screen, piercing the pad of fibrous dielectric material 16A or sliding<br>
between the two pads 16A and B to make contact by pressing against the center screen<br>
110. Often, such contacts were unreliable. If the high-voltage probe failed to make contact<br>
with the center screen, then there would be no electrostatic field across the pads of<br>
dielectric filter material 16A, 16B greatly reducing the filter efficiency. Furthermore, the<br>
sharp point of a high-voltage probe often resulted in the spraying of corona and/or arcing<br>
to the conductive outer screens 12A, 12B, Further, because the center screen material is<br>
typically sparse and air permeable and because the contact area was relatively small, arcing<br>
could lead to an erosion of the center screen and a loss of contact.<br>
In accordance with the present invention, a conductive disc is attached to the center screen<br>
in the area where the high voltage probe would make contact. See figure 19, Adding a<br>
contact area to the center screen allows for the use of a more resilient material and further,<br>
increase the area of contact with the charged electrode (center screen).<br>
When a relatively sparse filter media, .material, is used, a piercing or penetrating high-<br>
voltage probe may be employed, and the disc(s) would be on either side of the center<br>
screen. However, with denser filter media, it is preferable to have one conductive disc<br>
press against the denser filter media and another conductive disc press against the center<br>
screen. The two conductive discs would be mechanically an electrically connected to each<br>
other.<br>
<br>
 <br>
In accordance with the present invention, a high-voltage contact protected by a high-<br>
voltage shield to reliably contact the center screen is shown in figure 19. A rivet 136 is<br>
passed through a hole in the center screen 13. A conductive disk (e.g. titanium) 133<br>
secures the rivet 136 to the center screen 13, which provides a good connection between<br>
the rivet 136 and the charged electrode or center screen 13. Alternatively, a second metallic<br>
disk can be placed beneath the head of the rivet.<br>
In a further embodiment of the invention, a high-voltage probe 130 passes through the<br>
conductive outer screen 12A and terminates in a high-voltage contact 134. A high-voltage<br>
shield of insulating dielectric material 132A surrounds the high-voltage contact 134,<br>
Similarly, a high-voltage shield of insulating dielectric material 132B surrounds lower end<br>
of the rivet 136 and tire metallic disk 133. Alternatively, the high-voltage probe may be<br>
routed on the inside of the conductive outer screens 116A, 116B.<br>
A top view of the filter media in figure 19 is shown in figure 20. A dielectric media<br>
support frame 120 surrounds the pad of dielectric filter material 16A. The rivet or<br>
attachment means 136 passes through the pad of dielectric filter material 16A.<br>
A top view of the frame that holds the filter media in Igure 19 is shown in figure 21. Four<br>
conductive outer filter holding frame pieces 116 and four plastic end caps 128 form a<br>
frame to hold the conductive outer screen 12. The high-voltage contact 134 is positioned<br>
within the insulating high-voltage shield 132A.<br>
<br>
 <br>
In operation, when the conductive outer filter holding frames 116A and 116B (figure 19)<br>
are closed around the filter media (120, 16A, 13 and 16B) the high-voltage contact 134<br>
contacts the head of the rivet 136, Also, the high-voltage shields 132A and 132B slightly<br>
compress the pads of dielectric filter material 16A and 16B, The high-voltage contact 134<br>
assures a reliable connection with the head of the rivet 136. The insulating high-voltage<br>
shields 132A, 132B reduce the spraying of corona from the tip of the high-voltage contact<br>
134. Furthermore, the insulating high-voltage shields 132A, 132B reduce the chances of<br>
arcing from the high-voltage contact 134 to the conductive outer screens 12A and 12B.<br>
The high-voltage contact 134 is typically made of rigid titanium or other resilient material.<br>
In making contact with the head of the rivet 136, the center screen 13 may flex slightly;<br>
Alternatively, the high-voltage contact. 134 can be a spring contact to reduce the flexing of<br>
the center screen 13. Alternative arrangements for the contact area 136 on the center screen<br>
13 include a conductive disk on the top side of the center screen 13, a pair of conductive<br>
discs, one on the top and the other on the bottom of the center screen, with a fastener<br>
passing through the center screen and holding the two discs together. The key point is that<br>
the rigidity of the high-voltage probe 134 or the rigidity of the external conductive outer<br>
screens or both, in conjunction force a positive mechanical contact between the end of the<br>
high-voltage probe 134 and the disc or disc/rivet combination 136. The result is a firm<br>
contact that cannot be compromised by vibration, or media movement or center screen<br>
(electrode) movement.<br>

frame to produce a more uniform electrostatic field and reduce blow by, while at the same<br>
time reducing the tendency to spray corona and/or arc at the edges of the center screen, a<br>
substantially flat conductive outer screen to produce a more uniform electrostatic field<br>
throughout the filter media and a high-voltage shield to reduce high-voltage arcing and the<br>
spraying of corona where the high-voltage probe contacts the center screen.</td>
