PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed: -<br><br>
                                                                             1 <br>
The invention relates to a procedure and a fixture for rewinding, for example, of thread feed reels produced on a ring spinning machine, which have at their top end a cone tapering off onto the bobbin tube and from where the tread is drawn off over head, wherein the threads of individual feed reels - being rewound - are connected with each other and are wound to a cross reel and the delivery thread from the thread feed reel runs through a thread guide arranged at a distance from the thread feed reel before reaching the reeling point.<br>
These kind of thread feed reels are for example produced on ring spinning machines and are normally called cops. To obtain large thread lengths, these cops are rewound by means of winding automats on conical or cylindrical cross wound bobbins, wherein faulty thread sections, like for example, thick spots etc. are removed.<br>
To achieve high rewinding speeds, for the rewinding process fixtures for supporting the drawing off of the thread are known. These are aimed at suppressing the occurrence of the thread balloon and resultant high thread tensions. While doing this the aim is to prevent the single balloon at higher draw off speeds, which causes the greatest thread tensions, in favor of a multiple balloon, in which considerably smaller thread tensions are reached especially while unwinding the windings at the lower end of the cop. For example, in the DE 42 21 559 A 1 such a fixture has been described with a first limiting element, which can be lowered for unwinding of the thread from a thread feed reel, and a second limiting element, which has an opening, being arranged directly above the upper edge of the winding tube of the reel. Overall, all these known balloon limiter. are equipment, which restrict a radial expansion of the thread balloon or interrupt the same through touching the thread in the balloon (DE 1 213 322).<br>
Through this balloon limiting equipment the thread draw off tension should be kept in limits, which increases with the increase in winding speed. The larger the diameter of the thread balloon, the higher is the thread tension caused by the centrifugal force, which ultimately leads to a break of the thread and thereby to an<br>
2<br><br>
interruption of the winding process. Besides, with increasing winding speed also the phenomenon of thread slippage in the feed reel occurs. A few thread windings become loose in ring shape and are pulled high, so that the thread gets entangled, which also leads to thread breaks. Therefore, according to the above mentioned patent document (DE 42 21 559) a controllable balloon limiter was suggested, which presses the balloon downwards, so that also while unwinding the lower portion of the feed reel the unwinding angle of the thread unwound from the conical area remains large and the friction between the thread remaining on the reel and the unwound thread is reduced. Thereby, snapping up of yarn layers should be reduced.<br>
Notwithstanding the complicated nature of this known fixture the winding speed could be raised only from around 1,000 m/min to 1,300 m/min with satisfactory results. In the use of balloon limiters the thread is pressed onto it due to the centrifugal force, so that due to the friction fluff occurs and the thread becomes rough. This leads to the fact that for the increased production output a deterioration of yarn quality through the rewinding process has to be accepted.<br>
Older studies (Textilpraxis 1957, Page 1205) have revealed that the problem of ballooning and the resultant high thread tensions can be resolved in a way that for avoiding the single balloon a maximum possible distance is provided between cops and thread guide. Distances up to 450 mm were investigated in this regard. Apart from the technical difficulties (Melliand, 1956, page 386) in execution of larger distance in the design, with balloon breaking equipment better results could be achieved, so that in the last 50 years only this was.followed up as optimum found solution.<br>
Task of the invention is, to avoid the shown disadvantages of the state of technology and to create a procedure and a fixture, which allow increase in the draw off speed without deteriorating the yarn quality.<br>
This task is resolved through the features of the claims 1,11,18 and 19. Surprisingly<br>
3<br><br>
it has been shown that one can do away with the usual balloon limiter, if for the stretch between reel and first thread guide a specific very large distance is maintained.<br>
The invention is based on the knowledge that a distance LF according to the characteristic of the claim 1 and the fixture claim 10 leads not only to a considerably higher winding speed, but besides the improvement of the process conditions this also leads to a considerable reduction of fluff and thus the yarn damage. Complex and costly balloon limiters due to controls are avoided. Approx. 40% to 50% higher winding speeds can be achieved with simultaneous reduction of thread breaks by more than 75% and a considerable reduction of yarn damage.<br>
Further details of the invention are described on the basis of drawings. These show as follows:<br>

Figures 12 and 13 The development of the thread guide as roller.<br>
In Figure 1 a winding station of traditional design has been shown, with a winding reel 1, which is normally developed as conical or cylindrical cross reel and driven by a winding roller or slotted drum 2. The thread Y is drawn off here from a cop or from a feed reel 81 via the top of the tube 8. Between the top of the tube 8 and the winding reel 1 normally a thread guide 6, a tensioning device 5, as well as a thick spot detector 4 and a splicing fixture 3 have been provided. Between the run-off point of the thread Y at the cop 81 and the thread guide 6 a thread balloon is formed, which causes very high thread tensions due to the centrifugal force of the thread Y in conjunction with the unwinding speed, so that the unwinding speed is limited. As shown in Figure 1, for this purpose, a balloon breaking device 7 above the cop 81 in front of the thread guide 6 is arranged, in order to prevent formation of a larger balloon. The cops 81 are fed by means of a feeder device 13 to a conveyor dish 14, through the rotation of which the feed reels are transported under the draw off point. When the drawing-off of the thread is finished the empty tube 8 is transported away on a collecting fixture 15.<br>
Several of these winding stations are arranged on a common machine stand, which mainly consist of a carrier pipe 11, which is simultaneously used also as suction channel, a stand 10 and a support pipe 12. In this, it is accepted that the thread Y strikes this balloon breaking device 7 with considerable friction, so that the thread Y is impacted not only by the tensioning forces, but also the yarn quality suffers due to friction and increase of fluff formation. In order to make the balloon suppression independent of the fact, whether the lower part of the cop or the upper part of the cop 81 is drawn, whereby the distance to the thread guide 6 changes, this balloon<br>
5<br><br>
breaking device 7 can also be designed as being controllable. The balloon breaking device 7 is moved every time over the cop that immediately after the thread has left the cop, it reaches in the area of the balloon breaking device 7, so that it does not come to ballooning at all. The draw off speed can be increased in this manner, however, but there are close limitations set to this increase. Heavy formation of fluff occurs.<br>
If one extends the stretch LF between the top edge of the tube 8 and thread guide 6, then first the balloon enlarges, if this is not prevented through a balloon breaking device 7. The enlarged thread balloon allows the thread tension to increase considerably. The increase of this thread tension has ultimately the consequence that the balloon collapses and the thread lies on the bobbin and rubs. Since in the single balloon the highest tensions occur, the aim is to avoid this. In case of further enlargement of the distance LF although multiple balloons are achieved, but their number varies while unwinding from cop top to cop base. Further, in the transit from one balloon type to another balloon type high tension spikes occur, which can lead to thread breaks. Therefore, in the rewinding process exclusive efforts have been made to remove these tension spikes through maximum possible small distances LF and mainly through the use of most diverse balloon breaking devices 7.<br>
Surprisingly it has shown that without the use of balloon breaking devices a very high reduction of thread breaks can be achieved, if a specific large distance IF can be maintained between the top edge of the bobbin 8 of the feed reel 81 and the first thread guide 6, so that an open stretch of considerable length emerges. Figure 7 shows a comparison of thread breaks, which were measured at an unwinding speed of 2200 meters e.g. for a polyester yarn Nm50 under various unwinding conditions. The first column has been set at 100% and it shows the thread breaks, which were measured without balloon breaking device at a distance IF = 300 mm between top edge of bobbin and thread guide 6. Through an increase of this distance to 450 mm, as was investigated in the earlier state of technology, the thread breaks could be reduced to 65%. With the use of balloon breaking devices and distance IF = 300 mm<br>
6<br><br>
the thread breaks amounted only to about 50%. Irrespective of the fact that through the enlargement of the distance IF a considerable reduction of thread breaks without balloon breaking devices could be achieved, the result with balloon breaking devices 7 is, however, better by another 15%, i.e. the thread breakages can be halved with balloon breaking devices 7. These results clearly show that an enlargement of distance IF causes not insignificant reduction of the thread breakages, that, however, with balloon breaking devices even better results can be achieved, without requiring to accept the technical problems of implementing the large distance. The balloon breaking devices 7 were, therefore, considered in the last 50 years as the optimum solution. However, the unwinding speeds could be increased only marginally despite intensive developments and different solution proposals.<br>
If one considers the unwinding pattern of the thread Y with and without balloon breaking device 7, then with the use of balloon breaking devices 7 emerges the image as shown in Figures 3 and 5. In the usual unwinding lengths LI, which were kept to the minimum due to structural reasons, several balloons get formed due the use of a balloon breaking device 7, whereby the thread tension is reduced and also the considerable reduction of thread breakages can be explained. If one increases the distance LF, then a single balloon is also avoided, even if no balloon breaking devices 7 are used.<br>
The highest tensions occur during the unwinding of the cop base, where also the drawn off thread Y attaches to the bobbin 8 (Fig. 5 and 6) and thereby the danger exists that windings are torn along. Therefore, the efforts of the expert were to avoid that due to collapse of the balloon the thread Y attaches to the cop 81 or on the bobbin 8, whereby increased friction occurs, which in turn leads to larger thread tensions. Due to this reason so far one worked always with small distances LF between the top of the reel tube 8 and the thread guide 6 by using balloon breaking devices 7 of most varied type. Thread tension peaks and also the tearing-off of windings are though reduced in this way and higher unwinding speeds are made possible, but this increase of production output follows at the costs of yarn quality,<br>
7<br><br>
so that limitations are set to the draw off speed.<br>
Surprisingly it could be now found that in a sufficiently large distance LF one can work without balloon breaking devices 7 and considerably higher draw off speeds can be achieved than with balloon breaking devices 7. Fig. 7 shows in comparison the thread breaks for a distance LF of 1000 mm. Through this kind of enlargement of the distance LF the thread breaks are reduced to 11 %, it means, that with this kind of considerable increase of the distance LF the thread breaks amount to only about 22% of the values which can be achieved by means of balloon breaking devices. At the same time, however, also the yarn quality is considerably improved. In the absence of friction at balloon breaking devices no significant wear due to friction occurs. Apparently also the observed position of the thread Y on the bobbin 8 particularly while unwinding of the cop base is of insignificant influence. Also the threatened tear along of windings, which certainly leads to thread break, gets obviously reduced. The unwinding conditions have been improved through a sufficient enlargement of the distance LF beyond 600 mm. This result surprises, since it was to be assumed that due to the placement of thread on the bobbin 8 friction occurs, which produces at least fluff and the thread become rough.<br>
For the unwinding conditions also the ratio of windings play no insignificant role. It was found out that in a winding ratio of upwards windings to downward windings of at least 1 : 2 the unwinding conditions with respect to thread breaks are considerably improved in relation to the usual winding ratios, in which in the reverse order the number of downward windings is smaller compared to the upward windings. Winding ratio herein means the number of windings, in which the thread Y is wound on the way from the foot side to the head side of the cop during spinning, compared with the number of windings, which the thread Y on the reverse way describes. The best results were achieved for example with a winding ratio of : 4. In this no more than 6 m of thread should be wound while winding on the cone. Preferably, approx. 4.5 m of thread is wound on a cone layer. A cone layer is formed during this from up and down movement of the winding. Also the height<br>
8<br><br>
of the cone plays a role for the process behavior of the feed reel 81. The height of the cone should not be less than 40 mm, however, it should also not be more than 90 mm. For example, a cone height of 60 mm has proved to be maximum beneficial. Thereby, the tearing along of yarn layers on the winding cone is considerably restricted.<br>
Thus the unwinding conditions are influenced already through the forming of the feed reel 81 on the ring spinning machine. It is known that harder reels can be rewound better. It has proved to appropriate, to wind the feed reel 81 under such a thread tension, that its hardness is at least 50° Shore. Optimum process behavior is apparent for example at 60° Shore. Through these measures during the forming of the feed reel 81 the thread unwind conditions while rewinding can be additionally influenced. However, winding ratio and/or reel hardness have no influence on the yarn roughening. This can be influenced by the distance LF alone.<br>
Complex trial series have confirmed that the optimum of the distance LF is in the range of about 1000 mm.<br>
Design-wise this open stretch LF can be implemented in most simple manner by the fact that the stand 10 of the winding station is replaced through a suitably extended stand 100 (Fig. 2). A suitable open stretch LF, however, allows to be represented in a different way, for example, through the arrangement of cop 81 to be unwound below or behind the winding machine. In Figure 8 the feed reels 81 are arranged with inclination on the rear side of the winding machine, where the feeding of the feed reels 81 normally takes place, so that the stretch LF stretches diagonally below the winding station. Thereby for the stand 101 there is lower height than for the stand 100.<br>
In the design according to Figure 8 the thread guide is designed as roller 61 (Fig. 12), so that due to the deflection the thread Y does not experience any damaging friction. The roller 61 is appropriately suspended as rotatable on roller bearings, so that it can<br>
9<br><br>
rotate as far as possible freely and is carried along by the thread Y only with lowest force effort, without being impacted by it. The roller 61 can be put in rotation instead of by the thread Y also by an external drive, so that also the friction due to pulling in case of drive through the thread Y does not occur. The roller 61 has a groove 62, which can be designed as u-shaped as well as v-shaped, to ensure better guiding und threading-in of the thread Y (Fig. 13).<br>
As is apparent from Figure 8, through the thread guide 61 a bending of the thread Y around the angle a is caused. Such a bending, even if it is 70° or more, has proved to be not damaging for the winding process, if the thread guide 6 is designed as free rotatable roller. For the design and development of the winding machine this knowledge, however, offers advantages, since no more the entire winding process need to take place in a single - more or less straight - thread running stretch. Without any problems also several deflecting thread guides 61 can be used, like for example what is apparent from Figure 9. This arrangement, where through a single feeder 13 for two machines the feed reels 81 are fed, makes it possible to arrange the feed reels in a level above the machines. Besides, this arrangement has the advantage that the respective optimum distance LF can be provided without restriction. This arrangement can be used also for winding machines of traditional design. Even retrofitting is possible, since the distance stretch LF can be arranged independent of the machine.<br>
Figure 10 shows another possible arrangement for the open stretch LF. The feed reels 81 are fed, as usual, under the winding machine. The open stretch LF is arranged vertical on the front side of the machine/ whereas the stretch with the splice device 3, thick spot catcher 4 and the thread tensioning device 5 is arranged horizontal. With this arrangement a low structure height is achieved and only one deflecting thread guide 61 is required.<br>
Figure 11 shows a design similar to that of Figure 9, however, the feed reels 81 are fed on the floor at the rear side of the winding machine. The empty winding tubes 8<br>
10<br><br>
run back on the front operating side of the winding machine. Also here the open stretch LF is arranged independent of the machine at the rear side, so that traditional winding machines can be refurbished. The thread guide 62, which defines the open stretch LF, is arranged as being adjustable and can be brought into the position 62', in order to provide, if required, a particular open stretch LF. This design can also be used as double sided, i.e. from the feeder 13 also feed reels 81 can be fed to a second winding machine, as shown in Figure 9 with overhead arrangement.<br>
The advantages of the invention based equipment are obvious: despite considerably increased drawing speed the yarn roughness in the balloon forming zone has practically halved. The thread breaks are clearly reduced. Even then one can do away with complicated thread balloon limiter. The productivity increases with improved yarn quality by 30 to 40%. Especially in case of compress spun yarns the invention has proved itself, because due to low hairiness the danger of thread breaks due to slipping layers is great in these yarns. In case of high drawing speeds of more than 1600 m/min, which were not practicable so far, the optimum distance LF has particularly clear effect.<br>

ABSTRACT<br>
A process and device are disclosed for rewinding thread feed spools produced on a ring spinning machine, the spools having a cone at their upper end that ends at the spool holder. The threads to be rewound are drawn overhead from the feed spools, joined and wound into a cross-wound bobbin. The usual gap between the top edge of the thread feed spool holder and the thread guide is considerably increased, so that the thread crosses a free section of more than 600 mm, and is not exposed to any further guidance in this section.<br>
