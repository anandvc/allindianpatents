COMPLETE SPECIFICATION [See Section 10]<br>
                             "Perfuming compostion"<br>
FIRMENICH  SA,  of  1,   route  des  Jeunes,   P.O.   Box  239,   1211   Geneva  8, Switzerland,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br><br>
17-04-2000	IB 009900890<br><br>
Slow release of fragrant compounds in perfumery using 2-benzoyl benzoates, 2-alkanoyl benzoates or a-keto esters<br>
5      1 echnical Field and Prior Art<br>
The present invention relates to the field of perfumery. It relates, more particularly, to perfuming compositions or perfumed products containing a class of aliphatic or aromatic keto esters of fragrant alcohols, as defined below, which are 10 capable of releasing said fragrant alcohol upon exposure to light, more particularly daylight. The present invention also relates to a-keto esters, as defined below, of alcohols which are precursors of fragrant aldehydes and ketones and which are capable of releasing said fragrant ketone or aldehyde upon exposure to light, more particularly daylight. Said a-keto esters may furthermore contain, in a-position to the keto group, an 15 alkyl group which may contain various substituents and which alkyl group is derived from a fragrant molecule possessing an olefinic unsaturation. The unsaturated molecule and/or the aldehyde or ketone are released upon exposure to light, in particular daylight, of the a-keto ester.<br>
Some compounds of the invention, namely some 2-benzoylbenzoate esters<br>
20     as well as some a-keto esters are known to be photolabile compounds. Therefore, it has<br>
been suggested in the prior art to use 2-benzoylbentoate esters as protective groups for<br>
alcohols in organic synthesis and subsequently release the alcohol present in the ester<br>
function by photolysis (see Porter et al., J. Org. Chem 1996, 67, 9455-9461). The<br>
authors  conducted experiments with different alcohols,  and they  described  the<br>
25     elimination of geraniol from the geranyl 2-benzoyl benzoate (R1=R2=R3=R4=R5=H).<br>
Moreover, S. Hu and D.C.Neckers in J. Org.  Chem.  1997,  62,  6820-6826,  and<br>
G.A. Kraus and Y. Wu in J.Am. Chem. Soc. 1992, 114, 8705-8707 disclose some<br>
a-keto ester derivatives within the scope of photolysis studies. On the other hand, some<br>
pyruvate esters are known to be active ingredients to enable the removal of amine and<br>
30     mercaptan type odors (Patent Abstracts of Japan, 1994, 18, 410). However, it has not<br>
been described or suggested in the prior art to use the said esters in perfumery, as<br>
fragrance delivery systems capable of releasing the fragrant alcohol over a prolonged<br>
period of time and thus provide a slow release fragrance effect.<br><br>
IB 009900890<br><br><br><br>
There exists, in perfumery, a particular interest in compounds which are<br>
capable  of "fixing"   fragrant  molecules,   for   example  by   chemical   bonding   or<br>
intramolecular forces like absorption, and releasing said fragrant molecules over a<br>
5     prolonged period of time, for example by the action of heat, enzymes, or even sunlight.<br>
Fragrant molecules have to be volatile in order to be perceived. Although many fragrant<br>
compounds are known which show a good substantivity, i.e. they will remain on a<br>
surface to which they have been applied for several days and can hence be perceived<br>
over such a period of time, a great number of fragrant compounds are very volatile, and<br>
10     their characteristic smell can no longer be perceived several hours after their application.<br>
It is thus desirable to dispose of fragrance delivery systems which are<br>
capable of releasing the fragrant compound or compounds in a controlled manner,<br>
maintaining a desired smell over a prolonged period of time.<br><br>
Accordingly, the present invention relates to a perfuming composition or perfumed article comprising, together with perfuming ingredients, solvents or adjuvants of the kind such as herein described in the preparation of perfume formulations, at least 0.01% of a 2-benzoyl benzoate or a 2-alkanoyl benzoate of formula<br><br><br>
(R2),<br><br>

or<br><br><br><br>
(I)<br><br>
(H)<br><br>
in which Ri represents hydrogen or a group of formula<br><br>
—CH—X<br>
in which X and Y can be identical or different and represent, independently from each other, hydrogen, a linear or branched alkyl or alkoxy group from C1 to C12, a phenyl group which is optionally substituted, an olefinic group from C2 to C12, an alcohol group, a CO2M group, a -NR6R7 group or a group of formula<br>
+<br><br><br>
or a polyalcohol or polyether group<br><br>
R2 can be identical to R1 or different from it and represents hydrogen, a linear or branched alkyl or alkoxy group from C1 to C12, a phenyl group which is optionally substituted, an olefinic group from C2 to C12, an alcohol group, a CO2M group, a -NR6R7 group, a group of formula<br><br><br>
R3 represents hydrogen, an alkyl or alkoxy group from C1 to C4, linear or<br>
branched, a OH group or a NH2 group;<br>
R4 and R5, taken separately, have the meaning given above for Ri and can be<br>
identical to or different from R1 or from each other ; or<br>
R4 and R5, taken together, form a bridging group between the two aromatic<br>
rings which bridging group can be a methylene or a keto group<br>
m is an integer from 0 to 3 and n is an integer from 0 to 2; R6 and R7, taken<br>
separately, each represents hydrogen, an alkyl group from C1 to C4, an<br>
alcohol group having an alkyl chain from C1 to C12, or a phenyl group, or, R4<br>
and R7, taken together with the nitrogen atom form a 5-membered or six-<br>
membered ring possibly containing another hetero atom<br>
Rs represents hydrogen, an alkyl group from C1 to C4, an alcohol group<br>
having an alkyl chain from C1to C12 or a phenyl group;<br>
M represents hydrogen or an alkali metal; and<br>
R* is the organic part derived from a primary or secondary fragrant alcohol<br>
R*OH.<br><br>
WO 99/60990<br><br><br><br>
R3 represents hydrogen, an alkyl or alkoxy group from C1 to C4, linear or branched, a<br>
OH group or a NH2 group ;<br>
R4 and R5, taken separately, have the meaning given above for R, and can be identical to<br>
or different from R1 or from each other ; or 5      R4 and R5, taken together, form a bridging group between the two aromatic rings, which<br>
bridging group can be a methylene or a keto group ;<br>
m is an integer from 0 to 3 and n is an integer from 0 to 2 ; R6 and R7, taken separately,<br>
each represent hydrogen, an alkyl group from C1 to C4, an alcohol group having an alkyl<br>
chain from C1 to C,12, or a phenyl group, or, R6 and R7 taken together with the nitrogen 10     atom form a 5-membered or six-membered ring possibly containing another hetero<br>
atom;<br>
R8 represents hydrogen, an alkyl group from C1 to C4, an alcohol group having an alkyl<br>
chain from C1 to C,2 or a phenyl group ;<br>
M represents hydrogen or an alkali metal; and 15      R* is the organic part derived from a primary or secondary fragrant alcohol R*OH.<br>
In the above definition, when reference is made to a fragrant alcohol, there<br>
is always meant an alcohol which not only has an odor, but which is also known to a<br>
person skilled in the art as being useful as perfuming ingredient for the formulation of<br>
perfumes or perfumed articles. The criteria a useful perfuming ingredient has to fulfil 20     are known to a person skilled in the art and include, amongst others, a certain originality<br>
of the odoriferous note, stability and a certain price/performance ratio. Non-limiting<br>
examples for fragrant alcohols which can be used with the benzoates of the invention<br>
will be mentioned below.<br>
From the above, it is clear that when reference is made to the organic part 25      R* of a fragrant alcohol R*OH, R* is the hydrocarbyl rest of said alcohol, e.g. a geranyl<br>
radical in case R*OH is geraniol.<br>
The advantage of the fragrance delivery system of the present invention lies<br>
in its capacity to slowly release the fragrant alcohols R*OH from which the benzoyl<br>
benzoate esters of formula (I) or the alkanoyl benzoate esters of formula (II) are derived. 30      The release occurs when said esters are exposed to daylight in particular.  Upon<br>
absorption of energy from said light, the ester undergoes a photoreaction in the course<br>
of which the fragrant alcohol is released from the molecule into the surroundings. Said<br><br>
WO 99/60990<br><br>
PCT/IB99/00890 <br>
release occurs in a controlled manner, i.e. a more or less constant amount of alcohol R*OH is formed over a period of time, without an initial burst of very intense odor which becomes rapidly imperceptible as is the case with volatile alcohols. Because the release of the alcohol R*OH can occur over several days or weeks, the use of the system 5 of the present invention obviates the drawbacks of many fragrant alcohols R*OH which are of pleasant smell but also very volatile. Good examples are citronellol and geraniol which can only be perceived over a short period of, say, one or two hours, when applied to the surface of, for example, tiles and windows in the course of a cleaning procedure using liquid cleaners ; even in solution, the typical smell of said alcohols disappears<br>
10 within several hours. It goes without saying that the concentration of the alcohols in the application plays an important role in the time during which the fragrant molecules can be perceived.<br>
With the system of the present invention, the typical odor of the alcohol R*OH is perceived over a considerably prolonged period of time, as the 2-benzoyl<br>
15 benzoate or the 2-alkanoyl benzoate of the fragrance delivery system, which are not or few volatile, remain as such on the surface to which they are applied or in the solution into which they are incorporated, and it is only upon exposure to light, that the fragrant alcohol R*OH is released. It is clear that this reaction can provide perceptible amounts of the alcohol over days or weeks, depending, amongst others, on the amount or the<br>
20 concentration of the fragrance delivery system, the time of exposure to light, its intensity and its wavelength.<br>
2-Benzoyl benzoate esters of the above formula (I) which can carry various substituents in positions R1 R2, R3, R4 and R5 are known to be photolabile compounds. It was suggested to use these esters as protective groups for alcohols in organic<br>
25 synthesis and subsequently release the alcohol present in the ester function by photolysis (see Porter et al., J. Org. Chem 1996, 61, 9455-9461). The authors conducted experiments with different alcohols, and they described the elimination of geraniol from the geranyl 2-benzoyl benzoate (R,=R2=R3=R4=R5=H). However, it has not been described or suggested to use the said esters in perfumery, as a fragrance delivery<br>
30 system which is capable of releasing the fragrant alcohol over a prolonged period of time and thus provide a slow release fragrance effect.<br><br>

As fragrant alcohol R*OH derived radical R* in the above formula (I), in<br>
principle a group derived from any fragrant alcohol which is known in the art can be<br>
used. Primary and secondary alcohols are shown to be useful in the present invention as<br>
they are liberated when exposed to daylight.<br>
5	As non-limiting examples of alcohols which can be used in the present<br>
invention in the form of the 2-benzoyl benzoate esters, one can cite anisic alcohol, cinnamic alcohol, fenchylic alcohol, 9-decen-l-ol, phenethylol, citronellol, 3-methyl-5-phenyl-1-pentanol (origin: Firmenich SA, Geneva, Switzerland), Mayol ® (7-p-menthan-1-ol; origin : Firmenich SA, Geneva, Switzerland), geraniol (3,7-dimethyl-<br>
10 2,6-octadien-l-ol), (Z)-3-hexen-l-ol, 1-hexanol, 2-hexanol, 5-ethyl-2-nonanol, 2,6-nonadien-1-ol, borneol, 1-octen-3-ol, cyclomethyl citronellol, decanol, dihydroeugenol, 8-p-menthanol, 3,7-dimethyl-l-octanol, dodecanol, eugenol, isoeugenol, Tarragol ® (2-methoxy-4-propyl-l-cylohexanol; origin: Firmenich SA, Geneva, Switzerland), Polysantol ® [(E)-3,3-dimethyl-5-(2',2',3'-trimethyl-3'-cyclopenten-l'-yl)-4-penten-2-ol;<br>
15 origin : Firmenich SA, Geneva, Switzerland] and Limbanol ® [l-(2',2',3',6'-tetramethyl-cyclohex-l-yl)-3-hexanol; origin : Firmenich SA, Geneva, Switzerland].<br>
It is quite obvious, however, that the process of the invention is perfectly general and can relate to many other alcohols which the skilled person is quite able to choose from the general knowledge in the art and as a function of the olfactive effect it<br>
20 is desired to achieve. The above list therefore is more illustrative for fragrant alcohols which are known to a person skilled in the art, and whose delivery can be improved, but it is clearly quite impossible to cite in an exhaustive manner all alcohols of formula R*OH which have a pleasant odor and the 2-benzoyl or 2-alkanoyl benzoate esters of which can be used in the fragrance delivery system of the present invention.<br>
25	From the foregoing, it is evident that the fragrance delivery system is<br>
particularly appropriate for delivering fragrant alcohols R*OH which are very volatile, or which have a low perception threshold, like geraniol, citronellol or phenethylol. The benzoyl and alkanoyl benzoate esters (I) of the latter are thus preferred according to the present invention.<br>
30	The chemical reaction which releases the fragrant alcohol can only occur<br>
when a source of a hydrogen radical He is present in the fragrance delivery system. It is believed that in the first reaction step, said hydrogen radical is transferred to the oxygen<br><br>
WO 99/60990<br><br>
PCT/IB99/00890<br><br>
of the keto-function. Such a source can be intramolecular, i.e. the hydrogen radical comes from the 2-benzoyl benzoates of formula (I) or the 2-alkanoyl benzoates of formula (II) themselves, or intermolecular, i.e. the hydrogen radical comes from another, different source which is present in the medium in which the ester is 5 incorporated. The intramolecular pathway or mechanism is a universal mechanism which can occur in every possible application medium, thus in the liquid or solid state. The intermolecular mechanism, however, is only possible in solution, but not in the solid state. Non-limiting examples of liquid state application media are liquid air-fresheners which release the fragrant alcohol upon exposure to light. Examples of<br>
10 release of the fragrant alcohol in the solid state are surfaces, like those of tiles or windows, which are cleaned with a cleaner containing the fragrance delivery system of the invention, the system being thus deposited on the surface after cleaning and remaining on it as a solid film after evaporation of the liquids present in the cleaner. However, it has to be understood that the term "solid" as used beforehand is used to<br>
15 designate the benzoates in the neat state in which they may be a real solid, crystalline or non-crystalline, or be in the form of a more or less viscous oil.<br>
For the 2-benzoyl benzoates of the above formula (I) or the 2-alkanoyl benzoates of the above formula (II) in which R1, R4 and R5 are hydrogen, an external hydrogen radical source is necessary. In general, the hydrogen radical will be abstracted<br>
20 from the solvent in which the 2-benzoyl or the 2-alkanoyl benzoate is dissolved or provided by a solvent which is added to the solution containing the said compound. Suitable sources are known to a person skilled in the art. The most important criterion a suitable hydrogen radical source has to fulfil is that a stable radical is formed after abstraction of the hydrogen. For a given compound, and independently from other<br>
25 functional groups or structural elements present in the same, the presence of hydrocarbon groups which are not methyl or tert-butyl is very favorable towards the formation of a stable radical after hydrogen abstraction. Suitable groups include ethyl or n-propyl. Even better are branched secondary alkyl groups, like isopropyl or sec-butyl. It is preferred when the solvent contains an isopropyl group or is a primary or secondary<br>
30 alcohol. Non-limiting examples for classes of solvents are the following: aliphatic and aromatic alcohols, like methanol, ethanol, propanol, decanol or benzyl alcohol, in particular     isopropanol ;     diols     and     polyols,     like     ethyleneglycol,     glycerol,<br><br>
WO 99/60990<br><br>
PCT/IB99/00890 <br><br>
polyethyleneglycol, propyleneglycol or polypropyleneglycol ; ketones, such as diisopropylketone; esters, such as isopropylacetate; aromatic solvents, such as ethylbenzene, cyclohexylbenzene or isopropylbenzene (cumene), di- or triisopropylbenzene; ethers, such as diisopropylether, tetrahydrofxjran, mono-, di- or 5 triethyleneglycoldimethylether, diethyleneglycolmonoether or polyethyleneglycol-dimethylether ; aminoalcohols, such as mono-, di- or triethanolamine ; hydrocarbons, in particular branched hydrocarbons, including limonene.<br>
Preferred solvents include primary and secondary alcohols, in particular<br>
isopropanol, 1-dodecanol, 2-tridecanol, butanol or amyl alcohol.<br>
10	All the above-mentioned solvents can, of course, also be used for benzoyl<br>
and alkanoyl benzoate esters which react in an intramolecular pathway to release the fragrant alcohol. In such case, R1, R4 or R5 are the intramolecular hydrogen radical source, as will be described below.<br>
The mentioned solvents will be chosen according to their ability to release 15      hydrogen radicals.<br>
We have found that the intramolecular pathway for the release of the fragrant alcohol only occurs when at least one of the groups R1 R4 or R5 of formula (I) or (II),which is in 2-position relative to the keto function, is a group of formula<br><br>
—CH-x<br>
20	Y<br>
from which the hydrogen radical is easily transferred to the keto function, due to the vicinity of the group R, to the keto function by which an energetically favorable<br>
transition state is possible. X and Y are chosen to stabilize the resulting radical<br>
25<br>
•<br>
—C—X<br>
I<br>
Y<br>
which remains after abstraction of the hydrogen radical and its transfer to the keto function. Suitable groups X and Y which can stabilize radicals are known to a person 30 skilled in the art, and X and Y, which can be the same or different, will be chosen according to the respective benzoyl benzoate and the fragrant alcohol R*OH used in a given fragrance delivery system in order to give the best results, i.e. the desired release<br><br>
WO 99/60990<br><br>
PCT/IB99/00890 <br>
rate for the fragrant alcohol. Preferably X and Y are, independently from each other, a group as defined above with respect to formulae (I) and (II).<br>
The compounds of formula (I) can contain, in addition to the substituent R, in 2-position of the cycle relative to the keto function, a further substituent R4 in 5 6-position. It is evident that this substituent R4 can also function as a hydrogen radical source, after a rotation around the single bond between the keto function and the phenyl ring. Moreover, the same applies to the group R5 of the above formula (I) or (II), which is optionally present in the phenyl ring which carries the ester function. R5, after a rotation of the phenyl group, can also serve as a hydrogen radical source. R4 and R5 thus<br>
10 have the same meaning as R1, which has-been defined above, and R4 and R5 can be identical to R1, or they can be different from R1, and, respectively, from each other.<br>
The two phenyl groups of the 2-benzoyl benzoates or formula (I) can furthermore be bridged by a methylene or keto group.<br>
We have furthermore found that it can be advantageous with respect to the<br>
15 release of the fragrant alcohol when the respective benzoyl benzoate of formula (I) or the respective alkanoyl benzoate of formula (II) carries a substituent R3 other than hydrogen in the ortho-position to the -COOR*- function. The purpose of this substituent is to establish a favorable conformation of the -COOR*- function relative to the keto group, or respectively to the reduced keto-group, in order to facilitate the cyclization to<br>
20 the lactone which occurs after release of the alcohol. This reaction leads to the release of the fragrant alcohol R*OH. Practically, any group which is inert towards the -COOR*-function can be used, and they are known to a person skilled in the art. The groups defined in the above formula (I) and (II), namely linear or branched alkyl or alkoxy from C1, to C4, OH or NH2 have revealed themselves as being appropriate from the point<br>
25      of view of effectiveness, and, of course, synthetic access.<br>
The benzoyl benzoates of formula (I) and the alkanoyl benzoate of formula (II) can furthermore carry one or more substituents R2 in the positions indicated and defined above. Substituents R2, however, seem to be of less importance to the reactivity and the performance of the fragrance delivery system of the present invention,<br>
30 although it is often preferred, for reasons of easy accessibility of the corresponding 2-benzoyl and 2 -alkanoyl benzoates of the invention, to use an ester wherein R, is a group other than hydrogen. It is however possible to adapt e.g. the stability of the<br><br>
WO 99/60990	PCT/IB99/008902-benzoyl and 2 -alkanoyl benzoates of the present invention to the respective application desired. The 2-benzoyl benzoates can e.g. be rendered more hydrophilic by one or more groups R2 which are a quaternary amine group, a polyalcohol group or a polyether group. Specific examples for said functional groups are known to a person 5     skilled in the art, and the groups will be chosen according to the effect desired.<br>
Preferred 2-benzoyl benzoate esters of the present invention are those of formula<br>
  (I')<br>
10      in which<br>
R1, is a branched alkyl group from C3 to C4 containing a secondary hydrocarbon group ;<br>
R2 is a branched alkyl group from C3, to C4, and is identical to R1 ;<br>
R3 is hydrogen or a linear or branched alkyl group from C1, to C4;<br>
R4 is hydrogen or a linear or branched alkyl group from C1, to C4; 15     R5 is hydrogen or a linear or branched alkyl group from C1, to C4;<br>
R* is the organic part derived from a primary or secondary fragrant alcohol R*OH.<br>
Generally, with respect to the above formulae (I) and (T), it can be said that<br>
it is preferred when R1 R4 or R5 which are responsible for the transfer of the hydrogen<br>
radical towards the keto function, is an isopropyl group, irrespective of the other 20     substituents which may be present in the molecule. The isopropyl group was found to be<br>
the substituent which is most easily available, from a synthetic point of view, and which<br>
readily transfers hydrogen to the keto function, which we attribute to its ability to form a<br>
stable radical after abstraction of hydrogen.<br>
The most preferred compounds according to the above formula (I') are 25      geranyl 2-(2'-isopropylbenzoyl)benzoate, geranyl 2-(2',4'-diisopropyl-benzoyl)benzoate<br>

The 2-benzoyl and 2-alkanoyl benzoates of the present invention are synthesized by esterification of the respective 2-benzoyl and 2-alkanoyl benzoic acids with the desired alcohol, in a way known to a person skilled in the art, preferably using 4-dimethylaminopyridine in pyridine and 1,3-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide. The above-5 mentioned benzoic acids are obtained from the respective phthalic anhydride. This latter is brought to reaction, for example, with the desired substituted or unsubstituted benzene in a Friedel-Crafts reaction. If necessary, the respective phthalic anhydride can also be reacted with the Grignard reagent, the organolithium compound or another appropriate organometallic compound of the desired substituted or unsubstituted 10      benzene or alkane, respectively.<br>
A further object of the present invention is a fragrance delivery system <br><br>
ά-keto esters of formula<br>
comprising <br>
(III) 15 <br>
in which<br>
R'* is hydrogen or a linear or branched, unsubstituted or substituted alkyl group or<br>
alkylene group from C1 to C35, an unsubstituted or substituted cycloalkyl group from C3,<br>
to C8, an unsubstituted or substituted phenyl group, wherein said alkyl, alkylene, 20     cycloalkyl and phenyl groups may comprise one or several hetero atoms not directly<br>
linked to the a-keto group and selected from the group consisting of oxygen, nitrogen,<br>
phosphorous and sulfur, or<br>
R'*  is a substituted or unsubstituted, linear or branched alkyl group carrying an<br>
abstractable hydrogen in y-position relative to the a-keto function and comprising a 25      moiety from which is derived a fragrant compound containing an olefin function, such<br>
that said fragrant compound containing an olefin function is eliminated after abstraction<br>
of said γ-hydrogen atom ;<br>
R"* is hydrogen or a methyl, ethyl or tert-butyl group or is the organic part of a primary<br>
or secondary alcohol from which is derived a fragrant aldehyde or ketone, and 30      at least one of the groups R'* and R"* being a group which is derived from a fragrant<br>
compound.<br><br>
WO 99/60990<br><br>
PCT/IB99/00890<br><br>
In the above definition, when reference is made to a fragrant compound, aldehyde or ketone, it is always meant a compound which not only has an odor, but which is also known to a person skilled in the art as being useful as a perfuming ingredient for the formulation of perfumes or perfumed articles. The criteria a useful 5 perfuming ingredient has to fulfil are known to a person skilled in the art and include, amongst others, a certain originality of the odoriferous note, stability and a certain price/performance ratio. Non-limiting examples for fragrant compounds which can be used with the a-keto esters of the invention will be mentioned below.<br>
Like the above-described 2-benzoyl benzoates and 2-alkanoyl benzoates, the<br>
10 a-keto esters of the above formula (III) release fragrant compounds upon exposure to light, in particular daylight. The a-keto esters of formula (III), however, are capable of releasing a fragrant compound containing an olefin function from the group R'* in 1-position relative to the keto function, or a fragrant aldehyde or ketone which is derived from the alcohol R"*OH from which the organic part R"* is present in the ester function<br>
15     of the keto esters of the present invention, or even both.<br>
From the above, it is clear that when reference is made to the organic part R"* of a fragrant alcohol R"*OH, R"* is the hydrocarbyl rest of said alcohol, e.g. a menthyl radical in case R"*OH is menthol.<br>
The release of the fragrant compound from the keto esters occurs in an<br>
20 elimination reaction after an intramolecular transfer of an abstractable hydrogen radical, in γ-position to the a-keto function, to said keto function. The respective part of the molecule from which the hydrogen radical has been abstracted is subsequently released from the reduced keto ester, with concomitant formation of a double bond. The above is illustrated in the scheme below in which possible substituents in the respective parts of<br>
25 the molecules have been omitted for reasons of clarity. The double bonds which will be formed after elimination are indicated by dotted lines.<br><br><br>
WO 99/60990	PCT/1B99/00890It is to be understood that the a-keto esters of the present invention can release only one or both molecules of fragrant compound per molecule of a-keto ester. When the hydrogen transfer to the a-keto function is able to occur from the one or the other side of said function, as illustrated above, a certain part of the molecules will 5 release a ketone or aldehyde and a certain part will release the olefin compound. The proportions of the two products released depend on the relative rate of each hydrogen transfer reaction. According to the effect desired, the a-keto esters of the invention can be tailored to release exclusively a fragrant ketone or aldehyde, or exclusively a fragrant compound containing an olefin group, or both. When only one of the two classes of<br>
10 fragrant compounds is to be released from the a-keto esters of the invention, the part of the molecule from which no release shall occur does not contain an abstractable hydrogen atom in y-position to the keto function, i.e. either no hydrogen atom at all is present in the said position, or it is one which is not abstracted.<br>
It is also clear that the a-keto esters according to the invention can, in a first<br>
15 step, release the olefin compound under formation of a molecule which does not any longer contain an abstractable hydrogen atom in y-position to the keto function (left side of the molecule as designed above); in a second step, this molecule can then release the ketone or aldehyde from the ester function.<br>
It is evident that a fragrance delivery system which contains the a-keto<br>
20 esters of the above formula (III) has all the advantages described above for the 2-benzoyl and 2-alkanoyl benzoates of formula (I) and (II), i.e. the release of the fragrant compound occurs in a more or less constant amount. No initial burst of very intensive odor which becomes imperceptible after a relatively short period of time occurs, as is often observed with volatile aldehydes or ketones or fragrant compounds containing an<br>
25 olefin group. With the a-keto esters of the present invention, such disadvantages are obviated because the esters will remain on a surface to which they have been applied or in the solution into which they have been incorporated. Upon exposure to light, the fragrant compound or compounds are released, and this reaction can provide perceptible amounts of the compound over days or weeks, depending, amongst others, on the<br>
30 amount or the concentration of the a-keto esters, the time of exposure to light and its intensity.<br><br>
WO 99/60990<br><br>
PCT/IB99/00890<br><br><br>
A further advantage of the a-keto esters according to formula (III) is the protection of the reactive, unstable aldehyde or keto function in the molecules to be released against degradation which may occur during storage.<br>
Additionally, the a-keto esters of the present invention allow for the 5      generation   of mixtures   of two   different   fragrant   compounds,   and   in   different proportions, if desired.<br>
In principle, any fragrant aldehyde or ketone which is known in the art can be released from the a-keto esters of the invention in which they are chemically bound in the form of the ester of their corresponding secondary or primary alcohol.<br>

With respect to the fragrant compounds carrying an olefin group, in principle any compound containing such olefin group and, in addition, any osmophoric<br>
25 group known in perfumery can be used. As non-limiting examples for osmophoric groups, one can cite alcohol, ether, ester, aldehyde and keto groups, the thio analogues of the said groups, nitrile, nitro and olefin groups.<br>
As non-limiting examples for fragrant compounds which carry an olefin group,   there   can   be   cited   linalool,    1,3,5-undecatrienes,    myrcene,    myrcenol,<br>
30 dihydromyrcenol, nerolidol, sinensals, limonene, carvone, farnesenes, isopentyrate (1,3-dimethyI-3-butenyl isobutyrate ; origin : Firmenich SA, Geneva, Switzerland), ally I 3-<br><br>

methylbutoxyacetate, eugenol, Rosalva ® (9-decen-l-ol; origin : International Flavors &amp;<br>
Fragrances, USA), and allyl heptanoate.<br>
It is quite obvious, however, that the invention is perfectly general and can<br>
relate to many other aldehydes, ketones and olefins which are useful as fragrant 5      compounds. The person skilled in the art is quite able to choose these compounds from<br>
the general knowledge in the art and from the olfactive effect it is desired to achieve.<br>
The above list is therefore more illustrative for the compounds which are known to a<br>
person skilled in the art, and whose delivery can be improved. It is clearly quite<br>
impossible to cite in an exhaustive manner all aldehydes, ketones and olefins which 10     have a pleasant odor and which can be used in the form of derivatives in the a-keto<br>
esters of formula (III) from which they are released upon exposure to light.<br>
The a-keto esters of the present invention are in particular appropriate for<br>
delivering fragrant aldehydes, ketones and fragrant compounds containing an olefin<br>
group which are very volatile or which have a low perception threshold. Preferred 15     aldehydes and ketones include citronellal, citral, hydroxycitronellal, Hedione ®, Lilial ®,<br>
raspberry ketone, anisaldehyde, menthone, Delphone, Orivone®, 2-naphthalenyl-l-<br>
ethanone, and aldehydes from C6 to C!3, saturated or unsaturated linear or branched.<br>
Preferred fragrant compounds containing an olefin group include linalool, myrcene,<br>
myrcenol and Rosalva ®.<br>
In case the a-keto esters of the present invention are used to release<br>
exclusively aldehydes or ketones, the group R'* is hydrogen, phenyl, cyclohexyl or<br>
cyclopentyl, methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl, sec-butyl, isobutyl or tert-butyl, i.e.<br>
groups which do not provide an abstractable hydrogen atom in y-position to the a-keto<br>
function or which do not form a stable radical when a hydrogen radical is abstracted 25     from them. In the latter case, small amounts of olefin may be formed which however do<br>
not interfere with the aldehyde or ketone released.<br>
Likewise, when the a-keto esters of the present invention are used to release<br>
a fragrant compound containing an olefin group only, then the group R"* will be<br>
hydrogen or a methyl, ethyl or tert-butyl group, thus a group which does not provide an 30     abstractable proton in y-position to the a-keto function or which do not form a stable<br>
radical when a hydrogen radical is abstracted from them.<br><br>
WO 99/60990<br><br>
PCT/IB99/00890<br><br>
It is preferred when the fragrance delivery system of the present invention<br>
contains a-keto esters of formula (III) in which R"* is the organic part of a primary or<br>
secondary alcohol from which is derived a fragrant aldehyde or ketone and in which R'*<br>
is a phenyl, cyclohexyl or cyclopentyl group or a linear or branched alkyl group from C1,<br>
5      to C4.<br>
A fragrance delivery system containing the a-keto esters of formula (III)<br>
does not need an external hydrogen radical source. A fragrance delivery system<br>
containing a-keto esters of the present invention may thus comprise a solvent the choice<br>
of which is not supposed to be critical. Suitable classes of solvents include alcohols,<br>
10     ethers, esters, ketones, amines and aminoalcohols.<br>
Depending on the general application conditions or on the product into<br>
which the a-keto esters according to the present invention are incorporated, one can<br>
sometimes also observe the release of alcohols R"*OH, due to saponification of the<br>
ester function, or due to reduction of the aldehyde or ketone formed by irradiation.<br>
15	The a-keto esters of formula (III) can be prepared, on the one hand, by<br>
esterification of the respective a-ketoacids with the primary or secondary alcohols which are the precursors of the fragrant aldehydes and ketones to be releasead. Another way for the preparation of the a-keto esters of the present invention is the reaction of the bis(oxalyl) ester of the primary or secondary precursor alcohol R"*OH with the 20 Grignard compound of the appropriate group R'* as defined in formula (III). The reaction is illustrated in the scheme I below.<br>
Scheme I<br>
25 The bis(oxalyl) ester is prepared from oxalyl chloride and the desired alcohol, see Synth. Commun. 1981, (11), 943-946 and Org. Synth. Coll. Vol. II 1943,<br>
425-427.<br><br>
WO 99/60990<br><br>
PCT/IB99/0089 <br><br><br><br>
Another synthetic route leading to the desired a-keto esters of formula (III) is the Grignard reaction of the readily available bis(oxalyl)esters of lower aliphatic alcohols such as, for example, methanol, ethanol or propanol, with the Grignard compound of the respective group R'*, resulting in the intermediate ester (IV). This said ester (IV) is then submitted to a transesterification reaction with the respective precursor alcohol R"*OH, to give the desired a-keto ester. This reaction is outlined in the following scheme II in which R'* and R"* have the meaning defined in formula (III). Hal is CI, Br or I and R is a lower alkyl group such as, for example, methyl, ethyl, propyl or butyl.<br>
Scheme II<br><br>
Various a-keto esters of formula (III) in which R'* is hydrogen or a phenyl<br>
or methyl group and R"* is derived from the alcohol precursor of a fragrant aldehyde are described in the literature.<br>
Also known is hexyl (cyclohexyl)oxoacetate (see DE-OS 29 09 951 to Bayer AG, describing the use of the said compound as starting product for the synthesis<br>
20     of catalysts for the polymerisation of olefins), which would release n-hexanal upon irradiation.<br>
In Biochem. Z. 1935, (277), p 426-436, there is described the synthesis of the (-)-bornyl ester of (4-methylphenyI)oxoacetic acid, i.e. (-) (IS,2R), 1,7,7-trimethylbicyclo[2.2.1]heptan-2-yl   (4-methylphenyl)oxoacetate.   The   compound   is<br>
25      characterized by its physical data.<br>
There are furthermore known, from the chemical literature, various compounds according to the above formula (III) wherein OR"* is a menthyl or a benzyl group, with the groups R'* being various alkyl, alkenyl, cycloalkyl or phenyl groups as defined above.<br><br>
WO 99/60990<br><br>
PCT/IB99/00890<br><br>
There is nowhere found, however, any description or hint concerning the value of the compounds according to formula (III) in perfumery as a photosensitive molecule which will release a fragrant compound upon irradiation.<br>
In the book of S.  Arctander,  Perfume and Flavors  Chemicals,   1969,<br>
5      Montclair, New Jersey, USA, there are mentioned decyl 2-oxopropanoate, (Z)-3-<br>
hexenyl 2-oxopropanoate and 2-ethyl-3-methylbutyl 2-oxopropanoate, with a short<br>
description of their odor and their synthesis. It is not mentioned that the said molecules<br>
release fragrant compounds upon irradiation.<br>
The release of the above-mentioned fragrant compounds from the delivery<br>
10 system occurs upon the exposure to light, e.g. the normal daylight which can penetrate through ordinary windows in houses and which is not particularly rich in UV-radiation. It goes without saying that upon exposure to bright sunlight, in particular outdoors, the release of the fragrant alcohol, aldehyde, ketone or alkene will occur faster and to a greater extent than upon exposure to the light in a room inside a building. Of course, the<br>
15 reaction which releases the fragrant compound from the delivery system can also be initiated by an appropriate artificial lamp.<br>
The fragrance delivery systems of the present invention can be used in any application in which a prolonged, defined release of the above-mentioned fragrant compounds is desired. They therefore mostly find use in functional perfumery, in<br>
20 articles which are exposed to daylight when in use or which are applied to other articles which thereafter are exposed to daylight. Suitable examples include air-fresheners in liquid and solid form which, with the delivery system of the present invention, still can release a fragrance when conventional air-fresheners, i.e. those not containing the system of the present invention, are exhausted. Other examples are various cleaners for<br>
25 the cleaning of surfaces of all kinds, e.g. window and household cleaners, all purpose-cleaners and furniture polish. The surfaces which have been cleaned with such cleaners will diffuse the smell of the perfume much longer than when cleaned with conventional cleaners. Other representative examples include detergents for fabric wash, fabric conditioners and fabric softeners which can also contain the delivery system of the<br>
30 present invention and which products can be in the form of powders, liquids or tablets. The fabrics and clothes washed or treated with such detergents or softeners will diffuse<br><br>
WO 99/60990<br><br>
PCT/IB99/00890<br><br><br>
the fragrant compound even after having been stored for weeks or even months, in a dark place, like a wardrobe.<br>
The release of the fragrant compound occurs in all the above-mentioned<br>
application examples. All possible types of window, household, all-purpose cleaners,<br>
5      air-fresheners, detergent, fabric wash and fabric softeners can be used with the fragrance<br>
delivery system of the present invention, which has revealed itself to be useful in all<br>
types of these above-mentioned application examples.<br>
In the field of body care, the delivery systems according to the present invention have shown themselves to be particularly appropriate for an application in the<br>
10 hair care area, and specific examples include shampoos, hair conditioners, in particular leave- in conditioners, hairspray and other hair care products.<br>
It can be said that generally all products which can be applied to a surface which is exposable to light may contain the system of the present invention. Examples include surfaces which belong to the human body, like skin or hair, surfaces in buildings<br>
15 and apartments, like floors, windows, tiles or furniture, or surfaces of fabrics, e.g. clothes. It is clear that the system of the invention can also be used to release fragrances from liquids, like in liquid air-fresheners. The possible applications of this type, however, appear to be less general than the application on the various surfaces mentioned.<br>
20	Of course, the above examples are only illustrative and non-limiting as<br>
referring to preferred embodiments. All other current articles in functional and fine perfumery may contain the system of the present invention, and these articles include soaps, bath or shower gels, cosmetic preparations, body deodorants, and even perfumes or colognes.<br>
25	In the above-cited applications, the device of the present invention can be<br>
used alone or with other perfuming ingredients, solvents and adjuvants of current use in the art. The nature and variety of these co-ingredients does not require a detailed description which, moreover could not be exhaustive, and a person skilled in the art will be able to choose said coingredients by his general knowledge and in function of the<br>
30 nature of the product to be perfumed and the olfactive effect sought. These perfuming ingredients belong to such varied chemical classes as alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, esters, ethers, acetates, nitriles, terpene hydrocarbons, nitrogen- or sulfur- containing<br><br>
WO 99/60990<br><br><br><br>
PCT/IB99/00890<br><br>
heterocyclic compounds, as well as essential oils of natural or synthetic origin. By way<br>
of example, embodiments of compounds can be found in standard reference works, such<br>
as the book of S. Arctander, Perfume and Flavor Chemicals, 1969, Montclair, New<br>
Jersey, USA, or more recent versions thereof, or in other works of similar nature.<br>
5	The proportions in which the system of the present invention can be<br>
incorporated in the various above-mentioned products vary within a wide range of values. These values depend on the nature of the fragrant compound to be released, the nature of the article or product which is to be perfumed and the desired olfactive effect, as well as on the nature of the co-ingredients in a given composition when the system of 10 the present invention is used in admixture with perfuming co-ingredients, solvents or adjuvants of current use in the art.<br>
By way of example, one can cite typical concentrations of the order of 0.01<br>
to 5%, or even 10% by weight relative to the weight of the consumer products cited<br>
above into which it is incorporated. Higher concentrations than those mentioned above<br>
15      can be used when the system is applied in perfuming compositions, perfumes or<br>
colognes.<br>

B.	Photorelease Assays<br>
10<br>
Photorelease assays were conducted on solutions (typical concentrations = 0.005 to 0.01 M) or films of the respective esters in 10 ml borosilicate glass volumetric flasks (Pyrex ®) unless otherwise stated. The films were prepared by dissolving the ester in a small (
15      drying under a stream of nitrogen or reduced pressure while rotating the flask to evenly disperse the ester on the surface of the glass. The samples were not degassed. The Fadeometer assays were done using an Atlas Ci35 Fadeometer, equipped with a borosilicate glass inner filter and a soda lime outer filter, set at 0.35 W/m2 at 340 nm. Natural light assays were done by putting the samples in a metal rack outdoors during<br>
20 daylight hours. Natural light conditions could also be mimicked by using a 8W 366 nm UV lamp with an intensity of 500 μW/cm2 (VWR Scientific Products).<br>
Analysis<br>
25 After photolysis, the quantity of alcohol released was measured by GC analysis of duplicate samples using the alcohol as the external standard. The presence of photoreleased alcohol was checked using GC retention times, GC-MS and also by smelling the samples. The ester solutions were injected neat while the solid films were dissolved and diluted volumetrically to 10 ml in acetone. Samples (1 (μl, split   54:1,<br>
30 injector at 250°C) were injected as acetone solutions. Gas chromatography-flame ionization detection (GC-FID) was carried out using an SPB-1 capillary column (30 m, 250 μm id. 0,25 μm film. Me carrier gas, 1.0 ml/min).<br><br>

Example 1<br>
Preparation of substituted 2-benzoyl benzoates<br>
a)    Geranyl 2-(2'-isopropylbenzoyl)benzoate (2)<br>
20	Magnesium (0.46 g, 19 mmol) and a crystal of iodine were placed in a dry round<br>
bottom flask which was heated to activate the magnesium. Diethyl ether was added to cover the magnesium (50 ml) and several drops of 2-iodoisopropyl benzene in diethyl ether were added to start the preparation of the Grignard reagent. When the latter was underway, a solution of 2-iodoisopropyl benzene (4.18 g, 17 mmol) in<br>
25	diethyl ether (20 ml) was added over 20 minutes. The reaction mixture was stirred<br>
for another 15 minutes and then refluxed for 20 minutes. Phthalic anhydride (3.11 g, 21 mmol) in toluene (50 ml) was added dropwise to the Grignard reagent at room temperature. The reaction temperature was raised to 60°C and the diethyl ether removed by evaporation. The reaction was allowed to stir at 60°C for 6 hours.<br>
30	The reaction mixture was poured on ice and 10% HC1 (100 ml) and extracted twice<br>
with diethyl ether. The organic phase was washed twice with a 10% Na2CO3 solution (200 ml). The aqueous phase was acidified with acetic acid (120 ml) and<br><br>

Release of geraniol from geranyl 2-(2',4'-diisopropylbenzoyl)benzoate in an all-purpose<br>
cleaner 20<br>
An all-purpose cleaner of the Fabuloso ® (registered trademark of Colgate-Palmolive,<br>
USA) type containing 0.3% of geranyl 2-(2',4'-diisopropylbenzoyl)benzoate was prepared.<br>
The all-purpose cleaner solution thus obtained was added to borosilicate flasks which were<br>
then irradiated for 3 hours in outdoor sunlight. The resulting solutions were then compared 25      to the unperfumed all-purpose cleaner base, on a triangular blind test by a panel composed<br>
of 15 non-experts. The odd sample was the one containing the above precursor molecule.<br>
The evaluation was carried out by sniffing on the flask.<br>
From the  15 test persons,  14 correctly distinguished the perfumed sample from the<br>
unperfumed sample.  They found that the odor note of the irradiated sample was floral.<br><br>

PCT/IB99/00890<br><br><br>
geraniol, citrus or citronellal, whereas the non-irradiated sample was found to be neutral, odorless or slightly oily.<br>
When the odd sample was the one containing the unperfumed cleaner base, 10 of 15 panelists correctly distinguished the samples. 5      The release of geraniol from the 2-benzoyl benzoate used in the present embodiment and from the other benzoates synthesized occurrred in all types of all-purpose cleaners and is therefore not restricted to one type of these.<br>

The liquid was allowed to evaporate, and the tiles were exposed to sunlight for 7 h in a covered petri dish. The tiles were then olfactively compared to tiles treated in the same way with the unperfumed cleaner base and exposed to sunlight on the same day and the same hours, on a triangular blind test by a panel composed of 15 non-experts, by sniffing on the petri dish. 30 When the odd sample was the one containing the title compound. 14 of 15 panelists correctly distinguished the perfumed sample from the unperfumed sample. When the odd<br><br>

6 ml of the respective base, i.e. a standard type window cleaner, or a Fabuloso® (registered  trademark  of Colgate-Palmolive,   USA)  type  all-purpose  cleaner,  and agitating until the solution became clear. For each irradiation series four samples were prepared for each compound, one of which, wrapped in aluminium foil, served as reference. All the samples were irradiated for 3, 6, or 15 h with either the Xenon or the UV lamp or exposed to outdoor sunlight. In all cases the formation of citronellal or menthone could be smelled after the photolysis. In order to quantify the amount of aldehyde or ketone (and of the remaining starting material) in the application base, the irradiated samples were subjected to GC analysis (extraction and on-column injection). For analysis, 1 g of NaCI was added and the samples were extracted with 3 ml of a 0.35 mM (50 mg/1) solution of undecane (used as internal standard) in iso-octane. The aqueous layer was re-extracted with 2 ml of the wo-octane solution and the two organic phases were combined and injected directly onto a GC column. The results obtained for the different bases are summarized in Table 8.<br>

Dynamic headspace analysis in all purpose cleaners (APC)<br>
5 In order to follow the perfume release under more realistic application conditions, quantitative dynamic headspace analyses were carried out. The formation of citronellal from its precursor in an APC application was compared to the behaviour of free citronellal in the same base. Solutions of a base of the Fabuloso ® type containing either 0.3 mass-% of citronellal precursor 13 or 0.3 mass-% of pure citronellal (≈ 2 molar<br>
10 equivalents) were prepared and deposed in self-built 3.5 1 Pyrex® glass containers covered with a thin window glass plate. The chambers were exposed to outdoor sunlight for 6 h and continuously flushed with an air stream. Every hour the volatiles contained in the air stream were adsorbed on a Tenax cartridge (during 15 min) and the light intensity was measured. The amount of citronellal trapped on the cartridges was<br>
15     desorbed and quantified by GC analysis and are summarized in Table 9.<br><br>
20<br><br>
The amount of citronellal released increases with increasing light intensity and decreases when the intensity decreases, with the maximum of release being obtained shortly after the maximum of irradiation was measured. The amount of free citronellal, however, was found to decrease steadily with increasing time and, no dependency on the light intensity was observed.<br><br><br><br>

The above described experiment was repeated using 0.3 mass-% of menthone precursor 18 or 0.15 mass-% of pure menthone (≈ 1 molar equivalent) in an APC application of the Fabuloso ® type. Again a dependency of perfume release of the irradiation intensity could be observed, see Table 10, whereas the amount of unprotected menthone decreased continuously over time. Working with molar equivalents instead of mass equivalents shows that the perfume concentration of both systems are in the same order of magnitude. At the beginning of the experiment the concentration of unprotected menthone is about three times stronger than the concentration of the perfume released from the precursor. At the end of the experiment the perfume released from the keto ester contributes more strongly than the free menthone.<br>

conditioner of the standard type was sprayed four times on a hair curl (≈ 5 g weight) and irradiated in a glass tube for 3 h with a Xenon lamp. The hair curl had been washed beforehand with an unperfumed shampoo base and the amount of conditioner deposed on the hair was weighed precisely. A comparison experiment with 0.1 mass-% (≈ 1 5 molar equivalent) of unprotected citronellal in the same base was carried out under identical conditions.<br>
During   irradiation,  the  glass  tube  was  connected  to  a  charcoal   filter  (for  air decontamination) and a Tenax cartridge and continuously flushed with an air stream<br>
10 (80 ml/min, corresponding to 4 renewals of air/sampling). The diffusion of citronellal was monitored over a period of three hours and four samplings at t = 0, 1,2 and 3 h were carried out. At each sampling, the citronellal diffusing from the hair was adsorbed onto a Tenax cartridge during 15 min, respectively. The cartridges were then thermally desorbed and the concentration of citronellal precisely quantified by GC (Table 11).<br>

Table 11 illustrates that the concentration of unprotected citronellal decreases rapidly with time whereas the citronellal released from the precursor remains almost constant during the experiment with constant light intensity. After only one hour of irradiation the concentration of citronellal released from the precursor is as high as the 25 concentration of the unprotected aldehyde, and thereafter remains higher than the concentration of the unprotected aldehyde.<br><br>

Dynamic headspace analysis for the slow release on cotton fabric<br>

The release of citronellal from precursor 13 was compared to the diffusion of unprotected aldehyde on cotton fabric. For the study, precisely determined amounts of ethanolic solutions containing either 0.2 mass-% of 13 or 0.1 mass-% (≈ 1 molar equivalent)  of unprotected  citronellal,  respectively,  were  sprayed  four  times  on<br>
10 4 x 20 cm cotton sheets, which had been washed beforehand with an unperfumed detergent base. The irradiation was carried out in a Pyrex ® glass tube for 3 h with a Xenon lamp as described above.<br>
Again a rapid decrease of the released amount unprotected citronellal over time was 15 observed, whereas the release of citronellal from the precursor remained constant with respect to the irradiation intensity, as illustrated in Table 12. The light dependence of the controlled perfume release was verified in a blank experiment. After only 3 h of irradiation comparable concentrations of citronellal were obtained either from the experiment with the free perfume or from release of the precursor compound. 20<br>

Example 15 Slow release from cotton sheets treated with fabric softener<br>
5 In a typical experiment, ten cotton towels were washed with an unperfumed, lipase free detergent powder and a fabric softener containing either 0.8 mass-% of keto ester 13 or 0.23 equivalents of the theoretically releasable unprotected aldehyde, respectively. The towels were washed at 40°C without prewashing cycle and dried in the dark overnight. Two towels of each type were irradiated with the above described UV lamp in one<br>
10 covered Pyrex ® crystallizing dish with an approximative volume of 3.5 1 and compared to a set of non irradiated samples. After 3 h of irradiation the towels were analyzed by nine panelists. In all cases the irradiated towels with precursor 13 were characterized to give a fresh, floral, citrus type odor, and the average intensity was given the value 3 on an increasing scale starting at 0 and ending at 10. In the case of the unprotected<br>
15 citronellal or the two blank samples, the panelists detected only a weak odor with an intensity of 1 on the scale from 0 to 10.<br>
The photoperfume precursor can therefore sucessfully be deposed on fabrics in a normal washing cycle, and the release of the desired perfume is detected in perceptible amounts 20     upon irradiation of the dry fabric.<br>
Example 16<br>
