LUBRICATING OIL COMPOSITION USEFUL IN HYDRAULIC FLUIDS<br>
The present invention relates to a lubricating oil composition having a low ash content or an ashless lubricating oil composition, and more specifically an antiwear type lubricating oil composition in which the ash content is reduced as low as possible, is excellent in thermal oxidation stability under severe conditions of a high temperature, is excellent in lubricating properties on various hydraulic apparatuses, and does not generate sludge even when a water content or a lubricating oil containing an overbasic alkaline earth metals additive, such as an engine oil, is incorporated.<br>
With a hydraulic apparatus being down-sized and used at a high speed and a high pressure, an oil is being used at a high temperature of 100°C  or higher instead of the conventional temperature range of from 50 to 70°C . Therefore, the conventional oils are not sufficient in thermal oxidation stability, and involve problems in that sludge is formed due to deterioration of the oil at a high pressure and a high temperature, the lubricating performance on a hydraulic pump is deteriorated, and friction between a seal and a rod of a hydraulic cylinder becomes large to generate rapid deterioration of the seal and abnormal vibration.<br>
On the other hand, a conventional lubricating oil containing zinc dialkyldithiophosphate as an antiwear agent exhibits good antiwear performance on a vane pump using a sliding material mainly composed of steel. However, the zinc dialkyldithiophosphate tends to accelerate wear of a copper alloy on a piston pump using<br><br>
a sliding material composed of various copper alloys and steel.  ThuS/ Denison Standard in U.S. recommends lowering the operation conditions when a zinc dialkyldithiophosphate type antiwear hydraulic oil is used in a piston pump.<br>
With a hydraulic apparatus being advanced and precise, a filter having an extremely small pore diameter of from 3 to 10 micrometer is being used in the apparatus.  Therefore, a hydraulic oil is required to have excellent filtering properties.  However, the conventional oil tends to clog the filter in an early stage because sludge is formed by inclusion of a water content or an alkaline earth metal salt-containing lubricating oil, such as an engine oil, which reacts with an additive contained in the hydraulic oil. Therefore, development of a lubricating oil composition capable of solving all the problems is demanded.<br>
A non-zinc type antiwear oil composition for hydraulic operation containing no zinc<br>
dialkyldithiophosphate has been known, and particularly an antiwear composition combining tricresyl phosphate or a triaryl phosphorothionate described in British Patent No 1,415,964 with an acidic phosphoric ester amine salt or triaryl phosphate has been known.<br>
However, such conventional non-zinc type antiwear oil compositions for hydraulic operation involve problems in that friction between a seal and a rod of a hydraulic cylinder is large, the wear resistance becomes insufficient due to a rust preventing agent used in combination, and the filtering properties are extremely deteriorated by inclusion of a slight amount of an alkaline earth metal salt.<br><br>
In addition to the above-described problems, there are increasing problems of using zinc compound including the zinc dialkyldithiophosphate from the standpoint of recent environmental protection and toxicity.<br>
An object of the invention is to provide a lubricating oil composition in which the content of ashes such as zinc is reduced to as low as possible, that is excellent in thermal oxidation stability, lubricating property, water proofing property and filtering property.<br>
As a result of investigation by the inventors to solve the problems associated with the conventional oils, it has been found that the problems are entirely solved by combining a specific antiwear agent and a specific rust preventing agent.<br>
The invention relates to a lubricating oil composition comprising<br>
(I)	100 parts by weight of a base oil for a<br>
lubricating oil;<br>
(II)	as an antiwear agent,<br>
(i) (a) from 0.05 to 10 parts by weight of a phosphorothionate represented by formula (1) , and (b) from 0.01 to 1.0 part by weight of an amine salt of a phosphorus compound which phosphorus compound is represented by formula (2a), and/or<br>
(ii) from 0.05 to 10 parts by weight of a dithiophosphate represented by formula (3a);<br>
(III)	as a rust preventing agent,<br>
from 0.01 to 1.0 part by weight of a polyalkylene polyamide obtained by reacting (a) a polyalkylene polyamine represented by formula (4a), and (b) a carboxylic acid having from 4 to 30 carbon atoms.<br><br>
S=P(-O-R1)3	(1)<br>

(in the formula, X represents a sulfur atom and/or an oxygen atom and R2 represents an alkyl and/or aryl group having from 2 to 30 carbon atoms),<br>
S=P(-O-R6)2(-S-A')	(3a)<br>
(in the formula, R6 represents an alkyl and/or aryl group having 1 to 30 carbon atoms and A' represents a hydrocarbon group optionally further containing one or more oxygen atoms),<br>

(in the formula, R10 represents an alkylene group having from 1 to 10 carbon atoms, R11, R12 and R13 each independently represent a hydrogen atom, an alkyl group having from 1 to 30 carbon atoms and/or a hydroxyalkyl group having from 1 to 30 carbon atoms and m is an integer from 1 to 10) .<br>
Further, the present invention relates to the use of lubricating compositions according to the present invention in hydraulic operation, in gears, in turbines and/or in bearings.<br>
The technical constitution of the invention is described in detail below. The base oil component constituting the lubricating oil composition of the invention is not particularly limited, if it contains petroleum base oils and/or synthetic hydrocarbon base oils.  It preferably exhibits a kinematic viscosity of from 2 to 680 mm /s (40°C ), preferably from 5 to 320 ram /s (40°C ), and particularly preferably from 8 to 220<br><br><br>

from 0 to 1%, preferably from 0 to 0.3%, a total nitrogen content (% by weight) of from 0 to 100 ppm, preferably from 0 to 30 ppm, and an aniline point of from 80 to 130°C, preferably from 100 to 125°C .<br>
The petroleum base oil for a lubricating oil is a sole substance or a mixture of a solvent refined base oil, a hydrogenation refined base oil and a high hydrogenation decomposed base oil.  The high hydrogenation decomposed base oil is a base oil for a lubricating oil having a viscosity index of 130 or more (typically from 145 to 155) obtained by such a manner that slack wax separated by solvent dewaxing as a raw material is isomerized from a linear paraffin to a branched paraffin by hydrogenolysis (catalytic cracking) in the presence of a catalyst, or a base oil for a lubricating oil having a viscosity index of 130 or more (typically from 145 to 155) obtained by such a manner that hydrogen and carbon monoxide as raw materials obtained by a gasification process (partial oxidation) of natural gas (e.g., methane) is subjected to the Fischer-Tropsch polymerization to form a heavy linear paraffin, which is then subjected to isomerization by catalytic cracking in the same manner as above.<br>
The synthetic hydrocarbon base oil may be an olefin oligomer obtained by sole polymerization or copolymerization of a monomer selected from a linear or branched olefin hydrocarbon having from 3 to 15 carbon atoms, preferably from 4 to 12 carbon atoms.<br>

When the addition amount is less than 0.05 part by weight, it is not preferred since sufficient lubricating performance cannot be obtained. When it exceeds 10 parts by weight, it is not preferred since although the lubricating performance is saturated, corrosion resistance, thermal oxidation stability and hydrolytic stability are lowered.<br>

Among these aliphatic amines, an alkylamine having from 6 to 24 carbon atoms and an alkylamine having from 6 to 24 carbon atoms added with from 1 to 2 mole of ethylene oxide are preferably used as the amine compound from the standpoint in that a lubricating oil composition excellent in wear resistance and corrosion prevention performance. When the acidic phosphoric ester and/or the acidic thiophosphoric ester contains a branched alkyl group, an alkylamine for neutralization may contain either a linear alkyl group or a branched alkyl group.  When the acidic phosphoric ester and/or the acidic thiophosphoric ester contains a linear alkyl group, an alkylamine for neutralization preferably contains a branched alkyl group from the standpoint of solubility in the base oil.<br>
The addition amount of the amine salt of the acidic phosphoric ester and/or the acidic thiophosphoric ester, i.e., the neutralized product of an amine, is from 0.01 to 1 part by weight, preferably from 0.01 to 0.2 part by weight, per 100 parts by weight of the base oil for a lubricating oil.  When the addition amount is less than 0.01 part by weight, sufficient lubricating property cannot be obtained.  When it exceeds 1 part by weight, the lubricating performance is saturated, but corrosion<br><br>
resistance, thermal oxidation stability and hydrolytic<br>
stability are lowered.  Particularly, in the case  where<br>
2<br>
R is a linear alkyl group, when the addition amount<br>
exceeds 0.1 part by weight, the filtering property is extremely deteriorated on inclusion of a lubricating oil containing an alkaline earth metal salt.<br>

The addition amount of the trialkyl dithiophosphate used in the invention is from 0.05 to 10 parts by weight, preferably from 0.1 to 1 part by weight, per 100 parts by weight of the base oil for a lubricating oil. When the addition amount is less than this range, sufficient lubricating performance cannot be obtained. When the addition amount exceeds this range, the lubricating performance is saturated, but corrosion resistance, thermal oxidation stability and hydrolytic stability are lowered.<br>

R11 (R12) -N- (R10-NR13)«H	(4a)<br>
(in the formula, R10 represents an alkylene group having from 1 to 10 carbon atoms, R11, R12 and R13 each independently represents a hydrogen atom, an alkyl group having from 1 to 30 carbon atoms, preferably from 1 to 10, and/or a hydroxy alkyl group having from 1 to 30<br><br>
carbon  atoms,   preferably  from 1  to  10,   and m is  an integer  from 1 to  10) .<br>
Preferably,   R10 represents  an  alkylene  group having from 2   to   6  carbon atoms,   and R11,   R12 and  R13 each independently represents  a  hydrogen  atom and/or an  alkyl group having  from 1  to  10  carbon  atoms.<br>

The carboxylic acid to be reacted with the polyalkylene polyamine can be any suitable carboxylic acid containing at least one carboxylic acid group and containing in total from 4 to 30 carbon atoms, preferably from 12 to 30 carbon atoms.  Examples of suitable acids containing more than one carboxylic acid group, are succinic acid and adipic acid.  Preferably, the carboxylic acid is a monocarboxylic acid.  Most preferably, the acid is a monocarboxylic acid selected from a saturated monocarboyxlic acid having from 12 to 30 carbon atoms and an unsaturated monocarboyxlic acid having from 18 to 24 carbon atoms.<br>
The use of carboxylic acid includes single use of an unsaturated fatty acid, single use of a branched saturated fatty acid, combination use of an unsaturated fatty acid and a branched saturated fatty acid, and combination use of a branched saturated fatty acid and a<br><br>
linear saturated fatty acid.  Specific examples of the unsaturated fatty acid include a monocarboxylic acid having from 18 to 24 carbon atoms, such as oleic acid, elaidic acid, cetoleic acid, erucic acid and brassidic acid.  Specific examples of the branched saturated fatty acid include a monocarboxylic acid having from 18 to 30 carbon atoms, such as 2-methylheptadecanoic acid, 16-methylheptadecanoic acid, 2-octadecanoic acid, 2-methyloctadecanoic acid, 10-methyloctadecanoic acid, 15-ethylheptadecanoic acid, 3-methylnonadecanoic acid, 2-butyl-2-heptylnonanoic acid, 2-ethyleicosanoic acid, 20-methylheneicosanoic acid, 3-methyltricosanoic acid, 10-methyltetracosanoic acid, 18-methyltetracosanoic acid, 13,16-dimethyltricosanoic acid, 3,13,19-trimethyltricosanoic acid and isostearic acid.

As the aliphatic monocarboxylic acid component, an aliphatic monocarboxylic acid in which the aliphatic group thereof is a linear saturated or unsaturated alkyl group is basically a main part.  However, if only this aliphatic monocarboxylic acid is used, there may be a case that it fails in solubility against the base oil. Therefore, it is preferred that an aliphatic monocarboxylic acid having a branched alkyl group is partly used together, thereby adjusting the solubility. Specific examples of combinations which can be suitably employed include (1) a combination of an aliphatic monocarboxylic acid having a linear saturated alkyl group with an aliphatic monocarboxylic acid having a branched<br><br>
saturated alkyl group and (2) a combination of an aliphatic monocarboxylic acid having a linear unsaturated alkyl group with an aliphatic monocarboxylic acid having a branched saturated alkyl group.  In these combinations, though the ratio of the linear aliphatic monocarboxylic acid to the branched monocarboxylic acid varies depending on the properties of the base oil used, it is usually from 25:75 to 100:0 by mole.<br>
The reaction of the polyalkylene polyamine and the carboxylic acid is conducted at a temperature of from 200 to 220°C for from 2 to 3 hours, to obtain the desired amide.  An amount of the monocarboxylic acid used is preferably less than (m+1) mole per mole of the polyalkylene polyamine.<br>
Published Japanese Patent Application No. 5-46878 discloses a composition obtained by reacting a polyalkylene polyamine with a fatty acid composed of from 20 to 100 mol% of an unsaturated monocarboxylic acid and from 80 to 0 mol% of a branched saturated monocarboxylic acid, and discloses that the storage stability and the sludge dispersion capability of the lubricating oil can be improved by the composition, so that the generation of an insoluble sticky substance can be suppressed. In general, while this kind of amide has a function of dispersing sludge insoluble in an oil formed due to deterioration of the oil as described in Examined Published Japanese Patent Application No. 39-3115 and No. 5-46878, it also has a function of dispersing water content included in the lubricating oil, and thus it tends to extremely lower the emulsification resistant property of the lubricating oil.  In the invention, however, it has been found that the lowering of the emulsification resistant property<br><br>
can be greatly improved by the combination use of the amine salt of an acidic phosphoric ester or the amine salt of an acidic thiophosphoric ester, as a component of antiwear agent.<br>
It has also be found that the polyamide used in the invention has high rust preventing property and a function in that friction between a rod and a seal of a hydraulic cylinder is reduced to make the operation of the cylinder smooth.  In the conventional rust preventing agent of a partial ester of succinic acid, which has been used in lubricating oils for industrial machines, when a lubricating oil containing an alkaline earth metal salt such as an engine oil is included, problems may occur in that sludge is formed to clog a filter, and to adversely affect the wear preventing property of an antiwear agent and the load resisting performance of an extreme-pressure agent.  However, the polyamide type rust preventing agent of the invention does not bring about such generation of sludge on inclusion of an alkaline earth metal salt, and it has been found that the combination use with the antiwear agent of the invention does not adversely affect the antiwear property and the load carrying performance.<br>
The addition amount of the polyamide obtained by reacting the polyalkylene polyamine and the monocarboxylic acid is from 0.01 to 1 part by weight, preferably from 0.02 to 0.5 part by weight, per 100 parts by weight of the base oil for a lubricating oil. When the addition amount is less than 0,01 part by weight, the rust preventing property and the function of reducing the friction between the rod and the seal of the hydraulic cylinder are not sufficient.  When it exceed 1 part by weight, it is not preferred since the<br><br>
lubricating performance  is  saturated,   but  emulsification resistant property is  lowered.<br>
In  order  to  further  improve  the performance  of  the lubricating oil  composition of  the  invention,   various auxiliary additives  generally used may be used depending on necessity,   in  addition to the necessary components. For  example,   known  additives  for  lubricating oils,   such as  an antioxidant,   a metal deactivator,   an extreme-pressure  agent,   an oiliness  agent,   a defoaming agent,   a viscosity index improving agent,   a pour point depressing agent,   a  detergent dispersant,   a  rust preventing agent and an  anti-emulsification agent.<br>

The results obtain are also shown in Table 7.  In the Examples and Comparative Examples, various performance evaluation tests were carried out in the following manner.<br>
Filtering Property Test<br>
The occurrence of clogging of a filter on inclusion of water or an overbasic metallic salt was evaluated. 0.15 g of calcium salicylate (calcium content: 6.0% by weight, total base number: 160 mgKOH/g) as an overbasic metallic salt and 0.3 g of water were mixed with 300 g<br><br>
of the sample oil at room temperature, and after sealing, it was allowed to stand in an incubator at 70°C for 96 hours and then at room temperature for 24 hours. 300 ml of the sample oil containing water and the overbasic basic metallic salt was filtered through a membrane filter having a pore diameter of 1.2 micrometer (47 mm in diameter) at a differential pressure of 660 mmHg, and a filtering time (second) required for filtering was measured.  A time (second) required for filtering 300 ml of the sample oil containing no water or overbasic metallic salt was also measured, and the ratio of the filtering time of the sample oil containing water and the overbasic metallic salt to the filtering time of the sample oil containing no water or overbasic metallic salt was obtained.  When the ratio exceeds twice, there is a tendency that a filter is clogged in an early stage in a practical hydraulic apparatus. Rust Prevention Test<br>
In order to evaluate the rust preventing performance of the sample oils, a rust prevention test was conducted in an artificial sea water at 60°C for 24 hours according to ASTM D665, and a steel test piece was examined whether or not rust was formed.  In German Standard DIN51524 (part 2), it is required that no rust is formed on this test. Anti-emulsification Test<br>
The water-separation property of the sample oils was evaluated according to ASTM D1401.  4 0 ml of the sample oil and 40 ml of pure water were placed in a test tube and stirred at 54°C for 5 minutes.  Then, a time (minute) required for completely separating water and the oil was measured.  In LH03-1-94 of GM (General<br><br>
Motors) Standard, it is required that the time for separating the oil from water is 30 minutes or less. Thermal Stability Test<br>
The thermal stability of the sample oils was evaluated according to the standard for purchasing lubricating oils by Cincinnati Milacron / Inc. (U.S.) (lO-SP-80160-3) .  An iron rod and a copper rod as catalysts were immersed in 200 ml of the sample oil, which was allowed to stand in an oven at 135°C for 168 hours, and the sample oil was filtered through a membrane filter having a pore diameter of 8 micrometer, to measure the weight of sludge formed.  According to the P-68, P-69 and P-70 Standards of an oil defined by Cincinnati Milacron , Inc., it is required that the amount of sludge is 25 mg or less per 100 ml. Oxidation Stability Test<br>
The oxidation stability of the sample oils was evaluated according to ASTM D4310.  A coil of iron and a coil of copper as catalysts were immersed in 300 ml of the sample oil.  60 ml of water was further added, and 3 liters per minute of oxygen was blown into the sample oil at 95°C, to conduct an oxidation test for 1,000 hours-  After completion of the test, the sample oil was filtered through a membrane filter having a pore diameter of 5 micrometer, to measure the weight of sludge formed.  Furthermore, in order to evaluate the corrosiveness of the sample oil on copper and iron, the contents (mg) of copper and iron in the oil phase, the water phase and the sludge after the test were measured by an emission spectral analysis.  According to the standard for an oil for hydraulic operation defined by Denison Corp., it is required that the amount of sludge formed is 200 mg or less in HF-0 and 100 mg or less in<br><br>
HF-1, and the amount of copper corroded and the amount of iron corroded are both 50 mg or less. Hydrolytic Stability Test<br>
The hydrolytic stability of the sample oils was evaluated according to ASTM D2619.  A copper plate as a catalyst was immersed in a bottle containing 75 ml of the sample oil and 25 ml of water, and after sealing, the bottle was rotated at 93°C for 48 hours.  After completion of the test, the weight loss of the copper plate and the acid value of the water phase were measured.  According to Standard HF-0 for an oil for hydraulic operation defined by Denison Corp. and Standard LH-03-1-94 of GM (General Motors), it is required that the weight loss of the copper plate is 0.2 mg/cm2 or less, and the acid value of the water phase is 4 mgKOH or less. FZG Gear Test<br>
The lubricating performance of the sample oils for a gear apparatus was evaluated according to ISO/WD14 635-1.  Operation was conducted by using Gear A at an initial oil temperature of 90°C and a rotation number of motor of 1,450 rpm for 15 minutes for each step of load, and with increasing the step of load, the step of load, at which seizing was formed on the tooth surface of the test gear, was measured. According to the German Standard DIN51524 (part 2), it is required for an antiwear oil for hydraulic operation that the step of load, at which seizing is formed, is the tenth step or higher. Orethane Seal Friction Test<br>
The friction property of the sample oils between a rod and an urethane seal of a hydraulic cylinder was evaluated by using a slip-stick testing apparatus of<br><br>
Cincinnati Milacron, Inc. (former ASTM D2877).  The sample oil was coated between a steel test piece and an urethane test piece (U801 produced by NOK), and the kinetic friction coefficient was measured at a sliding speed of 1.27 mm/min- and a load of 22.4 kgf.  In a lubricating oil exhibiting a kinetic friction coefficient exceeding 0.6, friction between a seal and a rod of a practical hydraulic cylinder becomes large, and problems upon use, such as rapid deterioration of the seal and abnormal vibration, occur. Vane Pump Test<br>
The wear preventing performance of the sample oils for a vane pump was evaluated by using Vickers 35VQ-25A pump.  The pump test was conducted at an oil temperature of 65°C, a rotation number of 2,400 rpm and a pressure of 210 kgf/cm2 for 50 hours, the wear amounts of the vane and the ring after the test were measured. According to M-2950-S Standard defined by Vickers Corp., it is required that the wear amount is 90 mg or less. [Piston Pump Test]<br>
While a vane and a ring as main sliding members in a vane pump are composed of steel, main sliding members in a piston pump are usually composed of steel and a copper alloy.  Therefore, in a vane pump, the antiwear property of a lubricating oil is required for sliding between steel pairs, whereas in a piston pump, the antiwear property of a lubricating oil is required for sliding between steel and copper alloy materials.  The antiwear performance of the sample oils was evaluated by using a swash plate type tandem piston pump (HPV35+35) produced by Komatsu Corp.  An endurance test was conducted with applying a load to a pump of the rear side under the following conditions for 500 hours, and<br><br>
after completion of the test, the wear amounts (mg) of the pistons and the cylinder of the pump of the rear side were measured. Test Conditions: Pressure cycle:<br>
2 seconds with no load, and 3 seconds at 320 kgf/cm2 Flow amount:<br>
65 L/min. with no load, and 43 L/min. at 320 kgf/cm2<br>
Rotation number:  2,100 rpm Temperature:  95°C<br>
When the wear amount exceeds 1,500 mg in this test, the flow amount of the pump is lowered, and the pressure fluctuation and the noise become large.  As a result, there is a danger of occurring problems in lubrication of a piston pump.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
Comparative Examples 1 and 2 could not exhibit sufficient performance in the FZG gear test and the vane pump test, and failed German standard DIN51524 (part 2) and Vickers Standard M-2950-S.  In Comparative Example 1, a large amount of wear occurred in the piston pump test and had a problem in applicability to a piston pump.  Comparative Example 2 involved a problem in the emulsification resisting property and failed GM Standard LH-03-1-94.<br>

In Comparative Example 3, a large amount of rust was formed in the oxidation stability test, and failed Denisbn Standards HF-0 and HF-1 for an oil for hydraulic operation and DIN51524 (part 2).<br>
Comparative Example 4 could not exhibit sufficient performance in the rust prevention test, the oxidation stability test, the hydrolytic stability test and the urethane seal friction test, and failed Denison Standards HF-0 and HF-1 for an oil for hydraulic operation and DIN51524 (part 2).<br><br><br><br><br><br>

Also, a large amount of wear was formed in the piston pump test.<br>
Comparative Example 6 could not exhibit sufficient performance in the filtering property test and the urethane seal friction test, and failed P-68 Standard for a hydraulic oil by Cincinnati Milacron, Inc.<br>
Comparative Example 7 could not exhibit sufficient performance in the FZG gear test and the vane pump test, and failed German Standard DIN51524 (part 2) and M-2950-S Standard by Vickers.<br>
Comparative Example 8 could not exhibit sufficient performance in the oxidation stability test, the hydrolytic stability test and the FZG gear test, and failed HF-0 Standard and HF-1 Standard by Denison, German Standard DIN51524 (part 2) and M-29i50-S Standard by Vickers.<br>
Comparative Example 9 failed HF-0 Standard and HF-1 Standard by Denison and M-2950-S Standard by Vickers in the oxidation stability test and the hydrolytic stability test.<br>
Comparative Example 10 involved problems in the filtering property test, the FZG gear test, the urethane seal friction test and the vane pump test and failed German Standard DIN51524 (part 2) and MS-2950-S Standard by Vickers.<br>
It is clear from the compositions shown in Table 1 and the results shown in Table 4 that the lubricating oil composition of the invention is excellent in rust<br><br>
prevention property, corrosion resisting property for copper and iron, filtering property, thermal oxidation stability, antiwear property for vane and piston pumps, wear property for hydraulic cylinder, and load capacity to gear elements, and thus exhibits performance that satisfies all the required performance as an oil for hydraulic operation.  On the other hand, in the case where the necessary component in the invention is lacking (Comparative Examples), and in the case of the commercially available zinc type oil and non-zinc type oil, at least one of required performance as an antiwear hydraulic oil is greatly deteriorated, and therefore gives problems for use as a lubricating oil for recent hydraulic apparatus that is down-sized, operated at a high speed and a high pressure, and is precise. Effect of the Invention<br>
The lubricating oil composition of the invention does not contain zinc dialkyldithiophosphate from the standpoint of environment and safety, and is excellent in lubricating property, water proofing property, filtering property and rust preventing property, including use in recent hydraulic apparatus that is down-sized, operated at a high speed and a high pressure, and is precise.  Therefore, the composition of the invention satisfies all the various required performances for a hydraulic oil defined by the standards of Cincinnati Milacron, Inc., Denison, Vickers, GM and DIN, and also exhibits excellent performance in filtering property and urethane seal friction property.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
