DATA TRANSMISSION SYSTEM IN BROADBAND WIRELESS ACCESS<br>
SYSTEM USING BAND AMC AND METHOD THEREOF<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates generally to a data transmission system in a<br>
wireless communication system and a method thereof, and more particularly to a<br>
system for transmitting data by applying a band AMC (Adaptive Modulation and<br>
Coding) in an OFDMA (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing Access)<br>
system and a method thereof.<br>
2.	Description of the Related Art<br>
Typically, a wireless communication system is a system developed to be<br>
used in cases in which a fixed wire network cannot be connected to a terminal.<br>
The wireless communication system has been developed into a mobile<br>
communication system such as a cellular system. The cellular system connects a<br>
base station, which communicates with a terminal through a wireless channel, to a<br>
wire network. A representative cellular system is a cellular mobile communication<br>
system that uses a CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access) system.<br>
Although the cellular system was developed to provide voice<br>
communications, systems that can provide diverse data services have now been<br>
proposed. Additionally, since the amount of data required by respective users is<br>
increasing, users now desire to transmit a larger amount of data at a higher speed.<br>
Accordingly, research has been made to support high speed data transfer in the<br>
cellular system that uses the CDMA system.<br>
Meanwhile, in order to provide a large amount of data to users at a high<br>
speed, research into an OFDM (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing)<br>
system that is different from the CDMA system has actively been in progress, in<br>
order to commercialize a system that uses the OFDM system. Accordingly, the<br>
IEEE 802.16 standardization group of IEEE (Institute of Electrical and<br>
Electronics Engineers) is carrying out the establishment of the IEEE 802.16d<br>
standard for proving a broadband wireless Internet service with respect to a fixed<br>
terminal.<br>
The OFDM system may be defined as a second-dimensional access<br><br>
method that combines the techniques of TDA (Time Division Access) and FDA<br>
(Frequency Division Access). In IEEE P802.16d/D3-2004, an OFDMA<br>
(Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access) method is used in which the<br>
entire band is divided into subcarriers, some of these subcarriers are grouped into<br>
subchannels, and the respective subchannels are allocated to all users.<br>
Accordingly, all user terminals in the system use the subchannels composed of<br>
subcarriers broadly spread over the entire band, and in the system that uses the<br>
OFDMA system (hereinafter referred to as the 'OFDMA system'), each of user<br>
data is transmitted to corresponding user through a plurality d of subcarriers that<br>
constitute a specified subchannel.<br>
Meanwhile, in the broadband OFDMA system, all users connected to a<br>
base station share and use common channels, and sections used by the respective<br>
users are allocated for each frame by the base station. Accordingly, the base<br>
station divides access information into uplink access information and downlink<br>
access information, and allocates the uplink access information and the downlink<br>
information to the front part of each frame to be broadcast to all users.<br>
In the broadband OFDMA system, the access information that is<br>
transmitted for each frame includes information such as a modulation method, a<br>
coding rate, etc. A general frame structure will now be explained with reference to<br>
the accompanying drawings.<br>
FIG. 1 is a view illustrating a frame structure including uplinks and<br>
downlinks in a general broadband OFDMA system. In FIG. 1, the vertical axis<br>
represents the numbers (S, S+1, S+2, ..., S+L) 147 of various subchannels, and<br>
the horizontal axis, i.e., the time axis (t), represents the numbers 145 of OFDMA<br>
symbols.<br>
Referring to FIG. 1, a frame is composed of a downlink (DL) 149 and an<br>
uplink (UL) 153 divided in time, and an OFDMA frame is composed of a<br>
plurality (for example, L) subchannels. This OFDMA system is a system having<br>
an object of obtaining a frequency diversity gain by dispersing the whole<br>
subcarriers used in the system and especially data subcarriers over the entire<br>
frequency band.<br>
The downlink 149 includes a preamble 111, located in front, for<br>
synchronizing a transmitter-side terminal with a receiver-side base station,<br>
broadcast data information such as FCH (Frame Control Header) 113, DL_MAP<br>
115 and UL_MAP 117, and downlink bursts 121, 123, 125, 127 and 129.<br><br>
The uplink 153 includes preambles 131, 133 and 135, located in front of<br>
uplink bursts 137, 139 and 141, for synchronizing the transmitter-side terminal<br>
and the receiver-side base station, and a ranging subchannel 143 for adjusting a<br>
receiving power of the base station. The base station informs the terminal of<br>
information about positions and allocations of the uplink bursts 137, 139 and 141<br>
and the downlink bursts 121, 123, 125, 127 and 129 through DLMAP 115 and<br>
UL_MAP 117. The terminal is variably allocated with the subchannels in which<br>
the frequency and the symbol are combined for each frame through this<br>
information, and communicates with the base station. That is, the terminal<br>
receives and uses different subchannels, not fixed subchannels, for each frame.<br>
Additionally, a conversion process from the downlink to the uplink is<br>
performed for a first TTG (Transmit/receive Transition Gap) 151, and a<br>
conversion process from the uplink to the downlink is performed for a second<br>
RTG (Receive/transmit Transition Gap) 155. After these conversions are<br>
processed, a preamble region is placed so that the terminal can obtain the system<br>
sync.<br>
As described above, the frame is coded, modulated and then transmitted<br>
in accordance with the most accurate coding rate and transmission rate before it is<br>
transmitted through a wireless channel. For example, the channel state of the<br>
terminal is changed according to the cell position of the terminal. A terminal<br>
located in the center of the cell has a good channel state, and a high-efficiency<br>
modulation and a low coding rate are used, while a terminal located on the cell<br>
boundary has a poor channel state due to interference with adjacent base stations,<br>
and a low-efficiency modulation and a high coding rate are used, so that the<br>
reliability of data can be heightened.<br>
However, since the conventional OFDMA system uses subchannels<br>
composed of subcarriers broadly spread over the whole band, it is impossible for<br>
a specified terminal to use a frequency band determined to have a good quality<br>
according to its channel state or to change the coding or modulation method<br>
according to the channel quality.<br>
Additionally, the frame structure as described above makes it difficult to<br>
use a multiplexed coding method by which the coding and modulation being used<br>
is changed by frequency bands. This is because if the multiplexed coding method<br>
by frequency bands is used in the conventional system, which groups the<br>
subcarriers and uses the subcarrier groups as the subchannels, subfrequency bands<br><br>
obtained by dividing a frequency band are used as the subchannels.<br>
Accordingly, the subchannels of the multiplexed coding method by<br>
frequency bands cannot be expressed by the above-described general frame<br>
structure and the MAP information elements, included therein, for informing the<br>
terminal of information about the coding and modulation.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>

and other problems occurring in the prior art, and an object of the present<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Preferred embodiments of the present invention will be described in detail<br>
hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings. In the following<br>
description of the present invention, the same drawing reference numerals are<br>
used for the same elements even if in different drawings. Additionally, a<br>
detailed description of known functions and configurations incorporated herein<br>
will be omitted when it may obscure the subject matter of the present invention.<br>
According to the present invention, in the case in which a base station<br>
(BS) and a subscriber station (SS) communicate with each other using a band<br>
AMC, the base station informs the subscriber station of the allocated frequency<br>
band and the coding method to be used. For this, new MAP information elements<br>
for the band AMC are defined. At the same time, a scheme for minimizing<br>
overhead generated during the transfer of the newly generated MAP information<br>
element should also be taken into consideration. Accordingly, in the embodiments<br>
of the present invention, a form of MAP information elements having low<br>
overhead that is required in using the band AMC in the broadband wireless access<br>
system is newly defined, and a method for generating and interpreting such MAP<br>
information elements will be explained.<br>
First, the frame structure that includes newly generated MAP information<br>
elements according to an embodiment of the present invention will be explained.<br>
FIG. 2 is a view illustrating the frame structure of uplinks and downlinks<br>
in a broadband OFDMA system that uses a band AMC according to an<br>
embodiment of the present invention. In FIG. 2, the number of downlink band<br>
AMC subchannels is k+1 and the number of uplink band AMC subchannels is h.<br>
The respective band AMC subchannels are indicated as Band AMC DL Burst<br>
#k+l and Band AMC UL Burst #h. The horizontal axis represents OFDMA<br>
symbols, and the vertical axis represents subchannels.<br><br>
Referring to FIG. 2, in a frame, one frequency band is divided into m+1<br>
sub frequency bands Band 0, Band 1, Band 2, ... , Band m on the vertical axis,<br>
and respective OFDM symbols are divided in the form of bins on the vertical axis,<br>
i.e., the time (t) axis. Here, the term 'bin' means an allocation unit used in a band<br>
AMC channel formed by grouping a specified number of subcarriers.<br>
Specifically, a frame is composed of a downlink (DL) and an uplink (UL).<br>
Preambles 201 and 202 are included in front OFDMA symbol regions of the<br>
respective links, and a system information channel (hereinafter referred to as an<br>
'SICH') 203 is included in the next OFDMA symbol region. The following<br>
broadcasting control region is divided into a downlink (DL) diversity region 210<br>
that includes uplink or downlink MAP information elements and a downlink (DL)<br>
band AMC region 220 that includes band AMC DL bursts.<br>
The downlink diversity region 210 includes MAP information elements<br>
MAPIE for designating positions of the respective DL/UL bursts transmitted<br>
through the diversity subchannels and multiple AMC subchannels, and the<br>
corresponding terminals. Unlike the conventional system, in the frame structure,<br>
the downlink MAP information elements and the uplink MAP information<br>
elements are not separately arranged, but are mixed together. In the frame<br>
structure of FIG. 2, the uplink and downlink MAP information elements have the<br>
same type in a data format. In order to discriminate the uplink and downlink<br>
information elements from each other, the respective information element has a<br>
UL/DL indication field, and according to this value, it can be discriminated<br>
whether the corresponding MAP element is for the uplink or the downlink.<br>
Additionally, in the frame structure of FIG. 2, the MAP information elements for<br>
the diversity subchannels and the MAP information elements for the AMC<br>
channels may mixed together, and in order to discriminate the MAP information<br>
elements from each other, a type field is included in the respective information<br>
element. A detailed explanation thereof will be made below.<br>
The base station variably allocates bins located in the sub frequency band<br>
that shows the best channel state among the sub frequency bands to the<br>
corresponding terminal, and broadcasts the allocated position through a<br>
broadcasting control region for the transmission of the MAP information elements<br>
of the frame using the MAP information type proposed according to the present<br>
invention. Here, the number of bins allocated is indicated in a value of Nsch.For<br>
example, in the case of using 6 bins as one band AMC subchannel, 6, 12 and 24<br><br>
bins are allocated if the set value is 1, 2 and 4, respectively.<br>
For example, as illustrated in FIG. 2, the first band AMC DL burst (Band<br>
AMC DL Burst # l)is transmitted through a band AMC subchannels composed of<br>
12 bins and 6 bins, the third band AMC DL burst (Band AMC DL Burst #3)is<br>
transmitted through a band AMC subchannels composed of 12 bins, and the<br>
second band AMC DL burst (Band AMC DL Burst #2)is transmitted through two<br>
band AMC subchannels composed of 6 bins. The fifth AMC DL burst (Band<br>
AMC DL Burst #5)is transmitted through one Band AMC subchannels composed<br>
of 6 bins, and the fourth band AMC DL burst (Band AMC DL Burst #4) would be<br>
transmitted through one of the subbands not illustrated in FIG. 2.<br>
The structure of the uplink and downlink MAP information elements<br>
DL MAP IE and UP_MAP IE for designating the allocated bins in the frame<br>
structure as described above will be explained in more detail.<br>
FIG. 3 is a view illustrating the structure of MAP information elements<br>
for a band AMC according to an embodiment of the present invention.<br>
As illustrated in FIG. 3, in the MAP information element format for use in<br>
the band AMC, a two-bit "Type=l" field indicates the type of the MAP<br>
information element. Here, although the type field is constructed so that it can<br>
support four types (of diversity, band AMC, circuit stream and safety) in all, the<br>
detailed explanation of the respective types is not related to the gist of the present<br>
invention, and thus will be omitted. The MAP information element is a MAP<br>
information element for the terminal that operates in the band AMC type, and is<br>
set to a value of '1'.<br>
A one-bit "DL/UL indication" field is a field that indicates an identifier<br>
for discriminating the downlink and the uplink from each other. This field has a<br>
value of '0' if the corresponding MAP information element corresponds to the<br>
band AMC subchannel allocation for the downlink, and has a value of ' 1' if the<br>
corresponding MAP information elements corresponds to the subchannel<br>
allocation for the uplink. Here, unlike the existing IEEE 802.16 system, different<br>
types of MAP information element are not used with respect to the uplink and<br>
downlink bursts, but a common type of MAP information element is used as<br>
needed.<br>
A 16-bit "MSS ID" field indicates the ID of the terminal (Mobile<br>
Subscriber Station) that will receive the corresponding MAP information element.<br>
The respective terminal is allocated with one MSS ID during its access to the base<br><br>
station, and thus the terminal that will receive the respective MAP information<br>
element is displayed using the MSS ID. The terminal designated as a receiver of<br>
the MAP information element through the MSS ID value finds the position of the<br>
subchannel through which it will transmit/receive data to/from the base station by<br>
interpreting the contents of the respective variables included in the received MAP<br>
information element, and transmits and receives the data through the<br>
corresponding subchannel at a determined time.<br>
A four-bit "Nep" field indicates the size of an encoder packet of the UL<br>
burst or DL burst that the terminal will transmit or receive by the corresponding<br>
MAP information element.<br>
A two-bit "No. Band" field indicates the number of frequency bands<br>
allocated for data bursts designated by the corresponding MAP information<br>
element. If the value of No. Band is '00', it indicates that one band is allocated for<br>
the data bursts. If the value of No. Band is '01', it indicates that two bands are<br>
allocated for the data bursts. If the value of No. Band is '10', it indicates that<br>
reserved values remain, to be determined for future use. If the value of No. Band<br>
is '11', it indicates that the number of bands to be used and the position<br>
information are displayed in the form of a bitmap of 12 bits that follow the term<br>
No. Band.<br>
A 12-bit "Band BITMAP" field is a field that is included if the field No.<br>
Band has the value of '11'. The respective bits of the Band BITMAP means 0th<br>
-12th bands of the Band BITMAP, respectively. The corresponding band has a<br>
value of '1' when it is used for the data bursts, while it has a value of '0' if it is<br>
not used. By contrast, if No. Band has the value of '00' or '01', a four-bit "Band<br>
Index" that follows No. Band appears repeatedly as many times as the number of<br>
bands that are indicated as No. Band.<br>
A following 5-bit "Nsch" field indicates the size of the sub channel in the<br>
band designated for the position of the data bursts that the terminal should receive<br>
by the respective band information included in the downlink MAP information<br>
element. That is, the "Nsch" field indicates the size of the subchannel of the<br>
respective band designated through the Band BITMAP or BAND Index having a<br>
size of four bits after No. Band.<br>
A one-bit "UL burst continue" field is set to ' 1' when the reduced uplink<br>
MAP information element for the same terminal appears just after the downlink<br>
access information element. Here, if the UL burst continue is set to '0', it<br><br>
indicates that no UL burst exists, while if it is set to T, it indicates that UL and<br>
DL are simultaneously used. In this case, it includes "ReducedMAP IE" having<br>
variable bits. This reduced uplink MAP information element is illustrated in FIG.<br>
4.<br>
Referring to FIG 4, the reduced uplink MAP information element is<br>
included in the downlink MAP information element having MSS ID, and in order<br>
to reduce the overhead, the field for indicating the DL/UL indication and the MSS<br>
ID field are omitted in comparison to the normal MAP information element.<br>
Additionally, the reduced MAP information element has a one-bit "Reduced<br>
Type" field instead of the Type field, and is set to '1'. Other values are set in the<br>
same manner as the method for constructing the MAP information that is not<br>
reduced.<br>
The process of generating the MAP information elements having the<br>
above-described structure will now be explained<br>
FIGs. 5A to 5B are flowcharts illustrating the operation of generating<br>
MAP information elements according to an embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Here, since the MAP information elements are information for the base station's<br>
informing the terminal of the frequency allocated to the terminal and the coding<br>
method to be used, the process illustrated in FIG. 5 will be explained from the<br>
position of the base station.<br>
Referring to FIG. 5, the base station determines whether the band AMC<br>
type is allocated at step 501. If the band AMC type is not allocated, the base<br>
station performs a specified process of allocating the MAP information elements<br>
for the diversity type at step 502. and then terminates the process. By contrast, if<br>
the band AMC type is allocated at step 501, the base station sets the message type<br>
to '1' at step 503.<br>
The base station sets the ID of the terminal that will receive the corresponding<br>
MAP information element in the MSS ID field and sets the size of the encoder<br>
packet of the uplink burst or the downlink burst that the terminal transmits and<br>
receives in the Nep field at step 504.<br>
Then, the base station confirms whether the allocation is made for the<br>
downlink DL or the uplink UL at step 505. If the allocation is the Band AMC<br>
subchannel allocation for the uplink UL as a result of confirmation, the base<br>
station sets the UL/DL indicator field to '1' at step 506, and then moves to step<br>
508. By contrast, if the allocation is the Band AMC subchannel allocation for the<br><br>
downlink DL, the base station sets the UL/DL indicator field to '0' at step 507.<br>
The base station inputs the number of bands allocated to No. Band field<br>
as a code at step 508. Then, the base station determines whether the number of<br>
bands being allocated exceeds 3 at step 509. At this time, if the number of bands<br>
being allocated is less than 3, the base station prepares the first band index at step<br>
510, and confirms whether No. Band is set to '01' at step 515. If the set value is<br>
not '01', the base station proceeds to step 514, while if the set value is '01', it<br>
prepares the second band index at step 512. By contrast, if the number of bands is<br>
more than 3 as a result of confirmation at step 509, the base station prepares the<br>
allocated band as Band BITMAP at step 513.<br>
The base station sets the number of bands to the N_band value<br>
determined by the value set in the No. Band at step 514, and initializes a<br>
temporary variable i as '0' at step 515. The base station determines whether i is<br>
smaller than N_band at step 516. At this time, since i is set to '0' at step 515, i is<br>
smaller than N_band. In this case, the base station prepares the number Nsch of<br>
band AMC subchannels to be used in the i-th used band at step 517, increases i by<br>
'1' at step 518, and then proceeds to step 516 to repeat the above-described<br>
processes.<br>
If i becomes larger than N-band after the above-described repeated<br>
processes, the base station proceeds to step 520 to determine whether the<br>
allocation is made for the uplink or the downlink at step 520. If the allocation is<br>
made for the uplink, the base station terminates its operation, while otherwise, it<br>
determines whether an uplink resource allocation having the same MSS ID is<br>
required at step 521. If the uplink resource allocation having the same MSS ID is<br>
not required at step 521, the base station sets the UL continue field to '0' at step<br>
522 since there is no uplink burst. By contrast, if the uplink resource allocation<br>
having the same MSS ID is required, the base station sets the UL continue field to<br>
' 1' at step 523 since there are continuous uplink bursts, and prepares the reduced<br>
MAP information elements for the uplink resource allocation at step 524 to<br>
terminate the following operation.<br>
If the UL resource allocation having the same MSS ID is required as at<br>
step 521 during the generation of the MAP information element through the<br>
above-described operation, the base station prepares the reduced MAP<br>
information element. The process of generating the reduced MAP information<br>
elements will be explained in more detail with reference to the accompanying<br><br>
drawings.<br>
FIG. 6 is a flowchart illustrating the process of generating the reduced<br>
MAP information elements according to an embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 6, the base station sets the Reduced Type to ' 1' in order<br>
to indicate that the reduced MAP information elements are prepared at step 601,<br>
and then sets the size of the encoder packet of the uplink burst or the downlink<br>
burst that the terminal transmits and receives in the Nep field at step 602.<br>
The base station inputs the number of bands being allocated to the No.<br>
Band as the code at step 603, and determines whether the number of bands being<br>
allocated is more than '3' at step 604. At this time, if the number of bands being<br>
allocated is less than '3', the base station prepares the first Band Index at step 605,<br>
and confirms whether the No. Band is set to '01' at step 606. At this time, if the<br>
set value is not '01', the base station proceeds to step 609, while if the set value is<br>
'01', the base station prepares the second Band Index at step 607. By contrast, if<br>
the number of bands is more than '3' at step 604, the base station prepares the<br>
allocated bands by Band BITMAP at step 608.<br>
The base station sets the number of bands to the Nband value<br>
determined by the value set in No. Band at step 609, and initializes the temporary<br>
variable i as '0' at step 610. The base station determines whether i is smaller than<br>
N_ and at step 611. At this time, since i is set to '0' at step 610, i is smaller than<br>
N_and. In this case, the base station prepares the number Nsch of band AMC<br>
subchannels to be used in the i-th used band at step 612, increases i by ' 1' at step<br>
613, and then proceeds to step 611 to repeat the above-described processes. If i<br>
becomes larger than N-band at step 611 as i increases through the above-<br>
described repeated processes, the base station terminates its operation.<br>
Next, the process of receiving and interpreting the generated MAP<br>
information elements that is performed by the terminal will be explained with<br>
reference to the accompanying drawings.<br>
FIGs. 7A to 7B are flowcharts illustrating the process of interpreting the<br>
generated MAP information elements according to an embodiment of the present<br>
invention.<br>
Referring to FIGs. 7A and 7B, the terminal confirms the Type field value<br>
by interpreting the received MAP information elements at step 701. At this time,<br>
if the Type field value is not set to '1', the terminal performs the process of<br>
interpreting the MAP information elements for other Types at step 702, and then<br><br>
terminates its operation. By contrast, if the Type field value is set to '1', the<br>
terminal interprets that the MAP allocation is made for the Band AMC channel at<br>
step 703.<br>
The terminal determines whether the MSS ID included in the received<br>
MAP information elements coincides with its own MSS ID allocated during the<br>
initial setting process at step 704. If it does not coincide with its own MSS ID, the<br>
terminal terminates its operation, while if it coincides with its own MSS ID, the<br>
terminal sets the size of the encoder packet of the downlink bursts or the uplink<br>
bursts that the terminal transmits and receives at step 705.<br>
The terminal confirms the value of UL/DL indicator at step 706. If the<br>
value is set to '1', the terminal recognizes this as the uplink MAP allocation at<br>
step 707, and proceeds to step 709. By contrast, if the value is set to '0', the<br>
terminal recognizes this as the downlink MAP allocation at step 708, and then<br>
proceeds to step 709.<br>
The terminal confirms whether No. Band is '11' at step 709. If it is not<br>
' 11', the terminal interprets the following four bits as the first Band Index at step<br>
710, and determines again whether No. Band is '01' at step 711. If it is not '01',<br>
the terminal proceeds to step 714, while if it is '01', the terminal interprets the<br>
following four bits as the second Band Index. By contrast, if No. Band is set to<br>
' 11' as a result of confirmation at step 709, the terminal interprets the following<br>
12 bits in the form of a Band BITMAP at step 713.<br>
The terminal sets the number of interpreted bands to N_band at step 714,<br>
and initializes the temporary variable i as '0' at step 715. Then, the terminal<br>
determines whether i is smaller than N_band at step 716. At this time, since i is<br>
initialized at step 715, it is smaller than N_band. Accordingly, the terminal<br>
interprets the following 5 bits as Nsch at step 717, and determines the position of<br>
the subchannel used in the i-th band designated at step 718 from Nsch. Then, the<br>
terminal increases i by '1' at step 719, and then proceeds again to step 716 to<br>
repeat the above-described operation. If i becomes larger than N_band after<br>
performing the repeated processed, the terminal proceeds to step 720.<br>
The terminal determines whether the UL/DL indicator value is '0' at step<br>
720. If the value is not '0', the terminal terminates its operation, while if the value<br>
is ' 1', the terminal determines whether the UL continue value is ' 1' at step 721. If<br>
the UL continue value is '1', the terminal interprets the following information as<br>
the reduced UL MAP information elements at step 722. By contrast, if the UL<br><br>
continue value is not '1' at step 721, the terminal terminates its operation.<br>
FIG. 8 is a flowchart illustrating the process of interpreting reduced MAP<br>
information elements according to an embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 8, the terminal determines whether the Reduced Type<br>
included in the reduced MAP information elements is set to '1' at step 801. If it is<br>
not '1', the terminal performs the interpreting of the MAP information elements<br>
for the diversity channel at step 802, and terminates its operation. By contrast, if it<br>
is set to '1', the terminal interprets this as the reduced MAP type for the Band<br>
AMC channel at step 803, and then interprets the following four bits as Nep at<br>
step 804.<br>
The terminal confirms whether No. Band is set to ' 11' at step 805. At this<br>
time, if the set value is not '11', the terminal interprets the following four bits as<br>
the first Band Index, and then confirms whether No. Band is '01' at step 807. If<br>
No. Band is not '01', the terminal proceeds to step 810, while if No. Band is '01',<br>
the terminal interprets the following four bits as the second Band Index at step<br>
808.<br>
If No. Band is '11' at step 805, the terminal interprets the 12 bits as the<br>
Band BITMAP at step 809, and then sets the number of bands interpreted at step<br>
810 to N_band. Then, the terminal initializes the temporary variable i as '0' at<br>
step 811. The terminal sets the number of interpreted bands to N_band, and<br>
initializes the temporary variable i to '0' at step 811. Then, the terminal<br>
determines whether i is smaller than N_band at step 812. At this time, since i is<br>
initialized at step 811, it is smaller than N_band. Accordingly, the terminal<br>
interprets the following five bits as Nsch at step 813, and determines the position<br>
of the subchannel used in the i-th band designated at step 814 from Nsch. Then,<br>
the terminal increases i by '1' at step 815, and then proceeds again to step 812 to<br>
repeat the above-described operation. If i becomes larger than N_band after<br>
performing the above-described repeated operation, the terminal terminates its<br>
operation.<br>
As described above, the present invention can construct an efficient MAP<br>
message for allocating frequency bands, coding and modulation methods by<br>
terminals by newly generating and interpreting MAP information elements<br>
required for using the band AMC in a broadband wireless access system.<br>
Additionally, by using a common type in order to represent MAP<br><br>
information of uplink and downlink bursts, it is possible to construct the MAP<br>
information elements for indicating the uplink and downlink burst information as<br>
one, and thus the system overhead used for commonly recognizing the MAP<br>
information elements can be reduced.<br>
While the present invention has been shown and described with reference<br>
to certain preferred embodiments thereof, it will be understood by those skilled in<br>
the art that various changes in form and details may be made therein without<br>
departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention as defined by the<br>
appended claims.<br><br>
