				<td>Technical field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates in general to,, the field of antimicrobials, and more particularly, to compositions and methods to make and recharge antimicrobial additives for polymeric materials.<br>
Background Art<br>
Without limiting the scope of the invention, its background is described in connection with polymeric biocides.<br>
In response to the wide spreading of infectious pathogens (1), antimicrobial polymers, polymers that can effectively inactivate microorganisms upon contact, have attracted considerable interests (2-12). The simplest and most cost-effective method in the preparation of antimicrobial polymeric materials is to directly add antimicrobial additives into polymer structures during processing and has been extensively used in the production of woods, papers, plastics, textiles, coatings, etc. (13-14). Traditionally, the main purpose to add biocides into polymers is to protect the polymeric materials from deterioration and discoloration caused by microbial attacks (15-16). Therefore, some of the antimicrobial additives are actually preservatives, which have low antimicrobial activities and although antimicrobial are very toxic.<br>
Recently, the development of antimicrobial additives that protect both the polymers and the users has become an urgent issue; however, successful examples are still limited (13-16). The major challenge is that to be successful, candidates of antimicrobial additives should meet the following requirements: they should be effective against a broad spectrum of microorganisms at low concentrations; they should have low toxicity to human, animals and the environment; they should be easily and inexpensively synthesized and processed; they should be compatible with the polymer, processing aids and other additives; they should have no negative impact on the properties and appearance of the polymers; they should be stable upon storage; and they should have long-lasting efficacy, etc. (14).<br>
One example of a polymeric biocide is described in United States Patent Application 20030216581, filed by Sun, et al., N-halamine vinyl compounds and their polymeric biocides are described. More particularly, heterocyclic vinylic compounds are described that may be used to form biocidal polymers. The polymers may be used alone or grafted onto textiles, fabrics and polymers. The polymers are readily converted to N-halamine structures on exposure to a halogen source such as commercially available chlorine bleach. The N-halamine derivatives exhibit potent antibacterial properties against microorganisms and these properties are durable and regenerable.<br>
United States Patent 6,762,225, issued to Malik, et al., for light stabilizer composition and teaches a light stabilizer composition obtainable by mixing a polymer with at least one polyalkylpiperidine and at least one free radical generator and melt-blending of that mixture at a temperature above the melting point of the polymer and above the decomposition temperature of the free radical generator and at shear conditions sufficient to blend the components. The light stabilizers of this patent provide a method for enhancing the light stability of polymers, preferably polyolefins.<br>
United States Patent 6,670,412, issued to Erderly, et al., for a method of melt processing amine containing polyethylenes and teaches a processed linear polyethylenes containing an amine additive are shown to exhibit improved processability through the addition of certain surfactants. The amine compounds are generally one or more hindered amine light stabilizers, amine antistats, amine antioxidants or amine based UV inhibitors. Among the melt processing parameters improved are reduced head pressure, reduced torque, reduced motor load, reduced or eliminated melt fracture, or combinations of these parameters.<br>
United States Patent 6,878,761, issued to Gugumus, for synergistic combinations of UV absorbers for pigmented polyolefins and teaches a polyolefin composition which includes an organic pigment, a sterically hindered amine light stabilizer and as UV absorber a mixture of a 2-hydroxyphenyl benzotriazole and a 2-hydroxyphenyl-s-triazine.<br>
Disclosure of the Invention<br>
The present inventors have recognized that "traditional" polymer additives (or their derivatives) may be improved to provide antimicrobial functions. It has been found that the N-halo derivatives of Sterically Hindered Amines (SHAs), which were mainly used as light<br>
stabilizers of polymeric materials, can be such candidates. The majority of commercially important SHAs are piperidine derivatives, which are widely available with low cost and low toxicity (14-18). To date, they are one of the most effective photo-stabilizers of polymeric materials. The N-halo derivatives of SHAs could be readily synthesized by a simple halogenation reaction (19-20). Contrary to other halamines, hindered N-halamines prepared from SHAs are very stable and they were reported to be even better radiation stabilizers than their un-halogenated SHA precursors (21).<br>
The SHA-based N-halamines additives of the present invention have been found to be powerful antimicrobial agents against both gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. The use of the SHA-based N-halamines as novel antimicrobial additives may be used in conjunction with a wide range of polymeric materials.<br>
A method for transformation of conventional and commercially important polymers into durable and rechargeable antimicrobial polymeric materials is described herein. The compositions and methods are used to produce Sterically Hindered N-halo-amine-based antimicrobial polymers. For example, the antimicrobial polymer additive may be a sterically hindered N-halo-amine including the moiety of 2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-N-chloro-4-piperidinyl structure. In some instances the sterically hindered N-halo-amine may have a molecular weight higher than 350 g/mol.<br>
The present invention includes antimicrobial polymer additives having a sterically<br>
hindered N-halo-amine (SHH) structure. For example, the sterically hindered N-halo-amine<br>
may be selected made by mixing one or more of the following: Bis(N-X-2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-<br>
4-piperidyl)   sebacate;   Poly[[6-[( 1,1,3,3-tetramethylbutyl)amino]-s-triazine-2,4-diyl]-N-X-<br>
[(2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-4-piperidyl)imino]-hexamethylene-[(2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-4-<br>
piperidylimino]];       N-X-[(2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-4-piperidyl)    alkyl    formate];    Poly[(6-<br>
morpholino-s-triazine-2s4-diyl)-N-X-[2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-4-piperidyl]imino]-<br>
hexamethylene[(2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-4-piperidyl)imino]];	3-Dodecyl-N-X-(2,2,6,6-<br>
tetramethyl-4-piperidinyl)succinimide;	2,2,4,4-Tetramethyl-N-X-7-oxa-3,20-<br>
diazadispiro[5.1.11.2]-heneicosan-21-one;        D-Glucitol,         l,3:2,4-bis-O-(N-X-2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-4-piperidinylidene); 1 ,r-ethylenebis(N-X-3,3,5,5-tetramethyl-piperazinone); N-X-2,2,4,4-tetramethyl-7-oxa-20-(oxiranylmethyl)-3,20-diazadispiro[5.1.11.2]henicosan-21 -one;   1,2,3,4-Butanetetracarboxylic   acid,   polymer   with   ß,ß,ß', ß'-tetramethyl-2,4,8,10-tetraoxaspiro[5.5]undecane-3,9-diethanol,     N-X-2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-4-piperidinyl      ester;<br>
Poly[oxy[methyl[3-[N-X- (2,2,6,6-tetramethyl4-piperidinyl)-oxy]propyl]silylene]];   1,1',!"-[l,3,5-Triazine-2,4-6-triyltris[(cyclohexyliinino)ethylene]]tris(N-X-3,3,5,5-tetramethyl-piperazinone); mixtures and combinations thereof.<br>
Examples of halides include Cl and Br. A source of halides may be, e.g., sodium di-X-isocyanurate, sodium hypohalite, N-X-succinimide, and calcium hypohalite, wherein X is selected from Cl or Br. The additive may be mixed with polymeric materials prior to, or after halogenation reactions thereof. Generally, the additive is an antimicrobial against gram-negative bacteria such as Escherichia coli (e.g., multi-drug resistant species, such as species that are resistant to sulfonamide) and gram-positive bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus (e.g., multi-drug resistant species, such as species that are resistant to tetracycline, penicillin, streptomycin, and erythromycin) or species that are resistant to the mixtures and combinations or the drugs thereof. The additive may be added to a polymer formed by extrusion, injection molding, hot pressing, coating, painting, solvent casting, mixtures and combinations thereof. Other examples of uses for the additive and polymers formed therewith include, e.g., a bead, a film, a tube, a sheet, a thread, a suture, a gauze, a bandage, an adhesive bandage, a vessel, a container, a cistern, a filter, filaments, yarns, a membrane, a coating, a paint and combinations thereof.<br>
Sterically Hindered N-Halo-amines (SHHs), e.g. Sterically Hindered Chloramines (SHCs) can be formed by the halogenation, e.g. chlorination of Sterically hindered amines. It is found in this invention that SHCs have potent, durable and rechargeable antimicrobial activities against both gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria and also has shown activity against a variety of pathogens including bacteria, virus, spores, fungi, bacteria phage and combinations thereof. For example, the additive is antimicrobial against gram-negative bacteria such as Escherichia coli (e.g., multi-drug resistant species, such as species that are resistant to sulfonamide), and gram-positive bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus (e.g., multi-drug resistant species, such as species that are resistant to tetracycline, penicillin, streptomycin, and erythromycin), or species that are resistant to the mixtures and combinations or the drugs thereof. Different methods may be used to physically add SHCs into conventional and commercially important polymeric materials (e.g., plastics, rubbers, fibers, coatings, paints etc.) as antimicrobial polymer additives in the range of about 0.01 to about 30 weight percent.<br>
Two methods are employed to incorporate SHHs into commercially important polymeric materials. In the first method, SHHs are first synthesized from SHAs and then added into the polymer materials by solution blending and/or thermal blending. The polymers are then processed into desired forms, e.g., a bead, a film, a tube, a sheet, a thread, a suture, a gauze, a bandage, an adhesive bandage, a vessel, a container, a cistern, a filter, a membrane, a coating, a paint and combinations thereof. In the second method, SHAs are added into the polymeric materials by solution and/or thermal blending. The polymers are processed into desired forms, and then treated with halogen sources to transform the SHAs into SHHs, such as treated with chlorine bleach to transform the SHAs into SHCs. Both methods can be readily used to incorporate SHHs into conventional and commercially important polymers to transform them into antimicrobial polymeric materials. The resultant polymeric materials demonstrate potent antimicrobial activities against both gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. Moreover, upon the loss of the antimicrobial activity due to extensive uses and/or prolonged storage, the antimicrobial activity can be easily recharged by a simple halogen-treatment. For instance, the antimicrobial activity may be recharged through the chlorination or bromination of pools and spas, washing, soaking or treating the material in a bleach, or treatment use in a water treatment systems including conduits and<br>
piping.<br><br>
Therefore, the present invention provides simple, practical, flexible, and cost-effective technologies to transform conventional and commercially important polymers into durable and rechargeable antimicrobial polymeric materials, which will find wide applications in medical devices, hospital equipment, water purification/delivery systems, food storage and packaging, hygienic products, consumer products, household items, bio-protective applications and other related challenging environments where self-decontamination of the polymeric material is needed.<br>

FIGURE 1 shows a pathway for the synthesis of two examples of hindered N-halo-amines of the present invention.<br>
Description of the Invention<br>
While the making and using of various embodiments of the present invention are discussed in detail below, it should be appreciated that the present invention provides many applicable inventive concepts mat can be embodied in a wide variety of specific contexts. The specific embodiments discussed herein are merely illustrative of specific ways to make and use the invention and do not delimit the scope of the invention.<br>
To facilitate the understanding of this invention, a number of terms are defined below. Terms defined herein have meanings as commonly understood by a person of ordinary skill in the areas relevant to the present invention. Terms such as "a", "an" and "the" are not intended to refer to only a singular entity, but include the general class of which a specific example may be used for illustration. The terminology herein is used to describe specific embodiments of the invention, but their usage does not delimit the invention, except as outlined in the claims.<br>
As used herein the term "alkyl," by itself or as part of another substiruent, means, unless otherwise stated, a straight or branched chain, or cyclic hydrocarbon radical, or combination thereof, which may be fully saturated, mono- or polyunsaturated and can include di- and multivalent radicals, having the number of carbon atoms designated. Examples of saturated hydrocarbon radicals include groups such as methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, t-butyl, isobutyl, sec-butyl, cyclohexyl, (cyclohexyl)methyl, cyclopropylmethyl, homologs and isomers of, for example, n-pentyl, n-hexyl, n-heptyl, n-octyl, and the like. An unsaturated alkyl group is one having one or more double bonds or triple bonds, e.g., vinyl, 2-propenyl, crotyl, 2-isopentenyl, 2-(butadienyl), 2,4-pentadienyl, 3-(1,4-pentadienyl), ethynyl, 1,- and 3-propynyl, 3-butynyl, and the higher homologs and isomers. The term "alkyl," unless otherwise noted, is also meant to include those derivatives of alkyl defined as "heteroalkyl" or "homoalkyl."<br>
As used herein the term "alkylene" by itself or as part of another substituent means a divalent radical derived from an alkane, as exemplified by --CH2 CH2 CH2 CH2 --, and further includes those groups known as "heteroalkylenes."<br>
As used herein the terms "alkoxy," "alkylamino," "alkylthio" and "thioalkoxy" are used in their conventional sense, and refer to those alkyl groups attached to the remainder of the molecule via an oxygen atom, an amino group or a sulfur atom, respectively.<br>
As used herein the term "heteroalkyl," by itself or in combination with another term, means, unless otherwise stated, a stable straight or branched chain, or cyclic hydrocarbon radical, or combinations thereof, consisting of the stated number of carbon atoms and from one to three heteroatoms selected from the group consisting of O, N, Si and S, and wherein the nitrogen and sulfur atoms may optionally be oxidized and the nitrogen heteroatom may optionally be quatemized. The heteroatom(s) O, N and S may be placed at any interior position of the heteroalkyl group. Examples include --CH2 --CH2 ~O~CH3, --CH2 ~CH2 --NH-CH3, --CH2 -CH2 --N(CH3)-CH3, -CH2 -S-CH2 --CH3, --CH2 --CH2, --S(O)~CH3, -CH2 -CH2 -S(O)2 ~CH3, --CH.dbd.CH--O--CH3, --Si(CH3)3, ~CH2 -CH=N--OCH3, and -CH=CH-N(CH3)-CH3. Up to two heteroatoms may be consecutive, such as, for example, --CH2 --NH--OCH3 and -CH2 --O--Si(CH3)3. Similarly, the term "heteroalkylene" by itself or as part of another substituent means a divalent radical derived from heteroalkyl, as exemplified by -CH2 -CH2 -S-CH2 CH2 - and --CH2 -S-CH2 -CH2 -NH--CH2 --. Still further, for alkylene and heteroalkylene linking groups, no orientation of the linking group is implied.<br><br>
As used herein the terms "cycloalkyl" and "heterocycloalkyl," by themselves or in combination with other terms, represent, unless otherwise stated, cyclic versions of "alky!" and "heteroalkyl," respectively.<br>
As used herein the terms "halo" or "halogen," by themselves or as part of another substituent, mean, unless otherwise stated, fluorine, chlorine, bromine, or iodine atom. Additionally, terms such as "haloalkyl". are meant to include monohaloalkyl and polyhaloalkyl.<br>
As used herein for brevity, the term "aryl" when used in combination with other terms (e.g., aryloxy, arylthioxy, arylalkyl) includes both aryl and heteroaryl rings as defined above. Thus, the term "arylalkyl" is meant to include those radicals in which an aryl group is attached to an alkyl group (e.g., benzyl, phenethyl, pyridylmethyl and the like) including those alkyl groups in which a carbon atom (e.g., a methylene group) has been replaced by, for example, an oxygen atom (e.g., phenoxymethyl, 2-pyridyloxymethyl, 3-(l-naphthyloxy)propyl, and the like).<br>
As used herein the term "acyl" refers to those groups derived from an organic acid by removal of the hydroxy •• portion of the acid. Accordingly, acyl is meant to include, for example, acetyl, propionyl, butyryl, decanoyl, pivaloyl, benzoyl and the like.<br>
Substituents for the alkyl and acyl (including those groups often referred to as alkylene, alkenyl, heteroalkylene, heteroalkenyl, alkynyl, cycloalkyl, heterocycloalkyl, cycloalkenyl, and heterocycloalkenyl) can be a variety of groups selected from: -OR', =O, =NR', =N--OR', -NR'R", --SR', -halogen, --SiR'R"R"', --OC(O)R', -C(0)R', --CO2 R1, --CONR'R", --OC(O)NR'R", --NR" C(O)R', --NR'--C(O)NR"R0'', --NR" C(O)2 R', -NR-C(NRR'R" )=NR'', --NR'C(NR'R" )=NR'" , --NR--C(NR'R" )=NR'", --S(O)R', --S(O)2 R1, -S(O)2 NR'R", -NRSO2 R', --CN and --NO2 in a number ranging from zero to (2m'+l), where m' is the total number of carbon atoms in such radical. R1, R" and R"' each independently refer to hydrogen, and heteroalkyl, unsubstituted aryl, aryl substituted with halogens, unsubstituted alkyl, alkoxy or thioalkoxy groups, or aryl-(C1 -C10)alkyl groups. When a compound of the invention includes more than one R group, for example, each of the R groups is independently selected as are each R', R" and R'" groups when more than one of these groups is present. When R' and R" are attached to the same nitrogen atom, they can be combined with the nitrogen atom to form a 5-, 6-, or 7-membered ring. As used herein, the term "heteroatom" is meant to include oxygen (O), nitrogen (N), sulfur (S) and silicon (Si).<br>
Sterically hindered N-halo-amines are a class of novel rechargeable disinfectants, e.g., N-halamines. Currently, N-halamine-based antimicrobial polymers are produced by three major methods, including functional modification of the polymers, (co)polymerization of polymerizable N-halamine precursors and grafting of polymerizable N-halamine precursors onto the target polymers. Each of these technologies is suitable for the treatment of certain polymers, but a "universal" technology that can treat most conventional and commercially important polymeric materials has not been developed yet. Furthermore, the current technologies involve one or more chemical modifications to prepare the final antimicrobial polymeric materials, which inevitably requires new/special steps and increases cost in the transformation of ordinary polymeric materials into antimicrobial polymers. The present inventors recognized that these difficulties are part of the reasons why commercially important antimicrobial polymers have not been developed.<br>
In this invention, sterically hindered N-halo-amines are physically mixed with<br><br>
conventional and commercially important polymeric materials as antimicrobial additives. As<br>
long as the target polymeric materials can be dissolved in solvent(s), or can be melted, they can be manufactured into SHHs-containing polymeric materials, providing durable and rechargeable antimicrobial activities. Because dissolving and melting are conventional processing steps in the manufacturing of most polymeric materials, the present invention provides a universal technology to produce antimicrobial polymers. For polymeric materials that are not soluble and/or meltable, SHHs can be painted or coated onto the polymeric materials.<br>
Furthermore, sterically hindered N-halo-amines used in the present invention are synthesized by a halogenation, e.g., chlorination, treatment of sterically hindered amines either before or after mixing with polymeric materials. Sterically hindered amines are one of the most important photo-stabilizers of polymers, which are none or low toxic, widely available and relative inexpensive.<br>
In summary, compared with the current technologies, the present invention provides simple, practical, flexible and cost-effective approaches to transform conventional and commercially important polymers into antimicrobial polymeric materials. The present invention will find widespread use hi numerous areas of application. For example, soluble and/or meltable polymers can be manufactured into durable and rechargeable antimicrobial materials, and a wide range of surfaces can be transformed into durable and rechargeable antimicrobial materials by coating and or coating using this invention. The present invention is also suitable for the treatment of plastics, rubbers, paints, coatings, and fibers, including, but not limited to, polyolefins, polystyrene and its derivatives, ABS, EPDM, cellulose acetate, polyurethane, etc.<br>
The simple, practical, flexible and cost-effective sterically hindered N-halo-amines disclosed herein may be used as polymer additives in the range of about 0.01 to about 30.0 weight percent (wt%), the. typical range is about 0.2 to about 5.0 wt%. Both solution and thermal blending can be used in the treatment. Sterically hindered N-halo-amines can be formed before or after mixing. The present invention will find wide applicability because it requires no new treatment steps, training and/or new equipment used in the transformation of conventional and commercially important polymers into durable and rechargeable antimicrobial materials.<br>
The applications for use of the present invention include, e.g. antimicrobial treatment of plastics, rubbers, paints, coatings and fibers. The resulting materials may find plications in medical devices, hospital equipment, water purification/delivery systems, food storage and food packaging, hygienic products, consumer products, household items, bio-protective applications, and other related challenging environments where self-decontamination of the polymeric material is needed.<br>
One of the advantages of the present invention is that sterically hindered N-halo-<br>
amines are derivatives of commercially available sterically hindered amines (SHAs) based<br>
light stabilizers derived from 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine (14-17). Commercially important<br>
SHAs have carefully designed and balanced structures to improve their compatibility with<br>
the target polymers to enhance long-term retention of the additive during ageing of the<br>
polymers. The present invention uses commercially available SHAs based on 2,2,6,6-<br>
tetramethylpiperidine with a molecular weight higher than 350 g/mol; however the skilled<br>
artisan will recognize that polymers under 350 g/mol may also be used with the present<br>
invention. Listed below are, but not limited to, examples of the SHAs used hi this invention<br>

 Exemplary description of the Synthesis of the Sterically Hindered N-Halo-amines. Example 1: SHC-1. A solution of sodium dichloroisocyanurate (DCCANa, about 8.8 grams, about 0.04mol) in water (about 40ml) was added to a solution of about 9.6 grams (about 0.04 mol) SHA-1 in toluene (about 20ml). The mixture was vigorously shaken for about 10 minutes. Toluene (about 10ml) was then added. The precipitated cyanuric acid was filtered off. The organic layer was separated from water. After the evaporation of toluene, the solid was collected and recrystallized from petroleum ether to produce a yield of 77%, a melting temperature of 83°C and an active chlorine content of 12.5%.<br>

Antimicrobial properties of the synthesized SHCs. The bacteria used in this study are as follows; Escherichia coli, gram-negative, ATCC 15597; Staphylococcus aureus, gram-positive, ATCC 6538; Escherichia coli, gram-negative, resistant to sulfonamide, ATCC 29214; and Staphylococcus aureus subsp. aureus, gram-positive, resistant to tetracycline, penicillin, streptomycin, and erythromycin and ATCC 14154. Although, the skilled artisan will recognize that other bacteria may be treated with the present invention.<br>
Antimicrobial Procedure: SHC samples were crushed into powders. A standard sieve was used to collect the powders in the 60-80 mesh (about 0.42-0.31mm) range. One gram of each sample was packed into a column (I.D.: about 6mm). About 1 nil of an aqueous suspension containing about 106-7 CFU/mL (colony forming units per milliliter) of the bacteria was passed through the columns containing the corresponding samples. The flow rate was controlled by compressed air (about 0.1-10 ml/min). The effluent was collected, serially diluted, and each dilution was placed onto nutrient agar plates. The same procedure was also applied to the un-chlorinated SHAs powders as control. Bacterial colonies on plates were counted after incubatipn at about 37°C for about 24 hours. Results: No bacteria growth was observed on the agar plates after about 24 hours of incubation, i.e. the Sterically Hindered N-Halo-amines provided total kill of the microorganisms under the test conditions mentioned above.<br><br>
Durability and Rechargeability of the SHCs. Durability: After storage under ambient conditions (e.g., temperature about 25°C ± 3, humidity about 60±10%) for a certain period of time, the active chlorine contents in the SHC samples were titrated and the results were listed in Table 3.<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
 Rechargeability: The SHC powders were neutralized by immersing in about 0.1 mol/L sodium thiosulfate solution at room temperature under shaking for about 30 minutes, and then chlorinated according to the synthesis procedures mentioned above. After each chlorination, the samples were washed thoroughly with a large amount of distilled water. The active chlorine contents of the SHC samples after about 50 cycles of "neutralization-chlorination" treatment were essentially unchanged.<br>
Preparation and antimicrobial activities of commercially important polymers containing Sterically Hindered N-Halo-amines. To incorporate SHCs into commercially important polymeric materials, two methods were developed. In the first method, SHA samples were added into polymeric materials by conventional processing technologies including extrusion, injection molding, thermal pressing, coating, painting or solvent casting. Then, the SHA-containing samples were halogenated to transfer SHAs into SHHs. In the second method, SHAs were first transferred into SHHs and then incorporated into commercially important polymers by extrusion, injection molding, thermal pressing, coating, painting or solvent casting. Both methods are feasible approaches to incorporate SHHs into polymeric materials and the resultant polymeric materials demonstrated potent, durable and rechargeable antimicrobial activities.<br>
Preparation of antimicrobial polymeric materials using the first method disclosed hereinabove and the antimicrobial activities of the resultant polymers. Incorporating SHAs into polymers: The additives of the present invention were formed into polymers by extrusion, injection molding, coating, painting, hot pressing and solvent casting; typical examples are described below:<br>

The extruded PP tube from the die of the extruder was under the traction of the CSI-194T Take Up Apparatus.<br>
Example 6: Making SHA-containing PE sheets, about 10 grams of PE pellets and about 0.02 grams of SHA-2 powders (about 0.2 wt% of PE) were mixed, homogenized for 5min, and then injection molded into a sheet of 1mm thickness. The machine used was a<br>
Minimax Laboratory Molder equipment with a test mould. The temperature of the mixing cup was about 160°C. Test mould was kept at ambient temperature.<br>
Example 7: Making SHA-containing PP films. About 20 grams of PP pellets and 0.4 grams of SHA-1 powders (about 2 wt% of PP) were mixed and homogenized on a Minimax Laboratory Molder at about 180°C for about 5 minutes. Then the blended materials were hot pressed into about a 300 um thickness film at about 180°C for about 30 seconds using a hot press.<br>

Durability: All polymer samples (e.g., films, sheets, fibers, paints, coating, and tubes) were stored under ambient conditions (temperature: about 25°C ± 3, humidity: about 60 ± 10%). The active chlorine content in sample was determined by titration at intervals of<br>
2, 4 and 6 months.  For all polymer samples, the active chlorine content was unchanged within 6 months. Two typical examples were listed in Table 5.<br>

(Table Removed)<br>
Rechargeability: Chlorinated polymer samples (e.g., films, sheets, coating, paints, and tubes) were treated in about 0.1 mol/L sodium thiosulfate solution at room temperature for about 30 minutes under constant shaking. After treatment, the samples were thoroughly washed with distilled water, and then bleached again according to the procedure described above. After each chlorination the samples were washed thoroughly with a large amount of distilled water. The active chlorine contents of the samples after about 50 cycles of "neutralization-chlorination" treatments were essentially unchanged.<br>

The applications for the present invention cover a spectrum of products, from healthcare professional uses to the broader areas of sanitation, infection and odor control in military and institutional hygienic practices. The present invention also includes consumer uses especially in the hospitality industry, athletic wear and sports facilities sectors. These uses are fueled in recent times by an explosion of concern about new infectious disease problems, such as HIV/AIDS and avian influenza, the growing risk from antibiotic-resistant bacteria such as MRS A and VRE, and the age-old problems of hepatitis, tuberculosis, and E. coli.<br>
For example, public awareness and institutional costs of hospital-acquired infections is fueling the search for better products. Food industries have become acutely aware of the risks from various bacteria such as the deadly E. coli O157:H7. The food industry has also become increasingly vulnerable to liability with the advent of better detection methods that<br><br>
can now trace food illness back to its source. The world's militaries have never solved the problem of fungal growth (e.g., "jungle rot") for soldiers on patrol that must wear their clothes for long periods between launderings. Fungal growth can result in discomfort and infection leading to a loss of manpower.<br>
The plastics and fabrics made using the present invention are anti-bacterial, anti-viral, anti-fungal and anti-odor with activity greater than silver-impregnated plastics and fabrics, the next-best approach. The present invention includes plastic parts, films, tubing, cotton and synthetic fabrics and antimicrobial plastic additive that are antimicrobial in nature. The plastic additive is compatible with standard plastics including PET, polyethylene, PVC, polypropylene, and polystyrene. Fiber and fabric manufacturers can use the plastic additive without altering their normal fiber extrusion process. Polyester, nylon, and polypropylene fabrics can now be made permanently antimicrobial.<br>
Additionally, low-melt-temperature plastics such as polystyrene, PVC and Polyethylene can be pre-chlorinated by adding the present invention to plastics to include non-woven fabrics, e.g., masks, wipes, shoe and head covers, diapers, wound care, and disposable healthcare fabrics, disposable medical plastics and packaging e.g., medical packaging to ensure sterility, food packaging to protect against bacteria, anti-mold packaging to extend shelf-life. Additional applications of the present invention are listed in Tables 6 and 7 below, Table 6<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
