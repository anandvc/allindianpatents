Scheme I, below, summarizes the three stages of the novel synthetic pathway used to prepare eprosartan.<br>
SCHEME I<br>
(Scheme Removed)<br>
According to Scheme I, 2-n-butyl-4-formylimidazole is treated with a base, such as l,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene (DBU) or 1,1,3,3-tetramethylguanidine, followed by reaction with a regioselective nitrogen-protecting reagent, such as methyl acrylate, ethyl acrylate, acetyl bromide, chloromethyl pivalate (POM-C1) or di-te/T-butyl dicarbonate, to give derivatization on the least hindered nitrogen atom of the imidazole ring. This reaction can be carried out in ethyl acetate, ace torn tnle, toluene, DMF, THF or l-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone (NMP). Preferably, this reaction is carried out using DBU and methyl acrylate or ethyl acetate in ethyl acetate at 50-60 °C. Typically, the Scheme 1-1 compound is then reacted with (2-thienylmethyOpropanedioic acid, mono-ethyl ester in a suitable solvent, such as toluene, acetonitrile, DMF, THF, NMP, or DMSO, in the presence of a catalyst, for example, in the presence of piperidine or piperidinium propicnate in excess propionic acid, at a suitable temperature, such as a temperature of about 70 °C to<br><br>
about 100 °C. Preferably, this reaction is carried out using piperidine in toluene at a reflux temperature of 65 °C-70 °C; this reflux temperature is obtained by placing the reaction mixture under reduced pressure. The quaternary salt of the Scheme 1-2 compound is then prepared by reacting this compound with a benzyl halide, such as methyl or ethyl 4-(bromomethyl)benzoate, or a benzyl mesylate or tosylate at elevated temperatures, for example, at temperatures of 100-120 °C, preferably at 105-110 °C  The ester groups are hydrolyzed and the N-protecting group is removed using, for example, base, such as aqueous sodium or potassium hydroxide, to give eprosartan (Scheme 1-3). Thereafter, pharmaceutically acceptable salts may be prepared as described above.<br>
Alternately, eprosartan can be prepared as summarized in Scheme II, below.<br>
SCHEME II<br><br>
(Scheme Removed) <br><br><br><br>
According to Scheme n, the order of the first and second steps detailed in Scheme I have been reversed. In this synthetic sequence, 2-n-butyl-4-formylimidazole is reacted with (2-thienylmethyl)propanedioic acid, mono-ethyl<br><br>
ester in the presence of a catalyst, and then the product from this reaction is regioselectively N-protected. Quatemization and basic work-up is carried out as detailed in Scheme I to give eprosartan.<br>
Also included in the scope of the present invention are the novel intermediates used in the preparation of eprosartan. These intermediates are described hereinbefore.<br>
The invention is illustrated by the following example. The example is not intended to limit the scope of this invention as defined hereinabove and as claimed hereinbelow.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
Example 1<br>
Preparation of (E)-α-[[2-Butyl-l-f(4-carboxyphenyl)-methyl]]-lH-imidazol-5-yllmethylenel-2-thiophene propanoic acid fEorosartan)<br>
(Formula Removed)<br><br>
Stagefl: Preparation of	<br>
A heterogeneous solution of 2-n-butyl-4-formylimidazole (155.0 kg, 1018 mol) in ethyl acetate (775.0 L) was treated at room temperature with methyl acrylate (131.5 kg, 1527 mol) followed with l,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene (DBU, 7.75 kg, 50.9 mol). The reaction mixture was then heated to 50-60 °C (the mixture became completely homogeneous when heated) and stirred at that temperature until the reaction was complete (approximately 2 hours). The excess methyl acrylate and the ethyl acetate were distilled off under vacuum, maintaining the base temperature below 60 °C. The residual bronze-colored oil, containing the above-noted Stage 1 product, was diluted with toluene (1033 L) and was used in the next step without further purification.<br><br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
Staget2: Preparation of<br>
The crude Stage 1 product from above was treated with (2-thienylmethyl)-propanedioic acid, mono-ethyl ester (267.3 kg @ 100%, 1171 mol) and piperidine (21.7 kg, 255 mol). The resulting solution was heated to reflux (65-70 °C) under reduced pressure; the water produced during the reaction was removed by the Dean-Stark method. Reflux was continued until the reaction was complete (approximately 2-3 hours). The reaction mixture was cooled to 55-60 °C and was washed with a 20% w/w brine solution (485.3 L) and demineralised water (485.3 L) to remove much of the piperidine catalyst. The toluene was then removed by vacuum distillation, maintaining the base temperature below 60 °C. The residual bronze-colored oil, containing the Stage 2 product, was used in the next step without further purification.<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
Staget3: Preparation of<br>
The residual oil containing the crude Stage 2 product was diluted with toluene (583.0 L). The resulting solution was treated with solid methyl 4-(bromomethyl)-benzoate (291.6 kg @ 100%, 1273 mol) and was subsequently stirred at 70-75 °C for 30 minutes to ensure that a homogeneous solution was obtained. The toluene was distilled off under vacuum, maintaining the process temperature between 60 and 75 °C. The resulting thick oil was heated at 95-100 °C until the reaction was shown to be complete (approximately 6-10 hours). The reaction mixture was cooled to 75-80 °C and diluted with IMS (ethanol containing 1% v/v MeOH, 1534.0 L). An aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide [203.7 kg (5093 mol) dissolved in demineralised water (936.0 L)] was prepared and added to the ethanolic solution of the intermediate quaternary salt. The mixture was heated<br><br>
to reflux (approximately 80 °C) and reflux was continued until the hydrolysis to the title compound was complete (approximately 2 hours). The reaction mixture was cooled to 50-60 °C and treated with aqueous 6 N hydrochloric acid solution (approximately 479.0 L, 2874 mol) until a pH of 5.1 to 5.3 was achieved. The resulting slurry was cooled to 10-15 °C and was held at that temperature for approximately 2 hours to complete the precipitation. The slurry was filtered and the wet cake was washed with 50% v/v aqueous IMS (approximately 520 L) and water (approximately 1790 L) to afford 344.9 kg (estimated 66.9% yield over the three stages) of the title compound as a beige-colored wet solid.<br>
