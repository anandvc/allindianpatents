Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of 'Docetaxel'.   Docetaxel is also known as 'Taxotere', a trademark of Rhone-poulenc Rorer and it is a taxane derivative having potent anti-tumor activity. The present invention more particularly relates to a short synthesis of docetaxel of formula (1) following a semi-synthetic route comprising C-13 esterification of a suitably protected 10-Deacetylbaccatin III with a suitably protected side chain acid and subsequent deprotections to produce docetaxel.<br><br>
'Paclitaxel' having the formula (2), widely known as 'Taxol' in chemical literature is a naturally occurring compound from the bark of Pacific as well as Himalayan Yew tree and exhibits a broad spectrum of anti-tumor activity. It has been approved in various countries for use in the treatment of ovarian and breast cancers and clinical trials are under progress in many countries for its use in several other types of cancers as well. During the time of human clinical trials of Paclitaxel of the formula (2), a number of SAR (Structure Activity Relationship) studies on taxol were carried out all over the world and highlighted the crucial structural features which are responsible for its anti-cancer activity. Consequently, several structural modifications were attempted on taxol at specific positions in baccatin III part as well as in side chain acid part which presumably do not diminish the anti-cancer activity of ta.xol molecule.<br><br>
Docetaxel of the formula (1) is one such synthetic derivative of paclitaxel of the formula (2) which showed most promising anti-tumor activity in clinical trials. It was developed as an anti-cancer drug by Rhone-Poulenc Rorer for the treatment of cancer. Docetaxel has been approved in several countries for the treatment of breast cancer recently. Docetaxel has the molecular formula (1), which is similar to paclitaxel of the formula (2) except that a free hydroxyl group at C-10 position of baccatin part and a t-butoxycarbonyl (t-boc) group at C-3' nitrogen of the side chain acid part.<br><br>
Since the total synthesis of docetaxel or paclitaxel is not a commercially viable process due to the lengthy synthetic steps as well as the high cost involved, the option of a semi-synthetic approach to paclitaxel or docetaxel has been persued in several laboratories starting from a precursor molecule 10-deacetylbaccatin III (10-DAB III) of the formula (3)<br><br><br>
Compared to paclitaxel having the formula (2), 10-deacetylbaccatin III (10-DAB III) of the formula (3) is a relatively abundant precursor molecule obtained from several species of the Yew tree (genus Taxus) grown in various parts of the world. Considering the relative chemical reactivity differences of the four hydroxyl groups (C-1, C-7, C-10 &amp; C-13) in 10-DAB III of the formula (3), it is necessary to protect the C-7, &amp; C-10 hydroxyl groups before undertaking the esterification of C-13 hydroxyl group in the compound of the formula (3) to produce docetaxel of the formula (1) or paclitaxel of the formula (2). Although a few synthetic approaches were estabhshed for the efficient esterification of highly hindered C-13 hydroxyl group in the compound of the formula (3), very few 7, 10-protected 10-deacetylbaccatin III precursors were known in the literature for such esterification processes. Since the C-7 hydroxyl group in compound of the formula (3) is highly vulnerable to epimerisation under basic reaction conditions, selection of a suitable and easily removable protecting group for C-7 OH is a crucial parameter in a semi-synthetic approach for the synthesis of docetaxel or paclitaxel. Secondly, the esterification of the side chain acid with sterically hindered C-13 hydroxyl group in suitably protected 10-deacetylbaccatin III is another parameter which requires considerable attention. Finally, easy accessibility of a suitably protected chiral side chain acid of the formula (4),<br><br><br>
where R' &amp; R^ independently represent hydrogen, lower alkyl, phenyl, substituted phenyl groups which corresponds to the side chain acid part of the docetaxel of the fomiula (1) and a , cost effective method of the side chain acid preparation also accounts for a salient feature of a good synthesis of both docetaxel as well as paclitaxel.<br>
In continuation of our research activities in taxane chemistry, we initiated our efforts to develop a short and cost effective approach for the synthesis of docetaxel of the fomiula (1). Consequently, we recognized the need for a new protecting group for C-7 and C-10 hydroxyl groups in 10-deacetylbaccatin III of the formula (3), which can be easily deprotected under mild reaction conditions. Accordingly, we developed new and an improved semi-synthetic process for the synthesis of docetaxel of the formula (1) using an imidazolylcarbonyl group as C-7 and C-10 hydroxy protecting group. Therefore the present invention involves a novel and an efficient semi-synthetic approach comprising a short synthetic sequence and milder reaction conditions to produce docetaxel of the formula (1).<br>

1.8g of 10-deacetylbaccatin III of the formula (3) was treated with 2.65g of 1.1.-carbonyldipiperidine (5 equiv.) dissolved in 170ml of dry dichloromethane and stirred at 25 °C till the starting material was consumed as seen by TLC. The reaction mixture was then<br><br>
diluted with dichloromethane and washed with water brine solution and dried over anh. sodium sulfate. Concentration of the solvent afforded 2.7g of crude solid, which was washed with 30ml of chloroform. The organic layer was separated and the resulting solid was dried under vacuum over it to get 1.2 g of the title compound in 96% HPLC purity.<br>
Advantages of the invention:<br>
(1) The process involves a simple three step semi-synthetic approach using abundantly available naturally occurring compound 10-deacetylbaccatin III as the starting material.<br>
(2)	A new one step synthetic process was developed for the protection of both C-7 and C-10 hydroxy groups present in 10-deacetylbaccatin III without encountering epimerisation of C-7 substiment. the protecting group used in this process is also a novel protecting group as far as taxane chemistry is concerned.<br>
(3)	The purification methods used for each of the process steps were simple enough for getting consistent results in terms of yields and purity of the products.<br>
(4)	The process steps involves simple organic acids and bases available at low cost and milder reaction conditions which gave the intermediate products in high yields.<br>
(5)	Finally, the novelty of the present invention includes (i) single step protection of both the C-7 &amp; C-10 hydroxyl groups in 10-deacetylbaccatin III in high yields (ii) single step deprotection oi three protecting groups at C-7, C-10 &amp; oxazolidine moiety in step (iii) of the process.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
3.	The process as claimed in claims 1-2, wherein the solvent used in step (i) is selected<br>
from 1,4-dioxane, dimethoxyethane, tetrahydrofuran, benzene, toluene, dichloroethane. dichloromethane or chloroform.<br>
4.	The process as claimed in claims 1-3, wherein the carbodimide or carbonate base is selected from dicyclohexyl carbodiimide or dipyridylcarbonate.<br>
5.	The process as claimed in claims 1-4, wherein the solvent used in the step (ii) of the process of the present invention is selected from dichloromethane, chloroform. 1.2-dichloroethane, carbon tetrachloride , benzene, toluene, hexane. 1,2-dichlorobenzene. xylene, diethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran. 1,2-dimethoxyethane. dimethylformamide or dimethylacetamide.<br>
6.	The process as claimed in claims 1-5, wherein the temperature used in the step (li) of the process of the present invention is in the range of 20 to 40 °C.<br>
7.	The process as claimed in claims 1-6, wherein the acid used in the step (iii) of the process of the present invention is selected from the organic acids such as fomic acid, acetic acid or trifluoroacetic acid.<br>
8.	The process as claimed in claims 1-7, wherein the solvent used in the step (iii) of the process of the present invention is selected from water, tetrahydrofuran. diethyl ether. A-dioxane, acetonitrile, methanol or ethanol.<br>
9.	The process as claimed in claims 1-8, wherein the temperature used in the step (iii) of the process of the present invention is in the range of-5 to 5 °C.<br>
10.	The process as claimed in claims 1-9. wherein the base used in step (iv) of the process of the present invention is selected from sodium carbonate, sodium dicarbonate or potassium carbonate.<br><br>
11.	The process as claimed in claims 1-10, wherein the solvent used in step (iv) of the process of the present invention is selected from tetrahydrofuran, diethylether, 1,4-dioxane, 1,2-dimethoxyethane or ethylacetate.<br>
