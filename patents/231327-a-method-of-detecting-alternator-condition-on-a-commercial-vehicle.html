SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR DETECTING ALTERNATOR CONDITION<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[OOOIJ	This invention relates to a system and method for detecting alternator conditions,<br>
and more specifically, to a system and method of detecting alternator conditions using an electrical control unit (ECU) to process measurements of the vehicle battery.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002]	A vehicle's alternator is essential to the vehicle's operation.   The failure of the<br>
alternator can cause significant problems, especially in the labor, down time, and material replacement expenses. Adding to the cost is the expense of towing or repairing the vehicle when a breakdown occurs out in the field. Also, depending on the cargo, late delivery, or damage, can result in significant monetaiy loss. Early detection of the alternator's impending failure would be helpful in allowing repair and/or replacement of a faulty alternator before the alternator fails when the vehicle is in the field. Early detection is usually possible since alternator failure is typically not a sudden event.<br>
[0003]	Known methods for detecting alternator condition include the measurement of the<br>
voltage from the alternator. Such methods may include detectmg the frequency of the waveform generated by the alternator and comparing it to a threshold value, or comparing the absolute voltage measurement to a standardized threshold voltage. However, such methods have proven to be ineffective and difficuh to implement. Many of the tools on the market require the vehicle to be stationary and are typically used in the maintenance garage. Frequently the detection of ahemator failure is too late, or after the fact. The traditional method of measuring the condition of an alternator includes disassembly of the alternator and testing the individual diodes. This method is not cost effective and does not provide a continuous monitoring system of the alternator condition.<br>
[0004]	Accordingly, a need exists for a system and method for monitoring the condition<br>
of an altemator, wherein reliable data can be obtained in a cost-effective, real-time manner.<br>
BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0005]	A system and method for detecting altemator condition is provided. Voltage data<br>
is taken from a power supply system and manipulated to determine whetber or not the altemator is functioning property. In one embodiment, voltage data is taken over a predetermined period of time and sent to the vehicle ECU. hi one specific embodiment, the ECU is the antilocking brake system ECU.   The system voltage is measured at different engine speeds and the difference<br><br>
between the ripple amplitude at the different engine speeds is compared to determine the condition of the alternator.<br>
I0006I	Another aspect of the present invention is a system for determining alternator<br>
condition. In one embodiment, the system includes the alternator, a battery, an ECU and one or more communication buses. The communication buses are used to determine relevant parameters such as engine speed, and also to transmit the status of the altemator condition. In one specific embodiment, the ECU is the vehicle antilocking brake system ECU and the communication bus is either the J1587 Diagnostic, J2497 PLC Communications, or JI939 Controller Area Network buses.<br>

altemator.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[00012]	Figure 1 illustrates a typical electrical system of a vehicle, such as, for example, a<br>
commercial vehicle, generally designated by reference number 10. The principal components of this system 10 are the battery 20, powerline 25, altemator 3D vehicle ECU 40, and communications bus 45. It should be noted by one skilled in the art that the battery voltage is the voltage measured across the powerline 25. While the embodiment discussed in this application is generally directed to the use of the vehicle antilocking brake system (ABS) ECU, it should be appreciated that a different or separate ECU can be used, or a separate circuit, and therefore is covered within the scope of this application. The battery 20 and altemator 30 and ECU 40 are all connected to the same powerline 25 which provides information to the vehicle ECU 40. Such information can be transferred to the vehicle ECU 40 by one or more electrical buses 45. The communication bus 45 can be a pre-existing vehicle bus, such as, for example, the J1587, J2497 or J1939 buses, or can be a new bus installed on the vehicle for the detection of the altemator condition, or other puiposes, such as measurement of engine speed.    The J1587 link is the<br><br>
commonly used diagnostic bus for installed electronic controllers.   The JI939 link is used for engine to transmission communication.<br>
(00013]	The analog voltage from the vehicle battery 20 can be measured at appropriate<br>
intervals and processed into a digital sample voltage data U by an A/D converter. The sample<br>
voltage data U can then be used in connection with engine RPM data obtained from<br>
communication link 45. This information is inputted into an alternator condition determining<br>
algorithm, such as the one disclosed in this application, to determine the condition of the<br>
alternator. Additionally, if the algorithm detects a faulty or partially faulty alternator, the vehicle<br>
ECU 40 can send a signal to the operator indicating the failure or partial failure of the alternator<br>
30. For example, the signal can be sent to the vehicle cabin in the fonn of an audio signal or a<br>
visual signal, or it can be processed into a display that provides a diagnosis on one or more parts<br>
of the vehicle. Operator warning can also be provided by the vehicle communication bus 45.<br>
[00014]	The method for determining the condition of an alternator 30 is based on<br>
measurements of the electrical system voltage from the powerline 25 at specified engine RPM values. . As shown in Figure 2, as the battery voltage U is measured over a range of engine speeds, the data provides for a fairly uniform measurement about the average battery voltage U. However, the measured signal is DC value with a ripple component having a ripple amplitude AU, a maximum voltage Umax, and a minimum voltage Umin. that oscillates about the average battery voltage U. For example, as shown in Figure 2, a typical 12V battery with an alternator in good condition will produce a signal with an average battery voltage tj of 13.2 volts. The ripple amplitude AU in such conditions will be nominal, such that the maximum ripple, the difference between Umax and Umin (or AUmH»), will be less than 2 volts.<br>
[00015]	As shown in Figure 3a, the average battery voltage IJ and the ripple amplitude AU<br>
increase with increasing engine revolutions per minute (RPM) for a partially good alternator. For a specific case, as shown in Figure 3a, the change in AU at high engine RPM compared to at idle engine RPM is approximately 4.4 volts. However, the change in AU is dependent on the nature of the failure. As such, a partial failure of a vehicle's alternator is best detected when the difference in the AU at mid-range engine RPM (approximately 1,000-1,500) and at idle engine RPM (approximately 500-900) is less than two times AU at idle engine RPM. It should be appreciated by one skilled in the art that the data above has been produced using specific engines, ahemators, and batteries (12V, 24V, etc) that are typical of the industry; however data that varies from these calculations due to differences in the equipment used can still be used to determine alternator condition under a different set of indicating parameters. As shown in Figure 3b, a failed alternator has an average battery voltage V approximately equal to the battery voltage, i.e. approximately 12V, and does not increase with increasing engine RPM.   As the system 10<br><br>
continues to operate, the battery will begin to have voltage readings below 12V.   The average<br>
battery voltage U will continue to dissipate over time and the battery will die in a relatively short<br>
amount of time.  Depending on the nature of alternator failure, the battery composition, and the<br>
time failure was first detected, this time may range from several minutes to a couple hours.<br>
[00016]	As an illustrative example, the algorithm for monitoring and detecting alternator<br>
failure can include the following steps. Such an illustrative algorithm is shown in Figure 4. In step 100, the ABS ECU samples the poweriine voltage. In this embodiment, 20 KHZ was determined a sufficient sampling rate. In optional step 110, data can be filtered or weighted to accommodate for changes in battery loads, PLC Communications, or other conditions that may skew the data. For example, the ECU can look for idle line of the PLC before using the data gathered. In step 120, the ECU then determines the average battery voltage U, the ripple amplitude AU, the maximum battery voltage Umax and the minimum battery voltage Umin during a sample period. Optionally, the ECU can clear these values and obtain a new sample set for a given period of time, every ten seconds, for example.<br>
(00017]	In step 130, the ECU determines if U is below a predetermined threshold value,<br>
preferably approximately 12V. If the ECU determines that average battery voltage tJ is less than the threshold value for a predetermined time interval, the ECU proceeds to step 140 wherein a signal is sent to indicate the alternator failure. If the ECU determines that average battery voltage U is not less than the threshold value, the ECU then proceeds to step 150 wherein the ECU processes the data related to the engine speed (in RPM). The ECU can receive this signal from the J1939, or J1587 vehicle data buses, or from some other data bus. In step 150, the ECU determines if the data collected was at a different engine RPM than the previous data (or if the data was the first data set). In Step 180, the data set is taken at a different engine speeds. A different engine speed is a predetennined difference, wherein the difference is great enough to provide practical data. In the preferred embodiment, the different engine speeds that should be measured should fall into each of one of the idle engine speed (500-900 RPM) and a midrange engine speed (1,000-1,500 RPM).<br>
[00018)	If at step 190, the ECU detects two different engine speed data sets, the ECU<br>
determines AUr,fio calculated fi-om ripple amplitude AU at the second engine RPM (preferably mid-range engine speed) divided by the ripple amplitude AU at the first engme RPM (preferably idle engine speed). At step 200, the ECU determines if the AUratio is greater than a certain threshold. . If AUratio is greater than that value, then the ECU signals a partial alternator failure, at step 210, and then starts taking samples again at step 100. Additionally, more than 2 engine RPM values can be measured, or a linear equation could be used to obtain AUratio for any given RPM.   Optionally, the ECU can store the alternator data and produce a partial alternator signal<br><br>
after processing a given number of alternator failing AUratio readings.   If AUratio is not greater<br>
than approximately 2, the algorithm loops back to step 100 and starts to take new data.<br>
Optionally, the ECU can send a signal to indicate a good alternator at step 230.<br>
I00019J	It will be appreciated that the system for determining alternator condition may<br>
adopt a wide variety of configurations and the method for determining alternator condition may take into account a number of variations, including additional variables. This invention is intended to include such modifications and alterations in so far as they fall within the scope of the appended claims or the equivalents thereof.<br><br><br>
