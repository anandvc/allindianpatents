FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to a composite material of a base body with a multi-layer coating. Such<br>
composite bodies are, for example, used as cutting inserts for machining purposes, namely,<br>
turning, milling or boring. The base bodies, to which the coating can be applied by physical<br>
or chemical vapor deposition processes. (PVD or CVD), can be composed of hard metal, a<br>
cermet, steel or a ceramic.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
DE 27 36 982 A1 already describes a wear resistant coating for shaped parts, especially for<br>
tools, comprised of a shaped body, preferably of hard metal, and one or more surface<br>
coatings, at least one of which is a protective layer with a ceramic matrix into which a further<br>
material is incorporated. The ceramic matrix and the material incorporated therein have<br>
different coefficients of thermal expansion so that the protective layer is subject to the<br>
formation of fine microcracks therein. Unstabilized and/or partially stabilized ZrO2 has been<br>
proposed as the material incorporated into the interstices of a ceramic matrix of Al2O3. To<br>
produce such a layer by the CVD process, AlCI3, CO2 and H2 are admitted as a gas phase into<br>
a reaction vessel at 1100° C. to produce Al2O3 or ZrCl4 and water vapor (H2O) are admitted to<br>
produce ZrO2. Because of the density difference between the tetragonal modification of ZrO2<br>
formed at temperatures above the transformation temperature of about 1100° C. and the<br>
monoclinic modification formed below about 1100° C, with a corresponding phase<br>
conversion there can be a significant change in volume of the deposited ZrO2. As a<br>
consequence, with increasing volume proportions of the ZrO2 there is a simultaneous increase<br>
in the micro-crack density in the deposited ceramic layer.<br>
In DE 28 25 009 C2 (U.S. Pat. No. 4,180,400), a hard metal body with a thin wear-resistant<br>
surface layer of Al2O3 has been described and which is composed completely or at least 85%<br>
of the K-modification and any possible remainder of the a-modification, forming surface<br>
regions or patches at most 10 µm in size. The aluminum oxide layer can contain further<br>
additions of titanium, zirconium and/or hafnium. To create this ceramic layer by the CVD<br>
process, the gas mixture apart from AlC3. CO2, CO and H2 has also small amounts of 0.03 to<br>
0.5% TiCl4 added to it. This addition, however, serves exclusively or nearly exclusively for<br>
the formation of the K-Al2O3 phase.<br>
A further CVD process for depositing A12O3 and/or ZrO2 using additional reagents, like<br>
hydrogen sulfide, has been described in EP 0 523 021 B1 (U.S. Pat. No. 5,674,564).<br><br>
DE 195 18 927 Al (U.S. Pat. No. 5,827,570) describes a coated cutting tool comprised of a<br>
substrate of sintered carbide or ceramic with a wear-resistant composite ceramic coating<br>
which has two different metal oxide phases, for example of Al2O3 and ZrO2 and in addition<br>
thereto a doping agent selected from the group of sulfur, selenium, tellurium, phosphorus,<br>
arsenic, antimony, bismuth or compounds of these elements. To produce this two-phase layer<br>
by a CVD process, for example AlCl3 and ZrCl4. CO2 with H2 as a carrier gas, in addition to<br>
an H2S gas, is passed over the substrate body at a temperature of about 700° to 1250° C. and<br>
a pressure from 133 Pa to ambient pressure, whereby the two-phase layer with the doping<br>
agent is deposited.<br>
EP 0 786 536 Al (U.S. Pat. No. 5,985,427) describes a coated hard metal body with a 3 to 30<br>
µm thick aluminum oxide coating which has been deposited by means of CVD and/or PVD<br>
and contains 0.005 to 0.5 weight % chlorine. Optionally 0.5 to 10 weight % Zr and/or Hf and<br>
1.5 to 15 weight % Ti can be contained in this coating.<br>
EP 0 162 656 A2 (U.S. Pat. No. 4,746,563) describes a multilayer coating on a hard metal<br>
substrate body which is comprised of an inner layer, which is composed of at least one<br>
carbide, nitride, carbonitride, carbo-oxygen nitride, oxynitride, boron nitride or boron-<br>
carbonitride of titanium, and an outer multilayer coating with a total thickness of 5 to 20 µm<br>
and provided with an outer layer of a plurality of Al2O3 coatings with a respective thickness<br>
of 0.01 to 2 µm and each comprised of an Al2O3 film in which titanium oxide has been<br>
dissolved or which has been codeposited with at least 30 volume percent titanium oxide. The<br>
layers are separated by intervening layers with respective thicknesses of 0.01 to 2 urn and<br>
which each can comprise TiC, TiN, TiCN, TiCNO. TiNO, titanium oxides. Ti(B.N).<br>
Ti(B.N,C), SiC,AlN or A1ON.<br>
In WO 00/17 416 (U.S. Pat. No. 6,660,371), a composite material of a coated hard metal or<br>
cermet base body has been described on which the single layer or a multilayer coating is<br>
applied at least in the form of a 0.5 urn to 25 µm thick coating and preferably the outermost<br>
phase is an Al2O3 phase containing a ZrO2 and/or HfO2 phase which in turn contains a third<br>
fine dispersive phase consisting of an oxide, oxycarbide, oxynitride or oxycarbonitride of<br>
titanium. The proportion of the third phase in the overall composition of this layer amounts to<br>
0.2 to 5 mol %. To produce such a three phase layer, a CVD process with deposition<br>
temperatures between 900° C. and 1000° C. is selected in which the gases required for the<br><br>
deposit contain chlorides of the Al, Zr and I If, and in addition CO2, H2, CH4 and N2 or inert<br>
gas under pressures of 10 to 100,000 Pa. The TiOx incorporated as the third phase has a<br>
positive effect on the growth speed and on the particle sizes of the aluminum oxide and<br>
zirconium or hafnium oxide. Preferably a coating temperature of 960° C. is selected in which<br>
the ZrO2 is present in the monoclinic form. From the mentioned publication, therefore, hard<br>
metal substrate bodies are known which have layer sequences TiN—Ti(C,N) and the<br>
described three phase layer.<br>
OBJECT OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is the object of the present invention to provide a composite body which, when used as a<br>
cutting insert, affords increased cutting affectivity as well as a longer useful life. Higher<br>
cutting effectiveness is determined in terms of the desired high cutting speeds and increased<br>
thicknesses of the chip removed. If possible such cutting inserts should be usable in so-called<br>
dry cutting operations.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
These objects are attained with a composite material having a base body carrying at least one<br>
multiphase coating of the oxides of aluminum, zirconium and/or hafnium and of titanium (as<br>
a three phase coating) and a single-phase layer or coating of Al2O3, ZrO2 or HfO2- In the<br>
coating on the base body, therefore, there is. both at least one mutiphase oxide layer as well<br>
as at least one single-phase oxide layer. The multiphase layer can, apart from the three-<br>
mentioned oxide components, contain MgO and the single-phase layer can additionally<br>
contain up to 1% of a titanium oxide proportion. According to a further feature of the<br>
invention, however, at least two and preferably at least three layers are, provided of which<br>
each is comprised of the mentioned multiphase layer of the oxides of Al, Zr, Ti and/or Al, Hf,<br>
Ti and/or Al, Zr, Ti, Mg and/or Al, Hf, Ti, Mg, and a single-phase oxide layer of an oxide of<br>
Hf, Zr or Al. Preferably at least three-phase or four-phase oxide layers are provided between<br>
which respective single-phase oxide layers are disposed and whereby a single-phase oxide<br>
layer also forms the outer cover coating. These layers have a fine grained lattice structure and<br>
a uniform phase distribution and provide a high degree of thermal insulation. The base body<br>
can also be comprised of a hard metal, a cermet, or steel or a ceramic material.<br>
Between the substrate body and the first oxide layer which preferably is a multiphase oxide<br>
layer is at least one layer of a carbonitride of titanium, hafnium, zirconium. This cover layer<br>
can have a thickness between 2 to 15 µm, especially 3 to 8 mm.<br><br>
According to a further feature of the invention it is possible to provide, between the<br>
multiphase oxide layer and the single-phase oxide layer, preferably in a multilayer sequence<br>
of the multiphase oxide layers and single-phase oxide layers between each of the mentioned<br>
layers, one or more intermediate layers of titanium, hafnium or zirconium carbonitride.<br>
These intervening layers have preferably a thickness between 0.2 and 3 urn, especially of 2<br>
µm.<br>
The total thickness of all multiphase oxide layers and all single-phase oxide layers preferably<br>
lies between 6 and 20 urn especially at 10 urn. The difference of a single-phase oxide layer<br>
can amount to 2 to 6 urn preferably 4 urn and the thickness of an individual single-phase<br>
oxide layer can amount to 1 to 5 urn preferably 3 µm.<br>
The multiphase coating is produced by a CVD process which is basically known from WO<br>
00/17 416 or as the so-called middle temperature CVD process.<br>
In a further embodiment of the invention, to eliminate tensile stresses or to increase<br>
compressive stresses in the composite body, the composite body can be subjected to a<br>
treatment with a blasting agent, the blasting agent being preferably composed of a hard metal<br>
granulate which can have a substantially rounded grain configuration and a maximum grain<br>
diameter of 200 µm and more preferably of a maximum of 100 µm.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
FIGS. 1 to 3 show respective diagrams which provide information with respect to the<br>
improved life of the composite material according to the invention in cutting inserts by<br>
comparison with the state of the art.<br>
THIS INVENTION IS ILLUSTRATED IN THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
Further advantages of the invention are described in connection with an exemplary<br>
embodiment. The drawing shows.<br>
FIGS. 1 to 3 respective diagrams which provide information with respect to the improved life<br>
of the composite material according to the invention in cutting inserts by comparison with the<br>
state of the art.<br><br>
' The test objects were in all three cases cutting inserts of the type CNMG120412-5. In all<br>
three cases the substrate: body: was a hard metal (THM) but the coatings were different in the<br>
three cases. In a first test series the work press was gray cast iron with a cutting speed of 450<br>
m/min and a cutting depth of: 2. 5 mm and an advance of the cutting insert of 0.315 mm per<br>
revolution. The first cutting body was comprised of a hard metal base body coated with a two<br>
layer coating of TiCN—Al2O3 (as an outer layer). The life achieved was less than 2 min. A<br>
significantly improved life was given with a two layer coating in which on a TiCN— cover<br>
layer a three phase oxide layer according to WO 00/17 416 was applied comprised of<br>
Al2O3/ZrO2/TiOx.<br>
A clear improvement in the useful life still further can however be achieved with a cutting<br>
insert which had a TiCN adjacent the substrate body and a six layer outer coating which was<br>
comprised of three individual layers each of a three phase oxide coating and a single-phase<br>
ZrO2 layer.<br>
In a second test a gray cast iron workpiece with an extremely rough surface is machined by<br>
turning whereby in comparison to the previously described test only the cutting speed was<br>
reduced to 200 m/min. Based upon this cutting speed, there was obtained a useful life of 6<br>
min for the cutting inserts with a TiCN—Al2O3 coating, of about 7 min for cutting inserts<br>
with a TiCN—Al2O3/ZrO2/TiOx coating, and a useful life of 9 min for a cutting insert with<br>
the coating of the invention in which by contrast with the previously described versions had a<br>
three times alteration of a three-phase oxide layer of AlO2O3/HfO2/TiOx and the single-phase<br>
oxide layer of HfO2. The above described cutting tests were carried out with so-called dry<br>
cutting.<br>
As FIG. 3 shows, however, with use of a lubricant coolant, still higher useful lives can be<br>
obtained. In the lathe turning of is grey cast iron at cutting speeds of 450 m/min. a cutting<br>
depth of 2.5 mm, and a feed of 0.315 mm per revolution, the useful life of the cutting insert<br>
with a TiCN—Al2O3 cutting amounted to about 4.5, min. the useful life of a cutting insert<br>
with a coating according to WO 00/17 416 was about 6.5 min, whereas the coating according<br>
to the invention resulted in useful lives of 10 or 12.5 min. Especially when HfO2 forms the<br>
single-phase oxide layers, it is possible to obtain a still more substantial increase in the useful<br>
life by comparison with the already improved life using ZrO2 as the single-phase oxide layer.<br>
All coatings were applied by the so-called CVD-MT (middle temperature) process under the<br>
same process conditions.<br><br>
