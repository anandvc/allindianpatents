				<td>OPHTHALMIC LENSES WITH REDUCED CHROMATIC ABERRATION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to ophthalmic lenses. In particular, the<br>
invention is directed to spectacle lenses in which chromatic aberration is reduced.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
The use of ophthalmic lenses for the correction of ametropia is well known.<br>
In the manufacture of spectacle lenses, it is desirable to use high refractive index<br>
materials, or materials with a refractive index greater than 1.50, in order to provide<br>
acceptable edge and center thicknesses, especially in higher power lenses. However,<br>
increasing the refractive index using conventional materials such as polycarbonate<br>
or inorganic glass results in an increase in chromatic aberration or color dispersion.<br>
Longitudinal and transverse chromatic aberration is caused by the<br>
displacement of images formed by light of different wavelengths. The magnitude of<br>
the aberration depends on the power of the lens and the physical properties of the<br>
lens material. Persons wearing spectacle lenses made of conventional materials will<br>
experience chromatic aberration to varying degrees, especially in the periphery of<br>
their visual fields.<br>
For a refractive single element lens, typical for a spectacle lens, the lens'<br>
transverse chromatic aberration ("TCA") in diopters depends upon the Abbe<br>
number (V), the lens power(F) in diopters, and the gaze height on the lens from the<br>
lens center (y) in millimeters as shown in Equation I.<br>
The following table shows the TCA for various lens powers and Abbe values at a<br>
gaze height of 15 mm.<br><br>
The TCA becomes problematic to many wearers if it is greater than 0.25 diopters.<br>
Typical conventional high refractive index materials have Abbe numbers<br>
from 30 to 45, which will cause problems for some wearers. Some low refractive<br>
index materials that are considered low dispersion will have Abbe numbers greater<br>
than 55, which gives acceptable chromatic performance to the vast majority of<br>
wearers. However, high refractive index materials are desirable for spectacle lenses<br>
because they permit production of thinner and lighter weight lenses. Therefore, a<br>
need exists for a high refractive index material for spectacle lens use that can<br>
provide chromatic performance equivalent to low refractive index lenses with large<br>
Abbe numbers.<br><br>

Description of the Invention and its Preferred Embodiments<br>
The present invention provides single vision and multifocal lenses, as well as<br>
methods for their production, in which both diffractive and refractive elements are<br>
used. This composite lens reduces, by about 10 to 100 %, transverse chromatic<br>
aberration enabling provision of a high refractive index lens that has an effective<br>
Abbe number of about 50 to 120. By combining refractive and diffractive powers in<br>
a specified balance, a lens may be provided with performance equivalent to a<br>
refractive lens with a higher Abbe number.<br>
In one embodiment, the invention provides an ophthalmic lens comprising,<br>
consisting essentially of, and consisting of spherical power F, a diffractive element<br>
comprising a first spherical power Fd and a refractive element comprising a second<br>
spherical power Fr wherein F = FD + Fr. By "ophthalmic lens" is meant a lens<br>
suitable to correct visual acuity including, without limitation spectacle, contact,<br>
intraocular, onlay lenses and the like.<br>
For a single vision lens, F may be the average spherical power throughout<br>
the lens, the local spherical power at the optical center, or the local spherocylindrical<br>
power at the optical center. One ordinarily skilled in the art will recognize that the<br>
value of FD will depend upon the spherical power selected and the desired level of<br>
correction of TCA. For a multifocal lens, Fmay be the spherical or<br>
spherocylindrical power at the optical center or fitting, the power at the center of the<br>
near vision region of the lens, or the local power varying throughout the optic in<br>
which case Fd will vary throughout the lens.<br>
The diffractive element may be any suitable element including, without<br>
limitation, a diffractive grating, a hologram, a kinoform, and the like. The power<br>
provided by the diffractive element may be positive or negative power.<br>
The ideal TCA correction may be achieved by requiring that:<br><br>
wherein Vr is the Abbe number of the lens material and Vd is the effective Abbe<br>
number of the diffractive element of the lens. Typically, the lens material Abbe<br>
number will be about 30 to about 60.<br>
The Abbe number of the diflractive element may be defined as:<br><br>
where ?mid is the wavelength of the midpoint of the range of interest For visible<br>
systems a value of 587 nm is typically used. The short wavelength of the range of<br>
interest is ?Short and for visible systems a value of 486 nm is typically used. The<br>
long wavelength of the range of interest is ?long- For visible systems 656 nm is<br>
typically used. Using these wavelength values, Vd is -3.45.<br>
The diffractive power required for the lens may be obtained by solving<br>
Equation IV resulting in:<br><br>
Preferably, the diffractive element adds about 0.10 to about 1.50 diopters of<br>
spherical power.<br>
The diffractive element may cover substantially the entire, or a portion of,<br>
the back, or concave surface, front, or convex surface, or a surface intermediate the<br>
front or back surface of the lens. The diffractive element may be of any shape<br>
including, without limitation, annular, circular, elliptical, and the like. Preferably,<br>
the diffractive element covers the back surface for purposes of ease of manufacture<br>
and for cosmetic durability. In the embodiment in which the diffractive element is<br>
intermediate to the front and back surfaces, the change in refractive index across the<br>
intermediate layer must be such that it enables the diffractive element to function.<br>
Typically, the change in refractive index must be between 0 and 0.25 units per<br>
micron.<br>
Figure 1 is a graph depicting the preferred combination of refractive<br>
and diffractive spherical power for total lens powers of polycarbonate lenses of from<br>
-9.00 to +9.00 diopters assuming that Vr is 30. One of ordinary skill in the art will<br>
realize that for materials with a larger Vr, less diffractive power will be required. A<br>
reduction in chromatic aberration may be realized with diffractive powers meeting<br>
the following criteria:<br><br>
In this equation, Fd is defined as the optimum value of the diffractive power for a<br>
refractive power Fr and its value may be from about 0 to about 2Fd. If the value is<br>
0, there is no correction of chromatic aberration. If the value is 2Fd, then the<br>
chromatic aberration if equal to that of the lens but in the opposite direction.<br><br>
Figure 2 depicts the Fd using Equation II and plotted along the positive and<br>
negative tolerance limits as given by the Equation VII. If the diffractive power is<br>
within the limits provided by Equation VII, then the transverse chromatic aberration<br>
is reduced by at least 50 %. Although it may be desirable for optimum TCA<br>
correction to require the diffractive power to satisfy Equation II, the relaxed<br>
constraint provided by Equation VII allows the chromatic performance to be<br>
improved to be equivalent to or better than that provided for with low index, high<br>
Abbe number glasses without requiring a unique diffractive element for every<br>
spherical power.<br>
Equation V may be cast in an alternate form so that the diffractive power is<br>
defined in terms of the maximum allowable TCA. In this form, for low lens<br>
spherical powers that inherently have small amounts of transverse chromatic<br>
aberration, the solution allows for only refractive power. In this form, the constraint<br>
on the diffractive power is:<br><br>
The lenses of the invention may be fabricated by any convenient means and<br>
constructed of any known material suitable for production of ophthalmic lenses.<br>
Suitable materials include, without limitation, polycarbonate, allyl diglycol,<br>
polymethacrylate, and the like. Such materials are either commercially available or<br>
methods for their production are known. Further, the lenses may be produced by<br>
any conventional lens fabrication technique including, without limitation grinding,<br>
whole lens casting, molding, thermoforming, laminating, surface casting, or<br>
combinations thereof. Casting may be carried out by any means, but preferably is<br>
performed by surface casting including, without limitation, as disclosed in United<br>
States Patent Nos. 5,147,585, 5,178,800, 5,219,497, 5,316,702, 5,358,672,<br>
5,480,600, 5,512,371, 5,531,940, 5,702,819, and 5,793,465 incorporated herein in<br>
their entireties by reference.<br>
The diffractive element may be provided through a molding process using<br>
optical tools incorporating the required diffiactive elements. Such tools include,<br>
without limitation, metal inserts suitable for injection or compression molding of<br>
plastic optical parts, glass or metal molds for casting of optical parts, snd metal or<br>
ceramic stamping tools. Alternatively, the diffractive element may be provided by<br>
diamond turning. The finished element may be coated with a suitable coating that<br>
conforms to the element and preserves the function of the diffractive element.<br>
Alternatively, a non-conforming coating may be used to effectively bury the<br>
diffractive element under the coating. In this embodiment, the width and depth of<br>
the individual grating elements will have to take into account the difference on<br>
refractive index between the coating and the substrate. Suitable coatings are<br>
commercially available or methods for their making are known.<br>
Because the magnitude of the diffractive power is dependent on the total<br>
spherical power of the lens, computation of the diffractive power for each lens is<br>
dependent on the prescription for the individual who use the lens. Thus, the<br>
diffractive element is provided on a made-to-order basis. In one method for<br>
providing such made-to-order elements, an individual's corrective prescription is<br>
determined and a semi-finished blank with the suitable front surface geometry is<br>
selected. The front surface of the semi-finished blank may be provided with any<br>
suitable coating as, for example, a hard coating, antireflective coating, tinted<br>
coating, or the like. Subsequently, the blank is attached to a rotationally<br>
symmetrical holding fixture on the front surface so that the fixture is aligned with an<br>
optical reference point, such as the optical center. The blocked blank may then be<br>
machined on a multi-axis, computer numerically controlled diamond turning<br>
machine to form the desired surface, for example sphere, tone, progressive addition,<br>
on the back surface that includes the diffractive element. Preferably, machining is<br>
carried out by a single point diamond tool mounted on a computer controlled, two<br>
axis, linear drive. The surface to be machined may be described by any convenient<br>
method including, without limitation, by describing the surface in terms of x, y, and<br>
z coordinates or by a set of polynomials each with a set of coefficients and boundary<br>
conditions. The machined surface may subsequently be coated with any desired<br>
coating.<br>
Although the invention may find particular utility in the design of spectacle<br>
lenses, the refractive and diffractive elements may be applied to any type of lens for<br>
correction of visual acuity such as a spectacle lens, a contact lens, or an intraocular<br>
lens, and the like. The invention will be clarified further by a consideration of the<br>
following, non-limiting examples.<br>
Examples<br>
Example 1<br>
A single vision lens with -4.00 diopters of spherical power is made from<br>
polycarbonate with an Abbe number of 29. As a baseline for comparison purposes,<br>
a conventional refractive lens is first analyzed, which lens has a front radius of 200<br>
mm and back radius of 79 mm. The lens is analyzed by computing the RMS spot<br>
size at the focal plane of an 18 mm focal length lens placed at the eye rotation point<br>
27 mm from the lens. The RMS spot size is computed for input angles from -40 to<br>
+40 degrees and is shown in Figure 3.<br>
A diffractive element with a power, of-0.37 diopters is placed on the back,<br>
concave, surface of the lens. To maintain the spherical power, the radius of the back<br>
surface is changed to 89 mm. The RMS spot size for this difiractive/refractive lens<br>
is shown in graphical form in Fig. 4. The image quality at x = 0, y = 0 improved as<br>
measured by the decrease in spot size from approximately 0.004 mm to<br>
0.001 mm. This is due primarily to an improvement in the axial, or longitudinal,<br>
aberration. The improvement in image quality is more pronounced for off-axis<br>
angles of incidence. For example, at x = 0, y = -20 degrees the RMS spot size is<br>
0.017 mm for the conventional refractive lens, but 0.003 mm for the lens with the<br>
diffractive element.<br>
Example 2<br>
A polycarbonate, non-toric, progressive addition lens is provided with a<br>
distance power of-4.00 diopters and an add power of 1.30 diopters. In Figure 5 is<br>
depicted the RMS spot size for the lens. In Fig. 4 is depicted the unwanted<br>
astigmatism in the lens. In both of these figures is shown cross-sectional analysis<br>
through horizontal cuts through the lens at various angles. The 10-degree cross-<br>
section is a horizontal cut through the far vision region of the lens. In this particular<br>
lens, the near vision region is at —40 degrees. A series of cuts is made from the far<br>
vision region through the intermediate vision region and to the near vision region.<br>
A diffractive grating with a -0.35 diopters of power is added on the concave<br>
surface of the lens. The overall sphere power remains -4.00 diopters, but the<br>
refractive portion of the sphere power was reduced to -3.65 diopters. The Abbe<br>
number of the diffractive portion of the lens was approximately-3.5 and that of the<br>
refractive portion 29. As shown in Fig. 6, the image quality improved most<br>
dramatically along the central meridian, or center of the channel, of the lens. The<br>
improvement is obtained without any increase in unwanted astigmatism in the lens<br>
as illustrated in Fig. 8.<br>
Example 3<br>
The diffractive power for a family of designs can be chosen so that a unique<br>
diffractive is not required for each sphere power. The total spherical power for a<br>
lens is the sum of the refractive power of the front surface plus the refractive power<br>
of the back surface plus the diffiractive power of the diffractive element, whether it is<br>
applied to the front, back, or to an intermediate surface.<br>
Table 2 shows the front refractive, back refractive, and diffractive powers for<br>
a family of designs for single vision lenses made from polycarbonate that will<br>
provide improved chromatic performance because of the diffractive power provided<br>
on five of six unique front curves (9, 8,6,4,2, and 1 Diopters). For each sphere<br>
power there is a unique back curve. The transverse chromatic aberration at a height<br>
of 15 mm on the lens is also shown. The diffractive power was chosen for each of<br>
the six unique front curves to give the minimum TCA over the range of sphere<br>
powers covered by that case. For the case with a 4 diopter front surface refractive<br>
power, the diffractive power chosen was 0 diopters because this still satisfied the<br>
constraint given by Equation VII.<br>
