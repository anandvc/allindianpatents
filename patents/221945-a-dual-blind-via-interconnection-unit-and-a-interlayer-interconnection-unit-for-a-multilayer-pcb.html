"TELESCOPING   BLIND VIA   IN THREE-LAYER CORE"<br>
QUALCOMM INCORPORATED of 5775 Morehouse Drive, San Diego, California   92121-1714, USA.<br><br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br>
wo 2005/036940		PCT/US2004/033012<br>
TELESCOPING BLIND VIA IN THREE-LAYER CORE<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0001]	The present invention generally relates to printed circuit boards, and<br>
more particularly to multilayer printed circuit boards comprising a three-layer core<br>
having a dual blind via interlayer interconnection unit.   The present invention also<br>
relates to methods for forming a three-layer core of a multilayer printed circuit board.<br>
[0002]	The present trend in the design and manufacture of printed circuit boards<br>
(PCBs)   is   towards   decreased   size,   smaller  hole  or  via   diameter,   and   higher<br>
interconnection density. High interconnection densities require multilayer PCBs having<br>
more than one signal layer with numerous interconnections therebetween.<br>
[0003]	Each signal layer of prior art multilayer PCBs typically consists of a<br>
patterned conductive metal layer. Adjacent conductive layers are separated by an insulating material or dielectric layer comprising, for example, a polyimide or a resin which may be reinforced with glass fiber. Interconnections between the various conductive layers are provided by holes or vias that extend through the intervening dielectric layer, wherein the vias or holes are plated, filled, and/or plated over with conductive material. Such vias or holes may be through holes, blind vias, or buried vias. Through holes extend to all conductive layers of a multilayer assembly. In contrast, blind vias and buried vias pass through only part of a PCB - blind vias having one end of the via exposed, and buried vias having neither end of the via exposed. Thus, a blind via connects two or more layers of a PCB and starts on an outer layer, but does not pass completely through the PCB. A buried via connects two or more inner layers of a PCB but no outer layer.<br>
[0004]	Two-layer cores, which consist of a thin dielectric layer covered with<br>
copper foil, form the basic building block of prior art PCBs. Typically, the dielectric layer of a two-layer core is covered with copper foil on both sides. Multilayer PCBs of the prior art may be formed by laminating two or more two-layer cores After patterning the copper foil of the signal layers, the layers are laminated using heat and pressure. Plated via holes for interlayer connection may be formed by drilling in the z-axis between layers, e.g., by laser drilling, followed by plating the hole. A blind via may be formed by drilling partly through one or more dielectric layers, followed by<br><br>
WO 2IMt5/03fcV40<br><br>
3<br><br>
PCT/US2004/033012 <br>
plating the hole., or by forming a plated through hole and then laminating an additional<br>
layer on one side thereof. A buried via may be formed by forming a blind via and<br>
laminating an additional layer on the exposed end of the blind via, or by providing a<br>
plated through hole and laminating an additional layer on each side of the plated<br>
through hole. Such procedures or processes are well known in the art.<br>
[0005]	As noted above, the standard building block of prior art PCBs is a core<br>
consisting of a two-layer dielectric carrier. Stacking a fivia on either side of such a<br>
carrier requires a solid target pad for laser ablating down to (or building up from with<br>
additive technology) the top of the carrier's buried via. This requires creating either a<br>
solid copper through via, or a via that is filled and plated over in the carrier. Creation of<br>
such vias becomes problematic as via size and dielectric thickness decrease, hi order to<br>
form a large enough via in the carrier to drill and fill effectively, the minimum<br>
producible drill-to-adjacent-feature spacing cannot be maintained. Likewise, filling a<br>
through via on a thin carrier has limited producibility due to limitations of via fill and<br>
plating processes related to decreased carrier thickness. Also, restrictions on high<br>
aspect ratio of the filled hole effectively limit the thickness of the carrier's dielectric<br>
layer. However, in certain situations a thicker dielectric layer might be required, e.g.?<br>
for impedance purposes, or for overall finished dimensions of the PCB. Furthermore,<br>
thin dielectric layers, which may be required to maintain a minimum aspect ratio for<br>
/ivias formed therein, may lack the necessary dimensional stability for processing, e.g.,<br>
filling a plated hole, which may result in destruction of the carrier.<br>
[0006]	In addition, filling a via of the prior art usually requires multiple plating<br>
cycles, and consequently may result in unacceptably thick total surface copper for etching fine features on a signal layer. Consequently, a significant portion of the total surface copper may have to be removed by mechanical means during processing according to the prior art.<br>
[0007]	Figure 1A is a cross-sectional view of a copper clad dielectric layer 10<br>
for processing into a conventional two-layer carrier for a PCB, according to the prior<br>
art. Copper clad dielectric layer 10 includes a first copper layer 20, a second copper<br>
layer 22, and a dielectric layer 24 disposed between first and second copper layers 20,<br>
22. Dielectric layer 24 may comprise a dielectric material, such as a glass fiber<br>
reinforced resin, or a polyimide, and the like.<br>
[0008]	Figure IB is a cross-sectional view of a conventional carrier 10' for a<br><br>

PCT/US2004/033012 <br>
PCB in the form of a two-layer core, according to the prior art. Carrier '10' has two metal layers, namely a first copper layer 20 and a second copper layer 22, is well as a dielectric layer 24 disposed between first and second copper layers 20, 22. Carrier 10 includes a plated through hole 40 which has been filled and plated over. Plated through hole 40 extends from a first pad 30 within first copper layer 20 to a second pad 32 within second copper layer 22. Plated through hole 40 serves as a conducting interconnection between first and second copper layers 20, 22. Such plated through holes are well known in the art. Regions of the prior art two-layer core that lack first and second copper layers 20, 22, e.g., due to etching thereof, are represented by reference numeral 26.<br>
[0009]	Figure 1C is a cross-sectional view of a conventional carrier 10" for a<br>
PCB in the form of a two-layer core, also according to the prior art. Carrier 10" includes a dielectric layer 24 disposed between first and second copper layers 20, 22, essentially as described for Figure IB. Figure 1C shows a blind via 40' which has been filled and plated over. Blind via 40' extends from a first pad 30 within first copper layer 20 to a second pad 32 within second copper layer 22. Blind via 40' serves as a conducting interconnection between different layers of a multilayer PCB. e.g., between first and second copper layers 20, 22. Such blind vias are well known in the art. Regions of prior art carrier 10" that lack first and second copper layers 20, 22, e.g., due to etching thereof, are represented by reference numeral 26.<br>
[0010]	As noted hereinabove, conventional two-layer cores of the prior art have<br>
a number of drawbacks and disadvantages. As an example, as hole size (e.g., via diameter) diminishes to accommodate higher interconnect densities, dielectric thickness must also decrease in order to maintain a certain minimum aspect ratio for the hole, since holes having aspect ratios below the producible minimum cannot be filled efficiently or reliably. Restrictions on dielectric thickness, in turn, are associated with a number of other disadvantages. However, dielectrics below a certain thickness cannot be processed reliably, leading to destruction of many incipient cores and poor processing efficiency. For example, increased dielectric thickness may be required for impedance purposes. Furthermore, a PCB having a relatively large overall dielectric thickness may offer advantages for providing connections thereto. In addition, increased overall dielectric thickness may allow for production of a PCB having a greater overall finished thickness, for example, to fit within a particular housing of an<br><br>
WO 2005/036940<br><br>
t?<br><br>
PCT/US2004/033012<br><br>
instrument, device, or appliance.<br>
[0011]	As can be seen, there is a need for a multilayer PCB having tin mterlayer<br>
interconnection unit, the formation of which requires only a single plating cycle. The use of only a single plating cycle can result in decreased thickness of total surface copper, thereby facilitating formation of fine features without the need for mechanical reduction of the surface copper layer. There is also a need for a dual via interlayer interconnection unit for a multilayer PCB, wherein the interconnection unit allows an overall increased aspect ratio, as compared with prior art plated through holes and vias. There is a further need for a PCB core or subassembly wherein the total thickness of the dielectric, at minimum hole and pad diameter, can be increased when greater dielectric thickness is required, for example, for impedance purposes or for overall finished thickness.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0039]	The following detailed description is of the best currently contemplated<br>
modes of carrying out the invention.   The description is not to be taken in a limiting<br>
sense, but is made merely for the purpose of illustrating the general principles of the<br>
invention, since the scope of the invention is best defined by the appended claims.<br>
[0040]	Generally, the present invention provides a carrier for a multilayer<br>
printed circuit board (PCB) or printed wiring board, wherein the carrier may include a novel interlayer interconnection unit for interconnecting a plurality of conductive layers of the multilayer PCB. A basic carrier, sub-assembly, or building block according to one embodiment of the invention may comprise a pseudo three-layer core. Each pseudo three-layer core may comprise two signal layers for a multilayer PCB, wherein the two signal layers are interconnected through an interconnection unit comprising an internal bridge layer disposed between the two signal layers.<br>
[0041]	A pseudo three-layer core of the present invention may have additional<br>
layers added thereto. For example, a multilayer PCB of the invention may comprise a<br>
single pseudo three-layer core, and up to six (6) or more conductive layers. A plurality<br>
of carriers may be combined, e.g., laminated together, to form a multilayer PCB having<br>
up to about 28 or more signal layers. Multilayer PCBs find almost universal<br>
applications in electrical or electronic devices, instruments, and appliances.<br>
[0042]	In contrast to a conventional two-layer core of the prior art, for example,<br>
as described hereinabove with reference to Figures IB-C, in one embodiment the present invention provides a carrier having two dielectric layers, a bridge layer disposed between the two dielectric layers, and a pair of external conductive layers. As compared with carriers of the present invention, prior art carriers, i.e., two-layer cores of prior art multilayer PCBs, have only a single dielectric layer and lack a bridge layer. As compared with prior art multilayer PCBs which have a carrier comprising a two-layer core in which a single dielectric layer is disposed between two conductive layers,<br><br>
WO 2005/036940	//	PCT/US2004/033012<br>
multilayer PCBs of the present invention have a carrier comprising a three-layer core, or pseudo three-layer core, including a pseudo metal layer or bridge layer disposed between two dielectric layers.<br>
[0043]	The bridge layer of carriers of the present invention may be referred to as<br>
a pseudo metal layer in that the bridge layer is not a metal layer of the type encountered<br>
in prior art carriers, for example, due to the lack of electrical connectivity within the<br>
bridge layer between the metal bridge pads that constitute the bridge layer. Due to the<br>
presence of the internal pseudo metal (bridge) layer in carriers of the present invention,<br>
the basic carrier of the invention, which may comprise the bridge layer, the two<br>
dielectric layers, and the pair of external conductive layers, may be referred to as a<br>
pseudo three-layer core. The pair of outer conductive layers may be interconnected by a<br>

interconnection units within a portion of a pseudo three-layer core 110, according to an embodiment of the present invention. Pseudo three-layer core 110 may include a first interlayer interconnection unit 150a, and an nth interlayer interconnection unit 15On. Pseudo three-layer core 110 may include a first metal layer 120, a first dielectric layer 124 disposed on first metal layer 120, a bridge layer 126 disposed on first dielectric layer 124, a second dielectric layer 125 disposed on bridge layer 126, and a second metal layer 122 disposed on second dielectric layer 125. Each of interlayer interconnection units 150a and 150n extend from first metal layer 120, through bridge layer 126, to second metal layer 122. For the purpose of clarity, only two interconnection units 150a, 150n are shown in Figure 3. In practice, pseudo three-layer core 110 may include any number of interlayer interconnection units. Typically, interlayer interconnection units 150a, 150n may be present only at locations, with respect to the x and y dimensions of a PCB, at which it is desired to interconnect first metal layer 120 to second metal layer 122. Locations at which interlayer interconnection units 150a, 150n may be present correspond to the locations of bridge pads 134. Such locations of bridge pads 134 are schematically represented in Figure 5. The x and y dimensions are shown in Figure 5 by the arrows labeled "x" and "y" respectively. Interlayer interconnection units of the present invention are further described hereinbelow, e.g., with reference to Figures 4A-B.<br>

layer core 110, with interlayer interconnection unit 150 shown in perspective view, according to one embodiment of the present invention.

bridge pads 134. Each bridge pad 134 may comprise an essentially disc-shaped conductive element, e.g., a copper disc. Each bridge pad 134 may lack electrical connection to other bridge pads 134 within bridge layer 126. Interlayer interconnection unit 150 may include one bridge pad 134 located within bridge layer 126 (Figure 5).<br><br>

That is to say, each bridge pad 134 may be a component of an interlayer interconnection unit 150.<br>
[0049]	Interlayer interconnection unit 150 may further include a first capture<br>
pad 130 within first metal layer 120, and a second capture pad 132 within second metal layer 122. First capture pad 130 and second capture pad 132 may each comprise a conductive (e.g., copper) element, which may be formed by the selective removal, e.g., by etching, of first metal layer 120 and second metal layer 122, respectively. It is apparent from Figure 4A that bridge pad 134 may have a diameter, Db that is greater than a diameter, Dc of first and second capture pads 130, 132. First Interlayer interconnection unit 150 may still further include a first blind via 140 and a second blind via 142. Each of first blind via 140 and second blind via 142 may be formed by a process such as laser drilling, plasma drilling, or photo-definition (photo-defining). Although Figure 4A shows a gap 112 within bridge layer 126 on either side of bridge pad 134, during lamination first and second dielectric layers 124, 125 may fuse together such that bridge pad 134 may be encapsulated within first and second dielectric layers 124,125.<br>
[0050]	During formation of interlayer interconnection unit 150, a first annular<br>
ring 131 may be formed within first metal layer 120. As an example, first annular ring 131 may comprise an annular, outer portion of first capture pad 130. Similarly, during formation of interlayer interconnection unit 150, a second annular ring 133 may be defined within second metal layer 122. As an example, second annular ring 133 may comprise an annular, outer portion of second capture pad 132. Each of first annular ring 131 and second annular ring 133 may comprise an annular conductive (e.g., copper) element.<br>

second blind vias 140, 142 may be plated shut, hi some embodiments, first and second blind vias 140,142 may be plated shut using a jufill process, such as the MicroFill™ VF process of the Shipley Company, LLC (Marlborough, MA). Briefly, MicroFill™ VF is a direct current electrolytic copper plating process for filling blind vias, including //vias.

[0052]	Figure 4B is a side view of the interlayer interconnection unit of Figure<br>
4A, according to the present invention. First and second dielectric layers 124. 125 are<br>
omitted from Figure 4B for the sake of clarity. As may be seen in Figures 4A-B, bridge<br>
pad 134 may include a first side 134a and a second side 134b. First blind via 140 may<br>
include a first via inner end 140a and a first via outer end 140b. Inner end 140a may be<br>
in electrical contact with bridge pad first side 134a, while outer end 140b may be in<br>
electrical contact with first capture pad 130 and encircled by first annular ring 131.<br>
Second blind via 142 may include a second via inner end 142a and a second via outer<br>
end 142b. Inner end 142a may be in electrical contact with bridge pad second side<br>
134b, while outer end 142b may be in electrical contact with second capture pad 132<br>
and encircled by second annular ring 133. First and second annular rings 131, 133, may<br>
be considered to be the remaining annular portion of first and second capture pads 130,<br>
132, respectively, after formation of a hole therethrough. Thus, interlayer<br>
interconnection unit 150 may extend from first capture pad 130, through first blind via<br>
140, bridge pad 134, second blind via 142, and thence to second capture pad 132.<br>
[0053]	Again with reference to Figures 4A-B, each of first and second blind vias<br>
140,142, respectively, may have an aspect ratio of about 1:1, and usually at least about 1:1. Because first and second blind vias 140, 142 are aligned in the z dimension, or coaxial with each other, interlayer interconnection unit 150 may have an effective aspect ratio of about 2:1, and often greater than 2:1. Thus, interlayer interconnection unit 150 of the instant invention allows for a greater than two fold (2X) increase in effective aspect ratio for interconnecting adjacent conductive layers of multilayer PCBs, as compared with the prior art. At the same time, because pseudo three-layer core 110 of the instant invention has two dielectric layers and two signal layers (as compared with only one dielectric layer in prior art two-layer cores) the total dielectric thickness (i.e., the combined thickness of first and second dielectric layers 124, 125) per signal layer (e.g., the mean thickness of first metal layer 120 and second metal layer 122) may be increased by about two fold in carriers of the present invention as compared with a prior art two-layer core. This increase in total dielectric thickness per signal layer is achieved without increasing the aspect ratio of each blind via, i.e., of first and second blind vias 140,142. The effective aspect ratio of interlayer interconnection unit 150, as referred to herein, is the ratio of the length, L (Figure 4B) (i.e., the z dimension) of interlayer<br><br>

[0054]	Figure 5 is a plan view of a portion of a bridge layer 126 of a carrier for a<br>
multilayer PCB of the present invention. Bridge layer 126 may include a plurality of<br>
interstitial bridge pads 134. Each interstitial bridge pad 134- may comprise a metal, such<br>
as copper. The plurality of interstitial bridge pads 134 may be conveniently formed by<br>
etching one side of a copper clad dielectric layer 124 (e.g., Figures 11A-B).<br>
[0055]	Interstitial bridge pads 134 may be spaced apart from each other by a<br>
distance, S in the range of from about 0.7 to 4 mils, with a center-to-center pitch, P in<br>
the range of from about 15 to 25 mils. Each interstitial bridge pad 134 may have a<br>
diameter, d in the range of from about 12 to 20 mils, usually in the range of from about<br>
14 to 17 mils, and often in the range of from about 15 to 16 mils. Interstitial bridge<br>
pads 134 typically lack electrical connectivity, within bridge layer 126, to other bridge<br>
pads 134, or to any other conductive element (e.g., a trace or a component) of bridge<br>
layer 126. That is to say, bridge layer 126 may consist of a plurality of spaced apart<br>
bridge pads 134, with no electrical connections therebetween within bridge layer 126.<br>
[0056]	Figure 6 schematically represents a carrier 110' for a multilayer PCB,<br>
according to one embodiment of the present invention. Carrier 110' may include a pseudo three-layer core 110. As shown, carrier 110' may further include a first additional dielectric layer 124' and a first additional conductive layer 120' laminated thereto. Carrier 110' may still further include a second additional dielectric layer 125' and a second additional conductive layer 122' laminated thereto. In other embodiments of the invention (not shown in Figure 6), carrier 110' may have fewer or more additional dielectric and conductive layers than those shown in Figure 6 laminated to pseudo three-layer core 110.<br>
[0057]	As described hereinabove, pseudo three-layer core   110 may itself<br>
comprise two signal layers 120, 122. By adding additional conductive layers, e.g., layers 120', 122' to pseudo three-layer core 110, each carrier 110' may comprise from three to six or more conductive layers (only four conductive layers 120, 122, 120', and 122' are shown in Figure 6). Each of layers 120, 122, 120', and 122', or of any other additional conductive layers (not shown in Figure 6) of a carrier or multilayer PCB 100 may comprise a signal layer; or one or more conductive layers (e.g., layers 120, 122, 120', and 122', or other additional conductive layers) of a carrier or multilayer PCB 100<br><br>

may comprise a plane or ground layer, as is well known in the arl. Two or more carriers 110' may be combined (laminated) together (Figure 2) to form a multilayer PCB having from four to 28 or more conductive layers (see, e.g., Figure 6).<br>
[0058]	Figure 7 schematically represents a series of steps (202-214) involved in<br>
a method 200 for making a conventional carrier for a multilayer PCB, according to the prior art. Step 202 involves providing a metal clad dielectric layer, such as a layer of dielectric material having a layer of copper foil on each side. Due to production limitations associated with filling /xvias of a defined diameter and aspect ratio in a thin dielectric layer, the minimum thickness of the dielectric layer in prior art PCBs is typically about 4 mils.<br>
[0059]	Step 204 involves forming pads (capture pads and target pads) on the<br>
copper layers by etching the copper foil. The formation of such pads is well known in the art. Due to the industry trend towards high-density interconnections, the diameter of current state of the art capture pads and target pads is typically limited to around 10 mils. In prior art processing, there may be difficulties in aligning the drill to pads of this size. In comparison, bridge pads 134 of the invention may have diameters, d up to about 20 mils or more. The larger diameter, d f bridge pads 134 of the invention is possible because the pseudo metal layer (or bridge layer) 126 of carriers of the invention may lack traces, components, or other conductive features. The larger diameter of bridge pads 134 of the invention offer the advantage of facilitating drill registration during via formation.<br>
[0060]	Step 206 involves drilling a hole though one or both of the copper layers<br>
and the dielectric layer, to form a blind via or a through hole. Step 208 involves plating the hole. Thereafter, step 208, which entails a first plating cycle of the prior art process, adds to the overall thickness of the surface copper. Step 210 involves filling the hole with electrically conductive material, such as a high solids epoxy. Filling the hole in this manner becomes impracticable for presently used dielectric thickness, hole diameter, and aspect ratio. Step 212 involves plating over the fill, in a second plating cycle, to provide a contiguous metal layer over the filled hole. Thus, step 212 further adds to the surface copper thickness.<br>
[0061]	Excessive thickness of surface copper may prevent etching of fine<br>
features. For example, for a PCB having a 3 mil line and space specification, a surface copper thickness of 1.4 mils or less may be required.   Prior art processes that result in<br><br>
WO 2005/036940	/ "^	PCT/US2004/033012<br>
surface copper thickness greater than 1.4 mils may require additional processing steps to remove excess surface copper.<br>
[0062]	Step 214 of the prior art process involves planarizing the copper layer(s)<br>
in which holes have been drilled, plated, filled, and plated over. Planarizing may be accomplished by mechanical reduction of surface copper, which process may excessively stress the carrier. In situations, where surface copper exceeds the maximum permissible thickness, reduction of surface copper may damage or destroy the carrier or its components, leading to decreased manufacturing efficiency.<br>
[0063]	In contrast to the prior art, processes of the invention for making a<br>
multilayer PCB may use only one plating cycle. As a result, a total surface copper thickness of about 1 mil or less can be readily achieved. Lower total surface copper thickness decreases the amount of planarizing and mechanical reduction of surface copper, and allows finer line and space resolution.<br>
[0064]	Figure 8 schematically represents a series of steps (302-318) which may<br>
be involved in a method 300 for making a multilayer PCB, according to one embodiment of the present invention. Step 302 may involve pnyviding a metal clad first dielectric layer, such as a dielectric layer having a first side and a second side, and a layer of copper foil on both the first side and the second side. Step 304 may involve forming a bridge layer on one side of the dielectric layer. The bridge layer may comprise a plurality of spaced apart bridge pads, as described, herein (Figures 4A-B, Figure 5). The bridge layer may be formed by etching the copper foil on one side of the dielectric layer. Alternatively, the bridge pads and the bridge layer may be formed by building up from an exposed dielectric layer using an additive technology. The bridge layer formed during step 302 may be referred to as a pseudo metal layer.<br>
[0065]	Step 306 may involve providing a second dielectric layer disposed on the<br>
bridge layer. Step 308 may involve providing a second metal layer laminated to the second dielectric layer. Steps 306 and 308 may be combined into a single process in which a dielectric layer, which has been clad with the second metal layer, may be disposed on the bridge layer.<br>
[0066]	Step 310 may involve forming a first blind via, wherein the first blind via<br>
extends from the first metal layer, through tire first dielectric layer, and to a first side of a bridge pad within the bridge layer. Step 312 may involve forming a second blind via<br><br>
wo 2005/036940	l(?	PCT/US2004/033012<br>
from the second metal layer, through the second dielectric layer, and to a second side of the bridge pad within the bridge layer. Each of the first blind via and the second blind via 142 may be formed by a process such as laser drilling, plasma drilling, or photo-defining. Typically, the first blind via may emanate from a first capture pad of the first metal layer, and the second blind via may emanate from a second capture pad of the second metal layer. The first and second capture pads may be formed by etching the first and second metal layers, respectively.<br>
[0067]	Step 314 may involve plating shut the first and second blind vias, such<br>
that an interlayer interconnection unit may be formed within a multilayer carrier, wherein the interlayer interconnection unit may include a bridge pad disposed between the first and second blind vias (Figure 4A). The first and second blind vias may be opposed to each other in the z dimension and coaxial with the bridge pad. The first and second blind vias may be plated shut in a single plating cycle using a /xfill process, such as the MicroFill™ VF process of the Shipley Company, LLC (Marlborough, MA), as referred to hereinabove.<br>
[0068]	Optional step 316 may involve laminating one or more additional<br>
dielectric layers, and one or more additional metal layers, to the first and second metal<br>
layers of the basic carrier or pseudo three-layer core formed by steps 302-314. In this<br>
way, a carrier having up to six or more signal layers may be formed. Optional step 318<br>
can involve laminating together two or more carriers formed by steps 302-314, or by<br>
steps 302-316, to provide a multilayer PCB having from 4 to 28 or more signal layers.<br>
[0069]	Figure 9 schematically represents a series of steps (402-404) involved in<br>
a method 400 for making a multilayer PCB, according to another embodiment of the present invention. Step 402 may involve forming a multilayer carrier or a pseudo three-layer core. A pseudo three-layer core formed according to step 402 may include two signal layers. In some embodiments, the multilayer carrier or pseudo three-layer core may be considered to be a sub-assembly for the multilayer PCB. For example, additional signal layers may be laminated to the pseudo three-layer core; or two or more pseudo three-layer cores may be laminated together to form a multilayer PCB having at least 4 signal layers. Step 404 may involve forming a plurality of interlayer interconnection units within the carrier for interconnecting two or more conductive layers of the carrier. Interlayer interconnection units of the invention were described hereinabove  (e.g.,   with  reference  to  Figures   4A-B).      Formation   of interlayer<br><br>

[0070]	Figure 10 schematically represents a series of steps (502-514) involved<br>
in a method 500 for making a carrier for a multilayer PCB, according to another<br>
embodiment of the present invention, wherein step 502 may involve providing a first<br>
metal layer.   Step 504 may involve providing a first dielectric layer.   The first metal<br>
layer may be laminated to a first side of the first dielectric layer.<br>
[0071]	Step 506 may involve forming a bridge layer. Bridge layer, which may<br>
comprise a plurality of spaced apart bridge pads, may be formed by etching a layer of<br>
copper foil laminated to a second side of the first dielectric layer.   Formation of the<br>
bridge layer is described elsewhere herein, for example, with reference to method 200<br>
(Figure 7).<br>
[0072]	Step 508 may involve providing a second dielectric layer.   The second<br>
dielectric layer provided in step 508 may be laminated to the bridge layer, such that the<br>
bridge pads of bridge layer are encapsulated in dielectric material between the first and<br>
second dielectric layers. Step 510 may involve providing a second metal layer, which<br>
may be laminated to the second dielectric layer.<br>
[0073]	Step 512 may involve forming a first blind   via of an  interlayer<br>
interconnection unit, wherein the first blind via may be disposed between the first metal<br>
layer and a first side of a bridge pad. Step 514 may involve forming a second blind via<br>
of the interlayer interconnection unit, wherein the second blind via may be disposed<br>
between the second metal layer and a second side of the bridge pad.  First and second<br>
blind vias formed on opposite sides of a bridge pad within a multilayer carrier are<br>
described hereinabove, e.g., with reference to Figures 4A-B and Figure 7.<br>
[0074]	In method 500, first and second blind vias may be plated shut in a single<br>
plating cycle, for example, as described with reference to method 200 (Figure 7).  Use<br>
of a single plating cycle minimizes excessive build-up of surface copper, and therefore<br>
decreases   the  need   for  subsequent  reduction   of surface   copper,   as   described<br>
hereinabove. Optionally, after forming and plating shut the first and second blind vias<br>
to form a pseudo three-layer core, one or more additional dielectric layers and metal<br>
layers may be laminated to the pseudo three-layer core (see, e.g., step 316 of method<br>
300 (Figure 8)).<br>

[0077]	Figure 11C shows the structure of Figure 11B and which may have a<br>
