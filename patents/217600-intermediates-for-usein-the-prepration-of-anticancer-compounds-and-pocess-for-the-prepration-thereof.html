Detailed Description of the Invention Scheme 1 )H<br>
(Scheme Removed)<br><br>
Scheme 2<br>
                                                                                                                (Scheme Removed)<br><br>
The methods of the present invention may be described through reference to Schemes 1 to 3 above. In the reactions described below, all reactions are conducted at atmospheric pressure and room temperature (about 20-25°C) unless other conditions are specified. Further, unless otherwise noted, substituents R'-R10, R15 G and G1 are as described above.<br>
In Scheme 1, compounds of formula 1 may be prepared by first treating starting compound of formula 5, which may be prepared according to methods familiar to those skilled in the art, with thionyl chloride in anhydrous dichloromethane at reflux temperature (about 38-42°C at atmospheric pressure) to obtain the compound of formula 3. The compound of formula 2 may be obtained by treating the compound of formula 3 with the compound of formula 4 in an organic solvent, such as DMF, DMSO, THF, MeCN, or a mixture of two or more of the foregoing solvents, preferably MeCN, at a temperature ranging from 50°C to reflux, preferably reflux. The foregoing acronyms are as defined in the Summary of the Invention, referred to above. The compound of formula 1 may be prepared by treating the compound of formula 2 with an alkali-metal or alkaline-metal hydroxide in a solvent comprising d-Cio alky) substituted by at least one hydroxy group where G is -C(OH)R3R4, or with a tetra-(C1-C6 alkyl)-ammonium fluoride compound in an aprotic solvent where G is -SiR3R4R5 Where G is -C(OH)R3R4, the solvent is preferably a secondary alcohol, such as butan-2-ol or isopropanol, said alkali-metal or alkaline-metal hydroxide may be selected from sodium hydroxide, lithium hydroxide, cesium hydroxide, calcium hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide and potassium hydroxide, preferably sodium hydroxide, and the reaction is preferably run at a temperature ranging from about 100°C to about 150°C. Where G is -SiR3R4R5, the tetra-(C,-C6 alkyl)-ammonium fluoride compound is preferably tetra-(n-butyl)-ammonium fluoride, the aprotic solvent may be selected from THF, diethyl ether, DME, toluene, dichloromethane, chloroform, and a mixture of two or more of the foregoing solvents, preferably THF, and the reaction is preferably conducted a temperature ranging from about room temperature to about 70°C. The anti-cancer compounds of formula 1 may be converted to pharmaceutically acceptable salts as described below.<br>
In Scheme 2, anti-cancer compounds of formulas 6 and 7 may be prepared by treating intermediate of formula 8 with a primary or secondary alcohol of formula R7-OH, wherein R7 is as defined above, in the presence of an alkali-metal or alkaline-metal hydroxide such as sodium hydroxide, lithium hydroxide, cesium hydroxide, calcium hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide, preferably sodium hydroxide, at a temperature ranging from about 100°C to about 150°C. Use of a secondary alcohol of formula R7-OH will minimize conversion to the asymmetric analogue of formula 7, while use of a primary alcohol of formula R7-OH will increase the relative concentration of the asymmetric analogue of formula 7. Thus, depending on the analogue that is preferred, a secondary or primary alcohol<br>
may be preferred. The compounds of formula 6 and 7 may be separated by various methods, such as chromatography, which are familiar to those skilled in the art. The compounds of formula 6 and 7 may be converted to pharmaceutically acceptable salts as described below<br>
In Scheme 3, compounds of formula 9 may be prepared by treating compounds of formula 10 with a primary or secondary alcohol of formula R7-OH as described above in reference to Scheme 2. Since the goal of the reaction of Scheme 3 is the preparation of the asymmetric analogue, the use of primary alcohol of formula R7-OH is preferred. The compounds of formula 9 may be converted to pharmaceutically acceptable salts as described below.<br>
Certain compounds prepared according to the present invention referred to above may have asymmetric carbon atoms. Compounds having a mixture of isomers at one or more centers will exist as diastereomeric mixtures, which can be separated into their individual diastereomers on the basis of their physical chemical differences by methods known to those skilled in the art, for example, by chromatography or fractional crystallization. All such isomers, including diastereomer mixtures, are considered as part of the invention.<br>
The compounds referred to above that are basic in nature are capable of forming a wide variety of different salts with various inorganic and organic acids. Although such salts must be pharmaceutically acceptable for administration to mammals, it is often desirable in practice to initially isolate the compound of the present invention from the reaction mixture as a pharmaceutically unacceptable salt and then simply convert the latter back to the free base compound by treatment with an alkaline reagent and subsequently convert the latter free base to a pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt. The acid addition salts of the basic compounds of this invention are readily prepared by treating the basic compound with a substantially equivalent amount of the chosen mineral or organic acid in an aqueous solvent medium or in a suitable organic solvent, such as methanol or ethanol. Upon careful evaporation of the solvent, the desired solid salt is readily obtained. The desired acid salt can also be precipitated from a solution of the free base in an organic solvent by adding to the solution an appropriate mineral or organic acid<br>
Those compounds referred to above that are acidic in nature, are capable of forming base salts with various pharmacologically acceptable cations. Examples of such salts include the alkali metal or alkaline-earth metal salts and particularly, the sodium and potassium salts These salts are all prepared by conventional techniques The chemical bases which are used as reagents to prepare the pharmaceutically acceptable base salts of this invention are those which form non-toxic base salts with the acidic compounds of the present invention. Such non-toxic base salts include those derived from such pharmacologically acceptable cations as sodium, potassium, calcium and magnesium, etc. These salts can easily be prepared by treating the corresponding acidic compounds with an aqueous solution containing the desired alkali metal<br>
alkoxide or metal hydroxide, and then evaporating the resulting solution to dryness, preferably under reduced pressure. Alternatively, they may also be prepared by mixing lower alkanolic solutions of the acidic compounds and the desired alkali metal alkoxide or metal hydroxide together, and then evaporating the resulting solution to dryness in the same manner as before. In either case, stoichiometric quantities of reagents are preferably employed in order to ensure completeness of reaction and maximum yields of the desired final product.<br>
The Examples provided below further exemplify the methods and intermediates of the present invention, although it is understood that the scope of the present invention is not limited by the following examples.<br>
