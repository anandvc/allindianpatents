METHOD AND SYSTEM FOR CODE COMBINING IN A COMMUNICATION SYSTEM BACKGROUND Field<br>
The present invention relates to broadcast or multicast communications, otherwise known as point-to-multipoint communications, in a wireline or a wireless communication system. More particularly, the present invention relates to a system and method for code combining data from different base stations in a broadcast or multicast communication system.<br>
Background<br>
Communication systems have been developed to allow transmission of information signals from an origination station to a physically distinct destination station. In transmitting information signal from the origination station over a communication channel, the information signal is first converted into a form suitable for efficient transmission over the communication channel. Conversion, or modulation, of the information signal involves varying a parameter of a carrier wave in accordance with the information signal in such a way that the spectrum of the resulting modulated carrier is confined within the communication channel bandwidth. At the destination station the original information signal is replicated from the modulated carrier wave received over the communication channel. Such a replication is generally achieved by using an inverse of the modulation process employed by the origination station.<br>
Modulation also facilitates multiple-access, i. e. , simultaneous transmission and/or reception, of several signals over a common communication channel. Multiple-access communication systems often include a plurality of subscriber stations requiring intermittent service of relatively short duration rather than continuous access to the common communication channel. Several multiple-access techniques are known in the art, such as time division<br><br>
multiple-access (TDMA), frequency division multiple-access (FDMA), and amplitude modulation multiple-access (AM). Another type of a multiple-access technique is a code division multiple-access (CDMA) spread spectrum system that conforms tothe"TIA/EIA/IS-95 Mobile Station-Base Station Compatibility Standard for Dual-Mode Wide-Band Spread Spectrum Cellular System, " hereinafter referred to as theIS-95 standard. The use of CDMA techniques in a multiple-access communication system is disclosed in U. S. Patent No.4,901,307,entitled "SPREAD SPECTRUM MULTIPLE-ACCESS COMMUNICATION SYSTEM USING SATELLITE OR TERRESTRIAL REPEATERS," and U. S. Patent No. 5,103,459, entitled "SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR GENERATING WAVEFORMS IN A CDMA CELLULARTELEPHONE SYSTEM, "both assigned to the assignee of the present invention.<br>
A multiple-access communication system may be a wireless or wire- line and may carry voice and/or data. An example of a communication system carrying both voice and data is a system in accordance with theIS-95 standard, which specifies transmitting voice and data over the communication channel. A method for transmitting data in code channel frames of fixed size is described in detail in U. S. Patent No. 5,504,773, entitled "METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR THE FORMATTING OF DATA FOR TRANSMISSION", assigned to the assignee of the present invention. In accordance with theIS-95 standard, the data or voice is partitioned into code channel frames that are 20 milliseconds wide with data rates as high as 14.4 Kbps. Additional examples of a communication systems carrying both voice and data comprise communication systems conforming to the "3rd Generation Partnership Project" (3GPP), embodied in a set of documents including Document Nos. 3G TS 25.211, 3G TS 25.212, 3G TS 25.213, and 3G TS 25.214 (the W-CDMA standard), or "TR- 45.5 Physical Layer Standard for cdma2000 Spread Spectrum Systems, Release C" (theIS-2000 standard), also known as thelxEV-DV proposal.<br>
An example of a data only communication system is a high data rate (HDR) communication system that conforms to the TIA/EIA/IS-856 industry standard, hereinafter<br><br>
referred to as the IS-856 standard. This HDR system is based on a communication system disclosed in co-pending application serial number 08/963,386, entitled "METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR HIGH RATE PACKET DATA TRANSMISSION," filed November 3,1997, and assigned to the assignee of the present invention. The HDR communication system defines a set of data rates, ranging from 38.4 kbps to 2.4 Mbps, at which an access point (AP) may send data to a subscriber station (access terminal, AT). Because the AP is analogous to a base station, the terminology with respect to cells and sectors is the same as with respect to voice systems.<br>
In a multiple-access communication system, communications among users are conducted through one or more base stations. A first user on one subscriber station communicates to a second user on a second subscriber station by transmitting data on a reverse link to a base station. The base station receives the data and can route the data to another base station. The data is transmitted on a forward link of the same base station, or the other base station, to the second subscriber station. The forward link refers to transmission from a base station to a subscriber station and the reverse link refers to transmission from a subscriber station to a base station. Likewise, the communication can be conducted between a first user on one subscriber station and a second user on a landline station. A base station receives the data from the user on a reverse link, and routes the data through a public switched telephone network (PSTN) to the second user. In many communication systems, e. g.,IS-95, W-CDMA,IS- 2000, the forward link and the reverse link are allocated separate frequencies.<br>
The above described wireless communication service is an example of a point-to-point communication service. In contrast, broadcast or multicast services provide point-to-multipoint communication service. The basic model of a broadcast or multicast system consists of a broadcast or multicast net of users served by one or more central stations, which transmit information with a certain contents, e. g., news, movies, sports events and the like to the users. Each broadcast or multicast net user's subscriber station monitors a common broadcast or multicast forward link signal. Because the central station fixedly determines the content, the users are generally not communicating back. Examples of common usage of broadcast or<br><br>
multicast services communication systems are TV broadcast, radio broadcast, push-to-talk group calls, and the like. Such communication systems are generally highly specialized purpose-build communication systems. With the recent, advancements in wireless cellular telephone systems there has been an interest of utilizing the existing infrastructure of the-mainly point-to-point cellular telephone systems for broadcast or multicast services. (As used herein, the term "cellular" systems encompasses communication systems utilizing both cellular and PCS frequencies.)<br>
The information signal to be exchanged among the terminals in a communication system is often organized into a plurality of packets. For the purposes of this description, a packet is a group of bytes, including data (payload) and control elements, arranged into a specific format. The control elements comprise, e. g. , a preamble and a quality metric. The quality metric comprises, e. g., cyclical redundancy check (CRC), parity bit(s), and other types of metric known to one skilled in the art. The packets are usually formatted into a message in accordance with a communication channel structure. The message, appropriately modulated, traveling between the origination terminal and the destination terminal, is affected by characteristics of the communication channel, e. g., signal-to-noise ratio, fading, time variance, and other such characteristics. Such characteristics affect the modulated signal differently in different communication channels. Consequently, transmission of a modulated signal over a wireless communication channel requires different considerations than transmission of a modulated signal over a wire-like communication channel, e. g., a coaxial cable or an optical cable.<br>
In addition to selecting a modulation appropriate for a particular communication channel, other methods for protecting the information signal have been devised. Such methods comprise, e. g. , encoding, symbol repetition, interleaving, and other methods known to one of ordinary skill in the art. However, these methods increase overhead. Therefore, an engineering compromise between reliability of message delivery and the amount of overhead must be made. Even with the above-discussed protection of information, the conditions of the communication channel can degrade to the point at which the destination station possibly cannot decode (erases) some of the packets comprising the message. In data-only communications systems, the cure is<br><br>
to re-transmit the non-decoded packets using an Automatic Retransmission request (ARQ) made by the destination station to the origination station. However, as discussed, the subscribers do not communicate back to the base station. Furthermore, even if the subscribers were allowed to communicate ARQ, this communication might overload the communication system. Consequently, other means of information protection are desirable.<br>

Description<br>
A basic model of a broadcast or multicast system comprises a broadcast or multicast net of users, served by one or more central stations, which transmit information with a certain contents, e. g. , news, movies, sports events and the like to the users. Each broadcast or multicast net user's subscriber station monitors a common broadcast or multicast forward link signal. FIG. 1 illustrates a conceptual block diagram of a communication system 100, capable of performing High-Speed Broadcast or Multicast Service (HSBSMS) in accordance with an embodiment.<br>
The broadcast or multicast content originates at a content server (CS) 102. The content server may be located within the carrier network (not shown) or outside Internet(IP) 104. The content is delivered in a form of packets to a broadcast or multicast packet data-serving node (BPDSN) 106. The term BPSDN is used because although the BPDSN may be physically co-located, or be identical to a regular PDSN (not shown), the BPSDN may be logically different from a regular PDSN. The BPDSN 106 delivers the packets according to the packet's destination to a packet control function (PCF) 108. The PCF is a control entity controlling function of base stations 110 for the HSBS as a base station controller is for regular voice and data services. To illustrate the connection of the high level concept of the HSBS with the physical access network, FIG. 1 shows a PCF physically co-located or even identical, but logically different from a base station controller (BSC). The BSC/PCF 108 provides the packets to base stations 114.<br>
The communication system 100 enables High-Speed Broadcast or Multicast Service (HSBSMS) by introducing a forward broadcast or multicast shared channel (F-BSMSCH) 112 capable of high data rates that can be received by a large number of subscriber stations 114. The<br><br>
term forward broadcast or multicast shared channel is used herein to mean a single forward link physical channel that carries broadcast or multicast traffic. A single F- BSMSCH can carry one or more HSBSMS channels multiplexed in a TDM fashion within the single F-BSMSCH. The term HSBSMS channel is used herein to mean a single logical HSBSMS broadcast or multicast session defined by the session's broadcast or multicast content. Each session is defined by a broadcast or multicast content that may change with time; for example, 7am- News, Sam-Weather, 9am-Movies, etc. FIG. 2 illustrates the discussed concept of physical and logical channels for the HSBS in accordance with an embodiment.<br>
As illustrated in FIG. 2, an HSBS is provided on two F-BSCHs 202, each of which is transmitted on a separate frequency fx, fy. Thus, for example, in the above-mentioned cdma2000 communication system such a physical channel can comprise, e. g. , a forward supplemental channel (F-SCH), forward broadcast control channel (F-BCCH), forward common control channel (F- CCCH), other common and dedicated channels and the channel's combination. The use of common and dedicated channels for information broadcast is disclosed in a co-pending U. S. Patent Application Serial No. 10/113,098, entitled "METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR CHANNEL MANAGEMENT FOR POINT-TO-MULTIPOINT SERVICES IN A COMMUNICATION SYSTEM", filed March 28,2002, and assigned to the assignee of the present invention. One of ordinary skill in the art understands that other communication systems utilize channels performing similar function; therefore, the teaching is applicable to other communication systems.<br>
The F-BSMSCHs 202 carry the broadcast or multicast traffic, which may comprise one or more broadcast or multicast sessions. The F-BSCH1 carries two HSMSBS channels 204a, 204b, which are multiplexed onto the F- BCCH1 202a. The F-BSCH2 202b carries one HSBSMS channel 204c. The content of an HSBSMS channel is formatted into packets comprising a pay load 206 and a header 208.<br><br>
One of ordinary skill in the art recognizes that the HSBSMS broadcast or multicast service deployment as illustrated in FIG. 2 is for pedagogical purposes only. Therefore, in a given sector, the HSBSMS broadcast or multicast service can be deployed in several manners in accordance with features supported by an implementation of a particular communication system. The implementation features include, e. g. , the number of HSBSMS sessions supported, number of frequency assignments, number of broadcast or multicast physical channels supported, and other implementation features known to one skilled in the art. Thus, for example, more than two frequencies, and F- BSMSCHs may be deployed in a sector. Furthermore, more than two HSBSMS channels may be multiplexed onto one F-BSMSCH. Furthermore, a single HSBSMS channel can be multiplexed onto more than one broadcast or multicast channel within a sector, on different frequencies to serve the subscribers residing in those frequencies.<br>
As discussed, communications systems often transmit information in frames or blocks, which are protected by encoding against adverse condition affecting a communication channel. Examples of such systems include cdma2000, WCDMA, UMTS systems. As illustrated in FIG. 3, the bit stream of information to be transmitted 302, originating at higher layers, is provided to an encoder 304 on a physical layer. The encoder accepts a block of bits of a length S. This block of S bits typically includes some overhead, e. g., tail bits for the encoder, a cyclic redundancy check (CRC), and other overhead information known to one of ordinary skills in the art. The overhead bits assist the decoder at the receiving side to ascertain success or failure of decoding. The encoder then encodes the S bits with a selected code resulting in an encoded block of length P = S + R, where R denotes the number of redundant bits.<br>
One of ordinary skill in the art would understand that although the embodiments are explained in terms of a layering model, this is for pedagogical purposes, and the various illustrative logical blocks, modules, circuits, and algorithm steps described in connection with the physical layer can be implemented as electronic hardware, computer software, or combinations of both. Thus, for example, the encoder 304 may be implemented or performed<br><br>
with a general purpose processor, a digital signal processor (DSP), an application specific integrated circuit(ASIC), a field programmable gate array (FPGA) or other programmable logic device, discrete gate or transistor logic, discrete hardware components, or any combination thereof designed to perform the functions described herein. A general-purpose processor may be a microprocessor, but in the alternative, the processor may be any conventional processor, controller, microcontroller, or state machine. A processor may also be implemented as a combination of computing devices, e. g. , a combination of a DSP and a microprocessor, a plurality of microprocessors, one or more microprocessors in conjunction with a DSP core, or any other such configuration.<br>
FIG. 4 shows a block diagram illustrating the encoding, combining, and decoding of data in accordance with an embodiment. Given a 1 k bit stream of information is provided to encoder 412 that is a 1/2 rate encoder, then 2k bits are output from the encoder 412. In an embodiment, the encoder is located within a base station controller 410. In another embodiment, the encoder 412 is located within a base station. It would be understood by those skilled in the art that encoders and decoders of varying rates may be used in an embodiment.<br>
In accordance with an embodiment, the 2k bits are split by a splitter 414 such that a subset of the 2k bits are sent to each of a plurality of base stations. In an embodiment, the splitter 414 is located within the base station controller 410. It would be understood by those skilled in the art that the splitter 414 could be located separate from the base station controller 410. A subset is defined as a set contained within a set. The subset can contain the same number of members as the set, i. e. , the subset can equal the set. A subset can be an empty set. The subsets sent to the plurality of base stations can overlap and can be disjoint.<br>
For pedagogical purposes, only the subset of bits that are sent to the first base station 420 and to a base station N 430 are shown in FIG. 4. It would be understood by those skilled in the art that in a regressive case, there could be only one base station. It would also be understood by<br><br>
those skilled in the art that there could be any number of base stations N where N &gt; 1. Serving as an example, the subset comprising the first 1 k bits of the 2k bits are sent to the first base station 420 and the subset comprising the last 1.5k bits of the 2k bits is sent to the second base station N 430.<br>
Each base station 420 430 includes a modulator 422 432 that modulates the base station's input signal. After modulation, each base station sends its modulated signals to a mobile station 440. The mobile station 440 includes a demodulator 442 that demodulates the modulated signals from the plurality of base stations.<br>
The outputs of the demodulator 442 are provided to a combiner 446. In an embodiment, the combiner 446 utilizes parameters needed for combining 448 to combine bits from the plurality of base stations. The parameters indicate the position of the bits to be combined relative to their corresponding location in the 2k bit stream of information originally at the output of the encoder 412. The parameters are sent by the plurality of base stations in signaling from the plurality of base stations to the mobile station 440. It would also be understood by those skilled in the art that the combiner 446 could employ any combining scheme known in the art that increases the reliability of the combined bits.<br>
FIG. 5 shows a representation of the combining process of an embodiment as applied to an example. A first stream of bits 502A is sent from a first base station to a subscriber station and a second stream of bits 502B is sent from a second base station to the subscriber station. The first stream of bits 502A is demodulated and the demodulated stream of bits 504A are provided to the combiner 446. The second stream of bits 504B is demodulated and the demodulated stream of bits 504B are provided to the combiner 446. The combiner 446 combines the demodulated stream of bits 504A, 504B thereby creating a combined stream of bits 506. The stream of bits denoted by reference number 508 indicates the overlap between the demodulated stream of bits 504A and the demodulated stream of bits 504B.<br><br>
In reference to the example of FIG. 4, the combined stream of 2k bits are provided to a decoder 450, which is a 1/2 rate decoder. The 1/2 rate decoder 450 decodes the combined stream of 2k bits and outputs 1 k decoded bits.<br>
The combiner 446 may operate on any level of data. In an embodiment, the combiner 446 may operate at the bit level. In an embodiment, the combiner 446 may operate at a frame level. In an embodiment, the combiner 446 may operate at a symbol level. It would be understood by those skilled in the art that the combiner 446 may operate on any combination of data known in the art.<br>
FIG. 6 shows a flowchart of a method for code combining in a communication system in an embodiment. In step 602, information is encoded at a control center, and thereby creating encoded symbols. In an embodiment, the control center comprises a base station controller. In an embodiment, the control center comprises a base station.<br>
For pedagogical purposes, the method for code combining is shown with respect to a first base station 420 and a base station N 430. It would be understood by those skilled in the art that in a regressive case, there could be only one base station. It would also be understood by those skilled in the art that there could be any number of base stations N where N &gt; 1.<br>
In accordance with an embodiment, a subset of the encoded symbols are distributed to a plurality of base stations. In step 604, a part or all of the encoded symbols are distributed to the first base station 420. Likewise, in step 606, a part or all of the encoded symbols are distributed to the base station N 430, where N is the number of base stations that are distributed encoded symbols.<br>
In step 608, the encoded symbols received at the first base station 420 are modulated according to the available resources at the first base station 420. Likewise, in step 610, the<br><br>
encoded symbols received at the base station N 430 are modulated according to the available resources at the base station N 430. In an embodiment, available resources include power available at a given base station. In an embodiment, available resources include number of Walsh codes available at a given base station. In an embodiment, available resources include transmission duration.<br>
In step 612, the modulated symbols from the first base station 420 (from step 608) are transmitted on the F-PDCH for the first base station 420. Likewise, in step 614, the modulated symbols from base station N 430 (from step 610) are transmitted on the F-PDCH for base station N 430.<br>
In step 616, the modulated symbols from the first base station 420 are received at the mobile station. Like wise in step 618, the modulated symbols from base station N 430 are received at the mobile station.<br>
In step 620, the mobile station 440 acquires control information needed to receive the modulated symbols transmitted on the F-PDCH for the first base station 420. Likewise, in step 622, the mobile station 440 acquires control information needed to receive the modulated symbols transmitted on the F-PDCH for base station N 430.<br>
In step 624, utilizing the control information needed to receive the modulated symbols transmitted on the F-PDCH for the first base station 420, the modulated symbols from the first base station 420 (from step 612) are received at the mobile station 440. Likewise, in step 626, utilizing the control information needed to receive the modulated symbols transmitted on the F-PDCH for base station N 430, the modulated symbols from base station N 430 (from step 614) are received at the mobile station 440.<br><br>
In step 628, the modulated symbols received from the plurality of base stations are combined resulting in the combined signal, i. e. , the combined symbols being located within a decoder buffer.<br>
In step 630, the combined signal is decoded.<br>
In an embodiment, a block of information is encoded at a control center such as a BSC. The encoded symbols are then distributed to multiple base stations. Each base station then can transmit part or all of the encoded symbols.<br>
In an embodiment, a BSC distributes all encoded symbols to each base station. Each base station then decides whether it is going to transmit all or part of the symbols based on its available communication resources (power, Walsh code, time duration), modulates the selected symbols and transmit them.   In this case, there is no collaboration among base stations.<br>
In another embodiment, each base station periodically reports its available communication resources (power, Walsh code, time duration) to a BSC. The BSC then decides which base station is to transmit what part of the encoded symbols. The BSC operates to reduce the overlap of portions that are to be transmitted by different base stations and to reduce the occurrence of the same encoded symbols transmitted by multiple base stations. Thus, there is some collaboration among base stations. As a result of the collaboration, the effective code rate can be reduced.<br>
In an embodiment, at the receiver, the subscriber station figures out how to combine the symbols received from different base stations. From the information in the F-PDCCH associated with the F-PDCH, the subscriber station can figure out how many binary symbols were transmitted from each base station. However, additional information is still needed in order to combine the symbols from the different base stations.<br><br>
In an embodiment, a rule indicating which base stations transmit which symbols is defined apriori. In one embodiment, each base station has a default starting point within a bit stream to transmit symbols and the default starting points are known to the subscriber station. In another embodiment, a first base station always starts from the beginning of the bit stream to transmit symbols, and a second base station always starts from the end of the bit stream and works backward through the bit stream.<br>
In an embodiment, explicit signaling is used. Each base station signals to the subscriber station what symbols are being transmitted from the base station. The signaling can be a specification of the range of the selected symbols. It would be apparent to those skilled in the art that there are other means for signaling to the subscriber station an indication of what symbols are being transmitted from each base station.<br>
Those of skill in the art would understand that information and signals may be represented using any of a variety of different technologies and techniques. For example, data, instructions, commands, information, signals, bits, symbols, and chips that may be referenced throughout the above description may be represented by voltages, currents, electromagnetic waves, magnetic fields or particles, optical fields or particles, or any combination thereof<br>
