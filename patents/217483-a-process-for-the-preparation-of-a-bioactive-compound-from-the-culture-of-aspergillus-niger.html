Lipids are highly vulnerable to oxidation, which can be initiated by enzymatic and non-enzymatic processes. The enzymatic process is initiated by lipoxygenases, which are responsible for the oxygenation of polyunsaturated fatty acids such as linoleic, linolenic and arachadonic acid.<br>
These enzymes are found to be responsible for the deterioration, rancidity and loss of flavor in food materials and also for various diseases in the human body, such as Parkinson's disease, cataractogenesis, endotoxin liver injury, and myocardial infarction.

TAXONOMY<br>
Morphology<br>
The fungal mycelium on czapek's solution agar had abundant erect and<br>
crowded conidial structures, which is brownish black or dark brown covering<br>
the entire colony except for the narrow peripheral growing area. Conidial heads<br>
are globose initially, which slowly split into radiating columns at the end of 10<br>
days. Sclerotia are not observed.<br>
Cultural and physiological characteristics<br>
The growth characteristics of CFR-W-105 on malt-extract-agar are similar to<br>
that of Czapek's solution agar. But the colonies are deeper brownish black,<br>
reverse of the plate is uncolored and unwrinkled and conidiophores are less<br>
dense. Growing margin is less prominent. The culture grew well at ambient<br>
temperature of 26°-30°C. conidia is born by biseriate sterigmata (25-30A) and<br>
are 2.5-4.5n in size and globose at maturity. The walls are smooth arid thick.<br>
The length of conidiophores is 0.7-1.0 mm. Table 1 shows the growth of CRF-<br>
W-105 in the presence of various carbon and nitrogen sources. The basal<br>
medium of the above experiments contained Czapex solution agar for Carbon<br>
source and Czapex solution agar replacing sodium nitrate for nitrate source.<br>

carbon and nitrogen sources.<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Taxonomic position<br>
The strain CFR-W-105 is isolated from honeybee wax from local region. The characteristics indicated that the strain belongs to Aspergillus Niger group. According to the descriptions of Raper and Fennell ( Raper KB and Fennell DT (1965) The Genus Aspergillus; The Williams and Wilkins Co, Baltimore, pp 293-310), the strain CFR-W-105 is related to Aspergillus niger V. Tiegh. The taxonomic relationships between the strains and four other cultures that did not give the bioactive molecules during screening are compared and given in Table 2.<br>

(Table Removed)<br>
FERMENTATION Seed Culture<br>
Strain CFR W-105 is propagated on Potato Dextrose Agar (Hi Media Mumbai, India) slant composed of soluble starch 0.4 % and glucose 2 %. After incubation for 4 days at 30°C, a portion of the mature agar slant is inoculated into 100 ml of a seed liquid medium of the same medium composition in a 500-ml Erlenmeyer flask and incubated at 30°C on a rotary shaker at 250 rpm. Flask Fermentation<br>
A 5-ml of the seed culture is transferred into 250-ml Erlenmeyer flasks each containing 10 gm of wheat bran, 10 ml of 0.2 N HC1 comprising 2.1 mg each of ferrous sulfate, zinc sulfate and copper sulfate and 5 ml distilled water. The inoculated flasks are incubated for 5 days at 30°C. Isolation and Purification. The fermented wheat bran (450 g) is treated with ethyl acetate (1 liter) for two hours. The organic extract is separated from the wheat bran by cheesecloth filtration. This extract is dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and concentrated<br>
in vacuo to afford a crude solid (1.36 gm) and the residue is resuspended in<br>
chloroform (25 ml) and gently centrifuged (2000 rpm, 20 minutes, 27°C). The<br>
residue is dried to afford an orange colored active fraction (230-mg). This is<br>
dissolved in ethyl alcohol (50 ml) by gentle warming and treated with activated<br>
charcoal   (200  mg) filtered  (Whatman   No.l) while warm.  The  filtrate  is<br>
concentrated in vacuo to obtain 30 mg of yellow amorphous powder.<br>
Physico-chemical properties<br>
The compound is amorphous yellow powder. It is soluble in ethanol, methanol,<br>
ethyl  acetate,  dimethyl  sulphoxide,  sodium   bicarbonate  solution,   sodium<br>
carbonate solution and sodium hydroxide solution, slightly soluble in chloroform<br>
and hexane, but insoluble in water. The EI-MS spectra of the compound<br>
showed the molecular ions at m/z 265.<br>
Compositions and Methods<br>
The   novel   compounds  of the  invention  can   be  used   in   a  variety of<br>
pharmaceutical dosage forms. Thus, oral, parental, nasal, topical, buccal,<br>
ocular and other forms can be used. When such forms are formulated they will<br>
include pharmaceutically acceptable excipients such as colorants, carriers,<br>
perfumes, stabilizers, flow modifiers and the like in suitable amounts (i.e., from<br>
0.001 to 0.99wt%).<br>
The compound of the invention is useful in methods of inhibiting the effects of<br>
13-LOX.<br>
The compound is also used to treat a host, preferable a mammal, which is<br>
suffering from a disorder associated with a metabolism of 13-LOX, such as<br>
asthma, hypersensitivity, psoriasis, inflammatory conditions and complications<br>
arising from diabetes.<br>
The following example illustrates the 13-Lipoxygenase inhibitor effects of the novel compound, however this shall not be considered as limiting the scope of the present invention.<br>
EXAMPLE<br>
Soybean lipoxygenase (LOX-1) is purified according to the method of Axelrod et al., lipoxygenase from soybeans. Methods in Enzymology 1981, 71, 441-451, using the Hardee variety of soybean, after dehulling and defatting by hexane. The substrate, sodium linoleate (10 mM) is prepared as follows: To 70 mg of linoleic acid an equal weight of Tween-20 and 4 ml of oxygen free water is added and homogenized by drawing back and forth in a pasture pipette, avoiding air bubbles. Sufficient quantity of 0.5 N NaOH is added to this to yield a clear solution. The resulting sodium linoleate is divided into 1-2 ml portions in small screw cap vials, flushed with N2 before closing, and keep frozen until needed. Enzyme reaction is carried out at 25°C in a quartz cuvette with a 1 cm light path. The assay mixture contained (2.975 - x) ml of borate buffer (0.2 M, pH 9.0), 0.025 ml of sodium linoleate substrate, and x mL of enzyme. After each addition the mixture is stirred with a few strokes of a plastic paddler. The reference cuvette contained no enzyme. Absorption at 234 nm is recorded, and the reaction rate is determined from the slope of the straight-line portion of the curve.<br>
Lens are collected from rat eyes and homogenised with sodium, potassium phosphate buffer (0.135 M, pH 7.0) containing 0.5 mM of phenyl methyl sulphonyl fluoride and 10 mM of p-mercaptoethanol. The homogenate is centrifuged at 10,000 r.p.m for 30 minutes at 4°C. The supernatant is taken as enzyme source. Enzyme reaction is carried out at 25°C in a quartz cuvette with<br>
a 1-cm light path. The assay mixture contained 100 µL of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate tetra sodium salt (from a stock solution of 9.6 mM), 100 µL of DL-glyceraldehyde (from a stock solution of 250 mM), 10 µL of inhibitor dissolved in dimethyl sulphoxide, sodium-potassium-phosphate buffer (0.135 M, pH 7.0) to make up the total volume to 3 µL and the reaction is initiated by the addition of 200 µL of enzyme solution. The enzyme reaction is monitored by the decrease in absorbency at 340 nm and compared with enzyme reaction without inhibitor. Results<br>
The bioactive compound having molecular formula C13H15NO5 is discovered in the fermented bran of a species of Aspergillus Niger CFR W-105 (= ATCC...). The compound is successfully purified to homogeneity. The IC50 value of the compound against purified soybean lipoxygenase and crude rat lens aldose reductase inhibitory activity is determined to be 79n moles and 69n moles respectively.<br><br><br><br><br>
