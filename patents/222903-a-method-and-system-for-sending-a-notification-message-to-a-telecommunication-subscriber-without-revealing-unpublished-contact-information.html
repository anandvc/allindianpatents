				<td>A Method And System For Sending A Notification Message<br>
To A Telecommunication Subscriber Without Revealing<br>
Unpublished Contact Information<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0001] This invention relates generally to telecommunications and more<br>
particularly to contacting subscribers of telecommunications services without<br>
revealing unpublished contact information.<br>
[0002] Conventional landline telecommunications systems have been in<br>
existence for many years. Landline telecommunications involve the physical<br>
coupling through a conductive medium, such as a copper wire or optical fiber,<br>
between locations having transceiving equipment, such as telephones. Until<br>
fairly recently, most non-military communications have occurred via landlines.<br>
More recently, radio frequency-based communications have become<br>
commercially viable for the mass market. This form of analog or digital<br>
communication requires no physical conduction medium and so is termed<br>
"wireless." Wireless communications free the user from the obligation of<br>
remaining proximate to the base equipment associated with landline<br>
communications. Instead, signal transmission occurs via satellites, wireless<br>
booster towers, and miniaturized transceivers that form part of the mobile<br>
wireless communication equipment.<br>
[0003] In order for communications to occur between two or more locations<br>
having telecommunications equipment, it has been necessary for at least one<br>
of those locations to know the contact information (telephone number, e-mail<br>
address, etc.) for the other location or locations to be contacted. This need<br>
gave rise to the development of databases or directories of contact<br>
information for specific telecommunications system-equipped locations. One<br>
obvious example of such a database or directory is the telephone book, which<br>
provides a listing of contact telephone numbers for individuals and businesses<br>
within a specified region. Additionally, local and national directory assistance<br><br>
providers generate and supply contact information upon telephonic request.<br>
In operation, communicators of directory assistance service providers retrieve<br>
from a series of database choices the information of interest and convey it to<br>
the interested party.<br>
[0004] Some estimates indicate that as many as ten billion calls are made<br>
for directory assistance for telephone numbers per annum throughout the<br>
world, indicating the importance of such contact information. Further, as use<br>
of the Internet expands, alternative databases of telephone numbers,<br>
facsimile numbers, e-mail addresses, web site addresses, and the like are<br>
made accessible by way of computer devices, such as personal computers.<br>
Necessarily, given the scope of interest in obtaining such contact information<br>
telephonically and by computer, the value of directory assistance providers<br>
has increased.<br>
[0005] However, many subscribers of telecommunications service wish to<br>
prevent widespread dissemination of their contact information for various<br>
reasons such as privacy concerns, desire to prevent unsolicited calls, etc.<br>
Telecommunications service providers accommodate these subscribers by<br>
not publishing their contact information. Unpublished or "unlisted" contact<br>
information cannot be disseminated by directory assistance providers,<br>
meaning that directory assistance requestors of unpublished information are<br>
denied access to the contact information.<br><br>
Patent No. U.S. 6,343,120 is directed toward a caller. ID system intended<br>
to mask a calling party's private information. It fails to teach sending a notification<br>
message to a telecommunication subscriber having unpublished contact<br>
information, sending the notification message in the form of a text message,<br>
charging a fee for sending that message, and sending the notification text<br>
message without revealing unpublished subscriber contact information (i.e.<br>
confidential contact information of the called party). It fails to address sending a<br>
notification message of any sort. U.S. 6,3431,230 inherently requires the calling<br>
party to know the called party's contact information. That later requirement<br>
precludes sending a notification text message to an unpublished subscriber<br>
without revealing that subscriber's contact information. The present invention<br>
provides a capability for calling parties to provide alias information to a called<br>
party in lieu of merely identifying the calling party by some expression such as<br>
private or anonymous. The invention of U.S. 6,343,120 lacks an element of<br>
sending a notification message of any type to an unpublished subscriber. It<br>
inherently requires that the calling party already know contact information of the<br>
called party.<br>
[0006] Accordingly, it would be desirable to have a system and method in which<br>
unpublished subscribers (i.e., subscribers for whom contact information is not<br>
published) can be contacted without revealing the unpublished contact<br>
information.<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0007] The above-mentioned need is met by the present invention, which<br>
provides a system and method in which unpublished subscribers of<br>
telecommunications services are able to receive a notification that an<br>
individual is trying to contact them, via directory assistance or a web-based<br>
request. The notification can be marked as being an emergency, urgent<br>
business, personal or other. The unpublished subscriber receiving such a<br>
notification has the choice to call back or ignore the request. The system<br>
provides the notification without revealing the unpublished contact<br>
information.<br>
[0008] The present invention and its advantages over the prior art will be<br>
more readily understood upon reading the following detailed description and<br>
the appended claims with reference to the accompanying drawings.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
[0009] The subject matter that is regarded as the invention is particularly<br>
pointed out and distinctly claimed in the concluding part of the specification.<br>
The invention, however, may be best understood by reference to the following<br>
description taken in conjunct/on with the accompanying drawing figures in<br>
which:<br>
[0010] Figure 1 is a schematic block diagram of a first embodiment of a<br>
subscriber notification system.<br>
[0011 ] Figure 2 depicts a representative notification message screen.<br>
[0012] Figure 3 is a schematic block diagram of a second embodiment of a<br>
subscriber notification system.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0013] Referring to the drawings wherein identical reference numerals<br>
denote the same elements throughout the various views, Figure 1 shows a<br>
first embodiment of a telecommunications system 10 for sending unpublished<br>
subscribers a secure notification message (in the form of a text message) that<br>
a request has been made for their unpublished contact information. The<br>
system 10 includes a central network station 20. The network station 20 is a<br>
computing device (or a coordinated collection of plural computing devices)<br>
having mass storage capability and means for carrying out software-based<br>
instructions. The network station 20 is preferably a minicomputer or a<br>
mainframe computer but is not limited thereto. The network station 20 is<br>
programmable to receive and,store contact information including, but not<br>
limited to, the access numbers of any of a plurality of communication devices<br>
30 (identified by the abbreviation "CD" in the drawings) used by subscribers of<br>
various service providers and contact-identifying information associated with<br>
those numbers, e.g., the subscriber's name and address. The system 10 can<br>
operate with any number of telecommunications service providers,<br>
represented in Figure 1 by service provider database or local exchange<br>
carrier stations 40. Each service provider station 40 is typically associated<br>
with a multitude of the subscriber communication devices 30. In this<br>
embodiment, the subscriber communication devices 30 can be any type of<br>
communications device (landline telephone, wireless telephone, pager, etc.)<br>
capable of receiving text messages.<br>
[0014] The contact information corresponding to each communication<br>
device 30 is obtained by the network station 20 through the respective service<br>
provider stations 40. The network station 20 preferably includes<br>
telecommunications routing and switching equipment so as to be capable of<br>
operating as a telecommunications station. Therefore, the network station is<br>
assured of gaining access to the contact information of the service providers'<br>
subscribers because it is a matter of legislative obligation that such service<br>
providers provide to any other telecommunications service provider the<br>
contact information of its subscribers. The system 10 includes a<br>
router/Communicator Identification Code (CIC) switch station 50 that enables<br><br>
the central network station 20 to interface with the service provider stations<br>
40.<br>
[0015] The contact information received by the central network station 20<br>
from the service provider stations 40 is formatted as necessary to enable<br>
various directory assistance service providers (collectively represented in<br>
Figure 1 by a single site 60, although it should be understood that multiple<br>
directory assistance service providers can interface with the central network<br>
station 20) to interface with the network station 20 and query it for contact<br>
information, possibly in exchange for a fee. The manipulation of that<br>
information results in a unified database of telecommunications device users.<br>
In effect, the network station 20 is a routing, switching, data storage, and<br>
interface system. All communications with the various stations to which the<br>
central station 20 is coupled may occur through digital, analog, T1, T3, CAT5,<br>
frame-based data transport protocois, asynchronous mode transport<br>
protocols, among others. The central network station 20 periodically polls the<br>
service provider stations 40 (preferably one or more times per day) and is<br>
continuously accessible by directory assistance provider contact sites 60<br>
worldwide so as to provide essentially real-time contact information.<br>
[0016] Directory assistance providers can provide individual users access<br>
to the system 10 through a variety of means. Two primary directory<br>
assistance access means include a "call center" approach in which a user or<br>
requestor contacts the directory assistance provider contact site 60 directly by<br>
calling the site 60 with a landline or wireless tefephone 70 and a "web portal"<br>
approach in which the requestor uses a web-enabled device 80 such as a<br>
personal computer, PDA, web-enabled wireless phone or the like to contact<br>
the site 60 via the Internet 90 (or other computer network). Alternatively, a<br>
requestor can directly access a web portal provided on the central network<br>
station 20 using the web-enabled device 80. It should be noted that the<br>
directory assistance provider contact sites 60 could also connect to the central<br>
network station 20 via the Internet 90.<br><br>
[0017] The components of the system 10 described herein operate in<br>
conjunction such that contact information may be transmitted, stored, or<br>
retrieved, or any combination thereof. Means such as software is employed<br>
to establish the interrelationships among the network station 20, subscriber<br>
communication devices 30, service provider stations 40, and directory<br>
assistance provider contact sites 60. Those skilled in the art of software<br>
development will readily ascertain the details of programming the exchange of<br>
information based upon the following exemplar representation of the operation<br>
of the system 10.<br>
[0018] In operation, a requestor contacts the directory assistance provider<br>
contact site 60 using the telephone 70 or web-enabled device 80 (or any other<br>
suitable means) to request the contact information (such as wireless number,<br>
landline number, fax number, email address, shipping address, vacation<br>
number, temporary number, emergency number, personal directory number,<br>
and pager number) of a particular telecommunications service subscriber.<br>
The directory assistance provider contact site 60 then interfaces with the<br>
central network station 20 to search the collection of subscriber contact<br>
information stored therein. If that particular subscriber's contact information is<br>
published, then the direct assistance provider simply provides the requested<br>
information in the normal manner. However, if that particular subscriber's<br>
contact information is unpublished (i.e., unlisted), then the directory<br>
assistance provider will notify the requestor that the requested information is<br>
unpublished and cannot be given out. The directory assistance provider will<br>
also provide the requestor with an opportunity to indirectly send the particular<br>
subscriber a secure notification message (in the form of a text message)<br>
preferably, but not necessarily, in exchange for a fee. Through the notification<br>
message, the requestor will be able to communicate to the subscriber a<br>
request that the subscriber contact the requestor.<br>
[0019] Another possible feature of the present invention would be to give<br>
unpublished subscribers the option of electing not to receive any notification<br><br>
messages. Unpublished subscribers electing this option would be identified in<br>
the system as being "locked out." In this case, when a request is made for the<br>
contact information of an unpublished subscriber having locked out status, the<br>
directory assistance provider will simply notify the requestor that the<br>
requested information is unpublished and cannot be given out. The requestor<br>
will be not given an opportunity to indirectly send the particular subscriber a<br>
secure notification message.<br>
[0020] If the requestor declines the offer to indirectly send a notification<br>
message, then the process stops at that point. If the requestor accepts the<br>
offer to indirectly send a notification message, the information relating to the<br>
notification message is collected. Specifically, the content of the notification<br>
message is ascertained. This is preferably done through a notification<br>
message screen generated by the central network station 20. If the requestor<br>
has contacted the directory assistance provider contact site 60 using the<br>
telephone 70, then the notification message screen appears to the directory<br>
assistance operator (who has accessed the network station 20 via the<br>
Internet). The directory assistance operator obtains the pertinent message<br>
information from the requestor over the telephone connection and enters this<br>
information into the notification message screen. If the requestor has<br>
contacted the directory assistance provider contact site 60 using the web-<br>
enabled device 80, then the notification message screen appears on the<br>
display of the web-enabled device 80 and the requestor enters the pertinent<br>
message information directly into the notification message screen. The later<br>
process would be the case regardless of whether the requestor accessed the<br>
system via a web portal operated by the directory assistance provider or a<br>
web portal running on the central network station 20.<br>
[0021] Figure 2 shows a representative notification message screen. The<br>
notification message screen has a number of text boxes in which the<br>
requestor/directory assistance operator is able to enter information about the<br>
notification message. These boxes include: a Name box 11 in which the<br><br>
requestor's name is entered, a Call Back Number box 12 in which an access<br>
number (e.g., for a telephone, pager or the like) at which the requestor can be<br>
reached is entered, and a Secondary Call Back Number box 13 in which an<br>
additional access number at which the requestor can be reached can be<br>
entered. The notification message screen also includes a Subject box 14 in<br>
which a brief message identifier is entered; the Subject box 14 can be set up<br>
to always display a brand identifier for the notification messaging service. A<br>
Message Type box 15 is provided for tagging the type of message. This can<br>
be in the form of a pull-down menu having numerous tag options such as<br>
Emergency, Urgent, Personal, and Business. A Message box 16 is provided<br>
in which the text message the requestor wishes to relay to the subscriber is<br>
entered. The notification message screen also includes a Count box 17 that<br>
displays a running total of the alpha-numeric characters of the message<br>
entered in the Message box 16. This count is useful to the requestor/directory<br>
assistance operator when entering the message because text messages are<br>
generally limited to a maximum number of alpha-numeric characters (typically<br>
150 characters). The notification message screen can include branding<br>
information 18, as shown in the upper right corner, such as service provider<br>
logos and such.<br>
[0022] The notification message screen includes a Send button 21 and a<br>
Cancel button 22. Once all of the message information has been entered, the<br>
requestor/directory assistance operator selects or "clicks on" the Send button<br>
21 to send the notification message. The Cancel button 22 can be clicked at<br>
anytime prior to clicking the Send button 21 to cancel the message. When the<br>
Send button 21 is clicked, the notification message screen is replaced on the<br>
directory assistance operator display or the display of the web-enabled device<br>
80, depending on by which means the requestor has accessed the system 10,<br>
with a confirmation screen. The confirmation screen gives the requestor a<br>
last opportunity to cancel the message or to send the message and to accept<br>
the charges if a fee is applied.<br><br>
[0023] To send the message, the central network station 20 identifies the<br>
subscriber's telecommunications service provider and access number from<br>
the information stored in the network station 20. The network station 20 then<br>
sends an e-mail containing the notification message to the subscriber's<br>
access number at the telecommunications service provider's text messaging<br>
domain. Any form of text messaging, such as SMS (Short Messaging<br>
Service), can be employed. The e-mail travels over the Internet backbone to<br>
the telecommunications service provider's text messaging domain. At the<br>
telecommunications service provider's text messaging domain, the e-mail is<br>
transmitted over the appropriate communication network (e.g., CDMA, TDMA,<br>
GSM, etc.) to the subscriber's communication device 30. The intended<br>
subscriber thus receives the notification message. Because the e-mail<br>
containing the notification message originated at the central network station<br>
20, the unpublished contact information is not revealed to the requestor and is<br>
thus secure.<br>
[0024] In many instances, the central network station 20 will be able to<br>
obtain or have access to the subscriber's regular e-mail address. In such<br>
cases, the central network station 20 could optionally send an e-mail<br>
containing the notification message to the subscriber's regular e-mail address<br>
in addition to the text message sent to the subscriber's communication device<br>
30. The additional e-mail notification would thus serve as a supplement or<br>
back-up to the text message.<br>
[0025] When the subscriber receives the notification message on the<br>
communication device 30, he or she has the option of saving the text<br>
message on the communication device 30 or deleting the text message. The<br>
subscriber also has the option of contacting the requestor at the number(s)<br>
provided or ignoring the request. Preferably, the subscriber receiving a<br>
notification message is not charged a fee. However, the subscriber has the<br>
further option of using the system 10 to return the call; that is, causing the<br>
central network station 20 to connect the subscriber's communication device<br><br>
30 to the requestor's contact number. If choosing this option, the subscriber<br>
could further elect to block the Caller ID function. The subscriber could be<br>
charged a fee for this service.<br>
[0026] Referring now to Figure 3, a second embodiment of a<br>
telecommunications system 110 for sending unpublished subscribers a<br>
secure notification message (at least partially in the form of a voice message)<br>
that a request has been made for their unpublished contact information. The<br>
system 110 includes a central network station 120. The network station 120<br>
is a computing device (or a coordinated collection of plural computing<br>
devices) having mass storage capability and means for carrying out software-<br>
based instructions. The network station 120 is preferably a minicomputer or a<br>
mainframe computer but is not limited thereto. The network station 120 is<br>
programmable to receive and store contact information including, but not<br>
limited to, the access numbers of any of a plurality of communication devices<br>
130 used by subscribers of various service providers and contact-identifying<br>
information associated with those numbers, e.g., the subscriber's name and<br>
address. The system 110 can operate with any number of<br>
telecommunications service providers, represented in Figure 3 by service<br>
provider database or local exchange carrier stations 140. Each service<br>
provider station 140 is associated with a multitude of the subscriber<br>
communication devices 130. In this embodiment, the subscriber<br>
communication devices 130 can be any type of communications device<br>
(landline telephone, wireless telephone, pager, etc.) capable of receiving<br>
voice mail messages.<br>
[0027] The contact information associated with the subscriber<br>
communication devices 130 is obtained by the network station 120 through<br>
the respective service provider stations 140. The network station 120<br>
preferably includes telecommunications routing and switching equipment so<br>
as to be capable of operating as a telecommunications station. Therefore, the<br>
network station 120 is assured of gaining access to the contact information of<br><br>
the service providers' subscribers because it is a matter of legislative<br>
obligation that such service providers provide to any other<br>
telecommunications service provider the contact information of its<br>
subscribers. The system 110 includes a router/Communicator Identification<br>
Code (CIC) switch station 150 that enables the central network station 120 to<br>
interface with the service provider stations 140.<br>
[0028] The contact information received by the central network station 120<br>
from the service provider stations 140 is formatted as necessary to enable<br>
various directory assistance service providers (collectively represented in<br>
Figure 3 by a single site 160, although it should be understood that multiple<br>
directory assistance service providers can interface with the central network<br>
station 120) to interface with the network station 120 and query it for contact<br>
information, possibly in exchange for a fee. The directory assistance provider<br>
contact sites 160 preferably interface with the central network station 120 via<br>
the Internet. The manipulation of that information results in a unified database<br>
of telecommunications device users. In effect, the network station 120 is a<br>
routing, switching, data storage, and interface system. All communications<br>
with the various stations to which the central station 120 is coupled may occur<br>
through digital, analog, T1, T3, CAT5, frame-based data transport protocols,<br>
asynchronous mode transport protocols, among others. The central network<br>
station 120 periodically polls the service provider stations 140 (preferably one<br>
or more times per day) and is continuously accessible by directory assistance<br>
provider contact sites 160 worldwide so as to provide essentially real-time<br>
contact information.<br>
[0029] In this embodiment, directory assistance providers provide<br>
individual users access to the system 110 through a "call center" approach in<br>
which a user or requestor contacts the directory assistance provider contact<br>
site 160 directly by calling the site 160 with a landline or wireless telephone<br>
170. The system 110 further includes a voice recorder 175 that interfaces<br><br>
with the central network station 120. The purpose of the voice recorder 175 is<br>
described below.<br>
[0030] The components of the system 110 described herein operate in<br>
conjunction such that contact information may be transmitted, stored, or<br>
retrieved, or any combination thereof. Means such as software is employed<br>
to establish the interrelationships among the network station 120, subscriber<br>
communication devices 130, service provider stations 140, directory<br>
assistance provider contact sites 160, and voice recorder 175. Those skilled<br>
in the art of software development will readily ascertain the details of<br>
programming the exchange of information based upon the following exemplar<br>
representation of the operation of the system 110.<br>
[0031] In operation, a requestor contacts the directory assistance provider<br>
contact site 160 using the telephone 170 to request the contact information<br>
(such as wireless number, landline number, fax number, email address,<br>
shipping address, vacation number, temporary number, emergency number,<br>
personal directory number, and pager number) of a particular<br>
telecommunications service subscriber. The directory assistance provider<br>
contact site 160 then interfaces with the central network station 120 to search<br>
the collection of subscriber contact information stored therein. If that<br>
particular subscriber's contact information is published, then the direct<br>
assistance provider simply provides the requested information in the normal<br>
manner. However, if that particular subscriber's contact information is<br>
unpublished (i.e., unlisted), then the directory assistance provider will notify<br>
the requestor that the requested information is unpublished and cannot be<br>
given out. The directory assistance provider will also provide the requestor<br>
with an opportunity to indirectly send the particular subscriber a secure<br>
notification message (at least partially in the form of a voice message)<br>
preferably, but not necessarily, in exchange for a fee. Through the notification<br>
message, the requestor will be able to communicate to the subscriber a<br>
request that the subscriber contact the requestor.<br><br>
[0032] If the requestor declines the offer to indirectly send a notification<br>
message, then the process stops at that point. If the requestor accepts the<br>
offer to indirectly send a notification message, the directory assistance<br>
provider connects the requestor to the voice recorder 175, as represented by<br>
the dashed line in Figure 3. The requestor is then prompted to record a<br>
notification message for the subscriber, including one or more call back<br>
numbers that the requestor can be reached at, and then press a certain key<br>
on the telephone 170 when finished with the message. When the requestor<br>
presses the predetermined key, he or she will be able to use various other<br>
keys on the telephone 170 to select options such as save and send the<br>
message, rerecord the message, enter a reply phone number, and delete the<br>
message. When the requestor opts to send the notification message, he or<br>
she can be given a last opportunity to confirm the choice to send the message<br>
and to accept the charges if a fee is applied.<br>
[0033] To send the message, the central network station 120 identifies the<br>
subscriber's telecommunications service provider and access number from<br>
the information stored in the network station 120. The network station 120<br>
then sends an e-mail indicating that the subscriber has a notification message<br>
to the subscriber's access number at the telecommunications service<br>
provider's text messaging domain. Any form of text messaging, such as SMS<br>
(Short Messaging Service), can be employed. The e-mail travels over the<br>
Internet backbone to the telecommunications service provider's text<br>
messaging domain. At the telecommunications service provider's text<br>
messaging domain, the e-mail is transmitted over the appropriate<br>
communication network (e.g., CDMA, TDMA, GSM, etc.) to the subscriber's<br>
communication device 130. The intended subscriber thus receives a text<br>
message indicating that he or she has a voice-recorded notification message.<br>
Because the e-mail originated at the central network station 120, the<br>
unpublished contact information is not revealed to the requestor and is thus<br>
secure.<br><br>
[0034] When the subscriber receives the text message on the<br>
communication device 130, he or she has the option of ignoring the message,<br>
listening to the voice message or connecting to the reply number. If the<br>
subscriber elects to listen to the voice message, the communication device<br>
130 is connected to the network station 120. The network station 120 verifies<br>
the subscriber by recognizing the communication device 130 through Caller<br>
ID or by requesting the subscriber to enter the access number of the<br>
communication device 130. After verification, the network station 120<br>
connects the subscriber to the voice message on the voice recorder 175 and<br>
instructs the subscriber to press a particular key on the communication device<br>
130. When the subscriber presses the particular key, he or she will be able to<br>
use various other keys on the communication device 130 to select options<br>
such as repeat the message, save the message, and connect to the requestor<br>
without disclosing the contact information.<br>
[0035] Generally, the subscriber receiving a notification message is not<br>
charged a fee. However, the subscriber could be charged a fee for being<br>
connected to the requestor without disclosing the subscriber's contact<br>
information.<br>
[0036] The second embodiment can also be used as an alternative voice<br>
mail system for subscribers of telecommunications services, particularly<br>
telephone service. This usage is applicable to subscribers having published<br>
contact information as well as unpublished subscribers. As is well known,<br>
voice mail service allows a subscriber to receive voice recorded messages<br>
when his or her telephone is turned off, busy, or not answered. Typically,<br>
subscribers are charged an additional monthly fee for voice mail service. The<br>
system 110 can be implemented such that subscribers, both published and<br>
unpublished, can receive voice recorded messages while avoiding additional<br>
monthly fees. Specifically, when an incoming call to a communication device<br>
130 is not answered for whatever reason (e.g., the number is busy, the<br>
telephone is turned off, etc.), the caller would be connected to the voice<br><br>
recorder 175. The caller is then prompted to record a message for the<br>
subscriber (typically for a fee), in the same manner as that described above<br>
with respect to a directory assistance requestor. When the caller finishes the<br>
message recording process, the system 110 operates in the same manner<br>
described above to send the subscriber a text message that he or she has a<br>
voice-recorded message. The subscriber can then retrieve the message, if<br>
desired, in the same manner described above. This alternative usage of<br>
system 110 can also be employed by having directory assistance providers<br>
provide directory assistance requestors of published with an opportunity to<br>
indirectly send the subscriber a voice-recorded message, preferably in<br>
exchange for a fee.<br>
[0037] While specific embodiments of the present invention have been<br>
described, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various<br>
modifications thereto can be made without departing from the spirit and scope<br>
of the invention as defined in the appended claims.<br><br>
