				<td>DIPEPTIDE NITRILES<br>
This invention relates to inhibitors of cysteine proteases, in particular to dipeptide nitrile cathepsin inhibitors and to their pharmaceutical use for the treatment or prophylaxis of diseases or medical conditions in which cathepsins are implicated.<br>
The cysteine cathepsins, e.g. cathepsins B, K, L and S, are a class of lysosomal enzymes which are implicated in various disorders including inflammation, rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, osteoporosis, tumors (especially tumor invasion and tumor metastasis), coronary disease, atherosclerosis (including atherosclerotic plaque rupture and destabilization), autoimmune diseases, respiratory diseases, infectious diseases and immunologically mediated diseases (including transplant rejection).<br>
In accordance with the invention it has been found that dipeptide nitriles are particularly useful as cysteine cathepsin inhibitors and can be used for the treatment of the above-cited cysteine cathepsin dependent conditions.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides an N-terminal-substituted dipeptide nitrile, i.e. a dipeptide in which the C-terminal carboxy group of the dipeptide is replaced by a nitrile group (-ON) and in which the N-terminal nitrogen atom is substituted via a peptide or pseudopeptide linkage which optionally additionally comprises a -methylene-hetero atom- linker or an additional hetero atom, directly by aryl, lower alkyl, lower alkenyl, lower alkynyl or heterocyclyl, or a physiologically-acceptable and -cleavable ester or a salt thereof, for use as a pharmaceutical.<br>
The invention further provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising an N-terminal-substituted dipeptide nitrile as defined above as an active ingredient.<br>
The invention also provides a method of treating a patient suffering from or susceptible to a disease or medical condition in which a cathepsin is implicated, comprising administering an effective amount of an N-terminal-substituted dipeptide nitrile as defined above to the patient.<br>
The invention further includes the use of an N-terminal-substituted dipeptide nitrile as defined above for the preparation of a medicament for therapeutic or prophylactic treatment of a disease or medical condition in which a cathepsin is implicated.<br><br>
The dipeptide nitrite of the invention conveniently comprises a-amino acid residues, including both natural and unnatural a-amino acid residues. Herein the "natural a-amino acid residues" denote the 20 amino acids obtainable by translation of RNA according to the genetic code or the corresponding nitrites thereof, as appropriate. "Unnatural a-amino acid residues" are a-amino acids which have a-substituents other than those found in "natural a-amino acid residues". Preferred a-amino acid residues, as the C-terminal amino acid residue of the dipeptide nitrite, are the nitrites of tryptophan, 2-benzyloxymethyl-2-amino-acetic acid, 2,2-dimethyl-2-amino-acetic acid, 2-butyl-2-amino-acetic acid, methionine, leucine, lysine, alanine, phenylalanine, and glycine and derivatives thereof, e.g. as hereinafter described. Preferred amino acid residues as the N-terminal amino acid residue of the dipeptide nitrite are 1-amino-cyclohexanecarboxylic acid, 1-amino-cycloheptanecarboxylic acid, phenylalanine, histidine, tryptophan and leucine and derivatives thereof, e.g. as hereinafter described.<br>
The aryl, lower alkyl, lower alkenyl, lower alkynyl or heterocyclyl substituent (hereinafter referred to as R) is attached to the the N-terminal nitrogen atom of the dipeptide via a peptide linkage, i.e. as R-C(0)-NH-, or via a pseudopeptide linkage. Suitable pseudopeptide linkages include sulphur in place of oxygen and sulphur and phosporous in place of carbon, e.g. as R-C(S)-NH-, R-S(0)-NH-, R-S(0)2-NH- or R-P(0)2-NH and analogues thereof. Additionally the peptide or pseudopeptide linkage between the R substituent and the N-terminal nitrogen atom may comprise an additional hetero atom, e.g. as R-Het-C(0)-NH-, or a -methylene-hetero atom- linker, e.g. as R-Het-CH2-C(0)-NH- or R-CH2-Het-C(0)-NH-, wherein Het is a hetero atom selected from O, N or S, and pseudopeptide containing alternatives thereof, e.g. as defined above. When the linkage between the aryl substituent and the N-terminal nitrogen atom comprises a -methylene-hetero atom- linker, the methylene group and the hetero atom may be optionally further substituted, e.g. as hereinafter described.<br>
The R substituent may be further substituted, e.g. by up to 3 substituents selected from halogen, hydroxy, amino, nitro, optionally substituted CMalkyl (e.g. alkyl substituted by hydroxy, alkyloxy, amino, optionally substituted alkylamino, optionally substituted dialkylamino, aryl or heterocyclyl), CMalkoxy, C2.6alkenyl, CN, trifluoromethyl, trifluoromethoxy, aryl, e.g.phenyl (e.g. phenyl substituted by CN, CF3, halogen, OCH3), aryloxy, e.g. phenoxy (e.g. phenoxy substituted by CN, CF3, halogen, OCH3), benzyloxy or a heterocyclic residue.<br><br>

After mixing, 50 uL of the activated 40 nM solution of recombinant human cathepsin L in assay buffer is then added to the well, yielding a final inhibitor concentration of 10 uM. Enzyme activity is determined by measuring fluorescence of the liberated aminomethylcoumarin at 440 nM using 380 nM excitation of 20 minutes. % Enzyme inhibition is determined by comparison of this activity to that of a solution containing no inhibitor. Compounds are subsequently subjected to a dose response curve analysis to determine IC50 values.<br>

To a microtiter well is added 100 uL of a 20 uM solution of inhibitor is assay buffer. 50 uL of a 700 uM solution of Z-Val-Val-Arg-AMC substrate (Peptides International) is then added. After mixing, 50 uL of a 5.2 nM solution of recombinant human cathepsin S in assay buffer is then added to the well, yielding a final inhibitor concentration of 10 uM. Enzyme activity is determined by measuring fluorescence of the liberated aminomethylcoumarin at 440 nM using 380 nM excitation at 200 minutes. % Enzyme inhibition is determined by comparison of this activity to that of a solution containing no inhibitor.
