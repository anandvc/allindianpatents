DEVICE MANAGEMENT METHOD USING BROADCAST<br>
CHANNEL<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a device management method, and particularly, to a<br>
device management method using a broadcast channel.<br>
Background Art<br>
A Device Management (DM) system is based upon bi-directional protocols and<br>
one-to-one communication protocols for exchanging DM messages with a DM client<br>
(hereinafter, referred to as 'terminal') over a DM session. The DM session should be<br>
set in order for a DM server to transfer a DM command to the terminal. The DM server<br>
sends a DM session notification message to the terminal in a pushing manner thus to<br>
set the DM session. Here, when the terminal having received the message accesses the<br>
DM server to request a DM session connection, the DM session is set between the<br>
terminal and the DM server.<br>
However, in order to set the DM session, it is not required to always perform the<br>
process of sending the DM session notification message to the terminal prior to<br>
performing other processes. For example, when the terminal desires to inform the DM<br>
Server of a particular event internally generated, the terminal requests the DM session<br>
connection from the DM server without receiving the DM session notification message<br>
therefrom. The DM server having received the DM session connection request from<br>
the terminal then checks authentication information related to the terminal and grants<br>
the DM session connection, so as to completely connect the DM session with the<br>
terminal.<br>
Upon setting the DM session between the terminal and the DM server, the terminal<br>
and the DM server exchange DM messages. Accordingly, the DM server can transfer a<br>
DM command to the terminal, whereas the terminal can perform the received DM<br>
command to send the result of the performance to the DM server. The DM server may<br>
check the result of the DM command performance, thus to terminate the DM session or<br>
to send a new DM command to the DM client (i.e., the terminal).<br>
Disclosure of Invention<br>
Technical Problem<br>
Thus, in the related art, the DM server could perform only through the one-to-one<br>
session initiation of a set value of each terminal, variation of the set value thereof or<br>
software upgrading thereof, which causes impossibility of a simultaneous management<br>
for a plurality of terminals.<br><br>
Furthermore, the related art could not perform authentication for data required by a<br>
plurality of terminals via a broadcast channel when transmitting the corresponding<br>
data, resulting in not employing a reliable DM method.<br>
Technical Solution<br>
Therefore, an object of the present invention is to provide a method by which set<br>
values required to simultaneously control a plurality of terminals are programmed and<br>
part of software of the plurality of terminals can be upgraded.<br>

a device in a mobile communications system, the method comprises: receiving first in-<br>
formation from a first server for connecting to a second server;<br>
connecting to the second server using the received first information;<br>
receiving second information from the second server for connecting to a third server<br>
capable of transmitting information on a broadcast channel;<br>
connecting to the third server using the received second information; and receiving<br>
third information from the third server on the broadcast channel.<br>
To achieve these and other advantages and in accordance with the purpose of the<br>
present invention, a Device Management (DM) client may comprise: a file deliver<br>
client (e.g., a kind of reception module) for receiving a DM message from a first server<br>
and receiving from a second server information required for selectively processing the<br>

Mode for the Invention<br>
Description will now be given in detail of the present invention, with reference to<br>
the accompanying drawings.<br>
A DM system according to the present invention may comprise a plurality of<br>
terminals for supporting a broadcasting service, a first server for managing the<br>
terminals so as to allow the plurality of terminals to be provided with the broadcasting<br>
service, and a second server for providing the plurality of terminals with information<br>
required for an access to the first server and authentication thereof.<br>
In one embodiment, the second server may be implemented as a broadcasting<br>
server. In this case, the second server can transmit to a terminal data including in-<br>
formation (or contents) for the connection to the first server. Here, the data may be<br>
provided by a broadcasting server or a typical DM server.<br>
In another embodiment, the second server may be implemented as the typical DM<br>
server. In this case, the second server can broadcast terminal provisioning server in-<br>
formation to the terminal or transmit it to the terminal in an one-to-one manner, the<br>
terminal provisioning server information including information required for the access<br>
to the first server and authentication thereof.<br>
That is, the second server may separately transmit the terminal provisioning server<br>
information containing information required for the access to the first server and the<br>
authentication thereof, or substitute previously-used data by a new DM message which<br>
further includes data for the connection with the first server for transmission.<br>
Further, the present invention can allows the terminal provisioning server to se-<br>
lectively manage terminals in a particular group by including a group ID in data or<br>
terminal provisioning server information, the group ID corresponding to a terminal to<br>
receive data or terminal provisioning server information.<br>
Hereinafter, preferred embodiments of the present invention will be explained with<br>
reference to the accompanying drawings.<br>
Fig. 1 is a view illustrating a construction of a device management system in<br>
accordance with a first embodiment of the present invention. As illustrated in Fig. 1, a<br>
device management system according to the present invention comprises a plurality of<br><br>
terminals 10 for supporting a broadcasting service, a terminal provisioning server 20<br>
for managing the plurality of terminals 10 by broadcasting a DM message to the<br>
plurality of terminals 10, and a broadcasting server 30 for providing a service guide<br>
which includes data required for the connection and authentication of the terminal pro-<br>
visioning server 20.<br>
The broadcasting server 30 transmits to the terminal 10 a service guide which<br>
further includes data containing information related to a method by which the terminal<br>
10 securely receives a broadcasting session that the terminal provisioning server 20<br>
transmits and information related to a method by which the terminal 10 authenticates<br>
and relies on the terminal provisioning server 20.<br>
The terminal 10 may inactively receive a service guide using a broadcast channel,<br>
or actively receive the service guide according to a subscriber's request using an in-<br>
teraction channel. The method using the broadcast channel assumes that the terminal<br>
10 already knows a broadcast channel for broadcasting the service guide and is able to<br>
be previously connected to the corresponding broadcast channel, while the method<br>
using the interaction channel assumes that the terminal 10 already knows an URL<br>
address or the like of the service guide. The terminal 10 can know the URL address of<br>
the service guide by inputting in the terminal 10 an address which is additionally<br>
provided at a time when the user initially subscribes for a service, through web-sites, or<br>
according to programming by a manufacturer.<br>
In order to implement the device management system and method according to the<br>
present invention, the service guide further includes data for the connection to the<br>
terminal provisioning server 20. In general, a service guide denotes a digital content<br>
which is formed based upon a markup language such as XML (extensive Markup<br>
Language). The terminal 10 can automatically parse or interpret the service guide.<br>
In order to embody the device management system and method according to the<br>
present invention, such data as follows are used for the connection to the terminal pro-<br>
visioning server 20. The data can be transferred via a service guide.<br>
1)	Session description information<br>
The session description information denotes information related to a broadcasting<br>
session for broadcasting DM messages by the terminal provisioning server 20. The<br>
session description information includes session address and port information (e.g., IP<br>
address, URL, TCP/UDP port address, etc.), transmission protocols (e.g., RTP,<br>
FLUTE, etc.), codec, transfer rate, and the like.<br>
2)	Connectivity information<br>
The connectivity information denotes several information, such as gateway in-<br>
formation, proxy information, and the like, which are required to access the terminal<br>
provisioning server 20.<br><br>
3)	Certificate<br>
The certificate denotes information for recognizing whether a DM message<br>
broadcast by the terminal provisioning server 20 is reliable. Since the terminal pro-<br>
visioning server 20 also broadcasts an electronic signature for a DM message at the<br>
same time of broadcasting the DM message, the terminal 10 can decrypts the electronic<br>
signature by extracting a public key of the terminal provisioning server 20 from the<br>
certificate.<br>
4)	OCSP (Online Certificate Status Protocol) Response<br>
The OCSP response is used to ensure reliability of the certificate of the terminal<br>
provisioning server 20, the certificate obtained from terminal provisioning server in-<br>
formation. Since the certificate of the terminal provisioning server 20 is issued by a<br>
particular certificate authority, a checking procedure as to whether the certificate is<br>
valid is performed between the certificate authority and the terminal provisioning<br>
server 20. Also, the certificate authority transmits the OCSP response to the terminal<br>
provisioning server 20 such that the terminal provisioning server 20 can ascertain that<br>
the certificate is valid.<br>
5)	Target Group ID<br>
The target group ID denotes information used such that the terminal 10 can se-<br>
lectively receive a message corresponding to the terminal 10 itself among plural DM<br>
messages broadcast by the terminal provisioning server 20. When broadcasting DM<br>
messages, the terminal provisioning server 20 includes the target group ID in the<br>
message and accordingly can transmit a DM message which targets only the terminals<br>
belonging to a specific group. Therefore, when receiving the DM message through a<br>
broadcasting session, the terminal 10 checks a target group ID included in the message.<br>
The terminal then processes the corresponding DM message only when the checked<br>
target group ID is the same as a target group ID obtained in terminal provisioning<br>
server information. For example, the target group ID can be distinguished according to<br>
an area (e.g., a country) to which the corresponding terminal belongs or a service<br>
method of the corresponding terminal (e.g., a terminal adapting DVB-H method, a<br>
terminal adapting MBMS method, etc.).<br>
Fig. 2 is a flowchart illustrating a device management method in accordance with a<br>
first embodiment of the present invention. Explanation will be made of a method by<br>
which a terminal securely receives and authenticates a DM message that a terminal<br>
provisioning server broadcasts by using a service guide provided by a broadcasting<br>
server, with reference to Fig. 2.<br>
The terminal is connected to a broadcasting server by means of a browser to receive<br>
a service guide as information related to a broadcasting service provided by a<br>
broadcasting company (S101). The service guide may further include data which<br><br>
contains session description information, connectivity information, certificate, OCSP<br>
response and a target group ID.<br>
Afterwards, the terminal provisioning server notifies the terminal of a broadcasting<br>
DM session for request (S102). The terminal is connected to the session of the terminal<br>
provisioning server by using the session description information and the connectivity<br>
information included in the service guide (S103). Here, the session description in-<br>
formation includes session address and port information (e.g., IP address, URL, TCP/<br>
UDP port address, etc.), transmission protocols (e.g., RTP, FLUTE, etc.), codec and<br>
transfer rate. The connectivity information includes gateway information and proxy in-<br>
formation.<br>
Upon connecting the broadcasting DM session between the terminal and the<br>
terminal provisioning server, the terminal provisioning server broadcasts a DM<br>
message to the terminal (S104). The terminal provisioning server includes a target<br>
group ID in the DM message, and accordingly allows only a terminal having the group<br>
ID included in the message to receive the corresponding message. Also, the terminal<br>
provisioning server transmits the DM message together with an electronic signature for<br>
the DM message. The electronic signature is generated by a typical electronic signature<br>
generation method. That is, the terminal provisioning server generates a digest value<br>
from the DM message according to a hash algorithm, and encrypts the digest value<br>
using a private key of the terminal provisioning server, so as to generate an electronic<br>
signature.<br>
When receiving the DM message from the terminal provisioning server, the<br>
terminal performs processes as follows (S105).<br>
First, the terminal ascertains a target group ID in the DM message received from the<br>
terminal provisioning server. Here, if the target group ID in the DM message is the<br>
same as that of the terminal, the terminal processes the DM message. If not, the<br>
terminal ignores the message. The terminal can recognize its target group ID by service<br>
guide or terminal provisioning server information downloaded from the broadcasting<br>
server.<br>
If the target group ID Of the terminal is the same as that in the DM message, the<br>
terminal verifies reliability of the DM message. The reliability is verified by the<br>
certificate and OCSP response included in the service guide downloaded from the<br>
broadcasting server. That is, the terminal extracts a public key of the terminal pro-<br>
visioning server from the certificate and decrypts the electronic signature be means of<br>
the extracted public key to thusly obtain a digest value. The terminal then obtains<br>
another digest value from the DM message using the same hash algorithm as that used<br>
by the terminal provisioning server. If the two digest values are the same, the terminal<br>
relies on the terminal provisioning server and the DM message. Also, the reliability of<br><br>
the certificate can be ensured by the OCSP response.<br>
Once verifying the reliability of the DM message, the terminal processes the DM<br>
message. The terminal initializes or changes its set value according to a DM command<br>
included in the DM message. Alternatively, the terminal may install or upgrade its<br>
software according to the DM command included in the DM message. When<br>
completely processing the DM message, the terminal terminates the broadcasting DM<br>
session with the terminal provisioning server (S106).<br>
Although not shown in Fig. 2, it may also be implemented such that the terminal<br>
can compare version information related to a software provided from the terminal pro-<br>
visioning server with version information related to its software having installed<br>
therein, and feedback the result of the comparison to the terminal provisioning server.<br>
Fig. 3 is a view illustrating a construction of a device management system in<br>
accordance with a second embodiment of the present invention. As illustrated in Fig. 2,<br>
a device management system according to the present invention comprises a plurality<br>
of terminals 10 for supporting a broadcasting service, a terminal provisioning server 20<br>
for managing the plurality of terminals 10 by broadcasting a DM command to the<br>
plurality of terminals 10, and a typical DM server 40 for providing a service guide<br>
which is required for the connection between the plurality of terminals 10 and the<br>
terminal provisioning server 20 and authentication of the terminal provisioning server<br>
20.<br>
The terminal 10 can be connected to the terminal provisioning server 40 using<br>
bootstrap information which includes address value and authentication value of the<br>
typical DM server 40. The bootstrap information may remotely be transmitted to the<br>
terminal via the bootstrap server (not shown), preprogrammed in the terminal by a<br>
terminal manufacturer, or be programmed later in the terminal by a user.<br>
The typical DM server 40 transmits to the terminal 10 a service guide which further<br>
includes data related to a method by which the terminal 10 securely receives a<br>
broadcasting session transmitted from the terminal provisioning server 20 and data<br>
related to a method by which the terminal 10 relies on the terminal provisioning server<br>
20.<br>
In order to implement the device management system and method according to the<br>
present invention, the service guide may further include data which contains session<br>
description information, connectivity information, certificate, OCSP response and a<br>
target group ID. Detailed explanation of the data for the connection to the terminal pro-<br>
visioning server which is further included in the service guide has been disclosed in the<br>
first embodiment, and thus it will be omitted.<br>
The terminal 10 is connected to the terminal provisioning server 20 based upon the<br>
service guide received from the typical DM server 40. Thus, the terminal 10 can se-<br><br>
lectively handle a DM message received from the terminal provisioning server 20 and<br>
process the received DM message after verifying its reliability.<br>
Fig. 4 is a flowchart illustrating a device management method in accordance with a<br>
second embodiment of the present invention. Referring to Fig. 4, explanation will be<br>
given of a method by which a terminal securely receives and authenticates a<br>
broadcasting session transmitted by a terminal provisioning server by use of a service<br>
guide provided by a typical DM server.<br>
The terminal receives typical DM information (i.e., bootstrap information) from a<br>
bootstrap server (S201). The typical DM information includes address value and au-<br>
thentication value of a typical DM server which provides a service guide to the<br>
terminal.<br>
Afterwards, when the typical DM sever notifies a session setup (S202), the terminal<br>
ascertains the address value and authentication value provided from the bootstrap<br>
server to be connected to the session of the typical DM server (S203). The terminal<br>
then receives a service guide further including data for the connection to the terminal<br>
provisioning server from the typical DM server via the session, the data containing<br>
session description information, connectivity information, certificate, OCSP (Online<br>
Certificate Status Protocol) response and a target group ID (S204).<br>
The terminal having received the service guide from the typical DM server<br>
terminates the session with the typical DM server (S205). When the terminal pro-<br>
visioning server notifies a broadcasting DM session (S206), the terminal is connected<br>
to the broadcasting DM session by use of session description information and con-<br>
nectivity information included in the service guide (S207).<br>
Procedures after the session connected between the terminal provisioning server<br>
and the terminal are the same as those in the first embodiment, explanation of which<br>
will thusly not be repeated. That is, the second embodiment of the present invention is<br>
different from the first embodiment in the point that the terminal receives from the<br>
typical DM server the service guide including data for the connection to the terminal<br>
provisioning server and receives information for the connection to the typical DM<br>
server from the bootstrap server.<br>
In the flowcharts of the first and second embodiments, only one terminal has been<br>
adapted to explain the device management system according to the present invention.<br>
However, the terminal provisioning server establishes a broadcasting DM session with<br>
a plurality of terminals which have downloaded the service guide to thusly broadcast a<br>
DM message to the plurality of terminal at once.<br>
Fig. 5 illustrates a construction of a device management system in accordance with<br>
a third embodiment of the present invention. As illustrated in Fig. 5, a Device<br>
Management (DM) system according to the present invention comprises a plurality of<br><br>
terminals 10 which support a broadcasting service, a terminal provisioning server 20<br>
for broadcasting a DM command to the plurality of terminals 10 to thusly manage the<br>
plurality of terminals 10, a typical DM server 40 for providing terminal provisioning<br>
server information which the plurality of terminals 10 require to access and au-<br>
thenticate the terminal provisioning server 20, and a bootstrap server 50 for delivering<br>
bootstrap information. Here, the bootstrap server 50 may be configured separately<br>
from the typical DM server 40. Otherwise, the bootstrap server and the typical DM<br>
server may be configured both included in a main server. Thus, the bootstrap server to<br>
be explained hereafter can be substituted by the typical DM server.<br>
The terminal 10 can be connected to the typical DM server 40 using the bootstrap<br>
information which includes address value and authentication value of the typical DM<br>
server 40. The bootstrap information may remotely be transmitted to the terminal via<br>
the bootstrap server 50, preprogrammed in the terminal by a terminal manufacturer, or<br>
be programmed later in the terminal by a user.<br>
The typical DM server 40 transmits to the terminal 10 terminal provisioning server<br>
information which includes information regarding a method for securely receiving by<br>
the terminal 10 a broadcasting session transmitted by the terminal provisioning server<br>
20 and a method for reliably authenticating the terminal provisioning server 20.<br>
In order to embody the DM system and method according to the present invention,<br>
terminal provisioning server information includes session description information, con-<br>
nectivity information, certificate, OCSP (Online Certificate Status Protocol) response<br>
and a target group ID, all of which are the same as those described in the first<br>
embodiment, so as to omit the detailed explanation thereof.<br>
The terminal 10 can be connected to the terminal provisioning server 20 using the<br>
terminal provisioning server information received from the typical DM Server 40. The<br>
terminal 10 can also selectively process the DM message received from the terminal<br>
provisioning server 20, to thus verify reliability of the received DM message. The<br>
connection to the terminal provisioning server 20 is achieved based upon the session<br>
description information and connectivity information. The received DM message are<br>
received based upon the target group ID, and the reliability verification is performed<br>
based upon the certificate and OCSP response.<br>
Fig. 6 is a flowchart illustrating a device management method in accordance with a<br>
third embodiment of the present invention. Here, a terminal can use terminal pro-<br>
visioning server information provided from a typical DM server to enable a safe<br>
reception and authentication for a broadcasting session transmitted by a terminal pro-<br>
visioning server.<br>
The terminal receives typical DM server information (i.e., bootstrap information)<br>
from a bootstrap server (S301). The typical DM server information may include an<br><br>
address value and an authentication value for the typical DM Server which is to<br>
provide the terminal with terminal provisioning server information.<br>
Afterwards, when receiving a notification of a typical DM session from the typical<br>
DM server (S302), the terminal ascertains the address value and authentication value<br>
provided from the bootstrap server and is connected to a typical DM server session<br>
(S303). The terminal also receive the terminal provisioning server information from<br>
the typical DM server via the session, the terminal provisioning server information<br>
including session description information, connectivity information, certificate, OCSP<br>
response and target group ID (S304).<br>
The terminal having received the terminal provisioning server information from the<br>
terminal provisioning server terminates a session with the typical DM server (S305).<br>
When receiving a broadcasting DM session notification from the terminal provisioning<br>
server (S306), the terminal is connected to a session of the terminal provisioning server<br>
by using the session description information and connectivity information included in<br>
the terminal provisioning server information (S307). Here, the session description<br>
information includes session address and port information (e.g., IP address, URL,<br>
TCP/UDP port address, etc.), transmission protocols (e.g., RTP, FLUTE, etc.), codec<br>
and transfer rate, and the connectivity information includes gateway information and<br>
proxy information.<br>
Upon connecting the broadcasting DM session between the terminal and the<br>
terminal provisioning server, the terminal provisioning server broadcasts a DM<br>
message to the terminal (S308). The terminal provisioning server includes a target<br>
group ID in the DM message, and accordingly allows only a terminal having the group<br>
ID included in the message to receive the corresponding message. Also, the terminal<br>
provisioning server transmits the DM message together with an electronic signature for<br>
the DM message. The electronic signature is generated by a typical electronic signature<br>
generation method. That is, the terminal provisioning server generates a digest value<br>
from the DM message according to a hash algorithm, and encrypts the digest value<br>
using a private key of the terminal provisioning server, so as to generate an electronic<br>
signature.<br>
When receiving the DM message from the terminal provisioning server, the<br>
terminal performs processes as follows (S309).<br>
First, the terminal ascertains a target group ID in the DM message received from the<br>
terminal provisioning server. Here, if the target group ID in the DM message is the<br>
same as that of the terminal, the terminal processes the DM message. If not, the<br>
terminal ignores the message. The terminal can recognize its target group ID by<br>
terminal provisioning server information downloaded from the typical DM server.<br>
If the target group ID Of the terminal is the same as that in the DM message, the<br><br>
terminal verifies reliability of the DM message. The reliability is verified by the<br>
certificate and OCSP response included in the terminal provisioning server information<br>
downloaded from the terminal provisioning server. That is, the terminal extracts a<br>
public key of the terminal provisioning server from the certificate and decrypts the<br>
electronic signature be means of the extracted public key to thusly obtain a digest<br>
value. The terminal then obtains another digest value from the DM message using the<br>
same hash algorithm as that used by the terminal provisioning server. If the two digest<br>
values are the same, the terminal relies on the terminal provisioning server and the DM<br>
message. Also, the reliability of the certificate can be ensured by the OCSP response.<br>
Once verifying the reliability of the DM message, the terminal processes the DM<br>
message. The terminal initializes or changes its set value according to a DM command<br>
included in the DM message. Alternatively, the terminal may install or upgrade its<br>
software according to the DM command included in the DM message. When<br>
completely processing the DM message, the terminal terminates the broadcasting DM<br>
session with the terminal provisioning server (S310).<br>
Although not shown in Fig. 2, it may also be implemented such that the terminal<br>
can compare version information related to a software provided from the terminal pro-<br>
visioning server with version information related to its software having installed<br>
therein, and feedback the result of the comparison to the terminal provisioning server.<br>
Concerning the flowchart in the embodiment, the DM method according to the<br>
present invention which can be implemented only by one terminal has been explained.<br>
However, the terminal provisioning server connects the broadcasting DM session with<br>
a plurality of terminals which have downloaded the terminal provisioning server in-<br>
formation, thus to enable a broadcasting of the DM message to the plurality of<br>
terminals at once.<br>
Fig. 7 illustrates a device management client 100 according to the present invention.<br>
As illustrated in Fig. 7, the DM client 100 comprises a reception module(or receiver)<br>
101, a checking module 102, an authentication module 103, a processor 104 and a<br>
transmission module 105.<br>
The reception module 101 receives terminal provisioning server information<br>
transmitted by a broadcasting server or typical DM server, and receives a DM message<br>
transmitted by a terminal provisioning server. Here, the terminal provisioning server<br>
information may include session description information, connectivity information,<br>
certificate, OCSP response and target group ID. Detailed explanation with respect to<br>
each item included in the terminal provisioning server information has been provided<br>
above in detail so as not to be repeated.<br>
The reception module 101 first receives bootstrap information or terminal pro-<br>
visioning server information. The reception module 101 can be connected to a session<br><br>
of the terminal provisioning server using the session description information and con-<br>
nectivity information included in the terminal provisioning server information. The<br>
reception module 101 then receives the DM message via the connected session with<br>
the terminal provisioning server.<br>
The checking module 102 checks whether a group ID of the terminal (i.e., the target<br>
group ID of the DM client) included in the terminal provisioning server information is<br>
the same as the group ID included in the DM message. This process may not be<br>
performed if the group ID is not included in the terminal provisioning server in-<br>
formation.<br>
The processor 104 controls the reception module 101, the checking module 102 and<br>
the authentication module 103. If it is determined by the checking module 102 that the<br>
group ID included in the DM message is the same as the group ID included in the<br>
terminal provisioning server information, the processor 104 delivers the DM message<br>
to the authentication module 103. If not, the processor 104 does not process the DM<br>
message.<br>
The authentication module 103 can verify reliability of the DM message using the<br>
certificate and OCSP response provided by being included in the terminal provisioning<br>
server information. The DM message is received together with an electronic signature.<br>
Accordingly, the authentication module 103 extracts a public key of the terminal pro-<br>
visioning server from the certificate and decrypts the electronic signature by means of<br>
the extracted public key, thus to obtain a digest value. Then, another digest value is<br>
obtained from the DM message by using the same hash algorithm as that used by the<br>
terminal provisioning server. If both the digest values are the same, the terminal pro-<br>
visioning server and the DM message are reliable.<br>
The processor 104 processes only the DM message with reliability verified by the<br>
authentication module 103. That is, the processor 104 performs a DM command<br>
included in the DM message. For example, the processor can upgrade software of the<br>
DM client or change a set value according to the DM command.<br>
The transmission module 105 includes the most basic function of communications<br>
terminals. The transmission module 105 denotes a module for transmitting information<br>
toward a server when setting the session between the server and the terminal as shown<br>
in the flowchart of Fig. 2. Transmission of information from the server to the terminal<br>
upon setting the session is obvious to those skilled in the art, explanation of which will<br>
thusly be omitted.<br>
As described above, the present invention can effectively adapt a reliable DM<br>
method capable of simultaneously initializing a plurality of terminals, changing set<br>
values of the plurality of terminals, or upgrading part of software of the plurality of<br>
terminals by allowing transmission of set values needed to the plurality of terminals<br><br>
via a broadcast channel and allowing authentication for message received.<br>
Particularly, by employing a list of target group IDs, one terminal provisioning<br>
server can effectively be operated to transmit different DM commands according to<br>
terminals each of which adapts different operating methods or is used in different<br>
countries, or other conditions.<br>

the spirit or essential characteristics thereof, it should also be understood that the<br>
