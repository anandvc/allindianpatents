This invention includes the hydrates and the pharmaceutically acceptable salts of<br>
the compounds of formula I. A compound of this invention can possess a sufficiently<br>
basic functional group which can react with any of a number of inorganic and organic<br>
acids, to form a pharmaceutically acceptable salt.<br>
The term "pharmaceutically acceptable salt" as used herein, refers to salts of the<br>
compounds of formula I which are substantially non-toxic to living organisms. Typical<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable salts include those salts prepared by reaction of the<br>
compounds of the present invention with a pharmaceutically acceptable mineral or<br>
organic acid. Such salts are also known as acid addition salts.<br>
Acids commonly employed to form acid addition salts are inorganic acids such as<br>
hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, hydroiodic acid, sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid, and<br>
the like, and organic acids such as p-toluenesulfonic, methanesulfonic acid, oxalic acid, p-<br>
bromophenylsulfonic acid, carbonic acid, succinic acid, citric acid, benzoic acid, acetic<br>
acid, trifluoroacetic acid, and the like. Examples of such pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
salts are the sulfate, pyrosulfate, bisulfate, sulfite, bisulfite, phosphate,<br>
monohydrogenphosphate, dihydrogenphosphate, metaphosphate, pyrophosphate, bromide,<br>
iodide, acetate, trifluoroacetate, propionate, decanoate, caprylate, acrylate, formate,<br>
hydrochloride, dihydrochloride, isobutyrate, caproate, heptanoate, propiolate, oxalate,<br>
malonate, succinate, suberate, sebacate, fumarate, maleate, butyne-l,4-dioate, hexyne-1,6-<br>
dioate, benzoate, chlorobenzoate, methylbenzoate, hydroxybenzoate, methoxybenzoate,<br>
phthalate, xylenesulfonate, phenylacetate, phenylpropionate, phenylbutyrate, citrate,<br>
lactate, a-hydroxybutyrate, glycolate, tartrate, methanesulfonate, propanesulfonate,<br>
naphthalene-1-sulfonate, napththalene-2-sulfonate, mandelate and the like. Preferred<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts are those formed with mineral acids such<br>
as hydrochloric acid and hydrobromic acid, and those formed with organic acids such as<br>
maleic acid, oxalic acid, triofluoroacetic acid, and methanesulfonic acid.<br>
It should be recognized that the particular counterion forming a part of any salt of<br>
this invention is usually not of a critical nature, so long as the salt as a whole is<br>
pharmacologically acceptable and as long as the counterion does not contribute undesired<br>
qualities to the salt as a whole. It is further understood that such salts may exist as a<br>
hydrate.<br>
As used herein, the terra "stereoisomer" refers to a compound made up of the same<br>
atoms bonded by the same bonds but having different three-dimensional structures which<br>
are not interchangeable. The three-dimensional structures are called configurations. As<br>
used herein, the term "enantiomer" refers to two stereoisomers whose molecules are<br>
nonsuperimposable mirror images of one another. The term "chiral center" refers to a<br>
carbon atom to which four different groups are attached. As used herein, the term<br>
"diastereomers" refers to stereoisomers which are not enantiomers. In addition, two<br>
diastereomers winch have a different configuration at only one chiral center are referred to<br>
herein as "epimers". The terms "racemate", "racemic mixture" or "racemic modification"<br>
refer to a mixture of equal parts of enantiomers.<br>
The term "enantiomeric enrichment" as used herein refers to the increase in the<br>
amount of one enantiomer as compared to the other. A convenient method of expressing<br>
the enantiomeric enrichment achieved is the concept of enantiomeric excess, or "ee",<br>
which is found using the following equation:<br><br>
wherein E1 is the amount of the first enantiomer and E2 is the amount of the second<br>
enantiomer. Thus, if the initial ratio of the two enantiomers is 50:50, such as is present in<br>
a racemic mixture, and an enantiomeric enrichment sufficient to produce a final ratio of<br>
50:30 is achieved, the ee with respect to the first enantiomer is 25%. However, if the final<br>
ratio is 90:10, the ee with respect to the first enantiomer is 80%. An ee of greater than<br>
90% is preferred, an ee of greater than 95% is most preferred and an ee of greater than<br>
99% is most especially preferred. Enantiomeric enrichment is readily determined by one<br>
of ordinary skill in the art using standard techniques and procedures, such as gas or high<br>
performance liquid chromatography with a chiral column. Choice of the appropriate<br>
chiral column, eluent and conditions necessary to effect separation of the enantiomeric<br>
pair is well within the knowledge of one of ordinary skill in the art. In addition, the<br>
enantiomers of compounds of formula I can be resolved by one of ordinary skill in the art<br>
using standard techniques well known in the art, such as those described by J. Jacques, et<br>
al., "Enantiomers, Racemates, and Resolutions", John Wiley and Sons, Inc., 1981.<br>
The compounds of the present invention have one or more chiral centers and may<br>
exist in a variety of stereoisomeric configurations. As a consequence of these chiral<br>
centers, the compounds of the present invention occur as racemates, mixtures of<br>
enantiomers and as individual enantiomers, as well as diastereomers and mixtures of<br>
diastereomers. All such racemates, enantiomers, and diastereomers are within the scope<br>
of the present invention.<br>
The terms "R" and "S" are used herein as commonly used in organic chemistry to<br>
denote specific configuration of a chiral center. The term "R" (rectus) refers to that<br>
configuration of a chiral center with a clockwise relationship of group priorities (highest<br>
to second lowest) when viewed along the bond toward the lowest priority group. The<br>
term "S" (sinister) refers to that configuration of a chiral center with a counterclockwise<br>
relationship of group priorities (highest to second lowest) when viewed along the bond<br>
toward the lowest priority group. The priority of groups is based upon their atomic<br>
number (in order of decreasing atomic number). A partial list of priorities and a<br>
discussion of stereochemistry is contained in "Nomenclature of Organic Compounds:<br>
Principles and Practice", (J.H. Fletcher, et al., eds., 1974) at pages 103-120.<br>
The specific stereoisomers and enantiomers of compounds of formula (I) can be<br>
prepared by one of ordinary skill in the art utilizing well known techniques and processes,<br>
such as those disclosed by Eliel and Wilen, "Stereochemistry of Organic Compounds",<br>
John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., 1994, Chapter 7, Separation of Stereoisomers. Resolution.<br>
Racemization, and by Collet and Wilen, "Enantiomers, Racemates, and Resolutions",<br>
John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., 1981. For example, the specific stereoisomers and enantiomers<br>
can be prepared by stereospecific syntheses using enantiomerically and geometrically<br>
pure, or enantiomerically or geometrically enriched starting materials. In addition, the<br>
specific stereoisomers and enantiomers can be resolved and recovered by techniques such<br>
as chromatography on chiral stationary phases, enzymatic resolution or fractional<br>
recrystallization of addition salts formed by reagents used for that purpose.<br>
The compounds of formula I can be prepared by techniques and procedures readily<br>
available to one of ordinary skill in the art. More specifically, compounds of Formula I<br>
can be chemically prepared, for example, by following the synthetic routes set forth in the<br>
Scheme below. However, the following discussion is not intended to be limiting to the<br>
scope of the present invention in any way. For example, the specific synthetic steps for<br>
the route described herein may be combined in different ways to prepare the compounds<br>
of Formula I. All substituents, unless otherwise indicated, are as previously defined.<br>
The reagents and starting materials are readily available to one of ordinary skill in the art.<br>
For example, certain starting materials can be prepared by one of ordinary skill in the art<br>
following procedures disclosed in United States Patents Nos. 5,356,902 (issued October<br>
18, 1994) and 5,446,051 (issued August 29, 1995) and 5,670,516 (issued September 23,<br>
1997) the entire contents, all of which, are herein incorporated by reference. Other<br>
necessary reagents and starting materials for the below procedures may be made by<br>
procedures which are selected from standard techniques of organic and heterocyclic<br>
chemistry, techniques which are analogous to the syntheses of known structurally similar<br>
compounds, and the procedures described in the Examples, including any novel<br>
procedures.<br>
In Scheme I, compound A is esterified to provide the monoester of formula I under<br>
standard conditions well known in the art. For example, compound A is dissolved in a<br>
suitable organic solvent and treated with a suitable acid, such as hydrochloric acid.<br>
Examples of suitable organic solvents include, methyl alcohol, ethyl alcohol, propyl<br>
alcohol, isopropyl alcohol, n-butyl alcohol, isobutyl alcohol, t-butyl alcohol, pentyl<br>
alcohol, isopentyl alcohol, hexyl alcohol, 3-methylpentyl alcohol, 2-ethylbutyl alcohol, n-<br>
heptyl alcohol, n-octyl alcohol, decyl alcohol and the like. The reaction is heated at about<br>
40°C to about 60°C for about 4 hours to about 16 hours. The product is then isolated and<br>
purified using techniques well known to one of ordinary skill in the art, such as extraction<br>
techniques and chromatography.<br>
For example, the above reaction is cooled, diluted with a suitable organic solvent,<br>
such as ethyl acetate, washed with saturated sodium bicarbonate, brine, dried over<br>
anhydrous magnesium sulfate, filtered and concentrated under vacuum to provide the<br>
compound of formula I. This material may be further purified by flash chromatography<br>
on silica gel with a suitable eluent such as ethyl acetate/hexane.<br>
Alternatively, compound A is dissolved in a suitable organic solvent and treated<br>

The present invention further provides a method of antagonizing the AMPA or<br>
GluR5 receptors, of the larger class of excitatory amino acid receptors, which comprises<br>
administering to a patient an effective amount of a compound of formula I. The excessive<br>
or inappropriate stimulation of excitatory amino acid receptors leads to neuronal cell<br>
damage or loss by way of a mechanism known as excitotoxicity. This process has been<br>
suggested to mediate neuronal degeneration in a variety of neurological disorders and<br>
conditions. The medical consequences of such neuronal degeneration makes the<br>
abatement of these degenerative neurological processes an important therapeutic goal.<br>
For instance, excitatory amino acid receptor excitotoxicity has been implicated in the<br>
pathophysiology of numerous neurological disorders, including the etiology of cerebral<br>
deficits subsequent to cardiac bypass surgery and grafting, stroke, cerebral ischemia,<br>
spinal cord lesions resulting from trauma or inflammation, perinatal hypoxia, cardiac<br>
arrest, and hypoglycemic neuronal damage. In addition, excitotoxicity has been<br>
implicated in chronic neurodegenerative conditions including Alzheimer's Disease,<br>
Huntington's Chorea, inherited ataxias, AIDS-induced dementia, amyotrophic lateral<br>
sclerosis, idiopathic and drug-induced Parkinson's Disease, as well as ocular damage and<br>
retinopathy. Other neurological disorders implicated with excitotoxicity and/or glutamate<br>
dysfunction include muscular spasticity including tremors, drug tolerance and withdrawal,<br>
brain edema, convulsive disorders including epilepsy, depression, anxiety and anxiety<br>
related disorders such as post-traumatic stress syndrome, tardive dyskinesia, and<br>
psychosis related to depression, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, mania, and drug<br>
intoxication or addiction (see generally United States Patent No. 5,446,051 and<br>
5,670,516). Excitatory amino acid receptor antagonists may also be useful as analgesic<br>
agents and for treating or preventing various forms of headache, including cluster<br>
headache, tension-type headache, and chronic daily headache. In addition, published<br>
International Patent application WO 98/45720 reports that excitatory amino acid receptor<br>
excitotoxicity participates in the etiology of acute and chronic pain states including severe<br>
pain, intractable pain, neuropathic pain, post-traumatic pain.<br>
It is also known that trigeminal ganglia, and their associated nerve pathways, are<br>
associated with painful sensations of the head and face such as headache and, in<br>
particular, migraine. Moskowitz (Cephalalgia, 12, 5-7, (1992) proposed that unknown<br>
triggers stimulate the trigeminal ganglia which in turn innervate vasculature within<br>
cephalic tissue, giving rise to the release of vasoactive neuropeptides from axons<br>
innervating the vasculature. These neuropeptides initiate a series of events leading to<br>
neurogenic inflammation of the meninges, a consequence of which is pain. This<br>
neurogenic inflammation is blocked by sumatriptan at doses similar to those required to<br>
treat acute migraine in humans. However, such doses of sumatriptan are associated with<br>
contraindications as a result of sumatriptan's attendant vasoconstrictive properties.(see<br>
MacIntyre, P.D., et al., British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology, 34, 541-546 (1992);<br>
Chester, A.H., et al, Cardiovascular Research, 24, 932-937 (1990); Conner, H.E., et al.,<br>
European Journal of Pharmacology, 161, 91-94 (1990)). Recently, it has been reported<br>
that all five members of the kainate subtype of ionotropic glutamate receptors are<br>
expressed on rat trigeminal ganglion neurons, and in particular, high levels of GluR5 and<br>
KA2 have been observed. (Sahara et al., The Journal of Neuroscience, 17(17), 6611<br>
(1997)). As such, migraine presents yet another neurological disorder which may be<br>
implicated with glutamate receptor excitotoxicity.<br>
The use of a neuroprotective agent, such as an excitatory amino acid receptor<br>
antagonist, is believed to be useful in treating or preventing all of the aforementioned<br>
disorders and/or reducing the amount of neurological damage associated with these<br>
disorders. For example, studies have shown that AMPA receptor antagonists are<br>
neuroprotective in focal and global ischemia models. The competitive AMPA receptor<br>
antagonist NBQX (2,3-dihydroxy-6-nitro-7-sulfamoylbenzo[f]quinoxaline) has been<br>
reported effective in preventing global and focal ischemic damage. Sheardown et al.,<br>
Science, 247, 571 (1900); Buchan et al, Neuroreport, 2, 473 (1991); LePeillet et al.,<br>
Brain Research, 571, 115 (1992). The noncompetitive AMPA receptor antagonists GKYI<br>
52466 has been shown to be an effective neuroprotective agent in rat global ischemia<br>
models. LaPeillet et al., Brain Research, 571, 115 (1992). European Patent Application<br>
Publication No. 590789A1 and United States Patents No. 5,446,051 and 5,670,516<br>
disclose that certain decahydroisoquinoline derivative compounds are AMPA receptor<br>
antagonists and, as such, are useful in the treatment of a multitude of disorders conditions,<br>
including pain and migraine headache. WO 98/45270 discloses that certain<br>
decahydroisoquinoline derivative compounds are selective antagonists of the iGluR5<br>
receptor and are useful for the treatment of various types of pain, including; severe,<br>
chronic, intractable, and neuropathic pain.<br>
As such, the compounds of the present invention are believed to be useful for<br>
treating neurological disorders, as discussed above. Such compounds could address a<br>
long felt need for safe and effective treatments for neruological disorders, without<br>
attending side effects. Thus, the present invention further provides a method for the<br>
treatment of a neurological disorder, which comprises administering to a patient in need<br>
thereof, an effective amount of a compound of formula I. More particularly, the present<br>
invention further provides a method for the treatment of pain or migraine, which<br>
comprises administering to a patient in need thereof, an effective amount of a compound<br>
of formula I. The treatment of neurological disorders and neurodegenerative diseases is<br>
hereby furthered.<br>
As used herein the term "patient" refers to a mammal, such a mouse, guinea pig,<br>
rat, dog, monkey, or human. It is understood that the preferred patient is a human.<br>
The term "treating" (or "treat") as used herein includes its generally accepted<br>
meaning which encompasses prohibiting, preventing, restraining, and slowing, stopping,<br>
or reversing progression, severity, of a resultant symptom. As such, the methods of this<br>
invention encompass both therapeutic and prophylactic administration.<br>
As used herein the term "effective amount" refers to the amount or dose of the<br>
compound, upon single or multiple dose administration to the patient, which provides the<br>
desired effect in the patient under diagnosis or treatment.<br>
An effective amount can be readily determined by the attending diagnostician, as<br>
one skilled in the art, by the use of known techniques and by observing results obtained<br>
under analogous circumstances. In determining the effective amount or dose of<br>
compound administered, a number of factors are considered by the attending<br>
diagnostician, including, but not limited to: the species of mammal; its size, age, and<br>
general health; the specific disease involved; the degree of or involvement or the severity<br>
of the disease; the response of the individual patient; the particular compound<br>
administered; the mode of administration; the bioavailability characteristics of the<br>
preparation administered; the dose regimen selected; the use of concomitant medication;<br>
and other relevant circumstances.<br>
A typical daily dose will contain from about 0.01 mg/kg to about 100 mg/kg of the<br>
active compound of this invention. Preferably, daily doses will be about 0.05 mg/kg to<br>
about 50 mg/kg, more preferably from about 0.1 mg/kg to about 25 mg/kg.<br>
In effecting treatment of a patient afflicted with a condition, disease or disorder<br>
described above, a compound of formula (I) can be administered in any form or mode<br>
which makes the parent monoacid compound bioavailable in effective amounts, including<br>
oral and parenteral routes. For example, compounds of formula (I) can be administered<br>
orally, subcutaneously, intramuscularly, intravenously, transdermally, intranasally,<br>
rectally, buccally, and the like. Alternatively, the compound may be administered by<br>
continuous infusion. Oral administration is generally preferred. One skilled in the art of<br>
preparing formulations can readily select the proper form and mode of administration<br>
depending upon the particular characteristics of the compound selected, the disease state<br>
to be treated, the stage of the disease, and other relevant circumstances.<br>
It will be understood by the skilled reader that all of the compounds used in the<br>
present invention are capable of forming salts, and that the salt forms of pharmaceuticals<br>
are commonly used, often because they are more readily crystallized and purified than are<br>
the free bases. In all cases, the use of the pharmaceuticals described above as salts is<br>
contemplated in the description herein, and often is preferred, and the pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable salts of all of the compounds are included in the names of them.<br>
According to another aspect, the present invention provides a pharmaceutical<br>
composition, which comprises a compound of formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
salt thereof as defined hereinabove and a pharmaceutically acceptable diluent or carrier.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions are prepared by known procedures using well-<br>
known and readily available ingredients. In making the compositions of the present<br>
invention, the active ingredient will usually be mixed with a carrier, or diluted by a<br>
carrier, or enclosed within a carrier, and may be in the form of a capsule, sachet, paper, or<br>
other container. When the carrier serves as a diluent, it may be a solid, semi-solid, or<br>
liquid material which acts as a vehicle, excipient, or medium for the active ingredient.<br>
The compositions can be in the form of tablets, pills, powders, lozenges, sachets, cachets,<br>
elixirs, suspensions, emulsions, solutions, syrups, aerosols, ointments containing, for<br>
example, up to 10% by weight of active compound, soft and hard gelatin capsules,<br>
suppositories, sterile injectable solutions, and sterile packaged powders.<br>
Some examples of suitable carriers, excipients, and diluents include lactose,<br>
dextrose, sucrose, sorbitol, mannitol, starches, gum, acacia, calcium phosphate, alginates,<br>
tragcanth, gelatin, calcium silicate, micro-crystalline cellulose, polyvinylpyrrolidone,<br>
cellulose, water syrup, methyl cellulose, methyl and propyl hydroxybenzoates, talc,<br>
magnesium stearate, and mineral oil. The formulations can additionally include<br>
lubricating agents, wetting agents, emulsifying and suspending agents, preserving agents,<br>
sweetening agents, or flavoring agents. Compositions of the invention may be formulated<br>
so as to provide quick, sustained, or delayed release of the active ingredient after<br>
administration to the patient by employing procedures well known in the art.<br>
The compositions are preferably formulated in a unit dosage form, each dosage<br>
containing from about 1 mg to about 500 mg, more preferably about 5 mg to about 300<br>
mg (for example 25 mg) of the active ingredient. The term "unit dosage form" refers to a<br>
physically discrete unit suitable as unitary dosages for human subjects and other<br>
mammals, each unit containing a predetermined quantity of active material calculated to<br>
produce the desired therapeutic effect, in association with a suitable pharmaceutical<br>
carrier, diluent, or excipient. The following formulation examples are illustrative only<br>
