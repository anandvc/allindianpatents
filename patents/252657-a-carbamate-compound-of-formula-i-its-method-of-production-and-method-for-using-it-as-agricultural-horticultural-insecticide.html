(Formula Removed)<br>
l-(i)  Formula (10) -&gt; Formula (12)<br>
A m-nitrobenzoyl chloride derivative represented by formula (10) is reacted with an aromatic amine derivative represented by formula (11) in an appropriate solvent to produce a benzamide derivative represented by formula (12).  In this step, an appropriate base can also be used.  As the solvent, any solvent which does not significantly inhibit the progress of reaction can be used.  Examples of the solvent include aromatic hydrocarbons such as benzene, toluene, and xylene; halogenated hydrocarbons<br>
such as dichloromethane, chloroform, and carbon tetrachloride; chained or cyclic ethers such as diethyl ether, dioxane, tetrahydrofuran, and 1,2-dimethoxyethane; esters such as ethyl acetate and butyl acetate; ketones such as acetone, methyl isobutyl ketone, and cyclohexanone; amides such as dimethylformamide and dimethylacetamide; nitriles such as acetonitrile; and inert solvents such as 1,3-dimethyl-2-imidazolidinone.  These solvents can be used alone or in a mixture of two ore more kinds.  Examples of the base include organic bases such as triethylamine, tri-n-butylamine, pyridine, and 4-dimethylaminopyridine; alkali metal hydroxides such as sodium hydroxide and potassium hydroxide; carbonates such as sodium hydrogen carbonate and potassium carbonate; phosphates such as dipotassium hydrogen phosphate and trisodium phosphate; alkali metal hydrides such as sodium hydride; and alkali metal alcoholates such as sodium methoxide and sodium ethoxide.

As a result, at a concentration of 1000 ppm, a mortality of 70% or more was exhibited by Compounds Nos. 108, 127, 184, 196, 197, 205, 209, 212, 215, 1321, 1361, 1368, 1408, 1411, 1416, 1435, 1455, 1458, 1463, 1958, 1959, and 1968.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
