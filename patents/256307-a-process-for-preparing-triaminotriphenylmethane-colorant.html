Description<br>
Blue dye with particularly high purity and positive triboelectric control effect<br>
The present invention is situated within the field of triphenylmethane colorants.<br>
Triphenylmethane colorants are of great industrial importance in the production of<br>
blue printing inks.<br>
US 3,671,553 describes a specific process for preparing particularly pure<br>
triphenylmethane dyes. Nevertheless the products thus prepared contain up to 1%<br>
anilines (by HPLC) as residue from the synthesis.<br>
US 5,061,585 describes a specifically substituted triaminotriphenylmethane colorant<br>
as a positive charge control agent for electrophotographic toners and developers.<br>
This compound, however, has a relatively high level of environmentally critical<br>
impurities, particularly aniline and chlorobenzene. Aniline and chlorobenzene are<br>
reactants for the synthesis of the target substance which, as a result of incomplete<br>
reaction or excesses, are entrained as impurities throughout the production<br>
operation into the end product. For instance, the aniline content, measured by<br>
means of gas chromatography in headspace tubes (GC-HS) after thermal exposure<br>
at 120°C for 1 hour, is between about 1000 and 2500 ppm, while by means of high-<br>
performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) on samples fully dissolved in methanol<br>
about 9000-10 000 ppm of aniline are measured. In the case of the compound<br>
described a distinct chlorobenzene peak is also detected. Triphenylmethane<br>
colorants having an aniline content of below 2000 ppm (by HPLC) have not been<br>
disclosed to date.<br>
It is therefore an object of the invention to provide triaminotriphenylmethane<br>
colorants having a primary aromatic amine - in particular, aniline and m-toluidine -<br>
content of below 2000 ppm.<br><br>
A further object is to provide a colorant having a significantly reduced level of.<br>
inorganic cations and anions, such as Na+, K+, Al3+, SO42- or CI-, for example. This<br>
reduced amount of inorganic ions can be measured, for example, by means of<br>
conductivity on an aqueous suspension of the product.<br>
It has been found that this object can be achieved by a new kind of purifying and<br>
isolating process, as described below.<br>
The invention provides a process for preparing a compound of the formula (1)<br><br>
by Friedel-Crafts alkylation of p-chlorobenzotrichloride with chlorobenzene,<br>
substitution of the aromatically bonded chlorine by aniline and m-toluidine, alkaline<br>
hydrolysis to give the dye base, and precipitation as the dyebase sulfate of the<br>
formula (1), which comprises<br>
a)	taking up the dyebase sulfate in water and subjecting it to a first steam<br>
distillation, then filtering it and drying, where appropriate, at from 50 to 180°C,<br>
b)	adding water to the presscake or pasting the dyebase sulfate, where it has<br>
been dried, with water,<br>
c)	subjecting it to a further steam distillation and filtration<br>
d)	and to drying at from 50 to 180°C.<br>
The invention further provides a compound of the formula (1) characterized by a<br>
primary aromatic amine - in particular, aniline and m-toluidine - content of less than<br><br>
2000 ppm, preferably less than 1000 ppm, in particular less than 500 ppm; as.<br>
determined by HPLC. For this purpose the compound of the formula (1) is dried at<br>
120°C for about 1 hour, dissolved in methanol, and analyzed by HPLC (eluent:<br>
methanol/water; column: RP-select B).<br>
Additionally in the compound of the invention the said amine content, measured by<br>
means of GC-HS following thermal exposure at 120°C for.1 hour, is below 800 ppm,<br>
preferably below 500 ppm, more preferably below 300 ppm.<br>
Whereas the HPLC method detects the entire amine content of the substance<br>
(amine + amine sulfate), the GC-HS methods detects only the volatile fraction of the<br>
compounds in the gas space over the substance.<br>
Furthermore, the chlorobenzene content after conditioning at 120°C for 1 hour, as<br>
measured by means of GC-HS, is below 500 ppm, preferably below 150 ppm, more<br>
preferably below 70 ppm.<br>
Moreover, the conductivity of a 5% aqueous dispersion of the product of the<br>
invention is between 0.001 and 1.5 mS/cm, preferably between 0.01 and 1 mS/cm.<br>
The process of the invention is preferably conducted as follows: First of all p-<br>
chlorobenzotrichloride is reacted in a Friedel-Crafts reaction with chlorobenzene<br>
under the catalytic effect of aluminum trichloride. The aromatically bonded chlorine<br>
in the Friedel-Crafts product is then substituted by aniline and m-toluidine in solution<br>
in chlorobenzene. In the next step the resulting intermediate is hydrolyzed with<br>
aqueous sodium hydroxide solution to give the free "dye base". Thereafter the<br>
desired product is precipitated in the form of the "dyebase sulfate" from the<br>
chlorobenzene solution with aqueous sulfuric acid solution in a precipitation cascade<br>
with downstream filtration. The precipitated product is subsequently taken up in<br>
water, which is at a temperature of 70 to 100°C, preferably at 90 to 100°C, and<br>
subjected to subsequent steam distillation and also to a downstream aqueous<br>
filtration in order to remove the water-soluble aniline sulfate. The product can then<br>
be dried in a drying operation, in for example a rack dryer, forced air dryer or paddle<br>
dryer, or a combination thereof, at a temperature of from 50 to 180°C, preferably<br>
from 80 to 160°C, more preferably from 90 to 150°C, where appropriate under<br><br>
reduced pressure of down to 10-4 bar, at for example 50 to 100 mbar. Following<br>
filtration the product presscake is admixed with water in a ratio of from 1:1 to 1:1000,<br>
preferably from 1:2 to 1:100, more preferably from 1:2 to 1:50. Alternatively, if<br>
drying has been carried out, the dried product thus obtained is pasted up in the<br>
proportions described and again is subjected to a steam distillation and filtration.<br>
Drying can then be repeated under the same conditions as described above. The<br>
additional step of admixing the presscake with water or the step of pasting up the<br>
dried material with water, followed by the steam distillation and filtration, can be<br>
repeated from 1 to 10 times, preferably from two to four times, with the drying of the<br>
presscake being carried out as described above in every case after the final<br>
repetition.<br>
In order to raise the efficiency of the removal of the impurities from the product it<br>
may be sensible to carry out wet grinding of the aqueous product suspension before<br>
the first steam distillation and/or before one or more further steam distillations. This<br>
wet grinding operation can be carried out, for example, by means of a toothed disk<br>
mill, pinned disk mill or bead mill, giving a particle size d50 of from 5 nm to 1 mm,<br>
preferably from 1 µm to 600 µm, for the ground particles in the suspension. This<br>
step increases the access of the water to the impurities in the enclosed particles and<br>
so makes the removal by means of steam distillation and aqueous filtration more<br>
efficient.<br>
The dried dyebase sulfate can subsequently be adjusted to a desired particle size by<br>
grinding. Examples of advantageous apparatus here include air jet mills, cutting<br>
mills, hammer mills, bead mills, and impact mills. The target particle size,<br>
determined by means of evaluation under a light microscope or by laser light<br>
diffraction and defined by the d50 value, is appropriately between 0.01 µm and<br>
1000 µm, preferably between 0.1 and 500 urn, and very preferably between 0.5 and<br>
400 µm. It is particularly advantageous if the grinding operation results in a narrow<br>
particle size. Preference is given to a range ∆ (d95-d50) of less than 500 µm, in<br>
particular less than 400 µm.<br>
The compound of the invention contains predominantly crystalline fractions but also<br>
includes amorphous fractions.<br><br>
The product of the invention can be used for pigmenting high molecular mass<br>
organic materials of natural or synthetic origin: for example plastics, resins, paints,<br>
paints, or electrophotographic toners and developers, and also inks-, including<br>
printing inks. Examples of high molecular mass organic materials are cellulose<br>
ethers and cellulose esters, such as ethylcellulose, nitrocellulose, cellulose acetate<br>
or cellulose butyrate, natural resins or synthetic resins, such as polymerization resins<br>
or condensation resins, for example, amino resins, especially urea-formaldehyde<br>
and melamine-formaldehyde resins, alkyd resins, acrylic resins, phenolic resins,<br>
polycarbonates, polyolefins, such as polystyrene, polyvinyl chloride, polyethylene,<br>
polypropylene, polyacrylonitrile, polyacrylates, polyamides, polyurethanes or<br>
polyesters, rubber, casein, silicone, and silicone resins, individually or in mixtures.<br>
Furthermore the product of the invention is also suitable for use as a colorant in<br>
rubber materials, office articles, wood coatings, and cleaning products, and also in<br>
artist's colors. Examples of typical printing inks are offset inks, illustration gravure<br>
inks, and printing inks for aqueous and solventborne packaging printing and for<br>
flexographic printing. The compound of the invention can be used as a colorant for<br>
printing inks, for example, by converting it into a sulfonated stage and aftertreating<br>
the product to form a powder or a paste. Examples of typical commercial names in<br>
this context are Reflex Blue R54, Reflex Blue A5H-R, Reflex Blue A5H-R31, Reflex<br>
Blue A6H-R, Reflex Blue A6H-R31 or Reflex Blue A6L-R31. Typical paints are<br>
automotive OEM and refinish paints, industrial paints, and architectural paints (e.g.,<br>
polymer renders or emulsion paints). Typical plastics colorations are those, for<br>
example, in plasticized and unplasticized PVC (polyvinyl chloride), polyolefins or<br>
polystyrenes.<br>
It matters not whether the high molecular mass organic compounds mentioned are<br>
in the form of plastic masses, melts or spinning solutions, paints, coating materials<br>
or printing inks. Depending on the intended utility it is found advantageous to use the<br>
product of the invention as a blend or in the form of preparations or dispersions.<br>
Based on the high molecular mass organic material for coloring, the product of the<br>
invention is used in an amount of from 0.05 to 70% by weight, preferably from 0.1 to<br>
15% by weight.<br><br>
The product of the invention is also suitable as a colorant and charge control agent<br>
in electrophotographic toners and developers, such as one-component or two-<br>
component powder toners (also called one-component or two-component<br>
developers), magnetic toners, liquid toners, polymerization toners, and specialty<br>
toners. Typical toner binders are addition-polymerization resins, polyaddition resins<br>
and polycondensation resins, such as styrene, styrene-acrylate, styrene-butadiene,<br>
acrylate, polyester, and phenol-epoxy resins, polysulfones, polyurethanes,<br>
individually or in combination and polyethylene and polypropylene which may<br>
contain further ingredients, such as charge control agents, waxes or flow assistants,<br>
or may be modified with these additives subsequently.<br>
The product of the invention is additionally suitable as a colorant and charge control<br>
agent in powders and powder coating materials, especially in triboelectrically or<br>
electrokinetically sprayable powder coating materials which are employed for coating<br>
the surfaces of articles made, for example, of metal, wood, plastic, glass, ceramic,<br>
concrete, textile material, paper or rubber. As a charge control agent the product in<br>
this case brings about an increase in the intrinsic electrostatic characteristics of the<br>
powder or powder coating material. Typical powder coating resins employed are<br>
epoxy resins, carboxyl- and hydroxyl-containing polyester resins, polyurethane, and<br>
acrylic resins, together with customary hardeners. Resin combinations are also<br>
employed. For example epoxy resins are frequently used in combination with<br>
carboxyl- and hydroxyl-containing polyester resins. Typical hardener components<br>
(depending on the resin system) are, for example, acid anhydrides, imidazoles, and<br>
dicyandiamide and derivatives thereof, blocked isocyanates, bisacylurethanes,<br>
phenolic resins and melamine resins, triglycidyl isocyanurates, oxazolines, and<br>
dicarboxylic acids.<br>
The blue colorant used in accordance with the invention can also be combined with<br>
further positive or negative charge control agents in order to obtain good<br>
performance chargeabilities, the overall concentration of the charge control agents<br>
being appropriately between 0.01 and 70% by weight, preferably between 0.05 and<br>
20% by weight, more preferably between 0.1 and 5% by weight, based on the total<br><br>
weight of the electrophotographic toner, developer, powder or powder coating,<br>
material.<br>

The concentration of these dispersing assistants and/or customary additives in the<br>
dispersion is appropriately between 0.001 and 80% by weight, preferably between<br>
0.01 and 50% by weight, based on the total weight of the dispersion.<br>
In order to prepare electrophotographic color toners it is possible to add further<br>
colorants such as organic chromatic pigments, inorganic pigments or dyes, usually in<br>
the form of powders, dispersions, presscakes, solutions or masterbatches.<br><br>
The organic chromatic pigments can be from the group of the azo pigments or<br>
polycyclic pigments or can be mixed crystals (solid solutions) of such pigments.<br>
Preferred blue pigments and/or green pigments are copper phthalocyanines, such<br>
as C.I. Pigment Blue 15, 15:1, 15:2, 15:3, 15:4, 15:6, P. Blue 16 (metal-free<br>
phthalocyanine), or phthalocyanine with aluminum, nickel; iron or vanadium as the<br>
central atom, and also triarylcarbonium pigments such as Pigment Blue 1, 2, 9, 10,<br>
14, 16,56,60,61,62,68,80; Pigment Green 1,4,7, 17,36,50 45; Orange<br>
pigments, such as P.O. 5, 13, 34, 36, 38, 43, 62, 68, 70, 72, 71, 74; Yellow<br>
pigments, such as P.Y. 12, 13, 14, 17, 74, 83, 93, 97, 111, 120, 122, 139, 151, 154,<br>
155, 174, 175, 176, 180, 174, 185, 194, 213, 214; red pigments, such as P.R. 2, 3,<br>
4,5,9,38,48,53,57, 112, 122, 144, 146, 147, 149, 168, 170, 175, 176, 177, 179,<br>
181, 184, 185, 186, 188, 189, 202, 207, 208, 209, 210, 214, 219, 238, 253, 254,<br>
255, 256, 257, 266, 269, 270, 272, 279; violet pigments, such as P.V. 1,19, 23, 32,<br>
carbon black such as P. Black 7, 11, 33 or in their surface-modified form as<br>
described in US 5,554,739, iron/manganese oxides; and also mixed crystals such as<br>
those, for example, of pigments described above such as C.I. Pigment Violet 19 and<br>
C.I. Pigment Red 122, and also azo-surface-modified pigments as described in WO<br>
01/30919.<br>
The mixtures can be prepared in the form of powders, granules, by mixing<br>
presscakes, spray-dried presscakes or masterbatches and also by dispersing<br>
(extrusion, kneading, roll-mill processes, bead mills, Ultraturrax, ultrasound) in the<br>
presence of a carrier material in solid or liquid form (aqueous and nonaqueous inks)<br>
and also by flushing in the presence of a carrier material. Where the colorant is used<br>
with high proportions of water or solvent (&gt; 5%), mixing can also take place at<br>
elevated temperatures, by subsequent cooling of the mixture mass with vacuum<br>
assistance. The flushing operation can take place in the presence or absence of<br>
organic solvents and of waxes.<br>
Particularly appropriate for increasing the brightness but also for shading the hue are<br>
mixtures with organic dyes. Preferred such dyes include the following:<br>
water-soluble dyes, such as Direct, Reactive, and Acid Dyes, and also solvent-<br>
soluble dyes, such as Solvent Dyes, Disperse Dyes, and Vat Dyes for example.<br><br>
Examples include the following: C.I. Reactive Yellow 37, Acid Yellow 23, Reactive<br>
Red 23, 180, Acid Red 52, Reactive Blue 19, 21, Acid Blue 9, Direct Blue 199,<br>

Vat Red 41, Solvent Black 45, 27.<br>
It is also possible to use dyes and pigments having fluorescent properties, such as<br>
®Luminols (Riedel-de Haen), in order for example to product anticounterfeit toners.<br>
Furthermore, the colorants may also be used in a special wax-coated form, as<br>
described in EP-A-1 204 005, in combination with the charge control agents of the<br>
invention.<br>
Inorganic pigments, such as TiO2 or BaSO4, for example, are used in mixtures for<br>
lightening. Also suitable are mixtures with effect pigments, such as pearlescent<br>
pigments, Fe2O3 pigments (®Paliochroms), and pigments based on cholesteric<br>
polymers, which exhibit different colors depending on the angle of observation.<br>
Electrophotographic toners and powder coating materials as well may further<br>
comprise waxes. The term "wax" refers to a range of substances, natural or<br>
synthetically obtained, which generally have the following properties: they are<br>
kneadable at 20°C, ranging from firm to hard and fragile, from coarse to finely<br>
crystalline, and from transluscent to opaque, but not glasslike; they melt without<br>
decomposition at 40°C, are of relatively low viscosity, without stringing, at just a little<br>
above the melting point, have a highly temperature-dependent consistency and<br>
solubility, and can be polished under gentle pressure.<br>
The following waxes are preferred: natural waxes such as plant waxes, e.g.,<br>
carnauba wax, candellila wax, and animal waxes, e.g., beeswax, modified natural<br>
waxes, such as paraffin wax, microwaxes, semisynthetic waxes, such as montan<br>
ester waxes, or synthetic waxes, such as polyolefin waxes, e.g., polyethylene and<br>
polypropylene waxes, polyethylene glycol waxes, cycloolefin copolymer waxes,<br>
amide waxes, such as N,N'-distearylethylenediamine, zirconocene waxes, and<br><br>
chlorinated or fluorinated polyolefin waxes or polyethylene-polytetrafluorefhylene<br>
wax mixtures.<br>
Also of interest is an electrophotographic toner, powder or powder coating material<br>
containing from 30 to 99.99% by weight, preferably from 40 to 99.5% by weight, of a<br>
customary binder, for example, a styrene, styrene-acrylate, styrene-butadiene,<br>
acrylate, urethane, acrylic, polyester or epoxy resin or a combination of the last two,<br>
from 0.01 to 50% by weight, preferably from 0.05 to 20% by weight, more preferably<br>
from 0.1 to 5% by weight, of the product of the invention, and, if desired, from 0.001<br>
to 50% by weight, preferably from 0.05 to 20% by weight, of a further colorant and/or<br>
charge control agent, based in each case on the total weight of the<br>
electrophotographic toner, powder or powder coating material.<br>
The compound described in accordance with the invention can further be applied to<br>
free-flow agents as an additional charge control element in suspended form or in a<br>
dry blend. The compound described in accordance with the invention can also be<br>
used for a carrier coating.<br>
The product of the invention is also suitable as a colorant in aqueous and<br>
nonaqueous inkjet inks and also in those inks which operate in accordance with the<br>
hot melt process. In this context it can also be used in combination with other inks in<br>
order to produce, for example, magenta, cyan, yellow or black inks.<br>
Inkjet inks generally contain a total of from 0.5 to 15% by weight, preferably from<br>
1.5 to 8% by weight, of the product of the invention (reckoned on a dry basis).<br>
Microemulsion inks are based on organic solvents and water together if desired with<br>
a hydrotropic substance (interface mediator). Microemulsion inks generally contain<br>
from 0.5 to 15% by weight, preferably from 1.5 to 8% by weight, of the product of the<br>
invention, from 5 to 99% by weight of water and from 0.5 to 94.5% by weight of<br>
organic solvent and/or hydrotropic compound.<br><br>
"Solvent based" inkjet inks contain preferably from 0.5 to 15% by weight of the<br>
product of the invention and from 85 to 99.5% by weight of organic solvent and/or<br>
hydrotropic compounds.<br>
Hot-melt inks are based usually on waxes, fatty acids, fatty alcohols or sulfonamides<br>
which are solid at room temperature and liquefy on heating, the preferred melting<br>
range being between about 60°C and about 140°C. Hot-melt inkjet inks consist for<br>
example essentially of from 20 to 90% by weight of wax and from 1 to 10% by<br>
weight of the product of the invention. Also present may be from 0 to 20% by weight<br>
of an additional polymer (as "dye dissolver"), from 0 to 5% by weight of dispersing<br>
assistant, from 0 to 20% by weight of viscosity modifier, from 0 to 20% by weight of<br>
plasticizer, from 0 to 10% by weight of tackifier, from 0 to 10% by weight<br>
transparency stabilizer (preventing crystallization of the waxes for example), and<br>
from 0 to 2% by weight of antioxidant. Typical additives and auxiliaries are described<br>
for example in US Patent 5,560,760.<br>
The compound of the invention is also suitable, furthermore, as an agent for shading<br>
black, red, yellow or brown hues, for example, in toners, developers, printing inks,<br>
varnishes, plastics, rubber materials, paints, office articles, artist's colors or inkjet<br>
inks.<br>
The product of the invention is also suitable, furthermore, as a colorant for color<br>
filters and also for both additive and subtractive color production, and additionally as<br>
a colorant and charge control agent for electronic inks or electronic paper ("e-<br>
paper"), which are known from the literature, such as, for example, from Shuichi<br>
Maeda, Kohei Gocho and Makoto Omodani, "Electrical Twisting Sticks in a<br>
Transparent Tube", Proceedings of the International Congress of Imaging Science<br>
2002, Tokyo, pp. 507-508.<br>
The compound described in accordance with the invention is also suitable,<br>
furthermore, for the surface modification of pigment particles as described for<br>
example in WO 01/30919 A1, US 5,922,118 or US 5,554,739.<br><br>
The compound described in accordance with the invention, moreover/as a charge<br>
control agent may considerably enhance the charging behavior and charge stability<br>
properties of electret materials, especially electret fibers. Typical electret materials<br>
are based on polyolefins, halogenated polyolefins, polyacrylates, polyacrylonitriles,<br>
polystyrenes or fluoropolymers, such as polyethylene, polypropylene,<br>
polytetrafluoroethylene, and perfluorinated ethylene and propylene, or on polyesters,<br>
polycarbonates, polyamides, polyimides, polyether ketones, on polyarylene sulfides,<br>
especially polyphenylene sulfides, on polyacetals, cellulose esters, polyalkylene<br>
terephthalates, and mixtures thereof. Electret materials, especially electret fibers,<br>
can be used for example to filter (ultrafine) dust. The electret materials may acquire<br>
their charge through corona or tribo charging.<br>
The compound described in accordance with the invention can also be used as a<br>
charge control agent in electrostatic separating operations, especially in operations<br>
to separate polymers. Absent charge control agents, the triboelectrical charging<br>
behavior of low density polyethylene (LDPE) and high density polyethylene (HDPE)<br>
is extremely similar. Following the addition of charge control agent, LDPE acquires a<br>
strongly positive charge and HDPE a strongly negative charge, and accordingly the<br>
two materials can be effectively separated. As well as applying the charge control<br>
agents to the exterior of the polymer it is also possible to incorporate them into the<br>
polymer, in order, for example, to shift the position of the polymer within the<br>
triboelectric voltage series and to obtain a corresponding separation effect. Other<br>
polymers can likewise be separated from one another in this way, such as<br>
polypropylene (PP) and/or polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and/or polyvinyl chloride<br>
(PVC), for example.<br>
The compound described in accordance with the invention can also be used,<br>
furthermore, to separate salt minerals, by improving the substrate-specific<br>
electrostatic charging through its addition (surface conditioning).<br>
Moreover, on account of its charge control properties, the compound described in<br>
accordance with the invention can also be used as an "electroconductivity providing<br>
agent" (ECPA) in inks for inkjet printers.<br><br>

In the examples below, parts and percentages are by weight.<br>
Preparation example:<br>
2.6 I of chlorobenzene and 600 g of aluminum chloride were combined in a flask with<br>
stirring at 25°C, after which 986 g of p-chlorobenzene trichloride were added in<br>
portions at max. 35°C and the mixture was heated to 60°C, stirred for 6 hours and<br>
then cooled to room temperature. Thereafter, at from 30 to 40°C, 520 ml of m-<br>
toluidine were added to the mixture, which was slowly heated to 130°C and then<br>
stirred at this temperature for 2 hours. Then 2.1 I of aniline were added over the<br>
course of 3 hours and the reaction temperature was raised to 160 - 165°C. The<br>
chlorobenzene was distilled off in this operation. In order to remove the residual<br><br>
chlorobenzene a gentle to moderate vacuum was applied at from 160 to 165°C.<br>
Finally the mixture was cooled again and the vacuum was removed.<br>
Then a second flask was charged with 3.3 I of 33% strength sodium hydroxide<br>
solution, the reaction mixture from the first flask was added with stirring at about<br>
95°C, and this mixture was stirred at 95°C for 3 hours. Following the addition of 2 I of<br>
water to the reaction mixture and stirring, the lower, aluminate phase was separated<br>
off. Thereafter 9.2 I of chlorobenzene and 4 I of water were added to the mixture,<br>
which was heated at 50°C with stirring and again left to settle for 1 hour. The lower,<br>
chlorobenzene phase, which contained the "blue base" was separated off and<br>
precipitated from 40% strength sulfuric acid solution in a precipitation cascade at<br>
from about 50 to 70°C, after which the "dyebase sulfate" obtained was filtered off.<br>
The precipitated and filtered dyebase sulfate was washed with water at 90 to 100°C<br>
and subjected to a steam distillation at 100°C, to subsequent filtration and drying at<br>
approximately 110°C on a rack dryer, to pasting of the dried product with ten times<br>
the amount by weight of water, and to a second steam distillation with subsequent<br>
filtration and drying at 110°C.<br>

1 part of the compound from the preparation example is incorporated<br>
homogeneously using a compounder over the course of 30 minutes into 99 parts of<br>
a toner binder (60:40 styrene-acrylate copolymer ®Almacryl B-1501). The resulting<br>
composition is then ground on a universal laboratory mill and subsequently classified<br>
on a centrifugal classifier. The desired particle fraction (4 to 25 urn) is activated with<br>
a carrier consisting of magnetite particles measuring from 50 to 200 µm which have<br>
been coated with 90:10 styrene-methacrylate copolymer.<br>
