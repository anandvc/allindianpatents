The invention relates to a yam feeding device.<br>
In the yam feeder of this kind known from WO 02/33156 A the second yam control device is constituted by a controlled yarn damp which is provided in withdrawal direction of the yarn length section downstream of the storage body and within the yam path. An important advantage of the known yam feeder results from the small diameter of the storage body allowing to achieve extraordinarily short insertion times and remarkably high insertion frequencies due to an extremely reduced ballooning effect during yam withdrawal. Such insertion times and insertion frequencies  preferably, are needed in today's air jet weaving machines in order to optimally use the full capability of the weaving machine. The first stop element in its stopping position terminates the withdrawal. The yam clamp starts the consecutive yam withdrawal when the first stop element has already been adjusted into the position for measuring the yam length which is to be released. Since the start and the end of the withdrawal not only is controlled in mechanically differing fashions but also at differing locations within the yam path, in case of delicate yam material it can be complicated to properly control the run of the measured yam section flying between the storage body and the yam clamp.<br>
In the yam feeder known from EP 0 098 254 a two pin-shaped stop elements are associated to the storage body. The stop elements are moved alternatingly axially and radially in order to start or to terminate the respective withdrawal and to measure each yam section. One stop element transfers yam windings representing one measured section in one of two different operating phases to the other stop element such that then the free yam tip of the stopped yarn carries out an aimer run movement in the main nozzle of the insertion device of the weaving machine. As normally at least two yarns are inserted alternatingly (weft mix), and since a free tip of one of the yams remains in the insertion device while the other yam is inserted, a free yam tip which projects too far from the insertion device might collide with the just inserted yam or even may be damaged by the just inserted yam. In one embodiment both stop elements are operating outside of the storage body. The change between the operation phases with and without a winding transfer automatically means a undesirable irregularity in the yam controlling process.<br><br>
The yarn feeder known from US 4,132,370 A is provided with four pin-shaped stop elements on a disk which Is rotatably arranged inside the storage body.   The stop elements are displaced axially and radially by a continuous rotation of the disk.   Since the respective active stop element is moved further in withdrawal direction with an axial motion component after the withdrawal has been terminated, the free yam tip is moved further out of the insertion device (insertion nozzle) of the weaving machine such that the tree yam tip may collide with another just inserted yam.<br>
Also in the case of the yam feeder according to US 4,498,639 A the tooth-shaped stop element is moved further in withdrawal direction after the withdrawal has been terminated such that the free yarn tip cames out an undesirable after run movement in the insertion device.<br>
The yam feeder known from DE 30 32 971 A has an additional controlled yam clamp downstream of the storage body which yam clamp starts each withdrawal but also prevents that the yam carries out an after run movement after the termination of the withdrawal.<br>
For the same reason a controlled yam clamp is provided at the yam feeder knovim from EP 0 250 359 A, and in addition to a plurality of tooth-shaped stop elements, in order to start each withdrawal, and to hold the yarn in advance while the active stop element is moved further.<br>
Because of the mechanism for the movement control of the stop elements in the interior of the storage body the yam feeders according to US 4,132,370 A, US 449,863 A, DE 30 32 971 A, EP 0 250 359 A need to be equipped with a large storage body which normally has a diameter of at least about 120 mm.   In case of high yam speeds such a large storage body, however, generates a marked ballooning effect in the withdrawn yam.  A strong ballooning effect means significant energy loss and does not allow flying times or insertion frequencies which could fulfil the requirements to fully use the capabilities of today's air jet weaving machines.<br>
It is an object of the invention to provide a yam feeder of the kind as mentioned at the beginning which allows to achieve an optimum and uniform yarn control without after njn<br><br>
movements despite the small diameter storage body provided for short flying times and high insertion frequencies.<br>
This object is achieved by a yam feeding device (F) having a yam measuring function, for a weaving machine, comprising a rotatably driven winding organ (W), a stationary small diameter storage body (K) defining a storage surface for intermediately storing a yam supply consisting of yam windings conveyed forward in the direction of the axis (X) of the storage body on the storage surface, from which yam supply measured yam sections are withdrawn intermittently over the front end of the storage body, a first pin-shaped stop element (S1) in a movement control stationarily arranged outside of the storage body (K) which first stop element (SI) is regularly movable relative to the storage surface and substantially radially to the axis between a withdrawal position outside the storage surface for releasing the yam (Y) and an engagement position engaging into the yam path and the storage surface in which engagement position the first stop element (SI) is axially movable from a position for measuring the yam into a stop position terminating the yam withdrawal, and at least one second yam control device which is arranged outside of the storage body by which second yam control device the measured section of the yam selectively is released or stopped, characterised in that the at least one second yam control device is a second pin-shaped stop element {S2) arranged in a second movement control stationarily provided outside of the storage body (K), which second stop element (S2) is arranged offset with respect to the first stop element (S!) in circumferential direction of the storage surface and which is movable regularly relative to the storage surface and substantially radially to the axis (X) between a withdrawal position outside of the storage surface for releasing the yam and an engagement position engaging into the yam path and into the storage surface in which engagement position the second stop element (S2) is movable from a position for measuring the yam axially into a stop position terminating the yam withdrawal, the first and second stop elements (SI, S2) in their respective engagement positions are altematingly movable into the stop positions and back and forth between the release positions and the engagement position such that one stop element starts a withdrawal and the other stop element terminates the same withdrawal, in the storage surface an axial position for each stop element (SI, S2) is defined as the yarn stop position and at the same time as a yam release position, where the stop element starts or terminates the yam withdrawal at the stop position by a movement away from or into the engagement position, and the defined axial positions of the stop element {SI, S2) are situated substantially in the same radial plane (E) of the storage body (K) which plane is perpendicular to the axis (X).<br><br>
The at least two stop elements altematingly control the start and the termination of the respective withdrawal or insertion in at least substantially the same mechanical fashion and also at substantially equal axial positions of the storage body such that an optimum and uniform yam control or yam geometry is achieved. Further, since the stop elements carry out these functions substantially in the same plane perpendicular to the axis of the storage body after the termination of the withdrawal an after run movement of the yam can be avoided. One of the stop elements respectively starts the withdrawal while the other terminates tli&amp;'same withdrawal. The free yam tip of the stopped yam correctly maintains its position in the insertion device until the consecutive insertion, e.g. in the insertion nozzle of the air jet weaving machine. A collision of the free yam tip with another just inserted yam can be avoided. The section of the yarn is measured in length very precisely and equally for each insertion such that weft yam losses can be kept low, because any excess length of the weft yam at the fabric edge remote trom the insertion side may be adjusted optimally short. A yam clamp downstream of the storage body can be dispensed with such that complications caused by the yam section between the storage body and such a yam clamp are excluded beforehand.<br>
Expediently, each stop element is moved from its position for measuring the yam while in the engagement position into the stop position by the windings on the storage body. This avoids a disturbing influence of the stop element on the yam movement along the storage body surface and improves the uniformity of the yam control even in case of high winding speeds. Furthemiore, the motion control ofthe stop element can be very simple because it only has the task of pulling the stop element while in the stopping position into the release position in order to start the withdrawal, and then to push the stop element from the release position back into the position for measuring the yam. Rehiming the stop element while in the release position back to the location of the position for measuring the yam can be carried out independently from the yam movement or the yam withdrawal and is, for these reasons, not very critical in terms of time. A simple drive can be used for this task, e.g. a spring only.<br><br>
Alternatively, it is possible to always move each stop element in a forced and controlled fashion such that the stop element carries out a cyclic orbiting motion.<br>
The diameter of the storage body expediently is set between about only 25 mm to about 60 mm, preferably even only between about 30 mm and 45 mm.   In a preferred embodiment the diameter of the storage body is variable in order to allow an adjustment of the nominal length of each measured yam section.   From this small size of the storage body a desirably weak ballooning effect results in the withdrawn yam even in case of high yarn running speeds.<br>
The stop positions of the stop elements may be defined by stops which are an-anged either in the storage body or outside of the storage body, e.g. in the motion controls of the stop elements themselves.   The stops expediently can be adjusted.<br>
In order to achieve uniform withdrawal relationships and in case of only two stop elements, those stop elements should be offset to each otfier by about 180° about the axis of the storage body.<br>
In an alternative embodiment more than only two stop elements are provided. In this case all provided stop elements are arranged with at least substantially regular distribution about the axis.<br>
In a simple embodiment the stop element has a first part which is connected to the drive means, and a yam control part with the shape of a pin which is connected to the first part by means of a resilient joint.   The resilient or springy joint serves as a drive assembly for returning the yarn control part while in the release position from the location of the stop position to the location of the position for measuring yam.   The resilient joint is resiliently pre-loaded, preferably, mainly in the direction to the location of the position for measuring the yam.  A magnet armature which either is actuated counter to spring force or is actuated bi-directionally may serve as the drive assembly for moving the stop element between the release position and the engagement position.   In case of a movement control which carries out a forced motion of the stop element also for the movement of the stop element between the locations of the stop position and the position for measuring the yam a bi-<br><br>
directionaiiy actuatable magnet or a magnet amnature actuated counter to spring force may be used.<br>
An embodiment of the invention will be described with the help of the drawings.   In the drawings is:<br>
Fig. 1	a schematic perspective view of a part of a yam feeder,<br>
Figs 2-7        several distinct operation phases during the operation of the yarn feeder of Fig. 1, and<br>
Fig. 8	a schematic section of a movement control of a stop element.<br>
A yam feeder F (Fig. 1} having a yam measuring function, for a weaving machine (not shown), has a stationary earner 1 on which a storage body K is provided.   The storage body K resembles a rod cage having axially extending rods 3 the outer surfaces of which define a storage surface 4 which is substantially cylindrical or, preferably, as shown in Fig. 1, is tapered such that the diameter decreases in Fig. 1 to the right side.   The rods 3 are fixed by foot parts 5 at the carrier 1 such that they can be adjusted radially (radial adjustment devices 6) within a certain range in order to allow to vary the outer diameter of the storage body K for the adaptation to the respective weaving width of the weaving machine.   The outer diameter d (Fig. 2) of the storage body K amounts only to about between 25 mm and 60 mm, preferably about 30 mm to 45 mm.   The axial length of the storage surface 4 is larger than the magnitude of the outer diameter d.<br>
A winding organ W, e.g. a winding tube carrying an outlet eyelet, is rotating (arrow 2) around the outer circumference of the canier 1.  The winding organ W is connected with a not shown hollow drive shaft.<br>
First and second pin-shaped stop elements SI, S2 are associated to the storage body K at two diametrically opposed areas (offset about 180° about the axis X of the storage body K). The stop elements are arranged at stationary movement controls 15 which are not shown in Fig. 1 but can be seen in Fig. 8.   The stop elements S1, S2 are moved aitematingiy and as indicated by the curves A, B, and in particular e.g. depending on the rotational motion of the<br><br>
winding organ W.  The curves A, B are mirror-symmetrical in relation to the axis X and are at least substantially identical and are provided essen(ially in planes which are oriented radially to the axis X.<br>
A yam not shown in Fig. 1 (indicated by Y in Figs 2 to 7) runs from the winding organ W to the storage surface 4 and is wound on the storage surface 4 In adjacent windings which, In Fig. 1, move parallel to each other fon/vard in axial direction and fonn a yam supply which intermediately is stored on the storage body K.   The njot shown weaving machine, e.g. an air jet weaving machine having a main nozzle, withdraws from this yarn supply a measured section of the yam for each insertion.   In this case the first and second stop elements SI, S2 in co-action are measuring the yam section for the irespective withdrawal and also have to start and to temninate the respective withdrawal.   The start of the withdrawal e.g. is triggered by a trig signal transmitted from the weaving ^machine.<br>
The course of the movement of the first stop element $1 is explained with the help of the curve A.   The stop element SI is moved by its movenient control radially with respect to the axis X between an engagement position and a release position such that the engagement position will be taken along the curve part 12.   In the engagement position the tip of the stop element SI enters into the movement p^th of the yarn windings on the storage surface 4 or even into the storage surface 4 (between the rods 3).  Along the curve part 9 the tip of the stop element Is in the release position, meaning that the tip is located outside of the movement path of the yam windings on the storage surface 4 and outside of the storage surface 4.  The stop element SI also is moved additionally in axial direction, and, in particular, along the curve part 9 by a drive of the drive control, but axially and along the curve part 12 by the yam windings themselves,   (Ih case of a not shown embodiment the movement control ofthe stop element SI, however, could also contain a drive which controls the movement of the stop element SI along ttle curve part 12.)   In order to avoid that windings may slip through, expediently the tip of each stop element SI, S2 in the engagement position is moving within an axial groove br an axial slot of a rod 3.<br>
In the engagement position the stop element SI is moved in the direction of the arrow between a position 11 for measuring the yam and a st6p position 7, and, as mentioned, either by the windings themselves or by a not shown drive.   In the release position the stop element S1 is moved along the curve part 9 from locatibn 8 corresponding to the stop<br><br>
position 7 to a location 10 corresponding to the position 11 for measuring the yam, and, in particular, by means of a drive assembly of the movement control.   The stop element S1 then is drawn from the stop position 7 in the direction of the arrow to location 8.   From the location 10 the stop element S1 is pushed in the direction of the arrow into the position 11 for measuring the yam.   The course of the movement for the second stop element S2 (curve B) is analogous, i.e., the movement follows the curve part 9' (release position of the second stop element S2) in the direction of the arrow and follows the curve part 12' (engagement position) in the direction of the an-ow, and then from the stop position T to location 8'orfrom the location 10' into the position 11'for measuring the yam, respectively. Both stop elements SI, S2 are moved altematingly such that they altematingly carry out a yam measuring function, and start or tenninate the withdrawal, respectively.<br>
In case of an altemative, not shown, embodiment there could be provided even more than two stop elements 81, 82, e.g. three, four or six stop elements which are distributed regularly about the circumference of the storage body K and which are also brought in action altematingly.<br>
Certain operation phases of the yam feeder of Fig. 1 will be explained with the help of Figs 2 to 7.   Fig. 2 indicates an operation phase in which the first stop element 81 while in its engagement position has reached a stationary stop 13 at the stop position 7 and prior to this first has terminated the withdrawal of one measured section of the yarn.   The yarn Y which extends over the front end of the storage body K to a not shown insertion device, e.g. to the main nozzle of an air jet weaving machine, has been stopped and remains motionless.  A plurality of new adjacent yam windings is formed on the storage surface 4, and, in particular, by the substantially continuous rotation motion (an-ow 2) of the winding organ W.  At the same time the second stop element S2 as well Is brought into its engagement position and canies out a movement along the curve part 12' such that a predetermined number of windings is present between the first and second stop elements 81, 82.   This predetemnined number of windings represents one further measured section of the yam prepared for vwthdrawal.   Further yarn windings already are also present upstream of the second stop element 82,<br>
Now, e.g. in the weaving machine, a trig signal is emitted.   The movement control of the first stop element 81 responds so to the trig signal that the first stop element SI which is at<br><br>
the stop position 7 at the stop 13 is pulled back to the location 8 of the curve A.   At the same time the second stop element S2 is moved further along the curved part 12' by the permanently added new yam windings.   As the arrow 14 indicates now the measured section of the yarn is withdrawn.   The second stop element S2 moves further along the curved part 12' such that it then will be close to or at a stop 13' which defines the stop position T of the second stop element S2, when practically all yam windings present downstream of the second stop element S2 have been withdrawn.   The stops 13,13' define the stop position 7, 7' at least substantially In the same plane E which is peipendicular to the axis X, i.e., at substantially equal axial positions of the storage surface 4.<br>
As soon as the first stop element SI while being pulled back from the stop position approaches the location 8 it already will again be moved by the drive control along the curve part 9 in the direction towards the location 10.<br>
In Fig. 4 the second stop element S2 in its stop position 7' has terminated the withdrawal. The yam Y downstream of the second stop element S2 has stopped.  At the same time permanently new yam windings are wound on upstream of the second stop element S2. The first stop element SI is moving along the curved part 9 and already is close to the location 10.  As soon as a predetermined number of yam windings has been wound onto the storage surface 4 the first stop element 31 is pushed from the location 10 into the position 11 for measuring the yam and into the engagement position (Fig. 5), and, in particular, behind the last yam winding which is intended for the consecutive withdrawal and in front of the yam winding will be the first of a further withdrawal.   By consecutively winding on further yam windings the first stop element 81 immediately is again moved along the curve part 12.  The second stop element S2 still is in its stop position 7' at the stop 13, while the necessary number of yam windings is present between both stop elements SI, S2.   The downstream yarn Y still is stopped.<br>
In Fig. 6 e.g. the next trig signal has been emitted by the weaving machine. The second stop element S2 is pulled from the stop position to the location 8' and into its release position.   By this action the next withdrawal is started.   The yam windings present downstream of the first stop element 81 which is moving along the curve part 12, are released for withdrawal and are {an"ow 14) withdrawn, respectively.   At the same time the<br><br>
first stop element SI further is moving along the curve part 12 in the direction to the stop position 7 which it reaches in Fig. 7 partly by the pushing action of the newly wound on yarn windings and partly due to the tension of the withdrawn yarn Y.   The first stop element SI temninates the withdrawal when reaching the stop position 7.  After this withdrawal has been tenninated the second stop element 82 has been pushed again into its position 11' for measuring the yarn and Is already moving along the curve part 12' in the direction to its stop position 7' due to the pushing forces of the consecutively wound on yam windings.   This means that now again the operation phase according to Fig. 2 has been reached.<br>
Summarised, this means that one respective stop element starts a withdrawal by being pulled back from its stop position while the other stop element which just carries out the yam measuring function Is brought into its stop position and temiinates the withdrawal by the yam windings and the yam tension during the withdrawal action.<br>
The yam controls 15 (Fig. 8) may be the same for both stop elements SI, S2.   Each yarn control 15 has a housing 16 containing a solenoid coil 17 and an iron core 18. Furthermore, an axially movable magnet amiature 19 Is provided.  A spring 20 Is arranged between the iron core 18 and magnet annature 19 which urges the magnet armature 19 away from the iron core 18.  The stop element 31 (S2) consists of a first pin-shaped part<br>
21	which is connected to the magnet armature 19 and an also pin-shaped yarn control part<br>
22	which is connected via a resilient joint 23 with the first part 21.   The resilient or springy joint 23 e.g. consists of an elastomeric material, e.g. polyurethane, and generates a pre¬load which actuates the yam control part towards an e.g. indicated stop 24 which defines the shown position 11 or 11' for measuring the yam, respectively.  A weak permanent magnet could preliminarily hold the yarn control part 22 at the stop 24.   Furthermore, the stop 13 or 13', respectively is provided in the opposite direction from stop 24 within the housing 16.   This stop 13,13' could be adjustable in order to allow to precisely define the stop position 7.   In Fig. 8 the stop element S1 or 82, respectively, is shown in its engagement position adjusted by the spring 20.  Upon energization of the magnet winding or coil 17 the magnet armature 19 Is attracted to the iron core 18.   The spring 20 will become compressed such that the stop element SI is pulled into its not shown release position.<br><br>
Instead of a magnet operating in one direction only counter to the spring force instead a bi-directionally actuated magnet or an arrangement of two magnets operating in opposite directions could be used as the movement control of the stop element S1 or S2, respectively, between the engagement position and the release position.   In the mentioned case of a forced and totally controlled movement of the stop element S1 or S2, respectively, even between the position for measuring the yarn and the stop position a movement drive (not shown) could be provided which might be similar and might operate in the same way as the above-explained movement drive which is used for the axial movement of the yam control part 22.<br><br><br>

the at least one second yam control device is a second pin-shaped stop element (S2) arranged in a second movement control (15) stationarily provided outside of the storage body (K), which second stop element (S2) is arranged offset with respect to the first stop element (SI) in direction of the storage surface (4) and which is movable regularly relative to the storage surface (4) and substantially radially to the axis (X) between a withdrawal position (8', 10') outside of the storage surface (4) for releasing the yam and an engagement position engaging into the yam path and into the storage surface (4) in which engagement position the second stop element (S2) is movable from a position (J J') for measuring the yam axially into a slop position (7'} lerminalirg the yam withdrawal,<br>
the first and second stop elements (SI, S2) in their respective engagement positions are bleatingly movable into the stop positions (7, 7') and back and forth between the release positions and the engagement position such that one stop element starts a withdrawal and the other stop element terminates the same withdrawal.<br><br>
in the storage surface (4) an axial position for each stop element (SI, S2) is defined as the yam stop position (7, 7') and at the same time as a yam release position where the stop element starts or terminates the yam withdrawal at the stop position by a movement away from or into the engagement position, and<br>
the defined axial positions of the stop element (SI, S2) are situated substantially in the same radial plane (E) of the storage body (K) which plane is perpendicular to the axis (X).<br>
2.	The yam feeding device as claimed in claim I, wherein the movement control (15) of the respective stop element (SI, S2) has drive means for radially adjusting the respective stop element between the release position and the engagement position and for an axial adjustment only from the stop position (7, 7') back into the position (II, 11') for measuring the yam, and that the stop element (SI, S2) is constructed such or is arranged such in the movement control that while being in the engagement position it is moved by the axially conveyed yam windings on the storage surface (4) from the position (11,11') for measuring the yam into the stop position (7, 7').<br>
3.	The yam feeding device as claimed in claim 1, wherein the movement control (15) of each stop element (SI, S2) has drive means (17, 18, 19) for radially displacing the stop element between Chem. release position and the engagement position and for axially adjusting the stop element back and forth between the position for measuring the yam and the stop position.<br>
4.	The yam feeding device as claimed in claim 1, wherein the diameter (d) of the storage body amounts between 25 mm lo 60 mm, preferably between 30 mm to 45 mm, and that the diameter (d), preferably, is variable.<br>
5.	The yam feeding device as claimed in claim I, wherein the stop positions (7, 7') of the stop elements (SI, S2) are defined by stops (13, 13') which are situated within or outside of the storage body (K).<br><br>
6.	The yam feeding device as claimed in claim I, wherein the first and second stop elements (S1, S2) are offset to each other about the axis (X) with about 180°.<br>
7.	The yam feeding device as claimed in claim 1, wherein more than only one second stop element (S2) is provided, and that all stop elements (SI, S2) are distributed substantially regularly around the axis (X).<br>
8.	The yam feeding device as claimed in claim 1, wherein the stop element (SI, S2) has first<br>
part (2 J) which is connected either to a magnet armature (19) which is actuable, preferably, counter to<br>
a spring force (20), or to a bi-directionally actuable magnet armature, and a second yam control part<br>
(22) which is connected to the first part (21) via a resilient joint (23), preferably via an elastomeric<br>
joint, the resilient joint (23) being resiliently pre-loaded in movement direction of the yam control<br>
part (22) from the stop position (7, 7') to the position (11, IT) for measuring the yam.<br><br></td>
