Field of Invention<br>
This invention related to an effluent filtering device for use in the septic tanks for filtering and removing the excreta from the water flowing outside the septic tank.<br>
Background of Invention<br>
A septic tank having an inlet to receive the excreta from the house and an outlet provided with a baffle device (having a filter) to keep solids out of the drain water is known in the art. The baffle device is provided at the outlet end of a septic tank and disposed within the tank, to reduce the percentage of solid particulate matter in the liquid that exits from the tank by way of the outlet port. The device generally reduces the percentage of the outgoing excreta by directing the same away from the outlet port and by slowing or otherwise disturbing liquid flow towards the outlet port so that the effect of gravity on the solid particles is greater than the effect of the current which would otherwise carry these out of the tank.<br>
The use of a baffle device is advisable even at the inlet port of a septic tank and within the tank so as to prevent flow of excreta across the top of the tank and to direct its flow downward and across the depth of the tank. This brings fresh microbes to the sludge at the bottom of the tank and stirs it, contributing to the fermentation of waste material in the tank. There are various types of filtering device for septic known in the art. These are disclosed in patent no: US5762792, US5690825, US5582716 and US5720875.In India also various types of septic tank filtering device is known such as Ashoka septic tank, Janta septic tank and Shankar septic tank.<br>
A baffle device disclosed in US patent no: 4832846, has a conduit and a flow director flap portion. The conduit includes, at its front, a curved wall generated on an axis running the length of the conduit. One pair each of two pairs of angled walls, extending through the length of the conduit, is attached to each side of the curved<br><br>
wall by a free edge of one of the pair, the other edge of the pair being attached to a wall for mounting, the wall having holes for mounting the baffle to a concrete septic tank wall, over a port in the tank wall. The angled walls are preferably perpendicular to each other and to the wall for mounting, the two walls for mounting being coplanar and at the back of the conduit. The flow director portion includes two angled walls, one is for attaching the portion to the back of the conduit, the other extends over the end of the conduit and has a surface that is further from the curved wall than it is from the paired walls when the flow director portion is attached to the conduit. The baffle is mounted vertically to the tank wall by fasteners, which are inserted through the holes that are near the top of the conduit, and into anchors, which are molded into the tank wall in a pattern for matching the holes and positioning the baffle over the port.<br>
Yet another device disclosed in U.S. Pat. No; 3,630,370 describes a biconic deflector, with its central axis concentric with the axis of the vertical pipe of the outlet opening of the septic tank. The biconic deflector is located immediately below the bottom end of the vertical pipe, which extends down into the liquid in the tank, held in place below the pipe by holding means inserted into the bottom of the pipe.<br>
Still another device disclosed in 5618445 in a septic tank comprising a planar bottom, a gas and particulate matter baffle comprising a vertical outlet pipe being open at the bottom of the pipe, a cup having a closed top, a cavity, an open bottom continuous with the cavity, and a wall of said cup enclosing the cavity and connecting the closed top to the open bottom of the cup, said open bottom of the cup having a larger area than the closed top, support means connected to said vertical pipe for supporting the bottom of the cup directly below the pipe opening with said cavity facing downward toward the planar bottom under the pipe.<br>
Another device disclosed in US patent No: 5593584,a filter unit for a septic tank including a cylindrical filter housing having two chambers therein, a first chamber having a plurality of stacked disc-dam filter units and a second chamber. Each disc-<br><br>
dam filtering unit is provided with an upstream side and a downstream side and the cylindrical housing has an opening in the bottom thereof in flow communication with the upstream side of the disc-dam filtering units. A vertically extending partition is provided to separate the first chamber from the second chamber and the partition includes flow through openings there through of preselected size for controlling the rate of flow from the downstream side of the disc-dam units into the second chamber.<br>
Yet another device disclosed in US Patent No: 5762790,a filtering system for filtering effluent in a septic system comprising a filter housing with sides, a top and an open bottom, a filter element holder secured within the filter housing, wherein the filter element holder contains a top and a side portion, a discharge opening in the filter housing located generally above the filter element holder for discharging filtered effluent from the filter housing, a plurality of filter elements, each secured to the filter element holder, each with a top, bottom and side, wherein the bottom of each filter element is closed to prevent flow of the effluent through the bottom of the filter element, wherein each filter element contains filtering slots for filtering solids contained in the effluent and a separation element for separating one filter element from other filter elements, which element does not significantly impede the flow of effluent through the filtering system.<br>
Still another device disclosed in US Patent No: 5683577,a filter device useful in continuous separation of solid matter from a liquid, such as liquid wastewater, where the filter includes a tubular filter element with a series of slots of selected width extending through the tubular element. The filter element has a longitudinally extending central opening with a fluid inlet therein and is received in a first tubular casing with an annular area defined between the tubular filter element and the first casing so the central opening is open to receive liquid to be filtered, liquid being filtered as the liquid flows outwardly through the slots from the central opening to the annular area. A seal is provided between the tubular element and the inside of the first casing at a location below the slots in the tubular element to prevent unfiltered<br><br>
wastewater from entering the annular area. A second tubular casing is provided which extends downwardly beyond the lower terminating end of the tubular filter element, the second tubular casing including flow-through openings or slots therein for the passage of liquid there through. The second tubular casing flow-through openings are in flow communication with a fluid inlet into the central opening of the filter element.<br>
Another device disclosed in US Patent No: 5885452,an effluent filtering apparatus including an effluent filter fluidly connected to the output of an effluent pump disposed in an effluent tank, for providing filtered effluent to a drain field having a plurality of finger pipes defining a plurality of finger apertures. The effluent filter includes a tubular member defining a plurality of filtering orifices through a cylindrical wall. Effluent flows into the tubular member through an open first end and flows out of the tubular member through the filtering orifices, with turbulence within the tubular member preventing at least a portion of solid material present in the effluent from lodging within the filtering orifices. Effluent containing solid material smaller in size than the filtering orifices flows from the effluent tank to the drain field, but larger solid material present in effluent is filtered by the filtering orifices, with the filtering orifices remaining unobstructed for an extended period of time due to turbulent flow within the tubular member. A basket like filter insert may be disposed within the tubular member proximate to the first end, defining a plurality of openings there through permitting flow of effluent but preventing solid material aggregated within the tubular member larger than the dimensions of the openings from flowing backwards from the tubular member and into the pump when the pump is deactivated.<br>
