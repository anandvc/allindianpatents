FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to an arrangement comprising<br>
functional server nodes, e.g. packet data support nodes,<br>
forming part of a conglomerate, or a pool, of functional<br>
server nodes in common controlling a number of radio networks<br>
or radio network control means, each functional server node<br>
being able to control any, or a number of, radio network<br>
control means, to which mobile stations are connected. The<br>
invention also relates to a functional server node and to a<br>
method for transferring mobile stations contexts between<br>
functional server nodes.<br>
STATE OF THE ART<br>
In communication systems supporting communication of packet<br>
data including a number of radio networks and core networks,<br>
e.g. a PLMN, each radio network generally comprises radio<br>
network control means, comprising one of more radio network<br>
control nodes controlling a number of base stations, to which<br>
user stations can be connected or attached. Generally a radio<br>
network control means, or a radio network control node, is<br>
controlled by a packet data support node of the core network.<br>
For GPRS/UMTS such a packet data support node is denoted an<br>
SGSN (Serving GPRS Support Node) Another support node in such<br>
a communication system is the GGSN (Gateway GPRS Support Node)<br>
which handles or controls communication with external packet<br>
data networks. In systems known today the packet data support<br>
nodes, e.g. SGSN:s, control one or more radio network control<br>
means, i.e. they are responsible for such radio network<br>
control means, for example RNC:s (Radio Network Controller).<br>
In many systems it is fixed which packet data support node,<br>
e.g. SGSN, controls which RNC(s). Systems in which the packet<br>
data support functionality is provided by non-split, single<br>
nodes are (here) denoted monolithic systems. In other systems<br>
(split up architechtures) a packet data support node,<br>
particularly an SGSN, is split up in two "sub-nodes", namely<br><br>
an SGSN server and another sub-node denoted media gateway<br>
(MGW) wherein the SGSN server node handles user plane<br>
functionalities. However, redundancy issues are problematic in<br>
such a system, as in other pooled and non-pooled systems,<br>
since if an SGSN is malfunctioning, packet communication will<br>
fail unless another SGSN can be allocated or a redundant SGSN<br>
can be provided for. Generally, as a subscriber performs an<br>
attach procedure to the network, the RNC controlling the base<br>
stations it connects to, passes the attach request to the SGSN<br>
it is connected to, 1 e. which SGSN that is used can be said<br>
to be based on the location of the subscriber<br>
This gives rise to problems also as far as load sharing is<br>
concerned, which generally is not handled in any satisfactory<br>
manner. As an example, at rush hours a large number of<br>
subscribers move in one and the same direction, since the<br>
selection of SGSN is location dependent, i.e. it depends on<br>
which radio network the subscriber has attached to, the SGSNs<br>
m such areas run the risk of being overloaded whereas other<br>
SGSNs hardly are used at all. Later and/or earlier the<br>
situation may be the opposite. This means that the SGSNs have<br>
to be dimensioned for the "worst case". Moreover, as a<br>
subscriber is roaming within the network such that the closest<br>
base station will be controlled by another radio network<br>
control means that the one he attached to, and hence the SGSN<br>
which is responsible for a particular radio network control<br>
means is statically configured, the responsibility for the<br>
connection will be taken over by another SGSN etc. This<br>
involves a lot of signalling e.g. with the home location<br>
register node (HLR) of the subscriber, i.e. it requires HLR<br>
updates, which means a load on the HLR and it involves a lot<br>
of signalling. To make reconfigurations and to add equipment<br>
in such a system will also involve high costs and much<br>
configurational work. Still further high costs are involved<br>
when such a system needs to be built out, i.e when new nodes<br><br>
or nodes with a greater capacity, or nodes replacing<br>
malfunctioning servers, need to be added. Such solutions are<br>
disadvantageous as far as load sharing is concerned, and<br>
packet data support node redundancy is not provided for to a<br>
sufficient extent, network configuration work gets expensive,<br>
time consuming and complicated. In addition thereto packet<br>
data support nodes are associated with specific radio network<br>
control means which means that, for a roaming subscriber, the<br>
responsibility for such a subscriber by a packet data support<br>
node will be transferred to other packet data support nodes as<br>
the subscriber moves throughout the network. This leads to a<br>
lot of signalling between packet data support nodes and home<br>
location register nodes of the subscriber in order to update<br>
involved nodes (HLR-nodes, SGSN-SGSN, SGSN-GGSN) which puts a<br>
high load on e.g the home location register node and requires<br>
a lot of signalling m general. This problem gets even more<br>
serious if, at given time, a plurality of subscribers moves<br>
substantially along the same path cf rush hour traffic<br>
Therefore an improved split up architecture solution has been<br>
suggested in the Swedish Patent Application No. 0003719-2,<br>
filed on October 13, 2000, and the content of which herewith<br>
is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
This document shows a communication system with a split up<br>
architecture in which at least some of the packet data support<br>
nodes are divided into a functional server node (FSN) and a<br>
functional user gateway node (UGN). Alternatively the<br>
functional server node functionality, i.e. the control plane<br>
functionalities, of a number of packet data support nodes,<br>
i.e. functional server nodes, are provided in a pool, no<br>
functional user gateway nodes being provided A number of<br>
functional server nodes are provided to, in common, control at<br>
least a number of routing areas served by different radio<br>
network control means. These functional server nodes are<br>
arranged to form a pool of functional server nodes and each of<br><br>
the functional server nodes in a said pool is able to control<br>
any of the radio network control means.<br>
However, when several core network nodes support the same<br>
Radio Access Network (RAN), known as pooling of nodes as<br>
discussed above (for split up as well as monolithic<br>
structures), a mechanism is generally needed to transfer<br>
terminals from one node to another e g. for load sharing<br>
purposes. This is applicable when a node needs to be taken<br>
down for service. It is also applicable when a node is<br>
introduced (either new or restarted) into the pool and<br>
terminals should be transferred to it to more quickly balance<br>
the load within the pool. Otherwise it may take a very long<br>
time before the pool gets balanced again, due to the fact that<br>
terminals remember their P-TMSI (Packet Temporary Mobile<br>
Subscriber Id) at power off. They always return to their<br>
previous SGSN at power on, even if a new, less loaded SGSN has<br>
been added to the pool (on the assumption that the terminal is<br>
still within a routing area within the pool area)<br>
In earlier solutions, in a pooled environment, terminals were<br>
exclusively distributed among the pooled core nodes by the<br>
RAN. This is done when a terminal either powers on or is asked<br>
by the network to re-connect There were no mechanism to<br>
transfer a terminal to another node without breaking the<br>
connection of the terminal and therefore the user service<br>
To move a terminal from a node, these known mechanisms<br>
required that the terminal moves out from the pool and back<br>
again. Since the idea with a pool is to keep terminals as long<br>
as possible within the pool, there is normally a small<br>
fraction of terminals doing this This was the only way to<br>
redistribute and balance the load and it takes quite some<br>
time, especially for new/restarted nodes, to take an equal<br>
share of the terminal load in the pool. For making a pool of<br>
nodes functioning well, a faster mechanism which can be<br><br>
controlled by the network operator to redistribute terminals<br>
between nodes is suggested in PCT/EP03/02944 filed on<br>
20.03.2003 by the same applicant as the present invention and<br>
the content of which herewith is incorporated herein by<br>
reference. This document shows a procedure which makes it<br>
possible to trigger e.g. an ISRAU (Inter SGSN Routing Area<br>
Update) of an MS in a controlled manner between SGSNs in a<br>
pool. This, however, requires proprietary signalling between<br>
e g. SGSNs (or more generally packet data support nodes or<br>
functional server nodes) in a pool, which may be somewhat<br>
complex.<br>
The pool concept is described in 3GPP Standard TS 23.236,<br>
which herewith is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
What is needed is therefore an improved and less complex<br>
mechanism, i.e. an arrangement, a functional server node and a<br>
method through/by which mobile stations can be transferred to<br>
other nodes within the conglomerate or pool of nodes without<br>
affecting the connection for the end user terminal.<br>
Particularly an arrangement and a functional server node, e.g.<br>
a packet data support node is needed which is able to transfer<br>
terminals to other nodes, e g when the node needs to be taken<br>
down for service or similar A solution is also needed through<br>
which terminals can be transferred to a newly introduced node<br>
in the pool; it may relate to a "new" node, or to a restarted<br>
node, among others in order to distribute the load between the<br>
nodes within the conglomerate/pool. A solution is particularly<br>
needed through which it can be provided for load sharing,<br>
balancing the load as desired, among the nodes.<br>
A solution is also needed through which mobile stations or<br>
terminals can be transferred from a node which is taken down,<br>
either for maintenance or because it is malfunctioning, or<br><br>
which is overloaded or running the risk of being overloaded. A<br>
solution is also needed through which mobile stations can be<br>
transferred/redistributed in a fast and easy manner, without<br>
substantially deteriorating the service offered to the end<br>
user.<br>
Still further a solution is needed through which mobile<br>
stations or terminals can be transferred to substantially any<br>
selected node within the pool/conglomerate, and through which<br>
the transfer (s) may be performed in a scheduled manner<br>
Further yet a solution is needed through which mobile stations<br>
can be transferred between nodes with minimized (or no<br>
additional) signalling as compared to the case when a mobile<br>
station is not transferred. Particularly a solution is needed<br>
through which all mobile stations can be transferred from a<br>
node (to one or more other nodes) when needed and without<br>
impact on the end users concerned.<br>
Even more particularly a solution as referred to above is<br>
needed which is applicable also for shared networks, if<br>
several operators are concerned, e.g. have one or more radio<br>
networks in common, while there being different core networks.<br>
A method is also needed through which one or more of the above<br>
mentioned objects can be achieved.<br>
Particularly, in a shared network scenario, a solution is also<br>
needed for taking care of redirection/redistribution of mobile<br>
stations having been directed or transferred to the wrong<br>
node, e.g. a node where the mobile station is not a subscriber<br>
or where there is no agreement with the subscriber's operator<br>
etc.<br>
Therefore an arrangement, a node and a method respectively<br>
having the characterizing features of the respecive<br>
independent claims are provided<br><br>
Preferred, or advantageous, embodiments are given by the<br>
subclaims<br>
Throughout this document the Functional Server Node (FSN)<br>
which can be part of a pool or conglomerate arrangement, can<br>
be either a packet data support node (e.g. an SGSN or a CGSN<br>
i.e. a combined packet data support node, e.g. a CGSN which<br>
supports also GGSN functionalities) (with integrated control<br>
plane and user plan, i.e. ma monolithic architecture), or a<br>
packet data support node handling only control plane<br>
functionality, (e.g. SGSN server or a CGSN server) in a split<br>
up architecture, or an MSC<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Figs. 1-3 show examples on communication systems or networks<br>
wherein the inventive concept can ' be implemented and which<br>
implement pools or conglomerates respectively of functional<br>
server nodes.<br>
Fig 1 and 2 show so called split (up) architectures in which<br>
the functionality of a packet data1 support node is split in<br>
two nodes<br>
Fig. 3 shows a monolithic architecture, i.e there is no split<br>
but the entire functionality is provided by a single node. It<br>
should be clear that particulars of Figs 1, 2 can be<br>
implemented also in monolithic architecture, and, vice versa,<br>
that particulars of Fig. 3 can be implemented in a split<br>
architecture.<br>
Fig. 4 shows an example of an environment with shared networks<br>
implementing conglomerates, i.e. there are different operators<br>
involved.<br>
More specifically Fig. 1 shows a communication system (e g.<br>
GPRS or UMTS) supporting communication of packet data. It<br>
comprises an IP connectivity backbdne network and a number of<br>
radio neworks RANI, RAN2, ,RAN6 (only RAN1-RAN3 explicitly<br>
indicated). Each radio network comprises a number of base<br>
stations BS which are controlled l by radio network control<br>
means RNC 11, ,RNC 16 respectively. In the figure user<br>
equipment station (mobile station) UEA is illustrated which<br>
e.g. comprises a computer connected to a mobile station MS&amp;<br>
which here connects to RAN2. In this application mobile<br>
station is taken to mean a UE or a MS etc Packet data support<br>
node functionality is provided by functional server nodes FSN<br>
and user gateway nodes UGN respectively. Thus, a number of<br><br>
decomposed packet data support nodes are provided as FSN 1 -<br>
FSN 8 and UGN 21-2 6.<br>
The functional server nodes FSN 1, , FSN 8 are provided m a<br>
pool 100 and they share the responsibility for the control of,<br>
here, all the radio networks RAN1, ,RAN6 meaning that any FSN<br>
of the pool is able to control any of the radio networks. In<br>
this embodiment the functional server nodes are provided at<br>
two different sites, site 10 and site 20 respectively, for<br>
redundancy reasons, which is clearly advantageous if for<br>
example one site is destroyed e g. due to fire or sabotage Of<br>
course there may be more than two sites and it is of course<br>
also possible to keep all the functional server means at a<br>
single site. Other alternatives are also possible. In this<br>
embodiment FSN 1, , FSN 4 are provided at site 10 whereas FSN<br>
5, , FSN 8 are provided at site 20. It should be noted that in<br>
this case all the functional server nodes are provided in a<br>
common pool. It is also possible to have more than one pool<br>
depending for example on geographical and practical<br>
considerations. FSN 1, ,FSN 4 are connected to router R5 which<br>
in turn is connected to router R1 of the backbone network<br>
which is in direct or indirect communication with the other<br>
routers of the backbone, here R2, R3, R4. In a similar manner<br>
FSN 5, , FSN 8 are connected to router R6 at site 20 which in<br>
turn communicates directly with router R4 of the backbone<br>
network. The routers on the links of the backbone network as<br>
well as routers at the respective sites may be arranged in any<br>
appropriate manner. It is also possible to provide for<br>
redundant routers and links in the backbone network.<br>
Packet data gateway support nodes GW1, GW2, GW3 are provided<br>
for connection to external packet data networks such as<br>
Internet, intranets and corporate LANs. The connection to an<br>
external network can be done through one or more GW.s. If<br>
there are more than one gateway to an external network a<br><br>
selection of gateways is needed at each connection activation.<br>
The home location register HLR and domain name server DNS are<br>
connected to connectivity backbone via router R4, but they can<br>
of course be connected in any other appropriate manner<br>
The radio network control means RNC 11, , RNC 16 are<br>
responsible for selecting a functional server node when a<br>
subscriber connects/attaches to the network. Thus, when user<br>
equipment UEA initiates an attach or connect procedure to be<br>
attached to the network via a base station of RAN2, RNC 12,<br>
which controls RAN2, is responsible for selecting a functional<br>
server node FSN. In principle RNC 12 may select any of the<br>
FSNs of pool 100 to control the subscriber of user equipment<br>
UEA. It is here supposed<br>
that RNC 12 selects FSN 3 Advantageously the selection of FSN<br>
is done taking load sharing. FSN status etc. into<br>
consideration.<br>
The selection can be performed in different ways, for example<br>
a Weighted Round-Robin WRR selection method with reject<br>
possibility may be used This generally means that for each<br>
selected, i.e. for the next connecting subscriber, RNC 12<br>
would select for example FSN 4 A weighting factor in a WRR<br>
selection method may be a factor which takes the capacity<br>
(configured capacity) of each FSN server into account. The<br>
actual load on the FSN can also be included in the weighting<br>
factor as other factors as well. An FSN server may be provided<br>
with the possibility of rejecting a request by an RNC and then<br>
the RNC will try another FSN server node. In an advantageous<br>
implementation the selection method also includes the<br>
possibility to return information 1n a reject message, e.g.<br>
the cause for the rejection, the current load status of the<br>
concerned functional server node etc Advantageous each RNC<br>
keeps information about the status of the different FSN<br>
servers and inputs this to the selection algorithm.<br><br>
An RNC may keep information about which FSN server a user<br>
equipment station previously has used. This information can<br>
then be used when a detached user reattaches and the FSN be<br>
reused, which however not always is advantageous, and through<br>
the present inventive concept it is suggested how to<br>
transfer/redistribute mobile stations after such events (among<br>
others) . The information is preferably only stored m an RNC<br>
for a given time period, otherwise the storing capacity would<br>
have to be unnecessarily high and too old information is<br>
generally not useful.<br>
In one embodiment statistics relating to the number of rejects<br>
or reasons for rejections etc. by different FSN's is kept in<br>
the RNC.s. It is also possible to keep such information in an<br>
FSN or in both RNC and FSN. The information can be used to<br>
indicate the current capacity and to trigger a capacity<br>
increase. Which FSN that is allocated or selected for a<br>
particular subscriber or user station, is independent of where<br>
in the network the subscriber is. A change of FSN:s may<br>
however be needed if the subscriber or user station moves to<br>
other routing areas or radio networks, if the FSN needs to be<br>
taken down, is broken, if new sparsely loaded FSNs are<br>
introduced or if an MS is routed to the wrong FSN etc. as<br>
discussed above. The by FSN temporarily assigned user station<br>
(UE) identity (P-TMSI) is stored in the user station at detach<br>
and power off. Different ways to code FSN into user station<br>
identity can be used, e.g. by some bits identifying FSN etc.<br>
According to the pool/conglomerate concept, since all FSN<br>
servers (FSNs) have substantially the same or identical<br>
configuration, the operation and maintenance costs are much<br>
lower than in other systems and it also makes it easier to add<br>
more capacity e.g. through adding a new FSN. The parameter and<br>
software configurations of the FSN:s are advantageously more<br><br>
or less identical The hardware configuration may of course be<br>
different, capacity may differ etc.<br>
If there are more than one pool serving the network, then all<br>
FSN:s within a pool particularly have identical parameter and<br>
SW configuration. Since there are always alternative FSN:s<br>
that can be used if a complete node fails, redundancy on<br>
network level is obtained and the redundancy requirements on<br>
the FSNs themselves are less stringent than the requirements<br>
on server nodes/packet data support nodes in other systems.<br>
This is further emphasized through the<br>
redistribution/transferring capability concept according to<br>
the present invention. When the packet data support nodes are<br>
divided into two functional nodes, the functional server means<br>
(nodes) generally handle the control plane functionalities<br>
whereas the user gateway nodes handle the user plane<br>
functionalities<br>
In an advantageous embodiment, when an RNC has selected a<br>
functional server node FSN for a user station or a subscriber<br>
attaching to the network, the allocated or selected FSN is<br>
responsible for selection of a user gateway node. Particularly<br>
each FSN server within a pool can communicate with any user<br>
gateway node UGN in the network (or the part controlled by the<br>
pool) , and each user gateway node UGN can be used by any<br>
functional server node FSN in the network of the pool. The FSN<br>
may "select" the UGN connected to the RNC it communicates<br>
with; 1 e. by which it was selected (Then there is a 1:M<br>
relationship between user gateway node UGN and radio network<br>
control means RNC.)<br>
Alternatively an FSN may select UGN more freely. In one<br>
implementation an algorithm is used according to which the<br>
nearest UGN is tried first. Then there is a M:N relationship<br>
between UGN and RNC. This is advantageous in so far that is<br><br>
also provides for UGN redundancy. The UGN closest to the<br>
concerned RNC may e g. be selected first to minimize backbone<br>
capacity usage and if this UGN is not available or if it<br>
rejects the request, another UGN is selected In case of a<br>
reject, a weighted Round-Robin algorithm may be used to select<br>
an alternative UGN. If UGN is selected without restrictions,<br>
at least to some extent, or if more than one UGN is<br>
selectable, this provides for redundancy on a network level as<br>
far as functional user gateway nodes are concerned and there<br>
will always be an alternative UGN that can be used if a<br>
complete UGN fails. The redundancy requirements on such nodes<br>
will also be less stringent. It is also advantageous in that<br>
upgrading operations are facilitated e.g. when one UGN node is<br>
taken out of traffic. It may be an option to use the same UGN<br>
until deactivation or detachment.<br>
The selected functional server node may be responsible for<br>
selecting between several gateway nodes to external packet<br>
data networks such as for example Internet or an intranet for<br>
multi-homed APNs (Access Point Name). The nearest gateway node<br>
may be selected first or alternatively some algorithm may be<br>
used e.g.the weighted Round-Robin algorithm. In one particular<br>
implementation load and/or capacity considerations are<br>
included in the algorithm. Thus it can be provided for<br>
redundancy on network level also as far as gateway node to<br>
external network is concerned. There will always be<br>
alternative nodes to use if a complete gateway node fails and<br>
redundancy requirements will be less stringent on such nodes<br>
than in other systems It is also easy to upgrade such nodes<br>
e.g. by taking nodes out of traffic etc.<br>
In one particular implementation the packet data support nodes<br>
comprise SGSNs (Serving GPRS Support Node) which are divided<br>
or decomposed into an SGSN server node and a media gateway<br>
(MGW) and the gateway nodes GW comprise GGSN.s (Gateway GPRS<br><br>
Support Node). An UGN, or particularly a media gateway, may be<br>
connected to a router which is in connection with an RNC of<br>
the radio network and with a router of the IP backbone<br>
network In this way redundant MGWs are implemented.<br>
For explanatory reasons the splitting up of an SGSN node into<br>
an SGSN server and a media gateway MGW will be more thoroughly<br>
explained. An SGSN normally handles a large part of user and<br>
control plane functions. When split up, the SGSN server node<br>
will handle all the signalling interfaces (Gs, Gr, Gd etc ) as<br>
well as the GTP-C protocol whereas the MGW will handle the<br>
user traffic, and in particular the GTP-U protocol. Thus the<br>
load, m monolithic implementations supported by the SGSN,<br>
will in a split up architecture be distributed over two<br>
different network elements, e.g. SGSN server node and MGW. A<br>
new interface is introduced between SGSN server node and MGW.<br>
Particularly the functions of the SGSN server node are session<br>
management, mobility management, GTP-C termination, MAP<br>
termination, RANAP termination, CDR handling, media gateway<br>
selections, GGSN-selection, provision of intercept related<br>
information. The protocols referred to above, GTP-C, GTP<br>
Control Plane, GTP meaning GPRS Tunneling Protocol, MAP, RANAP<br>
(Radio Access Network Application Protocol) are discussed in<br>
3GPP, 3G TS 23.060 v3.4.0 (2000-07).<br>
It should be clear that the concept is also applicable for<br>
CGSNs which also may be pooled (in split with eg. a MGW or<br>
monolithic implementations).<br>
The media gateway node includes the functionalities of GTP-U<br>
(GTP User Plane) termination, collection of usage information<br>
for charging and network surveillance purposes, reporting of<br>
usage information on demand or event to the SGSN server node<br>
or other nodes, provision of content of communication etc.<br><br>
The MGW handles the user plane functionality for GPRS and<br>
terminates the GTP-U tunnels towards the GGSN over the GN and<br>
GP interfaces and towards the RNC over the Iu interface The<br>
MGW is controlled by the SGSN server.<br>
Fig. 2 shows another implementation of a system in which the<br>
inventive concept can be applied. It is here discussed with<br>
reference to UMTS, but it is generally applicable to any<br>
system and particularly any system wherein the protocol<br>
between the radio network and the packet data support node can<br>
be divided between control plane functionalities and user<br>
plane functionalities.<br>
SGSN server nodes are provided in two different pools, pool A<br>
100 and pool B 200 respectively. The functional server nodes,<br>
particularly SGSN server nodes 1A, 2A, 3A of pool A 100 are<br>
located at site 10AB whereas functional server nodes 4A, 5A, 6A<br>
of pool A 100 are located at site 20AB. Correspondingly<br>
functional server nodes 1B, 2B, 3B of pool B 200 are located<br>
at site 10AB whereas functional server nodes 4B, 5B, 6B of pool<br>
B 200 are located at site 20AB. Functional server means of one<br>
and the same pool are located at different sites for reasons<br>
of redundancy in case a site is destroyed, or is taken out of<br>
operation for some other reason, RNCs 112, 122, 132 are here<br>
controlled by pool A whereas RNCs 142, 152, 162 are controlled<br>
by pool B. Here all media gateways 212, 222, 232, 242, 252, 262<br>
are connected to routers R7, R8, R9, R10, Rll, R12<br>
respectively enabling the use of redundant media gateways. It<br>
should be noted that MGW 252 is connected both to RNC 152 and<br>
to Rll, which is an alternative that also could be represented<br>
elsewhere, of course Rll might be connected as e.g. R10. In<br>
other aspects the figure is similar to Fig. 1.<br>
It is possible to, instead of one pool at two sites (Fig. 1),<br>
or two pools sharing two sites, have one pool at one site<br><br>
only; however then redundancy is not as good, or two pools at<br>
only one site, three pools sharing two sites or three sites or<br>
any other convenient constellation. Particularly two or more<br>
sites may be co-located but still separate. Alternatively two<br>
sites have entirely different locations.<br>
The number of FSN-s (SGSN or CGSN servers) can be changed<br>
arbitrarily without affecting the network structure.<br>
Particularly, if the number of subscribers increases, simply<br>
more FSN:s (SGSN servers) are added - there is still no need<br>
to add UGN:s (MGW:s), RNC:s, BS s etc.<br>
Fig. 3 shows a network implementation to which the inventive<br>
concept can be implemented, a shared RAN with (here) two<br>
different operators, Operator 1, Operator 2 with each a Core<br>
Network, CN1, CN2. The shared RAN here comprises RNCs 113, 123,<br>
133 and a number of base stations etc. over which<br>
communication is provided with User Equipment UE as described<br>
in the foregoing.<br>
Fig. 3 illustrates a monolithic implementation and the FSN:s<br>
may comprise SGSNs/CGSNs<br>
As can be seen from Fig. 3, an operator (here Operator 2) may<br>
use a mix of shared and "own" RANs (RANX is here the "own" RAN<br>
with RNC 143 of Operator 2). An operator may also use only<br>
shared RANs, an example hereon is Operator 1.<br>
CN1 here comprises a conglomerate of FNSs, here FNS 1' , FSN<br>
2', FSN 3', FSN 4', FSN 5' of which FSN 2'- FSN 5' form part<br>
of a pool whereas TSN 1' is not pooled, but still assigned an<br>
NRI (Network Resourse Id) (in order to make routing in the<br>
shared RAN function).<br><br>
CN2 of Operator 2 also comprises a conglomerate of FSNs, here<br>
comprising a first pool, pool 1, comprising FSN 6', FSN 7',<br>
and a second pool, pool 2, here comprising FSNs, FSN 8', FSN<br>
9' and FSN 10' . A conglomerate is here taken to mean the FSN<br>
nodes of an operator. It may also comprise the FSN nodes of<br>
different operators. A shared RAN may be operated by a<br>
separate company, e.g a Radio Network Provider. It may of<br>
course also be run by Operator 1 or 2 or both.<br>
A conglomerate may e.g. also be taken to mean all FSNs 1'- 10'<br>
(i.e. FSNs of different operators) connected to an RNC<br>
connected to more than one FSN, thus requiring that the FSNs<br>
have unique NRIs (Network Resource Identifier).<br>
In Fig. 3 all FSNs are required to have a unique NRI. (An NRI<br>
is assigned to an FSN and provisioned to the MS when the MS is<br>
given a (P)-TMSI.)<br>
Fig. 4 is a sequence diagram illustrating the signalling flow<br>
(for packet switched communication) when a node, here current<br>
SGSN, requests/asks another node, target SGSN, to take over<br>
responsibility for a mobile station, MS.<br>
In a pool, each functional server node, here particularly each<br>
SGSN, has a unique identity, NRI (Network Resource<br>
Identifier) . The NRI is coded as a part of the mobile station<br>
(MS) P-TMSI, and it (NRI) is used by the radio network to<br>
route MS traffic to the correct SGSN in the pool.<br>
According to the present invention, the NRI of the first,<br>
current, as well as the NRI of the second, target, SGSN are<br>
encoded into the P-TMSI. This allows the second, target, SGSN<br>
to find the first, current, SGSN and perform a standard ISRAU<br>
(Inter SGSN Routing Area Update)<br>
Thus, according to the embodiment of Fig. 4 the procedure is<br>
as follows:<br><br>
1.	A RAU Request is received in the current SGSN from an MS<br>
within the SGSN pool area In one embodiment it is a periodic<br>
RAU request. Alternatively all RAU requests are "catched" (in<br>
order to be able to, once the decision (step 2) is taken, in<br>
the SGSN to keep control of the MS. At reception of<br>
registration requests, it is e.g. possible to set a timer with<br>
a very short time out period, e.g. 2 seconds. Service requests<br>
etc. are ignored. However, this relates to specific<br>
implementations and various alternatives are possible to keep<br>
control of an MS, e.g. that it does not move again etc. before<br>
the transfer is completed.<br>
2.	A decision is taken to move, or transfer, the context of<br>
the MS to the target SGSN. The decision may be taken by a<br>
person on an O&amp;M (Operation and Maintenance) level, or<br>
automatically e.g. by a pool supervising function e.g.<br>
monitoring the load on the nodes in the pool, malfunctionmgs<br>
etc. It may be a decision to move a number of MS contexts for<br>
some purpose or for some reason, or it may be a decision to<br>
move a specific mobile station context<br>
3 If the RAU is accepted (e.g. authentication is<br>
successful) a RAU accept message which is modified, as<br>
compared to conventional RAU accept messages, is generated<br>
The following data is encoded in the new P-TMSI to be sent to<br>
the MS: NRI of target SGSN, NRI of current SGSN and preferably<br>
a transfer indication, which particularly comprises the<br>
setting of a move or transfer bit (or bits) . Other<br>
alternatives are also possible. Particularly the NRI bits of<br>
the target SGSN are set in the "normal" or conventional<br>
position for NRI of the P-TMSI, whereas another position in<br>
the P-TMSI is used for NRI of the current SGSN. Preferably a<br>
timer, particularly the periodic RAU timer is set to a very<br>
low value, i.e. a short time period, e.g. 2 seconds. (Of<br><br>
course thxs value is only given as an example, it might be<br>
shorter as well as longer; the main thing being that it is<br>
considerably shorter than the "normal" value of the periodic<br>
RAU timer which may be about 1 hour. The RAU accept message is<br>
then sent to MS.<br>
For UMTS the follow-on flag should be ignored and the Iu<br>
connection released (otherwise messages will continue to be<br>
routed in RNC to the current SGSN and not to target SGSN as<br>
long as the Iu connection is active).<br>
For GSM force to standby could be used. When the MS has<br>
accepted the new P-TMSI all signalling for UMTS and all<br>
traffic (signalling and data) for GSM will be routed to the<br>
new target SGSN.<br>
4.	The MS will subsequently issue a periodic RAU request. If<br>
the periodic RAU timer has been set to a low value, the<br>
periodic RAU request will be issued shortly, after e.g. 2<br>
seconds, upon expiry of the timer, which is very advantageous,<br>
since it minimizes the risk that the MS will move or perform<br>
some action in the meantime, i.e. after the transfer decision<br>
has been taken, but before the transfer is completed. Since<br>
NRI of the target SGSN is known (included in the RAU Accept<br>
message) , the periodic RAU request will be routed to the<br>
target SGSN by the NRI routing functionality in the relevant<br>
RAN node (BSC/RNC).<br>
5.	The target SGSN comprises detecting means, e.g. comprised<br>
in the control means generating the modified acceptance<br>
message, and hence the incoming Periodic RAU request will be<br>
recognized as a RAU request from a mobile station selected for<br>
a context move operation. Particularly the detection is<br>
enabled through the transfer indication, although also other<br>
ways of detection are possible Target SGSN will perform an<br>
ISRAU<br><br>
6.	In the target SGSN, the NRI of the current SGSN is<br>
extracted from the P-TMSI of the MS (eg. also by the control<br>
means) and an SGSN Context Request is sent to the current<br>
SGSN.<br>
7.	The current SGSN then responds to the SGSN Context<br>
request<br>
8.	The target SGSN returns a Routing Area Update accept to<br>
the MS This message concludes the ISRAU procedure, and the<br>
periodic RAU timer is reset to a normal value<br>
The terminology etc. used in Fig 4 generally refers to packet<br>
switched communication.<br>
Fig. 5 is a sequence diagram similar to Fig. 4, but for<br>
circuit switched communication.<br>
It should be clear that, for implementation in PS as well as<br>
CS communication, the (re)setting of a timer with a short time<br>
out is not mdispensible, but advantageous.<br>
The different steps are similar from l'-4', with the<br>
difference that it relates to TMSI instead of packet TMSI (P-<br>
TMSI), and the terminology is different, here referring to<br>
Location Area update etc. However, in this case signalling<br>
with HLR (Home Location Register) is required. Actually, also<br>
for the PS case signalling with HLR is performed (as given in<br>
the 3GPP standards); this is however not illustrated in Fig.<br>
4. Thus, when target MSC has received "Location Area Update",<br>
4' from MS, a message 5', Update Location, is sent from MSC to<br>
HLR. Cancel Location message 6' is sent from HLR to current<br>
MSC, which sends an acknowledgment to HLR, 7'. HLR then<br>
requests target MSC to insert subscriber data, 8', which is<br>
acknowledged, 9' HLR subsequently sends an Update Location<br>
Acknowledgment, 10' , to taget MSC Target MSC subsequently<br>
sends a Location Area update Accept to MS, 11' . In other<br>
aspects it is referred to Fig 4<br><br>
Fig 6 shows one example of a P-TMSI in an acceptance message<br>
generated in a current functional server node. The "move bit"<br>
is set in P-TMSI and target NRI is set to the NRI of the<br>
second, target, SGSN, (the mobile station is not known in the<br>
target SGSN) . The NRI of the current SGSN is also included.<br>
The remainder of P-TMSI, and the whole acceptance message is<br>
preferably provided according to known, standardized manners,<br>
cf e.g TS 24.008 9.4.15 for GSM/GPRS and for WCDMA.<br>
The target SGSN can then use the transfer indication, e.g<br>
move bit, as an indication that an MS is being moved and look<br>
in the P-TMSI to find the NRI of the old (current) SGSN. The<br>
NRIs of the other SGSNs in the pool and their corresponding IP<br>
addresses are configured in the SGSN (this is a prerequisite<br>
to support the GTP Relay functionality). Together, this means<br>
that the target SGSN can find the current SGSN and trigger a<br>
standardised ISRAU procedure.<br>
The following factors together serve to identify that the<br>
signalling received in the target SGSN emanates from a mobile<br>
station that was selected in the current SGSN to have its<br>
context moved to the new SGSN: the "move bit" is set in the P-<br>
TMSI, the target NRI is set to the NRI of the target SGSN but<br>
the mobile is not known in the new (target) SGSN. The P-TMSI<br>
contains a valid NRI of another (current) SGSN in the SGSN<br>
pool m the prescribed position The incoming periodic RA<br>
update signal indicates an RA within the pool area.<br>
In a particularly advantageous embodiment it is possible for<br>
the target SGSN to identify an error situation that may occur<br>
during a move operation, specifically for GSM. The error that<br>
can occur is that the Routing Area Update Complete message<br>
from the MS can be routed to the target SGSN. This should not<br>
be the normal behaviour, this message should end up in the old<br><br>
(current) SGSN, but due to different interpretations (BSC<br>
implementations) of the Gb interface specification, 3GPP, this<br>
can happen.<br>
If this occurs, the target SGSN can make sure that a re-attach<br>
of the MS is not forced. Normal behaviour may be to trigger a<br>
re-attach at receipt of a Routing Area Update Complete message<br>
from an unknown MS in the target SGSN which would result m an<br>
unnecessary service interruption for the MS and end-user Due<br>
to the presence of the move bit and the target SGSNs NRI in<br>
the TTLI (Temporary Logical Link Identifier) this situation<br>
can be identified and handled by the target SGSN.<br>
It is an advantage of the invention that through setting the<br>
"move bit" and including the NRI of the (old) current SGSN in<br>
the P-TMSI of a mobile to trigger an ISRAU in the target (new)<br>
SGSN at the next periodic routing area update, unnecessay<br>
logic and communication between SGSNs involved m an MS<br>
context move operation can be avoided. This is of course also<br>
applicable for CGSNrs, MSC:s etc, in split as well as<br>
monolithic implementations<br>
Fig 7 is merely included to illustrate an example of a shared<br>
network which the inventive concept is applicable. It shows an<br>
embodiment with a shared network (shared RAN) in which a<br>
mobile station sends a registration request, 1, to RNC. If no<br>
NRI is available, or if NRI is unknown, RNC selects one<br>
operator (e.g. using Round-Robin). It should be clear that<br>
throughout the application it is referred to NRI, a domain<br>
selector or similar could alternatively be used (which is<br>
signalled from UE MS to RNC) . This is applicable for all<br>
embodiments. If Operator A cannot register the subscriber,<br>
Operator A sends a message to Operator B asking Operator B if<br>
Operator B can accept the subscriber, 2. If Operator B<br>
accepts, Operator B sends a response message to Operator A<br><br>
including a P-TMSI, 3 This message may also contain other<br>
information or parameters, e.g. the address (ID) to the SGSN<br>
that later should be used when fetching context etc. An Attach<br>
accept with the new P-TMSI, followed by a Network initiated<br>
Detach message, with a re-attach flag, is then sent to the<br>
terminal station, 4 The terminal station then sends a new<br>
registration request, 5, using the received new P-TMSI, which<br>
has an NRI pointing to Operator B, why the request is routed<br>
by RNC (using NRI, i.e. conventional Iu-flex functionality) to<br>
Operator B. (NRIs are coordinated between Operator A and<br>
Operator B) . Subsequently Operator B sends an Accept message<br>
to the terminal station, 6 This is a solution for the packet<br>
switched domain, and the handling can be said to be<br>
transparent to the RNC.<br>
It can be said to be an CN centric solution which with<br>
coordinated NRIs between the Operators implements normal Iu-<br>
flex routing in RNC. CN Operator selection is handled by CN in<br>
conjunction with the terminal station and there is a CS<br>
specific procedure to reallocate TMSI in MS and thereby move<br>
it to a new MSC, and a PS specific procedure to reallocate P-<br>
TMSI in MS and thereby move it to a new SGSN. There are two<br>
alternative ways for MSC/SGSN to obtain TMSI/P-TMSI to a<br>
target MSC/SGSN, namely by having a pre-allocated range of<br>
TMSIs/P-TMSIs to each cooperating operator, or by introducing<br>
new CN-CN signalling to ask cooperating operator's MSC/SGSN if<br>
it can accept the subscriber and exchange parameters. The CN<br>
Operator selection procedure can also be used for re-<br>
distribution of subscribers in a pool from one CN node to<br>
another, e.g. at node maintenance or load unbalance, or for<br>
other reasons as discussed above.<br>
For such a solution slightly different procedures are to be<br>
implemented for packet switched (PS) traffic and for circuit<br>
switched (CS) traffic respectively, as illustrated above.<br><br>
The steps for a PS procedure may be:<br>
If the Initial NAS (Non Access Stratum) (from MS,<br>
transparently through RNC to SGSN) message is an Attach<br>
request (WCDMA only):<br>
Get a new P-TMSI (pre-allocated or through signalling).<br>
Send an Attach accept (temporary) with the new P-TMSI to<br>
UE (terminal station)<br>
Send immediately after a Network initiated Detach<br>
request, with re-attach flag set.<br>
The UE re-attachs using the new P-TMSI (with another<br>
NRI) . The RNC routes the message to the right SGSN based<br>
on the NRI in the P-TMSI<br>
If the Initial NAS message is an RA Update*<br>
Get a new P-TMSI with NRI of current and target SGSN<br>
node.<br>
Send an RAU accept with the new P-TMSI to UE. Periodic<br>
timer =0 (or any other minimum value).<br>
Terminal station UE initiates a Periodic RAU, which is<br>
routed to the new SGSN (using NRI) and there handled as<br>
an Inter-SGSN RAU<br>
In order to minimize inter-operator signalling for a CN node<br>
selection procedure, the MSC/SGSN may be self-learning in what<br>
IMSI series are handled by what operators (with time-to-live)<br>
The CS specific procedure for reallocating TMSI, and thereby<br>
transfer an MS may comprise the steps of:<br>
Performing an IMSI analysis in MSC/SGSN and decide from<br>
pre-configured data which operator shall handle the<br>
subscriber. Telling the UE with TMSI reallocation that it<br>
shall use a specific NRI. This NRI is used exclusively<br><br>
for transferrxng UEs from Operator A to Operator B.<br>
Alternatively the NRI of the correct node of Operator B<br>
is included.<br>
With the next periodic Location Update or service-request<br>
routing of the UE to Operator B nodes it gets a new<br>
TMSI(NRI) so that the "transfer-NRI" will be free for<br>
other UEs to be transferred, (unless correct NRI already<br>
obtained).<br>
For the circuit switched domain	accordingly modified<br>
procedures are used This is however	not shown although the<br>
inventive concept with advantage can	be implemented also in<br>
this domain.<br>
Fig. 8 essentially describes, in a generalized manner, an<br>
embodiment similar to that of Fig. 4 in the form of a flow<br>
diagram. Thus, it is supposed that an area updating request is<br>
received from MSI in a first (current) packet data node FSN A,<br>
100. The area updating request is particularly a RAU. It may<br>
be (but it does not have to be) a periodic RAU request. Other<br>
alternatives are also possible. If a decision is taken, either<br>
in FSN A or in means associate therewith, in which case it is<br>
supposed that the decision is delivered to FSN A, that MSI for<br>
some reason is to be transfered to another target FSN, here<br>
FSN B, 101, an acceptance message consisting of an area update<br>
acceptance or a transfer acceptance (e.g. a RAU accept) is<br>
provided in FSN A, 102. This message comprises a new P-TMSI of<br>
MSI and it contains an identification (e.g. NRI) of FSN A as<br>
well as of FSN B, and in addition thereto a transfer<br>
indication.<br>
Preferably a timer is included and set to a low value, much<br>
lower than the periodic RAU timer, 103. Most particularly it<br>
is the periodic RAU timer that is reset to a low value. (The<br>
inclusion of the timer is not mdispensible, but clearly<br><br>
advantageous, since it makes MSI send a periodic routing are<br>
update request very soon, e.g. much earlier as provided for<br>
though the conventional RAU timer and hence reduces the risk<br>
that MSI moves or takes any action that might jeopardize the<br>
transfer operation).<br>
Hence, the acceptance message preferably with the timer with a<br>
low value, is sent to MSI from FSN A, 104. Upon expiry of the<br>
timer (if included otherwise at the subsequent, ordinary<br>
expiry of the RAU timer) MSI sends a periodic RAU to TSN 2,<br>
105. The fact that the identification of FSN B is included in<br>
the accptance message makes it possible for MSI to correctly<br>
send the periodic RAU request to FSN B. FSN B upon reception<br>
of the periodic RAU request extracts the identification of FSN<br>
A from P-TMSI included in the periodic RAU request, 106, and<br>
sends a context request (PDP context) to FSN A, 106, in a<br>
conventional manner. FSN A returns a context response to FSN<br>
B, 107, also in a conventional manner, and finally an area<br>
updating/transfer acceptance message is sent from FSN B to<br>
MSI, 108, and the ISRAU procedure is completed, i.e. it has<br>
been enabled to actually perform a standard ISRAU procedure.<br>
If a timer with a low value had been set, this is reset, or<br>
the periodic RAU timer is reset to the normal value.<br>
It should be clear that the invention is not limited to the<br>
specifically illustrated embodiments, but that it can be<br>
varied in a number of ways within the scope of the appended<br>
claims Particularly it is applicable for monolithic as well<br>
as split structures, SGSNs as well as on the PS side and e.g.<br>
for MSCs on the CS side.<br><br>
