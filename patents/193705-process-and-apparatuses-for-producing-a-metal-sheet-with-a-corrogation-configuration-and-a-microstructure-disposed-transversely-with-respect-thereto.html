The present invention concerns a process and apparatuses for producing a metal sheet with a corrugation configuration which is of a first predetermined corrugation height, wherein the sheet, transversely or at an angle to the corrugation, has a microstructure with a second, substantially smaller corrugation height. Metal sheets of that kind are processed in particular to form honeycomb bodies for catalytic converters as are used in particular in exhaust gas systems of motor vehicles. The invention however is not limited to that use as for example uses in heat exchangers are also possible.<br>
Details in regard to the form and the advantages of such microstructures are described for example in WO 90/08249 or WO 96/09892. As is already the case in the state of the art a microstructure in a corrugated sheet denotes a structure which is of substantially smaller height than the corrugation configuration of the sheet. In particular a microstructure can project from a sheet at one or both sides, more specifically for example by at least 15µ or 0.01 to about 0.3 times the corrugation height of the metal sheet.<br>
Corrugated metal sheets are generally produced in the state of the art by corrugation rollers which mesh with each other and which preferably have an involute tooth configuration or a tooth configuration of a similar design. Other corrugation shapes, for example a trapezium shape, a zig-zag shape etc. are however also known. In a honeycomb body through which exhaust gas flows, in particular in a catalytic converter, microstructures which extend transversely or inclinedly relative to the flow direction, so-called transverse structures (referred to as the TS-design), provide for a better transfer of heat between the exhaust gas and the honeycomb body and an improvement in the diffusion procedures which are important in regard to the catalytic effectiveness of the honeycomb body.<br>
The state of the art therefore provides for arranging microstructures at given spacings in succession in the flow direction, in particular at spacings of less than 20 mm and in particular less than 10 mm.<br>
As the microstructures were relatively small in comparison with the typical thickness of sheets for honeycomb bodies, it was hitherto assumed that they do not cause problems to a substantial degree in the further manufacturing procedure so that processing was effected using the usual corrugation rollers and moreover with known production steps for forming a honeycomb body.<br>
It has been found however that, when corrugating a sheet which already<br><br>
2<br>
has microstructures, those microstructures are in part pressed flat again, while in addition that also occurs irregularly, depending on the clearance of the corrugation rollers relative to each other. In that kind of production procedure the microstructures firstly had to be produced with a larger corrugation height than was wanted in the final result, in order to compensate for that effect. When dealing with quite a number of starting materials the cold shaping effects which occur in that situation could only be achieved with difficulty, without causing damage. That problem becomes more acute when dealing with ever thinner sheets and ever smaller corrugation heights. As in the meantime honeycomb bodies with for example 500 cells per inch2 (cpsi) and more are to be produced, in which case sheets down to a thickness of below 30 µm are also to be considered, more and more serious difficulties in terms of manufacturing procedure are encountered.<br>
Therefore the problem of the present invention is to provide a<br>
production process and a suitable apparatus with which corrugated metal<br>
sheets with microstructures extending transversely or inclinedly relative<br>
to the corrugation can be produced economically and without unacceptable<br>
cold deformation.	<br>
An apparatus and a process according to the present invention serve to solve that problem. <br>
The apparatus according to the invention for producing a metal sheet with a corrugation configuration which is of a first predetermined corrugation height, wherein the sheet has transversely or at an angle relative to the corrugation configuration a microstructure of a second, substantially smaller corrugation height, includes a device for producing the microstructure, a pair of mutually meshing corrugation rollers which are arranged downstream of the device for producing the microstructure, wherein the corrugation rollers have at their outer surfaces recesses which are suitably arranged and/or sufficiently large to receive the microstructures so that the microstructures are not deformed by the corrugation rollers when corrugating the metal sheet. Although the production of such a pair of corrugation rollers is relatively expensive, in particular for inclinedly extending microstructures, there is nonetheless the crucial advantage that microstructures can be produced with an exactly defined height which remains the same throughout, without very substantial cold shaping firstly having to be effected, which shaping later is partially pressed flat again by the corrugating procedure. Such an apparatus can therefore be used without difficulty in particular also for the production of microstructures in corrugated sheet metal layers of a thickness of for example 25 to 50 µm.<br><br>
3<br>
Typically corrugation rollers with a kind of involute tooth configuration are used, although the invention is not limited to that kind of rollers. In general all kinds of corrugation rollers have a certain degree of clearance relative to each other, whereby spacings which can only be reproduced with difficulty can occur at the flanks and/or on the peaks of the teeth or in the intermediate spaces during the teeth, during the production procedure. In the case of the corrugation rollers which are provided in accordance with the invention with recesses that clearance has no influence on the height of the microstructures.<br>
It is a particularly simple manner for the recesses to be in the form of grooves which should correspond in terms of their width and depth at least to the width and height respectively of the microstructures. It is however also possible for the microstructures to be possibly subsequently shaped again by suitably shaped grooves.<br>
It is also important in connection with the apparatus according to the invention that the device for producing the microstructure and the corrugation rollers are adjustable relative to each other in such a way that the microstructures produced always pass into recesses in the corrugation rollers. The easiest way of achieving that is to adopt a very close spatial arrangement, but that can also be achieved by means of suitable adjustment devices, if larger spacings are involved.<br>
Typically honeycomb bodies are formed from alternate layers of smooth and corrugated sheets or alternate layers of sheets corrugated in different ways, in which respect different design configurations are known, for example sheet layers which are wound in a spiral shape, twisted in an s-shape or twisted in the manner of an involute.<br>
If sheet metal layers of that kind which are disposed in mutually superposed relationship are to be welded or brazed together, the microstructures, depending on their respective height, can under some circumstances result in troublesome spacings between the sheet layers. The gaps between adjacent sheet layers, which are caused by the microstructures, can only be bridged over with difficulty by solder or brazing material, as from a given size of gap, and for that reason microstructures on the corrugation crests on both sides of the corrugated sheet layers may sometimes be undesirable. To deal with that situation, a particular embodiment of the apparatus according to the invention provides that arranged downstream of the corrugation rollers is at least one smoothing device which can press flat again the microstructures on the corrugation crests of the corrugated sheet, at one or both sides thereof. Such a device may be for example a corrugation roller with recesses, which runs against a flat roller. That procedure provides for pressing flat only microstructures on the corrugation crests, where they do not in any case<br><br>
4<br>
have influence on the flow which later flows in the honeycomb body, whereby bonding by means of solder or brazing material is substantially simplified. The other microstructures remain unchanged and can perform their intended function without further giving rise to problems in the production procedure.<br>
Alternatively it is also possible, instead of corrugation rollers and a smoothing device arranged downstream thereof, to use special corrugation rollers which do not have any recesses in their corrugation troughs, so that the microstructures can be pressed flat there. That can be particularly satisfactorily achieved if the corrugation rollers involve only a slight clearance between mutually oppositely disposed corrugation troughs and corrugation crests.<br>
The process according to the invention for producing a metal sheet with a corrugation configuration and a microstructure comprises the following steps:<br>
a) producing the microstructure in an initially uncorrugated metal<br>
sheet;<br>
b) feeding the metal sheet to a pair of mutually meshing corrugation<br>
rollers which have recesses arranged in the correct position in relation<br>
to the microstructures, for receiving the microstructures; and<br>
c) corrugating the sheet strip without pressing the microstructures<br>
flat.<br>
As already explained above that procedure gives rise to defined microstructures which are no longer deformed after they have been produced and which can therefore be formed in a very well-defined and reproducible manner. To avoid gaps between sheet metal layers which bear against each other and which are to be soldered or welded to each other, the microstructures on the corrugation crests on at least one of the two sides can be pressed flat in the corrugation rollers or in a subsequent smoothing device.<br>
Preferred embodiments of the invention and advantages thereof are<br>
described in greater detaiL hereinafter with reference to the drawings in<br>
which:	<br>
Figure 1 diagrammatically shows a corrugation apparatus according to the invention, and<br>
Figure 2 diagrammatically shows the production procedure according to the invention.<br>
Figure 1 shows the heart of the present invention, namely a corrugation device for metal sheets. A metal sheet 1 which has already been provided in a device for producing microstructures with downwardly facing microstructures 6 and upwardly facing microstructures 7 is fed to a pair of corrugation rollers 3a, 3b. At their surface the corrugation rollers<br><br>
5<br>
have recesses 8 which are in particular in the form of grooves. The recesses 8 of which only one is shown in the drawing receive the previously produced microstructures 6, 7 so that they are not affected by the corrugation process when corrugating the sheet. That results in a sheet which is corrugated with a first corrugation height A and which has corrugation crests 9, 10 at its top and bottom sides. The microstructures 6, 7 are substantially smaller in their height B than the first corrugation height A of the corrugated metal sheet 1.<br>
Figure 2 diagrammatically shows the production procedure for producing a corrugated sheet with microstructures. The metal sheet 1 first passes through a device 2a, 2b for producing the microstructure, as is known from the state of the art. In particular this may involve cylindrical rollers with corresponding surface structures or individual narrow disks which are arranged in a row with each other and which apply the microstructure to the metal sheet l by a cold shaping effect. The metal sheet 1 is then fed to a pair of corrugation rollers 3a, 3b, as are shown in greater detail in Figure 1. In the-situation where the microstructures are not wanted on the corrugation crests 9, 10 of the corrugated metal sheet 1, they can be smoothed by smoothing devices 4a, 4b and Sa, 5b respectively. Such smoothing devices comprise for example a cylindrical roller 4a and 5b respectively with a smooth surface, which runs against a corrugation roller 4b and 5a respectively, those corrugation rollers preferably having the same recesses as those which are used to produce the corrugation.<br>
Corrugated metal sheets produced in that way and provided with microstructures can be used in particular for honeycomb bodies in exhaust gas systems. They increase the transfer of heat between the honeycomb body and a fluid flowing therethrough and they accelerate diffusion phenomena, which is advantageous in particular in terms of the effectiveness of a catalytic converter.<br><br>
