				<td>Background of the Invention<br>
1.	Field of the Invention <br>
This invention relates generally to interconnection of electrical devices. In<br>
particular, this invention relates to detection of and response to errors in interconnection of<br>
electrical devices.<br>
II.	Description of Related Art<br>
In electrical systems wherein devices are interconnected via cabling having<br>
substantially similar coupling connectors, it is known to provide physical keying elements to<br>
prevent incorrect mating of connector components. In general, the number of useable<br>
arrangements of physical keying elements is very limited and they are susceptible of<br>
failure of their intended purpose through loss or damage. It is also known to provide<br>
particular electrical contact elements for device identification in a plurality of connectors<br>
interconnected in electrical paralleI (as in an electrical bus structure). Such arrangements<br>
are well known in computer equipment where plural devices are interconnected over a<br>
common electrical bus. In industrial apparatus such as equipment heating systems,<br>
heating devices are widely separated from their controllers and operate at high voltages at<br>
relatively high currents. In applications wherein equipment is routinely replaced, such as<br>
tooling assemblies for molding equipment, it is advantageous to provide connectors<br>
interposed between heaters and controllers. In such systems, similarities in connectors<br>
make it possible to interconnect devices and controllers contrary to a desired<br>
interconnection. Hence, there is a need to provide detection of instances of undesired<br>
interconnection of electrical devices and to effect a response to detection of<br>
interconnection errors.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
It is an object of the present invention to detect undesired interconnection of<br>
electrical devices and provide a response thereto.<br>
It is a further object of the present invention to detect undesired interconnection of<br>
electrical devices wherein plural devices are interconnected by plural coupling connectors,<br>
each connector comprising mating components wherein there is a desired interconnection<br>
of mating components to achieve a desired interconnection of devices and provide a<br>
response to the detection of undesiredinterconnection.<br><br>
It is a still further object cf the present invention to detect undesired interconnection<br>
of electrical devices wherein plural devices are interconnected by plural coupling<br>
connectors, each connector comprising mating components wherein there is a desired<br>
interconnection of mating components to achieve a desired interconnection of devices, and<br>
wherein mating components include identification elements for producing identification<br>
signals, and decoding means decode the identification signals and diagnostic means<br>
detect interconnection errors anc means responsive to detection of interconnection errors<br>
generate an alarm when the actual interconnection of devices differs from the desired<br>
interconnection of devices.<br>
It is a still further object of the present invention to provide interconnection of<br>
electrical devices wherein plural electrical heaters are connected to plural controllers, the<br>
controllers, and interposed between the heaters and the controllers are plural coupling<br>
connectors, each connector comprising mating components wherein there is a desired<br>
interconnection of mating components to achieve a desired interconnection of heaters and<br>
controllers, and wherein mating components include identification elements for producing<br>
identification signals, and decodirg means decode the identification signals and diagnostic<br>
means detect interconnection errors and an interlock responsive to the diagnostic means<br>
prevents application of power to the heaters when the actual interconnection of heaters<br>
and controllers differs from the desired interconnection of heaters and controllers.<br>
It is a further object of the present invention to provide interconnection of electrical<br>
devices wherein plural electrical heaters are connected to plural program controlled<br>
controllers by a plurality of coupling connectors, each coupling connector comprising<br>
mating components wherein there is a desired interconnection of mating components to<br>
achieve a desired interconnection of heaters and controllers, and mating components<br>
include identification elements for producing identification signals, decoding means decode<br>
the identification signals and means responsive to the decoding means alter programming<br>
of the controllers to effect operation of the heaters according to the desired interconnection<br>
of heaters and controllers irrespective of the actual interconnection of mating components.<br>
Further objects and advantages of the invention shall be made apparent from the<br>
accompanying drawings and the following description thereof.<br>
In accordance with the aforesaid objects the present invention improves<br>
interconnection of electrical devices wherein a desired interconnection of devices is<br>
achieved by an intended interconnection of mating components of coupling connectors.<br>
Identification elements in one mating component of each connector produce identification<br>
signals representing identity of the mating component; decoding means responsive to the<br><br>
identification signals produce an error signal representing an interconnection of connector<br>
components differing from the intended interconnection; and, means responsive to the<br>
error signal effects a response when the actual interconnection of components differs from<br>
the intended interconnection of components. Responses are, advantageously, activation of<br>
an alarm indicator, inhibition of application of power to affected devices, or, with program<br>
controlled systems, display of a text error message, facilitation of user intervention for error<br>
correction, or automated re-programming to overcome interconnection errors.<br>

Detailed Description of the Preferred Embodiment<br>
The invention shall be illustrated with reference to a preferred embodiment which<br>
shall be described in detail. It is not the intention of applicant that the invention be limited<br>
to the preferred embodiment, but rather that the invention shall be defined by the<br>
appended claims and all equivalents thereof.<br>
Elementary Controllers<br>
Referring to Fig. 1, a mold assembly 10 comprises mold halves 12 and 14 defining<br>
mold cavities 16 and 18 along the parting line of the mold halves. Cavities 16 and 18<br>
determine the shape, size and fin sh of articles to be molded using mold assembly 10.<br>
Molding is effected by introduction of flowable material into cavities 16 and 18 through<br>
nozzles 20 and 22 respectively, solidification of the flowable material, and separation of<br>
mold halves 12 and 14 to permit removal of the finished articles. Flowable material is<br>
introduced to mold assembly 10 at inlet 24 and is directed through channels 26 and 28 to<br>
nozzles 20 and 22. The flowable material may be molten material, a curable slurry<br>
comprising self binding solids, or reactants that when combined produce a reaction<br>
product that solidifies by, for example, chemical reaction. Examples of molten materials<br>
include thermoplastics and metals In connection with the preferred embodiment, it shall be<br>
presumed that the material to be molded is thermoplastic.<br><br>
Continuing with reference to Fig. 1, it will be understood that complete filling of<br>
cavities 16 and 18 is essential to producing articles of acceptable quality. Hence, it is<br>
desirable to maintain the flowable condition of the material from inlet 24 through nozzles<br>
20 and 22 to cavities 16 and 18. With thermoplastic material, it may be necessary to<br>
replace heat lost from the material (the so-called "melt") to maintain the desired flowable<br>
condition. Hence, heaters 30, 32,34,36 and 38 are provided to transfer heat to the melt at<br>
inlet 24 and in channels 26 and 28. Inlet 24, nozzles 16 and 18, channels 26 and 28, and<br>
heaters 30 - 38 comprise a so-called "hot runner system". The hot runner system is<br>
intended to maintain a desired flowable condition of melt from inlet 24 through nozzles 20<br>
and 22. Although not shown in Fig. 1, known "hot runner systems" may include a<br>
combination of electrical heaters and heat transfer fluid conduits with flow controllers such<br>
as electrically operated valves.<br>
Continuing with reference: to Fig. 1, heaters 30 - 38 convert electrical energy to<br>
heat. Electrical power applied to heaters 30 - 38 determines the amount of heat produced.<br>
To regulate the application of power, temperature proximate the heaters is sensed by<br>
sensors 40, 42, 44, 46, and 48. Temperature sensors may be thermocouples or remote<br>
temperature detectors as are wel known. Each combination of a heater and sensor<br>
defines a "zone" for regulation of applied power. Each of controllers 50, 52, 54, 56, and 58<br>
are interconnected with a combination of a neater and sensor to control application of<br>
power to a zone. Each of controllers SO - 58 controls electrical energy delivered from<br>
source 60 to the attached heater in accordance with sensed temperature and a desired<br>
temperature for the zone. Electrical energy from source 60 may be alternating current, as<br>
indicated in Fig.1 or may be direct current. As is well known for control of power applied to<br>
a load, controllers 50 - 58 advantegeously include solid state switching devices that are<br>
controllably conductive to transfer electrical energy from source 60 to heaters 30 -38.<br>
As it is commonly desirable that molding assemblies and applied hot runner<br>
systems be readily exchangeable in the press portion of a molding machine, it is<br>
advantageous to provide coupling connectors to provide interconnections between<br>
controllers 50 - 58 and the hot runner system. While shown in Fig. 1 as separate<br>
connectors 70 - 78 for five zones, c onductors for plural zones may be combined at a<br>
single connector. Each of connectos 70 - 78 comprises mating components, designated<br>
"A" and "B" in Fig. 1. The mating components are conventional and may be constructed<br>
wherein one mating component provides projecting conductive pins and the other provides<br>
conducting receptors for the pins. Each of the pins and receptors terminates a conductor<br>
at the mating component. With components A and B fitted together, the projecting pins of<br><br>
one component are inserted in the receptors of the other providing a conductive<br>
connection by which the conductors are interconnected. As is conventional, such<br>
components are suitable for repeated interfitting and separation without loss of the quality<br>
of the electrical connection achieved through the connectors. Other constructions of<br>
mating components are well known and may be used in the practice of the invention.<br>
In the practice of the invention for hot runner systems, connectors 70 - 78 are<br>
proximate mold assembly 10. Conductors from heaters 30 - 38 and sensors 40 - 48 are<br>
terminated at the B components of connectors 70 - 78. Conductors from controllers 50 -<br>
58 are terminated at the A components of connectors 70 - 78. As illustrated in Fig. 1 all of<br>
connectors 70 - 78 are substantially similar in size and configuration and would permit<br>
fitting together of any of the B components with any of the A components. The invention<br>
contemplates that elements that serve to connect identification signals representing the<br>
particular connector will be included in each of the A and B components. Identification<br>
could simply be represented by the presence or absence of a single signal out of a number<br>
of signals. For example, for five connectors, each would include five elements for<br>
identification signals, a single element carrying a signal distinct from the other four at each<br>
connector. It is not necessary that the identification signal carrying elements be arranged<br>
in any particular physical pattern or occupy particular locations in the connector<br>
components. It is necessary that the identification signal carrying elements be uniformly<br>
arranged in all connectors of a single system to insure the identification signals will appear<br>
at the same elements of each component.<br>
As is well known, identification signals may be advantageously represented by<br>
combinations of ground and a signal voltage such as a low level direct current voltage.<br>
Hence, to produce a desired combination of identification signals at a connector<br>
component, the identification sigr al carrying elements may be connected as appropriate to<br>
respectively, ground or signal voltage. Connections of the ground and signal voltage to the<br>
connector elements may be effected at a connector component using minimal length<br>
conductors ("jumpers") between c onnector elements or between conductors attached to<br>
the connector elements; by switches to which the identification elements are connected;<br>
or, by a coded switch to which the identification elements are connected. As the A<br>
components of connectors 70 - 78 terminate conductors from controllers 50 - 58, signal<br>
voltage and ground is advantagec usly supplied from sources proximate controllers 50 - 58<br>
to the A components. Connections of identification signal carrying elements at the B<br>
components to the respective ground and signal voltage is advantageously made by<br>
jumpers at the B components. In such an arrangement, the identification signals produced<br><br>
by interconnection of the A and 8 components are then available via conductors from the<br>
A components to a remote decoder such as decoder 62 proximate controllers 50 - 58.<br>
It will be appreciated that for more than a few connectors, the use of single<br>
identification signals in a "one cf N" representation is inefficient in respect of use of<br>
connector elements for identification. Conversely, identification signals representing, for<br>
example, a binary code, require fewer component elements to uniquely identify the same<br>
number of connectors. For exanple, using a binary code, up to two connectors require a<br>
single identification element in each connector; up to four connectors require two<br>
identification elements in each connector; up to eight connectors require three<br>
identification elements in each connector; and, up to 16 connectors require four<br>
identification elements in each connector (see Table 1). The examples of Table 1 are<br>
readily susceptible of extension to any number of connectors and associated binary codes<br>
and the invention is not limited in its applicability to a predetermined number of connectors.<br>
Use of a binary code dramatically reduces the number of required connector elements<br>
required for identification signals as compared to "one of N" representations.<br><br>
Irrespective of the nature of the identification signals, it is desired to determine that<br>
the interconnection of A and B components of connectors 70 - 78 is as desired. This is<br>
achieved by decoding and/or comparison of the identification signals generated at the B<br>
component to signals representing an intended or expected connector identification. For<br>
identification signals wherein one of several is unique, comparison of only a single signal<br>
for each connector is required. For identification signals representing a binary code, the<br>
comparison may be done for plural signals using known binary comparator circuitry. In {he<br>
case of a four bit binary code, comparison may be made by a four bit comparator,<br><br>
indicating equality or inequality of the identification code and the desired code. In such an<br>
arrangement, absence or presence of equality constitutes a single binary indicator of an<br>
interconnection error of A and B components. Alternatively, the identification code may be<br>
decoded to a single signal representing the particular connector component. For example<br>
a four bit binary code can be decoded to one signal representing any one of sixteen<br>
possible combinations of the four binary digits using known binary decoding circuitry. After<br>
such decoding, only a single o jtput of the decoder need be compared to the appropriate<br>
signal to detect interconnectior errors. The results of the comparisons for all connectors<br>
can be combined logically or sequentially to produce a single signal indicating whether or<br>
not the actual interconnection of A and B components is as desired. As used herein and in<br>
the appended claims, "decoding" shall include comparison to detect equality as well as<br>
detection of one of a number of possible combinations ("one of N") of the identification<br>
signals and shall include decoding followed by comparison as described and the terms<br>
"decoder" or "decoding means" shall mean devices and/or combinations of devices<br>
suitable for performing such "decoding". Further, where "decoding" is effected for plural<br>
sets of identification signals sequentially, the decoding means shall be understood to<br>
include means for storing detection of an interconnection error until the error condition is<br>
corrected.<br>
In the event actual interconnection of A and B components does not correspond to<br>
the intended interconnection, i.e., actual interconnection is erroneous, it is desirable to<br>
respond so as to protect the interconnected equipment from undesired operation.A<br>
response contemplated by the present invention is to actuate an indicator that there is an<br>
equipment abnormality. A further response contemplated by the present invention is that<br>
power not be applied to at least those of heaters 30 - 38 that are not interconnected with<br>
the desired ones of controllers 50 - 58. As described, the decoding means produces an<br>
error signal indicating an interconnection of A and B components that is in error, labeled<br>
"NORMAL" in Fig. 1. In general, a response is effected by means responsive to the error<br>
signal. The NORMAL signal of Fig. ! is, advantageously false, when an interconnection<br>
error exists. As an example of a first contemplated response, the error signal may be used<br>
to control an audible or visible indicator or alarm 68 so that when "NORMAL" is false the<br>
indictor or alarm is activated. As an example of a second contemplated response, the<br>
NORMAL signal is advantageously applied to inhibit application of power through the<br>
affected controllers to the affected heaters. For example, the NORMAL signal may be<br>
applied to a coil, such as coil 64 of Fig. 1, of an electromagnetic relay having normally<br>
open contacts 66 connected betweer source 60 and controllers 50 - 58. When the<br><br>
NORMAL signal is true, the relay is actuated, contacts 66 are closed, and power is<br>
conducted. In such an arrangement, until relay coil 64 is energized by the NORMAL signal,<br>
power is not applied to any of heaters 30 - 38.<br>
F rogram Controlled Systems<br>
Application to a hot runnor system including program controlled heater controls<br>
shall be described with reference to the block diagram of Fig. 2. Elements of Fig. 2<br>
corresponding to elements of Fig. 1 are shown with the same reference numbers. A<br>
programmable control 100 comprises memory 104, a processor 106, and input and output<br>
interface circuits such as power interface circuits 108, and decoder 62, all of the foregoing<br>
interconnected by, for example, one or more busses to transfer data and addresses. An<br>
operator terminal 112 includes a display 114 and input devices such as keys 116. Operator<br>
terminal 112 permits display of dsta retrieved from memory 104 or created using keys 116<br>
and entry of data to memory 104. Operator terminal 112 may be dedicated to control 100<br>
or may be a portable device which is connected with control 100 only as needed for, for<br>
example, set up or maintenance of control 100. Processor 106 is a program controlled<br>
device which executes operating system programs 120 to effect control of devices<br>
connected to the control busses and to effect control of execution of other programs<br>
recorded in memory 104. Operating system programs 120 include mode control programs<br>
122 which control the selection of control programs available for execution according to the<br>
operator determined mode of operation of the control, and workstation programs 124<br>
which support exchanges of data with operator terminal 112.<br>
Interface circuits 108 comprise, at least, plural independently controllable devices<br>
for delivering power from source 6C to heaters 30 - 38. Control of these devices is effected<br>
by program control effected by processor 106 executing programs, such as temperature<br>
control programs 130. Although represented n Fig. 2 by a single block, processor 106 may<br>
be a combination of plural processors, some of which serve primarily to support input and<br>
output of data between memory 104 and operator terminal 112 and others serving<br>
primarily to effect control of devices Of interface circuits 108. In particular, processor 106<br>
may include a plurality of independent processors associated with power interface circuits<br>
108. Likewise, while memory 104 is represented in Fig. 2 by a single block, memory 104<br>
may be a combination of plural memory devices, some of which serve primarily to store<br>
programs and data associated with functions involving operator terminal 112 and other<br><br>
devices serving to store programs and data associated with control of devices of interface<br>
circuits 108. In particular, memory 104 may include a plurality of independent memory<br>
devices associated with power interface circuits 108. Further, decoder 62 may comprise<br>
plural decoders associated with plural power interface circuits, each decoder effective to<br>
detect normal interconnectior of at least one pair of A and B components of connectors 70<br>
-78.<br>
Program control of heaters 30 - 38 is effected in a "normal" or "automatic" mode of<br>
operation selected by the operator. Power applied to the heaters in this mode is controlled<br>
by execution of temperature control programs 130. Control of the hot runner system is<br>
effected by execution of, for example, a set up program 126 for establishing set point<br>
values used to control zone heating, and steady state algorithm programs 128 to maintain<br>
zone temperatures at desired values. A source of electrical energy 60 is connected to<br>
power interface circuits 108. Power interface circuits 108 may comprise plural independent<br>
program controlled devices (combinations of processors and memory), each effecting<br>
control of electrical energy appled to one of heaters 30 - 38 to maintain sensed<br>
temperature within a working tolerance of the applicable temperature set point. Equivalent<br>
operation can be achieved wherein a single program controlled device (combination of<br>
memory and processor) evaluates plural algorithms and sequentially produces plural<br>
control signals, one to control pcwer applied from source 60 to each of heaters 30 - 38.<br>
Irrespective of whether power interface circuits 108 comprise plural program controlled<br>
processors, each interface circuit of power interface circuits 108 advantageously comprise<br>
switching devices, advantageously solid state switching devices, which are controllably<br>
conductive to transfer electrical energy from source 60 to heaters 30 - 38.<br>
To effect program control, processor 106 executes programs to evaluate control<br>
algorithms relating, for example, set point values, sensed values and controlled values.<br>
Plural algorithms may be employed to effect control of power applied to a single heater<br>
according to, for example, applicable conditions of the hot runner system. Hence, different<br>
algorithms may be employed for control under "start-up", "steady-state", and "idle"<br>
operation of any of heaters 30 - 38. Each program controlled device is responsive to, at<br>
least, a temperature set point to evaluate a control algorithm to control power applied from<br>
source 60 to one of heaters 30 - 38. Advantageously, at least one program controlled<br>
device is responsive to a temperature set point and sensed temperature as determined by<br>
one of temperature sensors 40 - 48, to control power applied to one of heaters 30 - 38. In<br>
accordance with the nature of the control algorithm used, set point values may be defined<br>
for: (i) temperatures for cold start up, normal, and idle operation; (ii) limits of electrical<br><br>
current delivered to the connected heater; (iii) control algorithm parameters such as gain<br>
(proportional constant), integral constants and differential constants; (iv) load resistance;<br>
(v) load power; (vi) thermal response lag time; and, (vii) average power to maintain<br>
temperature set point. Other data not needed for evaluation of a control algorithm, but<br>
relevant to the zone may also be stored as set points, such as for example, identification<br>
data for replacement parts for zone components. Set point values are associated with<br>
each zone, each zone having a unique identifier such as a number. Set point data are<br>
advantageously stored to permit retrieval using an index defined by an appropriate zone<br>
identifier.<br>
The program controlled s/stem of Fig.2 provides facilities suitable for supporting<br>
various responses to detection of interconnection errors. The program controlled system of<br>
Fig. 2 can activate an alarm indicator at operator terminal 12, effect display of an<br>
interconnection error message on display 114, enable use of terminal 112 in a set up<br>
procedure to enable operator intervention to correct interconnection errors, or effect<br>
automated re-programming to overcome interconnection errors. A procedure for<br>
interconnection error diagnosis w II be described with reference to Fig. 3 and procedures<br>
for lead-through set up and for automated re-programming will be described with reference<br>
to Figs. 4a and 4b respectively.<br>
The flow chart of Fig. 3 represents a diagnostic procedure advantageously<br>
executed with initiation of an automatic mode of operation. At decision step 150 indication<br>
of undesired interconnection of A and B components is detected by examination of the<br>
value of the NORMAL output of decoder 62. As previously described, decoder 2 can be<br>
implemented to produce a logical result of simultaneous comparison of identification<br>
signals for all connectors or may be implemented to store instances of detection of<br>
interconnection errors where comparisons of identification signals are performed<br>
sequentially. It is only necessary that the NORMAL signal indicate an interconnection error<br>
until all interconnection errors have been corrected or overcome. In the event the<br>
"NORMAL" output represents an undesired interconnection, at process step 152 the<br>
procedure selects a connector for which an undesired interconnection is detected as<br>
represented by "C(ID(E))" where "(D(E)" is the identification value for a connector where an<br>
interconnection error was detected. The selected connector identification defines an index<br>
"I" for selecting sets of data associated with the selected connector, including: an intended<br>
(expected) connector identification value ("IC(I)") corresponding to the identification of a<br>
connector expected to be connected with the selected connector and an actual connected<br>
connector identification ("AC(I)") corresponding to the identification of the connector<br><br>
actually connected to the selected connector. At process step 154, the actual identification<br>
signals at the B component of the selected connector ("SC(I)") are retrieved to establish<br>
the actual connector identification "AC(I)". At process step 156, the selected connector<br>
identification ("SC(I)") and the actual connector identification ("AC(I)") are saved as an<br>
associated pair. At decision step 158, it is determined whether the index "I" is equal to the<br>
limit "LIM" representing the total number of connectors. If not, processing continues at step<br>
152 where the index "I" is updated to the next connector identification for which an<br>
interconnection error has been detected by decoder 62, Processing continues in a loop<br>
from step 152 through decision step 158 until the selected connector identification and<br>
actual connector identification data pairs have been saved for all connectors for which<br>
interconnection errors have been detected. Thereafter execution continues at process step<br>
1.60 where saved connector identification pairs for all connectors for which interconnection<br>
errors have been detected are presented on display 114.<br>
In addition to the connector identification pairs, displays are presented at display<br>
114 indicating alternatives on which the operator may choose to proceed. In particular, the<br>
operator may choose Auto Correct to effect automated reprogramming of data associated<br>
with undesired interconnections, or Set UP to effect manual reprogramming of data<br>
associated with undesired interconnections and/or manual re-connection of connector<br>
components to the intended connection. Operator selection of Set Up from terminal 112<br>
initiates execution of a Set Up procedure illustrated by the flow chart of Fig. 4a. Operator<br>
selection of Auto Correct initiates execution of an automated re-programming procedure<br>
illustrated by the flow chart of Fig.2.b.<br>
Those steps of a Set Up procedure comprising interactive facilitation of user<br>
intervention to selectively correct and overcome interconnection errors are illustrated by<br>
the flow chart of Fig. 4a. At process step 170 data for a selected connector for which an<br>
interconnection error was detected are displayed, including the selected connector<br>
identification ("SC(l)") and associated zone identifiers (numbers) and the identification of<br>
the actual connected B component "AC(I)") together with associated zone numbers. At<br>
process step 172 data entry is prompted at display 114, by, for example, highlighting a<br>
zone number of the actual connected connector. To facilitate manual reprogramming, the<br>
operator may enter the zone numbers of the actual connected connector to replace the<br>
zone numbers associated with the selected connector. Set point data associated with the<br>
zone numbers is not changed by the reassignment of zone numbers. Hence, set point data<br>
associated with zones of the actual connected connector remain in place. Data entries are<br>
effected with operation of an "Enter" key at terminal 112. Decision step 174 detects<br><br>
operation of the "Enter" key. Skipping of a selected connector may be effected by<br>
operation of an "Escape" key. Decision step 176 detects operation of the "Escape" key.<br>
To overcome the interconnection error, the operator may replace zone numbers as<br>
described or change the actual interconnection to the expected interconnection. In the<br>
event data entries are made, decision step 178 determines whether the intended<br>
connector identification and the actual connector identification associated with the selected<br>
connector are equal. To eliminate detection of an interconnection error, the identification of<br>
the actual connector ("AC(I)") and the intended connector identification ("IC(I)") must<br>
agree. Hence, until the operator has entered an intended connector identification equal to<br>
the actual connector identificatior associated with the selected connector, decision step<br>
178 will continue to redirect execution of the procedure of Fig. 4a to process step 172 to<br>
prompt data entry, notwithstanding that zone numbers associated with the selected<br>
connector have been replaced.<br>
Proceeding from decision step 178, execution of the procedure of Fig. 4a continues<br>
at decision step 180 where it is determined whether the index "I" is equal to a limit value<br>
"LIM" corresponding to the total number of connectors. If not, execution continues at<br>
process step 170 where the connector identification is selected for the next connector for<br>
which an interconnection error was detected. Once the index "I" has reached the limit<br>
value, execution of the procedure of the flow chart of Fig. 4a is complete and execution<br>
ends at terminal 182. It is to be understood, that in the event of an interconnection error,<br>
there can be no less than two instances of detection of a difference between the actual<br>
connector identification ("AC(I)") and the intended connector identification ("IC(I)"). Hence,<br>
to overcome the interconnection error by re-programming it is necessary to re-program<br>
zone identifiers for pairs of selected connectors corresponding to the connectors for which<br>
mating components have been switched. The loop from decision step 180 through process<br>
steps 170 insures that required re-programming will be prompted.<br>
Should the operator not wish to alter programming for a selected connector, a<br>
different connector may be selected by operation of the Escape key. On detection of<br>
operation of the Escape Key execution continues at decision step 180 from which<br>
execution may continue or end according to the value of the index "I", as herein described.<br>
In the Set Up mode, outputs of inteface circuits 108 are advantageously inhibited,<br>
including inhibiting application of power to heaters 30 - 38. Hence re-connection of<br>
connectors 70 - 78 may be effected without hazard to personnel or equipment. Use of<br>
"Escape" permits the operator to control execution of the Set Up procedure under the<br>
circumstances that manual re-connection is contemplated to eliminate at least some<br><br>
interconnection errors. Once the execution of the Set Up procedure of Fig. 4a ends, the<br>
operator may initiate operation of automatic mode, causing re-execution of diagnostic<br>
routines 130 prior to application of power to heaters 30 - 38.<br>
Automated re-programming to overcome interconnection errors may be effected in<br>
accordance with a procedure illustrated by the flow chart of Fig. 4b. At process step 190,<br>
the connector index "I" is set equal to the connector identification of a connector for which<br>
an interconnection error has been detected. At process step 191 the selected connector<br>
and actual connector identification values are retrieved from the data saved at process<br>
step 156 of Fig. 3 for the connector selected at process step 190. At process step 192<br>
zone identifiers (numbers) ("AZ(I)") associated with the actual connector are set into the<br>
memory to replace the zone ider tifiers association with the selected connector ("SZ(I)"). At<br>
process step 194 the identificatic n signals for the intended (expected) connector ("IC(I)")<br>
associated with the selected con lector ("SCO)") are replaced with the identification signals<br>
for the actual connector ( "AC(I)")<br>
As a consequence of process step 194, decoder 62 will not detect an undesired<br>
interconnection for the selected c onnector ("SC(I)"). Following execution of step 194,<br>
execution of the procedure of Fig. 4b continues at decision step 196 where it is determined<br>
whether the zone index is equal to a limit value "LIM" equal to the number of connectors. If<br>
not, execution of the procedure continues in a loop beginning with process step. 190 to<br>
reprogram zone identifiers and in:ended connector identifications for all of the connectors<br>
for which interconnection errors (' E(ID)") were detected. Once all re-programming is<br>
complete, process step 198 returns control of execution to the automatic mode of<br>
operation to begin controlled heating. As with the Set Up procedure, resumption of<br>
automatic operation begins with execution of the diagnostic routines 130 prior to<br>
application of power to heaters 3C - 38.<br>
To illustrate reprogramming effected by the procedure illustrated by Fig. 4, an<br>
example will be described with reference to Fig. 2. It will be understood that with all<br>
components of connectors 70 - 78 mated, there can be no fewer than two undesired<br>
interconnections. For the example it will be presumed that actual interconnection of A and<br>
B components of connectors 70 and 78 resulted in interconnection of a power interface<br>
circuit intended for heater 32 with heater 34 and a power interface circuit intended for<br>
heater 34 with heater 32, It will fur her be assumed that in all respects other than set points<br>
used for evaluation of the control aIgorithms, the control effected by the interface circuits<br>
for heaters 34 and 32 are substantially identical. As a result of the undesired<br>
interconnection, the NORMAL output of decoder 62 will indicate an interconnection error.<br><br>
The saving of identifications for the affected connectors is accomplished by the steps of<br>
Fig.3 beginning with decision step 150 and continuing through process step 156. The<br>
saved selected connector identifications ("SC(I)") and actual connector identifications<br>
("AC(l)") will correspond to the identifications for connectors 70 and 78. Steps 190 through<br>
194 of Fig.4b effect re-programming of zone identifiers associated with connectors so that<br>
set points intended for use with ihe algorithms used to control heaters 32 and 34 are used<br>
in connection with control of the nterface circuits actually connected with heaters 32 and<br>
34 irrespective of the interconnection error Consequently, the control algorithm controlling<br>
application of electrical energy to heater 32 is evaluated as appropriate for heater 32 and<br>
the control algorithm associated with application of electrical energy to heater 34 is<br>
likewise evaluated as appropriate for heater 34, notwithstanding that the control interface<br>
circuit intended to be connected to heater 34 is actually connected to heater 32 and vice<br>
versa. At the same time, the expected identification signals for connectors 70 and 78<br>
would be re-programmed to eliminate the discrepancy between the actual interconnection<br>
and the intended interconnection. Whereby, decoder 62 would no longer indicate<br>
undesired interconnection so that execution of the diagnostic routines would not result in<br>
initiation of any error responses.<br>
It is contemplated that functional equivalents of the procedures illustrated and<br>
described with reference to the flow charts of Figs. 3, 4a and 4b can be readily substituted<br>
to achieve the same results. It is not intended that the invention be limited to the specifics<br>
of those procedures, but that the invention be defined by the scope of the appended<br>
