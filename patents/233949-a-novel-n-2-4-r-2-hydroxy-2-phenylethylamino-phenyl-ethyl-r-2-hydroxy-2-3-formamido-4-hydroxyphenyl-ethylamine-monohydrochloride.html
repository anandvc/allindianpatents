				<td>Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to Crystalline N-{2- [4- ((R)-2-hydroxy-2-phenylethylamino) phenyl] ethyl}- (R)-2-hydroxy-2- (3-formamido-4-hydroxyphenyl) ethylamine monohydrochloride.<br>
The invention is directed to a ß2 adrenergic receptor agonist in crystalline salt form. The invention is also directed to pharmaceutical compositions comprising the crystalline agent, formulations containing the pharmaceutical compositions, methods of using the crystalline agent to treat diseases associated with ß2 adrenergic receptor activity, and processes useful for preparing such a crystalline compound.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
P2 Adrenergic receptor agonists are recognized as effective drugs for the treatment of pulmonary diseases such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (including chronic bronchitis and emphysema). ß2 Adrenergic receptor agonists are also useful for treating pre-term labor, and are potentially useful for treating neurological disorders and cardiac disorders. Commonly assigned U.S. Patent No. 6,576,793 Bl discloses the novel compound N-{2-[4-((R)-2-hydroxy-2-<br>
phenylethylammo)phenyl]ethyl}-(R)-2-hydroxy-2-(3-formamido-4-hydroxyphenyl)ethylamine,<br><br>
(Formula Removed)<br><br>
as a potent ß2 adrenergic receptor agonist. Compound 1 is alternatively referenced by the chemical names N-[3-[(lR)-l-hydroxy-2-[[2-[4-[(2R)-2-hydroxy-2-phenylethyl)amino]phenyl]ethyl]amino]ethyl-6-hydroxyphenyl]-formamide, (α-R)-3-formarnido-4-hydroxy-α-[[[ß-(N-((2R)-hydroxy-phenethyl))-amino-phenethyl]amino]methyl benzyl alcohol, and N-[2-hydroxy-5-[(lR)-l-hydroxy-2-[[2-[4-[[(2R)-2-hydroxy-2-phenylethyl]amino]phenyl]ethyl]amino]ethyl]phenyl]-formamide.<br>
Active agents for the treatment of pulmonary diseases are advantageously administered by inhalation. Preparation of formulations for administration by inhalation typically relies on the existence of a crystalline form of the active agent, or of a crystalline form of a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of the active agent, having suitable physical and chemical properties. For example, crystalline salts used in formulations administered by inhalation typically must be non-hygroscopic and thermally stable. Thus it would be desirable to provide a crystalline form of compound 1 or of a salt thereof that is stable upon storage even under conditions of elevated temperature and relative humidity.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
The present invention provides crystalline N-{2-[4-((R)-2-hydroxy-2-phenylethylamino)phenyl]ethyl}-(R)-2-hydroxy-2-(3-formamido-4-hydroxyphenyl)ethylamine monohydrochloride. A crystalline monohydrochloride salt of compound 1 has been characterized by x-ray powder diffraction (XRPD), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), infrared spectroscopy (IR), nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR), and by elemental analysis.<br>
The monohydrochloride salt of compound I has been found to be neither hygroscopic nor deliquescent, even when exposed to the atmosphere for prolonged periods at high relative humidity; and to be thermally stable at elevated temperatures.<br>
The invention also provides pharmaceutical compositions comprising the monohydrochloride salt of compound 1 and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The pharmaceutical compositions include formulations that are specifically prepared for administration by inhalation. Further, the invention provides combinations comprising the monohydrochloride salt of compound 1 and one or more other therapeutic agents and pharmaceutical compositions comprising such combinations.<br>
In another aspect, the invention provides a method of treating a disease or condition associated with pa adrenergic receptor activity (e.g. a pulmonary disease, such as asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pre-term labor, a neurological disorder, a cardiac disorder, or inflammation) in a mammal, the method comprising administering to the mammal, a therapeutically effective amount of the monohydrochloride salt of compound 1. The invention also provides a method of treatment comprising administering a combination of a therapeutically effective amount of the monohydrochloride salt of compound .1 together with one or more other therapeutic agents.<br>
The invention further provides the monohydrochloride salt of compound 1 for use in medical therapy, as well as the use of the monohydrochloride salt of compound .1 or of a pharmaceutical composition comprising the monohydrochloride salt of compound 1 in the manufacture of a medicament for treating a disease or condition associated with p2 adrenergic receptor activity in a mammal.<br>
In yet another aspect, the invention provides a process for preparing the crystalline monohydrochloride salt of compound 1, comprising the steps of dissolving N-{2-[4-((R)-2-hydroxy-2-phenylethylamino)phenyl]ethyl}-(R)-2-hydroxy-2-(3-formamido-4-hydroxyphenyl)ethylamine in a polar solvent to form a first solution; and adding aqueous hydrochloric acid containing between about 0.9 and about 1 mole of chloride ions per mole of compound 1 to form a second solution, from which the monoHCl salt is formed by crystallization. Alternative methods of forming the present monoHCl salt are also provided as additional aspects of the invention.<br>

Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
When describing the compounds, compositions and methods of the invention, the following terms have the following meanings, unless otherwise indicated.<br>
The term "therapeutically effective amount" refers to an amount sufficient to effect treatment when administered to a patient in need of treatment.<br>
The term "treatment" as used herein refers to the treatment of a disease or medical condition in a patient, such as a mammal (particularly a human) which includes:<br>
(a)	preventing the disease or medical condition from occurring, i.e.,<br>
prophylactic treatment of a patient;<br>
(b)	ameliorating the disease or medical condition, i.e., eliminating or causing<br>
regression of the disease or medical condition in a patient;<br>
(c)	suppressing the disease or medical condition, i.e., slowing or arresting the<br>
development of the disease or medical condition in a patient; or<br>
(d)	alleviating the symptoms of the disease or medical condition in a patient.<br>
The phrase "disease or condition associated with P1 adrenergic receptor activity"<br>
includes all disease states and/or conditions that are acknowledged now, or that are found in the future, to be associated with ß2 adrenergic receptor activity. Such disease states include, but are not limited to, bronchoconstrictive or pulmonary diseases, such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (including chronic bronchitis and emphysema), as well as neurological disorders and cardiac disorders.   ß2 Adrenergic receptor activity is also known to be associated with pre-term labor (see U.S. Patent No. 5,872,126) and some types of inflammation (see WO 99/30703 and U.S. Patent No. 5,290,815).<br>
It must be noted that, as used in the specification and appended claims, the singular forms "a", "an", "one", and "the" may include plural references, unless the content clearly dictates otherwise.<br>
The present invention provides crystalline -{2-[4-((R)-2-hydroxy-2-phenylethylamino)phenyl]ethyl}-(^?j-2-hydroxy-2-(3-formamido-4-hydroxyphenyl)ethylamine monohydrochloride. In one embodiment, a crystalline form of the present invention is characterized by an x-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) pattern having two or more diffraction peaks at 20 values selected from the group consisting of 6.00±0.2,7.99±0.2, 9.98±0.2,15.98±0.2,24.05±0.2,24.53±0.2,25.35±0.2,26.08±0.2,<br>
26.77±0.2, 28.13±0.2, 34.31±0.2, and 38.49±0.2. In particular, in this embodiment, the<br>
crystalline form is characterized by an x-ray powder diffraction pattern having two or more diffraction peaks at 20 values selected from the group consisting of 15.98±0.2, 24.05±0.2, 26.08±0.2, and 28.13±0.2.<br>
AJS is well known in the field of x-ray powder diffraction, relative peak heights of XRPD spectra are dependent on a number of factors having to do with sample preparation and instrument geometry, while peak positions are relatively insensitive to experimental details. Thus, in one embodiment, a crystalline monoHCl salt of compound 1_ is characterized by an x-ray powder diffraction pattern in which the peak positions are substantially in accordance with those shown in FIG. 1.<br>
In another embodiment, a crystalline form of the active salt is characterized by its infrared absorption spectrum which shows significant absorption bands at about 699, 788, 810, 827, 875, 970,1026,1056,1080,1101, 1213, 1296, 1374,1441,1546, 1596,1660, 3371, and 3553 cm"1. Variability in infrared absorption peak positions is typically within an uncertainty of ±2 cm"1, preferably within an uncertainty of ±1 cm"1.<br>
In yet another embodiment, a crystalline monoHCl salt of the present invention is characterized by its differential scanning calorimetry trace which shows a minor endothermic feature between about 95 and 115 °C and an onset of significant endothermic heat How at about 200 °C, as illustrated in FIG. 2. The location of the higher temperature peak varied by more than 15 °C as the heating rate was varied between 2 °C/min and 10 °C/min, while the location of the lower temperature feature was found to be relatively insensitive to heating rate over the same range. DSC traces were also recorded under conditions in which a sample was heated at a rate of 5 °C/min to about 150 °C, cooled to room temperature at a rate of 5 °C/min, 30 °C/min, or 40-45 °C/min, and then heated again at a rate of 5 °C/min. For all cooling rates, an exothermic peak was observed as the temperature was lowered, and the location of the lower temperature peak on heating a second time was unchanged from the first heating.<br>
Without being bound to any theory of action, the sensitivity of the DSC trace to heating rate together with comparison of the DSC trace with thermogravimetric analysis data supports the inference that the crystal form of this embodiment exhibits simultaneous melting and decomposition as the temperature is scanned above the onset temperature of about 200 °C. The experimental observations further support the conclusion that the lower temperature feature is characteristic of the embodiment illustrated in FIG. 2.<br>
A crystalline monoHCl salt of the present invention has been demonstrated to be stable upon exposure to elevated temperature and humidity. For example, after storage for four weeks at 40 °C and 75 % humidity in both open and closed containers and at 50 °C in a closed container, analysis by DSC shows no detectable difference and analysis by high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) shows no appreciable chemical degradation.<br>
The active agent, N-{2-[4-((R)-2-hydroxy-2-phenylethylamino)phenyl]ethyl}-(R)-2-hydroxy-2-(3-formamido-4-hydroxyphenyl)ethylamine, compound 1, can be synthesized from readily available starting materials as shown in the following Scheme and further described in the Examples below. It will be appreciated that while specific process conditions (i.e. reaction temperatures, times, mole ratios of reactants, solvents, pressures, etc.) are given, other process conditions can also be used unless otherwise stated.<br>
 (Figure Removed)<br>
Intermediate 2 can be prepared by the coupling of 2-(4-aminophenyl)ethylamine and (fl)-styrene oxide. The amine, which is optionally provided as a salt, is first reacted with between about 1 and about 1.2 equivalents of a base having a pKa value greater than about 18, in order to substantially deprotonate the 4-amino group. The (R)-styrene oxide is added to the product of the amine reaction. Useful basic compounds include sodium bis(trimethylsilyl)amide., alternatively known as sodium hexamethyldisilazane (NaHMDS), lithium diisopropyl amide, and n-butyl lithium. The reaction is preferably conducted in a solvent system including a polar aprotic solvent, such as 1,3-dimethyl-<br>
3,4,5,6-tetrahydro-2(lH)pyrimidinone (DMPU). Additional examples of aprotic polar solvents include dimethylsulfoxide, N-methyl pyrollidinone, N,N-dimethyl acetamide, tetramethylethylenediamine, and hexamethylphosphoramide.<br>
In the process according to the present invention, no protecting groups are required on the reactants. In addition, under the present conditions, the desired regioisomer is formed in significant quantities. When a strong base capable of deprotomating the aniline is not included, the reaction gives, primarily, the undesired regioisomer resulting from endo opening of the epoxide. Inclusion of the polar aprotic solvent in the solvent system allows the anion formed from deprotonation of the aniline to remain in solution.<br>
After aqueous extraction, the product of the coupling reaction is crystallized as the hydrochloride salt from a solvent such as isopropanol, by the addition of aqueous hydrochloric acid. The crystallization procedure efficiently separates the desired product from side products formed during the reaction. The hydrochloride salt is redissolved with 10 N aqueous sodium hydroxide to provide 2-[4-((R)-2-hydroxy-2-phenylethylamino)phenyl]ethylamine (2)<br>
The corresponding (S) stereoisomer, 2-[4-((S)-2-hydroxy-2-<br>
phenylethylamino)phenyl]ethylamine, can be prepared by substituting (5)-styrene oxide for (/?)-styrene oxide in the above procedure for the synthesis of intermediate 2.<br>
(J?)-2-Bromo-l-(3-formamido-4-benzyloxyphenyl)ethanol (3), can be prepared as described in U.S. Patent No. 6,268,533 Bl; and in R. Hett et al., Organic Process Research and Development, 1998, 2, 96-99. Intermediate 3 can also be prepared using procedures similar to those described by Hong et al., Tetrahedron Lett., 1994, 55, 6631; or similar to those described in U.S. Patent No. 5,495,054. Intermediate 4, 2-bromo-(R)-1 -tert-butyldimethylsiloxy-l -(3-formamido-4-benzyloxyphenyl)ethane, including the protecting group tert~butydimethylsilyl (TBS) at the hydroxyl position of 3, can be formed by the addition of tert-butydimethylsilylchloride (TBDMSC1) and imidazole to intermediate 3, dissolved in dimethylformamide (DMF).<br>
Intermediates 2 and 4 are coupled, using dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) as the solvent, by adding potassium carbonate and sodium iodide and heating to about 140°C to form intermediate 5, N-{2-[4-((R)-2-hydroxy-2-phenylethylamino)phenyl]ethyl}-(R)-2-tert-butyldimemylsiloxy-2-(3-formamido-4-benzyloxyphenyl)ethylamine. The TBS protecting group is removed from 5, dissolved in tetrahydrofuran (THF), by addition of<br>
triethylamine trihydrofluoride (TREAT HF), giving intermediate 6, IV-{2-[4-((R)-2-hydroxy-2-phenylethylamino)phenyI]ethyl}-(R)-2-hydroxy-2-(3-formamido-4-benzyloxyphenyl)ethylamine, upon isolation. The benzyl protecting group is removed from intermediate 6 by catalytic hydrogenolysis, using palladium on activated carbon, providing the active compound 1.<br>
A crystalline monohydrochloride salt of the present invention can be formed by the addition of between about 0.9 and about 1 molar equivalent of aqueous hydrochloric acid to the active compound 1 dissolved in a polar solvent. Suitable polar solvents include isopropanol and water. To induce crystallization, preferably the solution from which the monoHCl product is crystallized includes isopropanol and water in a ratio of isopropanol to water of from about 4:1 to about 10:1, volume to volume. More preferably, the ratio of isopropanol to water is from about 4:1 to about 7:1, volume to volume. The water component can be present in the polar solvent or can be introduced as aqueous hydrochloric acid. Preferably the ratio of total solvent to free base material is from about 15:1 to about 50:1, volume (mL) to weight (g). Optionally, the mixture of compound jl and polar solvent can be heated to dissolve the freebase and the resulting mixture cooled back to room temperature before addition of hydrochloric acid.<br>
For example, a crystalline monoHCl salt can be formed by dissolving compound ^ in isopropanol at a temperature of between about 40 °C and about 60 °C, cooling to room temperature, adding aqueous hydrochloric acid, and stirring during crystallization. The crystalline product can be isolated by filtration and dried under vacuum.<br>
Alternatively, a crystalline monohydrochloride salt can be formed from the free base by the addition of a molar excess of an aqueous solution of an inorganic chloride at a pH of between about 5 and about 6 to the active compound 1 dissolved in a polar, water soluble solvent. A suitable source of chloride ions at relatively high pH is ammonium chloride and a suitable polar solvent is isopropanol. For example the crytalline monoHCl salt can be formed by dissolving compound 1. in isopropanol, adding aqueous ammonium chloride, and allowing the solution to stand overnight at room temperature. The crystalline product can be isolated by filtration and dried.<br>
Using another alternative process, a crystalline monoHCl salt can be formed from the protected intermediate 5. As described in Example 13 below, according to this alternative process, intermediate 5 is first contacted with a weak acid, for example, acetic acid, to effect selective protonation and then contacted with a source of chloride ions, for<br>
example, sodium chloride, to effect anion exchange. The protecting groups are removed sequentially. The TBS protecting group is removed, for example using cesium fluoride in an organic solvent, providing the monoHCl salt of intermediate 6, and then the benzyl protecting group is removed, for example, by hydrogenation using a palladium or platinum catalyst. A monohydrochloride salt of compound 1 may be obtained in crystalline form by precipitation from an aqueous organic solution.<br>
m yet another alternative method, a crystalline monochloride salt of the present invention can be formed from a water slurry of the corresponding dihydrochloride salt. To form the slurry, water is added to a vial of the diHCl salt of compound 1 and the resulting product is stirred for more than 48 hours. Optionally, the pH of the slurry can be adjusted to between about 5 and about 6 before stirring.   The crystalline monoHCl product ean be isolated from the slurry by filtration and dried.<br>
Further, it has been discovered that a crystalline monohydrochloride salt of the present invention, can be obtained by recrystallizing a hydrochloride salt of compound 1 having between 1 and 2 equivalents of chlorine per mole of compound 1. The monohydrochloride salt can be formed by dissolving a hydrochloride salt of compound 1_ having between 1 and 2 equivalents of chlorine per mole of free base in a polar solvent to form a fifst solution and adding a polar solvent to form a second solution from which the salt form crystallizes. As described in Examples 9 and 10 below, the monohydrochloride salt was produced by dissolving a hydrochloride salt having 1.52 equivalents of HC1 per mole of free base in isopropanol and water at elevated temperature, diluting with isopropanol,, and cooling to room temperature with stirring.<br>
A procedure for the formation of the dihydrochloride salt of the present active agent is as follows. At least two equivalents of hydrochloric acid is added to compound 1 dissolved in a polar solvent. To induce crystallization, preferably the solution from which the diHCl product is crystallized includes isopropanol and water in a ratio of isopropanol to water of from about 4:1 to about 10:1, volume to volume. More preferably, the ratio of isopropanol to water is from about 4:1 to about 7:1, volume to volume. The water component can be present in the polar solvent or can be introduced as aqueous hydrochloric acid. Preferably the ratio of total solvent to free base material is from about 15:1 to about 50:1, volume (mL) to weight (g). Optionally, the mixture of compound \_ and polar solvent can be heated to dissolve the freebase and the resulting mixture cooled<br>
back to room temperature before addition of hydrochloric acid.<br>
For example, the crystalline diHCl salt can be formed by dissolving compound 1 in isopropanol at a temperature of between about 40 °C and about 60 °C, cooling to room temperature, adding aqueous hydrochloric acid, and stirring during crystallization. The crystalline product can be isolated by filtration and dried under vacuum.<br>
Optionally, the crystalline diHCl salt can be recrystallized by redissolving the crystalline salt in a polar solvent as described above. To ensure that the recrystallized product has two equivalents of HC1 per mole of free base, particularly when preparing the product at greater than gram scale, hydrochloric acid can be included in the polar solvent. In these preparations, between about 0.5 and about 1.5, for, example, about 1 equivalent of HC1 per mole of free base is usefully included in the polar solvent.<br>
As illustrated in Example 6b below, the crystalline diHCl salt can be recrystallized by dissolving in a mixture of isopropanol and water at elevated temperature, diluting with isopropanol, and cooling to room temperature with stirring. The diHCl product can be isolated by filtration and dried under vacuum.<br>
Pharmaceutical Compositions<br>
A crystalline form of the monoHCl salt of the present invention is advantageously used to prepare pharmaceutical compositions formulated for administration by inhalation. Inhalation is an effective means for delivering an agent directly to the respiratory tract. There are three general types of pharmaceutical inhalation devices: nebulizer inhalers, dry powder inhalers (DPI), and metered-dose inhalers (MDI). Conventional nebulizer devices produce a stream of high velocity air that causes a therapeutic agent to spray as a mist which is carried into the patient's respiratory tract. The therapeutic agent is formulated in a liquid form such as a solution or a suspension of micronized particles of respirable size, where micronized is typically defined as having about 90 % or more of the particles with a diameter of less than about 10 µm. Suitable nebulizer devices are provided commercially, for example, by PARI GmbH (Starnberg, Germany). Other nebulizer devices have been disclosed, for example, in U.S. Patent 6,123,068. The present crystalline monoHCl salt can be formulated for use in a conventional nebulizer device as an aqueous solution at a concentration of between about 0.05 µg/mL and about 10 mg/mL of the free base active agent, compound J..<br>
DPl's typically administer a therapeutic agent in the form of a free flowing powder<br>
that can be dispersed in a patient's air-stream during inspiration. Alternative DPI devices<br>
which use an external energy source are also being developed. In order to achieve a free flowing powder, the therapeutic agent can be formulated with a suitable excipient (e.g., lactose), A dry powder formulation can be made, for example, by combining dry lactose having a particle size between about 1 urn and 100 µm with micronized particles of the monoHCl salt of compound 1. and dry blending. Alternatively, the agent can be formulated without excipients. The formulation is loaded into a dry powder dispenser, or into inhalation cartridges or capsules for use with a dry powder delivery device.<br>
Examples of DPI delivery devices provided commercially include Diskhaler (GlaxoSmithKline, Research Triangle Park, NC) (see, e.g., U.S. Patent No. 5,035,237); Diskus (GlaxoSmithKline) (see, e.g., U.S. Patent No. 6,378,519; Turbuhaler (AstraZeneca, Wilmington, DE) (see, e.g., U.S. Patent No. 4,524,769); and Rotahaler (GlaxoSmithKline) (see, e.g., U.S. Patent No. 4,353,365). Further examples of suitable DPI devices are described in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,415,162, 5,239,993, and 5,715,810 and references therein.<br>
MDl's typically discharge a measured amount of therapeutic agent using compressed propellant gas. Formulations for MDI administration include a solution or suspension of active ingredient in a liquefied propellant. While chlorofluorocarbons, such as CCl3F, conventionally have been used as propellants, due to concerns regarding adverse affects of such agents on the ozone layer, formulations using hydrofluoroalklanes (HFA), such as 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane (HFA 134a) and 1,1,1,2,3,3,3-heptafluoro-n-propane, (HFA 227) have been developed. Additional components of HFA formulations for MDI administration include co-solvents, such as ethanol, pentane, or minor amounts of water; and surfactants, such as sorbitan trioleate, oleic acid, lecithin, and glycerin. (See, for example, U.S. Patent No. 5,225,183, EP 0717987 A2, and WO 92/22286).<br>
Thus, a suitable formulation for MDI administration can include from about 0.001 % to about 2 % by weight of the present crystalline form, from about 0 % to about 20 % by weight ethanol, and from about 0 % to about 5 % by weight surfactant, with the remainder being the HFA propellant. In one approach, to prepare the formulation, chilled or pressurized hydrofluoroalkane is added to a vial containing the present crystalline form, ethanol (if present) and the surfactant (if present). To prepare a suspension, the pharmaceutical salt is provided as micronized particles. The formulation is loaded into an aerosol canister, which forms a portion of an MDI device. Examples of MDI devices<br>
developed specifically for use with HFA propellants are provided in U.S. Patent Nos. 6,006,745 and 6,143,227.<br>
In an alternative preparation, a suspension formulation is prepared by spray drying a coating of surfactant on micronized particles of the present crystalline material. (See, for example, WO 99/53901 and WO 00/61108).   For additional examples of processes of preparing respirable particles, and formulations and devices suitable for inhalation dosing see U.S. Patent Nos. 6,268,533, 5,983,956, 5,874,063, and 6,221,398, and WO 99/55319 and WO 00/30614.<br>
The present active agent, compound 1, is useful as a ß2 adrenergic receptor agonist and therefore is useful for treating medical diseases or conditions mediated by ß2 adrenergic receptors or associated with pa adrenergic receptor activity in a mammal, i.e. medical conditions which are ameliorated by treatment with a ß2 adrenergic receptor agonist. Such medical conditions include but are not limited to a pulmonary disease, such as asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pre-term labor, a neurological disorder, a cardiac disorder, or inflammation.<br>
The present active agent, compound 1, is effective over a wide dosage range and is generally administered in a therapeutically effective amount. It will be understood, however, that the amount of the compound actually administered will be determined by a physician, in the light of the relevant circumstances, including the condition to be treated, the chosen route of administration, the actual compound administered and its relative activity, the age, weight, and response of the individual patient, the severity of the patient's symptoms, and the like.<br>
Suitable doses of the therapeutic agent for inhalation administration are in the general range of from about 0.05 µg/day to about 1000 µg/day, preferably from about 0.1 µg/day to about 500 µg/day.<br>
A compound can be administered in a periodic dose: weekly, multiple tunes per week, daily, or multiple doses per day. The treatment regimen may require administration over extended periods of time, for example, for several weeks or months, or the treatment regimen may require chronic administration. Suitable doses for oral administration are in the general range of from about 0.05 µg/day to about 100 mg/day, preferably from about 0.5 ]µg/day to about 1000 µg/day.<br>
The invention thus provides a method of treating a mammal having a disease or condition associated with pa adrenergic receptor activity, the method comprising administering to the mammal a therapeutically effective amount of the monohydrochloride salt of compound 1 or of a pharmaceutical composition comprising the monohydrochloride salt of compound .1<br>
