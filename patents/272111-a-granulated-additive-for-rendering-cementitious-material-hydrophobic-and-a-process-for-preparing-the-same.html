				<td>CEMENTITIOUS MATERIALS<br>
[0001] The present invention relates to cementitious materials, which exhibit a<br>
hydrophobic character. The invention also relates to a process for making cementitious<br>
materials hydrophobic, and to a granulated additive for rendering cementitious material<br>
hydrophobic.<br>
[0002] It has, for a long time, been desirable for cementitious materials, which have been<br>
applied to a substrate, such as an external wall, to be, to some extent hydrophobic. A<br>
number of solutions have been suggested in the past including the post-treatment of<br>
previously applied cementitious material and the addition of hydrophobing additives to<br>
cementitious materials prior to their application to a substrate. In the most common<br>
situations hydrophobing additives are added immediately prior to or during the process of<br>
applying the cementitious material to a substrate. It is, however, preferred to provide a<br>
cementitious material which has incorporated therein a hydrophobing agent or additive prior<br>
to application to a substrate, even more preferably at the stage where the cementitious<br>
material is in a dry, powdery form.<br>
[0003] EP 0811584 describes a granulated hydrophobing additive in cement. The<br>
granulated additive comprising an active organopolysiloxane component, a water-soluble or<br>
water dispersible binder and water-soluble, water-insoluble or water dispersible carrier<br>
particles. The additive is readily dispersible in cementitious materials upon the addition of<br>
water due to the non-hydrophobic nature of the granules. All of the carrier particles<br>
identified as suitable for this purpose were inactive and wettable in water, e.g. calcium<br>
carbonate. The use of this organopolysiloxane hydrophobing agent provides excellent<br>
hydrophobic properties to cementitious materials. However, the effectiveness of the<br>
hydrophobic properties were observed to increase with each wetting of the applied<br>
cementitious material, particularly when the binder and carrier were water soluble materials,<br>
and as such provided limited initial hydrophobic protection when compared with traditional<br>
hydrophobers used in the industry such as metal soaps. For many uses, instant<br>
hydrophobisation of the cementitious material is desirable.<br>
[0004] WO 02/30846 describes a granulated hydrophobing additive comprising from 50 to<br>
90 parts by weight of a salt or ester of palmitic, stearic or oleic acid salt, from 20 to 50 parts<br><br>
by weight of a water-soluble or water-dispersible binder and from 0 to 20 parts by weight of<br>
an organopolysiloxane.<br>
[0005] US 6268423 describes building compositions containing hydrophobing powders<br>
comprising silica as support material and an organosilicon compound and optionally solvent<br>
and/or water and emulsifier.<br>
[0006] WO 99/28264 describes a waterproofing additive for cement and/or concrete<br>
comprising a pozzolanic material such as silica fume, refined natural microsilica or<br>
metakaolin modified with a hydrophobic material such as butyl stearate, calcium stearate,<br>
oleic acid or a silicon emulsion.<br>
[0007] Although the prior art has provided useful ways of rendering cementitious or other<br>
materials hydrophobic there is always a desire for further improvements, especially in the<br>
instantaneous hydrophobicity imparted to cementitious materials when the hydrophobing<br>
agent is dispersed throughout a set cementitious material such as mortar or renders.<br>
[0008] In a process according to the invention for preparing a granulated hydrophobing<br>
additive for cementitious material comprising an organosilicon component and a binder<br>
polymer deposited on a particulate carrier, the organosilicon component and binder<br>
polymer are applied to the particulate carrier from aqueous emulsion.<br>
[0009] It has been observed that such a granulated hydrophobic additive is able to<br>
provide a high initial hydrophobicity to cementitious materials to which it is applied and that<br>
the obtained hydrohobicity can last during a long period of time.<br>
[0010] The invention includes a cementitious material in powder form, comprising dry<br>
cement and a granulated hydrophobing additive prepared by the above process, the<br>
granulated hydrophobing additive being present in an amount sufficient to give from 0.01 to<br>
2% by weight of the organosilicon component based on the weight of dry cement.<br>
[0011] A granulated additive is a product resulting from the agglomeration of small size<br>
particles, which for example can have a size between 20 and 1000 microns. A granule is<br>
typically formed of different components agglomerated or glued together in a single<br><br>
particle, as opposed to ordinary powder additive where solid powder components are<br>
physically mixed together so that each component remains as a separate, individual<br>
particle.<br>
[0012] A granulated additive according to the invention for rendering cementitious<br>
material hydrophobic comprises an organosilicon component and a binder polymer<br>
deposited on a particulate carrier, and is characterised in that an emulsifier for the<br>
organosilicon component is deposited on the particulate carrier together with the<br>
organosilicon component and the binder.<br>
[0013] The organosilicon component can be an organopolysiloxane. This may be chosen<br>
from any known organopolysiloxane materials, i.e. materials which are based on a Si-O-Si<br>
polymer chain and which may comprise mono-functional, di-funotional, tri-functional and/or<br>
tetra-functional siloxane units, many of which are commercially available. It is preferred<br>
that the majority of siloxane units are di-functional materials having the general formula<br>
RR'SiO2/2. wherein R or R' independently denotes an organic component or an amine,<br>
hydroxyl, hydrogen or halogen substituent. Preferably R will be selected from hydroxyl<br>
groups, alkyl groups, alkenyl groups, aryl groups, alkyl-aryl groups, aryl-alkyl groups, alkoxy<br>
groups, aryloxy groups and hydrogen. More preferably a substantial part, most preferably<br>
a majority of the R substituents will be alkyl groups having from 1 to 12 carbon atoms, most<br>
preferably methyl or ethyl groups. The organopolysiloxane can for example be<br>
polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS). Alternatively the organopolysiloxane may comprise<br>
methylalkylsiloxane units in which the said alkyl group contains 2-20 carbon atoms. Such<br>
methylalkylsiloxane polymers, particularly those in which the said alkyl group contains 6-20<br>
carbon atoms, may confer even higher water resistance than PDMS. One example of such<br>
a polymer is a dimethyl methyloctyl siloxane copolymer sold by Dow Corning under the<br>
product name 16-846. Blends of organopolysiloxanes can be used, for example a blend of<br>
a methylalkylsiloxane polymer with a linear PDMS.<br>
[0014] Some of the R groups of the organopolysiloxane can be alkyl groups bearing a<br>
trialkoxysilyl moiety to provide appropriate reactivity of the resultant organosiloxane<br>
component towards cementitious materials. The trialkoxysilyl moieties have the general<br>
formula (RO)3SiO1/2, where R can be a alkyl group having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms.<br>
Trialkoxygroups can for example be introduced by a hydrosilylation reaction between an<br><br>
organopolysiloxane containing one or more Si-H groups and an allyl trialkoxysilane. An<br>
example of such a polyorganosiloxane is the dimethyl methyloctyl<br>
methyl(triethoxysilyl)propyl siloxane copolymer sold by Dow Corning under the product<br>
name 16-606.<br>
[0015] Although it is preferred that the majority of siloxane units are di-functional siloxane<br>
units other units such as tri-functional or tetra-functional units may also be present resulting<br>
in the polymer chain exhibiting a certain amount of branching. For example resinous<br>
organopolysiloxane materials may be used such as a condensation product of a partially<br>
hydrolysed trialkoxysilane such as n-octyl trimethoxysilane or n-octyl triethoxysilane.<br>
Blends of such resinous organopolysiloxane materials with a linear polyorganosiloxane<br>
such as PDMS can be used.<br>
[0016] The total number of siloxane units is preferably such that the organopolysiloxane<br>
material has a viscosity of from 1 to a maximum of about 60,000 mm2/s at 25°C. More<br>
preferably the viscosity of the siloxane should not exceed about 5,000 mm2/s at 25°C.<br>
[0017] The organosilicon component can alternatively be a dialkoxysilane or<br>
trialkoxysilane, or a mixture of these with each other or with an organopolysiloxane. The<br>
dialkoxysilane generally has the formula Z2Si(OZ')2 and the trialkoxysilane generally has<br>
the formula ZSi(OZ')3 in which Z in each formula represents an alkyl, substituted alkyl, aryl<br>
or substituted aryl group having 1 to 20 carbon atoms and each Z' represents an alkyl<br>
group having 1 to 6 carbon atoms. The group Z can for example be substituted by a<br>
halogen, particularly fluoro, group, an amino group or an epoxy group, or an alkyl group<br>
can be substituted by a phenyl group or a phenyl group can be substituted by an alkyl<br>
group. Preferred silanes include those in which Z represents an alkyl group having 6 to 18<br>
carbon atoms and each Z' represents an alkyl group having 1 to 4, particularly 1 or 2,<br>
carbon atoms, for example n-octyl trimethoxysilane, 2-ethylhexyl triethoxysilane or n-octyl<br>
triethoxysilane.<br>
[0018] We have found that blends of such preferred silanes with an organopolysiloxane<br>
can form highly advantageous hydrophobing additives when granulated via an emulsion<br>
according to the present invention. Organopolysiloxanes such as linear<br>
polydimethylsiloxane or the dimethyl methyloctyl methyl(triethoxysilyl)propyl siloxane<br><br>
copolymer 'Dow Corning 16-606' are excellent in conferring instantaneous hydrophobic<br>
properties. A long chain alkyl trialkoxysilane such as n-octyl triethoxysilane is not always as<br>
good in conferring instantaneous hydrophobic properties, but is even better than the<br>
organopolysiloxanes for maintaining the hydrophobic properties of the treated cementitious<br>
material over time. A blend of the organopolysiloxane and the trialkoxysilane confers<br>
excellent hydrophobic properties both instantaneously and over time.<br>
[0019] The binder polymer is a film forming material which aids in binding the<br>
organosilicon component to the particulate carrier. The binder polymer can be either water-<br>
soluble or water-insoluble, that is it can be either dissolved or emulsified in water in the<br>
aqueous emulsion of the organosilicon component that is applied to the carrier. Such<br>
binder materials (either water soluble or water insoluble) are preferably materials which at<br>
room temperature, i.e. from 20 to 25°C, have a solid consistency. Examples of suitable<br>
water-soluble or water-dispersible binder materials include polyvinyl alcohols, methyl<br>
cellulose, carboxy methyl cellulose, polycarboxylates and other film forming polymers.<br>
Examples of suitable water-insoluble but water-dispersible (emulsifiable) binder materials<br>
include polymers such as polyvinyl acetate, vinyl acetate ethylene copolymers and acrylate<br>
ester polymers. Blends of binder material as described above can be used, for example a<br>
blend of a water-soluble binder polymer such as polyvinyl alcohol with a water-insoluble<br>
binder polymer such as polyvinyl acetate. Water dispersion of the resultant granules may<br>
be facilitated by the appropriate blend of water soluble and water insoluble binder material.<br>
Most preferably the water solubility of the binder material should be such that it does not<br>
interfere with the hydration process of the cementitious material when water is added to the<br>
cementitious material prior to its application or use.<br>
[0020] The organosilicon component and binder polymer are applied to the particulate<br>
carrier from aqueous emulsion. The emulsifier present can for example be a nonionic,<br>
anionic, cationic or amphoteric emulsifier. Examples of non-ionic emulsifiers include<br>
polyvinyl alcohol, ethylene oxide propylene oxide block copolymers, alkyl or alkaryl<br>
polyethoxylates in which the alkyl group has 8 to 18 carbon atoms, alkyl polyglycosides or<br>
long chain fatty acids or alcohols. Some water-soluble polymers such as polyvinyl alcohol<br>
can thus act as both binder polymer and emulsifier. In some preferred emulsions polyvinyl<br>
alcohol acts as emulsifier and also as part of the binder polymer together with a water-<br>
insoluble polymer such as polyvinyl acetate. Examples of anionic surfactants include alkali<br><br>
metal and ammonium salts of fatty acids having 12 to 18 carbon atoms, alkaryl sulphonates<br>
or sulphates and long chain alkyl sulphonates or sulphates. Examples of cationic<br>
surfactants include quaternary ammonium salts containing at least one long chain alkyl<br>
group having 8 to 20 carbon atoms.<br>
[0021] The carrier particles may be water-insoluble, water-soluble or water-dispersible.<br>
Suitable examples of carrier particles include aluminosilicates (such as zeolite or<br>
metakaolin), fly ash, clay materials, lime, calcium carbonates, starch, native starch, methyl<br>
cellulose, carboxy methyl cellulose, cement, sand polystyrene beads and polyacrylate<br>
beads. It is preferred that the carrier particles have a mean diameter of from 0.1 to 5000<br>
µm, more preferably 0.2 to 1000µm, most preferably 0.2 to 50 µm. It is preferred to use<br>
materials which fulfil a useful role in cementitious compositions per se, for example<br>
aluminosilicates or cement itself.<br>
[0022] The granulated hydrophobing additive preferably comprises 50 to 85% by weight<br>
particulate carrier, from 1 to 10% by weight binder polymer and from 5 to 35% organosilicon<br>
component.<br>
[0023] Although it is preferred that the granulated hydrophobing additives consist only of<br>
the carrier particles, binder(s) and organosilicon component, additional ingredients may be<br>
included, for example viscosity modifiers, pigments, colorants, preservatives, gelling<br>
agents, pH modifiers, buffers, accelerators, retarders, air entrainers or fillers, e.g. silica and<br>
titanium dioxide. It is however preferred that such additional optional ingredients do not<br>
comprise more than 5% by weight of the total weight of the additive.<br>
[0024] The carrier particles are agglomerated with the organosilicon-binder emulsion<br>
potentially in the presence of a co-binder. The main advantage of using an agglomeration<br>
process to get an organosilicon-based powder is to get particles which are relatively porous<br>
as compared with a spray drying process. The porosity of the powder combined with the<br>
use of a water soluble binder enables the powder to be easily redispersible in the<br>
application.<br>
[0025] It is essential that the hydrophobing additive is granulated, which means that it has<br>
been prepared by a granulation process. Granulation methods have been described in a<br><br>
number of patent specifications including EP 0811584 and EP 496510. In the granulation<br>
process, the organosilicon component must be emulsified or at least dispersed in the<br>
aqueous solution or emulsion of the water-soluble or water-insoluble binder. The resultant<br>
emulsion is deposited in a liquid form, for example by spraying, onto the carrier particles<br>
e.g. in a fluid bed, thus causing the organosilicon component and binder in admixture to<br>
solidify, through the evaporation of water, onto the carrier particles and form a free flowing<br>
powder.<br>
[0026] In another granulation method the emulsion of organosilicon component and<br>
binder polymer is sprayed simultaneously into a drum mixer containing the carrier. The<br>
spray droplets partially evaporate on contact with the carrier particles. After mixing, the<br>
particles are transferred to a fluidised bed where evaporation is completed with ambient air.<br>
The granulated hydrophobing additive is then collected from the fluidised bed. Typical<br>
apparatus which is useful for granulation includes the Eirich® pan granulator, the Schugi®<br>
mixer, the Paxeson-Kelly® twin-core blender, the Lodige® ploughshare mixer, the Lodige<br>
® Continuous Ring Layer Mixer or one of the numerous types of fluidised bed apparatuses,<br>
e.g. Aeromatic® fluidised bed granulator. Optionally the particles may be further screened<br>
by sieving to produce particles of hydrophobing additive substantially free of any<br>
undersized or oversized material.<br>
[0027] The amount of granulated hydrophobing additive which is present in the<br>
cementitious material according to the invention is such that from 0.01 to 2% by weight of<br>
the organosilicon component is present based on the dry weight of cement. More<br>
preferably the amount of additive is preferably from 0.25 to 5% by weight of cement and<br>
the amount of organosilicon component is 0.05 to 1% by weight based on the weight of<br>
cement.<br>
[0028] The cementitious material according to the invention may also comprise additional<br>
ingredients. These additional ingredients may include sand, filler and other materials<br>
traditionally found in cementitious materials, e.g. lime, aggregate, accelerators, air<br>
entrainers, pigments, retarders and pozzolanic materials. The cementitious material can for<br>
example be cement, concrete, mortar or grout.<br><br>
[0029] A process according to the invention of imparting to cementitious material a<br>
hydrophobic character comprises mixing into the cementitious material a granulated<br>
hydrophobing additive as described above. Mixing may be done by mechanical means or<br>
any other appropriate method known in the art. Mixing can conveniently be carried out by<br>
dry mixing the granulated hydrophobing additive with the cementitious material at the stage<br>
where is in a dry, powdery form. Alternatively the hydrophobing additives can be added<br>
during or after hydration of the cement, for example immediately prior to or during the<br>
process of applying the cementitious material to a substrate.<br>
[0030] There now follows a number of examples which illustrate the invention. All parts<br>
and percentages are given by weight unless otherwise indicated.<br>
PREPARATION OF GRANULATED HYDROPHOBING ADDITIVE<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
[0031] 200 g of zeolite (DOUCIL 4A from INEOS), having a particle size of about 2 to 5<br>
µm was placed into a domestic kitchen food mixer. 56 grams organopolysiloxane (16-606<br>
from Dow Corning) was mixed in 56 g of an aqueous polyvinyl alcohol solution 5 % solid<br>
(Celvol 502 from Celanese, Hoppler viscosity : 3;5-4 mPas, 88% hydrolysis) for 3 minutes<br>
with a rotor/stator mixer (Ultraturrax). The resultant creamy emulsion was poured over the<br>
zeolite in the food mixer under agitation (at maximum mixer speed within a period of 15-30<br>
seconds resulting in a granulated powder). The granulated powder was dried in a fluidised<br>
bed for 15 minutes and sieved to remove any particles larger than 0.5 mm diameter.<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
[0032] An emulsion made of 16-606 organopolysiloxane (13.5 g), 6.7 g of 25% solution of<br>
easily re-dispersible polyvinylalcohol (Celvol SP 05/190 from Celanese, Hoppler viscosity: 5<br>
mPas, 84% hydrolysis), 3.4g of a dispersion of water-insoluble polyvinylacetate-ethylene<br>
(Vinamul 3265 from Celanese), 1.4 g of Renex 30 (from Uniquema) non-ionic surfactant<br>
and 3.4 g of water was prepared by mixing the different components with a rotor/stator<br>
mixer. The granulation step was carried out according to the procedure described in<br><br>
example 1 using 50 g of zeolite. The granulated powder was dried in a fluidised bed for 15<br>
minutes and sieved to remove any particles larger than 0.5 mm diameter.<br>
EXAMPLE 3<br>
[0033] Granules were prepared using the process described in Example 1 but using a<br>
silanol end-blocked polydimethylsiloxane of viscosity at 25°C about 100 mm2/s. as the<br>
polyorganosiloxane component and a different polyvinyl alcohol (Celvol SP 05/190 from<br>
Celanese, Hoppler viscosity: 5 mPas, 84% hydrolysis). An emulsion made of 14.6 g of the<br>
silanol ended polydimethylsiloxane, 7.3 g of a 25% solution of Celvol SP05/190 and 7.3 g<br>
of water was prepared by mixing the different components with a rotor/stator mixer. The<br>
resultant emulsion is poured onto 50 g of zeolite under agitation. The granulated powder<br>
was dried in a fluidised bed for 15 minutes and sieved to remove any particles larger than<br>
0.5 mm diameter.<br>
EXAMPLE 4<br>
[0034] An emulsion was made of 16-606 polyorganosiloxane(15.4g), 7.7 g of 25%<br>
solution of Celvol SP 05/190 PVAfrom Celanese, 3.8g of a 45% solids dispersion of water-<br>
insoluble polyvinylacetate, 1.6 g of Renex 30 (from Uniquema) non-ionic surfactant and 5.5<br>
g of water and prepared by mixing the different components with a rotor/stator mixer. The<br>
granulation step was carried out according to the procedure described in example 1 using<br>
100 g of precipitated Calcium carbonate (SOCAL from Solvay) as carrier. The granulated<br>
powder was dried in a fluidised bed for 15 minutes and sieved to remove any particles<br>
larger than 0.5 mm diameter.<br>
EXAMPLE 5<br>
[0035] 200 g of metakaolin (metastar 501 from ECC international) was placed into a<br>
domestic kitchen food mixer. 53.7 grams organopolysiloxane (16-846 from Dow Corning)<br>
was mixed in 53.7 g of a 45% dispersion of water-insoluble polyvinylacetate, 16.5g of<br>
polyvinyl alcohol solution 10 % solid (Mowiol 30-92 from Clariant) and 33 g of water were<br>
mixed for 3 minutes with a rotor/stator mixer (Ultraturrax). The resultant creamy emulsion<br>
was poured over the metakaolin in the food mixer under agitation. The granulated powder<br><br>
was dried in a fluidised bed for 15 minutes and sieved to remove any particles larger than<br>
0.5 mm diameter.<br>
EXAMPLE 6<br>
[0036] Granules were prepared by pouring an emulsion made of 12.5g of 16-606<br>
polyorganosiloxane, 6.3 g of 25% solution of Celvol SP 05/190 PVA from Celanese and 3.1<br>
g of water onto 50 g of zeolite. A 45% dispersion of water-insoluble polyvinylacetate (8.7 g)<br>
was also poured onto the zeolite at the same time as the polysiloxane emulsion. The<br>
modification of the process of preparation correspond to the co-addition of the polysiloxane<br>
emulsion and the dispersion of PVAC onto the zeolite under agitation. The granulated<br>
powder was dried in a fluidised bed for 15 minutes and sieved to remove any particles<br>
larger than 0.5 mm diameter.<br>
EXAMPLE 7<br>
[0037] Granules were prepared by pouring an emulsion made of 16-606<br>
polyorganosiloxane (95.8g), 96.1 g of a 45% water-insoluble polyvinylacetate dispersion,<br>
9.7 g of Renex 30 surfactant and 48.9 g of water onto 300 g of metakaolin (Metastar 501<br>
from ECC international) under agitation. The granulated powder was dried in a fluidised<br>
bed for 15 minutes and sieved to remove any particles larger than 0.5 mm diameter.<br>
EXAMPLE 8<br>
[0038] Granules were prepared by pouring an emulsion made of a silanol end-blocked<br>
polydimethylsiloxane of viscosity at 25°C about 100 mm2/s (73g), n-octyl triethoxysilane<br>
sold under the trade mark Dow Corning Z-6341 (73g) and 145 g of 20 % solution of Celvol<br>
502 from Celanese onto 500 g of zeolite under agitation. The granulated powder was<br>
dried in a fluidised bed for 2 minutes and sieved to remove any particles larger than 0.5 mm<br>
diameter.<br>
EXAMPLE 9<br><br>
[0039] 104 g of an emulsion made from 50 % of 2-6341 n-octyl triethoxysilane and 50 %<br>
of a 20% solution of Celvol 502 from Celanese was poured onto 138 g zeolite HA from<br>
Ineos under agitation. The granulated powder was dried in a fluidised bed and sieved to<br>
remove any particles larger than 0.5 mm diameter.<br>
EXAMPLE 10<br>
[0040] Granules were prepared by pouring an emulsion made of silanol end-blocked<br>
polydimethylsiloxane of viscosity at 25°C about 70 mm2/s (43.5g), n-octyl triethoxysilane<br>
sold under the trade mark Dow Coming Z-6341 (43.5g), 64 g of 20% solution of Celvol 502<br>
PVA from Celanese onto 200 g of zeolite HA from Ineos under agitation. The granulated<br>
powder was dried in a fluidised bed for 2 minutes at 60 °C and sieved to remove any<br>
particles larger than 0.5 mm diameter.<br>
PREPARATION OF THE CEMENTITIQUS MATERIALS<br>
[0041] A mixture of 54g of sand, 18g of cement and 1.63g granulated additive in<br>
accordance with present invention (which equates to approximately 0.5% by weight of<br>
active material) was introduced into a plastic cup and mixed with a laboratory mixer to<br>
homogenize the powder blend. 9g of water was introduced into the mixture and the mixing<br>
was continued for a further 2 minutes. The quantity of powdered additive added for each<br>
experiment was calculated according to the actual silicone content of the powder, such as<br>
to reach 0.5 % of active material in the dry mortar composition. The exact weight of<br>
powdered additive for each example is given in Table 1.<br>
[0042] The following tests were run on the above cementitious materials according to the<br>
invention, on a control sample containing no hydrophobing agent<br>
[0043] The dry cementitious powder mixture which had been prepared had sufficient<br>
water added thereto and the resulting aqueous mixture for each sample was then poured<br>
into a pre-prepared test piece mould measuring 100x100x25mm. The test piece was<br>
removed from the mould after 24 hours and allowed to cure in the lab for a further period of<br>
7 days at a temperature of between 16 to 24°C and at 100% relative humidity.<br><br>
[0044] After seven days, the test pieces were dried. Dry blocks were weighed (Wdry) and<br>
then immersed for a period of one hour in water, with the top surface of the block at a<br>
depth of 3cm below the water surface. After one hours the block was reweighed (Wwet).<br>
The blocks were then re-immersed for 2 additional hours (to reach an immersion time of 3<br>
hours), and reweighed. The same sequence is then re-applied to reach immersion time of<br>
24 hours. Results in Table 1 are obtained by use of the following equation wherein:<br><br>
[0045] In order to further exemplify the hydrophobic nature of the resulting cementitious<br>
products the contact angle of a 2 µl droplet of water placed on test pieces made according<br>
to each of Examples 1 to 8 containing 0.5% by weight of active organosiloxane material<br>
was measured and compared to a control test piece containing no hydrophobing additive.<br>
The samples 8 bis, 9 and 10 listed in the table 2 were tested at an addition level of only 0.5<br>
% of powder in the dry mortar formulation.<br>
[0046] Contact angle measurements were obtained using an optical bench installed in the<br>
device named "Traker" from the "Teclin" Firm A 2 µl droplet of Water was added at the<br>
surface a dry test specimen mounted on the optical bench and the contact angle was<br>
measured against time until either the drop was absorbed into the surface or had been lost<br>
by evaporation. In the case of the control test piece the contact angle was observed to<br>
reduce rapidly in a couple of seconds before being fully absorbed by the test piece,<br>
whereas the 2 µl droplet of water placed on the unwetted test pieces comprising granules<br>
from example 1 in accordance with the present invention resulted in a constant contact<br>
angle of 131° for over one minute until evaporation. It is to be understood that the higher<br>
the value of the contact angle the more water repellent the surface.<br><br><br>
[0047] It is to be noted that the water pick up on the cement samples containing the<br>
granules in accordance with the present invention give significantly improved initial<br>
hydrophobicity results compared to the control. The initial hydrophobicity results of the<br>
granules in accordance with the present invention are improved over granules as described<br>
in EP 0811584.<br><br>
EASE OF DISPERSION OF THE POWDER IN WATER<br>
[0048] Ease of dispersion of the powder in water was tested using the following<br>
procedure.<br>
•	Test 1: 50 g of water is poured into a transparent plastic container. 1 g of<br>
powder is gently deposited at the surface of water. Wetting of the powder<br>
and further dispersion into water is assessed visually<br>
•	Test 2: 50 g of water is poured into a transparent plastic container. 1 g of<br>
powder is gently deposited at the surface of water. The closed bottle is<br>
gently shaken for 10 seconds and the amount of powder wetted and or<br>
dispersed into water after 1 min is evaluated visually.<br>
•	Test 3: 50 g of water is poured into a transparent plastic container. 1 g of<br>
powder is gently deposited at the surface of water. The closed bottle is<br>
vigorously shaken and the amount of powder wetted and or dispersed into<br>
water after 1 min is evaluated visually.<br><br>
The powder A from Wacker is a powder made from Octyl-triethoxysilane mixed with silica<br>
Seal 80 from Elotex is a spray dried powder made of Octyl-triethoxysilane, PVA and<br>
Calcium Carbonate.<br><br>
