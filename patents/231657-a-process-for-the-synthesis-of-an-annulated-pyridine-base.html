				<td>A PROCESS FOR THE SYNTHESIS OF AN ANNULATED PYRIDINE BASE<br>
Field of invention<br>
The present invention relates to an improved process for the synthesis of an annulated pyridine base. More particularly, the present invention relates to a process for the synthesis of an annulated pyridine base over a molecular seive. The present invention particularly relates to a process for producing 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,-octahydroacridine by reacting cyclohexanone and formaldehyde with ammonia in gaseous phase over a molecular seive with high yields and selectivity.

Background of the invention<br>
Annulated pyridines such as 9-amino- 5,6,7,8 tetrahydroacridine (Tacrine) are drug intermediates for treatment of various diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, which is the most common cause of dementia in elderly people. Several methods of producing pyridine bases are known in the art such as reacting an aliphatic aldehyde and/or ketone with ammonia in gaseous phase using a solid acid catalyst such as amorphous aluminosilicate and the like, (Japanese patent application Kokai(Laid-Open) No. 63,176/76, Japanese Patent Publication Nos. 41,546/71, and 32,790/69).

Detailed description of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to a process for producing annulated pyridines by reacting cyclic ketones and an aliphatic aldehyde with ammonia in gaseous phase in the presence of a catalyst, wherein the catalyst was obtained by commercial or synthesized.<br>
The aliphatic cyclic ketones used in the present invention includes, cyclohexanone, cyclo pentanone, cycloheptanone and cyclooctanone and aliphtic aldehydes such as formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, propionaldehyde, butyraldehyde and formaldehyde. The combination of different cyclic ketones and aliphatic aldehydes as the starting materials determines the main compounds of the annulated pyridine to be produced. The typical examples are shown in the following Table 1.<br>
TABLE 1<br>
Aldehyde	ketone	Main products formed<br>
Formaldehyde	cyclo hexanone	Octahydro acridine<br>
Acetaldehyde	cyclo hexanone	9-Methyl octahydroacridine<br>
Propionaldehyde	cyclo hexanone	9-Ethyl octahydroacridine<br>
Formaldehyde	cyclo pentanone	Bis bi cyclopentyl pyridine<br>
Formaldehyde	cyclo heptanone	Bis bi cycloheptyl pyridine<br>
The reaction of the present invention may be conducted in a mode of fixed bed, fluidised bed or moving bed.<br>
The molar ratio of ammonia to the aliphatic cyclic ketone is 0.5 to 5 mol/mol. The weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) used is 0.25 to 1.00 Hr.sup.-l. The reaction temperature is preferably 350°C to 450°C. Although, the pressure of the reaction gases can be used in the range from below the atmospheric pressure to several atmospheric pressures, usually the pressure in the range used is atmospheric pressure.<br>
The particularly preferable combination of a cyclic ketone and aliphatic aldehyde and ammonia for production of octahydro acridine in the molar ratio of 1:1: 0.5-5.<br>
The reaction can be effected without any trouble if the gaseous starting materials may contain water, methanol or the like. However, when acetaldehyde and formaldehyde are used as the starting materials, the amount of methanol is preferably up to 0.5 mole per mole of the acetaldehyde. Formaldehyde can be fed in a form of formalin. Further, as the aliphatic aldehyde or ketone, a dimer, a trimer, the other oligomers or polymers capable of generating a monomer of aliphatic aldehyde or ketone in an evaporator or a reactor can also be used.<br>
Although deposition of carbon on the catalyst is detected during the reaction, the amount of the carbon deposited on the catalyst is smaller as the result of which higher yields of pyridine bases was obtained in composition with in conventional processes.<br>
Regeneration of the catalyst is easily effected by any conventional method such as burning out the carbon deposited on the catalyst by passing air through the catalyst layer at a temperature of 450°C to 550°C.<br>
By using the catalyst of the present invention, as shown, for example, in Example 1, the yield of octahydro acridine pyridine is 50.6% when the conversion of cyclic ketone was 69.7 wt%. The yields being shown as the value calculated based on the conversion of cyclic ketones. The present invention is described below in more detail referring to Examples, to which the present invention is not limited. <br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
According to J.S. Beck et al, Nature 359 (1992) 710, mesoporous molecular sieve MCM-41 was synthesized as follows.<br>
Solution A was prepared by mixing 0.38g of NaOH, 20ml of water, 0.76 g of Aluminium isoproxide and heated till a clear solution was obtained. After this 9.8 ml of Tetra ethyl ammonium hydroxide was added while cooling the mixture.<br>
Solution B was prepared by mixing 11.6 ml (9.6 g) of 50wt% ludox silica in 50 ml of distilled water the mixture was kept under vigorous stirring until a clear solution formed.<br>
Solution A was added to Solution B under vigorous stirring and kept for stirring for one hour, after that 10.55 g of Hexadecyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (HDTMABr). The pH was adjusted to 10.5.<br>
A stainless steel autoclave having 0.6 liters of volume was charged with the above solution.<br>
The autoclave was sealed and heated to 100°C. Hydrothermal synthesis was effected under this condition while continuing stirring for 20 hours. In this period, the inner pressure of the autoclave was 5 to 6 kg/cm2.<br>
After completion of the reaction, the reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature and the product was separated by filtration. After repetition of washing and filtration until the concentration of Br" ion in the filtrate became 1 ppm or below, the product was dried at 110°C for 16 hours and then calcined in air at 500°C. for 12 hours to elute the surfactant. White crystals of Na form Al-MCM-41 were obtained. As a result of the measurement of X-ray diffraction, the crystals had a diffraction pattern coincident with that of MCM-41 reported in Nature 1992 by Breck et al. After this the catalyst was pelletized and converted to 18-30 size mesh.<br>
 EXAMPLE 2<br>
A glass reaction tube having an inner diameter of 20 mm was filled with 4 g of this crystalline Al-MCM-41 catalyst. A mixture of 1 moles of cyclohexanone one mole of formaldehyde (40 wt% solution in water) fed on to the packed catalyst through preheating<br>
zone in gas form along with ammonia and the temperature maintained 400°C at the catalyst bed. The reaction products were collected at bottom through ice cold traps and analyzed by a FID gas chromatography. The products were further confirmed GC_MS and NMR.<br>
Average yields of the products in a period of 4 hours from the start of the reaction were found 50.6 % of octahydro acridine J.S. Beck et al, Nature 359 (1992) 710, 4.1% of cyclohexyl amine and other products. Another major product is the condensed product of two moles of cyclohexanone and one mole formaldehyde an intermediate in the formation of octahydro acridine.<br>

The reaction was carried out in same manner as in Example 2 except cyclo heptanone was used as cyclic ketone instead of cyclohexanone and the final product was bis cycloheptyl pyridine, 3 with selectivity of 44.9 at the conversion of cycloheptanone is 72.2 wt%.<br>
 EXAMPLE 8<br>
The reaction was carried out in same manner as in Example 2 except cyclooctanone was used instead of cyclohexanone and the final product was Bis cyclooctyl pyridine, 4 with selectivity 30.5 % at the conversion of 75.0 of cyclooctanone.<br>
EXAMPLE 9<br>
The  reaction  was  carried  out  in  same  manner  as  in  Example  2  except cyclopentanone and cyclohexanone were used as a mixture instead of cyclohexanone alone and the final product was Bis cyclopentyl hexyl pyridine, 5.<br>
 EXAMPLE 10<br>
The reaction was carried out in same manner as in Example 2 except acetaldehyde (35wt% ) was used as aliphatic aldehyde instead of formaldehyde and the final product was 9-Methyl octahydro acridine, 6 with 24.0 % and octahydro acridine,is 18.0 % selectivity at the 85.5% conversion of cyclohexanone.<br>
