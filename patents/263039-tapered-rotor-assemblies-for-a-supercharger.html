TAPERED ROTOR ASSEMBLIES FOR A SUPERCHARGER<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001]	The present invention relates to rotor assemblies having a generally<br>
tapering shape for use within a supercharger assembly.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002]	Roots-type and screw-type positive displacement compressors are<br>
employed in industrial and automotive applications. The compressor or supercharger<br>
may be operatively connected to an internal combustion engine to increase the amount<br>
or volume of intake air communicated to the internal combustion engine thereby<br>
increasing the volumetric efficiency thereof. The supercharger typically includes two<br>
interleaved and counter-rotating rotors each of which may be formed with a plurality of<br>
lobes to convey volumes of intake air from an inlet passage to an outlet passage for<br>
subsequent introduction to the internal combustion engine. The efficiency of the<br>
supercharger is dependent on the running clearances between each of the two rotors and<br>
a housing within which the two rotors are rotatably supported.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
f0003]	A rotor assembly is provided for a compressor assembly having a<br>
housing defining an inlet port, outlet port, and a rotor cavity in communication with the<br>
inlet port and outlet port. The rotor assembly includes a rotor body having a plurality<br>
of lobes formed thereon and rotatably mountable within the rotor cavity of the housing.<br>
The rotor body has a first end, substantially adjacent to the inlet port, and a second end,<br>
substantially adjacent to the outlet port, when mounted within the housing. Each of the<br>
plurality of lobes has an outer radius that is greater at the first end than at the second<br>
end.<br><br>
P000547-PTE-KFB<br>
2<br>
[0004]	The outer radius may generally taper from the first end to the second<br>
end. Alternatively, the outer radius may generally taper from a point between the first<br>
and second end to the second end. A compressor assembly incorporating the rotor<br>
assembly is also disclosed.<br>
[0005]	The above features and advantages and other features and advantages of<br>
the present invention are readily apparent from the following detailed description of the<br>
best modes for carrying out the invention when taken in connection with the<br>
accompanying drawings.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
[0006]	Figure lisa schematic perspective view of a supercharger assembly<br>
configured for use with an internal combustion engine;<br>
[0007]	Figure 2 is a schematic cross sectional view of the supercharger of Figure<br>
1 taken along line 2-2 of Figure 1;<br>
[0008]	Figure 3 is a schematic cross sectional view of the supercharger of Figure<br>
1 taken along line 3-3 of Figure 1; and<br>
[0009]	Figure 4 is a sectional drawing illustrating the generally tapering profile of<br>
rotors contained within the supercharger assembly of Figure 1.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
[0010]	Referring to the drawings wherein like reference numbers correspond to<br>
like or similar components throughout the several figures, there is shown in Figure 1 a<br>
compressor or supercharger assembly, generally indicated at 10. The supercharger 10<br>
includes a housing 12. The housing 12 defines an inlet passage 14 configured to induct<br>
intake air, represented by arrow 16, into the supercharger assembly 10. The housing 12<br>
further defines an outlet passage 18 configured to exhaust or expel the intake air 16 from<br>
the supercharger assembly 10.<br>
[0011]	A rotor cavity 20 is defined by the housing 12 and is configured to contain<br>
a first and second rotor assembly 22 and 24, respectively, rotatably disposed therein. The<br>
first and second rotor assemblies 22 and 24 are interleaved and counter-rotating. The<br><br>
P000547-PTE-KFB<br>
3<br>
first rotor assembly 22 includes a plurality of lobes 26 extending radially outward in a<br>
clockwise twisting helical shape, as viewed from the inlet passage 14, while the second<br>
rotor assembly 24 includes a plurality of lobes 28 extending radially outward in a<br>
counter-clockwise twisting helical shape, as viewed from the inlet passage 14. The first<br>
and second rotor assemblies 22 and 24 have first ends 30 and 32, respectively, disposed<br>
substantially adjacent to the inlet passage 14 and second ends 34 and 38, respectively,<br>
disposed substantially adjacent to the outlet passage 18. The first and second rotor<br>
assemblies 22 and 24 are rotatably supported within the rotor cavity 20 by a respective<br>
first and second shaft member 40 and 42. Those skilled in the art will recognize that<br>
the first and second rotor assemblies 22 and 24 may have screw-type lobes formed<br>
thereon while remaining within the scope of that which is claimed.<br>
[0012]	During operation of the supercharger assembly 10, the first and second<br>
rotor assemblies 22 and 24 cooperate to convey volumes of intake air 16 from the inlet<br>
passage 14 to the outlet passage 18. The temperature of the intake air 16 tends to<br>
increase as the intake air 16 is transferred from the inlet passage 14 to the outlet<br>
passage 18, thereby forming a thermal gradient along the longitudinal axis of the first<br>
and second rotors 22 and 24 from the respective first ends 30 and 32 to the respective<br>
second ends 34 and 38. As a result, the degree of thermal expansion of the first and<br>
second rotor assemblies 22 and 24 will increase from the first ends 30 and 32 and the<br>
second ends 34 and 38, thereby increasing the likelihood of "scuff" at the second ends<br>
34 and 38 of the first and second rotor assemblies 22 and 24. Scuff is defined as metal<br>
transfer as a result of the first and second rotor assemblies 22 and 24 contacting one<br>
another or the housing 12.<br>
[0013]	Referring to Figure 2 and with continued reference to Figure 1, there is<br>
shown a sectional view of the supercharger assembly 10 taken along line 2-2 of Figure 1.<br>
Each of the plurality of lobes 26 and 28 include a tip portion 44 and 46, respectively,<br>
positioned at the outer extreme of the respective lobes 26 and 28. The rotor cavity 20,<br>
within which the first and second rotor assemblies 22 and 24 are disposed, is defined by<br>
an inner wall 48 of the housing 12. As illustrated in Figure 2, each of the lobes 26 and 28<br>
have an outer radius, indicated as Ri, at the first ends 30 and 32 of the respective first and<br><br>
P000547-PTE-KFB<br>
4<br>
second rotor assemblies 22 and 24. A gap or clearance, generally indicated as d, is<br>
provided between the tip portions 44 and 46 and the inner wall 48. Referring now to<br>
Figure 3 and with continued reference to Figure 1, there is shown a sectional view of the<br>
supercharger assembly 10 taken along line 3-3 of Figure 1. As illustrated in Figure 3,<br>
each of the lobes 26 and 28 have an outer radius, indicated as R2 at the second ends 34<br>
and 38 of the respective first and second rotor assemblies 22 and 24. A gap or clearance,<br>
generally indicated as C2, is provided between the tip portions 44 and 46 and the inner<br>
wall 48. In a preferred embodiment, the outer radius of the lobes 26 and 28 generally<br>
tapers from the first ends 30 and 32 to the second ends 34 and 38 of the respective first<br>
and second rotor assemblies 22 and 24. That is, the outer radii R^ of the lobes 26 and 28,<br>
at the first ends 30 and 32 is greater than the outer radii R2, of the lobes 26 and 28, at the<br>
second ends 34 and 38 of the respective first and second rotor assemblies 22 and 24. As<br>
such, the clearance Ci between the rotor tip portions 44 and 46 and the inner wall 48 at<br>
the first ends 30 and 32 of the first and second rotor assembly 22 and 24 is less than the<br>
clearance C2 at the second ends 34 and 38 of the first and second rotor assemblies 22 and<br>
24.<br>
[0014]	Referring to Figures 1 through 3, in operation, the intake air 16 will heat<br>
the first and second rotor assemblies 22 and 24 causing a greater thermal expansion at the<br>
second ends 34 and 38 than the first ends 30 and 32. By providing the first and second<br>
rotor assemblies 22 and 24 with a generally tapering shape, the clearance Cj and C2<br>
during operation of the supercharger assembly 10 will substantially equalize. The<br>
generally tapered shape of the first and second rotor assemblies 22 and 24 enables a<br>
smaller or tighter clearance dimension Ci at the first ends 30 and 32 of the first and<br>
second rotor assemblies 22 and 24, while substantially avoiding the possibility of scuff at<br>
the second ends 34 and 38 during operation of the supercharger assembly 10. The lobes<br>
26 and 28 may taper continuously from the first ends 30 and 32 to the second ends 34 and<br>
38 of the first and second rotor assemblies 22 and 24. Alternatively, the lobes 26 and 28<br>
may taper from any point between the first and second ends 30, 32 and 34, 38 to the<br>
second ends 34 and 38 of the first and second rotor assemblies 22 and 24. The lobes 26<br><br>
P000547-PTE-KFB<br>
5<br>
and 28 may taper in a generally linear or a curved fashion while remaining within the<br>
scope of that which is claimed.<br>
[0015]	Referring to Figure 4 and with continued reference to Figures 1 through 3,<br>
there is shown a sectional schematic view of the super charger assembly 10. The swept<br>
volume of the first and second rotor assemblies 22 and 24 is delineated by phantom lines<br>
and indicated at 50. The swept volume 50 illustrates first, second, and third profiles 52,<br>
54, and 56, respectively. The first profile 52 illustrates a rotor shape tapering<br>
continuously from the first ends 30 and 32 to the second ends 34 and 38. The second<br>
profile 54 illustrates a rotor shape that generally tapers from a point between the first<br>
ends 30 and 32 and the second ends 34 and 38 to the second ends 34 and 38. Alternately,<br>
the third profile 56 illustrates a rotor shape tapering in a generally curved fashion toward<br>
the second ends 34 and 38.<br>
[0016]	By tapering the lobes 26 and 28 of the first and second rotor assemblies 22<br>
and 24, improvements in the efficiency of the supercharger assembly 10 may be achieved<br>
such as, for example, increase in the flow of intake air 16, reduced temperature rise of the<br>
intake air 16 flowing through the supercharger assembly 10, reduced parasitic losses, and<br>
improved resistance to scuff. Those skilled in the art will recognize that lobes 26 and 28<br>
having a curved taper to optimally fit the thermal growth pattern of the first and second<br>
rotor assemblies 22 and 24 may be may be employed while remaining within the scope of<br>
that which is claimed.<br>
[0017]	While the best modes for carrying out the invention have been described<br>
in detail, those familiar with the art to which this invention relates will recognize various<br>
alternative designs and embodiments for practicing the invention within the scope of the<br>
appended claims.<br><br>
