				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
HIGH TENSILE STRENGTH STEEL MATERIAL HAVING EXCELLENT DELAYED<br>
FRACTURE RESISTANCE PROPERTY, AND METHOD OF MANUFACTURING THE<br>
SAME<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a high tensile strength<br>
steel material having an excellent delayed fracture resistance<br>
property, and a method of manufacturing the steel material.<br>
In particular, the invention relates to a steel material<br>
preferable for a high tensile strength steel material that has<br>
a tensile strength of 600 MPa or more, and is excellent in<br>
delayed fracture resistance property, and a method of<br>
manufacturing the steel material.<br>
Background Art<br>
Recently, in a field using a steel material such as<br>
construction industrial machinery, a tank, penstock and a line<br>
pipe, a steel material to be used is oriented to be increased<br>
in strength, and use environment of a steel material becomes<br>
progressively harsher with increase in size of structures as<br>
background.<br>
However, it is known that such increase in strength of<br>
a steel material and increase in harshness of use environment<br>
1<br><br>
typically increase hydrogen embrittlement sensitivity of the<br>
steel material, and for example, in a field of high-strength<br>
bolt, a high strength steel material is restrictively used,<br>
for example, JIS B 1186 describes that F11T class bolt (with<br>
tensile strength of 1100 to 1300 N/mm2) is preferably not used.<br>
Therefore, documents described below, that is, patent<br>
document 1, patent document 2, patent document 3, patent<br>
document 4, and patent document 5 have proposed a method of<br>
manufacturing a steel sheet having an excellent hydrogen<br>
embrittlement resistance property using various techniques<br>
such as optimization of a composition, reinforcement of grain<br>
boundaries, refinement of crystal grains, use of hydrogen trap<br>
sites, structural morphology control, and fine dispersion of<br>
carbides.<br>
[Patent document 1]  JP-A-3-243745<br>
[Patent document 2]  JP-A-2003-73737<br>
[Patent document 3]  JP-A-2003-239041<br>
[Patent document 4]  JP-A-2003-253376<br>
[Patent document 5]  JP-A-2003-321743<br>
Disclosure of the Invention<br>
However, even if each of the methods described in the<br>
patent documents 1 to 5 is used, when a strength level becomes<br>
higher, a delayed fracture resistance property, which is<br>
required when a steel material is used in harsh corrosion<br>
2<br><br>
environment, is hardly obtained. Therefore, a high tensile<br>
strength steel material having a more excellent, delayed<br>
fracture resistance property particularly in a high level of<br>
tensile strength of 900 MPa or more, and a method of<br>
manufacturing the high tensile strength steel material have<br>
been required so far.<br>
The invention was made in the light of such a<br>
circumference. That is, an object of the invention is to<br>
provide a high tensile strength steel material having an<br>
excellent delayed fracture resistance property compared with<br>
usual steel materials in a tensile strength of 600 MPa or more,<br>
and particularly 900 MPa or more, and provide a method of<br>
manufacturing the steel material (note; delayed fracture is<br>
known to be induced mainly due to an effect of hydrogen. From<br>
a view point of use environment of a steel material, harsher<br>
use environment of a steel material generally provides higher<br>
sensitivity of hydrogen to brittleness of the steel material.<br>
In the application, a property of reducing such sensitivity<br>
to delayed fracture of the high strength steel, and improving<br>
the delayed fracture resistance property is called "delayed<br>
fracture resistance property".)<br>
To solve a problem as above, the invention took the<br>
following means. That is, delayed fracture occurs as a result<br>
of a phenomenon that hydrogen that can diffuse in steel at room<br>
temperature, so-called diffusible hydrogen is accumulated in<br>
3<br><br>
a stress concentration portion, and the amount of the hydrogen<br>
reaches to a threshold value of the relevant material. As a<br>
measure for preventing this, one specific countermeasure idea<br>
for improving the delayed fracture resistance property, that<br>
is, means for decreasing the amount of diffusible hydrogen<br>
accumulated in the stress concentration portion is considered.<br>
The inventors made earnest study to improve the delayed<br>
fracture resistance property of a steel material. As a result,<br>
they found the following. That is, added amount of Mo, Nb,<br>
V or Ti being an element for forming precipitates such as alloy<br>
carbides, and a heating rate at a central portion in a thickness<br>
direction of a steel material during tempering are specified,<br>
thereby precipitates can be finely dispersed, and appropriate<br>
amount of residual austenite can be secured. Increase in the<br>
amount of trapped diffusible hydrogen due to the precipitates<br>
and the residual austenite decreases the amount of diffusible<br>
hydrogen accumulated in the stress concentration portion.<br>
Thus, in the invention, a high tensile strength steel material<br>
can be obtained, which has an excellent delayed fracture<br>
resistance property compared with usual materials.<br>
Furthermore, the inventor of the application found the<br>
following. That is, the added amount of elemental components<br>
to be contained, that is, the added amount of S, Ca and 0 is<br>
kept in an appropriate range, thereby a composite inclusion<br>
of CaS and MnS is made actively usable as a trap site of hydrogen.<br>
4<br><br>
This further improves the delayed fracture resistance property<br>
of the steel material.<br>
The invention was made after further investigation based<br>
on knowledge obtained as generally described above. That is,<br>

Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
[Composition]<br>
First, regarding a composition of the invention, the<br>
reason for limiting each component is described. Each symbol %<br>
showing a chemical composition is mass percent-<br>
C: 0.02 to 0.25%<br>
C is contained to secure certain tensile strength.<br>
However, when C is less than 0.02%, such a containing effect<br>
is insufficient. On the other hand, when C is more than 0.25%,<br>
a base metal and a weld heat affected zone are degraded in<br>
toughness, and weldability is significantly degraded.<br>
Therefore, the content of C is limited to be 0.02 to 0.25%.<br>
8<br><br>
Si: 0.01 to 0.8%<br>
Si is contained as a deoxidizing agent in a steel making<br>
stage and as an element for improving strength. However, when<br>
Si is less than 0.01%, such a containing effect is insufficient.<br>
On the other hand, when Si is more than 0.8%, grain boundaries<br>
are embrittled, accelerating occurrence of delayed fracture.<br>
Therefore, the content of Si is limited to be 0.01 to 0.8%.<br>
Mn: 0.5 to 2.0%<br>
Mn is contained to secure certain tensile strength.<br>
However, when Mn is less than 0.5%, such a containing effect<br>
is insufficient. On the other hand, when Mn is more than 2.0%,<br>
toughness of a weld heat affected zone is degraded, and<br>
weldability is significantly degraded. Therefore, the<br>
content of Mn is limited to be 0.5 to 2.0%.<br>
Al: 0.005 to 0.1%<br>
Al is added as a deoxidizing agent, in addition, has an<br>
effect on refinement of crystal grain size. However, when Al<br>
is less than 0.005%, such a containing effect is insufficient.<br>
On the other hand, when Al is contained more than 0.1%, surface<br>
flaws of a steel sheet are easily made. Therefore, the content<br>
of Al is limited to be 0.005 to 0.1%.<br>
N: 0.0005 to 0.008%<br>
N is added because it refines a structure by forming<br>
nitrides with Ti or the like and thus improves toughness of<br>
the base metal and the weld heat affected zone. When N is added<br>
9<br><br>
less than 0.0005%, the effect of refining a structure is not<br>
sufficiently provided, and on the other hand, when N is added<br>
more than 0.008%, the amount of dissolved N is increased, and<br>
therefore toughness of the base metal and the weld heat affected<br>
zone is degraded. Therefore, the content of N is limited to<br>
be 0.0005 to 0.008%.<br>
P: 0.03% or less, S: 0.03% or less<br>
Each of P and S is an impurity element, and when it is<br>
more than 0.03%, sound base metal and sound welding j oint cannot<br>
be obtained. Therefore, the content of each of P and S is<br>
limited to be 0.03% or less. Here, regarding S, since<br>
inclusions of S can be used as trap sites of hydrogen, it is<br>
preferably specified to be 0.0004%≤S≤0.0025%. When S is less<br>
than 0.0004%, appropriate amount of dispersed inclusions<br>
cannot be secured, and the trap sites of hydrogen are decreased,<br>
consequently inclusions do not substantially exhibit an effect<br>
on delayed fracture resistance. When S is more than 0.0025%,<br>
the amount of inclusions is excessivelyincreased and therefore<br>
ductile fracture strength is reduced, consequently toughness<br>
may be degraded.<br>
0: 0.0008%≤0≤0.0030%<br>
0 is preferably specified to be 0.0008%≤O≤0.0030% since<br>
inclusions can be used for trap sites of hydrogen. When 0 is<br>
less than 0.0008%, appropriate amount of dispersed inclusions<br>
cannot be secured, and the trap sites of hydrogen are decreased,<br>
10<br><br>
consequently inclusions do not exhibit the effect on delayed<br>
fracture resistance as the inclusions. When 0 is more than<br>
0.0030%, the amount of inclusions is excessively increased and<br>
therefore ductile fracture strength is reduced, consequently<br>
toughness may be degraded.<br>
At least one selected from Mo, Nb, V and Ti<br>
When the steel material contains at least one of Mo, Nb,<br>
V and Ti, the steel material has an effect of trapping<br>
diffusible hydrogen and thus improving the delayed fracture<br>
resistance property. Therefore, the steel material contains<br>
at least one of Mo of 0.01 to 1%, Nb of 0.001 to 0.1%, V of<br>
0.001 to 0.5% and Ti of 0.001 to 0.1%.<br>
Hereinafter, description is made on ranges in which Mo,<br>
Nb, V and Ti are specified respectively.<br>
Mo: 0.01 to 1%<br>
Mo has a function of improving hardehability and strength,<br>
in addition, traps diffusible hydrogen by forming carbides,<br>
thereby improves the delayed fracture resistance property.<br>
When Mo is added less than 0.01%, such a containing effect is<br>
insufficient, and on the other hand, when it is added more than<br>
1%, economic efficiency is reduced. Therefore, when Mo is<br>
added, the content is limited to be 0.01 to 1%. In particular,<br>
Mo has a function of increasing tempering softening resistance,<br>
and is preferably added 0.2% or more to secure tensile strength<br>
of 900 MPa or more.<br>
11<br><br>
Nb: 0.001 to 0.1%<br>
Nb improves strength as a microalloying element, in<br>
addition, traps diffusible hydrogen by forming carbides,<br>
nitrides, or carbon-nitrides, so that improves the delayed<br>
fracture resistance property. When Nb is added less than<br>
0.001%, such an effect is insufficient, and on the other hand,<br>
when it is added more than 0.1%, toughness of a weld heat<br>
affected zone is degraded. Therefore, when Nb is added, the<br>
content is limited to be 0.001 to 0.1%.<br>
V: 0.001 to 0.5%<br>
V improves strength as a microalloying element, in<br>
addition, traps diffusible hydrogen by forming carbides,<br>
nitrides, or carbon-nitrides, thereby improves the delayed<br>
fracture resistance property. When V is added less than 0.001%,<br>
such an effect is insufficient, and on the other hand, when<br>
it is added more than 0.5%, toughness of a weld heat affected<br>
zone is degraded. Therefore, when V is added, the content is<br>
limited to be 0.001 to 0.5%.<br>
Ti: 0.001 to 0.1%<br>
Ti forms TiN during rolling heating or during welding,<br>
thereby inhibits growth of austenite grains, and thereby<br>
improves toughness of a base metal and weld heat affected zone,<br>
in addition, traps diffusible hydrogen by forming carbides,<br>
nitrides, or carbon-nitrides, thereby improves the delayed<br>
fracture resistance property.<br>
12<br><br>
Furthermore, Ti has an effect of trapping diffusible<br>
hydrogen by forming a composite precipitate with Mo or Nb,<br>
thereby improving the delayed fracture resistance property.<br>
However, when Ti is added less than 0.001%, such an effect is<br>
insufficient, and on the other hand, when it is added more than<br>
0.1%, toughness of a weld heat affected zone is degraded.<br>
Therefore, when Ti is added, the content is limited to be 0.001<br>
to 0.1%.<br>
Furthermore, in the invention, the steel material may<br>
contain the following components depending on a desired<br>
property. That is, components that the steel material may<br>
further contain depending on a desired property are as follows.<br>
Cu: 2% or less<br>
Cu has a function of improving strength by solution<br>
hardening and precipitation hardening. However, when the<br>
content of Cu exceeds 2%, cracking in hot working tends to occur<br>
during heating a steel billet or welding. Therefore, when Cu<br>
is added, the content is limited to be 2% or less.<br>
Ni: 4% or less<br>
Ni has a function of improving toughness and<br>
hardenability. However, when the content of Ni exceeds 4%,<br>
economic efficiency is reduced. Therefore, when Ni is added,<br>
the content is limited to be 4% or less.<br>
Cr: 2% or less<br>
Cr has a function of improving strength and toughness,<br>
13<br><br>
and is excellent in high temperature strength property.<br>
Therefore, when a steel material is intended to be increased<br>
in strength, Cr is actively added, and particularly, Cr of 0.3%<br>
or more is preferably added to obtain a property of tensile<br>
strength of 900 MPa or more. However, when the content of Cr<br>
exceeds 2%, weldability is degraded. Therefore, when Cr is<br>
added, the content is limited to be 2% or less.<br>
W: 4% or less<br>
W has a function of improving strength. However, when<br>
the content of W exceeds 2%, weldability is degraded.<br>
Therefore, when W is added, the content is limited to be 2%<br>
or less.<br>
B: 0.003% or less<br>
B has a function of improving hardenability. However,<br>
when the content of B exceeds 0.003%, toughness is degraded.<br>
Therefore, when B is added, the content is limited to be 0.003%<br>
or less.<br>
Ca: 0.01% or less<br>
Ca is an element indispensable for morphology control<br>
of sulfide based inclusions. However, when Ca is added more<br>
than 0.01%, reduction in cleanliness is caused. Therefore,<br>
when Ca is added, the content is limited to be 0.01% or less.<br>
Preferably, regarding Ca, since inclusions of Ca can be<br>
used as trap sites of hydrogen, it is specified to be<br>
0.0010%≤Ca≤0.0030%. When Ca is less than 0 . 0010%, appropriate<br>
14<br><br>
amount of dispersed inclusions cannot be secured, and the trap<br>
sites of hydrogen are decreased, consequently inclusions do<br>
not substantially exhibit an effect on delayed fracture<br>
resistance.<br>
When Ca is more than 0.0030%, the amount of inclusions<br>
is excessively increased and therefore ductile fracture<br>
strength is reduced, consequently toughness may be degraded.<br>
However, when Ca is specified to be 0.0010≤Ca≤0.0030%,<br>
the amount of 0 in steel is specified to be 0.0008≤O≤0.0030%,<br>
and ACR obtained by the following expression is specified to<br>
be 0.2≤ACR≤1.0.<br>
Here,	in         the         expression,<br>
ACR=(Ca-(0.18+130*Ca)*O)/1.25/S, Ca, 0 or S shows the content<br>
(mass percent) in steel respectively.<br>
ACR is specified to be 0.2≤ACR≤1.0 so that the composite<br>
inclusion of CaS and MnS is actively used as the trap site of<br>
hydrogen to improve the delayed fracture resistance property.<br>
Ca, 0 and S are contained such that ACR satisfies such range,<br>
thereby CaS and MnS are prevented from being crystallized as<br>
nucleuses respectively, and can be dispersed as fine composite<br>
inclusions.<br>
As a result, hydrogen is trapped in interfaces between<br>
the composite inclusions and a matrix, so that accumulation<br>
of hydrogen in interfacial surface of only part of inclusions<br>
can  be  suppressed.    Furthermore,  alloy  carbides  are<br>
15<br><br>
precipitated on surfaces of the composite inclusions in a<br>
rapid-heating tempering process, thereby a larger amount of<br>
hydrogen are trapped. When ACR is less than 0.2, a nucleus<br>
of inclusions is MnS, and the inclusions are extended by rolling<br>
and thereby tend to be initial points of delayed fracture,<br>
consequently the delayed fracture resistance property is<br>
sometimes degraded.<br>
When ACR is 1.0 or more, a nucleus of inclusions is CaS,<br>
and the inclusions tend to be coarse, and in some cases, the<br>
coarse inclusions become initial points of delayed fracture,<br>
consequently the delayed fracture resistance property is<br>
degraded.<br>
More preferably, ACR is in a range of 0.4≤ACR≤0.8.<br>
In usual cases, since MnS is extended by rolling, and<br>
hydrogen is accumulated in such extended portions, thereby<br>
cracks tend to occur, Ca is added so as to satisfy ACR≥1.0,<br>
so that S is fixed to perform morphology control of MnS.<br>
REM: 0.02% or less<br>
REM forms sulfides as REM (0, S) in steel and thus<br>
decreases the amount of dissolved S in crystal grain boundaries,<br>
so that it improves an SR crack resistance property. However,<br>
when REM is added more than 0.02%, REM sulfides are<br>
significantly accumulated in a precipitation zone, causing<br>
degradation in material. Therefore, when REM is added, added<br>
amount is limited to be 0.02% or less.<br>
16<br><br>
Mg: 0.01% or less<br>
Mg is sometimes used as a molten-iron desulfurizing agent.<br>
However, when Mg is added more than 0.01%, reduction in<br>
cleanliness is caused. Therefore, when Mg is added, added<br>
amount is limited to be 0.01% or less.<br>
Next, description is made on the reason for limiting a<br>
precipitation pattern of precipitates in the invention. First,<br>
from a viewpoint of a microstructure of the precipitates, the<br>
reason for limiting the precipitation pattern is described<br>
below.<br>
[Microstructure] In the invention, precipitates containing<br>
at least one of elements selected from Mo, Nb, V and Ti have<br>
an average grain size of 20 nm or less, and preferably 15 nm<br>
or less. The number of precipitates contained in the steel<br>
is at least 5 per 250000 nm2, and preferably at least 10 per<br>
250000 nm2. (note; Here, the precipitates typically include<br>
a carbide, nitride, carbon-nitride, and compound of them.)<br>
The precipitates are observed by a transmission electron<br>
microscope by using a sample of a thin film or extraction<br>
replica or the like. The grain size is evaluated using a<br>
circle-equivalent diameter from image analysis, and the<br>
average grain size is, for example, assumed as a simple average<br>
value for at least five, optional view fields using<br>
precipitates observed in a view field 500 nm square as an<br>
object.<br>
17<br><br>
While the precipitates containing at least one of<br>
elements selected from Mo, Nb, V and Ti have an effect of<br>
trapping diffusible hydrogen irrespectively of size, when the<br>
average grain size is more than 20 nm, lattice matching is<br>
reduced, leading to reduction in force of trapping diffusible<br>
hydrogen. As a result, in the steel material, the effect of<br>
improving the delayed fracture resistance property is reduced.<br>
Thus, the average grain size is specified to be 20 nm or less,<br>
and preferably 15 nm or less.<br>
When density of the precipitates containing at least one<br>
of elements selected from Mo, Nb, V and Ti is less than 5 per<br>
250000 nm2, the amount of diffusible hydrogen trapped by the<br>
precipitates is decreased, leading to reduction in effect of<br>
improving the delayed fracture resistance property. Thus, the<br>
precipitates are specified to be contained in a ratio of at<br>
least 5 per 250000 nm2 or more, and preferably at least 10 per<br>
250000 nm2.<br>
Next, in a viewpoint of the residual austenite, the<br>
reason for limiting the precipitation pattern is described<br>
below.<br>
[Residual austenite]<br>
Residual austenite acts as a hydrogen trap site because<br>
of high solid solubility of hydrogen, and thereby improves the<br>
delayed fracture resistance property. However, such an effect<br>
is not sufficient in a volume fraction of residual austenite<br>
18<br><br>
of less than 0.5%, but strength is reduced in a volume fraction<br>
of more than 5%. Therefore, the residual austenite is<br>
preferably specified to be in a volume fraction of 0.5 to 5%,<br>
and more preferably in a volume fraction of 2 to 4%.<br>
The volume fraction of the amount of residual austenite<br>
is measured by, for example, quantizing peaks of the lattice<br>
constant of austenite using X-ray diffraction.<br>
Next, a manufacturing method of the invention is<br>
described.<br>
In the invention, a steel billet can be manufactured such<br>
that the billet can be quenched from the Ar3 transformation<br>
temperature or more, and a method of manufacturing a cast billet<br>
from molten steel, or a method of manufacturing a steel billet<br>
by rolling a cast billet is not particularly specified. Steel<br>
ingoted by a converter method, an electric furnace method and<br>
the like, or a slab manufactured by continuous casting, an ingot<br>
mold method and the like can be used.<br>
When a steel billet is manufactured by rolling a cast<br>
billet, the cast billet as it is may be started to be subjected<br>
to hot rolling without being cooled to the Ar3 transformation<br>
temperature or less, or may be started to be subjected to hot<br>
rolling after a cast billet that was once cooled is reheated<br>
to the Ar3 transformation temperature or more.<br>
If rolling is finished at the Ar3 transformation<br>
temperature or more, other rolling conditions may not be<br>
19<br><br>
particularly specified. If rolling is performed at a<br>
temperature of the Ar3 transformation temperature or more, the<br>
rolling may be performed in a recrystallization range or a<br>
non-recrystallization range.<br>
In the invention, if quenching is started from a state<br>
of an austenite single phase structure at the Ar3 transformation<br>
temperature or more, the quenching may be performed directly<br>
after hot rolling, or may be performed after reheating a<br>
hot-rolled material.<br>
As a heating method during tempering, if a required<br>
heating rate is achieved, any of methods of induction heating,<br>
resistance heating, infrared radiation heating, atmospheric<br>
heating and the like can be used.<br>
Next, description is made on a manufacturing condition<br>
preferable for manufacturing steel in the invention. The<br>
invention can be applied to steel materials in various forms<br>
such as a steel sheet, shape steel, and rod steel. In the<br>
manufacturing condition, temperature is specified with<br>
temperature at a central portion of the steel material, which<br>
is a center in thickness in the steel sheet, a center in<br>
thickness in a region, to which properties according to the<br>
invention are added, in the shape steel, and a center in a radial<br>
direction in the rod steel. However, since the neighborhood<br>
of the central portion is subjected to substantially the same<br>
temperature history, the central portion is not limited to the<br>
20<br><br>
center itself.<br>
A manufacturing condition preferable for manufacturing<br>
the steel of the invention is described below from a viewpoint<br>
of quenching and tempering.<br>
A quenching condition in the invention is as follows.<br>
To secure strength and toughness of a base metal,<br>
quenching is performed from a temperature of the Ar3<br>
transformation temperature or more to a temperature of 500°C<br>
or less.  In the quenching, cooling is performed at a rate of<br>
0.5°C/sec or more, and preferably l°C/sec or more.<br>
These are specified to complete transformation from<br>
austenite to martensite or bainite to reinforce a base metal.<br>
While an expression for obtaining the Ar3 transformation<br>
temperature (°C) is not particularly specified in the invention,<br>
for example, Ar3=910-310C-80Mn-20Cu-15Cr-55Ni-80Mo is assumed.<br>
In the expression, each elemental symbol shows the content<br>
(mass percent) in steel.<br>
A tempering condition in the invention is as follows.<br>
During tempering, an average heating rate is set to be<br>
l°C/sec or more, and preferably set to be 2°C/sec or more from<br>
a tempering start temperature to a predetermined tempering<br>
temperature. In the case that steel is temporarily cooled to<br>
room temperature due to reheating quenching, the average<br>
heating rate is also set to be l°C/sec or more, and preferably<br>
set to be 2°C/sec or more during tempering.<br>
21<br><br>
Behavior of formation or growth of precipitates formed<br>
during tempering, including, alloy carbides, alloy nitrides,<br>
alloy carbon-nitrides and the like is affected by a heating<br>
rate during tempering, and when the average heating rate is<br>
also set to be l°C/sec or more, and preferably set to be 2°C/sec<br>
or more, fine dispersion of precipitates is achieved.<br>
When the rate is less than l°C/sec, since C is diffused<br>
into grain boundaries or lath interfaces before carbides or<br>
carbon-nitrides precipitate, only coarse carbides or<br>
carbon-nitrides can be obtained, consequently an effect of<br>
finely dispersing carbides or carbon-nitrides to be as trap<br>
sites of hydrogen is not obtained.<br>
Furthermore, in tempering, when a temperature range<br>
where a heating rate at 600°C or more is at least 10°C/sec is<br>
included, an alloy element is substituted for Fe in dispersedly<br>
precipitated cementite, which preferably accelerates<br>
precipitation of fine alloy carbides.<br>
When a steel material is increased in strength to have<br>
a tensile strength of 900 MPa or more, it is preferable for<br>
obtaining a well-balanced property of high strength and high<br>
toughness that tempering temperature is set to be in a range<br>
of 450 to 550°C.<br>
Furthermore, for a heating process during tempering, it<br>
is enough that a predetermined average heating rate is obtained,<br>
and either of a linear temperature history, and a temperature<br>
22<br><br>
history in which temperature is retained during heating may<br>
be used, that is, a temperature history is not particularly<br>
specified.<br>
Holding time at tempering temperature is desirably 60<br>
sec or less to prevent degradation in productivity, or<br>
degradation in delayed fracture resistance property due to<br>
coarsening of precipitates.<br>
Regarding a cooling rate after tempering, it is desirable<br>
that an average cooling rate is set to be 0.05°C/sec or more<br>
from the tempering temperature to 200°C to prevent coarsening<br>
of precipitates during cooling.<br>
According to the above conditions, since the amount of<br>
trapped diffusible hydrogen due to the precipitates is<br>
increased, the amount of diffusible hydrogen accumulated in<br>
a stress concentration portion is decreased, consequently the<br>
delayed fracture resistance property is improved compared with<br>
that of usual steel materials.<br>
[Example]<br>
Effectiveness of the invention is described using an<br>
example. Steel A to steel P and Steel Q to steel U of chemical<br>
composition shown in Tables 1 and 4 were ingoted and casted<br>
into slabs, then the slabs were heated in a heating furnace<br>
and then rolled into steel sheets. After rolling,<br>
successively, the steel sheets were directly quenched, and then<br>
23<br><br>
subjected to tempering using a solenoid-type induction heating<br>
apparatus.<br>
An average heating rate at a central portion in thickness<br>
was controlled by using threading speed of a steel sheet. When<br>
a steel sheet was held at the tempering temperature, the steel<br>
sheet was heated while being reciprocated, so that it was held<br>
within a variation range of ±5°C.<br>
As cooling after heating, air cooling was used.<br>
Temperature such as tempering temperature or quenching<br>
temperature at a central portion in thickness was obtained by<br>
heat transfer calculation from a result of sequential<br>
temperature measurement of a surface using a radiation<br>
thermometer.<br>
Table 2 shows manufacturing conditions of the steel<br>
sheets, average grain size of precipitates, density of the<br>
precipitates, and volume fractions of residual austenite, and<br>
Table 3 shows yield strength, tensile strength, fracture<br>
transition temperature (vTrs), and amount of critical<br>
diffusible hydrogen.<br>
For the size and density of the precipitates,<br>
precipitates extracted by using an extraction replica were<br>
photographed using a transmission electron microscope, then<br>
average was obtained for five, optional view fields using<br>
precipitates observed in a view field 500 nm square as an object.<br>
Grain size was evaluated using a circle-equivalent diameter<br>
24<br><br>
from image analysis.<br>
The volume fraction of residual austenite was measured<br>
by quantizing peaks of the lattice constant of austenite using<br>
X-ray diffraction.<br>
The yield strength and the tensile strength were measured<br>
using full-thicknes.s tensile test pieces, and the toughness<br>
was evaluated by vTrs obtained by a Charpy impact test using<br>
test pieces sampled from central portions in thickness.<br>
Furthermore, the amount of critical diffusible hydrogen<br>
was defined as maximum amount of diffusible hydrogen at which<br>
delayed fracture did not occur within 100 hr under constant<br>
load of 90% of tensile strength, and a round-bar tensile test<br>
piece with circular notch was used as a test piece, and the<br>
amount of diffusible hydrogen was measured by gas<br>
chromatography method.<br>
An objective value of the amount of critical diffusible<br>
hydrogen was set to be at least 0.2 ppm by mass for a steel<br>
type having a tensile strength of 1200 MP or more, and set to<br>
be at least 0.3 ppm by mass for a steel type having a tensile<br>
strength of less than 1200 MP.<br>
