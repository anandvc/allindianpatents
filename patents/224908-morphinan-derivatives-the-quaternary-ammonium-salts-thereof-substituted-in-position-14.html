				<td>The present invention relates to a class of morphinan compounds and the quaternary salts thereof substituted in Position 14, which may be used as highly active analgesics or also as opioid antagonists. The present invention further relates to pharmaceutical^ acceptable salts and easily-produced derivatives thereof, a process of production thereof and use thereof in the' production of pharmaceutical specialities.<br>
The existence of opioid receptors as receptors of the central nervous system (CNS), which impart analgesic effects, has been clearly proven. These receptors are subdivided into three subtypes, u, K and 5. Activation of these receptors by opioid agonists leads to an analgesic effect. The activation of the u-receptors causes the highest analgesic effect, whereby particularly N-methyl substituted morphinans with an oxygen function in Position 6 (morphine, oxymorphone, hydromorphone, etc.) are particularly active opioid agonists and are used as effective analgesics. In the past a great deal of work has been invested in structure-activity relationship studies of this class of substance.<br>
In the Journal of Medicinal Chemistry 1984, 27, pp. 1575-1579 various 14-methoxy-N-methylmorphinan-6-ones a re d escribed w ith v arious s ubstituents i n Position 3. These derivatives show higher analgesic activity than their 14-hydroxy analogues.<br>
A detailed study of 5-methyloxymorphone (= t4-hydroxy-5-methyidihydromorphinone) is described in Helvetica Chimica Acta (1988,71, pp. 1801-1804), which arrives at the result that the introduction of a 5-methyl group reduces the opioid agonistic properties of oxymorphone.<br>
A further study of 14-alkoxy-N-methylmorphinan-6-ones is described in Helvetica Chimica Acta 1989, 72, pp. 1 233-1239, in whichthe influenceof various substituents in Position 3 and of the amino nitrogen have been evaluated.<br>
The German published patent application DE 34 12 727 describes 14-alkoxy-N-methylmorphinan-6-ones (14-O-alkyloxymorphones) with higher activity than their 14-hydroxy analogues.<br>
If instead of the N-methyl group, e.g. an N-cyclopropy I methyl group, an N-allyl group or an N-tetrahydrofurfuryl group is introduced, then normally compounds result which cause antagonistic effects on opioid receptors (see Prog. Med. Chem. 1998, 35, 83-132). Such opioid antagonists<br><br>
cancel both the analgesic effect as well as the side effects of opioid agonists (e.g. respiratory depression or obstipation).<br>
Surprisingly, it has now been found that e.g. N-cyclopropylmethyl, N-allyl or N-tetrahydrofurfuryl substituted morphinan-6-ones with arylalkyl substituents or longer chained alkyl substituents in Position 14 are highly active opioid agonists with excellent analgesic activity. The very high analgesic activity enables low dosing, which leads to a lower rate of side effects.<br>
Furthermore, its has been surprisingly found that a quatemisation of morphinan-6-ones, which exhibit arylalkyl substituents or alkyl substituents in Position 14, on one hand leads to substances with higher analgesic activity, but on the other hand to substances with excellent opioid antagonism. The previously described quatemisation of 14-hydroxymorphinan-6-ones (e.g. oxymorphone or naloxone)led to a significant weakening of the effectiveness (see M.A. lorio et a!., Eur. J. Med. Chem. - Chim. Ther. 1984,19, 301-303). Furthermore, it has been found that these new substances develop their effect primarily in the periphery, because they cannot, or can only to a slight extent, overcome the blood-brain barrier.<br>

It has now been found that the compounds of the objective invention (morphinan compounds and their quaternary salts substituted in Position 14) represent effective opioid receptor ligands and exhibit a high therapeutic usage potential as analgesics, narcotics, as immunomodulators with immunostimulating or immunosuppressive effects, as cancer therapeutics, inflammation inhibitors, as antirheumatics, for the suppression of organ rejection after transplants, as diuretics, anorectics, as agents against diantioea, obstipation, ileus, pruritis, as anaesthetics or as neuroprotective active substances.<br>
The compounds stated in the claims are therefore potentially usable for the treatment of acute and chronic pain, of functional intestinal diseases, such as diarrhoea, abdominal pain, obstipation, ileus, for the treatment of inflammatory intestinal diseases, for the treatment of mammals, especially human beings, for the treatment of the Raynaud syndrome, for the treatment of complaints caused by vasoconstriction, for the treatment of dysmenorrhea, angina pectoris, cardiac infarction, emphysema, bronchial spasms, chronic obstructive bronchitis, rheumatic complaints, oedemas, nephrosis, nephritis in conjunction with rheumatic diseases, for the treatment of tumours, phaeochromocytome, the Addison disease, hepatic cirrhosis, chronic inflammations of the small and large intestines and rectum, for the treatment of pruritis, psoriasis, neurodermatitis, for addition withdrawal from for example opioids, cocaine or alcohol, for the treatment of overweight, or for the treatment of psychic diseases such as dysphoria, depression or schizophrenia.<br>
Surprisingly it was also found that the compounds of this objective invention were not capable of overcoming the blood-brain barrier or only to a slight extent, and therefore a special significance could be attributed to them with regard to their use as peripherally effective therapeutics, for example as medicaments for the treatment of pain, for the treatment or prevention of obstipation caused by analgesics, for the treatment or prevention of postoperative ileus, postpartum ileus, for rheumatic therapy, for suppressing organ rejection after transplants with mammals, especially human beings, also for the treatment of erection problems. The limited access to the central nervous system goes with a very reduced side-effect rate, which is relevant to central side effects, such as for example nausea, vomiting, sedation, dizziness, confusion, respiratory depression and mania.<br>

Compounds of the formula (XVI) can be converted to the compounds according to the invention of formula (I) in which R5 is hydrogen by removing the hydroxyl group in Position 4. This can occur for example by the formation of the corresponding phenyltetrazolylether in the presence of a base such as potassium carbonate in a solution such as N,N-dimethylformamide and then catalytic hydration of the phenyltetrazolylether, for example over a catalyst such as Pd/C in an alcohol or glacial acetic acid at temperatures between 20°C and 100°C (see for example Schmidhammer et al.

The arrangement of the incoming substituents is preferably axial (see M.A. lorioetal., Eur. J. Med. Chem. - Chim. Ther. 1984,19,301-303).<br>

Opioid receptor binding studies<br>
Opioid receptor binding studies were carried out on rat's brain homogenisates using [3H]DAMGO (u-receptor agonist) as radio-ligand and under strict conformance to an earlier published specification (M. Spetea et at., Neurochemical Research 1998, Vol. 23, pp. 1213-1218).<br><br>
The compounds 8,17,17a 17b, 38,40-43, 48, 49, and 54-56 show very high affinity to u-opioid receptors which are primarily responsible for analgesia (Table 1). All have a clearly higher affinity than the antagonist cyprodime {see H. Schmidhammeret al., J. Med. Chem. 1995, 38, 3071-3077), which is selective to u-opioid receptors. The compounds 8,17,17a 17b, 40,48, and 54-56 show extremely high affinity to u-opioid receptors (in the subnanomolar range). Morphine and the opioid antagonist 3-hydroxycyprodime (see H. Schmidhammer et al., J. Med. Chem. 1995, 36, 3071-3077} show in comparison to these two compounds clearly lower affinity to u-opioid receptors, whereas 14-methoxymetopon exhibits similar affinity.<br><br>
a) "Hot-plate Test"<br>
A test on mice ("hot-plate test") was carried out as described earlier (E.L. May et al., J. Med. Chem.<br>
2000; 43, 5030-5036).<br>
All tested substances show substantially higher analgesic activity than morphine. The compounds 6-11,17a, 17b and 53 show extremely high analgesic activity which is significantly higher than that of<br><br>
the reference substance 14-methoxymetopon (see 2s. FQrstetal., Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1993; 236: 209-215). Compounds 4 and 32 show in comparison to the compounds 6-11 somewhat lower analgesic activity, because these compounds exhibit an ether function (methoxy group) in Position 3, from which it is known that it reduces the analgesic activity in comparison to the 3-hydroxy analogues. However, the analgesic activity of the compounds 4 and 32 is still surprisingly high. Also, the analgesic activity of the compound 17 with a different ether function (propargyioxy group) in Positron 3 is surprisingly high.<br><br>
b\ "Mouse Tail Flick Test"<br>
To determine the analgesic activity of non-quaternised compounds, the "Mouse Tail Flick Test" was<br>
carried out as earlier described (E.L. May et al., J. Med. Chem. 2000; 43, 5030-5036),<br>
All tested substances show substantially higher analgesic activity than morphine. The compounds 6-8,10,11,17a, 17b and 53 show extremely high analgesic activity which is significantly higher than that of the reference substance 14-methoxymetopon (see Zs. FQrstetal., Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1993; 236: 209-215). Compound 4 shows in comparison to the compounds 6-8,10,11,17a, 17b and 53 a somewhat lower analgesic activity, because this compound exhibits a rnethoxy group in Position 3, from which it is known that it reduces the analgesic activity in comparison to the 3-hydroxy analogues. However, the analgesic activity of compound 4 is surprisingly high. Similarly, compounds 17a and 32, which surprisingly have a very high analgesic activity, have a methoxy group in Position 3. The most active compound in this series, compound 17b, with an EDso (ug/kg, sc) of 0.08, is more<br><br>
active than the most active anafgesically effective substances recognized, etorphine and dihydroetorphine (M.D. Aceto et al., Eur. J. Pharmacol 1997; 338, 215-223).<br><br>
cPRat Tail Flick Test"<br>
To determine the analgesic activity of quaternised compounds, a test on rats, the "Rat Tail Flick<br>
Test", was used. The test was carried out as described earlier (Zs. Furst et al., Eur. J. Pharmacol.<br>
1993,236,209-215).<br>
As quaternary ammonium salts, compounds 38 and 42 show a very high analgesic effect - both are substantially more active than morphine after subcutaneous application (Table 3). Compound 42 is somewhat less active than 14-methoxymetopon after subcutaneous application. After intracerebroventricular application, compound 42 is extremely active, which is an indication that it can overcome the blood-brain barrier only to a limited degree and shows its effectiveness therefore primarily in the periphery (outside of the central nervous system). This goes with a very reduced side-effect rate which is relevant to central side effects such as nausea, vomiting, sedation, dizziness, confusion, respiratory depression and mania.<br><br><br>
Example 57<br>
Determination of the antagonistic activity<br>
Vas Deferens Preparation of the mouse<br>
This test was carried out as earlier described using OAMGO (u-receptor agonist) (S. Garadnay et al.,<br>
Curr. Med. Chem. 2001, 8, 621-626).<br>
Compound 48 shows surprisingly very high antagonistic activity to u-opioid receptors, which is unusual for quatemised morphinans (Table 4).<br>
Normally quatemised morphinans have a substantially lower activity in comparison to the non-quaternised morphinans. It has substantially higher antagonistic activity than the u-selective opioid receptor antagonist cyprodime. In comparison to naloxone it has a somewhat lower activity, whereas in comparison to 3-hydroxycyprodime it exhibits a somewhat higher activity. Due to its structure as a quaternary ammonium salt, it can only overcome the blood-brain barrier with difficulty and produces its effect mainly in the periphery. Because of this, it can, for example, be used to counter or prevent obstipation or ileus caused by opioids without the analgesia of the administered opioid being cancelled. In comparison to it, naloxone, cyprodime and 3-hydroxycyprodime pass through the blood-brain barrier relatively easily and therefore also cancel the analgesic effect of opioids.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
