This invention relates to an oil filter for the oil sump of the lubricating system of an automobile engine. The said system is intended for the lubrication and cooling of the engine and engine parts.<br>
The oil in the sump of the lubricating system of an automobile engine, such as, the engine of a scooter type motor vehicle, is usually contaminated with burrs, metal particles and carbon deposits. This oil gets circulated in the engine lubricating system and i© therefore detrimental to the functioning of the engine and its parts. An oil filter is therefore provided for avoiding entry of burrs and other contaminants.into the lubricatirfg system.<br>
The known oil filter is normally made of steel wire mesh or nylon wire mesh. The oil from the sump is drawn by an oi1 pump through the fiIter which allows relatively clean oil  to be cireulated to the engine•<br>
The known oil filters are usually of the flat type wire mesh kind or of the tubular type wire mesh kind.<br>
The  oil filter proposed herein is. of the tubular  type<br><br>
wire mesh kind.<br>
In the known tubular type of oil filter, the first end of the filter body is closed and disposed in the drain hole against the drain plug of the oil sump. The second end has an aperture for receiving the inlet end of a pipe, the outlet of which is connected to the oil pump. The second end is held firmly against the crank case opening under the force exerted by a metal spring placed between the first end of the filter body and the drain plug of the oil sump to prevent leakage of oil.<br>
This invention proposes an oil filter of the tubular type wire mesh kind and differs from the known tubular type wi re mesh kind in that the metal spring is dispensed wi th; instead,a resi1ient member having a flared configuration is provided at the first end of the body of the filter, said member being moulded integrally with the body ot the filter, out of plastic, such  as  nylonip<br>
Thus,  the  elimination  of  the  conventional   spring by means of the resilient member aforesaid renders  the<br><br>
instal1 at ion of the filter easier, since the re«i1ient member is already pre-aligned during moulding and needs no adjustment during installation. Besides, the resilient member is more durable than the metal spring which is prone to deterioration in use.<br>
Various other features of this invention uii 11 be apparent from the following further description .<br>
According to this invention, the oil filter for the oil sump of the lubricating system of an automobile engine, is of the tubular type wire mesh kind and comprises a plastic moulded filter body provided with wire mesh, the first end of the said body being closed while the second end has an aperture to be aligned against the crankcase opening for receiving the inlet end of a pipe leading to the oil pump of the said system, the first end of the filter body being locatable in the drain hole of the sump ad jacent the drain plug, said f i rst end being provided wi th a resi1ient f1 ared member made of plastic integrally moulded with the filter body, to butt against the drain plug and exert a force of resi1ience on the said drain plug.<br><br>
This invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings which illustrate by way of example, and not by way of limitation, a preferred embodiment of the oil filter proposed herein Fig.l illustrating the filter body in section with the pipe installed therein<br>
Fig.2  i1lustrat ing  a perspective vi ew of  the  filter body with pipe installed therein<br>
Fig.3  illustrating  a view of the  filter in position. and<br>
Fig- 4 illustrating the flared portion of the resilient<br>
member*<br>
From the drawings it will be seen that the oil filter is of the tubular type wire mesh kind. The wire mesh (in the embodiment i1 lustrated, ' steel wire mesh) is indicated by W and the body of the filter is generally indicated by B- The body of the filter is moulded out of plastic , such as, nylon.<br>
The  first 'QiX^^     of the body Fl is  closed,  while  the<br><br>
second end F2 has an aperture A for being aligned with the crankcase opening C. The aperture A receives the inlet end E of a pipe P. The outlet of the pipe is connected to the oil pump (not i1 lustrated).<br>
The first end Fl of the filter body is locatable in the drain hole H of the oil sump S . A flared resilient member M is moulded along with the filter body, such that the member and body are integral. The said member butts against the drain plug D and everts a force of resilience thereon, to maintain the filter body firmly in pi ace, particularly, to maintain the aperture A firmly against the crankcase opening C, thus preventing any oil leaks- The resilient member M dispenses wi th the known spring used wi th the filter. Whenever the filter is installed in place, the resilient member M gets compressed and exerts the requisite resilient force against the drain plug D, thus keeping the filter firmly in position and preventing any oil leaks at the zone of contact between the second end of the filter body at the aperture A and the body of the crankcase at the<br><br>
opening C.<br>
The second end F2 of the filter body is provided with an annul ar depression J" to receive a VHofVnietal lie washer or other sealing means of a slightly gremter thickness than the depth.of the depression to act as an oil seal. This is an added measure against oil l»aks at the aperture A and the opening C of the crankcase.<br>
The resi1ient member is given a flared configuration as shown in Fig.4 in order to distribute the resilient force uniformly on the drain plug D. In the embodiment illustrated the resilient member, which is integral with the filter body, consists of a plurality of resi1ient vanes V arrayed substant ially in a ci rcular configuration, to achieve uniform distribution of the resilient force e&gt;;erted on the drain plug. It will be visualised that other forms of the resilient member are possible to achieve the same objecti ve.<br>
The terms and expressions in this specification are of description and not of limitation, there being no intention  to  exclude any equivalent^of  the  features<br><br>
i1 lustrated and described, but it is understood that various other embodiments of the oil filter proposed herein are   passible without departing from  the  scope<br>
and ^ambit olthis invention..<br>
/<br><br><br><br><br>
