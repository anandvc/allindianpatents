				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>This invention relates to an improved process for the preparation of carbamates useful for agrochemicals, Pharmaceuticals and peptide synthesis<br>
This invention particularly describes a process for the preparation of carbamates which find applications in agrochemicals , Pharmaceuticals and in peptide synthesis The process is suitable for the preparation of a variety of alkyl, aryl, ammo acid and carbohydrates carbamates of formula 1 wherein R is aryl, hetero cyclic, alkyl, poly nuclear arene, furanose, pyranose ammo acid (where acid group is protected as methyl or ethyl) or the add group of ammo acid is converted into alcohol and protected with trimethyl silyl group and R1 is methyl, ethyl, isobutyl or benzyl<br>
Carbamates find applications in Pharmaceuticals as well as in agrochemicals. They are well known in agrochemicals as pesticides, insecticides and herbicides that require in large quantihes. The present process can meet with the demands in more economic way.<br>
The present invention also finds application in peptide synthesis where this method stands with other protected groups This allows the process to prepare carbamates at a specific functionalized group dunng the synthetic sequence. Further the present invention also finds application carbohydrate carbamates formation.<br>
Several processes have been published hitherto for the production of compounds of this type<br>
1	Ammo   compounds   are   converted   into   N-acyl   hahde   (&gt;N-COC1)   using<br>
phosgene.Further it is reacted with alcohols in the presence of triethylamme as base in aromatic solvent at higher temperature. But the yields obtained are very low (49%). (Jpn. Kokai Tokyo, koho81.71,058,1981), (Jpn. Kokai. Tokyo, koho 8125,143,1981). 2. Aromatic carbamates are prepared by the condensation of amines with anhydride in °. oresence of metal salts or salt of monovalent organic compounds. This process particularly has the drawback that the side products like PhNHCONHPh and PhNHMe anses.(U.S.Patent 4268683,1981).<br>
3. Amines are treated with CO, alcohols and VII group metal compounds like PdCl? using pressure 1000 psi. The reaction completes after 24 hrs at 120 °C.The disadvantages of this process are the use of palladium salt which is expensive and the reaction time is very long (U.S.patent 4260781,1981)<br>
4 A method using diethylcarbonate needs sodium hydnde as base which is moisture sensitive (SyntkCommun 1994, 24, 2441)<br>
These processes are based on the applications of tn ethylamme, sodium hydride as co-base where other protecting groups can not service Moreover, these procedures use hazardous chemicals like phosgene and isocyanate, which are very expensive and difficult to handle. Some times the procedures require heating, high pressure and longer reaction time and does not lead to satisfactory yield Therefore, all these procedures have no commercial significance These processes of carbamates production using phosgene, isocyanate, anhydride and triethyl amine as base, have the following disadvantages.<br>
1	To complete the reaction, it is necessary to use base, which may effect the other<br>
protecting groups<br>
2	Triethyl amine and sodium hydnde used as co-base are difficult to handle because of its<br>
high sensitivity towards moisture<br>
3	The bases or metal salt of organic compounds used are in equivalent amount and are not<br>
recoverable which unnecessarily produce large waste effluent and effect the process<br>
cost<br>
4	Phosgene or isocynate used are highly hazardous and difficult to handle   This<br>
necessitates especially in a commercial scale in a highly safety oriented expenditure<br>
which has a negative influence on the economic viability of such process<br>
5	The use of anhydride produces unnecessary waste of one mole of acid, which is not<br>
recoverable, and it goes as effluent discharge<br>
6.   The above mentioned processes have the drawback of using bases, hazardous chemicals like phosgene, isocynates and metal salts of organic compounds. In order to achieve the<br>
highest possible degree of conversion,  these  methods  need  high pressure,  high temperature and longer reaction time.<br>
The main objective of the present invention is to provide a process for the preparation of carbamates useful in agrochemicals, Pharmaceuticals and in peptide synthesis<br>
Another object of the invention is to develop a process with out the use of triethyi amine and other hazardous chemicals<br>
Yet another object of the invention is to produce such compounds using readily available haloformates and amines in the presence of transition metal powder which is recoverable reused again and also avoid the use of hazardous chemicals or bases like tnethylarnine and sodium hydride or anhydride or any high pressure for the reaction A feature of the invention is that the reaction is earned out in the presence of transition metals The conversions are quantitative within few minutes at room temperature.<br>
Ail the above mentioned unfavorable phenomena connected with the use of triethyi amine, phosgene, isocynate, and anhydride are thereby avoided<br>
Still another object of the invention is to recycle and reuse the condenspg agent (here metal powder) which would minimize the quantity of waste effluent in large scale Further object of the invention is broaden to the ammo acid carbamate and carbohydrate carbamates where the present process allows the stability of other protecting groups like esters, acetonides and silyl in the same conditions The process permits the quantitative production of the end products<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides an improved process for the preparation of carbamates of formula 1 wherein R=aryl, heterocyclic alkyl, poly nuclear arene, juranase pyranose/ amino acid or protected ammo acid R1 is methyl, ethyl, isobutyl or benzyl useful for agrochemicals, Pharmaceuticals and peptide synthesis which comprises reacting a halo formate with an amino substrate selected from straight chain/branched (C3-C15), aromatic, heterocyclic or protected amino acid (mono &amp; di acid) or hydroxyl protected carbohydrates in presence of a condensing agent selected from transition metal in a ratio ranging from 0.3 to 1 7 mol% by wt. in an organic solvent at a temperature m the range of 25 to 80°C. for a period in the range of 8-360 minutes, recovering the carbamates by conventional methods.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention the halo formates used are benzyl, atkyl, phenyl. isobutyl haloformates.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention the amme used may be such as straight chain or branched (C3-C15), aromatic or hetrocyclic, protected amino acids, or hydroxyi protected carbohydrates<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention the transition metals used are Cu. Cd. Zn. Fe and mixtures thereof ,<br>
Still another embodiment of the present invention the condensing agent used may be in the range ofO.3-1.7-mol.<br>
The present inventor found that it is considerably advantageous to use readily available haloformates. as phosgene equivalent and transition metals such as Cu. Cd. Zn. Fe as condensing agents. Suitable transition metals are either M+2 or M+3 or normally a mixture of two to achieve the maximum condensation of amines with haloformates. A mixture of metal powder like copper: zinc 0:1); cadmium: iron (1:1), iron:zmc (1.1); zinc: cadmium (1'1); coppencadmium (1:1) also can be used with good results. The condensing agent comes in quantities of 0,3 moles to 1.7 moles % based on the reactants for application purpose. The present invention for the preparation of carbamates using amines and haloformates. and metal powder as a condensing agent has the following advantages against the hitherto known processes.<br>
The reaction partners can influence each other in different ways. Thus, the haloformates and metal powder can be used together and the amme can be added later or the haloformates are added to the<br>
