TITLE OF THE INVENTION<br>
Dispersion of taste masked crystals or granules of active substances, chewable soft capsules filled with said dispersion and process for preparing same<br>
APPLICANTS<br>
Name : R P SCHERER TECHNOLOGIES, INC<br>
Nationality : a Nevada Corporation<br>
Address : Suite 100, 7690 Cheyenne Avenue, Las Vegas, NV 89129, USA<br>
PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of this invention and the manner in which it is to be performed :<br>
11-12-2007<br>
11  DEC 2007<br><br><br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
This invention relates to a new dosage form that provides a fast dissolving soft capsule that contains a liquid fill that comprises a dispersion of taste masked crystals or granules of a bad tasting active ingredient. In particular, said dosage form is a dispersion of crystals or granules of active substances in a lipophilic vehicle, said crystals or granules being coated by a coating for taste masking purposes. The invention relates also to chewable soft capsules that are fast dissolving in the mouth and contain said dispersion and to a process for preparing the novel dosage form.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The oral administration of medicines, and in particular medicines that have an unpleasant taste, is very difficult in some categories of patients, in particular infants, children, and patients who have difficulty in swallowing. Such difficulties lead to poor treatment compliance. Various dosage forms have been developed to overcome the problem of bad taste in oral formulations.<br>
Examples of approaches considered to overcome this problem include coating of crystals or granules of active substance, complexing (inclusion complexes) of the active substance in cyclodextrine type molecules as described in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,019,563 and 5,024,997, addition of agents that cause a slight localized effervescence as described in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,180,590 and 5,262,179, addition of a very large quantity of flavorings and maintenance of a certain pH environment as described in U.S. Patent No. 4,975,465, modification of the crystalline form of the active substance as described in U.S. Patent No. 5,466,865, use of a mixture of ibuprofen and its aluminum salt as described in U.S. Patent No. 4,831,058, and encapsulation of the active substance as described in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,814,332 and 5,653,993.<br>
More specifically, for oral formulations intended for children, numerous suspension dosage forms exist. These require the development of special coated particles whose coating for taste masking purposes must, on the one hand, resist the<br><br><br>
aqueous media during storage and, on the other, be able to disintegrate very quickly once swallowed to obtain a satisfactory bioavailability in vivo of the active substance.<br>
Development of useful coatings is difficult, as it requires the use of large amounts of expensive polymers, coating agents and mainly pH-depending polymers. As coating levels are high, drug content is limited as particle size is a factor, which must be addressed for an acceptable mouthfeel. Furthermore, the prior art preparations have problems of stability, and loss of taste masking can occur after long periods of storage.<br>
Fast-dissolving tablets are also available. The fast dissolving tablets can be manufactured through a process requiring the lyophilization of an aqueous solution, as described in GB Patent No. 1548022. The production of such tablets involves delicate preparation of the taste masking coating, which must be resistant to the aqueous medium used in the production of the dosage form and breakdown rapidly once swallowed so that the active substance becomes available.<br>
Tablets that disintegrate quickly in the mouth with or without a chewing action have also been proposed. See for example International Application Nos. WO 99/04763 and WO 00/51568. However, the production of such solid tablets also involves delicate preparation of the coating for taste masking purposes. Here the coating must be resistant to the pressure applied by chewing and breakdown rapidly once swallowed. In some cases, these coating materials for solid tablets must be elastic and thick in order to survive a compression operation (to form the tablet) and must also dissolve rapidly after swallowing. Furthermore, these tablets have a tendency to leave a doughy, granular or so-called sandy feeling in the mouth, which can be unpleasant. This is due to the particle size distribution of the coated crystals and/or granulates and to the absence of a liquid vehicle, except for saliva.<br>
Furthermore, soft capsules containing an active substance with an unpleasant taste, in particular ibuprofen, have been described in International Application Nos. WO 88/02625, WO 93/11753, WO 94/14423 and WO 02/17855. In these capsules, the active substance is placed in solution in a hydrophilic vehicle. With the solubilization of the active substance having already been achieved, in vivo release<br><br>
is predicted to be faster. However, these capsules are intended to be swallowed and often require the use of a glass of water for people having difficulties in swallowing. These dosage forms cannot be chewed since the fill formulation combines components, which can present a very unpleasant taste, and in some cases a burning sensation. Fill components, such as polyethylene glycol and ibuprofen, present strong bitterness and a burning effect in the mouth.<br>
There is a real need for pharmaceutical dosage forms for oral administration that are easy for all types of patients to take which are suitable for active substances with an unpleasant taste. The dosage form according to the present invention does not leave a doughy or granular feeling in the mouth. The present invention also provides dosage forms that are stable throughout a storage period, that allows a large quantity of active substance to be taken in a single administration and which provides for satisfactory release in vivo of the active substance.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present inventors have surprisingly and unexpectedly found that an improved oral dosage form that comprises in a preferred embodiment a chewable soft capsule that rapidly dissolves in the mouth that is filled with a dispersion consisting of taste masked active and lipophilic liquid. In an alternative embodiment, the invention relates to a dispersion of crystals or granules of active substance in a lipophilic vehicle, the said crystals or granules being coated by a coating for taste masking purposes. Said dispersion can be filled in any type of containers, for example, conventional soft capsules, chewable soft or fast dissolving soft gelatin capsules, ampoules, sachets, stick-packs and the like. According to another embodiment of the present invention, said dispersion can be encapsulated into fast dispersible chewable soft capsules comprising a chewable outer envelope.<br>
In the present invention, the term "coating for taste masking purposes" means any coating that prevents a quantity of the active substance that is detectable by the taste buds from coming into contact with said taste buds in the buccal cavity when the capsule is ruptured.<br>
In the dispersion according to the invention, the granules or crystals coated<br><br>
with at least one taste-masking agent are in suspension in a lipophilic vehicle.<br>
The present invention offers advantages over previous systems as lower stress is applied to the coated particles of active ingredient. Further, the coating does not need to resist an aqueous fill, as it will not be suspended in an aqueous based medium. Further, in the dosage form according to the present invention, the coating does not need to withstand a compression operation that is used to prepare tablets. Further, the lipophilic fill provides an "over-coating" of the taste masked active. Thus, when the lipophilic fill is released from the capsule (or any other unit dose envisaged) in the mouth, a thin lipophilic layer surrounds the coated particles of active and provides additional isolation of the taste buds.<br>
Taste perception is mainly linked to the amount of drug substance in solution or free in the lipophilic vehicle. One benefit of the present invention resides in the use of hydrophilic and/or lipophilic coatings, which are easy to apply and are used at lower coating levels, i.e. a lower weight ratio of coating/active substance, than conventionally used.<br>
Furthermore, the present invention is particularly suited for highly water soluble drug substances, which present a lower solubility in most lipidic vehicles. These drugs are also difficult to taste-mask using standard dosage forms due to the fact they will quickly dissolve in saliva and reach the taste buds. In contrast, these drugs can be used without difficulty and provide very satisfactory results in the dispersions according to the invention.<br>
One aspect of the invention resides in the selection of the lipophilic vehicle for the dispersion of the coated active ingredient. The lipophilic vehicle is chosen in order to have a limited solubilization power for the active and/or for at least one of the components of the taste mask coating.<br>
It should be noted that an acceptable degree of solubilization of the drug or active substance is a function of drug loading and taste of the active. Taste can be quantified by determination of the taste perception limit of the drug in a liquid vehicle.   In the case of an active with a very unpleasant taste, like ibuprofen for<br><br>
example, the lipophilic vehicle will be selected so as not to solubilize or minimize the solubilization of the ibuprofen and the coating components. On the other hand, in the case of an active with a less unpleasant taste, a certain degree of solubilization of the active and/or of the coating may be acceptable.<br>
In other words, the concentration of free active substance in the lipophilic vehicle should be, at most, about 1.5 times the active substance concentration for which a taste is detected in water, and preferably, at most, about 1.0 times and even more preferably, at most, about 0.5 times. For example, if the drug of interest can be detected at 1.0 mg/ml in water, no more than 1.5 mg/ml should be the solubility of the free active substance in the lipophilic vehicle.<br>
The dispersion according to the invention is very stable during storage, i.e. the organoleptic properties of the dispersion are maintained during at least 3 months, preferably at least 1 year and even more preferably during at least 2 years.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>

This list includes corresponding salts such as amino acids, metal salts and the like. These active salts should be selected regarding their compatibility with the coating/taste masking polymers, the taste in the lipophilic fill and their bioavailability linked to rapid dissolution in the stomach.<br>
The concentration of active substance in the dispersion depends on the container in which said dispersion is intended to be encapsulated. It will be apparent<br><br>
to a person skilled in the art that said concentration will be lower in stick-packs or in sachets than in capsules.<br>
The concentration of the active in a soft capsule is at most 75%, preferably between 5 and 50%, and even more preferably between 15 and 40% by weight.<br>
The active substance may be granulated prior to being coated, particularly in the case where the crystals of the active material are too small to be directly coated or to give the active substance improved solubilization and disintegration properties once the taste masking coating is removed. Granulation is performed by any suitable process well known to a person skilled in the art.<br>
According to a particular embodiment, the active substance may be granulated on a neutral core with the help of a solution or dispersion containing solubilization agents, granulation agents, binders and possibly sweeteners, flavorings and colorants.<br>
If it is desired to increase the dissolution in vivo of the active substance, it is also possible to introduce into the granules additional excipients selected from the group comprising effervescent agents, super disintegrants, lipophilic surfactants, hydrophilic surfactants, hydrosoluble agents promoting dispersion, and mixtures thereof.<br>
As the invention is particularly suitable for the formulation of active substances that have a bad taste, the crystals or granules of active substances are provided with a coating for taste masking purposes. This coating being preferentially hydrophilic based in order to achieve the faster in-vivo release.<br>
Useful coatings are described in the following references: International Application No. WO 01/03672, and U.S. Patent Nos. 5,320,855 and 5,552,152.<br>
In preferred embodiments, the coatings consist of a mixture of: ethyl cellulose and hydroxypropylmethylcellulose as described in International Application No. WO 01/03672, or a mixture of hydroxyethylcellulose and hydroxypropylmethylcellulose as described in U.S.  Patent No.  5,320,855.     Other useful coatings include a<br><br>
methacrylic copolymer with sufficient elasticity as described in U.S. Patent No. 5,552,152, waxes, lipidic and lipophilic compounds, glyceric macrogols, in particular when these are applied by the so-called "hot-melt coating" process which is a hot spraying of a lipophilic or lipidic based material using fluidized air bed equipment onto a fluidized substrate. See U.S. Patent No. 6,194,005 for further details. Representative materials include glycerol and/or polyethylene glycol behenate (Compricoat®, Compritol®888 ATO, HD5 ATO), glycerol palmitostearate (Precirol®ATO 5), glycerol stearate (Precirol®WL2155 ATO) cetyl palmitate (Precifac®ATO), Macrogol®, beeswaxes, gelucires such as glycerol and PEG-32 laurate, glycerol and PEG-32 palmitostearate, glycerol and PEG-32 stearate.<br>
The coating may also contain further additives selected from the group comprising colorants, sweeteners, flavorings, lipophilic surfactants, hydrophilic surfactants, hydrosoluble agents promoting in vivo dispersion, and mixtures thereof.<br>
The coating can be performed by any method known to a person skilled in the art, in particular by coacervation or spraying such as fluidized air bed coating as described in particular in International Application No. WO 01/03672 and U.S. Patent No. 5,552,152, rotogranulation, as described in particular in U.S. Patent No. 5,320,855, and by hot spraying of lipidic or lipophilic compounds, that is to say by the so-called hot-melt coating process as described in U.S. Patent No. 6,194,005.<br>
The coating for taste masking purposes can also be adapted to modify the in vivo dissolution profile of the active ingredient.<br>
This taste masking coating represents between 2 and 70%, preferably between 5 and 50%, and more preferably between 5 and 30% by weight of the total weight of the coated crystals or granules.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, the coated crystals or granules of active substance have an average particle size of less than 300 urn, preferably between 5 and 180 um, and more preferably between 50 and 150 um.<br>
Average particle size of the coated crystal and/or granules should be below<br><br>
300 um in order to provide good palatability and mouthfeel. Moreover, particle size distribution has an effect on container seal formation, in particular capsule seal formation. Encapsulation of larger particles can create untight seals during routine manufacturing operations.<br>
As it will be obvious for the person skilled in the art, any additive added in the lipophilic vehicle must be added in proportions that will not affect coating integrity and not increase drug substance solubility in the final dispersion.<br>
The effervescent agents that can be included in the granules or also the lipophilic vehicle, allow an increase in the dissolution of the active substance in vivo, in particular by localized modification of the pH, and by swelling of the particles. However, when the dispersion is intended to be filled into soft capsules, the use of effervescent agents in the lipophilic vehicle must be avoided.<br>
Such effervescent agents are agents that are capable of releasing a gas, and these are, in particular, acid-base pairings. The acid is selected from the group comprising, in particular, tartaric acid, citric acid, maleic acid, fumaric acid, malic acid, adipic acid, succinic acid, lactic acid, glycolic acid, alpha hydroxy acids, ascorbic acid and amino acids, as well as their salts and derivatives, and mixtures thereof. The alkaline agent is selected from the group comprising carbonate of potassium, lithium, sodium, calcium, or ammonium, or carbonate of L-lysine, carbonate of arginine, carbonate of sodic glycone, sodic carbonates of amino acids, anhydrous sodium perborate, effervescent perborate, sodic perborate monohydrate, percarbonate of sodium, sodium dichloroisocyanide, calcium hypochlorite, and mixtures thereof.<br>
The respective quantities of acid agent and alkaline agent are adjusted so that the reaction between the alkaline agent and the protons released by the acid allow the generation of a sufficient quantity of gas to obtain a satisfactory effervescence.<br>
The super-disintegrants included in the granules, and/or the coatings are selected from the group comprising cross-linked sodium carboxymethylcellulose referred to in the trade as croscarmellose, crospovidone, and mixtures thereof.<br><br>
Thickeners and/or dispersant agents may be placed in the lipophilic vehicle to reduce any sedimentation of the coated particles. Representative agents include gums such as guar gum, xanthans, short chain oligomers, partially hydrogenated vegetable oils, hard fats, waxes such as beeswax, carnauba, and ampiphilic compounds such as soya lecithin in particular, colloidal silica, and mixtures thereof.<br>
Lipophilic surfactants and the hydrophilic surfactants may be present in the granules, the coating and/or the lipophilic vehicle to facilitate the rupture of the taste masking coating. Representative surfactants are described in International Application No. WO 95/00561. Other surfactants include sucroesters that are esters of saccharose fatty acids, chosen from the group comprising saccharose distearates, saccharose mono-distearates, saccharose monopalmitate and mixtures thereof.<br>
The dispersion of the active substance in vivo can also be improved by the addition of hydrosoluble agents to the granules, the coating and/or the vehicle. These agents are salts or buffers selected from the group comprising sodium chloride, potassium hydroxide, potassium citrate, potassium sorbate, sodium mono- or diphosphate, and mixtures thereof.<br>
The colorants, flavorings and sweeteners that can be included in the lipophilic vehicles, granules or coatings according to the invention are those of conventional use in the food or pharmaceutical industry. These additives are added in sufficient quantities to give the desired taste and appearance properties and can easily be adapted by a professional.<br>
Examples of colorants include azorubin, FCF brilliant blue, patent blue V, erythrosine, brown, yellow, black, red 4, yellow orange S iron oxides, quinoline yellow, FDC red, DC red 33, cochineal red A, timiron, titanium dioxide, FD8C red 40, FD8C green 3, curcumine, lactoflavin (riboflavin), tartrazine, amaranthine, indigotine (indigo carmine), chlorophyls, copper complexes of chlorophyls and chlorophyllins, brilliant acid green BS, caramel, brilliant black BN, carbo medicinalis vegetalis, carotenoids (alpha-, beta-, gamma-carotene, bixin, norbixin, capsanthin, capsorubine, lycopene, beta-apo-8'carotenal, ethyl ester of beta-apo-8' carotenoic acid), xanthophylls, (fiavoxanthin, lutein, cryptoxanthin, rubixanthin, violoxanthin,<br><br>

According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, the dispersion comprises, as lipophilic vehicle, dimethicone in which there is dispersed coated granules of active substance, preferably ibuprofen, said coating comprising a mixture of ethylcellulose and hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, said coating representing 5% to 30% of the total weight of the granules, with the active substance representing between 5 and 50% by weight of the total weight of the dispersion, with at least one additive being dispersed in the dimethicone, said additive should not substantially affect the taste-masking effect of the coating and preferentially should improve the taste masking efficiency, and is selected from the group comprising colorants, flavorings and sweeteners.<br>
The dispersion according to the invention can be presented as a syrup or, preferably, is intended to be filled in any type of containers, in particular in conventional, chewable or soft-gel type capsules, ampoules, sachets and stick-packs.<br>
The present invention also concerns "chewable capsules" and fast dissolving capsules filled with the dispersion described above. The term "fast dissolving capsule" means a capsule, which disintegrates in the mouth without chewing in less than 30 seconds, i.e. the dispersion fill is released in the mouth in less than 30 seconds. The gelatin shell constituting the envelope of said capsule may disperse in the mouth in less than 120 seconds.<br><br>
The term "chewable capsule" means a soft capsule that ruptures under the pressure exerted by the jaws or the tongue when it is placed in the buccal cavity. The residue obtained when the capsule ruptures disperse quickly in the mouth. Chewable soft capsules that are completely suitable for the formulations according to the invention are those described, for example, in International Application No. WO 95/00123.<br>
One important aspect of the present invention resides in the fact that the inventive dispersions and soft capsules filled with those dispersions have excellent physical stability for at least 3 months, preferably for at least 1 year, and even more preferably for at least 2 years.<br>
According to a particular embodiment of the chewable soft capsule according to the invention, the outer envelope of the chewable soft capsule comprises gelatin and a plasticizer, and at least a starch or amylum acetate compatible with the gelatin, with the gelatin forming a primary matrix for the plasticizer and the starch or amylum acetate forming a secondary matrix for the plasticizer.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment, the outer envelope or capsule wall comprises between 18 and 30% gelatin, between 30 and 45% by weight of plasticizer, between 3 and 12% of starch or amylum acetate and up to 12%, preferably between 6 and 10%, of an unbleached starch and water to 100%, with these percentages being percentages by weight in relation to the total weight of the wall composition.<br>
The unbleached starch acetate is preferably of potato origin. The gelatin could be of bovine, porcine, fish, poultry origin. The plasticizer is chosen from the group comprising polyols, in particular glycerol, xylitol, sorbitol, polyglycerol, non-crystallisable solutions of sorbitol, glucose, fructose and glucose syrups, and mixtures thereof. An advantageous plasticizer is a mixture of sorbitol, sorbitans, maltitol and mannitol sold under the brand name ANIDRISORB® by Roquette.<br>
The preferred plasticizer is glycerol and represents at least 30% by weight, preferably between 30 and 70% by weight, of the composition of the outer envelope (dry film).<br><br>
The "crunchable" or "chewable" nature of the capsule can be modified by adding to the composition of the envelope an oil such as distilled coconut oil. The quantity of oil present in the envelope may be up to 15%, preferably not more than 10% and more preferably between 3 and 7%, typically 5%, by weight of the weight of the composition of the envelope preparation.<br>
The outer envelope of the soft capsule according to the invention can also comprise sweeteners and flavorings, thereby giving the chewable soft capsule a more pleasant taste. It may also contain colorants in order to give said capsule a pleasant and attractive appearance.<br>
The sweeteners, flavorings and colorants are those, which are described above in relation with the dispersion composition.<br>
According to a particularly advantageous embodiment of the invention, the chewable soft capsule comprises:<br>
an envelope with said envelope encapsulating a dispersion in dimethicone of active substance granules coated with a mixture of ethyl cellulose and hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, with the active substance representing between 5 and 50% by weight of the total weight of the dispersion, with at least one additive being dispersed in the dimethicone, said additive should not substantially affect the taste-masking effect of said mixture and is selected from the group consisting of colorants, flavorings and sweeteners.<br>
The present invention is also concerned with the process for preparation of chewable soft capsules. This process comprises the steps of:<br>
a)	preparing a film for a capsule,<br>
b)	as necessary, preparation of granules of active substance;<br>
c)	coating crystals of active substance or granules prepared above using a coating for taste masking purposes;<br>
d)	as necessary, dispersing additives in a lipophilic vehicle, and milling of this;<br>
e)	dispersing coated crystals or granules in the lipophilic vehicle to form a dispersion;<br><br>
f)	filling of the capsules with said dispersion by the means of any known<br>
technique;<br>
g)	sealing of the capsules by the means of any known technique; and<br>
h) drying of the capsules.<br>
The step for preparation of the film for the capsule or outer envelope is performed according to the process described in International Application No. WO 95/00123. The granulation can be carried out by any of the conventional granulation processes, in particular dry granulation and wet granulation. Coating can be carried out by conventional means and preferably by fluidized air bed coating.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment, the process comprises steps of:<br>
a)	preparing a film for a capsule;<br>
b)	coating of crystals of active substance, preferably ibuprofen, by spraying of a mixture of ethyl cellulose and hydroxypropylmethylcellulose dissolved in an organic solvent system;<br>
c)	dispersing colorants, sweeteners and flavorings in a lipophilic vehicle, and optionally milling of this;<br>
d)	dispersing the coated crystals or granules in the lipophilic vehicle with additives added;<br>
e)	filling the capsules with said dispersion by the means of any known technique;<br>
f)	sealing the capsules by the means of any known technique;<br>
The invention is now described in a detailed manner using the following examples, which are intended solely to illustrate the invention and are not restrictive.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
Example 1: Lipophilic Vehicles<br>
In this example, lipophilic vehicles with different solubilizing powers for ibuprofen were investigated.<br>
The solubility of ibuprofen at 25°C was measured using an HPLC method in the following lipophilic vehicles:<br><br>
1)	Medium chain triglycerides sold by SASOL under the brand name Mygliol 812N. The solubility was 65mg/ml.<br>
2)	Soya oil. The solubility was 44mg/ml.<br>
3)	Dimethicone 100 silicone oil from Rhodia. The solubility was 1 mg/ml. Using a taste panel of two (2) persons, it was determined that, in aqueous<br>
buffer and lipophilic dispersions, the bitter taste of ibuprofen was detected at concentrations above 10 mg/ml. This taste limit was also confirmed in other lipophilic vehicles as well. Using the teachings of the present invention, dimethicone would be an acceptable vehicle. This was cross-checked by the following study. Three formulations were prepared using ibuprofen coated particles prepared by coating on a fluidized air bed.<br>
Formulation 1: 80% by weight ibuprofen; and 20% by weight glycerol palmitostearate sold under the brand name PRECIROL® ATO 5. The process used to obtain such particles is set forth in U.S. Patent No. 6,194,005. These coated particles were dispersed in the following four (4) lipophilic vehicles at a concentration of 25 wt. %:<br>
1)	Mygliol 812N. (formulation 1-1)<br>
2)	Soya oil. (formulation 1-2)<br>
3)	Dimethicone 100 cps (formulation 1-3)<br>
4)	Dimethicone 500 cps (formulation 1-4)<br>
Formulation 2: Ibuprofen coated particles with the following formula were prepared by coacervation according to U.S. Patent No. 5,814,332. 83.4% by weight ibuprofen and 16.6% by weight of a mix of cellulose acetate phathalate, acid gelatin and additives including glutaraldehyde and sodium lauryl sulfate. These coated particles were dispersed in the following 4 lipophilic vehicles at a concentration of 25 wt. %:<br>
1)	Mygliol® 812N. (formulation 2-1)<br>
2)	Soya oil. (formulation 2-2)<br>
3)	Dimethicone 100 cps (formulation 2-3)<br>
4)	Dimethicone 500 cps (formulation 2-4)<br>
Formulation 3: Ibuprofen coated particles with the following formula were prepared by coating on a fluidized air bed: 80.0% by weight ibuprofen; 13.3% by<br><br>
weight of ethyl cellulose; and 6.7% by weight of hydroxypropylmethylcellulose. For this formulation, the ibuprofen had a particle size of 70 urn. For the fluidized bed preparation of the coated particles, all of the coating components were dissolved in a hydroalcoholic solution and then sprayed on the ibuprofen in a Wurster coating machine at a spray rate of 75-200 gm/minute at an inlet temperature of 4-16°C and used 200-600 cfm of process air. These coated particles were dispersed in the following four (4) lipophilic vehicles at a concentration of 25 wt. %:<br>
1)	Mygliol® 812N (formulation 3-1)<br>
2)	Soya oil (formulation 3-2)<br>
3)	Dimethicone 100 cps (formulation 3-3)<br>
4)	Dimethicone 500 cps (formulation 3-4)<br>
For each of these formulations, the taste masking and the appearance of the coated crystals were assessed over time (lh, 3h, 24h, 10 days, 14 days and 2 months after preparation). The formulations were tested for taste masking by two people. The taste masking is characterized by the following scale:<br>
1	:    good taste, no burning effect in the throat from the ibuprofen;<br>
2	:   slight burning effect noticeable, still acceptable;<br>
3	:   very pronounced and unacceptable burning effect;<br>
4	:   intolerable burning effect.<br>
The   appearance   of the   coated   crystals  was   assessed  by  microscopic observation under a lens (x 10).   The appearance of the coated crystals and of the coating was assessed by using the following scale: A    :   particles intact;<br>
B    :   slight swelling of the coating and appearance of a few loose crystals; C     :   majority of crystals uncoated; D    :   only uncoated crystals present.<br><br><br>
The results obtained for each of the formulations are given in Table 1 below. TABLE 1<br><br>
These examples show that dimethicone in which the ibuprofen is insoluble is the correct lipophilic vehicle. At 3 months time, the dimethicone formulations still exhibited excellent stability.<br><br>
Example 2: Coated Particles<br>
Coated particles of ibuprofen were prepared by spraying a hydroalkanolic solution of ethyl cellulose and hydroxypropylmethylcellulose on 70 micron particles of ibuprofen in a air fluidized bed. The obtained coated particles present in the following composition were obtained using the conditions previously described.<br><br>
Formula (66711)	Composition (% by wt)<br>
Component	<br><br>
Ibuprofen	87.0<br>
Ethyl Cellulose	8.7<br>
Hydroxypropylmethylcellulose	4.3<br>
Characterization:<br>
The size of the coated particles was measured by laser granulometry on a Mastersizer 2000 (Malvern) apparatus using mineral oil as dispersing medium. 10% by volume had a particle size of 76 um or less (D 10=76 um), while 50% volume had a diameter of 152 um or less (D50=152 um) and 90% by volume of the particles had a size of 281 um or less (D90=280 um).<br><br>
The stability of the different coated particles was measured in the different lipophilic vehicles used in Example 1.   In order to give further evidence of the lipophilic vehicle selection, coated particles from above were dispersed in Mygliol 812N and silicon oil for 18 hours. The particle size was determined on each sample using a Mastersizer 2000. Results from this study are set forth in Table 2.<br><br><br>
The data demonstrate that coated particle integrity is best preserved using silicon oil.<br>
Coated particles stability:<br>
The coated particles produced above were bulk packed in glass containers and were placed in stability enclosures, at controlled temperature and humidity: 40°C/75% RH.<br>
The properties of coated particles were observed at production and after storing 1 and 3 months. TABLE 3<br><br>
TABLE 4<br>
Dissolution profile of coated particles, fill formulations and capsules was monitored by applying the following dissolution test. An apparatus type III according to the USP was used (VANKEL BIODISS). Dissolution vessels were filled with 900 ml of pH 6.0 R2 buffer according the European Pharmacopea. Dissolution media heat is controlled at 37°C +/- 0.5°C during the whole test. A dip rate of 30 dips / minute was applied in order to mimic jaw strain onto the capsule. Samples of 10 ml each were<br><br><br>
collected at predetermined time points and the concentration of ibuprofen dissolved was measured using an HPLC / UV method.<br><br>

Example 4:<br>
In this example, lipophilic vehicles with different solubilizing powers for dextromethorphan HBr were tested. The solubility of dextromethorphan HBr at 25°C was measured using an HPLC method in the following lipophilic vehicles:<br>
1)	Medium chain triglycerides sold by SASOL under the brand name Mygliol® 812N provided a solubility of 120 ug/ml.<br>
2)	Soya oil provided a solubility of approx. 6 ug/ml;<br>
3)	Paraffin oil provided a solubility of approx. 1 ug/ml;<br>
4)	Dimethicone 100 silicone oil from RHODIA provided a solubility of less than 1 ug/ml.<br>
Using a taste panel of 2 persons, it was determined that in aqueous buffer and lipophilic dispersions, dextromethorphan HBr taste is detected at concentrations<br><br>
around 0.1 mg/ml. Therefore, dimethicone, paraffin oil and soy oil should be the vehicles acceptable for such formulations. This was cross-checked by the following study.<br>
The following formulations were prepared: Formulation 1:<br>
Dextromethorphan HBr HBr coated particles with the following formula were prepared by coating using a fluidized air bed equipment as set forth above.<br>
1)	76.9% by weight of dextromethorphan HBr;<br>
2)	15.4% by weight of ethyl cellulose;<br>
3)	7.7% by weight of hydroxypropylmethylcellulose.<br>
These coated particles were dispersed at 25% weight/weight in the following 4 lipophilic vehicles:<br>
1)	Mygliol 812N (formulation 1 -1)<br>
2)	Soya oil (formulation 1-2)<br>
3)	Paraffin oil (formulation 1-3)<br>
4)	Dimethicone 100 (formulation 1-4)<br>
1<br>
2 3 4<br>
For each of these formulations, the taste masking and the appearance of the coated crystals were assessed over time (1 day and 3 days after preparation). The formulations were tested for taste masking by two people. The taste masking was characterized using the following scale:<br>
good taste;<br>
taste noticeable, still acceptable;<br>
very pronounced and unacceptable taste;<br>
intolerable taste.<br>
The appearance of the coated crystals was assessed by microscopic observation under a lens (x 10). The appearance of the coated crystals and of the coating was assessed by using the following scale:<br>
1	:	crystals intact;<br>
2	:	slight swelling of the coating and appearance of a few loose<br>
crystals;<br>
3	:	majority of crystals uncoated;<br><br>
4    :	only uncoated crystals present<br>
The results obtained for each of the formulations are given in Table 14. TABLE 14<br><br>
This experiment indicates that dimethicone (in which the dextromethorphan HBr is insoluble) is the best lipophilic vehicle. As back-up vehicles, paraffin oil and soya oil also provide acceptable results.<br>
Example 5: Coated Particles<br>
Coated particles of dextromethorphan HBr were prepared by spraying an organic solution (90% by wt. acetone, 10% by wt. water) of ethyl cellulose and hydroxypropylmethylcellulose on particles of dextromethorphan HBr in a fluidized air bed equipment. The obtained coated particles consisted of the formula set forth in Table 15. TABLE 15<br><br>
Coated particles	<br>
Component	Composition (%bt wt)<br>
Dextromethorphan HBr	76.9<br>
Ethyl Cellulose	15.4<br>
Hydroxypropylmethylcellulose	7.7<br><br><br>
One skilled in this art will appreciate that obtaining levels of active above 70% by wt. is unusual, especially if the coating is an effective taste masker.<br>
Characterization:<br>
The size of the coated particles was measured by laser granulometry on a Mastersizer 2000 (Malvern) apparatus using mineral oil as the dispersing medium.<br>
