Description<br>
The present invention relates to audio coder and decoders<br>
and audio coding in general and, in particular, to audio<br>
codings allowing audio signals to be coded with a short<br>
delay time.<br>
The audio compression method best known at present is MPEG-<br>
1 Layer III. With this compression method, the sample or<br>
audio values of an audio signal are coded into a coded<br>
signal in a lossy manner. Put differently, irrelevance and<br>
redundancy of the original audio signal are reduced or<br>
ideally removed when compressing. In order to achieve this,<br>
simultaneous and temporal maskings are recognized by a<br>
psycho-acoustic model, i.e. a temporally varying masking<br>
threshold depending on the audio signal is calculated or<br>
determined indicating from which volume on tones of a<br>
certain frequency are perceivable for human hearing. This<br>
information in turn is used for coding the signal by<br>
quantizing the spectral values of the audio signal in a<br>
more precise or less precise manner or not at all,<br>
depending on the masking threshold, and integrating same<br>
into the coded signal.<br>
Audio compression methods, such as, for example, the MP3<br>
format, experience a limit in their applicability when<br>
audio data is to be transferred via a bit rate-limited<br>
transmission channel in a, on the one hand, compressed<br>
manner, but, on the other hand, with as small a delay time<br>
as possible. In some applications, the delay time does not<br>
play a role, such as, for example, when archiving audio<br>
information. Small delay audio coders, which are sometimes<br>
referred to as "ultra low delay coders", however, are<br>
necessary where time-critical audio signals are to be<br>
transmitted, such as, for example, in tele-conferencing, in<br>
wireless loudspeakers or microphones. For these fields of<br><br>
application, the article by Schuller G. et al. "Perceptual<br>
Audio Coding using Adaptive Pre- and Post-Filters and<br>
Lossless Compression", IEEE Transactions on Speech and<br>
Audio Processing, vol. 10, no. 6, September 2002, pp. 379 -<br>
390, suggests audio coding where the irrelevance reduction<br>
and the redundancy reduction are not performed based on a<br>
single transform, but on two separate transforms.<br>
The principle will be discussed subsequently referring to<br>
Figs. 12 and 13. Coding starts with an audio signal 902<br>
which has already been sampled and is thus already present<br>
as a sequence 904 of audio or sample values 906, wherein<br>
the temporal order of the audio values 906 is indicated by<br>
an arrow 908. A listening threshold is calculated by means<br>
of a psycho-acoustic model for successive blocks of audio<br>
values 906 characterized by an ascending numeration by<br>
"block#". Fig. 13, for example, shows a diagram where,<br>
relative to the frequency f, graph a plots the spectrum of<br>
a signal block of 128 audio values 906 and b plots the<br>
masking threshold, as has been calculated by a psycho-<br>
acoustic model, in logarithmic units. The masking threshold<br>
indicates, as has already been mentioned, up to which<br>
intensity frequencies remain inaudible for the human ear,<br>
namely all tones below the masking threshold b. Based on<br>
the listening thresholds calculated for each block, an<br>
irrelevance reduction is achieved by controlling a<br>
parameterizable filter, followed by a quantizer. For a<br>
parameterizable filter, a parameterization is calculated<br>
such that the frequency response thereof corresponds to the<br>
inverse of the magnitude of the masking threshold. This<br>
parameterization is indicated in Fig. 12 by x#(i).<br>
After filtering the audio values 906, quantization with a<br>
constant step size takes place, such as, for example, a<br>
rounding operation to the next integer. The quantizing<br>
noise caused by this is white noise. On the decoder side,<br>
the filtered signal is "retransformed" again by a<br>
parameterizable filter, the transfer function of which is<br><br>
set to the magnitude of the masking threshold itself. Not<br>
only is the filtered signal decoded again by this, but the<br>
quantizing noise on the decoder side is also adjusted to<br>
the form or shape of the masking threshold. In order for<br>
the quantizing noise to correspond to the masking threshold<br>
as precisely as possible, an amplification value a# applied<br>
to the filtered signal before quantizing is calculated on<br>
the coder side for each parameter set or each<br>
parameterization. In order for the retransform to be<br>
performed on the decoder side, the amplification value a<br>
and the parameterization x are transferred to the coder as<br>
side information 910 apart from the actual main data,<br>
namely the quantized filtered audio values 912. For the<br>
redundancy reduction 914, this data, i.e. the side<br>
information 910 and the main data 912, is subjected to a<br>
loss-free compression, namely entropy coding, which is how<br>
the coded signal is obtained.<br>
The above-mentioned article suggests a size of 128 sample<br>
values 906 as a block size. This allows a relatively short<br>
delay of 8 ms with a sampling rate of 32 kHz. With<br>
reference to the detailed implementation, the article also<br>
states that, for increasing the efficiency of the side<br>
information coding, the side information, namely the<br>
coefficients x# and a#, will only be transferred if there<br>
are sufficient changes compared to a parameter set<br>
transferred before, i.e. if the changes exceed a certain<br>
threshold value. In addition, it is described that the<br>
implementation is preferably performed such that a current<br>
parameter set is not directly applied to all the sample<br>
values belonging to the respective block, but that a linear<br>
interpolation of the filter coefficients x# is used to<br>
avoid audible artifacts. In order to perform the linear<br>
interpolation of the filter coefficients, a lattice<br>
structure is suggested for the filter to prevent<br>
instabilities from occurring. For the case that a coded<br>
signal with a controlled bit rate is desired, the article<br>
also suggests selectively multiplying or attenuating the<br><br>
filtered signal scaled with the time-depending<br>
amplification factor a by a factor unequal to 1 so that<br>
audible interferences occur, but the bit rate can be<br>
reduced at sites of the audio signal which are complicated<br>
to code.<br>
Although the audio coding scheme described in the article<br>
mentioned above already reduces the delay time for many<br>
applications to a sufficient degree, a problem in the above<br>
scheme is that, due to the requirement of having to<br>
transfer the masking threshold or transfer function of the<br>
coder-side filter, subsequently referred to as pre-filter,<br>
the transfer channel is loaded to a relatively high degree<br>
even though the filter coefficients will only be<br>
transferred when a predetermined threshold is exceeded.<br>
Another disadvantage of the above coding scheme is that,<br>
due to the fact that the masking threshold or inverse<br>
thereof has to be made available on the decoder side by the<br>
parameter set x# to be transferred, a compromise has to be<br>
made between the lowest possible bit rate or high<br>
compression ratio on the one hand and the most precise<br>
approximation possible or parameterization of the masking<br>
threshold or inverse thereof on the other hand. Thus, it is<br>
inevitable for the quantizing noise adjusted to the masking<br>
threshold by the above audio coding scheme to exceed the<br>
masking threshold in some frequency ranges and thus result<br>
in audible audio interferences for the listener. Fig. 13,<br>
for example, shows the parameterized frequency response of<br>
the decoder-side parameterizable filter by graph c. As can<br>
be seen, there are regions where the transfer function of<br>
the decoder-side filter, subsequently referred to as post-<br>
filter, exceeds the masking threshold b. The problem is<br>
aggravated by the fact that the parameterization is only<br>
transferred intermittently with a sufficient change between<br>
parameterizations and interpolated therebetween. An<br>
interpolation of the filter coefficients x#, as is<br>
suggested in the article, alone results in audible<br><br>
interferences when the amplification value a# is kept<br>
constant from node to node or from new parameterization to<br>
new parameterization. Even if the interpolation suggested<br>
in the article is also applied to the side information<br>
value a#, i.e. the amplification value transferred, audible<br>
audio artifacts may remain in the audio signal arriving on<br>
the decoder side.<br>
Another problem with the audio coding scheme according to<br>
Figs. 12 and 13 is that the filtered signal may, due to the<br>
frequency-selective filtering, take a non-predictable form<br>
where, particularly due to a random superposition of many<br>
individual harmonic waves, one or several individual audio<br>
values of the coded signal add up to very high values which<br>
in turn result in a poorer compression ratio in the<br>
subsequent redundancy reduction due to their rare<br>
occurrence.<br>
It is the object of the present invention to provide a more<br>
effective audio coding scheme.<br>
This object is achieved by a method according to claims 8<br>
or 10 and a device according to claims 1 or 9.<br>
Inventive coding of an audio signal of a sequence of audio<br>
values into a coded signal includes determining a first<br>
listening threshold for a first block of audio values of<br>
the sequence of audio values and a second listening<br>
threshold for a second block of audio values of the<br>
sequence of audio values; calculating a version of a first<br>
parameterization of a parameterizable filter such that the<br>
transfer function thereof roughly corresponds to the<br>
inverse of the magnitude of the first listening threshold<br>
and a version of a second parameterization of the<br>
parameterizable filter such that the transfer function<br>
thereof roughly corresponds to the inverse of the magnitude<br>
of the second listening threshold; filtering a<br>
predetermined block of audio values of the sequence of<br><br>
audio values with the parameterizable filter using a<br>
predetermined parameterization which in a predetermined<br>
manner depends on the version of the second<br>
parameterization to obtain a block of filtered audio values<br>
corresponding to the predetermined block; quantizing the<br>
filtered audio values to obtain a block of quantized<br>
filtered audio values; forming a combination of the version<br>
of the first parameterization and the version of the second<br>
parameterization including at least a difference between<br>
the version of the first parameterization and the version<br>
of the second parameterization; and integrating information<br>
from which the quantized filtered audio values and a<br>
version of the first parameterization may be derived and<br>
which includes the combination into the coded signal.<br>
The central idea of the present invention is that a higher<br>
compression ratio may be achieved by transferring<br>
differences of successive parameterizations.<br>
If, additionally, the transfer of parameterizations only<br>
takes place when there is a sufficient difference between<br>
same, the finding of the present invention will in<br>
particular also be that in this case, too, although the<br>
parameterization differences do not fall below the minimum<br>
difference measure, nevertheless the transfer of<br>
differences between two parameterizations provides a<br>
compression increase, instead of parameterization, more<br>
than compensating for the additional complexity of<br>
calculating the difference on the coder side and<br>
calculating the sum on the decoder side.<br>
According to an embodiment of the present invention, the<br>
pure differences between successive parameterizations are<br>
transferred, whereas according to another embodiment the<br>
minimum threshold starting from which parameterizations of<br>
new nodes will be transferred is subtracted from these<br>
differences.<br><br>

Fig. 1 shows an audio coder according to an embodiment of<br>
the present invention. The audio coder, which is generally<br>
indicated by 10, includes a data input 12 where it receives<br>
the audio signal to be coded, which, as will be explained<br>
in greater detail later referring to Fig. 5a, consists of a<br><br>
sequence of audio values or sample values, and a data<br>
output where the coded signal is output, the information<br>
content of which will be discussed in greater detail<br>
referring to Fig. 5b.<br>
The audio coder 10 of Fig. 1 is divided into an irrelevance<br>
reduction part 16 and a redundancy reduction part 18. The<br>
irrelevance reduction part 16 includes means 20 for<br>
determining a listening threshold, means 22 for calculating<br>
an amplification value, means 24 for calculating a<br>
parameterization, node comparing means 26, a quantizer 28<br>
and a parameterizable pre-filter 30 and an input FIFO<br>
(first in first out) buffer 32, a buffer or memory 38 and a<br>
multiplier or multiplying means 40. The redundancy<br>
reduction part 18 includes a compressor 34 and a bit rate<br>
controller 36.<br>
The irrelevance reduction part 16 and the redundancy<br>
reduction part 18 are connected in series in this order<br>
between the data input 12 and the data output 14. In<br>
particular, the data input 12 is connected to a data input<br>
of the means 20 for determining a listening threshold and<br>
to a data input of the input buffer 32. A data output of<br>
the means 20 for determining a listening threshold is<br>
connected to an input of the means 24 for calculating a<br>
parameterization and to a data input of the means 22 for<br>
calculating an amplification value to pass on a listening<br>
threshold determined to same. The means 22 and 24 calculate<br>
a parameterization or amplification value based on the<br>
listening threshold and are connected to the node comparing<br>
means 26 to pass on these results to same. Depending on the<br>
result of the comparison, the node comparing means 26, as<br>
will be discussed subsequently, passes on the results<br>
calculated by the means 22 and 24 as input parameter or<br>
parameterization to the parameterizable pre-filter 30. The<br>
parameterizable pre-filter 30 is connected between a data<br>
output of the input buffer 32 and a data input of the<br>
buffer 38. The multiplier 40 is connected between a data<br><br>
output of the buffer 38 and the quantizer 28. The quantizer<br>
28 passes on filtered audio values which may be multiplied<br>
or scaled, but always quantized, to the redundancy<br>
reduction part 18, more precisely to a data input of the<br>
compressor 34. The node comparing means 26 passes on<br>
information from which the input parameters passed to the<br>
parameterizable pre-filter 30 may be derived to the<br>
redundancy reduction part 18, more precisely to another<br>
data input of the compressor 34. The bit rate controller is<br>
connected to a control input of the multiplier 40 via a<br>
control connection to provide for the quantized filtered<br>
audio values, as received from the pre-filter 30, to be<br>
multiplied by the multiplier 40 by a suitable multiplicand,<br>
as will be discussed in greater detail below. The bit rate<br>
controller 36 is connected between a data output of the<br>
compressor 34 and the data output 14 of the audio coder 10<br>
in order to determine the multiplicand for the multiplier<br>
40 in a suitable manner. When each audio value passes the<br>
quantizer 40 for the first time, the multiplicand is at<br>
first set to a suitable scaling factor, such as, for<br>
example, 1. The buffer 38, however, continues storing each<br>
filtered audio value to give the bit rate controller 36, as<br>
will be described subsequently, a possibility of changing<br>
the multiplicand for another pass of a block of audio<br>
values. If such a change is not indicated by the bit rate<br>
controller 36, the buffer 38 may release the memory taken<br>
up by this block.<br>
After the setup of the audio coder of Fig. 1 has been<br>
described above, the mode of functioning thereof will<br>
subsequently be described referring to Figs. 2 to 7b.<br>
As can be seen from Fig. 2, the audio signal, when having<br>
reached the audio input 12, has already been obtained by<br>
audio signal sampling 50 from an analog audio signal. The<br>
audio signal sampling is performed with a predetermined<br>
sampling frequency, which is usually between 32 and 48 kHz.<br>
Consequently, at the data input 12 there is an audio signal<br><br>
consisting of a sequence of sample or audio values.<br>
Although the coding of the audio signal does not take place<br>
in a block-based manner, as will become obvious from the<br>
subsequent description, the audio values at the data input<br>
12 are at first combined to form audio blocks in step 52.<br>
The combination to form audio blocks takes place only for<br>
the purpose of determining the listening threshold, as will<br>
become obvious from the following description, and takes<br>
place in an input stage of the means 20 for determining a<br>
listening threshold. In the present embodiment, it is<br>
exemplarily assumed that 128 successive audio values each<br>
are combined to form audio blocks and that the combination<br>
takes place such that, one the one hand, successive audio<br>
blocks do not overlap and, on the other hand, are direct<br>
neighbors of one another. This will exemplarily be<br>
discussed shortly referring to Fig. 5a.<br>
Fig. 5a at 54 indicates the sequence of sample values, each<br>
sample value being illustrated by a rectangle 56. The<br>
sample values are numbered for illustration purposes,<br>
wherein for reasons of clarity in turn only some sample<br>
values of the sequence 54 are shown. As is indicated by<br>
braces above the sequence 54, 128 successive sample values<br>
each are combined to form a block according to the present<br>
embodiment, wherein the directly successive 128 sample<br>
values form the next block. Only as a precautionary<br>
measure, it is to be pointed out that the combination to<br>
form blocks could also be performed differently,<br>
exemplarily by overlapping blocks or spaced-apart blocks<br>
and blocks having another block size, although the block<br>
size of 128 in turn is preferred since it provides a good<br>
tradeoff between high audio quality on the one hand and the<br>
smallest possible delay time on the other hand.<br>
Whereas the audio blocks combined in the means 20 in step<br>
52 are processed in the means 20 for determining a<br>
listening threshold block by block, the incoming audio<br>
values will be buffered 54 in the input buffer 32 until the<br><br>
parameterizable pre-filter 30 has obtained input parameters<br>
from the node comparing means 26 to perform pre-filtering,<br>
as will be described subsequently.<br>
As can be seen from Fig. 3, the means 20 for determining a<br>
listening threshold starts its processing directly after<br>
sufficient audio values have been received at the data<br>
input 12 to form an audio block or to form the next audio<br>
block, which the means 20 monitors by an inspection in step<br>
60. If there is no complete processable audio block, the<br>
means 20 will wait. If a complete audio block to be<br>
processed is present, the means 20 for determining a<br>
listening threshold will calculate a listening threshold in<br>
step 62 on the basis of a suitable psycho-acoustic model in<br>
step 62. For illustrating the listening threshold,<br>
reference is again made to Fig. 12 and, in particular, to<br>
graph b having been obtained on the basis of a psycho-<br>
acoustic model, exemplarily with regard to a current audio<br>
block with a spectrum a. The masking threshold which is<br>
determined in step 62 is a frequency-dependent function<br>
which may vary for successive audio blocks and may also<br>
vary considerably from audio signal to audio signal, such<br>
as, for example, from rock music to classical music pieces.<br>
The listening threshold indicates for each frequency a<br>
threshold value below which the human hearing cannot<br>
perceive interferences.<br>
In a subsequent step 64, the means 24 and the means 22<br>
calculate from the listening threshold M(f) calculated (f<br>
indicating the frequency) an amplification value a or<br>
parameter set of N parameters x(i) (i = 1, ..., N) . The<br>
parameterization x(i) which the means 24 calculates in step<br>
64 is provided for the parameterizable pre-filter 30 which<br>
is, for example, embodied in an adaptive filter structure,<br>
as is used in LPC coding (LPC = linear predictive coding).<br>
For example, s (n) , n = 0, ..., 127, be the 128 audio values<br>
of the current audio block and s' (n) be the resulting<br><br>
filtered 128 audio values, then the filter is exemplarily<br>
embodied such that the following equation applies:<br><br>
K being the filter order and atk, k = 1, ..., K, being the<br>
filter coefficients, and the index t is to illustrate that<br>
the filter coefficients change in successive audio blocks.<br>
The means 24 then calculates the parameterization atk such<br>
that the transfer function H(f) of the parameterizable pre-<br>
filter 30 roughly equals the inverse of the magnitude of<br>
the masking threshold M(f), i.e. such that the following<br>
applies:<br><br>
wherein the dependence of t in turn is to illustrate that<br>
the masking threshold M(f) changes for different audio<br>
blocks. When implementing the pre-filter 30 as the adaptive<br>
filter mentioned above, the filter coefficients atk will be<br>
obtained as follows: the inverse discrete Fourier transform<br>
of |M(f, t)|2 over the frequency for the block at the time t<br>
results in the target auto-correlation function rtmm(i).<br>
Then, the atk are obtained by solving the linear equation<br>
system:<br><br>
In order for no instabilities to arise between the<br>
parameterizations in the linear interpolation described in<br>
greater detail below, a lattice structure is preferably<br>
used for the filter 30, wherein the filter coefficients for<br>
the lattice structure are re-parameterized to form<br><br>
reflection coefficients. With regard to further details as<br>
to the design of the pre-filter, the calculation of the<br>
coefficients and the re-parameterization, reference is made<br>
to the article by Schuller etc. mentioned in the<br>
introduction to the description and, in particular, to page<br>
381, division III, which is incorporated herein by<br>
reference.<br>
Whereas consequently the means 24 calculates a<br>
parameterization for the parameterizable pre-filter 30 such<br>
that the transfer function thereof equals the inverse of<br>
the masking threshold, the means 22 calculates a noise<br>
power limit based on the listening threshold, namely a<br>
limit indicating which noise power the quantizer 28 is<br>
allowed to introduce into the audio signal filtered by the<br>
pre-filter 30 in order for the quantizing noise on the<br>
decoder side to be below the listening threshold M(f) or<br>
exactly equal it after post- or reverse-filtering. The<br>
means 22 calculates this noise power limit as the area<br>
below the square of the magnitude of the listening<br>
threshold M, i.e. as Σ|M(f)|2. The means 22 calculates the<br>
amplification value a from the noise power limit by<br>
calculating the root of the fraction of the quantizing<br>
noise power divided by the noise power limit. The<br>
quantizing noise is the noise caused by the quantizer 28.<br>
The noise caused by the quantizer 28 is, as will be<br>
described below, white noise and thus frequency-<br>
independent. The quantizing noise power is the power of the<br>
quantizing noise.<br>
As has become evident from the above description, the means<br>
22 also calculates the noise power limit apart from the<br>
amplification value a. Although it is possible for the node<br>
comparing means 26 to again calculate the noise power limit<br>
from the amplification value a obtained from the means 22,<br>
it is also possible for the means 22 to also transmit the<br>
noise power limit determined to the node comparing means 2 6<br>
apart from the amplification value a.<br><br>
After calculating the amplification value and the<br>
parameterization, the node comparing means 26 checks in<br>
step 66 whether the parameterization just calculated<br>
differs by more than a predetermined threshold from the<br>
current last parameterization passed on to the<br>
parameterizable pre-filter. If the check in step 66 has the<br>
result that the parameterization just calculated differs<br>
from the current one by more than the predetermined<br>
threshold, the filter coefficients just calculated and the<br>
amplification value just calculated or noise power limit<br>
are buffered in the node comparing means 26 for an<br>
interpolation to be discussed and the node comparing means<br>
26 hands over to the pre-filter 30 the filter coefficients<br>
just calculated in step 68 and the amplification value just<br>
calculated in step 70. If, however, this is not the case<br>
and the parameterization just calculated does not differ<br>
from the current one by more than the predetermined<br>
threshold, the node comparing means (26) will hand over to<br>
the pre-filter 30 in step 72, instead of the<br>
parameterization just calculated, only the current node<br>
parameterization, i.e. that parameterization which last<br>
resulted in a positive result in step 66, i.e. differed<br>
from a previous node parameterization by more than a<br>
predetermined threshold. After steps 70 and 72, the process<br>
of Fig. 3 returns to processing the next audio block, i.e.<br>
to a query 60.<br>
In the case that the parameterization just calculated does<br>
not differ from the current node parameterization and<br>
consequently the pre-filter 30 in step 72 again obtains the<br>
node parameterization already obtained for at least the<br>
last audio block, the pre-filter 30 will apply this node<br>
parameterization to all the sample values of this audio<br>
block in the FIFO 32, as will be described in greater<br>
detail below, which is how this current block is taken out<br>
of the FIFO 32 and the quantizer 28 receives a resulting<br>
audio block of pre-filtered audio values.<br><br>
Fig. 4 illustrates the mode of functioning of the<br>
parameterizable pre-filter 30 for the case it receives the<br>
parameterization just calculated and the amplification<br>
value just calculated, because they differ sufficiently<br>
from the current node parameterization in greater detail.<br>
As has been described referring to Fig. 3, there is no<br>
processing according to Fig. 4 for each of the successive<br>
audio blocks, but only for audio blocks where the<br>
respective parameterization differed sufficiently from the<br>
current node parameterization. The other audio blocks are,<br>
as has just been described, pre-filtered by applying the<br>
respective current node parameterization and the pertaining<br>
respective current amplification value to all the sample<br>
values of these audio blocks.<br>
In step 80, the parameterizable pre-filter 30 checks<br>
whether a handover of filter coefficients just calculated<br>
from the node comparing means 26 has taken place, or of<br>
older node parameterizations. The pre-filter 30 performs<br>
the check 80 until such a handover has taken place.<br>
As soon as such a handover has taken place, the<br>
parameterizable pre-filter 30 starts processing the current<br>
audio block of audio values just in the buffer 32, i.e.<br>
that one for which the parameterization has just been<br>
calculated. In Fig. 5a, it is for example illustrated that<br>
all the audio values 56 in front of the audio value with<br>
number 0 have already been processed and have thus already<br>
passed the memory 32. The processing of the block of audio<br>
values in front of the audio value with number 0 was<br>
triggered because the parameterization calculated for the<br>
audio block in front of block 0, namely x0(i), differed<br>
from the node parameterization passed on before to the pre-<br>
filter 30 by more than the predetermined threshold. The<br>
parameterization x0(i) thus is a node parameterization as<br>
is described in the present invention. The processing of<br>
the audio values in the audio block in front of the audio<br><br>
value 0 was performed on the basis of the parameter set a0,<br>
x0(i) .<br>
It is assumed in Fig. 5a that the parameterization having<br>
been calculated for block 0 with the audio values 0 - 127<br>
differed by less than the predetermined threshold from the<br>
parameterization x0(i) which referred to the block in<br>
front. This block 0 was thus also taken out of the FIFO 32<br>
by the pre-filter 30, equally processed with regard to all<br>
its sample values 0 - 127 by means of the parameterization<br>
Xo(i) supplied in step 72, as is indicated by the arrow 81<br>
described by "direct application", and then passed on to<br>
the quantizer 28.<br>
The parameterization calculated for block 1 still located<br>
in the FIFO 32, however, in contrast differed, according to<br>
the illustrative example of Fig. 5a, by more than the<br>
predetermined threshold from the parameterization x0(i) and<br>
was thus passed on in step 68 to the pre-filter 30 as a<br>
parameterization x1(i), together with the amplification<br>
value a1 (step 70) and, if applicable, the pertaining noise<br>
power limit, wherein the indices of a and x in Fig. 5 are<br>
to be an index for the nodes, as are used in the<br>
interpolation to be discussed below, which is performed<br>
with regard to the sample values 128 - 255 in block 1,<br>
symbolized by an arrow 82 and realized by the steps<br>
following step 80 in Fig. 4. The processing at step 80<br>
would thus start with the occurrence of the audio block<br>
with number 1.<br>
At the time when the parameter set a1, x1 is passed on,<br>
only the audio values 128 - 255, i.e. the current audio<br>
block after the last audio block 0 processed by the pre-<br>
filter 30, are in the memory 32. After determining the<br>
handover of node parameters x1(i) in step 80, the pre-<br>
filter 30 determines the noise power limit q1 corresponding<br>
to the amplification value a1 in step 84. This may take<br>
place by the node comparing means 26 passing on this value<br><br>
to the pre-filter 30 or by the pre-filter 30 again<br>
calculating this value, as has been described above<br>
referring to step 64.<br>
After that, an index j is initialized to a sample value in<br>
step 86 to point to the oldest sample value remaining in<br>
the FIFO memory 32 or the first sample value of the current<br>
audio block "block 1", i.e. in the present example of Fig.<br>
5 the sample value 128. In step 88, the parameterizable<br>
pre-filter performs an interpolation between the filter<br>
coefficients x0 and x1, wherein here the parameterization x0<br>
acts as a node at the node having the audio value number<br>
127 of the previous block 0 and the parameterization x1<br>
acts as a node at the node having the audio value number<br>
255 of the current block 1. These audio value positions 127<br>
and 255 will subsequently be referred to as node 0 and node<br>
1, wherein the node parameterizations referring to the<br>
nodes in Fig. 5a are indicated by the arrows 90 and 92.<br>
In step 88, the parameterizable pre-filter 30 performs the<br>
interpolation of the filter coefficients x0, x1 between the<br>
two nodes in the form of a linear interpolation to obtain<br>
the interpolated filter coefficients at the sample position<br>
j, i.e. x(tj) (i) , i = 1 ... N.<br>
After that, namely in step 90, the parameterizable pre-<br>
filter 30 performs an interpolation between the noise power<br>
limit q1 and q0 to obtain an interpolated noise power limit<br>
at the sample position j, i.e. q(tj).<br>
In step 92, the parameterizable pre-filter 30 subsequently<br>
calculates the amplification value for the sample position<br>
j on the basis of the interpolated noise power limit and<br>
the quantizing noise power, and preferably also the<br>
interpolated filter coefficients, namely for example<br>
depending on the root of  wherein<br><br>
for this reference is made to the explanations of step 64<br>
of Fig. 3.<br>
In step 94, the parameterizable pre-filter 30 then applies<br>
the amplification value calculated and the interpolated<br>
filter coefficients to the sample value at the sample<br>
position j to obtain a filtered sample value for this<br>
sample position, namely s'(tj).<br>
In step 96, the parameterizable pre-filter 30 then checks<br>
whether the sample position j has reached the current node,<br>
i.e. node 1, in the case of Fig. 5a the sample position<br>
255, i.e. the sample value for which the parameterization<br>
transferred to the parameterizable pre-filter 30 plus<br>
amplification value is to be valid directly, i.e. without<br>
interpolation. If this is not the case, the parameterizable<br>
pre-filter 30 will increase or increment the index j by 1,<br>
wherein steps 88 - 96 will be repeated. If the check in<br>
step 96, however, is positive, the parameterizable pre-<br>
filter will apply, in step 100, the last amplification<br>
value transmitted from the node comparing means 26 and the<br>
last filter coefficients transmitted from the node<br>
comparing means 26 directly without an interpolation to the<br>
sample value at the new node, whereupon the current block,<br>
i.e. in the present case block 1, has been processed, and<br>
the process is performed again at step 80 relative to the<br>
subsequent block to be processed which, depending on<br>
whether the parameterization of the next audio block block<br>
2 differs sufficiently from the parameterization x1(i), may<br>
be this next audio block block 2 or else a later audio<br>
block.<br>
Before the further procedure when processing the filtered<br>
sample values s' will be described referring to Fig. 5, the<br>
purpose and background of the procedure of Figs. 3 and 4<br>
will be described below. The purpose of filtering is<br>
filtering the audio signal at the input 12 with an adaptive<br>
filter, the transfer function of which is continually<br><br>
adjusted to the inverse of the listening threshold to the<br>
best degree possible, which also changes over time. The<br>
reason for this is that, on the decoder side, the reverse-<br>
filtering the transfer function of which is correspondingly<br>
continuously adjusted to the listening threshold shapes the<br>
white quantizing noise introduced by quantizing the<br>
filtered audio signal, i.e. the frequency-constant<br>
quantizing noise, by an adaptive filter, namely adjusts<br>
same to the form of the listening threshold.<br>
The application of the amplification value in steps 94 and<br>
100 in the pre-filter 30 is a multiplication of the audio<br>
signal or the filtered audio signal, i.e. the sample values<br>
s or the filtered sample values s', by the amplification<br>
factor. The purpose is to set by this the quantizing noise<br>
introduced into the filtered audio signal by the<br>
quantization described in greater detail below, and which<br>
is adjusted by the reverse-filtering on the decoder side to<br>
the form of the listening threshold, as high as possible<br>
without exceeding the listening threshold. This can be<br>
exemplified by Parsevals formula according to which the<br>
square of the magnitude of a function equals the square of<br>
the magnitude of the Fourier transform. When on the decoder<br>
side the multiplication of the audio signal in the pre-<br>
filter by the amplification value is reversed again by<br>
dividing the filtered audio signal by the amplification<br>
value, the quantizing noise power is also reduced, namely<br>
by the factor a-2, a being the amplification value.<br>
Consequently, the quantizing noise power can be set to an<br>
optimally high degree by applying the amplification value<br>
in the pre-filter 30, which is synonymous to the quantizing<br>
step size being increased and thus the number of quantizing<br>
steps to be coded being reduced, which in turn increases<br>
the compression in the subsequent redundancy reduction<br>
part.<br>
Put differently, the effect of the pre-filter could be<br>
considered as a normalization of the signal to its masking<br><br>
threshold, so that the level of the quantizing<br>
interferences or quantizing noise can be kept constant in<br>
both time and frequency. Since the audio signal is in the<br>
time domain, the quantization may thus be performed step by<br>
step with a uniform constant quantization, as will be<br>
described subsequently. In this way, ideally any possible<br>
irrelevance is removed from the audio signal and a lossless<br>
compression scheme may be used to also remove the remaining<br>
redundancy in the pre-filtered and quantized audio signal,<br>
as will be described below.<br>
Referring to Fig. 5a, it is again to be pointed out<br>
explicitly that of course the filter coefficients and<br>
amplification values a0, a1, x0, x1 used must be available<br>
on the decoder side as side information, that the transfer<br>
complexity of this, however, is decreased by not simply<br>
using new filter coefficients and new amplification values<br>
for each block. Rather, a threshold value check 66 takes<br>
place to only transfer the parameterizations as side<br>
information with a sufficient parameterization change and<br>
to otherwise not transfer the side information or<br>
parameterizations. An interpolation from the old to the new<br>
parameterization takes place at the audio blocks for which<br>
the parameterizations have been transferred. The<br>
interpolation of the filter coefficients takes place in the<br>
manner described above referring to step 88. The<br>
interpolation with regard to the amplification takes place<br>
by a detour, namely via a linear interpolation 90 of the<br>
noise power limit q0, q1. Compared to a direct<br>
interpolation via the amplification value, the linear<br>
interpolation results in a better listening result or fewer<br>
audible artifacts with regard to the noise power limit.<br>
Subsequently, the further processing of the pre-filtered<br>
signal will be described referring to Fig. 6, which<br>
basically includes quantization and redundancy reduction.<br>
First, the filtered sample values output by the<br>
parameterizable pre-filter 30 are stored in the buffer 38<br><br>
and at the same time let pass from the buffer 38 to the<br>
multiplier 40 where there are, since it is their first<br>
pass, at first passed on unchanged, namely with a scaling<br>
factor of one, by the multiplier 40 to the quantizer 28.<br>
There, the filtered audio values above an upper limit are<br>
cut in step 110 and then quantized in step 112. The two<br>
steps 110 and 112 are executed by the quantizer 28. In<br>
particular, the two steps 110 and 112 are preferably<br>
executed by the quantizer 28 in one step by quantizing the<br>
filtered audio values s' by a quantizing step function<br>
which maps the filtered sample values s' exemplarily<br>
present in a floating point illustration to a plurality of<br>
integer quantizing step values or indices and which has a<br>
flat course for the filtered sample values from a certain<br>
threshold value on so that filtered sample values greater<br>
than the threshold value are quantized to one and the same<br>
quantizing step. An example of such a quantizing step<br>
function is illustrated in Fig. 7a.<br>
The quantized filtered sample values are referred to by σ'<br>
in Fig. 7a. The quantizing step function preferably is a<br>
quantizing step function with a step size which is constant<br>
below the threshold value, i.e. the jump to the next<br>
quantizing step will always take place after a constant<br>
interval along the input values S'. In the implementation,<br>
the step size to the threshold value is adjusted such that<br>
the number of quantizing steps preferably corresponds to a<br>
power of 2. Compared to the floating point illustration of<br>
the incoming filtered sample values s' , the threshold value<br>
is smaller so that a maximum value of the illustratable<br>
region of the floating point illustration exceeds the<br>
threshold value.<br>
The reason for this threshold value is that it has been<br>
observed that the filtered audio signal output by the pre-<br>
filter 30 occasionally comprises audio values adding up to<br>
very large values due to an unfavorable accumulation of<br>
harmonic waves. Furthermore, it has been observed that<br><br>
cutting these values, as is achieved by the quantizing step<br>
function shown in Fig. 7a, results in a high data<br>
reduction, but only in a minor impairment of the audio<br>
quality. Rather, these occasional locations in the filtered<br>
audio signal are formed artificially by a frequency-<br>
selective filtering in the parameterizable filter 30 so<br>
that cutting them impairs audio quality only to a minor<br>
extent.<br>
A somewhat more specific example of the quantizing step<br>
function shown in Fig. 7a would be one which rounds all the<br>
filtered sample values s' to the next integer up to the<br>
threshold value, and from then on quantizes all filtered<br>
sample values above to the highest quantizing step, such<br>
as, for example, 256. This case is illustrated in Fig. 7a.<br>
Another example of a possible quantizing step function<br>
would be the one shown in Fig. 7b. Up to the threshold<br>
value, the quantizing step function of Fig. 7b corresponds<br>
to that of Fig. 7a. Instead of having an abruptly flat<br>
course for sample values s' above the threshold value,<br>
however, the quantizing step function continues with a<br>
steepness smaller than the steepness in the region below<br>
the threshold value. Put differently, the quantizing step<br>
size is greater above the threshold value. By this, a<br>
similar effect is achieved like by the quantizing function<br>
of Fig. 7a, but, on the one hand, with more complexity due<br>
to the different step sizes of the quantizing step function<br>
above and below the threshold value and, on the other hand,<br>
improved audio quality, since very high filtered audio<br>
values s' are not cut off completely but only quantized<br>
with greater a quantizing step size.<br>
As has already been described before, on the decoder side<br>
not only the quantized and filtered audio values σ' must be<br>
available, but also the input parameters for the pre-filter<br>
30 being the basis of filtering these values, namely the<br>
node parameterization including a hint to the pertaining<br><br>
amplification value. In step 114, the compressor 34 thus<br>
performs a first compression trial and thus compresses side<br>
information containing the amplification values a0 and a1<br>
at the nodes, such as, for example, 127 and 255, and the<br>
filter coefficients x0 and x1 at the nodes and the<br>
quantized filtered sample values σ' to a temporally<br>
filtered signal. The compressor 34 thus is a losslessly<br>
operating coder, such as, for example, a Huffman or<br>
arithmetic coder with or without prediction and/or<br>
adaptation.<br>
The memory 38 which the sampled audio values σ' pass<br>
through serves as a buffer for a suitable block size with<br>
which the compressor 34 processes the quantized, filtered<br>
and also scaled, as will be described before, audio values<br>
Σ' output by the quantizer 28. The block size may differ<br>
from the block size of the audio blocks as are used by the<br>
means 20.<br>
As has already been mentioned, the bit rate controller 36<br>
has controlled the multiplexer 40 by a multiplicand of 1<br>
for the first compression trial so that the filtered audio<br>
values go unchanged from the pre-filter 30 to the quantizer<br>
28 and from there as quantized filtered audio values to the<br>
compressor 34. The compressor 34 monitors in step 116<br>
whether a certain compression block size, i.e. a certain<br>
number of quantized sampled audio values, has been coded<br>
into the temporary coded signal, or whether further<br>
quantized filtered audio values a' are to be coded into the<br>
current temporary coded signal. If the compression block<br>
size has not been reached, the compressor 34 will continue<br>
performing the current compression 114. If the compression<br>
block size, however, has been reached, the bit rate<br>
controller 36 will check in step 118 whether the bit<br>
quantity required for the compression is greater than a bit<br>
quantity dictated by a desired bit rate. If this is not the<br>
case, the bit rate controller 36 will check in step 120<br>
whether the bit quantity required is smaller than the bit<br><br>
quantity dictated by the desired bit rate. If this is the<br>
case, the bit rate controller 36 will fill up the coded<br>
signal in step 122 with filler bits until the bit quantity<br>
dictated by the desired bit rate has been reached.<br>
Subsequently, the coded signal is output in step 124. As an<br>
alternative to step 122, the bit rate controller 36 could<br>
pass on the compression block of filtered audio values a'<br>
still stored in the memory 38 on which the last compression<br>
has been based in a form multiplied by a multiplicand<br>
greater than 1 by the multiplier 40 to the quantizer 28 for<br>
again passing steps 110 - 118, until the bit quantity<br>
dictated by the desired bit rate has been reached, as is<br>
indicated by a step 125 illustrated in broken lines.<br>
If, however, the check in step 118 results in that the<br>
required bit quantity is greater than the one dictated by<br>
the desired bit rate, the bit rate controller 36 will<br>
change the multiplicand for the multiplier 40 to a factor<br>
between 0 and 1 exclusive. This is performed in step 126.<br>
After step 126, the bit rate controller 36 provides for the<br>
memory 38 to again output the last compression block of<br>
filtered audio values σ' on which the compression has been<br>
based, wherein they are subsequently multiplied by the<br>
factor set in step 126 and again supplied to the quantizer<br>
28, whereupon steps 110 - 118 are performed again and the<br>
up to then temporarily coded signal is disposed of.<br>
It is to be pointed out that when performing steps 110 -<br>
116 again, in step 114 of course the factor used in step<br>
126 (or step 125) is also integrated into the coded signal.<br>
The purpose of the procedure after step 126 is increasing<br>
the effective step size of the quantizer 28 by the factor.<br>
This means that the resulting quantizing noise is uniformly<br>
above the masking threshold, which results in audible<br>
interferences or audible noise, but results in a reduced<br>
bit rate. If, after passing steps 110 - 116 again, it is<br>
again determined in step 118 that the required bit quantity<br><br>
is greater than the one dictated by the desired bit rate,<br>
the factor will be reduced again in step 126, etc.<br>
If the data is finally output at step 124 as a coded<br>
signal, the next compression block will be performed from<br>
the subsequent quantized filtered audio values σ'.<br>
It is also to be pointed out that another pre-initialized<br>
value than 1 could be used as the multiplication factor,<br>
namely, for example, 1. Then, scaling would take place in<br>
any case at first, i.e. at the very top of Fig. 6.<br>
Fig. 5b illustrates again the resulting coded signal which<br>
is generally indicated by 130. The coded signal includes<br>
side information and main data therebetween. The side<br>
information includes, as has already been mentioned,<br>
information from which for special audio blocks, namely<br>
audio blocks where a significant change in the filter<br>
coefficients has resulted in the sequence of audio blocks,<br>
the value of the amplification value and the value of the<br>
filter coefficients can be derived. If necessary, the side<br>
information will include further information relating to<br>
the amplification value used for the bit controller. Due to<br>
the mutual dependence of the amplification value and the<br>
noise power limit q, the side information may optionally,<br>
apart from the amplification value a# to a node #, also<br>
include the noise power limit q#, or only the latter. The<br>
side information is preferably arranged within the coded<br>
signal such that the side information to filter<br>
coefficients and pertaining amplification value or<br>
pertaining noise power limit is arranged in front of the<br>
main data to the audio block of quantized filtered audio<br>
values σ', from which these filter coefficients with<br>
pertaining amplification values or pertaining noise power<br>
limit have been derived, i.e. the side information a0,<br>
x0(i) after block -1 and the side information a1, x1(i)<br>
after block 1. Put differently, the main data, i.e. the<br>
quantized filtered audio values Σ' , starting from,<br><br>
excluding, an audio block of the kind where a significant<br>
change in the sequence of audio blocks has resulted in the<br>
filter coefficients, up to, including, the next audio block<br>
of this kind, in Fig. 5, for example, the audio values<br>
σ' (t0) - σ' (t255) , will always be arranged between the side<br>
information block 132 to the first one of these two audio<br>
blocks (block -1) and the other side information block 134<br>
to the second one of the two audio blocks (block 1) . The<br>
audio values σ' (to) - σ' (t127) are decodable or have been,<br>
as has been mentioned before referring to Fig. 5a, obtained<br>
only by means of the side information 132, whereas the<br>
audio values σ' (t128) - σ' (t255) have been obtained by<br>
interpolation by means of the side information 132 as<br>
support values at the node with the sample value number 127<br>
and by means of the side information 134 as support values<br>
at the node with the sample value number 255 and are thus<br>
decodable only by means of both side information.<br>
In addition, the side information regarding the<br>
amplification value or the noise power limit and the filter<br>
coefficients in each side information block 132 and 134 are<br>
not always integrated independently of each other. Rather,<br>
this side information is transferred in differences to the<br>
previous side information block. In Fig. 5b for example,<br>
the side information block 132 contains the amplification<br>
value a0 and filter coefficients x0 with regard to the node<br>
at the time t-1. In the side information block 132, these<br>
values may be derived from the block itself. From the side<br>
information block 134, however, the side information<br>
regarding the node at the time t255 may no longer be derived<br>
from this block alone. Rather, the side information block<br>
134 only includes information on differences of the<br>
amplification value a1 of the node at the time t255 and the<br>
amplification value of the node at the time t0 and the<br>
differences of the filter coefficients x1 and the filter<br>
coefficients x0. The side information block 134<br>
consequently only contains the information on a1 - a0 and<br>
x1(i) - x0(i). At intermitting times, however, the filter<br><br>
coefficients and the amplification value or the noise power<br>
limit should be transferred completely and not only as a<br>
difference to the previous node, such as, for example, each<br>
second to allow a receiver or decoder latching into a<br>
running stream of coding data, as will be discussed below.<br>
This kind of integrating the side information into the side<br>
information blocks 132 and 134 offers the advantage of the<br>
possibility of a higher compression rate. The reason for<br>
this is that, although the side information will, if<br>
possible, only be transferred if a sufficient change of the<br>
filter coefficients to the filter coefficients of a<br>
previous node has resulted, the complexity of calculating<br>
the difference on the coder side or calculating the sum on<br>
the decoder side pays off since the resulting differences<br>
are small in spite of the query of step 66 to thus allow<br>
advantages in entropy coding.<br>
After an embodiment of an audio coder has been described<br>
before, an embodiment of an audio decoder which is suitable<br>
for decoding the coded signal generated by the audio coder<br>
10 of Fig. 1 to a decoded playable or processable audio<br>
signal will be described subsequently.<br>
The setup of this decoder is shown in Fig. 8. The decoder<br>
generally indicated by 210 includes a decompressor 212, a<br>
FIFO memory 214, a multiplier 216 and a parameterizable<br>
post-filter 218. The decompressor 212, the FIFO memory 214,<br>
the multiplier 216 and the parameterizable post-filter 218<br>
are connected in this order between a data input 220 and a<br>
data output 222 of the decoder 210, wherein the coded<br>
signal is received at the data input 220 and the decoded<br>
audio signal only differing from the original audio signal<br>
at the data input 12 of the audio coder 10 by the<br>
quantizing noise generated by the quantizer 28 in the audio<br>
coder 10 is output at the data output 222. The decompressor<br>
212 is connected to a control input of the multiplier 216<br>
at another data output to pass on a multiplicand to same,<br><br>
and to a parameterization input of the parameterizable<br>
post-filter 218 via another data output.<br>
As is shown in Fig. 9, the decompressor 212 at first<br>
decompresses in step 224 the compressed signal at the data<br>
input 220 to obtain the quantized filtered audio data,<br>
namely the sample values σ', and the pertaining side<br>
information in the side information blocks 132, 134, which,<br>
as is known, indicate the filter coefficients and<br>
amplification values or, instead of the amplification<br>
values, the noise power limits at the nodes.<br>
As is shown in Fig. 10, the decompressor 212 checks the<br>
decompressed signal in the order of appearance in step 226<br>
whether side information with filter coefficients is<br>
contained therein, in a self-contained form without a<br>
difference reference to a previous side information block.<br>
Put differently, the decompressor 212 looks for the first<br>
side information block 132. As soon as the decompressor 212<br>
has found something, the quantized filtered audio values a'<br>
are buffered in the FIFO memory 214 in step 228. If a<br>
complete audio block of quantized filtered audio values a'<br>
has been stored during step 228 without a directly<br>
following side information block, it will at first be post-<br>
filtered in step 228 by means of the information contained<br>
in the side information received in step 226 on<br>
parameterization and amplification value in a post-filter<br>
and amplified in the multiplier 216, which is how it is<br>
decoded and thus the pertaining decoded audio block is<br>
achieved.<br>
In step 230, the decompressor 212 monitors the decompressed<br>
signal for the occurrence of any kind of side information<br>
block, namely with absolute filter coefficients or filter<br>
coefficients differences to a previous side information<br>
block. In the example of Fig. 5b, the decompressor 212<br>
would, for example, recognize the occurrence of the side<br>
information block 134 in step 230 upon recognizing the side<br><br>
information block 132 in step 226. Thus, the block of<br>
quantized filtered audio values σ' (t0) - Σ' (t127) would have<br>
been decoded in step 228, using the side information 132.<br>
As long as the side information block 134 in the<br>
decompressed signal has not yet occurred, the buffering<br>
and, maybe, decoding of blocks is continued in step 228 by<br>
means of the side information of step 226, as has been<br>
described before.<br>
As soon as the side information block 132 has occurred, the<br>
decompressor 212 will calculate the parameter values at the<br>
node 1, i.e. a1, x1(i), in step 232 by adding up the<br>
difference values in the side information block 134 and the<br>
parameter values in the side information block 132. Step<br>
232 is of course omitted if the current side information<br>
block is a self-contained side information block without<br>
differences, which, as has been described before, may<br>
exemplarily occur every second. In order for the waiting<br>
time for the decoder 210 not to be too long, side<br>
information blocks 132 where the parameter values may be<br>
derived absolutely, i.e. with no relation to another side<br>
information block, are arranged in sufficiently small<br>
distances so that the turn-on time or down time when<br>
switching on the audio coder 210 in the case of, for<br>
example, a radio transmission or broadcast transmission is<br>
not too large. Preferably, the number of side information<br>
blocks 132 arranged therebetween with the difference values<br>
are arranged in a fixed predetermined number between the<br>
side information blocks 132 so that the decoder knows when<br>
a side information block of type 132 is again to be<br>
expected in the coded signal. Alternatively, the different<br>
side information block types are indicated by corresponding<br>
flags.<br>
As is shown in Fig. 11, after a side information block for<br>
a new node has been reached, in particular after step 226<br>
or 232, a sample value index j is at first initialized to 0<br>
in step 234. This value corresponds to the sample position<br><br>
of the first sample value in the audio block currently<br>
remaining in the FIFO 214 to which the current side<br>
information relates. Step 234 is performed by the<br>
parameterizable post-filter 218. The post-filter 218 then<br>
calculates the noise power limit at the new node in step<br>
236, wherein this step corresponds to step 84 of Fig. 4 and<br>
may be omitted when, for example, the noise power limit at<br>
the nodes is transmitted in addition to the amplification<br>
values. In subsequent steps 238 and 240, the post-filter<br>
218 performs interpolations with regard to the filter<br>
coefficients and the noise power limit corresponding to the<br>
interpolations 88 and 90 of Fig. 4. The subsequent<br>
calculation of the amplification value for the sample<br>
position j on the basis of the interpolated noise power<br>
limit and the interpolated filter coefficients of steps 238<br>
and 240 in step 242 corresponds to step 92 of Fig. 4. In<br>
step 244, the post-filter 218 applies the amplification<br>
value calculated in step 242 and the interpolated filter<br>
coefficients to the sample value at the sample position j.<br>
This step differs from step 94 of Fig. 4 by the fact that<br>
the interpolated filter coefficients are applied to the<br>
quantized filtered sample values σ' such that the transfer<br>
function of the parameterizable post-filter does not<br>
correspond to the inverse of the listening threshold, but<br>
to the listening threshold itself. In addition, the post-<br>
filter does not perform a multiplication by the<br>
amplification value, but a division by the amplification<br>
value at the quantized filtered sample values σ' or the<br>
already reverse-filtered, quantized filtered sample value<br>
at the position j.<br>
If the post-filter 218 has not yet reached the current node<br>
with the sample position j, which it checks in step 246, it<br>
will increment the sample position index j in step 248 and<br>
start steps 238 - 246 again. Only when the node has been<br>
reached, it will apply the amplification value and the<br>
filter coefficients of the new node to the sample value at<br>
the node, namely in step 250. The application in turn<br><br>
includes, like in step 218, a division by means of the<br>
amplification value and filtering with a transfer function<br>
equaling the listening threshold and not the inverse of the<br>
latter, instead of a multiplication. After step 250, the<br>
current audio block is decoded by an interpolation between<br>
two node parameterizations.<br>
As has already been mentioned, the noise introduced by the<br>
quantization when coding in step 110 or 112 is adjusted in<br>
both shape and magnitude to the listening threshold by the<br>
filtering and the application of an amplification value in<br>
steps 218 and 224.<br>
It is also to be pointed out that in the case that the<br>
quantized filtered audio values have been subjected to<br>
another multiplication in step 126 due to the bit rate<br>
controller before being coded into the coded signal, this<br>
factor may also be considered in steps 218 and 224.<br>
Alternatively, the audio values obtained by the process of<br>
Fig. 11 could of course be subjected to another<br>
multiplication to correspondingly amplify again the audio<br>
values weakened by a lower bit rate.<br>
With regard to Figs. 3, 4, 6 and 9 - 11, it is pointed out<br>
that same show flow charts illustrating the mode of<br>
functioning of the coder of Fig. 1 or the decoder of Fig. 8<br>
and that each of the steps illustrated in the flow chart by<br>
a block, as described, is implemented in corresponding<br>
means, as has been described before. The implementation of<br>
the individual steps may be realized in hardware, as an<br>
ASIC circuit part, or in software, as subroutines. In<br>
particular, the explanations written into the blocks in<br>
these figures roughly indicate to which process the<br>
respective step corresponding to the respective block<br>
refers, whereas the arrows between the blocks illustrate<br>
the order of the steps when operating the coder and<br>
decoder, respectively.<br><br>
Referring to the previous description, it is pointed out<br>
again that the coding scheme illustrated above may be<br>
varied in many regards. Exemplarily, it is not necessary<br>
for a parameterization and an amplification value or a<br>
noise power limit, as were determined for a certain audio<br>
block, to be considered as directly valid for a certain<br>
audio value, like in the previous embodiment the last<br>
respective audio value of each audio block, i.e. the 128th<br>
value in this audio block so that interpolation for this<br>
audio value may be omitted. Rather, it is possible to<br>
relate these node parameter values to a node which is<br>
temporally between the sample times tn, n = 0, ..., 127, of<br>
the audio values of this audio block so that an<br>
interpolation would be necessary for each audio value. In<br>
particular, the parameterization determined for an audio<br>
block or the amplification value determined for this audio<br>
block may also be applied indirectly to another value, such<br>
as, for example, the audio value in the middle of the audio<br>
block, such as, for example, the 64th audio value in the<br>
case of the above block size of 128 audio values.<br>
Additionally, it is pointed out that the above embodiment<br>
referred to an audio coding scheme designed for generating<br>
a coded signal with a controlled bit rate. Controlling the<br>
bit rate, however, is not necessary for every case of<br>
application. This is why the corresponding steps 116 to 122<br>
and 126 may also be omitted.<br>
With reference to the compression scheme mentioned<br>
referring to step 114, for reasons of completeness,<br>
reference is made to the document by Schuller et al.<br>
described in the introduction to the description and, in<br>
particular, to division IV, the contents of which with<br>
regard to the redundancy reduction by means of lossless<br>
coding is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
In addition, the following is to be pointed out referring<br>
to the previous embodiment. Although it has been described<br><br>
before that the threshold value always remains constant<br>
when quantizing or even the quantizing step function always<br>
remains constant, i.e. the artifacts generated in the<br>
filtered audio signal are always quantized or cut off by<br>
rougher a quantization, which may impair the audio quality<br>
to an audible extent, it is also possible to only use these<br>
measures if the complexity of the audio signal requires<br>
this, namely if the bit rate required for coding exceeds a<br>
desired bit rate. In this case, in addition to the<br>
quantizing step functions shown in Figs. 7a and 7b, for<br>
example one with a quantizing step size constant over the<br>
entire range of values possible at the output of the pre-<br>
filter might be used and the quantizer would, for example,<br>
respond to a signal to use either the quantizing step<br>
function with an always constant quantizing step size or<br>
one of the quantizing step functions according to Figs. 7a<br>
or 7b so that the quantizer could be told by the signal to<br>
perform, with little audio quality impairment, the<br>
quantizing step decrease above the threshold value or<br>
cutting off above the threshold value. Alternatively, the<br>
threshold value could also be reduced gradually. In this<br>
case, the threshold value reduction could be performed<br>
instead of the factor reduction of step 126. After a first<br>
compression trial without step 110, the temporarily<br>
compressed signal could only be subjected to a selective<br>
threshold value quantization in a modified step 126 if the<br>
bit rate were still too high (118). In another pass, the<br>
filtered audio values would then be quantized with the<br>
quantizing step function having a flatter course above the<br>
audio threshold. Further bit rate reductions could be<br>
performed in the modified step 126 by reducing the<br>
threshold value and thus by another modification of the<br>
quantization step function.<br>
Furthermore, some aspects of the above embodiment are of<br>
advantage, but not necessary. Exemplarily, interpolation<br>
may be omitted in the above audio coding scheme. In<br>
addition, it would be possible to transfer the<br><br>
parameterizations and the amplification value or the<br>
parameterizations and the noise power limit with regard to<br>
each audio block with regard to which they were calculated,<br>
and not to leave out a single one when the successive<br>
parameterizations differ by less than the predetermined<br>
measure already mentioned.<br>
In addition, it would be possible to only apply the<br>
difference coding to the parameterizations, but not to the<br>
amplification value or the noise power limit.<br>
In addition, it is conceivable in the above coding scheme<br>
to transfer the filter coefficients in the difference side<br>
blocks 134 in a different manner, namely, for example, in<br>
the form of the current filter coefficients minus the<br>
previously transferred filter coefficients minus the<br>
minimum threshold of step 66.<br>
The above-described audio coding scheme consequently<br>
relates to, among other things, effectively transferring<br>
side information in an audio coder with a very small delay<br>
time. The side information having to be transferred for the<br>
decoder in order for the audio signal to be reconstructed<br>
suitably has the feature of usually changing only slowly.<br>
This is why only differences are transferred, which<br>
decreases the bit rate. In addition, they will only be<br>
transferred when there are sufficient changes. From time to<br>
time, the absolute value will be transferred in case past<br>
values were lost. Put differently, the side information<br>
from the prefilter or the coefficients are transferred such<br>
that the post-filter in the decoder has the inverse<br>
transfer function so that the audio signal may again be<br>
reconstructed suitably. The bit rate required for this is<br>
reduced by transferring differences, but only if they have<br>
a sufficient size. These differences have smaller values<br>
and occur more frequency, which is why they require fewer<br>
bits when coding. The difference coding thus particularly<br><br>
pays off since the differences will also only change<br>
steadily with continually changing audio signals.<br>
In particular, it is pointed out that, depending on the<br>
circumstances, the inventive audio coding scheme may also<br>
be implemented in software. The implementation may be on a<br>
digital storage medium, in particular on a disc or a CD<br>
having control signals which may be readout electronically,<br>
which can cooperate with a programmable computer system<br>
such that the corresponding method will be executed. In<br>
general, the invention also is in a computer program<br>
product having a program code stored on a machine-readable<br>
carrier for performing the inventive method when the<br>
computer program product runs on a computer. Put<br>
differently, the invention may also be realized as a<br>
computer program having a program code for performing the<br>
method when the computer program runs on a computer.<br>
In particular, above method steps in the blocks of the flow<br>
chart may be implemented individually or in groups of<br>
several ones together in subprogram routines.<br>
Alternatively, an implementation of an inventive device in<br>
the form of an integrated circuit is, of course, also<br>
possible where these blocks are, for example, implemented<br>
as individual circuit parts of an ASIC.<br>
In particular, it is pointed out that, depending on the<br>
circumstances, the inventive scheme may also be implemented<br>
in software. The implementation may be on a digital storage<br>
medium, in particular on a disc or a CD having control<br>
signals which may be read out electronically, which can<br>
cooperate with a programmable computer system such that the<br>
corresponding method will be executed. In general, the<br>
invention thus also is in a computer program product having<br>
a program code stored on a machine-readable carrier for<br>
performing the inventive method when the computer program<br>
runs on a computer. Put differently, the invention may also<br>
be realized as a computer program having a program code for<br><br>
performing the method when the computer program runs on a<br>
computer.<br><br>

magnitude of the listening threshold to obtain a block of decoded audio<br>
values of the audio signal.<br>
10. A method for decoding a coded signal into an audio signal, wherein<br>
the coded signal contains information from which a block of quantized<br>
filtered audio values and a version of a first parameterization according<br>
to which a transfer function of a parameterizable filter corresponds to<br>
the inverse of the magnitude of a first listening threshold may be<br>
derived, and which includes a combination between a version of a<br>
second parameterization according to which a transfer function of the<br>
parameterizable filter corresponds to the inverse of a magnitude of a<br>
second listening threshold and the version of the first parameterization<br>
following each other and including at least a difference between the<br>
version of the first parameterization and the version of the second<br>
parameterization, comprising the steps of:<br>
deriving the version of the first parameterization from the coded signal;<br>
calculating a sum between the version of the first parameterization and<br>
the difference to obtain the version of the second parameterization;<br>
and<br><br>
filtering the block of quantized filtered audio values with a<br>
parameterizable filter using the version of the second parameterization<br>
such that the transfer function thereof roughly corresponds to the<br>
magnitude of the listening threshold to obtain a block of decoded audio<br>
values of the audio signal.<br><br><br>
TITLE "DEVICES AND METHODS FOR CODING<br>
AND DECODING OF AUDIO SIGNALS"<br>
The invention relates to a device for coding an audio signal of a sequence<br>
of audio values into a coded signal, comprising: means (20) for<br>
determining a first listening threshold for a first block of audio values of<br>
the sequence of audio values and a second listening threshold for a second<br>
block of audio values of the sequence of audio values; means (24) for<br>
calculating a version of a first parameterization filter (30) such that the<br>
transfer function thereof roughly corresponds to the inverse of the<br>
magnitude of the first listening threshold and a version of a second<br>
parameterization of the parameterizable filter such that the transfer<br>
function thereof roughly corresponds to the inverse of the magnitude of<br>
the second listening threshold; means (30) for filtering a predetermined<br>
block of audio values of the sequence of audio values with the<br>
parameterizable filter using a predetermined parameterization which in a<br>
predetermined manner depends on the version of the second<br>
parameterization to obtain a block of filtered audio values corresponding to<br>
the predetermined block; means (28) for quantizing the filtered audio<br>
values to obtain a block of quantized filtered audio values; means for<br>
forming a combination of the version of the first parameterization and the<br>
version of the second parameterization following each other and including<br>
at least a difference between the version of the first parameterization and<br>
the version of the second parameterization; and means for integrating<br>
information from which the quantized filtered audio values and a version of<br>
the first parameterization may be derived and which comprises the<br>
combination into the coded signal.<br></td>
