				<td>METHOD OF ALLOCATING RADIO RESOURCES<br>
IN A WIRELESS COMMUNICATION SYSTEM<br>
[DESCRIPTION]<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a wireless communication system, and more<br>
particularly, to a method of allocating radio resources in a wireless communication<br>
system.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
In a wireless communication system which uses multiple carriers, such as an<br>
orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) or a single carrier-frequency<br>
division multiple access (SC-FDMA), radio resources are a set of continuous sub-<br>
carriers and are defined by a time-frequency region on a two-dimensional sphere. A<br>
time-frequency region is a rectangular form sectioned by time and sub-carrier<br>
coordinates. In other words, one time-frequency region could be a rectangular form<br>
sectioned by at least one symbol on a time axis and a plurality of sub-carriers on a<br>
frequency axis. Such a time-frequency region can be allocated to an uplink for a specific<br>
user equipment (UE), or an eNode B can transmit the time-frequency region to a<br>
specific user equipment in a downlink. In order to define such a time-frequency region<br>
on the two-dimensional sphere, the number of OFDM symbols and the number of<br>
continuous sub-carriers starting from a point having an offset from a reference point<br>
should be given.<br>
An evolved universal mobile telecommunications system (E-UMTS) which is<br>
currently being discussed uses 10 ms radio frame comprising 10 sub-frames. Namely,<br>
one sub-frame includes two continuous slots. One slot has a length of 0.5 ms. Also,<br>
one sub-frame comprises a plurality of OFDM symbols, and a part (for example, first<br>
symbol) of the plurality of OFDM symbols can be used for transmission of L1/L2<br>
control information.<br>
FIG. 1 illustrates an example of a structure of physical channels used in the E-<br>
UMTS. In FIG. 1, one sub-frame comprises an L1/L2 control information<br>
transmission region (hatching part) and a data transmission region (non-hatching part).<br>
FIG. 2 illustrates a general method of transmitting data in the E-UMTS. In the<br>
E-UMTS, a hybrid auto repeat request (HARQ) scheme, which is one of data<br>
retransmission schemes, is used to improve throughput, thereby enabling desirable<br>
communication.<br>
Referring to FIG. 2, the eNB transmits downlink scheduling information<br>
(hereinafter, referred to as 'DL scheduling information') through DL L1/L2 control<br>
channel, for example, a physical downlink control channel (PDCCH), to transmit data to<br>
a user equipment in accordance with the HARQ scheme, The DL scheduling<br>
information includes user equipment identifier (UE ID) or group identifier (group ID) of<br>
user equipments, location and duration (resource assignment and duration of<br>
assignment) information of radio resources allocated for transmission of downlink data,<br>
modulation mode, payload size, transmission parameters such as MIMO related<br>
information, HARQ process information, redundancy version, and new data indicator.<br>
In order to notify that DL scheduling information is transmitted through the<br>
PDCCH for what user equipment, the user equipment identifier (or group identifier), for<br>
example, a radio network temporary identifier (RNTI) is transmitted. The RNTI can be<br>
classified into a dedicated RNTI and a common RNTI, The dedicated RNTI is used<br>
for data transmission and reception to and from a user equipment of which information<br>
is registered with a eNB. The common RNTI is used if communication is performed<br>
with user equipments, which are not allocated with dedicated RNTI as their information<br>
is not registered with the eNB. Alternatively, the common RNTI is used for transmission<br>
and reception of information used commonly for a plurality of user equipments, such as<br>
system information. For example, examples of the common RNTI include RA-RNTI<br>
and T-C-RNTI, which are used during a random access procedure through a random<br>
access channel (RACH). The user equipment identifier or group identifier can be<br>
transmitted in a type of CRC masking in DL scheduling information transmitted through<br>
the PDCCH.<br>
User equipments located in a specific cell monitor the PDCCH through the<br>
L1/L2 control channel using their RNTI information, and receive DL scheduling<br>
information through the corresponding PDCCH if they successfully perform CRC<br>
decoding through their RNTI. The user equipments receive downlink data transmitted<br>
thereto through a physical downlink shared channel (PDSCH) indicated by the received<br>
DL scheduling information.<br>
A scheduling mode can be classified into a dynamic scheduling mode and a<br>
persistent or semi-persistent scheduling mode. The dynamic scheduling mode is to<br>
transmit scheduling information to a specific user equipment through the PDCCH<br>
whenever allocation of uplink or downlink resources is required for the specific user<br>
equipment. The persistent scheduling mode means that the eNB allocates downlink or<br>
uplink scheduling information to the user equipment statically during initial call<br>
establishment such as establishment of a radio bearer.<br>
In case of the persistent scheduling mode, the user equipment transmits or<br>
receives data using scheduling information previously allocated to the eNB without<br>
using DL scheduling information or UL scheduling information allocated from the eNB.<br>
For example, if the eNB previously sets a specific user equipment to allow the user<br>
equipment to receive downlink data through RRC signal and a radio resource "A" in<br>
accordance with a transport format "B" and a period "C" during establishment of a<br>
radio bearer, the user equipment can receive downlink data transmitted from the eNB<br>
using information "A", "B" and "C". Likewise, even in case that the user equipment<br>
transmits data to the eNB, the user equipment can transmit uplink data using a<br>
previously defined radio resource in accordance with previously allocated uplink<br>
scheduling information. The persistent scheduling mode is a scheduling mode that can<br>
well be applied to a service of which traffic is regular, such as voice communication.<br>
AMR codec used in voice communication, i.e., voice data generated through<br>
voice codec has a special feature. Namely, voice data are classified into a talk spurt and<br>
a silent period. The talk spurt means a voice data period generated while a person is<br>
actually talking, and the silent period means a voice data period generated while a<br>
person does not talk. For example, voice packets, which include voice data in the talk<br>
spurt, are generated per 20ms, and silent packets (SID), which include voice data in the<br>
silent period, are generated per 160ms.<br>
If the persistent scheduling mode is used for voice communication, the eNB<br>
will establish radio resources in accordance with the talk spurt. Namely, the eNB will<br>
previously establish radio resources for transmitting and receiving uplink or downlink<br>
data to and from the user equipment at an interval of 20ms during call establishment<br>
using a feature that voice packets are generated per 20ms. The user equipment receives<br>
downlink data or transmits uplink data using radio resources, which are previously<br>
established per 20ms.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
In the wireless communication system, communication can be performed in<br>
such a manner that the dynamic scheduling mode and the persistent scheduling mode<br>
are simultaneously applied to one user equipment. For example, if voice communication<br>
according to a VoIP service is performed in accordance with an HARQ scheme, the<br>
persistent scheduling mode is applied to initial transmission packets, and the dynamic<br>
scheduling mode is applied to retransmission packets. Also, if the user equipment<br>
simultaneously uses two or more services, the persistent scheduling mode can be<br>
applied to one service and the dynamic scheduling mode can be applied to the other<br>
service. In these cases, it is required that the user equipment should definitely identify<br>
whether scheduling information transmitted thereto depends on what scheduling mode,<br>
or whether the scheduling information is for initial transmission packets or<br>
retransmission packets, or whether the scheduling information is for what service.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention is directed to a method of allocating radio<br>
resources in a wireless communication system, which substantially obviates one or<br>
more problems due to limitations and disadvantages of the related art.<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide a method of allocating radio<br>
resources in a wireless communication system, in which radio resources can efficiently<br>
be used in the wireless communication system.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a method of allocating<br>
radio resources in a wireless communication system, in which a user equipment can<br>
definitely identify scheduling information according to each scheduling mode in a<br>
wireless communication system which allocates radio resources in accordance with a<br>
plurality of scheduling modes.<br>
In one aspect of the present invention, a network of a wireless communication<br>
system transmits first scheduling information to a user equipment to allocate radio<br>
resources to the user equipment in accordance with a first scheduling mode, the first<br>
scheduling information including a first user equipment identifier, and transmits second<br>
scheduling information to the user equipment to allocate radio resources to the user<br>
equipment in accordance with a second scheduling mode, the second scheduling<br>
information including a second user equipment identifier.<br>
In another aspect of the present invention, when a user equipment receives<br>
scheduling information including a user equipment identifier from a network, the user<br>
equipment transmits uplink data or receives downlink data using radio resources<br>
allocated in accordance with a first scheduling mode. When a second user equipment<br>
identifier is included in the scheduling information, the user equipment transmits uplink<br>
data or receives downlink data using radio resources allocated in accordance with a<br>
second scheduling mode.<br>
According to the present invention, the wireless communication system can<br>
efficiently use radio resources. Also, in the wireless communication system which<br>
allocates radio resources in accordance with a plurality of scheduling modes, a user<br>
equipment can definitely identify scheduling information according to each scheduling<br>
mode.<br>

BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
Hereinafter, structures, operations, and other features of the present invention<br>
will be understood readily by the preferred embodiments of the present invention,<br>
examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings. Embodiments<br>
described later are examples in which technical features of the present invention are<br>
applied to an E-UMTS (Evolved Universal Mobile Telecommunications System).<br>
FIG. 3 illustrates a network structure of an E-UMTS. An E-UMTS is a system<br>
evolving from the conventional WCDMA UMTS and its basic standardization is<br>
currently handled by the 3GPP (3rd Generation Partnership Project). The E-UMTS can<br>
also be called an LTE (Long Term Evolution) system.<br>
Referring to FIG. 3, an E-UTRAN includes eNocle Bs (hereinafter, referred to<br>
as 'eNode B' or 'eNB'), wherein respective eNBs are connected with each other through<br>
X2 interface. Also, each of eNBs is connected with a user equipment (UE) through a<br>
radio interface and connected with EPC (Evolved Packet Core) through SI interface.<br>
The EPC includes a mobility management entity/system architecture evolution<br>
(MME/SAE) gateway.<br>
Layers of a radio interface protocol between a UE and a network can be<br>
classified into a first layer L1, a second layer L2 and a third layer L3 based on three<br>
lower layers of OSI (open system interconnection) standard model widely known in<br>
communication systems. A physical layer belonging to the first layer L1 provides an<br>
information transfer service using a physical channel. A radio resource control<br>
(hereinafter, abbreviated as 'RRC') located at the third layer plays a role in controlling<br>
radio resources between the UE and the network. For this, the RRC layer enables<br>
RRC messages to be exchanged between the UE and the network. The RRC layer can<br>
be distributively located at network nodes including Node B, an AG and the like or can<br>
be independently located at either the Node B or the AG.<br>
FIG. 4 is a schematic view illustrating an E-UTRAN (UMTS terrestrial radio<br>
access network). In FIG. 4, a hatching part represents functional entities of a user plane,'<br>
and a non-hatching part represents functional entities of a control plane.<br>
FIG. 5A and FIG. 5B illustrate a structure of a radio interface protocol between<br>
the UE and the E-UTRAN, in which FIG. 5A is a schematic view of a control plane<br>
protocol and FIG. 5B is a schematic view of a user plane protocol. Referring to FIG. 5A<br>
and FIG. 5B, a radio interface protocol horizontally includes a physical layer, a data link<br>
layer, and a network layer, and vertically includes a user plane for data information<br>
transfer and a control plane for signaling transfer. The protocol layers in FIG. 5A and<br>
FIG. 5B can be classified into L1 (first layer), L2 (second layer), and L3 (third layer)<br>
based on three lower layers of the open system interconnection (OSI) standard model<br>
widely known in the communications systems.<br>
The physical layer as the first layer provides an information transfer service to<br>
an upper layer using physical channels. The physical layer (PHY) is connected to a<br>
medium access control (hereinafter, abbreviated as 'MAC') layer above the physical<br>
layer via transport channels. Data are transferred between the medium access control<br>
layer and the physical layer via the transport channels. Moreover, data are transferred<br>
between different physical layers, and more particularly, between one physical layer of a<br>
transmitting side and the other physical layer of a receiving side via the physical<br>
channels. The physical channel of the E-UMTS is modulated in accordance with an<br>
orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) scheme, and time and frequency<br>
are used as radio resources.<br>
The medium access control (hereinafter, abbreviated as 'MAC') layer of the<br>
second layer provides a service to a radio link control (hereinafter, abbreviated as<br>
'RLC') layer above the MAC layer via logical channels. The RLC layer of the second<br>
layer supports reliable data transfer. In order to effectively transmit data using IP<br>
packets (e.g., IPv4 or IPv6) within a radio-communication period having a narrow<br>
bandwidth, a PDCP layer of the second layer (L2) performs header compression to<br>
reduce the size of unnecessary control information.<br>
A radio resource control (hereinafter, abbreviated as 'RRC') layer located on a<br>
lowest part of the third layer is defined in the control plane only and is associated with<br>
configuration, reconfiguration and release of radio bearers (hereinafter, abbreviated as<br>
'RBs') to be in charge of controlling the logical, transport and physical channels. In<br>
this case, the RB means a service provided by the second layer for the data transfer<br>
between the UE and the UTRAN.<br>
As downlink transport channels carrying data from the network to the UEs,<br>
there are provided a broadcast channel (BCH) carrying system information, a paging<br>
channel (PCH) carrying paging message, and a downlink shared channel (SCH)<br>
carrying user traffic or control messages. The traffic or control messages of a<br>
downlink multicast or broadcast service can be transmitted via the downlink SCH or an<br>
additional downlink multicast channel (MCH). Meanwhile, as uplink transport<br>
channels carrying data from the UEs to the network, there are provided a random access<br>
channel (RACH) carrying an initial control message and an uplink shared channel (UL-<br>
SCH) carrying user traffic or control message.<br>
As logical channels located above the transport channels and mapped with the<br>
transport channels, there are provided a broadcast control channel (BCCH), a paging<br>
control channel (PCCH), a common control channel (CCCH), a multicast control<br>
channel (MCCH), and a multicast traffic channel (MTCH).<br>
In the E-UMTS system, an OFDM is used on the downlink and a single carrier<br>
frequency division multiple access (SC-FDMA) on the uplink. The OFDM scheme<br>
using multiple carriers allocates resources by unit of multiple sub-carriers including a<br>
group of carriers and utilizes an orthogonal frequency division multiple access<br>
(OFDMA) as an access scheme.<br>
FIG. 6 is a flow chart illustrating a procedure of a method of transmitting data<br>
in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. According to the<br>
embodiment of FIG. 6, the user equipment (UE) receives SRB packets in accordance<br>
with a dynamic scheduling mode while receiving voice data (VoIP packets) in<br>
accordance with a persistent scheduling mode. Hereinafter, description will be made<br>
only if necessary for understanding of the embodiment of the present invention, and<br>
description of a general procedure required for communication between a network and a<br>
UE will be omitted.<br>
Referring to FIG. 6, the eNode-B (eNB) allocates two UE identifiers to the UE<br>
[S61]. Examples of the two UE identifiers include a C-RNTI and an SPS-C-RNTI<br>
(Semi-Persistent Scheduling RNTI). However, the two UE identifiers will not be limited<br>
to the above examples. For example, temporary C-RNTI and RA-RNTI may be used as<br>
the two UE identifiers. The two UE identifiers can be allocated to the UE by the<br>
network during random access procedure, call establishment procedure, or radio bearer<br>
(RB) establishment procedure, etc. Also, the two UE identifiers may be allocated<br>
simultaneously or individually.<br>
The eNB transmits first scheduling information to the UE to allocate radio<br>
resources for transmission and reception of voice data [S62]. The first scheduling<br>
information can include uplink scheduling information and downlink scheduling<br>
information. The first scheduling information includes the SPS-C-RNTI to indicate that<br>
the scheduling information is allocated in accordance with the persistent scheduling<br>
mode. The SPS-C-RNTI can be included in the first scheduling information in a type of<br>
CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check) masking in at least part of the first scheduling<br>
information. The first scheduling information is set to have a format (first format)<br>
different from that of scheduling information according to the dynamic scheduling<br>
mode. The UE decodes the first scheduling information in accordance with the first<br>
format, and if the SPS-C-RNTI is included in the first scheduling information, the UE<br>
recognizes that the first scheduling information is scheduling information according to<br>
the persistent scheduling mode. The first scheduling information includes information<br>
associated with a location of radio resources allocated to the UE, an allocation period,<br>
and an allocation interval, etc. The UE transmits uplink data or receives downlink data<br>
using the radio resources allocated at an allocation period for an allocation interval in<br>
accordance with the first scheduling information.<br>
The eNB transmits an initial transmission VoIP packet V1 to the UE on the<br>
PDSCH in accordance with the first scheduling information [S63]. The initial<br>
transmission VoIP packet V1 means a voice packet which is not a retransmission packet,<br>
when the HARQ scheme is used. If the UE fails to successfully receive the initial<br>
transmission VoIP packet V1, i.e., if the UE fails to decode the initial transmission VoIP<br>
packet V1, the UE transmits NACK to the eNB on a physical uplink control channel<br>
(PUCCH) [S64]. The UE receives the initial transmission VoIP packet V1 or transmits<br>
NACK (or ACK) using the first scheduling information.<br>
When the UE receives the initial transmission VoIP packet V1 or transmits<br>
NACK (or ACK), the persistent scheduling mode is used. However, the dynamic<br>
scheduling mode is used for transmission of a retransmission VoIP packet by the eNB.<br>
Accordingly, after transmitting the NACK to the eNB, the UE should first receive<br>
scheduling information to receive the retransmission packet. To this end, the UE<br>
monitors the PDCCH of the L1/L2 control channel.<br>
In FIG, 6, the eNB transmits second scheduling information to the UE on the<br>
PDCCH [S65]. The second scheduling information is to allocate uplink and downlink<br>
channel resources in accordance with the dynamic scheduling mode, and can include<br>
downlink (DL) scheduling information and uplink (UL) scheduling information. The<br>
second scheduling information includes the C-RNTI to indicate that the second<br>
scheduling information is allocated in accordance with the dynamic scheduling mode.<br>
The C-RNTI can be included in the second scheduling information in a type of<br>
CRC(CycIic Redundancy Check) masking in at least part of the second scheduling<br>
information. The second scheduling information is set to have a format (second format)<br>
different from that of the scheduling information according to the persistent scheduling<br>
mode, i.e., the first scheduling information. The UE decodes the second scheduling<br>
information in accordance with the second format, and if the C-RNTI is included in the<br>
second scheduling information, the UE recognizes that the second scheduling<br>
information is scheduling information according to the dynamic scheduling mode. The<br>
second scheduling information includes a HARQ process identifier.<br>
The eNB transmits an initial transmission SRB packet S1 to the UE in<br>
accordance with the second scheduling information [S66]. The initial transmission SRB<br>
packet S1 means SRB packet which is not a retransmission packet, when the HARQ<br>
scheme is used. If the UE fails to successfully receive the initial transmission SRB<br>
packet S1, i.e., if the UE fails to decode the initial transmission SRB packet S1, the UE<br>
transmits NACK to the eNB on the PUCCH [S67]. The UE receives the initial<br>
transmission SRB packet S1 or transmits the NACK (or ACK) using the second<br>
scheduling information.<br>
The eNB transmits third scheduling information to the UE on PDCCH to<br>
transmit a retransmission packet V2 for the initial transmission VoIP packet V1, wherein<br>
the third scheduling information includes the SPS-C-RNTI [S68]. If the UE receives the<br>
third scheduling information which includes the SPS-C-RNTI, the UE receives the<br>
retransmission VoIP packet V2, which is transmitted from the eNB, using the third<br>
scheduling information [S69]. The UE combines the received retransmission VoIP<br>
packet V2 with the initial transmission VoIP packet V1 in accordance with the HARQ<br>
scheme to recover a VoIP packet [S70]. If the UE successfully recovers the VoIP packet,<br>
the UE transmits ACK to the eNB [S71]. The VoIP packet means a data packet intended<br>
to be transmitted from the eNB to the UE. The VoIP packet is divided into the initial<br>
transmission VoIP packet V1 and the retransmission VoIP packet V2 based on the VoIP<br>
packet and then transmitted to the UE in accordance with the HARQ scheme.<br>
The third scheduling information can include information related to a<br>
transmission timing point when the eNB transmits the initial transmission VoIP packet<br>
V1. For example, the third scheduling information can include information indicating a<br>
transport time interval (TTI) where the initial transmission VoIP packet V1 is<br>
transmitted. The UE can easily recognize that the retransmission VoIP packet V2 is a<br>
retransmission packet for the initial transmission VoIP packet, in accordance with the<br>
information related to the timing point when the eNB transmits the initial transmission<br>
VoIP packet V1 included in the third scheduling information.<br>
The eNB transmits fourth scheduling information to the UE on PDCCH to<br>
transmit a retransmission packet S2 for the initial transmission SRB packet S1, wherein<br>
the fourth scheduling information includes the C-RNTI [S72]. If the UE receives the<br>
fourth scheduling information which includes the C-RNTI, the UE receives the<br>
retransmission SRB packet S2, which is transmitted from the eNB, using the fourth<br>
scheduling information [S73], The UE combines the received retransmission SRB<br>
packet S2 with the initial transmission SRB packet S1 in accordance with the HARQ<br>
scheme to recover an SRB packet [S74]. If the UE successfully recovers the SRB packet,<br>
the UE transmits ACK to the eNB [S75]. The SRB packet means a data packet intended<br>
to be transmitted from the eNB to the UE. The SRB packet is divided into the initial<br>
transmission SRB packet S1 and the retransmission SRB packet S2 based on the SRB<br>
packet and then transmitted to the UE in accordance with the HARQ scheme. The<br>
fourth scheduling information includes the same HARQ process identifier as that<br>
included in the second scheduling information.<br>
In the embodiment of FIG. 6, the first scheduling information to the fourth<br>
scheduling information can further include identification information that can identify<br>
whether the data packet transmitted from the eNB to the UE in accordance with the first<br>
scheduling information to the fourth scheduling information is the initial transmission<br>
packet or the retransmission packet. The identification information can be included in<br>
the first scheduling information to the fourth scheduling information in such a manner<br>
that a specific field of the first scheduling information to the fourth scheduling<br>
information is set to a value which is a previously determined. For example, a first<br>
retransmission packet, a second retransmission packet, and a third retransmission packet<br>
can be identified in such a manner that specific values such as 1, 2 and 3 are set in a<br>
redundancy version (RV) field included in the first scheduling information to the fourth<br>
scheduling information. In addition to the RV field, other field included in the first<br>
scheduling information to the fourth scheduling information, for example, at least one<br>
of HARQ process ID field, format field, MCS field, NDI (New data indicator) field,<br>
TPC field, "Cyclic shift for DMRS" field, "TX antenna" field, and CQI request field is<br>
set to a specific value, whereby the set value can be used as the identification<br>
information.<br>
