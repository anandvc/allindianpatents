THE PATENTS RULES, 2003<br>
COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10; rule 13] "A METALLOPROTEINASE INHIBITOR COMPOUNDS"<br>
ASTRAZENECA   AB,   a   Swedish   company   of   S-151   85,   Sodertalje, Sweden,<br>
GRANTED<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br>
28 NOV 2005<br>
28-11-2005<br><br><br>
The present invention relates a metalloproteinase inhibitor compounds.<br>
"Co-pending patent application 804/MUMNP/2003 discloses related compounds of general structure (I) wherein the group R5 represent s a monocyclic ring system:<br>
The present application is concerned with analogous compounds wherein the group R5 represents a bicyclic or tricyclic ring system.<br>
The present invention relates to compounds useful in the inhibition of metalloproteinases and in particular to pharmaceutical compositions comprising these, as well as their use.<br>
The compounds of this invention are inhibitors of one or more metalloproteinase enzymes. Metalloproteinases are a superfamily of proteinases (enzymes) whose numbers in recent years have increased dramatically. Based on structural and functional considerations these enzymes have been classified into families and subfamilies as described in N.M. Hooper (1994) FEBS Letters 354 .1-6. Examples of metalloproteinases include the matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) such as the collagenases (MMP1, MMP8, MMP13), the gelatinases (MMP2, MMP9), the stromelysins (MMP3, MMP10, MMP11), matrilysin (MMP7), metalloelastase (MMP12), enamelysin (MMP19), the MT -MMPs (MMP14, MMP15, MMP16, MMP17); the reprolysin or adamalysin or MDC family which includes the secretases and sheddases such as TNF converting enzymes (ADAM 10 and TACE); the astacin family which include enzymes such as procollagen processing proteinase (PCP); and other metalloproteinases such as aggrecanase, the endothelin converting enzyme family and the angiotensin converting enzyme family.<br>
Metalloproteinases are believed to be important in a plethora of physi<?logical disease processes that involve tissue remodelling such as embryonic development, bone formation and uterine remodelling during menstruation. This is based on the ability of the metalloproteinases to cleave a broad range of matrix substrates such as collagen, proteoglycan and fibronectin. Metalloproteinases are also believed to be important in the processing, or secretion, of biological important cell mediators, such as tumour necrosis factor (TNF); and the post translational proteolysis processing, or shedding, of biologically important membrane proteins, such as the low affinity lgE receptor CD23 (for a more complete list see N. M. Hooper et al., (1997) Biochem J. 321:265-279).<br/>
Metalloproteinases have been associated with many diseases or conditions. Inhibition of the activiity of one or more metalloproteinases may well be of benefit in these diseases<br><br>
or conditions, for example: various inflammatory and allergic diseases such as, inflammation of the joint (especially rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis and gout), inflammation of the gastro-intestinal tract (especially inflammatory bowel disease, ulcerative colitis and gastritis), inflammation of the skin (especially psoriasis, eczema, dermatitis); in tumour metastasis or invasion; in disease associated with uncontrolled degradation of the extracellular matrix such as osteoarthritis; in bone resorptive disease (such as osteoporosis and Paget's disease); in diseases associated with aberrant angiogenesis; the enhanced collagen remodelling associated with diabetes, periodontal disease (such as gingivitis), corneal ulceration, ulceration of the skin, post-operative conditions (such as colonic anastomosis) and dermal wound healing; demyelinating diseases of the central and peripheral nervous systems (such as multiple sclerosis); Alzheimer's disease; extracellular matrix remodelling observed in cardiovascular diseases such as restenosis and atheroscelerosis; asthma; rhinitis; and chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (COPD).<br>
MMP12, also known as macrophage elastase or metalloelastase, was initially cloned in the mouse by Shapiro et al (1992, Journal of Biological Chemistry 267: 4664) and in man by the same group in 1995. MMP-12 is preferentially expressed in activated macrophages, and has been shown to be secreted from alveolar macrophages from smokers (Shapiro et al, 1993, Journal of Biological Chemistry, 268: 23824) as well as in foam cells in atherosclerotic lesions (Matsumoto et al, 1998, Am J Pathol 153: 109). A mouse model of COPD is based on challenge of mice with cigarette smoke for six months, two cigarettes a day six days a week. Wildtype mice developed pulmonary emphysema after this treatment. When MMP12 knock-out mice were tested in this model they developed no significant emphysema, strongly indicating that MMP-12 is a key enzyme in the COPD pathogenesis. The role of MMPs such as MMP12 in COPD (emphysema and bronchitis) is discussed in Anderson and Shinagawa, 1999, Current Opinion in Anti-inflammatory and Immunomodulatory Investigational Drugs 1(1): 29-38. It was recently discovered that smoking increases macrophage infiltration and macrophage-derived MMP-12 expression<br><br>
in human carotid artery plaques Kangavari (Matetzky S, Fishbein MC et al, Circulation 102:fl8). 36-39 Suppl. S5 Oct 31, 2000).<br>
MMP13, or collagenase 3, was initially cloned from a cDNA library derived from a breast tumour [J. M. P. Freije et al (1994) Journal of Biorogical Chemistry 269C24): 16766-16773]. PCR-RNA analysis of RNAs from a wide range of tissues indicated that MMP13 expression was limited to breast carcinomas as it was not found in breast fibroadenomas, normal or resting mammary gland, placenta, liver, ovary, uterus, prostate or parotid gland or in breast cancer cell lines (T47-D, MCF-7 and ZR75-1). Subsequent to this observation MMP13 has been detected in transformed epidermal keratinocytes [N. Johansson et al., (1997) Cell Growth Differ. 8Â£2):243-250], squamous cell carcinomas [N. Johansson et al, (1997) Am. J. Pathol. 151(2^:499-508] and epidermal tumours [K. Airola et al, (1997) J. Invest. Dermatol. 109(2):225-231]. These results are suggestive that MMP13 is secreted by transformed epithelial cells and may be involved in the extracellular matrix degradation and cell-matrix interaction associated with metastasis especially as observed in invasive breast cancer lesions and in malignant epithelia growth in skin carcinogenesis.<br>
Recent published data implies that MMP13 plays a role in the turnover of other connective tissues. For instance, consistent with MMP13's substrate specificity and preference for degrading type II collagen [P. G. Mitchell et al, (1996) J. Clin. Invest. 97f3):761-768: V. Knauper et al., (1996) The Biochemical Journal 271:1544-15501, MMP13 has been hypothesised to serve a role during primary ossification and skeletal remodelling [M. Stahle-Backdahl et al, (1997) Lab. Invest. 76(5):717-728; N. Johansson et al, (1997) Dey. Dyn. 208(3}:3 87-397], in destructive joint diseases such as rheumatoid and osteo-arthritis [D. Wernicke et al, (1996) J. Rheumatol. 23:590-595; P. G. Mitchell et al, (1996) J. Clin. Invest. 97(3):761-768; O. Lindy et al, (1997) Arthritis Rheum 40('8):1391-1399]; and during the aseptic loosening of hip replacements [S. Imai et al, (1998) J. Bone Joint Surg. Br. 80(4):701-710]. MMP13 has also been implicated in chronic adult periodontitis as it has been localised to the epithelium of chronically inflamed mucosa human gingival tissue [V. J. Uitto et al, (1998) Am. J. Pathol<br><br>
152(6): 1489-1499] and in remodelling of the collagenous matrix in chronic wounds [M. Vaalamo et al, (1991)1. Invest Dermatol. 109fl):96-101].<br>
MMP9 (Gelatinase B; 92kDa TypelV Collagenase; 92kDa Gelatinase) is a secreted protein which was first purified, then cloned and sequenced, in 1989 [S.M. Wilhelm et al (1989) J. Biol Chem. 264 (29): 17213-17221; published erratum in J. Biol Chem. (1990) 265 (36): 22570].   A recent review of MMP9 provides an excellent source for detailed information and references on this protease: T.H. Vu &amp; Z. Werb (1998) (In : Matrix Metalloproteinases. 1998. Edited by W.'C. Parks &amp; R.P. Mecham. ppl 15 -148. Academic Press. ISBN 0-12-545090-7). The following points are drawn from that review by T.H. Vu &amp; Z. Werb (1998).<br>
The expression of MMP9 is restricted normally to a few cell types, including trophoblasts, osteoclasts, neutrophils and macrophages. However, it's expression can be induced in these same cells and in other cell types by several mediators, including exposure of the cells to growth factors or cytokines. These are the same mediators often implicated in initiating an inflammatory response. As with other secreted MMPs, MMP9 is released as an inactive Pro-enzyme which is subsequently cleaved to form the enzymatically active enzyme. The proteases required for this activation in vivo are not known. The balance of active MMP9 versus inactive enzyme is further regulated in vivo by interaction with TIMP-1 (Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinases -1), a naturally-occurring protein. TIMP-I binds to the C-terminal region of MMP9, leading to inhibition of the catalytic domain of MMP9. The balance of induced expression of ProMMP9, cleavage of Pro- to active MMP9 and the presence of TIMP-1 combine to determine the amount of catalytically active MMP9 which is present at a local site. Proteolytically active MMP9 attacks substrates which include gelatin, elastin, and native Type IV and Type V collagens; it has no activity against native Type I collagen, proteoglycans or laminins.<br>
There has been a growing body of data implicating roles for MMP9 in various physiological and pathological processes. Physiological roles include the invasion of embryonic trophoblasts through the uterine epithelium in the early stages of embryonic<br><br>
implantation; some role in the growth and development of bones; and migration of inflammatory cells from the vasculature into tissues.<br>
MMP-9 release, measured using enzyme immunoassay, was significantly enhanced in fluids and in AM supernatants from untreated asthmatics compared with those from other populations [Am. J. Resp. Cell &amp; Mol. Biol., (Nov 1997) 17(D:583-591"1. Also, increased MMP9 expression has been observed in certain other pathological conditions, thereby implicating MMP9 in disease processes such as COPD, arthritis, tumour metastasis, Alzheimer's, Multiple Sclerosis, and plaque rupture in atherosclerosis leading to acute coronary conditions such as Myocardial Infarction.<br>
MMP-8 (collagenase-2, neutrophil collagenase) is.a 53 kD enzyme of the.matrix metalloproteinase family that is preferentially expressed in neutrophils. Later studies indicate MMP-8 is expressed also in other cells, such as osteoarthritic chondrocytes [Shlopov et al, (1997) Arthritis Rheum, 40:2065]. MMPs produced by neutrophils can cause tissue remodelling, and hence blocking MMP-8 should have a positive effect in fibrotic diseases of for instance the lung, and in degradative diseases like pulmonary emphysema. MMP-8 was also found to be up-regulated in osteoarthritis, indicating that blocking MMP-8 may also be beneficial in this disease.<br>
MMP-3 (stromelysin-1) is a 53 kD enzyme of the matrix metalloproteinase enzyme family. MMP-3 activity has been demonstrated in fibroblasts isolated from inflamed gingiva [Uitto V. J. et al, (1981) J. Periodontal Res., 16:417-424], and enzyme levels have been correlated to the severity of gum disease [Overall C. M. et al, (1987) J. Periodontal Res., 22:81-88]. MMP-3 is also produced by basal keratinocytes in a variety of chronic ulcers [Saarialho-Kere U. K. et al, (1994) J. Clin. Invest, 94:79-88]. MMP-3 mRNA and protein were detected in basal keratinocytes adjacent to but distal from the wound edge in what probably represents the sites of proliferating epidermis. MMP-3 may thus prevent the epidermis from healing. Several investigators have demonstrated consistent elevation of MMP-3 in synovial fluids from rheumatoid and osteoarthritis patients as compared to controls [Waiakovits L. A. et al, (1992) Arthritis Rheum., 35:35-42; Zafarullah M. et al, (1993) J. Rheumatol., 20:693-697]. These studies provided the basis for the belief that an<br><br>
inhibitor of MMP-3 will treat diseases involving disruption of extracellular matrix resulting in inflammation due to lymphocytic infiltration, or loss of structural integrity necessary for organ function.<br>
A number of rnetailoproteinase inhibitors are known (see for example the review of MMP inhibitors by Beckett R.P. and Whittaker M., 1998, Exp. Opin. Ther. Patents, 8(3):259-282). Different classes of compounds may have different degrees of potency and selectivity for inhibiting various metalloproteinases.<br>
Whittaker M. et al (1999, Chemical Reviews 99(9):2735-2776) review a wide range of known MMP inhibitor compounds. They state that an effective MMP inhibitor requires a zinc binding group or ZBG (functional group capable of chelating the active site zinc(IT) ion), at least one functional group which provides a hydrogen bond interaction with the enzyme backbone, and one or more side chains which undergo effective van der Waals interactions with the enzyme subsites. Zinc binding groups in known MMP inhibitors include carboxyiic acid groups, hydroxamic acid groups, sulfhydryl or mercapto, etc. For example, Whittaker M. et al discuss the following MMP inhibitors:<br><br>
The above compound entered clinical development. It has a mercaptoacyl zinc binding group, a trimethylhydantoinylethyl group at the P1 position and a leucinyl-tert butyllglycinyl backbone.<br><br><br>
The above compound has a mercaptoacyl zinc binding group and an imide group at the PI position.<br><br>
The above compound was developed for the treatment of arthritis. It has a non-peptidic succinyl hydroxamate zinc binding group and a trimethylhydantomylethyl group at the PI position.<br><br>
The above compound is a phthalimido derivative that inhibits collagenases. It has a non-peptidic succinyl hydroxamate zinc binding group and a cyclic imide group at PI. Whittaker M. et al also discuss other MMP inhibitors having a PI cyclic imido group and various zinc binding groups (succinyl hydroxamate, carboxylic acid, thiol group, phosphorous-based group).<br><br><br>
N=0<br><br>
The above compounds appear to be good inhibitors of MMP8 and MMP9 (PCT patent applications W09858925, W09858915). They have apyrimidin-2,3,4-trione zinc binding group.<br>
The following compounds are not known as MMP inhibitors:<br>

(a) A compound of the invention may be converted to a salt, especially a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, or vice versa, by known methods; a salt, especially a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, of a compound of the invention may be converted into a different salt, especially a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, by known methods.<br><br>
(b) Compounds of the invention in which Z- 0 and R4= H may be prepared by reacting a compound of the formula IIa with a compound of the formula IIIa or a suitably protected form of a compound of formula IIIa (as shown in Scheme 1), and optionally thereafter forming a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or in vivo hydrolysable ester thereof:<br>
Scheme 1<br><br><br>
Aldehydes or ketones of formula Ha and compounds of formula IIIa in a suitable solvent are treated with a base, preferably in the temperature range from ambient temperature to reflux. Preferred base-solvent combinations include aliphatic amines such as trimethylamine, pyrrolidine or piperidine in solvents such as methanol, ethanol, tetrahydrofurane, acetonitrile or dimethylformamide, with addition of water when necessary to dissolve the reagents (Phillips, AP and Murphy, JG, 1951, J. Org. Chem. 16); or lithiumhexamethyldisilazan in tetrahydrofurane (Mio, S et al, 1991, Tetrahedron 47:2121-2132); or barium hydroxide octahydrate in isopropanol-water (Ajinomoto KK, 1993, Japanese Patent Number 05097814).<br>
Preferably, when preparing compounds of the invention by this process, R3, R5 or R6 will not contain additional functionalities such as aldehydes, ketones, halogenated radicals or any other radicals well known to those skilled in the art which have the potential of interfering with, competing with or inhibiting the bond formation reaction.<br>
It will be appreciated that many of the relevant starting materials are commercially or otherwise available or may be synthesised by known methods or may be found in the scientific literature.<br>
To prepare compounds of the general formula IIIa (R6 as hereinbefore described), compounds of formula IIIa in which R6 is H may be reacted with an appropriate aldehyde<br><br>
or ketone followed by dehydration and subsequent reduction of the resulting double bond by methods which are well know to those skilled in the art.<br>
(c) Compounds of the the invention in which Z = 0, R4 = H and X= N or NRl, especially specific stereoisomers thereof, may also be prepared as described for two of the four possible stereoisomers in Schemes 2 and 3 below.<br><br><br>
Starting from the propenoate derivatives of formula TV, via the diols VIa or VIb by either asymmetric epoxidation followed by regioselective opening with water, or asymmetric dihydroxylation. Depending on the chiral auxiliary in the epoxidation or     dihydroxylation, either the shown stereoisomers or their enantiomers of the diols of formula Via or VTb can be obtained. (For example, Ogino, Y. et al, 1991, Tetrahedron Lett. 32_(41):5761-5764; Jacobsen, E. N. etal, 1994, Tetrahedron, 50(15):4323-4334; Song, C. E. et al, 1997, Tetrahedron Asymmetry, 8 (6):841-844). Treatment with organic base and thionyl chloride and subsequent ruthenium tetroxide catalysed oxidation yields the cyclic sulfates VIIa and VIIb.<br>
The cyclic sulfates of formula VIIa and VIIb are conyerted to the hydroxy azides (Scheme 3) of fonnula Villa and VTIIb by treatment with sodium azide in dimethylformamide followed by careful hydrolysis of the hemisulfate intermediates before aqueous work-up. (Gao, Sharpless, 1988, J.Am.Chem.Soc, 110:7538; Kim, Sharpless, 1989, Tetrahedron Lett., 30:655). The hydroxy azides of formula VIIIa and VIIIb are hydrolysed and reduced to the (3-hydroxy-a-amino acids (not shown in Scheme 3), preferably hydrolysis with LiOH in THF followed by reduction with hydrogen sulfide, magnesium in methanol or organic phosphines by the Staudinger procedure. The p-hydroxy-q -amino acids in turn yield compounds of formula la upon treatment with cyanate and acid in aqueous media.<br><br>
(d) Compounds of the invention in which Z =0 and R4 is not H, especially specific stereoisomers thereof, may also be prepared as described for two of the four possible stereoisomers in Schemes 2 and 3. The compounds may be prepared by reacting the epoxides of formula V in Scheme 2 with an alcohol of formula R4-OH, yielding the alcohols Via. Subsequent conversion to the azides with phosphoazidate (Thompson, A. S. et al, 1993, J. Org. Chem. 58(22):5886-58S8) yields the ether analogs of the azido esters Villa in Scheme 3, which can be carried through to the final products as described under process (c). The radical R4 in alcohols R4-OH and the radicals R3, R5 and R6 in may be suitably protected. The protecting groups can be removed as a last step after the conversion      to the hydantoins of formula la.<br><br>
(e) Compounds of the invention in which. Z is S or NR2 and Yl and/or Y2 is 0, especially specific stereoisomers thereof, may also be prepared as described for two of the four possible stereoisomers in Schemes 2 and 3. The compounds may be synthesised by opening of the epoxides of formula V (Scheme2) with thiols R4-SH or amines R4-NH2 and thereafter subjected to analogous transformations as described for the alcohols VTCTa and VEHb in Scheme 3. When amines of R4-NH2 are used, it may be necessary to N-protect the intermediate amino alcohols, especially when the radical R4 is a n-alkyl group.<br>
(f) Compounds of the invention in which X is S and Yl and/or Y2 is 0, especially specific stereoisomers thereof, may also be prepared as described for two of the four possible stereoisomers in Schemes 2 and 3. The compounds may be prepared by reacting the cyclic sulfates of formula VIIa or VIIb, or the cc-hydroxy esters of formula Via via their sulfonate esters, with thiourea and acid (1997, Japanese Patent number 09025273).<br>
The propenoate derivatives of formula IV are widely accessible, eg from aldehydes and phosphonium or phosphonate derivatives of acetic acid via the Wittig or Horner-Emmons reaction (for example, van Heerden, P. S. et al, 1997, J. Chem. Soc, Perkin Trans. I(8):141-l 146).<br>
(g) Compounds of the invention in which X=NR1 and R1=H may be prepared from reacting an appropriate substituted aldehyde or ketone of formula lid with ammonium carbonate and potassium cyanide in aqueous alcohols at 50-100Â°C in a sealed vessel for 4-24h.    .<br><br>

(h) Compounds of the invention may also be synthesized according to Scheme 4 below. Suitable target compounds include the substituted 5-(biphenyl-4-yl-hydroxy-methyl)-imidazolidie-2,4-dione series and the substituted 5-[4-phenoxy-phenyl]-hydroxy-methyl -imidazolidine-2,4-dione series described in Example 8.<br>

amino acids (Method A), and the aldehydes prepared through a Suzuki coupling (Method B) in a conventional manner.   Method C also produces compounds L and 2. which may be utilized for further transformations, a Suzuki coupling (Method D) and amide coupling (Method E).<br>
The aldol condensation gives a diastereomeric mixture. The racemates are isolated by chromatography or in some cases by crystallization. The enantiomeres may be resolved by chiral chromatography.<br>

The compounds of the invention may be evaluated for example in the following assays:<br>
Isolated Enzyme Assays<br>
Matrix Metalloproteinase family including for example MMP12, MMP13.<br>
Recombinant human MMP12 catalytic domain may be expressed and purified as described by Parkar A.A. et al, (2000), Protein Expression and Purification, 20:152. The purified enzyme can be used to monitor inhibitors of activity as follows: MMP12 (50 ng/ml final concentration) is incubated for 30 minutes at RT in assay buffer (0.1M Tris-HC1, pH 7.3 containing 0.1M NaCI, 20mM CaCl2, 0.040;mM ZnCl and 0.05% (w/v) Brij 35) using the synthetic substrate Mac-Pro-Cha-Gly-Nva-His-Ala-Dpa-NH2 in the presence or absence of inhibitors. Activity is determined by measuring the fluorescence at Xex 328nm and Xem 393nm. Percent inhibition is calculated as follows: % Inhibition is equal to the [Fluorescence, - Fluorescence 1 divided by the [Fluorescence<br><br>
-Fluorescence ].<br>
Recombinant human proMMP13 may be expressed and purified as described by Knauper et al. [V. Knauper et al, (1996) The Biochemical Journal 271:1544-1550 (1996)]. The purified enzyme can be used to monitor inhibitors of activity as follows: purified proMMP13 is activated using lmM amino phenyl mercuric acid (APMA), 20 hours at 21 Â°C; the activated MMP13 (11.25ng per assay) is incubated for 4-5 hours at 35Â°C in assay buffer (0.1M Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 containing 0.1M NaCI, 20mM CaC12,0.02 mM ZnCl and 0.05% (w/v) Brij 35) using the synthetic substrate 7-methoxycoumarin-4-yI)acetyl.ProXeu.GIy.Leu.N-3-(2,4-dlnitrophenyl)-L-2,3-diaminopropionyl.Ala.Arg.NH2 in the presence or absence of inhibitors. Activity is determined by measuring the fluorescence at Xex 328nm and Î»em 393nm. Percent inhibition is calculated as follows: %<br><br>
Inhibition is equal to the [Fluorescence - Fluorescence ] divided by the<br>
[Fluorescence - Fluorescence A similar protocol can be used for other expressed and purified pro MMPs using substrates and buffers conditions optimal for the particular MMP, for instance as described in C Graham Knight et at., (1992) FEBS Lett. 296(3):263-266.<br>
Adamalysin family including for example TNF convertase<br>
The ability of the compounds to inhibit proTNFa convertase enzyme may be assessed using a partially purified, isolated en2yme assay, the enzyme being obtained from the membranes of THP-1 as described by K. M. Mohler et ah, (1994) Nature 370:218-220. The purified enzyme activity and inhibition thereof is determined by incubating the partially purified enzyme in the presence or absence of test compounds using the substrate 4',5'-Dimethoxy-fluoresceinyl Ser.Pro.Leu.Ala.Gln.Ala.Val.Arg.Ser.Ser.Ser.Arg.Cys(4-(3-succinimid-l-yl)-fluorescein)-NH2 in assay buffer (50mM Tris HC1, pH 7.4 containing 0.1% (w/v) Triton X-100 and 2mM CaCl2), at 26DC for 18 hours. The amount of inhibition is determined as for MMP 13 except lex 490nra and Î»em 530nm were used. The substrate was synthesised as follows. The peptidic part of the substrate was assembled on Fmoc-NH-Rink-MBHA-polystyrene resin either manually or on an automated peptide synthesiser by standard methods involving the use of Fmoc-arnino acids and O-benzotriazol-1-yl-N,N,N',N'-tetramethyluromum hexafiuorophosphate (HBTU) as coupling agent with at least a 4- or 5-fold excess of Fmoc-arnino acid and HBTU. Ser1 and Pro2 were double-coupled. The following side chain protection strategy was employed; Ser1(But), Gln5(Trityi), Arg8,,I2(Pmc or Pbf), Ser9-10,11(Trityl), Cysls(Trityl). Following assembly, the N-terminal Fmoc-protecting group was removed by treating the Fmoc-peptidyl-resin with in DMF. The amino-peptidyl-resin so obtained was acylated by treatment for 1.5-2hr at 70Â°C with 1.5-2 equivalents of 4';5'-dimethoxy-fluorescein-4(5)-carboxyHc acid [Kharma &amp; Ullman, (1980) Anal Biochem. 108:156-161) which had been preactivated with diisopropylcarbodiirnide and 1-hydroxybenzotriazole in DMF]. The dimethoxyfluoresceinyl-peptide was then simultaneously deprotected and cleaved from the<br><br><br>
resin by treatment with trifluoroacetic acid containing 5% each of water and triethylsilane. The dimethoxyfluoresceinyl-peptide was isolated by evaporation, trituration with diethyl ether and filtration. The isolated peptide was reacted with 4-(N-maleirnido)-fluorescein in DMF containing diisopropylethylarnine, the product purified by RP-HPLC and finally isolated by freeze-drying from aqueous acetic acid. The product was characterised by MALDI-TOF MS and amino acid analysis.<br>

Arner et al., (1998) Osteoarthritis and Cartilage 6:214-228; (1999) Journal of Biological Chemistry, 274 (lO), 6594-6601 and the antibodies described therein. The potency of compounds to act as inhibitors against collagenases can be determined as described by T. Cawston and A. Barrett (1979) Anal. Biochem. 99:340-345.<br>

47:3239-3245.<br><br>
Test as an agent to inhibit whole blood TNT sheddase activity<br>
The ability of the compounds of this invention to inhibit TNFa production is assessed in a human whole blood assay where LPS is used to stimulate the release of TNFa. Heparinized (lOUnits/ml) human blood obtained from volunteers is diluted 1:5 with medium (RPMI1640 + bicarbonate, penicillin, streptomycin and glutamine) and incubated (160Î¼l) with 20Î¼l of test compound (triplicates), in DMSO or appropriate vehicle, for 30 min at 37Â°C in a humidified (5%C02/95%air) incubator, prior to addition of 20ul LPS (E. coli. 0111 :B4; final concentration 10Î¼.g/rnl). Each assay includes controls of diluted blood incubated with medium alone (6 wells/plate) or a known TNFa inhibitor as standard. The plates are then incubated for 6 hours at 37Â°C (humidified incubator), centrifuged (2000rpm for 10 min; 4Â°C), plasma harvested (50-1 OOui) and stored in 96 well plates at -70Â°C before subsequent analysis for TNFa concentration by ELISA.<br>
est as an agent to inhibit in vitro cartilage degradation<br>
The ability of the compounds of this invention to inhibit the degradation of the aggrecan or collagen components of cartilage can be assessed essentially as described by K. M. Bottomley et aL, (1997) Bibchem J. 323:483-488.<br>
Pharmacodynamic test<br>
To evaluate the clearance properties and bioavailability of the compounds of this invention an ex vivo pharmacodynamic test is employed which utilises the synthetic substrate assays above or alternatively HPLC or Mass spectrometric analysis. This is a generic test which can be used to estimate the clearance rate of compounds across a range of species. Animals (e,g. rats, marmosets) are dosed iv or po with a soluble formulation of compound (such as 20% w/v DMSO, 60% w/v PEG400) and at subsequent time points (e.g. 5,15, 30, 60, 120, 240, 480, 720, 1220 mins) the blood samples are taken from an appropriate vessel into 10U heparin. Plasma fractions are obtained following centrifugation and the plasma proteins precipitated with acetonitrile (80% w/v final concentration). After 30 mins at -20Â°C the plasma proteins are sedimented by centrifugation and the supernatant fraction is evaporated to dryness using a Savant speed vac. The sediment is reconstituted in<br><br>
assay buffer and subsequently analysed for compound content using the synthetic substrate assay. Briefly, a compound concentration-response curve is constructed for the compound undergoing evaluation. Serial dilutions of the reconstituted plasma extracts are assessed for activity and the amount of compound present in the original plasma sample is calculated using the concentration-response curve taking into account the total plasma dilution factor.<br>
In vivo assessment<br>
Test as an anti-TNF agent<br>
The ability of the compounds of this invention as ex vivo TNFa inhibitors is assessed in the rat. Briefly, groups of male Wistar Alderley Park (AP) rats (180-210g) are dosed with compound (6 rats) or drug vehicle (10 rats) by the appropriate route e.g. peroral (p.o.), intraperitoneal (Lp.), subcutaneous (s.c). Ninety minutes later rats are sacrificed<br>
using a rising concentration of CO2 and bled out via the posterior vena cavae into 5 Units of sodium heparin/ml blood. Blood samples are immediately placed on ice and centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 10 min at 4Â°C and the harvested plasmas frozen at -20Â° C for subsequent assay of their effect on TNFa production by LPS-stirnulated human blood. The rat plasma samples are thawed and 175u,l of each sample are added to a set format pattern in a 96U well plate. Fifty u.1 of heparinized human blood is then added to each well, mixed and the plate is incubated for 30 min at 37Â°C (humidified incubator). LPS (25ul; final concentration lOp-g/ml) is added to the wells and incubation continued for a further 5.5 hours. Control wells are incubated with 25ul of medium alone. Plates are then centrifuged for 10 min at 2000 rpm and 200\Î¼l of the supematants are transferred to a 96 well plate and frozen at -20Â° C for subsequent analysis of TNF concentration by ELISA.<br>

Test as an anti-emphysema agent<br>
Activity of a compound as an anti-emphysema agent may be assessed essentially as described in Hautamaki et al (1997) Science, 277: 2002.<br>
The invention will now be illustrated but not limited by the following Examples:<br>
General analytical methods: aH-NMR spectra were recorded on either a Varian unityInova 400MHz or Varian Mercury-VX 300MHz instrument. The central solvent peak of chloroform-Î± (5H 7.27 ppm), dirnethylsulfoxide-d6 (5H 2.50 ppm) or methanol-d4 (SH 3.31 ppm) were used as internal references. Low resolution mass spectra were obtained on a Agilent 1100 LC-MS system equipped with an APCI ionization chamber.<br>
If not stated otherwise commercially available starting materials or intermediates described in Table 2 and 3 where used.<br><br>
EXAMPLE 1 5-(Biphenyl-4-yl-hydroxy-methyl)-5-methyl-imidazolidine-2,4-dione<br><br>
0 4-Biphenylcarboxaldehyde (182 mg, 1.0 mmol) and trimethyiamine (45% in water, 160 jil, 1.0 mmol) was added to a warm solution of 5-methyl-imidazolidine-2,4-dione (114 mg, 1.0 mmol) in methanol (4.0 ml) and water (1.0 ml). The reaction was heated to reflux for 16 hours with nitrogen as inert atmosphere.<br>
The solution was cooled, evaporated and stirred in a 100/1 mixture of dichloromethane/methanol (15 ml). Filtration, washing of the precipitate with the same solvent mixture (10 ml), and drying by airsuction, afforded 5-(Biphenyl-4-yl-hydroxy-methyl)-irnidazolidine-2,4-dione (190 mg) in 64.1 % yield as a diasteromeric mixture of 60/40 according to HNMR.<br>
The isomeric mixture (180 mg) was dissolved in dioxane (8 ml) and water (4 ml). Preparative HPLC on a Chromasil CI 8 250/20 mm column (KR-100-5-C18), with a gradient of acetonitril/water (0.1 % trifluoroacetic acid), from 20/80 to 40/60 during 25 min, afforded the two isolated diasteromeres in 43.5 % total yield.<br>
A preliminary stereostructural determination was done for each isomer by comparing the HNMR with the two diastereomeres of 5-[(4-chloro-phenyl)-hydroxy-methyl)]-imidazoIidine-2,4-dione, of which both diasteromeric structures had been determined earlier by different NMR experiments in detail. The shift for the 1-NH proton and the phenyl attached to the imidazolelidione was especially indicative in this diastereomeric assignment.<br><br>

EXAMPLES<br>
   Compounds were synthesized according to Method C in Scheme 4 (shown in the description above).<br>
(a) Preparation of intermediate hydantoins (Method A in Scheme 4)<br>
According to Scheme 5 below, the hydantoins 5 were prepared in two steps from general amino acids 3 with isolation of the intermediates 4.<br>
Scheme 5 (Method A)<br><br>
Table 2 lists the intermediate hydantoins that were synthesized. The general method of preparation was as follows. A slurry of amino acid 3 (25 mmol) and potassium cyanate (5.1 g, 63 mmol) in water (75 ml) was heated at 80Â°C for approximately 1 hour. The clear solution was cooled to 0Â°C and acidified to approximately pH 1 with concentrated hydrochloric acid (aq). The resulting white precipitate 4 was heated at reflux for 0.5-1 hour and then cooled on ice. In some instances full conversion was not reached after 1 hour heating. In these cases the crude material was treated under the same protocol again. The white solid was filtered, washed with water, dried and analysed by HNMR and LCMS.<br><br>
