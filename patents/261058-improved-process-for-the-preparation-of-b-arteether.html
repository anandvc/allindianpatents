H,C<br><br>
OCHjCHa<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
A.Brossi, et.al, (Journal of medicinal chemistry, 1988, 31, 3,645-650), discloses a process for the preparation of arteether from artemesinin.This process yields a mixture of a: P isomers of areether in the ratio of 1:3.The acid catalyst used for the conversion of dihyroartemisinin to areether is BF3 - etherate in benzene. The ratio of benzene and ethanol used for the conversion is 11ml: 4 ml.<br>
An Indian patent IN 173947 (1990) discloses an improved process for the preparation of a mixture a and P arteether in the ratio of 1:3 using BF3 etherate as an acid catalyst in benzene under reflux wherein they used benzene and ethanol in the ratio of 7.5: 3.5<br>
Another Indian patent IN 180500 (1998) discloses an improved process for the preparation of a mixture of a: p arteether in the ratio of 1:3 using chlorotrimethyisilane as an acid catalyst in benzene ai room temperature.<br><br>
Since benzene is carcinogenic, all the above methods are not industrially viable,<br>
US patent 6346631 (2002), describes the process for the preparation of arteether using p-toluene sulphonic acid as an acid catalyst in presence of trialkylorthoformale at 40°C. This method also yields isomeric mixture of arteether.<br>
Another US patent 2004/0106809, discloses a process for the preparation of arteether from artemesinin in a single step using trimethyl silyl chloride or p-Toleuncsulphonic acid and polyhydroxy catalyst such as dextrose,galactose function of which is not clear.<br>
Therefore it is object of the present invention to provide a novel process for the preparation of isomericaily pure (3-isomer of arteether.<br>
Another object of the present invention to provide a industrially viable and economically suitable process for the preparation of pure p- arteether.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a selective process to produce p-arteether which is about 90%.<br>
Summary of invention<br>
Accordingly, the present invention a novel process for the preparation of p-arteether comprising; converting artemesinin to dihydroartemesinin using sodium borohydride in methanol between -5'^C to lO^C; acetalization of dihydroartemesimn using ethanol and Iriethyiortho formate at the temperature between 15 to 40°C; treating dihydroartemesinin with acid catalyst such as tartaric acid, acetic acid, citric acid, oxalic acid to produce arteeether; isolating pure p- isomer of arteether by recrystallisation using hexane, heptane, cyclohexane, pet ether.<br><br>
Another aspect of the present invention, the process provides a selective synthesis of (3-arteether in which formation of a-arteether is minimized and the proportion of the said p-arteether with respect to the a-arteether is 9 ■. 1.<br>
Yet another aspect of the present invention, a novel process for the production of 99.9% isomerically pure p-arteether,<br>

The present invention provides improved process for the preparation of arieether under reaction conditions that improve reaction yields and facilitate the process. In particular, the present invention is directed to the synthesis of p-arteether wherein the said process faciUtates 90% formation P-arteether and the proportion of the said P-arteether with respect to the a-arteether is 9:1 in the final product.<br>
Using organic acids as a catalyst to convert dihydroartemesinin into arteelher it is beheved that the process of the present invention is more efficient than those disclosed in prior art. It is further proved that the processes of the present invention produce arteether in high yields, for example about 85 to about 95%. Furthermore, formation of p-arteether in the reaction mixture during conversion with respect to the u-arteether is 9:1, which is about 90%.<br><br>
