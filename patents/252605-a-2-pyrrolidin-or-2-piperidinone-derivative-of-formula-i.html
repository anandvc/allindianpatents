				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The metabolic syndrome is a disease with increasing prevalence not only in the Western world but also in Asia and developing countries. It is characterised by obesity in particular central or visceral obesity, type 2 diabetes, hyperlipidernia, hypertension, arteriosclerosis, coronary heart diseases and eventually chronic renal failure (C.T. Montague et al. (2000), Diabetes, 49,883-888).<br>
Glucocorticoids and 11ß-HSDl are known to be important factors in differentiation of adipose stromal cells into mature adipocytes. In the visceral stromal cells of obese patients, 11ß-HSD1 mRNA level is increased compared with subcutaneous tissue. Further, adipose tissue over-expression of 11ß-HSD1 in transgenic mice is associated with increased corticosterone levels in the adipose tissue, visceral obesity, insulin sensitivity, Type 2 diabetes, hyperlipidernia and hyperphagia (EL Masuzaki et al (2001), Science, 294,2166-2170). Therefore, 11ß-HSD1 is most likely be involved in the development of visceral obesity and the metabolic syndrome.<br>
Inhibition of 11ß-HSDl results in a decrease in differentiation and an increase in proliferation of adipose stromal cells. Moreover, glucocorticoid deficiency (adrenalectomy) enhances the ability of insulin and leptin to promote anorexia and weight loss, and this effect is reversed by glucocorticoid administration (P.M. Stewart et al (2002), Trends Endocrin. Metabol, 13,94-96). These data suggest that enhanced reactivation of cortisone by 11ß-HSD1 may exacerbate obesity and it may be beneficial to inhibit this enzyme in adipose tissue of obese patients. Obesity is also linked to cardiovascular risks. There is a significant relationship between Cortisol excretion rate and HDL cholesterol in both men and women, suggesting that glucocorticoids regulate key components of cardiovascular risk. In analogy, aortic stiffness is also associated with visceral adiposity in older adults.<br>
Glucocorticoids and glaucoma<br>
Glucocorticoids increase the risk of glaucoma by raising the intraocular pressure when administered exogenously and in certain conditions of increased production like in Cushing's syndrome. Corticosteroid-induced elevation of intra ocular pressure is caused by increased resistance to aqueous outflow due to glucocorticoid induced changes in the trabecular meshwork and its intracellular matrix. Zhou et al. (Int J Mol <br>
Mcd (1998) 1, 339-346) also reported that corticosteroids increase the amounts of fibronectin as well as collagen type I and type IV in the trabecular meshwork of organ-cultured bovine anterior segments.<br>
11P-HSD1 is expressed in the basal cells of the corneal epithelium and the non-pigmented epithelial cells. Glucocorticoid receptor mRNA was only detected in the trabecular meshwork, whereas in the non-pigmented epithelial cells mRNA for the glucocorticoid-, mineralocorticoid receptor and 1 1P-HSD1 was present. Carbenoxolone administration to patients resulted in a significant decrease in intra-ocular pressure (S. Rauz et al. (2001), Invest. Ophtalmol. Vis. Science, 42, 2037-2042), suggesting a role for HSD1-inhibitors in treating glaucoma.<br>
Accordingly, the underlying problem to be solved by the present invention was to identify potent 110-HSD inhibitors, with a high selectivity for 11JJ-HSD1, and the use thereof in treating pathologies associated with excess cortisol formation such as obesity, diabetes, obesity related cardiovascular diseases, and glaucoma, As shown hereinbelow, the 3-substituted 2-pyrrolidinone derivatives of formula (I) were found to be useful as a medicine, in particular in the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment of pathologies associated with excess cortisol formation.<br>
Blommaert A. et al. (Heterocycles (2001), 55(12), 2273-2278) provides the preparation of piperidine- and pyrrolidinone-like polymer supported (R)-phenylglycinol-derived scaffolds and in particular discloses 2-Pyrrolidinone, l-[(lR)-2-hydroxy-l-phenylethyl]-3-methyl-3-(phenylmethyl)- and 2-Pyrrolidinone, l-[(lR)-2-hydroxy-l-phenylethyl]-3-(phenylmethyl)-, (3R).<br>
Bausanne I. et al. (Tetrahedron: Assymetry (1998), 9(5), 797-804) provides the preparation of 3-substituted pyrrolidinones via (x-alkylation of a chiral non-racemic y-lacton and in particular discloses J-(2-hydroxy-l-phenylelhyl)-3-benzylpyrrolidin-2-one.<br>
US 2001/034343; US 6,211,199; US 6,194,406; WO 97/22604 and WO 97/19074 are a number of patent applications filed by Aventis Pharmaceuticals Inc. providing 4-(lH-benzimidazol-2-yl)[l,4]diazepanes useful for the treatment of allergic diseases. In these applications the 3-substituted pyrrolidinones of the present invention are disclosed as intermediates in the synthesis of said 4-(lH-benzimidazol-2-yl)[l,4]diazepanes. These applications in particular disclose; 2-Pyrrolidinone, 3-[(4-fluorophenyl)methyl]-l-[(lS)-l-phenylethyl]- and 2-Pyrrolidinone, 3-[(4-fluorophenyl)methyl]-l-[(lR)-l-phenylethyl]-.<br><br>
The general synthesis and absolute configuration of diastereomeric 3-substituted 1-(1'-(S)-phenylethyl]-2-pyrrolidinones is provided by Nikiforov T. T. and Simeonov E. E. in Doklady Bolgarskoi Academii Nauk (1986), 39(3), 73-76. It exemplifies the synthesis of 2-Pyrrolidinonc, 3-methyl-3-[(4-methylphenyl)methyl]-l-(l-phenylethyl)-[S-(R*, R*)]; 2-Pyrrolidinone, 3-methyl-3-[(4-methylphenyl)methyl]-l-(l-phenylethyl)-, [S-(R*. S*)]; 2-Pyrrolidinone, 3-[(4-methylphenyl)methyl]-l-(l-phenylethyl)-, [S-(R*. R*)] and 2-Pyrrolidinone, 3-[(4-methylphenyl)methyl]-l-(l-phenylethyl)-, [S-(R*, S*)].<br>

The 1,3-pyrrolidinine derivatives of the present invention are generally prepared by alkylation of the appropriate lactam (II) with an appropriate alky] halide (in) in the presence of a base such as for example (diisopropylamino)lithium (IDA) or sec-butyllithium, optionally in the present of a co-solvent such as for example N,N',N"-<br><br>
Hexamethylphosphoramide (HMPA) or a salt such as for example LiBr (Scheme 1). This reaction is usually performed in an inert solvent such as for example diisopropylether, tetrahydrofuran or methylene chloride. The reaction temperature and the reaction time may be altered depending on the starting material or reagents but is usually performed within a couple of hours at low temperatures (-50°C - -90°C). In some cases the coupling reaction is slow and the mixture has to be kept until completion. In these cases the temperature could be enhanced up to (-10°C - -30°C).<br>
Scheme 1<br>
(Figure Removed)<br><br><br>
The appropriate lactam of formula (II) hereinbefore, is generally prepared by reacting the known amines of formula (FV) with either 4-chlorobutanoyl chloride or 5-chloropentanoyl chloride in the presence of a base, such as for example sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, sodiumcarbonate or sodium hydrogen carbonate, in an appropriate solvent such as for example dichloromethane, diisopropylether, tetrahydrofuran or methylene chloride (Scheme 2). The reaction is typically performed in two steps, wherein, in a first step the 4-chlorobutanoyl chloride or 5-chloropentanoyl chloride is added to the amine of formula (IV) under basic conditions, using for example triethylamine in dichloromethane, to form the amide of formula (V). In the<br><br>
second step, upon addition of a strong base such as sodium hydroxide, an internal nucleophilic addition reaction provides the lactam of formula (II).<br>
gcheme 2<br>

(Table Remove) <br><br><br>
The amines of formula (IV) are generally prepared using art known techniques, see for instance in; "Introduction to organic chemistry" Streitweiser and Heathcock -Macmillan Publishing Co., Inc. - second edition - New York - Section 24.6 p 742-753, and comprise synthesis through indirect alkylation of the appropriate (hetero)aryl halides in particular by the Gabriel synthesis, through reduction of the corresponding nitro or nitrille compounds, through reductive amination using for example the Eschweiler-Clarke reaction and in particular fore those compounds of formula (I) wherein L represents an optionally substituted Ci-alkyl, through the reduction of oximes (VI) which may be prepared from aldehydes or ketones (VII) by reaction with hydroxylamine (scheme 3). In this latter case the oximes are reduced by lithium aluminium hydride or catalytic hydrogenation using an appropriate catalysator such as Raney Nickel, said reduction being performed in an inert anhydrous solvent such as ether or tetrahydrofuran (THF).<br><br>
Scheme 3<br><br>
(Figure Removed)<br><br>
Wherein R' represents a CMalkyl, C|.3alkyloxy-CMalkyl, hydroxy-CMalkyl, Ci_3alkyloxy- orphenyl-CMalkyl- and R6 is defined as for the compounds of formula (I).<br>
Further examples for the synthesis of compounds of formula (I) using anyone of the above mentioned synthesis methods, are provided in the experimental part hereinafter.<br>
Where necessary or desired, any one or more of the following further steps in any order<br>
may be performed :<br>
(i)   removing any remaining protecting group(s);<br>
(ii) converting a compound of formula (I) or a protected form thereof into a further<br>
compound of formula (I) or a protected form thereof; (iii) converting a compound of formula (I) or a protected form thereof into a W-oxide, a<br>
salt, a quaternary amine or a solvate of a compound of formula (I) or a protected<br>
form thereof; (iv) converting a N-oxide, a salt, a quaternary amine or a solvate of a compound of<br>
formula (I) or a protected form thereof into a compound of formula (I) or a<br>
protected form thereof; (v) converting a /V-oxide, a salt, a quaternary amine or a solvate of a compound of<br>
formula (I) or a protected form thereof into another W-oxide, a pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable addition salt a quaternary amine or a solvate of a compound of formula<br>
(I) or a protected form thereof; (vi) where the compound of formula (I) is obtained as a mixture of (R) and (S)<br>
enantiomers resolving the mixture to obtain the desired enantiomer;<br>
It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that in the processes described above the functional groups of intermediate compounds may need to be blocked by protecting groups.<br><br>
Functional groups which it is desirable to protect include hydroxy, amino and carboxylic acid. Suitable protecting groups for hydroxy include trialkylsilyl groups (e.g. tert-butyldimethylsilyl, tert-butyldiphenylsilyl or trimethylsilyl), benzyl and tetrahydropyranyl. Suitable protecting groups for amino include tert-butyloxycarbony 1 or benzyloxycarbonyl. Suitable protecting groups for carboxylic acid include Chalky! or benzyl esters.<br>
The protection and deprotection of functional groups may take place before or after a reaction step.<br>
The use of protecting groups is fully described in 'Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis' 2™1 edition, T W Greene &amp; P G M Wutz, Wiley Interscience (1991).<br>
Additionally, the N-atoms in compounds of formula (1) can be methylated by art-known methods using CHa-I in a suitable solvent such as, for example 2-propanone, letrahydrofuran or dimethylformamide.<br>
The compounds of formula (I), can also be converted into each other following art-known procedures of functional group transformation of which some examples are mentioned hereinabove.<br>
•K<br>
The compounds of formula (I), may also be converted to the corresponding TV-oxide forms following art-known procedures for converting a trivalent nitrogen into its W-oxide form. Said W-oxidation reaction may generally be carried out by reacting the starting material of formula (I) with 3-phenyl-2-(phenylsulfonyl)oxaziridine or with an appropriate organic or inorganic peroxide. Appropriate inorganic peroxides comprise, for example, hydrogen peroxide, alkali metal or earth alkaline metal peroxides, e.g. sodium peroxide, potassium peroxide; appropriate organic peroxides may comprise peroxy acids such as, for example, benzenecarboperoxoic acid or halo substituted benzenecarboperoxoic acid, e.g. 3-chlorobenzenecarboperoxoic acid, peroxoalkanoic acids, e.g. peroxoacetic acid, alkylhydroperoxides, e.g. t-butyl hydroperoxide. Suitable solvents are, for example, water, lower alkanols, e.g. ethano! and the like, hydrocarbons, e.g. toluene, ketones, e.g. 2-butanone, halogenated hydrocarbons, e.g. dichloromethane, and mixtures of such solvents.<br>
Pure stereochemically isomeric forms of the compounds of formula (I), may be obtained by the application of art-known procedures. Diastereomers may be separated<br><br>
by physical methods such as selective crystallization and chromatographic techniques, e.g. counter-current distribution, liquid chromatography and the like.<br>
Some of the compounds of formula (I), and some of the intermediates in the present invention may contain an asymmetric carbon atom. Pure stereochemically isomeric forms of said compounds and said intermediates can be obtained by the application of ait-known procedures. For example, diastereoisomers can be separated by physical methods such as selective crystallization or chromatographic techniques, e.g. counter current distribution, liquid chromatography and the like methods. Enamiomers can be obtained from racemic mixtures by first convening said racemic mixtures with suitable resolving agents such as, for example, chiral acids, to mixtures of diastereomeric salts or compounds; then physically separating said mixtures of diastereomeric salts or compounds by, for example, selective crystallization or cnromatographic techniques, e.g. liquid chromatography and the like methods; and finally converting said separated diastereomeric salts or compounds into the corresponding enantiomers. Pure stereochemically isomeric forms may also be obtained from the pure stereochemically isomeric forms of the appropriate intennediates and starting materials, provided that the intervening reactions occur stereospecifically.<br>
An alternative manner of separating the enantiomeric forms of the compounds of formula (I) and intermediates involves liquid chromatography, in particular liquid chromatography using a chiral stationary phase.<br>
Some of the intennediates and starting materials as used in the reaction procedures mentioned hereinabove are known compounds and may be commercially available or may be prepared according to art-known procedures.<br>
The compounds of the present invention are useful because they possess pharmacological properties. They can therefore be used as medicines, in particular to treat pathologies associated with excess cortisol formation such as for example, obesity, diabetes, obesity related cardiovascular diseases, and glaucoma.<br>
As described in the experimental part hereinafter, the inhibitory effect of the present compounds on the llp-HSDl-reductase activity (conversion of cortison into cortisol) has been demonstrated in vitro, in an enzymatic assay using the recombinant Ub-HSD1 enzyme, by measuring the conversion of cortison into cortisol using HPLC purification and quantification methods. 1 lp-HSDl-reductase inhibition was also demonstrated in vitro, in a cell based assay comprising contacting the cells, expressing<br><br>
11P-HSD1 with the compounds to be tested and assessing the effect of said compounds on the formation of cortisol in the cellular medium of these cells. The cells preferably used in an assay of the present invention are selected from the group consisting of mouse fibroblast 3T3-L1 cells, HepG2 cells, pig kidney cell, in particular LCC-PK1 cells and rat hepatocytes.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides the compounds of formula (I) and their pharmaceutically acceptable JV-oxides, addition salts, quaternary amines and stereochemically isomeric forms for use in therapy. More particular in the treatment or prevention of parthologies associated with excess cortisol formation such as obesity, diabetes, obesity related cardiovascular diseases and glaucoma. The compounds of formula (I) and their pharmaceutically acceptable JV-oxides, addition salts, quaternary amines and the stereochemically isomeric forms may hereinafter be referred to as compounds according to the invention.<br>
In view of the utility of the compounds according to the invention, there is provided a method for the treatment of an animal, for example, a mammal including humans, suffering from a pathology associated with excess cortisol formation, which comprises administering an effective amount of a compound according to the present invention. Said method comprising the systemic or topical administration of an effective amount of a compound according to the invention, to warm-blooded animals, including humans.<br>
It is thus an object of the present invention to provide a compound according to the present invention for use as a medicine. In particular to use the compound according to the present invention in the manufacture of a medicament for treating pathologies associated with excess cortisol formation such as for example, obesity, diabetes, obesity related cardiovascular diseases, and glaucoma.<br>
The amount of a compound according to the present invention, also referred to here as the active ingredient, which is required to achieve a therapeutical effect will be, of course, vary with the particular compound, the route of administration, the age and condition of the recipient, and the particular disorder or disease being treated. A suitable daily dose would be from 0.001 mg/kg to 500 mg/kg body weight, in particular from 0,005 mg/kg to 100 mg/kg body weight. A method of treatment may also include administering the active ingredient on a regimen of between one and four intakes per day.<br><br>
While it is possible for the active ingredient to be administered alone, it is preferable to present it as a pharmaceutical composition. Accordingly, the present invention further provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound according to the present invention, together with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent. The carrier or diluent must be "acceptable" in the sense of being compatible with the other ingredients of the composition and not deleterious to the recipients thereof.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions of this invention may be prepared by any methods well known in the art of pharmacy, for example, using methods such as those described in Gennaro et al. Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences (IS* ed., Mack Publishing Company, 1990, see especially Part 8 : Pharmaceutical preparations and their Manufacture). A therapeutically effective amount of the particular compound, in base form or addition salt form, as the active ingredient is combined in intimate admixture with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, which may take a wide variety of forms depending on the form of preparation desired for administration. These pharmaceutical compositions are desirably in unitary dosage form suitable, preferably, for systemic administration such as oral, percutaneous, or parenteral administration; or topical administration such as via inhalation, a nose spray, eye drops or via a cream, gel, shampoo or the like. For example, in preparing the compositions in oral dosage form, any of the usual pharmaceutical media may be employed, such as, for example, water, glycols, oils, alcohols and the like in the case of oral liquid preparations such as suspensions, syrups, elixirs and solutions: or solid carriers such as starches, sugars, kaolin, lubricants, binders, disintegrating agents and the like in the case of powders, pills, capsules and tablets. Because of their ease in administration, tablets and capsules represent the most advantageous oral dosage unit form, in which case solid pharmaceutical carriers are obviously employed. For parenteral compositions, the carrier will usually comprise sterile water, at least in large part, though other ingredients, for example, to aid solubility, may be included. Injectable solutions, for example, may be prepared in which the carrier comprises saline solution, glucose solution or a mixture of saline and glucose solution. Injectable suspensions may also be prepared in which case appropriate liquid carriers, suspending agents and the like may be employed. In the compositions suitable for percutaneous administration, the carrier optionally comprises a penetration enhancing agent and/or a suitable wettable agent, optionally combined with suitable additives of any nature in minor proportions, which additives do not cause any significant deleterious effects on the skin. Said additives may facilitate the administration to the skin and/or may be helpful for preparing the desired compositions. These compositions may be administered in various ways, e.g., as a transdermal patch, as a spot-on or as an ointment. As appropriate compositions for topical application<br><br>
there may be cited all compositions usually employed for topically administering drugs e.g. creams, gellies, dressings, shampoos, tinctures, pastes, ointments, salves, powders and the like. Application of said compositions may be by aerosol, e.g. with a propellant such as nitrogen, carbon dioxide, a freon, or without a propellant such as a pump spray, drops, lotions, or a semisolid such as a thickened composition which can be applied by a swab. In particular, semisolid compositions such as salves, creams, gellies, ointments and the like will conveniently be used.<br>
It is especially advantageous to formulate the aforementioned pharmaceutical compositions in dosage unit form for ease of administration and uniformity of dosage. Dosage unit form as used in the specification and claims herein refers to physically discrete units suitable as unitary dosages, each unit containing a predetermined quantity of active ingredient calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect in association with the required pharmaceutical carrier. Examples of such dosage unit forms are tablets (including scored or coated tablets), capsules, pills, powder packets, wafers, injectable solutions or suspensions, teaspoonfuls, tablespoonfuls and the like, and segregated multiples thereof.<br>
In order to enhance the solubility and/or the stability of the compounds of formula (I) in pharmaceutical compositions, it can be advantageous to employ a-, P- or y-cyclo-dextrins or their derivatives. Also co-solvents such as alcohols may improve the solubility and/or the stability of the compounds of formula (I) in pharmaceutical compositions. In the preparation of aqueous compositions, addition salts of the subject compounds are obviously more suitable due to their increased water solubility.<br>
