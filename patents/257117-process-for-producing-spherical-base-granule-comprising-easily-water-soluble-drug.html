				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
PROCESS FOR PRODUCING SPHERICAL BASE GRANULE COMPRISING<br>
EASILY WATER-SOLUBLE DRUG<br>
Technical Field<br>
[0001]<br>
The present invention relates to a production process of spherical base<br>
granules comprising an easily water-soluble drug.<br>
Background Art<br>
[0002]<br>
Pharmaceutical solid preparations are sometimes coated with sustained<br>
release coating, enteric coating or bitter-taste masking coating with a view to<br>
reducing side-effects of the drug comprising in them, reducing the<br>
administration frequency, improving the effect of the drug, suppressing bitter<br>
taste, stabilizing the drug, or the like. Granules having a high sphericity are one<br>
of the dosage forms suited for film coating thereon. Such granules are called<br>
spherical base granules.<br>
[0003]<br>
As a production process of spherical base granules, a process of<br>
carrying out extrusion granulation using a drug and an excipient as raw<br>
materials and then spheronizing the resulting granules<br>
(extrusion/spheronization process), a process of coating the surface of spherical<br>
core particles with a drug (layering process) (refer to, for example, Patent<br>
Document 1 and Patent Document 2), and the like are known.<br>
[0004]<br>
In the layering process, granules are produced by spraying a layering<br>
liquid to spherical core particles to coat the spherical core particles with a<br>
coating layer. Specific examples of it include a process (power coating<br><br>
process) of simultaneously supplying a drug in powder form and an aqueous<br>
solution of a binder; and a process (layering-liquid spraying process) of<br>
supplying a suspension of drug particles or an aqueous solution of the drug.<br>
[0005]<br>
The layering process is suited as a process for producing spherical<br>
base granules, because spherical base granules having a high sphericity and a<br>
narrow particle size distribution can be obtained by using spherical core<br>
particles having a high sphericity and a narrow particle size distribution.<br>
Among the layering processes, the powder coating process has low<br>
flexibility with respect to coating conditions and has relative difficulty in stable<br>
and high-yield production of spherical base granules. The layering-liquid<br>
spraying process is, on the other hand, a superior layering process because of<br>
easy condition setting and high productivity. In particular, when the layering-<br>
liquid spraying process is applied to the production of spherical base granules<br>
comprising a drug having a medium level of water solubility, spherical base<br>
granules excellent in various physical properties can be obtained in a high<br>
production yield by using a suspension of the drug as the layering liquid.<br>
[0006]<br>
When the layering-liquid spraying process is applied to a production<br>
process of spherical base granules comprising a drug (easily water-soluble<br>
drug) having high water solubility, however, agglomeration of the spherical base<br>
granules is likely to occur. It is therefore necessary to reduce the concentration<br>
of the layering liquid or reduce the spray rate of the layering liquid.<br>
The reduction in the concentration or spray rate of the layering liquid<br>
causes problems such as surface roughening due to a reduction in a filling<br>
density of a drug-comprising layer and a reduction in the mechanical strength of<br>
the spherical base granules. In addition, it leads to prolongation of a layering<br>
time and causes a further problem such as reduction in the production efficiency<br>
of the spherical base granules.<br><br>
Under present circumstances, it is therefore very difficult to apply the<br>
layering process to the production of spherical base granules comprising an<br>
easily water-soluble drug.<br>
[0007]<br>
It is known to add various additives to the layering liquid for the<br>
purpose of preventing agglomeration, preventing separation of layered drug<br>
controlling a dissolution rate of the drug, or stabilization (refer to, for example,<br>
Patent Document 3 or Patent Document 4). These prior arts are not developed<br>
for preventing agglomeration when an easily water-soluble drug is used and<br>
therefore do not have a sufficient effect for preventing agglomeration when a<br>
easily water-soluble drug is used. Moreover, when an inorganic substance is<br>
added, continuous stirring of the layering liquid is required in order to prevent<br>
precipitation.<br>
Patent Document 1: Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. Sho 63-301816<br>
Patent Document 2: Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. Hei 7-53355<br>
Patent Document 3: Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. Hei 9-165329<br>
Patent Document 4: Published Japanese Translations of PCT International<br>
Patent Publication No. 2003-509439<br>
[0008]<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide a production process of<br>
spherical base granules comprising a drug in accordance with a layering<br>
process, which production process can produce spherical base granules having<br>
a smooth surface and therefore suited for film coating without causing<br>
agglomeration of the spherical base granules even when the drug is easily<br>
water soluble.<br>
Means for Solving the Problem<br><br>
[0009]<br>
The present inventors have carried out an extensive investigation with<br>
a view toward overcoming the above-described problem. As a result, it has<br>
been found that agglomeration of particles can be suppressed greatly by using<br>
specific spherical core particles and adding a low water-soluble saccharide to a<br>
layering liquid comprising an easily water-soluble drug, leading to the<br>
completion of the present invention.<br>
When a drug is easily water soluble, it is a common practice to<br>
overcome the problem of tackiness of the layering liquid by using a water<br>
insoluble additive. Unexpectedly, however, the tackiness of the layering liquid<br>
can be improved by the addition of a water soluble compound though its<br>
solubility is low.<br>
[0010]<br>
In the present invention, there is thus provided a process for producing<br>
spherical base granules comprising a easily water-soluble drug by spraying a<br>
layering liquid over pharmaceutically inert spherical core particles, thereby<br>
coating them with a layer comprising the drug, wherein:<br>
(1)	the spherical core particles have a microcrystalline cellulose<br>
content of 30 mass% or greater and a water absorbing capacity of 0.5 cm3/g or<br>
greater; and<br>
(2)	the layering liquid is an aqueous solution comprising at least the<br>
easily water-soluble drug and a low water-soluble saccharide.<br>
Advantage of the Invention<br>
[0011]<br>
The process according to the present invention enables efficient<br>
production of spherical base granules comprising an easily water-soluble drug<br>
with a smooth surface and high mechanical strength, because agglomeration of<br><br>
the spherical base granules can be prevented even without reducing the<br>
concentration or spray rate of the layering liquid.<br>
Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
[0012]<br>
The present invention will hereinafter be described specifically.<br>
First, the spherical core particles to be used in the invention are<br>
described.<br>
[0013]<br>
The term "spherical" as used herein means particles having a<br>
sphericity (= short diameter/long diameter) of 0.7 or greater. Particles which are<br>
not spherical are not preferred because they deteriorate the uniformity of film<br>
coating. The spherical particles have preferably a sphericity of 0.9 or greater.<br>
[0014]<br>
The spherical core particles have a microcrystalline cellulose content<br>
of 30 mass% or greater based on a total mass of the particles.<br>
When the microcrystalline cellulose content is less than 30 mass%, it<br>
is difficult to obtain spherical core particles and at the same time, the particles<br>
have reduced strength. The microcrystalline cellulose content is preferably 70<br>
mass% or greater, more preferably 100 mass%.<br>
The term "microcrystalline cellulose" as used herein means<br>
microcrystalline cellulose which conforms to the standard of "microcrystalline<br>
cellulose" specified in the Japanese Pharmacopoeia Fourteenth Edition.<br>
[0015]<br>
The spherical core particles are pharmaceutically inert, meaning that<br>
they do not comprise a drug.<br>
It should be noted that the term "drug" as used herein means what is<br>
used for treatment, prevention, or diagnosis of human or animal diseases but<br>
what is not an instrument/machine.<br><br>
[0016]<br>
The spherical core particles may comprise another pharmaceutical<br>
additive.<br>
Examples of the another pharmaceutical additive include excipients<br>
such as lactose, sucrose, D-mannitol, corn starch, powdered cellulose, calcium<br>
hydrogen phosphate, and calcium carbonate; disintegrants such as low-<br>
substituted hydroxypropyl cellulose, carmellose calcium, pregelatinized starch ,<br>
croscarmellose sodium, crospovidone, and carboxymethyl starch; binders such<br>
as hydroxypropyl cellulose, povidone (polyvinylpyrrolidone), and xanthan gum;<br>
coating agents such as hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose, methacrylic acid<br>
copolymer LD, and ethylcellulose aqueous dispersion; emulsifiers such as<br>
sucrose fatty acid ester, glycerin fatty acid ester, sodium lauryl sulfate, and<br>
polysorbate 60; and other additives such as talc, magnesium stearate,<br>
magnesium aluminometa silicate, titanium oxide, light silicic anhydride,<br>
microcrystalline cellulose and carboxymethylcellulose sodium.<br>
[0017]<br>
The spherical core particles have a water absorbing capacity of 0.5<br>
cm3/g or greater. The term "water absorbing capacity" as used herein means<br>
the volume of water which the spherical core particles can retain therein per unit<br>
mass and it is represented by the following equation:<br>
Water absorbing capacity G [cm3/g] = H/W<br>
H: volume [cm3/g] of water which spherical core particles can retain<br>
therein.<br>
W: mass [g] of the spherical core particles.<br>
Described specifically, it can be determined by adding 30 mL of<br>
purified water to 10 g of a sample (in terms of a dried sample), leaving the<br>
resulting mixture as is at room temperature for one hour, natural filtering out the<br>
solid through a filter paper, lightly wiping off water attached to the surface of the<br>
solid mass with another filter paper, measuring the mass of the solid, and<br><br>
dividing a difference calculated by subtracting 10 from the mass (water content)<br>
by 10.<br>
When the water absorbing capacity is smaller than 0.5 cm3/g, severe<br>
agglomeration of particles occurs during layering. The water absorbing capacity<br>
of 0.7 cm3/g or greater is preferred because it suppresses agglomeration<br>
effectively. The water absorbing capacity of 0.9 cm3/g or greater is more<br>
preferred.<br>
No limitation is imposed on the water absorbing capacity from the<br>
viewpoint of agglomeration. However the particles which have swelled with<br>
water absorbed therein shrink during drying step after they are coated with a<br>
drug-containing layer, leading to deterioration in the strength of the resulting<br>
spherical base granules. The preferred maximum water absorbing capacity of<br>
particles, which do not swell even after water absorption, is about 1.8 cm3/g.<br>
[0018]<br>
The spherical core particles have an average particle size of preferably<br>
from about 50 to 1000 urn. The particle size distribution is preferably sharp.<br>
The spherical core particles have a (tapped) bulk density of preferably<br>
from about 0.5 to 2.0 g/cm3, though it depends on the balance of strength and<br>
water absorbing capacity. The spherical core particles composed only of<br>
microcrystalline cellulose have a bulk density of preferably from about 0.5 to 1.0<br>
g/cm3.<br>
The mechanical strength of the spherical core particles is preferably<br>
higher.<br>
[0019]<br>
The layering liquid to be used in the present invention will hereinafter<br>
be described.<br>
The layering liquid comprises at least an easily water-soluble drug and<br>
a low water-soluble saccharide.<br><br>
The term "easily water-soluble drug" as used herein means a drug having a solubility of 1<br>
g or greater in 1 cm3 of water at 20°C.<br>
Conventionally, it was considerably difficult to adopt the layering process for<br>
producing spherical base granules with a high production yield when the easily water-<br>
soluble drug contained had a solubility of 1.5 g or greater. The present invention enables<br>
adoption of the layering process for the production of granules comprising such a easily<br>
water-soluble drug.<br>
[0020]<br>
Examples of the easily water-soluble drug to be used in the present invention include<br>
chlorpheniramine d-maleate, ethyl L-cysteine hydrochloride, chloperastine<br>
hydrochloride, fasudil hydrochloride, procainamide hydrochloride, ceftizoxime sodium,<br>
tradipine, migrenin, and loxoprofen sodium.<br>
[0021]<br>
The term "low water-soluble saccharide"as used herein means a saccharide having a<br>
solubility of 0.8 g or less in 1 cm3 of water at 20°C. Examples of it include<br>
monosaccharides, disaccharides, oligosaccharides, and sugar alcohols. Preferred are D-<br>
mannitol, maltose, and lactose. They may be used either singly or in combination. Of<br>
these, D-mannitol is especially preferred.<br>
[0022]<br>
The layering liquid has a content of the easily water-soluble drug of preferably from 5 to<br>
30 mass% based on the total mass of the layering liquid. The layering liquid has a content<br>
of the low water-soluble saccharide of preferably from 1 to 30 mass%, more preferably<br>
from 3 to 20 mass%, still more preferably from 4 to 10 mass%. Since the solubility of D-<br>
mannitol in 1 cm3 of water at 20°C is 0.18 g, when it is used as the low water-soluble<br>
saccharide, its content is preferably from 1 to 15 mass%, more preferably from 3 to 12<br>
mass%, especially preferably from 4 to 10 mass%.<br>
[0023]<br><br>
If necessary, the layering liquid may comprise another pharmaceutical<br>
additive. Addition of a binder is especially preferred because it contributes to<br>
improvement in the strength of a layer comprising the easily water-soluble drug.<br>
Examples of such a binder include hydroxypropyl cellulose, povidone, and<br>
hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose.<br>
[0024]<br>
The coating amount with the layer comprising the easily water-soluble<br>
drug can adequately be determined depending on the formulation design such<br>
as single dosage or size of the preparation. For example, the coating amount of<br>
the drug is generally from about 0.5 to 200 mass% based on the spherical core<br>
particles.<br>
[0025]<br>
The production process of the spherical base granules according to<br>
the present invention will hereinafter be described.<br>
A fluidized-bed coating apparatus can be used for coating the<br>
spherical core particles with the easily water-soluble drug containing layer.<br>
Examples of the fluidized bed coating apparatus include not only an ordinarily<br>
fluidized bed type but also, for example, a spouted bed type having, inside<br>
thereof, a guide tube (Wurster column) and a tumbling fluidized bed type<br>
equipped, on the bottom thereof, a rotation mechanism.<br>
Specific examples of such apparatuses include "Flow Coater" and<br>
"Spiral Flow", products of Freund Corporation, "WST/WSG Series" and "GPCC<br>
Series", products of Glatt GmbH, "New Marumerizer", product of Fuji Paudal<br>
Co., Ltd., and "Multiplex", product of Powrex Corporation.<br>
[0026]<br>
The layering liquid can be sprayed by a method suited for each of<br>
apparatuses such as top spray, bottom spray, side spray, and tangential spray.<br>
It may be sprayed to the spherical core particles continuously or intermittently.<br><br>
After completion of spraying, the spherical base granules are dried. Drying of the<br>
spherical based granules may be performed as are or after controlling the air flow or<br>
temperature as needed while not taking out the granules from the apparatus.<br>
[0027]<br>
The coating rate (spray rate of layering liquid) of the easily water-soluble drug layer is<br>
preferably 0.8 g/min or greater, in terms of an amount of a solid content of the layering<br>
liquid, per kg of the spherical core particles. Such a spray rate enables densification of the<br>
easily water-soluble drug containing layer and smoothing of the surface and as a result,<br>
spherical base granules suited for film coating can be obtained. In addition, such a spray<br>
rate enables a decrease in the layering time and improvement in the production<br>
efficiency.<br>
The coating rate is more preferably 1.0 g/min or greater, more preferably 1.3 g/min or<br>
greater.<br>
[0028]<br>
Next, one example of a production method of the spherical base granules will be<br>
described.<br>
(a)	Preparation of layering liquid: A layering liquid is prepared by adding a low<br>
water-soluble saccharide to water, thoroughly stirring the resulting mixture to dissolve<br>
the low water-soluble saccharide, adding an easily water-soluble drug and, if necessary, a<br>
pharmaceutical additive to the aqueous solution, and stir and dissolve (suspend) the<br>
resulting mixture sufficiently.<br>
(b)	Heating of spherical core particles and fluidized-bed coating apparatus: After<br>
spherical core particles are charged in a fluidized-bed coating apparatus, the core<br>
particles are caused to flow (when a fluidized-bed type coating apparatus with rotating<br>
equipment is employed, the rotating portion of it is turned simultaneously) by supplying<br>
hot air from the bottom portion of the apparatus until the outlet-air temperature reaches a<br>
predetermined temperature.<br><br>
(c)	Coating with drug containing layer: The layering liquid is sprayed at<br>
a predetermined spray rate continuously or intermittently or at a rate raised in a<br>
stepwise fashion. The supply of the layering liquid is terminated when the<br>
coating amount reaches a predetermined amount.<br>
(d)	Drying of spherical base granules: The spherical base granules are<br>
dried while adjusting the amount of hot air and temperature (rotation speed of<br>
the rotating portion when a tumbling fluidized bed type is employed) if<br>
necessary.<br>
(e)	Taking-out of spherical base granules: In the end, the resulting<br>
spherical base granules are taken out.<br>
[0029]<br>
The spherical base granules obtained by the present invention can be<br>
used as granules, capsules, tablets or the like after subjected to particle size<br>
regulation and sustained release film coating, enteric film coating, or bitter-taste<br>
masking film coating if necessary.<br>
Example 1<br>
[0030]<br>
The present invention will next be described based on some examples.<br>
First, measuring methods of physical properties are described collectively.<br><sphericity of spherical core particles and base granules><br>
The shape of a sample is photographed using a digital microscope<br>
("VH-7000", product of KEYENCE CORPORATION) (with a 50x or 100x lens)<br>
and a short diameter (D) and a long diameter (L) of 50 particles are measured<br>
using an image analyzer ("Image Hyper", product of Inter Quest). The terms<br>
"short diameter" and "long diameter" as used herein mean a short side and a<br>
long side of a minimum (in area) circumscribed rectangle of boundary pixels of<br>
a particle, respectively. The sphericity is an average of a short diameter/long<br>
diameter (D/L) ratio<br><average particle size of spherical core particles><br><br>
The average particle size is defined as a value at 50% in the<br>
cumulative distribution of the small diameter (D) determined in the same<br>
manner as the measuring method of a sphericity.<br><water absorbing capacity of spherical core particles><br>
It can be determined in the following manner: 30 mL of purified water is<br>
added to 10 g (in terms of a dried sample) of a sample. After the resulting<br>
mixture is left as is at room temperature for one hour, the resulting mixture is<br>
naturally filtered through a filter paper to separate a solid and water attached to<br>
the surface of the solid mass is wiped off lightly with another filter paper. Then,<br>
the sample is weighed and the amount of contained water is divided by 10. The<br>
above-described operation is repeated five times and an average is adopted as<br>
the water absorbing capacity.<br><tapped bulk density of spherical core particles><br>
A 100 cm3 graduated cylinder is filled with 30 g of a sample and a<br>
tapped volume [cm3] after tapping about 30 times is measured. The tapped<br>
bulk density is calculated in accordance with the following equation. This<br>
operation is repeated three times and an average is adopted as a tapped bulk<br>
density.<br>
Apparent tapped bulk density [g/cm3] = 30 [g]/tapped volume [cm3].<br><recovery ratio of spherical base granules><br>
The recovery ratio is determined in accordance with the following<br>
equation based on the recovery amount [g] of spherical base granules after<br>
layering and total amount [g] of raw materials employed.<br>
Recovery ratio [mass%] = (recovery amount [g]/total amount [g] of raw<br>
materials) x 100<br><agglomeration ratio of spherical base granules><br>
After dispersion of spherical base granules on paper, the number [a] of<br>
particles constituting agglomerated granules and the number [b] of single<br>
isolated particles are counted visually. The agglomeration ratio is calculated in<br><br>
accordance with the following equation. The number of particles observed is<br>
1000 (=a+b).<br>
Agglomeration ratio [%] = {a/(a+b)} x 100<br><tackiness><br>
A layering liquid (3 g) is poured in a polypropylene Petri dish having a<br>
diameter of 8 cm and dried at 40°C in an air-circulation-free dryer ("FC610",<br>
product of Advantec Co. .Ltd.). Within three seconds after taking out the dried<br>
product from the dryer, tackiness of the dried film when an index finger is<br>
pressed against the film for two seconds and then released therefrom is<br>
evaluated by a panel of three experts. The tackiness is rated as "1" when no<br>
tackiness is observed, "2" when a little tackiness is observed, "3" when<br>
tackiness is observed, "4" when strong tackiness is observed, and "5" when<br>
very strong tackiness is observed. The tackiness of the dried film is evaluated<br>
by the average of them.<br>
It is known empirically that agglomeration occurs during layering when<br>
the tackiness is "3" or higher so that the layering rate must be set low to prevent<br>
it. Layering cannot be performed in practice when the tackiness is "5".<br>
[0031] [Example 1]<br>
(Preparation of layering liquid)<br>
6.0 g of D-mannitol (product of Towa Kasei Kogyo Co., Ltd.) of a low<br>
water-soluble saccharide was added to 99.6 g of water while stirring with<br>
propeller. The resulting mixture was stirred until completely dissolved. Then,<br>
2.4 g of povidone ("K-30", product of ISP Tec. Inc.) and 12.0 g of<br>
chlorpheniramine d-maleate (product of Kongo Chemical Co., Ltd.) were added<br>
as a binder and an easily water-soluble drug, respectively, then the resulting<br>
mixture was stirred until completely dissolved to yield a layering liquid.<br>
(Production of spherical base granules)<br>
Spherical base granules having a sphericity of 0.94 were obtained by<br>
charging 0.6 kg of spherical core particles consisting of 100% microcrystalline<br><br>
cellulose ("CELPHERE" CP-203, product of Asahi Kasei Chemicals<br>
Corporation, water absorbing capacity: 1.0 cm3/g, average particle size: 237<br>
urn, sphericity: 0.90, tapped bulk density: 0.96 g/cm3) in a tumbling fluidized-bed<br>
coating apparatus ("Multiplex" MP-01, product of Powrex Corporation) and<br>
layering the spherical core particles with the layering liquid by using a tangential<br>
bottom spray until the coating amount reached 3.4 mass% (2.0 mass% in terms<br>
of the drug) under the conditions of a spray air pressure of 0.16 MPa, a spray<br>
air flow rate of 40 L/min, a inlet-air temperature of 80°C, an outlet-air<br>
temperature of from 45 to 46°C, an air flow of from 37 to 50 m3/h, and a spray<br>
rate of layering liquid of 5.0 g/min (corresponding to the coating rate of 1.4<br>
g/min in terms of a solid content per kg of spherical core particles). During<br>
production, the rotation speed of the rotor was adjusted to 400 rpm until the<br>
layering amount reached 1.7 mass% and then adjusted 450 rpm until the<br>
layering amount reached 3.4 mass%. After that, the rotation speed of the rotor<br>
was reduced to 200 rpm and drying was performed until the outlet-air<br>
temperature increased to 48°C. A heater for charge air was then turned off and<br>
cooling was performed until the outlet-air temperature decreased to 40°C<br>
The spherical base granules thus obtained scarcely attached to the<br>
inside wall of the coating apparatus and a substantially whole amount of them<br>
was collected.<br>
[0032] [Example 2]<br>
(Preparation of layering liquid)<br>
The same layering liquid used in Example 1 was used.<br>
(Production of spherical base granules)<br>
Spherical base granules having a sphericity of 0.94 were obtained by<br>
charging a Wurster coating apparatus ("Multiplex" MP-01 using a Wurster<br>
column, product of Powrex Corporation) with 0.3 kg of the same spherical core<br>
particles as employed in Example 1 and layering the spherical core particles<br><br>
with the layering liquid until the layering amount reached 3.4 mass% (2.0<br>
mass% in terms of the drug) under the conditions of spray air pressure of 0.16<br>
MPa, spray air flow rate of 40 L/min, inlet-air temperature of 75°C, outlet-air<br>
temperature of from 42 to 49°C, air flow of from 31 to 43 m3/h, and spray rate of<br>
layering liquid of 2.5 g/min (corresponding to the coating rate of 1.4 g/min in<br>
terms of a solid content per kg of spherical core particles).<br>
[0033] [Example 3]<br>
(Preparation of layering liquid)<br>
1.5 g of D-mannitol was added to 51.3 g of water while stirring with<br>
propeller. The resulting mixture was stirred until completely dissolved. Then 1.2<br>
g of povidone and 6.0 g of chlorpheniramine d-maleate were added therein, and<br>
the resulting mixture was stirred until completely dissolved to obtain a layering<br>
liquid.<br>
(Production of spherical base granules)<br>
In the same manner as Example 2 except that layering of the spherical<br>
core particles was performed at a spray rate of the layering liquid of 2.5 g/min<br>
(corresponding to a coating rate of 1.2 g/min in terms of a solid content per kg<br>
of spherical core particles) until the coating amount reached 2.9 mass% (2.0<br>
mass% in terms of the drug), spherical base granules having a sphericity of<br>
0.93 were obtained.<br>
[0034] [Example 4]<br>
(Preparation of layering liquid)<br>
0.3 g of D-mannitol was added to 52.5 g of water while stirring with<br>
propeller, and stirring was continued until completely dissolved. Then 1.2 g of<br>
povidone and 6.0 g of chlorpheniramine d-maleate were aded therein, and the<br>
resulting mixture was stirred until completely dissolved to obtain a layering<br>
liquid.<br><br>
(Production of spherical base granules)<br>
In the same manner as Example 2 except that layering of the spherical<br>
core particles was performed at a spray rate of the layering liquid of 2.5 g/min<br>
(corresponding to a coating speed of 1.0 g/min per kg of spherical core<br>
particles) until the layering amount reached 2.5 mass% (2.0 mass% in terms of<br>
the drug), spherical base granules having a sphericity of 0.92 were obtained.<br>
[0035] [Example 5]<br>
(Preparation of layering liquid)<br>
13.0 g of D-mannitol was added to 81.0 g of water while stirring with<br>
propeller, and stirring was continued until completely dissolved. Then 1.0 g of<br>
povidone and 5.0 g of chlorpheniramine d-maleate therein were added, and the<br>
resulting mixture was stirred until completely dissolved to obtain a layering<br>
liquid.<br>
(Production of spherical base granules)<br>
In the same manner as Example 2 except that layering of the spherical<br>
core particles was performed at a spray rate of the layering liquid of 2.0 g/min<br>
(corresponding to a coating rate of 1.3 g/min in terms of a solid content per kg<br>
of spherical core particles) until the layering amount reached 7.6 mass% (2.0<br>
mass% in terms of the drug), spherical base granules having a sphericity of<br>
0.96 were obtained.<br>
[0036] [Example 6]<br>
(Preparation of layering liquid)<br>
1.5 g of lactose ("Pharmatose 200M", product of DMV) was added to<br>
51.3 g of water while stirring with propeller, and stirring was continued until<br>
completely dissolved. Then, 1.2 g of povidone and 6.0 g of chlorpheniramine<br>
d-maleate were added therein, and the resulting mixture was stirred until<br>
completely dissolved to obtain a layering liquid.<br><br>
(Production of spherical base granules)<br>
In the same manner as Example 2 except that layering of the spherical<br>
core particles was performed at a spray rate of the layering liquid of 2.5 g/min<br>
(corresponding to a coating rate of 1.2 g/min in terms of a solid content per kg<br>
of spherical core particles) until the layering amount reached 2.9 mass% (2.0<br>
mass% in terms of the drug), spherical base granules having a sphericity of<br>
0.91 were obtained.<br>
[0037] [Comparative Example 1]<br>
(Preparation of layering liquid)<br>
In the same manner as Example 1 except that D-mannitol was not<br>
added, a layering liquid was prepared. Described specifically, 2.4 g of povidone<br>
as a binder and 12.0 g of chlorpheniramine d-maleate were added to 105.6 g of<br>
water while stirring with propeller and the resulting mixture was stirred until<br>
completely dissolved to obtain a layering liquid.<br>
(Production of spherical base granules)<br>
In the same manner as Example 1 except that layering of the spherical<br>
core particles was performed until the layering amount reached 2.4 mass% (2.0<br>
mass% in terms of the drug) under the conditions of an outlet-air temperature of<br>
from 42 to 46°C, an air flow of from 40 to 55 m3/h, and a spray rate of the<br>
layering liquid of 5.0 g/min (corresponding to a coating rate of 1.0 g/min in terms<br>
of a solid content per kg of spherical core particles), spherical base granules<br>
having a sphericity of 0.92 were obtained. The rotation speed of a rotor was<br>
adjusted to 400 rpm until the layering amount reached 1.2 mass% and then<br>
adjusted to 450 rpm until the layering amount reached 2.4 mass%.<br>
Since the spherical base granules had high tackiness and attached to<br>
the inside of the coating apparatus, their recovery ratio was low.<br><br>
[0038] [Comparative Example 2]<br>
In the same manner as Comparative Example 1 except that the spray<br>
rate of the layering liquid was adjusted to 2.5 g/min (corresponding to a coating<br>
rate of 0.5 g/min in terms of a solid content per kg of spherical core particles),<br>
spherical base granules having a sphericity of 0.92 were obtained.<br>
[0039] [Comparative Example 3]<br>
(Preparation of layering liquid)<br>
The same layering liquid as employed in Comparative Example 1 was<br>
used.<br>
(Production of spherical base granules)<br>
It was tried to carry out layering of spherical core particles until the<br>
layering amount reached 2.4 mass% (2.0 mass % in terms of the drug) in the<br>
same manner to Example 4, but operation was terminated because the<br>
spherical base formed a mass on the bottom of the column when the layering<br>
amount reached 0.84 mass%, thus stopped flowing.<br>
[0040] [Comparative Example 4]<br>
(Preparation of layering liquid)<br>
A layering liquid was prepared in the same manner as Example 1.<br>
(Production of spherical base granules)<br>
It was tried to carry out layering of spherical core particles until the<br>
layering amount reached 3.4 mass% (2.0 mass% in terms of the drug) in the<br>
same manner to Example 2 except that spherical granules ("Nonpareil" NP-101,<br>
grain size: 32-42 type, product of Freund Corporation, average particle size:<br>
423 urn, sphericity: 0.91) composed of purified sucrose and corn starch was<br>
used as the spherical core particles. The spherical base granules formed a<br>
mass on the bottom of the column when the layering amount reached 1.7<br>
mass%, thus stopped flowing so that operation was terminated.<br>
[0041]<br><br>
The results of Examples 1 to 6, and Comparative Examples 1 to 4<br>
are shown in Table 1.<br>
The layering liquids obtained in Examples 1 to 6 according to the<br>
present invention each showed low tackiness, and the recovery ratio was high<br>
and low agglomeration of the spherical base granules was observed.<br>
In contrast, the layering liquids obtained in Comparative Examples 1 to<br>
3 which comprised no low water-soluble saccharide showed high tackiness. As<br>
a result, the spherical base granules thus obtained had high tackiness and<br>
attached to the inside wall of the apparatus, leading to a low recovery ratio.<br>
Moreover, the agglomeration ratio was high, thus the spherical base granules<br>
were not suited for film coating.<br>
In Comparative Example 3 in which a Wurster column (guide tube)<br>
was used, the spherical base granules formed a mass on the bottom of the<br>
column, which prevented completion of layering.<br>
In Comparative Example 4 in which the spherical core particles<br>
comprising no microcrystalline cellulose were used, the spherical base granules<br>
obtained had high tackiness in spite of low tackiness of the layering liquid so<br>
that layering was not completed.<br><br><br><br>
[0043]<br>
SEM photographs of the spherical base granules obtained in Example<br>
1 and an example of unagglomerated spherical base granules obtained in<br>
Comparative Examples 1 and 2 are shown in FIGS. 1 to 3.<br>
The spherical base granules obtained in Example 1 and Comparative<br>
Example 1, both of which had a high spray rate of the layering liquid, had a<br>
smooth surface, while the spherical base granules obtained in Comparative<br>
Example 2, which had a low spray rate, had a surface inferior in smoothness.<br>
[0044] [Referential Example 1]<br>
5.0 g of lactose ("Pharmatose" 200M, product of DMV) as a low water-<br>
soluble saccharide was added to 83.0 g of water while stirring with propeller,<br>
and the resulting mixture was stirred until completely dissolved. Then, 2.0 g of<br>
polyvinylpyrrolidone and 10.0 g of chlorpheniramine d-maleate as an easily<br>
water-soluble drug were added, and the resulting mixture was stirred until<br>
completely dissolved. The tackiness of the layering liquid was measured.<br>
[0045] [Referential Example 2]<br>
In the same manner as Referential Example 1 except that maltose (product of<br>
Wako Pure Chemical Industries) was used as the low water-soluble saccharide<br>
instead of lactose, a layering liquid was prepared and tackiness thereof was<br>
measured.<br><br>
[0046] [Referential Comparative Example 1]<br>
In the same manner as Referential Example 1 except that sorbitol<br>
(product of Nikken Kagaku Co., Ltd.) (solubility in 1 cm3 of water: 0.9 g) which<br>
was not a low water-soluble saccharide was used instead of lactose, a layering<br>
liquid was prepared and tackiness thereof was measured.<br>
[0047] [Referential Comparative Example 2]<br>
In the same manner as Referential Example 1 except that fructose<br>
(product of Wako Pure Chemical Industries) (solubility in 1 cm3 of water: 0.6 g)<br>
which was not a low water-soluble saccharide was used instead of lactose, a<br>
layering liquid was prepared and tackiness thereof was measured.<br>
[0048] [Referential Example 3]<br>
5.0 g of lactose was added to 88.0 g of water while stirring with<br>
propeller and the resulting mixture was stirred until completely dissolved. Then,<br>
2.0 g of polyvinylpyrrolidone and 10.0 g of loxoprofen sodium (product of<br>
OHARA Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.) which was an easily water-soluble drug were<br>
added and the resulting mixture was stirred until completely dissolved. The<br>
tackiness of the resulting solution was measured.<br>
[0049] [Referential Comparative Example 3]<br>
2.0g of polyvinylpyrrolidone and 10.0 g of loxoprofen sodium were<br>
added to 88.0 g of water while stirring with propeller. The resulting mixture was<br>
stirred until completely dissolved and the tackiness of the solution was<br>
measured.<br>
[Referential Comparative Example 4]<br><br>
[0050]<br>
In the same manner as Referential Example 3 except that sorbitol was<br>
used instead of lactose, a layering liquid was prepared and tackiness thereof<br>
was measured.<br>
[Referential Comparative Example 5]<br>
[0051]<br>
In the same manner as Referential Example 3 except that fructose was<br>
used instead of lactose, a layering liquid was prepared and tackiness was<br>
measured.<br>
[0052]<br>
The composition and tackiness of each of the layering liquids obtained in<br>
Referential Examples 1 to 3 and Referential Comparative Examples 1 to 5 are<br>
shown in Table 2.<br>
The layering liquids of Referential Examples 1 to 3 comprising a low<br>
water-soluble saccharide had low tackiness irrespective of the kind of the easily<br>
water-soluble drug employed.<br>
In contrast, the layering liquids of Referential Comparative Examples<br>
comprising no low water-soluble saccharide each had high tackiness. In<br>
particular, results of Referential Comparative Examples 1,2,4, and 5 have<br>
revealed that sorbitol and fructose which are high water-soluble do not show a<br>
tackiness reducing effect although they are saccharides.<br><br><br><br>
