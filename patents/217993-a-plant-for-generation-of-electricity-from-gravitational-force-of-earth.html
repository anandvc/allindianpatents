				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION;<br>
The invention relates to generation of electrical energy by conversion of forces occurring in nature. The invention is in the field of electric power generation.<br>
BACKGROUND AMD PRIOR ART;<br>
Generation of electric power has been on the increase ever since the discovery of electricity itself. In the prior art, electric power is produced by conversion of thermal energy, as in thermal or nuclear power plants or potential energy, as In hydroelectricity (hydel) power plants. Predominantly the generation of electricity the world over is achieved through thermal power plants. These power plants use some form of fuel which is either burnt, or as in nuclear plants, atomic reaction is caused to produce heat. This heat in turn produces hot gas or steam which rotates a generator. The rotating generator produces electricity.<br>
Burning of any fuel like coal, oil or natural gas gives rise to a number of associated problems like atmospheric pollution, environmental pollution, health hazards, global warming, increase of green house gases etc. Depletion of the limited stock of fossil fuels of the earth is another major concern. Nuclear plants lead to very serious health problems due to radiation, pollution of the earth's elements due to disposal of spent atomic fuel and carry a big risk of atomic explosion also with them. Another big disadvantage with thermal plants is that they must be located near the fuel source (coal field, oil field, gas wells etc.) to minimize transportation cost of fuel as also reduce risk of stoppage of power generation due to blockage of fuel supply transportation. This limitation on the other hand necessiates long transmission lines to carry the electric power to consumers and very large (upto32%) loss of the generated power during its transmission. In the case of coal based thermal power plants, huge quantities of ash is produced which must first be restricted from emission into atmosphere then be properly disposed of. All the<br><br>
Etectric power generating stations require expert personnel for their operation and maintenance. For all these reasons, the cost of generation of electric power is very high and is steadily increasing. The invention seeks to overcome the above mentioned drawbacks of the prior art.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION:<br>
The primary object of the invention is to achieve generation of electric power at a fraction of the cost compared to the cost as per prior art. Another object of the invention is to eliminate the need of any fuel or consumption of any material for generation of electric power. A further object is to generate electricity without causing any deterioration of the environment. Yet another object of the invention is to enable electricity generation almost at any location.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION:<br>
According to the invention, hollow cylindrical shaped buckets with flat or hemispherical bottom are fixed to a chain at equal distance. These hollow buckets are designed with open and closed portions with predetermined ratio to float in water. The ratio of open and closed portion of the bucket is predetermined. The buckets are provided with an open recess on the top portion which can hold mercury. When mercury is poured into this portion of the bucket, its weight increases and the mercury-loaded bucket sinks in water. This mercury loading is essential to overcome the upward water thrust on the gate of J-shaped water column. These buckets are fixed all along the length of a continuous chain, which passes through a J-shaped water column having stationary water. The chain passes over a specially designed toothed gear wheel. This gear wheel is fixed on a separate and independent frame over the J-shaped column to support the weight of the chain and the buckets hanging vertically. It follows therefore, that if the chain is made to move the gear wheel will rotate. The geared wheel is connected to an alternator through a gear train. Htnce the alternator too will rotate. An additional wheel with U-shaped groove on the periphery can also be fixed on the lower portion of the chain. The profile of this U-shape will match with outer cylindrical surface of the bucket. This will enable the use of additional buoyancy<br>
force, if available in the right hand of J-shaped water column. It will also help the smooth movement of the chain and buckets on predetermined path and reduce the requirement of mercury in the system. The continuous movement of the chain is caused by following forces. Firstly, mercury is filled into a number of buckets just above the gate meant for bucket entry.   Some buckets on the gate will be in the form of a 'continuous cylinder* due to the upward water thrust on the gate and variation in liner speed in left and right portions of the chain. As the mass of mercury becomes more than the (upward) thrust exerted by the water column, the buckets will be able to enter the water column through the specially designed valve at the bottom of the gate and move up to lowest part of water column. This gravitational force on mercury filled buckets is used only to overcome the upward water thrust on bucket on gate and their movement up to the lowest portion of water column.<br>
Secondly, once the buckets have traveled a certain distance inside the J-shaped water column, buckets tilt and discharge the mercury from the recess. Immediately the bucket becomes lighter than water and the buoyancy force to buoyancy starts pushing the bucket upwards in the water column. This too causes the chain to move in the same direction. Forces in nature on the mechanism described above give continuous movement to the system but these are not responsible for power generation.<br>
A number of buckets are positioned hanging between top gear wheel and over the gate. The total mass of the hanging buckets will cause an equivalent downward force due to the gravitational force of the earth. This gravitational force will produce a torque on top gear wheel and make it to rotate. This torque on the wheel will be giving proportional electricity output if connected with generator / alternator.<br>
A mercury filling system employing a mercury pump is used for filling the buckets with mercury while in motion. The need to fill mercury and dislodge mercury while the chain is moving imparts limitations on the linear speed of the chain-bucket assembly. This speed has to be kept low. The combined effect of<br>
gravitational and buoyancy forces acting upon the chain causes the chain to keep moving in one direction.<br>
Lifting of mercury for continuous filling of the buckets is power consuming. Hence, the pressure of the water column is utilized to lift the mercury which collects at the bottom of water column upto certain height. This lift of mercury will be in proportion with the pressure of water column.   From this height, mercury is lifted with the help of a pump up to the bucket filling location.<br>
The invention thus provides a plant for generation of electricity from gravitational<br>
force of earth, comprising of a plurality of buckets each having a hollow enclosed<br>
chamber and an open recess fixed equidistantly on chain which passes over and<br>
is supported by geared wheel, said geared wheel being coupled to gear train<br>
which is in turn coupled to alternator, mercury system having mercury pump,<br>
collection and delivery pipes, a J-shaped water column having entry valve<br>
positioned at the bottom opening, characterized in that the motion of the chain is<br>
caused by the gravitational force acting on the hanging buckets.<br>
The invention will now be described in detail with the help of the accompanying<br>
drawings.<br>
Fig.l Shows the plant for generation of electricity as per invention.<br>
Fig.2 shows the details of the valve for entry of buckets into water column.<br>
A number of specially designed identical buckets (1) having a hollow enclosed<br>
chamber (2) and an open recess (3) are fixed on to chain (4) equidistantly. The<br>
chain and bucket assembly passes over geared wheel (5) which supports its<br>
weight on independent frame. A J- shaped water column (9) has a special valve<br>
(8) at its bottom opening, through which the buckets can enter the water<br>
column. The geared wheel (5) is mechanically connected to a gear train (6)<br>
which drives an alternator (7) so that when the geared wheel rotates, the<br>
alternator also rotates at a higher speed to generate electricity. A mercury<br>
system (12) is depicted on the left side of the drawing. It consists of mercury<br>
(11), mercury pump (10) and pipes (13) for collection and delivery of the<br>
mercury in mercury circuit. The mercury system is designed to fill the open<br>
recess (3) of any bucket (1) while it is in downward motion and passes through a pre-determined height near the mercury delivery outlet. The buckets hanging in air have their open recess (3) facing vertically upwards, while the buckets in the water column (9) are inverted, their open recess facing downwards.<br>
The entry valve (8) depicted in Fig 2 is specially designed to ensure entry of buckets into the water column without leakage of water. It has an annular hard rubber ring (14) which fits tightly around a vertical pipe(15) preferably made of polished stainless steel, through which the buckets travel to enter the water column. The bottom portion of the rubber ring (14) extends beyond the bottom edge of the pipe (15). This entry valve is positioned at the bottom opening of the water column (9),<br>
OPERATION:<br>
Initially, the column (9) will be filled with water. The mercury system (12) will simultaneously fill a certain number of buckets over the gate with mercury. The chain and bucket assembly will have to be moved mechanically during the initial mercury filling operation. When the requisite number of buckets are filled with mercury, the total weight of the filled buckets will exceed the thrust exerted by the water column on the bucket at the entry point, i.e, inside valve (8). The buckets will then move further downwards through the valve and enter the water. During this period the next bucket at the mercury filling level will also get filled, hence the next bucket in the valve will enter water. This phenomenon will set the chain and bucket assembly in continuous motion. The buckets, while travelling further downward in water are guided to take a U-turn in the bottom portion of the J-shaped water column. Consequently, the mercury held in recess (3) will start falling down and collect at lowest point of water column. The bucket will be empty again. Each such bucket will experience upward thrust due to buoyancy, since an empty bucket is designed to float in water. The buoyant force acting on all the empty bucket inside the water column will further add to the continuous motion of the chain and bucket assembly, Under the condition described above, the geared wheel (5) will be rotated<br>
continuously and the alternator, being coupled to the geared wheel through gear train (6) will also achieve continuous rotation. This will generate electricity continuously.<br>
The continuity of the rotation will be maintained by the continuity of filling mercury into the buckets. The operation of the plant does not consume any fuel. Mercury, once procured, does not need any replenishment as it remains unaffected by exposure to either water or air. There is no need to fill in water in the water column also, once it is filled. However, small water quantities to eater to evaporation and spillage losses will have to be periodically replenished.<br>
The plant as per the invention is totally non-polluting. It is very economical to construct and operate. It can easily be located anywhere, irrespective of considerations like closeness to fuel sources. This can obviate to a large extent the necessity of transmission lines to carry power, and the related loss of generated electric power.<br><br><br><br>
