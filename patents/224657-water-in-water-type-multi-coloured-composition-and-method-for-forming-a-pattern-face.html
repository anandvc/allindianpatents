SPECIFICATION MULTI-COLOURED PAINT COMPOSITION, AND METHOD FOR ORMING A PATTERN FACE<br>
'echnical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a new water-in-water type nulti-coloured paint composition.<br>
Sackground of the Art<br>
Hitherto, paints which are generally called flat paints have &gt;een frequently used at the time of painting interior or exterior faces &gt;f buildings, such as wall faces, ceilings and doors.   Typical sxamples of the flat paints are paints prescribed in JIS K5663 'Synthetic Resin Emulsion Paints".   Such a flat paint can exhibit rarious colors by using pigments to perform color-adjustment. However, the color obtained by the flat paint is a single color, and a pattern wherein plural colors are present to be mixed cannot be shown by a single painting operation.<br>
On the other hand, various paint compositions which can show a multi-coloured pattern by a single painting operation are suggested.   An idea about the composition of such a paint was started from a patent issued to P. Busch.   A typical example thereof is an oil-in-water type multi-coloured paint made practicable by J. C. Zola as U.S. Patent No. 2591904 and Japanese Patent No. 231698. Thereafter, home and foreign paint engineers have been developing various multi-coloured paints.   These can be classified to i) an oil-in-water type (O/W type), 11) a water-in-oil type (W/O type), ill) an oil-in-oil type (O/O type), and iv) a water-in-water type (W/W type).<br>
For example, Japan Patent Laid-Open Application (JP-A) No. He 19-302281 describes a multi-coloured paint comprising<br><br>
enamel-dispersed particles obtained by dispersing enamel yielded by use of a copolymer containing a crossllnking functional group into an aqueous type dispersive medium and then incorporating a crossllnking component therein.   However, the paint described in this publication is an oll-in-water type multi-coloured paint comprising an organic solvent in the enamel-dispersed particles. Thus, when the paint is dried, an odor of the solvent is generated. The enamel-dispersed particles in the publication have a high hardness, and a substantially spherical, three-dimensional shape. It is therefore difficult to form a flat and smooth paint film.<br>
In water-in-water multi-coloured paints wherein aqueous type particles are dispersed In an aqueous type medium, a problem of generation of odor, as described above, can be largely improved.   An example of such a water-in-water type multi-coloured paint is a paint described In Japan Patent 2651533.   The paint in this publication is a paint comprising scaly gel colored particles made from sodium alginate, polyvinyl alcohol or the like and hollow particles such as hollow resin foams and inorganic balloons.   When the paint in the publication is used, a relatively flat and smooth paint film can be formed.   However, in the paint in the publication, the hollow particles have light scattering property; therefore, formed paint films become off-white so that the finished surfaces lack vividness.<br>
Another example of the water-in-water multi-coloured paint is a paint described in Patent 2525197.<br>
However, colored particles described in this publication are encapsulated particles, and a liquid aqueous-type paint Is encapsulated in the particles.   For this reason, the capsules break dependency on painting conditions so that a desired pattern may not be formed.   In particular, when roller painting or brush painting is performed, problems such that a color oozes out from the particles<br><br>
are easily caused.   In the paint in the publication, the inside of the capsules is liquid; therefore, there also arises a problem that formed patterns vary easily in accordance with the temperature and painting pressure when the paint is applied.<br>
Disclosure of the Invention<br>
In light of such problems, the present invention has been made.   Objects thereof are to provide a practical water-in-water type multi-coloured paint which makes it possible to form a paint film excellent in flatness and smoothness, and a painting method thereof.<br>
A first object of this invention is to provide a water-in-water type multi-coloured paint which makes it possible to form a mat paint film excellent in flatness, smoothness and vividness.<br>

In order to solve these objects, the present inventor has been eagerly investigated.<br>

Best Modes for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
The present invention, together with embodiments thereof, will be described in detail hereinafter. (Transparent paint)<br>
In the composition of this invention, a transparent paint Is used as a dispersive medium.   This transparent paint comprises an aqueous resin as an essential component.   It is sufficient that the degree of the transparency is such a degree that the flat colored gel particles can be recognized by visual observation and vividness is not lost.<br>
The aqueous resin in the transparent paint is a component having a function for fixing the colored gel particles when a paint film is formed.   As such an aqueous resin, a water-dispersible resin and/or a water-soluble resin can be used.   Examples of the kind of<br><br>
the resin Include acryl resin, urethane resin, vinyl acetate resit., silicone resin, fluorine-contained resin, acryl-vinyl acetate resin, acryl-urethane resin, acryl-silicone resin, polyvinyl alcohol, and cellulose derivatives.   One or more thereof can be used.<br>
Such an aqueous resin may be a resin having a nature that crosslinking reaction is generated after a paint film is formed.   By having such crosslinking reactivity, properties of a paint film such as water resistance, weather resistance, dirt resistance and chemical resistance can be made high.<br>
In the case of forming a mat paint film, a mat transparent paint is suitable as the dispersive medium.   This mat transparent paint can be obtained by mixing the above-mentioned transparent paint with an extender pigment having a refractive index of 1.4 to 1.7.   By using such an extender pigment in the mat transparent paint, the vividness of the paint film can be kept and at the same time mat effect can be obtained.   Examples of the extender pigment which can be used include heavy calcium carbonate, calcite, light calcium carbonate, white carbon, talc, kaolin, clay, potter's clay, china clay, diatomaceous earth, barite powder, barium sulfate, precipitating barium sulfate, silica sand, silica rock powder, quartz powder, and resin powder (except hollow material).   These may be used alone or in a combination of two or more thereof.   The refractive index is a value measured by use of an Abbe refractometer.<br>
The average particle size of the extender pigment Is usually 20 um or less, preferably from 0.1 to 15 um, and more preferably from 0.5 to 8 um.   By using the extender pigment having such an average particle size, the vividness of the paint film can be made higher.   The average particle size referred to herein means a 50% particle size measured with a particle size distribution analyzer using a centrifugal settlement system.<br><br>
The blend ratio of the extender pigment in the mat transparent paint is usually from 5 to 200 parts by weight, preferably from 10 to 100 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of solid content in the aqueous resin.<br>
The "mat" in this invention includes not only ordinary mat but also only thirty-percent gloss, fifty-percent gloss and some other gloss.   Specifically, in this invention, gloss can be specified by specular gloss.   The specular gloss of the above-mentioned mat transparent paint is usually 40 or less, preferably 20 or less, and more preferably 10 or less.   The gloss of the mat transparent paint can be appropriately adjusted by selecting the kind and the particle size of the extender plgment(s) used in the mat paint, the blend ratio between the pigments, and other factors.<br>
The specular gloss is a value measured in accordance with 7.6 "Specular Gloss" in JIS K5400. Specifically, this is a value obtained by applying a paint to one surface of a glass plate with a B-type film applicator having a gap of 150 um in length, placing the paint-applied surface horizontally, and measuring the specular gloss (measuring angle: 60 degrees) of the surface after drying the plate at a temperature of 20°C and a relative humidity of 65% for 48 hours. (Flat colored gel particles)<br>
In the composition of this invention, flat colored gel particles (hereinafter referred to merely as "colored particles'* on occasion) are dispersed in the above-mentioned transparent paint.   In this invention, a flat and smooth paint film can be formed by the matter that the shape of the colored particles is Oat.   The word "flat" used in this invention means the state that the ratio of the short diameter to the thickness is more than 1.   The short diameter and the long diameter of the colored particles are not particularly limited, and are usually from 0.01 to 10 mm, preferably from 0.1 to 5 mm, and more<br><br>
preferably from 0.7 to 2 mm.<br>
At least one kind of the colored particles must be contained in the composition.   In order to show a colorful pattern face, it is desired that two or more kinds of colored particles having different color tones are contained.   The color tone of the particles can be appropriately set dependently on a desired pattern.   As the colored particles, particles having transparency may be contained.<br>
The blend ratio of the colored particles is usually from 50 to 1000 parts by weight, preferably from 100 to 900 parts by weight, and more preferably from 200 to 800 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of solid content in the aqueous resin contained in the transparent paint.<br>
A gelatinized product made from an aqueous resin (a), a color pigment (b), water (c) and a reactive compound (d) which can react in the presence of water is preferable as the colored particles in the composition of this invention.   Such colored particles have both of appropriate softness and strength, and an unchanged colorful pattern can be formed even if painting conditions such as a painting tool and painting temperature are changed.   In the case of performing roller painting or brush painting as well as spray painting, it is possible to prevent the generation of ooze based on the pigment out of the colored particles, or others.   It is therefore possible to obtain a water-in-water type multi-coloured paint which is also useful for roller painting or brush painting.<br>
Specifically, such colored particles can be obtained by mixing the reactive compound (d) which can react In the presence of water with a water-based paint comprising the aqueous resin (a), the color pigment (b) and water (c) to gelatinize the water-based paint, and then dispersing this gelatinized product into the transparent paint.<br>
The aqueous resin (hereinafter referred to the M(a)<br><br>
component") in the water-based paint functions as a vehicle.   A water-dispersible resin and/or a water-soluble resin can be used as the aqueous resin.   Specific examples thereof include acryl resin emulsion, urethane resin emulsion, vinyl acetate resin emulsion, silicone resin emulsion, fluorine-contained resin emulsion, acryl-vinyl acetate resin emulsion, acryl-urethane resin emulsion, acryl-silicone resin emulsion, polyvinyl alcohol, poly(meth)acrylic acid, polyethylene oxide, water-soluble urethane, bio gum, galactomannan derivatives, alginlc acid or derivatives thereof, cellulose derivatives, gelatin, casein, albumin, and products obtained by modifying them chemically by oxidization, methylation, carboxymethylation, hydroxyethylatioa, hydroxypropylation, sulfation, phosphorylation, or catlonization.   One or more thereof can be used.<br>
The blend amount of the (a) component in the water-based paint is usually from 3 to 95% by weight, preferably from 5 to 80% by weight.<br>

One or more thereof can be used.<br>
The blend amount of the (b) component in the water-based paint is usually from 0.01 to 50% by weight, preferably from 0.5 to 40% by weight.<br>
As a dispersing agent for the (b) component, a polymer dispersing agent is preferable since the color stability of the colored particles, in particular, the color stability at the time of storage at high temperature can be improved.<br>
The molecular weight of such a polymer dispersing agent is usually from 2000 to 100000, preferably from 5000 to 50000. Specific examples thereof include anionic polymer dispersing agents* nonionic polymer dispersing agents, cationic polymer dispersing agents, and amphoteric polymer dispersing agents.   One or more thereof can be used.   Among these, the cationic polymer dispersing agents are preferable for this invention.<br>
The HLB of the polymer dispersing agent is desirably from 3 to 15, more desirably from 5 to 10.   When the polymer dispersing agent having such an HLB is used, the color stability of the colored particles can be further improved.   The HLB is an abbreviation of the balance between hydrophilicity and lipophilicity, and is a numerically-expressed strength ratio between hydrophilicity and lipophilicity of an amphipathic substance.<br>
The reactive compound which can react in the presence of water (hereinafter referred to as the "(d) component") is a component for gelatinizing the water-based paint comprising the<br><br>
above-mentioned (a) to (c) components.<br>
In the case that the (a-1) component I* used as the (a) component in this invention, a reactive compound which can react with the (a-1) component in the presence of water (hereinafter referred to the Hd-1 component") is preferable as the (d) component.

The blend amount of the (d) component is usually from 0.1 to 10% by weight, preferably from 0.3 to 6% by weight of the water-based paint.   In the case that the (d) component is a little, the capabUity of forming gel is insufficient.   Thus, it is feared that the colored particles are broken at the time ot painting (in particular, at the time of roUer painting or brush painting).   In the case that the (d) component is rich, the colored particles become hard so that a flat and smooth paint film is not easUy obtained.<br>
In order to promote the reaction of the (d) component, a catalyst for the (d) component can be mixed as necessary. Examples of such a catalyst include inorganic acids such as hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, nitric acid and phosphoric acid; organic acids such as acetic acid, benzenesulfonic acid and toluene sulfonic acid; alkali catalysts such as sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, ammonia, and amine compounds; organic tin compounds such as dibutyltin dilaurate, dibutyltin dioctylate, and dibutyltin diacetate; organic aluminum compounds such as aluminum tris(acetylacetonate), and aluminum monoacetylacetonate bis(ethylacetoacetate); organic titanium compounds such as titanium tetrakls(actylacetonate); organic<br><br>
zirconium compounds such as zirconium tetrakis(cetylacetonate); and boron compounds such as boric acid. (Process for producing a multi-coloured paint)<br>
In the production of the composition of this invention, the (d) component is first mixed with the water-based paint comprising the (a) to (c) components, thereby preparing a gelatinized product. The gelatinized product in this invention embraces all materials wherein gelatinization reaction is started by the incorporation of the (d) component regardless of the degree of the advance of the gelatinization reaction.<br>
The pH of the water-based paint for forming the gelatinized product is not particularly limited if the gelatinization reaction can be started.   The pH is usually from 7 to 14.   By setting the pH of the water-based paint to such a value, a suitable reactivity can be obtained, in particular, when the (d-2) is used as the (d) component.<br>
It is advisable that the mixture of the water-based paint with the (d) component is usually conducted at ambient temperature.   In order to promote the gelatinization reaction, heating may be conducted.<br>
Next, this gelatinized product is added to an aqueous dispersive medium so as to be dispersed in a flat particle form.   The timing when the gelatinized product is added to the aqueous dispersive medium can be appropriately set, and may be immediately after the water-based paint is mixed with the (d) component or after the resultant is allowed to stand for a given time.<br>
As the aqueous dispersive medium, a part or the whole of the transparent paint can be used.   When the gelatinized product is added to the aqueous dispersive medium, the aqueous resin may not be contained in the aqueous dispersive medium and can be mixed in a subsequent step.<br><br>
In order to make the shape of the formed colored particles into a flat form, it is advisable to select or adjust appropriately the shape of stirring fans, the size and position of the stirring fans relative to a stirring tank, the rotation speed of the stirring fans, the viscosity of the water-based paint, the manner of adding the gelatinized product, the viscosity of the transparent paint, and so on. The particle size of the colored particles can be adjusted in the same way.<br>
Since the shape of the colored particles is flat in this invention, a paint film excellent in flatness can be formed.   The short diameter and the long diameter of the colored particles are not particularly limited, and are usually from 0.01 to 10 mm, preferably from 0.1 to 5 mm, and more preferably from 0.7 to 2 mm.<br>
When the gelatinized product is dispersed in the aqueous dispersive medium, a dispersion stabilizer can also be used. Examples of such a dispersion stabilizer include magnesium salts, calcium salts, barium salts, aluminum salts, sodium salts, potassium salts, and borates.<br>
A component for promoting reaction of unreacted portions of the colored particles can also be incorporated into the aqueous dispersive medium so as to conduct the more reliable gelatinfzation.<br>
The pH of the aqueous dispersing medium is usually from 7 to 10, preferably from 7 to 9. In particular, when the (d-2) component is used, it is desired to set the pH of the aqueous dispersive medium into such a range.<br>
In this invention, after the dispersion of the gelatinized product in the aqueous dispersive medium, the (d-1) can be further blend therewith.   In this case, as the (a) component, the (a-1) component is used.<br>
Through such a step, the (a-1) component and the (d-1)<br><br>
component react with each other in the colored particle surface layer, so as to make the roller painting suitability or brush painting suitability of the multi-coloured paint still higher.   As a result, properties of the paint film such as weather resistance and water resistance can also be improved.<br>
The blend amount of the (d-1) component is usually from about 0.1 to 10% by weight of the colored particles.   It is advisable that the blend of the (d-1) component is usually conducted at ambient temperature.   Heating may be conducted as necessary.<br>
In order to obtain the composition of this invention having two or more colored particles different in color tone, it is advisable to adopt, for example, the following methods:<br>
a method of producing paints wherein colored particles in a single color are dispersed independently, and subsequently mixing these paints; or<br>
a method of adding two or more gelatinized products different in color tone simultaneously or sequentially to the dispersive medium, and dispersing the products in the medium.<br>
Into the composition of this invention, colored particles other than the flat colored gel particles can be incorporated. Examples of such colored particles include natural stone cracked products, colored aggregates, plastic pieces, rubber pieces, metal pieces, and inorganic mineral pieces.<br>
In the composition of this invention, known additives for paint other than the above can be appropriately used.   Examples of such additives include a pigment dispersing agent, an antifoamer, a thickener, an ultraviolet absorber, an antioxidant, an antifungal agent, a preservative, a film-forming aid, and an antifreezing agent. A color pigment may be added to the transparent paint unless the vividness of the resultant paint film is damaged.   An extender<br><br>
pigment or the like can be used in the water-based paint which makes the colored particles. (Painting method)<br>
The composition of this invention can be used for various purposes, for example, for building, building materials, civil engineering, woodwork, plastic products, metal products, non-ferrous metal products, and so on.   Specifically, the composition can be used, for example, as a surface decorating material for various substrates such as concrete, mortal, siding board, extruded plates, plasterboard, perlite board, plywood, plastic board, metal plates, glass, and porcelain tiles.   The surfaces of these substrates may be subjected to any surface treatment (for example, with a sealer, a surfacer, or filler).   The substrate may be a substrate on which a paint film has already been formed, a substrate to which wallpaper is pasted, or some other substrate.<br>
In this invention, it is desired to make an undercoat layer from a colored mat undercoat paint (hereinafter referred to merely as the "undercoat paint" on occasion) before the painting of the multi-coloured paint composition.   Such an undercoat layer has, on the surface thereof, fine irregularities having a size in micrometer order.   The fine irregularities causes an improvement in the painting workability of the multi-coloured paint (in particular, the painting workability at the time of roller painting or blush painting), so that a uniform and even pattern face can be formed.   It is sufficient that the degree of coloration in the undercoat paint is such an extent that the substrate can be hidden.<br>
Specifically, the gloss of the undercoat paint in this invention can be defined by the specular gloss thereof.   The specular gloss of the undercoat paint is usually 40 or less, preferably 20 or less, and more preferably 10 or less.   In the case that the specular gloss of the<br><br>
undercoat paint is high, it is difficult that the undercoat paint is uniformly applied.   The adjustment of the gloss of the undercoat paint can be appropriately performed by the kind and particle size of an extender pigment or extender pigments, which will be described later, the blend ratio between the pigments, and so on.<br>
The undercoat paint can be produced by mixing the aqueous resin, the color pigment, and extender pigment(s).<br>
As the aqueous resin, a water-dispersible resin and/or a water-soluble resin can be used.   Examples of the kind of the resin include acryl resin, urethane resin, vinyl acetate resin, silicone resin, fluorine-contained resin, acryl/vinyl acetate resin, acryl/urethane resin, acryl/silicone resin, polyvinyl alcohol, and cellulose derivatives.   One or more thereof can be used.<br>
Such a water-dispersible resin or water-soluble resin may be a resin having a nature that crosslinking reaction is generated after the formation of a paint film.   By having such crosslinking reactivity, properties of a paint film such as water resistance and adhesiveness can be made high.   Moreover, in the case that the substrate contains lye, gum or the like, the oozing thereof can be prevented if a catlonic aqueous resin is used.<br>
Examples of the color pigment include titanium oxide, zinc oxide, carbon black, lamp black, bone black, graphite, black iron oxide, copper chromium black, cobalt black, copper manganese iron black, red iron oxide, Molybdate Orange, Permanent Red, Permanent Carmine, Anthraquinone Red, Perylene Red, Quinacridon Red, yellow iron oxide, Titan Yellow, Fast Yellow, Benzimidazolone Yellow, chromium green, cobalt green, Phthalocyanine Green, ultramarine blue, Berlin Blue, cobalt blue, Phthalocyanine Blue, Qunacridone Violet, Dioxazine Violet, aluminum pigment and pearl pigment.    By using one or more of these color pigments, the undercoat paint can<br><br>
be colored into a desired color tone.<br>
Examples of the extender pigment include heavy calcium carbonate, calcite, light calcium carbonate, white carbon, talc, kaolin, clay, potter's clay, china clay, diatomaceous earth, barite powder, barium sulfate, precipitating barium sulfate, silica sand, silica rock powder, quartz powder, resin beads, glass beads, and hollow balloons.   One or more thereof can be used.   The average particle size of the extender pigment is usually from 0.1 to 500 um, preferably from 1 to 200 um.<br>
About the blend ratio of each of the components in the undercoat paint, the amount of the color pigment is from 1 to 300 parts by weight (preferably from 5 to 200 parts by weight), and the amount of the extender pigment is from 5 to 300 parts by weight (preferably from 10 to 200 parts by weight) per 100 parts by weight of solid content in the aqueous resin.<br>
In the undercoat paint, known additives for paint can be appropriately used besides the above-mentioned components. Examples of such additives include a pigment dispersing agent, an antifoamer, a thickener, an ultraviolet absorber, an antioxidant, an antifungal agent, a preservative, a film-forming aid, and an antifreezlng agent.<br>
The color tone of the undercoat paint is not particularly limited.   It is desired that the color tone is a color which is approximate to that of at least one of the colored particles.   By setting such a color tone, harmonious finish having a highly beautiful appearance can be obtained.<br>
For the application of the undercoat paint, a roller, a brush, a trowel, a spray or the like can be used.   In the case that the applicator is used indoors, a roller or a brush is preferable from the viewpoints of painting workability, applying and adhering ability,<br><br>
and others. At the time of the application, the undercoat paint may be diluted with water. The applying amount of the undercoat paint is usually from 0.05 to 0.5 kg/m3.<br>
It is advisable that the drying of the undercoat paint after the application thereof is usually performed at ambient temperature, and optionally by heating.   The time for the drying is usually from 0.5 to 5 hours.   After drying   the undercoat paint, the multi-coloured paint can be applied thereto.<br>
When the multi-coloured paint is applied, various applicators such as a spay, a roller, a blush, and a trowel can be used.   In particular, in the case that the colored particles are particles made from the (a) to (d) components, a roller or a blush Is preferable.<br>
If the colored particles are particles made from the (a) to (d) components, uniform finish can be obtained when different applicators are used for one surface to be applied.   For this reason, finish giving no feeling of wrongness can be obtained in the case that a roller or a blush is used to repair after spray coating.<br>
At the time of the application, the paint may be diluted with water.   It is advisable that the blend amount of water is appropriately set, considering the kind of the applicator, the state of the undercoat for the application, the temperature at the time of the application, and others.<br>
The applying amount of the composition of this invention is usually from 0.2 to 1.6 kg/m3, preferably from 0.3 to 1.2 kg/m3.   It is advisable that the pattern face after the application of the composition of this Invention may be usually dried at ambient temperature, and optionally by heating.    The time for the drying is usually from 1 to 5 hours.<br>
The top coat layer made from the multi-coloured paint may be a continuous layer or a discontinuous layer.   In particular, in the<br><br>
case that a colored mat paint is used for the undercoat layer, a pattern face giving no feeling of wrongness can be formed even if the top coat layer does not completely cover the undercoat layer.<br>
