				<td>FUNGICIDE COMPOSITION COMPRISING A PHOSPHOROUS ACID DERIVATIVE, A MANDEUAMIDE TYPE COMPOUND AND A FURTHER FUNGICIDE COMPOUND<br>
DESCRIPTION<br>
The invention relates to active compound combinations, in particular within a fungicide composition, which comprise a phosphorous acid derivative (phosphonate or phosphite derivative), a compound of the mandelamide type like mandipropamid and a further fungicide compound. Such combinations are very highly suitable for controlling phytopathogenic fungi.<br>
It is already known that phosphonic acid and some of its derivatives (phosphonates), such as fosetyl-AI, have fungicidal properties. The activity of these compounds is not always adequate at certain application rates notably.<br>
Further it is likewise known that some mandelamide type compounds like mandipropamid possess fungicidal properties. The activity of this compound is good, but in certain cases leave something to be desired at low application rates.<br>
Since, moreover, the environmental and economic requirements imposed on modern-day fungicides are continually increasing, with regard, for example, to the spectrum of action, toxicity, selectivity, application rate, formation of residues, and favourable preparation ability, and since, furthermore, there may be problems, for example, with resistances, a constant task is to develop new fungicide agents which in some areas at least have advantages over their known counterparts.<br>
The invention provides active compound compositions which in some aspects at least achieve the stated objectives.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a fungicide composition comprising:<br>
(I)<br>
A)	a phosphorous acid derivative such as metal phosphites, fosetyl-aluminium or fosetyl-<br>
sodium, and phosphorous acid itself and its alkali metal or alkaline earth metal salts;<br>
B)	a mandelamide type compound of formula (I)<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein<br>
•	R1 represents hydrogen, alkyl, cycloalkyl or substituted or non substituted aryl;<br>
preferably hydrogen, C1C8-alkyl or C3-C8-cycloalkyl;<br>
•	R2 and R3 represent independently hydrogen or alkyl; preferably hydrogen;<br>
•	R4 represents alkyl, alkenyl or alkynyl; preferably methyl or ethyl;<br>
•	R5, R6, R7 and R8 represent independently hydrogen or alkyl; preferably<br>
hydrogen;<br>
•	R9 represents hydrogen, substituted or non substituted alkyl, substituted or non<br>
substituted alkenyl, substituted or non substituted alkynyl; preferably hydrogen;<br>
•	R10 represents  substituted or non substituted aryl  or substituted or non<br>
substituted heteroaryl; preferably phenyl, naphtyl, 1,3-biphenyl or 1,4-biphenyl<br>
each being non substituted or substituted by one or more groups selected in the<br>
list consisting of C1C8-alkyl, C1C8-haloalkyl, C1C8-alkoxy, C1C8-haloalkoxy,<br>
C1C8-alkylthio,    CrCa-haloalkylthio,    halogen,    cyano,    nitro   and   C1C8-<br>
alkoxycarbonyl;<br>
•	Z represents halogen, substituted or non substituted aryloxy, substituted or non<br>
substituted alkoxy, substituted or non substituted alkenyloxy, substituted or non<br>
substituted alkynyloxy, substituted or non substituted arylthio, substituted or<br>
non substituted alkylthio, substituted or non substituted alkenylthio, substituted<br>
or non substituted alkynylthio,  substituted or non substituted alkylsulfinyl,<br>
substituted or non substituted alkenylsulfinyl, substituted or non substituted<br>
alkynylsulfinyl, substituted or non substituted alkylsulfonyl, substituted or non<br>
substituted  alkenylsulfonyl,   substituted  or  non  substituted  alkynylsulfonyl;<br>
preferably C1C8-alkoxy, C2-C6-alkenyloxy, C2-C6-alkynyloxy;<br>
C) a further fungicide compound.<br>
Preferably, the present invention provides a fungicide composition comprising:<br>
A)	a phosphorous acid derivative such as metal phosphites, fosetyl-aluminium or fosetyl-<br>
sodium, and phosphorous acid itself and its alkali metal or alkaline earth metal salts;<br>
B)	mandipropamid; and<br>
C)	a further fungicide compound.<br>
It has been found that the composition according to the invention exhibits very good fungicidal properties. The composition according to the invention possesses a broaden spectrum of activity compared to the existing or known fungicide compositions.<br>
Surprisingly the fungicide activity of the composition according to the invention is substantially higher than the sum of the activities of the individual active compounds. In other words there is an unforeseeable, true synergistic effect and not merely an addition of activities.<br>
The composition according to the invention can also provide an improved systemicity to the active compounds that are used. Indeed, even if some of the used fungicide compounds do not possess any or a satisfying systemicity, within the composition according to the invention these compounds can exhibit such a property.<br>
In a similar manner, the composition according to the invention can allow an increased persistence of the fungicide efficacy of the active compounds that are employed.<br>
Another advantage of the composition according to the invention relies in that an increased curativity is accessible.<br>
Phosphonic acid is referred to in the literature, inter alia, as phosphorous acid (actually a<br>
tautomer  of  phosphonic  acid,   P(OH)3),   and   its  salts,   correspondingly,   as   (secondary)<br>
phosphites.<br>
Preferably, the composition according to the invention comprises fosetyl-AI or phosphorous acid<br>
as compound A. More preferably, fosetyl-AI is chosen as compound A in the composition<br>
according to the invention. The chemical name of fosetyl is ethyl hydrogen phosphonate.<br>
Among the mandelamide type compounds according to the invention, the preferred compound is named mandipropamid. This compound has the following chemical name: 4-chloro-alpha-propynyloxy-N-[2-[3-methoxy-4-(2-propynyloxy)phenyl]ethyl]-benzeneacetamide, which corresponds to the following chemical structure:<br>

Methods :<br>
Vine plants (variety Cabernet Sauvignon) were grown in a sandy soil in plastic pots with a single<br>
plant per pot. At the age of 2 months (6 to 7 leaves developed), these plants were sprayed with<br>
the three fungicide active compounds either alone or in mixture. Fungicide active compounds<br>
applied in mixture were also applied individually at the same doses as those used in the<br>
combinations.<br>
The fungicide active compounds, either used alone or in mixture, were applied at a volume rate<br>
of 250 I water per ha.<br>
The following ratio was tested : fosetyl-AI (A) / mandipropamid (B) / folpet (C) respectively:<br>
1,500 g a.i. /ha +75 g a.i. /ha + 750 g a.i. /ha (ratio 20 /1 /10).<br>
The mixture of fosetyl-AI with mandipropamid and folpet was prepared either with fosetyl-AI in<br>
the form of water-dispersible granules (WG) at 800 g/Kg and mandipropamid in the form of<br>
concentrated suspension (SC) at 100 g/L and folpet in the form of concentrated suspension<br>
(SC) at 500 g/L.<br>
The dose range tested for fosetyl-AI was: 2,500 g a.i. /ha, 1,500 g a.i. /ha, 1,000 g a.i. /ha, 750 g<br>
a.i. /ha, 500 g a.i. /ha, 250 g a.i. /ha, 150 g a.i. /ha, 15 g a.i. /ha, 3 g a.i. /ha, 1.5 g a.i. /ha, 0.15 g<br>
a.i. /ha and 0.015 g a.i./ha.<br>
The dose range for mandipropamid + folpet was: 75 + 750 g a.i. /ha, 1 + 10 g a.i. /ha, 0.1 + 1 g<br>
a.i. /ha, 0.02 + 0.2, 0.01 + 0.1 g a.i. /ha, 0.001+ 0.01 g a.i. /ha and 0.0001 + 0.001 g a.i. /ha.<br>
For the ternary mixture fosetyl-AI + mandipropamid + folpet, the dose range studied was: 1,500<br>
+ 75 + 750 g a.i. /ha, 20 + 1+ 10 g a.i. /ha, 2 + 0.1 + 1 g a.i. /ha, 0.4 + 0.02 + 0.2 g a.i. /ha, 0.2 +<br>
0.01 + 0.1 g a.i. /ha, 0.02 + 0.001 + 0.01 g a.i. /ha and 0.002 + 0.0001 + 0.001 g a.i. /ha.<br>
The UTC plants were only treated with water without any active compound.<br>
A three days interval separated treatment and inoculation. Three days after the treatment, each<br>
plant was inoculated by spraying an aqueous suspension of sporangia of Plasmopara viticola<br>
obtained from infected leaves and sensitive to all the tested compounds. The concentration of<br>
sporangia was about 100,000 units per ml.<br>
After contamination the plants were incubated for 7 days at 22°C in a saturated atmosphere.<br>
Seven days after contamination, symptoms were evaluated in terms of the extent of the lower<br>
surface of the leaves infected, in comparison with untreated (UTC) but contamined plants.The efficacy of the treatment was calculated using the Abbott formula :<br>
efficacy = ( untreated - treated / untreated )x 100<br>
The concentrations of the fungicide active substances alone or in mixture giving % efficacy for each component were determined based on the sigmoid curve dose / response model with their confidence intervals. The results corresponding to ED90, ED70 or ED50 (effective doses providing 90%, 70% or 50% of disease control) for the ratio studied have been calculated on the basis of 4 repeats per factor. The analysis of the results was made according to the TAMMES model. The ED90, ED70 or ED50 values observed for each compound alone or in mixture were then inserted in a graphic representation as described by TAMMES (Isoboles, a graphic representation of synergism in pesticides, Neth.J. Plant Path. 70 (1964): 73-80). Each of the components is expressed in a coordinate. The line which connects the points is called an isobole. With an isobole, the effect of different proportions of the components can be calculated. The observed value for the mixture corresponding to one ratio A / B is compared to the theoretical value calculated via the isobole of additive effect. In that case, the total effect observed is equal to the sum of the effects of the components taken independently. A synergistic effect or a cooperative action of two or more compounds in mixture means that the total effect is greater or more prolonged than the sum of effects of the products taken independently. Results:<br>
For the ternary mixture fosetyl-AI / mandipropamid / folpet, the results obtained are presented in the form of points values, corresponding to 90%, 70% or 50% control of the pathogen and placed in a TAMMES isobole diagram which comprises on the x-axis the doses of fosetyl-AI in g a.i. / ha and on the y-axis the doses of the mixture mandipropamid with folpet expressed in g a.i. / ha. These results are presented in a table with the quantity of each compound in the ternary mixture at the studied ratio (A / B / C) practically observed to control 90%, 70% or 50% of the disease compared to the theoretical quantity of each, expected to supply the same control in the case of no synergy between the 3 active substances.<br>
For the ratio 20/1/10 corresponding to fosetyl-AI with mandipropamid and folpet, the preventive test done on grapevine downy mildew shows synergistic effect of the compositions comprising fosetyl-AI with mandipropamid and folpet. It has been demonstrated that less amount of both compounds are necessary to effectively control 90%, 70% and 50% of the disease compared to the theoretical doses of each compounds expected in the mixture with just additional effect.<br>
In table 2, EC50, EC70, EC90 calculated according to efficacy observed for this ratio illustrate these results.<br>

The dose range tested for fosetyl-AI was : 2,500 g a.i. / ha,1,500g a.i. / ha, 750 g a.i. / ha, 500 g a.i. / ha, 250 g a.i. / ha, 150 g a.i. / ha, 50 g a.i. / ha, 30 g a.i. /ha, 10 g a.i. / ha, 5 g a.i. / ha and 0.5 g a.i./ha.<br>
The dose range for mandipropamid + mefenoxam was: 75 + 75 g a.i. / ha, 0.75 + 0.75 g a.i. / ha, 0.25 + 0.25 g a.i. / ha, 0.15 + 0.15 g a.i. / ha , 0.05 + 0.05 g a.i. / ha, 0.025 + 0.025 g a.i. / ha and 0.0025 + 0.0025 g a.i. / ha.<br>
For the ternary mixture fosetyl-AI + mandipropamid + mefenoxam, the dose range studied was: 1,500 + 75 + 75 g a.i. / ha, 150 + 0.75 + 0.75 g a.i. / ha, 50 +0.25 + 0.25 g a.i. / ha, 30 + 0.15 + 0.15 g a.i. / ha, 10 + 0.05 + 0.05 g a.i. / ha, 5 + 0.025 + 0.025 g a.i. / ha and 0.5 + 0.0025 + .0.0025g a.i./ha.<br>
The UTC plants were only treated with water without any active compound. For managing vapour effect of mefenoxam, all the different factors were separated and isolated after treatment all along the test in independent greenhouse boxes.<br>
A three days interval separated treatment and inoculation. Three days after the treatment, each plant was inoculated by spraying an aqueous suspension of sporangia of Plasmopara viticolaobtained from infected leaves and sensitive to all the tested compounds. The concentration of<br>
v<br>
sporangia was about 100,000 units per ml.<br>
After contamination the plants were incubated for 7 days at 22°C in a saturated atmosphere. Seven days after contamination, symptoms were evaluated in terms of the extent of the lower surface of the leaves infected, in comparison with untreated (UTC) but contamined plants.<br>
The efficacy of the treatment was calculated using the Abbott formula :<br>
efficacy = ( untreated - treated / untreated )x 100<br>
The concentrations of the fungicide active substances alone or in mixture giving % efficacy for each component were determined based on the sigmoid curve dose / response model with their confidence intervals. The results corresponding to ED90, ED70 or ED50 (effective doses providing 90%, 70% or 50% of disease control) for the ratio studied have been calculated on the basis of 4 repeats per factor. The analysis of the results was made according to the TAMMES model. The ED90, ED70 or ED50 values observed for each compound alone or in mixture were then inserted in a graphic representation as described by TAMMES (Isoboles, a graphic representation of synergism in pesticides, Neth.J. Plant Path. 70 (1964): 73-80). Each of the components is expressed in a coordinate. The line which connects the points is called an isobole. With an isobole, the effect of different proportions of the components can be calculated. The observed value for the mixture corresponding to one ratio A / B is compared to the theoretical value calculated via the isobole of additive effect. In that case, the total effect observed is equal to the sum of the effects of the components taken independently. A synergistic effect or a cooperative action of two or more compounds in mixture means that the total effect is greater or more prolonged than the sum of effects of the products taken independently. Results:<br>
For the ternary mixture fosetyl-AI / mandipropamid / mefenoxam, the results obtained are presented in the form of points values, corresponding to 90%, 70% or 50% control of the pathogen and placed in a TAMMES isobole diagram which comprises on the x-axis the doses of fosetyl-AI in g a.i. / ha and on the y-axis the doses of the mixture mandipropamid with mefenoxam expressed in g a.i. / ha. These results are presented in a table with the quantity of each compound in the ternary mixture at the studied ratio (A / B / C) practically observed to control 90%, 70% or 50% of the disease compared to the theoretical quantity of each, expected to supply the same control in the case of no synergy between the 3 active substances.<br>
For the ratio 20/1/1 corresponding to fosetyl-AI with mandipropamid and mefenoxam, the preventive test done on grapevine downy mildew shows synergistic effect of the compositions comprising fosetyl-AI with mandipropamid and mefenoxam. It has been demonstrated that less amount of both compounds are necessary to effectively control 90%, 70% and 50% of thedisease compared to the theoretical doses of e^ch compounds expected in the mixture with just additional effect.<br>
In table 2, EC50, EC70, EC90 calculated according to efficacy observed for this ratio illustrate these results.<br>
