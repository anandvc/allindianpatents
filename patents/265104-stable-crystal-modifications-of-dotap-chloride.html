Stable crystal modifications of DOTAP chloride<br>
The present invention relates to enantiomerically pure DOTAP chloride<br>
and crystal modifications of racemic and enantiomerically pure DOTAP<br>
chloride, to a process for the preparation thereof, and to the use thereof<br>
for the preparation of pharmaceutical compositions.<br>
DOTAP chloride above and below denotes N,N,N-trimethyl-2,3-bis[[(9Z)-<br>
1-oxo-9-octadecenyl]oxy]-1-propanaminium chloride, also known as<br>
(Z,Z)-N,N,N-trimethyl-2,3-bis[(1-oxo-9-octadecenyl)oxy]-1-propanami-<br>
nium chloride or 1,2-dioleoyloxy-3-trimethylammonium propane chloride,<br>
and the hydrates thereof.<br><br>
CAS numbers:    132172-61 -3 and 477274-39-8 (racemate),<br>
197974-73-58 (racemate, monohydrate)<br>
428506-51-8 (2S form), 328250-28-8 (2R form)<br>
Liposomes are synthetic multilayered vesicles (spherically self-contained<br>
membranes) comprising ambiphilic substances, usually natural lipids,<br>
into which both hydrophilic substances can be encapsulated into the<br>
aqueous interior, and also lipophilic substances can be incorporated into<br>
the inside of the lipid membrane.<br>
They are employed in particular in cosmetics and in medicine, especially<br>
in dermatology. Here, in particular vitamins, coenzymes, skin-care agents<br>
and sunscreens are embedded. Liposomes are generally applied topi-<br>
cally.<br>
However, liposomes are increasingly achieving further importance in<br>
pharmaceutical technology, since parenteral application of liposomes<br><br>
WO 2006/056312	PCT/EP2005/011874<br>
-2-<br>
enables more specific organ distribution to be achieved than if the active<br>
compounds are used in freely dissolved form.<br>
If DNA, RNA or proteins are incorporated, lipoplexes are obtained.<br>
Addition of oils and the use of high-pressure homogenisers enables the<br>
formation of so-called nanoparticles (nanoparts) to be forced from lipo-<br>
somes. These are particles of approximately the same size as liposomes,<br>
but which do not have a water phase, but instead an oil phase in their<br>
interior. They are particularly suitable for the encapsulation of lipophilic<br>
substances.<br>
Microemulsions are colloidally disperse, single-phase systems compris-<br>
ing aqueous, lipid-like and surfactant components. They have a particle<br>
size of 1-500 nm and behave in a similar manner to liquids.<br>
Especially in connection with peptidic active compounds, nucleotides,<br>
vaccines and other biopharmaceuticals, which normally have poor solu-<br>
bility, the solubilising effect has very great importance in the case of the<br>
applications described above.<br>
In addition, degradation of the active compounds in the body can be<br>
slowed and a sustained-release effect achieved in this way.<br>
DOTAP chloride belongs to the class of cationic lipids. In contrast to<br>
naturally occurring phospholipids, these do not have a zwitterionic char-<br>
acter. Liposomes comprising cationic lipids, alone or combined with<br>
phospholipids or other lipid-like compounds, have a positively charged<br>
surface. This gives rise to high affinity to cells which have a negatively<br>
charged surface on the outside, for example endothelial cells.<br>
Particularly important, however, is the ability of DOTAP-based and other<br>
cationic liposomes and lipoplexes to penetrate into cells and thus to<br>
transport the active compounds incorporated therein into the interior of<br>
the cell (transfection).<br><br>
WO 2006/056312	PCT/EP2005/011874<br>
-3-<br>
All these properties make DOTAP chloride very interesting for cancer<br>
therapy too. These properties give rise to the possibility of applying con-<br>
ventional cytostatic agents incorporated in cationic DOTAP liposomes.<br>
The transfection properties of DOTAP chloride and other DOTAP salts,<br>
such as, for example, the acetate, bromide, dihydrogenphosphate,<br>
hydrogensulfate, iodide, mesylate, methylsulfate, trifluoroacetate, sulfate<br>
or disulfate and triflate, are adequately known from the literature.<br>
DOTAP dihydrogenphosphate and DOTAP mesylate are only mentioned<br>
as racemate in the literature. All other salts mentioned above are each<br>
mentioned as racemate and as 2S-enantiomer, and in addition the 2R-<br>
enantiomers of the chloride and methylsulfate are mentioned.<br>
In some in-vitro studies, other salts, such as, for example, DOTAP<br>
methylsulfate, have achieved better transfection rates than DOTAP chlo-<br>
ride.<br>
Used in vivo, however, anion exchange at the liposome surface takes<br>
place in the living body, meaning that the advantages of other salts do<br>
not arise here. Especially on medical use in humans in particular for<br>
parenteral application, DOTAP salts with physiologically acceptable<br>
anions, such as, for example, the corresponding chloride or the acetate,<br>
are therefore preferred.<br>
Medical, in particular parenteral applications make the highest demands<br>
of the quality and purity of the active compounds and adjuvants used.<br>
There are therefore very strict regulations on the part of the authorities<br>
with respect to the preparation, reproducibility of preparation and by-<br>
product profile of these compounds. In the case of substances used par-<br>
enterally, microbiological contamination by pathogenic microorganisms<br>
and endotoxins must, in addition, be strictly avoided and controlled.<br>
DOTAP chloride and other DOTAP salts are extremely unstable and are<br>
therefore difficult per se to prepare in an acceptable purity so that they<br>
are suitable for use for the preparation of a medicament formulation.<br><br>
WO 2006/056312	PCT/EP2005/011874<br>
-4-<br>
Like all lipids which carry oleic acid radicals, such as, for example, the<br>
natural phospholipids DOPC and DOPE, all DOTAP salts are very sensi-<br>
tive to oxidation. However, the oxidation products of unsaturated fatty<br>
acid derivatives generally have high toxicity.<br>
Suitable preparation and purification methods are required here. DOTAP<br>
acetate, for example, is in the form of a high-boiling oil and industrially<br>
can therefore only be obtained with great difficulty in adequate quality.<br>
The conventional methods of overcoming the instability, such as, for ex-<br>
ample, the addition of antioxidants in the form of ascorbic acid or reduced<br>
L-glutathione, greatly restrict the general usability of DOTAP chloride<br>
since interactions with the active compounds to be embedded later can-<br>
not be excluded. Complete exclusion of oxygen during the preparation,<br>
storage and use is virtually impossible or can only be facilitated with very<br>
great effort.<br>
DOTAP chloride is commercially available only as a chloroform solution<br>
or as an amorphous solid.<br>
In addition to its oxidation sensitivity, amorphous DOTAP chloride is also<br>
extremely hygroscopic and deliquesces within an extremely short time at<br>
normal atmospheric humidity levels to give a greasy film. This makes<br>
handling of this compound much more difficult.<br>
Thus, the manufacturer of amorphous DOTAP chloride generally recom-<br>
mends storage under protective gas at -20°C and only guarantees a shelf<br>
life of about 6 months.<br>
The literature only reveals various synthetic routes for the preparation of<br>
amorphous, racemic DOTAP chloride:<br>
Eibel and Unger, DE4013632A1, outline the synthesis of DOTAP chloride<br>
from DOTAP bromide by ion exchange in the chloro-<br>
form/methanol/aqueous HCI solvent system followed by purification by<br>
means of chromatography. DOTAP bromide is obtained in advance in<br>
situ from 1-bromo-2,3-dioleoyloxypropane.<br><br>
WO 2006/056312	PCT/EP2005/011874<br>
-5-<br>
Leventis and Silvius, Biochim. Biophys. Acta, 1023 (1990) 124-132,<br>
report on the synthesis of DOTAP chloride from DOTAP iodide by ion<br>
exchange in the two-phase solvent/NaCI solution system. DOTAP iodide<br>
is obtained in advance by methylation of the corresponding dimethyl-<br>
amino compound by means of methyl iodide.<br>
Nantz et al., Biochim. Biophys. Acta, 1299 (1996) 281-283, J. Med.<br>
Chem. 40 (1997) 4069-4078, describe the synthesis of DOTAP chloride<br>
by non-aqueous ion exchanger chromatography. The desired compound<br>
is obtained by evaporation of the eluate.<br>
Feigner et al., US 5,264,618, carry out the methylation of the correspond-<br>
ing dimethylamino compound directly to DOTAP chloride by means of<br>
methyl chloride. They apparently obtain a yellow wax by crystallisation<br>
from acetonitrile at -20°C. However, DOTAP chloride is virtually insoluble<br>
in acetonitrile at room temperature. Attempts to reproduce this so-called<br>
crystallisation gave only amorphous material through solidification of the<br>
oily substance obtained from hot solution on cooling. The fact that this is<br>
not a crystallisation is also evident from the fact that the authors appar-<br>
ently do not achieve a purification effect and have to purify the substance<br>
by chromatography.<br>
Consequently, neither synthetic routes for the preparation of the two<br>
enantiomeric DOTAP chlorides nor characteristic properties thereof are<br>
known to date. Although Chemical Abstracts has assigned numbers for<br>
the two enantiomers, the corresponding publications describe exclusively<br>
work with racemic DOTAP chloride.<br>
In particular if the compounds are intended for parenteral use, a prepara-<br>
tion which includes treatment with ion exchanger resin is extremely<br>
problematical in view of possible microbiological contamination, since<br>
corresponding resins are an ideal nutrient medium for bacteria and even<br>
after they have been killed, a risk of contamination by endotoxins still<br>
remains.<br><br>
WO 2006/056312	PCT/EP2005/011874<br>
-6-<br>
The object of the present invention is therefore to provide DOTAP chlo-<br>
ride salts and hydrates in high purity and with adequate chemical and<br>
physical stability. A further object of the present invention is to provide<br>
these salts with long shelf lives, enabling them to be used for the prepa-<br>
ration of pharmaceutical formulations. There continues to be a great<br>
demand for a reproducible process for the preparation of stable forms of<br>
DOTAP chloride salts and hydrates which can be carried out on an<br>
industrial scale.<br>
Enantiomerically pure DOTAP chloride can be obtained from enantio-<br>
merically pure starting materials analogously to the processes described<br>
for the racemate, i.e.<br>
via (R or S)-1-chloro-2,3-dioleoyloxypropane,<br>
via (R or S)-1-LG-2,3-dioleoyloxypropane and ion exchange (LG=leaving<br>
group) or via (R or S)-1-dimethylamino-2,3-dioleoyloxypropane.<br>
A further preparation method which may be mentioned is racemate reso-<br>
lution of racemic DOTAP chloride.<br>
By means of experiments, it has now been found, surprisingly, that both<br>
racemic and also enantiomerically pure, crystalline DOTAP chloride can<br>
be obtained in a simple manner with high chemical purity and excellent<br>
stability. The crystalline products obtained in this way have virtually<br>
unlimited stability at room temperature under protective gas. They are<br>
therefore suitable as constituent or as starting material for the prepara-<br>
tion of medicament forms.<br>
The present invention accordingly relates to enantiomerically pure<br>
DOTAP chloride and stable crystal modifications of racemic and enantio-<br>
merically pure DOTAP chloride.<br>
The stable crystal modifications can be in crystalline and partially crystal-<br>
line form. They have a never hitherto achieved purity of &gt; 98% together<br>
with a never hitherto achieved stability of &gt; 98% in relation to the starting<br>
value after storage for 12 months with exclusion of air at 25°C and 60%<br>
relative atmospheric humidity, (see in this respect Table 1). The DOTAP<br><br>
WO 2006/056312	PCT/EP2005/011874<br>
-7-<br>
chloride crystal modifications have a content of less than 1 equivalent of<br>
water or solvent of crystallisation per equivalent of DOTAP chloride.<br>
The racemic DOTAP chloride crystal modifications exist, for example, in<br>
three different crystal modifications (type I, type II, and type III) and ex-<br>
hibit moderately sharp bands in powder X-ray diffraction measurements<br>
(see in this respect Fig. 1 to Fig. 3 and Table 2).<br>
Selected 2 theta values for the various crystal modifications are 12.6,<br>
19.5, 20.2, 21.5 and 25.2 (type I); or 3.3, 4.9, 19.3, 20.0 and 23.5<br>
(type II); or 2.8, 5.8, 20.0, 21.2 and 25.1 (type III).<br>
Enantiomerically pure DOTAP chlorides are likewise obtained in crystal-<br>
line form. Selected 2 theta values for the crystal modification found are<br>
12.8, 19.4, 19.8, 20.2, and 21.5 (type IV, see in this respect Fig. 4).<br>
The enantiomers are optically active. Thus, (2S)-DOTAP chloride has an<br>
optical rotation of-2.12°, (2R)-DOTAP chloride has an optical rotation of<br>
+2.12° ([a]D at 20°C, 1% solution in dichloromethane).<br>
The invention furthermore relates to a process for the preparation of<br>
DOTAP chloride crystal modifications which is characterised in that<br>
DOTAP chloride is crystallised from an aprotic medium. The aprotic<br>
medium used for this purpose can be aprotic solvents or mixtures<br>
thereof.<br>
The aprotic medium may also comprise protic solvents, such as, for<br>
example, water, in small amounts. In exceptional cases, 25% by weight<br>
of protic solvents may also be present under suitable conditions. The<br>
crystallisation of the DOTAP chlorides can be carried out here directly<br>
from the reaction solution without prior purification. Likewise, crystalline<br>
DOTAP chloride can be obtained by recrystallisation of amorphous, par-<br>
tially crystalline or crystalline material.<br>
Suitable aprotic solvents are, in particular,<br>
ethers, such as, for example,    tetrahydrofuran, methyltetrahydrofuran,<br>
dioxane, diethyl ether, dipropyl ether,<br><br>
WO 2006/056312	PCT/EP2005/011874<br>
-8-<br>
diisopropyl ether and methyl tert-butyl<br>
ether,<br>
ketones, such as, for example, acetone and 2-butanone, methyl isobutyl<br>
ketone, methyl isopropyl ketone,<br>
nitriles, such as, for example,    acetonitrile, and<br>
esters, such as, for example,     ethyl formate, methyl acetate, ethyl ace-<br>
tate, propyl acetate, isopropyl acetate,<br>
butyl acetate, isobutyl acetate, dimethyl<br>
carbonate, diethyl carbonate and 1,3-di-<br>
oxolidin-2-one.<br>
These solvents may in each case be used in pure form or in the form of a<br>
mixture, i.e. it is possible both to use the various aprotic solvents in a<br>
group in the form of a mixture and also to employ aprotic solvent types<br>
inn the form of a mixture with one another. As already indicated above,<br>
protic solvent additions may be present in the aprotic solvent or solvent<br>
mixture used.<br>
Protic solvent additions of this type can typically consist of the following<br>
solvents:<br>
alcohols, such as, for example, methanol, ethanol, n-propanol, isopropa-<br>
nol, n-butanol, isobutanol, 2-butanoi, tert-<br>
butanol, 3-methyl-1-butanol and ethylene<br>
glycol, methoxyethanol, ethoxyethanol,<br>
or<br>
water.<br>
The protic solvent additions may in turn be additions of the pure solvents<br>
or of mixtures of these protic solvents.<br>
The crystallisation of the DOTAP chloride modifications is generally<br>
achieved specifically by slow cooling of the prepared solution to tem-<br>
peratures below 30°C. The formation of the crystals is carried out either<br>
spontaneously or by inoculation with the corresponding DOTAP chloride<br>
crystal modification.<br><br>
WO 2006/056312	PCT/EP2005/011874<br>
-9-<br>
The various DOTAP chloride crystal modifications can be converted into<br>
one another. The conversions can be achieved by heat<br>
treatments of the isolated crystal modifications at elevated temperature or<br>
by extended stirring of their suspensions under crystallisation conditions.<br>
The use of amorphous or partially crystalline DOTAP chloride as starting<br>
material for the recrystallisation gives, by the process described, essen-<br>
tially crystalline DOTAP chlorides of never hitherto achieved purity to-<br>
gether with never hitherto achieved stability.<br>
The invention also relates to the use of crystalline DOTAP chlorides for<br>
the preparation of medicament formulations since the crystalline DOTAP<br>
chlorides have excellent stability in solid form under the stated conditions<br>
and have constant and very good quality for a virtually unlimited time.<br>
In addition, enantiomerically pure DOTAP chlorides have different physi-<br>
cal properties to the racemate, in particular in combination with chiral<br>
compounds, such as the phospholipids or cholesterol.<br>
The novel properties found for the enantiomerically pure DOTAP chlo-<br>
rides can advantageously be utilised, alone or in combination with suit-<br>
able phospholipids, cholesterol and derivatives thereof, to provide novel<br>
liposome grades which, compared with conventional forms, on the one<br>
hand represent closer packings of the lipids and on the other hand have<br>
a more uniform structure. Thus, liposomes prepared from the pure<br>
enantiomers exhibit a 5°C higher principal phase transition temperature<br>
compared with the liposomes comprising racemic DOTAP chloride. This<br>
is a measure of the packing density. Liposomes comprising DOTAP<br>
chloride enantiomers therefore also have reduced leaking of the<br>
compound incorporated in them.<br>
This has the consequence that liposomes charged with pharmaceutically<br>
active compounds will release active compounds in a delayed manner in<br>
interaction with the metabolism in the human or animal body. In particu-<br>
lar, sensitive active compounds can thus advantageously be transported<br><br>
WO 2006/056312	PCT/EP2005/011874<br>
- 10-<br>
in a more specific manner to the desired site or organ where the medi-<br>
cament action is desired.<br>
The DOTAP chloride enantiomers also exhibit, in particular in combina-<br>
tion with chiral lipids, such as phospholipids, cholesterol and derivatives<br>
thereof, transfection properties which differ cell-line-specifically.<br>
For the preparation of these novel liposomes, it is possible for the person<br>
skilled in the art specifically to select a form or a certain mixing ratio of<br>
the DOTAP chlorides thus provided in order to prepare liposomes having<br>
certain novel properties.<br>
The invention consequently furthermore also relates to the pharmaceuti-<br>
cal compositions resulting from the use of the DOTAP chloride forms<br>
claimed. Pharmaceutical compositions of this type can comprise the<br>
crystal modifications of (2R,S)-, (2S)- and (2R)-DOTAP chloride together<br>
with other pharmaceutical active compounds and known adjuvants usu-<br>
ally employed in medicament preparation, as well as one or more sol-<br>
vents.<br>
These pharmaceutical compositions can, for example, be in the form of<br>
liposomes, lipoplexes, microemulsions and nanoparticles and include, for<br>
example, an active compound from the group of the peptides, nucleo-<br>
tides, vaccines or cytostatic agents.<br>
The present description enables the person skilled in the art to apply the<br>
invention in a comprehensive manner. In addition, the following examples<br>
serve for better understanding and for illustration of possible variants of<br>
the invention. These examples should therefore in no way be regarded<br>
as restrictive.<br>
All temperatures mentioned in the following examples are indicated in<br>

Stabilities<br>
In order to determine the stability of crystalline DOTAP chlorides, the<br>
substances are stored together with comparative samples at 25°C and<br>
60% relative humidity with exclusion of air. The remaining content of<br>
DOTAP chloride is measured at periodic intervals and quoted in com-<br>
parison to the initial value.<br>
The purity and content of DOTAP chloride are determined by means of<br>
HPLC. For type I, the following values are found:<br>

Crystalline DOTAP chlorides give spectra with moderately sharp bands<br>
which have relatively good resolution for lipids. The spectra indicate high<br>
crystalline contents. No amorphous fractions are visible under the polar-<br>
ising microscope.<br>
Examples of spectra are shown in Fig. 1 (type I), Fig. 2 (type II), Fig. 3<br>
(type III) and Fig. 4 (type IV).<br>

Example 3<br>
Principal phase transition temperatures<br>
Differential scanning caliometry (DSC) measurements are carried out on<br>
multilamellar liposomes in water. Liposomes are prepared by the thin-film<br>
method from the calculated amounts of racemic or enantiomerically pure<br>
DOTAP chloride. The lipid concentration here is in each case 0.1 g/ml.<br>
Suitable amounts of these<br>
dispersions are then introduced into sealable aluminium crucibles and<br><br>
WO 2006/056312	PCT/EP2005/011874<br>
- 13-<br>
measured using a 204 Phoenix calorimeter (Netzsch, Selb, Germany). In<br>
each case, three successive heating/cooling runs from -50°C to +20°C<br>
are carried out at 1°C/min.<br>
For all three DOTAP chloride variants, phase transition temperatures<br>
below 0°C are found. For the cooling cycles, this is in each case at -23°C<br>
to -24°C. Differences between racemic and enantiomerically pure<br>
DOTAP chloride are in each case evident in the heating cycles.<br>
(2R)-DOTAP chloride and (2S)-DOTAP both exhibit an endothermic<br>
phase transition around -12.5°C, while the phase transition for the race-<br>
mate is at -17.5°C (see Fig. 6).<br>
Example 4<br>
Transfection properties on COS-7 cells<br>
Racemic and enantiomerically pure DOTAP chloride and racemic<br>
DOTAP methylsulfate are each dispersed with the same amount of cho-<br>
lesterol in the transfection medium and treated with ultrasound. The lipo-<br>
somes and GFP plasmid solution are mixed and incubated for 15 min-<br>
utes,<br>
amounts per 6well: 2 ug of plasmid/8 ug of lipid.<br>
After incubation for 5 hrs, the supernatant is removed from the cells by<br>
suction at 37°C/5% CO2, 2 ml of fresh medium is added, and the mixture<br>
is incubated for a further 20 hours. After work-up, FACS analysis shows<br>
efficient transfection for all lipoplexes. A significant difference between<br>
the transfection rates for the individual lipid mixtures is evident:<br>
(R)-DOTAP chloride/cholesterol complex:	32.4%<br>
(S)-DOTAP chloride/cholesterol complex:	11.0%<br>
(R,S)-DOTAP chloride/cholesterol complex:	25.9%<br>
(R,S)-DOTAP methylsulfate/cholesterol complex:	20.2%<br><br>
