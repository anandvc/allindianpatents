				<td>CULTIVATED AGARWOOD<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Aganvood is a highly prized incense that is extremely rare, it has at least<br>
a 3000-year history in the Middle East, China and Japan. There are also<br>
references to agarwood in the literature of India and France, and even in the Old<br>
Testament of the Bible. Agarwood remains today the world's most expensive<br>
incense. The value of agarwood shipped out of Singapore alone each year has<br>
been estimated to exceed SI.2 billion. E. Hansen, Saudi Aramco World 51:2-13<br>
(Dec. 2000). This aromatic resinous wood has many common names including<br>
agarwood, gaharu, eaglewood, aloeswood, agila wood, aguru, agar, oud, ude, ud,<br>
ood, oode, jinkoh, jinko, Ch'Lng Kuei Hsiang, Ch'En Hsiang, Chan Hsiang. Chi<br>
Ku Hsiang, Huang Shu Hsiang, kalambak, and grindsanah.<br>
The resin is used by Traditional Chinese, Unanai, Ayuravedic, and<br>
Tibetan physicians. Used medicinally, agarwood is a remedy for nervous<br>
disorders such as neurosis, obsessive behavior, and exhaustion. Agarwood is<br>
highly psychoactive and is used in spiritual rituals. Many religious groups prize<br>
it as a meditation incense, to calm the mind and spirit. In Ayuravedic medicine<br>
it is used to treat a wide range of mental illness and to drive evil spirits away. In<br>
Japan, it is considered by many to be sacred, and is used to anoint the dead. In<br>
Buddhism, it serves as a major ingredient in many incense mixtures, and it is<br>
considered to be one of the three integral incenses, together with sandalwood and<br>
cloves.<br>
The source of agarwood is the Aquilaria tree. The Aquilaria tree is an<br>
evergreen that grows up to 40 meters high and 60 centimeters in diameter. It<br>
bears white flowers that are sweetly scented. The genus Aquilaria is an<br>
angiosperm taxonomically placed in the Thymelaceaceae family. Fifteen<br>
species of Aquilaria have been reported and all produce agarwood. The<br>
taxonomy of these species is not completely clear and not all species are<br>
"recognized by taxonomists. Species include Aquilaria malaccensis, A.<br>
agallocha, A. baillomi, A. crassna, A. hirta, A. rostrata, A. beccariana, A.<br>
cummingiana, A. fdaria, A. khasiana, A. microcarpa, A. grandiflora, A. chinesis<br>
or A. sinensis, A. borneensis, and A. bancana. Aquilaria bancana has been<br>
questioned as a true species of Aquilaria and has been placed in the<br>
Gonystylaceae family of the Gonystylus genus, as Gonystylus bancanus.<br>
Gonystylus has also been found to produce an aromatic resin that is considered<br>
the same as or very similar to agarwood.<br>
Aquilaria trees are native to Asia from Northern India to Vietnam and<br>
Indonesia. The healthy wood of the Aquilaria tree is white, soft, even-grained,<br>
and not scented when freshly cut. Under certain pathological conditions, the<br>
heartwood becomes saturated with resin, and eventually becomes hard to very<br>
hard. The best grade of agarwood is hard, nearly black and sinks when placed in<br>
water. In general, agarwood is considered inferior as it appears lighter in tone,<br>
with diminishing amounts of resin.<br>
The process of agar deposits is not fully understood. A Dutch paper from<br>
1933 (J.P. Schuitemaker, "Het garoehout van West Boreno" Boschbouwkundig<br>
Tijdschrift Tectona Uitgave der Vereeniging van Hoogere Ambtenaren bij het<br>
Boschwezen in Nederlands Oost-Indi 26:851-892) reported the occurrence of<br>
agarwood in Borneo and discussed many different types of resin produced in<br>
trees. Most of the local people at the time believed that agarwood formed from<br>
mysterious ways and was associated with the spirit world. The author stated that<br>
"the mysterious occurrence of the 'holy' wood is connected to supernatural<br>
powers" and that agarwood was referred to as "wood of the gods." The author<br>
also noted that "we cannot exclude the possibility of a pathological occurrence<br>
of which the cause was unknown," that "perfect trees never have agarwood,"<br>
and that agarwood "is formed around wounded or rotting parts of the trunk."<br>
The author also suggested that salt put into holes in trees might promote resin.<br>
The paper also stated that if the agarwood was infectious, maybe it would be<br>
possible to induce agarwood formation by infecting the trunk artificially by<br>
putting fresh cut agarwood into the stem.<br>
Later authors also reported the longstanding belief was that agar deposits<br>
were created as an immune response by the tree, the result of attack by a fungus.<br>
I. H. Burkill, A dictionary of the economic products of the Malay Peninsula. Vol.<br>
I Crown Agents for the Colonies, London p. 197-205. In the 1940's and 1950's,<br>
several researchers investigated the origins of agar deposits with varying and<br>
sometimes conflicting results. Rahman and Basak, Buno Biggyan Patrika 9:87-<br>
93 (1980). Others concluded that it was unlikely that there was a specific fungal<br>
cause for the production of agarwood. Gibson, Bano Biggyan Patrika 6:16-26<br>
(1977). It was suggested that the resin deposits might arise as a direct response<br>
of the stem tissues of the tree to wounds with subsequent invasion by weak<br>
pathogens. Id.<br>
Rahman and Basak suggested that wounding produced color changes in<br>
the wood with some "oleoresin" deposits. Rahman and Basak, Bano Biggyan<br>
Patrika 9:87-93 (1980). They postulated that the presence of an exposed, open<br>
wound seemed to be of more importance than the presence of certain species of<br>
fungi within a wound. They, however, concluded their paper by stating that<br>
further investigation was needed in order to determine what factors were<br>
responsible in wounding, which are important in agar deposition.<br>
The identification of the small proportion of the trees having agar is<br>
difficult and destructive, which added greatly to the near-extinction of natural<br>
stands of tress. Also, large-scale logging operations have destroyed many<br>
forested areas where the Aquilaria trees are found. Thus, the current source of<br>
agarwood, the naturally-growing old-growth Aquilaria trees, is becoming<br>
extinct. To date no one has successfully cultivated agarwood. E. Hansen, Saudi<br>
Aramco World 51:2-13 (Dec. 2000). Therefore, there is a growing need for a<br>
means to cultivate Aquilaria trees that produce agarwood as a renewable source<br>
for agarwood.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
The present invention provides a method of producing agarwood. by<br>
forming an artificial wound into the xylem in an Aquilaria or Gonystylus tree,<br>
and providing a means for aerating the wound. Additional wounds may be<br>
formed either at the same time or after a discolored area has begun forming in<br>
the tree. The wound may be formed by cutting, drilling, or chopping or by<br>
inserting a nail. The wound is formed to reach the xylem. The wound may be<br>
formed to a depth of at least about 1 to 10 cm into the xylem. In one<br>
embodiment the wound is formed to a depth of about 4-6 cm. The wounds may<br>
be made as a series of closely spaced wounds in the tree. For example, the series<br>
of wounds, such as about 30-100 wounds, may be positioned in a spiral up the<br>
tree. The wounds may be positioned at an interval of about 5 cm apart.<br>
In the present method, the aeration means may be an aeration device<br>
inserted into the wound, such as a nail, tube or pipe inserted into the wound. The<br>
aeration device may contain aeration holes in it and/or it may contain grooves on<br>
its exterior surface. The aeration device may be made of plastic, bamboo, wood<br>
or other organic material, or metal, such as iron. It may be about 2 cm in<br>
diameter. When inserted, the aeration device may extend out from the exterior<br>
of the tree, such as about 2 to 15 cm from the exterior of the tree.<br>
Alternatively, the aeration means of the present invention may be a<br>
periodic (e.g., monthly) re-wounding of the wound. This may be by scribing a<br>
patch of cambium around the wound one or more times over the life span of the<br>
tree. It may also be by removing a region of cambium adjoining the wound.<br>
The present method may also involve applying a resin-inducing agent to<br>
cells surrounding the wound. This resin-inducing agent stimulates resin<br>
production in the tree. It may kill live parenchyma cells around the wounded<br>
region of the xylem. The resin-inducing agent may be a chemical agent. If a<br>
chemical agent is used, it may kill cells locally. It can be, for example, sodium<br>
bisulfite, NaCl, ferric chloride, ferrous chloride, chitin, formic acid, cellobiose,<br>
salicyclic acid, iron powder, or yeast extract. In particular, it may be 1:1:3<br>
sodium bisulfite, Difco yeast extract and iron powder. Alternatively, or<br>
additionally, the resin-inducing agent may be an organism, such as an insect or<br>
microbe, such as a fungus (e.g., Deuteromyola sp., Ascomycota sp.,<br>
Basidiomycota sp.).<br>
The tree that is used in the present invention is less than 100 years old,<br>
about 2-80 years old, about 3-20 years old, or even only about 3-12 years old.<br>
The tree used in the present invention is not growing naturally in an old growth<br>
forest. An "old growth forest" is defined herein as a forest that is ecologically<br>
mature and has been subjected to negligible unnatural disturbance such as<br>
logging, roading and clearing. Also included in this definition are ecologically<br>
mature forests where the effects of disturbance are now negligible. In such old<br>
growth forests, the upper stratum or overstory is in the late mature to over-<br>
mature growth phases. Species of trees that can be used in the present invention<br><br>
include, for example, Aquilaria malaccensis, A. agallocha, A. baillonii, A.<br>
crassna, A. hina, A. rostmta, A. beccariana, A. cwnmingiana, A.filaria, A.<br>
khasiana, A. microcarpa, A. grandijlora, A. chinesis or A. sinensis, A.<br>
borneensis, and A. bancana, or Conystylus bancanus.<br>
The present invention also provides agarwood produced by the methods<br>
described above. The present invention further provides agarwood from a tree<br>
grown in a home garden, in a plantation, in a greenhouse, or in agricultural<br>
lands.<br>
The present invention also provides a method of purifying agarwood<br>
resin by providing agarwood produced as described above, and purifying the<br>
resin from the agarwood. The present invention further provides agarwood resin<br>
purified according to this method. The term "resin" is used herein in<br>
conformance with terminology used by those having skill in the art, namely, a<br>
solid to soft-semisolid amorphous fusible flammable substance obtained as a<br>
exudate or as an extract from plants. This term resin includes agarwood oil (or<br>
other form of concentrated agarwood), which is an oil extract containing<br>
resinous substances. Agarwood oil is a thick liquid with dissolved resinous<br>
substances in it that can be obtained from distillation of agarwood, and the<br>
concentration of the aromatic substances. The present invention further provides<br>
concentrated agarwood products made from the agarwood resin produced by the<br>
methods described above.<br>
It should be noted that the indefinite articles "a" and "an" and the definite<br>
article "the" are used in the present application, as is common in patent<br>
applications, to mean one or more unless the context clearly dictates otherwise.<br><br>
Brief Description of the Figures<br>
Figure 1. Schematic drawing of wounded Aquilaria tree at time of<br>
harvest with nothing done to promote agarwood showing internal callus<br>
formation produced by bundles of included phloem cells, and wound closure<br>
from inside the drill wound. Surface cells also produce callus tissue and wound<br>
closure occurs from the outer edge of the drill wound. Little discoloration forms<br>
and insignificant amounts (if any) of agarwood may form in a very thin band<br>
between the discolored wood and the sound, unaltered xylem.<br><br>

between the discolored wood and the sound, unaltered xylem. This area of<br>
agarwood production gets larger and more dense over time.<br>

formed in the new xylem produced after the original wounds are made.<br>
Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
Aquilaria has a unique anatomy, and one who wishes to induce agarwood<br>
in young trees must understand its anatomy. Unlike most trees in the<br>
Angiospemae that produce phloem cells external to the xylem (growing out from<br>
the circumference of the cambium), Aquilaria produces bundles of phloem cells<br>
throughout the xylem as well as in a layer external to the xylem. This means that<br>
the xylem (consisting of vessels, fibers and parenchyma cells) also contains<br>
groups of phloem cells called included phloem or interxlyary phloem of the<br>
diffuse (foraminate) type. When trees are wounded they respond by forming<br>
new wood cells by the cambium. These cells differentiate and close the wound<br>
with newly produced cells (Blanchette R.A. 1992. Anatomical responses of<br>
xylem to injury and invasion by fungi. In: Defense Mechanisms of Woody Plants<br>
Against Fungi. Edited by R.A. Blanchette and A.R. Biggs. Springer-Verlag<br>
Berlin. Pp. 76-95). Once the wound is closed, aeration to the affected wood<br>
stops and internal processes needing air cease. Most trees close wounds by<br>
producing new cells at the edge of the wounded cambium. Aquilaria trees close<br>
wound from inside the xylem as well as externally.<br>
The present experiments have shown that the cambium of Aquilaria trees<br>
reacts to wounding by producing new cells all around the wound and even on the<br>
surface of the wound. See Figure 1. Phloem cells apparently produce new<br><br>
cambial cells that produce new differentiated wood cells. Wound closure occurs<br>
rapidly. Phloem bundles on the surface of the exposed xylem produce secondary<br>
cambial cells that produce new cells to seal and close the wound. Large surface<br>
wounds do not close by only producing callus at the edge of the wounds (like<br>
most trees) instead the entire surface of the exposed xylem produces new<br>
cambial cells, which in turn differentiate, producing new wood cells that close<br>
the wound.<br>
Although wounding has been suggested to cause agarwood, the typical<br>
types of wounds that are produced in trees produce no agarwood. If artificial<br>
wounds are made into the xylem by boring into the tree, the included phloem<br>
present throughout the wounded site reacts and may produce new cambial cells.<br>
New wood formed from this new cambium will gTow within the wounded<br>
xylem. This seals and closes the internal wound. Aquilaria trees with internal<br>
wounds can seal and close wounds from the inside of the trees as well as along<br>
the wounded surface of the exterior surfaces of the tree. The present<br>
experiments show that wound closure stops agarwood formation.<br>
The literature has suggested that fungi growing in the wounded Aquilaria<br>
tree may cause agarwood formation. Different types of fungi have been<br>
suggested including Phialophora parasitica, Torula sp., Aspergillus sp.,<br>
Penicillium sp., Fusarium sp., Cladosporium sp., Epicoccum granulalum,<br>
Cylunndrocladium, Sphaeropsis sp., Botryodiplodia theobromae, Trichoderma<br>
sp., Phomopsis sp., and Cunninghamella echinulata. With all of these fungi<br>
suggested as a possible cause and no clear definitive research to show that a<br>
fungus is responsible for agarwood to form, researchers have indicated "that<br>
agaru arises from a much more generalized cause than previously invisaged"<br>
(Gibson, Barto Biggyan Putrika 6:16-26 (1977)). Punithalingam and Gibson,<br>
Nova Hedwigia 29:251-255 (1978) report a new species of Phomopsis from<br>
Aquilaria but indicate "no evidence was obtained to show that this fungus was<br>
the cause of the formation of agaru." In a paper by Rahman and Basak (Bano<br>
Biggyan Putrika 9:87-93 (1980)) on "Agarwood production in agar tree by<br>
artificial inoculation and wounding" after experiments to produce agarwood they<br>
concluded, "More experimental work needs to be done before the generation of<br>
agar deposit is fully understood. There is no doubt that we are still far from the<br><br>
development of techniques which would provide an assured supply of agar<br>
products." The paper by Rao and Dayal {International Association of Wood<br>
Anatomist Bulletin N.S.. 13:163-172 (1992)) discusses the formation of<br>
agarwood and provides microscopic views of affected wood from naturally<br>
growing trees with agarwood. They conclude by suggesting that "it is important<br>
to study factors such as tree age, within-tree seasonal variation in<br>
responsiveness, and environmental variation" to determine how agarwood is<br>
formed. Research by the present inventors has shown that tree age is not<br>
important (planted young trees not growing naturally in a forest can produce<br>
agarwood) and agarwood has been produced in trees at three different<br>
geographical locations in Vietnam showing variation in the environment is not a<br>
critical factor.<br>
Agarwood is a resinous wood substance that is produced by the tree as a<br>
nonspecific host response to wounding, insects and/or microbial invasion. The<br>
resin contains tree extractives that have aromatic terpenes present. As discussed<br>
above, Aquilaria is unique in that it produces phloem bundles within the xylem.<br>
This network of phloem and parenchyma cells produce and distribute the resin<br>
around affected areas as a tree defense reaction. It was previously thought that<br>
only old trees could produce resin.<br>
The present inventors have determined how agarwood forms in nature<br>
and have used this information to produce agarwood in young cultivated<br>
Aquilaria trees. The trees may be grown, for example, in a home or cooperative<br>
garden, on a plantation, or in a greenhouse. The present technique for producing<br>
agarwood has been used on young plantation-grown trees, about 3 to 8 years old.<br>
The technique can be performed on trees that are older than this, although for<br>
economic reasons, it is beneficial to use younger trees. The inventors have<br>
found that two factors are needed in order to induce the production of agarwood<br>
in Aquilaria trees: (I) an open wound in the tree, and (2) this open wound must<br>
be aerated.<br>
Trees are wounded with a drill to make a hole into the xylem. Many<br>
types of wounds were tried and a hole that cuts across the xylem is needed. The<br>
size of the hole is not important. Of prime importance is that the hole must not<br>
be closed by callus tissue. Small drill wounds may close by new wood growth<br><br>
within one year in fast-growing tropical trees. To insure that the wound does not<br>
close, a region of cambium can be cut around the drill wound. This removes the<br>
cambium and delays callus formation and wound closure. This process needs to<br>
be done repeatedly if the wound appears to be closing. Another method is to<br>
insert a sturdy plastic, bamboo, wood or other organic material, or metal tube or<br>
pipe (with holes made all along the sides of the tube) into the drill wound<br>
leaving it protruding out of the tree. See Figures 2A and 2B. As the tree grows,<br>
the tube prevents the tree from closing the wound. These and any other methods<br>
to prevent wound closure can be used.<br>
In order to maximize agarwood production, one can disturb the tree cells<br>
that line the hole after the hole is made. It was seen that the more disruption of<br>
live cells, the greater the internal area where agarwood formed. If a hole is<br>
drilled, agarwood forms only around the edge of the wound (and only while<br>
aeration occurs). If a drill wound is made and substances that kill some of the<br>
tree cells (resin-inducing agents) are introduced, the resin forms over a much<br>
larger area. See Figure 3. Many different resin-inducing substances can be<br>
used, such as NaCl, ferric chloride, ferrous chloride, chitin, formic acid, etc.<br>
Also microbes can be inoculated into the tree to induce a more intense host<br>
response. Species of fungi, taxonomically from the Deuleromycota,<br>
Ascomycota and Basidiomycota groups that were isolated from agarwood<br>
columns in old growth trees growing in Viet Nam were inoculated into the test<br>
trees. The presence of some fungi may help keep the wound open and disrupt<br>
live cells of the tree, therefore acting as an inducing agent. The sesquiterpenes<br>
produced in agarwood from naturally occurring resin in old growth trees and in<br>
young plantation-grown trees were chemically analyzed, and the resin was the<br>
same.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, the method would include a series<br>
of drill wounds made in a spiral up the tree (30 to 100+ per tree). Each wound is<br>
separated by a short interval. Each wound receives a tube, such as a plastic tube,<br>
with many holes in its walls. The tube is inserted into the drill wound and left to<br>
extend out from the tree 2 to 15 cm. The tube would also contain an inducing<br>
agent. Another method would be to drill holes that are spiraled up the tree and<br>
the inducing agent is added directly into the wounds. Each wound would be<br><br>
scribed to cut away a patch of cambium around the hole. The wounds would be<br>
inspected over time and new scribing and/or drilling used to keep the hole open.<br>
Trees may be grown in nature or in greenhouses for agarwood production.<br>
The following examples are intended to illustrate but not limit the invention.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
Trees, approximately 4-5 years old, growing in plantations in An Giang<br>
Province or Phu Quoc Island, Vietnam were used for experiments 1 to 8.<br>
Example 1<br>
Trees were wounded by making six ax wounds into the main trunk on<br>
each tree. Trees harvested after six months were cut and split through the<br>
wounded area. The area of discoloration was measured on the exposed<br>
longitudinal plane. Resin formation (agarwood) occurred (if it occurred) in a<br>
small zone between the wounded, discolored wood and the live unaltered wood.<br>
After 6 months, the mean area of discoloration of six ax wounds was 6.1 cm2<br>
ranging from 1.6 to 9.1 cm2 and no distinct area of resin formation was seen.<br>
After 21 months, the mean area of six ax wounds was 0.3 cm2 ranging from 0.0<br>
to 1.5cm and no resin was apparent. The results from this study show that<br>
wounding trees with an ax and making shallow surface wounds does not produce<br>
agarwood.<br>
Example 2<br>
Trees were wounded with a 5/8 inch drill to a depth of approximated 5<br>
cm. Six wounds were made in a spiral fashion on the trunk of the tree<br>
approximately 20 cm apart. One of the six wounds served as a control and the<br>
other 5 wounds were filled with agarwood (approximately 0.5 g per wound)<br>
from a tree in the forest with naturally produced agarwood. This tree had been<br>
cut by poachers but some parts of the tree remained and some fresh agarwood<br>
was obtained from it. Small sections of the agarwood were cut and put into the<br>
drill wounds. After 6 and 18 months trees were harvested and evaluated with the<br>
following results.<br>
After 6 months<br>
Wound Treatment Area of discoloration<br>
1 Control 11.7<br>
2 agarwood 27.6<br>
3 agarwood 22.1<br>
4 agarwood 15.6<br>
5 agarwood 12.6<br>
6 agarwood 16.0<br>
After 18 months<br>
WoundTreatment Area of discoloration<br>
1 Control 18.4<br>
2 agarwood 16.9<br>
3 agarwood 18.8<br>
4 agarwood 19.1<br>
5 agarwood 15.1<br>
6 agarwood 17.6<br>
The amount of discoloration was somewhat greater than when ax wounds<br>
were used and a very small region of what appeared to be resin was found at the<br>
interface between discolored wood and sound wood. However, trees rapidly<br>
closed and the agarwood formation process did not progress as seen in the<br>
relatively small areas of discoloration present after 18 months.<br>
Example 3<br>
Trees were wounded with a 5/8 inch drill to a depth of approximated 5<br>
cm. Six wounds were made in a spiral fashion on the trunk of the tree<br>
approximately 20 cm apart. One of the six wounds served as a control and the<br>
other 5 wounds were inoculated with pure cultures of fungi isolated from fresh<br>
agarwood obtained from natural forests in Vietnam. Five different fungi,<br>
representing different species of Ascomyota and Deuteromycota, were used.<br>
The genus and species was not determined but culture morphology indicated<br>
each fungus represented different genera. Only cultures proving to be successful<br>
11<br>
for stimulating agarwood were to be identified to species after field data was<br>
obtained. Fungi were grown on sterile oats supplemented with malt extract broth<br>
for added nutrients. Cultures were grown for 3 weeks on the oat/malt extract<br>
substrate. Drill wounds inoculated with the fungi were filled with the fungus/oat<br>
inoculum. After 6, 18 and 21 months the trees were harvested and the following<br>
results were obtained.<br>
The results indicate that the common fungi associated with fresh<br>
agarwood in Vietnam did not significantly stimulate agarwood to form. The area<br>
of discoloration and intermediate area of very slight amounts of resin production<br>
was similar between the non-inoculated drill wounds and wounds receiving pure<br>
cultures of fungi. No significant increases in agarwood production occurred<br>
over the three harvest dates.<br>
Example 4<br>
Trees were wounded with a 5/8 inch drill to a depth of approximated 5<br>
cm. Six wounds were made in a spiral fashion on the trunk of each tree<br>
approximately 20 cm apart. Two of the six wounds served as controls and the<br>
other 4 wounds were inoculated with different types of nutrient growth media<br>
(used to culture microorganisms in the laboratory) or soil.<br>
Treatments included:<br>
— Control no treatment<br>
— Difco Malt Extract (ME) approximately 0.1 g added per wound<br>
— Difco mycological agar (MYCO) approximately 0.1g added per wound<br>
— Difco yeast extract (YE) approximately O.lg added per wound<br>
-- Soil approximately 0.25 grams of soil from the plantation where the<br>
tree was growing was added per wound<br>
These results indicate that no inducement of agarwood was found when<br>
just nutrients used to grow fungi in culture were used. Soil placed into the drill<br>
wound also did not stimulate agarwood formation. All wounds had evidence of<br>
wound closure from surface cambium cells and the included phloem cells of the<br>
xylem produced new cells to close the wounds from within the drill hole.<br>
Example 5<br>
To test if different types of compounds could stimulate agarwood<br>
production, 5/8 inch drill wounds were made approximately 5 cm into the main<br>
trunk of young plantation trees and different materials used to treat the drill<br>
wounds. Chemicals used were from Sigma Chemicals Inc. St. Louis, Missouri<br>
or Mallinckrodt Inc. Paris, Kentucky. One drill wound per tree received no<br>
treatment and others received one of the following treatments:<br>
Chitosan - purified chitin approximately 0.2g of chitin was added per<br>
wound<br>
Formic acid - approximately 0.1g of formic acid was added per wound<br>
Sodium chloride - approximately 0.2 g added per wound<br>
Cellobiose - approximately 0.2 grams added per wound<br>
Lime - approximately 0.1 g calcium carbonate added per wound<br>
Trees were harvested after 12, 18 and 21 months.<br>
These results indicate that the reaction area within a tree and area of<br>
discoloration can be increased with compounds that kill live parenchyma cells<br>
around the wounded region of the xylem. Deposits of agarwood resin were<br>
formed at the edges of the discolored regions. Substances like formic acid that<br>
have a low pH and NaCl that has a high pH both can disrupt live cells and induce<br>
greater amounts of agarwood than the control wounds. As the tree grows and<br><br>
wounds are closed the affected area decreases. Other substances like chitosan,<br>
cellobiose and lime do not increase the area of discoloration within the tree at the<br>
concentrations tested. However, if added at amounts that are detrimental to live<br>
cells adjacent to the wounded area it did have an effect. Microscopic<br>
observations indicate that the cells around wounds treated with NaCl or formic<br>
acid react extensively and phloem cells are filled with resin. These cells do not<br>
have the ability to produce cambial initial cells and wound closure is delayed.<br>
Substances that affect the live parenchyma cells and phloem cells in the xylem<br>
stimulate resin production and induce agarwood production. They also inhibit<br>
wound closure from the outer cambium as well as new cells formed by the<br>
included phloem.<br>
Example 6<br>
Analysis of the chemical composition of natural agarwood and<br>
experimentally produced agarwood was done by identification of the<br>
sesquiterpenes present. Samples were extracted in methylene dichloride at<br>
37.5°C and nitrogen used to reduce the volume to no less than 0.1 ml. A<br>
methylating agent was added before injecting into a Hewlett-Packard 5890 gas<br>
chromatograph with a 15m x 0.25mm DB-1 column. The injector temperature<br>
was 280°C. After four minutes the initial column temperature of 50°C was<br>
raised at 10C/min to 340°C. The eluent was detected with a Hewlett-Packard<br>
5972 mass selective detector with the interface at 280 ºC.<br>
Samples of low, medium and high quality agarwood obtained<br>
commercially from Singapore merchants had levels of sesquiterpenes that ranged<br>
from 0.3 to 10% of the sample. Sesquiterpenes included, aromadendrene, ß-<br>
selinene, ?-cadinene, a- and ß-guaiene. The levels of sesquiteqtenes from<br>
samples of agarwood from the experimental trees were at 0% (control wounds)<br>
to 1.5% (NaCl treated drill wound treatment after 12 months). Sesquiterpenes<br>
included aromadendrene, ß-selinene, y-cadinene, a- and ß-guaiene and a-<br>
humulene.<br>
Example 7<br>
Multiple, small drill wounds were made at three locations on each tree to<br>
observe the effect of wound size and multiple wounds on agarwood formation.<br>
Twenty holes approximately 5 mm in diameter were drilled approximately 5 cm<br>
into the xylem of the tree. Four rows of five wounds were made approximately<br>
2 cm apart. Groups of wounds were made at 30 cm intervals on different sides<br>
of the tree. A 10x10 cm area of the bark was cut out around each group of 20<br>
wounds. Trees were harvested after 18 months. The area of discoloration<br>
caused by the small drill wounds coalesced together resulting in a large area of<br>
discoloration with some agarwood resin formed along the edges. The multiple<br>
wounds served to disrupt normal functioning of cells around the wounds and<br>
wound closure was delayed. Single small drill wounds made in a tree would not<br>
produce significant amounts of agarwood resin since they would close rapidly,<br>
but groups of multiple wounds made closely together on the tree disrupted the<br>
normal functioning of the xylem and stimulated agarwood production.<br>
Example 8<br>
Fourteen plantation grown trees on Phu Quoc Island were used to test<br>
different treatments. Each tree received 8 wounds that were spiraled up the main<br>
trunk of the tree separated by approximately 20 cm. A range of different types<br>
of wounds and treatments as well as controls were made on each tree. Each<br>
treatment was made at a different location on each tree to insure that location of<br>
wound did not have an effect. Trees were harvested after 15 months and taken to<br>
the laboratory for analyses.<br>
Treatments included:<br>
1. A surface wound approximately 5 x 5 cm was made by cutting<br>
the bark and removing the bark tissue to expose the xylem. No<br>
drill hole was made.<br>
2. A 5/8 inch drill wound was made approximately 5 cm into the<br>
xylem.<br>
3. A 5/8 inch drill wound was made approximately 5 cm into the<br>
xylem and a 5 x 5 cm section of the bark removed around the drill hole<br>
and approximately 0.3 g sterile Aquilaria sawdust added to the drill<br>
wound.<br>
4. Same as #3 but with approximately 0.3g of a 1:1 ratio of ferrous<br>
chloride and sterile Aquilaria sawdust added to the drill wound.<br>
5. Same as #3 with approximately 0.3g of a 1:2 ratio of NaCl and<br>
sterile Aquilaria sawdust added to the drill wound.<br>
6. Same as #3 but with approximately 0.3g of a 1:4 ratio of Difco<br>
yeast extract and sterile Aquilaria sawdust.<br>
7. Same as #3 but with approximately 0.3g of a 1:1 ratio of sodium<br>
bisulfite and sterile Aquilaria sawdust.<br>
8. Same as #3 but with approximately 0.3g of a 1:2:4 ratio of Difco<br>
nutrient broth: Difco malt extract: sterile Aquilaria sawdust.<br>
After 15 months, 8 trees were harvested and brought to the laboratory for<br>
analyses. The area of discoloration and resin formation was determined by<br>
splitting the tree through the wounded region and area affected measured using<br>
an image analyzer. Area (cm ) was determined for all wounds in the<br>
longitudinal plane. Each value is a mean of 8 wounds.<br><br>
This study showed the effectiveness of several treatments for the<br>
production of appreciable amounts of agarwood in young Aquilaria trees.<br>
Surface wounds do not produce agarwood. Deep penetrating wounds may<br>
produce some agarwood as long as the wound site remains open. Compounds<br>
that challenge the living ceils around the drill wounds in the xylem (e.g. NaCl,<br>
sodium bisulfite, ferrous chloride, and any other chemicals that disrupt the<br>
normal functioning of living tree cells) increase the area of discoloration within<br>
the tree and the amount of agarwood resin formed.<br>
Example 9<br>
Young trees growing at two sites, in home gardens and on agricultural<br>
land (Kon Turn, Vietnam and Nui Cam, Vietnam), received 8 wounds per tree.<br>
Drill wounds 5/8 inch diameter were drilled approximately 5 cm into the main<br>
trunk of each tree in a spiral fashion separated by approximately 20 cm. All drill<br>
wounds were scribed to remove a 5x5 cm area of bark around the wound.<br>
Fungal treatments consisted of three different types of Basidiomycota obtained<br>
from Aquilaria trees in Vietnam. These isolates were not identified to genus but<br>
culture morphology indicated they were different genera. Cultures were grown<br>
on sterile rice supplemented with malt extract. Cultures were grown for three<br>
weeks before inoculation.<br>
Treatments included:<br>
1. Control wound receiving sterile rice<br>
2. Fungal culture 97-14-5<br>
3. Fungal culture 97-13-7<br>
4. Fungal culture 97-11-25<br>
5. Control wound receiving 5g sterile Aquilaria sawdust<br>
6. Approximately 0.5g of a 1:4 ratio of sodium bisulfite and sterile<br>
Aquilaria sawdust<br>
7. Approximately 0.5g of a 1:2 ratio of salicylic acid in sterile<br>
Aquilaria sawdust<br>
8. Approximately 0.5g of a 1:4 ratio of ferrous chloride in sterile<br>
Aquilaria sawdust<br>
After 15 months two trees were harvested from each location and brought<br>
to the laboratory for analyses. The mean area for each type of wound was<br>
calculated.<br>
This study indicated that the three different basidiomycetous fungi used<br>
did not result in extremely large areas of discoloration and the area was not very<br>
different from control wounds. It also indicated that the reduced concentration<br>
of sodium bisulfite used in comparison to example 8 caused a reduced amount of<br>
discoloration and agarwood resin. Although less area of discoloration was found,<br>
agarwood resin did form at the discolored/sound wound interface. When this<br>
wood was removed from around the wound and burned it produced a distinctive<br>
agarwood aroma. Some compounds such as salicylic acid and ferrous chloride<br>
did not produce large areas of discoloration and apparently must be applied in<br>
sufficient concentration to affect the living cells in the xylem adjacent to the drill<br>
wound. For example, in this experiment ferrous chloride was used in a 1:4<br><br>
ration with sawdust and moderate amounts of discoloration were observed. In<br>
previous experiments it was used in a 1:1 ratio with greater amounts of reaction<br>
and agarwood production in the wounded xylem.<br>
Example 10<br>
Iron nails placed into the experimental trees showed a small but<br>
significant amount of agarwood when harvested after 6, 15, or 18 months.<br>
Reactions observed in the xylem indicate that iron stimulates resin production<br>
and iron nails or other sources of iron affect agarwood formation.<br>
Example 11<br>
Young trees 5-6 years old growing at two locations, Nui Cam and Kon<br>
Turn, Vietnam, were wounded by making 5/8 inch drill wounds into the xylem<br>
to a depth of approximately 5.0 cm. Wounds were placed in a spiral up the tree<br>
separated by approximately 10 cm. A 5x5 cm area of bark was removed from<br>
around the wound and a plastic tube inserted into the wound. The plastic tube<br>
had aeration holes drilled into the sides and shallow grooves made into its<br>
surface to facilitate air movement along the tube when inserted into the tree (sec<br>
Figure 3). The tube extended out from the tree approximately 10 cm so the hole<br>
will not close for m3ny years. This tube will insure that the wound will stay<br>
open and air will be available to the inner wounded xylem. In addition to<br>
wounds receiving only the tubes, other wounds with tubes inserted had a<br>
combination of 1:1:3 sodium bisulfite, Difco yeast extract and iron powder<br>
added (the iron powder was a 99.6% Fe powder manufactured by J.T. Baker Inc.<br>
Phillipsburg, NJ). Other compounds that cause a localized disruption of the<br>
normal functioning of xylem and phloem cells can also be used to prevent<br>
internal included phloem from producing secondary cells (that could close the<br>
wound from the inside of the drill wound) and to disrupt a greater area of cells in<br>
the xylem. As long as the wound remains open to the air, agarwood will<br>
progressively accumulate. The greater the disruption of live cells around the<br>
wound (without killing the tree) the greater the agarwood production. The tree<br>
must remain alive for agarwood to form, as dead trees do not form agarwood.<br>
As the tree grew new wood, additional holes were made to allow the zone of<br>
agarwood to move into the new xylem (Figure 4).<br>
Example 12<br>
Trees located in two locations, Nui Cam and Kon Turn, Vietnam, were<br>
wounded using a 5/8 inch drill to a depth of approximately 5 cm. Wounds were<br>
placed in a spiral fashion on the tree from the ground line up into the crown.<br>
Wounds were placed 3 to 5 cm apart. Over time, the wounds were rewounded to<br>
keep the wounds open. This was done whenever the wounds appeared to have<br>
any wound closure. In these areas of Vietnam they were checked and<br>
rewounded every 2-3 months. Trees were wounded with 30 to 70 wounds<br>
depending on the size of the tree. These studies show that repeated mechanical<br>
wounds that are made deep into the xylem kept the wounds open by preventing<br>
external cambial wound closure and internal secondary cell growth by the<br>
included phloem. Localized areas of agarwood accumulated immediately<br>
adjacent to the wound as long as the wound remained open.<br>
