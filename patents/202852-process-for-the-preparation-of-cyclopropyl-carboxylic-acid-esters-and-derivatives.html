 This exampl illustrates a method of preparing trans-(1R,2S)-2-(3,4-difluorophenyl)cyclopropanaminium (2R)-2-hydroxy-2-phenylethanoate.<br>
R-(-)-Mandelic acid (2.26 kg) was added to a solution containing trans-(1R,2S)-2-(3,4-difiuorophenyl)cyclopropylamine (2.6 kg, 91.8% enantiomeric excess), stirring at 17°C in ethyl acetate (45.3 L). The mixture was stirred at 25oC for 3 hours and 8 minutes, then filtered and washed twice with ethyl acetate (13.8 kg total). The crystalline product was dried at 40°C under reduced pressure for 23 hours, affording trans-(lR,2S)-2-(3,4-difluorophenyl)cyclopropanaminium (2R)-2-hydroxy-2-phenylethanoate (4.45 kg).<br><br>

contacting compound of formula (II)<br><br>
in which R and Y area as defined above, with the dimethylsulfoxonium methylide in the presence of a solvent at a temperature of -10°C-90°C.<br>
2.       A process as claimed in claim 1<br><br>
wherein: R is phenyl substituted with one or more halogen; and Y is OR1, where R1 is a straight chain alkyl, branched alkyl, cycloalkyl, or a substituted bicycloheptyl group; which comprises:<br><br>
group; which comprises: chlorinating a compound of formula (III)<br><br>
by reaction with a chlorinating agent in the presence of an inert solvent and a catalyst at a temperature of 0-200°C; and then reacting the resulting solution with YH or Y-, where Y is as claimed in claim 1, at an elevated temperature to provide a compound of formula (II):<br><br>
reacting a trimethylsulfoxonium salt with a solid metal hydroxide in dimethyl sulfoxide at ambient or an elevated temperature to produce dimethylsulfoxonium methylide; and,<br>
contacting the compound of formula (II) with the dimethylsulfoxonium methylide in the presence of a solvent at a temperature of -10°C-90°C.<br>
3.	A process as claimed in claim 1 or 2, in which the metal hydroxide is sodium hydroxide.<br>
4.	A process as claimed in claim 1 in which a compound of formula (III) is reacted with thionyl chloride in the presence of an inert solvent and pyridine at a temperature of 0-200°C, and the resulting solution is then reacted with YH or Y-, where Y is as claimed in claim 1, at an elevated temperature.<br><br>
5.	A process as claimed in any one of the preceding claims in which YH represents L-menthol.<br>
6.	A process as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 5 in which a compound of formula (III) is prepared by contacting a compound of formula (IV):<br><br>
where R is as claimed in claim 1, with malonic acid in the presence of pyridine and piperidine at elevated temperature.<br>
7.	A process as claimed in any one of the preceding claims in which R is phenyl substituted by one or more fluorine atoms.<br>
8.	A process as claimed in claim 7, in which R is 3,4-difluorophenyl.<br>
9.	A process as claimed in any one of the preceding claims in which Y is chiral.<br>
10.	A process as claimed in claim 9 in which Y is L-menthoxy.<br>
11.	A process as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 10 in which a compound of formula (I) is resolved to yield a compound of formula (Ia):<br><br><br>
where R and Y are as defined above, by a crystallization or chromatographic method.<br>
12. A process as claimed in claim 11 in which the resolution is carried out by extracting a compound of formula (I) into heptane and then effecting crystallisaiton from the heptane extracts.<br>
