The present invention relates to a security closure for botties and the like.<br>
Although these known closures are advantageous from many points of view,<br>
they have a recognized disadvantage which,  up to now,  has not been<br>
overcome.<br>
In fact, after a non-authorized opening of the bottle, a   person can, with<br>
patience and dexterity,   reassemble  the  security band  so that  it adopts<br>
practically the same  starting  position.     This may mislead  a  subsequent<br>
purchaser who does not notice that the closure has been tampered vvith.<br>
The problem upon which the present invention is based is that of devising a<br>
closure   of   the   type   specified   which   has   structural   and   functional<br>
characteristics such as to overcome the disadvantage identified above.<br>
This problem is solved  by a  security  closure  according to  the  present<br>
invention.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a security closure for bottles and<br>
the like, of the type comprising a pouter body, a cylindrical sleeve having an<br>
internal rim for retaining the pourer body, a cap, a threaded coupling between<br>
the cap and the pourer body for the unscrewing and screwing of the cap, and a<br>
security band  comprising a ring   which is fixed to the cap   by means of a<br>
weakened line, external teeth being formed on the cylindrical sleeve   and<br>
opposing internal teeth being formed on the ring, for engaging the teeth when<br>
the cap is first unscrewed, characterized in that the ring is divided into at least<br>
two portions and the external teeth are formed in a recess  in the -cylindrical<br>
sleeve defined by a sloping shoulder.<br>
Further characteristics  and  advantages  of the  closure  according  to  the<br>
invention will become clear irom the following description of a preferred<br>
embodiment thereof which is given by way of non-limiting example with<br>
reference to the accompanying drawings, in which :<br>
Figure 1 is a partially-sectioned view of a closure.<br><br>
according to the invention with parts removed,<br>
Figure 2 is a section through the closure of Figure 1,<br>
Figure 3 a section through a detail of the closure of Figure 2, taken on the line III-III,<br>
Figure 4 is a view of the closure of Figure 1 at another stage of its operation.<br>
With reference to the appended drawings, a security closure, generally indicated 1, is intended for a bottle, not shown, particularly for good-quality liqueurs.<br>
The closure 1 comprises a pourer body 2, a cylindrical sleeve 3, a cap 4 and a security band 5, which are joined together coaxially along an axis X-X.<br>
The pourer body 2 comprises an internal obturator valve, generally indicated 6, for preventing refilling of the bottle and has an outer flange 7 and an external thread 8.<br>
The cylindrical sleeve 3 comprises an upper end 9 on which there is an internal rim 10 which overlaps the flange 7, as well as an outer recess defined by a sloping shoulder 3a. The cylindrical sleeve 3 has an internal annular lip  12 and axial projections  13 which are<br>
  a groove and channels respectively provided in the bottle in order to fix the sleeve firmly to the bottle axially and with regard to rotation.<br>
The sleeve 3 in turn holds the _pourer body 2 on the bottle axially by the engagement of the rim 10 on the flange 7.   A frontal coupling with teeth 14 is formed<br><br>
between the flange 7 and the rim 10 to fix the pourer body 2 with regard to rotation relative to the cylindrical sleeve 3, and thus to the bottle.<br>
The cap 4 has external knurling 15 and an internal thread 16 which, with the external thread 8, constitutes a threaded coupling 17 for the screwing of the cap onto the. pourer body and its unscrewing therefrom, according to need.<br>
In particular, the cap 4 comprises an inner cap 18 and an outer cap 19 which is fitted onto the inner cap 18.<br>
Connection means 20 are formed between the inner cap	18,<br>
which has the internal thread 16, and the outer cap	19,<br>
which has the outer knurling 15, in order to fix	the<br>
inner cap and the outer cap together.<br>
In particular, the connection means comprise external collars 21 on the inner cap and internal annular projections 22 on the outer cap, which are snap-engaged one above another to form a coupling 23 in order to fix the inner cap and the outer cap together axially.<br>
In order to fix the inner cap and the outer cap with regard to rotation relative to one another, external axial splines 24 on the inner cap and internal axial splines 25 in the outer cap form a splined coupling.<br>
The splines 24 and 25 are pointed with respective lead-in tips 24a and 25a for guiding the outer cap onto the inner cap in accordance with a predetermined angular pitch upon fitting.       <br>
It should be noted that the inner cap 18 is fixed to the<br><br>
cylindrical sleeve 3 by means of a weakened line 27, the weakened line being produced by the action of blades after the inner cap and the sleeve have been moulded as a single item.<br>
The security band 5 is formed as a ring 28 which is fixed to the outer cap 18 by means  of a weakened line 29.<br>
The ring 28 is substantially housed in the recess 11 and is substantially in contact with the sloping shoulder 3a.<br>
The ring 28 is divided into two structurally independent, identical, semicircular portions 30 and 31 by means of two diametrally-opposed cuts 32.<br>
The weakened line 29 and the two cuts 32 are produced by the action of blades after the outer cap and the ring have been moulded as a single piece.<br>
A plurality of external teeth 33, twenty-four teeth in the embodiment shown, is formed on the cylindrical sleeve 3 in the recess 11. A plurality of opposing teeth 34, twelve teeth in the embodiment shown, is formed inside the ring 28 for engaging the teeth 33 when the cap is first unscrewed.<br>
The teeth 33 and the opposing teeth 34 are intercalated with a predetermined pitch conforming to the   pitch of the coupling of the splines 24 and 25 of the splined coupling 26 upon fitting.<br>
The teeth 33 and the opposing teeth 34 have sawtooth-like profiles with faces indicated 33a and 34a, respectively. The faces 33a of the teeth 33 are inclined rearwardly at an angle A, whereas the faces 34a of the opposing teeth<br><br>
34 are inclined forwardly at an angle B,- with reference to the sense in which the cap is unscrewed.<br>
The angles of inclination A and B have a predetermined value selected between 5° and 25" and in the embodiment shown are 15°.<br>
The closure 1 according to the invention is assembled with all its parts as a unit which can be handled individually and is intended to be fitted on a bottle as such.<br>
When the cap 4 is first unscrewed, first of all, the weakened line 27 between the inner cap and the cylindrical sleeve tears; the unscrewing then starts and continues until the opposing teeth 34 engage the teeth 33, face to face. The ring 28 is thus restrained against any further rotation by the cylindrical sleeve. If the unscrewing action is continued, the weakened line 29 tears. At this point, the ring 28 is separated from the outer cap 19 and breaks up into the two portions 30 and 31 into which it is divided. The portions fall due to their own weight, sliding on the sloping shoulder 3a. They leave their initial positions for ever and, owing to gravity, can no longer be replaced or remain there.<br>
The inclinations of the faces of the teeth and of the opposing teeth prevent both a situation in which the two portions 30 and 31 into which the ring is divided are urged radially outwardly without tearing of the weakened line and with the teeth being overlapped by the opposing teeth, and a situation in which the two portions 30 and 31 are drawn radially inwardly with tearing of the weakened line but with the teeth firmly engaging the opposinQ teeth.<br><br>
The predetermined inclinations of the faces of the teeth and of the opposing teeth simultaneously ensure both the tearing of the weakened line and the separation of the two portions into which the ring is divided.<br>
The main advantage of the closure according to the present invention lies in the particularly unmistakeable manner in which any unauthorized opening becomes apparent, by virtue of the fact that it is impossible to reassemble the security ring.<br>
A further advantage of the closure according to the invention lies in its structural simplicity which is one of the most important advantages for an article which has to be produced on a very large scale.<br>
Naturally, an expert in the art may apply many modifications and variations to the closure according to the invention in order to satisfy contingent and specific requirements, all within the scope of protection of the invention as defined by the following claims.<br><br><br>
