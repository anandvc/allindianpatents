In order to produce the snacks according to this, it is required to use pre-gelatinized flours. The 10 flavored pellet undergoes a baking process at a high temperature during a short period of time. An internally flavored snack is produced, to which it is possible to add functional ingredients which would degrade using a normal extrusion process.</td>

3.	PREAMBLE OF THE DESCRIPTION:-<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br>
METHOD FOR THE PRODUCTION OF INTEGRALLY FLAVORED, NON FRIED<br>
SNACKS.<br>
Invention Field<br>
5 	This invention refers to a method for the production of non-fried snacks, namely, a method for preparing non-fried snacks which are integrally flavored. This invention also refers to non-fried snacks which are integrally flavored.<br>
10<br>
Prior Art<br>
At present, several processes for producing fried and non-fried snacks are known. It is common in the food industry  that  snacks  are  prepared  with  starch  in  a<br>
15 	particular way. The resultant dough is cut and dried so that it may be then fried. The results of the above are snacks with high-fat rate.<br>
For example, US Patent No. 6,432,463, disclosing a process  to  produce  expandable  pellets,   specifically<br>
20 	discloses the production of potato based expandable pellets by using a twin screw extruder, which improves the flavor quality and increases the oil absorption. One of the differences between the present invention and the above<br>
2<br><br>
mentioned invention is that this invention uses a single-screw extruder for the pellet production. Hence, no oil absorption is done by the product from the present invention. Furthermore, the flavor of this invention is <br>
5  	included within the composition of the snack.<br>
Another document which discloses a method for snack production, is US Patent No. 3,971,859 titled "Technique for preparing edible food flavor pellets" which discloses the manufacture of pellets which are fried in peanut oil<br>
10 	and coated with a flavored ingredient. The differences between this invention and the invention above mentioned are evident, since the snacks of this invention are non-fried and are internally flavored.<br>
US Patent No. 3,857,977 titled "Food Flavor Pellets<br>
15 	with wheat flour, soy flour and buttermilk base" discloses the production of a pellet or cube which is submitted to an extrusion process at high temperature and high pressure. Said patent is different from the present invention, since the process herein does not use fat components, and uses a<br>
20  low temperature and low pressure extrusion process.<br>
In addition, another document disclosing a process for the production of snacks is US Patent No. 3,851,072 titled "Food flavor pellets with meat texture" which discloses a<br>
3<br><br>
method and a composition for the preparation of cubes or pellets with a meat-like texture to be then incorporated into dehydrated food systems. The products of the above patent are extruded at high temperatures and high pressure <br>
5 	in a determined time, to obtain products with a desired size and length. As was above mentioned, the present invention is not submitted to extrusion high temperatures nor high pressures.<br>
US Patent No. 6,881,429 titled: "Method of extruding<br>
10 		bread dough and products thereof" was also found, wherein a method of manufacturing an uncooked dough product by a cold-extrusion process not exceeding 60°C is disclosed. The most significant difference between the above US patent and this invention is the type of baking, since the above<br>
15 		US patent refers to a normal baking process, i.e., in a conventional oven; the baking in the present invention, is carried out by a device through which the intermediate product is impelled by a driver element, such as a screw, which  allows  the  flow of  hot  air,  causing  that  the<br>
20	intermediate product actuates as a boiling solid, suffering a thermal shock caused by the sudden evaporation of the water,  resulting in a non-bubble texture, with randomly<br>
4<br><br>
bonded gaps providing as a result a thicker product than the already-known snacks.<br>
		US Patent application No. 60/139,928 titled: "System of Food Delivery, Preparation and Consumption", refers to a <br>
5 	system and method to deliver, prepare and consume semi-prepared products, which expand by an energetic source such as a microwave oven. The products are manufactured based on cereals, to produce cereals for breakfast or snacks. The method and product of the above mentioned application <br>
10 	differ from the present invention since this invention 	refers to a ready-to-eat (RTE) product.<br>
		Therefore, a product using a low-temperature and low-pressure extrusion process is desirable, resulting into a low fat product. <br>
15 			Additionally, a process to manufacture snacks, wherein the process is carried out by a low-temperature and low-pressure extrusion, resulting into a low fat product is also desirable.<br>
Hence,  an object of this invention is a method of <br>
20  producing low-fat or non-fat snack products.<br>
Another object of the invention, is a low-temperature and low-pressure extrusion process.<br>
5<br><br>
Also, another object of the invention is a method of making a snack product, wherein the snack product flavor arises from the snack composition.<br>
A further object of this invention is that the method <br>
5  	for producing the snack product leaves the product as a RTE product.<br>
Another object of this invention is a snack which is low-fat or non-fat.<br>
Another object of the invention is a snack product, <br>
10  produced by a low temperature and low pressure extrusion     	process.<br>
Furthermore,  another object of the invention is a snack product, where the snack product flavor arises from the snack composition. <br>
15	Yet another object of the present invention is a RTE 	snack. <br>

Detailed Description of the Invention.<br>
10 			This invention refers to a method for making an integrally flavored, non-fried snack, as well as the composition thereof, using natural materials which undergo a soft thermal process to maintain the food value thereof and  retain  the  flavor  added  to  the  composition.<br>
15 Furthermore, the present invention refers to integrally flavored non-fried snacks, from natural materials, wherein the materials undergo a soft thermal processes to maintain the snack nutritive value and retain the snack flavor.<br>
It should be understood as "integrally flavored", that<br>
20  the snack is flavored in the outer and inner surface.<br>
The main element of these snacks in comparison to those of prior art, is the low-fat level and vegetal fiber provision thereof, retaining an excellent flavor product.<br>
7<br><br>
	Figure 1 is an acceptance comparative test graph of two extruded and integrally flavored products, wherein one of the products was obtained by a normal extrusion process, while the other was obtained by the process of the present <br>
5 	invention. Said figure shows the acceptance of the product by means of the method of the present invention. In said figure it may be seen that the snack of the present invention has greater acceptance since the flavor retention is higher in the process of this invention.<br>
10 			Figure 2 is an amplified microscope photography of the surface of the snack produced by the method of the present invention in which it may be seen that the surface includes few air bubbles, and wherein the surface does not contain oil.<br>
15 			Figure 3 is an amplified microscope photography of the interior of the snack made by the method of the present invention, in which the flavor particles may be observed. As in Figure 2, it may be seen from the present figure that few air bubbles are contained in the snack as well as the<br>
20  lack of oil in the snack.<br>
Figure 4 is an amplified microscope photography of the surface of a snack extruded with the prior art process, by means of high pressure and temperature, wherein the snack<br>
8<br><br>
is a spicy snack. In this figure it may be seen that the surface is covered by oil. Also, it may be seen that the texture of the texture of the surface is different from that of the snack produced by the method of the present <br>
5 	invention, since said surface contains air bubbles and abundant oil. The surfaces may be compared by observing this figure versus Figure 2.<br>
Figure 5 is an amplified microscope photography of a cross section of the snack extruded by the prior art <br>
10 	process, by means of high pressure and temperature, wherein 	the snack is a spicy snack. In this figure it may be seen 	that the interior surface of the prior art snack, contains air bubbles and is covered by oil, resulting in a different texture from that of the snack of the present invention, as<br>
15  it may be seen when comparing Figure 5 with Figure 3.<br>
Figures 2 and 5 show different characteristics of snacks obtained by a cold extrusion process and by a hot extrusion process.<br>
Figure 2 shows the front part of the snack of the<br>
20  present invention, which is obtained by a cold extrusion<br>
process, baked and flavored. This figure shows that the<br>
   snack does not shine, which is typical in oil-fried snacks.<br>
  The small granules which may be seen are characteristic of<br>
9<br><br>
the sugar and powder flavoring. On the other hand, Figure 4 shows the surface of a prior art snack, i.e., a fried snack. Figure 4 it also shows red-yellow dots a characteristic pertaining to the spicy flavoring. <br>
5 		Figure 3 shows the internal part of the cold-extruded, baked and seasoned snack. Said figure shows that the product contains few bubbles and is fat-free. On the contrary, Figure 5 shows the internal part of the hot-extruded, fried and seasoned snack. As it may be observed<br>
10 		from Figure 5, the prior art snack contains shiny air bubbles; also in the edges of said prior art snack, the spicy condiment particles may be seen.<br>
In prior art, upon the addition of flavors and water, the  formation of dough previous  to the  hot extrusion<br>
15 		process is caused, and further causing when extruding in pressures (higher than 100 bar) and temperatures (higher than 100°C) generated within the extrusion chamber, that the flavors and scents of the extruded product to evaporate and/or degrade and/or alter.<br>
20			The snack of the present invention is made by means of the unique process of the present invention. The snack of this invention includes pre-gelatinized flours, so the process may be carried out by cold extrusion. The cold<br>
10<br><br>
extrusion is carried out by a single screw extruder with a cooling water jacket, a machine commonly used to produce pastas. The use of this machine for the snack of this invention has the advantage of not using temperatures <br>
5 	higher than 100°C in the internal part of the product, so that the scents and flavors of the ingredients are not degraded and/or altered, which are commonly transformed with high temperature.<br>
The snack of the present invention includes originally<br>
10 chosen natural ingredients such as pre-gelatinized rice flour, Nixtamalized corn flour, sodium chloride, bicarbonate, sugar, oats fiber and soy flour, ascorbic acid, etc, as well as additives such as natural and/or artificial flavorings.<br>
15 			The cold-extrusion process necessarily uses pre-gelatinized flours.<br>
The manufacturing method of the integrally flavored non-fried snacks of this invention includes the following steps:<br>
20 			1. Mixing the necessary ingredients, with an exact weight relation to obtain a desired taste, until obtaining an homogenous mixture, wherein the mixture may be carried<br>
11<br><br>
out with a mixer at a speed of 20 to 60 rpm, during a determined period of time between 5 to 10 minutes;<br>
2.	Adding water to achieve a humidity of between 10%<br>
and 55% to obtain the desired conditions of the texture of<br>
5  the final product;<br>
3.	Mixing the initial composition with water, until<br>
these two are homogenized, wherein the second mixture may<br>
be carried out with a mixer at a speed of 20 to 60 rpm,<br>
during  a  determined period  of  time  between  5  and  10<br>
10  minutes, or until achieving a non-dry flour, wherein the result of this mixture is an homogenous flour;<br>
4.	Pouring the resulting homogenous flour into an<br>
extrusion chute;<br>
5.	Cold  extruding  the  homogenous  flour  into  an<br>
15  extruder, wherein said extruder is a single screw extruder<br>
with a cooling water jacket,  obtaining a  humid solid product;<br>
6.	Cutting the humid solid product,  wherein said<br>
cutting may be done manually or by a pasta industrial<br>
20  cutter.<br>
7.	Placing the resulting cut humid solid product on<br>
the trayses of a drier;<br>
12<br><br>
8.	Placing the trays in the drier, during a<br>
determined time, to reduce humidity between 5% and 20%, the<br>
time being variable and depending on the amount of the<br>
resulting  product  to  be  dried,   thus  obtaining  an<br>
5  intermediate product;<br>
9.	Carefully taking out the trays and separating the dry product;<br>
10.	Baking the resulting intermediate product at a high temperature during a short time, the temperature may<br>
10 vary between 150 to 250 °C whilst the time may vary between 1 to 18 minutes depending on the amount the product to be baked, where the baking step is carried out by a means of a device through which the intermediate product is impelled by an impelling element,  such as a screw.  Said device<br>
15 allows the flow of air, i.e. the entrance and exit of hot air. The entrance and exit of hot air is generated in different ways, for example, by the combination of a blower and a heat source, originating that the intermediate product acts as a boiling solid, which suffers a thermal<br>
20 shock causing the sudden evaporation of the water within the product giving a texture with few to none bubbles, with randomly bonded gaps resulting in a thicker product;<br>
13<br><br>
11. Optionally flavoring with seasons the baked product, with one or several flavors to intensify the flavor and packing the resulting product.<br>
	Figure 6, shows in a detailed manner the production of <br>
5  said dry homogenous flour by a flow chart,  showing the steps         	to obtain the dry homogenous flour.<br>
The characteristics of the described process allow obtaining a product of the integrally flavored non-fried snack  of  the  present  invention,  with  different  food<br>
10 	properties to those of the fried product and with different sensorial properties, such as texture, taste and scent. Additionally, the product is cheaper since it is not extruded at high temperatures. Finally, the product obtained from the process is a calorie and fat reduced<br>
15 	snack, in comparison to the prior art oil-fried products, and achieving a better flavor retention in comparison to a product obtained by a hot extrusion process. Another advantage of the obtained product is that it has a longer shelf life, since it does not contain oil, which oxides<br>
20  easily.<br>
14<br><br>
Composition Examples.<br>
Several examples of the different compositions of the<br>
integrally  flavored  non-fried  snack  of  the  present<br>
invention are disclosed below. According to the above, the<br>
5  snack of the present invention varies in a great number of<br>
flavors, since the flavor of the base is neutral. The above<br>
also  causes  a  great  number  of  possible  functional<br>
properties to exist.<br>

The above-mentioned examples show that pre-gelatinized <br>
5 	flours occupy a substantial portion of the mixture. Pre-  	gelatinized flours are usually divided into corn pre-gelatinized flours and rice pre-gelatinized flours. However, rice pre-gelatinized flour may be substituted by any pre-gelatinized cereal, pre-gelatinized tubercle or <br>
10 		pre-gelatinized leguminous. These ingredients occupy a 	considerable portion of the snack composition since the mixture is previously submitted through a gelatinization<br>
23<br><br>
process, so that the role of the flour native starch is gelatinizing.<br>
The gelatinization process requires submitting the native flours to a gelatinization thermal process. Said <br>
5 	gelatinization is due to the starch from the flours. The above results in an excellent raw material to extrude by-means of a cold extrusion process. Therefore, temperatures higher than 100°C are avoided, and hence, flavors incorporated to the dough are retained before said dough is<br>

15 			The results from the sensorial evaluation of the samples produced in a Wenger X5® extruder and those obtained from a cold-extrusion process in a Montferrina® are herein shown. The sensorial tests were carried out with 30  individuals,  of both,  female  and male  sexes,  with<br>
20  oscillatory ages between 22 and 24 years old.<br>
The object of the test is observing the cold-extrusion process and hot-extrusion process effect, in regards to the<br>
24<br><br>
flavor incorporated to the flour mixture,  prior to the process thereof.<br>
The process conditions are as follows:<br>
I)	The cold-extrusion process was carried out without <br>
5	thermal treatment.<br>
II)	The hot-extrusion process was carried out with a<br>
single-screw Wenger X-5® extruder,  according to Table I:<br>

ABSTRACT OF THE INVENTION<br>
		This invention refers to a method for producing integrally flavored non-fried snacks, as well as the preparation thereof, in which upon internally flavoring the <br>
5	pellet, flavors prevail, since a cold-extrusion process similar to that used for producing pastes is used, wherein the temperature does not exceed 100°C, thereby flavors degrades not. In order to produce the snacks according to this, it is required to use pre-gelatinized flours. The <br>
10 	flavored pellet undergoes a baking process at a high temperature during a short period of time. An internally flavored snack is produced, to which it is possible to add functional ingredients which would degrade using a normal extrusion process.<br>
