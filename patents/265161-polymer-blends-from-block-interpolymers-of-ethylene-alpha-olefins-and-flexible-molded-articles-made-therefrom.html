POLYMER BLENDS FROM INTERPOLYMERS OF ETHYLENE/a-OLEFINS AND FLEXIBLE MOLDED ARTICLES MADE THEREFROM<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[1]	This invention relates to polymer blends comprising at least one<br>
ethylene/a-olefin interpolymer and at least one polyolefin, methods of making the blends, and molded products made from the blends.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[2]	The manufacture of durable goods in the United States alone accounts<br>
for millions of tons of plastics consumption annually. Durable goods are manufactured products capable of long utility which are found in various markets such as the automotive, construction, medical, food and beverage, electrical, appliance, business machine, and consumer markets. Some applications in these markets require the uses of flexible polymers or polymer blends. These applications include, but are not limited to, toys, grips, soft touch handles, bumper rub strips, floorings, auto floor mats, wheels, casters, furniture and appliance feet, tags, seals, gaskets such as static and dynamic gaskets, automotive doors, bumper fascia, grill components, rocker panels, hoses, linings, office supplies, seals, liners, diaphragms, tubes, lids, stoppers, plunger tips, delivery systems, kitchen wares, shoes, shoe bladders and shoe soles.<br>
[3]	For used in durable goods applications, polymers or polymer blends are<br>
desired to possess good processibility (e.g., moldability), appealing appearance (e.g., clear or colorable), suitable surface properties (e.g., good adhesion to substrates, rubber-like feel, non-stickiness and good paintability), and a good combination of mechanical properties (e.g., flexibility, heat resistance, abrasion and/or scratch resistance, toughness, tensile strength, and compression set). Some polymers that possess suitable properties for durable goods include flexible polyvinylchloride (f-PVC), poly(styrene-butadiene-styrene) (SBS), poly(styrene-ethylene/butadiene-styrene) (SEBS), thermoplastic vulcanizates (TPV), thermoplastic poly(urethane) (TPU), and polyolefins such as polyolefin homopolymers and polyoelfin interpolymers.<br>
[41	Some polyolefins such as polypropylene (PP) and low density<br>
polyethylene (LDPE) have found wide acceptance for use in durable goods applications<br><br>
for their ease of molding, good heat resistance and mechanical properties. Furthermore, many formulations based on blends of polyolefins and other polymers have been developed to meet the demands required by the production of parts of durable goods. For example, a blend of polypropylene and polyethylene can be used to manufacture fibers for artificial turf applications.<br>
[5]	Further, some flexible polymers including some polyolefin<br>
homopolymers or polyoelfin interpolymers may be tacky, which is an undesirable property in some processes or applications. In general, additives such as fatty acid amides, waxes or other non-tacky polymers can be mixed with such flexible polymers to reduce their tackiness. However, such additives are only effective to some degree and are known to have some undesirable properties of their own.<br>
[6]	Despite the availability of a variety of polyolefins and their blends, there<br>
exists a continuing need for new polymers or new polymer blends that have improved properties and performance characteristics.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[7]	The aforementioned needs are met by various aspects of the inventions.<br>
In one aspect, the invention relates to a polymer blend comprising at least one ethylene/a-olefin interpolymer and one or more additional polymers. The additional polymers can be polyolefin, styrenic block copolymer, polyvinylchloride, thermoplastic polyurethane, etc.. In one embodiment, the ethylene/a-olefin interpolymer has a Mw/Mn from about 1.7 to about 3.5, at least one melting point, Tm, in degrees Celsius, and a density, d, in grams/cubic centimeter, wherein the numerical values of Tm and d correspond to the relationship:<br>

AT &gt; -0.1299(AH) + 62.81 for AH greater than zero and up to 130 J/g,<br>
AT &gt; 48°C for AH greater than 130 J/g ,<br>
wherein the CRYSTAF peak is determined using at least 5 percent of the cumulative polymer, and if less than 5 percent of the polymer has an identifiable CRYSTAF peak, then the CRYSTAF temperature is 30°C.<br>
[9] In another embodiment, the ethylene/a-olefin interpolymer is characterized by an elastic recovery, Re, in percent at 300 percent strain and 1 cycle measured with a compression-molded film of the ethylene/a-olefin interpolymer, and has a density, d, in grams/cubic centimeter, wherein the numerical values of Re and d satisfy the following relationship when the ethylene/a-olefin interpolymer is substantially free of a cross-linked phase:<br>
Re&gt;1481-1629(d).<br>
[I]	In another embodiment, the ethylene/a-olefin interpolymer has a molecular<br>
fraction which elutes between 40°C and 130°C when fractionated using TREF,<br>
characterized in that the fraction has a molar comonomer content of at least 5 percent<br>
higher than that of a comparable random ethylene interpolymer fraction eluting<br>
between the same temperatures, wherein said comparable random ethylene<br>
interpolymer has the same comonomer(s) and has a melt index, density, and molar<br>
comonomer content (based on the whole polymer) within 10 percent of that of the<br>
ethylene/a-olefin interpolymer.<br>
[II)	In another embodiment, the ethylene/a-olefin interpolymer is<br>
characterized by a storage modulus at 25°C, G'(25°C), and a storage modulus at 100°C,<br>
G'OOOX), wherein the ratio of G'(25°C) to G*(100°C) is from about 1:1 to about 10:1.<br>
[121	1° another embodiment, the ethylene/a-olefin interpolymer has at least<br>
one molecular fraction which elutes between 40°C and 130°C when fractionated using TREF, characterized in that the fraction has a block index of at least 0.5 and up to about 1 and a molecular weight distribution, Mw/Mn, greater than about 1.3. In another embodiment, the ethylene/a-olefin interpolymer has an average block index greater than zero and up to about 1.0 and a molecular weight distribution, Mw/Mn, greater than about 1.3.<br><br>
[13]	In another embodiment, the a-olefin in the ethylene/a-oiefin<br>
interpolymeris styrene, propylene, 1-butene, 1-hexene, 1-octene, 4-methyM-pentene, norbomene, 1-decene, 1,5-hexadiene, or a combination thereof.<br>
[14]	In another embodiment, the ethylene/a-olefin interpolymer is present in<br>
the range from about 5% to about 95% by weight of the total composition.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
General Definitions<br>
[28J	"Polymer" means a polymeric compound prepared by polymerizing<br>
monomers, whether of the same or a different type. The generic term "polymer" embraces the terms "homopolymer," "copolymer," "terpolymer" as well as "interpolymer."<br>
[29]	"Interpolymer" means a polymer prepared by the polymerization of at least<br>
two different types of monomers. The generic term "interpolymer" includes the term "copolymer" (which is usually employed to refer to a polymer prepared from two different monomers) as well as the term "terpolymer" (which is usually employed to refer to a polymer<br><br>
prepared from three different types of monomers). It also encompasses polymers made by polymerizing four or more types of monomers.<br>
[1]	The term "ethylene/a-olefin interpolymer" generally refers to polymers<br>
comprising ethylene and an a -olefin having 3 or more carbon atoms. Preferably, ethylene comprises the majority mole fraction of the whole polymer, i.e., ethylene comprises at least about 50 mole percent of the whole polymer. More preferably ethylene comprises at least about 60 mole percent, at least about 70 mole percent, or at least about 80 mole percent, with the substantial remainder of the whole polymer comprising at least one other comonomer that is preferably an a-olefin having 3 or more carbon atoms. For many ethylene/octene copolymers, the preferred composition comprises an ethylene content greater than about 80 mole percent of the whole polymer and an octene content of from about 10 to about 15, preferably from about 15 to about 20 mole percent of the whole polymer. In some embodiments, the ethylene/a-olefin interpolymers do not include those produced in low yields or in a minor amount or as a by-product of a chemical process. While the ethylene/a-olefin interpolymers can be blended with one or more polymers, the as-produced ethylene/a-olefin interpolymers are substantially pure and often comprise a major component of the reaction product of a polymerization process.<br>
[31]	The ethylene/a-olefin interpolymers comprise ethylene and one or more<br>
copolymerizable a-olefin comonomers in polymerized form, characterized by multiple blocks or segments of two or more polymerized monomer units differing in chemical or physical properties. That is, the ethylene/a-olefin interpolymers are block interpolymers, preferably multi-block interpolymers or copolymers. The terms "interpolymer" and copolymer" are used interchangeably herein. In some embodiments, the multi-block copolymer can be represented by the following formula:<br>
(AB)n where n is at least I, preferably an integer greater than 1, such as 2, 3,4, 5,10, 15, 20, 30,40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90,100, or higher, "A" represents a hard block or segment and "B" represents a soft block or segment. Preferably, As and Bs are linked in a substantially linear fashion, as opposed to a substantially branched or substantially star-shaped fashion. In other embodiments, A blocks and B blocks are randomly distributed along the polymer chain. In other words, the block copolymers usually do not have a structure as follows.<br>
AAA—AA-BBB—BB<br><br>
In still other embodiments, the block copolymers do not usually have a third type of block, which comprises different comonomer(s). In yet other embodiments, each of block A and block B has monomers or comonomers substantially randomly distributed within the block. In other words, neither block A nor block B comprises two or more sub-segments (or sub-blocks) of distinct composition, such as a tip segment, which has a substantially different composition than the rest of the block.<br>
[32]	The multi-block polymers typically comprise various amounts of "hard" and<br>
"soft" segments. "Hard" segments refer to blocks of polymerized units in which ethylene is present in an amount greater than about 95 weight percent, and preferably greater than about 98 weight percent based on the weight of the polymer. In other words, the comonomer content (content of monomers other than ethylene) in the hard segments is less than about 5 weight percent, and preferably less than about 2 weight percent based on the weight of the polymer. In some embodiments, the hard segments comprises all or substantially all ethylene. "Soft" segments, on the other hand, refer to blocks of polymerized units in which the comonomer content (content of monomers other than ethylene) is greater than about 5 weight percent, preferably greater than about 8 weight percent, greater than about 10 weight percent, or greater than about 15 weight percent based on the weight of the polymer. In some embodiments, the comonomer content in the soft segments can be greater than about 20 weight percent, greater than about 25 weight percent, greater than about 30 weight percent, greater than about 35 weight percent, greater than about 40 weight percent, greater than about 45 weight percent, greater than about 50 weight percent, or greater than about 60 weight percent.<br>
[1]	The soft segments can often be present in a block interpolymer from about 1<br>
weight percent to about 99 weight percent of the total weight of the block interpolymer, preferably from about 5 weight percent to about 95 weight percent, from about 10 weight percent to about 90 weight percent, from about 15 weight percent to about 85 weight percent, from about 20 weight percent to about 80 weight percent, from about 25 weight percent to about 75 weight percent, from about 30 weight percent to about 70 weight percent, from about 35 weight percent to about 65 weight percent, from about 40 weight percent to about 60 weight percent, or from about 45 weight percent to about 55 weight percent of the total weight of the block interpolymer. Conversely, the hard segments can be present in similar ranges. The soft segment weight percentage and the hard segment weight percentage can be calculated based on data obtained from DSC or NMR. Such methods and calculations are<br><br>
disclosed in a concurrently filed U.S. Patent Application Serial No.	(insert when<br>
known), Attorney Docket No. 385063-999558, entitled "Ethylene/a-Olefin Block Interpolymers", filed on March 15, 2006, in the name of Colin L.P. Shan, Lonnie Hazlitt, et. al. and assigned to Dow Global Technologies Inc., the disclose of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.<br>
[341	The term "crystalline" if employed, refers to a polymer that possesses a first<br>
order transition or crystalline melting point (Tm) as determined by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) or equivalent technique. The term may be used interchangeably with the term "semicrystalline". The term "amorphous" refers to a polymer lacking a crystalline melting point as determined by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) or equivalent technique.<br>
[35J	Tta term "multi-block copolymer" or "segmented copolymer** refers to a<br>
polymer comprising two or more chemically distinct regions or segments (referred to as "blocks") preferably joined in a linear manner, that is, a polymer comprising chemically differentiated units which are joined end-to-end with respect to polymerized ethylenic functionality, rather than in pendent or grafted fashion. In a preferred embodiment, the blocks differ in the amount or type of comonomer incorporated therein, the density, the amount of crystallinity, the crystallite size attributable to a polymer of such composition, the type or degree of tacticity (isotactic or syndiotactic), regio-regularity or regio-irregularity, the amount of branching, including long chain branching or hyper-branching, the homogeneity, or any other chemical or physical property. The multi-block copolymers are characterized by unique distributions of both polydispersity index (PDI or Mw/Mn), block length distribution, and/or block number distribution due to the unique process making of the copolymers. More specifically, when produced in a continuous process, the polymers desirably possess PDI from 1.7 to 2.9, preferably from 1.8 to 2.5, more preferably from 1.8 to 2.2, and most preferably from 1.8 to 2.1. When produced in a batch or semi-batch process, the polymers possess PDI from 1.0 to 2.9f preferably from 1.3 to 2.5, more preferably from 1.4 to 2.0, and most preferably from 1.4 to 1.8.<br>
[36J	In the following description, all numbers disclosed herein are approximate<br>
values, regardless whether the word "about" or "approximate" is used in connection therewith. They may vary by 1 percent, 2 percent, 5 percent, or, sometimes, 10 to 20 percent. Whenever a numerical range with a lower limit, RL and an upper limit, Ru, is<br><br>
disclosed, any number falling within the range is specifically disclosed. In particular, the following numbers within the range are specifically disclosed: R=RL+k*(Ru-RL), wherein k is a variable ranging from 1 percent to 100 percent with a 1 percent increment, i.e., k is 1 percent, 2 percent, 3 percent, 4 percent, 5 percent,..., 50 percent, 51 percent, 52 percent,..., 95 percent, 96 percent, 97 percent, 98 percent, 99 percent, or 100 percent. Moreover, any numerical range defined by two R numbers as defined in the above is also specifically disclosed.<br>
[1] Embodiments of the invention provide polymer blends comprising at least one ethylene/ct-olefin block interpolymer (to be described below) and one or more polymers, which are different than the ethylene/a-olefin block interpolymer. The additional polymers include, but are not limited to, thermoplastic polymers, elastomers, and rubbers, such as polyolefins, styrenic block copolymers, etc.   The term "different" when referring to two polymers means that the two polymers differ in composition (comonomer type, comonomer content, etc.), structure, property, or a combination of both. For example, a block ethylene/octene copolymer is different than a random ethylene/octene copolymer, even if they have the same amount of comonomers. A block ethylene/octene copolymer is different than an ethylene/butane copolymer, regardless of whether it is a random or block copolymer or whether it has the same comonomer content. Two polyolefins also are considered different if they have a different molecular weight, even though they have the same structure and composition. Moreover, a random homogeneous ethylene/octene copolymer is different than a random heterogenous ethylene/octene copolymer, even if all other parameters may be the same.<br>
[38)	The polymer blends possess unique physical and mechanical properties<br>
that are suitable for making molded articles for a variety of applications. The blends have relatively low modulus, while maintaining relatively high heat resistance. Such balance of properties makes the blends suitable for making flexible molded articles. The molded articles should have an upper use or service temperature of at least 40 °C, at least 50 °C, at least 60 °C, at least 80 °C, or at least 90 °C. The flexural modulus of the blends should be less than 20,000 psi, less than 10,000 psi, less than 5000 psi, less than 1000 psi, less than 500 psi.<br><br>

[39]	The ethylene/a-olefin interpolymers used in embodiments of the invention<br>
(also referred to as "inventive interpolymer" or "inventive polymer") comprise ethylene and one or more copolymerizable a-olefin comonomers in polymerized form, characterized by multiple blocks or segments of two or more polymerized monomer units differing in chemical or physical properties (block interpolymer), preferably a multi-block copolymer. The ethylene/ a-olefin interpolymers are characterized by one or more of the aspects described as follows.<br>
[40]	In one aspect, the ethylene/a-olefin interpolymers used in embodiments of the<br>
invention have a Mw/Mn from about 1.7 to about 3.5 and at least one melting point, Tm, in degrees Celsius and density, d, in grams/cubic centimeter, wherein the numerical values of the variables correspond to the relationship:<br>
Tm &gt; -2002.9 -I- 4538.5(d) - 2422.2(d)2, and preferably Tm &gt; -6288.1 + 13141(d) - 6720.3(d)2, and more preferably Tm &gt; 858.91 - 1825.3(d) + 1112.8(d)2.<br>
[41]	Such melting point/density relationship is illustrated in Figure 1. Unlike the<br>
traditional random copolymers of ethylene/a-olefins whose melting points decrease with decreasing densities, the inventive interpolymers (represented by diamonds) exhibit melting points substantially independent of the density, particularly when density is between about 0.87 g/cc to about 0.95 g/cc. For example, the melting point of such polymers are in the range of about 110 °C to about 130 °C when density ranges from 0.875 g/cc to about 0.945 g/cc. In some embodiments, the melting point of such polymers are in the range of about 115 °C to about 125 °C when density ranges from 0.875 g/cc to about 0.945 g/cc.<br>
[1] In another aspect, the ethylene/a-olefin interpolymers comprise, in polymerized form, ethylene and one or more a-olefins and are characterized by a AT, in degree Celsius, defined as the temperature for the tallest Differential Scanning Calorimetry ("DSC") peak minus the temperature for the tallest Crystallization Analysis Fractionation ("CRYSTAF") peak and a heat of fusion in J/g, AH, and AT and AH satisfy the following relationships: AT &gt; -0.1299(AH) + 62.81, and preferably AT &gt; -0.1299(AH) + 64.38, and more preferably AT &gt;-0.1299(AH) + 65.95, for AH up to 130 J/g. Moreover, AT is equal to or greater than 48 °C for AH greater than 130 J/g. The CRYSTAF peak is determined using at least 5 percent of the cumulative polymer<br><br>
(that is, the peak must represent at least 5 percent of the cumulative polymer), and if less than 5 percent of the polymer has an identifiable CRYSTAF peak, then the CRYSTAF temperature is 30°C, and AH is the numerical value of the heat of fusion in J/g. More preferably, the highest CRYSTAF peak contains at least 10 percent of the cumulative polymer. Figure 2 shows plotted data for inventive polymers as well as comparative examples. Integrated peak areas and peak temperatures are calculated by the computerized drawing program supplied by the instrument maker. The diagonal line shown for the random ethylene octene comparative polymers corresponds to the equation AT = -0.1299 (AH) + 62.81.<br>
[43]	In yet another aspect, the ethylene/a-olefin interpolymers have a molecular<br>
fraction which elutes between 40°C and 130°C when fractionated using Temperature Rising Elution Fractionation ("TREF"), characterized in that said fraction has a molar comonomer content higher, preferably at least 5 percent higher, more preferably at least 10 percent higher, than that of a comparable random ethylene interpolymer fraction eluting between the same temperatures, wherein the comparable random ethylene interpolymer contains the same comonomer(s), and has a melt index, density, and molar comonomer content (based on the whole polymer) within 10 percent of that of the block interpolymer. Preferably, the Mw/Mn of the comparable interpolymer is also within 10 percent of that of the block interpolymer and/or the comparable interpolymer has a total comonomer content within 10 weight percent of that of the block interpolymer.<br>
[1] In still another aspect, the ethylene/a-olefin interpolymers are characterized by an elastic recovery, Re, in percent at 300 percent strain and 1 cycle measured on a compression-molded film of an ethylene/a-olefin interpolymer, and has a density, d, in grams/cubic centimeter, wherein the numerical values of Re and d satisfy the following relationship when ethylene/a-olefin interpolymer is substantially free of a cross-linked phase:<br>
Re &gt;1481-1629(d); and preferably<br>
Re &gt;1491 -1629(d); and more preferably<br>
Re &gt;1501 -1629(d); and even more preferably<br>
Re&gt;1511-1629(d).<br>
[45]	Figure 3 shows the effect of density on elastic recovery for unoriented films<br>
made from certain inventive interpolymers and traditional random copolymers. For the same density, the inventive interpolymers have substantially higher elastic recoveries.<br><br>
[46]	In some embodiments, the ethylene/a-olefin interpolymers have a tensile<br>
strength above 10 MPa, preferably a tensile strength &gt; 11 MPa, more preferably a tensile strength &gt; 13MPa and/or an elongation at break of at least 600 percent, more preferably at least 700 percent, highly preferably at least 800 percent, and most highly preferably at least 900 percent at a crosshead separation rate of 11 cm/minute.<br>
[47]	In other embodiments, the ethylene/a-olefin interpolymers have (1) a storage<br>
modulus ratio, G'(25°C)/G,(100°C), of from 1 to 50, preferably from 1 to 20, more preferably from 1 to 10; and/or (2) a 70°C compression set of less than 80 percent, preferably less than 70 percent, especially less than 60 percent, less than 50 percent, or less than 40 percent, down to a compression set of 0 percent.<br>
[1] In still other embodiments, the ethylene/a-olefin interpolymers have a 70°C compression set of less than 80 percent, less than 70 percent, less than 60 percent, or less than 50 percent Preferably, the 70°C compression set of the interpolymers is less than 40 percent, less than 30 percent, less than 20 percent, and may go down to about 0 percent.<br>
[49]	In some embodiments, the ethylene/a-olefin interpolymers have a heat of<br>
fusion of less than 85 J/g and/or a pellet blocking strength of equal to or less than 100 pounds/foot2 (4800 Pa), preferably equal to or less than 50 lbs/ft2 (2400 Pa), especially equal to or less than 5 lbs/ft2 (240 Pa), and as low as 0 lbs/ft2 (0 Pa).<br>
[50]	In other embodiments, the ethylene/a-olefin interpolymers comprise, in<br>
polymerized form, at least 50 mole percent ethylene and have a 70°C compression set of less than 80 percent, preferably less than 70 percent or less than 60 percent, most preferably less than 40 to 50 percent and down to close zero percent.<br>
[51]	In some embodiments, the multi-block copolymers possess a PDI fitting a<br>
Schultz-Flory distribution rather than a Poisson distribution. The copolymers are fiuther characterized as having both a polydisperse block distribution and a polydisperse distribution of block sizes and possessing a most probable distribution of block lengths. Preferred multi-block copolymers are those containing 4 or more blocks or segments including terminal blocks. More preferably, the copolymers include at least 5, 10 or 20 blocks or segments including terminal blocks.<br>
[52]	Comonomer content may be measured using any suitable technique, with<br>
techniques based on nuclear magnetic resonance ("NMR") spectroscopy preferred. Moreover, for polymers or blends of polymers having relatively broad TREF curves, the polymer desirably is first fractionated using TREF into fractions each having an eluted<br><br>
temperature range of 10°C or less. That is, each eluted fraction has a collection temperature window of 10°C or less. Using this technique, said block interpolymers have at least one such fraction having a higher molar comonomer content than a corresponding fraction of the comparable interpolymer.<br>
[1] In another aspect, the inventive polymer is an olefin interpolymer, preferably comprising ethylene and one or more copolymerizable comonomers in polymerized form, characterized by multiple blocks (i.e., at least two blocks) or segments of two or more polymerized monomer units differing in chemical or physical properties (blocked interpolymer), most preferably a multi-block copolymer, said block interpolymer having a peak (but not just a molecular fraction) which elutes between 40°C and 130°C (but without collecting and/or isolating individual fractions), characterized in that said peak, has a comonomer content estimated by infra-red spectroscopy when expanded using a frill width/half maximum (FWHM) area calculation, has an average molar comonomer content higher, preferably at least 5 percent higher, more preferably at least 10 percent higher, than that of a comparable random ethylene interpolymer peak at the same elution temperature and expanded using a full width/half maximum (FWHM) area calculation, wherein said comparable random ethylene interpolymer has the same comonomer(s) and has a melt index, density, and molar comonomer content (based on the whole polymer) within 10 percent of that of the blocked interpolymer. Preferably, the Mw/Mn of the comparable interpolymer is also within 10 percent of that of the blocked interpolymer and/or the comparable interpolymer has a total comonomer content within 10 weight percent of that of the blocked interpolymer. The full width/half maximum (FWHM) calculation is based on the ratio of methyl to methylene response area [CH3/CH2] from the ATREF infra-red detector, wherein the tallest (highest) peak is identified from the base line, and then the FWHM area is determined. For a distribution measured using an ATREF peak, the FWHM area is defined as the area under the curve between Ti and T2, where Tj and T2 are points determined, to the left and right of the ATREF peak, by dividing the peak height by two, and then drawing a line horizontal to the base line, that intersects the left and right portions of the ATREF curve.   A calibration curve for comonomer content is made using random ethylene/a-olefin copolymers, plotting comonomer content from NMR versus FWHM area ratio of the TREF peak. For this infra-red method, the calibration curve is generated for the same comonomer type of interest. The comonomer content of TREF peak of the inventive polymer can be<br><br>
determined by referencing this calibration curve using its FWHM methyl; methylene area ratio [CH3/CH2] of the TREF peak.<br>
[54]	Comonomer content may be measured using any suitable technique, with<br>
techniques based on nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy preferred. Using this technique, said blocked interpolymers has higher molar comonomer content than a corresponding comparable interpolymer.<br>
[55]	Preferably, for interpolymers of ethylene and 1-octene, the block interpolymer<br>
has a comonomer content of the TREF fraction eluting between 40 and 130°C greater than or equal to the quantity (- 0.2013) T + 20.07, more preferably greater than or equal to the quantity (-0.2013) T+ 21.07, where T is the numerical value of the peak elution temperature of the TREF fraction being compared, measured in °C.<br>
[56]	Figure 4 graphically depicts an embodiment of the block interpolymers of<br>
ethylene and 1-octene where a plot of the comonomer content versus TREF elution temperature for several comparable ethylene/1-octene interpolymers (random copolymers) are fit to a line representing (- 0.2013) T + 20.07 (solid line). The line for the equation (-0.2013) T + 21.07 is depicted by a dotted line. Also depicted are the comonomer contents for fractions of several block ethylene/1-octene interpolymers of the invention (multi-block copolymers). All of the block interpolymer fractions have significantly higher 1-octene content than either line at equivalent elution temperatures. This result is characteristic of the inventive interpolymer and is believed to be due to the presence of differentiated blocks within the polymer chains, having both crystalline and amorphous nature.<br>
[57]	Figure 5 graphically displays the TREF curve and comonomer contents of<br>
polymer fractions for Example 5 and comparative F to be discussed below. The peak eluting from 40 to 130°C, preferably from 60°C to 95°C for both polymers is fractionated into three parts, each part eluting over a temperature range of less than 10°C. Actual data for Example 5 is represented by triangles. The skilled artisan can appreciate that an appropriate calibration curve may be constructed for interpolymers containing different comonomers and a line used as a comparison fitted to the TREF values obtained from comparative interpolymers of the same monomers, preferably random copolymers made using a metallocene or other homogeneous catalyst composition. Inventive interpolymers are characterized by a molar comonomer content greater than the value determined from the calibration curve at the same TREF elution temperature, preferably at least 5 percent greater, more preferably at least 10 percent greater.<br><br>
[58]	In addition to the above aspects and properties described herein, the inventive<br>
polymers can be characterized by one or more additional characteristics. In one aspect, the inventive polymer is an olefin interpolymer, preferably comprising ethylene and one or more copolymerizable comonomers in polymerized form, characterized by multiple blocks or segments of two or more polymerized monomer units differing in chemical or physical properties (blocked interpolymer), most preferably a multi-block copolymer, said block interpolymer having a molecular fraction which ehites between 40°C and 130°C, when fractionated using TREF increments, characterized in that said fraction has a molar comonomer content higher, preferably at least 5 percent higher, more preferably at least 10, 15, 20 or 25 percent higher, than that of a comparable random ethylene interpolymer fraction eluting between the same temperatures, wherein said comparable random ethylene interpolymer comprises the same comonomer(s), preferably it is the same comonomer(s), and a melt index, density, and molar comonomer content (based on the whole polymer) within 10 percent of that of the blocked interpolymer. Preferably, the Mw/Mn of the comparable interpolymer is also within 10 percent of that of the blocked interpolymer and/or the comparable interpolymer has a total comonomer content within 10 weight percent of that of the blocked interpolymer.<br>
[1] Preferably, the above interpolymers are interpolymers of ethylene and at least one ct-<br>
olefin, especially those interpolymers having a whole polymer density from about 0.855 to<br>
•j about 0.935 g/cm , and more especially for polymers having more than about 1 mole percent<br>
comonomer, the blocked interpolymer has a comonomer content of the TREF fraction eluting<br>
between 40 and 130°C greater than or equal to the quantity (- 0.1356)T + 13.89, more<br>
preferably greater than or equal to the quantity (-0.1356) T+ 14.93, and most preferably<br>
greater than or equal to the quantity (-0.2013)T + 21.07, where T is the numerical value of the<br>
peak ATREF elution temperature of the TREF fraction being compared, measured in °C.<br>
[60]	Preferably, for the above interpolymers of ethylene and at least one alpha-<br>
olefin especially those interpolymers having a whole polymer density from about 0.855 to<br>
about 0.935 g/cm3, and more especially for polymers having more than about I mole percent<br>
comonomer, the blocked interpolymer has a comonomer content of the TREF fraction eluting<br>
between 40 and 130°C greater than or equal to the quantity (- 0.2013) T + 20.07, more<br>
preferably greater than or equal to the quantity (-0.2013) T+ 21.07, where T is the numerical<br>
value of the peak elution temperature of the TREF fraction being compared, measured in °C.<br><br>
[61]	In still another aspect, the inventive polymer is an olefin interpolymer,<br>
preferably comprising ethylene and one or more copolymerizable comonomers in polymerized form, characterized by multiple blocks or segments of two or more polymerized monomer units differing in chemical or physical properties (blocked interpolymer), most preferably a multi-block copolymer, said block interpolymer having a molecular fraction which elutes between 40°C and 130°C, when fractionated using TREF increments, characterized in that every fraction having a comonomer content of at least about 6 mole percent, has a melting point greater than about 100°C. For those fractions having a comonomer content from about 3 mole percent to about 6 mole percent, every fraction has a DSC melting point of about 110°C or higher. More preferably, said polymer fractions, having at least 1 mol percent comonomer, has a DSC melting point that corresponds to the equation:<br>
Tm &gt; (-5.5926)(mol percent comonomer in the fraction) + 135.90.<br>
[62]	In yet another aspect, the inventive polymer is an olefin interpolymer,<br>
preferably comprising ethylene and one or more copolymerizable comonomers in polymerized form, characterized by multiple blocks or segments of two or more polymerized monomer units differing in chemical or physical properties (blocked interpolymer), most preferably a multi-block copolymer, said block interpolymer having a molecular fraction which elutes between 40°C and I30°C, when fractionated using TREF increments, characterized in that every fraction that has an ATREF elution temperature greater than or equal to about 76°C, has a melt enthalpy (heat of fusion) as measured by DSC, corresponding to the equation:<br>
Heat of fusion (J/gm) 
[63]	The inventive block interpolymers have a molecular fraction which elutes<br>

ATREF Peak Comonomer Composition Measurement by Infra-Red Detector<br>
[64]	The comonomer composition of the TREF peak can be measured using an IR4<br>
infra-red detector available from Polymer Char, Valencia, Spain fhttp://www.polvmerchar.com/).<br>
[65]	The "composition mode" of the detector is equipped with a measurement<br>
sensor (CH2) and composition sensor (CH3) that are fixed narrow band infra-red filters in the region of 2800-3000 cm'1. The measurement sensor detects the methylene (CH2) carbons on the polymer (which directly relates to the polymer concentration in solution) while the composition sensor detects the methyl (CH3) groups of the polymer. The mathematical ratio of the composition signal (CH3) divided by the measurement signal (CH2) is sensitive to the comonomer content of the measured polymer in solution and its response is calibrated with known ethylene alpha-olefin copolymer standards.<br>
[66]	The detector when used with an ATREF instrument provides both a<br>
concentration (CH2) and composition (CH3) signal response of the eluted polymer during the TREF process. A polymer specific calibration can be created by measuring the area ratio of the CH3 to CH2 for polymers with known comonomer content (preferably measured by NMR). The comonomer content of an ATREF peak of a polymer can be estimated by applying a the reference calibration of the ratio of the areas for the individual CH3 and CH2 response (i.e. area ratio CH3/CH2 versus comonomer content).<br>
[67]	The area of the peaks can be calculated using a full width/half maximum<br>
(FWHM) calculation after applying the appropriate baselines to integrate the individual signal responses from the TREF chromatogram. The full width/half maximum calculation is based on the ratio of methyl to methylene response area [CH3/CH2] from the ATREF infrared detector, wherein the tallest (highest) peak is identified from the base line, and then the FWHM area is determined. For a distribution measured using an ATREF peak, the FWHM area is defined as the area under the curve between Tl and T2, where Tl and T2 are points determined, to the left and right of the ATREF peak, by dividing the peak height by two, and then drawing a line horizontal to the base line, that intersects the left and right portions of the ATREF curve.<br>
[68]	The application of infra-red spectroscopy to measure the comonomer content<br>
of polymers in this ATREF-infra-red method is, in principle, similar to that of GPC/FTIR systems as described in the following references: Markovich, Ronald P.; Hazlitt, Lonnie G.; Smith, Linley; "Development of gel-permeation chromatography-Fourier transform infrared<br><br>
spectroscopy for characterization of ethylene-based polyolefin copolymers". Polymeric Materials Science and Engineering (1991), 65,98-100.; and Deslauriers, P.J.; Rohlfing, D.C.; Shieh, E.T.; "Quantifying short chain branching microstructures in ethylene-1-olefin copolymers using size exclusion chromatography and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (SEC-FTIR)", Polymer (2002), 43, 59-170., both of which are incorporated by reference herein in their entirety.<br>
[69]	In other embodiments, the inventive ethylene/a-olefin interpolymer is<br>
characterized by an average block index, ABI, which is greater than zero and up to about 1.0 and a molecular weight distribution, Mw/Mn, greater than about 1.3. The average block index, ABI, is the weight average of the block index ("BI") for each of the polymer fractions obtained in preparative TREF from 20°C and 110°C, with an increment of 5°C :<br>
^/ = 2(w,5/,)<br>
where BI; is the block index for the ith fraction of the inventive ethylene/a-olefin interpolymer obtained in preparative TREF, and Wj is the weight percentage of the ith fraction.<br>
[70]	For each polymer fraction, BI is defined by one of the two following equations<br>
(both of which give the same BI value):<br>
BIJITx-UTxooxBI_    LnPx-LnPX0<br>
1/7,-1/7,,	LnPA-LnPAB<br>
where Tx is the preparative ATREF elution temperature for the ith fraction (preferably expressed in Kelvin), Px is the ethylene mole fraction for the ith fraction, which can be measured by NMR or IR as described above. PAB is the ethylene mole fraction of the whole ethylene/a-olefin interpolymer (before fractionation), which also can be measured by NMR or IR. TA and PA are the ATREF elution temperature and the ethylene mole fraction for pure "hard segments" (which refer to the crystalline segments of the interpolymer). As a first order approximation, the TA and PA values are set to those for high density polyethylene homopolymer, if the actual values for the "hard segments" are not available. For calculations performed herein, TA is 372°K, PA is 1.<br>
[71]	TAB is the ATREF temperature for a random copolymer of the same<br>
composition and having an ethylene mole fraction of PAB- TAB can be calculated from the following equation:<br>
Ln PAB - O/TAB + (5<br><br>
where a and p are two constants which can be determined by calibration using a number of known random ethylene copolymers. It should be noted that a and p may vary from instrument to instrument. Moreover, one would need to create their own calibration curve with the polymer composition of interest and also in a similar molecular weight range as the fractions. There is a slight molecular weight effect. If the calibration curve is obtained from similar molecular weight ranges, such effect would be essentially negligible. In some embodiments, random ethylene copolymers satisfy the following relationship:<br>
Ln P = -237.83/TATREF + 0.639 Txo is the ATREF temperature for a random copolymer of the same composition and having an ethylene mole fraction of Px* Txo can be calculated from LnPx - a/Txo + P-Conversely, Pxo is the ethylene mole fraction for a random copolymer of the same composition and having an ATREF temperature of Tx, which can be calculated from Ln Pxo = o/Tx + P-<br>
172]	Once the block index (BI) for each preparative TREF fraction is obtained, the<br>
weight average block index, ABI, for the whole polymer can be calculated In some embodiments, ABI is greater than zero but less than about 0.3 or from about 0.1 to about 0.3. In other embodiments, ABI is greater than about 0.3 and up to about 1.0. Preferably, ABI should be in the range of from about 0.4 to about 0.7, from about 0.5 to about 0.7, or from about 0.6 to about 0.9. In some embodiments, ABI is in the range of from about 0.3 to about 0.9, from about 0.3 to about 0.8, or from about 0.3 to about 0.7, from about 0.3 to about 0.6, from about 0.3 to about 0.5, or from about 0.3 to about 0.4. In other embodiments, ABI is in the range of from about 0.4 to about 1.0, from about 0.5 to about 1.0, or from about 0.6 to about 1.0, from about 0.7 to about 1.0, from about 0.8 to about 1.0, or from about 0.9 to about 1.0.<br>
[1] Another characteristic of the inventive ethylene/a-olefin interpolymer is that the inventive ethylene/a-olefin interpolymer comprises at least one polymer fraction which can be obtained by preparative TREF, wherein the fraction has a block index greater than about 0.1 and up to about 1.0 and a molecular weight distribution, Mw/Mn, greater than about 1.3. In some embodiments, the polymer fraction has a block index greater than about 0.6 and up to about 1.0, greater than about 0.7 and up to about 1.0, greater than about 0.8 and up to about 1.0, or greater than about 0.9 and up to about 1.0. In other embodiments, the polymer fraction has a block index greater than about 0.1 and up to about 1.0, greater than about 0.2 and up to about 1.0, greater than about 0.3 and up to about 1.0, greater than about 0.4 and up<br><br>
to about 1.0, or greater than about 0.4 and up to about 1.0. In still other embodiments, the polymer fraction has a block index greater than about 0.1 and up to about 0.5, greater than about 0.2 and up to about 0.5, greater than about 0.3 and up to about 0.5, or greater than about 0.4 and up to about 0.5. In yet other embodiments, the polymer fraction has a block index greater than about 02 and up to about 0.9, greater than about 0.3 and up to about 0.8, greater than about 0.4 and up to about 0.7, or greater than about 0.5 and up to about 0.6.<br>
[74]	For copolymers of ethylene and an a-olefin, the inventive polymers preferably<br>
possess (1) a PDI of at least 1.3, more preferably at least 1.5, at least 1.7, or at least 2.0, and most preferably at least 2.6, up to a maximum value of 5.0, more preferably up to a maximum of 3.5, and especially up to a maximum of 2.7; (2) a heat of fusion of 80 J/g or less; (3) an ethylene content of at least 50 weight percent; (4) a glass transition temperature, Tg, of less than -25°C, more preferably less than -30°C, and/or (5) one and only one Tm.<br>
[1] Further, the inventive polymers can have, alone or in combination with any other properties disclosed herein* a storage modulus, G', such that log (G') is greater than or equal to 400 kPa, preferably greater than or equal to 1.0 MPa, at a temperature of 100°C. Moreover, the inventive polymers possess a relatively flat storage modulus as a function of temperature in the range from 0 to 100°C (illustrated in Figure 6) that is characteristic of block copolymers, and heretofore unknown for an olefin copolymer, especially a copolymer of ethylene and one or more C3.8 aliphatic ct-olefins. (By the term "relatively flat" in this context is meant that log G' (in Pascals) decreases by less than one order of magnitude between 50 and 100°C, preferably between 0 and 100°C).<br>
[76]	The inventive interpolymers may be further characterized by a<br>
thermomechanical analysis penetration depth of 1 mm at a temperature of at least 90°C as well as a flexural modulus of from 3 kpsi (20 MPa) to 13 kpsi (90 MPa). Alternatively, the inventive interpolymers can have a thermomechanical analysis penetration depth of 1 mm at a temperature of at least 104°C as well as a flexural modulus of at least 3 kpsi (20 MPa). They may be characterized as having an abrasion resistance (or volume loss) of less than 90 mm3. Figure 7 shows the TMA (1 mm) versus flex modulus for the inventive polymers, as compared to other known polymers. The inventive polymers have significantly better flexibility-heat resistance balance than the other polymers.<br>
[77]	Additionally, the ethylene/ a-olefin interpolymers can have a melt index, I2,<br>
from 0.01 to 2000 g/10 minutes, preferably from 0.01 to 1000 g/10 minutes, more preferably from 0.01 to 500 g/10 minutes, and especially from 0.01 to 100 g/10 minutes. In certain<br><br>
embodiments, the ethylene/a-olefin interpolymers have a melt index, h, from 0.01 to 10 g/10 minutes, from 0.5 to 50 g/10 minutes, from 1 to 30 g/10 minutes, from 1 to 6 g/10 minutes or from 0.3 to 10 g/10 minutes. In certain embodiments, the melt index for the ethylene/a-olefin polymers is lg/10 minutes, 3 g/10 minutes or 5 g/10 minutes.<br>
[11 The polymers can have molecular weights, Mw, from 1,000 g/mole to 5,000,000 g/mole, preferably from 1000 g/mole to 1,000,000, more preferably from 10,000 g/mole to 500,000 g/mole, and especially from 10,000 g/mole to 300,000 g/mole. The density of the inventive polymers can be from 0.80 to 0.99 g/cm3 and preferably for ethylene containing polymers from 0.85 g/cm to 0.97 g/cm . In certain embodiments, the density of the ethylene/a-olefin polymers ranges from 0.860 to 0.925 g/cm3 or 0.867 to 0.910 g/cm3.<br>
[79]	The process of making the polymers has been disclosed in the following patent<br>
applications: U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/553,906, filed March 17,2004; U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/662,937, filed March 17,2005; U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/662,939, filed March 17, 2005; U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/5662938, filed March 17, 2005; PCT Application No. PCT/US2005/008916, filed March 17,2005;PCT Application No. PCT/US2005/008915, filed March 17,2005; and PCT Application No. PCT/US2005/008917, filed March 17,2005, all of which are incorporated by reference herein in their entirety. For example, one such method comprises contacting ethylene and optionally one or more addition polymerizable monomers other than ethylene under addition polymerization conditions with a catalyst composition comprising: the admixture or reaction product resulting from combining:<br>
(A)	a first olefin polymerization catalyst having a high comonomer incorporation index,<br>
(B)	a second olefin polymerization catalyst having a comonomer incorporation index less than 90 percent, preferably less than 50 percent, most preferably less than 5 percent of the comonomer incorporation index of catalyst (A), and<br>
(C)	a chain shuttling agent.<br>
[80]	Representative catalysts and chain shuttling agent are as follows.<br>
Catalyst (Al) is [N-(2,6-di(l-methylethyl)phenyl)amido)(2-isopropyIphenyI)(a-naphthalen-2-diyl(6-pyridin-2-diyl)methane)]hafnium dimethyl, prepared according to the teachings of WO 03/40195, 2003US0204017, USSN 10/429,024, filed May 2, 2003, and WO<br>
04/24740.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
[90]	Shuttling Agents The shuttling agents employed include diethylzinc, di(i-<br>
butyl)zinc, di(n-hexyl)zinc, triethylaluminum, trioctylaluminum, triethylgallium, i-butylaluminum bis(dimethyl(t-butyl)siloxane), i-butylaluminum bis(di(trimethylsilyl)amide), n-octylaluminum di(pyridine-2-methoxide), bis(n-octadecyl)i-butylaluminum, i-butylaluminum bis(di(n-pentyl)amide), n-octylaluminum bis(2,6-di-t-butylphenoxide, n-octylaluminum di(ethyl(l-naphthyl)amide), ethylaluminum bis(t-butyldimethylsiloxide), ethylaluminum di(bis(trimethylsilyl)amide), ethylaluminum bis(2,3,6,7-dibenzo-l-azacycloheptaneamide), n-octylaluminum bis(2,3,6,7-dibenzo-l-azacycloheptaneamide), n-octylaluminum bis(dimethyl(t-butyl)siloxide, ethylzinc (256-diphenylphenoxide), and ethylzinc (t-butoxide).<br>
[1] Preferably, the foregoing process takes the form of a continuous solution process for forming block copolymers, especially multi-block copolymers, preferably linear multi-block copolymers of two or more monomers, more especially ethylene and a C3-20 olefin or cycloolefin, and most especially ethylene and a C4-20 a-olefin, using multiple catalysts that are incapable of interconversion. That is, the catalysts are chemically distinct. Under continuous solution polymerization conditions, the process is ideally suited for polymerization of mixtures of monomers at high monomer conversions. Under these polymerization conditions, shuttling from the chain shuttling agent to the catalyst becomes advantaged compared to chain growth, and multi-block copolymers, especially linear multi-block copolymers are formed in high efficiency.<br>
[92]	The inventive interpolymers may be differentiated from conventional, random<br>
copolymers, physical blends of polymers, and block copolymers prepared via sequential monomer addition, fluxional catalysts, anionic or cationic living polymerization techniques. In particular, compared to a random copolymer of the same monomers and monomer content at equivalent crystallinity or modulus, the inventive interpolymers have better (higher) heat<br><br>
resistance as measured by melting point, higher TMA penetration temperature, higher high-temperature tensile strength, and/or higher high-temperature torsion storage modulus as determined by dynamic mechanical analysis. Compared to a random copolymer containing the same monomers and monomer content, the inventive interpolymers have lower compression set, particularly at elevated temperatures, lower stress relaxation, higher creep resistance, higher tear strength, higher blocking resistance, faster setup due to higher crystallization (solidification) temperature, higher recovery (particularly at elevated temperatures), better abrasion resistance, higher retractive force, and better oil and filler acceptance.<br>
[93J	The inventive interpolymers also exhibit a unique crystallization and<br>
branching distribution relationship. That is, the inventive interpolymers have a relatively large difference between the tallest peak temperature measured using CRYSTAF and DSC as a function of heat of fusion, especially as compared to random copolymers containing the same monomers and monomer level or physical blends of polymers, such as a blend of a high density polymer and a lower density copolymer, at equivalent overall density. It is believed that this unique feature of the inventive interpolymers is due to the unique distribution of the comonomer in blocks within the polymer backbone. In particular, the inventive interpolymers may comprise alternating blocks of differing comonomer content (including homopolymer blocks). The inventive interpolymers may also comprise a distribution in number and/or block size of polymer blocks of differing density or comonomer content, which is a Schultz-Flory type of distribution. In addition, the inventive interpolymers also have a unique peak melting point and crystallization temperature profile that is substantially independent of polymer density, modulus, and morphology. In a preferred embodiment, the microcrystalline order of the polymers demonstrates characteristic spherulites and lamellae that are distinguishable from random or block copolymers, even at PDI values that are less than 1.7, or even less than 1.5, down to less than 1.3.<br>
(1] Moreover, the inventive interpolymers may be prepared using techniques to influence the degree or level of blockiness. That is the amount of comonomer and length of each polymer block or segment can be altered by controlling the ratio and type of catalysts and shuttling agent as well as the temperature of the polymerization, and other polymerization variables. A surprising benefit of this phenomenon is the discovery that as the degree of blockiness is increased, the optical properties, tear strength, and high temperature recovery properties of the resulting polymer are improved. In particular, haze decreases while clarity,<br><br>
tear strength, and high temperature recovery properties increase as the average number of blocks in the polymer increases. By selecting shuttling agents and catalyst combinations having the desired chain transferring ability (high rates of shuttling with low levels of chain termination) other forms of polymer termination are effectively suppressed. Accordingly, little if any J}-hydride elimination is observed in the polymerization of ethylene/ a-olefin comonomer mixtures according to embodiments of the invention, and the resulting crystalline blocks are highly, or substantially completely, linear, possessing little or no long chain branching.<br>
[95]	Polymers with highly crystalline chain ends can be selectively prepared in<br>
accordance with embodiments of the invention. In elastomer applications, reducing the relative quantity of polymer that terminates with an amorphous block reduces the intermolecular dilutive effect on crystalline regions. This result can be obtained by choosing chain shuttling agents and catalysts having an appropriate response to hydrogen or other chain terminating agents. Specifically, if the catalyst which produces highly crystalline polymer is more susceptible to chain termination (such as by use of hydrogen) than the catalyst responsible for producing the less crystalline polymer segment (such as through higher comonomer incorporation, regio-error, or atactic polymer formation), then the highly crystalline polymer segments will preferentially populate the terminal portions of the polymer. Not only are the resulting terminated groups crystalline, but upon termination, the highly crystalline polymer forming catalyst site is once again available for reinitiation of polymer formation. The initially formed polymer is therefore another highly crystalline polymer segment. Accordingly, both ends of the resulting multi-block copolymer are preferentially highly crystalline.<br>
[1] The ethylene a-olefin interpolymers used in the embodiments of the invention are preferably interpolymers of ethylene with at least one C3-C20 a-olefin. Copolymers of ethylene and a C3-C20 a-olefin are especially preferred. The interpolymers may further comprise C4-C18 diolefin and/or alkenylbenzene. Suitable unsaturated comonomers useful<br>
for polymerizing with ethylene include, for example, ethylenically unsaturated monomers, conjugated or nonconjugated dienes, polyenes, alkenylbenzenes, etc. Examples of such comonomers include C3-C20 
1-pentene, 4-methyl-l-pentene, 1-heptene, 1-octene, 1-nonene, 1-decene, and the like. I-Butene and 1-octene are especially preferred. Other suitable monomers include styrene, halo-<br><br>
or alkyl-substituted styrenes, vinylbenzocyclobutane, 1,4-hexadiene, 1,7-octadiene, and naphthenics (e.g., cyclopentene, cyclohexene and cyclooctene).<br>
[97]	While ethylene/tx-olefin interpolymers are preferred polymers, other<br>
ethylene/olefin polymers may also be used. Olefins as used herein refer to a family of unsaturated hydrocarbon-based compounds with at least one carbon-carbon double bond. Depending on the selection of catalysts, any olefin may be used in embodiments of the invention. Preferably, suitable olefins are C3-C2O aliphatic and aromatic compounds<br>
containing vinyiic unsaturation, as well as cyclic compounds, such as cyclobutene, cyclopentene, dicyclopentadiene, and norbornene, including but not limited to, norbornene substituted in the 5 and 6 position with C1-C20 hydrocarbyl or cyclohydrocarbyl groups. Also included are mixtures of such olefins as well as mixtures of such olefins with C4-C40<br>
diolefin compounds.<br>
[98]	Examples of olefin monomers include, but are not limited to propylene,<br>

In certain embodiments, the a-olefin is propylene, 1-butene, 1-pentene, 1-hexene, 1-octene or a combination thereof. Although any hydrocarbon containing a vinyl group potentially may be used in embodiments of the invention, practical issues such as monomer availability, cost, and the ability to conveniently remove unreacted monomer from the resulting polymer may become more problematic as the molecular weight of the monomer becomes too high.<br>
[99]	The polymerization processes described herein are well suited for the<br>
production of olefin polymers comprising monovinylidene aromatic monomers including styrene, o-methyl styrene, p-methyl styrene, t-butylstyrene, and the like. In particular, interpolymers comprising ethylene and styrene can be prepared by following the teachings herein. Optionally, copolymers comprising ethylene, styrene and a C3-C2O alpha olefin, optionally comprising a C4-C20 diene, having improved properties can be prepared.<br><br>
[100]	Suitable non-conjugated diene monomers can be a straight chain, branched<br>
chain or cyclic hydrocarbon diene having from 6 to 15 carbon atoms. Examples of suitable non-conjugated dienes include, but are not limited to, straight chain acyclic dienes, such as 1,4-hexadiene, 1,6-octadiene, 1,7-octadiene, 1,9-decadiene, branched chain acyclic dienes, such as 5-methyl-1,4-hexadiene; 3,7-dimethyl- 1,6-octadiene; 3,7-dimethyl-l,7-octadiene and mixed isomers of dihydromyricene and dihydroocinene, single ring alicyclic dienes, such as 1,3-cycIopentadiene; 1,4-cyclohexadiene; 1,5-cyclooctadieneand 1,5-cyclododecadiene, and multi-ring alicyclic fused and bridged ring dienes, such as tetrahydroindene, methyl tetrahydroindene, dicyclopentadiene, bicyclo-(2,2,l)-hepta-2,5-diene; alkenyl, alkylidene, cycloalkenyl and cycloalkylidene norbornenes, such as 5-methylene-2-norbornene (MNB); 5-propenyl-2-norbornene, 5-isopropylidene-2-norbornene, 5-(4-cyclopentenyl)-2-norbornene, 5-cyclohexylidene-2-norbornene, 5-vinyl-2-norbomene, and norbornadiene. Of the dienes typically used to prepare EPDMs, the particularly preferred dienes are 1,4-hexadiene (HD), 5-ethylidene-2-norbornene (ENB), 5-vinylidene-2-norbornene (VNB), 5-methylene-2-norbornene (MNB), and dicyclopentadiene (DCPD). The especially preferred dienes are 5-ethylidene-2-norbomene (ENB) and 1,4-hexadiene (HD).<br>
[101]	One class of desirable polymers that can be made in accordance with<br>
embodiments of the invention are elastomeric interpolymers of ethylene, a C3-C20 a-olefin, especially propylene, and optionally one or more diene monomers. Preferred a-olefins for use in this embodiment of the present invention are designated by the formula CH2=CHR*, where R* is a linear or branched alkyl group of from 1 to 12 carbon atoms. Examples of suitable a-olefins include, but are not limited to, propylene, isobutylene, 1-butene, 1-pentene, 1-hexene, 4-methyl-1-pentene, and 1-octene. A particularly preferred a-olefin is propylene. The propylene based polymers are generally referred to in the art as EP or EPDM polymers. Suitable dienes for use in preparing such polymers, especially multi-block EPDM type polymers include conjugated or non-conjugated, straight or branched chain-, cyclic- or polycyclic- dienes comprising from 4 to 20 carbons. Preferred dienes include 1,4-pentadiene, 1,4-hexadiene, 5-ethylidene-2-norbornene, dicyclopentadiene, cyclohexadiene, and 5-butylidene-2-norbomene. A particularly preferred diene is 5-ethylidene-2-norbornene.<br>
[102]        Because the diene containing polymers comprise alternating segments or blocks containing greater or lesser quantities of the diene (including none) and a-olefin (including none), the total quantity of diene and a-olefin may be reduced without loss of subsequent polymer properties. That is, because the diene and a-olefin monomers are<br><br>
preferentially incorporated into one type of block of the polymer rather than uniformly or randomly throughout the polymer, they are more efficiently utilized and subsequently the crosslink density of the polymer can be better controlled. Such crosshnkable elastomers and the cured products have advantaged properties, including higher tensile strength and better elastic recovery.<br>
[1] In some embodiments, the inventive interpolymers made with two catalysts incorporating differing quantities of comonomer have a weight ratio of blocks formed thereby from 95:5 to 5:95. The elastomeric polymers desirably have an ethylene content of from 20 to 90 percent, a diene content of from 0.1 to 10 percent, and an a-olefin content of from 10 to 80 percent, based on the total weight of the polymer. Further preferably, the multi-block elastomeric polymers have an ethylene content of from 60 to 90 percent, a diene content of from 0.1 to 10 percent, and an a-olefin content of from 10 to 40 percent, based on the total weight of the polymer. Preferred polymers are high molecular weight polymers, having a weight average molecular weight (Mw) from 10,000 to about 2,500,000, preferably from 20,000 to 500,000, more preferably from 20,000 to 350,000, and a polydispersity less than 3.5, more preferably less than 3.0, and a Mooney viscosity (ML (1+4) 125°C.) from 1 to 250. More preferably, such polymers have an ethylene content from 65 to 75 percent, a diene content from 0 to 6 percent, and an a-olefin content from 20 to 35 percent.<br>
[104]	The ethylene/a-olefin interpolymers can be functionalized by incorporating at<br>
least one functional group in its polymer structure. Exemplary functional groups may include, for example, ethylenically unsaturated mono- and di-functional carboxylic acids, ethylenically unsaturated mono- and di-fimctional carboxylic acid anhydrides, salts thereof and esters thereof. Such functional groups may be grafted to an ethylene/ a -olefin interpolymer, or it may be copolymerized with ethylene and an optional additional comonomer to form an interpolymer of ethylene, the functional comonomer and optionally other comonomer(s). Means for grafting functional groups onto polyethylene are described for example in U.S. Patents Nos. 4,762,890,4,927,888, and 4,950,541, the disclosures of these patents are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.

[120]        wherein each A is a polymer block comprising a Yinyl aromatic monomer, preferably styrene, and each B is a polymer block comprising a conjugated diene, preferably isoprene or butadiene, and optionally a vinyl aromatic monomer, preferably styrene; R is the remnant of a multifunctional coupling agent (if R is present, the block copolymer can be a star or branched block copolymer); n is an integer from 1 to 5; x is zero or 1; and y is a real number from zero to 4.<br>
[121]	Methods for the preparation of such block copolymers are known in the<br>
art. See, e.g., U.S. Patent No. 5,418,290. Suitable catalysts for the preparation of useful block copolymers with unsaturated rubber monomer units include lithium based catalysts and especially lithium-alkyls. U.S. Patent No. 3,595,942 describes suitable methods for hydrogenation of block copolymers with unsaturated rubber monomer units to from block copolymers with saturated rubber monomer units. The structure of the polymers is determined by their methods of polymerization. For example, linear polymers result by sequential introduction of the desired rubber monomer into the reaction vessel when using such initiators as lithium-alkyls or dilithiostilbene and the like, or by coupling a two segment block copolymer with a difunctionai coupling agent. Branched structures, on the other hand, may be obtained by the use of suitable coupling agents having a fimctionality with respect to the block copolymers with unsaturated rubber monomer units of three or more. Coupling may be effected with multifunctional coupling agents such as dihaloalkanes or aikenes and divinyl benzene as well as with<br><br>
certain polar compounds such as silicon halides, siloxanes or esters of monohydric alcohols with carboxylic acids. The presence of any coupling residues in the polymer may be ignored for an adequate description of the block copolymers.<br>
[1]	Suitable block copolymers having unsaturated rubber monomer units<br>
include, but are not limited to, styrene-butadiene (SB), styrene-ethylene/butadiene (SEB), styrene-isoprene(SI), styrene-butadiene-styrene (SBS), styrene-isoprene-styrene (SIS), a-methylstyrene-butadiene- a-methylstyrene and a-methylstyrene-isoprene-a-methylstyrene.<br>
[123]        The styrenic portion of the block copolymer is preferably a polymer or interpolymer of styrene and its analogs and homologs including a-methylstyrene and ring-substituted styrenes, particularly ring-methylated styrenes. The preferred styrenics are styrene and a -methylstyrene, and styrene is particularly preferred<br>
[124]	Block copolymers with unsaturated rubber monomer units may comprise<br>
homopolymers of butadiene or isoprene or they may comprise copolymers of one or both of these two dienes with a minor amount of styrenic monomer. In some embodiments, the block copolymers are derived from (i) a C3-20 olefin substituted with an alkyl or aryl group (e.g., 4-methyI-l-pentene and styrene) and (ii) a diene (e.g. butadiene, 1,5-hexadiene, 1,7-octadiene and 1,9-decadiene). A non-limiting example of such olefin copolymer includes styrene-butadiene-styrene (SBS) block copolymer.<br>
[125]	Preferred block copolymers with saturated rubber monomer units<br>
comprise at least one segment of a styrenic unit and at least one segment of an ethylene-butene or ethylene-propylene copolymer. Preferred examples of such block copolymers with saturated rubber monomer units include styrene/ethylene-butene copolymers, styrene/ethylene-propylene copolymers, styrene/ethylene-butene/styrene (SEBS) copolymers, styrene/ethylene-propylene/styrene (SEPS) copolymers.<br>
[126]        Hydrogenation of block copolymers with unsaturated rubber monomer units is preferably effected by use of a catalyst comprising the reaction products of an aluminum alkyl compound with nickel or cobalt carboxylates or alkoxides under such conditions as to substantially completely hydrogenate at least 80 percent of the aliphatic double bonds while hydrogenating no more than 25 percent of the styrenic aromatic double bonds. Preferred block copolymers are those where at least 99 percent of the<br><br>
aliphatic double bonds are hydrogenated while less than 5 percent of the aromatic double bonds are hydrogenated.<br>
[127]	The proportion of the styrenic blocks is generally between 8 and 65<br>
percent by weight of the total weight of the block copolymer. Preferably, the block copolymers contain from 10 to 35 weight percent of styrenic block segments and from 90 to 65 weight percent of rubber monomer block segments, based on the total weight of the block copolymer.<br>
[128]        The average molecular weights of the individual blocks may vary within certain limits. In most instances, the styrenic block segments will have number average molecular weights in the range of 5,000 to 125,000, preferably from 7,000 to 60,000 while the rubber monomer block segments will have average molecular weights in the range of 10,000 to 300,000, preferably from 30,000 to 150,000. The total average molecular weight of the block copolymer is typically in the range of 25,000 to 250,000, preferably from 35,000 to 200,000.<br>
[129]        Further, the various block copolymers suitable for use in embodiments of the invention may be modified by graft incorporation of minor amounts of iunctional groups, such as, for example, maleic anhydride by any of the methods well known in the art.<br>

[150]	Irradiation may be accomplished by the use of high energy, ionizing<br>
electrons, ultra violet rays, X-rays, gamma rays, beta particles and the like and combination thereof. Preferably, electrons are employed up to 70 megarads dosages. The irradiation source can be any electron beam generator operating in a range of about 150 kilovolts to about 6 megavolts with a power output capable of supplying the desired dosage. The voltage can be adjusted to appropriate levels which may be, for example, 100,000, 300,000,1,000,000 or 2,000,000 or 3,000,000 or 6,000,000 or higher or lower. Many other apparati for irradiating polymeric materials are known in the art. The irradiation is usually carried out at a dosage between about 3 megarads to about 35 megarads, preferably between about 8 to about 20 megarads. Further, the irradiation can be carried out conveniently at room temperature, although higher and lower temperatures, for example 0° C. to about 60° C, may also be employed. Preferably, the irradiation is carried out after shaping or fabrication of the article. Also, in a preferred embodiment, the ethylene interpolymer which has been incorporated with a pro-rad additive is irradiated with electron beam radiation at about 8 to about 20 megarads.<br>
[151]        Crosslinking can be promoted with a crosslinking catalyst, and any catalyst that will provide this function can be used. Suitable catalysts generally include<br><br>
organic bases, carboxylic acids, and organometallic compounds including organic titanates and complexes or carboxylates of lead, cobalt, iron, nickel, zinc and tin. Dibutyltindilaurate, dioctyltinmaleate, dibutyltindiacetate, dibutyltindioctoate, stannous acetate, stannous octoate, lead naphthenate, zinc caprylate, cobalt naphthenate; and the like. Tin carboxylate, especially dibutyltindilaurate and dioctyltinmaleate, are particularly effective for this invention. The catalyst (or mixture of catalysts) is present in a catalytic amount, typically between about 0.015 and about 0.035 phr.<br>
[152]	Representative pro-rad additives include, but are not limited to, azo<br>
compounds, organic peroxides and polyfimctional vinyl or allyl compounds such as, for example,, triallyl cyanurate, triallyl isocyanurate, pentaerthritoi tetramethacrylate, glutaraldehyde, ethylene glycol dimethacrylate, diallvl maleate, dipropargyl maleate, dipropargyl monoallyl cyanurate, dicumyl peroxide, di-tert-butyl peroxide, t-butyl perbenzoate, benzoyl peroxide, cumene hydroperoxide, t-butyl peroctoate, methyl ethyl ketone peroxide, 2,5-dimethyl-2,5-di(t-butyI peroxy)hexane, lauryl peroxide, tert-butyl peracetate, azobisisobutyl nitrite and the like and combination thereof. Preferred pro-rad additives for use in the present invention are compounds which have poly-functional (i.e. at least two) moieties such as C-C, C=N or C=0.<br>
[153]	At least one pro-rad additive can be introduced to the ethylene<br>
interpolymer by any method known in the art. However, preferably the pro-rad additive(s) is introduced via a masterbatch concentrate comprising the same or different base resin as the ethylene interpolymer. Preferably, the pro-rad additive concentration for the masterbatch is relatively high e.g., about 25 weight percent (based on the total weight of the concentrate).<br>
[154]        The at least one pro-rad additive is introduced to the ethylene polymer in any effective amount. Preferably, the at least one pro-rad additive introduction amount is from about 0.001 to about 5 weight percent, more preferably from about 0.005 to about 2.5 weight percent and most preferably from about 0.015 to about 1 weight percent (based on the total weight of the ethylene interpolymer.<br>
[155]	In addition to electron-beam irradiation, crosslinking can also be<br>
effected by UV irradiation. U.S. Patent No. 6,709,742 discloses a cross-linking method by UV irradiation which can be used in embodiments of the invention. The method comprises mixing a photoinitiator, with or without a photocrosslinker, with a polymer<br><br>
before, during, or after a fiber is formed and then exposing the fiber with the photoinitiator to sufficient UV radiation to crosslink the polymer to the desired level. The photo initiators used in the practice of the invention are aromatic ketones, e.g., benzophenones or monoacetals of 1,2-diketones. The primary photoreaction of the monacetals is the homo lytic cleavage of the a-bond to give acyl and dialkoxyalkyl radicals. This type of a-cleavage is known as a Norrish Type I reaction which is more fully described in W. Horspool and D. Armesto, Organic Photochemistry: A Comprehensive Treatment. Ellis Horwood Limited, Chichester, England, 1992; J. Kopecky, Organic Photochemistry: A Visual Approach. VCH Publishers, Inc., New York, NY 1992; N.J. Turro, et al., Ace. Chem.Res,. 1972, 5, 92; and J.T. Banks, et al., J. Am. Chem. Soa, 1993, 115,2473. The synthesis of monoacetals of aromatic 1,2 diketones, Ar-CO-C(OR)2-Art is described in USP 4,190,602 and Ger. Offen. 2,337,813. The preferred compound from this class is 2,2-dimethoxy-2-phenylacetophenone, C6H5-CO-C(OCH3)2-C6H5, which is commercially available from Ciba-Geigy as Irgacure 651. Examples of other aromatic ketones useful in the practice of this invention as photoinitiators are Irgacure 184,369, 819,907 and 2959, all available from Ciba-Geigy.<br>
[156]	In one embodiment of the invention, the photoinitiator is used in<br>
combination with a photocrosslinker. Any photocrosslinker that will upon the generation of free radicals, link two or more polyolefin backbones together through the formation of covalent bonds with the backbones can be used in this invention. Preferably these photocrosslinkers are polyfunctional, i.e., they comprise two or more sites that upon activation will form a covalent bond with a site on the backbone of the copolymer. Representative photocrosslinkers include, but are not limited to polyfunctional vinyl or allyl compounds such as, for example,, triallyl cyanurate, triallyl isocyanurate, pentaerthritol tetramethacrylate, ethylene glycol dimethacrylate, diallyl maleate, dipropargyl maleate, dipropargyl monoallyl cyanurate and the like. Preferred photocrosslinkers for use in the present invention are compounds which have polyfunctional (i.e. at least two) moieties. Particularly preferred photocrosslinkers are triallycyanurate (TAC) and triallyl isocyanurate (TAIC).<br>
[157]        Certain compounds act as both a photoinitiator and a photocrosslinker in the practice of this invention. These compounds are characterized by the ability to<br><br>
generate two or more reactive species (e.g., free radicals, carbenes, nitrenes, etc.) upon exposure to UV-light and to subsequently covalently bond with two polymer chains. Any compound that can perform these two functions can be used in the practice of this invention, and representative compounds include the sulfonyl azides described in U.S. Patent Nos. 6,211,302 and 6,284,842.<br>
[158]	In another embodiment of this invention, the copolymer is subjected to<br>
secondary crosslinking, i.e., crosslinking other than and in addition to photocrosslinking. In this embodiment, the photoinitiator is used either in combination with a nonphotocrosslinker, e.g., a silane, or the copolymer is subjected to a secondary crosslinking procedure, e.g9 exposure to E-beam radiation. Representative examples of silane crosslinkers are described in U.S. Patent No. 5,824,718, and crosslinking through exposure to E-beam radiation is described in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,525,257 and 5,324,576. The use of a photocrosslinker in this embodiment is optional<br>
[159]        At least one photoadditive, ie.9 photoinitiator and optional photocrosslinker, can be introduced to the copolymer by any method known in the art. However, preferably the photoadditive(s) is (are) introduced via a masterbatch concentrate comprising the same or different base resin as the copolymer. Preferably ,the photoadditive concentration for the masterbatch is relatively high e.g., about 25 weight percent (based on the total weight of the concentrate).<br>
[160]        The at least one photoadditive is introduced to the copolymer in any effective amount Preferably, the at least one photoadditive introduction amount is from about 0.001 to about 5, more preferably from about 0.005 to about 2.5 and most preferably from about 0.015 to about 1, wt % (based on the total weight of the copolymer).<br>
[161]	The phototnitiator(s) and optional photocrosslinker(s) can be added<br>
during different stages of the fiber or film manufacturing process. If photoadditives can withstand the extrusion temperature, a polyolefin resin can be mixed with additives before being fed into the extruder, e.g., via a masterbatch addition. Alternatively, additives can be introduced into the extruder just prior the slot die, but in this case the efficient mixing of components before extrusion is important. In another approach, polyolefin fibers can be drawn without photoadditives, and a photoinitiator and/or photocrosslinker can be applied to the extruded fiber via a kiss-roll, spray, dipping into<br><br>
a solution with additives, or by using other industrial methods for post-treatment. The resulting fiber with photoadditive(s) is then cured via electromagnetic radiation in a continuous or batch process. The photo additives can be blended with the polyolefin using conventional compounding equipment, including single and twin-screw extruders.<br>
[162 J	The power of the electromagnetic radiation and the irradiation time are<br>
chosen so as to allow efficient crosslinking without polymer degradation and/or dimensional defects. The preferred process is described in EP 0 490 854 Bl. Photoadditive(s) with sufficient thermal stability is (are) premixed with a polyolefin resin, extruded into a fiber, and irradiated in a continuous process using one energy source or several units linked in a series. There are several advantages to using a continuous process compared with a batch process to cure a fiber or sheet of a knitted fabric which are collected onto a spool.<br>
1163]        Irradiation may be accomplished by the use of UV-radiation. Preferably, UV-radiation is employed up to the intensity of 100 J/cm . The irradiation source can be any UV-light generator operating in a range of about 50 watts to about 25000 watts with a power output capable of supplying the desired dosage. The wattage can be adjusted to appropriate levels which may be, for example, 1000 watts or 4800 watts or 6000 watts or higher or lower. Many other apparati for UV-irradiating polymeric materials are known in the art. The irradiation is usually carried out at a dosage between about 3 J/cm to about 500 J/scm \ preferably between about 5 J/cm to about 100 J/cm2. Further, the irradiation can be carried out conveniently at room temperature, although higher and lower temperatures, for example 0°C to about 60°C, may also be employed. The photocrosslinking process is faster at higher temperatures. Preferably, the irradiation is carried out after shaping or fabrication of the article. In a preferred embodiment, the copolymer which has been incorporated with a photoadditive is irradiated with UV-radiation at about 10 J/cm2 to about 50 J/cm2.<br>
Preparation of the Polymer blends<br>
[164]	The ingredients of the polymer blends, i.e., the ethylene/a-olefin<br>
interpolymer, the polyolefin and the optional additives, can be mixed or blended using methods known to a person of ordinary skill in the art, preferably methods that can provide a substantially homogeneous distribution of the polyolefin and/or the additives<br><br>
in the ethylene/a-olefin interpolymer. Non-limiting examples of suitable blending methods include melt blending, solvent blending, extruding, and the like.<br>
[165]	In some embodiments, the ingredients of the polymer blends are melt<br>
blended by a method as described by Guerin et at. in U.S. Patent No. 4,152,189. First, all solvents, if there are any, are removed from the ingredients by heating to an appropriate elevated temperature of about 100°C to about 200°C or about 150°C to about 175°C at a pressure of about 5 torr (667 Pa) to about 10 torr (1333 Pa). Next, the ingredients are weighed into a vessel in the desired proportions and the polymer blend is formed by heating the contents of the vessel to a molten state while stirring.<br>
[166]        In other embodiments, the ingredients of the polymer blends are processed using solvent blending. First, the ingredients of the desired polymer blend are dissolved in a suitable solvent and the mixture is then mixed or blended. Next, the solvent is removed to provide the polymer blend.<br>
[167]        In further embodiments, physical blending devices that provide dispersive mixing, distributive mixing, or a combination of dispersive and distributive mixing can be useful in preparing homogenous blends. Both batch and continuous methods of physical blending can be used. Non-limiting examples of batch methods include those methods using BRABENDER® mixing equipments (e.g., BRABENDER PREP CENTER®, available from C. W. Brabender Instruments, Inc., South Hackensack, N.J.) or BANBURY® internal mixing and roll milling (available from Farrel Company, Ansonia, Conn.) equipment. Non-limiting examples of continuous methods include single screw extruding, twin screw extruding, disk extruding, reciprocating single screw extruding, and pin barrel single screw extruding. In some embodiments, the additives can be added into an extruder through a feed hopper or feed throat during the extrusion of the ethylene/a-olefin interpolymer, the polyolefin or the polymer blend. The mixing or blending of polymers by extrusion has been described in C. Rauwendaal, "Polymer Extrusion", Hanser Publishers, New York, NY, pages 322-334 (1986), which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
[1]	When one or more additives are required in the polymer blends, the<br>
desired amounts of the additives can be added in one charge or multiple charges to the ethylene/ct-oJefin interpolymer, the polyolefin or the polymer blend. Furthermore, the addition can take place in any order. In some embodiments, the additives are first<br><br>
added and mixed or blended with the ethylene/a-olefin interpolymer and then the additive-containing interpolymer is blended with the polyolefin. In other embodiments, the additives are first added and mixed or blended with the polyolefin and then the additive-containing polyolefin is blended with the ethylene/a-olefin interpolymer. In further embodiments, the ethylene/a-olefin interpolymer is blended with the polyolefin first and then the additives are blended with the polymer blend. Polymer blends can also be performed at the fabrication equipment as dry blends (no pre-compounding required).<br>
[169]        Alternatively, master batches containing high concentrations of the additives can be used. In general, master batches can be prepared by blending either the ethylene/a-olefin interpolymer, the polyolefin or the polymer blend with high concentrations of additives. The master batches can have additive concentrations from about 1 to about 50 wt%, from about 1 to about 40 wt%, from about 1 to about 30 wt%, or from about 1 to about 20 wt% of the total weight of the polymer blend. The master batches can then be added to the polymer blends in an amount determined to provide the desired additive concentrations in the end products. In some embodiments, the master batch contains a slip agent, an anti-blocking agent, a piasticizer, an antioxidant, a UV stabilizer, a colorant or pigment, a filler, a lubricant, an antifogging agent, a flow aid, a coupling agent, a cross-linking agent, a nucleating agent, a surfactant, a solvent, a flame retardant, an antistatic agent, or a combination thereof. In other embodiment, the master batch contains a slip agent, an anti-blocking agent or a combination thereof. In other embodiment, the master batch contains a slip agent.<br>
Applications of the Polymer blends<br>
[170]        The polymer blends disclosed herein can be used to manufacture durable articles for the automotive, construction, medical, food and beverage, electrical, appliance, business machine, and consumer markets. In some embodiments, the polymer blends are used to manufacture flexible durable parts or articles selected from toys, grips, soft touch handles, bumper rub strips, floorings, auto floor mats, wheels, casters, furniture and appliance feet, tags, seals, gaskets such as static and dynamic gaskets, automotive doors, bumper fascia, grill components, rocker panels, hoses, linings, office supplies, seals, liners, diaphragms, tubes, lids, stoppers, plunger tips, delivery systems, kitchen wares, shoes, shoe bladders and shoe soles. In other<br><br>
embodiments, the polymer blends can be used to manufacture durable parts or articles that require a high tensile strength and low compression set In further embodiments, the polymer blends can be used to manufacture durable parts or articles that require a high upper service temperature and low modulus.<br>
[171]        The polymer blends can be used to prepare these durable parts or articles with known polymer processes such as extrusion (e.g., sheet extrusion and profile extrusion); molding (e.g., injection molding, rotational molding, and blow molding); fiber spinning; and blown film and cast film processes. In general, extrusion is a process by which a polymer is propelled continuously along a screw through regions of high temperature and pressure where it is melted and compacted, and finally forced through a die. The extruder can be a single screw extruder, a multiple screw extruder, a disk extruder or a ram extruder. The die can be a film die, blown film die, sheet die, pipe die, tubing die or profile extrusion die. The extrusion of polymers has been described in C. Rauwendaal, "Polymer Extrusion", Hanser Publishers, New York, NY (1986); and M.J. Stevens, "Extruder Principals and Operation" Ellsevier Applied Science Publishers, New York, NY (1985), both of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.<br>
[172]	Injection molding is also widely used for manufacturing a variety of<br>
plastic parts for various applications. In general, injection molding is a process by which a polymer is melted and injected at high pressure into a mold, which is the inverse of the desired shape, to form parts of the desired shape and size. The mold can be made from metal, such as steel and aluminum. The injection molding of polymers has been described in Beaumont et al., "Successful Injection Molding: Process, Design, and Simulation ,"Hanser Gardner Publications, Cincinnati, Ohio (2002), which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.<br>
[173]        Molding is generally a process by which a polymer is melted and led into a mold, which is the inverse of the desired shape, to form parts of the desired shape and size. Molding can be pressureless or pressure-assisted. The molding of polymers is described in Hans-Georg Elias "An Introduction to Plastics" Wiley-VCH, Weinhei, Germany, pp. 161-165 (2003), which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
[174J	Rotational molding is a process generally used for producing hollow<br>
plastic products. By using additional post-molding operations, complex components<br><br>
can be produced as effectively as other molding and extrusion techniques. Rotational molding differs from other processing methods in that the heating, melting, shaping, and cooling stages all occur after the polymer is placed in the mold, therefore no external pressure is applied during forming. The rotational molding of polymers has been described in Glenn Beall, "Rotational Molding: Design, Materials &amp; Processing" Hanser Gardner Publications, Cincinnati, Ohio (1998), which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.<br>
[175J	Blow molding can be used for making hollow plastics containers. The<br>
process includes placing a softened polymer in the center of a mold, inflating the polymer against the mold walls with a blow pin, and solidifying the product by cooling. There are three general types of blow molding: extrusion blow molding, injection blow molding, and stretch blow molding. Injection blow molding can be used to process polymers that cannot be extruded. Stretch blow molding can be used for difficult to blow crystalline and crystallizable polymers such as polypropylene.  The blow molding of polymers has been described in Norman C. Lee, "Understanding Blow Molding? Hanser Gardner Publications, Cincinnati, Ohio (2000), which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.<br>
[176]	The following examples are presented to exemplify embodiments of the<br>
invention. All numerical values are approximate. When numerical ranges are given, it should be understood that embodiments outside the stated ranges may still fall within the scope of the invention. Specific details described in each example should not be construed as necessary features of the invention.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
Testing Methods<br>
In the examples that follow, the following analytical techniques are employed: GPC Method for Samples 1-4 and A-C<br>
{177]        An automated liquid-handling robot equipped with a heated needle set to 160°C is used to add enough 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene stabilized with 300 ppm Ionol to each dried polymer sample to give a final concentration of 30 mg/mL. A small glass stir rod is placed into each tube and the samples are heated to 160°C for 2 hours on a heated, orbital-shaker rotating at 250 rpm. The concentrated polymer solution is then<br><br>
diluted to 1 mg/ml using the automated liquid-handling robot and the heated needle set to 160°C.<br>
[178]	A Syrnyx Rapid GPC system is used to determine the molecular weight<br>
data for each sample. A Gilson 350 pump set at 2.0 ml/min flow rate is used to pump helium-purged 1,2-dichlorobenzene stabilized with 300 ppm Ionol as the mobile phase through three Plgel 10 micrometer (\xm) Mixed B 300mm x 7.5mm columns placed in series and heated to 160°C. A Polymer Labs ELS 1000 Detector is used with the Evaporator set to 250°C, the Nebulizer set to 165°C, and the nitrogen flow rate set to 1.8 SLM at a pressure of 60-80 psi (400-600 kPa) N2. The polymer samples are heated to 160°C and each sample injected into a 250 nl loop using the liquid-handling robot and a heated needle. Serial analysis of the polymer samples using two switched loops and overlapping injections are used. The sample data is collected and analyzed using Symyx Epoch™ software. Peaks are manually integrated and the molecular weight information reported uncorrected against a polystyrene standard calibration curve.<br>
Standard CRYSTAF Method<br>
{179]	Branching distributions are determined by crystallization analysis<br>
fractionation (CRYSTAF) using a CRYSTAF 200 unit commercially available from PolymerChar, Valencia, Spain. The samples are dissolved in 1,2,4 trichlorobenzene at 160DC (0.66 mg/mL) for 1 hr and stabilized at 95°C for 45 minutes. The sampling temperatures range from 95 to 30°C at a cooling rate of 0.2°C/min. An infrared detector is used to measure the polymer solution concentrations. The cumulative soluble concentration is measured as the polymer crystallizes while the temperature is decreased. The analytical derivative of the cumulative profile reflects the short chain branching distribution of the polymer.<br>
[180]        The CRYSTAF peak temperature and area are identified by the peak analysis module included in the CRYSTAF Software (Version 2001.b, PolymerChar, Valencia, Spain). The CRYSTAF peak finding routine identifies a peak temperature as a maximum in the dW/dT curve and the area between the largest positive inflections on either side of the identified peak in the derivative curve. To calculate the CRYSTAF curve, the preferred processing parameters are with a temperature limit of 70°C and with smoothing parameters above die temperature limit of 0.1, and below the temperature limit of 0.3.<br><br>
DSC Standard Method (Excluding Samples 1-4 and A-C)<br>
[181]        Differential Scanning Calorimetry results are determined using aTAI model Q1000 DSC equipped with an RCS cooling accessory and an autosampler. A nitrogen purge gas flow of 50 ml/min is used. The sample is pressed into a thin film and melted in the press at about 175°C and then air-cooled to room temperature (25DC). 3-10 mg of material is then cut into a 6 mm diameter disk, accurately weighed, placed in a light aluminum pan (ca 50 mg), and then crimped shut. The thermal behavior of the sample is investigated with the following temperature profile. The sample is rapidly heated to 180°C and held isothermal for 3 minutes in order to remove any previous thermal history. The sample is then cooled to -40°C at 10°C/min cooling rate and held at -40°C for 3 minutes. The sample is then heated to 150 °C at 10°C/min. heating rate. The cooling and second heating curves are recorded.<br>
[182J	The DSC melting peak is measured as the maximum in heat flow rate<br>
(W/g) with respect to the linear baseline drawn between -30°C and end of melting. The heat of fusion is measured as the area under the melting curve between -30°C and the end of melting using a linear baseline.<br>
GPC Method (Excluding Samples 1-4 and A-C)<br>
[183]	The gel permeation chromatographic system consists of either a Polymer<br>
Laboratories Model PL-210 or a Polymer Laboratories Model PL-220 instrument. The column and carousel compartments are operated at 140 °C. Three Polymer Laboratories 10-micron Mixed-B columns are used. The solvent is 1,2,4 trichlorobenzene. The samples are prepared at a concentration of 0.1 grams of polymer in 50 milliliters of solvent containing 200 ppm of butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT). Samples are prepared by agitating lightly for 2 hours at 160°C. The injection volume used is 100 microliters and the flow rate is 1.0 ml/minute.<br>
[184]	Calibration of the GPC column set is performed with 21 narrow<br>
molecular weight distribution polystyrene standards with molecular weights ranging from 580 to 8,400,000, arranged in 6 "cocktail" mixtures with at least a decade of separation between individual molecular weights. The standards are purchased from Polymer Laboratories (Shropshire, UK). The polystyrene standards are prepared at 0.025 grams in 50 milliliters of solvent for molecular weights equal to or greater than 1,000,000, and 0.05 grams in 50 milliliters of solvent for molecular weights less than<br><br>
1,000,000. The polystyrene standards are dissolved at 80°C with gentle agitation for 30 minutes. The narrow standards mixtures are run first and in order of decreasing highest molecular weight component to minimize degradation. The polystyrene standard peak molecular weights are converted to polyethylene molecular weights using the following equation (as described in Williams and Ward, J. Polvm. Sci.. Polvm. Let.. 6, 621<br>
(1968)):   Mp0|yethylene = 0.43 1 (Mpolystyrene).<br>
[185]	Polyethylene equivalent molecular weight calculations are performed<br>
using Viscotek TriSEC software Version 3.0.<br>
Compression Set<br>
[186]	Compression set is measured according to ASTM D 395. The sample is<br>
prepared by stacking 25.4 mm diameter round discs of 3.2 mm, 2.0 mm, and 0.25 mm thickness until a total thickness of 12.7 nun is reached. The discs are cut from 12.7 cm x 12.7 cm compression molded plaques molded with a hot press under the following conditions: zero pressure for 3 min at 190°C, followed by 86 MPa for 2 min at 190°C, followed by cooling inside the press with cold running water at 86 MPa.<br>
Density<br>
1187J	Samples for density measurement are prepared according to ASTM D<br>
1928. Measurements are made within one hour of sample pressing using ASTM D792, Method B.<br>
Flexural/Seeant Modulus/ Storage Modulus<br>
[188]	Samples are compression molded using ASTM D 1928. Flexural and 2<br>
percent secant moduli are measured according to ASTM D-790. Storage modulus is measured according to ASTM D 5026-01 or equivalent technique.<br>
Optical properties<br>
[189]	Films of 0.4 mm thickness are compression molded using a hot press<br>
(Carver Model #4095-4PR1001R). The pellets are placed between polytetrailuoroethylene sheets, heated at 190 °C at 55 psi (380 kPa) for 3 min, followed by 1.3 MPa for 3 min, and then 2.6 MPa for 3 min. The film is then cooled in the press with running cold water at 1.3 MPa for 1 min. The compression molded films are used for optical measurements, tensile behavior, recovery, and stress relaxation.<br><br>
[190]        Clarity is measured using BYK Gardner Haze-gard as specified in ASTMD1746.<br>
[191]        45° gloss is measured using BYK Gardner Glossmeter Microgloss 45° as specified in ASTM D-2457<br>

ASTM D 1003 Procedure A. Mineral oil is applied to the film surface to remove surface scratches.<br>
Mechanical Properties - Tensile, Hysteresis, and Tear<br>
[193]	Stress-strain behavior in uniaxial tension is measured using ASTM D<br>
1708 microtensile specimens. Samples are stretched with an Instron at 500 % min"1 at 21°C. Tensile strength and elongation at break are reported from an average of 5 specimens.<br>
[1] 100% and 300% Hysteresis is determined from cyclic loading to 100% and 300% strains using ASTM D 1708 microtensile specimens with an Instron™ instrument. The sample is loaded and unloaded at 267 % min"1 for 3 cycles at 21°C. Cyclic experiments at 300% and 80°C are conducted using an environmental chamber. In the 80 °C experiment, the sample is allowed to equilibrate for 45 minutes at the test temperature before testing. In the 21 °C, 300% strain cyclic experiment, the retractive stress at 150% strain from the first unloading cycle is recorded. Percent recovery for all experiments are calculated from the first unloading cycle using the strain at which the load returned to the base line. The percent recovery is defined as:<br>

[195]	Stress relaxation is measured at 50 percent strain and 37 °C for 12 hours<br>
using an Instron™ instrument equipped with an environmental chamber. The gauge<br>
geometry was 76 mm x 25 mm x 0.4 mm. After equilibrating at 37°C for 45 min in the<br>
environmental chamber, the sample was stretched to 50% strain at 333% min"1. Stress<br>
was recorded as a function of time for 12 hours. The percent stress relaxation after 12<br>
hours was calculated using the formula:<br><br><br>
where Lo is the load at 50% strain at 0 time and L12 is the load at 50 percent strain after 12<br>
hours.<br>
[196]	Tensile notched tear experiments are carried out on samples having a<br>
density of 0.88 g/cc or less using an Instron™ instrument. The geometry consists of a<br>
gauge section of 76 mm x 13 mm x 0.4 mm with a 2 mm notch cut into the sample at<br>
half the specimen length. The sample is stretched at 508 mm min"1 at 21 °C until it<br>
breaks. The tear energy is calculated as the area under the stress-elongation curve up to<br>

TMA<br>
[197]	Thermal Mechanical Analysis (Penetration Temperature) is conducted<br>
on 30mm diameter x 3.3 mm thick, compression molded discs, formed at 180°C and 10 MPa molding pressure for 5 minutes and then air quenched. The instrument used is a TMA 7, brand available from Perkin-Elmer. In the test, a probe with 1.5 mm radius tip (P/N N519-0416) is applied to the surface of the sample disc with IN force. The temperature is raised at 5°C/min from 25°C. The probe penetration distance is measured as a function of temperature. The experiment ends when the probe has penetrated 1 mm into the sample.<br>
DMA<br>
[198|	Dynamic Mechanical Analysis (DMA) is measured on compression<br>
molded disks formed in a hot press at 180°C at 10 MPa pressure for 5 minutes and then water cooled in the press at 90°C / min. Testing is conducted using an ARES controlled strain rheometer (TA instruments) equipped with dual cantilever fixtures for torsion testing.<br>
[199]        A 1.5mm plaque is pressed and cut in a bar of dimensions 32x12mm. The sample is clamped at both ends between fixtures separated by 10mm (grip separation AL) and subjected to successive temperature steps from -100°C to 200°C (5°C per step). At each temperature the torsion modulus G' is measured at an angular frequency of 10 rad/s, the strain amplitude being maintained between 0.1 percent and 4 percent to ensure that the torque is sufficient and that the measurement remains in the linear regime.<br><br>
[1] An initial static force of 10 g is maintained (auto-tension mode) to prevent slack in the sample when thermal expansion occurs. As a consequence, the grip separation AL increases with the temperature, particularly above the melting or softening point of the polymer sample. The test stops at the maximum temperature or when the gap between the fixtures reaches 65 mm.<br>
Melt Index [201]        Melt index, or I2, is measured in accordance with ASTM D 1238, Condition 190°C/2.16 kg. Melt index, or I10 is also measured in accordance with ASTM D 1238, Condition 190°C/10 kg.<br>
ATREF [202]        Analytical temperature rising elution fractionation (ATREF) analysis is conducted according to the method described in USP 4,798,081 and Wilde, L.; Ryle, T.R.; Knobeloch, D.C.; Peat, I.R.; Determination of Branching Distributions in Polyethylene and Ethylene Copolymers, J. Polvm. ScL 20,441-455 (1982), which are incorporated by reference herein in their entirety. The composition to be analyzed is dissolved in trichlorobenzene and allowed to crystallize in a column containing an inert support (stainless steel shot) by slowly reducing the temperature to 20°C at a cooling rateof0.1°C/min. The column is equipped with an infrared detector. An ATREF chromatogram curve is then generated by eluting the crystallized polymer sample from the column by slowly increasing the temperature of the eluting solvent (trichlorobenzene) from 20 to 120°C at a rate of 1.5cC/min.<br>
IJC NMR Analysis<br>
[1] The samples are prepared by adding approximately 3g of a 50/50 mixture of tetrachloroethane-d2/orthodichlorobenzene to 0.4 g sample in a 10 mm NMR tube. The samples are dissolved and homogenized by heating the tube and its contents to 150°C. The data are collected using a JEOL ECLIPSE™ 400 MHz spectrometer or a Varian Unity PLUS™ 400 MHz spectrometer, corresponding to a I3C resonance frequency of 100.5 MHz. The data are acquired using 4000 transients per data file with a 6 second pulse repetition delay. To achieve minimum signal-to-noise for quantitative analysis, multiple data files are added together. The spectral width is 25,000 Hz with a minimum file size of 32K data points. The samples are analyzed at 130 °C in a 10 mm broad band probe. The comonomer incorporation is determined using Randall's triad method<br><br>

Polymer Fractionation by TREF<br>
[204]        Large-scale TREF fractionation is carried by dissolving 15-20 g of polymer in 2 liters of 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene (TCB)by stirring for 4 hours at 160°C. The polymer solution is forced by 15 psig (100 kPa) nitrogen onto a 3 inch by 4 foot (7.6 cm x 12 cm) steel column packed with a 60:40 (v:v) mix of 30-40 mesh (600-425 \im) spherical, technical quality glass beads (available from Potters Industries, HC 30 Box 20, Brownwood, TX, 76801) and stainless steel, 0.028" (0.7mm) diameter cut wire shot (available from Pellets, Inc. 63 Industrial Drive, North Tonawanda, NY, 14120). The column is immersed in a thermally controlled oil jacket, set initially to 160 °C. The column is first cooled ballistically to 125 °C, then slow cooled to 20 °C at 0.04 °C per minute and held for one hour. Fresh TCB is introduced at about 65 ml/min while the temperature is increased at 0.167 °C per minute.<br>
[205]	Approximately 2000 ml portions of eluant from the preparative TREF<br>
column are collected in a 16 station, heated fraction collector. The polymer is concentrated in each fraction using a rotary evaporator until about 50 to 100 ml of the polymer solution remains. The concentrated solutions are allowed to stand overnight before adding excess methanol, filtering, and rinsing (approx. 300-500 ml of methanol including the final rinse). The filtration step is performed on a 3 position vacuum assisted filtering station using 5.0 ^m polytetrafluoroethylene coated filter paper (available from Osmonics Inc., Cat# Z50WP04750). The filtrated fractions are dried overnight in a vacuum oven at 60 °C and weighed on an analytical balance before further testing.<br>
Melt Strength<br>
[206]	Melt Strength (MS) is measured by using a capillary rheometer fitted<br>
with a 2.1 mm diameter, 20:1 die with an entrance angle of approximately 45 degrees. After equilibrating the samples at 190°C for 10 minutes, the piston is run at a speed of 1 inch/minute (2.54 cm/minute). The standard test temperature is 190°C. The sample is drawn uniaxially to a set of accelerating nips located 100 mm below the die with an acceleration of 2.4 mm/sec2. The required tensile force is recorded as a function of the take-up speed of the nip rolls. The maximum tensile force attained during the test is<br><br>
defined as the melt strength. In the case of polymer melt exhibiting draw resonance, the tensile force before the onset of draw resonance was taken as melt strength. The melt strength is recorded in centiNewtons (McN").<br>

General High Throughput Parallel Polymerization Conditions [216]        Polymerizations are conducted using a high throughput, parallel polymerization reactor (PPR) available from Symyx technologies, Inc. and operated substantially according to USP's 6,248,540, 6,030,917, 6,362,309, 6,306,658, and 6,316,663. Ethylene copolymerizations are conducted at 130°C and 200 psi (1.4 MPa) with ethylene on demand using 1.2 equivalents of cocatalyst 1 based on total catalyst used (1.1 equivalents when MMAO is present). A series of polymerizations are conducted in a parallel pressure reactor (PPR) contained of 48 individual reactor cells in a 6 x 8 array that are fitted with a pre-weighed glass tube. The working volume in each reactor cell is.6000 \xL. Each cell is temperature and pressure controlled with stirring provided by individual stirring paddles. The monomer gas and quench gas are plumbed directly into the PPR unit and controlled by automatic valves. Liquid reagents are robotically added to each reactor cell by syringes and the reservoir solvent is mixed alkanes. The order of addition is mixed alkanes solvent (4 ml), ethylene, 1-octene comonomer (1 ml), cocatalyst 1 or cocatalyst 1/MMAO mixture, shuttling agent, and catalyst or catalyst mixture. When a mixture of cocatalyst 1 and MMAO or a mixture of two catalysts is used, the reagents are premixed in a small vial immediately prior to addition to the reactor. When a reagent is omitted in an experiment, the above order of addition is otherwise maintained. Polymerizations are conducted for approximately 1-2 minutes, until predetermined ethylene consumptions are reached. After quenching with CO, the reactors are cooled and the glass tubes are unloaded. The tubes are transferred to a centrifuge/vacuum drying unit, and dried for 12 hours at 60 °C. The tubes containing dried polymer are weighed and the difference between this weight and the tare weight gives the net yield of polymer. Results are contained in Table 1. In Table 1 and elsewhere in the application, comparative compounds are indicated by an asterisk<br>
[217]	Examples 1-4 demonstrate the synthesis of linear block copolymers by<br>
the present invention as evidenced by the formation of a very narrow MWD, essentially monomodal copolymer when DEZ is present and a bimodal, broad molecular weight distribution product (a mixture of separately produced polymers) in the absence of DEZ. Due to the fact that Catalyst (Al) is known to incorporate more octene than<br><br>
Catalyst (Bl), the different blocks or segments of the resulting copolymers of the invention are distinguishable based on branching or density.<br><br>
[218J It may be seen the polymers produced according to the invention have a relatively narrow polydispersity (Mw/Mn) and larger block-copolymer content (trimer, tetramer, or larger) than polymers prepared in the absence of the shuttling agent.<br>

Examples 5-19. Comparative Examples D»-F*. Continuous Solution Polymerization, Catalyst A1/B2 4-DEZ<br>
[1] Continuous solution polymerizations are carried out in a computer controlled autoclave reactor equipped with an internal stirrer. Purified mixed alkanes solvent (ISOPAR™ E available from ExxonMobil Chemical Company), ethylene at 2.70 lbs/hour (1.22 kg/hour), 1-octene, and hydrogen (where used) are supplied to a 3.8 L reactor equipped with a jacket for temperature control and an internal thermocouple. The solvent feed to the reactor is measured by a mass-flow controller. A variable speed diaphragm pump controls the solvent flow rate and pressure to the reactor. At the discharge of the pump, a side stream is taken to provide flush flows for the catalyst and cocatalyst 1 injection lines and the reactor agitator. These flows are measured by Micro-Motion mass flow meters and controlled by control valves or by the manual adjustment of needle valves. The remaining solvent is combined with 1-octene,<br><br>
ethylene, and hydrogen (where used) and fed to the reactor. A mass flow controller is used to deliver hydrogen to the reactor as needed. The temperature of the solvent/monomer solution is controlled by use of a heat exchanger before entering the reactor. This stream enters the bottom of the reactor. The catalyst component solutions are metered using pumps and mass flow meters and are combined with the catalyst flush solvent and introduced into the bottom of the reactor. The reactor is run liquid-full at 500 psig (3.45 MPa) with vigorous stirring. Product is removed through exit lines at the top of the reactor. All exit lines from the reactor are steam traced and insulated. Polymerization is stopped by the addition of a small amount of water into the exit line along with any stabilizers or other additives and passing the mixture through a static mixer. The product stream is then heated by passing through a heat exchanger before devolatilization. The polymer product is recovered by extrusion using a devolatilizing extruder and water cooled pelletizer. Process details and results are contained in Table 2.

Example J* is a hydrogenated styrene/butadiene/styrene triblock copolymer (KRATON™ G1652, available from KRATON Polymers), Comparative Example K* is a thermoplastic vulcanizate (TPV, a polyolefin blend containing dispersed therein a crosslinked elastomer). Results are presented in Table 4.<br><br>
[22]	In Table 4, Comparative Example F* (which is a physical blend of the<br>
two polymers resulting from simultaneous polymerizations using catalyst Al and B I) has a 1 mm penetration temperature of about 70°C, while Examples 5-9 have a 1 mm penetration temperature of 100°C or greater. Further, examples 10-19 all have a 1 mm penetration temperature of greater than 85°C, with most having I mm TMA temperature of greater than 90°C or even greater than 100°C. This shows that the novel polymers have better dimensional stability at higher temperatures compared to a physical blend. Comparative Example J* (a commercial SEBS) has a good 1 mm TMA' temperature of about 107°C, but it has very poor (high temperature 70°C) compression set of about 100 percent and it also failed to recover (sample broke) during a high<br><br>
temperature (80°C) 300 percent strain recovery. Thus the exemplified polymers have a unique combination of properties unavailable even in some commercially available, high performance thermoplastic elastomers.<br>
[23]	Similarly, Table 4 shows a low (good) storage modulus ratio,<br>
G*(25oC)/G'(100oC), for the inventive polymers of 6 or less, whereas a physical blend (Comparative Example F*) has a storage modulus ratio of 9 and a random ethylene/octene copolymer (Comparative Example G*) of similar density has a storage modulus ratio an order of magnitude greater (89). It is desirable that the storage modulus ratio of a polymer be as close to 1 as possible. Such polymers will be relatively unaffected by temperature, and fabricated articles made from such polymers can be .usefully employed over a broad temperature range. This feature of low storage modulus ratio and temperature independence is particularly useful in elastomer applications such as in pressure sensitive adhesive formulations.<br>
[24]	The data in Table 4 also demonstrate that the polymers of the invention<br>
possess improved pellet blocking strength. In particular, Example 5 has a pellet blocking strength of 0 MPa, meaning it is free flowing under the conditions tested, compared to Comparative Examples F* and G* which show considerable blocking. Blocking strength is important since bulk shipment of polymers having large blocking strengths can result in product clumping or sticking together upon storage or shipping, resulting in poor handling properties.<br>
[25]	High temperature (70°C) compression set for the inventive polymers is<br>
generally good, meaning generally less than about 80 percent, preferably less than about 70 percent and especially less than about 60 percent. In contrast, Comparative Examples F*, G*, H* and J* all have a 70°C compression set of 100 percent (the maximum possible value, indicating no recovery). Good high temperature compression set (low numerical values) is especially needed for applications such as gaskets, window profiles, o-rings, and the like.<br><br><br><br>
[26]	Table 5 shows results for mechanical properties for the new polymers as<br>
well as for various comparison polymers at ambient temperatures. It may be seen that the inventive polymers have very good abrasion resistance when tested according to ISO 4649, generally showing a volume loss of less than about 90 mm3, preferably less than about 80 mm3, and especially less than about 50 mm3. In this test, higher numbers indicate higher volume loss and consequently lower abrasion resistance.<br>
[27]	Tear strength as measured by tensile notched tear strength of the<br>
inventive polymers is generally 1000 mJ or higher, as shown in Table 5. Tear strength for the inventive polymers can be as high as 3000 mJ, or even as high as 5000 mJ. Comparative polymers generally have tear strengths no higher than 750 mJ.<br>
[28]	Table 5 also shows that the polymers of the invention have better<br>
retractive stress at 150 percent strain (demonstrated by higher retractive stress values) than some of the comparative samples. Comparative Examples F*, G* and H* have retractive stress value at 150 percent strain of 400 kPa or less, while the inventive polymers have retractive stress values at 150 percent strain of 500 kPa (Ex. 11) to as high as about 1100 kPa (Ex. 17). Polymers having higher than 150 percent retractive stress values would be quite useful for elastic applications, such as elastic fibers and fabrics, especially nonwoven fabrics. Other applications include diaper, hygiene, and medical garment waistband applications, such as tabs and elastic bands.<br>
[29]	Table 5 also shows that stress relaxation (at 50 percent strain) is also<br>
improved (less) for the inventive polymers as compared to, for example, Comparative Example G*. Lower stress relaxation means that the polymer retains its force better in applications such as diapers and other garments where retention of elastic properties over long time periods at body temperatures is desired.<br><br><br>
[30]	The optical properties reported in Table 6 are based on compression<br>
molded films substantially lacking in orientation. Optical properties of the polymers may be varied over wide ranges, due to variation in crystallite size, resulting from variation in the quantity of chain shuttling agent employed in the polymerization.<br>
Extractions of Multi-Block Copolymers<br>
[31]	Extraction studies of the polymers of Examples 5, 7 and Comparative<br>
Example E* are conducted. In the experiments, the polymer sample is weighed into a glass fritted extraction thimble and fitted into a Kumagawa type extractor. The extractor with sample is purged with nitrogen, and a 500mL round bottom flask is charged with 350 mL of diethyl ether. The flask is then fitted to the extractor. The ether is heated while being stirred. Time is noted when the ether begins to condense into the thimble, and the extraction is allowed to proceed under nitrogen for 24 hours. At this time, heating is stopped and the solution is allowed to cool. Any ether remaining in the extractor is returned to the flask. The ether in the flask is evaporated under vacuum at ambient temperature, and the resulting solids are purged dry with nitrogen. Any residue is transferred to a weighed bottle using successive washes of<br><br>
hexane. The combined hexane washes are then evaporated with another nitrogen purge, and the residue dried under vacuum overnight at 40°C. Any remaining ether in the extractor is purged dry with nitrogen.<br>
[32]	A second clean round bottom flask charged with 350 raL of hexane is<br>
then connected to the extractor. The hexane is heated to reflux with stirring and maintained at reflux for 24 hours after hexane is first noticed condensing into the thimble. Heating is then stopped and the flask is allowed to cool. Any hexane remaining in the extractor is transferred back to the flask. The hexane is removed by evaporation under vacuum at ambient temperature, and any residue remaining in the flask is transferred to a weighed bottle using successive hexane washes. The hexane in the flask is evaporated by a nitrogen purge, and the residue is vacuum dried overnight at 40°C.<br>
[33]	The polymer sample remaining in the thimble after the extractions is<br>
transferred from the thimble to a weighed bottle and vacuum dried overnight at 40°C. Results are contained in Table 7.<br><br>
Additional Polymer Examples 19 A-F, Continuous Solution Polymerization, Catalyst A1/B2 + DEZ<br>
[34]	Continuous solution polymerizations are carried out in a computer<br>
controlled well-mixed reactor. Purified mixed alkanes solvent (ISOPAR™ E available from ExxonMobil Chemical Company), ethylene, l-octene, and hydrogen (where used) are combined and fed to a 27 gallon reactor. The feeds to the reactor are measured by mass-flow controllers. The temperature of the feed stream is controlled by use of a glycol cooled heat exchanger before entering the reactor. The catalyst component solutions are metered using pumps and mass flow meters. The reactor is run liquid-full at approximately 550 psig pressure. Upon exiting the reactor, water and additive are<br><br>
injected in the polymer solution. The water hydrolyzes the catalysts, and terminates the polymerization reactions. The post reactor solution is then heated in preparation for a two-stage devolatization. The solvent and unreacted monomers are removed during the devolatization process. The polymer melt is pumped to a die for underwater pellet cutting.<br>

inventive ethylene/octene copolymer having a Zn level of 517 ppm, a density of 0.877 g/cc and a melt index (h) of 5. Comparative Example Z2 was 100% of Polymer 19k.

Polymer 191 was an inventive ethylene/octene copolymer having a density of 0.877 g/cc and a melt index (I2) of 30. Comparative Example Z4 was 100% of Polymer 19m. Polymer 19m was an inventive ethylene/octene copolymer having a Zn level of 255 ppm, a density of 0.866 g/cc and a melt index (I2) of 5. Polymers 19j, 19k, 191 and 19m were prepared substantially similarly to Examples 1-19 and Example 19a-19h. One skilled in the art knows how to manipulate process conditions, such as shuttling agent ratios, hydrogen flow, monomer concentration, etc., to make a target polymer using the process conditions already detailed in the instant application.<br>
Examples 46-57<br>
[57]	Example 46 was a blend of 90% of Polymer 19m and 10% of PROFAX®<br>
PF814, a HMS-PP from Basell Polyolefins, Elkton, MD, Example 47 was a blend of 85% ofPolymerl9mand 15% of PROFAX® PF814. Example 48 was a blend of 95% of Polymer 19m and 5% of PROFAX® PF814. Example 49 was a blend of 95% of Polymer 19j and 5% of PROFAX® PF814. Example 50 was a blend of 90% of Polymer 19j and 10% of PROFAX® PF814. Example 51 was a blend of 85% of Polymer 19j and 15% of PROFAX® PF814. Example 52 was a blend of 85% of Polymer 19k and 15% of PROFAX18* PF814. Example 53 was a blend of 90% of Polymer 19k and 10% of PROFAX® PF814. Example 54 was a blend of 95% of Polymer 19k and 5% of PROFAX® PF814. Example 55 was a blend of 95% of Polymer 191 and 5% of PROFAX® PF814.<br><br>
Example 56 was a blend of 90% of Polymer 191 and 10% of PROF AX* PF814. Example 57 was a blend of 85% of Polymer 191 and 15% of PROFAX® PF814.<br>
[58]	Comparative Examples Z1-Z4 and Examples 46-57 were dry blended (if a<br>
blend) and then injection molded using a 80 ton Arburg 370C injection molding machine (available from ARBURG GmbH + Co KG, Lossburg, Germany) into a 4 inch by 6 inch by 0.125 inch test plaque. The mold had a polished smooth surface and used a cold runner through a fan gate. The molding conditions were held constant at 23 seconds total cycle time (to test the ability of the resins to solidify quickly).<br>
[59]	Comparative Examples Z1-Z4 and Examples 46-57 were injection molded<br>
as described above into plaques or parts, which were subsequently sujbected to "Parts Stick in Mold" test, "Parts Initially Stick Together" test, Shore A hardness, "Part Quality" test and "Aged Part Tackiness'* test.<br>
[60]	The "Parts Stick in Mold" test included observing whether the molded parts<br>
adhered to the mold surfaces and would not be ejected from the mold, A "Yes" rating is unfavorable and means that the molded parts did stick in the mold and required manual extraction. A "No" is favorable and means that the molded parts did not stick in the mold and fell to the conveyor system without manual extraction. In the "Parts Initially Stick Together" test, two molded parts of each sample immediately after injection molding were placed on top of each other; hand pressure was applied; and then the molded parts were pulled away from each other. The amount of force required to remove the two parts from each other was measured. A rating for each pair was given from 3 (best, no sticking, no force required to remove the two samples) to 1 (worse, excessive sticking, substantial hand force was required to removed the two samples). The molded parts were then set aside and laid flat for 24 hours. After 24 hours, the Shore A hardness of each molded part was measured according to ASTM D2240, which is incorporated herein by reference. The average of two Shore A hardness readings for each sample were recorded. Further, each molded part was graded for "Part Quality" and "Aged Part Tackiness." The "Part Quality" was rated from 5 (best, absolute perfect part without voids, warpage, shrinkage) to 1 (worse, excessive voids, a warped parts, excessive shrinkage). The "Aged Part Tackiness" was tested by placing two molded parts on top of each other; applying hand pressure, and pulling the parts away from each other. The amount of force required to remove the two parts from each other was measured. A rating of each pair was given from 5 (best, no sticking, no force required to remove the two samples) to 1 (worse, excessive sticking,<br><br><br><br>
[61]	The test data in Table 13 indicate that the tackiness and hardness of the<br>
inventive the ethylene/a-olefin interpolymers (e.g., Polymers 19j, 19k, 191, and 19m) can be improved by blending each of them with a HMS-PP such as PROFAX® PF814.<br>
[62]	Some of the polymer blends disclosed herein can provide a better<br>
combination of moldability, appealing appearance, non-stickiness and mechanical properties than any of the components of the polymer blends alone. For example, Examples 21-26, which are polymer blends of Polymer 19f and at least one other polymer, demonstrate a better balance of flexural modulus, tear strength, and 0.1 mm pentration temperature by TMA than those of Polymer 19f alone (/.*., Example 20) or Comparative Examples M-P, which are not polymer blends. Similarly, the polymer blends comprising Polymer 19a, 19b or 19i (Ley Examples 34-36, 38-40 and 42-44) has a better balance of 1 mm pentration temperature by TMA and elastic recovery than KRATON® G1652, AFFINITY® EG8100orthe corresponding Polymer 19a, 19b or 19i alone. Similarly, the polymer blends comprising Polymer 19j, 19k, 191 or 19m (i.e, Examples 46-57) has a better balance of tackiness (i.e., lower tackiness) and hardness (i.e, higher hardness) than the corresponding Polymer 19j, 19k, 191 or 19m alone.<br>
[63]	As demonstrated above, embodiments of the invention provide various<br>
polymer blends which possess unique physical and mechanical properties that are suitable for making molded articles for a variety of applications. The blends have relatively low modulus, while maintaining relatively high heat resistance. Such balance of properties makes the blends suitable for making flexible molded articles. Moreover, some blends exhibit little or no stickiness in the surface.<br>
