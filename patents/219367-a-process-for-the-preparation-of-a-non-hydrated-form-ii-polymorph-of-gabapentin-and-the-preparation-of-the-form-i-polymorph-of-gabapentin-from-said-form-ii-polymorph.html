				<td>"A PROCESS FOR THE PREPARATION OF A NON-HYDRATED FORM II<br>
POLYMORPH OF GABAPENTIN AND THE PREPARATION OF THE FORM I<br>
POLYMORPH OF GABAPENTIN FROM SAID FORM II POLYMORPH<br>
DESCRIPTION<br>
Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of a<br>
non-hydrated Form II polymorph of gabapentin and the preparation of the<br>
Form I polymorph of gabapentin from said Form II polymorph.<br>
Prior art reference<br>
Gabapentin is a synthetic amino acid related to ?-aminobutyric acid<br>
(GABA) responding to the chemical name of 1-(aminomethyl) cyclohexane<br>
acetic acid (The Merck Index, Ed. XII) and the following formula<br><br>
The said compound has a therapeutical activity for convulsive type<br>
cerebral disorders, such as epilepsy, hypokinesia, including fainting, and<br>
other brain trauma and, in general, it is deemed to produce an<br>
improvement of the cerebral functions.<br>
Gabapentin and several processes for the preparation thereof are<br>
described in Spanish patent ES-A-443 723, corresponding to US-A-4 024<br>
175, Example 1 of which describes the preparation of the free amino acid<br>
from the hydrochloride thereof, by treatment of an aqueous solution thereof<br>
with a basic ion exchanger, evaporation of the solvent and subsequent<br>
crystallisation from ethanol/ether.<br>
The thus obtained product corresponds to a non-hydrated<br>
crystalline form coinciding with the one shown by the commercial<br>
pharmaceutical Neurontin® which is the pharmaceutical standard for<br>
gabapentin.<br>
On the other hand, EP-B-0 340 677 and the Spanish part thereof,<br>
ES-T3-2 061 774, disclose a new hydrated form of gabapentin<br>
characterised by its X-ray diffraction data and the process for the<br>
preparation thereof, as well as a process for preparing the non-hydrated<br>
crystalline form requiring the prior preparation of the said hydrated form.<br>
Said process consists of the following successive steps:<br>
a) passinganaqueousgabapentinhydrochloridesolution<br>
through a basic ion exchange column.<br>
b) concentrating the eluate to form a suspension.<br>
c) cooling and adding alcohol to the above suspension.<br>
d) cooling and centrifuging the thus prepared suspension.<br>
e) drying the product obtained, which is the hydrated form of<br>
gabapentin.<br>
f) dissolving the above pure hydrated form in methanol.<br>
g) diluting and cooling the thus prepared solution until a<br>
suspension is obtained.<br>
h)centrifuging the suspension and drying the product, which is<br>
the non-hydrated form of gabapentin.<br>
The above described process is obviously complicated from the,<br>
industrial point of view, since it requires several steps and the isolation of<br>
an intermediate in pure form, the hydrated form, prior to a final<br>
crystallisation. All of this leads to an excessive occupation of the industrial<br>
plant and losses in the yield of the desired product.<br>
There is, therefore, a need to develop alternative processes for the<br>
preparation of non-hydrated pharmaceutical grade gabapentin allowing the<br>
industrial preparation of the product to be simplified, with a consequent<br>
reduction of the production costs.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide an non-hydrated<br>
gabapentin polymorph allowing pharmaceutical grade gabapentin to be<br>
prepared in an industrially improved way over the prior art.<br>
It is also an object of the invention to provide a process for the<br>
preparation of said polymorph and a process for the preparation of<br>
pharmaceutical grade gabapentin from said polymorph.<br>
Brief Description of the Drawings<br>
Figure 1 is an IR spectrum of the non-hydrated gabapentin<br>
polymorph of the invention, using KBr tablet.<br>
Figure 2 is an X-ray diffraction diagram of said polymorph, with a<br>
diffraction angle coverage ranging from 4° to 50° in 0.02° steps.<br>
Detailed Description<br>
The present inventors have discovered that by drying an aqueous<br>
solution of gabapentin using spray-drying or turbo-drying techniques, a new<br>
non-hydrated gabapentin polymorph is obtained and which has been<br>
named Form II by the inventors. The IR spectrum, on KBr tablet, is shown<br>
in Figure 1 and the X-ray diffraction diagram with a diffraction angle<br>
coverage ranging from 4° to 50° in 0.02° steps is shown in Figure 2.<br>
Table 1 gives numerically the spacing "d" in A and the relative<br>
intensity I (%) of the said X-ray diffraction diagram, for the peaks having a<br>
relative intensity equal or superior to 5.<br>
In turn, for comparative purposes, the X-ray diffraction diagram<br>
corresponding to the pharmaceutical grade gabapentin standard, which the<br>
present inventors have named Form 1, obtained under the same conditions,<br>
gives the results listed in Table 2.<br>
Having regard to the IR spectrum, the most significant bands of the<br>
new Form II polymorph, in comparison with the Form I polymorph, may be<br>
said to be those occurring at 1576, 1522, 985 and 637 cm-1.<br>
The present inventors have also found that when the new Form II<br>
polymorph is crystallised out of conventional solvents, there is surprisingly<br>
obtained pharmaceutical grade non-hydrated gabapentin, i.e. the Form I<br>
polymorph is obtained with a high degree of purity and a high yield.<br>
Thus, pharmaceutical grade Form gabapentin may be obtained on<br>
an industrial scale without it being necessary previously to prepare a pure<br>
hydrated form thereof, by a process, also an object of the invention,<br>
consisting essentially of crystallising the non-hydrated gabapentin Form II<br>
polymorph in a conventional solvent or mixture of solvents.<br>
The aqueous gabapentin starting solution for preparing the Form II<br>
polymorph may be prepared by the method described in any of the<br>
aforementioned documents ES-A-443 723 and EP-B-0 340 677. The<br>
concentration of the solution may range from 2% to 11% by weight,<br>
although concentrations ranging from 5% to 7% by weight are to be<br>
preferred.<br>
The gabapentin solution is not dried by conventional evaporation of<br>
the solvent, but by spray-drying or turbo-drying techniques, in equipment<br>
well known to the man of the art.<br>
The air inlet temperature to the spray drier or turbo-drier may range<br>
from 100° C to 200° C, preferably from 105° C to 110° C and the exit<br>
temperature may range from 60° C to 120° C, preferably from 75° C to 85°<br>
C.<br>
As previously mentioned, the Form II polymorph is converted to the<br>
Form I polymorph by conventional crystallisation methods by using also<br>
conventional solvents, although the short chain alcohols and/or mixtures of<br>
these alcohols with water are preferred. The presence of small amounts of<br>
water in the crystallisation process allows smaller volumes to be used, with<br>
the consequent saving, and provides pharmaceutical grade gabapentin<br>
(Form I) of a high degree of purity. Methanol, ethanol and isopropanol may<br>
be cited among the most preferred alcohols.<br>
The following Examples are provided for the purpose of giving the<br>
man of the art a sufficiently clear and complete explanation of the present<br>
invention, but must not be deemed to be limitations on the essential<br>
aspects of the object of the invention, such as those indicated in the<br>
foregoing paragraphs hereof.<br>
Examples<br>
Example 1<br>
Following the method described in Example 1 of EP-B-0 340 677,<br>
1.5 L of an aqueous solution of gabapentin containing 73.8 g/L was<br>
obtained. Said solution was dried using a type A/S spray-drier, supplied by<br>
NIRO, under the following conditions: flowrate 5.80 L/h, air input<br>
temperature 106-109° C and exit temperature 77-78° C. 101.8 g of non-<br>
hydrated gabapentin, Form II, were obtained in the form of a white powder<br>
having a melting point of 164-5° C, a specific gravity of 0.502 g/mL and a<br>
chromatographic purity (HPLC) of 99.3%. The gabapentin obtained showed<br>
a solid state (KBr) infra red spectrum and an X-ray diffract/on spectrum in<br>
powder conforming to those given in Figures 1 and 2 and in Table 1.<br>
An aliquot (10.2 g) of the Form II gabapentin obtained was<br>
dissolved in a mixture of 89 mL of methanol and 1 mL of water at a<br>
temperature of 60°-65° C. The resulting solution was cooled to 20° C and<br>
the appearance of a white precipitate was observed. 90 mL of isopropanol<br>
were added, with subsequent cooling to 0°-5° C and stirring was continued<br>
at that temperature for 4 hours. The precipitate was filtered and dried, to<br>
give 8.4 g (82%) of Form I gabapentin, with a chromatographic purity<br>
(HPLC) of 99.7%. The X-ray diffraction data conform to those given in<br>
Table 2.<br>
Example 2<br>
When operating in the same way as described in example 1, but<br>
with the following variations: gabapentin solution concentration 6% by<br>
weight, spray drier flowrate 9 L/h, air input temperature 170°-180° C and air<br>
exit temperature 110°-115° C, non-hydrated Form II gabapentin was<br>
prepared, with a chromatographic purity (HPLC) of 92.6%, with the solid<br>
state (KBr) infra red ray spectrum and powder X-ray diffraction spectrum<br>
being in agreement with those given in Figures 1 and 2 and Table 1.<br>
Example 3<br>
900 mL of a 6% by weight aqueous solution of gabapentin were<br>
evaporated in a Rinajet® turbo-drier, under the following conditions:<br>
flowrate 0.45 L/h, air input temperature 120°-130° C and air exit<br>
temperature 80°-85° C. Non-hydrated Form II gabapentin was prepared,<br>
with a chromatographic purity (HPLC) of 94.6%, with the solid state (KBr)<br>
infra red ray spectrum and powder X-ray diffraction spectrum thereof being<br>
in agreement with those given in Figures 1 and 2 and Table 1.<br>
Example 4<br>
Following the method described in Example 1 of EP-B-0 340 677,<br>
1.5 L of an aqueous solution of gabapentin containing 73.8 g/L was<br>
obtained. Said solution was dried using a type A/S spray-drier, supplied by<br>
NIRO, under the following conditions: flowrate 7.33 L/h, air input<br>
temperature 140-143° C and exit temperature 92-95° C. The product<br>
obtained was gabapentin Form II, the infra red spectrum and X-ray<br>
diffraction spectrum thereof being in agreement with those given in Figures<br>
1 and 2 and in Table 1.<br>
Example 5<br>
10.2 g of the Form II gabapentin obtained in Example 4 were<br>
dissolved in a mixture of 94 mL of methanol and 1 mL of water at a<br>
temperature of 64° C. The resulting solution was cooled to 20°-25° C and<br>
the appearance of a white precipitate was observed. 90 mL of isopropanol<br>
were added, with subsequent cooling to 0°-5° C and stirring was continued<br>
at that temperature for 4 hours. The precipitate was filtered and dried, to<br>
give 7.7 g (75%) of Form I gabapentin, with a chromatographic purity<br>
(HPLC) of 99.7%. The X-ray diffraction data conform to those given in<br>
Table 2.<br>
Example 6<br>
10.1 g of the Form II gabapentin obtained in Example 4 were<br>
dissolved in a mixture of 94 mL of ethanol and 1 mL of water at a<br>
temperature of 79° C. The resulting solution was cooled to 0°-5° C and<br>
stirring was continued at that temperature for 3 hours 15 minutes. The<br>
precipitate was filtered and dried, to give 8,3 g (82%) of Form J gabapentin,<br>
with a chromatographic purity (HPLC) of 99.3%. The X-ray diffraction data<br>
conform to those given in Table 2.<br>
