				<td>This invention relates to a carton for storage and dispensing a particular, granular and leaf materials. The carton of the present invention has a particular-application to storage and dispensing of tea leaves. However., reference to tea leaves is only by way of Example and without intending to imply any limitation thereto in that the carton of the present invention may also be advantageously be employed for other materials.<br>
Cartons for storage and dispensing of tea leaves are generally known in the art. Such cartons comprise an outer body of board material with an inner liner disposed therein. The carton has major and minor flaps at. the upper and lower end, such flaps being identical in construction to each other.<br>
A disadvantage associated with such a known construction of a carton is that for a dispensing of the contents contained within the carton it is necessary to tear the flaps at. the open end. Alternatively, it is necessary to open the upper flaps and the i nn e r 1i n i ng.<br>
Another  disadvantage is that once the?  carton is  opened,,  it  no  longer  prevents  the  ingress   of moisture.<br><br>
An object of this invention is to propose an improved construction of a carton.<br>
Another object of this invention is to propose a carton which obviates the disadvantages associated with the prior art.<br>
Still another object of this invention is to propose a carton which has an integrally formed spout.<br>
Yet another object of this invention is to propose a carton which prevents the ingress of moisture even when the carton is in an open condition.<br>
According to this invention there is provided a carton for storage of particulate granular and leaf material comprising an outer body made of any known board material with a liner disposed therein, said outer body having major and minor flaps at the lower and upper end of said outer body, characterised in that the height of the minor flaps at the upper end is identical to that of the major flaps, said carton having a spout zone formed at a corner of one of the major flaps at the upper and extending into an adjacent minor flap and such as to form a spout when the tear zone is urged outwardly.<br><br>
In accordance with this invention spout zone is formed by a weak or perforated line in said back major flap extending into said adjacent minor flap and by a foldable line at the base of said spout zone.<br>
The inner liner is adhered to said back major flap and to the two minor flaps.<br>
Further objects and advantages of this invention will be more apparent from the ensuing description when read in conjunction with the accompanying drawings and wherein: -<br>
Fig. 1     shows the carton before formation of the carton in a sealed<br>
Condition, Fig.2     shows the carton in a semi sealed condition, and<br>
Fig.3     shows the carton in a sealed and closed condition, and<br>
Fig.4     shows the carton with the spout.<br>
Referring to the drawings and with particular reference to Fig.l, carton 1 comprises and outer envelope 2 with an inner liner 3. Carton 1 has an upper or discharge end 4 and a sealed or lower end 5, each of said ends having major and minor flaps 6 and 7 at the upper end and major and minor flaps 8 and 9 at the lower end.<br><br>
The inner liner 3 is adhered or sealed to the inner surface of outer envelope 2 and in a manner known as such in the art. Outer envelope 2 is made of board or any other material which in a likewise manner is known in the art.<br>
In the known art, the construction of the flaps at lower end 5 of carton 1 is identical to that at the upper end 4. However, in accordance with the present invention, the construction of the flaps at lower end 5 is different to that at upper end 4. Further, and in the known construction,, the contents within carton 1 could be discharged by opening the flpas at. the upper end 4 and then by tearing the inner lining 3. Such a disadvantage? is obviated by carton 1 of the present invention and when it is no longer necessary to open or tear the flaps at the? upper end 4, which has a spout opened into an operation position so as to facilitate a discharge of the contents. Such apout is provided by the particular construction of the flaps at upper end 4 of carton 1.<br>
In  accordance  with the  present  invention, flaps  8  and  9  at  lower  end  of  carton  1  have  a<br><br>
construction already known in the airt. Thus, at lower end 5, inner liner 3 is stretched longitudinally and the free ends are heat sealed. The sealed liner is folded, with minor flaps 9 closed and then major flaps 8 closed after applying an adhesine thereto. Such a manner of closing lower end 5 is known in the art. In the known construction., and once the contents were filled into carton 1, flaps at the upper end 4 were closed in a s i m i 1 a r m a n n e r n<br>
In  accordance with this invention  the  back major flap 6ta forms an integral member with minor  flaps 7,  The two minor flaps 7 have a construction  identical to  each other.  Back major flap 6b has a spout zone  10 at one corner and which* extends into the adjacent minor /      flap  and  which  forms a spout 11.  Spout  zone  10  is<br>
   formed  by a tear line 12 extending from major  flap  6b<br><br>
into  the  adjacent  minor flap 7 and  a  fold  .1.3  also<br>
 extending from flap 6b into minor flap 7,<br>
Inner line 3 is adhered to flap 6b and the two minor flaps, but not to front major flap 6a. In such a manner,, moisture is prevented to ingres into carton 1„<br><br>
Minor flap 7 has a cut section 14 extending from the base foldable base 13 and extending upwardly to a tongue 15 formed by weak lines 16. Front major flap 6 has a cut section 17 only on one side, said cut section having a height corresponding substantially to that of tongue 15.<br>
Minor flaps 7 have a height corresponding to that of major flaps 6. However, liner 3 extends outwardly of the flaps when carton 1 is in an unsealed condition.<br>
Minor flaps a triangular member 18, one of the sides of said triangular member have a foldable line 19, the opposite side being formed by cut section 14.<br>
For closing of carton 1 at upper end 4, minor flaps are folded vertically and along weak line 16 and towards back major flap 6b. The upper ends of inner liner 3 is sealed. In such a position, the minor flaps 7 and major back flap 6b forms a single member, which is then folded downwardly and front major flap 6a folded over said back major flap 6b and adhered thereto.<br><br>
In a sealed condition the cut section 17<br>
of front major flap allows spout zone 1O to be in an exposed state. Thus, for a discharge,, spout zone 1O is torn at. weak zone 12 and spout zone 10 urged outwardly to form the spout.<br><br><br>
