DISPOSABLE SYRINGE GUARDED IN A PREUSE POSITION<br>
This invention relates to a disposable syringe, more<br>
particularly to a disposable syringe which has a spacer to<br>
guard a plunger against undesired movement to a needle<br>
retraction initiating position so as to guard the syringe<br>
in a preuse position.<br>
Conventional medical devices or syringes for injection<br>
medicine, drawing blood samples, etc., have to be disposed<br>
of safely after injection in order to avoid accidental needle<br>
pricks or undesirable contamination. Although a tip<br>
protector is provided to be sleeved on the syringe after<br>
use to ensure that the needle is covered, the user is exposed<br>
to the risk of being pricked by the needle when sleeving<br>
the tip protector on the syringe. Therefore, there are<br>
available medical devices or syringes with a retractable<br>
needle that is retractable into a barrel or a plunger after<br>
the inj ection operation is completed, such as those disclosed<br>
in Indian Patent Application Nos. 594/KOL/03, 232/KOL/04,<br>
559/KOL/04, and 310/KOL/06 filed by the applicants. However,<br>
further improvements are desirable to prevent undesired<br>
withdrawal of the needle caused by inadvertent pressing of<br>
the plunger in a pre-use position, to ensure successful<br>
withdrawal of the needle, and to have a slenderized<br>
construction for small volume injection.<br>
One object of the present invention is to provide a<br>
disposable syringe which can be guarded in a preuse position<br>
to prevent undesired withdrawal of a needle caused by<br><br>
2<br>
inadvertent pressing of the plunger in the preuse position.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide<br>
a disposable syringe which can ensure successful withdrawal<br>
of a needle.<br>
Still another object of the present invention is to<br>
provide a disposable syringe which has a slenderized<br>
construction for small volume injection.<br>
According to this invention, the disposable syringe<br>
includes abarrel, a needle assembly, aplunger, andaspacer.<br>
The barrel has front and rear open barrel ends opposite to<br>
each other along an axis, and a surrounding barrel wall which<br>
defines a passage. A pair of lugs extend radially from the<br>
surrounding barrel wall and adjacent to the rear open barrel<br>
end. A tubular catch extends from the lugs along the axis<br>
and away from the surrounding barrel wall to terminate at<br>
a peripheral edge, and has outer and inner surrounding<br>
surfaces . The inner surrounding surface defines an insertion<br>
hole. The needle assembly includes a needle cannula and a<br>
needle seat securing the needle cannula. The needle seat<br>
is movable in the passage between a position of use, where<br>
a tip end of the needle cannula extends outwardly of the<br>
front open barrel end, and a disposal position, where the<br>
tip end of the needle cannula is retracted into the passage.<br>
The plunger has a front open plunger end, a rear open plunger<br>
end which extends outwardly of the rear open barrel end,<br>
and an intermediate surrounding wall which defines an<br>
accommodation chamber, and which has a rear segment proximate<br><br>
3<br>
to the rear open plunger end. The plunger is movable in the<br>
passage between the position of use, and a retraction<br>
initiating position, where the front open plunger end is<br>
coupled with the needle seat for withdrawal of the needle<br>
seat together with the needle cannula into the accommodation<br>
chamber . An endcap has an endwall extending radially to cover<br>
the rear open plunger end, and a ring wall extending from<br>
a periphery of the endwall to surround the rear segment and<br>
to terminate at a rim that confronts the lugs. The ring wall<br>
is fittable to the inner surrounding surface so as to permit<br>
the endcap to be retained in the insertion hole once the<br>
needle seat is placed in the disposal position. The spacer<br>
has front and rear abutment surfaces which detachably and<br>
respectively abut against the peripheral edge and the rim<br>
in a preuse position to thereby guard the plunger against<br>
movement towards the retraction initiating position.<br>

Before the present invention is described in greater<br>
detail, it should be noted that same reference numerals have<br>
been used to denote like elements throughout the<br>
specification.<br>
Referring to Figs. 1 to 3, the first preferred embodiment<br>
of a disposable syringe according to the present invention<br>
is shown to comprise a barrel 1, a needle assembly 2, a plunger<br>
3, and a spacer 4.<br><br>
6<br>
The barrel 1 has front and rear open barrel ends 132,131<br>
opposite to each other along an axis, and a surrounding barrel<br>
wall 13 which interconnects the front and rear open barrel<br>
ends 132,131, and which defines a passage 11. The surrounding<br>
barrel wall 13 has small-diameter and large-diameter wall<br>
portions (13a, 13b) which are disposed proximate to the front<br>
and rear open barrel ends 132,131, respectively, to divide<br>
the passage 11 into small and large passage segments<br>
(11a, 11b) . The small-diameter wall portion (13a) has a flange<br>
136 confronting rearwardly, and a plurality of retaining<br>
ribs 137 disposed adjacent to the large-diameter wall portion<br>
(13b) .<br>
A pair of lugs 133 extend radially from the large-diameter<br>
wall portion (13b) and are disposed adjacent to the rear<br>
open barrel end 131. A tubular catch 134 extends from the<br>
lugs 133 along the axis and away from the surrounding barrel<br>
wall 13 to terminate at a peripheral edge 139. The tubular<br>
catch 134 has outer and inner surrounding surfaces 1341,1342<br>
opposite to each other radially. The inner surrounding<br>
surface 1342 defines an insertion hole 1343. Preferably,<br>
the lugs 133 and the tubular catch 134 are integrally formed<br>
with the barrel 1.<br>
The needle assembly 2 includes a needle cannula 22 and<br>
a needle seat 21. The needle seat 21 is configured to secure<br>
the needle cannula 22, and is disposed to be movable in the<br>
passage 11 between a position of use, as shown in Fig. 1,<br>
where a tip end 221 of the needle cannula 22 extends outwardly<br><br>
7<br>
of the front open barrel end 132, and a disposal position,<br>
as shown in Fig. 6, where the tip end 221 of the needle cannula<br>
22 is retracted into the passage 11. The needle seat 21 has<br>
a rear seat portion 213 which is retained in the large passage<br>
segment (11b) by means of a grip member 14 so as to be placed<br>
in the position of use, and a front seat portion 214 which<br>
extends in the small passage segment (11a) and which is in<br>
frictional engagement with the small-diameter wall portion<br>
(13a) and the retaining ribs 137. The grip member 14 is in<br>
slidable air-tight engagement with the large-diameter wall<br>
portion (13b) and the rear seat portion 213, and is spaced<br>
apart from the small passage segment (lla) so as to be movable<br>
forwardly in the large passage segment (11b) . The front seat<br>
portion 214 has a front abutment 212 which is spaced apart<br>
from the flange 136 along the axis in the position of use<br>
so as to define a triggering space 135 therebetween.<br>
A coil spring 15 is disposed in the small passage segment<br>
(lla) to surround the needle cannula 22, and has front and<br>
rear biasing ends that abut against the front open barrel<br>
end 132 and the front seat portion 214, respectively, so<br>
as to be placed in a compressed state when the needle seat<br>
21 is in the position of use.<br>
The needle seat 21 further has an anchored portion 211<br>
which extends rearwardly from the rear seat portion 213 along<br>
the axis. In this embodiment, the anchored portion 211 is<br>
in the form of a plug. The plug has an axial passageway 2111<br>
and two transverse passageways 2112 which are fluidly<br><br>
8<br>
communicated with the passage 11 and the needle cannula 22,<br>
and which respectively extend along the axis and transverse<br>
to the axis.<br>
The plunger 3 has a front open plunger end 37 which is<br>
spaced apart from the needle seat 21, and a rear open plunger<br>
end 38 which is opposite to the front open plunger end 37<br>
along the axis, and which extends outwardly of the rear open<br>
barrel end 131 of the barrel 1. The plunger 3 further has<br>
an intermediate surrounding wall 32 which is interposed<br>
between the front and rear open plunger ends 37, 38 to define<br>
an accommodation chamber 31 therebetween, and which has a<br>
rear segment 321 proximate to the rear open plunger end 38,<br>
and a protrusion 35 proximate to the rear segment 321. A<br>
seal member 36 is retainingly sleeved on the front open<br>
plunger end 37, and is air-tightly and slidably engaged with<br>
an inner barrel surface 130 of the large-diameter wall<br>
portion (13b) . A coupling rod 34 is detachably inserted into<br>
the front open plunger end 37 to close the accommodation<br>
chamber 31. The coupling rod 34 has an anchoring area 341<br>
in the form of a socket that is configured to engage and<br>
mate with the plug of the needle seat 21, i.e. , the anchored<br>
portion 211.<br>
An endcap 33 has an endwall 331 which extends in a<br>
transverse direction relative to the axis to cover the rear<br>
open plunger end 38, and a ring wall 332 which extends from<br>
a periphery of the endwall 331 along the axis to surround<br>
the rear segment 321 and to terminate at a rim 333 that<br><br>
9<br>
confronts the lugs 133. The ring wall 332 is configured to<br>
be fittable to the inner surrounding surface 1342 of the<br>
tubular catch 134 so as to permit the endcap 33 to be retained<br>
in the insertion hole 1343 once the needle seat 21 is placed<br>
in the disposal position, as shown in Fig. 6.<br>
With reference to Figs. 3 and 4, the spacer 4 includes<br>
a spacer body 41 which has front and rear abutment surfaces<br>
411,412 opposite to each other along the axis, and inner<br>
and outer gripping walls 42,43 which extend from the front<br>
abutment surface 411 along the axis, and which are spaced<br>
apart from each other to define a retaining groove 40<br>
therebetween. The front and rear abutment surfaces 411,412<br>
detachably and respectively abut against the peripheral edge<br>
139 of the tubular catch 134 and the rim 333 of the endcap<br>
33 in a preuse position to thereby prevent the plunger 3<br>
from moving forwardly towards a retraction initiating<br>
position. The retaining groove 40 is configured to permit<br>
the tubular catch 134 to be snugly fitted therein in the<br>
pre-use position such that the inner and outer gripping walls<br>
42, 43 abut against the inner and outer surrounding surfaces<br>
1342,1341, respectively.<br>
The spacer 4 further has a ridge 44 which is disposed<br>
on the outer gripping wall 43 and distal from the inner<br>
gripping wall 42, and which extends along the axis to the<br>
spacer body 41 for easy manipulation.<br>
Referring to Figs. 1, 3 and 4, before an injection<br>
operation, the user can press the plunger 3 forwards to<br><br>
10<br>
substantially eliminate adhesion between the plunger 3 and<br>
the barrel 1 or to draw medicine liquid. As the front and<br>
rear abutment surfaces 411,412 respectively abut against<br>
the peripheral edge 13 9 and the rim 333, the front open plunger<br>
end 37 can be kept away from the retraction initiating<br>
position so as to prevent undesired withdrawal of the needle<br>
cannula 22 caused by inadvertent pressing of the plunger<br>
3, thereby ensuring the effectiveness of the disposable<br>
syringe.<br>
Referring to Figs. 5 and 6, during an injection operation,<br>
the user first removes the spacer 4 by pressing the ridge<br>
4 4 with his/her finger. The plunger 3 is then pressed forwards<br>
until the seal member 36 abuts against the grip member 14,<br>
thereby completing the injection and placing the plunger<br>
3 in the retraction initiating position. At this time, the<br>
anchoring area 341 of the coupling rod 34 is matingly engaged<br>
with the anchored portion 211. Hence, liquid trapped in the<br>
anchoring area 341 and the large passage segment (11b) is<br>
permitted to enter the needle cannula 22 through the axial<br>
and transverse passageways 2111,2112. Moreover, the axial<br>
and transverse passageways 2111,2112 are closed by the<br>
anchoring area 341 when the anchored portion 211 is<br>
completely inserted into and is engaged with the anchoring<br>
area 341, thereby preventing splashing of the liquid from<br>
the needle cannula 22 during a subsequent disposal operation.<br>
When the plunger 3 is further pressed forwards to move<br>
the grip member 14 and the needle seat 21 forwardly, the<br><br>
11<br>
front abutment 212 of the needle seat 21 is moved into the<br>
triggering space 135 to abut against the flange 136. By means<br>
of the movement of the needle seat 21 and the grip member<br>
14, the friction and adhesion of the needle seat 21 upon<br>
the small-diameter wall portion (13a) and the friction and<br>
sticking of the grip member 14 upon the large-diameter wall<br>
portion (13b) can be diminished to facilitate subsequent<br>
withdrawal of the needle seat 21 and the needle cannula 22<br>
into the accommodation chamber 31. At the same time, the<br>
needle seat 21 is disengaged from the grip member 14, and<br>
the coupling rod 34 is forced to move rearwards to disengage<br>
from the front open plunger end 37 so as to allow the coil<br>
spring 15 to bias the needle seat 21, as well as the needle<br>
cannula 22, to the disposal position. Thus, successful and<br>
smooth withdrawal of the needle cannula 22 is ensured.<br>
It is noted that, after completion of needle retraction,<br>
the ring wall 332 of the endcap 33 is fitted to the inner<br>
surrounding surface 1342 of the tubular catch 134 so as to<br>
permit the endcap 33 to be retained in the insertion hole<br>
1343, thereby preventing further manipulation of the endcap<br>
33 for reuse. In addition, once the protrusion 35 abuts<br>
against the rear open barrel end 131, further forward<br>
movement of the plunger 3 is checked so as to prevent<br>
application of excess compression force to the grip member<br>
14, which may result in deformation of the grip member 14<br>
and may therefore hinder retraction of the needle seat 21.<br>
Referring to Fig. 7, alternatively, the anchored portion<br><br>
12<br>
211 and the anchoring area 341 are in the form of a socket<br>
and a plug, respectively, which can engage and mate with<br>
each other for withdrawal of the needle seat 21 together<br>
with the needle cannula 22 into the accommodation chamber<br>
31.<br>
Referring to Figs. 8 to 10, the second preferred<br>
embodiment of a disposable syringe according to this<br>
invention is similar to the first preferred embodiment in<br>
construction, except that the spacer 4 further includes head<br>
and leg portions 45,46 which are disposed forwardly of the<br>
front abutment surface 411 and rearwardly of the rear<br>
abutment surface 412, respectively, and which are offset<br>
from each other radially such that the head and leg portions<br>
45, 46 respectively serve as power and weight ends of a lever<br>
for acquiring a propensity to abut against the inner<br>
surrounding surface 1342 of the tubular catch 134 and the<br>
ring wall 332 of the endcap 33, respectively, so as to thereby<br>
help stabilize the spacer body 41 in the pre-use position.<br>
The head portion 45 is configured to extend angularly about<br>
the axis, such as having a semi-circular shape, and is formed<br>
with a friction surface such that firm engagement of the<br>
head portion 45 with the inner surrounding surface 1342 of<br>
the tubular catch 134 can be ensured by virtue of an increased<br>
frictional force generated therebetween.<br>
Referring to Figs. 11 to 13, the third preferred<br>
embodiment of a disposable syringe according to this<br>
invention is similar to the first preferred embodiment in<br><br>
13<br>
construction, except that the spacer body 41 of the spacer<br>
4 includes a mounting surface 413 which extends along the<br>
axis, and which confronts the intermediate surrounding wall<br>
32 of the plunger 3 radially. In addition, there is provided<br>
a mortise joint that includes the protrusion 35 which is<br>
in the form of a tenon 35 and which is disposed on the<br>
intermediate surrounding wall 32 of the plunger 3 adjacent<br>
to the rear segment 321, and a mortise 414 which is disposed<br>
in the mounting surface 413 for receiving the tenon 35<br>
fittingly so as to prevent the spacer 4 frommoving angularly<br>
about the axis in the preuse position.<br>
Referring to Figs. 14 and 15, the fourth preferred<br>
embodiment of a disposable syringe according to this<br>
invention is similar to the first preferred embodiment in<br>
construction, except that a flexible connecting strap 6 is<br>
further disposed to interconnect the tubular catch 134 and<br>
the spacer 4, and is configured such that the front and rear<br>
abutment surfaces 411,412 are permitted to be removed from<br>
the peripheral edge 139 of the tubular catch 134 and the<br>
rim 333 of the endcap 33. In this embodiment, the flexible<br>
connecting strap 6 is integrally formed with the spacer 4<br>
and is disposed adjacent to the front abutment surface 411<br>
to engage the peripheral edge 139 of the tubular catch 134.<br>
In addition, the spacer 4 further has a leg portion 46 which<br>
is disposed rearwardly of the rear abutment surface 412 to<br>
abut against the ring wall 332 of the endcap 33 so as to<br>
help stabilize the spacer body 41 in the pre-use position.<br><br>
14<br>
Referring to Figs. 16 and 17, the fifth preferred<br>
embodiment of a disposable syringe according to this<br>
invention is similar to the fourth preferred embodiment in<br>
construction, except that the spacer 4 further has a head<br>
portion 45 which is disposed forwardly of the front abutment<br>
surface 411 to abut against the inner surrounding surface<br>
1342 of the tubular catch 134.<br>
Referring to Figs. 18 and 19, the sixth preferred<br>
embodiment of a disposable syringe according to this<br>
invention is similar to the fourth preferred embodiment in<br>
construction, except that the flexible connecting strap 6<br>
is disposed to interconnect the leg portion 46 of the spacer<br>
4 and the periphery of the endwall 331 of the endcap 33.<br>
In addition, the spacer 4 further has a head portion 45 which<br>
is disposed forwardly of the front abutment surface 411 to<br>
abut against the inner surrounding surface 1342 of the<br>
tubular catch 134 so as to help stabilize the spacer body<br>
41 in the preuse position.<br>
In the aforesaid embodiments, a disposable syringe is<br>
provided for injection of medication of a general volume,<br>
such as 3 ml, 5 ml or more. In the seventh preferred embodiment<br>
of this invention, as shown in Fig. 20, the disposable syringe<br>
is used for injection of medication of a very small volume,<br>
such as 1 ml or 0.5 ml. In other words, the barrel 1, the<br>
needle assembly 2, the plunger 3, and the spacer 4 have a<br>
relatively small structure.<br>
In order to obtain a slenderized construction of a<br><br>
15<br>
disposable syringe of the present invention, the coupling<br>
rod 34 has a front coupling portion 342 which extends<br>
forwardly beyond the front open plunger end 37 and which<br>
has an anchoring area 341 in the form of a socket. The seal<br>
member 36 is retainingly sleeved on the front coupling<br>
portion 342, and is air-tightly and slidably engaged with<br>
the inner barrel surface 130 of the large-diameter wall<br>
portion (13b) .<br>
It is noted that, since the needle seat 21 is movably<br>
engaged with the grip member 14 and is largely disposed in<br>
the large passage segment (11b) of the barrel 1, and since<br>
the coil spring 15 of this invention is disposed to surround<br>
the needle cannula 22 with the rear biasing end abutting<br>
against the front seat portion 214 of the needle seat 21,<br>
the diameter of the coil spring 15 and the diameter of the<br>
needle seat 21 can be relatively small. Thus, the inner<br>
diameter of the barrel 1 for accommodating the plunger 3,<br>
which in turn accommodates the retracted needle seat 21,<br>
can be made comparatively small so as to slenderize the whole<br>
construction of the disposable syringe for convenient<br>
detailed calibration of small volumes, such as 0.5 ml and<br>
1m1. Inaddition, comparedwith the syringes of theprevious<br>
embodiments in which the seal member 36 is sleeved on the<br>
front open plunger end 37 of the plunger 3, the seal member<br>
36 of this embodiment is sleeved on the front coupling portion<br>
342 of the coupling rod 34, thereby maximizing the inner<br>
diameter of the front open plunger end 37 for facilitating<br><br>
16<br>
entry of the retracted needle seat 21 into the accommodation<br>
chamber 31 of the comparatively slender plunger 3.<br><br>
