BIOTINYLATED HEXADECASACCHARIDES , PREPARATION AND USE THEREOF<br>
The present invention relates to novel synthetic biotinylated hexadecasaccharid.es having the anticoagulant and antithrombotic pharmacological activities of heparin.<br>
Heparin catalyses, especially via antithrombin III (AT III), the inhibition of two enzymes that are involved in the blood clotting cascade, namely factor Xa and factor Ila (or thrombin). Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) preparations contain chains formed from 4 to 3 0 monosaccharides and have the property of acting more selectively on factor Xa than on thrombin.<br>
It is known that the inhibition of factor Xa requires binding of heparin to AT III via the antithrombin binding domain (Domain-A) and that the inhibition of factor IIa (thrombin) requires binding to AT III, via the Domain-A, and also to thrombin via a less well defined binding domain (Domain-T).<br>
Synthetic oligosaccharides corresponding to the Domain-A of heparin are known. They are described, for example, in patents EP 84999 and EP 529 715, the patent application published under the number WO 99/36428 and the publication Bioorg. Med. Chem. (1998), 6, pp. 1509-1516. These synthetic oligosaccharides have the property of selectively inhibiting, via AT III, the clotting factor Xa without having any activity on thrombin. They show antithrombotic activity in venous thrombosis.<br>
Synthetic oligosaccharides capable of inhibiting thrombin and factor Xa via activation of AT III have been described in the patent applications published under the numbers WO 98/03554 and WO 99/36443.<br>
These patent applications describe novel, biologically active sulfated and alkylated polysaccharide derivatives. They are in particular anticoagulant and antithrombotic. It has in particular<br><br>
- 2 -<br>
been shown that these sulfated and alkylated polysaccharides can be powerful antithrombotic and anticoagulant agents depending on the arrangement of the alkyl groups and sulfate groups borne by the carbohydrate backbone. More generally, it has been found that, by preparing polysaccharide sequences, it is possible to precisely modify the activities of GAG type to obtain highly active products presenting the anticoagulant and antithrombotic pharmacological properties of heparin. In comparison with heparin, they have the advantage of having a determined structure and of not reacting with platelet factor 4, the cause of the thrombocytopaenic effects of heparin.<br>
However, the use in human therapeutics of some of the products described in the patent applications published under the numbers WO 98/03554 and WO 99/3 6443 and in patent EP 52 9 715 can prove to be problematic, in particular if these products have a long half-life. In the field of the prevention or treatment of thrombosis with the above products, the fluidity of the blood has to be reestablished or maintained while at the same time preventing the onset of a haemorrhage.<br>
This is because it is well known that a haemorrhage can be triggered in a patient under treatment, for any accidental reason. It may also be necessary to intervene surgically in the case of a patient under antithrombotic treatment. Furthermore, during certain surgical procedures, anticoagulants may be used at a high dose so as to prevent the blood from clotting, and it is necessary to neutralize them at the end of the operation. It is therefore advantageous to have antithrombotic agents that can be neutralized in order to stop the anticoagulant activity at any time. However, the known synthetic oligosaccharides described above cannot easily be neutralized by the known antidotes for heparin or LMWHs, including protamine sulfate.<br><br>
- 3 -<br>
The present invention relates to novel synthetic biotinylated hexadecasaccharides similar in structure to the compounds described in the patent application published under the number WO 02/24754. The hexadecasaccharides of the invention, and also certain compounds described in document WO 02/24754, are covalently bonded to a biotin derivative (hexahydro-2-oxo-lH-thieno[3,4-d]imidazole-4-pentanoic acid) via a "spacer" - sequences of formula (T1) or (T2) as defined in the present patent application - and consequently have the advantage of being able to be rapidly neutralized by a specific antidote, in an emergency situation. This specific antidote is avidin ("The Merck Index", Twelfth edition, 1996, M.N. 920, pp. 151-152) or streptavidin, two tetrameric proteins with respective masses equal to approximately 66 000 and 60 000 Da, which have very high affinity for biotin.<br>
However, surprisingly, it appears that the length of the "spacer" linking the biotin derivative to the hexadecasaccharide chain, and also the position of the biotin on the saccharide unit are factors that influence the efficacy of the neutralization by a specific antidote, and especially, for example, by avidin. Thus, the hexadecasaccharide compounds according to the invention have a much higher capacity for neutralization by a specific antidote than those described in the patent application published under the number WO 02/24754, by virtue of a "spacer" of controlled size and the position of the biotin on the saccharide unit.<br>
One subject of the present invention is biotinylated hexadecasaccharides of general formula I:<br><br><br>
- 4 -<br>
in which:<br>
-	T represents a sequence T1 or T2 having the following<br>
formulae:<br><br>
-	Biot represents the group:<br><br>
-	R represents a (C1-C6)alkoxy radical, especially a<br>
methoxy radical, or an -0S03 radical,<br>
-	R1 represents a (C1-C6)alkoxy radical, especially a<br>
methoxy radical, or an -0S03 radical,<br>
-	R2 represents a (C1-C6) alkoxy radical or an -0S03-<br>
radical,<br>
-	R3 represents a (C1-C6)alkoxy radical, especially a<br>
methoxy radical, or an -0S03- radical, or alternatively<br>
R3 constitutes an -O-CH2- bridge, the -CH2- group being<br>
linked to the carbon atom bearing the carboxylic<br>
function on the same ring,<br>
-	Pe represents a saccharide sequence having the<br>
following formula:<br><br>
- 5 -<br><br>
and the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof.<br>
The polysaccharide parts consist of uncharged and/or partially charged and/or fully charged alkylated monosaccharide units. The charged or uncharged units may be dispersed along the entire length of the chain or, in contrast, they may be grouped in charged or uncharged saccharide domains.<br>
In the present description, it has been chosen to represent the 1C4 conformation for L-iduronic acid and the 4C1 conformation for D-glucuronic acid, but it is well known that, in general, the conformation in solution of monosaccharide units fluctuates.<br>
Thus, L-iduronic acid may be of 4C12S0 or 4C1 conformation.<br>
The invention includes hexadecasaccharides in their acid form or in the form of any of their pharmaceutically acceptable salts. In the acid form, the -COO- and -S03- functions are in -COOH and -SO3H form, respectively.<br>
The term "pharmaceutically acceptable salt of the polysaccharides of the invention" means a polysaccharide in which one or more of the COOH and/or -S03- functions are ionically bonded to a pharmaceutically acceptable cation. The salts that are preferred according to the invention are those whose cation is chosen from alkali metal cations and even more preferably those whose cation is Na+ or K+.<br>
The compounds of formula I above also comprise those in which one or more hydrogen or carbon atoms have been replaced with the radioactive isotope thereof, for example tritium or 14C. Such labelled compounds are useful in research, metabolism or<br><br>
- 6 -<br>
pharmacokinetic studies, in biochemical tests as ligands.<br>
In the context of the present invention, the following definitions apply:<br>
-	a (C1-C6)alkoxy radical: a radical -O-alkyl, the alkyl<br>
group being a linear or branched saturated aliphatic<br>
radical containing a chain of 1 to 6 carbon atoms.<br>
Examples of alkyl radicals that may be mentioned<br>
include methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyl,<br>
isobutyl and tert-butyl. Examples of (C±-C6)alkoxy<br>
radicals that may be mentioned include methoxy and<br>
ethoxy radicals,<br>
-	a "spacer" T: the sequences of formula Tx or T2 below:<br><br>
-	a biotinylated derivative:<br><br>
The biotin derivatives are commercially available ("Pierce" catalogue 1999-2000, pp. 62 to 81).<br>
According to one of its preferred aspects, the present invention relates to the biotinylated hexadecasaccharides of general formula I in which:<br>
-	R represents a methoxy radical, or an -OSO3- radical,<br>
-	R1 represents a methoxy radical,<br>
-	R2 represents an -OSO3- radical,<br>
-	R3 represents a methoxy radical.<br>

In its principle, the process for preparing the compounds according to the invention uses di- or oligosaccharide base synthons prepared as reported previously in the literature. Reference will be made especially to the patents or patent applications EP 300 099, EP 529 715, EP 621 282 and EP 649 854 and also to the documents from C. van Boeckel and M. Petitpu, Angew. Chew. Int. Ed. Engl. , (1993), 32,<br><br>
- 8 -<br>
pp. 1671-1690. These synthons are then coupled to one another so as to give a fully protected equivalent of a polysaccharide according to the invention. This protected equivalent is then converted into a compound according to the invention.<br>
One of the base synthons mentioned above contains a particular protected function allowing the subsequent introduction of biotin or of a biotin derivative, for example a latent amine function in the form of an azido group or protected in the form of N-phthalimido.<br>
In the coupling reactions mentioned above, a "donor" di- or oligosaccharide, activated on its anomeric carbon, reacts with an "acceptor" di- or oligosaccharide containing a free hydroxyl.<br>
The present invention relates to a process for preparing the compounds of formula I, characterized in that:<br>
in a first step, a fully protected equivalent of<br>
the desired hexadecasaccharide of formula I is<br>
obtained, containing a protected pentasaccharide<br>
precursor, especially bearing a suitably protected<br>
amine function for the subsequent introduction of<br>
biotin or of a biotin derivative, this protected<br>
pentasaccharide precursor itself being extended by<br>
a protected precursor of the polysaccharide domain<br>
Pe;<br>
in a second step, the negatively charged groups<br>
are introduced and/or demasked;<br>
in a third step, the amine function is deprotected<br>
and the biotin or the biotin derivative is then<br>
introduced.<br>
The pentasaccharide onto which will be grafted the biotin or the biotin derivative is synthesized according to the methods described in particular in the patent applications published under the numbers WO 98/03554 and WO 99/36443 and also in the literature (cited above).<br><br>
- 9 -<br>
The polysaccharide part that is the precursor of Pe is synthesized according to reactions that are well known to those skilled in the art, using the methods for the synthesis of oligosaccharides (G.J. Boons, Tetrahedron, (1996),52, pp. 1095-1121, WO 98/03554 and WO 99/36443) or an oligosaccharide when an oligosaccharide that is a glycoside bond donor is coupled with an oligosaccharide that is a glycoside bond acceptor to give another oligosaccharide equal in size to the sum of the sizes of the two reactive species. This sequence is repeated until the compound of formula I is obtained. The nature and profile of the charge of the desired final compound determine the nature of the chemical species used in various steps of the synthesis, according to the rules that are well known to those skilled in the art. Reference may be made, for example, to C. van Boeckel and M. Petitou, Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. , (1993), 32, pp. 1671-1690 or to H. Paulsen, "Advances in selective chemical syntheses of complex oligosaccharides", Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl., (1982), 21, pp. 155-173.<br>
The compounds of the invention are obtained from the fully protected polysaccharide precursors thereof by using the following sequence of reactions:<br>
-	the alcohol functions that are to be converted into<br>
0-sulfo groups and the carboxylic acids are deprotected<br>
by removal of the protecting groups used during the<br>
preparation of the backbone, and then<br>
-	the sulfo groups are introduced next,<br>
-	the amine function that allows the introduction of<br>
biotin or the biotin derivative is deprotected,<br>
-	the biotin derivative is introduced via a standard<br>
amino/acid coupling reaction.<br>
The compounds of the invention may naturally be prepared by using various strategies known to those skilled in the art of oligosaccharide synthesis.<br>
The process described above is the preferred process of the invention. However, the compounds of<br><br>
- 10 -<br>
formula I may be prepared via other well-known methods of sugar chemistry described, for example, in "Monosaccharides, Their chemistry and their roles in natural products", P.M. Collins and R.J. Ferrier, J. Wiley § Sons, (19 95) and in G.J. Boons, Tetrahedron, (1996), 52, pp. 1095-1121.<br>
The pentasaccharides Pe may thus be obtained from disaccharide synthons as described in the publication by C. van Boeckel and M. Petitou, Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. , (1993), 32., pp. 1671-1690.<br>
The protecting groups used in the process for preparing the compounds of formula I are those commonly used in sugar chemistry, for example in "Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis", (1981), T.W. Greene, John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York.<br>
The protecting groups are advantageously chosen, for example, from acetyl, halomethyl, benzoyl, levulinyl, benzyl, substituted benzyl, optionally substituted trityl, tetrahydropyranyl, allyl, pentenyl, tert-butyldimethylsilyl (tBDMS) and trimethylsilylethyl groups.<br>
The activating groups are those conventionally used in sugar chemistry according to, for example, G.J. Boons, Tetrahedron, (1996) , 52, pp. 1095-1121. These activating groups are chosen, for example, from imidates, thioglycosides, pentenylglycosides, xanthates, phosphites and halides.<br>
As regards both the way in which the biotin derivative is linked to the oligosacchari.de and the nature of the biotin derivative, the chemical literature offers other possibilities that can possibly be used by means of sets of protecting groups that are well known to those skilled in the art. Use will preferably be made of an amine function, or a thiol function, or a carboxylic acid function or alternatively an aldehyde function, which will be reacted with a biotin derivative comprising a reactive group of the activated ester, maleimide, iodoacetyl or<br><br>
- 11 -<br>
primary amine type, the reaction taking place according to the conditions described in the literature (Savage et al., "Avidin-Biotin Chemistry: A Handbook"; (1992), Pierce Chemical Company).<br>
The process described above makes it possible to obtain the compounds of the invention in the form of salts. To obtain the corresponding acids, the compounds of the invention, in the form of salts, are placed in contact with a cation-exchange resin in acid form.<br>
The compounds of the invention in acid form may then be neutralized with a base to obtain the desired salt. Any mineral or organic base that gives pharmaceutically acceptable salts with the compounds of formula I may be used for the preparation of the salts of the compounds of formula I. Sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, calcium hydroxide or magnesium hydroxide is preferably used as base. The sodium and calcium salts of the compounds of formula I are the preferred salts.<br>
The compounds according to the invention underwent biochemical and pharmacological studies. 1. Measurement of the anti-factor IIa activity and of the anti-factor Xa activity<br>
The circulating activity of the compounds according to the invention may be measured by means of their anti-factor IIa activity and the anti-factor Xa activity as described by Herbert et al. , Thromb Haemost., (2001), 85 (5) , pp. 852-60. The compounds according to the invention are administered intravenously (IV) or subcutaneously (SC) to rats. An IV injection of avidin results in a large decrease in the circulating concentration of compound according to the invention (greater than 70%) .<br>
For example, the circulating concentration of the compound according to Example 1, after IV injection of 100 nmol/kg, is reduced by 88% (reduction measured via the anti-factor Xa activity) and 91% (reduction measured via the anti-factor IIa activity) 2 minutes<br><br>
- 12 -<br>
after the IV administration of avidin (10 mg/kg/625 nmol/kg).<br>
The circulating concentration of the compound according to Example 2, after IV injection of 100 nmol/kg, is reduced by 76% (reduction measured via the anti-factor Xa activity) and 89% (reduction measured via the anti-factor Ila activity) 5 minutes after the IV administration of avidin (10 mg/kg/625 nmol/kg).<br>
Equivalent inhibitions for the two activities are observed when the compounds according to Examples 1 and 2 are administered SC:<br>
2. Measurement of the global antithrombotic activity and neutralization with avidin<br>
The global antithrombotic activity of the compounds according to the invention and their neutralization was studied in a model of venous thrombosis consisting of an injection of tissue factor followed by stasis of rat vena cava, as described by Herbert et al. , Blood, (1998), SKL, pp. 4197-4205.<br>
a)	Measurement of the global antithrombotic<br>
activity<br>
The compounds of the present invention are powerful thrombosis inhibitors (IC50 values of less than 50 nM).<br>
For example, Examples 1 and 2 show IC50 values in this model of 3 and 9.9 nM, respectively, after their IV administration.<br>
For example, inhibition of the weight of the thrombus due to the compound according to Example 1 (at a concentration of 3 0 nmol/kg) is brought back to the control level by an IV injection of 3 mg/kg/208 nmol/kg of avidin.<br>
b)	Neutralization with avidin: bleeding test in<br>
rats<br>
The effect of compounds according to the invention was evaluated in the bleeding test in rats (Herbert et al. , Blood, (1998), 91, pp. 4197-4205).<br><br>
- 13 -<br>
These compounds show high anticoagulant activity and thus increase the bleeding time in the animal models. Avidin neutralizes the effect of the compounds according to the invention on bleeding.<br>
For example, the bleeding time induced in rats by 30 nmol/kg of the compound according to Example 1 is brought back to the control level by an IV administration of avidin (3 mg/kg; 208 nmol/kg).<br>
For example, the bleeding time induced in rats by 100 nmol/kg of the compound according to Example 2 is brought back to the control level by an IV administration of avidin (10 mg/kg; 625 nmol/kg).<br>
Thus, a subject of the present invention is also a process using avidin or streptavidin, characterized in that it allows the polysaccharides according to the invention to be neutralized. Avidin or streptavidin may be used for the preparation of medicaments for neutralizing the polysaccharides according to the present invention.<br>
By virtue of their biochemical and pharmaceutical activity, the oligosaccharides of the present invention constitute highly advantageous medicaments. Their toxicity is entirely compatible with this use. They are also very stable and are thus particularly suitable for constituting the active principle of pharmaceutical specialties.<br>
They can be used in various pathologies consecutive to a modification in the homeostasis of the clotting system appearing in particular during disorders of the cardiovascular and cerebrovascular system, for instance thromboembolic disorders associated with atherosclerosis and diabetes, such as unstable angina, apoplexy, post-angioplasty restenosis, endarterectomy or the insertion of endovascular prostheses; or thromboembolic disorders associated with post-thrombolysis rethrombosis, infarction, dementia of ischaemic origin, peripheral arterial diseases, blood dialysis, auricular fibrillations, or alternatively<br><br>
- 14 -<br>
during the use of vascular prostheses for aorto-coronary bypasses. These products may moreover be used for the treatment or prevention of thromboembolic pathologies of venous origin, such as pulmonary embolisms. They may be used for preventing or treating the thrombotic complications observed, for example, following surgical operations, the growth of tumours or disruption of clotting, induced by bacterial, viral or enzymatic activators. In the case of their use during the insertion of prostheses, the compounds of the present invention can cover prostheses and thus make them haemocompatible.
