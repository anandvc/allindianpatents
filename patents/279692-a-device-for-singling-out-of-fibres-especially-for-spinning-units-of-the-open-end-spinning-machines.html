The device for singling-out of fibres, especially for spinning units of the open-end spinning machines<br>
Technical field<br>
The device for singling-out of fibres especially for the spinning units of the open-end spinning machines comprising the opening roller arranged in the cavity of a body of singling-out device, while between the surface of perimeter of the opening roller and the inner surface of the cavity of the body there is performed a feeding channel of singled-out fibres into which between the feeding channel of the fibre sliver delivery device and the exhaust channel of impurities there opens an auxiliary inlet channel of compressed air connectable to the source of compressed air<br>
Background art<br>
The initial process of processing the fibre sliver in the singling-out device of the spinning unit represents the main source of impurities that are brought into the spinning unit of the open-end spinning machines.<br>
Once the spinning on a certain spinning unit is interrupted, feeding of fibre sliver into the singling-out device is stopped, while rotation of the opening roller goes on. At the same time the parts of fibres from the sliver end (so called beard) pressed by the standing delivery device are being combed and broken off up to a total combing of the beard while the fibres, their fragments and dust particles are accumulated in the spinning rotor.<br>
Impurities arising during the attending activities connected with interruption of spinning are being removed by a compressed air from a source positioned on the attending device, which is attached to this place in time of attending the operating unit of the spinning machine, or by means of a suitable instrument upon a manual attending. Before commencement of the spinning-in process itself, the spinning rotor is cleaned in this manner and the fibres combed of the sliver beard including the fragments and dust particles are brought outside the spinning rotor into the exhaust vacuum channel of the<br>
 <br>
spinning machine. At the same time the dust impurities from the accessible sections of the spinning unit are removed.<br>
DE OS 3436295 solves such unrepeated periodic cleaning before renewal of spinning by modification of exhaust channel and implementation of suction tube connected to the source of vacuum.<br>
According to the WO 86/01235 into the feeding channel of singling-out device behind the inlet channel bringing fibres into the spinning rotor there is positioned an auxiliary exhaust channel connectable to the source of vacuum in time of delivery of fibre sliver, through which the fibres are being exhausted.<br>
According to the CZ 280036 a stream of compressed air acts upon the surface of the opening roller before the spinning rotor is started. The direction of this stream is the same as the direction of rotation of the opening roller while the mouth of blowing out openings, through which the compressed air enters the fibre feeding channel, lies between the place of fibre sliver delivery to the opening roller and the mouth of the feeding channel of singled out fibres into the spinning rotor.<br>
PV 2004-15051 positions into openings, through which the auxiliary inlet channel of compressed air leads into the fibre feeding channel the insertion made of material penetrable for air, thus preventing clogging of these openings during singling-out process of fibres<br>
Clogging and pollution of inner space of singling-out device, especially of openings for blowing out of fibres before the spinning-in process itself nevertheless occur continuously during the whole period of operation of the spinning machine when into the blowing out openings the compressed air is not being brought and when the dust and the fibre fragments deposit gradually in the cross-section of blowing out openings and in the auxiliary inlet channel of compressed air. After a certain period of operation of operating unit this causes clogging of blowing out openings and considerable worsening in quality of piecing and decreasing in efficiency of spinning-in process. After then a complete cleaning of spinning unit is necessary, especially of blowing out openings e.g. through some of above mentioned methods.<br>
The intention of the technical solution is to remove or considerably decrease the shortcomings of the present state of the art.<br>
 <br>
The principle of invention<br>
The principle of the device for singling out of fibres according to the technical solution, especially for spinning units of the open-end spinning machines consists in that the auxiliary inlet channel of compressed air is connected with ambient atmosphere through the suction channel comprising a one-way suction valve.<br>
The substantial feature of me technical solution is that the suction oneway valve contains the locking element equipped with a spring, the seat lockable by means of a locking element and the stop of locking element, when the pre-stressed spring by one ot its end is leaned against a section of the body of singling-out device and by its second end it is leaned against a section of locking element being reversed from the stop, and between the stop of the locking element and after it continuing suction channel there is performed constantly opened suction cross-section<br>
In another advantageous embodiment the one-way valve comprises the locking element formed by a flat spring, which by its one end is attached to the body of singling-out device, while its second end is deflected from the inlet opening of the suction channel and it may be tilted over this inlet opening as a result of increased pressure :n an auxiliary air inlet channel, while in the tilted over position the flat spring overlaps the iniet opening of the suction channel.<br>
The advantage of the proposed technical solution is a self-acting suction of an air from an ambient atmosphere by acting of vacuum in chamber of the opening roller in the time of operation of ine operating unit which considerably reduces possibility of sedimentation of impurities in blowing out openings of an auxiliary air inlet channel during spinning or singling out of fibres while during acting of compressed air from the temporarily connected source of pressure the suction opening closes automatically, which prevents the losses of compressed air and undesired blowing out of compressed air into vicinity of the operating unit.<br>
 <br>
Description of the drawing<br>
Embodiment according io the technical solution is schematically represented in the drawing where the figure 1 shows the cross-section of the singling-out device of the open-eno spinning machine according to the first alternative of the proposed technical solution with a one-way suction valve comprising a ball loaded by a spring and the figure 2 represents a detail of another advantageous alternative of one-way suction valve, whose flat spring at the same time forms a locking means.<br>
Examples of embodiment<br>
The open-end spinning machine comprises a quantity of operating units arranged in one or more rows, each operating unit forms an independent assembly, which produces yarn of tne fibre sliver and winds it up onto a final bobbin. The production section itself of tho operating unit is formed by the not represented spinning unit, wnicn contains tne singiing-out device 1_ of delivered fibres and to it assigned spinning rotor 2.<br>
In the body 3 of singling-out device \ in a known manner there is rotatably mounted the opening roller 4, whose cylindric surface is provided with a working coating 41 formed for example by teeth or needles. Around the working coating 41 of the opening roller $ in the body 3 of singling-out device there is performed the reeding channel 31 of fibres In the body 3 of singling-out device 1 there is further performed the miet channel 32 for bringing the sliver 5 of fibres from the spinning container 51, and the feeding channel 33, through which the singled out fibres are delivered into the spinning rotor 2.<br>
To the opening roller 4 there is assigned a known delivery device 6, which comprises the feea roller £1, rotatably mounted in the body 3 of singling-out device 1, a condenser K2. in a swinging way mounted in the body 3 of the singling-out device 1.<br>
In the body 3 of the singling-out device 1 there is further in a known way performed the channel 34 for exhaust d impurities from the feeding channel 31_ of fibres being delivered ioeether with ; res by means of the working coating 41 of the opening roller 4   -

The locking element 91 in a standstill status by acting of a force of the spring 92 is leaning against the stop S3. The stop 93 is positioned so that the suction cross-section 95, remains constantly opened so that the suction channel   37 is a straigni-inrouan one<br>
In the embodiment representee in ;e Fig. 2 the suction one-way valve 9 comprises a shapeo fiat spring   96. 1 ho shaped flat spring   96 is by its end<br>
961	attached to the body 3 of singling O,L device so that its second free end<br>
962	overlaps the surface of nisi opening 371 of suction channel 37. The free end 962 of a flat spring M before [he imet opening 371_ is bent and the inlet opening 371. is in the not loaded status c the spring 96 opened. In exemplary embodiment the flat spring 98 is made of a strip of a spring loaded steel sheet. In other advantageous embodiments It is made of a strip of plastic or a technical rubber.
