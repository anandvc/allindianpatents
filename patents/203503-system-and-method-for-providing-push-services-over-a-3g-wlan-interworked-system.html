				<td>FIELD OF TECHNOLOGY<br>
The present invention relates to the area of wireless networking. More particularly, this invention relates to a system that allows a content provider to push content to a user over a wireless network. Specifically, the invention provides a system and method for a content provider to push contents to a user over a heterogeneous wireless network such as an integrated 3G-WLAN network.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART<br>
The 3GPP (http://www.3QPP.org) specifications TR 23.976 and TR 23.875 provide system description for allowing a content provider to push contents (also called push data) over a 3G (or GPRS) wireless network. Here the push initiator pushes the contents either on internet or on push function (also referred to as Push Proxy in the literature) on PLMN. Further the contents are pushed from push function of PLMN to the recipient via the delivery network, which is a wireless network that can support the transfer of contents using CS or PS or IMS network specific mechanisms. This mechanism has been illustrated in the Figure 1 and 2. The following steps are involved in the data processing:<br>
1.	The Push Initiator pushes the push contents (using user identity (user-ID) for a specific user) to the Push Proxy (also called push function) using some mechanism. The example of the mechanism may be Push Access Protocol (PAP) as specified by the WAP forum.<br>
2.	The Push Proxy resides in the delivery network which may be 3G or GPRS. Push Proxy maintains the user subscription related information.<br>
3.	The Push Proxy, using the address resolver functionality, obtains IMSI or MS-ISDN from the user-ID.<br>
4.	The desired user is a 3G user terminal or GPRS user.<br>
5.	The delivery network maintains all the information related to user (such as user availability).<br><br>
6.       The Push Proxy pushes the content using some Over the Air (OTA) mechanism/protocol in the delivery network to the intended user.<br>
LIMITATIONS<br>
Currently no known method exists by which a content provider (also referred as Push Service Provider) may push contents to a WLAN user (UE in WLAN coverage area), which is interconnected to a 3G like heterogeneous network. In addition, the technique for pushing the content depends upon the state of the push recipient (UE). In a 3G network (also referred as macro network in the literature), the UE state may be managed from the network side, for example, if the UE is attached to the network, mechanisms have been defined to initiate a session from the network side. However, there are no such network initiated mechanisms defined for the WLAN access network which can manage the user (UE) state. Therefore, in a 3G-WLAN integrated network, the mechanisms for pushing the content must address the issues related to dependency on the UE state.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
The primary object of the invention is to provide a system and method for supporting push service over a 3G-WLAN interworked system.<br>
It is another object of the invention to provide mechanisms to Push Proxy to find out the status (such as attach, already initiated tunnel between UE and PDG etc.) of the user (push recipient).<br>
It is another object of the invention to provide mechanisms by which the Push Proxy can transfer the push content to the user via the tunnel between UE and PDG by establishing a transport connection from Push Proxy to the push recipient.<br>
It is another object of the invention to provide mechanisms by which the Push<br><br>
Proxy can ask the UE to initiate a tunnel establishment for transferring the push content.<br>
It is another object of the invention to provide a mechanism by which the Push Proxy can be informed about user's presence in the network (if the user is not yet in the attach status).<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a system that allows a content provider to push content to a user over a wireless network. Specifically, the invention provides a system and method for a content provider to push contents to a user over a heterogeneous wireless network such as an integrated 3G-WLAN network, and such method is independent of the state of the recipient (UE). The present invention covers both the scenarios i.e. when the recipient (UE) is in non-roaming or roaming mode.<br>
The system of the present invention comprises a content provider (that provides the push content), a Push Proxy (which may be located in a 3G wireless system), and the desired user who is in the WLAN coverage area, the WLAN is interconnected to the 3G system. The user which is in WLAN coverage area must have the capability to access the 3G services via the interworked 3G-WLAN system.<br>
The method of invention comprises of mechanisms for identifying the user, finding out whether the user already has the required connection established, in case the user does not have an established connection then initiating the connection establishment from the network side, and pushing contents over the established connection.<br>
Accordingly the present invention comprises a system to provide a push content service to a WLAN user (UE in WLAN coverage area) interconnected to a 3G-<br><br>
WLAN interworked system comprising a content provider that provides the push content, Push initiator, a Push Proxy which may be located in a 3G wireless system, and the desired user which is in the WLAN coverage area where the WLAN is interconnected to the 3G system.<br>
Accordingly this invention further comprises a method for providing a push content service to a WLAN user (UE in WLAN coverage area) interconnected to a 3G-WLAN interworked system wherein the Push Service Provider comprising the content provider and the Push initiator sends the push contents destined to a particular user with a user ID within the delivery network to the Push Proxy. The delivery network is the network through which the push data is delivered to the UE. In this case it is the 3G operator network which provides the 3G-WLAN interworking subscription to the user. The Push Proxy, using an Address Resolver functionality provided obtains the IMSI or MS-ISDN from the user ID as per user's subscription information. The Push Proxy contacts the HSS, using the information (IMSI/MS-ISDN, QoS, W-APN, Push Proxy IP address) in the delivery network to obtain the information about the UE;, the AAA server, on request from Push Proxy, asks the UE to initiate a communication session to the Push Proxy.<br>
Using the tunnel management functionality and the information in AVP (Diameter protocol), the UE initiates the connection session to Push Proxy. The Push Proxy then pushes the contents to the UE over the connection session.<br>
Accordingly the present invention further comprises a method for providing a push content service to a WLAN user interconnected to a 3G-WLAN interworked system wherein tunneling is made between the UE (WLAN user on 3G network) and PDG by the AAA server providing mechanism to ask UE to initiate connection till PDG and providing PDG with related information about the user.<br><br>
The other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will be apparent from ensuing the detailed description of the invention taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The preferred embodiments of the present invention will now be explained with reference to the accompanying drawings. It should be understood however that the disclosed embodiments are merely exemplary of the invention, which may be embodied in various forms. The following description and drawings are not to be construed as limiting the invention and numerous specific details are described to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention, as the basis for the claims and as a basis for teaching one skilled in the art how to make and/or use the invention. However in certain instances, well-known or conventional details are not described in order not to unnecessarily obscure the present invention in detail.<br>
The present invention comprises a system and method considering the UE to be WLAN user (UE in WLAN coverage area) where the contents are pushed using push initiator through push proxy server or PLMN. The UE is on the heterogeneous network of 3G-WLAN system. The delivery network comprises of the interworked 3G-WLAN system. The push service provider uses the Push Proxy (residing within the delivery network) to push the contents to the desired push recipient. The mechanism used for pushing the content is independent of the state of the push recipient (UE).<br>
The UE may be a roaming or a non-roaming user. In the non-roaming case, the PDG is in the 3G network to which the user is subscribed. The AAA server can directly contact the UE. However in the roaming case, the AAA server needs to relay the information to AAA proxy for contacting the UE. This is because the UE can be contacted only through the Visited PLMN.<br>
The present method involves:<br>
1. identifying the user, (desired user) who is assumed to have subscribed for<br><br>
the said push service and all the subscription related information may be available at Push proxy;<br>
2.	finding out whether the user already has the required connection established, The same is provided to the push proxy by the AAA server;<br>
3.	in case the user does not have an established connection then initiating the connection establishment from the network side where the Push proxy request the AAA-Server to send a message towards the UE requesting for Connection ( Tunnel) establishment.; and<br>
4.	pushing contents to UE over the established connection once the UE is attached to the 3G network.<br>
5.	in case the user is not yet attached to the network itself, then a presence notification request is given to the HSS of the User by the Push Function, so that HSS can intimate the Push Proxy whenever UE gets attached to the interworking system.<br>
STRUCTURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
The content provider sends the desired push contents, using Push Initiator, to Push Proxy along with the user name (user identity). The content provider and Push Proxy keep all the subscription information for UE with respect to push services;<br>
1.     The functions implemented on the Push Proxy includes:<br>
Keeping  the  user  subscription  information  with   regard  to  Push<br>
subscription;<br>
Obtaining the mobile user identity such as IMSI (or MSISDN) from the<br>
user name (identity) as given by the content Provider. This may done<br>
using an address resolver which may contain mapping such as user<br>
name (identity) to IMSI or user name (identity) to MSISDN;<br>
obtaining UE related information (including the IP address of the<br><br>
desired user, whether the UE already has an established tunnel<br>
connection to PDG, whether UE is already attached to interworking<br>
WLAN-3G network but no established tunnel connection etc). For this,<br>
the Push Proxy sends a query to the HSS of the 3G network with the<br>
IMSI;<br>
Establishing a transport connection from Push Proxy to PDG- if the<br>
HSS informs the Push Proxy (in previous step) that the UE already<br>
has an established tunnel connection up to PDG;<br>

Initiating for establishing a connection from Push Proxy to UE, if HSS<br>
informs that the UE is attached but there is no established tunnel<br>
connection from UE to PDG;<br>
Keep the push content till Push Proxy pushes content over an<br>
established connection or for a pre-specified time.<br>
2.	The functions implemented on HSS include:<br>
Maintaining all the UE related information such as whether the UE is in attach state, whether the UE has an established connection Keeping the presence location notification flag when the UE is not attached.<br>
3.	The functions implemented on the AAA server include:<br>
Provide a mechanism to ask UE to initiate a connection till Push Proxy Provide PDG with all related information about the user to enable the traffic shaping<br>
To store AAA-proxy address of the V-PLMN during UE registration To support roaming by relaying the necessary information to the AAA Proxy of the Visited PLMN<br>
4.	The functions implemented on the PDG include:<br><br>
Having a tunnel till UE for data transfer from/to external entity Data transfer from Push Proxy to UE via it<br>
Enforce traffic shaping as per QoS information provided to it by the AAA server<br>
5. The functions implemented on the UE include:<br>
Having a tunnel till UE for data transfer from/to external entity Dereferencing the push content<br>
OPERATION OF THE INVENTION<br>
In order to bring out the detailed description of the invention the operation of the invention is described herein below:<br>
1.	The Push Service Provider (comprising the content provider and the Push initiator which has the functionality to initiate pushing the contents to a specific user) sends the push contents (destined to a particular user with a user ID within the delivery network) to the Push Proxy.<br>
2.	The said user (desired user) is assumed to have subscribed for the said push service and all the subscription related information may be available at the Push Proxy.<br>
3.	In the Step 1, the mechanism and the protocol by which the Push Service Provider (Specifically, the Push Initiator) sends the push content to the Push Proxy may include the Push Access Protocol (PAP) as provided by the WAP forum.<br>
4.	The Push Proxy, using an Address Resoiver functionality provided within which may include a database, obtains the IMSI or MS-ISDN from the user ID as per user's subscription information. A user is identifiable within<br><br>
a 3G network which constitutes the delivery network for the invention by the IMSI or MS-ISDN.<br>
5.	The Push Proxy contacts the HSS, using the information (IMSI/MS-ISDN,<br>
QoS, W-APN, Push Proxy IP address) in the delivery network to obtain<br>
the following information about the UE:<br>
-	whether the UE is already attached to the delivery network;<br>
-	the IP address of the User;<br>
-	whether the UE has already established a tunnel to the Packet Data Gateway (PDG) for effecting a data transfer through an external entity;<br>
-	if the user is not currently attached to the delivery network (3G network), then the Push Proxy may ask for presence notification (e.g., by setting some flag at the HSS) from the HSS for the desired user;<br>
-	in case of roaming user, Push Proxy obtains UE information from AAA-Server of H-PLMN (which obtains this from AAA-Proxy of V-PLMN).<br><br>
6.	If in step 5, the HSS informs the Push Proxy that the UE is currently NOT attached to the 3G network then the Push Proxy may ask for a notification from HSS whenever UE gets attached.<br>
7.	The step 6 may be carried out by setting some presence location information flag at the HSS on the request of the Push Proxy.<br>
8.	Whenever the UE is attached to the 3G network, the HSS informs the Push Proxy about the latest status of the UE, by using the flag as set up in step 7.<br>
9.	Push Proxy needs to keep the push contents with it till the time from step<br><br>
5 to step 25. It may be done by local caching policy at the Push Proxy.<br>
10.	Once the Push Proxy is informed by the HSS that the UE is in attached status, the steps from 12 to 21 may be carried out to push the contents to the user.<br>
11.	In the case of roaming, when the UE is moving form Home PLMN to the visited PLMN, the AAA server of the Home PLMN need to relay all the information (step 15) to the AAA proxy in the visited PLMN. All other steps (12 to 25) are now carried out by AAA server of home PLMN via the AAA proxy of visited PLMN.<br>
12.	If in Step 5, the HSS informs the Push Proxy that the UE is attached to the 3G network BUT the UE does not have a tunnel established to the PDG, then a mechanism is needed that will allow the push contents to be transferred to the desired user.<br>
13.	A first step for the said mechanism of step 12 involves the HSS conveying the information to the Push Proxy about the AAA server in the 3G network.<br>
14.	The Push Proxy contacts the said AAA server, the information about which is obtained in step 13, using a Diameter protocol. This message from the Push Proxy to the AAA server, which is communicated over a Diameter protocol, includes the IMSI / User ID of desired user, the IP address of the Push Proxy, W-APN information, a specific tunnel ID (given by Push Proxy), and the Quality of Service that may be required by the Push Proxy to push the contents to the desired user.<br>
15.	Using the information from step 14, AAA server asks the UE to initiates a communication session (e.g. tunnel, TCP/UDP transport connection) to the Push Proxy.<br><br>
16.	For carrying out step 15, AAA server sends the tunnel initiation request and required information, as detailed in step 14 and 15 above, to the WLAN Access point (AP) which is then required to pass the information to the UE.<br>
17.	The information from AAA server to the WLAN AP is carried using Diameter (by using optional setting such as Attribute, Value, and Parameter (AVP) fields for tunnel initiation). The WLAN AP obtains this AVP information from the Diameter related portions and sends it to the UE over the WLAN (802.11) protocol.<br>
18.	The AVP contains the information as given in step 14, such as the IMSI / User ID of desired user, the IP address of the Push Proxy, W-APN information, a specific tunnel ID (given by Push Proxy), and the Quality of Service that may be required by the Push Proxy to push the contents to the desired user. AVP also contains the application ID which the UE uses for establishing the connection.<br>
19.	The UE needs to have some tunnel management functionality. Using this tunnel management functionality and the information in AVP as in step 18, UE initiates the connection session (such as TCP or UDP) to Push Proxy.<br>
20.	The Push Proxy then pushes the contents to the UE over the connection session, which was established in step 19.<br>
21.	Once the contents are pushed by the Push Proxy, the connection (which was established in step 19) is terminated.<br>
22.	If the Push Proxy is informed by the HSS, in the step 5, that the UE is already attached to the delivery network AND that UE already has a tunnel established to PDG for data transfer, then using the user IP<br><br>
address (as informed by HSS in the step 5) the Push Proxy effects a data transfer of the push contents to the desired user via the tunnel between PDG and UE.<br>
23.	A session needs to be initiated between Push Proxy and the UE to effect a data transfer of the push contents. For this, the Push Proxy (source IP address) initiates a TCP connection (UDP may also be used) to the UE (having an IP address) with the destination based routing to UE (the destination address being the IP address of the UE) through PDG.<br>
24.	Using steps 22 and 23, the push contents are transferred to the UE via the already established tunnel between PDG and UE.<br>
25.	Once the push contents are delivered to the PDG by the Push Proxy, using the step 24, the TCP/UDP connection, between PDG and the Push Proxy is terminated.<br>
26.	The UE may dereference the push content (such as the type of content),<br>
upon receiving it using step 24, by looking into the appropriate headers of the<br>
push content.<br>
An illustrative Example for operation of the invention:<br>
An illustrative example for operating the invention is given here. We consider the roaming scenario where the user can contact the subscribed 3G operator only through Visited Mobile Network (V-PLMN) as shown in Figure 4. The message flows/sequence is illustrated in Figure 5. The below steps briefly explain the operation of the example:<br>
1. In a roaming scenario, AAA-Proxy IP address, which relays the registration signaling towards AAA-Server of H-PLMN, shall be saved in the AAA-Server. This would facilitate to reach UE, when a Tunnel Establishment request needs to be forwarded to the UE in the visited PLMN.<br><br>
2.	Push Initiator sends {User-ID, Push Content,..} to Push Proxy using some protocol such as PAP.<br>
3.	Push Proxy translates the User-ID to IMSI/MS-ISDN using Address Resolver (AR). Push Proxy requests HSS for WLAN UE attaches status using some specified interface between HSS and Push Proxy using a Diameter message. This typically contains {IMSI/MS-ISDN, Presence_ ^Notification^ Flagjieeded,..}.<br>
4.	HSS shall reply back to Push Proxy about the WLAN UE attach status message on the specified interface between HSS and Push Proxy with {IMSI/MS-ISDN,UE-IP-address (if any), PDG-IP-address(if any), AAA-Server address (if any), PresenceJvJotification_flag_accepted,..}<br>
5.	If WLAN UE is not attached, HSS shall notify to Push Proxy using Presence Notification Message over the specified interface, passing on {IMSI/MS-ISDN, AAA-Server address,. J. This step is not needed in case WLAN UE is already attached.<br>
6.	Push Proxy Sends a Tunnel Establishment Request (TER) with {IMSI/MS-ISDN, W-APN, Push Proxy IP address, reqd, Tunnel ID,..} to AAA-Server using a new interface with Diameter base protocol.<br>
7.	AAA-Server shall retrieve AAA-Proxy address to which WLAN - UE is currently attached to the V-PLMN, and shall forward the TER request.<br>
8.	TER is forwarded by AAA-Server to Access Point using the specified interface between the WLAN AP and the AAA-Server. In case of roaming user, the AAA-server relays all the information to AAA-Proxy, which is then sent to the WLAN AP.<br><br>
9.	TER is forwarded by AP to WLAN-UE using WLAN (802.11) protocol.<br>
10.	Tunnel is established by UE towards H-PLMN PDG using W-APN and QoS provided. WAG of V-PLMN would assist in forming a tunnel from V-PLMN towards H-PLMN PDG.<br>
11.	TCP Session is initiated by UE towards Push Proxy using the IP address provided. Steps from 5 to 10 are not needed in case HSS replies (in step 4) with UE and PDG IP addresses for an already existing tunnel. TCP Session is initiated by the Push Proxy in this case towards UE. In place of TCP, UDP may also be used.<br>
12.	Push Message content is delivered to UE on the TCP/UDP session established with the above procedure.<br>
13.	After Push content transfer, TCP/UDP session is terminated by Push Proxy and tunnel is released by UE, if tunnel is established only for transferring the Push content.<br>
It will also be obvious to those skilled in the art that other control methods and apparatuses can be derived from the combinations of the various methods and apparatuses of the present invention as taught by the description and the accompanying drawings and these shall also be considered within the scope of the present invention. Further, description of such combinations and variations is therefore omitted above. It should also be noted that the host for storing the applications include but not limited to a microchip, microprocessor, handheld communication device, computer, rendering device or a multi function device.<br>
Although the present invention has been fully described in connection with the preferred embodiments thereof with reference to the accompanying drawings, it is to be noted that various changes and modifications are possible and are apparent to those skilled in the art. Such changes and modifications are to be<br><br>
understood as included within the scope of the present invention as defined by the appended claims unless they depart therefrom.<br><br>

Push service: is the delivery of information (data/multimedia) from a network node to user equipment for the purpose of activating the UE, providing information from the network. The Push Service is initiated by a Push Initiator in order to transfer push data (e.g. data, multimedia content) from the Push Initiator to the Push Recipient without a previous user action.<br>
Push Data: data sent by the push initiator to the push recipient, of a format known to the receiver (push recipient), and not otherwise defined by the push service.<br>
Push function (Push Proxy): the function in the PLMN that receives the Push Data from the Push initiator. The push function is responsible for delivering the push data to the Push recipient. It is also referred as Push Proxy in the literature. Push initiator: the entity that originates push data and submits it to the push function for delivery to a Push recipient. A Push initiator may be e.g. an application providing value added services. Push recipient: the entity that receives the push data from the Push function<br><br>
and processes or uses it, for example the UE.<br>
Push User agent: is any software or device associated with a Push recipient<br>
that interprets Push Data to the user. This may include textual browsers, voice<br>
browsers, search engines, machine or device interface software, etc.<br>
QoS: Quality of Service<br>
User IP address: an IP address provided by the delivery network that can be<br>
used by an application server to access to a push services user. The address<br>
can be temporarily assigned to the user so that the network shares the address<br>
among multiple users.<br>
User-ID: an identity or name that can be used to deliver push content to a user<br>
in a delivery network. The format of user-ID is dependent on the protocol for the<br>
push services.<br>
User availability: the ability of a delivery network to provide push service to a<br>
subscribed user.<br>
User terminal: the end user equipment that receives push content, e.g., the<br>
Mobile Station (MS) or User Equipment (UE).<br>
V-PLMN: Visited Public Land Mobile Network. When the user is accessing the<br>
WLAN which is not directly connected to the subscribed network, it can be<br>
accessed through some other 3G Operator. The 3G operator directly connected<br>
to WLAN is called the V-PLMN for this user and the scenario is called roaming<br>
scenario.<br>
WAG: Wireless Access Gateway<br>
W-APN: WLAN APN<br>
WLAN AN: WLAN Access Network<br>
WLAN-3G user (UE): A user (UE) in WLAN coverage area, having dual mode<br>
stack (WLAN and 3G) and having the capability to interconnect to a 3G-WLAN<br>
interworking system<br><br><br><br>
WE CLAIM<br>
1.	A method for providing the push content services to a WLAN user<br>
interconnected to a 3G-WLAN interworked system wherein:<br>
(a)	the Push Service Provider comprising the content provider and the Push initiator sends the push contents destined to a particular user with a user ID within the delivery network to the Push Proxy;<br>
(b)	the Push Proxy, using an Address Resolver functionality provided, obtains the IMSI or MS-ISDN from the user ID as per user's subscription information;<br>
(c)	the Push Proxy contacts the HSS, using the information (IMSI/MS-ISDN, QoS, W-APN, Push Proxy IP address) in the delivery network to obtain the information about the UE;<br>
(d)	the AAA server, on request from Push Proxy, asks the UE to initiate a communication session to the Push Proxy;<br>
(e)	using the tunnel management functionality and the information in AVP (Diameter protocol), the UE initiates the connection session to Push Proxy; and<br>
(f)	the Push Proxy then pushes the contents to the UE over the connection session.<br><br>
2.	A method as claimed in claim 1, wherein the Push Service Provider pushes the push content to the desired WLAN user even through a delivery network that comprises of the interworked 3G systems.<br>
3.	A method as claimed in claim 1, wherein the Push Service Provider pushes the push content to the desired WLAN user via a Push Proxy that resides in the delivery network of 3G systems.<br>
4.	A method as claimed in claim 1, wherein the step of initiating and providing necessary  transport mechanism  for the  push  data  transfer,   having  a<br><br>
presence notification indicator is carried out, when the user is not currently effecting the push data transfer.<br>
5.	A method for providing a push content service to a WLAN user interconnected to a 3G-WLAN interworked system, wherein to push content tunneling is made between UE (WLAN user on 3G network) and the PDG by the AAA server providing mechanism to ask UE to initiate connection till PDG and providing PDG with related information about the user.<br>
6.	A method as claimed in claim 5, wherein tunneling is made between the UE and PDG for the roaming user implemented using proxy AAA server to have tunnel between UE and WAG (on V-PLMN), and establishing its connection to PDG (on H-PLMN) and then AAA server on (H-PLMN) provides PDG (on H-PLMN) with WAG (V-PLMN) related information to get PDG connected to Push Proxy.<br>
7.	A system to provide the push content services to a WLAN user interconnected to a 3G-WLAN interworked system comprising:<br><br>
(a)	a content provider that provides the push content;<br>
(b)	a Push initiator;<br>
(c)	a Push Proxy which may be located in a 3G wireless system; and<br>
(d)	the desired user which is in the WLAN coverage area where the WLAN is interconnected to the 3G system.<br><br>
8.	A system as claimed in claim 7, wherein the push content services is provided to WLAN user, where the user is in roaming mode.<br>
9.	A system as claimed in claim 7, wherein the push content services is provided to WLAN user, where the user is in non-roaming mode.<br>
10.	A system to provide the push content services to a WLAN user interconnected to a 3G-WLAN interworked system substantially as herein<br><br>
described particularly with reference to the drawings.<br>
11. A method for providing the push content services to a WLAN user interconnected to a 3G-WLAN interworked system substantially as herein described particularly with reference to the drawings.<br><br></td>
