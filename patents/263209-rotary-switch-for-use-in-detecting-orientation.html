				<td>Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a rotary switch.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Conventionally, there is known a rotary switch that<br>
includes a housing provided with a fixed contact point and a<br>
rotor having a movable contact point, the rotor rotatably<br>
attached to the housing for rotation in such a direction as<br>
to cause the movable contact point to make contact with or<br>
separate from the fixed contact point (see, e.g., Japanese<br>
Patent Laid-open Publication No. 2004-231094) .<br>
As shown in Fig. 9 by way of example, this kind of<br>
rotary switch 1 is attached to a coupling portion between a<br>
body frame B and a stand S in a two-wheeled vehicle and is<br>
used in detecting a standing state of the stand S. In other<br>
words, the rotary switch 1 keeps an engine from starting up<br>
when the stand S is in the standing state that the vehicle<br>
is parked, thereby preventing the vehicle from running while<br>
the stand S remains in the standing state.<br>
Specifically, the rotary switch 1 is provided with a<br>
housing 2 which includes a main body portion 21 for<br>
receiving a fixed contact point and a rotor (not shown) with<br><br>
a movable contact point, a wiring leading portion 22 from<br>
which electric cables C electrically connected respectively<br>
to the fixed contact point and the movable contact point is<br>
led to the outside, and a positioning portion 23 for<br>
interposing a positioning pin B1 protruding from the body<br>
frame B between itself and the wiring leading portion 22.<br>
The housing 2 is coupled to the body frame B in a state that<br>
the positioning pin Bl is interposed between the wiring<br>
leading portion 22 and the positioning portion 23.<br>
The rotor is connected to the stand S. If the stand S<br>
is rotated relative to the body frame B as indicated by an<br>
arrow A1, the rotor is also rotated relative to the housing<br>
2 together with the stand S. The movable contact point is<br>
contacted with or separated from the fixed contact point<br>
depending on whether or not the stand S is in the standing<br>
state.<br>
In the example shown in Fig. 9, the stand S is<br>
provided with a stud S1 protruding in the same direction as<br>
the protruding direction of the positioning pin Bl of the<br>
body frame B. The positioning pin Bl of the body frame B<br>
and the stud S1 of the stand S are interconnected by means<br>
of a connecting spring SP formed as a tension coil spring.<br>
The stand S is maintained, by a tensile force of the<br>
connecting spring SP, in one of the standing state when the<br>
vehicle is parked and a retreated state when the vehicle<br>
runs.<br><br>
In this kind of rotary switch, the rotor may include a<br>
synthetic resin-made rotor body connected to the stand for<br>
rotation relative to the housing together with rotation of<br>
the stand with respect to the body frame, a metal plate-made<br>
movable contact member having a movable contact point, and a<br>
contact pressure spring arranged between the rotor body and<br>
the movable contact member for biasing the movable contact<br>
member with respect to the rotor body in such a direction as<br>
to press the movable contact point against a fixed contact<br>
point. In other words, the contact pressure between the<br>
movable contact point and the fixed contact point is secured<br>
by use of the contact pressure spring.<br>
In the rotary switch, the movable contact member has<br>
at least one interlocking lug that protrudes in the same<br>
direction as an axis about which the rotor rotates relative<br>
to the housing. The rotor body is provided with an<br>
interlocking hole into which the interlocking lug is fitted.<br>
The movable contact member is interlocked with the rotor<br>
body by fitting the interlocking lug into the interlocking<br>
hole.<br>
Conventionally, since the interlocking lug is formed<br>
by, e.g., an extruding work, the protruding size of the<br>
interlocking lug is restricted by the ductility of a<br>
material of the movable contact member. Such an inability<br>
to increase the protruding size of the interlocking lug<br>
makes it impossible to increase the depth of the<br><br>
interlocking lug fitted into the interlocking hole.<br>
Therefore, even after the contact pressure spring and the<br>
movable contact member are assembled to the rotor body, the<br>
interlocking lug may be released from the interlocking hole<br>
by a biasing force of the contact pressure spring. Thus,<br>
the movable contact member is apt to be separated from the<br>
rotor body, consequently reducing the ease of assembly.<br>
In this regard, use of a material with high ductility<br>
as the movable contact member would make it possible to<br>
increase the protruding size of the interlocking lug to some<br>
extent. Since the material with high ductility shows a low<br>
wear resistance in most cases, however, use of such material<br>
leads to shortened lifespan.<br>
As an alternative construction, it would be possible<br>
to form the interlocking lug in the rotor body instead of<br>
forming it in the movable contact member, while the<br>
interlocking hole into which the interlocking lug is fitted<br>
is formed in the movable contact member. In this case, it<br>
is necessary for the interlocking lug to avoid physical<br>
interference with the housing or the fixed contact point.<br>
This makes it impossible to increase the protruding size of<br>
the interlocking lug.<br>
Further, in the case of the rotor made of a molded<br>
synthetic resin product in an effort to reduce the<br>
manufacturing cost thereof, if the rotor is fixed to the<br>
stand with a bolt fitted through the rotor, it is highly<br><br>
likely that the rotor is broken due to excessive tightening<br>
of the bolt.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
In view of the foregoing, the present invention<br>
provides a rotary switch capable of enhancing the ease of<br>
assembly and restraining breakage of a rotor which would<br>
otherwise be caused by the tightening of a bolt fitted<br>
through the rotor.<br>
In accordance with a first aspect of the present<br>
invention, there is provided a rotary switch for use in<br>
detecting the orientation of a stand with respect to a body<br>
frame of a two-wheeled vehicle, including: a housing<br>
provided with a fixed contact point and connected to the<br>
body frame; and a rotor for holding a movable contact point<br>
capable of making contact with and separating from the fixed<br>
contact point, the rotor rotatably attached to the housing,<br>
the rotor being rotatable relative to the housing in such a<br>
direction as to change over the contact and separation of<br>
the movable contact point and the fixed contact point as the<br>
stand is rotated relative to the body frame, the rotor<br>
having a bolt insertion hole through which a bolt is<br>
inserted, the rotor being attached to the stand by means of<br>
the bolt inserted through the bolt insertion hole.<br>
The rotor includes a metal-made sleeve constituting a<br><br>
circumferential surface of the bolt insertion hole and a<br>
rotor body formed of a synthetic resin for holding the<br>
sleeve in place.<br>
With such configuration, the sleeve helps to increase<br>
mechanical strength, thereby restraining breakage of parts<br>
which would be caused when tightening the bolt.<br>
It is preferable that the sleeve is made of steel<br>
plated with nickel.<br>
With such configuration, use of nickel with a<br>
relatively high wear resistance ensures that the plated<br>
layer is hardly peeled off, thus keeping the anti-rust<br>
effect intact.<br>
In addition, the rotary switch further includes a<br>
tubular protection body, interposed between an outer<br>
circumferential surface of the sleeve and the rotor body,<br>
for covering the outer circumferential surface of the sleeve,<br>
the protection body made of a synthetic resin that exhibits<br>
an alkali resistance higher than that of the synthetic resin<br>
forming the rotor body.<br>
With such configuration, the protection body protects<br>
the rotor body from degradation which would otherwise be<br>
caused by alkaline liquid containing ambient water and<br>
hydroxyl radicals, the hydroxyl radicals generated by the<br>
ions that are emitted when the metal constituting the sleeve<br>
is rusted.<br>
It is preferable that the sleeve is provided with an<br><br>
anti-rotation portion that makes contact with a surface of<br>
the rotor body opposite from a surface facing a head portion<br>
of the bolt.<br>
With such configuration, as compared to a case that<br>
the anti-rotation portion is absent, the sleeve is prevented<br>
from rotating relative to the rotor body by the frictional<br>
force acting between the anti-rotation portion and the rotor<br>
body.<br>
In accordance with a second aspect of the present<br>
invention, there is provided a rotary switch for use in<br>
detecting the orientation of a stand with respect to a body<br>
frame of a two-wheeled vehicle, including: a housing<br>
provided with a fixed contact point and connected to the<br>
body frame; and a rotor for holding a movable contact point<br>
capable of making contact with and separating from the fixed<br>
contact point, the rotor rotatably attached to the housing,<br>
the rotor being rotatable relative to the housing in such a<br>
direction as to change over the contact and separation of<br>
the movable contact point and the fixed contact point as the<br>
stand is rotated relative to the body frame.<br>
The rotor includes a rotor body made of a synthetic<br>
resin and connected to the stand for rotation relative to<br>
the housing together with rotation of the stand relative to<br>
the body frame, a movable contact member formed of a metal<br>
plate, which holds the movable contact point, and contact<br>
pressure springs interposed between the rotor body and the<br><br>
movable contact member for biasing the movable contact<br>
member away from the rotor body in such a direction as to<br>
press the movable contact point against the fixed contact<br>
point.<br>
The movable contact member may have at least one<br>
interlocking lug protruding in the same direction as a<br>
rotational axis about which the rotor is rotated relative to<br>
the housing, and the rotor body has at least one an<br>
interlocking hole into which the interlocking lug is fitted,<br>
so that the movable contact member is moved together with<br>
the rotor body by the interlocking lug fitted into the<br>
interlocking hole, the interlocking lug being formed by a<br>
bending work.<br>
With such configuration, the interlocking lugs are<br>
formed by the bending work, so that it is possible to<br>
increase the protruding size of the interlocking lugs, as<br>
compared to a case that the interlocking lugs are formed by<br>
an extruding work. Therefore, the interlocking lugs are<br>
hardly removed from the corresponding interlocking holes in<br>
the assembling process, which enhances the ease of assembly.<br>

Detailed Description of the Embodiments<br>
Hereinafter, the embodiments of the present invention<br>
will be described with reference to the accompanying<br>
drawings which form a part hereof.<br>
(First Embodiment)<br>
A first embodiment of the present invention will be<br>
described with reference to Figs. 1A to Fig. 3B.<br>
As shown in Figs. 1A and 1B and Fig. 2, a rotary<br>
switch 1 of the present embodiment includes a housing 2 and<br>
a rotor 3 rotatably supported on the housing 2. The housing<br>
2 has a fixed contact point 41 and the rotor 3 is provided<br>
with a movable contact point 42 that makes contact with or<br>
moves away from the fixed contact point 41 when the rotor 3<br>
is rotated relative to the housing 2. In the following<br>
description, the terms "upper" and "lower" are defined on<br>
the basis of Fig. 1B.<br>
The housing 2 is formed of, e.g., a synthetic resin<br>
molded product, and includes a cylindrical main body portion<br>
21 with a base wall, a wiring leading portion 22 and an<br>
positioning portion 23, the latter two of which are the same<br>
as those of the prior art example. The main body portion 21<br>
has a downwardly opened accommodating recess portion 20 in<br>
which the rotor 3 is received in part. Positioning<br><br>
protrusions 22a and 23a that protrude upwardly and face with<br>
each other are respectively formed on the upper surfaces of<br>
the wiring leading portion 22 and the positioning portion 23.<br>
At least one fixed contact point 41 and a counterpart<br>
connection terminal 51 are held in place on the inner bottom<br>
surface of the accommodating recess portion 20. The fixed<br>
contact point 41 is formed of a metal plate arranged<br>
horizontally. The fixed contact point 41 is of an arc shape<br>
whose center is aligned with the rotational axis about which<br>
the rotor 3 rotates relative to the housing 2. In case of<br>
employing two or more fixed contact points 41, they have<br>
common inner and outer diameters.<br>
The counterpart connection terminal 51 is formed of a<br>
metal plate arranged horizontally. The counterpart<br>
connection terminal 51 is of an annular shape whose center<br>
is aligned with the rotational axis about which the rotor 3<br>
rotates relative to the housing 2. The counterpart<br>
connection terminal 51 has an outer diameter smaller than<br>
the inner diameter of the fixed contact point 41.<br>
An electric cable C is led to the outside from the<br>
wiring leading portion 22 of the housing 2. The electric<br>
cable C has core wires (not shown) that correspond to the<br>
fixed contact point 41 and the counterpart connection<br>
terminal 51 in a one-to-one correspondence relationship.<br>
Each of the core wires is electrically connected to the<br>
corresponding one of the fixed contact point 41 and the<br><br>
counterpart connection terminal 51.<br>
The rotor 3 includes a movable contact member 33<br>
holding a movable contact point 42 in place, the movable<br>
contact member 33 being formed by punching and bending a<br>
metal plate; an inner rotor 31 received in the accommodating<br>
recess portion 20 and connected to the movable contact point<br>
42 through the movable contact member 33; and an outer rotor<br>
32 mechanically coupled to the inner rotor 31 and arranged<br>
inside and outside the accommodating recess portion 20. The<br>
inner rotor 31 and outer rotor 32 are made of synthetic<br>
resin, e.g., polybutylene terephthalate (PBT), and are<br>
combined together to constitute a rotor body recited in the<br>
claims.<br>
As shown in Figs. 3A and 3B, the inner rotor 31<br>
includes a generally flat ring-shaped main body portion 31a,<br>
a cylindrical shaft portion 31b protruding from the center<br>
region of the main body portion 31a in upward and downward<br>
directions so as to bring the upper and lower spaces of the<br>
main body portion 31a into communication with each other,<br>
and a cylindrical coupling portion 31c protruding from the<br>
lower surface of the main body portion 31a.<br>
The movable contact member 33 is horizontally arranged<br>
on the upper side of the main body portion 31a in such a<br>
pattern as to surround the shaft portion 31b of the inner<br>
rotor 31. The movable contact member 33 is provided with<br>
two interlocking lugs 33d arranged in diametrically opposite<br><br>
positions with respect to the rotational axis about which<br>
the movable contact member 33 rotates relative to the<br>
housing 2. The interlocking lugs 33d are formed to project<br>
downwardly by a bending work. The main body portion 31a of<br>
the inner rotor 31 has two vertically extending interlocking<br>
holes 31d formed in diametrically opposite positions with<br>
respect to the rotational axis (the center axis as viewed in<br>
a vertical direction) . The interlocking lugs 33d are<br>
respectively inserted into the interlocking holes 31d, so<br>
that the movable contact member 33 can be rotated together<br>
with the inner rotor 31.<br>
In this regard, the interlocking holes 31d are formed<br>
in the radial end portions of the main body portion 31a of<br>
the inner rotor 31. As compared to a case that the<br>
interlocking holes 31d would be formed near the center axis<br>
of the inner rotor 31, the pressure imparted on the inner<br>
surfaces of the interlocking holes 31d during operation<br>
becomes smaller, which helps reduce the wear of relevant<br>
parts.<br>
In this connection, one set of the interlocking lug<br>
33d and the interlocking hole 31d has a longitudinal width<br>
(a vertical dimension in Fig. 3A) greater than that of the<br>
other set, so that the interlocking lug 33d having the<br>
greater width cannot be fitted into the interlocking hole<br>
31d having the smaller width. This prevents the movable<br>
contact member 33 from being attached to the inner rotor 31<br><br>
in an inverted state. In the present embodiment, the<br>
interlocking lugs 33d are formed by the bending work.<br>
Therefore, it is easier to form the interlocking lugs 33d in<br>
different sizes as compared to a case that the interlocking<br>
lugs 33d are formed by an extruding work.<br>
Three contact pressure springs 39 each formed of a<br>
coil spring are arranged between the lower surface of the<br>
movable contact member 33 and the main body portion 31a of<br>
the inner rotor 31 at about 120 degree intervals when viewed<br>
from the bottom. The contact pressure springs 39 are<br>
received at their lower end portions within respective<br>
spring rest portions 31e formed in the upper surface of the<br>
main body portion 31a of the inner rotor 31 and are brought<br>
into elastic contact with the lower surface of the movable<br>
contact member 33 at their upper end portions. Thus, the<br>
movable contact member 33 is biased upwardly away from the<br>
inner rotor 31.<br>
A movable contact point 42 is provided in one of three<br>
points on the upper surface of the movable contact member 33<br>
that correspond to the contact pressure springs 39. In the<br>
remaining two points, two connection terminals 52 for making<br>
elastic contact with the counterpart connection terminal 51<br>
are formed by an embossing work to protrude in an upward<br>
direction. In other words, the fixed contact point 41 that<br>
makes contact with the movable contact point 42 is<br>
electrically connected to the counterpart connection<br><br>
terminal 51 through the movable contact member 33. The<br>
contact pressure of the movable contact point 42 against the<br>
fixed contact point 41 and the contact pressure of the<br>
connection terminals 52 against the counterpart connection<br>
terminal 51 are maintained by the biasing force of the<br>
contact pressure springs 39.<br>
The outer rotor 32 includes a downwardly opened main<br>
body portion 32a with a base wall, a flange portion 32b<br>
radially outwardly extending from the lower end of the main<br>
body portion 32a and a connecting portion 32c downwardly<br>
protruding from the outer edge of the flange portion 32b,<br>
the connecting portion 32c having a "U"-like shape when<br>
viewed from the bottom.<br>
As shown in Fig. 1A and 1B, the outer rotor 3 2 is<br>
bonded to the inner rotor 31, e.g., by ultrasonic wave<br>
bonding or laser bonding, in a state that the main body<br>
portion 3 2a thereof is inserted into the coupling portion<br>
31c of the inner rotor 31. A vertically extending insertion<br>
hole 32d for receiving the shaft portion 31b of the inner<br>
rotor 31 is formed in the base wall of the main body portion<br>
32a of the outer rotor 32.<br>
In this regard, four engaging lug portions 32e are<br>
formed on the outer circumferential surface of the main body<br>
portion 32a of the outer rotor 32 to protrude radially<br>
outwardly at about 90 degree intervals. Four engaging<br>
groove portions 31f are formed in the inner circumferential<br><br>
surface of the coupling portion 31c of the inner rotor 31 in<br>
about 90 degree intervals.<br>
The engaging lug portions 32e are engaged with the<br>
engaging groove portions 31f, whereby the inner rotor 31 is<br>
prevented from rotating relative to the outer rotor 32. One<br>
set of the engaging lug portion 32e and the engaging groove<br>
portion 31f has a width greater than that of the remaining<br>
sets. Therefore, the engaging lug portions 32e are not<br>
allowed to engage with the engaging groove portions 31f<br>
unless they are combined in a specified manner. This helps<br>
prevent the inner rotor 31 from being attached to the outer<br>
rotor 32 in a wrong direction.<br>
In a state that the rotary switch 1 is attached to the<br>
body frame B, one end of the stand S pivotally attached to<br>
the body frame B is interposed between the opposite end<br>
extensions of the connecting portion 32c of the outer rotor<br>
32. The other end (ground-contacting end) of the stand S is<br>
positioned on the right lower side in Fig. 1A and on the<br>
right side in Fig. 1B. When the stand S is rotated relative<br>
to the body frame B, the inner surface of the connecting<br>
portion 32c of the outer rotor 32 makes contact with the<br>
stand S and, therefore, the rotor 3 is rotated relative to<br>
the housing 2 together with the stand S, consequently<br>
changing over the contact and separation (namely, the<br>
contact point status) of the movable contact point 42 and<br>
each fixed contact point 41.<br><br>
A ring-shaped first oil seal 61 for preventing<br>
infiltration of rainwater or leakage of lubricant such as<br>
grease or the like through a gap between the rotor 3 and the<br>
housing 2 is arranged between the lower surface of the main<br>
body portion 31a of the inner rotor 31 and the upper surface<br>
of the flange portion 32b of the outer rotor 32 within the<br>
accommodating recess portion 20. Furthermore, a metal-made<br>
annular sliding plate 63 is arranged between the main body-<br>
portion 31a of the inner rotor 31 and the first oil seal 61<br>
in order to reduce the friction between the inner rotor 31<br>
and the first oil seal 61.<br>
A circular insertion hole 20a is formed in the center<br>
region of the bottom surface of the accommodating recess<br>
portion 2 0 to extend in a vertical direction. An annular<br>
surrounding protuberance 21a that surrounds the insertion<br>
hole 20a is formed on the upper surface of the housing 2 to<br>
protrude upwardly. The insertion hole 20a has an inner<br>
diameter greater than the outer diameter of the shaft<br>
portion 31b of the inner rotor 31. The shaft portion 31b of<br>
the inner rotor 31 is inserted into the insertion hole 20a,<br>
so that the rotor 3 is pivotally supported on the housing 2.<br>
The direction of the rotational axis about which the rotor 3<br>
rotates relative to the housing 2 is a vertical direction in<br>
Fig. 1B.<br>
A bolt (not shown) for attaching the rotor 3 to the<br>
stand S is fitted through the shaft portion 31b of the inner<br><br>
rotor 31. The bolt is mechanically coupled to the stand S,<br>
e.g., by threadedly engaging with a thread hole formed in<br>
the stand S. The bolt is provided with a flange portion<br>
(not shown) having a size great enough not to be inserted<br>
into the insertion hole 20a. The flange portion of the bolt<br>
is surrounded by the surrounding protuberance 21a of the<br>
housing 2. The flange portion serves to prevent the bolt<br>
from falling from the rotor 3.<br>
A ring-shaped second oil seal 62, the axis of which<br>
extends in a vertical direction, for preventing infiltration<br>
of rainwater or leakage of lubricant through a gap between<br>
the rotor 3 and the housing 2 is arranged between the inner<br>
circumferential surface of the insertion hole 20a and the<br>
outer circumferential surface of the shaft portion 31b of<br>
the inner rotor 31.<br>
The second oil seal 62 is provided at its upper end<br>
with a radially outwardly protruding flange portion 62a. A<br>
positioning jut portion 62b is formed to protrude radially<br>
outwardly from the outer circumferential surface of the<br>
flange portion 62a and a positioning groove portion 21c is<br>
formed on the upper surface of the housing 2. The<br>
positioning jut portion 62b engages into the positioning<br>
groove portion 21c, so that the second oil seal 62 is<br>
prevented from rotating relative to the housing 2. A notch<br>
21d communicating with the positioning groove portion 21c is<br>
formed in the surrounding protuberance 21a. The flange<br><br>
portion 62a of the second oil seal 62 is interposed between<br>
the lower surface of the flange portion of the bolt fitted<br>
through the shaft portion 31b of the inner rotor 31 and the<br>
upper surface of the housing 2.<br>
A cylindrical tubular protuberance 21b surrounding the<br>
insertion hole 2 0a is formed on the inner bottom surface of<br>
the accommodating recess portion 20 to protrude downwardly.<br>
The counterpart connection terminal 51 and the fixed contact<br>
point 41 are insert-molded and held in place by the housing<br>
2. The counterpart connection terminal 51 has an inner<br>
circumferential edge inserted into the tubular protuberance<br>
21b. The fixed contact point 41 has a radial outer end<br>
portion inserted into the inner circumferential surface of<br>
the accommodating recess portion 20.<br>
In this regard, a cylindrical sleeve block 34 covering<br>
the inner surface of the shaft portion 31b is attached to<br>
the inner rotor 31. The sleeve block 34 includes a metal-<br>
made sleeve body 34a constituting the inner circumferential<br>
surface of the sleeve block 34 and a protection layer 34b<br>
covering the outer circumferential surface of the sleeve<br>
body 34a, the protection layer 34b being made of synthetic<br>
resin that exhibits an alkali resistance higher than that of<br>
the inner rotor 31 and the outer rotor 32. Examples of the<br>
protection layer 34b include polyamide-based synthetic resin<br>
and polyphenylene sulfide (PPS) , both of which show a<br>
relatively high alkali resistance.<br><br>
In this connection, hydroxyl radicals may be generated<br>
in the ambient water, e.g., rainwater, by the ions emitted<br>
when the metal constituting the sleeve body 34a gets rusted.<br>
This would generate alkaline liquid that degrades the<br>
synthetic resin. In the present embodiment, it is possible<br>
for the protection layer 34b to restrain degradation of the<br>
inner rotor 31 and the outer rotor 32 which would otherwise<br>
caused by the alkaline liquid.<br>
The sleeve body 34a is formed of, e.g., steel plated<br>
with an anti-rust material. Use of nickel exhibiting a<br>
relatively high wear resistance as the anti-rust material is<br>
desirable in that the plated layer is seldom peeled off by<br>
the friction between the sleeve body 34a and the protection<br>
layer 34b, even if the sleeve body 34a is slid relative to<br>
the protection layer 34b and rotated together with a bolt<br>
during the course of tightening the bolt.<br>
The sleeve body 34a is integrated with the protection<br>
layer 34b by insert-molding. Similarly, the protection<br>
layer 34b is integrally formed with the inner rotor 31 by<br>
insert-molding. Groove portions 34c for inhibiting vertical<br>
displacement of the protection layer 34b relative to the<br>
sleeve body 34a are formed in the outer circumferential<br>
surface of the sleeve body 34a. Bulge portion 34d for<br>
inhibiting vertical displacement of the sleeve block 34<br>
relative to the inner rotor 31 are formed on the outer<br>
circumferential surface of the protection layer 34b.<br><br>
In the rotary switch as described above, the<br>
interlocking lugs 33d of the movable contact member 33 are<br>
formed by a bending work. This makes it possible to<br>
increase the protruding size of the interlocking lug 33d, as<br>
compared to a case that the interlocking lug .33d would be<br>
formed by an extruding work. Therefore, the interlocking<br>
lugs 3 3d are hardly removed from the corresponding<br>
interlocking holes 31d in the assembling process, which<br>
makes it possible to enhance the ease of assembly.<br>
Further, with the configuration described above, the<br>
metal-made sleeve body 34a enhances mechanical strength of<br>
the sleeve block 34. Therefore, it becomes possible to<br>
restrain breakage of the sleeve block 34 which would<br>
otherwise occur when a fixing bolt is tightened to the stand<br>
S.<br>
Therefore, in the first embodiment of the present<br>
invention, the mechanical strength of the rotor is increased<br>
by the sleeve. In this connection, the sleeve is plated with<br>
an anti-rust material because the rotary switch is generally<br>
used in outdoor.<br>
(Second Embodiment)<br>
Hereinafter, a second embodiment of the present<br>
invention will be described with reference to Figs. 4A to 8C.<br>
Figs. 4A to 4C show a rotary switch in accordance with<br>
the second embodiment of the present invention. Fig. 4A is a<br>
bottom view of the rotary switch, Fig. 4B is a section view<br><br>
taken along line A-A in Fig. 4A and Fig. 4C is a section<br>
view taken along line B-B in Fig. 4A. Fig. 5 is an exploded<br>
perspective view of the rotary switch shown in Figs. 4A to<br>
4C.<br>
Fig. 6 is a top view illustrating a state that a<br>
movable contact member and a contact pressure spring are<br>
attached to an inner rotor of the rotary switch in Fig. 5.<br>
Fig. 7 is a section view taken along line B-B in Fig. 6.<br>
In the first embodiment of the present invention, the<br>
sleeve body 34a is integrated with the protection layer 34b<br>
by insert-molding. Similarly, the protection layer 34b is<br>
integrally formed with the inner rotor 31 by insert-molding<br>
as shown in Figs. 3A and 3B. However, in the second<br>
embodiment as described in later section, a sleeve 35 is<br>
integrally formed with a main body portion 32a of an outer<br>
rotor 32 by insert-molding.<br>
Further, there is provided a retainer rim portion 32h<br>
formed on an upper surface of the main body portion 32 of<br>
the outer rotor 32 in such as manner as to protrude upwardly.<br>
In the present embodiment, like parts as in the first<br>
embodiment will be designated by like reference numerals and<br>
redundant description thereof will be omitted.<br>
In the same manner of the first embodiment, the outer<br>
rotor 32, as shown in Fig. 8, includes a downwardly opened<br>
main body portion 32a with a base wall, a flange portion 32b<br>
radially outwardly extending from the lower end of the main<br><br>
body portion 32a and a connecting portion 32c downwardly<br>
protruding from the outer edge of the flange portion 32b,<br>
the connecting portion 32c having a "U"-like shape when<br>
viewed from the bottom.<br>
A cylindrical sleeve 35 through which the upper and<br>
lower sides of the outer rotor 32 communicate with each<br>
other is integrally formed with the main body portion 32a of<br>
the outer rotor 32 by insert-molding. The sleeve 35 is<br>
formed of, e.g., steel plated with an anti-rust material<br>
such as nickel or the like. The sleeve 35 has a lower end<br>
surface generally flush with the inner bottom surface of the<br>
main body portion 32a of the outer rotor 32 and an upper end<br>
portion protruding above the outer rotor 32.<br>
A cylindrical retainer rim portion 32h surrounding the<br>
lower end portion of the sleeve 35 is formed on the upper<br>
surface of the main body portion 32a of the outer rotor 32<br>
in such as manner as to protrude upwardly.<br>
As shown in Figs. 4A to 4C, the outer rotor 32 is<br>
bonded to the inner rotor 31, e.g., by ultrasonic wave<br>
bonding or laser bonding, in a state that the main body<br>
portion 32a thereof is inserted into the coupling portion<br>
31c of the inner rotor 31 and the sleeve 35 is inserted into<br>
a shaft portion 31b of the inner rotor 31. The upper end of<br>
the sleeve 35 is flush with the upper end surface of the<br>
shaft portion 31b of the inner rotor 31. Further, an annular<br>
recess portion 31g receiving the retainer rim portion 32h of<br><br>
the outer rotor 32 is formed in a lower surface of the main<br>
body portion 31a of the inner rotor 31.<br>
A bolt (not shown) for attaching the rotor 3 to the<br>
stand S is inserted through the sleeve 35. That is to say,<br>
a bolt insertion hole recited in the claims is formed inside<br>
the sleeve 35. The bolt is mechanically coupled to the<br>
stand S, e.g., by threadedly engaging with a thread hole<br>
formed in the stand S. The bolt is provided with a flange<br>
portion (not shown) having a size great enough not to be<br>
inserted into the insertion hole 20a. The flange portion of<br>
the bolt is surrounded by the surrounding protuberance 21a<br>
of the housing 2. The flange portion serves to prevent the<br>
bolt from falling from the sleeve 35.<br>
The flange portion 62a of the second oil seal 62 is<br>
interposed between the lower surface of the flange portion<br>
of the bolt inserted into the sleeve 35 and the upper<br>
surface of the housing 2.<br>
In this regard, eight radially outwardly protruding<br>
anti-rotation lug portions 3 5a are formed on the outer<br>
circumferential surface of the lower end portion of the<br>
sleeve 3 5 at regular intervals along the circumferential<br>
direction of the sleeve 35. The outer rotor 32 is partially<br>
inserted between the circumferentially neighboring anti-<br>
rotation lug portions 35a. In other words, the anti-<br>
rotation lug portions 35a come into contact with the lower<br>
surface of the outer rotor 32, i.e., the opposite surface<br><br>
from the surface (upper surface) facing the head portion of<br>
the bolt.<br>
With such configuration, rotation of the sleeve 35<br>
relative to the outer rotor 32 is restrained by the force<br>
acting between the anti-rotation lug portions 35a and the<br>
outer rotor 32. This helps prevent loss of the anti-rust<br>
plating effect for the sleeve 35 which would otherwise be<br>
caused by the friction between the inner rotor 31 or the<br>
outer rotor 3 2 and the sleeve 35.<br>
In case, the sleeve 35 is insert-molded with the inner<br>
rotor 31 as in the first embodiment, the inner rotor 31,<br>
receives the torque of the sleeve 35 during the process of<br>
tightening the bolt fitted through the sleeve 35, so that<br>
stresses are generated in the coupling portion of the inner<br>
rotor 31 and the outer rotor 32 which shows relatively low<br>
mechanical strength in the rotor 3. However, in the present<br>
embodiment, this is not the case because the sleeve 35 is<br>
insert-molded with the outer rotor 32.<br>
While the invention has been shown and described with<br>
respect to the embodiments, it will be understood by those<br>
skilled in the art that various changes and modification may<br>
be made without departing from the scope of the invention as<br>
