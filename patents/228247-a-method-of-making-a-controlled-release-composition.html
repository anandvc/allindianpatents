				<td>METHOD FOR THE PREPARATION OF CONTROLLED RELEASE FORMULATIONS<br>
Fteld of the Invention<br>
The present Invention relates to a method of making controlled release compositions; and, specifically to a method of contacting an organic solution containing a bloactive agent and a polymer with an aqueous solution containing an organic ion through an emulsion process to create controlled release compositions. The present Invention further provides methods of using controlled release compositions including a polymer, an organic ton and a bloactive agent<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Currently there are numerous controlled release formulations on the market that contain various bioactlve agents, such as GnRH analogs, human growth hormone, risperidone and somatostatin analogs of which octreotide acetate is an example. These controlled release compositions are typically formulated with biodegradable, btocompatlbJe polymers. Such formulations are preferred by healthcare professionals and their patients because they reduce the need for multiple injections. Additionally, sirra one injection treats a patiert time, health care organizations prefer them because they decrease the number of office visits per patient, which works to decrease health care costs.<br>
Unfortunately, there are many problems with the current production processes and formulations for controlled release compositions. Many current manufacturing processes are Incapable of producing concentrated product exhibiting a high drug load, thus necessitating a large intramuscular injection volume (2 ml) that Is quite uncomfortable for the patient when administered. Additionally, many methods require time consuming and complex procedures to solubllize bioactive agents prior to encapsulation; and manipulation of solubility for purposes of encapsulation can result in deleterious release profiles, as well as degradation of the bioactive agent Itself. For example, the use of highly water soluble bloactive agents frequently results in an undesirable "burst" of bloactive agent upon contact with an aqueous solution, such as by administration to a patient or introduction to a physiological medium. Such a rapid rise In levels of bioactive agent can be<br><br>
detrimental to a patient and may leave little btoactive agent for later release over the desired treatment time course.<br>
Various methods of solving the solubility problem have been attempted but none have been particularly efficient or effective. One such attempt combined a 5     bioactive agent with a surfactant molecule, comprising an anionte head and a hydrophobia tail, to solubilize the btoactive agent In an organic phase prior to encapsulation. Another method combined organic acids with the bioactive agent to produce a water Insoluble addition salt prior to encapsulation. The use of an insoluble additional salt resulted In a lessening of the "burst" effect upon<br>
    administration; however, this method required additional manufacturing procedures that made production of these compounds expensive and inefficient Another method included encapsulation of the acetate salt of the bioactive agent that resulted In substantial amounts of chemically modified or degraded bioactive agent being released after placement in an aqueous physiological buffer. Chemical degradation<br>
    was in the form of undesirable acylation of the bioactive agent<br>
Methods of producing controlled release compositions that are capable of producing a product with a high drug load, minimum burst effect upon administration and minimum degradation of the bioactive agent are greatiy needed to realize the true benefits of these types of compositions as human or veterinary therapeutics.<br>

Example 1<br>
Conventional Preparation of Octreotlde Acetate Encapsulated In Poty(lactide-co-Qlycollde) (PLGA) Mlcropartlclea Using Co-Solvents According to Previously Uaed Methods.<br>
Octreotlde acetate mlcropartlcle formulations were prepared to Investigate the effect of different co-solvents In the organic phase. Formulations A-F were prepared using an oiMn-water emulsion/solvent extraction technique, are summarized In Table 1. PLGA polymer (50:50 lactkte/glycoflde, MW 24,000,180 mg) was dissolved in ethyl acetate (EtOAc, 900 uL), and octreotide acetate (20 mg) dissolved in a co-solvent (Table 1) was added to the polymer solution. The resulting homogeneous organic phase was added to an aqueous phase (2 mL) containing 1% poiy(vlrtyl alcohol) (PVA) and the mixture was vortexed for 15-30 seconds. The emulsion was poured Into a solvent extraction solution (10 mM sodium phosphate, pH 8.0,150 ml) and stirred for four hours to extract EtOAc. Particles were Isolated by filtration, washed with water and air dried overnight. The formulations were characterized by particle size, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), morphology, octreotide core load and In vitro release profiles.<br>
Formulation D was repeated using an emulsifying device, such as that disclosed in PCT Application Serial No. PCT/US04/11485, that combined a homogeneous organic phase (2 mL) consisting of octreotide acetate (20 mg), MeOH (100nL), PLGA polymer (50:50 lactlde/glycollde, MW 24,000,180 mg) and EtOAc (1.9 mL) with a 1% PVA aqueous phase (4 mL). The emulsion was then added to a<br>
solvent extraction solution and stirred for four hours to extract EtOAc. This process produced formulation D2 (Table 1).<br>
The co-solvents Investigated had a small Influence on particle size and core load. Particle sizes were larger with the higher viscosity poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) co-solvents. In contrast, core toads were similar for the methanol (MeOH) and PEG co-solvents (formulations A-C). The highest core loads were obtained for the MeOH cosolvent with a pH 8 buffered emulsion step (formulation D2) and for the dimethyl sulfoxlde (DMSO) cosolvent (formulation F).<br>
In vitro release kinetics were measured In either phosphate buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.2,37°C) or 100 mM sodium acetate (NaOAc, pH 4.0,37°C). An example Is shown in Table 2 (Formulation D2). The PEG co-solvent systems showed the highest initial peptide burst (8-10%), while the remaining formulations had an initial burst In the range of 2-3%. All the formulations released peptide for at least 6 weeks although there was a decrease In the relative release rates for formulations prepared With polar aprotic solvents (formulations E - F) resulting In lower total release of peptide relative to the other formulations.<br>
Octreotlde acetate as the free peptide was measured to be 95% Intact by high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) following incubation in the release medium (PBS, pH 7.2,37°C) after 49 days. In contrast, Incubation of octreotlde acetate PLGA mtcroparttcle formulations produced 55% of modified peptide species after 70 days In the release medium (PBS, pH 7.2,37°C, Table 2). HPLC analysis showed that the new peptide entities were more hydrophobia than native octreotide acetate. HPLC/MS analysis revealed masses consistent with acylation of the parent peptide by PLGA polymer. The masses found were consistent with random acylation, for example, peptide plus one or two gtycollc or lactic add monomers In any combination. It may be that acylation products arise from attack on PLGA fragments or the polymer backbone by nucleophilic moieties In octreotlde. At a lower pH these moieties likely would be protonated reducing their nucteophlllclty and consequently the amount of acylated product It was observed that formation of acylated byproducts for octreotlde acetate PLGA mteroparticles Incubated In 100 mM sodium acetate (NaOAc, pH 4.0) buffer was reduced to 1.25% at 49 days, in marked contrast to the results for PBS buffer (55%).<br>

Production of Water Insoluble Organic Acid Salts (Complexes) of Octreotlde and Encapsulation In PLGA Mlcropartides According to Previously Used Methods.<br>
Organic ion agents were Investigated where the organic Ion was Initially complexed with octreotkte acetate to form a water insoluble salt fotlowed by encapsulation in PLOA micropartides.<br>
Sodium Dodecvlsulfate (SDSV        An octreotkJe-SDS complex was prepared by dissolving octreotide acetate (100 mg) In H2O (500 \iL). SDS (1.5 equlv, 43.2 mg) dissolved In HzO (500 jit) was added drop wise to the octreotide acetate solution with vortexkig at room temperature. A precipitate Immediately formed. The sample was centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 1 minute and the supernatant removed by pipette. The precipitate was washed with cold water and lyophlllzed providing an octreotide-SDS complex (95.3 mg). RP-HPLC analysis showed a pronounced broadening of the octreotide peak Indicating formation of the octreotide/SDS complex. Formulations G-l were prepared using an oil-in-water emulsion/solvent extraction technique. PLGA polymer (MW 24,000,180 mg) was dissolved in EtOAc (900 nL). OctreotkWSDSoxTtp^wa8dte8oh^lnMeOH(100^L)arxladdedtD the polymer solution. This resulted in a heterogeneous organic phase. In the case of formulation I (Tabte 3) an additional aliquot of MeOH (100 uL) was added to produce a homogeneous organic phase. The resulting organic phase was added to an aqueous phase (2 ml_) containing 1% PVA and the mixture was vortexed for 15 - 30 seconds. The emulsion was poured into a solvent extraction solution (10 mM sodium phosphate, pH 8.0,150 ml) and stirred for four hours to extract EtOAc. Particles were Isolated by filtration, washed with water and air dried overnight. The formulations were characterized by particle size, SEM morphology, octreotide core load and In vitro release profiles.<br>
The measured core load for formulations G-l prepared from the octreotide-SDS complex were relatively low, between 0.6-2.6% (Table 3). Ateo the median particle size was reduced by approximately 40% relative to formulations (A-F) prepared with octreotide acetate.<br>
The In vitro release profiles of formulations G-l in PBS were quite similar,, Each had an Initial burst of approximately 20% followed by three weeks of 1.5% release/week. After three weeks the rate of release Increased to approximately 7.0 % release/week, culminating In approximately 80% total peptide release at 9 weeks.<br>
The In vitro PBS release assay with these formulations resulted in the release of similar amounts of acylated (40-55%) and total peptide compared to octreotide acetate (formulations A-F).<br>

polymer (MW 24,000,180 mg) and benzote acid (2.4-24 mg) were dissolved in EtOAc (900 |iL). Octreotide acetate was dissolved in MeOH (100 uL) and added to the polymer solution yielding a homogeneous organic phase. The resulting organic phase was added to an aqueous phase (2 ml) containing 1% PVA and the mixture was vortexed for 15 - 30 seconds. The emulsion was poured Into a solvent extraction solution (10 mM sodium phosphate, pH 8.0,150 mL) and stirred for four hours to extract EtOAc. Particles were isolated by filtration, washed with water and air dried overnight The core loads measured between 0.88-1.67% over the range of 1-10 added equivalents of benzole acid per equivalent of octreotide acetate (Table 4).<br>
PamoicAcid.	An octreotide-pamoate complex was prepared by<br>
dissolving pamote add (19.4 mg, 0.05 mmol) In 0.2 N NaOH (500 jiL) to provide the sodium pamoate salt. Octreotide acetate (100 mg, 0.10 mmol) was dissolved In defonlzed water (100 nL) and added drop wise with gentle vortexlng to the sodium pamoate salt solution. This produced a flocculent light yellow precipitate. The precipitate was pelleted by centrif ugatton, and the supernatant removed by pipette. The pellet was washed with water (1.0 ml_), re-suspended In water and lyophlllzed to a light yellow powder (113 mg). The octreotide/pamoate ratio of this preparation was 1.71 as measured by RP-HPLC.<br>
A second octreotide-pamoate complex was prepared by dissolving pamoic acid (19.4 mg, 0.05 mmol) In 0.4 N NaOH (250 nL) and dtoxane (250 uL) to provide a solution of sodium pamoate in dloxane/water (1:1). Octreotide acetate (50 mg, 0.05 mmol) was dissolved in dloxane/water (1:1,200 \il). The octreotide acetate solution was added drop wise to the sodium pamoate with mixing to provide a light yellow, homogenous solution. This material was lyophlllzed to dryness providing a light yellow powder (65 mg). The octreotide/pamoate ratio of this preparation was 1.02 as measured by RP-HPLC. These two preparations were used to prepare new PLGA mlcroparticle formulations.<br>

Attorney Docket No.: 007184-17<br>
Express Mall Label No.: US 330070825 US<br>
dissolved In EtOAc (1000 μL). Octreotide pamoate (20 or 40 mg) was dissived in-benzyl alcohol (BnOH, 1000 )iL) and added to the polymer solution yielding a homogeneous organic phase. The resulting organic phase was combined with a 1% FVA aqueous phase In a ratio of1:2 to provide an emulsion. The emulsion was collected directly into a 0.3% PVA solvent extraction solution (150 mL) and stirred for four hours to extract EtOAc. Hardened mlcropartfcles were collected by filtration, washed with water, air dried and stored at 4°C.<br>
Formulation characterization (Table 5) revealed that the initial octreotide/pamoate ratio of 1.7 had little effect on the encapsulation efficiency and core load relative to the formulations prepared with the octreotide/pamoate ratio of 1.02. In contrast, changing the co-solvent to benzyl alcohol increased the encapsulation efficiency by approximately 60% relative to methanof (e.g. Formulation S compared to T).<br>
The in vitro release profiles of these formulations In PBS demonstrated total peptlde released (79-92%, Table 5 Q-T) is comparable to PLGA octreotkJe acetate mteropartfctes made by conventional methods (formulations D, F Table 1) white the amount of acyteted peptkie released (28-40%, Table 5 Q-T) Is decreased slightly relative to conventional formulations (44-55%, Table 1, A-D).<br>
Formulations prepared using the octreotide/pamoate ratio of 1:1 did not show as strong a dependence of encapsulation efficiency and core toad on the nature of the co-solvent as the 1.7 ratio formulations above. The differences in solubility tor the complexes with different octreotide/pamoate ratios in the co-solvent is proposed as an explanation for this observation. The higher octreotide/pamoate ratio material had an Increased solubility in benzyl alcohol relative to methanol resulting in higher encapsulation efficiency. In contrast, it was found that there was no significant difference in solubility In methanol versus benzyl alcohol for the 1:1 octreotide/pamoate complex. This resulted In similar encapsulation efficiencies and core toads Independent of the co-solvents.<br>
The In vitro release profiles of these 1:1 formulations (U-W) reveal similar trends as discussed above, namely, that the total percent of peptlde released (85 -110%, Table 5 U-W) is again comparable to conventional formulations (Example 1)<br>
Attorney Docket No.: 007184-17 Express Mail Label No.: US 330070825 US<br>
(ca. 85%, Table 2)'while the amount of acytated product released (35-44% Table 5-U-W) Is decreased somewhat relative to conventional formulations (44-55%, Table 1, A-D2).<br>
Analysis of the final octreotide/pamoate molar ratio showed a wide variation among the formulations tested (Table 5) with a range from 2.1:1 (formulation W) to over 200:1 (formulation R). In all cases the ratio Is more than twice the octreotide/pamoate ratio of the starting peptide salt complex. Thus the use of a preformed pamoate salt of the peptide octreotide yielded highly variable octreotide/pamoate molar ratios In the final sustained release formulation.<br>

Encapsulation In PLGA Mlcrospheres Using Organic Add Salts In the Aqueous Emulsion Phase According to the Present Invention.<br>
Surprisingly it was discovered that the use of an organic acid salt In the aqueous phase of the emulslfication process allowed use of a water soluble peptWe and eliminated the need to prepare complexed species in an Independent step prior to preparing the formulation. The present Invention provided added benefits such as increased drug coreload, consistent octreotlde/organic ion ratio, and decreased peptWe degradation during In vitro release.<br>
Microparticte formulations were prepared by an oll-in-water emulsion/solvent extraction method. PLGA polymer (MW 24,000,140 -180 mg) was dissolved In EtOAc (1000 μL). Octreotlde acetate (20 -60 mg) was dissolved In BnOH (1000 nL)<br>
and added to the polymer solution yielding a homogenous organic phase. The resulting organic phase was combined with a 1% PVA aqueous phase containing 10-50 mM dlsodium pamoate to provide an emulsion. The emulsion was collected directly Into a 0.3% PVA solvent extraction solution (150 mL) and stirred forfour hours to extract EtOAc. Hardened microparticles were collected by filtration, washed with water, air dried and stored at 4°C. This resulted In a final octreotide/pamoate ratio of approximately 1-1.5 in the microparticle formulation measured by RP-HPLC (Table6).<br>
The effects of various experimental parameters on core load were Investigated including organic to aqueous phase ratio, nature of co-solvent, and volume of co-solvent BnOH was found to be a more suitable co-solvent than MeOH. It was possible to use BnOH in larger volumes than MeOH, as MeOH induced polymer precipitation in the organic phase. BnOH also led to a small Increase in core load versus MeOH (Formulation Y, AB, Table 6). However, the use of BnOH without the organic ton in the aqueous phase did not provide high core loads or encapsulation efficiencies (Al, Table 6). It was also found that increasing the aqueous to organic phase ratio Increased the encapsulation efficiency slightly when BnOH was used as the co-80»vent(Formulatk)n8AE,AF, Table 6). In all cases the molar ratio of octreotide to pamoate was tightly grouped between 1.0 and 1.5, In contrast to the formulations of Example 2 (Table 5) where the use of a preformed octreotide/pamoate complex led to wide variations of the final octreotide/pamoate ratio from 2.1 to over 200.<br>
Significantly, product with predictable and elevated drug core loads ranging from 5-17.5% could be formed with the method of the present invention, (formulations AD, AQ, AH, Table 6), in contrast to the prior art methods of Examples 1 and 2 where the maximum drug core load achieved was about 8% (Table 5 - S) with averages ranging from 2-6% (Tables 1-5). In addition, the compositions of the present invention have consistent stolchiometry for the molar ratio of bioactfve agent to organic Ion (Table 6). This Is In contrast to the compositions made using previous methods (Table 5).  Furthermore, the relative production of acylated peptide is lower for mfcroparticles made with the organic ion in the aqueous phase (Table 2, Table 6) than for microparticles made with the use of preformed octreotide-pamoate (Table 5) or octreotide acetate (Table 2).<br>

The effect of organic add concentration in the aqueous phase was explored to determine the optimal manufacturing parameters. PLGA polymer (MW 24,000, 160 mg) was dissolved In EtOAc (1000 jit). Octreotide acetate (40 mg) was dissolved in BnOH (1000 fiL) and added to the polymer solution yielding a homogenous organic phase. The resulting organic phase was combined with a 1% PVA aqueous phase containing 20 or 50 mM sodium pamoate to provide an emulsion. The emulsion was collected directly Into a 0.3% PVA solvent extraction solution (150 mL) and stirred for four hours to extract EtOAc. Hardened mlcropartfcles were collected by filtration, washed with water, air dried and stored at 4°C. Formulations AJ - AL show that 20 or 50 mM disodlum pamoate had no effect on core load relative to 10 mM dlsodium pamoate (Table 7). However, the dlsodium pamoate concentration In the aqueous phase did have a measurable effect on the 'day one" in vitro PBS release. The formulation prepared using 50 mM disodlum pamoate resulted In a 15% burst (Formulation AL, Table 7) as compared to less than 4% burst for formulations prepared with 20 mM organic ion (Formulations AJ, AK, Table 7). This suggests that excess organic Ion In the aqueous phase Is deleterious to the in vitro release performance of the formulations.<br>

Alternative organic ions In addition to pamoate were investigated to explore the general utility of the present Invention. Microparticle formulations were prepared by an oiWn-water emulsion/solvent extraction method. PLGA polymer (MW 24,000, 160 mg) was dissolved In EtOAc (1000 |iL). Octreotide acetate (40 mg) was<br>
dissolved in BnOH (1000 nL) and added to the polymer solution yielding a homogenous organic phase. The resulting organic phase was combined with a 1% PVA aqueous phase containing 10-20 mM organic acid as Its sodium salt to provide an emulsion. The emulsion was collected directly Into a 0.3% PVA solvent extraction solution (150 ml) and stirred for four hours to extract EtOAc. Hardened mteropartlcles were collected by filtration, washed with water, air dried and stored at 4°C. This resulted In mlcroparticle formulations with octreotide core loads between 6.8 and 15.3% as measured by RP-HPLC (Table 8). The effects of the tested organic ions on core toad are revealing. Formulations AM - AP show no increase in the measured core load relative to control containing sodium pamoate (Formulations AT, All, AY, Table 8). In contrast formulations AQ-AS, AV-AX and AZ-BB, which employed organic adds ranging from cholte add to blcyllc aromatics, provided peptide core loads comparable to pamolc add (Table 8). These results imply that organic adds with appropriate phystochemical properties can be substituted for pamolc add to produce comparable mlcropartide formulations. <br>
