				<td>This invention relates to a Homoeopathic composition for the treatment of<br>
Cancer.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
Cancer is the second most common cause of death. The cause of most cancers<br>
remains unknown, recent research has led to significant advances in<br>
understanding the molecular basis of the malignant prolifiration of cells.<br>
Mutation in DNA Sequences leading to amplification or increased expression of<br>
"Oncogenes" or deletion of "tumor" suppression genes - or both processes have<br>
been linked to abnormal prolification and malignant convertion. Oncogenes are<br>
usually normal genes that encode for cellular growth factor receptors, growth<br>
factors or elements of the prolifirative machinery of the cancer cell. Tumor<br>
supression genes encode for regulatory proteins that normally supress cellular<br>
prolification. The consequence of these and other mutations that may be due to<br>
environmental exposure, genetic susceptibility, infectious agents and other<br>
unknown factors - is the disease process called cancer. The majority of cancers<br>
in adults are thought to be due to combination of factors associated with<br>
lifestyle and environmental exposure. Infection with HIV has been associated<br>
with an increased risk of cancer, especially non-Hodgkin"s lymphoma,<br>
Hodgkin"s disease, Keposie"s surcoma, and cervical and anal cancer.<br>
Most cancers present initially as localized tumor nodules and cause local<br>
symptoms. Depending on the type of cancer, initial therapy may be directed<br>
locally in the form of surgery or radiation therapy. Surgical Excision or local<br>
radiation (or both) is the treatment of choice for a variety of potentially curable<br>
cancers, including most gastro intestinal and genito urinary cancers, central<br>
nervous system tumors and cancers arising from the breast, thyroid or skin as<br>
well as most sarcomas.<br>
Radiation therapy has both acute and late toxicity. Acute toxicity may include<br>
generalized fatigue and malaise, anorexia, nausea and vomiting, local skin<br>
changes, diarrhoea and mucosal ulceration of the irradiated area. Radiation of<br>
large areas specially the pelvis and proximal long bones may result in<br>
significant bone marrow supression. Radiation of the lungs, heart and<br>
gastrointestinal tract must be approached with caution and with appropriate<br>
shielding to avoid severe toxicity. Long term toxicity can include<br>
hyperpigmentation of the involved skin decreased function of the irradiated<br>
organ, myelopathy, bone necrosis and secondary malignancy.<br>
Chemotherapy is used to cure a small percentage of malignancy, as adjuvant<br>
therapy to decrease the rate of relapse or improve the disease free internal and to<br>
palliate symptoms in some patients with incurable malignancies.<br>
So, it is shown that radiotherapy and chemotherapy are all palliative nature of<br>
treatment and has so many toxic effect after treatment. So those treatments has<br>
no fruitful results for cancer patients.<br>
The object of this invention is to obviate the above drawbacks and to develop a<br>
new approach for treating the cancer.<br>
A new approach has been developed which is based on enhancing cell mediated<br>
and humoral immunity by selected Homoeopathic drugs of herbal, minerals<br>
salts and nosodes origin and simultaneously stimulating the physiological<br>
functions of the body for the treatment of all types of cancer. It destroys and<br>
simultaneously resist the further destruction of the malignant cells and<br>
metastasis process. An additional advantage of our new approach is the absence<br>
of adverse reaction of the treatment.<br>
The drug used in our new approach for the treatment of cancer consists of multi-<br>
component drugs of Homoeopathic origin called "CANCER CURE" medicine.<br>
According to this invention Homoeopathic composition for treating cancer<br>
comprises the following ingredient in the proportion given below:<br>
The liquid form of ingredients 1, 2, 3, 4 and 6 are prepared as given below :<br>
Class -VII<br>
Mix one part weight of medicinal substances to 9 parts by weight of sugar of<br>
milk and triturate the mixture in pestle and Morter gives the lx trituration<br>
potency.<br>
Next 2x potency one gram of the lx Trituration of medicine add 9 parts by<br>
weight of sugar of milk and triturate the substance.<br>
Next 3x potency - One gram of the 2x trituration mixed with 9 parts by weight<br>
of sugar of milk and triturate the substance.<br>
Next 4x potency - One gram of 3x potency plus 9 parts of the sugar of milk and<br>
triturate the substance.<br>
Next 5x potency - One gram of the 4x potency plus 9 parts of the sugar of milk<br>
and triturate the substance.<br>
Next 6x potency - One part of the 5x potency plus 9 parts of the sugar of milk<br>
and triturate the substance.<br>
Conversion to the liquid potency:<br>
One gram of the 6x trituration dissolved in 50 minims of purified water and<br>
mixed with 50 minims of alcohol gives the 8x potency - in liquid form.<br>
Class V-A<br>
One part by weight of the medicinal substance is dissolved in 9 parts by weight<br>
of purified water. It is correspond to the 1x potency - under decimal scale. One<br>
minim of the solution (1x potency) and 9 minims of purified water given 2x<br>
potency.<br>
One minim of the 2x potency and 9 minims of dilute alcohol give the 3x<br>
potency.<br>
Class V-B<br>
One part by weight of the medicinal substance is dissolved in 99 parts by weight<br>
of purified water - it is corresponds to the 2x potency.<br>
Class - l<br>
Tinctures prepared with equal parts by weight of juice and alcohol.<br>
2 minims (drop) of tincture and 8 minims of dilute alcohol are mixed to get lx<br>
potency.<br>
Class Vlll<br>
One minim of the substance to 99 parts of sugar of milk and triturate the<br>
substance gives lx (Trituration)<br>
Next 2x - One part by weight of the lx plus 99 parts by weight of sugar of milk<br>
and triturate.<br>
Next 3x - One part by weight of the 2x potency plus 99 parts by weight of sugar<br>
of milk and triturate.<br>
Conversion into liquid potency:<br>
One gram of 3x (Trit) dissolved into 50 minims of purified water and mixed<br>
with 50 minims of alcohol gives the 4th potency.<br>
5th Potency : One minim of 4th potency plus 50 minims of purified water plus<br>
50 minims of alcohol.<br>
6th Potency : One minim of 5th potency plus 50 minims of purified water plus<br>
50 minims of alcohol.<br>
"CANCER CURE" medicine is prepared by the compositions of multiple drugs.<br>
After compilled those medicines with alcohol and Acqua - distilled it is<br>
filtrated ¾ times during the requisite time which is to completely filtrate the<br>
substance.<br>
After filtering the medicine is kept in a glass container contains 60 ml. During<br>
the course of treatment all other system of medicines strictly prohibited.<br>
The medicine should be keep away from sun-light, bright-light, strong odour,<br>
fumes etc.<br>
DOSAGE<br>
Two tea spoon full daily at bed time.<br>
The patients are suffering from Cancer. Diagnosed by U.S.G. or Biopsy and<br>
M.R.I. had taken "CANCER CURE" Medicine daily at bed time. After 16-24<br>
weeks period of treatment U.S.G. and blood picture MRI impression showed<br>
improvement and also patient himself felt relief from the suffering disease<br>
symptoms and all the signs by which we come to the diagnosis of Cancer. So<br>
whenever it is confirmed that the patient become recover from Cancer then we<br>
discontinued the "CANCER CURE" medicine, only give observations<br>
medicine, only give observations medicine further 4-6 months.<br>
CASE-I<br>
A retroperitonial lymphnode hyperplasia - Patient has to be given "CANCER<br>
CURE" medicine daily at bed time with other necessary S.O.S. Homoeopathic<br>
Medicine, for 6 months. After completing the full course of treatment the<br>
further C.T. Scan or Abdomen investigation shows normal study impression.<br>
CASE-2<br>
A case of Multiple Myeloma patient has to be given "CANCER CURE"<br>
medicine daily at bed time with other S.O.S. Homoeopathic Medicines for<br>
treatment. After completing the full course of treatment the further urine<br>
electrophosisis shows no proteinurea but previous test showed "M" bend in<br>
Gama Region.<br>
CASE-3<br>
A patient of a highly necrotic tumor showing pleomorphic tumor cells exibiting<br>
anisocytosis, anicnucleosis and tumor giant cell formation. Fasciculation of<br>
tumor cells is noted. Vascular endothelial proliferation is a prominent feature -<br>
diagnosed as Glioblastoma Multiforme.<br>
The patient was under our treatment and was taking "CANCER CURE"<br>
medicine with S.O.S. H4omeopathic medicines during 6 months. After<br>
completing the course it is found that tumor cells are destroyed and vascular<br>
proliferation reduced.<br>
CASE-4<br>
A patient of infiltration deposite ductal carcinoma and mamography shows left<br>
breast adhesive clastured calcification and was under our treatment and taking<br>
"CANCER CURE" medicine with S.O.S. Homoeopathic medicines. After<br>
completing the schedule course, it is found by X-Ray chest thaat lung fields<br>
clear, bony cage appear normal.<br>
