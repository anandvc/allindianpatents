				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a lift loading platform system for fixing on to vehicles, with a<br>
platform and a largely parallelogram-shaped lifting unit that comprises of two<br>
horizontally distanced support arms for supporting the platform, a parallel cylinder for<br>
tilting the platform from its vertical running position to its horizontal working position<br>
and vice-versa, as well as a lifting cylincer for raising and lowering the platform in its<br>
working position, whereby the lifting cy inder grips on to a lifting cylinder lever that can<br>
be turned around the swivel axis of the support arms, and forms a triangle of forces with<br>
it, and whereby the first support arm is elastically coupled in a movable manner with the<br>
lifting cylinder lever in lifting direction and the other, second support arm is connected to<br>
the lifting cylinder lever by means of a torsion profile.<br>
PRIOR ART<br>
Such a lift loading platform system is, fcr example, known through EP-A-0 980 786.<br>
In the lift loading platform systems known from EP-A-0 980 786, the lifting cylinder<br>
lever is horizontally shifted against the allocated first support arm. The lifting cylinder<br>
lever and the first support arm are supported in a rotate-able manner around the common<br>
rotation axis, independent of one another, and connected to one another at a radial<br>
distance to the common rotation axis by a bolt, so that the platform-sided free end of the<br>
first support arm is coupled with the lifting cylinder lever in lifting direction, allowing<br>
elastic spring movement. After lifting the platform to the height of the truck loading-<br>
surface, a further lifting movement of the lifting cylinder lever is possible through further<br>
loading of the lifting cylinder; this movement is transmitted through the torsion pipe to<br>
the second support arm. In this way, one can achieve a clearance-free transition from the<br>
platform to the truck loading-floor, even in case of one-sided loading of the platform.<br>
Another lift loading platform system is known from EP-A-0 808 747, in which the first<br>
support arm is arranged between two parallel distanced arms. Both these arms form a<br>
triangle of forces with the lifting cylinder and are rotate-able around the rotation axis of<br>
both support arms. The first support arm is welded to both arms at a radial distance to its<br><br>
rotation axis by means of a cross traverse, so that its platform-sided free end can be<br>
coupled with the lift drive in lifting direction, with a provision for elastic spring<br>
movement.<br>
Besides, from EP-A-1 106 431 we know of a lift loading system, in which on to the arm<br>
forming a triangle of forces with the lifting cylinder a spring is supported that supports<br>
the platform at the other end. With the help of the spring the platform is coupled with the<br>
lifting drive, enabling an elastic spring movement in lifting direction.<br>
A lift loading platform system with a horizontal parallel arm arranged beside the first<br>
support arm is known from EP-A-1 221 399, that is supported rotate-able around the<br>
common rotation axis, independent the first support arm, and is connected at its other end<br>
to the first support arm by a universal joint. The lifting cylinder grips on to the universal<br>
joint between the first support arm and parallel arm. By means of a spring element that is<br>
supported on one side against the first support arm and, on the other side, against the<br>
torsion pipe, the first support arm is coupled with the lifting drive with the provision of a<br>
spring movement in lifting direction.<br>
Finally, another lift loading platform system is known from DE-C-102 05 669, in which<br>
the lifting cylinder grips on to the first support arm by means of an elastic compensation<br>
unit. The elastic compensation unit is supported in a rotate-able manner on the first<br>
support arm against the effect of a spring with the effect, that after lifting the loading<br>
platform up to the height of the truck loading-surface by further load on the lifting<br>
cylinder, the compensation unit gets further moved, against the effect of the spring. This<br>
movement gets transmitted by the torsion pipe to the second support arm.<br>
The task of this invention to is to further simplify a lift loading platform system of the<br>
type mentioned above.<br><br>
DESCRIPTION<br>
This task is fulfilled according to the invention, in that the elastic movement coupling is<br>
formed by its spring unit that is supported on the one side on the first support arm, and on<br>
the other side on the lifting cylinder lever or at the end of the lifting cylinder.<br>
In a preferred design form of the invention the first support arm and the lifting cylinder<br>
lever are supported rotate-able around the common rotation axis, independent of one<br>
another. In another preferred design form, the first support arm is supported rotate-able<br>
to its rotation axis at a radial distance (e.g. approx. 100 mm).<br>
The spring unit ideally has a compression spring, particularly a helical spring or a rubber<br>
suspension (e.g. of polyurethane).<br>
The lifting cylinder lever has two parallel, distanced arms, between which the first<br>
support arm is arranged. In order to avoid that both the arms of the lifting cylinder lever<br>
twist one another, on one arm of the lifting cylinder lever, particularly on the inner side<br>
arm, a connecting unit supporting the torsion profile is fixed, that rests on the other arm.<br>
Further advantageous extensions of the invention form the object of the sub-claims.<br>
One can see further advantages of the invention from the descriptions and the drawings.<br>
Similarly, the above-mentioned features and the features mentioned further below can<br>
find application, individually or severally, in various combinations. The design forms<br>
shown and described should not be taken as the final count, but are meant more as<br>
examples to describe the invention.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
The following are shown:<br>
Fig.l Schematically, a first design form of the lift loading platform system according to<br>
the invention, in which the first support arm and the lifting cylinder lever are<br>
supported rotate-able around a common rotation axis, independent of one another;<br><br>
Fig.2 Schematically, a second design form of the lift loading platform system according<br>
to the invention, in which the first support arm on the lifting cylinder lever is<br>
supported at a radial distance to its rotation axis, in a depiction analogous to<br>
fig. 1;<br>
Fig.3 A side view of the left support mechanism of the lift loading platform system<br>
shown in fig. 2, according to III in fig. 2, with a connecting unit not shown in fig.<br>
2; and<br>
Fig.4 Top view of the left support mechanism of the lift loading platform system<br>
shown in fig. 3.<br>
In the schematically shown lift loading platform system 1 shown in fig. 1, depiction of<br>
the fixing on to the chassis frame has been left out on grounds of better overview. The<br>
system points supporting the platform 2 are A1 and B1, A2 and B2 as well as D1 and D2.<br>
The lift loading platform system 1 has a parallelogram-shaped lifting mechanism, whose<br>
basic elements are two support arms 3 ar d 4 that are supported in the fulcrum points A1<br>
or A2 around the common rotation axis 5 in a swivel-able manner on the vehicle side. A<br>
lifting cylinder lever 6 and a lifting cylinder 7 are arranged below the first support arm 3.<br>
On the vehicle side, the lifting cylinder 7 is supported swivel-able around the fulcrum<br>
point C1 and the lifting cylinder lever 7 at A1 is supported swivel-able around its rotation<br>
axis 5, independent of the first support aim 3. The lifting cylinder 7 grips on to the lifting<br>
cylinder lever 6 at C2 and thus forms a tr angle of forces C1, C2, A1 with it. The force of<br>
the lifting cylinder 7 is introduced at the point C2 into the lifting cylinder lever 6 that<br>
describes a radius movement around its fulcrum point A1.<br>
Transmission of the rotation movement and the forces from the lifting cylinder lever 6 on<br>
to the first support arm 3 takes place through its spring unit 8 acting in between and on to<br>
the second support arm 4 through a relatively long torsion- and bending profile (torsion<br>
pipe) 9. As this additionally has the function of an undercarriage protection, it cannot lie<br><br>
in the region of both the support arms 3, 4 and is therefore fixed rotation-free below them<br>
respectively through connecting units (not shown in fig. 1) to the lifting cylinder lever 6<br>
or to the second support arm 4. On account of the relatively big length of the torsion- and<br>
bending profile 9, for the same load, a greater torsion angle results. Naturally this<br>
deflection of forces has a much greater elasticity and therefore results in a greater elastic<br>
resilience, with the consequence of greater rotation angle of the second support arm 4<br>
around its fulcrum point A2, as against the first support arm 3 around its fulcrum point<br>
A1.<br>
As the torsion pipe 9 is fixed to the lifting cylinder lever 6 and, depending on the load,<br>
goes beyond the rotation angle of the firs: support arm 3, the great torsion angle and the<br>
elasticity of the connecting unit get compensated thereby. In this way, one can achieve<br>
that, as a result, the first and second support arm 3, 4 move synchronously towards one<br>
another.<br>
A parallel cylinder 10 is pivoted on the vehicle side at the point B1 and on the platform 2<br>
at D2 and has the functions like closing ofthe platform etc., that is generally known and<br>
therefore not discussed in details here. Besides, it serves the purpose of parallel guiding,<br>
and for that, is arranged shifted horizontally inwards with respect to the second support<br>
arm 4 and parallel to the second support arm 4. During the lifting and lowering<br>
movement, the parallel cylinder 10 acts as static pressure strut.<br>
The spring unit 8 is formed by a rubber suspension 11 that can be compressed to such an<br>
extent (max. spring path) till a stop stud of the lifting cylinder lever 7 comes to rest<br>
against a stop stud of the first support arm 3.<br>
The lift loading platform system 1' shown in fig. 2 differs from the lift loading platform<br>
system 1, merely in that the first support arm 3' on the lifting cylinder lever 6 is<br>
supported rotate-able at a radial distance (e.g. 100 mm) to its rotating axis 5 in the<br>
fulcrum point A1.<br><br>
After lifting the platform 2 to the height of the truck loading-surface, by applying further<br>
load to the lifting cylinder 7, a further lifting movement of the lifting cylinder lever is<br>
possible, that gets transmitted through the torsion pipe 9 on to the second support arm 4.<br>
This is applicable particularly to the unloaded platform. In this way, one can achieve a<br>
clearance-free transition from the platform 2 to the truck loading-floor, even if the<br>
platform 2 is loaded on one side, partly loaded or completely loaded.<br>
Fig. 3 shows that the torsion pipe 9 is fixed on the lifting cylinder side to the lifting<br>
cylinder lever 6 by means of a connecting unit 12. As shown in fig. 4, the lifting cylinder<br>
lever 6 is formed by two parallel, distanced arms 6a, 6b, between which the first support<br>
arm 3' is arranged. The connecting unit 12 comprises of two connecting plates 13, 14<br>
bolted with one another.<br>
The connecting plate 13 is chamfered twice and has a large window 15, through which<br>
the first support arm 3', both the arms 6a, 6b of the lifting cylinder lever 6 and the lifting<br>
cylinder lever 7 stretch, and an upper strut 16 with which the connecting plate 13 is<br>
supported on both the arms 6a and 6b. The connecting plate 13 is fixed at a distance of<br>
100 mm to the fulcrum point C3 of the lifting cylinder lever 6 by means of a continuous<br>
bolt 17 that goes through both arms 6a, 6b of the lifting cylinder lever 6, and has a<br>
distance (hollow)-pin 18 that distances both the arms 6a, 6b. On this distance pin 18, the<br>
first support arm 3' is supported that resis at its other end on the rubber suspension 11.<br>
The second fastening of the connecting plate 13 is done by a second bolt 19, which<br>
connects only the inner-side arm 6a of the lifting cylinder lever 6 with the connecting<br>
plate 13. This bolt joint is only required so that the connecting unit 12 cannot turn away<br>
upwards in case of external undercarriage protection forces and does not hit against the<br>
lifting cylinder piston rod with its lower region of the window 14. The working forces<br>
that get introduced from the lifting cylinder 7 or its triangular forces through the arms 6a,<br>
6b of the lifting cylinder lever 6 into the connecting unit 12, go exclusively through the<br>
positive (shape-hugging) connection tha both the arms 6a, 6b transmit on to the upper<br>
strut 16 of the connecting unit 12. Without the support of the connecting plate 13 on the<br>
outer-side arm 6b, there is the danger that the entire lifting arm, i.e. support arm 3', arms<br><br>
6a, 6b and the lifting cylinder 7 get twisted under lead due to the one-sided fastening of<br>
the connecting plate 13 on the inner-sided arm 6a.<br>
The connecting plate 14 is fixed to the first connecting plate 13 by means of two bolts 20.<br>
In the connecting plate 14, for one of the bolts, several fastening holes 21 are foreseen on<br>
the radius around the other bolt, in order to be able to shift the second connecting plate 14<br>
and hence the torsion pipe 9 forming the andercarriage protection, to the height desired.<br>
Figures 3 and 4 further show the vehicle-side connecting flange 22, to which both the<br>
arms 6a, 6b of the lifting cylinder lever 6 and the lifting cylinder 7 are hinged.<br><br>
