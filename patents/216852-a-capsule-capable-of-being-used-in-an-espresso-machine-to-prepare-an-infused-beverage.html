				<td>Description<br>
A capsule to be used to prepare an infused beverage<br>
Technical field<br>
The present invention relates to a capsule that can be used<br>
to prepare an infused beverage.<br>
In particular, the present invention relates to a single-<br>
dose coffee capsule to be used in an espresso coffee machine in<br>
which a flow of hot or boilling water forced through the capsule<br>
positioned in a percolating chamber produces a hot milk or coffee<br>
beverage, such as, for example, macchiato espresso coffee or<br>
cappuccino, which the present specification expressly refers to<br>
but without restricting the scope of the invention.<br>
Background Art<br>
Nowadays, a very popular way of preparing espresso coffee,<br>
especially in the home, is to use single-dose "coffee pods", which<br>
are extremely easy to use and readily available on the market.<br>
Typically, in this context, a pod is a single measure of coffee or<br>
other infusion product enclosed in a sealed filter paper container<br>
or bag of substantially cylindrical shape designed to be placed in<br>
a suitable holder forming part of the espresso coffee machine.<br>
European patent EP 776166 El describes the mathod for making<br>
a filter paper bag or pod where the infusion material, namely<br>
coffee, is compressed, mixed with soluble additive material, such<br>
as powdered milk or creamer or the like, and enclosed between two<br>
layers of filter paper. The pod thus obtained can be used in an<br>
espresso coffee machine to make a hot coffee and milk beverage,<br>
espacially cappuccino,<br>
The use of a pod of the type made of filter paper as<br>
described in the aforementioned, patent, has considerable<br>
disadvantages.<br>
The hot water flowing through the filter paper pod dissolves<br><br>
WO 2004/071899	PCT/IB2004/000396<br>
2<br>
all the soluble additive material, namely the powdered milk,<br>
present in the mixture, whilst the infusion material, namely the<br>
coffee, tends to remain compacted. As a result, the beverage made<br>
with pods of this kind often contains incorrect proportions of<br>
milk to toffee. In other terms, the beverage made using the pods<br>
described above, which are trade entirely of filter paper, contains<br>
an excessively high concentration of milk, making it unpleasant to<br>
the taste.<br>
Another disadvantage of these pods made entirely of filter<br>
paper is that the part of the mixture constituted by the soluble<br>
additive material dissolves coupletely, thus partly emptying the<br>
pod, causing it to become soft and spongy, and difficult to remove<br>
from the holder of the coffee machine when an unused pod has to be<br>
placed in the machine to make another cup of coffee.<br>
The present invention has for an aim to provide a capsule<br>
used to prepare an infused coffee and milk beverage that overcomes<br>
the above mentioned disadvantages.<br>
Disclosure of the invention<br>
The present invention accordingly provides a capsule that<br>
can be used to prepare an infixed beverage and that is<br>
characterised in that it comprises a first container made of a<br>
substantially flexible material and containing a powdered infusion<br>
substance, and a second container made of a substantially rigid<br>
material and containing a powdered soluble, substance.<br>
Brief description of the drawings<br>
Tha invention will now be described with reference to the<br>
accompanying drawings which illustrate a preferred, non-<br>
restricting embodiment of a capsule used to prepare an infused<br>
beverage, and in which:<br>
Figure 1 is a front cross section of a preferred embodiment<br>
of the capsule according, to the invention;<br>
Figtjre 2 is a detail, shown in cross section, of the capsule<br>
of Figure 1;<br>
Figure 3 is another front cross section of the capsule of<br>
Figure 1;<br><br>
WO 2004/071899	PCT/IB2004/000396<br>
3<br>
Figure 4 is a perspective view of the capsule according to<br>
the present, invention;<br>
Figure 5 is a front cross section of the capsule of Figure 4<br>
during infusion;  and.<br>
Figure 6 is a detail, shown in cross section, of the capsule<br>
of Figure 5.<br>
Detailed description of the preferred embodiments of the invention<br>
with reference to the accompanying drawings, the numeral 1<br>
denotes a single-dose capeule for use in an espresso coffee<br>
macnine to prepare a hot coffee and milk beverage, especially<br>
cappuccino.<br>
The espresso coffee machine, not illustrated because it is a<br>
very well known type of machine, basically comprises a device for<br>
producing a flow of hot or boiling water that is forced through<br>
the capsule 1 once the latter has been placed in a holder in a<br>
percolating chamber where the hot beverage is brewed.<br>
The capsule 1 comprises a closed container or cartridge 2,<br>
preferably in the shape of truncated cone made of a food safe<br>
plastic material.<br>
As illustrated in Figures 5 and 6, the bottom surface 3 of<br>
the cartridge 2 has a central hole 4, preferably circular, covered<br>
by a seal 5 of suitable material designed to be opened or pierced<br>
by a hollow needle A forming part of the coffee machine, in an<br>
alternative embodiment, the seal 5 forms, an integral part of the<br>
bottom surface 3 of the cartridge 2, that is to say, it<br>
constitutes a portion of the surfaces 3 that can be easily pierced.<br>
The cartridge 2 holds a predetermined guantity at powdered<br>
soluble "material NS comprising powered milk or creamer or the<br>
like. The material MS may also comprise a predetermined quantity<br>
of powdered sugar.<br>
As illustrated in Figures 1 and from 3 to 5, the capsule 1<br>
also comprises a container or pod 6 of filter paper or similar<br>
filter material, containing a tablet of infusion material Ml,<br>
namely coffee powder, and positioned at the top 7 of the cartridge<br>
2.<br>
More   specifically,   as   shown  in   Figures   1,   2,    3   and   5,   the<br><br>
WO 2004/071899	PCT/IB2004/000396<br>
4<br>
outer annular edge 8 of the pod 6 rests on, and is fixed to, a<br>
matching annular protuberance 9 of the cartridge 2, running round<br>
the outer edge at the top 7 of the cartridge 2.<br>
The edge 8 of the pod 6 ia fixed to the annular protuberance<br>
9 of the cartridge 2 preferably by a gluing, heat-sealing or<br>
similar process.<br>
In a still more preferable solution, fixing is accomplished<br>
by the currently known process of ultrasound sealing.<br>
As illustrated, in Figures 2, 3 and 4, the capsule 1 is<br>
advantageously covered and sealed by a sheet 10 of cover material,<br>
such as, for example, aluminium foil or the like, which is applied<br>
to the end of the protuberance 9 of the capsule 1 cartridge 2, for<br>
example by gluing, heat sealing or ultrasound sealing, in such a<br>
way aa to cover the top 11 of the pod 6, thus keeping in the aroma<br>
of the coffee it contains.<br>
The cover 10 is designed to be removed just before the<br>
capsule l is placed by the user in the appropriate holder in the<br>
coffee machine. The user can then start preparing the cappuccino<br>
by pressing the coffee machine start button which causes a<br>
relative movement between the needle A and the capsule 1 such that<br>
the needle A pierces the seal 5 and penetrates the hole in the<br>
capsule 1.<br>
The flow of hot water produced by the machine passes first<br>
through the pod 6, creating a flow of infused coffee Ml which<br>
falls onto and wets the soluble creamer MS inside the cartridge 2<br>
and from there flows through the hollow interior of the needle h<br>
to produce cappuceino that fills an undarlying glass or cup (not<br>
illustrated).<br>
Thus, a delectable cappuccino with an optimum proportion of<br>
milk to coffee, can be prepared every time.<br>
Once used, the capsule 1 can be removed very easily from the<br>
machine, thanks, especially to the closed, rigid structure of the<br>
cartridge 2, Further, when the capsule 1 is moved away from the<br>
needle A, the seal 5 tends to re-close the hole 4, preventing<br>
residual water or beverage from dripping out and dirtying the user<br>
or the area around the machine.<br>
Moreover, it should be stressed, that the capsule 1 disclosed<br><br>
WO 2004/071899	PCT/IB2004/000396<br>
5<br>
herein can be safely handled and sold without any overwapping<br>
thanks to the rigid structure of the cartridge 2 and to the cover<br>
10 attached to the top of it and placed, only over the top face of<br>
the pod 6, This means legs packaging material is required which in<br>
turn means not only considerable savings in tetms of lower<br>
production and selling costs but also a reduced impact on the<br>
environment.<br>
It will be understood that the capsule as described herein can<br>
be modified and adapted in several ways without thereby departing<br>
from the a cope of the inventive concept. Moreover, all the details<br>
of the invention may be substituted by technically equivalent<br>
elements.<br><br>
