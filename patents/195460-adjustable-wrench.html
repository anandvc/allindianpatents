				<td>ADJUSTABLE WRENCH BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The   present  invention   relates  to  hand   tools   and,   more specifically, to an adjustable wrench.<br>
When operating a conventional adjustable wrench 100, as shown in FIG.  1, the user may hold the adjustable wrench 100 in horizontal, and then rotates the adjusting worm 101 with the thumb to move the adjustable jaw 102 to the desired position. In order to let the adjustable jaw 102 be smoothly moved along the slide rails 104 of the fixed jaw (not shown), a clearance c is left between the slide rails 103 of the adjustable jaw 102 and the slide rails 104 of the fixed jaw. However, the moment produced by the weight w of the adjustable jaw 102 forces the adjustable jaw 102 to incline in one direction, thereby causing one slide rail 103 of the adjustable jaw 102 to attach one slide rail 104 of the fixed jaw. When moving the adjustable jaw 102 at this time, the rails 103 and 104 are rubbed against each other, causing an unstable movement of the adjustable jaw   102.   A   conventional   method   of  eliminating   the   aforesaid problem is to reduce the clearance c between the adjustable jaw and the   fixed jaw.   For  example,   ASME   (The  American   Society   of Mechanical Engineers) B107.8M-1996 defines that the clearance of the adjustable jaw must be as low as within 0.3mm~0.47mm. ISO (International  Standard  Organization)  6786-1982(E)  defines  that<br>
2<br><br>
the clearance of the adjustable jaw must be as low as within 0.25 mm ~ 0.36 mm when applying a slight side pressure on the adjustable jaw. The definitions of ISO and ASME do not stop the occurrence of friction between the slide rails of the adjustable jaw and the slide rails of the fixed jaw, i.e. these definitions do not eliminate the aforesaid problem. <br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is one object of the present invention to provide an adjustable wrench, which eliminates friction during movement of the adjustable jaw relative to the fixed jaw.<br>
It is another object of the present invention to provide an adjustable wrench, which prevents the adjustable jaw from trembling in its moving direction when adjusted to the desired position.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides an adjustable wrench comprising :<br>
a frame having a fixed jaw and a track at one end thereof;<br>
an adjusting worm rotatably engaged in said frame;<br>
an adjustable jaw with a neck having a rack disposed at the bottom of a sliding block and meshed with said adjusting worm, wherein said adjustable jaw is moveable in said track relative to said fixed jaw in the event of said adjusting worm being rotated;<br>
a space being formed between each side of said neck and each of opposite walls of said track;<br>
at least one through hole provided in said neck; and<br>
a packing device fixed in said receiving hole and extending through each said space into engagement with each of said opposing walls;<br>
said packing device being a cylindrical elastic member with ends respectively engaged against said opposite walls.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
Referring to FIGS, from 2 through 4, an adjustable wrench<br>
1 in accordance with a first embodiment of the present invention comprises a frame 10, an adjusting worm 21, a worm spring 22, a worm pin 23, an adjustable jaw 30, and two packing devices 41 and 42.<br>
The frame 10 has a handle 11, a fixed jaw 12 at one end of the handle 11, two parallel side rails 15 perpendicularly extended forwards from one side of the fixed jaw 12, a transverse track 13 defined between the rails 15, and an opening 14 disposed below the track 13 and in communication with the track 13. The adjusting worm 21 is pivotally mounted in the opening 14 of the frame 10 by the pivot pin 23. The worm spring 22 is mounted on the pivot pin 23, having one end being against one end of the adjusting worm 21 and the other end being against the frame 10. The adjustable jaw 30 has a bottom neck 31, two through holes 341 and 342 extended through the bottom neck 31, a cylindrical sliding block 32 transversely disposed at the bottom side of the bottom neck 31.<br>
4<br><br><br>
The neck 31  and the sliding block 32 of the adjustable jaw 30 received in the track 13 of the frame 10 for enabling the adjustable jaw 30 to be moved along the traek 13, A rack 33 provided at the bottom side of the sliding block 32 and meshed with the adjusting worm 21 for enabling the adjustable jaw 30 to be moved in the track 13 upon rotating the adjusting worm 21, Two slide rails 35 disposed at two sides of the neck 31 above the adjusting block 32. After insertion of the neck 31 and sliding block 32 of the adjustable jaw 30 into the track 13 of the frame 10, two spaces 131 and 132 are left at two opposite sides of the neck 31 of the adjustable jaw 30 within the track 13 of the frame 10. The packing devices 41 and 42 are elastic rubber rods of length not shorter than the width of the track  13 of the frame  10.  The packing devices 41   and 42 are respectively pressed into the through holes 341  and 342 of the bottom neck 31 of the adjustable jaw 30 with interference fit. Each of the packing devices 41 and 42 have two rounded distal ends respectively suspended in the spaces 131 and 132 and being against the frame 10.<br>
Referring to FIG, 4 again, when the user holds the frame 10 of the adjustable wrench 1 in horizontal and rotates the adjusting worm 21 with the thumb. The packing devices 41 and 42 bear the moment produced by the weight W of the adjustable jaw 30, preventing the rails 35 of the adjustable jaw 30 from contacting<br>
5<br><br><br><br><br>
with the rails 15 of the frame 10. Therefore, no friction is produced between the railsl5 and 35. After long uses, the adjustable jaw 30 can still be moved smoothly and maintained in balance when moving.<br>
Referring to FIGS. 3 and 4 again, because of the adjustable wrench can be used to rotate different sizes of hexagonal (or square) bolts or nuts. A clearance c1 is produced between the rack 33 of the adjustable jaw 30 and the adjusting worm 21. After the adjustable jaw 30 has been adjusted to the desired position, the clearance cl will cause the adjustable jaw 30 to tremble in its moving direction, resulting a variation of the size s between the fixed jaw 12 and the adjustable jaw 30. If the adjustable jaw 30 trembles, interference will be produced when repeatedly turning the workpiece. The adjustable wrench of the present invention can eliminate above problem. This achievement is described hereinafter.<br>
Referring to FIG. 3 again, as stated above, the two distal ends of each of the packing devices 41 and 42 are respectively against the frame 10. After the adjustable jaw 30 has been adjusted to the desired position, a friction force f is produced between the packing devices 41 and 42 and the frame 10. This friction force f can stop the tremble of the adjustable jaw 30 resulted from the clearance cl between the adjusting worm 21 and the rack 33. In general, the  adjustable wrench  1  eliminates friction between the<br>
6<br><br>
rails 15 of the frame 10 and the rails 35 of the adjustable jaw 30, and provides a friction force to secure the adjustable jaw 30 in position after each adjustment.<br>
