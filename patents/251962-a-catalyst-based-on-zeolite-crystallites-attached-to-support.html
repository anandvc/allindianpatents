Title:        Catalyst and method for preparing aromatic caxboxylic acids<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0001]      The present invention relates generally to the field of process<br>
chemistry. More in particular the invention pertains to novel catalysts useful<br>
in the preparation of aromatic carboxylic acids and to a method, for preparing<br>
aromatic carboxylic acids.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002]      Aromatic carboxylic acids, such as benzoic acid, phthalic acid,<br>
terephthalic acid, trimethyl benzoic acids, naphthalene dicarbosylic acids and<br>
the like, are used widely as intermediates in the chemical industry. Aromatic<br>
carboxylic acids are prepared by oxidation of their corresponding alkyl<br>
aromatic compounds (see Suresh, A., "Engineering Aspects of Industrial<br>
Liquid-Phase Air Oxidation of Hydrocarbons," Ind. Eng. Chem., Vol. 39: p.<br>
3958-3997, (2000)). For instance, terephthalic acid is prepared by oxidation of<br>
p-xylene, as shown in the schematic below:<br><br>
[0003]      Terephthalic acid, TPA (1, 4- benzenedicarboxylic acid), is of<br>
commercial interest to the polymer industry because of its use in the<br>
manufacture of saturated polyesters, such as polyethylene terephthalate<br>
(PET), 1, 2-othemediol, and copolymere thereof. Worldwide psoduction of of TPA<br>
and its corresponding dimethyl ester, dimethyl terephthalate, ranked about<br>
25th in tonnage of all chemicals produced in 1992, and about 10th of all organic<br>
chemicals.<br><br>
WO 2006/068471	PCT/NL2005/000876<br>
2<br>
[0004]       As shown in the scheme below, the oxidation of p-xylene is a radical<br>
initiated, step-wise reaction which, produces two main intermediates, p-toluic<br>
acid and 4-formyl-benzoic acid.<br><br>
[0005]      Incomplete oxidation of 4-formyl-benzoic acid (4-CBA) leads to<br>
contamination of TPA purity. Removal of 4-CBA is complicated by the fact<br>
that it co-crystallizes with TPA due to its structural similarity with TPA.<br>
Contamination with 4-CBA can be substantial; for instance, there are<br>
production processes that yield a TPA stock which have approximately 5000<br>
ppm of 4-CBA (Perniconea et al., "An investigation on Pd/C industrial catalysts<br>
for the purification of terephthalic add," Catalysis Today, Vol. 44: p. 129-185<br>
(1998)). Thus, subsequent purification steps after TPA production are often<br>
necessary in order to attain TPA feedstock of sufficient purity for high-grade<br>
polyester synthesis (see Matsuzawa, K. et al., "Technological Development of<br>
Purified Terephthalic Acid," Chemical Economy &amp; Engineering Review, Vol. 8<br>
(9): p. 25-30 (1976)).<br>
[0006]      There are numerous process methods available for manufacturing<br>
TPA, each of which have varying production and purity yields for TPA. Most<br>
of these processes involve oxidation, of p-xylene with an oxygen source e.g. air<br>
or O2 gas, in the presence of liquid phase, homogeneous catalysts containing at<br>
least cobalt and/or manganese metals. In addition, most of these processes are<br>
conducted in the presence of an acidic solvent, such as acetic acid, and as a<br>
rule employ corrosive bromine promoters as a radical source e.g. HBr, NaEr, or<br><br>
WO 2006/068471	PCT/NL2005/000876<br>
3<br>
other metal  bromines.  Thus, these processes are typically conducted in<br>
expensive, titanium-clad reactors that can accommodate such harsh reaction<br>
conditions. Representative methods for manufacturing TPA are described in<br>
the following patents and publications, the disclosures of all of which are<br>
incorporated herein by reference.<br>

encapsulated salen, saltin, and salcyhexen complexes of cobalt or manganese<br>
using t-butyl hydroperoxide as the initiator. This process converts up to 50-<br>
60% of p-xylene; however, the yields of TPA are low and the main product<br>
attained is p-toluic acid.<br>
(00191       Currently, there exists a need for methods of synthesizing aromatic<br>
carboxylic acids with 3t*f3icicnt]y high yields and suitable p*irity fo*<br>
subsequent high-grade manufacturing processes, so as to obviate the need for<br>
additional purification steps. In addition, there exists a need for methods that<br>
avoid the use of corrosive feed materials or other process materials which may<br>
be harmful to the environment, such as acetic acid, NaBr, or HBr.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0020]      The present invention concerns novel solid catalysts, and their use in<br>
the preparation of an aromatic carboxylic acid by oxidation of an alkyl<br>
aromatic compound. The invention also provides a one-step method using such<br>
a catalyst, which circumvents the need for subsequent purification procedures<br>
e.g. hydrogenation, for the preparation of high-grade alfcyl aromatic<br>
cotQpoutJids. Embodiments of the present, mat/hod avoid f.hfl use af nnrrosive<br><br>

inorganic bromine reagents by employing more environmentally sensible<br>
organic bfomated reagents. The novel catalyst itself consists of small<br>
crystallites of the catalytic principle, with a specified narrow size distribution,<br>
which are attached to or encapsulated in a support, more in particular<br>
encapsulated within a tneso-porous, possibly functionally enhanced matrix<br>
material.<br>
The present invention is drawn to a catalytic principle based on zeolite<br>
crystallites attached to support or incorporated in a matrix and a catalytically<br>
active principle incorporated in the zeolite, the*, aaid crystallites having a<br>
diameter of between 20 and 300 nm and said catalytically active principle<br>
having a formula corresponding to:<br>
CoMn2(0)(R-COO)6Liki IA2 wherein:<br>
R is an optionally substituted C1-C4 alkyl;<br>
Ll is tun upliyju&amp;Uly substituted nitrogen containing carboxylic acid<br>
or salts thereof;<br>
L2 is selected from the group consisting of H2O, an optionally<br>
substituted C&amp;-C4 alkyl containing carboxylic acid, an<br>
optionally substituted Cs-C<s cycloalkyl or heterocycle an></s>
optionally substituted C5-C$ heteroaryl or aryl; and<br>
kl + k2 = 3;<br>
wherein the zeolite has an Si/Al atomic ratio of at least 8.<br>
Embodiments include catalysts of the above formula where R is -CH3 or -CzHr&gt;;<br>
where L1 is picolinic acid, nicotinic acid, or iso-nicotinic acid; and where L2 is<br>
CH3OOOH or H2O.<br><br>

7<br>
[0021]       The present invention is also drawn to a catalytic principle having a<br>
formula corresponding to CoMnz(O)(R-COO)6 k3 IAS L4k4f wherein:<br>
R is an optionally substituted C1-C4 aJLkyl;<br>
L3 i« an. optionally substituted nitrogen nontnirnng r.arboxylate;<br>
L4 is selected from the group consisting of IfcO, an optionally<br>
substituted nitrogen containing carboxylic acid, an optionally<br>
substituted CVd alkyl containing carboxyhc acid, an optionally<br>
substituted CG-CG cycloalkyl or heterocycle, and an optionally<br>
substituted Cr,-Ce heteroaryl or aryl;<br>
k3 is 1, 2, or 3; and<br>
k3 + k4=3.<br>
{0022]      Preferred embodiments include catalytic principles of the above<br>
formula where R is -CHs or -C2H1;; where L5 is 1-pyridine-COO, 2-pyridine-<br>
COO-, or 3-pyridin©-COO"; and where 1A is picolinic acid, nicotinic acid, i-<br>
nicotinic acid, CHsCOOH, or H2O .<br>
[0023]      The invention resides therein, that the specific catalytically active<br>
principle is incorporated within the specifically selected zeolite, which zeolite<br>
is preferably characterized in that it has an Si/Al atomic ratio of at least 8.<br>
Preferably the ratio is at most 12. Preferably the size of the channels is such,<br>
that the catalytically active principle is too large to migrate through the<br>
channels. However, the crossings of the channels are sufficiently large to trap<br>
the catalytically active principle. In the invention the said principle is<br>
accordingly synthesized in place, i.e. at said crossings, which is the preferred<br><br>
WO 2006/068471	PCT/NL2005/000876<br>
8<br>
method, although it is also possible that the zeolite is synthesized around the<br>
said complete principle.<br>
[0024]      Suitable channel diameters arc within the range of up to 8 A.<br>
[0025]      The zeolite crystallites are quite small, namely between 20 and 300<br>
nm, With larger crystallites diffusion limitation may occur, resulting in<br>
decrease of activity ajad selectivity, thereby defeating one of the objects of the<br>
inveatioa, n&amp;moly the possibility to produce aromatic earboxylic acids, such as<br>
therephtalic acids without the need to have subsequent purification.<br>
10026]      Another aspect, of the invention resides in the matrix encapsulation,<br>
Thiw matrix supports the crystallites and may have a waseo-potfous structure.<br>
The support or matrix material should preferably have no or limited<br>
functionality in the oxidation reaction, and be such that it does not hinder the<br>
diffusion of reaction components into or out of the crystallites. Suitable matrix<br>
materials include mesoporous silica, carbon, carbon nanotubes and the like,<br>
[0027]      Catalytic principles presented herein have the metal complex hosted<br>
within a possibly functionally enhanced zeolite, which include, but are not<br>
limited to MEI, beta (*BEA), and also including members of the associated<br>
disorder families, such as fibrous and the like, micro-porous structures based<br>
on the above zeolites and mixtures thereof. For a detailed explanation of the<br>
structural similarities among zeolites and a list of references with specific<br>
structural information about zeolites, see, for example, U.S. Patent Nos.<br>

I. INVENTION CATALYSTS<br>
A. PREPARATION OF INVENTION CATALYTIC PRINCIPLE<br>
(00521      The present invention provides novel compositions that have unique<br>
catalytic function by stabilizing a catalytic principle corresponding to<br>
CoMn2(O)(R-COO)6 IAI h\t and CoMn2(O)(K,-COO)e k3 L3k3 L4k4, as described<br>
above, in micro-porous zeolite or as clustered aggregates encapsulated by<br>
specific synthesis within a zeolite composite structure. The catalyst consists of<br>
crystallites of zeolite of appropriate small size embedded in a meso-porous<br>
matrix of inert material or attached to a suitable support.<br><br>

Preferred ejoibodiiaeat3 of metal complex of the catalysts provided herein<br>

NC6H4COO)(l-NCeH4COOH)2 / beta Zeolite with small crystallites 
in a xneso-porous SiC matrix.<br>
[0053]      Various methods for preparing the components for the presented<br>
catalysts are well known to one of skill in the art. For instance, preparative<br>
procedures for synthesizing the catalytic principle of the invention catalyst,<br>
include those described, for example, in Kennet J. et al, ("Applicable Zeolite<br>
Encapsulation Methods Flexible Ligand Method", J. Indus. Phenom., Vol.<br>
21:169-184 (1995)); Vandermade, A. W. et aL (J. Ohem. Soc. Chem, Commun.,<br>
Vol. 1204 (1983)); and Viswanathan et al. (J. Energy Heat and Mass Transfer,<br>
Vol. 8: 281 (1996)). The production of raeso-porous zeolite has been reviewed,	i<br>
for example, in Walter G. Klemperer et al. ('Tailored Porous Materials" Chem.	j<br>
Mater. 1999, 11, 2633-2656).<br>
Alternative preparative procedures may be employed for preparing zeolites for<br>
use with larger Hgands. In instances where the coordinating molecule is large<br>
or too inflexible to penetrate the zeolite, the zeolite can be synthesized around<br>
the already pre-formed p-3-oxo bridged metal coordinated complex by the use of<br>
structure directing molecules. Such procedures are described, for example, in<br>
Mitchell M. et al. (Z. Phys. B, Vol. 97: 353 (1995)); Lobo, R. et al. (J. Inclusion<br>
Phenom. Mol. Recognit. Chem., Vol. 21: 47 (1995)); and Barton, T. J. et al,<br>
("Tailored Porous Materials", Ohem. Mater., Vol. 11: 2633-2656 (1999)). A<br>
recent review may be found, for example, in Martin P. Attfield ("Microporous<br>
materials" Science Progress (2002), 85 (4), 319-345).<br>
[0054]      In addition, the composition of the invention further includes a<br>
zeolite. In preferred embodiments, invention catalysts consist of encapsulated<br>
crystallites of a zeolite catalytic principle. Certain zeolites provide catalytic<br>
principles that may be more optimal for use in the presently claimed methods.<br><br>
WO 2006/068471	PCT/NL2005/00087f,<br>
18<br>
Suitable zeolites for use in the invention have an Si/Al atomic ratio of at least<br>
8. These zeolites are micro-porous materials which comprise pore sixes of up to<br>
8A, and preferably having no zeolite cages.<br>
Preferred zeolites are meso-porous beta zeolite (*BEA) with small, crystallite<br>
size of about 20-200 am but also including members of the associated disorder<br>
families, such as fibrous. Specific embodiments of clustered sites catalysts<br>
provided herein include CoMns(O)(CH3-COO)s (2-NCeH4COOH)s encapsulated<br>
in a beta zeolite which is embedded within a meso-porous S1O2 matrix and<br>
CoMn*(0)(CH*-COO)5 (l-NCe^COOXl-NCsHUCOOH)* hosted in a beta zeolite<br>
supported on meso-porous carbon.<br>
10055J      A representative method for encapsulating the invention catalytic<br>
principle involves creating the "ship-in-bottte" catalytic structure by the<br>
"flexible Hgand method". This well known method involves ligand diffusion<br>
through the poree of an already metal exchanged zeolite. For more detailed<br>
discussion of exemplary preparation methods, see, for example Raja et al.,<br>

principle and allows the preparation of the invention catalyst in several<br><br>

different forms for use in fixed bed, slurry particles^ membranes and other<br>
configurations.<br>
[0058J      The preferred method will depend both on the zeolite component of<br>
the catalytic principle aad the encapsulation matrix material. Preparation<br>
methods may consist of grafting separately prepared zeolites on the inert<br>
matrix material or, alternatively, the composite may be synthesized in situ by<br>
adding the appropriate matrix material to a specific zeolite synthesis gel.<br>
These methods, such as adapted hydrothermal syntheses are generally known<br>
to one skilled in the art. The methodology for synthesis of composites, such as<br>
through the hydrothermal process are discussed, for example, in Oamblor M.<br>

[0060}      The ki-situ synthesis of the metal complex itself may be realized<br>
after the encapsulation of the zeolite in the matrix material. The preferred<br>
method for the preparation of the invention catalysts is to create the catalytic<br>
principle itself in the matrix as a second production step after encapsulation.<br>
II. USE OF INVENTION CATALYSTS<br>
[0061]      Catalysts provided herein can be employed in a variety of synthetic<br>
processes. For instance, invention catalysts can be used in the synthesis of a<br>
variety of organic compounds, such as, but not limited to, aUkyl, alkenyl,<br>

Furthermore, invention catalysts may be used in the stereoselective synthesis<br>
of organic compounds. Moreover, invention catalysts may be utilized in the<br>
preparation of macrocyclie compounds, such as fungicides, antibiotics, natural<br>
product mimetics, and the like.<br>
[00621      Preferably, invention catalysts are used in the oxidation of aikyl<br>
aromatic compounds to produce aromatic caiboxylic acids. Various methods<br>
for oxidizing aikyl aromatic compounds in the presence of a catalyst are well<br>
known to one of skill in the art. Described in the Examples below is a<br>
generalized representative procedure, which can vary within the scope of<br>
routine experimentation and depending on well-known factors, such as seal© of<br>
synthesis,<br>
[0063]      The preparation, of aromatic carboxylic acids can be performed in one<br>
reactor or a series of reactor. The phrase "reactor" refers to any vessel<br>
appropriate for accommodating the oxidation reaction described herein. For<br>
example, oxidation of aikyl aromatic compounds can be performed in a single<br>
layge stirred tank reactor. Alternatively, oxidation of aUkyJ, aromatic<br>
compounds can, be performed in a continuous series of reactors. For instance,<br><br>
WO 2006/068471	PCT/NL2O05/OOO876<br>
21<br>
an oxygen source can. be provided to each reactor in the series, so as to<br>
facilitate highly efficient oxidation of alkyl aromatic compounds. Additionally,<br>
reactor series can be lock adjusted, so as to prevent backflow of materials.<br>
[0064]      Representative reactors which can be used in accordance with<br>
methods provided herein include titatnum-clad and steel reactors.<br>
{0065] The present methods for the preparation of aromatic carboxylic acids<br>
can, be conducted at temperatures ranging from 200 to 250 "C, and at pressures<br>
ranging from 280 to 750 psig.<br>
(0066}      In accordance with methods provided herein, aa alkyl aromatic<br>
compound is provided to at least one reactor, Alkyl aromatic compounds<br>
include aromatic hydrocarbons having at least one oxidi^able substituent<br>
group capable of being oxidized to a corresponding carboxylic acid or the<br>
derivative product. Preferred alkyl aromatic compounds include dieubstituted<br>
benzene materials having any of a variety of eubstituents, such as alkyl,<br>
bydroxyalkyl, aldehyde, carboalkyl groups, and mixtures thereof. More<br>
pjf&amp;ferred aikyi aromatic compounds include para-disubstxtuted benzene<br>
derivatives having alkyl groups as substituents. An especially preferred alkyl<br>
aromatic compound is p-xylene and/or p-toluic acid.<br>
[0067]      Typically, an alkyl aromatic compound is provided to at least one<br>
reactor in, an amount ranging from about 310kg/s to about lQlOkg/a,<br>

the presence of a solvent wherein, the produced aromatic carboxylic acid is<br>
soluble, For example, such solvents include, but are not limited to, p-xylene;<br>
basic solvents such as chloro-benzene, morpholine, esters of carboxylic acids<br>
and the like; carboxylic anhydrides; and acidic solvents, such as acetic acid.<br>
[0069]      Particularly preferred solvents are those which are the same as the<br>
alkyl aromatic compound. For instance, in embodiments drawn to methods for<br><br>
WO 20O6/O6847!	t,	PCT/NL2905/000876<br>
22<br>
preparing TPA, it is preferred that both the solvent and the alkyl aromatic<br>
compound is p-xylene containing from 0 to 18 percent hy weight water. In<br>
other embodiments drawn to methods for preparing TPA, it is preferred to use<br>
a solvent in which, both terephthalic acid and th© intermediate 4-CBA is<br>
soluble. Not wishing to be bound by any particular theory, it is believed that<br>
keeping 4-CBA in solution, further oxidation of 4-CBA is facilitated. As a<br>
consequence, a larger portion of 4-CBA within the reaction medium is<br>
converted to terephthalic acid thereby decreasing the formation of color-<br>
precursors. Moreover, the present process circumvents the need for removing<br>
4-CBA from within the solid product precipitate in the reaction medium and<br>
allows a one-step preparation of TPA.<br>
[0070]      Typically, solvent is provided to at least one reactor at a rate ranging<br>
from about 310 kg/e to 1010 kg/s,<br>

installed in various forms of fixed beds, membranes, packing arrangements,<br>
etc. in each reactor within a series of reactors. The catalytic principle may be<br>
provided alone, or as embedded zeolite crystallites within an inert matrix.<br>
Typically, an invention catalyst is provided to at least one reactor in an<br>

100 weight parts of p-xylene (in matrix encapsulated form). Oxidation of alkyl<br>
aromatic compounds in, the presence of an invention catalyst can occur for a<br>
time period ranging from about 8 to about 20 mm<br>

each reactor within a series of reactors. In addition, the same or a different<br>
halogen containing or releasing agent may be added to each reactor within a<br>
series of reactors. Typically, halogen containing ox releasing agent is provided<br>
to at least one reactor in such an amount that the bromine contents ranges<br>
from about 2 to 4.5 weight parts of bromine per 100 weight parts of p-xylene.<br>
[0073)      In accordance with methods provided herein, an oxygen source is<br>

EXAMPLES<br>
[007S} The following examples are provided to further illustrate aspects of<br>
the invention. These examples are non-limiting and should not be construed<br>
as limiting any aspect of the invention.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
Synthesis of Representative Invention Catalysts<br>
[0O76|      The foilotving exemplary procedure provides a representative method<br>
to prepare invention catalysts. In addition to the procedures described herein,<br>
numerous other procedures may be employed by one skilled in the art to<br>
prepare intermediates for and assembling the invention catalyst, including<br>
those described, for example, in Kennet J. et al. ("Applicable Zeolite<br>
Encapsulation Methods Flexible Lif and Method", J. Indus. Phenom., Vol.<br>
21:159-184 (1995)); Vandermade, A. W. et al, (J. Chem. Soc. Chera. Commun.,<br>
Vol. 1204 (1983)); and Viswanathan et al. (J. Energy Heat and Mass Transfer,<br>
Vol. 8: 281 (1996)). The beta zeolite can be synthesized using a number of<br>
methods such as a dry gel conversion technique described, for example, in P.R.<br>
Hari Prasada Eao et al. (Chem. Comraun. 1441 (1996)) and the modified<br>
aerogel protocol patent (WO 2004/050555).<br>
[0077]      The following example procedure is adapted for synthesis of the<br>
present catalyst from R.L. Wadlinger et al, US Patent 3308069, 1987, The<br>
multi-step preparation uses an in situ synthesis of beta zeolite by<br>
hydrothermai synthesis; the flexible Ugand exchange method is used for<br>
incorporation of small h'gands into zeolites. Step 1 involves the synthesis of an<br>
appropriate beta zeolite and calcinations to remove any organic structure<br>
directing agents to create the catalyst scaffold. In step 2 the zeolite is<br>
encapsulated in a matrix material (SiO2 in the example). Step 3 involves<br>
absorption, of Co(Il) and Mn(II) onto the suitably acidic zeolite. After<br><br>

subsequent ion'exchange with the metals, the resultant metal-loaded -<br>
composite is dried. Step 4 involves coordination of the metal with nitrogen<br>
containing acids and increasing the oxidation, state of the metals by oxygen<br>
addition to prepare the appropriate metal complex of the catalytic principle.<br>
This is followed by drying of the catalyst.<br>

EXAMPLE 2<br>
Exemplary Procedure for Preparation of Representative Aromatic<br>
Carboxylic Acid<br>
(0092]      A preferred embodiment for the production of terephthalic acid is<br>
illustrated in FIG. 1.<br>
[0093]      Invention methods provided the following advantageous properties<br>
due, in part, to the low conversion of para-xylene in the oxidation reactor.<br>
•	The temperature increase of the reaction mixture is sufficient to<br>
dissipate the heat of reaction and thus, there is no need to cool the<br>
oxidation reactor.<br>
•	The oxygen applied to the oxidation reactor is dissolved and does not<br>
form a separate vapor phase.<br>
•	The water produced by the chemical reaction will not form a separate<br>
liquid phase.<br>
•	The terephthalic acid produced by the chemical reactioa will not form a<br>
separate solid phase.<br>
Reactors<br>
[0094]      Oxidation of p-xylene is performed in continuous oxidation reactors,<br>
conceived in such a way to avoid back-mixing, wherein each reactor is fed with<br>
an oxygen source. Reactors containing fiuidized beds with intrinsic recycle of<br>
catalyst, fixed beds with static arrangement of catalyst, or cross flow beds and<br>
membrane reactors may also be used. As exemplified in Figure 1, the<br>
oxidation resctor may be composed of one of several reaction vessels.<br><br>
WO 2006/068471	PCT/NL20O5/0O0R76<br>
31<br>
Qxidatioa JEfeggtjpja..<br>
[0095]      As shown in Figure 1, an oxygen source and p-xylene is fed into the<br>
oxidation reactor. Terephthaiic acid (TPA), produced in the oxidation reaction,<br>
remains soluble in p-xylen© throughout the course of the oxidation reaction.<br>
Thus, the oxidation reaction mixture is essentially a single-phase liquid<br>
mixture. Operating conditions ixx the oxidation, reactor are such that no second<br>
phase will be formed, neither as a vapor, liquid, or solid.<br>
[0096]       Invention catalysis, which remain solid suspended in p-xylene, may<br>
be added to the oxidation reactor in the form of a slurry that leaves the reactor<br>
with the reaction mixture or can be arranged in various forms such as fixed<br>
bed, radial bed, membranes and the like,<br>
{00971      The reaction mixture is de-pressurized over a throttle valve after<br>
leaving the oxidation, reactor.<br>
^■Pjatatio.tu?iJny.e.atipn_C.ataly.s.t<br>
[0098]      The solid invention catalyst used in the oxidation reaction, when<br>
used in a slurry or fluidi^ed bed configuration, is separated (e.g., by a<br>
hydrocyckme) prior to separation of the reaction products from the reaction<br>
mixture. After separation, invention catalysts are rinsed with fresh p-xylene,<br>
recycled dry p-xylene or a combination of such streams in a eountercurrent<br>
wash. Invention catalyst may then be recycled as a slurry back into the<br>
oxidation reactor for continuous oxidation reactions, along with the balance<br>
make-up of p-xylene and the bulk of th© recycled solvent.<br>
[0099]      la embodiments where the catalyst contacts the reaction mixture in<br>
the form of a fixed ox fluidized bed, the catalyst will not leave the oxidation<br>
reactor. As such, separation of the catalyst from the reaction mixture is not<br>
necessary.<br><br>

Pr.es.surizatio.n Decreases<br>
[00100J     During de-pressurization. the reaction mixture will start to boil and<br>
as a result the temperature of both the vapor phase and the liquid phase will<br>
start to decrease. As a result of the boiling, water, gaseous components, and p-<br>
jtylene from the oxidation reactor will vaporize, leaving behind the produced<br>
terephthaiic acid in a solid form.<br>
Removal of Reaction, Impurities<br>
[00101]     As shown in Figure 1, water created by the oxidation reaction is<br>
removed from the remaining solvent stream (containing p-xylene, water and<br>
residual impurities) hy distillation or sequential flashing, during which the<br>
volatile side products axe also removed, Non-volatilee may be removed as a<br>
purge side stream from the bottom of the separation stage, to be processed<br>
separately to remove heavy components and prevent build-up in the reactor.<br>
Crystallization of Terephthaiic Acid<br>
{001021    The catalyst-free main stream is cooled after catalyst separation,<br>
leading to crystallization of terephthaiic acid. Crystals are recovered (e.g., by a<br>
hydrocyclone or filtration) from the solvent and processed fox subsequent use<br>
by countercurrent washing with fresh p-xylene.<br>

washing, etc.) are fed back into the recycle solvent stream to the oxidation<br>
reactor. This recycled solvent may be split in several washing streams (such<br>
as for rinsing the recovered terephthalic acid crystals, the recovered catalyst,<br>
etc.) but these streams of p-xyiene are eventually collected, and fed to the<br>
oxidation reactor directly or to prepare the slurry for the recycled catalyst- To<br>
the combined recycle the make-up for the catalyst and the bromine containing<br>
