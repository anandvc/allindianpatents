Conductor blank for a drum commutator, method for production of<br>
same, and drum commutator<br>
The present invention relates to an annularly closed conductor<br>
blank for a drum commutator, with conductor segments that are<br>
joined to one another via bridging parts, wherein the conductor<br>
segments are provided with terminal projections disposed on one<br>
end face and with inwardly directed anchor ties intended for<br>
anchoring the conductor segments in a support member.<br>
Furthermore, the present invention relates to a method for<br>
producing an annularly closed conductor blank for a drum<br>
commutator, which blank is provided with conductor segments<br>
joined to one another via bridging parts, as well as to a drum<br>
commutator produced using the aforesaid conductor blank.<br>
Depending on how they are produced, drum commutators are divided<br>
into two groups. In a first design (see, for example, DE 1956340,<br>
DE 2140855, US 4598463 A, EP 0247221 Al, EP 0243640 Bl, DE<br>
29609538 Ul, DE 10244006 Al), individual laminations that in<br>
particular can be stamped out of profile strip are processed.<br>
During manufacture of the commutator, the individual laminations<br>
are inserted into a mounting cage, which defines the exact<br>
location of the laminations during production of the support<br>
member in which the laminations are anchored. Drum commutators<br>
produced in this design meet very stringent quality requirements,<br>
but are relatively expensive to produce, and so in general they<br>
are used only in particularly high-performance electrical<br>
products. In a second design, a conductor blank produced from a<br>
metal strip by rolling and comprising conductor segments joined<br><br>
WO 2007/000219	PCT/EP2006/005035<br>
2<br>
to one another via bridging parts is processed. The support<br>
member is injection-molded onto the corresponding annular<br>
conductor blank. After the support member has been cured, the<br>
bridging parts are removed and in this way the conductor segments<br>
are separated from one another. Drum commutators according to<br>
this design are the subject matter of, for example, US 4705977 A,<br>
US 3492519 A, FR 2458156 A3, US 4872255 A, GB 1561460, EP 0019472<br>
A2, DE 1955122, US 4920633 A, DE 4138829 Al, DE 3307312 Al, EP<br>
0007186 Al, DE 10233712 B3, DE 10306516 Al, DE 2328698, EP<br>
0780029 and WO 01/61796 Al. Compared with the first design<br>
mentioned, such drum commutators have much lower production<br>
costs. On the other hand, the drum commutators produced in this<br>
way have heretofore met only moderate quality requirements.<br>
Against the background of the prior art outlined in the<br>
foregoing, the object of the present invention is to provide a<br>
possibility of producing drum commutators according to the second<br>
design mentioned, which commutators are characterized by quality<br>
features that meet stringent requirements despite low production<br>
costs .<br>
To achieve this object, the present invention focuses on the<br>
styling of the conductor blank, especially on the styling<br>
features that are definitively responsible for anchoring the<br>
conductor segments in the support member. According to the<br>
present invention, the object specified in the foregoing can be<br>
achieved in particular by providing, in an annularly closed<br>
conductor blank of the type mentioned hereinabove, first anchor<br><br>
WO 2007/000219	PCT/EP2006/005035<br>
3<br>
tics forming K-shaped anchor-tie pairs and created by splitting<br>
material on the radially inward surface' of the strip in the<br>
region of the conductor segments, and C-shaped second anchor tics<br>
disposed substantially at the end faces and created by inwardly<br>
directed bending back of anchoring projections disposed along the<br>
rim of the strip. Because of the characteristic combination of<br>
d:i Pferonl, specifically shaped and disposed anchor ties provided<br>
according to the present invention, there can be surprisingly<br>
achieved such good anchoring of the conductor segments in the<br>
support member that drum commutators produced inexpensively using<br>
an annularly closed conductor blank also meet quality<br>
requirements that heretofore were achieved only with complex and<br>
expensive drum commutators according to the individual lamination<br>
design. For this purpose the invention utilizes the knowledge<br>
that the deepest possible anchoring of the conductor segments in<br>
the support member is advantageous for the dimensional stability<br>
of the commutator, even under high loads. Such deep anchoring of<br>
the conductor segments in the support member by correspondingly<br>
long first anchor ties of the K-shaped anchor-tie pairs can be<br>
achieved, while implementing the present invention, by providing,<br>
in addition to that K-shaped anchor-tie pair, C-shaped second<br>
anchor ties disposed.substantially at the end faces, and created<br>
by inwardly directed bending back of anchoring projections<br>
disposed along the rim of the strip. It is only by this end-face<br>
anchoring of the conductor segments by means of the C-shaped<br>
second anchor ties that it is possible at all to make the first<br>
anchor ties sufficiently long that deep anchoring of the<br>
conductor segments in the support member is possible therewith.<br><br>
WO 2007/000219	PCT/EP2006/005035<br>
4<br>
This is so because, with increasing length of the first anchor<br>
ties, their root points become increasingly distant from the ends<br>
of the conductor segments, and so, according to the prior art,<br>
the length of the first anchor ties was limited to such a size<br>
that only relatively shallow anchoring of the conductor segments<br>
in the support member was possible if deformation of the<br>
conductor segments was to be prevented effectively. The second<br>
anchor ties provided according to the invention can also be made<br>
correspondingly long for deep, secure anchoring of the conductor<br>
segments in the support member. As a result, and as explained, it<br>
is possible, using inventive conductor blanks, to produce drum<br>
commutators that meet very stringent quality requirements even<br>
under high loads.<br>
The first anchor ties are generally machined out of rib-like<br>
raised projections on the inside surface of the strip. The<br>
corresponding rib-like profiling of the strip can be achieved in<br>
various ways known in themselves.<br>
Specifically, in the case of relatively small drum commutators, a<br>
preferred improvement of the.inventive conductor blank is<br>
characters zed in that the radial distance of the free ends of at<br>
least one of the respective first anchor ties, of each K-shaped<br>
anchor-tie pair from the axis is at most 65% of the radial<br>
distance of the radial outside face of the conductor segments<br>
from the axis, which face - if necessary with allowance for<br>
mechanical post-machining - defines the brush running surface of<br>
the drum commutator.<br><br>
WO 2007/000219	PCT/EP2006/005035<br>
5<br>
Particularly preferably, the corresponding distance is less than<br>
50%. For the second, C-shaped anchor ties also, the radial<br>
distance of the free ends from the axis is preferably at most 65%<br>
and particularly preferably less than 50% of the radial distance<br>
of the radial outside face of the conductor segments from the<br>
a x i s .<br>
According to another preferred improvement of the invention, the<br>
free ends of the second anchor ties in the inventive conductor<br>
blank have a smaller distance to the axis of the conductor blank<br>
than do the first anchor ties. Particularly preferably, each of<br>
the second anchor ties then ends substantially inward of the<br>
adjacent first anchor ties in radial direction. Under certain<br>
prerequisites, however, it may also be favorable if the free ends<br>
of the first anchor ties have a shorter distance to the axis of<br>
the conductor blank than do the second anchor ties, in which case<br>
each of the second anchor ties can end substantially outward of<br>
an adjacent first anchor tie in radial direction.<br>
For typical applications of drum commutators that embody the<br>
present invention, it is favorable if C-shaped second anchor ties<br>
arc provided in the region of both end faces of the conductor<br>
blank. In this case, the advantages explained in the foregoing<br>
arc particularly marked. Ideally, however, the first and second<br>
anchor ties adjacent to the terminal projections then end<br>
somewhat further inward, in radial direction, than do the first<br>
and second anchor ties provided distant from the terminal-<br>
projections and thus project somewhat more deeply into the<br>
support member in corresponding drum commutators. This results in<br><br>
WO 2007/000219	PCT/EP2006/005035<br>
6<br>
optimal anchoring of the conductor segments with minimal use of<br>
material. If a certain loss of quality is tolerated, however, one<br>
of each two second anchor ties may also be omitted, so that<br>
second anchor ties are provided only in the region of one end<br>
face of the conductor blank. From the viewpoint of costs, it is<br>
then most, favorable to dispense with second anchor ties at the<br>
end face of the conductor blank opposite the terminal<br>
projections, since in this case the strip material used for<br>
production of the conductor blank can be made narrower.<br>
Nevertheless, for drum commutators having a large number of<br>
conductor segments, it is recommended that the second anchor ties<br>
be dispensed with on that side on which the terminal projections<br>
arc disposed, especially if relatively small commutator diameters<br>
are to be achieved.<br>
Another preferred improvement of the invention i.s characterized<br>
in that there are provided, at the end face having the terminal<br>
projections, second anchor ties whose root portions are offset<br>
radially inward relative to the root portions of the terminal<br>
projections. It is not merely in regard to secure anchoring of<br>
the conductor segments in the support member of the drum<br>
commutator that this is. favorable. To the contrary, such a radial<br>
offset of the second anchor ties relative to the terminal<br>
projections is also advantageous with regard to a brush running<br>
surface that is ideally cylindrical as possible, since the<br>
inwardly directed bending-back of the anchoring projections along<br>
the rim in order to form the C-shaped second anchor ties at the<br>
end faces after rolling of the strip does not lead in this case<br><br>
WO 2007/000219	PCT/EP2006/005035<br>
7<br>
to noteworthy deformation of the conductor segments at their<br>
outer surface defining the brush running surface. The foregoing<br>
viewpoints can be achieved, for example, if two second anchor<br>
ties disposed in pairs on both sides of the respective terminal<br>
projection and offset relative thereto in circumferential<br>
direction are provided on each conductor segment in the region of<br>
the end face provided with the terminal projections.<br>
Nevertheless, a particularly preferred improvement is<br>
characterized in that precisely one second anchor tie disposed<br>
radially inward under the respective terminal projection is<br>
provided on each conductor segment in the region of the end face<br>
provided with the terminal projections. The corresponding<br>
anchoring projection can be formed in particular by splitting a<br>
common projection that is also used to form the terminal<br>
projections, so that common projections are first provided on the<br>
one end edge of the strip, and are then split to produce the<br>
terminal projections and also the anchoring projections adjacent<br>
thereto, which can be deformed in the same operational step to<br>
obtain the inwardly bent second anchoring ties. Such a design is<br>
favorable in particular for relatively small-dimension<br>
commutators with a large number of commutator segments.<br>
According to yet another preferred improvement of the invention,<br>
the conductor segments are provided, between the first anchor<br>
ties associated with one another in pairs, with an undercut<br>
groove extending in circumferential direction. Such an undercut<br>
groove can contribute, via additional anchoring of the conductor<br>
segments between the two first anchor ties of each K-shaped<br><br>
WO 2007/000219	PCT/EP2006/005035<br>
8<br>
anchor-tie pair, to further reduction of the danger of<br>
deformation of the conductor segments and thus to improved<br>
dimensional stability of the drum commutator, even at high<br>
speeds.<br>
Corresponding to the foregoing explanations, and according to the<br>
present invention, a method for producing an annularly closed<br>
conductor blank for a drum commutator, which blank is provided<br>
with conductor segments joined to one another via bridging parts,<br>
comprises the following steps:<br>
. - providing a plane, pre-profiled metal strip with terminal<br>
projections disposed along the rim and anchoring projections<br>
also disposed along the rim;<br>
roiling the strip;<br>
creating first anchor ties, which respectively form a K-<br>
shaped anchor-tie pair, by splitting material on the<br>
radially inward surface of the strip in the region of the<br>
conductor segments;<br>
inwardly directed bending back of the anchoring projections<br>
along the rim in order to form C-shaped second anchor ties<br>
substantially at the end faces.<br>
The special advantages of this method can be derived directly<br>
from the foregoing explanations of the conductor blank according,<br>
to the present invention. Preferably the said strip will be<br>
rolled before the first anchor ties are formed; this is favorable<br>
with regard to the smallest possible manufacturing expense;<br><br>
WO 2007/000219	PCT/EP2006/005035<br>
9<br>
However, this is not imperative; another option, provided<br>
suitable machines and tools are used for the purpose, is to roll<br>
the strip only after formation of the first anchor ties. Further<br>
preferred improvements of the inventive method can be derived<br>
directly from the foregoing explanations on the conductor blank<br>
according to the present invention.<br>
During application of the present invention, drum, commutators<br>
having a support member made of insulating molding compound and<br>
conductor segments anchored therein are produced by first<br>
injection molding - in a manner known in itself -- a support<br>
member onto an inventive conductor blank explained hereinabove<br>
and, after injection molding of the support member, removing the<br>
bridging parts that at first join the conductor segments to one<br>
another, it is particularly advantageous if second anchor ties<br>
disposed at the end face opposite the terminal projections end<br>
substantially flush with the end face of the support member at<br>
their root end. As regards the importance, explained hereinabove,<br>
of deep anchoring of the conductor segments in the support<br>
member, other preferred improvements of the inventive drum<br>
commutator are characterized in that the radial extent of at<br>
least one first anchor tie of each K-shaped anchor-tie pair<br>
and/or of the second anchor ties is at least 40% of the distance<br>
of the root of the anchor tie in question from the shaft bore of<br>
the support member.<br>
The present invention will be explained in more detail<br><br>
WO 2007/000219	PCT/EP2006/005035<br>
10<br>
hereinafter on the basis of a preferred exemplary embodiment<br>
illustrated in the drawing. This drawing shows, in a (ha]f) axia.l<br>
section, a drum commutator produced using an inventive conductor<br>
blank.<br>
Drum commutator T illustrated in the drawing comprises a support<br>
member 1 formed from insulating molding compound with a shaft<br>
bore 3 disposed concentrically with axis 2 as well as a plurality<br>
of conductor segments 4 anchored in the support member.<br>
Cylindrical outside face 5 of conductor segments 4 represents<br>
brush running surface 6. The individual conductor segments arc<br>
obtained in a manner known in itself from an annular conductor<br>
blank produced from a strip, in which blank the conductor<br>
segments are joined to one another via bridging parts, which are<br>
removed after injection molding of support member 1.<br>
In the annularly closed conductor blank used for production of<br>
the illustrated drum commutator, each conductor segment 4 is<br>
provided with a terminal projection 7 disposed on one end face,<br>
from which projection a terminal hook 8 for the rotor winding is<br>
formed by subsequent bending back, and anchor tics directed<br>
inwardly toward axis 2 and designed for anchoring the conductor<br>
segments in support member 1, namely two first anchor ties 9a, 9b<br>
and two second anchor ties 10a, 10b disposed substantially at the<br>
end faces. The two first anchor ties 9a, 9b, which form a K-<br>
shaped anchor-tie pair, are created by splitting material on the<br>
radially inward surface of the strip in the region of conductor<br>
segments 4; in contrast, the two second anchor ties 10a, 10b,<br><br>
WO 2007/000219	PCT/EP2006/005035<br>
11<br>
which arc substantially C-shaped, are created by inwardly<br>
directed bending back of anchoring projections disposed along the<br>
rim of the strip. In the region of the end face provided with the<br>
respective terminal projection 7, a second anchor tie 10a is<br>
provided on each conductor segment 4, specifically in such a way<br>
that the root portion 11 of second anchor tie 10a is offset<br>
radially inward relative to root portion 12 of terminal<br>
projection 7.<br>
The free ends of second anchor ties 10a and 10b each have a<br>
smaller distance to axis 2 of the conductor blank than do the<br>
ends of the associated first anchor ties 9a and 9b. This second<br>
anchor tie 10a disposed in the region of the end face provided<br>
with terminal projections 7 ends radially inward of associated<br>
first anchor tie 9a; and second anchor tie 10b disposed in the<br>
region of opposite end face 13 ends radially inward of associated<br>
second anchor tie 9b. Second anchor tie 10b disposed on end face<br>
13 of the conductor segment opposite terminal projection 7 ends<br>
substantially flush at its root end with end face 14 of support<br>
member 1.<br>
First anchor tie 9a and second anchor tie 10a adjacent to<br>
terminal projections 7 end slightly further inward in radial<br>
direction than do first and second anchor ties 9b and 10b, which<br>
are provided distant from the terminal projections. The radial<br>
distance of the free end of first anchor tie 9a at the terminal<br>
end from axis 2 is 65% and the radial distance of the free end of<br>
associated second anchor tie 10a from axis 2 is 55% of the radial<br><br>
WO 2007/000219	PCT/EP2006/005035<br>
12<br>
distance of radial outside face 5 of the conductor segment from<br>
axis 2 .<br>
Kach conductor segment 4 is provided between first anchor tics 9a<br>
and 9b associated with one another in pairs with an undercut<br>
groove 15, which extends in circumferential direction and is<br>
filled, with molding compound.<br><br>

question from the shaft bore (3) of the support member (1).<br><br>
In an annularly closed conductor blank for a drum commutator (T), the<br>
conductor segments (4) are joined to one another via bridging parts. These<br>
conductor segments are provided with terminal projections (7) disposed on<br>
one end face and with inwardly directed anchor ties intended for anchoring<br>
the conductor segments in a support member (1). First anchor ties (9a, 9b),<br>
which are created by splitting material on the radially inward surface of the<br>
strip in the region of the conductor segments (4), form K-shaped anchor-tie<br>
pairs. Furthermore, C-shaped second anchor ties (10a, 10b) disposed<br>
substantially at the end faces are created by inwardly directed bending back<br>
of anchoring projections disposed along the rim of the strip.<br></td>
