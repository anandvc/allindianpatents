The present invention relates to a refrigerator oil, particularly a refrigerator oil for use in combination with a hydrofluorocarbon refrigerant, and a process for lubrication of a refrigeration system using the refrigerator oil. More particularly, the present invention relates to a refrigerator oil which can effectively suppress the foaming phenomenon during boiling of the refrigerant dissolved in the refrigerator oil, artd a process for lubrication of a refrigeration system using the refrigerator oil to maintain the excellent performance of a compression-type refrigeration system.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Compression-type refrigerators are generally constituted with a compressor, a condenser, an expansion valve and an evaporator, and has a structure in which a mixed fluid of a refrigerant and a lubricating oil is circulated in the closed system. Heretofore, in the compression-type refrigerators, dichlorofluoromethane (R12), chlorodifluoromethane (R22) or the like has mainly been used as the refrigerant, and various types of mineral oil and synthetic oil have been used as the lubricant.<br>
However,   chlorofluorohydrocarbons,   such   as   R12   and   R22<br><br>
described above, are being more rigorously restricted world-wide because they bring environmental pollution such as the ozonosphere destruction. By this reason, hydrogen-containing Flon compounds [a "Flon compound" means a chlorofluorocarbon, a hydrofluorocarbon, and a hydrochlorofluorocarbon in general] such as hydrofluorocarbons and hydrochlorofluorocarbons are attracting attention as the novel types of refrigerant. The hydrogen-containing fluorocarbons, particularly hydrofluorocarbons, such as 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane (Flon 134a), are preferred as the refrigerant for compression-type refrigerators because they have little possibility of causing the ozonosphere destruction and can replace Flon 12 with little change in the structure of refrigerators which have heretofore been used.<br>
However, when the hydrofluorocarbon refrigerant described above is used, an unfavorable phenomenon that foaming takes place to a great extent during boiling of the refrigerant dissolved in the refrigerator oil occurs. The foaming phenomenon takes place to a greater extent particularly when a mixed refrigerant containing two or more types of hydrofluorocarbon is used. When the foaming phenomenon occurs to a great extent, a large amount of the refrigerator oil flows into the refrigeration system to cause problems that the refrigerating ability is decreased and that the sufficient lubrication is not achieved because of decrease in the amount of the refrigerator oil at the places requiring lubrication. Particularly when a refrigerator of a recent type equipped with an inverter is used, the problems are greater because a higher speed of rotation is required at the start of the operation.   Therefore, a<br><br>
reingeraior on wnicn can prevent tne toaming phenomenon is required more for a refrigerator of this type than for refrigerators of previous types.<br>
The same phenomenon has also been observed with refrigerants of previous types. It has empirically been known that the foaming phenomenon in the refrigerants of previous types can be suppressed by adding a conventional silicone oil. However, it is the current situation that, when a hydrofluorocarbon refrigerant is used, the addition of a conventional silicone shows such limited effect of suppressing the foaming phenomenon that no practical effect can be expected.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF Tim INVENTION<br>
An object of the present, invention is to provide a refrigerator oil, particularly a refrigerator oil for use in combination with a hydrofluorocarbon refrigerant, which can effectively suppress the foaming phenomenon during boiling of the refrigerant dissolved in the refrigerator oil.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a process for lubrication of a refrigeration system using the above refrigerator oil to maintain the excellent performance of a compression-type refrigeration system.<br>
The present inventors studied extensively to achieve the objects described above. As the result of such studies, it was discovered that, when a fluorinated silicone oil is added to a specific refrigerator oil, the foaming phenomenon during boiling of a refrigerant dissolved in the<br><br>
refrigerator oil can effectively be suppressed. It was also discovered that, in a compression-type refrigeration system, the excellent performance of the refrigeration system can be maintained by lubricating the refrigeration system with the refrigerator oil containing the fluorinated silicone oil described above. The present invention has been completed on the basis of the discoveries.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a refrigerator oil comprising a base oil composed of an oxygen-containing organic compound and a fluorinated silicone oil having a kinematic viscosity of 500 inm2/5«e or more at 25°C. The present invention also provides a process for lubrication of a refrigeration system comprising lubricating a eofinpTession-tYpe refrigeratioTi system by using the refrigerator oil described above.<br>
THE MOST PREFERRED EMBODIMENT TO CARRY OUT THE INVENTION<br>
In the present invention, the fluorinated silicone oil contained in the refrigerator oil has a kinematic viscosity of 500 mm2/sec or more at 25°C. For example, a fluorinated silicone oil having the structure represented by the general formula (I):<br><br>
is preferably used.<br><br>
In the general formula (I), R1 to R6 represent each hydrogen atom, a hydrocarbon group, or a fluorinated hydrocarbon group, and may be the same with each other or different from each other. R7 and R8 represent each a hydrocarbon group or a fluorinated hydrocarbon group, and at least one of R7 and R8 is a fluorinated hydrocarbon. Examples of the hydrocarbon group represented by R1 to R8 include alkyl groups having 1 to 20 carbon atoms, cycloalkyl groups having 5 to 20 carbon atoms, aryl groups having 6 to 20 carbon atoms, and aralkyl groups having 7 to 20 carbon atoms. Examples of the fluorinated hydrocarbon group include fluorinated alkyl groups having 1 to 20 carbon atoms, fluorinated cycloalkyl groups having 5 to 20 carbon atoms, fluorinated aryl groups having 6 to 20 carbon atoms, and fluorinated aralkyl groups having 7 to 20 carbon atoms. Particularly, alkyl groups having 1 to 20 carbon atoms and fluorinated alkyl groups having 1 to 20 carbon atoms are preferable as the hydrocarbon group and the fluorinated hydrocarbon group, respectively, -because the solubility in the refrigerator oil is low and the effect of suppressing the foaming phenomenon is great.<br>
R7 and R8 in a plurality of repeating units may be the same with each other or different from each other, n represents an integer which is selected in such a manner that the fluorinated silicon oil has a kinematic viscosity of 500 mm2/sec or more at 25°C.<br>
The alkyl group having 1 to 20 carbon atoms described above may be linear or branched. Specific examples of the alkyl group having 1 to 20 carbon atoms include methyl group, ethyl group, n-propyl group, isopropyl group, n-butyl group, isobutyl group, sec-butyl group, t-butyl<br><br>
group, various types of pentyl group, various types of hexyl group, various types of octyl group, various types of decyl group, and various types of dodecyl group. Examples of the cycloalkyl group having 5 to 20 carbon atoms include cyclopentyl group, cyclohexyl group, and methylcyclohexyl group. Examples of the aryl group having 6 to 20 carbon atoms include phenyl group, tolyl group, xylyl group, and naphthyl group. Examples of the aralkyl group having 7 to 20 carbon atoms include benzyl group, phenetyl group, and naphthylmethyl group. Examples of the fluorinated alkyl group having 1 to 20 carbon atoms, the fluorinated cycloalkyl groups having 5 to 20 carbon atoms, the fiuormated aryl groups having 6 to 20 carbon atoms, and the fiuoTmated araikyl group having 7 to 20 carbon atoms iadbsfce groups obtained by substituting one or more hydrogen atoms in the alkyl groups, the cycloalkyl groups, the aryl groups, and the aralkyl groups, respectively, described above with fluorine atoms.<br>
When the fluorinated silicone oil represented by the general formula (I) has a kinematic viscosity of less than 500 mm2/sec at 25 °C, the effect of suppressing the foaming phenomenon is insufficient, and the fluorinated silicone oil is not preferable. For exhibiting a sufficient effect of suppressing the foaming phenomenon, the kinematic viscosity at 25°C is preferably 1,000 mm2/sec or more, more preferably 9,000 mm2/sec or more (n is generally more than 100).<br>
The content of the fluorinated silicone oil is not particularly limited. When a hydrofluorocarbon refrigerant is used as the refrigerant, the content is preferably in the range that the compatibility<br><br>
of the refrigerator oil and the refrigerant is not adversely affected. More specifically, the content is preferably in the range of 1 to 6,000 ppm by weight, more preferably in the range of 10 to 3,000 ppm by weight. When the content is less than 1 ppm by weight, the effect of suppressing the foaming phenomenon is sometimes not sufficiently exhibited. When the content is more than 6,000 ppm by weight, the refrigerator oil occasionally becomes cloudy. In view of the effect of suppressing the foaming phenomenon and the stability, it is preferred that the fluorinated silicone oil is contained in such an amount that the product of the kinematic viscosity Cmm2/sec) of the fluorinated silicone oil at 25°C and the content (ppm by weight) of the fluorinated silicone oil in the refrigerator oil is in the range of 50,000 to 3,000,000, more preferably in the range of 100,000 to 2,000,000. When the product is less than 50,000, the effect of suppressing the foaming phenomenon tends to become small. When the product is more than 3,000,000, there is the possibility that the refrigerator oil becomes cloudy.<br>
The refrigerator oil of the present invention is used in combination with various types of refrigerant, preferably in combination with a hydrofluorocarbon refrigerant. When a hydrofluorocarbon refrigerant is used as the refrigerant, the base oil of the refrigerator oil is not particularly limited as long as the base oil has a good compatibility with the hydrofluorocarbon refrigerant. Specifically, oxygen-containing organic compounds are preferable as the base oil because of the good compatibility with hydrofluorocarbon refrigerants.<br>
Examples of the oxygen-containing organic compound include (1)<br><br>
polyalkylene glycols, (2) polyesters, (3) polyol esters, (4) polyether ketones, (5) polyvinyl ethers, and (6) carbonate derivatives.<br>

(wherein R9 represents hydrogen atom, an alkyl group having 1 to 10 carbon atoms, an acyl group having 2 to 10 carbon atoms, or an aliphatic hydrocarbon group having 1 to 10 carbon atoms and 2 to 6 parts for bonding; R10 represents an alkylene group having 2 to 4 carbon atoms; R11 represents hydrogen atom, an alkyl group having 1 to 10 carbon atoms, or an acyl group having 2 to 10 carbon atoms; k represents an integer of I to 6; and m represents a number which is selected in such a manner that the average of mxk is 6 to 80) can be used.<br>
In the above general formula (II), the alkyl group represented by R9 and R11 may be linear, branched linear, or cyclic. Specific examples of the alkyl group include methyl group, ethyl group, n-propyl group, isopropyl group, various types of butyl group, various types of pentyl group, various types of hexyl group, various types of heptyl group, various types of octyl group, various types of nonyl group, various types of decyl group, cyclopentyl group, and cyclohexyl group. When the number of carbon atom in the alkyl group is more than 10, the compatibility with hydrofluorocarbon refrigerants is decreased, and phase separation occasionally takes place. The preferable number of carbon atom in the alkyl group is 1 to 6.<br>
The alkyl group in the acyl group represented by R9 and R11 may<br><br>
be linear, branched linear, or cyclic. Specific examples of the alkyl group include alkyl groups having 1 to 9 carbon atoms selected from the alkyl groups described as the examples of the alkyl group in the above. When the number of carbon atom in the acyl group is more than 10, the compatibility with hydrofluorocarbon refrigerants is decreased, and phase separation occasionally takes place. The preferable number of carbon atom in the alkyl group is 2 to 6.<br>
When R9 and R11 are both alkyl groups or acyl groups, R9 and R11 may be the same or different.<br>
When k is 2 or more, the plurality of R11 in one molecule may be the same with each other or different from each other.<br>
When R3 is an aBc&amp;atie hydrocarbon group having 1 to 10 carbon atoms and 2 to 6 parts for bonding, the aliphatic hydrocarbon group may be an open-chain group or a cyclic group. Examples of the aliphatic hydrocarbon group having 2 parts for bonding include ethylene groupr' propylene group, butylene group, pentylene group, hexylene group, heptylene group, octylene group, nonylene group, decylene group, cyclopentylene group, and cyclohexylene group. Examples of the aliphatic hydrocarbon group having 3 to 6 parts for bonding include residue groups formed by eliminating hydroxyl groups from polyhydric alcohols, such as trimethylpropane, glycerol, pentaerythritol, sorbitol, 1,2,3-trihydroxycylohexane, and 1,3,5-trihydroxycyclohexane.<br>
When the number of carbon atom in the aliphatic hydrocarbon group is more than 10, the compatibility with hydrofluorocarbon refrigerants is decreased, and phase separation occasionally takes place.<br><br>
The preferable number of carbon atom in the alkyl group is 2 to 6.<br>
R10 in the above general formula (II) represents an alkylene group having 2 to 4 carbon atoms. Examples of the oxyalkylene group as the repeating unit include oxyethylene group, oxypropylene group, and oxybutylene group. A single type of the oxyalkylene group or 2 or more types of the oxyalkylene group may be contained in one molecule. It is preferred that at least the oxypropylene unit is contained in one molecule. It is particularly preferred that 50 % by mol or more of the oxypropylene unit is contained in the oxyalkylene unit.<br>
k in the above general formula (II) represents an integer of 1 to 6 which is determined in accordance with the number of the part for bonding in R9. For example, when R9 represents an alkyl group or an acyl group, k represents 1. When R^ represents an aliphatic hydrocarbon group having 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 parts for bonding, k represents 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6, respectively, m represents a number which is selected in such a manner that the average of mxk is 6 to 80, preferably 10 to 70. When the average of mxk is at the outside of the above range, the objects of the present invention cannot sufficiently be achieved.<br>
The polyalkylene glycol represented by the general formula (II) include polyalkylene glycols having hydroxyl groups at the end. When the content of the hydroxyl group at the end is 50 % by mol or less of the total end groups, the polyalkylene glycol containing the hydroxyl group at the end can advantageously be used. However, when the content of the hydroxyl group at the end is more than 50 % by mol, the polyalkylene glycol is not preferable because the polyalkylene glycol becomes more<br><br>
hygroscopic and the viscosity index is decreased.<br>
As the polyalkylene glycol described above, polyoxypropylene glycol dimethyl ethers represented by the general formula:<br><br>
(wherein x represents a number of 6 to 80), polyoxyethylene polyoxypropylene glycol dimethyl ethers represented by the general formula:<br><br>

The aliphatic polyester derivative represented by the above general formula (III) preferably has a molecular weight (measured by the gel permeation chromatography (GPQ) of 300 to 2,000. When the molecular weight is less than 300, the kinematic viscosity is smaller than the desirable range. When the molecular weight is more than 2,000, the aliphatic polyester derivative becomes waxy. Therefore, a molecular weight at the outside of the specified range is not preferable.<br>

Two or more types of refrigerant other than the hydrofluorocarbon refrigerants can also be selected suitably and used in combination-<br>
To the refrigerator oil of the present invention, various conventional additives, such as extreme pressure agents such as phosphoric acid esters and phosphorous acid esters, phenol antioxidants, amine antioxidants, stabilizers such as phenyl glycidyl ether, cyclohexene oxide, epoxidized soy bean oil, and other epoxy compounds, and inactivating agents for copper such as benzotriazole and derivatives of benzotriazole, can suitably be added if necessary.<br>
The present invention also provides a process for lubrication of a refrigeration system in which the lubrication is achieved by using the refrigerator oil containing the fluorinated silicone oil described above in a compression-type refrigeration system, particularly in a compression type refrigeration system using a hydrofluorocarbon refrigerant. In accordance with the above process, the foaming phenomenon occurring during boiling of the refrigerant dissolved in the refrigerator oil can be suppressed to prevent flowing out of a large amount of the refrigerator oil<br><br>
into the system, and the excellent performance of the refrigeration system can be maintained.<br>
Accordingly the present invention relates to a refrigerator oil comprising a base oil consisting of an oxygen containing organic compound and a fluorinated silicone oil having a kinematic viscosity of 500 mm2/sec or more at 25°C, wherein the oxygen containing organic compound is polyalkylene' glycol, a polyester, a polyol ester, a polyether ketone, a polyvinyl ether, or a carbonate derivative and wherein the content of the fluorinated silicone oil in the refrigerator oil is 1 to 6,000 ppm by weight.<br><br>
The present invention is described in more detail with reference to examples.     However,  the present invention is not limited by the examples. Example 1 to 30 and Comparative Examples 1 to 18<br>
Into a pressure resistant glass vessel having an inner diameter of 55 mm and a height of 30 cm, a refrigerator oil and a refrigerant shown in Table 1 in an amounts of 75 ml each were placed. While the mixture was stirred well (1380 rpm) with a propeller at a room temperature under an equilibrium pressure of the refrigerant, the pressure inside of the vessel was rapidly reduced to an atmospheric pressure. The height of the foam formed by the reduction in the pressure was measured. The result was evaluated in accordance with the following criterion. Criterion for evaluation of the result<br>
®:      The height of foam was 5 cm or less.<br>
