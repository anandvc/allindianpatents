				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>This invention relates to a driving device for the Braille transcription of Indian language texts •for blind education.<br>
Written communications with blind persons in their mother tongue is presently totally in a manual mode. The present manual method is very slow and each page of document must, be thoroughly proof--read and the errors, are to be manually corrected. The1 result is even the minimum transcribed material cannot, be provided to the blind provided to the blind students. Another great disadvantage is that, many blind education societies aiming to teach blinds modern technologies like computers have prescribed their knowledge of English as an essential qualification for admission to much coursies. This is mast prohibitive in view of the -fact that majority of blind person are unable to afford such costs and know only their mother tongue -for verbal communication.<br>
An object of this invention is to propose? a driving device for the Braille transcription of Indian language texts for blind educations.<br>
Another object of this invention is to propose a driving device for the Braille transcription<br>
of Indian language texts for blind education and which ability to transcribe English text in both uncontracted and contracted Braille forms.<br>
Still another object of this invention is to propose a driving device for the Braille transcription of Indian language texts for blind educations and capable of producing output, on paper (for small number of copies) and metallic sheets (for large to very large number of copies).<br>
Yet another object of this invention is to propose a driving device for the Braille transcription of Indian language texts for blind educations which has the ability to read inputs directly from printed English text,<br>
A further object of this invention is to propose a driving device for the Braille transcription of Indian language texts for blind educations which has ability to obtain information from other computers on-1 i ne.<br>
A still further object of this invention is to propose a driving device for the Braille transcription of Indian language texts for blind educations which baa ability to store and edit information directly in the Braille form.<br>
According to this invention there is provided a driving device for the braille transcription of the Indian language comprising a micro processor controller adapted to be connected to the personal computer, electromagnetic drivers unit connected to the output terminal of said controller being connected to a perkirts brailler, another elertromagnetic driver, unit connected to the said output o-f the microprocessor controller being connected to the braille process provided for printing the text, in the braille format.<br>
The device of the present invention is a computerised system built around an ordinary personal computer <pc-at> . The invention relates- to the PC-AT compatible driving device for Perkins Brailler and Marburg Stereotyper -for Braille trnascription of texts in any constitutionally recognised Indian languages ass well as English as an aid for blind education. It automates Braille translation by eliminating the need to have specialised knowledge of Braille code and Braille? translation procedure on the part of the operator. Any ordinary user can type in a text using a normal typewriter -like computer keyboard and with the help o-f a special software developed for the purposes, the text<br>
gets converted into the equivalent Grade II contracted Braille -form, which is the standard followed world-wide to teach visually handicapped students at the (secondary level of education. Languages such as Bengali, Assamese, Manipuri arid Oriya ran all be transcribed in this manner. Devnagari scripts can also be similarly transcribed into Braille. The same keyboard of the computer system is used to enter text in any of these languages. The mapping of the English keyboard for these Indian languages is available as separate charts.<br>
In accordance with this invention the driving device has a microprocessor controller adapted to be connected with a personal computer. Electromagnetic drivers unit is connected with the output, of the microprocessor controller. The outputs of the drivers unit are connected to the parkins brailler. Another unit of electromagnetic drivers is connected to the said output of the microprocessor controller so as to actuate the braille press connected therewith.<br>
As a basic unit, this system uses a normal Personal Computer (PC) with keyboard, two serial &amp; one parallel parts the standard inter-face controller cards including a GIST card or equivalent Indian language S/W preloaded or the system, and art inter-face card developed presently.<br>
The add in device of the following invention using above? PC are as follows:<br>
i)        Perkins Bred Her  modified  mechanism for direct actuation by computer.<br>
ii)    A  microprocessor  based  interface  between  the Perkins  Brail1er and the Personal Computer end in  case of    Marburg   Stereotyper   corresponding    Interface, Control1er.<br>
The driving device for the braille transcription according to a preferred embodiment is herein described and illustrated in the accompanying drawings whereins<br>
Fig.l      shows  the block  diagram  of  the driving device.<br>
Referring to the drawing the driving device has a microprocessor controller i adapted to be connected with a personal computer <p.c>-2 through e* RS 232. C interface. The output, of the controller 1 is connected to a electromagnetic drivers unit-3. The outputs of the drivers unit. 3 are connected to the perkins brai11er 4. Another electromagnetic driver unit 5 is connected to the said output of the microprocessor controller 1. The output, terminals of the drivers unit. 5 are connected to the braille press 6 provided to print the text.<br>
The matter to be converted into the braille from when entered into the PC is stored in the disk as a data -file of ASCII characters for English text and ISCII characters codes; for texts in other Indian languages. The system first queries the operator and accepts his Ste-reotyper input such as the tissue of the input data store, the language to be converted from, the grade to be converted into, margine-setting a information, page length and whether printout. is required in Braille form or on Marburg Stereotyper.<br>
The presently modified set-up with said devices and the PC converts the text on a line by line basis. After a line of Braille output is produced, it is displayed in Braille form on the Computer Screen. Simultaneously the line is transmitted serially over RS-232C interface to the microcontroller of the Braille output: device which may either to be a Per kin Brailler or a Marburg Ste-reotyper machine as mentioned above.<br>
The  microcontroller receives the information about  the each Braille character for a  complete  line. The  transmission  and reception over  the  serial  line? takes  place following a strict handshaking protocol  to ensure  that all the information  regarding dots  to  be<br>
embossed  ere properly received  by the  microcontroller and  also  that  synchronization  between  the  PC,  the microcontroller and the speed of embossing as dirated by the  mechanical  structure  of  the  output  device   is correctly  maintained.  After sending a line of  Braille output    information,   the   PC   waits   until    the microcontroller  sends  an "embossing  complete"  signal marking  the  end o-f printing o-f the  current  line   o-f Braille.   Only after receiving this  completion  signal does the PC send the next line of information.<br>
After the completion of printing of the specified number of lines per page, a blank page is displayed on the screen and then the user replaces the printed page with a fresh blank page and presses a key on the computer keyboard to print next page and so on.<br>
For the Marburg Ste-reotyper the "page" actually means metallic: sheets. Instead of manual removal of page as done in the Perkins Brailler, the PC emits an "eject" signal to the controller of the stereotyper which has built-in mechanism to eject the page on receiving this signal.<br>
Perkins Brail1er is a mechanical typewriterlike device with six keys, a short space bar, a linefeed mechanism and a back—space lever for error<br>
correction. The electrical version of the considerably reduces the mechanical pressure necessary to depress the keys and is particularly suitable for visually handicapped people of old and tender age- The actuating mechanism bass been changed by the connected the selecting levers For the dots to be embossed to electromechanical relays which through electronic driver circuits have been connected to the controller interface cards. Once the selection process is completed by activating the proper driver circuits the computer actuates the electrical relay on the Perkins* Brailler to complete the embossing process.<br>
The Marburg Stereotyper is an electrically activated machine for manual operation with the help of press-button switches. Depending on the key combination pressed, the embossing heads imprint. the required Braille dots on a metal foil. At the end of a line the embossing head is brought to lower—most portion of a new line before further embossing begins. The time taken for the head to go back to the beginning of the next, line depends on the distance it had covered during the embossing of the previous line and is controlled manually be keeping the carriage-return switch pressed for the required length of time. At the? end of embossing a complete page, the metal sheet can be ejected by pressing a special eject button. The-inter-face controller in present, system with the computer system mi mimics) this entire manual operation by suitably operating the manual switches. The controller also provide® the variable times  required to bring the embossing head to the beginning of the new line and the election of the sheet at the end of page.<br><br><br><br><br>
