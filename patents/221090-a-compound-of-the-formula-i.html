The compounds of the invention have been the k subject of experiments which have demonstrated their therapeutic properties.<br>
Thus they have been studied as to their <br>
5  affinity with respect to nicotinic receptors containing the a4 β2 subunit according to the methods described by Anderson and Arneric, Eur.   J.   Pharmacol   (1994) 253 261, and by Hall et al., Brain Res.   (1993) 600 127. 150 to 200 g male Sprague Dawley rats are decapitated <br>
10	and all of the brain is rapidly removed, homogenized in 15 volumes of a 0.32 M sucrose solution at 4°C and then centrifuged at 1000 g for 10 min. The pellet is discarded, and the supernatant is centrifuged at 20,000 g for 20 min at 4°C. The pellet is recovered and <br>
15	homogenized with the aid of a Polytron™ mill in 15 volumes of double-distilled water at 4°C, and then centrifuged at 8000 g for 20 min. The pellet is discarded and the supernatant and the "buffy coat" are centrifuged at 40,000 g for 20 min, the pellet is <br>
20    recovered, resuspended in 15 ml of double-distilled water at 4°C and centrifuged once more  at 40,000  g before storing it at -80°C.<br>
  On the day of the experiment, the tissue is slowly thawed and suspended in 3 volumes of buffer. 150 μl of <br>
25   this membrane suspension are incubated at 4°C for<br>
120 min in the presence of 100 μl of 1 nM [3H]cytisine in a final volume of 500 μl  of buffer, in the presence or absence-of compound to be tested. The reaction is stopped by filtration on Whatman GF/B™ filters<br>
20<br><br>
previously treated with polyethyleneimine, the filters are rinsed with two times 5 ml of buffer at 4°C, and the radioactivity retained on the filter is measured by liquid scintigraphy. The non-specific binding is <br>
5  determined in the presence of 10 μM   (-)-nicotine; the non-specific binding represents 75 to 85% of the total binding recovered on the filter. For each concentration of compound studied, the percentage of inhibition of the specific binding of [3H]cytisine is determined, <br>
10  then the IC50, the concentration of compound which inhibits 50% of the specific binding, is calculated. The IC50 values of the most active compounds of the invention are between 0.08 and 1 UM.<br>
The compounds of the invention have also been <br>
15      studied as regards their affinity with respect to nicotinic receptors containing the a7 subunit, according to the methods described by Marks and Collins, J.   Pharmacol.   Exp.   Ther.    (1982) 22 554 and Marks et al. , Mol.   Pharmacol.    (1986) 30 "427. <br>
20	150 to 200 g male OFA rats are decapitated/ all of the brain is rapidly removed, homogenized with the aid of a Polytron™ mill in 15 volumes of a 0.32 M sucrose solution at 4°C, then centrifuged at 1000 g for 10 min. The pellet is discarded, and the supernatant is <br>
25  centrifuged at 8000 g for 20 min at 4°C. The pellet is recovered and homogenized with the aid of a Polytron™ mill in 15 volumes of double-distilled water at 4°C, then centrifuged at 8000 g for 20 min. The pellet is discarded and the supernatant and the "buffy coat" are<br>

centrifuged at 40,000 g for 20 min. The pellet is recovered, resuspended with 15 volumes of double-distilled water at 4°C and centrifuged once more at 40,000 g for 20 min before storing it at -80°C. <br>
5	On the day of the experiment, the tissue is slowly thawed and suspended in 5 volumes of buffer. 150 μl of this membrane suspension are preincubated at 37°C for 30 min, in the dark, in the presence or absence of the compound to be tested. The membranes are then incubated <br>
10	for 60 min at 37°C, in the dark, in the presence of 50 μl of 1 nM [3H]a-bungarotoxin in a final volume of 250 Hi of 20 mM HEPES buffer with 0.05% of polyethyleneimine. The reaction is stopped by filtration on Whatman GF/C™ filters previously treated <br>
l5  for 3 hours with 0.5% polyethyleneimine. The filters are rinsed with two times 5 ml of buffer at 4°C, and the radioactivity retained on each filter is measured by liquid scintigraphy. The non-specific binding is determined in the presence of a-bungarotoxin at l μM <br>
20	final concentration; the non-specific binding    <br>
    represents approximately 60% of the total binding recovered on the filter. For each concentration of compound studied, the percentage of inhibition of the specific binding of [3H]a-bungarotoxin is determined, <br>
25   then the IC50, the concentration of compound which<br>
inhibits 50% of the specific binding, is calculated.<br>
The IC50 values of the compounds of the invention are<br>
between 1 and 20 μM.<br>
22<br><br>
The compounds of the invention have likewise been studied as regards their affinity with respect to peripheral nicotinic receptors of ganglionic type according to the method described by Houghtling et al.,<br>
5   Mol.   Pharmacol.   (1995) 48 280-287.<br>
The capacity of a compound to displace [3H]-epibatidine from bovine adrenal gland membranes measures its affinity for this receptor.<br>
     Bovine adrenal glands stored at -80°C are thawed and<br>
10	homogenized with the aid of a Polytron™ mill in 20 volumes of 50 mM Tris HCl buffer at pH 7.4 at 4°C, then they are centrifuged at 3 5,000 g for 10 min. The supernatant is discarded and the pellet is resuspended in 30 volumes of 50 mM Tris HCl buffer at 4°C and <br>
15	 rehomogenized before recentrifuging at 35,000 g for 10 min. The final pellet is taken up in 10 volumes of Tris HCl buffer at 4°C. 100 ul of membrane or 10 mg of fresh tissue are incubated at 24°C for 3 h in the presence of 50 μl of 0."66 nM [3H]-epibatidine in a final <br>
20	 volume of 250 μl of buffer, in the presence or absence of compound to be tested. The reaction is stopped by dilution of the samples with 50 μM Tris HCl buffer pH 7.4 at 4°C and then these are filtered on Whatman GF/C™ filters previously treated for 3 hours with 0.5% <br>
25  polyethyleneimine. The filters are rinsed two times with 5 ml of buffer and the radioactivity retained on  the filter is measured by liquid scintigraphy. The nonspecific binding is determined in the presence of (-)nicotine at 2 mM final concentration; the non-.<br>
23 <br>
   specific binding represents 30 to 40% of the total binding recovered on the filter. For each concentration of compound studied, the percentage of inhibition of the specific binding of [3H]-epibatidine is determined, <br>
5  then the IC50, the concentration of compound which inhibits 50% of the specific binding, is calculated. The IC50 values of the most active compounds of the invention are between 9 and 20 μM.<br>
The results of the preceding tests show that 10  certain compounds of the invention are selective<br>
     ligands for the a4β2 subunits of the nicotinic receptor. The compounds of the invention were finally the subject of in vivo  experiments which demonstrated their therapeutic properties, <br>
l5   Thus, for example, they were studied in the hotplate model, according to the method of Eddy and Leimbach, J.   Pharmacol.   Exp.   Ther.    (1953) 107 385-393 with the aim of investigating and quantifying a possible analgesic effect. 20 to 30 g mice" were subjected to a <br>
20	heat stimulus by contact of the paws with a plate maintained at a constant temperature of 57.5°C by a thermostatted water bath. The time of reaction to the pain, which is manifested by licking of the paws or jumping, is measured. Thus, after the pretreatment <br>
25  period carried out by the subcutaneous or oral route<br>
(each batch being formed of eight animals for the same pretreatment), the mice are placed individually on the  plate and the time of reaction to the pain is measured. The animal is removed, from the plate immediately after<br>
27<br><br>
manifestation of the pain. The maximum time of exposure      to the stimulus is 30 s. The mean reaction time<br>
    accompanied by the standard error of the mean (s.e.m.)<br>
is expressed for each batch. A non-parametric variance<br>
5	analysis (Kruskal-Wallis) is carried out on the entire<br>
batch. A Wilcoxon test allows the comparison of each<br>
treated batch with the control batch. The differences<br>
are considered as statistically significant at the 5%<br>
threshold.<br>
10	This reaction time is significantly increased by the<br>
analgesics mainly with central effects. The compounds of the invention show an' activity in this test at doses of between 3 and 30 mg/kg by the<br>
intraperitoneal or oral route.<br>
15	These results suggest the use of the compounds<br>
     in the treatment or prevention of disorders associated<br>
with a dysfunction of the nicotinic receptors,<br>
especially at the level of the central nervous system<br>
or the" gastrointestinal system.<br>
20            At the level of the central nervous system,<br>
     these disorders comprise cognitive impairments, more specifically memory impairments, but also attention impairments, associated with Alzheimer's disease, with pathological ageing (Age Associated Memory Impairment, <br>
25	AAMI), with Parkinson's disease, with mongolism (Down's syndrome), with Korsakoff's alcoholic syndrome, and with vascular dementia (multi-infarct dementia, MID). The compounds of the invention could likewise be useful in the treatment of the motor disorders observed in<br>
25 <br>
10<br><br><br>
Parkinson's disease or other neurological diseases such as Huntington's chorea, Tourette's syndrome, tardive dyskinesia and hyperkinesia.<br>
The compounds of invention can likewise constitute a<br>
 5curative or symptomatic treatment of cerebral vascular accidents and cerebral hypoxic episodes. They can be used in  the case  of psychiatric pathologies: schizophrenia, depression, anxiety, panic attacks, compulsive and obsessive behaviour.<br>
They can prevent the symptoms due to withdrawal from tobacco, alcohol and various substances inducing dependence, such as cocaine, LSD, cannabis and benzodiazepines.<br>
Finally, they can be used for the treatment of pain. <br>
      At the level of the gastrointestinal system, the compounds of the invention could be used in the treatment of Crohn's disease, of ulcerative colitis, of irritable bowel syndrome and of obesity.<br>
To this effect, the compounds of the invention can be present in -any form of composition appropriate for enteral, parenteral or transdermal administration, such as tablets, sugar-coated tablets, hard and soft gelatin capsules, drinkable or injectable suspensions or solutions such as syrups or ampoules, transdermal patches, etc., combined with suitable excipients, and dosed to allow a daily administration of 0.01 to 2 0 mg/kg.<br><br>
