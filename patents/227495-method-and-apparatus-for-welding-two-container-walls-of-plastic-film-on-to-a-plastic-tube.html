Title: Tube welding<br><br>
Technical Field<br>
The invention relates to a method according to the preamble to claim 1 and an apparatus according to the preamble to claim 3.<br>
Drainage bags such as urine bags, blood bags and the like are usually made from two superposed plastic films which are welded together along their periphery. For providing the bag with an outlet channel it is common to weld a plastic tube between the two plastic films to provide communication via the tube between the interior and the exterior of the bag. One of the plastic films id thus welded on to one half of the periphery of the plastic tube and the other plastic film is welded on to the other half of the periphery of the plastic tube. The two plastic films are welded together on both sides of the tube. However, optionally, the films may only be welded to the tube at the transition areas on each side of the tube, the films being drawn tightly over the periphery of the tube to avoid leakage. Optionally, an adhesive may be provided between the films and the periphery of the tube. <br>
In practice it has proved difficult to obtain a liquid-tight connection between the outer face of the plastic tube and the plastic films in the two transition areas in which the outer face of the plastic tube and the two plastic films meet. Even though two welding jaws are used, which each in a cross-sectional view has a semi-circular shape and jointly in closed position define a circular opening corresponding to the external diameter of the tube, leaks often arise in the mentioned areas.<br>
Background Art<br>
From GB 2193485A it is known to insert a stiffening sleeve in the plastic tube at the weld point to prevent deformation of the plastic tube during welding. US 4.126.167 discloses the use of a nozzle arrangement with wedge-shaped parts instead of a plas-tic tube with a circular cross section, said wedge-shaped parts extending between the bag walls to prevent an abrupt transition between the plastic films and the nozzle ar-<br>

rangement. From EP 0269419 Al it is known to arrange a nozzle on the outer face of the plastic tube and the plastic films to ensure a liquid-tight seal between the tube and the bag.<br>
DE 19752648 Cl discloses pre-heating of the plastic tube before it is welded together with the plastic films to improve the weld in the critical transition areas.<br>
From EP 0491380 A2 it is known to arrange shaped pieces of a heat-conducting material around the plastic tube and the plastic films during the welding process and to remove the shaped pieces from the plastic tube and the plastic films only after the welded areas have cooled.<br>
US 4.023.607 discloses a method of welding two plastic films on to a plastic tube having a circular cross-section by means of two welding jaws defining an opening with a non-circular cross-section.<br>
Description of the Invention<br>
The object of the invention is to provide a new and simple method of welding a plastic tube between two container walls of plastic film so as to obtain a liquid-tight weld. According to the invention the object is obtained by the method stated in the introduction being characterised in that in a cross-sectional view each welding jaw having a substantially linear welding portion extending substantially perpendicular to the joint face between the joint face and each end of the curved welding area. By these simple means it has surprisingly been possible to obtain very reliable welds in the critical areas, in which one of the plastic films changes from being welded together with the other plastic film to being welded on to the plastic tube.<br>
According to an embodiment the curved welding area of the welding jaws may be provided with a radius of curvature slightly exceeding the outer diameter of the plastic tube and further be dimensioned such that during closing of the welding jaws<br>
AMENDED PAGE.<br><br>

the portions of the plastic tube are pressed outwardly against the linear welding portions of the welding jaws. As a result a reliable welding connection is thus obtained in the critical areas, the plastic films and the plastic tube being further compressed during welding.<br>
The invention further relates to an apparatus as stated in the introduction. The apparatus according to the invention is characterised in that in a cross-sectional view each welding jaw has a curved welding area and a substantially linear welding portion extending substantially perpendicular to the joint face of the welding jaws between the joint face and one end of the curved welding area.<br>
Even though it normally is preferable to arrange the plastic tube such between two container walls of plastic film that a sealing seam extends between the two layers of plastic film on both sides of the plastic tube, the plastic tube may, however, also be arranged at an edge of the container such that the same plastic film extends 360Â° around the plastic tube and such that only one sealing seam extends between the two layers of plastic film on one side of the plastic tube.<br>
AMENDED PAGE<br><br>

According to an advantageous embodiment each welding jaw has a substantially linear welding portion between each end of the curved welding area and the joint face.<br>
According to an embodiment the welding jaws each include a resistance wire defining the curved welding area and the linear welding portion(s), said resistance wires being adapted to join the plastic tube and the plastic films together by impulse heat welding or constant-heat welding.<br>
According to an optional embodiment the welding jaws are shaped as ultrasonic welding jaws or constant-heat welding jaws.<br>

Best Modes for Carrying out the Invention<br>
Fig. 1 is a cross-sectional view through a portion of a drainage bag, eg. a urine bag, in which a plastic tube 3 is welded between two plastic films 1, 2, which each forms a bag wall and are sealed together along the periphery of the bag outside of the plastic tube 3.<br>
In the method according to the invention the plastic films 1,2 are welded to at least a portion of the outer periphery of the plastic tube 3 and joined in the areas 8 abutting the plastic tube 3. Conventionally the areas denoted by the reference numeral 4 in Fig. 1 are particularly critical in that triangular cavities arise therein, when the plastic films 1, 2 are placed about the plastic tube 3, said cavities having to be filled by melted material to prevent leakage. Even though the welding is performed carefully such that leaks do not occur at the points 4, leaks may occur at a later stage. The latter may for instance occur if the bag is handled and mechanically stressed before the weld is sufficiently cooled or if the plastic films are heavily pulled, as stress concentrations arise at the points 4, whereby the plastic films 1, 2 may come loose from the plastic tube 3 such that leaks arise.<br>
Fig. 2 illustrates a first apparatus for carrying out the method according to the invention. The apparatus is an ultrasonic welding apparatus with two welding jaws 5, 6 abutting each other at a joint face 7 in the shown closed state. In a cross-sectional view each welding jaw 5, 6 has a curved area 11 and two substantially linear portions 10 extending between the ends of the curved area 11 and the joint face 7. The curved areas 11 correspond substantially to the periphery of the plastic tube 3, which is to be welded together with the plastic films 1, 2. However, the curved areas may have a radius of curvature slightly exceeding that of the plastic tube 3 for reasons which will be explained in detail below.<br>
Fig. 3 illustrates the apparatus shown in Fig. 2 during a welding process, in which a plastic tube 3 is welded together with two plastic films 1, 2 and in which the plastic films 1,2 are welded together in the area outside of the plastic tube 3. As can be seen<br>
AMENDED PAGE<br><br>
6<br>
from Fig. 3, the plastic tube 3 is deformed when enclosed by the welding jaws 5, 6, the plastic tube 3 thereby being provided with two plane portions 9 extending a short distance on each side of the joint face 7 and perpendicular thereto. When the welding jaws 5, 6 are closed about the plastic tube 3 and the plastic films 1, 2, as shown in Fig. 3, the plastic material is subjected to pressure waves via the welding jaws 5, 6 such that heating occurs in the joints between the plastic film 1, 2 and the plastic tube 3 and between the two plastic films 1,2, whereby a weld is obtained. The welding jaws 5, 6 shown in Figs. 2 and 3 may, however, also be shaped as welding jaws welding at constant heat.<br>
By the deformation shown in Fig. 3 of the plastic tube 3 with two plane portions 9 extending substantially perpendicular to the joint face 7 an extremely tight and reliable joining in the critical areas 4 is obtained in a surprising manner.<br>
After welding, the plastic tube 3 adopts its original circular shape.<br>
As mentioned above the curved areas 11 of the welding jaws may be shaped as circular arches with a radius slightly larger than the outer radius of the plastic tube 3. A slight compression is thus obtained providing an outward load on the portions 9 of the plastic tube 3 situated close to the joint face 7, which in turn ensures and enhances the weld in the critical areas 4.<br>
Fig. 4 illustrates an alternative embodiment of an apparatus according to the invention. By means of the apparatus shown in Fig. 4 the plastic films 1, 2 are welded on to the outer face of the plastic tube 3 by impulse heat welding or constant-heat welding, the welding jaws 5,6 each comprising a resistance wire.<br>
The details shown in the figures are diagrammatic and certain geometries have been exaggerated to render the principles of the invention more clearly. In practice, the inner cross-section of the welding jaws 5, 6 in figures 2-4 have a more "flattened" shape to exert an upward and downward force on the plastic tube, said force pressing<br>
AMENDED PAGE<br><br>
7<br>
the surface of the plastic tube 3 against the linear welding portions 10 of the welding jaws 5,6.<br>
The method and apparatus according to the invention make it possible to perform a complete welding between the plastic films 1, 2 and the plastic tube 3 and between the plastic films 1, 2 in the areas 8 abutting the plastic tube 3. In practice, it is, however, advantageous to perform a pre-welding, in which the plastic films are tacked together and to the plastic tube 3 to facilitate the handling thereof prior to the final welding.<br>
In order not to spoil the provided welds, the plastic material should be allowed to cool down before being subjected to mechanical stresses.<br>
It is also possible to extend a single plastic film 360Â° around the plastic tube and weld it onto itself. As a result, a bag with the outlet tube in a corner is obtained. Various plastic materials may be used for the plastic tube 3 and the plastic films 1,2, eg. PVC, polyethylene or polypropylene.<br>
As plastic film PVC of a thickness of 0.1-0.3 mm is typically used. The plastic tube 3 may typically be made from PVC and have an outer diameter of 6-20 mm and a wall thickness of 0.5-1 mm.<br>
