HELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention involves compounds represented by Formula (I) herein below,<br>
pharmaceutical compositions comprising such compounds and methods of suppressing<br>
the growth of cancers and other proliferative diseases using such compounds.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
There are many human and veterinary diseases that stem from processes of uncontrolled<br>
or abnormal cellular proliferation. Most important among these diseases is cancer, the<br>
generic name given to a broad range of cellular malignancies characterized by unregulated<br>
growth and lack of differentiation. Psoriasis is another disease that is characterized by<br>
uncontrolled or abnormal cellular proliferation. Psoriasis is a common chronic skin disease<br>
characterized by the presence of dry scales and plaques. The disease results from<br>
hyperproliferation of the epidermis and incomplete differentiation of keratinocytes.<br>
Psoriasis often involves the scalp, elbows, knees, back, buttocks, nails, eyebrows, and<br>
genital regions, and may range in severity from mild to extremely debilitating, resulting in<br>
psoriatic arthritis, pustular psoriasis, and exfoliative psoriatic dermatitis. There is, at<br>
present, no general therapeutic cure that exists for psoriasis. Whilst milder cases are often<br>
treated with topical corticosteroids, more severe cases may be treated with antiproliferative<br>
agents, such as the antimetabolite methotrexate, the DNA synthesis inhibitor hydroxyurea,<br>
and the microtubule disrupter colchicine.<br>
Other diseases associated with an abnormally high level of cellular proliferation include<br>
restenosis, where vascular smooth muscle cells are involved; inflammatory disease states,<br>
where endothelial cells, inflammatory cells and glomerular cells are involved; myocardial<br>
infarction, where heart muscle cells are involved; glomerular nephritis, where kidney cells<br>
are involved; transplant rejection, where endothelial cells are involved; and infectious<br>
diseases such as HIV infection and malaria, where certain immune cells and/or other<br>
infected cells are involved.<br>
Inhibition of cellular proliferation can be brought about by several mechanisms, including;<br>
alkylating agents; topoisomerase inhibitors; nucleotide analogues; antibiotics; hormone<br>
antagonists; and nucleic acid damaging agents; inter alia. One pharmacologically<br>
important mechanism of inhibiting cellular profileration is by means of binding tubulin.<br>
Tubulin is an asymmetric dimer composed of alpha and beta subunits, that polymerizes to<br>
form structural components of the cytoskeleton called microtubules. Microtubules must be<br>
highly dynamic in order to carry out many of their functions. At certain stages of the cell<br>
cycle, or in particular cell types or organelles, stable microtubules are required, such as for<br>
transport within axons or for ciliary and flagellar movement. Micro-tubules assemble<br>
during the G2 phase of the cell cycle, and participate in the formation of the mitotic spindle<br>
which facilitates the segregation of sister chromatids during the process of cell division.<br>
The essential role of microtubules in cell division and the ability of drugs that interact with<br>
tubulin to interfere with the cell cycle have made tubulin a successful target for<br>
applications that include anti-cancer drugs, fungicides, and herbicides. Typical tubulin<br>
ligands such as colchicine, paclitaxel, the Vinca alkaloids such as vinblastine, the<br>
epothilones, the halicondrins, benomyl and mebendazole directly inhibit cell division by<br>
binding to tubulin which leads to the arrest of the cell cycle at the G2/M boundary of<br>
mitosis. This mechanism is the basis of the therapeutic value of compounds of this type,<br>
such as treating gout with colchicine, restenosis with paditaxel, cancer with paditaxel,<br>
vinblastine, epothilones and halichondrins, and fungal infections with benomyl and<br>
malaria and helminths with mebendazole.<br>
Interfering with microtubule dynamics or stability can inhibit cell division in several ways.<br>
Both stabilizing microtubules or inhibiting their polymerization will prevent the<br>
cytoskeleton restructuring that is required at several points in the cell cyde and lead to an<br>
arrest of the cell's progression from one stage in the cell cyde to the next. Three main<br>
classes of tubulin-binding drugs, namely colchidine analogues, Vinca alkaloids, and the<br>
taxanes, have been identified, each of which possesses a specific binding site on the p-<br>
tubulin molecule. Paditaxel (Taxol™) and related taxanes represent a class of drugs that<br>
stabilize microtubules, a process that ultimately leads to the "freezing" of the microtubule<br>
structures so that they cannot be restructured (Jordan M A. and Wilson L., 1998).<br>
Subsequent arrest at mitosis induces the apoptotic mechanism to cause cell death. A<br>
number of colchidne analogues, as well as several other compounds that bind to the same<br>
site on ß-tubulin as colchidne disrupt tubulin polymerization and disrupt microtubular<br>
formation. Vinblastine and several other vinca-related drugs bind to a site that is distinct<br>
from the colchicine site. Compounds that bind at the Vinca-site prevent microtubule<br>
formation and destabilize microtubules (Jordan et al, 1986; Rai and Wolff (1996). This<br>
invention is therefore directed to compounds that potentially modulate microtubule<br>
dynamics by binding to tubulin.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention aims to provide compounds which are directly or<br>
indirectly toxic to actively dividing cells and are useful in the treatment of cancer, viral and<br>
bacterial infections, vascular restenosis, inflammatory diseases, autoimmune diseases, or<br>
psoriasis. The present invention is also directed to therapeutic compositions for treating<br>
said conditions. Further aspects of the invention are to provide methods for killing actively<br>
proliferating cells, such as cancerous, bacterial, or epithelial cells, and treating all types of<br>
cancers, infections, inflammatory, and generally proliferative conditions. A further aspect<br>
relates to provide methods for treating other medical conditions characterized by the<br>
presence of rapidly proliferating cells, such as psoriasis and other skin disorders.<br>
In one embodiment, the method of the invention is used in the treatment of sarcomas,<br>
carcinomas and/or leukemias. Exemplary disorders for which the subject method can be<br>
used alone or as part of a treatment regimen include: fibrosarcoma, myxosarcoma,<br>
liposarcoma, chondrosarcoma, osteogenic sarcoma, chordoma, angiosarcoma,<br>
endotheliosarcorna, lymphangiosarcoma, lymphangioendotheliosarcoma, synovioma,<br>
mesothelioma, Ewing's tumor, leiomyosarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, colon carcinoma,<br>
pancreatic cancer, breast cancer, ovarian cancer, prostate cancer, squamous cell carcinoma,<br>
basal cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, sweat gland carcinoma, sebaceous gland carcinoma,<br>
papillary carcinoma, papillary adenocarcinomas, cystadenocarcinoma, medullary<br>
carcinoma, bronchogenic carcinoma, renal cell carcinoma, hepatoma, bile duct carcinoma,<br>
choriocarcinoma, seminoma, embryonal carcinoma, Wilms' tumor, cervical cancer,<br>
testicular tumor, lung carcinoma, small cell lung carcinoma, bladder carcinoma, epithelial<br>
carcinoma, glioma, astrocytoma, medulloblastoma, craniopharyngioma, ependymoma,<br>

In certain embodiments, the method of the invention is to be used to treat disorders such as<br>
carcinomas forming from tissue of the breast, prostate, kidney, bladder or colon.<br>
In other embodiments, the method of the invention is used to treat hyperplastic or<br>
neoplastic disorders arising in adipose tissue, such as adipose cell tumors, e.g., lipomas,<br>
fibrolipomas, lipoblastomas, lipomatosis, hibemomas, hemangiomas and/or liposarcomas.<br>
In still other embodiments, infectious and parasitic agents (e.g. bacteria, trypanosomes,<br>
fungi, etc) can also be controlled using the subject compositions and compounds.<br>

state or disorder in an amount effective therefore, and a pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
vehicle or diluent. The compositions of the present invention may contain other<br>
therapeutic agents as described below, and may be formulated, for example, by employing<br>
conventional solid or liquid vehicles or diluents, as well as pharmaceutical additives of a<br>
type appropriate to the mode of desired administration (for example, excipients, binders,<br>
preservatives, stabilizers, flavors, etc.) according to techniques such as those well known in<br>
the art of pharmaceutical formulation.<br>
The compounds of the formula I or II may be administered by any suitable means, for<br>
example, orally, such as in the form of tablets, capsules, granules or powders; sublingually;<br>

promoted, in order to modulate the inflammatory response.<br>
The subjects treated in the above methods, in whom which cell growth inhibition is<br>
desired, are mammals, including, but not limited to, cows, sheep, goats, horses, dogs, cats,<br>
guinea pigs, rats or other bovine, ovine, equine, canine, feline, rodent or murine species,<br>
and preferably a human being, male or female.<br>
The term "therapeutically effective amount" means the amount of the subject composition<br>
that will elicit the biological or medical response of a tissue, system, animal or human that<br>
is being sought by the researcher, veterinarian, medical doctor or other clinician.<br>
The term "composition" as used herein is intended to encompass a product comprising the<br>
specified ingredients in the specified amounts, as well as any product which results,<br>
directly or indirectly, from combination of the specified ingredients in the specified<br>
amounts. By "pharmaceutically acceptable" it is meant the carrier, diluent or excipient<br>
must be compatible with the other ingredients of the formulation and not deleterious to the<br>
recipient thereof.<br>
The terms "administration of and or "administering a" compound should be understood to<br>
mean providing a compound of the invention to the individual in need of treatment.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions for the administration of the compounds of this<br>
invention may conveniently be presented in dosage unit form and may be prepared by any<br>
of the methods well known in the art of pharmacy. All methods include the step of<br>
bringing the active ingredient into association with the carrier which constitutes one or<br>
more accessory ingredients. In general, the pharmaceutical compositions are prepared by<br>
uniformly and intimately bringing the active ingredient into association with a liquid<br>
carrier or a finely divided solid carrier or both, and then, if necessary, shaping the product<br>
into the desired formulation. In the pharmaceutical composition the active object<br>
compound is included in an amount sufficient to produce the desired effect upon the<br>
process or condition of diseases. As used herein, the term "composition" is intended to<br>
encompass a product comprising the specified ingredients in the specified amounts, as well<br>
as any product which results, directly or indirectly, from combination of the specified<br>
ingredients in the specified amounts.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions containing the active ingredient may be in a form<br>
suitable for oral use, for example, as tablets, troches, lozenges, aqueous or oily suspensions,<br>
dispersible powders or granules, emulsions, hard or soft capsules, or syrups or elixirs.<br>
Compositions intended for oral use may be prepared according to any method known to<br>
the art for the manufacture of pharmaceutical compositions and such compositions may<br>
contain one or more agents selected from the group consisting of sweetening agents,<br>
flavoring agents, coloring agents and preserving agents in order to provide<br>
pharmaceutically elegant and palatable preparations. Tablets contain the active ingredient<br>
in admixture with non-toxic pharmaceutically acceptable excipients which are suitable for<br>
the manufacture of tablets. These excipients may be for example, inert diluents, such as<br>
calcium carbonate, sodium carbonate, lactose, calcium phosphate or sodium phosphate;<br>
granulating and disintegrating agents, for example, corn starch, or alginic acid; binding<br>
agents, for example starch, gelatin or acacia, and lubricating agents, for example<br>
magnesium stearate, stearic acid or talc. The tablets may be uncoated or they may be<br>
coated by known techniques to delay disintegration and absorption in the gastrointestinal<br>
tract and thereby provide a sustained action over a longer period. For example, a time<br>
delay material such as glyceryl monostearate or glyceryl distearate may be employed.<br>
They may also be coated to form osmotic therapeutic tablets for control release.<br>
Formulations for oral use may also be presented as hard gelatin capsules wherein the<br>
active ingredient is mixed with an inert solid diluent, for example, calcium carbonate,<br>
calcium phosphate or kaolin, or as soft gelatin capsules wherein the active ingredient is<br>
mixed with water or an oil medium, for example peanut oil, liquid paraffin, or olive oil.<br>
Aqueous suspensions contain the active materials in admixture with excipients suitable for<br>
the manufacture of aqueous suspensions. Such excipients are suspending agents, for<br>
example sodium carboxymethylcellulose, methylcellulose, hydroxy-propylmethylcellulose,<br>
sodium alginate, polyvinyl-pyrrolidone, gum tragacanth and gum acacia; dispersing or<br>
wetting agents may be a naturally-occurring phosphatide, for example lecithin, or<br>
condensation products of an alkylene oxide with fatty acids, for example polyoxyethylene<br>
stearate, or condensation products of ethylene oxide with long chain aliphatic alcohols, for<br>
example heptadecaethyleneoxycetanol, or condensation products of ethylene oxide with<br>
partial esters derived from fatty acids and a hexitol such as polyoxyethylene sorbitol<br>
monooleate, or condensation products of ethylene oxide with partial esters derived from<br>
fatty acids and hexitol anhydrides, for example polyethylene sorbitan monooleate. The<br>
aqueous suspensions may also contain one or more preservatives, for example ethyl, or n-<br>
propyl, p-hydroxybenzoate, one or more coloring agents, one or more flavoring agents,<br>
and one or more sweetening agents, such as sucrose or saccharin.<br>
Oily suspensions may be formulated by suspending the active ingredient in a vegetable oil,<br>
for example arachis oil, olive oil, sesame oil or coconut oil, or in a mineral oil such as liquid<br>
paraffin. The oily suspensions may contain a thickening agent, for example beeswax, hard<br>
paraffin or cetyl alcohol. Sweetening agents such as those set forth above, and flavoring<br>
agents may be added to provide a palatable oral preparation. These compositions may be<br>
preserved by the addition of an anti-oxidant such as ascorbic add.<br>
Dispersible powders and granules suitable for preparation of an aqueous suspension by<br>
the addition of water provide the active ingredient in admixture with a dispersing or<br>
wetting agent, suspending agent and one or more preservatives. Suitable dispersing or<br>
wetting agents and suspending agents are exemplified by those already mentioned above.<br>
Additional excipients, for example sweetening, flavoring and coloring agents, may also be<br>
present.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions of the invention may also be in the form of oil-in-water<br>
emulsions. The oily phase may be a vegetable oil, for example olive oil or arachis oil, or a<br>
mineral oil, for example liquid paraffin or mixtures of these. Suitable emulsifying agents<br>
may be naturally- occurring gums, for example gum acacia or gum tragacanth, naturally-<br>
occurring phosphatides, for example soy bean, lecithin, and esters or partial esters derived<br>
from fatty acids and hexitol anhydrides, for example sorbitan monooleate, and<br>
condensation products of the said partial esters with ethylene oxide, for example<br>
polyoxyethylene sorbitan monooleate. The emulsions may also contain sweetening and<br>
flavoring agents.<br>
Syrups and elixirs may be formulated with sweetening agents, for example glycerol,<br>
propylene glycol, sorbitol or sucrose. Such formulations may also contain a demulcent, a<br>
preservative and flavoring and coloring agents.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions may be in the form of a sterile injectable aqueous or<br>
oleagenous suspension. This suspension may be formulated according to the known art<br>
using those suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents which have been<br>
mentioned above. The sterile injectable preparation may also be a sterile injectable solution<br>
or suspension in a non-toxic parenterally-acceptable diluent or solvent, for example as a<br>
solution in 1,3-butane diol. Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that may be<br>
employed are water, Ringer's solution and isotonic sodium chloride solution. In addition,<br>
sterile, fixed oils are conventionally employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For<br>
this purpose any bland fixed oil may be employed including synthetic mono- or<br>
diglycerides. In addition, fatty acids such as oleic acid find use in the preparation of<br>
injectables.<br>
The compounds of the present invention may also be administered in the form of<br>
suppositories for rectal administration of the drug. These compositions can be prepared by<br>
mixing the drug with a suitable non-irritating excipient which is solid at ordinary<br>
temperatures but liquid at the rectal temperature and will therefore melt in the rectum to<br>
release the drug. Such materials are cocoa butter and polyethylene glycols.<br>
For topical use, creams, ointments, jellies, solutions or suspensions, etc., containing the<br>
compounds of the present invention are employed. (For purposes of this application,<br>
topical application shall include mouthwashes and gargles.)<br>
The compounds of the present invention can also be administered in the form of liposomes.<br>
As is known in the art, liposomes are generally derived from phospholipids or other lipid<br>
substances. Liposomes are formed by mono- or multilamellar hydrated liquid crystals that<br>
are dispersed in an aqueous medium. Any non-toxic, physiologically acceptable and<br>
metabolisable lipid capable of forming liposomes can be used. The present compositions in<br>
liposome form can contain, in addition to a compound of the present invention, stabilisers,<br>
preservatives, excipients and the like. The preferred lipids are the phospholipids and<br>
phosphatidyl cholines, both natural and synthetic. Methods to form liposomes are known<br>
in the art<br>
The pharmaceutical composition and method of the present invention may further<br>
comprise other therapeutically active compounds as noted herein which are usually<br>
applied in the treatment of the above mentioned pathological conditions. Selection of the<br>
appropriate agents for use in combination therapy may be made by one of ordinary skill in<br>
the art, according to conventional pharmaceutical principles. The combination of<br>
therapeutic agents may act synergistically to effect the treatment or prevention of the<br>
various disorders described above. Using this approach, one may be able to achieve<br>
therapeutic efficacy with lower dosages of each agent, thus reducing the potential for<br>
adverse side effects.<br>
Examples of other therapeutic agents include the following:<br>
cyclosporins (e.g., cyclosporin A), CTLA4-Ig, antibodies such as ICAM-3, anti-IL-2 receptor<br>
(Anti-Tac), anti-CD45RB, anti-CD2, anti-CD3 (OKT-3), anti-CD4, anti-CD80, anti-CD86,<br>
agents blocking the interaction between CD40 and gp39, such as antibodies specific for<br>
CD40 and/or gp39 (i.e., CD154), fusion proteins constructed from CD40 and gp39 (CD401g<br>
and GD8gp39), inhibitors, such as nuclear translocation inhibitors, of NF-kappa B function,<br>
such as deoxyspergualin (DSG), cholesterol biosynthesis inhibitors such as HMG CoA<br>
reductase inhibitors (lovastatin and simvastatin), non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs<br>
(NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen, aspirin, acetaminophen and cyclooxygenase inhibitors such as<br>

vincristine, fluorodeoxyuridine, melphalan and cyclophosphamide, TNF-a inhibitors such<br>
as tenidap, anti-TNF antibodies or soluble TNF receptor, and rapamydn (sirolimus or<br>
Rapamune) or derivatives thereof.<br>

present invention they may be used for example in amounts as noted in the Physician Desk<br>
Reference (PDR) or as otherwise determined by one of ordinary skill in the art<br>
The pharmaceutical composition and method of the present invention may further<br>
comprise other therapeutically active compounds as noted herein which are known<br>
inhibitors or substrates of drug efflux systems or drug detoxification and excretory<br>
systems. Such systems include P-glycoprotein, multidrug resistance-associated protein,<br>
lung resistance protein and glutathione S-transferase isoenzymes alpha, mu, pi, sigma,<br>
theta, zeta and kappa. Co-administration of drugs known to inhibit or reduce the activity<br>
of these systems may increase the efficacy of the compounds described in the present<br>
invention through increasing the amount of therapeutic agent in the cell. Using this<br>
approach, one may be able to achieve therapeutic efficacy with lower dosages, thus<br>
reducing the potential for adverse side effects. Examples of inhibitors or substrates for<br>
these systems include; verapamil, probenecid, dipyridamole, ethacrynic acid,<br>
indomethacin, sulfasalazine, buthionine sulfoximine, cyclosporin A and tamoxifen.<br>
In the treatment or prevention of hyperproliferation-related disorders or disease states an<br>
appropriate dosage level will generally be about 0.01 to 500 mg per kg patient body weight<br>
per day which can be administered in single or multiple doses. Preferably, the dosage level<br>
will be about 0.1 to about 250 mg/kg per day; more preferably about 0.5 to about 100<br>
mg/kg per day. A suitable dosage level may be about 0.01 to 250 mg/kg per day, about<br>
0.05 to 100 mg/kg per day, or about 0.1 to 50 mg/kg per day. Within this range the dosage<br>
may be 0.05 to 0.5,0..5 to 5 or 5 to 50 mg/kg per day. For oral administration, the<br>

treated. The compounds may be administered on a regimen of 1 to 4 times per day,<br>
preferably once or twice per day.<br>
It will be understood, however, that the specific dose level and frequency of dosage for any<br>
particular patient may be varied and will depend upon a variety of factors including the<br>
activity of the specific compound employed, the metabolic stability and length of action of<br>
that compound, the age, body weight general health, sex, diet mode and time of<br>
administration, rate of excretion, drug combination, the severity of the particular condition,<br>
and the host undergoing therapy.<br>

In order that the nature of the present invention may be more dearly understood preferred<br>
forms thereof will now be described by reference to the following non-limiting Examples.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
MATERIALS AND METHODS:<br>
Compound Synthesis<br>
Compounds are generally prepared in a 2-step process starting from 2,6-dichloropyrazine.<br>
The first step is a nucleophilic aromatic substitution to generate a monoamino-monohalo<br>
intermediate. (Scheme 1).<br><br>
The nucleophilic aromatic substitution is typically carried out by addition of a primary<br>
amine to the di-halogenated heterocycle in a solvent such as ethanol, isopropanol, tert-<br>
butanol, dioxane, THF, DMF, ethoxyethanol, toluene or xylene. The reaction is typically<br>
performed at elevated temperature in the presence of excess amine or a non-nudeophilic<br>
base such as triethylamine or diisopropylethylamine, or an inorganic base such as<br>
potassium carbonate or sodium carbonate.<br>
Alternatively, the amino substituent may be introduced through a transition metal<br>
catalysed amination reaction. Typical catalysts for such transformations include<br>
Pd(OAc)2/P(t-Bu)3, Pd2(dba)3/BINAP and Pd(OAc)2/BINAP. These reactions are typically<br>
carried out in solvents such as toluene or dioxane, in the presence of bases such as caesium<br>
carbonate or sodium or potassium tert-butoxide at temperatures ranging from room<br>
temperature to reflux.<br>
The amines employed in the first step of the synthesis of these compounds are obtained<br>
commercially or are prepared using methods well known to those skilled in the art. Of<br>
particular interest are a-alkylbenzylamines which may be prepared through reduction of<br>
oximes (Scheme 2). Typical reductants include lithium aluminium hydride, hydrogen gas<br>
in the presence of palladium on charcoal catalyst, Zn in the presence of hydrochloric add,<br>
sodium borohydride in the presence of a Lewis add such as TiCl3, ZrCl4, NiCl2 and MoO3,<br>
or sodium borohydride in conjunction with Amberlyst H15 ion exchange resin and LiCl.<br><br>
a-Alkylbenzylamines may also be prepared by reductive amination of the corresponding<br>
ketones. A dassical method for such a transformation is the Leuckart-Wallach reaction,<br>
though catalytic conditions or alternative procedures (e.g. NH4OAc, Na(CN)BH3) can also<br>
be used.<br>
a-Alkylbenzylamines may also be prepared from the corresponding a-alkylbenzyl<br>
alcohols. Such methods include derivatisation of the hydroxyl as a mesylate or tosylate<br>
and displacement with a nitrogen nudeophile, such as phthalimide or azide which is<br>
converted to the primary amine using conventional synthetic methods; or, displacement of<br>
the hydroxyl with a suitable nitrogen nudeophile under Mitsunobu-like conditions. <x-></x->
Alkylbenzyl alcohols can be prepared by reduction of the corresponding ketones with a<br>
reducing agent such as sodium borohydride in a solvent such as methanol. Alternatively,<br>
a-alkylbenzyl alcohols can be obtained through addition of an alkyl metal species (such as<br>
a Grignard reagent) to a benzaldehyde derivative, typically performed at room<br>
temperature or below in solvents such as tetrahydrofuran.<br>
a-Alkyl benzylamines of high optical purity may be prepared from chiral a-alkyl benzyl<br>
alcohols using the methods outlined above. The chiral a-alkyl benzyl alcohols may be<br>
obtained through chiral reduction of the corresponding ketones. Chiral reducing methods<br>
are now well known in organic chemistry and include enzymatic processes, asymmetric<br>
hydrogenation procedures and chiral oxazaborolidines.<br>
The second step of the synthesis typically involves a palladium mediated cross-coupling of<br>
the monoaminomonochloro intermediate with a suitably functionalised coupling partner.<br>
Typical coupling partners are boronic acids (Suzuki coupling: see for example Miyaura, N.<br>
and Suzuki, Chem Rev. 1995, P52457) or stannaries (Stille coupling: see for example Stille,<br>
J.K., Angew. Chem., Int. Ed. Engl, 1986,25,508) (Scheme 3).<br><br>
The Suzuki coupling is the preferred coupling method and is typically performed in a<br>
solvent such as DME, THF, DMF, ethanol, propanol, toluene, or 1,4-dioxane in the presence<br>
of a base such as potassium carbonate, lithium hydroxide, caesium carbonate, sodium<br>
hydroxide, potassium fluoride or potassium phosphate. The reaction may be carried out at<br>
elevated temperatures and the palladium catalyst employed may be selected from<br>
Pd(PPh3)4, Pd(OAc)2, [PdCl2(dppf)], Pd2(dba)3/P(t-Bu)3, Pd/C.<br>
The products formed from this reaction sequence may be further derivatised using<br>
techniques well-known to those skilled in the art. Alternatively, derivatisation of the<br>
mono-amino mono-chloropyrazine may be undertaken prior to displacement of the 6-<br>
chloro substituent This derivatisation typically involves functionality originally present<br>
on the amine species and employs methods well known to those skilled in the art.<br>
Representative syntheses are reported below.<br>

was treated with DBU (1.9 mL, 12.8 mmol). The resulting solution was stirred at room<br>
temperature for 20 hours and then diluted with a mixture of ether and H2O. The organic<br>
phase was dried and concentrated and the residue purified by column chromatography<br>

at room temperature for 64 h. The aqueous phase was collected and the organic phase<br>
extracted with 10% HCl (3 x 5mL). The aqueous layers were combined and basified with<br>
5M NaOH, and men extracted with ethyl acetate (5 x 15mL). The organic phase was dried<br>
and concentrated to give pure amine (0.4 g, 54%).<br>
