FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a nutritional product for HIV patients. More specifically the invention relates to a nutritional composition that provides carefully selected nutritional ingredients specifically supporting HIV patients with nutritionally related symptoms. This invention also relates to the manufacture of a nutritional supplement for use in HIV patients.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Infections with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and the development of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) have had a significant impact on domestic and global health, social, political, and economic outcomes. Worldwide, the number of HIV-1 infected persons exceeds 40 million, the majority of whom live in Asia, sub-Saharan Africa and South America. Despite all the therapeutic advantages achieved during the last decade, including the development of highly active antiretroviral therapy ("HAART"), once an individual has become infected, eradication of the virus still remains impossible.<br>
The importance of nutritional support of HIV infected persons is recognized nowadays. Infected patients may have increased needs for basal energy, proteins, and micronutrients due<br>
to the metabolic stress they experience. This stress, coupled with the anorexia and mal-<br>
i absorption associated with the disease, promotes malnutrition. Malnutrition generally affects<br>
e.g. the immune-competence, (work) performance and cognition. Providing extra nutrition helps these patients to improve their general nutritional status.<br>
Currently several products arc on the market for nutritional support of HIV patients. Different commercial suppliers have several clinical nutrition products on the market, which are listed below.<br>

However, despite the availability of products which support the general nutritional requirements of HIV infected patients, there are no nutritional products available which do not only improve the nutritional status but which additionally significantly reduce or prevent specific HIV infection related symptoms, in particular immune dysfunction, intestinal dysfunction and/or glutathione status of the subjects.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The current nutritional treatments of HIV patients have the disadvantage that these do not give an overall solution for all the nutritionally related medical problems of HIV patients, in particular infection related immune dysfunction, intestinal dysfunction and/or glutathione status. In one embodiment the present invention relates to the use of oligosaccharides and cysteine and/or source of cysteine in the manufacture of a composition for use in a method<br>
for the treatment and/or prevention of HIV or AIDS, said method comprising administering in mammal a composition comprising a therapeutically effective amount of oligosaccharide and cysteine and/or source of cysteine. In another embodiment the compositions further comprise one or more polyunsaturatcd fatty acids (PUFAs) and/or one or more biologically active compounds, in particular milk-derived compounds.<br>
The present invention provides complete nutritional supplements suitable for the nutritional treatment of HIV patients. The nutritional supplements of the present invention comprise at least 2, preferably at least 3 components supporting the subject's gut function, glutathione (GSH) status and/or immune function. It was surprisingly found that, by carefully choosing combinations of nutritional ingredients, several nutrition-related side effects of the HIV infection (i.e. infection related symptoms) can be prevented and/or significantly reduced. The effect was found to be much better when several disease related symptoms were targeted at the same time than when the patient was given only one of the individual ingredients as has been practiced until today.<br>
A healthy gut and healthy gut flora arc intricately linked to healthy immune function. Potential immune modulating effects by specific fibers/oligosaccharides may be the indirect result of the influence on the gut flora composition (immune effects of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli types have been documented) and/or function (fermentation of fibers produces compounds such as short chain fatty acids that influence general and immunological function of gut cells). Surprisingly the inventors found that the DC-SIGN molecule of dendritic cells can be blocked by certain oligosaccharides. As the blockage of this molecule can potentially prevent the transmission of HIV, the use of these oligosaccharides for blocking the DC-SIGN receptor and for the manufacture of compositions for the prophylaxis and/or treatment of DC-SIGN mediated diseases (in particular HIV and AIDS) is provided in one embodiment of the invention.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
General definitions<br>
"Oligosaccharides" refers to carbohydrate chains of monosaccharidc units with a chain length<br>
of between 1 and 5000, more preferably between 2 and 250, more preferably between 2 and<br>
50, most preferably between 2 and 10.<br>
"Degree of polymerisation" or "DP" refers to the total number of saccharide units in an<br>
.pligosaccharide chain. The "average DP" refers to the average DP of oligosaccharide chains<br>
in a composition, without taking possible mono- or disaccharides into account (which are<br>
preferably removed if present). The average DP of a composition is used to distinguish<br>
between compositions. Preferably the average degree of polymerization of oligosaccharide<br>
mixtures is between 2 and 100, more preferably between 3 and 250, e.g. between 3 and 50.<br>
"Co-administration"  of two  or more  substances  refers  to  the  administration  of these<br>
substances to one individual, either in one composition or in separate compositions (kit of<br>
parts; as a combined composition), which are administered at the same time (simultaneously)<br>
or within a short time-span (separate or sequential use, e.g. within minutes or hours).<br>
The term "comprising" is to be interpreted as specifying the presence of the stated parts, steps<br>
or components, but does not exclude the presence of one or more additional parts, steps or<br>
components.<br>
"Percentage" or "average" generally refers to percentages of averages by weight, unless<br>
otherwise specified or unless it is clear that another basis is meant.<br>
"GOS" or "galactooligosaccharides", or "trans-galactooligosaccharides" or "TOS" refers to<br>
oligosaccharides composed of galactose units.<br>
"Treatment and/or prevention of HIV" refers to the significant reduction or prevention of one<br>
or more of HIV infection related symptoms/dysfunctions selected from immune dysfunction,<br>
intestinal dysfunction and/or low glutathione status. In one embodiment treatment or<br>
i prevention of HIV refers to a significant reduction in (or a complete prevention of) the spread<br>
of HIV due to blockage of the DC-SIGN receptor, as will be clear from the context. A "significant reduction or prevention" refers to a reduction of the symptom (or spread of HIV) by at least 5%, 10%, 15%, 30%, 50% or even 100% compared to control subjects, not being administered the compositions according to the invention. The symptoms can be measured as known in the art, e.g. immune dysfunction can be assessed by measuring CD4+ cell counts. Blockage of the DC-SIGN receptor can be determined as in Example 1.<br>
The object of the present invention is to provide nutritional compositions suitable for treating HIV patients in order to improve their nutritional status and at least two, preferably at least three HIV related symptoms. The compositions according to the invention are particularly useful for patients with a CD4+ T cell count that is below the critical level of around 700 cells/µl blood, when generally HAART therapy is not yet needed, but when patients do<br>
already develop or experience one or more of the immune-, intestinal- and/or glutathione elated dysfunctions.<br>
Thus, the present compositions arc suitable for prevention and/or treatment of one or more of HIV infection related dysfunctions, in particular:<br>
1.	immune dysfunction, i.e. a decrease in CD4+ T cell count leading to impaired immune<br>
function;<br>
2.	intestinal dysfunction, i.e. intestinal problems, specifically HIV induced malabsorption<br>
and diarrhea; and/or<br>
3.	low glutathione status, specifically low glutathione levels in the blood and intracellularly<br>
in the T cells.<br>
In a preferred embodiment the compositions are suitable for treatment or prevention of at least immune dysfunction and low glutathione status. These compositions comprise suitable amounts of both oligosaccharides and cysteine and/or source of cysteine. In another embodiment the compositions further comprise suitable amounts of one or more PUFA(s) and/or one or more biologically active compounds and are suitable for treatment or prevention of all three of the above dysfunctions.<br>
Since CD4+ T-lymphocytes arc infected and destroyed by HIV, the progression of HIV can	<br>
be routinely and regularly monitored by measuring the CD4   T-lymphocyte count in the<br>
circulation. The initial period after infection with HIV, which can last from three to more than ten years, is characterized by a slow but gradual decline in total CD4+ T-cell counts, with no apparent symptoms of decreased resistance to infections. The first signs of infectious complications usually occur when CD4+ T cell counts are below 700 cells /ul blood. At this point, the HIV scropositivc individual may experience respiratory (coughs, colds, flu) and/or gastrointestinal (bowel discomfort, diarrhea) symptoms. These symptoms are still relatively mild and may be considered sub clinical; although bothersome to the individual, they are usually not sufficiently severe to cause hospitalization or the initiation of highly active antiretroviral treatment (HAART).<br>
One of the cell types first encountered by human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) following sexual transmission is dendritic cells (DC). DC capture HIV-1 through C-lypc lectin receptors, of which the best-studied example is DC-SIGN, which mediates HIV-1<br>
internalization. DC can keep the virus infectious for several days and are able to transmit HIV-1 to CD4(+) T cells. As is described in Example 1, the present inventors surprisingly found that oligosaccharidcs can bind to DC-SIGN.<br>
Compositions and uses accordinR to the invention<br>
The compositions according to the invention are suitable for the treatment and/or prevention<br>
of HIV and/or AIDS in a mammalian subject. The subjects are preferably human subjects<br>
infected with HIV and comprising a CD4 cell count of about 700 cell per µl blood or less,<br>
more preferably between about 200 and 700 cells per µl, e.g. between about 200 and 500<br>
cells or between about 200 and 600 or 500 and 700 cells per µl blood. In one embodiment the<br>
subjects have a CD4+ cell count of 700 or less but are not on highly active antiretroviral<br>
therapy (HAART),<br>
In one embodiment the nutritional compositions are preferably food supplements and<br>
comprise oligosaccharides and cysteine and/or source of cysteine.<br>
Oligosaccharides<br>
The compositions according to the invention comprise a thcrapeutically effective amount of oligosaccharides, preferably acid oligosaccharides and/or neutral oligosaccharides as described below.<br>
i Acid oligosaccharides comprise at least one acidic group while neutral oligosaccharides do<br>
not have such an acidic group. Dietary fibers have been extensively investigated for their health-beneficial effects. Some fibers are insoluble and non-fermentable and pass unchanged through the gut. Other fiber types may serve as prebiotics, i.e., they are used by gut bacteria and stimulate their growth. Thus, fibers such as inulin or oligosaccharidcs such as galacto-oligosaccharides (GOS) and fructo-oligosaccharides (FOS) have been documented to stimulate growth of bifidobacteria and lactic acid bacteria, which are important for a healthy gut flora.<br>
Acid oligosaccharides<br>
The term "acid oligosaccharidc(s)" refers to oligosaccharidcs comprising at least one acidic group selected from the group consisting of N-acctylncuraminic acid, N-glycoloylncuraminic acid, free or esterified carboxylic acid, sulfuric acid group and phosphoric acid group. In one embodiment the acid oligosaccharide preferably is a polyhexosc. Preferably, at least one of<br>
the aforementioned acid groups is situated at the terminal hcxosc unit of the acid oligosaccharide. Preferably the acid oligosaccharide has the structure as depicted in Fig.l, wherein the terminal hcxosc (left) preferably comprises a double bond. Preferably the acid oligosaccharide contains a carboxylic acid at the terminal hexose unit, wherein said carboxylic acid group may be free or esterified. Methods for the manufacture of esterified pectin hydrolysates that can be suitably used in the present method and composition arc provided in WO 01/60378 and/or WO 02/42484, which are hereby incorporated by reference. The hexose units other than the terminal hexose unit(s) are preferably uronic acid units, even more preferably galacturonic acid units.

Preferably, the acid oligosaccharide has one, preferably two, terminal uronic acid units, which may be free or esterified. Preferably the terminal uronic acid unit is selected from the group consisting of galacturonic acid, glucuronic acid, guluronic acid, iduronic acid, mannuronic acid, riburonic acid and alturonic acid. These units may be free or esterified. In one embodiment, the terminal hexose unit has a double bond, which is preferably situated between the C4 and C5 position of the terminal hexose unit. Preferably one of the terminal hexose units comprises the double bond. The terminal hexose (e.g. uronic acid) preferably has a structure according to Fig. 2.<br>

at least one selected  from the group consisting of R2,  R.-?,  R4 and RS represents N-<br>
acetylneuraminic acid, N-glycoloylneuraminic acid, free or esterified carboxylic acid, sulfuric<br>
acid group and phosphoric acid group, and the remaining of R2, R3, R4 and R5 representing<br>
hydroxy and/or hydrogen. Preferably one selected from the group consisting of RI, R3, R4 and B5 represents N-acetylneuraminic acid, N-glycoloylneuraminic acid, free or esterified carboxylic acid, sulfuric acid group and phosphoric acid group, and the remaining of R2, R3, R4 and Rs represent hydroxy and/or hydrogen. Even more preferably one selected from the group consisting of R?, R:,, R4 and RS represents free or esterified carboxylic acid and the remaining of R2, R3, R4 and Rs represent hydroxy and/or hydrogen; and n is an integer and refers to a number of hexose units (sec also Degree of Polymerisation, below), which may be any hexose unit. Suitably n is an integer between 1-5000 representing the number of hexose units, said hexose units preferably being uronic acid, even more preferably being galacturonic acid units. The carboxylic acid groups on these units may be free or (partly) esterified, and are preferably at least partly methylated.<br>
Most preferably, R2 and R3 represent hydroxy, R4 represent hydrogen and R5 represents free or esterified carboxylic acid.<br>
In one embodiment the compositions comprise a single type of acid oligosaccharidc (having a uniform degree of polymerization), while in another embodiment the compositions comprise a mixture of acid oligosaccharides that have different Degrees of Polymerization (DP) and/or comprise both unsaturated and saturated terminal hexose unit. Preferably at least 5%, more preferably at least 10%, even more preferably at least 25% of the terminal hexose units of the acid oligosaccharide unsaturated hexose unit (sec e.g. Fig.2). As each individual acid oligosaccharide preferably comprises only one unsaturated terminal hexose unit, preferably no more than 50% of the terminal hexose units is an unsaturated hcxose unit (i.e. comprises a double bond).<br>
A mixture of acid oligosaccharides preferably contains between 2 and 50% unsalurated hexose units based on the total amount of hexose units, preferably between 10 and 40%.<br>
The acid oligosaccharide as used in the present method has a degree of polymerisation (DP) between 1 and 5000, preferably between 1 and 1000, more preferably between 2 and 250, even more preferably between 2 and 50, most preferably between 2 and 10. If a mixture of acid oligosaccharides with different degrees of polymerisation is used, the average DP of the acid oligosaccharide mixture is preferably between 2 and 1000, more preferably between 3 and 250, even more preferably between 3 and 50. Sec also Fig.l, wherein the sum of "n" and the terminal unit (i.e. n+1) represents the degree of polymerisation. It was found that a lower DP of the oligosaccharides improves the palatability and results in a reduced viscosity<br>
product if the acid oligosaccharidc is administered in liquid form. The acid oligosaccharide may be a homogeneous or heterogeneous carbohydrate.<br>
The acid oligosaccharides used in the invention are preferably prepared from pectin, pectate, alginate, chondroitine, hyaluronic acids, heparine, heparane, bacterial carbohydrates, sialoglycans, fucoidan, fucooligosaccharides or carrageenan, preferably from pectin and/or alginate. The acid oligosaccharides may be prepared by the methods described in WO 01/60378, e.g. chemical or enzymatic hydrolysis or partial hydrolysis, see page 8 and 9, which is hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
Alginates are linear unbranched polymers containing ß-(1→ 4)-linked D-mannuronic acid and α-(l→ 4)-linked L-guluronic acid residues with a wide range of average molecular weights (100 - 100000 residues). Suitable sources of alginate include seaweeds and bacterial alginates.<br>
Pectin is divided into two main categories: high mcthoxylated pectin, which is characterised by a degree of methoxylation above 50% and low methoxylated pectin having a degree of methoxylation below 50%. As used herein, "degree of methoxylation" (also referred to as DE or "degree of esterification") is intended to mean the extent to which free carboxylic acid<br>
groups   contained   in  the  polygalacturonic   acid  chain   have   been  esterified  (e.g.  by<br>
i methylation).   The   present   acid   oligosaccharide   is   preferably   prepared   from   high<br>
methoxylated pectin.<br>
The acid oligosaccharides arc preferably characterised by a degree of methoxylation above 20%, preferably above 50 % even more preferably above 70%. Preferably the acid oligosaccharides have a degree of methylation above 20%, preferably above 50 % even more preferably above 70%.<br>
The acid oligosaccharidc(s) is/arc preferably administered in an amount of between about 10 mg and 100 gram per day, preferably between about 100 mg and 50 grams per day, even more preferably between about 0.5 and 20 gram per day.<br>
Neutral oligosaccharid.es<br>
As mentioned above, the compositions may also comprise one or more neutral oligosaccharides, either instead of or in addition to one or more acid oligosaccharides. One or more neutral oligosaccharides are selected from the group consisting of cellobiose, cellodextrins, B-cyclodextrins, indigestible dextrin, gentiooligosaccharides, glucooligo-saccharides, isomaltooligosaccharides, isomaltose, isomaltriose, panose, leucrose, palalinose, theanderose, D-agatose, D-/y,vo-hexulose, lactosucrose, a-galactooligosaccharidcs, (5-galactooligosaccharides, transgalactooligosaccharides, lactulose, 4'-galatosyllactose, synthetic galactooligosaccharide, fructans - Levan-typc, fructans - Inulin-type, 1 f-ß-fructofuranosylnystose, lacto N-tetraose, lacto N-neotetraose, xylooligosaccharide, lafmose, lactosucrose and arabinooligosaccharides.<br>
Preferably the neutral oligosaccharide is selected from the group consisting of galactooligosaccharide, fructooligosaccharide, transgalactooligosaccharide xylooligosaccharide, lactosucrose and arabinooligosaccharides. Even more preferably the neutral oligosaccharide is selected from the group consisting of galactooligosaccharide, fructooligosaccharide and transgalactooligosaccharide.<br>
Preferably the composition comprises two chemically distinct neutral oligosaccharides, one<br>
i selected from the group consisting of galactose based neutral oligosaccharide and one<br>
selected from the group of fructose and/or glucose based oligosaccharide.<br>
More preferably the composition comprises fructooligosaccharide and at least one oligosaccharide selected from transgalactooligosaccharride and galactooligosaccharide.<br>
Preferred daily amounts of neutral oligosaccharides arc between about 10 mg and 100 gram per day, preferably between about 100 mg and 50 grams per day, even more preferably between about 0.5 and 20 gram per day.<br>
Preferably a composition comprising neutral and acid oligosaccharidcs is used wherein at least 15% of the total oligosaccharides comprise of acid oligosaccharidcs more preferably between 10 and 90% and most preferably between 25 and 75%. Preferably a composition is used wherein at least 25% of the oligosaccharides are acid oligosaccharidcs comprising at least one terminal uronic acid unit.<br>
systeine or source of cysteinc<br>
The compositions provided comprise in addition to one or more oligosaccharides as described above a suitable amount of cystcinc and/or source of cysteine. The phrase "source of cysteine" refers herein to all compounds that contain a biologically available cysteine, in any form, and is calculated as the amount of cysteine amino acid that is present in a compound, or can be derived from a compound in the body after ingestion, on a molar basis.<br>
Hereinbelow "cysteine equivalent" refers to an amount of cysteine as such or to an amount of cysteine that is present in a source of cysteine. For example 100 mg NAC (N-acetylcysteine; MW= 163.2) is equivalent to 74 mg cysteine (MW 121.15). Thus 100 mg NAC is 74 mg cysteine equivalent. Similarly this can be applied to proteins or pcptides. When a peptide (MW = xDalton) contains 3 cysteine amino acids (3yDalton), than 100 mg of this peptide is equivalent to 100x3Y/X mg cysteine. Thus l00mg of this peptide is 300y/x mg cystcinc equivalent.<br>
Suitable sources of cysteine according to the invention arc, for example, proteins in denatured and/or undenatured form such as milk proteins e.g. whey or casein proteins. Egg proteins are rich in cysteine and are therefore also suitable. Plant proteins such as pea, potato, soy and rice<br>
can also be used to provide cystcinc. Also hydrolysates of these protein sources can be used<br>
i or fractions enriched for cysteine rich proteins or peptides (e.g. as described in EP1201137).<br>
Furthermore, synthetic cysteine equivalents, e.g. derivatives of cysteine, such as cystcinc, cysteine salts, N-acetylcysteine and/or diacetylcysteinc can be used.<br>
The HIV infected subjects are suitably administered a daily dose of at least about 100 mg cysteine equivalent, preferably at least about 200, 400, or 600 mg cysteine equivalent per day, more preferably at least about 1000 mg cysteinc equivalent per day.

Such glutathione level stimulating compounds may be used in addition to cysteine but also instead of cysleinc.<br><br>
In another embodiment the compositions comprising one or more oligosaccharides and systeine and/or source of cysteine further comprise one or more PUFAs and/or one or more biologically active compounds, such as compounds found in milk or probiotic microorganisms.<br>
Probiotic micro-organism<br>
Probiotic micro-organism means a micro-organism which beneficially affects a HIV patient by improving its intestinal microbial balance (Fuller, R. J. Applied Bacteriology, 1989;66:365-378). The probiotic micro-organism may be selected from one or more microorganisms suitable for human consumption and which is able to improve the microbial balance in the intestine. Preferably, the present composition contains 104 to 1012, more preferably from 105 to 10", most preferably from 107 to 5xl010 colony forming units (cfu) of probiotic bacteria per gram uronic acid oligosaccharide with a DP between 2 and 100. The present composition preferably contains 102 to 1013 colony forming units (cfu) of probiotic bacteria per gram dry weight of the present composition, preferably 104 to 1012, more preferably 105 to 1010, most preferably from 105 to IxlO9 cfu. The dosage of probiotic bacteria according to the present invention is preferably between 102 to 1013, more preferably from 105 to 1011, most preferably from 10s to 5xl010 colony forming units (cfu) per day. Preferably live or viable bacteria arc used, but dead bacteria or bacterial fragments may also<br>
be used.<br>
Preferably the present composition comprises bacteria of the genus Lactobacillus and/or Bifidobacterium. Preferably the composition comprises a Bifidobacterium selected from the group consisting of B. longum, B.breve and B. bifidum and/or a Lactobacillus selected from the group consisting of L. casei, L paracasei, L. rhamnosus, L. acidophilus and L. plantarum. Most preferably the present composition comprises Bifidobacterium breve and/or Lactobacillus paracasei.<br>
Bifidobacterium breve is a Gram-positive, anaerobic, rod-shaped bacterium. The present B. breve preferably has at least 95 % nucleic acid sequence identity of the 16 S rRNA sequence when compared to the type strain of B. breve ATCC 15700, more preferably at least 97%, 98%, 99% or more sequence identity as defined in Stackcbrandt &amp; Goebcl, 1994, Int. J. Sysl. Bacteriol. 44:846-849. Nucleic acid sequence identity is calculated for two nuclcolidc sequences, when optimally aligned, using the programs GAP or BESTFIT using default<br>
parameters. The GAP default parameters are used, with a gap creation penalty = 50 (nucleotides) / 8 (proteins) and gap extension penalty - 3 (nuclcotides) / 2 (proteins). For nucleotides the default scoring matrix used is nwsgapdna (Hcnikoff &amp; Henikoff, 1992, PNAS 89, 915-919). It is clear than when RNA sequences are said to be essentially similar or have a certain degree of sequence identity with DNA sequences, thymine (T) in the DNA sequence is considered equal to uracil (U) in the RNA sequence. Sequence alignments and scores for percentage sequence identity may be determined using computer programs, such as the GCG Wisconsin Package, Version 10.3, available from Accelrys Inc., 9685 Scranton Road, San Diego, CA 92121-3752, USA or EMBOSSwin v. 2.10.0.

Hansen, Denmark), LMG 12165 and LMG 11407.<br>
Polvunsaturated fatty acids:<br>
The present inventors found that eicosapcntacnoic acid (EPA, n-3) and gamma linolcnic acid (GLA, n-6) effectively reduce inflammatory mediated intestinal tight junction permeability. Hence a composition, suitable for improving intestinal barrier integrity is provided, which comprises (in addition to oligosaccharides and cysteine and/or source of cystcinc) EPA and/or GLA. Based on the biochemical pathways it can be hypothesized that also other<br>
combinations of fatty acids are also effective. Thus, compositions comprising one or more other PUFAs or mixtures thereof are also provided. For example a mixture of any of EPA, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, n-3), dihomo-gamma linolenic acid (DGLA, C20:3n-6), stearidonic acid (STA, C18:4n-4), alpha linolenic acid (ALA, C18:3n-3), (docosapentaenoic acid (DPA, C22:5n-3), eicosatetranoic acid (C20:4n-3) and/or arachidonic acid (AA, n-6) may be used.<br>
Suitably a relatively high daily dose of the polyunsaturated fatty acids is used. In one embodiment at least about 25 en%, preferably at least about 30 en%, more preferably at least about 35 en% of a fat blend comprising n-3 and/or n-6 fatty acids is used (en% is short for energy percentage and represents the relative amount each constituent contributes to the total caloric value of the preparation). Preferred daily amounts are at least 1 gram PUFA, more preferably between 1-50 gram PUFA, more preferably between 5 and 25 gram PUFA and most preferred is an amount between 7.5 and 15 gram PUFA.<br>
An optimal fat blend may e.g. comprise 40% borage oil and 60% fish oil. The n-3/n-6 fatty acid ratio is then between 1-2 and the weight percentage of n-3 is between 20-40, and of n-6 is between 15-35 of total fatty acid content. Borage oil can partly or completely be replaced by evening primrose oil.<br>
Therefore preferred daily amounts are at least 0.1 gram EPA and 0.05 gram GLA, more preferably between 0.1 and 5 gram EPA and between 0.05 and 2.5 gram GLA, more preferably between 0.5 and 2.5 gram EPA and between 0.25 and 1.25 gram GLA and most preferred is an amount between 0.75 and 1.5 gram EPA and between 0.37 and 0.75 gram GLA.<br>
Biologically active ingredients<br>

A. Growth factors<br>
11 has been found that milk growth factors arc beneficial for gut health. Transforming growth<br>
factor-beta, insulin like growth factor and kcratinocyte growth factors are the most important<br>
examples of milk growth factors. Therefore, in one embodiment the compositions further comprise one or more growth factors, e.g. about 1-500µg growth factors per day.<br>
B.	Immunoglobulins<br>
Immunoglobulins have been shown to protect against intestinal infections and the compositions according to the invention suitably comprise a daily dose from 0,1 to lOg Immunoglobulins<br>
C.	Other ingredients<br>
Other bioactive ingredients obtainable from milk e.g. nucleotides, fatty acids, oligosaccharides were also found to have a beneficial effect on the gut barrier function and may therefore be suitably used in the manufacture of the compositions.<br>
D.	Colostrum<br>
In one embodiment the compositions comprise Colostrum. Colostrum is the prc-milk fluid secreted by the mammary glands of mammalian mothers after giving birth, in particular cows after calving. Colostrum contains many biologically active milk ingredients and is therefore an excellent source of biologically active molecules. Colostrum, being a protein source, has the additional advantage of providing cysteine. For having beneficial effects in HIV patients at least about 5 gram colostrum are provided on a daily basis, preferably at least about 10<br>
gram, more preferably at least about 20 g per day or more.<br><br>
Extracts from milk proteins, such as a whey growth factor extract as described in EP0545946 or a casein extract as described in WO02083164, immunoglobulin concentrates, lactoferrin or other concentrated whey fractions can also be used to improve the gut barrier function of HIV patients.<br>
It is understood that the biologically active molecules or components may be obtained using a range of methods. Many are commercially available, or can be made synthetically, by recombinant DNA technology or they can be (partially) purified or extracted from natural sources such as milk. Also mixtures of any of the biologically active molecules or components comprising these molecules may be used.<br>
Compositions suitable for blocking DC-sign receptors<br>
In another embodiment compositions suitable for the treatment and/or prevention of DC-sign mediated diseases, such as HIV or AIDS, are provided.
