				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of trans-4-amino-1-cyclohexanecarboxilic acid derivatives which are useful as intermediates of medicaments such as NPYY5 receptor antagonists and the like.<br>
Background Art<br>
Trans-4-amino-l-cyclohexanecarboxilic acid derivatives are useful as intermediates of medicament etc.   For example, trans-4-(2-methylpropane-2-sulfonylamino)cyclohexanecarboxylic acid and the like are disclosed as intermediates of NPYY5 receptor antagonists in the following Patent Literature 1.    However, an isolation yield of the trans isomer is only 40% by the process described in the literature because the cis isomer does not smoothly isomerize to the trans isomer even if it is reacted for many hours.   Therefore, the process is not necessarily satisfying as a process for a mass-production of the trans isomer.<br>
A development of a convenient process for the preparation of trans-4-amino-l-cyclohexanecarboxylic acid has been desired in order to efficiently mass-produce various trans isomers of amino derivatives and/or carboxyl derivatives from 4-amino-1-cyclohexane carboxylic acid.<br>

Therefore, the above Compound (VII) and Compound (VIII) are also useful as intermediates.<br><br>
(Step 1)<br>
Compound (X) is obtained by reacting Compound (IX) with Compound (V), if desired, in the presence of a base.   This step may be performed according to the above-mentioned step for synthesis of Compound (HIT) from Compound (IV).<br><br>

The amount of a catalyst is preferably about 0.01 to 0.05 mole equivalent relative to Compound (X11).   The amount of a peroxide is preferably about 1.0 to 2.0 mole equivalents relative to Compound (XM).<br>

same as defined above. (Step 1)<br>
In this step, if desired, Compound (IX') is protected by a protective group R to give Compound (IX"), i.e., a protected trans cyclohexane carboxylic acid compound. If the next reaction is not influenced by the substituents, a protective group R need not to be introduced and a free carboxylic acid compound may be subjected to Step 2.<br>
A carboxyl-protective group is not limited as long as it is usually used and Examples are methyl, ethyl, t-butyl, phenyl, benzyl and triphenylmethyl.   If methyl is used as a protective group, Compound (IX") can be obtained by reacting Compound (IX*) with a thionyl chloride in methanol.<br>

Thus obtained product may be isolated or purified, and the product without isolation or purification may be subjected to the next step.   The use of the product without isolation or purification is advantageous because the next step can be continuously performed.<br><br>
(Step 2)<br>
In this step, Compound (X") is obtained by reacting Compound (IX") with Compound (V) and a base.<br>
Reaction conditions are the same as those in the above Process 3, Stepl. (Step 3)<br>
In this step, Compound (I") is obtained by oxidizing Compound (X")-<br>
Reaction conditions are the same as those in the above Process 3, Step 2.<br>
Thus-obtained product may be isolated or purified.   The product without isolation or purification may be subjected to the next step.   The use without isolation or purification is advantageous because the next step can be continuously performed.<br>
Compound (I") wherein R is hydrogen need not to be subjected to the next step and can be converted to Compound (XII) according to Process 5 mentioned below. (Step 4)<br>
In this step, Compound (P) is obtained by deprotective Compound (I,!) wherein R is a carboxyl-protective group.<br>
It is preferred to use an appropriate reagent to deprotect the protective group introduced in Step 1.<br>
For example, when methyl is used as a protective group, Compound (I") may be reacted with a base such as sodium methoxide and water.   The amount of a base is preferably about 2.0 to 3.0 mole equivalent relative to Compound (I").<br>
Any solvent can be used provided that it can dissolve or suspend a reaction substrate to give a reactive solution or slurry.<br>
