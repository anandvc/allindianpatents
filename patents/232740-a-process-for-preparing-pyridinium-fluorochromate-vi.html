				<td>PROCESS FOR PREPARING PYRIDINIUM FLUOROCHROMATE<br>
(VI)<br>
Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to a process for preparing high quality pyridinium fluorochromate (VI) (PFC). More particularly, the present invention relates to a novel, economic and environmentally clean process for pyridinium salt of fluorotrioxo-chromate (VI), PFC, having the chemical formula C5H5NH[CrC3F], by direct reaction of stoichiometric amounts of hydrofluoric acid, chromium trioxide and pyridine demonstrating approximately 100% atom economy. Background of the invention<br>
Partial oxidations of organic substrates have always been commercially very important and for this purpose no other reagent could be as popular, as useful and as successful as the chromium (VI) reagents have been. Though there are some limitations of chromium reagents in terms of environmental antagonism, the_ popularity of such reagents does not seem to diminish because their performance under mild conditions with high efficiency and cost-effectiveness weigh far over their limitations. Thus, chromium (VI) based oxidizing agents have been extensively worked on leading to the development of a good number of reagents, many of which have become quite popular and performing well as oxidizing agents. Some of the important entries in the list of chromium (VI) reagents are the Collin's reagent, chromium-trioxide-3,5-dimethyl-pyrazole complex, pyridinium chlorochromate (PCC), pyridinium fluorochromate (PFC), pyridinium dichromate (PDC), quinolinium fluorochromate (QFC) and 2,2'-bipyridinium chlorochromate (BiPCC). In addition, there are a few other systems which work as reagents in combination with chromium (VI), e.g., chromium (VI)-t-butylhydroperoxide, chromium (VI)-peroxocarbonate and chromium (VI)-peroxoborate.<br>
Pyridinium fluorochromate (PFC), in addition to being a vital reagent for several biochemically important syntheses, is a highly efficient oxidant for a wide variety of oxidative organic transformations. As oxidant, it is widely used in the oxidation of alcohols, hydroxy acids, allylic, benzylic, substituted toluenes, fused ring hydrocarbons, organic sulfides, benzyl ethers, phosphorus compounds, thioacids, substituted mandelic acids, oxidative der- .ction of oximes and desilylative<br><br>
oxidation of alkyl trimethylsilyl ethers. PFC also acts as a very powerful oxo transfer agent such as conversion of PPhsto OPPhs.<br>
PFC successfully exercises its role as an imperative reagent for the synthesis of hydroxy ethylene, ketomethylene dipeptide isosteres, S-(+)-4-Formyl-4-Butanolide, (R)-l-benzoyloxy-3-buten-2-ol, derivatives of dimethyl penam and dimethyl penam-S, S-dioxide, sex pheromones of pink bollworm. Yet another manifestation of its versatility stems from its use for the investigations of a wide variety of reaction dynamics. Thus for instance PFC has been widely used in the kinetics and mechanistic studies of the reactions discussed above.<br>
Pyridinium fluorochromate, often referred to as PFC is well known in the art as witnessed for example by its well deserved incorporation in the Encyclopedia of Reagents for Organic Synthesis, L. A. Paquette (Ed. in chief), 1995, Vol. 6, p. 4369, John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York and Reagents for Organic Synthesis, M. Fieser, 1984, Vol. 11, p. 453, John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York. Reference is made to Synthesis, 1982, 588; Bull. Chem. Soc. Jpn., 1984, 57, 2019 and Inorg. Synth. 1990, 27, 310 wherein chromium trioxide is dissolved in water and aqueous hydrofluoric acid and to the solution pyridine is added. The solution is then heated to yield the crystals of PFC. The disadvantages of the procedure are the use of an excess of hydrofluoric acid and necessity of heating. Reference is made to J. Fluorine Chem., 1997, 81, 211; wherein ammonium bifluoride (NFLjFfl^) is dissolved in water followed by the addition of CrOs and to the clear orange solution pyridine is added. The clear orange solution is heated to yield the crystals of PFC. The disadvantage of the procedure is that the product is formed in very poor yield. Extra preparation of NRtHFa is required adding to a relatively high cost of production. Objects of the invention<br>
The main object of the invention is to provide an economic, environmentally benign, and energy efficient process for the preparation of pyridinium fluorochromate, PFC which is a highly useful oxidant.<br>
Another object of the invention is to provide a process for the preparation of pyridinium flurochromate which avoids the use of excess hydrofluoric acid or pyridine.<br>

dissolved in minimal amounts of water to avoid any loss due to solubility of the product.<br>

It is a further object of the invention to provide a process for the preparation of pyridinium fluorochromate wherein 100% of atom economy is obtained, with no chromium waste being produced.<br>
It is another object of the invention to provide a process for the preparation of pyridinium fluorochromate by a facile reaction wherein no extra steps like filtration or centrifugation are needed for isolation of the compound, the reaction is operationally simple and environmentally benign.<br>
It is further objeqt of the invention to provide a process for the preparation of pyridinium fluorochromate wherein the product is stable, has long shelf life, is obtained in quantitative yield, is substantially pure and crystalline without requiring recrystallization.<br>

The novelty of the present invention lies in the design and development of an improved process for pyridinium fluorochromate comprising the reaction of chromouim(VI) oxide, hydrofluoric acid and pyridine to afford the product approximately with 100% of atom economy. The product is very stable and cost effective. The fluoride ion does not leach during the reaction to cause the corrosion of the glass vessel used. No extraneous heating is required because the fluorotrioxochromate(VI) complex on interaction with pyridine, an exothermic reaction sets in. The reduction of the water content devoid of extraneous heating for the reaction enables 100% atom economy. The autoheating and solubility factors play vital role to achieve such unprecedented atom economy. The increasing use of PFC as a versatile oxidant attests to its credibility as a popular reagent. This reagent has not only survived the test of time but also been continuously showing newer applications.<br><br>
It is highly encouraging to see the width of the spectrum of the reagent. Thus as has been mentioned elsewhere, the reagent can be used for a wide variety of diverse organic transformations.<br>
The process of the present invention comprises the reaction between chromouim(VI) oxide, hydrofluoric acid and pyridine to obtain pyridinium fluorochromate VI (PFC) in quantitative yields and with approximately with 100% of atom economy. The basic mechanism of the reaction comprises the reaction of chromium(VI) oxide with preferably 48% hydrofluoric acid to yield a fluorotrioxochromate(VI) complex. The fluorotrioxochromate(VI) complex is preferably dissolved using minimum amount of water to avoid any loss due to solubility of the product. In the alternate, the fluorotrioxochromate(VI) complex interacts directly with pyridine preferably at ice - cold conditions to obtain pyridinium fluorochromate, PFC. 40% hydrofluoric acid can also be used instead of 48% HF. no excess of hydrofluoric acid is used. Use of excess pyridine is avoided.<br>
No extraneous heating is required because the fluorotrioxochromate(VI) complex on interaction with pyridine, an exothermic reaction sets in. the above protocol demonstrates approximately 100% of atom economy. Significantly, waste such as chromium waste is not produced since the reaction proceeds with almost 100 % atom economy. The reaction is facile and no hydrofluoric acid is allowed to escape to the atmosphere, since all of it is made to react. Extra steps like filtration or centrifugation are not needed for isolation of the compound. The product obtained is observed to be substantially pure and crystalline and does not require further crystallization. PFC obtained is also very stable and has a long shelf life. Scientific explanation<br>
Development of Pyridinium fluorochromate is essential to overcome the practical difficulties in use of pyridinium chlorochromate, PCC, which is unfortunately quite unstable, and also many other chromium (VI) reagents. The invention resides in the discovery that replacement of Cl by F to coordinate with the Cr(VI) centre would enhance the stability of the resultant compound in addition to increasing its potential as oxidant. This is because oxidation of F~ to Vi p2, unlike Cl" to '/2 Ch, is not possible by the metal, whereas the higher electronegativity of the fluoride ion contributes to the enhancement fhe electron transfer ability of the reagent. Another contributing factor to the lability of the reagent is the high propensity of fluoride to react with higher valent metal to form a stable species<br><br>
(HSAB concept). Thus, in a typical protocol, in the reaction between CrO3 and hydrofluoric acid, chromium (VI) oxide first reacts with F~ ion, in an acidic medium, to form the distorted tetrahedral fluorotrioxo-chromate(VI), CrO3F~ ion, which is then precipitated by the counter cation CsHsNH* (PyH+), obtained by the addition of pyridine in the acidic medium. Notably in the previous method (Synthesis 1982, 588) a higher amount of hydrofluoric acid, than what is actually required is used. This procedure has been used world wide for the preparation of the reagent. However, the use of a relatively higher amount of HF is a matter of concern.<br>
 (Figure Removed) The goal of the present invention is to prepare pyridinium fluorochromate(VI) by a novel, economic and environmentally favourable improved process. The requirement of only one equivalent of fluoride and one equivalent of H* ion, with HF having no other role in the process, prompted investigation into the application of the atom economic principle to achieve the goal. Since CsHsNHfCrOsF] (PFC) is soluble in water, investigation was done to ascertain whether a higher yield could be obtained by the use of lesser amount of water and whether the use of a lesser amount of water would allow a relatively strong inter ionic interaction thereby making the reaction effectively more exothermic which in turn would render the extraneous heating redundant.<br>
(Figure Removed)The following example is given by way illustration and therefore should not be construed to limit the scope of the invention.<br>
Example 1 Synthesis of pyridnium fluorochromate<br>
A sample of chromium(VI) oxide, CrOs (ISOmmol, 15 .Og) was taken in a 250mL polythene beaker and 48% hydrofluoric acid , HF (ISOmmol, 6.253mL) was added drop wise with continuous stirring with a Teflon rod. The stirring was continued for 8-10min. This exercise was followed by drop wise addition of 9mL of water under stirring over a period of 15min leading to a clear orange colored solution. The whole was cooled in a ice-water bath for 15min and distilled pyridine (150.02mmol, 12.11mL) was added drop wise to this solution with vigorous stirring. A highly exothermic reaction set in leading almost instantaneously to the formation of bright orange crystals of pyridinium fluorochromate, PFC. The whole was allowed to stand first in ice-water bath for 30min and then at room temperature for 30min. The compound was washed twice with hexane. The product was finally dried in vacua over cone. H2SO4 or fused CaCl2 Yield: 29.63g (99.2%); Melting Point: 106-107 °C. The chemical analyses, IR and X-ray studies of the compound match with those reported in literature. Analytical data: The compound analyzed correctly as<br>
