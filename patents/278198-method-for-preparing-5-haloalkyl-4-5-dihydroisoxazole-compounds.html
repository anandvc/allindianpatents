DETAILS OF THE INVENTION<br>
As used herein, the terms "comprises," "comprising," "includes," "including," "has," "having" or any other variation thereof, are intended to cover a non-exclusive inclusion. For example, a composition, process, method, article, or apparatus that comprises a list of elements is not necessarily limited to only those elements but may include other elements not expressly listed or inherent to such composition, process, method, article, or apparatus. Further, unless expressly stated to the contrary, "or" refers to an inclusive or and not to an exclusive or. For example, a condition A or B is satisfied by any one of the following: A is true (or present) and B is false (or not present), A is false (or not present) and B is true (or present), and both A and B are true (or present).<br>
Also, the indefinite articles "a" and "an" preceding an element or component of the invention are intended to be nonrestrictive regarding the number of instances (i.e. occurrences) of the element or component. Therefore "a" or "an" should be read to include one or at least one, and the singular word form of the element or component also includes the plural unless the number is obviously meant to be singular.<br>
Ratios arc generally recited herein as single numbers, which are relative to the number 1; for example, a ratio of 4 means 4:1. The term "equivalent ratio" refers to the number of equivalents of one component (e.g., of a base) relative to another component added to a reaction mixture, recognizing that some compounds may provide two or more equivalents per mole.<br>
In the present disclosure and claims, the radical "SO2"means sulfonyl, "-CN" means cyano, "-NO2" means nitro, and "-OH" means hydroxyl.<br>
In the above recitations, the term "alkyl", used either alone or in compound words such as "alkylthio" or "haloalkyl" includes straight-chain or branched alkyl, such as, methyl.<br>
ethyl, n-propyl, i-propyl, or the different butyl, pentyl or hexyl isomers. "Alkenyl" includes straight-chain or branched alkenes such as ethenyl, 1-propenyl, 2-propenyl, and the different butenyl, pentenyl and hexenyl isomers. "Alkenyl" also includes polyenes such as 1,2-propadienyl and 2,4-hexadienyl. "Alkynyl" includes straight-chain or branched alkynes such as ethynyl, 1-propynyl, 2-propynyl and the different butynyl, pentynyl and hexynyl isomers. "Alkynyl" can also include moieties comprised of multiple triple bonds such as 2,5-hexadiynyl.<br>
"Alkoxy" includes, for example, methoxy, ethoxy, n-propyloxy, isopropyloxy and the different butoxy, pentoxy and hexyloxy isomers. "Alkylthio" includes branched or straight-chain alkylthio moieties such as methylthio, ethylthio, and the different propylthio, butylthio, pentylthio and hexylthio isomers. "Alkylsulfinyl" includes both enantiomers of an alkylsulfinyl group. Examples of "alkylsulfinyl" include CH3S(=O)-, CH3CH2S(=O)-, CH3CH2CH2S(=O)-, (CH3)2CHS(=O)- and the different butylsulfinyl, pentylsulfmyl and hexylsulfmyl isomers. Examples of "alkylsulfonyl" include CH3SO2-, CH3CH2SO2-, CH3CH2CH2SO2-, (CH3)2CHSO2-, and the different butylsulfonyl, pentylsulfonyl and hexylsulfonyl isomers.<br>
"Cycloalkyl" includes, for example, cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl and cyclohexyl. The term "alkylcycloalkyl" denotes alkyl substitution on a cycloalkyl moiety and includes, for example, ethylcyclopropyl, i-propylcyclobutyl, 3-methylcyclopentyl and 4-methylcyclohexyl. The term "cycloalkylalkyl" denotes cycloalkyl substitution on an alkyl moiety. Examples of "cycloalkylalkyl" include cyclopropylmethyl, cyclopentylethyl, and other cycloalkyl moieties bonded to straight-chain or branched alkyl groups.<br>
The term "halogen", either alone or in compound words such as "haloalkyl", or when<br>
used in descriptions such as "alkyl substituted with halogen" includes fluorine, chlorine,<br>
bromine or iodine. Further, when used in compound words such as "haloalkyl", or when<br>
used in descriptions such as "alkyl substituted with halogen" said alkyl may be partially or<br>
fully substituted with halogen atoms which may be the same or different. Examples of<br>
"haloalkyl" or "alkyl substituted with halogen" include F3C-, C1CH2-, CF3CH2- and<br>
CF3CC12-. The terms "haloalkoxy" and "haloalkylthio" and the like, are defined<br>
analogously to the term "haloalkyl". Examples of "haloalkoxy" include CF3O-,<br>
CC13CH2O-, HCF2CH2CH2O- and CF3CH2O-. Examples of "haloalkylthio" include<br>
CC13S-, CF3S-, CC13CH2S- and C1CH2CH2CH2S-. Examples of "haloalkylsulfinyl" include<br>
CF3S(=O)-,     CC13S(=O)-,     CF3CH2S(=O)-     and    CF3CF2S(=O)-.	Examples    of<br>
"haloalkylsulfonyl" include CF3SO2-, CC13SO2-, CF3CH2SO2- and CF3CF2SO2-.<br>
"Alkylcarbonyl" denotes a straight-chain or branched alkyl moieties bonded to a C(=O) moiety. Examples of "alkylcarbonyl" include CH3C(=O)-, CH3CH2CH2C(=O)- and (CH3)2CHC(=O)-. Examples of "alkoxycarbonyl" include CH3OC(=O)-, CH3CH2OC(=O)-,<br>
CH3CH2CH2OC(=O)-,   (CH3)2CHOC(=O)-   and   the   different   butoxy-,   pentoxy-,   or hexoxycarbonyl isomers.<br>
The total number of carbon atoms in a substituent group is indicated by the "Ci-Cj" prefix where i and j are numbers from 1 to 7. For example, C1-C4 alkylsulfonyl designates methylsulfonyl through butylsulfonyl.<br>
When a compound is substituted with a substituent bearing a subscript that indicates the number of said substituents can exceed 1, said substituents (when they exceed 1) are independently selected from the group of defined substituents, e.g., (Rv)r in U-1 of Exhibit 1 wherein v is 0, 1,2, 3, 4 or 5. As (Rv)r are optional substituents on rings in Exhibits 1 and 2, Q-A and Q-B respectively, each may substitute any available carbon or nitrogen ring member(s) of the rings. When a variable group is shown to be optionally attached to a position, for example (Rv)r wherein v may be 0, then hydrogen may be at the position even if not recited in the variable group definition. When one or more positions on a group are said to be "not substituted" or "unsubstituted", then hydrogen atoms are attached to take up any free valency.<br>
The term "heterocyclic ring" denotes a ring in which at least one atom forming the ring backbone is not carbon, e.g., nitrogen, oxygen or sulfur. Typically a heterocyclic ring contains no more than 4 nitrogens, no more than 2 oxygens and no more than 2 sulfurs. Unless otherwise indicated, a heterocyclic ring can be a saturated, partially unsaturated, or fully unsaturated ring. The term "unsaturated heterocyclic ring" relates to both partially and fully unsaturated rings. When a fully unsaturated heterocyclic ring satisfies Huckel's rule, then said ring is also called a "heteroaromatic ring" or "aromatic heterocyclic ring". Unless otherwise indicated, heterocyclic rings can be attached through any available carbon or nitrogen by replacement of a hydrogen on said carbon or nitrogen. A "heterocyclic ring" may optionally contain ring members selected from the group C(=O), C(=S), S(=O) and SO2. The term "ring member" refers to any atom or other moiety (e.g., C(=O), C(=S), S(=O) or SO2) forming the backbone of a ring.<br>
"Aromatic" indicates that each of the ring atoms is essentially in the same plane and has a p-orbital perpendicular to the ring plane, and in which (4p + 2) n electrons, where p is a positive integer, are associated with the ring to comply with Huckel's rule.<br>
As is generally known in the art, the chemical name "pyridyl" is synonymous with "pyridinyl".<br>
The term "optionally substituted" is used herein interchangeably with the phrase "substituted or unsubstituted" or with the term "(un)substituted". Unless otherwise indicated, an optionally substituted group may have a substituent at each substitutable position of the group, and each substitution is independent of the other. An optionally substituted group also may have no substitucnts. Therefore the phrase "optionally substituted with one or more substituents" means that the number of substitucnts may vary<br>
from zero up to the number of available positions for substitution. Similarly the phrase "optionally substituted with 1-5 substituents" means that the number of substituents may vary from zero up to the number of available position but not exceeding 5.<br>
Each X is independently C1 or F.   Thus, for example, CHX2 could be CHCl2, CHCF2 or CHC1F.<br>
When Q1 or Q2 is a nitrogen-containing heterocyclic ring it may be attached to the remainder of Formula 1 though any available carbon or nitrogen ring atom, unless otherwise described. As noted above, Q1 and Q2 can be (among others) phenyl optionally substituted with one or more substituents selected from a group of substituents as defined in the Summary of Invention. An example of phenyl optionally substituted with one to five substituents is the ring illustrated as U-l in Exhibit 1, wherein Rv is the optional substituents as defined in the Summary of the Invention for Q1 and Q2 and r is an integer from 0 to 5.<br>
As noted above, Q1 and Q2 can be a 5- or 6-membered heterocyclic ring, which may be saturated or unsaturated, optionally substituted with one or more substituents selected from a group of substituents as defined in the Summary of Invention. Examples of a 5- or 6-membered aromatic unsaturated heterocyclic ring optionally substituted with one or more substituents include the rings U-2 through U-61 illustrated in Exhibit 1 wherein Rv is any substituent as defined in the Summary of the Invention for Q1 and Q2 and r is an integer from 0 to 4, limited by the number of available positions on each U group. As U-29, U-30, U-36, U-37, U-38, U-39, U-40, U-41, U-42 and U-43 have only one available position, for these U groups r is limited to the integers 0 or 1, and r being 0 means that the U group is unsubstiruted and a hydrogen is present at the position indicated by (Rv)r.<br>
Exhibit 1<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
Note that when Q1 or Q2 is a 5- or 6-membered saturated or non-aromatic unsaturated heterocyclic ring optionally substituted with one or more substituents selected from the group of substituents as defined in the Summary of Invention for Q1 and Q2, one or two carbon ring members of the heterocycle can optionally be in the oxidized form of a carbonyl moiety.<br>
Examples of a 5- or 6-membered saturated or non-aromatic unsaturated heterocyclic ring include the rings G-1 through G-35 as illustrated in Exhibit 2. Note that when the attachment point on the G group is illustrated as floating, the G group can be attached to the remainder of Formula 1 through any available carbon or nitrogen of the G group by replacement of a hydrogen atom. The optional substituents corresponding to Rv can be attached to any available carbon or nitrogen by replacing a hydrogen atom. For these G rings, r is typically an integer from 0 to 4, limited by the number of available positions on each G group.<br>
Note that when Q1 and Q2 comprise a ring selected from G-28 through G-35, G2 is selected from O, S or N. Note that when G2 is N, the nitrogen atom can complete its valence by substitution with either H or the substituents corresponding to Rv as defined in the Summary of Invention for Q1 and Q2.<br>

Scheme 1<br>
(Scheme Removed)<br>
As shown in Scheme 1, according to the method of this invention a compound of Formula 2 is contacted with hydroxylamine and a base to form a 5-haloalkyl-4,5-dihydroisoxazolc compound of Formula 1.<br>
Hydroxylamine can be generated from a mineral acid salt such as hydroxylamine sulfate or hydroxylamine chloride by treatment with a base in a suitable solvent, or can be obtained commercially as 50% aqueous solution. In this method before contact with an enone of Formula 2, hydroxylamine or a mineral acid salt thereof is typically contacted with a base. When a mineral acid salt of hydroxylamine is used, the base is contacted in an amount in excess of the amount needed to convert the hydroxylamine mineral acid salt to hydroxylamine. Base is not consumed in the reaction of Scheme 1, and appears to act as a catalyst for the desired cyclization. Deprotonation of the hydroxylamine with a base prior to contact with an enone of Formula 2 is necessary to obtain good yields, because in the absence of base the reaction of hydroxylamine with enones can afford products other than compounds of Formula 2. Therefore although often about one molar equivalent of base (in addition to any base used to convert a hydroxylamine mineral acid salt to hydroxylamine) is used relative to hydroxylamine, less than one molar equivalent of base can give excellent results. More than one molar equivalent (e.g., up to about 5 molar equivalents) of base relative to hydroxylamine can be used, provided that the excess base does not react with the enone of Formula 2 or the isoxazole of Formula 1.<br>
A molar excess of one to three equivalents of hydroxylamine relative to the enone of Formula 2 can be used. To ensure the cost-effective, complete, and expeditious conversion of the enone of Formula 2 to the isoxazole of Formula 1, in a manner suitable for large-scale production, between about one and about two molar equivalents of hydroxylamine relative to the enone of Formula 2 is typically found to be most suitable<br>
Suitable bases can include, but are not limited to, alkali metal alkoxides such as sodium methoxide, alkali metal carbonates such as sodium carbonate or potassium carbonate, alkali metal hydroxides such as sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide, and organic bases. Preferred organic bases are amine bases having at least one pair of free electrons available for protonation such as pyridine, triethylamine or N,N-diisopropylethylamine. Weaker bases such as pyridine can be used, but stronger bases which efficiently deprotonate hydroxylamine, such as an alkali metal alkoxide or an alkali metal hydroxide, typically provide better results. Because water is an especially useful solvent for deprotonating hydroxylamine, as well as forming hydroxylamine from its salts, bases compatible with water are of particular note. Examples of strong bases that are soluble and compatible with water are alkali metal hydroxides. Sodium hydroxide is preferred, because it is inexpensive and works well for deprotonating hydroxylamine, thereby forming the sodium salt of hydroxylamine in aqueous solution. Alkali metal alkoxides are frequently used in solution in a lower alkanol, often the alkanol corresponding to the alkoxide.<br>
The method of Scheme 1 is conducted in the presence of a suitable solvent. For best results the solvent should be inert to the base and hydroxylamine, and should be capable of dissolving the enone of Formula 2. Suitable organic solvents include alcohols, ethers, nitriles or aromatic hydrocarbons. Water-miscible solvents such as alcohols (e.g., methanol, isopropanol), ethers (e.g., tetrahydrofuran) or nitriles (e.g., acetonitrile) work well with alkali metal hydroxide bases. Solvents which are non-nucleophilic (e.g., ethers and nitriles) often provide the best results. Particularly when a single solvent is used, the most preferred solvents are tetrahydrofuran and acetonitrile.<br>
Alternatively it may be more desirable to conduct the reaction using a mixture of two solvents formed by contacting a solution of the enone of Formula 2 in a solvent such as tetrahydrofuran or acetonitrile with a solution of hydroxylamine and a base such as sodium hydroxide in a second solvent, which acts as the co-solvent in the solvent mixture. Water is particularly useful as a co-solvent, because mineral acid salts of hydroxylamine and alkali metal hydroxide bases such as sodium hydroxide are particularly soluble in water. The rapid generation of hydroxylamine from its mineral acid salt and subsequent deprotonation of hydroxylamine facilitated by water, and the solubility and stability of the deprotonated species in water are especially desirable. In large-scale production, solutions rather than slurries are preferred, because they are easier to handle and transfer in process equipment. When water is the co-solvent, the other solvent is typically a water-miscible solvent such as tetrahydrofuran or acetonitrile.<br>
Other highly polar, hydroxylic solvents such as lower alkanols (e.g., methanol, ethanol) are also particularly useful as co-solvents, because like water they readily dissolve mineral acid salts of hydroxylamine and alkali metal hydroxides. Lower alkanols can give better results than water as a co-solvent when the other solvent is not water-miscible, e.g.,<br>
tert-butyl methyl ether. When a lower alkanol is used as a co-solvent, particularly with another solvent that is not water-miscible, the base added is often an alkali metal alkoxide instead of an alkali metal hydroxide.<br>
As long as base is present to deprotonate hydroxylamine, the hydroxylamine, the base and the enone of Formula 2 can be contacted in a variety of ways in the method of Scheme 1. For example, a mixture formed from hydroxylamine and the base (typically in a solvent such as water) can be added to the enone of Formula 2 (typically in a solvent such as tetrahydrofuran or acetonitrile). Alternatively, the hydroxylamine and the base can be concurrently added separately to the enone of Formula 2. In another embodiment, the enone of Formula 2 (typically in a solvent such as tetrahydrofuran or acetonitrile) can be added to a mixture formed from the hydroxylamine and the base (typically in a solvent such as water). In these example embodiments other combinations of solvents can be used; for example, methanol with tert-butyl methyl ether instead of water with tetrahydrofuran or acetonitrile.<br>
The method of Scheme 1 can be conducted at a reaction temperature between about 0 and 150 °C, or most conveniently between 20 and 40 °C. The product of Formula 1 is isolated by the usual methods known to those skilled in the art including extraction and crystallization.<br>
Scheme 2<br>
(Scheme Removed)<br>
Compounds of Formula 2 can be prepared by dehydration of compounds of Formula 3 as shown in Scheme 2 according to the general method of Sosnovskikh et al.,.J. Org. Chem. USSR/(Eng. Trans.), 1992, 28, 420.<br>
This method involves portion-wise addition of a dehydrating agent such as thionyl chloride to a mixture of a compound of Formula 3 and a base in an organic solvent such as toluene to provide a compound of Formula 2. About two molar equivalents of thionyl chloride relative to the compound of Formula 3 are typically required for high levels of conversion to the compound of Formula 2.<br>
Bases useful in the method of Scheme 2 include amine bases such as pyridine. About three molar equivalents of pyridine relative to the compound of Formula 3 is typically necessary to achieve the conversion of the compound of Formula 3 to the compound of Formula 2.<br>
The method of Scheme 2 is generally conducted using a reaction temperature in the range of about 50 to about 80 °C, more commonly in the range of about 60 to about 65 °C.<br>
After the reaction mixture is treated with water to remove salts, the product can be isolated by the usual methods known to one skilled in the art such as extraction and crystallization.<br>
As shown in Scheme 3, compounds of Formula 2 can also be prepared from addition-elimination reactions of organometallic reagents such as Grignard reagents of Formula 4 with ß-enamines or ß-haloenones of Formula 5.<br>
Scheme 3<br>
(Scheme Removed)<br>
The reaction can be run in a variety of solvents including tetrahydrofuran, diethyl ether, dioxane or methylene chloride, and optimum temperatures range from about -78 °C to the refluxing temperature of the solvent. General procedures for additions of Grignard reagents to enamines and haloenones are well documented in the chemical literature; see for example, Jeong et al., Journal of Fluorine Chemistry 2004, 125, 1629-1638, as well as references cited within. The method of Scheme 3 is illustrated in Reference Example 1, Step B.<br>
Alternatively, as shown in Scheme 4, a compound of Formula 2 can be formed by condensation of a ketone of Formula 6 with a phosphonate compound of Formula 7 according to the Wadsworth-Emmons modification of the Wittig Reaction.<br>
Scheme 4<br>
(Scheme Removed)<br>
In this method, the phosphonate compound of Formula 7 is deprotonated with a base such as pyridine, triethylamine, NaH, NaHCO3 or lithium diisopropylamide (LDA) in a solvent such as tetrahydrofuran, diethyl ether, dioxane or methylene chloride to form a ylid intermediate, and the ketone of Formula 6 is added to provide the compound of Formula 2. Optimum temperatures range from about 0 °C to the refluxing temperature of the solvent. The general reaction conditions of the Wittig Reaction are well documented in the chemical literature. For example, see Dull et al.,J. Org. Chem. 1967, 32, 1622-1623.<br>
A wide variety of methods exist for the preparation of ß-hydroxyketone compounds of Formula 3. For example, ketones can be combined under acidic, or more commonly basic conditions, to provide compounds of Formula 3. The aldol condensation has been extensively reviewed (e.g., Organic Reactions, 1968, 16, 1), and wide range of conditions have been used to achieve this transformation. This reaction is illustrated in Scheme 5.<br>
Scheme 5<br>
(Scheme Removed)<br>
Some of the conditions usually employed in the aldol condensadtion may be precluded by the reactivity of compounds of Formula 6 (e.g., wherein R1 is CF3) and compounds of Formula 3 (e.g., wherein R1 is CF3) with nucleophiles. A compound of Formula 3 wherein R1 is CF3 can be prepared by addition of a non-nucleophilic base such as lithium hydride (Sosnovskikh et al., J. Org. Chem. USSR (Eng. Trans.), 1992, 28, 420), or potassium carbonate to a mixture of a ketone of Formula 6 and a ketone of Formula 8 in a suitable non-nucleophilic organic solvent such as tetrahydrofuran, hexanes, toluene, or acetonitrile. Usually, more than one molar equivalent of the base relative to the ketone of Formula 8 used.<br>
Alternatively small changes in the reaction conditions can be used to prepare compounds of Formula 2 directly from compounds of Formula 6 and compounds of Formula 8. For example suitable conditions, such as treatment with a mixture comprising potassium carbonate and acetonitrile at about 82 °C, can be used to prepare compounds of Formula 2. Compounds of Formula 2 can also be prepared directly from compounds of Formula 6 and compounds of Formula 8 by treatment with calcium hydroxide in N,N-dimethylformamide and tert-butyl methyl ether, and then heating the mixture to reflux with azeotropic removal of water. These reactions arc usually conducted at temperatures ranging from about 25 °C to the boiling point of the solvent(s).<br>
If the reaction is conducted using a base such as lithium diisopropylamidc or lithium bis(trimcthylsilyl)amidc, which may react with compounds of Formula 6 wherein R1 is CF3 (Gosselin et al., Organic Letters 2005, 7, 355), the order of addition of the components of the reaction becomes important. The most preferred order of addition is the metered addition of a ketone of Formula 8 to a base such as lithium diisopropylamide at about -78 °C in a solvent such as tetrahydrofuran. The enolate formed can then be contacted with a compound of Formula 6 at about -78 °C to afford the desired compound of Formula 3. The product can be isolated by methods well known to one skilled in the art such as extraction, crystallization, etc.<br>
Ketones of Formula 6 and Formula 8 can be prepared by numerous methods described in the general literature.<br>
In another aspect of the present invention, certain compounds of Formula 1 (e.g., compounds of Formula 1 wherein Q is Qb and Qb is 1-naphthalenyl substituted in the 4-position with -C(=O)OR5) prepared by the method of Scheme 1, are useful for preparing compounds of Formula la, which are particularly useful as insecticides.<br>
(Scheme Removed)<br>
wherein R2, R4 and R5 are as defined in the Summary of the Invention. A variety of routes arc possible for the preparation of compounds of Formula la from compounds of Formula 1. As outlined in Scheme 6, one such method involves the aminocarbonylation of a compound of Formula lb with an appropriately substituted amine compound of Formula 9 wherein R2, R4 and R5 are defined in the Summary of the Invention.<br>
Scheme 6<br>
(Scheme Removed)<br>
This reaction is typically carried out with an aryl bromide of Formula lb in the<br>
presence of a palladium catalyst under a CO atmosphere. The palladium catalyst used for<br>
the present method typically comprises palladium in a formal oxidation state of either 0 (i.e.<br>
Pd(O)) or 2 (i.e. Pd(II)). A wide variety of such palladium-containing compounds and<br>
complexes are useful as catalysts for the present method. Examples of palladium-containing<br>
compounds and complexes useful as catalysts in the method of Scheme 6 include<br>
PdCl2(PPh3)2       (bis(triphenylphosphine)paltadium(II)       dichloride),	Pd(PPh3)4<br>
(tctrakis(triphcnylphosphinc)palladium(O)), Pd(C5H7O2)2 (palladium(II) acctylacctonatc), Pd2(dba)3 (tris(dibcnzylidcncacctonc)dipalladium(0)), and [l,l'-bis(diphcnylphosphino)-fcrroccnC1dichloropalladium(II). The method of Scheme 6 is generally conducted in a liquid phase, and therefore to be most effective the palladium catalyst preferably has good<br>
solubility in the liquid phase. Useful solvents include, for example, ethers such as 1,2-dimethoxyethane, amides such as N,N-dimethylacetamide, and non-halogenated aromatic hydrocarbons such as toluene.<br>
The method of Scheme 6 can be conducted over a wide range of temperatures, ranging from about 25 to about 150 °C. Of note are temperatures from about 60 to about 110 °C, which typically provide fast reaction rates and high product yields. The general methods and procedures for aminocarbonylation with an aryl bromide and an amine are well known in the literature; see, for example, H. Horino et al., Synthesis 1989, 715; and J. J. Li, G. W. Gribble, editors, Palladium in Heterocyclic Chemistry: A Guide for the Synthetic Chemist, 2000.<br>
Another method of preparing compounds of Formula la is shown in Scheme 7. In this method a carboxylic acid of Formula lc is coupled with an appropriately substituted amine compound of Formula 9.<br>
Scheme 7<br>
(Scheme Removed)<br>
This reaction is generally carried out in the presence of a dehydrating coupling reagent such as dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, l-(3-dimcthylaminopropyl)-3-ethylcarbodiimide, 1-propanephosphonic acid cyclic anhydride or carbonyl diimidazole in the presence of a base such as triethylamine, pyridine, 4-(dimethylamino)pyridine or N,N-diisopropylethylarnine in an anhydrous aprotic solvent such as dichloromethane or tetrahydrofuran at a temperature typically between 25 and 70 °C.<br>
Compounds of Formula lc can be prepared by hydrolysis of esters of Formula 1d, wherein R5 is methyl or ethyl, as shown in Scheme 8.<br>
Scheme 8<br>
(Scheme Removed)<br>
In the method of Scheme 8, an ester of Formula 1d is converted to a corresponding carboxylic acid of Formula 1c by general procedures well known in the art. For example, treatment of a methyl or ethyl ester of Formula 1d with aqueous lithium hydroxide in tetrahydrofuran, followed by acidification yields the corresponding carboxylic acid of Formula lc.<br>
It is recognized that some reagents and reaction conditions described above for preparing compounds of Formula 1 may not be compatible with certain functionalities present in the intermediates. In these instances, the incorporation of protection/deprotection sequences or functional group interconversions into the synthesis will aid in obtaining the desired products. The use and choice of the protecting groups will be apparent to one skilled in chemical synthesis (sec, for example, Greene, T. W.; Wuts, P. G. M. Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, 2nd ed.; Wiley: New York, 1991). One skilled in the art will recognize that, in some cases, after the introduction of a given reagent as it is depicted in any individual scheme, it may be necessary to perform additional routine synthetic steps not described in detail to complete the synthesis of compounds of Formula 1. One skilled in the art will also recognize that it may be necessary to perform a combination of the steps illustrated in the above schemes in an order other than that implied by the particular sequence presented to prepare the compounds of Formula 1.<br>
One skilled in the art will also recognize that compounds of Formula 1 and the intermediates described herein can be subjected to various electrophilic, nucleophilic, radical, organometallic, oxidation, and reduction reactions to add substituents or modify existing substituents.<br>

oxo-2-buten-1 -yl]-N-[2-oxo-2-[(2,2,2-trifluoroethyl)amino]ethyl]-1-naphthalenecarboxamide<br>
A mixture of the product of Synthesis Example 7, Step B (10.00 g, 28.38 mmol), l-[3-chloro-5-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]-2,2,2-trifluoroethanone (9.00 g, 32.5 mmol), calcium hydroxide (1.05 g, 14.2 mmol), N,N-dimethylformamide (20 mL) and tot-butyl methyl ether (32 mL) was placed in a thermometer-equipped reaction vessel. The reaction vessel was connected to a ten-plate Oldershaw column, the output of which was condensed and fed into a decanter initially filled with tert-butyl methyl ether. A nitrogen atmosphere was maintained in the apparatus. The upper part of the decanter was connected to return condensate to the fifth plate of the Oldershaw column. This arrangement ensured that wet (containing dissolved water) tert-butyl methyl ether was not returned from the decanter to the reaction vessel. A drain valve at the bottom of the decanter allowed removing tert-butyl methyl ether in addition to water from the decanter. The reaction mixture was heated to distill the tot-butyl methyl ether/water azeotrope. As the decanter trap contained an amount of tot-butyl methyl ether sufficient to dissolve all of the water formed by the reaction, the condensate in the trap did not separate into layers containing predominately water and predominately tot-butyl methyl ether. Because the reaction mixture initially contained mostly tert-butyl methyl ether, the mixture boiled at a temperature not much exceeding the normal boiling point of tot-butyl methyl ether (e.g., about 65-70 °C). The reaction proceeded relatively slowly at this temperature, so condensate was gradually drained from the decanter trap to remove tot-butyl methyl ether. As the concentration of tot-butyl methyl ether decreased in the reaction mixture, the temperature of the boiling mixture increased. Tert-butyl methyl ether was removed by draining the decanter until the temperature of the boiling reaction mixture reached about 85 °C. To maintain this temperature, tot-butyl methyl ether was added as needed to compensate for loss of solvent from the apparatus. The total time from the start of heating the reaction mixture to stopping distillation, not including a shutdown period overnight, was about 6 h.<br>
To isolate the product, the mixture was cooled to room temperature and was added to a mixture of tot-butyl methyl ether (50 mL) and 1N hydrochloric acid (100 mL). The organic phase was separated, and heptane (60 mL) was added dropwise. The mixture was filtered to provide the title product as an off white solid mixture of isomers (14 g, 81% yield) melting at 174.5-177 °C.<br>

The tert-butyl methyl ether/water azeotrope was removed as described in Synthesis Example 7, Step C. As the decanter trap contained an amount of tert-butyl methyl ether sufficient to dissolve all of the water formed by the reaction, the condensate in the trap did not separate into layers containing predominately water and predominately tert-butyl methyl ether. Tert-butyl methyl ether was removed by gradually draining the decanter trap until the reaction temperature was 85 °C.
