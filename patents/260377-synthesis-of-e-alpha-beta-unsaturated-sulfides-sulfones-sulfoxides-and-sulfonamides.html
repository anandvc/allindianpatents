The term "substituted" means that an atom or group of atoms has replaced hydrogen as the substituent attached to another group. For aryl and heteroaryl groups, the term "substituted" refers to any level of substitution, namely mono-, di-, tri-, terra-, or penta-substitution, where such substitution is permitted. The substituents are independently selected, and substitution may be at any chemically accessible position.<br>
The a,p-unsaturated sulfides, sulfones, sulfoxides and sulfonamides are characterized by isomerism resulting from the presence of a double bond. This isomerism is commonly referred to as cis-trans isomerism, but the more comprehensive naming convention employs E and Z designations. The compounds are named according to the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog system, the IUPAC 1974 Recommendations, Section E: Stereochemistry, in Nomenclature of Organic Chemistry, John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., New York, NY, 4th ed., 1992, p. 127-138. Using this system of nomenclature, the four groups about a double bond are prioritized according to a series of rules. Then, that isomer with the two higher ranking groups on the same side of the double bond is designated Z (for the German word "zusarnmen", meaning together). The other isomer, in which the two<br>
higher-ranking groups are on opposite sides of the double bond, is designated E (for the German word "entgegen", which means "opposite"). Thus if the four groups on a carbon-carbon double bond are ranked with A being the lowest rank and D being highest, A &gt; B &gt; C &gt; D, the isomers would be named as in Scheme 1.<br>
(Scheme Removed)<br>
α,ß-Unsaturated (aryl or heteroaryl) sulfides, sulfones, sulfoxides and sulfonamides in the ß-configuration are formed selectively the process of the present invention.<br>
Some of the sulfides, sulfones, sulfoxides and sulfonamides according to Formulae I and III may be characterized by isomerism resulting from the presence of a chiral center at X, when X is CH and R is other than -H. Compounds according to Formula III have a chiral center at the carbon designated by ‡. The isomers resulting from the presence of a chiral center comprise a pair of non-superimposable isomers that are called "enantiomers." Single enantiomers of a pure compound are optically active, i.e., they are capable of rotating the plane of plane polarized light. Single enantiomers are designated according to the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog system. See March, Advanced Organic Chemistry, 4th Ed., (1992), p. 109. Once the priority ranking of the four groups is determined, the molecule is oriented so that the lowest ranking group is pointed away from the viewer. Then, if the descending rank order of the other groups proceeds clockwise, the molecule is designated (R) and if the descending rank of the other groups proceeds counterclockwise, the molecule is designated (S). In the example shown in Scheme 2 below, the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog ranking is A &gt; B &gt; C &gt; D. The lowest ranking atom, D is oriented away from the viewer.<br>
Unless otherwise indicated, both absolute configurations and mixtures thereof are included in the scope of a,p-unsaturated (aryl or heteroaryl) sulfides, sulfones, sulfoxides and sulfonamides of Formula I that may be prepared according to the process of the invention and novel compounds of Formula III.<br>
The expression "substantially free" of the (R)- or (S)-enantiomer, when used to refer to an optically active compound according to Formula III, means the (R)- and (S)-enantiomers of the compound have been separated such that the composition is 80% or more by weight a single enantiomer. Preferably, the composition is 90% or more by weight a single enantiomer. More preferably, the composition is 95% or more by weight a single enantiomer. Most preferably, the composition is 99% or more by weight a single enantiomer.<br>
Thus, by an "(R)-enantiomer of a compound according to Formula III substantially free of the (.S)-enantiomer" is meant the compound comprises 80% or more by weight of its (R)-enantiomer and likewise contains 20% or less of its (S)-enantiomer as a contaminant, by weight.<br>
Isolated optical isomers may be purified from racemic mixtures by well-known chiral separation techniques. According to one such method, a racemic mixture of a compound having the structure of Formula I, or a chiral intermediate thereof, is separated into 99% wt.% pure optical isomers by HPLC using .a suitable chiral column, such as a member of the series of DAICEL® CHIRALPAK® family of columns (Daicel Chemical Industries, Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). The column is operated according to the manufacturer's instructions.<br>
In addition, chiral compounds such as the secondary alcohols according to Formula III may be prepared by chiral reduction of intermediate ketone compounds according to Formula II. Catalytic asymmetric synthesis using chiral metal complexes as catalyst precursors has been employed successfully to reduce prochiral ketones to optically active secondary alcohols. See, Noyori R., Asymmetric Catalysis in Organic<br>
Synthesis, New York, John Wiley, 1994, pages 1-82, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
For compounds according to Formula III, more than one chiral center may be present in a molecule, i.e., the carbon atom of X when X is CH and R is other than -H, and the carbon atom designated by ‡. Two pairs of enantiomers result from the presence of two chiral centers. Only the relationship between the mirror-image isomers is termed enantiomeric. The relationship between a single enantiomer and other isomers that exist as a result of additional chiral centers is termed "diastereomeric." Diastereomeric pairs may be resolved by known separation techniques including normal and reverse phase chromatography, and crystallization. Compounds of the present invention according to Formula III, wherein X is CH and R is other than -H, encompass isolated diastereomers, e.g., (R,R), (R,S), (S,R), and (S,S); isolated diastereomeric pairs, e.g., (R,R) and (R,S), or (S,R), and (S,S); and all mixtures of diastereomers in any proportion.<br>

Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
Preparation of the compounds of Formula I by the process of the present invention comprises reduction of a ß-ketosulfide, ß-ketosulfoxide, ß-ketosulfone, or ß-ketosulfonamide compound of Formula II to form a secondary alcohol of Formula III. This step is followed by dehydration of the alcohol of Formula III to form a compound according to Formula I.<br>
A. Reduction of Compounds According to Formula II<br>
Reducing a compound of Formula n to yield a secondary alcohol of Formula in may be performed by reacting the Formula II compound with a suitable reducing agent under reaction conditions capable of selectively reducing a ketone to the corresponding alcohol. The reducing agent and reaction conditions may further be selected to reduce other moieties present in the Formula II compound if the reduction of such additional moieties serves to allow the preparation of a specific desired compound of Formula I.<br>
Suitable reducing agents include hydride reagents such as sodium borohydride, lithium aluminum hydride and sodium bis(2-methoxyethoxy)aluminum hydride. The reaction is preferably performed in the presence of a solvent. Suitable solvents include organic solvents such as, for example diethyl ether, t-butylmethyl ether, tetrahydroftmm (THF) and toluene. The reaction is preferably performed at a temperature in the range from about 0 °C to about 100 °C, more preferably from about 0 °C to about 50 °C, most preferably from about 0 °C to about 30 °C.<br>
The desired compound according to Formula II may be isolated from the reaction mixture by, for example, adding a suitable proton source, e.g., water, acetic acid, aqueous HC1, or aqueous NH4+C1 to the reaction mixture to quench any remaining hydride reagent, hydrolyzing intermediate metal species, removing the volatile components of the reaction mixture under vacuum and purifying the residue, e.g., by chromatographic separation.<br>
Suitable conditions for reducing a compound of Formula II to yield a secondary alcohol of Formula III also include catalytic hydrogenation conditions. Suitable catalysts, for catalytic hydrogenation include platinum palladium, ruthenium and nickel reagents. The reaction is preferably performed in the presence of a suitable solvent. Suitable solvents include alkyl alcohols such as methanol and ethanol, THF, and dioxane. The reaction is preferably performed at a hydrogen pressure in the range from about 1 to about 5 atmospheres, more preferably from 1 to 3 atmospheres. The reaction is preferably performed at a temperature in the range from about 0 °C to about 50 °C, most preferably in the range form about 20 °C to about 30 °C. The desired compound according to Formula II may be isolated from the reaction mixture by, for example, removing the catalyst, preferably by filtration, concentrating the filtered reaction mkture to form a residue, and purifying the residue, e.g., by chromatographic separation.<br>
Exemplary reaction conditions for performing catalytic hydrogenation are described by R. L. Augustine, Catalytic Hydrogenation, Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York (1965), and Paul N. Rylander, Catalytic Hydrogenation in Organic Synthesis, Academic Press, New York (1979) and the references cited therein, the entire disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
The reduction of a compound of Formula II to yield an optically active secondary alcohol of Formula III may be performed by using any reducing agent and reaction conditions capable of asymmetrically reducing a ketone to the corresponding optically active alcohol. Suitable reactions include, for example, catalytic hydrogenation with a chiral Rh(I), Ir(I), Ru(II), or lanthanoid complex as a catalyst precursor; hydrogen; and a chiral auxiliary and enantioselective hydroboration with reagents such as, for example, (+)-5-chlorodiisopinocampheylborane or (-)-B-chlorodiisopinocampheylborane.<br>
Suitable chiral auxiliaries for chiral catalytic reductions include, for example, BINAP (2,2'-bis-(diphenylphosphino)-l,1-binaphthyl) or an analog thereof, and PNP (6-diphenylphosphinomethyl)-pyridine Preferred hydrogenation catalysts include, for example, Ru-(R)BINAP(Br)2) Ru-(R)BINAP(Cl)2, Ru-(S)BINAP(Br)25 Ru-(5)BINAP(C1)2, Ru-(R)BINAP(OAc)2, and Ru-(S)BINAP(OAc)2. A suitable hydrogen pressure for the asymmetric reduction is preferably in the range from about 1 to about 100 atmospheres, more preferably from about 1 to about 70 atmospheres. The reaction is preferably performed at a temperature in the range from about 0°C to about 50 °C, more preferably from about 20 °C to about 30 °C.<br>
B. Dehydration of Compounds According to Formula III<br>
Dehydrating a compound of Formula III to yield an α,ß-unsaturated sulfone, sulfoxide or sulfonamide of Formula I may be performed by reaction with a suitable dehydrating agent under conditions capable of accomplishing such a dehydration.<br>
The dehydration of the Formula III compound may be performed by reacting the Formula III compound with a Lewis acid or a mixture of different Lewis acids. Preferred Lewis acids include BF3 etherate, BCl3 and aluminum chloride. The reaction is preferably performed in the presence of a suitable solvent, most preferably a solvent that forms a low boiling azeotrope with water. Suitable solvents include, for example, non-protic solvents such as methyl acetate, ethyl acetate diethyl ether, THF, toluene, methylene chloride, chloroform or carbon tetrachloride.<br>
The reaction may be carried out at a temperature in the range, for example, from about -20 °C to about 100 °C, preferably in the range from about -20 °C to about 25 °C, most preferably in the range from about 0 °C to about 10 °C.<br>
The desired product of Formula I may be isolated from the dehydration reaction mixture, for example, by removing the volatile components of the reaction mixture under vacuum and purifying the residue by chromatographic separation.<br>
Dehydration of the alcohol of Formula m may also be accomplished by first derivatizing the -OH group, for example by acylation or halogenation, either prior to, or during, the dehydration reaction. The derivatized alcohol of Formula III then reacts to form the Formula I olefin by a ß-elimination, e.g., dehydrohalogenation. Derivatization of the -OH group serves to replace -OH with a leaving group that is more reactive than -OH (e.g., tosyl, mesyl, trifyl, nosyl, chloro, bromo, or iodo) and thereby facilitate P-elimination of the derivatized -OH to yield the double bond. Suitable derivatizations of the -OH group of a compound of Formula III include, for example, acylation, e.g., acetylation; sulfonylation, e.g., tosylation; and halogenation, e.g. chlorination.<br>
Acylation of the -OH group of a Formula HI compound may be accomplished by reaction of the Formula III  compound with an acylating agent such as an anhydride, e.g., acetic anhydride or an acid halide, e.g., acetyl chloride. The acylation reaction is preferably performed in the presence of a suitable solvent Suitable solvents include aprotic solvents such as, for example, THF or ether.<br>
Sulfonylation of the -OH group of a Formula III compound may be accomplished by reaction of the Formula III compound with an sulfonylating agent such as, for example, an anhydride, e.g., triflic anhydride or a sulfonic acid halide, e.g., tosyl chloride. The sulfonylation reaction is preferably performed in the presence of a suitable solvent. Suitable solvents include aprotic solvents such as, for example, THF or ether.<br>
Halogenation of the -OH group of a Formula III compound may be accomplished by reaction of the Formula III compound with an halogenating agent such as, for example, thionyl chloride or phosphorous oxychloride. The halogenation reaction is preferably performed in the presence of a suitable solvent. Suitable solvents include aprotic solvents such as, for example, THF or ether. The halogenation reaction serves to replace the -OH group with a halogen.<br>
Dehydration of a compound according to Formula II, or a compound of Formula II derivatized, by acylation, sulfonylation or halogenation, for example, may be accomplished by reaction with a base such as triethylamine (TEA), N,N-<br>
diisopropylethylamine (DIEA) or diazabicycloundecene (DBU). The reaction is preferably performed in the presence of a suitable solvent such as for example, methyl acetate, ethyl acetate diethyl ether, THF, toluene, methylene chloride, chloroform or carbon tetrachloride, Preferably, the reaction is performed at an elevated temperature from about 30 °C to about 100 °C, more preferably at the reflux temperature of the solvent in which the reaction is conducted.<br>
C. Preparation of Compounds According to Formula II.<br>
One preferred method for the preparation of compounds according to Formula II is by electrophilic acylation of an aromatic compound comprising Ar2, according to Scheme 3.<br>
(Scheme Removed)<br>
The reaction of a compound of Formula IIc and a compound of Formula IId is preferably performed, according to Scheme 3, by adding a Lewis acid to a solution of the reactant compounds, and heating the resulting reaction mixture to a suitable reaction temperature. The reaction is preferably performed at a temperature in the range from about 50 °C to about 200 °C, preferably from about 80 °C to about 150 °C.

If the Formula nd reactant is not suitable as a solvent, a suitable solvent is preferably a high boiling solvent which is unreactive under the reaction conditions, e.g., nitrobenzene. Suitable Lewis acids include, for example, A1C13, BF3, BC13, ZnCl2, ZnBr2, and P2O5..<br>
A preferred preparation of the sulfide compounds according to Formula II proceeds, as shown in Scheme 4, by reacting an aromatic mercaptan according to Formula IIIa and a Formula IIa compound, wherein Ar1, Ar2, R, and * are defined as for Formula I, above, and X is CH. Sulfoxide compounds of Formula II or sulfone compounds of Formula II may be prepared according to Scheme 7, by oxidizing a Formula II sulfide compound (X = CH, n = 0) to the corresponding sulfoxide or sulfone according Formula II.<br>
(Scheme Removed)<br>
The reaction of a compound of Formula IIa and a compound of Formula IIb (X = CH), according to Scheme 4 is preferably performed by contacting the compound of Formula IIa with a base addition salt of the compound of Formula IIb (X = CH), preferably in the presence of a suitable solvent.<br>
Preferred base addition salts of a compound of Formula IIb are alkali metal salts or alkaline earth metal salts.

Preferably, the Formula IIa compound is added to the Formula IIb compound in portions or continuously over a suitable time interval. Preferably, the time interval is from about 2 to about 60 minutes, more preferably from about 5 to about 30 minutes. The addition of the Formula Ila compound is preferably performed at a temperature in the range from about 0 °C to about 50 °C, more preferably from about 0 °C to about 30 °C, most preferably at about 25 °C. When the addition is complete, the resulting reaction mixture is preferably heated to a suitable reaction temperature. A suitable temperature is preferably in the range from about 50 °C to about 100 °C, most preferably at about the boiling point of the reaction mixture.<br>
The reaction mixture is maintained at the reaction temperature until the reaction is complete. Determination of the completion of the reaction may be determined by any reasonable means. Preferably, the reaction is monitored by thin layer chromatography (TLC) or by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).<br>
When the reaction is complete, the Formula n sulfide compound is preferably isolated by cooling the reaction mixture and pouring the reaction mixture onto ice or ice water to precipitate the product. The product Formula II sulfide compound may then be separated, e.g., by filtration and dried under vacuum.<br>
Formula II sulfoxide compounds and Formula II sulfone compounds may be prepared by oxidizing the Formula n sulfide compound. Oxidation to the sulfone compound of Formula n may be accomplished by reaction with any oxidizing agent and reaction conditions capable of oxidizing a sulfide to a sulfone. Suitable oxidizing reagents for both oxidation reactions include, for example, peroxides such as, hydrogen peroxide, peracids such as meta-chloroperoxybenzoic acid (MCPBA) and persulfates such as OXONE® (potassium peroxymonosulfate). The reaction is preferably carried out in the presence of a suitable solvent. Suitable solvents include, for example, water, acetic acid or non-polar solvents such as dichloromethane (DCM).<br>
Reaction to selectively form a Formula n sulfoxide compound is preferably performed at low temperature, more preferably from about -10 °C to about 20 °C. A reaction to form the Formula n sulfoxide compound is preferably monitored so as to terminate the reaction prior to appreciable oxidation to the corresponding sulfone. When the reaction is complete, the reaction mixture may be poured onto crushed ice. A solid precipitate of the crude product may be collected by filtration and recrystallized from a suitable solvent such as, for example, hot water to yield the purified Formula n sulfoxide compound.<br>
Reaction to form the Formula II sulfone compound may be performed at higher temperature, for example, from about 20 °C to about 100 °C with an oxidizing agent such as, for example, 30% hydrogen peroxide in glacial acetic acid. When the reaction is complete, the reaction mixture may be cooled to ambient temperature and poured onto crushed ice. A solid precipitate of the crude product may be collected by filtration and recrystallized from a suitable solvent such as, for example, hot water to yield the purified Formula II sulfone compound.<br>
D. Use of Protecting Groups in the Preparation of Compounds of the Invention<br>
In the reactions described herein for preparing compounds of Formula I, any reactive groups present may be protected during a reaction by protecting groups. A "protecting group" is a chemical functionality which selectively blocks one or more reactive sites in a multifunctional compound such that a chemical reaction can be carried out selectively at another unprotected reactive site. Certain processes for preparation of compounds according to the present invention may rely upon protecting groups to block reactive functional groups that are present in the reactants. Examples of reactive groups which may be blocked by suitable protecting groups include -NH2 or -OH groups which may be present, for example, on chemical intermediates according to Formula IIb. If such groups were not blocked by suitable protecting groups prior to reaction with an intermediate according to Formula IIa, unwanted side reactions could occur. One example of such a side reaction is that a -NHz or -OH group on the Formula IIb compound may react with the Formula IIa intermediate in addition to, and in competition with the -SH group on the Formula IIb compound.<br>
Thus, the protecting group may be introduced prior to carrying out a particular reaction that may affect a chemical group other than one that is desired. The protecting group is optionally removed at any suitable point in the synthesis after the reaction which required use of the protecting group.<br>
For example, in the process of preparing a compound according to Formula I, the desired product of Formula I may have an acetyl group on Ar1. If the intermediate of Formula II is substituted by an acetyl group and is reduced to form an intermediate of Formula HI, the acetyl group on Ar1 will be reduced in the reaction. Thus, the intermediate of Formula II would be prepared with the acetyl group protected, for example as a ketal. The ketal will be unreactive under the conditions required to reduce the intermediate of Formula I to an intermediate of Formula III.<br>
Protecting groups may be chosen from any protecting groups described in the literature or known to the skilled chemist as suitable for the protection of the functional group which must be protected. Protecting groups may be introduced and removed by any suitable chemical synthesis method that is described in the art or known to the skilled chemist as suitable for the removal of the particular protecting group. Methods of removing protecting groups are preferably selected so as to effect selective removal of the protecting group with minimum effect on other chemical functionality in the molecule.<br>
Protecting groups for alcoholic or phenolic hydroxyl groups, include, for example, acetates, haloalkyl carbonates, benzyl ethers, alkylsilyl ethers, heterocyclyl ethers, and methyl or alkyl ethers. Protecting groups for carboxyl groups include t-butyl, benzyl or methyl esters. Protecting groups for amine groups include benzyl, 2,4-dimethoxybenzyl, CBZ, p-methoxybenzyloxycarbonyl, p-nitrobenzyloxycarbonyl, t-BOC, trifluoroacetyl. Methods for removal of hydroxy and amino protecting groups include, for example, acid, base, metal or enzyme-catalyzed hydrolysis for CBZ; acid or iodotrimethylsilane for removal of t-BOC groups; hydrogenation for benzyl and CBZ; and photolysis for o-nitrobenzyloxycarbonyl.<br>
Protecting groups may also include different oxidation states of a chemical group. An example of such a protecting group is a nitro group, which may readily be reduced to an amino group. The amino group may be reactive under the reaction conditions of a<br>
synthetic step whereas the corresponding nitro group may be inert to the reaction conditions. In such cases, the synthetic step may be performed with a nitro group in the place of the amino group. The nitro group may be reduced to the desired amino group at a later point in the synthesis.<br>
Further examples of protecting groups can be found in Green and Wuts, Protecting Groups in Organic Synthesis, 3rd edition, published by John Wiley and Sons, New York (1999) and Harrison et al, "Compendium of Synthetic Organic Methods," Vols. 1-8 by John Wiley and Sons (1971-1996), the entire disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
One example of the application of protecting groups is shown in Scheme 5, for the preparation of the compound (E)-5-((2,4,6-trimethoxystyrylsulfonyl)methyl)-2-methoxybenzenamine 14:<br><br>
(Scheme Removed)<br>
According to Scheme 5, (4-methoxy-3-nitrophenyl)methanethiol 10 (an aromatic mercaptan according to Formula 11b) is reacted with 2-bromo-l-(2,4,6-trimethoxyphenyl)ethanone (a compound according to Formula Ha) to form 2-(4-methoxy-3-nitrobenzylthio)-l-(2,4,6-trimethoxyphenyl)ethanone 11. (a sulfide according<br>
to Formula II). Suitable reaction conditions for this reaction are as described above for the reaction of a Formula IIa compound and a Formula IIb compound.<br>
Compound 11. is reacted with an oxidizing agent capable of oxidizing a sulfide to a sulfone, thereby forming 2-(4-memoxy-3-nitrobenzylsulfonyl)-l-(2,4,6-trimethoxyphenyl)ethanone 12 (a sulfone compound according to Formula II). Suitable oxidation conditions are as described above for the oxidation of a Formula n sulfide compound to a Formula n sulfone compound.<br>
Compound 12! is reacted under conditions sufficient to reduce the ketone moiety to a secondary alcohol thereby forming 2-(3-amino-4-methoxybenzylsulfonyl)-l-(2,4,6-trimethoxyphenyl)ethanol, 13 (a compound according to Formula III). The reduction is performed under any conditions sufficient to reduce the ketone moiety of compound 12 to a secondary alcohol, and sufficient to reduce the nitro moiety of compound 12 to an amine. The reduction may be performed, for example, by hydrogenation in the presence of a hydrogenation catalyst. The hydrogenation is preferably carried out in the presence of a solvent. Suitable solvents include, for example, ethanol, methanol, THF, and acetic acid. Suitable hydrogenation catalysts include platinum, palladium, nickel and ruthenium catalysts. The hydrogenation reaction is preferably performed at a temperature in the range from about 0°C to about 100 °C, more preferably from about 10 °C to about 60 °C, most preferably from about 20 °C to about 30 °C. The hydrogenation reaction is preferably performed at a hydrogen pressure in the range from about 1 to about 100 atmospheres, more preferably from about 1 to about 10 atmospheres, most preferably from about 1 to about 3 atmospheres.<br>
Alternatively, reduction of the ketone moiety and the nitro moiety of compound 12 may be performed as separate reaction steps. For example, the ketone moiety may be reduced by reaction with a hydride reagent such as sodium borohydride, lithium aluminum hydride and sodium bis(2-methoxyethoxy)aluminum hydride as described herein. Following the reduction of the ketone moiety, the nitro moiety may be reduced, for example by catalytic hydrogenation as described above, or by other procedure such as, for example reaction with zinc and acetic acid, or tin and aqueous HC1, or by other methods of aromatic nitro group reduction known in the art.<br>
Compound 13 is reacted under conditions sufficient to dehydrate the secondary alcohol moiety of compound 13 to form (E)-5-((2,4,6-trimethoxystyrylsulfonyl)methyl)-2-methoxybenzenamine, 14 (a compound according to Formula I). Suitable conditions under which compound 13 may be dehydrated to form compound 14 are as described above for the dehydration of a Formula III compound to form a Formula I compound.<br>
The practice of the invention is illustrated by the following non-limiting examples.<br>

To a solution of phenacyl arylmethanesulfide 3 (5g) in glacial acetic acid (40 mL), is added 30% hydrogen peroxide (10 mL). The resulting solution is stirred at ambient temperature (25 °C) for 8 hours. The reaction is monitored by TLC to determine when the reaction is complete. When the reaction is complete, the solution is then poured onto crushed ice (about 200 g). A solid precipitates and is separated by filtration. The separated solid is recrystallized from 2-propanol to yield the purified product phenacyl arylmethanesulfone 4. The intermediate phenacyl arylmethanesulfone 4 is a compound according to Formula n.<br>
Step C. Preparation of l-Arvl-2-arvlmethanesulfonvl-ethanol 5:<br>
To a solution of phenacyl arylmethanesulfone 4 (10 mmol) in tetrahydrofuran (30 mL) is added sodium borohydride (20 mmol). The resulting mixture is stirred for 8 h at ambient temperature (25 °C). The reaction is monitored by TLC to determine when the reaction is complete. After completion of the reaction, the solvent is removed under vacuum to form a residue. Water (200 mL) is added to the residue. A solid precipitate forms. The precipitate is separated by filtration, washed with water (3 x 25 mL) and purified by • column chromatography to yield the purified product l-aryl-2-arylmethanesulfonyl-ethanol 5. Intermediate l-aryl-2-arylmethanesulfonyl-ethanol5is a compound of the invention according to Formula III.<br>
Step Dl. Preparation of (E)styrl benzylsulfone 6 (Method 1):<br>
Boron trifluoride etherate (5 mmol) is added to an acetic anhydride (10 mL) solution of the l-aryl-2-aryhnethanesulfonyl-ethanol 5 (5 mmol) at 0 °C. The resulting mixture is stirred for 0.5 h. The mixture is then poured into chloroform (25 mL). The organic layer is separated. The organic layer is washed with saturated aqueous NaHCO3 (2 x 25 mL), and water (2 x 25 mL). The organic layer is then dried over sodium sulfate,<br>
filtered and concentrated under vacuum to yield a residue. The residue is recrystallized from 2-propanol to yield the desired (£)-styryl benzylsulfone product 6.<br>
Step D2. Preparation of (E)-styryl benzylsulfone 6 (Method 2).<br>
To a cooled solution of the phenacyl arylmethanesulfone 4 (5 mmol) in ethanol (50 mL), is added sodium borohydride (5 mmol). The resulting mixture is stirred for 1 h at ambient temperature (25 °C). A few crystals of bromocresol blue are added as a pH indicator and the resulting mixture is heated to reflux temperature and maintained at reflux temperature for 1 h. Concentrated HC1 is added dropwise to the heated solution until the color of the solution changes to yellow. After refluxing for 5 h, the solution is diluted with water (50 mL). The diluted mixture is cooled to 0 °C and stirred for 0.5 h. A solid precipitate forms. The precipitate is separated by filtration, washed with water (2 x 25 mL), and dried to yield the desired (E)-styryl benzylsulfone product 6. (E)-styryl benzylsulfone product 6 is a compound according to Formula I prepared according to the process of the invention.<br>

Step A2. Preparation of Phenacvl Arylmethanesulfone 4<br>
Benzyl sulfonyl acetic acid 7 (4.1 mmol) is added to a phenyl compound 8 (30 mL).   To this mixture is added phosphorous pentoxide (4.0 g).   The resulting reaction<br>
mixture is heated to 81° C and maintained at that temperature until the reaction is complete. The reaction is monitored by TLC. When the reaction is complete by TLC analysis, the reaction mixture is cooled to ambient temperature (25 °C). Dichloromethane (25 mL) is added to the cooled reaction mixture. A viscous solid precipitate forms. The precipitate is separated by filtration. The precipitate is washed with dichlorometbane (2 x 50 mL). The filtrate and the dichloromethane washes are combined and concentrated under vacuum to yield a residue. The residue is purified by column chromatography to yield the purified phenacyl arylmethanesulfone compound 4 according to Formula n.<br>
