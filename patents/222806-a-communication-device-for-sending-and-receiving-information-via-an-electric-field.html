Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a communication system and is preferably applicable to a communication system for sending and receiving information via an electric field, for example.<br>
Background Art<br>
Conventionally, communication systems have been adapted to send and receive information using a radiation field (radio waves), for example, between mobile telephones, and send and receive information via electromagnetic induction, for example, between the coil in a data reader/writer provided on a ticket checking and collecting machine at a station and the coil in an IC card.<br>
Recently, there have been proposed communication systems which are provided with a human-body-side communication device fitted in contact with the skin of a human body and an equipment-side communication device in the neighborhood of the user as shown in Table 1 below. In these communication systems, an alternating voltage is applied to the human body via the electrode of the human-body-side communication device, and as a result, there is caused an electrostatic induction phenomenon at the electrode of the equipment-side communication device by the action of a capacitor using a human body intervening between the electrodes of the communication device on the human body side and the communication device on the equipment side as a medium. Using<br><br>
electrostatic induction phenomenon, information is sent and<br>
received (see Non-patent document 1, for example).<br>
At least two leads (a signal line and a reference I<br>

In these communication systems with such a configuration, since<br>
the action of a capacitor using a human body intervening between sending<br>
and receiving electrodes as a medium is the premise of physical action,<br>
the communication strength in communication between the electrodes<br>
depends on the area of the electrodes.<br>
Furthermore, since the action of a capacitor using a human body<br>
intervening between sending and receiving electrodes as a medium is<br>
the premise of physical action, it is physically impossible, when the<br>
sending electrode is fitted to the human's right wrist, for example,<br>
to communicate in directions other than the direction from the human' s<br>
right wrist to the fingertip. When the sending electrode is fitted<br>
near the human's chest, communication in directions other than the<br>
forward direction from the human's chest is physically impossible.<br>
As described above, in communication systems, since the action<br>
of a capacitor using a human body intervening between sending and<br>
receiving electrodes as a medium is the premise of physical action,<br>
there have been a problem that the communication direction is<br>
restricted by the position of the electrode fitted to a human body<br>
as well as a problem that the degree of freedom in communication is<br>
low because the communication strength depends on the electrode area.<br>
Disclosure of the Invention<br>
The present invention has been made in consideration of the above<br>
problems and proposes a communication system, a communication device<br>
and a communication method capable of enhancing the degree of freedom<br>
in communication.<br>
In the present invention, in order to solve the above problems,<br>
a communication system is configured with a first communication device<br>
for electrifying an [identification] electrification target having<br>
electrification properties by generating a quasi-electrostatic field<br>
modulated according to information to be sent; and a second<br>
communication device for detecting change in the electrification<br>
condition of the [identification] electrification target and<br>
demodulating the information based on the change.<br>
In this case, in the communication system, it is possible to cause<br>
an [identification] electrification target to act as an antenna in<br>
a quasi-electrostatic field, isotropically from the surface of the<br>
[identification] electrification target, by electrifying the<br>
[-identification] electrification target according to particular<br>
Information. Therefore, it is possible to perform communication<br>
without the communication direction being restricted by the position<br>
of the electrode of the first communication device and without the<br>
communication strength depending on the electrode area, and thereby<br>
the degree of freedom in communication can be enhanced.<br>
In the present invention, even when the [identification]<br>
electrification target is a human body, it is possible to cause the<br>
human body to act as an antenna in a quasi-electrostatic field,<br>
isotropically from the surface of the human body, irrespective of<br>
the presence or absence of movement of the human body because the<br>
human body is well electrified due to the nature thereof.<br>
Furthermore, in the present invention, by forming an electrode<br>
with a structure according to the reference frequency such that the<br>
strength of the induction field component of the electric field is<br>
below the noise floor specified according to communication bands,<br>
energy required for communication can be reduced by reduction of the<br>
induction field component and the radiation field component<br>
unnecessary for quasi-electrostatic field communication, and<br>
unnecessary propagation can be prevented to enhance spatial<br>
resolution, which enables stabilization of communication. Thus,<br>
communication can be stabilized.<br>
As described above, according to the present invention,<br>
an [identification] electrification target having electrification<br>
properties is electrified by generating a quasi-electrostatic field<br>
modulated according to information to be sent, and information is<br>
demodulated based on change in the electrification condition of the<br>
[-identification] electrification target, so that it is possible to<br>
cause the [identification] electrification target to act as an antenna<br>
Tn a quasi-electrostatic field, isotropically from the surface of<br>
the [identification] electrification target, by electrification of<br>
the [ identification ] electrification target according to particular<br>
information. Therefore, it is possible to perform communication<br>
without the communication direction being restricted by the position<br>
of the sending-side electrode and without the communication strength<br>
depending on the electrode area, and thereby the degree of freedom<br>
in communication can be enhanced.<br>
Furthermore, according to the present invention, even when the<br>
[identification] electrification target is a human body, it is<br>
possible to cause the human body to act as an antenna in a<br>
quasi-electrostatic field, isotropically from the surface of the<br>
human body, irrespective of the presence or absence of movement of<br>
the human body because the human body is well electrified due to the<br>
nature thereof. Thus, the degree of freedom in communication can be<br>
enhanced.<br>
Furthermore, according to the present invention, by forming the<br>
electrode with a structure according to the reference frequency such<br>
that the strength of the induction field component of the electric<br>
field is below the noise floor specified according to communication<br>
bands, energy required for communication can be reduced by reduction<br>
of the induction field component and the radiation field component<br>
unnecessary for quasi-electrostatic field communication, and<br>
unnecessary propagation can be prevented to enhance spatial<br>
resolution, which enables stabilization of communication. Thus,<br>
communication can be stabilized and the degree of freedom in<br>
communication can be enhanced.<br>

Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
The present invention is now described in detail with reference<br>
to the drawings.<br>
(1) Summary of the invention<br>
According to the invention, information is sent and received using<br>
an electric field. The summary of the present invention is now<br>
described in terms of the relation with the electric field.<br>
(1-1) Electric field<br>
Generally, when current flows through an electric dipole (dipole<br>
antenna), the electric field E generated according to the distance<br>
r from the antenna can be represented in a simplified formula as shown<br>
below:<br>
where [A and arc constant A is a constant, j is the imaginary<br>
unit* and k is the number of waves.<br>
As shown in the above formula (1), the electric field E can be<br>
roughly separated into a component which is in inverse proportion<br>
to the distance r raised to the third power (hereinafter, this<br>
component is referred to as a quasi-electrostatic field), a component<br>
which is in inverse proportion to the distance r raised to the second<br>
power (hereinafter, this component is referred to as an induction<br>
field) and a component which is linearly in inverse proportion to<br>
the distance r (hereinafter, this component is referred to as a<br>
radiation field).<br>
The radiation field is a component excellent in propagation<br>
capability, which does not rapidly attenuate even when the distance<br>
r is long, since it is only linearly in inverse proportion to the<br>
distance r, and therefore, it has been used as a common information<br>
transmission medium in the art of information communication.<br>
Though the induction field is a component with little<br>
transmission capability, which attenuates in inverse proportion to<br>
the distance r raised to the second power as the distance r lengthens,<br>
it has recently been used as an information transmission medium in<br>
a part of the art of information of communication.<br>
The quasi-electrostatic field is a component which rapidly<br>
attenuates in inverse proportion to the distance r raised to the third<br>
power and therefore does not a transmission capability and which<br>
Appears in close proximity to an oscillation source only as<br>
oscillation. Therefore/ it has not been utilized in the art of<br>
communication where the radiation field and the induction field are<br>
premises.<br>
The present invention is adapted to send and receive information<br>
within a neighbor communication range, with a neighbor communication<br>
(hereinafter referred to as near field communication) approach using<br>
a quasi-electrostatic field among electric fields.<br>
(1-2) Quasi-electrostatic field<br>
The quasi-electrostatic field is now described in more detail.<br>
First, the electric field E shown in the above formula. (1) is represented<br>
as an electric field at a position P (r, 9, <j>) at a predetermined distance<br>
from the origin as described in Figure 1.<br>
In this case, if it is assumed that a charge q and a charge -q<br>
exist separated by a distance 8 and the charge q changes to "Qcoscot"<br>
at a time t, then the electric fields Er, E9 and E(j) at the position<br>
can be represented as the following formulas, respectively,<br>
with the position of the charge q as the origin:<br>
In the formulas (2), the electric field Efyis "zero", and this<br>
means that there is not generated any electric field in the § direction<br>
from the position P (Figure 1).<br>
If the component which is linearly in inverse proportion to the<br>
distance r (that is, the radiation field) is separated from the electric<br>
fields Er and E6 represented in the formulas (2), then the radiation<br>
field Elr and E16 at the position P (r, 0, 
following formulas:<br>
If the component which is in inverse proportion to the distance r raised<br>
to the second power (that is, the induction field) is separated from<br>
the electric fields Er and E0 represented in the formulas (2), then<br>
the induction fields E2r and E20 at the position P (r, 0, are<br>
represented as the following formulas:<br>
Furthermore, if the component which is in inverse proportion to the<br>
distance r raised to the third power (that is, the quasi-electrostatic<br>
field) is separated from the electric fields Er and E9 represented<br>
in the formulas (2), then the quasi-electrostatic fields E3r and E30<br>
at the position P (r, 0, $) are represented as the following formulas:<br>
In the formulas (3), only the radiation field Elr is "zero", and<br>
this means that there is not generated any radiation field in the tangent<br>
direction from the position P (Figure 1).<br>
Now, in order to show the component's electric field strength<br>
of each of the radiation field, the induction field and the<br>
quasi-electrostatic field at a distance r, the radiation field E19,<br>
the induction field E26 and the quasi-electrostatic field E30 in the<br>
formulas (3) to (5) are now described in more detail.<br>
The number of waves k [nf1 ] is in the relation shown as the following<br>
formula, where the angular frequency is denoted by 00 and the light<br>
velocity is denoted by c:<br>
CO<br>
(6)<br>
If the number of waves k is substituted into the formula (6), the<br>
"j-exp(-jkr)" is removed since it-is beyond the discussion here, and<br>
the "coscot" is assumed to be one (1) since the maximum change with<br>
time between the charge q and the charge -q is to be considered, then<br>
the following formulas are obtained:<br>
If the formulas (7) are rearranged by substituting the distance 5,<br>
the charge q (= Q) and theG with one (1) , 0 . 001 [C] andTC/2, respectively,<br>
then the following formulas are obtained:<br>
Figures 2 and 3 shows the results obtained by qualitatively<br>
plotting the component's electric field strengths of the radiation<br>
field E19, the induction field E29 and the quasi-electrostatic field<br>
E39 based on the formulas (8).<br>
However, in Figures 2 and 3, the component's electric field<br>
strengths at a frequency of 1 [MHz] are shown, and in Figure 3, the<br>
component' s electric field strengths shown in Figure 2 are substituted<br>
with indexes (index scale).<br>
Especially apparent from Figure 3, the component electric field<br>
strengths of the radiation field E10, the induction field E29 and the<br>
quasi-electrostatic field E39 are equal at a certain distance r<br>
(hereinafter referred to as a boundary point), and the radiation field<br>
E19 is dominant in the distance from the boundary point. On the contrary,<br>
- 18 -<br>
in the neighbor before the boundary point, the quasi-electrostatic<br>
field E39 is dominant.<br>
At the boundary point, the following formula is established<br>
according to the above formulas (8):<br>
The light velocity c is in the relation shown by the following formula,<br>
where the wavelength is denoted by X, and the frequency is denoted by<br>
The angular frequency oo is in the relation shown by the following<br>
formula:<br>
o&gt;= 2 n f (1 I)<br>
Then, by substituting the formula (10) and the formula (11) into the<br>
formula (9) and rearranging the formula (9), the following formula<br>
is obtained:<br>
According to the formula (12), the distance r from the origin<br>
to the boundary point varies according to the wavelength X. As shown<br>
in Figure 4, the longer the wavelength X is, the wider the range (the<br>
distance r from the origin to the boundary point) where the<br>
quasi-electrostatic field E36 is dominant.<br>
To sum up the above description, the quasi-electrostatic field<br>
E39 is dominant within the range where the if the relative permittivity of the air e is assumed to<br>
be 1 and the wavelength in the air is assumed to be X.<br>
In the present invention, by selecting the range satisfying the<br>
formula (12) when sending and receiving information with the near field<br>
communication approach, the information is sent and received in the<br>
space where the quasi-electrostatic field E38 is dominant.<br>
(1-3) A quasi-electrostatic field and a human body<br>
Though it is necessary to apply current to a human body to cause<br>
the human body to generate a radiation field or an induction field,<br>
it is physically difficult to efficiently apply current to the human<br>
body because the impedance of a human body is very high. It is also<br>
physiologically undesirable to apply current to a human body. As for<br>
static electricity, however, the situation is completely different.<br>
That is, a human body is very often electrified as suggested by<br>
the empirical fact that static electricity is felt in our everyday<br>
life. As it is known that a quasi-electrostatic field is generated<br>
by electrification of the surface of a human body in response to the<br>
movement of the human body, it is not necessary to apply electricity<br>
to a human body to cause the human body to generate a quasi-electrostatic<br>
field but it is only necessary to electrify the human body.<br>
That is, a human body is electrified by extremely little movement<br>
of charge (current); the electrification change is instantaneously<br>
conducted around the surface of the human body; and then an equipotent ial<br>
surface of a quasi-electrostatic field is formed substantially<br>
isotropically from the periphery. Furthermore, within the range<br>
satisfying the above formula (12) where the quasi-electrostatic field<br>
is dominant, the radiation field and the induction field does not have<br>
much influence. Consequently, the human body functions efficiently<br>
Tas an antenna. This has already been confirmed from the results of<br>
the experiments by the applicant.<br>
As a near field communication technology, the present information<br>
is adapted to modulate a quasi-electrostatic field which is<br>
isotropically formed in the neighborhood of a human body by electrifying<br>
the human body according to particular information, and as a result,<br>
form a quasi-electrostatic field having information in the neighborhood<br>
of the human body, through which the information is sent and received.<br>
To sum up the present invention, as described above, it utilizes<br>
the nature of a quasi-electrostatic field and the nature of a human<br>
body; by electrifying the human body within a range where the<br>
quasi-electrostatic field is dominant, the human body is caused to<br>
act as an antenna; and the quasi-electrostatic field consequently<br>
formed in the neighborhood of the human body is used as an information<br>
transmission medium. An embodiment to which the present invention<br>
is applied is now described below.<br>
(2) First embodiment<br>
(2-1) Entire configuration of a communication system according to<br>
a first embodiment<br>
In Figure 5, reference numeral 1 generally denotes the entire<br>
configuration of the communication system according to the first<br>
embodiment. The communication system comprises a ticket checking and<br>
collecting machine 2 provided at a particular station, and a mobile<br>
device of a card shape (hereinafter referred to a card device) 3, which<br>
is inserted in a pocket of the clothes over a human body (hereinafter<br>
referred to as a user) who utilizes the ticket checking and collecting<br>
machine 2.<br>
The ticket checking and collecting machine 2 is provided with<br>
an entrance/exit passage portion 4 installed at a predetermined place<br>
in the station as a passage for the user and an exit door 5 openably<br>
and closably provided at the exist side of the entrance/exit passage<br>
portion 4. There is provided an electrode (hereinafter referred to<br>
as a side-face electrode) 7 at the side face of the entrance side of<br>
the entrance/exit passage portion 4.<br>
The card device 3 is provided with an electrode (hereinafter<br>
referred to as an internal electrode) 8 on one of the surfaces thereof<br>
and an electrode (hereinafter referred to as an external electrode)<br>
9 on the other surface.<br>
The communication system 1 is adapted to activate the card device<br>
3 of the user who is passing through the entrance/exit passage portion<br>
4, perform near field communication between the card device 3 and the<br>
ticket checking and collecting machine 2, and open the exit door 5<br>
which is in a closed condition, if necessary.<br>
(2-2)- Near field communication<br>
The near field communication performed in the communication system<br>
1 is now described below in detail using a figures showing the internal<br>
configuration of the ticket checking and collecting machine 2 and the<br>
internal configuration of the card device 3.<br>
(2-2-1) Activation of a card device<br>
As shown in Figure 6, a control portion 20 of the ticket checking<br>
and collecting machine 2 is adapted to perform overall control of the<br>
ticket checking and collecting machine 2 in accordance with a<br>
predetermined communication processing program and is adapted to switch<br>
a switching section 2 la of a route switching device 21 to a sending<br>
connection edge 21b or a receiving connection edge 21c based on a<br>
predetermined communication clock prestored in an information storage<br>
memory.<br>
A sending portion 23, at a sending timing based on the communication<br>
clock, supplies an alternating signal SI with a predetermined frequency<br>
generated based on an alternating power supply 15, to the side-surface<br>
electrode 7 via the route switching device 21 to generate a<br>
quasi-electrostatic field, which oscillates according to the<br>
alternating signal SI via the side-surface electrode 7.<br>
Specifically, the sending portion 23 is adapted to generate a<br>
quasi-electrostatic field from the side-surface electrode 7 while<br>
preventing a radiation field and an induction field, as described above<br>
with reference to Figures 2 and 3, by generating the alternating signal<br>
SI with a frequency f and supplying the signal SI to the side-surface<br>
electrode 7, the frequency f satisfying the following formula which<br>
is obtained by substituting the above formula (10) into the above formula<br>
(12), with the relative permittivity of the air e assumed to be 1,<br>
the wave length in the air denoted by X, the maximum distance between<br>
the external electrode 9 and the side-face electrode 7 when the card<br>
device 3 and the ticket checking and collecting machine 2 communicate<br>
with each other denoted by r, and the frequency of the alternating<br>
signal SI denoted by f, and rearranging the formula (12) after the<br>
substitution:<br>
In this situation, when the user enters the inside of the<br>
quasi-electrostatic field generated from the side-surface electrode<br>
7 (that is, when the user attempts to pass through the entrance/exit<br>
'passage portion 4), the user within the quasi-electrostatic field is<br>
electrified according to the displacement of the side-surface electrode<br>
7 and thereby acts as an antenna while a quasi-electrostatic field<br>
according to the displacement (hereinafter referred to as an<br>
alternating quasi-electrostatic field) TD isotropically spreads<br>
around the surface of the user.<br>
In this case, as shown in Figure 7, the internal electrode 8 of<br>
the card device 3 carried by the user is statically coupled with the<br>
user to form a capacitor C2 , while the external electrode 9 is statically<br>
coupled with the ground to form a capacitor C3 and statically coupled<br>
with the side-surface electrode 7 (with a potential equivalent to that<br>
of the ground) via the user to form a capacitor Cl.<br>
As a result, as shown in Figure 8, there is formed an electrical<br>
route sequentially via the side-surface electrode 7, the user, the<br>
internal electrode 8 and the external electrode 9, and the external<br>
electrode 9 provides a reference potential for the alternating power<br>
supply 15 in the card device 3 via the electrified user. Thereby,<br>
the voltage of the alternating power supply 15 on the ticket checking<br>
and collecting machine 2 side is applied between the internal electrode<br>
8 and the external electrode 9 in the card device 3 via the electrified<br>
user.<br>
In this case, as shown in Figure 9, the card device 3 connects<br>
a switching section 3 la on the internal electrode 8 side with a receiving<br>
connection edge 31c, and a switching section 31b of the external<br>
electrode 9 with a receiving connection edge 31e; full-wave rectifies<br>
the alternating signal (current) SI generated between the external<br>
electrode 9 and the internal electrode 8 by a rectification circuit<br>
33; and a resultant direct current S2 is stored in a smoothing capacitor<br>
HC as power.<br>
A power supply control portion 32 is adapted to activate the card<br>
device 3 when it detects that the power stored in the smoothing capacitor<br>
HC has reached a predetermined voltage level.<br>
In this way, in the communication system 1, by electrifying a<br>
user to obtain power for the card device 3 from the user functioning<br>
as a huge antenna (electrode), supply of power from the ticket checking<br>
and collecting machine 2 can be assisted, and it is possible, on the<br>
card device 3 side, to obtain power without depending on the electrode<br>
area of the internal electrode 8 and the external electrode 9 and without<br>
providing a battery for the card device 3.<br>
In achieving this, the communication system 1 is adapted to enhance<br>
efficiency of power supply from the ticket checking and collecting<br>
machine 2 to the card device 3 and enable miniaturization of the entire<br>
system and the card device 3 itself.<br>
The card device 3 generates a synchronized clock S3 corresponding<br>
to the communication clock of the ticket checking and collecting machine<br>
2 with a clock generator 34, based on the frequency f of the alternating<br>
signal SI supplied by the ticket checking and collecting machine 2,<br>
and supplies the synchronized clock S3 to a control portion 30.<br>
The control portion 30 is adapted to perform overall control of<br>
the card device 3 in accordance with a predetermined communication<br>
processing program, and switches the switching sections 3la and 31b<br>
of the receiving connection edge 31 based on the synchronized clock<br>
S3 supplied by the clock generator 34.<br>
The control portion 30 is adapted to connect the switching section<br>
3la with the receiving connection edge 3Id and the switching section<br>
31b with a ground connection edge 3If in the case of a sending timing<br>
based on the synchronized clock S3, while it connects the switching<br>
section 3la with the receiving connection edge 31c and the switching<br>
section 31b with the receiving connection edge 31e in the case of a<br>
receiving timing.<br>
(2-2-2) Near field communication from a card device to a ticket<br>
checking and collecting machine<br>
At a sending timing based on the synchronized clock S3, the control<br>
portion 30 reads, from an internal information storage memory (not<br>
shown), identification information S4 identifying whether or not to<br>
permit a user to enter or exit from a station, for example, such as<br>
a station name or train fare, and supplies the information to a sending<br>
portion 35.<br>
The sending portion 35 generates an alternating signal with the<br>
same frequency as that of the ticket checking and collecting machine<br>
2 based on the power stored in the smoothing capacitor HC; performs<br>
modulation processing on the alternating signal in accordance with<br>
a predetermined modulation method to superimpose the identification<br>
information S4 thereon; and supplies a resultant identification signal<br>
S5 between the internal electrode 8 and the external electrode 9 via<br>
the receiving connection edge 31.<br>
In this case, the internal electrode 8 oscillates according to<br>
the frequency of the identification signal S5 and generates a<br>
quasi-electrostatic field (identification signal S5) according to the<br>
oscillation. As a result, the user is electrified in response to the<br>
oscillation of the internal electrode 8, and there is formed a<br>
quasi-electrostatic field (hereinafter referred to as an<br>
information-transmission quasi-electrostatic field) DTD which the<br>
Identification signal S5 has, isotropically around the user according<br>
to the oscillation.<br>
In this case, the user and the side-surface electrode 7 are coupled<br>
with each other by the same action as in the case described with reference<br>
to Figures 7 and 8, and the information-transmission<br>
quasi-electrostatic field DTD is detected by the side-surf ace electrode<br>
7.<br>
In this way, in the sending portion 35, by changing the<br>
electrification condition of the user according to the<br>
quasi-electrostatic field (identification signal S5) generated from<br>
the internal electrode 8, in the space where the radiation field and<br>
the induction field are prevented, as described above in relation to<br>
the formula (12), it is possible to cause the user to act as an antenna<br>
and form an information-transmission quasi-electrostatic field DTD.<br>
In this case, the receiving timing based on the communication<br>
clock is set for the ticket checking and collecting machine 2 (Figure<br>
6), and a field effect transistor (hereinafter referred to as a FET)<br>
28 detects the strength displacement of the information-transmission<br>
quasi-electrostatic field DTD detected by the side-surface electrode<br>
7 as change in potential via the gate of the FET 28, and supplies it<br>
to a receiving portion 24 as an identification signal S6 via an amplifier<br>
(not shown).<br>
The receiving portion 24 performs demodulation processing on the<br>
identification signal S6 in accordance with a predetermined<br>
demodulation method to abstract identification information S7 and<br>
supplies it to a passage determining portion 25 of the control portion<br>
20.<br>
Receiving the identification information S7 from the receiving<br>
portion 24, the passage determining portion 25 performs a predetermined<br>
determination process based on the identification information S7 and<br>
determination information prestored in the information storage memory<br>
and determines whether or not to allow the user, who is attempting<br>
to pass through the entrance/exit passage portion 4 (Figure 5), to<br>
pass it.<br>
When obtaining a positive result that the user should be allowed<br>
to pass, the passage determining portion 25 gives a passage permission<br>
instruction to an exit door control portion 26 and an information<br>
providing portion 27. On the contrary, when obtaining a negative result<br>
that the user should not be allowed to pass, the passage determining<br>
portion 25 gives a passage refusal instruction to the exit door control<br>
portion 26 and the information providing portion 27.<br>
When receiving a passage permission instruction from the passage<br>
determining portion 25, the exit door control portion 26 opens the<br>
exit door 5 of the entrance/exit passage portion 4 (Figure 5) to allow<br>
the user to pass. On the contrary, when receiving a passage refusal<br>
instruction from the passage determining portion 25, the exit door<br>
control portion 26 keeps the exit door 5 of the entrance/exit passage<br>
portion 4 closed to prevent the user from passing.<br>
(2-2-3) Near field communication from a ticket checking and collecting<br>
machine to a card device<br>
Receiving a passage permission instruction or a passage refusal<br>
instruction from the passage determining portion 25, the information<br>
providing portion 27 generates notification information S8 to be<br>
notified to the user, such as permission or passage refusal and other<br>
information, and then supplies the notification information to the<br>
sending portion 23 at a sending timing based on the communication clock.<br>
The sending portion 23 performs modulation processing on the<br>
alternating signal SI in accordance with a predetermined modulation<br>
method to superimpose the notification information S8 thereon, and<br>
supplies a resultant notification signal S9 to the side-surface<br>
electrode 7 via the route switching device 21 to generate a<br>
quasi-electrostatic field, which oscillates according to the<br>
notification signal S9, from the side-surface electrode 7.<br>
Consequently, the sending portion 23 can change the<br>
electrification condition of the user according to the<br>
quasi-electrostatic field (the notification signal S9) to cause the<br>
user to act as an antenna, and form the information-transmission<br>
quasi-electrostatic field DTD in the neighborhood of the user, in the<br>
space where the radiation field and the induction field are prevented<br>
due to induction of the quasi-electrostatic field as described above<br>
with reference to Figures 7 and 8,<br>
In this case, in the card device 3 (Figure 9), the receiving timing<br>
is based on the synchronized clock S3 is set, and the internal electrode<br>
8 detects the information-transmission quasi-electrostatic field DTD<br>
formed in the neighborhood of the user. A FET 37 detects displacement<br>
of the strength of the information-transmission quasi-electrostatic<br>
field DTD detected by the internal electrode 8 as change in potential<br>
via the gate of the FET 37, and supplies it to the receiving portion<br>
24 as the notification signal S9 via an amplifier (not shown).<br>
The receiving portion 24 performs demodulation processing on the<br>
notification signal S9 in accordance with a predetermined demodulation<br>
Method to abstract notification information S10 and supplies it to<br>
the control portion 30.<br>
In this case, the control portion 30 notifies the user of the<br>
contents of the notification information S10, for example, by<br>
displaying the contents via a display portion (not shown) based on<br>
the notification information S10.<br>
In this way, the ticket checking and collecting machine 2 (the<br>
card device 3) can avoid receiving the notification signal S9 (the<br>
identification signal S5) that it has sent via the side-surface<br>
electrode 7 (the internal electrode 8) (so-called signal sneaking)<br>
by performing a half-duplex method in which a sending route and a<br>
receiving route are alternately switched based on the communication<br>
clock (the synchronized clock S3) to send and receive information.<br>
In this case, the ticket checking and collecting machine 2 (the<br>
card device 3) can use both of the function of a electrification-inducing<br>
electrode for electrifying a user and the function of a detection<br>
electrode for detecting .change in the electrification condition of<br>
the user caused by the card device 3 (the ticket checking and collecting<br>
machine 2) with only one side-surface electrode 7 (internal electrode<br>
8), and thereby the ticket checking and collecting machine 2 can be<br>
miniaturized.<br>
Furthermore, the ticket checking and collecting machine 2 can<br>
use one alternating signal SI both for power supply and for information<br>
communication such that one side-surface electrode 7 can be used both<br>
as a sending electrode for a signal for power supply and as a receiving<br>
electrode for a signal for information communication without providing<br>
such electrodes separately, and thereby the ticket checking and<br>
collecting machine 2 can be miniaturized.<br>
4'2-3) Auxiliary means in near field communication<br>
In addition to the above configuration, as shown in Figure 10,<br>
in the communication system 1, a floor surface (hereinafter referred<br>
to as a route floor surface) Yl of the entrance/exit passage portion<br>
4 is provided in such a condition that it is not grounded to the ground<br>
(hereinafter referred to as a building floor surface) Y2 but is separated<br>
from the building floor surface Y2 by predetermined space dx (a gap).<br>
In this case, the electrostatic capacity between the feet of the<br>
user and the building floor surface Y2 can be reduced to be less than<br>
the electrostatic capacity between the user and the side-surface<br>
electrode 7 by the amount corresponding to the space dx between the<br>
route floor surface Yl and the building floor surface Y2, and thereby<br>
leakage of the information-transmission quasi-electrostatic field DTD<br>
(alternating quasi-electrostatic field TD) from the feet to the<br>
building floor surface Y2 can be prevented.<br>
In addition to this, it is also possible to prevent noises<br>
(hereinafter referred to as environmental noises) KN caused by<br>
inconsistency of the building floor surface Y2, such as electrical<br>
discharge noises caused by electrically unstable condition due to a<br>
gap between joint surfaces of steel material in the building floor<br>
surface Y2 or rust of the steel material, from being induced from the<br>
route floor surface Yl to the user.<br>
Thus, in the communication system, it is possible to form, in<br>
a more stable condition, the equipotential surface of an<br>
information-transmission quasi-electrostatic field DTD (an<br>
alternating quasi-electrostatic field TD) which is formed<br>
substantially isotropically from around the surface of the user when<br>
the user is electrified and the electrification change momentarily<br>
"conducts over the periphery of the surface of the user, and therefore<br>
it is possible to stable near field communication.<br>
This will be visually apparent from comparison of Figure 11 showing<br>
the equipotential surface of a quasi-electrostatic field when a human<br>
body functions as an ideal dipole antenna and Figure 12 showing the<br>
results of experiments according to the present embodiment.<br>
Furthermore, as shown in Figure 13, the ticket checking and<br>
collecting machine 2 of the communication system 1 is adapted to prevent<br>
leakage of a signal on the route from the side-surface electrode 7<br>
to the receiving portion 24 via the FET 28. Specifically, first, a<br>
case 28A, a conductor covering the periphery of the FET 28 is provided<br>
in a condition that it is electrically separated from the FET 28; and<br>
second, only the receiving portion 24 is grounded on the receiving<br>
route.<br>
Third, as means for preventing such leakage, the ticket checking<br>
and collecting machine 2 is adapted to reduce the electrostatic capacity<br>
SCI between the FET 2 8 and the ground in comparison with the electrostatic<br>
capacity SC2 on the route from the FET 28 to the receiving portion<br>
24 via the receiving portion 24, for example, by increasing the interval<br>
(height) between the FET 28 and the ground.<br>
Thus, the ticket checking and collecting machine 2 can efficiently<br>
induce the information-transmission quasi-electrostatic field DTD<br>
(alternating quasi-electrostatic field TD) detected by the<br>
side-surface electrode 7 to the receiving portion 24 via the FET 28,<br>
and thereby receive the information-transmission quasi-electrostatic<br>
field DTD (Figure 5) formed by the user with high sensitivity.<br>
(2-4) Operation and effect<br>
In the communication system 1 with the above configuration,<br>
utilizing the nature of a quasi-electrostatic field and the nature<br>
of a user (human body), the user is electrified to act as an antenna,<br>
and a quasi-electrostatic field which is consequently formed in the<br>
neighborhood of the user is used as an information transmission medium.<br>
Specifically, on the card device 3 (the ticket checking and<br>
collecting machine 2) side in the communication system 1, a<br>
quasi-electrostatic field according to the identification signal S5<br>
(the notification signal S9) modulated according to the identification<br>
information S4 (the notification information S8) is generated from<br>
the internal electrode 8 (the side-surface electrode 7) to electrify<br>
the user, as described above with reference to Figures 6 and 9. In<br>
the ticket checking and collecting machine 2 (the card device 3), change<br>
in the strength of an information-transmission quasi-electrostatic<br>
field DTD (Figure 5) isotropically formed in the neighborhood of the<br>
user is detected via the side-surface electrode 7 (the internal<br>
electrode 8) and the FET 28 (the FET 37) sequentially, and the<br>
identification information S4 (the notification information S8) is<br>
demodulated based on the detection result.<br>
Accordingly, in the communication system 1, it is possible to<br>
form an information-transmission quasi-electrostatic field DTD that<br>
spreads substantially isotropically from the surface of the user<br>
according to the identification signal S5 (the notification signal<br>
S9), with the user who is electrified very desirably. Furthermore,<br>
sending and receiving is possible without depending on the way of holding<br>
or mounting the card device 3 and without depending on whether or not<br>
the internal electrode 8 of the card device 3 is in contact with the<br>
user.<br>
Furthermore, in the communication system 1, since the electrified<br>
user is caused to act as an antenna, it is possible to form an<br>
information-transmission quasi-electrostatic field DTD that spreads<br>
isotropically from the surface of the user, irrespective of the movement<br>
of the user, and therefore, it is possible to send and receive information<br>
without forcing the user to perform a predetermined movement in<br>
communication.<br>
Furthermore, in the communication system 1, since the electrified<br>
user is caused to act as an antenna and, via a non-propagating<br>
information-transmission quasi-electrostatic field DTD consequently<br>
formed in the neighborhood of the user, information is sent and received,<br>
it is possible to avoid interference with other radio waves (an induction<br>
field or a radiation field) and avoid interception from outside the<br>
communication space to secure confidentiality of the communication<br>
contents.<br>
In this way, in the communication system 1, by causing the user<br>
intervening between sending and receiving electrodes to act as an<br>
antenna rather than treating the user as a medium as has been done<br>
conventionally, it is possible to realize sending and receiving of<br>
information without directional restrictions in the neighborhood of<br>
the user, with confidentiality secured and without forcing the user<br>
to perform a predetermined movement.<br>
In addition to the above configuration, in the communication system<br>
1, the relation between the maximum distance r and the frequency f<br>
of the signal to be supplied to the side-surface electrode 7 is selected<br>
to satisfy the above formula (13), as described above with reference<br>
to the formula (12).<br>
Accordingly, in the communication system 1, when causing a user<br>
who is going to pass through the entrance/exit passage portion 4 to<br>
act as an antenna to perform near field communication, the communication<br>
space can be formed as space (substantially closed space) where the<br>
non-propagating quasi-electrostatic field E39 is always dominant. As<br>
a result, the communication output can be weakened to the degree that<br>
the communication contents are not propagated outside the communication<br>
space, and thereby confidentiality of the communication contents are<br>
secured more sufficiently.<br>
According to the above configuration, in the communication system<br>
1, utilizing the nature of a quasi-electrostatic field and the nature<br>
of a human body, the user is electrified to act as an antenna, and<br>
an information-transmission quasi-electrostatic field DTD which is<br>
consequently formed in the neighborhood of the user is used as an<br>
information transmission medium. Thus, it is possible to realize<br>
sending and receiving of information without directional restrictions<br>
in the neighborhood of the user, with confidentiality secured and<br>
without forcing the user to perform a predetermined movement, and<br>
thereby the degree of freedom in communication using a<br>
quasi-electrostatic field can be enhanced..<br>
(2-5) Other embodiments<br>
In the first embodiment described above, description has been<br>
made on the case where the card device 3 as a first communication device<br>
is inserted in a pocket of the clothes of a user. The present invention,<br>
however, is not limited thereto, and the card device 3 may be fitted<br>
around the arm as shown in Figure 14. Alternatively, it may be<br>
incorporated in a mobile telephone or a pedometer, or may be put in<br>
a bag. That is, the card device 3 can be provided in the neighborhood<br>
the sending or receiving human body without depending on the way<br>
of holding or mounting it and without depending whether or not the<br>
t<br>
internal electrode 8 of the card device 3 is in contact with the user,<br>
as described above. After all, the only requirement is that the card<br>
device 3 should be in the neighborhood of the user.<br>
Description has been made on the case where the card device 3<br>
is of a card shape in the first embodiment described above. However,<br>
the present invention is not limited thereto, and the card device 3<br>
may be of other various shapes.<br>
Furthermore, in the first embodiment described above, description<br>
has been made on the case where the route floor surface Yl is provided<br>
for the entrance/exit passage portion 4 in a condition that it is<br>
separated from the building floor surface Y2 (Figure 10) by<br>
predetermined space dx. The present invention, however, is not limited<br>
thereto, and a member with a low relative permittivity may be filled<br>
between the route floor surface Yl and the building floor surface Y2.<br>
In this case, if the relative permittivity of the member filled<br>
between the route floor surface Yl and the building floor surface Y2<br>
is assumed to be e, the gap between the route floor surface Yl and<br>
the building floor surface the building floor surface Y2 is assumed<br>
to be dx, the permittivity of vacuum electric constant is assumed to<br>
be eO, and the area of the user's soles is assumed to be S, then the<br>
electrostatic capacity CY2 between the user's feet and the building<br>
floor surface Y2 approximates the value obtained from the relation<br>
represented by the following formula:<br>
therefore, if the distance dx between the route floor surface Yl and<br>
the building floor surface Y2 and the relative permittivity e of the<br>
member filled between the route floor surface Yl and the building floor<br>
surface Y2 are selected in consideration of the above relation, the<br>
electrostatic capacity CY2 between the user's feet and the building<br>
floor surface Y2 can be certainly less than the electrostatic capacity<br>
between the user and the side-surface electrode 7. Thereby, leakage<br>
of the information-transmission quasi-electrostatic field DTD<br>
(alternating quasi-electrostatic field TD) from the user's fee to the<br>
building floor surface Y2 can be prevented more securely, and near<br>
field communication can be stabilized more securely.<br>
In the first embodiment described above, description has been<br>
made on the case where the route floor surface Yl is provided for the<br>
entrance/exit passage portion 4 in a condition that it is separated<br>
from the building floor surface Y2 (Figure 10) by predetermined space<br>
dx, as coupling preventing means for preventing the identification<br>
target and the building floor from being electrically coupled with<br>
each other. The present invention, however, is not limited thereto,<br>
and there may be provided a noise absorption grounding line 40 laid<br>
on the route floor surface Yl and grounded to the building floor surface<br>
Y2, as shown in Figure 16.<br>
In this case, it is possible to prevent such noises (hereinafter<br>
referred to as environmental noises) KN as are caused by inconsistency<br>
of the building floor surface Y2 from being induced from the route<br>
floor surface Yl to the user and thereby stabilize the near field<br>
communication, similarly to the first embodiment described above.<br>
Furthermore, if not only the space dx but also the noise absorption<br>
grounding line 4 0 is provided between the route floor surface Yl (Figure<br>
~~10) and the building floor surface Y2, stabilization of the near field<br>
communication can be enhanced more.<br>
Furthermore, in the first embodiment described above, description<br>
has been made on the case where the side-surface electrode 7 as a<br>
detection electrode and a power supply electrode uses one alternating<br>
signal SI both as a power supply signal and as a carrier signal. The<br>
present invention, however, is not limited thereto, and an electrode<br>
for power supply and an electrode for information communication may<br>
be separately provided.<br>
Specifically, as shown in Figures 16, 17 and 18 in which the port ions<br>
corresponding to the portions in Figures 6, 8 and 9 are denoted by<br>
the same reference numerals and characters, in the ticket checking<br>
and collecting machine 2, there is newly provided a power supply<br>
electrode 51 on the internal surface of the entrance/exit passage<br>
portion 4 at the entrance side, separately from the side-surface<br>
electrode 7, and the alternating power supply 15 is provided between<br>
the power supply electrode 51 and the ground. The side-surface<br>
electrode 7 is used only for near field communication. In the card<br>
device 3, there is provided an internal receiving electrode 52 and<br>
an internal sending electrode 53 on one surface and an external receiving<br>
electrode 54 and an external sending electrode 55 on the other surface,<br>
instead of the route switching device 31. If sending and receiving<br>
on the power supply route and sending and receiving on the information<br>
communication route are separately performed between the ticket<br>
checking and collecting machine 2 and the card device 3 as described<br>
above, the same effect as that of the above-mentioned embodiment can<br>
be obtained.<br>
Furthermore, in the first embodiment described above/ description<br>
has been made on the case where change in the electrification condition<br>
 (an information-transmission quasi-electrostatic field DTD) of a user<br>
that the side-surface electrode 7 as a detection electrode has detected,<br>
is detected as identification information S7 by the FET 28 as detection<br>
means, and the identification information S7 is demodulated by the<br>
receiving portion 24 as modulation means. The present invention,<br>
however, is not limited thereto, and the identification information<br>
S7 may be demodulated by measuring change in the impedance of the<br>
information-transmission quasi-electrostatic field DTD.<br>
Specifically, as shown in Figure 19 in which the portions<br>
corresponding to those in Figure 6 are denoted by the same reference<br>
numerals, the ticket checking and collecting machine 2 supplies the<br>
alternating signal Si with a predetermined frequency generated based<br>
on the alternating power supply 15, to the side-surface electrode 7<br>
via the route switching device 21, using the sending portion 23 to<br>
generate a quasi-electrostatic field. Consequently, a receiving<br>
portion 60 as demodulation and impedance measuring means can obtain<br>
the same effect as that of the embodiment described above.<br>
Furthermore, in the first embodiment described above, description<br>
has been made on the case where change in the electrification condition<br>
of a user is detected by the FET 28 or 37 as an identification signal<br>
S6 (notification signal S9). The present invention, however, is not<br>
limited thereto, and the change in the electrification condition of<br>
the user may be detected by various other detection means such as an<br>
induction-electrode-type field strength meter for measuring the<br>
voltage induced by induction voltage by means of configuration with<br>
a transistor or a FET, an induction-electrode-type<br>
modulation-amplification-system field strength meter for AC<br>
converting a direct signal obtained by an induction electrode using<br>
a chopper circuit, oscillation capacity and the like, an<br>
electro-optic-effect-type field strength meter for applying en<br>
electric field to material having an electro-optic effect to measure<br>
change in the light propagation characteristics caused in the material,<br>
and, only for the card device 3, an electrometer, a shunt-resistor-type<br>
field strength meter, a current-collection-type field strength meter<br>
and the like.<br>
Furthermore, in the first embodiment described above, description<br>
hasbeenmadeon the case where the alternating signal SI is continuously<br>
supplied by the sending portion 23 as modulation and power supply means<br>
to the side-surface electrode 7. The present invention, however, is<br>
not limited thereto, and the alternating signal SI may be supplied<br>
to the side-surface electrode 7 only while the side-surface electrode<br>
7 as a detection electrode detects field displacement caused by the<br>
user according to the user's walking motion when the user is coming<br>
near to the entrance/exit passage portion 4.<br>
Specifically, the ticket checking and collecting machine 2, under<br>
the control of the control portion 20, connects the switching section<br>
2la of the route switching device 21 with the receiving connection<br>
edge 21c until it detects-a user who is going to pass through the<br>
entrance/exit passage portion 4 (Figure 5), detects displacement of<br>
the walking quasi-electrostatic field caused by the user coming near<br>
to the entrance/exit passage portion 4, via the side-surface electrode<br>
7 and the FET 28 sequentially, and, when sending the detection result<br>
to the sending portion 23, connects the switching section 21a with<br>
the sending connection edge by the control portion 20 to give the<br>
alternating signal SI to the side-surface electrode 7. On the other<br>
hand, when the ticket checking and collecting machine 2 cannot detect<br>
the displacement of the walking quasi-electrostatic field caused by<br>
the user going away from the entrance/exit passage portion 4, via the<br>
side-surface electrode 7 and the FET 28 sequentially, and therefore<br>
does not send the detection result to the sending portion 23 any more,<br>
it connects the switching section 2 la with the receiving connection<br>
edge 21c again by the control portion 20 and stops supply of the<br>
alternating signal SI to the side-surf ace electrode 7. Thus, the ticket<br>
checking and collecting machine 2 does not supply the alternating signal<br>
SI to the side-surface electrode 7 except while it detects the<br>
displacement of the walking quasi-electrostatic field<br>
(electrification) caused by the user's walking motion, and thereby<br>
energy saving can be more enhanced in comparison to the embodiment<br>
described above.<br>
Furthermore, in the first embodiment described above, description<br>
has been made on the case where near field communication is performed<br>
between the card device 3 as a first communication device of j a mobile<br>
type provided in the neighborhood of a user, and the ticket checking<br>
and collecting machine 2 as a second communication device provided<br>
at a predetermined control target. The present invention, however,<br>
is not limited thereto, and near field communication may be performed<br>
between a card device 3 provided on one user and a card device 3 provided<br>
on the other card device 3 via the one or the other user. In .this<br>
case, the number of users (human bodies) via which the near field<br>
communication is performed from the card device 3 provided on the one<br>
user to the card device 3 provided on the other user may be any number.<br>
""In this case, the same effect as that of the embodiment described above<br>
can be obtained.<br>
Furthermore, in the first embodiment described above, description<br>
has been made on the case where the ticket checking and collecting<br>
machine 2 is applied to the present invention as a second communication<br>
device provided at a predetermined control target. The present<br>
invention, however, is not limited thereto, and a second communication<br>
device provided on or near a video tape recorder, a television set,<br>
electronics such as a mobile telephone or a personal computer, medical<br>
equipment, an automobile, a desk, and other control targets to be<br>
controlled, for example. In this case the same effect as that of the<br>
embodiment described above can be obtained.<br>
Furthermore, in the first embodiment described above, description<br>
has been made on the case where a human body is applied to the present<br>
invention as an identification target. The present invention, however,<br>
is not limited thereto, and organisms such as mammals, reptiles, plants,<br>
even predetermined conductive material, and any other object with an<br>
electrification properties to be identified may be broadly applied<br>
to the present invention as an identification target.<br>
Furthermore, in the first embodiment described above, description<br>
has been made on the case where the present invention is applied to<br>
the communication system 1 which opens the exit door 5 as necessary<br>
for allowing entrance into or exit from the entrance/exit passage<br>
portion 4 as a communication route. The present invention, however,<br>
is not limited thereto and can be broadly applied to communication<br>
systems for various other purposes, such as a communication system<br>
for opening a door as necessary for allowing entrance into or exit<br>
from the entrance/exit passage of a company, a communication system<br>
'with a communication route in the neighborhood of the desk, for opening<br>
the door of a desk as necessary when a user comes near to the desk,<br>
a communication system with a communication route in the neighborhood<br>
of a personal computer, for powering on the personal computer when<br>
a user comes near to the personal computer, and a communication system<br>
using the conveyance passage for conveying a predetermined<br>
identification target as a communication route, for switching the<br>
conveyance passage as necessary when the identification target is<br>
conveyed to a predetermined position, that is, any communication system<br>
that electrifies a human body to cause the human body to act as an<br>
antenna and performs sending and receiving of information using a<br>
quasi-electrostatic field formed in the neighborhood of the human body<br>
as an information transmission medium.<br>
(3) Second embodiment<br>
(3-1) Entire configuration of a communication system according to<br>
a second embodiment<br>
In Figure 20, reference numeral 100 denotes the entire<br>
communication system according to a second embodiment, which comprises<br>
a voice reproducer 102 inserted in a hip pocket of clothes over a human<br>
body and a headphone device 103 fitted on the head of the human body.<br>
The voice reproducer 102 is of a card shape, and there is provided<br>
a parallel plate electrode portion (hereinafter referred to as a sending<br>
electrode portion) 105 comprising a sending electrode 105a and a<br>
reference electrode 105b paired with the sending electrode 105a within<br>
the voice reproducer 102.<br>
In this case, the voice reproducer 102 reproduces a voice signal<br>
from a voice storage medium and generates a quasi-electrostatic field<br>
'modulated according to the reproduced voice signal from the sending<br>
electrode portion 105 and thereby electrifies the human body.<br>
The headphone device 103 comprises a hair band portion 103A and<br>
a pair of ear pad portions 103L and 103R provided at the ends of the<br>
hair band portion 103A. The hair band portion 103A is provided with<br>
a parallel plate electrode portion (hereinafter referred to as a<br>
receiving electrode portion) 106 comprising a receiving electrode 106a<br>
located generally at the center thereof and a reference electrode 106b<br>
paired with the receiving electrode 106a.<br>
In this case, the headphone device 103 detects change in the<br>
electrification condition of the human body electrified by the voice<br>
reproducer 102 as change in the electric field near the receiving<br>
electrode portion 106, specifically the potential difference between<br>
the electrodes 106a and 106b of the receiving electrode portion 106,<br>
demodulates a voice signal obtained as the result, and then outputs<br>
voice based on the voice signal from speakers (not shown) included<br>
in the ear pad portions 102L and 102R.<br>
As described above, the communication system 100 is adapted to<br>
detect a quasi-electrostatic field generated from the sending electrode<br>
portion 105 of the voice reproducer 102 as the potential difference<br>
between the electrodes 106a and 106b of the receiving electrode portion<br>
106 of the headphone device 103 to enable near field communication<br>
of a voice signal to be performed via a human body.<br>
In the first embodiment described above, near field communication<br>
is performed by utilizing the potential difference between the<br>
electrode provided on the human body (the internal electrode 8) and<br>
the electrode (the side-surface electrode 7) provided at a<br>
predetermined place (on the entrance/exit passage portion 4). However,<br>
justice the phases of the signal which reaches the device on the receiving<br>
side via the human body and the signal received from the electrode<br>
of the device on the receiving side via the electric field formed in<br>
the air are physically opposite, the signals counteract with each other,<br>
and therefore sometimes they cannot be received.<br>
Especially on the sending side, an induction field and a radiation<br>
field, which are not easily attenuate relative to the distance in<br>
comparison with a quasi-electrostatic field, cause waste of sending<br>
power, and the merit of being "difficult to propagate far", a<br>
characteristic of near field communication, cannot be obtained due<br>
to these fields.<br>
Therefore, in this embodiment, in the communication 100, the voice<br>
reproducer 102 as a transmitter and the headphone device 103 as a receiver<br>
are designed such that the radiation field and the induction field<br>
are to be below the noise: floor level and the potential difference<br>
between the electrodes 106a and 106bof the receiving electrode portion<br>
106, at a position where use of the receiving electrode portion 106<br>
is assumed, exceeds a level detectable by a preamplifier 121.<br>
Consequently, the communication system 100 can optimize energy<br>
required for near field communication to be performed by the transmitter<br>
and the receiver (the voice reproducer 102 and the headphone device<br>
103), and can prevent unnecessary propagation and improve spatial<br>
resolution to enforce stabilization of communication.<br>
(3-2) Configuration of a voice reproducer<br>
The voice reproducer 102 comprises a voice reproducing portion<br>
111, a modulation processing portion 112, an amplifier 113 and a sending<br>
electrode portion 105, as shown in Figure 21.<br>
The sending electrode portion 105 is of an electrode structure<br>
(electrode shape, electrode area and distance between electrodes)<br>
selected in accordance with a designing approach for a transmitter<br>
and a receiver and a transmitter to be described later. Specifically,<br>
it is formed in an electrode structure according to the reference<br>
frequency such that the strength of the induction field component of<br>
a generated electric field is below the noise floor specified according<br>
to the communication band.<br>
The voice reproducing portion 111 reproduces a voice signal SI<br>
from a voice storage medium mounted on a mounting portion not shown,<br>
and sends the reproduced voice signal SI to the modulation processing<br>
portion 112.<br>
The modulation processing portion 112 comprises a signal supplying<br>
portion 112a and a modulating portion 112b. For the signal supplying<br>
portion 112a, a potential corresponding to a prespecif ied originating<br>
frequency (working frequency) is set as the potential of a voltage<br>
signal to be applied to the sending electrode portion 105.<br>
The signal supplying portion 112a is adapted to supply a voltage<br>
signal with the specified originating frequency and potential to the<br>
modulating portion 112b at a predetermined timing. The modulating<br>
portion 112b is adapted to perform modulation process ing on the voltage<br>
signal in accordance with a predetermined modulation method to<br>
superimpose the voice signal SI thereon and apply the resultant<br>
modulated signal to the sending electrode 105a of the sending electrode<br>
portion 105 via the amplifier 113.<br>
In this case, the sending electrode 105a oscillates according<br>
to the originating frequency of the modulated signal S2; the human<br>
body is electrified by a quasi-electrostatic field which has been<br>
generated in response to the oscillation; and as a result, there is<br>
formed a quasi-electrostatic field according to the oscillation, almost<br>
isotropically around the human body.<br>
In this way, the voice reproducer 102 is adapted to send information<br>
(a voice signal) via a human body.<br>
(3-3) Configuration of a headphone device<br>
The headphone device 103 comprises a receiving electrode portion<br>
106, a preamplifier 121, a demodulating portion 122, a voice amplifying<br>
portion 123 (123L and 123R) and speaker 124 (124L and 124R), as shown<br>
Figure 22.<br>
The receiving electrode portion 106 is formed in an electrode<br>
structure selected in accordance with a designing approach for a<br>
transmitter and a receiver to be described later. Specifically, it<br>
is formed such that the strength of the induction field component of<br>
a generated electric field is below the noise floor specified according<br>
to the communication band, without depending on the electrode area,<br>
arid with a distance between electrodes according to the reference<br>
frequency.<br>
The preamplifier 121 detects the potential difference between<br>
the electrodes 106a and 106b of the receiving electrode portion 106<br>
and sends it to the demodulating portion 122 as a modulated signal<br>
S2. It is desirable to use a preamplifier with a high input resistance<br>
as the preamplifier 121 since an input signal of a preamplifier is<br>
generally weak.<br>
The demodulating portion 122 performs demodulation processing<br>
on the modulated signal S2 supplied by the demodulating portion 122<br>
in accordance with a predetermined demodulation method and thereby<br>
generates a voice signal SI. It then sends the voice signal SI to<br>
the speaker 124 (124L and 124R) via voice amplifying portion 123 (123L<br>
and 123R).<br>
i<br>
As a result, a voice based on the voice signal SI is outputted<br>
from the speaker 124 (124L and 124R).<br>
As described above, the headphone device 103 is adapted to release<br>
a voice based on the voice signal SI sent from the voice reproducer<br>
102.<br>
(3-4) A designing method for a transmitter and a receiver<br>
Description is now made on a designing method for the voice<br>
reproducer 102 as a transmitter and the headphone device 103 as a<br>
receiver.<br>
(3-4-1) Designing parameters<br>
First, designing parameters in designing a transmitter and a<br>
receiver (the voice reproducer 102 and the headphone device 103) are<br>
now described below.<br>
The transmitter and the receiver are designed with the following<br>
(A) and (B) as a guideline (hereinafter referred to as a designing<br>
guideline): (A) the induction field generated from the sending<br>
electrode portion 105 should be controlled to be below the noise floor;<br>
and (B) the potential obtained between the electrodes 106a and 106b<br>
of the receiving electrode portion 106 should be higher than the noise<br>
of the preamplifier 121 (Figure 16) itself mounted on the receiver<br>
(the headphone device 103).<br>
To design a transmitter and a receiver to satisfy the designing<br>
guideline, the following various designing parameters are selected<br>
in this descending order of importance as preprocessing for designing:<br>
(a) the originating frequency and the communication band, (b) the<br>
electrode area (including the electrode shape; hereinafter the same)<br>
end the distance between electrodes in the sending electrode portion<br>
105, and the electrode area and the distance between electrodes in<br>
the receiving electrode portion 106, (c) the positions of the sending<br>
electrode portion 105 and the receiving electrode portion 106 on a<br>
human body, and (d) the preamplifier 121.<br>
Actually, in selecting the various designing parameters (a) to<br>
(d), various conditions (hereinafter referred to designing conditions),<br>
such as the application of the communication system, the communication<br>
application used for communication, and even the space area enough<br>
for mounting the sending electrode portion 105 (the receiving electrode<br>
portion 106) onto the voice reproducer 102 (the headphone device 103),<br>
are taken into consideration.<br>
(3-4-2) Potential between electrodes in a receiving electrode portion<br>
Description will be now made on the potential generated between<br>
the receiving electrode 106a and the reference electrode 106b of the<br>
receiving electrode portion 106 (hereinafter referred to as potential<br>
between electrodes).<br>
The potential between electrodes of the receiving electrode<br>
portion 106 is an important element that means, so to speak,<br>
communication performance. The potential between electrodes was<br>
simulated with the FDTD method (Finite Difference Time Domain: a method<br>
for solving the Maxwell equation, which is a basic electromagnetic<br>
equation, with a finite difference and a time domain).<br>
Specifically, the simulation was performed in the condition that<br>
the sending electrode portion 105 is arranged at a position<br>
corresponding to a hip pocket of a human body model and the receiving<br>
electrode portion 106 is arranged at a position corresponding to the<br>
top of the head, as shown in Figure 23, under the assumption that voltage<br>
lof 1 [V] is applied at 100 [MHz] between the electrodes of the sending<br>
electrode portion 105, and under various other conditions. The results<br>
of the simulation are shown in Figures 24 to 27.<br>
Figure 24 shows the relation between the electrode area of the<br>
receiving electrode portion 106 and the potential between electrodes<br>
of the receiving electrode portion 106. In this case, the electrode<br>
area of the sending electrode portion 105 was fixed at 8x4 [cm2]; the<br>
distance between electrodes of the sending electrode portion 105 at<br>
2 [cm]; and the distance between electrodes of the receiving electrode<br>
portion 106 at 1 [cm].<br>
As apparent from Figure 24, even if the electrode area of the<br>
receiving electrode portion 106 changes, the potential between the<br>
electrodes is almost constant. This means that it is possible to secure<br>
stabilization of communication even if, in designing a transmitter<br>
and a receiver, the electrode area of the receiving electrode portion<br>
106 on the receiver side is reduced.<br>
Figure 25 shows the distance between electrodes of the receiving<br>
electrode portion 106 and the potential between electrodes of the<br>
receiving electrode portion 106. The electrode area of the sending<br>
electrode portion 105 was fixed at 8x4 [cm2], the distance between<br>
electrodes of the sending electrode portion 105 at 2 [cm]; and the<br>
electrode area of the receiving electrode portion 106 at 4x4 [cm2].<br>
As apparent from Figure 25, if the distance between electrodes<br>
of the receiving electrode portion 106 is denoted by dR [m] and the<br>
potential between electrodes of the receiving electrode portion 106<br>
is denoted by VR [ V], the distance between electrode dR and the potential<br>
between electrodes VR are in the relation represented by the following<br>
equation.<br>
electrodes of the sending electrode portion 105 at 2 [cm]; and the<br>
electrode area of the receiving electrode portion 106 at 4x4 [cm2].<br>
As apparent from Figure 25, if the distance between electrodes<br>
of the receiving electrode portion 106 is denoted by dR [m] and the<br>
potential between electrodes of the receiving electrode portion 106<br>
is denoted by VR [V] , the distance between electrode dE and the<br>
potential between electrodes VE are in the relation represented by<br>
VE(dB) = 0.00088dR - 0.00034. Since the potential between electrodes<br>
y is less affected by the constant term 0 . 00034 but is greatly affected<br>
by change of the distance between electrode dRf the constant term can<br>
be omitted. As a result f the distance between electrode dR and the<br>
potential between electrodes VR [a*e] can be in the relation<br>
represented by the following equation.<br>
= 0.0005..... (15)]<br>
VR(dR) = 0.00088dR ..... (15)<br>
Furthermore, Figure 26 shows the relation between the electrode<br>
area of the sending electrode portion 105 and the potential between<br>
electrodes of the receiving electrode portion 106. In this case, the<br>
distance between electrodes of the sending electrode portion 105 was<br>
fixed at 2 [cm] ; the electrode area of the receiving electrode portion<br>
106 at 4x4 [cm2] ; and the distance between electrodes of the receiving<br>
electrode portion 106 at 1 [cm].<br>
As apparent from Figure 26, the relation between the potential<br>
between electrodes of the receiving electrode portion 106 [ic in<br>
proportion to] and the electrode area of the sending electrode portion<br>
105 is approximately a proportional relation.<br>
Figure 27 shows the relation between the distance between<br>
electrodes of the sending electrode portion 105 and the potential<br>
between electrodes of the receiving electrode portion 106. In this<br>
case, the electrode area of the sending electrode portion 105 was<br>
fixed at 8x4 [cm2]; the electrode area of the receiving electrode<br>
portion 106 at 4x4 [cm2]; and the distance between electrodes of the<br>
receiving electrode portion 106 at 1 [cm].<br>
As apparent from Figure 27, the relation between the potential<br>
between electrodes of the receiving electrode portion 106 [io in<br>
proportion to] and the distance between electrodes of the sending<br>
electrode portion 105 is approximately a proportional relation.<br>
From the above simulation results (Figures 24 to 27), if the<br>
distance between electrodes of the receiving electrode portion 106<br>
is denoted by dR [m] , the electrode area of the sending electrode<br>
portion 105 by As [m2] , the distance between electrodes of the sending<br>
electrode portion 105 by ds [m] , and the potential (hereinafter<br>
referred to as applied potential) to be applied between the sending<br>
electrode 105a and the reference electrode 105b of the sending<br>
electrode portion 105 is denoted by Vs [V] , then the potential between<br>
electrodes VR [V] of the receiving electrode portion 106 is shown by<br>
the following formula:<br>
(16)<br>
The reason why the electrode area of the receiving electrode<br>
portion 106 is not considered in the above formula (16) is that the<br>
potential between electrodes VR [V] of the receiving electrode portion<br>
106 does not depend on the electrode area, as shown in Figure 24.<br>
In the above formula (16), the constant a is the potential<br>
gradient between the electrodes of the receiving electrode portion<br>
106 relative to the potential applied to the sending electrode portion<br>
105 and is a constant depending on the setting parameters (b) and<br>
(c) selected in consideration of the designing conditions (the<br>
constant is hereinafter referred to as a parameter dependent<br>
constant).<br>
The potential Vs applied to the sending electrode portion 105<br>
depends on the frequency f and, therefore, is actually represented<br>
by the following formula.<br>
"telectric field simulator only if the setting parameters (b) and (c)<br>
are selected.<br>
4<br>
That is, each of a human body model and the contents of the setting<br>
parameters (b) and (c) is defined in an electromagnetic field simulator,<br>
and then, by causing excitation between the electrodes 105a and 105b<br>
of the sending electrode portion 105 by a signal with a certain frequency<br>
and a predetermined amplitude, the potential between electrodes VR<br>
(f) generated at the receiving electrode portion 106 is calculated<br>
through simulation.<br>
Here, since all the elements of the formula (17) are known except<br>
for the parameter depending constant a, the parameter depending<br>
constant a can be determined by substituting the known values into<br>
the formula (17).<br>
For example, in the case where, as the various conditions for<br>
the simulation in Figures 24 to 27, the electrode area As of the sending<br>
electrode portion 105 is assumed to be 8x4 [cm2], the distance between<br>
electrodes ds of the sending electrode portion 105 is assumed to be<br>
2 [cm], the distance between electrodes dR of the receiving electrode<br>
portion 106 is assumed to be 2 [cm], the potential Vs (f) to be applied<br>
to the sending electrode portion 105 is assumed to be 1 [V] with a<br>
single frequency, the sending electrode portion 105 is assumed to be<br>
positioned at a hip pocket, and the receiving electrode portion 106<br>
is assumed to be positioned at the head top of a human body, the potential<br>
between electrodes VR (f) generated at the receiving electrode portion<br>
106 is 0.0005 [V] as shown in the simulation result in Figure 25 and<br>
in the formula (15). Then, by substituting the corresponding values<br>
into the formula (17), 0.0005 = axlxO.0032x0.02x0.01 is obtained, and<br>
portion 106 is assumed to be 2 [cm], the potential Vs (f) to be applied<br>
to the sending electrode portion 105 is assumed to be 1 [V] with a<br>
single frequency, the sending electrode portion 105 is assumed to<br>
be positioned at a hip pocket, and the receiving electrode portion<br>
106 is assumed to be positioned at the head top of a human body, the<br>
potential between electrodes VR (f) generated at the receiving<br>
electrode portion 106 is [0.0005] 0.00088 [V] as shown in the<br>
simulation result in Figure 25 and in the formula (15). Then, by<br>
substituting the corresponding values into the formula (17), [0.0005]<br>
0.00088 = axlxO.0032x0.02x0.01 is obtained, and consequently the<br>
parameter depending constant a can be determined to be [781^25] 1375.<br>
As described above, the parameter depending constant a based on<br>
the selected setting parameters (b) and (c) can be determined from<br>
the electric field simulator and the formula (17). However, there<br>
is a certain correspondence relationship between the frequency and<br>
the distance between the sending and receiving sides, and therefore,<br>
the setting parameter (c) is determined to some extent if once the<br>
originating frequency of the setting parameters (a) is determined.<br>
(3-4-4) Maximum potential applicable to a sending electrode portion<br>
When designing a transmitter and a receiver with the setting<br>
parameters (a) to (c), the setting parameter (d) (the potential to<br>
be supplied to the sending electrode portion 105) is determined such<br>
that the strength of the induction field component of the electric<br>
field generated from the sending electrode portion 105 is below the<br>
noise floor. The maximum potential applicable to the sending<br>
electrode portion 105 will be described here.<br>
The electric field strength E at the position r in the<br>
neighborhood of an electric field source (the sending electrode<br>
portion 105 ) in free space at time t can be represented as the following<br>
formula, by rearranging the formula (2 ) under the assumption of "coscot<br>
= 1" , at which the electric strength E is the maximum, and under the<br>
assumption of 6 = ji/2 for simplification of the discussion:<br>
The received power p [W] received by an antenna [ (tho receiving<br>
electrode portion 106)] with an aperture area K [m2] is represented<br>
by the following formula:<br>
4/r<br>
(19)<br>
where the received power density is denoted by S [W/m2] The received<br>
power density S [W/m2] in the relation with the received electric<br>
strength E is represented by the following formula:<br>
Based on the induction filed component of the electric field<br>
the component S2 for the induction field of the power density is<br>
represented by the following formula;<br>
[Accordingly, the received power p [mW] io roprcacntcd by the<br>
following formula obtained by substituting tho formula (20) into the<br>
Accordingly, the induction field component p of the received<br>
power is as follows;<br>
(23)<br>
[By oubotituting the formula (18) for the "W in the formula (21)<br>
to determine the product ql of the charge q and the distance 1 from<br>
tho charge of a microdipolo ouch that the product ql is below the<br>
noise floor nf [dBm] by 10 [dB] at the position r in the neighborhood<br>
of tho clitoris field source (the Bonding electrode portion 105)/<br>
the following formula io obtained;<br>
The formulas (20) and (21) are substituted for the E. <br>
the formula (23), respectively, and the product ql of the charge g<br>
of a microdipole and the distance 1 between two charges of the<br>
microdipole is obtained so that the induction field component p<br>
becomes smaller than the noise floor nf [dBm] by 10 [dB] at a distance<br>
of r from the electric field source (microdipole). Since<br>
f by rearranging the following equation;<br>
[The maximum value of the product ql (hereinafter referred to ao the<br>
maximum product) ql, io shown in the following formula;]<br>
r the maximum value of the product ql (hereinafter referred to as<br>
the maximum product) qlnis obtained.<br>
And/ the maximum product ql can bo obtained from the following<br>
formula obtained by rearranging the above formula.]<br>
*"" V 1000 -K Re(jkr-exp(-jkr))<br>
In this formula (24) , a function Re is used to represent the real<br>
part of the complex number.<br>
The noise floor nf is defined by the following formula:<br>
nf = -174lilBm/EIz] + NF+101ogB[dBm] (25)<br>
where NF is a noise index and B [Hz] is a communication band.<br>
Practically, for example, in the case where the frequency f is<br>
4 [MHz], the noise index NF is 10 [dB], the communication band B is<br>
100 [kHz], the aperture area K of the receiving electrode portion<br>
106 is 0.03 [m2], and 6 = rc/2, it is apparent from the formula (24)<br>
that the output of an induction field at a distance of 0.05 [m] from<br>
the sending electrode portion 105 can be below the noise floor nf<br>
(= -174+10+10 log (1000000) = 114 [dBm]) if the maximum product ql<br>
is [1.510"] fllnflj,. =6.28 X IP"15. However, actually, if the product<br>
ql satisfies "qKqlmax"/ then the induction field component at a<br>
neighbor position r at a distance of 0.05 [m] from the sending<br>
electrode portion 105 can be below the noise floor<br>
Here, confirmation will be now made on the relation of the<br>
communication distance with the electric field strength of the<br>
Composite electric field comprising the quasi-electrostatic field,<br>
the induction field and the radiation field, and with the electric<br>
field strength only of the induction field.<br>
That is, by substituting 6 = at/2 and qlmax = [1.5x10"**] 6.28 X<br>
10"15 into the formula (18), the electric field strength E (E8) of the<br>
composite electric field is represented by the following formula:<br>
By substituting to the formula (26) the permittivity of vacuum<br>
electric constant e = 8.85e-12, the frequency [f = 4] f=4e6f and the<br>
wavelength k = 2rcf/c (c: light velocity), the electric field strength<br>
E of the composite electric field and the neighbor distance r from<br>
the electric field source can be plotted in the relation shown in<br>
Figure 28.<br>
The electric field strength E of the induction field component,<br>
defined by the following formula:<br>
and the neighbor distance r from the electric field source can be<br>
plotted in the relation shown in Figure 29.<br>
As apparent from comparison of Figure 28 and Figure 29, it can<br>
be confirmed that the strength of the induction field is sufficiently<br>
smaller in comparison with the quasi-electrostatic field at the<br>
position r in the neighborhood of the electric field source (the<br>
sending electrode portion 105) . Since the strength of the radiation<br>
field not shown in Figures 28 and 29 is smaller than that of the<br>
induction field at the neighbor position r, it is apparently smaller<br>
than the strength of the quasi-electrostatic field.<br>
[In this way/ — if the frequency f/ the noise indox NF/ the<br>
communication band B/ tho aperture area K of the receiving electrode<br>
portion 106 and the neighbor position r from the Bonding electrode<br>
portion 105 are cpccifically determined] If the frequency f , the noise<br>
index NFf the communication band B, a distance r between the sending<br>
electrode portion 105 and the neighbor position,, and the aperture<br>
area K of the virtual antenna for evaluating power at the neighbor<br>
position are specifically determined, the maximum product of the<br>
charge q and the distance 1 from the charge of the microdipole and<br>
can be determined from the formula (24).<br>
The maximum product ql, corresponds to the maximum potential<br>
applicable to the sending electrode portion 105. Therefore, if the<br>
applied potential Vs (As, ds/ f ) to be applied to the sending electrode<br>
portion 105 can be determined using an electric field simulator such<br>
that the electric field with an electrode area As selected as the<br>
setting parameter (b) and a distance between electrodes ds, generated<br>
from the sending electrode portion 105, substantially corresponds<br>
to the curve in Figure 28, which obtained as a result of plotting<br>
based on the formula (26), then the strength of the induction field<br>
can be below the noise floor nf at a limit position rnaighbor (= neighbor<br>
distance r) in the communication range with the sending electrode<br>
portion 105 as the center thereof.<br>
For example, when a sending electrode portion 105 with an<br>
electrode area As of 4x4 [cm2] and a distance between electrodes ds<br>
of 4 [cm] was arranged in free space, and a potential of 1 [V] was<br>
applied to the sending electrode portion 105 with a single frequency<br>
f0, the electric field generated from the sending electrode portion<br>
105 multiplied by [0.002] 0.084 almost corresponded to the curve of<br>
figure 28.<br>
This means that, if a potential Vs of [0.002] 0.084 [V] (0.04x0.04,<br>
0.04, f0) is applied to the sending electrode portion 105, the strength<br>
of the induction field at a limit position rneighbor in the communication<br>
range with the sending electrode portion 105 as the center thereof<br>
is below the noise floor nf.<br>
From this, the maximum potential (hereinafter referred to as<br>
maximum applicable potential) AVSmax (As, ds, f) which can be applied<br>
to the sending electrode portion 105 and which corresponds to the<br>
maximum qlmeix (f) depending on the frequency f is represented by the<br>
following formula:<br>
where the single frequency used in the simulation by the electric<br>
field simulator is denoted by f „ and the potential to be obtained which<br>
has been obtained by the simulation is denoted by Vs (As, ds/ f0).<br>
As an example, when the conditions of the simulation results (the<br>
potential Vs (0.04x0.04, 0.04, 4) applied to the sending electrode<br>
portion 105 with an electrode area As of 4x4 [cm2] and a distance between<br>
electrodes ds of 4 [cm] was [0.002] 0.084 [V]) are added to the<br>
conditions in the case where the maximum product qlmax is assumed to<br>
be [-tr^tfW1*] 6.28xlO"15 from the formula (24) (the single frequency<br>
F0 is 4 [MHz], the noise index NF is 10 [dB], the communication band<br>
B is 100 [kHz] , the aperture area K of [the receiving electrode portion<br>
the antenna used for evaluating power at a distance of 0.05 Fml<br>
is 0.03 [m2] and 9 = Jt/2), by substituting the values into the<br>
corresponding terms, in the formula (28), the maximum applicable<br>
potential is represented by the following formula:<br>
[ AVfrmax - (0.001 x 0.001 ,0.001 /)<br>
Figure 30 shows the relation between the frequency f and the maximum<br>
applicable potential AVSmax (0.04x0.04, 0.04, f) based on the above<br>
formula (29). As apparent from Figure 30, the electric field strength<br>
of the induction field at a distance of 5 [cm] from the electric field<br>
source (the sending electrode portion 105) can be below the noise<br>
floor at any frequency t.<br>

When a preamplifier 121 with a voltage noise of n [V/7~Hz] is<br>
mounted on the headphone device 103, the preamplifier 121 is able to<br>
detect a signal with a potential n/J~B [V] relative to a communication<br>
band B [Hz].<br>
Accordingly, the preamplifier 121 can be selected to satisfy the<br>
following formula:<br>
To sum up the description above, designing for a transmitter and<br>
a receiver (the voice reproducer 102 and the headphone device 103)<br>
can be performed in accordance with the designing procedure RT in Figure<br>
31.<br>
That is, selection of (a) the originating frequency f and the<br>
communication band B, (b) the electrode area As and the distance between<br>
electrodes ds of the sending electrode portion 105 and the distance<br>
between electrodes dR of the receiving electrode portion 106, (c) the<br>
positions of the sending electrode portion 105 and the receiving<br>
electrode portion 106 on a human body, and (d) the voltage noise n<br>
of the preamplifier 121 is performed first as preprocessing for<br>
designing (step SPl).<br>
Then, a human body model as well as a sending electrode portion<br>
105 and a receiving electrode portion 106 with the setting parameter<br>
(b) are defined in an electric field simulator; the sending electrode<br>
portion 105 and the receiving electrode portion 106 are arranged at<br>
positions on the human body model corresponding to the setting<br>
parameters (c) on the human body; and the potential between electrodes<br>
) of the receiving electrode portion 106, shown when excitation<br>
is caused between the electrodes 105a and 105b of the sending electrode<br>
portion 105 by a predetermined applied potential Vs(f) with an<br>
originating frequency f, is determined (step SP2).<br>
After that, the defined terms are substituted with the<br>
corresponding portions of the formula (17) to determine the parameter<br>
depending constant a in the case of designing a transmitter and a<br>
receiver with the setting parameters (b) and (c) (step SP3).<br>
Then, the aperture area K of the receiving electrode portion 106,<br>
the noise index NF and the limit position rneighbor in the communication<br>
range with the sending electrode portion 105 as the center thereof<br>
are determined, and the determined terms and the setting parameters<br>
(a) are substituted with the corresponding portions of the formula<br>
(24) to determine the maximum product qlmax.<br>
The applied potential Vs (As, ds, fo) to be applied to the sending<br>
electrode portion 105 is determined in the electric simulator such<br>
that the electric field generated from the sending electrode portion<br>
105 with an electrode area As and a distance between electrodes ds<br>
selected as the setting parameters (b) substantially corresponds to<br>
the electric field strength E (Ee) of a composite electric field obtained<br>
as a result of substituting the terms related to the determined maximum<br>
product qlmax into the formula (18) (step SP4).<br>
Then, by substituting the determined applied potential Vs (As,<br>
ds, fo) into the formula (28), such maximum applicable potential AVsmax<br>
(AS, dS, f) that the strength of the induction field at the limit position<br>
rneighbor in the communication range with the sending electrode portion<br>
105 as the center thereof is below the noise floor nf in free space<br>
(step SP5).<br>
Finally, it is confirmed whether or not any applied potential<br>
Vs(f) exists which is below the maximum applicable potential AVSmax<br>
(As, ds, f) and which satisfies that the potential between electrodes<br>
VR(f) of the receiving electrode portion 106 is equal to or above the<br>
voltage noise n of the selected preamplifier 121, as the applied<br>
potential Vs(f) to be supplied to the sending electrode portion 105<br>
(step SP6).<br>
If there is no such applied potential Vs(f) as satisfies the<br>
conditions, all or a part of the setting parameters (a) to (d) are<br>
reviewed again, and the procedure from the steps SP2 to SP 6 are repeated<br>
based on the reviewed and changed setting parameters.<br>
On the contrary, if an applied potential Vs(f) that satisfies<br>
the conditions exists, it means that the designing of a transmitter<br>
and a receiver was successful. The setting procedure then ends.<br>
By performing the designing procedure RT shown in Figure 31 as<br>
described above, the applied potent ial Vs(f) to be applied to the sending<br>
electrode portion 105 according to arbitrarily selected setting<br>
parameters can be determined such that the strength of the induction<br>
field component within a predetermined range of an electric field<br>
generated from an electric field source is below a noise floor level.<br>
When it is assumed that transmitters and receivers may be attached<br>
at multiple positions, it is possible to determine the application<br>
potential Vs(f) to be applied according to the setting parameters for<br>
each of the transmitters and receivers at the positions by sequentially<br>
performing the procedure from the steps SP1 to SP6 for all the positions.<br>
(3-5) Operation and effects<br>
In the above configuration, in the communication system 100, the<br>
sending electrode portion 105 is formed in a structure according to<br>
rthe reference frequency such that the strength of the induction field<br>
component of an electric field is below the noise floor specified<br>
according to the communication band.<br>
Accordingly, in the communication system 100,<br>
energy required for communication is reduced by reduction of the<br>
induction field and radiation field components unnecessary for<br>
quasi-electrostatic field communication, and spatial resolution can<br>
be enhanced due to prevention of unnecessary propagation. Thus,<br>
stabilization of communication can be enhanced.<br>
In addition, in the communication system 100, stabilization of<br>
communication can be enhanced more by limiting the voltage to be applied<br>
between sending electrodes according to the reference frequency.<br>
According to the above configuration, the sending electrode<br>
portion 105 is formed in a structure according to the reference frequency<br>
such that the strength of the induction field component of an electric<br>
field is to be below the noise floor specified according to the<br>
communication band. Accordingly, energy required for communication<br>
is reduced by reduction of the induction field and radiation field<br>
components unnecessary for quasi-electrostatic field communication,<br>
and spatial resolution can be enhanced due to prevention of unnecessary<br>
propagation. Thus, stabilization of communication can be enhanced<br>
and the degree of freedom in communication can be enhanced.<br>
(3-6) Other embodiments<br>
In the second embodiment described above, description has been<br>
made on the case where an electric structure according to the reference<br>
frequency is selected based on the formula (16) such that the strength<br>
of the induction field component of an electric field is to be below<br>
the noise floor specified according to the communication <br>

may be selected based on any formula other than the formula (16), such<br>
as a formula improved based on the formula (16).<br>
Furthermore, in the second embodiment described above,<br>
description has been made on the case where a potential corresponding<br>
to a prespecified originating frequency (working frequency) is set<br>
and a signal with the set potential is generated and applied, as<br>
generation means for generating a signal to be applied to an electrode<br>
with the electrode structure according to the used frequency. The<br>
present invention, however, is not limited thereto, and it is also<br>
possible to hold multiple frequencies and potentials corresponding<br>
to frequencies in a table, refer to the table to determine a potential<br>
corresponding to the frequency to be used, and sequentially generate<br>
signals with the determined potential by switching them at a<br>
predetermined timing to apply them.<br>
In this case, since communication can be performed with the<br>
headphone device 103 using multiple frequencies, it is possible to<br>
enhance communication efficiency while maintaining stabilization of<br>
communication.<br>
Furthermore, in the second embodiment described above,<br>
description has been made, as for the positions of a transmitter and<br>
a receiver, on the case where the voice reproducer 102 is positioned<br>
at a hip pocket of clothes over a human body and the headphone device<br>
103 is positioned at the head top of the human body. The present<br>
invention, however, is not limited thereto, and the transmitter and<br>
the receiver (the voice reproducer 102 and the headphone device 103)<br>
may be arranged at various other positions.<br>
Furthermore, as for combination of a transmitter and a receiver,<br>
various other combinations of a transmitter and a receiver may be applied,<br>
including the case of communication between a mobile telephone and<br>
a personal computer. In this case, a set of a sending electrode portion<br>
105 and a receiving electrode portion 106 is mounted on both of the<br>
transmitter and the receiver.<br>
Furthermore, in this case, information to be sent and received<br>
may be information other than voice; the number of human bodies via<br>
which the information passes may be any number, and organisms such<br>
as mammals, reptiles, plants, even a predetermined conductive material<br>
and various other targets may be applied instead of a human body.<br>
Industrial Applicability<br>
The present invention can be applied to the case where near field<br>
communication is performed utilizing potential difference between<br>
electrodes of a transmitter and a receiver, and particularly to the<br>
case where information is sent and received via a human body.<br>
