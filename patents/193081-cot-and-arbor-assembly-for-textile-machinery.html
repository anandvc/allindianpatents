				<td>This  invention relates to Cot and Arbor  assenbly for textile nachinery.<br>
In the manufacture of yarn by ring spinning, roving to be converted into yarn is drafted between cots and aprons. Cots are mounted to press hard against the aprons and the roving gets drafted while being passed therethrough. The drafted roving Is then subjected to further processing like twisting and winding. Under ideal conditions, the entire drafted material processed by the cots and aprons is delivered to the next stage of spinning process. However, conditions are not always ideal, and the drafted material develops an affinity to the cot surface atmospheric ' conditions like humidity and temperature, surface conditions like humidity and temperature, surface conditions of the cots and development of static electric charges on the surface of the cots would cause at least a portion of the drafted fibre to cling to the surface of the cot. A fibery film gets deposited on the cot surface and continuous operation of the machinery, increases the density of the deposit on the cot surface. Naturally, at least a portion of this fibery deposit on the cot tend to migrate to the side of the cot in course of time.<br>
Cots are rotatably mounted on shafts or arbors with the help of bearings. The outer surface of the bearings on which cots  are mounted to the arbor is sealed or protected.   However,<br><br>
in order to facilitate periodic lubrication of the bearings,  the inner bearing surface is unprotected or not sealed.<br>
During continuous spinning operations, cots get thick fibery coatings which migrate towards the side of the cot. A portion of this accunulated nass gets sucked in by the dust extractor. He have observed that considerable mass of this deposit enters the bearing housing and gets entangled therewith. As the quantun of migrated fibers increases, the bearings acquire a beard of fibres. As the friction increases the bearing and the cot stop functioning, resulting in imperfect and undesirable spinning of yarn.<br>
Thus, the need to limit the flow of fibres from the cot to the bearing house has been felt, to enable continuous spinning process and to produce yarn of uniform and superior quality. The objective of this invention is to develop a cot and arbor assembly for textile machinery with means for limiting and reducing the migration of fibre from the cot to the bearing house.<br>
We have observed that a protective shield or cover provided over the bearing house coaxially with the 'arbor prevents or reduces fibre movement considerably. This protective shield is<br><br>
In the shape of a truncated cone, fixed around the bearing housing. The nouth of the cone is located away fron the cot. Such that in a cot and arbor assenbly consisting of two cots nounted on an arbor, the mouths of the protective neans face each other and the narrow ends of the cones are attached to the side walls of the cots over the bearing house. The truncated cone or shield nay be made of any suitable materials like metals, plastics and polymers and may be fixed to the assembly by any known means such as by machining, with the help of screws or with adhesives.<br>
During continuous spinning operations, fibre deposits on cots move to the sides thereof but are blocked by the protective shield. This prevents entry of waste fibre into the bearing housing and allows continuous and smooth operation. As the operation of the spinning machine continues, deposited fibres on the cot move to the sides and form loops around the tapered ends of the truncated cone shaped protective means. These loops may be periodically removed without interrupting the spinning process.<br>
The conical shield provides a platform for accumulated fibre waste. The conical shape also accomodates the dust extract for mechanical removal of accumulated fibre waste.<br><br>
The cot and arbor asseubly for textile machines according to this invention comprises at least one cot rotatably nounted on an arbor, and at least one truncated cone shaped protective neans coaxially disposed on the arbor, the tapered end of the said conical protecting neans aligning with the side wall of the said cot and the nouth facing away therefrom, the said conical protective neans located around the bearings on which the said cot is rotatably mounted.<br>
The present invention will now be described with reference to. the two figures in the iiccompanying drawings.<br>
Figure I depicts the cot and arbor assembly hitherto known in the art i.e. without the conical protective shield. Reference numerals 1 and 2 show cots mounted rotatably on arbor 3. 4 and 5 represent the bearings on which the cots rotate. 6 and 7 represent the outer ends of the bearings whi^h are covered while the bearing ends 4 and 5 are left exposed for periodic lubrication and cleaning. During spinning process fine fibre gets deposited on the cot due to factors already mentioned and on accumulation they migrate to the sides of the cot. Since the ends 4 and 5 of the bearing are unprotected or exposed, the migrating filaments get entangled therein affecting the smooth functioning of  the  spinning machine.   Increased  friction  caused  by the<br><br>
fibre  residue  deposits affects the smooth  functioning  of  the nachinery.<br>
Fig II highlights the details of the present invention. Known and conventional parts of the assenbly are represented by the reference nunerals according to the above description relating to fig I. Reference nunerals 8 and 9 indicate the truncated cone shaped protective shield around the inner and exposed bearings. Fibers that nigrate to the inner side of the arbor are trapped by the shield. Often they form loops around the shield and can be relieved sufficiently early before they get entangled with the bearing. The angle between the bearing and the truncated cone is not critical. In one experinent, we found that when angle 0 is 30°, the bearing choke is reduced to zero.<br>
The invention is not United to the specific enbodinent described and illustrated herein above and nay be altered or nodified in nany ways by those skilled in the art without underlying fron the inventive concept described and clained in the appended clains.<br><br><br>
!• Cot and arbor assembly for textile machines comprising at least one cot rotatably nounted on an arbor and at least one truncated cone shaped protective means coaxially disposed on the arbor, the tapered end of the said conical protective means aligning with the side wall of the said cot and the nouth facing away therefron, the said conical protective neans located around the bearings on which the said cot is rotatably mounted.<br>
2.	The cot and arbor assenbly as clained in claim 1,<br>
wherein at least two cots are rotatably mounted on an arbor, each<br>
cot having a cone shaped protective neans, the tapered end<br>
thereof aligning with inner side wall of the said cot and their<br>
mouths facing each other.<br>
3.	The cot and arbor assenbly as clained in clains 1 and 2 wherein the angle between the peripheries of the bearing and the protective neans is 30°.<br>
4.	The cot and arbor assenbly as clained in clains 1 to 3 wherein the conical protective neans is nade fron netals, plastics and/or polyners.<br><br>
B. the cot and arbor assembly as clained in claim 4 wherein the said protective means is fixed to the assembly by machining or with adhesives.<br>
8.	Cot   and  arbor  assembly   for   textile  nachines<br>
