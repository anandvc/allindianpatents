This application and all applications and prior publications cither therein (including documents cited in the text or during prosecution) and all documents cited herein ("appln cited documents") and all documents cited or referenced in appln cited documents are hereby expressly incorporated by reference.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention provides for, inter alia, novel topical formulations comprising at least one 1-N-arylpyrazole derivatives and at least one formamidine such as amitraz and to methods for treating parasite infestations in mammals and birds by topically applying the inventive formulations to said mammals and birds. The inventive formulations exhibit activity against ectoparasites such as fleas and ticks, that is far superior than formulations comprising an 1-N-arypyrazole derivative alone, such as fipronil, thereby indicating synergy. This result is even more surprising given the fact that amitraz is not recognized in the field as a flea product.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Parasitic diseases may be caused by either endoparasites or ectoparasites. As used<br>
herein endoparasites refer to those parasites living inside the body of the host, either within an organ (such as the stomach, lungs, heart, intestines, etc.) or simply under the skin. Ectoparasites are those parasites that live on the outer surface of the host but still draw nutrients from the host. Endoparasitic diseases may further be subdivided based on class of parasite involved in the infection. For example, endoparasitic diseases generally referred to<br><br>
as helminthiasis are due to infection of the host with parasitic worms known as helminths. Helminthiasis is a prevalent and serious worldwide economic problem involving infection of domesticated animals such as swine, sheep, horses, cattle, goats, dogs, cats, and poultry. Many of these infections, caused by the group of worms described as nematodes, cause diseases in various species of animals throughout the world. These diseases are frequently serious and can result in the death of the infected animal. The most common genera of nematodes infecting the animals referred to above include, but are not limited to, Haemonchus, Trichostrongylus, Ostertagia, Nematodirus, Cooperia, Ascaris, Bunostomum, Oesophagostomum, Chabertia, Trichuris, Strongylus, Trichonema, Dictyocaulus, Capillaria, Heterakis, Toxocara, Ascaridia, Oxyuris, Ancylostoma, Uncinaria, Toxascaris, and Parascaris. Many parasites are species specific (infect only one host) and most also have a preferred site of infection within the animal. Thus, Haemonchus and Ostertagia primarily infect the stomach while Nematodirus and Cooperia mostly attack the intestines. Other endoparasites reside in the heart, eyes, lungs, blood vessels, and the like while still others are subcutaneous parasites. Helminthiasis can lead to weakness, weight loss, anemia, intestinal damage, malnutrition, and damage to other organs. If left untreated these diseases can result in the death of the animal.<br>
Examples of endoparasites which infect animals and man include but are not limited to gastro-intestinal parasites of the genera Ancylostoma, Necator, Ascaris, Strongyloides, Trichinella, Capillaria, Trichuris, Enterobius, and the like. Other endoparasites which intect animals and man are found in the blood or in other organs. Examples of such parasites include but are not limited to filarial worms Wuchereria, Brugia, Onchocerca, and the like as well as extra-intestinal stages of the intestinal worms Strongylides and Trichinella. Ectoparasites which infest man and domestic animals include arthropods, such as ticks, fleas.<br><br>
mites, mosquitos, lice, and the like and infections by these parasites can result in transmission of serious and even fatal diseases.<br>
Infestations by ectoparasitic arthropods including but not limited to ticks, mites, lice, stable flies, hornflies, blowflies, face fies, fleas, mosquitoes and the like are also a serious problem. Infection by these parasites results not only in loss of blood and skin lesions, but also can interfere with normal eating habits thus causing weight loss. Ectoparasitic infestations of a host can also result in transmission of serious diseases including but not limited to encephalitis, anaplasmosis, babesiosis, rocky mountain spotted fever, Lyme disease, ehrlichiosis, West Nile virus, swine pox, malaria, yellow fever, and the like, many of which can be fatal to the host. Animals may be infected by several species of parasite at the same time since infection by one parasite may weaken the animal and make it more susceptible to infection by a second species of parasite.<br>
Many of the compounds used in this invention are also active against household pests including but not limited to cockroach, Blatella sp., clothes moth, Tineola sp., carpet beetle, Allagenus sp. and the housefly Musca clomeslica and against Solenopsis invicta (imported fire ants), termites, and the like.<br>
These compounds are furthermore useful against agricultural pests such as aphids (Acyrthiosiphon sp.) locusts, and boll weevils as well as against insect pest which attack stored grains such as Tribolium sp. and against immature stages of insects living on plant tissue. Anthelmintic compounds are also useful as a nematodicide for the control of soil nematodes, which may be agriculturally important.<br>
Antiparasitic agents are also useful for the treatment and/or prevention of helminthiasis in domestic animals such as cattle, sheep, horses, dogs, cats, goats, swine, and poultry. They are also useful in the prevention and treatment of parasitic infections of these<br><br>
animals by ectoparasites such as ticks, mites, lice, fleas, mosquitoes and the like. They are also effective in the treatment of parasitic infections of humans.<br>
Various methods of formulating antiparasitical formulations are known in the art. These include oral formulations, baits, dietary supplements, powders, shampoos, etc. Formulations for localized topical applications of antiparasitical formulations are also known in the art. For example, pour-on solutions comprising 1-N-phenylpyrazole derivatives, such as fipronil, are known in the art and are described in, for example. U.S. Patent 6,010,710, U.S. Patent 6,413,542, U.S. Patent No. 6,001,384, U.S. Patent 6,413,542 as well as copending application 10/120,691, filed April 11, 2002 and now allowed. Other methods of formulating antiparasitic agents include spot-on formulations or spays.<br>
Spot-on formulations are well known techniques for topically delivering an antiparasitic agent to a limited area of the host. For example, U.S. Patent 5,045,536 describes such formulations for ectoparasites. Other spot-on formulations include U.S. Patent 6,426,333 and U.S. Patent 6,482,425 and application USSN 10/155,397, now allowed and published as Publication No. U.S. 2003-0050327A1. Reference is also made to Publication No. U.S. 2003-166688A1. WO 01/957715 describes a method for controlling ectoparasites in small rodents as well as interrupting or preventing the diseases caused by arthropods or small rodents, which comprise applying topical formulations, such as spot-on compositions, to the skin, or hair of the rodents.<br>
l-N-arylpyrazoles as a class of chemicals are well known in the art, as well as methods for their use in controlling parasites including insects, such as fleas, ticks, lice or mosquitoes in mammals, such as domesticated livestock or companion animals or birds, either alone or in combination with other pesticides such as insect growth regulators. See, e.g.. EP-A-295,217, EP 295 177, EP-A-840-686, EP-A-352,944, WO 00/35844, WO 98/39972. U.S. Patent Nos. 5,122.530 5,236,938, 5,232,940, 5,576,429 5,814,652,<br><br>
5,567.429. 6,090,751 and 6,096,329 as \\ell as Publication No. US 2002-90381-A I. Sec also copending applications USSN 07/719,942; 08/933,016; 09/174,598; 08/863,182; and 08/863,692. The compounds of the families defined in these patents are extremely active and one of these compounds, 5-amino-3-cyano-l-(2,6-dichloro-4-tritluoromethylphenyl)-4-trifluoromethylsulfinylpyrazole, or fipronil, is particularly effective, but not exclusively effective, against fleas and ticks. The I -arylpyrazoles exert their activity by being distributed through the sebaceous glands of the animal.<br>
WO-A-87/3781, EP-A-295,117 and EP-A-500,209 describe a class of insecticides which are N-phenyl-pyrazole derivatives. These compounds are given as having activity against a very large number of parasites, including insects and acarines in fields as varied as agriculture, public health and veterinary medicine. The general teaching of these documents indicates that these insecticidal compounds may be administered via different routes: oral, parenteral, percutaneous and topical routes. Topical administration comprises, in particular, skin solutions (pour-on or spot-on), sprays, drenches, baths, showers, jets, powders, greases, shampoos, creams, etc. The pour-on type skin solutions may be designed for percutaneous administration. Example 9 of EP-A-295.117 and Example 291 of EP-A-500,209 describe a pour-on type skin solution containing 15% insecticide and 85% dimethyl sulphoxide, for percutaneous administration of the insecticide. 1-N-arylpyrazole derivatives are known in the art to prevent, treat or control ectoparasite infestation in mammals, such as cats, dogs and cattle.<br>
Amitraz is known in the art as a pesticide and is used to control red spider mites, leaf mites, scale insects and aphids. In animals, amitraz is used to control tick, mites, and lice. Extoxnet http://ace.orst.edu/info/extonet/pips/amitraz.html. However, amitraz is not known in the art to treat fleas Amitraz belongs to the formamidine chemical group, a group including chlordimeform and chlormebuform, both of which are useful in crop protection. Amitraz.<br><br>
described in U.S. Patent Nos. 3.781.355 and 3,864,497 (the contents of which are hereby incorporated     by     reference     in     their     entireties)     has     the     following     structure. <br><br>
(Figure Removed)Other compounds that are known in the art to present, treat or control endo- and ectoparasite infestation include milbemycin or avermectin derivatives. The avermectin and milbemycin series of compounds are potent anthelmintic and antiparasitic agents against a wide range of internal and external parasites. The compounds which belong to this series are either natural products or are semi-synthetic derivatives thereof. The structures of these two series of compounds are closely related and they both share a complex 16-membered macrocyclic lactone ring; however, the milbemycin do not contain the aglycone substituent in the 13-position of the lactone ring. The natural product avermectins are disclosed in U.S. Patent 4.310,519 to Albers-Schonberg, et al., and the 22, 23-dihydro avermectin compounds are disclosed in Chabala, et al., U.S. Patent 4,199,569. For a general discussion of avermectins, which include a discussion of their uses in humans and animals, see "Ivermectin and Abamectin," W.C. Campbell, ed.. Springer-Verlag, New York (1989). Naturally occurring milbemycins are described in Aoki et al., U.S. Patent 3,950,360 as well as in the various references cited in "The Merck Index" 12th ed., S. Budavari. Ed.. Merck &amp; Co., Inc.Whitehouse Station. New Jersey (1996). Semisynthetic derivatives of these classes of compounds are well known in the an and are described, for example, in U.S. Patent 5.077,308. U.S. Patent 4,859,657. U.S. Patent 4,963,582, U.S. Patent 4.855,317, U.S. Patent 4.871.719. U.S. Patent 4,874,749, U.S. Patent 4.427,663, U.S. Patent 4.310,519, U.S. Patent 4.199,569.

As discussed above, amitraz is well known in the art and can be obtained from commercial source. Amitraz belongs lo a chemical group known as the formamidines. Thus, the invention comprehends the use in inventive compositions and methods of at least one formamidine, such as amitraz . h'ormamidines are insecticides having the structure -N=CH-N. such as amitraz, chlordiinetbrm, chlormebuform, formetanate, and l-dimethyl-2-(2'-methyl-4'-chlorophenyl)-formamidine (Chlorphenamidin) that, without wishing to necessarily be bound by any one particular theory, are useful as insecticides by inhibiting monoamine oxidase and/or interfering with an insect's nervous system (eg voltage sensitive gates in nerve membranes) and are especially useful against all stages of mites and ticks. Amounts for application to animals of these insecticides can be determined from known uses of these insecticides, without undue experimentation, (eg, MITABAN is a commercially available amitraz product approved for cattle, swine, and dogs, in the US, typically used as a collar tor dogs, but also available in liquid forms such as a liquid concentrate; amitraz has an oral LD50 in rats of 800 mg/kg, a dermal LD50 in rabbits of &gt;200 mg/kg: when applied to skin of dog in 0.025% solution amitraz produces transient sedation, depression of rectal temperature and increases blood glucose, and amitraz is well tolerated when fed at 0.25 mg/kg/d x 90 days, with, at doses of 1-4 mg/kg hyperglycemia consistently observed, but sedation being the most frequent untoward effect). Accordingly, in inventive compositions and methods, a formamidine, advantageously amitraz, can be emplo)ed, i.e., amitraz is exemplar) of a formamidine that can be used in the invention.<br>
Parasiticidal compounds useful in the present invention also include those with an ovicidal and/or larvicidal effect on the immature stages of various ectoparasites. Man)1 of<br>
these are already known, for example from patent U.S. Pat. No. 5.439.924. Among these compounds are featured insect growth regulator compounds (1GR) which act either by blocking the development of the immature stages (eggs and larvae) into adult stages, or by inhibiting the synthesis of chitin. Patent FR-A-2,713.889 is moreover known, \\hich generally describes the combination of at least one compound of IGR (insect growth regulator) type, comprising compounds \\ithjuvenile hormone activity and chitin synthesis inhibitors, with at least one of three N-aryldiazole compounds, in particular fipronil, to control many harmful insects belonging to very varied orders. See also US Patents Nos. 6.797,724, 6,685,954, 6,413,542, 6,096,329, each of which, together with each document cited in and on each of these patents, is hereby incorporated herein by reference, as IGRs therein and formulations therein, additionally containing one or more Ibrmamidine such as amitraz or chlordimeform may be used in the practice of this invention.<br>
IGR compounds are another class of insecticides or acaricides, which are provided for in the bait formulations in this invention. Compounds belonging to this group are well known to the practitioner and represent a wide range-of different chemical classes. These compounds all act by interfering with the development or growth of the insect pests. Compounds with an ovicidal and/or larvicidal effect on the immature stages of various ectoparasites are already known, for example from U.S. Patent No. 5,439,924. Among these compounds described are those IGR compounds which act either by blocking the development of the immature stages (eggs and larvae) into adult stages, or by inhibiting the synthesis of chitin. Insect growth regulators are described, for example, in U.S. Patent 3.748.356; U.S. Patent 3,818,047: U.S. Patent 4,225.598; U.S. Patent 4.798,837; and U.S. Patent 4.751.225, as well as in HP 179,022 or U.K. 2.140,010. French Patent No. A-2.713,889 generally describes an IGR combination comprising at least one compound with juvenile hormone activity and chilin synthesis inhibitors, with at least one of three N-<br>
urylpyrazole compounds, in particular fipronil. to control many harmful insects belonging to \LT_V varied orders.<br>

Preferred IGR compounds include methoprenes, pyriproxyfens, hydroprene, cyromazine, lufenuron, l-(2,6-difluorobenzoyl)-3-(2-fluoro-4-(trifluoromethyl)phenylurea and novaluron.<br>
Other class compounds which maybe combined with the inventive ectoparasitical combination include avermectin and milbemycin derivatives, pyrethroids, benzamidazoles and imidazoles. Preferred avermectins or milbemycins include doramectin, enamectin, abamectin, eprinomectin, ivermectin, selamectin, moxidectin and milbemycin oxime. Preferred pyrethroids include the pyrethrins, permethrin, resmethrin and sumithrin. Preferred benzimidazoles include albendazole, fenbenazole, mebendazole. oxibendazole and triclabendazole. A preferred imidazoleothiazole is levamisole. The amount of these compounds to be included with the inventive ectoparasitical combination depends on the type of animal and the degree of infestation. The amounts of these compounds are easily determined by one skilled in the an. Representative amounts include O.OOlmg/kg to lOOmg/kg, with the avermectins having preferred range of 0.001 mg/kg to lOmg/kg and the other classes from 0.1 mg/kg to 100 mg/kg.<br>
Administration of the inventive formulation may be intermittent in time and may be administered daily, weekly, biweekly, monthly, bimonthly, quarterly, or even for longer<br>
durations of time. The time period between treatments depends upon factors such as the parasite(s) being treated, the degree of infestation, the type of animal, mammal or bird, and the environment where it resides. It is well within the skill level of the practitioner to determine a specific administration period for a particular situation. This invention contemplates a method for permanently combating a parasite in an environment in which the animal is subjected to strong parasitic pressure where the administration is at a frequency far below a daily administration in this case. For example, it is preferable for the treatment according to the invention to be carried out monthly on mammals, such as on dogs and on cats.<br>
Spot-on formulations may be prepared by dissolving the active ingredients into the pharmaceutically or veterinary acceptable vehicle. Alternatively, the spot-on formulation can be prepared by encapsulation of the active ingredient to leave a residue of the therapeutic agent on the surface of the animal. These formulations will vary with regard to the weight of the therapeutic agent in the combination depending on the species of host animal to be treated, the severity and type of infection and the body weight of the host. The compounds may be administered continuously, particularly for prophylaxis, by known methods. Generally, a dose of from about 0.001 to about 10 mg per kg of body weight given as a single dose or in divided doses for a period of from 1 to 5 days will be satisfactory but, of course, there can be instance where higher or lower dosage ranges are indicated and such are within the scope of this specific administration period for a particular situation. This invention contemplates a method for combating mosquitoes in an environment in which the animal is subjected to strong mosquito pressure where the administration is at a frequency far below a daily administration in this case. For example, it is preferable for the treatment according to the invention to be carried out monthly on dogs and on cats and or birds.<br>
Spot-on and pour-on formulations may be prepared by dissolving the active ingredients into the pharmaceutically or veterinary acceptable vehicle. Alternatively, the spot-on formulation can be prepared by encapsulation of the active ingredient to leave a residue of the therapeutic agent on the surface of the animal. These formulations will vary \\ith regard to the weight of the therapeutic agent in the combination depending on the species of host animal to be treated, the severity and type of infection and the body weight of the host. The compounds may be administered continuously, particularly for prophylaxis, by known methods. Generally, a dose of from about 0.001 to about 100 ing per kg of body weight of l-N-arylpyrazole and 0.01 to about 100 mg/kg of amitraz given as a single dose or in divided doses for a period of from 1 to 5 days will be satisfactory but, of course, there can be instance where higher or lower dosage ranges are indicated and such are within the scope of this invention. It is well within the routine skill of the practitioner to determine a particular dosing regimen for a specific host and parasite.<br>
Preferably, a single formulation containing the l-N-arylpyrazole derivative is in a substantially liquid carrier and is in a form which makes possible a single application or an application repeated a small number of times. The formulation will be administered to the animal over a highly localized region of the animal, preferably between the two shoulders. It is well within the routine skill of the practitioner to determine a particular dosing regimen for a specific host and parasite. Most preferably, this localized region has a surface area of less than 10 cm2, especially between 5 and 10 cm2 area. Remarkably, it has been discovered that such a formulation is highly effective against both the targeted parasites.<br>
The treatment is preferably carried out so as to administer to the host, on a single occasion, a dose containing between about 0.001 and about 100 mg/kg of a compound of formula (11).<br>
The amount of compounds of l-N-aylpyrazole for animals which are small in size is preferably greater than about 0.01 mg and in a particularly preferred way between about 1 and about 50 mg/kg of weight of animal.<br>
It also may be preferable to use controlled-release formulations.<br>
This invention also provides for a method for cleaning the coats and the skin of animals by removal of the parasites which are present and of their waste and excreta. The animals treated thus exhibit a coat which is more pleasing to the eye and more pleasant to the touch.<br>
The invention also relates to such a method with a therapeutic aim intended for the treatment and prevention of parasitoses having pathogenic consequences.<br>
In another preferred embodiment this provides for a composition for combating fleas in small mammals, in particular dogs and cats, characterized in that it contains at least one of formula (II) as defined above.<br>
The formulations of the present invention provide for the topical administration of a concentrated solution, suspension, microemulsion or emulsion for intermittent application to a spot on the animal, generally between the two shoulders (solution of spot-on type). It has been discovered that the inventive formulations are especially active against parasites when the formulations are applied to animals, such as mammals, especially dogs, cats, sheep, pigs, cattle and horses and birds, especially chickens, turkeys and quails. The ectoparasitical combination can advantageously be present in this formulation in a proportion of about 1 to about 20%, preferably of about 5 to about 15% (percentages as weight by volume = W/V). The liquid carrier vehicle comprises a pharmaceutically or veterinary acceptable organic solvent and optionally an organic cosolvent.<br>
Also contemplated are the phannaceutically or veterinary acceptable acid or base salts, where applicable, of the active compounds provided for herein. The term "acid"<br>
contemplates all pharmaceutical!) or veterinary acceptable inorganic or organic acids. Inorganic acids include mineral acids such as hydrohalic acids, such as hydrobromic and hydrochloric acids, sulfuric acids, phosphoric acids and nitric acids. Organic acids include all pharmaceutically or veterinary acceptable aliphatic, alicyclic and aromatic carboxylic acids, dicarboxylic acids tricarboxylic acids and fatty acids. Preferred acids are straight chain or branched, saturated or unsaturated C|-C':n aliphatic carboxylic acids, which are optionally substituted by halogen or by hydroxvl groups, or C6-C|? aromatic carboxylic acids. Examples of such acids are carbonic acid, formic acid, fumaric acid, acetic acid, propionic acid, isopropionic acid, valeric acid, a-hydroxy acids, such as glycolic acid and lactic acid, chloroacetic acid, benzoic acid, methane sulfonic acid, and salicylic acid.

Organic bases include the common hydrocarbyl and helerocyclic amine salts, which include, for example, the morpholine and piperidine salts.<br>
The organic solvent for the liquid carrier vehicle will preferably have a dielectric constant of between about 10 and about 35, preferably between about 20 and about 30, the content of this solvent in the overall composition preferably representing the remainder to<br>
100% of the composition. It is well within the skill level of the practitioner to select a suitable solvent on the basis of these parameters.<br>
The organic cosolvent for the liquid carrier vehicle will preferably have a boiling point of less than about 100°C, preferably of less than about 80°C, and will have a dielectric constant of between about 10 and about 40. preferably between about 20 and about 30; this cosolvent can advantageously be present in the composition according to a weight/weight (W/W) ratio with respect to the solvent of between about 1/15 and about 1/2; the cosolvent is volatile in order to act in particular as drying promoter and is miscible with water and/or with the solvent. Again, it is well within the skill level of the practitioner to select a suitable solvent on the basis of these parameters.<br>
The organic solvent for the liquid carrier includes the commonly acceptable organic solvents known in the formulation art. These solvents may be found, for example, in Remington Pharmaceutical Science, I61'1 Edition (1986). These solvents include, for example, acetone, ethyl acetate, methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, dimethylformamide, dichloromethane or diethylene glycol monoethyl ether (Transcutol). These solvents can be supplemented by various excipients according to the nature of the desired phases, such as CV Cio caprylic/capric triglyceride (Estasan or Miglyol 812), oleic acid or propylene glycol.<br>
The liquid carrier may also comprise a microemulsion. Microemulsions are also well suited as the liquid carrier vehicle. Microemulsions are quaternary systems comprising an aqueous phase, an oily phase, a surfactant and a cosurfactant. They are translucent and isotropic liquids.<br>
Microemulsions are composed of stable dispersions of microdroplets of the aqueous phase in the oily phase or conversely of microdroplets of the oily phase in the aqueous phase. The size of these microdroplets is less than 200 nm (1000 to 100,000 nm for emulsions). The interracial film is composed of an alternation of surface-active (SA) and co-surface-active<br>
(C'o-SA) molecules which, by lowering the interfacial tension, allows the microemtilsion to be formed spontaneously.<br>
The oily phase can in particular be formed from mineral or vegetable oils, from unsaturated polyglycosylated glycerides or from triglycerides, or alternatively from mixtures of such compounds. The oily phase preferably comprises triglycerides and more preferably medium-chain triglycerides, for example CVC|0 caprylic/capric triglyceride. The oily phase will represent, in particular, from about 2 to about 15%, more particularly from about 7 to about 10%, preferably from about 8 to about 9%, V/V of the microemulsion.<br>
The aqueous phase includes, for example water or glycol derivatives, such as propylene glycol, glycol ethers, polyethylene glycols or glycerol. Propylene glycol, diethylene glycol monoethyl ether and dipropylene glycol monoethyl ether are especially preferred. Generally, the aqueous phase will represent a proportion from about 1 to about 4% V/V in the microemulsion.<br>
Surfactants for the microemulsion include diethylene glycol monoethyl ether, dipropyelene glycol monomethyl ether, polyglycolysed Cx-Cm glycerides or polyglyceryl-6 dioleate. In addition to these surfactants, the cosurfactants include short-chain alcohols, such as ethanol and propanol.<br>
Some compounds are common to the three components discussed above, i.e., aqueous phase, surfactant and cosurfactant. However, it is well within the skill level of the practitioner to use different compounds for each component of the same formulation.<br>
The cosurfactant to surfactant ratio will preferably be from about 1/7 to about 1/2. There will preferably be from about 25 to about 75% V/V of surfactant and from about 10 to about 55% V/V of cosurfactant in the microemulsion.Likewise, the co-solvents are also well known to a practitioner in the formulation art. Preferred co-solvents are those which is a promoter of drying and include, for example, absolute ethanol. isopropanol (2-propanol) or methanol.<br>
The crystallization inhibitor can in particular be present in a proportion of about I to about 20% (W/V), preferably of about 5 to about 15%. The inhibitor preferably corresponds to the test in which 0.3 ml of a solution comprising 10% (W/V) of the compound of formula (I) in the liquid carrier and 10% of the inhibitor are deposited on a glass slide at 20°C and allowed to stand for 24 hours. The slide is then observed with the naked eye. Acceptable inhibitors are those whose addition provides for few or no crystals, and in particular less than 10 crystals, preferably 0 crystals.<br>
Although this is not preferred, the formulation can optionally comprise water, in particular in a proportion of 0 to about 30% (volume by volume V/V), in particular of 0 to about 5%.<br>
The formulation can also comprise an antioxidizing agent intended to inhibit oxidation in air, this agent being in particular present in a proportion of about 0.005 to about 1% (W/V), preferably of about 0.01 to about 0.05%.<br>

The film-forming agent and the surface-active agent can in particular be incorporated in similar or identical amounts within the limit of the total amounts of crystallization inhibitor mentioned elsewhere.<br>
The pair thus constituted secures, in a noteworthy way, the objectives of absence of crystallization on the coat and of maintenance of the cosmetic appearance of the fur, that is to say without a tendency towards sticking or towards a sticky appearance, despite the high concentration of active material.<br>
Particularly preferred antioxidizing agents are those conventional in the art and include, for example, butylated hydroxyanisole, butylated hydroxytoluene, ascorbic acid, sodium metabisulphite, propyl gallate, sodium thiosulphate or a mixture of not more than two of them.<br>
