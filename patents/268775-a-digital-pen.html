METHOD AND SYSTEM FOR DIGITAL PEN ASSEMBLY<br>
FIELD AND BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to acoustic positioning methods, and more particularly, but not exclusively to a method and an apparatus for data entry using an acoustic signal transmitting pen input device.<br>
Digital writing instruments, interchangeably referred to herein as Digital Pens, regardless of whether they actually write on paper, can be used to capture pen strokes on paper and digitize them.<br>
For example, with a digital pen, pen strokes may be converted by handwriting recognition software to a digitally stored record of the writing. In this way, a laborious, tedious step in modern written communication, namely, the manual transcribing of handwriting into a computerized word processor, is eliminated, greatly increasing productivity.<br>
Sensing a time-dependent position of the pen and converting the positions to pen strokes may be used for input of digital representations of the pen strokes to a handwriting recognition device.<br>
As known in the art, ultrasonic systems can be used in which a special pen generates or alters an ultrasonic signal, as the pen is moved across a piece of paper.<br>
The ultrasonic signal is sensed by receivers and correlated to a position vis-avis each receiver, as the outputs of the receivers is triangulated and correlated to absolute pen positions. A sequence of pen positions can then be digitized for input into handwriting recognition engines.<br><br>
An advantage with ultrasonic systems is that the user of the ultrasonic signal emitting device can use the device to write on an ordinary piece of paper that is placed on or nearby a base station, which receives the ultrasonic signals and converts the signals to alpha-numeric characters.<br>
There are many currently known in the art methods for data entry using an acoustic impulse transmitting pen input device.<br>
US Patent No. 4,814, 552, to Stefik, filed on December 2, 1987, entitled "Ultrasonic position input device", describes an input device, or stylus, for entering hand drawn forms into a computer comprising a writing instrument, a pressure switch for determining whether the instrument is in contact with the writing surface, an acoustic transmitter for triangulating the position of the stylus on the surface, and a wireless transmitter for transmitting data and timing information to the computer.<br>
In operation, the stylus described by Stefik transmits an infrared signal which the system receives immediately, and an ultrasound pulse which two microphones receive after a delay which is a function of the speed of sound and the distance of the stylus from each microphone.<br>
US Patent No. 6,654,008, to Ikeda, filed on November 27, 2001, entitled "Electronic whiteboard and penholder used for the same", describes an electronic whiteboard capable of being drawn, using marker pens of several colors, and one penholder for use in such an electronic whiteboard.<br>
In Ikeda's patent, an infrared light emitting unit emits infrared light containing color information of the marker pen, an ultrasonic wave emitting unit emits the ultrasonic wave, and color information changeover means changes over color information depending on the color of marker pen. The electronic whiteboard main body receives the infrared light and ultrasonic wave emitted from the penholder, and<br><br>
issues information about a position of the penholder depending on the reception timing of the infrared light and ultrasonic wave.<br>
US Patent No. 6,876,356 to Zloter, filed on March 18, 2002, entitled "Digitizer pen", describes a digitizer pen system including a pen having a means protruding from the pen's writing tip, for preventing fingers blocking communication with a base unit,<br>
US Patent No. 6,184,873 to Ward, filed on January 20, 1998, entitled "Pen positioning system", describes a pen positioning system including a pen- The pen has multiple output elements and is adapted to accurately determine the location of the pointing tip of the pen, in relation to an electronic tablet.<br>
The output elements, -preferably ultrasonic transmitters having distinct frequencies, are located a fixed distance from each other, and are also related in space to the pointing tip of the pen.<br>
A detection system is used to receive the output signals from the output elements, isolate the output signals from each other, and process them independently, to determine the location of the output elements and of the pointing tip of the pen.<br>
US Patent No. 6,703, 570 to Russel, filed on May 10, 2000, entitled "Digital pen using ultrasonic tracking ", describes a digital pen system. Russet's system includes an elongated pen defining a writing tip, and an ultrasonic transducer oriented on the pen to direct frames of ultrasonic energy outwardly from the pen, with each frame including plural receive pulses.<br>
The digital pen system in Russel's patent further includes two or more detectors positioned on a base, such as a laptop computer, for receiving the pulses, with each pulse being associated with at least one pulse time of arrival (TO A) relative to at least one detector. Russel's system further includes a processor positioned on the<br><br>
base,   receiving   signals   from   the   detectors,   and   outputting   position   signals representative of positions of the pen, based on the received signals.<br>
However, there are inherent problems in current acoustical technology and in the implementation of the current acoustical technology in digital pens, such as the digital pens described in the patents cited hereinabove.<br>
Among the disadvantages of current acoustic technology are: lack of accuracy, lack of multi-devices support, high power consumption, etc. The problems have implications on the mechanical design of existing data entry using an acoustic impulse transmitting devices.<br>
Apart from that, there are manufacturing problems related to the assembly of the acoustic transmitter and its incorporation in a digital pen or the like. For instance, such problems may arise in connecting an acoustic transmitter to a flexible printed circuit board (PCB). There are also marketing issues, such as differentiation between products by changing their appearance, while keeping the functional parts the same.<br>
There is thus a widely recognized need for, and it would be highly-advantageous to have, an apparatus or a method devoid of the above limitations.<br>

The principles and operation of a digital pen, a digital sleeve, a receiving unit, and a digital pen system according to the present invention may be better understood with reference to the drawings and accompanying description.<br>
The present invention attempts to overcome drawbacks of traditional technologies, some of which are described hereinabove in the background and field of invention section. The present invention attempts to improve current technologies by introducing and implementing new ideas into the design of a viable product, be it a digital pen, a digital sleeve, a receiver for. acoustic signals transmitted from a digital pen, or a digital pen system.<br>
Before explaining at least one embodiment of the invention in detail, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited in its application to the details of construction and the arrangement of the components set forth in the following description or illustrated in the drawings. The invention is capable of other embodiments or of being practiced or carried out in various ways. Also, it is to be understood that the phraseology and terminology employed herein is for the purpose of description and should not be regarded as limiting.<br><br>
Reference is now made to Fig, 1, which is a simplified block diagram illustrating a digital pen, according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention.<br>
A digital pen 1000, according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention includes at least one acoustic transmitter 100, preferably deployed adjacent to the pen's tip, and an electric circuit 110 such as a flexible printed electric circuit board (PCB) 120 which includes a connection to an electric power source, such as a miniature battery.<br>
Preferably, the acoustic transmitter 100 is an ultrasound transducer.<br>
Optionally, the ultrasound transducer is a piezoelectric transducer which converts electrical energy into ultrasound signals. Piezoelectric crystals have the property of changing size when an electric voltage is applied to them. By applying an alternating electric voltage (AC) on a piezoelectric crystal, the crystal is caused to oscillate at very high frequencies producing ultrasound signals comprised of very high frequency sound waves.<br>
Preferably, the ultrasound transducer is made of Polyvinylidene Fluoride (PVDF), which is flexible plastic polymer, bearing piezoelectric properties.<br>
The acoustic transmitter 100 is electrically connected to the circuit 110, which may be detached from the transmitter 110, say to allow assembling an ink refill inside in the pen.<br>
However, the acoustic transmitter 100 is too sensitive to allow heating for soldering, for electrically connecting the transmitter 100 to the electric circuit 110, or even the attachment of plastic to the transmitter 100. Though screwing the transmitter is optional, it is not suitable for fast high volume production.<br><br>
A preferred embodiment of the present invention attempts to overcome the difficulty in electrically connecting the transmitter 100 and the electric circuit 110, using a resilient holder 120,<br>
The resilient holder 120 presses the electric circuit 110 into contact with the acoustic transmitter 100, upon applying a mechanical pressure on the resilient holder 120, so as to electrically connect the electric circuit 110 and the acoustic transmitter 100.<br>
Optionally, the resilient holder 120 is further configured to push the flexible PCB into a position, in order to allow the placement of components such as IR transmitters in certain positions.<br>
Preferably, the resilient holder 120 facilitates the digital pen's 1000 being smaller than known in the art digital pens.<br>
Reference is now made to Fig. 2a which is an exemplary depiction of a resilient holder deployed inside a digital pen, according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention.<br>
A digital pen 2000 according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention has an elongated body terminating in a writing tip, a writing element 220 protruding from the writing tip, an acoustic transmitter 210 deployed adjacent to the writing tip, and an electric circuit 240 such as a flexible PCB 240 (flexible printed circuit board) or conductors.<br>
The digital pen's writing element may be, but is not limited to an ink refill, a pencil tip, a marker, etc. The digital pen may also include an eraser. The digital pen may also allow a user to change the color of writing, say using the switch assembly, described in detail herein below. Optionally, the writing element is rather a sharpened<br>
5     tip which does not physically write.<br>
*<br><br>
Preferably, the digital pen 2000 further includes a resilient holder 250 pressing the flex PCB 240 (or the conductors) into contact with the acoustic transmitter 210, for electrically connecting the flex PCB 240 and the acoustic transmitter 210 (and to the pen body).<br>
Preferably, the resilient holder 250 may be made of conductive material, in order to increase electrical conductivity between the Flex PCB 240 and the acoustic transmitter 210.<br>
Optionally, the electric conductivity between the Flex PCB 240 and the acoustic transmitter 210 may be increased by deploying gold contacts on the resilient holder 250.<br>
The resilient holder 250 secures electrical contact between the Flex PCB 240 and the acoustic transmitter 210. Optionally, as a result of mechanical pressure applied on the resilient holder 250, say from the pen's housing.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the resilient holder 250 is in the shape of a "U": solid above and open below, such that the pen body is kept tight by the bottom part of the resilient holder 250. The "U" shaped resilient holder 250 comprises a base and extensions arising perpendicularly from the base, and is configured-for location of the flex PCB 240 or any other first electric circuit, and a second electric circuit, within the confines of a housing. The resilient holder 250 brings about an electric contact between the two electric circuit, due the confinement within the housing, thereby connecting the two circuits. By connecting the two circuits, the resilient holder 250 electrically connects the flexible PCB 240 and the acoustic transmitter 210.<br>
Preferably, the resilient holder 250 has some elasticity so as to enable easy assembly, by putting all parts and sliding the resilient holder 250 to position. The mechanical force is kept by elastic lugs on the upper part consisting of the base<br><br>
hereinabove. The elastic lugs push the holder up (while the bottom part is secured to the pen's body as explained hereinabove), as explained hereinabove.<br>
Reference is now made to Fig. 2b which shows an exemplary a digital pen having a resilient holder, according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention.<br>
A digital pen 2000 has a resilient holder 290, as described hereinabove. The resilient holder 290 further has leaf springs 292. The leaf springs 292 are configured to apply pressure on an acoustic transmitter's ribbon, thereby connecting the acoustic transmitter to the flexible PCB 295, as described hereinabove.<br>
Reference is now made to Fig. 3 which an exemplary depiction of a digital pen having a switch assembly comprising two switches, according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention.<br>
A digital pen 3000, according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention includes at least one acoustic transmitter 310, preferably an ultrasound transducer.<br>
The digital pen 3000 further comprises a switch assembly 320 having at least two switches. The digital pen 3000 has a certain mode which a user may select by pressing at least two of the switches substantially simultaneously.<br>
Optionally, the switch assembly 320 is mechanically designed, according to known in the art techniques, with a position associated with the certain mode of the pen. Preferably, the position is accessible only when the user presses the two switches of the switch assembly 320 simultaneously, or almost simultaneously.<br>
Reference is now made to Fig. 4a, which is a block diagram schematically illustrating an exemplary switch assembly mechanical design, according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention.<br><br>

Reference is now made to Fig. 9 which is a block diagram schematically illustrating a digital pen having two acoustic transmitters according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention.<br>
A digital pen 900 may have two acoustic transmitters 930. Installing two acoustic transmitters in a digital pen may have several advantages, which may include, but are not limited to the following:<br>
1)	Allowing the receiver to estimate the five dimensional (5D) location of the pen which includes the three dimensional location, and leaning angles of the digital pen, or a six dimensional (6D) location of the pen, which includes the five directional (5D) location as well data relating to rotation of the digital pen.<br>

Reference is now made to Fig. 10 which is a diagram schematically illustrating a digital sleeve for a writing instrument, according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention.<br>
The digital sleeve 1000 comprises an acoustic signal transmitter, for transmitting an acoustic signal. The digital sleeve 1000 may also comprise an electric circuit, a power source, or other elements, as described for a digital pen hereinabove.<br>
A digital sleeve 1000, according to a preferred embodiment, may be mounted on a regular writing instrument 1100, such as a pen, a pencil, a marker, etc.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the digital sleeve 1000 may be worn on a finger. For example, Epos Technologies™ provides a stylus-at-your-fingertip product.<br><br>
Preferably, the digital sleeve 10000 further includes a writing sensor 10200. The writing sensor 10200 is configured for detecting a movement (or a friction) of the writing device 10100, relative to the digital sleeve 10000 mounted thereon.<br>
That is to say, as a user, holding a pen mounted with the sleeve 1000, starts writing with the pen, a relative movement (or friction) occurs between the pen touching a paper and the sleeve 1000. The relative movement (or friction) is sensed by the writing sensor 10200. The writing sensor 10200 in turn, actuates the acoustic transmitter, through electric circuitry. Then, the acoustic transmitter transmits the acoustic signals, say to a receiving unit, as described in greater detail for a digital pen system herein below.<br>
Reference is now made to Fig. lla-e, which are schematic depictions of a digital pen's grating for a writing instrument, according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Typically, an acoustic transmitter, specifically - an ultra sound transducer has some irregularities. The irregularities make the transducer not entirely omni directional.<br>
The irregularities result from a part of the transducer having an inherent defect, because the transducer is made from a rectangular foil laminated to form a cylinder. The lamination forms a passive part which does not radiate acoustic energy. The inherent defect causes the signal in front of the defect to be much weaker than in front of other parts of the ultrasound transducer.<br>
Typically, the position of the digital pen is determined utilizing an algorithm, based on a measurement of TOA (time of arrival) of the acoustic signals from the acoustic transmitter. Usually the algorithm compares the TOA of the signals with IR signals transmitted from the digital pen.<br><br>
As a result of the inherent defect, the sum of the signals received at a given point in the space surrounding the acoustic transmitter has a phase shift, in comparison to other points at a similar distance away from the acoustic transmitter,<br>
A digital pen, according to a preferred embodiment, includes an acoustic wave guide, positioned adjacent to an acoustic transmitter of the digital pen.<br>
Preferably, the acoustic wave guide comprises a plurality of fins 1110 radiating outwardly in a direction away from the acoustic signal transmitter.<br>
More preferably, the fins 1110 are positioned so as to spatially divide the space surrounding the acoustic transmitter into directional sectors.<br>
The fins 1110 substantially isolate acoustic signals transmitted by the acoustic transmitter through one of the sectors from acoustic signals transmitted from the acoustic transmitter through the other sectors.<br>
That is to say, to eliminate the shift in location, the fins 1110 are positioned so to as to divide the space around the acoustic transmitter into sectors, such that each sector is decoupled or isolated from the other sectors.<br>
As a result of the division of space around the acoustic transmitter into significantly isolated sectors, the phase shift is significantly eliminated. The elimination of phase shift may improve the results of acoustic signal correlation based position decoding techniques. However, the amplitude of the sum of signals transmitted through each point in one of the sectors around the acoustic transmitter is reduced, as signals from the other sectors are significantly eliminated from the sector. Optionally, the grating around the acoustic transmitter may be designed differently than the above described fin design.<br><br>
For example, the grating may comprise a spiral opening keeping a single opening, a grating coming upwards combined with a grating coming downwards (keeping an opening to free air in between), etc.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the present invention, there is provided a receiver configured to receive acoustic signals transmitted from a digital pen, to be used for determining location of the digital pen, say for automatically digitizing hand writing carried out using the digital pen.<br>
Reference is now made to Fig. 12 which is a schematic depiction of a first receiving unit for receiving an acoustic signal from a digital pen, according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention.<br>
A receiving unit 1200, configured to receive acoustic signals from a digital pen may have a metal plate 1210 mounted on the body 1220 of the receiving unit, for securing the receiving unit 1200 to a sheet of paper.<br>
Pressing the metal plate one end 1210-a makes the other end 1210-b open a gap between the other end 1210-b and the body 1220 of the receiving unit 1200. Through the opened gap, a sheet of paper may be inserted between the plate's end 1210-b and the body 1220 of the receiving unit 1200.<br>
Releasing the metal plate pressed end 1210-a makes the other end 1210-b get back to its natural position and embed a force on the paper sheet which is pressed between the plate's end 1210-b and the body 1220 of the receiving unit 1210.<br>
The metal plate 1210 and the body 1220 of the receiving unit 1200 may have additional non-flat surface properties (such as rubber pads) which allow more friction between the paper and the receiving unit's body 1220.<br>
Preferably, the metal plate 1210 may be shaped, so as to cause a slight deformation of the paper, in order to have abetter grip of the paper sheet<br><br>
One or more receiving unit(s) 1200 may be fit on the paper sheet's center, or on the sheet's edges.<br>
Preferably, the receiving unit body 1200 and plate have stoppers 1212 that fit the 90 degrees of a paper sheet's corner (and hold the receiving unit at 45 degrees).<br>
The placement of the receiving unit 1200 on the corner of the paper sheet instead on the sheet's middle has several benefits, such as: Repeatability , Accuracy — a receiving unit placed on the corner has a better perspective, improving its accuracy, Less dead zones - as the operating angle of a receiving unit placed at the corner of the paper sheet is much smaller than when a receiving unit is place in the middle of the paper.<br>
Reference is now made to Fig. 13 which is a schematic depiction of a second receiving unit for receiving an acoustic signal from a digital pen, according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention.<br>
A receiving unit 1300, according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention includes two microphones 1330.<br>

Electret microphones are miniature microphones that work on condenser microphone principles, as known in the art, but have permanently charged polymer diaphragms. Electret microphones have miniature preamplifiers built in, and require low voltage direct current (DC) power (typically from a 1.5 to 18 volts battery).<br>
Electret microphones are widely used in hand held devices - such as mobile computer games, mobile phones, etc.<br>
The receiving unit 1300 further includes an electric circuit.<br><br>

Preferably, the processor may be configured to trigger a predefined functionality when a user places the digital pen in a predefined area.<br>
Optionally, the user may be provided a printed map or menus, and position the receiving unit(s) on the map or menus. When the user positions the digital pen on an icon, representing the predefined area, printed on the paper, the digital pen is present in the predefined area. Consequently, the predefined functionality is triggered by the processor.<br><br>
For example, the user may be provided a printed menu having drawn icons such as an eraser, a marker, etc. The user may deploy the receiving unit(s) on the printed menus. If the user places the digital pen on the eraser icon, the processor switches into an erasing mode and the digital pen functions as an eraser. If the user places the digital pen on the marker icon, the processor switches into a marker mode and the digital pen functions as a marker.<br>
Preferably, the housing of 1320 of the receiving unit 1300 is used as an assembly jig. A worker assembling the receiving unit 1300 may insert the microphones 1330 into their position inside the body 1320, and solder a printed electric circuit board (PCB) into a position inside the body 1320. The worker may then connect the PCB to the microphones 1330.<br>
Optionally, the receiving unit 1300 may be removable attached to another item, such as a paper clipboard used by a student, etc.<br>
Preferably, the housing 1320 of the receiving unit 1300 includes a changeable cover element.<br>
The changeable element may provide a user of the receiving unit 1300, a manufacturer of the receiving unit 1300, or both, with the option to change the color and appearance of the receiving unit 1300.<br>
Optionally, the housing 1320 of the receiving unit 1300 may also house a serial interface cable, rolled in and out from the housing. Preferably, a connector at the end of the interface cable may be clipped to the housing 1320. The housed interface cable helps to keep the receiving compact.<br>
Reference is now made to Fig. 14 which is a simplified block diagram illustrating a digital pen system, according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention.<br><br>
A digital pen system 1400 includes a digital pen 1410, and one or more digital pen receivers) 1420, as described in greater detail hereinabove.<br>
The system 1400 further includes a processor 1450, communicating with the receiving units(s) 1420.<br>
The processor 1450 is configured to process acoustic signals, transmitted from the digital pen 1410 and received by the receiving unit(s) 1420.<br>
Through the processing of the received acoustic signals, the processor 1420 determines the location of the digital pen 1410.<br>

According to a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the location of the digital pen according to the acoustic signals transmitted from the digital pen is carried out utilizing a decoding algorithm. The decoding algorithm may be implemented in a decoding unit 1470. The decoding unit 1470 may be implemented as a part of the processor 1450, as a part of a device communicating with to the processor 1450, as a part of the receiving unit(s) 1420, etc.<br>
Reference is now made to Fig. 15 which is a simplified block diagram illustrating a decoding unit, according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention.<br>
A decoding unit 70 includes a maximum likelihood detector 72, which uses a channel mathematical signal model 77, a correlator 71, a maximum likelihood detector, a path estimator and transmitter timing estimator.<br>
The maximum likelihood detector 72 generates most likely distance data, 5     relating to the distance of the digital pen from a receiving unit, based on the acoustic<br><br>
signals received from the digital pen, and feeds the path estimator 73 with the most likely distance data.<br>
The maximum likelihood detector 72 estimates the transmitter position and feeds the path estimator 73 with several options for location of the transmitter, each option having a probability associated therewith. The path estimator 73 further uses previously calculated possible positions from a sampling bank 75 (and their probabilities), provided by a transmitter timing estimator 76, in order to choose the right estimated coordinates 74 of the position of the transmitter<br>
The decoding algorithm is used to convert digitized versions of the digital pen's acoustic signals into position coordinates for passing to a local computer operating system, a computer application, or the like.<br>
The decoding algorithm preferably takes into account the relatively low sampling frequency capabilities likely to be available, by carrying out frequency down conversion. Preferably, the path estimator 73 uses known in the art methods of interpolation, for compensating for the relatively low sampling rate.<br>
In addition, the algorithm preferably includes an ability to handle noise.<br>
The algorithm is preferably adapted for other specific issues, involved in the handling of the acoustic signals transmitted from the digital pen.<br>
Traditional position location methods concentrate on the use of very short and energetic acoustic signals, as the location signal. In order to achieve good resolution, the traditional methods dictate high sampling frequencies, typically higher than 400KHz, in order to be able to find such short location signals and not miss them entirely.<br><br>
By contrast, the present embodiments preferably do not use sampling rates higher than 44.1 KHz, since such frequencies are incompatible with the installed base of sound processing equipment, such as the electret microphones.<br>
Furthermore, it is recommended to keep the beacon signal sound frequency higher than 20KHz, that is within the ultrasonic range, so that users do not hear it<br>
In another preferred embodiment of the invention, the sampling rate may be higher than the 44. lKHz, say lOOKHz. This is possible by a receiving unit which is configured for a high sampling rate. The higher sampling rate enables better noise rejection of the audio band and higher bandwidth of the transmitted signal.<br>
A preferred embodiment of the present invention uses a solution in which data is modulated over an ultrasonic carrier signal or waveform. The data can be frequency modulated (FM), or phase modulated (PM), onto the carrier comprising the ultrasonic signal. Optionally, other known method may be used.<br>
The decoding algorithm preferably decodes the modulated signal and reconstructs the original position-information bearing signal from the results of sampling thereof. In the present embodiment, it is preferred to use band-limited signals in order to achieve a desired resolution level.<br>
Preferably, continuous wave (CW) modulations such as spread spectrum and frequency hopping are used in acoustic position finding, to overcome reverberation and multi-path effects.<br>
A preferred embodiment of the present invention uses the maximum likelihood detector 72, for decoding the signals received from the receiving units, to determine the distances of the digital pen from the individual receiving unit(s).<br>
At the maximum likelihood detector 72, the acoustic signals received from the receiving units are compared to reference signals in a look-up table (LUT) 68.<br><br>
The comparison indicates a most likely signal, and from the most likely signal, a distance is determined as the distance from which the signal was most likely transmitted.<br>
The maximum likelihood detector 72 preferably uses a full mathematical signal model 77 of the channel, against which to compare received signals, so that a best match distance can be found.<br>
As an alternative, the expected waveform can be sampled at the Nyquist rate, and any timing mismatch between the sampling points can be overcome by extrapolation fiinctions, to reveal the distance.<br>
Reference is now made to Fig. 16, which is a simplified block diagram illustrating exemplary components of a mathematical model for incorporating into a maximum likelihood detector, according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention.<br>
The model 20 comprises an initial signal sequence S(t), generated in the signal generator, which is fed into the transfer function of the acoustic transmitter 26 with its filter 25. The digital pen 14 is followed by the channel 27. The result is then fed to the reception path in the receiver which includes transfer function 29 for the ultrasound receiver, and filtering 30.<br>
The full modeling of the channel is useful in the design of the maximum likelihood detector 72, in that it allows accurate expected signals to be constructed against which the received acoustic signals, ideally, differ only in phase.<br>
The detector (estimator) 70 is then relatively easily able to distinguish the most likely signal, which in turn corresponds to the most likely distance of the digital pen from the receiving unit.<br><br>
Preferably, the infrared (IR) signal transmitted from the IR transmitters, spread on the face of the digital pen, are used to set the start of the delay, and also to synchronize clocks between the digital pen and the receivers.<br>
In figure 15, synchronization path 16 is also indicated on the model. A skilled person will appreciate that acoustic signals have differing angular transfer functions. An equalizer may be used in order to compensate for this fact. The skilled person will appreciate that, instead of a model, a look-up table may be used. Furthermore, other detectors may be used, and there are several known decoders of FM signals, such as PLL (An electronic circuit that consists of a phase detector, low pass fdter and voltage-controlled oscillator), I/Q demodulation, phase multiplication etc.<br>
Reference is briefly made to Fig. 17, which is a two-part graph showing an exemplary correlation function, according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention.<br>
