PROVISIONAL/COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10]<br>
"SEAT LOCK UNLOCKING DEVICE"<br>
HONDA GIKEN KOGYO KABUSHIKI KAISHA, a corporation of Japan, 1-1, Minamiaoyama 2-chome, Minato-ku, Tokyo, Japan<br>
The  following  specification  particularly  describes  the   nature  of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed :-<br><br>
The present invention relates to seat lock unlocking device.<br>
[Detailed Description of the Invention] [0001]<br>
[Technical Field to which the Invention Pertains] The present invention relates to a seat lock unlocking device in which a seat lock is unlocked by a key operation. [0002]<br><br>
[Prior Art]<br>
A seat portion of a motorcycle or autotricycle of the motor scooter type is generally so constructed that an upper opening of a helmet storage box is closed with a seat and the seat is locked by a seat lock.  In such a construction, a seat lock unlocking device is adopted in which a seat lock unlocking key cylinder is provided at a cover covering the surroundings of the helmet storage box, and the seat lock is connected to the key cylinder through a wire cable. A key inserted in the seat lock unlocking key cylinder is operated to draw the wire cable, whereby the seat lock can be unlocked.<br>
[0003]<br>
Generally, the key is commonly used for both the seat lock unlocking key cylinder and an ignition key cylinder.  To insert the key into the seat lock unlocking key cylinder and to insert the key into the ignition key cylinder is troublesome. As a seat lock unlocking device which dissolves the troublesomeness of such a key operation, there has been known, for example, the publication of Japanese Patent No. 2913764, "Electric System Circuit Device for Motorcycle or the Like" (hereinafter referred to as "the prior art").<br>
[0004]<br><br>
The above-mentioned prior art, as shown in Figures 1 and 2 of the publication, resides in that a mechanism for unlocking the lock of the helmet storage box is assembled in an ignition switch 15 (numerals used in the publication are used here and hereinafter).<br>
The ignition switch 15 is provided with "parking position P", "lock position LOCK", "engine stop position OFF", "fuel feed position FUEL", "engine operation position ON" and "helmet storage box unlocking position OPEN" disposed clockwise in this order on an operation surface, with a key insertion hole as a center.<br>
A key inserted in the key insertion hole is turned to adjust it to the "helmet storage box unlocking position OPEN", whereby an unlocking solenoid 6 is excited, and the lock of the helmet storage box can be unlocked. [0005] [Problems to Be Solved by the Invention]<br>
In Figure 2 of the above-mentioned publication, in order to stop the engine by turning the key to "engine stop position OFF" after stoppage of the motorcycle and to open the helmet storage box, the key is to be turned from "engine stop position OFF" to "helmet storage box unlocking position OPEN" by once passing through "engine<br><br>
operation position ON". Therefore, the operation angle by which the key is turned is necessarily large, and such an unlocking operation is intricate and troublesome.<br>
[0006]<br>
For dissolving  the above problem,   in   the  above-mentioned prior art, it may be contemplated (D to provide "helmet storage box unlocking position OPEN" between "lock position LOCK" and "engine stop position OFF" or (2) to provide "helmet storage box unlocking position OPEN" in the condition of being overlapped with "engine stop position OFF" or "lock position LOCK".  However, generally, in order to prevent misoperation, a handle lock mechanism is adopted in which changeover from "engine stop position OFF" to "lock position LOCK" is achieved by turning the key while pushing in the key.  Therefore, in order to mechanically unlock the lock of the helmet storage box, namely, to unlock the seat lock at the positions of the above (D or (2), it is necessary to simultaneously realize both handle locking and seat unlocking, which is not advantageous because the mechanical structure of the ignition switch 15 becomes extremely complicate.<br>
[0007]<br>
Accordingly,   it is  an object  of   the present invention to provide a seat lock unlocking device<br><br>
enhanced in seat lock unlocking operation property with simple structure. [0008] [Means for Solving the Problems]<br>
In order to attain the above object, the present •' 'invention provides for a seat lock unlocking device including a lock unlocking member extended from a seat lock for locking a seat, the tip end of the lock unlocking member connected to a displacement member displaced by a key operation, and the seat lock being capable of being unlocked by a key operation,  the displacement member is assembled in an ignition key cylinder, the ignition key cylinder is provided with a seat lock unlocking position between an OFF position and an ON position of a vehicle power source, and the displacement member is displaced to a seat lock unlocking direction when a key is adjusted to the"seat lock unlocking position and pushed in. [0009]<br>
The seat lock unlocking position is disposed between the OFF position for stopping the engine and the ON position for starting the engine or providing a startable condition. Therefore, the operation angle by which the key is turned at the time of seat lock<br><br>
unlocking operation may be small, and seat lock "unlocking operation property is high. Further, the ignition key cylinder can be simple in structure, as compared with the case where the seat lock unlocking position is disposed between the handle lock position and the OFF position.<br>
The displacement member is displaced to the seat lock unlocking direction when the key adjusted to the seat lock unlocking position is pushed in.  When the key i's simply turned from the OFF position to the ON position or from the ON position to the OFF position, the displacement member is not displaced to the seat lock unlocking direction.  Thus, misoperation or influence is not exerted on the normal ON-OFF operations of the key, so that key operation property can be secured sufficiently. [0010]<br>
The present invention further disclose that the igni tion key cylinder is provided with an opening - closing shutter for opening and closing a key insertion hole and a locking mechanism for such locking that the opening-closing shutter, cannot be opened.<br>
When the key is not inserted into the key insertion hole, the key insertion hole is closed with the opening-closing shutter, and such locking that the opening-<br><br>
closing shutter cannot be opened is achieved.  Anti-mischief and antitheft effects are more enhanced. [0011]<br>
The ignition key-cylinder is so constructed that1 the key cannot be drawn out at the seat lock unlocking position.<br>
To drawn out the key from the key insertion hole, the key is adjusted to a position different from the seat lock unlocking position.  There is no fear that the displacement member would continue to be displaced to the seat lock unlocking direction after the key is drawn out. [0012]<br>
The lock unlocking member is constituted of a cable member, the cable member is extended downwards from the ignition key cylinder disposed at a portion of a leg shield through a space portion formed by a front cover and the leg shield, and is further extended to the seat lock by way of the lower side of a step floor, and at least a portion of the cable member which is passed through the space portion is passed through a pipe-shaped cable protector. [0013]<br>
Since the lock unlocking member is constituted of' the cable member, it is easy to lay the lock unlocking<br><br>
member from the ignition key cylinder to the seat lock.<br>
Further, since the cable member is passed through the space portion formed by the front cover and the leg shield and by way of the lower side of the step floor, the cable member cannot be seen from the exterior. Therefore, anti-mischief property can be enhanced, and appearance of the vehicle can be enhanced.<br>
In addition, at the portion of the front cover, a double structure is adopted in which the cable member passed through the cable protector is further passed through the space portion formed by the front cover and the leg shield.  Therefore, anti-mischief property can be more enhanced. [0014] [Mode for Carrying Out the Invention]<br>
An embodiment of the present invention will be described below based on the accompanying drawings. The terms "front", "rear", "left", "right", "upper" and "lower" are used according to the directions as viewed from the driver, and Fr means the front side, Rr means the rear side, L means the left side, and R means the right side.

Furthermore, in the space portion Sp, the cable member 85 is protected by the double structure of the cover member (the front cover 31 and the leg shield 32) and the cable protector 91. Therefore, the anti-mischief property can be more enhanced. [0024]<br>
Figure 3 is a perspective view of the vicinity of an ignition key cylinder fitting portion according to the present invention, and shows the construction in which a bracket 92 of the ignition key cylinder 41 is fitted to the head pipe 11a by small screws 93, 93, as viewed from the right side of the vehicle body. The figure is partly sectional with respect to a part of the ignition key cylinder 41. [0025]<br>
The ignition key cylinder 41 includes an opening-closing shutter mechanism 130 for opening and closing a key insertion hole. Details of the opening-closing shutter mechanism 130 will be described later. The cable protector 91 is fitted to the head pipe 11a by fitting it<br><br>
to a stay 94 for fitting the horn 58 to the head pipe 11a, by a clamp member 95. [0026]<br>
Figure 4 is a front view of the ignition key cylinder according to the present invention.<br>
The ignition key cylinder 41 is provided with an inner cap 104 at an operation surface 41a, and the inner cap 104 is provided with a key insertion hole 128 for inserting a key not shown. [0027]<br>
The ignition key cylinder 41 is provided with "lock position P1", "OFF position P2", "seat lock unlocking position P3" and "ON position P4" disposed clockwise in this order, with the key insertion hole 128 as a center, when the operation surface 41a is viewed from the front side as in this figure. The present invention is characterized in that the seat lock unlocking position P3 is provided between the OFF position P2 and the ON position P4.<br>
When the key not shown is adjusted to the lock position P1, the handle can be locked; when the key is adjusted to the OFF position P2, the engine can be stopped; when the key is  adjusted to the seat lock unlocking position P3, the seat lock can be unlocked; and<br><br>
when the key is adjusted to the ON position P4, starting of the engine or a startable condition can be provided. [0028]<br>
The angle between the lock position P1 and the OFF position P2 is 91, the angle between the OFF position P2 and the seat lock unlocking position P3 is 92, and the angle between the seat lock unlocking position P3 and the ON position P4 is 02.<br>
The angle 92 is 1/2 of the angle 91.  Therefore, the operation angle for turning the key from the OFF position P2 to the ON position P4 is 91, the same as in the conventional technology, and the seat lock unlocking position P3 is disposed within the key rotation angle 91. [0029]<br>
Thus, since the seat lock unlocking position P3 is provided between the OFF position P2 and the ON position P4 for the vehicle power source in the ignition key cylinder 41, the key rotation angle for turning the key from the OFF position P2 to the seat lock unlocking position P3 at the time of unlocking the seat lock is as small as 92.  Therefore, seat lock unlocking operation property is high. Further, the ignition key cylinder 41 can have a simpler constitution, as compared with the case where the seat lock unlocking position P3 is<br><br>
provided between the lock position P1 and the OFF position P2. [0030]<br>

The switch movable disk 111 has a recessed portion 111a for escape when the rear end of the crank shaft 105<br>
is slidden rearwards.  The fixed contact members 114 •  function also as terminals. A combination structure of the switch movable disk 111, the slide contact member 112, the base disk 113 and the fixed contact members 114  constitute a switch mechanism 117.  Symbol 118 denotes a compression spring for holding a contact pressure.<br>
The click mechanism 116 includes a groove 101b formed in a wall portion 101a of the cylinder main body 101, a ball 121 capable of being fitted in the groove 101b, and a compression spring 122 springily pressing the ball 121 to the side of the groove 101b. Symbol 119 denotes a retainer. [0033]<br>
Further, the ignition key cylinder 41 is characterized in that a displacement member 125 displaced by a key operation is assembled in. The displacement<br><br>
member 125 has a flange portion 125b provided with a through-hole 125d to be fitted with the straight shaft portion 105c of the crank shaft 105. Details of the displacement member 125 will be described later.<br>
Figure 5 further shows the condition where an opening-closing shutter mechanism 130 indicated by phantom lines is fitted to the operation side of the ignition key cylinder 41, and the key insertion hole 128 is closed with an opening-closing shutter 135 of the opening-closing shutter mechanism 130. [0034]<br>
Figure 6 is a view taken along arrow 6 of Figure 4, and shows the ignition key cylinder 41 from which the cover 102 shown in Figure 4 has been removed.<br>
In the ignition key cylinder 41, a displacement member storage portion 124 is provided at a portion of the cylinder main body 101, and the displacement member 125 is contained in the displacement member storage portion 124.<br>
The displacement member 125 is a cable lever which includes a slender plate shaped swing main body 125a swingably supported on the displacement member storage portion 124 by a small screw 126, a flange portion 125b formed by bending one end portion of the swing main body<br><br>
125a at a right angle, and a wire connecting portion 125c formed by bending the other end portion of the swing main body 125a at a right angle. The small screw 126 plays the role of a support shaft for supporting the displacement member 125. [0035]<br>
The flange portion 125b is faced to the step surface 105d of the crank shaft 105 and is provided with the above-mentioned through-hole 125d. The wire connecting portion 125c has a hook portion 125e for hooking one end portion 86a of the inner wire 86 in the cable member 85.<br>
The cable member 85 is a wire cable including the inner wire 86 covered with an outer tube 87.  One end portion 87a of the outer tube 87 is fitted to the displacement member storage portion 124.  In this manner, the cable member 85 can be connected to the displacement member 125. [0036]<br>
Figure 7 is a sectional view taken along line 7-7 of Figure 6, and shows the constitution in which an opening of the displacement member storage portion 124 is covered with the cover 102.<br>
The figure shows that the cover 102 is a member<br><br>
made of a resin, a thin wall portion 102a is provided at an intermediate portion of the cover 102 to thereby cause the thin wall portion 102a to function as a elastically deformable hinge, the tip end side of the thin wall portion 102a is made to be a lid portion 102b, and a hook portion 102c of th£ lid portion 102b is hooked on a latch portion 124a of the displacement member storage portion 124 for fixing.  By opening only the lid portion 102b, inspection, maintenance and replacement work of the cable member 85 relative to the displacement member 125 can be easily carried out/ [0037]<br>
Figures 8(a) and 8(b) are action views of the ignition key cylinder according to the present invention, wherein Figure 8(a) shows a major part of the ignition key cylinder 41, arid Figure 8(b) shows the vicinity of the displacement member 125.<br>
As shown in Figure 8(a), the crank shaft 105 can be pushed in to the rear side (right side in the figure) by adjusting the key 3-29 to the seat lock unlocking position P3 (See Figure 4) and pushing the key 129 in. At this time, the step surface 105d of the crank shaft 105 pushes in the flange portion 125b of the displacement member 125 to the rear side.<br><br>
As shown in Figure 8(b) , the displacement member 125 having the flange portion 125b pushed is displaced toward the seat lock unlocking direction, namely, swung clockwise, thereby pulling the inner wire 86.<br>
Thereafter, when the pushing-in of the key 129 is stopped, the crank shaft 105 is returned to its original position by the springy force of the compression spring 115. [0038]<br>
Thus, the seat lock unlocking device 84 is characterized in that the displacement member 125 is displaced to the seat lock unlocking direction when the key 129 is adjusted to the seat lock unlocking position P3 and is pushed in. Since the displacement member 125 is assembled in the ignition key cylinder 41, the seat lock 83 can be unlocked mechanically without intermediately using an electrical means. [0039]<br>
As is clear from the above description, although the seat lock unlocking position P3 is provided between the OFF position P2 and the ON position P4 shown in Figure 4, the displacement member 125 is not displaced to the seat lock unlocking direction when the key 129 is simply turned from the OFF position P2 to the ON position<br><br>
P4 or from the ON position P4 to the OFF position P2. Therefore, misoperation or influence would not be exerted on normal ON/OFF operations by the key 129, and key operation property can be sufficiently secured. [0040]<br>
The ignition key cylinder 41 is so constructed that the key 129 can be inserted and drawn out at the lock position P1 and the OFF position P2 shown in Figure 4, and the key 129 cannot be inserted or drawn out at the seat lock unlocking position P3 and the ON position P4 shown in Figure 4.  The constitution in which the key 129 cannot be drawn out may be achieved, for example, by a<br>
construction in which the tumbler disks 106 • • • (See Figure 5) in the condition where the key 129 is inserted in the key insertion hole 128 are locked at the positions P3 and P4. [0041]<br>
Since the ignition key cylinder 41 is so constructed that the key 129 cannot be drawn out at the seat lock unlocking position P3, in order to draw out the key 129 from the key insertion hole 128, the key 129 is adjusted to the lock position P1 or the OFF position P2 (a position different from the seat lock unlocking position P3). Therefore, there is no fear that the<br><br>
displacement member 125 continues to be displaced to the seat lock unlocking direction after the key 129 is drawn out.<br>
Further, the ignition key cylinder 41 is so constructed that automatic return from the seat lock unlocking position P3 to the OFF position P2 is achieved by a return spring not shown. [0042]<br>
Figure 9 is a front view of an opening - closing shutter mechanism according to the present invention.<br>
The opening-closing shutter mechanism 130 includes an opening-closing shutter 135 for opening and closing the key insertion hole indicated by phantom lines, and a locking mechanism 150 for locking such as to prevent the opening-closing shutter 135 from being opened.  In the opening-closing shutter mechanism 130, an operation surface 142 of a shutter cover 141 is provided with a key insertion hole 143, a shutter key insertion port 144, and a shutter stopper slot 145. The locking mechanism 150 is a magnet-type locking mechanism. [0043]<br>
Figure 10 is a sectional view taken along line 10-10 of Figure 9.<br>
The opening-closing shutter mechanism 130 is so<br><br>
constructed that an operating portion of the ignition key cylinder 41 indicated by phantom lines is covered by a shutter fitting base disk 131, a support shaft portion<br>
132	is extended from the shutter fitting base disk 131 to<br>
the operation side (left in the figure), a base portion<br>
of the opening-closing shutter 135 is rotatably supported<br>
on the support shaft portion 132, and a shutter cover 141<br>
covering the opening-closing shutter 135 is fitted to the<br>
shutter fitting base disk 131.<br>
[0044]<br>
The shutter fitting base disk 131 has a key insertion port 133 concentric with the key insertion port 143 of the shutter cover 141. These key insertion ports<br>
133	and 143 are opened and closed by the opening-closing<br>
shutter 135, whereby the key insertion hole 128 (See<br>
Figure 9) of the ignition key cylinder 41 can be opened<br>
and closed. The support shaft portion 132 is disposed<br>
concentrically with the shutter key insertion port 144 of<br>
the shutter cover 141.<br>
The opening-closing shutter 135 is constituted of a projected portion 136 projected into the shutter key insertion port 144, a key groove 137 provided at a tip end surface of the projected portion 136, and a flat plate shaped shutter plate 138 extended in the radial<br><br>
direction from the projected portion 136. Symbol 146 denotes an O-ring. [0045]<br>
Figure 11 is a front view of the opening-closing shutter according to the present invention, and shows<br>
that a plurality of permanent magnets 153 • • • are arranged on the back side of the key groove 137, when the opening-closing shutter 135 is viewed from the front side, and the shutter plate 138 is provided with a stopper pin 139. The plurality of permanent magnets 153 • • • are, for example, four pieces arranged at equal pitches on the basis of the center of the key groove 137.<br>
The profile of the key groove 137 is asymmetrical on the left and right sides with respect to the center of the key groove 137. Therefore, the shutter key described later can be inserted into the key groove 137 in only one direction. [0046]<br>
Figure 12 is a sectional view taken along line 12-12 of Figure 11, and shows a sectional constitution in which the opening-closing shutter 135 and the locking mechanism 150 are assembled on the shutter fitting base disk 131.<br>
The locking mechanism 150 is constituted of<br><br>
recessed portions 151 • • • formed at a tip end surface of the support shaft portion 132, recessed portions 152  • • formed on the back side of the key groove 137, permanent magnets 153 • • face/back slidably fitted to both of the recessed portions 151  ' ' and the recessed portions 152 * • ' , and compression springs 154 • • • intermediately disposed between the bottoms of the recessed portions 151 ' ' • on the side of the support shaft portion 132 and the permanent magnets 153 • • • .<br>
The permanent magnets 153 • ' ' are round bar shaped sliders.  The compression springs 154 • • • are springy members by which the permanent magnets 153 • • are springily urged to the side of the key groove 137. [0047]<br>
The permanent magnets 153  have their magnetic pole directions set on both end sides of sliding, namely, the side of the key groove 137 and the side of the counter-key groove 137. Of the magnetic poles of the permanent magnet 153, the pole on the side of the key groove 137 (hereinafter referred to as "operation side magnetic pole") is determined in consideration of locking and unlocking by a shutter key 160 indicated by phantom lines. [0048]<br><br>
In detail, the shutter key 160 incorporates a plurality of permanent magnets 161 • •  faced to the permanent magnets 153 • • • on the side of the opening-closing shutter mechanism 130 when the shutter key 160 is inserted in the key groove 137.  In addition, the magnetic poles of the faced permanent magnets 161 • • • on the side of the shutter key 160 are different from the magnetic poles of the permanent magnets 153 •  • on the side of the opening-closing shutter mechanism 130. [0049]<br>
Therefore, when the shutter key 160 is inserted in the key groove 137, the permanent magnets 153 • • • on the side of the opening-closing shutter mechanism 130 repel<br>
the permanent magnets 161 '  ' on the side of the shutter key 160, and are retracted against the springy force of the compression springs 154 •  • . As a result, the permanent magnets 153  • • . on the side of the opening-closing shutter mechanism 130 come off from the recessed<br>
portions 152 • • • on the side of the key groove 137. By turning the shutter key 160 in this condition, the opening-closing shutter 135 can be opened and closed. [0050]<br>
Further, the opening-closing shutter mechanism 130 includes a click mechanism 147 for holding the opening-<br><br>
closing shutter 135 in a stopped condition at a closed position and an open position. The click mechanism 147 is constituted of a groove 135a formed on the back side of the opening-closing shutter 135, a ball 148 capable of being fitted  in   the  groove 235a, and a compression spring 149 for springily urging the ball 148 to the side of the groove 135a. [0051]<br>
Description will be continued by once returning to Figure 11.  In the permanent magnets 153 • • • on the side of the opening-closing shutter mechanism 130, the number of combinations of the magnetic poles (N pole, S pole) is extremely large.  By appropriately combining these magnetic poles, a multiplicity of kinds of lock can be set. The shape, the number of pieces and arrangements of the plurality of permanent magnets 153 • •  and 161  • • are arbitrary. [0052]<br>
Figures 13 (a) to 13 (c) are action views of the opening-closing shutter mechanism according to the present invention.<br>
The figure 13(a) shows the condition where the key insertion hole 128  is  closed with   the opening-closing shutter 135. The locking mechanism 150 is in a locking<br><br>
condition.  Since the stopper pin 139 is in contact with one end of the shutter stopper slot 145, the opening-closing shutter 135 cannot be swung more counterclockwise in the figure.<br>
In order to operate the ignition key cylinder 41, first, the shutter key 160 is positioned to the key groove 137 and is inserted. As a result, the permanent magnets 153  ' ' on the side of the opening-closing mechanism 130 are retracted, so that the locking mechanism 150 comes into an unlocking condition. [0053]<br>
Next, as shown in Figure 13(b), the shutter key 160 is turned clockwise in the figure. As a result, the opening-closing shutter 135 is swung clockwise in the figure. At this time, the stopper pin 139 is moved within the shutter stopper slot 145.<br>
Figure 13(c) shows the condition where the key insertion hole 128 is opened by swinging the opening-closing shutter 135 clockwise in the figure.  Since the stopper pin 139 comes into contact with the other end of the shutter stopper slot 145, the opening-closing shutter 135 cannot be swung more clockwise in the figure.<br>
Subsequently, the shutter key 160 is drawn out of the key groove 137, and the key 129 is inserted into the<br><br>
key insertion hole 128 and is turned to an arbitrary position.<br>
After the key 129 is drawn out of the key insertion hole 128, the shutter key 160 is again inserted into the key groove 137 to unlock the locking mechanism 150, and the shutter key 160 is turned counterclockwise in the figure, whereby the key insertion hole 128 is closed by the opening-closing shutter 135. [0054]<br>
As described above, according to the present invention, when the key 129 is not inserted in the key insertion hole 128, the key insertion hole 128 is closed with the opening-closing shutter 135, and locking such as to prevent the opening-closing shutter 135 from being opened can be achieved by the locking mechanism 150.<br>
In the above-mentioned prior art (Japanese Patent No. 2913764), the opening-closing shutter for opening and closing the key insertion hole and the locking mechanism for such locking as to prevent the opening-closing shutter from being opened are not provided.  In contrast, according to the present invention, the ignition key cylinder 41 is provided with the opening-closing shutter mechanism 130, so that anti-mischief and antitheft effects can be more enhanced.<br><br>
[0055]<br>
Figure 14 is a back view of a seat lock according to the present invention.<br>
The seat lock 83 is constituted of a frame portion 172 provided with a U-groove 171, a locking claw 174 rotatably fitted to the frame portion 172 through a support pin 173, a tension spring 177 for springily urging the locking claw 174 in an unlocking direction (clockwise in the figure), a latch member 182 rotatably fitted to the frame portion 172 through a support pin 181, and a compression spring 185 for springily urging the latch member 182 in a locking direction (counterclockwise in the figure).<br>
[0056]<br>
The tension spring 177 generates a force for pushing up the seat 19 (See Figure 2) by the locking claw 174, while the compression spring 185 generates only a force for returning the latch member 182 to a position for latching the locking claw 174, so that the compression spring 185 may have a spring force smaller than that of the tension spring 177; therefore, a force for unlocking the seat lock 83 by the inner wire 86 suffices, and operation is easy.<br>
[0057]<br><br>
The locking claw 174 includes an upper claw 175 and a lower claw 176 formed roughly in the shape of letter "7"  , and the lock pin 82 is locked by the upper claw 175. The latch member 182 is a member provided with a projected portion 183 in the vicinity of the support pin 181, and provided with a connecting portion 184 for connecting the other end portion 86b of the inner wire 86 in the cable member 85 at a swing tip end portion.  The projected portion 183 is for latching the lower claw 176 in the locking claw 174 in a locking condition.  Symbol 187 denotes a stopper. [0058]<br>
Figure 15 is an action view (No. 1) of the seat lock according to the present invention, and shows an unlocked condition.<br>
With the lock; pin 82 pressed downwards together with the seat 19 (See Figure 2), the upper claw 175 of the locking claw 174 is pushed by the lock pin 82 and swung counterclockwise in the figure.  In the course of the swinging, the tip end of the lower claw 176 pushes the projected portion 183, thereby swinging the latch member 182 clockwise in the figure. The upper claw 175 latches the lock pin 82, thereby locking, when swung by a predetermined angle, The locked condition is shown by<br>
Figure 16. [0059]<br>
Figure 16 is an action view (No. 2) of the seat lock according to the present invention, and shows a locked condition.<br>
In the locked condition, the lower claw 176 is latched by the projected portion 183, so that the locking claw 174 cannot be swung in the unlocking direction (clockwise in the figure).<br>
Thereafter, with the key 129 operated for unlocking as shown in Figure 8, the displacement member 125 is displaced in the seat lock unlocking direction to pull the inner wire 86. As shown in Figure 16, the inner wire 86 swings the latch member 182 clockwise in the figure against the weak spring force of the compression spring 185. As a result, the lower claw 176 gets off from the projected portion 183. Therefore, the lock between the lock pin 82 and the upper claw 175 is broken, resulting in an unlocked condition. The unlocked condition is shown by Figure 17. [0060]<br>
Figure 17 is an action view (No. 3) of the seat lock according to the  present invention, and shows an unlocked condition.<br><br>
Thereafter, when an operating force for pulling the inner wire 86 is released by stopping the pushing-in of the key 129 (See Figure 8), the latch member 182 is swung counterclockwise in the figure by the springy force of the compression spring 185, and comes into contact with the stopper 187. Therefore, the projected portion 183 remains getting off from the lower claw 176. At this time, the latch member 182 swings the displacement member 125 (See Figure 8) by pulling the inner wire 86, thereby returning the displacement member 125 into the original condition.<br>
Namely, although it is difficult to secure a stroke for operating the inner wire 86 by the pushing-in operation of the key 129, unlocking of the seat lock 83 can be achieved by an operation against the weak spring force of the compression spring 185, so that the seat lock 83 can be unlocked compactly and with a small operational load by the pushing-in operation of the key 129. [0061]<br>

In claims 1 to 3, the lock unlocking member is not<br>
limited	to the cable member 85.<br>
[0071]<br>
[Effects of the Invention]<br>
The present invention, constituted as described above, displays the following effects.<br>
According to claim 1,   a seat lock unlocking position is provided between an OFF position and an ON position of a vehicle power source in an ignition key cylinder, so that the operation angle for turning a key from the OFF position to the seat lock unlocking position at the time of a seat lock unlocking operation can be small. Therefore, seat lock unlocking operation property is high.  Further, the ignition key cylinder can have a simpler structure, as compared with the case where the seat lock unlocking position is provided between a handle lock position and the OFF position. [0072]<br>
Further, according to. claim 1,   a displacement member displaced by a key operation is assembled in the<br><br>
ignition key cylinder, the ignition key cylinder is provided with the seat lock unlocking position between the OFF position and the ON position of the vehicle power source, and the displacement member is displaced to the seat lock unlocking direction when the key is adjusted to the seat lock unlocking position and pushed in.  Therefore, although the seat lock unlocking position is provided between the OFF position and the ON position, the displacement member would not be displaced to the seat lock unlocking direction when the key is only turned from the OFF position to the ON position or from the ON position to the OFF position.  Therefore, misoperation or influence is not exerted on normal ON/OFF operations, and key operation property can be secured sufficiently.<br>
[0073]     According to/claim 2),   the ignition key cylinder is provided with an opening-closing shutter for opening and closing a key insertion hole and a locking mechanism for locking such as to prevent the opening-closing shutter from being opened, so that it is possible to close the key insertion hole by the opening-closing shutter and to achieve such locking as to prevent the opening-closing shutter from being opened when the key is not inserted in the key insertion hole. Therefore, anti-mischief and<br><br>
antitheft effects can be enhanced more [0074]<br>
According to(claim 3   the ignition key cylinder is<br>
so constructed that the key cannot be drawn out at the<br>
seat lock unlocking position, so that, in order to draw<br>
out the key from the key insertion hole, the key is<br>
adjusted to a position different from the seat lock<br>
unlocking position.  Therefore, there is no fear that the<br>
displacement member would continue to be displaced to the<br>
seat lock unlocking direction after the key is drawn out.<br>
[0075]	<br>
According to claim 4 a lock unlocking member is constituted of a cable member, so that the lock unlocking member can be easily laid from the ignition key cylinder to the seat lock. Therefore, the number of steps for laying the lock unlocking member can be reduced.<br>
Further, the cable member is extended downward from the ignition key cylinder disposed at a portion of a leg shield through a space portion formed by a front cover and the leg shield, and is further extended to the seat lock by way of the lower side of a step floor, so that the cable member cannot be seen from the exterior. Therefore, anti-mischief property can be enhanced, and appearance of the vehicle can be enhanced.<br><br>
[0076]<br>
Further, according to,'claim 4, the cable member is extended downward from the ignition key cylinder disposed at a portion of the leg shield through a space portion formed by the front cover and the leg shield and is further extended to the seat lock by way of the lower side of the step floor, and at least a portion of the cable member which is passed through the spiuce portion is passed through a pipe-shaped cable protector, so that the cable member can be protected by a double structure of the cover member (the front cover and the leg shield) and the cable protector in the space portion. Therefore, the anti-mischief property can be enhanced. more..<br>
