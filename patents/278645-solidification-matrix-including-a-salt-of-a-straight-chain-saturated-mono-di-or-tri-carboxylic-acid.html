SOLIDIFICATION MATRIX INCLUDING A SALT OF A STRAIGHT<br>
CHAIN SATURATED MONO-, DI-, OR TRI- CARBOXYLIC ACID<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0001]	The present invention relates generally to the field of solidification<br>
and solidification matrices. In particular, the present invention relates to salts of<br>
straight chain saturated mono-, di-, and tri - carboxylic acids as part of a<br>
solidification matrix.<br>
[0002]	The use of solidification technology and solid block detergents in<br>
institutional and industrial operations was pioneered in the SOLID POWER® brand<br>
technology claimed in Fernholz et al., U.S. Reissue Pat. Nos. 32,762 and 32,818.<br>
Additionally, sodium carbonate hydrate cast solid products using substantially<br>
hydrated sodium carbonate materials was disclosed in Heile et al., U.S. Pat. Nos.<br>
4,595,520 and 4,680,134.<br>
[0003]	In more recent years, attention has been directed to producing highly<br>
effective detergent materials from less caustic materials such as soda ash, also<br>
known as sodium carbonate. Early work in developing the sodium carbonate based<br>
detergents found that sodium carbonate hydrate-based materials often swelled, (i.e.,<br>
were dimensionally unstable) after solidification. Such swelling can interfere with<br>
packaging, dispensing, and use. The dimensional instability of the solid materials<br>
relates to the unstable nature of various hydrate forms prepared in manufacturing the<br>
sodium carbonate solid materials. Early products made with hydrated sodium<br>
carbonate typically comprised of anhydrous, a one mole hydrate, a seven mole<br>
hydrate, a ten mole hydrate or more mixtures thereof. However, after the product<br>
had been manufactured and stored at ambient temperatures, the hydration state of the<br>
initial product was found to shift between hydrate forms, e.g., one, seven, and ten<br>
mole hydrates, resulting in dimensional instability of the block chemicals. In these<br>
conventional solid form compositions, changes in water content and temperature<br>
lead to structural and dimensional change, which may lead to a failure of the solid<br>
form, resulting in problems such as the inability of the solid form to fit into<br>
dispensers for use.<br>
 <br>
[0004]	Additionally, conventional solid alkaline detergents, particularly<br>
those intended for institutional and commercial use, generally require phosphates in<br>
their compositions. The phosphates typically serve multiple purposes in the<br>
compositions, for example, to control the rate of solidification, to remove and<br>
suspend soils, and as an effective hardness sequestrant. It was found, disclosed, and<br>
claimed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,258,765, 6,156,715, 6,150,324, and 6,177,392, that a<br>
solid block functional material could be made using a binding agent that includes a<br>
carbonate salt, an organic acetate, such as an aminocarboxylate, or phosphonate<br>
component and water. Due to ecological concerns, further work has recently been<br>
directed to replacing phosphorous-containing compounds in detergents. In addition,<br>
nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA)-containing aminocarboxylate components used in place<br>
of phosphorous-containing compounds in some instances as a binding agents and<br>
hardness sequestrants, are believed to be carcinogenic. As such, their use has also<br>
been curtailed.<br>
[0005]	There is an ongoing need to provide alternative solidification<br>
technologies which are phosphorous-free and/or NTA-free. However, the lack of<br>
predictability in the solidification process and the lack of predictability of<br>
dimensional stability in solid form compositions have hampered efforts to<br>
successfully replace phosphorous and/or NTA-containing components with<br>
environmentally-friendly substitutes.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
[0006]	A solidification matrix includes a straight chain saturated carboxylic<br>
acid salt, sodium carbonate, and water. The straight chain saturated carboxylic acid<br>
salt is selected from a salt of a mono-, di-, or tri- carboxylic acid. The solidification<br>
matrix may be used, for example, in a solid detergent composition.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0007]	The solidification matrix of the present invention may be employed<br>
in any of a wide variety of situations in which a dimensionally stable solid product is<br>
desired. The solidification matrix is dimensionally stable and has an appropriate rate<br>
of solidification. In addition, the solidification matrix may be substantially free of<br>
 <br>
phosphorous and NTA, making the solidification matrix particularly useful in<br>
cleaning applications where it is desired to use an environmentally friendly<br>
detergent. Such applications include, but are not limited to: machine and manual<br>
warewashing, presoaks, laundry and textile cleaning and destaining, carpet cleaning<br>
and destaining, vehicle cleaning and care applications, surface cleaning and<br>
destaining, kitchen and bath cleaning and destaining, floor cleaning and destaining,<br>
cleaning in place operations, general purpose cleaning and destaining, industrial or<br>
household cleaners, and pest control agents. Methods suitable for preparing a solid<br>
detergent composition using the solidification matrix are also provided.<br>
[0008]	The solidification matrix generally includes a straight chain saturated<br>
mono-, di-, or tri- carboxylic acid salt, sodium carbonate (soda ash), and water for<br>
forming solid compositions. Suitable component concentrations for the<br>
solidification matrix range from between approximately 1% and approximately 15%<br>
by weight of a saturated straight chain saturated mono-, di-, or tri- carboxylic acid<br>
salt, between approximately 2% and approximately 50% by weight water, and<br>
between approximately 20% and approximately 70% by weight sodium carbonate.<br>
Particularly suitable component concentrations for the solidification matrix range<br>
from between approximately 1% and approximately 12% of a salt of a saturated<br>
straight chain saturated mono-, di-, or tri- carboxylic acid, between approximately<br>
5% and approximately 40% by weight water, and between approximately 45% and<br>
approximately 65% by weight sodium carbonate. More particularly suitable<br>
component concentrations for the solidification matrix range from between<br>
approximately 1% and approximately 10% of a salt of a saturated straight chain<br>
saturated mono-, di-, or tri- carboxylic acid, between approximately 5% and<br>
approximately 35% by weight water, and between approximately 50% and<br>
approximately 60% by weight sodium carbonate. Those skilled in the art will<br>
appreciate other suitable component concentration ranges for obtaining comparable<br>
properties of the solidification matrix.<br>
[0009]	The actual solidification mechanism of the solidification matrix<br>
occurs through ash hydration, or the interaction of the sodium carbonate with water.<br>
It is believed that the straight chain saturated mono-, di-, or tri- carboxylic acid salt<br>
functions to control the kinetics and thermodynamics of the solidification process<br>
 <br>
and provides a solidification matrix in which additional functional materials may be<br>
bound to form a functional solid composition. The straight chain saturated mono-,<br>
di-, or tri- carboxylic acid salt may stabilize the carbonate hydrates and the<br>
functional solid composition by acting as a donor and/or acceptor of free water. By<br>
controlling the rate of water migration for hydration of the ash, the straight chain<br>
saturated mono-, di-, or tri- carboxylic acid salt may control the rate of solidification<br>
to provide process and dimensional stability to the resulting product. The rate of<br>
solidification is significant because if the solidification matrix solidifies too quickly,<br>
the composition may solidify during mixing and stop processing. If the<br>
solidification matrix solidifies too slowly, valuable process time is lost. The straight<br>
chain saturated mono-, di-, or tri- carboxylic acid salt also provides dimensional<br>
stability to the end product by ensuring that the solid product does not swell. If the<br>
solid product swells after solidification, various problems may occur, including but<br>
not limited to: decreased density, integrity, and appearance; and inability to dispense<br>
or package the solid product. Generally, a solid product is considered to have<br>
dimensional stability if the solid product has a growth exponent of less than about<br>
3% and particularly less than about 2%.<br>
[0010]	The straight chain saturated mono-, di-, or tri- carboxylic acid salt is<br>
combined with water prior to incorporation into the detergent composition and can<br>
be provided as a solid hydrate or as a solid salt that is solvated in an aqueous<br>
solution, e.g., in a liquid premix. However, the straight chain saturated mono-, di-,<br>
or tri- carboxylic acid salt should be in a water matrix when added to the detergent<br>
composition for the detergent composition to effectively solidify. In general, an<br>
effective amount of straight chain saturated mono-, di-, or tri- carboxylic acid salt is<br>
considered an amount that effectively controls the kinetics and thermodynamics of<br>
the solidification system by controlling the rate and movement of water. Examples<br>
of particularly suitable salts of straight chain saturated monocarboxylic acids<br>
include, but are not limited to salts of acetic acid and salts of gluconic acid.<br>
Examples of particularly suitable salts of straight chain saturated dicarboxylic acids<br>
include, but are not limited to: salts of tartartic acid, salts of malic acid, salts of<br>
succinic acid, salts of glutaric acid, and salts of adipic acid. An example of a<br>
 <br>
particularly suitable salt of a straight chain saturated tricarboxylic acid includes, but<br>
is not limited to, a salt of citric acid.<br>
[0011]	Water may be independently added to the solidification matrix or<br>
may be provided in the solidification matrix as a result of its presence in an aqueous<br>
material that is added to the detergent composition. For example, materials added to<br>
the detergent composition may include water or may be prepared in an aqueous<br>
premix available for reaction with the solidification matrix component(s).<br>
Typically, water is introduced into the solidification matrix to provide the<br>
solidification matrix with a desired viscosity for processing prior to solidification<br>
and to provide a desired rate of solidification. The water may also be present as a<br>
processing aid and may be removed or become water of hydration. The water may<br>
thus be present in the form of aqueous solutions of the solidification matrix, or<br>
aqueous solutions of any of the other ingrethents, and/or added aqueous medium as<br>
an aid in processing. In addition, it is expected that the aqueous medium may help<br>
in the solidification process when is desired to form the concentrate as a solid. The<br>
water may also be provided as deionized water or as softened water.<br>
[0012]	The amount of water in the resulting solid detergent composition will<br>
depend on whether the solid detergent composition is processed through forming<br>
techniques or casting (solidification occurring within a container) techniques. In<br>
general, when the components are processed by forming techniques, it is believed<br>
that the solid detergent composition can include a relatively smaller amount of water<br>
for solidification compared with the casting techniques. When preparing the solid<br>
detergent composition by forming techniques, water may be present in ranges of<br>
between about 5% and about 25% by weight, particularly between about 7% and<br>
about 20% by weight, and more particularly between about 8% and about 15% by<br>
weight. When preparing the solid detergent composition by casting techniques,<br>
water may be present in the ranges of between about 15% and about 50% by weight,<br>
particularly between about 20% and about 45% by weight, and more particularly<br>
between about 22% and about 40% by weight.<br>
[0013]	The solidification matrix and resulting solid detergent composition<br>
may also exclude phosphorus or nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA) containing compounds,<br>
to make the solid detergent composition more environmentally acceptable.<br>
 <br>
Phosphorus-free refers to a composition, mixture, or ingrethents to which<br>
phosphorus-containing compounds are not added. Should phosphorus-containing<br>
compounds be present through contamination of a phosphorus-free composition,<br>
mixture, or ingrethent, the level of phosphorus-containing compounds in the<br>
resulting composition is less than approximately 0.5 wt %, less than approximately<br>
0.1 wt%, and often less than approximately 0.01 wt %. NTA-free refers to a<br>
composition, mixture, or ingrethents to which NTA-containing compounds are not<br>
added. Should NTA-containing compounds be present through contamination of an<br>
NTA-free composition, mixture, or ingrethent, the level of NTA in the resulting<br>
composition shall be less than approximately 0.5 wt %, less than approximately 0.1<br>
wt%, and often less than approximately 0.01 wt %. When the solidification matrix<br>
is NTA-free, the solidification matrix and resulting solid detergent composition is<br>
also compatible with chlorine, which functions as an anti-redeposition and stain-<br>
removal agent.<br>
Additional Functional Materials<br>
[0014]	The hydrated solidification matrix, or binding agent, can be used to<br>
form a solid detergent composition including additional components or agents, such<br>
as additional functional materials. As such, in some embodiments, the solidification<br>
matrix including the straight chain saturated mono-, di-, or tri- carboxylic acid salt,<br>
water, and sodium carbonate may provide a large amount, or even all of the total<br>
weight of the detergent composition, for example, in embodiments having few or no<br>
additional functional materials disposed therein. The functional materials provide<br>
desired properties and functionalities to the solid detergent composition. For the<br>
purpose of this application, the term "functional materials" includes a material that<br>
when dispersed or dissolved in a use and/or concentrate solution, such as an aqueous<br>
solution, provides a beneficial property in a particular use. Some particular<br>
examples of functional materials are discussed in more detail below, although the<br>
particular materials discussed are given by way of example only, and that a broad<br>
variety of other functional materials may be used. For example, many of the<br>
functional materials discussed below relate to materials used in cleaning and/or<br>
 <br>
destaining applications. However, other embodiments may include functional<br>
materials for use in other applications.<br>
Alkaline Source<br>
[0015]	The solid detergent composition can include an effective amount of<br>
one or more alkaline sources to enhance cleaning of a substrate and improve soil<br>
removal performance of the solid detergent composition. In general, it is expected<br>
that the composition will include the alkaline source in an amount of at least about<br>
5% by weight, at least about 10% by weight, or at least about 15% by weight. In<br>
order to provide sufficient room for other components in the concentrate, the<br>
alkaline source can be provided in the concentrate in an amount of less than about<br>
75% by weight, less than about 60% by weight, less than about 40% by weight, less<br>
than about 30% by weight, or less than about 20% by weight. The alkalinity source<br>
may constitute between about 0.1% and about 90% by weight, between about 0.5%<br>
and about 80% by weight, and between about 1% and about 60% by weight of the<br>
total weight of the solid detergent composition.<br>
[0016]	An effective amount of one or more alkaline sources should be<br>
considered as an amount that provides a use composition having a pH of at least<br>
about 8. When the use composition has a pH of between about 8 and about 10, it<br>
can be considered mildly alkaline, and when the pH is greater than about 12, the use<br>
composition can be considered caustic. In general, it is desirable to provide the use<br>
composition as a mildly alkaline cleaning composition because it is considered to be<br>
safer than the caustic based use compositions. In some circumstances, the solid<br>
detergent composition may provide a use composition that is useful at pH levels<br>
below about 8. In such compositions, the alkaline source may be omitted, and<br>
additional pH adjusting agents may be used to provide the use composition with the<br>
desired pH.<br>
[0017]	Examples of suitable alkaline sources of the solid detergent<br>
composition include, but are not limited to an alkali metal carbonate and an alkali<br>
metal hydroxide. Exemplary alkali metal carbonates that can be used include, but<br>
are not limited to: sodium or potassium carbonate, bicarbonate, sesquicarbonate, and<br>
mixtures thereof. Exemplary alkali metal hydroxides that can be used include, but<br>
 <br>
are not limited to sodium, lithium, or potassium hydroxide. The alkali metal<br>
hydroxide may be added to the composition in any form known in the art, including<br>
as solid beads, dissolved in an aqueous solution, or a combination thereof. Alkali<br>
metal hydroxides are commercially available as a solid in the form of prilled solids<br>
or beads having a mix of particle sizes ranging from about 12-100 U.S. mesh, or as<br>
an aqueous solution, as for example, as a 50% and a 73% by weight solution. It is<br>
preferred that the alkali metal hydroxide is added in the form of an aqueous solution,<br>
particularly a 50% by weight hydroxide solution, to reduce the amount of heat<br>
generated in the composition due to hydration of the solid alkali material.<br>
[0018]	In addition to the first alkalinity source, the solid detergent<br>
composition may comprise a secondary alkalinity source. Examples of useful<br>
secondary alkaline sources include, but are not limited to: metal silicates such as<br>
sodium or potassium silicate or metasilicate; metal carbonates such as sodium or<br>
potassium carbonate, bicarbonate, sesquicarbonate; metal borates such as sodium or<br>
potassium borate; and ethanolamines and amines. Such alkalinity agents are<br>
commonly available in either aqueous or powdered form, either of which is useful in<br>
formulating the present solid detergent compositions.<br>
Surfactants<br>
[0019]	The solid detergent composition can include at least one cleaning<br>
agent comprising a surfactant or surfactant system. A variety of surfactants can be<br>
used in a solid detergent composition, including, but not limited to: anionic,<br>
nonionic, cationic, and zwitterionic surfactants. Surfactants are an optional<br>
component of the solid detergent composition and can be excluded from the<br>
concentrate. Exemplary surfactants that can be used are commercially available<br>
from a number of sources. For a discussion of surfactants, see Kirk-Othmer,<br>
Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology, Third Edition, volume 8, pages 900-912.<br>
When the solid detergent composition includes a cleaning agent, the cleaning agent<br>
is provided in an amount effective to provide a desired level of cleaning. The solid<br>
detergent composition, when provided as a concentrate, can include the cleaning<br>
agent in a range of about 0.05% to about 20% by weight, about 0.5% to about 15%<br>
by weight, about 1% to about 15% by weight, about 1.5% to about 10% by weight,<br>
 <br>
and about 2% to about 5% by weight. Additional exemplary ranges of surfactant in<br>
a concentrate include about 0.5% to about 5% by weight, and about 1% to about 3%<br>
by weight.<br>
[0020]	Examples of anionic surfactants useful in the solid detergent<br>
composition include, but are not limited to: carboxylates such as alkylcarboxylates<br>
and polyalkoxycarboxylates, alcohol ethoxylate carboxylates, nonylphenol<br>
ethoxylate carboxylates; sulfonates such as alkylsulfonates, alkylbenzenesulfonates,<br>
alkylarylsulfonates, sulfonated fatty acid esters; sulfates such as sulfated alcohols,<br>
sulfated alcohol ethoxylates, sulfated alkylphenols, alkylsulfates, sulfosuccinates,<br>
and alkylether sulfates. Exemplary anionic surfactants include, but are not limited<br>
to: sodium alkylarylsulfonate, alpha-olefinsulfonate, and fatty alcohol sulfates.<br>
[0021]	Examples of nonionic surfactants useful in the solid detergent<br>
composition include, but are not limited to, those having a polyalkylene oxide<br>
polymer as a portion of the surfactant molecule. Such nonionic surfactants include,<br>
but are not limited to: chlorine-, benzyl-, methyl-, ethyl-, propyl-, butyl- and other<br>
like alkyl-capped polyethylene glycol ethers of fatty alcohols; polyalkylene oxide<br>
free nonionics such as alkyl polyglycosides; sorbitan and sucrose esters and their<br>
ethoxylates; alkoxylated amines such as alkoxylated ethylene diamine; alcohol<br>
alkoxylates such as alcohol ethoxylate propoxylates, alcohol propoxylates, alcohol<br>
propoxylate ethoxylate propoxylates, alcohol ethoxylate butoxylates; nonylphenol<br>
ethoxylate, polyoxyethylene glycol ether; carboxylic acid esters such as glycerol<br>
esters, polyoxyethylene esters, ethoxylated and glycol esters of fatty acids;<br>
carboxylic amides such as thethanolamine condensates, monoalkanolamine<br>
condensates, polyoxyethylene fatty acid amides; and polyalkylene oxide block<br>
copolymers. An example of a commercially available ethylene oxide/propylene<br>
oxide block copolymer includes, but is not limited to, PLURONIC®, available from<br>
BASF Corporation, Florham Park, NJ. An example of a commercially available<br>
silicone surfactant includes, but is not limited to, ABIL® B8852, available from<br>
Goldschmidt Chemical Corporation, Hopewell, VA.<br>
[0022]	Examples of cationic surfactants that can be used in the solid<br>
detergent composition include, but are not limited to: amines such as primary,<br>
secondary and tertiary monoamines with C18 alkyl or alkenyl chains, ethoxylated<br>
 <br>
alkylamines, alkoxylates of efhylenediamine, imidazoles such as a 1-(2-<br>
hydroxyethyl)-2-imidazoline, a 2-alkyl-1-(2-hydroxyethyl)-2-imidazoline, and the<br>
like; and quaternary ammonium salts, as for example, alkylquaternary ammonium<br>
chloride surfactants such as n-alkyl(C12-C18)dimethylbenzyl ammonium chloride,<br>
n-tetradecyldimethylbenzylammonium chloride monohydrate, and a naphthylene-<br>
substituted quaternary ammonium chloride such as dimethyl-1-<br>
naphthylmethylammonium chloride. The cationic surfactant can be used to provide<br>
sanitizing properties.<br>
[0023]	Examples of zwitterionic surfactants that can be used in the solid<br>
detergent composition include, but are not limited to: betaines, imidazolines, and<br>
propionates.<br>
[0024]	Because the solid detergent composition is intended to be used in an<br>
automatic dishwashing or warewashing machine, the surfactants selected, if any<br>
surfactant is used, can be those that provide an acceptable level of foaming when<br>
used inside a dishwashing or warewashing machine. Solid detergent compositions<br>
for use in automatic dishwashing or warewashing machines are generally considered<br>
to be low-foaming compositions. Low foaming surfactants that provide the desired<br>
level of detersive activity are advantageous in an environment such as a dishwashing<br>
machine where the presence of large amounts of foaming can be problematic. In<br>
addition to selecting low foaming surfactants, defoaming agents can also be utilized<br>
to reduce the generation of foam. Accordingly, surfactants that are considered low<br>
foaming surfactants can be used. In addition, other surfactants can be used in<br>
conjunction with a defoaming agent to control the level of foaming.<br>
[0025]	Some surfactants can also function as secondary solidifying agents.<br>
For example, anionic surfactants which have high melting points provide a solid at<br>
the temperature of application. Anionic surfactants which have been found most<br>
useful include, but are not limited to: linear alkyl benzene sulfonate surfactants,<br>
alcohol sulfates, alcohol ether sulfates, and alpha olefin sulfonates. Generally, linear<br>
alkyl benzene sulfonates are preferred for reasons of cost and efficiency.<br>
Amphoteric or zwitterionic surfactants are also useful in providing detergency,<br>
emulsification, wetting and conditioning properties. Representative amphoteric<br>
surfactants include, but are not limited to: N-coco-3-aminopropionic acid and acid<br>
 <br>
salts, N-tallow-3-iminodiproprionate salts, N-lauryl-3-iminodiproprionate disodium<br>
salt, N-carboxymethyl-N-cocoalkyl-N-dimethylammonium hydroxide, N-<br>

free acid wherein the alkyl group may be nonyl, undecyl, and heptadecyl. Other<br>
useful amphoteric surfactants include, but are not limited to: 1,1-<br>
bis(carboxymethyl)-2-undecyl-2-imidazolinium hydroxide disodium salt and oleic<br>
acid-ethylenediamine condensate, propoxylated and sulfated sodium salt, and amine<br>
oxide amphoteric surfactants.<br>
Builders or Water Conditioners<br>
[0026]	The solid detergent composition can include one or more building<br>
agents, also called chelating or sequestering agents (e.g., builders), including, but not<br>
limited to: a condensed phosphate, a phosphonate, an aminocarboxylic acid, or a<br>
polyacrylate. In addition, when sodium citrate is included in the solid detergent<br>
composition, the sodium citrate may also function as a builder. In general, a<br>
chelating agent is a molecule capable of coordinating (i.e., binding) the metal ions<br>
commonly found in natural water to prevent the metal ions from interfering with the<br>
action of the other detersive ingrethents of a cleaning composition. Preferable levels<br>
of addition for builders that can also be chelating or sequestering agents are between<br>
about 0.1% to about 70% by weight, about 1% to about 60% by weight, or about<br>
1.5% to about 50% by weight. If the solid detergent is provided as a concentrate,<br>
the concentrate can include between approximately 1 % to approximately 60% by<br>
weight, between approximately 3% to approximately 50% by weight, and between<br>
approximately 6% to approximately 45% by weight of the builders. Additional<br>
ranges of the builders include between approximately 3% to approximately 20% by<br>
weight, between approximately 6% to approximately 15% by weight, between<br>
 <br>
approximately 25% to approximately 50% by weight, and between approximately<br>
35% to approximately 45% by weight.<br>
[0027]	Examples of condensed phosphates include, but are not limited to:<br>
sodium and potassium orthophosphate, sodium and potassium pyrophosphate,<br>
sodium tripolyphosphate, and sodium hexametaphosphate. A condensed phosphate<br>
may also assist, to a limited extent, in solidification of the solid detergent<br>
composition by fixing the free water present in the composition as water of<br>
hydration.<br>
[0028]	Examples of phosphonates included, but are not limited to: 1-<br>
hydroxyethane-1, 1-diphosphonic acid, CH2C(OH)[PO(OH)2]2;<br>
aminotri(methylenephosphonic acid), N[CH2 PO(OH)2]3;<br>
aminotri(methylenephosphonate), sodium salt (ATMP), N[CH2PO(ONa)2]3; 2-<br>
hydroxyethyliminobis(methylenephosphonic acid), HOCH2CH2 N[CH2PO(OH)2]2;<br>
thethylenetriaminepenta(methylenephosphonic acid), (HO)2POCH2 N[CH2 CH2<br>
N[CH2 PO(OH)2]2]2; thethylenetriaminepenta(methylenephosphonate), sodium salt<br>
(DTPMP), C9 H(28-x) N3 NaxO15 P5 (x=7);<br>
hexamethylenediamine(tetramethylenephosphonate), potassium salt, C10H (28-x) N2KX<br>
O12 P4 (x=6); bis(hexamethylene)triamine(pentamethylenephosphonic acid),<br>
(HO2)POCH2 N[(CH2)2N[CH2 PO(OH)2]2]2; and phosphorus acid, H3PO3. A<br>
preferred phosphonate combination is ATMP and DTPMP. A neutralized or<br>
alkaline phosphonate, or a combination of the phosphonate with an alkali source<br>
prior to being added into the mixture such that there is little or no heat or gas<br>
generated by a neutralization reaction when the phosphonate is added is preferred.<br>
[0029]	The solid detergent compositions can contain a non-phosphorus<br>
based builder. Although various components may include trace amounts of<br>
phosphorous, a composition that is considered free of phosphorous generally does<br>
not include phosphate or phosphonate builder or chelating components as an<br>
intentionally added component. Carboxylates such as citrate or gluconate are<br>
suitable. Useful aminocarboxylic acid materials containing little or no NTA include,<br>
but are not limited to: N-hydroxyethylaminodiacetic acid,<br>
ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), hydroxyethylenediaminetetraacetic acid,<br>
thethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid, N-hydroxyethyl-ethylenediaminetriacetic acid<br>
 <br>
(HEDTA), thethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA), and other similar acids<br>
having an amino group with a carboxylic acid substituent.<br>
[0030]	Water conditioning polymers can be used as non-phosphorus<br>
containing builders. Exemplary water conditioning polymers include, but are not<br>
limited to: polycarboxylates. Exemplary polycarboxylates that can be used as<br>
builders and/or water conditioning polymers include, but are not limited to: those<br>
having pendant carboxylate (-CO2-) groups such as polyacrylic acid, maleic acid,<br>
maleic/olefin copolymer, sulfonated copolymer or terpolymer, acrylic/maleic<br>
copolymer, polymethacrylic acid, acrylic acid-methacrylie acid copolymers,<br>
hydrolyzed polyacrylamide, hydrolyzed polymethacrylamide, hydrolyzed<br>
polyamide-methacrylamide copolymers, hydrolyzed polyacrylonitrile, hydrolyzed<br>
polymethacrylonitrile, and hydrolyzed acrylonitrile-methacrylonitrile copolymers.<br>

Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology, Third Edition, volume 5, pages 339-366 and<br>
volume 23, pages 319-320, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference<br>
herein. These materials may also be used at substoichiometric levels to function as<br>
crystal modifiers<br>
Hardening Agents<br>
[0031]	The solid detergent compositions can also include a hardening agent<br>
in addition to, or in the form of, the builder. A hardening agent is a compound or<br>
system of compounds, organic or inorganic, which significantly contributes to the<br>
uniform solidification of the composition. Preferably, the hardening agents are<br>
compatible with the cleaning agent and other active ingrethents of the composition<br>
and are capable of providing an effective amount of hardness and/or aqueous<br>
solubility to the processed composition. The hardening agents should also be<br>
capable of forming a homogeneous matrix with the cleaning agent and other<br>
ingrethents when mixed and solidified to provide a uniform dissolution of the<br>
cleaning agent from the solid detergent composition during use.<br>
[0032]	The amount of hardening agent included in the solid detergent<br>
composition will vary according to factors including, but not limited to: the type of<br>
solid detergent composition being prepared, the ingrethents of the solid detergent<br>
 <br>
composition, the intended use of the composition, the quantity of dispensing<br>
solution applied to the solid composition over time during use, the temperature of<br>
the dispensing solution, the hardness of the dispensing solution, the physical size of<br>
the solid detergent composition, the concentration of the other ingrethents, and the<br>
concentration of the cleaning agent in the composition. It is preferred that the<br>
amount of the hardening agent included in the solid detergent composition is<br>
effective to combine with the cleaning agent and other ingrethents of the<br>
composition to form a homogeneous mixture under continuous mixing conditions<br>
and a temperature at or below the melting temperature of the hardening agent.<br>
[0033]	It is also preferred that the hardening agent form a matrix with the<br>
cleaning agent and other ingrethents which will harden to a solid form under<br>
ambient temperatures of approximately 30° C to approximately 50° C, particularly<br>
approximately 35° C to approximately 45° C, after mixing ceases and the mixture is<br>
dispensed from the mixing system, within approximately 1 minute to approximately<br>
3 hours, particularly approximately 2 minutes to approximately 2 hours, and<br>
particularly approximately 5 minutes to approximately 1 hour. A minimal amount<br>
of heat from an external source may be applied to the mixture to facilitate processing<br>
of the mixture. It is preferred that the amount of the hardening agent included in the<br>
solid detergent composition is effective to provide a desired hardness and desired<br>
rate of controlled solubility of the processed composition when placed in an aqueous<br>
medium to achieve a desired rate of dispensing the cleaning agent from the solidified<br>
composition during use.<br>
[0034]	The hardening agent may be an organic or an inorganic hardening<br>
agent. A preferred organic hardening agent is a polyethylene glycol (PEG)<br>
compound. The solidification rate of solid detergent compositions comprising a<br>
polyethylene glycol hardening agent will vary, at least in part, according to the<br>
amount and the molecular weight of the polyethylene glycol added to the<br>
composition. Examples of suitable polyethylene glycols include, but are not limited<br>
to: solid polyethylene glycols of the general formula H(OCH2CH2)nOH, where n is<br>
greater than 15, particularly approximately 30 to approximately 1700. Typically, the<br>
polyethylene glycol is a solid in the form of a free-flowing powder or flakes, having<br>
a molecular weight of approximately 1,000 to approximately 100,000, particularly<br>
 <br>
having a molecular weight of at least approximately 1,450 to approximately 20,000,<br>
more particularly between approximately 1,450 to approximately 8,000. The<br>
polyethylene glycol is present at a concentration of from approximately 1% to 75%<br>
by weight and particularly approximately 3% to approximately 15% by weight.<br>
Suitable polyethylene glycol compounds include, but are not limited to: PEG 4000,<br>
PEG 1450, and PEG 8000 among others, with PEG 4000 and PEG 8000 being most<br>
preferred. An example of a commercially available solid polyethylene glycol<br>
includes, but is not limited to: CARBOWAX, available from Union Carbide<br>
Corporation, Houston, TX.<br>
[0035]	Preferred inorganic hardening agents are hydratable inorganic salts,<br>
including, but not limited to: sulfates and bicarbonates. The inorganic hardening<br>
agents are present at concentrations of up to approximately 50% by weight,<br>
particularly approximately 5% to approximately 25% by weight, and more<br>
particularly approximately 5% to approximately 15% by weight.<br>
[0036]	Urea particles can also be employed as hardeners in the solid<br>
detergent compositions. The solidification rate of the compositions will vary, at<br>
least in part, to factors including, but not limited to: the amount, the particle size,<br>
and the shape of the urea added to the composition. For example, a particulate form<br>
of urea can be combined with a cleaning agent and other ingrethents, and preferably<br>
a minor but effective amount of water. The amount and particle size of the urea is<br>
effective to combine with the cleaning agent and other ingrethents to form a<br>
homogeneous mixture without the application of heat from an external source to<br>
melt the urea and other ingrethents to a molten stage. It is preferred that the amount<br>
of urea included in the solid detergent composition is effective to provide a desired<br>
hardness and desired rate of solubility of the composition when placed in an aqueous<br>
medium to achieve a desired rate of dispensing the cleaning agent from the solidified<br>
composition during use. In some embodiments, the composition includes between<br>
approximately 5% to approximately 90% by weight urea, particularly between<br>
approximately 8% and approximately 40% by weight urea, and more particularly<br>
between approximately 10% and approximately 30% by weight urea.<br>
[0037]	The urea may be in the form of prilled beads or powder. Prilled urea<br>
is generally available from commercial sources as a mixture of particle sizes ranging<br>
 <br>
from about 8-15 U.S. mesh, as for example, from Arcadian Sohio Company,<br>
Nitrogen Chemicals Division. A prilled form of urea is preferably milled to reduce<br>
the particle size to about 50 U.S. mesh to about 125 U.S. mesh, particularly about<br>
75-100 U.S. mesh, preferably using a wet mill such as a single or twin-screw<br>
extruder, a Teledyne mixer, a Ross emulsifier, and the like.<br>
Bleaching Agents<br>
[0038]	Bleaching agents suitable for use in the solid detergent composition<br>
for lightening or whitening a substrate include bleaching compounds capable of<br>
liberating an active halogen species, such as Cl2, Br2, -OCl- and/or -OBr-, under<br>
conditions typically encountered during the cleansing process. Suitable bleaching<br>
agents for use in the solid detergent compositions include, but are not limited to:<br>
chlorine-containing compounds such as chlorines, hypochlorites, or chloramines.<br>
Exemplary halogen-releasing compounds include, but are not limited to: the alkali<br>
metal dichloroisocyanurates, chlorinated trisodium phosphate, the alkali metal<br>
hypochlorites, monochloramine, and dichloramine. Encapsulated chlorine sources<br>
may also be used to enhance the stability of the chlorine source in the composition<br>
(see, for example, U.S. Patent Nos. 4,618,914 and 4,830,773, the disclosure of<br>
which is incorporated by reference herein). A bleaching agent may also be a<br>
peroxygen or active oxygen source such as hydrogen peroxide, perborates, sodium<br>
carbonate peroxyhydrate, potassium permonosulfate, and sodium perborate mono<br>
and tetrahydrate, with and without activators such as tetraacetylethylene diamine.<br>
When the concentrate includes a bleaching agent, it can be included in an amount of<br>
between approximately 0.1% and approximately 60% by weight, between<br>
approximately 1% and approximately 20% by weight, between approximately 3%<br>
and approximately 8% by weight, and between approximately 3% and<br>
approximately 6% by weight.<br>
Fillers<br>
[0039]	The solid detergent composition can include an effective amount of<br>
detergent fillers which do not perform as a cleaning agent per se, but cooperates with<br>
the cleaning agent to enhance the overall cleaning capacity of the composition.<br>
 <br>
Examples of detergent fillers suitable for use in the present cleaning compositions<br>
include, but are not limited to: sodium sulfate, sodium chloride, starch, and sugars.<br>
When the concentrate includes a detergent filler, it can be included in an amount up<br>
to approximately 50% by weight, between approximately 1% and approximately<br>
30% by weight, or between approximately 1.5% and approximately 25% by weight.<br>
Defoaming Agents<br>
[0040]	A defoaming agent for reducing the stability of foam may also be<br>
included in the warewashing composition. Examples of defoaming agents include,<br>
but are not limited to: ethylene oxide/propylene block copolymers such as those<br>
available under the name Pluronic N-3; silicone compounds such as silica dispersed<br>
in polydimethylsiloxane, polydimethylsiloxane, and functionalized<br>
polydimethylsiloxane such as those available under the name Abil B9952; fatty<br>
amides, hydrocarbon waxes, fatty acids, fatty esters, fatty alcohols, fatty acid soaps,<br>
ethoxylates, mineral oils, polyethylene glycol esters, and alkyl phosphate esters such<br>
as monostearyl phosphate. A discussion of defoaming agents may be found, for<br>
example, in U.S. Patent No. 3,048,548 to Martin et al., U.S. Patent No. 3,334,147 to<br>
Brunelle et al., and U.S. Patent No. 3,442,242 to Rue et al., the disclosures of which<br>
are incorporated herein by reference. When the concentrate includes a defoaming<br>
agent, the defoaming agent can be provided in an amount of between approximately<br>
0.0001% and approximately 10% by weight, between approximately 0.001% and<br>
approximately 5% by weight, or between approximately 0.01% and approximately<br>
1.0% by weight.<br>
Anti-Redeposition Agents<br>
[0041]	The solid detergent composition can include an anti-redeposition<br>
agent for facilitating sustained suspension of soils in a cleaning solution and<br>
preventing the removed soils from being redeposited onto the substrate being<br>
cleaned. Examples of suitable anti-redeposition agents include, but are not limited<br>
to: polyacrylates, styrene maleic anhydride copolymers, cellulosic derivatives such<br>
as hydroxyethyl cellulose, and hydroxypropyl cellulose. When the concentrate<br>
includes an anti-redeposition agent, the anti-redeposition agent can be included in an<br>
 <br>
amount of between approximately 0.5% and approximately 10% by weight, and<br>
between approximately 1% and approximately 5% by weight.<br>
Stabilizing Agents<br>
[0042]	The solid detergent composition may also include stabilizing agents.<br>
Examples of suitable stabilizing agents include, but are not limited to: borate,<br>
calcium/magnesium ions, propylene glycol, and mixtures thereof. The concentrate<br>
need not include a stabilizing agent, but when the concentrate includes a stabilizing<br>
agent, it can be included in an amount that provides the desired level of stability of<br>
the concentrate. Exemplary ranges of the stabilizing agent include up to<br>
approximately 20% by weight, between approximately 0.5% and approximately<br>
15% by weight, and between approximately 2% and approximately 10% by weight.<br>
Dispersants<br>
[0043]	The solid detergent composition may also include dispersants.<br>
Examples of suitable dispersants that can be used in the solid detergent composition<br>
include, but are not limited to: maleic acid/olefin copolymers, polyacrylic acid, and<br>
mixtures thereof. The concentrate need not include a dispersant, but when a<br>
dispersant is included it can be included in an amount that provides the desired<br>
dispersant properties. Exemplary ranges of the dispersant in the concentrate can be<br>
up to approximately 20% by weight, between approximately 0.5% and<br>
approximately 15% by weight, and between approximately 2% and approximately<br>
9% by weight.<br>
Enzymes<br>
[0044]	Enzymes that can be included in the solid detergent composition<br>
include those enzymes that aid in the removal of starch and/or protein stains.<br>
Exemplary types of enzymes include, but are not limited to: proteases, alpha-<br>
amylases, and mixtures thereof. Exemplary proteases that can be used include, but<br>
are not limited to: those derived from Bacillus licheniformix, Bacillus lenus,<br>
Bacillus alcalophilus, and Bacillus amyloliquefacins. Exemplary alpha-amylases<br>
include Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus amyloliquefaceins and Bacillus licheniformis.<br>
 <br>
The concentrate need not include an enzyme, but when the concentrate includes an<br>
enzyme, it can be included in an amount that provides the desired enzymatic activity<br>
when the solid detergent composition is provided as a use composition. Exemplary<br>
ranges of the enzyme in the concentrate include up to approximately 15% by weight,<br>
between approximately 0.5% to approximately 10% by weight, and between<br>
approximately 1% to approximately 5% by weight.<br>
Glass and Metal Corrosion Inhibitors<br>
[0045]	The solid detergent composition can include a metal corrosion<br>
inhibitor in an amount up to approximately 50% by weight, between approximately<br>
1% and approximately 40% by weight, or between approximately 3% and<br>
approximately 30% by weight. The corrosion inhibitor is included in the solid<br>
detergent composition in an amount sufficient to provide a use solution that exhibits<br>
a rate of corrosion and/or etching of glass that is less than the rate of corrosion<br>
and/or etching of glass for an otherwise identical use solution except for the absence<br>
of the corrosion inhibitor. It is expected that the use solution will include at least<br>
approximately 6 parts per million (ppm) of the corrosion inhibitor to provide desired<br>
corrosion inhibition properties. It is expected that larger amounts of corrosion<br>
inhibitor can be used in the use solution without deleterious effects. It is expected<br>
that at a certain point, the additive effect of increased corrosion and/or etching<br>
resistance with increasing corrosion inhibitor concentration will be lost, and<br>
additional corrosion inhibitor will simply increase the cost of using the solid<br>
detergent composition. The use solution can include between approximately 6 ppm<br>
and approximately 300 ppm of the corrosion inhibitor, and between approximately<br>
20 ppm and approximately 200 ppm of the corrosion inhibitor. Examples of suitable<br>
corrosion inhibitors include, but are not limited to: a combination of a source of<br>
aluminum ion and a source of zinc ion, as well as an alkaline metal silicate or<br>
hydrate thereof.<br>
[0046]	The corrosion inhibitor can refer to the combination of a source of<br>
aluminum ion and a source of zinc ion. The source of aluminum ion and the source<br>
of zinc ion provide aluminum ion and zinc ion, respectively, when the solid<br>
detergent composition is provided in the form of a use solution. The amount of the<br>
 <br>
corrosion inhibitor is calculated based upon the combined amount of the source of<br>
aluminum ion and the source of zinc ion. Anything that provides an aluminum ion<br>
in a use solution can be referred to as a source of aluminum ion, and anything that<br>
provides a zinc ion when provided in a use solution can be referred to as a source of<br>
zinc ion. It is not necessary for the source of aluminum ion and/or me source of zinc<br>
ion to react to form the aluminum ion and/or the zinc ion. Aluminum ions can be<br>
considered a source of aluminum ion, and zinc ions can be considered a source of<br>
zinc ion. The source of aluminum ion and the source of zinc ion can be provided as<br>
organic salts, inorganic salts, and mixtures thereof. Exemplary sources of aluminum<br>
ion include, but are not limited to: aluminum salts such as sodium aluminate,<br>
aluminum bromide, aluminum chlorate, aluminum chloride, aluminum iodide,<br>
aluminum nitrate, aluminum sulfate, aluminum acetate, aluminum formate,<br>
aluminum tartrate, aluminum lactate, aluminum oleate, aluminum bromate,<br>
aluminum borate, aluminum potassium sulfate, aluminum zinc sulfate, and<br>
aluminum phosphate. Exemplary sources of zinc ion include, but are not limited to:<br>
zinc salts such as zinc chloride, zinc sulfate, zinc nitrate, zinc iodide, zinc<br>
thiocyanate, zinc fluorosilicate, zinc dichromate, zinc chlorate, sodium zincate, zinc<br>
gluconate, zinc acetate, zinc benzoate, zinc citrate, zinc lactate, zinc formate, zinc<br>
bromate, zinc bromide, zinc fluoride, zinc fluorosilicate, and zinc salicylate.<br>
[0047]	The applicants discovered that by controlling the ratio of the<br>
aluminum ion to the zinc ion in the use solution, it is possible to provide reduced<br>
corrosion and/or etching of glassware and ceramics compared with the use of either<br>
component alone. That is, the combination of the aluminum ion and the zinc ion can<br>
provide a synergy in the reduction of corrosion and/or etching. The ratio of the<br>
source of aluminum ion to the source of zinc ion can be controlled to provide a<br>
synergistic effect. In general, the weight ratio of aluminum ion to zinc ion in the use<br>
solution can be between at least approximately 6:1, can be less than approximately<br>
1:20, and can be between approximately 2:1 and approximately 1:15.<br>
[0048]	An effective amount of an alkaline metal silicate or hydrate thereof<br>
can be employed in the compositions and processes of the invention to form a stable<br>
solid detergent composition having metal protecting capacity. The silicates<br>
employed in the compositions of the invention are those that have conventionally<br>
 <br>
been used in solid detergent formulations. For example, typical alkali metal silicates<br>
are those powdered, particulate or granular silicates which are either anhydrous or<br>
preferably which contain water of hydration (approximately 5% to approximately<br>
25% by weight, particularly approximately 15% to approximately 20% by weight<br>
water of hydration). These silicates are preferably sodium silicates and have a<br>
Na2O:SiO2 ratio of approximately 1:1 to approximately 1:5, respectively, and<br>
typically contain available water in the amount of from approximately 5% to<br>
approximately 25% by weight. In general, the silicates have a Na2O:SiO2 ratio of<br>
approximately 1:1 to approximately 1:3.75, particularly approximately 1:1.5 to<br>
approximately 1:3.75 and most particularly approximately 1:1.5 to approximately<br>
1:2.5. A silicate with a Na2O:SiO2 ratio of approximately 1:2 and approximately<br>
16% to approximately 22% by weight water of hydration, is most preferred. For<br>
example, such silicates are available in powder form as GD Silicate and in granular<br>
form as Britesil H-20, available from PQ Corporation, Valley Forge, PA. These<br>
ratios may be obtained with single silicate compositions or combinations of silicates<br>
which upon combination result in the preferred ratio. The hydrated silicates at<br>
preferred ratios, a Na2O:SiO2 ratio of approximately 1:1.5 to approximately 1:2.5,<br>
have been found to provide the optimum metal protection and rapidly form a solid<br>
detergent. Hydrated silicates are preferred.<br>
[0049]	Silicates can be included in the solid detergent composition to<br>
provide for metal protection but are additionally known to provide alkalinity and<br>
additionally function as anti-redeposition agents. Exemplary silicates include, but<br>
are not limited to: sodium silicate and potassium silicate. The solid detergent<br>
composition can be provided without silicates, but when silicates are included, they<br>
can be included in amounts that provide for desired metal protection. The<br>
concentrate can include silicates in amounts of at least approximately 1% by weight,<br>
at least approximately 5% by weight, at least approximately 10% by weight, and at<br>
least approximately 15% by weight. In addition, in order to provide sufficient room<br>
for other components in the concentrate, the silicate component can be provided at a<br>
level of less than approximately 35% by weight, less than approximately 25% by<br>
weight, less than approximately 20% by weight, and less than approximately 15%<br>
by weight.<br>
 <br>
Fragrances and Dyes<br>
[0050]	Various dyes, odorants including perfumes, and other aesthetic<br>
enhancing agents can also be included in the composition. Suitable dyes that may be<br>
included to alter the appearance of the composition, include, but are not limited to:<br>
Direct Blue 86, available from Mac Dye-Chem Industries, Ahmedabad, India;<br>
Fastusol Blue, available from Mobay Chemical Corporation, Pittsburgh, PA; Acid<br>
Orange 7, available from American Cyanamid Company, Wayne, NJ; Basic Violet<br>
10 and Sandolan Blue/Acid Blue 182, available from Sandoz, Princeton, NJ; Acid<br>
Yellow 23, available from Chemos GmbH, Regenstauf, Germany; Acid Yellow 17,<br>
available from Sigma Chemical, St. Louis, MO; Sap Green and Metanil Yellow,<br>
available from Keyston Analine and Chemical, Chicago, IL; Acid Blue 9, available<br>
from Emerald Hilton Davis, LLC, Cincinnati, OH; Hisol Fast Red and Fluorescein,<br>
available from Capitol Color and Chemical Company, Newark, NJ; and Acid Green<br>

[0051]	Fragrances or perfumes that may be included in the compositions<br>
include, but are not limited to: terpenoids such as citronellol, aldehydes such as amyl<br>
cinnamaldehyde, a jasmine such as CIS-jasmine or jasmal, and vanillin.<br>
Thickeners<br>
[0052]	The solid detergent compositions can include a rheology modifier or<br>
a thickener. The rheology modifier may provide the following functions: increasing<br>
the viscosity of the compositions; increasing the particle size of liquid use solutions<br>
when dispensed through a spray nozzle; providing the use solutions with vertical<br>
cling to surfaces; providing particle suspension within the use solutions; or reducing<br>
the evaporation rate of the use solutions.<br>
[0053]	The rheology modifier may provide a use composition that is pseudo<br>
plastic, in other words the use composition or material when left undisturbed (in a<br>
shear mode), retains a high viscosity. However, when sheared, the viscosity of the<br>
material is substantially but reversibly reduced. After the shear action is removed,<br>
the viscosity returns. These properties permit the application of the material through<br>
a spray head. When sprayed through a nozzle, the material undergoes shear as it is<br>
 <br>
drawn up a feed tube into a spray head under the influence of pressure and is sheared<br>
by the action of a pump in a pump action sprayer. In either case, the viscosity can<br>
drop to a point such that substantial quantities of the material can be applied using<br>
the spray devices used to apply the material to a soiled surface. However, once the<br>
material comes to rest on a soiled surface, the materials can regain high viscosity to<br>
ensure that the material remains in place on the soil. Preferably, the material can be<br>
applied to a surface resulting in a substantial coating of the material that provides the<br>
cleaning components in sufficient concentration to result in lifting and removal of<br>
the hardened or baked-on soil. While in contact with the soil on vertical or inclined<br>
surfaces, the thickeners in conjunction with the other components of the cleaner<br>
minimize dripping, sagging, slumping or other movement of the material under the<br>
effects of gravity. The material should be formulated such that the viscosity of the<br>
material is adequate to maintain contact between substantial quantities of the film of<br>
the material with the soil for at least a minute, particularly five minutes or more.<br>
[0054]	Examples of suitable thickeners or rheology modifiers are polymeric<br>
thickeners including, but not limited to: polymers or natural polymers or gums<br>
derived from plant or animal sources. Such materials may be polysaccharides such<br>
as large polysaccharide molecules having substantial thickening capacity.<br>
Thickeners or rheology modifiers also include clays.<br>
[0055]	A substantially soluble polymeric thickener can be used to provide<br>
increased viscosity or increased conductivity to the use compositions. Examples of<br>
polymeric thickeners for the aqueous compositions of the invention include, but are<br>
not limited to: carboxylated vinyl polymers such as polyacrylic acids and sodium<br>
salts thereof, ethoxylated cellulose, polyacrylamide thickeners, cross-linked, xanthan<br>
compositions, sodium alginate and algin products, hydroxypropyl cellulose,<br>
hydroxyethyl cellulose, and other similar aqueous thickeners mat have some<br>
substantial proportion of water solubility. Examples of suitable commercially<br>
available thickeners include, but are not limited to: Acusol, available from Rohm &amp;<br>
Haas Company, Philadelphia, PA; and Carbopol, available from B.F. Goodrich,<br>
Charlotte, NC.<br>
[0056]	Examples of suitable polymeric thickeners include, but not limited to:<br>
polysaccharides. An example of a suitable commercially available polysaccharide<br>
 <br>
includes, but is not limited to, Diutan, available from Kelco Division of Merck, San<br>
thego, CA. Thickeners for use in the solid detergent compositions further include<br>
polyvinyl alcohol thickeners, such as, fully hydrolyzed (greater than 98.5 mol<br>
acetate replaced with the -OH function).<br>
[0057]	An example of a particularly suitable polysaccharide includes, but is<br>
not limited to, xanthans. Such xanthan polymers are preferred due to their high<br>
water solubility, and great thickening power. Xanthan is an extracellular<br>
polysaccharide of xanthomonas campestras. Xanthan may be made by fermentation<br>
based on corn sugar or other corn sweetener by-products. Xanthan comprises a poly<br>
beta-(l-4)-D-Glucopyranosyl backbone chain, similar to that found in cellulose.<br>
Aqueous dispersions of xanthan gum and its derivatives exhibit novel and<br>
remarkable rheological properties. Low concentrations of the gum have relatively<br>
high viscosities which permit it to be used economically. Xanthan gum solutions<br>
exhibit high pseudo plasticity, i.e. over a wide range of concentrations, rapid shear<br>
thinning occurs that is generally understood to be instantaneously reversible. Non-<br>
sheared materials have viscosities that appear to be independent of the pH and<br>
independent of temperature over wide ranges. Preferred xanthan materials include<br>
crosslinked xanthan materials. Xanthan polymers can be crosslinked with a variety<br>
of known covalent reacting crosslinking agents reactive with the hydroxyl<br>
functionality of large polysaccharide molecules and can also be crosslinked using<br>
divalent, trivalent or polyvalent metal ions. Such crosslinked xanthan gels are<br>
disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,782,901, which is herein incorporated by reference.<br>
Suitable crosslinking agents for xanthan materials include, but are not limited to:<br>
metal cations such as A1+3, Fe+3, Sb+3, Zr+4 and other transition metals.<br>
Examples of suitable commercially available xanthans include, but are not limited<br>
to: KELTROL®, KELZAN® AR, KELZAN® D35, KELZAN® S, KELZAN® XZ,<br>
available from Kelco Division of Merck, San thego, CA. Known organic<br>
crosslinking agents can also be used. A preferred crosslinked xanthan is KELZAN®<br>
AR, which provides a pseudo plastic use solution that can produce large particle size<br>
mist or aerosol when sprayed.<br>
Methods of Use<br>
 <br>
[0058]	In general, a solid detergent composition using the solidification<br>
matrix of the present invention can be created by combining a salt of a straight chain<br>
saturated mono-, di-, or tri- carboxylic acid, sodium carbonate, water, and any<br>
additional functional components and allowing the components to interact and<br>
solidify. For example, in a first embodiment, the solid detergent composition may<br>
include a salt of a straight chain saturated mono-, di-, or tri- carboxylic acid, water,<br>
builder, sodium carbonate, and surfactant. In an exemplary embodiment, the solid<br>
detergent composition includes between about 1% and about 15% straight chain<br>
saturated mono-, di-, or tri- carboxylic acid salt by weight and particularly between<br>
about 1% and about 10% straight chain saturated mono-, di-, or tri- carboxylic acid<br>
salt by weight. In another exemplary embodiment, the solid detergent composition<br>
includes between about 2% and about 50% water by weight and particularly<br>
between about 5% and about 40% water by weight. In another exemplary<br>
embodiment, the solid detergent composition includes less than about 40% builder<br>
by weight and particularly less than about 30% builder by weight. In another<br>
exemplary embodiment, the solid detergent composition includes between about<br>
20% and about 70% sodium carbonate by weight and particularly between about<br>
45% and about 65% sodium carbonate by weight. In another exemplary<br>
embodiment, the solid detergent composition includes between about 0.5% and<br>
about 10% surfactant by weight and particularly between about 1% and about 5%<br>
surfactant by weight.<br>
[0059]	In some embodiments, the relative amounts of water and straight<br>
chain saturated mono-, di-, or tri- carboxylic acid salt are controlled within a<br>
composition. The solidification matrix and additional functional components harden<br>
into solid form due to me chemical reaction of the sodium carbonate with the water.<br>
As the solidification matrix solidifies, a binder composition can form to bind and<br>
solidify the components. At least a portion of the ingrethents associate to form the<br>
binder while the balance of the ingrethents forms the remainder of the solid<br>
composition. The solidification process may last from a few minutes to about six<br>
hours, depending on factors including, but not limited to: the size of the formed or<br>
cast composition, the ingrethents of the composition, and the temperature of the<br>
composition.<br>
 <br>
[0060]	Solid detergent compositions formed using the solidification matrix<br>
are produced using a batch or continuous mixing system. In an exemplary<br>
embodiment, a single- or twin-screw extruder is used to combine and mix one or<br>
more cleaning agents at high shear to form a homogeneous mixture. In some<br>
embodiments, the processing temperature is at or below the melting temperature of<br>
the components. The processed mixture may be dispensed from the mixer by<br>
forming, casting or other suitable means, whereupon me detergent composition<br>
hardens to a solid form. The structure of the matrix may be characterized according<br>
to its hardness, melting point, material distribution, crystal structure, and other like<br>
properties according to known methods in the art. Generally, a solid detergent<br>
composition processed according to the method of the invention is substantially<br>
homogeneous with regard to the distribution of ingrethents throughout its mass and<br>
is dimensionally stable.<br>
[0061]	Specifically, in a forming process, the liquid and solid components<br>
are introduced into the final mixing system and are continuously mixed until the<br>
components form a substantially homogeneous semi-solid mixture in which the<br>
components are distributed throughout its mass. In an exemplary embodiment, the<br>
components are mixed in the mixing system for at least approximately 5 seconds.<br>
The mixture is then discharged from the mixing system into, or through, a the or<br>
other shaping means. The product is then packaged. In an exemplary embodiment,<br>
the formed composition begins to harden to a solid form in between approximately 1<br>
minute and approximately 3 hours. Particularly, the formed composition begins to<br>
harden to a solid form in between approximately 1 minute and approximately 2<br>
hours. More particularly, the formed composition begins to harden to a solid form<br>
in between approximately 1 minute and approximately 20 minutes.<br>
[0062]	Specifically, in a casting process, the liquid and solid components are<br>
introduced into the final mixing system and are continuously mixed until the<br>
components form a substantially homogeneous liquid mixture in which the<br>
components are distributed throughout its mass. In an exemplary embodiment, the<br>
components are mixed in the mixing system for at least approximately 60 seconds.<br>
Once the mixing is complete, the product is transferred to a packaging container<br>
where solidification takes place. In an exemplary embodiment, the cast composition<br>
 <br>
begins to harden to a solid form in between approximately 1 minute and<br>
approximately 3 hours. Particularly, the cast composition begins to harden to a solid<br>
form in between approximately 1 minute and approximately 2 hours. More<br>
particularly, the cast composition begins to harden to a solid form in between<br>
approximately 1 minute and approximately 20 minutes.<br>
[0063]	By the term "solid form", it is meant that the hardened composition<br>
will not flow and will substantially retain its shape under moderate stress or pressure<br>
or mere gravity. The degree of hardness of the solid cast composition may range<br>
from mat of a fused solid product which is relatively dense and hard, for example,<br>
like concrete, to a consistency characterized as being a hardened paste. In addition,<br>
the term "solid" refers to the state of the detergent composition under the expected<br>
conditions of storage and use of the solid detergent composition. In general, it is<br>
expected that the detergent composition will remain in solid form when exposed to<br>
temperatures of up to approximately 100 °F and particularly greater than<br>
approximately 120°F.<br>
[0064]	The resulting solid detergent composition may take forms including,<br>
but not limited to: a cast solid product; an extruded, molded or formed solid pellet,<br>
block, tablet, powder, granule, flake; or the formed solid can thereafter be ground or<br>
formed into a powder, granule, or flake. In an exemplary embodiment, extruded<br>
pellet materials formed by the solidification matrix have a weight of between<br>
approximately 50 grams and approximately 250 grams, extruded solids formed by<br>
the solidification matrix have a weight of approximately 100 grams or greater, and<br>
solid block detergents formed by the solidification matrix have a mass of between<br>
approximately 1 and approximately 10 kilograms. The solid compositions provide<br>
for a stabilized source of functional materials. In some embodiments, the solid<br>
composition may be dissolved, for example, in an aqueous or other medium, to<br>
create a concentrated and/or use solution. The solution may be directed to a storage<br>
reservoir for later use and/or dilution, or may be applied directly to a point of use.<br>
[0065]	In certain embodiments, the solid detergent composition is provided<br>
in the form of a unit dose. A unit dose refers to a solid detergent composition unit<br>
sized so that the entire unit is used during a single washing cycle. When the solid<br>
detergent composition is provided as a unit dose, it is typically provided as a cast<br>
 <br>
solid, an extruded pellet, or a tablet having a size of between approximately 1 gram<br>
and approximately 50 grams.<br>
[0066]	In other embodiments, the solid detergent composition is provided in<br>
the form of a multiple-use solid, such as a block or a plurality of pellets, and can be<br>
repeatedly used to generate aqueous detergent compositions for multiple washing<br>
cycles. In certain embodiments, the solid detergent composition is provided as a<br>
cast solid, an extruded block, or a tablet having a mass of between approximately 5<br>
grams and approximately 10 kilograms. In certain embodiments, a multiple-use<br>
form of the solid detergent composition has a mass between approximately 1<br>
kilogram and approximately 10 kilograms. In further embodiments, a multiple-use<br>
form of the solid detergent composition has a mass of between approximately 5<br>
kilograms and about approximately 8 kilograms. In other embodiments, a multiple-<br>
use form of the solid detergent composition has a mass of between about<br>
approximately 5 grams and approximately 1 kilogram, or between approximately 5<br>
grams and approximately 500 grams.<br>
[0067]	Although the detergent composition is discussed as being formed into<br>
a solid product, the detergent composition may also be provided in the form of a<br>
paste. When the concentrate is provided in the form of a paste, enough water is<br>
added to the detergent composition such that complete solidification of the detergent<br>
composition is precluded. In addition, dispersants and other components may be<br>
incorporated into the detergent composition in order to maintain a desired<br>
distribution of components.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
[0068]	The present invention is more particularly described in the following<br>
examples that are intended as illustrations only, since numerous modifications and<br>
variations within the scope of the present invention will be apparent to those skilled<br>
in the art. Unless otherwise noted, all parts, percentages, and ratios reported in the<br>
following examples are on a weight basis, and all reagents used in the examples<br>
were obtained, or are available, from the chemical suppliers described below, or may<br>
be synthesized by conventional techniques.<br>
 <br>
[0069]	The following test method was used to characterize the compositions<br>
produced in Examples 1, 2, and 3 and Comparative Example A:<br>
Dimensional Stability Test for Formed Products<br>
[0070]	Approximately 50 grams batch of the product using a straight chain<br>
saturated mono-, di-, or tri- carboxylic acid salt as part of the solidification matrix<br>
was first pressed in a the at approximately 1000 pounds per square inch (psi) for<br>
approximately 20 seconds to form tablets. The diameter and height of the tablets<br>
were measured and recorded. The tablets were maintained at room temperature for<br>
one day and then placed in an oven at a temperature of approximately 120 °F. After<br>
the tablets were removed from the oven, the diameters and heights of the tablets<br>
were measured and recorded. The tablets were considered to exhibit dimensional<br>
stability if there was less than approximately 2% swelling, or growth.<br>
Examples 1, 2, and 3 and Comparative Example A<br>
[0071]	Examples 1, 2, and 3 are compositions of the present invention using<br>
a straight chain saturated mono-, di-, or tri- carboxylic acid salt as part of a<br>
solidification matrix. In particular, the compositions of Examples 1, 2, and 3 used<br>
sodium citrate dihydrate, sodium tartrate dihydrate, and sodium acetate, respectively,<br>
as part of the solidification matrix. In addition, the compositions of Examples 1-3<br>
also included component concentrations (in weight percent) of sodium carbonate<br>
(soda ash or dense ash), sodium bicarbonate, anhydrous metasilicate, a builder, and<br>
surfactants as provided in Table 1. The sodium carbonate, sodium bicarbonate,<br>
anhydrous metasilicate, sodium citrate dihydrate, copolymer, and surfactants were<br>
premixed to form a powder premix and the straight chain saturated mono-, di-, or tri-<br>
carboxylic acid salt and water were premixed to form a liquid premix. The powder<br>
premix and the liquid premix were then mixed together to form the composition.<br>
Approximately 50 grams of the composition were pressed into a tablet at<br>
approximately 1000 psi for approximately 20 seconds.<br>
[0072]	The composition of Comparative Example A was prepared as in<br>
Examples 1, 2, and 3, except that the composition of Comparative Example A did<br>
not include a straight chain saturated mono-, di-, or tri- carboxylic acid salt.<br>
 <br>
[0073]	Table 1 provides the component concentrations for the compositions<br>
of Example 1, Example 2, Example 3, and Comparative Example A.<br>
 <br>
[0074]	The compositions of Examples 1, 2, and 3 and Comparative Example<br>
A were then subjected to the dimensional stability test for formed products, as<br>
discussed above, to observe the dimensional stability of the compositions after<br>
heating. The results are tabulated below in Table 2.<br>
 <br>
[0075]	As illustrated in Table 2, the formed products of the compositions of<br>
Examples 1, 2, and 3 exhibited considerably less swelling than the formed product<br>
of the composition of Comparative Example A. In particular, the product of the<br>
composition of Example 1 had only a 0.3% growth in diameter and a 0.1% growth in<br>
height, the product of the composition of Example 2 only had a 0.4% growth in<br>
diameter and a 0.1 % growth in height, and the product of the composition of<br>
 <br>
Example 3 only had a 0.1% growth in diameter and a 0.4% growth in height. By<br>
comparison, the product of the composition of Comparative Example A had a 2.7%<br>
growth in diameter and an 8.2% growth in height.<br>
[0076]	The only difference in the compositions of Examples 1, 2, and 3 and<br>
Comparative Example A was the presence of a straight chain saturated mono-, di-,<br>
or tri- carboxylic acid salt. It is thus believed that the straight chain saturated mono-,<br>
di-, or tri- carboxylic acid salt aided in the dimensional stability of the products of<br>
the compositions of Example 1, Example 2, and Example 3. By controlling the<br>
migration of water and acting as a donor or acceptor of free water, the straight chain<br>
saturated mono-, di-, or tri- carboxylic acid salt may have allowed processing and<br>
prevented the formed products from swelling when the products were subjected to<br>
heat as well as controlled the rate of solidification of the product within the desired<br>
range. Because the composition of Comparative Example A did not contain a<br>
straight chain saturated mono-, di-, or tri- carboxylic acid salt, the composition did<br>
not include a mechanism for controlling the movement of water within the solid<br>
product. The composition of Comparative Example A would not be suitable for<br>
processing and failed the test for dimensional stability.<br>
[0077]	The following test method was used to characterize the compositions<br>
produced in Examples 4, 5, and 6 and Comparative Example B:<br>
Dimensional Stability Test for Cast Products<br>
[0078]	Approximately 4000 grams batch of the product using a straight<br>
chain saturated mono-, di-, or tri- carboxylic acid salt as part of the solidification<br>
matrix was first poured into a capsule. The diameter of the capsule was measured<br>
and recorded. The capsule was maintained at room temperature for one day, held in<br>
an oven at a temperature of approximately 104 °F for two days, and then returned to<br>
room temperature. After the capsule returned to room temperature, the diameter of<br>
the capsule was measured and recorded. The capsule was considered to exhibit<br>
dimensional stability if there was less than approximately 2% swelling, or growth.<br>
Examples 4, 5, and 6 and Comparative Example B<br>
 <br>
[0079]	Examples 4, 5, and 6 are compositions of the present invention using<br>
a straight chain saturated mono-, di-, or txi- carboxylic acid salt as a part of the<br>
solidification matrix. In particular, the composition of Example 4 used sodium<br>
citrate dihydrate as part of the solidification matrix, the composition of Example 5<br>
used sodium tartrate dihydrate as part of the solidification matrix, and the<br>
composition of Example 6 used sodium acetate as part of the solidification matrix.<br>
Each of the compositions of Examples 4-6 also included component concentrations<br>
(in weight percent) of softened water, aminocarboxylate, sodium polyacrylate,<br>
sodium hydroxide 50%, sodium carbonate (dense ash), anionic surfactant, and<br>
nonionic surfactant, as provided in Table 3. The liquids (softened water,<br>
aminocarboxylate, straight chain saturated mono-, di-, or tri- carboxylic acid salt,<br>
polyacrylate, and sodium hydroxide 50%) were premixed in order to form a liquid<br>
premix and the powders (sodium carbonate, anionic surfactant, and nonionic<br>
surfactant) were premixed in order to form a powder premix. The liquid premix and<br>
the powder premix were then mixed to form the composition, which was<br>
subsequently poured into capsules.<br>
[0080]	The composition of Comparative Example B was prepared as in<br>
Examples 4, 5, and 6 except that the composition of Comparative Example B did not<br>
contain a straight chain saturated mono-, di-, or tri- carboxylic acid salt but did<br>
contain the same quantity of available water.<br>
[0081]	Table 3 provides the component concentrations for the compositions<br>
of Examples 4-6 and Comparative Example B.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
[0082]	After the compositions of Example 4-6 and Comparative Example B<br>
were formed, they were subjected to the dimensional stability test for cast products,<br>
as discussed above, to observe the dimensional stability of the compositions after<br>
heating. The results are tabulated below in Table 4.<br>
 <br>
[0083]	As illustrated in Table 4, the cast products of the compositions of<br>
Example 4-6 exhibited considerably less swelling than the cast product of the<br>
composition of Comparative Example B. In particular, the product of the<br>
composition of Example 4 experienced only a 1.2% growth in diameter, the product<br>
of the composition of Example 5 experienced only a 0.6% growth in diameter, and<br>
the product of the composition of Example 6 experienced only a 1.2% growth in<br>
diameter. By comparison, the product of the composition of Comparative Example<br>
B had a 4.9% growth in diameter.<br>
[0084]	The only difference in the compositions of Examples 4-6 and<br>
Comparative Example B was the presence of a straight chain saturated mono-, di-, or<br>
tri- carboxylic acid salt. It is thus believed that the straight chain saturated mono-,<br>
di-, or tri- carboxylic acid salt aided in the dimensional stability of the products of<br>
the compositions of Examples 4-6. By controlling the migration of water and acting<br>
as a donor or acceptor of free water, the straight chain saturated mono-, di-, or tri-<br>
carboxylic acid salt may have allowed processing and prevented the cast product<br>
from swelling when the product was subjected to heat as well as controlled the rate<br>
of solidification of the product within the desired range. By contrast, because the<br>
composition of Comparative Example B did not contain a straight chain saturated<br>
mono-, di-, or tri- carboxylic acid salt, the composition did not contain a mechanism<br>
for controlling the movement of water within the solid product. The composition of<br>
Comparative Example B failed the test for dimensional stability and would not be<br>
suitable for manufacture.<br>
 <br>
[0085]	Although the present invention has been described with reference to<br>
preferred embodiments, workers skilled in the art will recognize that changes may<br>
be made in form and detail without departing from the spirit and scope of the<br>
invention.<br>
