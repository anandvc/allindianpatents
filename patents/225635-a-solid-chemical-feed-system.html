				<td>DUAL SOLID CHEMICAL FEED SYSTEM <br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION; <br>
 This invention relates generally to a method of feeding solid chemical food system and,<br>
 more particularly, <br>
to a dual solid chemical feed method which incorporates an automated capability for<br>
switching liquid solution containing dissolved solid chemicals from one feed bowl to another<br>
when one of the bowls is empty.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE RELATED TECHNOLOGY:<br>
The utilization of automatic, solid chemical feed dispensers to dispense chemicals<br>
used in industrial and cleaning processes is well known in the art. For industrial applications,<br>
such dispenser mechanisms are commonly used to add chemicals to boiler systems or to<br>
cooling towers to minimize and/or inhibit corrosion. Automatic dispensers were developed<br>
to minimize or eliminate the manual care and attention required to periodically add chemicals<br>
to a tank containing the liquid solution. Automatic dispensers are generally placed into two<br>
broad categories depending upon the method of controlling the amount of chemicals to be<br>
dispensed: (1) time-controlled dispensers; (2) conductivity measurement dispensers.<br>
One example of a method of dispensing a solution that is controlled by conductivity<br>
measurements is described in U.S. Patent No. 4,858,449 issued to Lehn. Lehn discloses an<br>
automatic dispenser for dispensing solid chemicals used preferably in cleaning processes.<br>
Lehn discloses a dispenser wherein a container holds a quantity of dissolvable solid<br>
chemicals which is sprayed with water under pressure to dissolve the chemicals which are<br>
ultimately dispensed. The quantity of chemicals dispensed is controlled by measuring the<br>
conductivity of the chemical solution.<br>
While automated dispensers have been effective in reducing the amount of manual<br>
attention required in maintaining such systems, problems may occurwhen the chemical in the<br>
dispenser contaiaerb exhausted. When thesolidchemical inthefoodcontainer is<br>
completely dissolved, the empty container must be manuly replaced by a new container<br>
filled with a new supply of solid chemicals. If the product is exhausted while the system is<br>
unattended, there is potential for the interruption in the chemical treatment of the system.<br>
This could occur over a period of hours, or potentially several days, fix example, during<br>
weekends during which treatment chemicals would not be added to the system. The feed<br>
solution created by the dissolution of the solid chemical would not be replenished and would<br>
be quickly diluted by the addition of water which is used to maintain a constant level in the<br>
dissolution chamber of automatic dispensers. The loss of treatment could result in corrosion<br>
and/or deposition of contaminants in a cooling or boiler system, or serious deterioration in the<br>
treatment program performance in any system using the automatic solid feed dispenser.<br>
Accordingly, improvements in automatic solid chemical feed or dispenser system is<br>
desirable to prevent the loss of chemical treatments which may result in serious damage in<br>
industrial systems or the like requiring continuous chemical treatment<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION:<br>
In accordance with a preferred arrangement of the invention, a solid chemical feed<br>
system comprises at least two feed bowls, each containing a quantity of solid chemicals that<br>
dissolve upon immersion in liquid to form a liquid solution. A sump is provided for<br>
receiving liquid solution from each feed bowl, and for containing such liquid solution at a<br>
predetermined level. A valve system is coupled to the feed bowls for separately controlling<br>
the introduction of liquid to the solid chemicals in each feed bowl. A sensor is supported by<br>
the sump in communication with the contained liquid solution for sensing a given,<br>
preselected property of the liquid solution, and for generating a signal in response to the<br>
detection of such property. A control unit is responsive to such signal for controlling the<br>
valve system to alternatingly switch the introduction of liquid from one feed bowl to the<br>
other.<br>
In a particular aspect of the invention, there is provided a dual solid chemical feed<br>
system comprising two feed bowls, each of which contains a quantity of solid chemicals that<br>
dissolve upon immersion in water to form a liquid solution. A source for supplying water to<br>
each bowl is provided. A first valve is coupled to the water source for controlling the supply<br>
of water to one of said bowls. The first valve is normally maintained in an open position to<br>
allow flow of water to one of the bowls. A second valve is coupled to the water source for<br>
controlling a supply of water to the other of the bowls. The second valve is maintained in a<br>
normally closed position to prevent flow of water to the other bowl. A sump for receiving<br>
liquid solution from each of the bowls and for containing liquid solution therein at a<br>
predetermined level is provided. A sensor is supported by the sump in communication with<br>
liquid solution for sensing the conductivity of the liquid solution and for generating a signal<br>
at a predetermined conductivity of the liquid solution. A control unit is responsive to the<br>
signal for closing the first valve, thereby preventing flow of water to one of the bowls and for<br>
opening the second valve, thereby allowing flow of water to the other of the bowls.<br>
In a further particular aspect of the invention, the feed system includes a third valve<br>
coupled to the water source for controlling the introduction of water into the sump. In yet<br>
another aspect of the invention, the control unit comprises a time controller for delaying the<br>
activation of the first valve and the second valve for a certain period of time after the sensor<br>
senses the predetermined conductivity of a liquid solution.<br>
In yet a further particular aspect of the invention, an apparatus is provided for<br>
controlling the conductivity of liquid solution in a solid chemical feed system that supplies<br>
liquid solution containing dissolved chemicals. The apparatus includes at least one feed bowl<br>
containing a quantity of solid chemicals that dissolve upon immersion in water to form a<br>
liquid solution. A sump is included for receiving the liquid solution from such at least one<br>
bowl and for containing the liquid solution therein at a predetermined level. A water source<br>
is provided and a first valve is coupled to the water source for controlling the supply of water<br>
to such at least one bowl. A second valve is coupled to the water source for controlling the<br>
supply of water to the sump. A sensor is provided in the sump in communication with the<br>
liquid solution for sensing the conductivity of the liquid solution, and for generating a signal<br>
at a predetermined conductivity of the liquid solution. A control unit is included which is<br>
responsive to the sensor signal for opening the first valve and closing the second valve to<br>
thereby supply water to the feed bowl when the conductivity is below the predetermined<br>
conductivity, and for closing the first valve and opening the second valve to thereby supply<br>
water to the sump when the conductivity is above the predetermined conductivity. The<br>
apparatus for controlling the conductivity of the liquid solution is also used in a solid<br>
chemical feed system comprising two or more feed bowls. When the chemicals in one of the<br>
feed bowls is depleted, the control unit may alternatively switch between supplying fresh<br>
water directly from the water source to the sump or through the one bowl wherein the<br>
chemicals are depleted to lower the conductivity of the liquid solution in the sump.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING:<br>
Figure 1, which is the sole drawing figure, is a schematic representation of the dual<br>
solid chemical feed system of the present invention.<br>
By reference now to the drawing, there is shown in Figure 1 a schematic<br>
representation of a dual solid chemical feed dispenser system 10 in accordance with a<br>
preferred arrangement thereof. Feed system 10 has particular application for applying<br>
chemical treatment to boilers and cooling towers in industrial processes, although the<br>
invention may be used to dispense desirable liquid solutions from the solid chemical feed<br>
dispensing system for other suitable applications. It should be further understood that the<br>
feed system 10 may be employed as a self-sustaining unit that may be used in industrial or<br>
other applications as a separable module that may be connected and disconnected to those<br>
systems requiring chemical treatment<br>
Feed system 10 comprises a sump 12 that receives and contains therewithin a quantity<br>
 of liquid solution 13, containing a desired chemical mix for use in treating equipment in<br>
industrial processes or the like. Two dispenser feed bowls 14 and 16 are in liquid<br>
communication with sump 12 through drains 18 and 20. Feed bowls 14 and 16 are preferably<br>
of the type that are used for controlling the quantity of chemicals dispensed therein by<br>
measuring the conductivity of the chemical solution. Such feed bowls are more folly<br>
described in U.S. Patent No. 4,858,449 issued to Lehn, and are incorporated herein by<br>
reference for all purposes.<br>
Each feed bowl 14,16 is provided to contain a quantity of solid chemicals chosen for<br>
a particular application. Such solid chemicals are typically in solid, powder or granular form,<br>
and are soluble in liquid such as water. Granulated sulfites may be used, for example, for<br>
treating boilers or cooling towers for the removal of oxygen to inhibit corrosion. Such solid<br>
chemicals are generally readily commercially available.<br>
A spray nozzle 22 and 24 is disposed within each of the respective bowls 14 and 16 to<br>
direct a spray of water under pressure to the chemicals contained within bowls 14 and 16 to<br>
dissolve chemicals contained therewithin, as will be described. Upon supply of pressurized<br>
water to solid chemicals contained within feed bowls 14,16 through spray nozzles 22,24, the<br>
solid chemicals are suitably dissolved to form a liquid solution and are fed either by gravity<br>
or suitable pressure through drains 18,20 to fill the sump 12 with a suitable amount of liquid<br>
solution 13.<br>
System 10 is suitably connected to an external water supply (not shown) to provide a<br>
water source 26 for the system 10. Water supplied through the water source 26 is piped<br>
through a gate valve 28, a strainer 30, a double check valve 32 and a pressure regulator 34.<br>
Gate valve 28 is used to isolate the system 10 from the main water supply and may be turned<br>
off to allow maintenance of the system. Strainer 30 is used to prevent particles such as salt<br>
crystals or rust from entering the system, and thereby prevents spray nozzles from getting<br>
undesirably plugged. Double check valve 32 is provided to prevent backflow of water.<br>
Pressure regulator 32 is used to adjust the pressure to a constant pressure, for example, 30<br>
psig, to maintain constant water flow rate and spray patterns in the bottom of the sump, as<br>
will be described. A suitable pressure gauge 36 is provided to measure the water pressure in<br>
the system 10.<br>
Pressurized water flow in the water source 26 is supplied through a pipe 38 to a t-<br>
fitting 40 which diverts the pressurized water flow into two directions, namely through pipes<br>
42 and 44. Pressurized water supplied through pipe 42 is fed through a solenoid activated<br>
valve 46 which regulates the flow of water through pipe 48 into the sump 12. Disposed at the<br>
terminal end of pipe 48 within sump 12, and located adjacent the bottom floor 12a of sump<br>
12, is a manifold 50 comprising a plurality of spray jets 52. While three spray jets 52 are<br>
shown, it should be appreciated that any number of jets may be employed. Water piped<br>
through pipe 48 and through manifold 50 is used to fill the sump 12 to a suitable level as will<br>
be described. Spray jets 52 are also provided so that the liquid solution contained within<br>
sump 12 may be agitated so that particles of solid chemicals that may be deposited on the<br>
bottom floor 12a of sump 12 may be periodically circulated in the liquid solution 13 for<br>
mixing purposes.<br>
Pressurized water flowing through pipe 44 is supplied to feed bowls 14 and 16<br>
through solenoid activated valves 54 and 56, respectively. Pressurized water is supplied<br>
through valve 54 to bowl 14 through pipe 58, spray nozzle 22 being disposed at the end of<br>
pipe 58. Pressurized water is supplied through valve 56 to feed bowl 16 through pipe 60,<br>
with spray nozzle 24 being disposed at the terminal end of pipe 60.<br>
Supported by sump 12 is an upper level switch 62 and a lower level switch 64. Upper<br>
level switch 62 is provided to serve as an alarm or shutdown device. Should the liquid<br>
solution 13 contained within sump 12 rise to the level of upper switch 62, a signal is sent<br>
through circuit 66 to a control box 68 indicating that the sump 12 is full and valves 46,54 and<br>
56 are closed, thereby preventing any further supply of water to the sump 12 or bowls 14 and<br>
16. Lower level switch 64 is disposed in the sump 12 in a manner to determine when the<br>
level of liquid solution 13 falls below a certain level. At such time when the liquid solution<br>
13 falls below the predetermined level, a signal is sent through circuit 70 to the control box<br>
68 to open valve 46 to thereby allow the flow of water through pipe 48 into the sump 12<br>
through the jets 52 in manifold 50. The level of the liquid solution 13 may also be increased<br>
by opening valve 54 to allow water to flow through pipe 58 into the sump 12 through nozzle<br>
22 in bowl 14 through drain 18 or by opening valve 56 to allow water to flow through pipe 60<br>
into sump 12 through nozzle 24 in bowl 16 through drain 20.<br>
Disposed in the sump for suitable communication with liquid solution 13, and below<br>
the level of the lower level switch 64, is a sensor 72. Sensor 72, in the preferred arrangement,<br>
is of the type used to measure the conductivity of the liquid solution 13. The sensor is set to<br>
have a selected set point that generates a signal indicative of the conductivity of the liquid<br>
solution 13. The set point is selected to be sufficiently greater than the conductivity of clean<br>
water supplied to sump 12 through line 48 and the conductivity of the solution being fed to<br>
sump 12 through drains 18 and 20 from the feed bowls 14 and 16. For example, if the<br>
conductivity readings obtained from the liquid solution being fed through drains 18 and 20 is<br>
mhos mhos<br>
on the order of 12,000 to 15,000 umhos, a set point reading of 10,000-umhos would be<br>
acceptable for that particular application. It should be appreciated that other set points may<br>
be selected, depending upon the chemicals involved and the treatment desired. A signal from<br>
the sensor 72 is passed through circuit 74 to the control box 68 for activating valves 46, 54<br>
and 56 in a manner to control the conductivity of the liquid solution 13, as will be detailed<br>
hereinafter.<br>
Liquid solution 13 is suitably pumped through a supply line 76 by an external pump<br>
78 to a boiler, water tower, or other application through a supply line 80. Control box 68<br>
contains suitable conventional electrical circuitry in connection with upper switch 62, lower<br>
switch 64, sensor 72 and solenoid activated valves 46, 54 and 56 to control the operation of<br>
the feed system 10. Control box 68 further includes suitable conventional timer circuits.<br>
Having described the components and features of the feed system 10, the operation<br>
thereof is now described. Initially, the sump 12 is filled with fresh water received through the<br>
water source 26, with solenoid valve 54 in the open position and solenoid valves 46 and 56 in<br>
respective closed positions. Water is piped under suitable pressure, for example, 30 psig<br>
through supply pipe 58 and through the nozzle 22 into bowl 14 through drain 18 to fill sump<br>
12. When the level of water in the sump 12 reaches the lower level switch 64, valve 54 is<br>
closed, thereby preventing any further flow of water to enter sump 12. When the upper level<br>
switch 62 is activated, indicating that the sump 12 is full, none of the valves 46, 54 or 56 can<br>
be opened, thereby protecting the system from any undesirable overflow of water.<br>
When the water level falls below the level of lower level switch 64 for a minimum<br>
period of time, for example, five seconds, the control box 68 opens solenoid valve 46 for a<br>
brief period of time, for example, 0.5 seconds, to allow water to flow from the water source<br>
26 through manifold spray jets 52 to agitate the solution in the sump 12. This is followed by<br>
a brief period, for example, five seconds, to allow for a representative conductivity reading<br>
by sensor 72. Based upon the conductivity of the liquid solution 13 in the sump 12, one of<br>
the appropriate valves 46, 54 or 56 is opened for a short period, for example, ten seconds, to<br>
refill the sump 12 to a level slightly above the lower level switch 64 activation range. If the<br>
conductivity of the liquid solution 13 is below the established conductivity set point, for<br>
mhos<br>
example, 10,000 umhos, solenoid valve 54 will be opened while valves 46 and 56 are<br>
maintained closed. As such, water will be supplied from the water source 26 through spray<br>
nozzle 22 in feed bowl 14 to allow the introduction of dissolved chemicals through drain 18<br>
into sump 12 so as to raise the conductivity of the liquid solution 13 in the sump 12. If, on<br>
the other hand, the conductivity of the liquid solution 13 is above the conductivity set point,<br>
solenoid valve 46 is opened and valves 54 and 56 are maintained closed. Fresh water is thus<br>
supplied through the water source 26 into the sump 12 through manifold jets 52 to thereby<br>
lower the conductivity of the liquid solution 13.<br>
As indicated, feed bowl 14 is thus used as a primary source to raise the conductivity<br>
of the liquid solution 13 in sump 12. When the primary bowl 14 is depleted of its chemical<br>
supply after a certain amount of time has elapsed and the conductivity of the liquid solution<br>
13 is not being raised, the system 10 automatically switches over the primary bowl 14 to<br>
serve as the back-up bowl and the initial back-up bowl 16 to serve as the primary bowl. For<br>
example, if the conductivity of liquid solution 13 is below the predetermined set point,<br>
solenoid valve 54 is opened while valves 46 and 56 are closed to allow fresh water to enter<br>
into feed bowl 14. Should the chemicals in bowl 14 be depleted while valve 54 is normally<br>
opened, only water rather than chemically treated solution, will fill sump 12 through drain 18.<br>
The system control box 68 includes a conventional timing circuit that will preferably allow<br>
for several sump fill cycles to occur before switching over to the back-up bowl 16, so as to<br>
prevent premature switchover. For example, the timing circuit in control box 68 may be set<br>
for a default time of four hours, or any other predetermined time period, before the back-up<br>
bowl 16 is activated to raise the conductivity of the liquid solution 13. Back-up bowl 16 is<br>
activated by closing normally opened valve 54 and opening normally closed valve 56, while<br>
keeping valve 46 closed. After the switchover occurs, the primary bowl 14 may be used to<br>
lower the conductivity of liquid solution 13 through valve 54, rather than through valve 46,<br>
since there are no more chemicals in the bowl 14. It should also be understood that in the<br>
alternative, the conductivity of the liquid solution 13 may be lowered by opening valve 46<br>
and closing valves 54 and 56, thus allowing fresh water to be supplied to sump 12 until liquid<br>
solution conductivity is desirably lowered.<br>
When the operation of system 10 is started with both feed bowls 14 and 16 full of<br>
desired solid chemicals, it does not matter which bowl 14 or 16 serves as the "primary" feed<br>
supply. Over a period of time, whichever bowl serves as the primary source will ultimately<br>
be depleted of chemicals and will reach the point where the conductivity of the liquid<br>
solution 13 in sump 12 cannot be raised above the conductivity set point by solution from that<br>
feed bowl. After a time delay such as four hours, as noted hereinabove, to allow for minor<br>
fluctuations so as to not cause premature switchover, the other bowl will be activated so that<br>
the conductivity of the liquid solution 13 can be raised. At the time the back-up bowl is<br>
switched over, an indication will be provided by the control box 68 to prompt the<br>
replacement of the primary, emptied bowl. Similarly, at the time the control box 68 is<br>
activated for empty bowl replacement, the control box 68 will initiate a short flush, for<br>
example, ten seconds of the initial primary bowl by opening either valve 54 or 56 so that any<br>
residual chemicals in the initial primary feed bowl may be removed upon switching over to<br>
the back-up bowl. Additionally, during operation of the system, the control box may be<br>
programmed in a known manner to simultaneously open all three solenoid valves 46, 54 and<br>
56 for a brief period of time, for example, one second, to maintain the solid chemical feed<br>
moist and also to agitate the liquid solution 13 in the sump 12.<br>
Having described the preferred embodiments of the invention herein, it should be<br>
appreciated that variations may be made thereto without departing from the contemplated<br>
scope thereof. For example, while a particularly preferred arrangement of the system<br>
comprises two feed bowls, it should be appreciated that the system of the present invention<br>
may use three or more such bowls, each one being automatically activated when the supply of<br>
feed in a bowl in prior use is exhausted. Also, while measurement of liquid solution<br>
conductivity, is the preferred manner of controlling the feed supply, it should be understood<br>
that other solution properties, such as pH or oxidation reduction potential (ORP) may also be<br>
used. Further, while water is commonly used as a readily available source, other liquids may<br>
be used in conjunction with suitable solid chemicals to provide desirable liquid solutions for<br>
particular treatment purposes.<br>
In addition, it should also be appreciated while the conductivity of the liquid solution<br>
is controlled as described herein in the context of a dual solid chemical feed system, the<br>
invention contemplates controlling liquid solution in other feed systems that may use one or<br>
more feed bowls. For instance, the system depicted in Figure 1 may be modified to have only<br>
one feed bowl, such as bowl 14. In this situation, when sensor 72 senses that the conductivity<br>
of the liquid solution 13 is below the predetermined conductivity set point, valve 46 will be<br>
closed and valve 54 will be opened, thereby allowing water to be supplied from the water<br>
source 26 through spray nozzle 22. This will cause the introduction of dissolved chemicals<br>
through drain 18 into sump 12 to raise the conductivity of the liquid solution 13. When the<br>
sensor 72 determines that the conductivity of the liquid solution 13 is higher than the<br>
predetermined conductivity set point, a signal is sent to close valve 54 and open valve 46,<br>
thereby allowing fresh water to enter sump 12 from the water source 26 to thereby lower the<br>
conductivity of the liquid solution 13. This process will continue until the chemicals in the<br>
feed bowl 14 are depleted and a new supply of chemicals is provided.<br>
Accordingly, the preferred embodiments described herein are intended in an<br>
illustrative rather than limiting sense. The true scope of the invention is set forth in the<br>
claims appended hereto.<br>

providing at least two feed bowls (14,16), each containing a quantity<br>
of solid chemicals that dissolve upon immersion in water to form a<br>
liquid solution, one of said bowls serving as the primary bowl and<br>
another of said bowls serving as a back-up bowl (16);<br>
supplying water to each bowl from a source (26);<br>
controlling the supply of water to said one (14) of said bowls (14,16)<br>
by means of a first valve (54) coupled to said water source, said first<br>
valve being in a normally open position to allow flow of water to said<br>
one of said bowls;<br>
controlling the supply of water to said another of said bowls (16) by<br>
means of a second valve (56) coupled to said water source, said<br>
second valve being in a normally closed position to prevent flow of<br>
water to said other of said bowls;<br>
receiving liquid solution from each of said bowls in a sump (12) and<br>
containing liquid solution therein at a predetermined level;<br>
sensing the conductivity of said liquid solution by means of a sensor<br>
(72) supported by said sump (12) in communication with liquid<br>
solution and generating a signal at a predetermined conductivity of<br>
said liquid solution to indicate that he chemical in said one of said<br>
bowls is depleted; and<br>
closing said first valve (54) by means of a control unit (68) responsive<br>
to said signal, thereby preventing flow of water to said one of said<br>
bowls (14) and opening said second valve, thereby allowing flow of<br>
water to another of said bowls (16), with said another of said bowls<br>
(16) serving as the primary bowl.<br>
A method as claimed in claim 1, comprising delaying the activation<br>
of said valves (54, 56) for a certain period of time after said sensor<br>
(72) detects said predetermined conductivity.<br>
A method as claimed in claim 1, comprising introducing water into<br>
said sump through a manifold disposed in said sump, said<br>
manifold comprising multiple spraying jets.<br>
A method as claimed in claim 3, including controlling the<br>
introduction of water into said sump through said manifold by<br>
means of a third valve (46), said third valve being coupled to said<br>
water source (26).<br>
A method as claimed in claim 4, comprising providing a signal to<br>
said control unit (68) when the level of said liquid solution falls<br>
below said predetermined level by means of a lower level switch<br>
(64) supported by said sump (12) for communication with said<br>
liquid solution.<br>
A method as claimed in claim 5, comprising opening said third<br>
valve to allow flow of water into said sump through said manifold,<br>
said third valve (46) being responsive to said signal from said lower<br>
level switch (64).<br>
A method as claimed in claim 6, further comprising providing a<br>
signal to said first, second and third valves (54, 56,46) to keep all<br>
such valves in a closed position to thereby prevent any flow of<br>
water to said bowls and said sump, said signal being provided by<br>
an upper level switch (62) supported by said sump (12) for<br>
communicating with said liquid solution contained therein.<br>
A solid chemical feed system,<br>
preferably including two feed bowls (14, 16),<br>
comprises a quantity of solid chemicals that<br>
dissolve upon immersion in water to form a<br>
liquid solution. A sump (12) is provided to<br>
receive liquid solution from the feed bowls (14,<br>
16), the liquid solution with additive chemicals<br>
being used to inhibit corrosion and rust. The<br>
feed system comprises a valve system (46,<br>
54, 56) that is controlled by a sensor (72) that<br>
detects the conductivity of the liquid solution<br>
to alternatingly switch the introduction of liquid<br>
solution from one feed bowl (14) to the other<br>
feed bowl (16). Upon depletion of chemical<br>
feed in one bowl (14, 16), desired treatment will<br>
continue and the empty bowl may be replaced<br>
without disruption.</td>
