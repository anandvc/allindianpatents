FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
[0001J The present invention relates to novel compounds that affect monoamine receptors, including serotonin receptors. The invention specifically provides compounds that are active as inverse agonists, and therefore also as antagonists, at the 5-HT2A subtype of human serotonin receptors. The invention also provides methods, utilising the compounds of the invention for modulating 5-HT2A receptor-mediated events that are useful for treating or alleviating disease conditions in which modification of the activity of these receptors is beneficial.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0002]	Serotonin or 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) plays a significant role in the<br>
functioning of the mammalian body. In the central nervous system, 5-HT is an important neurotransmitter and neuromodulator that is implicated in such diverse behaviors and responses as sleeping, eating, locomotion, perceiving pain, learning and memory, sexual behavior, controlling body temperature and blood pressure. In the spinal column, serotonin plays an important role in the control systems of the afferent peripheral nociceptors (Moulignier, Rev. Neurol. 150:3-15, (1994)). Peripheral functions in the cardiovascular, hematological and gastrointestinal systems have also been ascribed to 5-HT. 5-HT has been found to mediate a variety of contractile, secretory, and electrophysiologic effects including vascular and nonvascular smooth muscle contraction, and platelet aggregation. (Fuller, Biology of Serotonergic Transmission, 1982; Boullin, Serotonin In Mental Abnormalities 1:316 (1978); Barchas, et al., Serotonin and Behavior, (1973)). The 5-HT2A receptor subtype (also referred to as subclass) is widely yet discretely expressed in the human brain, including many cortical, limbic, and forebrain regions postulated to be involved in the modulation of higher cognitive and affective functions. This receptor subtype is also expressed on mature platelets where it mediates, in part, platelet aggregation, one of the initial steps in the process of vascular thrombosis. Given the broad distribution of serotonin within the body, tremendous interest in drugs that affect serotonergic systems exists (Gershon, et al., The Peripheral Actions of 5-Hydroxytryptamine, 246 (1989); Saxena, et al., J. Cardiovascular Pharmacol. 15: Supp. 7 (1990)).<br>
[0003]	Serotonin receptors are members of a large human gene family of membrane-<br>
spanning proteins that function as transducers of intercellular communication. They exist on the surface of various cell types, including neurons and platelets, where, upon their activation by either their endogenous ligand serotonin or exogenously administered drugs, they change their conformational structure and subsequently interact with downstream mediators of cellular<br>
2<br><br>
signaling. Many of these receptors, including the 5-HT2A subclass, are G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) that signal by activating guanine nucleotide binding proteins (G-proteins), resulting in the generation, or inhibition of, second messenger molecules such as cyclic AMP, inositol phosphates, and diacylglycerol. These second messengers then modulate the function of a variety of intracellular enzymes, including kinases and ion channels, which ultimately affect cellular excitability and function.<br>
[0004] At least 15 genetically distinct 5-HT receptor subtypes have been identified and assigned to one of seven families (5-HT1-7). Each subtype displays a unique distribution, preference for various ligands, and functional correlate(s).<br>
[0005]	Serotonin may be an important component in various types of pathological<br>
conditions such as psychiatric disorders (depression, aggressiveness, panic attacks, obsessive compulsive disorders, psychosis, schizophrenia, suicidal tendency), neurodegenerative disorders (Alzheimer-type dementia, Parkinsonism, Huntington's chorea), anorexia, bulimia, disorders associated with alcoholism, cerebral vascular accidents, and migraine (Meltzer, Neuropsychopharmacology, 21:106S-115S (1999); Barnes &amp; Sharp, Neuropharmacology, 38:1083-1152 (1999); Glennon, Neurosci. Biobehavioral Rev., 14:35 (1990)). Recent evidence strongly implicates the 5-HT2 receptor subtype in the etiology of such medical conditions as hypertension, thrombosis, migraine, vasospasm, ischemia, depression, anxiety, psychosis, schizophrenia, sleep disorders and appetite disorders.<br>
[0006] Schizophrenia is a particularly devastating neuropsychiatric disorder that affects approximately 1% of the human population. It has been estimated that the total financial cost for the diagnosis, treatment, and lost societal productivity of individuals affected by this disease exceeds 2% of the gross national product (GNP) of the United States. Current treatment primarily involves pharmacotherapy with a class of drugs known as antipsychotics. Antipsychotics are effective in ameliorating positive symptoms (e.g., hallucinations and delusions), yet they frequently do not improve negative symptoms (e.g., social and emotional withdrawal, apathy, and poverty of speech).<br>
[0007] Currently, nine major classes of antipsychotics are prescribed to treat psychotic symptoms. Use of these compounds is limited, however, by their side effect profiles. Nearly all of the "typical" or older generation compounds have significant adverse effects on human motor function. These "extrapyramidal" side effects, so termed due to their effects on modulatory human motor systems, can be both acute (e.g., dystonic reactions, a potentially life threatening but rare neuroleptic malignant syndrome) and chronic (e.g., akathisias, tremors, and tardive dyskinesia). Drug development efforts have, therefore, focused on newer "atypical" agents free of these adverse effects.<br>
3<br><br>
[0008] Antipsychotic drugs have been shown to interact with a large number of central monoaminergic neurotransmitter receptors, including dopaminergic, serotonergic, adrenergic, muscarinic, and histaminergic receptors. It is likely that the therapeutic and adverse effects of these drugs are mediated by distinct receptor subtypes. The high degree of genetic and pharmacological homology between these receptor subtypes has hampered the development of subtype-selective compounds, as well as the determination of the normal physiologic or pathophysiologic role of any particular receptor subtype. Thus, there is a need to develop drugs that are selective for individual receptor classes and subclasses amongst monoaminergic neurotransmitter receptors,<br>
[0009] One theory for the mechanism of action of antipsychotic drugs involves antagonism of dopamine D2 receptors. Unfortunately, it is likely that antagonism of dopamine D2 receptors also mediates the extrapyramidal side effects. Antagonism of 5-HT2A is an alternate molecular mechanism for drugs with antipsychotic efficacy, possibly through antagonism of heightened or exaggerated signal transduction through serotonergic systems. 5-HT2A antagonists are therefore good candidates for treating psychosis without extrapyramidal side effects.<br>
[0010] Traditionally, these receptors have been assumed to exist in a quiescent state unless activated by the binding of an agonist (a drug that activates a receptor). It is now appreciated that many, if not most, of the GPCR monoamine receptors, including serotonin receptors, can exist in a partially activated state in the absence of their endogenous agonists. This increased basal activity (constitutive activity) can be inhibited by compounds called inverse agonists. Both agonists and inverse agonists possess intrinsic activity at a receptor, in that they can activate or inactivate these molecules, respectively. In contrast, classic or neutral antagonists compete against agonists and inverse agonists for access to the receptor, but do not possess the intrinsic ability to inhibit elevated basal or constitutive receptor responses.<br>
[0011]	We have recently elucidated an important aspect of 5-HT2A receptor<br>
function by applying the Receptor Selection and Amplification Technology (U.S. Patent 5,707,798, 1998; Chem Abstr. 128:111548 (1998) and citations therein), to the study of the 5-HT2 subclass of serotonin receptors. R-SAT is a phenotypic assay of receptor function that involves the heterologous expression of receptors in mammalian fibroblasts. Using this technology we were able to demonstrate that native 5-HT2A receptors possess significant constitutive, or agonist-independent, receptor activity (Weiner et. al. J, Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2001, 299 (1), 268-276.). Furthermore, by directly testing a large number of centrally acting medicinal compounds with known clinical activity in neuropsychiatry disease, we determined that compounds with antipsychotic; efficacy all shared a common molecular property. Nearly all of these compounds, which are used by psychiatrists to treat psychosis, were found to be potent<br>
4<br><br>
5-HT2A inverse agonists. This unique clinico-pharmacologic correlation at a single receptor subtype is compelling evidence that 5-HT2A receptor inverse agonism is a molecular mechanism of antipsychotic efficacy in humans.<br>
[0012] Detailed pharmacological characterization of a large number of antipsychotic compounds revealed that they possess broad activity at multiple related receptor subtypes. Most of these compounds display agonist, competitive antagonist, or inverse agonist activity at multiple monoaminergic receptor subtypes, including serotoninergic, dopaminergic, adrenergic, muscarinic and histaminergic receptors. This broad activity is likely responsible for the sedating, hypotensive, and motor side effects of these compounds. It would therefore be of great advantage to develop compounds that are selective inverse agonists of the 5-HT2A receptor, but which have little or no activity on other monamine receptor subtypes, especially dopamine D2 receptors. Such compounds may be useful in the treatment of human disease (e.g., as anti-psychotics), and may avoid the adverse side effects associated with non-selective receptor interactions.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0034] For the purpose of the current disclosure, the following definitions shall in their entireties be used to define technical terms. The term "Constitutive activity" is defined as the elevated basal activity of a receptor, which is independent of the presence of an agonist. Constitutive activity of a receptor may be measured using a number of different methods, including cellular (e.g., membrane) preparations (see, e.g., Barr &amp;. Manning, J, Biol. Chem. 272:32979-87 (1997)), purified reconstituted receptors with or without the associated G-protein in phospholipid vesicles (Cerione et al., Biochemistry 23:4519-25 (1984)), and functional cellular assays (U.S. Patent Application Ser. No. 09/413,626).<br>
8<br><br>
[0035] The term "agonist" is defined as a compound that increases the activity of a receptor when it contacts the receptor.<br>
[0036] The term "antagonist" is defined as a compound that competes with an agonist or inverse agonist for binding to a receptor, thereby blocking the action of an agonist or inverse agonist on the receptor. However, an antagonist (also known as a "neutral" antagonist) has no effect on constitutive receptor activity.<br>
[0037] The term "inverse agonist" is defined as a compound that decreases the basal activity of a receptor (i.e., signaling mediated by the receptor). Such compounds are also known as negative antagonists. An inverse agonist is a ligand for a receptor that causes the receptor to adopt an inactive state relative to a basal state occurring in the absence of any ligand. Thus, while an antagonist can inhibit the activity of an agonist, an inverse agonist is a ligand that can alter the conformation of the receptor in the absence of an agonist. The concept of an inverse agonist has been explored by Bond et al. in Nature 374:272 (1995). More specifically, Bond et al. have proposed that unliganded (3 2~adrenoceptor exists in an equilibrium between an inactive conformation and a spontaneously active conformation. Agonists are proposed to stabilize the receptor in an active conformation. Conversely, inverse agonists are believed to stabilize an inactive receptor conformation. Thus, while an antagonist manifests its activity by virtue of inhibiting an agonist, an inverse agonist can additionally manifest its activity in the absence of an agonist by inhibiting the spontaneous conversion of an unliganded receptor to an active conformation.<br>
[0038] The term "5-HT2A receptor" is defined as a receptor, having an activity corresponding to the activity of the human serotonin receptor subtype, which was characterized through molecular cloning and pharmacology as detailed in Saltzman et al., Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 181:1469-78; and Julius et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 87:928-932.<br>
[0039] The term "subject" refers to an animal, such as a mammal, for example, a human, who is the object of treatment, observation or experiment.<br>
[0040] The term "selective" is defined as a property of a compound whereby an amount of the compound sufficient to effect a desired response from a particular receptor type, subtype, class or subclass causes a substantially smaller or no effect upon the activity other receptor types.<br>
[0041]	The terms "selectivity" or "selective," in relation to an inverse agonist, are<br>
understood as a property of a compound whereby an amount of compound that effectively inversely agonizes the 5-HT2A receptor, and thereby decreases its activity, causes little or no inverse agonistic or antagonistic activity at other, related or unrelated, receptors. In particular, the compounds of the invention have surprisingly been found not to interact strongly with other serotonin receptors (5-HT 1A, IB, ID, IE, IF, 2B, 2C, 4A, 6, and 7) at concentrations where the<br>
9<br><br>
signaling of the 5-HT2A receptor is strongly or completely inhibited. The compounds of the invention can also be selective with respect to other monoamine-binding receptors, such as the dopaminergic, histaminergic, adrenergic and muscarinic receptors. Compounds that are highly selective for 5-HT2A receptors may have a beneficial effect in the treatment of psychosis, schizophrenia or similar neuropsychiatric disorders, while avoiding adverse effects associated with other drugs.<br>
[0042] The EC50 for an agonist is intended to denote the concentration of a compound needed to achieve 50% of a maximal response seen in R-SAT. For inverse agonists, EC50 is intended to denote the concentration of a compound needed to achieve 50% inhibition of an R-SAT response from basal, no compound, levels.<br>
[0043] As used herein, the term "coadministration" refers to the delivery of two or more separate chemical entities, whether in vitro or in vivo. Coadministration refers to the simultaneous delivery of separate agents; to the simultaneous delivery of a mixture of agents; as well as to the delivery of one agent followed by delivery of a second agent or additional agents. In all cases, agents that are coadministered are intended to work in conjunction with each other.<br>

[0070] The compounds of formula I exhibit activity at monoamine receptors, specifically serotonin receptors. Certain compounds share the common property of acting as inverse agonists at the 5-HT2A receptor. Thus, experiments performed on cells transiently expressing the human phenotype of said receptor have shown that the compounds of general formula (I) attenuate the signaling of such receptors in the absence of additional ligands acting upon the receptor. The compounds have thus been found to possess intrinsic activity at this receptor and are able to attenuate the basal, non-agonist-stimulated, constitutive signaling responses that the 5-HT2A receptor displays. The observation that the compounds of general formula (I) are inverse agonists also indicates that these compounds have the ability to antagonize the activation of 5-HT2A receptors that is mediated by endogenous agonists or exogenous synthetic agonist ligands.<br>
[0071] The invention therefore provides compounds of formula I, salts and stereoisomers thereof, including compounds that show a relatively high degree of selectivity towards the 5-HT2A subtype of serotonin receptors relative to other subtypes of the serotonin (5-HT) family of receptors as well as to other receptors, most particularly the monoaminergic G-<br>
15<br><br>
protein coupled receptors, such as dopamine receptors. In one embodiment, the compounds of the invention act as inverse agonists at the 5-HT2A subtype of serotonin receptors.<br>
[0072] The compounds of general formula (I) may therefore be useful for treating or alleviating symptoms of disease conditions associated with impaired function, in particular elevated levels of activity, of especially 5-HT2A receptors, whether this impaired function is associated with improper levels of receptor stimulation or phenotypical aberrations.<br>
[0073] Others have previously hypothesised that certain neuropsychological diseases might be caused by altered levels of constitutive activity of monoamine receptors. Such constitutive activity might be modified via contacting the relevant receptor with a synthetic inverse agonist. By directly testing a large number of centrally acting medicinal compounds with known clinical activity in neuropsychiatric disease, compounds with antipsychotic efficacy all shared a common molecular property. Nearly all of these compounds that are used by psychiatrists to treat psychosis were found to be potent 5-HT2A inverse agonists. This correlation is compelling evidence that 5-HT2A receptor inverse agonism is a molecular mechanism of antipsychotic efficacy in humans.<br>
[0074] Detailed pharmacological characterization of a large number of antipsychotic compounds in our laboratory revealed that they possess broad activity at multiple related receptor subtypes. Most of these compounds display either agonist, competitive antagonist, or inverse agonist activity at multiple monoaminergic receptor subtypes including serotoninergic, dopaminergic, adrenergic, muscarinic and histaminergic receptors. This broad activity is likely responsible for the sedating, hypotensive, and motor side effects of these compounds. It therefore follows that the compounds disclosed herein will possess efficacy as, for example, novel antipsychotics, but will have fewer or less severe side effects than existing compounds.<br>
[0075] The present invention is also directed to pharmaceutical compositions comprising a compound of general formula I.<br>
[0076] Within this embodiment, at least two of R4, R5, and R6 may be independently selected from the group consisting of 4-monosubstituted-aryl(C1-6 alkyl), and 4- monosubstituted-heteroaryl(C1-6 alkyl).<br>

In a suitable embodiment, the C,_6 alkyl of said aryl(C1-6alkyl), heteroaryl(C1-6 alkyl), heterocyclyl(C1-6 alkyl) may be substituted so as to form a branched hydrocarbon.<br>

[0085]	Certain embodiments of the compounds of the invention possess chirality or<br>
have a chiral centre. The invention provides compounds of the invention in their racemic form, enantio-enriched forms or enantiopure forms. The present investigators have isolated individual enantiomers of high enantiomeric excess of certain chiral embodiments of the compounds of the invention and found non-identical activity of the two forms towards monoamine receptors.<br>
21<br><br>
[00S6] A preferred embodiment of compounds of the invention is comprised of compounds of formula I which are homochiral to the compound of Formula II.<br>
[0087] The Examples demonstrate suitable methods of preparation of many of the compounds of the invention, said methods being adaptable to the preparation of all of the compounds of the invention by methods known to the person skilled in the art. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compounds of the formula I are also within the scope of the invention.<br>
[0088] The compounds of the invention may in general be prepared by routes such as those summarised below. Many of the synthetic routes described below require protecting group strategies, which include groups such as those described in T. W. Greene and P. G. M. Wuts, Protective Groups in Organic Chemistry, 3. Ed. John Wiley &amp; Sons, 1999, and they should be chosen in such a way, that they are stable to the reaction conditions applied and readily removed at a convenient stage using methodology known from the art. Typical protecting groups are N-Boc, N-Cbz, N-Bn.<br>
[0089] Cyclisation of the appropriate intermediates may be generally achieved with phosgene or its analogues such as CDI, with chloroacetylchloride or equivalents thereof or by treatment with carbondisulfide and subsequent oxidation.<br>
[0090] Introduction of the desired piperidine substituent (R1) can generally be achieved, after N-deprotection if required, by alkylation or by reductive animation.<br>
[0091] Compounds of the invention in which m = 1, Z = CH and X = O or OCH2 may be synthesized from suitably protected 4-piperidone as described by Bassus et al. (Eur. J. Med. Chem. - Chim. Ther. 9:416-423 (1974)). Alkylation of the carbamate nitrogen and introduction of the desired piperidine Af-substituent leads to the 3,5-disubstituted spirocycle. 3,4 or 4,5-disubstituted derivatives may be prepared as described by Fisera et al. (Monatsh. Chem. 125:909-919 (1994)), via an appropriately substituted isoxazoline, followed by reductive cleavage. Cyclisation of the resulting Y-aminoalcohols gives the desired spirocycles. Alternatively, 4,5-disubstituted or 3,4,5-trisubstituted spirocycles may be prepared from an appropriate p-ketoester by reaction with a halide to introduce the 5-substituent, reductive amination (with a primary amine for the 3-substituent), treatment with allyl magnesium bromide, cyclisation as described above, oxidative cleavage of the double bonds (e.g. by ozonolysis) and formation of the piperidine ring by reductive amination.<br>
[0092]	Compounds of the invention in which m = 1, Z = N and X = O or OCH2 may<br>
be prepared by a Strecker synthesis involving an appropriate aldehyde and e.g. terf-butyl carbazate. The nitrile may be transformed into an ester, which is reacted with allyl magnesium bromide, followed by oxidative cleavage of the two olefins, formation of the piperidine by reductive amination. Alkylation, deprotection of the hydrazide and cyclisation gives the desired spirocycles. Depending on the desired substituents and their positions, these steps may be<br>
22<br><br>
inversed and additional protection steps of functional groups may be required. Alternatively, the compounds may be obtained from an appropriate p-ketoester by reaction with a bis(2-chloroethyl) amine derivative to form the piperidine ring. Reductive amination, saponification and Curtius rearrangement lead to the cyclic urea derivative.<br>
[0093] Compounds of the invention in which m = 1, Z = N and X = N(R) may be prepared adapting methods described by Bhatia et al. (J. Med. Chem. 39:3938-3950 (1996)) starting from the suitably protected Strecker-product 4-amino-4-cyano-piperidine.<br>
[0094] Compounds of the invention in which m = 0, Z = CH and X = CH2CH2 may be synthesized by Michael addition of a nitrile-derivative to suitably protected 4-methoxycarbonyl-methylenepiperidine, reduction of the nitrile-group to the amine, followed by lactam ring formation, alkylation of the resulting amide and introduction of the desired piperidine substituent.<br>
[0095] Compounds of the invention in which m = 0, Z = CH and X = CH20 may be prepared from the appropriate p-ketoester by reaction with a suitably protected bis(2-chloroethyl) amine. Reductive amination, followed by reduction of the nitrile to the alcohol followed by cyclisation and introduction of the piperidine substituent by alkylation or reductive amination leads to the desired spirocycle.<br>
[0096] Compounds of the invention in which m = 0, Z = CH and X = CH2N may be prepared from the appropriate p-ketonitrile by reaction with a suitably protected bis(2-chloroethyl) amine. Reductive amination, followed by reduction of the nitrile to the amine followed by cyclisation and introduction of the piperidine substituent by alkylation or reductive amination leads to the desired spirocycle.<br>
[0097] Compounds of the invention in which m = 0, Z = CH and X = OCH2 may be prepared as described in Example 1.<br>
[0098] Compounds of the invention in which m = 0, Z = N and X = CH2CH2 may be prepared from protected 8-aza-l-oxa-spiro[4.5]decan-2-one (Mullen et al. J. Med. Chem. 43:4045 (2000)) by reaction with hydrazine, then S-ethyltrifluorothioacetate, followed by a Mitsunobu reaction according to Meng et al. {Tetrahedron 47:6251 (1991)). The appropriate substituents in 1,2- and 9-positions are introduced by alkylation and/or reductive amination.<br>
[0099] Compounds of the invention in which m = 0, Z = N and X = CH20 may be prepared by a Strecker synthesis from suitably protected 4-piperidone and a carbazate (or an appropriate hydrazine). Transformation of the resulting nitrile into the alcohol, cyclisation using methods described above, alkylation (after basic hydrolysis of the exocyclic carbazate function if present) and introduction of the piperidine N-substituent leads to the desired compound.<br>
23<br><br>
[0100] Compounds of the invention in which m = 0, Z = N and X = CH2N may be prepared using the same strategy as for the preparation of l,2,9-triaza-4-oxa-spiro[5.5]undecan-3-one, except that the nitrile is reduced to the corresponding amine.<br>
[0101] Compounds of the invention in which m = 0, Z = CH and X = CH2 may be synthesized by Michael addition of a nitro-derivative to suitably protected 4-methoxycarbonyl-methylenepiperidine, reduction of the nitro-group to the amine, followed by lactam ring formation, alkylation of the resulting amide and introduction of the desired piperidine substituent.<br>
[0102] Compounds of the invention in which m = 0, Z = CH and X = O may be prepared as described in Example 1. Alternatively, a nitroaldol reaction may be used to obtain the desired intermediate 1,2-aminoalcohol after reduction of the nitro-group, followed by cyclisation. Alternatively, the compounds may be prepared by epoxidation of an appropriate olefin, obtained by Wittig or Horner-Wadsworth-Emmons reactions from suitably protected 4-piperidone. Epoxide opening with ammonia or a primary amine, followed by cyclisation with a phosgene equivalent, alkylation of the carbamates if required and introduction of the desired piperidine substituent by alkylation or reductive amination leads to the target compound. Besides the preparation of enantiopure compound as described in Example 1, an enantioselective modification may include an asymmetric epoxidation method of the olefin as described in the literature, e.g. Jacobsen or others. Alternatively, Sharpless asymmetric dihydroxylation method may be used followed by epoxide ring formation. Alternatively, suitably protected 4-methoxycarbonyl-methylenepiperidine may be reduced to the allyl alcohol which is subjected to Sharpless asymmetric epoxidation according to literature procedure. Epoxide opening with a metallorganic reagent and oxidation of the resulting primary alcohol leads to the p-hydroxy carboxylic acid, which is converted into the desired spirocyclic enantiomer as described in Example 1. Alternatively, suitably protected 4-methoxycarbonyl-methylenepiperidine may be converted to an enantiomerically pure epoxide by Jacobsen epoxidation, followed by ring opening with ammonia or an appropriate amine, reaction with a metallorganic reagent with the ester group, reduction, cyclisation, alkylation if required and introduction of the piperidine substituent. Alternatively, the stereocenter may be introduced by using an appropriate a-amino acid ester as the chiral template. Reaction with allyl magnesium bromide, cyclisation, oxidative cleavage of the allyl groups, formation of the piperidine ring by reductive amination and final alkylation of the carbamate leads to the desired enantiomerically pure derivative.<br>
[0103]	Compounds of the invention in which m = 0, Z = CH and X = N or NCH2<br>
may be prepared by a Strecker synthesis involving suitably protected 4-piperidone and an appropriate primary amine. Reaction of the resulting nitrile with a Grignard reagent gives the ketone, which is then subjected to a reductive amination. Cyclisation of the resulting diamine (after deprotection step if necessary), with phosgene or an equivalent thereof leads to the cyclic<br>

urea. Alkylation or reductive amination steps may be used to introduce N-piperidine substituents. In a similar way, the 6-membered analogue (X = NCH2) may be obtained by using chloroacetyl chloride or a similar reagent for cyclisation (additional use of protecting groups may be necessary).<br>

[0105] Compounds of the invention in which m = 0, Z = N and X = N(R) may be obtained according to literature methods (Gstach et al. Synthesis 803-808 (1990)) by treatment of a suitably protected 4-piperidone by reaction with a hydrazine derivative and reaction of the intermediate hydrazone with potassium cyanate. Alkylation and/or reductive amination after deprotection may be used to introduce the desired substituents.<br>
[0106]	Alternatively, compounds of the invention in which X = S or SCH2 or CH2S<br>
may be obtained as described by routes described for the equivalent compounds bearing X = O, OCH2 or CH20 by transforming, prior to cyclisation, the appropriate hydroxyl group into a thiol using well known literature procedures (e.g. treatment with acetyl chloride and substitution with benzylthiol and conversion to the free mercaptane). Similarly, the hydroxyl group may be converted into the corresponding amines, which constitutes an alternative way to access some compounds of the invention in which X = N(R), N(R)CH2, CH2(R).<br>
[0107] Compounds of the invention in which Y = S may be prepared from the corresponding compounds in which Y = O by treatment with e.g. the Lawesson reagent or bis(tricyclohexyltin)sulfide and BC13 or other sulphur-transferring reagents.<br>

Example 2: Pharmacological Data<br>
Receptor Selection and Amplification (R-SAT) Assays.<br>
[0210] The functional receptor assay, Receptor Selection and Amplification Technology (R-SAT), was used (with minor modifications from that previously described US 5,707,798) to screen compounds for efficacy at the 5-HT2A receptor. Briefly, NIH3T3 cells were grown in 96 well tissue culture plates to 70-80% confluence. Cells were transfected for 12-16 hours with plasmid DNAs using superfect (Qiagen Inc.) as per manufacture's protocols. R-SAT's were generally performed with 50 ng/well of receptor and 20 ng/well of Beta-galactosidase plasmid DNA- All receptor and G-protein constructs used were in the pSI<br>
44<br><br>
mammalian expression vector (Promega Inc) as described in U.S. 5,707,798. The 5HT2A receptor gene was amplified by nested PCR from brain cDNA using the oligodeoxynucleotides based on the published sequence (see Saltzman et. al. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 181:1469-78 (1991)). Large-scale transfections, cells were transfected for 12-16 hours, then trypsinized and frozen in DMSO. Frozen cells were later thawed, plated at 10,000-40,000 cells per well of a 96 well plate that contained drug. With both methods, cells were then grown in a humidified atmosphere with 5% ambient C02 for five days. Media was then removed from the plates and marker gene activity was measured by the addition of the beta-galactosidase substrate ONPG (in PBS with 5% NP-40). The resulting colorimetric reaction was measured in a spectrophotometric plate reader (Titertek Inc.) at 420 nM. All data were analyzed using the computer program XLFit (IDBSm). Efficacy is the percent maximal repression compared to repression by a control compound (ritanserin in the case of 5HT2A). pIC50 is the negative of the log(IC5o), where IC50 is the calculated concentration in Molar that produces 50% maximal repression. The results obtained for several compounds of the invention are presented in Table 1, below.<br>

Methods<br>
Animals and apparatus<br>
[0212] Male Non-Swiss Albino mice (Harlan Sprague-Dawley) were housed (4 mice/cage) in rooms with temperature and humidity controlled and water and food (Harlan Teklad) freely available. Mice were kept on a 12-hr light:dark cycle. For locomotor experiments, plastic 20x20x30cm activity cages were equipped with photocell beams (AccuScan Instruments).<br>
Procedure Locomotor Activity<br>
[0213] For hyperactivity experiments, mice were treated with 0.3 mg/kg dizocilpine i.p. 15 min before the session. Mice were treated with 69NLS75 s.c. 10 min before the session or p.o. 30 min before the session and placed into the activity cages. For spontaneous activity, 69NLS75 was administered alone. Locomotor data were collected during a 15 min session without habituation in a lit room. Each dose combination was tested in a separate group of animals (n=8). Distance traveled (cm) was calculated and averaged followed by ANOVA and post-hoc Dunnett's t-test comparisons.<br>
Results<br>
[0214] 69NLS75 caused a dose-related decrease in MK-801-induced hyperactivity in mice consistent with antipsychotic efficacy. A statistically significant decrease compared to vehicle control occurred at 3 mg/kg after both s.c. and p.o. admininstration suggesting excellent oral bioavailability. In addition, the attenuation of MK-801 hyperactivity occurred at doses that had no effect on spontaneous locomotor activity, indicating no motor side effects at efficacious doses.<br>
