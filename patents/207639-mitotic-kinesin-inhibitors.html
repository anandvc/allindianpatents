fhis invention relates to Mitotic Kinesin Inhibitors<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
These inventions particularly, relates to dihydropyrrole derivatives that are<br><br>
inhibitors of mitotic kinesins, in.particular the mitotic kinesin KSP, and are useful in the treatment of cellular proliferative diseases, for example cancer, hyperplasias, restenosis, cardiac hypertrophy, immune disorders and inflammation.<br>
Among the therapeutic agents used to treat cancer are the taxanes and vinca alkaloids. 1 axanes and vinca alkaloids act on microtubules, which are present in a variety of cellular structures. Microtubules are the primary structural element of the mitotic spindle. The mitotic spindle is responsible for distribution of replicate copies of the genome to each of the two daughter cells that result from cell division. It is presumed that disruption of the mitotic spindle by these drugs results in inhibition of cancer cell division, and induction of cancer cell death. However, microtubules form other types of cellular structures, including tracks for intracellular transport in nerve processes. Because these agents do not specifically target mitotic spindles, they have side effects that limit their usefulness.<br>
Improvements in the specificity of agents used to treat cancer is of considerable interest because of the therapeutic benefits which would be realized if the side effects associated with the administration of these agents could be reduced. Traditionally, dramatic improvements in the treatment of cancer are associated with identification of therapeutic agents acting through novel mechanisms. Examples of this include not only the taxanes, but also the camptothecin class of topoisomerase I inhibitors. From both of these perspectives, mitotic kinesins are attractive targets for new anti-cancer agents.<br>
j Mitotic kinesins are enzymes essential for assembly and function of the mitotic spindle, but are not generally part of other microtubule structures, such as in nerve processes. Mitotic kinesins play essential roles during all phases of mitosis. Ihesc en/ymes are "molecular motors" that transform energy released by hydrolysis of A IP into mechanical force which drives the directional movement of cellular cargoes along microtubules. The catalytic domain sufficient for this task is a compact structure o\' approximately 340 amino acids. During mitosis, kinesins organize microtubules into the  bipolar structure that  is the mitotic spindle.  Kinesins mediate movement of<br><br>
chromosomes along spindle microtubules, as well as structural changes in the mitotic spindle associated with specific phases of mitosis. Experimental perturbation of mitotic kinesin function causes malformation or dysfunction of the mitotic spindle, frequently resulting in cell cycle arrest and cell death.<br>
Among the mitotic kinesins which have been identified is KSP. KSP belongs to an evolutionarily conserved kinesin subfamily of plus end-directed microtubule motors that assemble into bipolar homotetramers consisting of antiparallel homodimers. During mitosis KSP associates with microtubules of the mitotic spindle. Microinjection of antibodies directed against KSP into human cells prevents spindle pole separation during prometaphase, giving rise to monopolar spindles and causing mitotic arrest and induction of programmed cell death. KSP and related kinesins in other, non-human, organisms, bundle antiparallel microtubules and slide them relative to one another, thus forcing the two spindle poles apart. KSP may also mediate in anaphase B spindle elongation and focussing of microtubules at the spindle pole.<br>
Human KSP (also termed HsEg5) has been described [Blangy, et al.. Cell, 83:1159-69 (1995); Whitehead, et al., Arthritis Rheum,, 39:1635-42 (1996); Galgio et al., J, Cell Biol., 135:339-414 (1996); Blangy, et al., J Biol. Chem., 272:19418-24 (1997); Blangy, et al., Cell Motil Cytoskeleton, 40:174-82 (1998); Whitehead and Ratmer, J. Cell Sci., 111:2551-61 (1998); Kaiser, et al., JBC 274:18925-31 (1999); GenBank accession numbers: X85137, NM004523 and U37426], and a fragment of the KSP gene (TRIP5) has been described [Lee, et al., Mol Endocrinol., 9:243-54 (1995); GenBank accession number L40372]. Xenopus KSP homologs (Eg5), as well as Drosophila K-LP61 F/KRP 130 have been reported.<br>
Certain quinazolinones have recently been described as being inhibitors of KSP (PCT Publ. WO 01/30768, May 3, 2001).<br>
Mitotic kinesins are attractive targets for the discovery and development of novel mitotic chemotherapeutics. Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide compounds, methods and compositions useful in the inhibition of KSP, a mitotic kinesin,<br>

I he compounds of the present invention may have asymmetric centers, chiral axes, and chiral planes (as described in: E.L. Eliel and S.H. Wilen, Stereochemistry of Carbon Compounds, John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York, 1994, pages 1119-1190), and occur as racemates, racemic mixtures, and as individual diastereomers, with all possible isomers and mixtures thereof, including optical isomers, all such stereoisomers being included in the present invention. In addition, the compounds disclosed herein may exist as tautomers and both tautomeric forms are intended to be encompassed by the scope of the invention, even though only one tautomeric structure is depicted.<br>
When any variable (e.g. R10, Rl 1, Rl2, etc.) occurs more than one time in any constituent, its definition on each occurrence is independent at every other occurrence. Also, combinations of substituents and variables are permissible only if such combinations result in stable compounds. Lines drawn into the ring systems from substituents represent that the indicated bond may be attached to any of the substitutable ring atoms. If the ring system is polycyclic, it is intended that the bond be attached to any of the suitable carbon atoms on the proximal ring only.<br><br>
It is understood that substituents and substitution patterns on the compounds of the instant invention can be selected by one of ordinary skill in the art to provide compounds that are chemically stable and that can be readily synthesized by techniques known in the art, as well as those methods set forth below, from readily available starting materials. If a substituent is itself substituted with more than one group, it is understood that these multiple groups may be on the same carbon or on different carbons, so long as a stable structure results. The phrase -optionally substituted with one or more substituents- should be taken to be equivalent to the phrase -optionally substituted with at least one substituent- and in such cases the preferred embodiment will have from zero to three substituents.<br>
As used herein, -alkyl- is intended to include both branched and straight-chain saturated aliphatic hydrocarbon groups having the specified number of carbon atoms. For example, C]-C10, as in -C1-C10 alkyl- is defined to include groups having 1, 2, 3,<br>
4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 or 10 carbons in a linear or branched arrangement.  For example, -C1-<br>
C]0 alkyl- specifically includes methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, i-propyl, n-butyl,t/-butyl, i-<br>
butyl, pentyl, hexyl, heptyl, octyl, nonyl, decyl, and so on. The term -cycloalkyl-means a monocyclic saturated aliphatic hydrocarbon group having the specified number of carbon atoms. For example, -cycloalkyl- includes cyclopropyl, methyl-cyclopropyl, 2,2-dimethyl-cyclobutyl, 2'ethyl-cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, and so on. In an embodiment of the invention the term -cycloalkyl- includes the groups described immediately above and further includes monocyclic unsaturated aliphatic hydrocarbon groups. For example, -cycloalkyi- as defined in this embodiment includes cyclopropyl, methyl-cyclopropyl, 2,2-dimethyl-cyclobutyl, 2-ethyl-cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, cyclopentenyl, cyclobutenyl and so on.<br>
Ihe term "alkylene- means a hydrocarbon diradical group having the specified number of carbon atoms. For example, -alkylene- includes - CH2-,<br>
-CH2CH2- and the like.<br>
When used in the phrases -C1-C6 aralkyl- and -C1-C6 heteroaralkyi- the term "C1-C6- refers to the alkyl portion of the moiety and does not describe the number of atoms in the aryl and heteroaryl portion of the moiety.<br>
-Alkoxy- represents either a cyclic or non-cyclic alkyl group of indicated number of carbon atoms attached through an oxygen bridge. -Alkoxy- therefore encompasses the definitions of alkyl and cycloalkyl above.<br><br>
If no number of carbon atoms is specified, the term -alkenyl- refers to a non-aromatic hydrocarbon radical, straight, branched or cyclic, containing from 2 to 10 carbon atoms and at least one carbon to carbon double bond. Preferably one carbon to carbon double bond is present, and up to four non-aromatic carbon-carbon double bonds may be present. Thus, -C2-C6 alkenyl- means an alkenyl radical having from 2<br>
to 6 carbon atoms. Alkenyl groups include ethenyl, propenyl, butenyl, 2-methylbutenyl and cyclohexenyl. The straight, branched or cyclic portion of the alkenyl group may contain double bonds and may be substituted if a substituted alkenyl group is indicated.<br>
The term -alkynyl- refers to a hydrocarbon radical straight, branched or cyclic, containing from 2 to 10 carbon atoms and at least one carbon to carbon triple bond. Up lo three carbon-carbon triple bonds may be present. Thus, -C2-C6 alkynyl- means an alkynyl radical having from 2 to 6 carbon atoms. Alkynyl groups include ethynyl, propynyl, butynyl, 3-methylbutynyl and so on. The straight, branched or cyclic portion of the alkynyl group may contain triple bonds and may be substituted if a substituted alkynyl group is indicated.<br>
In certain instances, substituents may be defined with a range of carbons that includes zero, such as (Co-C6)alkylene-aryl.    If aryl is taken to be phenyl, this<br>
definition    would    include    phenyl    itself   as   well    as   -CH2Ph,    -CH2CH2Ph,<br>
CM(CH3)CH2CH(CH3)Ph, and so on.<br>
As used herein, -aryl- is intended to mean any stable monocyclic or bicyclic carbon ring of up to 7 atoms in each ring, wherein at least one ring is aromatic, [examples of such aryl elements include phenyl, naphthyl, tetrahydronaphthyl, indanyl and biphenyl. In cases where the aryl substituent is bicyclic and one ring is non-aromatic, it is understood that attachment is via the aromatic ring.<br>
The term heteroaryl, as used herein, represents a stable monocyclic or bicyclic ring of up to 7 atoms in each ring, wherein at least one ring is aromatic and contains from I to 4 heteroatoms selected from the group consisting of O, N and S. Heteroaryl groups within the scope of this definition include but are not limited to: acridinyl, carbazolyl, cinnolinyl, quinoxalinyl, pyrrazolyl, indolyl, benzotriazolyl, furanyl, thienyl, bcn/othienyl, benzofuranyl, quinolinyl, isoquinolinyl, oxazolyl, isoxazolyl, indolyl, pyra/inyl, pyridazinyl, pyridinyl, pyrimidinyl, pyrrolyl, tetrahydroquinoline. As with the definition of heterocycle below, -heteroaryl- Is also understood to include the N-oxide derivative of any nitrogen-containing heteroaryl.   In cases where the heteroaryl<br><br>
substituent is bicyclic and one ring is non-aromatic or contains no heteroatoms, it is understood that attachment is via the aromatic ring or via the heteroatom containing ring, respectively.<br>
The term -heterocycle- or -heterocyclyl- as used herein is intended to mean a 3-to<br>
 10-membered aromatic or nonaromatic heterocycle containing from I to 4<br>
heteroatoms selected from the group consisting of O, N and S, and includes bicyclic<br>
groups. -Heterocyclyl- therefore includes the above mentioned heteroaryls, as well as<br>
dihydro and tetrathydro analogs thereof. Further examples of -heterocyclyl- include,<br>
but are not limited to the following: azetidinyl, benzoimidazolyl, benzofuranyl,<br>

Included in the instant invention is the free form of compounds of Formula I, as well as the pharmaceutically acceptable salts and stereoisomers thereof Some of the specific compounds exemplified herein are the protonated salts of amine compounds. The term -free form- refers to the amine compounds in non-salt form. The encompassed pharmaceutically acceptable salts not only include the salts exemplified for the specific compounds described herein, but also all the typical pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the free form of compounds of Formula I. The free form of the specific salt compounds described may be isolated using techniques known in the art. For example, the free form may be regenerated by treating the salt with a suitable dilute aqueous base solution such as dilute aqueous NaOH, potassium carbonate, ammonia and sodium bicarbonate. The free forms may differ from their respective salt forms somewhat in certain physical properties, such as solubility in polar solvents, but the acid and base salts are otherwise pharmaceutically equivalent to their respective free forms for purposes of the invention.<br>
The pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the instant compounds can be synthesized from the compounds of this invention which contain a basic or acidic moiety by conventional chemical methods. Generally, the salts of the basic compounds are prepared either by ion exchange chromatography or by reacting the free base with stoichiometric amounts or with an excess of the desired salt-forming inorganic or<br><br>
organic acid in a suitable solvent or vaR10us combinations of solvents. Similarly, the salts of the acidic compounds are formed by reactions with the appropriate inorganic or organic base.<br>
Thus, pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compounds of this invention include the conventional non-toxic salts of the compounds of this invention as formed by reacting a basic instant compound with an inorganic or organic acid. For example, conventional non-toxic salts include those derived from inorganic acids such as hydrochloric, hydrobromic, sulfuric, sulfamic, phosphoric, nitric and the like, as well as salts prepared from organic acids such as acetic, propionic, succinic, glycolic, stearic, lactic, malic, tartaric, citric, ascorbic, pamoic, maleic, hydroxymaleic, phenylacetic, glutamic, benzoic, salicylic, sulfanilic, 2-acetoxy-benzoic, fumaric, toluenesulfonic, methanesulfonic, ethane disulfonic, oxalic, isethionic, trifluoroacetic and the like.<br>
When the compound of the present invention is acidic, suitable 'pharmaceutically acceptable salts- refers to salts prepared form pharmaceutically acceptable non-toxic bases including inorganic bases and organic bases. Salts derived from inorganic bases include aluminum, ammonium, calcium, copper, ferric, ferrous, lithium, magnesium, manganic salts, manganous, potassium, sodium, zinc and the like. Particularly preferred are the ammonium, calcium, magnesium, potassium and sodium salts. Salts derived from pharmaceutically acceptable organic non-toxic bases include salts of primary, secondary and tertiary amines, substituted amines including naturally occurring substituted amines, cyclic amines and basic ion exchange resins, such as arginine, betaine caffeine, choline, N,N*-dibenzylethylenediamine, diethylamin, 2-diethylaminoethanol, 2-dimethylaminoethanol, ethanolamine, ethylenediamine, N-ethylmorpholine, N-elhylpiperidine, glucamine, glucosamine, histidine, hydrabamine, isopropylamine, lysine, methylglucamine, morpholine, piperazine, piperidine, polyamine resins, procaine, purines, theobromine, triethylamine, trimethylamine iripropylamine, tromethamine and the like. When the compound of the present invention is acidic, the term -free form- refers to the compound in its non-salt form, such that the acidic functionality is still protonated.<br>
Ihe preparation of the pharmaceutically acceptable salts described above and other typical pharmaceutically acceptable salts is more fully described by Berg et ai, 'Pharmaceutical Salts,- J: Pharm. ScL, 1977:66:1-19.<br>
It will also be noted that the compounds of the present invention may potentially be internal salts or zwitteR10ns, since under physiological conditions a deprotonated<br><br>
acidic moiety in the compound, such as a carboxyl group, may be anionic, and this electronic charge might then be balanced off internally against the cationic charge of a protonated or alkylated basic moiety, such as a quaternary nitrogen atom. An isolated compound having internally balance charges, and thus not associated with a intermolecular counteR10n, may also be considered the -free form- of a compound.<br>
The compounds of this invention may be prepared by employing reactions as shown in the following schemes, in addition to other standard manipulations that are known in the literature or exemplified in the experimental procedures. The illustrative schemes below, therefore, are not limited by the compounds listed or by any particular substituents employed for illustrative purposes. Substituent numbering as shown in the schemes does not necessarily correlate to that used in the claims and often, for clarity, a single substituent is shown attached to the compound where multiple substituents are allowed under the definitions of Formula I hereinabove.<br>
As shown in Scheme A, key dihydropyrrole intermediate A-4 may be obtained from readily available suitably substituted anilines and N-protected dihydropyrrole. Subsequent deprotection of the ring nitrogen allows functional-<br>
lization with appropriately substituted electrophiles, such as the dialkylcarbamoyl chloride illustrated to give the instant compound A-6. Scheme A-1 shows an alternative synthesis of the A-4 intermediate.<br>
As shown in Scheme B, use of a single phenyl pyrrole enantiomer having a suitably located hydroxyl moiety allows for the preparation of the enantiomerically pure intermediate B-5, which may then be deprotected and functionalized in a method analogous to that shown in Scheme A.<br>
Scheme C illustrates attachment of a suitably substituted amino acid residue to the intermediate A-5. The group R50 represents a substituent sidechain, preferably a sidechain of an amino acid.<br>
As illustrated in Schemes D and F, attachment of an amino carbonyl moiety to the dihydropyrrole ring nitrogen can also be accoplished by a two step synthesis, thereby allowing incorporation of a wide variety of substituted amines into the instant compounds.<br><br>
Scheme E illustrates the syntheses of compounds of the instant invention that incorporate both a phenylmoiety and an alkyl moiety on the 2-position of the dihydropyrrole ring.<br>
As illustrated in Scheme G, suitably substituted hydroxyalkylamides may also be prepared.<br>
Other R6 substituents may be incorporated into the instant compound as shown in Scheme H. Thus a suitable Grignard reagent may replace the aryl boronic acid that is utilized in Scheme B.<br>
A Su/uki coupling may also be employed to incorporate an R6 heteroaryl substituent, as illustrated in Scheme I. SCIIl-MEA<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
Utilities<br>
The compounds of the invention find use in a variety of applications. As will be appreciated by those in the art, mitosis may be altered in a variety of ways; that is, one can affect mitosis either by increasing or decreasing the activity of a component in the mitotic pathway. Stated differently, mitosis may be affected (e.g., disrupted) by disturbing equilibrium, either by inhibiting or activating certain components. Similar approaches may be used to alter meiosis.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the compounds of the invention are used to modulate mitotic spindle formation, thus causing prolonged cell cycle arrest in mitosis. By -modulate- herein is meant altering mitotic spindle formation, including increasing and decreasing spindle formation. By -mitotic spindle formation- herein is meant organization of microtubules into bipolar structures by mitotic kinesins. By -mitotic spindle dysfunction- herein is meant mitotic arrest and monopolar spindle formation.<br>
The compounds of the invention are useful to bind to and/or modulate the activity of a mitotic kinesin. In a preferred embodiment, the mitotic kinesin is a member of the bimC subfamily of mitotic kinesins (as described in U.S. Patent No. 6,284,480, column 5). In a further preferred embodiment, the mitotic kinesin is human KSP, although the activity of mitotic kinesins from other organisms may also be modulated by the compounds of the present invention. In this context, modulate means either increasing or decreasing spindle pole separation, causing malformation, i.e., splaying, of mitotic spindle poles, or otherwise causing morphological perturbation of the mitotic spindle. Also included within the definition of KSP for these purposes are variants and/or fragments of KSP. See PCT Publ. WO 01/31335: -Methods of Screening for Modulators of Cell Proliferation and Methods of Diagnosing Cell Proliferation States-, filed Oct. 27, 1999, hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. In addition, other mitotic kinesins may be inhibited by the compounds of the present invention.<br>
The compounds of the invention are used to treat cellular proliferation diseases. Disease states which can be treated by the methods and compositions provided herein include, but are not limited to, cancer (further discussed below), autoimmune disease, arthritis, graft rejection, inflammatory bowel disease, proliferation induced after medical procedures, including, but not limited to, surgery, angioplasty, and the like. It is<br><br>
appreciated that in some cases the cells may not be in a hyper- or hypoproliferation state (abnormal state) and still require treatment. For example, during wound healing, the cells may be proliferating -normally-, but proliferation enhancement may be desired. Similarly, as discussed above, in the agriculture arena, cells may be in a 'normal- state, but proliferation modulation may be desired to enhance a crop by directly enhancing growth of a crop, or by inhibiting the growth of a plant or organism which adversely affects the crop. Thus, in one embodiment, the invention herein includes application to cells or individuals afflicted or impending affliction with any one of these disorders or states.<br>

The compounds of this invention may be administered to mammals, preferably humans, either alone or, preferably, in combination with pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, excipients or diluents, in a pharmaceutical composition, according to standard pharmaceutical practice. The compounds can be administered orally or parenterally, including the intravenous, intramuscular, intraperitoneal, subcutaneous, rectal and topical routes of administration.<br>
As used herein, the term -composition- is intended to encompass a product comprising the specified ingredients in the specific amounts, as well as any product which results, directly or indirectly, from combination of the specific ingredients in the specified amounts.<br><br>
The pharmaceutical compositions containing the active ingredient may be in a form suitable for oral use, for example, as tablets, troches, lozenges, aqueous or oily suspensions, dispersible powders or granules, emulsions, hard or soft capsules, or syrups or elixirs. Compositions intended for oral use may be prepared according to any method known to the art for the manufacture of pharmaceutical compositions and such compositions may contain one or more agents selected from the group consisting of sweetening agents, flavoring agents, coloring agents and preserving agents in order to provide pharmaceutically elegant and palatable preparations. Tablets contain the active ingredient in admixture with non-toxic pharmaceutically acceptable excipients which are suitable for the manufacture of tablets. These excipients may be for example, inert diluents, such as calcium carbonate, sodium carbonate, lactose, calcium phosphate or sodium phosphate; granulating and disintegrating agents, for example, microcrystalline cellulose, sodium crosscarmellose, corn starch, or alginic acid; binding agents, for example starch, gelatin, polyvinyl-pyrrolidone or acacia, and lubricating agents, for example, magnesium stearate, stearic acid or talc. The tablets may be uncoated or they may be coated by known techniques to mask the unpleasant taste of the drug or delay disintegration and absorption in the gastrointestinal tract and thereby provide a sustained action over a longer peR10d. For example, a water soluble taste masking material such as hydroxypropyl-methylcellulose or hydroxypropylcellulose, or a time delay material such as ethyl cellulose, cellulose acetate buryrate may be employed.<br>
Formulations for oral use may also be presented as hard gelatin capsules wherein the active ingredient is mixed with an inert solid diluent, for example, calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate or kaolin, or as soft gelatin capsules wherein the active ingredient is mixed with water soluble carrier such as polyethyleneglycol or an oil medium, for example peanut oil, liquid paraffin, or olive oil.<br>
Aqueous suspensions contain the active material in admixture with excipients suitable for the manufacture of aqueous suspensions. Such excipients are suspending agents, for example sodium carboxymethylcellulose, methylcellulose, hydroxypropylmethyl-cellulose, sodium alginate, polyvinyl-pyrrolidone, gum iragacanth and gum acacia; dispersing or wetting agents may be a naturally-occurring phosphatide, for example lecithin, or condensation products of an alkylene oxide with fatty acids, for example polyoxyethylene stearate, or condensation products of ethylene oxide with long chain aliphatic alcohols, for example heptadecaethyleneoxycctanol, or condensation products of ethylene oxide with partial esters derived from fatty acids and<br><br>
a hexilol such as polyoxyethylene sorbitol monooleate, or condensation products of ethylene oxide with partial esters derived from fatty acids and hexitol anhydrides, for example polyethylene sorbitan monooleate. The aqueous suspensions may also contain one or more preservatives, for example ethyl, or n-propyl p-hydroxybenzoate, one or more coloring agents, one or more flavoring agents, and one or more sweetening agents, such as sucrose, saccharin or aspartame.<br>
Oily suspensions may be formulated by suspending the active ingredient in a vegetable oil, for example arachis oil, olive oil, sesame oil or coconut oil, or in mineral oil such as liquid paraffin. The oily suspensions may contain a thickening agent, for example beeswax, hard paraffin or cetyl alcohol. Sweetening agents such as those set forth above, and flavoring agents may be added to provide a palatable oral preparation. 1 hese compositions may be preserved by the addition of an anti-oxidant such as bulylated hydroxyanisol or alpha-tocopherol.<br>
Dispersible powders and granules suitable for preparation of an aqueous suspension by the addition of water provide the active ingredient in admixture with a dispersing or wetting agent, suspending agent and one or more preservatives. Suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents are exemplified by those already mentioned above. Additional excipients, for example sweetening, flavoring and coloring agents, may also be present. These compositions may be preserved by the addition of an anti-oxidant such as ascorbic acid.<br>
rhe pharmaceutical compositions of the invention may also be in the form of an oil-in-water emulsions. The oily phase may be a vegetable oil, for example olive oil or arachis oil, or a mineral oil, for example liquid paraffin or mixtures of these. Suitable emulsifying agents may be naturally occurring phosphatides, for example soy bean lecithin, and esters or partial esters derived from fatty acids and hexitol anhydrides, for example sorbitan monooleate, and condensation products of the said partial esters with ethylene oxide, for example polyoxyethylene sorbitan monooleate. The emulsions may also contain sweetening, flavoring agents, preservatives and antioxidants.<br>
Syrups and elixirs may be formulated with sweetening agents, for example glycerol, propylene glycol, sorbitol or sucrose. Such formulations may also contain a demulcent, a preservative, flavoring and coloring agents and antioxidant.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions may be in the form of a sterile injectable aqueous solutions. Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that may be employed are water. Ringer's solution and isotonic sodium chloride solution.<br><br>
Ihe sterile injectable preparation may also be a sterile injectable oil-in-water microemulsion where the active ingredient is dissolved in the oily phase. For example, the active ingredient may be first dissolved in a mixture of soybean oil and lecithin. The oil solution then introduced into a water and glycerol mixture and processed to form a microemulation.<br>
The injectable solutions or microemulsions may be introduced into a patient's blood stream by local bolus injection. Alternatively, it may be advantageous to administer the solution or microemulsion in such a way as to maintain a constant circulating concentration of the instant compound. In order to maintain such a constant concentration, a continuous intravenous delivery device may be utilized. An example of such a device is the Deltec CADD-PLUS'TM model 5400 intravenous pump.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions may be in the form of a sterile injectable aqueous or oleagenous suspension for intramuscular and subcutaneous administration. Ihis suspension may be formulated according to the known art using those suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents which have been mentioned above, fhe sterile injectable preparation may also be a sterile injectable solution or suspension in a non-toxic parenterally acceptable diluent or solvent, for example as a solution in 1,3-butane diol. In addition, sterile, fixed oils are conventionally employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose any bland fixed oil may be employed including synthetic mono- or diglycerides. In addition, fatty acids such as oleic acid find use in the preparation of injectables.<br>
Compounds of Formula I may also be administered in the form of suppositories for rectal administration of the drug. These compositions can be prepared by mixing the drug with a suitable non-irritating excipient which is solid at ordinary temperatures but liquid at the rectal temperature and will therefore melt in the rectum to release the drug. Such materials include cocoa butter, glycerinated gelatin, hydrogenated vegetable oils, mixtures of polyethylene glycols of vaR10us molecular weights and fatty acid esters of polyethylene glycol.<br>
For topical use, creams, ointments, jellies, solutions or suspensions, etc., containing the compound of Formula I are employed. (For purposes of this application, topical application shall include mouth washes and gargles.)<br>
The compounds for the present invention can be administered in intranasal form via topical use of suitable intranasal vehicles and delivery devices, or via transdermal routes, using those forms of transdermal skin patches well known to those of ordinary<br><br>
skill in the art. To be administered in the form of a transdermal delivery system, the dosage administration will, of course, be continuous rather than intermittent throughout the dosage regimen. Compounds of the present invention may also be delivered as a suppository employing bases such as cocoa butter, glycerinated gelatin, hydrogenated vegetable oils, mixtures of polyethylene glycols of vaR10us molecular weights and fatty acid esters of polyethylene glycol.<br>
When a compound according to this invention is administered into a human subject, the daily dosage will normally be determined by the prescribing physician with the dosage generally varying according to the age, weight, sex and response of the individual patient, as well as the severity of the patient's symptoms.<br>
In one exemplary application, a suitable amount of compound is administered to a mammal undergoing treatment for cancer. Administration occurs in an amount between about 0.1 mg/kg of body weight to about 60 mg/kg of body weight per day, preferably of between 0.5 mg/kg of body weight to about 40 mg/kg of body weight per day.<br>

The invention further comprises the use of the instant compounds in a method to screen for other compounds that bind to KSP. To employ the compounds of the invention in a method of screening for compounds that bind to KSP kinesin, the KSP is bound to a support, and a compound of the invention (which is a mitotic agent) is added to the assay. Alternatively, the compound of the invention is bound to the support and KSP is added. Classes of compounds among which novel binding agents may be sought include specific antibodies, non-natural binding agents identified in screens of chemical libraries, peptide analogs, etc. Of particular interest are screening assays for candidate agents that have a low toxicity for human cells. A wide variety of assays may be used for this purpose, including labeled in vitro protein-protein binding assays, electrophoretic mobility shift assays, immunoassays for protein binding, functional assays (phosphorylation assays, etc.) and the like.<br>
The determination of the binding of the mitotic agent to KSP may be done in a number of ways. In a preferred embodiment, the mitotic agent (the compound of the invention) is labeled, for example, with a fluorescent or radioactive moiety and binding determined directly. For example, this may be done by attaching all or a portion of KSP to a solid support, adding a labeled mitotic agent (for example a compound of the invention in which at least one atom has been replaced by a detectable isotope), washing off excess reagent, and determining whether the amount of the label is that<br><br>
present on the solid support. VaR10us blocking and washing steps may be utilized as is known in the art.<br>
By -labeled- herein is meant that the compound is either directly or indirectly labeled with a label which provides a detectable signal, e.g., radioisotope, fluorescent tag, enzyme, antibodies, particles such as magnetic particles, chemiluminescent tag, or specific binding molecules, etc. Specific binding molecules include pairs, such as biotin and streptavidin, digoxin and antidigoxin etc. For the specific-binding members, the complementary member would normally be labeled with a molecule which provides for detection, in accordance with known procedures, as outlined above. The label can directly or indirectly provide a detectable signal.<br>
In some embodiments, only one of the components is labeled. For example, the kincsin proteins may be labeled at tyrosine positions using I, or with fluorophores. Alternatively, more than one component may be labeled with different labels; using -I for the proteins, for example, and a fluorophor for the mitotic agents.<br>
Ihe compounds of the invention may also be used as competitors to screen for additional drug candidates. -Candidate bioactive agent- or -drug candidate- or grammatical equivalents as used herein describe any molecule, e.g., protein, oligopeptide, small organic molecule, polysaccharide, polynucleotide, etc., to be tested for bioactivity. They may be capable of directly or indirectly altering the cellular proliferation phenotype or the expression of a cellular proliferation sequence, including both nucleic acid sequences and protein sequences. In other cases, alteration of cellular proliferation protein binding and/or activity is screened. Screens of this sort may be performed either in the presence or absence of microtubules. In the case where protein binding or activity is screened, preferred embodiments exclude molecules already known to bind to that particular protein, for example, polymer structures such as microtubules, and energy sources such as ATP. Preferred embodiments of assays herein include candidate agents, which do not bind the cellular proliferation protein in its endogenous native state termed herein as -exogenous- agents. In another preferred embodiment, exogenous agents further exclude antibodies to KSP.<br>
Candidate agents can encompass numerous chemical classes, though typically ihey are organic molecules, preferably small organic compounds having a molecular weight of more than 100 and less than about 2,500 daltons. Candidate agents comprise functional groups necessary for structural interaction with proteins, particularly hydrogen bonding and lipophilic binding, and typically include at least an amine.<br><br>
carbonyl, hydroxyl, ether, or carboxyl group, preferably at least two of the functional chemical groups. The candidate agents often comprise cyclical carbon or heterocyclic structures and/or aromatic or polyaromatic structures substituted with one or more of the above functional groups. Candidate agents are also found among biomolecules including peptides, saccharides, fatty acids, steroids, purines, pyrimidines, derivatives, structural analogs or combinations thereof Particularly preferred are peptides.<br>
Candidate agents are obtained from a wide variety of sources including libraries of synthetic or natural compounds. For example, numerous means are available for random and directed synthesis of a wide variety of organic compounds and biomolecules, including expression of randomized oligonucleotides. Alternatively, libraries of natural compounds in the form of bacterial, fungal, plant and animal extracts are available or readily produced. Additionally, natural or synthetically produced libraries and compounds are readily modified through conventional chemical, physical and biochemical means. Known pharmacological agents may be subjected to directed or random chemical modifications, such as acylation, alkylation, esterification, amidification to produce structural analogs.<br>
Competitive screening assays may be done by combining KSP and a drug candidate in a first sample. A second sample comprises a mitotic agent, KSP and a drug candidate. This may be performed in either the presence or absence of microtubules. The binding of the drug candidate is determined for both samples, and a change, or difference in binding between the two samples indicates the presence of an agent capable of binding to KSP and potentially modulating its activity. That is, if the binding of the drug candidate is different in the second sample relative to the first sample, the drug candidate is capable of binding to KSP.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the binding of the candidate agent is determined through the use of competitive binding assays. In this embodiment, the competitor is a binding moiety known to bind to KSP, such as an antibody, peptide, binding partner, ligand, etc. Under certain circumstances, there may be competitive binding as between the candidate agent and the binding moiety, with the binding moiety displacing the candidate agent.<br>
In one embodiment, the candidate agent is labeled. Either the candidate agent, or the competitor, or both, is added first to KSP for a time sufficient to allow binding, if present. Incubations may be performed at any temperature which facilitates optimal activity, typically between about 4 and about 40°C.<br><br>
incubation peR10ds are selected for optimum activity, but may also be optimized to facilitate rapid high throughput screening. Typically between 0.1 and 1 hour will be sufficient. Excess reagent is generally removed or washed away. The second component is then added, and the presence or absence of the labeled component is followed, to indicate binding.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the competitor is added first, followed by the candidate agent. Displacement of the competitor is an indication the candidate agent is binding to KSP and thus is capable of binding to, and potentially modulating, the activity of KSP. In this embodiment, either component can be labeled. Thus, for example, if the competitor is labeled, the presence of label in the wash solution indicates displacement by the agent. Alternatively, if the candidate agent is labeled, the presence of the label on the support indicates displacement.<br>
In an alternative embodiment, the candidate agent is added first, with incubation and washing, followed by the competitor. The absence of binding by the competitor may indicate the candidate agent is bound to KSP with a higher affinity. Thus, if the candidate agent is labeled, the presence of the label on the support, coupled with a lack of competitor binding, may indicate the candidate agent is capable of binding to KSP.<br>
It may be of value to identify the binding site of KSP. This can be done in a variety of ways. In one embodiment, once KSP has been identified as binding to the mitotic agent, KSP is fragmented or modified and the assays repeated to identify the necessary components for binding.<br>
Modulation is tested by screening for candidate agents capable of modulating the activity of KSP comprising the steps of combining a candidate agent with KSP, as above, and determining an alteration in the biological activity of KSP. Thus, in this embodiment, the candidate agent should both bind to KSP (although this may not be necessary), and alter its biological or biochemical activity as defined herein. The methods include both in vitro screening methods and in vivo screening of cells for alterations in cell cycle distribution, cell viability, or for the presence, morphology, activity, distribution, or amount of mitotic spindles, as are generally outlined above.<br>
Alternatively, differential screening may be used to identify drug candidates that bind to the native KSP, but cannot bind to modified KSP.<br>
Positive controls and negative controls may be used in the assays. Preferably all control and test samples are performed in at least triplicate to obtain statistically significant results. Incubation of all samples is for a time sufficient for the binding of<br><br>
the agent to the protein. F'ollowing incubation, all samples are washed free of non-specidcally bound material and the amount of bound, generally labeled agent determined. For example, where a radiolabel is employed, the samples may be counted in a scintillation counter to determine the amount of bound compound.<br>
A variety of other reagents may be included in the screening assays. These include reagents like salts, neutral proteins, e.g., albumin, detergents, etc which may be used to facilitate optimal protein-protein binding and/or reduce non-specific or background interactions.

I.	Kinesin ATPase In Vitro Assay<br>
Cloning and expression of human poly-histidine tagged KSP motor domain<br>
(KSP(367H))<br>
Plasmids for the expression of the human KSP motor domain construct were cloned by PCR using a pBluescript full length human KSP construct (Blangy et al., Cell, vol.83, ppl 159-1169, 1995) as atemplate. The N-terminal primer S'-GCAACGATTAAIATGGCGTCGCAGCCAAATTCGTCTGCGAAG (SliO.lD.NO.:   1) and the C-terminal primer    5'-GCAACGCTCGAGTCAGTGAT GAlGGrGGIGArGCTGATTCACTTCAGGCTTATTCAATAT (SEQ.ID.NO.: 2) were used to amplify the motor domain and the neck linker region. The PCR products were digested with Asel and Xhol, ligated into the Ndel/Xhol digestion product of pRSl-la (Invitrogen) and transformed into E. coli BL21 (DE3).<br><br>
Cells were grown at 37°C to an OD600  of 0.5. After cooling the culture to room temperature expression of KSP was induced with 100μM IPTG and incubation was continued overnight.  Cells were pelleted by centrifugation and washed once with ice-cold PBS. Pellets were flash-frozen and stored -80°C. Protein Purification<br>
Cell pellets were thawed on ice and resuspended in lysis buffer (50mM K-HEPES, pH 8.0, 250mM KCl, 0.1% Tween, lOmM imidazole, 0.5mM Mg-ATP, ImM PMSF, 2mM benzimidine, Ix complete protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche)). Cell suspensions were incubated with Img/ml lysozyme and 5mM p-mercaptoethanol on ice for 10 minutes, followed by sonication (3x 30sec). All subsequent procedures were performed at 4°C. Lysates were centrifuged at 40,000x g for 40 minutes. Supernatants were diluted and loaded onto an SP Sepharose column (Pharmacia, 5ml cartridge) in buffer A (50mM K-HEPES, pH 6.8, ImM MgCb, ImM EGTA, 10)iM Mg-ATP, ImM DIT) and eluted with a 0 to 750mM KCl gradient in buffer A. Fractions containing KSP were pooled and incubated with Ni-NTA resin (Qiagen) for one hour. The resin was washed three times with buffer B (Lysis buffer minus PMSF and protease inhibitor cocktail), followed by three 15-minute incubations and washes with buffer B. Finally, the resin was incubated and washed for 15 minutes three times with buffer C (same as buffer B except for pH 6.0) and poured into a column. KSP was eluted with elution buffer (identical to buffer B except for 150mM KCl and 250mM imidazole). KSP-containing fractions were pooled, made 10% in sucrose, and stored at -80'C.<br>
Microtubules are prepared from tubulin Isolated from bovine brain. Purified tubulin (&gt; 97% MAP-free) at 1 mg/ml is polymerized at 37oC in the presence of 10 μM paclitaxel, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM GTP in BRB80 buffer (80 mM K-PIPES, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM MgCl2 at pH 6.8). The resulting microtubules are separated from non-polymerized tubulin by ultracentrifugation and removal of the supernatant. The pellet, containing the microtubules, is gently resuspended in 10μM paclitaxel, 1 mM DTT, 50<br>
μg/ml ampicillin, and 5μg/ml chloramphenicol in BRB80.<br>
The kinesin motor domain is incubated with microtubules, 1 mM ATP (1:1 MgCb: Na-ATP), and compound at 23oC  in buffer containing 80 mM K-HEPES (pH 7.0), I mM EGTA, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM MgCl2, and 50 mM KCl.   The reaction is<br>
terminated by a 2-10 fold dilution with a final buffer composition of 80 mM HEPES and 50 mM EDTA (or, alternately, with a 1:1 addition of reaction volume to stop<br><br>
buffer(1.8M KCl and 50 mM EDTA)). Free phosphate from the ATP hydrolysis reaction is measured via a quinaldine red/ammonium molybdate assay by adding a 1.5 times volume of quench C (e.g., to a mixture of 40 μl reaction volume + 40 \xl stop buffer is then added 120 μl quench C). Quench A contains 0.1 mg/ml quinaldine red and 0,14% polyvinyl alcohol; quench B contains 12.3 mM ammonium molybdate tetrahydrate in 1.15 M sulfuric acid. Quench C is a 2:1 ratio of quench Arquench B The<br>
reaction is incubated for 5-10 minutes at 23°C, and the absorbance of the phospho-molybdate complex is measured at 540 nm.<br>

11.        Cell Proliferation Assay<br>
Cells are plated in 96-well tissue culture dishes at densities that allow for logarithmic growth over the course of 24, 48, and 72 hours and allowed to adhere overnight. The following day, compounds are added in a 10-point, one-half log titration to all plates. Each titration series is performed in triplicate, and a constant DMSO concentration of 0.1% is maintained throughout the assay. Controls of 0.1% DMSO alone are also included. Each compound dilution series is made in media without scrum. Ihe final concentration of serum in the assay is 5% in a 200 )j,L volume of media. Twenty microliters of Alamar blue staining reagent is added to each sample and control well on the titration plate at 24, 48, or 72 hours following the addition of drug and returned to incubation at 37°C. Alamar blue fluorescence is analyzed 6-12 hours later on a CytoFluor II plate reader using 530-560 nanometer wavelength excitation, 590 nanometer emission.<br>
A cytotoxic EC50 is derived by plotting compound concentration on the x-axis<br>
and average percent inhibition of cell growth for each titration point on the y-axis. Growth of cells in control wells that have been treated with vehicle alone is defined as 100% growth for the assay, and the growth of cells treated with compounds is compared to this value. Proprietary in-house software is used to calculate percent<br><br>
cytotoxicity values and  inflection points using logistic 4-parameter curve fitting.<br>
Percent cytotoxicity is defined as:<br>
% cytotoxicity:(Fluorescencecontroi) ~ (Flourescencsample) x100x (Fluorescencecontroi)-The inflection point is reported as the cytotoxic EC50.<br>
IIL       Evaluation of mitotic arrest and apoptosis by FACS<br>
FACS analysis is used to evaluate the ability of a compound to arrest cells in mitosis and to induce apoptosis by measuring DNA content in a treated population of<br>
cells. Cells are seeded at a density of 1.4xl06 cells per 6cm2 tissue culture dish and allowed to adhere overnight. Cells are then treated with vehicle (0.1% DMSO) or a titration series of compound for 8-16 hours. Following treatment, cells are harvested by trypsinization at the indicated times and pelleted by centrifugation. Cell pellets are rinsed in PBS and fixed in 70% ethanol and stored at 4°C overnight or longer.<br>
For FACS analysis, at least 500,000 fixed cells are pelleted and the 70% ethanol is removed by aspiration. Cells are then incubated for 30 min at 4°C with RNase A (50 Kunit/ units/ml) and propidium iodide (50 μg/ml), and analyzed using a Becton Dickinson FACSCaliber. Data (from 10,000 cells) is analyzed using the Modfit cell cycle analysis modeling software (Verity Inc.).<br>
An BC30 for mitotic arrest is derived by plotting compound concentration on the x-axis and percentage of cells in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle for each titration point (as measured by propidium iodide fluorescence) on the y-axis. Data analysis is performed using the SigmaPlot program to calculate an inflection point using logistic 4-paramctcr curve fitting. The inflection point is reported as the EC50 for mitotic arrest. A similar method is used to determine the compound EC50 for apoptosis. Here, the<br>
percentage of apoptotic cells at each titration point (as determined by propidium iodide<br>
fiuorcscence) is plotted on the y-axis, and a similar analysis is carried out as described<br>
above.<br>
VI.       Immunofluorescence Microscopy to Detect Monopolar Spindles<br>
Methods for immunofluorescence staining of DNA, tubulin, and pericentrin are essentially as described in Kapoor et al. (2000) J. Cell Biol. 150: 975-988. For cell culture studies, cells are plated on tissue culture treated glass chamber slides and allowed to adhere overnight. Cells are then incubated with the compound of interest for 4 to 16 hours. After Incubation is complete, media and drug are aspirated and the chamber and gasket are removed from the glass slide. Cells are then permeabilized, fixed,  washed,   and  blocked  for  nonspecific  antibody binding  according to  the<br><br>
referenced protocol. Paraffin-embedded tumor sections are deparaffinized with xylene and rehydrated through an ethanol series pR10r to blocking. Slides are incubated in primary antibodies (mouse monoclonal anti-! -tubulin antibody, clone DMIA from Sigma diluted 1:500; rabbit polyclonal anti-pericentrin antibody from Covance, diluted 1:2000) overnight at 4°C. After washing, slides are incubated with conjugated secondary antibodies (FITC-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG for tubulin; Texas red-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG for pericentrin) diluted to 15μg/ml for one hour at room temperature. Slides are then washed and counterstained with Hoechst 33342 to visualize DNA. Immunostained samples are imaged with a 100x oil immersion objective on a Nikon epifluorescence microscope using Metamorph deconvolution and imaging software. HXAMPLHS<br>
