				<td>Pharmaceutical compositions<br>
The present invention relates to the use of Schulpen of<br>
pyrogenic silicic acid in pharmaceutical compositions. The<br>
Schulpen are used in this connection in particular as<br>
glidants to improve the bulk flow of powders.<br>
In a medicament it is generally possible to distinguish two<br>
functionally different substance groups, namely active<br>
ingredients and auxiliary substances.<br>
Active ingredients are characterised by their specific<br>
pharmacological activity. They represent the active<br>
constituent of a medicament. As such, they are also<br>
identified quantitatively on the packaging and on the<br>
package leaflet.<br>
Auxiliary substances, on the other hand, have no<br>
pharmacological activity. They are necessary in order to<br>
enable a suitable form of administration, namely the<br>
medicament, to be produced for the active ingredient. In<br>
general, the medicament contains a plurality of auxiliary<br>
substances having different functions. For example,<br>
auxiliary substances are used as fillers, binders,<br>
disintegrators, glidants, lubricants or release agents.<br>
When developing stable, effective medicaments which are<br>
easy to handle from active ingredient(s) and auxiliary<br>
substances, there are a large number of auxiliary substances which can be used.<br>
Highly disperse, pyrogenic silicon dioxide, for example<br>
Aerosil", is frequently used in pharmaceutical and cosmetic<br>
compositions. In solid product forms it can be used as a<br>
flow regulator, adsorbent and drying agent; in liquid and .<br>
semi-liquid product forms it can be used as a suspension<br>
stabiliser, framework-forming agent and gel-forming agent.<br>
It can also be used to increase the mechanical stability<br><br>
and the rate of disintegration of tablets. In addition, it<br>
can improve the distribution of the active ingredient.<br>
A particular disadvantage when working with highly disperse<br>
silicon dioxide is the formation of dust, because very high<br>
demands have to be met in terms of cleanliness when<br>
producing pharmaceutical and cosmetic products.<br>
A further disadvantage is the agglomeration behaviour of<br>
highly disperse silicon dioxide, which causes the product<br>
to come together as a result of hydrogen bridges and<br>
electrostatic charging. This results in larger lumps which<br>
do not pass through the relatively small sieve openings<br>
typical for the pharmaceutical industry. This is a<br>
particular problem in the case of silicon dioxides which<br>
have been compressed in order to minimise dust formation<br>
and have a higher bulk and tamped density.<br>
Sieving is very important in order to eliminate foreign<br>
bodies in pharmaceutical products. As a result, modern<br>
automatic weighing and screening devices cannot be used,<br>
which increases the possibility of contamination from human<br>
handling.<br>
When using highly dispersed silicon dioxide in<br>
pharmaceutical compositions improved flowability of<br>
mixtures prepared therewith would also be desirable in<br>
order to be able to achieve greater metering accuracy, for<br>
example when producing tablets and capsules. As a result it<br>
would be possible on the one hand to achieve lower variance<br>
of tablet and capsule weights and on the other hand to<br>
improve the economy of processes that result in such forms<br>
of administration.<br>
The object of the present invention is to provide<br>
pharmaceutical compositions which avoid the disadvantages<br>
of the prior art.<br><br>
The object is achieved by producing and using<br>
pharmaceutical compositions which contain Schulpen of<br>
pyrogenic silicon dioxide as auxiliary substance and which<br>
have a low dust content and at the same time can readily be<br>
sieved.<br>
It has been found that, when working with the compositions<br>
according to the invention, almost no dust formation<br>
occurs, the Schulpen can readily be sieved and are not<br>
retained on the surface of the sieve, and the flowability<br>
of the compositions is equally as good as that of<br>
compositions according to the prior art. In addition, the<br>
mechanical stability of tablets is ensured, and even<br>
abrasion in the tablet-forming machine is reduced compared<br>
with the prior art.<br>
The Schulpen of pyrogenic silicon dioxide as auxiliary<br>
substance are preferably present in the composition<br>
according to the invention in an amount of from 0.1 to<br>
10 wt.%.<br>
The composition according to the invention can additionally<br>
contain conventional auxiliary substances used in pharmacy,<br>
such as, for example, fillers such as carbohydrates, sugar<br>
alcohols, starches and starch derivatives; binders, such<br>
as, for example, gelatin, cellulose, polyvinylpyrrolidone<br>
derivatives; disintegrators, such as, for example, carboxy-<br>
methylcellulose, maize starch and sodium carboxymethyl<br>
starch; glidants, such as, for example, talcum or<br>
polyethylene glycols; lubricants and release agents, such<br>
as, for example, magnesium or calcium stearate or stearic<br>
acid.<br>
Processes for the production of pyrogenic silicon dioxide<br>
are to be found, for example, in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of<br>
Industrial Chemistry, Vol. A23, page 635 ff, 5th edition,<br>
1993.<br><br>
By subsequent treatment with a surface-modifying reagent it<br>
is also possible for the silicon dioxide to acquire a<br>
surface that- has been rendered partially or completely<br>
hydrophobic. Processes relating thereto are to be found,<br>
for example, in DE-A 11 63 784, DE-A 196 16 781, DE-A<br>
197 57 210 or DE-A 44 02 370.<br>
It is possible to use for the compositions according to the<br>
invention also mixtures of pyrogenic silicon dioxide with<br>
doped silicon dioxide having an SiO2 content of 90%, with<br>
mixed oxides having an SiO2 content of 90% or more and/or<br>
silicon dioxide that has been rendered hydrophobic.<br>
The subject of the invention is the use of Schulpen based<br>
on pyrogenically produced silicon dioxide in a<br>
pharmaceutical composition.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, the pyrogenically<br>
produced silicon dioxide compacted to form Schulpen can<br>
have a tamped density (according to DIN EN ISO 787-11) of<br>
from 185 to 700 g/1.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the tamped<br>
density (according to DIN EN ISO 787-11) can be from 200 to<br>
450 g/1.<br>
Schulpen refers to the more or less band-like intermediates<br>
that are formed during roller compaction by pressing of the<br>
starting material. They are comminuted in a second step.<br>
The properties of the Schulpen can be influenced by the<br>
procedural parameter, such as the permitted mode of process<br>
control, the compaction force, the width of the gap between<br>
the two rollers and the pressure maintenance time, which is<br>
adjusted by appropriately changing the speeds of rotation<br>
of the press rollers.<br>
Compaction is understood as meaning mechanical compression<br>
without the addition of binders. In a particular embodiment<br><br>
of the invention, the Schulpen have a defined shape,<br>
whereby the size distribution can be adjusted by means of<br>
sieving.<br>
The pyrogenically produced silicon dioxide compacted to form Schulpen that is used according to the invention has<br>
high stability to transportation.<br>
The pyrogenically produced silicon dioxide compacted to<br>
form Schulpen and having a tamped density (according to DIN<br>
EN ISO 787-11) of from 185 to 700 g/1 can be produced by<br>
subjecting pyrogenically produced silicon dioxide to<br>
preliminary de-aeration, or pre-compression, compacting it<br>
to form Schulpen, breaking the Schulpen and optionally<br>
grading them.<br>
A diagrammatic representation of the process is shown in Figure 1.<br>
According to Figure 1, the pyrogenically produced silicon<br>
dioxide is de-aerated, or pre-compressed, in the<br>
"preliminary de-aeration" step by means of known methods.<br>
This step is necessary when an uncompressed pyrogenically<br>
produced, optionally freshly produced, silicon dioxide is<br>
used.<br>
If a pyrogenically produced silicon dioxide that has<br>
already been pre-compressed is used, the step of<br>
preliminary de-aeration can be omitted.<br>
The pyrogenically produced silicon dioxide that has been<br>
subjected to preliminary de-aeration is compressed<br>
(compacted) to the desired tamped density in the<br>
"compaction" step.<br>
After compaction, the Schulpen are broken. They can then be<br>
graded or sieved, if desired.<br><br>
The fines content obtained during sieving can be fed back<br>
to the preliminary de-aeration step.<br>
The starting material used in the preliminary de-aeration<br>
can be either an uncompressed or a pre-compressed silicon<br>
dioxide.<br>
Preliminary de-aeration can be carried out either before<br>
transportation or during transportation to the compaction<br>
step.<br>
Before transportation to the compaction step, preliminary<br>
de-aeration can be carried out by means of a pipe of a<br>
sintered material, such as, for example, sintered metal, to<br>
which a vacuum is applied.<br>
Preliminary de-aeration can also take place in the screw<br>
conveyor, it being possible for the screw conveyor to be<br>
located downstream of the device comprising a pipe to which<br>
a vacuum is applied.<br>
In a further emdodiment, the screw conveyor can be used as<br>
the only device for preliminary de-aeration.<br>
It is further possible for preliminary de-aeration to be<br>
carried out by means of a screw conveyor that is arranged<br>
inside a pipe to which a vacuum is applied. The pipe to<br>
which a vacuum is applied can consist of a sintered jacket,<br>
such as, for example, sintered metal.<br>
When the device consists of a preliminary de-aeration pipe,<br>
for example a pipe to which a vacuum is applied, and a<br>
screw conveyor located downstream, the preliminary de-<br>
aeration can take place in the pipe if uncompressed silicon<br>
dioxide is used.<br>
If pre-compressed silicon dioxide is used, preliminary de-<br>
aeration can likewise take place in the pipe. It is also<br><br>
possible to dispense with this preliminary de-aeration<br>
step.<br>
If only the screw conveyor is used for the preliminary de-<br>
aeration, pre-compressed silicon dioxide must be used.<br>
If preliminary de-aeration is carried out using the device<br>
comprising a screw, conveyor inside a pipe to which a vacuum<br>
is applied, it is possible to use both uncompressed silicon<br>
dioxide and pre-compressed silicon dioxide.<br>
Preliminary de-aeration of the pyrogenically produced<br>
silicon dioxide can further be carried out by means of<br>
filtration on a filter medium, such as, for example, a<br>
cloth or sintered material, such as, for example, sintered<br>
metal, sintered plastics material, sintered ceramics,<br>
porous glass, with continuous removal of the filter cake<br>
by, for example, a screw conveyor or a scraper. In an<br>
embodiment of the invention it is possible to use a<br>
sintered metal pipe with a metering screw.<br>
Preliminary de-aeration can also be carried out by means of<br>
sedimentation, the breaking up of solids bridges being<br>
assisted by superimposed vibration, sound or slow stirring.<br>
As starting material there can be used a hydrophilic<br>
pyrogenically produced silicon dioxide or a hydrophobic<br>
pyrogenically produced silicon dioxide.<br>
Hydrophobic pyrogenically produced silicon dioxide can be<br>
produced by means of surface modification.<br>
Surface modification can be effected using one or more<br>
compounds from the following group:<br>

In an embodiment it is possible to use as starting material<br>
a pre-compressed pyrogenically produced silicon dioxide.<br>
The uncompressed pyrogenically produced silicon dioxide<br>
that is used can have a tamped density (according to DIN EN<br>
ISO 787-11) of less than 50 g/1, preferably from 20 to<br>
30 g/1. The pre-compressed pyrogenically produced silicon<br>
dioxide that is used can have a tamped density (according<br>
to DIN EN ISO 787-11) of from 50 to 190 g/1, preferably<br>
from 100 to 150 g/1, wherein the tamped density (according<br>
to DIN EN ISO 787-11) in the case of a pre-compressed<br>
hydrophobic pyrogenically produced silicon dioxide can be<br>
from 90 to 120 g/1.<br>
The hydrophilic silicon dioxide that is used can have a<br>
tamped density (according to DIN EN ISO 787-11) of less<br>
than 50 g/1, preferably from 20 to 30 g/1, in the<br>
uncompressed state.<br>
In the pre-compressed state, the hydrophilic silicon<br>
dioxide can have a tamped density (according to DIN EN ISO<br>
787-11) of from 50 to 190 g/1, preferably from 100 to<br>
150 g/1.<br>
In the pre-compressed state, the hydrophobic silicon<br>
dioxide can have a tamped density (according to DIN EN ISO<br>
787-11) of from 50 to 190 g/1, preferably from 90 to<br>
120 g/1.<br>
The pyrogenically produced silicon dioxide that is used can<br>
have a primary particle size of from 5 to 50 nm and a BET<br>
surface area of from 40 to 400 m2/g, preferably from 100 to<br>
250 m2/g.<br>
The water content of the pyrogenically produced silicon<br>
dioxide that is used can be less than 1 wt. %.<br><br>
The pyrogenically produced silicon dioxide can be pre-<br>
compressed by means of known methods and devices. For<br>
example, the devices according to US 4,325,686, US<br>
4,877,595, US 3,838,785, US 3,742,566, US 3,762,851, US<br>
3,860,682 can be used.<br>
In an embodiment, it is possible to use a pyrogenically<br>
produced silicon dioxide that has been pre-compressed by<br>
means of a press band filter according to EP 0280851 Bl or<br>
US 4,877,595.<br>
The pyrogenically produced Silicon dioxide can be<br>
transported to the compaction step by means of a screw, for<br>
example.<br>
This transport represents the forced guiding of the<br>
pyrogenically produced silicon dioxide into the roller gap<br>
of the compacting rollers. If a screw conveyor is not used,<br>
a pre-compressed pyrogenically produced silicon dioxide<br>
must be employed.<br>
If a screw conveyor is used, the pyrogenically produced<br>
silicon dioxide does not have to be pre-compressed because<br>
preliminary de-aeration takes place therein.<br>
In order to achieve high bulk weights of the -Schulpen it is<br>
possible to use a screw conveyor and a pre-compressed<br>
pyrogenically produced silicon dioxide.<br>
The screw conveyor used can be a screw with decreasing<br>
volume or with increasing pitch or with decreasing<br>
diameter.<br>
The screw conveyor can be enclosed in a pipe to which a<br>
vacuum is applied. This pipe can consist of a sintered<br>
jacket. Preliminary de-aeration of the silicon dioxide here<br>
takes place in the screw conveyor at the same time as<br>
transportation into the roller gap.<br><br>
Compaction to Schulpen can be carried out by means of two<br>
rollers, one or both of which can at the same time have a<br>
de-aerating function.<br>
It is possible especially to use two compacting rollers,<br>
which can be smooth. They can also be profiled. The profile<br>
can be present either only on one compacting roller or on<br>
both compacting rollers.<br>
The profile can consist of axis-parallel ribs.<br>
Alternatively, it can be troughs (indentations) of any<br>
desired form in any desired arrangement.<br>
In a further embodiment, at least one of the rollers can be<br>
a vacuum roller. In this embodiment, the roller can be<br>
covered with sintered metal.<br>
In order to carry out the de-aeration function, the roller<br>
can be produced from sintered metal or be covered with a<br>
filter medium, such as, for example, with a cloth.<br>
If the pyrogenically produced silicon dioxide can be de-<br>
aerated by means of the rollers, it is possible to dispense<br>
with the additional preliminary de-aeration, which can take<br>
place in the screw conveyor or the feed pipe.<br>
If the roller is used for preliminary de-aeration, the<br>
roller can have a smooth or profiled surface, it being<br>
possible for the surface to be only slightly ribbed in<br>
order to improve product intake.<br>
During compaction, uniform compression of the pyrogenically<br>
produced silicon dioxide is to be ensured in order to<br>
obtain Schulpen of uniform density.<br>
A device as shown in Figure 2 can be used for carrying out<br>
the compaction.<br>
According to Figure 2, the pyrogenically produced silicon<br>
dioxide is introduced by means of the pre-compressor screw<br><br>
1 into the chamber 2 between the two rollers 3 and is<br>
compressed between the two rollers to form Schulpen.<br>
A device as described in document DE AS 1807714 can also be<br>
used for carrying out the process.<br>
During compaction, smooth rollers can preferably be used in<br>
order to avoid grit. It is further possible to use one or<br>
two rollers of sintered material, such as sintered metal or<br>
sintered ceramics, via which de-aeration can take place.<br>
After compaction, the Schulpen are broken. To this end<br>
there can be used a sieve granulator, which specifies the<br>
grain size by the mesh size of the sieve. The mesh size can -<br>
be from 250 µm to 20 mm.<br>
For breaking the Schulpen it is further possible to use a<br>
device having two rollers which rotate in opposite<br>
directions and have a defined gap between them, or a<br>
toothed roller.<br>
The broken Schulpen can be graded by means of a sifter, a<br>
sieve or a classifier. The fines content (particles smaller<br>
than 200 µm) can be separated off thereby.<br>
As sifters there can be used cross-flow sifters, counter-<br>
current deflecting sifters, etc.<br>
A cyclone can be used as classifier.<br>
The fines content (particles smaller than 200 µm) separated<br>
off during grading can be fed back into the process<br>
according to the invention.<br>
Determination of the dust content<br>
The dust content is determined according to DIN 55992-2.<br><br>
Prior to the measurement, a weighed amount of the Schulpen<br>
of the pyrogenically produced silicon dioxide to be tested<br>
is introduced into a feed system at the top end of the down<br>
pipe. This is closed at the bottom before the start of the<br>
measurement by flaps. The end of the down pipe is closed.<br>
At the start of the measurement, that flap is opened for a<br>
specific period of time so that the sample is able to fall<br>
into the down pipe. As it falls, and when it comes into<br>
contact with the bottom of the down pipe, the sample gives<br>
off dust into the air. The air currents during falling<br>
ensure that the dust is distributed uniformly in the pipe.<br>
The suspended material then begins to settle. At the bottom<br>
end of the down pipe, the light extinction caused by the<br>
suspended material is measured by a photometric sensor. The<br>
course of the sedimentation is indicated by a PC as a<br>
function of the time. In the case of the CIPACMT171 dust-<br>
measuring device, the extinction E (in %) is plotted<br>
directly as a function of the sedimentation time. In the<br>
case of the SP3 dust-measuring device from Lorenz, the dust<br>
number SZ is calculated according to the following formula<br>
(eq. 1) and plotted as a function of time.<br><br>
The dust number is a measure of the fine dust content of<br>
the sample. "Fine dust" here refers to the fraction whose<br>
rate of sedimentation in air is less than 1 m/16 s =<br>
0.0625 m/s.<br>
A diagrammatic representation of the device used to<br>
determine the dust content is shown in Figure 3.<br>
In Figure 4, the fine dust content of the pyrogenically<br>
produced silicon dioxide compacted to form Schulpen that is<br><br>
used according to the invention and the fine dust contents<br>
of pyrogenic silicon dioxide that has been compressed by a<br>
different method are compared.<br>
The starting material employed for the silicon dioxide used<br>
according to the invention was a pyrogenically produced<br>
silicon dioxide that had been compressed by means of the<br>
press band filter according to EP 0280851 Bl.<br>
Figure 4 shows a measure of the particle size distribution<br>
and the mean particle size of the bulk powder or Schulpen,<br>
which are used with the according to the invention. This<br>
demonstrates that the Schulpen of the pyrogenically<br>
produced silicon dioxide that are used according to the<br>
invention settle significantly better and form<br>
significantly less dust than the granules according to EP<br>
0 725037 A1.<br>
Figure 4 also shows a measure of the fine or suspended dust<br>
content. This demonstrates that the suspended dust content<br>
can be drastically reduced with the Schulpen used according<br>
to the invention. In the case of granules according to EP<br>
075 037 A1, a large proportion remains suspended for a long<br>
time .<br>
Figure 5 shows the combined distribution (Q-3 distribution)<br>
of various granules according to EP 0 725 037 A1, None of<br>
these granules exhibits a mean particle size of 120 urn.<br>
Only the largest particles in this group are from 96 to<br>
128 µm in size. This is less than 11 %.<br>
The Schulpen used according to the invention with<br>
X 
according to EP 0 725 037 Al in laser diffraction<br>
spectroscopy. In both cases it is ~ 35 µm.<br>
However, the Schulpen according to the invention produce<br>
significantly less dust.<br><br>
The fractions of the Schulpen were produced by sieve<br>
granulation using a sieve having a mesh size of 500 µm,<br>
with subsequent sieving on a 250 µm sieve. The fraction<br>
x 
fraction having a particle size of from 250 to 500 µm was<br>
the coarse material.<br>
Figure 6 shows the pyrogenically produced silicon dioxide<br>
compacted to form Schulpen that is used according to the<br>
invention, in its granular form after breaking and sieving.<br>
It has an angular shape.<br>
The granules according to DE 19601415 have a spherical<br>
appearance.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the Schulpen used according to<br>
the invention have a tamped density of from 200 to 300 g/1.<br>
Such Schulpen then have the necessary strength not to<br>
disintegrate again in the subsequent steps. However, they<br>
can readily be dispersed again.<br>
Furthermore, the Schulpen that are obtained are porous.<br>
The Schulpen used according to the invention have an<br>
advantageously low dust content after breaking even without<br>
sieving or grading.<br>
The Schulpen used according to the invention have an<br>
agglomerate hardness of less than 50 N, measured using an<br>
ERWEKA 30.<br>
After breaking, the Schulpen used according to the<br>
invention do not exhibit a further dust content. Even<br>
during handling, transportation or storage, no further dust<br>
content is formed with the Schulpen used according to the<br>
invention. The pyrogenically produced silicon dioxide<br>
compacted to form Schulpen does not exhibit a fines content<br>
having a diameter of less than 200 µm after sieving.<br><br>
The pyrogenically produced silicon dioxide compacted to<br>
form Schulpen that is used according to the invention has a<br>
low dust content that is advantageous for all applications.<br>
It can be added to the mixtures without loss and without<br>
introducing dust.<br>
The pyrogenically produced silicon dioxide compacted to<br>
form Schulpen does not contain binder.<br>
The silicon dioxide utilized in the invention is of the<br>
very fine particle size variety. In the most preferred<br>
embodiments of the invention, the silicon dioxide utilized<br>
is a colloidal silicon dioxide. Colloidal silicon dioxide<br>
is a submicron fumed silica prepared by the vapor-phase<br>
hydrolysis (e.g., at 1110° C.) of a silicon compound, such<br>
as silicon tetrachloride. The product itself is a<br>
submicron, fluffy, light, loose, bluish-white, odorless<br>
and tasteless amorphous powder which is commercially<br>
available from a number of sources, including Cabot<br>
Corporation (under the tradename Cab-OSil); Degussa, Inc.<br>
(under the tradename AEROSIL) ; E.1. DuPont &amp; Co.; and W.R.<br>
Grace &amp; Co. Colloidal silicon dioxide is also known as<br>
colloidal silica, fumed silica, light anhydrous silicic<br>
acid, silicic anhydride, and silicon dioxide fumed, among<br>
others. A variety of commercial grades of colloidal<br>
silicon dioxide are produced by varying the manufacturing<br>
process. These modifications do not affect the silica<br>
content, specific gravity, refractive index, color or<br>
amorphous form. However, these modifications are known to<br>
change the particle size, surface areas, and bulk<br>
densities of the colloidal silicon dioxide products.<br>
The surface area of the preferred dass of silicon dioxides<br>
utilized in the invention ranges from about 50 m2/gm to<br>
about 500 m2/gm. The average primary particle diameter of<br>
the preferred dass of silicon dioxides utilized in the<br>
invention ranges from about 5 nm to about 50 run. However,<br>
in commercial colloidal silicon dioxide products, these<br><br>
particles are agglomerated or aggregated to varying<br>
extents. The bulk density of the preferred dass of silicon<br>
dioxides' utilized in the invention ranges from about 20<br>
g/1 to about 100 g/1.<br>
Commercially available colloidal silicon dioxide products<br>
have, for example, a BET surface area ranging from about<br>
50+15 m2/gm (AEROSIL OX50) to about 400±20 (Cab-O-Sil S-17)<br>
or 390+40 m2/gm (cab-o-sil EH-5). Commercially available<br>
particle sizes range from a nominal particle diameter of 7<br>
nm (e.g., Cab-O-Sil S-17 or Cab-O-Sil EH-5) to an average<br>
primary particle size of 40 nm (AEROSIL OX50). The density<br>
of these products range from 72.0±8 g/1 (Cab-O-Sil S-17) to<br>
36.8 g/1 (e.g., Cab-O-Sil M-5). The pH of the these<br>
products at 4% aqueous dispersion ranges from pH 3.5-4.5.<br>
The pyrogenic silicon dioxide serving as starting material<br>
is produced by feeding a volatile silicon compound through a<br>
nozzle into a detonating gas flame of hydrogen and air.<br>
Silicon tetrachloride is used in most cases. This substance<br>
hydrolyses under the influence of the water produced in the<br>
detonating gas reaction, to form silicon dioxide and<br>
hydrochloric acid. After leaving the flame the silicon<br>
dioxide enters a so-called coagulation zone in which the<br>
silicon dioxide primary particles and primary aggregates<br>
agglomerate. The product present as a form of aerosol in this<br>
stage is separated from the gaseous accompanying substances<br>
in cyclones and is then post-treated with moist hot air. The<br>
residual hydrochloric acid content can be reduced to below<br>
0.025% by this process.<br>
The granular materials (Schulpen) based on pyrogenically<br>
produced silicon dioxide may also be silanised. The carbon<br>
content of the granular material is then preferably 0.3 to<br>
15.0 wt. %. Halogenated silantes, alkoxysilanes, silazanes<br>
and/or siloxanes may be used for the silanisation.<br><br>

octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane = D 4<br><br>
polysiloxanes and/or silicone oils of the type:<br><br><br>
The silanisation may be carried out by spraying the Schulpen with the silanisation agent, which may optionally<br>
be dissolved in an organic solvent, for example ethanol,<br>
and then thermally treating the mixture at a temperature<br>
of 105° to 400° C. for a period of 1 to 6 hours.<br>
An alternative method of silanising the Schulpen involves<br>
treating the Schulpen with the silanisation agent in<br>
vapour form and then thermally treating the mixture at a<br>
temperature of 200 to 800 C. for a period of 0.5 to 6<br>
hours. The thermal treatment may be carried out under a<br>
protective gas, such as for example nitrogen.<br>
The silanisation may be carried out continuously er<br>
batchwise in heatable mixers and dryers with spray<br>
devices. Suitable types of apparatus include for example<br>
ploughshare mixers, plate dryers, fluidised-bed dryers or<br>
turbulent-layer dryers.<br><br>
The physicochemical parameters Of the Schulpen, such as<br>
the specific surface, grain size distribution, pore<br>
volume, tamped density and silanol group concentration,<br>
pore distribution and pH value may be altered within the<br>
specified limits by varying the starting substances,<br>
spraying conditions, heat treatment and silanisation.<br>

(oestriol), antiplaque agents (e.g, chlorhexidine and salts<br>
thereof, octenidine, and mixtures of thymol, menthol,<br>
methysalicylate, eucalyptol), acidity reducing agents<br>
(e.g., buffering agents such as potassium phosphate lo<br>
dibasic, calcium carbonate, sodium bicarbonate, sodium and<br>
potassium hydroxide, etc.), and tooth desensitizers (e.g.,<br>
potassium nitrate). This list is not meant to be exclusive.<br>
The solid formulations of the invention may also include<br>
other locally active agents, such as flavorants and<br>
sweeteners. Generally any flavoring or food additive such<br>
as those described in Chemicals Used in Food Processing,<br>
pub 1274 by the National Academy of Sciences, pages 63-258<br>
may be used.<br>
A wide variety of pharmaceutically systemically active<br>
agents can be formulated e.g., vitamins, minerals, amino<br>
acids, essential trace elements, hormones and antagonists<br>
thereof, steroids, non-steroid anti-inflammatory agents,<br>
antineoplastic agents, antigens, antihistaminic agents,<br>
neuropharmacologic agents, including analgesics,<br>
vasodilators, anticoagulants, antimicrobial agents,<br>
antiviral agents, antifungal agents, antiparasitic agents,<br>
heavy metal antagonists, locally active drugs moderating<br>
the digestive tract, such as enzymes, antacids, histamine<br>
antagonists, diuretics and cardiovascular drugs.<br>
It is to be understood that the compositions of the<br>
invention may comprise more than one active drug substance,<br>
e.g. a combination of two or more drug substances. For<br>
example, a composition of the invention may comprise a<br>
therapeutic effective dose of drospirenone and a therapeu-<br>
tic effective dose of an estrogen.<br><br>
Further constituents of the pharmaceutical compositions<br>
according to the invention may include conventional<br>
auxiliary substances such as for example antioxidants,<br>
binders, emulsifiers, colouring agents, filmforming agents,<br>
fillers, odoriferous substances, flavouring 'substances,<br>
gelforming agents, preservatives, solvents, oils, powder<br>
bases, ointment bases, acids and salts for the formulation,<br>
replenishment and production of pharmaceutical<br>
compositions, lubricants, release agents, suppository<br>
bases, suspension stabilisers, sweetening agents,<br>
effervescent gases, emollients and sugar substitutes.<br>
Plant medicament preparations and homeopathic preparations<br>
are also included among the pharmaceutical compositions in<br>
which the silicon dioxide Schulpen may be used.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions according to the invention<br>
may also include socalled retard and depot dosage forms<br>
with controlled release of active constituent. Moreover<br>
the pharmaceutical compositions according to the invention<br>
may also be part of therapeutic systems such as for example<br>
therapeutic systems for topical application and<br>
transdermal therapeutic systems.<br>
In a preferred embodiment the silicon dioxide Schulpen<br>
based on pyrogenic silicic acid serves as a glidant for<br>
improving the flow of pharmaceutical active constituents<br>
and/or excipients and/or mixtures thereof. The present<br>
invention is accordingly also directed to a mixture of the<br>
aforedescribed silicon dioxide Schulpen and at least one of<br>
these substances.<br>
The compositions according to the invention can be used in<br>
the form of solid, semi-solid and liquid product forms.<br>
Solid product forms are, for example, powders, granules,<br>
tablets and filled capsules. Examples of semi-solid product<br>
forms are creams, ointments, gels, pastes and "soft" gel<br><br>
Capsules. Liquid product forms are, for example,<br>
suspensions. Further suitable product forms can be<br>
suppositories and aerosols, for example.<br>
The term "glidant" may also mean that silicon dioxide<br>
Schulpen or fragments thereof coat solid particles of<br>
the material. The forCGS Of attraction between the particles<br>
are reduced and for example the flow behaviour is improved.<br>
Schulpen formed from pyrogenic silicic acids Can in<br>
particular complement or replace the conventional pyrogenic<br>
silicic acids that have been established in pharmaceutical<br>
practice for many years. For example, Schulpen of pyrogenic<br>
silicic acids may above all improve the production and<br>
properties of solid medicament forms. Also, they may<br>
advantageously be employed in the production of extrudates<br>
and replace for example other established auxiliary<br>
substances such as cellulose or polymers.<br>
The advantages of the Schulpen based on pyrogenically<br>
produced silicon dioxide compared to the known non-<br>
granulated pyrogenic silicic acids lie above all in their<br>
non-agglomerating behaviour, improved flowability, narrower<br>
and definable particle size distribution, and dust-free<br>
handling. In addition tablets produced therefrom have<br>
mechanical stability and disintegration behaviour<br>
properties as do tablets prepared with conventional highly<br>
disperse pyrogenic silicic acid.<br>
The invention will now be described in more detail with the<br>
aid of examples.<br>
Here too, AEROSIL was first compacted to form Schulpen and<br>
then sieve granulated. The fine-material fraction of the<br>
subsequent sieving was used. The AEROSIL Schulpen grain<br>
size of this fine-material fraction is less than 250 µm.<br>
 Highly disperse pyrogenic silicic acids such as AEROSIL 200<br>
Pharma or AEROSIL 200 Pharma VV 120 are frequently used as<br><br>
flow regulators in the production of medicaments. By adding<br>
small amounts of AEROSIL, the flow behaviour of an active<br>
ingredient carrier or auxiliary substance can be increased<br>
and accordingly its application-related properties, such<br>
as, for example, its metering ability, can be improved,<br>
Avicel PH-101 is a frequently used microcrystalline<br>
cellulose whose flow behaviour is improved by addition of<br>
small amounts of AEROSIL 200 (e.g. 0.5 %). The sieving<br>
behaviour and, above all, the sieve residue of the mixture<br>
of Avicel and AEROSIL is an important application-related<br>
property. A large sieve residue means that automatic<br>
weighing, sieving and metering devices cannot be used. In<br>
order to test these granules for AEROSIL Schulpen in<br>
comparison with AEROSIL 200 Pharma and AEROSIL 200 Pharma<br>
VV 120, the sieve residue of the following mixtures was<br>
studied.<br>
•	Avicel® PH-101 without flow regulator (zero sample)<br>
•	Avicel® PH-101 99.5% + 0.5% AEROSIL® 200 Pharma<br>
•	Avicel® PH-101 99.5% + 0.5% AEROSIL® 200 VV Pharma<br>
•	Avicel® PH-101 99.5% + 0.5% AEROSIL® Schulpen 250<br>
(x 
The various components of the mixture were weighed directly<br>
onto a sieve having a mesh size of 0.71 mm. The mixture was<br>
first sieved through this sieve and thereby mixed slightly.<br>
The pulverulent mixtures were then mixed by means of a<br>
mixer (Turbula) at 46 rpm for a defined time (5, 10, 30,<br>
60 minutes.) . In general, agglomerates break up during<br>
mixing, as a result of which the sieving ability generally<br>
improves with the mixing time. After the times defined<br>
above, the powder was sieved through, a 0.315 mm sieve and<br>
the sieve residue was determined in wt.%. This is shown in Figure 8 as a function of the mixing time.<br><br>
While pure Avicel passes through the sieve completely, the<br>
agglomerates in the case of AEROSIL 200 VV 120 Pharma and<br>
AEROSIL 200 Pharma are broken up by the mixing process only<br>
with difficulty. The sieving ability is relatively poor as<br>
a result. AEROSIL 200 VV 120 is compressed on a vacuum<br>
press band filter to a tamped density of approximately<br>
120 g/1. However, the sieving behaviour worsens thereby.<br>
The AEROSIL Schulpen combine a good sieving and pouring<br>
ability with low dust formation. Accordingly, they have<br>
marked application-related advantages over AEROSIL 200<br>
Pharma and AEROSIL 200 VV 120 Pharma. Further<br>
characteristic values for assessing the flow properties of<br>
various auxiliary substances such as microcrystalline<br>
cellulose (Avicel PH-101, FMB Biopolymers), starch and<br>
lactose monohydrate (Tablettose from Meggle) are AEROSIL<br>
Schulpen slightly better or equally as good as in the case<br>
of AEROSIL 200 Pharma or AEROSIL 200 VV 120 Pharma.<br>
The AEROSIL Schulpen exhibit a significantly better<br>
activity as flow regulators than AEROPERL. The measurement<br>
is called angle of repose and is used to determine the flow<br>
properties of powders. The angle of repose values are as<br>
follows:<br>
Avicel alone: 4 6.7°<br>
Avicel + 1 % VP AEROPERL 300' Pharma: 4 6.7°<br>
Avicel + 1 % AEROSIL® Granulate 500 (250 <x :></x>
Avicel + 1 % AEROSIL® Granulate 250 (x
A difference of 3° in the angle of repose is regarded as<br>
significant. AEROPERL produces no improvement in the<br>
flowability compared with Avicel alone. The difference of<br>
almost 10° between AEROPERL and the AEROSIL Schulpen is an<br>
enormous improvement.<br><br>
