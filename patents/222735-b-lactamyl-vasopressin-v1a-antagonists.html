				<td>ß-LACTAMYL VASOPRESSIN V1a ANTAGONISTS<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to novel 2-(azetidin-2-on-l-yl)alkanedioic acid<br>
derivatives as vasopressin V1a receptor antagonists. The present invention also relates to<br>
methods of treating mammals in need of relief from disease states associated with and<br>
responsive to the antagonism of the vasopressin V1a receptor.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Vasopressin, a neurohypophyseal neuropeptide produced in the<br>
hypothalamus, is involved in water metabolism homeostasis, renal function, mediation of<br>
cardiovascular function, non-opioid mediation of tolerance for pain, and regulation of<br>
temperature in mammals. In addition to being released into the circulation via the posterior<br>
pituitary, vasopressin acts as a neurotransmitter in the brain. Three vasopressin receptor<br>
subtypes, designated V1a, V1b, and V2 have been identified. The human V1a receptor has<br>
been cloned (Thibonnier et al. The Journal of Biological Chemistry, 269(5), 3304-3310<br>
(1994)), and has been shown by radioligand binding techniques to be present in vascular<br>
smooth muscle cells, hepatocytes, blood platelets, lymphocytes and monocytes, type II<br>
pneumocytes, adrenal cortex, brain, reproductive organs, retinal epithelium, renal mesangial<br>
cells, and the AIO, A7r5, 3T3 and WRK-1 cell lines (Thibonnier, Neuroendocrinology of the<br>
Concepts in Neurosurgery Series 5, (Selman, W., ed), 19-30, Williams and Wilkins,<br>
Baltimore, (1993)).<br>
Structural modification of vasopressin has provided a number of vasopressin<br>
agonists (Sawyer, Pharmacol. Reviews, 13, 255 (1961)). In addition, several potent and<br>
selective vasopressin peptide antagonists have been designed (Lazslo et al,<br>
Pharmacological Reviews, 43, 73-108 (1991); Mah and Hofbauer, Drugs of the Future, 12,<br>
1055-1070 (1987); Manning and Sawyer, Trends in Neuroscience, 7, 8-9 (1984)). Their lack<br>
of oral bioavailability and short half-life, however, have limited the therapeutic potential of<br>
these analogs. While novel structural classes of non-peptidyl vasopressin V1a antagonists<br>
have been discovered (Yamamura et al, Science, 275, 572-574 (1991); Serradiel-Le Gal et<br>
al., Journal of Clinical Investigation, 92, 224-231 (1993); Serradiel-Le Gal et al,<br>
Biochemical Pharmacology, 47(4), 633-641 (1994)), a clinical candidate has yet to be<br>
identified.<br>
The general structural class of substituted 2-(azetidin-2-on-1-yl)acetic acid<br>
esters and amides are known as synthetic intermediates for the preparation of ß-lactam<br>
antibiotics (see e.g. U.S. Patent No. 4,751,299).<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
It has been found that certain coumpounds within the general class of 2-<br>
(azetidin-2-on-1-yl)alkanedioic acid derivatives elicit activity at the vasopressin Vla<br>
receptor. The present invention describes novel 2-(azetidin-2-on-1-yl)alkanedioic acid esters<br>
and amides useful for treating disease states that are associated with and responsive to<br>
antagonism of a vasopressin Vla receptor in a mammal.<br>
The invention also describes a method for treating a disease state responsive<br>
to the antagonism of a vasopressin V1a receptor, in a mammal in need of such treatment,<br>
comprising the step of administering to the mammal a pharmaceutically effective amount of<br>
such 2-(azetidin-2-on-1-yl)alkanedioic acid derivatives.<br>

The following Tables 1-5 are illustrative of compounds contemplated to be<br>
within the scope of the present invention.<br>
The compounds of the present invention are comprised of an azetidinone<br>
nucleus, said nucleus bearing asymmetric carbons at the 3- and 4-positions as illustrated<br>
by following structures:<br><br>
The compounds of the invention may, therefore, exist as single diastereomers, mixtures<br>
of diastereomers, or as a racemic mixture, all of which are useful and part of the<br>
invention. It is preferred that the azetidinone nucleus of the compounds of the invention<br>
exist in a single diastereomeric form. It is most preferred that the azetidinone nucleus<br>
exist as the (3S,4R)-diastereomer.<br>
It is appreciated that, except when A=A' and n=0, the carbon bearing R2 is<br>
also asymmetric. Furthermore, when R3 is 4-substituted oxazolidin-2-on-3-yl, the 4-<br>
position of that ring is asymmetric. In addition, when R3 is 2,5-disubstituted oxazolidin-<br>
4-on-3-yl or 1,2,5-trisubstituted imidazolidin-4-on-3-yl, the 2- and 5-carbons of those<br>
rings are asymmetric. Finally, when R3 is succinimido and one of R14 and R15 is<br>
hydrogen, the carbon bearing the non-hydrogen substituent is also asymmetric. While<br>
compounds possessing all combinations of stereochemical purity are contemplated by the<br>
present invention, it is appreciated that in many cases at least one of these chiral centers<br>
described above may be present in a single absolute configuration.<br>
The compounds of this invention are useful in methods for antagonism of<br>
the vasopressin V1a receptor. Such antagonism is useful in treating a variety of disorders<br>
that have been linked to this receptor in mammals. It is preferred that the mammal to be<br>
treated by the administration of compounds of this invention is human.<br>
Since certain of the compounds of this invention are amines, they are basic<br>
in nature and accordingly react with any of a number of inorganic and organic acids to<br>
form pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts. Because some of the free amines of<br>
the compounds of this invention are typically oils at room temperature, it is preferable to<br>
convert the free amines to their pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts for ease of<br>
handling and administration, since the latter are routinely solid at room temperature.<br>
Acids commonly employed to form such salts are inorganic acids such as hydrochloric<br>
acid, hydrobromic acid, hydroiodic acid, sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid, and the like, and<br>
organic acids, such as p-toluenesulfonic acid, methanesulfonic acid, oxalic acid,<br>
p-bromophenylsulfonic acid, carbonic acid, succinic acid, citric acid, benzoic acid, acetic<br>
acid, and the like. Examples of such pharmaceutically acceptable salts thus are the<br>
sulfate, pyrosulfate, bisulfate, sulfite, bisulfite, phosphate, monohydrogenphosphate,<br>
dihydrogenphosphate, metaphosphate, pyrophosphate, chloride, bromide, iodide, acetate,<br>
propionate, decanoate, caprylate, acrylate, formate, isobutyrate, caproate, heptanoate,<br>
propiolate, oxalate, malonate, succinate, suberate, sebacate, fumarate, maleate, butyne-<br>
1,4-dioate, hexyne-l,6-dioate, benzoate, chlorobenzoate, methylbenzoate,<br>
dinitrobenzoate, hydroxybenzoate, methoxybenzoate, phthalate, sulfonate,<br>
xylenesulfonate, phenylacetate, phenylpropionate, phenylbutyrate, citrate, lactate, ß-<br>
hydroxybutyrate, glycollate, tartrate, methanesulfonate, propanesulfonate, naphthalene-1-<br>
sulfonate, naphthalene-2-sulfonate, mandelate and the like. Preferred pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable salts are those formed with hydrochloric acid, trifluoroacetic acid, maleic acid<br>
or fumaric acid.<br>
The 2-(azetidinon-1-yl)alkanedioic acid esters and amides of formulae I<br>
and II are prepared by syntheses well known in the art. As illustrated for compounds of<br>
formula I, the 2-(azetidinon-1-yl)alkanedioic acid esters are obtainable by the 2+2<br>
cycloaddition of an appropriately substituted acetic acid derivative (i), and an imine ester<br>
(ii) as described in Synthetic Scheme I, where Z is a leaving group, and the integer n, and<br>
the moieties A, A', R2, R3, and R4 are as previously described. The term "leaving group"<br>
as used hereinafter refers to a subsitutent, such as halo, acyloxy, benzoyloxy and the like,<br>
present on an activated carbon atom that may be replaced by a nucleophile. The<br>
chemistry described in Synthetic Scheme I is applicable to imines (ii) bearing ester,<br>
thioester, or amide moieties.<br>
Synthetic Scheme I<br><br>
The preparation of the appropriate imines (ii) and most of the required acetyl halides or<br>
anhydrides (i), as well as the cycloaddition procedure, are generally described in U.S.<br>
Patent Nos. 4,665, 171 and 4, 751,299, hereby incorporated by reference. The analogous<br>
synthesis of compounds of formula II may be accomplished by this process using the<br>
appropriate alkoxy-substituted amino acid imines.<br>
Those compounds of formulae I and II of the invention requiring R3 to be<br>
4-substituted oxazolidin-2-on-3-yl or 1,4,5-trisubstituted imidazolidin-2-on-3-yl are<br>
prepared from the corresponding (4-substituted oxazolidin-2-on-3-yI)- or (1,4,5-<br>
trisubstituted imidazolidin-2-on-3-yl)-acetyl halide or anhydride. The acid halide or<br>
anhydride is available from an appropriately substituted glycine. The glycine is first<br>
converted to the carbamate and then reduced to provide the corresponding alcohol. The<br>
alcohol is then cyclized to the 4-substituted oxazolidin-2-one, which is subsequently N-<br>
alkylated with a haloacetic acid ester. The ester is hydrolyzed, and the resulting acid is<br>
converted to the acetyl halide or anhydride (i).<br>
Those compounds of the invention requiring R3 to be 2,5-disubstituted<br>
oxazolidin-4-on-3-yl or 1,2,5-trisubstituted imidazolidin-4-on-3-yl are prepared from the<br>
corresponding (2,5-disubstituted oxazolidin-4-on-3-yl)- or (1,2,5-trisubstituted<br>
imidazolidin-4-on-3-yl)acetyl chlorides or anhydrides respectively. The chemistry to<br>
prepare these reagents is described in U.S. Patent No. 4,772,694, hereby incorporated by<br>
reference. Briefly, the required oxazolidinone or imidazolidinone is obtained from an<br>
a-hydroxyacid or an a-aminoacid, respectively. The imidazolones are prepared by<br>
converting the a-aminoacid, (R11)-CH(NH2)CO2H, to an amino-protected amide and then<br>
condensing the amide with an aldehyde, (R10)-CHO, in the presence of an acid to form<br>
the 3-protected imidazolidin-4-one, where R10 and R11 are as defined above. The<br>
1-position may be functionalized with an appropriate reagent to introduce R12 and the<br>
3-position deprotected, where R12 is as defined above. The imidazolidin-4-one ring is<br>
then alkylated with a haloacetic acid ester, the ester deesterified, and the resulting acetic<br>
acid converted to the desired acid halide or anhydride (i). The required oxazolidinones<br>
are prepared in an analogous manner from the corresponding a-hydroxyacid,<br>
(R11)-CH(OH)CO2H.<br>
Those compounds of the invention requiring R3 to be succinimido are<br>
prepared from the corresponding 2-(succinimido)acetyl halide or anhydride. The<br>
chemistry to prepare these reagents is described in U.S. Patent No. 4,734,498, hereby<br>
incorporated by reference. Briefly, these reagents are obtained from tartaric acid or, when<br>
one of R10 and R11 is hydrogen, from malic acid. Tartaric acid is acylated or O-alkylated,<br>
the corresponding diacyl or di-O-alkyl tartaric acid is treated with an acid anhydride to<br>
form the succinic anhydride, and reaction of this succinic anhydride with an ester of<br>
glycine to form first the noncyclic half amide ester which is then cyclized to the 3,4-<br>
disubstituted succinimidoacetic acid ester. The ester group is deesterified and the<br>
resulting acid converted to the corresponding acid halide or anhydride (i). The mono-<br>
substituted succinimidoacetyl halide or anhydride is obtained with malic acid via succinic<br>
anhydride formation followed by succinimide formation as described above.<br>
Those compounds of the invention requiring R3 to be an N-substituted<br>
amine or an N-substituted urea may be prepared from the corresponding phthalimido<br>
protected 3-amino analogs. The phthalimide protecting group may be removed using<br>
conventional procedures, such as by treatment with hydrazine, and the like. Once<br>
liberated, the amine may be alkylated with any one of a variety of alkyl and cycloalkyl<br>
halides and sulfates, such as methyl iodide, isopropylbromide, diethyl sulfate,<br>
cyclopropylmethylbromide, cyclopentyliodide, and the like. Such amines may also be<br>
acylated with acid halides, acid anhydrides, isocyanates, isothiocyanates, such as acetyl<br>
chloride, propionic anhydride, methylisocyanate, 3-trifluoromethylphenylisothiocyanate,<br>
and the like.<br>
The bases to be used in Synthetic Scheme I include, among others,<br>
aliphatic tertiary amines, such as trimethylamine and triethylamine, cyclic tertiary amines,<br>
such as N-methylpiperidine and N-methylmorpholine, aromatic amines, such as pyridine<br>
and lutidine, and other organic bases such as 1,8-diazabicyclo[5,4,0]undec-7-ene (DBU).<br>
The solvents useful for reactions described in Synthetic Scheme I include,<br>
among others, dioxane, tetrahydrofuran, diethyl ether, ethyl acetate, dichloromethane,<br>
chloroform, carbon tetrachloride, benzene, toluene, acetonitrile, dimethyl sulfoxide and<br>
N,N-dimethylformamide.<br>
Alternatively, the compounds of formulae I and II may be prepared via N-<br>
C(4) cyclization, as illustrated for compounds of formula I in Synthetic Scheme II, via<br>
cyclizatoin of ß-hydroxy amides iii, where R2, R3, R4, A, and A' are as defined<br>
previously, according to the procedure of Townsend and Nguyen in J. Am. Chem. Sov.<br>
1981, 103, 4582, and Miller and Mattingly in Tetra. 1983, 39, 2563, the disclosures of<br>
which are incorporated herein by reference. The analogous synthesis of compounds of<br>
formula II may be accomplished by cyclizatoin of ß-hydroxy amides of alkoxy-<br>
substituted amino acids.<br>
Synthetic Scheme II<br><br>
The azetidinone ring may also be prepared with a deficit of substituents<br>
R3, R4, or the R2-substituted N-alkanedioic acid or alkoxyalkanoic acid moiety, but<br>
possessing substituents capable of being elaborated through subsequent chemical<br>
transformation to such groups described for compounds of formulae I and II. In general,<br>
azetidinones may be prepared via N-C(4) cyclization, such as the cyclization of<br>
acylhydroxamates iv to azetidinone intermediates v, as depicted in Scheme III, where R2,<br>
R3, R4, A, and A' are as defined above, according to the procedure of Mattingly et al. in J.<br>
Am. Chem. Soc. 1979, 101, 3983 and Accts. Chem. Res. 1986, 19, 49, the disclosures of<br>
which are incorporated herein by reference. It is appreciated that other hydroxamates,<br>
such as alkylhydroxamates, aryl hydroxamates, and the like, are suitable for carrying out<br>
the cyclization.<br>
Synthetic Scheme III<br><br>
Subsequent chemical transformation of the acyloxyazetidinone v to introduce for example<br>
an R2-substituted alkanedioic acid moiety using conventional procedures will<br>
illustratively provide compounds of formula I. The analogous synthesis of compounds of<br>
formula II may be accomplished by this process using an appropriate R2-substituted<br>
alkoxyalkanoic acid.<br>
An alternative cyclization to form intermediate azetidinones, which may<br>
be further elaborated to compounds of formulae I and II, may occur by oxidative<br>
cyclization of acylhydroxamates vi to intermediate azetidinones vii, as illustrated in<br>
Synthetic Scheme IV, where R3 is as defined above, according to the procedure of<br>
Rajendra and Miller in J. Org. Chem. 1987, 52, 4471 and Tetrahedron Lett. 1985, 26,<br>
5385, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference. The group R in<br>
Scheme IV represents an alkyl or aryl moiety selected to provide R4, as defined above,<br>
upon subsequent transformation. For example, R may be the group PhCH2-, as in vii-a,<br>
such that oxidative elimination of HBr will provide the desired R4, a styryl group, as in<br>
vii-b. It is appreciated that elaboration of R to R4 is not necessarily performed<br>
immediately subsequent to the cyclization and may be performed conveniently after other<br>
steps in the synthesis of compounds of formulae I and II. It is further appreciated that<br>
alternatives to the acylhydroxamates shown, such as alkylhydroxamates, aryl<br>
hydroxamates, and the like, are suitable for carrying out the cyclization.<br>
Synthetic Scheme IV<br><br>
Other useful intermediates, such as the azetidinone-4-carboxaldehyde viii<br>
illustrated in Synthetic Scheme V for preparing for example compounds of formula I,<br>
may be further elaborated to 4-(R4)-substituted azetidinones via an olefination reaction.<br>
The group R in Scheme V is selected such that upon successful olefination of the<br>
carboxaldehyde the resulting group R-CHCH- corresponds to the desired alkyl or aryl<br>
moiety R4, as defined above. Such olefination reactions may be accomplished by any of<br>
the variety of known procedures, such as by Wittig olefination, Peterson olefination, and<br>
the like. Synthetic Scheme V illustrates the corresponding Wittig olefination with<br>
phosphorane ix. The analogous synthesis of compounds of formula II may be<br>
accomplished by this process using an appropriate alkoxy-substituted azetidinone-4-<br>
carboxaldehyde derivative.<br>
Synthetic Scheme V<br><br>
Still other useful intermediates, such as the azetidinonyl acetic acid<br>
derivatives x, may be converted into compounds of formulae I and II, as illustrated for<br>
the synthesis of compounds of formula I in Synthetic Scheme VI. Introduction of an R2<br>
moiety, and a carboxylic acid derivative A'-C(O)-(CH2)n- for compounds of formula I, or<br>
an alkoxyalkanoic acid derivative R6'O-(CH2)n- for compounds of formula II, may be<br>
accomplished by alkylation of the anion of x, where the integers n and n', and the groups<br>
R2, R3, R4, R6', A, and A' are as defined above.<br>
Synthetic Scheme VI<br><br>
Acetic acid derivative x is deprotonated and subsequently alkylated with an alkyl halide<br>
corresponding to R2-Z, where Z is a leaving group, to provide intermediate xi.<br>
Illustratively, the anion of xi may be alkylated with a compound Z'-(CH2)nCOA', where Z'<br>
is a leaving group, to provide compounds of formula I. It is appreciated that the order of<br>
introduction of either the substituent R2 or the acid derivative -(CH2)nCOA', or the<br>
alkoxyalkanoic acid derivative -(CH2)nOR6, is conveniently chosen by the skilled artisan<br>
and such order of introduction may be different for each compound of formula I or<br>
formula II.<br>
A solution of the 2-(3,4-disubstituted azetidin-2-on-1-yi)acetic acid<br>
derivative x or xi in an appropriate solvent, such as tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, or diethyl<br>
ether, is treated with a non-nucleophilic base to generate the anion of x or xi, respectively.<br>
Suitable bases for this transformation include lithium diisopropylamide, lithium 2,2,6,6-<br>
tetramethylpiperidinamide, or lithium bis(trimethylsilyl)amide. The anion is then<br>
quenched with an appropriate electrophile to provide the desired compounds. Illustrative<br>
electrophiles represented by the formulae R2-Z, R5'X'N-C(O)-(CH2)n-Z, or<br>
R6'O-C(O)-(CH2)n-Z provide the corresponding compounds xi or I, respectively. The<br>
analogous synthesis of compounds of formula II may be accomplished by this process by<br>
using an electrophile represented by the formula R6O-(CH2)n-Z.<br>
As discussed above, the compounds prepared as described in Synthetic<br>
Schemes I, II, III, IV, V, and VI may be pure diastereomers, mixtures of diastereomers, or<br>
racemates. The actual stereochemical composition of the compound will be dictated by<br>
the specific reaction conditions, combination of substituents, and stereochemistry of the<br>
reactants employed. It is appreciated that diasteromeric mixtures may be separated by<br>
chromatography or fractional crystallization to provide single diastereomers if desired.<br>
Particularly, the reactions described in Synthetic Schemes III, IV, and VI create a new<br>
chiral center at the carbon bearing R2, except when n=0 and A=A'.<br>
Compounds of formula I which are 2-(3,4-disubstituted azetidin-2-on-1-<br>
yl)alkanedioic acid half-esters, such as compounds I-a where A' is R6'O-, while useful<br>
vasopressin V1a agents in their own right, may also be converted to the corresponding<br>
half-carboxylic acids xii, where the integer n and the groups R2, R3, R4, R5', R6', A, and X'<br>
are as previously defined, as illustrated in Synthetic Scheme VII. These intermediates are<br>
useful for the preparation of other compounds of the invention, such as I-b where A' is<br>
R5'X'N-. It is appreciated that the transformation illustrated in Synthetic Scheme VII is<br>
equally applicable for the preparation of compounds I where A' is X'NH- or where a<br>
different R6'O- is desired.<br>
Synthetic Scheme VII<br><br>
The requisite carboxylic acid xii may be prepared from the corresponding<br>
ester via saponification under standard conditions by treatment with hydroxide followed<br>
by protonation of the resultant carboxylate anion. Where R6 is tert-butyl, the ester I-a<br>
may be dealkylated by treatment with trifluoroacetic acid. Where R6 is benzyl, the ester<br>
I-a may be dealkylated either by subjection to mild hydrogenolysis conditions, or by<br>
reaction with elemental sodium or lithium in liquid ammonia. Finally, where R6 is 2-<br>
(trimethylsilyl)ethyl, the ester I-a may be deprotected and converted into the<br>
corresponding acid xii by treatment with a source of fluoride ion, such as<br>
tetrabutylammonium fluoride. The choice of conditions is dependent upon the nature of<br>
the R6 moiety and the compatability of other functionality in the molecule with the<br>
reaction conditions.<br>
The carboxylic acid xii is converted to the corresponding amide I-b under<br>
standard conditions well recognized in the art. The acid may be first converted to the<br>
corresponding acid halide, preferably the chloride or fluoride, followed by treatment with<br>
an appropriate primary or secondary amine to provide the corresponding amide.<br>
Alternatively, the acid may be converted under standard conditions to a mixed anhydride.<br>
This is typically accomplished by first treating the carboxylic acid with an amine, such as<br>
triethylamine, to provide the corresponding carboxylate anion. This carboxylate is then<br>
reacted with a suitable haloformate, for example benzyl chloroformate, ethyl<br>
chloroformate or isobutylchloroformate, to provide the corresponding mixed anhydride.<br>
This anhydride may then be treated with an appropriate primary or secondary amine to<br>
provide the desired amide. Finally, the carboxylic acid may be treated with a typical<br>
peptide coupling reagent such as N,N'-carbonyldiimidazole (CDI),<br>
N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC) and 1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-3-<br>
ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC), followed by the appropriate amine of formula<br>
R5XNH. A polymer-supported form of EDC has been described in Tetrahedron Letters,<br>
34(48), 7685 (1993), the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference, and is<br>
very useful for the preparation of the compounds of the present invention. It is<br>
appreciated that substituting an appropriate amine with an appropriate alcohol in the<br>
synthethic scheme presented above will provide the esters of the invention, e.g. analogs of<br>
I-a with a different ester R6'O-.<br>
The carboxylic acid may alternatively be converted into the corresponding<br>
tert-butyl ester via treatment of the acid with an acid catalyst, such as concentrated<br>
sulfuric acid, and the like, and with isobutylene in a suitable solvent, such as dioxane, and<br>
the like. The reaction is preferably carried out under pressure in an appropriate vessel,<br>
such as a pressure bottle, and the like. Reaction times of about 18 hours are not<br>
uncommon. The desired ester may be be isolated from the organic layer after partitioning<br>
the reaction mixture between a suitable organic solvent, such as ethyl acetate, and the<br>
like, and a basic aqueous layer, such as cold 1N sodium hydroxide, and the like.<br>
It is appreciated that the transformation illustrated in Synthetic Scheme VII<br>
may also be used to convert in an analogous fashion, the half-ester I where A is R6O- to<br>
the corresponding acid and subsequently into derivatives I where A is XNH-, R5XN-, or a<br>
different R6O-. Finally, it is appreciated that the transformation in Synthetic Scheme VII<br>
may also be used to convert in an analogous fashion the esters of formula II, where A is<br>
R6O-, to the corresponding acids, and subsequently into derivatives of formula II, where<br>
A is XNH-, R5XN-, or a different R6O-.<br>
Compounds of formulae I and II where R4 includes an ethenyl or ethynyl spacer,<br>
such as for example, compounds I-c and I-d, respectively, may be converted into the<br>
corresponding arylethyl derivatives, compounds I-e, via reduction, as illustrated for<br>
compounds of formula I in Synthetic Scheme VIII. Conversion is accomplished by<br>
catalytic hydrogenation, and other like reductions, where the integer n and the groups R2,<br>
R3, A, and A' are as previously defined. The corresponding compounds of formula II<br>
may also be converted from ethyne and ethene precursors in an analogous fashion. The<br>
moiety R depicted in Scheme VIII is chosen such that the substituent R-CC-, R-CHCH-,<br>
or R-CH2CH2- corresponds to the desired R4 of formulae I or II as defined above.<br>
Synthetic Scheme VIII<br><br>
The hydrogenation of the triple or double bond proceeds readily over a precious metal<br>
catalyst, such as palladium on carbon. The hydrogenation solvent may consist of a lower<br>
alkanol, such as methanol or ethanol, tetrahydrofuran, or a mixed solvent system of<br>
tetrahydrofuran and ethyl acetate. The hydrogenation may be performed at an initial<br>
hydrogen pressure of about 20-80 p.s.i., preferably about 50-60 p.s.i., at a temperature of<br>
about 0-60 °C, preferably within the range of from ambient temperature to about 40 °C,<br>
for about 1 hour to about 3 days.<br>
Alternatively, the ethynyl spacer of compound I-c may be selectively<br>
reduced to the ethenyl spacer of compound I-d using poisoned catalyts, such as Pd on<br>
BaSO4, Lindlar's catalyst, and the like. It is appreciated that either the Z or E double<br>
bond geometry of compound I-d may be advantageously obtained by the appropriate<br>
choice of reaction conditions. The analogous synthesis of compounds of formula II may<br>
be accomplished by this process.<br>
Compounds of formula I and II where R3 is phthalimido are conveniently<br>
treated with hydrazine or a hydrazine derivative, for example methylhydrazine, to prepare<br>
the corresponding 2-(3-amino-4-substituted azetidin-2-on-1-yl)alkanedioic acid<br>
derivatives xiii, as illustrated in Synthetic Scheme IX for compounds of formula I, where<br>
the integer n, and the groups R2, R4, R12, A, and A' are as previously defined. This<br>
compound may then be treated with an appropriate alkylating or acylating agent to<br>
prepare the corresponding amines or amides I-g, or alternatively intermediates xiii may be<br>
treated with an appropriate isocyanate to prepare the corresponding ureas I-h.<br>
Synthetic Scheme IX<br><br>
The ureas I-h are prepared by treating a solution of the appropriate amine<br>
xiii in a suitable solvent, such as chloroform or dichloromethane, with an appropriate<br>
isocyanate, RI2NCO. If necessary, an excess of the isocyanate is employed to ensure<br>
complete reaction of the starting amine. The reactions are performed at about ambient<br>
temperature to about 45 °C, for from about three hours to about three days. Typically, the<br>
product may be isolated by washing the reaction with water and concentrating the<br>
remaining organic components under reduced pressure. When an excess of isocyanate<br>
has been used, however, a polymer bound primary or secondary amine, such as an<br>
aminomethylated polystyrene, may be conveniently added to facilitate removal of the<br>
excess reagent. Isolation of products from reactions where a polymer bound reagent has<br>
been used is greatly simplified, requiring only filtration of the reaction mixture and then<br>
concentration of the filtrate under reduced pressure.<br>
The substituted amines and amides I-g are prepared by treating a solution<br>
of the appropriate amine xiii in a suitable solvent, such as chloroform or<br>
dichloromethane, with an appropriate acylating or alkylating agent, R12-C(O)Z or R12-Z,<br>
respectively. If necessary, an excess of the acylating or alkylating agent is employed to<br>
ensure complete reaction of the starting amine. The reactions are performed at about<br>
ambient temperature to about 45 °C, for from about three hours to about three days.<br>
Typically, the product may be isolated by washing the reaction with water and<br>
concentrating the remaining organic components under reduced pressure. When an<br>
excess of the acylating or alkylating agent has been used, however, a polymer bound<br>
primary or secondary amine, such as an aminomethylated polystyrene, may be<br>
conveniently added to facilitate removal of the excess reagent. Isolation of products from<br>
reactions where a polymer bound reagent has been used is greatly simplified, requiring<br>
only filtration of the reaction mixture and then concentration of the filtrate under reduced<br>
pressure. The analogous synthesis of compounds of formula II may be accomplished by<br>
this process.<br>
The following preparations and examples further illustrate the synthesis of<br>
the compounds of this invention and are not intended to limit the scope of the invention<br>
in any way. Unless otherwise indicated, all reactions were performed at ambient<br>
temperature, and all evaporations were performed in vacuo. All of the compounds<br>
described below were characterized by standard analytical techniques, including nuclear<br>
magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H NMR) and mass spectral analysis (MS).<br>

dichloromethane was treated with a catalytic amount of anhydrous dimethylformamide<br>
(85 µL / milliequivalent of acetic acid derivative) resulting in vigorous gas evolution.<br>

under reduced pressure to provide the title compound as an off-white solid after drying<br>
for 2 h under vacuum.<br>

dry tetrahydrofuran was treated with 0.68 mL (4.74 mmol) of 3-(trifiuoromethyI)benzyl<br>
amine. Upon completion (TLC, 60:40 hexanes/ethyl acetate), the mixture was<br>
evaporated, and the resulting oil was partitioned between dichloromethane and a saturated<br>
aqueous solution of sodium bicarbonate. The organic laer was evaporated to give 2.23 g<br>

3-(trifiuoromethyl)benzyl amine was replaced with the appropriate amine.<br>

reaction was quenched with of dichloromethane (10 mL) and saturated aqueous<br>

evaporated. The resulting residue was purified by flash column chromatography (98:2<br>

A solution of 1 g (2.93 mmol) of N-benzyloxycarbonyl-D-aspartic acid<br>

sequential addition of 0.46 mL (3.21 mmol) of 3-(trifluoromethyl)benzylamine, 0.44 g<br>

ambient temperature or until complete as determined by thin layer chromatography (95:5<br>

Example 14. General procedure for formation of a 2-azetidinone from an imine and an<br>
acetyl chloride.<br>
Step 1: General procedure for formation of an imine from an amino acid derivative.<br>
A solution of 1 equivalent of an a-amino acid ester or amide in<br>
dichloromethane is treated sequentially with 1 equivalent of an appropriate aldehyde, and<br>
a dessicating agent, such as magnesium sulfate or silica gel, in the amount of about 2<br>
grams of dessicating agent per gram of starting a-amino acid ester or amide. The reaction<br>
is stirred at ambient temperature until all of the reactants are consumed as measured by<br>
thin layer chromatography. The reactions are typically complete within an hour. The<br>
reaction mixture is then filtered, the filter cake is washed with dichloromethane, and the<br>
filtrate concentrated under reduced pressure to provide the desired imine that is used as is<br>
in the subsequent step.<br>
Step 2: General procedure for the 2+2 cycloaddition of an imine and an acetyl chloride.<br>
A dichloromethane solution of the imine (10 mL dichloromethane/1 gram<br>
imine) is cooled to 0 °C. To this cooled solution is added 1.5 equivalents of an<br>
appropriate amine, typically triethylamine, followed by the dropwise addition of a<br>
dichloromethane solution of 1.1 equivalents of an appropriate acetyl chloride, such as that<br>
described in Example 1(10 mL dichloromethane/1 gm appropriate acetyl chloride). The<br>
reaction mixture is allowed to warm to ambient temperature over 1 h and is then<br>
quenched by the addition of a saturated aqueous solution of ammonium chloride. The<br>
resulting mixture is partitioned between water and dichloromethane. The layers are<br>
separated and the organic layer is washed successively with 1N hydrochloric acid,<br>
saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate, and saturated aqueous sodium chloride. The<br>
organic layer is dried over magnesium sulfate and concentrated under reduced pressure.<br>
The residue may be used directly for further reactions, or purified by chromatography or<br>
by crystallization from an appropriate solvent system if desired.<br>

azetidinone) is cooled to -78 °C and is with lithium bis(trimethylsilyl)amide (2.2<br>
equivalents). The resulting anion is treated with an appropriate acyl halide (1.1<br>
equivlants). Upon complete conversion of the azetidinone, the reaction is quenched with<br>
saturated aqueous ammonium chloride and partitioned between ethyl acetate and water.<br>
The organic phase is washed sequentially with 1N hydrochloric acid, saturated aqueous<br>
sodium bicarbonate, and saturated aqueous sodium chloride. The resulting organic layer<br>
is dried (magnesium sulfate) and evaporated. The residue is purified by silica gel<br>
chromatography with an appropriate eluent, such as 3:2 hexane/ethyl acetate.<br>

Example 26. General procedure for hydrolysis of a tert-butyl ester.<br>
A solution of tert-butyl ester derivative in formic acid, typically 1 g in 10<br>
mL, is stirred at ambient temperature until no more ester is detected by thin layer<br>
chromatography (dichloromethane 95% / methanol 5%), a typical reaction time being<br>
around 3 hours. The formic acid is evaporated under reduced pressure; the resulting solid<br>
residue is partitioned between dichloromethane and saturated aqueous sodium<br>
bicarbonate. The organic layer is evaporated to give an off-white solid that may be used<br>
directly for further reactions, or recrystallized from an appropriate solvent system if<br>
desired.<br>

Method Example 1. Human vasopression V1a receptor binding assay.<br>
A cell line expressing the human V1a receptor in CHO cells (henceforth<br>
referred to as the hV1a cell line) was obtained from Dr. Michael Brownstein, NIMH,<br>
Bethesda, MD, USA. The hV1a cDNA sequence is described by Thibonnier et al.,<br>
Journal of Biological Chemistry, 269, 3304-3310 (1994), and the expression method was<br>
the same as described by Morel et al. (1992). The hV1a cell line was grown in alpha-<br>
MEM with 10% fetal bovine serum and 250µg/ml G418 (Gibco, Grand Island, NY,<br>
USA). For competitive binding assay, hVla cells were plated into 6-well culture plate at<br>
1:10 dilution from a confluency flask, and maintained in culture for at least two days.<br>
Culture medium was then removed, cells were washed with 2ml binding buffer (25mM<br>
Hepes, 0.25% BSA, 1x DMEM, PH = 7.0). To each well, 990 µl binding buffer<br>
containing lnM 3H-AVP was added, and followed by 10 µl series diluted Example<br>
compounds dissolved in DMSO. All incubations were in triplicate, and dose-inhibition<br>
curves consisted of total binding (DMSO) and 5 concentrations (0.1, 1.0, 10, 100, and<br>
1000 nM) of test agents encompassing the IC50. 100 nM cold AVP (Sigma) was used to<br>
assess non-specific binding. Cells were incubated for 45 minutes at 37 °C, assay mixture<br>
was removed and each well was washed three times with PBS (pH = 7.4). 1ml 2% SDS<br>
was added per well and plates were let sit for 30 minutes. The whole content in a well<br>
was transferred to a scintillation vial. Each well was rinsed with 0.5ml PBS which was<br>
then added to the corresponding vial. Scintillation fluid (Ecoscint, National Diagnostics,<br>
Atlanta, Georgia) was then added at 3ml per vial. Samples were counted in a liquid<br>
scintillation counter (Beckman LS3801). IC50 values were calculated by Prism Curve<br>
fitting software.<br>
All of the alkanedioic esters and amides exemplified in the foregoing<br>
examples were tested m this assay described of Example 201. Binding affinities for<br>
certain of the preferred compounds are summarized in the Table 17.<br>
Method Example 2. Inhibition of phosphatidylinositol turnover.<br>
The physiological effects of vasopressin are mediated through specific G-<br>
protein coupled receptors. The vasopressin V1a receptor is coupled to the Gq/G11 family<br>
of G proteins and mediates phosphatidylinositol turnover. The agonist or antagonist<br>
character of the compounds of the invention may be determined by their ability to inhibit<br>
vasopressin-mediated turnover of phosphatidylinositol by the procedure described in the<br>
following paragraphs. Representative compounds of the invention, the compounds of<br>
Examples 35, 44, 88, 110, and 133, were tested in this assay and found to be vasopressin<br>
Vla antagonists.<br>
Cell culture and labeling of cells.<br>
Three days prior to the assay, near-confluent cultures of hVla cells were<br>
dissociated and seeded in 6-well tissue culture plates, about 100 wells being seeded from<br>
each 75 cm2 flask (equivalent to 12:1 split ratio). Each well contained 1 mL of growth<br>
medium with 2 µCi of [3H]myo-inositol (American Radiolabeled Chemicals, St. Louis,<br>
MO, USA).<br>
Incubations<br>
All assays were in triplicate except for basal and 10 nM AVP (both n = 6).<br>
AVP ((arginine vasopressin), Peninsula Labs, Belmont, CA, USA (#8103)) was dissolved<br>
in 0.1N acetic acid. Test agents were dissolved in DMSO and diluted in DMSO to 200<br>
times the final test concentration. Test agents and AVP (or corresponding volumes of<br>
DMSO) were added separately as 5 (iL in DMSO to 12x75 mm glass tubes containing 1<br>
mL of assay buffer (Tyrode's balanced salt solution containing 50 mM glucose, 10 mM<br>
LiCl, 15 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 10 µM phosphoramidon, and 100 µM bacitracin). The<br>
order of incubations was randomized. Incubations were initiated by removing the<br>
prelabeling medium, washing the monolayer once with 1 mL of 0.9% NaCl, and<br>
transferring the contents of the assay tubes to corresponding wells. The plates were<br>
incubated for 1 hour at 37 °C. Incubations were terminated by removing the incubation<br>
medium and adding 500 p.L of ice cold 5% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid and allowing the<br>
wells to stand for 15 min.<br>
Measurement of [3H]inositol phosphates<br>
BioRad Poly-Prep Econo-Columns were packed with 0.3 mL of AG 1 X-8<br>
100-200 formate form resin. Resin was mixed 1:1 with water and 0.6 mL added to each<br>
column. Columns were then washed with 10 mL water. Scintillation vials (20mL) were<br>
placed under each column. For each well, the contents were transferred to a minicolumn,<br>
after which the well was washed with 0.5 mL distilled water, which was also added to the<br>
minicolumn. The columns were then washed twice with 5 mL of 5 mM myo-inositol to<br>
elute free inositol. Aliquots (1 mL) were transferred to 20 mL scintillation vials and 10<br>
mL of Beckman Ready Protein Plus added. After the myo-inositol wash was complete,<br>
empty scintillation vials were placed under the columns, and [3H]inositol phosphates<br>
were eluted with three additions of 1 mL 0.5 M ammonium formate containing 0.1 N<br>
formic acid. Elution conditions were optimized to recover inositol mono-, bis-, and<br>
trisphosphates, without eluting the more metabolically inert tetrakis-, pentakis-, and<br>
hexakis-phosphates. To each sample was added 10 mL of a high salt capacity<br>
scintillation fluid such as Tru-Count High Salt Capacity or Packard Hionic-Fluor.<br>
Inositol lipids were measured by adding 1 mL of 2% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) to<br>
each well, allowing the wells to stand for at least 30 min., and transferring the solution to<br>
20 mL scintillation vials, to which 10 mL Beckman Ready Protein Plus scintillation fluid<br>
was then added. Samples were counted in a Beckman LS 3801 liquid scintillation<br>
counter for 10 min. Total inositol incorporation for each well was calculated as the sum<br>
of free inositol, inositol phosphates, and inositol lipids.<br>
Data analysis: concentration-inhibition experiments<br>
Concentration-response curves for AVP and concentration-inhibition<br>
curves for test agents versus 10 nM AVP were analyzed by nonlinear least-squares curve-<br>
fitting to a 4-parameter logistic function. Parameters for basal and maximal inositol<br>
phosphates, EC50 or IC50, and Hill coefficient were varied to achieve the best fit. The<br>
curve-fitting was weighted under the assumption that the standard deviation was<br>
proportional to dpm of radioactivity. Full concentration-response curves for AVP were<br>
run in each experiment, and IC50 values were converted to Ki values by application of the<br>
Cheng-Prusoff equation, based on the EC50 for AVP in the same experiment. Inositol<br>
phosphates were expressed as dpm per 106 dpm of total inositol incorporation.<br>
Data analysis: competitivity experiments<br>
Experiments to test for competitivity of test agents consisted of<br>
concentration-response curves for AVP in the absence and presence of two or more<br>
concentrations of test agent. Data were fit to a competitive logistic equation<br><br>
where Y is dpm of inositol phosphates, B is concentration of basal inositol phosphates, M<br>
is the maximal increase in concentration of inositol phosphates, A is the concentration of<br>
agonist (AVP), E is the EC50 for agonist, D is the concentration of antagonist (test agent),<br>
K is the K1 for antagonist, and Q is the cooperativity (Hill coefficient).<br>
Vasopressin V1a receptors are also known to mediate platelet aggregation.<br>
Vasopressin V1a receptor agonists cause platelet aggregation, while vasopressin V1a<br>
receptor antagonists inhibit the platelet aggregation precipitated by vasopressin or<br>
vasopressin V1a agonists. The degree of antagonist activity of the compounds of the<br>
invention may be determined by the assay described in the following paragraphs.<br>
Blood from healthy, human volunteers was collected by venipuncture and<br>
mixed with heparin (60 mL of blood added to 0.4 mL of heparanized saline solution (4<br>
mg heparin/mL saline)). Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) was prepared by centrifuging whole<br>
blood (150 x g), and indomethacin (3 uM) was added to PRP to block the thromboxane-<br>
mediated release reaction. PRP was continuously stirred at 37 °C and change in optical<br>
density was followed after the addition of arginine vasopressin (AVP) (30 nM) to initiate<br>
aggregation. Compounds were dissolved in 50% dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) and added<br>
(10 µL/415 µL PRP) before the addition of AVP. The percent inhibition of AVP-induced<br>
aggregation was measured and an IC50 calculated.<br>
In studies using washed platelets, 50 mL of whole blood was mixed with<br>
10 mL of citrate/heparin solution (85 mM sodium citrate, 64 mM citric acid, 111 mM<br>
glucose, 5 units/mL heparin) and PRP isolated as described above. PRP was then<br>
centrifuged (150 x g) and the pellet resuspended in a physiologic buffer solution (10 mM<br>
HEPES, 135 mM sodium chloride, 5 mM potassium chloride, and 1 mM magnesium<br>
chloride) containing 10 uM indomethicin. Human fibrinogen (0.2 mg/mL) and calcium<br>
chloride (1 mM) were added to stirred platelets before initiating aggregation with AVP<br>
(30 nM) as previously described.<br>
The activity of compounds of formula I in the antagonism of the vasopressin<br>
V1a receptor provides a method of antagonizing the vasopressin V1a receptor comprising<br>
administering to a subject in need of such treatment an effective amount of a compound of<br>
that formula. It is known that numerous physiological and therapeutic benefits are obtained<br>
through the administration of drugs that antagonize the vasopressin V1a receptor. These<br>
activities may be catagorized as peripheral and central. Peripheral utilities include<br>
administration of vasopressin V1a antagonists of formula I as adjuncts in heart failure or as<br>
antithrombotic agents. Central effects include administration of vasopressin V1a antagonists<br>
of formula I in the treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder, aggressive disorders,<br>
depression and anxiety.<br>
Obsessive-compulsive disease appears in a great variety of degrees and<br>
symptoms, generally linked by the victim's uncontrollable urge to perform needless,<br>
ritualistic acts. Acts of acquiring, ordering, cleansing and the like, beyond any rational<br>
need or rationale, are the outward characteristic of the disease. A badly afflicted subject<br>
may be unable to do anything but carry out the rituals required by the disease. Obsessive-<br>
compulsive disease, in all its variations, is a preferred target of treatment with the present<br>
adjunctive therapy method and compositions. The utility of the compounds of Formula I<br>
in the treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder was demonstrated as described in the<br>
following assay.<br>
In golden hamsters, a particular stereotypy, flank marking behavior, can be<br>
induced by microinjections of vasopressin (10-100 nL, 1-100 µM) into the anterior<br>
hypothalamus (Ferris et al., Science, 224, 521-523 (1984); Albers and Ferris, Regulatory<br>
Peptides, 12, 257-260 (1985); Ferris et al., European Journal of Pharmacology, 154,<br>
153-159 (1988)). Following the releasing stimulus, the behavior is initiated by grooming,<br>
licking and combing of the large sebaceous glands on the dorsolateral flanks. Bouts of<br>
flank gland grooming may be so intense that the flank region is left matted and soaked in<br>
saliva. After grooming, the hamsters display flank marking behavior, a type of scent<br>
marking involved in olfactory communication (Johnston, Physio. Behav., 51, 437-448<br>
(1985); Ferris et al, Physio. Behav., 40, 661-664 (1987)), by arching the back and<br>
rubbing the flank glands vigorously against any vertical surface. Vasopressin-induced<br>
flank marking is usually induced within a minute after the microinjection (Ferris et al.,<br>
Science, 224, 521-523 (1984)). The behavior is specific to vasopressin, as micro-<br>
injections of other neuropeptides, excitatory amino acids, and catecholamines do not<br>
elicit flank marking (Ferris et al., Science, 224, 521-523 (1984); Albers and Ferris,<br>
Regulatory Peptides, 12, 257-260 (1985)). Furthermore, flank marking is specific to the<br>
vasopressin V1 receptor, as the behavior is selectively inhibited by V1 receptor <br>
antagonists and activated by V1 receptor agonists (Ferris et al., Neuroscience Letters, 55,<br>
239-243 (1985); Albers et al., Journal of Neuroscience, 6, 2085-2089 (1986); Ferris et<br>
al., European Journal of Pharmacology, 154, 153-159 (1988)).<br>
All animals were adult male golden hamsters (Mesocricetus auratus)<br>
weighing approximately 160 gm. The animals underwent stereotaxic surgery, and were<br>
allowed to recover before behavioral testing. The hamsters were kept on a reverse light<br>
cycle (14 hr light, 10 hr dark, lights on at 19:00) in Plexiglas™ cages, and received food<br>
and water ad libitum.<br>
Stereotaxic surgery was performed under pentobarbital anesthesia. The<br>
stereotaxic coordinates were: 1.1 mm anterior to the bregma, 1.8 mm lateral to the<br>
midsagittal suture at an 8° angle from the verticle line, and 4.5 mm below the dura. The<br>
nose bar was placed at the level of the interaural line. An unilateral 26-gauge guide<br>
cannula was lowered to the site and secured to the skull with dental cement. The guide<br>
cannulae were closed with a 33-gauge obturator extending 1 mm beyond the guide. The<br>
innercanulae used for the microinjections extended 3.0 mm beyond the guide to reach the<br>
anterior hypothalamus.<br>
The hamsters were microinjected with 1 µM vasopressin in a volume of<br>
150 nL. The vasopressin was given as a cocktail with 200 mM, 20 mM, 2 mM of the test<br>
compound or alone, in the vehicle, dimethylsulfoxide. Both the vasopressin and the test<br>
compound were dissolved in 100% dimethylsulfoxide. All injections were aimed at the<br>
anterior hypothalamus. Animals were scored for flank marking for a period of 10<br>
minutes in a clean cage.<br>
Another aspect of this invention is the use of compounds of formula I in<br>
combination with a serotonin reuptake inhibitor for use in the treatment of obsessive-<br>
compulsive disease, aggressive disorder, or depression. Compounds useful as serotonin<br>
reuptake inhibitors include but are not limited to:<br>
Fluoxetine, N-methyl-3-(p-trifiuoromethylphenoxy)-3-phenylpropylamine,<br>
is marketed in the hydrochloride salt form, and as the racemic mixture of its two<br>
enantiomers. U.S. Patent No. 4,314,081 is an early reference on the compound.<br>
Robertson et al., J. Med. Chem.. 31, 1412 (1988), taught the separation of the R and S<br>
enantiomers of fluoxetine and showed that their activity as serotonin uptake inhibitors is<br>
similar to each other. In this document, the word "fluoxetine" will be used to mean any<br>
acid addition salt or the free base, and to include either the racemic mixture or either of<br>
the R and S enantiomers;<br>
Duloxetine, N-methyl-3-(1 -naphthalenyloxy)-3-(2-thienyl)propanamine, is<br>
usually administered as the hydrochloride salt and as the (+) enantiomer. It was first<br>
taught by U.S. Patent No. 4,956,388, which shows its high potency. The word<br>
"duloxetine" will be used here to refer to any acid addition salt or the free base of the<br>
molecule;<br>
Venlafaxine is known in the literature, and its method of synthesis and its<br>
activity as an inhibitor of serotonin and norepinephrine uptake are taught by U.S. Patent<br>
No. 4,761,501. Venlafaxine is identified as compound A in that patent;<br>
Milnacipran (N,N-diethyl-2-aminomethyl-1-<br>
phenylcyclopropanecarboxamide) is taught by U.S. Patent No. 4,478,836, which prepared<br>
milnacipran as its Example 4. The patent describes its compounds as antidepressants.<br>
Moret et al., Neuropharmacology, 24, 1211-19 (1985), describe its pharmacological<br>
activities as an inhibitor of serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake;<br>
Citalopram, 1-[3-(dimethylamino)propyl]-1-(4-fluorophenyl)-l,3-dihydro-<br>
5-isobenzofurancarbonitrile, is disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,136,193 as a serotonin<br>
reuptake inhibitor. Its pharmacology was disclosed by Christensen et al., Eur. J.<br>
Pharmacol., 41, 153 (1977), and reports of its clinical effectiveness in depression may be<br>
found in Dufour et al., Int. Clin. Psychopharmacol., 2, 225 (1987), and Timmerman et al.,<br>
ibid., 239;<br>
Fluvoxamine, 5-methoxy-1-[4-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]-1-pentanone O-(2-<br>
aminoethyl)oxime, is taught by U.S. Patent No. 4,085,225. Scientific articles about the<br>
drug have been published by Claassen et al., Brit. J. Pharmacol., 60, 505 (1977); and De<br>

All of the above-referenced patents are hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
The adjunctive therapy of this aspect of the present invention is carried out<br>
by administering a vasopressin V1a antagonist together with a serotonin reuptake inhibitor<br>
in any manner that provides effective levels of the compounds in the body at the same<br>
time. All of the compounds concerned are orally available and are normally administered<br>
orally, and so oral administration of the adjunctive combination is preferred. They may<br>
be administered together, in a single dosage form, or may be administered separately.<br>
This aspect of the present invention provides a potentiation of the decrease<br>
in the concentration of vasopressin observed as an effect of administration of a<br>
vasopressin V1a antagonist by administration of a serotonin reuptake inhibitor. This<br>
aspect of the present invention is particularly suited for use in the treatment of depression<br>
and obsessive compulsive disorder. Such disorders may often be resistant to treatment<br>
with a serotonin reuptake inhibitor alone.<br>
Method Example 3. Human oxytocin binding and functional assay.<br>
Compounds of the present invention are believed to be oxytocin agents.<br>
Oxytocin preparations and a number of oxytocin agonists are commercially available for<br>
therapeutic use. In recent years, oxytocin antagonists with antiuterotonic activity have<br>
been developed and evaluated for their potential use in the treatment of preterm labor and<br>
dysmenorrhyea (Pavo et al., J. Med. Chem., 37, 255-259 (1994); Akerlund et al., Br. J.<br>
Obstet. GynaecoL, 94, 1040-1044 (1987); Akerlund et al., Br. J. Obstet. Gynaecoi, 86,<br>
484-487 (1979)). The oxytocin antagonist atosiban has been studied clinically and<br>
resulted in a more significant inhibition of preterm contractions than did placebo<br>
(Goodwin et al., Am. J. Obstet. Gynecoi, 170, 474 (1994)).<br>
The human oxytocin receptor has been cloned and expressed (Kimura et<br>
al., Nature, 356, 526-529 (1992)), it is identified under the accession number X64878. To<br>
demonstrate the affinity of the compounds of the present invention for the human oxytocin<br>
receptor, binding studies were performed using a cell line expressing the human oxytocin<br>
receptor in 293 cells (henceforth referred to as the OTR cell line) substantially by the<br>
procedure described by Morel et al. (Nature. 356, 523-526 (1992)). The 293 cell line is a<br>
permanent line of primary human embryonal kidney cells transformed by sheared human<br>
adenovirus type 5 DNA. It is identified as ATCC CRL-1533.<br>
The OTR cell line was grown in DMEM (Delbecco's Modified Essential<br>
Medium, Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mM L-glutamine,<br>
200 µg hygromycin (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) and 250 µg/ml G418 (Gibco, Grand<br>
Island, NY, USA). To prepare membranes, OTR cells were grown to confluency in 20<br>
roller bottles. Cells were dissociated with enzyme-free cell dissociation medium<br>
(Specialty Media, Lavallette, NJ, USA) and centrifuged at 3200 rpm for 15 minutes. The<br>
pellet was resuspended in 40 mL of Tris-HCl (tris[hydroxymethyl]aminornethane hydro-<br>
chloride) buffer (50 mM, pH 7.4) and homogenized for 1 minute with a Tekmar<br>
Tissumizer (Cincinnatti, OH USA). The suspension was centrifuged at 40,000 x g for 10<br>
minutes. The pellet was resuspended and centrifuged as above. The final pellet was<br>
suspended in 80 mL of Tris 7.4 buffer and stored in 4 mL aliquots at -80 oC. For assay,<br>
aliquots were resuspended in assay buffer and diluted to 375 ug protein per mL. Protein<br>
concentration was determined by BCA assay (Pierce, Rockford, TL, USA).<br>
Assay buffer was 50 mM Tris-HCl (tris[hydroxymethyl]aminomethane<br>
hydrochloride), 5 mM MgCl2, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin at pH 7.4. The radioligand<br>
for binding assays was [3H]oxytocin ([tyrosyl-2,6-3H]oxytocin, 48.5 Ci/mmol, DuPont<br>
NEN, Boston, MA, USA). The order of additions was 195 uL assay buffer, 200 µL OTR<br>
membranes (75 µg protein) in assay buffer, 5 µL of test agent in dimethylsulfoxide<br>
(DMSO) or DMSO alone, and 100 µL [3H]oxytocin in assay buffer (final concentration<br>
1.0 nM). Incubations were for one hour at room temperature. Bound radioligand was<br>
separated from free by filtration on a Brandel cell harvester (Gaithersburg, MD, USA)<br>
through Whatman GF/B glass-fiber filters that had been soaked for 2 hours in 0.3%<br>
polyethylenimine. The filters were washed with ice-cold 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.7 at<br>
25 °C) and the filter circles were placed in scintillation vials, to which were then added 5<br>
mL Ready Protein Plus™ scintillation fluid, and counted in a liquid scintillation counter.<br>
All incubations were in triplicate, and dose-inhibition curves consisted of total binding,<br>
nonspecific binding (100 µM oxytocin, Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA), and 6 or 7<br>
concentrations of test agent encompassing the IC50. Total binding was typically about<br>
1,000 cpm and nonspecific binding about 200 cpm. IC50 values were calculated by<br>
nonlinear least-squares curve-fitting to a 4-parameter logistic model. Certain compounds<br>
of formula I have shown affinity for the oxytocin receptor.<br>
Several bioassays are available to determine the agonist or antagonist<br>
character of compounds exhibiting affinity at the oxytocin receptor. One such assay is<br>
described in U.S. Patent No. 5,373,089, hereby incorporated by reference. Said bioassay<br>
is derived from procedures described in a paper by Sawyer et al. (Endocrinology, 106, 81<br>
(1980)), which in turn was based on a report of Holton (Brit. J. Pharmacol., 3, 328<br>
(1948)). The assay calculations for pA2 estimates are described by Schild {Brit. J.<br>
Pharmacol., 2, 189(1947)).<br>
Assay Method<br>
1. Animals-a 1.5 cm piece of uterus from a virgin rat (Holtzman) in<br>
natural estrus is used for the assay.<br>
2. Buffer/Assay Bath-The buffer used is Munsicks. This buffer contains 0.5<br>
mM Mg2+. The buffer is gassed continuously with 95% oxygen/5% carbon dioxide giving a<br>
pH of 7.4. The temperature of the assay bath is 37 °C. A 10 mL assay bath is used that<br>
contains a water jacket for maintaining the temperature and inlet and outlet spikets for adding<br>
and removing buffer.<br>
3. Polygraph/transducer-The piece of uterine tissue used for the assay is<br>
anchored at one end and connected to a Statham Strain Gauge Force Transducer at the other<br>
end which in turn is attached to a Grass Polygraph Model 79 for monitoring the contractions.<br>
4. Assay Protocol:<br>
(a) The tissue is equilibrated in the assay bath for one hour with washing with<br>
new buffer every 15 minutes. One gram of tension is kept on the tissue at all times.<br>
(b) The tissue is stimulated initially with oxytocin at 10 nM to acclimate the<br>
tissue and with 4 mM potassium chloride (KC1) to determine the maximum contractile<br>
response.<br>
(c) A cumulative dose response curve is then done with oxytocin and a<br>
concentration of oxytocin equivalent to approximately 80% of the maximum is used for<br>
estimating the pA2 of the antagonist.<br>
(d) The tissue is exposed to oxytocin (Calbiochemical, San Diego, CA) for<br>
one minute and washed out. There is a three minute interval before addition of the next dose<br>
of agonist or antagonist. When the antagonist is tested, it is given five minutes before the<br>
agonist. The agonist is given for one minute. All responses are integrated using a 7P10<br>
Grass Integrator. A single concentration of oxytocin, equal to 80% of the maximum<br>
response, is used to test the antagonist. Three different concentrations of antagonists are<br>
used, two that will reduce the response to the agonist by less than 50% and one that will<br>
reduce the response greater than 50% (ideally this relation would be 25%, 50% and 75%).<br>
This is repeated three times for each dose of antagonist for a three point assay.<br>
(e) Calculations for pA2-The dose-response (DR) ratios are calculated for<br>
antagonist and a Schild's Plot is performed by plotting the Log (DR-1) vs. Log of antagonist<br>
concentration. The line plotted is calculated by least-squares regression analysis. The pA2 is<br>
the concentration of antagonist at the point where the regression line crosses the 0 point of<br>
the Log (DR-1) ordinate. The pA2 is the negative Log of the concentration of antagonist that<br>
will reduce the response to the agonist by one-half.<br>
Oxytocin is well known for its hormonal role in parturition and lactation.<br>
Oxytocin agonists are useful clinically to induce lactation; induce or augment labor;<br>
control postpartum uterine atony and hemmorhage; cause uterine contraction after<br>
cesarean section or during other uterine surgery; and to induce therapeutic abortion.<br>
Oxytocin, acting as a neurotransmitter in the central nervous system, also plays an<br>
important role in the expression of central functions such as maternal behavior, sexual<br>
behavior (including penile erection, lordosis and copulatory behavior), yawning, tolerance<br>
and dependance mechanisms, feeding, grooming, cardiovascular regulation and<br>
thermoregulation (Argiolas and Gessa, Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews, 15,<br>
217-231 (1991)). Oxytocin antagonists find therapeutic utility as agents for the delay or<br>
prevention of premature labor; or to slow or arrest delivery for brief periods in order to<br>
undertake other therapeutic measures.<br>
Method Example 4. Tachykinin receptor binding assay.<br>
Compounds of the present invention are believed to be tachykinin agents.<br>
Tachykinins are a family of peptides which share a common amidated carboxy terminal<br>
sequence. Substance P was the first peptide of this family to be isolated, although its<br>
purification and the determination of its primary sequence did not occur until the early<br>
1970's. Between 1983 and 1984 several groups reported the isolation of two novel<br>
mammalian tachykinins, now termed neurokinin A (also known as substance K,<br>
neuromedin 1, and neurokinin a), and neurokinin B (also known as neuromedin K and<br>
neurokinin ß). See, J.E. Maggio, Peptides, 6 (Supplement 3), 237-243 (1985) for a review<br>
of these discoveries.<br>
Tachykinins are widely distributed in both the central and peripheral<br>
nervous systems. When released from nerves, they exert a variety of biological actions,<br>
which, in most cases, depend upon activation of specific receptors expressed on the<br>
membrane of target cells. Tachykinins are also produced by a number of non-neural<br>
tissues. The mammalian tachykinins substance P, neurokinin A, and neurokinin B act<br>
through three major receptor subtypes, denoted as NK-1, NK-2, and NK-3, respectively.<br>
These receptors are present in a variety of organs.<br>
Substance P is believed inter alia to be involved in the neurotransmission<br>
of pain sensations, including the pain associated with migraine headaches and with<br>
arthritis. These peptides have also been implicated in gastrointestinal disorders and<br>
diseases of the gastrointestinal tract such as inflammatory bowel disease. Tachykinins<br>
have also been implicated as playing a role in numerous other maladies, as discussed<br>
infra.<br>
In view of the wide number of clinical maladies associated with an excess<br>
of tachykinins, the development of tachykinin receptor antagonists will serve to control<br>
these clinical conditions. The earliest tachykinin receptor antagonists were peptide<br>
derivatives. These antagonists proved to be of limited pharmaceutical utility because of<br>
their metabolic instability. Recent publications have described novel classes of non-<br>
peptidyl tachykinin receptor antagonists which generally have greater oral bioavailability<br>
and metabolic stability than the earlier classes of tachykinin receptor antagonists.<br>
Examples of such newer non-peptidyl tachykinin receptor antagonists are found in<br>

publication WO 94/26735, published November 24, 1994. Assays useful for evaluating<br>
tachykinin receptor antagonists are well known in the art. See, e.g., J. Jukic et al., Life<br>
Sciences, 49, 1463-1469 (1991); N. Kucharczyk et al., Journal of Medicinal Chemistry,<br>
36, 1654-1661 (1993); N. Rouissi et al., Biochemical and Biophysical Research<br>
Communications, 176, 894-901 (1991).<br>
Method Example 5. NK-1 Receptor Binding Assay.<br>
Radioreceptor binding assays were performed using a derivative of a<br>
previously published protocol. D.G. Payan et al., Journal of Immunology, 133,3260-3265<br>
(1984). In this assay an aliquot of 1M9 cells (1 x 106 cells/tube in RPMI 1604 medium<br>
supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum) was incubated with 20 pM 125I-labeled<br>
substance P in the presence of increasing competitor concentrations for 45 minutes at<br>
4°C.<br>
The IM9 cell line is a well-characterized cell line which is readily<br>
available to the public. See, e.g.. Annals of the New York Academy of Science, 190,<br>
221-234 (1972); Nature (London), 251,443-444 (1974); Proceedings of the National<br>
Academy of Sciences (USA), 71, 84-88 (1974). These cells were routinely cultured in<br>
RPMI 1640 supplemented with 50 µg/mL gentamicin sulfate and 10% fetal calf serum.<br>
The reaction was terminated by filtration through a glass fiber filter<br>
harvesting system using filters previously soaked for 20 minutes in 0.1%<br>
polyethylenimine. Specific binding of labeled substance P was determined in the<br>
presence of 20 nM unlabeled ligand.<br>
Method Example 6. NK-2 Receptor Binding Assay.<br>
The CHO-hNK-2R cells, a CHO-derived cell line transformed with the<br>
human NK-2 receptor, expressing about 400,000 such receptors per cell, were grown in<br>
75 cm2 flasks or roller bottles in minimal essential medium (alpha modification) with<br>
10% fetal bovine serum. The gene sequence of the human NK-2 receptor is given in N.P.<br>
Gerard et al. Journal of Biological Chemistry, 265, 20455-20462 (1990).<br>
For preparation of membranes, 30 confluent roller bottle cultures were<br>
dissociated by washing each roller bottle with 10 ml of Dulbecco's phosphate buffered<br>
saline (PBS) without calcium and magnesium, followed by addition of 10 ml of<br>
enzyme-free cell dissociation solution (PBS-based, from Specialty Media, Inc.). After an<br>
additional 15 minutes, the dissociated cells were pooled and centrifuged at 1,000 RPM<br>
for 10 minutes in a clinical centrifuge. Membranes were prepared by homogenization of<br>
the cell pellets in 300 mL 50 mM Tris buffer, pH 7.4 with a Tekmar® homogenizer for<br>
10-15 seconds, followed by centrifugation at 12,000 RPM (20,000 x g) for 30 minutes<br>
using a Beckman JA-14® rotor. The pellets were washed once using the above procedure,<br>
and the final pellets were resuspended in 100-120 mL 50 mM Tris buffer, pH 7.4, and 4<br>
ml aliquots stored frozen at -70 °C. The protein concentration of this preparation was 2<br>
mg/mL.<br>
For the receptor binding assay, one 4-mL aliquot of the CHO-hNK-2R<br>
membrane preparation was suspended in 40 mL of assay buffer containing 50 mM Tris,<br>
pH 7.4, 3 mM manganese chloride, 0.02% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and 4 µg/mL<br>
chymostatin. A 200 µL volume of the homogenate (40 ug protein) was used per sample.<br>
The radioactive ligand was [l25I]iodohistidyl-neurokinin A (New England Nuclear,<br>
NEX-252), 2200 Ci/mmol. The ligand was prepared in assay buffer at 20 nCi per 100<br>
uL; the final concentration in the assay was 20 pM. Non-specific binding was<br>
determined using 1 µM eledoisin. Ten concentrations of eledoisin from 0.1 to 1000 nM<br>
were used for a standard concentration-response curve.<br>
All samples and standards were added to the incubation in 10 µL<br>
dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) for screening (single dose) or in 5 µL DMSO for IC50<br>
determinations. The order of additions for incubation was 190 or 195 µL assay buffer,<br>
200 µL homogenate, 10 or 5 µL sample in DMSO, 100 µL radioactive ligand. The<br>
samples were incubated 1 hr at room temperature and then filtered on a cell harvester<br>
through filters which had been presoaked for two hours in 50 mM Tris buffer, pH 7.7,<br>
containing 0.5% BSA. The filter was washed 3 times with approximately 3 mL of cold<br>
50 mM Tris buffer, pH 7.7. The filter circles were then punched into 12 x 75 mm<br>
polystyrene tubes and counted in a gamma counter.<br>
Tachykinin receptor antagonists are of value in the treatment of a wide<br>
variety of clinical conditions which are characterized by the presence of an excess of<br>
tachykinin. These clinical conditions may include disorders of the central nervous system<br>
such as anxiety, depression, psychosis, and schizophrenia; neurodegenerative disorders<br>
such as dementia, including senile dementia of the Alzheimer's type, Alzheimer's<br>
disease, AIDS-associated dementia, and Down's syndrome; demyelinating diseases such<br>
as multiple sclerosis and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and other neuropathological<br>
disorders such as peripheral neuropathy, such as diabetic and chemotherapy-induced<br>
neuropathy, and post-herpetic and other neuralgias; acute and chronic obstructive airway<br>
diseases such as adult respiratory distress syndrome, bronchopneumonia, bronchospasm,<br>
chronic bronchitis, drivercough, and asthma; inflammatory diseases such as inflammatory<br>
bowel disease, psoriasis, fibrositis, osteoarthritis, and rheumatoid arthritis; disorders of<br>
the musculo-skeletal system, such as osteoporosis; allergies such as eczema and rhinitis;<br>
hypersensitivity disorders such as poison ivy; ophthalmic diseases such as conjunctivitis,<br>
vernal conjunctivitis, and the like; cutaneous diseases such as contact dermatitis, atopic<br>
dermatitis, urticaria, and other eczematoid dermatites; addiction disorders such as<br>
alcoholism; stress-related somatic disorders; reflex sympathetic dystrophy such as<br>
shoulder/hand syndrome; dysthymic disorders; adverse immunological reactions such as<br>
rejection of transplanted tissues and disorders related to immune enhancement or<br>
suppression such as systemic lupus erythematosis; gastrointestinal disorders or diseases<br>
associated with the neuronal control of viscera such as ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease,<br>
emesis, and irritable bowel syndrome; disorders of bladder function such as bladder<br>
detrusor hyper-reflexia and incontinence; artherosclerosis; fibrosing and collagen diseases<br>
such as scleroderma and eosinophilic fascioliasis; irritative symptoms of benign prostatic<br>
hypertrophy; disorders of blood flow caused by vasodilation and vasospastic diseases<br>
such as angina, migraine, and Raynaud's disease; and pain or nociception, for example,<br>
that attributable to or associated with any of the foregoing conditions, especially the<br>
transmission of pain in migraine.<br>
NK-1 antagonists are useful in the treatment of pain, especially chronic<br>
pain, such as neuropathic pain, post-operative pain, and migraines, pain associated with<br>
arthritis, cancer-associated pain, chronic lower back pain, cluster headaches, herpes<br>
neuralgia, phantom limb pain, central pain, dental pain, neuropathic pain, opioid-resistant<br>
pain, visceral pain, surgical pain, bone injury pain, pain during labor and delivery, pain<br>
resulting from burns, including sunburn, post partum pain, angina pain, and genitourinary<br>
tract-related pain including cystitis.<br>
In addition to pain, NK-1 antagonists are especially useful in the treatment<br>
and prevention of urinary incontinence; irritative symptoms of benign prostatic<br>
hypertrophy; motility disorders of the gastrointestinal tract, such as irritable bowel<br>
syndrome; acute and chronic obstructive airway diseases, such as bronchospasm,<br>
bronchopneumonia, asthma, and adult respiratory distress syndrome; artherosclerosis;<br>
inflammatory conditions, such as inflammatory bowel disease, ulcerative colitis, Crohn's<br>
disease, rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, neurogenic inflammation, allergies, rhinitis,<br>
cough, dermatitis, urticaria, psoriasis, conjunctivitis, emesis, irritation-induced miosis,<br>
tissue transplant rejection; plasma extravasation resulting from cytokine chemotherapy<br>
and the like; spinal cord trauma; stroke; cerebral stroke (ischemia); Alzheimer's disease;<br>
Parkinson's disease; multiple sclerosis; amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; schizophrenia;<br>
anxiety; and depression.<br>
NK-2 antagonists are useful in the treatment of urinary incontinence,<br>
bronchospasm, asthma, adult respiratory distress syndrome, motility disorders of the<br>
gastrointestinal tract, such as irritable bowel syndrome, and pain.<br>
In addition to the above indications the compounds of the invention may<br>
be useful in the treatment of emesis, including acute, delayed, or anticipatory emesis,<br>
such as emesis induced by chemotherapy, radiation, toxins, pregnancy, vestibular<br>
disorders, motion, surgery, migraine, and variations in intercranial pressure. Most<br>
especially, the compounds of formula I are of use in the treatment of emesis induced by<br>
antineoplastic (cytotoxic) agents including those routinely used in cancer chemotherapy.<br>
Examples of such chemotherapeutic agents include alkylating agents, for<br>
example, nitrogen mustards, ethyleneimine compounds, alkyl sulfonates, and other<br>
compounds with an alkylating action, such as nitrosoureas, cisplatin, and dacarbazine;<br>
antimetabolites, for example, folic acid, purine, or pyrimidine antagonists; mitotic<br>
inhibitors, for example vinca alkaloids and derivatives of podophyllotoxin; and cytotoxic<br>
antibiotics.<br>
Particular examples of chemotherapeutic agents are described, for<br>
instance, by D.J. Stewart in NAUSEA AND VOMITING: RECENT RESEARCH AND CLINICAL<br>
ADVANCES, (J. Kucharczyk et al, eds., 1991), at pages 177-203. Commonly used<br>
chemotherapeutic agents include cisplatin, dacarbazine (DTIC), dactinomycin,<br>
mechlorethamine (nitrogen mustard), streptozocin, cyclophosphamide, carmustine<br>
(BCNU), lomustine (CCNU), doxorubicin, daunorubicin, procarbazine, mitomycin,<br>
cytarabine, etoposide, methotrexate, 5-fluorouracil, vinblastine, vincristine, bleomycin,<br>
and chlorambucil. R.J. Gralla et al, Cancer Treatment Reports, 68, 163-172 (1984).<br>
The compounds of formula I may also be of use in the treatment of emesis<br>
induced by radiation, including radiation therapy such as in the treatment of cancer, or<br>
radiation sickness; and in the treatment of post-operaive nausea and vomiting.<br>
While it is possible to administer a compound employed in the methods of<br>
this invention directly without any formulation, the compounds are usually administered<br>
in the form of pharmaceutical compositions comprising a pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
excipient and at least one active ingredient. These compositions can be administered by<br>
a variety of routes including oral, rectal, transdermal, subcutaneous, intravenous,<br>
intramuscular, and intranasal. Many of the compounds employed in the methods of this<br>
invention are effective as both injectable and oral compositions. Such compositions are<br>
prepared in a manner well known in the pharmaceutical art and comprise at least one<br>
active compound. See, e.g., REMINGTON'S PHARMACEUTICAL SCIENCES, (16th ed.<br>
1980).<br>
In making the compositions employed in the present invention the active<br>
ingredient is usually mixed with an excipient, diluted by an excipient, or enclosed within<br>
such a carrier which can be in the form of a capsule, sachet, paper, or other container.<br>
When the excipient serves as a diluent, it can be a solid, semi-solid, or liquid material,<br>
which acts as a vehicle, carrier or medium for the active ingredient. Thus, the<br>
compositions can be in the form of tablets, pills, powders, lozenges, sachets, cachets,<br>
elixirs, suspensions, emulsions, solutions, syrups, aerosols (as a solid or in a liquid<br>
medium), ointments containing for example up to 10% by weight of the active<br>
compound, soft and hard gelatin capsules, suppositories, sterile injectable solutions, and<br>
sterile packaged powders.<br>
In preparing a formulation, it may be necessary to mill the active<br>
compound to provide the appropriate particle size prior to combining with the other<br>
ingredients. If the active compound is substantially insoluble, it ordinarily is milled to a<br>
particle size of less than 200 mesh. If the active compound is substantially water soluble,<br>
the particle size is normally adjusted by milling to provide a substantially uniform<br>
distribution in the formulation, e.g. about 40 mesh.<br>
Some examples of suitable excipients include lactose, dextrose, sucrose,<br>
sorbitol, mannitol, starches, gum acacia, calcium phosphate, alginates, tragacanth, gelatin,<br>
calcium silicate, microcrystalline cellulose, polyvinylpyrrolidone, cellulose, water, syrup,<br>
and methyl cellulose. The formulations can additionally include: lubricating agents such<br>
as talc, magnesium stearate, and mineral oil; wetting agents; emulsifying and suspending<br>
agents; preserving agents such as methyl- and propylhydroxybenzoates; sweetening<br>
agents; and flavoring agents. The compositions of the invention can be formulated so as<br>
to provide quick, sustained or delayed release of the active ingredient after administration<br>
to the patient by employing procedures known in the art.<br>
The compositions are preferably formulated in a unit dosage form, each<br>
dosage containing from about 0.05 to about 100 mg, more usually about 1.0 to about 30<br>
mg, of the active ingredient. The term "unit dosage form" refers to physically discrete<br>
units suitable as unitary dosages for human subjects and other mammals, each unit<br>
containing a predetermined quantity of active material calculated to produce the desired<br>
therapeutic effect, in association with a suitable pharmaceutical excipient.<br>
The active compounds are generally effective over a wide dosage range.<br>
For examples, dosages per day normally fall within the range of about 0.01 to about 30<br>
mg/kg of body weight. In the treatment of adult humans, the range of about 0.1 to about<br>
15 mg/kg/day, in single or divided dose, is especially preferred. However, it will be<br>
understood that the amount of the compound actually administered will be determined by<br>
a physician, in the light of the relevant circumstances, including the condition to be<br>
treated, the chosen route of administration, the actual compound or compounds<br>
administered, the age, weight, and response of the individual patient, and the severity of<br>
the patient's symptoms, and therefore the above dosage ranges are not intended to limit<br>
the scope of the invention in any way. In some instances dosage levels below the lower<br>
limit of the aforesaid range may be more than adequate, while in other cases still larger<br>
doses may be employed without causing any harmful side effect, provided that such larger<br>
doses are first divided into several smaller doses for administration throughout the day.<br>

55 °C and the medicament is slowly admixed. The homogenous mixture is poured into<br>
forms made of an inert material to produce a drug-containing diffusion matrix having a<br>
thickness of about 2-4 mm. This diffusion matrix is then cut to form individual tablets<br>
having the appropriate size.<br>
Another preferred formulation employed in the methods of the present<br>
invention employs transdermal delivery devices ("patches"). Such transdermal patches<br>
may be used to provide continuous or discontinuous infusion of the compounds of the<br>
present invention in controlled amounts. The construction and use of transdermal patches<br>
for the delivery of pharmaceutical agents is well known in the art. See, e.g.. U.S. Patent<br>
No. 5,023,252, issued June 11, 1991, herein incorporated by reference. Such patches may<br>
be constructed for continuous, pulsatile, or on demand delivery of pharmaceutical agents.<br>
Frequently, it will be desirable or necessary to introduce the<br>
pharmaceutical composition to the brain, either directly or indirectly. Direct techniques<br>
usually involve placement of a drug delivery catheter into the host's ventricular system to<br>
bypass the blood-brain barrier. One such implantable delivery system, used for the<br>
transport of biological factors to specific anatomical regions of the body, is described in<br>
U.S. Patent No. 5,011,472, which is herein incorporated by reference.<br>
Indirect techniques, which are generally preferred, usually involve<br>
formulating the compositions to provide for drug latentiation by the conversion of<br>
hydrophilic drugs into lipid-soluble drugs or prodrugs. Latentiation is generally achieved<br>
through blocking of the hydroxy, carbonyl, sulfate, and primary amine groups present on<br>
the drug to render the drug more lipid soluble and amenable to transportation across the<br>
blood-brain barrier. Alternatively, the delivery of hydrophilic drugs may be enhanced by<br>
intra-arterial infusion of hypertonic solutions that can transiently open the blood-brain<br>
barrier.<br>
The type of formulation employed for the administration of the<br>
compounds employed in the methods of the present invention may be dictated by the<br>
particular compounds employed, the type of pharmacokinetic profile desired from the<br>
route of administration and the compound(s), and the state of the patient.<br>
While the invention has been illustrated and described in detail in the<br>
foregoing description, such an illustration and description is to be considered as<br>
exemplary and not restrictive in character, it being understood that only the illustrative<br>
embodiments have been shown and described and that all changes and modifications that<br>
come within the spirit of the invention are desired to be protected.<br>
