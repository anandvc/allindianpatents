				<td>MONOPHASIC PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOSITION CONTAINING DEVAZEPIDE<br>
This invention relates to a novel monophasic pharmaceutical composition containing devazepide.<br>
International Patent Application No. WO 99/18967 describes -pharmaceutical compositions for treating chronic and neuropathic pain which comprises an analgesic amount of an opioid and an opioid potentiating amount of a CCK antagonist WO 967 describes the use of both CCK-A (CCK-1) antagonists and CCK-B (CCK-2) antagonists, although it is described that, generally, CCK-B (CCK-2) antagonists are preferred Moreover, page 2, lines 6 to 8 of WO '967 describes (hat CCK-A (CCK-1) antagonists may be suitable, but only at relatively higher dosages.<br>
One specific CCK-A (CCK-1) antagonist which is mentioned in WO 99/18967 is devazepide (Devacade®), which is 3s-(-)-l,3-dihydro-3-(2-indolecarbonylammo)-l-methyl-5-phenyl-2H-l ,4-benzodiazepin-2-one.<br>
Devazepide is commonly administered alongside an opioid analgesic, e.g. such as morphine. However, in normal doses, the commonest side-effects of morphine and other opioid analgesics are nausea, vomiting, constipation, drowsiness, and -confusion; tolerance generally develops with long-term use, but not to constipation which is the most common undesirable side effect of morphine treatment<br>
International Patent Application No. WO 99/18967 specifically describes a pharmaceutical formulation comprising a CCK antagonist, such as devazepide, an opioid and a biphasic carder, comprising a glyceride derivative organic phase. This application suggests the possible use of a surfactant, especially when the formulation is in the form of an oil-m-water emulsion.<br>
We have now surprisingly found that a method of treatment of a patient requiring analgesia which comprises administering a monophasic form of devazepide which may be prepared .with a surfactant The use of a surfactant is advantageous in that,<br>
inter alia, it improves the powder flow and/or separation properties of solid devazepide and also reduces or mitigates the undesirable side effects of opioid administration, e.g. constipation.<br>
Thus, according to the invention there is provided a monophasic pharmaceutical composition for treatment of a patient requiring analgesia which composition, upon separate, simultaneous or sequential administration, provides a therapeutically effective amount of an opioid analgesic, devazepide and a pharmaceutically acceptable surfactant wherein the daily dosage of devazepide is up to 0.7 mg/kg/day.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a monophasic pharmaceutical composition comprising a therapeutically effective amount of devazepide and a pharmaceutically acceptable surfactant wherein the daily dosage of devazepide is up to 0.7 mg/kg/day, the surfactant being selected from the group consisting of alkyl sulphosuccinates, alkyl sulphates and alkyl ammonium salts.<br>
The devazepide and the pharmaceutically acceptable surfactant are in a monophasic form, e.g.- solid or liquid form. Preferably, the devazepide and the pharmaceutically acceptable surfactant are in a monophasic form, eg a liquid form or a solid dosage form. The phrase solid dosage form may mean, for example, in tablet form or,-preferably in the-form of a flowable powder in a capsule. We have found that the use of a surfactant in a solid dose devazepide composition as hereinbefore described has the advantage of mitigating constipation due to the concomitant administration of aa opioid analgesic, whilst also improving the physical properties of devazepide in a solid dose formulation,<br>
Any conventionally known pharmaceutically acceptable surfactants may be used in the method of the invention. Such surfactants include, but shall not be limited to, a lipophilic surfactant hydrophilic surfactant or a glyceride, or combinations thereof.<br>

In a further embodiment of the invention the surfactant may also posse antimicrobial and/or antiseptic properties. Thus, for example, when the surfactant tetradecyltrimethylammonium bromide, it may, preferentially, be cetrimic (cetrimide is a mixture substantially comprising tetradecyltrimethyl ammonia bromide and -small amounts of dodecyltrimethylammonium bromide an cetrimonium bromide).<br>
In the most preferred embodiment of the invention the surfactant is docusate sodium<br>
The method of the invention may preferentially comprise the use of a compositic which comprises one or more fillers, Thus, such fillers may be selected from th group lactose, mannitol, talc, magnesium stearate, sodium chloride, potassium chloride, citric acid, spray-dried lactose, hydrolysed starches, directly compressib starch, microcrystalline cellulose, cllulosics, sorbitol, sucrose, sucrose-base materials, icodextrin, calcium sulphate, dibasic calcium, phosphate and dextrose, . preferred filler is starch, e.g. com starch.<br>
When the method of the invention comprises the use of a composition which includes a filler, the size of the devazepide and filler particles may be title same c<br>
different However, in a preferred embodiment the sizes of the devazepide and filler particles will differ. Preferentially, the devazepide, surfactant and/or the filler may be of reduced particle size, e.g. by milling,<br>
The devazepide, surfactant and filler may be present as an intimate mixture. However, in a preferred embodiment the filler particles may be coated 'with the surfactant, the coated filler and devazepide then being formed into an intimate mixture.<br>
The method of the invention wherein the compositions, comprising devazepide, a filler and a surfactant are especially advantageous in that, inter alia, the surfactant acts to hinder or prevent separation of the devazepide and the filler. Furthermore, in one embodiment of the invention the surfactant may also have desirable laxative and/or stool softening properties.<br>
The amount of surfactant present in the composition used in the method of the invention may vary, depending upon, inter alia, the level of devazepide present, the level of concomitant opioid analgesic administered, etc. Generally, the ratio of devazepide:surfactant may be from 5:1 to 25:1 w/w, preferably from 10:1 to 15:1 w/w, most preferably 12.5:1 w/w.<br>
When the composition used in the method of the invention includes a filler, the composition may generally comprise devazepide and a surfactant, in the ratio as hereinbefore described, with the remainder of the composition being made up with a filler.<br>
A preferred embodiment of the invention comprises a method wherein a composition as hereinbefore described is filled into a capsule. Any conventionally known materials may be used for the capsule, however a preferred material is gelatin.<br>
Thus, for example, in one embodiment of the invention the composition as hereinbefore described may be made up into a capsule formulation, e.g. with a fill<br>
weight of 150 mg ± 5% by weight or 300 mg ± 5% by weight i the one preferred embodiment, the capsule formulation may comprise 1.25mg devazepide, 0.1 mg surfactant, e.g. docusate sodium, and 148.65 mg of a filler, e.g. com starch. In. a further preferred embodiment, the capsule formulation may comprise 2,5mg devazepide, 0.2 mg surfactant, e.g. docusate sodium, and 297,3 mg of a tiller, e.g. com starch-According to a further aspect of the invention we provide the use of devazepide in the manufacture of a pharmaceutical composition comprising a therapeutically effective amount of devazepide and apharmaceutically acceptable surfactant<br><br>
The use of the invention is preferentially the use in the manufacture of a pharmaceutical composition wherein the composition comprises any of the aspects of the methods hereinbefore described. The use as hereinbefore described preferentially comprises the use in the manufacture of a pharmaceutical composition in monophasic form.<br>
By the term therapeutically effective amount of devazepide we generally mean an amount of devazepide effective in the enhancement of opioid analgesia.<br>
In the method of the invention a variety of opioids may be used. Thus, the opioid may be selected from those which are effective analgesics and particularly those which need to be administered at relatively high or increasing doses. Examples include morphine, or a salt thereof such as the sulphate, chloride or hydrochloride, or the other 1,4-hydroxymorphinan opioid analgesics such as naloxone, meperidine, butorphanol or pentazocine, or morphine-6-glucuronide, codeine, dihydrocodeine, diamorphine, dextropropoxyphene, pethidine, fentanyl, alfentanil, alphaprodine, buprenorphine, dextromoramide, diphenoxylate, dipipanone, heroin (diacetylmorphine), hydrocodone (dihydrocodeinone), hydromorphone (dihydromorphinone), levorphanol, meptazinol, methadone, metopon (methyldihydromorphine), nalbuphine, oxycodone (dihydrohydroxycodemone), oxymorphone (dihydrohydroxymorphinone), phenadoxone, phenazocine,<br>
remifentanil tramadol, or a salt of any of these. the opioid used in the method of the invention may comprise any combination of the aforementioned compounds. Naloxone is also included within the definition of am opioid. Especially preferred analgesics which may be mentioned are hydromorphone, oxycodone, morphine, e.g. morphine sulphate and fentanyl. In a preferred embodiment of the invention the analgesic is morphine or morphine sulphate. in a further preferred embodiment the opioid is fentanyl or a salt thereof.<br>
ln the method of the invention the devazepide and/or the opioid may be administered using any methods conventionally knownper se. Thus, such methods would include, but shall not be limited to, administration intravenously, intra-arterially, orally, intrathecally, intranasally, intrarectally, intramuscularly/subcutaneously, by inhalation and by transdermal patch. When the devazepide and/or opioid is administered intravenously, it may, for example, be as an intravenous bolus 0r a continuous intravenous infusion, Whea the devazepide and/or the opioid is administered subcutaneously, it may for example be by subcutaneous infusion. Preferably, tie opioid and/or devazepide are administered intravenously or orally. Oral administration is especially preferred. In a further preferred embodiment the opioid may be administered by a transdermal patch. When a transdermal patch is used, the preferred opioid is fentanyl or a salt thereof.<br>
Thus, in the method of the invention the daily dosage of devazepide may vary depending upon, inter alia, the weight of the patient, the method of administration, etc. In patients that are suffering serious disorders, such as cancer patients, the weight of the patient may be very low and therefore; the dosage of devazepide consequentially may be low. Preferably, the daily dosage of devazepide may be from 25 ug/kg/day to 0.7 mg/kg/day, more preferably from 50 ug/kg/day to 0.5 mg/kg/day. For oral administration the daily dosage of devazepide may be from 0.07 mg/kg/day to 0.7 mg/kg/day, preferably 0.07 mg/kg/day to 0.29 mg/kg/day. For intravenous administration the dosage of devazepide is preferably 50 ug/kg/day to 0.5 mg/kg/day.<br>
Thus, the expected daily dose of surfactant, which may optionally have laxative and/or stool softening properties, may be up to 0.056 mg/kg/day. Thus, dependant upon the patient, the daily dosage of surfactant may be from 0,4mg to 1.6mg, preferably 0.8mg. Most preferably, the surfactant will be one which, posses both laxative and stool softening properties,<br>
ln the method of the invention the dosage of the opioid analgesic administered may vary depending upon, inter alia, the nature of the opioid analgesic, the weight of the patient, the method of administration, etc. Thus, for example, the dosage of, e.g. an opioid, such as morphine, may be from 5 to 2000mg daily. A particular dosage which may be mentioned is from 10 to 240mg daily. A daily dosage of morphine may be from 5 to 100mg or occasionally up to 500mg.<br>
According to a yet further aspect of the invention we provide a monophasic pharmaceutical composition comprising an amount of devazepide effective in the enhancement of opioid analgesia and a pharmaceutically acceptable surfactant.<br>
