				<td>[0001]    This application is a continuation-in-part application and claims priority to and benefit under 35 U.S.C. § 120 to U.S. Application Serial No. 12/209,928, filed September 12, 2008, which claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application Serial No. 61/017,480, filed December 28, 2007. This application also claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application Serial No. 61/017,391, filed December 28, 2007. The contents of all of these applications are expressly incorporated fully herein by reference in their entirety.<br>
[0002]    The claimed invention was made by, on behalf of, and/or in connection with one or more of the following parties to a joint university corporation research agreement: Regents of the University of Michigan, Princeton University, The University of Southern California, and the Universal Display Corporation. The agreement was in effect on and before the date the claimed invention was made, and the claimed invention was made as a result of activities undertaken within the scope of the agreement.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION [0003]    The present invention relates to novel organic materials containing carbazole. In particular, the materials contain an oligocarbazole. The materials may be useful in organic light emitting devices (OLEDs).<br>
BACKGROUND [0004]    Opto-electronic devices that make use of organic materials are becoming increasingly desirable for a number of reasons. Many of the materials used to make such devices are relatively inexpensive, so organic opto-electronic devices have the potential for cost advantages over inorganic devices. In addition, the inherent properties of organic materials, such as their flexibility, may make them well suited for particular applications such as fabrication on a flexible substrate. Examples of organic opto-electronic devices include organic light emitting devices (OLEDs), organic phototransistors, organic photovoltaic cells, and organic photodetectors. For OLEDs, the organic materials may have performance advantages over conventional materials. For example, the wavelength at which an organic emissive layer emits light may generally be readily tuned with appropriate dopants.<br>
[0005]    OLEDs make use of thin organic films that emit light when voltage is applied across the device. OLEDs are becoming an increasingly interesting technology for use in applications such as flat panel displays, illumination, and backlighting. Several OLED materials and configurations are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,844,363, 6,303,238, and 5,707,745, which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.<br>
[0006]    One application for phosphorescent emissive molecules is a full color display. Industry standards for such a display call for pixels adapted to emit particular colors, referred to as "saturated" colors. In particular, these standards call for saturated red, green, and blue pixels. Color may be measured using CIE coordinates, which are well known to the art.<br>
[0007]    One example of a green emissive molecule is tris(2-phenylpyridine) iridium, denoted Ir(ppy)3, which has the structure of Formula I:<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
[0008]    In this, and later figures herein, we depict the dative bond from nitrogen to metal (here, Ir) as a straight line.<br>
[0009]    As used herein, the term "organic" includes polymeric materials as well as small molecule organic materials that may be used to fabricate organic opto-electronic devices. "Small molecule" refers to any organic material that is not a polymer, and "small molecules" may actually be quite large. Small molecules may include repeat units in some circumstances. For example, using a long chain alkyl group as a substituent does not remove a molecule from the "small molecule" class. Small molecules may also be incorporated into polymers, for example as a pendent group on a polymer backbone or as a part of the backbone. Small molecules may also serve as the core moiety of a dendrimer, which consists of a series of chemical shells built on the core moiety. The core moiety of a dendrimer may be a fluorescent or phosphorescent small molecule emitter. A dendrimer may be a "small molecule," and it is believed that all dendrimers currently used in the field of OLEDs are small molecules.<br>
[0010]    As used herein, "top" means furthest away from the substrate, while "bottom" means closest to the substrate. Where a first layer is described as "disposed over" a second<br>
layer, the first layer is disposed further away from substrate. There may be other layers between the first and second layer, unless it is specified that the first layer is "in contact with" the second layer. For example, a cathode may be described as "disposed over" an anode, even though there are various organic layers in between.<br>
[0011]    As used herein, "solution processible" means capable of being dissolved, dispersed, or transported in and/or deposited from a liquid medium, either in solution or suspension form.<br>
[0012]    A ligand is referred to as "photoactive" when it is believed that the ligand contributes to the photoactive properties of an emissive material.<br>
[0013]    As used herein, the term "triplet energy" refers to an energy corresponding to the highest energy feature discernable in the phosphorescence spectrum of a given material. The highest energy feature is not necessarily the peak having the greatest intensity in the phosphorescence spectrum, and could, for example, be a local maximum of a clear shoulder on the high energy side of such a peak. Triplet energy is described in detail in US Patent No. 7,279,704 at col. 6, which is incorporated by reference.<br>
[0014]    More details on OLEDs, and the definitions described above, can be found in US Pat. No. 7,279,704, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION [0015]    A new class of carbazole-containing compounds are provided. In particular, compounds having a monodisperse linear 3,9-linked oligocarbazolyl (herein referred to as "oligocarbazole") are provided.<br>
[0016]    The carbazole-containing compounds described herein have the formula:<br>

Preferably, a is 1 to 20 and n is 0.<br>
[0017]    Examples of particular carbazole-containing materials include Compounds 1G-79G, as disclosed herein.<br>
[0018]    Additionally, an organic light emitting device is provided. The device has an anode, a cathode, and a first organic layer disposed between the anode and the cathode. The first organic layer further comprises an carbazole-containing compound having FORMULA I. Preferably the first organic layer is an emissive layer having a host and a phosphorescent emitter, and the carbazole-containing compound is the host. The device may contain 10-100 wt% of the carbazole-containing compound in an organic layer. Preferably, the carbazole-containing compound is present in an emissive layer at a concentration of 40 - 99.9 wt% and the emissive layer further comprises a phosphorescent emitter having a concentration of 0.1 -30 wt%.<br>
[0019]    Moreover, the device may further comprise a non-emissive second organic layer and the carbazole-containing compound may also preferably be used as a material in the second layer of such a device.<br>
[0020]    A consumer product is also provided. The product contains a device that has an anode, a cathode, and an organic layer disposed between the anode and the cathode, where the organic layer further comprises a carbazole-containing compound having FORMULA I.<br>
[0021]    A method of fabricating an organic light emitting device is also provided. The method includes providing a first electrode, co-depositing a host and a phosphorescent emitter to form an emissive layer wherein the emissive layer comprises a carbazole-containing compound having FORMULA I, and depositing a second electrode. The first electrode may be an anode and the second electrode may be a cathode. An organic layer, preferably a hole transport layer, may be deposited after the anode and before the emissive layer.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS [0022]    FIG. 1 shows an organic light emitting device.<br>
[0023]    FIG. 2 shows an inverted organic light emitting device that does not have a separate electron transport layer.<br>
[0024]    FIG. 3 shows an oligocarbazole-containing compound.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION [0025]    Generally, an OLED comprises at least one organic layer disposed between and electrically connected to an anode and a cathode. When a current is applied, the anode injects holes and the cathode injects electrons into the organic layer(s). The injected holes and electrons each migrate toward the oppositely charged electrode. When an electron and hole localize on the same molecule, an "exciton," which is a localized electron-hole pair having an excited energy state, is formed. Light is emitted when the exciton relaxes via a photoemissive mechanism. In some cases, the exciton may be localized on an excimer or an exciplex. Non-radiative mechanisms, such as thermal relaxation, may also occur, but are generally considered undesirable.<br>
[0026]    The initial OLEDs used emissive molecules that emitted light from their singlet states ("fluorescence") as disclosed, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 4,769,292, which is incorporated by reference in its entirety. Fluorescent emission generally occurs in a time frame of less than 10 nanoseconds.<br>
[0027]    More recently, OLEDs having emissive materials that emit light from triplet states ("phosphorescence") have been demonstrated. Baldo et al., "Highly Efficient Phosphorescent<br>
Emission from Organic Electroluminescent Devices," Nature, vol. 395, 151-154, 1998; ("Baldo-I") and Baldo et al., "Very high-efficiency green organic light-emitting devices based on electrophosphorescence," AppL Phys. Lett., vol. 75, No. 3,4-6 (1999) ("Baldo-H"), which are incorporated by reference in their entireties. Phosphorescence is described in more detail in US Pat. No. 7,279,704 at cols. 5-6, which are incorporated by reference.<br>
[0028]    FIG. 1 shows an organic light emitting device 100. The figures are not necessarily drawn to scale. Device 100 may include a substrate 110, an anode 115, a hole injection layer 120, a hole transport layer 125, an electron blocking layer 130, an emissive layer 135, a hole blocking layer 140, an electron transport layer 145, an electron injection layer 150, a protective layer 155, and a cathode 160. Cathode 160 is a compound cathode having a first conductive layer 162 and a second conductive layer 164. Device 100 may be fabricated by depositing the layers described, in order. The properties and functions of these various layers, as well as example materials, are described in more detail in US 7,279,704 at cols. 6-10, which are incorporated by reference.<br>
[0029]    More examples for each of these layers are available. For example, a flexible and transparent substrate-anode combination is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,844,363, which is incorporated by reference in its entirety. An example of a p-doped hole transport layer is m-MTDATA doped with F.sub.4-TCNQ at a molar ratio of 50:1, as disclosed in U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2003/0230980, which is incorporated by reference in its entirety. Examples of emissive and host materials are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,303,238 to Thompson et al., which is incorporated by reference in its entirety. An example of an n-doped electron transport layer is BPhen doped with Li at a molar ratio of 1:1, as disclosed in U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2003/0230980, which is incorporated by reference in its entirety. U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,703,436 and 5,707,745, which are incorporated by reference in their entireties, disclose examples of cathodes including compound cathodes having a thin layer of metal such as Mg:Ag with an overlying transparent, electrically-conductive, sputter-deposited ITO layer. The theory and use of blocking layers is described in more detail in U.S. Pat. No. 6,097,147 and U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2003/0230980, which are incorporated by reference in their entireties. Examples of injection layers are provided in U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2004/0174116, which is incorporated by reference in its entirety. A description of protective layers may be found in U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2004/0174116, which is incorporated by reference in its entirety.<br>
[0030]    FIG. 2 shows an inverted OLED 200. The device includes a substrate 210, a cathode 215, an emissive layer 220, a hole transport layer 225, and an anode 230. Device 200 may be fabricated by depositing the layers described, in order. Because the most common OLED configuration has a cathode disposed over the anode, and device 200 has cathode 215 disposed under anode 230, device 200 may be referred to as an "inverted" OLED. Materials similar to those described with respect to device 100 may be used in the corresponding layers of device 200. FIG. 2 provides one example of how some layers may be omitted from the structure of device 100.<br>
[0031]    The simple layered structure illustrated in FIGS. 1 and 2 is provided by way of non-limiting example, and it is understood that embodiments of the invention may be used in connection with a wide variety of other structures. The specific materials and structures described are exemplary in nature, and other materials and structures may be used. Functional OLEDs may be achieved by combining the various layers described in different ways, or layers may be omitted entirely, based on design, performance, and cost factors. Other layers not specifically described may also be included. Materials other than those specifically described may be used. Although many of the examples provided herein describe various layers as comprising a single material, it is understood that combinations of materials, such as a mixture of host and dopant, or more generally a mixture, may be used. Also, the layers may have various sublayers. The names given to the various layers herein are not intended to be strictly limiting. For example, in device 200, hole transport layer 225 transports holes and injects holes into emissive layer 220, and may be described as a hole transport layer or a hole injection layer. In one embodiment, an OLED may be described as having an "organic layer" disposed between a cathode and an anode. This organic layer may comprise a single layer, or may further comprise multiple layers of different organic materials as described, for example, with respect to FIGS. 1 and 2.<br>
[0032]    Structures and materials not specifically described may also be used, such as OLEDs comprised of polymeric materials (PLEDs) such as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,247,190 to Friend et al., which is incorporated by reference in its entirety. By way of further example, OLEDs having a single organic layer may be used. OLEDs may be stacked, for example as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,707,745 to Forrest et al, which is incorporated by reference in its entirety. The OLED structure may deviate from the simple layered structure illustrated in FIGS. 1 and 2. For example, the substrate may include an angled reflective surface to improve out-coupling, such as a mesa structure as described in U.S. Pat. No.<br>
6,091,195 to Forrest et al., and/or a pit structure as described in U.S. Pat No. 5,834,893 to Bulovic et al., which are incorporated by reference in their entireties.<br>
[0033]    Unless otherwise specified, any of the layers of the various embodiments may be deposited by any suitable method. For the organic layers, preferred methods include thermal evaporation, ink-jet, such as described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,013,982 and 6,087,196, which are incorporated by reference in their entireties, organic vapor phase deposition (OVPD), such as described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,337,102 to Forrest et al., which is incorporated by reference in its entirety, and deposition by organic vapor jet printing (OVJP), such as described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/233,470, which is incorporated by reference in its entirety. Other suitable deposition methods include spin coating and other solution based processes. Solution based processes are preferably carried out in nitrogen or an inert atmosphere. For the other layers, preferred methods include thermal evaporation. Preferred patterning methods include deposition through a mask, cold welding such as described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,294,398 and 6,468,819, which are incorporated by reference in their entireties, and patterning associated with some of the deposition methods such as ink-jet and OVJD. Other methods may also be used. The materials to be deposited may be modified to make them compatible with a particular deposition method. For example, substituents such as alkyl and aryl groups, branched or unbranched, and preferably containing at least 3 carbons, may be used in small molecules to enhance their ability to undergo solution processing. Substituents having 20 carbons or more may be used, and 3-20 carbons is a preferred range. Materials with asymmetric structures may have better solution processibility than those having symmetric structures, because asymmetric materials may have a lower tendency to recrystallize. Dendrimer substituents may be used to enhance the ability of small molecules to undergo solution processing.<br>
[0034]    Devices fabricated in accordance with embodiments of the invention may be incorporated into a wide variety of consumer products, including flat panel displays, computer monitors, televisions, billboards, lights for interior or exterior illumination and/or signaling, heads up displays, fully transparent displays, flexible displays, laser printers, telephones, cell phones, personal digital assistants (PDAs), laptop computers, digital cameras, camcorders, viewfinders, micro-displays, vehicles, a large area wall, theater or stadium screen, or a sign. Various control mechanisms may be used to control devices fabricated in accordance with the present invention, including passive matrix and active matrix. Many of<br>
the devices are intended for use in a temperature range comfortable to humans, such as 18 degrees C. to 30 degrees C, and more preferably at room temperature (20-25 degrees C).<br>
[0035]    The materials and structures described herein rnay have applications in devices other than OLEDs. For example, other optoelectronic devices such as organic solar cells and organic photodetectors may employ the materials and structures. More generally, organic devices, such as organic transistors, may employ the materials and structures.<br>
[0036]    The terms halo, halogen, alkyl, cycloalkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, arylkyl, heterocyclic group, aryl, aromatic group, and heteroaryl are known to the art, and are defined in US 7,279,704 at cols. 31-32, which are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
[0037]    A new class of carbazole-containing compounds, which may be advantageously used in an OLED, are provided (also illustrated in FIG. 3). In particular, 3,9-linked oligocarbazolyl compounds ("oligocarbazole-containing compounds") are provided. Carbazole is a nitrogen containing heteroaromatic, having high triplet energy, and has hole transporting and electron transporting properties. One advantage to using carbazole-containing compounds as host materials is that they simultaneously possess sufficiently large triplet energies and carrier transport properties. The 3,9-linked oligocarbazole groups (i.e., carbazole groups that are linked para to the nitrogen) are monodisperse, well-defined n-conjugated oligomers that may be useful in OLEDs. There is a minimal reduction in the triplet energy in going from carbazole monomers to oligocarbazoles. In addition, oligomerization of the carbazole group allows for tuning of the HOMO level to improve hole stability.<br>
[0038]    The oligocarbazole-containing compounds described herein have a relatively low electrochemical oxidation potential. As such, these compounds are easier to oxidize and to reverse the oxidation, which improves overall host stability. In particular, the materials disclosed herein may have less than about 0.9 V, less than about 0.85 V, less than about 0.8 V, and less than 0.75 V oxidation relative to ferrocene/ferrocenium (vs. Fc+/Fc). It is thought that the asymmetrical arrangement of the compound around the carbazole provides the lower oxidation potential and reversible nature of the oxidation potential. As used herein, the term "asymmetrical" refers to the arrangement of chemical groups in the compound in such a way that is not symmetrical with respect to the carbazole portion of the compound.<br>
[0039]    In addition to improved charge balance and charge stability, the materials provided herein may also provide better film formation. In particular, materials having an<br>
asymmetrical structure, such as the 3, 9-linked oligocarbazole structure, may offer improved film formation. The improved film formation is believed to be a result of reduced crystallization due to the asymmetrical structure of the compound.<br>
[0040]    The carbazole-containing compounds described herein have the formula:<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
[0041]    Where a is 1 to 20, b is 0 to 20, m is 0 to 2, n is 0 to 2 and m+n is least 1.

[0042]    In one aspect, carbazole-containing compounds are provided wherein a is 1 to 20 and n is 0. In one aspect, particular carbazole-containing compounds are provided, wherein a is 1 or 2 and n is 0.<br>

The flask was filled with nitrogen, and the reaction mixture was heated to reflux and stirred under nitrogen atmosphere for 24 hours. Then reaction was cooled down to room temperature, filtered through silica plug and evaporated. The residue was subjected to column chromatography on silica gel, eluent hexane/ethyl acetate mixture 9:1, providing 2.0 g of coupling product as white solid. The structure was confirmed by NMR and MS spectroscopy.<br>
[0083]    Step 5. The white product was dissolved in 100 mL of THF, cooled in the dry ice/acetone bath and n-BuLi solution in hexane (1 equivalent) was added as one portion. After 1 hour, 5 mL of water were added as one portion and the reaction mixture was warmed up to room temperature, diluted with water and extracted with ethyl acetate. Evaporation followed by column chromatography on silica gel (hexane/ethyl acetate 9/1 mixture as eluent) provided 1.5 g of target compound as white solid. Structure was confirmed by NMR and MS data.<br>
Device Examples<br>
[0084]    All example devices were fabricated by high vacuum (
[0085]    Particular devices are provided wherein PI is the emissive dopant and invention compound, Compound 8, Compound 15, Compound 17 or Compound 17', is the host. The organic stack of Device Examples 1-4 consisted of, sequentially from the ITO surface, 100A<br>
of P2 as the hole injecting layer (HIL), 300 A of 4,4'-bis[N-(l-naphthyl)-N-phenylamino]biphenyl (α-NPD) as the hole transport layer (HTL), 300A of the invention compound doped with 9% of PI, an Ir phosphorescent compound, as the emissive layer (EML), 50A of the invention compound as ETL2 and 400A of Alq3 (tris-8-hydroxyquinoline aluminum) as the ETL1.<br>
[0086]    Comparative Example 1 was fabricated similarly to the Device Examples, except that mCBP was used as the host.<br>
[0087]    As used herein, the following compounds have the following structures:<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
[0088]    The device structures and data are summarized in Tables 2 and 3. Table 2 shows device structure, in particular the host materials for the emissive layer and the material for the ETL2. Table 3 shows the corresponding measured results for those devices. Cmpd is an abbreviation of Compound. The oxidation potentials (Eox) are designated as irreversible (i) or quasi-irreversible (q).<br>
Table 2.<br>
(Table Removed) <br>
[0089]    From Device Examples 1-4, it can be seen that devices using the invention compounds as hosts give improved device stability while maintaining high triplet energy. In particular, Compounds 8, 15, 17 or 17' as hosts in blue or green OLEDs give devices with reduced oxidation potentials (Eox vs Fc/Fc) and improved electrochemical reversibility indicating that the carbazole containing compounds, in particular the unsymmetrical monodisperse linear 3,9-linked oligocarbazole compounds, may provide better charge balance and charge stability in the device.<br>
[0090]    The data suggest that carbazole containing compounds, particularly 3,9-linked oligocarbazoles, are excellent hosts and enhancement layer materials for phosphorescent OLEDs, providing improved charge balance and charge stability compared to the commonly used mCBP host. In addition, the oligocarbazole containing compounds may also provide better film formation during device production due to the unsymmetrical nature of the molecules.<br>
[0091]    It is understood that the various embodiments described herein are by way of example only, and are not intended to limit the scope of the invention. For example, many of the materials and structures described herein may be substituted with other materials and structures without deviating from the spirit of the invention. The present invention as claimed may therefore includes variations from the particular examples and preferred embodiments described herein, as will be apparent to one of skill in the art.
