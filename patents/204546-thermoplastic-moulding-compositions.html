THE PATENTS RULES, 2003 COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10; rule 13]<br>
                        THERMOPLASTIC  MOULDINGCOMPOSITIONS"<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
BAYER AKTIENGESELLSCHAFT,  a German company,  of D-51368, Leverkusen, Germany,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br><br><br><br><br>
LeA33 285 KM/bo/NT-V11.11.98<br><br>
Flame-resistant polycarbonate-ABS moulding compositions<br><br>
The present invention relates to polycarbonate-ABS moulding compositions which have been given a flame-resistant treatment with phosphorus compounds and have an excellent profile of mechanical properties, in particular a significantly improved elongation at break, an outstanding modulus of elasticity in tension and excellent processing properties.<br>
EP-A-0 363 608 describes polymer mixtures of aromatic polycarbonate, styrene-containing copolymer or graft copolymer and oligomeric phosphates as flameproofing additives. The profile of mechanical properties and the processing properties of these mixtures are often inadequate for particular intended purposes.<br>
EP-A-0 704 488 describes moulding compositions of aromatic polycarbonate, styrene-containing copolymers and graft polymers with a specific graft base in particular ratios of amounts. These moulding compositions have a very good notched impact strength and can optionally be given a flame-resistant treatment with phosphorus compounds. The profile of properties is inadequate for the production of shaped articles of increased elasticity requirements and the required processing properties.<br>
  US-A 5 061 745 describes moulding compositions of aromatic polycarbonate, graft   polymer and monophosphates. The volatility of the monophosphates can cause severe impairment of the processing properties.<br>
EP-A 755 977 describes moulding compositions of aromatic polycarbonate, ABS graft polymers with a rubber content of 
 <br>
Le A 33 285<br>
achieve adequate flameproofing, the amount of flameproofing agent employed of max. 8 wt.% may be too low.<br>
The object of the present invention is to provide flame-resistant polycarbonate ABS moulding compositions which combine excellent mechanical properties, such as notched impact strength, elongation at break and resistance to stress cracking, with excellent processing properties (few surface defects, flowability, low contents of volatile components). This profile of properties corresponds to the trend towards ever thinner and therefore more lightweight components of housings.<br>
It has now been found that PC/ABS moulding compositions which comprise phosphorus compounds according to component D (see below) and graft polymer obtainable by bulk polymerization can be processed to shaped articles having a very good profile of mechanical properties.<br>
The present invention therefore provides flame-resistant thermoplastic moulding compositions based on polycarbonate and/or polyester-carbonate comprising graft polymer prepared by means of bulk, solution or bulk-suspension polymerization processes and, as flameproofing agents, phosphorus-containing compounds. The phosphorus compounds of the general formula (I) mentioned below as component D are employed as the phosphorus-containing compounds.<br>

Component B<br><br><br>
Le A 33 285<br><br><br><br>
The rubber-modified graft polymer B comprises a random (co)polymer of monomers according to B.l.l and/or B.1.2 and a rubber B.2 grafted with the random (co)polymer of B.l.l and/or B.1.2, the preparation of B being carried out in a known manner by a bulk or solution or bulk-suspension polymerization process, such as are described e.g. in US-3 243 481, US-3 509 237, US-3 660 535, US-4 221 833 and US-4 239 863.<br>
Examples of monomers B.l.l are styrene, a-methylstyrene, styrenes substituted on the nucleus by halogen or alkyl, such as p-methylstyrene and p-chlorostyrene, and (meth)acrylic acid C1-C8-alkyl esters, such as methyl methacrylate, n-butyl acrylate and t-butyl acrylate. Examples of monomers B.1.2 are unsaturated nitriles, such as acrylonitrile and methacrylonitrile, (meth)acrylic acid C1-C8-alkyl esters, such as methyl methacrylate, n-butyl acrylate and t-butyl acrylate, and derivatives (such as anhydrides and imides) of unsaturated carboxylic acids, such as maleic anhydride and N-phenyl-maleimide or mixtures thereof.<br>
Preferred monomers B.l.l are styrene, a-methylstyrene and/or methyl methacrylate, and preferred monomers B.1.2 are acrylonitrile, maleic anhydride and/or methyl methacrylate.<br>
Particularly preferred monomers are B.l.l styrene and B.1.2 acrylonitrile.<br>
Rubbers B.2 which are suitable for the rubber-modified graft polymers B are, for example, diene rubbers, EP(D)M rubbers, that is to say those based on ethylene/propylene and optionally diene, and acrylate, polyurethane, silicone, chloroprene and ethylene/vinyl acetate rubbers.<br>
Preferred rubbers B.2 are diene rubbers (e.g. based on butadiene, isoprene etc.) or mixtures of diene rubbers or copolymers of diene rubbers or mixtures thereof with<br><br>
Le A 33 285<br>
further copolymerizable monomers (e.g. according to B.1.1 and B.1.2), with the proviso that the glass transition temperature of component B.2. is below 10°C, preferably below -10°C. Pure polybutadiene rubber is particularly preferred.<br>
If necessary and if the rubber properties of component B.2 are not thereby impaired, component B can additionally also comprise small amounts, usually less than 5 wt.%, preferably less than 2 wt.%, based on B.2, of ethylenically unsaturated monomers which have a crosslinking effect. Examples of such monomers having a crosslinking effect are alkylene diol di-(meth)acrylates, polyester di-(meth)acrylates, divinylbenzene, trivinylbenzene, triallyl cyanurate, allyl (meth)acrylate, diallyl maleate and diallyl fumarate.<br>
The rubber-modified graft polymer B is obtained by grafting polymerization of 50 to 99, preferably 65 to 98, particularly preferably 75 to 95 parts by wt. of a mixture of 50 to 99, preferably 60 to 95 parts by wt. monomers according to B.1.1 and 1 to 50, preferably 5 to 40 parts by wt. monomers according to B.1.2 in the presence of 1 to 50, preferably 2 to 35, particularly preferably 5 to 25 parts by wt. rubber component B.2, the grafting polymerization being carried out by a bulk or solution or bulk-suspension polymerization process.<br>
In the preparation of the rubber-modified graft polymers B, it is essential that rubber component B.2 is in dissolved form before the grafting polymerization in the mixture of monomers B.1.1 and/or B.1.2. Rubber component B.2 therefore must not be so highly crosslinked that a solution in B.1.1 and/or B.1.2 becomes impossible, nor must B.2. already be in the form of discrete particles at the start of the grafting polymerization. The particle morphology and increasing crosslinking of B.2 which are important for the product properties of B develop only in the course of the grafting polymerization (in this context see, for example, Ullmann, Encyclopadie der technischen Chemie , volume 19, p. 284 et seq., 4th edition 1980).<br><br><br>
Le A 33 285<br>
A part of the random copolymer of B. 1.1 and B. 1.2 is usually present in polymer B grafted on or into rubber B.2, this graft copolymer forming discrete particles in polymer B. The content in the total copolymer of B. 1.1 and B.1,2 of the grafted-on or -in copolymer of B. 1.1 and B.1.2 - that is to say the grafting yield (= weight ratio between the grafting monomer actually grafted and the total grafting monomers used x 100, stated in %) - should here be 2 to 40%, preferably 3 to 30%, particularly preferably 4 to 20%.<br>
The average particle diameter of the resulting grafted rubber particles (determined by counting on electron microscopy photographs) is in the range from 0.5 to 5 μm, preferably 0.8 to 2.5 μm.<br>
In addition to the graft polymers prepared by bulk polymerization, the moulding compositions according to the invention can also comprise graft polymer prepared by emulsion polymerization. The description of the graft polymers preferably corresponds to that of those prepared by bulk polymerization, but they are prepared by means of emulsion polymerization.<br>
The average particle diameter (d50 value) of the graft base in the emulsion graft polymer is in general 0.05 to 5 μm, preferably 0.10 to 0.5 μm, particularly preferably 0.20 to 0.40 μm. The gel content of the graft base is at least 30 wt.%, preferably at least 40 wt.%.<br>
The ABS graft polymer is particularly preferably an "emulsion graft polymer".<br>
The weight ratio of graft polymer according to component B of the present invention prepared by means of bulk polymerization to graft polymer prepared by means of emulsion polymerization is 100:0 to 50:50, preferably 80:20 to 60:40.<br><br><br>
LeA 33 285<br>
Component C<br>
Component C comprises one or more thermoplastic vinyl (co)polymers C.l and/or polyalkylene terephthalates C.2.<br>
Suitable vinyl (co)polymers C.l are polymers of at least one monomer from the group consisting of vinylaromatics, vinyl cyanides (unsaturated nitriles), (meth)acrylic acid (C1-C8)-alkyl esters, unsaturated carboxylic acids and derivatives (such as anhydrides and imides) of unsaturated carboxylic acids. Particularly suitable (co)polymers are those of<br>
