				<td>The present invention relates to an integrated sample conditioning and air conditioning machine. The machine and the methods disclosed herein are applicable, in general/ to the field of material property testing, more specifically to the area of environmental conditioning of material samples or of laboratory space and instrument test zones wherein testing takes place, and most specifically, for the preferred embodiment, rapid environmental conditioning of cotton fiber, yarn, or fabric samples and the laboratories or test zones of instruments in which they are tested. The present application is.divided out of Indian Patent application No. 568/CAL/97 (hereinafter referred to as the "parent application").<br>
It is well known that the conditions or state of samples undergoing material property testing strongly affect test results. Rigorous and reproducible sample preparation are critical to obtaining precise and accurate test results. Major factors in sample preparation are the precision and accuracies of environmental conditions in which these steps take place. It is also well known that environmental conditions in the testing zones of materials property testing laboratories or instruments can strongly affect test results. This fact is generally important for fiber testing, and particularly critical for cotton, and other natural fibers, and for rayon, and other man-made fibers. Methods and apparatus for controlling testing zone environmental conditions are described in several U.S. Patents and in other published literature, briefly discussed below.<br>
-2 -<br><br>
The prior  disclosures are based  in part on a recognition that   it  is   environmental   conditions  within  testing   zones   that must be accurately,   precisely,   cost-effectively,   or optimally controlled,   rather   than  environmental   conditions   in   the testing  laboratory.      Embodiments  are  disclosed  which  enable realization of<br><br><br>
improved environmental conditions within the testing zones. Thus, Shofner-U.S. Pat. Mo. 4,631,781, Leifeld et al U.S. Pat-- No. 5,121,522,- and Shofner et al U.S. Pat.

Pending Shofner et al U.S. patent application Ser. No; 08/550,710, filed October 31, 1995, International Application No. PCT/US 95/13796 published 17 May 1996 as International Publication Uo.

The subject invention is primarily disclosed in the context of improvements in environmental control methods and apparatus for fiber testing, which are representative of materials testing in general. Accordingly provided next below is brief background information relating to "rapid conditioning," a sample preparation step for instrument classification of cotton , for HVI testing.  Facilitating and improving this sample preparation step is an objective of the subject invention. Commercial embodiments of such rapid conditioning apparatus may ba called "RapidCon."  Another objective of the invention is to advantageously combine sample conditioning with laboratory space and instrument test zone environmental conditioning.  Commercial embodiments of such multiple purpose apparatus which provides air conditioning of external laboratory space and rapid conditioning of internal test samples may be called "KapidAir."<br>
- L -<br><br>
Various United States Department of Agriculture papers describe a major improvement in fiber-testing methods, known as "rapid conditioning," wherein- sample * condition times are reduced from 72 or 4 8 hours to 15 minutes or' less.  Examples are J.L. Knowlton and Roger K. Alldredge, "Experience with Hapid Conditioning of IIVI Samples," Beltwide Cotton Conference, San Diego, California, January 1994; and Darryl W. Earnest, "Advancements in USDA Cotton Classing Facilities,11 Engineered Fiber Conference, Raleigh, North Carolina, Hay 1996.<br>
. Before this "rapid conditioning," for more, than seventy-five years, certain fiber, yarn, or fabric tests have been conducted under so-called "Standard laboratory Environment" or ASTM conditions of 65% relative humidity and 70°F (21°C) dry bulb temperature.  since what matters most:, for good test results, is not conditions in the lab but conditions in the samples {and within the testing zones) at the time of testing, the various ASTM methods for fiber, yarn, or fabric samples further include the requirement that the samples to be tasted be stored or "conditioned" in the standard environment for 72 hours prior to testing in the standard environment.  This storage time presumably allows'the samples to "reach equilibrium." It is noted that samples so conditioned are passively equilibrating, and that equilibrium usually refers to sample moisture content.  Moisture content is the weight of water in the sample as a percentage of the dry weight of the sample-  For cotton, equilibrium moisture content MC is about 7.3% at 65% RH, 70°F (21°C).  .<br>
It should however be noted that moisture content is only one fiber, yarn, or fabric material property measurement whose equilibrium value is of interest.  Others ' include tenacity and length (for fibers), and such material properties are much more important for selling, buying and using the fibers than is moisture content*  We emphatically note that moisture content affects other fiber material properties, and is therefore an important control variable.<br>
". 5 .<br><br>
but is not as important for marketing or utilization purposes.<br>
Whereas equilibration times of 72 hours yield the best and most consistent test results, such periods are unacceptably long in today's intensely competitive and information-hungry marketplace. It is therefore critically important that the tests be executed accurately and precisely, that is, with minimal bias or random errors. But testing before equilibria in the tested properties are reached can disastrously (in profit/loss terms) reduce accuracy and precision, as equilibrium times are different for different materials test parameters.<br>
Recognizing the severe conflict between promptly available versus good {precise and accurate) results, the United States Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Marketing Service, Cotton Division, began investigations in the early 1990's into actively and rapidly conditioning cotton samples. These investigations were remarkably successful and proved that well-conditioned laboratory air could be actively drawn through HVI samples (as opposed to passive or diffusional mass and heat transfer), which active conditioning or "rapid conditioning" enabled samples to reach moisture content-or strength equilibrium in less than about 15 minutes. The Knowlton et al and Earnest literature references cited above provide a description. "Rapid conditioning" is now employed in most of the fourteen USDA/AMS cotton classing offices.<br>
-6-<br><br>
In effort to extend USDA results to small instrument classing operations having one to four HVI's (versus twenty to forty)-, and not having well-conditioned laboratories, 'it"has" been discovered that simply drawing 65%, 70°F (21qC) air through the samples for 15 minutes yielded unacceptable test results for dry and wet samples, and that unacceptably long conditioning times were required to achieve good results. It has been also found that sample type and size affected test results and conditioning times. Still further, it has been found that' samples having a moisture content near 7.3% did not require much, if any, rapid conditioning. Further, small laboratories could not afford expensive laboratory or test zone environmental controls.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Accordingly, it is an object of the invention to provide for complex, sample-specific conditioning cycles which optimize test results and minimize active conditioning times.<br>
The primary object of the invention is to combine, in one cost-effective machine, internal sample conditioning and external air conditioning capability for laboratory space and instrument test zones.<br>

Within the environmental conditioning zone a gas flow is deliberately applied to the materials, the gas flow being conditioned by one or more parameters which control the material properties, and with, the application cycle for each of the one or more controlling parameters having been previously determined. The materials are tested in one or more subsequent machine steps.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
FIGS. 1 and 2 are front and right side views of a sample conditioning machine 10 having three identical, vertically-organized stages 12 upon which sit perforated bottom sample trays 14.  For High Volume Instrument (HVI) cotton classing samples, the sample trays 14 are preferably 32 x 32 x 6 inches (81 ix. 81 x 15 cm) , constructed of light-weight yet strong cardboard or plastic, and have about 25% or more of their bottom areas perforated with, holes (not shown) .  The holes restrain or hold the samples, while permitting relatively unrestricted air flows.  X preferred tray bottom consists of 1/16 inch (1.6 mm) thick perforated aluminum having 1/8 inch (3.2 ma) holes with 3/16 inch 
A 'stick-man operator 16 in FIG. 2 suggests general size and proportions of a machine 19 having a height of 72 inches (183 cm) and a depth of 34 inches (86 cm) .  Width seen in FIG. 1 is about 54 inches (1-37 cm) . FIG. 2 also suggests how the operator 16 loads sample trays 14 into sample conditioning machine io from sample preparation space 18. tJpon loading trays 14, operator 16 selects the appropriate conditioning cycle with switch 23 and then presses start switch 22, whereupon machine 10 initiates and automatically executes a sample conditioning cycle.  The manner in which sample specific conditioning cycles are chosen, either manually or automatically, is described more fully hereinbelow.  The apparatus and<br>
15<br><br>
methods enabling such cycles are one aspect of the invention.<br>
Upon completion of the sample conditioning cycle, annunciator light bar 25 flashes*  The operator 16 then pushes sample trays 14 onto a rack 24., which sits in testing laboratory space 20,  The next batch of sample traya 14 may then be loaded, whereupon the operator £6 again selects the appropriate, sample conditioning cycle with switch 23 and presses start switch 22 to initiate that cycle.<br>
FIGS. 3 and 4 show a horizontally-organized sample conditioning machine 30, also having three processing stages 34, 35, 36 for sample trays 14.' Gas flow conditions may be different or the same for the stages 34, 35, 36.  Conditioning cycle selection procedures and sample conditioning processing rates are identical for machine 10 of FIGS. 1 and 2 and machine. 30 of FIGS. 3 and 4"<br>
Machine configuration 10 of FIGS. 1 and 2, and machine configuration 30 of FIGS. 3 and 4, serve to condition material samples according to sample-specific conditioning cycles, details of which are described hereinbelow with reference to FIG. 7,<br>
With reference to FIGS- 5 and 6, an additional function is served by an integrated sample conditioning and air conditioning machine 40.  Sample preparation space 18 and testing laboratory space 20 are typically divided by wall 26.  It is usually not essential that sample preparation space 18 be well-conditioned.  Testing laboratory space 20 must be well-conditioned, with standard environmental conditions, as described in the prior art background.  Rigidly controlled testing laboratory 20 conditions, coupled with rigidly-controlled internal test zone conditions .46, are advantageous in terms of costs and performance, and this is enabled iy the integrated maciiine 40 of the invention.  Test zone environmental control using movable condition-ing apparatus is described in the above-incorporated Shofner et al Pat. No. 5,537,868.  The apparatus of the invention can provide the conditioned gas<br>
_ 16 .<br><br>
flows for such test- zone 4 6 environmental controls and for testing laboratory space 20.<br>
Xn FIG. 6, conditioned sample tray 14 delivery 41 is into laboratory space 20, which space 20 is conditioned entirely or partly by air distributed from supply ductwork 42.  Conditioned gas flows 220 in duct 42 are provided by machine 40, as are conditioned flows 43 in duct. 44 for internal environmental controls In one or more test zones 46 in testing instrument 48.  Testing Instrument 48 may test fibers, yarn, fabric, or other materials.  For fiber testing, to which this preferred embodiment is directedr testing instrument 48 may be High Volume Instrument (HVT}# an Advanced Fiber Information System (&amp;FXS) , or a EapidTester as disclosed in Shofner et. al U.S. Patent Application Serial Nos. 08/944,912 and 08/944,9X3, filed October 6, 1997.  KVX instruments are manufactured by Zellweger Uster Inc., Knoxvllle, Tennessee, U.S.A.,; and by Premier Polytronics Limited, Colmbatore, India.  AFIS is manufactured by Zellweger Uster Inc. BapidtPester Is manufactured by Premier Polytronics Limited.<br>
A sub-space 20A of testing laboratory space 20, termed herein an "oasis zone11 2QA, is of particular practical Importance; the accuracy and precision of environmental conditions In this sub-space 20A may be much, more rigidly and cost-effectively controlled. Outside oasis zone 20A, conditions may be relaxed.  Once conditioned internally by sample conditioning machine 4 0 r -the samples remain in rigidly-controlled environments of ¦the oasis zone 20A or test zone(3) 46 until testing Is finished.  "Oasis 2onesM 20A are particularly cost-effectively enabled by the subject invention-Conditioned gas flows supplied to lab space 20 (including the oasis zone 20&amp;) and test zone 4 6 by, typically, well-insulated ducts 42, 44 r are returned 204 to sample conditioning and air conditioning machine 4 0 through return air grill (s) 43.  Well known but unshown air conditioning elements such as filters, dampers, and the like are used as necessary.  In some cases, return air<br>
17<br><br>
ducts are advantageous.  supply ducts 42, 44 and various grills 45, turning vanes 47, seals 49, and other such air supply and air return components chosen to meet particular sample-specific air conditioning requirements, are well known in the art.<br>
There are two interrelated aspects of the invention, Sample-Specific Conditioning Cycles, and Combined Sample Conditioning and Zone Air Conditioning, which are described next'below.<br>
Sample^Sx&gt;ecii? 1c Conditioning Cyclegt The investigations into the various equilibrium processes associated with material sample conditioning and subsequent testing have revealed conditioning times and test result qualities that are dependent on sample size, sample type, beginning sample state, ending sample statef sensitivity of measured material property to environmental conditions, and the like.  Using a cotton fiber example, small samples of Acala varieties which begin conditioning at 6% moisture content require far less conditioning time othan large samples of Pima varieties beginning at 3% moisture content.  For cotton marketing purposes, HVI strength (i.e. tenacity) and length affect buy-sell-utilization decisions more strongly.  Whereas realizing equilibrium moisture content is important, we have found that it is far more important for the sample-conditioning functions of the. invention to achieve higher precision and accuracy in strength and length measurements, and with shorter conditioning times-<br>
FIG. 1 discloses an embodiment of sample-specific conditioning apparatus, applicable to either tha machine 10 of FIGS. 1 and 2, or to the machine 30 of FIGS. 3 and 4* In FIG. 7f a perforated-bottora sample tray 14, holding perhaps twenty-four cotton classing samples, each weighing about 0.25 to 0o75 pounds {0 = 113 to 0 = 340 kg), sits within. ©ample environmental conditioning chamber 50
'1'8<br><br>
front and back by unshown doors, or in preferable practice, the fronts and backs of sample trays 14, which can be arranged for adequate sealing to minltoize'unwanted air flow losses or entries-  Accordingly, it will be appreciated that each of the conditioning stages 12 in FIGS. 1 and 2 and in FIGS. 3 and 4 is in fact an essentially isolated environmental chamber wherein conditioning air flows enter 53 and leave 55 via entrance conduit 57 and exit conduit 59, respectively.  Entering 53 and leaving 55 air flow parameters are measured by sensors 101, 102 and sample characteristics are measured prior to loading or during processing, or both, by. sample sensors 104.  Air flow parameter sensors 101, 102 include humidity, temperature, static pressure, velocity, and the like and particularly include sensors for the set of parameters listed in the above-incorporated Shofner et al U.S. Fat. Ho. 5,361,450. Sample sensors 104 include sensors for sample weight, moisture content, calorimetric properties, near-infrared reflectance <nxk image analysis and the ii3ca.></nxk>
Sample property sensing is preferably made prior to conditioning (i.e. beginning state) but may also be performed concurrently or subsequently (ending state), to achieve more rigid control. Algorithms in microcontroller 100 can be adjusted to yield "tighter" controls according to adaptive control system methodologies.  As a full extension, each of the plurality of samples may be measured and conditioned independently, when the results justify the increased costs-  In usual practice, each of the' plurality of samples is sufficiently like the others that average measurements are adequate to control average conditions in the entering air flow 53,<br>
Environmental conditions in entering gas flow 53 are controlled by conventional air conditioning elements 60 preferably arranged as seen schematically in FXG. 7.  For twenty-four samples, weighing about 0.5 pound (0.22.7 leg) each, in tray 14 (described above) , volumetric air flow is about 600 ft3/min (17 m3/min) when the pressure difference across the samples is 3.5 inches (8.9 cm) water column-<br>
19<br><br>
Dust, filter 61, atomizer nozzle humidifier 62, fan 64, driven by motor 66, steam nozzle humidifier 68, finned cooling coil(s)- 70, electrical heater element 72, and their respective control elements 63, 67, 69, 71, 73f are sized to condition flows of this magnitude and character for each stage 50,  Three such stages 50 are illustrated in FIGS. 1 and" 2 (vertically organized) and in FIGS. 3 and 4 (horizontally -organized) .<br>
Described next is a procedural example which completes the explanation of a method enabled by apparatus as in FIG. 7.  Those skilled in the art can readily create simpler or more complex cycles therefrom.<br>
Incoming samples are placed in trays 14.  The sample type, net sample weight, beginning moisture and subsequent test(s) desired are measured either manually or automatically, at one or more measuring stations, and entered into microcontroller 100, along with other sample-specific inputs via unshown keypad/display into I/O ports 110,  The operator next presses the start/ stop switch 22 as described above, whose binary input (contact closure) enters at I/O port 112.  Microcontroller 100 then causes the sample-specific conditioning cycle program to execute control of tha system 40 environmental conditioning elements (such as humidifier 68) via I/O ports such as I/O ports 113 and 210.  The result of such complex, sample-specific environmental controls is improved test results for samples in trays 14 within isolated environmental conditioning chamber 50.<br>
FIG. 8 shows the resulting cycle temporal<br>
waveforms 120 for entering air relative humidity (RH) 122, dry bulb temperature (T) 124 &gt; and negative static pressure (suction) (AP) 126, including typical set-point values for intervals Tl and T2, for a dry (e.g., less than 4%) Acala variety.  Thus during interval Tl of 8 minutes, entering air RH is 80% at a temperature of 85°F (29°C) and a suction of 1 inch (2.54 cm) water column.  During interval T2 of 6 minutes, entering air RH is reduced to 65% at a reduced temperature of 70°F (21CC), with increased suction of 3.5<br>
20 -<br><br>
inches (8.89 cm) water column.  The total cycle time TX + T2 is 14 minutes.  It will be noted that, the environmental conditions during interval" T2 are the usual "standard" conditions.<br>
Were these Acala samples to have moisture content: TD£ 6%, t.he cycle automatically selected by microcontroller 100 could omit the Tl portion.  Were the samples to be dry Pima, the Tl portion of the cycle could be doubled in time duration.  Were the samples to be wet Acala (9%), the relative humidity (KH) X12 set point 121 would be a relatively low 50% during the Tl portion of the cycle.<br>
Importantly, and in summary and conclusion of ¦this section, ,,ie-has been found that such sample-specific<br>
conditioning cycles produce superior HVI test: results, the primary objective, and good moisture contents, and are, on average, faster.  Further, yarn samples, fabric samples or material samples in general may be placed on stage 12, in tray 14, within isolated environmental chamber 50 for conditioning in accordance with the method disclosed herein-<br>
Combined Sample Conditioning and Zone. Air Conditioning<br>
Another major objective of the invention is to provide cost-effective environmental conditioning for laboratory space 20, especially for the sub-spac© identified as "oasis-Zone" 20A in FIG. 6 and for one or more test zone environments 46 in one or more testing instruments 48, in economic combination with sample conditioning, all by one machine 40 serving thereby, multiple purposes.<br>
Sample conditioning functions ar® sesn in FXGS" 5S 6 and 7 to be internal to machine 40 within isolated environmental chamber 50.  Whereas environmental . conditioning functions are enabled internally to machine 40 by conditioning apparatus 6 0 and control system apparatus 100, supply air flows are directed externally to laboratory apace' 20, 2QA or instrument test zones 46 by ducts 222 (or, for clarity, ducts 42, 44 in FIG, 6) .  Thusf there is an<br>
Z 1<br><br>
economical combination for.multiple purposes resulting from the isolated environmental chamber 50, and methods are implemented for enabling sample-specific conditioning cycles internally within chamber 50, with simultaneous control of external lab space 20 or sub-space 20A or test zone(s) 46.<br>
The findings in accordance with the invention and developments therefrom, began with recognition that the environmental parameters or conditions associated with sample conditioning could, by proper design and controls, be made compatible with environmental parameters or conditions associated with laboratory space or test zone conditioning. Two practical embodiments are disclosed herein, described with reference to FIGS 7 and 9, respectively.<br>
In the embodiment of FIG.7, the negative pressure (suction) in exit conduit 59 is for example in the range of 0.5 to 5 inches (1.27 to 12.7 cm) water column, and is typically around 1 to 2 inches (2.54 to 5.08  cm)water column. Such suctions are satisfactory for drawing return air 204 from laboratory space 20 into inlet grill 43 (FIG.6), through recited above but unshown filters or dampers, and into return air conduit 200. Damper 206, actuated by driver 208 under the control of microcontroller 100 through one of control signal lines 210, and damper 202 operate in concert to realize desired suctions in return conduit 200 and exit conduit 59. Fan 64, whose motor 65 is powered by a variable frequency inverter, is adjusted in speed to realize desired suction in negative plenum 214 so that dampers 202 and 206 can realize<br>
desired suctions in conduits 59 and 200.<br>
-22-<br><br>
Similarly, positive plenum 216 pressures in the range of 0.2 to 2 inches {0.508 to 5.08 cm) water column were designed. "Fine-tuning" adjustments by dampers 218, 219 enable satisfactory pressures for sample conditioning entering air 53 and for supply air 220 moving in duct 222. Supply air flow 220 in supply duct 222 may be split into two or more flow components moving in laboratory<br>
-23-<br><br>
space supply duct 42 and instrument test zone supply duct: 44 (FIC.6).  Representative volumetric supply.flow rates are 2500 ft?/win (70 is3/min) in duct 42 and 500 feet ft3/min {14 m3/min) in duct 44.<br>
The?, environmental parameters or conditiona of gas flows supplied by ducts 42 and 44 stay be egual to each other and to entering air flow 55 conditions, and such equality is achieved bysimply splitting the air flowing from positive plenum 216 into three flows by use of dampens as described above; 600 ft3/min (X7 m3/min) for sample entry 53 in conduit 57, 500 ft3/rain (14 m3/min) in ducrfc 44, and 2500 ft3/min (70 m3/min) in duct 42,  whereas such flow splitting is straightforward and results in equality of environmental conditions in each of the respective flow components, and is useful in many installations, each air flow component may be further conditioned, after splitting, to achieve desired, different environmental,parameters in said component.  "To clarify and illustrate, RH in plenum 216 could be 80%, enabling 65% set points to be achieved in laboratory space 20 and test zone 46* Electrical resistance reheater 23 0 under the control of sensors 101 and microcontroller 100 could elevate the temperature and thereby the RH of entering air to 65%. These approaches to realizing different environmental conditions for the multiple flows having multiple purposes may be extended for all environmental parameters by appropriate use of additional control elements 60 under control of microcontroller 100.<br>
Finally, FIGv 9 discloses another practical embodiment f with somewhat different air flow paths compared to the embodiment of FIG. 7. , In FIG. 7, sample inlet air flow 53 is derived from the positive plenum which also . provides external conditioning air flow*  In FIG. Bf sample inlet air flow 353 is derived from the return air flow 2 04, which return air flow 204 is the same in FIGS. 6, 7 and B.<br>
In FIG. 9, dampers 306 and 202 realize proper suction and flows, as before-.  Humidifier 362 and such other air conditioning elements as desired condition the<br>
:24-<br><br>
sample inlet air flow 353, as before. All conditioning elements, such as conditioning apparatus 60 and the various dampers, are controlled by microcontroller 100, as before.<br>
The configuration example of FIG. 9 is typical for apparatus intended to call "RapidAir".<br>
In conclusion, whereas it may appear to be complicated, cumbersome, and restrictive to attempt this combination of elements for multiple conditioning purposes, it has been found that the combination can achieve superior HVI test results, particularly regarding the important "oasis-zone" 20A impact, and the laboratory space 20 air conditioning costs can be half these associated with a separate laboratory space 20 air conditioner. To reiterate, the findings began with recognition that the environmental parameters for the various purposes were reasonably compatible at the outset of our developments.<br>
While specific embodiments of the invention have been illustrated and described herein, it is realized that numerous modifications and changes will occur to those skilled in the art. It is therefore to be understood that the appended claims are intended to cover all such modifications and changes as fall within the true spirit and scope of the invention.<br>
