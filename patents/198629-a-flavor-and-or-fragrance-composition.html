The present invention relates to a flavor and/or fragrance composition for the enhancement of diffiisivity and long-lasting property of flavor and/or fragrance, a fragrance composition having an excellent difftisivity and long-lasting property and a cosmetic, toiletry, bath composition, food and drink and pharmaceutical having an excellent diffiisivity and long-lasting property of fragrance comprising these ingredients.<br>
BACKGROUND ART In order to prepare an excellent fragrance composition by blending aroma materials or blend such a fragrance composition with various products, various fixatives have been hitherto used for the purpose of allowing the fragrance composition and various products to keep diffusivity of desired fragrance and adjusting the fragrance properties and long-lasting property of aroma materials.  Known fixatives include various compounds such as dipropylene glycol, triethyl citrate, benzyl benzoate, benzyl salicylate and diethyl phthalate.  These compounds have heretofore been incorporated in fragrance compositions<br><br>
or various products. However, mere use of these fixatives is not sufficient for the adjustment of volatility and long-lasting property of aroma components and fragrance con^ositions. Some of these fixatives have safety problem. Thus, studies have been made to obtain fixatives having an excellent diffusivity and long-lasting property of fragrance and causing no safety problem. As fixatives having these properties there have recently been proposed p-mentheme-3,8-diol (Japanese Patent Ho. 3,045,562), i-hydroxymethyl-cycloallcanol derivative <jp-a-5-295388 and specific biphenyl compounds term as used herein means an published japanese patent application></jp-a-5-295388>
While these references of prior art have reference to the results of long-lasting property test on fragrance compositions made organoleptically on blotter, there is no reference to the fixing effect in products (e.g., cosmetic, toiletry, bath composition, food and drink, pharmaceutical) provided with a fragrance coinposition containing the foregoing compound as a fixative.  It has thus been desired to develop and provide a novel fixative for the purpose of further improving fixing effects in fragrance compositions, expanding the variation of fixatives with respect to fragrance con^ositions or further enhancing diffusivity and long-lasting property of fragrance in products comprising various fragrance compositions incorporated therein.<br><br>
An object of the invention is to provide a method which can provide improved diffuaivity and long-lasting property of fragrance as con^ared with a method using conventional known fixatives and which enhance diffusivity '  and long'lasting property of fragrance without causing any safety problem, an agent for the enhancement of diffusivity and long-lasting property of fragrance of an aroma component and/or fragrance composition to be used in the method, a fragrance composition having an excellent diffusivity and long-lasting property of fragrance comprising the agent incorporated therein, and products such as cosmetic, toiletry, bath composition, food and drink and pharmaceutical having an excellent diffusivity and long-lasting property of fragrance comprising these ingredients.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The inventors made extensive studies of solution to the foregoing problems with the prior art. As a result, it was found that the incorporation of a compound represented by the following general formula (1) in a fragrance composition, the incorporation of a fragrance con^osition containing the compound of the general formula (1) in various products, or the incorporation of the compound of the general formula (1) together with a fragrance composition in various products during the preparation of these products makes it possible to obtain a fragrance<br><br>
1-composition having a remarkably enhanced diffusivity and long-lasting property of fragrance or various products having an excellent diffusivity and long-lasting property of fragrance. It was also found that products thus prepared have no safety problems. The present invention has thus been worked out.<br>
Accordingly   the   present   invention   provides   a   flavor   and/or   fragrance composition which comprises:<br>
(i) at least one compound selected from the group consisting of compound represented by the general formula (1) and compound represented by the general formula (2)<br><br>
wherein A represents H or an OH group; B represents H or a methyl group; and n represents an integer of from 0 to 2, and<br>
(ii)      an aroma or a fragrance component, which has at least one note selected from the group consisting of floral, citrus, fruity, green, mint, herb and ■ marine.<br><br>
wherein the quantity ratio of the compound (i) and the compound (ii) is from 0.01 : 99.1 to 10:90by weight based on the total composition.<br>
