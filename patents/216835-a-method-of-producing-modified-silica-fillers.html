				<td>A METHOD OF PRODUCING MODIFIED SILICA FILLERS<br>
[0001] This invention relates to a method of producing modified silica fillers in which<br>
silica is contacted with a blend or mixture of (i) an alkyl and aryl group containing<br>
dichlorosilanes and (ii) a trialkoxysilane free of hydrocarbon or organofunctional groups<br>
reactive with a silica surface, in a weight ratio of 1:0.1 to 1:2 respectively. In an alternate<br>
embodiment, modified silica fillers can be made by contacting silica with only the alkyl<br>
and aryl group containing dichlorosilane.<br>
[0002] This is an improvement in methods of modifying silica fillers, as described in for<br>
example, US Patent 6384125 (May 7,2002), which is assigned to the same assignee as the<br>
present invention. While the 125 patent refers generally to the use of some similar<br>
organometallic compounds and mixtures thereof as the present invention, and their use as<br>
hydrophobing agents for silica, it does not describe any particular mixture or blend of<br>
organosilicon compounds as being any more effective than any other blend, nor does the 125<br>
patent identify the existence of any particular ratio of organosilicon compounds as being<br>
necessary to achieve a new and unexpected results, i.e., an ability to deposit more siloxane on<br>
silica, vis a viz, improved hydrophobicity. In addition; the 125 patent fails to teach using<br>
only single organosilicon compounds of the type of alkyl and aryl group containing<br>
dichlorosilanes, as the 125 patent requires as a second component, what it refers to as a<br>
functionalizing coupling agent.<br>
[0003] The invention is directed to a method of making modified silica fillers in which<br>
silica is contacted with a blend or mixture of organosilicon compounds. In particular, it is<br>
directed to an improvement in treating silica with blends or mixtures of (i) an alkyl and aryl<br>
group containing dichlorosilane and (ii) a trialkoxysilane free of hydrocarbon or<br>
organofunctional groups reactive with a silica surface, in weight ratios of 1:0.1 to 1:2,<br>
respectively. Preferably, the weight ratio is 1:0.3 to 1:1, and most preferably the weight ratio<br>
is 1:0.5. In another embodiment, the treating agent for silica may consist of only (i) the alkyl<br>
and aryl group containing dichlorosilane.<br>
[0004] In particular, the invention is directed to a method of making modified silica fillers<br>
in which silica surfaces are contacted with compositions containing organosilicon<br>
compounds. The improvement consists of treating silica surfaces with compositions in which<br>
the organosilicon compounds in the compositions are only of types of structural groups of<br>
monomelic dichlorosilanes and trialkoxysilanes. The compositions may be (i) mixtures or<br>
blends of alkyl and aryl group containing dichlorosilanes and trialkoxysilanes free of<br>
hydrocarbon or organofunctional groups reactive with silica surfaces, (H) mixtures or blends<br>
of substituted alkyl and substituted aryl group containing dichlorosilanes in which the<br>
dichlorosilanes are free of hydrocarbon or organofunctional groups reactive with silica<br>
surfaces and trialkoxysilanes free of hydrocarbon or organofunctional groups reactive with<br>
silica surfaces, or (iii) substituted and unsubstituted alkyl and aryl group containing<br>
dichlorosilanes in which the dichlorosilanes are free of hydrocarbon or organofunctional<br>
groups reactive with silica surfaces. The mixtures and blends contain dichlorosilanes and<br>
trialkoxysilanes in a weight ratio of 1:0.1 to 1:2, respectively.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a method of producing modified silica<br>
fillers in which the silica surfaces are contacted with compositions containing<br>
organosilicon compounds, the improvement comprising treating silica surfaces with<br>
compositions in which the organosilicon compounds in the compositions are only of<br>
types of structural groups of monomeric dichlorosilanes and trialkoxysilanes comprising<br>
(i) mixture or blends of alkyl and aryl group containing dichlorosilanes and<br>
trialkoxysilanes, and (ii) mixture or blends of substituted alkyl and substituted aryl group<br>
containing dichlorosilanes in which the dichlorosilanes are free of hydrocarbon or<br>
organofunctional groups reactive with silica surfaces and trialkoxysilanes, wherein the<br>
mixtures and blends containing the dichlorosilanes and trialkoxysilanes are in a weight<br>
ratio of 1:0.1 to 1:2, respectively.<br>
[0005] These and other features of the invention will become apparent from a consideration<br>
of the detailed description.<br>
DESCRIPTION<br>
[0006] The silica used to make the modified silica fillers according to this invention are the<br>
colloidal or precipitated silicas of the type used to formulate polymeric compositions such as<br>
rubber, particularly those rubber compositions used in the manufacture of vehicle tires for<br>
improving the mechanical properties of tire rubber. Such silicas are described in much detail<br>
in the 125 patent to which reference may be had, and which is considered as being<br>
incorporated herein by reference thereto.<br>
[0007] Mineral fillers such as silica, having a small particle size and a large surface area,<br>
are capable of increasing the tensile strength of rubber compounds, and therefore are useful<br>
as reinforcing materials for rubber; particularly when the mineral surfaces of the filler are<br>
converted to hydrophobic low energy surfaces.<br>
[0008] Silica treating agents according to the invention are mixtures and blends of alkyl and<br>
aryl group containing dichlorosilanes, and trialkoxysilanes, both of which are preferably free<br>
of hydrocarbon or organofunctional groups reactive with silica surfaces. Thus, the<br>
organosilicon compounds useful according to the invention may contain alkyl groups,<br>
cycloalkyl groups, araalkyl (arylalkyl) groups, alkaryl (alkylaryl) groups, aryi groups, and<br>
certain substituted groups which are not reactive with respect to silica surfaces.<br>
[0009] Some examples of alkyl groups are methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, hexyl, octyl, decyl,<br>
dodecyl, octadecyl, and nonadecyl. Some examples of cycloalkyl groups are cyclobutyl and<br>
cyclohexyl. Some examples of araalkyl (arylalkyl) groups are benzyl, phenylethyl, and<br>
2-phenylpropyl. Some examples of alkaryl (alkylaryl) groups are tolyl and mesityl. Some<br>
examples of aryl groups are phenyl, xenyl, naphthyl, and anthracyl. Some examples of<br>
substituted groups which are not reactive with respect to silica surfaces are halogenated alkyl<br>
groups and aryl groups such as chloromethyl, dichloromethyl, trichloromethyl,<br>
3-chloropropyl, chlorocyclohexyl, chlorophenyl, and dichloroxenyl; alkyl groups containing<br>
alkoxy radicals such as methoxy, ethoxy, butoxy, and pentoxy; alkyl groups containing<br>
sulfido (-S-), disulfido, or polysulfido radicals; and alkyl groups containing cyano (-C=N)<br>
radicals.<br>
[0010] Representative of some suitable alkyl and aryl group containing dichlorosilanes are<br>
t-butylphenyldichlorosilane, chlorophenylmethyldichlorosilane, phenylethyldichlorosilane,<br>
phenylmethyldichlorosilane (methylphenyldichlorosilane) (MPDCS), and<br>
p-tolylmethyldichlorosilane.<br>
[0011] Representative of some suitable trialkoxysilanes are benzyltriethoxysilane,<br>
2-chloroethyltriethoxysilane, (p-chloromethyl)phenyltrimethoxysilane,<br>
(p-chloromethy^phenyltri-n-propoxysilane, chloromethyltriethoxysilane,<br>

3-mercaptopropyltrimethoxysilane, methyltriethoxysilane, methyltrimethoxy silane,<br>
pentyltriethoxysilane, phenethyltrimethoxysilane, phenyltriethoxysilane,<br>
phenyltrimethoxysilane, n-propyltriethoxysilane, n-propyltrimethoxysilane, and<br>
p-tolyltrimethoxysilane.<br>
[0012] A general method of making modified silica fillers according to the invention is<br>
described below in Example A, although the modified silica fillers can be made by any<br>
known and accepted technique, for example, as described in detail in the "125 patent, in US<br>
Patent 5908660 (June 1, 1999), and in US Patent 6051672 (April 18, 2000). While these<br>
patents describe general methods, they fail to describe the features of this invention, i.e., the<br>
use of a particular mixture or blend of organosilicon compound(s) in a particular ratio.<br>
[0013] When used in rubber compositions for manufacturing vehicle tires, other<br>
conventional additives may be used along with the modified silica filler, including other<br>
fillers such as carbon black, various oils, plasticizers, accelerators, antioxidants, heat<br>
stabilizers, light stabilizers, zone stabilizers, extenders, and coloring pigments.<br>
[0014] The following examples are set forth in order to illustrate the invention in more<br>
detail. The silica slurry used in the examples contained 6.5 percent by weight of silica, and is<br>
 commercial product of PPG Industries, Inc., Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Neutralization was<br>
carried out by using a standard solution containing 25 percent by weight of sodium<br>
hydroxide, and it was prepared by dissolving 1000 grams of sodium hydroxide pellets in<br>
3000 millilitre of deionized water.<br>
[0015] The apparatus used in treating the silica consisted of a 5-liter round-bottom reaction<br>
lask, with ball joints, a Teflon® shaft stirring paddle assembly, an overhead electrical<br>
stirring motor, and a Type-K thermocouple temperature controller with a flexible heating<br>
nantle. The reaction flask was surmounted with a Dean-Stark trap and water cooler<br>
condenser with a port for a sealed glass thermocouple well directly submersed into the<br>
reaction flask. The third neck of the reaction flask was sealed with a ball-joint cap or an<br>
addition funnel. Filtration and washing of treated silica fillers and silica filler cakes was<br>
onducted with a 253 mm Coors Porcelain Buchner funnel containing Whatman filter paper.<br>
The funnel was mounted on a 4-liter filter flask. A Fisher brand Digital Conductivity Meter<br>
was used to measure the conductivity of the filtrate from the washing process. A Mettler<br>
oledo Portable pH\Ion Meter, Model No. MP 125 was used to measure pH.<br>
[0016] The following procedure, used in Example 2, represents the general procedure<br>
which was repeated in the other Examples 1 and 3-10. Data for each of the Examples 1-10 is<br>
shown in Table 1.<br>
[0017] The reaction flask was charged with 2000 g of silica slurry and 165 g of<br>
concentrated sulphuric acid. The slurry was heated to a temperature of 70 °C and the heat was<br>
then turned off. At this point, a mixture containing 9.10 g of 3-mercaptopropyltriethoxysilane<br>
and 25.5 g of methylphenydichlorosilane was added directly to the reaction flask via a long-<br>
em funnel in rapid fashion over a period of about 2-7 minutes- The treated slurry was then<br>
slowed to stir as it cooled to room temperature over a 60-minute period.<br>
[0018] To the stirred slurry was added 600 mL of a solution containing 25 percent by<br>
weight of sodium hydroxide, in order to adjust the pH in the range of 3.4 to 3.7. The<br>
neutralized slurry was transferred to the Buchner funnel and vacuum filtered to removed the<br>
aqueous phase. The filter cake was then washed repeatedly with copious amounts of water<br>
until the filtrate read less than 100 micro ohms. After allowing it to air-dry overnight, the<br>
filter cake was transferred to plastic pails with lids and spray dried as follows.<br>
[0019] The air-dried treated silica was re-slurried in deionized water to provide a slurry<br>
containing 20-40 percent by weight of the treated silica. The slurry was mixed until all of the<br>
solids were broken up. The slurry was then pumped to a Niro Atomizer spray drier at a rate of<br>
about 20 ml/minute with an inlet temperature of 260 °C and an outlet temperature of between<br>
120-140 °C. The dried and treated silica product was collected and stored in glass jars.<br>
[0020] An elemental analysis of the treated silica was conducted by an independent testing<br>
laboratory. The results of elemental analyses obtained for treated silica fillers prepared in<br>
Examples 1-10 are shown in Table 1.<br>
[0021] In Table 1, the following abbreviations and acronyms are used. MPTES represents<br>
3-mercaptopropyltriethoxysilane HS-CH2CH2CH2-Si(OCH3)3, DMDCS represents<br>
dimethyldichlorosilane (CH3)2SiCl2, MPDCS represents methylphenyldichlorosilane<br>
(CH3)(C6H5)SiCl2, MEDCS represents methylethyldichlorosilane (CH3)(C2H5)SiCl2, and<br>
DPDCS represents diphenyldichlorosilane (C6H5)2SiCl2.<br>
Table 1<br>
[0022] In Table 1, Examples 1,3,4,6,8, and 9 are Comparison Examples. Examples 2, 5,<br>
Comparison Example 1 shows a yield which can be obtained in terms of a percent loss of 27<br>
percent when using dialkyldichlorosilanes having two of the same types of alkyl groups such<br>
as dimethyldichlorosilane, instead of using an alkyl and aryl group containing dichlorosilane.<br>
A comparison between Comparison Example 1 and Example 2 which is according to the<br>
invention and includes using an alkyl and aryl group containing dichlorosilane such as<br>
methylphenyldichlorosilane, shows that significantly improved deposition yields in terms of a<br>
percent loss of only 2 percent, can be obtained by replacing an alkyl group with an aryl<br>
group.<br>
[0023] Comparison Example 3 is similar to Comparison Example 1 in that both examples<br>
use dialkyldichlorosilanes, but in Comparison Example 3 the alkyl groups were not the same,<br>
i.e., methylethyldichorosilane was used instead of dimethyldichlorosilane. In either case,<br>
however, the percent loss was significantly higher than obtained in Example 2 which<br>
represents the invention. By comparing Examples 5 and 7 with Example 2, it can be seen that<br>
the concentration of the alkyl and aryl group containing dichlorosilane in the mixture will<br>
significantly effects the percent loss if it is lowered beyond a certain point.<br>
[0024] Comparison Example 9 shows that when a diaryldichorosilane such as<br>
diphenyldichlorosilane is used, the deposition yield in terms of percent loss is extremely low,<br>
confirming the uniqueness of using an alkyl and aryl group containing dichlorosilane<br>
according to the invention. Example 10 relates to the alternate embodiment of the invention<br>
in which only the alkyl and aryl group containing dichlorosilane, i.e., MPDCS, is used to treat<br>
silica, and it provided equivalent significantly improved deposition yield in terms of a percent<br>
loss of only 12 percent.<br>
[0025] Reference may be had to copending US Patent application Serial No. 10/199,400<br>
filed July 18,2002, entitled "Tetrahalosilane Blends for Treating Silica", and to copending<br>
US Patent application Serial No. 10/199,403, filed July 18, 2002, entitled "Chlorosilane<br>
Blends for Treating Silica", both assigned to the same assignee as the present invention.<br>
However, neither of the assignee"s copending applications are directed to silica treatments of<br>
the nature claimed in the present application.<br>
[0026] Other variations may be made in compounds, compositions, and methods described<br>
herein without departing from the essential features of the invention. The embodiments of the<br>
invention specifically illustrated herein are exemplary only and not intended as limitations on<br>
