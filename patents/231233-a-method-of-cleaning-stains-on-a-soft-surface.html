The following specification particularly describes the nature of this invention and the manner in which<br>
it is to be performed<br><br>
METHOD OF CLEANING<br>
The invention relates to method of treating soft surfaces by the production of a stable foam from a solution of a cleaning formulation and applying the stable foam to the fabric, the invention includes the cleaning formulation itself comprising a source of hydrogen peroxide, such as sodium percarbonate, and at least one surfactant.  The invention includes a device for a preparation of the stable foam.<br>
We have found a new method of removing stains from soft surfaces by the production of a stable foam, which is formed from a cleaning formulation, as described herein. The stable foam can be used for direct treatment of stains on soft surfaces (fabric or carpet) and it is prepared by mixing a solution of a cleaning formulation, preferably in combination with aerating, for, preferably, less than 5, 4, 3, 2 minutes: preferably the foam is formed quickly, in less than 1 minute, between 5 and 50, 10 and 40 seconds from mixing with water.  Preferably the cleaning formulation is a solid, such as a granular, compacted or powder composition, ideally the cleaning formulation is granular or powder, to aid dissolution in water. Preferably warm water is used (greater than 25,<br>
30, 40 or 50°C, ideally less than 80, 70, 60, 50°C) .<br>
We present as a feature of the invention a method of cleaning stains on a soft surface the method comprising mixing (preferably dissolving) a solid, preferably a powder, cleaning formulation in water, the formulation comprising a source of active oxygen and at least one<br><br>
surfactant with water to form a stable foam and applying the foam directly onto the stained soft surface.<br>
A further feature of the invention includes a device for the aeration of aqueous surfactant mixtures comprising a cellular plastic attached to a rigid support surface the opposition face of the rigid support surface being attached to a handle.<br>
A further feature of the invention includes a kit for treating stain on soft surfaces comprising a solid, preferably a powder, stain cleaning composition comprising a source of active oxygen and at least one surfactant and a device for the mixing/ aerating of the cleaning composition to form a stable foam for application onto the stain.<br>
Further optional subsequent steps include one or more of the following;<br>
a)	rubbing the stained soft surface;<br>
b)	cleaning the fabric in a fabric washing machine, with or without the addition of a fabric detergent;<br>
c)	rinsing with water the stable foam formulation from the soft surface.<br>
The time period between applying the stable foam and any of the subsequent steps is at least  10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60 seconds, ideally more than 1, 2, or 3 minutes, advisably the stable foam is not left for more than 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, or 4 minutes.<br><br>
By the use of the term stable we mean that the foam retains at least 80%, 90% or 95% of its volume for 2 minutes after its formation. Ideally the foam is prepared by dissolving 15 grams of solid composition into 100 ml of water at 40°C.<br>
The stable foam may be prepared by any suitable mixing device or aeration device to incorporate air into the cleaning formulation solution.<br>
The  ?????? device offers particular advantages in ensuring that all of the solid composition is dissolved prior to application.  This ???? for preventing fibre or colour damage on the soft surface since undissolved solids found on the fibre can provide for localised ????? due largely to the high concentration of active oxygen. By simply applying the stable foam on the fabric such damage is virtually eliminated as undissolved solid remains at the bottle of the water container<br>
A cleaning solution containing a foaming surfactant is necessary for preparing the stable foam. In addition the inclusion of the cleaning formulation of a source of active oxygen provides for oxygen to be evolved during dissolution further providing a rapid development of the stable foam. In addition to the device, a container is also ideally required where the stable foam is prepared.<br>
As a preferred feature of the invention the stable foam is prepared by the use of cellular plastic. Cellular plastics are those with a density of between 1 and 500 kg/m3 preferably between 20 and 80 kg/m3 and with an<br><br>
average pore diameter of at least 0.1 mm, preferably at least 0.4 mm.  Ideally, the cellular plastic has a porosity of &gt;50%, &gt;60%, &gt;70% or &gt;80%.<br>
The "porosity" according to the embodiment is obtained by measuring with a dry automatic densimeter an apparent volume and a true volume of the cellular pastic material, and calculated in accordance with the following equation.<br>
Porosity %=(apparent volume-true volume)/apparent volumex100<br>
The "average pore diameter" is a value measured in accordance with ASTM (Designation: D4404-84) and is specifically a value determined by the measurement of the diameter of pores in accordance with a mercury penetration process using a mercury porosimeter manufactured by Porous Material, Inc.<br>
Suitable cellular plastics are those readily available for example from Euro foam, Miarka and Menshen and are made by any table water-insoluble plastic such as cellulose, polyurethane, polyester, polyether, or blends thereof.<br>
Preferably the cellular plastic is attached to a handle so that the user does not need to get their hands wet. The device comprising the cellular plastic  is plunged into the cleaning formulation containing solution and pressed several times such that the liquid is aerated<br><br>
to form the stable foam when the formulation is squeezed through the cellular plastic.<br>
The device can be moved up and down pushing it against the bottom of a suitable container, until the cleaning formulation is transformed into the stable foam. The time necessary to create the foam with a suitable cellular plastic is quite low, between 10 and 60 seconds, typically below 2 minutes.   The solution is pumped by each up and down movement through the pores of the cellular plastic to form the stable foam.<br>
The liquid excess can be squeezed out from the cellular plastic component. The cellular plastic can be then dipped into the foam and applied onto the surface to be treated. The device can also be used to rub the surface with the cellular plastic component. During the rubbing action the cleaning foam can more easily penetrate the stain that can in addition be adsorbed by the cellular plastic. To complete the cleaning, a rinsing step might be necessary or eventually in the case of fabric, a normal wash can be done in a fabric washing machine.<br>
Referring to figure 1 the device consists of at least two components, a handle 2 and cellular plastic 1, attached to the handle by a glue or a heat seal.<br>
The handle (1) can be formed for example by one piece or two identical stick parts attached together through a screwing system. Each stick has a diameter from 1 mm to 6 cm, preferably from 3 mm to 12 mm and it may<br><br>
have a cavity running through the centre to reduce weight and material costs. The wall thickness of the handle (1) is from 0.1 mm up to 1 mm, preferably between 0.1 mm to 0.5 mm. The handle length may range from 1 cm up to 25 cm, preferably from 3 cm to 15 cm. The handle can be made of wood, metal or plastic. Preferred is a plastic material and more preferred plastic materials are polyethylene, polypropylene, polystyrene, or PET.<br>
The handle is attached to a support (2) that is a disk with a diameter from 1 cm to 30 cm, preferably from 3 cm to 10 cm. The thickness can range from 0.1 mm up to 12 cm, preferably from 0.5 to 10 mm. The support (2) can be made of wood, metal or plastic. Preferred is plastic material and more preferred are polyethylene, polypropylene, polystyrene, or PET.<br>
The cellular plastic (3) can be any shape but is preferably cylindrical shape. The diameter can range from 1 cm to 20 cm, preferably from 3 cm to 10 cm. The height can range from 0.1 mm up to 50 mm, preferably from 1 to 10 mm. The cellular plastic can be made of synthetic materials as polyurethane, polyester, polyether, or a blend thereof or natural cellulose.<br>
The support (2) can be attached to the handle (1) by heat sealing, with a glue or with any screw system type. The cellular plastic(3) is attached to the support (2) by heat sealing or with a glue.<br>
Preferably the cleaning formulation contains oleoyl sarcosinate (preferably as a sodium salt), a source of<br><br>
active oxygen, such as sodium percarbonate, and preferably at least one other surfactant.<br>
We have found better performance is observed with the use of oleoyl sarcosinate, especially where the composition is applied directly onto the stain. The above surfactant types can be used in combination with other surfactants, such as alcohol ethoxylates and alkyl sulphates. A combination of alkyl naphthalene sulfonates and oleoyl sarcosinates provide improved stain removal efficacy for laundry detergent products. The alkyl naphthalene sulfonates and oleoyl sarcosinate surfactant combination of the present invention can be also used in combination with a source of active oxygen, such as sodium percarbonate, and bleach activators, such as TAED. Other ingredients that can be used include polymers, chelating agents, fillers, solvents, enzymes, fragrances and other minor components such as preservatives, dyes, thickeners and antifoaming agents.<br><br>

RESULTS:<br>
The device has been compared with other foam making equipment in terms of time for foam preparation, foam consistency and convenience. The gadget efficacy in foam application onto the stain and cleaning performance have been showed against no gadget usage.<br>
FOAM PREPARATION:<br>
The foam has been prepared by dissolving in warm water Oxi Action Max powder, which contains foaming surfactants. About 15 grams of powder has been used with 100 ml of warm water. The solution can be prepared in a<br><br>
300-500 ml open container.<br>
The different devices are compared for preparing the foam. The reference is the spoon that can be used as mixing/aerating device.<br>
The devices are rated in terms of timing necessary to prepare the foam, consistency of the foam, convenience in preparing the foam and cost:<br><br>
The lower the time in making the cream the better, provided a high convenience in preparing it, high convenience rating. The consistency rating is the better, the closer to 3. Convenience in using the gadget and cream consistency have been assigned to the different gadgets through a panel test with 16 panellists.<br><br>
STAIN REMOVAL TEST:<br>
The stain removal evaluation of standard soils has been done considering Y, the reflectance value has been used for performance evaluation. The X Y Z scale has been used with a spectrophotometer with the UV-filter at 4 60 nm.<br>
Y = 100 means a complete stain removal.<br>
Standard prepared stains have been used for the test.<br>
Standard stains (aged stain):<br><br>
*Empa Test Materials in Switzerland WFK Testgewebe GmbH in Germany C.F.T.-Center For Test materials B.V. in The Netherlands<br>
i       The cleaning procedure is done by applying the cream to the stain, leave it for 10 minutes and then rinsing with water. In case of gadget use the cream application is done with the gadget and then three scrubbing actions<br><br>
are done back and forward with the cellular plastic device.<br>
EXAMPLES:<br>
The cellular plastic device described for preparing the foam was compared to the simple mixing with the spoon, with a hand propeller system, with a ocappuccino cream maker, with a shaker and with a battery powered mixer. In all cases 15 grams of Oxi Action Max powder has been dissolved in 100 ml of warm water, prior to using the devices.<br>
The cellular plastic device cleaning performance has been compared to just applying the foam onto the stain with a spoon and then rinsing.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
* Multi-use: can be used for foam preparation,<br>
application onto the stain and for cleaning through scrubbing.<br>
The cellular sponge gadget is a manual system that has been rated as the more convenient among the different manual tools, it is very effective in preparing the foam, short time and good foam consistency. The cellular plastic device is in addition quite cheap and it can be used also for foam application onto the stain and for improving the cleaning performance.<br>
Results for stain removal:<br>
The cellular plastic device of the present invention was been used to prepare the foam by dissolving 15 g of Vanish Oxi Action Max in 100 ml of water and compared to the use of the spoon. In both cases two grams of the foam were applied onto each standard soiled swatch. In the case of the cellular plastic device 3 scrubbing back and forwards have been conducted on each swatch. Then the foam was left for 10 minutes before rinsing with cold water.  After 10 minutes of the foam action all samples were rinsed.<br><br>
For each device /stain for replicates were performed and the values reported in the table below are the average.<br><br>
There is a visible cleaning improvement in using the cellular plastic device- This is due to two factors: the scrubbing action and the adsorption of the foam into the stain.<br>
Stable Foam Formation<br>
The stable foam is prepared by dissolving the cleaning formulation , from 1 to 50 grams in 100 ml of water, preferably between 10 and 30 grams into 100ml of water.<br><br>
The stable foam is formed due to the source of active oxygen evolving oxygen within a surfactant.<br>
RESULTS:<br>
The foam described in this invention have been tested in terms of stain removal and colour safety, using Oxy Magic and Oxiclean as references.<br>
STAIN REMOVAL TEST:<br>
The stain removal evaluation of standard soils has been done considering Y, the reflectance value has been used for performance evaluation. The X Y Z scale has been used with a spectrophotometer with the UV-filter at 4 60 nm.<br>
Y = 100 means a complete stain removal.<br>
Standard prepared stains have been used for the test.<br><br><br>
*Empa Test Materials in Switzerland WFK Testgewebe GmbH in Germany C.F.T.-Center For Test materials B.V. in The Netherlands<br>
The cleaning procedure is performed by applying the foam to the stain, leave it for 10 minutes and then rinsing with water.<br>
COLOUR DAMAGE TEST:<br>
To check for possible colour damage to dyed fabric the cleaning procedure has been done with a 30 minute contact time of the foam on coloured swatches and a high concentrated foam obtained by dissolving 30 grams of cleaning product with 100 ml of warm water. Oxiclean formulation has been used as a reference of a product well established in the market.<br><br>
The colour safety has been measured by instrumental<br>
readings.<br>
The instrumental analysis has been carried out<br>
considering delta E values between the unwashed and the<br>
washed fabric swatches.<br><br>
The L*a*b* scale has been used with a spectrophotometer with the UV-filter at 460 nm. AE is defined as per each coloured fabric considered as:<br>
AE=[(LC*-LW*)2 + (a*c-a*w)2 + (bc*-bw*)2]1/2<br>
Where:<br>
L* = reflectance<br>
a* = redness/greenness<br>
b* = yellowness/blueness<br>
c = unwashed coloured fabric<br>
w - washed coloured fabric<br>
AE equals 0 means no colour damage and in general the lower the value the lower the colour damage.<br>
EXAMPLES:<br>
The foams described in this invention were prepared by using powder formulations easily produced by mixing in a suitable container the ingredients. The foam was prepared by dissolving 15 grams of the cleaning formulation of this invention in 100 ml of warm water (40°C) and mixing for 3 minutes. The foam was applied for 10 minutes before rinsing with cold water (20°C). Product available on the market, Oxy Magic from Dr. Beckmann and Oxiclean new from Orange glo were used as references. These two products have been tested with the same procedure even if it was not possible to make a stable foam, but only a solution or a slightly foaming solution.<br><br><br><br>
EXAMPLE RESULTS:<br>
Foams were prepared by using Ex 1, 2 and 3, for all dissolving 15 g and 30 grams in 100 ml of warm water and mixing for 3 minutes.<br>
Results for stain removal:<br>
The formulation of present invention have been used as a foam by dissolving 15 g in 100 ml of water and applying 2 ml of the foam onto each stain. After 10 minutes of contact with the foam all samples were rinsed. The reference products  were used at the same dosage. Four replicates were made and the values reported in the table below is the average.<br><br><br>
Results for colour safety:<br>
Oxiclean powder has been used as a reference. Three replicates have been considered for each product/colour type and the values reported in the table below are averages.<br><br>
A value of delta E below 3.0 can be considered as no colour damage.<br><br>
