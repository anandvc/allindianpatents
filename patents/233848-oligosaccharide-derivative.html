				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
OLIGOSACCHARIDE DERIVATIVE<br>
(TECHNICAL FIELD)<br>
The present invention relates to a novel oligosaccharide<br>
derivative, its pharmacologically acceptable salts and its<br>
pharmacologically acceptable esters.<br>
The present invention also relates to an oligosaccharide<br>
derivative having actions including a-amylase inhibitory action,<br>
blood glucose lowering action and lipid lowering action, its<br>
pharmacologically acceptable salts and its pharmacologically<br>
acceptable esters.<br>
Moreover, the present invention relates to a therapeutic<br>
drug and/or preventive drug for a disease such as, hyperglycemia,<br>
post prandial hyperglycemia, impaired glucose tolerance (IGT),<br>
diabetes mellitus, obesity, hyperlipemia, fatty liver,<br>
hepatomegaly, diabetic complications, neuropathy,<br>
arteriosclerosis, cataract or diabetic nephropathy (and<br>
preferably a therapeutic drug and/or preventive drug for<br>
hyperglycemia or diabetes mellitus) containing as its active<br>
ingredient an oligosaccharide derivative, its pharmacologically<br>
acceptable salts or its pharmacologically acceptable esters.<br>
Moreover, the present invention relates to a preventive<br>
drug or therapeutic drug for the aforementioned diseases<br>
containing as its active ingredient the aforementioned compound,<br>
a composition for preventing or treating the aforementioned<br>
diseases containing as its active ingredient the aforementioned<br>
compound, the use of the aforementioned compound to produce a<br>
pharmaceutical for preventing or treating the aforementioned<br>
diseases, or a prevention or treatment method for the<br>
aforementioned diseases in which a pharmacologically effective<br>
amount of the aforementioned compound is administered to a<br>
mammal (and preferably to a human).<br>
(BACKGROUND ART)<br><br>
In the past, digestive enzyme inhibitors such as Basen<br>
(Takeda Pharmaceutical), containing voglibose, and Glucobay<br>
(Bayer), containing acarbose, have actually been used clinically<br>
as effective therapeutic drugs for hyperglycemia. However,<br>
since both compounds inhibit a-glucosidase, they have the<br>
disadvantages of causing adverse side effects such as abdominal<br>
distention, flatulence, increased abdominal wind, soft stools,<br>
diarrhea and abdominal pain. Moreover, they have also been<br>
reported to cause liver function disorders.<br>
On the other hand, effects causing inhibition of the<br>
absorption of nutrients are known to be obtainable by inhibiting<br>
not only a-glucosidase, but a-amylase as well, and compounds are<br>
known that lower blood glucose levels without causing the<br>
aforementioned adverse side effects unique to a-glucosidase<br>
inhibitors. However, the a-amylase inhibitory activity of these<br>
compounds is weak, and there are no compounds known that have<br>
adequate a-amylase inhibitory activity.<br>
Compounds having a partial structure (sugar derivative)<br>
that is in common with the oligosaccharide derivative of the<br>
present invention that demonstrate a-amylase inhibitory activity<br>
have been disclosed (see, for example, International Publication<br>
WO 00/50434 and International Publication WO 01/94367). However,<br>
these compounds differ from the compound of the present<br>
invention in that they are required to have a deoxynojirimycin<br>
backbone or a hexahydfo-3,5, 6-trihydroxy-1H-azepine backbone.<br>
(DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION)<br>
a-amylase inhibitors are required to be resistant to<br>
degradation in the digestive tract (and particularly the small<br>
intestine) and demonstrate stable action. However, since<br>
previously reported a-amylase inhibitors cannot be said to<br>
demonstrate adequate stability in the small intestine, there is<br>
a possibility that they cannot demonstrate adequate<br>
pharmacological effects stably. In addition, this instability<br>
in the digestive tract (and particularly the small intestine)<br><br>
results in the risk of having some form of effect on liver<br>
function resulting from absorption of their degradation products.<br>
Therefore, the inventors of the present invention<br>
conducted extensive research for the purpose of developing a<br>
therapeutic drug and/or preventive drug for diseases such as<br>
hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus that has superior a-amylase<br>
inhibitory activity and high stability, and found that a novel<br>
oligosaccharide derivative has superior a-amylase inhibitory<br>
action, blood glucose lowering action and lipid lowering action,<br>
improves diseases such as hyperglycemia, post prandial<br>
hyperglycemia, hyperglycemia, impaired glucose tolerance (1GT),<br>
diabetes mellitus, obesity, hyperlipemia, fatty liver,<br>
hepatomegaly, diabetic complications, neuropathy,<br>
arteriosclerosis, cataract and diabetic nephropathy, and has<br>
high stability, thereby leading to completion of the present<br>
invention.<br>
Namely, the present invention provides an<br>
oligosaccharide derivative, its pharmacologically acceptable<br>
salts and its pharmacologically acceptable esters, which are<br>
useful as therapeutic drugs or preventive drugs for diseases<br>
such as hyperglycemia, post prandial hyperglycemia, impaired<br>
glucose tolerance (IGT), diabetes mellitus, obesity,<br>
hyperlipemia, fatty liver, hepatomegaly, diabetic complications<br>
(such as retinopathy, nephropathy and neuropathy), neuropathy,<br>
arteriosclerosis, cataract and diabetic nephropathy.<br>

a-Amylase Inhibitory Action<br>
(1) Preparation of Human a-Amylase Solution<br>
"Caribzyme AMY" (International Reagents) was used for<br><br>
the human pancreatic a-amylase (HPA). Purified water was added<br>
to the commercially available HPA and dissolved to a<br>
concentration of 200 IU/1 to prepare an a-amylase solution. The<br>
activity of the a-amylase was measured using a commercially<br>
available a-amylase assay reagent ("Neo-Amylase Test Daiichi",<br>
Daiichi Pure Chemicals).<br>
(2) Preparation of Inhibitory Solutions<br>
Each test compound was prepared with distilled water to<br>
a final concentration of 0.1 to 30 µg/ml, respectively.<br>
(3) Measurement of Human a-Amylase Inhibitory Activity of<br>
Inhibitory Solutions<br>
3.78 to 3.9 ml of distilled water and 0 to 120 µl of<br>
inhibitory solution were added to 100 µl of HPA solution and<br>
adjusted to a total volume of A ml. After incubating for 10<br>
minutes at 37°C, a blue starch tablet ("Neo-Amylase Test<br>
Daiichi", Daiichi Pure Chemicals) was added followed by stirring<br>
for about 10 seconds with a mixer and heating for 30 minutes at<br>
37°C. Subsequently, 1.0 ml of 0.5 N aqueous sodium hydroxide<br>
solution was added followed by stirring to stop the reaction,<br>
after which the mixture was centrifuged (1,500 G, 5 minutes) and<br>
the absorbance of the resulting supernatant was measured at 620<br>
nm. A mixture to which inhibitory solution had not been added<br>
was used as a control. In addition, distilled water was added<br>
instead of a-amylase for use as a blank. The inhibition rate<br>
was calculated according to the following formula, and the final<br>
concentration of test compound required to inhibit the activity<br>
of the HPA solution by 50% (µg/ml) was taken to be the IC50<br>
value. Those values are shown in Table 6.<br>
Inhibition rate (%) = [l-{(Absorbance of control) - (absorbance<br>
of blank)}/{(absorbance when inhibitor added) - (absorbance of<br>
blank)}] x 100<br>
It was found from Table 6 that compounds of the present<br>
invention have superior a-amylase inhibitory action.<br><test example><br>

control group was administered with a similar suspension in the<br>
same manner with the exception of not containing the test<br>
compound.<br><br>
Blood samples were collected from a tail vein of the<br>
mice before dosing and at 0.5, 1, 2 and 3 hours after dosing<br>
followed by measurement of blood glucose levels and calculation<br>
of the inhibition rate (%) according to the following formula<br>
from the area under the curve (AUC) of the increase in blood<br>
glucose levels (area under the curve of the change in increases<br>
in blood glucose levels, mg/dlxhr). Blood glucose levels were<br>
measured using a blood glucose analyzer (Glucoloader GXT, A &amp; T)<br>
Inhibition rate (%) = [l-(dose group AUC/control group blood<br>
glucose increase AUC)] x 100<br>
According to Table 7, compounds of the present invention<br>
were determined to have superior action in inhibiting increases<br>
in blood glucose levels. Thus, compounds of the present<br>

Blood glucose levels were measured before the start of<br>
dosing and one week after the start of dosing. Blood samples<br>
were collected from a tail vein and blood glucose levels were<br>
measured using a blood glucose analyzer (Glucoloader GXT, A &amp; T)<br>
to calculate the blood glucose lowering rate (%) according to<br>
the following formula.<br>
Blood glucose lowering rate (%) = [1-(compound dose group blood<br>
