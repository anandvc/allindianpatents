				<td>Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to an improved process for making chamois leather. More particularly, the present invention relates to a process for making chamois leather using modified plant oil, whereby the use of conventional fish oil is totally replaced. The present invention has enormous application in leather industry for making chamois leather, which is one of the most popular articles of commerce. This kind of leather finds potential application for making clothing and gloving. Thus, the present invention has enormous relevance for apparel and gloving industry. Chamois leather may also be used for cleaning purposes.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
Conventionally, chamois leather is made from sheep, goat or lamb skin primarily by oil tanning technique. The tannage is essentially effected by coating the delimed skins with unsaturated fish oils having iodine value more than 120 followed by exposing oil treated skins to warm humid air when oxidation and polymerization of the oil occur in situ on the leather fibre. Subsequently surplus oil is removed either by washing with aqueous alkali, or anionic or non ionic surfactants, or by solvents. The major limitation associated with this process is that the resulting leather is very soft making it difficult for mechanical operations like shaving.<br>
To obviate this limitation, there has been a practice among the tanners to pretreat the delimed skins with formaldehyde to effect formaldehyde-oil combination tannage, whereby the delimed skins are pre-treated with 1.5 to 2 percent formalin, in alkaline condition at a pH of 8.3 - 8.5 for 2 to 3 hours. The skins are kept in the solution overnight, horsed up next day and shaved to required thickness.<br>
After shaving, the skins are tumbled or drummed with 20 to 25 percent Cod or fish oil mixed with half percent soda. After 4 hours of tumbling or drumming the skins are hanged on hooks for oxidation in a chamber maintained at controlled temperature and humidity of 60Â± 5%. The alkali reduces the acidity of leather, formed during oxidation. The oil tanning, the effect of which becomes pronounced with the change of the colour of the skin towards that of mustard, usually takes time as long as 12 days. The dried skins are then washed with 1 to 2% soda ash in 100% water (on skin weight) at least 3 to 4 times to remove unreacted oil.<br>
Our co pending Indian patent application No: 312 Del 2004 dt 27.02.2004 provides a process for making chamois leather by treating conventional delimed or alkyl aldehyde treated skin with 20% fish oil having iodine value not less than 120, followed by ozonation and subsequent air drying. This process has essentially been able to reduce the oxidation time to around 1 hour. But this necessitates use of ozone generating equipment. It is evident from all the foregoing disclosures that fish oil has been the primary material of choice for making chamois leather. Even though this leather is traditionally produced using fish oil, the major limitation associated with this material is that oils, obtained even from the same species differ in their tanning characteristics. Thus, properties of the conventional fish oil tanned chamois leathers exhibits significant inconsistency and non- uniformity, affecting the trade adversely.<br>
Another major limitation of the fish oil tanned chamois leather is the strong and pungent odour of the oil remains in the leather and this smell is not preferred by many. This also affects the trade in chamois leather to a great extent.<br>
Use of alternative oils did not yield satisfactory functional, or aesthetic or safely requirements of chamois leathers. Krishnan et al (Journal of the Society of Leather Technologists and Chemists, 89, 260 - 262, 2005) have used Jatropha oil for chamois making. But these<br>
chamois leathers had lower water absorption characteristics than fish oil tanned chamois leathers. Further Jatropha oil due to lower acid value and high moisture content of the skins posed difficulties in through and through penetration in to the fibre matrix resulting in uneven surface and bulk properties. The major limitation with the simple replacement of fish oil with Jatropha oil resulted in less water absorption. The modern day requirements of chamois leather demands water absorption &gt; 350% of the weight of the leather. Hence just use of Jatropha oil as a substitute for fish oil is not sufficient for producing chamois leather meeting present day requirements.<br>
Olivannan and Iqbal (Suede and chamois leathers, Process Bulletin 7, CLRI Publication, edited by Ranganathan et al, pp. 48-50, 1984) have explored possibilities of using linseed oil for chamois leather making. The study indicated that linseed oil could replace fish oil only to an extent of 30% - 50%. Linseed oil gets oxidized rapidly leading to formation of polymerized products. It is likely that during tanning the polymeric product of linseed oil may completely cover the fibre thereby preventing entry of water between the fibres. This is confirmed by the sink test, which takes more than 3 minutes when linseed oil content is more. Further linseed oil is a quick drying oil, so it produces leathers with dry and harsh surface characteristics.<br>
The paper by Krishnan, et al. 2005 in the Journal of the society of leather technologists and chemists; 89 [6] : 260-262, deals with the use of raw Jatropha oil for processing chamois leathers. The major limitation with the simple replacement offish oil with Jatropha oil resulted in less water absorption, whereas the modern day requirements of chamois leather demands water absorption &gt; 350% of the weight of the leather. Hence, the mere use of Jatropha oil as such as a substitute for fish oil is not sufficient for producing chamois leather meeting present day requirements.<br>
,"he present invention therefore emphasizes on an approach to modify the plant oil not only for enhancing the functional properties thereof but also to modify the characteristics suitably to overcome the inherent limitations. While in the case of Jatropha oil, as mentioned in example 1, treatment with alkene diol has resulted in enhancement of functional properties, in the case of Linseed oil the characteristics of the oil has undergone substantial modification. Hitherto, only 50% replacement offish oil with linseed oil had been possible for making chamois (Ref already cited in prior art). But with the modifications made in the present invention it had been possible to replace fish oil.<br>
The present invention thus addmisses two issues one enhancing functional properties and two makes available natural product (linseed oil) for chamois making adding to the needed resource for leather making.<br>
The invention should be construed as a minor step but should be viewed by totality taking into consideration the impact it would make in the field it is meant for.<br>
No prior art is available for modification of plant oil for chamois making.<br>
The novelty of the present invention resides in the treatment of the plant oil suitably to enhance the water absorption characteristics of the oil without losing the tanning potency of the oil. The modification of the oil, further helps in diffusion and distribution of oil uniformly as the oil is treated with skin with &gt; 50% moisture. The moisture in the skin prevented uniform diffusion and distribution of oil leading to non - uniform and inconsistent quality. Hence through modification of oil, an improved process for making chamois leathers has been developed<br><br>
Objectives of the invention<br>
The main objective of the present invention is thus to provide an improved process of making<br>
chamois leathers, which obviates the limitations as stated above.<br>
Another objective of the present invention is to provide a  process, wherein the water<br>
absorption characteristics of the chamois leather obtained using plant oil is comparable to<br>
the one obtained using fish oil.<br>
Yet another objective of the present invention is to provide a process of oxidation of skins<br>
without resulting in any harshness on the leather surface.<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
The present invention deals with the modification of plant oil for use in chamois leather making. Hitherto efforts made for replacement of fish oil with plant oil have not been successful. The invention deals with treatment of plant oil with an alkene diol in order to prevent uncontrolled polymerization oils during oxidation without adversely affecting the tanning potency.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides an improved process for making chamois leathers which comprises<br>
(i) reacting 8 to 10% by weight of alkene diol with plant oil preferably under stirring condition, for a period of not less than 60' at a temperature in the range of 40-45Â°C to obtain an oil mixture,<br>
(ii) treating conventional delimed skin/hide optionally pretreated with an alkyl aldehyde with not less than 20% by weight of the oil mixture , as obtained in step (i), for a period of not less than 6 hours followed by drying at a temperature not exceeding 45Â°C to obtain chamois leather.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, the alkene diol used is selected from ethylene glycol, propylene glycol.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention the plant oil used is selected from Jatropha oil, linseed oil.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention the alkyl aldehyde used is selected from glutaraldehyde, formaldehyde.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention the amount of alkyl aldehyde used is in the range of 0.5 - 3.0% by weight on the weight of delimed skin/hide.<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention, the method of drying of skins/hides may be such as open air drying, forced hot air drying.<br>
Detailed description of the Invention<br>
Plant oil is reacted with 8 to 10% by weight of alkene diol, preferably under stirring condition, for a period of not less than 60 minutes at a temperature in the range of 40-45Â°C to obtain an oil mixture.<br>
The conventional delimed skin/hide is optionally pretreated with an alkyl aldehyde and is tanned with not less than 20% by weight of the oil mixture for a period of not less than 6 hours. The skin is then dried at a temperature not exceeding 45Â°C to obtain chamois leather.<br>
The inventive step of the present invention lies in the use of modified plant oil under specified conditions for effecting oil tannage without using fish oil to produce chamois leather.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
The following examples are given by way of illustration only and therefore should not be construed to limit the scope of the present invention.<br>
Example 1<br>
The oil mixture was prepared by mixing 100 gms of Jatropha oil and 8 gms of ethylene glycol under stirring for a period of 90' at a temperature 40Â°C. One piece of delimed goat skin weighing 500 grams was treated with 10 gms of glutaraldehyde for 120 minutes. 100 gms of the composition prepared was weighed out, applied on both grain and flesh sides of the skin and the balance amount was added to the experimental drum. The skin was then drummed for 8 hours and then hooked for oxidation and drying in open air at a temperature of 37Â±2Â°C. The dried chamois leather was then stored for use.<br>
Example 2<br>
The oil mixture was prepared by mixing 200 gms of linseed oil and 20 gms of propylene glycol under stirring for a period of 60' at a temperature in the range of 45Â°C. 150 gms of the composition prepared was weighed out and applied on both grain and flesh sides of two delimed sheep skins weighing 600 gms and the balance was added to the experimental drum. The skins were drummed for 6 hours and then hooked for oxidation and drying in hot air room at a temperature of 40i2Â°C. The dried chamois leathers were then stored for use.<br>
Example 3<br>
The oil mixture was prepared by mixing 5000 gms of Linseed oil and 450 gms of ethylene glycol under stirring for a period of 75' at a temperature in the range of 45Â°C. 1600 gms of the composition prepared was weighed out and applied on both grain and flesh sides of the delimed cow hide weighing 8 kilos and the balance was added to the experimental drum. The hide was drummed for 10 hours and then hooked for oxidation and drying in hot air room at a temperature of 40i2Â°C. The dried chamois leather was then stored for use.<br>
