				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The invention relates to a drafting assembly of a ring spinning frame with a condenser for a sliver, according to the preamble of patent claim 1. The invention also relates to components for the apphcation in a drafting assembly designed according to the invention.<br>
The conversion of natural and artificial fibres into a yam demands a series of part working procedures. The last working step is usually called fine spinning. With this, the spun yam obtains its final fineness and strength. The fine spinning requires a considerable proportion of the expenditure of the whole yam manufacturing process. Ring spinning known from the state of the art comes closest to the classic hand spinning with spinning wheels. With this, the spun yam is round onto a rotating spinning spindle. Essentially tliree machines are required for ring spinning. A roving which is also called a carded sHver is produced from a sliver by the flyer. The yam with the required fineness is produced from the roving by the ring spinning frame and spun onto a small bobbin, the cop. The winding machine then puts to yam together from many cops and produces a yam bobbin ready for use, having a weight of a few kilos.<br>
The roving is drafted to the required fineness of the thread on the ring spinning frame and the twist of the fibres required for spinning the yam is produced. The macliine as a mle has a double-sided design and on each side has a plurality of spindles -spinning locations. A drafting assembly is allocated to each spinning location. At the same time, in many cases it is the case of a so-called three-cylinder drafting assembly. Tliis drafting assembly has a prehminary drafting field and a main drafting field. The supplied roving is drafted to the desired fineness in the drafting assembly and leaves the drafting assembly at the nip line of an exit roller pair as a relatively wide sliver.<br>
This sliver is twisted with the help of the single yam twist and twisted together into the finished yam. At the same time a so called spinning triangle is formed following the nip line of the exit roller pair of the drafting assembly, in which the fibres supplied by the drafting assembly are led together and integrated into the yam structure. Not all fibres are caught in the spinning triangle. Edge fibres may become lost or become incompletely attached onto the twisted yam. The fibres located at the edges of the spinning triangle when being subjected to the twisting are strained to a considerably greater extent than the fibres located in the middle of the spinning triangle. Thus in the completed yam, the fibres lying at the periphery are therefore pretensioned to a greater<br><br><br>
extent that the fibres in the core of the yarn. Then, given a correspondingly high loading of the yarn, the fibres at the periphery which are pretensioned to a greater extent break first. For this reason, the finished twisted, yarn does not have the strength which is should have as a sum of the individual strengths of the individual fibres. The fibres which are attached in an uncontrolled manner protrude from the twisted yam and lead to an increased and undesired hairiness of the yarn. An increased yarn hairiness may be equated with a reduction in quality.<br>
In order to avoid the spinning triangle and its disadvantageous consequences as much as possible, with drafting assemblies of modem ring spinning frames, the drafting zone is supplemented by a condenser zone in which the wide sliver supplied by the roller pair is led together in a manner which is as compact as possible. Only the sliver condensed or compressed in such a manner is twisted together into the finished yarn after leaving the condenser zone. For example, a pneumatically acting condenser means is known from the brochure No. 1646e-BBAB-15 of the company Rieter, Winterthur. This known pneumatic condenser means comprises a perforated dram in which a vacuum prevails. This vacuum produces an airflow through the perforated drum and thus leads to the desired condensing of the sliver guided over the drum. Pneumatically acting condensers are expensive to procure and also in their maintenance. The production of the vacuum required for the condensing requires a great expenditure of energy. Some of the components which are required for condensing the sliver are furthermore subjected to a relatively high wear. Compact yarns manufactured by way of pneumatic condensing although being better in quality, are however significantly more expensive in manufacture that conventional ring spun yams.<br>
Drafting assemblies of ring spinning frames are also known which are equipped with condenser means acting in geometrical-mechanical manner. These as a rule are significantly more economical to realise. Each condenser means at the same time comprises a block-like condenser component which is arranged in the transport plane of the sliver. At its side which faces the sliver, the condenser unit is equipped with a groove-like condenser channel which at the entry side for the sliver widens in a funnel-like manner and is designed tapering in the transport direction of the sliver. With the transport of the sliver through the condenser component, the fibres are forced together by way of the narrowing condenser channel and are condensed to the desired extent.<br>
With one known embodiment variant, a condenser component of a relatively small construction manner is arranged in the main drafting field of the drafting assembly, between the drafting apron provided in the main drafting field and the exit roller pair.<br><br>
With this arrangement of the condenser component, the drafting and the condensing of the sliver take place simultaneously. With this however, the uniform drafting of the sliver is upset. In order to create space for the condenser component, the distance between the nip line of the exit roller pair and the drafting apron is increased. However, on account of this, the distance with which the fibres are not guided is also increased. The upset of the uniform drafting and the larger distance which the fibres need to cover in an unguided manner may lead to irregularities in the yam, which reduces its quality. The condenser components are a disturbing factor on operating the drafting assembly and may easily get lost on account of their relatively small construction size.<br>
Theoretically there also exists the possibility of arranging the geometrically-mechanically acting condenser component in a condenser zone which is arranged downstream of the drafting zone. With this arrangement, the fibres must cross the distance between the exit roller pair and a pair of supply rollers provided at the exit of the condenser zone without any supporting transport means. With many materials, for example in the case of cotton, the majority of the fibres is however shorter than the distance to be crossed in the condenser zone. For this reason, an arrangement of the condenser component in a subsequently arranged condenser zone would only be able to be realised if the sliver supplied by exit roller pair of the drafting assembly has very many fibres per unit of cross section. Only then is it ensured that the sliver supports itself to a certain extent over the distance with which is not supported by transport means. This for example is the case with prespinning machines, also called flyers. A relatively thick carded sliver is produced in the prespinning machines; from which finally the finished yarn is produced in the subsequently arranged ring spinning frame. Since ring spinning frames as a rule do not supply such compact slivers at the exit roller pair of the drafting assembly, the outlined arrangement of the condenser component in a condenser zone arranged downstream has not been suitable until now for ring spinning frames.<br>
It is the object of the invention to avoid these disadvantages of the state of the art. A drafting assembly it to be improved to the extent that high quality yarns, so-called compact yarns, are able to be produced in an inexpensive manner. At the same time the application of expensive pneumatic installations and expensive wearing parts is to be avoided. Despite the improvement of the drafting assembly, the compact construction manner of the known drafting assemblies of the state of the art is to be retained. At the same, the fact that the improvement according to the invention may be able to be applied also to already existing ring spinning frames without having to carry out expensive conversion for this is particularly to be taken into account.<br><br>
The solution of these objects lies in a drafting assembly of a ring spinning frame with a condenser for a sliver which has the features specified in the characterising part of patent claim 1. Further formations and/or advantageous embodiment variants of the invention are the subject-matter of the dependent claims.<br>
The invention envisages the geometrically-mechanically acting condenser component which comprises a condensing channel to be arranged in a condenser zone arranged after the drafting zone, and for transport means to be provided, which support the sliver in the condenser zone.<br>
The solution according to the invention avoids the previously outlined disadvantages of drafting assemblies with which the condenser components are arranged in the main drafting zones. The problems of a condenser zone arranged after the drafting zone are avoided by way of the fact that the sliver practically along its whole transport path through the condenser zone is supported by transport means. Drafting no longer takes place in the condenser zone. The yarn is very uniformly condensed by the condenser component, which has an advantageous effect on the yarn quality. By way of the solution according to the invention one may do away with the application of expensive pneumatically acting condenser means. Yarn irregularities which may result with drafting assemblies with condenser elements arranged in the drafting zone are avoided by way of the arrangement according to the invention in a condenser zone arranged downstream. The resulting yarn quality is good and is particularly competitive with regard to significantly lower productions costs.<br>
In one very advantageous embodiment variant of the invention, the transport means for the sliver in the condenser zone are formed by a lower cylinder on which the exit press roller and the delivery press roller are supported. With this embodiment variant, the condenser zone runs along a peripheral section of the lower cylinder. The lower cylinder with respect to an exit lower cylinder of known conventional drafting assemblies may have an increased diameter so that both rollers, the exit press roller and the delivery press roller may find space behind one another more easily and the condenser component may be easily arranged between the two rollers. This is particularly advantageous with ring spinning frames for short staple processing. Even with an enlarged diameter of the lower cylinder, the embodiment variant is still distinguished by a very compact construction manner. The drafting assembly formed in such a manner is only slightly longer than a conventional drafting assembly. The sliver is supported along the whole longitudinal extension of the condenser zone by the surface of the lower cylinder.<br>
The exit press roller and the delivery press roller are advantageously assembled on a holder pressed against the lower cylinder by way of spring force. By way of this for example a central leaf spring is sufficient for the loading of one or both press rollers. The leaf spring is fastened on the holder and is supported on a stationary component of the drafting assembly. The loading spring may also be assembled on a stationary component and be supported against the holder. For example the stationary component is the press arm which presses the press rollers of the drafting assembly which are arranged in each case at the top, in particular of the drafting zone, towards the lower rollers or the lower cylinder.<br>
The transport path of the sliver extends from an exit nip line of the exit press roller with the lower cylinder up to the supply nip line of the delivery press roller with the lower cylinder. Its length is smaller than the length of a third of the fibres embedded into the sliver. By way of this one succeeds in controlling the fibre transport in the condensing zone by way of the doubly clamped fibres, these are all those fibres whose length is larger than the length of the transport path through the condensing zone. A disruption of the uniformity of the sliver caused for example by the braking effect of the condenser component on the fibres is avoided by way of this.<br>
The condenser component acting in a geometric-mechanical manner comprises a condenser channel. This may be arranged on that lower side of the condenser component which faces the lower cylinder, or on that upper side of the condenser component which faces the press rollers. In any case it has been shown to be advantageous if the condenser component in its operational position lies on the lower cylinder without play and presses against this with a force which may be set. By way of this it is avoided that fibres get between the lower cylinder and the contact surface of the condenser components in an uncontrolled manner. The pressing force of the condenser component against the lower cylinder is for example produced by its intrinsic weight or by way of a mechanical bias or by way of the force of a magnet.<br>
In a particularly simple embodiment variant of the drafting assembly, the condenser component is connected to a clasp which resiliency engages around the lower cylinder over a periphery of more than 180°. The clasp with the condenser component fastened thereto is carried along on rotation of the lower cylinder until a continuation projecting from the clasp and/or the condenser component is supported on a stationary component of the drafting assembly, preferably on the arbor of the delivery press roller.<br>
By way of this simple design manner, the condenser component is positioned exactly with respect to the nip line between the delivery press roller and the lower cylinder.<br>
Given a lifted delivery press roller, and a lower cylinder continuing to rotate, in order to prevent the clasp together with the condenser component from co-rotating with the lower cylinder, a projecting abutment is provided on the clasp which during the operation is located at a short distance to a stationary component of the drafting assembly. If the delivery press roller is lifted and on account of this the continuation on the clasp and/or the condenser component is released, then the clasp with the condenser component may only follow the rotational movement of the lower cylinder until the abutment stands at the stationary component of the drafting assembly. For example the stationary component is a deflection rail for a drawing apron in the drafting assembly. If the delivery press roller is moved back again into the operational position, the press roller arbor presses against the continuation and by way of this brings the condenser back into its operational position.<br>
For reasons of design, it has been shown to be useful if each clasp carries two condenser components which are arranged on both sides of the centrally arranged clasp.<br>
hi a very simple and inexpensive embodiment variant of the invention, the clasp and the condenser component or the condenser components are formed as one piece. Preferably they are manufactured of plastic in mass-production technology, for example by way of the injection moulding method.<br>
hi a further design variant of the invention, the condenser component in its operational position is also supported on the delivery press roller. The exit press roller is not contacted by the condenser component. The radii of the support surfaces of the condenser component are largely matched to the radii of the supporting lower cylinder and of the delivery press roller. This, in particular with the support surface opposite the lower cylinder, has the advantage that no fibres may get between the support surface of the condenser component and the lower cylinder.<br>
hi order to prevent the condenser component being clamped between the delivery press roller and the lower cylinder, the support surface of the condenser component is usefully designed in a manner such that a bearing region results on the delivery press roller, which runs roughly perpendicularly to the plane of the drafting assembly. The condenser component at the same time lies on the lower cylinder without play. So that an undesired widening of the condensed sliver may not occur after the condenser<br>
component, the exit of the condenser component is led as close as possible up to the nip line of the delivery press roller with the lower cylinder. In order however to prevent the condenser component becoming clamped between the delivery press roller and the lower cylinder, the condenser component does not extend completely up to the nip line and does not contact the delivery press roller here.<br>
In one advantageous embodiment variant of the invention, the condenser component may be lifted together with the delivery press roller from the lower cylinder. With this embodiment variant the condenser element when required may be lifted, for example if the nip line of the delivery press roller is to be lifted briefly so that the yarn twist continues into the condenser zone.<br>
In order to realise the possibility of the condenser component being able to be lifted in an as simple as possible manner, the condenser component above the region of the smallest distance between the exit press roller and the delivery press roller is designed in a widened manner such that it may be lifted together with the two press rollers. On lifting the rollers, the condenser component is then simply carried along.<br>
In a further advantageous embodiment variant of the invention the condenser component is equipped with one or more permanent magnets. The permanent magnets cooperate with the transport means for the sliver, in particular with the lower cylinder. By way of this it is ensured that the condenser component lies snugly on the lower cylinder and may not slightly lift even with oscillations of the machine, and it is ensured that no fibres may get between the condenser component and the lateral surface of the lower cylinder.<br>
For the uniformity of the yarn it is also useful if the condenser component is secured axially in an immovable manner with respect to the delivery press roller. This for example is effected by lugs or projections on the condenser component which engage over the side surfaces of the delivery press roller or the exit press roller. The lugs or projections are for example plastic bungs which are firmly connected to the condenser component. A coloured marking on the projections or lugs may serve as an indicator for the cross section of the condenser channel. From this the user may directly read off for which yarn region the respective condenser is suitable.<br>
The condenser component and where appropriate the clasp connected thereto may consists of plastic, of a ceramic material or of metal, for example of steel or brass.<br>
In order to prevent the fibres from uncontrollably getting between the lower cylinder and the geometrically-mechanically acting condenser component, it is useful if the lower cylinder comprises a peripheral surface which is free from interruptions, openings or likewise and is formed in a largely smooth manner. By way of the smooth surface the condenser component lies in close contact to the peripheral surface, and the fibres may only go into the condenser channel. The use of a smooth cylinder is of no disadvantage for a uniform drafting of the sliver since the fibres exiting from the drafting zone are clamped twice, one after the other. A fibre which at the exit nip line, the exit from the drafting zone, has not yet assumed the full peripheral speed of the lower cylinder obtains this at the latest at the supply nip line, at the exit of the condenser zone. The slight tension in the longitudinal direction which on account of this is exerted onto those fibres whose length is larger than the length of the transport path through the condenser zone supports the effect of the condenser component in an advantageous manner.<br>
With a smooth design of the peripheral surface of the lower cylinder it has been shown to be advantageous if the peripheral surface of the lower cylinder, at least in the region of the course of the sliver, has a friction value which is high with respect to the fibres. This for example is achieved in that the peripheral surface of the lower cylinder at least in the region of the course of the sliver is chemically or electrolytically treated or coated. For example the peripheral surface of the lower cylinder at least in the region of the course of the sliver is provided with a nickel-diamond coating.<br>
In one advantageous formation of the drafting assembly according to the invention a mechanically acting sliver guide is arranged in front of the exit of the drafting zone, in front of the exit press roller. At the same time the sliver guide is aligned in a manner such that its guide channel for the sliver runs roughly centrally to a condenser channel of the condenser component. The mechanical sliver guide at the exit of the drafting zone prevents a portion of the fibres from being transported past the condenser channel when the sliver is supplied obliquely to the entry opening of the condenser component. The sliver during its transport may also suffer a lateral displacement with respect to its nominal location on account of non-homogeneities in the strength of the drafted sliver, non-uniform wear of the exit press roller and/or of the lower cylinder. The lateral displacement may lead to the fact that peripheral regions of the sliver are led past the condenser channel to the delivery press roller. This leads to a worsening of the yarn quality. The mechanical sliver guide counteracts this in that by way of a mechanical, lateral guide, it prevents lateral regions of the sliver from being transported past the entry of the condenser channel. At the same time it has been shown<br>
to be advantageous if the sliver guide has an effective passage width which is smaller than the width of the condenser channel at the entry into the condenser component. The effective passage with of the sliver guide at the same time, as a rule, is the width of its guide channel at its exit or in its direct vicinity. The guide channel may be equipped with two lateral guide walls running roughly parallel. It may however also be designed slightly tapering in its width from the entry to the exit in front of the exit press roller.<br>
In a further embodiment variant of the invention it may be envisaged for the sliver guide to be arranged in a laterally displaceable manner. When required the sliver guide then together with the condenser component is laterally movable roughly perpendicularly to the transport direction of the sliver. By way of coupling the lateral displacement ability of the sliver guide and of the condenser component, it is ensured that the relative alignment of the two components to one another also remains, even with a lateral displacement.<br>
The ring spinning frame according to the invention is advantageously provided with one variant of the drafting assembly according to the invention. Such ring spinning frames are in the position of delivering inexpensive compact yarns whose quality is comparable to that of the relatively expensive compact yarns which are produced in the machines of the state of the art.<br>
The drafting assembly designed according to the invention is for example a component of newly designed and constructed ring spinning frames. The design according to the invention permits already existing drafting assemblies of ring spinning frames to be converted. For this, in one advantageous embodiment variant one may provide a press roller unit which is applied at the location of an existing exit press roller of a drafting assembly. The press roller unit comprises an exit press roller and a delivery press roller which are assembled on a common holder. A leaf spring or likewise projects from the holder, which in the assembled condition is supported on a stationary component of the drafting assembly and presses the press roller pair against the lower cylinder of the drafting assembly. With the press roller unit which is relatively simple with regard to design, an existing drafting assembly of the state of the art within the context of the invention may be supplemented with a subsequently arranged condenser zone.<br>
At the same time it has been shown to be useful if in each case two associated press rollers are assembled to the left and right of a centrally arranged holder. The press roller pairs which belong to one another are in each case arranged in pairs and are<br>
assembled on a stationary component of the drafting assembly via the holder. The stationary component is advantageously the press arm which presses the respective press rollers of the drafting assembly which are arranged above, in particular of the drafting zone, towards the lower rollers or the lower cylinder.<br>
The press roller unit is preferably provided with a condenser component which in each case is held in the gap between an associated press roller pair in an manner such that it cannot be lost. The condenser component at the same time advantageously comprises an essentially prismatic body with a roughly triangular cross section. The radii of its support surfaces are matched largely to the radii of the supporting lower cylinder and of the delivery press roller of the drafting assembly. Magnets are arranged in the body for fixing the condenser component on the lower cylinder. For reasons of lower wear, a more exact machining ability and the accuracy, the condenser component preferably consists of a ceramic material or a plastic ceramic mixture. It may however also be manufactured of plastic or of metal.<br>
In one advantageous formation, the press roller unit also comprises a mechanical sliver guide. The sliver guide is for example arranged on the exit press roller such that it cannot be lost. In the assembled condition, the sliver guide is arranged in the drafting zone of the drafting assembly. The sliver guide has a guide channel for the sliver which is arranged roughly centrally to the condenser channel of the condenser component and has an effective opening width which is smaller than the width of the condenser channel at the entry into the condenser component. This embodiment variant of the press roller unit contains all components which make up a drafting assembly according to the invention and are required for a uniform and inexpensive manufacture of high quality yarns.<br>
As a further improvement, with regard to the press roller unit it may further be envisaged for the sliver guide and the condenser component to be arranged laterally displaceable and when required to be able to be displaced laterally together. The coupling of the lateral displacement ability of the sliver guide and of the condenser part when required permits a targeted lateral displacement of the transport path of the sliver through condenser zone, for example in order to uniformly wear the exit and delivery press rollers and/or the lower cylinder.<br>
In a further embodiment variant of the invention, one may envisage the press roller unit to be offered as a set together with the lower cylinder. At the same time the lower cylinder is advantageously provided with a smooth peripheral surface which at<br>
least in the region of the course of the sliver has an increased friction value with respect to the fibres. This for example is achieved by way of chemically or electrolytically treating or coating the peripheral surface of the lower cylinder at least in the region of the course of the sliver. The peripheral surface of the lower cylinder for example at least in the region of the course of the sliver is provided with a nickel-diamond coating. The correspondingly designed lower cylinder may however also be offered as a separate replacement component.<br>
The condenser component is a component which is based on the same inventive concept as the drafting assembly according to the invention or the press roller unit for the drafting assembly, and is capable of being protected by its own right. With this, the condenser component preferably comprises an essentially prismatic body with a roughly triangular cross section. The roughly triangular, prismatic design of the body takes account of the shape of the gap between the exit press roller and the delivery press roller. The radii of the support surfaces of the condenser component are largely matched to the radii of the supporting lower cylinder and the delivery press roller of the drafting assembly. In the body of the condenser component there are arranged magnets for the fixation of the condenser component on the lower cylinder. The magnets may at the same time project directly from the support surface which faces the lower cylinder and form a part of it. The magnets however may also be applied in receiver bores in the vicinity of the support surface. For reasons of wear and due to its advantageous machining ability and accuracy, the condenser component advantageously consists of a ceramic material or a plastic-ceramic mixture.<br>
Further advantages and features of the invention are to be deduced from the subsequent description of embodiment examples of the drafting assembly. In a schematic representation are shown in:<br>
Fig. 1	a drafting assembly of a ring spinning frame of the state of the art;<br>
Fig. 2	a view of the lower surface of a condenser component;<br>
Fig. 3	a first embodiment example of the drafting assembly according to the<br>
invention, with a drafting zone and a condenser zone;<br>
Fig. 4	one variant of the condenser component arranged in the condenser zone;<br>
101, in which the fibres F supplied by the drafting assembly are led together and are integrated into the yarn structure. So that where possible all fibres are incorporated into the yam and all fibres on twisting endure a pretensioning which is as equal as possible, one strives to keep the spinning triangle as small as possible. For this reason the drafted and widened sliver F is led together again and condensed before twisting into yarn. For this, a condenser component 11 is arranged in front of the exit roller pair 108, 109 through which the sliver F is led. At the same time the sliver F is condensed in a geometric-mechanical manner by way of the construction manner of the condenser component.<br>
Fig. 2 shows one example of a condenser component 111 which has an essentially block-like shape. The condenser component 11 at its side which faces the sliver, in the operational position, is provided with a condenser channel 112 through which the sliver is led. The condenser channel 112 at its end side 114 which faces the arriving sliver is designed widened in a roughly runnel-like manner and narrows to the exit on the oppositely lying side to the desired extent. The exit width of the condenser channel determines for which yarn region the condenser component 111 is suitable.<br>
The disadvantages of this known arrangement have been already initially outlined and for emphasis are repeated with reference to the drawing of Fig. 1. With the arrangement of the condenser component 111 in the main drafting field 110 of the drafting assembly 101, between the drafting aprons 106 provided in the main drafting field 110 and the exit roller pair 108,109, the drafting and the condensing of the sliver F take place practically simultaneously. With this, the uniform drafting of the sliver F is upset, hi order to create space for the condenser component 111, the distance between the nip line A of the exit roller pair 108, 109 and the drafting aprons 106 is increased. Due to this however the distance with which the sliver F is led in a non-guided manner is also increased. The upset of the uniform drafting and the large distance which the sliver F has to cover in an non-guided manner may lead to non-uniformness in the yarn which compromises its quality. The condenser components 111 are a disturbing factor on operation of the drafting assembly 101 and may easily get lost due to their relatively small construction.<br>

In Fig. 1 a drafting assembly known from the state of the art, for a ring spinning frame, is shown schematically and provided in its entirety with the reference numeral 100. The drafting assembly 101 is constructed as a so-called three-cylinder drafting assembly which has been known for some time now from the state of the art. This comprises a feed roller pair with a feed press roller 102 and a feed lower roller 103 for a fed sliver F. A middle roller pair with a middle press roller 104 and with a middle lower roller 105 via which double aprons 106 are guided, follows in the transport direction of the sliver F. The path between the feed roller pair 102, 103 and the middle roller pair 104,105 defines a preliminary drafting field 107 for the sliver F. An exit roller pair with an exit press roller 108 and with an exit lower roller 109 is arranged at the exit of the three-cylinder drafting assembly. The path between the middle roller pair 104, 105 and the exit roller pair 108, 109 forms a main drafting field 110 in which the sliver F is drafted to the required fineness.<br>
The drafted sliver F exits the drafting assembly 101 at a nip line A of the exit roller pair 108, 109. This sliver F is twisted with the help of the spin rotation R and is twisted together into the finished yam. At the same time a so-called spinning triangle is formed following the nip line A of the exit roller pair 108, 109 of the drafting assembly<br>
middle press roller 4 and the middle lower roller 5. Double aprons 6 of the main drafting field 10 are guided via the middle roller pair 4, 5. The main drafting field 10 extends from the middle roller pair 4, 5 up to the exit press roller 8 which is supported on a lower cylinder 9. The contact region of the exit press roller 8 with the lower cylinder 9 defines the exit nip line A.<br>
In contrast to the known three-cylinder drafting assemblies, the lower cylinder 9 has a larger diameter that the remaining exit lower rollers. By way of this it is rendered possible to arrange a delivery press roller 15 following the exit press roller 8, said delivery press roller likewise being supported on the lower cylinder 9. The contact region between the delivery press roller 15 and the lower cylinder 9 defines a supply nip line B. The region between the exit press roller 8 and the delivery press roller 15, in particular between the exit nip line A and the supply nip line B, forms a condenser zone 16. A condenser component 11 which is modified .with respect to components of the state of the art, with a condenser channel 12, is arranged in the condenser zone 16. The condenser component 11 on account of its constructional manner acts in a geometric-mechanical manner and compacts the widened sliver F which is led through the condenser channel 12. The condenser component 11 is supported preferably without play on the supply lower cylinder 9 and against the delivery press roller 15. The support surface of the condenser component 11 with respect to the lower cylinder 9 is designed in a manner such mat its radius corresponds largely to that of the supporting lower cylinder 9. By way of this, fibres are prevented from getting between the support surface of the condenser component 11 and the lower cylinder. The longitudinal extension of the support surface with respect to the lower cylinder 9 is dimensioned in a manner such that it ends about 3 mm to 8 mm in front of the supply nip line B. By way of this, the clamping-in of the condenser component 11 between the delivery press roller 15 and the lower cylinder 9 is prevented. The support surface of the condenser component 11 with respect to the delivery press roller 15 is also largely matched to the peripheral surface of the delivery press roller 15. In particular, the support surface at the same time is designed such that the supporting is effected essentially perpendicularly to the plane of the drafting assembly. In the region leading to the nip line, the condenser does not contact the delivery press roller 15. The condenser component 11 is arranged in a manner such that it endures no contact with the exit press roller 8 on normal operation.<br>
The section 13 of the condenser component 11 which is located above the region of the smallest distance between the exit press roller 8 and the delivery press roller 15 is designed in a widened manner. By way of this one succeeds in being able to lift the condenser component 11 together with the delivery press roller 15 from the lower<br>
cylinder 9, for example to allow the yam twisting R to continue into the condenser zone 16 for a short while.<br>
With the condenser zone 16 represented in Fig. 4, the condenser component 21 in its section 23 which extends above the region of the smallest distance between the exit press roller 8 and the delivery press roller 15 is provided with lugs 25 or projections which engage over the end surfaces of the delivery press roller 15 and due to this secure the condenser component 21 axially with only a little play with respect to the delivery press roller 15. The condenser zone 16 again extends from the exit nip line A up to the supply nip line B which are fixed by the contact regions of the respective roller 8 and 15 with the lower cylinder. The sliver is supported along the whole path through the condenser zone 16 by the lower cylinder 9. The condenser channel of the condenser component 21 is provided with the reference numeral 22. It is clearly evident that the condenser channel 22 tapers from the side facing the exit press roller 8 in the direction of the delivery press roller 15.<br>
Fig. 5 shows a view of the concavely curved end face 24 of the condenser component 21, said end face facing the arriving sliver in the operational position. At the end face 24, the condenser channel 22 has a significantly larger cross section that on the opposite exit side. The upper section of the condenser component 21 is again provided with the reference numeral 23. The lugs or projections on the longitudinal sides of the condenser component 21 are indicated at 25. A coloured marking on the lugs 25 or projections may serve as an indicator for the cross section of the condenser channel 22. From this, the user may directly read-off for which yarn region the respective condenser 21 is suitable. The condenser component 21 may consists essentially of plastic, of a ceramic material or of metal, for example of steel or brass. Permanent magnets are indicated with the reference numeral 26, which in operation cooperate with the lower cylinder. By way of this, it is ensured that the condenser component 21 lies snugly on the lower cylinder and may not lift slightly even with oscillations of the machine, and it is ensured than no fibres may get between the condenser component 21 and the peripheral surface of the lower cylinder. Two permanent magnets 26 are indicated in Fig. 5. It is to be understood that only one permanent magnet or also several permanent magnets may be admitted into the condenser component.<br>
Fig. 6 schematically shows a condenser zone 16 with an arcuate transport path for the sliver which extends from the exit nip line A of the exit press roller 8 with the lower cylinder 9 up to the supply nip line B of the delivery press roller 15 with the lower cylinder 9. The drafting zone which is arranged upstream is indicated by the double<br>
aprons 6. The length 1 of the transport path AB at the same time is smaller than the length of roughly a third of the fibres entrained into the sliver. One may also provide for the length 1 of the transport path AB to be changed by way of adjusting the position of the delivery press roller 15. A condenser component 31 is indicated between the two press rollers 8, 15 which are supported on the lower cylinder 9, and the condenser channel 32 of this condenser component is designed open towards the lower cylinder 9. From the representation it is evident that the entry opening of the condenser channel 32 in the vicinity of the exit press roller 8 has a larger cross section than the opening of the condenser channel 32 in the vicinity of the delivery press roller 15. The condenser component 31 is pressed against the peripheral surface of the lower cylinder 9 without play. This is effected either by way of the intrinsic weight of the condenser component 31, by way of a mechanical biasing, for example by way of a loading spring or likewise, or also by way of magnetic attraction between the condenser component 31 and the lower cylinder 9. Combinations of these measures may also be provided.<br>
In order to prevent the fibres from coming between the lower cylinder 9 and the geometrically-mechanically acting condenser component 31 in an uncontrolled manner, it is useful if the lower cylinder 9 has a peripheral surface 91 which is free of interruptions, openings or likewise and is formed largely smoothly. By way of the smooth surface, the condenser component 31 lies in close contact to the peripheral surface 91 and the fibres may only get into the condenser channel 32. The use of a smooth lower cylinder 9 is of no disadvantage for a uniform drafting of the sliver F since the fibres exiting from the drafting zone are clamped twice one after the other. A fibre which at the exit nip line, the exit from the drafting zone has not yet assumed the full peripheral speed of the lower cylinder 9 obtains this at the latest at the supply nip line B, at the exit of the condenser zone 16. The slight tension in the longitudinal direction which is exerted by way of this onto those fibres whose length is greater than the length 1 of the transport path AB through the condenser zone 16 encourages the condensing effect of the condenser component 31 in an advantageous manner.<br>
With a smooth design of the peripheral surface 91 of the lower cylinder 9 it has shown to be advantageous if the peripheral surface 91 of the lower cylinder 9 at least in the region of the course of the sliver F has a high friction value with respect to the fibres. This for example is achieved by way of chemically or electrolytically treating or coating the peripheral surface 91 of the lower cylinder 9 at least in the region of the course of the sliver. For example the peripheral surface 91 of the lower cylinder 9 at least in the region of the course of the sliver F is provided with a nickel-diamond coating. The arrow<br>
indicated at R again indicates the spinning rotation with which the drafted and again condensed sliver F is spun into finished yarn.<br>
Fig. 7 schematically shows a condenser zone 15 which is constructed analogously to the condenser zone of the embodiment example according to Fig. 6. The difference lies in the design of the condenser component 41. This with the shown embodiment example has a condenser channel 42 which is designed open in the direction towards the press rollers 8, 18. Since the sliver F with the represented embodiment example is not directly led over the surface of the lower cylinder 9 but over the base surface 43 of the condenser component 9 lying on the lower cylinder 9, the transport path AB is somewhat longer than would it correspond to the length of the surface section from the exit nip line A to the supply nip line B on the lower cylinder 9.<br>
With the schematic representation in Fig. 8, the condenser component which in its construction corresponds for example to that of Fig. 7 and accordingly has the same reference numeral 41, is connected to a clasp 35 which is resiliency placed onto the lower cylinder 9 and encompasses its peripheral surface 91 by more than 180°. At the same time the clasp 35 only covers in a small part region of the peripheral surface 91. The clasp 35 is co-moved on rotation of the lower cylinder 9 in the direction of the delivery press roller 15. A continuation 33 projecting from the clasp 35 at the same time comes to bear on a stationary component, for example the rotation arbor 17 of the delivery press roller 15, and prevents the condenser component 41 becoming clamped at the supply nip line B. By way of this the condenser component 41 is simultaneously positioned in an exact manner with respect to the supply nip line. The continuation 33 may, as shown, be designed in the manner of a bow; it may however also be a complete plate-like component. The continuation 33 may also project from the condenser component 41.<br>
If the delivery press roller 15 is lifted, the continuation 33 may disengage from the rotation arbor 17 of the delivery press roller 15. In order to prevent in this case the clasp 35 with the connected condenser component 41 from being carried along too far when the lower cylinder is still rotating, a further abutment 34 is provided which comes to bear onto a stationary component. For example this stationary component is a deflection rail 61 for one of the double aprons 6. If the delivery press roller 15 is moved back again, its rotation arbor 17 presses against a bevelled contour of the continuation 33 and moves the clasp 35 with the connected condenser component 41 into the nominal initial position. At the same time the abutment 34 is also moved back from the stationary component 61 by a short path.<br>
The clasp may, as represented, carry only a single condenser component. For reasons of design it is however advantageous if each clasp carries two condenser components which are arranged on both sides of the centrally arranged clasp.<br>
Fig. 9 shows one embodiment example of the invention with which the two press rollers 8, 15 are assembled above the lower cylinder 9 on a common holder 19. The holder 19 accommodates the two rotation arbors 17, 18 of the two press rollers 8, 15. It is loaded by a spring element 63 which is fastened on the holder 19 and is supported against a stationary component for example of the drafting zone, preferably against a press arm 62. It is to be understood that the spring element 63, for example a leaf spring, may also be fastened to the press arm 62 and may be supported against the holder. By way of the central loading of the holder 19, simultaneously both press rollers 8, 15 are pressed against the lower cylinder 9 to the required extent.<br>
Fig. 10 shows a further advantageous variant of the drafting assembly according to the invention. The variant shown by way of example with regard to the construction corresponds to that of the condenser zone 16 according to Fig. 6. For this reason the reference numerals selected there have been kept. With the shown embodiment example in the transport path of the sliver F, additionally a mechanically acting sliver guide 51 is provided. The sliver guide 51 is still located in the drafting zone of the drafting assembly and is arranged following the double apron directly in front of the exit press roller 8. At the same time the sliver guide 51 is aligned onto the condenser component 31 in a manner such that its guide channel 52 runs roughly centrally to the condenser channel 32. The guide channel 52 has an effective width which is smaller that the width of the entry opening into the condenser channel 32. The sliver guide 51 may for example be fastened on the arbor of the exit press roller 8. The sliver guide may be manufactured of plastic, ceramic, a plastic-ceramic mixture or of metal. With the schematically represented embodiment example the sliver guide is represented with a guide channel 52 which is open in the direction of the exit press roller 8. In an alternative design form the guide channel may also be open in the direction of the lower cylinder 9. It is to be understood that the sliver guide 51 may also be applied in combination with a condenser component whose condenser channel is open towards the press rollers.<br>
In one embodiment variant which as not been shown, the sliver guide and the condenser component are displaceable laterally to the fibre transport direction. At the same time the sliver guide and the condenser component are coupled to one another in a manner such mat a lateral displacement may only be effected together. By way of this<br>
the alignment of the guide channel of the sliver guide to the entry into the condenser channel may be maintained even with a lateral displacement.<br>
A ring spinning frame which is provided with a variant of the drafting assembly according to the invention is in the position of providing inexpensive compact yarns whose quality is comparable to that of relatively expensive compact yarns which are produced in the machines of the state of the art.<br>
Already existing drafting assemblies of ring spinning frames of the state of the art may be very simply retrofitted within the context of the invention. For this, a press roller unit is provided which may be assembled in place of an existing exit press roller of a drafting assembly. The press roller unit comprises an exit press roller and a delivery press roller which are assembled on a common holder. A leaf spring or likewise projects from the holder, and this in the assembled condition is supported on a stationary component of the drafting assembly and presses the press roller pair against the lower cylinder of the drafting assembly. For example this component is the press arm which presses the respective upper arranged press rollers of the drafting assembly, in particular of the drafting zone, towards the lower rollers or the lower cylinder. With the press roller unit which is relatively simple with regard to its design, an existing drafting assembly of the state of the art within the context of the invention may be supplemented by a condenser zone arranged downstream.<br>
In a further embodiment variant of the press roller unit, in each case two associated press roller pairs are assembled on the left and right of a centrally arranged holder. The press roller pairs belonging to one another are in each case arranged in pairs and are assembled on the stationary component of the drafting assembly via the holder.<br>
The press roller unit is preferably already equipped with a condenser component which in each case is held in the gap between an associated press roller pair such that it may not get lost. The condenser component at the same tune advantageously has an essentially prismatic body with a roughly triangular cross section. The radii of its support surfaces are largely matched to the radii of the supporting lower cylinder and of the delivery press roller of the drafting assembly. Magnets for fixing the condenser component on the lower cylinder are arranged in the body. For reasons of providing for a lower wear, a more exact machining ability and accuracy, the condenser component preferably consists of a ceramic material or a plastic-ceramic mixture. It may however also be manufactured of plastic or of metal. The condenser component although being held in the press roller unit in a manner such that it may not get lost, may be<br><br>
disassembled when required, in order to renew it or to replace it by another condenser component with the desired width of the condenser channel.<br>
In a further embodiment variant of the invention, the press roller unit also comprises a mechanical sliver guide. The sliver guide is arranged on that side of the exit press roller which lies opposite the gap between the respective press roller pair, in a manner such that it may not get lost. In the assembled condition, the sliver guide is arranged in the drafting zone of the drafting assembly. The sliver guide at the same time has a guide channel for the sliver, which is arranged roughly centrally to the condenser channel of the condenser component and has an effective opening width which is smaller that the width of the condenser channel at the entry into the condenser component. This embodiment variant of the press roller unit contains all components which make up a drafting assembly according to the invention and are required for a uniform an inexpensive manufacture of high quality yams.<br>
With regard to the press roller unit one may also provide for the sliver guide and the condenser component to be arranged in a laterally displaceable manner and when required to be displaceable laterally together. The coupling of the lateral displacement ability of the sliver guide and of the condenser component, when required permits a targeted lateral displacement of the transport part of the sliver through the condenser zone, for example in order to uniformly wear the exit and delivery press rollers and/or the lower cylinder. The press roller unit may be designed for drafting assemblies for short-staple fibres or for long-staple fibres. Whilst with drafting assemblies for long-staple fibres, the diameter of the lower cylinder is generally sufficiently large in order to support the press roller unit, with drafting assemblies for short staple-fibres it may be necessary to exchange the lower cylinder for such with a larger diameter.<br>
With the conversion of existing drafting assemblies, the replacement of the lower cylinder at the exit of the drafting zone may be desirable and it envisaged for the press roller assembly to be offered as a set together with the lower cylinder. At the same time the lower cylinder is advantageously provided with a smooth peripheral surface which at least in the region of the course of the sliver has a high friction value with respect to the fibres. This for example is achieved in that the peripheral surface of the lower cylinder at least in the region of the course of the sliver is treated or coated in a chemical or electrolytic manner. For example the peripheral surface of the lower cylinder at least in the region of the course of the sliver is provided with a nickel-diamond coating. The correspondingly designed lower cylinder may however also be offered as a separate replacement component.<br><br>
The condenser component for the drafting assembly according to the invention may be offered in combination with the press roller unit or as a separate component for a retrofitting or as a replacement part. At the same time the condenser component preferably has an essentially prismatic body with a roughly triangular cross section. The roughly triangular, prismatic design of the body takes into account the shape of the gap between the exit press roller and the delivery press roller. The radii of the support surfaces of the condenser component are largely matched to the radii of the supporting lower cylinder and of the supply press cylinder of the drafting assembly. Magnets for fixing the condenser component on the lower cylinder are arranged in the body of the condenser component. With this, the magnets may project directly from the support surface facing the lower cylinder and form a part of it. The magnets may however also be applied in receiver bores in the vicinity of the support surface. For reasons of wear and on account of its advantageous machining ability and accuracy the condenser component advantageously consists of a ceramic material or a plastic-ceramic mixture.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
