				<td>PRECIPITATION EQUIPMENT<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to electrostatic<br>
precipitation equipment provided with an additional<br>
electrostatic precipitator for enhancing the dust<br>
precipitation performance of the existing equipment.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The precipitation equipment of this type is known<br>
as a precipitator for removing dusts present in boiler<br>
exhaust gas from a thermal power plant or a variety of<br>
iron making furnaces.<br>
There is known in the art an electrostatic<br>
precipitator which is provided with an additional<br>
collector electrode at place downstream of a stationary<br>
collector electrode fixed to place in order to enhance<br>
the dust precipitation performance thereof, the<br>
additional collector electrode shaped like an endless<br>
belt and disposed orthogonal to a gas flow direction.<br>
Such electrostatic precipitators are disclosed in JP-U<br>
No.57(1982)-177550 and JP-A No.2001-321693.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Problems to be Solved by the Invention<br>
JP-U No.57(1982)-177550 discloses an arrangement<br>
wherein the additional collector electrode is mounted<br>
to a gas outlet of the existing electrostatic<br>
 <br>
precipitator. JP-A No.2001-321693 discloses an<br>
arrangement wherein in addition to the above collector<br>
electrode shaped like the endless belt, a collector<br>
electrode made of a steel sheet or the like is added to<br>
the existing electrostatic precipitator.<br>
However, both of the above arrangements are made<br>
such that the additional collector electrode is disposed<br>
in the casing of the existing electrostatic precipitator.<br>
This not only leads to a difficult work to retrofit the<br>
existing equipment with the additional apparatus but<br>
also requires modification to increase the size of the<br>
casing. That is, the above arrangements are not adapted<br>
for large-scale modification.<br>
Fig.1 illustrates an example of ordinary existing<br>
precipitation equipment for boiler exhaust gas treatment<br>
at a thermal power plant. In the precipitation equipment,<br>
a denitrificator 2, an electrostatic precipitator 3, a<br>
desulfurizer 4 and the like are arrayed as large<br>
structures for removal of nitrogen oxides, dusts and<br>
sulfur oxides present in the exhaust gas from a boiler<br>
1. The individual structures are interconnected by an<br>
exhaust air duct 9 through which the exhaust gas flows.<br>
Furthermore, small structures 7 are interposed between<br>
the large structures. The precipitation equipment as a<br>
whole is congested with a variety of structures. In a<br>
 <br>
case where a large-scale plant modification is planned<br>
to add a new electrostatic precipitator for improving<br>
the dust precipitation performance, it is difficult to<br>
install the electrostatic precipitator at place between<br>
the large structures. In addition, the installation of<br>
the electrostatic precipitator on the ground is<br>
obstructed by the small structures.<br>
In view of the above problem in the art, it is an<br>
object of the invention to provide electrostatic<br>
precipitation equipment that facilitates the<br>
installation of an additional apparatus in the existing<br>
equipment including a variety of structures and permits<br>
the installation work to be accomplished in a minimum<br>
shutdown time of the existing equipment.<br>
BREIF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVETION<br>

side of the existing exhaust air duct.<br>
In another aspect of the invention, the<br>
precipitation equipment is characterized in that the<br>
electrostatic precipitator is a moving electrode<br>
electrostatic precipitator including a moving-type<br>
collector electrode, and has a stacked structure built<br>
by stacking carried-in members on the trestle.<br>
In another aspect of the invention, the<br>
precipitation equipment is characterized in that the<br>
inflow duct and outflow duct are located above the<br>
existing exhaust air duct and are connected from above<br>
to the existing exhaust air duct via the inflow<br>
 <br>
connecting duct and the outflow connecting duct,<br>
respectively.<br>
In another aspect of the invention, the<br>
precipitation equipment is characterized in that the<br>
height of the trestle is set to a value to facilitate<br>
tie-in connection between the inflow duct and the<br>
existing exhaust air duct and between the outflow duct<br>
and the existing exhaust air duct.<br>
In another aspect of the invention, the<br>
precipitation equipment is characterized in that the<br>
existing exhaust air duct is provided with a check valve<br>
for blocking the passage of internal exhaust gas in order<br>
to cause the internal exhaust gas to take a roundabout<br>
course through the electrostatic precipitator via the<br>
inflow duct and the outflow duct.<br>
ADVANTAGEOUS EFFECTS OF INVENTION<br>

DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS<br>
Fig. 2 is a schematic diagram illustrating the<br>
overall arrangement of precipitation equipment<br>
according to an embodiment of the invention for removal<br>
of dusts present in a boiler exhaust gas from a thermal<br>
power plant. In the figure, like reference characters<br>
refer to the corresponding components shown in Fig.1.<br>
The embodiment pertains to precipitation equipment<br>
including an electrostatic precipitator 8 newly added<br>
to existing precipitation equipment shown in Fig.l. A<br>
moving electrode electrostatic precipitator featuring<br>
a high dust precipitation function is employed as the<br>
additional electrostatic precipitator, a structure of<br>
which is disclosed in JP-A No.2000-342994, for example.<br>
Referring to Fig.2, the additional electrostatic<br>
precipitator 8 is installed at place between existing<br>
electrostatic precipitator 3 and desulfurizer 4 while<br>
the existing equipment is in operation. The existing<br>
apparatuses 3, 4 are communicatably interconnected by<br>
means of an existing exhaust air duct (flue) 9 having<br>
a rectangular section. In the above arrangement,<br>
however, small structures 7 already exist between the<br>
 <br>
existing apparatuses 3, 4, thus obstructing the<br>
installation of the additional electrostatic<br>
precipitator 8 on an installation space between the<br>
existing apparatuses 3,4. According to this embodiment,<br>
the precipitation equipment includes: a trestle 20<br>
installed in the vicinity of the existing exhaust air<br>
duct 9 and supporting the electrostatic precipitator<br>
thereon at a predetermined height; an inlet duct 8a for<br>
introducing an exhaust gas from an upstream side (on a<br>
side of the electrostatic precipitator 3) of the existing<br>
exhaust air duct 9 into the above electrostatic<br>
precipitator 8; and an outlet duct 9b for returning the<br>
exhaust gas purified by the electrostatic precipitator<br>
8 to a downstream side (on a side of the desulfurizer<br>
4) of the exhaust air duct 9. The additional<br>
electrostatic precipitator 8 for equipment expansion is<br>
installed atop the trestle 20.<br>
Now, an expansion work is described with reference<br>
to Fig.3 to Fig.8. In these figures, like reference<br>
characters refer to the corresponding components shown<br>
in Fig.1 and Fig.2.<br>
In Fig. 3, the trestle 20 has a greater height H than<br>
the small structures 7 already installed on the ground<br>
in order to avoid interference with the small structures.<br>
The trestle 20 is suspended from a crane 210 and carried<br>
 <br>
to place spaced a given distance from a large structure<br>
230. The trestle 20 is installed in a manner to extend<br>
over the small structures 7. The trestle 20 is disposed<br>
at place shifted sideways from the exhaust air duct 9<br>
(shown in section) extending orthogonal to the drawing<br>
surface (Fig.10, S10). Namely, the trestle 20 is<br>
installed at place between the large existing structure<br>
230 and the existing exhaust air duct 9. Subsequently,<br>
a work floor 10 is installed atop the trestle 20. A<br>
drainpipe 30 is connected to the work floor 10 for<br>
draining rain water (Fig.10, S20). Indicated at 220 is<br>
some other member to be carried in by the crane 210.<br>
In Fig. 4, a lower frame 40 is carried in by the crane<br>
210 and installed on the work floor 10 (Fig.10, S30).<br>
Installed in the lower frame 40 is a hopper 50 (S40).<br>
The hopper 50 receives falling dust particles (soot and<br>
dust particles) precipitated and collected from the<br>
exhaust gas by the electrostatic precipitator 8. In<br>
Fig. 5 , the crane 210 installs a main frame 60 on the lower<br>
frame 40 (S50).<br>
Main components of the electrostatic precipitator<br>
are installed in the main frame 60. In Fig. 6, a casing<br>
80 is carried in by the crane 210 and fixed to a periphery<br>
of the main frame (S60). Subsequently, a lower roller<br>
beam 100 and an upper roller beam 90 are fixed to the<br>
 <br>
main frame 60 (S70, S80). Indicated at 70 is a flue<br>
(duct) inlet defined by the casing 80. A flue outlet 71<br>
(not shown in Fig. 6) is provided on an opposite side from<br>
the flue inlet 70.<br>
In Fig.7, discharge electrodes 120 are suspended<br>
from the crane 210 and carried into the casing 80 from<br>
above. The electrodes are suspendedly fixed in the main<br>
frame 60 (S90). Subsequently, moving-type collector<br>
electrodes 110 are suspended from the crane 210 and<br>
carried into the main frame from above. The collector<br>
electrodes are mounted in a manner to surround the<br>
discharge electrodes 120 (S100). Upper rollers 130 and<br>
lower rollers 140 are rotatably mounted to the<br>
corresponding upper roller beam 90 and the lower roller<br>
beam 100. The collector electrodes 110 are entrained<br>
between these upper and lower rollers and driven into<br>
rotation by the rollers for collecting the dust particles<br>
from the exhaust gas based on the principle of<br>
electrostatic precipitation.<br>
The electrostatic precipitator 8 has a stacked<br>
structure built by means of the crane 210 stacking the<br>
carried-in members on the trestle 20 in this manner.<br>
In Fig. 8, stairs 150 for a worker to go up and down<br>
are carried in by the crane 210. The stairs 150 are fixed<br>
to lateral sides of the trestle 20, the lower frame 40<br>
 <br>
and the main frame 60. A stage 160 is mounted atop the<br>
casing 80 to close an upper part of the casing (S110).<br>
The two flue inlets 70 formed at the casing 80 are<br>
connected with respective ends of two inflow flues<br>
(inflow ducts) 180 having a rectangular section (S120).<br>
In this connecting condition, the other end of each<br>
inflow duct 180 is located above (straight above) the<br>
upstream side of the existing exhaust air duct 9.<br>
The two flue (duct) outlets 71 are provided on the<br>
opposite side from the two flue inlets 70. This<br>
connecting condition of the two flues is described with<br>
reference to a plan view of Fig. 9. Fig. 9 also shows a<br>
positional relation between the equipment and the crane<br>
210 performing the installation steps. The casing 80 on<br>
the opposite side from the flue inlets 70 is formed with<br>
the two flue outlets 71, which are connected with<br>
respective ends of two outflow flues (outflow ducts) 181<br>
(S120). In this connecting condition, the other end of<br>
each outflow duct 181 is located above (straight above)<br>
the downstream side of the existing exhaust air duct 9.<br>
Subsequently, the existing precipitation<br>
equipment is shut down (S130). In this shutdown state,<br>
connection portions of the existing exhaust air duct 9<br>
are modified (S140). Specifically, an upper side of an<br>
upstream portion of the existing exhaust air duct 9 is<br>
 <br>
formed with apertures 9a in opposed relation to the other<br>
ends of the respective inflow ducts 180, while an upper<br>
side of a downstream portion of the existing exhaust air<br>
duct 9 is formed with apertures 9b in opposed relation<br>
to the other ends of the respective outflow ducts 181.<br>
Thereafter, a connecting flue (inflow connecting duct)<br>
190 having a height h shown in Fig.8 is mounted to the<br>
aperture 9a, while a connecting flue (outflow connecting<br>
duct) 191 having the height h shown in Fig. 8 is mounted<br>
to the aperture 9b (S150). Further, a check valve 9c is<br>
disposed within the existing exhaust air duct 9<br>
substantially in the middle thereof. The check valve 9c<br>
is mounted to an upper side of the existing exhaust air<br>
duct 9 for blocking a flow of the exhaust gas.<br>
The other end of each of the inflow ducts 180 is<br>
connected to the inflow connecting duct 190 so as to<br>
communicate the inflow duct 180 with the upstream portion<br>
of the existing exhaust air duct 9. The other end of each<br>
of the outflow ducts 181 is connected to an upper end<br>
of the outflow connecting duct 191 so as to communicate<br>
the outflow duct 181 with the downstream portion of the<br>
existing exhaust air duct 9.<br>
When a main body of the additional electrostatic<br>
precipitator 8 is completed by taking the<br>
above-described installation work steps (S160), an<br>
 <br>
operation test for the main body is conducted (S170).<br>
In the operation test, a voltage is applied to the<br>
electrostatic precipitator 8 to determine whether a<br>
predetermined voltage-current characteristic is<br>
obtained or not. If a spark voltage is not high enough,<br>
the electrostatic precipitator is inspected for<br>
inappropriate electrode-to-electrode distance and the<br>
like. A proper measure is implemented, followed by<br>
verification of whether a predetermined performance is<br>
achieved.<br>
After completion of the above test and mechanical<br>
adjustment, the operations of the existing precipitation<br>
equipment and the added electrostatic precipitator 8 are<br>
started (S180).<br>
In operation, the exhaust gas from the existing<br>
electrostatic precipitator 3 flows through the upstream<br>
portion of the existing exhaust air duct 9 and the inflow<br>
duct 180 and into the electrostatic precipitator 8.<br>
After purification in the electrostatic precipitator 8,<br>
the exhaust gas flows through the outflow duct 181 and<br>
into the downstream portion of the existing exhaust air<br>
duct 9. Specifically, the exhaust gas discharged from<br>
the existing electrostatic precipitator 3 does not flows<br>
directly into the existing desulfurizer 4 but takes a<br>
roundabout course through the added electrostatic<br>
 <br>
precipitator 8 and into the existing desulfurizer 4.<br>
Accordingly, dust particles are collected from the<br>
exhaust gas in two steps using the existing electrostatic<br>
precipitator 3 and. the added electrostatic precipitator<br>
8. The precipitation equipment removes dusts from the<br>
exhaust gas with high dust precipitation performance.<br>
The existing equipment takes only a short shutdown<br>
time because the shutdown time is a period between the<br>
modification of the existing exhaust air duct 9 for<br>
forming the connecting portions and the connection of<br>
the inflow ducts and the outflow ducts.<br>
The connecting duct 190 and the connecting duct 191<br>
are interposed in a tie-in distance between the inflow<br>
duct 180 and the existing exhaust air duct 9 and a tie-in<br>
distance between the outflow duct 181 and the existing<br>
exhaust air duct 9, respectively. If either or both of<br>
the distances are subject to any dimensional error during<br>
assembly, adjustment is made by changing the height h<br>
of either one or both of the connecting duct 190 and the<br>
connecting duct 191. The height H of the trestle 20 is<br>
adjusted according to the height of the additional<br>
electrostatic precipitator 8 such that the tie-in<br>
distance between the inflow duct 180 and the existing<br>
exhaust air duct 9 and the tie-in distance between the<br>
outflow duct 181 and the existing exhaust air duct 9 may<br>
 <br>
be substantially equal to the height h (to facilitate<br>
tie-in connection between the ducts).<br>
In the above-described installation steps, the<br>
individual members are carried in by the crane 210 which<br>
lifts them up, and moves and lifts them down to required<br>
places. The assembly work can be smoothly carried out<br>
because the installation steps are adapted to the<br>
assembly work in which the additional electrostatic<br>
precipitator is built by sequentially stacking the<br>
components thereof on the trestle 20 first installed at<br>
place. Further, the inflow duct 180 and the outflow duct<br>
181 are carried in and placed above the existing exhaust<br>
air duct 9 so that the inflow duct and the outflow duct<br>
may approach from above to be connected to the existing<br>
exhaust air duct 9 via the inflow connecting duct 190<br>
and the outflow connecting duct 191, respectively.<br>
Therefore, the crane 210 can accomplish the assembly work<br>
efficiently.<br>
