As indicated above, all of the compounds of formula I, and their corresponding pharmaceutlcally acceptable acid addition salts, are useful in inhibiting DPP-IV. The abtiil of the compounds of formula t, and their corresponding pharmaceutlcally acceptable acid addition salts, to inhibit DPP-IV may be demonstrated employing the Caco-2 DPP-(V Ass£ which measures the ability of test compounds to inhibit DPP-IV activity from human coloni carcinoma cell extracts. The human colonic carcinoma cell line Caco-2 was obtained fron the American Type Culture Collection {ATCC HTB 37). Differentiation of the cells to lndu( npp-iu PYnrflRsion was accomolished as described bv Reisher. et al. in an article entitled<br><br>
Caco-2 protein, diluted to a final volume of 125 pi in assay buffer (25 mM Tris HCI pH 7.4 140mfw1 NaCI, 10 mM KCI, 1 % bovine serum albumin) to microliter plate wells. After a 60 min. incubation at room temperature, the reaction is initiated by adding 25pl of 1 mM substrate (H-AIanine-Proiine-pNA; pNA is p-nitroaniline). The reaction is canied out at roi temperature for 10 minutes after which time a 19 pi volume of 25% glacial acetic acid Is added to stop the reaction. Test compounds are typically added as 30 p) additions and tF assay buffer volume is reduced to 95 pi. A standard curve of free p-nitroaniline is generated using 0-500 pM solutions of free pNA in assay buffer. The curve generated is linear and is used for interpolation of substrate consumption (catalytic activity in nmoles substrate cleaved /min). The endpoint is detemined by measuring absorbanco at 405 nr in a Molecular Devices UV Max microtiter plate reader.<br>
The potency of the test compounds as DPP-iV inhibitors, expressed as ICso, Is calculated from 8-point, dose-response curves using a 4-parameter logistic function.<br>
The following IC50 was obtained:<br><br>
The ability of the compounds of formula I, and their con-esponding phamiaceutical acceptable acid addition salts, to inhibit DPP-IV may also be demonstrated by measuring the effects of test compounds on DPP-IV activity in human and rat plasma employing a modified version of the assay described by Kubota, et al. in an article entitled "Involvemei of dipeptidylpeptidase IV in an in vivo immune response" in Clin. Exp. Immunol., Vol. 89, pgs. 192-197 (1992). Briefly, 5 pi of plasma are added to 96-well flat-bottom microtiter plates (Falcon), followed by the addition of 5 pi of 80 mM MgCl2 in incubation buffer (25 mMHEPES, 140 mM NaCI, 1% RIA-grade BSA, pH 7.8). After a 60 min. incubation at rot<br><br>
typically added as 2 |jl additions and the assay buffer volume is reduced to 13 |jl. A fluorescence-concentration curve of free AMC is generated using 0-50 \xM solutions of Al in assay buffer. Tiie curve generated is linear and is used for interpolation of substrate consumption {catalytic activity in nmoles substrate cleaved/min). As with the previous assay, the potency of the test compounds as DPP-IV intiibitors, expressed as IC50, is calculated from 8-point, dose-response curves using a 4 parameter logistic function.<br>
The following IC50 was obtained:<br><br>
In view of their ability to inhibit DPP-IV, the compounds of formula I, and their corresponding pharmaceutlcally acceptable acid addition salts, are useful in treating conditions mediated by DPP-IV inhibition. Based on the above and findings in the literati it is expected that the compounds disclosed herein are useful in the treatment of conditio such as non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, arthritis, obesity, allograft transplantatic and calcitonin-osteoporosis. In addition, based on the roles of glucagon-like peptides (si as GLP-1 and GLP-2) and their association with DPP-IV inhibition, it is expected that the compounds disclosed herein are useful for example, to produce a sedative or anxiolytic effect, or to attenuate post-surgical catabolic changes and homnonal responses to stress to reduce mortality and morbidity after myocardial Infarction.or in the treatment of conditf( related to the above effects which may be mediated by GLP-1 and/or GLP-2 levels.<br>
More specifically, for example, the compounds of fomiula 1, and their correspondii pharmaceutlcally acceptable acid addition salts, improve early insulin response to an oral glucose challenge and, therefore, are useful in treating non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. The ability of the compounds of fom^ula I, and their corresponding pharmaceutlcally acceptable acid addition salts, to improve early insulin response to an c<br><br>
into groups of 8-10, and dosed orally with 10 pmol/kg of the test compounds in CMC. An oral glucose bolus of 1 g/kg was administered 30 minutes after the test compound directl into the stomach of the test animals. Blood samples, obtained at various timepoints from chronic jugular vein catheters, were analyzed for plasma glucose and immunoreactive insulin (IRt) concentrations, and plasma DPP-IV activity. Plasma insulin fevefs were assayed by a double antibody radioimmunoassay (RIA) method using a specific anti-rat Insulin antibody from Unco Research (St. Louis, MO). The RIA has a lower limit of detection of 0.5 pU/mL with Intra- and inter-assay variations of less than 5%. Data are expressed as % increase of the mean of the control animals. Upon oral administration, each of the compounds tested amplified the early insulin response which led to an improvement in glucose tolerance in the insulin resistant test animals. T?ie following rest were obtained:<br><br>
The precise dosage of the compounds of formula I, and their corresponding pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts, to be employed for treating conditions mediated by DPP-IV inhibition depends upon several factors, including the host, the natu and the severity of the condition being treated, the mode of administration and the partict compound employed. However, in general, conditions mediated by DPP-IV inhibition are effectively treated when a compound of formula I, or a con-esponding pharmaceuttcaliy acceptable acid addition salt, is administered enterally, e.g., orally, or parenteralty, e.g., intravenously, preferably orally, at a daily dosage of 0.002-5, preferably 0.02-2.5 mg/kg body weight or, for most larger primates, a daily dosage of 0.1-250, preferably 1-100 mg. typical oral dosage unit Is 0.01 -0.75 mg/kg, one to three times a day. Usually, a small do is administered initially and the dosage is gradually increased until the optimal dosage foi<br><br>
and, optionally, one or more other conventional pharmaceutical adjuvants and administer enterally, e.g., orally, in the form of tablets, capsules, caplets, etc. or parenterally, e.g., intravenously, in the form of sterile injectable solutions or suspensions. The enteral and parenteral compositions may be prepared by conventional means.<br>
The compounds of formula I, and their corresponding phamiaceuticalfy acceptabit acid addition salts, may be fomiuiated into enteral and parenteral phamiaceutical compositions containing an amount of the active substance that is effective for treating conditions mediated by DPP-IV inhibition, such compositions in unit dosage fonri and sue compositions comprising a phamiaceuticaily acceptable carrier.<br>
The compounds of formula I (including those of each of the subscopes thereof an each of the examples) may be administered in enantiomerically pure fomi (e.g., ee &gt;98% preferably &gt;99%) or together with the B enantiomer, e.g., in racemic fom. The above dosage ranges are based on the compounds of formula I (excluding the amount of the B enantiomer).<br>

upon adamantylamine hydrochloride addition, slight bubbling occurs and the reaction is slightly exothermic. This bubbling, yellow solution is stin^ed at ice-water temperature for about 2 hours and then at room temperature for 30 houre. This clear, light yellow reactioi then poured into about 10Og of ice and the resulting solution is clear green-blue.<br>
The solution is placed in an ice-water Path and allowed to stir for 30 minutes. Approximately 550g of 89% pure KOH (8,74 mol) is then added In small portions over 45 minutes. During this addition, the reaction is exothemiic; reaching SOX and producing copious amounts of brown N02 gas. By the end of the addition, the reaction is thick with white solids (both product and salts). The resulting white paste is then poured onto a buchner funnel/celite pad and washed with 1.2 L of CH2CI2. The CH2CI2 layer is ttien extracted from the water layer and dried over Na2S04.

The procedure to make 3-ethoxv-1 -adamantvlamJne (a clear oil) is the same as for methoxy-1-adamantylamine except that iodoethane (1.3 equivalent) is used instead of iodomethane.<br>
Fonnulation Example:<br>
Tablets, each containing 50 mg of active ingredient, for example, (S)1-[(3-hydroxy-1-adamantyl)amino]acetyl-2-cyano-pyn"olidine, can be prepared as fo/lowfs;<br><br>
