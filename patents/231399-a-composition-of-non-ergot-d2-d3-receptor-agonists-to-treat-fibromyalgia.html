				<td>A COMPOSITION OF NON-ERGOT D2/D3 RECEPTOR AGONISTS<br>
TO TREAT FIBROMYALGIA.<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a composition of non-ergot D2/D3 receptor agonists to<br>
treat fibromyalgia, and, in particular, to methods for the treatment of fibromyalgia<br>
using non-ergot dopamine D2/D3.agonists. More specifically, tetrahydro-<br>
benzthiazoles, in particular, 2-amino-6-n-propylamino-4,5,6,7-tetralrobenzo-<br>
thiazole or the (-)-enantiomers thereof, and certain 3(H)-indolone derivatives, in<br>
particular, 4-[2-(dipropylamino)-ethyl]-l,3-dihydro-2H-indol-2-one, and the<br>
pharmacologically acceptable salts thereof, alone or in association with a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable earner, can be used to treat fibromyalgia patients.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Fibromyalgia is a common disabling disorder characterized by chronic<br>
musculoskeletal aches and pain, stiffness, general fatigue, and sleep abnormalities<br>
including diminished stage four sleep. Fibromyalgia is a chronic, painful disorder<br>
commonly seen in rheumatology practice and is often viewed as a musculoskeletal<br>
pain process. Fibromyalgia is characterized as a reproducible, neurosensory<br>
processing abnormality associated with fatigue, and generalized muscular spasm,<br>
which most rheumatologists suspect is related to stage IV sleep deprivation.<br>
Examination of affected patients reveals increased tenderness at muscle and tendon<br>
insertion sites, known as "tender points". Fibromyalgia patients experience severe<br>
morning stiffness and a generalized decreased of overall physical function, and they<br>
are often prone to headaches, memory and concentration problems, dizziness,<br>
numbness and tingling, and crampy abdominal or pelvic pain. Fibromyalgia affects<br><br>
2-4% of the population and is most frequently found in women between 20 and 50<br>
years old, though it can also affect men, the elderly and minors.<br>
Diagnosis of fibromyalgia is often overlooked due to the general nature of the<br>
symptoms and the lack of diagnostic lab or x-ray abnormalities. The disorder is often<br>
concomitant with, masked by or confused with other diseases such as rheumatoid<br>
arthritis, chronic fatigue syndrome or irritable bowl syndrome. A physician car<br>
positively diagnose fibromyalgia syndrome by finding the symptoms of generalized<br>
musculoskeletal pain and pain at more than 11of 18 defined characteristic "tender<br>
points" when finger pressure of about 4 kg is applied to the area. The total pain score<br>
for all 18 tender points is referred to as the "tender point index" of that patient. The<br>
efficacy of a particular fibromyalgia therapy is demonstrated by a observation of a<br>
statistically significant improvement in a patient's tender point index.<br>
The etiology of fibromyalgia is not known but consideration has been given<br>
to genetic, traumatic, affective, and infectious processes as possibilities. Currently<br>
the best treatment available for fibromyalgia consists of a combination of analgesics,<br>
sleep aids, exercise programs emphasizing stretching and. cardiovascular fitness,<br>
relaxation techniques and other measures to reduce muscle tension, and educational<br>
and psychological support programs to reduce emotional and physical stress; the<br>
resulting benefits are usually disappointing. Numerous pharmaceutical regimes have<br>
been tried including treatment with serotonin modulators and antisera to endogenous<br>
psychoactive agents. Therapeutic response can be assessed by the reduction of pain<br>
in the tender point index and improvement in several generalized criteria such as<br>
physical function, stiffness, fatigue, depression, tenseness, etc. Responses to these<br>
various therapies have proven variable within a patient pool and have rarely exceeded<br>
modest relief of some symptoms.<br>
For example, Hitzig (U.S. Patent No. 5,658,955) discloses the treatment of a<br>
broad range of immune disorders, including fibromyalgia, with an effective amount<br>
of a serotonin agonist and a dopamine agonist. The preferred dopamine agonist<br>
discussed in Hitzig is phentermine which is an adrenergic compound. Further, none<br>
of the dopamine agonists cited in Hitzig are non-ergot dopamine receptor D2/D3<br>
agonists. Hitzig also includes no data in support of their statement that fibromyalgia<br>
can be treated with a serotonin agonist and a dopamine agonist. Also, fibromyalgia<br>
is no longer thought of as an autoimmune disorder, indeed the clinical name<br>
associated with the disease was changed from fibrositis to fibromyalgia to<br>
specifically remove any connotation of an immune or inflammatory condition.<br><br>
Cincotta etal. (U.S. Patent Nos. 5,905,083, 5,872,133, 5,872,127, and<br>
5,696,128) also discloses the use of a serotonin agonist and a dopamine agonist at<br>
particular times of the day to treat a wide variety of immune disorders. More<br>
specifically they suggest mat a variety of immune disorders can be treated by<br>
providing patients with an amount of the serotonin and dopamine agonists sufficient<br>
to adjust the prolactin profile of the patient. The Cincotta etal. patents list<br>
fibromyalgia as one of the many immune disorders that can be treated by prolactin<br>
management. However, other clinical studies have not validated the association<br>
between prolactin and fibromyalgia (Alder etal., Am. J. Med. 106:534-543 (1999);<br>
Griep et al., J. Rheumatol. 21:2125-2130 (1994)).<br>
U.S. Patent Serial No. 6,036,949 discloses that low doses of interferon can be<br>
used to treat fibromyalgia. However, the clinical study disclosed in the patent<br>
showed only a modest improvement in the severity of morning stiffness, one of the<br>
secondary symptoms of fibromyalgia. The pressure point pain index for<br>
fibromyalgia patients receiving interferon did not show any statistically significant<br>
improvement relative to a placebo group.<br>
In the past, there was a tendency to view fibromyalgia as a benign disorder<br>
which did not justify aggressive therapy which might carry with it any risk of adverse<br>
experience. However, that philosophy can no longer be justified considering the<br>
impact of this condition on the quality of life of affected individuals. Considering<br>
that the annual direct cost of fibromyalgia to the United States economy is estimated<br>
at $16 billion, there exists a significant need for more effective therapy for patients<br>
afflicted with fibromyalgia.<br>
The tetrahydro-benzthiazoles useful in the present invention, are dopamine-<br>
D2/D3 agonists the syntheses of which are described in European Patent 186 087 and<br>
its counterparts, U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,843,086 and 4,886,812. These compounds are<br>
known primarily for the treatment of schizophrenia and Parkinson's disease. It is<br>
known from German patent application DE 38 43 227 that 2-amino-6-n-<br>
propylamino-4,5,6,7-tetrahydrobenzo-thiazole (pramipexole) can be used in the<br>
treatment of drug dependency. Further, it is known from German patent application<br>
DE 39 33 738 that pramipexole can be used to decrease abnormal high levels of<br>
thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). U.S. Pat. No. 5,112,842 discloses the<br>
transdermal administration of the compounds and transdermal systems containing<br>
these active compounds. The WO patent application PCT/EP 93/03389 describes<br>
pramipexole as an antidepressant agent, while U.S. Pat. No. 5,650,420 discloses the<br><br>
neuroprotective effects of pramipexole. U.S. Pat. No. 6,001,861 discloses the use of<br>
pramipexole in the treatment of restless legs syndrome.<br>
Similarly, the indolone compounds, useful in the present invention, are also<br>
dopamine receptor D2/D3 agonists, the syntheses of which are described in U.S. Pat.<br>
No. 4,452,808. U.S. Pat Nos. 4,912,126 and 4,824,860 further disclose that these<br>
indolone compounds, in particular, 4-[2-(dipropyIamino)-ethyl]-l,3-dihydro-2H-<br>
indol-2-one, can be used to treat Parkinson's disease.<br>
Dopamine receptor D2/D3 agonists have been reported as not being capable<br>
of producing the central behavioral effects often seen with other classes of dopamine<br>
agonists (see Gallagher etal., J. Med. Chem. 28:1533-1536 (1985)). Furthermore, it<br>
has been reported that D2/D3 agonists show minimal liability to cause dyskinesia.<br>
Dyskinesia is a common problem associated with postsynaptic dopamine agonists,<br>
for example ergo alkaloids such as bromocriptine.<br>
The present invention is directed to a method for treating the disease<br>
condition (as measured by reduction of clinical symptoms) by treating a fibromyalgia<br>
afflicted patient with a non-ergot dopamine receptor D2/D3 agonist and the<br>
pharmacologically acceptable salts thereof.<br>

ethyl]-l,3-dihydro-2H-indol-2-one or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.<br>
Suitable salts will be apparent to those skilled in the art and include, for example acid<br>
addition salts, preferably the hydrochloride.<br>
The synthesis, formulation and administration of the tetrahydro-benzthiazole<br>
compounds of formula (I) that are used in the practice of the present invention are<br>
described in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,843,086; 4,886,812; 5,112,842; 5,650,420 and<br>
6,001,861, which are incorporated by reference herein. The compounds of general<br>
formula (I) have at least one chiral center and can, therefore, exist in the form of<br>
various stereoisomers. The invention embraces all of these stereoisomers and<br>
mixtures thereof. Mixtures of these stereoisomers can be resolved by conventional<br>
methods, e.g. by column chromatography on a chiral phase, by fractional<br>
crystallization of the diastereomeric salts or by column chromatography of their<br>
conjugates with optically active auxiliary acids such as tartaric acid, 0,0-dibenzoyl-<br>
tartaric acid, camphor acid, camphorsulfonic acid or a-methoxy-phenylacetic acid.<br><br>
The synthesis, formulation and administration of the 3(H)-indolone<br>
compounds of formula (II) above that are used in the practice of the present invention<br>
is described in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,452,808.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) and (II) may also be converted into the acid<br>
addition salts thereof, particularly the pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts<br>
with inorganic or organic acids. Suitable acids for this include, for example,<br>
hydrochloric, hydrobromic, sulfuric, phosphoric, lactic, citric, tartaric, succinic,<br>
maleic or fumaric acid.<br>
hi another aspect of the invention, a patient is first determined to be suffering<br>
from fibromyalgia based upon the occurrence of musculoskeletal pain symptoms, and<br>
then the patient is treated by administering an effective amount of a dopamine D2/D3<br>
receptor agonist, preferably, one of the compounds of general formula (I) and (II) to<br>
modulate the pain symptoms of fibromyalgia, as set forth herein.<br>
A physician can positively diagnosis fibromyalgia by finding the symptoms<br>
of generalized musculoskeletal pain at more than 11 of 18 defined characteristic<br>
"tender points" when finger pressure of about 4 kg is applied to the area, which test is<br>
known as the "tender point index". As used herein the term "musculoskeletal pain"<br>
refers to pain associated with one or more of the 18 defined "tender points"<br>
commonly surveyed in the diagnosis of fibromyalgia. The "tender points" survey is<br>
well known in the art, see for example, Wolfe et al.(Arthritis and Rheumatism,<br>
33:160-172,1990).<br>
The tetrahydro-benzthiazole compounds of formula (I), (la) and (lb),<br>
particularly the (-)-entantiomers thereof, and 3(H)-indolones of formula (II) and<br>
pharmacologically acceptable acid addition salts thereof, alone or in combination<br>
with a pharmaceutical carrier can be used to treat fibromyalgia. The form of<br>
conventional galenic preparations consist essentially of an inert pharmaceutical<br>
carrier and an effective dose of the active substance; e.g., plain or coated tablets,<br>
capsules, lozenges, powders, solutions, suspensions, emulsions, syrups,<br>
suppositories, inhaler, transdermal patches etc.<br>
The term "effective amount" as used herein means an amount of a compound<br>
of the invention effective to result in the clinically determinable improvement in or<br>
suppression of symptoms of fibromyalgia, such as musculoskeletal pain. An<br>
improvement in such symptoms includes both a reduction in intensity and frequency<br>
of musculoskeletal pain and a complete cessation of musculoskeletal pain for a<br>
sustained period. Typically effective amounts of the compounds of the invention will<br><br>
generally range from about 0.1 mg/day to about 50 mg/day, more preferably about<br>
0.25 mg/day to about 40 mg/day and most preferably about 0.5 mg/day to about 20<br>
mg/day.<br>
More preferably, the patient is administered an effective amount of 2-amino-<br>
6-n-propylamino-4,5,6,7-tetrahydrobenzo-thiazole or the (-)-enantiomers thereof, and<br>
the pharmacologically acceptable salts thereof, alone or in association with a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Alternatively, the patient is administered an<br>
effective amount of 4-[2-(dipropylamino)-ethyl]-l,3-dihydro-2H-indol-2-one and the<br>
pharmacologically acceptable salts thereof, alone or in association with a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.<br>
In a presently particularly preferred embodiment of the invention, a patient<br>
suffering from fibromyalgia is administered pramipexole which is a particular<br>
pharmaceutical	formulation	of	(5)-2-amino-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-6-<br>
(propylamino)benzo-thiazole dihydrochloride monohydrate available from<br>
Pharmacia &amp; Upjohn under the trademark MIRAPEX® (Physicians' Desk Reference,<br>
53rd edition, 2497-2501, 1999, Medical Economics Co., Inc. Montvale, NJ).<br>
In a second particularly preferred embodiment of the invention, a patient<br>
suffering from fibromyalgia is administered ropinirole which is a particular<br>
pharmaceutical formulation of 4-[2-(dipropylamino)-ethyl]-l,3-dihydro-2H-indol-2-<br>
one available from Smith Kline Beecham under the trademark Requip® (Physicians'<br>
Desk Reference, 53rd edition, 3087-3092, 1999, Medical Economics Co., Inc.<br>
Montvale, NJ).<br>
The compounds of the present invention can be used in the form of salts<br>
derived from inorganic or organic acids. These salts include but are not limited to<br>
the following: acetate, adipate, alginate, citrate, aspartate, benzoate,<br>
benzenesulfonate, bisulfate, butyrate, camphorate, camphorsulfonate, digluconate,<br>
cyclopentanepropionate, dodecylsulfate, ethanesulfonate, glucoheptanoate,<br>
glycerophosphate, hemisulfate, heptanoate, hexanoate, fumarate, hydrochloride,<br>
hydrobromide, hydroiodide, 2-hydroxyethanesulfonate, lactate, maleate,<br>
methanesulfonate, nicotinate, 2-napthalenesulfonate, oxalate, pamoate, pectinate,<br>
persulfate, 3-phenylproionate, picrate, pivalate, propionate, succinate, tartrate,<br>
thiocyanate, p-toluenesulfonate and undecanoate. Also, the basic nitrogen-containing<br>
groups can be quaternized with such agents as loweralkyl halides, such as methyl,<br>
ethyl, propyl, and butyl chloride, bromides, and iodides; dialkyl sulfates like<br>
dimethyl, diethyl, dibutyl, and diamyl sulfates, long chain halides such as decyl,<br><br>
lauryl, myristyl and stearyl chlorides, bromides and iodides, aralkyl halides like<br>
benzyl and phenethyl bromides, and others. Water or oil-soluble or dispersible<br>
products are thereby obtained.<br>
Examples of acids which may be employed to form pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable acid addition salts include such inorganic acids as hydrochloric acid,<br>
sulphuric acid and phosphoric acid and such organic acids as oxalic acid, maleic acid,<br>
succinic acid and citric acid. Basic addition salts can be prepared in situ during the<br>
final isolation and purification of the compounds of formula (I) and (II), or separately<br>
by reacting carboxylic acid moieties with a suitable base such as the hydroxide,<br>
carbonate or bicarbonate of a pharmaceutical acceptable metal cation or with<br>
ammonia, or an organic primary, secondary or tertiary amine. Pharmaceutical<br>
acceptable salts include, but are not limited to, cations based on the alkali and<br>
alkaline earth metals, such as sodium, lithium, potassium, calcium, magnesium,<br>
aluminum salts and the like, as well as nontoxic ammonium, quaternary ammonium,<br>
and amine cations, including, but not limited to ammonium, tetramethylammonium,<br>
tetraethylammonium, methylamine, dimethylamine, trimethylamine, triethylamine,<br>
ethylamine, and the like. Other representative organic amines useful for the<br>
formation of base addition salts include diethylamine, ethylenediamine,<br>
ethanolamine, diethanolamine, piperazine and the like.<br>
The compounds may be used alone or in compositions together with a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. In addition, the dopamine agonist used in the<br>
practice of the present invention can be used in combination with a variety of other<br>
pharmaceutical compositions. For example, in the practice of the inventive<br>
fibromyalgia treatment method it is common to use the dopamine agonists in<br>
combination with Ativan® (Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories (Philadelphia, PA), an<br>
antianxiety agent, or Klonopin® (Roche Laboratories, Nutley, NJ), an antipanic<br>
agent, to control sympathetic tone, and to add an option for stage III/IV sleep control<br>
such as Trazodone, a muscle relaxant or melatonin. Initially, many fibromyalgia<br>
patients are undergoing treatment with Sinemet®, which is commonly used to treat<br>
fibromyalgia. Patients are counseled to discontinue Sinemet®, and to decrease any<br>
somnolent medications as the dopamine receptor D2/D3 agonist treatment regime<br>
become effective.<br>
Patients are initially treated with the dopamine receptor D2/D3 agonist at the<br>
low end of the recommended dose, for example, in the case of pramipexole (2-<br>
amino-6-n-propylamino-4,5,6,7 tetrahydrobenzothiozole) a dose of about 0.125 mg<br><br>
once per day at bedtime (qhs), and in the case of ropinirole (4-[2-(dipropylamino)-<br>
ethyl]-1,3-dihydro-2H-indol-2-one)3 a patient starts at 0.25 mg qhs.<br>
The standard dose regime for treatment of fibromyalgia with the dopamine<br>
receptor D2/D3 agonists then involves increasing the amount of agonists gradually on<br>
a weekly basis until the patient exhibits an therapeutic effect or intolerance (see<br>
Table 1). Alternatively, if desired, a more rapid dosage regime may also be used (see<br>
Table 1).<br><br><br>
In the case of pramipexole, the effective dose is usually between about 0.125<br>
mg qhs to about 15.0 mg qhs. More usually, the effective dose is between about 0.25<br>
mg qhs and about 6.0 mg qhs. When using ropinirole, the effective dose is usually<br>
between about 0.75 mg qhs to about 30.0 mg qhs. More usually, the effective dose is<br>
between about 1.5 mg qhs and about 20.0 mg qhs. In either case the daily dose can<br>
be divided into multiple dosages forms administered two or more times per day if<br>
desirable.<br>
It will be understood, however, that the specific dose level for any particular<br>
patient will depend upon a variety of factors including the activity of the specific<br>
compound employed, the age, body weight, general health, sex, diet, time of<br>
administration, route of administration, rate of excretion, drug combination, and the<br>
severity of fibromyalgia. In general the dosage of a compound of the present<br>
invention should be increased gradually from a starting dose of about 0.125 mg of<br>
compound per day and then increased every 5-7 days to a maximum dose per day of<br>
about 30.0 mg of compound per day. Providing patients do not experience<br>
intolerable side effects, the dosage should be titrated to achieve a maximal<br>
therapeutic effect. The exact optimal dosage for treatment of fibromyalgia with each<br>
of the dopamineD2/D3 agonist compounds will vary depending upon which agonist<br>
is being used. Further, the determination of an optimal dopamine D2/D3 agonist<br>
dosage requires only routine testing regimes similar to those disclosed herein.<br>
The compounds of the present invention may be administered orally,<br>
parenterally, sublingually, by inhalation spray, rectally, or topically in dosage unit<br>
formulations containing conventional nontoxic pharmaceutically acceptable carriers,<br>
adjuvants, and vehicles as desired. Topical administration may also involve the use<br>
of transdermal administration such as transdermal patches or ionophoresis devices.<br>
The term parenteral as used herein includes subcutaneous injections, intravenous,<br>
intramuscular, intrastemal injection, or infusion techniques.<br>
Injectable preparations, for example, sterile injectable aqueous or oleagenous<br>
suspensions may be formulated according to the known art using suitable dispersing<br>
or wetting agents and suspending agents. The sterile injectable preparation may also<br>
be a sterile injectable solution or suspension in a nontoxic parenterally acceptable<br>
diluent or solvent, for example, as a solution in 1/3-propanediol. Among the<br>
acceptable vehicles and solvents that may be employed are water, Ringer's solution,<br>
and isotonic sodium chloride solution. In addition, sterile, fixed oils are<br>
conventionally employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose any<br><br>
bland fixed oil may be employed including synthetic mono- or di-glycerides. In<br>
addition, fatty acids such as oleic acid find use in the preparation of injectables.<br>
Suppositories for rectal administration of the drug can be prepared by mixing<br>
the drug with a suitable nonirritating excipient such as cocoa butter and polyethylene<br>
glycols which are solid at ordinary temperatures but liquid at the rectal temperature<br>
and will therefore melt in the rectum and release the drug.<br>
Because of their ease in administration, tablets and capsules represent the<br>
most advantageous oral dosage unit form, in which case solid pharmaceutical carriers<br>
are obviously employed. Solid dosage forms for oral administration may include<br>
capsules, tablets, pills, powders, and granules. In such solid dosage forms, the active<br>
compound may be admixed with at least one inert diluent such as sucrose lactose or<br>
starch. Such dosage forms may also comprise, as is normal practice, additional<br>
substances other than inert diluents, e.g., diluents, granulating agents, lubricants,<br>
binders, disintegrating agents and the like. In the case of capsules, tablets, and pills,<br>
the dosage forms may also comprise buffering agents. Tablets and pills, can<br>
additionally be prepared with sugar or enteric coatings, as is known in the art.<br>
2-Amino-6-n-propylamino-4,5,6,7-tetrahydrobenzo-thiazole is currently<br>
available from Phaimacia &amp; Upjohn under the trademark MIRAPEX® in a tablet<br>
form for oral administration in tablets containing 0.125 mg, 0.25 mg, 1.0 mg,<br>
1.25 mg or 1.5 mg of (S)-2-amino-4,5,6,7-te1xahydro-6-(propylamino)benzo-thiazole<br>
dihydrochloride monohydrate. The tablets contain the following inactive ingredients:<br>
lactose hydrous, pregelatinized starch, microcrystalline cellulose, sodium starch<br>
glycolate, magnesium stearate, purified water, camauba wax, hydroxypropyl<br>
methylcellulose, titanium dioxide, polyethylene glycol, synthetic iron oxide, and<br>
polysorbate 80.<br>
4-[2-(dipropylamino)-ethyl]-1,3-dihydro-2H-indol-2-one mono hydrochloride<br>
is currently available from Smith Kline Beecham under the trademark Requip® in a<br>
tablet form for oral administration in tablets containing 0.25 mg, 0.5 mg, 1.0 mg or<br>
2.0 mg or 5.0 mg of 4-[2-(dipropylamino)-ethyl]-l,3,dihydro-2H-indole-2-one<br>
monohydrochloride. The tablets contain the following inactive ingredients:<br>
croscarmellose sodium, hydrous lactose, magnesium stearate microcrystalline<br>
cellulose, and one or more of the following: FD&amp;C Blue No.2 aluminum lake,<br>
hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, iron oxides, polyethylene glycol, polysorbate 80,<br>
talc, and titanium dioxide.<br><br>
Liquid dosage forms for oral administration may include pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable emulsions, solutions, suspensions, syrups, and elixirs containing inert<br>
diluents commonly used in the art, such as water. Such compositions may also<br>
comprise adjuvants, such as wetting agents, emulsifying and suspending agents, and<br>
sweetening, flavoring, and perfuming agents.<br>
The compounds of the present invention can also be administered in the form<br>
of liposomes. As is known in the art, liposomes are generally derived from<br>
phospholipids or other lipid substances. Liposomes are formed by mono- or multi-<br>
lamellar hydrated liquid crystals that are dispersed in an aqueous medium. Any non-<br>
toxic, physiologically acceptable and metabolizable lipid capable of forming<br>
liposomes can be used. The present compositions in liposome form can contain, in<br>
addition a compound of the present invention, stabilizers, preservatives, excipients,<br>
and the like. The preferred lipids are the phospholipids and phosphatidyl cholines<br>
(lecithins), both natural and synthetic. Methods to form liposomes are known in the<br>
art. See, for example, Prescott, Ed., Methods in Cell Biology, Volume XIV,<br>
Academic Press, New York, N.W. (1976), p.33 etseq.<br>
While the compounds of the invention can be administered as the sole active<br>
pharmaceutical agent, they can also be used in combination with one or more other<br>
agents used in the treatment of fibromyalgia. Representative agents useful in<br>
combination with the compounds of the invention for the treatment of fibromyalgia<br>
include, for example, serotonin uptake inhibitors, mood stabilizing drags, and the<br>
like.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
Patients diagnosed as suffering from fibromyalgia were treated with<br>
primapexole, a Parkinson's disease dopamine D2/D3 receptor agonist. It was<br>
hypothesized that dopamine D2/D3 receptor agonists might suppress hyperadrenergic<br>
stimuli and thereby facilitate improved deep, restorative sleep (stage 4) in patients<br>
suffering from fibromyalgia. An open label experimental trial of Mirapex®<br>
(pramipexole) was conducted with patients initially meeting criteria for fibromyalgia<br>
to determine if improved sleep might help alleviate fibromj'algia symptoms. The<br>
study included 166 consecutive patients (157-F, 9-M) who had been only partially<br>
responsive to previous multiple medications (mean 6.4) and had seen multiple<br>
physicians (mean 5.7) in their search for effective treatment. The tolerance, safety<br>
profile and patient response to primapexole was assessed over an about 2-12<br>
(mean 4) month period. Pain score [l/2 point (trace), 1+ (classic tenderness),<br><br>
2+(severe), 3+(exquisite)] for 18 classic tender points (max. 54) was noted before<br>
and after increasing the primapexole dosage from 0.125mg qhs up to 6.0 mg qhs<br>
slowly over 8 weeks.<br>
Intolerance (n=39., 22%) correlated with psychiatric care (p
quite with increasing age (p=0.54), and not with disability or pretreatment pain<br>
score 24.5 (intolerant) vs. 24.6 (tolerant). Median discontinuation of primapexole by<br>
primapexole intolerant patients was in 7 days (8.4% paradoxical stimulatory<br>
response, 4.8% nausea, 3.0% headache, 1.8% groggy, 1.8% psychiatry, 1.8% dizzy,<br>
1.2% sicca, 0.6% hives, and 0.6% back pain). For those who tolerated primapexole<br>
(n=129), mean pain score decreased from 24.5 to 11.4 with a mean dose of 1.55 mg<br>
qhs while 29% were pain free, 43.4% were well (score 
points (mean 18), 20% were unchanged and 3.8% were worse. Lack of improvement<br>
correlated with psychiatric care (p
(n=166), but not with age, gender or pretreatment pain score. Table 2 presents a<br>
summary of the percent change in pain symptoms observed in patients undergoing<br>
treatment with pramipexole.<br><br>
^Paiii points for patient were zero.<br>
2Pain points for patient decreased by at least 4 points.<br>
3Pain points for patient decreased by at least 1 point.<br>
4Pain points for patient did not change.<br>
5Pain points for patient increased by at least 1 point.<br>
6Patients tolerated treatment with pramipexole for more than seven days.<br>
Patient characteristics are summarized in Table 3.<br><br><br><br>
Co-morbidity are as follows: (estimates): Rheumatoid arthritis (15%),<br>
psoriatic arthritis (5%), spondylitis (5%), lupus (3%), disk disease (20%), lumbar<br>
facet OA (10%), extremity osteoarthritis (5%), soft tissue injury (15%), cancer<br>
(1%), post-traumatic stress disorder (55%), bipolar (12%), anxiety (30%),<br>
depression (60%), painful neuropathy (5%), substance abuse (1%), child/spouse<br>
abuse (80%).<br>
In addition, the treatment of fibromyalgia with the dopamine receptor D2/D3<br>
agonist pramipexole has also been conducted while the patient was concurrently use<br>
the following medicaments: antidepressants: trazodone, amitriptyline, doxepin, and<br>
nortriptyline; selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors: Prozac®, Paxil®, Zoloft®,<br>
Effexor®, and Celexa®; neuroleptics: Neurontin® and Depakote®; the bipolar<br>
compound lithium; the antipsychotic Remeron®; benzodiazepines: Ativan®,<br>
Klonopin®, Valium®, Xanax®, Restoril®; hypnotics: Ambien® and Sonata®;<br>
muscle relaxants: cyclobenzaprine and carisoprodol; narcotics: darvocet-N®,<br>
codeine, hydrocodone, oxycodone, morphine, and fentanyl; herbals: valerian root,<br>
melatonin, kava kava, picnolgenol, coQ10 and magnesium; and all non-steroidal anti-<br>
inflammatory drugs. No drug interactions have been observed between pramipexole<br>
and any of the above noted compounds except, increased somnolence as pramipexole<br>
becomes effective.<br>
The results presented in Table 2 show that administration of primapexole to<br>
patients diagnosed with fibromyalgia is correlated with a decrease in musculoskeletal<br>
pain symptoms as measured by tender point indexes. These results further suggest<br>
that fibromyalgia somehow interferes with deep restorative sleep and other<br>
treatments that tend to improve the control of sympathetic tone and restlessness<br><br>
which otherwise interfere with sleep may help reduce the refractory pain associated<br>
with fibromyalgia.<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
Patients diagnosed as suffering from fibromyalgia were treated with 4-[2-<br>
(dipropylamino)-ethyl]-1 ,3 ,dihydro-2H-inodole-2-one monohydro chloride, a<br>
Parkinson's disease dopamine D2/D3 receptor agonist which is known to suppress<br>
hyperadrenergic stimuli and thereby facilitate improved deep, restorative sleep. An<br>
open label experimental trial of Requip® (ropinirole) was conducted with patients<br>
initially meeting criteria for fibromyalgia to determine if improved sleep might help<br>
alleviate fibromyalgia symptoms. The demographics of the patients treated with<br>
ropinirole reflected those who did not tolerate treatment with pramipexole.<br>
The study included 14 patients who had been only partially responsive to<br>
previous multiple medications such as, for example Sinemet®, Ativan® or<br>
Klonopin®. The tolerance, safety profile and patient response to ropinirole was<br>
assessed over an about 3-12 (mean 4) month period. Pain score [V2 point (trace), 1+<br>
(classic tenderness), 2+(severe), 3+(exquisite)] for 18 classic tender points (max. 54)<br>
was noted before and after increasing the ropinirole dosage from 0.25mg qhs up to<br>
4.0 mg qhs slowly over 8 weeks. Mean pain score decreased from 21.7 to 14.0 with<br>
a mean dose of 2.3 mg qhs. About 64% (9/14) of the patients exhibited an improved<br>
tender points index, while 28% (4/14) were unchanged and 7% (1/14) were worse.<br>
The above noted results show that administration of ropinirole to patients<br>
diagnosed with fibromyalgia is correlated with a decrease in musculoskeletal pain<br>
symptoms as measured by tender point indexes.<br>
While various embodiments of the invention have been illustrated and<br>
described, it will be appreciated that various changes can be made therein without<br>
departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.<br><br>
