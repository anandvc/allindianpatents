3. PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is  to be performed : -<br><br>
The present invention relates to a gas-barrier film that is transparent, has gas barrier properties against oxygen, water vapor<br>
and the like and is particularly suited to packaging materials with excellent gas barrier properties under conditions of high<br>
humidity, to a gas-barrier layered body, and to a process for producing the same.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Transparent gas-barrier films formed by depositing an inorganic oxide such as silicon oxide, aluminum oxide or the like by<br>
vacuum deposition, sputtering, ion plating, chemical vapor phase epitaxy or the like on a film substrate have become<br>
popular in recent years as gas-barrier materials against oxygen, water vapor or the like.<br>
The problem is that since these transparent gas-barrier films are generally formed by depositing an inorganic oxide on the<br>
surface of a substrate consisting of a tough, transparent biaxial oriented polyester film, left as is the deposited layer is<br>
vulnerable to abrasion during use, and when the film is used as a packaging film, the gas barrier properties may be<br>
adversely affected by cracks in the inorganic oxide that occur due to abrasion and stretching during subsequent printing or<br>
lamination or during filling with the contents, so adequate gas barrier properties cannot be achieved simply with inorganic<br>
oxide deposition.<br>
Methods have been proposed of laminating polyvinyl alcohol or ethylene-vinyl alcohol copolymer with gas barrier properties<br>
on a biaxial oriented film substrate (see for example Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. S60-157830, Claims), or<br>
covering a biaxial oriented film substrate with a composition of polyvinyl alcohol and poly(meth)acrylic acid (see for example<br>
Japanese Patent Publication 3203287, Claim 1).  However, the oxygen barrier properties of a gas-barrier film formed by<br>
laminating polyvinyl alcohol are lower under highly humid conditions, while a composition of polyvinyl alcohol and<br>
poly(meth)acrylic acid has problems of productivity because it requires long-term heating at high temperatures to promote<br>
esterification and improve the gas barrier properties of the film, and its gas barrier properties are also insufficient under<br>
humid conditions.  When reacted for a long time at high temperatures, moreover, the film discolors, detracting from its<br>
appearance, so improvements are required for purposes of food packaging.<br>
Since a composition of polyvinyl alcohol and poly(meth)acrylic acid requires a long-term reaction at high temperatures to<br>
achieve esterification, methods have been proposed of adding an isocyanate compound or other crosslinking component to<br>
the polyacrylic acid (see for example Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. 2001-310425, Claim 1, Example 1) or<br>
further reacting it'with metal ions (see for example Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. 2003-171419, Claim 1, Table<br>
1), but even these methods require high-temperature treatment for 5 minutes at 180 to 200*C as described in the Examples<br>
in order to crosslink the polyacrylic acid with the crosslinking component.<br>
Other means that have been proposed for solving the problems of prior art include a method of laminating polyvinyl alcohol<br>
with gas bamer properties on a metal oxide thin film (see for example Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. H6-<br>
316025, Claim 1), a laminated film comprising a deposited layer of an inorganic compound coated on the surface with a<br>
coating agent consisting mainly of a an aqueous solution or mixed water/alcohol solution of a water-soluble polymer and at<br>
least one of (a) one or more alkoxides and/or hydrolysates thereof and (b) tin chloride (Japanese Patent Publication<br>
2790054, Claim 1), a laminated film obtained by applying a coating composition consisting of a specific organosilane, a silyl<br>
group-containing fluorine polymer and an organopolysiloxane (Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. 2000-63752,<br>
Claim 7, Claim 11), and a gas barrier coating film obtained by applying a coating agent comprising a polyvinyl alcohol resin<br>
and a metal alcoholate (Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. 2002-173631, Claim 1, Claim 11). However, gas barrier<br>
films obtained by laminating polyvinyl alcohol may have lower oxygen barrier properties under high humidity conditions,<br>
while a composition of ethylene-vinyl alcohol copolymer and poly(meth)acrylic acid requires high-temperature treatment for 5<br>
minutes at 180'C to 200*C in order to obtain barrier properties under high humidity conditions.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a gas-barrier film with excellent gas barrier properties under high<br>

BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION (Unsaturated carboxylic acid compound)<br>
The unsaturated carboxylic acid compound of the present invention is a carboxylic acid compound such as acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, maleic acid or itaconic acid having an a.p-ethylene unsaturated group, and is a polymer with a degree of polymerization of less than 20 or preferably a monomer or polymer with a degree of polymerization of 10 or less. This is because a film obtained by polymerizing a salt of a polymer (polymer compound) with a degree of polymerization over 20 with a polyvalent metal compound does not have good gas barrier properties under high humidity conditions. Of these unsaturated carboxylic acid compounds, a monomer is preferred because it easily forms a salt which is entirely neutralized by the polyvalent metal compound, and a film obtained by polymerizing this salt has excellent gas barrier properties.<br>
(Polyvalent metal compound)<br>
The polyvalent metal compound of the present invention is specifically a bivalent or higher metal such as magnesium (Mg), calcium (Ca), barium (Ba), zinc (Zn), copper (Cu), cobalt (Co), nickel (Ni), aluminum (Al), iron (Fe) or the like, or an oxide, hydroxide, halide, carbonate, phosphate, phosphite, hypophosphite, sulfate or sulfite of one of these metals. Of these metal compounds, a bivalent metal compound is desirable, and magnesium oxide, calcium oxide, barium oxide, zinc oxide, magnesium hydroxide, calcium hydroxide, barium hydroxide, zinc hydroxide or the like is particularly desirable. When these bivalent metal compounds are used, a film obtained by polymerization of a salt thereof with the aforementioned unsaturated carboxylic compound has particularly good gas barrier properties under high humidity conditions. At least one of these is used, and only one can be used or two or more can be used in combination.<br><br>

aforementioned polyvalent metal salt of an unsaturated carboxylic acid compound has particularly good gas barrier<br>
properties under high humidity conditions. At least one such univalent metal compound is used, and only one may be used<br>

carboxylic acid compound with a degree of polymerization of less than 20 and the aforementioned polyvalent metal<br>
compound. One such polyvalent metal salt of an unsaturated carboxylic acid compound can be used, or a mixture of two or<br>
more may be used. Of these unsaturated carboxylic acid compound polyvalent metal salts, zinc (meth)acrylate is desirable<br>
for obtaining excellent hot water resistance of the resulting copolymer layer.<br>
(Univalent metal salt of unsaturated carboxylic acid compound)<br>
The univalent salt of an unsaturated carboxylic acid compound which is the basis for copolymer (A1) of metal salts of<br>

compound with a degree of polymerization of less than 20 and the aforementioned univalent metal compound. One such<br>
unsaturated carboxylic acid compound univalent metal salt may be used, or a mixture of two or more may be used.<br>
When this univalent metal salt of an unsaturated carboxylic acid compound is used, a gas-barrier film comprising the<br>
resulting copolymer (A1) has excellent anti-static properties. The greater the added amount of the univalent metal salt, the<br>
greater the anti-static properties.<br>
Of these univalent metal salts of unsaturated carboxylic acid compounds, potassium (meth)acrylate is desirable for obtaining<br>
excellent anti-static properties of a gas-barrier film of the resulting copolymer (A1).<br>
(Polyvalent unsaturated carboxylic acid ester)<br>
This polyvalent unsaturated carboxylic acid ester which is one component making up copolymer (A2) of the gas-barrier film<br>

(Water-soluble polymer (B))<br>
The water-soluble polymer (B) which is one component making up the polymer (A3) of a polyvalent metal salt of an<br>
unsaturated carboxylic acid compound in the gas-barrier film of the present invention comprising 50% or less by weight of a<br>
water-soluble polymer (B) may be a natural water-soluble polymer such as starch, gum arabic or a polysaccharide, a<br>
cellulose derivative such as methylcellulose, ethylcellulose or carboxymethylcellulose, a semi-synthetic water-soluble<br><br>
polymer such as denatured starch, a vinyl alcohol polymer such as polyvinyl alcohol or ethylene-vinyl alcohol copolymer, or<br>
a synthetic water-soluble polymer such as polyvinylpyrrolidone, polyvinyl ethyl ether, polyacrylamide, polyethyleneimine or<br>
the like.<br>
Of these water-soluble polymers, starch, polysaccharides and cellulose derivatives and hydroxyl-containing polymers such<br>
as vinyl alcohol polymers having hydroxyl groups in the molecule are desirable for improving the gas barrier properties<br>
under conditions of low humidity.<br>
In particular, vinyl alcohol polymers such as polyvinyl alcohol and ethylene-vinyl alcohol copolymer not only provide<br>
improved gas barrier properties under conditions of low humidity, but are also desirable because they do not detract from<br>
the gas barrier properties under high-humidity conditions in a film comprising a polymer of a polyvalent metal salt of an<br>
unsaturated carboxylic acid compound.<br>
(Gas-barrier film)<br>
The first mode of the gas-barrier film of the present invention is a film obtained by polymerization of the aforementioned<br>
polyvalent metal salt of an unsaturated carboxylic acid compound, and comprises a polymer (A) of a polyvalent metal salt of<br>
an unsaturated carboxylic acid compound which gives an infrared absorption spectrum in which the ratio of the absorbance<br>
Ao at around 1,700 cm-1 attributable to the vC=0 of the carboxylic acid group to the absorbance A at around 1,520cm-1<br>
attributable to the vC=0 of the carboxylate ion, (Ao/A), is lower than 0.25 and preferably lower than 0.20.<br>
A gas-barrier film comprising polymer (A) of a polyvalent metal salt of an unsaturated carboxylic acid compound includes<br>
both free carboxylic acid and carboxylate ions formed by ion crosslinking of the carboxylic acid groups and polyvalent metal,<br>
and in the infrared absorbance spectrum the absorbance attributable to the vCO of the free carboxylic acid groups is about<br>
1,700 cm-1 while the absorbance attributable to the vCO of the carboxylate ions is around 1520 cm-1.<br>
Consequently, in the gas-barrier film of the present invention an (Ao/A) ratio of less than 0.25 means that there are either<br>
very few or no free carboxylic acid groups, while in a film with an (Ao/A) ratio over 0.25 the content of carboxylic acid groups<br>
is higher, and the gas barrier properties under conditions of high humidity are not improved.<br>
In the present invention, the ratio (Ao/A) of the absorbance Ao at around 1,700 cnr1 attributable to the vC=0 of the<br>
carboxylic acid groups to the absorbance A at around 1,520cm-1 attributable to the vC=0 of the carboxylate ions in the<br>
infrared absorbance spectrum was measured by cutting out a 1 cm x 3 cm measurement sample from the gas-barrier film<br>
(gas-barrier layered body), obtaining the infrared absorbance spectrum of the surface (layer of polyvalent metal salt of<br>
unsaturated carboxylic acid compound) by infrared total reflectance measurement (ATR), and deriving absorbance Ao and<br>
absorbance A by the following procedures.<br>
Absorbance Ao at around 1,700 cm-1 attributable to the vC=0 of the carboxylic acid groups:	The absorbance values<br>
at 1660 cm-1 and 1760 cm-1 in the infrared absorbance spectrum were connected with a straight line (N), a straight line (O)<br>
was drawn vertically down from the maximum absorbance (near 1700 cnr1) between 1660 and 1760 cm-1, and the distance<br>
(length) in absorbance between the intersection of straight line (O) and straight line (N) and the maximum absorbance was<br>
given as absorbance Ao.<br>
Absorbance A at around 1,520cm-1 attributable to the vCO of the carboxylate ions: The absorbance values at 1480 cm-1<br>
and 1630 cm-1 in the infrared absorbance spectrum were connected with a straight line (L), a straight line (M) was drawn<br>
vertically down from the maximum absorbance (near 1520 cm-1) between 1480 and 1630 crrr1, and the distance (length) in<br>
absorbance between the intersection of straight line (M) and straight line (L) and the maximum absorbance was given as<br>
absorbance A. The peak position of the maximum absorbance (near 1520 cm-1) varies depending on the metal species of<br>
the counter-ions, and is for example near 1520 cm-1 in the case of calcium, near 1520 cm-1 in the case of zinc, near 1540<br>
cnr1 in the case of magnesium and near 1540 cnr1 in the case of sodium (Na).<br>
Next, the ratio (Ao/A) was derived from the absorbance values Ao and A obtained by the aforementioned methods. In the<br>
present invention, infrared spectrum measurement (attenuated total reflectance: ATR) was performed under conditions of<br>
incidence angle 45*, room temperature, resolution 4 cm"1, times 150 using a Jasco FT-IR350 mounted with a KRS-5<br>
(Thallium Bromide-Iodide) crystal.<br>
The second mode of the gas-barrier film of the present invention is a gas-barrier film wherein the polymer (A) of the<br>
aforementioned first mode is a copolymer (A1) of the aforementioned polyvalent metal salt of an unsaturated carboxylic acid<br>
compound with 50% mole or less or preferably 40% mole or less or more preferably 30% mole or less of a univalent metal<br>
salt of an unsaturated carboxylic acid compound (with the total of the univalent metal salt of an unsaturated carboxylic acid<br>
compound and the polyvalent metal salt of an unsaturated carboxylic acid compound equaling 100% mole).<br>
The gas-bamer film of the second mode of the present invention comprises copolymer (A1) of a polyvalent metal salt of an<br>
unsaturated carboxylic acid compound and a univalent metal salt of an unsaturated carboxylic acid compound, wherein the<br>
ratio (Ao/A) of the absorbance Ao at around 1,700 cm-1 attributable to the vC=0 of the carboxylic acid groups to the<br>
absorbance A at around 1,520cm-1 attributable to the vC=0 of the carboxylate ions in the infrared absorbance spectrum is<br>
less than 0.25 or preferably less than 0.20.<br>
This is because the gas barrier properties and in particular the gas barrier properties (oxygen barrier properties) under<br>
conditions of high humidity are adversely affected if the content of the univalent metal salt of an unsaturated carboxylic acid<br>
compound in the film exceeds 50% mole.<br><br>
Moreover, a gas-barrier film obtained by co-polymerization of a univalent metal salt of an unsaturated carboxylic acid<br>
compound has a lower surface resistivity value than the aforementioned film obtained by polymerization of a polyvalent<br>
metal salt of an unsaturated carboxylic acid compound, providing a gas-barrier film with superior anti-static properties, and<br>
the anti-static properties are greater the greater the added amount of the univalent salt of an unsaturated carboxylic acid<br>
compound.<br>
When potassium (K) is used for the univalent metal salt of the unsaturated carboxylic acid compound, moreover, the<br>
resulting gas-barrier film also has a lower surface resistivity and superior anti-static properties.<br>

(Ao/A) of the absorbance Ao at around 1,700 cm-1 attributable to the vC=0 of the carboxylic acid groups to the absorbance A<br>
at around 1,520cm-1 attributable to the vCO of the carboxylate ions in the infrared absorbance spectrum is less than 0.25<br>
or preferably less than 0.20.<br>
A gas-barrier film (A2) comprising a polyvalent unsaturated carboxylic acid ester as a copolymerization component is<br>
tougher (has greater elongation) than a film obtained by polymerization of the aforementioned polyvalent metal salt of an<br>
unsaturated carboxylic acid compound. If the content of the polyvalent unsaturated carboxylic ester exceeds 50% by weight,<br>
however, the gas barrier properties and particularly the gas banier properties (oxygen barrier properties) under high<br>
humidity conditions will be adversely affected.<br>

aforementioned first mode is polymer (A3) comprising the aforementioned polyvalent metal salt of an unsaturated carboxylic<br>
acid compound along with 50% or less or preferably 40% or less or more preferably 30% or less by weight of water-soluble<br>
polymer (B).<br>
The fourth mode of the gas-barrier film of the present invention comprises a copolymer (A3) containing a water-soluble<br>
polymer (B) and the aforementioned polyvalent metal salt of an unsaturated carboxylic acid compound, wherein the ratio<br>
(Ao/A) of the absorbance Ao at around 1,700 cm"1 attributable to the vC=0 of the carboxylic acid groups to the absorbance A<br>
at around 1,520cm-1 attributable to the vC=0 of the carboxylate ions in the infrared absorbance spectrum is less than 0.25<br>
or preferably less than 0.20.<br>
A gas-barrier film containing a water-soluble polymer (B) has better gas barrier properties under low-humidity conditions<br>
than a film obtained by polymerization of the aforementioned polyvalent metal salt of an unsaturated carboxylic acid<br>
compound, and also has toughness (elongation). If the content of the water-soluble polymer (B) in the film exceeds 50% by<br>
weight, however, the gas banier properties and in particular the gas barrier properties (oxygen barrier properties) under<br>
high-humidity conditions will be adversely affected.<br>
In addition to the aforementioned water-soluble polymer (B), the gas-barrier film of the present invention may also include<br>
acrylic acid ester polymer, ethylene-acrylic acid copolymer, vinyl polyacetate, ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer, polyester,<br>
polyurethane and other high-molecular-weight compounds (polymers) to the extent that these do not detract from the object<br>
of the present invention.<br>
Moreover, the unsaturated carboxylic acid compound that forms the gas-barrier film of the present invention may also<br>
include, in addition to the aforementioned polyvalent unsaturated carboxylic acid ester, methyl (meth)acrylate, ethyl<br>
(meth)acrylate and other acrylic acid ester compounds, vinyl acetate and other vinyl ester compounds, and ethylene and<br>

(Method for manufacturing gas-barrier film and gas-barrier layered body)<br>
The method for manufacturing a gas-barrier film and gas-bamer layered body of the present invention (hereunder<br>
sometimes called "method for manufacturing a gas-bamer film or the like) is a method for manufacturing a gas-barrier<br>
layered body by applying a solution of a polyvalent metal salt of an unsaturated carboxylic acid compound to at least one<br>
side of a substrate, and then polymerizing the polyvalent metal salt of an unsaturated carboxylic acid compound.<br>
In the method for manufacturing a gas-barrier film or the like of the present invention, the gas-barrier layered body of the<br>
specifications of the application having a gas-barrier film layered on at least one side can be obtained using the<br>
aforementioned substrate layer (C) as the substrate. A single-layer gas-barrier film of the present invention can also be<br>
obtained using the aforementioned substrate layer (C) or a glass, ceramic, metal or other inorganic substance or other<br>
material as the substrate by peeling off the substrate a polymer (A) obtained by polymerizing a polyvalent metal salt of an<br>
unsaturated carboxylic acid compound or the like.<br>
When manufacturing the gas-bamer film or the like of the present invention, the unsaturated carboxylic acid compound and<br>
polyvalent metal compound can be first reacted to obtain a polyvalent metal salt of an unsaturated carboxylic acid<br>
compound, which is then made into a solution, or the unsaturated carboxylic acid compound and polyvalent metal<br>
compound can be directly dissolved together in a solvent to obtain a solution of a polyvalent metal salt.<br><br>
In the method for manufacturing a gas-barrier film or the like of the present invention, when the unsaturated carboxylic acid compound and polyvalent metal compound are directly dissolved together in a solvent, or in other words when using a solution comprising the unsaturated carboxylic acid compound and polyvalent metal compound, the polyvalent metal compound is preferably added in an amount exceeding 0.3 chemical equivalents of the unsaturated carboxylic acid compound. When using a mixed solution in which the added amount of the polyvalent metal compound is 0.3 chemical equivalents or less, the resulting layered body will contain a large amount of free carboxylic acid groups, resulting in a layered body with poor gas-barrier properties. Although there is no particular upper limit on the added amount of the polyvalent metal compound, since more unreacted polyvalent metal compound remains when the added amount of the polyvalent metal compound exceeds one chemical equivalent, 5 or fewer chemical equivalents or more preferably 2 or fewer chemical equivalents are normally sufficient.<br>
Moreover, when using a mixed solution of the unsaturated carboxylic acid compound and polyvalent metal compound, a polyvalent metal salt of the unsaturated carboxylic acid compound forms as the unsaturated carboxylic acid compound and polyvalent metal compound are being dissolved in the solvent, but they should be mixed for at least one minute to ensure formation of the polyvalent metal salt.<br>
The solvent used for the solution of the polyvalent metal salt of an unsaturated carboxylic acid compound or the like may be an organic solvent such as water, an acetone or lower alcohol such as methyl alcohol, ethyl alcohol or isopropyl alcohol, or methyl ethyl ketone or the like or a mixed solvent of these, but water is most preferred.<br>
There are no particular limits on the method of applying the polyvalent metal salt of an unsaturated carboxylic acid compound or the like to at least one side of substrate layer (C) or the like, and a variety of known methods may be adopted. Specific examples include dipping substrate layer (C) or the like in the solution and spraying the solution on the surface of substrate layer (C) or the like, or it may be applied using an air knife coater, direct gravure coater, gravure offset, arc gravure coater, gravure reverse, jet nozzle system or other gravure coater, a top feed reverse coater, bottom feed reverse coater, nozzle feed reverse coater or other reverse coater, or a 5-roll coater, lip coater, bar coater, bar reverse coater, dye coater or any other known coater in the amount of 0.05 to 10 g/m2 or preferably 0.1 to 5 g/m2 as solids in a solution of the polyvalent metal salt of an unsaturated carboxylic acid compound.<br>
As discussed above, a gas-barrier film or gas-barrier layered body with improved anti-static properties, toughness (elongation), or toughness (elongation) and gas-barrier properties under low-humidity conditions can be obtained if at least one of 50% mole or less of a univalent metal salt of an unsaturated carboxylic acid compound, 50% or less by weight of a polyvalent unsaturated carboxylic acid ester and 50% or less by weight of a water-soluble polymer (B) is dissolved when dissolving the polyvalent metal salt of an unsaturated carboxylic acid compound or when dissolving the unsaturated carboxylic acid compound and polyvalent metal compound together.<br>
In addition to the aforementioned compounds, a monomer or low-molecular-weight compound such as methyl (meth)acrylate, ethyl (meth)acrylate or another unsaturated carboxylic acid ester compound or vinyl acetate or another vinyl ester compound or the like or a high-molecular-weight compound (polymer) such as an acrylic acid ester polymer, ethylene-acrylic acid copolymer, vinyl polyacetate, ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer, polyester, polyurethane or the like can also be added when dissolving the polyvalent metal salt of an unsaturated carboxylic acid compound or the like to the extent that this does not detract from the object of the present invention.<br>
Various additives such as lubricants, slipping agents, anti-blocking agents, anti-static agents, anti-clouding agents, pigments, dyes and inorganic and organic fillers and the like can also be added when dissolving the polyvalent metal salt of an unsaturated carboxylic acid compound or when dissolving the unsaturated carboxylic acid compound and polyvalent metal compound to the extent that this does not detract from the object of the invention, and various surfactants and the like may also be added to improve wettability with substrate layer (C).<br>
Methods of obtaining polymer (A) by polymerizing the polyvalent metal salt of an unsaturated carboxylic acid compound or the mixture of an unsaturated carboxylic acid compound and polyvalent metal compound applied to substrate layer (C) or the like include a variety of known methods, such as specifically methods using heating, exposure to ionizing radiation and the like.<br>
When using ionizing radiation, there are no particular limits as long as the energy rays are in the wavelength range of 0.0001 to 800 nm, but examples include alpha rays, beta rays, gamma rays, x rays, visible rays, ultraviolet rays, electron rays and the like. Of these types of ionizing radiation, visible rays in the wavelength range of 400 to 800 nm, ultraviolet rays in the range of 50 to 400 nm and electron rays in the range of 0.01 to 0.002 are preferred because they are easy to handle and the equipment is easily available.<br>
When using visible rays and ultraviolet rays as the ionizing radiation, a photopolymerizatjon initiator needs to be added to the solution of the polyvalent metal salt of an unsaturated carboxylic acid compound or the like. A known photopolymerization initiator may be used, and examples include 2-hydroxy-2-tnethyl-1-phenyl-propan-1-one (Darocur 1173®, Chiba Specialty Chemicals), 1-hydroxy-cyclohexyl-phenylketone (Irgacure 184®, Chiba Specialty Chemicals), bis(2,4,6-trimethylbenzoyl)-phenylphosphineoxide (Irgacure 819s, Chiba Specialty Chemicals), 1-[4-(2-hydroxyethoxy)-phenyl]-2-hydroxy-2-methyl-1-propane-1-one (Irgacure 2959®, Chiba Specialty Chemicals), a mixture of alpha-hydroxyketone, acylphosphine oxide, 4-methylbenzophenone and 2,4,6-trimethylbenzophenone (Esacure KT046®, Lamberti Chemical Specialty), Esacure KT55 (Lamberti Chemical Specialty), 2,4,6-trimethylbenzoyl diphenylphosphine oxide<br><br>
(Speedcure TPO®, Lambson Fine Chemicals) and radical polymerization initiators manufactured and sold under other trademarks. A polymerization accelerator may also be added to increase the degree or speed of polymerization, and examples include N,N-dimethylamino-ethyl-(meth)acrylate, N-meth)acryloyl-morphine and the like. The polyvalent metal salt of an unsaturated carboxylic acid compound or the like may be polymerized in a solution containing water or another solvent or may be polymerized after partial drying, but when the applied solution contains a large amount of water or another solvent, the gas-barrier film may turn white if the solution is polymerized immediately after application. On the other hand, as the amount of solvent (moisture) decreases the polyvalent metal salt of an unsaturated carboxylic acid compound may precipitate, and if it is polymerized in this state the gas-barrier film will not form properly. That is, the resulting gas-barrier film may appear white, or its gas-barrier properties may be unstable. Therefore, it is preferable that the applied polyvalent metal salt of an unsaturated carboxylic acid compound be polymerized in a state containing a suitable amount of moisture.<br>
The polyvalent metal salt of an unsaturated carboxylic acid compound or the like may be polymerized in one stage or in two or more stages, or in other words the main polymerization may be preceded by pre-polymerization.A layered film suited as a heat-sealable packaging film can be obtained by laminating a heat-sealable layer on at least one side of the gas-barrier layered film of the present invention. Examples of such heat-sealable layers include layers obtained from ethylene, propylene, butene-1, hexene-1, 4-methyl pentene-1, octane-1 and other alpha-olefins either alone or as copolymers, high-pressure method low-density polyethylene, linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE), high-density polyethylene, polypropylene, polypropylene random copolymers, polybutene, poly-4-methyl pentene -1, low-crystalline or amorphous ethylene-propylene random copolymer and other polyolefins either alone or as compositions of two or more, ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer (EVA), ethylene-(meth)acrylic acid copolymer and metal salts thereof, and compositions of EVA and polyolefins, which are commonly used in heat-sealable layers.<br>
Of these, heat-sealable layers obtained from high-pressure method low-density polyethylene, linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE), high-pressure polyethylene and other ethylene polymers are desirable because of their superior low-temperature heat-sealability and heat seal strength. [Examples]<br>

(7)	Moisture content of solution (coat): a 10 cm * 10 cm sample was quickly cut out from a layered film (film before polymerization by exposure to ultraviolet) obtained by applying a solution containing a polyvalent metal salt of an unsaturated carboxylic acid compound or the like to a substrate film and drying it under specific conditions with a hot-air dryer, and the weight of this sample was measured and given as B1. This sample was then dried for 10 minutes in a 100'C oven, and its weight was again measured and given as B2. The film that had been weighed (as B2) was then water washed to remove the coat and dried for 10 minutes in a 100*C oven, and its weight was again measured and given as B3. Using these values, the moisture content (%) of the coat before polymerization was calculated as (%) = [B1 - B2)/(B1 - B3)] x 100. (Example 1)<br>

on the substrate.<br>
(Comparative Example 5)<br>
Polyacrylic acid (Jurimer® AC10L, average degree of polymerization 347, 40% aqueous solution, Nihon Junyaku) was<br>

dissolved in the amount of 0.6 chemical equivalents of the polyacrylic acid to prepare magnesium-neutralized polyacrylic<br>
acid, and a gas-barrier film was obtained by the same methods as in Comparative Example 3.<br>
The oxygen permeability and absorbance ratio (Ao/A) of the resulting gas-banier layered film are shown in Table 1. When<br>
magnesium hydroxide was added in the amount of 0.7 chemical equivalents of the polyacrylic acid in an effort to raise the<br>

oxygen permeability and absorbance ratio (Ao/A) of the resulting gas-barrier layered film are shown in Table 1. The oxygen<br>
permeability of the gas-barrier layered films obtained in Examples 1 to 7 and Comparative Examples 1 to 6 was measured<br>
using a Mocon OX-TRAN 2/20.<br>

As shown in Table 1, those layered films (Examples 1 to 7) having layers (gas-banier films) consisting of polymers of unsaturated carboxylic acid compound polyvalent metal salts with absorbance ratios (Ao/A) under 0.25 or in other words with<br><br>
few free carboxylic acid groups exhibited good gas-barrier properties (low oxygen permeability) under high-humidity<br>
conditions.<br>
On the other hand, those layered films (Comparative Examples 1, 3, 6) having layers (gas-barrier films) consisting of<br>
polymers of unsaturated carboxylic acid compound polyvalent metal salts with absorbance ratios (Ao/A) of 0.25 or more or in<br>
other words with many free carboxylic acid groups exhibited poor gas barrier properties with high oxygen permeability.<br>
Moreover, the layered film (Comparative Example 2) having a layer (gas-barrier film) consisting of a polymer of a univalent<br>
metal salt (sodium salt) of an unsaturated carboxylic acid compound also exhibited poor gas barrier properties with high<br>
oxygen permeability.<br>
That is, since a monomer of an unsaturated carboxylic acid compound or a polyvalent metal salt of an unsaturated<br>
carobyxlic acid compound with a degree of polymerization of less than 20 is highly soluble and highly water-soluble in<br>
particular even when 100% neutralized, it can be coated uniformly on a substrate layer, and a film obtained by polymerizing<br>
this coating layer is highly neutralized and has good gas-barrier properties even under conditions of high humidity.<br>
However, as also described in known documents, when using a polyacrylic acid with a degree of polymerization over 20 the<br>
polyvalent metal salt of the polyacrylic acid precipitates when an effort is made to raise the degree of neutralization, so that<br>
the solution is not uniform and consequently a film consisting of a polymer of a highly-neutralized unsaturated carboxylic<br>
acid polyvalent metal salt cannot be obtained, and the resulting film has poor gas-banier properties under conditions of high<br>
humidity.<br>

As shown in Table 2, when a substrate layer having an inorganic compound deposition layer was used as the film substrate, the gas-barrier layered films (Examples 8-13) obtained by forming a polymer layer of an unsaturated carboxylic acid compound polyvalent metal salt on the inorganic compound deposition layer all had extremely good oxygen barrier properties and resistance to permeation by water vapor under conditions of high humidity. Of these, the gas-banier films obtained by forming a zinc acrylate polymer layer on an inorganic compound deposition layer maintained excellent oxygen barrier properties and resistance to water vapor permeation under highly humid conditions even after hot water treatment. By contrast, the film having a film of vapor-deposited aluminum oxide (Reference Example 1) had poor oxygen barrier properties under highly humid conditions, although it was resistant to water vapor permeation.<br>
The layered films obtained by forming a polymer layer of a polyvalent metal salt of an unsaturated carboxylic acid compound on a film substrate without a vapor-deposited inorganic compound had much better oxygen barrier properties than the film (Reference Example 2) without a polymer layer of a polyvalent metal salt of an unsaturated carboxylic acid compound, but in comparison with the gas-barrier layered films (Examples 8-13) obtained by forming a polymer layer of a polyvalent metal salt of an unsaturated carboxylic acid compound on an inorganic compound deposition layer, they tended to have poorer oxygen barrier and water vapor barrier properties when the polymer layer of the polyvalent metal salt of an unsaturated carboxylic acid compound was thin (when the spread of the polyvalent metal salt of an unsaturated carboxylic acid compound was smaller) (Examples 14-18).<br>
(Example 19) A 1:1 mixture of solution (X-1) and water was coated to 1.7 g/m2 with a Meyer bar on the corona treated surface of a film substrate consisting of a 12 |jm-thick biaxial oriented polyester film (Emblet® PET 12, Unitika), and dried at 60'C for 12 seconds using a hot-air dryer. The coated film was immediately fixed coated side up on a stainless steel plate, and polymerized by exposure to ultraviolet rays under conditions of UV strength 190 mW/cm2, cumulative exposure 250 mJ/cm2 using a UV irradiator (Eye Graphics EYE GRANDAGE type ECS 301G1) to obtain a layered film. The absorbance ratio (Ao/A) of the polymer layer of the resulting layered film was measured, and aluminum oxide was deposited thereon with an EB heated vacuum deposition unit (Ulvac EBH-6) to obtain a gas-banier layered film. The resulting gas-barrier layered film was evaluated by the methods described above. The evaluation results are shown in Table 3. The oxygen permeability<br><br>
67<br>
and water vapor permeability of the gas-barrier layered film were measured using a multilayer film obtained by dry-laminating it to the surface of the acrylic acid polyvalent metal salt polymer layer (unsaturated carboxylic acid compound polyvalent metal salt polymer layer) of a gas-barrier layered film obtained by coating and drying a urethane adhesive (12 parts by weight polyurethane adhesive (Mitsui Takeda Chemicals, Takelac® A310), 1 part by weight isocyanate hardening agent (Mitsui Takeda Chemicals, Takenate® A3) and 7 parts by weight ethyl acetate (Kanto Chemical)) on one side of a 50 |jm-thick linear low-density polyethylene film (Tohcello T.U.X. FCS®).<br>

As shown in Table 3, the gas-barrier layered films (Examples 19-23) obtained by forming an inorganic compound deposition layer on a polymer layer of a polyvalent metal salt of an unsaturated carboxylic acid compound had extremely good oxygen banier properties under highly humid conditions. Of these, the gas-barrier layered films obtained by forming an inorganic compound deposition layer on a zinc acrylate polymer layer maintained excellent oxygen banier properties under highly humid conditions even after hot water treatment. By contrast, the oxygen barrier properties of the film (Reference Example 3) having a vapor-deposited inorganic compound (aluminum oxide) were unsatisfactory after hot water treatment. In the case of the laminated film (Comparative Example 7) using polyacrylic acid with a degree of polymerization over 20, only a partially-neutralized polycarbonate with a high absorbance ratio (Ao/A = 0.79, abundant free carboxylic acid) was obtained, and the oxygen barrier properties were adversely affected by free carboxylic acid groups infiltrating the aluminum oxide layer.<br><br>

As shown in Table 4, when a univalent metal salt of an unsaturated carboxylic acid compound was added (Examples 24-30)<br>
good gas barrier properties (low oxygen permeability) under high humidity were achieved even with long drying times<br>
because the metal salt was less likely to crystallize. The surface resistivity also tended to be lower (indicated greater static<br>
resistance) the greater the added amount of the univalent metal.<br>
When no univalent metal salt was added (Example 31 and Reference Example 4), on the other hand, strong barrier<br>
properties were achieved with a short drying time (when polymerization was performed with a suitable moisture content)<br>
(Example 31), but when the drying time was extended crystals of the metal salt occurred due to the reduced moisture<br>
content of the film during polymerization, detracting from the gas barrier properties.<br>

As shown in Table 5, when a polyvalent unsaturated carboxylic acid ester was added (Examples 32-39) the gas-barrier properties were less dependent on humidity, and the films were less liable to cracking when drawn. However, when no polyvalent unsaturated carboxylic acid ester was added (Example 40), although resistance to oxygen permeation (oxygen barrier properties) was good under conditions of high humidity, cracking occurred after 2% drawing. (Examples 4144) Aqueous solutions of acrylic acid Zn salt solution (X-2) and water-soluble polymer (B-1) were mixed with zinc acrylate and the water-soluble polymer (B-1) in the weight ratios (solids) shown in Table 6, and these solutions were adjusted to a solids concentration of 20% by weight to prepare coating solutions.

Table 6 shows that in a system including a water-soluble polymer (Examples 41-61), a decrease in oxygen barrier properties<br>
under dry conditions (20'C, 0% RH) is prevented. In a system without a water-soluble polymer (Example 62), on the other<br>
hand, the oxygen barrier properties are good in under humid conditions (20"C, 90% RH) but poorer under dry conditions<br>
(20*C,0%RH).<br>
When the polyacrylic acid is neutralized with zinc oxide (Reference Example 5), the oxygen barrier properties under humid<br>
conditions are not obtained.<br>
Using only the water-soluble polymer (Comparative Examples 8-16), moreover, the oxygen barrier properties are much<br>
poorer under humid conditions (20°C, 90% RH).<br>
(Example 63)<br>
A commercial polyethylene terephthalate container (PET bottle, hollow (C2), 500 ml pressure-resistant type) was coated by<br>
immersing it in an unsaturated carboxylic acid compound Zn salt solution obtained by mixing a zinc acrylate (Zn salt of<br>
acrylic acid) aqueous solution (Asada Chemical, concentration 15% by weight (acrylic acid 10% by weight, Zn 5% by<br>
weight)),   a   photopolymerization   initiator   (1-[4-(2-hydroxyethoxy)-phenyl]-2-hydroxy-2-methyl-1-propan-1-one   (Chiba<br>
Specialty Chemicals, Irgacur® 2959) dissolved to 25% by weight in methyl alcohol, and a surfactant (Emalgen 120®, Kao) in<br>
molar proportions of 98.5%, 1.2% and 0.3%. This was then dried at 60"C for 1 minute in a hot-air dryer, and the entire<br>
container was exposed with an ultraviolet irradiator to 200 mJ/cm2 to obtain a container with a polymer layer of an<br>
unsaturated carboxylic acid compound Zn salt formed on the surface thereof. The polymer layer was 3 ijm thick, with an<br><br>
absorbance ratio (Ao/A) of 0.1. When a 90 mm x 90 mm sample was cut out from the container, its oxygen permeability<br>
(20'C, 90% RH) was 0.1 ml/(m2/day/MPa) as measured with a Mocon OX-TRAN 2/21 ML.<br>
[Effects of the Invention]<br>
The gas barrier film of the present invention, which comprises an unsaturated carboxylic acid compound crosslinked with a<br>
polyvalent metal, and a gas-barrier layered body obtained by layering this gas-bamer film on a substrate layer, have<br>
excellent gas barrier properties under humid conditions because they contain little free carboxylic acid.<br>
Moreover, by using a mixture containing an unsaturated carboxylic compound with a degree of polymerization of less than<br>
20 or a polyvalent metal salt of an unsaturated carboxylic acid compound with a degree of polymerization of less than 20<br>
and 50% or less by weight of a water-soluble polymer, the method for manufacturing a gas-barrier film and gas-bamer<br>
layered body of the present invention allows easy application to a substrate of any shape even if the substrate layer is in film<br>
form, and easily provides a film comprising a polymer of an unsaturated carboxylic acid polyvalent salt compound which is<br>
highly neutralized or in other words has excellent gas barrier properties.<br>
Moreover, in a mode in which a layer comprising a polymer of an unsaturated carboxylic acid compound polyvalent metal<br>
salt with extremely little free carboxylic acid or a layer comprising a polymer of a carboxylic acid compound polyvalent salt is<br>
layered atop an inorganic compound deposition layer, not only are excellent gas barrier properties (oxygen barrier<br>
properties) obtained under highly humid conditions, but the moisture-proofing (barrier properties against water vapor) and<br>
hot water resistance are also excellent.<br>
Moreover, a gas-barrier layered body comprising a substrate layer having layered thereon a gas-barrier film comprising an<br>
unsaturated carboxylic acid compound polyvalent metal salt copolymer containing 50% or less mole of an unsaturated<br>
carboxylic acid compound univalent metal salt gas excellent gas barrier properties under highly humid conditions because it<br>
contains little free carboxylic acid.<br>
Moreover, a gas-barrier film comprising a copolymer of an unsaturated carboxylic acid compound polyvalent metal salt with<br>
50% or less by weight of a polyvalent unsaturated carboxylic acid ester and a gas-barrier film comprising a polymer of an<br>
unsaturated carboxylic acid compound polyvalent metal salt containing 50% or less by weight of a water-soluble polymer are<br>
both very transparent and have excellent gas barrier properties against, oxygen, water vapor and the like, particularly under<br>
highly humid conditions, as well as being flexible.<br>
INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY<br>
The gas-banier film comprising a polymer of a polyvalent metal salt of a carboxylic acid compound and the gas-banier<br>
layered body having this gas-banier film formed thereon of the present invention have excellent resistance to oxygen<br>
permeation (gas barrier properties) under highly humid conditions, and because of this property they can be used favorably<br>
as packaging materials, particularly food packaging materials for contents that require high gas barrier properties, and also<br>
as packaging materials for medical uses, electronic materials, industrial uses and a variety of other products, or as<br>
protective materials for electronic materials, medical products, and other materials that need to be protected from oxygen<br>
gas and moisture.<br><br><br>
