CAM WEAVE MECHANISM, WEAVING MACHINE FITTED THEREWITH, METHOD FOR ASSEMBLING SAID MECHANISM<br>
The invention relates to a cam weave mechanism for a loom and a loom fitted with such a mechanism and a method of assembling such a mechanism.<br>
In the field of looms, cam weave mechanisms are known that comprise a series of oscillating levers in numbers equal to those of the heddle frames to be mounted on the loom, each oscillating lever being designed to be coupled to one of the frames and fitted with two rollers which interact with the two tracks of a matching cam rotated by a common shaft. During the initial manufacture of the mechanism or during the modification of the weave, the cams, that usually number between four and twelve, must be mounted onto their drive shaft. They must be mounted with great precision in order to prevent or limit to a very large degree the clearances between the adjoining tracks of the cams and the cam followers.<br>
In certain known mechanisms, the frame of the mechanism defines two half-bearings onto which are fitted collars or flanges forming the other half of the bearings after the common shaft fitted with the cams has been installed on the half-bearings formed by the frame. This technique involves inaccuracies in the positioning of the shaft relative to the frame, so that the value of the distance between the axis of the cam shaft and the axis of articulation of the oscillating levers cannot be guaranteed with precision, likewise the parallelism of these axes.<br>
To achieve a good positioning of the main geometric axes of the mechanism, it is known practice to use frames in which two on fices are defined for supporting the common cam shaft, with interposition of bearings. In this case, it is a known practice to mount the<br><br>
- 2 -<br>
various cams on a sleeve or "barrel" outside the mechanism and then to place the barrel, fitted with the cams prevented from rotating and indexed angularly, between the two parts of the frame in which the single-piece orifices are defined, then insert the drive shaft through one of these orifices, through the sleeve then through the second orifice. This technique requires the handling of heavy and bulky parts when the barrel is inserted into the mechanism frame. The cams must be mounted onto the barrel outside the machine, on a bench, which requires means of transport and wastes time .<br>
It is these disadvantages that the invention intends more particularly to remedy by proposing a weave mechanism in which the earns can be mounted and removed on the machine itself, without wasting time, without making use of special tools and without compromising the precision of the positioning of their common drive shaft relative to the mechanism frame and to the oscillating levers interacting with these cams.<br>
With this in mind, the invention relates to a cam weave mechanism for a loom, this mechanism comprising several cams mounted on a common drive shaft and provided with roller tracks for cam followers themselves mounted on oscillating levers, this drive shaft being supported by means of two orifices made in two single-piece parts of the mechanism frame and one of which is traversed by this shaft. This mechanism is characterized in that the aforementioned shaft extends from the first orifice and in the direction of the second orifice over a length that is less than the distance between these orifices, while detachable means forming an extension and support connect the end of this shaft situated between these orifices to the second orifice and while the difference between the distance between the orifices and the length over which the shaft extends between these orifices is greater than the width of a cam.<br><br>
- 3 -<br>
Thanks to the invention, a space is created between the end of the,shaft and the part of the frame in which the second orifice is made, which makes it possible to use this space, before insertion of the means forming extension or after removal of the latter, to install the cams on the shaft already installed in the frame. The cams are installed individually on their drive shaft, so that it is not necessary to use a barrel, each cam having a weight and a bulk compatible with easy handling.<br>
According to advantageous but not obligatory aspects, a weave mechanism may incorporate one or more of the following features taken in all technically acceptable combinations:<br>
-	The means forming an extension and support carry or<br>
form a bearing supporting the end of the shaft<br>
situated between the two orifices<br>
-	The means forming an extension and support comprise<br>
an end-piece capable of being fitted onto the end of<br>
the shaft and of exerting on the cams mounted on this<br>
shaft an axial force to grip the cams to prevent them<br>
from rotating. This end-piece is advantageously<br>
fixedly attached in rotation to the end of the shaft.<br>
It may extend axially up to the second orifice of the<br>
frame into which it is inserted, with a bearing<br>
interposed.<br>
-	The means forming an extension and support comprise a<br>
sleeve mounted detachably in the second orifice and<br>
extending in the direction of the end of the shaft.<br>
This sleeve advantageously extends to this end which<br>
it surrounds, with a bearing interposed. When an end-<br>
piece is provided, the sleeve may extend axially to<br>
this end-piece, with a bearing interposed.<br>
The invention also concerns a loom fitted with a weave mechanism as previously described. Such a loom is more<br><br>
- 4 -<br>
economical, easier to configure and more reliable than the known looms.<br>
The invention also relates to a method of assembling a weave mechanism as previously described and, more specifically, a method that comprises steps consisting in:<br>
-	inserting the common cam drive shaft into the frame<br>
of the mechanism;<br>
-	moving at least one cam, in a direction globally<br>
perpendicular to a longitudinal axis of the shaft and<br>
into a volume defined between the free end of this<br>
shaft and a single-piece part of the frame, as far as<br>
to substantially align a central bore of this cam<br>
with this shaft;<br>
-	then moving this cam in a direction globally parallel<br>
with the longitudinal axis of the shaft and in a<br>
direction directed away from the aforementioned part<br>
of the frame, as far as to surround the shaft with<br>
this cam and<br>
-	detachably installing means forming an extension and<br>
support and connecting this end to an orifice made in<br>
the aforementioned part of the frame.<br>
The invention will be better understood and other advantages of the latter will appear more clearly in the light of the following description of two embodiments of a weave mechanism, a loom and a method according to its principle, given solely as an example and made with reference to the appended drawings in which:<br>
-	figure 1 is a principle partial schematic<br>
representation of a loom according to the invention,<br>
a part of the mechanism being cut away for the<br>
clarity of the drawing;<br>
-	figure 2 is a section on a larger scale along the<br>
line II-II in figure 1;<br>
-	figure 3 is a section similar to figure 2 when the<br>
mechanism is being assembled and<br><br>
— 5 -<br>
-figure 4 is a schematic skeleton representation, in partial section in a plane similar to that of figure 2, of a mechanism according to a second embodiment of the invention.<br>
The loom M shown in figure 1 comprises several heddle frames only one of which is visible m this figure with reference number 1. The various frames of the loom M operate in a vertical oscillation movement shown by the double arrow F1 and imparted by a cam mechanism 10 whose output levers 11 act on respectively connecting rods 12 associated with bent levers 13 and connected together and to the frames by connecting rods 14.<br>
The levers 11 are provided in numbers equivalent to the number of heddle frames 1 and are mounted so as to pivot, as shown by the double arrow F2, about the longitudinal axis X15 of a common shaft 15 supported by the frame 16 of the mechanism 10. The mechanism 10 also comprises several matching cams 18 each defining two tracks 18A and 18B on which press respectively rollers 19A and 19B carried by the levers 11.<br>
The cams 18 are frameed on a common shaft 20 that is supported by the frame 16 and a first end 2 0A thereof carries a bevel gear 21 designed to interact with a bevel pinion 22 and forming a reduction gear making it possible to drive the shaft 20 about its longitudinal axis X20<br>
To support the shaft 20 and the cams 18, the frame 16 is pierced by two orifices 16A and 16B of circular section and whose respective central axes are globally aligned with one another and with the axis X20 when the shaft 2 0 is in place in the frame 16. The orifices 16A and 16B are respectively formed in an intermediate rib 16C and m a side 16D of the frame 16 that are in a single piece.<br><br>
- 6 -<br>
A bearing 23 is placed in the orifice 16A and makes it possible to support the shaft 20 which extends either side of the rib 16C. From the orifice 16A, the shaft 20 extends in the direction of the orifice 16B over a length L20 that is strictly less than the distance D16 between the orifices 16A and 16B, that is to say the distance between the opposite faces of the parts 16C and 16D of the frame 16. This creates a space E shown shaded in figure 3 with a width 1E equal to the difference between the distance D16 and the length L20 •<br>
The space E may be used for installing the cams 18 on the shaft 2 0 because the width 1E is greater than the width l18 of the cams 18. Specifically, as shown in figure 3, a cam 18 may be inserted into the space E in the direction of the arrow F3, that is to say in a direction globally perpendicular to the axis X20, this cam 18 being inserted between the side 16D of the frame 16 and the free end 20B of the shaft 20. When the central bore 18C of the cam 18 is globally aligned with the axis X20, it is possible to move this cam in the direction of the arrow F4 in figure 3, that is to say m the direction of the rib 16C, so that this cam surrounds the end 20B of the shaft 20. It is then possible to angularly orient the cam 20 to align an axial drill hole of the latter provided for this purpose with an angular indexation rod 24 previously installed in the corresponding aligned orifices of the cams already installed on the shaft 20.<br>
When all the cams provided for the mechanism 10 have been installed on the shaft 20 as indicated hereinabove, the end 20B of the shaft 20 is connected to the side 16D of the frame 16 by means of an end-piece 40 and a sleeve 50 fixedly attached respectively to the shaft 20 and to the side 16D. The end-piece 40 is designed to extend the shaft 20 in the direction of the orifice 16B and it is provided with a groove 4 0C designed to interact with a tenon 20C provided on the<br><br>
— 7 —<br>
end 2 0B of the shaft 20, which makes it possible to make the elements 20 and 40 fast in rotation with each other and thus to secure the angular driving of the end-piece 40 by the shaft 20.<br>
The end-piece 4 0 comprises a skirt 40D designed to surround the end 20B of the shaft 2 0 and to press on the cam 18 closest to this end 8 while thus exerting on the stack of cams 18 a force represented by the arrows F5 and directed towards a ring 25 mounted on the shaft 20 and forming a shoulder. This force prevents the cams from rotating by a gripping effect.<br>
The end-piece 4 0 is immobilized on the shaft 2 0 by means of screws 41 received in drill holes 40E of the end-piece 40 and in tappings 20E of the shaft 20. Thus, by tightening the screws 41, the force F5 is exerted that makes it possible to grip the cams 18 and fixedly attach them in rotation to the shaft 20.<br>
The sleeve 50 is immobilized on the side 16D of the frame 16 by means of four screws 51 two of which are visible in figure 2 and which penetrate tappings situated radially on the outside of the orifice 16B. This sleeve 50 comprises a rim 50A pressing on the outer face of the side 16D and extends in the direction of the rib 16C to surround the end-piece 40 and the end 20B of the shaft 20. A series of rollers 60 is interposed between the outer radial surface 40F of the end-piece 40 and the inner radial surface 50F of the sleeve 50, which makes it possible to create a bearing to support the end 20D. Lugs 50G immobilized on the sleeve 50 by screws 50J make it possible to hold the rollers 60 in position.<br>
A stopper 50K is detachably mounted in the central opening of the sleeve 50 and makes it possible to mask the end-piece 40 and the screws 41.<br><br>
- 8 -<br>
Thus, the elements 40 to 60 make it possible to extend the shaft 20 so that its end is supported by the side 16D at the orifice 16B.<br>
It is understood that the bearing formed by the rollers 60 is not necessarily placed at the skirt 40D of the end-piece 40 and could be made in any location on the length of the end-piece 40.<br>
When the cam mechanism needs to be dismantled, particularly to replace certain cams, it is sufficient to remove the stopper 50K, then loosen the screws 51 and 41 to remove the elements 40 and 50 in order to again make the space E through which the cams 18 can be removed in a movement that is the reverse of that described here in above; then new cams can be installed.<br>
In the second embodiment of the invention shown in figure 4, the end-piece 4 0 extending the shaft 2 0 extends to the inside of the bore 16B where it is received with a bearing made of rollers 60 interposed. Screws 41 make it possible to fixedly attach the end-piece 40 to the end 20B of the shaft 20, this end-piece being associated with a washer 70 making it possible to exert on the cams 18 an axial force F5 for gripping them and fixedly attaching them rotationally.<br>
A stopper 50K makes it possible to isolate the end-piece 40 and the screws 4 1 from the outside.<br>
In the second embodiment a space E is also made thanks to which the cams 18 may be installed and removed as required.<br>
The features of the various embodiments described may be combined in the context of the present invention.<br><br>
