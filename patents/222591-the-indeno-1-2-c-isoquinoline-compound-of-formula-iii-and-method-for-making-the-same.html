				<td>ThE  Present invention relates to the indeno[l,2-c] isoquinoline compound and methed for making the same.<br>
This application is a continuation-in-part of U.S. Application No. 09/944,524, filed August 31;2001, which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.<br>
1.    FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to indenofl ,2-c]isoquinoline compounds; compositions comprising an indeno[l,2-c]isoquinoline compound; and methods for treating or preventing an inflammatory disease or ateperfusion disease.<br>
2.    BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Inflammatory diseases, such as arthritis, colitis, and autoimmune diabetes, typically manifest themselves as disorders distinct from those associated with, reperfusion diseases, e.g., stroke and heart attack, and can clinically manifest themselves as different entities. However, there can be common underlying mechanisms between these two types of disorders. In particular, inflammatory disease and reperfusion disease can induce proinflammatory cytokine and chemokine synthesis which can, in turn, result in production of cytotoxic free radicals such as nitric oxide and superoxide. NO and superoxide can react to form peroxynitrite (ONOO') (Szabo et al, Shock 6:79-88, 1996).<br>
The ONOO'-induced cell necrosis observed in inflammatory disease and in reperfusion disease involves the activation of the nuclear errzyme poly (ADP-ribose) synthetase (PARS). Activation of PARS is thought to be an important step in the cell-mediated death observed in inflammation and reperfusion disease (Szabo et al., Trends Pharmaco!. Sci. 19: 287-98, 1998).<br>
A number of PARS inhibitors have been described in the art. See, e.g., Banasik et al.., J. Biol. Chem., 267:1569-75, 1992, and Banasik et al., Mol. Cell. Biochem., 138:185-97, 1994; WO 00/39104; WO 00/39070; WO 99/59975; WO 99/59973: WO 99/11649; WO 99/11645; WO 99/11644; WO 99/11628; WO 99/11623; WO 99/11311; WO 00/42040; Zhang et al., Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun., 278:590-98,2000; White et al.., J. Med. Chem., 43 :4084-4097, 2000; Griffin et al., J. Med. Chem., 41:5247-5256, 1998; Shinkwin et al., Bioorg. Med. Chem., 7:297-308, 1999; and Soriano et al., Nature Medicine, 7:108-113, 2001. Adverse effects associated with administration of PARS inhibitors have been discussed in Milan et al, Science, 223:589-591,1984.<br><br><br><br>
Indeno[l,2-c)isoquinoline derivatives have been previously discussed in the<br>
art. For example, cytotoxic non-camptothecin topoisomerase I inhibitors are reported in<br>
Cushman et al, J. Med. Chem., 43:3688-3698, 2000 and Cushman et al., J. Med. Chem.<br>
42:446-57, 1999; indeno[l,2-c]isoquinolines are reported as antineoplastic agents in<br>
Cushman et al, WO 00/21537; and as neoplasm inhibitors in Hrbata et al, WO 93/05023.<br>
Syntheses of indeno[l,2-c]isoquinoline derivatives have been reported. For example,<br>
see Wawzoneke/a/.,Org. Prep. Proc. Int. 14:163-8,1982; Wawzoneke/a/.,Can. J. Chem.<br>
59:2833, 1981; Andoi et al, Bull. Chem. Soc. Japan, 47:1014-17, 1974; Dusemund et al,<br>
Arch. Pharm (Weinheim, Ger.), 3 17:381-2, 1984; and Lai et al., Indian J. Chem., Sect. B,<br>
388:33-39, 1999.<br>
There remains, however, a need in the art for compounds useful for treating or<br>
preventing inflammatory diseases or reperfusion diseases.<br>
Citation of any reference in Section 2 of this application is not an admission that the<br>
reference is prior art.<br>

The invention also includes methods for treating, preventing, or otherwise inhibiting<br>
reperfusion disease in a subject in need of treatment, prevention, or inhibition thereof. The<br>
method comprises administering an Indeno[l,2-c]isoquinoline Compound in an amount<br>
sufficient to treat, prevent or inhibit reperfusion disease in the subject. Reperfusion refers to<br>
the process whereby blood flow in the blood vessels is resumed following ischemia, such as<br>
occurs following constriction or obstruction of the vessel. Reperfusion disease can result<br>
following a naturally occurring episode, such as a myocardial infarction, stroke, or during a<br>
surgical procedure where blood flow in vessels is intentionally or unintentionally blocked.<br>
In some embodiments, the subject is administered an effective amount of an<br>
Indeno[l ,2-c]isoquinoline Compound.<br>

preventing an inflammatory disease or a reperfusion disease, or for inhibiting PARS<br>
activity, or more than one of these activities. The compositions can be suitable for internal<br>
use and comprise an effective amount of an Indeno[l,2-c]isoquinoline Compound and a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The Indeno[l,2-c]isoquinoline Compounds are<br>
especially useful in that they demonstrate very low peripheral toxicity or, no peripheral<br>
toxicity.<br>
The Indeno[l,2-c]isoquinoline Compounds can be administered in amounts that are<br>
sufficient to treat or prevent an inflammatory disease or a reperfusion disease and/or prevent<br>
the development thereof in subjects.<br>
Administration of the Indeno[l,2-c]isoquinoline Compounds can be accomplished<br>
via any mode of administration for therapeutic agents. These modes include systemic or<br>
local administration such as oral, nasal, parenteral, transdermal, subcutaneous, vaginal,<br>
buccal, rectal or topical administration modes.<br>
Depending on the intended mode of administration, the compositions can be in<br>
solid, semi-solid or liquid dosage form, such as, for example, injectables, tablets,<br>
suppositories, pills, time-release capsules, elixirs, tinctures, emulsions, syrups, powders,<br>
liquids, suspensions, or thelike, preferably in unit dosages and consistent with conventional<br>
pharmaceutical practices. Likewise, they can also be administered in intravenous (both<br>
bolus and infusion), intraperitoneal, subcutaneous or intramuscular form, all using forms<br>
well known to those skilled in the pharmaceutical arts.<br>

dissolved in or mixed with a pharmaceutically acceptable solvent such as, for example,<br>
water, saline, aqueous dextrose, glycerol, ethanol, and the like, to thereby form an injectable<br>
isotonic solution or suspension.<br>
The Indeno[l,2-c]isoquinoline Compounds can be also formulated as a suppository<br>
that can be prepared from fatty emulsions or suspensions; using polyalkylene glycols such<br>
as propylene glycol, as the carrier.<br>
The Indeno[l,2-c]isoquinoline Compounds can also be administered in the form of<br>
liposome delivery systems, such as small unilamellar vesicles, large unilamellar vesicles<br>
and multilamellar vesicles. Liposomes can be formed from a variety of phospholipids,<br>
containing cholesterol, stearylamine or phosphatidylcholines. In some embodiments, a film<br>
of lipid components is hydrated with an aqueous solution of drug to a form lipid layer<br>
encapsulating the drug, as described in United States Patent No. 5,262,564.<br>
Indeno[l,2-c]isoquinoline Compounds can also be delivered by the use of<br>
monoclonal antibodies as individual carriers to which the Indeno[l,2-c]isoquinoline<br>
Compound molecules are coupled. The Indeno[l,2-c]isoquinoline Compounds can also be<br>
coupled with soluble polymers as targetable drug carriers. Such polymers can include<br>
polyvinylpyrrolidone, pyran copolymer, polyhydroxypropylmethacrylamide-phenol,<br>
polyhydroxyethylaspanamidephenol, or polyethyleneoxidepolylysine substituted with<br>
palmitoyl residues. Furthermore, the Indeno[l,2-c]isoquinoline Compounds can be coupled<br>
to a class of biodegradable polymers useful in achieving controlled release of a drug, for<br>
example, polylactic acid, polyepsilon caprolactone, polyhydroxy butyric acid,<br>
polyorthoesters, polyacetals, polydihydropyrans, polycyanoacrylates and cross-linked or<br>
amphipathic block copolymers of hydrogels.<br>
Parental injectable administration is generally used for subcutaneous, intramuscular<br>
or intravenous injections and infusions. Injectables can be prepared in conventional forms,<br>
either as liquid solutions or suspensions or solid forms suitable for dissolving in liquid prior<br>
to injection.<br>
One embodiment for parenteral administration employs the implantation of a<br>
slow-release or sustained-released system, according to U.S. Pat. No. 3,710,795,<br>
incorporated herein by reference.<br>

Method II: To a stirred suspension of 3-(4-morpholino)-l-propylamine (4.250 g) in<br>
CH2C12 (100 mL) was added 7 (1.950 g, 5.89 mmol) and the resulting mixture was stirred<br>
for 5 minutes. Subsequently, triethylamine (3 mL) was added and the reaction mixture was<br>
stirred for 24 hr at room temperature. After this time the precipitate was collected and<br>
washed with MeOH (2 x 100 mL) and the crude solid product transferred to a round bottom<br>
flask. This material was diluted with MeOH (200 mL), heated to reflux for 30 min. and<br>
filtered while still warm. The resulting filtercake was washed with MeOH (200 mL) to<br>
provide the desired product as the free base of 81 (1.460 g, 56%).<br>

Example 2. Effect of Illustrative Indeno[l,2-c]isoquinoline Compounds on PARS<br>
activity in cultured macrophages, using a whole-cell based assay and a purified<br>
enzyme assay.<br>
Demonstration of illustrative Indeno[l,2-c]isoquinoline Compounds' ability to<br>
inhibit PARS and prevent peroxynitrite induced cytotoxicity was shown using methods<br>
described in Virag et al., BrJPharmacol 1999, 126(3):769-77; and Immunology 1998,<br>
94(3):345-55. RAW mouse macrophages were cultured in DMEM medium with high<br>
glucose and supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were used at 80%<br>
confluence in 12-well plates. Cells were pretreated with various concentrations (100 nM -1<br>
uM) of an Indeno[l,2-c]isoquinoline Compound for 10 min. Peroxynitrite, a prototypical<br>
oxidant which induces DNA single strand breakage, was used to induce PARS activation.<br>
Peroxynitrite was diluted in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) (pH 11.0) and added to the<br>
cells in a bolus of 50 uJ. Cells were then incubated for ^0 min. Peroxynitrite was<br>
decomposed by incubation for 30 min at pH 7.0, used as a control, and failed to influence<br>
the parameter studied. After the 20 min incubation, the cells were spun, the medium was<br>
aspirated and the cells were resuspended in 0.5 ml assay buffer (56 mM HEPES pH 7.5, <br>
mM KC1, 28 mM NaCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 0.01 % w/v digitonin and 0.125 \M NAD+ and 0.5<br>
uCi/ml 3H-NAD*). Following an incubation in assay buffer, (10 min at 37 °C), PARS<br>
activity was measured as follows: 200 ul ice cold 50 % w/v TCA was added and the<br>
samples were incubated for 4 hours at 4°C. Samples were then spun (10 min @ 10,000 g)<br>
and pellets washed twice with ice cold 5 % w/v TCA and solubilized overnight in 250 ul 2<br>
% w/v SDS/0.1 N NaOH at 37°C. The contents of the tubes were added to 6.5 ml<br>
ScintiSafe Plus scintillation liquid (Fisher Scientific) and radioactivity was determined<br>
using a liquid scintillation counter (Wallac, Gaithersburg, MD). The results shown in Table<br>
1 demonstrate that the illustrative Indeno[l,2-c]isoquinoline Compounds significantly and<br>
dose-dependently inhibit the activation of PARS in the macrophage assay.<br>

PARS activation in cultured murine macrophages.<br>
Compound No.<br>
(Figure removed)<br>
The potency of inhibition on purified PARS enzyme was subsequently determined<br>
for selected Indeno[l,2-c]isoquinoline Compounds, and the potency was compared with<br>
that of 3-aminobenzamide, a prototypical benchmark PARS inhibitor. The assay was<br>
performed in 96 well ELISA. plates according to instructions provided with a commercially<br>
available PARS inhibition assay kit (Trevigen, Gaithersburg, MD). Briefly, wells were<br>
coated with 1 mg/mL histone (50 ul/well) at 4°C overnight. Plates were then washed four<br>
times with PBS and then blocked by adding 50 ul Strep-Diluent (supplied with the kit).<br>
After incubation (Ih, room temperature), the plates were washed four times with PBS.<br>
Appropriate dilutions of PARS inhibitors were combined with 2x PARS cocktail (1.95 mM<br>
NAD+, 50 uM biotinylated NAD+ in 50 mM TR1S pH 8.0, 25 mM MgCl2) and high specific<br>
activity PARS enzyme (both were supplied with the kit) in a volume of 50 ul. The reaction<br>
was allowed to proceed for .'JO min at room temperature. After 4 washes in PBS,<br>
incorporated biotin was detected by peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin (1:500 dilution) and<br>
TAGS Sapphire substrate. The assay confirmed the results of the macrophage-based PARS<br>
assay. For example, the PARS inhibitor 81 exerted 50% inhibition of PARS activity in this<br>
assay at 3 nM, and thus was approximately 50,000 times more potent than the reference<br>
compound 3-aminobenzamide.<br>

models of inflammatory disease and reperfusion disease<br>
a: Effects of illustrative Indeno[l,2-c]isoquinoline Compounds on in vitro cell disease<br>
models<br>
In additional in vitro studies in isolated thymocytes, cells were exposed to<br>
peroxynitrite or hydrogen peroxide (toxic oxidant species) to induce cytotoxicity. In this<br>
system the toxicity is, at least in part, related to activation of the nuclear enzyme PARS. In<br>
this oxidant-stimulated thymocyte assay (described, in detail, in Virag et al., Immunology<br>
94(3):345-55, 1998), the compounds tested prevented the oxidant-induced suppression of<br>
the viability of the cells and did so at the low nanomolar concentration range. An example<br>
of this response (Compound 81) is shown in Table 2. This assay represents an in vitro<br>
model of cells dying because of exposure to pro-oxidant species, as it occurs in during the<br>
reperfusion of ischemic organs.<br>

b: Effect of illustrative Indeno[l,2-c]isoquinoline Compounds on in vivo models of<br>
inflammatory diseases<br>
In order to substantiate the efficacy of the compounds in inflammatory diseases, the<br>
effect of illustrative Indeno[l,2-c]isoquinoline Compounds was demonstrated in a systemic<br>
inflammatory model induced by bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), which is reported to be<br>
responsible for causing reperfusion diseases and inflammatory diseases such as septic shock<br>
and systemic inflammatory response syndrome in animals (see Parrillo, N. Engl. J. Med.,<br>
328:1471-1478 (1993) and Lamping, J. Clin. Invest. 101:2065-2071 (1998). In a series of<br>
experiments, mice were pretreated with intraperitoneal injection of 0.1 and 1 mg/kg of<br>
compounds 81, 8p and 8j, and LPS at 10 mg/kg was injected i.p., and TNF-alpha was<br>
measured in the plasma at 90 minutes. As shown in Table 3, all compounds substantially<br>
reduced TNF production, indicative of the compounds' anti-inflammatory activity.<br>
Table 3. Reduction of LPS induced TNF production by 0.1 -1 mg/kg intraperitoneal<br>
injection of the PARS inhibitor compounds 8L, 8P and 8J in mice in vivo<br>
8j (0.1<br>
(Figure removed)<br>
All compounds markedly suppressed LPS induced TNF production when compared<br>
to control.<br>
At high doses, LPS causes multiple organ dysfunction resembling of septic shock,<br>
and ultimately death (in part because of the early release of TNF-alpha). Similarly, in a<br>
model induced by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP), the live bacteria that derive from the<br>
intestinal flora induce systemic inflammation and shock. Agents that inhibit inflammatory<br>
mediator production, PARS activation, and cell death in this model prevent mortality<br>
induced by LPS or CLP. In experiments with Balb/c mice, injection of 100 mg/kg LPS<br>
intraperitoneally caused death in 50% of the animals over 24 h, whereas treatment of the<br>
animals with 3 mg/kg/day of compound 81 reduced the endo toxin-induced mortality to 10%<br>
under the same experimental conditions. In response to CLP induced shock, compound 81<br>
(3 mg/kg/day) caused a reduction in the mortality from 100% death to 60% death over 24<br>
hours.<br>
The data demonstrating the reduction of TNF production by illustrative Indeno[l,2-<br>
c]isoquinoline Compounds in animals subjected to an inflammation model, coupled with<br>
the fact that TNF production is an important trigger of inflammation in various<br>
inflammatory diseases (such as, for example, colitis, arthritis and neuroinflammation and<br>
shock) indicate that the Indeno[l,2-cjisoquinoline Compounds have therapeutic effects in<br>
various systemic and local inflammatory diseases, including the rejection of transplanted<br>
organs, which entails both an inflammatory disease component and a reperfusion disease<br>
component and, accordingly, are useful for treating or preventing an inflammatory disease<br>
or a reperfusion disease.<br>
c: Effect of illustrative Indeno[l,2-c]isoquinoline Compounds on in vivo models of<br>
reperfusion disease<br>
In order to substantiate the efficacy of the Indeno[l,2-c]isoquinoline Compounds in<br>
ischemia-reperfusion conditions, the effect of an illustrative Indeno[l,2-c]isoquinoline<br>
Compound in a mouse model of ischemic and reperfused gut was tested. The superior<br>
mesenteric artery was occluded for 45 min, followed by a reperfusion for 1 h. Following<br>
the end of the reperfusion, gut permeability was measured with the FD4 method in evened<br>
gut sacks (Liaudet et al; Shock 2000, 14(2):134-41). Ischemia-reperfusion increased the<br>
permeability of the gut from 11 ± 4 to 216 ± 27 ml/min/cm2, indicative of severe damage of<br>
the reperfused gut. Treatment with Compound 81 (3 mg/kg i.v., injected 10 min. prior to<br>
initiation of reperfusion) reduced the increase in the permeability of the gut by<br>
approximately 73%, indicating a marked maintenance of the gut function. The ischemiareperfusion<br>
studies in the gut were associated with a 80% mortality over 12 hours, whereas<br>
only 15% mortality was noted in the animals treated with 81.<br>
In another set of experiments, the effect of Compound 81 in a rat model of middle<br>
cerebral artery occlusion/reperfusion was assayed as described in Abdelkarim et al, IntJ<br>
Mol Med 2001, 7(3):255-60. Occlusion lasted for 2 hours, followed by reperfusion for 24<br>
hours. Infarct size was quantified with tetrazolium staining. Compound 81 was<br>
administered at 3 mg/kg/day in 3 divided intraperitoneally injected doses, the first dose<br>
being administered 10 min. prior to the initiation of reperfusion. There was an<br>
approximately 80% reduction in the degree of cortical necrosis and neuronal death in the<br>
animals administered with 81, when compared to vehicle-treated controls. This protection<br>
also translated into functional benefit, such as neurological improvements in the PARS<br>
inhibitor treated group.<br>
These data indicate that the Indeno[l,2-c]isoquinoline Compounds have therapeutic<br>
effects in various systemic and local conditions of reperfusion diseases, including the<br>
rejection of transplanted organs, which entails both an inflammatory disease component and<br>
a reperfusion disease component and, accordingly, are useful for treating or preventing an<br>
inflammatory disease or a reperfusion disease.<br>
d: Effect of illustrative Indeno[l,2-c]isoquinoline Compounds in a diabetes model<br>
PARS inhibitors and PARS deficiency are known to reduce the development of<br>
diabetes and the incidence of diabetic complications (Mabley et al., Br J Pharmacol. 2001,<br>
133(6):909-9; and Soriano et al., Nat Med. 2001, 7(1): 108-13). In order to substantiate the<br>
efficacy of the Indeno[l,2-c]isoquinoline Compounds in a diabetes model, a single highdose<br>
streptozotocin model of diabetes was conducted as previously described. Briefly,<br>
160 mg/kg streptozotocin was injected to mice treated with vehicle or with illustrative<br>
Indeno[l,2-c]isoquinoline Compounds intraperitoneally (3 mg/kg) and 3 days later blood<br>
sugar levels were determined using a blood glucose meter. The data shown in Table 4<br>
demonstrate that the illustrative Indeno[l ,2-c]isoquinoline Compounds attenuate the<br>
streptozotocin-induced onset of diabetes as they reduce the hyperglycemia.<br>

intraperitoneal injection of the PARS inhibitor compounds 81, 8p and 8j in mice in<br>
vivo<br>
(Figure removed)<br>
Accordingly, the Indeno[l,2-c]isoquinoline Compounds are useful for treating or<br>
preventing diabetes or a diabetic complication.<br>
