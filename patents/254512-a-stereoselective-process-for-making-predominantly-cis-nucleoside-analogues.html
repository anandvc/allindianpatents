				<td>The present invention relates to a stereoselective process for making predominantly cis nucleosides or nucleoside analogues.<br>
The present invention relates to a novel process for producing cis nucleosides or nucleoside analogues and derivatives of formula (A):<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein Rl is a pyrimidine base or a pharmaceutically acceptable derivative thereof and Q is oxygen, carbon or sulphur.<br>
Classes of compounds of formula (A), particularly the 2-substituted<br>
4-substituted 1,3-oxathiolanes have been found to have present antiviral<br>
activity. In particular, these compounds have been found to act as<br>
potent inhibitors  of	HIV-1   replication in T-lymphocytes  over a<br>
prolonged period of time with less cytotoxic side effects than compounds known in the art (see Belleau et al (1993) Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. Vol. 3, No. 8, pp. 1723-1728). These compounds have also been found active against 3TC-resistant HIV strains (see Taylor et al (200) Antiviral Chem. Chemother. Vol 11, No. 4, pp. 291-301; Stoddart et al (2000) Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. Vol. 44, No. 3, pp. 783-786). These compounds are also useful in prophylaxis and treatment of hepatitis B virus infections.<br>
Methods for the preparation of these compounds have been disclosed in PCT publications WO 92/08717 and WO 95/29176 as well as in publications by Belleau et al (1993) Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. Vol. 3, No. 8, pp. 1723-1728; Wang et al (1994) Tetrachedron Lett. Vol. 35, No. 27, pp. 4739-<br><br><br><br>

(Figure Removed)<br><br><br>
The various steps as illustrated in Scheme 1 may be briefly described as follows:<br>
Step 1: The sulfoxide of formula (B) may be obtained using several methods including those disclosed in PCT publications WO 92/08717 and WO 95/29176, J. Med. Chem. 38(1) 1-4 (1995), Tetrahedron Lett. 35(27) 4739-4742 (1994), Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 3 (8) 1723-1728 (1993) and Eur. J. Org. Chem. 6:1455-1458 (1999).  The sulfoxide may be a single enantiomer or a mixture of enantiomers including but not limited to a racemic mixture.<br>
The sulfoxide of formula (B) is coupled with base Rl. The base Rl may be previously protected , for example silylated (or silylated in situ) pyrimidine base or pharmaceutically acceptable derivative may be used.  The coupling reaction takes place in the presence of a tertiary amine, a Lewis acid of formula (C) and catalytic amounts of<br>
an element of groups IB or IIB in a suitable coupling solvent to give the cis/trans pyrimidine nucleoside of formula (D).  In the resulting intermediate of formula (D), the cis isorner predominates over the trans isomer in a ratio equal to greater than 2 to 1.  The ratio of cis to trans isomer is inversely proportional to the temperature of the reaction temperature.  The coupling reaction may be preformed at or below room temperature.  The temperature of the coupling step may be between about 0 degrees C and about - 50 degrees C.<br>
If a silylated base is used, adequate silylating agent may include t-butyldimethylsilyl triflate 1,1,1,3,3,3 hexamethyldisilazane, TMSI, N,0,bis(TMS) acetonide and trimethylsilyl triflate.

Step 2: The cis/trans pyrimidine 1,3-oxathiolane nucleoside of formula (D) is dissolved in a suitable deprotection solvent in the presence of adequate amounts of a deprotection agent to yield the cis nucleosides or nucleoside analogues or derivatives of formula (A).  The deprotection step is preformed at a temperature below the boiling point of the suitable deprotection solvent.  The reaction temperature of the deprotection step may be between - 30 degrees C and 60 degrees C.  The reaction may be preformed at a temperature between about 0 degrees C to about 35 degrees C.<br>
A deprotection suitable solvent favors the crystallization of the product of formula (A).  Suitable solvents include water, methanol, ethanol, toluene, tert-butyl methyl ether or combinations thereof.<br>

in the presence of adequate amounts of a deprotection agent to yield the cis nucleosides or nucleoside analogues or derivatives of formula (Ax) ,<br>
