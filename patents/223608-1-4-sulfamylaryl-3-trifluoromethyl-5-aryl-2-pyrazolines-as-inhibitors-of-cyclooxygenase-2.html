PYRAZOLINES AS INHIBITORS OF CYCLOOXYGENASE-2<br>
Cross-Reference to Related Application<br>
The benefit of the filing date of U.S. provisional patent<br>
application Ser. No. and 60/139,416, filed June 16,1999 is hereby claimed<br>
pursuant to 35 U.S.C. 119(e). The entire disclosure of the aforesaid<br>
provisional application is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The invention relates generally to anti-inflammatory drugs,<br>
and more particularly to novel compounds which inhibit the activity of<br>
cyclooxygenase-2.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
The metabolites of arachidonic acid, such as prostaglandins,<br>
lipoxygenases and thromboxane products are produced in a wide variety<br>
of tissues and play a key role in several biological responses.<br>
Prostaglandins mediate both beneficial and undesirable biological<br>
reactions. The production of prostaglandins induces pain, swelling, heat<br>
and redness which are characteristic features of inflammation. The chronic<br>
inflammation associated with prostaglandin production leads to the<br>
breakdown of the injured tissue and angiogenesis. In pathologic chronic<br>
inflammation, normal tissues can be destroyed and the new blood vessel<br>
formation can support growth of abnormal tissue. Prostaglandins are also<br>
important for normal physiological processes in different organs. In the<br>
stomach, prostaglandins protect mucosa from acid. They also regulate<br>
blood flow and salt-water balance in the kidney. Prostaglandins are also<br>
important in platelets aggregation and participate in memory and other<br>
cognitive functions.<br>
Prostaglandins are produced from cell membrane<br>
phospholipids by a cascade of enzymes. The enzymatic activities involve<br>
release of arachidonic acid from the cell membrane by phospholipase A2,<br>
followed by the conversion of arachidonic acid to a common prostaglandin<br>
precursor, PGH2, by cyclooxygenase (also called prostaglandin H<br>
synthase). PGH2 is finally converted to various types of prostaglandins<br>
(PGE,, PGE2, PGI2 or prostacyclin, PGF^ and thromboxane) by cellspecific<br>
synthases.<br>
Aspirin, and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs<br>
(NSAIDs) block the formation of prostaglandins by inhibiting<br>
cyclooxygenase activity. They have analgesic, antipyretic and antiinflammatory<br>
activities. However, chronic treatment with the available<br>
NSAIDs often leads to disruption of beneficial prostaglandin-mediated<br>
processes. The side effects associated with constant usage of NSAIDs<br>
include gastrointestinal (Gl) irritation and formation of life-threatening Gl<br>
ulcers.<br>
A dramatic advance in the field of inflammation research<br>
came with discovery of multiple enzymes for each step of the prostaglandin<br>
synthase cascade. The research suggested that in some situations, such<br>
as inflammation, cyclooxygenase was inducible. The cyclooxygenase<br>
known at the time, cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1), was clearly non-inducible<br>
or modulated by glucocorticoids. A second, inducible form of<br>
cyclooxygenase known as cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) was subsequently<br>
identified and cloned by several groups of investigators. COX-1 is the<br>
constitutive cyclooxygenase isoform and is mainly responsible for the<br>
synthesis of cytoprotective prostaglandins in the Gl tract and the synthesis<br>
of thromboxane which triggers platelet aggregation in blood platelets.<br>
COX-2 is inducible and short lived except in the case of certain tumors<br>
where it is constitutively activated. COX-2 expression is stimulated in<br>
response to endotoxins, cytokines, hormones, growth factors and mitogens.<br>
These observations suggest that COX-1 and COX-2 serve different<br>
physiological and pathophysiological functions. Indeed, it has been<br>
suggested that COX-1 is responsible for endogenous basal release of<br>
prostaglandins and hence is important to the physiological functions of<br>
prostaglandins such as Gl integrity and renal blood flow. On the other<br>
hand, it has been suggested that COX-2 is mainly responsible for the<br>
pathological effects of prostaglandins, where induction of the enzyme<br>
occurs in response to inflammatory agents, hormones, growth factors and<br>
cytokines. See, U.S. Pat. 5,604,253, incorporated herein by reference, for<br>
a discussion of the advantages of selective COX-2 inhibition. Principally,<br>
a selective COX-2 inhibitor is expected to possess similar antiinflammatory,<br>
antipyretic and analgesic properties to a conventional NSAID<br>
but with reduced potential for gastrointestinal toxicity, and a reduced<br>
potential for renal side effects.<br>
The differential tissue distribution of COX-1 and COX-2<br>
provides an approach to develop selective inhibitors for COX-2 with<br>
reduced effect on COX-1, thereby preventing gastric side effects.<br>
A number of selective COX-2 inhibitors have been reported.<br>
These include diaryl heterocyclics (Penning etal., J. Med. Chem, 40,1347-<br>
1365 (1997); acetoxyphenyl alkyl sulfides (Kalgutkar etal., J. Med. Chem,<br>
41,4800-4818 (1998); methane sulfonanilides (Li etal., J. Med. Chem, 38,<br>
4897-4905 (1995); and tricyclic inhibitor classes (Wilkerson etal., J. Med.<br>
Chem., 38, 3895-3901 (1995). U.S. Pat. 5,604,253 discloses Nbenzylindol-<br>
3-yl propanoic acid derivatives as cyclooxygenase inhibitors.<br>
What is needed are additional COX-2 inhibitors, particularly<br>
compounds which selectively inhibit the cyclooxygenase activity of COX-2<br>
over COX-1.<br>

-NCRe'M*<br>
and M is Na, K or Li, may be formed by reacting the above sulfonamide<br>
with an alkali hydroxide, selected from the group consisting of NaOH, KOH<br>
or LiOH.<br>
The following are general procedures for preparation of the formula<br>
I compounds or intermediates thereof:<br>
Procedure 1: Synthesis of trans-1,1,1-trifluoro-4-aryl-3-<br>
buten-2-one intermediate<br>
To a solution of 10% sodium hydroxide in ethanol (25 ml), 1,1,1-<br>
trifluoroacetone (10 mmol) is added and stirred at 15-20°C. To this a<br>
solution of the appropriate araldehyde (10 mmol)<br>
9<br>
where Z is defined as above, is added and stirred vigorously for 4 hrs. The<br>
temperature of the-reaction is maintained at 15-20°C throughout the<br>
reaction. The solution is then poured into ice water and acidified with<br>
concentrated hydrochloric acid. The resulting separated frans-1,1,1-<br>
trifluoro-4-aryl-3-buten-2-one of formula IV (X=CF3) is extracted with ether<br>
dried over anhydrous MgSO4. Evaporation of the dried ethereal layer yields<br>
the frans-1,1,1-trifiuoro-4-aryl-3-buten-2-one which is purified by<br>
recrystallization.<br>
Procedure 1 A: Alternative synthesis of frans-1,1,1-<br>
trifluoro-4-aryl-3-buten-2-one intermediate<br>
To a cooled solution of (-70°C) lithium diisopropylamide (10 mmol), diethyl<br>
methylphosphonate (5 mmol) is added; After the mixture is stirred for 30<br>
minutes at -70°C, N-phenyltrifluoroacetimidoyl chloride (5 mmol) is<br>
gradually added and stirring is continued at -70°C for 1 hour. The<br>
appropriate araldehyde (Smmol)<br>
o<br>
Z-CH<br>
where Z is defined as above, is added dropwise for 10 minutes. The<br>
resulting mixture is warmed to room temperature over 2 hours and then<br>
stirred overnight. Then 20 ml of dilute hydrochloric acid is added and<br>
stirred at room temperature for 4 hours. The solution is extracted thrice<br>
with diethyl ether (20 ml each time) and washed successively with 5%<br>
sodium bicarbonate and brine until the pH of the solution is 6. The ethereal<br>
layer is separated, dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and concentrated<br>
under reduced pressure to yield crude trans -1,1,1 -trifluoromethyl -4-aryl-3-<br>
buten-2-one. The product is purified either by column chromatography or<br>
by recrystallization.<br>
The appropriate 1,1,1-trihaloacetone can be substituted for 1,1,1-<br>
trifluoroacetone in Procedure 1 to provide othertrans-1,1,1-trihalo-4-aryl-3-<br>
buten-2-one intermediate. Similarly, other N-phenyltrihaloacetimidoyl<br>
chlorides can be substituted for N-phenyltrifluoroacetimidoyl chloride in<br>
Procedure 1A to produce other trans-1,1,1-trihalo-4-aryl-3-buten-2-one<br>
intermediates.<br>
Procedure 2: Synthesis of frans-1-(alkyl or optionally<br>
substituted aryl)-3-aryl-2-propen-1 -one<br>
intermediate<br>
To a solution of 10% sodium hydroxide in ethanol (25 ml), a ketone<br>
of the formula<br>
on<br>
CH3C-X<br>
wherein X is CrC6 alkyl (20 mmol), or a radical of formula II<br>
wherein R3 and R4 are defined as above (10 mmol), is added and stirred at<br>
15-20°C. To this a solution of the appropriate araldehyde (10 mmol)<br>
o<br>
2-CH<br>
where Z is defined as above, is added and stirred vigorously for 4 hours.<br>
The temperature of the reaction is maintained at 15-20°C throughout the<br>
reaction. The solution is then poured into ice water and acidified with<br>
concentrated hydrochloric acid. The resulting separated frans-1-(alkyl or<br>
optionally substituted aryl)-3-aryl-2-propen-1-one of formula IV (X - CrC6<br>
alkyl, or radical of formula II) is extracted with ether dried over anhydrous<br>
MgSO4. Evaporation of the dried ethereal layer yields the frans-1-(alkyl or<br>
optionally substituted aryl)-3-aryl-2-propen-1-one, which is purified by<br>
distillation or recrystallization.<br>
Procedures: Synthesis of 1-(4-sulfamylaryl)-3-<br>
trifluoromethyl-5-aryl-2-pyrazoline<br>
To a solution of a frans-1,1l1-trifluoro-4-aryl-3-butene-2-one (5<br>
mmol) of formula IV (X = CF3) in absolute methanol is added 4-sulfamyl<br>
phenyl hydrazine hydrochloride (6 mmol). The mixture is refluxed with<br>
15 stirring overnight on a hot plate with a stirrer. The solution is cooled and<br>
poured onto crushed ice and solid material is separated by filtration.<br>
Recrystallization of the solid material with appropriate solvent yields the<br>
pure 1-(4-sulfamylaryl)-3-trifluorornethyl-5-aryl-2-pyrazoline of formula la:<br>
Procedure4: Synthesis of 1-(4-sulfamylaryl)-3-<alkyl or></alkyl>
optionally substituted aryl)-5-aryl-2-<br>
pyrazoline<br>
To a solution of a frans-1-(alkyl or optionally substituted aryl)-3-aryl-<br>
2-propen-1-one (5 mmol) of formula IV in absolute methanol is added 4-<br>
sulfamyl phenyl hydrazine hydrochloride (6 mmol). The mixture is retluxed<br>
with stirring overnight on a hot plate with a stirrer. The solution is cooled<br>
and poured onto crushed ice and solid material is separated by filtration.<br>
Recrystallization of the solid material with appropriate solvent yields the<br>

pyrazoline (10 mmol) in tetrahydrofuran (40 ml), acetic anhydride (20<br>
mmol), 4-dimethylaminopyridine (10 mmol) and triethylamine (11 mmol) is<br>
added and stirred for 16 hours at room temperature. The reaction mixture<br>
is then poured into water (100 ml) and extracted with ethyl acetate. The<br>
ethyl acetate layer is separated, washed successively with water, brine and<br>
then dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. The dried organic layer is<br>
filtered and evaporated under reduced pressure to yield crude N-[4-(5-<br>
aryl-3-trif I uromethy I pyrazol in-1-y I) phenylsulfonyljacetamide.<br>

To a solution of N-[4-(5-aryl-3-trifluoromethylpyrazolin-1-yl)<br>
phenylsulfonyljacetamide (5 mmol) in ethanol (100ml), sodium hydroxide<br>
(5 mmol in 20 ml of water) is added and stirred for 5 hours. The solution<br>
is then concentrated in vacuum to give a solid hydrated sodium salt of 1-<br>
(4-sulfamylphenyl)-3-trifluoromethyl-5-aryl-2-pyrazoline.<br>
Salts of other sulfonamides may be prepared in the same manner<br>
by substituting the appropriate amide according to formula V as the starting<br>
compound.<br>

phenylsulfonyl]acetamides according to formula V (X = CrC6 alkyl or<br>
optionally substituted or di-substituted phenyl) are prepared according to<br>
Procedure 5, substituting the appropriate 1-(4-sulfamylphenyl)-3-(alkyl or<br>
optionally substituted phenyl)-5-aryl-2-pyrazoline for 1 -(4-sutfamylphenyl)-3-<br>
trifluoromethyl-5-aryl-2-pyrazoline as the staring material.<br>
In similar fashion, sulfonamides according to formula V (X = CrC6<br>
alkyl or optionally substituted or di-substituted phenyl), other than<br>
acetamides, may be prepared by substituting the appropriate anhydride for<br>
acetic anhydride in Procedure 5. These compounds may be converted to<br>
salts according to Procedure 6.<br>
The compounds of the invention preferably are characterized by a<br>
selectivity ratio for COX-2 inhibition over COX-1 inhibition of at least about<br>
50, more preferably at least about 100. COX inhibition may be determined<br>
in vitro by enzyme assays well-known to those skilled in the art, such as the<br>
enzyme assay method described later herein.<br>

The compounds of the present invention may be administered in the<br>
form of a pharmaceutical composition, in combination with a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The active ingredient in such<br>
formulations may .comprise from 0.1 to 99.99 weight percent. By<br>
"pharmaceutically acceptable carrier" is meant any carrier, diluent or<br>
excipient which is compatible with the other ingredients of the formulation<br>
and to deleterious to the recipient.<br>
The compounds of the invention may be administered to individuals<br>
(animals, most particularly mammals including humans) afflicted with any<br>
disorder characterized by undesirable prostaglandin production resulting<br>
from cyclooxygenase activity, particularly COX-2 activity ("cyclooxygenasemediated<br>
disorder"). In particular, the compounds of the invention are<br>
believed useful in treating inflamation and inflamation-related disorders, by<br>
administering to a subject having or susceptible to such inflamation or<br>
inflamation-related disorder and effective amount of a compound according<br>
to formula I. Inflamation is associated with a variety of disease conditions.<br>
For a list of such disease conditions treatable by cyclooxygenase inhibitors,<br>
and COX-2 inhibitors in particular, see U.S. Patents 5,604,253 and<br>
5,908,852, the entire disclosures of which are incorporated herein by<br>
reference. Such conditions include, for example, arthritis, including but not<br>
limited to rheumatoid arthritis, spondyloarthropathies, gouty arthritis,<br>
osteoarthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus and juvenile arthritis. Such<br>
conditions further include rheumatic fever, symptoms associated with<br>
influenza or other viral infections, common cold, low back and neck pain,<br>
dysmenorrhea, headache, toothache, sprains and strains, myositis,<br>

myocardial ischemia, and the like. The compounds of the invention are<br>
believed useful as antipyretics for the treatment of fever.<br>
In addition, compounds of the invention may inhibit cellular<br>
neoplastic transformations and metastatic tumor growth and hence can be<br>
used in the treatment of cancer. In particular, the present invention<br>
provides a method for treating or preventing a neoplasia that produces a<br>
prostaglandin in a subject in need of such treatment or prevention, the<br>
method comprises treating the subject with a therapeutically effective<br>
amount of a compound of formula I or V. The term "neoplasia" includes<br>
neoplasia that produce prostaglandins or express a cyclooxygenase,<br>
including both benign and cancerous tumors, growths and polyps.<br>
Neoplasias believed treatable with cyclooxygenase inhibitors are discussed<br>
in U. S. Pat. 5,972,986, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated<br>
herein by reference. The compounds may be used to inhibit the growth or<br>
an established neoplasm, i.e., to induce regression, or to prevent or delay<br>
the onset of the neoplasm.<br>
According to U.S. Pat. 5,972,986, neoplasias that produce<br>
prostaglandins, and which are therefore believed treatable with the<br>
compounds of the invention, include brain cancer, bone cancer, epithelial<br>
cell-derived neoplasia (epithelial carcinoma) such as basal cell carcinoma,<br>
adenocarcinoma, gastrointestinal cancer such as lip cancer, mouth cancer,<br>
esophageal cancer, small bowel cancer and stomach cancer, colon cancer,<br>
liver cancer, bladder cancer, pancreas cancer, ovary cancer, cervical<br>
cancer, lung cancer, breast cancer and skin cancer, such as squamous cell<br>
and basal cell cancers, prostate cancer, renal cell carcinoma, and other<br>
known cancers that effect epithelial cells throughout the body.<br>
The compounds of the invention may also be useful in the treatment<br>
of angiogenesis-mediated disorders. Thus, a method for treating, inhibiting<br>
or delaying the onset of an angiogenesis-mediated disorder in a subject is<br>
provided comprising administering to a subject in need of such treatment<br>
an effective amount of a compound according to the present invention.<br>
Angiogenesis-mediated disorders which may be treatable with<br>
cyclooxygenase inhibitors are discussed in U. S. Pat. 6,025,353, the entire<br>
disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. According to U. S.<br>
Pat. 6,025,353, such disorders include, for example, metastasis, comeal<br>
graft rejection, ocular neovascularization, retinal neovascularization,<br>
diabetic retinopathy, retrolental fibroplasia, neovascular glaucoma, gastric<br>
ulcer, infantile hemaginomas, angiofibroma of the nasopharynx, avascular<br>
necrosis of bone, and endometriosis.<br>
The compounds may be administered by any route, including oral<br>
and parenteral administration. Parenteral administration includes, for<br>
example, intravenous, intramuscular, intraarterial, intraperitoneal,<br>
intranasal, rectal, or subcutaneous administration. The active agent is<br>
preferably administered with a pharmaceuticaliy acceptable carrier selected<br>
on the basis of the selected route of administration and standard<br>
pharmaceutical practice.<br><br>
The active agent may be formulated into dosage forms according to<br>
standard practices in the field of pharmaceutical preparations. See<br>
Alphonso Gennaro, ed., Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 18th Ed.,<br>
(1990) Mack Publishing Co., Easton, PA. Suitable dosage forms may<br>
comprise, for example, tablets, capsules, solutions, parenteral solutions,<br>
troches, suppositories, or suspensions.<br>
For parenteral administration, the active agent may be mixed with<br>
a suitable carrier or diluent such as water, an oil, saline solution, aqueous<br>
dextrose (glucose) and related sugar solutions, or a glycol such as<br>
propylene glycol or polyethylene glycol. Solutions for parenteral<br>
administration preferably contain a water soluble salt of the active agent.<br>
Stabilizing agents, antioxidizing agents and preservatives may also be<br>
added. Suitable antioxidizing agents include sulfite, ascorbic acid, citric<br>
acid and its salts, and sodium EDTA. Suitable preservatives include<br>
benzalkonium chloride, methyl- or propyl-paraben, and chlorbutanol.<br>
For oral administration, the active agent may be combined with one<br>
or more solid inactive ingredients for the preparation of tablets, capsules,<br>
or other suitable oral dosage forms. For example, the active agent may be<br>
combined with carboxymethylcellulose calcium, magnesium stearate,<br>
mannitol and starch, and then formed into tablets by conventional tableting<br>
methods.<br>
The specific dose of compound according to the invention to obtain<br>
therapeutic benefit will, of course, be determined by the particular<br>
circumstances of the individual patient including, the size, weight, age and<br>
sex of the patient, the nature and stage of the disease, the aggressiveness<br>
of the disease, and the route of administration. For example, a daily<br>
dosage of from about 0.01 to about 150 mg/kg/day may be utilized. Higher<br>
or lower doses are also contemplated.<br>
The compounds of the present invention are optically active due to<br>
the presence of a chiral carbon atom at position 5 of the pyrazoline<br>
nucleus:<br>
SO2NH2<br>
Other chiral carbon atoms may also be present. The present invention is<br>
meant to comprehend diastereomers as well as their racemic and resolved,<br>
enantiomerically pure forms and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof.<br>
Isolated optical isomers may be purified from racemic mixtures by wellknown<br>
chiral separation techniques. According to one such method, a<br>
racemic mixture of a compound having the structure of formula I or V, or<br>
chiral intermediate thereof, is separated into 99% wt.% pure optical isomers<br>
by HPLC using a suitable chiral column, such as DA1CEL CHIRALPAK AD<br>
(Daicel Chemical Industries, Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). This column contains a<br>
packing of amylosetris(3,5-dimethylphenyl) carbamate coated on a 10 pm<br>
silica-gel substrate. The column has a size of 250 x 4.6 mm (L x I.D.). The<br>
column is operated according to the manufacturer's instructions. A flow<br>
rate should be maintained that will result in column pressures of less than<br>
430 psi (30 kg/cm2). A typical flow rate is 1.0 ml/min. The operating<br>
temperature range is 0°C - 40°C. The maximum operating pressure is<br>
1200 psi. One suitable mobile phase system is hexane/2-propanol (100/0<br>
to 0/100 v/v). A typical hexane/2-propanol mobile phase is hexane/2-<br>
propanol (90/10 v/v). Another suitable mobile phase system is<br>
hexane/ethanol (100/0 to 85/15 v/v), (40/60 to 0/100 v/v). Suitable mobile<br>
phase modifiers include N.N-diethylamine for a basic sample, and<br>
trifluoroacetic acid for an acidic sample.<br>
The practice of the invention is illustrated by the following nonlimiting<br>
examples.<br>

Cyclooxygenase Enzyme Assay<br>
Compounds were tested for inhibitory activity against COX-1 and<br>
COX-2. The compounds of Examples 1 and 24 had the highest selectivity<br>
for inhibiting COX-2.<br>
Cyclooxygenase activity of ovine COX-1 (Oxford Biomedical<br>
Research Inc.) and human recombinant COX-2 (Oxford Biomedical<br>
Research Inc.) was assayed by a thin layer chromatography (TLC) method<br>
as follows. All inhibitors were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide to a stock<br>
solution of 5mM. Human recombinant COX-2 (3 units) or ovine COX-1 (15<br>
units) was incubated with inhibitors at several concentrations in a solution<br>
containing 100 mM Tris-HCI, pH7.8, 500 uM phenol and hematin for 90<br>
to 120 minutes at room temperature (24°C). In controls, equal volumes of<br>
DMSO without drug were added to the incubation mixture. After incubation<br>
for 90-120 minutes, [1-14C] arachidonic acid (50uM, 51mCi/mmo!) (DuPont<br>
MEN) was added and incubated at 37°C for 2 minutes. The reaction was<br>
terminated by extraction with 1 ml of ethyl acetate. The ethyl acetate layer<br>
was transferred into a fresh tube and evaporated to dryness in a Speedvac<br>
vacuum dryer. The contents of the tubes were reconstituted in 20 ml of<br>
ethyl acetate and spotted on a TLC plate (J.T. Baker, Phillipsburg, NJ) and<br>
developed in a mobile phase containing chloroform/methanol (95:5) at4°C.<br>
Radiolabeled prostanoid compounds (the products of COX enzymatic<br>
reaction with radiolabeled arachidonic acid substrate) were quantitated with<br>
a radioactivity scanner (Fuji, Phosphorimager). The percentage of total<br>
products observed at different inhibitor concentrations was divided by the<br>
percentage of the products observed for protein samples pre incubated for<br>
the same time with DMSO. The results are shown in Table 4. The<br>
Example 1 and 2 compounds are more than one thousand times more<br>
active in inhibiting COX-2 compared to COX-1.<br>

Soft Agar Assay<br>
The Example 1 and 24 compounds were compared to the COX-2<br>
inhibitor celecoxib in inhibiting the growth of DLD-1 cells in soft agar. DLD-<br>
1 cells are human colorectal carcinoma cells that overexpress COX-2.<br>
DLD-1 cells grow in soft agar and form tumors in nude mice. The soft agar<br>
assay was performed as follows. A layer of bottom agar (8% noble agar)<br>
was placed onto 60 mm2 tissue culture dishes. The tumor cells were<br>
trypsinized from normal growth flasks while in exponential growth. The<br>
cells were counted by using a hemacytometer and 1.0 x 105 cells were<br>
placed into the top agar mixture containing growth medium, 4% noble agar<br>
and various concentrations of drugs. The concentration range was<br>
normally between 10 uM to 75 uM. The cells were not refed during the<br>
assay system; therefore, the cells were treated with one dose of the<br>
agents. The plates were stained 20 days later with a 0.05% (w/v) nitroblue<br>
tetrazolium solution (which stains only viable cells) for 48 hours. The<br>
results are shown in Fig. 1, the y-axis being the percent of cell colonies<br>
remaining in comparison to untreated control cells. Even at the highest<br>
concentration tested, celecoxib obtained only about partial inhibition,<br>
compared to 100% for the compounds of the invention.<br>
