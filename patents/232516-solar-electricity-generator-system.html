				<td>SOLAR ELECTRICITY GENERATOR<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention refers to photovoltaic solar power plants of large size.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention refers to devices for the direct conversion of solar energy into electric-<br>
ity, in contrast to indirect conversion involving elevated-temperature intermediary processes<br>
producing mechanical torque that is applied to rotary electrical generators. Large solar elec-<br>
tricity generators are known to be currently operating in California. All of the largest first con-<br>
centrate sunlight into high-temperature heat and thereafter, with methods known from com-<br>
bustion-heated power-stations, partially into electricity, the rest waste heat All currently op-<br>
erating solar power plants with utility-significant electrical-output cover huge tracts because<br>
their areal yield is below 3%. Their high cost and considerable height lead to wide east-west<br>
separation of concentrator modules. Their high cost is due to the masses of metal required<br>
for the wind-loads generated by the height while the height ironically enough, is required in<br>
order to extend the number of hours per day that each module operates without being shad-<br>
owed by its southern neighbors. Additional cost factors accrue from the high maintenance<br>
labor involved in solar thermal electrical generation.<br>
Large-scale photovoltaic plants have only recently become economically viable due<br>
to the steadily decreasing photovoltaic-cell costs and steadily increasing cell efficiency. But<br>
without concentration, covering huge tracts of land with banks of one-sun cells will result in<br>
large masses of exotic metals being deployed across the landscape, necessarily in large<br>
panels that require their own wind-resistant structures. The present invention offers great<br>
improvements over this prior art, due to the efficiency-advantages of concentrating sunlight<br>
on PV cells.<br>
Theoretically, some photovoltaic cells could convert nearly 50% of the irradiation di-<br>
rectly into electricity, and practically nearly 40% has already been achieved in laboratory<br>
tests, but both of these are for solar concentration. The prior art of solar concentration,<br>
however, leads back to the same excessive land utilization, due to the requirement for mod-<br>
ules to be separated. The air-cooled PV concentrators of the prior art are still expensive<br>
enough as to require all-day operation for practical payback, because their concentrations<br>
are only in the tens.<br>
The prior art suffers from impracticaily excessive land utilization, which is expressed<br>
by their low areal solar efficiency, defined as electricity out divided by sunlight hitting all the<br>
land needed by tine installation. The present invention offers an environmentally benign sys-<br><br>
tew of solar electricity generation that improves upon the aforementioned prior art with a<br>
compact, maintainable, resource-modest design that is easy to manufacture and install. By<br>
covering 87% of the set-aside land rather than 5%, far less acreage must be set aside per<br>
billion watts produced. The present invention offers highly scalable, compact solar-electricity<br>
installations with improved logistics of installation, maintenance, and control and improved<br>
economics of manufacturing and payback.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention therefore uses concentrated photovoltaic conversion of sunlight, in<br>
two-axis tracking of its direct component, optically focused to high concentration (about 400<br>
in the preferred embodiment described herein) and kept to high efficiency by integral water<br>
cooling.<br>
As disclosed further, the following measures are taken to approach levels of areal<br>
efficiency an order of magnitude above the prior art.<br>
1.	The optically active aperture will be a large fraction (near 90% areal utilization) of<br>
the ground surface. A novel two-axis tracking configuration is herein disclosed<br>
that attains this.<br>
2.	The irradiation on the photovoltaic cells will be several hundred suns, for operat-<br>
ing efficiency to approach ideal limits, but not so high (thousands of suns) as to<br>
shorten reliable lifetime.<br>
3.	The conversion will be performed by multi-junction cells, because their compo-<br>
nent layers can each specialize in a portion of the solar spectrum, which is the<br>
underlying reason for the aforementioned high ideal conversion efficiencies.<br>
4.	The highly non-uniform distribution of concentrated flux at the small round focal<br>
spot (thousands of suns) will be distributed more equably over the larger, square<br>
photovoltaic cell. Because lens focal length varies with wavelength, the focal<br>
spot is spectrally non-uniform as well, with substantially wider focal spots at<br>
400nm and 1100 nm, than at the flux-weighted median refractive index of 1.492.<br>
Series-connected multi-junction cells, however, work best when the entire cell<br>
has the same spectral balance of concentrated solar flux received.<br>
5.	Because efficiency declines with temperature elevation, there will be a heat sink<br>
to remove fierce levels of unconverted solar heat, effective enough that the tem-<br>
perature difference between the bottom of the photovoltaic cell and the heat sink<br>
is only a few °C. At hundreds of suns, this means water cooling.<br>
6.	Two-axis tracking of the direct component of solar-radiation will be cost-<br>
effectively implemented while retaining low overall height.<br><br>
A further requirement for competitive large-scale solar electricity production is<br>
the enhanced cost-effectiveness over prior-art solar-energy conversion<br>
systems. The present invention makes this possible by:<br>
a)	Reduced material mass per watt, by using the buoyancy of the<br>
concentrators to support horizontal tracking by floating on the<br>
cooling water,<br>
b)	Minimal height of the system (literally knee-high) so that there is<br>
little vulnerability to the extremes of wind,<br>
c)	Use of small photovoltaic cells, for which the transfer of the solar<br>
electricity requires only short leads to a low-resistance common<br>
bus.<br>
d)	Shortfocal-length concentrating lenses and kaleidoscopic mixing<br>
rods, combined with natural-convection water-cooling, assure<br>
optimal cell-operation.<br>
The invention fulfills all these requirements by the features of the invention.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
Figure 1 shows in schematic presentation a vertical section through concentrators<br>
positioned in troughs 1, covered by lenses 2 which concentrate parallel monochromatic rays<br>
3 at focal spot 4. The troughs are supported on water body 5. The troughs are kept at a dis-<br>
tance of only a few millimeters from each other by traverses 6. For tracking in solar eleva-<br>
tion, the troughs can pivot around the horizontal geometric axis 7. The pivoting is controlled<br>
by sun-tracking sensors and is based on pneumatically driven balancing torques. By pump-<br>
ing water from ballast compartment 8 into ballast compartment 9, the two of which pneu-<br>
matically inter-communicate via tube-shaped traverse 6, a buoyancy-torque makes each<br>
trough pivot upward to keep lens 2 aimed directly at the climbing sun, until it has reached its<br>
highest position at noon. Thereafter blower 10 creates positive pressure in ballast compart-<br>
ment 9 through traverse 6, so that water flows back from ballast compartment 9 into ballast<br>
compartment 8. This causes the trough during the afternoon hours to pivot the lens down-<br>
ward. The angle of traverse is proportional to the positive or negative pressure.<br>
Figure 2 shows skeleton 20 of a floating platform with multiple troughs 21, each<br>
comprising 12 concentrator lenses. The skeleton 20 comprises floating ring 22, which forms<br>
a unit with floating traverses 6' and vertically joins members 23 to traverses 6'. Vertical<br>
bearing 24 is arranged in the center of the platform and is connected to the ground. Ring 22<br>
can have teeth 28 (as on a tooth-belt) that will be turned by disc 29, which is driven by an<br>
electric motor. The platform revolves around the vertical axis of the platform at the azimuthai<br>
angular velocity of the sun, controlled by a sun finder. Concentrating lenses 2' thus point at<br>
the sun in both horizontal and vertical axes. During the night the platform turns back into the<br>
morning position, but on breezy nights with the troughs aimed into the wind for enhanced<br>
cooling of the water.<br>
Figure 3 shows a group of platforms of a solar farm arranged in a close-packed man-<br>
ner suitable for any number of platforms. In such a case of multiple platforms, azimuihai-<br>
tracking drive will be done by pneumatic-tire guiding-wheels 30 arranged interstitially be-<br>
tween three platforms. Each fifth such wheel 31 is driven by an electric motor, the torque of<br>
which is transferred to outer rings 22'. Also in this case the rings 22' can have teeth to en-<br>
gage the teeth of guides 30. Footbridges 34 run above guides 30 to allow personnel access<br>
for maintenance. Below each platform 20' of the solar farm there is a shallow body of water,<br>
upon which it floats. This enclosed pond is protected from evaporation by layer of oil atop it<br>
Into this water layer the waste heat of the photovoltaic cells is conducted. The cooling of the<br>
water layer is done by its exposure to the outside air. During hours when the sun is too low,<br>
and especially at night, platform 20 will be turned so the trough rows face into the direction of<br>
the wind, giving it good access to the pond water.<br><br>
Such a solar farm can also be placed on natural bodies of water. If the bottom of a<br>
lake is too deep, the axes 33 of the guiding wheels 30 will be connected to each other by<br>
rods and the combined guiding wheels 30 will be attached via anchor apparatus to the bot-<br>
tom. Also, numerous industrial installations have large aeration ponds suitable for dual use<br>
with the present invention, as long as the troughs are made of a low-corrosion material.<br>
Figure 4 shows troughs 1 in transverse cross-section, to show their interiors, where<br>
the conversion of the sun's irradiation takes place. These troughs float on water layer 5 At<br>
low sun elevations trough V displaces an amount of water defined by dotted line 40 and<br>
those portions of trough-walls 54 lying below it At each elevation angle geometric circle 41<br>
has tangentto the plane of the water surface. Dotted lines from 40 through 42 define that<br>
plane at higher solar elevations, all of them tangent to circle 41. The distance 61 of the<br>
troughs 1 and 1' from each other results from the width of the lenses 2" plus a gap of mini-<br>
mal width between the troughs. At elevation angle shown of 24°, rim 47 of protruding guard<br>
frame 48 touches the protruding part 49 of the adjacent trough. Relative to bisecting line 45,<br>
optical axis 46 of lens 2 is moved downwards. This optical axis intersects the center of the<br>
entrance plane of radiation-homogenizer 43. The highly concentrated pencil of concentrated<br>
solar rays will enter rod 43 and by loss-free total internal reflection make its way to photo-<br>
voltaic cell 4'. Due to the kaleidoscopic action of these internal reflections, the spatial distri-<br>
bution of the sunlight on 4' will having become more even. Photovoltaic cell 4' is in good<br>
thermal contact with extruded rod 50, positioned to stay below water surface 5' at all solar-<br>
elevation angles of trough 1'. At one end, hose 52 opens to the outside air and on the other<br>
end it is closed. Wire grid 53 runs parallel to peripheral ray 39 and prevents hose 52 from<br>
entering the pyramid within rays 39 of the concentrator lens.<br>
In response to meteorological increases in air pressure, hose 52 fills with outside air.<br>
This measure ensures that the compartment enclosed by lenses 2', walls 54 and 55, and the<br>
end wall always has the same air-pressure as the outside air, minimizing uncontrolled air-<br>
exchange with ambient To dry the air entering the interior, a recycling dessicator is provided<br>
in canister 37 on hose 52. Dry interior air is essential because multi-junction-cells are hygro-<br>
scopic.<br>
Figure 5 shows a view of the trough from the side facing the sun. At end plates 56<br>
and 56' the troughs have stub-shafts 57, and can be tilted thereupon around horizontal geo-<br>
metric axis 58. The position of the axis 58 is chosen for zero buoyancy-torque at ail opera-<br>
tional tilting angles. Lens 2' has on its inner side a multiplicity of refracting grooves 59 in the<br>
central half of the lens and peripherally about it are TIR grooves 60, enabling the short focal<br>
length required by such a zero-torque trough-shape. As shown in Figure 4, only with such a<br>
short focal length, as represented by dotted line 46, can inter-trough distance 61 be barely<br><br>
larger than the trough's width, for close to 100% fiil-factor. Since the troughs are supported<br>
by floating in water, their walls need less materia* thickness than would be necessary to pre-<br>
vent twist deformation when out of the water. In order to save on the expense of corrosion-<br>
resistant wall material, diagonal bracing wires 62 form an 'X on each lens, ensuring trough<br>
stiffness, which is required for all the homogenizer rods to line up on their respective foci.<br>
Up to twelve Lens-Rod-Cell-Units are installed per trough. Guard-frame 48 in Figure<br>
4 prevents lens 2" from submerging in water-surface 5' at the lowest solar elevation<br>
Figure 6 shows a view on the end plate 56 of a trough with guard-frame 48 and stub-<br>
shaft 57.<br>
Figures 7 and 8 show two troughs with end plates 56 and 56' with stub-shafts 57"<br>
which are supported by ball-bearings. Wall 70 projects between end plates 56 and 56', and<br>
ball bearings 66 and 67 are mounted on it, as well as electricity collectors 71 and 71'. Wall<br>
70 is part of extruded tube 70; most of which lies below water surface 5'. This tube 70' cre-<br>
ates a buoyancy force that is transferred via ball bearings 66 and 67 to stub shafts 57' and<br>
57', thereby supporting troughs 69 and 69'. Extruded tubes 70' are connected to platform-<br>
ring 22' of Figure 1 via supports 75.<br>
Figure 8 shows extruded tube 70' running perpendicular to longitudinal axis 58 (figure<br>
5) of the troughs. At wall 70, ball bearings 67 and 67' and electricity collectors 71 and 71' are<br>
positioned.<br>
Figure 9 shows a cross-section through stub-shaft 57" with ball bearings 66 and 67<br>
and electricity collector 71, in which contact-body 76 is pressed against slide-ring end 78 by<br>
spring 72. Slide-ring end 78 needs to extend only an angle at the center of about 70°, so that<br>
the weight of the trough on contact body 76 keeps it in firm contact with slide-ring end 78 at<br>
all angles of elevation. The slide-ring ends are series-connected with photovoltaic cells 4'<br>
(figure 4) so that opposite electric polarities are attained at opposite ends of the trough. De-<br>
pending on the desired trough output-voltage, the multiple photovoltaic cells can be con-<br>
nected in series for the highest voltage or in parallel for hydrogen-hydrolysis or a combina-<br>
tion of both for intermediate voltages. Similar series-parallel choices will determine how<br>
trough voltages combine for a desired platform voltage, when the power is conducted to the<br>
outside via a highly flexible cable.<br>
The key component of radiation-homogenizer is described in Figures 10 to 14.<br>
Figure 10 is intensity plot 100 of the focal spot of the concentrating lens, with peak<br>
101 of many thousands of suns and the remaining cell area dark. Such excess flux density<br>
will destroy the cell. Instead, a uniform distribution across the ceil will result in 460 suns of<br>
geometric concentration, near the cell optimum.<br><br>
Figure 11 depicts radiation-homogenizer rod 80 receiving at end 81 the focused ra-<br>
' diation of lens 2. Radiation-homogenizer rod 80 is made of glass of the highest volume<br>
transmissivity across the operational solar spectrum, to minimize absorptive heat loads<br>
therein. Most common glasses have solar absorption bands sufficiently dense as to add an<br>
unacceptable heat load to the cell. Figure 12 shows a side view of the same, with slanted<br>
side 84 of rod 80 extending to thermally conductive heat-sink bar 85. This slant is necessary<br>
to keep bar 85 submerged at all solar elevation angles.<br>
Figures 13 and 14 show radiation-homogenizer 80 with walls 86 and 87 and<br>
87'slanting inward towards bottom surface 82. Figure 13 shows rays at middle 130 of en-<br>
trance plane 131, while in figure 14 rays off center. Exit surface 82 is in optical contact with<br>
photovoltaic cell 83 via optical-adhesive layer 83a. The lower side of photovoltaic cell 83 is<br>
connected to metal layer 85a of a material of thermal expansion coefficient close to that of<br>
the cell. This metallic layer is soldered to heat sink 88 before the cell and rod are bonded to<br>
it.<br>
This same optical device, the homogenizing, rod, performs three functions:<br>
a)	Loss-free redistribution over the rectangular exit surface of the highly nonuniform<br>
concentrated solar radiation flux, which forms a circular spot on the entry surface.<br>
b)	Loss-free deflection of the total radiation flux by tilting the rod up to 20° about its<br>
entry face, in order to keep the heat sink submerged.<br>
c)	Providing an expanded entry surface (30% wider than the cell) large enough to<br>
collect all the focused sunlight even at a 1 ° error in elevation tracking<br>
Figure 15 shows the arrangement in which radiation-homogenizer rod 145'" is en-<br>
closed by tube 155, which makes sole contact to rod 145'" via sharp edges that scatter very<br>
little concentrated sunlight Tube 155 is connected to metal base 156, which forms narrow<br>
gap 157 with heat sink 154. Gap 157 is filled with mercury, a supply of which is in bellow<br>
158.<br>
Figure 16 shows an evacuated heat pipe surrounded by bellow 158'. Wick 160 ab-<br>
. sorbs condensate fluid. Spacer 161 prevents heat absorbing pianes 156' and 154' from be-<br>
ing moved together by outside air pressure.<br>
Figure 17a shows a side-view of a trough with the stub-shaft 57". Photovoltaic cell 4'"<br>
is placed in protrusion 165 and is in thermal contact with heat pipe 166, the longitudinal<br>
extension of which runs perpendicular to endplate 56" down the entire length of the trough,<br>
from its first photovoltaic ceil to the last. Figure 17c shows absorbent wick-layer 167 posi-<br>
tioned within heat pipe 166, from whose section 169 the heat transfer fluid, for instance wa-<br>
ter, evaporates. The vapor flows through compartment 170 to wall 171 which stays below<br>
water surface 5'" at all operational solar-elevation angles. At this wail the heat transfer fluid<br><br>
condenses and will be conveyed by capillary forces of wick-layer 167 back to photovoltaic<br>
cell 4"and its waste heat. Heat pipe 166 is air-tight and evacuated except for a small amount<br>
of water.<br>
Figure 17b shows a second trough, which like the first can be tilted down to an eleva-<br>
tion angle of 20°.<br>
As an alternative to the aforementioned pneumatic tracking, Figures 17a and 17b,<br>
show a mechanical method for collectively tilting the lens-photovoltaic-units..<br>
In Figures 17a and 17b, heat pipes 166 of the troughs have eyelets 172 at which<br>
rope 178 is fixed. In order to tilt the troughs around their horizontal axis to lower elevation<br>
angles, rope 178 will be moved by a linear motor in the direction of arrow 180. The adjusting<br>
force for a tilting to higher elevation angles comes from the screw-springs 181 which are<br>
connected.to the platform skeleton.<br>
Figure 18 shows a trough in longitudinal view 182 and cross-sectional view 183. At a dis-<br>
tance 184 of about a quarter of the total length a handle 185 is positioned. Via a crane, not<br>
shown, the rectangular tube 186 will be lowered between the two handles 185. Thereafter<br>
tongues 187 extend from the tube 186. Now the trough with the stab-shafts 57'", whose tor-<br>
sion rigidity is low since it normally floats on water, can be lifted out of its bearings as shown<br>
in Figure 9.<br><br>
