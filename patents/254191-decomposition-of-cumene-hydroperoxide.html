				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0001]      Phenol is manufactured via air oxidation of cumene to cumene hydroperoxide (CHP), followed by acid-catalyzed cleavage of the latter to phenol and acetone, and known as CHP decomposition. CHP decomposition is a very exothermic reaction which is normally carried out on a commercial scale in continuous stirred or back-mixed reactors. In such reactors only a small fraction of CHP is unreacted at any given time and the reaction medium consists essentially of the products of decomposition of CHP, i.e., phenol and acetone, plus any solvent (e.g., cumene) and other materials added with CHP to the reactor. During cumene oxidation small amounts of dimethyl phenyl carbinol (DMPC) and acetophenone are also formed. In the presence of acid catalyst, DMPC dehydrates to alphamethylstyrene (AMS), a useful by-product. Very high yields of AMS can be obtained from pure DMPC, e.g., 98% yield upon dehydration over acidic silica at 300°C. In the presence of phenol, however, and more specifically in a phenol/acetone/cumene mixture which is a solvent in the decomposition of CHP/DMPC mixtures, the ultimate AMS yield is normally 50-60 mol% of the DMPC. Main by-products are AMS dimers and cumylphenol which have no commercial value. Formation of cumylphenol also reduces the phenol yield.<br>
[0002]      Although phenol and acetone have been produced by the decomposition of the cumene oxidation product for decades, there is a continuing incentive to produce at a lower cost and with reduced by-product formation.<br>

BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0007]      The present invention is a process for the decomposition of a cumene oxidation product mixture comprising cumene hydroperoxide (CHP) to produce phenol and acetone with reduced by-product formation by introducing the cumene oxidation product mixture into an inlet of a decomposing vessel containing indirect heat exchange surfaces wherein the cumene oxidation product mixture and a circulating stream comprising cumene hydroperoxide, phenol, acetone and an acid catalyst are admixed, reacted and cooled by passage around the indirect heat exchange surfaces. The indirect heat exchange surfaces not only remove heat from the circulating stream which is exothermic, but serve to thoroughly admix the reactants which are undergoing decomposition to promote an isothermal flowing stream. A resulting reacted and cooled stream is continuously removed from the outlet of the decomposing vessel and at least a portion thereof is introduced into the inlet of the decomposing vessel. Another portion having a cumene hydroperoxide concentration from 0.5 to 5 weight percent is withdrawn for the subsequent recovery of phenol and acetone. In another embodiment, recovered acetone is recycled to the circulating stream. [0008]      Figure 1 is a schematic flow diagram of a preferred embodiment of the present invention for decomposing a cumene oxidation product mixture containing cumene hydroperoxide (CHP) and dimethylphenolcarbinol (DMPC) to produce phenol and acetone.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0009]      It has been discovered that when a cumene oxidation product mixture containing cumene bydroperoxide (CHP) and DMPC is decomposed to produce phenol, acetone and alpha-methyl styrene by passing the cumene oxidation product mixture into a decomposing vessel containing indirect heat exchange surfaces wherein the cumene oxidation product mixture and an incoming circulating stream comprising cumene hydroperoxide, phenol, acetone and an acid catalyst are admixed, reacted and cooled by passage around the indirect<br>
heat exchange surfaces and then circulating a cooled stream comprising unreacted cumene<br><br>
hydroparxide phonol and acotone from the decomposing vessel to provide the circulating stream referred to hereinabove, an improved yield of alpha-methyl styrene is realized. A net reacted stream preferably comprising a cumene hydroperoxide concentration from 0.5 to 5 weight percent ii removed from the circulating stream and recovered. The cumene oxidation product mixture is the result of cumene oxidation with oxygen and preferably comprises a cumene hydroperoxide concentration from 60 to 95 weight percent The ratio of the flow rate of the cumene oxidation product mixture to the flow rate of the circulating stream is preferably from 1:10 to 1:100 in the decomposing vessel. In accordance with the present invention, a suitable and preferred acid catalyst is sulfuric acid. <br>
[0010]      The decomposing vessel is preferably operated at a temperature from 50°C to 80°C and a pressure from 115 kPa to 618 kPa. The resulting effluent from the decomposing vessel is preferably introduced into a circulating stream preferably maintained at a temperature from 50°C to 80°C and a pressure sufficient to maintain a liquid phase. The decomposition of the cumene hydroperoxide is highly exothermic and therefore heat is removed from the decomposing vessel by indirect heat exchange surfaces to maintain the preferred operating temperature. Further, use of the indirect heat exchange surfaces disclosed herein allows the process to be maintained closer to an isothermal temperature condition which is beneficial and highly desk-able to provide a.high selectivity to desired products and to minimize undesirable byproducts.<br>
[0011]      The indirect heat exchange surfaces employed in the internal volume of the decomposing vessel may be any suitable type of known heat exchanger or exchangers. Suitable heat exchange surfaces include stab-in tube bundles, utilizing conventional baffle designs including segmental, helical and grid support systems, and twisted-tube heat exchangers. The indirect heat exchange surfaces may be oriented in any suitable orientation, i.e., vertical or horizontal, for example. The positioning of heat exchange surfaces within the decomposing vessel preferably maximizes the heat transfer efficiency and adequately admixes the entering stream of the cumene oxidation product mixture and the circulating stream comprising cumene bydroperoxide, an acid catalyst and phenol. The heat exchange surfaces not only provide heat removal but serve to admix the flowing contents of the decomposing vessel thereby minimizing any requirement for inline mixers, baffles, stirrers or the like. The internal location of the heat exchange surfaces enables the maintenance of an evenly and<br><br>
consistently controlled heat removal, low residence time and optimal placement which minimizes the overall area required for the plant.<br>
[0012]      A portion of the flowing liquid in the circulating stream, preferably containing from 0.5 to 5 weight percent cumene hydroperoxide, is removed from the circulating stream. Varying amounts of dicumyl peroxide (DCP) are also present in the removed portion and is preferably decomposed in a dehydrator to mainly yield phenol, acetone and alpha-methylstyrene (AMS) by increasing the temperature in the range from 100°C to 170°C. The same higher temperature conditions that favor formation of AMS from DCP also favor the dehydration of dimethyl phenyl carbinol (DMPC) to AMS. It is therefore convenient to transform both the DMPC and the DCP present in the reaction mixture resulting from the acid catalyzed decomposition of CHP by simply heating that mixture to 100°C - 170°C for a limited period of time in a plug-flow reactor referred to as a dehydrator. The dehydrator generally is composed of a heat exchanger in which the reaction mixture is brought up to the desired temperature, in series with a pipe or baffled tank, in which the reaction is completed. The latter part of the reactor is essentially isothermal. The yield of AMS formed in the reaction increases with time as DCP. and the residual DMPC decompose, until it reaches a maximum and then decreases as AMS-reacts further to form AMS dimers and cumyl-phenol. The optimum reaction time depends on the temperature and the concentrations of acid catalyst and water present hi the mixture. Generally, shorter times are required at higher temperatures and in the presence of higher concentrations of acid and lower concentrations of water.<br>
[0013]      In accordance with one embodiment, after the decomposition reaction of the CHP is completed in the dehydrator, the resulting effluent there from is introduced into a flash drum to vaporize at least a portion of the acetone which is subsequently condensed and introduced into the circulating stream. The flash drum is preferably operated at a temperature from 50°C to 150°C and pressure from 1 15 kPa to 618 kPa. The acetone is preferably recycled, serving as a diluent, and introduced into the circulating stream wherein the weight ratio of the acetone recycle to the cumene oxidation product mixture is in the range from 0.1:1 to 2:1. A resulting liquid stream comprising phenol and acetone is removed from the flash drum and fractionated to further separate the products including phenol and acetone.<br><br>
(0014]     A cumene oxidation product mixture is introduced into the process via line 1 into decomposing vessel 2, A circulating stream comprising cumene hydroperoxide, an acid catalyst, phenol and acetone is introduced into decomposing vessel 2 via line 8. The two hercinabovo described streams which are introduced into decomposing vessel 2 pass through decomposing vessel 2 while contacting indirect heat exchange surfaces 3. A resulting admixed and cooled inventory in decomposing vessel 2 is removed there from via line 4. A coolant is introduced into chamber 16 via line 15 and flows into indirect heat exchange surfaces 3. A resulting coolant which has been heated by the flowing contents of decomposing vessel 2 is passed from indirect heat exchange surfaces 3 into chamber 17. A resulting heated coolant is removed from chamber 17 via line 1 8 and recovered. The heated coolant may be cooled and recycled to indirect heat exchange surfaces 3. The reacted flowing stream which was removed from decomposing vessel 2 via line 4 is carried via lines 5 and 19 and introduced into pump 6. The resulting pressurized stream is carried from pump 6 via line 7 and a portion is further carried via line 8 and introduced into decomposing vessel 2 as described hereinabove. Another portion of the pressurized circulating stream from pump 6 and carried via line 7 is carried via line 10 and is admixed with an acid catalyst which is introduced via line 11. The resulting mixture containing the acid catalyst is carried via line 12 and introduced into calorimeter 13 which is used to monitor and control the operating conditions for the decomposition of the CHP. A resulting stream is removed from calorimeter 13 via lines 14,5 and 19 and is passed into pump 6 as hereinabove described. Another portion of the pressurized stream from pump 6 is carried via lines 7 and 9 and introduced into heat exchanger 20 to be heated. A resulting heated stream is removed from heat exchanger 20 via line 21 and introduced into flash drum 22. A vapor stream comprising acetone is removed from flash drum 22 via line 24 and introduced into heat exchanger 25 for cooling. A resulting cooled and condensed stream comprising acetone is removed from heat exchanger 25 via line 26 and is introduced into pump 6 via lines 26 and 19. A resulting stream comprising acetone and phenol is removed from flash drum 22 via line 23 and recovered.<br>
ILLUSTRATIVE EMBODIMENT<br>
(0015)     A cumene oxidation product mixture containing an 88,5 weight percent cumene hydroperoxide (CHP) in an amount of 26 m3/hr is introduced into a decomposer vessel containing heat exchange surfaces sufficient to maintain a desired temperature during the exothermic decomposition of CHP to produce phenol and acetone. The contents of the decomposer include CHP, an acid catalyst, phenol and acetone and aye circulated in an external flowing loop and re-introduced into the decomposer. The external flowing loop is circulated at a flow rate of 26 m3hr and contains a sulfuric acid level of 6 wppm and maintained at a temperature of 75°C. The residence time of the cumene oxidation product mixture in the decomposer and the external flowing loop is 15 minutes. A decomposer product stream containing a CHP concentration of 3 weight percent is removed from the external flowing loop and is passed through a dehydrator operated at a temperature of 135°C. The resulting AMS yield is 85.S mol% and the feed cumene/phenol yield weight ratio is 1.290.
