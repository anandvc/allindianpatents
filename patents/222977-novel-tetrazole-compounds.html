Test Example 6:        Test for safening action on rice by water surface application<br>
Test method<br>
In a greenhouse, paddy soil was filled in pots (1,000 cm2), and seeds of rice (cv. Nipponbare) were sown in the surface layer of the soil in the pots under wet conditions. 7 days after seeding, at the one leaf stage of the rice seedlings, the pots were watered to 3 cm in depth and the depth was kept during the test period. When the rice seedlings grew up to 1.5 leaf stage during the 9 days after seeding, a predetermined amount of the compound as a testing solution prepared in the same manner as the above-mentioned Test Example 4 was applied to the pots by water<br><br>

surface treatment method. The phytotoxicity to rice seedlings was evaluated at 3 weeks after the application on a scale of 0 (no damage) to 100 (complete deth).<br>
Test result of test example 6 are shown in Table 6.<br>
Safening action of Test Example 6 were evaluated by Colby's equation.<br><br>
E :       expected phytotoxicity at p + q g/ha X :      expected phytotoxicity at p g/ha Y :      expected phytotoxicity at q g/ha<br>
