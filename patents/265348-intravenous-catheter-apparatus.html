				<td>AUTOMATIC CAP FOR THE SIDE PORT OF INTRAVENOUS<br>
	CATHETER APPARATUS	<br>
FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to an Intravenous Catheter Apparatus. In particular this invention relate to an automatic cap fitted with a hinge which conveniently and automatically opens or closes the opening of Side Port of Intravenous Catheter Apparatus.<br>
BACKGROUND OF INVENTION<br>
An IV Catheter Apparatus is used to administer medicines, nutrients, glucose in liquid form into the blood stream of a patient during treatment. IV catheter apparatus has a side port that projects laterally. Through the side port, medicines are injected into the body of IV catheter apparatus which through the catheter enters the blood stream of patient. After the needle along with flexible catheter of IV catheter apparatus is inserted in the vein of the patient, blood flashed into the needle. The needle is then withdrawn from the vein and disposed off leaving the catheter inside the vein. IV catheter apparatus having a side port is known from the prior art. In the prior art the port cap is made of plastic which is attached to the side port by a simple linkage. The prior art has following disadvantages: (i) while opening the Port Cap the body of IV Catheter Apparatus has to be held very firmly and securely to avoid displacement of catheter which remains in the blood vessel of the patient (ii) to close the cap after the administration of medicine, the cap has to be pushed against the body of the IV Catheter Apparatus which may cause pain to be patient, (iii) cap of side port even in open condition, comes in the way of administration of medicine, nourishment etc through the side port. This causes<br>
hardship to the medical professionals who administer medicine through the IV Catheter Apparatus (iv) sometimes catheter is displaced from the vein due to the negligent handling of the side port, in such case the catheter needs to be completely withdrawn from the vein of patient and then another IV Catheter Apparatus is taken and insertion of needle with catheter into the vein is repeated at another site. This process if repeated can be traumatic for the patient and will exhaust number of IV Catheter Apparatus which is expensive.<br>
OBJECTS OF INVENTION<br>
It is accordingly an object of the present invention to propose an IV Catheter Apparatus having a automatic cap with a hinge which opens and closes the side port.<br>
Another object of this invention is to propose an IV Catheter Apparatus in which disadvantages of prior art are overcome.<br>
Another object of this invention is to propose an IV Catheter Apparatus having an automatic cap for the side port in which very slight effort or force is required to open the Cap, thus there is no need to very firmly hold the IV Catheter Apparatus.<br>
Yet another object of this invention is to propose an IV Catheter Apparatus having an automatic Cap for side port in which the likelihood of displacement of catheter from vein while manipulating the Cap is negligible.<br>
Another object of this invention is to propose an IV Catheter Apparatus having an automatic Cap for side port in which if slight pressure is applied to the Cap, it automatically closes to completely closed position due to which there is no bio-contamination when the side port is not in use.<br>
Yet another object of this invention is to propose an Intravenous Catheter Apparatus having automatic Cap for side port which does not hinder or come in the way of administration of medicines, glucose and other nourishment through the side port in the blood vessel of the patient.<br>
To the accomplishment of above and to such further objects as may hereinabove appear the present invention relates to automatic cap for the side port of IV Catheter Apparatus as described in the following specification and as considered with the accompanying drawings.<br>
SUMMERY OF INVENTION<br>
This invention consists of a circular plastic Cap fitted with a hinge and having annular collar used as opening tab. The Hinge facilitates the automatic opening and closing of the Cap of the side port. To open the Cap the annular collar is pulled slightly, and the Cap automatically opens to its full position. Thus Cap of side port does not interfere or block the way while the medicines, glucose, etc. are injected through the side port. To close the Cap the annular collar has to be pressed slightly and it automatically closes access to the side port which ensures that there are no bio-contaminations when the side port is not is use. The Hinge provided in the Cap enables the easy and safe opening and closing of the Cap thereby the position of catheter in the blood vessel of a patient is not impaired. The compact and rounded design of the Cap having an annular collar along with other subsidiary features, also enables the Cap to be operated with ease and by applying relatively negligible pressure without affecting the position of the Catheter in the blood vessel of a patient.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION<br>
Figure 1 shows the IV Catheter Apparatus 2 constituting needle cover 3, wings 5, automatic cap 6 which covers the side port 15, flush back chamber 7 and a luer lock 8. IV Catheter Apparatus 2 is used to inject medicines in liquid form and nutritional fluid through the side port 15 which is closed by automatic cap 6.<br>
Figure 2a, is the side view of automatic cap 6; Figure 2b is the top view of automatic cap 6 and Figure 2c is lateral view of automatic cap 6. Automatic cap assembly 6 consist of a holding ring 9, connecting the dome shaped cap 11 by means of connection web 13. A living hinge 10 is connected to the cap 11 at one end and holding ring 9 at the other end. The living hinge 10 by snap action closes and opens the cap 11 on the annular projection 14 of the side port 15. The cap 11 has annular collar 12 which serves as a opening tab.<br>
Figure 3 shows the cross-section side view of Intravenous Catheter Apparatus 2 of Figure 1.<br>
The side port 15 has annular projection 14 extending at 90 degrees to the main body of IV Catheter Apparatus 2. The holding ring 9 of the automatic cap assembly 6 is pushed over the annular projection 14 till it goes past the under cut 16 such that the holding ring 9 envelops the annular projection 14. The under cut 16 does not allow the holding ring 9 to come out of the annular projection 14.<br>
Figure 4 is enlarged view of section 3-3 of Figure 3. To open the automatic cap assembly 6 the annular collar 12 is pulled upward by slight force exerted by the medical professional by his thumb at the downward portion of the annular collar 12. The annular collar 12 which extend along 270<br>
degrees around the cap 11 which is connected by the hinge 10 to the holding ring 9. As the annular collar 12 is pushed upward, hinge 10 by snap action pulls the cap 11 upward so that the cap 11 detaches from the annular project 14 of the side port 15 thus opening the passage to side port 15.<br>
When the side port 15 is open, medicine and nutritional material is injected into the side port 15 which then through the wing housing 17 and catheter 18 enters the vein of the patient under treatment. After the injection of medicine or nutritional fluids, the cap 11 of the automatic cap assembly 6 has to be closed over annular projection 14 of the side port 15.<br>
For replacing the cap 11 over the annular projection 14, the collar 12 is again pushed in the direction of closing the cap 11. As slight force is applied to the collar 12, the hinge 10 by snap action pushes the cap 11 over the annular projection 14 above the side port 15. When the cap 11 is replaced over annular projection 14 the opening of the side port 15 is completely closed.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
