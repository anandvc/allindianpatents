				<td>ionic iron. The ionic iron binds to transferrin, which, in turn, transfers it to the bone<br>
marrow for erythropoiesis or to ferritin and the iron storage pool in the marrow,<br>
spleen and liver.<br>
Physiology and Metabolism of Iron<br>
The human body stores trivalent iron as ferritin and hemosiderin. Ferritin is<br>
comprised of an outer protein shell containing a storage cavity for a polynuclear<br>
ferric hydroxide/phosphate core of approximate composition [(FeOOH)8(Fe)-<br>
OPO3H2)]n- Ferritin's protein shell, apoferritin, is composed of 24 polypeptide<br>
subunits forming the apoferritin molecule, which has an average molecular weight<br>
of about 440,000. Apoferritin's outer shell has a diameter of approximately 13<br>
nanometers (130 A) with an interior cavity of about 7 nanometers (70 A).<br>
Ferritin's protein shell, apoferritin, functions as a ferroxidase enzyme in the<br>
binding and oxidizing of divalent iron which it then stores within its cavity as a<br>
polynuclear ferric hydroxide/phosphate core. Ferritin may contain up to 4,500<br>
polymerized ferric ions with a molecular weight for the entire molecule ranging<br>
from 700,000 to 800,000. Over 30% of the weight of the ferritin molecule may be<br>
iron.<br>
When the amount of available iron exceeds ferritin's iron storage<br>
mechanism, an aggregated ferritin is formed called hemosiderin, which is a normal<br>
constituent of the monocyte-macrophage system. Hemosiderin is composed of<br>
molecules of ferritin, which have lost part of their protein shell and become<br>
aggregated. Hemosiderin accounts for about one third of normal iron stores and<br>
accumulates as insoluble granules in the cells of the reticuloendothelial system.<br><br>
Ferritin is water soluble and may enter the blood stream through osmosis.<br>
Normal serum levels of ferritin are dependent on sex/age and range between 40 and<br>
160 ng/mL. It is believed that in the blood stream, ferritin slowly releases divalent<br>
iron in conjunction with a reducing agent, such as reduced flavin mononucleotide<br>
and to a lesser extent, ascorbic acid. The divalent iron is oxidized back to trivalent<br>
iron by ceruloplasmin, then tightly bound to the blood protein apotransferrin<br>
forming transferrin. The molecular weight of transferrin is about 76,000 and each<br>
molecule has two binding sites for ferric ions.<br>
Upon administration to a patient, an iron sucrose complex (or other trivalent<br>
iron colloids formulated, e.g., with gluconate, dextran, sorbitol or dextrin) is<br>
removed from the blood stream as a particle by the macrophages of the<br>
reticuloendothelial system and metabolized to replenish the body's iron stores of<br>
hemosiderin, ferritin and transferrin. The rate of removal from the blood stream is<br>
dependent on both the colloidal ferric hydroxide's particle size and composition.<br>
Synthesis of Iron Carbohydrate Complexes<br>
Iron carbohydrate complexes, such as iron sucrose, are composed of<br>
colloidal ferric hydroxide particles (i.e., cores) in complex with sucrose. These iron<br>
cores are prepared by the neutralization of ferric chloride with an alkali to a pH of 2.<br>
At this pH, the saturation of hydroxide ions induces the formation of colloidal ferric<br>
hydroxide, which after formation complexes in situ with a suitable carbohydrate,<br>
such as sucrose. The structure of the iron core follows classic coordination<br>
chemistry. The carbohydrate complexes with the iron core as its hydroxyl groups<br>
displace the water molecules bonded to the iron core's outer surface.<br><br>
The bonding between the iron core and the carbohydrate is a non-covalent<br>
intermolecular force, such as the attraction of partial positive charges of the core's<br>
surface iron atoms to the negative dipole moments of the carbohydrate's hydroxyl<br>
groups.<br>
	iron sucrose, for example, has a molecular weight (Mw) of about 34,000 -<br>
60,000 Daltons and a molecular formula as follows:<br>
[Na2Fe5O8(OH) • 3(H2O)]n • m(C12H22O11)<br>
where n is the degree of iron polymerization and m is the number of sucrose<br>
molecules (C12H22O11) in complex with the poly-nuclear polymerized iron core:<br>
	[Na2Fe5O8(OH) • 3(H2O)]n.<br>
In solution, an equilibrium exists between a poly-nuclear polymerized iron<br>
core (Pn) and its solubilizing ligand (L):<br>
[Pn] + (m)[L] = [Pn]-m[L]<br>
In order to assure a stable water-soluble iron complex, an excess amount of<br>
 the solubilizing ligand is required and the equilibrium is as follows:<br>
[Pn] + (x)[L] → [Pn].m[L] + (x-m)[L]<br>
A preferred method of synthesizing such iron carbohydrate complexes is described,<br>
for example, in published PCT Application WO 97/11711 (1997) by Lawrence et al.<br>
Evaluation of Iron Carbohydrate Homogeneity<br>
	Iron dextran complexes produced by the neutralization of ferric chloride in<br>
the presence of dextran have a similar structural formula, but differ in the degree of<br><br>
polymerization of the ferric hydroxide cores. See, for example, Lawrence (1998).<br>
The Lawrence paper also discusses methods to assess the homogeneity of particle<br>
sizes in an iron dextran complex by evaluating reduction degradation kinetics. After<br>
describing the evaluation of three iron dextran products from different<br>
manufacturers, the paper reports that there were marked differences among them in<br>
each of the physical and chemical parameters measured.<br>
Determination of Bioequivalence of Iron Dextran Particles<br>
As noted above, commercial iron supplement formulations are complex<br>
colloidal suspensions. For example, according to the USP Monograph for Iron<br>
Sucrose Injection by Luitpold Pharmaceuticals, Inc., to be published in the 2nd<br>
Supplement to the USP 25 in July/August 2002, such a formulation is pH controlled,<br>
and contains a controlled amount of particulate matter in addition to the iron and<br>
sucrose components. A comparison between commercial preparations of iron (10)<br>
dextrin complexes was reported by Erni, et al., "Chemical Characterization of Iron<br>
(III)-Hydroxide-Dextrin Complexes" Arzneim.-Forsch./Drug Res. 34(11): 1555-1559<br>
(1984). The paper noted that hydrolysis products of iron (III) may differ<br>
enormously in their structural, morphological, and chemical properties depending on<br>
the conditions under which they are formed and other factors. Attention was drawn<br>
to the nature of such hydrolysis products rather than the oxidation state of the iron -<br>
that is, iron (II) as compared with iron (III).<br>
Erni et al. discusses the kinetic analysis of iron (III) reduction and relates it<br>
to the distribution of particle sizes and a range of surface to volume ratios in<br>
monodisperse as compared with polydisperse systems. See, for example, Sections<br><br>
2.3 and 3.2 at pages 1556-57. Ascorbic acid, citric acid, phosphoric acid and<br>
sorbitol are a few of the reducing agents utilized by Emi, et al. Bioavailability in the<br>
context of oral preparations is also discussed; however, notably, these authors<br>
conclude that chemical tests alone will not allow for the prediction of bioavailability<br>
' because they do not simulate the complex chemical environment of the intestine<br>
(See page 1559).<br>
Other known processes have utilized the molecular weight distribution of a<br>
complex to correlate its bioavailability. However, this kind of distribution appears to<br>
vary dependent on the method, protocol and standards used in the molecular weight<br>
) analysis. See, for instance, PCT W097/11711 to Lawrence, et al.<br>
General guidance on in vitro testing for immediate release solid oral dosage<br>
forms by dissolution testing is provided by the FDA at<br>
http://www.fda.gov/cder/guidance/1713bpl.pdf, and is entitled "Guidance for<br>
Industry: Dissolution Testing of Intermediate Release Solid Oral Dosage Forms."<br>
	Thus, while an evaluation of the particle size distribution of iron-containing<br>
complexes has been reported, based upon their reduction degradation kinetics, the<br>
literature does not appear to have identified any particular correlation between the<br>
distribution of particle size and bioequivalence. Indeed, specific kinetic parameters,<br>
such as T75, have not heretofore been defined and associated with bioequivalence.<br>
 What has been needed, therefore, is an accurate, inexpensive method for measuring<br>
reliably and consistently the bioequivalence of iron-containing compositions, as well<br>
as a quality control standard for so doing. Such a method would also permit the<br><br>
optimization of iron supplement formulations and the comparison of batches in<br>
production.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
In the human body, the metabolism and mobilization of iron involve a series<br>
	of oxidation/reduction reactions wherein the valence of the iron changes back and<br>
forth from its divalent and trivalent states. In order to control and monitor the batch-<br>
to-batch bioequivalence of iron-sucrose complexes, an in vitro test has been<br>
developed to measure the colloidal ferric hydroxide's rate of reduction from trivalent<br>
iron to divalent iron. The colloidal ferric hydroxide core dissociates as the iron is<br>
 reduced, and the rate of dissociation of the colloidal ferric hydroxide core is directly<br>
proportional to its particle size. In addition, for ferric hydroxide cores that are<br>
uniform in particle size (i.e., monodispersed) and composition, their rate of<br>
reduction follows first order kinetics.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, ascorbic acid, added in<br>
	excess, in physiological saline is used as the in vitro test's reducing agent. The<br>
ascorbic acid (C6H8O6) reduces the iron core's trivalent iron (Fe3+) to the divalent<br>
iron (Fe2+) ion as follows:<br>
2[(Fe(OH3))(Pn-1) ] + C6H8O6 →2Fe(OH)2 + 2(Pn-1) + C6H6O6 + 2H2O<br>
Ascorbic acid is oxidized to dehydroascorbic acid (C6H6O6) and ferric hydroxide<br>
 (Fe(OH)3) is reduced to ferrous hydroxide (Fe(OH)2).<br>
The colloidal ferric hydroxide complexes are dark red to brown solutions<br>
with a strong adsorption band at 450 nm. As the reduction to ferrous hydroxide<br><br>
occurs, the color is discharged, resulting in a decrease in absorbency. This decay (or<br>
dissociation) can be easily monitored in a temperature controlled (37 + 1°C) UV/Vis<br>
spectrophotometer set at 450 nm.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, the T75 time for the<br>
reduction of the iron-carbohydrate complex is used to determined the relative<br>
bioequivalence by reducing the complex with an appropriate reducing agent. A<br>
preferred bioequivalence standard for an iron-sucrose formulation is met if its T75<br>
reduction time is not more than 20 minutes and its reduction reaction plot of "Log<br>
(% Trivalent Iron Concentration)" versus "Time" is linear with a correlation<br>
 coefficient absolute value of not less than 0.98.<br>
Additional features, advantages, and embodiments of the invention may be<br>
set forth or apparent from consideration of the following detailed description and<br>
claims. Moreover, it is to be understood that both the foregoing summary of the<br>
invention and the following detailed description are exemplary and intended to<br>
 provide further explanation without limiting the scope of the invention as claimed.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is based, in part, on the discovery that the<br>
bioequivalence of iron in iron-carbohydrate complexes, particularly iron-sucrose<br>
formulations, may usefully be determined by assessing the kinetics of reduction<br>
 degradation of the iron (HI) containing complexes. Specifically, the present<br>
inventors have discovered that the reduction time for a given preparation can be<br>
usefully correlated with bioequivalence. Since the kinetics of reduction are a<br>
function of the particle size distribution of the complexes, an analysis of these<br><br>
kinetics allows a determination of the particle size distribution. The particle size<br>
distribution is used, in turn, to determine the bioequivalence. This method reduces<br>
the analysis time and significantly reduces the costs otherwise associated with the<br>
evaluation of bioequivalence of iron supplement formulations during and after their<br>
 production.<br>
The present invention is directed to a method of detennining the relative<br>
bioequivalence of iron in an iron-carbohydrate complex by contacting the complex<br>
with a reducing agent, detennining the reduction kinetics of the complex, and<br>
comparing these kinetics to the reduction kinetics of a standard composition of<br>
 known bioequivalence.<br>
The present invention also includes a method of determining the relative<br>
bioequivalence of iron in an iron-carbohydrate complex by contacting the complex<br>
with a reducing agent and determining a T75 for the reduction kinetics of the<br>
complex. A T75 of less than about 20 minutes indicates an effective bioequivalence<br>
5 of iron in the complex when administered to a subject. Preferably the T75 is less<br>
than about 18 minutes, and more preferably the T75 is between about 9 to about 18<br>
minutes.<br>
Preferably the iron-carbohydrate complexes are made up of carbohydrates,<br>
such as dextran, dextrin, gluconate, sorbitol and sucrose, for example. Most<br>
 preferably, the iron-carbohydrate complex is iron-sucrose.<br>
The inventive methods may utilize any number of suitable reducing agents<br>
including, for instance, reduced flavin mononucleotide, dithionite, thioglycolate,<br><br>
hydroquinone, lactate, citrate, bicarbonate, pyruvate, succinate, fructose, cysteine,<br>
sorbitol, and especially preferred is ascorbic acid. The reducing agent may be<br>
present in an amount sufficient to drive the reduction reaction to completion, or at<br>
least to substantial completion, and preferably, in about a 50-fold excess to the iron-<br>
carbohydrate complex. Also preferred is use of a reducing agent that is in solution<br>
and has an acidic pH, most preferably, the solution pH is from about 1.0 to about<br>
4.0.<br>
The present invention also includes an inventive quality control apparatus for<br>
determining the bioequivalence of iron-carbohydrate complexes. The inventive<br>
 apparatus features a computer-monitored production system which monitors the<br>
reduction kinetics of the product of a reaction between a colloidal ferric hydroxide<br>
and a carbohydrate at different stages of the reaction.<br>
Preferably, the product is reduced with a reducing agent, such as ascorbic<br>
acid. Preferably, the reducing agent is present in an amount sufficient to drive the<br>
reduction reaction to completion, or at least to substantial completion. More<br>
preferably, the reducing agent is present in at least about a 50-fold excess to the<br>
product. Also preferred is a reducing agent that is in solution and has an acidic pH,<br>
especially preferred is a solution pH of from about 1.0 to about 4.0.<br>
The product is, preferably, a complex of iron and a carbohydrate selected<br>
from the group consisting of dextran, dextrin, gluconate, sorbitol and sucrose.<br>
Particularly, preferred is when the carbohydrate is sucrose.<br><br>
The present invention is also directed to a quality control method to identify<br>
batches of iron-carbohydrate complexes having substantially the same<br>
bioequivalence. The method includes formulating iron-carbohydrate complexes,<br>
using the above method to determine the reduction kinetics of a selected batch of<br>
 iron-carbohydrate complex, and identifying batches of iron-carbohydrate complex<br>
that meet the reduction kinetics of a standard composition of known bioequivalence.<br>
A kit for assessing the bioequivalence of an iron-sucrose complex utilizing a<br>
container to hold a sample of the iron-sucrose complex, means for determining the<br>
reduction kinetics of the iron-sucrose complex, and means for relating the reduction<br>
) kinetics to the bioequivalence of a known standard iron-sucrose complex is also<br>
included in the present invention.<br>
Definitions<br>
"Bioavailability" means the physiological availability of a given amount of<br>
the active component of a drug administered orally to a subject, as distinct from the<br>
 drug's chemical concentration or potency.<br>
"Bioequivalence" means a substantially similar activity profile of a drug as<br>
compared with a standard, or another formulation, for that drug or another drug.<br>
"T75" or "T75 interval" or "T75 reduction time" means the time (in minutes) at<br>
which not less than 75% of iron sucrose solution's colloidal ferric hydroxide is<br>
 reduced (i.e., dissociated).<br><br>
In light of the foregoing discussion, the specific examples presented below<br>
are illustrative only and are not intended to limit the scope of the invention. Other<br>
generic and specific configurations will be apparent to persons skilled in the art.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
Stock solutions are prepared daily. A 0.9% sodium chloride diluting solution<br>
(solution A) is prepared by weighing 9.00 g of sodium chloride into a 1000 mL<br>
volumetric flask and adding purified water to volume. The solution is then<br>
maintained at 37°C in a water bath,<br>
A stock ascorbic acid solution (solution B) is prepared by weighing about 8.8<br>
g into a 50 mL volumetric flask, and then add as much as necessary of solution A.<br>
This solution is also maintained at 37oC.<br>
An iron sucrose stock solution is prepared by transferring 5.0 mL of the<br>
sample to a 50 mL volumetric flask, and then adding purified water to volume. This<br>
solution is also maintained at 37°C.<br>
The general procedure to monitor the reaction is to place 20.0 mL of solution<br>
A, 4.0 mL of solution B and 1.0 mL of iron sucrose stock solution in a 25 mL<br>
volumetric flask. This solution is mixed well and then an appropriate amount is<br>
transferred to a 1 cm quartz cell in a temperature controlled UVTVis<br>
spectrophotometer set at 37°C. The absorption at 450 nm is measured at 1-minute<br>
intervals for a total reaction time of 80 minutes. Solution A is used as the blank.<br>
The percentage of trivalent iron concentration at a given observation time is<br>
calculated using the following equation:<br>
100 x [(Observed Abs. - Final Abs.)/(Initial Abs. - Final Abs.)]<br><br>
The iron sucrose solution meets its bioequivalence standard if the T75 reduction time<br>
is not more man 20 minutes and a plot of "Log(% Trivalent Iron Concentration)"<br>
versus 'Time" over 60 minutes is linear with a correlation coefficient of not less<br>
than 0.98.<br>
Example 1: In Vitro Test's Use in Control of Intermediate Iron Sucrose<br>
Solutions:<br>
A saturated ferric chloride solution is contacted with a 10 % w/v sodium<br>
carbonate solution at a neutral pH of about 7. The resulting colloidal ferric<br>
hydroxide gel is washed with sufficient quantities of purified water to remove all<br>
trace amounts of sodium chloride, present as a by-product of the reaction.<br>
A sufficient quantity of saturated sucrose solution is added to the colloidal<br>
ferric hydroxide gel at a volume equivalent to produce a final solution containing<br>
approximately 4.0% w/w elemental iron. The solution's pH is adjusted to 10.7 with<br>
sodium hydroxide and the solution is mixed at 90°C for 36 hours. In-process QC<br>
samples are taken for pH, iron content and in vitro bioequivalence testing. If the<br>
results are within limits, the solution's volume is adjusted by addition of purified<br>
water to provide a final iron content of about 4.0% w/w elemental iron, then filtered<br>
through a 0.2 micron membrane.<br>
The following in vitro test results were obtained on an intermediate iron<br>
sucrose solution containing 3.7% w/w elemental iron:<br><br><br>
The regression output for Graph 1 demonstrates that the trivalent iron's<br>
30 reduction is linear with a correlation coefficient of 0.99757. This indicates that the<br>
reduction of this intermediate iron sucrose solution's colloidal ferric hydroxide cores<br>
follows first order kinetics, where the T75 is calculated using the following equation:<br><br>
Where: "1.3979" is the Log of the % trivalent iron concentration at the 75%<br>
reduction time point (i.e., % trivalent iron concentration = 25%), "b" is the constant,<br>
and "m" is the X Coefficient<br>
Using the values of "b" and "m" obtained from the linear regression of Graph 1, the<br>
 T75 for this intermediate iron sucrose solution is found at 13.36 minutes.<br>
Example 2: In Vitro Test's Use in Control of Iron Sucrose Solutions Suitable<br>
for Injectable Use.<br>
An iron sucrose solution, suitable for injectable use, is prepared by diluting<br>
an intermediate solution, as described in Example 1, with water for injection to a<br>
 final elemental iron concentration of 20 mg/mL. The resulting solution's pH is<br>
adjusted to 10.8 with sodium hydroxide, then mixed until homogeneous. The<br>
solution is transferred via stainless steel supply lines and filtered through two<br>
sterilized 0.2 micron filters set-up in series into a sterilized filling flask. The filter<br>
and filling flask are set-up under laminar flow inside the designated filling room<br>
 under constant class 100 conditions.<br>
All equipment used during filling is identified, sterilized, and recorded.<br>
Stoppers are washed, siliconized, depyrogenated and sterilized. The glassware is<br>
washed using deionized water with a final rinse of water for injection, then<br>
depyrogenated.<br>
	The vial fillers are situated under laminar flow class 100 work stations in<br>
environmentally controlled class 10,000 clean rooms. HEP A filters directly above<br>
the vial fillers provide an invisible wall of sterile particle-free air to prevent<br><br><br><br>
As with example 1, the regression output for Graph 2 demonstrates that the<br>
trivalent iron's reduction is linear with a correlation coefficient of 0.9969, indicating<br>
that the reduction of this iron sucrose solution, suitable for injectable use, follows<br>
first order kinetics. The T75 calculated using the following equation:<br>
T75= (1.3979 -b)/m;<br>
is found at 11.32 minutes.<br>
Although the present invention has been described in detail with reference to<br>
examples above, it is understood that the various modifications can be made<br>
without departing from the spirit of the invention. Accordingly, the invention is<br>
