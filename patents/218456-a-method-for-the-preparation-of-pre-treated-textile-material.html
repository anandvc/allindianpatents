				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present application relates to a method for preparation of pretreatment texture component particularly, the present invention relates to stability enhanced hydrophobic peracid bleaching systems for textile applications, and even more particularly to the use of specialized stabilizer systems for stabilizing peracid in the bleaching solution.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
In the industrial textile processing of natural fibers, yarns and fabrics, a pretreatment or preparation step is typically required to properly prepare the natural materials for further use and in particular for the dyeing and/or finishing stages typically required for commercial goods.<br>
These textile treatment steps remove impurities and color bodies, either naturally existing or those added by the spinning and weaving steps to the fibers and/or fabrics.<br>
A common pretreatment step involves bleaching to destroy naturally occurring color bodies. This bleaching step provides a uniform base for dyeing, printing or additional finishing steps. Thus, a highly successful bleaching step is necessary for commercially acceptable consumer fabrics. Traditional textile bleaching of natural fibers has involved the use of hydrogen peroxide.<br>
Hydrogen peroxide has gained its wide acceptance due to its flexibility of use being capable in both hot and rapid or cold and long dwell bleaching processes and due to its environmental friendliness.<br>
While hydrogen peroxide has gained wide spread acceptance in the textile industry, it is not a particularly effective bleaching agent. Hydrogen peroxide, as commercially supplied, is an extremely stable compound and as a result has only a slight bleaching effect on natural fibers. To overcome its weak activity, extremely high temperatures and/or extremely long bleaching time are required in commercial processes in addition to activation of the peroxide. That is, temperatures in excess of 95°C are typically required. In addition, activation of the peroxide via the use of alkali, sulfuric acid, UV irradiation, hypochlorite or organic activators is also necessary with alkali being the most preferred.    Not only do these drawbacks result in excessive cost<br>
FIELD OF INVENTION<br>

Thus, a highly successful bleaching step is necessary for commercially acceptable consumer fabrics. Traditional textile bleaching of natural fibers has involved the use of hydrogen peroxide.<br>
Hydrogen peroxide has gained its wide acceptance due to its flexibility of use being capable in both hot and rapid or cold and long dwell bleaching processes and due to its environmental friendliness.<br>
While hydrogen peroxide has gained wide spread acceptance in the textile industry, it is not a particularly effective bleaching agent. Hydrogen peroxide, as commercially supplied, is an extremely stable compound and as a result has only a slight bleaching effect on natural fibers. To overcome its weak activity, extremely high temperatures and/or extremely long bleaching time are required in commercial processes in addition to activation of the peroxide. That is, temperatures in excess of 95°C are typically required. In addition, activation of the peroxide via the use of alkali, sulfuric acid, UV irradiation, hypochlorite or organic activators is also necessary with alkali being the most preferred.   Not only do these drawbacks result in excessive cost<br>
associated with commercial textile peroxide bleaching, but the high temperatures and/or long contact times result in significant fiber damage and strength reduction of the resultant yarns and fabrics.<br>
Hydrophobic bleach activators, such as nonanoyloxybenzene sulfonate, sodium salt (NOBS) have been employed in consumer laundry detergent applications such as Tide® with Bleach to work in conjunction with peroxygen sources to provide activated bleaching in consumer laundering of garments. However, the severe conditions employed in the bleaching of textiles have heretofore prevented the successful application of laundry detergent bleaching technology in textile mill applications. The lack of stability of these hydrophobic bleach systems under the conditions in which they are employed in textile bleaching is a major contributing factor to this lack of success. Indeed EP 584.710 discloses the use of activated bleaching in textile mill applications wherein hydrophobic activators are briefly disclosed along with a multitude of other classes and types of activators. While they are disclosed, there is no successful application of hydrophobic bleaching technology where acceptable whiteness values are achieved while damage to fabrics and fibers is rmnimized. Indeed, EP 584,710 specifies that in order to achieve acceptable whiteness benefits, additional alkali bleaching is necessary which will dramatically increase fiber damage. Thus, a stable, effective hydrophobic bleaching system for use in industrial textile applications is heretofore unknown.<br>
Accordingly, the need remains for a stable hydrophobic bleaching treatment method for effective bleaching in textile applications which can provide superior whiteness benefits, especially at reduced bleaching temperatures and times while providing improved fabric strength retention versus conventional textile bleaching processes.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
The aforementioned needs are provided via the present invention wherein a stability enhanced bleaching method and composition are provided. The present invention involves the use of hydrophobic peracid bleaching systems in conjunction with a peracid stabilizing system to produce the superior bleaching properties of the present invention. Hydrophobic peracid bleaching systems while heretofore being knpwn have been/unable to achieve a commercial acceptable result from traditional bleaching. Indeed, additional damaging bleaching steps or materials were required in order to produce commercially acceptable goods.<br>
While not wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that the hydrophobic peracid of the present invention provides better absorbency on the fabrics and yarns and better "wetting" of the surface of the fibers than conventional peroxide bleaching techniques or hydrophilic<br>
activators. Hydrophobic bleach activators form the active bleaching species, peracid, on the surface of the fabric allowing a longer time on the surface of the fabric. Hydrophilic activators, meanwhile, form peracid in solution and must then undergo a fabric solution interaction which is less efficient. As a result, the hydrophobic bleaching agents of the present invention provide superior bleaching and whiteness while minimizing fiber damage and strength reduction.<br>
However, the present invention delivers peracid bleaching systems capable of superior whiteness and fabric strength retention benefits via the discovery and use of a peracid stabilization system. While not wishing to be bound by theory, it has been discovered via the present invention that poor water quality in textile processing leads to ineffective performance of hydrophobic peracid bleaching systems. In particular, the presence of elevated levels of iron, calcium and magnesium contribute to instability of the peracid and ineffective bleaching performance. Accordingly, via the use of the present invention superior textile bleaching performance in hydrophobic peracid bleaching systems may be achieved. The present invention involves the use of specific ratios of peracid generated to the stabilization syste of form about 1:1 to about 100:1 to deliver these unexpected results.<br>
In preferred embodiments of the present invention, the hydrophobic peracid is formed from the combination of hydrogen peroxide and a hydrophobic bleach activator and the stabilizing system comprises one or more organic phosphonic acids or organic phosponates more particularly, one or more compounds selected from the group consisting of 1-hydroxyethylidene-1,1-diphosphonic acid, amino penta (methylenephosphonic acids), amino terra (methylenephosphonic acids), amino hi (methlyenephosphonic acids) and mixtures thereof. The resultant treated textile component has a whiteness value on the CDS index of at least about 70 or a fiber degradation increase of less than 25%.<br>
The peracid employed in the present invention may be preferably delivered via the use of a textile hydrophobic bleach precursor composition which comprises at least about 8 % by weight of a hydrophobic bleach precursor and stabilizing amount of a chelant stabilizing system wherein the ratio of activator to chelant is from about 2:1 to about 20:1 active weight basis. Preferably the composition is in slurry form and comprises at least about 50% by weight of the hydrophobic bleach precursor. Even more preferred is a delivery mechanism whereby the bleach precursor composition comprises at least a first composition having at least about 10 % by weight of a hydrophobic bleach precursor and at least a second composition having a stabilizing amount of a chelant stabilizing system.<br>
All percentages, ratios and proportions herein are on a 100% weight basis unless otherwise indicated. All documents cited herein are hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
Detailed Description of the Preferred Embodiments According to the present invention, a superior textile treatment process for fibers, yarns and fabrics, both knitted and woven, is provided. The proper preparation of a textile component such as a fiber, yarn or fabric is critical to the success of further treatment in the manufacture of commercially acceptable textile components such as yarns, fabrics, garments, and the like. These treatment steps include dyeing, printing and/or additional steps finishing such as application of durable press finishes. Uneven color appearance or impurities such as waxes or oils on the surface of the textile prevent the uniform application of many treatments. Present commercial textile preparation methods, and, in particular, textile bleaching methods, remain unsatisfactory due to the fiber and fabric damage of the treated textiles, high costs associated with the high temperatures necessary to drive bleaching, high costs due to extra equipment necessary for separate treatment steps for de-sizing, scouring and bleaching, and environmental unfriendliness due to an excess of toxic salts in the waste.<br>
The present invention provides a cost effective and superior performing alternative to the conventional processing. The present invention involves the use of a hydrophobic peracid bleaching system for the bleaching of non-finished textile components. Hydrophobic peracid bleaching provides superior results in the context of textile whiteness and in fabric strength retention when used in conjunction with the peracid stabilizing system of the present invention. While conventional textile bleaching processes require high temperatures of more than 95°C to achieve satisfactory whiteness values of more than 70 on the OE whiteness index, the result is a degradation of the strength of the fabric of 15% and more of the original fabric strength and a degradation of the fibers of 50% or more. The method of the present invention provides satisfactory whiteness values of more than 70 on the GEE whiteness index while delivering superior fabric strength retention by providing a fabric strength reduction of less man about 10%, more preferably less than about 5% and most preferably less than about 3% of the original fabric strength. Additionally, the method of the present invention provides a degradation of the fibers of less than 25%, more preferably less than 15% and even more preferably of no more than 10% whereby an increase in degradation represents an increase in fiber damage. Accordingly, the use of the method of the present invention results in a significant reduction in fiber damage as opposed to conventional bleaching technology of peroxide at more than 95°C which produces significantly higher degradation.<br>
The present invention involves the use of an aqueous bleaching solution of a hydrophobic peracid in either hot processing, that is, processing at elevated temperatures, in both batch and<br>
continuous conditions, or cold processing taking place at room temperatures. The peracid may be<br>
formed in situ in the bleaching solution or be supplied via a pre-formed hydrophobic peracid with<br>
the in situ formation preferably from the combination of hydrogen peroxide and a hydrophobic<br>
bleach activator. The hydrogen peroxide or pre-formed peracid is present in the bleaching<br>
solution of the present invention at levels of from about 1 to about 40 g/L, more preferably from<br>
about 1 to about 30 g/L and most preferably from about 1.5 to about 20 g/L for continuous<br>
processing; from about 1 to about 20 g/L, more preferably from about 1 to about 10 g/L and most<br>
preferably from about 1.5 to about 5 g/L for hot batch or from about 1 to about 50 g/L, more<br>
preferably from about 5 to about 40 g/L and most preferably from about 10 to about 30 g/L in<br>
cold processing. The hydrophobic activator is then employed at molar ratios of activator to<br>
peroxide of from about 1:1 to about 1:50, more preferably from about 1:2 to about 1:30 and even<br>
more preferably from about 1:5 to about 1:20 in hot processing with 1:3 to about 1:15 being most<br>
preferred in cold processing.<br>
Particularly useful and preferred for the generation of hydrophobic peracid is the<br>
combination of hydrogen peroxide and hydrophobic bleach activators, and in particular the<br>
alkanoyloxy class of bleach activators having the general formula:<br>
O II R-C-O-L<br>
wherein R is an alkyl chain having from about 5 to about 17, preferably from about 7 to about<br>
11 carbon atoms and L can be essentially any suitable leaving group. (A leaving group is any<br>
group that is displaced from the bleaching activator as a consequence of the nucleophilic attack<br>
on the bleach activator by the perhydroxide anoin This, the perhydrolysis reaction, results in<br>
the formation of the peroxycarboxylic acid. Generally, for a group to be a suitable leaving<br>
group it must exert an electron attracting effect. It should also form a stable entity so that the<br>
rate of the back reaction is negligible. This facilitates the nucleophilic attack by the<br>
perhydroxide anion.<br>
The L group must be sufficiently reactive for the reaction to occur within the optimum<br>
time frame. However, if L is too reactive, this activator will be difficult to stabilize for use in a<br>
bleaching composition. These characteristics are generally paralleled by the pKa of the<br>
conjugate acid of the leaving group, although exceptions to this convention are known.<br>
Ordinarily, leaving groups that exhibit such behavior are those in which their conjugate acid has<br>
a pKa in the range of from about 4 to about 13, preferably from about 6 to about 11 and most<br>
preferably from about 8 to about 11. For the purposes of the present invention, L is selected<br>
from the group consisting of:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
and mixtures thereof, wherein R is an alkyl, aryl, or alkaryl group containing from about 1 to<br>
3	4<br>
about 14 carbon atoms, R is an alkyl chain containing from 1 to about 8 carbon atoms, R is H<br>
3 or R , and Y is H or a solubilizing group.<br>
The preferred solubilizing groups are -S03"M+, -C02"M+, -S04"M+, -N+(R3)4X" and<br><br>
0
containing from about 1 to about 4 carbon atoms, M is a cation which provides solubility to the bleach activator and X is an anion which provides solubility to the bleach activator. Preferably, M is an alkali metal, ammonium or substituted ammonium cation, with sodium and potassium being most preferred, and X is a halide, hydroxide, methylsulfate or acetate anion.<br>
Preferred bleach activators are those of the above general formula wherein L is selected from the group consisting of:<br>
wherein R3 is as defined above and Y is -SO3-M+  or -CO2 -M+ wherein M is as defined above.<br>
Most preferred among the bleach activators of use in the present invention, are alkanoyloxybenzenesulfonates of the formula:<br><br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein R1 contains from about 7 to about 12, preferably from about 8 to about 11, carbon atoms and M is a suitable cation, such as an alkali metal, ammonium, or substituted ammonium cation, with sodium and potassium being most preferred.<br>
Highly preferred hydrophobic alkanoyloxybenzenesulfonates are selected from the group consisting of nonanoyloxybenzenesulfonate, 3,5,5-trimethylhexanoyloxybenzene-sulfonate, 2-ethylhexanoyloxybenzenesulfonate, octanoyloxybenzenesulfonate, decanoyl-oxybenzenesulfonate, dodecanoyloxybenzenesulfonate, and mixtures thereof.<br>
Alternatively, amido derived bleach activators may be employed in the present invention. These activators are amide substituted compounds of the general formulas:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
or mixtures thereof, wherein R  is an alkyl, aryl, or alkaryl group containing from about 1 to<br>
2 about 14 carbon atoms, R is an alkylene, arylene or alkarylene group containing from about 1<br>
to about 14 carbon atoms, R is H or an alkyl, aryl, or alkaryl group containing from about 1 to about 10 carbon atoms and L is a leaving group as defined above.<br>
Preferred bleach activators are those of the above general formula are wherein R is an<br>
2 alkyl group containing from about 6 to about 12 carbon atoms, R  contains from about 1 to<br>
about 8 carbon atoms, and R is H or methyl. Particularly preferred bleach activators are those<br>
of the above general formulas wherein R  is an alkyl group containing from about 7 to about 10<br>
carbon atoms and R contains from about 4 to about 5 carbon atoms and wherein L is selected from the group consisting of:<br><br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein R is as defined above and Y is-SO3-M+  or-SO3-M+  wherein M is as defined above.<br>
Another important class of bleach activators provide organic peracids as described herein by ring-opening as a consequence of the nucleopbilic attack on the carbonyl carbon of the cyclic ring by the perhydroxide anion. For instance, this ring-opening reaction in caprolactam activators involves attack at the caprolactam ring carbonyl by hydrogen peroxide or its anion. Another example of ring-opening bleach activators can be found in the benzoxazin type activators.<br>
Such activator compounds of the benzoxazin-type, have the formula:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
including the substituted benzoxazins of the type<br>

(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein R is H or an alkyl, aryl, alkoxyaryl, or alkaryl group containing from 1 to 12 carbons.<br>
Caprolactam activators wherein the R moiety contains at least about 6, preferably from 6 to about 12, carbon atoms provide hydrophobic bleaching.<br>
Highly preferred hydrophobic N-acyl caprolactams are selected from the group consisting of benzoyl caprolactam, octanoyl caprolactam, nonanoyl caprolactam, decanoyl caprolactam, undecenoyl caprolactam, 3,5,5-trimethylhexanoyl caprolactam, and mixtures thereof.<br>
Alternatively, a pre-formed peracid may be employed in lieu of the peroxide and activator. The pre-formed hydrophobic peracids are preferably selected from the group consisting of percarboxylic acids and salts, percarbonic acids and salts, perimidic acids and salts, peroxymonosulfuric acids and salts, and mixtures thereof examples of which are described in(U.S. Patent No. 5.576.282 to Miracle et al.<br>
One class of suitable organic peroxycarboxylic acids have the general formula:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein R is an alkylene or substituted alkylene group containing from 1 to about 22 carbon atoms or a phenylene or substituted phenylene group, and Y is hydrogen, halogen, alkyl, aryl, -C(0)OH or-C(0)OOH.<br>
Organic peroxyacids suitable for use in the present invention can contain either one or two peroxy groups and can be either aliphatic or aromatic. When the organic peroxycarboxylic acid is aliphatic, the unsubstituted peracid has the general formula:<br>
Y-(CH2)n-C—O—OH where Y can be, for example, H, CH3, CH2CI, C(0)OH, or C(0)OOH; and n is an integer from 0 to 20. When the organic peroxycarboxylic acid is aromatic, the unsubstituted peracid has the general formula:<br>

The method of the present invention involves providing a non-finished textile component into the bleaching solution as described. The textile component may comprise fibers, yarns and fabrics including wovens, nonwovens and knits. By non-finished, it is intended that the textile component be a material that has not been dyed, printed, or otherwise provided a finishing step such as durable press finish. Of course, one of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that the textile component of the present invention are those that have not been passed through a garment or other manufacturing process involving cutting and sewing of the material.<br>
The present process may be employed with most any natural material including cellulosics such as cotton, linen and regenerated cellulosics such as rayon and lyocell. Both 100% natural fibers, yarns and fabrics may be employed or blends with synthetic materials may be employed as well. For the purposes of the present invention, natural fibers may include cellulosics as described herein, wools both pure and blends, silks, sisal, flax and jute.<br>
As mentioned throughout, the present invention may be employed in both hot batch and hot continuous processing or cold batch processing, all three of which are well known in the art. Hot batch and continuous processing in the present invention involve the application of peroxide bleaching solutions at elevated temperatures ranging from up to about 95 °C with temperatures ranging from about 40 to about 80 °C being more typical and 50-70 ° being most preferred. Reactions times range from 15 to about 180 minutes, more typically 20 to about 120 minutes and most preferably 30 to about 60 minutes with liquor to fabric ratios of from about 5:1 to about 100:1 with about 5:1 to about 40:1 being more preferred and from about 5:1 to about 20:1 being the most preferred for hot batch. For continuous processing, preferred wet pick-up is from about 50% to about 200 weight percent % of the fabric, more preferably from about 50% to about 150% and most preferably from about 70% to about 130%<br>
The cold batch process of the present invention involves pumping the bleaching solution of the present invention into a padding trough and passing a textile component such as a fabric through the trough to saturate the fabric with the bleaching solution. Padding temperatures range from 10 to about 90° C with about 10 to about 50° C being more preferred and from about 20 to about 40° C being most preferred. While fabric pick up of the bleaching solution varies by fabric, typical wet pick up of bleach solution on the fabric ranges from about 50% to about 200% on weight of the fabric, more preferably from about 50% to about 150% and most preferably from about 70% to about 130% by weight on fabric.<br>
Once saturated, the fabric is rolled on a beam, wrapped and treated on a frame for the desired period of time at room temperature. Preferred frames include a rotating A frame and fabric rolls are rotated at specified times to ensure even distribution of the bleaching solution.<br>
Rotation times typically are from about 2 to about 8 hours. Following the requisite treatment time, the treated textile is washed to remove the bleaching solution. One of ordinary skill in the art will of course recognize that conventional cold batch processing equipment may be employed in the method of the present invention.<br>
The method of the present invention may include the further steps of singeing, de-sizing, scouring, and mercerization in conjunction with the bleaching step as are well known in the art. These steps may be performed in various combinations and orders and one of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that varying combinations are possible.<br>
Of course the process of the present invention includes in the preferred applications a washing step or series of washing steps following the method of the present invention. Washing of treated textiles is well known and within the level of skill of the artisan. Washing stages will be typically present after each of the de-sizing, scouring and mercerization steps when present as well as after the bleaching step of the present invention. Washing of treated textiles of the present invention may be performed in known washing equipment such as a jet washing machine. Washing typically involves multiple washings at elevated temperatures followed by step-wise reduction of the temperatures and times across the stages, e.g. approx 80° C for 10 minutes to approx. 70° C for 10 minutes to approx. 28° C for 3 minutes to approx. 70° C for 5 minutes, hi addition, various additives such as chelants and acidic reagents may be added to the rinse solutions if desired. Lastly, the bleaching, de-sizing, scouring or mercerization steps when present may in preferred embodiments include a wet-out or pre-wetting step to ensure even or uniform wettness in the textile component<br>
For purposes of the present invention, fiber degradation or damage is based on fluidity as measured via AATCC test method 82-1996 involving the dispersion of the fibers in cupriethylene diamine (CP). An increase in fluidity between treated fibers and non-treated fibers represents an increase in the amount of fiber damage. The method employed is outlined as follows. A representative sample of fibers of about 1.5 mm is cut and dissolved in CP as defined by the equation CP=120 x sample weight x 0.98 in a specimen bottle with several glass balls, placed under nitrogen. The bottle is shaken for approximately 2 hours. Additional CP is added as defined by the equation CP=80 x sample weight x 0.98 followed by additional shaking under nitrogen for three hours. Following dissolution, the solution is placed under constant stirring to prevent separation of the dispersion. The solution is men measured in a calibrated Oswald Canon Fenske viscometer in a constant temperature bath of 25°C to determine the efflux time. Efflux time is determined by drawing the fluid to a mark between 2 bulbs and measuring the time required for the meniscus to pass from the mark between the bulbs to the mark below the lower<br>
bulb. The average of two times is used. Fluidity is then calculated from the formula F=100/ctd, where c = viscometer constant, t = efflux time and d = density of the solution 1.052. The following non-limiting examples further illustrate the present invention.<br>
EXAMPLE I<br>
A process for the cold batch bleaching woven fabrics according to the present invention may be conducted in the following manner. The bleaching bath is prepared by adding the chemicals as outlined in Table I below to tap water. The addition sequence is as follows: Water-Wetting agent-detergent - Peracid stabilizer/peroxide stabilzer - Activator(when present) - H2O2 - NaOH. The fabric was a unde-sized and unscoured greige plain weave (400R). The original fabric whiteness was 18 on the CIE scale. The bleaching bath is pumped into a padding trough and keep at a constant near full level throughout the padding. The fabric is passed through at a padding speed of 30 m/min. at approx. 24° C, rolled up on a beam and sealed in plastic sheating. The fabric is then rotated on an A-frame at room temperature for the specified reaction time then rinsed thoroughly in a jet washing machine. The bleached fabric is dried and conditioned under 70° F and 65% relative humidity for wetting and whiteness measurements. Miniscan XE Plus made by HunterLab was used to measure CIE Whiteness Index. An Ihstron was used to evaluate the tensile strength by following the method ASTM D 5035. Fluidity was measured by AATCC Test Method 82.<br>

A process for the hot batch bleaching of woven fabrics according to the present invention may be conducted in the following manner. The bleaching solution is formed by preparing a premix of the peracid stabilizer by diluting the respective components to approx. 25% active and adjusting pH with caustic to the range of 5 - 5.5. Following preparation of the stabilizer premix, an bleach precursor premix is prepared by mixing ingredient in the following order: Activator (when present) -Water- Wetting agent - suds suppressor (if desired) and stabilizer premix. The bleaching solution is then prepared and added to a jet machine by adding the following ingredients in the listed order in the machine: Lubricant - bleach precursor mix - Fabric Load -detergent (when present) - H2O2 - NaOH. The liquor/ fabric ratio in the machine is 10:1. The temperature of the solution is raised to 70 °C at 3°Qmin. Upon achieving the temperature, the solution temperature is maintained for 40 minutes followed by draining of the bleaching solution from the machine. The machine is refilled with 70°C water, overflowed for 10 min, and then drain again. A second rinse is conducted by filling the machine with 40°C water, adding acetic acid to pH 6.0 and running the machine for 5 minutes and draining. A third rinse is performed identical to the first and a fourth and final rinse by refilling with cold water, running 5 minutes and draining is conducted. The bleached fabrics are then dried on a tent frame. Tensile strength was measured using ASTM D 5035 (Raveled Strip). Fluidity was measured using AATCC 82. Fabric whiteness was measured using CEElab whiteness index.<br>
