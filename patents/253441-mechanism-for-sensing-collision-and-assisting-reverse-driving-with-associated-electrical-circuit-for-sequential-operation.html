				<td>Mechanism for sensing collision and assisting reverse driving with associated electrical circuit for sequential operation.<br>
Field of application<br>
This invention relates to the field of automobile safety and utility where collision is sensed electro-mechanically just before the actual dash or collision. A sensor is used to generate electrical signal which can be used for activating various safety measures such as shutting the fuel supply, applying automatic brakes, releasing the clutch, activating devices like air bags etc. Similarly the device when fitted to rear side will assist driver while driving in the reverse direction providing a warning in the event of approach of any obstacle e.g a wall or parked vehicle.<br>
Background<br>
Present day vehicles are equipped with safety devices consisting of sensors, usually shock sensors (viz. MEMS accelerometers), which sense the collision and send signal to open safety air bag. This usually needs a very quick response by air bag deployment system. Since the signal is sent after collision takes place, the stringent requirement to protect the human head and body before he or she strikes the front objects (viz dash board, steering wheel front seat etc.) calls for a very quick response of air bag deployment system which in turn is very costly. The response time available is of the order of few milliseconds. If the collision is detected slightly before hand the response time required may be made double or higher. This will have following advantages.<br>
1.	Response time for air bag deployment system is increased, thus a less costly system can be designed.<br>
2.	The signal can be used to apply brakes automatically, releasing the clutch, releasing accelerometer pedal etc., there by decreasing the impact force on vehicle and shock load on transmission &amp; engine components. The transmission &amp; engine components can be reused after minor repairs in some occasions.<br>
If presence of any obstacle (viz. a wall or other stationary or moving vehicle) on rear side is detected then it is helpful to the driver as he or she need not look back continuously through window or through rear viewing mirror (which may not give a good estimation of rear objects) or driver need not depend on another person for guidance.<br>
With above requirements in view a collapsible (foldable) electro-mechanical device is designed which is novel, cost effective and useful.<br><br>

Description of invention<br>
The design is basically a system of arms (links) which open in a definite predetermined manner upon activation. The arms are made to swing out from closed position to the positions shown in Fig.la and Fig.lb in a sequence described later. Any force exerted on any of the arms will cause a mechanical movement and activate a signal which can be used in a multiple ways to bring in various safety measures as described later. The operation of the linkage (a system of arms) is done by using any suitable small DC motors meeting the low speed (typically 4 to 12 RPM) and adequate variable torque requirement.<br>
Brief explanation of the design and operation are given below.<br>
The Design (see Fig.3, Fig.4 &amp; Fig.5)<br>
An arm (1) as shown in Fig.3 &amp; Fig.4 is placed on a support plate (5) and is held in place by a top cover (6) and is free to rotate in one direction w.r.t support plate (5). The arm (1) is held in place by a spring (17) which is attached to support plate (5) through a lug (18) as shovra in Fig.3. The arm (1) is prevented to rotate in the direction opposite to opening direction of arm (1) by a stopper pin (20) which is attached to (5). The top cover (6) is fixed to (5) by a nut (7) so that the arm (1) swings in the gap between (6) and (5). To avoid problem of rattling of arm (1) in the gap between (5) and (6) a roller (32) made of suitable rubber is kept pressed on to (6) as shown in Fig.4. The roller (32) is held by holder (33) which is fixed to (1).<br>
Support plate (5) is attached to the shaft of a suitable motor (4). Motor (4) is fixed to housing (8) as shovra in fig.4 by using metal/hard spacers (34) which are not flexible. A roller (10) is pivoted on a mounting block (11) which in turn is attached to support<br><br>
plate (5) through a rubber pad (12). The roller (10) is kept lightly pressed on to a semicircular collar (9) fitted to the housing (8). The roller (10) is a lined with rubber to reduce vibration problems.<br>
The movement of motor is restricted to a certain angle (typically 120 to 140 degrees) by providing stoppers or stopper blocks (15) [see Fig.5] at the ends of semicircular collar (9), so that the motor (4) is tripped when the roller (10) comes to the stopper and presses a limit switch (35) housed in the stopper or stopper block. Once the roller reaches any end, the roller (10) is prevented from freely moving back by a leaf spring (14) attached to collar (9) in a suitable way such as shown in Fig.5. Only when motor is rotated in opposite direction the roller rides over leaf spring (14) and travels to the other end where similar stopper with limit switch and leaf spring are provided. The surface of leaf spring on which roller rides may be made rough enough by passing a sticker having rough corrugated face. If motor is having self locking (as in stepper motor) then the arrangement of (14), (15) and (35) is not required. Alternately, a electrically engerised clutch may be used to hold the shaft of motor at the ends of its travel)<br>
Arm (1) is made of light material viz. Aluminum or plastic suitably provided with stiffeners to have light weight and good rigidity.<br>
A small motor (21) is fitted at the end of arm (1), the shaft of which carries an arm (2) which initially is parallel with arm (1). This motor (21) is made to rotate by approximately 90 degrees slowly so that the arm (2) can be brought up perpendicular to arm (1). A pulley (22) is fitted to the shaft of motor (21). Another pulley (23) is fitted on to arm (1) at a middle location. A suitable belt (24) connects these two pulleys. Integral with pulley (23) a geared wheel (25) is provided which is engaged with another geared wheel (26) whose axis is perpendicular to axis is of (25). (25) and (26) make a bevel gear set. The geared wheel (26) is having an axially extended central hub. On the hub of (26) a carrier plate (5a) having a central hub, an arm (3) and a cover plate (6a) are fixed in the similar way as that of arm (1). A stopper pin (27) is attached to (6a) to prevent rotation of arm (3) in the direction of opening of arm (1). A spring (29) attached at one end to a block (30) keeps the arm (3) pressed against pin (27), similar to the way in which spring (17) keeps arm (1) pressed against pin (20) in normal situation i.e. until a force is exerted on arm (1).<br>
The gear ratio and pulley diameter ratios are maintained such that when arm (2) rotates by about 90 degrees, the gear (26) rotates by about same angle as that of the rotation of arm (1) i.e. 120 to 140 degrees. The arm (3) is provided with an extension (28), which comes in close vicinity of arm (1) when rotated by an angle 120-140 degrees i.e. when it reaches its extreme position. When a force is exerted on (3) it pushes extended portion of arm (1) against force of spring (29).<br>
The motor (21) is made to rotate by approximately 90 degrees and the motor is stopped and locked at the end of its 90 degree travel by arrangements similar to (15), (35) and (14) fitted between two concentric collars provided on a semicircular plate which in turn is fitted on a bracket; the bracket is attached to the arm (1). A roller (10a) is attached to shaft of motor (21) and the roller (10a) rides on a collar in between above mentioned<br><br>
concentric collars, ine arm (ij provided with a cover (31) Freterably made ot plastic or fiber, as shown in Fig.3 to hide entire mechanism inside when the mechanism is in closed position . Similarly, another cover (36) is provided on other side such that it does not obstruct the movement of arm (3). The whole mechanism can be housed inside bumper of vehicles and the housing (8) is suitably placed on soft mountings (37) to take care of vibration transmission from vehicle to the mechanism.<br>
Operation (see Fig.2 &amp; Fig.6)<br>
For the operation of motors in a definite way a circuit is arranged as shown in Fig.6. The sequence of operation is as follows.<br>
1.	Upon putting the push-pull switch to "open" position the motor (4) operates and arm (1) swings from normal position to final position (by approximately!20 to 140 degrees).<br>
2.	Once the arm (1) reaches its end of desired travel, a normally closed (NC) limit switch (LSo) becomes open and cuts off the supply to motor (4). And another normally open (NO) limit switch (LS) closes the supply circuit to the motor (21).<br><br>
3.	Then the motor (21) takes the arm (2) to its extreme position (i.e. approx 90 degrees from normal close position). A NC limit switch (LSi) is operated by roller (10a) and the supply to (21) is cut off.<br>
4.	While arm (2) rotates it rotates arm (3) through gearing arrangement as described before to the extreme position of arm (3). The final configuration of arms is as shown in Fig.2 / Fig. 1 a / Fig. 1 b.<br>
5. Whenever an object such as another vehicle pushes any these arms, the final effect is to push the arm (1) further in the direction in which it is opened i.e. arm (1) will swing against spring load from (17) to a higher angle i.e. more than 120 to 140 degrees of its normal open position. This extra movement activates a limit switch (19). This closes an electrical circuit giving an output signal. This signal can be used for initiating a variety of actives such as:-<br>
-Alarm<br>
-Danger signal to the other vehicle(s).<br>
-Activating air bag deployment system.<br>
-Activating a mechanism to cut off fuel supply.<br><br>
-Activating a mechanism to apply sudden brakes etc. -Releasing clutch to protect engine from torsional shock.<br>
6.	For normal closure of mechanism (in the likely event of no collision) first, the motor (21) has to rotate in opposite direction by similar angle i.e. approximately 90 degrees. For this the switch (push-pull type) shall be put in "close" position.<br>
7.	When switch is brought to "close" position a switch (S) is closed and supply is made available with reverse polarity to motor (21) through a NC limit switch (LSB).<br>
8.	Just before the arm (2) and (3) reach normal closed position the NO limit switch (LS2) becomes closed and supply with reverse polarity is made available to motor (4). The moment arm (1) moves back from its extreme position the limit switch (LS) becomes open and supply to motor (21) is cut off as the limit switch (LS3) also becomes open at the end of travel of arm (2). It may be noted that the limit switches (LS3) and (LS2) are so arranged at the starting position of arm (2) that firstly (LS2) is operated and after a short gap i.e. after motor (4) is energised with reverse polarity and (LS) becomes open, (LS3) is activated to make it open and cut off the supply to motor (4). For this limit switch (LS2) shall be backed by a small spring (which shall be slightly harder than the spring inside limit switch LS2) in its housing so that roller (10a) will first activate (LS2) and push this whole switch further into its housing i.e. stopper block for pressing the limit switch (LS3) at the end of travel of roller (10a) which is attached to arm (2).<br>
9.	After the arm (1) swings back to its normal closed position and at the end it opens a NC limit switch (LSc), thus cutting off the supply to motor (4).<br>
10.	Oppositely moving or stationery vehicle will touch either arm (2) or (3) or end of arm (1) and the force on either of these arms will cause the arm (1) to swing further away activating the limit switch (19). This limit switch closes a circuit and sends an electrical signal. The extra mechanical movement of arm (1) against spring force from (17) may also be used to mechanically activate any link of another mechanism. The output motion i.e. extra motion can be transferred mechanically to other mechanisms used to activate brake or releasing the accelerator pedal etc.<br>
11.	The mechanism, when fitted to the rear of a vehicle (preferably in the bumper location i.e. in a slot in the bumper), is useful for the driver as he can drive in backward direction (e.g. while parking a vehicle) without seeing continuously backside through window or through rear mirror (which does not give a good estimate). Whenever an obstacle is touched by the mechanism a signal can be given to driver so that he can apply brakes. Alternately, auto braking can be employed by suitable means.<br><br>
The above explained device is to be used in pairs and shall be placed symmetrically about longitudinal axis of the automobile, either at front or rear or on both sides, in the pockets made in bumpers. The design features of the devices in a pair are mirror images of each other.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

A new device is designed which when fitted in a pair to the front of automobile, preferable in bumper location, and opened can detect any collision little before the actual collision takes place and can activate various safety systems viz. deployment of air bags ,applying of brakes , cutting off fuel supply or releasing of clutch etc. When fitted in the rear of automobile in a pair, preferably in bumper location, it can assist driver while driving in reverse direction by giving an indication of presence of an obstacle (viz. a wall or another vehicle etc.). An electrical circuit is also designed to operate the two motors of each device in a sequential manner employing a two position push-pull type of mechanical switch. The essential advantage of the new system over the present shock sensors for deployment of air bags is that the warning comes few milliseconds before the collision and hence offers two advantages i.e. (i) the driver and passengers get protection before they experience the shock and (ii) time available for response of the air bag deployment is more, allowing a cheaper air bag deployment system can be designed.</td>
