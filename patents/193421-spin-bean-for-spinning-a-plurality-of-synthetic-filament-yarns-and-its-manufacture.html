The invention relates to a spin beam for spinning a plurality of synthetic filament yarns and its manufacture.<br>
A spin beam of this type is known from German Patent No. 22 18 239, wherein the spin beam is constructed as a hollow body, which is internally heated by a liquid medium.  Melt lines are laid in the hollow body.  The manufacture of such a spin beam is very expensive.<br>
It is therefore the object of the invention to further develop the known spin beam, so as to simplify its manufacture and to ensure that the melt carrying components, which are under a very high pressure (more than 100 bars) can be made pressure-tight and tested in a simple manner.<br>
This object is achieved by the present invention in that it provides for a spin beam having the features of claim 1, and a method comprising the steps of claim 12. Advantageous further developments are subject matter of the dependent claims.<br>
The solution is characterized in that, departing from conventional manufacturing methods, the spin beam is not constructed as a hollow body, in which the line systems are subsequently integrated.  Rather, the spin beam is constructed from the inside out, in that initially the melt carrying parts are assembled as a self-supporting   structural unit, and that the spin beam is subsequently<br><br>
constructed around this structural unit.  This allows to manufacture first a structural unit containing the melt carrying parts, and to perform on this unit the necessary and desired pressure and quality tests, without being thereby hindered by the housing.<br>
A far reaching prefabrication of the spin beam and its stability can be achieved in that especially the side walls of the spin beam are constructed as channel sections.<br>
The embodiment of claim 3 serves likewise both the stability and the simplified manufacture.  It guarantees in particular a dimensional accuracy of the upper support carrying the pump connection and other connections.  The same applies to the configuration of claim 4.  In this embodiment, the side walls of the lower support may be made so long that they enclose between them the spin heads and, thus, provide for a satisfactory heat control in the spin heads.  In this arrangement, it is provided in particular that the side walls of the lower support are welded at their bottommost edges to the walls extending transversely from the side walls forming the spin beam.  This allows to accomplish that the thus-formed box encloses the U-shaped section of the lower support on all sides, and leaves open only the opening of the U-shaped section for the exit of the filaments.<br>
The embodiment of claim 6 allows to achieve a further improvement of the heat control in the spin heads.<br>
In this embodiment, the lower support is constructed as a solid, metallic parallelepiped block.  Arranged in the block are vertical holes in a desired space relationship.<br>
These holes enclose the spin heads leaving a small gap therebetween.  It is again preferred that the lower edges of the block are welded to the wall transverse of the side   walls forming the spin beam, so that the box encloses the<br><br>
block forming the lower support on three sides.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, the distributor unit is connected to the lower support via special connecting extensions.  The advantage lies in that the connection of the spinneret to the respective distribution line becomes independent of the relatively coarse tolerance, at which the lower support is made at a moderate cost of manufacture.  To this end, the connection plate maybe mounted on the downward-directed base plate of the lower support.  However, for a connection of round spin heads, the embodiment of claim 9 is especially suitable.<br>
The spin beam of the invention has the further, special advantage that it can be made in any desired size, i.e., the possibilities of manufacture and construction do not limit the size.  For this reason, the spin beam can also accommodate several distributor units, which are each supplied by one multiple pump.  Until now, for supplying several pumps with melt that advances from an extruder, it has been necessary to provide a complicated line system, in which each line is surrounded by a double jacket, so that the inner melt line is heated by an external jacket of vapor or fluid.  The cost of such double-jacket pipes is especially high, when all lines between the extruder and the respective pump are to be of the same length, i.e., when the pipes must be bent.<br>
This problem is eliminated by the further development of the invention as claimed in claim 10.  In this embodiment, the melt lines leading into the spin beam, the so-called "melt distributor block", which forms the end of the melt supply line, as well as the pump lines leading to the individual pumps are connected to the respective pump connection plate and integrated to a   distributor unit.<br><br>
in the following, embodiments of the invention are described. In this context, certain preferred sequences in the construction of spin beams that are considered especially favourable will be indicated by way of example. However, several sequences are feasible in the construction of the outer walls of the spin beam and for their mounting to the prefabricated, self-supporting distributor unit since in the construction of a parallelepiped box is does not necessarily matter how the walls are placed on top of each other. Therefore, the intention also includes modified sequences with the same result.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a spin beam, in particular for spinning a plurality of synthetic filament yarns, the beam having the shape of an elongate, hollow parallelepiped block, which is formed by two side walls, a lower wall, an upper wall, and end plates, said spin beam comprising a number of pressure-tight spm heads with downwardly directed spinnerets arranged in one row on a lower support; at least one multiple pump arranged on an upper support: distribution hnes connecting the respective multiple pump to the spin heads; a pump connection plate joined to the upper support being provided for each multiple pump; each distribution line being connected on the one hand to the pump cormection plate and on the other hand to the spin head, the distribution lines forming together with the pump connection plate and the spin head a self-supporting distributor unit, and at least the lower support forming at least one portion of the lower wall of the spin beam, and the side walls, the end walls, and the upper wall being joined to one another in desired sequence and mounted respectively on the lower and upper support of the self-supporting distributor unit.<br><br><br>
The prcsent invention also provides a method of manufaeturing a spin beam as herein above described, the lower wall of the spin beam mounting at least in one row in the axial direction of the spin beam a plurality of pressure-tight spin heads with downwardly extending spinnerets; the upper wall of the spin beam mounting, preferably in the axial center above a certain number of spinnerets, at least one multiple pump, which is connected via a melt supply line to an extruder and via bent but equally long melt supply lines to the spin heads, the method comprising the steps of connecting the melt supply lines on the one hand to a pump connection plate and on the other hand to a lower support to form a self-supporting distributor unit; assembling around the self-supporting distributor unit in a desired sequence the outside walls of the spin beam and welding same to one another and to the distributor unit.<br>

The following description applies to all embodiments.  Deviations will be specifically indicated.<br>
A spin beam 1 is formed by two side walls 2 and<br>
3	as well as by an upper support 4 and a lower support 8.<br>
The side walls 2 and 3 are made with a U-shaped cross<br>
section, their horizontal transverse walls 5 and 6 forming respectively a portion of the upper wall and the lower wall of spin beam 1.  The upper support 4 has likewise a U-shaped cross section.  It extends over the entire length of the spin beam 1.  Over its length, it is provided in its base plate with several holes, which serve for receiving and welding a pump connection plate 10, as will be described further below.<br>
With its side walls 7 the upper support 4 is welded respectively to the transverse walls 5 of side walls 2 and 3.  The U-shaped opening of the upper support<br>
4	is directed upwardly.  Its upward directed base surface<br>
of the channel section mounts in pressure-tight manner,<br>
via an intermediate plate 11, a multiple pump 12 on a<br>
connection plate 10.  The multiple pump 12 is driven by a<br>
pump shaft (drive shaft) 13.  The multiple pump 12 is a<br>
gear pump, in which a melt flow is distributed over<br>
several pump chambers and thereafter distributed over<br>
several melt supply lines 14.<br>
One melt supply line 23 extends into spin beam 1.  This melt supply line 23 extends through the base plate of upper support 4 and connects then to a distributor 25.  From distributor 25, the melt is   distributed over melt distribution lines 26, each of which<br><br>
leads to the pump connection plate 10 of each of the pumps.<br>
In the embodiment having a total of twelve spinnerets, two pump connection plates 10 and two multiple pumps 12 are provided.  Each pump connection plate 10 overlies six spinnerets 18 in the center thereof.  Through melt distribution line 26, the melt flows to multiple pump 12, the latter distributing the melt to six distribution lines 14.  Each distribution line 14 leads to one spinneret 18, by terminating, via a channel 28, in spin head 17.<br>
It should be emphasized that in all embodiments the spin head 17 may be constructed identical with round spinnerets.  In the embodiment of Figure 3, the spin head 17 is rectangular in its horizontal section.  The spin heads 17 are mounted on lower support 8.<br>
In the embodiment of Figure 1, the lower support 8 has a U-shaped cross section.  The side walls 16 of U-shaped support 8 are directed downwardly, and they are welded at their lower edge to the transverse walls 6 of side walls 2, 3.  The base plate of support 8 has several holes, which are equally spaced apart from one another, for example twelve holes, as will be described further below.  Inserted into these holes and welded to support 8 are connection plates 9.  Each of connection plates 9 extends with an extension 20 into the U-shaped opening of support 8.  On its peripheral surface, the extension 20 is provided with a screw thread.  Connected to this screw thread by screwing is spin head 17, which has a correspondingly mating screw thread on its inner surface. Inserted into the bottom of spin head 17 is a spinneret 18.  A piston 21 is operative in the spin head 17.  This piston 21 is sealed against the lower extension 20 of   connection plate 9 by a round seal 22 which surrounds a<br><br>
supply line 28.  On its side facing spinneret 18, the piston 21 is sealed by a diaphragm 24.  The melt line extends through the piston and the diaphragm in the center thereof.  In the pressureless state, the diaphragm rests against the piston under a slight expansion force, and pushes it by means of seal ring 22 against the lower front end of extension 20 of connection plate 9.  Under the pressure of the melt entering into the spin head 17, diaphragm 24 lies against the piston and the gap surrounding this piston, and thereby seals the piston.  At the same time, seal ring 22 is pressed under the necessary sealing force against extension 20 of connection plate 9.<br>
The spin pack accommodated in spin head 17 is thus preferably self-sealing.<br>
In the embodiment of Figure 2, the lower support 8 is constructed as a solid, parallelepiped metal block. This block is penetrated by a number of holes, twelve in the embodiment. The upper side of each hole is closed by connection plate 9.  The lower extension 20 of connection plate 9 extends downwardly into the hole.  Again, as described above, this extension can receive a spin head 17 by screwing it thereto.  The spin head is identical with that of Figure 1 and its pertinent description.<br>
In the embodiment of Figure 3, the lower support 8 is constructed as a relatively wide channel section. The vertical walls 16 of the channel section are welded to the transverse walls 6 of side walls 2 and 3.  The underside of the base plate of support 8 mounts a connection plate 27.  Screwed in pressure-tight manner to the underside of this connection plate 27 is the rectangular spin head 17.  In spin head 17, one of the melt supply lines 28 terminates by extending through the base plate of support 8 as well as connection plate 27.   Inserted into the bottom of spin head 17 is a rectangular<br><br>
spinneret 18.<br>
In all embodiments, two distributor units serve as the essential operative elements and simultaneously as structural components of the spin beams.  The distributor units are constructed first and tested for pressure tightness.  In the embodiments of Figures 1 and 2, each distributor unit consists of lower support 8, the twelve connection plates 9 joined thereto by welding, the twelve melt supply lines 14 welded thereto, and pump connection plate 10.  The melt supply line 26 leads to melt distributor 25, and each of melt lines 14 leads to pump connection plate 10.<br>
Initially, the melt supply lines 14 are made of the same length, and then bent, so that their ends have each the predetermined distance between pump connection plate 10 on the one hand and one of the spinneret connection plates 9 on the other.  These ends are then welded to each of these plates.  Subsequently, all connection plates 9 are inserted into the corresponding holes provided in the base plates of the lower support 8 and welded thereto.  Furthermore, the melt distribution lines 26 are made of the same length and bent, so that their ends have each the predetermined distance between melt distributor 25 and each of the pump connection plates 10.  Subsequently, the ends are welded to pump connection plate 10 on the one hand and melt distributor 25 on the other.  Further welded to melt distributor 25 is melt line 23, which is to extend later through the upper support.<br>
As shown in Figure 4, in this manner a complete distributor unit is formed for a total of twelve spinnerets, from which twelve yarns can be spun.  This distributor unit can be constructed without obstruction by components surrounding same, and be tested in particular   for compressive strength and tightness.<br><br>
Figure 6 is a top view illustrating the layout of the melt supply lines 14 leading from pump connection plate 10 to the individual connection plates 9.<br>
Figure 7 corresponds to Figure 4 for the embodiment of Figure 2, wherein the lower support is constructed as a solid block with holes.<br>
Figure 10 illustrates a distributor unit for the embodiment of Figure 3, which has no connection plates 9, but in which the melt supply lines 14 are welded each to smaller holes provided in the base plate of lower support 8.<br>
In the spin beam of Figure 12, two rows of spinnerets 18 are arranged parallel to each other on the underside of spin beam 1.  Each row of spinnerets 18 is supplied via a distributor unit and one of pumps 12,  As regards the construction of the distributor units, the foregoing descriptions are herewith incorporated by reference.  Illustrated is an embodiment in accordance with Figure 1 and Figure 4.  The lower support 8 is present in duplicate.  Shown are lower supports 8 corresponding to Figure 1.  Possible, however, is also a configuration corresponding to Figure 2 or Figure 3.<br>
The construction of the upper support of Figure 12 differs from the embodiments of Figure 1, 2, or 3.  The upper support 4 is a channel section with a base plate and side walls 7.  The upper support 4 extends crosswise to the axial direction of spin beam 1 between the two side walls 2 and 3.  The upper support 4 has in its bottom two holes, adapted to receive pump connection plate 10 with intermediate plate 11.  Upon completion of the two distributor units, the upper support 4 is tightly welded to the two pump connection plates 10 or intermediate plates 11 of the two distributor units.<br>
  In the illustrated embodiment, the side walls 2<br><br>
or 3 have transverse walls 6 each extending perpendicularly from side wall 2 or side wall 3.  The side walls 2, 3 together with their transverse walls 6 are welded to one of the lower supports 8.  The upper end of the spin beam is formed by upper support 4 as well as laterally adjacent cover plates 29.<br>
In the case of this spin beam with two parallel rows of spinnerets, the construction principle of this invention is of special importance.  It allows to assemble first the distributor units each individually and to test same for tightness.  This test would not be possible, were the approach different.  Only upon completion and testing the distributor units is the spin beam assembled, in that the distributor units are initially interconnected by upper support 4, and that the lower supports 8 are then joined to the side walls 2, or vice versa.  Subsequently the upper support 4 is welded to the side walls 2 and 3. As shown in Figure 13, the side walls 2, 3 have a recess in their upper edge which is adapted to receive the upper support 4 with its side walls 7.<br>
Subsequently, the spin beam is closed by cover plates 29 on its upper side, and by an intermediate plate 30 between the two lower supports 8, as well as by end plates 31 at the axial ends of the spin beam.<br>
All embodiments of the spin beams are closed at their axial ends by end plates 31,<br>
Referring to all embodiments, upon completion of the distributor units, the assembly continues in that the pump connection plates and upper plate 11 are joined to one another; and that melt line 23 is welded into the upper plate so as to extend therethrough.  A double jacket 15 that surrounds the melt line 23 and forms therewith an annular space, is welded to the upper plate such that the   annular space terminates at the upper plate.  The annular<br><br>
space is supplied with a heating medium.<br>
Subsequently, the transverse walls 5 and 6 of side walls 2, 3 are welded respectively to the upper and the lower support, thereby forming the parallelepiped beam.  It should be remarked that a vapor line for heating the spin beam and a condensate drain line not shown terminate in the hollow space of the spin beam.  The vapor permits a uniform heating inside the spin beam.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
