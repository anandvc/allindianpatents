CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
The present application a continuation-in-part of co-pending United States<br>
patent application serial no. 11/146522, filed on June 7,2005, which is a<br>
continuation-in-part of co-pending United States patent application serial no.<br>
11/043830, filed on January 26,2005, which claims priority to United States<br>
provisional patent application serial no. 60/543722, filed on February 11, 2004.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates generally to devices and methods for selectively<br>
stimulating parts of the body, and more particularly to devices and method for<br>
selectively stimulating various nerves or selectively applying electrical stimulation to<br>
various other body parts.<br>
2.	Background Discussion<br>
Women account for more than 11 million incontinence cases. One type of<br>
incontinence is stress urinary incontinence (SUl), where women experience<br>
involuntary loss of urine during normal daily activities and movements, such as<br>
laughing, coughing, sneezing and regular exercise. SUl may be caused by a<br>
functional defect of the tissue or ligaments connecting the vaginal wall with the pelvic<br>
muscles and pubic bone. Common causes include repetitive straining of the pelvic<br>
muscles, childbirth, loss of pelvic muscle tone, and estrogen loss. Such a defect<br>
results in an improperly functioning urethra. Unlike other types of incontinence, SUl<br>
is not a problem of the bladder.<br>
Where stress incontinence is typically a result of an anatomical defect,<br>
another form of incontinence, urge incontinence, appears to be neurologically based<br>
and generally revealed as detrusor muscle instability or "bladder spasms." As such it<br>
is usually not conducive to surgical correction. Urge incontinence may or may not<br><br>
result in urine leakage, but both conditions otherwise have similar symptoms and<br>
similar forms of treatment, which generally include a combination of behavioral<br>
modification (learned strategies for reducing the urge sensation, scheduled voiding,<br>
avoidance of bladder-stimulating substances such as caffeine, and pelvic muscle<br>
exercises, with or without biofeedback) and drug therapy (typically anticholinergeic<br>
agents such as oxybutynin or tolterodine). These treatments require life-long<br>
therapy. Unfortunately, behavioral modification requires continuous effort to maintain<br>
results and the available drugs have significant side effects for many patients<br>
causing 80% to discontinue therapy within a year. The alternative therapy is to<br>
modify lifestyle to accommodate the condition - frequent urination to avoid<br>
"accidents" and wearing protective pads or undergarments, depending on the<br>
severity of the condition.<br>
Another approach for treatment is stimulation of the sacral and/or pudendal<br>
nerve. The sacral spinal nerve roots separate in pairs to exit laterally through the<br>
nerve root foramina. The main destinations for these roots are the sacral plexus.<br>
Nerves from this plexus provide the motor and sensory innervation of the lower<br>
limbs and pelvic organs. Specifically, the sacral plexus splits into five sacral nerve<br>
pair, sacral spinal nerves S1 to S5. These nerves supply the thighs and lower<br>
parts of the legs, the feet, most of the external genital organs, and the area<br>
around the anus. The pudendal nerve is the largest branch of the pudendal plexus<br>
and is composed of somatosensory, somatomotor and autonomic elements derived<br>
from the anterior primary divisions of the second, third and fourth sacral nerves. The<br>
pudendal nerve affects the function of the bladder, urethral sphincter and genitals.<br>
Lower branches of the pudendal nerve contribute to peristalsis of the colon and anal<br>
sphincter contraction force. The pudendal nerve is closer to the bladder, and its<br>
stimulation innervates the bladder, thus eliminating or lessening its contractions. At<br>
least one known commercial device stimulates the sacral nerve through a needle<br>
extended into the sacral nerve bundle. This device, however, supplies a continuous<br>
signal to provide constant stimulation of the nerve. Various drawbacks of this device<br>
include its invasive nature, and unwanted stimulation effects on other areas of the<br>
body, since the sacral nerve as a whole is being stimulated and multiple other areas<br><br>
of the body are innervated by such stimulation (i.e., resulting in leg twitches or the<br>
like).<br>
A company called Advanced Bionics has an implantable stimulation device<br>
that targets the pudendal nerve specifically rather than the sacral nerve. This<br>
device is implanted in the vicinity of the pudendal nerve, but also is invasive and<br>
supplies a constant signal as described above and therefore, has the same<br>
drawbacks.<br>
In addition to incontinence, women can suffer from other diseases as well,<br>
often simultaneously with incontinence. Interstitial cystitis is a chronic bladder<br>
condition involving an inflamed or irritated bladder wall. Patients with this<br>
condition may experience mild discomfort, pressure, tenderness, or intense pain<br>
in the bladder and surrounding pelvic area. Other symptoms may include an<br>
urgent need to urinate (urgency), frequent need to urinate (frequency), or a<br>
combination of these symptoms. The inflammation can lead to scarring and<br>
stiffening of the bladder, less bladder capacity (the bladder is able to hold less<br>
urine), and pinpoint bleeding in the bladder lining. In rare cases, ulcers form in the<br>
bladder lining. Of the more than 700,000 Americans estimated to have interstitial<br>
cystitis, about 90 percent are women.<br>
Treatments for interstitial cystitis include oral medicines, such as aspirin,<br>
ibuprofen, other painkillers, antidepressants and antihistamines. Another<br>
treatment is bladder instillation (a bladder wash or bath) in which the bladder is<br>
filled with a solution that is held for varying periods of time before being emptied.<br>
These treatments require life-long therapy. Sacral nerve stimulation implants are<br>
also used for the treatment of interstitial cystitis, but, as stated previously, its<br>
invasive nature and unwanted stimulation effects on other areas of the body make<br>
this treatment undesirable. Surgery, considered a treatment of last resort, does not<br>
necessarily improve symptoms.<br>
Other diseases that may occur simultaneously with urinary incontinence<br>
include fecal and anal incontinence. Fecal incontinence is the inability to control<br>
the bowels, and can have several causes with constipation being the most<br>
common. Fecal incontinence can also be caused by injury to one or both of the<br><br>
ring-like muscles at the end of the rectum called the anal internal and/or external<br>
sphincters. In women, the damage often happens when giving birth. Hemorrhoid<br>
surgery can damage the sphincters as well. Fecal incontinence can also be<br>
caused by damage to the nerves that control the anal sphincters or to the nerves<br>
that sense stool in the rectum. Nerve damage can also be caused by childbirth, a<br>
long-term habit of straining to pass stool, stroke, and diseases that affect the<br>
nerves, such as diabetes and multiple sclerosis. In addition, rectal surgery,<br>
radiation treatment, and inflammatory bowel disease can cause scarring that<br>
makes the walls of the rectum stiff and less elastic. Abnormalities of the pelvic<br>
floor, which is typically caused by childbirth, can also lead to fecal incontinence.<br>
Examples of some abnormalities are decreased perception of rectal sensation,<br>
decreased anal canal pressures, decreased squeeze pressure of the anal canal,<br>
impaired anal sensation, a dropping down of the rectum (rectal prolapse),<br>
protrusion of the rectum through the vagina (rectocele), and/or generalized<br>
weakness and sagging of the pelvic floor. Treatment depends on the cause and<br>
severity of fecal incontinence, and may include dietary changes, medication,<br>
bowel training, or surgery. A last resort is a colostomy, which is the surgical<br>
creation of an opening between the large intestine and the abdominal wall. More<br>
than one treatment may be necessary for successful control since continence is a<br>
complicated chain of events.<br>
One type of treatment typically cannot be used to treat the different conditions<br>
described above, and, as indicated above, many of the known treatments are<br>
invasive or have other negative side effects. Accordingly, what is needed is an<br>
improved device and method for simultaneously treating different diseases or<br>
conditions.<br>

abdominal or sacral regions of the mammal's body.<br>
According to one embodiment, the device further includes a return<br>
electrode for receiving the signal package, wherein the first electrode and return<br>
electrode are both positioned external of and substantially adjacent to the skin of<br>
the mammal, and relative to each other such that the applied signal package may<br>
pass from the first electrode to the return electrode substantially without passing<br>
through tissue of the mammal. The first and second predetermined body parts<br>

first modulator modulates the first waveform and second carrier waveform to<br>
create a first modulated signal, and wherein the second modulator modulates the<br>
first modulated signal, third waveform, and fourth carrier waveform to create the<br>
modulated signal package, and wherein the fourth waveform generator generates<br>
the fourth waveform only during periods of inactivity of the first modulated signal.<br>
The present invention also provides a transcutaneous electrical stimulation<br>

first frequency and capable of stimulating a second predetermined nerve or nerve<br>
branch. The device further includes a modulation device electrically coupled to<br>
the first, second and third waveform generators and adapted to modulate the<br>
second carrier waveform with the first and third waveforms to create a modulated<br>
signal package, and an electrode electrically coupled to the modulation device<br>
and positioned substantially adjacent to the skin of the mammal, and adapted to<br>
apply the modulated signal package thereto. This embodiment may also include<br>
any of the variation described above.<br><br>
In addition, the present invention provides a method for transcutaneous^<br>
and selectively stimulating more than one body part within a mammal. The<br>

modulating step comprises the steps of modulating the first waveform and second<br>
carrier waveform to create a first modulated signal, and modulating the third<br>
waveform and fourth carrier waveform to create a second modulated signal.<br>
In yet another embodiment, the modulating step further includes<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Before explaining the present invention in detail, it should be noted that the<br>
invention is not limited in its application or use to the details of construction and<br>
arrangement of parts illustrated in the accompanying drawings and description.<br>
The illustrative embodiments of the invention may be implemented or incorporated<br>
in other embodiments, variations and modifications, and may be practiced or<br>
carried out in various ways. For example, although the present invention is<br>
described in detail in relation to nerve stimulation in females, it is to be understood<br><br>
that it can be readily adapted for use in males, and children as well as adults. The<br>
inventive principles, apparatus and methods disclosed herein may also have<br>
application for stimulating various other nerves, either independently or<br>
simultaneously, such as stimulation of nerves during labor and delivery, or<br>
selectively stimulating branches of a given nerve bundle to selectively address<br>
different patient conditions. Thus, the present invention can, for example, be used<br>
to selectively treat or affect one or more of the following conditions<br>
simultaneously: stress urinary incontinence, anal and fecal incontinence, sexual<br>
dysfunction, interstitial cystitis, chronic pain such as but not limited to pelvic pain,<br>
nocturia, and gastrointestinal disorders such as but not limited to gastric pacing.<br>
Finally, the present invention as described herein can also be used to stimulate<br>
body parts other than nerves, such as glands that secrete hormones, and large<br>
muscle groups, such as biceps muscle stimulation associated with physical<br>
therapy.<br>
One unique aspect of the invention described herein is the manner in which<br>
the nerve(s) or other body parts are stimulated, which is transdermally rather than<br>
via a needle or other invasive element inserted within the body in close proximity<br>
to the nerve. This has obvious advantages in comfort for the patient, but also<br>
eliminates the surgical risk of mistakenly injuring other nerves or vessels. The<br>
system provides direct, but preferably selective stimulation to a nerve or the like<br>
that may be, if desired, controlled in part based on biofeedback data<br>
corresponding to physiological conditions sensed in the body, such as bladder<br>
contractions.<br>
With regard to its application for stimulating nerves, an underlying principal<br>
of its operation is the fact that nerves within the body can be selectively targeted<br>
for stimulation without affecting adjacent neurons. As is well known to those<br>
skilled in the art, bioelectric potentials are produced as a result of electrochemical<br>
activity of excitable cells found within nervous system tissue. These excitable<br>
cells exist in two electrical states, resting potential or action potential. Cells<br>
remain in the resting potential state until adequate stimulus is provided to cause<br>
the cell to reach the action or threshold potential, at which time the nerve "fires,"<br><br>
and the action potential travels at a constant conduction velocity unattenuated<br>
along the cell membranes. This all-or-nothing response of the action potential<br>
causes the cell's membrane potential to go through a characteristic repeatable<br>
cycle, where the potential first goes from the negative resting potential, to a<br>
positive action potential, and then back down to the negative resting potential<br>
again all within approximately 1 ms. The response remains the same regardless<br>
of the magnitude of the stimulus, so long as it exceeds the threshold potential.<br>
As is also well known, when an excitable cell membrane has an action<br>
potential response (from an adequate stimulus), its ability to respond to a second<br>
stimulus is significantly altered. During the initial, depolarizing portion of the<br>
action potential, the cell membrane cannot respond to additional stimulus<br>
regardless of its intensity. This period is referred to as the absolute refractory<br>
period. Immediately following the absolute refractory period is the relative<br>
refractory period where the cell membrane can respond only to intense<br>
stimulation. The existence of the absolute and relative refractory periods results<br>
in an upper frequency limit at which a cell can be repeatedly discharged. Thus,<br>
neurons can be seen as frequency dependent devices. The frequency dependent<br>
component of the neuron depends on its total capacitance, which will vary from<br>
neuron to neuron and will be a function of its length, diameter, coating<br>
(myelination) and the permeativity of the dielectric medium. In other words, for<br>
any given dielectric medium, varying either the length or diameter of the neuron,<br>
or its myelination, will vary its total capacitance.<br>
Since neurons in the human body do vary greatly in diameter, length and<br>
myelination, the capacitance and conduction velocity (operating frequency) for<br>
these neurons vary as well. Using these differences in physical characteristics of<br>
adjacent neurons, selected nerves can be targeted for stimulation without<br>
affecting adjacent neurons. That is, selective neural stimulation can be achieved<br>
by characterizing the frequency response (capacitance) of adjacent neurons, and<br>
tuning the stimulation frequency to an area of no-overlap. For example, consider<br>
two adjacent neurons, where neuron A has a frequency band of operation from 0-<br>
20 Hz, and neuron B has a frequency band of operation from 20-30 Hz. Thus,<br><br>
within the frequency band of 20-30 Hz, neuron B can be selectively stimulated<br>
with no effect on neuron A. Further, neuron A can be selectively stimulated even<br>
in an overlapping frequency range if stimulation is applied during neuron B's<br>
absolute refractory period, during which no amount of stimulation will cause<br>
neuron B to fire as discussed above, or if the stimulation is less than the<br>
magnitude required to cause stimulation during the relative refractory period. As<br>
described further below, these principles can be applied to achieve selective<br>
stimulation of two or more nerves within the body.<br>
As indicated above, it is known that surface electrodes can be used to<br>
stimulate both nerves and muscles within the body. One problem that is<br>
encountered, however, is that the applied electrical signals tend to spread widely,<br>
affecting untargeted muscles and nerves as well as targeted ones, which is often<br>
undesirable. Further, to account for this signal dissipation, the applied current<br>
levels must be significantly increased to ensure adequate current densities at the<br>
targeted site. Another challenge associated with transdermal application of<br>
electrical signals is the fact that some nerves are stimulated by a low frequency<br>
signal, such as the pudendal nerve which is stimulated by a frequency on the<br>
order of 10-40 Hz. Such a low frequency signal cannot itself pass through body<br>
tissue, and therefore is not conducive to direct transdermal application. Many of<br>
these challenges have been overcome by the devices described in detail below.<br>
Fig. 1 illustrates schematically an exemplary transdermal signal<br>
transmission device 100 in accordance with the present invention. The signal<br>
transmitter is preferably contained within a transdermal patch 101 or the like that<br>
can be removably secured to the surface of the skin, preferably in the lower<br>
abdominal region or lower sacrum of the patient. The patch may be any suitable<br>
adhesive bandage or the like, such as the exemplary embodiment shown in Fig.<br>
11 that will be described further below.<br>
The signal transmitter 100 includes a suitable power source 102 such as a<br>
lithium ion film battery by CYMBET™ Corp. of Elk River, Minnesota, model<br>
number CPF141490L, and at least first 104, second 106 and third 107 waveform<br>
generators that are electrically coupled to and powered by the battery. These<br><br>
waveform generators may be of any suitable type, such as those sold by Texas<br>
Instruments of Dallas, Texas under model number NE555. The first waveform<br>
generator 104 generates a first waveform 202 (see Fig. 2a) or signal having a<br>
frequency known to stimulate a first selected body part, such as the pudendal<br>
nerve, which is known to be stimulated by a frequency approximately within the<br>
range of 10-30Hz. As indicated above, such a low frequency signal applied to the<br>
skin, in and of itself, cannot pass through body tissue to reach the pudendal nerve<br>
with sufficient current density to stimulate the nerve. Thus, the second waveform<br>
generator 106 is provided to generate a higher frequency carrier waveform 204,<br>
which is applied along with the first waveform to an amplitude modulator 108,<br>
such as an On-Semi MC1496 modulator by Texas Instruments. The first<br>
waveform is preferably a square wave having a frequency of approximately 10-30<br>
Hz, and the second waveform is preferably a sinusoidal signal having a frequency<br>
in the range of 10-400 KHz. As those skilled in the art will readily recognize,<br>
modulation of this first waveform 202 with the second waveform (carrier<br>
waveform) 204 results in a modulated waveform or signal 206 having generally<br>
the configuration shown in Fig. 2a. The signals shown in Figs. 2a and 2b are for<br>
illustrative purposes only, and are not intended as true representations of the<br>
exemplary signals described herein.<br>
As described in detail in co-pending U.S. Patent Application Ser. No.<br>
11/146,522, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety, this<br>
modulated signal 206 can be provided to an appropriate surface electrode 110,<br>
such as DURA-STICK Self Adhesive Electrodes from Chattanooga Group, Inc. of<br>
Hixson, TN, that applies the modulated waveform directly to the skin. As is readily<br>
understood by those skilled in the art, the use of the modulated signal enables<br>
transmission of the waveform through tissue due to the high frequency nature of<br>
the carrier waveform, yet allows it to be detected (and responded to) by the<br>
pudendal nerve due to the low frequency envelope of the modulated signal.<br>
Rather than simply applying modulated signal 206 to selectively affect one<br>
nerve, the modulated signal 206 has periodic periods of inactivity 209 that can<br>
further be taken advantage of to generate a signal package capable of<br><br>
transdermally and selectively stimulating two or more nerves or other body parts.<br>
To accomplish this, a third waveform generator 107 generates a third waveform<br>
having a frequency different from the first waveform and that is specifically<br>
selected to stimulate a second nerve or body part. An exemplary third waveform<br>
210 is shown in Fig. 2. This third waveform must be out of phase with the first<br>
waveform 202 to avoid interfering with modulated signal 206. Further, if the<br>
frequency ranges that simulate first and second nerves overlap, the third<br>
waveform can be generated or applied during the refractory period of the first<br>
nerve to ensure the first nerves inability to respond to this subsequent stimulus.<br>
The first 202, second 204 and third 210 waveforms are all applied to amplitude<br>
modulator 108, which modulates the three waveforms into a modulated signal<br>
package 212. The term "signal package" is used herein to describe a single<br>
output signal consisting or three or more individual signals modulated together in<br>
any way.<br>
As indicated above, the first and third waveform generators generate their<br>
respective waveforms 202, 210 out of phase with each other so that when<br>
combined with the carrier waveform 204 they appear along separate and discrete<br>
portions of the signal package 212, and each of the first and third waveforms have<br>
a frequency selected to specifically target different nerves or body portions. For<br>
example, the first waveform 202 may have a frequency of 20 Hz, which is known<br>
to have an effect on the autonomic element branches of the pudendal nerve which<br>
is known to affect overactive bladder, and the third waveform may have a<br>
frequency of 10 Hz, which is known to have an effect on the somatomotor branch<br>
of the pudendal nerve that is useful in treating intersticial cystitis. To the extent<br>
there is an overlap in frequency ranges, the third waveform can be applied during<br>
the refractory period of the first nerve as previously stated.<br>
By the system and method described above, individual components of the<br>
modulated signal package can be used to selectively target different nerves,<br>
different nerve branches, or selected other body parts. That is, a single patch<br>
could provide stimulation signals designed to relieve multiple different symptoms<br><br>
such as those associated with overactive bladder, fecal incontinence, interstitial<br>
cystitis and any other pelvic floor disorder.<br>
Although one specific embodiment has been described thus far, those<br>
skilled in the art will recognize that the appropriate signals may be manipulated in<br>
many different ways to achieve suitable modulated signals and/or signal<br>
packages. For example, a fourth waveform generator 109 may also be included<br>
that generates a fourth carrier waveform 214 having a frequency different from the<br>
second carrier waveform. This may be desirable if stimulation of the first and<br>
second nerve or body part will require the signal(s) to pass through different types<br>
or amounts of tissue. As illustrated, using a single amplitude modulator 108 the<br>
fourth carrier waveform 214 must be applied only during periods of inactivity of the<br>
first waveform to avoid affecting what would be modulated signal 206. In the<br>
alternative, as shown in Fig. 1a, the first waveform 202 and second carrier wave<br>
204 may be provided to a first amplitude modulator 108a to result in a first<br>
modulated waveform as shown as 206 in Fig. 2b. Similarly, the third waveform<br>
210 and fourth carrier waveform 214 may be provided to a second amplitude<br>
modulator 108b to result in a second modulated waveform 216 as shown in Fig.<br>
2b. These first and second modulated waveforms may be further modulated by a<br>
third modulator 108c to create a signal package (i.e., 210) that can be<br>
transdermally applied by electrode 110. First and second modulated signals, of<br>
course, could also be applied separately via first and second electrodes.<br>
As can be seen from signal package 212, there are still periods of the<br>
waveform that are not active. Additional signals can be inserted into these periods<br>
to target other frequency independent pudendal nerves or other body parts.<br>
Referring now back to Fig. 11, the transdermal stimulation devices<br>
described herein may be incorporated into a transdermal patch 101. This patch<br>
may include a first layer 1110 having any suitable adhesive on its underside, with<br>
the active and return electrodes 1112,1114 being secured to the top side 1111 of<br>
the first layer. The adhesive layer may further include holes therein (not shown) to<br>
accommodate the shape of the electrodes and allow direct contact of the<br>
electrodes with the surface of the patient's skin. The electrodes may be secured<br><br>
directly to the first layer, or may be held in place by a second layer 1116<br>
comprised of any suitable material such as a plastic. A third layer 1118 consists<br>
of a flexible electronics board or flex board that contains all of the electronic<br>
elements described above and that is electrically coupled to the electrodes. A<br>
fourth layer 1120 is a thin film battery of any suitable size and shape, and the fifth<br>
layer 1122 is any suitable covering such as the plastic coverings commonly used<br>
in bandages.<br>
Although capable of being applied transdermally only, the conductance of<br>
the stimulation energy from the surface electrode to the target nerve can be<br>
increased by the placement of a conductive pathway or "tract" that may extend<br>
either fully or partially from the surface electrode to the target nerve as illustrated<br>
by Figs. 12a-12c. The conductive tract may be a cross-linked polyacrylamide gel<br>
such as the Aquamid® injectable gel from Contura of Denmark. This bio-inert gel,<br>
injected or otherwise inserted, is highly conductive and may or may not be an<br>
aqueous solution. The implanted gel provides benefits over rigid implants like wire<br>
or steel electrodes. Some of those advantages include ease of delivery, a less<br>
invasive nature, and increased patient comfort as the gel is not rigid and can<br>
conform to the patient's body. As stated above, the injected gel tract is a highly<br>
conductive path from the surface electrode to the target nerve that will further<br>
reduce energy dispersion and increase the efficiency of the energy transfer<br>
between the surface electrode and the target nerve. The conductive ge! pathway<br>
may provide a conductive pathway from an electrode positioned exterior of the<br>
body (i.e., on the skin) or an electrode positioned under the surface of the skin,<br>
both of which are considered to be "in proximity" to the skin.<br>
Fig. 12a illustrates an instance where the conductive gel tract 1201 extends<br>
from the transdermal stimulation device positioned on the skin 1200 of a patient to<br>
a location closer to the targeted nerve 1202 or nerve bundle. Another advantage<br>
of using such a gel material, however, is that unlike rigid conductors (wire), the gel<br>
can be pushed into foramina and other recessed areas. Wire or needle<br>
electrodes can only come in proximity to one plane of the target nerve, whereas<br>
the deformable and flowable gel material can envelope the target nerve as shown<br><br>
in Fig. 12b. That is, the gel tract can be in electrical and physical contact with the<br>
full 360 degrees of the target nerve, thereby eliminating conventional electrode<br>
alignment issues. Although described above as extending substantially from the<br>
transdermal stimulation device to a position closer to the target nerve, the<br>
conductive gel tract could also extend from a location substantially in contact with<br>
the target nerve, to a location closer to (but not substantially in contact with) the<br>
transdermal stimulation device. This type of configuration is illustrated in Fig. 12c.<br>
Multiple gel pockets or tracts in any configuration could be used.<br>
Although one suitable conductive gel has been described above, various<br>
others are also suitable. Many thermoset hydrogels and thermoplastic hydrogels<br>
could be used as well. Examples of thermoset hydrogels include cross-linked<br>
varieties of polyHEMA and copolymers, N-substituted acrylamides,<br>
polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), poly(glyceryl methacrylate), polyethylene oxide),<br>
polyvinyl alcohol), poly(acrylic acid), poly(methacrylic acid), poly(N, N-<br>
dimethylaminopropyl-N'-acrylamide), and combinations thereof with hydrophilic<br>
and hydrophobic comonomers, cross-linkers and other modifiers. Examples of<br>
thermoplastic hydrogels include acrylic derivatives such as HYPAN, vinyl alcohol<br>
derivatives, hydrophilic polyurethanes (HPU) and Styrene/PVP block copolymers.<br>
The above-described signal transmission devices may also be used in a<br>
system that incorporates various biofeedback mechanisms to both create a<br>
closed-loop system for treating urge incontinence, but also to provide a system<br>
wherein pudendal nerve stimulation is selective, and applied only when necessary<br>
as opposed to constantly as has been the case with known attempts at pudendal<br>
nerve stimulation. Such a system further includes one or more sensor devices<br>
115 that are preferably implanted within the body. The sensor devices preferably<br>
include at least one sensor 120 (Fig. 3) that will sense a selected bio-physiological<br>
property, and a data transmission device 122 that transmits data or information<br>
gathered by the sensor back outside the body to be further processed as<br>
described more fully below.<br>
Referring now to Fig. 3, signal transmitter 100 is part of a larger signal<br>
control device 300 that further includes a receiving device 310 such as a<br><br>
MAX1472 from Maxim Semiconductors of Sunnyvale, CA, that is electrically<br>
coupled to and powered by the battery 102. The receiving device receives data<br>
from the one or more sensors 115 and provides this data to a microcontroller 312<br>
or the like. The microcontroller is programmed to receive and analyze the data,<br>
and based on this data to provide input to the first and second waveform<br>
generators 104,106 to thereby control signal transmission by the signal<br>
transmitter 100. For example, the biofeedback sensor 115 may be a pressure<br>
sensor that is implanted within the bladder as described in detail below. As<br>
pressure measured within the bladder over time is indicative of the existence and<br>
magnitude of bladder contractions, when such measurements indicate spastic<br>
bladder muscle activity (as compared to normal bladder contractions which will<br>
result in a slow and steady rise of pressure within the bladder), a feedback signal<br>
can be transmitted to the receiving device and subsequently to the<br>
microcontroller. Based on receipt of this signal, the microcontroller will, via control<br>
of the waveform generators, cause the electrode to transmit the modulated signal.<br>
Receipt of the signal by the pudendal nerve will innervate the bladder muscles to<br>
substantially eliminate the spastic muscle contractions.<br>
Referring now to Figs. 4, 5a and 5b, exemplary biofeedback devices 115<br>
will now be described in greater detail. In a preferred embodiment, the<br>
implantable biofeedback device 115 consists of multiple electronic components<br>
including a power source 402, one or more sensor components 404, and an<br>
electronic interface 406, each of which are electrically coupled to one another and<br>
mechanically mounted on a printed circuit board 407 in a manner well known in<br>
the art. The one or more sensor components 404 sense predetermined<br>
physiological properties within the body, and transmit signals or data representing<br>
such properties to the electrical interface 406. The system may include a data<br>
storage element for storing data correlating to the sensed physiological properties,<br>
but may also include a transmitter 409 for transmitting the data external of the<br>
patient's body so that it can be used to control generation of the modulated signal<br>
as described above. As shown in both Figs. 5a and 5b, in one embodiment the<br><br>
biofeedback device 115 is substantially surrounded by a collapsible housing 510<br>
or cage.<br>
Preferably, the biofeedback system (exclusive of the housing) has an<br>
overall size of about 0.65-10mm in diameter d, and about 0.65-10mm in length 1.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the sensor component is a micro-miniature piezo-<br>
resistive pressure transducer for measuring pressure within a patient's bladder. A<br>
suitable transducer is an MPX series pressure sensor from Motorola of<br>
Schaumburg, III. Other suitable components may include the MSP430F149<br>
microcontroller from Texas Instruments, Inc. of Dallas, TX that can be used to<br>
acquire, filter and store data from the pressure sensor, and power source such as<br>
any suitable biocompatible lithium battery. Although particular suitable electronic<br>
components have been named above, many others also exist and could be<br>
incorporated into the present invention. As indicated, the electronic components<br>
are preferably mounted on printed circuit board. Subsequently, the components<br>
and circuit board can be covered or encapsulated in silicone or other suitable<br>
covering to protect them from the environment, such as the fluid environment in<br>
the bladder<br>
Referring now again to the housing 510 as illustrated in greater detail in<br>
Figs. 5a and 5b, in a preferred embodiment the housing is a collapsible cage<br>
made of a suitable metal such as Nitonol, stainless steel, or a titanium alloy, or a<br>
suitable biocompatible polymer such as polypropylene or polyethylene<br>
terapthalate. The collapsible cage is advantageous in that it can exist in a<br>
collapsed state shown in Fig. 5a that is sufficiently small to allow insertion through<br>
the patient's urethra. Once inserted into the bladder as will be described further<br>
below, however, the cage can assume the expanded state shown in Fig. 5b,<br>
which has a size sufficiently large so that it cannot pass back into the urethra, and<br>
thus will remain in the bladder until physical removal is desired. The housing or<br>
cage returns to its expanded state (Fig. 5b) when not compressed by an external<br>
force. The electrical components and printed circuit board can be mechanically<br>
affixed to the cage in any suitable manner, such as by using a biocompatible<br>
adhesive. The housing may further include a tail element 512 extending<br><br>
outwardly therefrom. This tail element 512 may operate as the transmitter for the<br>
device in place of the transmitter configuration shown in Fig. 4. As will be further<br>
described below, this tail element 512 may also incorporate additional sensor<br>
elements if desired.<br>
In another embodiment, the expandable cage may be made of an<br>
absorbable material such as Ethisorb® (an absorbable synthetic composite made<br>
from polyglactin and polydioxanon) from Ethicon, Inc. of Somerville, N.J., or a<br>
combination of absorbable and non-absorbable materials. The absorbable<br>
material would preferably dissolve after a predetermined period of time, such as at<br>
least 2-3 days, so that the implantable device could be used for temporary data<br>
acquisition and subsequently expelled from the body in a non-invasive manner<br>
after sufficient data has been gathered.<br>
As an alternative to the collapsible cage described above, the housing<br>
could have a stable structure rather than a collapsible structure that itself has an<br>
outer diameter D that is smaller than the diameter of the urethra to allow insertion<br>
therethrough into the bladder (see Fig. 6). The housing may further have one or<br>
more projections 602, such as screw threads, barbs or the like, extending<br>
outwardly therefrom that can be attached to the sidewall of the bladder by being<br>
pushed or driven therein. In yet other alternate embodiments, the implantable<br>
device could be sutured to the bladder wall, or adhered thereto using a suitable<br>
biocompatible adhesive.<br>
In order to implant the device 115, the housing 510 is compressed and<br>
loaded into a single or multi-lumen catheter 700 as shown in Fig. 7a, which is<br>
inserted through the urethra 702 until the tip or distal end 703 is positioned within<br>
the bladder 704. The catheter may be any catheter suitable for intra-urethral<br>
applications, such as a Foley catheter. Fluoroscopy, ultrasound or other similar<br>
technology known to those skilled in the art may be used to aid in delivery and<br>
placement of the implantable system within the bladder. If a multi-lumen catheter<br>
is used, other lumens may be used to fill or drain the bladder, deliver drugs,<br>
provide an access for visualization, or monitor pressure while placing the<br>
implantable system. An expulsion element 706, such as a push rod or the like is<br><br>
inserted into the primary lumen behind the device and housing, and once the<br>
distal end of the catheter is properly positioned within the bladder, the expulsion<br>
element is moved toward the distal end of the catheter in the direction of the arrow<br>
as shown in Figs. 7b and 7c to thereby expel the device and housing from the<br>
distal end of the catheter and into the bladder. As the implantable system exits<br>
the catheter, the collapsible cage 510 is no longer being held in its collapsed<br>
state, and proceeds to expand to its fully expanded state. Although use of a<br>
catheter is described, other suitable implantation methods may also be used, such<br>
as placement via the working channel in a cystoscope or similar surgical tool, or<br>
placement via laparoscopic or open surgical methods. Once deployed within the<br>
bladder, the expandable cage is dimensioned to prevent the device from being<br>
lodged in the bladder neck or otherwise passing into the urethra, but further allows<br>
urine to freely flow through it. Fig. 8 illustrates the device fully deployed within the<br>
bladder 704.<br>
As mentioned above, alternate embodiments that do not employ<br>
expandable cages may also be suitable, such as that shown in Fig. 6. The<br>
method of implantation of such devices would be similar to that described above,<br>
with the expulsion element within the catheter being used to drive the projecting<br>
element 602 into the wall of the bladder to thereby anchor the device to the<br>
bladder.<br>
For purposes of the present invention, the device 115 would preferably<br>
remain within the bladder for an extended period of time to provide constant<br>
feedback used to control operation of the electrode. Where constant feedback is<br>
not used (i.e., Fig. 1), the implantable sensors described herein may nevertheless<br>
be used to obtain data useful in rendering an accurate diagnosis and/or<br>
appropriate treatment. For example, the device could remain within the bladder<br>
for 1-2 days, with bladder pressure measurements being taken every 14 second.<br>
The type and frequency of bladder pressure changes can be subsequently<br>
analyzed to provide feedback to assess urinary function. For example, vesicle<br>
pressure measured over time can reveal voiding times and frequency, can provide<br>
an indication of an overactive bladder, or of bladder overfilling. In one<br><br>
embodiment, the sensor element(s) are designed to operate in an extended sleep<br>
mode, "waking up" at fixed intervals of time to measure pressure or the like. Once<br>
sufficient data has been gathered, the device can subsequently be removed from<br>
the bladder by inserting a catheter into the bladder to retrieve the implantable<br>
device, or using the operating channel of a cystoscope or other suitable<br>
instrument to retrieve the device. The catheter or cystoscope would be inserted<br>
into the bladder, and the device grasped and pulled back into the catheter or<br>
cystoscope channel and subsequently removed from the body.<br>
Under these circumstances, the biofeedback device may further<br>
incorporate a data storage device 408 (Fig. 4) in addition to or in place of the<br>
transmitter for storing rather than transmitting the data. The data can be<br>
subsequently retrieved and manipulated, preferably by uploading the data to a PC<br>
based software application in any suitable manner, such as wirelessly, for<br>
example, via an infrared data acquisition unit such as ENDEC HSDL-7001 and an<br>
IrDA transceiver HSDL-3202 interfaced to the microprocessor, via radiofrequency<br>
acquisition, or via a hard wire connection such as through an RS232 interface.<br>
Referring again to Fig. 3, where biofeedback data is utilized, receiver 310<br>
may receive feedback data from more than one biofeedback device 115. In one<br>
embodiment shown in Fig. 9, a second implantable sensor device 902 similar to<br>
that shown and described in conjunction with Fig. 4 is designed for insertion into<br>
the vaginal canal of a patient, and thus is preferably encapsulated in a "tampon-<br>
like" device or casing as shown. This casing 912 is preferably simply rolled up or<br>
bound cotton, similar to a tampon. With the second implantable device sensing<br>
abdominal pressure, and the first implantable device sensing bladder pressure,<br>
the detrusor pressure (pressure of the muscle lining of the wall of the bladder<br>
tissue) can be determined by subtracting the bladder pressure from the abdominal<br>
pressure. Rises in detrusor pressure will occur if the patient strains, coughs,<br>
sneezes, laughs, etc., and detection of these pressures are clinically significant in<br>
the diagnosis of various bladder and lower urinary tract disease states. For<br>
example, the frequency of detrusor pressure increases provides meaningful data<br>
for assessing urge incontinence.<br><br>
In an alternate embodiment, one of the two implantable devices transmits<br>
data to the other, which then wirelessly transmits both sets of data to receiver<br>
310.<br>
In yet another embodiment, the first implantable device within the bladder<br>
further includes one or more additional sensors 950 that are incorporated into one<br>
or more tail elements, as shown in Figs. 10 and 10a. In one particular<br>
implementation, the sensor(s) are leak detection sensors incorporated into a tail<br>
that is designed to extend from the device within the bladder, through the<br>
sphincter and into the urethral canal 702 as shown in Fig. 8. This sensor(s) detect<br>
the presence of fluid, and thus will detect leakage of urine such as occurs in a<br>
stress incontinent patient, while at the same time the pressure sensor within the<br>
bladder measures bladder pressure. Thus, stress incontinence episodes can be<br>
recorded by correlating time at which a rise in bladder pressure occurs<br>
concurrently with detection of fluid leakage through the urethra.<br>
Further, multiple tail elements 950a, 950b, 950c may incorporate multiple<br>
sensor elements 952a, 952b, 952c as shown in Fig. 10a to record the pressure at<br>
different points in the bladder, and thus provide more accurate readings.<br>
It will be apparent from the foregoing that, while particular forms of the<br>
invention have been illustrated and described, various modifications can be made<br>
without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. Accordingly, it is not<br>
intended that the invention be limited, except as by the appended claims.<br><br>
