				<td>Herbicidal 6-phenoxypyrid-2-ylcarboxamides such as those dis¬closed U.S. Patent 5,294,597 display excellent herbicidal perfor¬mance, in particular against broad-leaved weeds in crops such as cereal crops. However, when used as the sole active ingredient, the 6-phenoxypyrid-2-ylcarboxamides do not always achieve effec¬tive control of the full spectrum of weed species encountered in commercial agronomic applications, in conjunction with reliable selectivity for the crop species. Such gaps in the spectrum of control can be overcome by co-treatment with another herbicide known to be effective against the relevant weed species. The com¬bined use of these 6-phenoxypyrid-2-ylcarboxamides with special further and other herbicides has been described in U.S. Patent 5,674,807.<br>
Therefore it is an object of this invention to provide further herbicidal combinations which exhibit a good herbicidal action exceeding the activity of one active ingredient alone, in par¬ticular in cereal crops.<br>
It is another object of this invention to provide methodes for controlling undesired vegatation, in particular dicotyledonous weeds, using the herbicidal combinations. It is a further object of this invention to provide the method of use of the herbicidal combinations for controlling undesired vegetation, in particular in cereal crops, and in particular against dicotyledonous weeds.<br>
We have found that this object is achieved by herbicidal composi¬tions which comprise an agriculturally acceptable carrier and a herbicidally effective amount of a combination of at least one 6-phenoxypyrid-2-ylcarboxamide of formula I<br><br><br>
R2  represents a hydrogen or halogen atom or an alkyl or alkoxy group;<br>
R2  represents a hydrogen atom or an alkyl group;<br>
X   each independently represents a halogen atom or an optionally substituted alkyl or alkoxy group or an alkenyloxy, cyano, carboxy, alkoxycarbonyl, (alkylthio)carbohyl, alkylcarbonyl,  amido, alkylamido, dialkylamido, nitro, alkylthio, haloalkyl-thio, alkenylthio, alkynylthio, alkylsulphinyl, alkylsulpho-nyl, alkyloximinoalkyl or alkenyloximinoalkyl group;<br>
m  represents 0 or an integer from 1 to 5;<br>
Y  each independently represents a halogen atom or an alkyl, nitro, cyano, haloalkyl, alkoxy or haloalkoxy group;<br>
n  represents 0 or an integer from 1 to 5, and<br>
at least one additional herbicidal compound selected from the group consisting of flufenacet, cinidon-ethyl and carfentrazone-ethyl.<br>
The present invention also provides a method for controlling undesirable plant species comprising application of said composi¬tions.  In the method of this invention, these compounds may be applied separately or together, in herbicidally effective amounts, and in the presence of a crop, preferably a cereal crop, such as wheat.<br>
Although 6-phenoxypyrid-2-ylcarboxamides such as those disclosed in U.S. Patent 5,294,597 display excellent herbicidal perfor¬mance, when used as the sole active ingredient, they do not al¬ways achieve effective control of the full spectrum of weed species encountered in commercial agronomic applications, in con¬junction with reliable selectivity for the crop species.<br>
It has now been found that combinations comprising a 5-phenoxypy-rid-2-ylcarboxamide of formula I<br><br><br>
with at least one additional herbicidal compound selected from the group of flufenacet, cinidon-ethyl or carfentrazone-ethyl provide synergistic control of troublesome broad-leaved weeds and annual grasses, especially such as Setaria  viridis,   Alopecurus myosuroides,   Poa annua,   Stellaria media,   Lamium purpureum,   Galium aparine,   Veronica hederaefolia,   Papaver rhoeas  and Matricaria  in-odora.  That is, application of the combination of the invention gives a mutual reinforcing action such that the application rates of the individual herbicidal component can be reduced and still the same herbicidal effect is achieved or, alternatively, the application of the combination of herbicidal components demon¬strates a greater herbicidal effect than expected from the effect of the application of the individual herbicidal components when applied singly at the rate at which they are present in the com¬bination (synergistic effect).<br>
In the specification and claims, alkyl groups, unless otherwise specified, may be linear or branched and may contain up to 12, preferably 1 to 4, carbon atoms. The alkenyl or alkynyl portion of an alkynyloxy, alkenylthio or alkynylthio group, unless other¬wise specified, may be linear or branched and may contain up to 12, preferably 2 to 4, carbon atoms. Examples of such groups are methyl, ethyl, propyl, vinyl, allyl, isopropyl, butyl, isobutyl and tertiary-butyl groups. The alkyl portion of a haloalkyl, haloalkoxy, alkylthio, haloalkylthio, alkoxy, alkoxycarbonyl, (alkylthio)carbonyl, alkylamido, dialkylamido, alkylsulfinyl or alkylsulfonyl group suitably has from 1 to 4 carbon atoms, pre¬ferably 1 or 2 carbon atoms. The number of carbon atoms in the alkyloximinoalkyl or alkenyloximinoalkyl groups is up to 6, pre¬ferably up to 4, e.g. 2-methoxirainoethyl, 2-methoximinoproyl or 2-ethoximinopropyl.<br>
"Halogen" means a fluorine, chlorine, bromine or iodine atom, preferably fluorine, chlorine or bromine. Haloalkyl, haloalkyl¬thio and haloalkoxy are preferably mono-, di- or trifluoroalkyl.<br><br>
-alkyithio and -alkoxy, especially trifluoromethyl, difluoromethoxy, trifluoromethyithia and trifluoromethoxy.<br>
When any groups are designated as being optionally substituted, the substituent groups which are optionally present may be any of those customarily employed in the modification and/or development of pesticidal compounds and are especially substituents that maintain or enhance the herbicidal activity associated with the compounds of the present invention, or influence persistence of action, soil or plant penetration, or any other desirable property of such herbicidal compounds. There may be one or more of the same or different substituents present in each part of the molecules. In relation to moieties defined above as comprising optionally substituted alkyl- and alkoxy groups, specific examples of such substituents include phenyl, halogen atoms, nitro, cyano, hydroxyl, C|.4-alkoxy, CM-haloalkoxy and C-4-alkoxycarbonyl groups.<br>

A further preferred embodiment of the present invention provides a herbicidal composition which comprises an agriculturally accep¬table carrier and a herbicidally effective amount of a combina¬tion of picolinafen and carfentrazone-ethyl.<br>
Flufenacet is the proposed common name of N-(4-fluorophe-<br>
nyl) -N- (1-methylethyl) -2-{ [5- {trif luoromethyl) -1, 3, 4-thiadiazol-<br>
2-yl]oxy}acetamide, which is disclosed for example in U.S. Patent<br>
5,090,991.<br>
Cinidon-ethyl is the common name of ethyl (Z)-2-chloro-3-[2-chloro-5-(1,3-dioxo-4,5,6,7-tetrahydroisoindoI-2-yl)-phenyl]-acrylate, which is disclosed for example by K. Grossmann, H. Schiffer, Pestic. Sci. (1999), 55(7), 687-695. CODEN: PSSCBG ISSN: 0031-613X.<br><br>
Carfentrazone-echyl is the common name of ethyl (RS)-2-chloro-3-[2-chloro-5-(4-difluoromethyl-4,5-dihydro-3-methyl-5-oxo-lH-1,2,4-triazol-l-yl)-4-fluorophenyl]propionate, which is reported by W. A. Van Saun et al, Proc Br, Crop. Prot. Conf., Weeds, 1993, 1, 19.<br>
The pattern of persistence of the compounds of formula I is such that the combined treatment according to the present invention can be attained either by the application of a prepared mixture as defined above, or by time separated application of separate formulations. Kence, in another preferred embodiment, the present invention provides a method for controlling the growth of weeds at a crop locus which comprises applying to the locus a compound of formula I as defined above and a second component selected from the group consisting of flufenacet, cinidon-ethyl and car-fentrazone-ethyl and mixtures thereof.<br>
The treatment according to the invention may be used to control a broad spectrum of weed species in crops, particularly cereal crops such as in wheat, barley, rice and maize, by pre- or post-emergence treatment, including both early and late post-emerg¬ence. The combined use described above offers both foliar and re¬sidual activity.<br>
By the term "pre-emergence application" is meant application to the soil in which the weed seeds or seedlings are present before emergence of the weeds above the surface of the soil. 3y the term "post-emergence application" is meant application to the aerial or exposed portions of the weeds which have emerged above the surface of the soil. It will be appreciated that application ac¬cording to the method may be from pre- to post-weed emergence, and from pre-crop emergence to post-crop emergence. If one of the active ingredients or the composition of the active ingredients is less well tolerated by certain crop plants, application tech¬niques may be employed in which the herbicidial composition is sprayed, with the aid of the spraying equipment, in such a way that the leaves of the sensitive crop plants come into as little contact as possible, if any, with ten active ingredient(s), while the latter reach the Heaves of undesired plants which grow un¬derneath, or the naked surface (post directed, lay-by). By the term "foliar activity" is meant herbicidal activity obtained by application to the aerial or exposed portions of the weeds which have emerged above the surface of the soil. By the term "residual activity" is meant herbicidal activity obtained some time after application to the soil whereby seedlings present at the time of<br><br>
application or which germinate subsequent to application are controlled.<br>
Weeds that may be controlled by the practice of the present in¬vention include:<br><br><br><br><br>
The necessary application rate of active ingredient composition without formulation auxiliaries, depends on the composition of the plant stand, on the development stage of the plants, on the climatic conditions at the site of action, and on the application technique. In general, the application rate of the active inge-dients together is from 0.001 to 10 kg a.I./ha; preferably from 0.001 to 3 kg ha, in particular 0.01 to 1 kg/ha. In another em¬bodiment of the invention the application rate of the active in¬gredients together is from 0.01 to 10 kg a.i./ha.<br>
The application rate of the compound of formula I is usually in the range of 5 to 500, preferably 7.5-200 grams of active in¬gredient (g a.i.) per hectare, with rates between 10-100 g a.i./ ha often achieving satisfactory control and selectivity. The optimal rate for a specific application will depend on the crop(s) under cultivation and the predominant species of infest-<br><br>
ing weed, and readily may be determined by established biological tests known to those skilled in the art.<br>
The selection of the herbicidally active second component will likewise be dependent on the crop/weed situation to be treated, and will be readily indentifiable by those skilled in this area. The application rate for this second component is determined primarily by the chemical type of the component, since the intrinsic activity of different types of herbicide varies widely. In general, the preferred application rate for flufenacet is in the range of 7.5-400, preferably 10-200 g a.i./ha; the preferred application rate for cinidon-ethyl is in the range of 10-500, preferably 15-250 g/ha; the preferred application rate for car fentrazone-ethyl is in the range of 1-150, preferably 2.5-75 g/ha. The optimal rate for the second component will, however,depend on the crop (s) under cultivation and the level of weed infestation and can readily be determined by established biological tests. Naturally, with such a wide variation in application rate for the second component, the ratio of a formula I compound to a second component in the present invention will be determined predominantly by the choice of the second component. In general the compound of formula I and the second herbicide are employed in such weight ratios that the synergistic effect is observed. The ratio (by weight) of compound of formula I to the second herbicidal compound is as a rule, from 1000:1 to 1:100, preferably from 100:1 to 1:20, in particular from 10:1 to 1:10.<br>
In a preferred embodiment.   The ratio (by weight) of compound of formula I to the second herebidical compound is as a rule, from 100:1 to 1: 100, preferably from 20:1 to 1: 20, in particular from 10:1 to 1: 10. The preferred formula I to second component ratio may vary, e. g., from about 5:1 to about 1:5.<br>
In another preferred embodiment the ratio (by weight) of compound of formula I to the second herbicidal compound is as a rule from 1000:1 to 1:10, preferably from 100:1 to 1:5, in particular from 10:1 to 1:3.3.<br><br>
In another preferred embodiment the ratio (by weight) of the 6-phenoxypyrid-zylcarboxamide of formula I to said additional herbicidal compound is from 1000: 1 to 1 200.<br>
In another preferred embodiment the ratio (by weight) of the 6-phenoxypyrid-2-ylcarboxamide of formula I to said additional herbicidal compound is from 10: I to 1: 200.<br>
In another preferred embodiment the ratio (by weight) of the 6-phenoxypyrid-2-ylcarboxamide of formula I to said additional herbicidel compound is from 1:1 to 1: 80.<br>
Preferably the compound of formula I is picolinafen and the second compound is cinidon-ethyl.<br>
The active compounds can be used in the form of a mixture of separate formulations, typically<br>
mixed with water prior to application (tank-mixtures), or as separate formulations applications<br>
individually within a certain time interval. Both active compounds can also be formulated<br>
together in a suitable ratio ac	<br><br>
cording to the present invention, together with usual carriers and/or additives known in the art.<br>
Accordingly, the invention further provides a herbicidal composi-.ion which comprises as active ingredient, a herbicidally effec-,ive amount of at least one compound of formula I as defined .bove, and at least one compound selected from group consisting if flufenacet, cinidon-ethyl, carfentrazone-ethyl and one or more carriers. Another embodiment of the invention provides a herbiC1-al composition which comprises as active ingredient a herbiC1-ally affective amount of at least one compound of formula I as efined above, and at least one compound selected from the group consisting of flufenacet, cinidon-ethyl and carfentrazone-ethyl, tne or more carriers and at least one surfactant. A method of taking such a composition is also provided which comprises bring-ng the mixture of the compound of formula I and the second com-conent into association with the carrier(s) and if desired with he surfactant(s).<br>
. composition according to the invention generally comprise ap-roximately from 0.001% to 98% by weight(w/w) of active ingredi-nts, preferably contains from 0.01% to 95% by weight (w/w), in articular from 0.5% to 9 5% by weight (w/w) . The active ingredi-nts are employed in a purity of 80% to 100%, preferably 90% to 00%, in particular 95% to 100% (according to NMR-Spectrum).<br>
. carrier in a composition according to the invention is any ma-erial with which the active ingredient is formulated to facili-ate application to the locus to be treated, which may for xample be a plant, seed or soil, or to facilitate storage, ransport or handling. A carrier may be a solid or a liquid, in-luding material which is normally a gas but which has been com-ressed to form a liquid.<br>
he compositions may be manufactured into e.g. emulsion concen-rates, solutions, oil in water emulsions, wettable powders, sol-ble powders, suspension concentrates, dusts, granules, water ispersible granules, micro-capsules, gels and other formulation ypes by well-established procedures. These procedures include ntensive mixing and/or milling of the active ingredients with ther substances, such as fillers, solvents (liquid carriers), olid carriers, surface active compounds (surfactants), and op-ionally solid and/or liquid auxiliaries and/or adjuvants such as etters, adhensives, dispersants or emulsifiers.<br><br>
Granules, for example coated granules, impregnated granules and homogeneous granules, can be prepared by binding the active in¬gredients (s) and if desired other substances, such as surface active compounds, liquid auxiliaries and/or adjuvants, to the solid carrier.<br>
Suitable liquid carriers (solvents) are essencially: mineral oil fractions of medium to high boiling point such as kerosine and diesel oil, furthermore coal tar oils and oils of vegetable or animal origin,- aliphatic, cyclic and aromatic hydrocarbons, for example cyclohexane, parafins, tetrahydronaphthalene, alkylated naphthalenes and their derivates, alkylated benzenes and their derivated (such as Solvesso® 200); phthalic acid esters, such as dibutyl or dioctyl phthalate; alcohols ad glycols as well as their ethers and esters, e.g. methanol, ethanol, propanol, butanol, cyclohexanol, ethylene glycol mono- and dimethyl ether; ketones such as cyclohexenone; strongly polar solvents, for examples amines such as N-methyl pyrrolidone, N-octylpyrrolidone and N-cyclohexylpyrrolidone, or lactones such as yutyrolactone; epoxidized plant oil esters such as methylated coconut or soybean oil ester; and water. Mixtures of different liquid carries are ofcen suitable.<br>
Surfactants may be nonionic, anionic, cationic or zwitterionic substances with good dispersing, emulsifying and wetting properties depending on the nature of the com.pound according to general formula I and/or the additional herbicidal compound se¬lected from the group consisting flufenacet, cinidon-ethyl and carfentrazone-ethyl to be formulated. Surfactants may also mean mixtures of individual surfactants.<br>
Solid carries are essentially:<br>
T.ineral earth such as silicas, silica gels, silicates, talc, kao¬lin, montmorillonite, attapulgite, pumice, sepiolite, bentonite, limestone, lime, chalk, bole, loes, clay, dolomite, diatomaceous earth, calcite, calcium sulfate, magnesium sulfate, magnesium sulfate, magnesium, oxide, sand, ground plastics, ferilizers such as ammoniu.m sulfate, ammonium phosphat, ammonium nitrate, ureas, and crushed products of vegetable origin such as cereal .meal, tree bark mieal, wood meal and nutshell meal, cellulose powders, Dr other solid carriers.<br>
Suitable sufactants are the alkali metal salts, alkaline earth p.etal salts and amm.onium salts of aromatic sulfonic acids, for sxampie lignin-, phenol-, naphthalene- and dibutylnaphthalene-sulfonic acid, and of fatty acids, of alkyl- and alkylaryl-sulfo-<br><br>
nates, of alkyl, lauryl ether and tazzy  alcohol sulfates, and salts of sulfated hexa-, hepca- and octadecanols and of fatty al¬cohol glycol ether, and condensates of sulfonated naphthalene and its derivates with formaldehyde, condensates of naphthalene or of naphthalenesulfonic acids with phenol and formaldehyde, polyoxy-ethylene octylphenol ether, ethoxylated isooctyl-, octyl- or nonylphenol, alkylphenyl and tributylphenyl polyglycol ethers, alkylaryl polyether alcohols, isotridecyl alc6hol, fatty alcohol/ ethylene oxide condensates, ethoxylated castor oil, polyoxy-ethylene alkyl ethers or polyoxypropylene alkyl ethers, lauryl alcohol polyglycol ether acetate, sorbitol esters, lignin-sulfite waste liquors or methylcellulose.<br>
Pesticidal compositions are often formulated and transported in a concentrated form which is subsequently diluted by the user be¬fore application. The presence of small amounts of a surfactant facilitate this process of dilution. Thus, preferably a composi¬tion according to the invention comprises if desires at least one surfactant. For example, the composition may contain one or more carriers and at least one surfactant.<br>
The compositions of the invention may for exam.ple be formulated as wettable powders, water dispersible granules, dusts, granules, solutions, emulsifiable concentrates, emulsions, suspension con¬centrates and aerosols. Wettable powders usually contain 5 to 90% w/w of active ingredient and usually contain in addition to solid inert carrier, 3 to 10% w/w of dispersing and wetting agents and, where necessary, 0 to 10% w/w of stabilizer(s) and/or other addi¬tives such as penetrants or stickers. Dusts are usually formu¬lated as a dust concentrate having a similar composition to that of a wettable powder but without a dispersant, and may be diluted in the field with further solid carrier to give a composition usually containing 0.5 to 10% w/w of active ingredient. Water dispersible granules and granules are usually prepared to have a size between 0.15 mm and 2.0 mm and may be manufactured by a var¬iety of techniques. Generally, these types of granules will con¬tain 0.5 to 90% w/w active ingredient and 0 to 20% w/w of addi¬tives such as stabilizer, surfactants, slow release modifiers and binding agents. The so-called "dry flowables" consist of rela¬tively small granules having a relatively high concentration of active ingredient. Emulsifiable concentrates usually contain, in addition to a solvent or a mixture of solvents, 1 to 80% w/v active ingredient, 2 to 20% w/v emulsifiers and 0 to 20% w/v of other additives such as stabilizers, penetrants and corrosion inhibitors. Suspension concentrates are usually milled so as to obtain a stable, non-sedimenting flowable product and usually contain 5 to 75% w/v active ingredient, 0.5 to 15% w/v of dis-<br><br>
parsing agents, 0.1 to 10% w/v of suspending agents such as protective colloids and thixotropic agents, 0 to 10% w/v of other additives such as defoamers, corrosion inhibitors, stabilizers, penetrants and retention enhancers (stickers), and water or an organic liqaid in which the active ingredient is substantially insoluble; certain organic solids or inorganic salts may be pres¬ent dissolved in the formulation to assist in preventing sedimen¬tation and crystalization or as antifreeze agents for water.<br>
The forms of application of the compositions according to the in¬vention depend on the intended purposes; in any case, they should guarantee as fine as possible a distribution of the active in¬gredients. They can be applied, for example, in the form of di¬rectly sprayable aqueous solutions, powders, suspensions, also highly-concentrated aqueous, oily or other suspensions or dispersions, emulsions, oil dispersions, pastes, dusts, materials for spreading or granules, by spraying, atomizing, dusting or pouring.<br>
Aqueous use forms can be prepared from emulsion concentrates, suspensions, pastes, wettable powders or water-dispersible gran¬ules by adding water. To prepare emulsions, pastes or oil dispersions, the herbicidally active ingredients as such or dissolved in an oil or solvent, can be homogenized in water by means of wetters, adhesives, dispersants or emulsifiers.<br>
Alternatively, concentrates which consist of herbicidally active ingredients, wetter, adhesive, dispersant or emulsifier and, if appropriate solvent or oil may be prepared, and such concentrates are suitable for dilution with water.<br>
Aqueous dispersions and emulsions, for example compositions ob¬tained by diluting the formulated product according to the inven¬tion with water, also lie within the scope of the invention.<br>
Of particular interest in enhancing the duration of the protective activity of the compounds of this invention is the use of a carrier which will provide slow release of the pesticidal compounds into the environment of a plant which is to be pro¬tected.<br>
The biological activity of the active ingredient can also be in¬creased by including an adjuvant in the spray dilution. An adjuvant is defined here as a substance which can increase the biological activity of an active ingredient but is not itself significantly biologically active. The adjuvant can either be in¬cluded in the formulation as a coformulant nr carrier, or can be<br><br>
added to the spray tank together with the formulation containing the active ingredient.<br>
As a commodity the compositions may preferably be in a concen¬trated form whereas the end user generally employs diluted com¬positions. The compositions may be diluted co a concentranion down to 0,001% of active ingredient, usually the formulation com¬prise approximately from 0.001 to 98% by weight, preferably 0.01 CO 95% by weight, of active ingredients. The doses usually are in the range from 0.01 to 10 kg a.i./ha.<br><br><br>

The compositions of this invention can also comprise other compounds having biological activity, e.g. compounds having simi¬lar or complementary pesticidal activity or compounds having plant growth regulating, fungicidal, or insecticidal or antibac¬terial activity. These mixtures of pesticides can have a broader spectrum of activity than the synergistic composition according to this invention alone. Also of .interest is the mixability with mineral salt solutions, which are employed for treating nutri¬tional and trace element deficiencies. Nonphytotoxic oils and oil concentrates may also be added.<br>
The following examples illustrate specific embodiments of the present invention; however, the invention is not limited to the embodiments so illustrated, but includes the entire scope of the appended claims.<br>
For a more clear understanding of the invention, specific exam.ples thereof are set forth below.  These examples are merely illustrative, and are not to be understood as limiting the scope and underlying principles of the invention in any way.<br><br>
m the following examples, synergism for two-way combinations is determined by the Colby'- method, i.e. the expected (or predicted) response of the combination is calculated by taking the product of the observed response for each individual component of the combination when applied alone divided by 100 and subtracting this value from the sum of the observed response for each compo¬nent when applied alone.  Synergism of the combination is then determined by comparing the observed response of the combination to the expected (or predicted) response as calculated from the observed responses of each individual component alone.  If the observed response of the combination is greater than the expected (or predicted) response then the combination is said to be synergistic and falls within the definition of synergistic effect as previously defined.<br>
The foregoing is illustrated mathematically below, wherein a two-way combination, C2, is composed of component X plus component Y and Obs. designates the observed response of the combination C2.<br>
Postemergence Herbicidal Greenhouse Evaluations<br>
Test Serie A ■.<br>
Plant seeds are sown in pots containing a loamy sand soil (0.5 1). The herbicides are applied as single treatments, or in a com¬bination comprising a compound of formula I and a second compound as defined above, afcer emergence of weeds and crop. The herbici¬dal performance is assessed as percent damage in comparison to the untreated control plants. The assessment is done 21 days after the treatment. Wheat and barley are treated at the 3-4 leaf stage, the broad-leaf weeds at the 2-4 leaf stage and annual grasses at the 2-3 leaf stage.<br><br><br>
For the compound of formula I picolinafen is employed. The second component has application rates (and hence component ratios) chosen to be appropriate to the established activity level of that component.<br>
The following abbreviations have been used in the tables:<br>
EXP is the expected response by means of the Colby formula.<br>
03S is the observed response.<br>
The damage caused by the chemicals was assessed with reference to a scale from 0 to 100% in comparison with the untreated control plants. 0 means no damage and 100 means compete destruction of the plants.<br>
Table I gives the results of the postemergence herbicidal activ¬ity of piclonafen / flufenacet combinations on various weed species.  As can be seen from the data shown in Table I the  application of a combination of picolinafen plus flufenacet gives significantly greater weed control than that which could be pre¬dicted from the weed control resulting from the application of either picolinafen alone or flufenacet alone.  Crop tolerance (wheat and barley) is excellent for all treatments.<br>
Table II gives the results of the postemergence herbicidal activ¬ity of piclonafen / carfentrazone-ethyl combinations on Stellaria media.  As can be seen from the data shown in Table II che application of a combination of picolinafen plus carfencrazone ethyl gives significantly greater weed control than that which could be predicted from the weed control resulting from the application of either picolinafen alone or carfentrazone-ethyl alone.  Crop tolerance (wheat and barley) is excellent for all treatments.<br><br><br><br>
Table II.   Svaluation of the Postemergence Herbicidal Activity of Picolinafen/Carfentrazone-ethyl Combinations on Sceliaria media<br><br><br><br>
Test Serie B<br>
For che post-emergence treatment, the test plants were first grown to a height of 3 to 20 cm, depending on the growth habit, and only then treated. The herbicides were suspended or emulsi¬fied in water as the vehicle and sprayed with the aid of finely distributing nozzles.<br>
Cinidon-ethyl was formulated as a 20 % by weight emulsion concen¬trate and employed in the spray mixture with addition of that amount of solvent system with which the active ingredient had been applied at the application rates shown in the tables.<br>
Picolinofen was formulated as a 10% by weight emulsion concen¬trate and empolyed in the spray mixture with addition of that amount of solvent system with which the active ingredient had been applied at the rates shown in the tables.<br>
The test period extended over 14 days. During this time, the plants were attended, and their responses to the treatments with active ingredients were recorded (Tables III and IV).<br>
