				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a washing machine wherein at least six different types of stains on the fabrics/clothes, made of cotton are removed by the washing machine without damaging the fabrics/clothes in the most efficient way.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
In the conventional washing machine, no provision to remove these types of stains is there and the stains have to be pre-washed before putting the clothes into the washing machine. The conventional washing machine has soak and continuous wash for a specified duration. Further, in the conventional washing machine, load sensing is done by a rotating impeller. This leads to cloth entanglement and augur breakage.<br>
In the existing washing machines the load is sensed by means of the rotating impeller while in the present washing machine an agitator is provided. The present invention uses a fuzzy logic cycle which is incorporated in the agitator by indexing the basket instead of the agitator. The new fuzzy logic cycle is built to address voltage variations as well. In the conventional washing machine, the fuzzy logic cycle was not used and hence the novelty of the new machine resides in the use of the fuzzy logic cycle.<br>
In the existing cycle, the agitation is created only once after heating is done and then the water is drained off. This results in the removal of dirt only but<br>
not cough stains. So, in the conventional washing machine the cloth/fabric has to be pre-treated manually before the cloth/fabric can be put into the machine.<br>
However, with the fuzzy logic cycle, these detriments in the washing process have been done away with. The pre-treatment of the fabric is no longer necessary and the tough stains are also washed away. In the fuzzy logic cycle, the agitation is a three step process which is enumerated below:-<br>
(a)	the washing machine is filled with the load and agitated for a certain time duration;<br>
(b)	the load is then heated to 45째 Celsius and then again it is agitated; and<br>
(c)	the load is then heated to 60째 Celsius and then again it is agitated and finally drained.<br>
The present washing machine has the following unique features not available in the conventional machine:-<br>
1.	Fuzzy logic cycle :-<br>
The fuzzy logic cycle which operates the automatic detergent dispenser which is connected to the motor which in turn is connected to the Power Direction reversal device. The fuzzy logic cycle is meant to deter the load and consecutively the water level. The fuzzy logic cycle mainly comprises two stages in the wash process:-<br>
(a) cold stage wherein the clothes are agitated without heating and<br>
(b) hot stags wherein the clothes after being agitated once is heated to 45째 and than agitated and then again heated to 60째 Celsius.<br>
This combination of cold and hot wash helps in the removal of both protein and non-protein stains.<br>
2.	Automatic water level selection:-<br>
The desired level of water is automatically selected by the machine after the desired temperature is adjusted.<br>
3.	Wash cycle:-<br>
Wash cycle wherein the duration of the wash cycle is controlled by the fuzzy logic cycle. In the conventional washing machines, the cycle duration was of a longer duration. It took 34 minutes for the whole cycle whereas in the proposed fuzzy logic cycle the time duration has been considerably reduced to 23 minutes.<br>
OBJECTIVES OF THE INVENTION<br>
The objective of the present invention is to remove the stains of six different types which have been enumerated below:-<br>
1.	Coffee,<br>
2.	Tea,<br>
3.	Red sand,<br>
4.	Sauce,<br>
5.	Shoe Polish and<br>
6.	Pickle.<br>
Another objective of the present invention is to measure the amount of din removed from the cloth/fabric.<br>
Yet another objective of the present invention is to remove the stains of the fabric/clothes without damaging the cloth/fabric.<br>
The invention resides in the fuzzy logic cycle connected with the automatic detergent dispense which in turn is connected with the motor which is connected to the Power direction reversal device.<br>
The heating is done at a higher temperature and then it is subjected to agitation. The level of the water is kept at a required level and the agitator has got a predetermined number of veins having a profile specially designed. The voltage frequency and belt tension are all controlled by fuzzy logic cycle. The automatic dispenser is of motor type and comprises of discharge mechanism operating at a certain voltage and frequency. The motor has fixed wattage, stack height, number of poles, speed, torque, initial resistance, voltage and frequency.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS Figs.  1-8 left with the provisional specification may be adopted.<br>
Fig. 1 shows the existing cycle in the conventional washing machines. In the existing cycle the load is first heated to a certain degree and then agitated for a certain duration and then it is drained.<br>
Fig. 2 shows the suggested fuzzy logic cycle wherein the load is first given a pre-wash without agitating at a certain temperature and then drained and then the main wash cycle is shown wherein the heating and agitating is done<br>
alternately twice; once at a temperature of 45째 Celsius and then at a temperature of 60째 Celsius.<br>
Fig. 3 shows the System map in detail. It shows a flow-chart consisting of the fuzzy logic cycle, automatic detergent dispenser and motor. The automatic water selection is controlled by the fuzzy logic cycle, the automatic detergent dispenser controls the required detergent discharge and the motor is connected to the Power Direction reversal device.<br>
The fuzzy logic cycle is of the prime mover type, has a number of vanes, vane profiles and motor torque. The automatic detergent dispenser has a motor type and discharge mechanism and the motor has design parameters of a specific wattage, stack height, number of poles and initial resistance and speed and torque are critical to the motor.<br>
Fig. 4 shows the Process map as a flow-chart. The Key Parameter Input Variables (KPIVs) are water temperature, cloth capacity, prime mover On/Off timing, fabric type, detergent type, wash duration, process sequence, water level and detergent composition controlled by the fuzzy logic cycle. The Stain Removal cycle as hereinbefore described in the earlier pages, is done with the parameters of noise, stain concentration, ambient temperature under control of the fuzzy logic cycle. The water hardness should be from 150-250 ppm and the voltage fluctuation of 170V-240V is taken care of by the fuzzy logic cycle. The Key Parameter Output Variables (KPIVs) of the process are that stains are removed without any damage done to the cloth/fabric.<br>
Fig. 5, 6 and 7 are the flow-charts showing the process map in detail. Initially the soil level is measured in the cloth and then the cloth/ fabric is loaded and then water is filled and given a wash . In this wash, the soil removal is done mechanically and then it is drained, the water drained is monitored. After the<br>
mechanical wash is clone the Sub Interval Spin fS'S) is done then the agitation is done alter the temperature is increased to 45째 Celsius and than the soap water is extracted , the water is then filled to rinse the materia! and then the cloth/fabric is rinsed. The water is then drained and then Sub interval Spin (SIS) is done again and then the temperature is increased to 60째 Celsius and the process is repeated and finally the cloth/fabric is unloaded. The results are that the stains are removed, there is less tangling and less manual intervention is there as compared to the conventional washing machines.<br>
Fig. 8 shows the process map shown in Fig. 5, 6 and 7 in a single figure. The water temperature is initially kept at a constant and then the system is agitated and given a mechanical wash. Then the heating is done to 45째 Celsius and then again agitated and then drained. Then it is again heated till 60째 Celsius and then again agitated and then finally drained and unloaded.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
