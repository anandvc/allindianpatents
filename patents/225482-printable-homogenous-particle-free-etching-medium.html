				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to novel etching media in the form of printable,'<br>
homogeneous, particle-free etching pastes having non-Newtonian flow<br>
behaviour for etching inorganic, glass-like amorphous or crystalline surfaces,<br>
in particular of glasses or ceramics, preferably on SiO2- or silicon nitride-<br>
based systems, and to the use of these etching media.<br>
The term 'inorganic surfaces' is taken to mean oxidic and nitride-containing<br>
compounds of silicon, in particular silicon oxide and silicon nitride surfaces.<br>
Definition of glass:<br>
The term 'glass' is per se taken to mean a uniform material, for example<br>
quartz glass, window glass or borosilicate glass, and also thin layers of these<br>
materials produced on other substrates (for example ceramics, metal<br>
sheeting or silicon wafers) by various processes known to the person skilled<br>
in the art (CVD, PVD, spin-on, thermal oxidation, inter alia).<br>
The term 'glasses' below is taken to mean silicon oxide- and silicon nitride-<br>
containing materials which exist in the solid amorphous state without the<br>
glass components crystallizing out and have a high degree of disorder in the<br>
microstructure owing to the lack of a long-range order.<br>
Besides pure SiO2 glass (quartz glass), all glasses are included (for example<br>
doped glasses, such as borosilicate, phosphosilicate and borophospho-<br>
silicate glasses, coloured, milk and crystal glasses, optical glasses) which<br>
comprise SiO2 and other components, in particular elements such as, for<br>
example, calcium, sodium, aluminium, lead, lithium, magnesium, barium,<br>
potassium, boron, beryllium, phosphorus, gallium, arsenic, antimony,<br>
lanthenum, zinc, thorium, copper, chromium, manganese, iron, cobalt, nickel,<br>
molybdenum, vanadium, titanium, gold, platinum, palladium, silver, cerium,<br>
caesium, niobium, tantalum, zirconium, neodymium and praseodymium,<br>
which occur in the glasses or function as doping elements in the glasses in<br>
the form of oxides, carbonates, nitrates, phosphates, sulfates and/or halides.<br>
Doped glasses are, for example, borosilicate, phosphosilicate and<br>
borophosphosilicate glasses, coloured, milk and crystal glasses and optical<br>
glasses.<br>
The silicon nitride may likewise comprise other elements, such as boron,<br>
aluminium, gallium, indium, phosphorus, arsenic or antimony.<br>
Definition of silicon oxide- and silicon nitride-based systems:<br>
The term 'silicon oxide-based systems' is applied below to all crystalline<br>
systems which do not fall under the definition given above for amorphous<br>
SiO2 glasses and are based on silicon dioxide; these can be, in particular, the<br>
salts and esters of orthosilicic acid and condensation products thereof-<br>
generally referred to as silicates by the person skilled in the art - and quartz<br>
and glass-ceramics.<br>
This definition also covers other silicon oxide- and silicon nitride-based<br>
systems, in particular the salts and esters of orthosilicic acid and<br>
condensation products thereof. Besides pure SiO2 (quartz, tridymite and<br>
cristobalite), the definition covers all SiO2-based systems that are built up<br>
from SiO2 or from 'discrete' and/or linked [SiO4] tetrahedra, such as, for<br>
example, nesosilicates, sorosilicates, cyclosilicates, inosilicates, phyllo-<br>
silicates and tectosilicates, and other components, in particular elements/<br>
components such as, for example, calcium, sodium, aluminium, lithium,<br>
magnesium, barium, potassium, beryllium, scandium, manganese, iron,<br>
titanium, zirconium, zinc, cerium, yttrium, oxygen, hydroxyl groups and<br>
halides.<br>
The term 'silicon nitride-based systems' is applied below to all crystalline and<br>
partially crystalline (usually referred to as microcrystalline) systems which do<br>
not fall under the definition given above for amorphous silicon nitride<br>
glasses/layers. These include Si3N4 in its a-Si3N4,and ß-Si3N4modifications<br>
and all crystalline and partially crystalline SiNx and SiNx:H layers. The<br>
crystalline silicon nitride may be doped by other elements, such as boron,<br>
aluminium, gallium, indium, phosphorus, arsenic and antimony.<br>
1. Etching of structures on glass<br>
The use of etchants, i.e. chemically aggressive compounds, causes<br>
dissolution of the material subjected to the attack by the etchant. It is not only<br>
the first layer of the attack surface but also - seen from the attack surface -<br>
deeper layers that are attacked and removed.<br>
2. Etching of structures on silicon oxide- and silicon nitride-based glasses and<br>
other silicon oxide- and silicon nitride-based systems<br>
According to the current state of the art, any desired structures can be etched<br>
selectively in silicon oxide- and silicon nitride-based glasses and other silicon<br>
oxide- and silicon nitride-based systems or their surfaces or their layers of<br>
variable thickness, directly by laser-supported etching methods or, after<br>
masking, by wet-chemical methods [1,2] or by dry-etching methods [3].<br>
In the laser-supported etching methods, the laser beam scans the entire etch<br>
pattern point for point on the glass, which, in addition to a high degree of<br>
precision, also requires considerable adjustment effort and is very time-<br>
consuming.<br>
The wet-chemical and dry etching methods include material-intensive, time-<br>
consuming and expensive process steps:<br>
A. masking of the areas not to be etched, for example by:<br>
• photolithography: production of a negative or positive of the etch structure<br>
(depending on the resist), coating of the substrate surface (for example by<br>
spin coating with a suitable photoresist), drying of the photoresist,<br>
exposure of the coated substrate surface, development, rinsing, if desired<br>
drying<br>
B. etching of the structures by:<br>
• dip methods (for example wet etching in wet-chemical banks): dipping of<br>
the substrates into the etch bath, etching process, repeated rinsing in H2O<br>
cascade basins, drying<br>
• spin-on or spray methods: the etching solution is applied to a rotating<br>
substrate, the etching operation can take place without/with input of energy<br>
(for example IR or UV irradiation), and this is followed by rinsing and drying<br>
• dry-etching methods, such as, for example, plasma etching in expensive<br>
vacuum units or etching with reactive gases in flow reactors<br>

Microtechnology], Wiley VCH 1998.<br>
3. Full-area etching of silicon oxide- and silicon nitride-based glasses and<br>
other silicon oxide- and silicon nitride-based systems<br>
In order to etch silicon oxide- and silicon nitride-based glasses and other<br>
silicon oxide- and silicon nitride-based systems and their layers of variable<br>
thickness to a certain depth over the entire area, use is predominantly made<br>
of wet-etching methods. The silicon oxide- and silicon nitride-based glasses<br>
and other silicon oxide- and silicon nitride-based systems and their layers of<br>
variable thickness are dipped into etch baths, which usually contain toxic and<br>
highly corrosive hydrofluoric acid or another mineral acid as etching<br>
component.<br>
The disadvantages of the etching methods described are due to the time-<br>
consuming, material-intensive, expensive process steps which are in some<br>
cases complex from a technologically or safety point of view or are carried<br>
out batchwise.<br>
The object of the present invention is therefore to provide an etching medium<br>
which can be employed in a technologically simple etching method with high<br>
potential throughputs for inorganic surfaces, in particular for glass and other<br>
silicon oxide- or silicon nitride-based systems, and their layers of variable<br>
thickness, this simple etching method being significantly less expensive than<br>
conventional wet and dry etching methods in the liquid or gas phase.<br>
The invention thus relates to printable, homogeneous, particle-free etching<br>
pastes which have an advantageous, non-Newtonian flow behaviour, and to<br>
the use thereof for etching inorganic surfaces, in particular surfaces of silicon<br>
oxide- and silicon nitride-based glasses and other silicon oxide- and silicon<br>
nitride-based systems and their layers of variable thickness.<br>
The invention also relates to the use of these homogeneous, particle-free<br>
etching pastes which have non-Newtonian flow behaviour in - compared with<br>
the conventional wet and dry etching methods in the liquid or gas phase -<br>
less expensive, technologically simple printing/etching methods for glass and<br>
for other silicon dioxide- and silicon nitride-based systems which are suitable<br>
for high throughputs and can be carried out continuously.<br>
The production, shaping and aftertreatment, such as, for example, grinding,<br>
polishing, lapping and heat treatment, of the SiO2-based systems are - as in<br>
the case of the glasses - unimportant for the use described in accordance<br>
with the invention of printable, homogeneous, particle-free etching pastes<br>
having non-Newtonian flow behaviour.<br>
The invention relates both to the etching of SiO2- or silicon nitride-coated<br>
substrates as uniform, full, nonporous and porous solids (for example glass<br>
grains and powders, and flat, hollow, mirror or sintered glass), obtained, for<br>
example, from glass melts, and also to the etching of nonporous and porous<br>
glass layers of variable thickness which have been produced on other<br>
substrates (for example on ceramics, metal sheeting or silicon wafers) by<br>
various methods known to the person skilled in the art (for example CVD,<br>
PVD, spin-on of Si-containing precursors, thermal oxidation ...).<br>
The etching pastes are applied in a single process step to the substrate<br>
surface to be etche.d. The surface to be etched can be a surface or part-<br>
surface on a homogeneous, solid, porous or nonporous element made from<br>
silicon oxide- or silicon nitride-based glass or other silicon oxide- or silicon<br>
nitride-based systems (for example the surface of a silicon oxide glass sheet)<br>
and/or a surface or part-surface of a porous or nonporous layer of glass or<br>
other silicon oxide- or silicon-nitride based systems on a support material.<br>
A method with a high degree of automation and high throughput which is<br>
suitable for transfer of the etching paste to the substrate surface to be etched<br>
uses printing technology. In particular, screen printing, silk-screen printing,<br>
pad printing, stamp printing and ink-Jet printing methods are printing methods<br>
which are known to the person skilled in the art. Manual application is<br>
likewise possible.<br>
Depending on the design of the screen, silk screen, klischee or stamp or the<br>
cartridge addressing, it is possible to apply the printable, homogeneous,<br>
particle-free etching pastes having non-Newtonian flow behaviour which are<br>
described in accordance with the invention over the entire area or selectively<br>
in accordance with the etch structure mask only to the points at which etching<br>
is desired. All masking and lithography steps as described under A) are<br>
unnecessary. The etching operation can take place with or without input of<br>
energy, for example in the form of heat radiation (using IR emitters). After<br>
etching is complete, the printable, homogeneous, particle-free etching pastes<br>
having non-Newtonian flow behaviour are rinsed off the etched surface using<br>
a suitable solvent or burnt out.<br>
By variation of the following parameters, the etch depth in silicon oxide- and<br>
silicon nitride-based glasses or other silicon oxide- and silicon nitride-based<br>
systems and their layers of variable thickness, and in the case of selective<br>
structure etching, in addition the edge sharpness of the etch structures can<br>
be adjusted;<br>
• concentration and composition of the etching components<br>
• concentration and composition of the solvents employed<br>
• concentration and composition of the thickener systems<br>
• concentration and composition of any acids added<br>
• concentration and composition of any additives added, such as antifoams,<br>
thixotropic agents, flow-control agents, deaeration agents and adhesion<br>
promoters<br>
• viscosity of the printable, homogeneous, particle-free etching pastes<br>
having non-Newtonian flow behaviour which are described in accordance<br>
with the invention<br>
• etching duration with or without input of energy into the inorganic surfaces<br>
printed with the respective printing paste and their layers, and<br>
• input of energy into the system printed with the etching paste.<br>
The etching duration can be between a few seconds and several minutes,<br>
depending on the application, desired etching depth and/or edge sharpness<br>
of the etch structures. In general, an etching duration of between 1 and 15<br>
minutes is set.<br>
The printable, homogeneous, particle-free etching pastes having non-<br>
Newtonian flow behaviour which are described in accordance with the<br>
invention are - compared with liquid, dissolved or gaseous etchants, such as<br>
inorganic mineral acids from the group consisting of hydrofluoric acid,<br>
fluorides, HF gas and SF6 - advantageously significantly simpler and safer to<br>
handle and are significantly more economical with respect to the amount of<br>
etchant.<br>
The printable, homogeneous, particle-free etching pastes having non-<br>
Newtonian flow behaviour according to the invention have the following<br>
composition:<br>
a. an etching component for glass or for other SiO2-based systems and<br>
layers thereof<br>
b. solvent<br>
c. thickener<br>
d. if desired, organic and/or inorganic acid(s)<br>
e. if desired, additives, such as antifoams, thixotropic agents, flow-control<br>
agents, deaeration agents and adhesion promoters.<br>
The etching action of the printable, homogeneous, particle-free etching<br>
pastes having non-Newtonian flow behaviour which are described in<br>
accordance with the invention on surfaces of silicon oxide- and silicon nitride-<br>
based glasses and other silicon oxide- and silicon nitride-based systems is<br>
based on the use of solutions of fluoride-containing components with or<br>
without addition of acid, in particular solutions of fluorides, bifluorides,<br>
tetrafluoroborates, such as, for example, ammonium, alkali metal and<br>
antimony fluorides, ammonium, alkali metal and calcium bifluorides, alkylated<br>
ammonium and potassium tetrafluoroborates, and mixtures thereof. These<br>
etching components are effective in the etching pastes even at temperatures<br>
in the range from 15 to 50°C, in particular at room temperature, and/or are<br>
activated by input of energy, for example by thermal radiation by IR emitters<br>
(up to about 300°C), UV or laser radiation.<br>
The proportion of the etching components employed is in a concentration<br>
range of from 2 to 20% by weight, preferably in the range from 5 to 15% by<br>
weight, based on the total weight of the etching paste.<br>
The solvent may form the principal constituent of the etching paste. The<br>
proportion can be in the range from 10 to 90% by weight, preferably in the<br>
range from 15 to 85% by weight, based on the total weight of the etching<br>
paste.<br>
Suitable solvents may be inorganic and/or organic solvents, or mixtures<br>
thereof. Suitable solvents, which can be employed in pure form or in<br>
corresponding mixtures, may be, depending on the application:<br>
• water<br>
• simple or polyhydric alcohols, such as, for example, diethylene glycol,<br>
dipropylene glycol, 1,2-propanediol, 1,4-butanediol, 1,3-butanediol,<br>
glycerol, 1,5-pentanediol, 2-ethyl-1-hexanol, or mixtures thereof,<br>
• ketones, such as, for example, acetophenone, methyl-2-hexanone, 2-<br>
octanone, 4-hydroxy-4-methyl-2-pentanone or 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidone<br>
• ethers, such as ethylene glycol monobutyl ether, triethylene glycol<br>
monomethyl ether, diethylene glycol monobutyl ether or dipropylene glycol<br>
monomethyl ether<br>
• carboxylic acid esters, such as [2,2-butoxy(ethoxy)]ethyl acetate<br>
• esters of carbonic acid, such as propylene carbonate<br>
• inorganic mineral acids, such as hydrochloric acid, phosphoric acid,<br>
sulfuric acid or nitric acid, or organic acids which have an alkyl radical<br>
chain length of n = 1 -10, or mixtures thereof. The alkyl radical may be<br>
either straight-chain or branched. In particular, organic carboxylic, hydroxy-<br>
carboxylic and dicarboxylic acids, such as formic acid, acetic acid, lactic<br>
acid, oxalic acid or the like, are suitable.<br>
These solvents or mixtures thereof are, inter alia, also suitable for removing<br>
the etching medium again after etching is complete and, if desired, cleaning<br>
the etched surface.<br>
The viscosity of the printable, homogeneous, particle-free etching pastes<br>
having non-Newtonian flow behaviour which are described in accordance<br>
with the invention is achieved by network-forming thickeners which swell in<br>
the liquid phase and can be varied depending on the desired area of<br>
application. The printable, homogeneous, particle-free etching pastes having<br>
non-Newtonian flow behaviour which are described in accordance with the<br>
invention include all etching pastes whose viscosity is not independent of the<br>
shear rate, in particular etching pastes having a shear-thinning action. The<br>
network produced by thickeners collapses under shear stress. The<br>
restoration of the network can take place without time delay (non-Newtonian<br>
etching pastes having a plastic or pseudoplastic flow behaviour) or with a<br>
time delay (etching pastes having a thixotropic flow behaviour).<br>
The printable, homogeneous, particle-free etching pastes having non-<br>
Newtonian flow behaviour are completely homogeneous with addition of<br>
thickener. Particulate thickeners, such as, for example, particulate silicone or<br>
acrylic resins, are not used.<br>
Possible thickeners are polymers based on the following monomer units:<br>
• glucose units<br>
- ß-glucosidically linked, i.e. cellulose and/or cellulose derivatives, such<br>
as cellulose ethers, in particular ethyl- (for example Aqualon® EC),<br>
hydroxylpropyl- (for example Klucel®) and hydroxyethylcellulose (for<br>
example Natrosol®), and salts of the glycol acid ether of cellulose, in<br>
particular sodium carboxymethylhydroxyethylcellulose (for example Na-<br>
CMHEC)<br>
- a-glucosidically linked, i.e. starch and/or starch derivatives, such as<br>
oxidized starch, in particular sodium carboxymethylstarch (vivastar®<br>
P0100 or vivastar® P5000), and starch ethers, in particular anionic<br>
heteropolysaccharides (Deuteron® VT819 or Deuteron® XG)<br>
• functionalized methacrylate units, in particular cationic<br>
methacrylate/methacrylamide, such as Borchigel® A PK<br>
• functionalized vinyl units, i.e.<br>
- polyvinyl alcohols of various degree of hydrolysis, in particular Mowiol®<br>
47-88 (partially hydrolysed, i.e. vinyl acetate and vinyl alcohol units) or<br>
Mowiol® 56-98 (fully hydrolysed)<br>
- polyvinylpyrolidones (PVP), in particular PVP K-90 or PVP K-120<br>
The thickeners can be employed individually or in combinations with other<br>
thickeners.<br>
The proportion of the thickeners that is necessary for specific setting of the<br>
viscosity range and basically for the formation of a printable paste is in the<br>
range from 0.5 to 25% by weight, preferably from 3 to 20% by weight, based<br>
on the total weight of the etching paste.<br>
As already described, the etching pastes according to the invention are also <br>
completely homogeneous with addition of thickener. They do not comprise<br>
any particulate thickeners, such as, for example, particulate silicone or acrylic<br>
resins.<br>
Organic and inorganic acids whose pKa value is between 0 and 5 may have<br>
been added to the printable, homogeneous, particle-free etching pastes<br>
having non-Newtonian flow behaviour which are described in accordance<br>
with the invention. Inorganic mineral acids, such as, for example, hydrochloric<br>
acid, phosphoric acid, sulfuric acid and nitric acid, and also organic acids<br>
which have an alkyl radical chain length of n = 1 -10 improve the etching<br>
action of the printable, homogeneous, particle-free etching pastes having<br>
non-Newtonian flow behaviour. The alkyl radical of the organic acids may be<br>
either straight-chain or branched, with organic carboxylic, hydroxycarboxylic<br>
and dicarboxylic acids, such as formic acid, acetic acid, lactic acid and oxalic<br>
acid, or others being particularly suitable. The proportion of the acid(s) can be<br>
in the range from 0 to 80% by weight, based on the total weight of the etching<br>
paste.<br>
Additives having properties which are advantageous for the desired purpose<br>
are<br>
antifoams, such as, for example, the one available under the trade name<br>
TEGO® Foamex N,<br>
thixotropic agents, such as BYK® 410, Borchigel® Thixo2,<br>
flow-control agents, such as TEGO® Glide ZG 400,<br>
deaeration agents, such as TEGO® Airex 985, and<br>
adhesion promoters, such as Bayowet® FT 929.<br>
These may have a positive effect on the printability of the printing paste. The<br>
proportion of the additives is in the range from 0 to 5% by weight, based on<br>
the total weight of the etching paste.<br>
Areas of application for the etching pastes according to the invention are<br>
found, for example, in<br>
• the solar cell industry (photovoltaic components, such as solar cells and<br>
photodiodes)<br>
• the semiconductor industry<br>
• the glass industry<br>
• high-performance electronics<br>
The novel printable, homogeneous, particle-free etching pastes having non-<br>
Newtonian behaviour according to the invention can be employed, in<br>
particular, in all cases where full-area and/or structured etching of surfaces of<br>
silicon oxide- and silicon nitride-based glasses and other silicon oxide- and<br>
silicon nitride-based systems and their layers is desired.<br>
Thus, entire surfaces, but also individual structures selectively can be etched<br>
down to the desired depth into uniform, solid, nonporous and porous glasses<br>
and other uniform, solid, nonporous and porous silicon oxide- and silicon<br>
nitride-based systems, i.e. the etching operation can cover all ranges<br>
between microstructural roughening (still transparent glasses with a light-<br>
scattering effect) via frosting/matting effects to etching of deep etch<br>
structures (for example markings, ornaments/patterns). Areas of application<br>
are, for example:<br>
• the production of viewing windows for valves and measuring equipment of<br>
all types<br>
• the production of glass supports for outdoor applications (for example for<br>
solar cells and heat collectors)<br>
• etched glass surfaces in the medical and sanitary sector, and for<br>
decorative purposes, including artistic and architectural applications<br>
• etched glass containers for cosmetic articles, foods and drinks<br>
• specific partial etching of glasses and other silicon oxide-based systems<br>
for marking and labelling purposes, for example for marking/labelling<br>
container glass and flat glass<br>
• specific partial etching of glasses and other silicon oxide-based systems<br>
for mineralogical, geological and microstructural studies<br>
In particular, screen printing, silk-screen printing, pad printing, stamp printing<br>
and ink-jet printing methods are suitable techniques for applying the etching<br>
pastes as desired. In general, besides the said printing methods, manual<br>
application (for example brush) is also possible.<br>
Besides industrial application, the etching pastes are also suitable for DIY<br>
and hobby needs.<br>
The printable, homogeneous, particle-free etching pastes having non-<br>
Newtonian flow behaviour which are described in accordance with the<br>
invention can be employed in all cases where layers of glasses and other<br>
silicon oxide-based and silicon nitride-based systems of variable thickness<br>
are to be etched over the entire area and/or in a structured manner. Areas of<br>
application are, for example:<br>
• all etching steps on layers of silicon oxide- and silicon nitride-based<br>
glasses and other silicon oxide- and silicon nitride-based systems which<br>
result in the production of photovoltaic components, such as solar cells,<br>
photodiodes and the like, in particular<br>
a) the removal of silicon oxide/doped silicon oxide (for example<br>
phosphorus glass after n-doping of the solar cell) and silicon nitride<br>
layers<br>
b) the selective opening of passivation layers of silicon oxide and silicon<br>
nitride for the generation of two-stage selective emitters (after opening,<br>
re-doping in order to produce n+ + layers) and/or local p+ back surface<br>
fields (BSFs)<br>
c) edge etching of silicon oxide- and/or silicon nitride-coated solar-cell<br>
panels<br>
• all etching steps on layers of silicon oxide- and silicon nitride-based<br>
glasses and other silicon oxide- and silicon nitride-based systems which<br>
result in the production of semiconductor components and circuits and<br>
which require the opening of passivation layers of silicon oxide and silicon<br>
nitride<br>
• all etching steps on layers of silicon oxide- and silicon nitride-based<br>
glasses and other silicon oxide- and silicon nitride-based systems which<br>
result in the production of components in high-performance electronics<br>
In particular, screen printing, silk-screen printing, pad printing, stamp printing<br>
and ink-jet printing methods are suitable techniques for application of the<br>
etching pastes as desired. In general, besides the said printing methods,<br>
manual application is also possible.<br>
Besides industrial application, the etching pastes are also suitable for DIY<br>
and hobby needs.<br>
Examples<br>
For better understanding and for illustration, examples are given below which<br>
are within the scope of protection of the present invention, but are not<br>
suitable for restricting the invention to these examples.<br>
Example 1<br>
21 g of ethylene glycol monobutyl ether<br>
39 g of 35% NH4HF2 solution<br>
30 g of formic acid (98-100%)<br>
10 g of PVP K-120<br>
Ethylene glycol monobutyl ether and formic acid are introduced into a PE<br>
beaker. An aqueous 35% NH4HF2 solution is then added. PVP K-120 is then<br>
added successively with stirring (at least 400 rpm). During the addition and<br>
for about 30 minutes thereafter, vigorous stirring must be continued. The<br>
transfer into containers takes place after a short standing time. This standing<br>
time is necessary so that the bubbles formed in the etching paste are able to<br>
dissolve.<br>
This mixture gives an etching paste with which silicon oxide- and silicon<br>
nitride-based glasses and other silicon oxide- and silicon nitride-based<br>
systems and their layers can be etched specifically down to the desired depth<br>
over the entire area or in structures with and/or without input of energy.<br>
The etching rate, determined by photospectrometry, on a thermally generated<br>
silicon oxide layer is 120 nm/min in the case of etching over the entire area.<br>
The etching rate, determined by photospectrometry, on a silicon nitride layer<br>
generated by means of PE-CVD (refractive index n = 1.98) is 70 nm/min in<br>
the case of etching over the entire area.<br>
The etching paste obtained has a long shelf life, is easy to handle and is<br>
printable. It can be removed from the printed material or from the paste<br>
carrier (screen, knife, silk screen, stamp, klischee, cartridge, etc.), for<br>
example, using water, or burnt out in an oven.<br>
Example 2<br>
22 g of triethylene glycol monomethyl ether<br>
43 g of 35% NH4HF2 solution<br>
20 g of demineralized water<br>
12 g of PVP K-120<br>
Triethylene glycol monomethyl ether is initially introduced, and all the liquid<br>
components are added with stirring as in Example 1. Finally, the thickener<br>
PVP K-120 is introduced successively with stirring (at least 400 rpm). During<br>
the addition and for about 30 minutes thereafter, vigorous stirring must be<br>
continued. The transfer into containers takes place after a short standing<br>
time. This standing time is necessary in order that the bubbles formed in the<br>
etching paste are able to dissolve.<br>
This mixture gives an etching paste with which silicon oxide- and silicon<br>
nitride-based glasses and other SiO2- and silicon nitride-based systems and<br>
their layers can be etched specifically down to the desired depth over the<br>
entire area or in structures with and/or without input of energy.<br>
The etching rate, determined by photospectrometry, on a thermally generated<br>
silicon oxide layer is 106 nm/min in the case of etching over the entire area.<br>
The etching paste obtained has a long shelf life, is easy to handle and is<br>
printable. It can be removed from the printed material or from the paste<br>
carrier (screen, knife, silk screen, stamp, klischee, cartridge, etc.), for<br>
example, using water or burnt out in an oven.<br>
Example 3<br>
12 g of solid NH4HF2<br>
142 g of lactic acid<br>
10 g of ethylcellulose<br>
36 g of ethylene glycol monobutyl ether<br>
The ethylcellulose is stirred successively into the initially introduced ethylene<br>
glycol monobutyl ether at 40°C in a water bath. The solid NH4HF2 is dissolved<br>
in the lactic acid, likewise with stirring, and subsequently added to the<br>
ethylcellulose stock paste. The two together are then stirred at 600 rpm for 2<br>
hours.<br>
This mixture gives an etching paste with which silicon oxide- and silicon<br>
nitride-based glasses and other silicon oxide- and silicon nitride-based<br>
systems and their layers can be etched specifically down to the desired depth<br>
over the entire area or in structures with and/or without input of energy.<br>
The etching rate, determined by photospectrometry, on a thermally generated<br>
silicon oxide layer is 23 nm/min in the case of etching over the entire area.<br>
The etching paste obtained has a long shelf life, is easy to handle and is<br>
printable. It can be removed from the printed material or from the paste<br>
carrier (screen, knife, silk screen, stamp, klischee, cartridge, etc.), for<br>
example, using acetone or butyl acetate or burnt out in an oven.<br>
Example 4<br>
15 g of ethylene glycol monobutyl ether<br>
15 g of triethylene glycol monomethyl ether<br>
29 g of propylene carbonate<br>
72 g of formic acid<br>
46 g of 35% NH4HF2 solution<br>
24 g of PVP K-90<br>
The solvent mixture and the formic acid are introduced into a PE beaker. An<br>
aqueous 35% NH4HF2 solution is then added. PVP K-120 is then added<br>
successively with stirring (at least 400 rpm). During the addition and for about<br>
30 minutes thereafter, vigourous stirring must be continued. The transfer into<br>
containers takes place after a short standing time. This standing time is<br>
necessary so that the bubbles formed in the etching paste are able to<br>
dissolve.<br>
This mixture gives an etching paste with which silicon oxide- and silicon<br>
nitride-based glasses and other silicon oxide- and silicon nitride-based<br>
systems and their layers can be etched specifically down to the desired depth<br>
over the entire area or in structures with and/or without input of energy.<br>
The etching rate, determined by photospectrometry, on a thermally generated<br>
silicon oxide layer is 67 nm/min in the case of selective etching of structures<br>
with a width of about 80 µm. The etching rate, determined by photo-<br>
spectrometry, on a silicon nitride layer generated by means of PE-CVD is<br>
35 nm/min in the case of selective etching of structures with a width of about<br>
100 µm and at an etching temperature of 40°C.<br>
The etching paste obtained has a long shelf life, is easy to handle and is<br>
printable. It can be removed from the printed material or from the paste<br>
carrier (screen, knife, silk screen, stamp, klischee, cartridge, etc.), for<br>
example, using water, or burnt out in an oven.<br>
