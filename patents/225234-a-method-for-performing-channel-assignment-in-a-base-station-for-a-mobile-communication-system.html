				<td>CHANNEL ASSIGNMENT METHOD FOR A BASE STATION IN A<br>
MOBILE COMMUNICATION SYSTEM<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1. Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates generally to a CDMA (Code Division<br>
Multiple Access) mobile communication system, and in particular, to a method for<br>
providing 4 quasi-orthogonal functions (QOF), which are used in association with<br>
256 Walsh codes in a forward link, in a base station transceiver system (BTS) and<br>
a base station controller (BSC).<br>
2. Description of the Related Art<br>
Existing IS-95A/B CDMA communication systems spread a radio channel<br>
with a Walsh function. However, as the 1S-2000 standard introduces new channels<br>
to the forward and reverse links, the existing conventional communication system<br>
lacks the necessary amount of Walsh codes to maintain orthogonality between<br>
channels<br>
Accordingly, there is a need for a method for increasing the number of the<br>
channels, without decreasing the orthogonality between the existing channels. For<br>
the IS-2000 forward link, several methods have been proposed. One method is to<br>
define a quasi-orthogonal function (QOF) necessary for the mobile station thereby<br>
to assign 4 times the channels as compared with the case when the existing Walsh<br>
function is used, and another method is to expand the existing Walsh function<br>
which can generate 64 Walsh codes, so as to generate 256 Walsh codes. The quasi-<br>
orthogonal function (QOF) is commonly applied to IS-2000 forward channels,<br>
such as the fundamental channel (FCH), the dedicated control channel (DCCH)<br>
and the supplemental channel (SCH). However, existing base stations can only<br>
support 64 Walsh code channels.<br>
Now, reference will be made to the types of the channels used in the IMT-<br>
2000 standard .<br>
Every channel is divided into a physical channel and a logical channel.<br>
The logical channel is established over the physical channel, and several logical<br>
channels can be established on a single physical channel. If the physical channel is<br>
released, the logical channel established over the physical channel is automatically<br>
released. It is not necessary to establish another physical channel in order to<br>
establish a certain logical channel. When a physical channel to be established for a<br>
logical channel is already established for another logical channel, the only required<br>
operation is to assign this logical channel to the previously established physical<br>
channel.<br>
The physical channel can be divided into dedicated channels and common<br>
channels according to its characteristics. Dedicated channels are exclusively used<br>
for communication between the BTS and a particular mobile station (MS), and<br>
include a fundamental channel (FCH), a dedicated control channel (DCCH) and a<br>
supplemental channel (SCH). The fundamental channel is used to transmit voice,<br>
data and signaling signals. Such a fundamental channel is compatible with<br>
TIA/EIA-95-B. The dedicated control channel is used to transmit data and<br>
signaling signals. The dedicated control channel supports a discontinuous<br>
transmission (DTX) mode in which data is only transmitted when the upper layer<br>
generates transmission data. Because of this property, the dedicated control<br>
channel is suitable for effectively providing a packet service. The supplemental<br>
channel is used to transmit large amounts of data.<br>
In addition to the dedicated channels stated above, the physical channel<br>
includes a common channel which is used in common by the base station and<br>
several mobile stations. A physical channel for the forward link transmitted from<br>
the BTS to the MS is called a paging channel, and a physical channel for the<br>
reverse link transmitted form the MS to the BTS is called an access channel. These<br>
common channels are compatible with IS-95B.<br>
The logical channels to be assigned on the above physical channels include<br>
a dedicated signaling channel (dsch) and a dedicated traffic channel (dtch). The<br>
dedicated signaling channel can be assigned to the fundamental channel and the<br>
dedicated control channel, which are physical channels. The dedicated traffic<br>
channel can be assigned to the fundamental channel, the dedicated control channel<br>
and the supplemental channel. The dedicated signaling channel is used when the<br>
base station and the mobile station exchange a control signal. The dedicated traffic<br>
channel is used when the base station and the mobile station exchange user data.<br>
The common logical channel to be assigned on the common physical<br>
channel is divided into a common signaling channel (csch) used to transmit control<br>
signal, and a common traffic channel (ctch) use to transmit user data. The common<br>
logical channels are assigned on the paging channel for the forward link, and are<br>
assigned on the access channel for the reverse link.<br>
FIG. i shows a structure of a general mobile communication system. More<br>
specifically, FIG. 1 shows a reference model of a 3G IOS (Interoperability<br>
Specifications) for a digital air interface between a mobile switching center (MSC)<br>
and a base station, and between base stations in the common mobile<br>
communication system.<br>
Referring to FIG. 1, between MSC 20 and BSC 32, a signal is defined as<br>
an Al interface and user information is defined as an A2/A5 (circuit data) interface.<br>
An A3 interface is defined to connect a target BS 40 to a frame<br>
selection/distribution unit (SDU) function block 34 of a source BS 30 for<br>
soft/softer handoff between base stations. The signaling and user traffic between<br>
the target BS 40 and the SDU function block 34 of the source BS 30 are<br>
transmitted through the A3 interface. An A7 interface is defined for signal<br>
exchange between the target BS 40 and the source BS 30, for soft/softer handoff<br>
between the base stations. In the CDMA mobile communication system, a wired<br>
communication link between the base station 30 and the base station 40, and<br>
between the base station 30 and the MSC 20, is comprised of a forward link<br>
transmitted from the MSC 20 to the base station 30, a reverse link transmitted from<br>
the base station 30 to the MSC 20 and a line connected between the MSC 20 and<br>
the base station 30.The MSC 20 includes a call control and mobility management<br>
block 22 and a switching block 24. Further, the MSC 20 is connected to a data<br>
network such as the Internet through an interworking function (IWF) block 50.<br>
FIG. 2 shows a procedure for exchanging signals between the BTS and the<br>
BSC (more specifically, the SDU function block in the BSC, BSC-SDU) according<br>
to the prior art. The operation can be performed either between the BSC 32 (or<br>
BSC-SDU 34) and the BTS 36 in the source BS 30, or between the BSC 42 and the<br>
BTS 44 in the target BS 40. FIG.2 is independent of types of the required physical<br>
channel, i.e., DCCH, FCH, SCH and whatever. That is, the invention in this<br>
document can be applied to all types of physical channels.<br>
Referring to FIG. 2, the BTS determines forward and reverse channels to<br>
be established with the MS and then generates a signaling message (more<br>
specifically, a connect message) necessary for channel establishment, in step 201.<br>
The generated signaling message includes a frame selector (or channel type) and<br>
channel information. The detailed operation of step 201 will be described later<br>
with reference to FIG. 3. The BTS sends the generated connect message to the<br>
BSC in step 203. Upon receipt of the connect message, the BSC analyzes the<br>
received connect message to check the channel assigned to the MS, and generates<br>
a connect ACK message to be transmitted to the BTS, in step 205. The detailed<br>
operation of receiving the connect message will be described later with reference<br>
to FIG. 4. The BSC sends the generated connect ACK message to the BTS in step<br>
207. The connect ACK message includes information for acknowledging<br>
establishment of the channel requested by the BTS. The BTS then assigns the<br>
acknowledged channel to the MS in step 209.<br>
Summarizing the operation of FIG. 2, the BTS generates the connect<br>
message including information about a channel to be assigned to the MS and sends<br>
the generated connect message to the BSC. Upon receipt of the connect message,<br>
the BSC processes the received connect message, generates the connect ACK<br>
message for acknowledging channel assignment and sends the generated connect<br>
ACK message to the BTS. The BTS then assigns the acknowledged channel to the<br>
MS.<br>
FIG. 3 shows a detailed procedure for transmitting the connect message<br>
according to the prior art. This operation is performed when the BTS transmits the<br>
connect message to the BSC-SDU when it is required to assign a channel to the<br>
MS. The structures of the connect message transmitted from the BTS to the BSC-<br>
SDU are shown in FIGS. 5A and 5B.<br>
Referring to FIG. 3, the BTS determines in step 301 whether the channel<br>
to be assigned to the MS is a supplemental code channel (SCCH). SCCH is the IS-<br>
2000 defined name corresponding to IS-95B SCH(Supplemental Channel). [As I<br>
said earlier,] IS-2000 is on the evolution path of IS-95A/B. IS-2000 also has the<br>
IS-95 A/B channels for maintaining the backward compatibility. It is determined in<br>
step 301 that the channel to be assigned to the MS is SCCH, the BTS sets<br>
(designates) in step 303 the frame selector (or channel type) in the connect<br>
message, whose structure is shown in FIGS. 5A and 5B, to 1S-95B SCCH, so as to<br>
enable the BSC to recognize that the channel to be assigned is an IS-95B channel,<br>
and then designates a Walsh code with 6-bit channel information. Thereafter, in<br>
step 305, the BTS ignores an information element overlapped due to establishment<br>
of the IS-95 A/B fundamental channel in the connect message, whose structure is<br>
shown in FIGS. 5A and 5B, Cell Information, Extended Handoff Parameters in A3<br>
Connect Information element are overlapped with those in the same Connect<br>
message used when IS-95 A/B FCH was newly established. IS-95B SCCH<br>
establishment procedure follows the IS-95 A/B FCH establishment procedure. IS-<br>
95B SCCH have to be established in parallel to IS-95 A/B FCH under the same cell<br>
fills all other information elements to complete the connect message, and then<br>
transmits the connect message to the BSC. Here, in a handoff (HO) situation, the<br>
BTS fills all the handoff-related information element.<br>
If it is determined in step 301 that the channel to be assigned to the MS is<br>
not SCCH, the BTS designates in step 307 the frame selector (or channel type) in<br>
the connect message shown in FIGS. 5A and 5B to the fundamental channel, so as<br>
to enable the BSC to recognize that the channel to be assigned is an IS-95B<br>
fundamental channel, and then designates a Walsh code with 6-bit channel<br>
information. Thereafter, in step 309, the BTS fills all the information elements in<br>
the connect message of FIGS. 5A and 5B to complete the connect message, and<br>
then transmits the connect message to the BSC. Here, in the handoff (HO) situation,<br>
the BTS fills all the handoff-related information element.<br>
FIG. 4 shows a procedure for receiving the connect message according to<br>
the prior art. This operation is performed when the BSC-SDU receives the connect<br>
message for requesting channel assignment, transmitted from the BTS, and<br>
generates a connect ACK message for the connect message.<br>
Referring to FIG. 4, the BSC-SDU receives the connect message for<br>
requesting channel assignment from the BTS in step 401. In step 401, the BSC-<br>
SDU analyzes the received connect message, and examines the establishment-<br>
requested channel in the message of FIGS. 5A and 5B and an identifier of a traffic<br>
channel between the BTS and BSC. The BSC-SDU assigns the traffic channel<br>
between the BSC and BTS, corresponding to the radio channel, in step 403. As a<br>
result, channel connection among BSC-BTS-MS is completed. Further, in step 405,<br>
the BTS-SDU fills all the information elements of the connect ACK message<br>
shown in FIG. 6 and transmits it to the BTS.<br>
A simplified structure of the connect ACK message shown in FIG. 6 will<br>
be described with reference to Table 1 below.<br>
The connect message shown in Table 1 is an A3 message transmitted when<br>
the target BS 40 initiates or adds one or more A3 user traffic connections to the<br>
SDU 34 of the source BS 30. The A3 message includes the following information.<br>
- Message Type II : an information element indicating A3/A7 message<br>
type<br>
- Call Connection Reference : an information element for uniquely<br>
dividing call connection over all zones. This value is always maintained during call<br>
connection over every handoff.<br>
- Correlation ID : an information element used to correlate a request<br>
message with a response message for the request message<br>
- SDU ID : an information element for identifying a specific SDU instance<br>
in one SDU node<br>
A3 Connect Information : an information element used to add one or<br>
more cells to one new A3 connection or existing A3 connection. This information<br>
element field is shown in Table 2 below, and 4th to (j-1)th octets of Table 2 include<br>
Cell Information Record fields of Table 3 below.<br>
Table 3 shows a message including air interface channel information for<br>
the cells attached to one call leg, and each field is defined as follows.<br>
- Length : the number of octets of the elements following a Length field<br>
- Cell Identification Discriminator : a value used to describe the formats<br>
following a Cell Identification field according to cells<br>
- Cell Identification : identification of the cells relating to A3 connection<br>
- Reserved : this value is set to '00000'.<br>
- New Cell Indicator : a field indicating whether a corresponding cell is a<br>
cell newly added to A3 traffic connection in the present procedure or a cell which<br>
previously exists in A3 connection.<br>
- PWRComb lnd : a power control symbol combining indicator. The<br>
BTS sets this field to ' 1', if a forward traffic channel relating to the corresponding<br>
pilot transmits the same bits as closed-loop power control subchannel bits of a<br>
previous pilot in this message. Otherwise, the BTS sets this field to '0'. When this<br>
record occurs first in this element, the BTS sets this field to '0'.<br>
- PilotPN : this field includes a PN sequence offset corresponding to the<br>
related cell and is set in a unit of 64 PN chips.<br>
- CodeChan : this field includes a code channel index corresponding to<br>
the related cell. The BTS sets a value used on the forward traffic channel in<br>
connection with a designated pilot to one of 0 to 63.<br>
A simplified structure of the connect ACK. message shown in FIG. 6 will<br>
be described with reference to Table 4 below.<br>
The connect ACK message of Table 4 is an A3 message for transmitting<br>
A3-CDMA Long Code Transition Directive results performed on the A3 signaling<br>
interface from the target BS 40 to the SDU 34 of the source BS 30. Further, an A3<br>
CDMA Long Code Transition Directive Ack message for the A3 CDMA Long<br>
Code Transition Directive of Table 4 is shown in Table 5 below.<br>
The A3 CDMA Long Code Transition Directive Ack message of Table 5<br>
includes the following information elements.<br>
- Message Type II : an information element indicating an A3/A7 message<br>
type<br>
- Call Connection Reference : an information element for uniquely<br>
dividing call connection over all zones. This value is always maintained during call<br>
connection over every handoff.<br>
- SDU ID : an information element for identifying a specific SDU instance<br>
in one SDU node<br>
- PMC Cause : an information element indicating failed results of A3/A7<br>
message<br>
- Cell Information Record (Committed, Uncommitted) : a Cell Information<br>
Record field of Table 3 is used, as it is. This is an information element including<br>
air interface channel information for the cells attached to one call leg. When<br>
successful, this field is set to 'Committed', and when failed, this field is set to<br>
'Uncommitted'. This field is used together with the PMC Cause field.<br>
Problems of the existing channel assignment method will be described<br>
based on the foregoing descriptions.<br>
As described with reference to Tables 1 to 5, in the conventional 3G IOS<br>
radio channel information, the quasi-orthogonal function (QOF) specified in the<br>
CDMA-2000 standard is not defined. Further, only 64 Walsh codes of 0 to 63 are<br>
supported for the code channels. Thus, when the base station does not support the<br>
quasi-orthogonal function (QOF) which is necessary for the mobile station, the 3G<br>
forward radio channel cannot be assigned in the mobile station. Therefore, it is<br>
necessary to define a message field which can support the quasi-orthogonal<br>
function (QOF) and 256 Walsh codes for the radio channel information in the<br>
existing 3G IOS.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE TNVENTION<br>
It is, therefore, an object of the present invention to provide a method for<br>
expanding existing 64 supportable Walsh codes to 256 Walsh codes and supporting<br>
a quasi-orthogonal function (QOF) for a forward channel in a base station of a<br>
mobile communication system.<br>
To achieve the above objects, there is provided a method for performing<br>
channel assignment in a base station for a mobile communication system. Upon<br>
receipt of a request for assigning a channel to a mobile station, a base station<br>
transceiver system (BTS) generates a connect message including channel<br>
information indicating a Walsh code to be used for a channel to be assigned to the<br>
mobile station, out of 256 Walsh codes, and information indicating a quasi-<br>
orthogonal function (QOF) index, and transmits the generated connect message to<br>
a base station controller (BSC). The BTS generates a connect ACK message for<br>
acknowledging the channel assignment-related information included in the connect<br>
message and transmits the generated connect ACK message to the BSC. Upon<br>
receipt of the connect ACK message, in the BTS assigns a channel acknowledged<br>
by the BSC to the mobile station. ,<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
A preferred embodiment of the present invention will be described herein<br>
below with reference to the accompanying drawings. In the following description,<br>
well-known functions or constructions are not described in detail since they would<br>
obscure the invention in unnecessary detail.<br>
In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, a base station supports a<br>
quasi-orthogonal function (QOF), defined by IS-2000, necessary for the mobile<br>
station and 256 Walsh codes, in addition to the maximum 64 code channels defined<br>
by the existing IS-95A/B.<br>
FIG. 7 shows a procedure for transmitting a connect message according to<br>
a preferred embodiment of the present invention. In this procedure, the BTS<br>
transmits the connect message to BSC-SDU when it is necessary to assign a<br>
channel to the MS. A detailed structure of the Cell Information Record included in<br>
the connect message transmitted from the BTS to the BSC-SDU will be described<br>
later with reference to FIG. 6.<br>
Referring to FIG. 7, the BTS determines in step 701 whether a channel to<br>
be assigned to the MS is SCCH. If it is determined in step 701 that the channel to<br>
be assigned is SCCH, the BTS designates in step 713 the frame selector (or<br>
channel type) shown in FIG. 6 to 'IS-95B SCCH' so as to enable the BSC to<br>
recognize that the channel to be assigned is an IS-95B channel, and designates a<br>
Walsh code with 6-bit channel information. Then, in step 715, the BTS ignores the<br>
information elements overlapped due to establishment of IS-2000 FCH RC 1/2 in<br>
the connect message shown in FIG. 5, fills all the remaining elements to generate<br>
(or complete) the connect message, and transmits the generated connect message<br>
to the BSC. Here, in the handoff situation, the BTS fills the handoff-related<br>
information elements to complete the connect message, and transmits the connect<br>
message to the BSC.<br>
If it is determined in step 701 that the channel to be assigned is not SCCH,<br>
the BTS determines in step 703 whether the channel to be assigned is a<br>
supplemental channel (SCH). If it is determined in step 703 that the channel to be<br>
assigned is the supplemental channel, the BTS determines in step 707 whether to<br>
perform QOF masking on the channel to be assigned.<br>
If it is determined in step 707 that QOF masking should be performed on<br>
the channel, the BTS designates in step 717 the frame selector (or channel type)<br>
shown in FIG. 6 to 'SCH' so as to enable the BSC to recognize that the channel to<br>
be assigned is a supplemental channel. Further, the BTS designates the channel<br>
information indicating a Walsh code to be assigned to the channel bit (8 bits or 11<br>
bits) of IS-2000, 8 bits can support up to 256 Walsh Codes. However, 1S-2000 is<br>
describing 11 bits for specifying Walsh Codes even if the present IS-2000 can<br>
support up to 256 Walsh Codes. The remaining 3 bits are prepared for the future<br>
extension. For the compliance with IS-2000, 11 bits is O.K. But, just 8 bits are<br>
sufficient to the present need and then designates a QOF mask index (=01,10,11)<br>
corresponding to the Quasi orthogonal function codes to be assigned. Then, in step<br>
719, the BTS ignores the information elements overlapped due to establishment of<br>
the fundamental channel (FCH) and the dedicated control channel (DCCH) in the<br>
connect message shown in FIG. 5, fills all the remaining elements to complete the<br>
connect message, and transmits the connect message to the BSC. Here, in the<br>
handoff situation, the BTS fills the handoff-related information elements of the<br>
message shown in FIG. 5 to complete the connect message, and transmits the<br>
connect message to the BSC.<br>
If it is determined in step 707 that QOF masking should not be performed<br>
on the channel to be assigned, the BTS designates in step 721 the frame selector<br>
(or channel type) to 'SCH' so as to enable the BSC to recognize that the channel to<br>
be assigned is a supplemental channel. Further, the BTS designates the channel<br>
information indicating a Walsh code to be assigned to the channel bit number (8<br>
bits or 11 bits) of IS-2000, and then sets the QOF mask index '00',. Here, the QOF<br>
mask index is set to '00', since QOF masking should not be performed. Then, in<br>
step 723, the BTS ignores the information elements overlapped due to<br>
establishment of the fundamental channel (FCH) and the dedicated control channel<br>
(DCCH) in the connect message shown in FIG. 5, fills all the remaining elements<br>
to complete the connect message, and transmits the connect message to the BSC.<br>
Here, in the handoff situation, the BTS fills the handoff-related information<br>
elements of the message shown in FIG. 5 to complete the connect message, and<br>
transmits the connect message to the BSC.<br>
Meanwhile, if it is determined in step 703 that the channel to be assigned<br>
is not the supplemental channel, the BTS determines in step 705 whether the<br>
channel to be assigned is a fundamental channel (FCH). If it is determined in step<br>
705 that the channel to be assigned is a fundamental channel, the BTS examines in<br>
step 709 whether QOF masking should be performed on the channel to be assigned.<br>
If it is determined in step 709 that QOF masking should be performed on<br>
the channel, the BTS designates in step 725 the frame selector (or channel type)<br>
shown in FIG. 6 to 'FCH' so as to enable the BSC to recognize that the channel to<br>
be assigned is a fundamental channel. Further, the BTS designates the channel<br>
information indicating a Walsh code to be assigned to the channel bit number (8<br>
bits or 11 bits) of IS-2000, and then designates a QOF mask index (=01,10,11)<br>
corresponding to the Quasi orthogonal function codes to be assigned. Then, in step<br>
727, the BTS fills all the information elements included in the connect message<br>
shown in FIG. 5 to complete the connect message, and transmits the connect<br>
message to the BSC. Here, in the handoff situation, the BTS fills the handoff-<br>
related information elements of the message shown in FIG. 5 to complete the<br>
connect message, and transmits the connect message to the BSC.<br>
If it is determined in step 709 that QOF masking should not be performed<br>
on the channel to be assigned, the BTS designates in step 729 the frame selector<br>
(or channel type) to 'FCH' so as to enable the BSC to recognize that the channel to<br>
be assigned is a fundamental channel. Further, the BTS designates the channel<br>
information indicating a Walsh code to be assigned to the channel bit number (8<br>
bits or 11 bits) of IS-2000, and then sets the QOF mask index to '00'. Here, the<br>
QOF mask index is set to '00', since QOF masking should not be performed. Then,<br>
in step 731, the BTS fills all the information elements included in the connect<br>
message shown in FIG. 5 to complete the connect message, and transmits the<br>
connect message to the BSC. Here, in the handoff situation, the BTS fills the<br>
handoff-related information elements of the message shown in FIG. 5 to complete<br>
the connect message, and transmits the connect message to the BSC.<br>
However, if it is determined in step 705 that the channel to be assigned is<br>
not the fundamental channel, the BTS determines in step 711 whether QOF<br>
masking should be performed on the channel to be assigned. If it is determined in<br>
step 711 that QOF masking should be performed on the channel, the BTS<br>
designates in step 733 the frame selector (or channel type) shown in FIG. 6 to<br>
'DCCH' so as to enable the BSC to recognize that the channel to be assigned is a<br>
dedicated control channel. Further, the BTS designates the channel information<br>
indicating a Walsh code to be assigned to the channel bit number (8 bits or 11 bits)<br>
of IS-2000, and then designates a QOF mask index (=01,10,11) corresponding to<br>
the Quasi orthogonal function codes to be assigned. Then, in step 735, the BTS<br>
fills all the information elements included in the connect message shown in FIG. 5<br>
to complete the connect message, and transmits the connect message to the BSC.<br>
Here, in the handoff situation, the BTS fills the handoff-related information<br>
elements of the message shown in FIG. 5 to complete the connect message, and<br>
transmits the connect message to the BSC.<br>
If it is determined in step 711 that QOF masking should not be performed<br>
on the channel to be assigned, the BTS designates in step 737 the frame selector<br>
(or channel type) to 'DCCH' so as to enable the BSC to recognize that the channel<br>
to be assigned is a dedicated control channel. Further, the BTS designates the<br>
channel information indicating a Walsh code to be assigned to the channel bit<br>
number (8 bits or 11 bits) of IS-2000, and then sets the QOF mask index '00'. Here,<br>
the QOF mask index is set to '00', since QOF masking should not be performed.<br>
Then, in step 739, the BTS fills all the information elements included in the<br>
connect message shown in FIG. 5 to complete the connect message, and transmits<br>
the connect message to the BSC. Here, in the handoff situation, the BTS fills the<br>
handoff-related information elements of the message shown in FIG. 5 to complete<br>
the connect message, and transmits the connect message to the BSC.<br>
Table 6 below shows the detailed structure of Cell Information Record for<br>
supporting the quasi-orthogonal function (QOF) and the 256 Walsh codes. The<br>
Cell Information Record includes a QOF_MASK field for recording the QOF<br>
mask index according to the present invention and a Code_Chan field for<br>
designating 256 Walsh codes. Upon receipt of the connect message including the<br>
above fields, the BSC analyzes the channel assignment-related information<br>
recorded in the above fields, and then transmits a connect ACK message including<br>
ACK information for the connect message. Upon receipt of the connect ACK<br>
message, the BTS assigns the channel to the MS.<br>
As described above, the present invention provides a signaling message<br>
and a procedure for processing the signaling message such that the base station can<br>
support the quasi-orthogonal function (QOF) necessary for the mobile station. In<br>
this manner, the base station and the mobile switching center can assign 256 Walsh<br>
codes for the radio channels.<br>
While the invention has been shown and described with reference to a<br>
certain preferred embodiment thereof, it will be understood by those skilled in the<br>
