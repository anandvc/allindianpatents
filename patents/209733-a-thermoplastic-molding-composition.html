COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10 ; rule 13]]<br>
"A THERMOPLASTIC MOLDING COMPOSITION"<br>
BAYER AKTIENGESELLSCHAFT,   a German  company,  of D-51368 Leverkusen, Germany.<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br><br><br>
ORIGINAL<br>
311/MUMNP/2003<br><br><br>
GRANTED<br>
6-11-2006<br><br><br>
The subject of the present invention are compositions containing matrix polymer, graft polymer and special additive mixtures, their use for the production of moulded articles, as well as the moulded articles obtainable therefrom. The subject of the invention is also the additive combination.<br>
ABS moulding compositions have already been used for many years in large quantities as thermoplastic resins for the production of all types of moulded parts. The property spectrum of these resins ranges from relatively brittle to extremely tough.<br>
A special area of use of ABS moulding compositions is the production of moulded parts by injection moulding (e.g. housings, toys, vehicle parts), an important factor being in particular a very good flowability of the polymer material. Also, the moulded parts produced in this way must as a rule have a good notched-bar impact strength as well as a good resistance to thermal stresses.<br>
The object therefore exists of achieving, for a given rubber content, a given rubber particle size and a given matrix resin molecular weight, toughness values that are as high as possible while retaining the good thermoplastic flowability. In this connection the high toughness values should as far as possible be obtained independently of the type of matrix resin that is employed, and especially when using the styrene/acrylonitrile copolymers and a-methylstyrene/acrylonitrile copolymers typical of ABS.<br>
One possible way of improving the toughness of ABS polymers with a given rubber content, given rubber particle size and given matrix molecular weight is to add special silicone oil compounds (see EP-A 6521); however, disadvantages may arise such as poor paintability, unsatisfactory printability or impaired yield stress values (danger of stress whitening). The addition of minor amounts of EPDM rubber (see EP-A 412 370) or AES polymer (see EP-A 412 371) has also been described. Both<br><br><br>
methods require the use of considerable amounts of relatively expensive additive components however.<br>
The use of large amounts of individual low molecular weight additive components may in special cases improve the processability, although this is normally offset by a negative effect on other properties such as for example toughness, modulus of elasticity and thermal stability.<br>
It has now been found that by using special additive mixtures, ABS products can be         obtained having a very good combination of notched-bar impact strength (at room temperature as well as at low temperatures) and excellent processability.<br>
The  invention  provides  thermoplastic  moulding  compounds  or  compositions containing<br>

The notched-bar impact strength is measured at room temperature (akRT) and at -30°C  (ak"30°c)  according to  ISO  180/1A  (unit:kJ/m2),  and the thermoplastic flowability is evaluated by measuring the melt flow index (MVR) according to DIN 53 735U(unit:cm3/10min).<br>
As can also be seen from Table 1, only by using the mixtures according to the invention can a very good combination of high toughness even at low temperatures and good processability be obtained.<br><br><br>
