FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0001] The present embodiments relate generally to mobile communication<br>
systems, and more particularly to mobile communication systems that monitor lost<br>
wireless connections.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002] The use of wireless communication is growing exponentially. As a result,<br>
the amount of time an individual spends wirelessly communicating is also drastically<br>
increasing. Therefore, the costs associated with lost connections between parties are<br>
additionally increasing.<br>
[0003] Parties using wireless communication sometimes lose their wireless<br>
connection. Other parties participating in the communication are often at least<br>
temporarily unaware of the lost connection. As a result, significant amounts of time<br>
are often wasted by users waiting for responses and/or trying to deterrnine if another<br>
party to a communication has been lost. Users often may continue to talk or<br>
communicate information even though another party to the communication has been<br>
lost.<br>
[0004] This wasted time can be very frustrating to users and can significantly<br>
degrade a user's experience.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0018] The present embodiments provide apparatuses, methods and systems for<br>
use in notifying a second, remote communication device when a first, local wireless<br>
communication device loses its wireless communication connection or link. Without<br>
this notification, the user of the second, remote communication device is unaware that<br>
the first communication device has lost its link, and the second user may unknowingly<br>
continue to try and communicate and/or wait for a reply for an extended period of<br>
time. This is a waste of the second user's time and can be very frustrating. Therefore,<br>
the present embodiments notify a remote user when a local user loses his/her wireless<br>
link. The quick notification provided by the present embodiments greatly improves<br>
users' experiences and increases users' satisfaction.<br>
[0019] Some embodiments provide methods for use in providing wireless<br>
communication. These methods monitor local wireless communication connections<br><br>
and detect when a wireless communication connection is lost with a first<br>
communication device. A second communication device is determined with which<br>
the first communication device was communicating, and the method notifies the<br>
second communication device of the lost wireless connection. In some<br>
implementations, the second communication device is determined by querying a<br>
server for the second communication device. The method for notifying can, in some<br>
embodiments, include forwarding an in-band tone to the second communication<br>
device and/or generating and forwarding a real time protocol (RTP) packet, hi some<br>
embodiments, the loss of the wireless link is detected through a radio access network<br>
(RAN), a packet control function (PCF), and/or a mobile switching center (MSC).<br>
[0020] Some further embodiments provide a method for use in notifying a user of<br>
a loss of a wireless connection. These methods establish a communication connection<br>
between a first communication device and a second communication device over a<br>
communication network, where the first communication device wirelessly<br>
communicates with the second communication device over at least a first wireless<br>
link. When a loss of the first wireless link with the first communication device is<br>
detected, the methods notify the second communication device of the loss of the<br>
connection with the first communication device. The detection of the loss can<br>
comprise detecting the loss of the wireless link through a PCF, and the notification<br>
can comprise generating a notification from the PCF, and injecting the notification<br>
onto the communication connection directed to the second communication device. In<br>
some implementations, the PCF notifies a server of the detected loss of the wireless<br>
link with the first communication device, and receives an identification of the second<br>
communication device from the server such that the PCF accurately forwards the<br>
notification to the second communication device.<br>
[0021] Systems for use in providing wireless communication are provided in<br>
some embodiments. These systems preferably comprise a base station that wirelessly<br>
communicates with a first communication device over a wireless link, a radio access<br>
network (RAN) coupled with the base station, and a second communication device<br>
communicationally coupled with the first communication device through at least the<br><br>
RAN. The RAN detects a loss of the wireless link and generates a notification and<br>
forwards the notification to the second communication device notifying the second<br>
communication device that the wireless link has been lost. In some implementations,<br>
the RAN comprises a PCF that detects the loss of the wireless link. The system can<br>
further include a packet data serving node (PDSN) coupled with the RAN and further<br>
coupled with a distributed network, such that the second communication device is<br>
communicationally coupled with the first communication device through at least the<br>
RAN, PDSN and the distributed network.<br>
[0022] The operation of the present embodiments enhances user experience and<br>
significantly reduces wasted time when a first user is wirelessly communicating with<br>
a second user and the first user loses the wireless link. In existing communication<br>
networks, the loss of a first party on a wireless connection leaves a second party in<br>
limbo with the second party unaware that the first party has lost the wireless<br>
connection for some period of time. This is particularly relevant when the lost<br>
communication device is unable to signal a loss and/or drop from the communication<br>
link.<br>
[0023] For example, if the first party is communicating over a wireless link to a<br>
second party communicating over a wireless or wired connection, and the first party<br>
loses the wireless link, the second party is unaware that the first party has lost the<br>
wireless link. Some wireless devices can signal the local user directly when the<br>
wireless device loses the connection, however, the other remote party or parties to the<br>
communication are unaware of the loss. The second or remote user is left unnotified<br>
and waiting for further communication. The second user may wait five, eight, ten<br>
seconds or more before realizing that the first party is no longer on the line. This is<br>
particularly apparent at the time the second party is talking or sending a<br>
communication when the first party loses the connection. The second party may<br>
continue to talk for several seconds (e.g., ten seconds or longer) before realizing that<br>
the first user is no longer present on the connection. This can be a significant waste of<br>
time, and is particularly frustrating. It is often difficult to determine what was<br>
communicated and what the first user did not receive.<br><br>
[0024] The present embodiments advantageously address this lack of notification<br>
by signaling and/or notifying a user when another party to a communication loses or<br>
is dropped from a wireless connection. The loss can occur because of a lost wireless<br>
connection (e.g., a lost radio frequency (RF) connection interference, failed handoff<br>
due for example from resource unavailability, etc.), a loss due to a power failure (e.g.,<br>
a mobile phone runs out of battery power), damage to a mobile device (e.g., a user<br>
drops his/her mobile phone), and other such occurrences where a connection is lost.<br>
[0025] In some communication systems and/or networks, the systems distinguish<br>
between data communications versus voice communications, and/or dispatch<br>
communications versus telephony-styled communications. Typically, voice<br>
communications and/or services are real-time applications. Further, these systems<br>
attempt to provide equal service to all users, regardless of locations relative to<br>
transmission stations, such as base transceiver stations (BTS). Further, because voice<br>
communications typically do not communicate large amounts of data, communication<br>
systems typically allocate relatively low or modest data rates while still providing<br>
high-quality voice service.<br>
[0026] Alternatively, systems providing dispatch or direct connect<br>
communications attempt to maximize the amount of data communicated through the •<br>
system. Typically, users have different data rate requirements. In maximizing the<br>
data rates, systems attempt to allocate each user with the maximum data rate that the<br>
user can accept. This allocation is typically also limited by the communication<br>
channel, the interference on the channel, the amount of data bandwidth a user needs<br>
and other such conditions. Data or dispatch communications can also communicate<br>
voice data. For example, data communications include push-to-talk communications<br>
that are treated as data communications avoiding the need to dedicate communication<br>
links, voice over Internet, and other such communications. Employing data<br>
communications with some voice data allows the voice to be broken up and<br>
communicated over optimal routing and recombined to produce the output voice<br>
message. Further, data communications typically are implemented through shared<br><br>
resources, where packets can be communicated over a variety of different connections<br>
and recombined before final transmission to the intended recipient.<br>
[0027] Because of the different structures and applications in communicating<br>
dispatch or direct connect communications versus voice communications, many of the<br>
present embodiments, in some implementations, distinguish between data<br>
communications and voice communications.<br>
[0028] Generally, in implementing a dispatch communication, a first party knows<br>
a private identifier of a second party, and uses the identifier to make a dispatch call to<br>
the second party. Once the first party initiates a dispatch call, the communication<br>
system rapidly sets up the call, and sends a message to the first party's communication<br>
device. Upon receiving the message, the first party's radio generates an audible alert<br>
to let the first party know when to begin speaking and/or communicate data. In<br>
alternative embodiments, the speaker may be permitted to begin speaking prior to<br>
receiving this feedback. The second party's communication device receives the voice<br>
or data signal and plays or make the data available for the second party to receive,<br>
without the second party necessarily having to take any action.<br>
[0029] The nature of dispatch communications, however, makes if very difficult<br>
for one party to determine if and when the party has lost his/her wireless connection.<br>
Because there can be long silences between a first party transmitting a communication<br>
and a second party replying to the first party, the first party is unaware for potentially<br>
long periods of time that the second user has lost the connection. Further, dispatch<br>
communications are typically implemented over half-duplex channels. As such, only<br>
one user communicates at a time, such that a speaking user is unaware that the other<br>
party to the communication has been lost from the connection. Therefore, the<br>
speaking user may continue to speak without knowing the other user is missing and<br>
may wait an excessive amount of time before determining that the other user is no<br>
longer on the connection.<br>
[0030] The present embodiments provide methods and systems for identifying<br>
when one or more parties of a communication are dropped or lose their wireless<br>
connection. The methods and systems quickly notify the other party or parties of the<br><br>
communication that a user lost his/her connection. This saves the party that has not<br>
been dropped from waiting relatively long periods of time before determining that the<br>
other user is no longer on the line.<br>
[0031] FIG. 1 depicts a simplified block diagram of a communication system or<br>
network 110 according to some present embodiments, where a. first wireless device or<br>
mobile station 122 communicates over the network 110 through a dispatch<br>
communication (e.g., push-to-talk (PPT)) with a second wireless device 124 and/or<br>
wired device 126. The wireless devices can be substantially any wireless device<br>
capable of employing dispatch communications, such as wireless phones, pagers,<br>
personal digital assistants, desktop computers, laptop computers, and other such<br>
wireless communication devices. Often dispatch calls are mobile-to-mobile (M-M)<br>
communications, however, the present embodiments can be applied to mobile-to-<br>
wired or land calls (M-L) as well as land-to-mobile calls (L-M). Further, the present<br>
embodiments can be utilized with any relevant wireless communication techniques<br>
including, but not limited to code division multiple access (CDMA), CDMA2000,<br>
global system for mobile communications (GSM), general packet radio service<br>
(GPRS), universal mobile telecommunications systems (UMTS) (including third<br>
generation 3G UMTS), and other such wireless communication techniques.<br>
[0032] The first wireless device 122 transmits and receives communications over<br>
a wireless link 112 with a base station, such as a base transceiver station (BTS) 130<br>
and/or enhanced base transceiver system (EBTS). The BTS forwards and receives<br>
data to and from a packet control function (PCF) 132. The BTS 130 and/or PCF 132<br>
are, in some embodiments, incorporated within a radio access network (RAN) 134.<br>
The RAN provides control and routing of communications to and from the wireless<br>
devices, e.g., wireless device 122.<br>
[0033] The RAN 134 couples with a mobile switching center (MSC) 136. The<br>
MSC switches communications (e.g., telephone calls) within the system or network<br>
110 and also tp the public switched telephone network (PSTN) 160 allowing access to<br>
wired communication devices 126 and other network components. The MSC 136<br><br>
interfaces with the RAN 134 to perform call setup and release, and various functions<br>
such as call processing and supplementary service related functions.<br>
[0034] The PCF 132 of the RAN further couples with and forwards packets of<br>
data to a packet data serving node (PDSN) 138. The PDSN provides access and<br>
gateway functions between the wireless system and a public data network (PDN) 140,<br>
such as an intranet, the Internet and other such distributed networks 140, so that the<br>
first mobile communication device 122 can communicate voice and/or data content<br>
with other communication devices of the network (e.g., second mobile device 124<br>
and/or wired device 126), to access data and/or content on the public data network,<br>
perform other activity such as email, and other similar functions and operations. In<br>
some implementations, the system includes and/or cooperates with conferencing<br>
devices, bridges and/or services 170. These conferencing bridges allow parties to<br>
establish conference calls by the users accessing the bridge 170. Typically, the users<br>
122,124,126 access the conference bridge 170 through a distributed network 140 or<br>
160.<br>
[0035] In operation, the RAN 134 monitors the wireless link 112 to ensure<br>
accurate communication. For example, the RAN can direct the wireless device 122 to<br>
communicate with other BTSs, increase and/or decrease transmission power levels,<br>
and provide other control information with the wireless device. In some<br>
embodiments, the RAN can further detect a loss of the wireless device 122 and/or loss<br>
of the wireless link 112. Upon the detection of a loss of the wireless device 122, the<br>
RAN 134 notifies the PCF 132 to initiate a notification of other users and/or devices<br>
currently communicating with the first wireless device, as fully described below.<br>
[0036] Still referring to FIG. 1, in some embodiments, the system or network 110<br>
can additionally and/or alternatively provide communication paths through a base<br>
station controller (BSC) 180. A third wireless device or mobile station 128 can<br>
communicates with a second wireless device 124 and/or wired device 126 through the<br>
BSC 180. The third wireless device 128 transmits and receives communications over<br>
a wireless link 112 with a BTS 130. The BTS couples with the BSC 180. The BSC<br>
ensures packets are received and forwarded in order, essentially controlling the<br><br>
retransmission aspect of the wireless radio link 112 between the third wireless device<br>
128 and the BTS 130. Further, the BSC 180 includes a PCF 132 and a selector<br>
distributor unit (SDU) 182. The SDU combines signals when a single wireless device<br>
128 can be received by multiple BTSs. The PCF 132 additionally provides some<br>
buffering of packet data for the SDU 182.<br>
[0037] The BSC 180 is typically coupled with an MSC 136. As described above,<br>
the MSC provides switching of calls over the (PSTN) 160 and/or other networks. The<br>
MSC 136 interfaces with the BSC 180 to perform call setup and release, and various<br>
functions such as call processing and supplementary service related functions. The<br>
BSC 180 can, in some implementations, further couple with and forwards packets of<br>
data to a PDSN 138 to establish communication over the network 140. The PCF 134<br>
of the BSC monitors the wireless link with the third wireless device 128. In the event<br>
that the PCF detects a loss of the first wireless device, the PCF notifies other devices<br>
currently communicating with the first wireless device.<br>
[0038] In some embodiments, the PDSN 138 adds addressing header information<br>
so that the packets can be transmitted over the network 140. If the target mobile<br>
communication device (e.g., second wireless device 124) is in a different region of the<br>
network 110, the PDSN can forward the data packets over the network to a second<br>
PDSN (not shown) to remove the header addressing information and forward the<br>
packets to the target wireless device 124.<br>
[0039] The communication network 110 allows for data or dispatch<br>
communications between devices of the network. For example, the first wireless<br>
device 122 can communicate with the second wireless device 124 through push-to-<br>
talk (PTT) capabilities, Voice-over-IP capabilities and other batch and/or data path<br>
communications. Utilizing PTT, the system receives a request, for example, for the<br>
first wireless 122 to establish a data communication between the first and second<br>
wireless devices 122,124. As discussed above, the first user, for example, identifies<br>
the second user and depresses a button on the first wireless device to activate or<br>
initiate communication. Upon establishing a connection with the second device, the<br>
system signals the first device (e.g., causing the first wireless device to generate an<br><br>
audible tone, generate a packet containing the audible coding of beep or other tone,<br>
generate a display, illuminate a light or other such signal) that the connection is<br>
established. The first and second users can then alternately verbally communicate<br>
with one another. Typically, only one communication device communicates at a<br>
given time, and communication between the two wireless devices is achieved by<br>
alternating the control of the connection between the two wireless devices. Further,<br>
the system typically provides a half duplex channel where communicating devices<br>
share the channel with one device controlling the channel at a time.<br>
[0040] In some preferred embodiments, the RAN 134 and/or PCF 132 monitor<br>
the wireless link of the associated wireless device. For example, the RAN 134 or PCF<br>
132 monitor the wireless link 112 with the first wireless device 122 and/or the PCF<br>
132 monitors the link with the third wireless device 128. If the RAN 134 and/or PCF<br>
132 detects that the link 112 is no longer active the PCF generates a notification that<br>
the first wireless device 122 (or third device 128) no longer has an active link. In<br>
some implementations, the PCF generates a notification that is forwarded to a second<br>
user currently communicating with the first user (e.g., user communicating through<br>
wireless device 124). The notification indicates that the first wireless device 122 lost<br>
the wireless connection 112. For example, the PCF 132 can generate and inject a<br>
brief real time protocol (RTP) packet into the communication with the second device.<br>
The real time protocol packet notifies the second user that the first user lost the<br>
wireless link 112. The notification can cause the second communication device 124<br>
to generate an audible tone, to display a message, to illuminate or flash a light, can be<br>
a generated packet containing an audible coding of a tone, and/or other similar<br>
functions that notifies the second user of the lost link. In some embodiments, the PCF<br>
additionally and/or alternatively notifies a server 150 of the communication link loss.<br>
The server can then inject and/or fan out the notification to one or more users<br>
communicating with the lost wireless device, and/or other components of the system.<br>
[0041] By having the RAN 134 and/or PCF 132 monitor the wireless link 112,<br>
the system 110 rapidly detects the loss. As a result, the second user is quickly notified<br>
that the first user lost the connection and the second user can take appropriate steps<br><br>
(e.g., try and reconnect, disconnect, and other similar functions), without having to<br>
wait extended periods of time trying to determine whether or not the first user is still<br>
connected.<br>
[0042] FIG. 2 depicts a simplified graphical representation of communication<br>
logic flow 210 between components of the system 110. Following the cooperating of<br>
the first and second communication devices, and once the initiating party (e.g., first<br>
mobile station (MS) 122) receives an indication that the target party (e.g., second<br>
mobile station (MS2) 124) is connected and available to receive audio data, the RAN<br>
134 monitors the wireless link 112 in step 230. Once the RAN identifies a loss of the<br>
link, the RAN issues a release order in step 232 to the first MS 122.<br>
[0043] A lost or dropped connection can be identified by numerous conditions,<br>
lack of signals and/or data, and other such information including, but not limited to,<br>
failing to receive good frames for a predefined period of time on a reverse link, failing<br>
to receive reverse dedicated pilot communications, power control bits, channel quality<br>
information, received signals with errors exceeding a threshold, receiving insufficient<br>
frames and/or bad frames for a period of time, if a signal or signals received from the<br>
wireless device are below a certain quality and/or below a certain quality for a<br>
predefined period, and other such indications and/or combinations of indications.<br>
Generally, if the system fails to receive information informing the system that the<br>
wireless device is active for a predefined and/or unreasonably long period of time, the<br>
RAN and/or PCF identify the link as an RF loss. RF loss can occur for several other<br>
reasons. For example, a disconnect may occur when a call or the resources being<br>
used is preempted or the call is dropped because of resource unavailability (typically<br>
these disconnects occur for lower priority calls), a call might also be dropped if one of<br>
the communication devices has a limited time of operation (e.g., a user is calling with,<br>
a prepaid phone and the minutes run out), and other such disconnects.<br>
[0044] In step 234, the RAN generates a clear request notifying the MSC 136 of<br>
the link failure. In step 236, the RAN generates an A9-Release-A8 message to the<br>
PCF 132 Morming the PCF of the failure. In step 240, the PCF 132 generates and<br>
injects the loss notification to the second mobile station MS2, at which point the<br><br>
second user is aware of the link loss and no longer waits to determine if the first user<br>
is still on line. The notification can be generated through a number of different<br>
techniques. For example, the PCF can generate and inject an audio signal and/or<br>
message, such as an RTP packet to the other communication device (e.g., device 124<br>
and/or 126), the PCF can generate a section initiation protocol (SIP) messaging,<br>
and/or the PCF can generate other similar notifications or combination of notifications<br>
as are known in the art.<br>
[0045] In step 242, the PCF 132 sends an Al 1 registration request message with<br>
a stop airlink request to the PDSN 138, and request the session be shifted to dormant.<br>
The PDSN updates the system data accordingly. In step 244, the MSC 136 upon<br>
receipt of the clear request from the RAN 134 issues a clear command to the RAN. In<br>
step 250, the PDSN 138 replies to the registration request with an Al 1 registration<br>
reply message to the PCF 132. In step 252, the PCF in turn issues an A9-release-A8-<br>
complete acknowledgement to the RAN 134. In step 254, the RAN generates and<br>
forwards a clear complete acknowledgement to the MSC 136.<br>
[0046] In the implementation of the logic flow 210 of FIG. 2, the second mobile<br>
station 124, and thus the second user, are notified relatively early in the process 210.<br>
This saves the second user a significant amount of time, reduces the second user's<br>
frustration, allows for the saving of network resources, and other benefits as described<br>
above and more fully below. Further, the present embodiments can be implemented<br>
without changes to standards and standard communications between system<br>
components. In some preferred embodiments, the equipment failure A9-Release-A8<br>
signal is interpreted as the unexpected call loss, such that the PCF initiates the<br>
notification to the other user(s) of the lost connection.<br>
[0047] FIG. 3 depicts a more detailed graphical representation of communication<br>
logic flow 310 according to some embodiments for the notification in step 240 of<br>
FIG. 2, where the PCF injects the notification to a remote user indicating the loss of<br>
the wireless link with the local user. The RAN detects the link loss with the local<br>
wireless communication device (e.g., device 122) in step 230 of FIG. 2, and generates<br>
an equipment failure notice to the PCF 132 (e.g., an A9-Release-A8 message)<br><br>
informing the PCF of the failure in step 236. Referring to FIG. 3, in step 322, the<br>
PCF generates a loss notification that is directed to the target, remote communication<br>
device (e.g., wired device 126), and forwards the notification to be delivered to the<br>
remote device. The notification can, as described above, be a tone, a text message, a<br>
command to cause the remote device to generate a tone or light up. In some<br>
embodiments, the PCF can utilize a prepared or predefined RTP audio file to provide<br>
the RF link loss indication to the remote device. The RTP packet or packets can be<br>
forwarded to the PDSN 138.<br>
[0048] In step 324, the PDSN 13 8 receives the notification from the PCF, and<br>
formats and communicates the notification over the distributed network 140 to be<br>
received by a remote second PDSN 312. In step 326, the remote PDSN converts the<br>
formatted notification and forwards the notification as an A10 communication to a<br>
remote second PCF 314. In step 330, the remote PCF forwards the notification to the<br>
remote communication device 126. In step 332, the remote communication device<br>
notifies the second user, for example, by generating an audible tone as defined by the<br>
RTP packet(s).<br>
[0049] In some implementations, the RAN 134 and/or the PCF 132 detects the<br>
loss of the wireless link 112 with the first communication device 122. Often,<br>
however, the PCF is unaware or does not know the identity of the second<br>
communication device or how to route the notification to the second communication<br>
device. In some implementations, the PCF attempts to determine or infer the remote<br>
user through the types of communication, addressing within the communications (e.g.,<br>
IP addressing) and other such data. Additionally and/or alternatively in some<br>
embodiments, the PCF 132 upon detection of the lost link, communicates with a<br>
server 150 to identify the second communication device.<br>
[0050] The server 150 can be identified according to types of communication, the<br>
lost user, addressing within the communications, look up tables, and other such<br>
information. In some embodiments, the PCF 132 and/or RAN 134 communicate with<br>
a specific designated server (e.g., a first network server because that is the server<br>
specified by a specific wireless communication carrier). In other embodiments, the<br><br>
PCF/RAN identifies the server based the type of communication, on the user lost,<br>
and/or addressing within the communications (e.g., IP addressing and/or other such<br>
addressing). For example, in some implementations the PCF/RAN (or other network<br>
component) can store users' IP addresses upon initiation of the communication<br>
connection. The stored IP addresses can be later used if the connection should be lost.<br>
The server can be located with the MSC 134, the PDSN 138, a separate server 150<br>
coupled with the distributed networks 140,160 and configured to communicate with<br>
the PDSN, MSC and/or PCF/RAN and provide call processing flows including<br>
distributing forward voice streams to the communication devices (e.g., one or more<br>
wireless devices employing PTT that can be accessed through different PCF/RANs),<br>
, track user billing and other such services. The servers 150 can be operated by the<br>
system 110 provider, other companies provide wireless communication services (e.g.,<br>
Nortel™, Sprint™, Verison™, ATT™ and other such wireless service providers),<br>
and the like.<br>
[0051] Additionally and/or alternatively, some embodiments employ a<br>
conference bridge 170 to monitor the communication between parties of a<br>
communication. Multiple parties establish communication connections by accessing<br>
the conference bridge 170. The conference bridge can detect that one or more users<br>
have been lost. Once a loss is detected the bridge 170 can use that information to<br>
update the conference status, notify the server 150 and/or MSC 136, notify the other<br>
parties participating in the communication, and/or allow the server or MSC to<br>
generate the notification.<br>
[0052] Still further, in some embodiments, the PCF, RAN and/or server can<br>
further verify that the first wireless device 122 was actually participating in<br>
communication with one or more other parties. Once verified, the PCF and/or RAN<br>
initiate the procedures to notify the one or more other parties that the first wireless<br>
device lost the wireless link 112. Additionally in some embodiments, the system<br>
further determines whether a loss was due to an intentional action, such as a user<br>
ended communication, or the network intentionally dropping the connection (e.g.,<br>
aborting the call, selecting another operating mode, reconnecting to a cell not able to<br><br>
service the wireless device, preempted call, unavailable resources, prepaid minutes<br>
expire, and other such conditions) or the loss was unintentional.<br>
[0053] FIG. 4 depicts a simplified flow diagram of a process 410 according to<br>
some embodiments where a radio frequency (RF) link loss is detected by a PCF and<br>
the PCF generates a notification. In step 420, the PCF detects the link loss. As<br>
described above, the PCF can directly detect the link loss and/or can be signaled by<br>
the RAN about the loss. In step 422, the PCF determines if the local communication<br>
device was actively participating in a communication (e.g., during a PTT either to or<br>
from the MS, or during a PTT "call"; if a PTT from either party occurred within the<br>
past THOLD seconds, where THOLD may equal, for example, six seconds). If the<br>
local device was not actively participating in a communication, the process 410<br>
terminates. Alternatively, if the local device was participating in a communication,<br>
the process continues to step 424 where the PCF determines if the loss was due to an<br>
intentional or normal connection drop (e.g., call is aborted; another operating mode is<br>
selected; reconnecting to a cell not able to service the wireless device; and other such<br>
actions). If the loss is due to an intentional disconnect, the PCT prevents the<br>
notification to the remote device and terminates the process 410.<br>
[0054] If it is determined in step 424 that the communication loss is not due to an<br>
expected normal disconnect, the process continues to step 426. Losses caused by<br>
unexpected disconnects can be caused by an number of effects and/or conditions such<br>
as the local device passes into a tunnel or other area that blocks wireless signals,<br>
power is lost to the device (e.g., battery is disconnected), the device is damages (e.g.,<br>
user drops the device, or something lands or rolls over the device) and other such<br>
conditions. In step 426, the PCF communicates with a server 150 and/or a local MSC<br>
136 to identify the one or more additional target communication devices actively<br>
participating in the communication with the lost local device. In. step 430, the server<br>
or MSC identifies the one or more target devices. In step 432, the PCF generates a<br>
notification and communicates the notification to the one or more target devices. The<br>
notification can be substantially any relevant notification including, but not limited to,<br><br>
a session initiation protocol (SEP) message, one or more RTP packets, and other such<br>
notifications.<br>
[0055] The present embodiment additionally allows for the notification of one or<br>
more users losing connections during a group call or conference call with more than<br>
two users. During group calls, the PCF 132 and/or RAN 134 systems associated with<br>
each party of the group call monitors the wireless link of their respective wireless<br>
devices participating in the group call. If a loss is detected, the associated PCF/RAN<br>
generates notifications and injects the notifications to one or more of the users<br>
participating in the communication, hi some embodiments, the PCF/RAN notifies<br>
each of the other participants. For example, the PCF can query a server to identify<br>
each of the parties participating and obtain routing to each of the parties. The PCF<br>
can then generate the notification and inject the notification onto the in-band<br>
communication (e.g., a 250 ms tone).<br>
[0056J In some preferred embodiments, the notification to the one or more<br>
parties is provided so that the notification does not interfere with or. only minimally<br>
interferes with the group call. For example, the notification can be delivered as a text<br>
or display message such that the receiving communication devices display the<br>
notification. Additionally and/or alternatively the notification can cause the receiving<br>
communication devices to generate an audible tone. The tone, however, is typically<br>
low compared with a tone that would be sent to a single user so that the low tone is<br>
non-intrusive on the group call. In some alternative embodiments, the notification is<br>
only forwarded to the originator of the group call, or only the user currently having<br>
control over the group call is notified.<br>
[0057] As is known in the art, typically in group calls using push-to-talk, a user<br>
currently speaking has exclusive rights or "control" of group communication. Some<br>
present embodiments additionally determine when a user is lost if the lost user is the<br>
speaking or controlling user. Once determined that the lost user was the controlling<br>
user, the PCF notifies the MSC that the lost user was the controlling user. The MSC<br>
releases the resources that were allocated to the lost user and further releases the<br>
exclusive control so that the lost user no longer "has the floor" of the group call and<br><br>
that the group communication is now an "open floor." For example, the MSC can<br>
issue a SIP message releasing control of the group call. This allows another user of<br>
the group to take "control" over the group, for example by selecting a push-to-talk:<br>
button on the communication device.<br>
[0058] FIG. 5 depicts a simplified flow diagram of a process 510 for detecting a<br>
loss of one or more parties to a group communication and the notifying of one or<br>
more other parties participating in the group communication. In step 512, the process<br>
detects that a first user has been dropped from a wireless connection. This detection<br>
can be achieved through a PCF, RAN, and/or through an MSC as described above.<br>
Upon detection of a lost user, the process continues to step 514 where it is determined<br>
and/or verified that the first user was actively participating in communication over the<br>
system. If the first user is not confirmed, the process terminates and does not further<br>
notify any other users. Alternatively, if the first user is confirmed, step 516 is entered<br>
where it is determined if the first user is part of a group communication. If the first<br>
user is not part of a group communication, step 520 is entered where the other user of<br>
the communication is notified. In some embodiments, step 520 is implemented<br>
through a separate process, such as the process 210 as described above and depicted<br>
in FIG. 2.<br>
[0059] If it is determined in step 516 that the first user was part of a group<br>
communication, step 530 is entered where the other users participating in the group<br>
communication are identified. In some embodiments, the PCF queries the MSC to<br>
identify the other users. In step 532, the PCF injects a notification to the other users.<br>
As discussed above, the notification can be implemented by an in-band<br>
communication and/or tone that is directed to each of the other participating users.<br>
For example, the PCF can send audio data, such as an RTP packet to the other users,<br>
and/or SIP messaging. In some embodiments, the process continues to step 534<br>
where a number of other users participating in the group communication are<br>
determined, and the PCF adjusts a volume of the in-band communication according to<br>
the number of remaining users participating in the communication.<br><br>
[0060] Still referring to FIG. 5, in step 540, the process determines if the lost first<br>
user was the controlling user. For example, the PCF queries the MSC to determine if<br>
the first user was actively identified as the speaking or controlling party. If it is<br>
determined that the first user was not controlling, the process 510 terminates.<br>
Alternatively, if it is determined that the first user was the controller part, step 542 is<br>
entered where the MSC releases the first user's control, for example, by issuing an ,<br>
SEP message releasing control of the group call.<br>
[0061] The present embodiments can similarly be operated with desktop dispatch<br>
and/or data communications. The present embodiments are further capable of<br>
identifying a loss of the connection with the desktop, for example, desktops using a<br>
digital subscriber line for data communications. Upon the detection of the lost<br>
connection, the other one or more parties of the communication are notified of the<br>
loss such that the other one or more parties do not have to waste time trying to<br>
determine whether the desktop is still connected.<br>
[0062] In the situation when a lost desktop participating in a wireless dispatch<br>
communication is the speaking or the controlling communication device, no end of<br>
the dispatch message is received from the desktop device. In some embodiments, the<br>
PCF 132 and/or RAN 134 monitor the wireless connection. If an end of a<br>
communication from the desktop is not received for a predefined or threshold period<br>
of time, the PCF and/or RAN determine that the desktop has lost the link and generate<br>
the notification to the other users as described above. Additionally and/or<br>
alternatively, the PCF and/or RAN can further monitor RTP/ User Datagram Protocol<br>
(UDP) packets received from the desktop. If RTP/UDP packets are not received from<br>
the desktop for a threshold period of time, the.PCF/RAN determines that the desktop<br>
is lost and generates the notification. The present embodiments for desktop<br>
communication can be employed with cellular networks, local area networks, satellite<br>
communication networks, combinations of these networks, and other such networks.<br>
[0063] The loss of a wireless link 112 can be caused by numerous factors, such<br>
as, the wireless device 122 losing powe'r (e.g., battery being disengages and/or going<br>
dead), the link being released for cause (e.g., aborted call, selection of another<br><br>
operating mode, termination due to fee, reconnecting to a cell not able to serve the<br>
wireless device), and other such causes for release. In these instances, the present<br>
embodiments generate similar notifications as described above to the other one or<br>
more users communicating with a wireless device that is released or disconnected<br>
from a link due to power loss and other abnormal link release. In some instances, the<br>
wireless device detects that the abnormal link release is going to occur and notifies the<br>
system allowing the system to generate the notification to the other user(s) currently<br>
communicating with the wireless device being lost. The notification can be an audio<br>
notification, a text notification, a command to trigger the communication device to<br>
generate a notification (audible tone, flash a light), and other notification. In some<br>
implementations the audio notification can be a voiced announcement, for example, a<br>
voiced message stating "lost call," "dropped call," or other such announcements. The<br>
notification can further distinguish between a link loss and a loss due to battery failure<br>
or other causes. For example, a tone or low beep can be generated to indicate the lost<br>
call is due to a battery failure, while a short audible announcement stating "lost call"<br>
can identify a loss due to a lost communication link.<br>
[0064] Some embodiments generate a notification to a server (e.g., server 150)<br>
when a link loss is detected. The server utilizes the notification to determine one or<br>
more other users participating in a communication with the lost device. The server<br>
then can generate a notification of the loss and fan the notification to all interested<br>
parties. Additionally and/or alternatively, upon receiving a notification of a dropped<br>
user (e.g., notification from a PCF), the communication device (e.g., wireless device<br>
124) can query the server to identify which party or parties were dropped and/or lost.<br>
[0065] The present embodiments provide notifications to users communicating<br>
through short message services (text and/or typed messages). Short messaging<br>
services allow messages to be forwarded from a first user to a second user, and the<br>
second user can type in and forward a follow-up reply. These text communications<br>
can continue through an unlimited number of communications between the users. In<br>
• some embodiments, the text messaging is communicated across one or more traffic<br>
channels. In utilizing traffic channel based text messaging, the present embodiments<br><br>
detect when one of the users loses the link. Upon the detection of the lost link, the<br>
system interjects a notice (e.g., a tone) and/or a text message to the remaining user(s).<br>
The text message or other notification can be generated by the PCF or other system<br>
component as described above.<br>
[0066] Further, the present embodiments advantageously improve the average<br>
user's experience and/or increases network capacity. Users expect a certain level of<br>
quality of service from the wireless network provided, which can be generally equated<br>
to the user experience. If the service is poor, inconsistent and/or painful for the user<br>
(e.g., high percentage of lost calls), the user's experience is lower, and his/or<br>
frustration level with the system increases. Many systems attempt to achieve a<br>
defined fixed sensitivity to achieve a desired user experience. For example, some<br>
systems tolerate a fixed percentage (e.g., 1%, 2% or some other percentage) of lost<br>
connections.<br>
[0067] The present embodiments reduce a users' frustration level by quickly<br>
notifying the user of the lost connection, avoiding long periods of uncertainty of<br>
whether the other user is still on the line, and making link outages less painful. The<br>
quick notification greatly improves users' experiences and increases users'<br>
satisfaction.<br>
[0068] Additionally, users are also likely to remain satisfied, at least at pervious<br>
satisfaction levels, with an increased percentage of lost calls because the present<br>
embodiment notifies the users of the lost connections. This allows the same system to<br>
be operated at a higher capacity. Operating a higher capacity may result in an<br>
increased number of lost connections and/or calls, but users are more tolerant to<br>
losing connections because they are quickly notified. Therefore, the system can<br>
increase capacity without decreasing user satisfaction.<br>
[0069] For example, some systems can increase their tolerated fixed percentage<br>
of lost connections by 1%, 3% or more while still at least maintaining the same user<br>
experience. Some systems may carry, for example, 1.25 times more load when users<br>
tolerate an increase in lost connections from 1% to 5%. In some embodiments,<br>
simulations are employed to estimate the increased percentage of lost connections that<br><br>
will be tolerated while providing the same user experience. These simulations<br>
estimate an increased percentage of lost connections based on a percentage increase in<br>
system capacity. For example, if a system capacity is increased by 10%, the<br>
simulation may define the RF loss probability to be increased by about 2-3%.<br>
Because the present embodiments provide notification, users may tolerate an increase<br>
of 3% of lost connections. Therefore, in one sense of the word capacity, the<br>
simulation defines the increased capacity of about 10%. The ratios between the RF<br>
loss probability and increased capacity depends on the system, the components of the<br>
system, the amount of interference in the area covered and other such factors. The<br>
simulation, however, attempts to take these parameters into consideration and provide<br>
accurate estimations of capacity loads.<br>
[0070] The present embodiments improve user experience with the same system<br>
capacity and/or an increase in system capacity. Additionally and/or alternative, the<br>
present embodiments resulting in users tolerating increased numbers of lost<br>
connections allowing the system to increase system capacity (e.g., system can carry<br>
~1.25x more load, when users tolerate 5% lost connections instead of 1%).<br>
[0071] The present embodiments can, in some embodiments, further release<br>
network resources upon the detection of a lost communication link. The RAN and/or<br>
PCF can forward the notification to the remote user, and further notify the MSC, the<br>
server and/or other system controllers and components. The MSC and/or server can<br>
initiate the release of network resources. Due to the notification to the MSC and/or<br>
other components of the system, the resources can, in some implementations, be freed<br>
up sooner than would have otherwise been freed up. The freed up system resources<br>
can then be utilized with other communications. Further, previous systems typically<br>
continued to upload a users data (e.g., audio) for the user that were not dropped. This<br>
uploaded data is typically just dumped, particularly when the data is not buffered<br>
(e.g., instantaneously transmitted).<br>
[0072] Some present embodiments alternatively buffer or store communicated<br>
data (whether voice or data). The amount of data stored can be defined by any<br>
number of parameters, but not limited to, a period of time, when a user stops talking,<br><br>
until a confirmation or receipt is received from a second user, and other such<br>
parameters. In the event a first user is speaking and the other user of the<br>
corrmiunication is lost, the first user may continue to speak until and/or after the<br>
notification is received. The buffering can similarly save some or all of this<br>
communication data. In some embodiments, the system can forward this stored data<br>
to the second user at a later time, and/or over a different radio frequency technology<br>
or other communication medium (e.g., voice mail, send as email with audio<br>
attachment; or through alternative means).<br>
[0073] Still further, when a first user who is speaking loses the connection, the<br>
buffered data can be saved. This saved data can be later retrieved by the lost user,<br>
and/or other users, so that the user(s) can identify when during a conversation a loss<br>
occurred and what information was and was not communicated.<br>
[0074] The present embodiments provide notification for lost connections for<br>
other types of communication besides batch or data communications. For example,<br>
some embodiments additionally and/or alternatively provide notification of a lost<br>
party during wireless interconnect or standard two-way voice corhmunications. Some<br>
voice interconnect paths allow data to also be communicated, but primarily, voice<br>
paths provide voice communications between two or more users, such as cellular<br>
communications and the like.<br>
[0075] As described above, some wireless devices can detect their own loss of a<br>
connection. These wireless devices can then notify the local user of the loss. For<br>
example, a first wireless device can wirelessly communicate with a second wireless<br>
communication device. If the first wireless device detects a loss of the<br>
communication link (e.g., RF link) with the base station, the first wireless device can<br>
generate a beep indicating to the local owner of the first wireless device that the<br>
wireless link was lost. The first wireless devices and the wireless communication<br>
system are, however, incapable of notifying or initiating a notification to the second<br>
wireless device participating in the communication.<br>
[0076] The second user is unaware of the loss. As such, the second user typically<br>
continues with the conversation and/or waits for further comments from the first user.<br><br>
Because the second user does not know why the first user is not speaking, the second<br>
user may wait extended amounts of time before deciding that the first user is no<br>
longer on the connection. Further, the second user does not know why the first user is<br>
disconnected. This waiting can be a significant waste of time, and is particularly<br>
frustrating. Further, the resources to maintain the connection of the second user is<br>
wasted valuable resources that could be utilized with other users. The ambiguity of a<br>
lost connection can be particularly evident when the user of the wireless device that is<br>
lost is using a speaker phone.<br>
[0077] The present embodiments detect the link loss with a first wireless<br>
communication device and provide notification to one or more other communication<br>
devices that the first wireless device lost the wireless link. This notification<br>
significantly reduces and/or avoids the other user(s) wasting time waiting for the first<br>
user. Further, some embodiment release communication system resources once the<br>
notification has been forward to the other user(s), freeing up the resources for other<br>
communications. Additionally, one or more of the other communication devices can<br>
be shut down and/or instructed to enter into a semi-dormant or RSCI state to<br>
conserver power.<br>
[0078] FIG. 6 depicts a simplified block diagram of a communication system or<br>
network 610 providing voice communication over a voice path. A first wireless<br>
device 622 wirelessly communications over a wireless link 612 with a first base<br>
station or BTS 630 of a first RAN 634. The first RAN further couples with a first<br>
MSC 636.<br>
[0079] The first MSC 636 established communication channels, typically over a<br>
PSTN 652, with one or more wireless devices 672 and/or other wired devices 626.<br>
For example, the first MSC can couple with a second MSC 660 through the PSTN<br>
652. The second MSC 660 couples with a second RAN 662 that includes a second<br>
BTS 664. The BTS 664 wireless communicates over a second wireless link 670 with<br>
a second wireless device 672.<br>
[0080] FIG. 7 depicts a simplified graphical representation of time-line logic<br>
flow 710 of the signaling between components of the communication system<br><br>
according to voice communication systems without the implementation of the present<br>
embodiments. Initially at step 720 a wireless communication link is lost and/or<br>
dropped between a first wireless device 622, such as a first MS, and a transmitter,<br>
such as a BTS 630. The local RAN 634 or local the MSC 636 associated with the<br>
communication link 612 to the first MS 622 detects the loss at step 722. The MSC<br>
instructs, at step 724, the release of the communication path and/or channel to the .<br>
second communication device 672, such as a second MS. The second MS is not<br>
notified and is unaware of the loss of connection with the first MS for an extended<br>
period of time 740. This is wasted time for the second user.<br>
[0081] FIG. 8 depicts a simplified graphical representation of time-line logic<br>
flow 810 of the signaling between components of the communication system, such as<br>
system 610 providing voice communication paths, that implements notification of lost<br>
wireless links according to the present embodiments. At step 820, a wireless<br>
communication link is lost and/or dropped between a first MS 622 and a BTS 63.0.<br>
The local RAN 634 or local MSC 636 associated with the communication link 612 to<br>
the first MS 622 detects the loss at step 822. The MSC or RAN generates and injects<br>
a notification to the second MS 672 of the lost link at step 824. At step 826 the<br>
second user receives the notification. The notification can be a tone or other audio<br>
notification forwarded to the second MS, a command to cause the second MS to<br>
generate a tone, or other such notification. Following the injection of the notification,<br>
the MSC issues commands at step 830 to release of the communication path and/or<br>
channel to the second MS. Because of the early notification, a significant amount of<br>
the second user's time 840 is saved. For example, without the notification the user is<br>
unaware of the lost connection and may stay on and/or continue talking on the line for<br>
5-10 or more seconds. Alternatively, some embodiments generate the notification to<br>
the remaining one or more users of the loss in less than a second. This saves the users<br>
significant amounts of time and frustration.<br>
[0082] In the present embodiments, typically the RAN 634 and/or a PCF detect<br>
the loss of the wireless link with the wireless communication device (e.g.,<br>
communication device 622). The RAN notifies the MSC 636 of the lost link. In<br><br>
some embodiments, the RAN generates and injects the notification to the second<br>
communication device (e.g., communication device 672). The MSC releases the<br>
communication channel with the second communication device after the RAN has<br>
forwarded the notification. In some implementations, the RAN notifies the MSC of<br>
the lost link after the RAN has forwarded the notification. As an example, the MSC<br>
can typically implement a trunk release in about 1,5 seconds. The notification can<br>
typically be generated and forwarded (by the RAN or MSC) in about 0.2 seconds. As<br>
such, the notification is received at the second device about 1.3 second before the<br>
communication trunk is released. Therefore, the present embodiments can save users<br>
at least about 1.3 seconds in instances when a user might notice the release of the<br>
communication channel, and typically can save users significantly longer amounts of<br>
time (e.g., in excess of 5 seconds in some instances) because users typically are<br>
unable to detect the channel has been released and they may continue to talk to the<br>
dead line.<br>
[0083] FIG. 9 depicts a simplified graphical representation of communication<br>
logic flow 910 between components of the system 610 when providing voice<br>
communications over voice communication paths where the serving or local PCF<br>
provides the notification of the lost user. In the process 910, the first MSC 636<br>
generates and forwards the notification of the lost connection. At step 920, a first<br>
local RAN 634 detects a loss of the wireless link 612 between a BTS and a first MS<br>
622. In step 922, the first local RAN issues a release command to the first MS. In<br>
step 924, the first RAN issues a clear request to the first local MSC 636. In step 926,<br>
the first MSC returns a clear command.<br>
[0084] In step 930, the first local MSC 636 generates and injects a notification to<br>
a second remote MS 672 that the first MS was lost. At this point the second user<br>
knows that the first user is lost and does not have to wait any longer to deteraiine if<br>
the first user is present or not.<br>
[0085] The first MSC further issues an Integrated Services Digital Network<br>
(ISDN) user part protocol (ISUP) request in step 932 to release the communication<br>
channel to the PSTN 652. In step 934, the PSTN forwards the ISUP release request to<br><br>
the second remote MSC 660. The second MSC generates a clear command and<br>
forwards the clear command in step 936 to the second remote RAN 662. In step 940,<br>
the second RAN forwards a release order to the second MS 672 to release the wireless<br>
link 670. In step 942, the second MS returns a confirmation of the release order. In<br>
step 944, the second RAN forwards a clear complete notification to the second MSC.<br>
[0086] In some embodiments, the process 910 can include additional, optional<br>
step 950 that occurs prior to step 942 and the confirmation of the release order. In<br>
step 950, the second MS forwards a communication to one or more servers (e.g.,<br>
server 650) notifying the server that the first MS has lost connection. This allows the<br>
servers to release resources, and record transaction statistics (e.g., stop billing for<br>
communication time). When communicating over a voice path, it is often difficult for<br>
the RAN and/or MSC to notify the server of the lost link. However, the end points<br>
(i.e., the MSs) are generally aware or become aware of the lost connection. These end<br>
points are in the same communication group, they are exchanging communications<br>
with each other. As are result, the second MS can initiate the notification to the server<br>
without excess over head.<br>
[0087] The optional step 950 may be beneficial in-many situations. For example,<br>
when a group call is taking place, and the speaking user loses the voice path (RF loss),<br>
the server does not know the speaking user is gone. In step 940, one or more of the<br>
other communication devices (e.g., 672 and/or 626) participating in the conference<br>
call are notified that the speaking user has been lost from the voice path. Step 950<br>
allows the one or more other communication devices to notify the server, allowing the<br>
server to release resources and/or open the control to the other users.<br>
[0088] In some alternative embodiments, the local RAN 634 generates the<br>
notification to the one or more other parties participating in a communication with a<br>
first wireless device that loses the wireless link. FIG. 10 depicts a simplified<br>
graphical representation of communication logic flow 1010 between components of<br>
the system 610 when providing voice communications over voice communication<br>
paths where the serving or local RAN provides the notification of the lost user. In<br>
step 1020, the first local RAN detects the loss of the wireless link 612 with first MS<br><br>
622. In step 1022, the first RAN issues a release order to the first MS. In step 1024,<br>
the first local RAN 634 generates a notification and forwards the notification to the<br>
second remote MS 672. At this point the second user is aware of the loss of the first<br>
MS and does not continue listening to dead air.<br>
[0089] In step 1026, the first RAN issues a clear request to the first local MSC<br>
636. In step 1030, the first MSC returns a clear command. In step 1032, the first<br>
local MSC 636 generates an ISUP request to release the communication channel to<br>
the PSTN 650. The PSTN forwards the ISUP release request in step 1034 to the<br>
second remote MSC 660. In step 1036, the second MSC forwards a clear command<br>
to the second remote RAN 662. In step 1040, the second RAN issues a release<br>
command to the second MS 672 to release the wireless link 670. In step 1042, the<br>
second MS returns a confirmation of the release order. In step 1044, the second RAN<br>
forwards a clear complete notification to the second MSC.<br>
[0090] The embodiment of process 1010 avoids the delays associated with the<br>
generation of the clear request and clear commands between the first RAN and first<br>
MSC, steps 1026 and 1030, respectively. Therefore, in some implementations, the<br>
process 1010 can be implemented to further reduce the amount of time the second<br>
user might listen to the lost link.<br>
[0091] The present embodiments advantageously improve the average user's<br>
experience and/or allows for increased network capacity. The notification to the users<br>
of lost connections reduces users' frustration levels, and improves user experience.<br>
Further, because of the reduced frustration levels, users are more likely to tolerate<br>
increased numbers of lost connections. As a result, some systems according to the<br>
present embodiments increase the system capacity while still maintaining user<br>
satisfaction levels. For example, in some implementations systems can carry ~1. lx<br>
more load when users tolerate about -1% more lost connections (e.g., from 2% to 3%<br>
lost connections).<br>
[0092] Additionally, because the system detects the lost connection, some<br>
embodiments terminate the use of system resources in reduce time. The releasing of<br><br>
system resources frees up these resources for other connections, allowing for an<br>
increase in system capacity.<br>
[0093] FIG. 11 depicts a simplified flow diagram of a process 1110 for use in<br>
determining whether a system or network is implementing the present embodiments<br>
to detect wireless link loss and to notify one or more other users of the loss. In step<br>
1120, a communication is initiated between a first wireless device and at least a<br>
second device (wireless or wired). The communication can be dispatch<br>
communication (e.g., PPT, voice-over-IP and other such dispatch communications) or<br>
a voice communication (e.g., cellular voice call). In step 1122, the process causes the<br>
wireless communication link with the first device to be lost. For example, the signal<br>
path can be obstructed, the wireless device can be moved into an RF loss, power to<br>
the wireless device can be disconnected (battery loss), and/or other such induced<br>
connection losses.<br>
[0094] In step 1124, the commands and/or communications to the second<br>
communication device are monitored. In step 1126, it is determined if the second<br>
device receives a notification of loss. If the notification is not detected the process<br>
terminates. In some implementations, if the notification is not detected the process<br>
optionally proceeds to step 1132. If the notification is detected, step 1130 is entered<br>
where the process identifies the system as employing the present embodiments.<br>
[0095] In some embodiments, optional step 1132 is included, where it is<br>
determined if the system generates a connection release order for the second<br>
communication device. If the release order is not received, the process terminates. If<br>
a release order is received, the process identifies the system as employing the present<br>
embodiments. In some embodiments, the detection of the connection release order is<br>
to be received within a predefined period for the process to indicate the system is<br>
employing the present embodiment.<br>
[0096] In some embodiments, the process 1110 can further initiate a second<br>
communication between the first and second devices. The communication can then,<br>
be terminated through normal termination from the first device (e.g., first device<br>
performs a normal hang-up). The process can then monitor the second<br><br>
communication device to determine if the termination is different and/or if the second<br>
device receives a notification.<br>
[0097] In some present embodiments, a notification can additionally be<br>
forwarded to one or more users when another user loses a connection or purposely<br>
disconnects (e.g., hangs up). The notification when a user purposely disconnects can<br>
be a different notification than the notification forwarded when a lost connection is<br>
detected. For example, the notification of an intentional disconnect can be a different<br>
tone, a different voice message, different text message display, and/or other such<br>
notifications or combinations of notifications.<br>
[0098] The increased capacity further allows system and/or communication<br>
service providers with potential increased revenue. Increasing the system capacity<br>
may result in increased lost connections. The potential lost billable minutes due to the<br>
early notification and release of resources provided by the present embodiments is<br>
minimal compared with the gains achieved through increased system capacity and/or<br>
user satisfaction that potentially results in increased customers. For example, if a<br>
system capacity providing batch communication (e.g., PTT communications) is<br>
increased by 25%, the increase in lost or dropped connections may be about 2%. The<br>
average length of time for a PTT transmission is about ~5 seconds. As discussed<br>
above, the notification to the party not lost reduces user time on the system by about 3<br>
seconds, resulting in a 3 second loss of billing time per lost connection. This 3 second<br>
lost billing equates to only about a 1% loss of revenue ((2%* ~3)/5 =~1%).<br>
Alternatively, the present embodiments allow for, in some implementations, a 25%<br>
increase in system capacity. Thus, the 25% increase in system capacity is much<br>
greater than the loss of about 1% billable minutes.<br>
[0099] While the invention herein disclosed has been described by means of<br>

variations could be made thereto by those skilled in the art without departing from the<br>

ABSTRACT<br><br><br>
METHOD AND SYSTEM FOR USE IN REDUCING COST<br>
ASSOCIATED WITH LOST CONNECTIONS IN<br>
WIRELESS COMMUNICATION<br>
The present embodiments provides for notifying a remote communication<br>
device (124/126) when a local wireless device (122) loses its wireless link (112). A<br>
method detects when a wireless connection (112) is lost with a first communication<br>
device (122) identifies a second communication device (124, 126) that is<br>
communicating with the first device, and notifies the second device of the lost link.<br>
The notification of the lost link is supplied while the method provides batch<br>
communications. Voice communications, where a remote device is notified when a<br>
local device loses its wireless connection, can be provided. The second device can be<br>
determined by querying a server (150). The notifying can include forwarding an in-<br>
band tone, and/or generating a real time protocol packet. The loss of the link is<br>
detected through a radio access network (134), a packet control function (132), and/or<br>
a mobile switching center (136).</td>
