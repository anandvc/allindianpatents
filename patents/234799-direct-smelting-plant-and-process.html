THE FOLLOWING SPECIFICATION PARTICULARLY DESCRIBES THE INVENTION AND THE MANNER IN WHICH IT IS TO BE PERFORMED.<br><br>
DIRECT SMELTING PLANT AND PROCESS TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a direct smelting plant and a direct smelting process for producing molten metal from a metalliferous feed material, such as ores, partly reduced ores, and metal-containing waste streams.<br>
The term "smelting" is herein understood to mean thermal processing wherein chemical reactions that reduce metalliferous feed material take place to produce molten metal.<br>
In general terms the present invention relates to a direct smelting plant that includes a direct smelting vessel for smelting metalliferous feed material to metal, a pretreatment unit for pretreating metalliferous feed material and producing pretreated metalliferous feed material having a temperature of at least 200°C for smelting in the vessel, and a metalliferous feed material transfer apparatus for storing pretreated metalliferous feed material having a temperature of at least 200°C and transferring hot pretreated metalliferous feed material, i.e. feed material at a temperature of at least 200*C under pressure to solids delivery means of the direct smelting vessel.<br>
In general terms the present invention also relates to a direct smelting process for producing molten metal from a metalliferous feed material in such a direct smelting plant.<br>
The present invention relates particularly, although by no means exclusively, to metalliferous feed material in the form of iron-containing feed material, such as iron ore fines.<br>
2<br><br>
A known direct smelting process for producing molten metal, which relies principally on a molten bath as a reaction medium, and is generally referred to as the HIsmelt process, is described in International Application PCT/AU96/00197 (WO 96/31627) and other patent applications, such as the more recently filed Australian provisional application 2003901693 (which focuses on producing molten iron from iron ore fines), in the name of Technological Resources Pty. Limited.<br>
The HIsmelt process includes the steps of:<br>
(a)	forming a bath of molten metal and slag in a direct smelting vessel;<br>
(b)	injecting into the bath:<br>
(i) a metalliferous feed material, typically metal oxides; and<br>
(ii) a solid carbonaceous material, typically coal, which acts as a reductant of the metalliferous feed material and a source of energy; and<br>
(c)	smelting metalliferous feed material to metal in the bath.<br>
In the HIsmelt process the metalliferous feed material and solid carbonaceous material are injected into the molten bath through solids delivery means in the form of lances which are inclined to the vertical so as to extend downwardly and inwardly through the side wall of the direct smelting vessel and into a lower region of the vessel so as to deliver at least part of the solids material into the metal layer in the bottom of the vessel.<br>
The HIsmelt process enables large quantities of molten metal to be produced by direct smelting in a single compact vessel.<br>
3<br><br>
The Hismelt process is particularly applicable for smelting iron-containing feed material in the form of iron ore fines.<br>
One possible type of plant configuration for operating the Hismelt process, and other molten bath-based direct smelting processes, includes a pretreatment unit for pretreating metalliferous feed material prior to supplying the material to a direct smelting vessel. The pretreatment may be confined to preheating metalliferous feed material. The pretreatment may include at least partially reducing feed material in a solid state. By way of further example, the pretreatment may include roasting feed material.<br>
The present invention provides an effective and reliable plant that can pretreat metalliferous feed material and produce a pretreated feed material at a temperature of at least 200°C and transfer hot pretreated metalliferous feed material to solids delivery means of a direct smelting vessel during a direct smelting campaign.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
The following description of a preferred embodiment of a direct smelting plant and process in accordance with the present invention is in the context of smelting iron ore fines. It is noted that the present invention is not limited to iron-bearing material in this form and extends to iron-bearing materials in other forms and is not limited to iron-bearing material per se and extend to metalliferous feed materials in general.<br>
With reference to Fig. 1, insofar as the present embodiment is concerned, the main components of the direct smelting plant are:<br>
(a)    a pretreatment unit in the form of a preheater 3 for preheating iron-containing feed material in the form of iron ore fines;<br>
15<br><br>
(b)	a direct smelting vessel 5 for smelting the preheated iron ore fines to molten iron; and<br>
(c)	a hot iron-containing feed material transfer apparatus generally identified by the numeral 7 for storing preheated iron ore fines and transferring the fines under pressure to solids injection lances of the direct smelting vessel.<br>
The preheater 3 may be any suitable preheater, such as a shaft furnace or a circulating fluidised bed that can preheat iron ore fines, typically to a temperature of the order of 680°C.<br>
The direct smelting vessel 5 may be any suitable vessel for carrying out a direct smelting process, such as the Hlsmelt process described above.<br>
Australian provisional application 2003901693 in the name of the applicant includes a description of the general construction of a Hlsmelt vessel and the disclosure in the Australian provisional application is incorporated herein by cross-reference.<br>
In basic terms, the Hlsmelt vessel described in Australian provisional application 2003901693 includes a hearth that incudes a base and sides formed from refractory bricks, side walls which form a generally cylindrical barrel extending upwardly from the sides of the hearth and include an upper barrel section and a lower barrel section formed from water-cooled panels, a roof, an outlet for offgases, a forehearth for discharging molten metal continuously, and a tap-hole for discharging molten slag.<br>
In use, the vessel contains a molten bath of iron and slag which includes a layer of molten metal and a layer of molten slag on the metal layer.<br>
16<br><br>
The vessel is fitted with a downwardly extending gas injection lance for delivering a hot air blast into an upper region of the vessel. The gas injection lance receives an oxygen-enriched hot air flow through a hot gas delivery duct which extends from a hot gas supply station located some distance away from th$ reduction vessel.<br>
The vessel is also fitted with eight solids injection lances extending downwardly and inwardly through the side walls and into the slag layer of the molten bath for injecting preheated iron ore fines, solid carbonaceous material, and fluxes entrained in an oxygen-deficient carrier gas into the metal layer. The positions of the solids injection lances are selected so that their outlet ends are above the surface of the metal layer during operation of the process. These positions of the solids injection lances reduce the risk of damage through contact with molten metal and also makes it possible to cool the lances by forced internal water cooling without significant risk of water coming into contact with the molten metal in the vessel.<br>
The solids injection lances are in 2 groups of 4 lances, with the lances in one group receiving preheated hot iron ore fines and the lances (not shown) in the other group receiving coai and flux (via a carbonaceous material/flux injection system - not shown) during a smelting operation. The lances in the 2 groups are arranged alternately around the circumference of the vessel. The lances receiving preheated hot iron ore fines are identified by the numeral 27 in Fig. 4.<br>
The hot iron-containing feed material transfer apparatus 7 includes;<br>
(a)  a hot feed material storage means for storing preheated iron ore fines under pressure generally identified by the numeral 61;<br>
17<br><br>
(b)	a series of hot feed material transfer lines 11 (only one of which is shown in the flowsheet of Fig. 1) for transferring preheated iron ore fines under pressure from the storage means 61 to solids injection lances;<br>
(c)	a source of N2 gas 13 and N2 gas lines 15 for supplying N2 gas to pressurise the storage means 61 and to transport pretreated iron ore fines along the transfer lines 11; and<br>
(d)	a return line 17 for returning preheated iron ore fines to the preheater 3 in situations in which the direct smelting vessel 5 is on stand by and does not require any iron ore fines - this is an important feature from a safety perspective when operating a direct smelting plant with preheated or other forms of pre-treated feed materials as it allows for containment of such materials to the pre-treatment unit, the return line 17 or the transfer line 11 in the event of a blockage or idle operation of the smelting vessel 5. The return line 17 also allows for commissioning and testing of the transfer lines 11 and the storage means 61 without the need to operate or pass feed material to the smelting vessel 5.<br>
Figures 2 to 4 illustrate one particular embodiment of a plant layout shown in Fig. 1.<br>
The storage means 61 includes a series of storage vessels 21, 23, 25 capable of storing preheated iron ore fines under pressure and screw conveyors 39 for controlling the flow of preheated iron ore fines from the storage means 61 into the transfer lines 11.<br>
18<br><br>
Fig. 2 illustrates the relative locations of the preheater 3, the direct smelting vessel 5, and the storage means 61 as the apices of a triangle.<br>
The preheater 3 includes a pan conveyor 71 (Figure 3) that transfers preheated iron ore from the preheater, which is preferably a circulating fluidised bed, to the storage vessels 9.<br>
Fig. 2 also illustrates the arrangement of the transfer lines 11 for transferring preheated iron ore fines from the storage means 61 to the solids injection lances of the direct smelting vessel 5 and the arrangement of the return lines 17 for returning preheated iron ore fines to the preheater 3.<br>
The storage means 61 of the hot iron-containing feed material transfer apparatus 7 is divided into 2 groups 9a and 9b, with one group being connected via a transfer line 11 to one pair of solids injection lances 27 and the other group being connected via another transfer line 11 to the other pair of solids injection lances 27.<br>
As can best be seen in Fig. 3, each group 9a, 9b of the storage means 61 includes 3 vertically aligned vessels 21, 23, 25. The vessels 23 are hoppers that are arranged to receive preheated iron ore fines discharged from the pan conveyor of the preheater and supplied via a flow splitter 29 to the inlets in the upper ends of the hoppers. The vessels 23 and 25 are upper and lower lock hoppers, respectively, that are arranged to store preheated iron ore fines under pressure.<br>
The outlets of the hoppers 21 are connected to the respective iniets in the upper ends of the upper lock hoppers 23 via transfer lines 31a. The outlets of the upper lock hoppers 23 are connected to the respective inlets in the upper ends of the lower lock hoppers 25 via transfer lines 31 b. Flow of preheated iron ore<br>
19<br><br>
fines through the transfer lines 31a, 31b is controlled by valves 33a, 33b in the lines.<br>
A pressure balancing line (not shown) also interconnects the upper and lower lock hoppers 23, 25 in each group. Gas flow through the pressure balancing lines is controlled by flow control valves (not shown).<br>
Each group 9a, 9b of the storage means 61 also includes one of the screw conveyors 39, with the outlet of the lower lock hopper 25 being connected to a preheated iron ore fines inlet in the screw conveyor 39 via a transfer line 41.<br>
In use, a fill sequence for one of the groups 9a, 9b of storage vessels 9 includes the following steps:<br>
with the lower lock hopper 25 closed, open valve 33a and allow preheated iron ore fines to flow downwardly by gravity feed from hopper 21 and into the upper lock hopper 23 and fill the upper lock hopper 23;<br>
when the preheated iron ore fines reach a predetermined level in the upper lock hopper 23, close the valve 33a and pressurise the upper lock hopper 23 to the same pressure as the pressureTn the lower lock hopper 25, typically 4 bar absolute, by N2 gas supplied from the N2 gas source 13 via line 15;<br>
when the required pressure is reached, open valve 33b and the valve in the balancing line (not shown) between the upper and lower lock hoppers 23, 25 and allow preheated iron ore fines to flow downwardly by gravity feed from the upper lock hopper 23 into the lower lock hopper 25; and<br>
20-<br><br>
when the preheated iron ore fines reach a predetermined level in the lower lock hopper 23, close the valve 33b.<br>
The pressure in the upper and lower lock hoppers 23, 25 is maintained at a target pressure, typically 4 bar absolute, by N2 gas supplied from the N2 gas source 13 via line 15 (Figures 1 and 4).<br>
During the above-described filling sequence, the line 41 between the lower lock hopper 25 and the screw conveyor 39 remains open and preheated iron ore fines flow continuously downwardly from the lower lock hopper 25 into the screw conveyor 39 and are transported along the screw conveyor 39 at a predetermined mass flow rate and are supplied via an outlet line 43 to the transfer line 11 that connects the screw conveyor 39 to the pair of solids injection lances 27 at the ends of that transfer line 11.<br>
The arrangement of the transfer lines 11 and the return line 17 can best be seen in Figures 2 and 4.<br>
With reference to these Figures, as is indicated above, the storage means 61 of the hot iron-containing feed material transfer apparatus 7 is divided into 2 groups 9a and 9b, with one group being connected via a transfer line 11 to one pair of solids injection lances 27 and the other group being connected via another transfer line 11 to the other pair of solids injection lances 27. In use. preheated iron ore fines are supplied via the screw conveyors 39 to the inlet ends 45 of the transfer lines 11. N2 gas under pressure and at ambient temperature is also supplied to the inlet ends 45 of the transfer lines 11 from the N2 gas source 13 via lines 47 and picks up and transports the preheated iron ore fines along the transfer lines 11 to the solids injection lances 27.<br>
21<br><br>
Each transfer line 11 branches into two sub-branches 11a, 11b in the region of the direct smelting vessel 5 and the branch lines supply preheated iron ore fines to a diametrically opposed pair of solids injection lances 27.<br>
The return line 17 for each transfer line 11 extends from the transfer line 11 to the preheater 3. The return lines 17 include appropriately located isolation valves A for controlling flow of preheated iron ore fines into the return lines 17.<br>
The hot iron-containing feed material transfer apparatus 7 also includes a means for controlling the flow of preheated iron ore fines along the transfer lines 11 from the storage means 61 to the solids injection lances 27.<br>
The flow control means includes flow control valves 57 in the gas lines 47 that interconnect the N2 gas source 13 and the inlet ends 45 of the transfer lines 11 and a series of flow detectors (not shown) along the lines 11 and on the solids injection lances 27.<br>
One of the drivers for selecting, the flow rate of N2 gas into the transfer lines 11 is to maintain a sufficient velocity in the lines to suspend the preheated iron ore fines in the gas and carry the fines along with the gas. It is preferable to minimise the flow velocity to the extent possible, while ensuring that the velocity is sufficient to carry the fines, because wear of the transfer lines increases as the velocity increases.<br>
Another of the drivers for selecting the flow rate of N2 gas into the transfer lines 11 is to deliver the preheated iron ore fines at a sufficient velocity so that the tip velocity of the gas conveying the injected solids from the solids injection lances 27 into ihe direct smelting vessel 5 is of the range 70-120 m/s.<br>
22<br><br>
In any given situation, the actual flow rates of N2 gas and preheated iron ore fines supplied to the transfer lines 11 will be a function of a range of variables including the particle size distribution of the iron ore fines, temperatures of the N2 gas and the iron ore fines, and target tip velocities for the solids injection lances 27 of the N2 gas. In one particular embodiment modeled by the applicants the target pickup velocity of the N2 gas is 19 m/s and the target tip velocity is 112 m/s and each group 9a, 9b of storage means 61 supplies 123 tph preheated iron ore fines (at 680°C) to the associated transfer line 11 and the N2 gas 13 supplies 3,100 Nm3/hr N2 gas at 20°C to the transfer line 11.<br>
The hot iron: containing feed material transfer apparatus 7 also includes a means for unblocking the transfer lines 11.<br>
The unblocking means includes a series of appropriately located N2 gas injection connections 55 along the length of the transfer lines 11, a series of appropriately located isolation valves B, D, and G in the transfer lines 11, isolation valves E in the lines 43 between the screw conveyors 43 and the transfer lines 11, the return lines 17, discharge lines 53 at the inlet ends 45 of the transfer lines 11, isolation valves A in the return lines 17, isolation valves C in the N2 gas injection connections 55 near the solids injection lances 27, and isolation valves F in the discharge lines 53.<br>
The N2 gas injection connections 55 and the isolation valves A, B, D, E, F. and 0 enable N2 gas to be selectively supplied to different locations along the lengths of the transfer lines 11 to selectively pressurise and depressurise the lines upstream and/or downstream of locations of blockages in the transfer lines 11. The return lines 17 and the discharge lines 53 facilitate discharge of dislodged material from the transfer lines 11 as a consequence of an unblocking operation.<br>
23<br><br>
In a situation in which there is a blockage in location "X" in one of the transfer lines 11, the following sequence of operations is used to unblock the line by pressurising the line upstream of the blockage and thereafter depressurising the line downstream of the blockage:<br>
close valves E, F, B, A, and G;<br>
open valves C in the N2 gas injection connections 55 near the sofids injection lances 27 to provide an N2 purge through the lances 27 to maintain a positive pressure in the lances 27;<br>
open valve D at the inlet end of the transfer line 11 and thereby allow N2 gas from the N2 gas source 13 to build up pressure upstream of the blockage X;<br>
open valve A in the return line 17 and thereby suddenly reduce the pressure in the transfer line 11 downstream of the blockage X, with a view to dislodging the blockage and transferring dislodged material along the return line 17; and<br>
thereafter reset the valves to normal operation settings to resume supply of preheated iron ore fines to the solids injection lances 27.<br>
The above sequence of steps may be repeated.<br>
In operation, valve C may be opened first before any of valves E, F, 8, A and G are closed. This is to provide a continuous gas flow through the lance independent of the position of any of these valves. Valve H may be used as an alternative to valve A.<br>
24<br><br>
In a situation in which there is a blockage in location "X" in one of the transfer lines 11, the following sequence of operations is used to unblock the line by pressurising the line downstream of the blockage and thereafter depressurising the line upstream of the blockage:<br>
close valves B, A, F, D and E;<br>
open valves C in the N2 gas injection connections 55 near the solids injection lances 27 to provide an N2 purge through the lances 27 to maintain a positive pressure in the lances 27;<br>
open valves G in the branch lines 11a, 11b and thereby allow N2 gas to build up pressure downstream of the blockage X;<br>
open valve F in the discharge line 53 and thereby suddenly reduce the pressure in the transfer line upstream of the blockage X, with a view to dislodging the blockage and transferring dislodged material along the discharge line 53; and<br>
thereafter reset valves to normal operation settings to resume supply of preheated hun ore fines to the solids injection lances 27.<br>
The above sequence of steps may be repeated.<br>
In both of the above sequences of operations the key feature is to pressurise and depressurise the sections of the transfer line 11 upstream and downstream of the blockage.<br>
The above-described plant is capable of supplying hot iron-containing feed material to the direct smelting vessel for different operating conditions, including<br>
25<br><br>
unexpected perturbations, at different stages of a smelting campaign. It is capable of handling situations in which it is necessary to stop supplying hot iron-containing feed material altogether to the direct smelting vessel. In addition, the apparatus is capable of operating reliably in long-term smelting campaigns, and a key aspect of this requirement is that it is capable of unblocking hot iron-containing feed material transfer lines without manual intervention on the lines or plant shutdown.<br>
Many modifications may be made to the embodiment of the present invention described above without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.<br>
