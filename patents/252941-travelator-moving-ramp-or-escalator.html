needs to be made in the fixed base for the travelator machinery. In the following description of an example, the invention is described with reference to a horizontal travelator, but it is obvious that corresponding principles of the invention can also be applied to moving ramps and escalators.<br>
The travelator comprises a conveyor 1, which may be e.g. a pallet conveyor or a belt conveyor, which is supported on a frame 2. The entire length of the frame 2 rests on a floor base. As shown in Fig. 2, the frame 2 comprises two elongated frame parts 4, 5, which are connected together by a number of transverse cross members 7 extending transversely between the frame parts 4, 5 to hold them parallel to each other at a distance from each other. The frame parts 4, 5 are composed of mutually identical profiled metallic bodies 3 joined together end to end one after the other, which contain guide elements 6 integrated in one profile of solid material for guiding the coupling, supporting and/or moving parts of the conveyor, as will be described later on with reference to Fig. 3 and 4.<br>
As is further shown in Fig. 1 and 2, the travelator comprises two handrails 12, one on either side of the conveyor 1. The handrails 12 comprise a handrail frame 13, which is secured to the profiled metallic bodies 3 serving as frame parts 4, 5. Mounted on the handrail frame 13 is an endless handrail belt 14, which has been arranged as a loop having an upper handhold portion 15 that the passenger can grip with a hand for support and a lower return portion 16 disposed inside the frame part 4, 5.<br>
Fig. 3 is a diagrammatic view of one side of the conveyor 1. The other side, which is not shown in the figures, is identical but reversed like a mirror im-<br><br>
WO 2005/070809	PCT/FI2004/000814<br>

age. It can be seen from the figure that the conveyor 1 is a pallet conveyor comprising a number of pallets 8 arranged one after the other. In this case, the drive element 9 used to move the pallets is a link chain, to which the pallets 8 are secured to move them. The drive element 9 has been implemented as an endless loop, which extends perpendicularly to the plane of the figure and of which the figure shows the upper portion 10 and the lower portion 11. The pallet 8 shown at a higher level is a pallet moving in the transport direction. The pallet 8 shown at a lower level is a pallet moving in the opposite direction, returning to the beginning of the conveyor track.<br>
The profiled metallic body 3, of which the frame parts 4 and 5 are composed, consists of a profile extruded from a light metal, preferably aluminum or an aluminum alloy, containing many functions integrated in one body. The low construction is exemplified by the fact that in one embodiment the height of the profile is about 34 cm.<br>
As shown in Fig. 3, the handrail belt 14 is supported by suspenders 17, one of which is seen in the figure, which are fastened to the profiled metallic body 3 at a distance from each other to support the return portion 16 of the handrail belt 14. The handrail belt 14 is a substantially C-shaped profile in cross-section such that it defines inside it an interior groove 18 which, in the return portion 16 of the handrail belt, opens upwards. At the edges of the interior groove 18 are edge flanges 19 directed towards each other, with a gap 20 between them.<br>
It can be seen from the Fig. 3 that the web 21 of the suspender 17 extends through the gap 2 0 of the handrail belt into the interior groove 18. The suspension<br><br>
WO 2005/070809	PCT/FI2004/000814<br>
9<br>
flanges 22 extend under the edge flanges 22 on either side of the web 21, thus supporting the handrail belt 14.<br>
From Fig. 5 and 6 we can see that the suspender 17 comprises a vertical mounting flange whereby the suspender 17 can be fastened with a screw joint to the profiled body 3. The mounting flange has three snap-on coupling elements 23 formed on it for the attachment of conductors. The suspender 17 is preferably a single solid piece extruded from plastic. To allow the handrail belt to slide with low friction on the suspenders, the suspender 17 is formed from a plastic material having a substantially low friction coefficient. Similarly, the contact surfaces 24 of the edge flanges 19 of the handrail belt 14 that come into contact with the suspension flanges 22 may be coated with a material having a substantially low friction coefficient.<br>
As can be seen from Fig. 3 and 4, integrated in the single profiled metallic body of solid material is a wall 25 forming the outwardly visible outer surface of the frame part 4, 5 and a bottom 26 fitted to be resting against a fixed base. Further, the profiled body 3 has first stop faces 27, 28 for forming a guide track 6 for supporting and guiding the pallets 8. The upper stop face 27 supports the wheels of loaded pallets 8. The whole or part of the length of the upper stop face 27 can be covered with a wearing plate 43, such as a sheet steel plate, which can be fastened in place in a groove 44 formed in the profiled metallic body. Such a sheet steel plate 43 is preferably provided at least at the joints between profiled metallic bodies 3 to eliminate any discontinuities of the stop face that may arise due to inaccurate alignment. Further, integrated in the profiled metallic body 3 are second stop faces 29, 30, which are a horizontal stop face 29, on<br><br>
WO 2005/070809	PCT/FI2004/000814<br>
10<br>
which the edge of the handrail frame plate 13 can be supported, and a vertical stop face 30, against which the edge of the handrail frame plate 13 can be rested. Formed in the profiled body 3 is also a mounting slot<br>
31	for a retaining bolt 32 used to secure the handrail<br>
frame 13, which slot can receive the head of the bolt<br>
32	inside it. The profiled metallic body 3 further has<br>
a groove integrated in it as a coupling element 33 for<br>
fastening the suspender 17. In addition, it has a sec<br>
ond coupling element 34 for joining a second profiled<br>
body 35 forming an interior wall to the profiled me<br>
tallic body 3 from a lateral direction. Further, the<br>
profiled metallic body 3 contains a first space 36,<br>
which has been fitted to receive the return portion 16<br>
of the handrail belt 14 inside it. Moreover, the pro<br>
filed metallic body 3 contains a second space 37,<br>
which has been fitted to receive the upper portion 10<br>
of the drive element 9 inside it. A third space 38 has<br>
been fitted to receive the lower portion 11 of the<br>
drive element 9 inside it. Furthermore, the profiled<br>
metallic body 3 contains three fourth spaces 39, which<br>
have been fitted to receive inside them a bar-like ex<br>
tension joint element 40 for joining the profiled me<br>
tallic bodies 3 end to end one after the other. In ad<br>
dition, the profiled metallic body 3 contains three<br>
fifth spaces 41, which have been fitted to receive in<br>
side them round alignment pins 42, by means of which<br>
the profiled metallic bodies  3  can be accurately<br>
aligned relative to each other.<br>
The invention is not limited to the embodiment examples described above; instead, many variations are possible within the scope of the inventive concept defined in the claims.<br><br>
