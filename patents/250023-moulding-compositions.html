				<td>Polvamide moulding compositions with improved flowabilitv<br>
This invention relates to moulding compositions based on at least one semicrystalline thermoplastic<br>
polyamide and on at least one copolymer composed of at least one olefin, preferably of one a-olefin,<br>
with at least one methacrylic ester or acrylic ester of an aliphatic alcohol having from 1 to 4 carbon<br>
atoms, the MFI (melt flow index) of the copolymer being not less than 50 g/10 min, and to a process<br>
for preparation of these moulding compositions, and also to the use of these moulding compositions<br>
for production of mouldings or of semifinished products via injection moulding or extrusion.<br>
Highly flowable thermoplastic compositions are of interest for a wide variety of injection moulding<br>
applications. By way of example, thin-walled components in the electrical, electronics and motor<br>
vehicle industry require low viscosities from the thermoplastics composition in order to permit<br>
material to be charged to the mould with minimum injection pressures and, respectively, clamping<br>
forces in the appropriate injection moulding machines. This also applies to simultaneous charging of<br>
material to two or more injection moulding components by way of a shared runner system in what<br>
are known as multicavity tooling systems. Shorter cycle times can moreover often be achieved using<br>
low-viscosity thermoplastic compositions. Good flowabilities are also specifically very important for<br>
highly filled thermoplastic compositions, e.g. with glass fibre and/or mineral contents above 40% by<br>
weight.<br>
However, although the thermoplastic compositions have high flowability, the actual components<br>
produced therefrom are subjected to stringent mechanical requirements, and the lowering of viscosity<br>
cannot therefore be permitted to cause significant impairment of mechanical properties.<br>
There are a number of ways of obtaining highly flowable, low-viscosity thermoplastic moulding<br>
compositions.<br>
One way uses low-viscosity polymer resins with very low molecular weight as base polymers for the<br>
thermoplastic moulding compositions. However, the use of low-molecular-weight polymer resins is<br>
often associated with sacrifices in mechanical properties, in particular toughness. Preparation of a<br>
low-viscosity polymer resin in an existing polymerization plant moreover often requires complicated<br>
intervention attended by capital expenditure.<br>
Another way uses what are known as flow aids, also termed flow agents or flow assistants or<br>
internal lubricants, which can be added as an additive to the polymer resin.<br>
These flow aids are known from the literature, e.g. in Kunststoffe 2000, 9, p. 116-118, and by way<br>
of example can be fatty acid esters of polyols, or amides derived from fatty acids and from amines.<br>
However, these fatty acid esters, such as pentaerythritol tetrastearate or ethylene glycol<br>
dimontanoate, have only limited miscibility with polar thermoplastics, such as polyamides,<br>
polyalkylene terephthalates or polycarbonates. Their concentration increases at the surface of the<br>
moulding and they are therefore also used as mould-release aids. However, on heat-ageing or else, in<br>
the case of polyamides, on absorption of moisture, particularly if concentrations are relatively high,<br>
the flow aids can migrate out of these mouldings to the surface and become concentrated there. By<br>
way of example, in coated mouldings this can lead to problems with regard to adhesion to paint or to<br>
metal.<br>
As an alternative to the surface-active flow aids, it is possible to use internal flow aids which are<br>
compatible with the polymer resins. Examples of those suitable for this purpose are low-molecularweight<br>
compounds or branched, highly branched or dendritic polymers whose polarity is similar to<br>
that of the polymer resin. These highly branched or dendritic systems are known from the literature<br>
and their basis can by way of example be branched polyesters, polyamides, polyesteramides,<br>
polyethers or polyamines, as described in Kunststoffe 2001, 91, pp. 179-190, or in Advances in<br>
Polymer Science 1999, 143 (Branched Polymers II), pp. 1-34.<br>
EP-A 0 682 057 describes the use of the nitrogen-containing first-generation 4-cascade dendrimer:<br>
l,4-diaminobutane[4]propylamine (N,N'-tetrabis(3-aminopropyl)-l,4-butanediamine) DAB(PA)4 to<br>
lower viscosity in nylon-6, nylon-6,6 and polybutylene terephthalate (PBT). While use of DAB(PA)4<br>
to lower viscosity in polyamides has practically no effect on the impact resistance of the resultant<br>
moulding compositions (difference 
PBT.<br>
WO-A 95/06081 (= US 5 493 000) describes the use of three-dimensional branched polymers having<br>
rigid aromatic units in blends with polyamide in order to increase the stiffness of the material and the<br>
ultimate tensile strength, with simultaneous reduction in viscosity and in the tensile strain at break of<br>
the blends.<br>
EP-A 0 994 157 (= AU 6 233 499 A) describes the use of highly branched polymers which are based<br>
on aromatics and which are added during caprolactam polycondensation and are therefore<br>
copolymerized. Compositions composed of polyamides in which highly branched polymers have been<br>
copolymerized exhibit better mechanical properties and better flowabilities here than comparative<br>
compositions without the highly branched components. Addition of the highly branched polymers<br>
during the polymerization reaction is described, but no addition to a polymer melt is described.<br>
In principle, improvements in the flowability of polyamides can also be achieved via addition of<br>
phenols, of bisphenols, and of similar low-molecular-weight additives. EP-A 0 240 887 (= US 5<br>
212 224) describes moulding compositions composed of polyamide, of a rubber and of a bisphenol,<br>
these exhibiting improved flowability brought about via the additive.<br>
DE-A 32 48 329 (= US 4 628 069) describes addition of phenolic compounds to polyamide in order<br>
to reduce water absorption.<br>
Alongside improvement in flowability, it is often desirable to improve the toughness of the materials.<br>
For this, other copolymers which are based on ethene and on acrylic or methacrylic esters and which<br>
bring about an improvement in toughness can also be added to the thermoplastics used.<br>
DE-A 2 758 568 (= US 4 362 846) and DE-A 2 801 585 (= US 4 362 846) describe modification of<br>
the toughness of polyamides with acrylate-grafted polyolefins. It is emphasized that the use of the<br>
acrylate-modified polyolefins leads to an increase in melt viscosity.<br>
EP-A 1 191 067 (= US 6 759 480) describes modification of the toughness of thermoplastics, inter<br>
alia of polyamide and polybutylene terephthalate, via a mixture composed of a copolymer composed<br>
of ethene with an unreactive alkyl acrylate, and also of a copolymer composed of ethene with an<br>
acrylate having an additional reactive group. There is no discussion of the flowability of the<br>
moulding compositions.<br>
The object of the present invention then consisted in lowering the viscosity of polyamide<br>
polycondensate compositions by treating the polymer melt with additives, without any resultant need<br>
to accept the losses that occur when using low-viscosity linear polymer resins or when using<br>
additives disclosed in the literature in properties such as impact resistance and hydrolysis resistance.<br>
In terms of stiffness and ultimate tensile strength, the polyamide compositions should if at all<br>
possible not differ significantly from the polyamide polycondensate compositions not treated with<br>
additives, in order to permit problem-free replacement of the materials for plastic structures based on<br>
polyamide.<br>
Achievement of the object and thus the subject matter of the invention is provided by polyamide<br>
moulding compositions comprising<br>
A) from 99 to 10 parts by weight, preferably from 98 to 30 parts by weight, particularly<br>
preferably from 97 to 60 parts by weight, of at least one semicrystalline thermoplastic<br>
polyamide and<br>
B) from 1 to 20 parts by weight, preferably from 2 to 15 parts by weight, particularly<br>
preferably from 3 to 9 parts by weight, of at least one copolymer composed of at least one<br>
olefin, preferably of one a-olefin, with at least one methacrylic ester or acrylic ester of an<br>
aliphatic alcohol having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms, the MFI of the copolymer B) being not<br>
less than 50 g/10 min, and preferably being from 80 to 900 g/10 min.<br>
For the purposes of the present invention, MFI (melt flow index) has always been measured or<br>
determined at 190°C and with a test load of 2.16 kg.<br>
Surprisingly, it has been found that mixtures composed of at least one semicrystalline thermoplastic<br>
polyamide with copolymers of olefins with methacrylic esters or with acrylic esters of aliphatic<br>
alcohols having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms, their MFI being not less than 50 g/10 min, lead to the<br>
desired lowering of the melt viscosity of the inventive moulding compositions prepared therefrom. In<br>
comparison with moulding compositions without copolymer B), the inventive moulding compositions<br>
exhibit no significant losses, and indeed instead in some cases improvements, in properties such as<br>
low-temperature impact resistance, hydrolysis resistance, density, surface quality. The moulding<br>
compositions have excellent suitability for use in thin-wall technology.<br>
According to the invention, the compositions comprise, as component A), at least one semicrystalline<br>
thermoplastic polyamide.<br>
The polyamides to be used according to the invention can be prepared by various processes and can<br>
be synthesized from very different units, and, in each specific application, can be used alone or can<br>
be treated with processing aids, with stabilizers, with polymeric alloy partners (e.g. elastomers) or<br>
else with reinforcing materials (e.g. mineral fillers or glass fibres) to give materials with specifically<br>
adjusted combinations of properties. Blends with contents of other polymers, e.g. of polyethylene,<br>
polypropylene, ABS (acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene copolymer) are also suitable, and, if<br>
appropriate, one or more compatibilizers can be used. The properties of the polyamides can be<br>
improved via addition of elastomers, e.g. with regard to the impact resistance of, for example,<br>
reinforced polyamides. The wide variety of possible combinations gives access to a very large<br>
number of products with very different properties.<br>
A wide variety of procedures has been disclosed for preparation of polyamides using, as a function<br>
of the desired final product, different monomer units, a variety of chain regulators in order to set the<br>
desired molecular weight, or else monomers having reactive groups for intended subsequent posttreatments.<br>
The industrially relevant processes for preparation of polyamides mostly proceed by way of<br>
polycondensation in the melt. Hydrolytic polymerization of lactams is also polycondensation for this<br>
purpose.<br>
According to the invention, polyamides preferably to be used as component A) are semicrystalline<br>
polyamides which can be prepared starting from diamines and from dicarboxylic acids and/or from<br>
lactams having fewer than 5 ring members or from corresponding amino acids.<br>
Starting materials which can be used are aliphatic and/or aromatic dicarboxylic acids such as adipic<br>
acid, 2,2,4- and 2,4,4-trimethyladipic acid, azelaic acid, sebacic acid, isophthalic acid, terephthalic<br>
acid, aliphatic and/or aromatic diamines, e.g. tetramethylenediamine, hexamethylenediamine, 1,9-<br>
nonanediamine, 2,2,4- and 2,4,4-trimethylhexamethylenediamine, the isomeric diaminodicyclohexylmethanes,<br>
diaminodicyclohexylpropanes, bisaminomethylcyclohexane, phenylenediamines,<br>
xylylenediamines, aminocarboxylic acids, e.g. aminocaproic acid, and, respectively the<br>
corresponding lactams. Copolyamides composed of two or more of the monomers mentioned are<br>
included.<br>
According to the invention, it is particularly preferable to use caprolactams, and very particularly<br>
preferable to use s-caprolactam, or else most of the compounded materials based on PA6, on PA66 and<br>
on other aliphatic and/or aromatic polyamides and, respectively, copolyamides, where there are from<br>
3 to 11 methylene groups in these materials for each polyamide group in the polymer chain.<br>
The semicrystalline polyamides to be used according to the invention as component A) can also be<br>
used in a mixture with other polyamides and/or with other polymers.<br>
Conventional additives, e.g. mould-release agents, stabilizers and/or flow aids can be admixed with<br>
the polyamides in the melt or can be applied to their surface.<br>
The inventive compositions comprise, as component B), copolymers, preferably random copolymers,<br>
composed of at least one olefin, preferably an a-olefin, and of at least one methacrylic ester or<br>
acrylic ester of an aliphatic alcohol having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms, the MFI of the copolymer B)<br>
being not less than 50 g/10 min, and preferably being from 80 to 900 g/10 min. In one preferred<br>
embodiment, less than 4% by weight, particularly preferably less than 1.5% by weight and very<br>
particularly preferably 0% by weight of the copolymer B) is composed of monomer units which<br>
contain further reactive functional groups (selected from the group consisting of epoxides, oxetanes,<br>
anhydrides, imides, aziridines, furans, acids, amines, oxazolines).<br>
Suitable olefins, preferably a-olefins as constituent of the copolymers B) preferably have from 2 to<br>
10 carbon atoms and can be unsubstituted or have substitution by one or more aliphatic,<br>
cycloaliphatic or aromatic groups.<br>
Preferred olefins have been selected from the group consisting of ethene, propene, 1-butene,<br>
1-pentene, 1-hexene, 1-octene. 3-methyl-l-pentene. Particularly preferred olefins are ethene and<br>
propene, and ethene is very particularly preferred.<br>
Mixtures of the olefins described are also suitable.<br>
In another preferred embodiment, the further reactive functional groups (selected from the group<br>
consisting of epoxides, oxetanes, anhydrides, imides, aziridines, furans, acids, amines, oxazolines) of<br>
the copolymer B) are introduced exclusively by way of the olefins into the copolymer B).<br>
The content of the olefin in the copolymer B) is from 50 to 95% by weight, preferably from 61 to<br>
93% by weight.<br>
The copolymer B) is further defined via the second constituent alongside the olefin. A suitable<br>
second constituent is alkyl esters of acrylic acid or methacrylic acid whose alkyl group is formed by<br>
from 1 to 4 carbon atoms.<br>
By way of example, the alkyl group of the methacrylic or acrylic ester can have been selected from<br>
the group consisting of methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, sec-butyl, isobutyl, tert-butyl.<br>
The alkyl group of the methacrylic or acrylic ester is preferably selected from the group consisting of<br>
ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, sec-butyl, isobutyl, tert-butyl. Very particularly preferably, the<br>
alkyl group of the methacrylic or acrylic ester has 4 carbon atoms and comprises the n-butyl, secbutyl,<br>
isobutyl or tert-butyl group. Particular preference is given to n-butyl acrylate.<br>
According to the invention, particular preference is given to copolymers B) in which the olefin is<br>
copolymerized with butyl acrylate, in particular n-butyl acrylate.<br>
Mixtures of the acrylic or methacrylic esters described are also suitable. It is preferable here to use<br>
more than 50% by weight, particularly preferably more than 90% by weight and very particularly<br>
preferably 100% by weight, of butyl acrylate, based on the total amount of acrylic and methacrylic<br>
ester in copolymer B).<br>
In another preferred embodiment, the further reactive functional groups (selected from the group<br>
consisting of epoxides, oxetanes, anhydrides, imides, aziridines, furans, acids, amines, oxazolines) of<br>
the copolymer B) are introduced exclusively by way of acrylic or methacrylic esters into the<br>
copolymer B).<br>
The content of the acrylic or methacrylic esters in the copolymer B) is preferably from 5 to 50% by<br>
weight, particularly preferably from 7 to 39% by weight.<br>
A feature of suitable copolymers B) is not only their constitution but also their low molecular weight.<br>
Accordingly, copolymers B) suitable for the inventive moulding compositions are only those whose<br>
MFI value, measured at 190°C and with a load of 2.16 kg, is at least 50 g/10 min, preferably from<br>
80to900g/10min.<br>
Examples of suitable copolymers as component B) can have been selected from the group of the<br>
materials supplied by Arkema (formerly Atofina) with the trade mark Lotryl®, which are usually<br>
used as hot-melt adhesive.<br>
In one preferred embodiment, the inventive polyamide moulding compositions can comprise, in<br>
addition to components A) and B), one or more of the components of the series C), D), E), F) and<br>
G).<br>
In one preferred embodiment of this type, the thermoplastic polyamide moulding compositions can<br>
therefore also, if appropriate, comprise, in addition to components A) and B),<br>
C) from 0.001 to 70 parts by weight, preferably from 5 to 50 parts by weight, particularly<br>
preferably from 9 to 47 parts by weight, of at least one filler or reinforcing material.<br>
However, the filler or reinforcing material used can also comprise mixtures composed of two or<br>
more different fillers and/or reinforcing materials, for example based on talc, mica, silicate, quartz,<br>
titanium dioxide, wollastonite, kaolin, amorphous silicas, magnesium carbonate, chalk, feldspar,<br>
barium sulfate, glass beads and/or fibrous fillers and/or reinforcing materials based on carbon fibres<br>
and/or glass fibres. It is preferable to use mineral particulate fillers based on talc, mica, silicate,<br>
quartz, titanium dioxide, wollastonite, kaolin, amorphous silicas, magnesium carbonate, chalk,<br>
feldspar, barium sulfate and/or glass fibres. It is particularly preferable to use mineral particulate<br>
fillers based on talc, wollastonite, kaolin and/or glass fibres.<br>
Particularly for applications which demand isotropy in dimensional stability and demand high<br>
thermal dimensional stability, for example in motor vehicle applications for exterior bodywork parts,<br>
it is preferable to use mineral fillers, in particular talc, wollastonite or kaolin.<br>
A further particular preference is also the use of acicular mineral fillers, according to the invention,<br>
acicular mineral fillers are a mineral filler with highly pronounced acicular character. An example<br>
which may be mentioned is acicular wollastonites. The lengtkdiameter ratio of the material is<br>
preferably from 2:1 to 35:1, particularly preferably from 3:1 to 19:1, most preferably from 4:1 to<br>
12:1. The average particle size of the inventive acicular minerals is preferably smaller than 20 urn,<br>
particularly preferably smaller than 15 (im, with particular preference smaller than 10 um,<br>
determined using a CILAS GRANULOMETER.<br>
As previously described above, the filler and/or reinforcing material may, if appropriate, have been<br>
surface-modified, for example using a coupling agent or coupling agent system, e.g. based on silane.<br>
However, the pretreatment is not absolutely essential. In particular when glass fibres are used,<br>
polymer dispersions, film-formers, branching agents and/or glass fibre processing aids can also be<br>
used in addition to silanes.<br>
The glass fibres to be used with particular preference according to the invention whose fibre<br>
diameter is generally from 7 to 18 um, preferably from 9 to 15 um, are added in the form of<br>
continuous-filament fibres or in the form of chopped or ground glass fibres. The fibres can have been<br>
equipped with a suitable size system and with a coupling agent or coupling agent system, e.g. based<br>
on silane.<br>
Familiar coupling agents based on silane for pretreatment are silane compounds having by way of<br>
example the general formula (I)<br>
(I) (X-(CH2)q)k-Si-(0-CrH2r+1)4.k<br>
where the substituents are as follows:<br>
X: NH2-,HO-or H2c^-^c—,<br>
H<br>
q: a whole number from 2 to 10, preferably from 3 to 4,<br>
r: a whole number from 1 to 5, preferably from 1 to 2, and<br>
k: a whole number from 1 to 3, preferably 1.<br>
Preferred coupling agents are silane compounds from the group of aminopropyltrimethoxysilane,<br>
aminobutyltrimethoxysilane, aminopropyltriethoxysilane, aminobutyltriethoxysilane, and also the<br>
corresponding silanes which contain a glycidyl group as substituent X.<br>
The amounts generally used of the silane compounds for equipping the fillers are from 0.05 to 2% by<br>
weight, preferably from 0.25 to 1.5% by weight and in particular from 0.5 to 1% by weight, based<br>
on the mineral filler used for surface coating.<br>
The consequence of processing to give the moulding composition or moulding is that the d97 or d50<br>
value of the particulate fillers in the moulding composition or in the moulding can be smaller than<br>
that of the fillers initially used. A consequence of the processing to give the moulding composition or<br>
moulding is that the length distributions of the glass fibres in the moulding composition or in the<br>
moulding can be shorter than those of the material initially used.<br>
In one alternative preferred embodiment, the polyamide moulding compositions can also, if<br>
appropriate, comprise, in addition to components A) and B), and/or C),<br>
D) from 0.001 to 65 parts by weight of at least one flame retardant additive.<br>
Flame retardants that can be used in component D) are commercially available organic halogen<br>
compounds with synergists or are commercially available organic nitrogen compounds or are<br>
organic/inorganic phosphorus compounds individually or in a mixture. It is also possible to use<br>
mineral flame retardant additives such as magnesium hydroxide or Ca Mg carbonate hydrates (e.g.<br>
DE-A 4 236 122 (= CA 210 9024 Al)). It is also possible to use salts of aliphatic or of aromatic<br>
sulphonic acids. Examples which may be mentioned of halogen-containing, in particular brominated<br>
and chlorinated compounds are: ethylene-l,2-bistetrabromophthalimide, epoxidized<br>
tetrabromobisphenol A resin, tetrabromobisphenol A oligocarbonate, tetrachlorobisphenol A<br>
oligocarbonate, pentabromopolyacrylate, brominated polystyrene and decabromodiphenyl ether.<br>
Examples of suitable organophosphorus compounds are the phosphorus compounds according to<br>
WO-A 98/17720 (= US 6 538 024), e.g. triphenyl phosphate (TPP), resorcinol bis(diphenyl<br>
phosphate) (RDP) and the oligomers derived therefrom, and also bisphenol A bis(diphenyl<br>
phosphate) (BDP) and the oligomers derived therefrom, and organic and inorganic phosphonic acid<br>

monomer,<br>
E.2 from 95 to 5% by weight, preferably from 70 to 10% by weight, of one or more graft bases<br>
with glass transition temperatures 

The median particle size (dso value) of the graft base E.2 is generally from 0.05 to 10 jam, preferably<br>

Examples of particularly preferred graft bases E.2 are ABS polymers (emulsion, bulk and<br>

(measured in toluene).<br>
The elastomer modifiers or graft polymers E) are prepared via free-radical polymerization, e.g. via<br>

polymerization.<br>
Other particularly suitable graft rubbers are ABS polymers which are prepared via redox initiation<br>
using an initiator system composed of organic hydroperoxide and ascorbic acid according to US-A<br>

Because it is known that the graft monomers are not necessarily entirely grafted onto the graft base<br>

on the graft base E.2.<br>
In the case of cyclic crosslinking monomers having at least 3 ethylenically unsaturated groups, it is<br>
advantageous to restrict the amount to below 1% by weight of the graft base E.2.<br>
Examples of preferred "other" polymerizable, ethylenically unsaturated monomers which can serve<br>
alongside the acrylic esters, if appropriate, for preparation of the graft base E.2 are acrylonitrile,<br>

5th Edition, Hanser-Verlag, Munich, 2001. The additives may be used alone or in a mixture, or in<br>
the form of masterbatches.<br>
Examples of stabilizers which can be used are sterically hindered phenols, hydroquinones, aromatic<br>

The component G used preferably comprises terpolymers of the monomers mentioned. Accordingly,<br>
it is preferable to use terpolymers of styrene, acrylonitrile and maleic anhydride. In particular, these<br>
terpolymers contribute to improvement in mechanical properties, such as tensile strength and tensile<br>
strain at break. The amount of maleic anhydride in the terpolymer can vary widely. The amount is<br>
preferably from 0.2 to 5 mol%. Amounts of from 0.5 to 1.5 mol% are particularly preferred. In this<br>
range, particularly good mechanical properties are achieved in relation to tensile strength and tensile<br>
strain at break.<br>
The terpolymer can be prepared in a known manner. One suitable method is to dissolve monomer<br>
components of the terpolymer, e.g. styrene, maleic anhydride or acrylonitrile, in a suitable solvent,<br>
e.g. methyl ethyl ketone (MEK). One or, if appropriate, more chemical initiators are added to this<br>
solution. Examples of suitable initiators are peroxides. The mixture is then polymerized at elevated<br>
temperatures for a number of hours. The solvent and the unreacted monomers are then removed in a<br>
manner known per se.<br>

EP-A 0 785 234 (= US 5 756 576) and EP-A 0 202 214 (= US 4 713 415) describe examples of<br>
compatibilizers G) which can be used according to the invention. According to the invention,<br>
particular preference is given to the polymers mentioned in EP-A 0 785 234.<br>
The compatibilizers can be present in component G) alone or in any desired mixture with one<br>
another.<br>
Another substance particularly preferred as compatibilizer is a terpolymer of styrene and<br>
acyrlonitrile in a ratio of 2.1:1 by weight containing 1 mol% of maleic anhydride. Component G) is<br>

According to the invention, the following combinations of the components are preferred:<br>

A,B,D,E; A,B,D,F; A,B,D,G; A,B,E,F; A,B,E,G; A,B,F,G; A,B,C,D,E; A,B,C,D,F;<br>
A,B,C,D,G; A,B,C,E,F; A,B,C,E,G; A,B,C,F,G; A,B,E,F,G; A,B,D,E,F; A,B,D,E,G;<br>
A,B,D,F,G; A,B,C,D,E,F; A,B,C,D,E,G; A,B,C,D,F,G; A,B,D,E,F,G; A,B,C,E,F,G;<br>
A,B,C,D,E,F,G.<br>
The present invention further provides the preparation of the inventive polyamide moulding<br>
compositions. This takes place by known processes via mixing of the components in the appropriate<br>
proportions by weight. The mixing of the components preferably takes place at temperatures of from<br>
220 to 330°C by combining, mixing, kneading, extruding or rolling the components together. It can<br>
be advantageous to premix individual components. It can moreover be advantageous to produce<br>
mouldings or semifinished products directly from a physical mixture (dry blend) which has been<br>
prepared at room temperature (preferably from 0 to 40°C) and which is composed of premixed<br>
and/or individual components.<br>
The invention further provides the mouldings or semifinished products to be produced from the<br>
inventive polyamide moulding compositions comprising<br>
A) from 99 to 10 parts by weight, preferably from 98 to 30 parts by weight, particularly<br>
preferably from 97 to 60 parts by weight, of at least one semicrystalline thermoplastic<br>
polyamide and<br>
B) from 1 to 20 parts by weight, preferably from 2 to 15 parts by weight, particularly<br>
preferably from 3 to 9 parts by weight, of at least one copolymer composed of at least one<br>
olefin, preferably of one a-olefin, with at least one methacrylic ester or acrylic ester of an<br>
aliphatic alcohol having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms, the MFI being not less than 50 g/10 min<br>
and preferably being from 80 to 900 g/10 min.<br>
Further advantages surprisingly exhibited by the inventive moulding compositions in comparison<br>
with the prior art are the following:<br>
markedly improved flowability, in particular at shear rates relevant for thermoplastics<br>
processing;<br>
markedly reduced injection pressure in processing via injection moulding;<br>
improved low temperature impact resistance;<br>
lower density;<br>
improved hydrolysis resistance;<br>
improved surface quality of the mouldings.<br>
The inventive polyamide moulding compositions can be processed by conventional processes, for<br>
example via injection moulding or extrusion, to give mouldings or semifinished products. Examples<br>
of semifinished products are foils and sheets. Particular preference is given to processing via<br>
injection moulding.<br>
The mouldings or semifinished products to be produced according to the invention from the<br>
polyamide moulding compositions can be small or large parts and, by way of example, can be used<br>
in the motor vehicle, electrical, electronics, telecommunications, information technology, or computer<br>
industry, in the household, in sports, in medicine or in the entertainment industry. In particular, the<br>
inventive polyamide moulding compositions can be used for applications which require high melt<br>
flowability. An example of these applications is what is known as thin-wall technology, in which the<br>
wall thicknesses of mouldings to be produced from the moulding compositions are less than 2.5 mm,<br>
preferably less than 2.0 mm, particularly preferably less than 1.5 mm and most preferably less than<br>
1.0mm. Another example of these applications is cycle time reduction, e.g. via reduction of<br>
processing temperature. Another application example is the processing of the moulding compositions<br>
by way of what are known as multitooling systems, in which material is charged by way of a runner<br>
system to at least 4 moulds, preferably at least 8 moulds, particularly preferably at least 12 moulds,<br>
most preferably at least 16 moulds, in an injection moulding procedure.<br>
Mouldings composed of the inventive moulding compositions can also be used for parts of the<br>
cooling circulation system and/or of the oil circulation system of motor vehicles.<br>
Examples:<br>
The following were used:<br>
Nylon-6: Durethan® B29, commercially available product from Lanxess Deutschland GmbH,<br>
Leverkusen, Germany, with relative solution viscosity 2.9 (measured in m-cresol at 25°C)<br>
Glassfibre: Glassfibre sized with silane-containing compounds and with diameter 11 um (CS 7928,<br>
commercially available product from Lanxess N.V., Antwerp, Belgium)<br>
Lotryl® 28 BA 175: Copolymer composed of ethene and n-butyl acrylate with ethene content of 70-<br>
74% by weight and MFI of 175 (commercially available product from Atofina Deutschland,<br>
Dusseldorf; since October 2004 Arkema GmbH, Dusseldorf)<br>
The compositions based on PA6 were compounded in a ZSK32 (Werner and Pfleiderer) twin-screw<br>
extruder at melt temperatures of from 270 to 285°C to give moulding compositions, and the melt<br>
was discharged into a water bath and then pelletized.<br>
The test specimens for the tests listed in the table were injection-moulded in an Arburg 320-210-500<br>
injection-moulding machine at a melt temperature of 280°C and at a mould temperature of 80°C:<br>
dumbbell specimens (thickness 3 mm to ISO 527)<br>
- 80 x 10 x 4 mm3 test specimens (to ISO 178)<br>
60 x 60 x 2 mm3 plaques<br>
The injection pressure is a processing parameter which was determined during injection moulding of<br>
dumbbell specimens. The injection pressure is the internal mould pressure applied close to the gate in<br>
order to fill the mould cavity. It is a characteristic inflection point in the curve of pressure as a<br>
function of time, between the mould-filling phase and compaction phase, and can be determined by<br>
way of process data capture.<br>
Except for the melt viscosity measurements and the determination of flow spiral length, the tests<br>
listed in the table were carried out on the abovementioned test specimens:<br>
Tensile test to determine tensile modulus and tensile stress at break to DIN EN ISO 527-2/1A.<br>
Tensile strain at break: extensibility determined to DIN EN ISO 527-2/1A.<br>
Flexural test to determine flexural modulus, flexural strength, outer fibre strain, and flexural stress<br>
to DIN EN ISO 178.<br>
Impact resistance: IZOD method to ISO 180/1U at room temperature and at -30°C.<br>
Shrinkage: to determine shrinkage properties, standardized plaques of dimensions<br>
60 mm x 60 mm x 2 mm (ISO 294-4) were injection-moulded. The test then determines longitudinal<br>
and transverse shrinkage, both for moulding shrinkage and for after-shrinkage. Total shrinkage is<br>
obtained by adding the moulding shrinkage to the after-shrinkage.<br>
Flow spiral length: flowability in a flow spiral (thickness 3 mm) was tested on the compounded<br>
materials from inventive example and comparative example at a melt temperature of 280°C and at a<br>
mould temperature of 80°C. The flow path in cm was measured (flow spiral length).<br>
Melt viscosity was determined to DIN 5481 I/ISO 11443 at the stated shear rate and temperature<br>
with Viscorobo 94.00 equipment from Gottfert after the pellets had been dried for 48 hours at 80°C<br>
in a vacuum dryer.<br>
Density was determined by the flotation method on test specimens to DIN EN ISO 1183-1.<br>
Surface: The quality of the surface was assessed and estimated visually on test specimens of<br>
dimensions 60 mm x 60 mm x 2 mm. The decisive criteria for assessment were gloss, smoothness,<br>
colour, and uniform surface structure.<br><br><br><br><br>
