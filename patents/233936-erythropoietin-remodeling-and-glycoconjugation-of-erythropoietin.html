				<td>TITLE OF THE INVENTION<br>
ERYTHROPOIETIN: REMODELING AND GLYCOCONJUGATION OF<br>
ERYTHROPOIETIN<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Most naturally occurring peptides contain carbohydrate moieties attached to the<br>
peptide via specific linkages to a select number of amino acids along the length of the<br>
primary peptide chain. Thus, many naturally occurring peptides are termed "glycopeptides.<br>
The variability of the glycosylation pattern on any given peptide has enormous implications<br>
for the function of that peptide. For example, the structure of the N-linked glycans on a<br>
peptide can impact various characteristics of the peptide, including the protease<br>
susceptibility, intracellular trafficking, secretion, tissue targeting, biological half-life and<br>
antigenicity of the peptide in a cell or organism. The alteration of one or more of these<br>
characteristics greatly affects the efficacy of a peptide in its natural setting, and also affects<br>
the efficacy of the peptide as a therapeutic agent in situations where the peptide has been<br>
generated for that purpose.<br>
The carbohydrate structure attached to the peptide chain is known as a "glycan"<br>
molecule. The specific glycan structure present on a peptide affects the solubility and<br>
aggregation characteristics of the peptide, the folding of the primary peptide chain and<br>
therefore its functional or enzymatic activity, the resistance of the peptide to proteolytic<br>
attack and the control of proteolysis leading to the conversion of inactive forms of the peptide<br>
to active forms. Importantly, terminal sialic acid residues present on the glycan molecule<br>
affect the length of the half life of the peptide in the mammalian circulatory system. Peptides<br>
whose glycans do not contain terminal sialic acid residues are rapidly removed from the<br>
circulation by the liver, an event which negates any potential therapeutic benefit of the<br>
peptide.<br>
The glycan structures found in naturally occurring glycopeptides are typically divided<br>
into two classes, N-linked and O-linked glycans.<br>
Peptides expressed in eukaryotic cells are typically N-glycosylated oh asparagine<br>
residues at sites in the peptide primary structure containing the sequence asparagine-X-<br>
serine/threonine where X can be any amino acid except proline and aspartic acid. The<br>
carbohydrate portion of such peptides is known as an N-linked glycan. The early events of<br>
N-glycosylation occur in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and are identical in mammals,<br>
plants, insects and other higher eukaryotes. First, an oligosaccharide chain comprising<br>
fourteen sugar residues is constructed on a lipid carrier molecule. As the nascent peptide is<br>
translated and translocated into the ER. the entire oligosaccharide chain is transferred to the<br>
amide group of the asparagine residue in a reaction catalyzed by a membrane bound<br>
glyeosyitransferase enzyme. The N-linked glycan is further processed both in the ER and in<br>
the Golgi apparatus. The further processing generally entails removal of some of the sugar<br>
residues and addition of other sugar residues in reactions catalyzed by glycosidases and<br>
glycosyltransferascs specific for the sugar residues removed and added.<br>
Typically, the final structures of the N-linked glycans are dependent upon the<br>
organism in which the peptide is produced. For example, in general, peptides produced in<br>
bacteria are completely unglycosylated. Peptides expressed in insect cells contain high<br>
mannose and paunci-mannose N-linked oligosaccharide chains, among others. Peptides<br>
produced in mammalian cell culture are usually glycosylated differently depending, e.g..<br>
upon the species and cell culture conditions. Even in the same species and under the same<br>
conditions, a certain amount of heterogeneity in the glycosyl chains is sometimes<br>
encountered. Further, peptides produced in plant cells comprise glycan structures that differ<br>
significantly from those produced in animal cells. The dilemma in the art of the production<br>
of recombinant peptides, particularly when the peptides are to be used as therapeutic agents,<br>
is to be able to generate peptides that are correctly glycosylated, i.e., to be able to generate a<br>
peptide having a glycan structure that resembles, or is identical to that present on the<br>
naturally occurring form of the peptide. Most peptides produced by recombinant means<br>
comprise glycan structures that are different from the naturally occurring glycans.<br>
A variety of methods have been proposed in the art to customize the glycosylation<br>
pattern of a peptide including those described in WO 99/22764, WO 98/58964, WO 99/54342<br>
and U.S. Patent No. 5,047,335, among others. Essentially, many of the enzymes required for<br>
the in vitro glycosylation of peptides have been cloned and sequenced. In some instances,<br>
these enzymes have been used in vitro to add specific sugars to an incomplete glycan<br>
molecule on a peptide. In other instances, cells have been genetically engineered to express a<br>
combination of enzymes and desired peptides such that addition of a desired sugar moiety to<br>
an expressed peptide occurs within the cell.<br>
Peptides may also be modified by addition of O-linked glycans, also called mucin-<br>
type glycans because of their prevalence on mucinous glycopeptide. Unlike "N-glycans that<br>
are linked to asparagine residues and are formed by en bloc transfer of oligosaccharide from<br>
lipid-bound intermediates, O-glycans are linked primarily to serine and threonine residues<br>
and are formed by the stepwise addition of sugars from nucleotide sugars (Tanner et al,<br>
Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 906:81-91 (1987); and Hounsell el al., Glycoconj. J. 13:19-26<br>
(1996)). Peptide function can be affected by the structure of the O-linked glycans present<br>
thereon. For example, the activity of P-selectin ligand is affected by the O-linked glycan<br>
structure present thereon. For a review of O-linked glycan structures, see Schachter and<br>
Brockhausen. The Biosynthesis of Branched O-Linked Glycans. 1989, Society for<br>
Experimental Biology, pp. 1-26 (Great Britain). Other glycosylation patterns are formed by<br>
linking glycosylphosphatidylinositol to the carboxyl-terminal carboxyl group of the protein<br>
(Takeda et al.. Trends Biochem. Sci. 20:367-371 (1995); and Udenfriend et al.Ann. Rev.<br>
Biochem. 64:593-591 (1995).<br>
Although various techniques currently exist to modify the N-linked glycans of<br>
peptides, there exists in the art the need for a generally applicable method of producing<br>
peptides having a desired, i.e., a customized glycosylation pattern. There is a particular need<br>
in the art for the customized in vitro glycosylation of peptides, where the resulting peptide<br>
can be produced at industrial scale. This and other needs are met by the present invention.<br>
The administration of glycosylated and non-glycosylated peptides for engendering a<br>
particular physiological response is well known in the medicinal arts. Among the best known<br>
peptides utilized for this purpose is insulin, which is used to treat diabetes. Enzymes have<br>
also been used for their therapeutic benefits. A major factor, which has limited the use of<br>
therapeutic peptides is the immunogenic nature of most peptides. In a patient, an<br>
immunogenic response to an administered peptide can neutralize the peptide and/or lead to<br>
the development of an allergic response in the patient. Other deficiencies of therapeutic<br>
peptides include suboptimal potency and rapid clearance rates. The problems inherent in<br>
peptide therapeutics are recognized in the art, and various methods of eliminating the<br>
problems have been investigated. To provide soluble peptide therapeutics, synthetic<br>
polymers have been attached to the peptide backbone.<br>
Poly(ethylene glycol) ("PEG") is an exemplary polymer that has been conjugated to<br>
peptides. The use of PEG to derivatize peptide therapeutics has been demonstrated to reduce<br>
the immunogenicity of the peptides and prolong the clearance time from the circulation. For<br>
example. U.S. Pat. No. 4,179,337 (Davis et al.) concerns non-immunogenic peptides, such as<br>
enzymes and peptide hormones coupled to polyethylene glycol (PEG) or polypropylene<br>
glycol. Between 10 and 100 moles of polymer are used per mole peptide and at least 15% of<br>
the physiological activity is maintained.<br>
WO 93/15189 (Veronese et al.) concerns a method to maintain the activity of<br>
polyethylene glycol-modified proteolytic enzymes by linking the proteolytic enzyme to a<br>
macromolecularized inhibitor. The conjugates are intended for medical applications.<br>
The principal mode of attachment of PEG, and its derivatives, to peptides is a non-<br>
specific bonding through a peptide amino acid residue. For example, U.S. Patent No.<br>
4,088,538 discloses an enzymatically active polymer-enzyme conjugate of an enzyme<br>
covalently linked to PEG. Similarly, U.S. Patent No. 4,496,689 discloses a covalently<br>
attached complex of a-1 protease inhibitor with a polymer such as PEG or<br>
methoxypoly(ethylene glycol) ("mPEG"). Abuchowski et al. (./. Biol. Chem. 252: 3578<br>
(1977) discloses the covalent attachment of mPEG to an amine group of bovine serum<br>
albumin. U.S. Patent No. 4,414,147 discloses a method of rendering interferon less<br>
hydrophobic by conjugating it to an anhydride of a dicarboxylic acid, such as poly(ethy!ene<br>
succinic anhydride). PCT WO 87/00056 discloses conjugation of PEG and<br>
poly(oxyethylated) polyols to such proteins as interferon-P, interleukin-2 and immunotoxins.<br>
EP 154.316 discloses and claims chemically modified lymphokines, such as IL-2 containing<br>
PEG bonded directly to at least one primary amino group of the lymphokine. U.S. Patent No.<br>
4.055,635 discloses pharmaceutical compositions of a water-soluble complex of a proteolytic<br>
enzyme linked covalently to a polymeric substance such as a polysaccharide.<br>
Another mode of attaching PEG to peptides is through the non-specific oxidation of<br>
glycosyl residues on a peptide. The oxidized sugar is utilized as a locus for attaching a PEG<br>
moiety to the peptide. For example, MTimkulu (WO 94/05332) discloses the use of a<br>
hydrazine- or amino-PEG to add PEG to a glycoprotein. The glycosyl moieties are randomly<br>
oxidized to the corresponding aldehydes, which are subsequently coupled to the armno-PEG.<br>
See also. Bona et al. (WO 96/40731), where a PEG is added to an immunoglobulin molecule<br>
by enzymatically oxidizing a glycan on the immunoglobulin and then contacting the glycan<br>
with an amino-PEG molecule.<br>
In each of the methods described above. poly(ethylene glycol) is added in a random,<br>
non-specific manner to reactive residues on a peptide backbone. For the production of<br>
therapeutic peptides, it is clearly desirable to utilize a derivatization strategy that results in the<br>
formation of a specifically labeled, readily characterizable, essentially homogeneous product.<br>
Two principal classes of enzymes are used in the synthesis of carbohydrates,<br>
glycosyltransferases (e.g., sialyltransferases, oligosaccharyltransferases. N-<br>
acetylglucosaminyltransferases), and glycosidases. The glycosidases are further classified as<br>
exoglycosidases {e.g., P-mannosidase, (3-glucosidase), and endoglycosidases (e.g., Endo-A.<br>
Endo-M). Each of these classes of enzymes has been successfully used synthetically to<br>
prepare carbohydrates. For a general review, see, Crout et al., Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2: 98-<br>
111 (1998).<br>
Glycosyltransferases modify the oligosaccharide structures on peptides.<br>
Glycosyltransferases are effective for producing specific products with good stereochemical<br>
and regiochemical control. Glycosyltransferases have been used to prepare oligosaccharides<br>
and to modify terminal N- and O-linked carbohydrate structures, particularly on peptides<br>
produced in mammalian cells. For example, the terminal oligosaccharides of glycopeptides<br>
have been completely sialylated and/or fucosylated to provide more consistent sugar<br>
structures, which improves glycopeptide pharmacodynamics and a variety of other biological<br>
properties. For example, p-l,4-galactosyltransferase is used to synthesize lactosamine. an<br>
illustration of the utility of glycosyltransferases in the synthesis of carbohydrates (see, e.g.,<br>
Wong et al., J. Org. Chem. 47: 5416-5418 (1982)). Moreover, numerous synthetic<br>
procedures have made use of ß-sialyltransferases to transfer sialic acid from cytidine-5'-<br>
monophospho-N-acetylneuraminic acid to the 3-OH or 6-OH of galactose (see, e.g., Kevin et<br>
al.. Chem. Eur. J. 2: 1359-1362 (1996)). Fucosyltransferases are used in synthetic pathways<br>
to transfer a fucose unit from guanosine-5'-diphosphofucose to a specific hydroxyl of a<br>
saccharide acceptor. For example, Ichikawa prepared sialyl Lewis-X by a method that<br>
involves the fucosylation of sialylated lactosamine with a cloned fucosyltransferase<br>
(Ichikawa et al, J. Am. Cham. Soc. 114: 9283-9298 (1992)). For a discussion of recent<br>
advances in glycoconjugate synthesis tor therapeutic use see, Koeller et al. Nature<br>
Biotechnology 18: 835-841 (2000). See also, U.S. Patent No. 5,876,980; 6,030,815;<br>
5,728.554; 5.922,577: and WO/9831826.<br>
Glycosidases can also be used to prepare saccharides. Glycosidases normally catalyze<br>
the hydrolysis of a glycosidic bond. However, under appropriate conditions, they can be used<br>
to form this linkage. Most glycosidases used for carbohydrate synthesis are exoglycosidases;<br>
the glycosyl transfer occurs at the non-reducing terminus of the substrate. The glycosidase<br>
binds a glycosyl donor in a glycosyl-enzyme intermediate that is either intercepted by water<br>
to yield the hydrolysis product, or by an acceptor, to generate a new glycoside or<br>
oligosaccharide. An exemplary pathway using an exoglycosidase is the synthesis of the core<br>
trisaccharide of all N-linked glycopeptides, including the ß-mannoside linkage, which is<br>
formed by the action of P-mannosidase (Singh et al., Chem. Commun. 993-994 (1996)).<br>
Tn another exemplary application of the use of a glycosidase to form a glycosidic<br>
linkage, a mutant glycosidase has been prepared in which the normal nucleophilic amino acid<br>
within the active site is changed to a non-nucleophilic amino acid. The mutant enzyme does<br>
not hydrolyze glycosidic linkages, but can still form them. Such a mutant glycosidase is used<br>
to prepare oligosaccharides using an a-glycosyl fluoride donor and a glycoside acceptor<br>
molecule (Withers et al., U.S. Patent No. 5,716,812).<br>
Although their use is less common than that of the exoglycosidases, endoglycosidases<br>
are also utilized to prepare carbohydrates. Methods based on the use of endoglycosidases<br>
have the advantage that an oligosaccharide, rather than a monosaccharide, is transferred.<br>
Oligosaccharide fragments have been added to substrates using end-P-N-acetylglucosamines<br>
such as endo-F, endo-M (Wang et al., Tetrahedron Lett. 37: 1975-1978); and Haneda et al.,<br>
Carbohydr. Res. 292: 61-70 (1996)).<br>
In addition to their use in preparing carbohydrates, the enzymes discussed above arc<br>
applied to the synthesis of glycopeptides as well. The synthesis of a homogenous glycoform<br>
of ribonuclease B has been published (Witte K.. et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 119: 2114-2118<br>
(1997)). The high mannose core of ribonuclease B was cleaved by treating the glycopeptide<br>
with endoglycosidase H. The cleavage occurred specifically between the two core GlcNAc<br>
residues. The tetrasaccharide sialyl Lewis X was then enzymatically rebuilt on the remaining<br>
GlcNAc anchor site on the now homogenous protein by the sequential use of p-1,4-<br>
galactosyltransferase. a-2,3-sialyltransferase and a-1,3-fucosyltransferase V. However,<br>
while each enzymatically catalyzed step proceeded in excellent yield, such procedures have<br>
not been adapted for the generation of glycopeptides on an industrial scale.<br>
Methods combining both chemical and enzymatic synthetic elements are also known<br>
in the art. For example. Yamamoto and coworkers (Carbohydr. Res. 305: 415-422 (1998))<br>
reported the chemoenzymatic synthesis of the glycopeptide, glycosylated Peptide T, using an<br>
endoglycosidase. The N-acetylglucosaminyl peptide was synthesized by purely chemical<br>
means. The peptide was subsequently enzymatically elaborated with the oligosaccharide of<br>
human transferrin peptide. The saccharide portion was added to the peptide by treating it<br>
with an endo-P-N-acetylglucosaminidase. The resulting glycosylated peptide was highly<br>
stable and resistant to proteolysis when compared to the peptide T and N-acetylglucosaminyl<br>
peptide T.<br>
The use of glycosyltransferases to modify peptide structure with reporter groups has<br>
been explored. For example, Brossmer et al. (U.S. Patent No. 5,405,753) discloses the<br>
formation of a fluorescent-labeled cytidine monophosphate ("CMP") derivative of sialic acid<br>
and the use of the fluorescent glycoside in an assay for sialyl transferase activity and for the<br>
fluorescent-labeling of cell surfaces, glycoproteins and peptides. Gross et al. {Analyt.<br>
Biochem. 186: 127 (1990)) describe a similar assay. Bean et al. (U.S. Patent No. 5.432.059)<br>
discloses an assay for glycosylation deficiency disorders utilizing reglycosylation of a<br>
deficiently glycosylated protein. The deficient protein is reglycosylated with a fluorescent-<br>
labeled CMP glycoside. Each of the fluorescent sialic acid derivatives is substituted with the<br>
fluorescent moiety at either the 9-position or at the amine that is normally acetylated in sialic<br>
acid. The methods using the fluorescent sialic acid derivatives are assays for the presence of"<br>
glycosyltransferases or for non-glycosylated or improperly glycosylated glycoproteins. The<br>
assays are conducted on small amounts of enzyme or glycoprotein in a sample of biological<br>
origin. The enzymatic derivatization of a glycosylated or non-glycosylated peptide on a<br>
preparative or industrial scale using a modified sialic acid has not been disclosed or suggested<br>
in the prior art.<br>
Considerable effort has also been directed towards the modification of cell surfaces by<br>
altering glycosyl residues presented by those surfaces. For example. Fukuda and coworkers<br>
have developed a method for attaching glycosides of defined structure onto cell surfaces.<br>
The method exploits the relaxed substrate specificity of a fucosyltransferase that can transfer<br>
fucose and fucose analogs bearing diverse glycosyl substrates (Tsuboi et ah../. Biol. Cheni.<br>
271:27213(1996)).<br>
Enzymatic methods have also been used to activate glycosyl residues on a<br>
glycopeptide towards subsequent chemical elaboration. The glycosyl residues are typically<br>
activated using galactose oxidase, which converts a terminal galactose residue to the<br>
corresponding aldehyde. The aldehyde is subsequently coupled to an amine-containing<br>
modifying group. For example, Casares et al. {Nature Biotech. 19: 142 (2001)) have attached<br>
doxorubicin to the oxidized galactose residues of a recombinant MHCH-peptide chimera.<br>
Glycosyl residues have also been modified to contain ketone groups. For example,<br>
Mahal and co-workers {Science 276: 1125 (1997)) have prepared N-levulinoyl mannosamine<br>
("ManLey"). which has a ketone functionality at the position normally occupied by the acetyl<br>
group in the natural substrate. Cells were treated with the ManLev, thereby incorporating a<br>
ketone group onto the cell surface. See, also Saxon et ah. Science 287: 2007 (2000): Hang et<br>
ah,./. Am. Chem. Sot: 123: 1242 (2001); Yarema et ah, J. Biol. Chem. 273: 31168 (1998);<br>
and Charter et ah. Glycobiology 10: 1049 (2000).<br>
The methods of modifying cell surfaces have not been applied in the absence of a cell<br>
to modify a glycosylated or non-glycosylated peptide. Further, the methods of cell surface<br>
modification are not utilized for the enzymatic incorporation preformed modified glycosyl<br>
donor moiety into a peptide. Moreover, none of the cell surface modification methods are<br>
practical for producing glycosyl-modified peptides on an industrial scale.<br>
Despite the efforts directed toward the enzymatic elaboration of saccharide structures,<br>
there remains still a need for an industrially practical method for the modification of<br>
glycosylated and non-glycosylated peptides with modifying groups such as water-soluble<br>
polymers, therapeutic moieties, biomolecules and the like. Of particular interest are methods<br>
in which the modified peptide has improved properties, which enhance its use as a<br>
therapeutic or diagnostic agent. The present invention fulfills these and other needs.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention includes methods and compositions for the cell free in vitro<br>
addition and/or deletion of sugars to or from a peptide molecule in such a manner as to<br>
provide a glycopeptide molecule having a specific customized or desired glycosylation<br>
pattern, wherein the glycopeptide is produced at an industrial scale. In a preferred<br>
embodiment of the invention, the glycopeptide so produced has attached thereto a modified<br>
sugar that has been added to the peptide via an enzymatic reaction. A key feature of the<br>
invention is to take a peptide produced by any cell type and generate a core glycan structure<br>
on the peptide, following which the glycan structure is then remodeled in vitro to generate a<br>
glycopeptide having a glycosylation pattern suitable for therapeutic use in a mammal. More<br>
specifically, it is possible according to the present invention, to prepare a glycopeptide<br>
molecule having a modified sugar molecule or other compound conjugated thereto, such that<br>
the conjugated molecule confers a beneficial property on the peptide. According to the<br>
present invention, the conjugate molecule is added to the peptide enzymatically because<br>
enzyme-based addition of conjugate molecules to peptides has the advantage of<br>
regioselectivity and stereoselectivity. The glycoconjugate may be added to the glycan on a<br>
peptide before or after glycosylation has been completed. In other words, the order of<br>
glycosylation with respect to glycoconjugation may be varied as described elsewhere herein.<br>
It is therefore possible, using the methods and compositions provided herein, to remodel a<br>
peptide to confer upon the peptide a desired glycan structure preferably having a modified<br>
sugar attached thereto. It is also possible, using the methods and compositions of the<br>
invention to generate peptide molecules having desired and or modified glycan structures at<br>
an industrial scale, thereby, for the first time, providing the art with a practical solution for<br>
the efficient production of improved therapeutic peptides.<br>

specifying the antibody, wherein the DNA or amino acid sequence has been obtained using<br>
synthetic DNA or amino acid sequence technology which is available and well known in the<br>
art.<br>
As used herein, a "functional" biological molecule is a biological molecule in a form<br>
in which it exhibits a property by which it is characterized. A functional enzyme, for<br>
example, is one which exhibits the characteristic catalytic activity by which the enzyme is<br>
characterized.3<br>
As used herein, the structure , is the point of connection between an<br>
amino acid or an amino acid sidechain in the peptide chain and the glycan structure.<br>
"N-linked" oligosaccharides are those oligosaccharides that are linked to a peptide<br>
backbone through asparagine, by way of an asparagine-N-acetylglucosamine linkage. N-<br>
linked oligosaccharides are also called "N-glycans." All N-linked oligosaccharides have a<br>
common pentasaccharide core of Man3GlcNAc2. They differ in the presence of, and in the<br>
number of branches (also called antennae) of peripheral sugars such as N-acetylglucosamine,<br>
galactose. N-acetylgalactosamine, fucose and sialic acid. Optionally, this structure may also<br>
contain a core fucose molecule and/or a xylose molecule.<br>
An "elemental trimannosyl core structure" refers to a glycan moiety comprising soleK<br>
a trimannosyl core structure, with no additional sugars attached thereto. When the term<br>
"elemental" is not included in the description of the "trimannosyl core structure," then the<br>
glycan comprises the trimannosyl core structure with additional sugars attached thereto.<br>
Optionally, this structure may also contain a core fucose molecule and/or a xylose molecule.<br>
The term 'elemental trimannosyl core glycopeptide" is used herein to refer to a<br>
glycopeptide having glycan structures comprised primarily of an elemental trimannosyl core<br>
structure. Optionally, this structure may also contain a core fucose molecule and/or a xylose<br>
molecule.<br>
"O-linked" oligosaccharides are those oligosaccharides that are linked to a peptide<br>
backbone through threonine, serine, hydroxyproline, tyrosine, or other hydroxy-containing<br>
amino acids.<br>
All oligosaccharides described herein are described with the name or abbreviation for<br>
the non-reducing saccharide (i.e., Gal), followed by the configuration of the glycosidic bond<br>
(a or P), the ring bond (1 or 2), the ring position of the reducing saccharide involved in the<br>
bond (2, 3, 4, 6 or 8), and then the name or abbreviation of the reducing saccharide (i.e..<br>
GlcNAc). Each saccharide is preferably a pyranose. For a review of standard glycobiology<br>
nomenclature see. Essentials of Glycobiology Varki et al. eds., 1999, CSHL Press.<br>
The term 'sialic acid" refers to any member of a family of nine-carbon carboxylated<br>
sugars. The most common member of the sialic acid family is N-acetyl-neuraminic acid (2-<br>
keto-5-acetamido-3,5-dideoxy-D-glycero-D-galactononulopyranos-l-onic acid (often<br>
abbreviated as Neu5Ac, NeuAc, or NANA). A second member of the family is N-glycolyl-<br>
neuraminic acid (Neu5Gc or NeuGc). in which the N-acetyl group of NeuAc is hydroxylase!.<br>
A third sialic acid family member is 2-keto-3-deoxy-nonulosonic acid (KDN) (Nadano et al.<br>
(1986). J. Biol. Chem.261: 11550-11557; Kanamori et al, J. Biol. Chem.265: 21811-21819<br>
(1990)). Also included are 9-substituted sialic acids such as a 9-0-C|-C6 acyl-Neu5Ac like<br>
9-0-lactyl-Neu5Ac or 9-0-acetyl-Neu5Ac, 9-deoxy-9-fluoro-Neu5Ac and 9-azido-9-deoxy-<br>
Neu5Ac. For review of the sialic acid family, see, e.g., Varki, Glycobiology 2: 25-40 (1992);<br>
Sialic Acids: Chemistry, Metabolism and Function, R. Schauer, Ed. (Springer-Verlag, New<br>
York (1992)). The synthesis and use of sialic acid compounds in a sialylation procedure is<br>
disclosed in international application WO 92/16640, published October 1, 1992.<br>
A peptide having "desired glycosylation'", as used herein, is a peptide that comprises<br>
one or more oligosaccharide molecules which are required for efficient biological activity of<br>
the peptide.<br>
A "disease" is a state of health of an animal wherein the animal cannot maintain<br>
homeostasis, and wherein if the disease is not ameliorated then the animal's health continues<br>
to deteriorate.<br>
The "area under the curve" or "AUC", as used herein in the context of administering a<br>
peptide drug to a patient, is defined as total area under the curve that describes the<br>
concentration of drug in systemic circulation in the patient as a function of time from zero to<br>
infinity.<br>
The term "half-life" or "t½", as used herein in the context of administering a peptide<br>
drug to a patient, is defined as the time required for plasma concentration of a drug in a<br>
patient to be reduced by one half. There may be more than one half-life associated with the<br>
peptide drug depending on multiple clearance mechanisms, redistribution, and other<br>
mechanisms well known in the art. Usually, alpha and beta half-lives are defined such that<br>
the alpha phase is associated with redistribution, and the beta phase is associated with<br>
clearance. However, with protein drugs that are, for the most part, confined to the<br>
bloodstream, there can be at least two clearance half-lives. For some glycosylated peptides,<br>
rapid beta phase clearance may be mediated via receptors on macrophages, or endothelial<br>
cells that recognize terminal galactose, N-acetylgalactosamine, N-acetylglucosamine,<br>
mannose, or fucose. Slower beta phase clearance may occur via renal glomerular filtration<br>
for molecules with an effective radius 
specific uptake and metabolism in tissues. GlycoPEGylation may cap terminal sugars (e.g.<br>
galactose or N-acetylgalactosamine) and thereby block rapid alpha phase clearance via<br>
receptors that recognize these sugars. It may also confer a larger effective radius and thereby<br>
decrease the volume of distribution and tissue uptake, thereby prolonging the late beta phase.<br>
Thus, the precise impact of glycoPEGylation on alpha phase and beta phase half-lives will<br>
vary depending upon the size, state of glycosylation, and other parameters, as is well known<br>
in the art. Further explanation of "half-life" is found in Pharmaceutical Biotechnology<br>
(1997. DFA Crommelin and RD Sindelar, eds., Harwood Publishers, Amsterdam, pp 101 —<br>
120).<br>
The term "residence time", as used herein in the context of administering a peptide<br>
drug to a patient, is defined as the average time that drug stays in the body of the patient after<br>
dosing.<br>
An "isolated nucleic acid" refers to a nucleic acid segment or fragment which has<br>
been separated from sequences which flank it in a naturally occurring slate, e.g.. a DNA<br>
fragment which has been removed from the sequences which are normally adjacent to the<br>
fragment, e.g., the sequences adjacent to the fragment in a genome in which it naturally<br>
occurs. The term also applies to nucleic acids which have been substantially purified from<br>
other components which naturally accompany the nucleic acid, e.g., RNA or DNA or<br>
proteins, which naturally accompany it in the cell. The term therefore includes, for example,<br>
a recombinant DNA which is incorporated into a vector, into an autonomously replicating<br>
plasmid or virus, or into the genomic DNA of a prokaryote or eukaryote, or which exists as a<br>
separate molecule (e.g., as a cDNA or a genomic or cDNA fragment produced by PCR or<br>
restriction enzyme digestion) independent of other sequences. It also includes a recombinant<br>
DNA which is part of a hybrid nucleic acid encoding additional peptide sequence.<br>
A "polynucleotide" means a single strand or parallel and anti-parallel strands of a<br>
nucleic acid. Thus, a polynucleotide may be either a single-stranded or a double-stranded<br>
nucleic acid.<br>
The term "nucleic acid" typically refers to large polynucleotides. The term<br>
"oligonucleotide" typically refers to short polynucleotides, generally no greater than about 50<br>
nucleotides.<br>
Conventional notation is used herein to describe polynucleotide sequences: the left-<br>
hand end of a single-stranded polynucleotide sequence is the 5'-end; the left-hand direction of<br>
a double-stranded polynucleotide sequence is referred to as the 5'-direction. The direction of<br>
5' to 3' addition of nucleotides to nascent RNA transcripts is referred to as the transcription<br>
direction. The DNA strand having the same sequence as an mRNA is referred to as the<br>
"coding strand"; sequences on the DNA strand which are located 5' to a reference point on the<br>
DNA are referred to as "upstream sequences"; sequences on the DNA strand which are 3' to a<br>
reference point on the DNA are referred to as "downstream sequences.'"<br>
"Encoding" refers to the inherent property of specific sequences of nucleotides in a<br>
polynucleotide, such as a gene, a cDNA, or an mRNA, to serve as templates for synthesis of<br>
other polymers and macromolecules in biological processes having either a defined sequence<br>
of nucleotides (i.e., rRNA, tRNA and mRNA) or a defined sequence of amino acids and the<br>
biological properties resulting therefrom. Thus, a nucleic acid sequence encodes a protein if<br>
transcription and translation of mRNA corresponding to that nucleic acid produces the<br>
protein in a cell or other biological system. Both the coding strand, the nucleotide sequence<br>
of which is identical to the mRNA sequence and is usually provided in sequence listings, and<br>
the non-coding strand, used as the template for transcription of a gene or cDNA. can be<br>
referred to as encoding the protein or other product of that nucleic acid or cDNA.<br>
Unless otherwise specified, a "nucleotide sequence encoding an amino acid sequence"<br>
includes all nucleotide sequences that are degenerate versions of each other and that encode<br>
the same amino acid sequence. Nucleotide sequences that encode proteins and RNA may<br>
include introns.<br>
"Homologous" as used herein, refers to the subunit sequence similarity between two<br>
polymeric molecules, e.g., between two nucleic acid molecules, e.g., two DNA molecules or<br>
two RNA molecules, or between two peptide molecules. When a subunit position in both of<br>
the two molecules is occupied by the same monomeric subunit, e.g., if a position in each of<br>
two DNA molecules is occupied by adenine, then they are homologous at that position. The<br>
homology between two sequences is a direct function of the number of matching or<br>
homologous positions, e.g.. if half (e.g.. five positions in a polymer ten subunits in length) of<br>
the positions in two compound sequences are homologous then the two sequences are 50%<br>
homologous, if 90% of the positions, e.g., 9 of 10, are matched or homologous, the two<br>
sequences share 90% homology. By way of example, the DNA sequences 3'ATTGCC5' and<br>
3TATGGC share 50% homology.<br>
As used herein, "homology" is used synonymously with "identity."<br>
The determination of percent identity between two nucleotide or amino acid<br>
sequences can be accomplished using a mathematical algorithm. For example, a<br>
mathematical algorithm useful for comparing two sequences is the algorithm of Karlin and<br>
Altschul (1990, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 87:2264-2268), modified as in Karlin and<br>
Altschul (1993, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90:5873-5877). This algorithm is incorporated<br>
into the NBLAST and XBLAST programs of Altschul. et al. (1990, J. Mol. Biol. 215:403-<br>
410), and can be accessed, for example at the National Center for Biotechnology Information<br>
(NCBI) world wide web site having the universal resource locator<br>
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/". BLAST nucleotide searches can be performed with<br>
the NBLAST program (designated "blastn" at the NCB1 web site), using the following<br>
parameters: gap penalty = 5; gap extension penalty = 2; mismatch penalty =- 3; match reward<br>
- 1: expectation value 10.0; and word size = 11 to obtain nucleotide sequences homologous<br>
to a nucleic acid described herein. BLAST protein searches can be performed with the<br>
XBLAST program (designated "blastn" at the NCBI web site) or the NCBI "blastp" program,<br>
using the following parameters: expectation value 10.0, BLOSUM62 scoring matrix to<br>
obtain amino acid sequences homologous to a protein molecule described herein. To obtain<br>
gapped alignments for comparison purposes, Gapped BLAST can be utilized as described in<br>
Altschul et al. (1997. Nucleic Acids Res. 25:3389-3402). Alternatively, PSl-Blast or PH1-<br>
Blast can be used to perform an iterated search which detects distant relationships between<br>
molecules (Id.) and relationships between molecules which share a common pattern. When<br>
utilizing BLAST, Gapped BLAST, PSl-Blast, and PHI-Blast programs, the default<br>
parameters of the respective programs (e.g., XBLAST and NBLAST) can be used. See<br>
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov.<br>
The percent identity between two sequences can be determined using techniques<br>
similar to those described above, with or without allowing gaps. In calculating percent<br>
identity, typically exact matches are counted.<br>
A "heterologous nucleic acid expression unit" encoding a peptide is defined as a<br>
nucleic acid having a coding sequence for a peptide of interest operably linked to one or<br>
more expression control sequences such as promoters and/or repressor sequences wherein at<br>
least one of the sequences is heterologous, i. e., not normally found in the host cell.<br>
By describing two polynucleotides as "operably linked" is meant that a single-<br>
stranded or double-stranded nucleic acid moiety comprises the two polynucleotides arranged<br>
within the nucleic acid moiety in such a manner that at least one of the two polynucleotides is<br>
able to exert a physiological effect by which it is characterized upon the other. By way of<br>
example, a promoter operably linked to the coding region of a nucleic acid is able to promote<br>
transcription of the coding region.<br>
As used herein, the term "promoter/regulatory sequence" means a nucleic acid<br>
sequence which is required for expression of a gene product operably linked to the<br>
promoter/regulator sequence. In some instances, this sequence may be the core promoter<br>
sequence and in other instances, this sequence may also include an enhancer sequence and<br>
other regulatory elements which are required for expression of the gene product. The<br>
promoter/regulatory sequence may, for example, be one which expresses the gene product in<br>
a tissue specific manner.<br>
A "constitutive promoter is a promoter which drives expression of a gene to which it<br>
is operably linked, in a constant manner in a cell. By way of example, promoters which drive<br>
expression of cellular housekeeping genes are considered to be constitutive promoters.<br>
An "inducible" promoter is a nucleotide sequence which, when operably linked with a<br>
polynucleotide which encodes or specifies a gene product, causes the gene product to be<br>
produced in a living cell substantially only when an inducer which corresponds to the<br>
promoter is present in the cell.<br>
A "tissue-specific" promoter is a nucleotide sequence which, when operably linked<br>
with a polynucleotide which encodes or specifies a gene product, causes the gene product to<br>
be produced in a living cell substantially only if the cell is a cell of the tissue type<br>
corresponding to the promoter.<br>
A "vector" is a composition of matter which comprises an isolated nucleic acid and<br>
which can be used to deliver the isolated nucleic acid to the interior of a cell. Numerous<br>
vectors are known in the art including, but not limited to, linear polynucleotides,<br>
polynucleotides associated with ionic or amphiphilic compounds, plasmids, and viruses.<br>
Thus, the term "vector" includes an autonomously replicating plasmid or a virus. The term<br>
should also be construed to include non-plasmid and non-viral compounds which facilitate<br>
transfer of nucleic acid into cells, such as. for example, polylysine compounds, liposomes,<br>
and the like. Examples of viral vectors include, but are not limited to, adenoviral vectors,<br>
adeno-associated virus vectors, retroviral vectors, and the like.<br>
"Expression vector" refers to a vector comprising a recombinant polynucleotide<br>
comprising expression control sequences operatively linked to a nucleotide sequence to be<br>
expressed. An expression vector comprises sufficient cis-acting elements for expression;<br>
other elements for expression can be supplied by the host cell or in an in vitro expression<br>
system. Expression vectors include all those known in the art, such as cosmids, plasmids<br>
(e.g.. naked or contained in liposomes) and viruses that incorporate the recombinant<br>
polynucleotide.<br>
A "genetically engineered" or "recombinant" cell is a cell having one or more<br>
modifications to the genetic material of the cell. Such modifications are seen to include, but<br>
are not limited to, insertions of genetic material, deletions of genetic material and insertion of<br>
genetic material that is extrachromasomal whether such material is stably maintained or not.<br>
A "peptide" is an oligopeptide, polypeptide, peptide, protein or glycoprotein. The use<br>
of the term "peptide" herein includes a peptide having a sugar molecule attached thereto<br>
when a sugar molecule is attached thereto.<br>
As used herein, "native form'" means the form of the peptide when produced by the<br>
cells and/or organisms in which it is found in nature. When the peptide is produced by a<br>
plurality of cells and/or organisms, the peptide may have a variety of native forms.<br>
"Peptide" refers to a polymer in which the monomers are amino acids and are joined<br>
together through amide bonds, alternatively referred to as a peptide. Additionally, unnatural<br>
amino acids, for example, P-alanine, phenylglycine and homoarginine are also included.<br>
Amino acids that are not nucleic acid-encoded may also be used in the present invention.<br>
Furthermore, amino acids that have been modified to include reactive groups, glycosylation<br>
sites, polymers, therapeutic moieties, biomolecules and the like may also be used in the<br>
invention. All of the amino acids used in the present invention may be either the D - or L -<br>
isomer thereof. The L -isomer is generally preferred. In addition, other peptidomimetics are<br>
also useful in the present invention. As used herein, "peptide" refers to both glycosylated and<br>
unglycosylated peptides. Also included are peptides that are incompletely glycosylated by a<br>
system that expresses the peptide. For a general review, see, Spatola, A. F., in Chemistry<br>
and Biochemistry OF Amino Acids, Peptides and Proteins, B. Weinstein, eds., Marcel<br>
Dekker, New York, p. 267 (1983).<br>
The term "peptide conjugate," refers to species of the invention in which a peptide is<br>
conjugated with a modified sugar as set forth herein.<br>
The term "amino acid" refers to naturally occurring and synthetic amino acids, as well<br>
as amino acid analogs and amino acid mimetics that function in a manner similar to the<br>
naturally occurring amino acids. Naturally occurring amino acids are those encoded by the<br>
genetic code, as well as those amino acids that are later modified, e.g., hydroxyproline, (-<br>
carboxyglutamate, and O-phosphoserine. Amino acid analogs refers to compounds that have<br>
the same basic chemical structure as a naturally occurring amino acid, i.e., an a carbon that is<br>
linked to a hydrogen, a carboxyl group, an amino group, and an R group, e.g., homoserine.<br>
norleucine, methionine sulfoxide, methionine methyl sulfonium. Such analogs have modified<br>
R groups (e.g., norleucine) or modified peptide backbones, but retain the same basic chemical<br>
structure as a naturally occurring amino acid. Amino acid mimetics refers to chemical<br>
compounds that have a structure that is different from the general chemical structure of an<br>
amino acid, but that function in a manner similar to a naturally occurring amino acid.<br>
As used herein, amino acids are represented by the full name thereof, by the three<br>
letter code corresponding thereto, or by the one-letter code corresponding thereto, as<br>
indicated in the following Table 1:<br><br>
The present invention also provides for analogs of proteins or peptides which<br>
comprise a protein as identified above. Analogs may differ from naturally occurring proteins<br>
or peptides by conservative amino acid sequence differences or by modifications which do<br><br>
not affect sequence, or by both. For example, conservative amino acid changes may be<br>
made, which although they alter the primary sequence of the protein or peptide, do not<br>
normally alter its function. Conservative amino acid substitutions typically include<br>
substitutions within the following groups:<br>
glycine, alanine;<br>
valine, isoleucine, leucine;<br>
aspartic acid, glutamic acid;<br>
asparagine, glutamine;<br>
serine, threonine;<br>
lysine, arginine;<br>
phenylalanine, tyrosine.<br>
Modifications (which do not normally alter primary sequence) include in vivo, or in<br>
vitro, chemical derivatization of peptides, e.g., acetylation, or carboxylation. Also included<br>
are modifications of glycosylation, e.g., those made by modifying the glycosylation patterns<br>
of a peptide during its synthesis and processing or in further processing steps; e.g., by-<br>
exposing the peptide to enzymes which affect glycosylation, e.g., mammalian glycosylating<br>
or deglycosylating enzymes. Also embraced are sequences which have phosphorylated<br>
amino acid residues, e.g., phosphotyrosine, phosphoserine, or phosphothreonine.<br>
It will be appreciated, of course, that the peptides may incorporate amino acid<br>
residues which are modified without affecting activity. For example, the termini may be<br>
dcrivatized to include blocking groups, i.e. chemical substituents suitable to protect and/or<br>
stabilize the N- and C-termini from "undesirable degradation", a term meant to encompass<br>
any type of enzymatic, chemical or biochemical breakdown of the compound at its termini<br>
which is likely to affect the function of the compound, i.e. sequential degradation of the<br>
compound at a terminal end thereof.<br>
Blocking groups include protecting groups conventionally used in the art of peptide<br>
chemistry which will not adversely affect the in vivo activities of the peptide. For example,<br>
suitable N-terminal blocking groups can be introduced by alkylation or acylation of the N-<br>
terminus. Examples of suitable N-terminal blocking groups include C1-C5 branched or<br>
unbranched alkyl groups, acyl groups such as formyl and acetyl groups, as well as substituted<br>
forms thereof, such as the acetamidomethyl (Acm), Fmoc or Boc groups. Desamino analogs<br>
of amino acids are also useful N-terminal blocking groups, and can either be coupled to the<br>
N-terminus of the peptide or used in place of the N-terminal reside. Suitable C-terminal<br>
blocking groups, in which the carboxyl group of the C-terminus is either incorporated or not,<br>
include esters, ketones or amides. Ester or ketone-forming alkyl groups, particularly lower<br>
alkyl groups such as methyl, ethyl and propyl, and amide-forming amino groups such as<br>
primary amines (-NH2). and mono- and di-alkylamino groups such as methylamino,<br>
ethylamino, dimethylamino, diethylamino, methylethylamino and the like are examples of C-<br>
terminal blocking groups. Descarboxylated amino acid analogues such as agmatine are also<br>
useful C-terminal blocking groups and can be either coupled to the peptide's C-terminal<br>
residue or used in place of it. Further, it will be appreciated that the free amino and carboxyl<br>
groups at the termini can be removed altogether from the peptide to yield desamino and<br>
descarboxylated forms thereof without affect on peptide activity.<br>
Other modifications can also be incorporated without adversely affecting the activity<br>
and these include, but are not limited to, substitution of one or more of the amino acids in the<br>
natural L-isomeric form with amino acids in the D-isomeric form. Thus, the peptide mainclude one or more D-amino acid resides, or may comprise amino acids which are all in the<br>
D-form. Retro-inverso forms of peptides in accordance with the present invention are also<br>
contemplated, for example, inverted peptides in which all amino acids are substituted with D-<br>
amino acid forms.<br>
Acid addition salts of the present invention are also contemplated as functional<br>
equivalents. Thus, a peptide in accordance with the present invention treated with an<br>
inorganic acid such as hydrochloric, hydrobromic, sulfuric, nitric, phosphoric, and the like, or<br>
an organic acid such as an acetic, propionic, glycolic, pyruvic, oxalic, malic, malonic,<br>
succinic, maleic, fumaric, tataric, citric, benzoic, cinnamic, mandelic, methanesulfonic.<br>
ethanesulfonic, p-toluenesulfonic, salicyclic and the like, to provide a water soluble salt of the<br>
peptide is suitable for use in the invention.<br>
Also included are peptides which have been modified using ordinary molecular<br>
biological techniques so as to improve their resistance to proteolytic degradation or to<br>
optimize solubility properties or to render them more suitable as a therapeutic agent. Analogs<br>
of such peptides include those containing residues other than naturally occurring L-amino<br>
acids, e.g., D-amino acids or non-naturally occurring synthetic amino acids. The peptides of<br>
the invention are not limited to products of any of the specific exemplary processes listed<br>
herein.<br>
As used herein, the term "MALDI" is an abbreviation for Matrix Assisted Laser<br>
Desorption Ionization. During ionization, SA-PEG (sialic acid-poly(ethylene glycol)) can be<br>
partially eliminated from the N-glycan structure of the glycoprotein.<br>
As used herein, the term "glycosyltransferase," refers to any enzyme/protein that has<br>
the ability to transfer a donor sugar to an acceptor moiety.<br>
As used herein, the term "modified sugar," refers to a naturally- or non-naturally-<br>
occurring carbohydrate that is enzymatically added onto an amino acid or a glycosyl residue<br>
of a peptide in a process of the invention. The modified sugar is selected from a number of<br>
enzyme substrates including, but not limited to sugar nucleotides (mono-, di-, and tri-<br>
phosphates), activated sugars (e.g., glycosyl halides, glycosyl mesylates) and sugars that are<br>
neither activated nor nucleotides.<br>
The "modified sugar" is covalently functionalized with a "modifying group.1' Useful<br>
modifying groups include, but are not limited to, water-soluble polymers, therapeutic<br>
moieties, diagnostic moieties, biomolecules and the like. The locus of functional ization with<br>
the modifying group is selected such that it does not prevent the "modified sugar" from being<br>
added enzymatically to a peptide.<br>
The term ""water-soluble" refers to moieties that have some detectable degree of<br>
solubility in water. Methods to detect and/or quantify water solubility are well known in the<br>
art. Exemplary water-soluble polymers include peptides, saccharides, poly(ethers),<br>
poly(amines), poly(carboxylic acids) and the like. Peptides can have mixed sequences or be<br>
composed of a single amino acid, e.g. poly(lysine). Similarly, saccharides can be of mixed<br>
sequence or composed of a single saccharide subunit, e.g., dextran, amylosc, chitosan, and<br>
poly(sialic acid). An exemplary poly(ether) is polyethylene glycol). Polyethylene imine) is<br>
an exemplary polyamine. and poly(aspartic) acid is a representative poly(carboxylic acid).<br>
"Poly(alkylenc oxide)" refers to a genus of compounds having a polyether backbone.<br>
Poly(alkylene oxide) species of use in the present invention include, for example, straight-<br>
and branched-chain species. Moreover. exemplary poly(alkylcnc oxide) species can<br>
terminate in one or more reactive, activatable, or inert groups. For example. poly(ethylene<br>
glycol) is a poly(alkylene oxide) consisting of repeating ethylene oxide subunits, which may<br>
or may not include additional reactive, activatable or inert moieties at either terminus. Useful<br>
poly(alkylene oxide) species include those in which one terminus is "capped" by an inert<br>
group, e.g., monomethoxy-poly(alkylenc oxide). When the molecule is a branched species, it<br>
may include multiple reactive, activatable or inert groups at the termini of the alkylene oxide<br>
chains and the reactive groups may be either the same or different. Derivatives of straight-<br>
chain poly(alkylene oxide) species that are heterobifunctional are also known in the art.<br>
The term, "glycosyl linking group," as used herein refers to a glycosyl residue to<br>
which an agent (e.g.. water-soluble polymer, therapeutic moiety, biomolecule) is covalently<br>
attached. In the methods of the invention, the "glycosyl linking group" becomes covalently<br>
attached to a glycosylated or unglycosylated peptide, thereby linking the agent to an amino<br>
acid and/or glycosyl residue on the peptide. A "glycosyl linking group" is generally derived<br>
from a "modified sugar" by the enzymatic attachment of the "modified sugar" to an amino<br>
acid and/or glycosyl residue of the peptide. More specifically, a "glycosyl linking group," as<br>
used herein, refers to a moiety that covalently joins a "modifying group," as discussed herein,<br>
and an amino acid residue of a peptide. The glycosyl linking group-modifying group adduct<br>
has a structure that is a substrate for an enzyme. The enzymes for which the glycosyl linking<br>
group-modifying group adduct are substrates are generally those capable of transferring a<br>
saccharyl moiety onto an amino acid residue of a peptide, e.g, a glycosyltransferase, amidase,<br>
glycosidase, trans-sialidase, etc. The "glycosyl linking group" is interposed between, and<br>
covalently joins a "modifying group" and an amino acid residue of a peptide.<br>
An "intact glycosyl linking group" refers to a linking group that is derived from a<br>
glycosyl moiety in which the individual saccharide monomer that links the conjugate is not<br>
degraded, e.g., oxidized, e.g., by sodium metaperiodate. "Intact glycosyl linking groups" of<br>
the invention may be derived from a naturally occurring oligosaccharide by addition of<br>
glycosyl unit(s) or removal of one or more glycosyl unit from a parent saccharide structure.<br>
An exemplary "intact glycosyl linking group" includes at least one intact, e.g., non-degraded,<br>
saccharyl moiety that is covalently attached to an amino acid residue on a peptide. The<br>
remainder of the "linking group" can have substantially any structure. For example, the<br>
modifying group is optionally linked directly to the intact saccharyl moiety. Alternatively.<br>
the modifying group is linked to the intact saccharyl moiety via a linker arm. The linker arm<br>
can have substantially any structure determined to be useful in the selected embodiment. In<br>
an exemplary embodiment, the linker arm is one or more intact saccharyl moieties, i.e. "the<br>
intact glycosyl linking group" resembles an oligosaccharide. Another exemplary intact<br>
glycosyl linking group is one in which a saccharyl moiety attached, directly or indirectly, to<br>
the intact saccharyl moiety is degraded and derivatized (e.g., periodate oxidation followed by<br>
reductive amination). Still a further linker arm includes the modifying group attached to the<br>
intact saccharyl moiety, directly or indirectly, via a cross-linker, such as those described<br>
herein or analogues thereof.<br>
"Degradation," as used herein refers to the removal of one or more carbon atoms from<br>
a saccharyl moiety.<br>
The terms "targeting moiety" and "targeting agent", as used herein, refer to species<br>
that will selectively localize in a particular tissue or region of the body. The localization is<br>
mediated by specific recognition of molecular determinants, molecular size of the targeting<br>
agent or conjugate, ionic interactions, hydrophobic interactions and the like. Other<br>
mechanisms of targeting an agent to a particular tissue or region are known to those of skill in<br>
the art.<br>
As used herein, "therapeutic moiety" means any agent useful for therapy including,<br>

radioactive agents. "Therapeutic moiety" includes prodrugs of bioactive agents, constructs in<br>
which more than one therapeutic moiety is linked to a carrier, e.g., multivalent agents.<br>
Therapeutic moiety also includes peptides, and constructs that include peptides. Exemplary<br>
peptides include those disclosed in Figure 28 and Tables 6 and 7, herein. "Therapeutic<br>
moiety" thus means any agent useful for therapy including, but not limited to. antibiotics,<br>
anti-inflammatory agents, anti-tumor drugs, cytotoxins, and radioactive agents. "Therapeutic<br>
moiety" includes prodrugs of bioactive agents, constructs in which more than one therapeutic<br>
moiety is linked to a carrier, e.g., multivalent agents.<br>
As used herein, "anti-tumor drug" means any agent useful to combat cancer including,<br>
but not limited to, cytotoxins and agents such as antimetabolites, alkylating agents,<br>
anthracyclines. antibiotics, antimitotic agents, procarbazine, hydroxyurea, asparaginase,<br>

term "anti-tumor drug," are conjugates of peptides with anti-tumor activity, e.g. TNF-oc.<br>
Conjugates include, but are not limited to those formed between a therapeutic protein and a<br>
glycoprotein of the invention. A representative conjugate is that formed between PSGL-1<br>
and TNF-oc.<br>

puromycin and analogs or homologs thereof. Other toxins include, for example, ricin, CC-<br>
1065 and analogues, the duocarmycins. Still other toxins include diphtheria toxin, and snake<br>
venom (e.g., cobra venom).<br>
As used herein, "a radioactive agent" includes any radioisotope that is effective in<br>
diagnosing or destroying a tumor. Examples include, but are not limited to, indium-111.<br>
cobalt-60 and technetium. Additionally, naturally occurring radioactive elements such as<br>
uranium, radium, and thorium, which typically represent mixtures of radioisotopes, are<br>
suitable examples of a radioactive agent. The metal ions are typically chelated with an<br>
organic chelating moiety.<br>
Many useful chelating groups, crown ethers, cryptands and the like are known in the<br>
art and can be incorporated into the compounds of the invention (e.g. EDTA, DTPA, DOTA.<br>
NTA, HDTA, etc. and their phosphonate analogs such as DTPP, EDTP, HDTP, NIP. etc).<br>

As used herein, "pharmaceutically acceptable carrier" includes any material, which<br>
when combined with the conjugate retains the activity of the conjugate activity and is non-<br>
reactive with the subject's immune system. Examples include, but are not limited to. any of<br>
the standard pharmaceutical carriers such as a phosphate buffered saline solution, water,<br>
emulsions such as oil/water emulsion, and various types of wetting agents. Other carriers<br>
may also include sterile solutions, tablets including coated tablets and capsules. Typically<br>
such carriers contain excipients such as starch, milk, sugar, certain types of clay, gelatin,<br>
stearic acid or salts thereof, magnesium or calcium stearate, talc, vegetable fats or oils, gums,<br>
glycols, or other known excipients. Such carriers may also include flavor and color additives<br>
or other ingredients. Compositions comprising such carriers are formulated by well known<br>
conventional methods.<br>
As used herein, "administering" means oral administration, administration as a<br>
suppository, topical contact, intravenous, intraperitoneal, intramuscular, intralesional,<br>
intranasal or subcutaneous administration, intrathecal administration, or the implantation of a<br>
slow-release device e.g., a mini-osmotic pump, to the subject.<br>
The term "isolated" refers to a material that is substantially or essentially free from<br>
components, which are used to produce the material. For peptide conjugates of the invention,<br>
the term "isolated" refers to material that is substantially or essentially free from components,<br>
which normally accompany the material in the mixture used to prepare the peptide conjugate.<br>
"Isolated" and "pure" are used interchangeably. Typically, isolated peptide conjugates of the<br>
invention have a level of purity preferably expressed as a range. The lower end of the range<br>
of purity for the peptide conjugates is about 60%, about 70% or about 80% and the upper end<br>
of the range of purity is about 70%, about 80%, about 90% or more than about 90%.<br>
When the peptide conjugates are more than about 90% pure, their purities are also<br>
preferably expressed as a range. The lower end of the range of purity is about 90%, about<br>
92%. about 94%. about 96% or about 98%. The upper end of the range of purity is about<br>
92%, about 94%, about 96%. about 98% or about ! 00% purity.<br>
Purity is determined by any art-recognized method of analysis (e.g., band intensity on<br>
a silver stained gel, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, HPLC, or a similar means).<br>
"Commercial scale" as used herein means about one or more gram of final product<br>
produced in the method.<br>
"Essentially each member of the population," as used herein, describes a<br>
characteristic of a population of peptide conjugates of the invention in which a selected<br>
percentage of the modified sugars added to a peptide are added to multiple, identical acceptor<br>
sites on the peptide. "Essentially each member of the population" speaks to the<br>
"homogeneity" of the sites on the peptide conjugated to a modified sugar and refers to<br>
conjugates of the invention, which are at least about 80%, preferably at least about 90% and<br>
more preferably at least about 95% homogenous.<br>
"Homogeneity." refers to the structural consistency across a population of acceptor<br>
moieties to which the modified sugars are conjugated. Thus, in a peptide conjugate of the<br>
invention in which each modified sugar moiety is conjugated to an acceptor site having the<br>
same structure as the acceptor site to which every other modified sugar is conjugated, the<br>
peptide conjugate is said to be about 100% homogeneous. Homogeneity is typically<br>
expressed as a range. The lower end of the range of homogeneity for the peptide conjugates<br>
is about 60%, about 70% or about 80% and the upper end of the range of purity is about 70%,<br>
about 80%, about 90% or more than about 90%.<br>
When the peptide conjugates are more than or equal to about 90% homogeneous, their<br>
homogeneity is also preferably expressed as a range. The lower end of the range of<br>
homogeneity is about 90%, about 92%), about 94%, about 96% or about 98%. The upper end<br>
of the range of purity is about 92%, about 94%, about 96%, about 98% or about 100%<br>
homogeneity. The purity of the peptide conjugates is typically determined by one or more<br>
methods known to those of skill in the art, e.g., liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry<br>
(LC-MS), matrix assisted laser desorption time of flight mass spectrometry (MALD1-TOF).<br>
capillary electrophoresis, and the like.<br>
"Substantially uniform glycoform" or a "substantially uniform glycosylation pattern."<br>
when referring to a glycopeptide species, refers to the percentage of acceptor moieties that<br>
are glycosylated by the glycosytransferase of interest {e.g., fucosytransferase). For<br>
example, in the case of a a 1,2 fucosyltransferase, a substantially uniform fucosylation pattern<br>
exists if substantially all (as defined below) of the Gal(31,4-GlcNAc-R and sialylated<br>
analogues thereof are fucosylated in a peptide conjugate of the invention. It will be<br>
understood by one of skill in the art, that the starting material may contain glycosylated<br>
acceptor moieties (e.g., fucosylated Galß1,4-GlcNAc-R moieties). Thus, the calculated<br>
percent glycosylation will include acceptor moieties that are glycosylated by the methods of<br>
the invention, as well as those acceptor moieties already glycosylated in the starting material.<br>
The term "substantially" in the above definitions of "substantially uniform' generally<br>
means at least about 40%, at least about 70%, at least about 80%, or more preferably at least<br>
about 90%, and still more preferably at least about 95% of the acceptor moieties for a<br>
particular glycosyltransferase are glycosylated.<br>
Description of the Invention<br>
I. Method to Remodel Glycan Chains<br>
The present invention includes methods and compositions for the in vitro addition<br>
and/or deletion of sugars to or from a glycopeptide molecule in such a manner as to provide a<br>
peptide molecule having a specific customized or desired glycosylation pattern, preferably<br>
including the addition of a modified sugar thereto. A key feature of the invention therefore is<br>
to take a peptide produced by any cell type and generate a core glycan structure on the<br>
peptide, following which the glycan structure is then remodeled in vitro to generate a peptide<br>
having a glycosylation pattern suitable for therapeutic use in a mammal.<br>
The importance of the glycosylation pattern of a peptide is well known in the art as<br>
are the limitations of present in vivo methods for the production of properly glycosylated<br>
peptides, particularly when these peptides are produced using recombinant DNA<br>
methodology. Moreover, until the present invention, it has not been possible to generate<br>
glycopeptides having a desired glycan structure thereon, wherein the peptide can be produced<br>
at industrial scale.<br>
In the present invention, a peptide produced by a cell is enzymatically treated in vitro<br>
by the systematic addition of the appropriate enzymes and substrates therefor, such that sugar<br>
moieties that should not be present on the peptide are removed, and sugar moieties, optionally<br>
including modified sugars, that should be added to the peptide are added in a manner to<br>
provide a glycopeptide having "desired glycosylation" as defined elsewhere herein.<br>
A. Method to remodel N-linked glycans<br>
In one aspect, the present invention takes advantage of the fact that most peptides of<br>
commercial or pharmaceutical interest comprise a common five sugar structure referred to<br>
herein as the trimannosyl core, which is N-linked to asparagine at the sequence Asn-X-<br>
Ser/Thr on a peptide chain. The elemental trimannosyl core consists essentially of two N-<br>
acctylglucosamine (GlcNAc) residues and three mannose (Man) residues attached to a<br>
peptide, i.e., it comprises these five sugar residues and no additional sugars, except that it<br>
may optionally include a fucose residue. The first GlcNAc is attached to the amide group of<br>
the asparagine and the second GlcNAc is attached to the first via a ß1,4 linkage. A mannose<br>
residue is attached to the second GlcNAc via a ß1,4 linkage and two mannose residues are<br>
attached to this mannose via an a1,3 and an a1,6 linkage respectively. A schematic depiction<br>
of a trimannosyl core structure is shown in Figure 1, left side. While it is the case that glycan<br>
structures on most peptides comprise other sugars in addition to the trimannosyl core, the<br>
trimannosyl core structure represents an essential feature of N-linked glycans on mammalian<br>
peptides.<br>
The present invention includes the generation of a peptide having a trimannosyl core<br>
structure as a fundamental element of the structure of the glycan molecules contained<br>
thereon. Given the variety of cellular systems used to produce peptides, whether the systems<br>
are themselves naturally occurring or whether they involve recombinant DNA methodology,<br>
the present invention provides methods whereby a glycan molecule on a peptide produced in<br>
any cell type can be reduced to an elemental trimannosyl core structure. Once the elemental<br>
trimannosyl core structure has been generated then it is possible using the methods described<br>
herein, to generate in vitro, a desired glycan structure on the peptide which confers on the<br>
peptide one or more properties that enhances the therapeutic effectiveness of the peptide.<br>
It should be clear from the discussion herein that the term "trimannosyl core" is used<br>
to describe the glycan structure shown in Figure 1, left side. Glycopeptides having a<br>
trimannosyl core structure may also have additional sugars added thereto, and for the most<br>
part, do have additional structures added thereto irrespective of whether the sugars give rise<br>
to a peptide having a desired glycan structure. The term "elemental trimannosyl core<br>
structure" is defined elsewhere herein. When the term "elemental" is not included in the<br>
description of the "trimannosyl core structure,'" then the glycan comprises the trimannosyl<br>
core structure with additional sugars attached to the mannose sugars.<br>
The term "elemental trimannosyl core glycopeptide" is used herein to refer to a<br>
glycopeptide having glycan structures comprised primarily of an elemental trimannosyl core<br>
structure. However, it may also optionally contain a fucose residue attached thereto. As<br>
discussed herein, elemental trimannosyl core glycopeptides are one optimal, and therefore<br>
preferred, starting material for the glycan remodeling processes of the invention.<br>
Another optimal starting material for the glycan remodeling process of the invention<br>
is a glycan structure having a trimannosyl core wherein one or two additional GlcNAc<br>
residues are added to each of the al.3 and the a1,6 mannose residues (see for example, the<br>
structure on the second line of Figure 2, second structure in from the left of the figure). This<br>
structure is referred to herein as "Man3GlcNAc4." When the structure is monoantenary, the<br>
structure is referred to herein as "Man3GlcNAc3." Optionally, this structure may also<br>
contain a core fucose molecule. Once the Man3GlcNAc3 or Man3GlcNAc4 structure has<br>
been generated then it is possible using the methods described herein, to generate in vitro, a<br>
desired glycan structure on the glycopeptide which confers on the glycopeptide one or more<br>
properties that enhances the therapeutic effectiveness of the peptide.<br>
In their native form, the N-linked glycopeptides of the invention, and particularly the<br>
mammalian and human glycopeptides useful in the present invention, are N-linked<br>
glycosylated with a trimannosyl core structure and one or more sugars attached thereto.<br>
The terms "glycopeptide" and "glycopolypeptide" are used synonymously herein to<br>
refer to peptide chains having sugar moieties attached thereto. "No distinction is made herein<br>
to differentiate small glycopdlypeptides or glycopeptides from large glycopolypeptides or<br>
glycopeptides. Thus, hormone molecules having very few amino acids in their peptide chain<br>
(e.g., often as few as three amino acids) and other much larger peptides are included in the<br>
general terms "glycopolypeptide" and "glycopeptide," provided they have sugar moieties<br>
attached thereto. However, the use of the term "peptide" does not preclude that peptide from<br>
being a glycopeptide.<br>
An example of an N-linked glycopeptide having desired glycosylation is a peptide<br>
having an N-linked glycan having a trimannosyl core with at least one GlcNAc residue<br>
attached thereto. This residue is added to the trimannosyl core using N-acetyl<br>
glucosaminyltransferase 1 (GnT-1). If a second GlcNAc residue is added, N-acetyl<br>
glucosaminyltransferase II (GnT-II) is used. Optionally, additional GlcNAc residues may be<br>
added with GnT-IV and/or GnT-V, and a third bisecting GlcNAc residue may be attached to<br>
the ß1,4 mannose of the trimannosyl core using N-acetyl glucosaminyltransferase III (GnT-<br>
III). Optionally, this structure may be extended by treatment with ß1,4 galactosyltransferase<br>
to add a galactose residue to each non-bisecting GlcNAc, and even further optionally, using<br>
a2,3 or a2,6-sialyltransferase enzymes, sialic acid residues may be added to each galactose<br>
residue. The addition of a bisecting GlcNAc to the glycan is not required for the subsequent<br>
addition of galactose and sialic acid residues; however, with respect to the substrate affinity<br>
of the rat and human GnT-II I enzymes, the presence of one or more of the galactose residues<br>
on the glycan precludes the addition of the bisecting GlcNAc in that the galactose-coniaining<br>
glycan is not a substrate for these forms of GnT-III. Thus, in instances where the presence of<br>
the bisecting GlcNAc is desired and these forms of GnT-III are used, it is important should<br>
the glycan contain added galactose and/or sialic residues, that they are removed prior to the<br>
addition of the bisecting GlcNAc. Other forms of GnT-III may not require this specific order<br>
of substrates for their activity. In the more preferred reaction, a mixture of GnT-I, GnT-II<br>
and GnT-III is added to the reaction mixture so that the GlcNAc residues can be added in any<br>
order.<br>
Examples of glycan structures which represent the various aspects of peptides having<br>
"desired glycosylation" are shown in the drawings provided herein. The precise procedures<br>
for the in vitro generation of a peptide having "desired glycosylation" are described<br>
elsewhere herein. However, the invention should in no way be construed to be limited solely<br>
to any one glycan structure disclosed herein. Rather, the invention should be construed to<br>
include any and all glycan structures which can be made using the methodology provided<br>
herein.<br>
In some cases, an elemental trimannosyl core alone may constitute the desired<br>
glycosylation of a peptide. For example, a peptide having only a trimannosyl core has been<br>
shown to be a useful component of an enzyme employed to treat Gaucher disease (Mistry et<br>
al.. 1966, Lancet 348: 1555-1559; Bijsterbosch et al., 1996, Eur. J. Biochem. 237:344-349).<br>
According to the present invention, the following procedures for the generation of<br>
peptides having desired glycosylation become apparent.<br>
a) Beginning with a glycopeptide having one or more glycan molecules which have<br>
as a common feature a trimannosyl core structure and at least one or more of a heterogeneous<br>
or homogeneous mixture of one or more sugars added thereto, it is possible to increase the<br>
proportion of glycopeptides having an elemental trimannosyl core structure as the sole glycan<br>
structure or which have Man3GIcNAc3 or Man3GlcNAc4 as the sole glycan structure. This<br>
is accomplished in vitro by the systematic addition to the glycopeptide of an appropriate<br>
number of enzymes in an appropriate sequence which cleave the heterogeneous or<br>
homogeneous mixture of sugars on the glycan structure until it is reduced to an elemental<br>
trimannosyl core or Man3GlcNAc3 or Man3GlcNAc4 structure. Specific examples of how<br>
this is accomplished will depend on a variety of factors including in large part the type of cell<br>
in which the peptide is produced and therefore the degree of complexity of the glycan<br>
structure(s) present on the peptide initially produced by the cell. Examples of how a complex<br>
glycan structure can be reduced to an elemental trimannosyl core or a Man3GlcNAc3 or<br>
Man3GlcNAc4 structure are presented in Figure 2 or are described in detail elsewhere herein.<br>
b) It is possible to generate a peptide having an elemental trimannosyl core structure<br>
as the sole glycan structure on the peptide by isolating a naturally occurring cell whose<br>
glycosylation machinery produces such a peptide. DNA encoding a peptide of choice is then<br>
transfected into the cell wherein the DNA is transcribed, translated and glycosylated such that<br>
the peptide of choice has an elemental trimannosyl core structure as the sole glycan structure<br>
thereon. For example, a cell lacking a functional GnT-I enzyme will produce several types of<br>
glycopeptides. In some instances, these will be glycopeptides having no additional sugars<br>
attached to the trimannosyl core. However, in other instances, the peptides produced may<br>
have two additional mannose residues attached to the trimannosyl core, resulting in a Man5<br>
glycan. This is also a desired starting material for the remodeling process of the present<br>
invention. Specific examples of the generation of such glycan structures are described<br>
herein.<br>
c) Alternatively, it is possible to genetically engineer a cell to confer upon it a<br>
specific glycosylation machinery such that a peptide having an elemental trimannosyl core or<br>
Man3GlcNAc3 or Man3GlcNAc4 structure as the sole glycan structure on the peptide is<br>
produced. DMA encoding a peptide of choice is then transfected into the cell wherein the<br>
DNA is transcribed, translated and glycosylated such that the peptide of choice has an<br>
increased number of glycans comprising solely an elemental trimannosyl core structure. For<br>
example, certain types of cells that are genetically engineered to lack GnT-I. may produce a<br>
glycan having an elemental trimannosyl core structure, or, depending on the cell, may<br>
produce a glycan having a trimannosyl core plus two additional mannose residues attached<br>
thereto (Man5). When the cell produces a Man5 glycan structure, the cell may be further<br>
genetically engineered to express mannosidase 3 which cleaves off the two additional<br>
mannose residues to generate the trimannosyl core. Alternatively, the Man5 glycan may be<br>
incubated in vitro with mannosidase 3 to have the same effect.<br>
d) When a peptide is expressed in an insect cell, the glycan on the peptide comprises<br>
a partially complex chain. Insect cells also express hexosaminidase in the cells which trims<br>
the partially complex chain back to a trimannosyl core structure which can then be remodeled<br>
as described herein.<br>
e) It is readily apparent from the discussion in b), c) and d) that it is not necessary<br>
that the cells produce only peptides having elemental trimannosyl core or Man3GlcNAc3 or<br>
Man3GleNAc4 structures attached thereto. Rather, unless the cells described in b) and c)<br>
produce peptides having 100% elemental trimannosyl core structures (i.e., having no<br>
additional sugars attached thereto) or 100% of Man3GlcNAc3 or Man3GlcNAc4 structures,<br>
the cells in fact produce a heterogeneous mixture of peptides having, in combination,<br>
elemental trimannosyl core structures, or Man3GlcNAc3 or Man3GlcNAc4 structures, as the<br>
sole glycan structure in addition to these structures having additional sugars attached thereto.<br>
The proportion of peptides having a trimannosyl core or Man3GlcNAc3 or Man3GlcNAc4<br>
structures having additional sugars attached thereto, as opposed to those having one structure,<br>
will vary depending on the cell which produces them. The complexity of the glycans (i.e.<br>
which and how many sugars are attached to the trimannosyl core) will also vary depending<br>
on the cell which produces them.<br>
1) Once a glycopeptide having an elemental trimannosyl core or a trimannosyl core<br>
with one or two GlcNAc residues attached thereto is produced by following a), b) or c)<br>
above, according to the present invention, additional sugar molecules are added in vitro to the<br>
trimannosyl core structure to generate a peptide having desired glycosylation (i.e., a peptide<br>
having an in vitro customized glycan structure).<br>
g) However, when it is the case that a peptide having an elemental trimannosyl core<br>
or Man3GlcNAc4 structure with some but not all of the desired sugars attached thereto is<br>
produced, then it is only necessary to add any remaining desired sugars without reducing the<br>
glycan structure to the elemental trimannosyl core or Man3GlcNAc4 structure. Therefore, in<br>
some cases, a peptide having a glycan structure having a trimannosyl core structure with<br>
additional sugars attached thereto, will be a suitable substrate for remodeling.<br>
Isolation of an elemental trimannosyl core glycopeptide<br>
The elemental trimannosyl core or Man3GlcNAc3 or Man3GlcNAc4 glycopeptides of<br>
the invention may be isolated and purified, if necessary, using techniques well known in the<br>
art of peptide purification. Suitable techniques include chromatographic techniques,<br>
isoelectric focusing techniques, ultrafiltration techniques and the like. Using any such<br>
techniques, a composition of the invention can be prepared in which the glycopeptides of the<br>
invention are isolated from other peptides and from other components normally found within<br>
cell culture media. The degree of purification can be, for example, 90% with respect to other<br>
peptides or 95%, or even higher, e.g., 98%. See, e.g., Deutscher et al. (ed.. 1990, Guide to<br>
Protein Purification, Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, San Diego).<br>
The heterogeneity of N-linkcd glycans present in the glycopeptides produced b\ the<br>
prior art methodology generally only permits the isolation of a small portion of the target<br>
glycopeptides which can be modified to produce desired glycopeptides. In the present<br>
methods, large quantities of elemental trimannosyl core glycopeptides and other desired<br>
glycopeptides, including Man3GlcNAc3 or Man3GlcNAc4 glycans, can be produced which<br>
can then be further modified to generate large quantities of peptides having desired<br>
glycosylation.<br>
Specific enrichment of any particular type of glycan linked to a peptide may be<br>
accomplished using lectins which have an affinity for the desired glycan. Such techniques<br>
are well known in the art of glycobiology.<br>
A key feature of the invention which is described in more detail below, is that once a<br>
core glycan structure is generated on any peptide, the glycan structure is then remodeled m<br>
vitro to generate a peptide having desired glycosylation that has improved therapeutic use in a<br>
mammal. The mammal may be any type of suitable mammal, and is preferably a human.<br>
The various scenarios and the precise methods and compositions for generating<br>
peptides with desired glycosylation will become evident from the disclosure which follows.<br>
The ultimate objective of the production of peptides for therapeutic use in mammals is<br>
that the peptides should comprise glycan structures that facilitate rather than negate the<br>
therapeutic benefit of the peptide. As disclosed throughout the present specification, peptides<br>
produced in cells may be treated in vitro with a variety of enzymes which catalyze the<br>
cleavage of sugars that should not be present on the glycan and the addition of sugars which<br>
should be present on the glycan such that a peptide having desired glycosylation and thus<br>
suitable for therapeutic use in mammals is generated. The generation of different glycoforms<br>
of peptides in cells is described above. A variety of mechanisms for the generation of<br>
peptides having desired glycosylation is now described, where the starting material i.e., the<br>
peptide produced by a cell may differ from one cell type to another. As will become apparent<br>
from the present disclosure, it is not necessary that the starting material be uniform with<br>
respect to its glycan composition. However, it is preferable that the starting material be<br>
enriched for certain glycoforms in order that large quantities of end product, i.e., correctly<br>
glycosylated peptides are produced.<br>
In a preferred embodiment according to the present invention, the degradation and<br>
synthesis events that result in a peptide having desired glycosylation involve at some point,<br>
the generation of an elemental trimannosyf core structure or a Man3GlcNAc3 or<br>
Man3GlcNAc4 structure on the peptide.<br>
The present invention also provides means of adding one or more selected glycosyl<br>
residues to a peptide, after which a modified sugar is conjugated to at least one of the selected<br>
glycosyl residues of the peptide. The present embodiment is useful, for example, when it is<br>
desired to conjugate the modified sugar to a selected glycosyl residue that is either not<br>
present on a peptide or is not present in a desired amount. Thus, prior to coupling a modified<br>
sugar to a peptide, the selected glycosyl residue is conjugated to the peptide by enzymatic or<br>
chemical coupling. In another embodiment, the glycosylation pattern of a peptide is altered<br>
prior to the conjugation of the modified sugar by the removal of a carbohydrate residue from<br>
the peptide. See for example WO 98/3 1826.<br>
Addition or removal of any carbohydrate moieties present on the peptide is<br>
accomplished either chemically or enzymatically. Chemical deglycosylation is preferably<br>
brought about by exposure of the peptide variant to the compound trifluoromethanesulfonic<br>
acid, or an equivalent compound. This treatment results in the cleavage of most or all sugars<br>
except the linking sugar (N-acetylglucosamine or N-acetylgalactosamine), while leaving the<br>
peptide intact. Chemical deglycosylation is described by Hakimuddin et al., 1987, Arch.<br>
Biochem. Biophys. 259: 52 and by Edge et al., 1981, Anal. Biochem. 118: 131. Enzymatic<br>
cleavage of carbohydrate moieties on peptide variants can be achieved by the use of a variety<br>
of endo- and exo-glycosidases as described by Thotakura et al., 1987, Meth. Enzymol. 138:<br>
350.<br>
Chemical addition of glycosyl moieties is carried out by any art-recognized method.<br>
Enzymatic addition of sugar moieties is preferably achieved using a modification of the<br>
methods set forth herein, substituting native glycosyl units for the modified sugars used in the<br>
invention. Other methods of adding sugar moieties are disclosed in U.S. Patent No.<br>
5.876,980. 6,030.815. 5,728,554, and 5.922,577.<br>
Exemplary attachment points for selected glycosyl residue include, but are not limited<br>
to: (a) sites for N- and O-glycosylation; (b) terminal glycosyl moieties that are acceptors for a<br>
glycosyltransferase; (c) arginine, asparagine and histidine; (d) free carboxyl groups; (e) free<br>
sulfhydryl groups such as those of cysteine; (f) free hydroxy! groups such as those of serine,<br>
threonine, or hydroxyproline; (g) aromatic residues such as those of phenylalanine, tyrosine,<br>
or tryptophan; or (h) the amide group of glutamine. Exemplary methods of use in the present<br>
invention are described in WO 87/05330 published Sep. 11, 1987, and in Aplin and Wriston,<br>
CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem., pp. 259-306 (1981).<br>
Dealing specifically with the examples shown in several of the figures provided<br>
herein, a description of the sequence of in vitro enzymatic reactions for the production of<br>
desired glycan structures on peptides is now presented. The precise reaction conditions for<br>
each of the enzymatic conversions disclosed below are well known to those skilled in the art<br>
of glycobiology and are therefore not repeated here. For a review of the reaction conditions<br>
for these types of reactions, see Sadler etal., 1982. Methods in Enzymology 83:458-514 and<br>
references cited therein.<br>
In Figure 1 there is shown the structure of an elemental trimannosyl core glycan on<br>
the left side. It is possible to convert this structure to a complete glycan structure having a<br>
bisecting GlcNAc by incubating the elemental trimannosyl core structure in the presence of<br>
GnT-I. followed by GnT-II, and further followed by GnT-III, and a sugar donor comprising<br>
UDP-GlcNAc, wherein GlcNAc is sequentially added to the elemental trimannosyl core<br>
structure to generate a trimannosyl core having a bisecting GlcNAc. In some instances, for<br>
example when remodeling Fc glycans as described herein, the order of addition of GnT-1,<br>
GnT-H and GnT-III may be contrary to that reported in the literature. The bisecting GlcNAc<br>
structure may be produced by adding a mixture of GnT-I, GnT-II and GnT-III and UDP-<br>
GlcNAc to the reaction mixture<br>
In Figure 3 there is shown the conversion of a bisecting GlcNAc containing<br>
trimannosyl core glycan to a complex glycan structure comprising galactose and N-acetyl<br>
neuraminic acid. The bisecting GlcNAc containing trimannosyl core glycan is first incubated<br>
with galactosyltransferase and UDP-Gal as a donor molecule, wherein two galactose residues<br>
are added to the peripheral GlcNAc residues on the molecule. The enzyme NeuAc-<br>
transferase is then used to add two NeuAc residues one to each of the galactose residues.<br>
In Figure 4 there is shown the conversion of a high mannose glycan structure to an<br>
elemental trimannosyl core glycan. The high mannose glycan (Man9) is incubated<br>
sequentially in the presence of the mannosidase 1 to generate a Man5 structure and then in<br>
the presence of mannosidase 3, wherein all but three mannose residues are removed from the<br>
glycan. Alternatively, incubation of the Man9 structure may be trimmed back to the<br>
trimannosyl core structure solely by incubation in the presence of mannosidase 3. According<br>
to the schemes presented in Figures 1 and 3 above, conversion of this elemental trimannosyl<br>
core glycan to a complex glycan molecule is then possible.<br>
In Figure 5 there is shown a typical complex N-linked glycan structure produced in<br>
plant cells. It is important to note that when plant cells are deficient in GnT-I enzymatic<br>
activity, xylose and fucose cannot be added to the glycan. Thus, the use of GnT-1 knock-out<br>
cells provides a particular advantage in the present invention in that these cells produce<br>
peptides having an elemental trimannosyl core onto which additional sugars can be added<br>
without performing any "trimming back" reactions. Similarly, in instances where the<br>
structure produced in a plant cell may be of the Man5 variety of glycan, if GnT-I is absent in<br>
these cells, xylose and fucose cannot be added to the structure. In this case, the Man5<br>
structure may be trimmed back to an elemental trimannosyl core (Man3) using mannosidase<br>
3. According to the methods provided herein, it is now possible to add desired sugar moieties<br>
to the trimannosyl core to generate a desired glycan structure.<br>
In Figure 6 there is shown a typical complex N-linked glycan structure produced in<br>
insect cells. As is evident, additional sugars, such as, for example, fucose may also be<br>
present. Further although not shown here, insect cells may produce high mannose glycans<br>
having as many as nine mannose residues and may have additional sugars attached thereto. It<br>
is also the case in insect cells that GnT-I knock out cells prevent the addition of fucose<br>
residues to the glycan. Thus, production of a peptide in insect cells mav preferably be<br>
accomplished in a GnT-I knock out cell. The glycan thus produced may then be trimmed<br>
back in vitro if necessary using any of the methods and schemes described herein, and<br>
additional sugars may be added in vitro thereto also using the methods and schemes provided<br>
herein.<br>
In Figure 2 there is shown glycan structures in various stages of completion.<br>
Specifically, the in vitro enzymatic generation of an elemental trimannosyl core structure<br>
from a complex carbohydrate glycan structure which does not contain a bisecting GlcNAc<br>
residue is shown. Also shown is the generation of a glycan structure therefrom which<br>
contains a bisecting GlcNAc. Several intermediate glycan structures which can be produced<br>
are shown. These structures can be produced by cells, or can be produced in the in vitro<br>
trimming back reactions described herein. Sugar moieties may be added in vitro to the<br>
elemental trimannosyl core structure, or to any suitable intermediate structure in order that a<br>
desired glycan is produced.<br>
In Figure 7 there is shown a series of possible in vitro reactions which can be<br>
performed to trim back and add onto glycans beginning with a high mannose structure. For<br>
example, a Man9 glycan may be trimmed using mannosidase 1 to generate a Man5 glycan, or<br>
it may be trimmed to a trimannosyl core using mannosidase 3 or one or more microbial<br>
mannosidases. GnT-I and or GnT-II may then be used to transfer additional GlcNAc residues<br>
onto the glycan. Further, there is shown the situation which would not occur when the glycan<br>
molecule is produced in a cell that does not have GnT-I (see shaded box). For example,<br>
fucose and xylose may be added to a glycan only when GnT-I is active and facilitates the<br>
transfer of a GlcNAc to the molecule.<br>
Figure 8 depicts well known strategies for the synthesis of biantennary. triantennary<br>
and even tetraantennary glycan structures beginning with the trimannosyl core structure.<br>
According to the methods of the invention, it is possible to synthesize each of these structures<br>
in vitro using the appropriate enzymes and reaction conditions well known in the art of<br>
glycobiology.<br>
Figure 9 depicts two methods for synthesis of a monoantennary glycan structure<br>
beginning from a high mannose (6 to 9 mannose moieties) glycan structures. A terminal<br>
sialic acid-PEG moiety may be added in place of the sialic acid moiety in accordance with<br>
glycoPBGylation methodology described herein. In the first method, endo-II is used to<br>
cleave the glycan structure on the peptide back to the first GlcNAc residue. Galactose is then<br>
added using galactosyltransferase and sialylated-PEG is added as described elsewhere herein.<br>
In the second method, mannosidase I is used to cleave mannose residues from the glycan<br>
structure in the peptide. A galactose residue is added to one arm of the remaining mannose<br>
residues which were cleaved off the glycan using Jack Bean oc-mannosidase. Sialylated-PEG<br>
is then added to this structure as directed.<br>
Figure 10 depicts two additional methods for synthesis of a monoantennary glycan<br>
structures beginning from high mannose (6 to 9 mannose moieties) glycan structure. As in<br>
Figure 9, a terminal sialic acid-PEG moiety may be added in place of the sialic acid moiety in<br>
accordance with the glycoPEGylation methodology described herein. In the situation<br>
described here, some of the mannose residues from the arm to which sialylated-PEG is not<br>
added, are removed.<br>
In Figure II there is shown a scheme for the synthesis of yet more complex<br>
carbohydrate structures beginning with a trimannosyl core structure. For example, a scheme<br>
for the in vitro production of Lewis x and Lewis a antigen structures, which may or may not<br>
be sialylated is shown. Such structures when present on a peptide may confer on the peptide<br>
immunological advantages for upregulating or downregulating the immune response. In<br>
addition, such structures are useful for targeting the peptide to specific cells, in that these<br>
types of structures are involved in binding to cell adhesion peptides and the like.<br>
Figure 12 is an exemplary scheme for preparing an array of O-linked peptides<br>
originating with serine or threonine.<br>
Figure 13 is a series of diagrams depicting the four types of O-linked glycan structure<br>
termed cores 1 through 4. The core structure is outlined in dotted lines. Sugars which may<br>
also be included in this structure include sialic acid residues added to the galactose residues,<br>
and fucose residues added to the GlcNAc residues.<br>
Thus, in preferred embodiments, the present invention provides a method of making<br>
an N-linked glycosylated glycopeptidc by providing an isolated and purified glycopeplide to<br>
which is attached an elemental trimannosyl core or a Man3GlcNAc4 structure, contacting the<br>
glycopeptide with a glycosyltransferase enzyme and a donor molecule having a glycosyl<br>
moiety under conditions suitable to transfer the glycosyl moiety to the glycopeptide.<br>
Customization of a trimannosyl core glycopeptide or Man3GlcNAc4 glycopeptide to produce<br>
a peptide having a desired glycosylation pattern is then accomplished by the sequential<br>
addition of the desired sugar moieties, using techniques well known in the art.<br>
Determination of Glycan Primary Structure<br>
When an N-linked glycopeptide is produced by a cell, as noted elsewhere herein, it<br>
may comprise a heterogeneous mixture of glycan structures which must be reduced to a<br>
common, generally elemental trimannosyl core or Man3GlcNAc4 structure, prior to adding<br>
other sugar moieties thereto. In order to determine exactly which sugars should be removed<br>
from any particular glycan structure, it is sometimes necessary that the primary glycan<br>
structure be identified. Techniques for the determination of glycan primary structure are well<br>
know in the art and are described in detail, for example, in Montreuil, "Structure and<br>
Biosynthesis of Glycopeptides" In Polysaccharides in Medicinal Applications, pp. 273-327,<br>
19%. Eds. Severian Damitriu, Marcel Dekker, NY. It is therefore a simple matter for one<br>
skilled in the art of glycobiology to isolate a population of peptides produced by a cell and<br>
determine the structure(s) of the glycans attached thereto. For example, efficient methods are<br>
available for (i) the splitting of glycosidic bonds either by chemical cleavage such as<br>
hydrolysis, acetolysis, hydrazinolysis, or by nitrous deamination; (ii) complete methylation<br>
followed by hydrolysis or methanolysis and by gas-liquid chromatography and mass<br>
spectroscopy of the partially methylated monosaccharides; and (iii) the definition of anomeric<br>
linkages between monosaccharides using exoglycosidases. which also provide insight into the<br>
primary glycan structure by sequential degradation. In particular, the techniques of mass<br>
spectroscopy and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometry, especially high field<br>
NMR have been successfully used to determine glycan primary structure.<br>
Kits and equipment for carbohydrate analysis are also commercially available.<br>
Fluorophore Assisted Carbohydrate Electrophoresis (FACE*) is available from Glyko, Inc.<br>
(Novato, CA). In FACE analysis, glycoconjugates are released from the peptide with cither<br>
Endo H or N-glycanase (PNGase F) for N-linked glycans, or hydrazine for Ser/Thr linked<br>
glycans. The glycan is then labeled at the reducing end with a fluorophore in a non-structure<br>
discriminating manner. The fluorophore labeled glycans are then separated in<br>
polyacrylamide gels based on the charge/mass ratio of the saccharide as well as the<br>
hydrodynamic volume. Images are taken of the gel under UV light and the composition of<br>
the glycans are determined by the migration distance as compared with the standards.<br>
Oligosaccharides can be sequenced in this manner by analyzing migration shifts due to the<br>
sequential removal of saccharides by exoglycosidase digestion.<br>
Exemplary embodiment<br>
The remodeling of N-linked glycosylation is best illustrated with reference to Formula<br>
1: <br>
where X3, X4, X5. X6, X7 and X17 are (independently selected) monosaccharide or<br>
oligosaccharide residues; and<br>
a. b, c, d, e and x are (independently selected) 0, 1 or 2, with the proviso that at least<br>
one member selected from a, b, c, d, e and x are 1 or 2.<br><br>
Formula 1 describes glycan structure comprising the tri-mannosyl core, which is<br>
preferably covalently linked to an asparagine residue on a peptide backbone. Preferred<br>
expression systems will express and secrete exogenous peptides with N-linked glycans<br>
comprising the tri-mannosyl core. Using the remodeling method of the invention, the glycan<br>
structures on these peptides can be conveniently remodeled to any glycan structure desired.<br>
Exemplary reaction conditions are found throughout the examples and in the literature.<br>
In preferred embodiments, the glycan structures are remodeled so that the structure<br>
described in Formula 1 has specific determinates. The structure of the glycan can be chosen<br>
to enhance the biological activity of the peptide, give the peptide a new biological activity,<br>
remove the biological activity of peptide, or better approximate the glycosylation pattern of<br>
the native peptide, among others.<br>
In the first preferred embodiment, the peptide N-linked glycans are remodeled to<br>
better approximate the glycosylation pattern of native human proteins. In this embodiment,<br>
the glycan structure described in Formula 1 is remodeled to have the following moieties:<br>
X3 and X5 = |-GlcNAc-Gal-SA;<br>
a and c = I;<br>
d = 0 or 1;<br>
b, e and x = 0.<br>
This embodiment is particularly advantageous for human peptides expressed in heterologous<br>
cellular expression systems. By remodeling the N-linked glycan structures to this<br>
configuration, the peptide can be made less immunogenic in a human patient, and/or more<br>
stable, among others.<br>
In the second preferred embodiment, the peptide N-linked glycans are remodeled to<br>
have a bisecting GlcNAc residue on the tri-mannosyl core. In this embodiment, the glycan<br>
structure described in Formula I is remodeled to have the following moieties:<br>
X3 and X5 are |-GlcNAc-Gal-SA;<br>
a and c = 1:<br>
X4 is GlcNAc;<br>
b=l;<br>
d = 0 or 1;<br>
e and x = 0.<br>
This embodiment is particularly advantageous for recombinant antibody molecules expressed<br>
in heterologous cellular systems. When the antibody molecule includes a Fc-mediated<br>
cellular cytotoxicity, it is known that the presence of bisected oligosaccharides linked the Fc<br>
domain dramatically increased antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity.<br>
In a third preferred embodiment, the peptide N-linked glycans are remodeled to have<br>
a sialylated Lewis X moiety. In this embodiment, the glycan structure described in Formula<br>
1 is remodeled to have the following moieties:<br><br>
This embodiment is particularly advantageous when the peptide which is being remodeling is<br>
intended to be targeted to selectin molecules and cells exhibiting the same.<br>
In a fourth preferred embodiment, the peptide N-linked glycans are remodeled to have<br>
a conjugated moiety. The conjugated moiety may be a PEG molecule, another peptide, a<br>
small molecule such as a drug, among others. In this embodiment, the glycan structure<br>
described in Formula I is remodeled to have the following moieties:<br>
X3 and Xs are |-GlcNAc-Gal-SA-R:<br>
a and c - 1 or 2;<br>
d = 0 or 1;<br>
b, d, e and x = 0;<br>
where R = conjugate group.<br>
The conjugated moiety may be a PEG molecule, another peptide, a small molecule such as a<br>
drug, among others. This embodiment therefore is useful for conjugating the peptide to PEG<br>
molecules that will slow the clearance of the peptide from the patient's bloodstream, to<br>
peptides that will target both peptides to a specific tissue or cell, or to another peptide of<br>
complementary therapeutic use.<br>
It will be clear to one of skill in the art that the invention is not limited to the preferred<br>
glycan molecules described above. The preferred embodiments are only a few of the many<br>
useful glycan molecules that can be made by the remodeling method of the invention. Those<br>
skilled in the art will know how to design other useful glycans.<br>
In the first exemplary embodiments, the peptide is expressed in a CHO (Chinese<br>
hamster ovarian cell line) according to methods well known in the art. When a peptide with<br>
N-linked glycan consensus sites is expressed and secreted from CHO cells, the N-linked<br>
glycans will have the structures depicted in top row of Figure 2, but also comprising a core<br>
fucose. While all of these structures may be present, by far the most common structures are<br>
the two at the right side. In the terms of Formula 1,<br>
X3 and X5 are |-GlcNAc-Gal-(SA);<br>
a and c = 1;<br>
b, e and x = 0. and<br>
d = 0 or 1.<br>
Therefore, in one exemplary embodiment, the N-linked glycans of peptides expressed in<br>
CHO cells are remodeled to the preferred humanized glycan by contacting the peptides with a<br>
glycosyltransferase that is specific for a galactose acceptor molecule and a sialic acid donor<br>
molecule. This process is illustrated in Figure 2 and Example 17. In another exemplary<br>
embodiment, the N-linked glycans of a peptide expressed and secreted from CHO cells are<br>
remodeled to be the preferred PEGylated structures. The peptide is first contacted with a<br>
glycosidase specific for sialic acid to remove the terminal SA moiety, and then contacted<br>
with a glycosyltransferase specific for a galactose acceptor moiety and an sialic acid acceptor<br>
moiety, in the presence of PEG- sialic acid-nucleotide donor molecules. Optionally, the<br>
peptide may then be contacted with a glycosyltransferase specific for a galactose acceptor<br>
moiety and an sialic acid acceptor moiety, in the presence of sialic acid-nucleotide donor<br>
molecules to ensure complete the SA capping of all of the glycan molecules.<br>
In other exemplary embodiments, the peptide is expressed in insect cells, such as the<br>
sf9 cell line, according to methods well known in the art. When a peptide with N-linked<br>
glycan consensus sites is expressed and secreted from sf9 cells, the N-linked glycans will<br>
often have the structures depicted in top row of Figure 6. In the terms of Formula 1:<br>
X3 and X5 are |- GlcNAc;<br>
a and c = 0 or 1;<br>
b = 0;<br>
X6 is fucose.<br>
d = 0. I or 2: and<br>
e and x = 0.<br>
The trimannose core is present in the vast majority of the N-linked glycans made by<br>
insect cells, and sometimes an antennary GlcNAc and/or fucose residue(s) are also present.<br>
Note that the glycan may have no core fucose, it may have a single core fucose having either<br>
linkage, or it may have a single core fucose with a perponderance of a single linkage. In one<br>
exemplary embodiment, the N-linked glycans of a peptide expressed and secreted from insect<br>
cells is remodeled to the preferred humanized glycan by first contacting the glycans with a<br>
glycosidase specific to fucose molecules, then contacting the glycans with a<br>
glycosyltransferases specific to the mannose acceptor molecule on each antennary of the<br>
trimannose core, a GlcNAc donor molecule in the presence of nucleotide-GlcNAc molecules:<br>
then contacting the glycans with a glycosyltransferase specific to a GlcNAc acceptor<br>
molecule, a Gal donor molecule in the presence of nucleotide-Gal molecules; and then<br>
contacting the glycans with a glycosyltransferase specific to a galactose acceptor molecule, a<br>
sialic acid donor molecule in the presence of nucleotide-SA molecules. One of skill in the art<br>
will appreciate that the fucose molecules, if any, can be removed at any time during the<br>
procedure, and if the core fucose is of the same alpha 1,6 linkage as found in human glycans,<br>
it may be left intact. In another exemplary embodiment, the humanized glycan of the<br>
previous example is remodeled further to the sialylated Lewis X glycan by contacting the<br>
glycan further with a glycosyltransferase specific to a GlcNAc acceptor molecule, a fucose<br>
donor molecule in the presence of nucleotide-fucose molecules. This process is illustrated in<br>
Figure 11 and Example 39.<br>
In yet other exemplary embodiments, the peptide is expressed in yeast, such as<br>
Saccharomyces cerevisiae, according to methods well known in the art. When a peptide with<br>
N-linked glycan consensus sites is expressed and secreted from S. cerevisiae cells, the N-<br>
linked glycans will have the structures depicted at the left in Figure 4. The N-linked glycans<br>
will always have the trimannosyl core, which will often be elaborated with mannose or<br>
related polysaccharides of up to 1000 residues. In the terms of Formula 1:<br>
X-1 and X' = |-Man - Man - (Man)0-1000;<br>
a and c =1 or 2:<br>
b, d, e and x = 0.<br>
In one exemplary embodiment, the N-linked glycans of a peptide expressed and<br>
secreted from yeast cells are remodeled to the elemental trimannose core by first contacting<br>
the glycans with a glycosidase specific to a2 mannose molecules, then contacting the glycans<br>
with a glycosidase specific to a6 mannose molecules. This process is illustrated in Figure 4<br>
and Example 38.<br>
In another exemplary embodiment, the N-linked glycans are further remodeled to<br>
make a glycan suitable for an recombinant antibody with Fc-mediated cellular toxicity<br>
function by contacting the elemental trimannose core glycans with a glycosyltransferase<br>
specific to the mannose acceptor molecule on each antennary of the trimannose core and a<br>
GlcNAc donor molecule in the presence of nucleotide-GlcNAc molecules. Then, the glycans<br>
are contacted with a glycosyltransferase specific to the acceptor mannose molecule in the<br>
middle of the trimannose core, a GlcNAc donor molecule in the presence of nucleotide-<br>
GlcNAc molecules and further contacting the glycans with a glycosyltransferase specific to a<br>
GlcNAc acceptor molecule, a Gal donor molecule in the presence of nucleotide-Gal<br>
molecules; and then optionally contacting the glycans with a glycosyltransferase specific to a<br>
galactose acceptor molecule and further optionally a sialic acid donor molecule in the<br>
presence of nucleotide-SA molecules. This process is illustrated in Figures 1, 2 and 3.<br>
In another exemplary embodiment, the peptide is expressed in bacterial cells, in<br>
particular E. coli cells, according to methods well known in the art. When a peptide with N-<br>
linked glycans consensus sites is expressed in E. coli cells, the N-linked consensus sites will<br>
not be glycosylated. In an exemplary embodiment, a humanized glycan molecule is built out<br>
from the peptide backbone by contacting the peptides with a glycosyltransferase specific for a<br>
N-linked consensus site and a GlcNAc donor molecule in the presence of nucleotide-<br>
GlcNAc; and further sequentially contacting the growing glycans with glycosyltransferases<br>
specific for the acceptor and donor moieties in the present of the required donor moiety until<br>
the desired glycan structure is completed. When a peptide with N-linked glycans is<br>
expressed in a eukaryotic cells but without the proper leader sequences that direct the nascent<br>
peptide to the golgi apparatus, the mature peptide is likely not to be glycosylated. In this case<br>
as well the peptide may be given N-linked glycosylation by building out from the peptide re-<br>
linked consensus site as aforementioned. When a protein is chemically modified with a sugar<br>
moiety, it can be built out as aforementioned.<br>
These examples are meant to illustrate the invention, and not to limit it. One of skill<br>
in the art will appreciate that the steps taken in each example may in some circumstances be<br>
able to be performed in a different order to get the same result. One of skill in the art will<br>
also understand that a different set of steps may also produce the same resulting glycan. The<br>
preferred remodeled glycan is by no means specific to the expression system that the peptide<br>
is expressed in. The remodeled glycans are only illustrative and one of skill in the art will<br>
know how to take the principles from these examples and apply them to peptides produced in<br>
different expression systems to make glycans not specifically described herein.<br>
B. Method to remodel O-linked glycans<br>
O-glycosylation is characterized by the attachment of a variety of monosaccharides in<br>
an O-glycosidic linkage to hydroxy amino acids. O-glycosylation is a widespread post-<br>
translational modification in the animal and plant kingdoms. The structural complexity of<br>
glycans O-linked to proteins vastly exceeds that of N-linked glycans. Serine or threonine<br>
residues of a newly translated peptide become modified by virtue of a peptidyl GalNAc<br>
transferase in the cis to trans compartments of the Golgi. The site of O-glycosylation is<br>
determined not only by the sequence specificity of the glycosyltransferase, but also<br>
epigenetic regulation mediated by competition between different substrate sites and<br>
competition with other glycosyltransferases responsible for forming the glycan.<br>
The O-linked glycan has been arbitrarily defined as having three regions: the core, the<br>
backbone region and the peripheral region. The "core'" region of an O-linked glycan is the<br>
inner most two or three sugars of the glycan chain proximal to the peptide. The backbone<br>
region mainly contributes to the length of the glycan chain formed by uniform elongation.<br>
The peripheral region exhibits a high degree of structural complexity. The structural<br>
complexity of the O-linked glycans begins with the core structure. In most cases, the first<br>
sugar residue added at the O-linked glycan consensus site is GalNAc; however the sugar may<br>
also be GlcNAc, glucose, mannose, galactose or fucose, among others. Figure 12 is a<br>
diagram of some of the known O-linked glycan core structures and the enzymes responsible<br>
for their in vivo synthesis.<br>
In mammalian cells, at leasteight different O-linked core structures are found, all<br>
based on a core-a-GalNAc residue. The four core structures depicted in Figure 13 are the<br>
most common. Core 1 and core 2 are the most abundant structures in mammalian cells, and<br>
core 3 and core 4 are found in more restricted, organ-characteristic expression systems. O-<br>
linked glycans are reviewed in Montreuil, Structure and Synthesis of Glycopeptides, In<br>
Polysaccharides in Medicinal Applications, pp. 273-327, 1996, Eds. Severian Damitriu.<br>
Marcel Dekker, NY. and in Schachter and Brockhausen, The Biosynthesis of Branched O-<br>
Linked Glycans, 1989, Society for Experimental Biology, pp. 1-26 (Great Britain).<br>
It will be apparent from the present disclosure that the glycan structure of O-<br>
glycosylated peptides can be remodeled using similar techniques to those described for N-<br>
linked glycans. O-glycans differ from N-glycans in that they are linked to a serine or<br>
threonine residue rather than an asparagine residue. As described herein with respect to N-<br>
glycan remodeling, hydrolytic enzymes can be used to cleave unwanted sugar moieties in an<br>
O-linked glycan and additional desired sugars can then be added thereto, to build a<br>
customized O-glycan structure on the peptide (See Figures 12 and 13).<br>
The initial step in O-glycosylation in mammalian cells is the attachment of N-<br>
acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) using any of a family of at least eleven known a-N-<br>
acetylgalactosaminyitransferases, each of which has a restricted acceptor peptide specificity.<br>
Generally, the acceptor peptide recognized by each enzyme constitutes a sequence of at least<br>
ten amino acids. Peptides that contain the amino acid sequence recognized by one particular<br>
GalNAc-transferase become O-glycosylated at the acceptor site if they are expressed in a cell<br>
expressing the enzyme and if they are appropriately localized to the Golgi apparatus where<br>
UDP-GalNAc is also present.<br>
However, in the case of recombinant proteins, the initial attachment of the GalNAc<br>
may not take place. The a-N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase enzyme native to the<br>
expressing cell may have a consensus sequence specificity which differs from that of the<br>
recombinant peptide being expressed.<br>
The desired recombinant peptide may be expressed in a bacterial cell, such as E. coli,<br>
that does not synthesize glycan chains. In these cases, it is advantageous to add the initial<br>
GalNAc moiety in vitro. The GalNAc moiety can be introduced in vitro onto the peptide<br>
once the recombinant peptide has been recovered in a soluble form, by contacting the peptide<br>
with the appropriate GalNAc transferase in the presence of UDP-GalNAc.<br>
In one embodiment, an additional sequence of amino acids that constitute an effective<br>
acceptor for transfer of an O-linked sugar may be present. Such an amino acid sequence is<br>
encoded by a DNA sequence fused in frame to the coding sequence of the peptide, or<br>
alternatively, may be introduced by chemical means. The peptide may be otherwise lacking<br>
glycan chains. Alternately, the peptide may have N- and/or O-linked glycan chains but<br>
require an additional glycosylation site, for example, when an additional glycan substituent is<br>
desired.<br>
In an exemplary embodiment, the amino acid sequence PTTTK-COOH. which is the<br>
natural GalNAc acceptor sequence in the human mucin MUC-1, is added as a fusion tag. The<br>
fusion protein is then expressed in E. coli and purified. The peptide is then contacted with<br>
recombinant human GalNAc-transferases T3 or T6 in the presence of UDP-GalNAc to<br>
transfer a GalNAc residue onto the peptide in vitro.<br>
This glycan chain on the peptide may then be further elongated using the methods<br>
described in reference to the N-linked or O-linked glycans herein. Alternatively, the GalNAc<br>
transferase reaction can be carried out in the presence of UDP-GalNAc to which PEG is<br>
covalently substituted in the 0-3. 4. or 6 positions or the N-2 position. Glycoconjugation is<br>
described in detail elswhere herein. Any antigenicity introduced into the peptide by the new<br>
peptide sequence can be conveniently masked by PEGylation of the associated glycan. The<br>
acceptor site fusion technique can be used to introduce not only a PEG moiety, but to<br>
introduce other glycan and non-glycan moieties, including, but not limited to. toxins, anti-<br>
infectives, cytotoxic agents, chelators for radionucleotides, and glycans with other<br>
functionalities, such as tissue targeting.<br>
Exemplary Embodiments<br>
The remodeling of O-linked glycosylation is best illustrated with reference to Formula<br>
2:<br>
- <br>
Formula 2 describes a glycan structure comprising a GalNAc which is covalently linked<br>
preferably to a serine or threonine residue on a peptide backbone. While this structure is used<br>
to illustrate the most common forms of O-linked glycans, it should not be construed to limit<br>
the invention solely to these O-linked glycans. Other forms of O-linked glycans are<br>
illustrated in Figure 12. Preferred expression systems useful in the present invention express<br>
and secrete exogenous peptides having O-linked glycans comprising the GalNAc residue.<br>
Using the remodeling methods of the invention, the glycan structures on these peptides can<br>
be conveniently remodeled to generate any desired glycan structure. One of skill in the art<br>
will appreciate that O-linked glycans can be remodeled using the same principles, enzymes<br>
and reaction conditions as those available in the art once armed with the present disclosure.<br>
Exemplary reaction conditions are found throughout the Examples.<br>
In preferred embodiments, the glycan structures are remodeled so that the structure<br>
described in Formula 2 has specific moieties. The structure of the glycan may be chosen to<br>
enhance the biological activity of the peptide, confer upon the peptide a new biological<br>
activity, remove or alter a biological activity of peptide, or better approximate the<br>
glycosylation pattern of the native peptide, among others.<br>
In the first preferred embodiment, the peptide O-linked glycans are remodeled to<br>
better approximate the glycosylation pattern of native human proteins. In this embodiment,<br>
the glycan structure described in Formula 2 is remodeled to have the following moieties:<br>
X2 is |-SA; or |-SA-SA;<br>
f and n = 0 or 1;<br>
X10 is SA;<br>
m = 0.<br>
This embodiment is particularly advantageous for human peptides expressed in heterologous<br>
cellular expression systems. By remodeling the O-linked glycan structures to have this<br>
configuration, the peptide can be rendered less immunogenic in a human patient and/or more<br>
stable.<br>
In the another preferred embodiment, the peptide O-linked glycans are remodeled to<br>
display a sialylated Lewis X antigen. In this embodiment, the glyean structure described in<br>
Formula 2 is remodeled to have the following moieties:<br>
X2is|-SA:<br>
X10 is Fuc or |-GlcNAc(Fuc)-Gal-SA;<br>
fand n I;<br>
m = 0.<br>
This embodiment is particularly advantageous when the peptide which is being remodeled is<br>
most effective when targeted to a selectin molecule and cells exhibiting the same.<br>
In a yet another preferred embodiment, the peptide O-linked glycans are remodeled to<br>
contain a conjugated moiety. The conjugated moiety may be a PEG molecule, another<br>
peptide, a small molecule such as a drug, among others. In this embodiment, the glyean<br>
structure described in Formula 2 is remodeled to have the following moieties:<br>
X2 is |-SA-R;<br>
f - 1;<br>
n and m - 0:<br>
where R is the conjugate group.<br>
This embodiment is useful for conjugating the peptide to PHG molecules that will slow the<br>
clearance of the peptide from the patient's bloodstream, to peptides that will target both<br>
peptides to a specific tissue or cell or to another peptide of complementary therapeutic use.<br>
It will be clear to one of skill in the art that the invention is not limited to the preferred<br>
glyean molecules described above. The preferred embodiments are only a few of the many<br>
useful glyean molecules that can be made using the remodeling methods of the invention.<br>
Those skilled in the art will know how to design other useful glycans once armed with the<br>
present invention.<br>
In the first exemplary embodiment, the peptide is expressed in a CHO (Chinese<br>
hamster cell line) according to methods well known in the art. When a peptide with O-linked<br>
glyean consensus sites is expressed and secreted from CHO cells, the majority of the O-<br>
linked glycans will often have the structure, in the terms of Formula 2.<br>
X2-|-SA:<br>
f= 1;<br>
m and n = 0.<br>
Therefore, most of the glycans in CHO cells do not require remodeling in order to be<br>
acceptable for use in a human patient. In an exemplary embodiment, the O-linked glycans of<br>
a peptide expressed and secreted from a CHO cell are remodeled to contain a sialylated<br>
Lewis X structure by contacting the glycans with a glycosyltransferasc specific for the<br>
GalNAc acceptor moiety and the fucose donor moiety in the presence of nucleotide-fucose.<br>
This process is illustrated on N-Iinked glycans in Figure 11 and Example 39.<br>
In other exemplary embodiments, the peptide is expressed in insect cells such as st9<br>
according to methods well known in the art. When a peptide having O-linked glycan<br>
consensus sites is expressed and secreted from most sf9 cells, the majority of the O-linked<br>
glycans have the structure, in the terms of Formula 2:<br>
X2 = H;<br>
f =-0 or I;<br>
n and m = 0.<br>
See, for example, Marchal et al., (2001, Biol. Chem. 382:151-159). In one exemplary<br>
embodiment, the O-linked glycan on a peptide expressed in an insect cell is remodeled to a<br>
humanized glycan by contacting the glycans with a glycosyltransferase specific for a GalNAc<br>
acceptor molecule and a galactose donor molecule in the presence of nucleotide-Gal; and<br>
then contacting the glycans with a glycosyltransferase specific for a Gal acceptor molecule<br>
and a SA donor molecule in the presence of nucleotide-SA. In another exemplary<br>
embodiment, the O-linked glycans are remodeled further from the humanized form to the<br>
sialylated Lewis X form by further contacting the glycans with a glycosyltransferase specific<br>
for a GalNAc acceptor molecule and a fucose donor molecule in the presence of nucleotide-<br>
fucose.<br>
In yet another exemplary embodiment, the peptide is expressed in fungal cells, in<br>
particular S. cerevisiae cells, according to methods well known in the art. When a peptide<br>
with O-linked glycans consensus sites is expressed and secreted from S. cerevisiae cells, the<br>
majority of the O-linked glycans have the structure:<br>
| - AA-Man- Man1-2.<br>
See Gemmill and Trimble (1999, Biochim. Biophys. Acta 1426:227-237). In order to<br>
remodel these O-linked glycans for use in human, it is preferable that the glycan be cleaved at<br>
the amino acid level and rebuilt from there.<br>
In an exemplary embodiment, the glycan is the O-linked glycan on a peptide<br>
expressed in a fungal cell and is remodeled to a humanized glycan by contacting the glycan<br>
with an endoglycosylase specific for an amino acid - GalNAc bond; and then contacting the<br>
glycan with a glycosyltransferase specific for a O-linked consensus site and a GalNAc donor<br>
molecule in the presence of nucleotide-GalNAc; contacting the glycan with a<br>
glycosyltransferase specific for a GalNAc acceptor molecule and a galactose donor molecule<br>
in the presence of nucleotide-Gal; and then contacting the glycans with a glycosyltransferase<br>
specific for a Gal acceptor molecule and a SA donor molecule in the presence of nucleotide-<br>
SA.<br>
Alternately, in another exemplary embodiment, the glycan is the O-linked glycan on a<br>
peptide expressed in a fungal cell and is remodeled to a humanized glycan by contacting the<br>
glycan with an protein O-mannose p-l,2-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (POMGnTI) in the<br>
presence of GlcNAc-nucleotide; then contacting the glycan with an galactosyltransferase in<br>
the presence of nucleotide-Gal; and then contracting the glycan with an sialyltransferase in<br>
the presence of nucleotide-SA.<br>
In another exemplary embodiment, the peptide is expressed in bacterial cells, in<br>
particular E. coli cells, according to methods well known in the art. When a peptide with an<br>
O-linked glycan consensus site is expressed in E. coli cells, the O-linked consensus site will<br>
not be glycosylated. In this case, the desired glycan molecule must be built out from the<br>
peptide backbone in a manner similar to that describe for S. cerevisiae expression above.<br>
Further, when a peptide having an O-linked glycan is expressed in a eukaryotic cell without<br>
the proper leader sequences to direct the nascent peptide to the golgi apparatus, the mature<br>
peptide is likely not to be glycosylated. In this case as well, an O-linked glycosyl structure<br>
may be added to the peptide by building out the glycan directly from the peptide O-linked<br>
consensus site. Further, when a protein is chemically modified with a sugar moiety, it can<br>
also be remodeled as described herein.<br>
These examples are meant to illustrate the invention, and not to limit it in any way.<br>
One of skill in the art will appreciate that the steps taken in each example may in some<br>
circumstances be performed in a different order to achieve the same result. One of skill in the<br>
art will also understand that a different set of steps may also produce the same resulting<br>
glycan. Futher, the preferred remodeled glycan is by no means specific to the expression<br>
system that the peptide is expressed in. The remodeled glycans are only illustrative and one<br>
of skill in the art will know how to take the principles from these examples and apply them :o<br>
peptides produced in different expression systems to generate glycans not specifically<br>
described herein.<br>
C. Glycoconjugation, in general<br>
The invention provides methods of preparing a conjugate of a glycosylated or an<br>
unglycosylated peptide. The conjugates of the invention are formed between peptides and<br>
diverse species such as water-soluble polymers, therapeutic moieties, diagnostic moieties,<br>
targeting moieties and the like. Also provided are conjugates that include two or more<br>
peptides linked together through a linker arm, i.e., multifunctional conjugates. The multi-<br>
functional conjugates of the invention can include two or more copies of the same peptide or<br>
a collection of diverse peptides with different structures, and/or properties.<br>
The conjugates of the invention are formed by the enzymatic attachment of a<br>
modified sugar to the glycosylated or unglycosylated peptide. The modified sugar, when<br>
interposed between the peptide and the modifying group on the sugar becomes what is<br>
referred to herein as "an intact glycosyl linking group." Using the exquisite selectivity of<br>
enzymes, such as glycosyltransferases, the present method provides peptides that bear a<br>
desired group at one or more specific locations. Thus, according to the present invention, a<br>
modified sugar is attached directly to a selected locus on the peptide chain or, alternatively,<br>
the modified sugar is appended onto a carbohydrate moiety of a peptide. Peptides in which<br>
modified sugars are linked to both a peptide carbohydrate and directly to an amino acid<br>
residue of the peptide backbone are also within the scope of the present invention.<br>
In contrast to known chemical and enzymatic peptide elaboration strategies, the<br>
methods of the invention make it possible to assemble peptides and glycopeptides that have a<br>
substantially homogeneous derivatization pattern; the enzymes used in the invention are<br>
generally selective for a particular amino acid residue or combination of amino acid residues<br>
of the peptide or particular glycan structure. The methods are also practical for large-scale<br>
production of modified peptides and glycopeptides. Thus, the methods of the invention<br>
provide a practical means for large-scale preparation of peptides having preselected<br>
substantially uniform derivatization patterns. The methods are particularly well suited for<br>
modification of therapeutic peptides, including but not limited to, peptides that are<br>
incompletely glycosylated during production in cell culture cells (e.g.. mammalian cells,<br>
insect cells, plant cells, fungal cells, yeast cells, or prokaryotic cells) or transgenic plants or<br>
animals.<br>
The methods of the invention also provide conjugates of glycosylated and<br>
unglycosylated peptides with increased therapeutic half-life due to, for example, reduced<br>
clearance rate, or reduced rate of uptake by the immune or reticuloendothelial system (RES).<br>
Moreover, the methods of the invention provide a means for masking antigenic determinants<br>
on peptides, thus reducing or eliminating a host immune response against the peptide.<br>
Selective attachment of targeting agents can also be used to target a peptide to a particular<br>
tissue or cell surface receptor that is specific for the particular targeting agent. Moreover,<br>
there is provided a class of peptides that are specifically modified with a therapeutic moiety.<br>
1. The Conjugates<br>
In a first aspect, the present invention provides a conjugate between a peptide and a<br>
selected moiety. The link between the peptide and the selected moiety includes an intact<br>
glycosyl linking group interposed between the peptide and the selected moiety. As discussed<br>
herein, the selected moiety is essentially any species that can be attached to a saccharide unit,<br>
resulting in a "modified sugar' that is recognized by an appropriate transferase enzyme,<br>
which appends the modified sugar onto the peptide. The saccharide component of the<br>
modified sugar, when interposed between the peptide and a selected moiety, becomes an<br>
"intact glycosyl linking group." The glycosyl linking group is formed from any mono- or<br>
oligo-saccharide that, after modification with a selected moiety, is a substrate for an<br>
appropriate transferase.<br>
The conjugates of the invention will typically correspond to the general structure:<br>
in which the symbols a, b, e, d and s represent a positive, non-zero integer; and I is<br>
either 0 or a positive integer. The "agent" is a therapeutic agent, a bioactive agent, a<br>
delectable label, water-soluble moiety or the like. The "agent" can be a peptide, e.g..<br>
enzyme, antibody, antigen, etc. The linker can be any of a wide array of linking groups.<br>
infra. Alternatively, the linker may be a single bond or a "zero order linker." The identity of<br>
the peptide is without limitation. Exemplary peptides are provided in Figure 28.<br>
In an exemplary embodiment, the selected moiety is a water-soluble polymer. The<br>
water-soluble polymer is covalently attached to the peptide via an intact glycosyl linking<br>
group. The glycosyl linking group is covalently attached to either an amino acid residue or a<br>
glycosyl residue of the peptide. Alternatively, the glycosyl linking group is attached to one<br>
or more glycosyl units of a glycopeptide. The invention also provides conjugates in which<br>
the glycosyl linking group is attached to both an amino acid residue and a glycosyl residue.<br>
In addition to providing conjugates that are formed through an enzymatically added<br>
intact glycosyl linking group, the present invention provides conjugates that are highly<br>
homogenous in their substitution patterns. Using the methods of the invention, it is possible<br>
to form peptide conjugates in which essentially all of the modified sugar moieties across a<br>
population of conjugates of the invention are attached to multiple copies of a structurally<br>
identical amino acid or glycosyl residue. Thus, in a second aspect, the invention provides a<br>
peptide conjugate having a population of water-soluble polymer moieties, which are<br>
covalently linked to the peptide through an intact glycosyl linking group. In a preferred<br>
conjugate of the invention, essentially each member of the population is linked via the<br>
glycosyl linking group to a glycosyl residue of the peptide, and each glycosyl residue of the<br>
peptide to which the glycosyl linking group is attached has the same structure.<br>
Also provided is a peptide conjugate having a population of water-soluble polymer<br>
moieties covalently linked thereto through an intact glycosyl linking group. In a preferred<br>
embodiment, essentially every member of the population of water soluble polymer moieties<br>
is linked to an amino acid residue of the peptide via an intact glycosyl linking group, and<br>
each amino acid residue having an intact glycosyl linking group attached thereto has the same<br>
structure.<br>
The present invention also provides conjugates analogous to those described above in<br>
which the peptide is conjugated to a therapeutic moiety, diagnostic moiety, targeting moiety.<br>
toxin moiety or the like via an intact glycosyl linking group. Each of the above-recited<br>
moieties can be a small molecule, natural polymer (e.g., peptide) or synthetic polymer.<br>
In an exemplary embodiment, interleukin-2 (IL-2) is conjugated to transferrin via a<br>
Afunctional linker that includes an intact glycosyl linking group at each terminus of the PEG<br>
moiety (Scheme 1). For example, one terminus of the PEG linker is functionalized with an<br>
intact sialic acid linker that is attached to transferrin and the other is functionalized with an<br>
intact GalNAc linker that is attached to IL-2.<br>
In another exemplary embodiment, EPO is conjugated to transferrin. In another<br>
exemplary embodiment, EPO is conjugated to glial derived neurotropic growth factor<br>
(GDNF). In these embodiments, each conjugation is accomplished via a bifunctional linker<br>
that includes an intact glycosyl linking group at each terminus of the PEG moiety, as<br>
aforementioned. Transferrin transfers the protein across the blood brain barrier.<br>
As set forth in the Figures appended hereto, the conjugates of the invention can<br>
include intact glycosyl linking groups that are mono- or multi-valent (e.g.. antennary<br>
structures), see, Figures 14-22. The conjugates of the invention also include glycosyl linking<br>
groups that are O-linked glycans originating from serine or threonine (Figure 11). Thus,<br>
conjugates of the invention include both species in which a selected moiety is attached to a<br>
peptide via a monovalent glycosyl linking group. Also included within the invention are<br>
conjugates in which more than one selected moiety is attached to a peptide via a multivalent<br>
linking group. One or more proteins can be conjugated together to take advantage of their<br>
biophysical and biological properties.<br>
In a still further embodiment, the invention provides conjugates that localize<br>
selectively in a particular tissue due to the presence of a targeting agent as a component of the<br>
conjugate. In an exemplary embodiment, the targeting agent is a protein. Exemplary<br>
proteins include transferrin (brain, blood pool), human serum (HS)-glycoprotein (bone, brain,<br>
blood pool), antibodies (brain, tissue with antibody-specific antigen, blood pool), coagulation<br>
Factors V-XII (damaged tissue, clots, cancer, blood pool), serum proteins, e.g., a-acid<br>
glycoprotein, fetuin. a-fetal protein (brain, blood pool). (32-glycoprotein (liver,<br>
atherosclerosis plaques, brain, blood pool), G-CSF, GM-CSF, M-CSF, and EPO (immune<br>
stimulation, cancers, blood pool, red blood cell overproduction, neuroprotection), and<br>
albumin (increase in half-life).<br>
In addition to the conjugates discussed above, the present invention provides methods<br>
for preparing these and other conjugates. Thus, in a further aspect, the invention provides a<br>
method of forming a covalent conjugate between a selected moiety and a peptide.<br>
Additionally, the invention provides methods for targeting conjugates of the invention to a<br>
particular tissue or region of the body.<br>
In exemplary embodiments, the conjugate is formed between a water-soluble<br>
polymer, a therapeutic moiety, targeting moiety or a biomolecule, and a glycosylated or non-<br>
glycosylated peptide. The polymer, therapeutic moiety or biomolecule is conjugated to the<br>
peptide via an intact glycosyl linking group, which is interposed between, and covalently<br>
linked to both the peptide and the modifying group (e.g., water-soluble polymer). The<br>
method includes contacting the peptide with a mixture containing a modified sugar and a<br>
glycosyltransferase for which the modified sugar is a substrate. The reaction is conducted<br>
under conditions sufficient to form a covalent bond between the modified sugar and the<br>
peptide. The sugar moiety of the modified sugar is preferably selected from nucleotide<br>
sugars, activated sugars and sugars, which are neither nucleotides nor activated.<br>
In one embodiment, the invention provides a method for linking two or more peptides<br>
through a linking group. The linking group is of any useful structure and may be selected<br>
from straight-chain and branched chain structures. Preferably, each terminus of the linker,<br>
which is attached to a peptide, includes a modified sugar (i.e., a nascent intact glycosyl<br>
linking group).<br>
In an exemplary method of the invention, two peptides are linked together via a linker<br>
moiety that includes a PEG linker. The construct conforms to the general structure set forth<br>
in the cartoon above. As described herein, the construct of the invention includes two intact<br>
glycosyl linking groups (i.e., s +1 = 1). The focus on a PEG linker that includes two glycosyl<br>
groups is for purposes of clarity and should not be interpreted as limiting the identity of linker<br>
arms of use in this embodiment of the invention.<br>
Thus, a PEG moiety is functionalized at a first terminus with a first glycosyl unit and<br>
at a second terminus with a second glycosyl unit. The first and second glycosyl units are<br>
preferably substrates for different transferases, allowing orthogonal attachment of the first<br>
and second peptides to the first and second glycosyl units, respectively. In practice, the<br>
(glycosyl)1-PEG-(glycosyl)2 linker is contacted with the first peptide and a first transferase<br>
for which the first glycosyl unit is a substrate, thereby forming<br>
(peptide)'-(glycosyl)'-PEG-(glycosyl)2. The first transferase and/or unreacted peptide is then<br>
optionally removed from the reaction mixture. The second peptide and a second transferase<br>
for which the second glycosyl unit is a substrate are added to the<br>
(peptide)1-(glycosyl)1-PBG-(glycosyl)2 conjugate, forming<br>
(peptide)1-(gIycosyl)1-PEG-(glycosyl)2-(peptide)2 . Those of skill in the art will appreciate<br>
that the method outlined above is also applicable to forming conjugates between more than<br>
two peptides by, for example, the use of a branched PEG, dendrimer, poly(amino acid),<br>
polysaccharide or the like.<br>
As noted previously, in an exemplary embodiment, interleukin-2 (IL-2) is conjugated<br>
to transferrin via a bifunctional linker that includes an intact glycosyl linking group at each<br>
terminus of the PEG moiety (Scheme 1). The IL-2 conjugate has an in vivo half-life that is<br>
increased over that of IL-2 alone by virtue of the greater molecular size of the conjugate.<br>
Moreover, the conjugation of IL-2 to transferrin serves to selectively target the conjugate to<br>
the brain. For example, one terminus of the PEG linker is functionalized with a CMP-sialic<br>
acid and the other is functionalized with an UDP-GalNAc. The linker is combined with IL-2<br>
in the presence of a GalNAc transferase, resulting in the attachment of the GalNAc of the<br>
linker arm to a serine and/or threonine residue on the IL-2.<br>
In another exemplary embodiment, transferrin is conjugated to a nucleic acid for use<br>
The processes described above can be carried through as many cycles as desired, and<br>
is not limited to forming a conjugate between two peptides with a single linker. Moreover,<br>
those of skill in the art will appreciate that the reactions functionalizing the intact glycosyl<br>
linking groups at the termini of the PEG (or other) linker with the peptide can occur<br>
simultaneously in the same reaction vessel, or they can be carried out in a step-wise fashion.<br>
When the reactions are carried out in a step-wise manner, the conjugate produced at each step<br>
is optionally purified from one or more reaction components (e.g., enzymes, peptides).<br>
A still further exemplary embodiment is set forth in Scheme 2. Scheme 2 shows a<br>
method of preparing a conjugate that targets a selected protein, e.g., EPO. to bone and<br>
increases the circulatory half-life of the selected protein.<br>
Scheme 2<br><br>
The use of reactive derivatives of PEG (or other linkers) to attach one or more peptide<br>
moieties to the linker is within the scope of the present invention. The invention is not<br>
limited by the identity of the reactive PEG analogue. Many activated derivatives of<br>
poly(ethylene glycol) are available commercially and in the literature. It is well within the<br>
abilities of one of skill to choose, and synthesize if necessary, an appropriate activated PEG<br>
derivative with which to prepare a substrate useful in the present invention. See, Abuchowski<br>

include the urethane linkage between amino groups and activated PEG. See, Veronese, et al,<br>

In another exemplary embodiment in which a reactive PEG derivative is utilized, the<br>
invention provides a method for extending the blood-circulation half-life of a selected<br>
peptide, in essence targeting the peptide to the blood pool, by conjugating the peptide to a<br>
synthetic or natural polymer of a size sufficient to retard the filtration of the protein by the<br>
glomerulus (e.g., albumin). This embodiment of the invention is illustrated in Scheme 3 in<br>
which erythropoietin (EPO) is conjugated to albumin via a PEG linker using a combination of<br>
chemical and enzymatic modification.<br>
Scheme 3<br><br>
Thus, as shown in Scheme 3, an amino acid residue of albumin is modified with a<br>
reactive PEG derivative, such as X-PEG-(CMP-sialic acid), in which X is an activating group<br>
(e.g., active ester, isothiocyanate, etc). The PEG derivative and EPO are combined and<br>
contacted with a transferase for which CMP-sialic acid is a substrate. In a further illustrative<br>
embodiment, an e-amine of lysine is reacted with the N-hydroxysuccinimide ester of the<br><br>
PEG-linker to form the albumin conjugate. The CMP-sialic acid of the linker is<br>
enzymatically conjugated to an appropriate residue on EPO, e.g., Gal. thereby forming the<br>
conjugate. Those of skill will appreciate that the above-described method is not limited to the<br>
reaction partners set forth. Moreover, the method can be practiced to form conjugates that<br>
include more than two protein moieties by. for example, utilizing a branched linker having<br>
more than two termini.<br>
2. Modified Sugars<br>
Modified glycosyl donor species ("modified sugars"') are preferably selected from<br>
modified sugar nucleotides, activated modified sugars and modified sugars that are simple<br>
saccharides that are neither nucleotides nor activated. Any desired carbohydrate structure can<br>
be added to a peptide using the methods of the invention. Typically, the structure will be a<br>
monosaccharide, but the present invention is not limited to the use of modified<br>
monosaccharide sugars; oligosaccharides and polysaccharides are useful as well.<br>
The modifying group is attached to a sugar moiety by enzymatic means, chemical<br>
means or a combination thereof, thereby producing a modified sugar. The sugars are<br>
substituted at any position that allows for the attachment of the modifying moiety, yet which<br>
still allows the sugar to function as a substrate for the enzyme used to ligate the modified<br>
sugar to the peptide. In a preferred embodiment, when sialic acid is the sugar, the sialic acid<br>
is substituted with the modifying group at either the 9-position on the pyruvyl side chain or at<br>
the 5-position on the amine moiety that is normally acetylated in sialic acid.<br>
In certain embodiments of the present invention, a modified sugar nucleotide is<br>
utilized to add the modified sugar to the peptide. Exemplary sugar nucleotides that are used<br>
in the present invention in their modified form include nucleotide mono-, di- or triphosphates<br>
or analogs thereof. In a preferred embodiment, the modified sugar nucleotide is selected<br>
from a UDP-glycoside, CMP-glycoside, or a GDP-glycoside. Even more preferably, the<br>
modified sugar nucleotide is selected from an UDP-galactose, UDP-galactosamine, UDP-<br>
glucose, UDP-glucosamine, GDP-mannose, GDP-fucose, CMP-sialic acid, or CMP-NeuAc.<br>
N-acetylamine derivatives of the sugar nucleotides are also of use in the method of the<br>
invention.<br>
The invention also provides methods for synthesizing a modified peptide using a<br>
modified sugar, e.g., modified-galactose, -fucose, and -sialic acid. When a modified sialic<br>
acid is used, either a sialyltransferase or a trans-sialidase (for a2,3-Iinked sialic acid only) can<br>
be used in these methods.<br>
In other embodiments, the modified sugar is an activated sugar. Activated modified<br>
sugars, which are useful in the present invention are typically glycosides which have been<br>
synthetically altered to include an activated leaving group. As used herein, the term<br>
"activated leaving group" refers to those moieties, which are easily displaced in enzyme-<br>
regulated nucleophilic substitution reactions. Many activated sugars are known in the art.<br>
See, for example, Vocadlo et al., In Carbohydrate Chemistry and Biology, Vol. 2. Ernst<br>
et al. Ed., Wiley-VCH Verlag: Weinheim, Germany, 2000; Kodama el al.. Tetrahedron Lett.<br>
34: 6419 (1993); Lougheed, et al., J. Biol. Chem. 274: 37717 (1999)).<br>
Examples of activating groups (leaving groups) include fluoro, chloro. bromo,<br>
tosylate ester, mesylate ester, triflate ester and the like. Preferred activated leaving groups,<br>
for use in the present invention, are those that do not significantly sterically encumber the<br>
enzymatic transfer of the glycoside to the acceptor. Accordingly, preferred embodiments of<br>
activated glycoside derivatives include glycosyl fluorides and glycosyl mesylates, with<br>
glycosyl fluorides being particularly preferred. Among the glycosyl fluorides, a-galactosyl<br>
fluoride, a-mannosyl fluoride, a-glucosyl fluoride, a-fucosyl fluoride, a-xylosyl fluoride, a-<br>
sialyl fluoride, a-N-acetylglucosaminyl fluoride, a-N-acetylgalactosaminyl fluoride, ß-<br>
galactosyl fluoride, ß-mannosyl fluoride, ß-glucosyl fluoride, ß-fucosyl fluoride. P-xylosyl<br>
fluoride, ß-sialyl fluoride, ß-N-acetylglucosaminyl fluoride and ß-"N-acetylgalactosaminyl<br>
fluoride are most preferred.<br>
By way of illustration, glycosyl fluorides can be prepared from the free sugar by first<br>
acetylating the sugar and then treating it with HF/pyridine. This generates the<br>
thermodynamically most stable anomer of the protected (acetylated) glycosyl fluoride (i.e.,<br>
the a-glycosyl fluoride). If the less stable anomer (i.e., the p-glycosyl fluoride) is desired, it<br>
can be prepared by converting the peracetylated sugar with HBr/HOAc or with HC1 to<br>
generate the anomeric bromide or chloride. This intermediate is reacted with a fluoride salt<br>
such as silver fluoride to generate the glycosyl fluoride. Acetylated glycosyl fluorides may<br>
be deprotected by reaction with mild (catalytic) base in methanol (e.g. NaOMe/MeOH). In<br>
addition, many glycosyl fluorides are commercially available.<br>
Other activated glycosyl derivatives can be prepared using conventional methods<br>
known to those of skill in the art. For example, glycosyl mesylates can be prepared by<br>
treatment of the fully benzylated hemiacetal form of the sugar with mesyl chloride, followed<br>
by catalytic hydrogenation to remove the benzyl groups.<br>
In a further exemplary embodiment, the modified sugar is an oligosaccharide having<br>
an antennary structure. In a preferred embodiment, one or more of the termini of the<br>
antennae bear the modifying moiety. When more than one modifying moiety is attached to<br>
an oligosaccharide having an antennary structure, the oligosaccharide is useful to "amplify"<br>
the modifying moiety; each oligosaccharide unit conjugated to the peptide attaches multiple<br>
copies of the modifying group to the peptide. The general structure of a typical chelate of the<br>
invention as set forth in the drawing above, encompasses multivalent species resulting from<br>
preparing a conjugate of the invention utilizing an antennary structure. Many antennary<br>
saccharide structures are known in the art, and the present method can be practiced with them<br>
without limitation.<br>
Exemplary modifying groups are discussed below. The modifying groups can be<br>
selected for one or more desirable property. Exemplary properties include, but are not<br>
limited to, enhanced pharmacokinetics, enhanced pharmacodynamics, improved<br>
biodistribution, providing a polyvalent species, improved water solubility, enhanced or<br>
diminished lipophilicity. and tissue targeting.<br>
P. Peptide Conjugates<br>
a) Water-Soluble Polymers<br>
The hydrophilicity of a selected peptide is enhanced by conjugation with polar<br>
molecules such as amine-, ester-, hydroxyl- and polyhydroxyl-containing molecules.<br>
Representative examples include, but are not limited to, polylysine, polyethyleneimine.<br>
poly(ethylene glycol) and poly(propyleneglycol). Preferred water-soluble polymers are<br>
essentially non-fluorescent, or emit such a minimal amount of fluorescence that they are<br>
inappropriate for use as a fluorescent marker in an assay. Polymers that are not naturally<br>
occurring sugars may be used. In addition, the use of an otherwise naturally occurring sugar<br>
that is modified by covalent attachment of another entity (e.g., poly(ethylene glycol),<br>
poly(propylene glycol), poly(aspartate), biomolecule, therapeutic moiety, diagnostic moiety.<br>
etc.) is also contemplated. In another exemplary embodiment, a therapeutic sugar moiety is<br>
conjugated to a linker arm and the sugar-linker arm is subsequently conjugated to a peptide<br>
via a method of the invention.<br>
Methods and chemistry for activation of water-soluble polymers and saccharides as<br>
well as methods for conjugating saccharides and polymers to various species arc described in<br>
the literature. Commonly used methods for activation of polymers include activation of<br>
functional groups with cyanogen bromide, periodate, glutaraldehyde, biepoxides,<br>
epichlorohydrin, divinylsulfone, carbodiimide, sulfonyl halides, trichlorotriazine, etc. {see. R.<br>

Routes for preparing reactive PEG molecules and forming conjugates using the<br>
reactive molecules are known in the art. For example. U.S. Patent No. 5.672.662 discloses a<br>
water soluble and isolatable conjugate of an active ester of a polymer acid selected from<br>
linear or branched poly(alkylene oxides), poly(oxyethylated polyols), poly(olefinic alcohols),<br>
and poly(acrylomorpholine), wherein the polymer has about 44 or more recurring units.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 6,376.604 sets forth a method for preparing a water-soluble 1-<br>
benzotriazolylcarbonate ester of a water-soluble and non-peptidic polymer by reacting a<br>
terminal hydroxyl of the polymer with di(l-benzotriazoyl)carbonate in an organic solvent.<br>
The active ester is used to form conjugates with a biologically active agent such as a protein<br>
or peptide.<br>
WO 99/45964 describes a conjugate comprising a biologically active agent and an<br>
activated water soluble polymer comprising a polymer backbone having at least one terminus<br>
linked to the polymer backbone through a stable linkage, wherein at least one terminus<br>
comprises a branching moiety having proximal reactive groups linked to the branching<br>
moiety, in which the biologically active agent is linked to at least one of the proximal reactive<br>
groups. Other branched poly(ethylene glycols) are described in WO 96/21469, U.S. Patent<br>
No. 5,932,462 describes a conjugate formed with a branched PEG molecule that includes a<br>
branched terminus that includes reactive functional groups. The free reactive groups arc<br>
available to react with a biologically active species, such as a protein or peptide, forming<br>
conjugates between the poly(ethylene glycol) and the biologically active species. U.S. Patent<br>
No. 5,446,090 describes a Afunctional PEG linker and its use in forming conjugates having a<br>
peptide at each of the PEG linker termini.<br>
Conjugates that include degradable PEG linkages are described in WO 99/34833; and<br>
WO 99/14259, as well as in U.S. Patent No. 6,348,558. Such degradable linkages are<br>
applicable in the present invention.<br>
Although both reactive PEG derivatives and conjugates formed using the derivatives<br>
are known in the art, until the present invention, it was not recognized that a conjugate could<br>
be formed between PEG (or other polymer) and another species, such as a peptide or<br>
glycopeptide, through an intact glycosyl linking group.<br>
Many water-soluble polymers are known to those of skill in the art and are useful in<br>
practicing the present invention. The term water-soluble polymer encompasses species such<br>
as saccharides (e.g.. dextran, amylosc, hyaluronic acid, poly (sialic acid), heparans, heparins,<br>
etc.); poly (amino acids), e.g., poly(glutamic acid); nucleic acids; synthetic polymers (e.g.,<br>
poly(acrylic acid), poly(ethers), e.g., poly(ethylene glycol); peptides, proteins, and the like.<br>
The present invention may be practiced with any water-soluble polymer with the sole<br>
limitation that the polymer must include a point at which the remainder of the conjugate can<br>
be attached.<br>
Methods for activation of polymers can also be found in WO 94/17039, U.S. Pat. No.<br>
5.324,844, WO 94/18247, WO 94/04193, U.S. Pat. No. 5,219,564, U.S. Pat. No. 5,122,614.<br>
WO 90/13540, U.S. Pat. No. 5,281,698, and more WO 93/15189, and for conjugation<br>
between activated polymers and peptides, e.g. Coagulation Factor VIII (WO 94/15625).<br>
hemoglobin (WO 94/09027), oxygen carrying molecule (U.S. Pat. No. 4,412,989),<br>
ribonuclease and superoxide dismutase (Veronese at ai. App. Biochem. Biotech. 11; 141-45<br>
(1985)).<br>
Preferred water-soluble polymers are those in which a substantial proportion of the<br>
polymer molecules in a sample of the polymer are of approximately the same molecular<br>
weight; such polymers are "homodisperse."<br>
The present invention is further illustrated by reference to a poly(ethylene glycol)<br>
conjugate. Several reviews and monographs on the functionalization and conjugation of PHG<br>
are available. See, for example, Harris, Macronol. Chem. Phys. C25: 325-373 (1985);<br>

Poly(ethylene glycol) molecules suitable for use in the invention include, but are not<br>
limited to, those described by the following Formula 3:<br><br>
R= H, alkyl, benzyl, aryl, acetal, OHC-, H2N-CH2CH2-, HS-CH2CH2-,<br><br>

In preferred embodiments, the poly(ethylene glycol) molecule is selected from the<br>
following:<br><br>
The poly(ethylene glycol) useful in forming the conjugate of the invention is either linear or<br>
branched. Branched poly(ethylene glycol) molecules suitable for use in the invention<br>
include, but are not limited to, those described by the following Formula:<br><br>

The in vivo half-life, area under the curve, and/or residence time of therapeutic<br>
peptides can also be enhanced with water-soluble polymers such as polyethylene glycol<br>
(PEG) and polypropylene glycol (PPG). For example, chemical modification of proteins with<br>
PEG (PEGylation) increases their molecular size and decreases their surface- and functional<br>
group-accessibility, each of which are dependent on the size of the PEG attached to the<br>
protein. This results in an improvement of plasma half-lives and in proteolytic-stabilily. and<br>
a decrease in immunogenicity and hepatic uptake (Chaffee et ah ./. Clin. Invest. 89: 1643-<br>
1651 (1992); Pyatak et ah Res. Commun. Chew. Pathol Pharmacol. 29: 113-127 (1980)).<br>
PEGylation of interleukin-2 has been reported to increase its antitumor potency in vivo (Kalre<br>
et al. Prot: Natl. -lead. Sci. USA. 84: 1487-1491 (1987)) and PEGylation of a F(ab')2 derived<br>
from the monoclonal antibody A7 has improved its tumor localization (Kitamura et al.,<br>
Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 28: 1387-1394(1990)).<br>
In one preferred embodiment, the in vivo half-life of a peptide derivatized with a<br>
water-soluble polymer by a method of the invention is increased relevant to the in vivo half-<br>
life of the non-derivatized peptide. In another preferred embodiment, the area under the<br>
curve of a peptide derivatized with a water-soluble polymer using a method of the invention<br>
is increased relevant to the area under the curve of the non-derivatized peptide. In another<br>
preferred embodiment, the residence time of a peptide derivatized with a water-soluble<br>
polymer using a method of the invention is increased relevant to the residence time of the<br>
non-derivatized peptide. Techniques to determine the in vivo half-life, the area under the<br>
curve and the residence time are well known in the art. Descriptions of such techniques can<br>
be found in J.G. Wagner, 1993, Pharmacokinetics for the Pharmaceutical Scientist.<br>
Technomic Publishing Company. Inc. Lancaster PA.<br>
The increase in peptide in vivo half-life is best expressed as a range of percent<br>
increase in this quantity. The lower end of the range of percent increase is about 40%, about<br>
60%. about 80%. about 100%. about 150% or about 200%. The upper end of the range is<br>
about 60%, about 80%. about 100%. about 150%. or more than about 250%.<br>
In an exemplary embodiment, the present invention provides a PEGylated follicle<br>
stimulating hormone (Examples 23 and 24). In a further exemplary embodiment, the<br>
invention provides a PEGylated transferrin (Example 42).<br>
Other exemplary water-soluble polymers of use in the invention include, but are not<br>
limited to linear or branched poly(alkylene oxides), poly(oxyethylated polyols), poly(olefinic<br>
alcohols), and poly(acrylomorpholine), dextran, starch, poly(amino acids), etc.<br>
b) Water-insoluble polymers<br>
The conjugates of the invention may also include one or more water-insoluble<br>
polymers. This embodiment of the invention is illustrated by the use of the conjugate as a<br>
vehicle with which to deliver a therapeutic peptide in a controlled manner. Polymeric drug<br>
delivery systems are known in the art. See, for example, Dunn et al, Eds. Polymeric<br>
Drugs And Drug Delivery Systems, ACS Symposium Series Vol. 469, American<br>
Chemical Society, Washington, D.C. 1991. Those of skill in the art will appreciate that<br>
substantially any known drug delivery system is applicable to the conjugates of the present<br>
invention.<br>
Representative water-insoluble polymers include, but are not limited to,<br>
polyphosphazines, poly(vinyl alcohols), polyamides, polycarbonates, polyalkylenes,<br>
polyacry lam ides, polyalkylene glycols, polyalkylene oxides, polyalkylene terephthalates.<br>
polyvinyl ethers, polyvinyl esters, polyvinyl halides, polyvinylpyrrolidone, polyglycolides,<br>
polysiloxanes, polyurethanes, poly(methyl methacrylate), poly(ethyl methacrylate),<br>
poly(butyl methacrylate), poly(isobutyl methacrylate), poly(hexyl methacrylate),<br>
poly(isodecyl methacrylate). poly(lauryl methacrylate). poly(phenyl methacrylate).<br>
poly(methyl acrylate), poly(isopropyl acrylate), poly(isobutyl acrylate). poly(octadecyl<br>
acrylate) polyethylene, polypropylene, poly(ethylene glycol), poly(ethylene oxide), poly<br>
(ethylene terephthalate), poly(vinyl acetate), polyvinyl chloride, polystyrene, polyvinyl<br>
pyrrolidone, pluronics and polyvinylphenol and copolymers thereof.<br>
Synthetically modified natural polymers of use in conjugates of the invention include,<br>
but are not limited to. alkyl celluloses, hydroxyalkyl celluloses, cellulose ethers, cellulose<br>
esters, and nitrocelluloses. Particularly preferred members of the broad classes of<br>
synthetically modified natural polymers include, but are not limited to, methyl cellulose,<br>
ethyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose, hydroxybutyl<br>
methyl cellulose, cellulose acetate, cellulose propionate, cellulose acetate butyrate, cellulose<br>
acetate phthalate, carboxymethyl cellulose, cellulose triacetate, cellulose sulfate sodium salt,<br>
and polymers of acrylic and methacrylic esters and alginic acid.<br>
These and the other polymers discussed herein can be readily obtained from<br>
commercial sources such as Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO.), Polysciences (Warrenton,<br>
PA.), Aldrich (Milwaukee, Wl.), Fluka (Ronkonkoma. NY), and BioRad (Richmond, CA), or<br>
else synthesized from monomers obtained from these suppliers using standard techniques.<br>
Representative biodegradable polymers of use in the conjugates of the invention<br>
include, but are not limited to, polylactides, polyglycolides and copolymers thereof,<br>
poly(ethylene terephthalate). poly(butyric acid), poly(valeric acid), poly(lactide-co-<br>
caprolactone), poly(lactide-co-glycolide), polyanhydrides, polyorthoesters, blends and<br>
copolymers thereof. Of particular use are compositions that form gels, such as those<br>
including collagen, pluronics and the like.<br>
The polymers of use in the invention include "hybrid' polymers that include water-<br>
insoluble materials having within at least a portion of their structure, a bioresorbable<br>
molecule. An example of such a polymer is one that includes a water-insoluble copolymer,<br>
which has a bioresorbable region, a hydrophilic region and a plurality of crosslinkable<br>
functional groups per polymer chain.<br>
For purposes of the present invention, "water-insoluble materials" includes materials<br>
that are substantially insoluble in water or water-containing environments. Thus, although<br>
certain regions or segments of the copolymer may be hydrophilic or even water-soluble, the<br>
polymer molecule, as a whole, does not to any substantial measure dissolve in water.<br>
For purposes of the present invention, the term "bioresorbable molecule" includes a<br>
region that is capable of being metabolized or broken down and resorbed and/or eliminated<br>
through normal excretory routes by the body. Such metabolites or break down products are<br>
preferably substantially non-toxic to the body.<br>
The bioresorbable region may be either hydrophobic or hydrophilic, so long as the<br>
copolymer composition as a whole is not rendered water-soluble. Thus, the bioresorbable<br>
region is selected based on the preference that the polymer, as a whole, remains water-<br>
insoluble. Accordingly, the relative properties, i.e., the kinds of functional groups contained<br>
by, and the relative proportions of the bioresorbable region, and the hydrophilic region are<br>
selected to ensure that useful bioresorbable compositions remain water-insoluble.<br>
Exemplary resorbable polymers include, for example, synthetically produced<br>
resorbable block copolymers of poly(a-hydroxy-carboxylic acid)/poly(oxyalkylene, (see.<br>
Cohn et al, U.S. Patent No. 4,826,945). These copolymers are not crosslinked and are water-<br>
soluble so that the body can excrete the degraded block copolymer compositions. See.<br>
Younes et al. J Biomed. Mater. Res. 21: 1301-1316 (1987); and Cohn et al. J Biomed.<br>
Mater. Res. 22: 993-1009 (1988).<br>
Presently preferred bioresorbable polymers include one or more components selected<br>
from poly(esters). poly(hydroxy acids), poly(lactones), poly(amides), poly(ester-amides).<br>
poly (amino acids), poly(anhydrides), poly(orthoesters), poly(carbonates).<br>
poly(phosphazines). poly(phosphoesters), poly(thioesters), polysaccharides and mixtures<br>
thereof. More preferably still, the biosresorbable polymer includes a poly(hydroxy) acid<br>
component. Of the poly(hydroxy) acids, polylactic acid, polyglycolic acid, polycaproic acid,<br>
polybutyric acid, polyvaleric acid and copolymers and mixtures thereof are preferred.<br>
In addition to forming fragments that are absorbed in vivo ("'bioresorbed"), preferred<br>
polymeric coatings for use in the methods of the invention can also form an excretable and/or<br>
metabolizable fragment.<br>
Higher order copolymers can also be used in the present invention. For example,<br>
Casey et al, U.S. Patent No. 4,438,253, which issued on March 20, 1984, discloses tri-block<br>
copolymers produced from the transesterification of poly(glycolic acid) and an hydroxyl-<br>
ended poly(alkylene glycol). Such compositions are disclosed for use as resorbable<br>
monofilament sutures. The flexibility of such compositions is controlled by the incorporation<br>
of an aromatic orthocarbonate, such as tetra-p-tolyl orthocarbonate into the copolymer<br>
structure.<br>
Other coatings based on lactic and/or glycolic acids can also be utilized. For example,<br>
Spinu, U.S. Patent No. 5,202,413, which issued on April 13, 1993. discloses biodegradable<br>
multi-block copolymers having sequentially ordered blocks of polylactide and/or<br>
polyglycolide produced by ring-opening polymerization of lactide and/or glycolide onto<br>
either an oligomeric diol or a diamine residue followed by chain extension with a di-<br>
functional compound, such as, a diisocyanate, diacylchloride or dichlorosilane.<br>
Bioresorbable regions of coatings useful in the present invention can be designed to<br>
be hydrolytically and/or enzymatically cleavable. For purposes of the present invention,<br>
"hydrolytically cleavable" refers to the susceptibility of the copolymer, especially the<br>
bioresorbable region, to hydrolysis in water or a water-containing environment. Similarly,<br>
"enzymatically cleavable" as used herein refers to the susceptibility of the copolymer,<br>
especially the bioresorbable region, to cleavage by endogenous or exogenous enzymes.<br>
When placed within the body, the hydrophilic region can be processed into excretable<br>
and/or metabolizable fragments. Thus, the hydrophilic region can include, for example,<br>
polyethers, polyalkylene oxides, polyols. polyvinyl pyrrolidine), polyvinyl alcohol),<br>
poly(alkyl oxazolincs). polysaccharides, carbohydrates, peptides, proteins and copolymers<br>
and mixtures thereof. Furthermore, the hydrophilic region can also be. for example, a<br>
poly(alkylene) oxide. Such poly(alkylene) oxides can include, for example, poly(ethylene)<br>
oxide, poly(propylene) oxide and mixtures and copolymers thereof.<br>
Polymers that are components of hydrogels are also useful in the present invention.<br>
Hydrogels are polymeric materials that are capable of absorbing relatively large quantities of<br>
water. Examples of hydrogel forming compounds include, but are not limited to, polyacrylic<br>
acids, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, polyvinyl alcohol, polyvinyl pyrrolidine, gelatin,<br>
carrageenan and other polysaccharides, hydroxyethylenemethacrylic acid (HEMA), as well as<br>
derivatives thereof, and the like. Hydrogels can be produced that are stable, biodegradable<br>
and bioresorbable. Moreover, hydrogel compositions can include subunits that exhibit one or<br>
more of these properties.<br>
Bio-compatible hydrogel compositions whose integrity can be controlled through<br>
crosslinking are known and are presently preferred for use in the methods of the invention.<br>
For example, Hubbell et al., U.S. Patent Nos. 5,410,016, which issued on April 25, 1995 and<br>
5,529,914, which issued on June 25, 1996, disclose water-soluble systems, which are<br>
crosslinked block copolymers having a water-soluble central block segment sandwiched<br>
between two hydrolytically labile extensions. Such copolymers are further end-capped with<br>
photopolymerizable acrylate functionalities. When crosslinked, these systems become<br>
hydrogels. The water soluble central block of such copolymers can include poly(ethylene<br>
glycol); whereas, the hydrolytically labile extensions can be a poly(a-hydroxy acid), such as<br>
polyglycolic acid or polylactic acid. See, Sawhney el al., Macromolecules 26: 581-587<br>
(1993).<br>
In another preferred embodiment, the gel is a thermoreversible gel. Thermoreversible<br>
gels including components, such as pluronics, collagen, gelatin, hyalouronic acid,<br>
polysaccharides, polyurethane hydrogel, polyurethane-urea hydrogel and combinations<br>
thereof are presently preferred.<br>
In yet another exemplary embodiment, the conjugate of the invention includes a<br>
component of a liposome. Liposomes can be prepared according to methods known to those<br>
skilled in the art, for example, as described in Eppstein el a/., U.S. Patent No. 4,522.811,<br>
which issued on June 11, 1985. For example, liposome formulations may be prepared by<br>
dissolving appropriate lipid(s) (such as stearoyl phosphatidyl ethanolamine, stearoyl<br>
phosphatidyl choline, arachadoyl phosphatidyl choline, and cholesterol) in an inorganic<br>
solvent that is then evaporated, leaving behind a thin film of dried lipid on the surface of the<br>
container. An aqueous solution of the active compound or its pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
salt is then introduced into the container. The container is then swirled by hand to free lipid<br>
material from the sides of the container and to disperse lipid aggregates, thereby forming the<br>
liposomal suspension.<br>
The above-recited microparticles and methods of preparing the microparticles arc<br>
offered by way of example and they are. not intended to define the scope of microparticles of<br>
use in the present invention. It will be apparent to those of skill in the art that an array of<br>
microparticles, fabricated by different methods, are of use in the present invention.<br>
c) Biomolecules<br>
In another preferred embodiment, the modified sugar bears a biomolecule. In still<br>
further preferred embodiments, the biomolecule is a functional protein, enzyme, antigen,<br>
antibody, peptide, nucleic acid (e.g., single nucleotides or nucleosides, oligonucleotides,<br>
polynucleotides and single- and higher-stranded nucleic acids), lectin, receptor or a<br>
combination thereof.<br>
Some preferred biomolecules are essentially non-fluorescent, or emit such a minimal<br>
amount of fluorescence that they are inappropriate for use as a fluorescent marker in an assay.<br>
Other biomolecules may be fluorescent. The use of an otherwise naturally occurring sugar<br>
that is modified by covalent attachment of another entity (e.g., PEG, biomolecule, therapeutic<br>
moiety, diagnostic moiety, etc.) is appropriate. In an exemplary embodiment, a sugar moiety,<br>
which is a biomolecule, is conjugated to a linker arm and the sugar-linker arm cassette is<br>
subsequently conjugated to a peptide via a method of the invention.<br>
Biomolecules useful in practicing the present invention can be derived from any<br>
source. The biomolecules can be isolated from natural sources or they can be produced by<br>
synthetic methods. Peptides can be natural peptides or mutated peptides. Mutations can be<br>
effected by chemical mutagenesis, site-directed mutagenesis or other means of inducing<br>
mutations known to those of skill in the art. Peptides useful in practicing the instant<br>
invention include, for example, enzymes, antigens, antibodies and receptors. Antibodies can<br>
be either polyclonal or monoclonal; either intact or fragments. The peptides are optionally<br>
the products of a program of directed evolution.<br>
Both naturally derived and synthetic peptides and nucleic acids are of use in<br>
conjunction with the present invention; these molecules can be attached to a sugar residue<br>
component or a crosslinking agent by any available reactive group. For example, peptides<br>
can be attached through a reactive amine, carboxyl, sulfhydryl, or hydroxyl group. The<br>
reactive group can reside at a peptide terminus or at a site internal to the peptide chain.<br>
Nucleic acids can be attached through a reactive group on a base (e.g., exocyclic amine) or an<br>
available hydroxyl group on a sugar moiety (e.g., 3'- or 5'-hydroxyl). The peptide and<br>
nucleic acid chains can be further derivatized at one or more sites to allow for the attachment<br>
of appropriate reactive groups onto the chain. See, Chrisey el al. Nucleic Acids Res. 24:<br>
3031-3039(1996).<br>
In a further preferred embodiment, the biomolecule is selected to direct the peptide<br>
modified by the methods of the invention to a specific tissue, thereby enhancing the delivery<br>
of the peptide to that tissue relative to the amount of underivatized peptide that is delivered to<br>
the tissue. In a still further preferred embodiment, the amount of derivatized peptide<br>
delivered to a specific tissue within a selected time period is enhanced by derivatization by at<br>
least about 20%, more preferably, at least about 40%, and more preferably still, at least about<br>
100%. Presently, preferred biomolecules for targeting applications include antibodies,<br>
hormones and ligands for cell-surface receptors. Exemplary targeting biomolecules include,<br>
but are not limited to. an antibody specific for the transferrin receptor for delivery of the<br>
molecule to the brain (Penichet et al., 1999, J. Immunol. 163:4421-4426; Pardridge, 2002.<br>
Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 513:397-430), a peptide that recognizes the vasculature of the prostate<br>
(Arap et al., 2002. PNAS 99:1527-1531), and an antibody specific for lung caveolae<br>
(Mcintosh et al. 2002, PNAS 99:1996-2001).<br>
In a presently preferred embodiment, the modifying group is a protein. In an<br>
exemplary embodiment, the protein is an interferon. The interferons are antiviral<br>
glycoproteins that, in humans, are secreted by human primary fibroblasts after induction with<br>
virus or double-stranded RNA. Interferons are of interest as therapeutics, e.g., antivirals and<br>
treatment of multiple sclerosis. For references discussing interferon-p, see, e.g., Yu, el al, J<br>

In an exemplary interferon conjugate, interferon ß is conjugated to a second peptide<br>
via a linker arm. The linker arm includes an intact glycosyl linking group through which it is<br>
attached to the second peptide via a method of the invention. The linker arm also optionally<br>
includes a second intact glycosyl linking group, through which it is attached to the interferon.<br>
In another exemplary embodiment, the invention provides a conjugate of follicle<br>
stimulating hormone (FSH). FSH is a glycoprotein hormone. See, for example, Saneyoshi,<br>
et al, Biol. Reprod, 65:1686-1690 (2001); Hakola, et al, J. Endocrinol, 158:441-448<br>

Boime. et al Recent Progress in Hormone Research, 34:271 -289 (1999); and Rafferty, et al,<br>
J. Endo.. 145:527-533 (1995). The ESH conjugate can be formed in a manner similar to thai<br>
described for interferon.<br>
In yet another exemplary embodiment, the conjugate includes erythropoietin (EPO).<br>
EPO is known to mediate response to hypoxia and to stimulate the production of red blood<br>
cells. For pertinent references, see, Cerami, et al, Seminars in Oncology, 28(2)(Suppl 8):66-<br>
70 (04/2001). An exemplary EPO conjugate is formed analogously to the conjugate of<br>
interferon.<br>
In a further exemplary embodiment, the invention provides a conjugate of human<br>
granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF). G-CSF is a glycoprotein that stimulates<br>
proliferation, differentiation and activation of neutropoietic progenitor cells into functionally<br>
mature neutrophils. Injected G-CSF is known to be rapidly cleared from the body. See, for<br>
example, Nohynek, et al. Cancer Chemother. Pharmacol.. 39:259-266 (1997): Lord, et al.<br>
Clinical Cancer Research, 7(7):2085-2090 (07/2001); Rotondaro, et al, Molecular<br>
Biotechnology, 11(2): 117-128 (1999); and Bonig, et al, Bone Marrow Transplantation,<br>
28:259-264 (2001). An exemplary conjugate of G-CSF is prepared as discussed above for<br>
the conjugate of the interferons. One of skill in the art will appreciate that many other<br>
proteins may be conjugated to interferon using the methods and compositions of the<br>
invention, including but not limited to, the peptides listed in Tables 7 and 8 (presented<br>
elsewhere herein) and Figure 28, and in Figures 29-57, where individual modification<br>
schemes are presented.<br>
In still a further exemplary embodiment, there is provided a conjugate with biotin.<br>
Thus, for example, a selectively biotinylated peptide is elaborated by the attachment of an<br>
avidin or streptavidin moiety bearing one or more modifying groups.<br>
In a further preferred embodiment, the biomolecule is selected to direct the peptide<br>
modified by the methods of the invention to a specific intracellular compartment, thereby<br>
enhancing the delivery of the peptide to that intracellular compartment relative to the amount<br>
of underivatized peptide that is delivered to the tissue. In a still further preferred<br>
embodiment, the amount of derivatized peptide delivered to a specific intracellular<br>
compartment within a selected time period is enhanced by derivatization by at least about<br>
20%, more preferably, at least about 40%, and more preferably still, at least about 100%. In<br>
another particularly preferred embodiment, the biomolecule is linked to the peptide by a<br>
cleavable linker that can hydrolyze once internalized. Presently, preferred biomolecules for<br>
intracellular targeting applications include transferrin, lactotransferrin (lactoferrin),<br>
melanotransferrin (p97), cerulopIasmin,.and divalent cation transporter, as well as antibodies<br>
directed against specific vascular targets. Contemplated linkages include, but are not limited<br>
to, protein-sugar-linker-sugar-protein, protein-sugar-linker-protein and multivalent forms<br>
thereof, and protein-sugar-linker-drug where the drug includes small molecules, peptides,<br>
lipids, among others.<br>
Site-specific and target-oriented delivery of therapeutic agents is desirable for the<br>
purpose of treating a wide variety of human diseases, such as different types of malignancies<br>
and certain neurological disorders. Such procedures are accompanied by fewer side effects<br>
and a higher efficiacy of drug. Various principles have been relied on in designing these<br>
del ivery systems. For a review, see Garnett, Advanced Drug Delivery Reviews 53:171 -216<br>
(2001).<br>
One important consideration in designing a drug delivery system to target tissues<br>
specifically. The discovery of tumor surface antigens has made it possible to develop<br>
therapeutic approaches where tumor cells displaying definable surface antigens are<br>
specifically targeted and killed. There are three main classes of therapeutic monoclonal<br>
antibodies (antibody) that have demonstrated effectiveness in human clinical trials in treating<br>
malignancies: (1) unconjugated MAb, which either directly induces growth inhibition and/or<br>
apoptosis, or indirectly activates host defense mechanisms to mediate antitumor cytotoxicity:<br>
(2) drug-conjugated MAb, which preferentially delivers a potent cytotoxic toxin to the tumor<br>
cells and therefore minimizes the systemic cytotoxicity commonly associated with<br>
conventional chemotherapy; and (3) radioisotope-conjugated MAb, which delivers a<br>
sterilizing dose of radiation to the tumor. See review by Reff et al., Cancer Control 9:152-<br>
166(2002).<br>
In order to arm MAbs with the power to kill malignant cells, the MAbs can be<br>
connected to a toxin, which may be obtained from a plant, bacterial, or fungal source, to form<br>
chimeric proteins called immunotoxins. Frequently used plant toxins are divided into two<br>
classes: (1) holotoxins (or class II ribosome inactivating proteins), such as ricin, abrin.<br>
mistletoe lectin, and modeccin, and (2) hemitoxins (class I ribosome inactivating proteins),<br>
such as pokeweed antiviral protein (PAP), saporin, Bryodin 1, bouganin, and gelonin.<br>
Commonly used bacterial toxins include diphtheria toxin (DT) and Pseudomonas exotoxin<br>
(PK). Kreitman, Current Pharmaceutical Biotechnology 2:313-325 (2001). Other toxins<br>
contemplated for use with the present invention include, but are not limited to, those in Table<br>
2.<br>
Conventional immunotoxins contain an MAb chemically conjugated to a toxin that is<br>
mutated or chemically modified to minimized binding to normal cells. Examples include<br>
anti-B4-blocked ricin, targeting CD5; and RFB4-deglycosyIated ricin A chain, targeting<br>
CD22. Recombinant immunotoxins developed more recently are chimeric proteins<br>
consisting of the variable region of an antibody directed against a tumor antigen fused to a<br>
protein toxin using recombinant DNA technology. The toxin is also frequently genetically<br>
modified to remove normal tissue binding sites but retain its cytotoxicity. A large number of<br>
differentiation antigens, overexpressed receptors, or cancer-specific antigens have been<br>
identified as targets for immunotoxins, e.g., CD 19, CD22, CD20, IL-2 receptor (CD25),<br>
CD33, IL-4 receptor. FGF receptor and its mutants, ErB2, Lewis carbohydrate, mesothelin,<br>
transferrin receptor, GM-CSF receptor, Ras, Bcr-Abl, and c-Kit, for the treatment of a variety<br>
of malignancies including hematopoietic cancers, glioma, and breast, colon, ovarian, bladder,<br>
and gastrointestinal cancers. See e.g., Brinkmann et al., Expert Opin. Biol. Ther. 1:693-702<br>
(2001); Perentesis and Sievers, Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America 15:677-701<br>
(2001).<br>
MAbs conjugated with radioisotope are used as another means of treating human<br>
malignancies, particularly hematopoietic malignancies, with a high level of specificity and<br>
effectiveness. The most commonly used isotopes for therapy are the high-energy -emitters,<br>
such as l3ll and 90Y. Recently, 213Bi-labeled anti-CD33 humanized MAb has also been tested<br>
in phase I human clinical trials. Reff et al., supra.<br>
A number of MAbs have been used for therapeutic purposes. For example, the use of<br>
rituximab (Rituxan™), a recombinant chimeric anti-CD20 MAb, for treating certain<br>
hematopoietic malignancies was approved by the FDA in 1997. Other MAbs that have since<br>
been approved for therapeutic uses in treating human cancers include: alemtuzumab<br>
(Campath-11 -I™), a humanized rat antibody against CD52; and gemtuzumab ozogamicin<br>
(Mylotarg™), a calicheamicin-conjugated humanized mouse antCD33 MAb. The FDA is<br>
also currently examining the safety and efficacy of several other MAbs for the purpose of<br>
site-specific delivery of cytotoxic agents or radiation, e.g.. radiolabeled Zevalin™ and<br>
Bexxar™. Reffet a I., supra.<br>
A second important consideration in designing a drug delivery system is the<br>
accessibility of a target tissue to a therapeutic agent. This is an issue of particular concern in<br>
the case of treating a disease of the central nervous system (CNS), where the blood-brain<br>
barrier prevents the diffusion of macromolecules. Several approaches have been developed<br>
to bypass the blood-brain barrier for effective delivery of therapeutic agents to the CNS.<br>
The understanding of iron transport mechanism from plasma to brain provides a<br>
useful tool in bypassing the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Iron, transported in plasma by<br>
transferrin, is an essential component of virtually all types of cells. The brain needs iron for<br>
metabolic processes and receives iron through transferrin receptors located on brain capillary<br>
endothelial cells via receptor-mediated transcytosis and endocytosis. Moos and Morgan,<br>
Cellular and Molecular Neurobiology 20:77-95 (2000). Delivery systems based on<br>
transferrin-transferrin receptor interaction have been established for the efficient delivery of<br>
peptides, proteins, and liposomes into the brain. For example, peptides can be coupled with a<br>
Mab directed against the transferrin receptor to achieve greater uptake by the brain, Moos and<br>
Morgan, Supra. Similarly, when coupled with an MAb directed against the transferrin<br>
receptor, the transportation of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) across the blood-brain<br>
barrier is enhanced. Song et al.. The Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental<br>
Therapeutics 301:605-610 (2002); Wu et al., Journal of Drug Targeting 10:239-245 (2002).<br>
In addition, a liposomal delivery system for effective transport of the chemotherapy drug,<br>
doxorubicin, into C6 glioma has been reported, where transferrin was attached to the distal<br>
ends of liposomal PEG chains. Eavarone et al., J. Biomed. Mater. Res. 51:10-14 (2000). A<br>
number of US patents also relate to delivery methods bypassing the blood-brain barrier based<br>
on transferrin-transferrin receptor interaction. See e.g., US Patent Nos. 5,154,924;<br>
5.182.107; 5,527,527: 5,833,988; 6,015,555.<br>
There are other suitable conjugation partners for a pharmaceutical agent to bypass the<br>
blood-brain barrier. For example, US Patent Nos. 5,672,683, 5,977,307 and WO 95/02421<br>
relate to a method of delivering a neuropharmaceutical agent across the blood-brain barrier,<br>
where the agent is administered in the form of a fusion protein with a ligand that is reactive<br>
with a brain capillary endothelial cell receptor; WO 99/00150 describes a drug delivery<br>
system in which the transportation of a drug across the blood-brain barrier is facilitated by<br>
conjugation with an MAb directed against human insulin receptor; WO 89/10134 describes a<br>
chimeric peptide, which includes a peptide capable of crossing the blood brain barrier at a<br>
relatively high rate and a hydrophilic neuropeptide incapable of transcytosis, as a means of<br>
introducing hydrophilic neuropeptides into the brain; WO 01/60411 Al provides a<br>
pharmaceutical composition that can easily transport a pharmaceutically active ingredient<br>
into the brain. The active ingredient is bound to a hibernation-specific protein that is used as<br>
a conjugate, and administered with a thyroid hormone or a substance promoting thyroid<br>
hormone production. In addition, an alternative route of drug delivery for bypassing the<br>
blood-brain barrier has been explored. For instance, intranasal delivery of therapeutic agents<br>
without the need for conjugation has been shown to be a promising alternative delivery<br>
method (Frey, 2002, Drug Delivery Technology, 2(5):46-49).<br>
In addition to facilitating the transportation of drugs across the blood-brain barrier,<br>
transferrin-transferrin receptor interaction is also useful for specific targeting of certain tumor<br>
cells, as many tumor cells overexpress transferrin receptor on their surface. This strategy has<br>
been used for delivering bioactive macromolecules into K562 cells via a transferrin conjugate<br>
(Wellhoner et al., The Journal of Biological Chemistry 266:4309-4314 (1991)), and for<br>
delivering insulin into enterocyte-like Caco-2 cells via a transferrin conjugate (Shah and<br>
Shen, Journal of Pharmaceutical Sciences 85:1306-1311 (1996)).<br>
Furthermore, as more becomes known about the functions of various iron transport<br>
proteins, such as lactotransferrin receptor, melanotransferrin, ceruloplasmin, and Divalent<br>
Cation Transporter and their expression pattern, some of the proteins involved in iron<br>
transport mechanism(e.g., melanotransferrin), or their fragments, have been found to be<br>
similarly effective in assisting therapeutic agents transport across the blood-brain barrier or<br>
targeting specific tissues (WO 02/13843 A2, WO 02/13873 A2). For a review on the use of<br>
transferrin and related proteins involved in iron uptake as conjugates in drug delivery, see Li<br>
and Qian, Medical Research Reviews 22:225-250 (2002).<br>
The concept of tissue-specific delivery of therapeutic agents goes beyond the<br>
interaction between transferrin and transferrin receptor or their related proteins. For example,<br>
a bone-specific delivery system has been described in which proteins are conjugated with a<br>
bone-seeking aminobisphosphate for improved delivery of proteins to mineralized tissue.<br>
Uludag and Yang, Biotechnol. Prog. 18:604-611 (2002). For a review on this topic, see Vyas<br>
ct al., Critical Reviews in Therapeutic Drug Carrier System 18:1 -76 (2001).<br>
A variety of linkers may be used in the process of generating bioconjugates for the<br>
purpose of specific delivery of therapeutic agents,. Suitable linkers include homo- and<br>
heterobifunctional cross-linking reagents, which may be cleavable by, e.g., acid-catalyzed<br>
dissociation, or non-cleavable {see, e.g., Srinivasachar and Neville, Biochemistry 28:2501-<br>
2509 (1989); Wellhoner et al., The Journal of Biological Chemistry 266:4309-4314 (1991)).<br>
Interaction between many known binding partners, such as biotin and avidin/streptavidin, can<br>
also be used as a means to join a therapeutic agent and a conjugate partner that ensures the<br>
specific and effective delivery of the therapeutic agent. Using the methods of the invention,<br>
proteins may be used to deliver molecules to intracellular compartments as conjugates.<br>
Proteins, peptides, hormones, cytokines, small molecules or the like that bind to specific cell<br>
surface receptors that are internalized after ligand binding may be used for intracellular<br>
targeting of conjugated therapeutic compounds. Typically, the receptor-ligand complex is<br>
internalized into intracellular vesicles that are delivered to specific cell compartments,<br>
including, but not limited to, the nucleus, mitochondria, golgi, ER, lysosome, and endosome.<br>
depending on the intracellular location targeted by the receptor. By conjugating the receptor<br>
ligand with the desired molecule, the drug will be carried with the receptor-ligand complex<br>
and be delivered to the intracellular compartments normally targeted by the receptor. The<br>
drug can therefore be delivered to a specific intracellular location in the cell where it is<br>
needed to treat a disease.<br>
Many proteins may be used to target therapeutic agents to specific tissues and organs.<br>
Targeting proteins include, but are not limited to, growth factors (EPO, HGH. HGF, nerve<br>
growth factor, FGF, among others), cytokines (GM-CSF, G-CSF, the interferon family,<br>
interleukins, among others), hormones (FSH, LH, the steroid families, estrogen.<br>
corticosteroids, insulin, among others), serum proteins (albumin, lipoproteins, fetoprotein,<br>
human serum proteins, antibodies and fragments of antibodies, among others), and vitamins<br>
(folate, vitamin C, vitamin A, among others). Targeting agents are available that are specific<br>
for receptors on most cells types.<br>
Contemplated linkage configurations include, but are not limited to, protein-sugar-<br>
linker-sugar-protein and multivalent forms thereof, protein-sugar-linker-protein and<br>
multivalent forms thereof, protein-sugar-linker-therapeutic agent, where the therapeutic agent<br>
includes, but are not limited to, small molecules, peptides and lipids. In some embodiments,<br>
a hydrolysable linker is used that can be hydrolyzed once internalized. An acid labile linker<br>
can be used to advantage where the protein conjugate is internalized into the endosomes or<br>
lysosomes which have an acidic pH. Once internalized into the endosome or lysosome, the<br>
linker is hydrolyzed and the therapeutic agent is released from the targeting agent.<br>
In an exemplary embodiment, transferrin is conjugated via a linker to an enzyme or a<br>
nucleic acid vector that encoded the enzyme desired to be targeted to a cell that presents<br>
transferrin receptors in a patient. The patient could, for example, require enzyme<br>
replacement therapy for that particular enzyme. In particularly preferred embodiments, the<br>
enzyme is one that is lacking in a patient with a lysosomal storage disease (see Table 5).<br>
Once in circulation, the transferrin-enzyme conjugate is linked to transferrin receptors and is<br>
internalized in early endosomes (Xing et al., 1998, Biochem. J. 336:667; Li et al., 2002,<br>
Trends in Pharmcol. Sci. 23:206; Suhaila et al., 1998, J. Biol. Chem. 273:14355). Other<br>
contemplated targeting agents that are related to transferrin include, but are not limited to,<br>
lactotransferrin (lactoferrin), melanotransferrin (p97), ceruloplasmin, and divalent cation<br>
transporter.<br>
In another exemplary embodiment, transferrin-dystrophin conjugates would enter<br>
endosomes by the transferrin pathway. Once there, the dystrophin is released due to a<br>
hydrolysable linker which can then be taken to the intracellular compartment where it is<br>
required. This embodiment may be used to treat a patient with muscular dystrophy by<br>
supplementing a genetically defective dystrophin gene and/or protein with the functional<br>
dystrophin peptide connected to the transferrin.<br>
E. Therapeutic Moieties<br>
In another preferred embodiment, the modified sugar includes a therapeutic moiety.<br>
Those of skill in the art will appreciate that there is overlap between the category of<br>
therapeutic moieties and biomolecules; many biomolecules have therapeutic properties or<br>
potential.<br>
The therapeutic moieties can be agents already accepted for clinical use or they can be<br>
drugs whose use is experimental, or whose activity or mechanism of action is under<br>
investigation. The therapeutic moieties can have a proven action in a given disease state or<br>
can be only hypothesized to show desirable action in a given disease state. In a preferred<br>
embodiment, the therapeutic moieties are compounds, which are being screened for their<br>
ability to interact with a tissue of choice. Therapeutic moieties, which are useful in practicing<br>
the instant invention include drugs from a broad range of drug classes having a variety of<br>
pharmacological activities. In some embodiments, it is preferred to use therapeutic moieties<br>
that are not sugars. An exception to this preference is the use of a sugar that is modified by<br>
covalent attachment of another entity, such as a PEG, biomolecule, therapeutic moiety,<br>
diagnostic moiety and the like. In an exemplary embodiment, an antisense nucleic acid<br>
moeity is conjugated to a linker arm which is attached to the targeting moiety. In another<br>
exemplary embodiment, a therapeutic sugar moiety is conjugated to a linker arm and the<br>
sugar-linker arm cassette is subsequently conjugated to a peptide via a method of the<br>
invention.<br>
Methods of conjugating therapeutic and diagnostic agents to various other species are<br>
well known to those of skill in the art. See, for example Hermanson, Bioconjugate<br>
Techniques, Academic Press, San Diego, 1996; and Dunn et al, Eds. Polymeric Drugs<br>
And Drug Delivery Systems, ACS Symposium Series Vol. 469, American Chemical<br>
Society. Washington, D.C. 1991.<br>
In an exemplary embodiment, the therapeutic moiety is attached to the modified sugar<br>
via a linkage that is cleaved under selected conditions. Exemplary conditions include, but are<br>
not limited to, a selected pH (e.g., stomach, intestine, endocytotic vacuole), the presence of<br>
an active enzyme (e.g., esterase, protease, reductase, oxidase), light, heat and the like. Many<br>
cleavable groups are known in the art. See, for example, Jung et al, Biochem. Biophys. Acta,<br>

F. Preparation of Modified Sugars<br>
Modified sugars useful in forming the conjugates of the invention are discussed<br>
herein. The discussion focuses on preparing a sugar modified with a water-soluble polymer<br>
for clarity of illustration. In particular, the discussion focuses on the preparation of modified<br>
sugars that include a poly(cthylene glycol) moiety. Those of skill will appreciate that the<br>
methods set forth herein are broadly applicable to the preparation of modified sugars,<br>
therefore, the discussion should not be interpreted as limiting the scope of the invention.<br>
In general, the sugar moiety and the modifying group are linked together through the<br>
use of reactive groups, which are typically transformed by the linking process into a new-<br>
organic functional group or unreactive species. The sugar reactive functional group(s), is<br>
located at any position on the sugar moiety. Reactive groups and classes of reactions useful<br>
in practicing the present invention are generally those that are well known in the art of<br>
bioconjugate chemistry. Currently favored classes of reactions available with reactive sugar<br>
moieties are those, which proceed under relatively mild conditions. These include, but are<br>
not limited to nucleophilic substitutions (e.g., reactions of amines and alcohols with acyl<br>
halides, active esters), electrophilic substitutions {e.g., enamine reactions) and additions to<br>
carbon-carbon and carbon-heteroatom multiple bonds (e.g., Michael reaction, Diels-Alder<br>
addition). These and other useful reactions are discussed in, for example, Smith and March,<br>
Advanced Organic Chemistry, 5th Ed., John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York, 2001;<br>
Hermanson, Bioconjugate Techniques, Academic Press, San Diego, 1996; and Feeney et<br>
al. Modification of Proteins; Advances in Chemistry Series, Vol. 198, American<br>
Chemical Society, Washington, D.C., 1982.<br>
Useful reactive functional groups pendent from a sugar nucleus or modifying group<br>
include, but are not limited to:<br>
(a) carboxyl groups and various derivatives thereof including, but not limited to,<br>
N-hydroxysuccinimide esters, N-hydroxybenzotriazole esters, acid halides, acyl imidazoles,<br>
thioesters, p-nitrophenyl esters, alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl and aromatic esters;<br>
(b) hydroxyl groups, which can be converted to, e.g., esters, ethers, aldehydes, etc.<br>
(c) haloalkyl groups, wherein the halide can be later displaced with a nucleophilic<br>
group such as, for example, an amine, a carboxylate anion, thiol anion, carbanion, or an<br>
alkoxide ion, thereby resulting in the covalent attachment of a new group at the functional<br>
group of the halogen atom;<br>
(d) dienophile groups, which are capable of participating in Diels-Alder reactions<br>
such as, for example, maleimido groups;<br>
(e) aldehyde or ketone groups, such that subsequent derivatization is possible via<br>
formation of carbonyl derivatives such as, for example, imines, hydra/ones, semicarba/oncs<br>
or oximes, or via such mechanisms as Grignard addition or alkyllithium addition;<br>
(f) sulfonyl halide groups for subsequent reaction with amines, for example, to form<br>
sulfonamides;<br>
(g) thiol groups, which can be, for example, converted to disulfides or reacted with<br>
alkyl and acyl halides:<br>
(h) amine or sulfhydryl groups, which can be, for example, acylated, alkylated or<br>
oxidized;<br>
(i) alkenes, which can undergo, for example, cycloadditions, acylation, Michael<br>
addition, etc: and<br>
(j) epoxides, which can react with, for example, amines and hydroxy! compounds.<br>
The reactive functional groups can be chosen such that they do not participate in. or<br>
interfere with, the reactions necessary to assemble the reactive sugar nucleus or modifying<br>
group. Alternatively, a reactive functional group can be protected from participating in the<br>
reaction by the presence of a protecting group. Those of skill in the art understand how to<br>
protect a particular functional group such that it does not interfere with a chosen set of<br>
reaction conditions. For examples of useful protecting groups, see, for example, Greene el<br>
al., Protectivf. Groups in Organic Synthesis, John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York, 1991.<br>
In the discussion that follows, a number of specific examples of modified sugars that<br>
are useful in practicing the present invention are set forth. In the exemplary embodiments, a<br>
sialic acid derivative is utilized as the sugar nucleus to which the modifying group is<br>
attached. The focus of the discussion on sialic acid derivatives is for clarity of illustration<br>
only and should not be construed to limit the scope of the invention. Those of skill in the art<br>
will appreciate that a variety of other sugar moieties can be activated and derivatized in a<br>
manner analogous to that set forth using sialic acid as an example. For example, numerous<br>
methods are available for modifying galactose, glucose, N-acetylgalactosamine and fucose to<br>
name a few sugar substrates, which are readily modified by art recognized methods. See, for<br>
example, Elhalabi et al., Curr. Med. Chem. 6: 93 (1999); and Schafer et al., J. Org. Chem.<br>
65: 24 (2000).<br>
In an exemplary embodiment, the peptide that is modified by a method of the<br>
invention is a peptide that is produced in mammalian cells (e.g., CHO cells) or in a transgenic<br>
animal and thus, contains N- and/or O-linked oligosaccharide chains, which are incompletely<br>
sialylated. The oligosaccharide chains of the glycopeptide lacking a sialic acid and<br>
containing a terminal galactose residue can be PEGylated, PPGylated or otherwise modified<br>
with a modified sialic acid.<br>
In Scheme 4. the mannosaminc glycoside 1, is treated with the active ester of a<br>
protected amino acid (e.g., glycine) derivative, converting the sugar amine residue into the<br>
corresponding protected amino acid amide adduct. The adduct is treated with an aldolase to<br>
form the sialic acid 2. Compound 2 is converted to the corresponding CMP derivative by the<br>
action of CMP-SA synthetase, followed by catalytic hydrogenation of the CMP derivative to<br>
produce compound 3. The amine introduced via formation of the glycine adduct is utilized as<br>
a locus of PEG or PPG attachment by reacting compound 3 with an activated PEG or PPG<br>
derivative (e.g., PEG-C(0)NHS, PPG-C(O)NHS), producing 4 or 5, respectively.<br>
Table 3 sets forth representative examples of sugar monophosphates that are<br>
derivatized with a PEG or PPG moiety. Certain of the compounds of Table 3 are prepared by<br>
the method of Scheme 1. Other derivatives are prepared by art-recognized methods. See. for<br>
example. Keppler et al.. Glycobiology 11: 11R (2001); and Charter et al.. Glycobiology 10:<br>
1049 (2000)). Other amine reactive PEG and PPG analogues are commercially available, or<br>
they can be prepared by methods readily accessible to those of skill in the art.<br>
Table 3. Examples of sugar monophosphates that are derivatized with a PEG or PPG<br>
moiety<br><br>
The modified sugar phosphates of use in practicing the present invention can be<br>
substituted in other positions as well as those set forth above, "i" may be Na or another salt<br>
and "i" may be interchangeable with Na. Presently preferred substitutions of sialic acid arc<br>
set forth in Formula 5.<br><br>
in which X is a linking group, which is preferably selected from -O-, -N(H)-, -S,<br>
CH2-. and N(R)2, in which each R is a member independently selected from R'-R5. "i" may<br>
be Na or another salt, and Na may be interchangeable with "i:The symbols Y, Z, A and B<br>
each represent a group that is selected from the group set forth above for the identity of X. X.<br>
Y, Z, A and B are each independently selected and, therefore, they can be the same or<br>
different. The symbols R1, R2, R3, R4 and R5 represent H, polymers, a water-soluble polymer,<br>
therapeutic moiety, biomolecule or other moiety. The symbol R6 represents H, OH, or a<br>
polymer. Alternatively, these symbols represent a linker that is linked to a polymer, water-<br>
soluble polymer, therapeutic moiety, biomolecule or other moiety.<br>
In another exemplary embodiment, a mannosamine is simultaneously acylated and<br>
activated for a nucleophilic substitution by the use of chloroacetic anhydride as set forth in<br>
Scheme 5. In each of the schemes presented in this section, i-4 or Na+ can be interchangeable,<br>
wherein the salt can be sodium, or can be any other suitable salt.<br><br>
The resulting chloro-derivatized glycan is contacted with pyruvate in the presence of an<br>
aldolase, forming a chloro-derivatized sialic acid. The corresponding nucleotide sugar is<br>
prepared by contacted the sialic acid derivative with an appropriate nucleotide triphosphates<br>
and a synthetase. The chloro group on the sialic acid moiety is then displaced with a<br>
nucleophilic PFG derivative, such as thio-PEG.<br>
In a further exemplary embodiment, as shown is Scheme 6, a mannosamine is<br>
acylated with a bis-HOBT dicarboxylate, producing the corresponding amido-alkyl-<br>
carboxylic acid, which is subsequently converted to a sialic acid derivative. The sialic acid<br>
derivative is converted to a nucleotide sugar, and the carboxylic acid is activated and reacted<br>
with a nucleophilic PEG derivative, such as amino-PEG.<br><br>
In another exemplary embodiment, set forth in Seheme 7, amine- and carboxyl-<br>
proteeted neuraminic acid is activated by converting the primary hydroxyl group to the<br>
corresponding p-toluenesulfonate ester, and the methyl ester is cleaved. The activated<br>
neuraminic acid is converted to the corresponding nucleotide sugar, and the activating group<br>
is displaced by a nucleophilic PEG species, such as thio-PEG.<br><br>
in yet a further exemplary embodiment, as set forth in Scheme 8, the primary<br>
hydroxyl moiety of an amine- and carboxyl-protected neuraminic acid derivative is alkylated<br>
using an electrophilic PEG, such as chloro-PEG. The methyl ester is subsequently cleaved<br>
and the PEG-sugar is converted to a nucleotide sugar.<br><br>
Glycans other than sialic acid can be derivatized with PEG using the methods set forth<br>
herein. The derivatized glycans. themselves, are also within the scope of the invention.<br>
Thus, Scheme 9 provides an exemplary synthetic route to a PEGylated galactose nucleotide<br>
sugar. The primary hydroxy! group of galactose is activated as the corresponding<br>
toluenesulfonate ester, which is subsequently converted to a nucleotide sugar.<br><br>
Scheme 10 sets forth an exemplary route for preparing a galactose-PEG derivative<br>
that is based upon a galactose-6-amine moiety. Thus, galactosamine is converted to a<br>
nucleotide sugar, and the amine moiety of galactosamine is functional ized with an active<br>
PliG derivative.<br><br>
Scheme I 1 provides another exemplary route to galactose derivatives. The starting<br>
point for Scheme 1 1 is galactose-2-amine. which is converted to a nucleotide sugar. The<br>
amine moiety of the nucleotide sugar is the locus for attaching a PEG derivative, such as<br>
Methoxy-PEG (mPEG) carboxylic acid.<br><br>
Exemplary moieties attached to the conjugates disclosed herein include, but are not<br>
limited to. PFG derivatives (e.g.. acyl-PEG, acyl-alkyl-PEG. alkyl-acyl-PEG carbamoyl-<br>
Pl-G, aryl-PEG. alkyl-PEG), PPG derivatives (e.g., acyl-PPG, acyl-alkyl-PPG, alkyl-acyl-<br>
PPG carbamoyl-PPG. aryl-PPG). polyapartic acid, polyglutamate, polylysine, therapeutic<br>
moieties, diagnostic moieties, mannose-6-phosphate, heparin, heparan, SLe mannose.<br>

keratan, dermatan, dextran, modified dextran, amylose, bisphosphate, poly-SA, hyaluronic<br>
acid, keritan. albumin, integrins, antennary oligosaccharides, peptides and the like. Methods<br>
of conjugating the various modifying groups to a saccharide moiety are readily accessible to<br>
those of skill in the art (POLY (ETHYLENE GLYCOL CHEMISTRY : BlOTECllNlCAL and<br>

Purification of sugars, nucleotide sugars and derivatives<br>
The nucleotide sugars and derivatives produced by the above processes can be used<br>
without purification. However. it is usually preferred to recover the product. Standard, well-<br>
known techniques for recovery of glycosylated saccharides such as thin or thick layer<br>
chromatography, column chromatography, ion exchange chromatography, or membrane<br>
filtration can be used. It is preferred to use membrane filtration, more preferably utilizing a<br>
reverse osmotic membrane, or one or more column chromatographic techniques for the<br>
recovery as is discussed hereinafter and in the literature cited herein. For instance, membrane<br>
filtration wherein the membranes have molecular weight cutoff of about 3000 to about 10.000<br>
can be used to remove proteins for reagents having a molecular weight of less than 10,000<br>
Da.. Membrane filtration or reverse osmosis can then be used to remove salts and/or purify<br>
the product saccharides (see, e.g., WO 98/15581). Nanofilter membranes are a class of<br>
reverse osmosis membranes that pass monovalent salts but retain polyvalent salts and<br>
uncharged solutes larger than about 100 to about 2,000 Daltons, depending upon the<br>
membrane used. Thus, in a typical application, saccharides prepared by the methods of the<br>
present invention will be retained in the membrane and contaminating salts will pass through.<br>
G. Cross-linking Groups<br>
Preparation of the modified sugar for use in the methods of the present invention<br>
includes attachment of a modifying group to a sugar residue and forming a stable adduct.<br>
which is a substrate for a glycosyltransferase. Thus, it is often preferred to use a cross-<br>
linking agent to conjugate the modifying group and the sugar. Exemplary Afunctional<br>
compounds which can be used for attaching modifying groups to carbohydrate moieties<br>
include, but are not limited to, Afunctional polyethylene glycols), polyamides, polyethcrs.<br>
polyesters and the like. General approaches for linking carbohydrates to other molecules are<br>
known in the literature. See, for example, Lee et al.. Biochemistry 28: 1856 (1989): Bhatia<br>
et al.. Anal. Binchem. 178: 408 (1989): Janda et al.,./. Am. Chem. Soc: 112: 8886 (1990) and<br>
Bcdnarski et al. WO 92/18135. In the discussion that follows, the reactive groups are treated<br>
as benign on the sugar moiety of the nascent modified sugar. The focus of the discussion is<br>
for clarity of illustration. Those of skill in the art will appreciate that the discussion is<br>
relevant to reactive groups on the modifying group as well.<br>
An exemplary strategy involves incorporation of a protected sulthydryl onto the sugar<br>
using the heterobifunctional crosslinker SPDP (n-succinimidyl-3-(2-pyridyldithio)propionatc<br>
and then deprotecting the sulfhydryl for formation of a disulfide bond with another sulfhydryl<br>
on the modi lying group.<br>
If SPDP detrimentally affects the ability of the modified sugar to act as a<br>
glycosyltransferase substrate, one of an array of other crosslinkers such as 2-iminothiolane or<br>
N-succinimidyl S-acetylthioacetate (SATA) is used to form a disulfide bond. 2-<br>
iminothiolane reacts with primary amines, instantly incorporating an unprotected sulfhydryl<br>
onto the amine-containing molecule. SATA also reacts with primary amines, but<br>
incorporates a protected sulfhydryl. which is later deacetylated using hydroxylamine to<br>
produce a free sulfhydryl. In each case, the incorporated sulfhydryl is free to react with other<br>
sulfhydryls or protected sulfhydryl. like SPDP, forming the required disulfide bond.<br>
The above-described strategy is exemplary, and not limiting, of linkers of use in the<br>
invention. Other crosslinkers are available that can be used in different strategies for<br>
crosslinking the modifying group to the peptide. For example, TPCH(S-(2-thiopyridyl)-L-<br>
cysteine hydrazide and TPMPH ((S-(2-thiopyridyl) mercapto-propionohydrazide) react with<br>
carbohydrate moieties that have been previously oxidized by mild periodate treatment, thus<br>
forming a hydrazone bond between the hydrazide portion of the crosslinker and the periodate<br>
generated aldehydes. TPCH and TPMPH introduce a 2-pyridylthione protected sulfhydryl<br>
group onto the sugar, which can be deprotected with DTT and then subsequently used for<br>
conjugation, such as forming disulfide bonds between components.<br>
If disulfide bonding is found unsuitable for producing stable modified sugars, other<br>
crosslinkers may be used that incorporate more stable bonds between components. The<br>
heterobifunctional crosslinkers GMBS (N-gama-malimidobutyryloxy)succinimide) and<br>
SMCC (succinimidyl 4-(N-rnaleirnido-methyl)cyclohexane) react with primary amines, thus<br>
introducing a maleimide group onto the component. The maleimide group can subsequently<br>
react with sulthydry is on the other component, which can be introduced by previously<br>
mentioned crosslinkers. thus forming a stable thioether bond between the components. If<br>
steric hindrance between components interferes with either component's activity or the ability<br>
of the modified sugar to act as a glycosyltransferase substrate, crosslinkers can be used which<br>
introduce long spacer arms between components and include derivatives of some of the<br>
previously mentioned crosslinkers (i.e.. SPDP). Thus, there is an abundance of suitable<br>
crosslinkers, which are useful; each of which is selected depending on the effects it has on<br>
optimal peptide conjugate and modified sugar production.<br>
A variety of reagents are used to modify the components of the modified sugar with<br>
intramolecular chemical crosslinks (lor reviews of crosslinking reagents and crosslinking<br>
procedures see: Wold. F.. Meth. Enzymol. 25: 623-651, 1972; Weetall, H. H., and Cooney. D.<br>
A.. In: Fn/ymf.s as Drugs. (Holcenberg, and Roberts, eds.) pp. 395-442, Wiley, New York.<br>
1981; Ji, T. H., Meth. Enzymol. 91: 580-609, 1983; Mattson el al., Mol. Biol. Rep. 17: 167-<br>
183. 1993, all of which are incorporated herein by reference). Preferred crosslinking reagents<br>
are derived from various zero-length, homo-bifunctional, and hetero-bifunctional crosslinking<br>
reagents. Zero-length crosslinking reagents include direct conjugation of two intrinsic<br>
chemical groups with no introduction of extrinsic material. Agents that catalyze formation of<br>
a disulfide bond belong to this category. Another example is reagents that induce<br>
condensation of a carboxyl and a primary amino group to form an amide bond such as<br>
carbodiimides, ethylchloroformaie. Woodward's reagent K (2-ethyl-5-phenylisoxazolium-3'-<br>
sulfonate), and carbonyldiimidazole. In addition to these chemical reagents, the enzyme<br>
transglutaminase (glutamyl-peptide ?-glutamyltransferase; EC 2.3.2.13) may be used as zero-<br>
length crosslinking reagent. This enzyme catalyzes acyl transfer reactions at carboxamide<br>
groups of protein-linked glutaminyl residues, usually with a primary amino group as<br>
substrate. Preferred homo- and hetero-bifunctional reagents contain two identical or two<br>
dissimilar sites, respectively, which may be reactive for amino, sulfhydryl, guanidino, indole,<br>
or nonspecific groups.<br>
2. Preferred Specific Sites in Crosslinking Reagents<br>
a. Amino-Reactive Groups<br>
In one preferred embodiment, the sites on the cross-linker are amino-reactive groups.<br>
Useful non-limiting examples of amino-reactive groups include N-hydroxysuccinimide<br>
(NHS) esters, imidoestcrs. isocyanates, acylhalides, arylazides. p-nitrophenyl esters,<br>
aldehydes, and sulfonyl chlorides.<br>
NHS esters react preferentially with the primary (including aromatic) amino groups of<br>
a modified sugar component. The imidazole groups of hislidincs are known to compete with<br>
primary amines for reaction, but the reaction products are unstable and readily hydrolyzed.<br>
The reaction involves the nucleophilic attack of an amine on the acid carboxyl of an NHS<br>
ester to form an amide, releasing the N-hydroxysuccinimide. Thus, the positive charge of the<br>
original amino group is lost.<br>
Imidoesters are the most specific acylating reagents for reaction with the amine<br>
groups of the modified sugar components. At a pH between 7 and 10, imidoesters react only<br>
with primary amines. Primary amines attack imidates nucleophilically to produce an<br>
intermediate that breaks down to amidine at high pH or to a new imidate at low pH. The new<br>
imidate can react with another primary amine, thus crosslinking two amino groups, a case of<br>
a putatively monofunctional imidate reacting bifunctionally. The principal product of<br>
reaction with primary amines is an amidine that is a stronger base than the original amine.<br>
The positive charge of the original amino group is therefore retained.<br>
lsocyanates (and isothiocyanates) react with the primary amines of the modified sugar<br>
components to form stable bonds. Their reactions with sulfhydryl, imidazole, and tyrosyl<br>
groups give relatively unstable products.<br>
Acylazides are also used as amino-specific reagents in which nucleophilic amines of<br>
the affinity component attack acidic carboxyl groups under slightly alkaline conditions, e.g.<br>
pH 8.5.<br>
Arylhalides such as 1.5-difluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene react preferentially with the<br>
amino groups and tyrosine phenolic groups of modified sugar components, but also with<br>
sulfhydryl and imidazole groups.<br>
p-Nitrophenyl esters of mono- and dicarboxylic acids arc also useful amino-reactive<br>
groups. Although the reagent specificity is not very high, a- and e-amino groups appear to<br>
react most rapidly.<br>
Aldehydes such as glutaraldehyde react with primary amines of modified sugar.<br>
Although unstable Schiff bases are formed upon reaction of the amino groups with the<br>
aldehydes of the aldehydes, glutaraldehyde is capable of modifying the modified sugar with<br>
stable crosslinks. At pH 6-8, the pH of typical crosslinking conditions, the cyclic polymers<br>
undergo a dehydration to form a-ß unsaturated aldehyde polymers. Schiff bases, however.<br>
are stable, when conjugated to another double bond. The resonant interaction of both double<br>
bonds prevents hydrolysis of the Schiff linkage. Furthermore, amines at high local<br>
concentrations can attack the cthylcnic double bond to form a stable Michael addition<br>
product.<br>
Aromatic sullbnyl chlorides react with a variety oi'sites of the modified sugar<br>
components, but reaction with the amino groups is the most important, resulting in a stable<br>
sulfonamide linkage.<br>
b. Sulfhydryl-Reactive Groups<br>
In another preferred embodiment, the sites arc sulfhydryl-reactive groups. Useful,<br>
non-limiting examples of sulfhydryl-reactive groups include maleimides, alkyl halides.<br>
pyridyl disulfides, and thiophthalimides.<br>
Maleimides react preferentially with the sulfhydryl group of the modified sugar<br>
components to form stable thioether bonds. They also react at a much slower rate with<br>
primary amino groups and the imidazole groups of histidines. However, at pH 7 the<br>
maleimide group can be considered a sulfhydryl-specific group, since at this pH the reaction<br>
rate of simple thiols is 1000-fold greater than that of the corresponding amine.<br>
Alkyl halides react with sulfhydryl groups, sulfides, imidazoles, and amino groups.<br>
At neutral to slightly alkaline pH, however, alkyl halides react primarily with sulfhydryl<br>
groups to form stable thioether bonds. At higher pH, reaction with amino groups is favored.<br>
Pyridyl disulfides react with free sulfhydryls via disulfide exchange to give mixed<br>
disulfides. As a result, pyridyl disulfides are the most specific sulfhydryl-reactive groups.<br>
Thiophthalimides react with free sulfhydryl groups to form disulfides.<br>
c. Carboxyl-Reactive Residue<br>
In another embodiment, carbodiimides soluble in both water and organic solvent, are<br>
used as carboxyl-reactive reagents. These compounds react with free carboxyl groups<br>
forming a pscudourea that can then coupled to available amines yielding an amide linkage.<br>
Procedures to modify a carboxyl group with carbodiimide is well know in the art (see,<br>
Yamada et al., Biochemistry 20: 4836-4842, 1981).<br>
3. Preferred Nonspecific Sites in Crosslinking Reagents<br>
In addition to the use of site-specific reactive moieties, the present invention<br>
contemplates the use of non-specific reactive groups to link the sugar to the modifying group.<br>
Exemplary non-specific cross-linkers include photoactivatable groups, completely<br>
inert in the dark, which arc converted to reactive species upon absorption of a photon of<br>
appropriate energy. In one preferred embodiment, photoactivatable groups are selected from<br>
precursors of nitrcnes generated upon heating or photolysis of azides. Electron-deficient<br>
nitrenes are extremely reactive and can react with a variety of chemical bonds including N-H,<br>
O-H. C-H, and C-C. Although three types of azides (aryl, alkyl, and acyl derivatives) may<br>
be employed, arylazidcs are presently preferred. The reactivity of arylazides upon photolysis<br>
is better with N-H and O-H than C-H bonds. Electron-deficient arylnitrenes rapidly ring-<br>
expand to form dehydroazepines, which tend to react with nucleophiles, rather than form C-l I<br>
insertion products. The reactivity of arylazides can be increased by the presence of electron-<br>
withdrawing substituents such as nitro or hydroxyl groups in the ring. Such substituents push<br>
the absorption maximum of arylazides to longer wavelength. Unsubstituted arylazides have<br>
an absorption maximum in the range of 260-280 nm, while hydroxy and nitroarylazides<br>
absorb significant light beyond 305 nm. Therefore, hydroxy and nitroarylazides are most<br>
preferable since they allow to employ less harmful photolysis conditions for the affinity<br>
component than unsubstituted arylazides.<br>
In another preferred embodiment, photoactivatable groups are selected from<br>
Chlorinated arylazides. The photolysis products of fluorinated arylazides are arylnitrenes. all<br>
of which undergo the characteristic reactions of this group, including C-H bond insertion,<br>
with high efficiency (Keana eta!., J. Org. Chem. 55: 3640-3647, 1990).<br>
In another embodiment, photoactivatable groups are selected from benzophenone<br>
residues. Benzophenone reagents generally give higher crosslinking yields than arylazide<br>
reagents.<br>
In another embodiment, photoactivatable groups are selected from diazo compounds,<br>
which form an electron-deficient carbene upon photolysis. These carbenes undergo a variety<br>
of reactions including insertion into C-H bonds, addition to double bonds (including aromatic<br>
systems), hydrogen attraction and coordination to nucleophilic centers to give carbon ions.<br>
In still another embodiment, pholoactivatable groups are selected from<br>
diazopyruvates. For example, the p-nitrophenyl ester of p-nitrophenyl diazopyruvate reacts<br>
with aliphatic amines to give diazopyruvic acid amides that undergo ultraviolet photolysis to<br>
form aldehydes. The photolyzed diazopyruvate-modified affinity component will react like<br>
formaldehyde or glutaraldehyde forming crosslinks.<br>

5. HeteroBifunctional Reagents<br>
a. Amino-Reactive HeteroBifunctional Reagents with a Pyridyl<br>
Disulfide Moiety<br>
Synthesis, properties, and applications of such reagents are described in the literature<br>
(for reviews of crosslinking procedures and reagents, see above). Many of the reagents are<br>
commercially available (e.g.. Pierce Chemical Company. Rockford, III.: Sigma Chemical<br>
Company. St. Louis. Mo.; Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR).<br>

disulfide moiety and an ami no-reactive NHS ester include N-succinimidyl-3-(2-<br>

Pomato et al. U.S. Patent No. 5,965,106. It is within the abilities of one of skill in the art to<br>
choose an appropriate cross-linking agent for a particular application.<br>
d. Cleavable Linker Groups<br>
In yet a further embodiment, the linker group is provided with a group that can be<br>
cleaved to release the modifying group from the sugar residue. Many cleavable groups are<br>
known in the art. See. for example. Jung et al.. Biochem. Biophys. Acta 761: 152-162 (108.1):<br>
Joshi et al.. J. Biol. Chem. 265: 14518-14525 (1990); Zarling et al.. J. Immunol. 124: 913-920<br>
(1980): Houizar et al.. Eur. J. Biochem. 155: 141-147(1986); Park et al., J. Biol. Chem. 261:<br>
205-210 (1986); Browning et al., J. Immunol. 143: 1859-1867(1989). Moreover a broad<br>
range of cleavable, bifunctional (both homo- and hetero-bifunctional) linker groups is<br>
commercially available from suppliers such as Pierce.<br>
Exemplary cleavable moieties can be cleaved using light, heat or reagents such as<br>
thiols, hydroxylamine, bases, periodate and the like. Moreover, certain preferred groups are<br>
cleaved in vivo in response to being endocytosed (e.g., cis-aconityl; sec, Shen et al., Biochem.<br>
Biophys. Res. Commun. 102: 1048 (1991)). Preferred cleavable groups comprise a cleavable<br>
moiety which is a member selected from the group consisting of disulfide, ester, imide.<br>
carbonate, nitrobenzyl, phenacyl and benzoin groups.<br>
e. Conjugation of Modified Sugars to Peptides<br>
The modified sugars are conjugated to a glycosylated or non-glycosylated peptide<br>
using an appropriate enzyme to mediate the conjugation. Preferably, the concentrations of<br>
the modified donor sugar(s), enzyme(s) and acceptor peptide(s) are selected such that<br>
glycosylation proceeds until the acceptor is consumed. The considerations discussed below,<br>
while set forth in the context of a sialyltransferase, are generally applicable to other<br>
glycosyltransfcrase reactions.<br>
A number of methods of using glycosyltransferases to synthesize desired<br>
oligosaccharide structures are known and are generally applicable to the instant invention.<br>
Exemplary methods are described, for instance, WO 96/32491. Ito et al.. Pure Appl. Chem.<br>
65: 753 (1993), and U.S. Pat.Nos. 5,352,670, 5,374,541, and 5,545,553.<br>
The present invention is practiced using a single glycosyltransferase or a combination<br>
of glyeosyluansferases. For example, one can use a combination of a sialyltransferase and a<br>
galactosyltransferase. In those embodiments using more than one enzyme, the enzymes and<br>
substrates are preferably combined in an initial reaction mixture, or the enzymes and reagents<br>
for a second enzymatic reaction are added to the reaction medium once the first enzymatic<br>
reaction is complete or nearly complete. By conducting two enzymatic reactions in sequence<br>
in a single vessel, overall yields are improved over procedures in which an intermediate<br>
species is isolated. Moreover, cleanup and disposal of extra solvents and by-products is<br>
reduced.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, each of the first and second enzyme is a<br>
glycosyltransferase. In another preferred embodiment, one enzyme is an endoglycosidase. In<br>
another preferred embodiment, one enzyme is an exoglycosidase. In an additional preferred<br>
embodiment, more than two enzymes are used to assemble the modified glycoprotein of the<br>
invention. The enzymes are used to alter a saccharide structure on the peptide at any point<br>
either before or alter the addition of the modified sugar to the peptide.<br>
In another embodiment, at least two of the enzymes are glycosyltransferases and the<br>
last sugar added to the saccharide structure of the peptide is a non-modified sugar. Instead,<br>
the modified sugar is internal to the glycan structure and therefore need not be the ultimate<br>
sugar on the glycan. In an exemplary embodiment, galactosyltransferase may catalyze the<br>
transfer of Gal-PEG from UDP-Gal-PEG onto the glycan, followed by incubation in the<br>
presence of ST3Gal3 and CMP-SA, which serves to add a "capping" unmodified sialic acid<br>
onto the glycan (Figure 23A).<br>
In another embodiment, at least two of the enzymes used are glycosyltransferases. and<br>
at least two modified sugars are added to the glycan structures on the peptide. In this manner,<br>
two or more different glycoconjugates may be added to one or more glycans on a peptide.<br>
This process generates glycan structures having two or more functionally different modified<br>
sugars. In an exemplary embodiment, incubation of the peptide with GnT-I. II and UDP-<br>
GlcNAc-PFG serves to add a GlcNAc-PFG molecule to the glycan; incubation with<br>
galactosyltransferase and UDP-Gal then serves to add a Gal residue thereto; and, incubation<br>
with ST3Gal3 and CMP-SA-Man-6-Phosphate serves to add a SA-mannose-6-phosphate<br>
molecule to the glycan. This series of reactions results in a glycan chain having the<br>
functional characteristics of a PFGylated glycan as well as mannose-6-phosphate targeting<br>
activity (Figure 23B).<br>
In another embodiment, at least two of the enzymes used in the reaction are<br>
glycosyltransferases, and again, different modified sugars are added to N-linked and O-<br>
linked glycans on the peptide. This embodiment is useful when two different modified<br>
sugars are to be added to the glycans of a peptide, but when it is important to spatially<br>
separate the modified sugars on the peptide from each other. For example, if the modified<br>
sugars comprise bulky molecules, including but not limited to, PEG and other molecules such<br>
as a linker molecule, this method may be preferable. The modified sugars may be added<br>
simultaneously to the glycan structures on a peptide, or they may be added sequentially. In<br>
an exemplary embodiment, incubation with ST3Gal3 and CMP-SA-PEG serves to add sialic<br>
acid-PEG to the N-linked glycans, while incubation with ST3Gall and CMP-SA-<br>
bisPhosphonate serves to add sialic acid-BisPhosphonate to the O-linked glycans (Figure<br>
23C).<br>
In another embodiment, the method makes use of one or more exo- or<br>
endogKcosidasc. The glycosidase is typically a mutant, which is engineered to form gl\cos\l<br>
bonds rather than rupture them. The mutant glycanase, sometimes called a glycosynthase.<br>
typically includes a substitution of an amino acid residue for an active site acidic amino acid<br>
residue. For example, when the endoglycanase is endo-H, the substituted active site residues<br>
will typically be Asp at position 130, Glu at position 132 or a combination thereof. The<br>
amino acids are generally replaced with serine, alanine, asparagine, or glutamine.<br>
Exoglycosidases such as transialylidase arc also useful.<br>
The mutant enzyme catalyzes the reaction, usually by a synthesis step that is<br>
analogous to the reverse reaction of the endoglycanase hydrolysis step. In these<br>
embodiments, the glycosyl donor molecule (e.g., a desired oligo- or mono-saccharide<br>
structure) contains a leaving group and the reaction proceeds with the addition of the donor<br>
molecule to a GlcNAc residue on the protein. For example, the leaving group can be a<br>
halogen, such as fluoride. In other embodiments, the leaving group is a Asn, or a Asn-<br>
peptidc moiety. In yet further embodiments, the GlcNAc residue on the glycosyl donor<br>
molecule is modified. For example, the GlcNAc residue may comprise a 1,2 oxazoline<br>
moiety.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, each of the enzymes utilized to produce a conjugate of the<br>
invention are present in a catalytic amount. The catalytic amount of a particular enzyme<br>
varies according to the concentration of that enzyme's substrate as well as to reaction<br>
conditions such as temperature, time and pH value. Means for determining the catalytic<br>
amount for a given enzyme under preselected substrate concentrations and reaction<br>
conditions are well known to those of skill in the art.<br>
The temperature at which an above-described process is carried out can range from<br>
just above freezing to the temperature at which the most sensitive enzyme denatures.<br>
Preferred temperature ranges are about 0 °C to about 55 °C, and more preferably about 20 ºC<br>
to about 37 °C. In another exemplary embodiment, one or more components of the present<br>
method are conducted at an elevated temperature using a thermophilic enzyme.<br>
The reaction mixture is maintained for a period of time sufficient for the acceptor to<br>
be glycosylated, thereby forming the desired conjugate. Some of the conjugate can often be<br>
detected after a few hours, with recoverable amounts usually being obtained within 24 hours<br>
or less. Those of skill in the art understand that the rate of reaction is dependent on a number<br>
of variable factors (e.g. enzyme concentration, donor concentration, acceptor concentration,<br>
temperature, solvent volume), which are optimized for a selected system.<br>
The present invention also provides for the industrial-scale production of modified<br>
peptides. As used herein, an industrial scale generally produces at least one gram of finished,<br>
purified conjugate.<br>
In the discussion that follows, the invention is exemplified by the conjugation of<br>
modified sialic acid moieties to a glycosylated peptide. The exemplary modified sialic acid is<br>
labeled with PEG. The focus of the following discussion on the use of PEG-modified sialic<br>
acid and glycosylated peptides is for clarity of illustration and is not intended to imply that<br>
the invention is limited to the conjugation of these two partners. One of skill understands that<br>
the discussion is generally applicable to the additions of modified glycosyl moieties other<br>
than sialic acid. Moreover, the discussion is equally applicable to the modification of a<br>
glycosyl unit with agents other than PEG including other water-soluble polymers, therapeutic<br>
moieties, and biomolecules.<br>
An enzymatic approach can be used for the selective introduction of PEGylated or<br>
PPGylated carbohydrates onto a peptide or glycopeptide. The method utilizes modified<br>
sugars containing PEG, PPG. or a masked reactive functional group, and is combined with<br>
the appropriate glycosyltransferase or glycosynthase. By selecting the glycosyltransferase<br>
that will make the desired carbohydrate linkage and utilizing the modified sugar as the donor<br>
substrate, the PEG or PPG can be introduced directly onto the peptide backbone, onto<br>
existing sugar residues of a glycopeptide or onto sugar residues that have been added to a<br>
peptide.<br>
An acceptor for the sialyltransferase is present on the peptide to be modified by the<br>
methods of the present invention either as a naturally occurring structure or one placed there<br>
recombinantly. enzymaticalk or chemically. Suitable acceptors, include, for example,<br>
galactosyl acceptors such as Ga1ß1,4GlcNAe, Ga1ß1,4GalNAc, Galß1,3GalNAc, lacto-N-<br>
tetraose, Galpl,3GlcNAc, Galß1Ara, Galßl,6GlcNAc, Ga1ß1,4Glc (lactose), and other<br>
acceptors known to those of skill in the art (.see, e.g., Paulson el ah, J. Biol. Chem. 253: 5617-<br>
5624(1978)).<br>
In one embodiment, an acceptor for the sialyltransferase is present on the peptide to<br>
be modified upon in vivo synthesis of the peptide. Such peptides can be sialylated using the<br>
claimed methods without prior modification of the glycosylation pattern of the peptide.<br>
Alternatively, the methods of the invention can be used to sialylate a peptide that does not<br>
include a suitable acceptor; one first modifies the peptide to include an acceptor by methods<br>
known to those of skill in the art. In an exemplary embodiment, a GalNAc residue is added<br>
by the action of a GalNAc transferase.<br>
In an exemplary embodiment, the galactosyl acceptor is assembled by attaching a<br>
galactose residue to an appropriate acceptor linked to the peptide, e.g., a GIcNAc. The<br>
method includes incubating the peptide to be modified with a reaction mixture that contains a<br>
suitable amount of a galactosyltransferase (e.g., galß1,3 or gaißi ,4). and a suitable galactosyl<br>
donor (e.g.. UDP-galactose). The reaction is allowed to proceed substantially to completion<br>
or. alternatively, the reaction is terminated when a preselected amount of the galactose<br>
residue is added. Other methods of assembling a selected saccharide acceptor will be<br>
apparent to those of skill in the art.<br>
In yet another embodiment, peptide-linked oligosaccharides are first "trimmed,"<br>
either in whole or in part, to expose either an acceptor for the sialyltransferase or a moiety to<br>
which one or more appropriate residues can be added to obtain a suitable acceptor. Enzymes<br>
such as glycosyltransferases and endoglycosidases (.see, for example U.S. Patent No.<br>
5.716,812) are useful for the attaching and trimming reactions. A detailed discussion of<br>
"trimming" and remodeling N-linked and O-linked glycans is provided elsewhere herein.<br>
In the discussion that follows, the method of the invention is exemplified by the use of<br>
modified sugars having a water-soluble polymer attached thereto. The focus of the<br>
discussion is for clarity of illustration. Those of skill will appreciate that the discussion is<br>
equally relevant to those embodiments in which the modified sugar bears a therapeutic<br>
moiety, biomolecule or the like.<br>
An exemplary embodiment of the invention in which a carbohydrate residue is<br>
"trimmed'" prior to the addition of the modified sugar is set forth in Figure 14, which sets<br>
forth a scheme in which high mannose is trimmed back to the first generation biantennary<br>
structure. A modified sugar bearing a water-soluble polymer is conjugated to one or more of<br>
the sugar residues exposed by the "trimming back." In one example, a water-soluble polymer<br>
is added via a GlcNAc moiety conjugated to the water-soluble polymer. The modified<br>
GlcNAc is attached to one or both of the terminal mannose residues of the biantennary<br>
structure. Alternatively, an unmodified GlcNAc can be added to one or both of the termini of<br>
the branched species.<br>
In another exemplary embodiment, a water-soluble polymer is added to one or both of<br>
the terminal mannose residues of the biantennary structure via a modified sugar having a<br>
galactose residue, which is conjugated to a GlcNAc residue added onto the terminal mannose<br>
residues. Alternatively, an unmodified Gal can be added to one or both terminal GlcNAc<br>
residues.<br>
In yet a further example, a water-soluble polymer is added onto a Gal residue using a<br>
modified sialic acid.<br>
Another exemplary embodiment is set forth in Figure 15, which displays a scheme<br>
similar to that shown in Figure 14, in which the high mannose structure is "trimmed back"' to<br>
the mannose from which the biantennary structure branches. In one example, a water-soluble<br>
polymer is added via a GlcNAc modified with the polymer. Alternatively, an unmodified<br>
GlcNAc is added to the mannose, followed by a Gal with an attached water-soluble polymer.<br>
In yet another embodiment, unmodified GlcNAc and Gal residues are sequentially added to<br>
the mannose. followed by a sialic acid moiety modified with a water-soluble polymer.<br>
Figure 16 sets forth a further exemplary embodiment using a scheme similar to that<br>
shown in Figure 14, in which high mannose is "trimmed back" to the GlcNAc to which the<br>
first mannose is attached. The GlcNAc is conjugated to a Gal residue bearing a water-soluble<br>
polymer. Alternatively, an unmodified Gal is added to the GlcNAc, followed by the addition<br>
of a sialic acid modified with a water-soluble sugar. In yet a further example, the terminal<br>
GlcNAc is conjugated with Gal and the GlcNAc is subsequently fucosylated with a modified<br>
fucose bearing a water-soluble polymer.<br>
Figure 17 is a scheme similar to that shown in Figure 14. in which high mannose is<br>
trimmed back to the first GlcNAc attached to the Asn of the peptide. In one example, the<br>
GlcNAc of the GlcNAc-(Fuc)a residue is conjugated with a GlcNAc bearing a water soluble<br>
polymer. In another example, the GlcNAc of the GlcNAc-(Fuc)a residue is modified with<br>
Gal. which bears a water soluble polymer. In a still further embodiment, the GlcNAc is<br>
modified with Gal. followed by conjugation to the Gal of a sialic acid modified with a water-<br>
soluble polymer.<br>
Other exemplary embodiments are set forth in Figures 18-22. An illustration of the<br>
array of reaction types with which the present invention may be practiced is provided in each<br>
of the aforementioned figures.<br>
The Examples set forth above provide an illustration of the power of the methods set<br>
fort h herein. Using the methods of the invention, it is possible to "trim back" and build up a<br>
carbohydrate residue of substantially any desired structure. The modified sugar can be added<br>
to the termini of the carbohydrate moiety as set forth above, or it can be intermediate between<br>
the peptide core and the terminus of the carbohydrate.<br>
In an exemplary embodiment, an existing sialic acid is removed from a glycopeptide<br>
using a sialidase, thereby unmasking all or most of the underlying galactosyl residues.<br>
Alternatively, a peptide or glycopeptide is labeled with galactose residues, or an<br>
oligosaccharide residue that terminates in a galactose unit. Following the exposure of or<br>
addition of the galactose residues, an appropriate sialyltransferase is used to add a modified<br>
sialic acid. The approach is summarized in Scheme 12.<br>
In yet a further approach, summarized in Scheme 13, a masked reactive functionality is present on the sialic acid. The masked reactive group is preferably unaffected by the<br>
conditions used to attach the modified sialic acid to the peptide. After the covalenl<br>
attachment of the modified sialic acid to the peptide, the mask is removed and the peptide is<br>
conjugated with an agent such as PEG, PPG, a therapeutic moiety, biomolecule or other<br>
agent. The agent is conjugated to the peptide in a specific manner by its reaction with the unmasked reactive group on the modified sugar residue.<br>
Any modified sugar can be used with its appropriate glycosyltransferase, depending<br>
on the terminal sugars of the oligosaccharide side chains of the glycopcptidc (Table 4). As<br>
discussed above, the terminal sugar of the glycopeptide required for introduction of the<br>
PL-lGylated or PPGylated structure can be introduced naturally during expression or it can be<br>
produced post expression using the appropriate glycosidase(s), glycosyltransferase(s) or mix<br>
of glycosidase(s) and gKcosyltransferasc(s).<br>
In a further exemplary embodiment, UDP-galactose-PEG is reacted with bovine milk<br>
ß l.4-galactosyltransferase. thereby transferring the modified galactose to the appropriate<br>
terminal N-acetylglucosamine structure. The terminal GlcNAc residues on the glycopeptide<br>
may be produced during expression, as may occur in such expression systems as mammalian,<br>
insect, plant or fungus, but also can be produced by treating the glycopeptide with a sialydase<br>
and/or glycosidase and/or glycosyltransferase, as required.<br>
In another exemplary embodiment, a GlcNAc transferase, such as GnT-I-I V, is<br>
utilized to transfer PEGylated-GlcNc to a mannose residue on a glycopeptide. In a still<br>
further exemplary embodiment, the N- and/or O-linked glycan structures are enzymaticaily<br>
removed from a glycopeptide to expose an amino acid or a terminal glycosyl residue that is<br>
subsequently conjugated with the modified sugar. For example, an endoglycanase is used to<br>
remove the N-linked structures of a glycopeptide to expose a terminal GlcNAc as a GlcNAc-<br>
linked-Asn on the glycopeptide. UDP-Gal-PEG and the appropriate galactosyltransferase is<br>
used to introduce the PEG- or PPG-galactose functionality onto the exposed GlcNAc.<br>
In an alternative embodiment, the modified sugar is added directly to the peptide<br>
backbone using a glycosyltransferase known to transfer sugar residues to the peptide<br>
backbone. This exemplary embodiment is set forth in Scheme 14. Exemplary<br>
glycosyltransferascs useful in practicing the present invention include, but are not limited to,<br>
GaINAc transferases (GalNAc Tl-14), GlcNAc transferases, fucosyltransferases.<br>
glucosyltransferases, xylosyltransferases, mannosyltransferases and the like. Use of this<br>
approach allows the direct addition of modified sugars onto peptides that lack any<br>
carbohydrates or, alternatively, onto existing glycopeptides. In both cases, the addition of the<br>
modified sugar occurs at specific positions on the peptide backbone as defined by the<br>
substrate specificity of the glycosyltransferase and not in a random manner as occurs during<br>
modification of a protein's peptide backbone using chemical methods. An array of agents<br>
can be introduced into proteins or glycopeptides that lack the glycosyltransferase substrate<br>
peptide sequence by engineering the appropriate amino acid sequence into the peptide chain.<br>
In each of the exemplary embodiments set forth above, one or more additional<br>
chemical or enzymatic modification steps can be utilized following the conjugation of the<br>
modified sugar to the peptide. In an exemplary embodiment, an enzyme (e.g..<br>
fucosyltransferase) is used to append a glycosyl unit (e.g., fucose) onto the terminal modified<br>
sugar attached to the peptide. In another example, an enzymatic reaction is utilized to "cap"<br>
sites to which the modified sugar failed to conjugate. Alternatively, a chemical reaction is<br>
utilized to alter the structure of the conjugated modified sugar. For example, the conjugated<br>
modified sugar is reacted with agents that stabilize or destabilize its linkage with the peptide<br>
component to which the modified sugar is attached. In another example, a component of the<br>
modified sugar is deprotected following its conjugation to the peptide. One of skill will<br>
appreciate that there is an array of enzymatic and chemical procedures that are useful in the<br>
methods of the invention at a stage after the modified sugar is conjugated to the peptide.<br>
Further elaboration of the modified sugar-peptide conjugate is within the scope of the<br>
invention.<br>
Peptide Targeting With Mannose-6-Phosphate<br>
In an exemplary embodiment the peptide is derivatized with at least one mannose-6-<br>
phosphate moiety. The mannose-6-phosphate moiety targets the peptide to a lysosome of a<br>
cell, and is useful, for example, to target therapeutic proteins to Iysosomcs for therapy of<br>
lysosomal storage diseases.<br>
Lysosomal storage diseases are a group of over 40 disorders which are the result of<br>
defects in genes encoding enzymes that break down glycolipid or polysaccharide waste<br>
products within the lysosomes of cells. The enzymatic products, e.g., sugars and lipids, are<br>
then recycled into new products. Each of these disorders results from an inherited autosomal<br>
or X-linked recessive trait which affects the levels of enzymes in the lysosome. Generally,<br>
there is no biological or functional activity of the affected enzymes in the cells and tissues of<br>
affected individuals. Table 5 provides a list of representative storage diseases and the<br>
enzymatic defect associated with the diseases. In such diseases the deficiency in enzyme<br>
function creates a progressive systemic deposition of lipid or carbohydrate substrate in<br>
lysosomes in cells in the body, eventually causing loss of organ function and death. The<br>
genetic etiology, clinical manifestations, molecular biology and possibility of the lysosomal<br>
storage diseases are detailed in Scriver et al., eds., The Metabolic and Molecular Basis<br>
of Inherited Disease, 7.sup.th Ed., Vol. II, McGraw Hill, (1995).<br>
Table 5. Lysosomal storage diseases and associated enzymatic defects<br>
De Duve first suggested that replacement of the missing lysosomal enzyme with<br>
exogenous biologically active enzyme might be a viable approach to treatment of lysosomal<br>
storage diseases (De Duve, Fed. Proc. 23: 1045 (1964). Since that time, various studies have<br>
suggested that enzyme replacement therapy may be beneficial for treating various lysosomal<br>
storage diseases. The best success has been shown with individuals with type 1 Gaucher<br>
disease, who have been treated with exogenous enzyme (P-glucocerebrosidase). prepared<br>
from placenta (Ceredase™) or, more recently, recombinantly (Cerezyme™). It has been<br>
suggested that enzyme replacement may also be beneficial for treating Fabry's disease, as<br>
well as other lysosomal storage diseases. See. for example, Dawson et al., Ped. Res. 7(8):<br>
684-690 (1973) (in vitro) and Mapes et al., Science 169: 987 (1970) (in vivo). Clinical trials<br>
of enzyme replacement therapy have been reported for Fabry patients using infusions of<br>
normal plasma (Mapes et al., Science 169: 987-989 (1970)), a-galactosidase A purified from<br>
placenta (Brady et al., N. Eng. J. Med. 279: 1163 (1973)); or a-galactosidase A purified from<br>
spleen or plasma (Desnick et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., USA 76: 5326-5330 (1979)) and have<br>
demonstrated the biochemical effectiveness of direct enzyme replacement for Fabry disease.<br>
These studies indicate the potential for eliminating, or significantly reducing, the pathological<br>
glycolipid storage by repeated enzyme replacement. For example, in one study (Desnick et al. supra), intravenous injection of purified enzyme resulted in a transient reduction in the<br>
plasma levels of the stored lipid substrate, globotriasylceramide.<br>
Accordingly, there exists a need in the art for methods for providing sufficient<br>
quantities of biologically active lysosomal enzymes, such as human a-galactosidase A, to<br>
deficient cells. Recently, recombinant approaches have attempted to address these needs, see.<br>
e.g.. U.S. Pat. No. 5.658.567; 5.580.757: Bishop et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.. USA. 83: 4859-<br>
4863 (1986); Medin et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., USA. 93: 7917-7922 (1996); Novo, P. J.,<br>
dene Therapy. 4: 488-492 (1997): Ohshima et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.. USA. 94: 2540-<br>
2544 (! 997); and Sugimoto el ai. Human Gene Therapy 6: 905-915,(1995). Through the<br>
mannose-6-phosphate mediated targeting of therapeutic peptides to lysosomes, the present<br>
invention provides compositions and methods for delivering sufficient quantities of<br>
biologically active lysosomal peptides to deficient cells.<br>
Thus, in an exemplary embodiment, the present invention provides a peptide<br>
according to Table 7 that is dcrivatized with mannose-6-phosphate (Figure 24 and Figure 25).<br>
The peptide may be recombinantly or chemically prepared. Moreover, the peptide can be the<br>
full, natural sequence, or it may be modified by, for example, truncation, extension, or it may<br>
include substitutions or deletions. Exemplary proteins that are remodeled using a method of<br>
the present invention include glucocerebrosidase, [3-glucosidase, a-galactosidase A, acid-u-<br>
glucosidase (acid maltase). Representative modified peptides that are in clinical use include,<br>
but are not limited to, Ceredasc™, Cerezyme™, and Fabryzyme™. A glycosyl group on<br>
modified and clinically relevant peptides may also be altered utilizing a method of the<br>
invention. The mannose-6-phosphate is attached to the peptide via a glycosyl linking group.<br>
In an exemplary embodiment, the glycosyl linking group is derived from sialic acid.<br>
Exemplary sialic acid-derived glycosyl linking groups are set forth in Table 3, in which one<br>
or more of the "R" moieties is mannose-6-phosphate or a spacer group having one or more<br>
mannose-6-phosphate moieties attached thereto. The modified sialic acid moiety is<br>
preferably the terminal residue of an oligosaccharide linked to the surface of the peptide<br>
(Figure 26)<br>
In addition to the mannose-6-phosphale. the peptides of the invention may be further<br>
derivati/ed with a moiety such as a water-soluble polymer, a therapeutic moiety, or an<br>
additional targeting moiety. Methods for attaching these and other groups are set forth<br>
herein. In an exemplary embodiment, the group other than mannose-6-phosphate is attached<br>
to the peptide via a derivatized sialic acid derivative according to Table 3, in which one or<br>
more of the "R" moieties is a group other than mannose-6-phosphate.<br>
In an exemplary embodiment, a sialic acid moiety modified with a Cbz-protected<br>
glycine-based linker arm is prepared. The corresponding nucleotide sugar is prepared and the<br>
Cbz group is removed by catalytic hydrogenation. The resulting nucleotide sugar has an<br>
available, reactive amine that is contacted with an activated mannose-6-phosphate derivative,<br>
providing a mannose-6-phosphate derivatized nucleotide sugar that is useful in practicing the<br>
methods of the invention.<br>
As shown in the scheme below (scheme 15), an exemplary activated mannose-6-<br>
phosphate derivative is formed by converting a 2-bromo-benzyl-protected phosphotriester<br>
into the corresponding triflate, in situ, and reacting the triflate with a linker having a reactive<br>
oxygen-containing moiety, forming an ether linkage between the sugar and the linker. The<br>
benzyl protecting groups are removed by catalytic hydrogenation, and the methyl ester of the<br>
linker is hydrolyzed, providing the corresponding carboxylic acid. The carboxylic acid is<br>
activated by any method known in the art. An exemplary activation procedure relies upon the<br>
conversion of the carboxylic acid to the N-hydroxysuccinimide ester.<br>
In another exemplary embodiment, as shown in the scheme below (scheme 16), a N-acetylated sialic acid is converted to an amine by manipulation of the pyruvyl<br>
moiety. Thus, the primary hydroxyl is converted to a sulfonate ester and reacted with sodium<br>
azide. The azide is catalytically reduced to the corresponding amine. The sugar is<br>
subsequently converted to its nucleotide analogue and coupled, through the amine group, to<br>
the linker arm-derivatized mannose-6-phosphate prepared as discussed above.<br><br>
Peptides useful to treat lysosomal storage disease can be derivatized with other<br>
targeting moieties including, but not limited to, transferrin (to deliver the peptide across the<br>
blood-brain barrier, and to endosomes), carnitine (to deliver the peptide to muscle cells), and<br>
phosphonates, e.g, bisphosphonate (to target the peptide to bone and other calciierous<br>
tissues). The targeting moiety and therapeutic peptide are conjugated by any method<br>
discussed herein or otherwise known in the art.<br>
In an exemplary embodiment, the targeting agent and the therapeutic peptide are<br>
coupled via a linker moiety. In this embodiment, at least one of the therapeutic peptide or the<br>
targeting agent is coupled to the linker moiety via an intact glycosyl linking group according<br>
to a method of the invention. In an exemplary embodiment, the linker moiety includes a<br>
poly(ether) such as poly(ethylene glycol). In another exemplary embodiment, the linker<br>
moiety includes at least one bond that is degraded in vivo, releasing the therapeutic peptide<br>
from the targeting agent, following delivery of the conjugate to the targeted tissue or region<br>
of the body.<br>
In yet another exemplary embodiment, the in vivo distribution of the therapeutic<br>
moiety is altered via altering a glycoform on the therapeutic moiety without conjugating the<br>
therapeutic peptide to a targeting moiety. For example, the therapeutic peptide can be<br>
shunted away from uptake by the reticuloendothelial system by capping a terminal galactose<br>
moiety of a glycosyl group with sialic acid (or a derivative thereof) (Figures 24 and 27).<br>
Sialylation to cover terminal Gal avoids uptake of the peptide by hepatic asialoglycoprotein<br>
(ASGP) receptors, and may extend the half life of the peptide as compared with peptides<br>
having only complex glycan chains, in the absence of sialylation.<br>
11. Peptide/Glycopeptides of the Invention<br>
In one embodiment, the present invention provides a composition comprising multiple<br>
copies of a single peptide having an elemental trimannosyl core as the primary glycan<br>
structure attached thereto. In preferred embodiments, the peptide may be a therapeutic<br>
molecule. The natural form of the peptide may comprise complex N-linked glycans or may<br>
be a high mannose glycan. The peptide may be a mammalian peptide, and is preferably a<br>
human peptide. In some embodiments the peptide is selected from the group consisting of an<br>
immunoglobulin, erythropoietin, tissue-type activator peptide, and others (See Figure 28).<br>
Exemplary peptides whose glycans can be remodeled using the methods of the<br>
invention are set forth in Figure 28.<br>
Table 6. Preferred peptides for glycan remodeling<br>
A more detailed list of peptides useful in the invention and their source is provided in<br>
Figure 28.<br>
Other exemplary peptides that are modified by the methods of the invention include<br>
members of the immunoglobulin family (e.g., antibodies, MHC molecules, T cell receptors,<br>
and the like), intercellular receptors (e.g.. integrins, receptors for hormones or growth factors<br>
and the like) lectins, and cytokines (e.g., interleukins). Additional examples include<br>
tissue-type plasminogen activator (TPA), renin, clotting factors such as Factor VIII and<br>
factor IX. bombesin, thrombin, hematopoietic growth factor, colony stimulating factors, viral<br>
antigens, complement peptides, a1-antitrypsin, erythropoietin, P-seleclin glycopeptide<br>
ligand-1 (PSGL-1). granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor, anti-thrombin 111.<br>
interleukins, interferons, peptides A and C. fibrinogen, herceptin™, leptin. glycosidases.<br>
among many others. This list of peptides is exemplary and should not be considered to be<br>
exclusive. Rather, as is apparent from the disclosure provided herein, the methods of the<br>
invention are applicable to any peptide in which a desired glycan structure can be fashioned.<br>
The methods of the invention are also useful for modifying chimeric peptides,<br>
including, but not limited to, chimeric peptides that include a moiety derived from an<br>
immunoglobulin, such as IgG.<br>
Peptides modified by the methods of the invention can be synthetic or wild-type<br>
peptides or they can be mutated peptides, produced by methods known in the art, such as site-<br>
directed mutagenesis. Glycosylation of peptides is typically cither N-linked or O-linked. An<br>
exemplary N-linkage is the attachment of the modified sugar to the side chain of an<br>
asparagine residue. The tripeptide sequences asparagine-X-serine and asparagine-X-<br>
threonine, where X is any amino acid except proline, are the recognition sequences for<br>
enzymatic attachment of a carbohydrate moiety to the asparagine side chain. Thus, the<br>
presence of either of these tripeptide sequences in a peptide creates a potential glycosylation<br>
site. As described elsewhere herein, O-linked glycosylation refers to the attachment of one<br>
sugar (e.g., N-acetylgalactosamine, galactose, mannose, GlcMAc, glucose, fucose or xylose)<br>
to a hydroxy side chain of a hydroxyamino acid, preferably serine or threonine, although 5-<br>
hydroxyproline or 5-hydroxylysine may also be used.<br>
Several exemplary embodiments of the invention are discussed below. While several<br>
of these embodiments use peptides having names having trademarks, and other specific<br>
peptides as the exemplary peptide, these examples are not confined to any specific peptide.<br>
The following exemplary embodiments are contemplated to include all peptide equivalents<br>
and variants of any peptide. Such variants include, but are not limited to, adding and deleting<br>
N-linked and O-linked glycosylation sites, and fusion proteins with added glycosylation sites.<br>
One of skill in the art will appreciate that the following embodiments and the basic methods<br>
disclosed therein can be applied to many peptides with equal success.<br>
In one exemplary embodiment, the present invention provides methods for modifying<br>
Granulocyte Colony Stimulating Factor (G-CSF). Figures 29A to 29G set forth some<br>
examples of how this is accomplished using the methodology disclosed herein. In Figure<br>
29B. a G-CSF peptide that is expressed in a mammalian cell system is trimmed back using a<br>
sialidase. The residues thus exposed are modified by the addition of a sialic acid-<br>
poly(ethylene glycol) moiety (PEG moiety), using an appropriate donor therefor and<br>
ST3Gal 1. Figure 29C sets forth an exemplary scheme for modifying a G-CSF peptide that is<br>
expressed in an insect cell. The peptide is modified by adding a galactose moiety using an<br>
appropriate donor thereof and a galactosyltransferase. The galactose residues arc<br>
functionalized with PEG via a sialic acid-PEG derivative, through the action of ST3Gall. In<br>
Figure 29D, bacterially expressed G-CSF is contacted with an N-acetylgalactosamine donor<br>
and N-acetylgalactosamine transferase. The peptide is functionalized with PEG, using a<br>
PFGylated sialic acid donor and a sialyltransferase. In Figure 29E, mammalian cell<br>
expressed G-CSF is contacted with a sialic acid donor that is modified with levulinic acid,<br>
adding a reactive ketone to the sialic acid donor. After addition to a glycosyl residue on the<br>
glycan on the peptide, the ketone is derivatized with a moiety such as a hydrazine- or amine-<br>
PEG. In Figure 29F, bacterially expressed G-CSF is remodeled by contacting the peptide<br>
with an endo-GalNAc enzyme under conditions where it functions in a synthetic, rather than<br>
a hydrolytic manner, thereby adding a PFG-Gal-GalNAc molecule from an activated<br>
derivative thereof, figure 29G provides another route for remodeling bacterially expressed<br>
G-CSF. The polypeptide is derivatized with a PEGylated N-acetylgalactosamine residue by<br>
contacting the polypeptide with an N-acctylgalactosamine transferase and an appropriate<br>
donor of PEGylated N-acetylgalactosamine.<br>
In another exemplary embodiment, the invention provides methods for modifying<br>
Interferon a-14C (IFNal4C). as shown in Figures 30A to 30N. The various forms of IFNa<br>
are disclosed elsewhere herein. In Figure 30B, IFNal4C expressed in mammalian cells is<br>
first treated with sialidase to trim back the sialic acid units thereon, and then the molecule is<br>
PEGylated using ST3Gal3 and a PEGylated sialic acid donor. In Figure 30C, N-<br>
acetylglucosamine is first added to IFNa14C which has been expressed in insect or fungal<br>
cells, where the reaction is conducted via the action of GnT-I and/or II using an N-<br>
acetylglucosaminc donor. The polypeptide is then PEGylated using a galactosyltransferase<br>
and a donor of PEG-galactose. In Figure 30D, IFNal4C expressed in yeast is first treated<br>
with Endo-H to trim back the glycosyl units thereon. The molecules is galactosylated using a<br>
galactosyltransferase and a galactose donor, and it is then PEGylated using ST3Gal3 and a<br>
donor of PEG-sialic acid. In Figure 30F, IFNal4C produced by mammalian cells is modified<br>

subsequently galactosylated using an appropriate donor and a galactosyltransferase. Then.<br>
lFNal4C is PEGylated using ST3Gal3 and a donor of PEG-sialic acid. In Figure 30H, yeast<br>
produced IFNal4C is first treated with mannosidases to trim back the mannosyl groups. N-<br>
acctylglucosamine is then added using a donor of N-acetylglucosamine and one or more of<br>
GnT-I. II. IV. and V. IFNal4C is further galactosylated using an appropriate donor and a<br>
galactosyltransferase. Then, the polypeptide is PEGylated using ST3Gal3 and a donor of<br>
PFG-sialic acid. In Figure 301. NSO cell expressed IFNal4C is modified by capping<br>
appropriate terminal residues with a sialic acid donor that is modified with levulinic acid,<br>
thereby adding a reactive ketone to the sialic acid donor. After addition to a glycosyl residue<br>
of the peptide, the ketone is derivatized with a moiety such as a hydrazine- or amine- PEG.<br>
In Figure 30J. IFNal4C expressed by mammalian cells is PEGylated using a donor of PEG-<br>
sialic acid and a 2.8-sialyltransferasc. In Figure 30K, IFNal4C produced by mammalian<br>

derivatized with a reactive sialic acid via a linker, so that the polypeptide is attached to the<br>
reactive sialic acid via the linker and the galactose residue. The polypeptide is then contacted<br>
with ST3Gal3 and transferrin, and thus becomes connected with transferrin via the sialic acid<br>
residue. In Figure 30N. lFNal4C expressed in either insect or fungal cells is first treated<br>
with endoglycanase to trim back the glycosyl groups, and is then contacted with a<br>
galactosyltransferase and a galactose donor that is derivatized with a reactive sialic acid via a<br>
linker, so that the polypeptide is attached to the reactive sialic acid via the linker and the<br>
galactose residue. I he molecule is then contacted with ST3Gal3 and transferrin, and thus<br>

is then PEGylated using ST3Gal3 and a PEGylated sialic acid donor. In Figure 30Q, IFNa<br>
expressed in insect cells is first galactosylated using an appropriate donor and a<br>
galactosyltransferase. and is then PEGylated using ST3Gall and a PEGylated sialic acid<br>
donor. Figure 30R offers another method for remodeling IFNa expressed in bacteria:<br>
PEGylated N-acetylgalactosamine is added to the protein using an appropriate donor and N-<br>
acetylgalactosamine transferase. In Figure 30S, IFNa expressed in mammalian cells is<br>
modified by capping appropriate terminal residues with a sialic acid donor that is modified<br>
with levulinic acid, adding a reactive ketone to the sialic acid donor. After addition to a<br>
glycosyl residue of the peptide, the ketone is derivatized with a moiety such as a hydrazinc-<br>
or amine- PEG. In Figure 30T, IFNa expressed in bacteria is PEGylated using a modified<br>
enzyme Endo-N-acetylgalactosamidase, which functions in a synthetic instead of a hydrolyiic<br>
manner, and using a N-acetylgalactosamine donor derivatized with a PEG moiety. In Figure<br>
301 J. N-aeetylgalactosamine is first added IFNa using an appropriate donor and N-<br>
acctylgalactosamine transferase, and then is PEGylated using a sialyltransferasc and a<br>
PEGylated sialic acid donor. In Figure 30V, IFNa expressed in a mammalian system is first<br>
treated with sialidase to trim back the sialic acid residues, and is then PEGylated using a<br>
suitable donor and ST3Gal I and/or ST3Gal3. In Figure 30W, IFNa expressed in mammalian<br>
cells is first treated with sialidase to trim back the sialic acid residues. The polypeptide is<br>
then contacted with ST3Gall and two reactive sialic acid residues that are connect via a<br>
linker, so that the polypeptide is attached to one reactive sialic acid via the linker and the<br>
second sialic acid residue. The polypeptide is subsequently contacted with ST3Gal3 and<br>
transferrin, and thus becomes connected with transferrin via the sialic acid residue. In Figure<br>

acid residues, and is then PEGylated using ST3Gall and a donor of PEG-sialic acid. In<br>

donor of PEGylated galactose. In Figure 30AA. bacterially expressed IFNa first has N-<br>
acctylgalactosamine added using a suitable donor and N-acetylgalactosamine transferase.<br>
The protein is then PEGylated using a sialyltransferase and a donor of PEG-sialic acid. In<br>
Figure 30CC, IFNa expressed in bacteria is modified in another procedure: PEGylated N-<br>
acetylgalactosamine is added to the protein by N-acetylgalactosamine transferase using a<br>
donor of PEGylated N-acetylgalactosamine. In Figure 30DD. IFNa expressed in bacteria is<br>
remodeled in yet another scheme. The polypeptide is first contacted with N-<br>
acetylgalactosaminc transferase and a donor of N-acetylgalactosamine that is derivatized with<br>
a reactive sialic acid via a linker, so that IFNa is attached to the reactive sialic acid via the<br>
linker and the N-acetylgalactosamine. IFNa is then contacted with ST3Gal3 and asialo-<br>
transferrin so that it becomes connected with transferrin via the sialic acid residue. Then,<br>
IFNa is capped with sialic acid residues using ST3Gal3 and a sialic acid donor. An<br>
additional method for modifying bacterially expressed IFNa is disclosed in Figure 30EE.<br>
where IFNa is first exposed to NHS-CO-linker-SA-CMP and is then connected to a reactive<br>
sialic acid via the linker. It is subsequently conjugated with transferrin using ST3Gal3 and<br>
transferrin.<br>

acid residues, then PEGylated using ST3Gal3 and a donor of PEG-sialic acid, and then is<br>
further sialylated using ST3Gal3 and a sialic acid donor. In Figure 36F, GM-CSF expressed<br>
in mammalian cells is modified by capping appropriate terminal residues with a sialic acid<br>
donor that is modified with levulinic acid, adding a reactive ketone to the sialic acid donor.<br>
After addition to a glycosyl residue of the peptide, the ketone is derivatized with a moiety<br>
such as a hydrazine- or amine- PEG. In Figure 36G, GM-CSF expressed in mammalian cells<br>
is sialylated using a sialic acid donor and a 2,8-sialyltransferase. In Figure 361, GM-CSF<br>
expressed in insect cells is modified by addition of N-acetylglucosamine using a suitable<br>
donor and one or more of GnT-I, II. IV. and V, followed by addition of PEGylated galactose<br>
using a suitable donor and a galactosyltransferase. In Figure 36J, yeast expressed GM-CSF is<br>
first treated with endoglycanase and/or mannosidase to trim back the glycosyl units, and<br>

figure 36K. GM-CSF expressed in mammalian cells is first treated with sialidase to trim<br>
back sialic acid residues, and is subsequently sialylated using ST3Gal3 and a sialic acid<br>
donor. The polypeptide is then contacted with ST3Gal1 and two reactive sialic acid residues<br>
connected via a linker, so that the polypeptide is attached to one reactive sialic acid via the<br>
linker and second sialic acid residue. The polypeptide is further contacted with ST3Gal3 and<br>
transferrin, and thus becomes connected with transferrin.<br>
In another exemplary embodiment, the invention provides methods for modification<br>
of Interferon gamma (IFN?). Figures 37A to 37N contain some examples. In Figure 37B.<br>
IFN? expressed in a variety of mammalian cells is first treated with sialidase to trim back<br>
terminal sialic acid residues, and is subsequently PEGylated using ST3Gal3 and a donor of<br>
PF.G-sialic acid. In Figure 37C, IFN? expressed in a mammalian system is first treated with<br>
sialidase to trim back terminal sialic acid residues. The polypeptide is then PHGylated using<br>
ST3Gal3 and a donor of PEG-sialic acid, and is further sialylated with ST3Gal3 and a donor<br>
of sialic acid. In Figure 37D, mammalian cell expressed IFN? is first treated with sialidase<br>
and a-galactosidase to trim back sialic acid and galactose residues. The polypeptide is then<br>
galactosylated using a galactose donor and a galactosyltransferase. Then, IFN? is PEGylated<br>
using a donor of PEG-sialic acid and ST3Gal3. In Figure 37E, IFN? that is expressed in a<br>
mammalian system is first treated with sialidase to trim back terminal sialic acid residues.<br>
The polypeptide is then PEGylated using ST3Gal3 and a donor of PEG-sialic acid, and is<br>
further sialylated with ST3Gal3 and a sialic acid donor. Figure 37F describes another method<br>
for modifying IFN? expressed in a mammalian system. The protein is modified by capping<br>
appropriate terminal residues with a sialic acid donor that is modified with levulinic acid,<br>
adding a reactive ketone to the sialic acid donor. After addition to a slvcosvl residue of the<br>
peptide, the ketone is derivatized with a moiety such as a hydrazine- or amine- PEG. In<br>
Figure 37G, IFN? expressed in mammalian cells is remodeled by addition of sialic acid using<br>
a sialic acid donor and an a 2,8-sialyltransferase. In Figure 371, IFN? expressed in insect or<br>
fungal cells is modified by addition of N-acetylglucosamine using an appropriate donor and<br>
one or more of GnT-I, II, IV, and V. The protein is further modified by addition of PEG<br>
moieties using a donor of PEGylated galactose and a galactosyltransferase. Figure 37.1 offers<br>
a method for modifying IFN? expressed in yeast. The polypeptide is first treated with<br>
endoglycanase to trim back the saccharide chains, and then galactosylated using a galactose<br>
donor and a galactosyltransferase. Then, IFN? is PEGylated using a donor of PEGylated<br>
sialic acid and ST3Gal3. In Figure 37K, IFN? produced by mammalian cells is modified as<br>
follows: the polypeptide is first contacted with ST3Gal3 and a donor of sialic acid that is<br>
derivatized with a reactive galactose via a linker, so that the polypeptide is attached to the<br>
reactive galactose via the linker and sialic acid residue. The polypeptide is then contacted<br>
with a galactosyltransferase and transferrin pre-treated with endoglycanase, and thus becomes<br>
connected with transferrin via the galactose residue. In the scheme illustrated by Figure 37L.<br>
IFN?. which is expressed in a mammalian system, is modified via the action of ST3Gal3:<br>
PEGylated sialic acid is transferred from a suitable donor to IFN?. Figure 37M is an example<br>
of modifying IFN? expressed in insect or fungal cells, where PEGylation of the polypeptide<br>
is achieved by transferring PEGylated N-acetylglucosamine from a donor to IFN? using GnT-<br>
I and/or II. In Figure 37N, IFN? expressed in a mammalian system is remodeled with<br>
addition of PEGylated sialic acid using a suitable donor and an a 2,8-sialyltransferase.<br>
In another exemplary embodiment, the invention provides methods for modifying a1<br>
anti-trypsin (al-protease inhibitor). Some such examples can be found in Figures 38A to<br>
38N. In Figure 383. a1 anti-trypsin expressed in a variety of mammalian cells is first treated<br>
with sialidase to trim back sialic acid residues. PEGylated sialic acid residues are then added<br>
using an appropriate donor, such as CMP-SA-PEG, and a sialyltransferase, such as ST3Gal3.<br>
Figure 38C demonstrates another scheme of a1 anti-trypsin modification, a1 anti-trypsin<br>
expressed in a mammalian system is first treated with sialidase to trim back sialic acid<br>
residues. Sialic acid residues derivatized with PEG are then added using an appropriate<br>
donor and a sialyltransferase, such as ST3Gal3. Subsequently, the molecule is further<br>
modified by the addition of sialic acid residues using a sialic acid donor and ST3Gal3.<br>
Optionally, mammalian cell expressed a1 anti-trypsin is first treated with sialidase and a-<br>
galactosidase to trim back terminal sialic acid and a-linkage galactose residues. The<br>
polypeptide is then galactosylated using galactosyltransferase and a suitable galactose donor.<br>
Further, sialic acid derivatized with PEG is added by the action of ST3Gal3 using a<br>
PEGylated sialic acid donor. In Figure 38D, a1 anti-trypsin expressed in a mammalian<br>
system first has the terminal sialic acid residues trimmed back using sialidase. PEG is then<br>
added to N-linked glycosyl residues via the action of ST3Gal3, which mediates the transfer of<br>
PEGylated sialic acid from a donor, such as CMP-SA-PEG, to a1 anti-trypsin. More sialic<br>
acid residues are subsequently attached using a sialic acid donor and ST3Gal3. Figure 38E<br>
illustratcs another process through which a1 anti-trypsin is remodeled, a1 anti-trypsin<br>
expressed in mammalian cells is modified by capping appropriate terminal residues with a<br>
sialic acid donor that is modified with levulinic acid, adding a reactive ketone to the sialic<br>
acid donor. After addition to a glycosyl residue of the peptide, the ketone is dcrivatized with<br>
a moiety such as a hydrazine- or amine- PEG. In Figure 38F, yet another method of a1 anti-<br>
trypsin modification is disclosed, a1 anti-trypsin obtained from a mammalian expression<br>
system is remodeled with addition of sialic acid using a sialic acid donor and an a 2,8-<br>
sialyltransferase. In Figure 38H, a1 anti-trypsin is expressed in insect or yeast cells, and<br>
remodeled by the addition of terminal TM-acetylglucosamine residues by way of contacting the<br>
polypeptide with UDP-N-acetylglucosamine and one or more of GnT-1, II, IV, or V. Then,<br>
the polypeptide is modified with PEG moieties using a donor of PEGylated galactose and a<br>
galactosyltransferase. In Figure 381, a1 anti-trypsin expressed in yeast cells is treated first<br>
with endoglycanase to trim back glycosyl chains. It is then galactosylated with a<br>
galactosyltransferase and a galactose donor. Then, the polypeptide is PEGylated using<br>
ST3Gal3 and a donor of PEG-sialic acid. In Figure 38J, so anti-trypsin is expressed in a<br>
mammalian system. The polypeptide is first contacted with ST3Gal3 and a donor of sialic<br>
acid that is derivatized with a reactive galactose via a linker, so that the polypeptide is<br>
attached to the reactive galactose via the linker and sialic acid residue. The polypeptide is<br>
then contacted with a galactosyltransferase and transferrin pre-treated with endoglycanase,<br>
and thus becomes connected with transferrin via the galactose residue. In Figure 38L. a1<br>
anti-trypsin expressed in yeast is first treated with endoglycanase to trim back its glycosyl<br>
groups. The protein is then PEGylated using a galactosyltransferase and a donor of galactose<br>
with a PEG moiety. In Figure 38M, a1 anti-trypsin expressed in plant cells is treated with<br>
hexosaminidase, mannosidase, and xylosidase to trim back its glycosyl chains, and<br>
subsequently modified with N-acetylglucosamine derivatized with a PEG moiety, using N-<br>
acctylglucosamine transferase and a suitable donor. In Figure 38N, a1 anti-trypsin expressed<br>
in mammalian cells is modified by adding PEGylated sialic acid residues using ST3Gal3 and<br>
a donor of sialic acid derivatized with PEG.<br>
In another exemplary embodiment, the invention provides methods for modifying<br>
glucocerebrosidase ((3-glucosidase. Cerezyme™ or Ceredase™), as shown in Figures 39A to<br>
39K. In Figure 39B. Cerezyme™ expressed in a mammalian system is first treated with<br>
sialidase to trim back terminal sialic acid residues, and is then PEGylated using ST3Gal3 and<br>
a donor of PEG-sialic acid. In Figure 39C, Cerezyme™ expressed in mammalian cells is first<br>
treated with sialidase to trim back the sialic acid residues, then has mannose-6-phosphate<br>
group attached using ST3Gal3 and a reactive sialic acid derivatized with mannose-6-<br>
phosphate, and then is sialylated using ST3Gal3 and a sialic acid donor. Optionally, NSO<br>
cell expressed Cerezyme™ is first treated with sialidase and galactosidase to trim back the<br>
glycosyl groups, and is then galactosylated using a galactose donor and an a-<br>
galactosyltransferase. Then, mannose-6-phosphate moiety is added to the molecule using<br>
ST3Gal3 and a reactive sialic acid derivatized with mannose-6-phosphate. In Figure 39D,<br>
Cerezyme™ expressed in mammalian cells is first treated with sialidase to trim back the<br>
sialic acid residues, it is then PEGylated using ST3Gal3 and a donor of PEG-sialic acid, and<br>
is then sialylated using ST3Gal3 and a sialic acid donor. In Figure 39E, Cerezyme™<br>
expressed in mammalian cells is modified by capping appropriate terminal residues with a<br>
sialic acid donor that is modified with levulinic acid, adding a reactive ketone to the sialic<br>
acid donor. After addition to a glycosyl residue of the peptide, the ketone is derivatized with<br>
a moiety such as one or more mannose-6-phosphate groups. In Figure 39F, Cerezyme™<br>
expressed in mammalian cells is sialylated using a sialic acid donor and a 2,8-<br>
sialyltransferase. In Figure 39H, Cerezyme™ expressed in insect cells first has N-<br>
acetylglucosamine added using a suitable donor and one or more of GnT-I. II, IV, and V, and<br>
then is PEGylated using a galactosyltransferase and a donor of PEG-galactose. In Figure 391,<br>
Cerezyme™ expressed in yeast is first treated with endoglycanase to trim back the glycosyl<br>
groups, then galactosylated using a galactose donor and a galactosyltransferase, and then<br>
PEGylated using ST3Gal3 and a donor of PEG-sialic acid. In Figure 39JK, Cerezyme™<br>
expressed in mammalian cells is first contacted with ST3Gal3 and two reactive sialic acid<br>
residues connected via a linker, so that the polypeptide is attached to one reactive sialic acid<br>
via the linker and the second sialic acid residue. The polypeptide is then contacted with<br>
ST3Gal3 and desialylated transferrin, and thus becomes connected with transferrin. Then,<br>
the polypeptide is sialylated using a sialic acid donor and ST3Gal3.<br>
In another exemplary embodiment, the invention provides methods for modifying<br>
Tissue-Type Plasminogen Activator (TPA) and its mutant. Several specific modification<br>
schemes arc presented in Figures 40A lo 40W. Figure 40B illustrates one modification<br>
procedure: after TPA is expressed by mammalian cells, it is treated with one or more of<br>
mannosidase(s) and sialidase to trim back mannosyl and/or sialic acid residues. Terminal N-<br>
acetylglucosamine is then added by contacting the polypeptide with a suitable donor of N-<br>
acetylglucosamine and one or more of GnT-I, II, IV, and V. TPA is further galactosylated<br>
using a galactose donor and a galactosyltransferase. Then, PEG is attached to the molecule<br>
by way of sialylation catalyzed by ST3Gal3 and using a donor of sialic acid derivatized with<br>
a PEG moiety. In Figure 40C. TPA is expressed in insect or fungal cells. The modification<br>
includes the steps of addition of N-acetylglucosamine using an appropriate donor of N-<br>
acetyiglucosamine and GnT-I and/or II; galactosylation using a galactose donor and a<br>
galactosyltransferase: and attachment of PEG by way of sialylation using ST3Gal3 and a<br>
donor of sialic acid derivatized with PEG. In Figure 40D, TPA is expressed in yeast and<br>
subsequently treated with endoglycanase to trim back the saccharide chains. The polypeptide<br>
is further PEGylated via the action of a galactosyltransferase. which catalyzes the transfer of<br>
a PEG-galactose from a donor to TPA. In Figure 40E, TPA is expressed in insect or yeast<br>
cells. The polypeptide is then treated with a- and ß- mannosidases to trim back terminal<br>
mannosyl residues. Further, PEG moieties are attached to the molecule via transfer of PKG-<br>
galactose from a suitable donor to TPA, which is mediated by a galactosyltransferase. Figure<br>
40F provides a different method for modification of TPA obtained from an insect or yeast<br>
system: the polypeptide is remodeled by addition of N-acetylglucosamine using a donor of N-<br>
acetylglucosamine and GnT-I and/or II, followed by PEGylation using a galactosyltransferase<br>
and a donor of PEGylated galactose. Figure 40G offers another scheme for remodeling TPA<br>
expressed in insect or yeast cells. Terminal N-acetylglucosamine is added using a donor of<br>
N-acetylglucosamine and GnT-I and/or II. A galactosidase that is modified to operate in a<br>
synthetic, rather than a hydrolytic manner, is utilized to add PEGylated galactose from a<br>
proper donor to the N-acetylglucosamine residues. In Figure 401, TPA expressed in a<br>
mammalian system is first treated with sialidase and galactosidase to trim back sialic acid and<br>
galactose residues. The polypeptide is further modified by capping appropriate terminal<br>
residues with a sialic acid donor that is modified with levulinic acid, adding a reactive ketone<br>
to the sialic acid donor. After addition to a glycosyl residue of the peptide, the ketone is<br>
derivatized with a moiety such as a hydrazine- or amine- PEG. In Figure 40J, TPA, which is<br>
expressed in a mammalian system, is remodeled following this scheme: first, the polypeptide<br>
is treated with a- and ß- mannosidases to trim back the terminal mannosyl residues; sialic<br>
acid residues arc then attached to terminal galactosyl residues using a sialic acid donor and<br>
ST3Gal3; further. TPA is PEGylated via the transfer of PEGylated galactose from a donor to<br>
a N-acctylglucosaminyl residue catalyzed by a galactosyltransferase. In Figure 40K, TPA is<br>
expressed in a plant system. The modification procedure in this example is as follows: TPA<br>
is first treated with hexosaminidase, mannosidase, and xylosidase to trim back its glycosyl<br>
groups: PEGylated N-acctylglucosamine is then added to TPA using a proper donor and N-<br>
acetylglucosamine transferase. In Figure 40M, a TPA mutant (TNK TPA), expressed in<br>
mammalian cells, is remodeled. Terminal sialic acid residues are first trimmed back using<br>
sialidase: ST3Gal3 is then used to transfer PEGylated sialic acid from a donor to TNK TPA,<br>
such that the polypeptide is PEGylated. In Figure 40N. TNK TPA expressed in a mammalian<br>
system is first treated with sialidase to trim back terminal sialic acid residues. The protein is<br>
then PEGylated using CMP-SA-PEG as a donor and ST3Gal3, and further sialylatcd using a<br>
sialic acid donor and ST3Gal3. In Figure 40O, NSO cell expressed TNK TPA is first treated<br>
with sialidase and u-galactosidase to trim back terminal sialic acid and galactose residues.<br>
'INK TPA is then galactosylated using a galactose donor and a galactosyltransferase. The<br>
last step in this remodeling scheme is transfer of sialic acid derivatized with PEG moiety<br>
from a donor to TNK TPA using a sialyltransferase such as ST3Gal3. In Figure 40Q, TNK<br>
TPA is expressed in a mammalian system and is first treated with sialidase to trim back<br>
terminal sialic acid residues. The protein is then PEGylated using ST3Gal3 and a donor of<br>
PEGylated sialic acid. Then, the protein is sialylated using a sialic acid donor and ST3Gal3.<br>
In Figure 40R, TNK TPA expressed in a mammalian system is modified by capping<br>
appropriate terminal residues with a sialic acid donor that is modified with levulinic acid,<br>
adding a reactive ketone to the sialic acid donor. After addition to a glycosyl residue of the<br>
peptide, the ketone is derivatized with a moiety such as a hydrazine- or amine- PEG. In<br>
Figure 40S, TNK TPA expressed in mammalian cells is modified via a different method: the<br>
polypeptide is remodeled with addition of sialic acid using a sialic acid donor and a 2,8-<br>
sialyllransferase. In Figure 40U. TNK TPA expressed in insect cells is remodeled by<br>
addition of N-acctylglucosamine using an appropriate donor and one or more of GnT-I, II,<br>
IV. and V. The protein is further modified by addition of PEG moieties using a donor of<br>
PEGylated galactose and a galactosyltransf'erase. In Figure 40V, TNK TPA is expressed in<br>
yeast. The polypeptide is first treated with endoglycanase to trim back its glycosyl chains<br>
and then PEGylated using a galactose donor derivatized with PEG and a<br>
galactosyltransferase. In Figure 40W, TNK TPA is produced in a mammalian system. The<br>
polypeptide is first contacted with ST3Gal3 and a donor of sialic acid that is derivatized with<br>
a reactive galactose via a linker, so that the polypeptide is attached to the reactive galactose<br>
via the linker and sialic acid residue. The polypeptide is then contacted with a<br>
galactosyltransferase and anti-TNF IG chimera produced in CHO, and thus becomes<br>
connected with the chimera via the galactose residue.<br>
In another exemplary embodiment, the invention provides methods for modifying<br>
Interleukin-2 (II.-2). Figures 41A to 41G provide some examples. Figure 41B provides a<br>
two-step modification scheme: IL-2 produced by mammalian cells is first treated with<br>
sialidase to trim back its terminal sialic acid residues, and is then PEGylated using ST3Gal3<br>
and a donor of PEGylated sialic acid. In Figure 41C, insect cell expressed IL-2 is modified<br>
first by galactosylation using a galactose donor and a galactosyltransferase. Subsequently.<br>
IL-2 is PEGylated using ST3Gal3 and a donor of PEGylated sialic acid. In Figure 41D, IL-2<br>
expressed in bacteria is modified with N-acetylgalactosamine using a proper donor and N-<br>
acetylgalactosamine transferase, followed by a step of PEGylation with a PEG-sialic acid<br>
donor and a sialyltransferase. Figure 41E offers another scheme of modifying IL-2 produced<br>
by a mammalian system. The polypeptide is modified by capping appropriate terminal<br>
residues with a sialic acid donor that is modified with levulinic acid, adding a reactive ketone<br>
to the sialic acid donor. After addition to a glycosyl residue of the peptide, the ketone is<br>
derivatized with a moiety such as a hydrazine- or amine- PEG. Figure 41F illustrates an<br>
example of remodeling IL-2 expressed by E. coli. The polypeptide is PEGylated using a<br>
reactive N-acetylgalactosamine complex derivatized with a PEG group and an enzyme that is<br>
modified so that it functions as a synthetic enzyme rather than a hydrolytic one. In Figure<br>
41G. IL-2 expressed by bacteria is modified by addition of PEGylated N-acetylgalactosam inc-<br>
using a proper donor and N-acetylgalactosamine transferase.<br>

PEGylation, using ST3Gal3 and a donor of PEGylated sialic acid, figure 42F offers another<br>
example of modification of Factor VIII that is expressed by mammalian cells. The protein is<br>
PEGylated using ST3Gall and a donor of PEGylated sialic acid. In Figure 42G, mammalian<br>

such as a hydrazine- or amine- PEG. In Figure 42J, Factor VIII expressed by mammalian<br>
cells is first treated with Endo-H to trim back glycosyl groups. It is then PEGylated using a<br>
galactosyltransferase and a donor of PEG-galactose. In Figure 42K, Factor VIII expressed in<br>

acid donor. In Figure 42N, Factor VIII is produced by mammalian cells and modified as<br>
follows: it is first treated with mannosidases to trim back the terminal mannosyl groups. A<br>

human growth hormone-mucin fusion protein: the fusion protein is PEGylated through the<br>
action of N-acetylgalactosamine transferase using a donor of PEGylated N-<br>
acetylgalactosamine. Figure 47J provides a further remodeling scheme for human growth<br>
hormone-mucin fusion protein. The fusion protein is first contacted with N-<br>
acelylgalactosamine transferase and a donor of N-acetylgalactosamine that is derivatized with<br>
a reactive sialic acid via a linker, so that the fusion protein is attached to the reactive sialic<br>

A. Creation or elimination of N-linked glycosylation sites<br>
The present invention contemplates the use of peptides in which the site of the glycan<br>
chain(s) on the peptide have been altered from that of the native peptide. Typically, N-linked<br>
gKcan chains are linked to the primary peptide structure at asparaginc residues where the<br>
asparagine residue is within an amino acid sequence that is recognized by a membrane-bound<br>
glycosyltransferase in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Typically, the recognition site on the<br>
primary peptide structure is the sequence asparagine-X-serine/threonine where X can be any<br>
amino acid except proline and aspartic acid. While this recognition site is typical, the<br>
invention further encompasses peptides that have N-linked glycan chains at other recognition<br>
sites where the N-linked chains are added using natural or recombinant glycosyltransferases.<br>
Since the recognition site for N-linked glycosylation of a peptide is known, it is<br>
within the skill of persons in the art to create mutated primary peptide sequences wherein a<br>
native N-linked glycosylation recognition site is removed, or alternatively or in addition, one<br>
or more additional N-glycosylation recognition sites are created. Most simply, an asparagine<br>
residue can be removed from the primary sequence of the peptide thereby removing the<br>
attachment site for a glycan. thus removing one glycan from the mature peptide. For<br>
example, a native recognition site with the sequence of asparaaine-serine-serine can be<br>
genetically engineered to have the sequence leucine-serine-serine, thus eliminating a N-<br>
linkcd glycosylation site at this position.<br>
Further, an N-linked glycosylation site can be removed by altering the residues in the<br>
recognition site so that even though the asparagine residue is present, one or more of the<br>
additional recognition residues are absent. For example, a native sequence of asparagine-<br>
scrine-serine can be mutated to asparagine-serine-lysine, thus eliminating an N-glycosylation<br>
site at that position. In the case of N-linked glycosylation sites comprising residues other<br>
than the typical recognition sites described above, the skilled artisan can determine the<br>
sequence and residues required for recognition by the appropriate glycosyltransferase, and<br>
then mutate at least one residue so the appropriate glycosyltransferase no longer recognizes<br>
that site. In other words, it is well within the skill of the artisan to manipulate the primary<br>
sequence of a peptide such that glycosylation sites are either created or are removed, or both,<br>
thereby generating a peptide having an altered glycosylation pattern. The invention should<br>
therefore not be construed to be limited to any primary peptide sequence provided herein as<br>
the sole sequence for glycan remodeling, but rather should be construed to include any and all<br>
peptide sequences suitable for glycan remodeling.<br>
To create a mutant peptide, the nucleic acid sequence encoding the primary sequence<br>
of the peptide is altered so that native codons encoding native amino acid residues arc<br>
mutated to generate a codon encoding another amino acid residue. Techniques for altering<br>
nucleic acid sequence are common in the art and are described for example in any well-<br>
known molecular biology manual.<br>
In addition, the nucleic acid encoding a primary peptide structure can be synthesized<br>
in vitro, using standard techniques. For example, a nucleic acid molecule can be synthesized<br>
in a "gene machine" using protocols such as the phosphoramidite method. If chemically-<br>
synthesized double stranded DNA is required for an application such as the synthesis of a<br>
nucleic acid or a fragment thereof, then each complementary strand is synthesized<br>
separately. The production of short nucleic acids (60 to 80 base pairs) is technically<br>
straightforward and can be accomplished by synthesizing the complementary strands and<br>
then annealing them. For the production of longer nucleic acids (&gt;300 base pairs), special<br>
strategies may be required, because the coupling efficiency of each cycle during chemical<br>
DNA synthesis is seldom 100%. To overcome this problem, synthetic genes (double-<br>
stranded) are assembled in modular form from single-stranded fragments that are froM 20 to<br>
100 nucleotides in length. For reviews on polynucleotide synthesis, see, for example. Click<br>
and Pasternak (Molecular Biotechnology, Principles and Applications of Recombinant DNA.<br>
1994. ASM Press). Itakura et al. (1984. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 53:323), and Climie et al.<br>
(1990. Proc. Nat'l Acad. Sci. USA 87:633).<br>
Additionally, changes in the nucleic acid sequence encoding the peptide can be made<br>
bv silo-directed mutagenesis. As will be appreciated, this technique typically employs a<br>
phage vector which exists in both a single stranded and double stranded form. Typical<br>
vectors useful in site-directed mutagenesis include vectors such as the M13 phage. These<br>
phage are readily available and their use is generally well known to those skilled in the art.<br>
Double stranded plasmids are also routinely employed in site-directed mutagenesis which<br>
eliminates the step of transferring the nucleic acid of interest from a plasmid to a phage.<br>
In general, site-directed mutagenesis is performed by first obtaining a single-stranded<br>
vector or melting the two strands of a double stranded vector which includes within its<br>
sequence a DNA sequence which encodes the desired peptide. An oligonucleotide primer<br>
bearing the desired mutated sequence is prepared generally synthetically. This primer is then<br>
annealed with the single-stranded vector, and subjected to DNA polymerizing enzymes such<br>
as E. coli polymerase I Klenow fragment, in order to complete the synthesis of the mutation-<br>
bearing strand. Thus, a heteroduplex is formed wherein one strand encodes the original non-<br>
mutated sequence and the second strand bears the desired mutation. This heteroduplex vector<br>
is then used to transform or transfect appropriate cells, such as E. coli cells, and clones are<br>
selected which include recombinant vectors bearing the mutated sequence arrangement. A<br>
genetic selection scheme was devised by Kunkel et al. (1987, Kunkel et al.. Methods<br>
Enzymol. 154:367-382) to enrich for clones incorporating the mutagenic oligonucleotide.<br>
Alternatively, the use of PCR™ with commercially available thermostable enzymes such as<br>
Taq polymerase may be used to incorporate a mutagenic oligonucleotide primer into an<br>
amplified DNA fragment that can then be cloned into an appropriate cloning or expression<br>
vector. The PCR™-mediated mutagenesis procedures of Tomic et al. (1990, Nucl. Acids<br>
Res., 12:1656) and Upenderet al. (1995, Biotechniques, 18:29-31) provide two examples of<br>
such protocols. A PCR™ employing a thermostable ligase in addition to a thermostable<br>
polymerase may also be used to incorporate a phosphorylated mutagenic oligonucleotide into<br>
an amplified DNA fragment that may then be cloned into an appropriate cloning or<br>
expression vector. The mutagenesis procedure described by Michael (1994. Biotechniques<br>
16:410-412) provides an example of one such protocol.<br>
Not all Asn-X-Ser/Thr sequences are N-glycosylated suggesting the context in which<br>
the motif is presented is important. In another approach, libraries of mutant peptides having<br>
novel N-linked consensus sites are created in order to identify novel N-linked sites that are<br>
glycosylated in vivo and arc beneficial to the activity, stability or other characteristics of the<br>
peptide.<br>
As noted previously, the consensus sequence for the addition of "N-linked glycan<br>
chains in glycoproteins is Asn-X-Ser/Thr where X can be any amino acid. The nucleotide<br>
sequence encoding the amino acid two positions to the carboxyl terminal side of the Asn may<br>
be mutated to encode a Ser and/or Thr residue using standard procedures known to those of<br>
ordinary skill in the art. As stated above not all Asn-X-Ser/Thr sites are modified by the<br>
addition of glycans. Therefore, each recombinant mutated glycoprotein must be expressed in<br>
a fungal, yeast or animal or mammalian expression system and analyzed for the addition of<br>
an N-linked glycan chain. The techniques for the characterization of glycosylation sites are<br>
well known to one skilled in the art. Further, the biological function of the mutated<br>
recombinant glycoprotein can be determined using assays standard for the particular protein<br>
being examined. Thus, it becomes a simple matter to manipulate the primary sequence of a<br>
peptide and identify novel glycosylation sites contained therein, and further determine the<br>
effect of the novel site on the biological activity of the peptide.<br>
In an alternative embodiment, the nucleotide sequence encoding the amino acid two<br>
positions to the amino terminal side of Ser/Thr residues may be mutated to encode an Asn<br>
using standard procedures known to those of ordinary skill in the art. The procedures to<br>
determine whether a novel glycosylation site has been created and the effect of this site on the<br>
biological activity of the peptide are described above.<br>
B. Creation or elimination of O-linked glycosylation sites<br>
The addition of an O-linked glycosylation site to a peptide is conveniently<br>
accomplished by altering the primary amino acid sequence of the peptide such that it contains<br>
one or more additional O-linked glycosylation sites compared with the beginning primary<br>
amino acid sequence of the peptide. The addition of an O-linked glycosylation site to the<br>
peptide may also be accomplished by incorporation of one or more amino acid species into<br>
the peptide which comprises an -OH group, preferably serine or threonine residues, within<br>
the sequence of the peptide, such that the OH group is accessible and available for O-linked<br>
glycosylation. Similar to the discussion of alteration of N-linked glycosylation sites in a<br>
peptide, the primary amino acid sequence of the peptide is preferably altered at the nucleotide<br>
level. Specific nucleotides in the DNA sequence encoding the peptide may be altered such<br>
that a desired amino acid is encoded by the sequence. Mutation(s) in DNA arc preferably<br>
made using methods known in the art. such as the techniques of phosphoramidite method<br>
DNA synthesis and site-directed mutagenesis described above.<br>
Alternatively, the nucleotide sequence encoding a putative site for O-linked glycan<br>
addition can be added to the DNA molecule in one or several copies to either 5' or the 3' end<br>
of the molecule. The altered DNA sequence is then expressed in any one of a fungal, yeast,<br>
or animal or mammalian expression system and analyzed for the addition of the sequence to<br>
the peptide and whether or not this sequence is a functional O-linked glycosylation site.<br>
Briefly, a synthetic peptide acceptor sequence is introduced at either the 5' or 3' end of the<br>
nucleotide molecule. In principle, the addition of this type of sequence is less disruptive to<br>
the resulting glycoprotein when expressed in a suitable expression system. The altered DNA<br>
is then expressed in CHO cells or other suitable expression system and the proteins expressed<br>
thereby are examined for the presence of an O-linked glycosylation site. In addition, the<br>
presence or absence of glycan chains can be determined.<br>
In yet another approach, advantageous sites for new O-linked sites may be found in a<br>
peptide by creating libraries of the peptide containing various new O-linked sites. For<br>
example, the consensus amino acid sequence for N-acetylgalactosamine addition by an N-<br>
acetylgalactosaminyltransferase depends on the specific transferase used. The amino acid<br>
sequence of a peptide may be scanned to identify contiguous groups of amino acids that can<br>
be mutated to generate potential sites for addition of O-linked glycan chains. These<br>
mutations can be generated using standard procedures known to those of ordinary skill in the<br>
art as described previously. In order to determine if any discovered glycosylation site is<br>
actually glycosylated, each recombinant mutated peptide is then expressed in a suitable<br>
expression system and is subsequently analyzed for the addition of the site and/or the<br>
presence of an O-linked glycan chain.<br>
C. Chemical synthesis of peptides<br>
While the primary structure of peptides useful in the invention can be generated most<br>
efficiently in a cell-based expression system, it is within the scope of the present invention<br><br>
that the peptides may be generated synthetically. Chemical synthesis of peptides is well<br>
known in the art and include, without limitation, stepwise solid phase synthesis, and fragment<br>
condensation either in solution or on solid phase. A classic stepwise solid phase synthesis of<br>
involves covalcntly linking an amino acid corresponding to the carboxy-terminal amino acid<br>
of the desired peptide chain to a solid support and extending the peptide chain toward the<br>
amino end by stepwise coupling of activated amino acid derivatives having activated<br>
carboxyl groups. After completion of the assembly of the fully protected solid phase bound<br>
peptide chain, the peptide-solid phase covalent attachment is cleaved by suitable chemistry<br>
and the protecting groups are removed to yield the product peptide. See, R. Merrifield, Solid<br>
Phase Peptide Synthesis: The Synthesis of a Tetrapeptide, J. Am. Chem. Soc, 85:2149-2154<br>
(1963). The longer the peptide chain, the more challenging it is to obtain high-purity well-<br>
defined products. Due to the production of complex mixtures, the stepwise solid phase<br>
synthesis approach has size limitations. In general, well-defined peptides of 100 contiguous<br>
amino acid residues or more are not routinely prepared via stepwise solid phase synthesis.<br>
The segment condensation method involves preparation of several peptide segments<br>
by the solid phase stepwise method, followed by cleavage from the solid phase and<br>
purification of these maximally protected segments. The protected segments are condensed<br>
one-by-one to the first segment, which is bound to the solid phase.<br>
The peptides useful in the present invention may be synthesized by exclusive solid<br>
phase synthesis, partial solid phase methods, fragment condensation or classical solution<br>
synthesis. These synthesis methods are well-known to those of skill in the art (see. for<br>
example. Merrifield. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 85:2149 (1963), Stewart et al.. "Solid Phase Peptide<br>
Synthesis" (2nd Edition), (Pierce Chemical Co. 1984), Bayer and Rapp, Chem. Pept. Prot. 3:3<br>
(1986). Atherton et al., Solid Phase Peptide Synthesis: A Practical Approach (1RL Press<br>
1989), Fields and Colowick. "Solid-Phase Peptide Synthesis," Methods in Enzymology<br>
Volume 289 (Academic Press 1997), and Lloyd-Williams et al., Chemical Approaches to the<br>
Synthesis of Peptides and Peptides (CRC Press, Inc. 1997)). Variations in total chemical<br>
synthesis strategies, such as "native chemical ligation" and "expressed peptide ligation" are<br>
also standard (see, for example. Dawson et al., Science 266:776 (1994), Hackeng et al., Proc.<br>
Nat'l Acad. Sci. USA 94:7845 (1997), Dawson, Methods Enzymol. 287: 34 (1997). Muir et<br>
al. Proc. Nat'l Acad. Sci. USA 95:6705 (1998), and Severinov and Muir, J. Biol. Chem.<br>
273:16205 (1998)). Also useful arc the solid phase peptide synthesis methods developed bGryphon Sciences. South San Francisco, CA. See, U.S. Patent Nos. 6,326.468, 6,217.873.<br>
6.174.530. and 6,001,364. all of which are incorporated in their entirety by reference herein.<br>
P. Post-translational modifications<br>
It will be appreciated to one of ordinary skill in the art that peptides may undergo<br>
post-translational modification besides the addition of N-linked and/or O-linked glycans<br>
thereto. It is contemplated that peptides having post-translational modifications other than<br>
glycosylation can be used as peptides in the invention, as long as the desired biological<br>
activity or function of the peptide is maintained or improved. Such post-translational<br>
modifications may be natural modifications usually carried out in vivo, or engineered<br>
modifications of the peptide carried out in vitro. Contemplated known modifications include,<br>
but are not limited to, acetylation, acylation, ADP-ribosylation, amidation, covalent<br>
attachment of flavin, covalent attachment of a heme moiety, covalent attachment of a<br>
nucleotide or nucleotide derivative, covalent attachment of a lipid or lipid derivative, covalent<br>
attachment of phosphotidylinositol, cross-linking, cyclization. disulfide bond formation,<br>
demethylation, formation of covalent crosslinks, formation of cysteine, formation of<br>
pyroglutamate. formylation. gamma carboxylation, glycosylation, GP1 anchor formation,<br>
hydroxylation, iodination, methylation, myristoylation, oxidation, proteolytic processing,<br>
phosphorylation, prenylation, racemization, selenoylation, sulfation, transfer-RNA mediated<br>
addition of amino acids to peptides such as arginylation, and ubiquitination. Enzymes that<br>
may be used to carry out many of these modifications are well known in the art, and available<br>
commercially from companies such as Boehringer Mannheim (Indianapolis, IN) and Sigma<br>
Chemical Company (St. Louis, MO), among others.<br>
Such modifications are well known to those of skill in the art and have been described<br>
in great detail in the scientific literature. Several particularly common modifications,<br>
glycosylation. lipid attachment, sulfation, gamma-carboxylation of glutamic acid residues,<br>
hydroxylation and ADP-ribosylation, for instance, are described in most basic texts, such as<br>
Peptides-Structure and Molecular Properties, 2nd Ed., T. E. Creighton, W. H. Freeman and<br>
Company, New York (1993). Many detailed reviews are available on this subject, such as by<br>
Wold. F., Post-translational Covalent Modification of Peptides, B. C. Johnson, Ed., Academic<br>
Press. New York 1 -12 (1983); Seifter et al. (Meth. Enzymol. 182: 626-646 (1990)) and<br>
Rattan etal. (Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 663:48-62 (1992)).<br>
Covalent modifications of a peptide may also be introduced into the molecule in vitro<br>
by reacting targeted amino-acid residues of the peptide with an organic derivatizing agent<br>
that is capable of reacting with selected side chains or terminal amino-acid residues. Most<br>
commonly derivatized residues are cysteinyl, histidyl, lysinyl, arginyl, tyrosyl, glutaminyl.<br>
asparaginyl and amino terminal residues. Hydroxylation of proline and lysine,<br>
phosphorylation of hydroxyl groups of seryl and threonyl residues, methylation of the alpha-<br>
amino groups of lysine, histidine, and histidine side chains, acetylation of the N-terminal<br>
amine and amidation of the C-terminal carboxylic groups. Such derivatized moieties may<br>
improve the solubility, absorption, biological half life and the like. The moieties may also<br>
eliminate or attenuate any undesirable side effect of the peptide and the like.<br>
In addition, derivatization with Afunctional agents is useful for cross-linking the<br>
peptide to water insoluble support matrices or to other macromolecular carriers. Commonly<br>
used cross-linking agents include glutaraldehyde, N-hydroxysuccinimide esters,<br>
homobifunctional imidoesters, l,l-bis(-diazoloacetyl)-2-phenylethane, and Afunctional<br>
maleimides. Derivatizing agents such as methyl-3-[9p-azidophenyl)]dithiopropioimidate<br>
yield photoactivatable intermediates that are capable of forming crosslinks in the presence of<br>
light. Alternatively, reactive water-insoluble matrices such as cyanogen bromide activated<br>
carbohydrates and the reactive substrates described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,969,287 and 3,691,016<br>
may be employed for peptide immobilization.<br>
E. Fusion peptides/peptides<br>
Peptides useful in the present invention may comprise fusion peptides. Fusion<br>
peptides are particularly advantageous where biological and/or functional characteristics of<br>
two peptides are desired to be combined in one peptide molecule. Such fusion peptides can<br>
present combinations of biological activity and function that are not found in nature to create<br>
novel and useful molecules of therapeutic and industrial applications. Biological activities of<br>
interest include, but are not limited to, enzymatic activity, receptor and/or ligand activity,<br>
immunogenic motifs, and structural domains.<br>
Such fusion peptides are well known in the art, and the methods of creation will be<br>
well-known to those in the art. For example, a human a-interferon—human albumin fusion<br>
peptide has been made wherein the resulting peptide has the therapeutic benefits of a-<br>
interferon combined with the long circulating life of albumin, thereby creating a therapeutic<br>
composition that allows reduced dosing frequency and potentially reduced side effects in<br>
patients. See. Albuferon™ from Human Genome Sciences, Inc. and U.S. Patent No.<br>
5.766,883. Other fusion peptides include antibody molecules that are described elsewhere<br>
herein.<br>
F. Generation of smaller "biologically active' molecules<br>
The peptides used in the invention may be variants of native peptides, wherein a<br>
fragment of the native peptide is used in place of the full length native peptide. In addition,<br>
pre-pro-, and pre-peptides are contemplated. Variant peptides may be smaller in size that the<br>
native peptide, and may comprise one or more domains of a larger peptide. Selection of<br>
specific peptide domains can be advantageous when the biological activity of certain domains<br>
in the peptide is desired, but the biological activity of other domains in the peptide is not<br>
desired. Also included are truncations of the peptide and internal deletions which may<br>
enhance the desired therapeutic effect of the peptide. Any such forms of a peptide is<br>
contemplated to be useful in the present invention provided that the desired biological<br>
activity of the peptide is preserved.<br>
Shorter versions of peptides may have unique advantages not found in the native<br>
peptide. In the case of human albumin, it has been found that a truncated form comprising as<br>
little as 63% of the native albumin peptide is advantageous as a plasma volume expander.<br>
The truncated albumin peptide is considered to be better than the native peptide for this<br>
therapeutic purpose because an individual peptide dose of only one-half to two-thirds that of<br>
natural-human serum albumin, or recombinant human serum albumin is required for the<br>
equivalent colloid osmotic effect. See U.S. Patent No. 5.380,712, the entirely of which is<br>
incorporated by reference herein.<br>
Smaller "biologically active" peptides have also been found to have enhanced<br>
therapeutic activity as compared to the native peptide. The therapeutic potential of IL-2 is<br>
limited by various side effects dominated by the vascular leak syndrome. A shorter<br>
chemically synthesized version of the peptide consisting of residues 1-30 corresponding to<br>
the entire a-helix was found to fold properly and contain the natural IL-2 biological activity<br>
with out the attending side effects.<br>
G. Generation of novel peptides<br>
The peptide of the invention may be derived from a primary sequence of a<br>
native peptide, or may be engineered using any of the many means known to those of skill in<br>
the art. Such engineered peptides can be designed and/or selected because of enhanced or<br>
novel properties as compared with the native peptide. For example, peptides may be<br>
engineered to have increased enzyme reaction rates, increased or decreased binding affiniu<br>
to a substrate or ligand. increased or decreased binding affinity to a receptor, altered<br>
specificity for a substrate, ligand. receptor or other binding partner, increased or decreased<br>
stability in vitro and/or in vivo, or increased or decreased immunogenicity in an animal.<br>
H. Mutations<br>
1. Rational design mutation<br>
The peptides useful in the methods of the invention may be mutated to enhance a<br>
desired biological activity or function, to diminish an undesirable property of the peptide,<br>
and/or to add novel activities or functions to the peptide. "Rational peptide design" may be<br>
used to generate such altered peptides. Once the amino acid sequence and structure of the<br>
peptide is known and a desired mutation planned, the mutations can be made most<br>
conveniently to the corresponding nucleic acid codon which encodes the amino acid residue<br>
that is desired to be mutated. One of skill in the art can easily determine how the nucleic<br>
acid sequence should be altered based on the universal genetic code, and knowledge of codon<br>
preferences in the expression system of choice. A mutation in a codon may be made to<br>
change the amino acid residue that will be polymerized into the peptide during translation.<br>
Alternatively, a codon may be mutated so that the corresponding encoded amino acid residue<br>
is the same, but the codon choice is better suited to the desired peptide expression system.<br>
For example, cys-residues may be replaced with other amino acids to remove disulfide bonds<br>
from the mature peptide, catalytic domains may be mutated to alter biological activity, and in<br>
general, isoforms of the peptide can be engineered. Such mutations can be point mutations,<br>
deletions, insertions and truncations, among others.<br>
Techniques to mutate specific amino acids in a peptide are well known in the art. The<br>
technique of site-directed mutagenesis, discussed above, is well suited for the directed<br>
mutation of codons. The oligonucleotide-mediated mutagenesis method is also discussed in<br>
detail in Sambrook et al. (2001. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring<br>
Harbor Laboratory. New York, starting at page 15.51). Systematic deletions, insertions and<br>
truncations can be made using linker insertion mutagenesis, digestion with nuclease Bal 31.<br>
and linker-scanning mutagenesis, among other method well known to those in the art<br>
(Sambrook et al., 2001, Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor<br>
Laboratory. New York).<br>
Rational peptide design has been successfully used to increase the stability of<br>
enzymes with respect to thermoinactivation and oxidation. For example, the stability of an<br>
enzyme was improved by removal of asparagine residues in a-amylase (Declerck et al.. 2000.<br>
J. Mol. Biol. 301:1041-1057), the introduction of more rigid structural elements such as<br>
proline into a-amylase (Igarashi et al., 1999, Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 63:1535-1540)<br>
and D-xylose isomerase (Zhu et al., 1999, Peptide Eng. 12:635-638). Further, the<br>
introduction of additional hydrophobic contacts stabilized 3-isopropylmalate dehydrogenase<br>
(Akanuma et al.. 1999. F.ur. J. Biochem. 260:499-504) and formate dehydrogenase obtained<br>
from Pseudomonas sp. (Rojkova et al., 1999. FEBS Lett. 445:183-188). The mechanisms<br>
behind the stabilizing effect of these mutations is generally applicable to many peptides.<br>
These and similar mutations are contemplated to be useful with respect to the peptides<br>
remodeled in the methods of the present invention.<br>
2. Random mutagenesis techniques<br>
Novel peptides useful in the methods of the invention may be generated using<br>
techniques that introduce random mutations in the coding sequence of the nucleic acid. The<br>
nucleic acid is then expressed in a desired expression system, and the resulting peptide is<br>
assessed for properties of interest. Techniques to introduce random mutations into DNA<br>
sequences are well known in the art, and include PCR mutagenesis, saturation mutagenesis,<br>
and degenerate oligonucleotide approaches. See Sambrook and Russell (2001, Molecular<br>
Cloning, A Laboratory Approach, Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY) and<br>
Ausubel et al. (2002, Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, John Wiley &amp; Sons, NY).<br>
In PCR mutagenesis, reduced Taq polymerase fidelity is used to introduce random<br>
mutations into a cloned fragment of DNA (Leung et al., 1989. Technique 1:11-15). This is a<br>
very powerful and relatively rapid method of introducing random mutations into a DNA<br>
sequence. The DNA region to be mutagenized is amplified using the polymerase chain<br>
reaction (PCR) under conditions that reduce the fidelity of DNA synthesis by Taq DNA<br>
polymerase, e.g., by using an altered dGTP/dATP ratio and by adding Mn2+ to the PCR<br>
reaction. The pool of amplified DNA fragments are inserted into appropriate cloning vectors<br>
to provide random mutant libraries.<br>
Saturation mutagenesis allows for the rapid introduction of a large number of single<br>
base substitutions into cloned DNA fragments (Mayers et al., 1985, Science 229:242). This<br>
technique includes generation of mutations, e.g., by chemical treatment or irradiation of<br>
single-stranded DNA in vitro, and synthesis of a complementary DNA strand. The mutation<br>
frequency can be modulated by modulating the severity of the treatment, and essentially all<br>
possible base substitutions can be obtained. Because this procedure does not involve a<br>
genetic selection for mutant fragments, both neutral substitutions as well as those that alter<br>
function, are obtained. The distribution of point mutations is not biased toward conserved<br>
sequence elements.<br>
A library of nucleic acid homologs can also be generated from a set of degenerate<br>
oligonucleotide sequences. Chemical synthesis of a degenerate oligonucleotide sequences<br>
can be carried out in an automatic DNA synthesizer, and the synthetic genes may then be<br>
ligated into an appropriate expression vector. The synthesis of degenerate oligonucleotides is<br>
known in the art (see for example, Narang, SA (1983) Tetrahedron 39:3; Itakura et al. (1981)<br>
Recombinant DNA, Proc 3rd Cleveland Sympos. Macromolecules, ed. AG Walton,<br>
Amsterdam: Elsevier pp. 273-289: Itakura et al. (1984) Annu. Rev. Biochem. 53:323; Itakura<br>
et al. (1984) Science 198:1056; Ike et al. (1983) Nucleic Acid Res. 11:477. Such techniques<br>
have been employed in the directed evolution of other peptides (see. for example. Scott et al.<br>
(1990) Science 249:386-390; Roberts et al. (1992) PNAS 89:2429-2433; Devlin et al. (1990)<br>
Science 249: 404-406: Cwirla et al. (1990) PNAS 87: 6378-6382; as well as U.S. Pat. Nos.<br>
5,223,409, 5.198,346. and 5,096,815).<br>
a. Directed evolution<br>
Peptides useful in the methods of the invention may also be generated using "directed<br>
evolution" techniques. In contrast to site directed mutagenesis techniques where knowledge<br>
of the structure of the peptide is required, there now exist strategies to generate libraries of<br>
mutations from which to obtain peptides with improved properties without knowledge of the<br>
structural features of the peptide. These strategies are generally known as "directed<br>
evolution" technologies and are different from traditional random mutagenesis procedures in<br>
that they involve subjecting the nucleic acid sequence encoding the peptide of interest to<br>
recursive rounds of mutation, screening and amplification.<br>
In some "directed evolution" techniques, the diversity in the nucleic acids obtained is<br>
generated by mutation methods that randomly create point mutations in the nucleic acid<br>
sequence. The point mutation techniques include, but are not limited to, "error-prone<br>
PCRTM- (Caldwell and Joyce, 1994; PCR Methods Appl. 2: 28-33; and Ke and Madison,<br>
1997. Nucleic Acids Res. 25: 3371-3372), repeated oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis<br>
(Reidhaar-Olson et al., 1991. Methods Enzymol. 208:564-586), and any of the<br>
aforementioned methods of random mutagenesis.<br>
Another method of creating diversity upon which directed evolution can act is the use<br>
of mutator genes. The nucleic acid of interest is cultured in a mutator cell strain the genome<br>
of which typically encodes defective DNA repair genes (U.S. Patent No. 6,365,410:<br>
Selifonova et al.. 2001. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 67:3645-3649; Long-McGie et al., 2000.<br>
Biotech. Bioeng. 68:121-125: sec, Genencor International Inc. Palo Alto CA).<br>
Achieving diversity using directed evolution techniques may also be accomplished<br>
using saturation mutagenesis along with degenerate primers (Gene Site Saturation<br>
Mutagenesis™. Diversa Corp., San Diego, CA). In this type of saturation mutagenesis,<br>
degenerate primers designed to cover the length of the nucleic acid sequence to be diversified<br>
are used to prime the polymerase in PCR reactions. In this manner, each codon of a coding<br>
sequence for an amino acid may be mutated to encode each of the remaining common<br>
nineteen amino acids. This technique may also be used to introduce mutations, deletions and<br>
insertions to specific regions of a nucleic acid coding sequence while leaving the rest of the<br>
nucleic acid molecule untouched. Procedures for the gene saturation technique are well<br>
known in the art, and can be found in U.S. Patent 6.171,820.<br>
b. DNA shuffling<br>
Novel peptides useful in the methods of the invention may also be generated using the<br>
techniques of gene-shuffling, motif-shuffling, exon-shuffling. and/or codon-shuffling<br>
(collectively referred to as "DNA shuffling"). DNA shuffling techniques are may be<br>
employed to modulate the activities of peptides useful in the invention and may be used to<br>
generate peptides having altered activity. See, generally, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5.605.793;<br>
5.81 1,238; 5.830.721: 5.834,252; and 5,837.458, and Stemmer et al. (1994. Nature<br>
370(6488):389-391): Crameri et al. (1998, Nature 391 (6664):288-291); Zhang et al. (1997.<br>
Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 94(9):4504-4509); Stemmer et al. (1994. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci<br>
USA 91(22): 10747-10751), Patten et al. (1997, Curr. Opinion Biotechnol. 8:724-33);<br>
Harayama, (1998, Trends Biotechnol. 16(2):76-82); Hansson, et al., (1999, J. Mol. Biol.<br>
287:265-76); and Lorenzo and Blasco (1998, Biotechniques 24(2):308-13) (each of these<br>
patents are hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety).<br>
DNA shuffling involves the assembly of two or more DNA segments by homologous<br>
or site-specific recombination to generate variation in the polynucleotide sequence. DNA<br>
shuffling has been used to generate novel variations of human immunodeficiency virustype-1<br>
proteins (Pekrun et al., 2002, J. Virol. 76(6):2924-35), triazine hydrolases (Raillard£t al.<br>
2001. Chem Biol 8(9):891-898), murine leukemia virus (MLV) proteins (Powell et al. 2000,<br>
Nat Biotechnol 18(12): 1279-1282), and indoleglycerol phosphate synthase (Merz et al. 2000.<br>
Biochemistry 39(5):880-889).<br>
The technique of DNA shuffling was developed to generate biomolecular diversity by<br>
mimicking natural recombination by allowing in vitro homologous recombination of DNA<br>
(Stemmler, 1994. Nature 370: 389-391; and Stemmler. 1994, PNAS91: 10747-10751).<br>
Generally, in this method a population of related genes is fragmented and subjected to<br>
recursive cycles of denaturation, rehybridization, followed by the extension of the 5'<br>
overhangs by Taq polymerase. With each cycle, the length of the fragments increases, and<br>
DNA recombination occurs when fragments originating from different genes hybridize lo<br>
each other. The initial fragmentation of the DNA is usually accomplished by nuclease<br>
digestion, typically using DNase (see Stemmler references, above), but may also be<br>
accomplished by interrupted PCR synthesis (U.S. Patent 5.965,408, incorporated herein by<br>
reference in its entirety; see. Diversa Corp., San Diego, CA). DNA shuffling methods have<br>
advantages over random point mutation methods in that direct recombination of beneficial<br>
mutations generated by each round of shuffling is achieved and there is therefore a self<br>
selection for improved phenotypes of peptides.<br>
The techniques of DNA shuffling are well known to those in art. Detailed<br>
explanations of such technology is found in Stemmler, 1994, Nature 370: 389-391 and<br>
Stemmler. 1994. PNAS 91: 10747-10751. The DNA shuffling technique is also described in<br>
U.S. Patents 6,180,406. 6,165.793, 6,132,970, 6,117,679. 6,096,548, 5.837,458, 5,834,252,<br>
5.830,721. 5.811.238. and 5.605,793 (all of which are incorporated by reference herein in<br>
their entirety) .<br>
The art also provides even more recent modifications of the basic technique of DNA<br>
shuffling. In one example, exon shuffling, exons or combinations of exons that encode<br>
specific domains of peptides are amplified using chimeric oligonucleotides. The amplified<br>
molecules are then recombined by self-priming PCR assembly (Kolkman and Stemmler.<br>
2001. Nat. Biotech. 19:423-428). In another example, using the technique of random<br>
chimeragenesis on transient templates (RACHITT) library construction, single stranded<br>
parental DNA fragments are annealed onto a full-length single-stranded template (Coco et al.,<br>
2001, Nat. Biotechnol. 19:354-359). In yet another example, staggered extension process<br>
(StEP). thermocycling with very abbreviated annealing/extension cycles is employed to<br>
repeatedly interrupt DNA polymerization from flanking primers (Zhao et al., 1998, Nat.<br>
Biotechnol. 16: 258-261). In the technique known as CLERY. in vitro family shuffling is<br>
combined with in vivo homologous recombination in yeast (Abecassis et al.. 2000, Nucleic<br>
Acids Res. 28:E88:). To maximize intergenic recombination, single stranded DNA from<br>
complementary strands of each of the nucleic acids are digested with DNase and annealed<br>
(Kikuchi et al., 2000, Gene 243:133-137). The blunt ends of two truncated nucleic acids of<br>
variable lengths that are linked by a cleavablc sequence are then ligated to generate gene<br>
fusion without homologous recombination (Sieber et al., 2001. Nat Biotechnol. 19:456-460;<br>
Lutz et al., 2001, Nucleic Acids Res. 29:E16; Ostermeier et al., 1999, Nat. Biotechnol.<br>
17:1205-1209; Lutz and Benkovic, 2000, Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 11:319-324).<br>
Recombination between nucleic acids with little sequence homology in common has also<br>
been enhanced using exonuclease-mediated blunt-ending of DNA fragments and ligating the<br>
fragments together to recombine them (U.S. Patent No. 6,361,974, incorporated herein by<br>
reference in its entirety). The invention contemplates the use of each and every variation<br>
described above as a means of enhancing the biological properties of any of the peptides<br>
and/or enzymes useful in the methods of the invention.<br>
In addition to published protocols detailing directed evolution and gene shuffling<br>
techniques, commercial services are now available that will undertake the gene shuffling and<br>
selection procedures on peptides of choice. Maxygen (Redwood City, CA) offers<br>
commercial services to generate custom DNA shuffled libraries. In addition, this company<br>
will perform customized directed evolution procedures including gene shuffling and selection<br>
on a peptide family of choice.<br>
Optigenix, Inc. (Newark, DE) offers the related service of plasmid shuffling.<br>
Optigenix uses families of genes to obtain mutants therein having new properties. The<br>
nucleic acid of interest is cloned into a plasmid in an Aspergillus expression system. The<br>
DNA of the related family is then introduced into the expression system and recombination in<br>
conserved regions of the family occurs in the host. Resulting mutant DNAs are then<br>
expressed and the peptide produced therefrom are screened for the presence of desired<br>
properties and the absence of undesired properties.<br>
c. Screening procedures<br>
Following each recursive round of "evolution," the desired peptides expressed by<br>
mutated genes are screened for characteristics of interest. The "candidate" genes are then<br>
amplified and pooled for the next round of DNA shuffling. The screening procedure used is<br>
highly dependant on the peptide that is being "evolved" and the characteristic of interest.<br>
Characteristics such as peptide stability, biological activity, antigenicity, among others can be<br>
selected using procedures that are well known in the art. Individual assays for the biological<br>
activity of preferred peptides useful in the methods of the invention are described elsewhere<br>
herein.<br>
d. Combinations of techniques<br>
It will be appreciated by the skilled artisan that the above techniques of mutation and<br>
selection can be combined with each other and with additional procedures to generate the best<br>
possible peptide molecule useful in the methods of the invention. Thus, the invention is not<br>
limited to any one method for the generation of peptides, and should be construed to<br>
encompass any and all of the methodology described herein. For example, a procedure for<br>
introducing point mutations into a nucleic acid sequence may be performed initially, followed<br>
by recursive rounds oI'DNA shuffling, selection and amplification. The initial introduction<br>
of point mutations may be used to introduce diversity into a gene population where it is<br>
lacking, and the following round of DNA shuffling and screening will select and recombinc<br>
advantageous point mutations.<br>
111. Glycosidases and Glycotransferases<br>
A. Glycosidases<br>
Glycosidases are glycosyltransferases that use water as an acceptor molecule, and as<br>
such, arc typically glycoside-hydrolytic enzymes. Glycosidases can be used for the formation<br>
of glycosidic bonds in vitro by controlling the thermodynamics or kinetics of the reaction<br>
mixture. Even with modified reaction conditions, though, glycosidase reactions can be<br>
difficult to work with, and glycosidases tend to give low synthetic yields as a result of the<br>
reversible transglycosylase reaction and the competing hydrolytic reaction.<br>
A glycosidase can function by retaining the stereochemistry at the bond being broken<br>
during hydrolysis or by inverting the stereochemistry at the bond being broken during<br>
hydrolysis, classifying the glycosidase as either a "retaining" glycosidase or an "inverting"'<br>
glycosidase, respectively. Retaining glycosidases have two critical carboxylic acid moieties<br>
present in the active site, with one carboxylate acting as an acid/base catalyst and the other as<br>
a nucleophile. whereas with the inverting glycosidases. one carboxylic acid functions as an<br>
acid and the other functions as a base.<br>
Methods to determine the activity and linkage specificity of any glycosidase are well<br>
known in the art, including a simplified HPLC protocol (Jacob and Scudder, 1994, Methods<br>
in linzymol. 230: 280-300). A general discussion of glycosidases and glycosidase treatment<br>
is found in Glycobiology. A Practical Approach, (1993, Fukuda and Kobata eds.. Oxford<br>
University Press Inc., New York).<br>
Glycosidases useful in the invention include, but are not limited to, sialidase, galactosidase,<br>
endoglycanase. mannosidase (i.e., a and ß Manl, Manll and ManIII,) xylosidase, fucosidase,<br>
Agrobaclerium sp. P-glucosidase, Cellulomonas flmi mannosidase 2A, Humicola insolens<br>
glycosidase. Sulfolohus solfularicus glycosidase and Bacillus licheniformis glycosidase.<br>
The choice of fucosidases for use in the invention depends on the linkage of the<br>
fucose to other molecules. The specificities of many a-fucosidases useful in the methods of<br>
the invention are well known to those in the art, and many varieties of fucosidase are also<br>
commercially available (Glyko, Novato, CA; PROzyme, San Leandro. CA; Calbiochem-<br>
Novabiochem Corp.. San Diego. CA; among others). a-Fucosidases of interest include, but<br>
are not limited to, a-fucosidases from Turbo cornuhts, Charonia lampas. Bacillus fulminans.<br>
Aspergillus niger. Clostridium perfringens. Bovine kidney (Glyko), chicken liver (Tyagarajan<br>
et al., 1996, Glycobiology 6:83-93) and a-fucosidase II from Xanthomonas maniholis (Glyko.<br>
PROzyme). Chicken liver fucosidase is particularly useful for removal of core fucosc from<br>
N-linked glycans.<br>
B. Glycosyltransfcrases<br>
Glycosyltransferases catalyze the addition of activated sugars (donor NDP-sugars). in<br>
a step-wise fashion, to a protein, glycopeptide, lipid or glycolipid or to the non-reducing end<br>
of a growing oligosaccharide. N-linked glycopeptides are synthesized via a transferase and a<br>
lipid-linked oligosaccharide donor Dol-PP-NAG2Glc3Man9 in an en block transfer followed<br>
by trimming of the core. In this case the nature of the "core" saccharide is somewhat<br>
different from subsequent attachments. A very large number of glycosyltransferases arc<br>
known in the art.<br>
The glycosyltransfcrase to be used in the present invention may be any as long as it<br>
can utilize the modified sugar as a sugar donor. Examples of such enzymes include Leloir<br>
pathway glycosyltransferases, such as galactosyltransferase, N-<br>
acetylglucosaminyltransferase, N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase, fucosyltransferase,<br>
sialyltransferasc. mannosyltransferase. xylosyltransferase. glucurononyltransferase and the<br>
like.<br>
For enzymatic saccharide syntheses that involve glycosyltransferase reactions,<br>
glycosyltransferases can be cloned, or isolated from any source. Many cloned<br>
glycosyltransferases arc known, as are their polynucleotide sequences. See, e.g., Taniguchi<br>
et al.. 2002, Handbook of glycosyltransferases and related genes, Springer. Tokyo.<br>
Glycosyltransferase amino acid sequences and nucleotide sequences encoding<br>
glycosyltransferases from which the amino acid sequences can be deduced are also found in<br>
various publicly available databases, including GenBank, Swiss-Prot, EMBL, and others.<br>
Glycosyltransferases that can be employed in the methods of the invention include,<br>
but are not limited to. galactosyltransfcrases, fucosyltransfcrases, glucosyltransferases. N-<br>
acetylgalactosaminyltransferases. N-acetylglucosaminyltransferases, glucurony (transferases,<br>
sialyltransferases. mannosyltransferases. glucuronic acid transferases, galacturonic acid<br>
transferases, and oligosaccharyltransferases. Suitable glycosyltransferases include those<br>
obtained from eukaryotes. as well as from prokaryotes.<br>
DNA encoding glycosyltransferases may be obtained by chemical synthesis, by<br>
screening reverse transcripts of mRNA from appropriate cells or cell line cultures, by<br>
screening genomic libraries from appropriate cells, or by combinations of these procedures.<br>
Screening of mRNA or genomic DNA may be carried out using oligonucleotide probes<br>
generated from the glycosyltransferases nucleic acid sequence. Probes may be labeled with a<br>
detectable label, such as, but not limited to, a fluorescent group, a radioactive atom or a<br>
chemiluminescent group in accordance with known procedures and used in conventional<br>
hybridization assays. In the alternative, glycosyltransferases nucleic acid sequences may be<br>
obtained by use of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) procedure, with the PCR<br>
oligonucleotide primers being produced from the glycosyltransferases nucleic acid sequence.<br>
See, U.S. Pat. No. 4.683,195 to Mullis et al. and U.S. Pat. No. 4,683,202 to Mullis.<br>
A glycosyltransferases enzyme may be synthesized in a host cell transformed with a<br>
vector containing DNA encoding the glycosyltransferases enzyme. A vector is a replicablc<br>
DNA construct. Vectors are used either to amplify DNA encoding the glycosyltransferases<br>
enzyme and/or to express DNA which encodes the glycosyltransferases enzyme. An<br>
expression vector is a replicable DNA construct in which a DNA sequence encoding the<br>
glycosyltransferases enzyme is operably linked to suitable control sequences capable of<br>
effecting the expression of the glycosyltransferases enzyme in a suitable host. The need for<br>
such control sequences will vary depending upon the host selected and the transformation<br>
method chosen. Generally, control sequences include a transcriptional promoter, an optional<br>
operator sequence to control transcription, a sequence encoding suitable mRNA ribosomal<br>
binding sites, and sequences which control the termination of transcription and translation.<br>
Amplification vectors do not require expression control domains. All that is needed is the<br>
ability to replicate in a host, usually conferred by an origin of replication, and a selection<br>
tzene to facilitate rccosznition of transformants.<br>
1. Fucosyltransferases<br>
In some embodiments, a glycosyltransferase used in the method of the invention is a<br>
fucosyltransferase. Fucosyltransferases are known to those of skill in the art. Exemplary<br>
fucosyltransferases include enzymes, which transfer L-fucose from GDP-fucose to a hydroxy<br>
position of an acceptor sugar. Fucosyltransferases that transfer from non-nuclcotide sugars to<br>
an acceptor are also of use in the present invention.<br>
In some embodiments, the acceptor sugar is, for example, the GlcNAc in a<br>
Gaip(l ?3,4)GlcNAcP- group in an oligosaccharide glycoside. Suitable fucosyltransferases<br>
for this reaction include the Gal[3(l?3.4)GlcNAcß1-a(l?3,4)fucosyltransferase (FTIII E.G.<br>
No. 2.4.1.65), which was first characterized from human milk (see, Palcic, et al.,<br>
Carbohydrate Res. 190: 1-11 (1989); Prieels, et al., J. Biol. Chem. 256: 10456-10463(1981):<br>
and Nunez, et al., Can. J. Chem. 59: 2086-2095 (1981)) and the Galß(l?4)GleNAcP-<br>
afucosyltransferases (FTIV, FTV, FTVI) which are found in human serum. FTVII (E.G. No.<br>
2.4.1.65), a sialyl a(2?3)Gaiß((l?3)GlcNAcß fucosyltransferase, has also been<br>
characterized. A recombinant form of the Galß(l ?3,4) GlcNAcP-<br>
rx(l?3.4)fucosyltransferase has also been characterized (see, Dumas, et al.. Bioorg. Med.<br>
Letters 1: 425-428 (1991) and Kukowska-Latallo, et al., Genes and Development 4: 1288-<br>
1303 (1990)). Other exemplary fucosyltransferases include, for example, a 1,2<br>
fucosyltransferase (E.C. No. 2.4.1.69). Enzymatic fucosylation can be carried out by the<br>
methods described in Mollicone, et al., Eur. J. Biochem. 191: 169-176 (1990) or U.S. Patent<br>
No. 5,374.655.<br>
2. Galactosyltransferases<br>
In another group of embodiments, the glycosyltransferase is a galactosyltransferase.<br>
Exemplary galactosyltransferases include a(l,3) galactosyltransferases (E.G. No. 2.4.1.151,<br>
see. e.g.. Dabkowski et al.. Transplant Proc. 25:2921 (1993) and Yamamoto et al. Nature 345:<br>
229-233 (1990), bovine (GenBank J04989, Joziasse et al., J. Biol. Chem. 264: 14290-14297<br>
(1989)), murine (GenBank m26925; Larsen et al., Proc. Nat'l. Acad. Sci. USA 86: 8227-8231<br>
(1989)). porcine (GenBank L36152; Strahan et al., Immunogenetics 41: 101-105 (1995)).<br>
Another suitable a 1,3 galactosyltransferase is that which is involved in synthesis of the blood<br>
group B antigen (EC 2.4.1.37. Yamamoto et al., J Biol. Chem. 265: 1146-1151 (1990)<br>
(human)).<br>
Also suitable for use in the methods of the invention are P(1.4) galactosyltransferases.<br>
which include, for example, EC 2.4.1.90 (LacNAc synthetase) and EC 2.4.1.22 (lactose<br>
synthetase) (bovine (D'Agostaro et al., Eur. J. Biochem. 183: 211-217(1989)), human (Masri<br>
et al., Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 157: 657-663 (1988)), murine (Nakazawa et al.. J.<br>
Biochem. 104: 165-168 (1988)), as well as E.G. 2.4.1.38 and the ceramide<br>
galactosyltransferase (EC 2.4.1.45. Stahl etal., J. Neurosci. Res. 38: 234-242 (1994)). Other<br>
suitable galactosyltransferases include, for example, a1,2 galactosyltransferases (from e.g.,<br>
Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Chapell et al., Mol. Biol. Cell 5: 519-528 (1994)). For further<br>
suitable galactosyltransferases, see Taniguchi et al. (2002, Handbook of Glycosyltransferases<br>
and Related Genes, Springer, Tokyo), Guo et al. (2001. Glycobiology, 11 (10):813-820), and<br>
Breton etal. (1998,.I Biochem. 123:1000-1009).<br>
The production of proteins such as the enzyme GalNAc TI-XIV from cloned genes by<br>
genetic engineering is well known. Sec, e.g.. U.S. Pat. No. 4,761,371. One method involves<br>
collection of sufficient samples, then the amino acid sequence of the enzyme is determined<br>
by N-terminal sequencing. This information is then used to isolate a cDNA clone encoding a<br>
full-length (membrane bound) transferase which upon expression in the insect cell line Sf9<br>
resulted in the synthesis of a fully active enzyme. The acceptor specificity of the enzyme is<br>
then determined using a semiquantitative analysis of the amino acids surrounding known<br>
glycosylation sites in 16 different proteins followed by in vitro glycosylation studies of<br>
synthetic peptides. This work has demonstrated that certain amino acid residues are<br>
overrepresented in glycosylated peptide segments and that residues in specific positions<br>
surrounding glycosylated serine and threonine residues may have a more marked influence on<br>
acceptor efficiency than other amino acid moieties.<br>
3. Sialyltransferases<br>
Sialyltransferases arc another type of glycosyltransferase that is useful in the<br>
recombinant cells and reaction mixtures of the invention. Examples of sialyltransferases that<br>
are suitable for use in the present invention include ST3Gal III (e.g., a rat or human ST3Gal<br>
III). ST3Gal IV. ST3Gal I, ST6Gal I, ST3Gal V. ST6Gal II. ST6GalNAc I. ST6GalNAc II.<br>
and ST6GalNAc III (the sialyltransferase nomenclature used herein is as described in Tsuji et<br>
al. Glycobiologv 6: v-\iv (1996)). An exemplary a(2,3)sialyltransfcrasc referred to as<br>
u(2.3)sialyltransferasc (EC 2.4.99.6) transfers sialic acid to the non-reducing terminal Gal of<br>
a Galß1?3Glc disaccharidc or glycoside. See, Van den Eijnden et al., J. Biol. Chem. 256:<br>
3159 (1981), Weinstein et al.. J. Biol. Chem. 257: 13845 (1982) and Wen et al.. J. Biol.<br>
Chem. 267: 21011 (1992). Another exemplary a2,3-sialyltransferase (EC 2.4.99.4) transfers<br>
sialic acid to the non-reducing terminal Gal of the disaccharide or glycoside, see, Rearick et<br>
al.. J. Biol. Chem. 254: 4444 (1979) and Gillespie et al., J. Biol. Chem. 267: 21004 (1992).<br>
Further exemplary enzymes include Gal-P-l,4-GlcNAc a-2,6 sialyltransferase (See,<br>
Kurosawa et al. Eur. J. Biochem. 219: 375-381 (1994)).<br>
Preferably, for glycosylation of carbohydrates of glycopeptides the sialyltransferase<br>
will be able to transfer sialic acid to the sequence Ga1ß1,4GlcNAc-, Galpl,3GlcNAc-. or<br>
Ga1ß1.3GalNAc-. the most common penultimate sequences underlying the terminal sialic<br>
acid on fully sialylated carbohydrate structures (see, Table 8). a2.8-Sialyltransferases<br>
capable of transfering sialic acid to a2,3Ga1ß1,4GlcNAc are also useful in the methods of the<br>
invention.<br>
An example of a sialyltransferase that is useful in the claimed methods is ST3Gal III,<br>
which is also referred to as a(2.3)sialyltransferase (IX 2.4.99.6). This enzyme catalyzes the<br>
transfer of sialic acid to the Gal of a Galß1.3GlcNAc or Galpl,4GlcNAc glycoside (see. e.g..<br>
Wen et al., J. Biol. Chem. 267: 21011(1992): Van den Eijnden et al., J. Biol. Chem. 256:<br>
3159 (1991)) and is responsible for sialylation of asparagine-linked oligosaccharides in<br>
glycopeptides. The sialic acid is linked to a Gal with the formation of an a-linkage between<br>
the two saccharides. Bonding (linkage) between the saccharides is between the 2-position of<br>
NeuAc and the 3-position of Gal. This particular enzyme can be isolated from rat liver<br>
(Weinstcin et al., J. Biol. Chem. 257: 13845 (1982)); the human cDNA (Sasaki et al. (1993)<br>
J. Biol. Chem. 268: 22782-22787; Kitagawa &amp; Paulson (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269: 1394-<br>
1401) and genomic (Kitagawa et al. (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271: 931-938) DNA sequences are<br>
known, facilitating production of this enzyme by recombinant expression. In a preferred<br>
embodiment, the claimed sialylation methods use a rat ST3Gal III.<br>
An example of a sialyltransferase that is useful in the claimed methods is CST-I from<br>
Campylobacter (see .for example, U.S. Pat. No. 6.503744, 6,096,529, and 6,210933 and<br>
WO99/49051, and published U.S. Pat. Application 2002/2,042,369). This enzyme catalyzes<br>
the transfer of sialic acid to the Gal of aGa1ß1.4Glc or Galpl,3GalNAc. Other exemplary<br>
sialyltransferases of use in the present invention include those isolated from Campylobacter<br>
jejuni, including the a(2,3) sialyltransferase. See, e.g. WO99/49051.<br>
Other sialyltransferases, including those listed in Table 8. are also useful in an<br>
economic and efficient large-scale process for sialylation of commercially important<br>
glycopeptides. As a simple test to find out the utility of these other enzymes, various<br>
amounts of each enzyme (1-100 mU/mg protein) are reacted with asialo-a1 AGP (at 1-10<br>
mg/ml) to compare the ability of the sialyltransferase of interest to sialylate glycopeptides<br>
relative to either bovine ST6Gal I, ST3Gal III or both sialyltransferases. Alternatively, other<br>
glycopeptides or glycopeptides, or N-linked oligosaccharides enzymatically released from the<br>
peptide backbone can be used in place of asialo-a1 AGP for this evaluation.<br>
Sialyltransferases with the ability to sialylate N-linked oligosaccharides of glycopeptides<br>
more efficiently than ST6Gal I are useful in a practical large-scale process for peptide<br>
sialylation (as illustrated for ST3Gal III in this disclosure).<br>
4. Other glyeosyltransferases<br>
One of skill in the an will understand that other glyeosyltransferases can be<br>
substituted into similar transferase cycles as have been described in detail for the<br>
sialyltransferase. In particular, the glycosyltransferase can also be. for instance,<br>
glucosyltranslerases, e.g., Alg8 (Stagljov et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 91: 5977(1994))<br>
or Alg5 (Heescn et al.. fiur. J. Biochem. 224: 71 (1994)).<br>
N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferases are also of use in practicing the present invention.<br>
Suitable N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferases include, but are not limited to, oc(I.3) N-<br>
acetylgalactosaminyltransferase,ß(1,4) N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferases (Nagata et al.. J.<br>
Biol. Chem. 267: 12082-12089 (1992) and Smith et al., J. Biol Chem. 269: 15162 (1994))<br>
and peptide N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase (Homa et al., J. Biol. Chem. 268: 12609<br>
(1993)). Suitable N-acetylglucosaininyltransferases include GnT-I (2.4.1.101. Hull et al..<br>
BBRC 176: 608 (1991)), GnT-11, GnT-III (Ihara et al., J. Biochem. 113: 692 (1993)), GnT-<br>
IV, GnT-V (Shoreibah et al., J. Biol. Chem. 268: 15381 (1993)) and GnT-VI. O-Iinkcd N-<br>
acetylglucosaminyltransferase (Bierhuizen et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89: 9326<br>
(1992)), N-acetylglucosamine-1 -phosphate transferase (Rajput et al., Biochem J. 285: 985<br>
(1992). and hyaluronan synthase.<br>
Mannosyltransferases are of use to transfer modified mannose moieties. Suitable<br>
mannosyltransferases include a(l,2) mannosyltransferase. a(1,3) mannosyltransferase. a(1,6)<br>
mannosyltransferase.ß(1,4) mannosyltransferase, Dol-P-Man synthase, OChl, and Pmtl<br>
(sec. Kornfeld et al.. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 54: 631-664 (1985)).<br>
Xylosyltransferases are also useful in the present invention. See. for example,<br>
Rodgers, et al., Biochem. J., 288:817-822 (1992); and Elbain, et al., U.S. Patent No.,<br>
6,168,937.<br>
Other suitable glycosyltransferase cycles are described in Ichikawa et al., JACS 114:<br>
9283 (1992), Wong et al., J. Org. Chem. 57: 4343 (1992), and Ichikawa et al. in<br>
Carbohydrails and Carbohydratf. Polymkrs. Yaltami, ed. (ATL Press. 1993).<br>
Prokaryotic glyeosyltransferases are also useful in practicing the invention. Such<br>
glyeosyltransferases include enzymes involved in synthesis of lipooligosaccharides (LOS),<br>
which are produced by many gram negative bacteria. The I.OS typically have terminal<br>
glycan sequences that mimic glycoconjugates found on the surface of human epithelial cells<br>
or in host secretions (Preston et al.. Critical Reviews in Microbiology 23(3): 139-180 (1996)).<br>
Such enzymes include, but are not limited to, the proteins of the rfa operons of species such<br>
as E. coli and Salmonella typhimurium, which include a ß1,6 galactosyltransfcrase and a ß1.3<br>
galactosyltransferase (see. e.g., EMBL Accession Nos. M80599 and M86935 (E. coli):<br>
LMBL Accession No. S56361 (S. typhimurium)), a glucosyltransferase (Swiss-Prot<br>
Accession No. P25740 (E. coli), an ß1,2-glucosyltransferase (rfaJ)(Swiss-Prot Accession No.<br>
P27129 (E. coli) and Swiss-Prot Accession No. PI9817 (S. typhimurium)), and an B1.2-N-<br>
acetylglucosaminyltransferase (rfaK)(EMBL Accession No. U00039 (E. coli). Other<br>
glycosyltransferases for which amino acid sequences are known include those that arc<br>
encoded by operons such as rfaB, which have been characterized in organisms such as<br>
Klebsiella pneumoniae. E. coli. Salmonella typhimurium, Salmonella enterica, Yersinia<br>
enterocolitica, Mycobacterium leprosum, and the rhl operon of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.<br>
Also suitable for use in the present invention are glycosyltransferases that are<br>
involved in producing structures containing lacto-N-neotetraose, D-galactosyl-p-l,4-N-<br>
acctyl-D-glucosaminyl-ß-l,3-D-galactosyl-ß-l,4-D-glucose, and the Pk blood group<br>
trisaccharide sequence, D-galactosyl-a-1.4-D-galactosyl-p-l,4-D-glucose, which have been<br>
identified in the I.OS of the mucosal pathogens Neisseria gonnorhoeae and ;V. meningitidis<br>
(Scholten et al., J. Med. Microbiol. 41: 236-243 (1994)). The genes from N. meningitidis and<br>
N, gonorrhoeae that encode the glycosyltransferases involved in the biosynthesis of these<br>
structures have been identified from A', meningitidis immunotypes L3 and LI (Jennings et al..<br>
Mol. Microbiol. 18: 729-740 (1995)) and the N. gonorrhoeae mutant F62 (Gotshlich. J. Exp.<br>
Med. 180: 2181 -2190 (1994)). In A", meningitidis, a locus consisting of three genes, IgtA,<br>
IglB and Ig E, encodes the glycosyltransferase enzymes required for addition of the last three<br>
of the sugars in the lacto-A'-neotetraose chain (Wakarchuk et al., J. Biol. Chem. 271: 19166-<br>
73 (1996)). Recently the enzymatic activity of the IgtB and IgtA gene product was<br>
demonstrated, providing the first direct evidence for their proposed glycosyltransferase<br>
function (Wakarchuk et al.. J. Biol. Chem. 271(45): 28271-276 (1996)). In .V. gonorrhoeae.<br>
there are two additional genes. lgtD which adds P-D-GalNAc to the 3 position of the terminal<br>
galactose of the lacto-A'-neotetraose structure and lgtC which adds a terminal a-D-Gal to the<br>
lactose element of a truncated LOS, thus creating the Pk blood group antigen structure<br>
(Gotshlich (1994). supra.). In A', meningitidis, a separate immunotype LI also expresses the<br>
P blood group antigen and has been shown to carry an IgtC gene (Jennings et al., (1995).<br>
supra.). Neisseria glvcosyltransferases and associated genes are also described in USPN<br>
5.545.553 (Gotschlich). Genes for a1,2-fucosyltransferase and a1,3-fucosyltransferase from<br>
Helicobacter pylori has also been characterized (Martin et al., J. Biol. Chem. 272: 21349-<br>
21356 (1997)). Also of use in the present invention are the glycosyltransferases of<br>
Campylobacter jejuni {see, Taniguchi et al., 2002, Handbook of glycosyltransferases and<br>
related genes. Springer. Tokyo).<br>
B. Sulfotransferases<br>
The invention also provides methods for producing peptides that include sulfated<br>
molecules, including, for example sulfated polysaccharides such as heparin, heparan sulfate,<br>
carragenen, and related compounds. Suitable sulfotransferases include, for example,<br>
chondroitin-6-sulphotransferase (chicken cDNA described by Fukuta et al., J. Biol. Chem.<br>
270: 18575-18580 (1995): GenBank Accession No. D49915), glycosaminoglycan N-<br>
acetylglucosamine N-deacetylase/N-sulphotransferase 1 (Dixon et al.. Genomics 26: 239-241<br>
(1995); UL18918). and glycosaminoglycan N-acetylglucosamine N-deacetylase/N-<br>
sulphotransferase 2 (murine cDNA described in Orellana et al., J. Biol. Chem. 269: 2270-<br>
2276 (1994) and Eriksson et al., J. Biol. Chem. 269: 10438-10443 (1994); human cDNA<br>
described in GenBank Accession No. U2304).<br>
C. Cell-Bound Glycosyltransferases<br>
In another embodiment, the enzymes utilized in the method of the invention are cell-<br>
bound glycosyltransferases. Although many soluble glycosyltransferases are known (see, for<br>
example. U.S. Pat. No. 5.032,519), glycosyltransferases are generally in membrane-bound<br>
form when associated with cells. Many of the membrane-bound enzymes studied thus far are<br>
considered to be intrinsic proteins; that is, they are not released from the membranes by<br>
sonication and require detergents for solubilization. Surface glycosyltransferases have been<br>
identified on the surfaces of vertebrate and invertebrate cells, and it has also been recognized<br>
that these surface transferases maintain catalytic activity under physiological conditions.<br>
However, the more recognized function of cell surface glycosyltransferases is for intercellular<br>
recognition (Roth, 1990, Molecular Approaches to Supracellular Phenomena,).<br>
Methods have been developed to alter the glycosyltransferases expressed by cells.<br>
For example. Larsen ct a!.. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 86: 8227-823 1 (1989), report a<br>
genetic approach to isolate cloned cDNA sequences that determine expression of cell surface<br>
oligosaccharide structures and their cognate glycosyltransferases. A cDNA library generated<br>
from mRNA isolated from a murine cell line known to express UDP-galactosc:.ß-D-<br>
galactosyl-l.4-N-acetyl-D-glucosaminide a-l,3-gaIactosyltransferase was transfected into<br>
COS-1 cells. The transfected cells were then cultured and assayed for a 1-3<br>
galactosyltransferase activity.<br>
Francisco etal., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89: 2713-2717 (1992). disclose a method<br>
of anchoring P-lactamase to the external surface of Escherichia coli. A tripartite fusion<br>
consisting of (i) a signal sequence of an outer membrane protein, (ii) a membrane-spanning<br>
section of an outer membrane protein, and (iii) a complete mature P-lactamase sequence is<br>
produced resulting in an active surface bound P-lactamase molecule. However, the Francisco<br>
method is limited only to prokaryotic cell systems and as recognized by the authors, requires<br>
the complete tripartite fusion for proper functioning.<br>
D. Fusion Bnzymes<br>
In other exemplary embodiments, the methods of the invention utilize fusion peptides<br>
that have more than one enzymatic activity that is involved in synthesis of a desired<br>
glycopeptide conjugate. The fusion peptides can be composed of, for example, a catalytically<br>
active domain of a glycosyltransferase that is joined to a catalytically active domain of an<br>
accessory enzyme. The accessory enzyme catalytic domain can, for example, catalyze a step<br>
in the formation of a nucleotide sugar that is a donor for the glycosyltransferase, or catalyze a<br>
reaction involved in a glycosyltransferase cycle. For example, a polynucleotide that encodes<br>
a glycosyltransferase can be joined, in-frame, to a polynucleotide that encodes an enzyme<br>
involved in nucleotide sugar synthesis. The resulting fusion peptide can then catalyze not<br>
only the synthesis of the nucleotide sugar, but also the transfer of the sugar moiety to the<br>
acceptor molecule. The fusion peptide can be two or more cycle enzymes linked into one<br>
expressible nucleotide sequence. In other embodiments the fusion ppeptide includes the<br>
catalytically active domains of two or more glycosyltransferases. See, for example, U.S.<br>
Patent No. 5,641,668. The modified glycopeptides of the present invention can be readily<br>
designed and manufactured utilizing various suitable fusion peptides (see, for example. PCT<br>
Patent Application PCT/CA98/01180, which was published as WO 99/31224 on June 24.<br>
1999.)<br>
E. Immobilized Enzymes<br>
In addition to cell-bound enzymes, the present invention also provides for the use of<br>
enzymes that are immobilized on a solid and/or soluble support. In an exemplary<br>
embodiment, there is provided a glycosyltransferase that is conjugated to a PEG via an intact<br>
glycosyl linker according to the methods of the invention. The PEG-linker-enzyme conjugate<br>
is optionally attached to solid support. The use of solid supported enzymes in the methods of<br>
the invention simplifies the work up of the reaction mixture and purification of the reaction<br>
product, and also enables the facile recovery of the enzyme. The glycosyltransferase<br>
conjugate is utilized in the methods of the invention. Other combinations of enzymes and<br>
supports will be apparent to those of skill in the art.<br>
E. Mutagenesis of Glycosyltransferases<br>
The novel forms of the glycosyltransferases. sialyltransferases, sulfotransferases. and<br>
any other enzymes used in the method of the invention can be created using any of the<br>
methods described previously, as well as others well known to those in the art. Of particular<br>
interest are transferases with altered acceptor specificity and/or donor specificity. Also of<br>
interest are enzymes with higher conversion rates and higher stability among others.<br>
The techniques of rational design mutagenesis can be used when the sequence of the<br>
peptide is known. Since the sequences as well as many of the tertiary structures of the<br>
transferases and glucosidases used in the invention are known, these enzymes are ideal for<br>
rational design of mutants. For example, the catalytic site of the enzyme can be mutated to<br>
alter the donor and/or acceptor specificity of the enzyme.<br>
The extensive tertiary structural data on the glycosyltransferases and glycosidase<br>
hydrolases also make these enzyme idea for mutations involving domain exchanges.<br>
Glycosyltransferases and glycosidase hydrolases are modular enzymes (see, Bourne and<br>
Henrissat, 2001. Current Opinion in Structural Biology 11:593-600). Glycosyltransferases<br>
are divided into two families bases on their structure: GT-A and GT-B. The<br>
glycosyltransferases of the GT-A family comprise two dissimilar domains, one involved in<br>
nucleotide binding and the other in acceptor binding. Thus, one could conveniently fuse the<br>
DNA sequence encoding the domain from one gene in frame with a domain from a second<br>
gene to create a new gene that encodes a protein with a new acceptor/donor specificity. Such<br>
exchanges of domains could additionally include the carbohydrate modules and other<br>
accessory domains.<br>
The techniques of random mutation and/or directed evolution, as described above,<br>
may also be used to create novel forms of the glycosyltransferases and glycosidases used in<br>
the invention.<br>
IV. In vitro and in vivo expression systems<br>
A. Cells for the production of glycopeptides<br>
The action of glycosyltransferases is key to the glycosylation of peptides, thus, the<br>
difference in the expression of a set of glycosyltransferases in any given cell type affects the<br>
pattern of glycosylation on any given peptide produced in that cell. For a review of host cell<br>
dependent glycosylation of peptides, see Kabata and Takasaki, "Structure and Biosynthesis of<br>
Cell Surface Carbohydrates," in Cell Surface Carbohydrates and Cell Development, 1991, pp.<br>
1-24. Eds. Minoru Fukuda. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL.<br>
According to the present disclosure, the type of cell in which the peptide is produced<br>
is relevant only with respect to the degree of remodeling required to generate a peptide<br>
having desired glycosylation. For example, the number and sequence of enzymatic digestion<br>
reactions and the number and sequence of enzymatic synthetic reactions that are required in<br>
vitro to generate a peptide having desired glycosylation will vary depending on the structure<br>
of the glycan on the peptide produced by a particular cell type. While the invention should in<br>
no way be construed to be limited to the production of peptides from any one particular cell<br>
type including any cell type disclosed herein, a discussion of several cell systems is now<br>
presented which establishes the power of the present invention and its independence of the<br>
cell type in which the peptides are generated.<br>
In general, and to express a peptide from a nucleic acid encoding it. the nucleic acid<br>
must be incorporated into an expression cassette, comprising a promoter element, a<br>
terminator element, and the coding sequence of the peptide operably linked between the two.<br>
The expression cassette is then operably linked into a vector. Toward this end, adapters or<br>
linkers may be employed to join the nucleotide fragments or other manipulations may be<br>
involved to provide for convenient restriction sites, removal of superfluous nucleotides,<br>
removal of restriction sites, or the like. For this purpose, in vitro mutagenesis, primer repair,<br>
restriction, annealing, resubstitutions, e.g., transitions and transversions, may be involved. A<br>
shuttle vector has the genetic elements necessary for replication in a cell. Some vectors may<br>
be replicated only in prokaryotes, or may be replicated in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes.<br>
Such a plasmid expression vector will be maintained in one or more replication systems,<br>
preferably two replication systems, that allow for stable maintenance within a yeast host cell<br>
for expression purposes, and within a prokaryotic host for cloning purposes. Many vectors<br>
with diverse characteristics are now available commercially. Vectors are usually plasmids or<br>
phages, but may also be cosmids or mini-chromosomes. Conveniently, many commercially<br>
available vectors will have the promoter and terminator of the expression cassette already<br>
present, and a multi-linker site where the coding sequence for the peptide of interest can be<br>
inserted. The shuttle vector containing the expression cassette is then transformed in E. coli<br>
where it is replicated during cell division to generate a preparation of vector that is sufficient<br>
to transform the host cells of the chosen expression system. The above methodology is well<br>
know to those in the art. and protocols by which to accomplish can be found Sambrook et al.<br>
(2001, Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, New<br>
York).<br>
The vector, once purified from the cells in which it is amplified, is then transformed<br>
into the cells of the expression system. The protocol for transformation depended on the kind<br>
of the cell and the nature of the vector. Transformants are grown in an appropriate nutrient<br>
medium, and, where appropriate, maintained under selective pressure to insure retention of<br>
endogenous DNA. Where expression is inducible, growth can be permitted of the yeast host<br>
to yield a high density of cells, and then expression is induced. The secreted, mature<br>
heterologous peptide can be harvested by any conventional means, and purified by<br>
chromatography, electrophoresis, dialysis, solvent-solvent extraction, and the like.<br>
The techniques of molecular cloning are well-known in the art. Further, techniques<br>
for the procedures of molecular cloning can be found in Sambrook et al. (2001, Molecular<br>
Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor.<br>
N.Y.); Glover et al., (1985, DNA Cloning: A Practical Approach, Volumes 1 and II); Gait et<br>

B. Fungi and yeast<br>
Peptides produced in yeast are glycosylated and the glycan structures present thereon<br>
are primarily high mannose structures. In the case of N-glycans, the glycan structures<br>
produced in yeast may contain as many as nine or more mannose residues which may or may<br>
not contain additional sugars added thereto. An example of the type of glycan on peptides<br>
produced by yeast cells is shown in Figure 4, left side. Irrespective of the number of<br>
mannose residues and the type and complexity of additional sugars added thereto, N-glycans<br>
as components of peptides produced in yeast cells comprise a trimannosyl core structure as<br>
shown in Figure 4. When the glycan structure on a peptide produced by a yeast cell is a high<br>
mannose structure, it is a simple matter for the ordinary skilled artisan to remove, in vitro<br>
using available mannosidase enzymes, all of the mannose residues from the molecule except<br>
for those that comprise the trimannosyl core of the glycan. thereby generating a peptide<br>
having an elemental trimannosyl core structure attached thereto. Now, using the techniques<br>
available in the art and armed with the present disclosure, it is a simple matter to<br>
en/ymatically add. in vitro, additional sugar moieties to the elemental trimannosyl core<br>
structure to generate a peptide having a desired glycan structure attached thereto. Similarly,<br>
when the peptide produced by the yeast cell comprises a high mannose structure in addition<br>
to other complex sugars attached thereto, it is a simple matter to enzymatically cleave off all<br>
of the additional sugars, including extra mannose residues, to arrive at the elemental<br>
trimannosyl core structure. Once the elemental trimannosyl core structure is produced,<br>
generation of a peptide having desired glycosylation is possible following the directions<br>
provided herein.<br>
By "yeast" is intended ascosporogenous yeasts (Endomycetales). basidiosporogenous<br>
yeasts, and yeast belonging to the Fungi Imperfecti (Blastomycetes). The ascosporogenous<br>
yeasts are divided into two families, Spermophthoraceae and Saccharomycetaceac. The later<br>
is comprised of four subfamilies, Schizosaccharomycoideae (e.g., genus<br>
Schizosaccharomyces), Nadsonioideae, Lipomycoideae, and Saccharomycoideae (e.g., genera<br>
Pichia. Klutyveromyces, and Saccharomyces). The basidiosporogenous yeasts include the<br>
genera I.eucosporiJium. Rhodosporidium. Sporidiobolas. Filobasidium, and Filobasidiella.<br>
Yeast belonging to the Fungi Imperfecti are divided into two families, Sporobolomycetaceae<br>
(e.g., genera Sporobolomyces, Bullera) and Cryptococcaceae (e.g., genus Candida). Of<br>
particular interest to the present invention are species within the genera Saccharomyces,<br>
Pichia, Aspergillus. Trichoderma, Kluyveromyces, especially AT. lactis and K. drosophilum,<br>
Candida, Hansenuht, Schizpsaccaromyces, Yarrowia, and Chrysoporium. Since the<br>
classification of yeast may change in the future, for the purposes of this invention, yeast shall<br>
be defined as described in Skinner et al., eds. 1980) Biology and Activities of Yeast (Soc.<br>
App. Bacteriol. Symp. Series No. 9).<br>
In addition to the foregoing, those of ordinary skill in the art are presumably familiar<br>
with the biology of yeast and the manipulation of yeast genetics. See, for example, Bacila et<br>
al.. eds. (1978, Biochemistry and Genetics of Yeast, Academic Press, New York); and Rose<br>
and Harrison. (1987. The Yeasts (2nd ed.) Academic Press, London). Methods of introducing<br>
exogenous DNA into yeast hosts are well known in the art. There are a wide variety of<br>
methods for transformation of yeast. Spheroplast transformation is taught by Hinnen et al<br>
(1978. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 75:1919-1933); Beggs, (1978, Nature 275(5676): 104-<br>
109): and Stinchcomb et al., (EPO Publication No. 45,573: herein incorporated by reference).<br>
Electroporation is taught by Becker and Gaurante, (1991, Methods Enzymol. 194:182-187),<br>
Lithium acetate is taught by Gietz et al. (2002, Methods Enzymol. 350:87-96) and Mount et<br>
al. (1996, Methods Mol Biol. 53:139-145). For a review of transformation systems of non-<br>
Saccharomyces yeasts, see Wangetal. (Crit Rev Biotechnol. 2001:21(3): 177-218). For<br>
general procedures on yeast genetic engineering, see Barr et al., (1989, Yeast genetic<br>
engineering, Butterworths, Boston).<br>
In addition to wild-type yeast and fungal cells, there are also strains of yeast and fungi<br>
that have been mutated and/or selected to enhance the level of expression of the exogenous<br>
gene, and the purity, the post-translational processing of the resulting peptide, and the<br>
recovery and purity of the mature peptide. Expression of an exogenous peptide may also be<br>
direct to the cell secretory pathway, as illustrated by the expression of insulin (see (Kjeldsen,<br>
2000, Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 54:277-286, and references cited therein). In general, to<br>
cause the exogenous peptide to be secreted from the yeast cell, secretion signals derived from<br>
yeast genes may be used, such as those of the genes of the killer toxin (Stark and Boyd. 1986.<br>
EM BO J. 5:1995-2002) or of the alpha phcromonc (Kurjan and Herskowitz, 1982. Cell 30:933;<br>
Brake et al.. 1988. Yeast 4:S436).<br>
Regarding the filamentous fungi in general, methods for genetic manipulation can be<br>
found in Kinghorn and Turner (1992, Applied Molecular Genetics of Filamentous Fungi,<br>
Blackie Academic and Professional, New York). Guidance on appropriate vectors can be<br>
found in Martinelli and Kinghorn (1994, Aspergillus : 50 years, Elsevier, Amsterdam).<br>
I. Saccharomvces<br>
In Saccharomyces, suitable yeast vectors for use producing a peptide include YRp7<br>
(Struhl et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 76: 1035-1039, 1978), YEpI 3 (Broach et al.. Gene<br>
8: 121-133, 1979). POT vectors (Kawasaki et al. U.S. Pat. No. 4,931,373, which is<br>
incorporated by reference herein), pJDB249 and pJDB219 (Beggs, Nature 275:104-108,<br>
1978) and derivatives thereof. Preferred promoters for use in yeast include promoters for<br>
yeast glycolytic gene expression (Hitzeman et al., J. Biol. Chem. 255: 12073-12080, 1980;<br>
Alberand Kawasaki, J. Mol. Appl. Genet. 1: 419-434, 1982; Kawasaki, U.S. Pat. No.<br>
4.599,311) or alcohol dehydrogenase genes (Young et al., in Genetic Engineering of<br>
Microorganisms for Chemicals. Hollaender et al., (eds.), p. 355, Plenum, New York. 1982;<br>
Ammerer. Meth. Enzymol. 101: 192-201. 1983), and the ADH2-4c promoter (Russell et al..<br>
Nature 304: 652-654, 1983; Irani and Kilgore, U.S. patent application Ser. No. 07/784,653,<br>
CA 1,304,020 and EP 284 044, which are incorporated herein by reference). The expression<br>
units may also include a transcriptional terminator. A preferred transcriptional terminator is<br>
the TP11 terminator (Alber and Kawasaki, ibid.).<br>
Examples of such yeast-bacteria shuttle vectors include Yep24 (Botstein et al. (1979)<br>
Gene 8:17-24; pCl (Brake et al. (1984) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 81:4642-4646), and<br>
Yrpl7 (Stnichomb et al. (1982) J. Mol. Biol. 158:157). Additionally, aplasmid expression<br>
vector may be a high or low copy number plasmid, the copy number generally ranging from<br>
about 1 to about 200. In the case of high copy number yeast vectors, there will generally be<br>
at least 10, preferably at least 20, and usually not exceeding about 150 copies of the vector in<br>
a single host. Depending upon the heterologous peptide selected, either a high or low copy<br>
number vector may be desirable, depending upon the effect of the vector and the recombinant<br>
peptide on the host. See. for example. Brake et al. (1984) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA<br>
81:4642-4646. DNA constructs of the present invention can also be integrated into the yeast<br>
genome by an integrating vector. Examples of such vectors are known in the art. See, for<br>
example. Botstein et al. (1979) Gene 8:17-24.<br>
The selection of suitable yeast and other microorganism hosts for the practice of the<br>
present invention is within the skill of the art. Of particular interest are the Saccharomyces<br>
species S. cerevisiae. S. carlsbergensis, S. diastaticus, S. douglasii, S. kluyveri, S. norbensis,<br>
and S. oviformis. When selecting yeast host cells for expression of a desired peptide, suitable<br>
host cells may include those shown to have, inter alia, good secretion capacity, low<br>
proteolytic activity, and overall vigor. Yeast and other microorganisms are generally<br>
available from a variety of sources, including the Yeast Genetic Stock Center. Department of<br>
Biophysics and Medical Physics, University of California, Berkeley, Calif.; and the American<br>
Type Culture Collection, Manassas VA. For a review, see Strathern et al., eds. (1981. The<br>
Molecular Biology of the Yeast Saccharomyces, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold<br>
Spring Harbor, N.Y.)<br>
Methods of introducing exogenous DNA into yeast hosts are well known in the art.<br>
2. Pichia<br>
The use of Pichia methanolica as a host cell for the production of recombinant<br>
peptides is disclosed in PCT Applications WO 97/17450, WO 97/17451, WO 98/02536, and<br>
WO 98/02565. DNA molecules for use in transforming P. methanolica are commonly<br>
prepared as double-stranded, circular plasmids, which are preferably linearized prior to<br>
transformation. For peptide production in P. methanolica, it is preferred that the promoter<br>
and terminator in the plasmid be that of a P. methanolica gene, such as a P. methanolica<br>
alcohol utilization gene (AUG1 or AUG2). Other useful promoters include those of the<br>
dihydroxyacetone synthase (DHAS), formate dehydrogenase (FMD), and catalase (CAT)<br>
genes, as well as those disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 5,252,726. To facilitate integration of the<br>
DNA into the host chromosome, it is preferred to have the entire expression segment of the<br>
plasmid flanked at both ends by host DNA sequences. A preferred selectable marker for use<br>
in Pichia methanolica is a P. methanolica ADE2 gene, which encodes phosphoribosyl-5-<br>
aminoimidazole carboxylase (A1RC; EC 4.1.1.21), which allows ade2 host cells to grow in<br>
the absence of adenine. For large-scale, industrial processes where it is desirable to minimize<br>
the use of methanol, host cells in which both methanol utilization genes (AUG1 and AUG2)<br>
are deleted are preferred. For production of secreted peptides, host cells deficient in vacuolar<br>
protease genes (PEP4 and PRBI) are preferred. Electroporation is used to facilitate the<br>
introduction of a plasm id containing DNA encoding a peptide of interest into P. methanolica<br>
cells. It is preferred to transform P. methanolica cells by electroporation using an<br>
exponential]) decaying, pulsed electric field having a field strength of from 2.5 to 4.5 kV/cm,<br>
preferably about 3.75 kV/cm, and a time constant (t) of from 1 to 40 milliseconds, most<br>
preferably about 20 milliseconds. For a review of the use of Pichia pastoris for large-scale<br>
production of antibody fragments, see Fischer et al., (1999, Biotechnol Appl Biochem. 30 ( Pt<br>
2): 1 17-120).<br>
3. Aspergillus<br>
Methods to express peptides in Aspergillus spp. are well known in the art, including<br>
but not limited to those described in Carrez et al., 1990, Gene 94:147-154; Contreras, 1991,<br>
Bio/Technology 9:378-381; Yelton et al.., 1984, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 81:1470-1474;<br>
Tilburnetal., 1983, Gene 26:205-221; Kelly and. Hynes, 1985, EMBO J. 4:475-479;<br>
Ballance et al., 1983. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 112:284-289; Buxton et al., 1985,<br>
Gene 37:207-214. and U.S. Pat. No. 4,935,349, incorporated by reference herein in its<br>
entirety. Examples of promoters useful in Aspergillus are found in U.S. Patent No.<br>
5.252,726. Strains of Aspergillus useful for peptide expression are found in U.S. Patent No.<br>
4,935.349. Commercial production of exogenous peptides is available from Novoenzymes<br>
for Aspergillus niger and Aspergillus oryzae.<br>
4. Trichoderma<br>
Trichoderma has certain advantages over other species of recombinant host cells for<br>
expression of desired peptides. This organism is easy to grow in large quantities and it has<br>
the ability to glycosylate and efficiently secrete high yields of recombinant mammalian<br>
peptides into the medium, making isolation of the peptide relatively easy. In addition, the<br>
glycosylation pattern on expressed peptides is more similar to that on human peptides than<br>
peptides expressed in many other systems. However, there are still differences in the glycan<br>
structures on expressed peptides from these cells. For example, terminal sialic acid residues<br>
are important to the therapeutic function of a peptide in a mammalian system, since the<br>
presence of these moieties at the end of the glycan structure impedes peptide clearance from<br>
the mammalian bloodstream. The mechanism behind the increased biologic half-life of<br>
sialylated molecules is believed to lie in their decreased recognition by lectins (Drickamer,<br>
1988. J. Biol. Chem. 263:9557-9560). However, in general fungal cells do not add terminal<br>
sialic acid residues to glycans on peptides, and peptides synthesized in fungal cells are<br>
therefore asialic. According to the present invention, this deficiency can be remedied using<br>
the in vitro glycan remodeling methods of the invention described in detail elsewhere herein.<br>
Trichoderma species useful as hosts for the production of peptides to be remodeled<br>
include T. reesei. such as QM6a, ALK02442 or CBS383.78 (Centraalbureau voor<br>
Schimmelcultures, Oosterstraat 1, PO Box 273, 3740 AG Baarn, The Netherlands, or.<br>
ATCC13631 (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas VA, 10852, USA, type); T.<br>
viride (such as CBS 189.79 (det. W. Gams); T. longibrachiatum, such as CBS816.68 (type);<br>
T. pseudokoningii (such as MUCL19358; Mycotheque de I'Universite Catholique de<br>
Louvain); T. saturnisporum CBS330.70 (type); T. harzianum CBS316.31 (det. W. Gams); T.<br>
virgatwn (T. pseudokoningii) ATCC24961. Most preferably, the host is T. reesei and more<br>
preferably, it is T. reesei strains QM94I4 (ATCC 26921), RUT-C-30 (ATCC 56765), and<br>
highly productive mutants such as VTT-D-79125, which is derived from QM9414<br>
(Nevalainen, Technical Research Centre of Finland Publications 26, (1985), Espoo, Finland).<br>
The transformation of Trichoderma with DNA is performed using any technique<br>
known in the art. including that taught in European patent No. EP0244234, Harkki (1989,<br>
Bio/Technology 7:596-601) and Uusitalo (1991, J. Biotech. 17:35-50). Culture of<br>
Trichoderma is supported by previous extensive experience in industrial scale fermentation<br>
techniques; for example, see Finkelstein, 1992, Biotechnology of Filamentous Fungi:<br>
Technology and Products, Butterworth-Heinemann, publishers, Stoneham, Mass.<br>
5. Kluyveromyces<br>
Yeast belonging to the genus Kluyveromyces have been used as host organisms for the<br>
production of recombinant peptides. Peptides produced by this genus of yeast are, in<br>
particular, chymosin (European Patent 96 430), thaumatin (European Patent 96 910),<br>
albumin, interleukin-1ß TPA, T1MP (European Patent 361 991) and albumin derivatives<br>
having a therapeutic function (European Patent 413 622). Species of particular interest in the<br>
genus Kluyveromyces include K. lactis.<br>
Methods of expressing recombinant peptides in Kluyvermyces spp. are well known in<br>
the art. Vectors for the expression and secretion of human recombinant peptides in<br>
Kluyvermyces are known in the art (Yeh, J. Cell. Biochem. Suppl. 14C:68, Abst. H402; Fleer.<br>
1990. Yeast 6 (Special Issue):S449) as are procedures for transformation and expression of<br>
recombinant peptides (Ito etal.. 1983, J. Bacterid. 153:163-168; van den Berg, 1990,<br>
Bio/Technology 8:135-139; U.S. Patent No. 5,633,146, WO8304050A1, EP0096910.<br>

6. Chrysoporium<br>
The fungal genus Chrysoporium has recently been used to expression of foreign<br>
recombinant peptides. A description of the proceedures by which one of skill in the art can<br>
use Chrysoporium can be used to express foreign peptides is found in WO 00/20555<br>

7. Others<br>
Methods for transforming Schwanniomyces are disclosed in European Patent 394<br>
538. Methods for transforming Acremonium chrysogenum are disclosed by U.S. Pat. No.<br>
5,162,228. Methods for transforming Neurospora are disclosed by U.S. Pat. No. 4,486,533.<br>
Also know is an expression system specifically for Schizosaccharomyces pombe (European<br>
Patent 385 391). General methods for expressing peptides in fission yeast.<br>
Schizosaccharomyces pombe can be found in Giga-Hama and Kumagai (1997. Foreign gene<br>
expression in fission yeast : Schizosaccharamyce s pombe. Springer, Berlin).<br>
C. Mammalian systems<br>
As discussed above, mammalian cells typically produce a heterogeneous mixture of<br>
N-glycan structures which vary with respect to the number and arrangement of additional<br>
sugars attached to the trimannosyl core. Typically, mammalian cells produce peptides having<br>
a complex glycan structure, such as that shown in Figure 3, right side. Using the methods of<br>
the present invention, a peptide produced in a mammalian cell may be remodeled in vitro to<br>
generate a peptide having desired glycosylation by first identifying the primary glycan<br>
structure and then determining which sugars must be removed in order to remodel the glycan<br>
structure. As discussed herein, the sugars to be removed will determine which cleavage<br>
enzymes will be used and thus, the precise steps of the remodeling process will vary<br>
depending on the primary glycan structure used as the initial substrate. A sample scheme for<br>
remodeling a glycan structure commonly produced in mammalian cells is shown in Figure 2.<br>
The N-glycan biosynthctic pathway in mammalian cells has been well characterized<br>
(reviewed in Moremen, 1994, Glycobiology 4:113-125). Many of the enzymes necessary for<br>
glycan synthesis have been identified, and mutant cell lines defective in this enzymatic<br>
pathway have been isolated including the Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell lines Lec23<br>
(defective in alpha-glucosidase I) and Led 8 (novel GlcNAc-TVIIl). The glycosylation<br>
pattern of peptides produced by these mutant cells is altered relative to normal CHO cells.<br>
As discussed herein, the glycosylation defects in these and other mutant cells can be<br>
exploited for the purposes of producing a peptide that lacks a complex glycan structure. For<br>
example, peptides produced by Lec23 cells lack sialic acid residues, and thus require less<br>
enzymatic manipulation in order to reduce the glycan structure to an elemental trimannosyl<br>
core or to Man3GlcNAc4. Thus, peptides produced in these cells can serve as preferred<br>
substrates for glycan remodeling. One of ordinary skill in the art could isolate or identify<br>
other glycosylation-defective cell lines based on known methods, for example the method<br>
described in Stanley et al., 1990, Somatic Cell Mol. Genet., 16: 211-223. Use of<br>
glycosylation-defective cell lines, those identified and as yet unidentified, is included in the<br>
invention for the purpose of generating preferred peptide substrates for the remodeling<br>
processes described herein.<br>
Expression vectors useful for expressing exogenous peptides in mammalian cells are<br>
numerous, and are well known to those in the art. Many mammalian expression vectors are<br>
now commercially available from companies, including Novagen. Inc (Madison. WI). Gene<br>
Therapy Systems (San Diego, CA), Promega (Madison, WI), ClonTech Inc. (Palo Alto, CA),<br>
and Stratagene (La Jolla, CA), among others.<br>
There are several mammalian cell lines that are particularly adept at expressing<br>
exogenous peptides. Typically mammalian cell lines originate from tumor cells extracted<br>
from mammals that have become immortalized, that is to say, they can replicate in culture<br>
essentially indeilnitely. These cell lines include, but are not limited to, CHO (Chinese<br>
hamster ovary, e.g. CHO-K1; ATCC No. CCL 61) and variants thereof, NSO (mouse<br>
myeloma), BNK, BHK 570 (ATCC No. CRL 10314), BHK (ATCC No. CRL 1632),<br>
Per.C6™ (immortalized human cells, Crucell N.V., Leiden, The Netherlands), COS-1 (ATCC<br>
No. CRL 1650), COS-7 (ATCC No. CRL 1651). HEK 293. mouse L cells. T lymphoid cell<br>
lines, BW5147 cells and MDCK (Madin-Darby canine kidney), HeLa (human), A549 (human<br>
lung carcinoma). 293 (ATCC No. CRL 1573; Graham et al.. 1977, Gen. Virol. 36:59-72).<br>
BGMK (Buffalo Green Monkey kidney), Hep-2 (human epidermoid larynx carcinoma), LLC-<br>
MK2 (African Green Monkey Kidney), McCoy, NCI-H292 (human pulmonary<br>
inucocpidermoid carcinoma tube), RD (rhabdomyosarcoma). Vero (African Green Monkey<br>
kidney), HEL (human embryonic lung), Human Fetal Lung-Chang, MRC5 (human<br>
embryonic lung), MRHF (human foreskin), and WI-38 (human embryonic lung). In some<br>
cases, the cells in which the therapeutic peptide is expressed may be cells derived from the<br>
patient to be treated, or they may be derived from another related or unrelated mammal. For<br>
example, fibroblast cells may be isolated from the mammal's skin tissue, and cultured and<br>
transformed in vitro. This technology is commercially available from Transkaryotic<br>
Therapies. Inc. (Cambridge, MA). Almost all currently used cell lines are available from the<br>
American Type Culture Collection (ATCC. Manassas, VA) and BioWhittaker (Walkersville.<br>
Maryland).<br>
Mammalian cells may be transformed with DNA using any one of several techniques<br>
that arc well known to those in the art. Such techniques include, but are not limited to.<br>
calcium phosphate transformation (Chen and Okayama, 1988 ; Graham and van der Eb.<br>
1973: Corsaro and Pearson, 1981, Somatic Cell Genetics 7:603), Diethylaminocthyl (DEAE)-<br>
dextran transfection (Fujita et al., 1986; Lopata et al., 1984; Selden et al., 1986,).<br>
electroporation (Neumann et al.. 1982. : Potter. 1988, ; Potter et al., 1984, : Wong and<br>
Neuman, 1982 ), cationic lipid reagent transfection (Elroy-Stein and Moss. 1990; Feigner et<br>
al.. 1987; Rose et al., 1991; Whitt et al., 1990; Hawley-Nelson et al., 1993, Focus 15:73;<br>

(Chaney et al, 1986: Kawai and Nishizawa, 1984). microinjection (Capecchi, 1980), and<br>
protoplast fusion (Rassoulzadegan et al.. 1982; Sandri-Goldin et al., 1981: Schaffer. 1980).<br>
among others. In general, see Sambrook et al. (2001, Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory<br>
Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory. New York) and Ausubel et al. (2002, Current<br>
Protocols in Molecular Biology, John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York) for transformation<br>
techniques.<br>
Recently the baculovirus system, popular for transformation of insect cells, has been<br>
adapted for stable transformation of mammalian cells (see, for review, Koat and Condrcay.<br>
2002, Trends Biotechnol. 20:173-180, and references cited therein). The production of<br>
recombinant peptides in cultured mammalian cells is disclosed, for example, in U.S. Pat. Nos.<br>
4.713.339, 4,784,950; 4.579,821; and 4,656,134. Several companies offer the services of<br>
transformation and culture of mammalian cells, including Cell Trends. Inc. (Middletown.<br>
MD). Techniques for culturing mammalian cells are well known in the art, and further found<br>
in l-lauscr et al. (1997. Mammalian Cell Biotechnology, Walter de Gruyer, Inc., Hawthorne,<br>
NY), and Sambrook et al. (2001, Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring<br>
Harbor and references cited therein.<br>
D. Insect<br>
Insect cells and in particular, cultured insect cells, express peptides having N-linked<br>
glycan structures that are rarely sialylated and usually comprise mannose residues which may<br>
or may not have additional fucose residues attached thereto. Examples of the types of glycan<br>
structures present on peptides produced in cultured insect cells are shown in Figure 6, and<br>
mannose glycans thereof. In this situation, there may or may not be a core fucose present,<br>
which if present, may be linked to the glycan via several different linkages.<br>
Raculovirus-mediated expression in insect cells has become particularly well-<br>
established for the production of recombinant peptides (Altmann et al., 1999, Glycoconjugate<br>
1. 16:109-123). With regard to peptide folding and post-translational processing, insect cells<br>
are second only to mammalian cell lines. I lowever, as noted above, N-glycosylation of<br>
peptides in insect cells differs in many respects from N-glycosylation in mammalian cells<br>
particularly in that insect cells frequently generate truncated glycan structures comprising<br>
oligosaccharides containing just three or sometimes only two mannose residues. These<br>
structures may be additionally substituted with fucose residues.<br>
According to the present invention, a peptide produced in an insect cell may be<br>
remodeled in vitro to generate a peptide with desired glycosylation by first optionally<br>
removing any substituted fucose residues using an appropriate fucosidase enzyme. In<br>
instances where the peptide comprises an elemental trimannosyl core structure following the<br>
removal of fucose residues, then all that is required is the in vitro addition of the appropriate<br>
sugars to the trimannosyl core structure to generate a peptide having desired glycosylation.<br>
In instances when the peptide might contain only two mannose residues in the glycan<br>
structure following removal of any fucose residues, a third mannose residue may be added<br>
using a mannosyltransferase enzyme and a suitable donor molecule such as GDP-mannose.<br>
and thereafter the appropriate residues are added to generate a peptide having desired<br>
glycosylation. Optionally, monoantennary glycans can also be generated from these species.<br>
Protocols for the use of baculovirus to transform insect cells are well known to those<br>
in the art. Several books have been published which provide the procedures to use the<br>
baculovirus system to express peptides in insect cells. These books include, but are not<br>
limited to, Richardson (Baculovirus Expression Protocols, 1998, Methods in Molecular<br>
Biology. Vol 39. Humana Pr), O'Reilly et al. (1994, Baculovirus Expression Vectors : A<br>
Laboratory Manual, Oxford Univ Press), and King and Possee (1992, The Baculovirus<br>
Expression System : A Laboratory Guide. Chapman &amp; Hall). In addition, there arc also<br>
publications such as Lucklow (1993, Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 4:564-572) and Miller (1993.<br>
Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 3:97-101).<br>

Insect cell lines of several different species origin are currently being used for peptide<br>
expression, and these lines are well known to those in the art. Insect cell lines of interest<br>
include, but are not limited to, dipteran and lepidopteran insect cells in general, Sf9 and<br>
variants thereof (fall armyworm Spodoptera frugiperda), Estigmene acrea, Trichoplusia ni,<br>
Bombyx mori, Malacosoma disstri. drosophila lines K.cl and SL2 among others, and<br>
mosquito.<br>
E. Plants<br>
Plant cells as peptide producers present a different set of issues. While N-linked<br>
glycans produced in plants comprise a trimannosyl core structure, this pentasaccharide<br>
backbone may comprise several different additional sugars as shown in Figure 5. For<br>
example, in one instance, the trimannosyl core structure is substituted by a (31,2 linked xylose<br>
residue and an ul.3 linked fucose residue. In addition, plant cells may also produce a<br>
Man5GlcNAc2 structure. Peptides produced in plant cells are often highly antigenic as a<br>
result of the presence of the core a1,3 fucose and xylose on the glycan structure, and are<br>
rapidly cleared from the blood stream when introduced into a mammal due to the absence of<br>
terminal sialic acid residues. Therefore, unless these peptides are remodeled using the<br>
methods provided herein, they are generally considered to be unsuitable as therapeutic agents<br>
in mammals. While some monoclonal antibodies expressed in plant cells were found to be<br>
non-immunogenic in mouse, it is likely that the glycan chains were not immunogenic because<br>
they were buried in the Fc region in these antibodies (Chargelegue et al., 2000, Transgenic<br>
Res. 9(3):187-194).<br>
Following the directions provided herein, it is now possible to generate a peptide<br>
produced in a plant cell wherein an increased number of the glycan structures present thereon<br>
comprise an elemental trimannosyl core structure, or a Man3GlcNAc4 structure. This is<br>
accomplished by cleaving off any additional sugars in vitro using a combination of<br>
appropriate glycosidases. including fucosidases. until the elemental trimannosyl core<br>
structure or the Man3GlcNAc4 structure is arrived at. These cleavage reactions should also<br>
include removal of any fucose or xylose residues from the structures in order to diminish the<br>
antigenicity of the final peptide when introduced into a mammal. Plant cells having<br>
mutations that inhibit the addition of fucose and xylose residues to the trimannosyl core<br>
structure are known in the art (von Schaewen et al., 1993, Plant Physiology 102:1109-1 1 18).<br>
The use of these cells to produce peptides having glycans which lack fucose and xylose is<br>
contemplated by the invention. Upon production of the elemental trimannosyl core or<br>
Man3GlcNAc4 structure, additional sugars may then be added thereto to arrive at a peptide<br>
having desired glycosylation that is therefore suitable for therapeutic use in a mammal.<br>
Transgenic plants are considered by many to be the expression system of choice for<br>
pharmaceutical peptides. Potentially, plants can provide a cheaper source of recombinant<br>
peptides. It has been estimated that the production costs of recombinant peptides in plants<br>
could be between 10 to 50 times lower that that of producing the same peptide in E. culi.<br>
While there arc slight differences in the codon usage in plants as compared to animals, these<br>
can be compensated for by adjusting the recombinant DNA sequences (sec, Kusnadi et al.,<br>
1997. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 56:473-484; Khoudi et al., 1999, Biotechnol. Bioeng. 135-143:<br>
Hood et al.. 1999. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 464:127-147). In addition, peptide synthesis,<br>
secretion and post-translational modification are very similar in plants and animals, with only<br>
minor differences in plant glycosylation (see. Fischer et al.. 2000, J. Biol. Regul. Homest.<br>
Agents 14: 83-92). Then, products from transgenic plants are also less likely to be<br>
contaminated by animal pathogens, microbial toxins and oncogenic sequences.<br>
The expression of recombinant peptides in plant cells is well known in the art. In<br>
addition to transgenic plants, peptides can also produced in transgenic plant cell cultures (Lee<br>
et al., 1997. Mol. Cell. 7:783-787), and non-transgenic plants inoculated with recombinant<br>
plant viruses. Several books have been published that describe protocols for the genetic<br>
transformation of plant cells: Potrykus (1995, Gene transfer to plants, Springer, New York),<br>
Nickoloff (1995, Plant cell electroporation and electrofusion protocols, Humana Press.<br>
Totowa. New York) and Draper (1988, Plant genetic transformation, Oxford Press, Boston).<br>
Several methods are currently used to stably transform plant cells with recombinant<br>
genetic material. These methods include, but are not limited to, Agrobacterium<br>
transformation (Bechtold and Pelletier, 1998; Escudero and Hohn. 1997: Hansen and Chilton,<br>
1999: Touraev et al.. 1997), biolistics (microprojectiles) (Finer et al.. 1999; Hansen and<br>
Chilton. 1999; Shilito. 1999), electroporation of protoplasts (Fromm et al., 1985, Ou-Lee et<br>
al.. 1986: Rhodes et al.. 1988; Saunders et al.. 1989; Trick et al., 1997), polyethylene glycol<br>
treatment (Shilito. 1999: Trick et al., 1997), inplanta mircroinjection (Leduc et al., 1996;<br>
Zhou et al., 1983), seed imbibition (Trick et al., 1997), laser beam (1996), and silicon carbide<br>
whiskers (Thompson et al.. 1995: U.S. Patent Appln. No. 20020100077, incorporated by<br>
reference herein in its entirety).<br>
Many kinds of plants are amenable to transformation and expression of exogenous<br>
peptides. Plants of particular interest to express the peptides to be used in the remodeling<br>
method of the invention include, but are not limited to, Arabidopsis thalliana. rapeseed<br>

If expression of the recombinant nucleic acid is desired in a whole plant rather than in<br>
cultured cells, plant cells are first transformed with DNA encoding the peptide, following<br>
which, the plant is regenerated. This involves tissue culture procedures that are typicailv<br>
optimized for each plant species. Protocols to regenerate plants are already well known in the<br>
art for many species. Furthermore, protocols for other species can be developed by one of<br>
skill in the art using routine experimentation. Numerous laboratory manuals are available<br>
that describe procedures for plant regeneration, including but not limited to, Smith (2000.<br>
Plant tissue culture : techniques and experiments, Academic Press, San Diego), Bhojwani and<br>
Razdan (1996, Plant tissue culture : theory and practice, Elsevier Science Pub., Amsterdam),<br>
Islam (1996, Plant tissue culture, Oxford &amp; IBH Pub. Co., New Delhi, India). Dodds and.<br>
Roberts ( 1995, Experiments in plant tissue culture. New York : Cambridge University Press.<br>
Cambridge England). Bhojwani (Plant tissue culture : applications and limitations, Elsevier,<br>
Amsterdam, 1990). Trigiano and Gray (2000, Plant tissue culture concepts and laboratory-<br>
exercises,. CRC Press, Boca Raton, Fla). and Lindsey (1991, Plant tissue culture manual :<br>
fundamentals and applications, Kluwer Academic, Boston).<br>
While purifying recombinant peptides from plants may potentially be costly, several<br>
systems have been developed to minimize these costs. One method directs the synthesized<br>
peptide to the seed endosperm from where it can easily extracted (Wright et al., 2001,<br>
Transgenic Res. 10:177-181, Guda et a... 2000. Plant Cell Res. 19:257-262; and U.S. Patent<br>
No. 5.767.379, which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety). An alternative<br>
approach is the co-extraction of the recombinant peptide with conventional plant products<br>
such as starch, meal or oil. In oil-seed rape, a fusion peptide of olcosin-hurudin when<br>
expressed in the plant, attaches to the oil body of the seed, and can be extracted from the<br>
plant seed along with the oil (Parmenter, 1995, Plant Mol. Biol. 29:1167-1 180; U.S. Patent<br>
Nos. 5.650.554, 5.792.922, 5.948.682 and 6,288,304, and US application 2002/0037303. all<br>
of which are incorporated in their entirely by reference herein). In a variation on this<br>
approach, the oleosin is fused to a peptide having affinity for the exogenous co-expressed<br>
peptide of interest (U.S. Patent No. 5,856,452, incorporated by reference herein in its<br>
entirety).<br>
Expression of recombinant peptides in plant plastids. such as the chioroplast.<br>
generates peptides having no glycan structures attached thereto, similar to the situation in<br>
prokaryotes. However, the yield of such peptides is vastly greater when expressed in these<br>
plant cell organelles, and thus this type of expression system may have advantages over other<br>
systems. For a general review on the technology for plastid expression of exogenous peptides<br>
in higher plants, sec Hager and Beck (2000, Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 54:302-310, and<br>
references cited therein). Plastid expression has been particularly successful in tobacco (see.<br>
for example, Staub et al.. 2000. Nat. Biotechnol. 18:333-338).<br>
F. Transgenic animals<br>
Introduction of a recombinant DNA into the fertilized egg of an animal (e.g., a<br>
mammal) may be accomplished using any number of standard techniques in transgenic<br>
animal technology. See. e.g., Hogan et al., Manipulating the Mouse Embryo: A Laboratory-<br>
Manual, Cold Spring I larbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y., 1986; and U.S.<br>
Pat. No. 5,811,634. which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. Most<br>
commonly, the recombinant DNA is introduced into the embryo by way of pronuclear<br>
microinjection (Gordon et al.. 1980. PNAS 77:7380-7384: Gordon and Ruddle. 1981. Science<br>
214:1244-1246: Brinster et al.. 1981, Cell 27:223-231; Costantini and Lacy, 1981. Nature<br>
294:92-94). Microinjection has the advantage of being applicable to a wide variety of<br>
species. Preimplantation embryos may also be transformed with retroviruses (Jaenisch and<br>
Mintz, 1974. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 71:1250-1254; Jaenisch et al., 1976. Hamatol<br>
Bluttransfus. 19:341-356; Stuhlmann et al.. 1984, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 81:7151-<br>
7155). Retroviral mediated transformation has the advantage of adding single copies of the<br>
recombinant nucleic acid to the cell, but it produces a high degree of mosaicism. Most<br>
recently, embryonic stem cell-mediated techniques have been used (Gossler et al.. 1986.<br>
Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.. 83:9065-9069), transfer of entire chromosomal segments<br>
(Lavitrano et al., 1989, Cell 57:717-723), and gamete transfection in conjunction with in vitro<br>
fertilization (Lavitrano et al., 1989. Cell 57:717-723) have also been used. Several books of<br>
laboratory procedures have been published disclosing these techniques: Cid-Arregui and<br>
Garcia-Carranca (1998, Microinjection and Transgenesis : Strategies and Protocols, Springer.<br>
Berlin). Clarke (2002. Transgenesis Techniques : Principles and Protocols, Humana Press.<br>
Totowa, NJ), and Pinkert (1994. Transgenic Animal Technology : A Laboratory Handbook.<br>
Academic Press. San Diego).<br>
Once the combinant DNA is introduced into, the egg, the egg is incubated for a short<br>
period of time and is then transferred into a pseudopregnant animal of the same species from<br>
which the egg was obtained (Hogan et al., supra). In the case of mammals, typically 125<br>
eggs are injected per experiment, approximately two-thirds of which will survive the<br>
procedure. Twenty viable eggs are transferred into a pseudopregnant mammal, four to ten of<br>
which will develop into live progeny. Typically, 10-30% of the progeny (in the case of mice)<br>
carry the recombinant DNA.<br>
While the entire animal can be used as an expression system for the peptides of the<br>
invention, in a preferred embodiment, the exogenous peptide accumulates in products of the<br>
animal, from which it can be harvested without injury to the animal. In preferred<br>
embodiments, the exogenous peptide accumulates in milk, eggs, hair, blood, and urine.<br>
If the recombinant peptide is to be accumulated in the milk of the animal, suitable<br>
mammals are ruminants, ungulates, domesticated mammals, and dairy animals. Particularly<br>
preferred animals are goats, sheep, camels, cows, pigs, horses, oxen, and llamas. Methods for<br>
generating transgenic cows that accumulate a recombinant peptide in their milk are well<br>
known: see. Newton (1999. .1. Immunol. Methods 231:159-167), Ebert et al. (1991,<br>
Biotechnology 9: 835-838). and U.S. Patent Nos. 6,210,736, 5,849,992, 5,843,705.<br>
5.827,690. 6.222,094. all of which arc incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. The<br>
generation of transgenic mammals that produce a desired recombinant peptide is<br>
commercially available from GTC Biotherapeutics, Framingham, MA.<br>
If the recombinant peptide is to be accumulated in eggs, suitable birds include, but are<br>
not limited to, chickens, geese, and turkeys. Other animals of interest include, but are not<br>
limited to, other species of avians, fish, reptiles and amphibians. The introduction of<br>
recombinant DNA to a chicken by retroviral transformation is well known in the art:<br>
Thoraval et al. (1995, Transgenic Research 4:369-376), Bosselman et al., (1989, Science 243:<br>
533-535), Petropoulos et al. (1992, J. Virol. 66: 3391-3397), U.S. Patent No. 5,162,215.<br>
incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. Successful transformation of chickens with<br>
recombinant DNA also been achieved wherein DNA is introduced into blastodermal cells<br>
and blastodermal cells so transfected are introduced into the embryo: Brazolot et al. (1991.<br>
Mol. Reprod. Dev. 30: 304-312), Eraser, et al. (1993. Int. J. Dev. Biol. 37: 381-385). and<br>
Petitte et al. (1990. Development 108: 185-189). High throughput technology has been<br>
developed to assess whether a transgenic chicken expresses the desired peptide (Harvey et al..<br>
2002. Poult. Sci. 81:202-212. U.S. Patent No. 6,423.488, incorporated by reference herein in<br>
its entirety). Using retroviral transformation of chicken with a recombinant DNA, exogenous<br>
beta-lactamase was accumulated in the egg white of the chicken (Harvey et al.. 2002, Nat.<br>
Biotechnol. 20(4):396-399). The production of chickens producing exogenous peptides in<br>
egg is commercially available from AviGenics, Inc., Athens GA.<br>
G. Bacteria<br>
Recombinantly expressed peptides produced in bacteria are not generally<br>
glycosylated. However, bacteria systems capable of glycosylating peptides are becoming<br>
evident and therefore it is likely that glycosylated recombinant peptides may be produced in<br>
bacteria in the future.<br>
Numerous bacterial expression systems are known in the art. Preferred bacterial<br>
species include, but are not limited to, E.coli. and Bacillus species.<br>
The expression of recombinant peptides in E. coli is well known in the art. Protocols for E.<br>
coli-based expression systems are found in U.S. Appln No. 20020064835, U.S. Patent Nos.<br>
6.245,539, 5,606,031. 5.420,027, 5,151,511, and RE33,653, among others. Methods to<br>
transform bacteria include, but are not limited to, calcium chloride (Cohen et al., 1972, Proc.<br>
Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.. 69:2110-2114; Hanahan, 1983, J. Mol. Biol. 166:557-580; Mandel<br>
and Higa, 1970, J. Mol. Biol. 53:159-162) and electroporation (Shigekawa and Dower. 1988,<br>
Biotechniques 6:742-751), and those described in Sambrook et al., 2001 (supra). For a<br>
review of laboratory protocols on microbial transformation and expression systems, see<br>

Practical Guide, Academic Press, San Diego),<br>
For a general review on the literature for peptide expression in E. coli see Balbas<br>
(2001. Mol. Biotcchnol. 19:251-267). Several companies now offer bacterial strains selected<br>
for the expression of mammalian peptides, such as the Rosetta™ strains of E. coli (Novagen,<br>
inc.. Madison. WI; with enhanced expression of eukaryotic codons not normally used in<br>
bacteria cells, and enhanced disulfide bond formation).<br>
II. Cell engineering<br>
It will be apparent from the present disclosure that the more uniform the starting<br>
material produced by a cell, the more efficient will be the generation in vitro of large<br>
quantities of peptides having desired glycosylation. Thus, the genetic engineering of host<br>
cells to produce uniformly glycosylated peptides as starting material for the in vitro<br>
enzymatic reactions disclosed herein, provides a significant advantage over using a peptide<br>
starting material having a heterogeneous set of glycan structures attached thereto. One<br>
preferred peptide starting material for use in the present invention is a peptide having<br>
primarily glycan molecules which consist solely of an elemental trimannosyl core structure.<br>
Another preferred starting material is Man3GlcNAc4. Following the remodeling process, the<br>
preferred peptides will give rise to the greatest amount of peptides having desired<br>
glycosylation. and thus improved clinical efficacy. However, other glycan starting material is<br>
also suitable for use in the methods described herein, in that for example, high mannose<br>
glycans may be easily reduced, in vitro, to elemental trimannosyl core structures using a<br>
series of mannosidases. As described elsewhere herein, other glycan starting material may<br>
also be used, provided it is possible to cleave off all extraneous sugar moieties so that the<br>
elemental trimannosyl core structure or Man3GlcNAc4 is generated. Thus, the purpose of<br>
using genetically engineered cells for the production of the peptides of the present invention<br>
is to generate peptides having as uniform as possible a glycan structure attached thereto,<br>
wherein the glycan structure can be remodeled in vitro to generate a peptide having desired<br>
glycosylation. This will result in a dramatic reduction in production costs of these peptides.<br>
Since the glycopeptides produced using this methodology will predominantly have the same<br>
N-linked glycan structure, the post-production modification protocol can be standardized and<br>
optimized to produce a greater batch-to-batch consistency of final product. As a result, the<br>
final completed-chain products may be less heterogeneous than those presently available.<br>
The products will have an improved biological half-life and bioactivity as compared to the<br>
products of the prior art. Alternatively, if desired, the invention can be used to introduce<br>
limited and specific heterogeneity, e.g.. by choosing reaction conditions that result in<br>
differential addition of sugar moieties.<br>
Preferably, though not as a rigid requirement, the genetically engineered cell is one<br>
which produces peptides having glycan structures comprised primarily of an elemental<br>
trimannosyl core structure or Man3GlcNAc4. At a minimum, the proportion of these<br>
preferred structures produced by the genetically engineered cell must be enough to yield a<br>
peptide having desired glycosyiation following the remodeling protocol.<br>
In general, any eukaryotic cell type can be modified to become a host cell of the<br>
present invention. First, the glycosyiation pattern of both endogenous and recombinant<br>
glycopeptides produced by the organism are determined in order to identify suitable<br>
additions/deletions of enzymatic activities that result in the production of elemental<br>
trimannosyl core glycopeptides or Man3GlcNAc4 glycopeptides. This will typically entail<br>
deleting activities that use trimannosyl glycopeptides as substrates for a glycosyltransferasc<br>
reaction and inserting enzymatic activities that degrade more complex N-linked glycans to<br>
produce shorter chains. In addition, genetically engineered cells may produce high mannosc<br>
glycans, which may be cleaved by mannosidase to produce desired starting glycan structures.<br>
The mannosidase may be active in vivo in the cell (i.e., the cell may be genetically engineered<br>
to produce them), or they may be used in in vitro post production reactions.<br>
Techniques for genetically modifying host cells to alter the glycosyiation profile of<br>
expressed peptides are well-known. See, e.g., Altmann et al. (1999, Glycoconjugate J. 16:<br>
109-123), Ailoretal. (2000, Glycobiology 10(8): 837-847), Jarvis et al., (In vitrogen<br>
Conference, March. 1999, abstract), Hollisterand Jarvis, (2001. Glycobiology 11(1): 1-9).<br>
and Palacpac et al.. (1999, PNAS USA 96: 4697), Jarvis et al., (1998. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol.<br>
9:528-533), Gerngross (U.S. Patent Publication No. 20020137134), all of which disclose<br>
techniques to "mammalianize" insect or plant cell expression systems by transfecting insect<br>
or plant cells with glycosyltransferase genes.<br>
Techniques also exist to genetically alter the glycosyiation profile of peptides<br>
expressed in E. coli. E. coli has been engineered with various glycosyltransferases from the<br>
bacteria Neisseria meningitidis and Azorhizobium to produce oligosaccharides in vivo (Bettler<br>
et al. 1999. Glycoconj. J. 16:205-212). E. coli which has been genetically engineered to<br>
over-express Neisseria meningitidis ß1,3 N acetyl glucosaminyltransferase IgtA gene will<br>
efficiently glycosylate exogenous lactose (Priem et al., 2002. Giycobiology 12:235-240).<br>
Fungal cells have also been gefletically modified to produce exogenous<br>
glycosyltransferases (Yoshida et al., 1999, Giycobiology, 9(l):53-58; Kalsner et al.. 1995.<br>
Glycoconj. J. 12:360-370; Schwientek and Ernst, 1994. Gene 145(2):299-303: Chiba et al,<br>
1995, Biochem J. 308:405-409).<br>
Thus, in one aspect, the present invention provides a cell that glycosylates a<br>
glycopeptide population such that a proportion of glycopeptides produced thereby have an<br>
elemental trimannosyl core or a Man3GlcNAc4 structure. Preferably, the cell produces a<br>
peptide having a glycan structure comprised solely of an elemental trimannosyl core. At a<br>
minimum, the proportion of peptides having an elemental trimannosyl core or a<br>
Man3GlcNAc4 structure is enough to yield peptides having desired glycosylation following<br>
the remodeling process. The cell has introduced into it one or more heterologous nucleic acid<br>
expression units, each of which may comprise one or more nucleic acid sequences encoding<br>
one or more peptides of interest. The natural form of the glycopeptide of interest may<br>
comprise one or more complex N-linked glycans or may simply be a high man nose glycan.<br>
The cell may be any type of cell and is preferably a eukaryotic cell. The cell may be a<br>
mammalian cell such as human, mouse, rat, rabbit, hamster or other type of mammalian cell.<br>
When the cell is a mammalian cell, the mammalian cell may be derived from or contained<br>
within a non-human transgenic mammal where the cell in the mammal encodes the desired<br>
glycopeptide and a variety of glycosylating and glycosidase enzymes as necessary for the<br>
production of desired glycopeptide molecules. In addition, the cell may be a fungal cell,<br>
preferably, a yeast cell, or the cell may be an insect or a plant cell. Similarly, when the cell is<br>
a plant cell, the plant cell may be derived from or contained within a transgenic plant,<br>
wherein the plant encodes the desired glycopeptide and a variety of glycosylating and<br>
glycosidase enzymes as are necessary for the production of desired glycopeptide molecules.<br>
In some embodiments the host cell may be a eukaryotic cell expressing one or more<br>
heterologous glycosyltransferase enzymes and/or one or more heterologous glycosidase<br>
enzymes, wherein expression of a recombinant glycopeptide in the host cell results in the<br>
production of a recombinant glycopeptide having an elemental trimannosyl core as the<br>
primary glycan structure attached thereto.<br>
In some embodiments the heterologous glycosyltransferase enzyme useful in the cell<br>
may be selected from a group consisting of any known glycosyltransferase enzyme included<br>
for example, in the list of Glycosyltransferase Families available in 1aniguchi et al. (2002.<br>
Handbook of Glycosyltransferases and Related Genes. Springer, New York).<br>
In other embodiments, the heterologous glycosylasc enzyme may be selected from a<br>
group consisting of mannosidase 1, mannosidase 2, mannosidase 3. and other mannosidases,<br>
including, but not limited to, microbial mannosidases. Additional disclosure regarding<br>
enzymes useful in the present invention is provided elsewhere herein.<br>
In yet other embodiments, the host cell may be a eukaryotic cell wherein one or more<br>
endogenous glycosyltransferase enzymes and/or one or more endogenous glycosidase<br>
enzymes have been inactivated such that expression of a recombinant glycopeptide in the<br>
host cell results in the production of a recombinant glycopeptide having an elemental<br>
trimannosyl core as the primary glycan structure attached thereto.<br>
In additional embodiments, the host cell may express heterologous<br>
glycosyltransferase enzymes and/or glycosidase enzymes while at the same time one or more<br>
endogenous glycosyltransferase enzymes and/or glycosidase enzymes are inactivated.<br>
Endogenous glycosyltransferase enzymes and/or glycosidase enzymes may be inactivated<br>
using any technique known to those skilled in the art including, but not limited to, antisensc<br>
techniques and techniques involving insertion of nucleic acids into the genome of the host<br>
cell. In some embodiments, the endogenous enzymes may be selected from a group<br>
consisting of GnT-1. a selection of mannosidases, xylosyltransferase, core al,3<br>
fucosyltransferase, serine/threonine O-mannosyltransferases, and the like.<br>
Alternatively, an expression system that naturally glycosylates peptides such that the<br>
N-linked glycans are predominantly the trimannosyl core type, or the Man3GlcMAc4 type,<br>
can be exploited. An example of a cell type that produces the trimannosyl core is Sf9 cells.<br>
Other such expression systems can be identified by analyzing glycopeptides that are naturally<br>
or recombinantly expressed in cells and selecting those which exhibit the desired<br>
glycosylation characteristics. The invention should be construed to include any and all such<br>
cells for the production of the peptides of the present invention.<br>
V. Purification of glycan remodeled and/or glycoconjugated peptides<br>
If the modified glycoprotein is produced intracellular^ or secreted, as a first step, the<br>
particulate debris, either host cells, lysed fragments, is removed, for example, by<br>
centrifugation or ultrafiltration; optionally, the protein may be concentrated with a<br>
commercially available protein concentration filter, followed by separating the peptide<br>
variant from other impurities by one or more steps selected from immunoaffinity<br>
chromatography, ion-exchange column fractionation (e.g.. on diethylaminoethyl (DFAE) or<br>
matrices containing carboxymethyl or sulfopropyl groups), chromatography on Blue-<br>
Sepharose, CM Blue-Sepharose, MONO-Q, MONO-S, lentil lectin-Sepharosc, WGA-<br>
Sepharose, Con A-Sepharose, Ether Toyopearl, Butyl Toyopearl, Phenyl Toyopearl. or<br>
protein A Sepharose, SDS-PAGE chromatography, silica chromatography,<br>
chromatofocusing. reverse phase HPLC (RP-HPLC), gel filtration using, e.g., Sephadex<br>
molecular sieve or size-exclusion chromatography, chromatography on columns that<br>
selectively bind the peptide, and ethanol, pH or ammonium sulfate precipitation, membrane<br>
filtration and various techniques.<br>
Modified peptides produced in culture are usually isolated by initial extraction from<br>
cells, enzymes, etc.. followed by one or more concentration, salting-out. aqueous ion-<br>
exchange, or size-exclusion chromatography steps. Additionally, the modified glycoprotein<br>
may be purified by affinity chromatography. Then, HPLC may be employed for final<br>
purification steps.<br>
A protease inhibitor, e.g., phenylmethylsulfonyifluoride (PMSF) may be included in<br>
any of the foregoing steps to inhibit proteolysis and antibiotics may be included to prevent<br>
the growth of adventitious contaminants.<br>
Within another embodiment, supernatants from systems which produce the modified<br>
peptide of the invention are first concentrated using a commercially available protein<br>
concentration filter, for example, an Amicon or Millipore Pellicon ultrafiltration unit.<br>
Following the concentration step, the concentrate may be applied to a suitable purification<br>
matrix. For example, a suitable affinity matrix may comprise a ligand for the peptide, a lectin<br>
or antibody molecule bound to a suitable support. Alternatively, an anion-exchange resin<br>
may be employed, for example, a matrix or substrate having pendant DEAF groups. Suitable<br>
matrices include acrylamide. agarose, dextran. cellulose, or other types commonly employed<br>
in protein purification. Alternatively, a cation-exchange step may be employed. Suitable<br>
cation exchangers include various insoluble matrices comprising sulfopropyl or<br>
carboxymethyl groups. Sulfopropyl groups are particularly preferred.<br>
Then, one or more RP-HPLC steps employing hydrophobic RP-HPLC media, e.g..<br>
silica gel having pendant methyl or other aliphatic groups, may be employed to further purify<br>
a peptide variant composition. Some or all of the foregoing purification steps, in various<br>
combinations, can also be employed to provide a homogeneous modified glycoprotein.<br>
The modified peptide of the invention resulting from a large-scale fermentation may<br>
be purified by methods analogous to those disclosed by Urdal et al, J. Chromatog. 296: 171<br>
(1984). This reference describes two sequential, RP-HPLC steps for purification of<br>
recombinant human 1L-2 on a preparative HPLC column. Alternatively, techniques such as<br>
affinity chromatography may be utilized to purify the modified glycoprotein.<br>

modification are known to confer upon the oligonucleotide enhanced resistance to nucleases.<br>
Specific examples of modified oligonucleotides include those which contain<br>
phosphorothioate, phosphotriester, methyl phosphonate, short chain alkyl orcycloalkyl<br>

No: 5.034,506) or polyamide backbone structures (Nielsen et al., 1991, Science 254: 1497)<br>
may also be used.<br>
Chemical modifications of nucleotides may also be used to enhance the efficiency<br>
with which a nucleotide sequence is taken up by a cell or the efficiency with which it is<br>
expressed in a cell. Any and all combinations of modifications of the nucleotide sequences<br>
are contemplated in the present invention.<br>
The present invention should not be construed as being limited solely to the nucleic<br>
and amino acid sequences disclosed herein. As described in more detail elsewhere herein,<br>
once armed with the present invention, it is readily apparent to one skilled in the art that other<br>
nucleic acids encoding the peptides of the present invention can be obtained by following the<br>
procedures described herein (e.g., site-directed mutagenesis, frame shift mutations, and the<br>
like), and procedures that are well-known in the art.<br>
Also included are isolated nucleic acids encoding fragments of peptides, wherein the<br>
peptide fragments retain the desired biological activity of the peptide. In addition, although<br>
exemplary nucleic acids encoding preferred peptides are disclosed herein in relation to<br>
specific SEQ ID NOS. the invention should in no way be construed to be limited to any<br>
specific nucleic acid disclosed herein. Rather, the invention should be construed to include<br>
any and all nucleic acid molecules having a sufficient percent identity with the sequences<br>
disclosed herein such that these nucleic acids also encode a peptide having the desired<br>
biological activity disclosed herein. Also contemplated are isolated nucleic acids that are<br>
shorter than full length nucleic acids, wherein the biological activity of the peptide encoded<br>
thereby is retained. Methods to determine the percent identity between one nucleic acid and<br>
another are disclosed elsewhere herein as are assays for the determination of the biological<br>
activity of any specific preferred peptide.<br>
Also as disclosed elsewhere herein, any other number of procedures may be used for<br>
the generation of derivative, mutant, or variant forms of the peptides of the present invention<br>
using recombinant DNA methodology well known in the art such as, for example, that<br>
described in Sambrook et al. (1989. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring<br>
Harbor Laboratory Press, New York) and Ausubel et al. (1997, Current Protocols in<br>
Molecular Biology, Green &amp; Wiley, New York). Procedures for the introduction of amino<br>
acid changes in a peptide or polypeptide by altering the DNA sequence encoding the peptide<br>
are well known in the art and are also described in Sambrook et al. (1989, supra); Ausubel et al.<br>
(1997, supra).<br>

That is, the invention encompasses a chimeric nucleic acid wherein the nucleic acid sequence<br>
encoding a tag peptide is covalently linked to the nucleic acid encoding a peptide of the<br>
present invention. Such tag peptides are well known in the art and include, for instance,<br>
green fluorescent protein (GFP), myc, myc-pyruvate kinase (myc-PK), Hisf,. maltose binding<br>
protein (MBP). an influenza virus hemagglutinin tag polypeptide, a flag tag polypeptide<br>
(FLAG), and a glutathione-S-transferase (GST) tag polypeptide. However, the invention<br>
should in no way be construed to be limited to the nucleic acids encoding the above-listed tag<br>
peptides. Rather, any nucleic acid sequence encoding a peptide which may function in a<br>
manner substantially similar to these tag peptides should be construed to be included in the<br>
present invention.<br>
The nucleic acid comprising a nucleic acid encoding a tag peptide can be used to<br>
localize a peptide of the present invention within a cell, a tissue, and/or a whole organism<br>
(e.g., a mammalian embryo), detect a peptide of the present invention secreted from a cell,<br>
and to study the role(s) of the peptide in a cell. Further, addition of a tag peptide facilitates<br>
isolation and purification of the "tagged" peptide such that the peptides of the invention can<br>
be produced and purified readily.<br>
The invention includes the following preferred isolated peptides: G-CSF, IFN-alpha,<br>

acids (or, when referring to the nucleotide sequence encoding the same, are altered in one or<br>
more base pairs) such lhal the resulting peptide (or DNA) is not identical to the sequences<br>

isolate smaller than full length forms of any of the peptides useful in the invention, and to<br>
determine, using the assays provided herein, which isolated fragments retain a desired<br>
biological activity and are therefore useful peptides in the invention.<br>
A biological property of a protein of the present invention should be construed to<br>
include, but not be limited to include the ability of the peptide to function in the biological<br>
assay and environments described herein, such as reduction of inflammation, elicitation of an<br>
immune response, blood-clotting, increased hematopoietic output, protease inhibition,<br>
immune system modulation, binding an antigen, growth, alleviation of treatment of a disease,<br>
DNA cleavage, and the like.<br>
A. G-CSF<br>
The present invention encompasses a method for the modification of the glycan<br>
structure on G-CSF. G-CSF is well known in the art as a cytokine produced by activated T-<br>
cells, macrophages, endothelial cells, and stromal fibroblasts. G-CSF primarily acts on the<br>
bone marrow to increase the production of inflammatory leukocytes, and further functions as<br>
an endocrine hormone to initiate the replenishment of neutrophils consumed during<br>
inflammatory functions. G-CSF also has clinical applications in bone marrow replacement<br>
following chemotherapy.<br>
A remodeled G-CSF peptide may be administered to a patient selected from the group<br>
consisting of a non-myeloid cancer patient receiving myelosuppressive chemotherapy, a<br>
patient having Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) receiving induction or consolidation<br>
chemotherapy, a non-myeloid cancer patient receiving a bone marrow transplant, a patient<br>
undergoing peripheral blood progenitor cell collection, a patient having severe chronic<br>
neutropenia, and a patient having persistent neutropenia and also having advanced HIV<br>
infection. Preferably, the patient is a human patient.<br>
While G-CSF has been shown to be an important and useful compound for<br>
therapeutic applications in mammals especially humans, present methods for the production<br>
of G-CSF from recombinant cells results in a product having a relatively short biological lite,<br>
an inaccurate glycosylation pattern that could potentially lead to immunogenicity, loss of<br>
function, and an increased need for both larger and more frequent doses in order to achieve<br>
the same effect, and the like.<br>
G-CSF has been isolated and cloned, the nucleic acid and amino acid sequences of<br>
which are presented as SEQ ID NO:1 and SEQ ID NO:2, respectively (Figure 58A and 58B,<br>
respectively). The present invention encompasses a method for modifying G-CSF.<br>
particularly as it relates to the ability of G-CSF to function as a potent and functional<br>
biological molecule. The skilled artisan, when equipped with the present disclosure and the<br>
teachings herein, will readily understand that the present invention provides compositions and<br>
methods for the modification of G-CSF.<br>
The present invention further encompasses G-CSF variants, as well known in the art.<br>
As an example, but in no way meant to be limiting to the present invention, a G-CSF variant<br>
has been described in U.S. Patent No. 6,166, 183. in which a G-CSF comprising the natural<br>
complement of lysine residues and further linked to one or two polyethylene glycol<br>
molecules is described. Additionally, U.S. Patent Nos. 6,004,548, 5,580,755, 5,582,823, and<br>
5.676,941 describe a G-CSF variant in which one or more of the cysteine residues at position<br>
I 7. 36, 42, 64, and 74 arc replaced by alanine or alternatively serine. U.S. Patent No.<br>
5.416,195 describes a G-CSF molecule in which the cysteine at position 17, the aspartic acid<br>
at position 27, and the serines at positions 65 and 66 are substituted with serine, serine,<br>
proline, and proline, respectively. Other variants are well known in the art. and are described<br>
in, for example, U.S. Patent No. 5,399,345.<br>
The expression and activity of a modified G-CSF molecule of the present invention<br>
can be assayed using methods well known in the art, and as described in, for example, U.S.<br>
Patent No. 4,810.643. As an example, activity can be measured using radio-labeled<br>
thymidine uptake assays. Briefly, human bone marrow from healthy donors is subjected to a<br>
density cut with Ficoll-Hypaque (1.077 g/ml. Pharmacia, Piscataway, NJ) and low densih<br>
cells are suspended in lscove's medium (GIBCO, La Jolla, CA) containing 10% fetal bovine<br>
scrum, glutamine and antibiotics. About 2 X 104 human bone marrow cells are incubated<br>
with either control medium or the G-CSF or the present invention in 96-well flat bottom<br>
plates at about 37º C in 5% CO2 in air for about 2 days. Cultures are then pulsed for about 4<br>
hours with 0.5 µCi/well of 3H-thymidine (New England Nuclear, Boston, Mass.) and uptake<br>
is measured as described in, for example, Ventua, et al.(1983. Blood 61:781). An increase in<br>
3H-thymidine incorporation into human bone marrow cells as compared to bone marrow cells<br>
treated with a control compound is an indication of a active and viable G-CSF compound.<br>
B. IFN alpha., 1FN beta and 1FN omega<br>
The present invention further encompasses a method for the remodeling and<br>
modification of IFN alpha. IFN beta and IFN omega. IFN alpha is part of a family of<br>
approximately twenty peptides of approximately 18kDa in weight. IFN omega is very similar<br>
in structure and function to IFN alpha. IFN omega is useful for treatment of hepatitis C virus<br>
infection when an immune response to IFN alpha is mounted in the host rendering that<br>
treatment ineffective. Antibodies raised against IFN alpha do not cross-react with IFN<br>
omega. Thus, treatment of hepatitis C may continue using IFN omega when IFN alpha<br>
therapy is no longer possible.<br>
IFN alpha, omega, and IFN beta, collectively known as the Type I interferons, bind to<br>
the same cellular receptor and elicit similar responses. Type I IFNs inhibit viral replication,<br>
increase the lytic potential of NK cells, modulate MIIC molecule expression, and inhibit<br>
cellular proliferation, among other things. Type I IFN has been used as a therapy for viral<br>
infections, particularly hepatitis viruses, and as a therapy for multiple sclerosis.<br>
Current compositions of Type I IFN are, as described above, useful compounds for<br>
both the modulation of aberrant immunological responses and as a therapy for a variety of<br>
diseases. However, they are hampered by decreased potency and function, and a limited half-<br>
life in the body as compared to natural cytokines comprising the natural complement of<br>
glycosylation.<br>
A remodeled interferon-alpha peptide may be administered to a patient selected from<br>
the group consisting of a patient having hairy cell leukemia, a patient having malignant<br>
melanoma, a patient having follicular lymphoma, a patient having condylomata acuminata, a<br>
patient having AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma, a patient having Hepatitis C. a patient having<br>
Hepatitis B, a patient having a human papilloma virus infection, a patient having Chronic<br>
Mycloid Leukemia ((ML), a patient having chronic phase Philadelphia chromosome (III)<br>
positive Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia, a patient having non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL),<br>
a patient having lymphoma, a patient having bladder cancer, and a patient having renal<br>
cancer. Preferably, the patient is a human patient.<br>
A remodeled interferon-beta peptide may be administered to a patient selected from<br>
the group consisting of a patient having multiple sclerosis (MS), a patient having Hepatitis B.<br>

having breast cancer., a patient having brain cancer, a patient having colorectal cancer, a<br>
patient having pulmonary fibrosis, and a patient having rheumatoid arthritis. Preferably, the<br>
patient is a human patient.<br>
A remodeled interferon-omega peptide may be administered to a patient selected from<br>
the group consisting of a patient having hairy cell leukemia, a patient having malignant<br>
melanoma, a patient having follicular lymphoma, a patient having condylomata acuminata, a<br>
patient having AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma, a patient having Hepatitis C, a patient having<br>

cancer. Preferably, the patient is a human patient.<br>
The prototype nucleotide and amino acid sequence for IFN alpha is set forth herein as<br>
SEQ ID NO:3 and SEQ ID NO:4, respectively (Figure 59A and 59B, respectively). The<br>
prototype nucleotide and amino acid sequence for IFN omega is set forth herein as SEQ ID<br>
NO:74 and SEQ ID NO:75, respectively (Figures 59C and 59D, respectively). IFN beta<br>
comprises a single gene product of approximately 20 kDa, the nucleic acid and amino acid<br>
sequence of which are presented herein as SEQ ID NO:5 and SEQ ID NO:6 (Figure 60A and<br>
60B, respectively). The present invention is not limited to the nucleotide and amino acid<br>
sequences herein. One of skill in the art will readily appreciate that many variants of IFN<br>
alpha exist both naturally and as engineered derivatives. Similarly. IFN beta has been<br>
modified in attempts to achieve a more beneficial therapeutic profile, Eamples of modified<br>
Type I IFNs are well known in the art (see Table 9), and are described in. for example U.S.<br>
Patent No. 6,323.006, in which cysteine-60 is substituted for tyrosine, U. S. Patent Nos.<br>
4.737.462, 4.588.585. 5.545,723, and 6.127.332 where an IFN beta with a substitution of a<br>
variety of amino acids is described. Additionally, U.S. Patent Nos. 4,966,843, 5,376,567,<br>
5.795.779 describe IFN alpha-61 and IFN-alpha-76. U.S. Patent Nos .4.748,233 and<br>
4,695,543 describe IFN alpha gx-1, whereas U.S. Patent No. 4,975,276 describes IFN alpha-<br>
54. In addition, U.S. Patent Nos. 4,695,623, 4,897,471, 5,661,009, and 5,541,293 all describe<br>
a consensus IFN alpha sequence to represent all variants known at the date of filing. While<br>
this list of Type I IFNs and variants thereof is in no way meant to be exhaustive, one of skill<br>
in the art will readily understand that the present invention encompasses IFN beta and IFN<br>
alpha molecules, derivatives, and variants known or to be discovered in the future.<br>
Methods of expressing IFN in recombinant cells are well known in the art, and is<br>
easily accomplished using techniques described in, for example U.S. Patent No. 4,966.843,<br>
and in Sambrook et al. (2001. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor<br>
Laboratory Press, New York) and Ausubel et al. (1997, Current Protocols in Molecular<br>
Biology. Green &amp; Wiley, New York). Assays to determine the biological activity of a Type I<br>
IFN modified by the present invention will be well known to the skilled artisan. For<br>
example, the assay described in Rubinstein et al., (1981, Journal of Virology 37:755-758) is<br>
commonly used to determine the effect of an Type I IFN by measuring the cytopathic effects<br>
of viral infection, on a population of cells. This method is only one of many known in the art<br>
for assaying the biological function of a Type IFN.<br>
C. Factor VIIa<br>
The present invention further encompasses a method for the remodeling and<br>
modification of Factor VII. The blood coagulation pathway is a complex reaction comprising<br>
many events. An intermediate event in this pathway is Factor VII, a proenzyme that<br>
participates in the extrinsic pathway of blood coagulation by converting (upon its activation<br>
to Factor VIIa) Factor X to Xa in the presence of tissue factor and calcium ions. Factor Xa in<br>
turn then converts prothrombin to thrombin in the presence of Factor Va, calcium ions and<br>
phospholipid. The activation of Factor X to Factor Xa is an event shared by both the intrinsic<br>
and extrinsic blood coagulation pathways, and therefore, Factor VIIa can be used for the<br>
treatment of patients with deficiencies or inhibitors of Factor VIII. There is also evidence to<br>
suggest that Factor VIIa may participate in the intrinsic pathway as well therefore increasing<br>
the prominence and importance of the role of Factor VII in blood coagulation.<br>
Factor VII is a single-chain glycoprotein with a molecular weight of approximately 50<br>
kDa. In this form, the factor circulates in the blood as an inactive zymogen. Activation of<br>
Factor VII to VIIa may be catalyzed by several different plasma proteases, such as Factor<br>
XIIa. Activation of Factor VII results in the formation of a heavy chain and a light chain held<br>
together by at least one disulfide bond. Further, modified Factor VII molecules that cannot<br>
be converted to Factor VIIa have been described, and are useful as anti-coagulation remedies,<br>
such as in the case of blood clots, thrombosis, and the like. Given the importance of Factor<br>
VII in the blood coagulation pathway, and its use as a treatment for both increased and<br>
decreased levels of coagulation, it follows that a molecule that has a longer biological half-<br>
life, increased potency, and in general, a therapeutic profile more similar to wild-type Factor<br>
VII as it is synthesized and secreted in the healthy human would be beneficial and useful as a<br>
treatment for blood coagulation disorders.<br>
A remodeled Factor VII peptide may be administered to a patient selected from the<br>
group consisting of a hemophiliac patient having a bleeding episode, a patient having<br>
Hemophilia A. a patient with Hemophilia B. a patient having Hemophilia A, wherein the<br>
patient also has antibodies to Factor VIII, a patient having Hemophilia B, wherein the patient<br>
also has antibodies to Factor IX, a patient having liver cirrhosis, a cirrhotic patient having an<br>
orthotopic liver transplant, a cirrhotic patient having upper gastrointestinal bleeding, a patient<br>
having a bone marrow transplant, and a patient having a liver resection. Preferably, the<br>
patient is a human patient.<br>
Factor VII has been cloned and sequenced, and the nucleic acid and amino acid<br>
sequences are presented herein as SEQ ID NO:7 and SEQ ID NO:8 (Figure 61A and 61B,<br>
respectively). The present invention should in no way be construed as limited to the Factor<br>
VII nucleic acid and amino acid sequences set forth herein. Variants of Factor VII are<br>
described in. for example, U.S. Patent Nos. 4,784,950 and 5.580,560. in which lysine-38.<br>
lysine-32, arginine—290. arginine-341, isoleucine-42, tyrosine-278, and tyrosine-332 is<br>
replaced by a variety of amino acids. Further, U.S. Patent Nos. 5,861,374. 6,039,944,<br>
5,833.982, 5,788.965, 6.183,743, 5,997,864, and 5,817,788 describe Factor VII variants that<br>
are not cleaved to form Factor VIIa. The skilled artisan will recognize that the blood<br>
coagulation pathway and the role of Factor VII therein are well known, and therefore many<br>
variants, both naturally occurring and engineered, as described above, are included in the<br>
present invention.<br>
Methods for the expression and to determine the activity of Factor VII arc well known<br>
in the art, and are described in, for example, U.S. Patent No. 4,784,950. Briefly, expression<br>
of Factor VII. or variants thereof, can be accomplished in a variety of both prokaryotic and<br>
eukaryotic systems, including E. coli. CHO cells, BHK cells, insect cells using a baculovirus<br>
expression system, all of which are well known in the art.<br>
Assays for ihc activity of a modified Factor VII prepared according to the methods of<br>
the present invention can be accomplished using methods well known in the art. As a non-<br>
limiting example. Quick et al. (Hemorragic Disease and Thrombosis, 2nd ed.. Leat Febiger.<br>
Philadelphia. 1966). describes a one-stage clotting assay useful for determining the biological<br>
activity of a Factor VII molecule prepared according to the methods of the present invention.<br>
P. Factor IX<br>
The present invention further encompasses a method for remodeling and/or modifying<br>
Factor IX. As described above, Factor IX is vital in the blood coagulation cascade. A<br>
deficiency of Factor IX in the body characterizes a type of hemophilia (type B). Treatment of<br>
this disease is usualh limited to intravenous tranfusion of human plasma protein concentrates<br>
of Factor IX. However, in addition to the practical disadvantages of time and expense,<br>
transfusion of blood concentrates involves the risk of transmission of viral hepatitis, acquired<br>
immune deficiency syndrome or thromboembolic diseases to the recipient.<br>
While Factor IX has demonstrated itself as an important and useful compound for<br>
therapeutic applications, present methods for the production of Factor IX from recombinant<br>
cells (U.S. Patent No. 4,770,999) results in a product with a rather short biological life, an<br>
inaccurate glycosylation pattern that could potentially lead to immunogenicity, loss of<br>
function, an increased need for both larger and more frequent doses in order to achieve the<br>
same effect, and the like.<br>
A remodeled Factor IX peptide may be administered to a patient selected from the<br>
group consisting of a hemophiliac patient having a bleeding episode and also having<br>
Hemophilia B, a patient having Hemophilia B, a patient having Hemophilia B and having<br>
antibodies to Factor IX. a patient having liver cirrhosis, a cirrhotic patient having an<br>
orthotopic liver transplant, a cirrhotic patient having upper gastrointestinal bleeding, a patient<br>
having a bone marrow transplant, and a patient having a liver resection. A remodeled Factor<br>
IX peptide may also be administered to control and/or prevent hemorrhagic episodes in a<br>
patient having Hemophilia B, congenital Factor IX deficiency, or Christmas disease. A<br>
remodeled Factor IX peptide may also be administered to a patient to control and/or prevent<br>
hemorrhagic episodes in the patient during surgery. Preferably, the patient is a human<br>
patient.<br>
The nucleic and amino acid sequences of Factor IX is set forth herein as SEQ ID<br>
NO:9 and SEQ ID NO: 10 (Figure 62A and 62B, respectively), flic present invention is in no<br>
way limited to the sequences set forth herein. Factor IX variants are well known in the art, as<br>
described in. for example, U.S. Patent Nos. 4,770.999, 5,521,070 in which a tyrosine is<br>
replaced by an alanine in the first position, U.S. Patent No. 6,037,452, in which Factor XI is<br>
linked to an alkylenc oxide group, and U.S. Patent No. 6,046,380, in which the DNA<br>
encoding Factor IX is modified in at least one splice site. As demonstrated herein, variants of<br>
Factor IX are well known in the art. and the present disclosure encompasses those variants<br>
known or to be developed or discovered in the future.<br>
Methods for determining the activity of a modified Factor IX prepared according to<br>
the methods of the present invention can be carried out using the methods described above, or<br>
additionally, using methods well known in the art, such as a one stage activated partial<br>
thromboplastin time assay as described in. for example. Biggs (1972. Human Blood<br>
Coagulation Haemoslasis and Thrombosis (Ed. 1). Oxford, Blackwell, Scientific, pg. 614).<br>
Briefly, to assay the biological activity of a Factor IX molecule developed according to the<br>
methods of the present invention, the assay can be performed with equal volumes of<br>
activated partial thromboplastin reagent, Factor IX deficient plasma isolated from a patient<br>
with hemophilia B using sterile phlebotomy techniques well known in the art, and normal<br>
pooled plasma as standard, or the sample. In this assay, one unit of activity is defined as that<br>
amount present in one milliliter of normal pooled plasma. Further, an assay for biological<br>
activity based on the ability of Factor IX to reduce the clotting time of plasma from Factor<br>
IX-deficient patients to normal can be performed as described in, for example, Proctor and<br>
Rapaport (1961, Amer. J. Clin. Path. 36: 212).<br>
E. FSH<br>
The present invention further includes a method for remodeling and/or modifying<br>
FSH. Human reproductive function is controlled in part by a family of hetcrodimeric human<br>
glycoprotein hormones which have a common 92 amino acid glycoprotein alpha subunit, but<br>
differ in their hormone-specific beta subunits. The family includes follicle-stimulating<br>
hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), thyrotropin or thyroid-stimulating hormone<br>
(TSH), and human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). Human FSH and LH are used<br>
therapeutically to regulate various aspects of metabolism pertinent to reproduction in the<br>
human female. For example, FSH partially purified from urine is used clinically to stimulate<br>
follicular maturation in anovulatory women with anovulatory syndrome or luteal phase<br>
deficiency. Luteinizing hormone (LH) and FSH are used in combination to stimulate the<br>
development of ovarian follicles for in vitro fertilization. The role of FSH in the reproductive<br>
cycle is sufficiently well-known to permit therapeutic use, but difficulties have been<br>
encountered due. in part, to the heterogeneity and impurity of the preparation from native<br>
sources. This heterogeneity is due to variations in glycosylation pattern.<br>
FSH is a valuable tool in both in vitro fertilization and stimulation of fertilization in<br>
vivo, but as stated above, its clinical efficacy has been hampered by inconsistency in<br>
glycosylation of the protein. It therefore seems apparent that a method for remodeling FSH<br>
will be of great benefit to the reproductive sciences.<br>
A remodeled FSH peptide may be administered to a patient selected from the group<br>
consisting of a patient undergoing intrauterine insemination (IUI), a patient undergoing in<br>
vitro fertilization (IVF). and an infertile patient. A remodeled FSH peptide may also be<br>
administered to induce or increase ovulation in a patient, to stimulate development of an<br>
ovarian follicle in a patient, to induce gametogenic follicle growth in a patient, to stimulate,<br>
induce or increase follicle development and subsequent ovulation in a patient, or to treat<br>
infertility in a patient. Preferably, the patient is a human female patient. A remodeled FSH<br>
peptide may also be administered to a patient having a pituitary deficiency or to a patient<br>
during puberty. Preferably this patient is a human male patient.<br>
FSH has been cloned and sequenced, the nucleic and amino acid sequences of which<br>
are presented herein as SEQ ID NOT 1, SEQ ID NO: 12, respectively (alpha subunit) and<br>
SEQ ID NO: 13 and SEQ ID NO: 14, respectively (beta subunit) (Figure 63A. 63B, 63C and<br>
63D, respectively). The skilled artisan will readily appreciate that the present invention is not<br>
limited to the sequences depicted herein, as variants of FSH are well known in the art. As a<br>
non-limiting example. U.S. Patent No. 5,639,640 describes the beta subunit comprising two<br>
different amino acid sequences and U.S. Patent No. 5,338,835 describes a beta subunit<br>
comprising an additional amino acid sequence of approximately twenty-seven amino acids<br>
derived from the beta subunit of human chorionic gonadotropin. Therefore, the present<br>
invention comprises FSH variants, both natural and engineered by the human hand, all well<br>
known in the art.<br>
Methods to express FSH in cells, both prokaryotic and cukaryotic, are well known in<br>
the art and abundantly described in the literature (U.S. Patent Nos. 4,840,896, 4.923.805.<br>
5.156.957). Further, methods for evaluating the biological activity of a remodeled FSH<br>
molecule of the present invention are well known in the art, and arc described in, for<br>
example, U.S. Patent No. 4,589, 402, in which methods for determining the effect of FSH on<br>
fertility, egg production, and pregnancy rates is described in both non-human primates and<br>
human subjects.<br>
F. EPO<br>
The present invention further comprises a method of remodeling and/or modifying<br>
EPO. EPO is an acidic glycoprotein of approximately 34 kDa and may occur in three natural<br>
forms: alpha, beta, and asialo. The alpha and beta forms differ slightly in carbohydrate<br>
components but have the same potency, biological activity and molecular weight. The asialo<br>
form is an alpha or beta form with the terminal sialic acid removed. EPO is present in very<br>
low concentrations in plasma when the body is in a healthy state wherein tissues receive<br>
sufficient oxygenation from the existing number of erythrocytes. This normal concentration<br>
is enough to stimulate replacement of red blood cells which are lost normally through aging.<br>
The amount of erythropoietin in the circulation is increased under conditions of hypoxia<br>
when oxygen transport by blood cells in the circulation is reduced. Hypoxia may be caused<br>
by loss of large amounts of blood through hemorrhage, destruction of red blood cells by over-<br>
exposure to radiation, reduction in oxygen intake due to high altitudes or prolonged<br>
unconsciousness, or various forms of anemia. Therefore EPO is a useful compound for<br>
replenishing red blood cells after radiation therapy, anemia, and other life-threatening<br>
conditions.<br>
A remodeled EPQ. peptide may be administered to a patient selected from the group<br>
consisting of a patient having anemia, an anemic patient having chronic renal insufficiency,<br>
an anemic patient having end stage renal disease, an anemic patient undergoing dialysis, an<br>
anemic patient having chronic renal failure, an anemic Zidovudine-treated HIV infected<br>
patient, an anemic patient having non-myeloid cancer and undergoing chemotherapy, and an<br>
anemic patient scheduled to undergo non-cardiac, non-vascular surgery. A remodeled EPO<br>
peptide may also be administered to a patient undergoing surgery to reduce the need for an<br>
allogenic blood transfusion. A remodeled EPO peptide may also be administered to a patient<br>
at increased risk for a perioperative blood transfusion with significant anticipated blood loss.<br>
Preferably, the patient is a human patient.<br>
In light of the importance of EPO in aiding in the recovery from a variety of diseases<br>
and disorders, the present invention is useful for the production of EPO with a natural, and<br>
therefore more effective saccharide component. EPO, as it is currently synthesized, lacks the<br>
full glycosylation complement, and must therefore be administered more frequently and in<br>
higher doses due to its short life in the body. The invention also provides for the production<br>
of PEGylated EPO molecules with greatly improved half-life compared with what might be<br>
achieved by maximizing desirable glycoforms.<br>
EPO has been cloned and sequenced, and the nucleotide and amino acid sequences arc<br>
present herein as SEQ ID NO: 15 and SEQ ID NO: 16, respectively (Figure 64A and 64B,<br>
respectively). It will be readily understood by one of skill in the art that the sequences set<br>
forth herein are only an example of the sequences encoding and comprising EPO. As an<br>
example, U.S. Patent No. 6,187,564 describes a fusion protein comprising the amino acid<br>
sequence of two or more EPO peptides, U.S. Patent Nos. 6,048,971 and 5,614,184 describe<br>
mutant EPO molecules having amino acid substitutions at positions 101, 103, 104, and 108.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 5.106.954 describes a truncated EPO molecule, and U.S. Patent No.<br>
5.888.772 describes an EPO analog with substitutions at position 33, 139, and 166.<br>
Therefore, the skilled artisan will realize that the present invention encompasses EPO and<br>
EPO derivatives and variants as are well documented in the literature and art as a whole.<br>
Additionally, methods of expressing EPO in a cell are well known in the art. As<br>
exemplified in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,703.008, 5,688,679, and 6,376.218, among others, EPO can<br>
be expressed in prokaryotic and eukaryotic expression systems. Methods for assaying the<br>
biological activity of EPO are equally well known in the art. As an example, the Krystal<br>
assay (Krystal, 1983. Exp. Hematol. 11:649-660) can be employed to determine the activity<br>
of EPO prepared according to the methods of the present invention. Briefly, the assay<br>
measures the effect of erythropoietin on intact mouse spleen cells. Mice are treated with<br>
phenylhydrazine to stimulate production of erythropoietin-responsive red blood cell<br>
progenitor cells. Alter treatment, the spleens are removed, intact spleen cells are isolated and<br>
incubated with various amounts of wild-type erythropoietin or the erythropoietin proteins<br>
described herein. After an overnight incubation. 3H-thymidinc is added and its incorporation<br>
into cellular DNA is measured. The amount of 3H-thymidine incorporation is indicative of<br>
erythropoietin-stimulated production of red blood cells via interaction of erythropoietin with<br>
its cellular receptor. The concentration of the erythropoietin protein of the present invention,<br>
as well as the concentration of wild-type erythropoietin, is quantified by competitive<br>
radioimmunoassay methods well known in the art. Specific activities are calculated as<br>
international units measured in the Krystal assay divided by micrograms as measured as<br>
immunoprecipitable protein by radioimmunoassay.<br>
Several different mutated EPO's with different glycosylation patterns have been<br>
reported. Many have improved stimulation of reticulocytosis activity without effecting the<br>
half-life of the peptide in the blood stream of the animal. It is contemplated that mutated<br>
FPO peptides can be used in place of the native F.PO peptides in any of the glycan<br>
remodeling, glycoPEGylation and/or glycoconjugation embodiments described herein.<br>
Preferred mutations of FPO are listed in the following table, but not limited to those listed in<br>
the table (see, for example, Chern et al., 1991, Eur. J. Biochem. 202:225-229; Grodberget al.,<br>
1993. Fur. J. Biochem. 218:597-601; Burns et al., 2002, Blood 99:4400-4405; U.S. Patent<br>
No. 5,614.184; GenBank Accession No. AAN76993; O'Connel) et al.. 1992. J. Biol. Chem.<br>
267:25010-25018: Elliott et al., 1984. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 81:2708-2712; Biosscl et al..<br>
1993, J. Biol. Chem. 268:15983-15993). The most preferred mutations of EPO are Arg139<br>
to Ala139. Arg143 to Ala143 and Lys154 to .Ala154. The preferred native FPO from which to<br>
make these mutants is the 165 aa form, which is depicted in Fig. 65; however other native<br>
forms of EPO may also be used. Finally, the mutations described in Table 10 may be<br>
combined with each other and with other mutations to make EPO peptides that are useful in<br>
the present invention.<br>
G. GM-CSF<br>
The present invenlion encompasses a method for the modification of GM-CSF. GM-<br>
CSF is well known in the art as a cytokine produced by activated T-cells. macrophages,<br>
endothelial cells, and stromal fibroblasts. GM-CSF primarily acts on the bone marrow to<br>
increase the production of inflammatory leukocytes, and further functions as an endocrine<br>
hormone to initiate the replenishment of neutrophils consumed during inflammatory<br>
functions. Further GM-CSF is a macrophage-activating factor and promotes the<br>
differentiation of Lagerhans cells into dendritic cells. Like G-CSF, GM-CSF also has clinical<br>
applications in bone marrow replacement following chemotherapy.<br>
While G-CSF has demonstrated itself as an important and useful compound for<br>
therapeutic applications, present methods for the production of G-CSF from recombinant<br>
cells results in a product with a rather short biological life, an inaccurate glycosylation pattern<br>
that could potentially lead to immunogenicity. loss of function, an increased need for both<br>
larger and more frequent doses in order to achieve the same effect, and the like.<br>
A remodeled GM-CSF peptide may be administered to a patient selected from the<br>
group consisting of a patient having Acute Myelogenous Leukemia (AML) or acute non-<br>
lymphocytic leukemia (ANLL), a patient undergoing leukapheresis to collect hematopoietic<br>
progenitor cells from the peripheral blood, a patient undergoing transplantation of autologous<br>
peripheral blood progenitor cells, a non-1 lodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) patient undergoing an<br>
autologous bone marrow transplant, a Hodgkin's disease patient undergoing an autologous<br>
bone marrow transplant, and an acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patient undergoing an<br>
autologous bone marrow transplant. A remodeled GM-CSF peptide may also be<br>
administered to a patient to accelerate myeloid engraftment. to shorten time to neutrophil<br>
recovery following chemotherapy, to mobilize hematopoietic progenitor cells into the<br>
peripheral blood for collection by leukapheresis, or to promote myeloid reconstitution after<br>
autologous or allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT). A remodeled GM-CSF<br>
peptide may also be administered to a patient in which bone marrow transplantation has<br>
failed or in which myeloid engraftment is delayed. Preferably, the patient is a human patient.<br>
GM-CSF has been isolated and cloned, the nucleic acid and amino acid sequences of<br>
which are presented as SEQ ID NO: 17 and SEQ ID NO: 18, respectively (Figure 66A and<br>
66B. respectively). The present invention encompasses a method for modifying GM-CSF.<br>
particularly as it relates to the ability of GM-CSF to function as a potent and functional<br>
biological molecule. The skilled artisan, when equipped with the present disclosure and the<br>
teachings herein, will readily understand that the present invention provides compositions and<br>
methods for the modification of GM-CSF.<br>
The present invention further encompasses GM-CSF variants, as well known in the<br>
art. As an example, but in no way meant to be limiting to the present invention, a GM-CSF<br>
variant has been described in WO 86/06358, where the protein is modified for an alternative<br>
quaternary structure. Further, U.S. Patent No. 6,287,557 describes a GM-CSF nucleic acid<br>
sequence ligated into the genome of a herpesvirus for gene therapy applications.<br>
Additionally, European Patent Publication No. 0288809 (corresponding to PCT Patent<br>
Publication No. WO 87/02060) reports a fusion protein comprising IL-2 and GM-CSF. The<br>
IL-2 sequence can be at either the N- or C-terminal end of the GM-CSF' such that after acid<br>
cleavage of the fusion protein, GM-CSF having either N- or C-terminal sequence<br>
modifications can be generated. Therefore. GM-CSF derivatives, mutants, and variants are<br>
well known in the ad, and are encompassed within the methods of the present invention.<br>
The expression and activity of a modified GM-CSF molecule of the present invention<br>
can be assayed using methods well known in the art, and as described in, for example, U.S.<br>
Patent No. 4,810,643. As an example, activity can be measured using radio-labeled<br>
thymidine uptake assays. Briefly, human bone marrow from healthy donors is subjected to a<br>
density cut with Ficoll-Hypaque (1.077 g/ml. Pharmacia, Piscataway. NJ) and low density<br>
cells are suspended in Iscove's medium (GIBCO, La Jolla, CA) containing 10% fetal bovine<br>
serum, glutamine and antibiotics. About 2 X 104 human bone marrow cells are incubated<br>
with either control medium or the GM-CSF or the present invention in 96-well flat bottom<br>
plates at about 37° C in 5% CO2 in air for about 2 days. Cultures are then pulsed for about 4<br>
hours with 0.5 u.Ci/\vell of 3H-thymidine (New Fngland Nuclear. Boston. Mass.) and uptake<br>
is measured as described in. for example. Ventua, et al.(1983, Blood 61:781). An increase in<br>
JH-thymidine incorporation into human bone marrow cells as compared to bone marrow cells<br>
treated with a control compound is an indication of a active and viable GM-CSF compound.<br>
H. IFN-gamma<br>
It is an object of the present invention to encompass a method of modifying and/or<br>
remodeling IFN-gamma. IFN-gamma, otherwise known as Type II interferon, in contrast to<br>
IFN alpha and IFN beta, is a homodimeric glycoprotein comprising two subunits of about 21 -<br>
24 kDa. The size variation is due to variable glycosylation patterns, usually not replicated<br>
when reproduced recombinantly in various expression systems known in the art. IFN-gamma<br>
is a potent activator of macrophages, increases MHC class I molecule expression, and to a<br>
lesser extent, a MHC class II molecule stimulatory agent. Further, IFN-gamma promotes T-<br>
cell differentiation and isotype switching in B-cells. IFN-gamma is also well documented as<br>
a stimulator of neutrophils, NK cells, and antibody responses leading to phagocyte-mediated<br>
clearance. IFN-gamma has been proposed as a treatment to be used in conjunction with<br>
infection by intracellular pathogens, such as tuberculosis and leishmania, and also as an anti-<br>
proliferative therapeutic, useful in conditions with abnormal cell proliferation as a hallmark,<br>
such as various cancers and other neoplasias.<br>
IFN-gamma has demonstrated potent immunological activity, but due to variations in<br>
glycosylation from systems currently used to express IFN-gamma. the potency, efficacy,<br>
biological half-life, and other important factors of a therapeutic have been variable at best.<br>
The present invention encompasses methods to correct this crucial defect.<br>
A remodeled interferon-gamma peptide may be administered to a patient selected<br>
from the group consisting of a patient having chronic granulomatous disease, a patient having<br>
malignant osteopetrosis, a patient having pulmonary fibrosis, a patient having tuberculosis, a<br>
patient having Cryptococcal meningitis, and a patient having pulmonary Mycobacterium<br>
avium complex (MAC) infection. Preferably, the patient is a human patient.<br>
The nucleotide and amino acid sequences of IFN-gamma are presented herein as SEQ<br>
ID NO: 19 and SEQ ID NO:20, respectively (Figure 67A and 67B, respectively). It will be<br>
readily understood that the sequences set forth herein are in no way limiting to the present<br>
invention. In contrast, variants, derivatives, and mutants of IFN-gamma are well known to<br>
the skilled artisan. As an example. U.S. Patent No. 6,083,724 describes a recombinant avian<br>
IFN-gamma and U.S. Patent No. 5.770,191 describes C-terminus variants of human IFN-<br>
gamma. In addition, U.S. Patent No. 4,758,656 describes novel IFN-gamma derivatives, and<br>
methods of synthesizing them in various expression systems. Therefore, the present<br>
invention is not limited to the sequences of IFN-gamma disclosed elsewhere herein, but<br>
encompasses all derivatives, variants, muteins, and the like well known in the art.<br>
Expression systems for IFN-gamma are equally well known in the art, and include<br>
prokaryotic and eukaryotic systems, as well as plant and insect cell preparations, methods of<br>
which are known to the skilled artisan. As an example, U.S. Patent No. 4,758,656 describes a<br>
system for expressing IFN-gamma derivatives in E. coli, whereas U.S. Patent No. 4.889,803<br>
describes an expression system employing Chinese hamster ovary cells and an SV40<br>
promoter.<br>
Assays for the biological activity of a remodeled IFN-gamma prepared according to<br>
the methods disclosed herein will be well known to one of skill in the art. Biological assays<br>
for IFN-gamma expression can be found in. for example, U.S. Patent No. 5,807,744. Briefly,<br>
IFN-gamma is added to cultures of CD34++CD38-cells (100 cells per well) stimulated by<br>
cytokine combinations to induce proliferation of CD34++CD38- cells, such as IL-3, c-kit<br>
ligand and either IL-1. IL-6 or G-CSF. Cell proliferation, and generation of secondary<br>
colony forming cells will be profoundly inhibited in a dose dependent way, with near<br>
complete inhibition occurring at 5000 U/milliliter of IFN-gamma. As a confirmatory test to<br>
the inhibitory effect of IFN-gamma, addition of IFN-gamma antibodies can be performed as a<br>
control.<br>
I. alpha-Protease inhibitor (q-antitrypsin)<br>
The present invention further includes a method for the remodeling of alpha-protease<br>
inhibitor (A-1 -PI. a-1-antitrypsin or a-1-trypsin inhibitor), also known as alpha-antitrypsin.<br>
A-l-PI is a glycoprotein having molecular weight of 53 kDa. A-l-PI plays a role in<br>
controlling tissue destruction by endogenous serine proteases, and is the most pronounced<br>
serine protease inhibitor in blood plasma. In particular, A-l-PI inhibits various elastases<br>
including neutrophil elastase. Elastase is a protease which breaks down tissues, and can be<br>
particularly problematic when its activity is unregulated in lung tissue. This protease<br>
functions by breaking down foreign proteins. However, when API is not present in sufficient<br>
quantities to regulate elastase activity, the elastase breaks down lung tissue. In time, this<br>
imbalance results in chronic lung tissue damage and emphysema. In fact, a genetic<br>
deficiency of A-l-PI has been shown to be associated with premature development of<br>
pulmonary emphysema. A-l-PI replenishment has been successfully used for treatment of<br>
this form of emphysema. Further, a deficiency of A-1-PI may also contribute to the<br>
aggravation of other diseases such as cystic fibrosis and arthritis, where leukocytes move in<br>
to the lungs or joints to fight infection.<br>
Therefore, A-l-PI could conceivably be used to treat diseases where an imbalance<br>
between inhibitor and protease(s), especially neutrophil elastase, is causing progression of a<br>
disease state. Antiviral activity has also been attributed to A-l-PI. In light of this, it logically<br>
follows that the present invention is useful for the production of A-l-PI that is safe, effective,<br>
and potent in the ever changing atmosphere of the lungs.<br>
A remodeled A-1-PI peptide may be administered to a patient selected from the group<br>
consisting of a patient having congenital alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency and emphysema, a<br>
patient having cystic fibrosis, and a patient having pulmonary fibrosis. Preferably, the patient<br>
is a human patient.<br>
A-1-PI has been cloned and sequenced, and is set forth in SEQ ID NO:21 and SEQ ID<br>
NO:22 (Figure 68A and 68B, respectively). As is understood by one of skill in the art,<br>
natural and engineered variants of A-1-PI exist, and are encompassed in the present<br>
invention. As an example, U.S. Patent No. 5,723,316 describes A-l-PI derivatives having<br>
amino acid substitutions at positions 356-361 and further comprises an N-terminal extension<br>
of approximately three amino acids. U. S. Patent No. 5,674,708 describes A-l-PI analogs<br>
with amino acid substitutions at position 358 in the primary amino acid sequence. The<br>
skilled artisan will readily realize that the present invention encompasses A-l-PI variants,<br>
derivatives, and mutants known or to be discovered.<br>
Methods for the expression and determination of activity of a remodeled A-l-PI<br>
produced according to the methods of the present invention are well known in the art. and are<br>
described in, for example. U.S. Patent No. 5.674,708 and U.S. Patent No. 5.723,316. Briefly,<br>
biological activity can be determined using assays for antichymotrypsin activity by<br>
measuring the inhibition of the chymotrypsin-catalyzed hydrolysis of substrate N-suc-Ala--<br>
Ala-Pro-Phe-p-nitroanilide (0.1 ml of a 10 mM solution in 90% DMSO), as described in,<br>
for example. DelMar et al. (1979, Anal. Biochem. 99: 316). A typical chymotrypsin assay<br>
contains, in 1.0 milliliters: 100 mM Tris-CI buffer, pH 8.3, 0.005% (v/v) Triton X-100,<br>
bovine pancreatic chymotrypsin (18 kmmol) and A-l-PI of the present invention. The assay<br>
mixture is pre-incubated at room temperature for 5 minutes, substrate (0.01 ml of a 10 mM<br>
solution in 90% DMSO) is added and remaining chymotrypsin activity is determined by the<br>
rate of change in absorbance at 410nm caused by the release of p-nitroanilinc. Measurements<br>
of optical absorbance are conducted at 25° C using a spectrophotometer fitted with a<br>
temperature controlled sample compartment.<br>
J. Glucocerebrosidase<br>
The invention described herein further includes a method for the modification of<br>
glucocerebrosidase. Glucocerebrosidase is a lysosomal glycoprotein enzyme which catalyzes<br>
the hydrolysis of the glycolipid glucocerebroside to glucose and ceramide. Variants of<br>
glucocerebrosidase are sold commercially as Cerezyme™ and Ceredase™, and is an<br>
approved therapeutic for the treatment of Gaucher disease. Ceredase™ is a placental derived<br>
form of glucocercbrosidase with complete N-linked structures. Cerezyme™ is a recombinant<br>
variant of glucocerebrosidase which is 497 amino acids in length and is expressed in CI JO<br>
cells. The 4 N-linked glycans of Cerezyme have been modified to terminate in the<br>
trimannose core.<br>
Glucocerebrosidase is presently produced in recombinant mammalian cell cultures,<br>
and therefore reflects the glycosylation patterns of those cells, usually rodent cells such as<br>
Chinese hamster ovary cells or baby hamster kidney cells, which differ drastically from those<br>
of human glycosylation patterns, leading to, among other things, immunogenicity and lack of<br>
potency.<br>
A remodeled glucocerebrosidase peptide may be administered to a patient selected<br>
from the group consisting of a patient having a lysosomal storage disease, a patient having a<br>
glucocerebrosidase deficiency, and a patient having Gaucher disease. Preferably, the patient<br>
is a human patient.<br>
The nucleic acid and amino acid sequences of glucocerebrosidase are set forth herein<br>
as SBQ ID NO:23 and 24 (Figure 69A and 69B, respectively). However, as will be<br>
appreciated by the skilled artisan, the sequences represented herein are prototypical<br>
sequences, and do not limit the invention. In fact, variants of glucocerebrosidase are well<br>
known, and are described in, for example. U.S. Patent 6,015,703 describes enhanced<br>
production of glucocerebrosidase analogs and variants thereof. Further, U.S. Patent No.<br>
6.087.131 describes the cloning and sequencing of yet another glucocerebrosidase variant. It<br>
is the intention of the present invention to encompass these and other derivatives, variants,<br>
and mutants known or to be discovered in the future.<br>
Methods for the expression of glucocerebrosidase are well known in the art using<br>
standard techniques, and are described in detail in, for example, U.S. Patent No. 6.015,703.<br>
Assays for the biological efficacy of a glucocerebrosidase molecule prepared according to the<br>
methods of the present invention are similarly well known in the art. and a mouse Gaucher<br>
disease model for evaluation and use of a glucocerebrosidase therapeutic is described in. for<br>
example. Marshall et al. (2002, Mol. Ther. 6:179).<br>
K. TPA<br>
The present invention further encompasses a method for the remodeling of tissue-type<br>
activator (TPA). TPA activates plasminogen to form plasmin which dissolves fibrin, the<br>
main component of the protein substrate of the thrombus. TPA preparations were developed<br>
as a thrombolytic agents having a very high selectivity toward the thrombus in the<br>
thrombolytic treatment for thrombosis which causes myocardial infarction and cerebral<br>
infarction.<br>
Further, various modified TPA's have been produced by genetic engineering for the<br>
purpose of obtaining higher affinity to fibrin and longer half-life in blood than that of natural<br>
TPA. TPA's are proteins that are generally extremely difficult to solubilize in water. In<br>
particular, the modified TPA's are more difficult to solubilize in water than natural TPA,<br>
making very difficult the preparation of modified TPA's. Modified TPA's are thus difficult to<br>
dissolve in water at the time of the administration to a patient. However, the modified TPA's<br>
have various advantages, such as increased affinity for fibrin and longer half-life in blood. It<br>
is the object of the present invention to increase the solubility of modified TPA's.<br>
A remodeled TPA peptide may be administered to a patient selected from the group<br>
consisting of a patient suffering from an acute myocardial infarction and a patient suffering<br>
from an acute ischemic stroke. A remodeled TPA peptide may also be administered to a<br>
patient to improve ventricular function following an acute myocardial infarction, to reduce<br>
the incidence of congestive heart failure following an acute myocardial infarction, or to<br>
reduce mortality associated with acute myocardial infarction. A remodeled TPA peptide may<br>
also be administered to a patient to improve neurological recovery following an acute<br>
ischemic stroke or to reduce the incidence of disability or paralysis following an acute<br>
ischemic stroke. Preferably, the patient is a human patient.<br>
The nucleic and amino acid sequences of TPA are set forth herein as SEQ ID NO:25<br>
and SEQ ID NO:26, respectively (Figure 70A and 70B, respectively). As described above,<br>
variants of TPA have been constructed and used in therapeutic applications. For example,<br>
U.S. Patent 5.770,425 described TPA variants in which some of all of the fibrin domain has<br>
been deleted. Further, U.S. Patent 5,736,134 describes TPA in which modifications to the<br>
amino acid at position 276 are disclosed. The skilled artisan, when equipped with the present<br>
disclosure and the teachings herein, will readily realize that the present invention comprises<br>
the TPA sequences set forth herein, as well as those variants well known to one versed in the<br>
literature.<br>
The expression of TPA from a nucleic acid sequence encoding the same is well<br>
known in the art. and is described, in detail, in, for example, U.S. Patent No. 5,753.486.<br>
Assays for determining the biological properties of a TPA molecule prepared according to the<br>
methods of the present invention are similarly well known in the art. Briefly, a TPA<br>
molecule synthesized as disclosed elsewhere herein can be assayed for their ability to lysc<br>
fibrin in the presence of saturating concentrations of plasminogen, according to the method of<br>
Carlsen et al. (1988, Anal. Biochem. 168: 428 ). The in vitro clot lysis assay measures the<br>
activity of tissue-type activators by turbidimetry using a microcentrifugal analyzer. A<br>
mixture of thrombin and TPA is centrifuged into a mixture of fibrinogen and plasminogen to<br>
initiate clot formation and subsequent clot dissolution. The resultant profile of absorbance<br>
versus time is analyzed to determine the assay endpoint. Activities of the TPA variants are<br>
compared to a standard curve of TPA. The buffer used throughout the assay is 0.06M sodium<br>
phosphate. pH 7.4 containing 0.01% (v/v) TWEEN 80 and 0.01% (w/v) sodium azide.<br>
1 luman thrombin is at a concentration of about 33 units/ml. Fibrinogen (at 2.0 mg/ml<br>
clottable protein) is chilled on wet ice to precipitate fibronectin and then gravity filtered.<br>
Glu-plasminogen is at a concentration of 1 mg/ml. The analyzer chamber temperature is set<br>
at 37° C. The loader is set to dispense 20 microliters of TPA (about 500 nanograms/milliliter<br>
to about 1.5 micrograms per milliliter) as the sample for the standard curve, or 20 microliters<br>
of variant TPAs at a concentration to cause lysis within the range of the standard curve.<br>
Twenty microliters of thrombin as the secondary reagent, and 200 microliters of a 50:1 (v/v)<br>
fibrinogen: plasminogen mixture as the primary reagent. The absorbance/time program is<br>
used with a 5 min incubation time, 340-nanometer-filter and 90 second interval readings.<br>
L. IL-2<br>
The present invention further encompasses a method for the remodeling and<br>
modification of IL-2. IL-2 is the main growth factor of T lymphocytes and increases the<br>
humoral and cellular immune responses1 by stimulating cytotoxic CDS T ceils and NK cells.<br>
IL-2 is therefore crucial in the defense mechanisms against tumors and viral infections. IL-2<br>
is also used in therapy against metastatic melanoma and renal adenocarcinoma, and has been<br>
used in clinical trials in many forms of cancer. Further, IL-2 has also been used in HIV<br>
infected patients where it leads to a significant increase in CD4 counts.<br>
Given the success IL-2 has demonstrated in the management and treatment of life-<br>
threatening diseases such as various cancers and AIDS, it follows that the methods of the<br>
present invention would be useful for developing an IL-2 molecule that has a longer<br>
biological half-life, increased potency, and in general, a therapeutic profile more similar to<br>
wild-type IL-2 as it is synthesized secreted in the healthy human.<br>
A remodeled IL-2 peptide may be administered to a patient selected from the group<br>
consisting of a patient having metastatic renal cell carcinoma, a patient having metastatic<br>
melanoma, a patient having ovarian cancer, a patient having Acute Myelogenous Leukemia<br>
(AML), a patient having non-Hodgkin"s lymphoma (NHL), a patient infected with HIV, and<br>
a patient infected with Hepatitis C. A remodeled IL-2 peptide may also be useful for<br>
administeration to a patient as a cancer vaccine adjuvant. Preferably, the patient is a human<br>
patient.<br>
IL-2 has been cloned and sequenced, and the nucleic acid and amino acid sequences<br>
are presented herein as SEQ ID NO:27 and SEQ ID NO:28 (Figure 71A and 71B,<br>
respectively). The present invention should in no way be construed as limited to the IL-2<br>
nucleic acid and amino acid sequences set forth herein. Variants of IL-2 are described in, for<br>
example, U.S. Patent No. 6,348,193, in which the asparagine at position 88 is substituted for<br>
arginine, and in U.S. Patent No. 5,206,344, in which a polymer comprising IL-2 variants with<br>
various amino acid substitutions is described. The present invention encompasses these IL-2<br>
variants and others well known in the art.<br>
Methods for the expression and to determine the activity of IL-2 are well known in<br>
the art, and are described in. for example, U.S. Patent No. 5,417,970. Briefly, expression of<br>
IL-2. or variants thereof, can be accomplished in a variety of both prokaryotic and eukaryotic<br>
systems, including E. coli, CHO cells, BHK cells, insect cells using a baculovirus expression<br>
system, all of which are well known in the art.<br>
Assays for the activity of a modified IL-2 prepared according to the methods of the<br>
present invention can proceed as follows. Peripheral blood lymphocytes can be separated<br>
from the erythrocytes and granulocytes by centrifuging on a Ficoll-Hypaque (Pharmacia,<br>
Piscataway. NJ) gradient by the method described in, for example, A. Boyum et al. (Methods<br>
in Enzymology, 1984, Vol. 108, page 88, Academic Press, Inc.). Lymphocytes are<br>
subsequently washed about three times in culture medium consisted of RPMI 1640 (Gibco-<br>
BRL, La Jolla, CA) plus 10% AB human serum (CTS Purpan, Toulouse, France) inactivated<br>
by heat (1 hour at 56" C). 2 mM sodium pyruvate, 5 mM HEPHS, 4 mM L-glutamine. 100<br>
U/ml penicillin. 100 µg/ml streptomycin and 0.25 u,g/ml amphotericin B (complete medium).<br>
Adhesive cells (monocytes and macrophages) arc eliminated by adhesion to plastic and the<br>
remainder of the cells are suspended in complete medium at a concentration of about 5 to 10<br>
X105 cells per milliliter and seeded in culture flasks at a density of about 1-2 X 105 cells per<br>
square centimeter. Flasks are then incubated at 37° C in a 5% C02 atmosphere for about I<br>
hour, after which the non-adhesive lymphocytes are recovered by aspiration after gentle<br>
agitation of the culture flasks.<br>
Non-adhesive lymphocytes are washed once and cultivated at a concentration of about<br>
105 cells per milliliter in complete medium in the presence of the IL-2 of the present<br>
invention for about 48 hours in an incubator as described above. The cells are then washed<br>
once.<br>
The cytotoxic activity of the cells is evaluated after about 4 hours of contact with<br>
target cells of the human T lymphoid line C8166-45/C63 (MT1 cells) resistant to NK cell<br>
cytotoxicity, as described by Salahuddin et al. (1983, Virology 129: 51-64; 1984. Science:<br>
223, 703-707). 6 X 105 HT1 cells are radio-tagged with about 200 ^Ci of 5,Cr (sodium<br>
chromate. Amersham, Arlington Heights. IL) at 37° C for about 1 hour in complete medium<br>
without serum, and then washed several times. The target cells and effective cells are<br>
distributed in round-bottomed microtitration plates with varying ratios of effective cells to<br>
target cells (50:1, 10:1, 1:1). The microtitration plates are centrifuged and, after incubation as<br>
described above, the supernatant from each well is recovered and the radioactivity is<br>
measured using a gamma counter. Cytotoxicity is determined from the quantity of 3 Cr<br>
released by dead target cells. Non-specific cytotoxicity is determined from the amount of<br>
radioactivity spontaneously released from the target cells in the absence of effective cells.<br>
The present method is just one of many well known in the art for measuring the<br>
cytotoxicity of effector cells, and is should not be construed as limiting to the present<br>
invention.<br>
M. Factor VIII<br>
The invention further encompasses a method for the remodeling and modification of Factor<br>
VIII. As described earlier for Factor VII and Factor IX, Factor VIII is a critical component of<br>
the blood coagulation pathway. Human Factor VIII, (antihemophilic factor; FVIII:C) is a<br>
human plasma protein consisting of 2 peptides (light chain molecular weight of 80 kDa and<br>
heavy chain molecular weight variable from 90 to 220 kDa, depending on glycosylation<br>
state). It is an essential cofactor in the coagulation pathway and is required for the<br>
conversion of Factor X into its active form (Factor Xa). Factor VIII circulates in plasma as a<br>
non-covalent complex with von Willibrand Factor (aka FVIII:RP), a dimer of a 2050 aa<br>
peptide (See, U.S. Patent No. 6,307,032). Blood concentrations of Factor VIII below 20% of<br>
normal cause a bleeding disorder designated hemophilia A. Factor VIII blood levels less than<br>
1% result in a severe bleeding disorder, with spontaneous joint bleeding being the most<br>
common symptom.<br>
Similar to other blood coagulation factors, Factor VIII is a therapeutic with a great<br>
deal of potential for the treatment of various bleeding disorders, such as hemophilia A and<br>
hemophilia B. Due to the glycosylation of the heavy chain, current methods for the<br>
preparation of Factor VIII from recombinant cells results in a product that is not as effective<br>
as natural Factor VIII. Purification methods from human plasma result in a crude<br>
composition that is less effective and more difficult to prepare than recombinant Factor VIII.<br>
The current invention seeks to improve this situation.<br>
A remodeled Factor VIII peptide may be administered to a patient selected from the<br>
group consisting of a patient having von Willebrand's disease, a patient having Hemophilia<br>
A. a patient having Factor VIII:C deficiency, a patient having fibrinogen deficiency, a patient<br>
having Factor XIII deficiency, and a patient having acquired Factor VIII inhibitors (acquired<br>
hemophilia). A remodeled Factor VIII peptide may also be administered to a patient to<br>
prevent, treat or control bleeding or hemorrhagic episodes. Preferably, the patient is a human<br>
patient.<br>
The nucleic acid and amino acid sequences of Factor VIII are presented herein as<br>
SEQ ID NO:29 and SEQ ID NO:30, respectively (Figure 72A and 72B, respectively). The<br>
art is rife with variants of Factor VIII, as described in. for example, U.S. Patent No.<br>
5,668,108, in which the aspartic acid at position 1241 is replaced by a glutamic acid with the<br>
accompanying nucleic acid changes as well. U.S. Patent No. 5,149,637 describes a Factor<br>
VIII variants comprising the C-terminal fraction, either glycosylated or unglycosylated. and<br>
U.S. Patent No. 5,661.008 describes a Factor VIII variant comprising amino acids 1 -740<br>
linked to amino acids 1649 to 2332 by at least 3 amino acid residues. Therefore, variants,<br>
derivatives, modifications and complexes of Factor VIII are well known in the art, and are<br>
encompassed in the present invention.<br>
Expression systems for the production of Factor VIII are well known in the art, and<br>
include prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells, as exemplified in U.S. Patent Nos. 5.633,150.<br>
5.804,420. and 5.422.250.<br>
To determine the biological activity of a Factor VIII molecule synthesized according<br>
the methods of the present invention, the skilled artisan will recognize that the assays<br>
described herein for the evaluation of Factor VII and Factor IX are applicable to Factor VIII.<br>
N. Urokinase<br>
The present invention also includes a method for the remodeling and/or modification<br>
of urokinase. Urokinase is a serine protease which activates plasminogen to plasmin. The<br>
protein is synthesized in a variety of tissues including endothelium and kidney, and is<br>
excreted in trace amounts into urine. Purified urokinase exists in two active forms, a high<br>
molecular weight form (HUK; approximately 50 kDa) and a low molecular weight form<br>
(LUK; approximately 30 kDa). LUK has been shown to be derived from IIUK by a<br>
proteolysis after lysine 135, releasing the first 135 amino acids from HUK. Conventional<br>
wisdom has held that 1 IUK or LUK must be converted to proteolylically active forms by the<br>
proteolytic hydrolysis of a single chain precursor, also termed prourokinase. between lysine<br>
158 and isoleucine 159 to generate a two-chain activated form (which continues to<br>
correspond to either HUK or LUK). The proteolytically active urokinase species resulting<br>
from this hydrolytic clip contains two amino acid chains held together by a single disulfide<br>
bond. The two chains formed by the activation clip are termed the A or A1 chains (HUK or<br>
LUK. respectively), and the B chain comprising the protease domain of the molecule.<br>
Urokinase has been shown to be an effective thrombolytic agent. However, since it is<br>
produced naturally in trace quantities the cost of the enzyme is high for an effective dosage.<br>
Urokinase has been produced in recombinant cell culture, and DNA encoding urokinase is<br>
known together with suitable vectors and host microorganisms. Present compositions<br>
comprising urokinase and methods for producing urokinase rccombinantly arc hampered b\ a<br>
product that has deficient glycosylation patterns, and given the complex proteolytic cleavage<br>
events surrounding the activation of urokinase, this aberrant glycosylation leads to a less<br>
effective and less potent product.<br>
A remodeled urokinase peptide may be administered to a patient selected from the<br>
group consisting of a patient having an embolism, a patient having an acute massive<br>
pulmonary embolism, and a patient having coronary artery thrombosis. Preferably, the<br>
patient is a human patient. A remodeled urokinase peptide may also be used to restore<br>
patency to an intravenous catheter, including a central venous catheter obstructed by clotted<br>
blood or fibrin.<br>
The sequence of the nucleotides encoding the primary amino acid chain of urokinase<br>
are depicted in SHQ ID NO:33 and SFQ ID NO:34 (Figure 73A and 73B. respectively).<br>
Variants of urokinase are well known in the art, and therefore the present invention is not<br>
limited to the sequences set forth herein. In fact, the skilled artisan will readily realize that<br>
urokinase variants described in, for example U.S. Patent Nos. 5,219,569, 5,648,253. and<br>
4,892,826, exist as functional moieties, and are therefore encompassed in the present<br>
invention.<br>
The expression and evaluation of a urokinase molecule prepared according to the<br>
methods of the present invention are similarly well known in the art. As a non-limiting<br>
example, the expression of urokinase in various systems is detailed in U.S. Patent No.<br>
5,219,569. An assay for determining the activity and functionality of a urokinase prepared in<br>
accordance to the methods set forth herein are described throughout the literature, and are<br>
similar to assays for other plasminogen and fibrin related assays described elsewhere<br>
throughout. One example of an assay to determine the activity of an urokinase molecule<br>
synthesized as described herein can be as described in, for example, Ploug. et al. (1957.<br>
Biochim. Biophys. Acta 24: 278-282), using fibrin plates comprising 1.25% agarose, 4.1<br>
mg/ml human fibrinogen, 0.3 units/ml of thrombin and 0.5 jug/ml of soybean trypsin<br>
inhibitor.<br>
O. Human DNasc<br>
The present invention further encompasses a method for the remodeling and/or<br>
modification of recombinant human DNase. Human DNase I has been tested as a therapeutic<br>
agent and was shown to diminish the viscosity of cystic fibrosis mucus in vitro. It has been<br>
determined that purulent mucus contains about 10-13 mg/ml of DNA. an ionic polymer<br>
predicted to affect the rheologic properties of airway fluids. Accordingly, bovine pancreatic<br>
DNase I, an enzyme that degrades DNA, was tested as a mucolytic agent many years ago but<br>
did not enter clinical practice, because of side effects induced by antigenicity and/or<br>
contaminating proteases. Recombinant human DNase is currently used as a therapeutic agent<br>
to alleviate the symptoms of diseases such as cystic fibrosis.<br>
A remodeled rDNase peptide may be administered to a patient having cystic fibrosis.<br>
A remodeled rDNase peptide may also be administered to a cystic fibrosis patient to improve<br>
pulmonary function. Preferably, the patient is a human patient.<br>
Similar to DNase derived from bovine sources, recombinant human DNase poses<br>
some problems, mostly due to lowered efficacy due to improper glycosylation imparted by<br>
mammalian expression systems currently in use. The present invention describes a method<br>
for remodeling DNasc, leading to increased efficacy and better therapeutic results.<br>
The nucleotide and amino acid sequences of human DNAse are presented herein as<br>
SEQ ID NO:39 and SEQ ID NO:40 (Figure 74A and 74B, respectively). Variants of the<br>
peptide comprising DNase are well known in the art. As an example, U.S. Patent No.<br>
6,348,343 describes a human DNase with multiple amino acid substitutions throughout the<br>
primary structure. Additionally, U.S. Patent No. 6,391,607 describes a hyperactive variant of<br>
DNase with multiple amino acid substitutions at positions 9, 14, 74, 75, and 205. The present<br>
examples, and others well known in the art or to be discovered in the future are encompassed<br>
in the present invention.<br>
Expression systems for producing a DNase peptide are well known to the skilled<br>
artisan, and have been described in prokaryotic and eukaryotic systems. For example, PCT<br>
Patent Publication No. WO 90/07572 describes these methods in considerable detail.<br>
Assays to determine the biological activity of a DNase molecule developed according<br>
to the methods of the present invention are well known in the art. As an example, but in no<br>
way meant to be limiting to the present invention, an assay to determine the DNA-hydrolytic<br>
activity of"human DNase I is presented herein. Briefly, two different plasmid digestion<br>
assays are used. The first assay ("supcrcoiled DNA digestion assay") measures the<br>
conversion of supcrcoiled double-stranded plasmid DNA to relaxed (nicked), linear, and<br>
degraded forms. The second assay ("linear DNA digestion assay") measured the conversion<br>
of linear double-stranded plasmid DNA to degraded forms. Specifically. DNase prepared<br>
according to the methods of the present invention is added to 160 microliters of a solution<br>
comprising 25 micrograms per milliliter of either supercoiled plasmid DNA or EcoRI-<br>
digested linearized plasmid DNA in 25 mM HEPES. pH 7.1. 100 µg/ml bovine serum<br>
albumin. 1 mM MgCl2. 2.5 mM CaCl2, 150 mM NaCl, and the samples are incubated at room<br>
temperature. At various times, aliquots of the reaction mixtures are removed and quenched<br>
by the addition of 25 mM EDTA, together with xylene cyanol, bromophenol blue, and<br>
glycerol. The integrity of the plasmid DNA in the quenched samples is analyzed by<br>
electrophoresis of the samples on agarose gels. After electrophoresis, the gels are stained<br>
with a solution of ethidium bromide and the DNA in the gels is visualized by ultraviolet light.<br>
The relative amounts of supercoiled, relaxed, and linear forms of plasmid DNA are<br>
determined by scanning the gels with a fluorescent imager (such as the Molecular Dynamics<br>
Model 575 Fluorlmager) and quantitating the amount of DNA in the bands of the gel that<br>
correspond to the different forms.<br>
P. Insulin<br>
The invention further includes a method for remodeling insulin. Insulin is well<br>
known as the most effective treatment for type I diabetes, in which the beta islet cells of the<br>
pancreas do not produce insulin for the regulation of blood glucose levels. The ramifications<br>
of diabetes and uncontrolled blood glucose include circulatory and foot problems, and<br>
blindness, not to mention a variety of other complications that either result from or arc<br>
exacerbated by diabetes.<br>
Prior to the cloning and sequencing of human insulin, porcine insulin was used as a<br>
treatment for diabetes. Insulin is now produced recombinantly, but the short, 51 amino acid<br>
sequence of the mature molecule is a complex structure comprising multiple sulfide bonds.<br>
Current methods to recombinantly produce insulin result in a product that lacks similarity to<br>
the native protein as produced in healthy non-diabetic subjects. The present invention seeks<br>
to repair this flaw.<br>
A remodeled insulin._peptide may be administered to a patient selected from the group<br>
consisting of a patient having Type I Diabetes (diabetes mellitus) and a patient having Type 2<br>
diabetes mellitus who requires basal (long-acting) insulin for the control of hyperglycemia.<br>
A remodeled insulin peptide may also be administered to a diabetic patient to control<br>
hyperglycemia. Preferably, the patient is a human patient.<br>
The nucleotide and amino acid sequence of human insulin is portrayed in SEQ ID<br>
NO:43 and SEQ ID NO:44, respectively (Figure 75A and 75B, respectively). Variants of<br>
insulin are abundant throughout the art. U.S. Patent No. 6,337,194 describes insulin fusion<br>
protein analogs. U.S. Patent No. 6.323.311 describes insulin derivatives comprising a cyclic<br>
anhydride of a dicarboxylic acid, and U.S. Patent No. 6,251,856 describes an insulin<br>
derivative comprising multiple amino acid substitutions and a lipophilic group. The skilled<br>
artisan will recognize that the following examples of insulin derivatives are in no way<br>
exhaustive, but simply represent a small sample of those well known in the art. Therefore,<br>
the present invention comprises insulin derivatives known or to be discovered.<br>
Expression systems for the production of insulin are well known in the art, and can be<br>
accomplished using molecular biology techniques as described in, for example, Sambrook et<br>
al. (1989, Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press,<br>
New York).<br>
Assays to determine the functionality of an insulin molecule prepared according to the<br>
methods of the present invention are similarly well known in the art. For example, an in vivo<br>
model of glucose depression can be used to evaluate the biological activity of insulin<br>
synthesized using the methods of the present invention. Useful for this purpose is a rat<br>
model. The animals are fasted overnight (16 hours) prior to the experiment, and then<br>
anesthetized with intraperitoneal!}' administered sodium pentobarbital or another suitable<br>
anesthetic such as ketamine. Each animal receives an i.v. injection (tail vein) of the particular<br>
insulin derivative (20 u.g/ml/kg). Blood, samples are taken from the jugular vein 15 and 5<br>
minutes before injection and 15, 30, 60, 90, 120, 180, and 240 minutes after injection. Blood<br>
glucose levels are measured with a blood glucose monitor, available from a variety of<br>
commercial suppliers.<br>
Q. Hepatitis B Vaccines (HBsAg)<br>
The present invention further comprises a method for the remodeling the antigen used<br>
in hepatitis B vaccines (HbsAg or Hepatitis B sAg). HBsAg is a recombinantly produced<br>
surface antigen of the hepatitis B S-protein, and is used to illicit an immune response to the<br>
hepatitis B virus, an increasing dangerous virus that results in, among other things, liver<br>
disease including cirrhosis and carcinoma, and results in over 1 million deaths worldwide<br>
annually. Currently the HBsAg vaccine is administered three times over a six month interval<br>
to illicit a protective and neutralizing immune response.<br>
HBsAg is currently produced in yeast strains, and therefore reflects the glycosylation<br>
patterns native to a fungus. The present invention provides a method to remodel HBsAg,<br>
resulting in among other things, improved immunogenicity. antibodies with improved affinity<br>
for the virus, and the like.<br>
A remodeled HBsAg peptide may be administered to a patient to immunize the<br>
patient against disease caused by a Hepatitis B virus. A remodeled HBsAg peptide may also<br>
be administered to a predialysis patient or a dialysis patient to immunize the patient against<br>
disease caused by a Hepatitis B virus. Preferably, the patient is a human patient.<br>
The sequences of the S-protein from a Hepatitis B virus (HBsAg) nucleic acid and<br>
primary amino acid chain are set forth herein as SEQ ID NO:45 and SEQ ID NO:46 (Figure<br>
76A and 76B, respectively). The nucleotide is 1203 bases in length. The amino acid is 400<br>
residues long. The last 226 amino acid residues are the small S-antigen, which is used in the<br>
GlaxoSmithKline vaccine and the Merck vaccine. Fifty-five amino acids upstream from the<br>
small S-antigen is the Pre-S start codon. The Pre-S + S regions are the middle S antigen,<br>
which is used in the Aventis Pasteur vaccine. From the first start codon to the Pre-S start<br>
codon comprises the rest of the S-protein, and is called the large S-protein. This is but one<br>
example of the HBsAg used in vaccines, and other subtypes are well known, as exemplified<br>
in GenBank Ace Nos.: AF415222, AF415221, AF415220, and AF415219. The sequences<br>
presented herein are simply examples of HBsAg known in the art. Similar antigens have<br>
been isolated from other strains of hepatitis B virus, and may or may not have been evaluated<br>
for antigenicity and potential as vaccine candidates. The present invention therefore<br>
encompasses hepatitis B vaccine S-protein surface antigens known or to be discovered.<br>
Kxpression of an HBsAg in an expression system is a routine procedure for one of<br>
skill in the art, and is described in, for example, U.S. Patent No. 5,851,823. Assays for the<br>
immunogenicity of a vaccine are well known in the art, and comprise various tests for the<br>
production of neutralizing antibodies, and employ techniques such as FLISA, neutralization<br>
assays. Western blots, immunoprecipitation, and the like. Briefly, a sandwich ELISA for the<br>
detection of effective anti-HBsAg antibodies is described. The Enzygnost HBsAg assay<br>
(Aventis Behring, King of Prussia, PA) is used for such methods. Wells are coated with anti-<br>
HBs. Serum plasma or purified protein and appropriate controls are added to the wells and<br>
incubated. After washing, peroxidase-labeled antibodies to HBsAg are reacted with the<br>
remaining antigenic determinants. The unbound enzyme-linked antibodies are removed by<br>
washing and the enzyme activity on the solid phase is determined by methods well known in<br>
the art. The enzymatically catalyzed reaction of hydrogen peroxide and chromogen is<br>
stopped by adding diluted sulfuric acid. The color intensity is proportional to the HBsAg<br>
concentration of the sample and is obtained by photometric comparison of the color intensity<br>
of the unknown samples with the color intensities of the accompanying negative and positive<br>
control sera.<br>
R. Human Growth Hormone<br>
The present invention further encompasses a method for the remodeling of human<br>
growth hormone (HGH). The isoform of HGH which-is secreted in the human pituitary,<br>
consists of 191 amino acids and has a molecular weight of about 21,500. The isoform of<br>
HGH which is made in the placenta is a glycosylated form. HGH participates in much of the<br>
regulation of normal human growth and; development, including linear growth<br>
(somatogenesis), lactation, activation of macrophages, and insulin-like and diabetogenic<br>
effects, among others.<br>
HGH is a complex hormone, and its effects are varied as a result of interactions with<br>
various cellular receptors. While compositions comprising HGH have been used in the<br>
clinical setting, especially to treat dwarfism, the efficacy is limited by the absence of<br>
glycosylation of the HGH produced recombinantly.<br>
A remodeled HGH peptide may be administered to a patient selected from the group<br>
consisting of a patient having a growth hormone deficiency, a patient having Turner<br>
syndrome, a patient having growth failure due to a iack of adequate endogenouse growth<br>
hormone secretion, a patient having growth failure due to Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS), a<br>
patient having growth failure associated with chronic renal insufficiency, and a patient having<br>
AIDS associated wasting or cachexia. A remodeled HGH peptide may also be administered<br>
to a patient having short stature. Preferably, the patient is a human patient.<br>
The nucleic and amino acid sequence of HGH are set forth elsewhere herein as SFQ<br>
ID NO:47 and SFQ ID NO:48 (Figure 77A and 77B, respectively). The skilled artisan will<br>
recognize that variants, derivatives, and mutants of HGH are well known. Examples can be<br>
found in U.S. Patent No. 6.143,523 where amino acid residues at positions 10, 14, 18,21,<br>
167. 171. 174. 176 and 179 are substituted, and in U.S. Patent No. 5,962,411 describes splice<br>
variants of HGH. The present invention encompasses these HGH variants known in the art of<br>
to be discovered.<br>
Methods for the expression of HGH in recombinant cells is described in, for example,<br>
U.S. Patent No. 5,795,745. Methods for expression of HGH in, inter alia, prokaryotes,<br>
eukaryotes, insect cell systems, plants, and in vitro translation systems are well known in the<br>
art.<br>
An HGH molecule produced using the methods of the current invention can be<br>
assayed for activity using a variety of methods known to the skilled artisan. For example.<br>
U.S. Patent 5,734.024 describes a method to determine the biological functionality of an<br>
expressed HGH.<br>
S. Anti-Thrombin 111<br>
Antithrombin (antithrombin III. AT-I1H is a Dotent inhibitor of the coagulation<br>
cascade in blood. It is a non-vitamin K-dependent protease that inhibits the action of<br>
thrombin as well as other procoagulant factors (e.g., Factor Xa). Congenital antithrombin III<br>
deficiency is an autosomal dominant disorder in which an individual inherits one copy of a<br>
defective gene. This condition leads to increased risk of venous and arterial thrombosis, with<br>
onset of clinical manifestations typically presenting in young adulthood. Severe congenital<br>
antithrombin III deficiency, in which the individual inherits two defective genes, is an<br>
autosomal recessive condition associated with increased thrombogenesis, typically noted in<br>
infancy. Acquired antithrombin III deficiency most commonly is seen in situations where<br>
there is inappropriate activation of the coagulation system. Common conditions that result in<br>
acquired antithrombin III deficiency include disseminated intravascular coagulation,<br>
microangiopathic hemolytic anemias due to endothelial damage (i.e.. Hemolytic-uremic<br>
syndrome), and vcno-occlusive disease (VOD) seen in patients undergoing bone marrow<br>
transplant. AT-III deficiency may be corrected acutely by infusions of AT-III concentrates.<br>
A remodeled AT-III peptide may be administered to a patient selected from the group<br>
consisting of a patient having a hereditary AT-III deficiency in connection with a surgical or<br>
obstetrical procedure and a hereditary AT-III deficient patient having a thromboembolism.<br>
Preferably, the patient is a human patient.<br>
Antithrombin III (AT-III) is an a2 -glycoprotein of molecular weight 58,000. It is<br>
sold commercially as Thrombate III™ (Bayer Corp., West Haven, CT). The nucleic acid<br>
and amino acid sequences of human antithrombin III are displayed in Figure 78A (SEQ ID<br>
NO:63) and 78B (SEQ ID NO:64), respectively.<br>
Methods to make anti-thrombin III are well know to those in the art. For example,<br>
published nucleic acid and amino acid sequences are available for human antithrombin III<br>
(see, U.S. Patent No. 4,517,294) and mutants of human antithrombin III (see, U.S. Patent<br>
Nos. 5,420.252, 5.618,713, 5.700,663). The methods of the invention may be used with any<br>
of these amino acid sequences and any nucleic acid sequences that encode them, but are not<br>
limited to these sequences. Exemplary methods to produce recombinant antithrombin III are<br>
well known in the art, and several are described in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,420,252, 5.843,705,<br>
6.441,145 and 5.994,628. Exemplary methods to purify recombinant antithrombin III are<br>
described in U.S. Patent Nos. 5.989,593, 6,268,487, 6,395.888, 6.395,881, 6,451,978 and<br>
6.518,406.<br>
There are many known uses for recombinant antithrombin III. Antithrombin III can<br>
be used as a anticoagulant during surgery (U.S. Patent Nos. 5,252,557, 5,182,259), as part of<br>
a pharmaceutical preparation or method to inhibit thrombosis.. (U.S. Patent Nos. 5,565,471.<br>
6,001,820), and to reduce the adverse side effects of cellular transplantation (U.S. Patent No.<br>
6,387,366). Additionally, antithrombin III preparations can be used to increase placental<br>
blood flow (U.S. Patent No. 5,888,964).' inhibit fertilization (U.S. Patent No. 5.545,615), treat<br>
asthma (U.S. Patent No. 6,355,626) and treat arthritis (U.S. Patent No. 5,252,557) and other<br>
inflammatory processes (U.S. Patent No. 6,399,572). Antithrombin III can also be used to<br>
manufacture replacement blood plasma (U.S. Patent Nos. 4,900,720) or prepare a stabilized<br>
cellular blood product (U.S. Patent No. 6,139,878) for transfusions. Antithrombin 111 may be<br>
administered as a pharmaceutical preparation (U.S. Patent Nos. 5,084,273, 5,866,122,<br>
6,399.572, 6.156.731 and 6.514,940) or using gene therapy methodology (U.S. Patent No.<br>
6.410,015). Compositions comprising antithrombin III can be used as tissue adhesives (U.S.<br>
Patent No. 6,500,427) or lubricants for medical devices that are introduced to the patient<br>
(U.S. Patent No. 6,391,832). Antithrombin III can also be used to coat endovascular stents<br>
(U.S. Patent Nos. 6,355.055, 6,240,616, 5.985,307, 5,685,847 and 5.222,971), ocular<br>
implants (U.S. Patent No. 5,944,753) and prostheses in general (U.S. Patent Nos. 6,503.556.<br>
6,491,965 and 6,451.373). Antithrombin III can also be used in methods to locate an internal<br>
bleeding site in a patient (U.S. Patent No. 6,314,314) and to determine hemostatic<br>
dysfunction in a patient (U.S. Patent No. 6,429,017).<br>
T. Human Chorionic Gonadotropin<br>
Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (hCG) is a glycoprotein composed of an alpha<br>
subunit and a beta subunit. HCG is closely related to two other gonadotropins, luteinizing<br>
hormone (LI I) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), as well as thyroid stimulating<br>
hormone (TSH), all three of which are glycoprotein hormones. The alpha subunits of these<br>
various glycoprotein hormones are structurally very similar, but the beta subunits differ in<br>
amino acid sequence.<br>
The nucleic acid and amino acid sequences of the human chorionic gonadotropin oc-<br>
subunit are displayed in Figures 79A (SLQ ID NO:69) and 79B (SEQ ID NO:70),<br>
respectively. The nucleic acid and amino acid sequences of the human chorionic<br>
gonadotropin P-subunit are displayed in Figures 79C (SEQ ID NO:71) and 79D (SEQ ID<br>
NO:72), respectively.<br>
Human chorionic gonadotropin is used in an infertility treatment to promote ovulation<br>
or release of an egg from the ovary in women who do not ovulate on their own. Human<br>
chorionic gonadotropin is also given to young males to treat undescended or underdeveloped<br>
testicles. It is used in men to stimulate the production of testosterone. Some physicians also<br>
prescribe human chorionic gonadotropin for men having erictile dysfunctionor lack of sexual<br>
desire, and for treatment of male "menopause.'"<br>
A remodeled hCG peptide may be administered to a patient selected from the group<br>
consisting of a patient undergoing assisted reproductive technology (ART), a patient<br>
undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF), a patient undergoing embryo transfer, an infertile<br>
patient, a male patient having prepubertal cryptoorchidism not due to anatomical obstruction,<br>
and a male patient having hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. A remodeled hCG peptide may<br>
also be administered to induce final follicular maturation and early luteinization in an infertile<br>
female patient, wherein the infertile female patient has undergone pituitary desensitization<br>
and pretreatment with follicle stimulating hormones. A remodeled hCG peptide may also be<br>
administered to induce ovulation and pregnancy in an anovulatory infertile patient.<br>
Preferably, the patient is a human patient.<br>
Methods to make human chorionic gonadotropin are well known in the art. The<br>
hetcrodimeric hCG can be recombinantly made in any one of many expression systems<br>
currently used for industrial manufacture of recombinant proteins. One method of making<br>
recombinant hCG is described in U.S. Patent No. 5,639,639. Methods for making<br>
recombinant hetcrodimeric proteins by expressing both subunits in the same cell are, in<br>
general, well known in the art. and several methods are described in the U.S. Patent Nos.<br>
5.643,745 (expression in a filamentous fungus), 5,985,611 and 6,087,129 (expression in<br>
secretory cells). Alternatively, each subunit can be expressed individually in cells, and the<br>
two subunits later brought together in vitro for assembly into the heterdimer.<br>
Methods for using human chorionic gonadotropin are numerous and well known in<br>
the art. Commonly, hCG is used to induce or synchronize ovulation in mammals (see, U.S.<br>
Patent Nos. 6,489,288, 5,589,457, 5,532,155, 4,196,123, 4,062,942 and 4,845,077).<br>
Additionally, hCG can be used in pregnancy tests, and in particular agglutination-based tests<br>
(see, U.S. Patent Nos. 3,991,175, 4,003,988, 4,071,314 and 4,088,749). hCG can also be<br>
used in a contraceptive vaccine (see, U.S. Patent Nos. 4,161,519 and 4,966,888). In addition,<br>
hCG can be used to treat conditions related to aging and altered hormonal balance such as<br>
benign prostatic hypertrophy (see, U.S. Patent No. 5,610,136) and central nervous system<br>
diseases common in the elderly (see, U.S. Patent No. 4,791,099).<br>
Alternatively. hCG can be used to detect and treat cancers that express hCG or one of<br>
its subunits. hCG-expressing tumors include, but are not limited to, breast, prostate, ovary<br>
and stomach carcinomas, and neuroblastomas such as Karposi's sarcoma. Antibodies can be<br>
raised to hCG which has been glycoremodeled so as to have glycan structures similar to those<br>
found on the tumor-expressed hCG, and these antibodies may be used to detect hCG-<br>
expressing tumors in patients according to methods well known in the art (see, U.S. Patent<br>
Nos. 4.31 1,688, 4.478,815 and 4.323,546). Additionally, remodeled hCG can be used to<br>
raise an immune response to a tumor that is expressing hCG (see, U.S. Patent Nos. 5.677,275.<br>
5,762,931,5,877,148,4,970,071 and 4,966,753).<br>
hCG can also be used in methods to generally immunomodulate an animal, such as<br>
described in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,554,595, 5,851,997 and 5,700,781. In addition, hCG can be<br>
used as an inhibitor of the matrix metalloprotease in conditions benefiting from such<br>
treatment, such as chronic inflammatory diseases, multiple sclerosis and angiogenesis-<br>
dependent diseases (see, U.S. Patent No. 6,444,639).<br>
U. a-lduronidase<br>
a-Iduronidase is sold commercially as Aldurazyme™ (BioMarin and Genzyme). It is<br>
useful for replacement therapy for the treatment of MPS I, a lysosomal storage disease. MPS<br>
I (also known as Hurler disease) is a genetic disease caused by the deficiency of alpha-L-<br>
iduronidase, an enzyme normally required for the breakdown of certain complex<br>
carbohydrates known as glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). The normal breakdown of GAGs is<br>
incomplete or blocked if the enzyme is not present in sufficient quantity. The cell is then<br>
unable to excrete the carbohydrate residues and they accumulate in the lysosomes of the cell<br>
and cause MPS I.<br>
A remodeled alpha-iduronidase peptide may be administered to a patient selected<br>
from the group consisting of a patient having a lysosomal storage disease, a patient having an<br>
alpha-L-iduronidase deficiency, a patient having mucopolysaccaridosis I (MPS I), and a<br>
patient having Hurler disease. Preferably, the patient is a human patient.<br>
Methods to produce and purify a-iduronidase, as well as methods to treat certain<br>
genetic disorders including a-L-iduronidase deficiency and mucopolysaccharidosis I (MPS 1)<br>
are described in U.S. Patent No. 6,426.208. The nucleic acid and amino acid sequences of<br>
human a-iduronidase are found in Figures 80A (SEQ ID NO:65) and 80B (SEQ ID NO:66),<br>
respectively.<br>
V. a-Galactosidase A<br>
a-Galactosidase A (also known as agalsidase beta) is sold commercially as<br>
Fabrazyme™ (Genzyme). a-Galactosidase A is useful for the treatment of Fabry disease.<br>
Fabry disease is a rare, inherited disorder caused by the deficiency of the essential enzyme oc-<br>
galactosidase. Without this enzyme. Fabry patients are unable to breakdown a fatty acid<br>
substance in their body called globotriasylceramide (GL-3), which accumulates in cells in the<br>
blood vessels of the heart, kidney, brain and other vital organs. The progressive buildup of<br>
this substance puts patients a risk for stroke, heart attack, kidney damage and debilitating<br>
pain. Most patients develop kidney failure during adulthood, and severe organ complications<br>
lead to death around age forty.<br>
A remodeled alpha-galactosidase A peptide may be administered to a patient selected<br>
from the group consisting of a patient having a lysosomal storage disease, a patient having an<br>
alpha-galactosidase A deficiency, and a patient having Fabry disease. Preferably, the patient<br>
is a human patient.<br>
The a-galactosidase A enzyme is a lysosomal enzyme which hydrolyzes<br>
globotriaosylceramide and related glycolipids which have terminal a-galactosidase linkages.<br>
It is a 45 kDa N-glycosylated protein encoded on the long arm of the X chromosome. The<br>
initial glycosylated forms (Mr=55,000 to 58,000) synthesized in human fibroblasts or Chang<br>
liver cells are processed to a mature glycosylated form (Mr=50,000). The mature active<br>
enzyme as purified from human tissues and plasma is a homodimer (Bishop et al.. 1986.<br>
Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 83: 4859-4863). The nucleic acid and amino acid sequences of<br>
a-galactosidase A are found in Figures 81A (SEQ ID NO:67) and 81B (SEQ ID NO:68).<br>
Other useful nucleic acid and amino acid sequences of alpha-galactosidase A are found in<br>
U.S. Patent No. 6,329,191.<br>
References teaching how to make alpha-galactosidase A are found in U.S. Patent Nos.<br>
5.179.023 and 5.658,567 (expression in insect cells), U.S. Patent No. 5,356,804 (expression<br>
and secretion from mammalian cells, including CHO cells), U.S. Patent No. 5.401.451<br>
(expression in mammalian cells). U.S. Patent No. 5.580,757 (expression in mammalian cells<br>
as a fusion protein) and U.S. Patent No. 5,929.304 (expression in plant cells). Methods for<br>
purifying recombinant alpha-galactosidase A are found in U.S. Patent No. 6,395,884.<br>
References teaching how to use alpha-galactosidase A to treat patients include, but are<br>
not limited to, U.S. Patent No. 6,066,626 (gene therapy) and U.S. Patent No. 6,461,609<br>
(treatment with the protein). Mutant forms of alpha-galactosidase A that are useful in the<br>
methods of the invention include, but are not limited to, those described in U.S. Patent No.<br>
6,210,666.<br>
W. Antibodies<br>
The present invention further comprises a method for the remodeling of various<br>
antibody preparations including chimeric antibody preparations, including, chimeric TNFR,<br>
chimeric anti-glycoprotein lib/Ilia, chimeric anti-HER2, chimeric anti-RSV, chimeric anti-<br>
CD20, and chimeric anti-TNF. Chimeric antibody preparations comprise a human Fc portion<br>
from an IgG antibody and the variable regions from a monoclonal antibody specific for an<br>
antigen. Other preparations comprise a receptor, for example the 75 kDa TNF receptor, fused<br>
to a human IgG Fc portion. These molecules further include Fab fragments comprising light<br>
and heavy chains from human and mice. A chimeric TNFR is useful in the treatment of<br>
inflammatory diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis. Chimeric anti-glycoprotein lib/Ilia is<br>
useful in the treatment of cardiac abnormalities, blood clotting, and platelet function<br>
disturbances. A chimeric anti-HER2 is useful as a treatment for breast cancer, chimeric anti-<br>
RSV is useful for the treatment of respiratory syncytial virus, chimeric anti-CD20 is useful<br>
for the treatment of Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and chimeric anti-TNF is used for treatment<br>
of Crohn's disease.<br>
While these chimeric antibodies have proved useful in the management of varied<br>
diseases, administration has to be fairly frequent and at fairly high doses due to the relatively<br>
short half-life of a recombinant protein produced in rodent cells. While a majority of the<br>
chimeric antibody is human, and therefore regarded as "self by the immune system, they are<br>
degraded and destroyed due to non-native glycosylation patterns. The present invention<br>
proposes to repair this problem, greatly increasing the efficacy of these novel medicines.<br>
Antibodies and Methods.of their Generation<br>
The term "antibody." as used herein, refers to an immunoglobulin molecule which is<br>
able to specifically bind to a specific epitope on an antigen. Antibodies can be intact<br>
immunoglobulins derived from natural sources or from recombinant sources and can be<br>
immunoreactive portions of intact immunoglobulins. Antibodies are typically tetramers of<br>
immunoglobulin molecules. The antibodies in the present invention may exist in a variety of<br>
forms including, for example, polyclonal antibodies, monoclonal antibodies, Fv. Fab and<br>
F(ab)2, as well as single chain antibodies and humanized antibodies (Harlow et al., 1999.<br>
Using Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, NY; Harlow<br>
et al., 1989, Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor, New York; Houston et<br>
al., 1988, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 85:5879-5883; Bird et al., 1988, Science 242:423-426).<br>
By the term "synthetic antibody" as used herein, is meant an antibody which is<br>
generated using recombinant DNA technology, such as, for example, an antibody expressed<br>
by a bacteriophage as described herein. The term should also be construed to mean an<br>
antibody which has been generated by the synthesis of a DNA molecule encoding the<br>
antibody and which DNA molecule expresses an antibody peptide, or an amino acid sequence<br>
specifying the antibody, wherein the DNA or amino acid sequence has been obtained using<br>
synthetic DNA or amino acid sequence technology which is available and well known in the<br>
art.<br>
Monoclonal antibodies directed against full length or peptide fragments of a peptide<br>
or peptide may be prepared using any well known monoclonal antibody preparation<br>
procedures, such as those described, for example, in Harlow et al. (1988, In: Antibodies, A<br>
Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor, NY) and in Tuszynski et al. (1988, Blood. 72:109-<br>
115). Quantities of the desired peptide may also be synthesized using chemical synthesis<br>
technology. Alternatively. DNA encoding the desired peptide may be cloned and expressed<br>
from an appropriate promoter sequence in cells suitable for the generation of large quantities<br>
of peptide. Monoclonal antibodies directed against the peptide are generated from mice<br>
immunized with the peptide using standard procedures as referenced herein.<br>
Nucleic acid encoding the monoclonal antibody obtained using the procedures<br>
described herein may be cloned and sequenced using technology which is available in the art.<br>
and is described, for example, in Wright et al. (1992, Critical Rev. in Immunol. 12(3,4): 125-<br>
168) and the references cited therein. Further, the antibody of the invention may be<br>
"humanized" using the technology described in Wright et al., (supra) and in the references<br>
cited therein, and in Gu et al. (1997, Thrombosis and Hematocyst 77(4):755-759).<br>
To generate a phage antibody library, a cDNA library is first obtained from mRNA<br>
which is isolated from cells, e.g., the hybridoma, which express the desired peptide to be<br>
expressed on the phage surface, e.g., the desired antibody. cDNA copies of the mRNA are<br>
produced using reverse transcriptase. cDNA which specifies immunoglobulin fragments are<br>
obtained by PCR and the resulting DNA is cloned into a suitable bacteriophage vector to<br>
generate a bacteriophage DNA library comprising DNA specifying immunoglobulin genes.<br>
The procedures for making a bacteriophage library comprising heterologous DNA are well<br>
known in the art and are described, for example, in Sambrook and Russell (2001, Molecular<br>
Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor, NY).<br>
Bacteriophage which encode the desired antibody, may be engineered such that the<br>
peptide is displayed on the surface thereof in such a manner that it is available for binding to<br>
its corresponding binding peptide, e.g., the antigen against which the antibody is directed.<br>
Thus, when bacteriophage which express a specific antibody are incubated in the presence of<br>
a cell which expresses the corresponding antigen, the bacteriophage will bind to the cell.<br>
Bacteriophage which do not express the antibody will not bind to the cell. Such panning<br>
techniques are well known in the art and are described for example, in Wright et al., (supra).<br>
Processes such as those described above, have been developed for the production of<br>
human antibodies using Ml3 bacteriophage display (Burton et al., 1994, Adv. Immunol.<br>
57:191-280). Essentially, a cDNA library is generated from mRNA obtained from a<br>
population of antibody-producing cells. The mRNA encodes rearranged immunoglobulin<br>
genes and thus, the cDNA encodes the same. Amplified cDNA is cloned into Ml3<br>
expression vectors creating a library of phage which express human antibody fragments on<br>
their surface. Phage which display the antibody of interest are selected by antigen binding<br>
and are propagated in bacteria to produce soluble human immunoglobulin. Thus, in contrast<br>
to conventional monoclonal antibody synthesis, this procedure immortalizes DNA encoding<br>
human immunoglobulin rather than cells which express human immunoglobulin.<br>
Remodeling glycans of antibody molecules<br>
The specific glycosylation ofone class of peptides, namely immunoglobulins, has a<br>
particularly important effect on the biological activity of these peptides. The invention should<br>
not be construed to be limited solely to immunoglobulins of the IgG class, but should also be<br>
construed to include immunoglobulins of the IgA, IgE and IgM classes of antibodies.<br>
Further, the invention should not be construed to be limited solely to any type of<br>
traditional antibody structure. Rather, the invention should be construed to include all types<br>
of antibody molecules, including, for example, fragments of antibodies, chimeric antibodies,<br>
human antibodies, humanized antibodies, etc.<br>
A typical immunoglobulin molecule comprises an effector portion and an antigen<br>
binding portion. For a review of immunoglobulins, see Harlow et al., 1988. Antibodies: A<br>
Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor, New York, and Harlow et al., 1999, Using<br>
Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, NY. The effector<br>
portion of the immunoglobulin molecule resides in the Fc portion of the molecule and is<br>
responsible in part for efficient binding of the immunoglobulin to its cognate cellular<br>
receptor. Improper glycosylation of immunoglobulin molecules particularly in the CH2<br>
domain of the Fc portion of the molecule, affects the biological activity of the<br>
immunoglobulin.<br>
More specifically with respect to the immunoglobulin IgG, IgG effector function is<br>
governed in large part by whether or not the IgG contains an N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc)<br>
residue attached at the 4-0 position of the branched mannose of the trimannosyl core of the<br>
N-glycan at Asparagine (Asn) 297 in the CH2 domain of the IgG molecule. This residue is<br>
known as a "bisecting GlcNAc." The purpose of adding bisecting GlcNAc to the N-glycan<br>
chains of a natural or recombinant IgG molecule or a IgG-Fc-containing chimeric construct is<br>
to optimize Fc immune effector function of the Fc portion of the molecule. Such effector<br>
functions may include antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and any other<br>
biological effects that require efficient binding to FcyR receptors, and binding to the CI<br>
component of complement. The importance of bisecting GlcNAc for achieving maximum<br>
immune effector function of IgG molecules has been described (Lifely et al., 1995.<br>
Glycobiology 5 (8): 813-822: Jeffris et al.. 1990. Biochem. J. 268 (3): 529-537).<br>
The glycans found at the N-glycosylation site at Asn 297 in the CH2 domain of IgG<br>
molecules have been structurally characterized for IgG molecules found circulating in human<br>
and animal blood plasma, IgG produced by myeloma cells, hybridoma cells, and a variety of<br>
transfected immortalized mammalian and insect cell lines. In all cases the N-glycan is cither<br>
a high mannose chain or a complete ( Man3, GlcNAc4, GaI2, NeuAc2, Fuel) or variably<br>
incomplete biantennary chain with or without bisecting GlcNAc (Raju et al., 2000.<br>
Glycobiology 10 (5): 477-486: Jeffris et al., 1998, Immunological. Rev. 163L59-76: Lerouge<br>
et al., 1998, Plant Mol. Biol. 38: 31 -48; James et al.. 1995, Biotechnology 13: 592-596).<br>
The present invention provides an in vitro customized glycosylated immunoglobulin<br>
molecule. The immunoglobulin molecule may be any immunoglobulin molecule, including,<br>
but not limited to, a monoclonal antibody, a synthetic antibody, a chimeric antibody, a<br>
humanized antibody, and the like. Specific methods of generating antibody molecules and<br>
their characterization are disclosed elsewhere herein. Preferably, the immunoglobulin is<br>
IgG. and more preferably, the IgG is a humanized or human IgG, most preferably, IgG I.<br>
The present invention specifically contemplates using |31,4-mannosyl-glycopeptide<br>
(31.4-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase. GnT-III: EC2.4.I.I44 as an in vitro reagent to<br>
glycosidically link N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) onto the 4-0 position of the branched<br>
mannose of the trimannosyl core of the N-glycan at Asn 297 in the CH2 domain of an IgG<br>
molecule. However, as will be appreciated from the disclosure provided herein, the invention<br>
should not be construed to solely include the use of this enzyme to provide a bisecting<br>
GlcNAc to an immunoglobulin molecule. Rather, it has been discovered that it is possible to<br>
modulate the glycosylation pattern of an antibody molecule such that the antibody molecule<br>
has enhanced biological activity, i.e., effector function, in addition to potential enhancement<br>
of other properties, e.g., stability, and the like.<br>
There is provided in the present invention a general method for removing fucose<br>
molecules from the Asn(297) N-linked glycan for the purpose of enhancing binding to Fc-<br>
gammaRIHA, and enhanced antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (see, Shields et al.,<br>
2002, J. Biol. Chem. 277:26733-26740). The method entails contacting the antibody<br>
molecule with a fucosidase appropriate for the linkage of the fucose molecule(s) on the<br>
antibody glycan(s). Alternately, the recombinant antibody can be expressed in cells that do<br>
express fucosytransferases, such as the Lee ] 3 varient of CHO cells. The removal of fucose<br>
from the glycan(s) of the antibody can be done alone, or in conjunction with other methods to<br>
remodel the glycans. such as adding a bisecting GlcNAc. Expression of antibodies in cells<br>
lacking GnT-1 may also result in Fc glycans lacking core fucose, which can be further<br>
modified by the present invention.<br>
There is provided in the present invention a general method for introducing a<br>
bisecting GlcNAc for the purpose of enhancing Fc immune effector function in any<br>
preparation of IgG molecules containing N-linked oligosaccharides in the CH2 domain,<br>
typically at Asn 297. The method requires that the population of IgG molecules is brought to<br>
a state of glycosylation such that the glycan chain is an acceptor for GnT-IIl. This is<br>
accomplished in any one of three ways: 1) by selection or genetic manipulation of a host<br>
expression system that secretes IgG with N-glycan chains that are substrates for GnT-III; 2)<br>
by treatment of a population of IgG glycoforms with exoglycosidases such that the glycan<br>
structure(s) remaining after exoglycosidase treatment is an acceptor for GnT-III; 3) some<br>
combination of host selection and exoglycosidase treatment as in 1) and 2) above plus<br>
successive additions of GlcNAc by GnT-1 and GnT-II to create an acceptor for GnT-III.<br>
For example, IgG obtained from chicken plasma contains primarily high mannose<br>
chains and would require digestion with one or more a-mannosidases to create a substrate for<br>
addition of GlcNAc to the al,3 mannose branch of the trimannosyl core by GnT-I. This<br>
substrate could be the elemental trimannosyl core, Man3GlcNAc2. Treatment of this core<br>
structure with a combination of GnT-I, GnT-II, and GnT-III using UDP-GlcNAc as a sugar<br>
donor creates Man3GlcNAc5 as shown in Figure 1. The order of action of these<br>
glycosyltransferases may be varied to optimize the production of the desired product.<br>
Optionally, this structure can then be extended by treatment with ß1,4 galactosyltransfcrase.<br>
If required, the galactosylated oligosaccharide can be further extended using a2,3- or a2,6-<br>
sialyltransferase to achieve a completed biantennary structure. Using this method<br>
biantennary glycan chains can be remodeled as required for the optimal Fc immune effector<br>
function of any therapeutic IgG under development (Figure 3).<br>
Alternatively. IgG molecules found in the plasma of most animals or IgG which is<br>
secreted as a recombinant product by most animal cells or by transgenic animals typically<br>
include a spectrum of biantennary glycoforms including complete (NeuAc2, Gal2, GlcNAc4.<br>
Man3, ±Fucl) (Figure 3) and variably incomplete forms, with or without bisecting GlcNAe<br>
(Raju et al., 2000, Glycobiology 10 (5): 477-486; Jeffris et al.. 1998, Immunological Rev.<br>
163: 59-76). To ensure that bisecting GlcNAe is present in the entire population of<br>
immunoglobulin molecules so produced, the mixture of molecules can be treated with the<br>
following exoglycosidases, successively or in a mixture: neuraminidase, P-galactosidase, p-<br>
hexosaminidase, a-fucosidase. The resulting trimannosyl core can then be remodeled using<br>
glycosyltransferases as noted above.<br>
In some cases it may be desired to abolish effector function from existing antibody<br>
molecules. The present invention also includes modifying the Fc glycans with appropriate<br>
glycosidases and glycosyltransferases to eliminate effector function. Also anticipated is the<br>
addition of sugars modified with PEG or other polymers that serve to hinder or abolish<br>
binding of Fc receptors or complement to the antibody.<br>
In addition, IgG secreted by transgenic animals or stored as "plantibodies" by<br>
transgenic plants have been characterized. An IgG molecule produced in a transgenic plant<br>
having N-glycans that containß1,2 linked xylose and/or <xl linked fucose can be treated></xl>
with exoglycosidases to remove those residues, in addition to the above described<br>
exoglycosidases in order to create the trimannosyl core or a Man3GlcNAc4 structure, and are<br>
then treated with glycosyltransferases to remodel the N-glycan as described above.<br>
The primary novel aspect of the current invention is the application of appropriate<br>
glycosyltransferases, with or without prior exoglycosidasc treatment, applied in the correct<br>
sequence to optimize the effector function of the antibody. In one exemplary embodiment, a<br>
bisecting GlcNAe is introduced into the glycans of IgG molecules or or other JgG-Fc-<br>
chimeric constructs where bisecting GlcNAe is required. In another exemplary embodiment,<br>
the core fucose is removed from the glycans of IgG molecules or other IgG-Fc-chimeric<br>
constructs.<br>

The skilled artisan will readily appreciate that the sequences set forth herein are not<br>
exhaustive, but are rather examples of the variable regions, receptors, and other binding<br>
moieties of chimeric antibodies. Further, methods to construct chimeric or "humanized"<br>
antibodies are well known in the art, and are described in, for example, U.S. Patent No.<br>
6.329.511 and U.S. Patent No. 6,210.671. Coupled with the present disclosure and methods<br>
well known throughout the art, the skilled artisan will recognize that the present invention is<br>
not limited to the sequences disclosed herein.<br>
The expression of a chimeric antibody is well known in the art, and is described in<br>
detail in, for example, U.S. Patent No. 6,329,511. Expression systems can be prokaryotic,<br>
eukaryotic, and the like. Further, the expression of chimeric antibodies in insect cells using a<br>
baculovirus expression system is described in Putlitz et al. (1990, Bio/Technology 8:651-<br>
654). Additionally, methods of expressing a nucleic acid encoding a fusion or chimeric<br>
protein are well known in the art, and are described in, for example. Sambrook et al. (2001,<br>
Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, New York)<br>
and Ausubel et al. (1997, Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Green &amp; Wiley, New-<br>
York).<br>
Determining the function and biological activity of a chimeric antibody produced<br>
according to the methods of the present invention is a similarly basic operation for one of<br>
skill in the art. Methods for determining the affinity of an antibody by competition assays are<br>
detailed in Berzofsky (J. A. Berzofsky and I. J. Berkower, 1984, in Fundamental<br>
Immunology (ed. W. F. Paul). Raven Press (New York). 595). Briefly, the affinity of the<br>
chimeric antibody is compared to that of the monoclonal antibody from which it was derived<br>
using a radio-iodinated monoclonal antibody.<br>
A remodeled anti-CD20 antibody may be administered to a patient having relapsed or<br>
refractory low grade or follicular, CD20-positive, B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.<br>
Preferably, the patient is a human patient.<br>
VII. Pharmaceutical Compositions<br>
In another aspect, the invention provides a pharmaceutical composition. The<br>
pharmaceutical composition includes a pharmaceutically acceptable diluent and a covalent<br>
conjugate between a non-naturally-occurring, water-soluble polymer, therapeutic moiety or<br>
biomolecule and a glycosylated or non-glycosylated peptide. The polymer, therapeutic<br>
moiety or biomoleculc is conjugated to the peptide via an intact glycosyl linking group<br>
interposed between and covalently linked to both the peptide and the polymer, therapeutic<br>
moiety or biomoleculc.<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions of the invention are suitable for use in a variety of drug<br>
delivery systems. Suitable formulations for use in the present invention are found in<br>
Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences* Mace Publishing Company, Philadelphia, PA, 17th<br>
ed. (1985). For a brief review of methods for drug delivery, see, Langer, Science 249:1527-<br>
1533(1990).<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions may be formulated for any appropriate manner of<br>
administration, including for example, topical, oral, nasal, intravenous, intracranial,<br>
intraperitoneal, subcutaneous or intramuscular administration. For parenteral administration,<br>
such as subcutaneous injection, the carrier preferably comprises water, saline, alcohol, a fat, a<br>
wax or a buffer. For oral administration, any of the above carriers or a solid carrier, such as<br>
mannitol, lactose, starch, magnesium stearate, sodium saccharine, talcum, cellulose, glucose,<br>
sucrose, and magnesium carbonate, may be employed. Biodegradable microspheres {e.g.,<br>
polylactate polyglycolate) may also be employed as carriers for the pharmaceutical<br>
compositions of this invention. Suitable biodegradable microspheres are disclosed, for<br>
example, in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,897,268 and 5,075,109.<br>
Commonly, the pharmaceutical compositions are administered parenterally, e.g.,<br>
intravenously. Thus, the invention provides compositions for parenteral administration which<br>
comprise the compound dissolved or suspended in an acceptable carrier, preferably an<br>
aqueous carrier, e.g., water, buffered water, saline, PBS and the like. The compositions may<br>
contain pharmaceutically acceptable auxiliary substances as required to approximate<br>
physiological conditions, such as pH adjusting and buffering agents, tonicity adjusting agents,<br>
wetting agents, detergents and the like.<br>
These compositions may be sterilized by conventional sterilization techniques, or may<br>
be sterile filtered. The resulting aqueous solutions may be packaged for use as is, or<br>
lyophilized, the lyophilized preparation being combined with a sterile aqueous carrier prior to<br>
administration. The pH of the preparations typically will be between 3 and 11, more<br>
preferably from 5 to 9 and most preferably from 7 and 8.<br>
In some embodiments the peptides of the invention can be incorporated into<br>
liposomes formed from standard vesicle-forming lipids. A variety of methods are available<br>
for preparing liposomes, as described in, e.g., Szoka et al.,Ann. Rev. Biophys. Bioeng. 9: 467<br>
(1980). U.S. Pat. Nos. 4.235,871, 4,501,728 and 4,837,028. The targeting of liposomes using<br>
a variety of targeting agents (e.g., the sialyl galactosides of the invention) is well known in<br>
the art (see. e.g.. U.S. Patent Nos. 4,957.773 and 4.603.044).<br>
Standard methods for coupling targeting agents to liposomes can be used. These<br>
methods generally involve incorporation into liposomes of lipid components, such as<br>
phosphatidylethanolamine, which can be activated for attachment of targeting agents, or<br>
derivatized lipophilic compounds, such as lipid-derivatized peptides of the invention.<br>
Targeting mechanisms generally require that the targeting agents be positioned on the<br>
surface of the liposome in such a manner that the target moieties are available for interaction<br>
with the target, for example, a cell surface receptor. The carbohydrates of the invention may<br>
be attached to a lipid molecule before the liposome is formed using methods known to those<br>
of skill in the art (e.g.. alkylation or acylation of a hydroxyl group present on the<br>
carbohydrate with a long chain alkyl halide or with a fatty acid, respectively). Alternatively,<br>
the liposome may be fashioned in such a way that a connector portion is first incorporated<br>
into the membrane at the time of forming the membrane. The connector portion must have a<br>
lipophilic portion, which is firmly embedded and anchored in the membrane. It must also<br>
have a reactive portion, which is chemically available on the aqueous surface of the liposome.<br>
The reactive portion is selected so that it will be chemically suitable to form a stable chemical<br>
bond with the targeting agent or carbohydrate, which is added later. In some cases it is<br>
possible to attach the target agent to the connector molecule directly, but in most instances it<br>
is more suitable to use a third molecule to act as a chemical bridge, thus linking the connector<br>
molecule which is in the membrane with the target agent or carbohydrate which is extended,<br>
three dimensionally. off of the vesicle surface. The dosage ranges for the administration of<br>
the peptides of the invention are those large enough to produce the desired effect in which the<br>
symptoms of the immune response show some degree of suppression. The dosage should not<br>
be so large as to cause adverse side effects. Generally, the dosage will vary with the age.<br>
condition, sex and extent of the disease in the animal and can be determined by one of skill in<br>
the art. The dosage can be adjusted by the individual physician in the event of any<br>
counterindications.<br>
Additional pharmaceutical methods may be employed to control the duration of<br>
action. Controlled release preparations may be achieved by the use of polymers to conjugate,<br>
complex or adsorb the peptide. The controlled delivery may be exercised by selecting<br>
appropriate macromolecules (for example, polyesters, polyamino carboxymethylcellulose,<br>
and protamine sulfate) and the concentration of macromolecules as well as the methods of<br>
incorporation in order to control release. Another possible method to control the duration of<br>
action by controlled release preparations is to incorporate the peptide into particles of a<br>
polymeric material such as polyesters, polyamino acids, hydrogels, poly (lactic acid) or<br>
ethylene vinylacetate copolymers.<br>
In order to protect peptides from binding with plasma proteins, it is preferred that the<br>
peptides be entrapped in microcapsules prepared, for example, by coacervation techniques or<br>
by interfacial polymerization, for example, hydroxymethylcellulose or gelatin-microcapsules<br>
and poly (methymethacrylate) microcapsules, respectively, or in colloidal drug delivery<br>
systems, for example, liposomes, albumin microspheres, microemulsions. nanoparticlcs. and<br>
nanocapsules or in macroemulsions. Such teachings are disclosed in Remington's<br>
Pharmaceutical Sciences (16th Ed., A. Oslo, ed., Mack, Easton. Pa.. 1980).<br>
The peptides of the invention are well suited for use in targetable drug delivery<br>
systems such as synthetic or natural polymers in the form of macromolecular complexes,<br>
nanocapsules, microspheres, or beads, and lipid-based systems including oil-in-water<br>
emulsions, micelles, mixed micelles, liposomes, and resealed erythrocytes. These systems<br>
are known collectively as colloidal drug delivery systems. Typically, such colloidal particles<br>
containing the dispersed peptides are about 50 nm-2 urn in diameter. The size of the colloidal<br>
particles allows them to be administered intravenously such as by injection, or as an aerosol.<br>
Materials used in the preparation of colloidal systems are typically sterilizable via filter<br>
sterilization, nontoxic, and biodegradable, for example albumin, ethylcellulose, casein,<br>
gelatin, lecithin, phospholipids, and soybean oil. Polymeric colloidal systems are prepared by<br>
a process similar to the coacervation of microencapsulation.<br>
In an exemplary embodiment, the peptides are components of a liposome, used as a<br>
targeted delivery system. When phospholipids are gently dispersed in aqueous media, they<br>
swell, hydrate, and spontaneously form multilamellar concentric bilayer vesicles with layers<br>
of aqueous media separating the lipid bilayer. Such systems are usually referred to as<br>
multilamellar liposomes or multilamellar vesicles (MLVs) and have diameters ranging from<br>
about 100 nm to about 4 um. When MLVs are sonicated, small unilamellar vesicles (SUVS)<br>
with diameters in the range of from about 20 to about 50 nm are formed, which contain an<br>
aqueous solution in the core of the SUV.<br>
Examples of lipids useful in liposome production include phosphatidyl compounds,<br>
such as phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylserine, and<br>
phosphatidylethanolamine. Particularly useful are diacylphosphatidylglycerols. where the<br>
lipid moiety contains from 14-18 carbon atoms, particularly from 16-18 carbon atoms, and<br>
are saturated. Illustrative phospholipids.include egg phosphatidylcholine,<br>
dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine, and distearoylphosphatidylcholine.<br>
In preparing liposomes containing the peptides of the invention, such variables as the<br>
efficiency of peptide encapsulation, lability of the peptide, homogeneity and size of the<br>
resulting population of liposomes, peptide-to-lipid ratio, permeability instability of the<br>
preparation, and pharmaceutical acceptability of the formulation should be considered.<br>
Szoka, et al. Annual Review of Biophysics and Bioengineering, 9: 467 (1980); Deamer, et al.,<br>
in Liposomes, Marcel Dekker, New York, 1983, 27: Hope, et al., Chem. Phys. Lipids, 40: 89<br>
(1986)).<br>
The targeted delivery system containing the peptides of the invention may be<br>
administered in a variety of ways to a host, particularly a mammalian host, such as<br>
intravenously, intramuscularly, subcutaneously, intra-peritoneally, intravascularly. topically,<br>
intracavitarily. transdermally. intranasally, and by inhalation. The concentration of the<br>
peptides will vary upon the particular application, the nature of the disease, the frequency of<br>
administration, or the like. The targeted delivery system-encapsulated peptide may be<br>
provided in a formulation comprising other compounds as appropriate and an aqueous<br>
physiologically acceptable medium, for example, saline, phosphate buffered saline, or the<br>
like.<br>
The compounds prepared by the methods of the invention may also find use as<br>
diagnostic reagents. For example, labeled compounds can be used to locate areas of<br>
inflammation or tumor metastasis in a patient suspected of having an inflammation. For this<br>
use. the compounds can be labeled with 125I, 14C, or tritium.<br>

4. Preparation of UDP-GlcNAc-PEG<br>
This example sets forth the general procedure for making UDP-GlcNAc-PEG. On<br>
the left side of scheme 17, the protected amino sugar diphospho-nucleotide is oxidized to<br>
form an aldehyde at the 6-position of the sugar. The aldehyde is converted to the<br>
corresponding primary amine by formation and reduction of the Schiff base. The resulting<br>
adduct is contacted with the p-nitrophenol carbonate of m-PEG, which reacts with the amine,<br>
binding the m-PEG to the saccharide nucleus via an amide bond. On the right side of scheme<br>
17 at the top. the protected amino sugar diphospho-nucleotide is treated with a chemical<br>
oxidant to form a carboxyl group at the 6-carbon of the sugar nucleus. The carboxyl group is<br>
activated and reacted with m-PEG amine, binding the m-PEG to the saccharide nucleus via<br>
an amide bond. On the right side of scheme 17 at the bottom the reactions are substantially<br>
similar to that on the top right, with the exception that the starting sugar nucleotide is<br>
contacted with an oxidizing enzyme, such as a dehydrogenase, rather than a chemical<br>
oxidant.<br>
5. Preparation of UDP-GalNAc-PEG<br>
This example (scheme 18) sets forth the general procedure for making UDP-GalNAc-<br>
PEG. The reaction set forth above originates with a sugar diphospho-nucleotide. in which R<br>
is either a hydroxyl 1 or a protected amine 2. In step a, the starting sugar is treated with a<br>
mixture of an oxidase and a catalasc, converting the 6-postion of the sugar into an aldehyde<br>
moiety (3 and 4). In step c, the aldehyde is converted to the corresponding amine (7 and 8)<br>
by formation and reduction of a Schiffbase. In step e, the amine is optionally treated with an<br>
activated m-PEG derivative, thereby acylating the amine to produce the corresponding m-<br>
PEG amide (11 and 13). Alternatively, in step f, the amine is contacted with an activated m-<br>
PEG species, such as a m-PEG active ester, thereby forming the corresponding m-PEG amide<br>
(12 and 14). In step b. the starting material is also treated with a catalase and oxidase,<br>
completely oxidizing the hydroxymcthyl moiety, forming a carboxyl group at the 6-position.<br>
In step d, the carboxyl moiety is activated and subsequently converted to a m-PEG adduct (9<br>
and 10) by reaction with a m-PEG amine intermediate. This is shown in scheme 18.<br>
The aminu-sugar phosphate is contacted with a m-PEG N-hydroxy succinimide active<br>
ester, thereby forming the corresponding sugar-PBG-amide. The amide is contacted with<br>
UMP-morpholidate to form the corresponding active sugar diphospho-nucleotide.<br>

Antitrypsin<br>
This example sets forth the preparation of sialylated forms of several recombinant<br>
peptides.<br>
Sialylatiun of Recombinant Glycoproteins Using ST3Gal III. Several<br>
glycoproteins were examined for their ability to be sialylated by recombinant rat ST3Gal III.<br>
for each of these glycoproteins, sialylation will be a valuable process step in the development<br>
of the respective glycoproteins as commercial products.<br>
Reaction Conditions. Reaction conditions were as summarized in Table 11. The<br>
sialyltransferase reactions were carried out for 24 hour at a temperature between room<br>
temperature and 37°. The extent of sialylation was established by determining the amount of<br>
l4C-NeuAc incorporated into glycoprotein-1 inked oligosaccharides. See Table 1 1 for the<br>
reaction conditions for each protein.<br><br>
The results presented in Table 12 demonstrate that a remarkable extent of sialylation<br>
was achieved in every case, despite low levels of enzyme used. Essentially, complete<br>
sialylation was obtained, based on the estimate of available terminal galactose, fable 12<br>
shows the relults of the sialylation reactions. The amount of enzyme used per mg of protein<br>
(mU/mg) as a basis of comparison for the various studies. In several of the examples shown,<br>
only 7-13 ml) ST3Gal III per mg of protein was required to give essentially complete<br>
sialylation after 24 hours.<br>
These results are in marked contrast to those reported in detailed studies with bovine<br>
ST6Gal I where less than 50 mU/mg protein gave less than 50% sialylation, and 1070 mU/mg<br>
protein gave approximately 85-90% sialylation in 24 hours. Paulson et al. (1977) .1. Biol.<br>
Chem. 252: 2363-2371; Paulson et al. (1978) J. Biol. Chem. 253: 5617-5624. A study of rat<br>
a2,3 and a2,6 sialyhransferases by another group revealed that complete sialylation of asialo-<br>
AGP required enzyme concentrations of 150-250 mU/mg protein (Weinstein et al. (1982) J.<br>
Biol. Chem. 257: 13845-13853). These earlier studies taken together suggested that the<br>
ST6Gal I sialyltransferase requires greater than 50 mU/mg and up to 150 mU/mg to achieve<br>
complete sialylation.<br>
This Example demonstrates that sialylation of recombinant glycoproteins using the<br>
ST3 Gal 111 sialyltransferase required much less enzyme than expected. For a one kilogram<br>
scale reaction, approximately 7,000 units of the ST3GaI III sialyltransferase would be<br>
needed, instead of 100,000-150,000 units that earlier studies indicated. Purification of these<br>
enzymes from natural sources is prohibitive, with yields of only 1-10 units for a large scale<br>
preparation after 1-2 months work. Assuming that both the ST6Gal I and ST3Gal III<br>
sialyltransferases are produced as recombinant sialyhransferases, with equal levels of<br>
expression of the two enzymes being achieved, a fermentation scale 14-21 times greater (or<br>
more) would be required for the ST6Gal 1 sialyltransferase relative to the ST3Gal III<br>
sialyltransferase. ['or the ST6Gal I sialyltransferase, expression levels of 0.3 U/I in yeast has<br>
been reported (Borsig et al. (1995) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 210: 14-20).<br>
Expression levels of 1000 U/liter of the ST3 Gal III sialyltransferase have been achieved in<br>
Aspergillus niger. At current levels of expression 300-450,000 liters of yeast fermentation<br>
would be required to produce sufficient enzyme for sialylation of 1 kg of glycoprotein using<br>
the ST6Gal 1 sialyltransferase. In contrast, less than 10 liter fermentation of Aspergillus niger<br>
would be required for sialylation of I kg of glycoprotein using the ST3Gal III<br>
sialyltransferase. Thus, the fermentation capacity required to produce the ST3Gal 111<br>
sialyltransferase for a large scale sialylation reaction would be 10-100 fold less than that<br>
required for producing the ST6Gal I; the cost of producing the sialyltransferase would be<br>
reduced proportionately.<br>

8.Glyco-Remodeling of Cri-IgGl Antibodies<br>
This example sets forth the procedures for in vitro remodeling of Cri-IgGl antibodies.<br>
N-glycosylation at one conserved site at Asn 297 in the Fc domain of a monoclonal<br>
antibody can modulate its pharmacokinetic behavior and effector functions (Dwek et al.,<br>
1995, J. Anat. 187:279-292; Boyd et al.. 1995, Mol. Immunol. 32:1311-1318; Lund et al.,<br>
1995. FASEBJ. 1995. 9:115-119; Lund et al., 1996. J. Immunol. 157:4963-4969; Wright &amp;<br>
Morrison. 1998, J. Immunol. 160:3393-3402; Flynn &amp; Byrd, 2000, Curr. Opin. Oncol.<br>
12:574-581). During cell culture fermentation or in certain pathological conditions,<br>
significant heterogeneity arises in the glycosylation pattern at this site. The resulting<br>
different patterns of glycosylation on the Fc domain are characterized by complex<br>
biantennary structures with zero, one, and two terminal galactose residues (GO, Gl, and G2.<br>
respectively, see Table 13). The observed glycoform variations, such as the variation in<br>
terminal galactosylation, truncated N-glycoforms and bisecting modification, have been<br>
shown to influence the antibody's therapeutic properties, especially its ability to mediate<br>
targeted cell killing through complement binding and activation (Boyd et al., 1995, supra:<br>
Wright &amp; Morrison, 1998, supra. Mimura et al., 2000, Molec. Immunol. 37:697-706: Davies<br>
et al., 2001, Biotechnol. Bioeng. 74:288-294).<br>
In order to obtain different glycoforms of Cri-IgGl antibodies and test their l'c<br>
effector functions. Cri-IgGl antibodies were trimmed back stepwise using exoglycosidases to<br>
generate glycoforms lacking sialic acid (G2, Gl), glycoforms lacking sialic acid and<br>
galactose (GO), and glycoforms lacking sialic acid, galactose and N-acetyl glucosamine<br>
(M3N2F), as illustrated in Table 13. These molecules were subsequently modified using<br>
different glycosyltransferases and appropriate sugars. Modification conditions were<br>
developed that resulted in the conversion of the original antibody glycan structures into<br>
different glycoforms: M3N2, GnT-I-M3N2 (the M3M2 glycoform with a GlcNAc moiety<br>
added using GnT-I), GO, Bisecting-GO (the GO moiety with a bisecting GlcNAc added with<br>
GnT-lII), galactosylatcd bisecting-GO (the bisecting-GO glycoform with terminal galactose<br>
moieties added), G2, mono-sialylated Sl(a2,6)-G2 (the G2 glycoform with one terminal<br>
sialic acid moiety added using a2,6-sialyltransferase), Sl(a2,3)-G2 (the G2 glycoform with<br>
one terminal sialic acid moiety added using a2,3-sialyltransferase) and disialylated S2(a2,3)-<br>
G2 (the G2 glycoform). After every glycoremodeling step, the glycan structures were<br>
enzymatically released from the antibody protein and were analyzed by various methods,<br>
including separation by capillary electrophoresis, 2-AA HPLC profiling and MALDI-TOF<br>
mass spectrometry.<br><br>
The materials ane methods used in these experiments are now described.<br>
TheCri-IgGI Monoclonal Antibody. The Cri-lgGl antibody was obtained from R.<br>
Jefferies, MRC Center for Immune Regulation, The Medical School, University of<br>
Birmingham. UK. The antibody is a non-recombinant antibody, and is isolated from a human<br>
myeloma. The antibody was prepared using three methods. In the first method, referred to as<br>
"DEAL," the antibody was isolated under relatively mild conditions using a DEAE ion<br>
exchange column. In the second method, referred to as "SPA," the antibody was purified on<br>
a protein A column (Staphylococcus aureus protein A) with a low pH elution step. In the<br>
third method, referred to as "Fc." the antibody was treated with a protease so that only the Fc<br>
portion of the antibody remained and the antigen binding domains were removed. These<br>
methods for antibody purification are well known to those of skill in the art and are not<br>
repeated in detail here.<br>
Affinity purification of remodeled antibodies. Antibody, modified either by<br>
cxoglycosidase or glycosyltransferase, was affinity purified on a ProA-sepharose 4-fast How<br>
column (Amersham Bioscience. Arlington Heights, IL ), eluted with 0.1 M glycine-HCl<br>
buffer, pH 2.7, and immediately neutralized with 1 M Tris, pH 9.5. The eluates were buffer-<br>
exchanged using a NAP-10 column (Amersham Bioscience, Arlington Heights, IL) to an<br>
appropriate buffer for the next step of glycosylation, such as 100 mM MES, pH 6.5 or 50 mM<br>
Tris-HCl. pH 7.2. The remodeled final products were dialyzed extensively against PBS at<br>
4°C in Tube-O-Dialyzers™ (Chemicon International, Temecula, CA) with a MWCO of 8<br>
kDa.<br>
In vitro glycosidase treatment of Cri-antibodies. Antibody was buffer-exchanged into<br>
50 mM Na phosphate/Citrate, pH 6.0 using NAP-10 column (Amersham Bioscience.<br>
Arlington Heights. IL). In vitro trimming back of sugar moieties was carried out stepwise, by<br>
contacting the antibody (5 mg/mL) with 20 mU/mg protein neuraminidase at 37°C overnight<br>
(to remove terminal sialic acid moieties ). 20 mU/mg protein P-galactosidase at 37°C,<br>
overnight (to remove terminal galactose moieties to result in the GO glycoform), and/or 2<br>
U/mg p-N-acetylhexosaminidase (from Jack Bean, Seikagaku, Tokyo. Japan) at 37°C.<br>
overnight (to remove terminal N-acetyl glucosamine to result in the M3N2 glycoform). The<br>
samples were affinity purified as described above.<br>
In vitro glycosvlation of Cri-antibodies. In vitro GnTI modification was performed<br>
using 1 mg/ml of the M3N2 glycoform antibody as the substrate, and 25 mU/mg of<br>
recombinant human ß1,2-mannosyl-UDP-N-acetylglucosaminosyltransferase in a buffer of<br>
100 mM MES. pll 6.5. 5 mM MnCI2, 5 mM UDP-GlcNAc, and 0.02% NaN3 at 32°C for 24<br>
hr. An aliquot was removed for glycan analysis, and the resulting products were affinity<br>
purified as described above.<br>
In vitro modification of the bisecting-glycoform was carried out using 1 mg/ml of the<br>
M3N2 glycoform antibody as the substrate and 25 mU/mg of (31,2-recombinant human<br>
mannosyl-UDP-N-acetylglucosaminosyltransferase I, 25 mU/mg of [31,2-recombinant human<br>
mannosyl-UDP-N-acetylglucosaminosyltransferase II and 3.5 mU/mg of ß1,4-recombinant<br>
mouse mannosyl-UDP-N-acetylglucosaminosyltransferase III in a buffer of 100 mM MES<br>
pH 6.5. 10 mM MnCl2, 5 mM UDP-GlcNAc, and 0.02% NaTM3 at 32°C for 24 hrs. An aliquot<br>
was removed for glycan analysis, and the remaining product was affinity purified as<br>
described above.<br>
In vitro galactosylation was performed using GO glycoform antibody or bisecting<br>
glycoform antibody by contacting the antibody with 0.6 U/mg recombinant bovine milk ß1,4<br>
galactosyltransferase in a buffer of 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM UDP-<br>
galactose. 5 mM MnCl2, at 32°C for 24 hrs. An aliquot was removed for glycan analysis, and<br>
the remaining products were affinity purified as described above.<br>
In vitro sialylation was carried out using the G2 glycoform antibody (1 mg/ml,) by<br>
contacting it with 0.1 U/mg ST3Gal3 or 0.1 U/mg ST6Gall, 5 mM CMP-sialic acid, at 32°C<br>
for 24 hr in a buffer of 50 mM Tris pH 7.4. 150 mM NaCl, and 3 mM CMP-SA. An aliquot<br>
was removed for glycan analysis, and the remaining products were affinity purified as<br>
described above.<br>
Glycan Analysis:<br>
Capillary Electrophoresis with Laser Induced Fluorescence Dectection. Buffer<br>
components and nucleotide sugars were removed from an aliquot of the glycoremodeled<br>
antibody by dilution and concentration in a Microcon™ YM-30 microconcentrator<br>
(Millipore, Bedford, MA). N-linked oligosaccharides were released from the protein by<br>
contacting it with PNGase F (Prozyme, San Leandro, CA) using the methodology provided<br>
by the manufacturer. In brief, the sample was denatured in the buffer of 50 mM sodium<br>
phosphate pH 7.5. 0.1% SDS, and 50 mM P-mercaptoethanol for 10 min at 100°C. TX100<br>
was then added to 0.75% (v/v) as well as 10U PNGaseF/200 |ig protein. After 3 hours<br>
incubation at 37°C, the protein was ethanol precipitated and the supernatant was dried down.<br>
The released free oligosaccharides were then labeled with 8-aminopyrene-1.3,6-trisulfonic<br>
acid and analyzed by capillary electrophoresis with a carbohydrate labeling and analysis kit<br>
from Beckman-Coulter, Inc. (Fullerton, CA), as indicated by the manufacturer (see also. Ma<br>
and Nashabeh, 1999. Anal. Chem. 71:5185-5192).<br>
Capillary electrophoresis (CE) was carried out in an eCAP™ N-CHO coated<br>
Capillary (50 urn I.D.. length to detector 40 cm; Beckman-Coulter, Inc., Fullerton, CA),<br>
using a P/ACE™ MDQ Glycoprotein System (Beckman-Coulter, Inc. Fullerton, CA) with<br>
Laser Induced Fluorescence Detector (Beckman-Coulter, Inc. Fullerton. CA). Samples were<br>
introduced into the cartridge by 20 psi pressure for 10 sec. and separated under 25 kV with<br>
reverse polarity for 20 min. Cartridge temperature was kept at 20°C. The electropherogram<br>
was generated by laser-induced fluorescence detection at an excitation wavelength of 488 nm<br>
and an emission wavelength of 520 nm.<br>
Carbohydrate standards (Calbiochem®, EMD Biosciences, Inc., San Diego, CA).<br>
including M3N2 (N-linked trimannosyl core without core fucose), GO (N-linked<br>
oligosaccharide, asialo, agalacto, biantennary with core fucose), G2 (N-linked<br>
oligosaccharide, asialo, biantennary with core fucose), and G2 without fucose, S1-G2 (mono-<br>
sialylated. galactosylated biantennary oligosaccharide without core fucose) and S2-G2 (di-<br>
sialylated, galactosylated biantennary oligosaccharide without core fucose), (from Glyko. see.<br>
ProZyme, San Leandro. CA), M3N2F (N-linked trimannosyl core with core fucose) and<br>
NGA2F (N-linked oligosaccharide asialo, agalacto, biantennary with core fucose and with<br>
bisecting GlcNAc) were labeled with l-aminopyrene-3,6,8-trisulfonate (APTS. Beckman-<br>
Coulter. Inc. Fullerton. CA) and used to identify the distribution of glycans released from the<br>
antibody.<br>
2-AA HPLC. PNGaseF released glycans were labeled with 2-AA (2-anthranilic acid)<br>
according to the method described by Anumula and Dhume with slight modifications (1998.<br>
Glycobiology 8:685- 694). Reductively-aminated N-glycans were analyzed using a Shodex<br>
Asahipak NH2P-50 4D amino column (4.6 mm x 150 mm) (Showa Denko K.K., Tokyo.<br>
Japan). The two solvents used for the separation are A) 2% acetic acid and 1 %<br>
tetrahydrofuran in acetonitrile and B) 5% acetic acid, 3% triethylamine and 1%<br>
tetrahydrofuran in water.<br>
To separate neutral 2AA-labeled glycans, the column was eluted isocratically with<br>
70% A for 5 minutes, followed by a linear gradient over a period of 60 minutes going from<br>
70% to 50% B, followed by a steep gradient over a period of 5 minutes going from 50% to<br>
5% B and a final isocratic elution with 5% B for 10 minutes. Eluted peaks were detected<br>
using fluorescence detection with an excitation at 230 nm and detection wavelength at 420<br>
nm. In this gradient condition, the GO glycoform will elute at about 30.5 minutes, the Gl<br>
glycoform at about 34.0 minutes and the G2 glycoform at about 37.0 minutes. Under these<br>
conditions, the presence of fucose does not change the elution time.<br>
To separate anionic 2AA-labeled glycans, the column was eluted isocratically with<br>
70% A for 2.5 minutes, followed by a linear gradient over a period of 97.5 min going from<br>
70% to 5% A and a final isocratic elution with 5% A for 15 minutes. Eluted peaks were<br>
detected using fluorescence detection with excitation at 230 nm and detection at 420 nm. In<br>
this gradient, neutral glycans are expected to elute between 18.00 - 29.00 minutes, glycans<br>
with one charge elute between 30.00 - 40.00 minutes, glycans with two charges elute<br>
between 43.00 - 52.00 minutes, glycans with three charges elute between 54.00 - 63.00<br>
minutes, and glycans with four charges elute between 65.00 - 74.00 minutes.<br>
MALD1 analysis of reductively-aminated N-glycans. A small aliquot of the PNGase-<br>
released N-glycans that were labeled with 2-anthranilic acid (2AA) were then dialyzed for 45<br>
minutes on a MF-Millipore membrane filter (0.025 urn pore, 47 mm dia.), which was floating<br>
on water. The dialyzed aliquot was dried in a Speedvac™ (ThermoSavant, Holbrook, NY),<br>
redissolved in a small amount of water, and mixed with a solution of 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic<br>
acid (10 g/L) dissolved in water/acetonitrile (50:50).<br>
The mixture was dried onto a MALD1 target and analyzed using an Applied<br>
Biosystems DH-Pro mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems, Inc.. Foster City. CA) operated<br>
in the linear/negative-ion mode. Oligosaccharide structures were assigned based on the<br>
observed mass-to-chargc ratio and literature precedence. No attempt was made to fully<br>
characterize isobaric structures.<br>
SDS-PAGB. To determine the stability of the glycoremodeled antibody, all the<br>
samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The final products of the samples were run under<br>
non-reducing conditions using 8-16% Tris-glycine gel (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Bovine<br>
serum albumin was run under reducing condition as quantitative standards. The gel was<br>
stained with GelCode Blue Stain Reagent (Pierce Chemical Co., Rockford, IL) for<br>
visualization.<br>
The results of the experiments are now described.<br>
Native glycoforms of Cri expressed in human myeloma cells. Cri-IgGl antibody<br>
purified from the serum of a patient having multiple myeloma contains variable glycoforms.<br>
Figure 97A-97C shows the HPLC profiles of glycans enzymatically released from Cri-IgGl<br>
antibody. Figure 98A-98C shows the MALDI profiles of glycans enzymatically released<br>
from Cri-IgG 1 antibody expressed in human myeloma cells. The major forms are under-<br>
galactosylated GO. Gl, while G2 and sialylated structures are relatively minor (Table 14 and<br>
Figure 97C). To test the impact of modified glycans on the therapeutic properties of the<br>
monoclonal antibody, Cri-IgGl antibody was modified by performing in vitro<br>
exoglycosidases trimming and in vitro glycosylation remodeling to generate different<br>
glycoforms of this antibody.<br>
Initially, optimization of each step in exoglycosidases trimming and glyeosylation<br>
was performed at small scale (100 |ug of each).<br>
Trimannosyl core glycoform of Cri-lgGl Antibody (M3N2). M3N2 was created by<br>
stepwise treatment of glycosidases, including neuraminidase, ß1,4-galactosidase and ß1-2, 3.<br>
4. 6 N-acetylhexosaminidase. To assess the removal of terminal galactose and GlcNAc on<br>
the glycoremodeled Cri-lgGl antibody samples, a quantitative capillary electrophoresis (CE)<br>
method was used. The glycans were enzymatically released from the glycoremodeled<br>
antibody with PNGase F and were derivatized with 8-aminopyrene-l,3,6-trisulfonic acid<br>
(APTS) at the reducing terminus. The resulting products were analyzed by CE with on-<br>
column laser-induced fluorescence detection (LIF) (Ma &amp; Nashabeh, 1999, supra). Since the<br>
separation of the glycans is based on the differences in hydrodynamic size, the APTS labeled<br>
glycans migrate in order of increasing size (M3N2
Figures 99A-99D show the electropherograms indicating the glycans released from<br>
glycoremodeled Cri-lgGl antibody as well as glycan standards derivatized with APTS<br>
(Figure 99A). The glycoforms were identified by comparing their electrophoretic mobilities<br>
to the standards. The relative amount of each glycan species was calculated from the relative<br>
area percentage of each indicated peak, and the results are presented in Table 15. The<br>
M3N2F glycoform represents 91% of the glycans of DEAE-Cri, 80% of the glycans of SPA-<br>
Cri. and 100% of the glycans of Fc-Cri. Incomplete removal of GlcNAc moiety resulting in<br>
the GnT-I-M3N2F glycoform (see. Table 15) was observed in the glycan structures from<br>
DEAE-Cri (8.6%) and SPA-Cri (-20%). Glycoform GnT-I-M3N2F is the M3N2F glycoform<br>
with one additional GlcNAc, such as would be added by GnT-I.<br>
Degalactosylated glycoform (GO). Cri-IgG 1 antibody with GO glycoforms was<br>
obtained by stepwise treatment the native Cri-IgG 1 antibody with neuraminidase and ß1,4-<br>
galactosidase in for 24 hours for each reaction. The glycans released from the<br>
glycoremodeled antibody were analyzed by CE, HPLC and MALD1. Figure 100A shows the<br>
CE profile of the released glycans. In all three samples, only one peak was observed which<br>
was designated as the GO glycoform based on comparison with the standards (Fig. 100A and<br>
Tabic 16).<br><br>
In addition to the glycan analysis provided by CE, a quantitative HPLC method was<br>
also used to determine the percent of the GO glycoform represented by remodeled glycans of<br>
the Cri-IgG 1 antibody. The glycan distribution on the glycoremodeled antibody was<br>
monitored by enzymatically releasing the glycans with PNGase F and derivatizing the<br>
released products with 2-anthranilic acid (2-AA) at the reducing terminus. The derivatized<br>
mixture was separated by HPLC on a Shodex Asahipak NH2P-50 4D column with<br>
fluorescence detection. Figures 101A-101C show the chromatograms obtained from the<br>
released glycans. HPLC results confirmed CE analysis, as only one major peak was found in<br>
all three samples. In agreement with CE and HPLC data, MALDI analysis also showed<br>
almost complete glycoremodeling to the GO glycoform (Fig. 102A-102C).<br>
Fully galactosylated G2 glycoform CG2). Cri-IgG antibodies were treated with<br>
neuraminidase to yield asialo-glycoforms which were also under galactosylated. These<br>
asialoglycoforms were then treated with 0.6 U/ml of bovine ß1.4 galactosyltransferase and a<br>
galactose donor molecule to glycoremodel the antibody to have the G2 glycoform.<br>
The extent of terminal galactosylation was determined by glycan analysis. Only one<br>
major peak was observed in both CH and HPLC profiles (Figure 103A-103C and Fig. 104A-<br>
104C). This peak corresponds to the G2 glycoform in each case. Calculation of the percent<br>
total peak area showed almost complete (-90%) conversion to the G2 from the under<br>
galactosylated glycoforms of the original samples (see, Table 14). These results are<br>
summarized in Table 17. MALDI analysis of the glycans further supported the almost to<br>
complete glycoremodcling to the G2 glycoform in all of the samples (Fig. 105A-105C).<br><br>
GnT-1-glycoform (GnT-I-M3N2). The M3N2 glycoform Cri-IgG antibody was<br>
glycoremodeled to the GnT-I-M3N2 glycoform by adding one GlcNAc moiety to the<br>
molecule. The molecule was contacted with 25 mU GnT-I/mg antibody and an appropriate<br>
GlcNAc donor molecule. CE, HPLC and MALDI analysis of released glycans (Figures<br>
106A-106D, Figures 107A-107C and Fig. 108A-108C, respectively) indicated that the<br>
original M3N2F glycoform was completely remodeled. However, only 40-60% of the<br>
modified structures were the GnT-I-M3N2 glycoform, and about 30% were the GO<br>
glycoform. The presence of the GO glycoform may be the result of incomplete GlcNAc<br>
trimming when making the original M3N2 form.<br>
Bisecting glycoform (NGA2F). The M3N2 glycoform Cri-IgG antibody was<br>
glycoremodeled to the NGA2F glycoform by contacting it with a combination the three<br>
transferases, GnT-I, GnT-II and GnT-III, and an appropriate N-acetylglucosamine donor<br>
molecule. The reaction was completed in 24 hours. To determine the extent to which the<br>
bisecting-GlcNAc moiety was added to the glycans, CE analysis was used to determine the<br>
glycoforms present on the glycoremodeled antibody.<br><br>
Figure 109A-109D shows the electropherograms obtained from CE analysis of the<br>
glycans released from glycoremodeled Cri-IgGl antibody. Four peaks appeared after<br>
remodeling. A major peak migrated at the same retention time as the NGA2F standard<br>
glycoform. The three other minor peaks are likely to be the incompletely remodeled glycans.<br>
For comparison, a quantitative HPLC method was also used, where the 2-AA labeled glycans<br>
elulcd in order of increasing size (Gnl 
similar results were obtained from the CE analysis of the glycans. No M3N2F was found<br>
using either the CE or HPLC analysis. NGA2F glycans were the major peaks 1 both CE and<br>
HPLC analysis. The Gnl and GO glycans still remaining in the sample likely are the result of<br>
incomplete modification. Most of the original M3N2F glycoforms were remodeled by three<br>
GlcNAc moieties to the NGA2F glycoform (60-70%), about 15-18% were remodeled by the<br>
addition of two GlcNAc moieties to the GO glycoform, and only small amount (~ 7%) were<br>
remodeled by the addition of only one GlcNAc moiety. MALDI-MS analysis of the released<br>
glycans (Figure 111 A.- 111 C) shows peaks of glycoforms with one, two or three terminal<br>
GlcNAc moieties, in agreement with CE and HPLC analysis (Figures 109 and 110). The<br>
relative amount of each glycan species was calculated from the relative area percentage of<br>
each indicated peak, and is summarized in Table 18.<br>
Galactosvlated Bisecting (Gal-NGA2F) glvcoforms. NGA2F glycoforms of Cri-lgGl<br>
antibodies were glycoremodeled with bovine ß 1,4-galactosyltransferase and an appropriate<br>
galactose donor. The terminal galactose moieties were added using 0.6 U/ml of ß 1.4<br>
galactosyltransferase. Figure 112A-112D shows the electropherograms obtained using the 2-<br>
AA HPLC method. In brief, the glycoforms terminating in GalNAc were almost 100%<br>
galactosylated. Comparing Figure 112A to Figure 112B for DEAE Cri-lgGl, and Figure<br>
112C to Figure 112D for Fc Cri-lgGl, the 2-AA HPLC profile of GnT-I. II and III modified<br>
glycans (Figures 1 12A and 112C) is modified by GalTl so that all of the glycan peakes were<br>
shifted to elute later due to the size increase from added galactose moieties (Fig. 112B and<br>
112D). These results were further confirmed by MALDI-MS analysis.<br>
Sialvlated (S2G2) glvcoforms of Cri-lgGl. The glycoremodeled G2 glycoforms of<br>
Cri-lgGl antibody were further remodeled using both ST3Gal3 and ST6Gall. Figure 113A-<br>
I 13C shows the IIPLC profile of the G2 glycoforms remodeled with ST3Gal3. Most of the<br>
G2 glycoforms were converted into S2G2 glycoforms (the G2 glycoform with 2 additional<br>
terminal sialic acid moieties; -70%, see, Table 19), and only small amounts were the S1G2<br>
glycoform (the G2 glycoform with 1 additional terminal sialic acid moiety; 
19). These results were further confirmed in the MALDI analysis shown in Figures 114A-<br>
114C. MALDI data also shows that all the G2 glycoforms were sialylatcd to either S2G2 or<br>
SIG2 glycoforms.<br>
By comparison. ST6Gall remodeling of the GO glycoform did not reach the level of<br>
completion found with ST3Gal3 remodeling. Figure 115A-115D and Figure 116A-116C<br>
show the results obtained from CE and UPLC analysis, respectively. No S2G2 glycoforms<br>
were seen in any of the glycoremodeled samples. However, all of the G2 glycoforms were<br>
converted into S1-G2. Analysis from MALDI-MS also supports these data (Figures 117A-<br>
117C).<br>
Stability of remodeled glycans of Cri-IgGl. Lastly, the stability of the Cri-IgG 1<br>
glycans remodeled by exoglycosidase treatment and glycosylation was investigated. Each<br>
glycoremodeled Cri-IgGl antibody was stored at 4°C. and was checked by SDS-PAGE for<br>
degradation at two weeks after remodeling. As shown in Figure 1 18A-118E, the remodeled<br>
DEAE and SPA antibodies both retained a molecular weight of about 150 kDa, indicating<br>
little to no degradation, regardless of the kind of glycoremodeling performed. The Fc Cri-<br>
lgGl antibody retained a molecular weight of about 38 kDa, also indicating little to no<br>
degradation, regardless of the kind of remodeling performed.<br>
Effector Function Bioassay of Remodeled Cri-IgGl antibodies. The effector function<br>
bioassay was derived from the procedure of Mimura et al. (2000, Molecular Immunology<br>
37:697-706). The IC50 of the glycoforms of Cri-IgGl antibody was determined by inhibition<br>
of the superoxide response of U937 cells elicited by red blood cells sensitized with native<br>
anti-NIP antibody.<br>
Monocytic U937 cells were cultured in the presence of 1000 units/mL interferon<br>
gamma for 2 days to induce the differentiation of the cells and their capacity to generate<br>
superoxide. The cells were then washed and resuspended at 2 x 106 cells/mL in Hanks<br>
balanced salt solution without phenol red and containing 20 mM HEPES pH 7.4 and 0.15<br>
mM BSA. The red blood cells were sensitized with anti-NIP (5-iodo-4-hydroxy-3-<br>
nitrophenacetyl) antibody, in the absence or presence of the various glycoforms of Cri-IgGl<br>
antibody, with incubation at 37°C for 30 minutes. The cells were then washed three times<br>
with PBS and resuspended at 2.5 x 107 cells/mL in HBSS-BSA. The U937 cells (100 µl 2 x<br>
106 cells/mL) were added to plastic tubes and lucigenin (20 µl, 2.5 mM) was added to the<br>
tubes. The tubes were warmed in a 37°C water bath for 5 minutes. The sensitized red blood<br>
Us (80 µl. 2.5 x 107/mL) were then added to the tubes. Superoxide anion production was<br>
measured by lucigenin-enhanced chemiluminescence at 37°C over a 30 minute period using a<br>
Berthold LV953 luminometer (Berthold Australia Pty Ltd. Bundoora, Australia).<br>
The GO and M3N2 glycoforms Cri-IgGl antibody had relative inhibitory values ol"<br>
92% and 85%, respectively, as compared with the native antibody. However, the native CR1-<br>
IgG 1 antibody lacked core fucose. Shields et al. (2002, J. Biol. Chem. 277:26733-26740)<br>
suggests that the lack of core fucose will improve inhibitory values 10 fold. Based on these<br>
results, it is anticipated that inhibitory values of the galactosylated-bisecting-GO glycoform<br>
will be greater than the bisecting-GO glycoform, which in turn will be much greater than the<br>
G2 glycoform, which in turn will be approximately equal to the disialylated-G2 glycoform<br>
and the monosialylated-G2 glycoform, which in turn will be greater than the native antibody<br>
glycoform, which in turn will be greater than the GO glycoform, which in turn will be greater<br>
than the M3N2 glycoform.<br>
Complement Receptor-1<br>
9. Sialylation and Fucosylation of TP10<br>
This example sets forth the preparation of TP10 with sialyl Lewis X moieties and<br>
analysis of enhanced biological activity.<br>
Interrupting blood flow to the brain, even for a short time, can trigger inflammatory<br>
events within the cerebral micro vasculature that can exacerbrate cerebral tissue damage. The<br>
tissue damage that accrues is amplified by activation of both inflammation and coagulation<br>
cascades. In a murine model of stroke, increased expression of P-selectin and ICAM-1<br>
promotes leukocyte recruitment. sCRl is recombinant form of the extracellular domain of<br>
Complement Receptor-1 (CR-1). sCR-1 is a potent inhibitor of complement activation.<br>
sCRlsLex (CD20) is an alternately glycosylated form of sCRl that is alternately<br>
glycosylated to display sialylated Lewisx antigen. Previously, sCR-lsLeX that was<br>
expressed and glycosylated in vivo in engineered Lecl 1 CHO cells was found to correctly<br>
localize to ischemic cerebral microvessels and Clq-expressing neurons, thus inhibiting<br>
neutrophil and platelet accumulation and reducing cerebral infarct volumes (Huang et al..<br>
1999. Science 285:595-599). In the present example, sCRlsLex which was prepared in vitro<br>
by remodeling of glycans. exhibited enhanced biological activity similar to that of sCRsLe<br>
glycosylated in vivo.<br>
The TPIO peptide was expressed in DUK Bl 1 CHO cells. This CHO cell line<br>
produces the TPIO peptide with the typical CHO cell glycosylation, with many but not all<br>
glycans capped with sialic acid.<br>
Sialylation of 66 mg of TPIO. TPIO (2.5 mg/mL), CMPSA (5 mM), and ST3Gal3<br>
(0.1 U/mL) were incubated at 32°C in 50 mM Tris, 0.15M NaCl, 0.05% sodium azide, pH 7.2<br>
for 48 hours. Radiolabeled CMP sialic acid was added to a small aliquot to monitor<br>
incorporation. TP10 was separated from nucleotide sugar by SEC HPLC. Samples analyzed<br>
at 24 hours and 48 hours demonstrated that the reaction was completed after 24 hours. The<br>
reaction mixture was then frozen. The reaction products were subjected to Fluorophore<br>
Assisted Carbohydrate Electrophoresis (FACE®; Glyko, Inc, Novato CA) analysis (Figure<br>
119).<br>
Pharmacokinetic studies. Rats were purchased with a jugular vein cannula. 10<br>
mg/kg of either the pre-sialylation or post-sialylation TP10 peptide was given by tail vein<br>
injection to three rats for each treatment (n=3). Fourteen blood samples were taken from 0 to<br>
50 hours. The concentration in the blood of post-sialylation TP10 peptide was higher than<br>
that of pre-sialylation TP10 at every time point past 0 hour (Figure 120). Sialic acid addition<br>
doubled the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) of the pharmacokinetic<br>
curve as compared to the starting material (Figure 121).<br>
Fucosylation of sialylated TP10. 10 mL (25 mgTPIO) of the above sialylation mix<br>
was thawed, and GDP-fucose was added to 5 mM, MnCI2 to 5 mM, and FTV1<br>
(fucosyltransferase VI) to 0.05 U/mL. The reaction was incubated at 32°C for 48 hours. The<br>
reaction products were subjected to Fluorophore Assisted Carbohydrate Electrophoresis<br>
(FACE*; Glyko, Inc. Novato CA) analysis (Figure 122). To a small aliquot, radiolabeled<br>
GDP-fucose was added to monitor incorporation. TP10 was separated from nucleotide sugar<br>
by SEC HPLC. Samples analyzed at 24 hours and 48 hours demonstrated that the reaction<br>
was completed at 24 hours. An in vitro assay measuring binding to E-selectin indicate that<br>
fucose addition can produce a biologically-active E-selectin ligand (Figure 123).<br>
Enbrel™<br>
H). GlycoPEGylation of an antibody Enbrel™<br>
This example sets forth the procedures to PEGylate the O-linked glycans of an<br>
antibody molecule. Here, Enbrel™ is used as an example, however one of skill in the art will<br>
appreciate that this procedure can be used with many antibody molecules.<br>
Preparation of Enbrel™-SA-PEG (10 kDa). Enbrel™ (TNF-receptor-IgG,-<br>
chimera), either with the O-linked glycans sialylated prior to PEGylation or not. is dissolved<br>
at 2.5 mg/mL in 50 mM Tris-HCl, 0.15 M NaCl. 5 mM MnCI2, 0.05% NaN3, pH 7.2. The<br>
solution is incubated with 5 mM UDP-galactose and 0.1 U/mL of galactosyltransferase at<br>
32"C for 2 days to cap the undergalactosylatcd glycans with galactose. To monitor the<br>
incorporation of galactose, a small aliquot of the reaction has 14C-galactose-UDP ligand<br>
added; the label incorporated into the peptide is separated from the free label by gel filtration<br>
on a Toso Haas G2000SW analytical column in methanol and water. The radioactive label<br>
incorporation into the peptide is quantitated using an in-line radiation detector.<br>
When the reaction is complete, the solution is incubated with 1 mM CMP-sialic acid-<br>
linker-PEG (10 kDa) and 0.1 U/mL of ST3Gal3 at 32"C for 2 days. To monitor the<br>
incorporation of sialic acid-linker-PEG, the peptide is separated by gel filtration on a Toso<br>
Haas G3000SW analytical column using PBS buffer (pH 7.1). When the reaction is<br>
complete, the reaction mixture is purified using a Toso Haas TSK-Gel-3000 preparative<br>
column using PBS buffer (pH 7.1) and collecting fractions based on UV absorption. The<br>
fractions containing product are combined, concentrated, buffer exchanged and then freeze-<br>
dried. The product of the reaction is analyzed using SDS-PAGE and IEF analysis according<br>
to the procedures and reagents supplied by Invitrogen. Samples are dialyzed against water<br>
and analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS.<br>

This example sets forth the addition of a GlcNAc residue on to a tri-mannosyl core.<br>
Addition of GlcNAc to EPO. EPO was expressed in SF-9 insect cells and purified<br>
(Protein Sciences, Meriden, CT). A 100% conversion from the tri-mannosyl glycoform of<br>
Kpo to the "tri-mannosyl core + 2 GlcNAc" (Peak I. PI in Figure 124) was achieved in 24<br>
hours of incubation at 32°C with 100mU/ml of GlcNAcT-I and 100mU/ml of GlcNAcT-ll in<br>
the following reaction final concentrations:<br>

Analysis of glycoforms. This assay is a slight modification on K-R. Anumula and ST<br>
Dhume, Glycobiology 8 (1998) 685-69. N-glycanase (PNGase) released N-glycans were<br>
reductively labeled with anthranilic acid. The reductively-aminated N-glycans were injected<br>
onto a Shodex Asahipak NH2P-50 4D amino column (4.6 mm x 150 mm). Two solvents<br>
were used for the separation: A) 5% (v/v) acetic acid, 1% tetrahydrofuran, and 3%<br>
triethylamine in water, and B) 2% acetic acid and 1% tetrahydrofuran in acetonitrile. The<br>
column was then eluted isocratically with 70% B for 2.5 minutes, followed by a linear<br>
gradient over a period of 97.5 minutes going from 70 to 5% B and a final isocratic elution<br>
with 5% B for 15 minutes. Eluted peaks were detected using fluorescence detection with an<br>
excitation of 230 nm and emission wavelength of 420 nm.<br>
Under these conditions, the trimannosyl core had a retention time of 22.3 minutes, and<br>
the product of the GnT reaction has a retention time of 30 minutes. The starting material was<br>
exclusively trimannosyl core with core GlcNAc (Figure 124).<br>
12. Preparation of EPO with multi-antennary complex glycans<br>
This example sets forth the preparation of PEGylated, biantennary F.PO, and<br>
triantennary, sialylated EPO from insect cell expressed EPO.<br>
Recombinant human erythropoietin (rhEPO) from the baculovirus/Sf9 expression<br>
system (Protein Sciences Corp., Meriden, CT) was subjected to glycan analysis and the<br>
resulting glycans were shown to be primarily trimannosyl core with core fucose, with a small<br>
percentage of glycans also having a single GlcNAc.<br>
Addition of N-acetylglucosamine with GnT-I and GnT-II. Two lots of rhEPO (1<br>
mg/mL) were incubated with GnT-I and GnT-II, 5 mM UDP-glcNAc, 20 mM MnCl2. and<br>
0.02% sodium azide in 100 mM MES pH 6.5 at 32°C for 24hr. Lot A contained 20 mg of<br>
EPO. and 100 mU/mL GnT-I and 60 mU/mL GnT-II. Lot B contained 41 mg of EPO, and 41<br>
mU/iriL GnT-I + 50 mU/ml. GnT-II. After the reaction, the sample was desalted by gel<br>
filtration (PD10 columns. Pharmacia LKB Biotechnology Inc., Piscataway, NJ).<br>
EPO glycans analyzed by 2-AA HPLC profiling. This assay is a slight<br>
modification on Anumula and Dhume, Glycobiology 8 (1998) 685-69. Reductively-aminated<br>
N-glycans were injected onto a Shodex Asahipak NH2P-50 4D amino column (4.6 mm x 150<br>
mm). Two solvents were used for the separation. A) 5% (v/v) acetic acid, 1 %<br>
tetrahydrofuran, and 3% triethylamine in water and B) 2% acetic acid and 1% tetrahydrofuran<br>
in acetonitrile. The column was then eluted isocratically with 70% B for 2.5 min, followed<br>
by a linear gradient over a period of 100 min going from 70 to 5% B, and a final isocratic<br>
elution with 5% B for 20 min. Eluted peaks were detected using fluorescence detection with<br>
an excitation of 230 nm and emission wavelength of 420 nm. Non-sialylated N-linked<br>
glycans fall in the LC range of 23-34 min, monosialylated from 34-42 min. disialylated from<br>
42-52 min, trisialylated from 55-65 min and tetrasialylated from 68 - 78 min.<br>
Glycan profiling by 2AA HPLC revealed that lot A was 92% converted to a<br>
biantennary structure with two GlcNAcs (the balance having a single GlcNAc. Lot B showed<br>
97% conversion to the desired product (Figure 125A and 125B ).<br>
Introducing a third antennary branch with GnT-V. EPO (1 mg/mL of lot B) from<br>
the product of the GnT-I and GnT-II reactions, after desalting on PD-10 columns and<br>
subsequent concentration, was incubated with 10 mU/mL GnT-V and 5 mM UDP-GlcNAc in<br>
100 mM MES pH 6.5 containing 5 mM MnCI2 and 0.02% sodium azide at 32°C for 24 hrs.<br>
2AA HPLC analysis demonstrated that the conversion occurred with 92% efficiency (Figure<br>
126).<br>
After desalting (PD-10) and concentration, galactose was added with rGalTl: EPO (1<br>
mg/mL) was incubated with 0.1 U/mL GalTl, 5 mM UDP-galactose, 5 mM MnCI2 at 32°C<br>
for 24 hrs.<br>
MALDI analysis of reductively-aminated N-glycans from EPO. A small aliquot<br>
of the PNGase released N-glycans from EPO that had been reductively labeled with<br>
anthranilic acid was dialyzed for 45 min on an MF-Millipore membrane filter (0.025 µm<br>
pore, 47 mm dia). which was floating on water. The dialyzed aliquot was dried in a<br>
speedvac, redissolved in a small amount of water, and mixed with a solution of 2.5-<br>
dihydroxybenzoic acid (10 g/L) dissolved in water/acetonitrile (50:50). The mixture was<br>
dried onto the target and analyzed using an Applied Biosystems DE-Pro MALDI-TOF mass<br>
spectrometer operated in the linear/negative-ion mode. Oligosaccharides were assigned<br>
based on the observed mass-to-charge ratio and literature precedence.<br>
Analysis of released glycans by MALDI showed that galactose was added<br>
quantitatively to all available sites (Figure 127). Galactosylated EPO from above was then<br>
purified by gel filtration on a Superdex 1.6/60 column in 50 mM Tris, 0.15M NaCl, pH 6.<br>
Sialylation. After concentration and desalting (PD-10), 10 mg galactosylated KPO (1<br>
mg/mL) was incubated with ST3Gal3 (0.05 U/mL), and CMP-SA ß mM) in 50 mM Tris.<br>
150 mM NaCl, pH 7.2 containing 0.02% sodium azide. A separate aliquot contained<br>
radiolabeled CMP-SA. The resulting incorporated label and free label was separated by<br>
isocratic size exclusion chromatography/HPLC at 0.5mL/min in 45% MeOH, 0.1%TFA<br>
(7.8mm x 30 cm column, particle size 5 µm, TSK G2000SWXL, Toso Haas, Ansys<br>
Technologies, Lake Forest, CA). Using this procedure. 12% of the counts were incorporated<br>
ß60 micromolar. at 33 micromolar EPO, or about 10.9 moles/mole). Theoretical ß N-linked<br>
sites, tri-antennary) is about 9 moles/mole incorporation. These correspond within the limits<br>
of the method. In an identical reaction with ST6Gall instead of ST3Gal3. 5.7% of the<br>
radiolabel was incorporated into the galactosylated EPO, or about 48% compared with<br>
ST3Gal3.<br>
13. GlycoPEGylation of EPO produced in insect cells<br>
This example sets forth the prepartion of PEGylated biantennary EPO from insect cell<br>
expressed EPO.<br>
Recombinant human erythropoietin (rhEPO) from the baculovirus/Sf9 expression<br>
system (Protein Sciences Corp.. Meriden, CT) was subjected to glycan analysis and the<br>
resulting glycans were shown to be primarily trimannosyl core with core fucose, with a small<br>
percentage of glycans also having a single GlcNAc (Figure 128).<br>
Addition of N-acetylglucosamine with GnT-I and GnT-II. Two lots of rhEPO (I<br>
mg/mL) were incubated with GnT-I and GnT-II, 5 mM UDP-glcNAc, 20 mM MnCl2. and<br>
0.02% sodium azide in 100 mM MES pH 6.5 at 32°C for 24hr. Lot A contained 20 mg of<br>
HPO. and 100 mlJ/mL GnT-I and 60 mU/mL GnT-II. Lot B contained 41 mg of EPO. and 41<br>
mU/µL GnT-I + 50 mU/mL GnT-II. After the reaction, the sample was desalted by gel<br>
filtration (PD10 columns, Pharmacia LKB Biotechnology Inc., Piscataway, NJ).<br>
Glycan profiling by 2AA HPLC revealed that lot A was 92% converted to a<br>
biantennary structure with two GlcNAcs (the balance having a single glcNAc. Lot B showed<br>
97% conversion to the desired product (Figure 125A and 125B ).<br>
Galactosylation of EPO lot A. EPO (-16 mgs of lot A) was treated with GnT-II to<br>
complete the addition of GlcNAc. The reaction was carried out in 50 mM Tris pH 7.2<br>
containing 150 mM NaCl, EPO mg/ml, 1 mM UDP-GlcNAc, 5 mM MnCl2. 0.02% sodium<br>
a/ide and 0.02 U/ml GnT-II at 32 C for 4 hrs. Then galactosylation of EPO was done by<br>
adding UDP-galactose to 3 mM and GalTl to 0.5 U/ml and the incubation continued at 32° C<br>
for 48 hrs.<br>
Galactosylated EPO was then purified by gel filtration on a Superdex75 1.6/60<br>
column in 50 mM Tris. 0.15M NaCl, pH 6. The EPO containing peak was then analyzed by<br>
2AA HPLC. Based on the HPLC data -85% of the glycans contains two galactose and -15%<br>
of the glycans did not have any galactose after galactosylation reaction.<br>
Sialylation of galactosylated EPO. Sialylation of galactosylated EPO was carried<br>
out in 100 mM Tris pH containing 150 mM NaCl, 0.5 mg/ml EPO, 200 mU/ml of ST3Gal3<br>
and either 0.5 mM CMP-SA or CMP-SA-PEG (1 kDa) or CMP-SA-PEG (10 kDa) for 48 hrs<br>
at 32 °C. Almost all of the glycans that have two galactose residues were fully sialylated (2<br>
sialic acids / glycan) after sialylation reaction with CMP-SA. MALDI-TOF analysis<br>
confirmed the HPLC data.<br>
PEGylation of galactosylated EPO. For PEGylation reactions using CMP-SA-PEG<br>
(1 kDa) and CMP-SA-PEG (10 kDa), an aliquot of the reaction mixture was analyzed by<br>
SDS-PAGE (Figure 129). The molecular weight of the EPO peptide increased with the<br>
addition of each sugar, and increased more dramatically in molecular weight after the<br>
PEGylation reactions.<br>
In vitro bioassay of EPO. In vitro EPO bioassay (adapted from Hammerling et al.<br>
1996, J. Pharm. Biomcd. Anal. 14: 1455-1469) is based on the responsiveness of the TF-1<br>
cell line to multiple levels of EPO. TF-1 cells provide a good system for investigating the<br>
proliferation and differentiation of myeloid progenitor cells. This cell line was established b&gt;<br>
T. Kitamura et al. in October 1987 from a heparinized bone marrow aspiration sample from a<br>
35 year old Japanese male with severe pancytopenia. These cells are completely dependent<br>
on Interleukin 3 or Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF).<br>
The TF-1 cell line (ATCC, Cat. No. CRL-2003) was grown in RPM1 + FBS 10% +<br>
GM-CSF (12 ng/ml) and incubated at 37°C 5% C02. The cells were in suspension at a<br>
concentration of 5000 cells/ml of media, and 200 µl were dispensed in a 96 well plate. The<br>
cells were incubated with various concentrations of EPO (0.1 µg/ml to 10 µg/ml) for 48 hours.<br>
A MTT Viability Assay was then done by adding 25 µl of MTT at 5 mg/ml (SIGMA<br>
M5655), incubating the plate at 37°C for 20 min to 4 hours, adding 100 µl of<br>
isopropanol/HCl solution (100 ml isopropanol + 333 µl HC1 6N), reading the OD at 570 nm.<br>
and 630nm or 690nm. and subtracting the readings at 630 nm or 690 nm from the readings al<br>
570 nm.<br>
Figure 130 contains the results when sialylated EPO, and EPO glycoPEGylated with 1<br>
kDa or 10 kDa PEG was subjected to an in vitro EPO bioactivity test. The EPO<br>
glycoPEGylated with lkDa PEG had almost the same activity as the unglycoPEGylated EPO<br>
when both were at a concentration of approximately 5 µg/ml. The EPO glycoPEGylated with<br>
10 kDa PEG had approximately half the activity of the unglycoPEGylated EPO when both<br>
were at a concentration of approximately 5 µg/ml.<br>

17. Mono-antennary GlycoPEGylation of EPO<br>
This example sets forth the procedure for the preparation of glycoPEGylated mono-<br>
antennary erythropoietin (EPO), and its bioactivity in vitro and in vivo.<br>
When EPO (GenBank Accession No. P01588) is expressed in CHO cells, N-linked<br>
glycans are formed at amino acid residues 24, 38 and 83, and an O-linked glycan is formed at<br>
amino acid residue 126 (Fig. 131; Lai et al., 1986, J. Biol. Chem. 261:3116-3121). The<br>
bioactivity of this glycoprotein is directly correlated with the level of NeuAc content.<br>
Increased sialic acid decreases the binding of EPO to its receptor in vitro: however increased<br>
sialic acid increases the bioactivity of EPO in vivo. The O-linked glycan has no impact on<br>
the in vitro or in vivo activity of EPO, or the pharmacokinetics of the molecule (Wasley et al..<br>
1991, Blood 77:2624-2632).<br>
When EPO is expressed in insect cells, such as is accomplished using a<br>
baculovirus/SP9 expression system (see also, Wojchowshi et al., 1987, Biochem. Biophys.<br>
Acta 910:224-232; Quelle et al., 1989, Blood 74:652-657), N-linked glycans are formed at<br>
amino acid residues 24. 38 and 83, but an O-linked glycan is not formed at amino acid<br>
residue 126 (Fig. 132). This is because the insect cell does not have a glycosyl transferase<br>
that recognizes the amino acid sequence around amino acid residue 126 of EPO. The<br>
majority of the N-linked glycans are composed of GlcNAc2Man3Fuc. In the present example.<br>
EPO expressed in insect cells was remodeled with high efficiency to achieve the complex<br>
glycan SA2Gal2GlcNAc2Man3FucGlcNAc2 by contacting the protein with, in series, GnTI,2.<br>
GalT-1. and ST in the presence of the appropriate donor molecules. These enzymatic<br>
reactions were performed on insect cell expressed EPO using reaction conditions disclosed<br>
herein, to yield the complex glycans herein with 92% total efficiency (Table 21). Optionally,<br>
O-linked glycans can also be added (O'Conncll and Tabak, 1993, J. Dent. Res. 72:1554-<br>
1558; Wang et al., 1993, J. Biol. Chem. .268:22979-22983).<br>
Also in the present example, EPO expressed in insect cells was remodeled to form<br>
mono-antennary, bi-anntenary and tri-antennary glycans, which were subsequently<br>
glycoPEGylated with 1 kDa. 10 kDa and 20 kDa PEG molecules suing procedures described<br>
elsewhere herein. The molecular weights of these EPO forms were determined, and were<br>
compared to Epoetin™ having 3 N-linked glycans, and NESP (Aranesp™) having 5 N-linked<br>
glycans (Fig. 133). Examples of the preparation of bi- and tri-antennary glycan structures are<br>
given in Example 7. herein.<br>
EPO having monoantennary PEGylated glycan structures is prepared by expressing<br>
EPO peptide in insect cells, then contacting the EPO peptide with GnTI only (or alternatively<br>
GnTII only) in the presence of a GlcNAc donor. The EPO peptide is then contacted with<br>
Gall -I in the presence of a galactose donor. The EPO peptide is then contacted with ST in<br>
the presence of SA-PEG donor molecules (Fig. 134A) to generate an EPO peptide having<br>
three N-linked mono-antennary PEGylated glycan structures (Fig. 134B).<br>
The in vitro bioactivity of EPO-SA and EPO-SA-PEG generated from insect cell<br>
expressed EPO was accessed by measuring the ability of the molecule to stimulate the<br>
proliferation of TF-1 erythroleukemia cells. Tri-antennary EPO-SA-PEG 1 kDa exhibited<br>
almost all of the bioactivity of tri-antennary EPO-SA, and di-antennary EPO-SA-PEG 10<br>
kDa exhibited almost all of the bioactivity of di-antennary EPO-SA over a range of EPO<br>
concentrations (Fig. 135). Remodeled and glycoPEGylated EPO generated in insect cells<br>
exhibited up to 94% of the in vitro bioactivity of Epogen™, which is EPO expressed in CHO<br>
cells without further glycan remodeling or PEGylation (Table 22).<br><br>
The in vivo pharmacokinetics of glycoPEGylated and non-glycoPEGylated EPO was<br>
determined. GlycoPEGylated and non-glycoPEGylated [ll23]-labeled EPO was bolus injected<br>
into rats and the pharmacokinetics of the molecules were determined. As compared with bi-<br>
antennary EPO, the AUG of bi-antennary EPO-PEG 1 kDa was 1.8 times greater, and the<br>
AUG of bi-antennary EPO-PEG 10 kDa was 11 times greater (Fig. 136). As compared with<br>
bi-antennary EPO. the AUC of bi-antennary EPO-PEG 1 kDa was 1.6 times greater, and the<br>
AUC of bi-antennary EPO-PEG 10 kDa was 46 times greater (Fig. 136). Therefore, the<br>
pharmacokinetics of EPO was greatly improved by glycoPEGylation.<br>
The in vivo bioactivity of glycoPEGylated and non-glycoPEGylated EPO was also<br>
determined by measuring the degree to which the EPO construct could stimulate<br>
reticulocytosis. Reticulocytosis is a measure of the rate of the maturation of red blood cell<br>
precursor cells into mature red blood cells (erythrocyte). Eight mice per treatment group<br>
were given a single subcutaneous injection of 10 µg protein/Kg, and the percent reticulocytes<br>
was measured at 96 hours (Fig. 137). Tri- and bi-antennary PEGylated EPO exhibited greater<br>
in vivo bioactivity than non-PEGylated EPO forms, including Epogen™.<br>
Further determination of in vivo bioactivity of the EPO constructs was assessed by<br>
measuring the hematocrit (the percent of whole blood that is comprised of red blood cells) of<br>
CD-I female mice 15 days after intraperitoneal injection three times per week with 2.5 µg<br>
peptide/kg body weight of the EPO construct. The hematocrit increment increased with the<br>
size of the EPO form, with the 82.7 kDa mono-antennary EPO-PEG 20 kDa having a slightly<br>
greater activity than the 35.6 kDa NESP (Aranesp™) and about two times the bioactivity of<br>
28.5 kDa Epogen™ (Fig. 138).<br>
This exarnple illustrates that the generation of a longer-acting glycoPEGylated EPO is<br>
feasible. The pharmacokinetic profile of glycoPEGylated EPO can be customized by altering<br>
the number of glycoPEGylation sites and the size of the PEG molecule added to alter the<br>
half-life of the peptide in the bloodstream. Finally, glycoPEGylated EPO retains both in vitro<br>
and in vivo bioactivity.<br>
18. Preparation and Bioactivity of Sialylated and PEGylated Mono-. Bi- and<br>
Tri-Antennary EPO<br>
This example illustrates the production of glycoPEGylated EPO, in particular<br>
PEGylated EPO having mono-antennary and bi-antennary glycans with PEG linked thereto.<br>
The following EPO variants were produced: mono-antennary PEG (1 kDa), PEG (10 kDa)<br>
and PEG (20 kDa); bi-antennary 2,3-sialic acid (SA), bi-antennary SA-PEG (1 kDa), bi-<br>
antennary SA-PEG (10 kDa); tri-antennary 2,3-SA and tri-antennary 2,6-SA capped with 2,3-<br>
SA.<br>
Recombinant erythropoietin (rEPO) expressed in insect cells was obtained from<br>
Protein Sciences (Lot # 060302. Meridan CT). The glycan composition of this batch of EPO<br>
had approximately 98% trimannosyl core structure. Figure 139A depicts the HPLC analysis<br>
of the released glycans from this EPO, with peak "P2" representing the trimannosyl core<br>
glycan. Figure 139B shows the MALDI analysis of the released glycans with the structures<br>
of the released glycans beside the peak they represent.<br>
Mono-antennary branching<br>
Several steps were performed to produce the mono-antennary branched structure. In<br>
brief, the first step was a GnT-I/GalT-1 reaction followed by purification using Superdex-75<br>
chromatography. This reaction adds a GlcNAc moiety to one branch of the tri-mannosyl<br>
core, and a galactose moiety onto the GlcNAc moiety. Branching was extended with the<br>
ST3Gal3 reaction to add the SA-PEG (10 kDa) moiety or the SA-PEG (20 kDa) moiety onto<br>
the terminal galactose moiety. The final purification was accomplished using Superdex-200<br>
chromatography (Amcrsham Biosciences, Arlington Heights, IL).<br>
GnT-I/GalT-1 Reaction. The GnT-I and GalT-1 reactions were combined and<br>
incubated at 32°C for 36 hours. The reaction contained 1 mg/mL EPO, 100 mM Tris-CI pH<br>
7.2, 150 mM NaCL 5 mM MnCl2, 0.02% NaN3, 3 mM UDP-GlcNAc, 50 mU/mg GnT-I, 3<br>
mM UDP-Gal, and 200 mU/mgGalT-1. Figure 140 depicts the MALDI analysis of glycans<br>
released from EPO after the GnT-I/GalT-1 reaction. Glycan analysis showed approximately<br>
90% of the glycans had the desired mono-antennary branched structure with a terminal<br>
galactose moiety.<br>
Superdex 75 Purification. After the GnT-I/GalTl reaction, EPO was purified from<br>
the enzyme protein contaminants and nucleotide sugars using a 1.6 cm x 60 cm Superdex-75<br>
gel filtration chromatography (Amersham Biosciences, Arlington Heights, IL) in PBS<br>
containing 0.02% Tween 20 (Sigma-Aldrich Corp., St. Louis, MO).<br>
ST3Gal3 Reaction. The ST3Gal3 PEGylation reaction was incubated at 32°C for 24<br>
hours. The reaction contained 1 mg/mL EPO, 100 mM Tris-CI pH 7.2. 150 mM NaCl. 0.02%<br>
NaN3. 200 mU/mg ST3Gal3, and 0.5 mM CMP-SA-PEG (10 kDa) or 0.5 mM CMP-SA-PEG<br>
(20 kDa). Figure 141 depicts the SDS-PAGE analysis of EPO after this reaction. The<br>
corresponding molecular weights of the protein bands indicate that the EPO glycans formed<br>
by the GnT-I/GalT-1 reaction were completely sialylated with the PEG derivative.<br><br>
Superdex 200 Purification. EPO then was purified from the contaminants of the<br>
ST3Gal3 reaction by a 1.6 cm x 60 cm Superdex-200 gel filtration chromatography<br>
(Amersham Biosciences, Arlington Heights, 1L) in PBS containing 0.02% Tween-20.<br>
TF-1 Cell In Vitro Bioassay of Mono-antennary PEGylated EPO. The IF-1 cell<br>
line is used to assess the activity of EPO in vitro. The TF-1 cells line is a myeloid progenitor<br>
cell line available from the American Type Culture Collection (Catalogue No. CRL-2003.<br>
Rockville. MD). The cell line is completely dependant on Interleukin-3 or Granulocyte-<br>
Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor for viability. TF-1 cells provide a good system for<br>
investigating the effect of EPO on proliferation and differentiation.<br>
The TF-1 cells were grown in RPMI with 10% FBS and 12 ng/ml GM-CSF at 37°C in<br>
5% C02. The cells were suspended at a concentration of 10,000 cells/ml of media. 200 µl<br>
aliquots of cells were dispensed into a 96-well plate. The cells were incubated with 0.1 to 10<br>
µg/ml EPO for 48 hrs.<br>
The MTT viability assay was then performed by first adding 25 µl of 5 µg/ml MTT<br>
ß-[4,5-dimethlythiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide, orthiazolyl blue; Sigma<br>
Chemical Co., St. Louis, Mo., Catalogue No. M5655). The plate was incubated for 4 hrs at<br>
37°C. 100 µl of isopropanol/HCl solution (100 ml isopropanol and 333 µl HCl 6N) was<br>
added. The absorbency of the plates was read at 570 nm and either 630 or 690 nm, and the<br>
reading at either 630 nm or 690 nm was subtracted for the reading at 570 nm.<br>
Figure 142 depicts the results of the bioassay of EPO activity after PFXiylation of it<br>
mono-antennary glycans. In this bioassay, the mono-antennary PEGylated EPO is much less<br>
active that a non-PEGylated EPO (Epogen).<br>
In Vivo Bioassay of Mono-antennary PEGylated EPO - Examination of<br>
Hematological Parameters.<br>
The effect of EPO-SA-PEG (10 kDa) and EPO-SA-PEG (20 kDa), the preparation of<br>
which compounds is described in detail above, on hematological parameters of male Sprague<br>
Dawley rats was examined. Sprague Dawley rats are a well-studied experimental model and<br>
techniques for the use and care of such animals are well-known to those skilled in the art.<br>
Therefore, Sprague Dawley rats provide a good system for studying the clinical and<br>
physiological effects of EPO-SA-PEG (10 kDa) and EPO-SA-PEG (20 kDa) according to the<br>
present invention.<br>
Preparation, Care, and Handling of Test Subjects. In vivo testing in accordance<br>
with the methods and compositions of the present invention was conducted at Therlmmune<br>
Research Corporation (Gaithersburg, MD). Test subjects for the in vivo studies included 170<br>
male Sprague Davvley rats, obtained from Harlan (Harlan Sprague Dawley, Inc., Indianapolis,<br>
IN). Subjects were all at least 300 grams in weight and at least 70 days old at the time of<br>
shipment. Subjects were cared for according to Therlmmune's Institutional Animal Care and<br>
Use Committee, in accordance with provisions of the USDA Animal Welfare Act. the PI-IS<br>
Policy on Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, and the U.S. Interagency Research<br>
Animal Committee Principles for the Utilization and Care of Research Animals. The study<br>
was conducted in accordance with the FDA Good Laboratory Practice Standards, 21 CFR<br>
Part 58. Subjects were housed individually in polycarbonate cages, under controlled<br>
environmental conditions, and were provided fresh food weekly, ad libitum, and tap water<br>
was made available to test subjects ad libitum via either an automatic watering system or<br>
water bottles.<br>
Subjects were randomly assigned to groups for testing, and the minimum number of<br>
animals needed to give biologically meaningful data were used. Subjects were dosed via<br>
subcutaneous injection, and dosing frequency and quantity is indicated in in Table 25, and<br>
were observed prior to dose administration, and at least twice daily for signs of toxicity,<br>
moribundity and mortality. Body weights were measured and physical examinations were<br>
conducted on subjects pre- and post-study, as well as on a weekly basis during the study.<br>
For hematology studies, a 0.25 ml (± 15%) sample of blood was collected from the<br>
jugular vein of all surviving subjects prior to the first dose on study day one, as well as on<br>
study days 3, 5, 8. 10, 12, 15, 17, 19, 22, 24, 26 and 29. Hematological analysis of the blood<br>
of the test subjects included examination of cellular morphology, erythrocyte count,<br>
hematocrit, hemoglobin, leukocyte, leukocyte differential, mean cell hemoglobin, mean cell<br>
hemoglobin concentration, mean cell volume, mean platelet volume, platelet count, and<br>
reticulocytes.<br>
On study day 29, after clinical pathology blood collection, all surviving subjects were<br>
euthanized via carbon dioxide inhalation. Blood was collected from the abdominal aorta.<br>
Moribund subjects that were previously euthanized, as well as subjects found dead during the<br>
study, were subjected to full necropsy.<br>
Analysis of results and interpretation of data. Quantitative results were analyzed<br>
using techniques known to those skilled in the relevant art. In particular, results were<br>
analyzed using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test for normality, the Levene Median test for equal<br>
variance, and one-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA). In instances where the normality or<br>
equal variance test failed, the analysis was continued using the non-parametric Kruskal-<br>
Wallis ANOVA on rank-transformed data. Parametric data was analyzed using the Dunnett's<br>
t-test to delinieate which groups differed from the control. For non-parametric data, the<br>
Dunns test was used to delineate which groups differed from the control. A probability value<br>
of less than 0.05 (two-tailed) was used as the critical level of significance for all tests.<br>
Based on one analysis of the data from the first fifteen days of the study, it was shown<br>
that a single dose of 50 µg/kg of glycoPEGylated monoantennary EPO, either EPO-SA-PEG<br>
(10 kDa) or EPO-SA-PEG (20 kDa) according to the present invention, gives an extended<br>
rise in blood hemoglobin in rats, comparable to the effect of NESP given at the same dose<br>
(Figure 192). Not wishing to be bound by any particular theory, Figure 192 illustrates that<br>
EPO-SA-PEG (10 kDa) and EPO-SA-PEG (20 kDa) have unexpectedly enhanced biological<br>
properties.<br>
Bi-antennary Branching<br>
Several reactions were performed to accomplish the bi-antennary branching of EPO.<br>
Briefly, the first reaction combined the GnT-1 and GnT-II reactions to add GlcNAc moieties<br>
to two of the tri-mannosyl core branches. The second reaction, the GalT-1 reaction, adds a<br>
galactose moiety to each GlcNAc moieties. Superdex 75 chromatography (Amersham<br>
Biosciences, Arlington Heights, 1L) was performed prior to the ST3Gal3 reaction. The bi-<br>
antennary branching was further extended with the ST3Gal3 reaction to add either a 2,3-SA.<br>
or SA-PEG (1 kDa). SA-PEG (10 kDa). Final purification was accomplished using Superdex<br>
200 chromatagraphy (Amersham Biosciences, Arlington Heights, IL).<br>
GnT-I/GnT-H Reaction. The GnT-I and GnT-11 reactions were combined and<br>
incubated at 32°C for 48 hours. The reaction contained 1 mg/mL EPO, 100 mM MES pH<br>
6.5. 150 mM NaCl, 20 mM MnCl2, 0.02% NaN3, 5 mM UDP-GlcNAc, 100 mU/mg GnT-I.<br>
60 mU/mg GnT-II. The reaction achieved 92% completion of the addition of bi-antennary<br>
GlcMAc moieties, with 8% mono-antennary GlcNAc moieties. Figure 143 A shows the<br>
HPLC analysis of the released glycans, where peak "P3" represents the bi-antennary GlcNAc<br>
glycan. Figure 143B depicts the MALDI analysis of the released glycans with the structures<br>
of the glycans indicated beside the peak that they represent.<br>
In order to further the reaction, an additional 20 mU/mg of GnT-II was added along<br>
with 1 mM UDP-GlcNAc, 5 mM MnCl2, 0.02% NaN3, and the mixure was incubated for 4<br>
hours at 32°C. Greater than 99% of this reaction achieved completion of the bi-antennary<br>
GlcNAc glycan.<br>
GalT-1 Reaction. The GalT-1 reaction was started immediately after the completion<br>
of the second GnT-II reaction. Enzyme and nucleotide sugar were added to the completed<br>
GnT-II reaction at concentrations of 0.5 U/mg GalT-1 and 3 mM UDP-Gal.<br>
When the GalT-1 reaction was performed on a small scale, with about 100 µg EPO<br>
per reaction, approximately 95% of the reaction produced EPO with bi-antennary terminal<br>
galactose moiety. Figure 144A depicts the HPLC analysis of the released glycans where<br>
peak "P2" is the bi-antennary glycan with terminal galactose moieties (85% of the glycans).<br>
and peak "PI" is the bi-antennary glycan without the terminal galactose moieties (15% of the<br>
glycans).<br>
The GalT-1 reaction was also performed on a large scale with about 16 mg of EPO<br>
per reaction. Figure 144B depicts the HPLC analysis of the release glycans from the large<br>
scale GalT-1 reaction, where peak "P2" is the bi-antennary glycan with terminal galactose<br>
moieties, and peak "PI" is the bi-antennary glycan without the terminal galactose moieties.<br>
Superdex 75 Purification. EPO was then purified from the enzyme protein<br>
contaminants and nucleotide sugars using a 1.6 cm x 60 cm Superdex-75 gel filtration<br>
chromatography (Amersham Biosciences, Arlington Heights, 1L) in PBS containing 0.02%<br>
Tween 20 after the GnT-1/GalTl reaction. Figure 145 depicts the chromatogram of the<br>
Superdex 75 gel filtration, where peak 2 is EPO with bi-antennary glycans with terminal<br>
galactose moieties. Figure 146 shows SDS-PAGE analysis of the products of each<br>
remodeling step indicating the increase in the molecular weight of EPO with each remodeling<br>
step.<br>
ST3Gal3 Reaction. The ST3Gal3 reaction was incubated at 32°C for 24 hours. The<br>
reaction contained 0.5 mg/mL EPO, 100 mM Tris-Cl pH 7.2, 150 mM NaCl, 0.02% NaN3.<br>
100 mU/mg ST3Gal3. and 0.5 mM CMP-SA, 0.5 mM CMP-SA-PEG (1 kDa), or 0.5 mM<br>
CMP-SA-PEG (10 kDa). Figure 147 shows the results of SDS-PAGE analysis of EPO before<br>
and after the ST3Gal3 reaction. Based on this SDS-PAGE analysis, bi-antennary EPO<br>
containing terminal Gal can no longer be visually detected after each ST3Gal3 reaction. All<br>
sialylated EPO variants show an increase in size compared to non-sialylated EPO at the start<br>
of the reaction.<br>
Superdex 200 Purification. EPO was purified from the contaminants of the<br>
ST3Gal3 reactions by a 1.6 cm x 60 cm Superdex-200 gel filtration chromatography<br>
(Amersham Biosciences, Arlington Heights, IE) in PBS containing 0.02% Tween-20. Table<br>
23 summaries the distribution of glycan structures at each remodeling step.<br>
Tri-antennary Branching<br>
Several reactions were performed to accomplish the tri-antennary branching of EPO.<br>
Briefly, the first reaction combined the GnT-I and GnT-II reactions to add a GlcNAc moiety<br>
to the two outer tri-mannosyl core branches of the glycan. The second reaction, GnT-V<br>
reaction, adds a second GlcNAc moiety to one of the two outer trimannosyl core branches so<br>
that there are now three GlcNAc moieties. The third reaction, GalT-1 reaction, adds a<br>
galactose moiety to each terminal GlcNAc moiety. The EPO products were then separated<br>
by Superdex 75 chromatography. The tri-antennary branching was further extended with the<br>
ST3Gal3 reaction to add either a 2,3-SA moiety or a 2,6-SA moiety, and capped with a 2,3-<br>
SA moiety. Final purification was accomplished using Superdex 75 chromatography.<br>
GnT-I/GnT-H Reaction. The GnT-I and GnT-I 1 reactions were combined and<br>
incubated at 32°C for 24 hours. The reaction contained 1 mg/mL EPO, 100 mM MES pH<br>
6.5, 150 mM NaCl, 20 mM MnCl2, 0.02% NaN3, 5 mM UDP GlcNAc, 50 mU/mg GnT-I and<br>
41 mlJ/mg GnT-II. The reaction achieved 97% completion of the addition of the bi-<br>
antennary GlcNAc moiety, with 3% tri-mannosyl core remaining. Figure 148 depicts the<br>
HPLC analysis of the glycans released from EPO after the GnT-I/GnT-II reaction.<br>
GnT-V Reaction. The GnT-V reaction containing 100 mM MES pH 6.5. 5 mM<br>
UDP-GlcNAc, 5 mM MnCI2, 0.02% NaN3, 10 mU/mg GnT-V and 1 mg/mL EPO, was<br>
incubated at 32°C for 24 hours. This reaction adds a GlcNAc moiety to an outer mannose<br>
moiety already containing a GlcNAc moiety. Figure 149 depicts the HPLC analysis of the<br>
glycans released from EPO after the GnT-V reaction. Approximately 92% the glycans<br>
released from EPO were the desired product, tri-antennary branched EPO with terminal<br>
GlcNAc moieties, based on glycan and MALDI analysis. The remaining 8% of the glycans<br>
were bi-antennary branched structures containing terminal GlcNAc moieties.<br>
GalT-1 Reaction. The GalT-1 reaction containing 100 mM Tris pll 7.2. 150 mM<br>
NaCl, 5 mM UDP Gal, 100 mU/mg GalT-1, 5 mM MnCI2, 0.02% NaN3 and 1 mg/mL EPO<br>
was incubated at 32°C for 24 hours. Figure 150 depicts the HPLC analysis of the glycans<br>
released from EPO after this reaction. Glycan and MALDI analysis indicates that 97% of the<br>
released glycans had terminal galactose moieties on the tri-antennary branched structures.<br>
The remaining 3% was a bi-antennary structure containing a terminal galactose.<br>
Supcrdcx 75 Purification. After the GnT-I/GalTI reaction, EPO was purified from<br>
the enzyme protein contaminants and nucleotide sugars using a 1.6 cm x 60 cm Superdex-75<br>
gel filtration chromatography (Amersham Biosciences, Arlington Heights, IL) in PBS<br>
containing 0.02% Tween 20. The purified material was divided into two batches to produce<br>
the tri-antennary glycan with terminal 2.6-SA moieties and the tri-antennary glycan w ith<br>
terminal 2,6-SA moieties capped with 2.6-SA moieties.<br>
ST3Gal3 Reaction. The ST3Gal3 reaction was incubated at 32°C for 24 hours. The<br>
reaction contained 1 mg/mL galactosylated EPO, 100 mM Tris-Cl pH 7.2, 150 mM NaCl,<br>
0.02% NaN3, 50 mU/mg ST3Gal3, and 3 mM CMP-SA. Figure 151 depicts the HPLC<br>
analysis of glycans released from EPO after this step. Based on glycan and MALD1 analysis,<br>
approximately 80% of the released glycans were tri-antennary branched structures with<br>
terminal 2,3-SA moieties. The remaining 20% of the released glycans were bi-antennary<br>
structures with terminal 2.3-SA moieties.<br>
ST6Gall sialylation Reaction following the ST3Gal3 Reaction. The ST6Gall<br>
reaction was incubated at 32°C for 24 hours. The reaction contained 1 mg/mL sialylated<br>
galactosylated EPO. 100 mM Tris-Cl pll 7.2. 150 mM NaCl, 0.02%NaN3. 50 mU/mg<br>
ST6Gall, and 3 mM CMP-SA. Figure 152 depicts the results of HPLC analysis of the<br>
glycans released from EPO after the ST6Gall reaction. Based on glycan and MALD1<br>
analysis, approximately 80% of the tri-antennary branched glycans contained terminal 2,3-SA<br>
moieties. The remaining 20% of the glycans were bi-antennary with terminal 2.3-SA<br>
moieties.<br>
Superdex 75 Purification. EPO was purified from the contaminants of the ST3Gal3<br>
reactions by a 1.6 cm x 60 cm Superdex-75 gel filtration chromatography (Amersham<br>
Biosciences. Arlington Heights, IL) in PBS containing 0.02% Tween-20.<br>
Bioassay of Tri-antennary and Bi-antennary Sialylated or PEGylated EPO. The<br>
activity of the tri-antennary and bi-antennary sialylated EPO glycoforms. and the PEG 10<br>
kDa and 1 kDa bi-antennary glycoforms were assayed using the TF-1 cell line and the MTT<br>
viability test, as described above. Figure 153 depicts the results of the MTT cell proliferation<br>
assay. At 2 |ug/ml EDP. the bi-antennary sialylated EPO had nearly the activity of the control<br>
Epogen, while the tri-antennary sialylated EPO had significanly less activity.<br>
Factor IX<br>
19. GlycoPEGylation of Factor IX produced in CHO cells<br>
This example sets forth the preparation of asialoFactor IX and its sialylation with<br>
CMP-sialic acid-PEG.<br>
Desialylation of rFactor IX. A recombinant form of Coagulation Factor IX (rFactor<br>
IX ) was made in CHO cells. 6000 1U of rFactor IX were dissolved in a total of 12 mL USP<br>
HiO. This solution was transferred to a Centricon Plus 20, PL-10 centrifugal filter with<br>
another 6 mL USP H20. The solution was concentrated to 2 mL and then diluted with 15 mL<br>
50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 0.15 M NaCl, 5 mM CaCI2, 0.05% NaN3 and then reconcentraled.<br>
The dilution/concentration was repeated 4 times to effectively change the buffer to a final<br>
volume of 3.0 mL. Of this solution, 2.9 mL (about 29 mg of rFactor IX) was transferred to a<br>
small plastic tube and to it was added 530 mU a2-3,6,8-Neuraminidase- agarose conjugate<br>
(Vibrio cholerae, Calbiochem, 450 µL). The reaction mixture was rotated gently for 26.5<br>
hours at 32 °C. The mixture was centrifuged 2 minutes at 10,000 rpm and the supernatant<br>
was collected. The agarose beads (containing neuraminidase) were washed 6 times with 0.5<br>
mL 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.12, 1 M NaCl, 0.05% NaN3. The pooled washings and<br>
supernatants were centrifuged again for 2 minutes at 10,000 rpm to remove any residual<br>
agarose resin. The pooled, desialylated protein solution was diluted to 19 mL with the same<br>
buffer and concentrated down to ~ 2 mL in a Centricon Plus 20 PL-10 centrifugal filter. The<br>
solution was twice diluted with 15 mL of 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 0.15 MMaCI. 0.05%<br>
NaN3 and reconcentrated to 2 mL. The final desialyated rFactor IX solution was diluted to 3<br>
mL final volume (-10 mg/mL) with the Tris Buffer. Native and desialylated rFactor IX<br>
samples were analyzed by IEF-Electrophoresis. Isoelectric Focusing Gels (pH 3-7) were run<br>
using 1.5 µL (15 ug) samples first diluted with 10 µL Tris buffer and mixed with 12 µL<br>
sample loading buffer. Gels were loaded, run and fixed using standard procedures. Gels<br>
were stained with Colloidal Blue Stain (Figure 154), showing a band for desialylated Factor<br>
IX.<br>
Preparation of PEG (1 kDa and 10 kDa)-SA-Factor IX. Desialylated rFactor-IX<br>
(29 mg. 3 mL) was divided into two 1.5 mL (14.5 mg) samples in two 15 mL centrifuge<br>
tubes. Each solution was diluted with 12.67 mL 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 0.15 M NaCl,<br>
0.05% NaN3 and either CMP-SA-PEG-1 k or 10k (7.25 µmol) was added. The tubes were<br>
inverted gently to mix and 2.9 U ST3Gal3 ß26 µL) was added (total volume 14.5 mL). The<br>
tubes were inverted again and rotated gently for 65 hours at 32 °C. The reactions were<br>
stopped by freezing at -20 °C. 10 µg samples of the reactions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE.<br>
The PEGylated proteins were purified on a Toso Haas Biosep G3000SW (21.5 x 30 cm. 13<br>
µm) HPLC column with Dulbecco's Phosphate Buffered Saline, pH 7.1 (Gibco), 6 mL/min.<br>

standard conditions (Amersham Biosciences, Arlington Heights, 1L) and formulated in<br>
phosphate buffered saline containing 0.1% BSA. After dilution in phosphate buffer to the<br>
appropriate concentration, each of the test FSH proteins (0.4 ^ig, each) was injected<br>
intraveneously into female Sprague Dawley rats (250-300 g body weight) and blood drawn at<br>
time points from 0 to 80 hours. Radioactivity in blood samples was analyzed using a gamma<br>
counter and the pharmacokinetics analyzed using standard methods (Figure 169). FSH was<br>
cleared from the blood much more quickly than FSH-PEG(1 kDa), which in tµm was clear<br>
somewhat more quickly than FSH-PEG(10 kDa).<br>
26. Sertoli Cell Bioassay for In Vitro Activity of GlycoPEGylated FSH<br>
This example sets forth a bioassay for follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) activity<br>
based on cultured Sertoli cells. This assay is useful to determine the bioactivily of FSHI after<br>
glycan remodeling, including glycoconjugation.<br>
This bioassay is based on the dose-response relationship that exists between the<br>
amount of estradiol produced when FSH, but not lutenizing hormone (EH), is added to<br>
cultured Sertoli cells obtained from immature old rats. Exogenous testosterone is converted<br>
to 17ß-estradiol in the presence of FSH.<br>
Seven to 10 days old Sprague-Dawley rats were used to obtain Sertoli cells. After<br>
sacrifice, testes were decapsulated and tissue was dispersed by incubation in collagenase (1<br>
mg/ml), trypsin (lmg/ml), hyaluronidase (1 mg/ml) and DNases (5 µg/ml) for 5 to 10 min.<br>
The tubule fragments settled to the bottom of the flask and were washed in PBS (1 x). The<br>
tubule fragments were reincubated for 20 min with a media containing the same enzymes:<br>
collagenase (1 mg/ml). trypsin (lmg/ml). hyaluronidase (1 mg/ml) and DNases (5 µg/ml).<br>
The tubule fragments were homogenized and plated into a 24 well plate in a serum<br>
free media. 5x105 cells were dispersed per well. After 48h incubation at 37° C and 5%<br>
CO2. fresh media was added to the cells. Composition of the serum free media: DMEM (1<br>
vol), Ham's F10 nutrient mixture (1 vol), insulin 1 µg/ml. Transferrin 5 µg/ml, EGF 10<br>
ng/ml. T4 20 pg/ml. Hydrocortisone 10-8M, Retinoic acid 10-6M.<br>
The stimulation experiment consists of a 24 hour incubation with standard FSH or<br>
samples at 37°C and 5% C02 The mean intra-assay coefficient of variation is 9% and the<br>
mean inter-assay coefficient of variation is 11%.<br>
The 17B-estradiol Elisa Kit DE2000 (R&amp;D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) was used to<br>
quantify the level of estradiol after incubation with FSH. FSH-SA-PEG (1 kDa) and FSH-<br>
SA-PEG(lOkDa).<br>
The procedure was as follows: 100 µl of Estradiol Standard (provided with kit and<br>
prepared as per instructions with kit) or sample was pipetted into wells of 17B-estradiol Elisa<br>
plate(s); 50 µl of 17B-estradiol Conjugate (provided with kit, prepared as per instructions<br>
with kit) was added to each well; 50 µl of 17B-estradiol antibody solution (provided with kit<br>
and prepared as per instructions with kit) was added to each well; plates were incubated for 2<br>
hour at room temperature at 200 rpm; the liquid was aspirated from each well; the wells were<br>
washed 4 times using the washing solution; all the liquid was removed from the wells; 200 µl<br>
of pNPP Substrate (provided with kit and prepared as per instructions with kit) was added to<br>
all wells and incubated for 45 min; 50 µl of Stop solution (provided with kit and prepared as<br>
per instructions with kit) was added and the plates were read it at 405 nm (Figure 170).<br>
While FSH-PEG( 10 kDa) exhibited a modest stimulation of Sertoli cells, at 1 µg/ml, FSII-<br>
PEG(1 kDa) stimulated Sertoli cells up to 50% more than unPEGylated FSH.<br>
27. Steelman-Pohley Bioassay of In Vivo Activity ot'GlycoPEGvlatcd FSH<br>
In this example, the Steelman-Pohley bioassay (Steelman and Pohley. 1953,<br>
Endocrinology 53:604-615) was used to determine the in vivo activity of glycoPEGylated<br>
FSH. The Steelman-Pohley assay uses the change in ovary weight of a rat to measure the in<br>
vivo activity of FSII that is coinjected with human chorionic gonadotropin.<br>
The Steelman-Pohley bioassay was performed according to the protocol described in<br>
Christin-Maitre et al. (2000, Methods 21:51 -57). Seventy female Sprague-Dawley Rats<br>
(Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, MA), aged 21 to 22 days, were housed in the<br>
testing facility for at least 5 days before the beginning the assay procedure. Throughout the<br>
procedure, the animal room was climate controlled at 18 to 26°C, 30 to 70% relative<br>
humidity, and 12 hr. artificial light/12 hr. dark. All animals were fed Certified Rodent Chow<br>
(Harlan Teklad, Madison WI) or the equivalent, and water, both ad libitum. Animal<br>
procedures were performed at Calvert Preclinical Services, Inc. (Olyphant, PA).<br>
Recombinant FSH was expressed in CHO cells, purified by standard techniques and<br>
glycoPEGylated with PEG (1 kDa). The rats were divided into seven test groups, with ten<br>
animals per group. On days -1 and 0, animals of all groups were subcutaneously injected<br>
with 20 I.U. of human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) in 0.5 ml of 0.9 % NaCl. On days 1, 2<br>
and 3, the control animals were subcutaneously injected with a dose of 0.5 ml containing 20<br>
I.U. HCG in 0.9% NaCl. while in the other groups, the HCG dose was augmented with either<br>
rFSH or rFSH-SA-PEG (1 kDa) at either 0.14 µg, 0.4 µg or 1.2 µg per dose. On day 4, the<br>
animals were euthanized by CO2 inhalation. The ovaries were removed, trimmed and<br>
weighted. The average ovary weight was determined for each group.<br>
Figure 171 presents the average ovary weight of the test groups on day 4. The groups<br>
receiving HCG alone (control) or the low dose (0.14 µg) of either rFSH or rFSH-SA-PEG (1<br>
kDa) had ovary weights that were roughly equivalent. The groups receiving the medium (0.4 µg) or high (1.2 µg) doses of rFSH or rFSH-SA-PEG (1 kDa) had ovary weights roughly<br>
twice that of the control group. At the medium dose (0.4 µg), the glycoPEGylated rFSH had<br>
roughly the same in vivo activity (as determined by ovary weight) as the unPEGylated rFSH.<br>
At the high dose (1.2 µg), the glycoPEGylated rFSH had somewhat higher in vivo activity<br>
than the unPEGylated rFSH.<br>

GlcNAc-Asn structures.<br>
Recombinant GM-CSF expressed in yeast is expected to contain 2 N-linked and 2 O-<br>
linked glycans. The N-linked glycans should be of the branched mannan type. This<br>
recombinant glycoprotein is treated with an endoglycosidase from the group consisting of<br>
endoglycosidase H. endoglycosidase-Fl, endoglycosidase-F2, endoglycosidase-F3,<br>

2.5 mg/mL in 50 mM Tris-HCl, 0.15 M NaCl, 5 mM MnCl2, 0.05% NaN3, pH 7.2. The<br>
solution is incubated with I mM UDP-galactose-linker-mithramycin and 0.1 U/mL of<br>

Interferon a and Interferon ß<br>
33. GlycoPEGylation of Proteins expressed in Mammalian or Insect Systems:<br>
EPO, Interferon a and Interferon ß<br>
This example sets forth the preparation of PEGylated peptides that are expressed in<br>
mammalian and insect systems.<br>
Preparation of acceptor from mammalian expression systems. The peptides to be<br>
glycoPEGylated using CMP-sialic acid PEG need to have glycans terminating in galactose.<br>
Most peptides from mammalian expression systems will have terminal sialic acid that first<br>
needs to be removed.<br>
Sialidase digestion. The peptide is desialylated using a sialidase. A typical<br>
procedure involves incubating a 1 mg/mL solution of the peptide in Tris-buffered saline. pH<br>
7.2. with 5 mM CaCl2 added, with 0.2 U/mL immobilized sialidase from Vibrio cholera<br>
(Calbiochem) at 32°C for 24 hours. Microbial growth can be halted either by sterile filtration<br>
or the inclusion of 0.02% sodium azidc. The resin is then removed by centrifugation or<br>
filtration, and then washed to recover entrapped peptide. At this point, EDTA may be added<br>
to the solution to inhibit any sialidase that has leached from the resin.<br>
Preparation from insect expression systems. EPO, interferon-alpha, and<br>
inlerferon-beta may also be expressed in non-mammalian systems such as yeast, plants, or<br>
insect cells. The peptides to be glycoPEGylated using CMP-sialic acid PEG need to have<br>
glycans terminating in galactose. The majority of the N-glycans on peptides expressed in<br>
insect cells, for example, are the trimannosyl core. These glycans are first built out to<br>
glycans terminating in galactose before they are acceptors for sialyltransferase.<br>
Building acceptor glycans from trimannosyl core. Peptide (1 mg/mL) in Tris-<br>
buffered saline, pH 7.2, containing 5 mM MnCl2, 5 mM UDP-glcNAc, 0.05 U/mL<br>
GLCNACT I, 0.05 U/mL GLCNACT II, is incubated at 32°C for 24 hours or until the<br>
reaction is substantially complete. Microbial growth can be halted either by sterile filtration<br>
or the inclusion of 0.02% sodium azide. After buffer exchange to remove UDP and other<br>
small molecules,, UDP-galactose and MnCl2 are each added to 5 mM, galactosyltransferase is<br>
added to 0.05 U/mL, and is incubated at 32°C for 24H or until the reaction is substantially<br>
complete. Microbial growth can be halted either by sterile filtration or the inclusion of 0.02%<br>
sodium azide. The peptides are then ready for glycoPEGylation.<br>
Building O-linked glycans. A similar strategy may be employed for interferon alpha<br>
to produce enzymatically the desired O-glycan Gal-GalNAc. If necessary, GalNAc linked to<br>
serine or threonine can be added to the peptide using appropriate peptide GalNAc<br>
transferases (e.g. GalNAc Tl, GalNAc T2, T3, T4, etc.) and UDP-GalNAc. Also, if needed,<br>
galactose can be added using galactosytransferase and UDP-galactose.<br>
GlycoPEGylation using sialyltransferase. The glycopeptides (1 mg/mL) bearing<br>
terminal galactose in Iris buffered saline + 0.02% sodium azide are incubated with CMP-SA-<br>
PEG (0.75 mM) and 0.4 U/mL sialyltransferase (ST3Gal3 or ST3Gal4 for N-glycans on KPO<br>
and interferon beta: ST3Gal4, or ST3Gall for O-glycans on interferon alpha) at 32°C for 24<br>
hours. Other transferases that may work include the 2,6 sialyltransferase from<br>
Photobacterium damsella. The acceptor peptide concentration is most preferably in the range<br>
of 0.1 mg/mL up to the solubility limit of the peptide. The concentration of CMP-SA-PEG<br>
should be sufficient for there to be excess over the available sites, but not so high as to cause<br>
peptide solubility problems due to the PEG, and may range from 50 µM up to 5 mM, and the<br>
temperature may range from 2°C up to 40°C. The time required for complete reaction will<br>
depend on the temperature, the relative amounts of enzyme to acceptor substrate, the donor<br>
substrate concentration, and the pH.<br>

incubated with 300 mU/mL Neuraminidase II {Vibrio cholerae) for 16 hours at 32 °C. To<br>

kDa)<br>
This example illustrates a procedure PEGylate Interferon-p with either PEG (10 kDa)<br>
or PEG (20 kDa).<br>
Briefly. Interferon-ß-la (INF-P) was obtained from Biogen (Avonex™). The 1FN-P<br>
was first purified by Superdex-75 chromatography. The IFN-ß was then desialylated with<br>
Vibrio cholerae sialidase. The INF-P was then PEGylated with SA-PEG (10 kDa) or SA-<br>
PEG (20 kDa) and purified with Superdex-200 chromatography.<br>
Superdcx-75 chromatography purification. INF-P (150 µg) was applied to a<br>
Supcrdcx-75 column (Amersham Biosciences, Arlington Heights. IL) and eluted with PBS<br>
with 0.5 M NaCl. 0.02 Tween-20, 20 mM histidine and 10% glycerol. The eluant was<br>
monitored for absorbance at 280 nm (Figure 172A and 172B) and fractions were collected.<br>
Peaks 4 and 5 were pooled, concentrated in an Amicon Ultra 15 spin filter (Millipore,<br>
Billerica, MA), and the buffer was exchanged to TBS with 5 mM CaCI2, 0.02% Tween-20,<br>
20 mM histidine and 10% glycerol.<br>
Sialidase Reaction. The INF-ß was then desialydated with Vibrio cholera salidase<br>
(70 mil/ml. CALBIOCHEM®, EMD Biosciences. Inc.. San Diego. CA) on agarose in TBS<br>
with 5 mM CaCl2, 0.02% Tween-20, 20 mM histidine and 10% glycerol. The reaction was<br>
carried out at 32°C for 18 hours. The INF-ß was removed from the agarose with a 0.22 µL<br>
Spin-X™ filter (Corning Technology, Inc., Norcross, GA). Figure 173A depicts the MALD1<br>
analysis of glycans released from native INF-ß. The native 1NF-ß has many glycoforms<br>
containing terminal sialic acid moieties. Figure 173B depicts the MALD1 analysis of glycans<br>
released from desialylated INF-ß. The desialylated INF-ß has primarily one glycoform<br>
which is bi-antennary with terminal galactose moieties.<br>
Lectin Dot-Blot Analysis of Sialylation. Samples of the INF-ß from the desialidase<br>
reaction were dot-blotted onto nitrocellulose and then blocked with Tris buffered saline<br>
(TBS: 0.05M Tris. 0.15M NaCl, pH 7.5) and DIG kit (glycan differentiation kit available<br>
from Roche'#l 210 238) blocking buffer. Some of the blots were incubated with Mauckiu<br>
amurensis agglutinin (MAA) labeled with digoxogenin (DIG) (Roche Applied Science.<br>
Indianapolis, IL) to detect ot2,3-sialylation of INF-ß. These blots were washed with TBS<br>
then incubated with anti-digitonin antibody labeled with alkaline phosphatase, then washed<br>
again with TBS and developed withNBT/X-phosphate solution, wherein NBT is 4-nitro blue<br>
tetrazolium chloride and X-phosphate is 5-bromo-4-chloro—3indoyl phosphate. The left side<br>
of Figure 174 depicts the results of the MAA blot of INF-ß after the desialylation reaction.<br>
The INF-ß is partially disialylatcd, as indicated by the decrease in dot development as<br>
compared to native INF-ß in the desialylated samples.<br>
Other blots were incubated with Erthrina cristagalli lectin (ECL) labeled with biotin<br>
(Vector Laboratories. Burlingame, CA) to detect exposed galactose residues on INF-ß. After<br>
incubation with 2.5 µg/ml ECL, the blots were washed in TBS and incubated with<br>
streptavidin labeled with alkaline phosphatase. The blots were then washed again and<br>
developed. The right side of Figure 174 depicts the ECL blot after development. The<br>
increased intensity of the dot of desialylated INF-ß as compared to the native INF-ß indicate<br>
more exposed galactose moieties and therefore extensive desialylation.<br>

(0.05 mg/ml) was PEGylated with ST3Gal3 (50 mlJ/ml) and CMP-SA-PEG (10 kDa) (250<br>
 µM) in an appropriate buffer of TBS + 5 mM CaCI2, 0.02% Tween 20, 20 mM histidine. 10%<br>
glycerol for 50 hours at 32°C. Figure 175 depicts the SDS-PAGE analysis of the reaction<br>
products showing PEGylated INF-ß at approximately 98 kDa.<br>

(0.5 mg/ml) was PHGylated with ST3Gal3 (170 mU/ml) and CMP-SA-PEG (20 kDa) in an<br>
appropriate buffer of TBS + 5 mM CaCI2, 0.02% Tween 20, 20 mM histidine, 10% glycerol<br>
for 50 hours at 32°C. Figure 176 depicts the SDS-PAGE analysis the products of the<br>
PEGylation reaction. The PEGylated INF-ß has many higher molecular weight bands not<br>
found in the unmodified INF-ß indicating extensive PEGylation.<br>
Superdex-200 Purification of INF-ß PEGylated with PEG (10 kDa). The products<br>
of the PEGylation reaction were separated on a Superdex-200 column (Amersham<br>
Biosciences, Arlington Heights. IL) in PBS with 0.5 NaCl, 0.02 Tween-20, 20 mM histidine<br>
and 10% glycerol at Iml/min and 30 cm/hr flow. The eluant was monitored for absorbance at<br>
280 nm (Figure 177) and fractions were collected. Peaks 3 and 4 were pooled and<br>
concentrated in an Amicon Ultra 15 spin filter.<br>

mM histidine and 10% glycerol at 1 ml/min flow. The eluant was monitored for absorbance<br>
at 280 nm (Figure 179) and fractions were collected. Peak 3 contained most of the INF-ß<br>
PEGylated with PEG (20 kDa).<br><br>
RemicadeTM<br>
36. GIvcoPEGylation of Remicade™ antibody<br>
This example sets forth the procedure to glycoPEGylate a recombinant antibody<br>
molecule by introducing PEG molecules to the Fc region glycans. Here Remicade™. a TNF-<br>
R:lgG Fc region fusion protein, is the exemplary peptide.<br>
Preparation of Remicade™-Gal-PEG (10 kDa). Remicade™ is dissolved at 2.5<br>
mg/mL in 50 mM Tris-HCl, 0.15 M NaCl, 5 mM MnCI2, 0.05% NaN3, pH 7.2. The solution<br>
is incubated with 1 mM UDP-galactose-PEG (10 kDa) and 0.1 U/mL of galactosyltransferase<br>
at 32°C for 2 days to introduce the PEG in the Fc region glycans. To monitor the<br>
incorporation of galactose, a small aliquot of the reaction has 14C-galactose-UDP ligand<br>
added: the label incorporated into the peptide is separated from the free label by gel filtration<br>
on a Toso Haas G3000SW analytical column using PBS buffer (pH 7.1). The radioactive<br>
label incorporation into the peptide is quantitated using an in-line radiation detector.<br>
When the reaction is complete, the reaction mixture is purified using a Toso Haas<br>
TSK-Gel-3000 preparative column using PBS buffer (pH 7.1) and collecting fractions based<br>
on UV absorption. The fractions containing product are combined, concentrated, buffer<br>
exchanged and then freeze-dried. The product of the reaction is analyzed using SDS-PAGH<br>
and 1LT analysis according to the procedures and reagents supplied by Invitrogen. Samples<br>
are dialyzed against water and analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS.<br>
Rituxan™<br>
37. Glycoconjugation of geldanamycin to Rituxan™<br>
This example sets forth the glycoconjugation of a small molecule, such as<br>
geldanamycin, to the Fc region glycans of an antibody produced in CHO cells, such as<br>
Rituxan™. Here, the antibody Rituxan™ is used, but one of skill in the art will appreciate<br>
that the method can be used with many other antibodies.<br>
Preparation of Rituxan™-Gal-linker-geldanamycin. Rituxan™ is dissolved at 2.5<br>
mg/mL in 50 mM Tris-HCl, 0.15 M NaCl, 5 mM MnCl2, 0.05% NaN3, pH 7.2. The solution<br>
is incubated with 1 mM UDP-galactose-linker-geldanamycin and 0.1 U/mL of<br>
galactosyltransferase at 32°C for 2 days to introduce the geldanamycin in the Fc region<br>
glycans. To monitor the incorporation of galactose, a small aliquot of the reaction has 14C-<br>
galactose-UDP ligand added; the label incorporated into the peptide is separated from the free<br>
label by gel filtration on a Toso Haas G3000SW analytical column using PBS buffer (pH<br>
7.1). The radioactive label incorporation into the peptide is quantitated using an in-line<br>
radiation detector.<br>
When the reaction is complete, the reaction mixture is purified using a Toso Haas<br>
TSK-Gel-3000 preparative column using PBS buffer (pH 7.1) and collecting fractions based<br>
on UV absorption. The fractions containing product are combined, concentrated, buffer<br>
exchanged and then freeze-dried. The product of the reaction is analyzed using SDS-PAGE<br>
and IEF analysis according to the procedures and reagents supplied by Invitrogen. Samples<br>
arc dialyzed against water and analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS.<br>
Rnase<br>
38. Remodeling high mannose N-glycans to hybrid and complex N-glycans:<br>
Bovine pancreatic RNase<br>
This example sets forth the preparation of bovine pancreas RNase with hybrid or<br>
complex N-glycans. The high mannose N-linked glycans of the RNase are enzymatically<br>
digested and elaborated to create hybrid N-linked glycans. Additionally, the high mannose<br>
N-linked glycans of the RNase are enzymatically digested and elaborated to create complex<br>
N-linked glycans.<br>
High mannose structures of AM inked oligosaccharides in glycopeptides can be<br>
modified to hybrid or complex forms using the combination of a-mannosidases and<br>
glycosyltransferases. This example summarizes the results in such efforts using a simple N-<br>
Glycan as a model substrate.<br>
Ribonuclease B (RNaseB) purified from bovine pancreas (Sigma) is a glycopeptide<br>
consisting of 124 amino acid residues. It has a single potential N-glycosylation site modified<br>
with high mannose structures. Due to its simplicity and low molecular weight (13.7 kDa to<br>
15.5 kDa). ribonuclease B is a good candidate to demonstrate the feasibility of the Ar-Glycan<br>
remodeling from high mannose structures to hybrid or complex N-linked oligosaccharides.<br>
The MALDI-TOF spectrum of RNaseB (Figure 180A) and HPLC profile for the<br>
oligosaccharides cleaved from RNaseB by N-Glycanase (Figure 180B) indicated that, other<br>
than a small portion of the non-modified peptide, the majority of N-glycosylation sites of the<br>
peptide are modified with high mannose oligosaccharides consisting of 5 to 9 mannose<br>
residues.<br>
Conversion of high mannose N-Glycans to hybrid N-Glycans. High mannose A -<br>
Glycans were converted to hybrid N-Glycans using the combination of a1,2-mannosidase.<br>
GlcNAcT-l (P-l,2-A'-acetyl glucosaminyl transferase), GalT-I (ßl,4-galactosyltransfease) and<br>
(x2,3-sialyltransferasc /or a2,6-sialyltransferase as shown in Figure 181.<br>
As an example, high mannose structures in RNaseB were successfully converted to<br>
hybrid structures.<br>
Man5GlcNAc:-R was obtained from Man5.9GlcNAc2-R catalyzed by a single al.2-<br>
mannosidase cloned from Trichoderma reesei (Figure 182). RNase B (1 g. about 67 µmol)<br>
was incubated at 30°C for 45 hr with 15 mU of the recombinant T. reesei a1,2-mannosidase<br>
in MliS buffer (50 mM, pH 6.5) in a total volume of 10 mL. Man6..)GlcNAc2-protein<br>
structures have been successfully converted to Man5GIcNAc2-protein with high efficiency by<br>
the recombinant mannosidase.<br>
Alternately. Man5GlcNAc2-R was obtained from Man5.9GlcNAc2-R catalyzed by a<br>
single a1,2-mannosidase purified from Aspergillus saitoi (Figure 183). RNasc B (40 µg.<br>
about 2.7 nmol) was incubated at 37°C for 42.5 hr with 25 µU of the commercial A. saitoi a1,2-mannosidase (Glyko or CalBioChem) in NaOAC buffer (100 mM, pH 5.0) in a total<br>
volume of 20 µl. Man(,.gGlcNAc2-protein structures were successfully converted to<br>
MansGlcNAc2-protein by the commercially available mannosidase. However, a new peak<br>
corresponding to the GlcNAc-protein appears in the spectrum, indicating the possible<br>
contamination of endoglycosidase H in the preparation. Although several mammalian alpha-<br>
mannosidases were required to achieve this step, the fungal a1,2-mannosidase was very<br>
efficient to remove all a1,2-linked mannose residues.<br>
GlcNAcT-I then added a GlcNAc residue to the MansGlcNAc2-R (Figure 184). The<br>
reaction mixture after the T. reesei a1,2-mannosidase reaction containing RNase B (600 µg.<br>
about 40 nmol) was incubated with non-purified recombinant GlcNAcT-l ß4 mil) in MES<br>
buffer (50 mM. pH 6.5) containing MnCl2 (20 mM) and UDP-GlcNAc (5 mM) in a total<br>
volume of 400 µl. at 37°C for 42 hr. A GlcNAc residue was quantitatively added to<br>
MansGlcNAcrprotein by the recombinant GlcNAcT-I.<br>
A Gal residue was then added using GalT 1 (Figure 185). The reaction mixture after<br>
the Gn 1-1 reaction containing RNase B (120 µg, about 8 nmol) was incubated at 37°C for 20<br>
hr with 3.3 mU of the recombinant GalT-1 in Tris-HCl buffer (100 mM, pH 7.3) containing<br>
UDP-Gal (7.5 mM) and MnCl2 (20 mM) in a total volume of 100 µl. A Gal residue was<br>
added to about 98% of the GlcNAc-Man5GlcNAc2-protein by the recombinant GalT 1.<br>
The next step was the addition of a sialic acid using an a2,3-sialyltransferase or an<br>
a2.6-sialyltransferasc (Figure 186). As an example, ST3Gal 111, an a2,3-sialyltransferase was<br>
used. The reaction mixture after the GalT-1 reaction containing RNase B (13 ( µg, about 0.87<br>
nmol) was incubated at 37°C for 16 hr with 8.9 mil of recombinant ST3Gal III in Tris-HCl<br>
buffer (100 mM, pH 7.3) containing CMP-Sialic acid (5 mM) and MnCl2 (20 mM) in a total<br>
volume of 20 µl. A sialic acid residue was added to about 90% of the Gal-GlcNAc-<br>
Man5GlcNAc2-protein by recombinant ST3Gal III using CMP-SA as the donor. The yield<br>
can be further improved by adjusting the reaction conditions.<br>
For convenience, no purification or dialysis step was required after each reaction<br>
described above. More interesting. GalT 1 and ST3Gal III can be combined in a one-pot<br>
reaction. Similar yields were obtained as compared with the separate reactions. The reaction<br>
mixture after the GlcNAcT-l reaction containing RNase B (60 µg, about 4 nmol) was<br>
incubated at 37°C for 20 hr with 1.7 mlJ of recombinant GalT 1. 9.8 mU of recombinant<br>
ST3Gal III in Tris-HCl buffer (100 mM, pH 7.3) containing UDP-Gal (7.5 mM), CMP-sialic<br>
acid (5 mM) and MnCl2 (20 mM) in a total volume of 60 µl.<br>
As shown in Figure 187, SA-PEG (10 kDa) was successfully added to the RNaseB.<br>
The reaction mixture after the GalT-1 reaction containing RNase B (6.7 µg. about 0.45 nmol)<br>
was dialyzed against H20 for 1 hour at room temperature and incubated at 37°C for 15.5<br>
hours with 55 mU of the recombinant ST3Gal III in Tris-HCl buffer (50 mM, pH 7.3)<br>
containing CMP-SA-PBG (10 kDa) (0.25 mM) and MnCl2 (20 mM) in a total volume of 20<br>
µl. PEG-modified sialic acid residues were successfully added to the Gal-GlcNAc-<br>
Man.sGlcNAc2-peplide by the recombinant S'DGal III. The yield can be further improved by<br>
adjusting the reaction conditions.<br>
Conversion of high mannose N-Glycans to complex N-Glycans. To achieve this<br>
conversion, a GlcNAcß1,2Man3GlcNAc2-peptide intermediate is obtained. As shown in<br>
Figure 188, there are at least four feasible routes to carry out the reaction from<br>
Man-iGlcNAc2-peptide to this intermediate:<br>
Route I: The Man5GlcNAc2-peptide produced by the fungal a1,2 mannosidase is a<br>
substrate of GlcNAc transferase I (GlcNAcT-I, enzyme 2) which adds one GlcNAc. The<br>
terminal al,3- and a1,6-linked mannose residues of GlcNAcMan5GlcNAc2-peptide is<br>
removed by Golgi a-mannosidase II (Manll, enzyme 5). This route is a part of the natural<br>
pathway for the processing of N-linked oligosaccharides carried out in higher organisms.<br>
Route II: Two mannose residues are first removed by an a-mannosidase (enzyme 6),<br>
then a GlcNAc is added by GlcNAcT-I (enzyme 2). Other than its natural acceptor<br>
Man5GlcNAc2-R, GlcNAcT-I can also recognize Man3GlcNAc2-R as its substrate and add<br>
one GlcNAc to the mannose core structure to form GlcNAcMan3GlcNAc2-peplide.<br>
Route III: The al,6-linked mannose is removed by an al,6-mannosidase, followed<br>
by the addition of GlcNAc by GlcNAcT-I and removal of the terminal al,3-linked mannose<br>
by an a1,3-mannosidase. From the experimental data obtained, GlcNAcT-I can recognize<br>
this ManiGlcNAc2-peptide as acceptor and add one GlcNAc residue to form<br>
GlcNAcMan4GlcNAc2-peptide.<br>
Route IV: Similar to Route III, a1,3-linked mannose is removed by an al,3-<br>
mannosidase, followed by GlcNAcT-I reaction. Then the terminal a1,6-linked mannose can<br>
be removed by an a1,6-mannosidase.<br>
After the function of GlcNAcT-I (responsible for the addition of the GlcNAc ß1.2-<br>
linked to the a1,3-mannose on the mannose core) and GIcNAcT-II (responsible for the<br>
addition of a second GlcNAc ß1,2-linked to the al,6-mannose on the mannose core), the<br>
GlcNAc2Man3GlcNAc2-peptide can be processed by GalT 1 and sialyltransferase to form bi-<br>
antennary complex N- Glycans. Other GlcNAc transferases such as GlcNAcT-IV, GlcNAcT-<br>
V. and/or GlcNAcT-VI (Figure 188 and Figure 189) can also glycosylate the<br>
GlcNAc2Man-,GlcNAc2-peptide. Additional glycosylation by the GalT 1 and<br>
sialyltransferases will form multi-antennary complex N-glycans. The enzyme GlcNAcT-lII<br>
catalyzes the insertion of a bisecting GlcNAc, thus preventing the actions of Manll and<br>
subsequent action of transferases GlcNAcT-II, GlcNAcT-IV and GlcNAcT-V.<br>
Tissue-Type Plasminogen Activator (TPA)<br>
39. Fucosvlation of TPA to create Sialyl Lewis X<br>
This example sets forth the preparation of Tissue Tissue-type Plasminogen Activator<br>
(TPA) with N-linkcd sialyl Lewis X antigen.<br>
Sialylation. TPA expressed in mammalian cells will often contain a majority of the<br>
glycans terminating in sialic acid, but to ensure complete sialylation, it would be beneficial to<br>
first perform an in vitro sialylation. TPA in a suitable buffer (most preferably between pH<br>
5.5 and 9, for example Tris buffered saline, pH 7.2) is incubated with CMP sialic acid and<br>
sialyltransferase for a time sufficient to convert any glycans lacking sialic acid to sialylated<br>
species. Typical conditions would be I mg/mL TPA, 3 mM CMP sialic acid. 0.02 U/mL<br>
ST3Gal3, 32°C for 24 hours. Microbial growth can be halted either by sterile filtration or the<br>
inclusion of 0.02% sodium azide. The TPA concentration is most preferably in the range 0.1<br>
mg/mL up to the solubility limit of the peptide. The concentration of CMP-SA should be<br>
sufficient for there to be excess over the available sites, and might range from 50 µM up to 50<br>
mM. and the temperature from 2°C up to 40°C. The time required for complete reaction will<br>
depend on the temperature, the relative amounts of enzyme to acceptor substrate, the donor<br>
substrate concentration, and the pH. Other sialyltransferases that may be capable of adding<br>
sialic acid in 2,3 linkage include ST3Gal4; microbial transferases could also be used.<br>
Fucosylation. Typical conditions for fucosylation would be 1 mg/mL TPA. 3 mM<br>
GDP-fucose. 0.02 U/mL FTVI, 5 mM MnCl2, 32°C for 24H in Tris buffered saline.<br>
Microbial growth can be halted either by sterile filtration or the inclusion of 0.02% sodium<br>
azide. The TPA concentration is most preferably in the range 0.1 mg/mL up to the solubility<br>
limit of the peptide. The concentration of GDP-fucose should be sufficient for there to be<br>
excess over the available sites, and might range from 50 µM up to 50 mM, and the<br>
temperature from 2°C up to 40°C. The time required for complete reaction will depend on<br>
the temperature, the relative amounts of enzyme to acceptor substrate, the donor substrate<br>
concentration, and the pH. Other fucosyltransferases that may be capable of making sialyl<br>
Lewis x include FTVII, FTV, FTIII, as well as microbial transferases could also be used.<br>
40. Trimming of high mannose to tri-mannose core structure: Tissue-type<br>
Plasminogen Activator produced in CHO<br>
This example sets forth the preparation of Tissue-type Plasminogen Activator with a<br>
trimannose core by trimming back from a high mannose glycan.<br>
Tissue-type plasminogen activator (TPA) is currently produced in Chinese Hamster<br>
Ovary (CHO) cells and contains a low amount of high mannose N-linked oligosaccharide.<br>
The mannoses can be trimmed down using a variety of the specific mannosidascs. The first<br>
step is to generate Man5GlcNAc2(Fuc0-l) from Man9GlcNAc2(Fuc0-l). This can be done<br>
using mannosidasc 1. Then either GlcNAcTl (GlcNAc transferase I) is used to make<br>
GlcNAclMan5GlcNAc2(Fuc0-l) or Mannosidase III is used to make Man3GlcNAc2(FucO-<br>
1). From Man3GlcNAc2(FucO-l), GlcNAclMan3GlcNAc2(Fuc0-l) can be produced using<br>
GlcNAcTl or from GlcNAclMan5GlcNAc2(Fuc0-1), GlcNAclMan3GlcNAc2(Fuc0-1) can<br>
be produced using Mannosidase II. GlcNAc I Man3GlcNAc2(Fuc0-l) is then converted into<br>
GlcNAc2Man3GlcNAc2(FucO-l) using GlcNAcTransfcrase II (GlcNAcTIl). Ihe two<br>
terminal GlcNAc residues are then galactosylated using GalTI and then sialylated with SA-<br>
PkG using ST3GalIII.<br>
Conversely. TPA can be produce in yeast or fungal systems. Similar processing<br>
would be required for fungal derived material.<br>
41. Generation and PEGylation of GlcNAc-ASN structures: TPA produced in<br>
Yeast<br>
This example sets forth the preparation of PEGylated GlcNAc-Asn structures on a<br>
peptide such as TPA expressed in yeast.<br>
Yeast expression is expected to result in a TPA which contains a single N-linked<br>
mannan-type structure. This recombinant glycoprotein is first treated with endoglycosidasc<br>
11 to generate GlcNAc structures on the asparagine (Asn) residues on the peptide.<br>
The GlcNAc-Asn structures on the peptide/protein backbone are then be modified<br>
with galactose or galactose-PEG using UDP-galactose or UDP-galactose-6-PEG.<br>
respectively, and a galactosyltransferase such as GalTI. In one case, the galactose-PEG is<br>
the terminal residue. In the second case, the galactose is further modified with SA-PEG<br>
using a CMP-SA-PEG donor and a sialyltransferase such as ST3GalIII. In another<br>
embodiment, the GlcNAc-Asn structures on the peptide/protein backbone may be<br>
galactosylated and sialylated as described above, and then further sialylated using CMP-SA-<br>
PEG and an a2,8-sialyltransferase such as the enzyme encoded by the Campylobacter jejuni<br>
cst-ll gene.<br>
Transferrin<br>
42. GlycoPEGylation of Transferrin<br>
This example sets forth the preparation of asialotransferrin and its sialylation with<br>
PEG-CMP-sialic acid.<br>
Preparation of Asialo-transferrin. Human-derived holo-Transferrin. (10 mg) was<br>
dissolved in 500 µL of 50 mM NaOAc, 5 mM CaCl2, pH 5.5. To this solution was added<br>
500 mU Neuraminidase II {Vibrio cholerae) and the reaction mixture was shaken gently for<br>
20.5 hours at 37 °C. The reaction mixture was added to the prewashed N-(p-<br>
aminophenyl)oxamic acid-agarose conjugate (600 µL) and the washed beads gently rotated<br>
for 24 hours at 4 °C. The mixture was centrifuged at 10.000 rpm and the supernatant was<br>
collected. The reaction mixture was adjusted to 5 mM EDTA by addition of 100 µL of 30<br>
mM EDTA to the washed beads, which were gently rotated for 20 hours at 4 °C. The<br>
suspension was centrifuged for 2 minutes at 10,000 rpm and the supernatant was collected.<br>
The beads were washed 5 times with 0.35 mL of 50 mM NaOAc, 5 mM CaCl2, 5 mM<br>
EDTA, pH 5.5 and all supernatants were pooled. The enzyme solution was dialyzcd twice at<br>
4 ºC into 15 mM Tris-HCl, 1 M NaCl, pH 7.4. 0.3 mL of the transferrin solution )(3.3 mL<br>
total) was removed and dialyzed twice against water. The remainder was dialyzed twice<br>
more at 4 °C against phosphate buffered saline. The dialyzed solution was stored at -20 " C.<br>
Protein samples were analyzed by 1EF Electrophoresis. Samples (9 µL, 25 µg) were diluted<br>
with 16 µL Tris buffer and mixed with 25 µL of the sample loading buffer and applied to<br>
Isoelectric Focusing Gels (pH 3-7). Gels were run and fixed using standard procedures. Gels<br>
were stained with Colloidal Blue Stain.<br>
Sialyl-PEGylation of asialo-Transferrin. Desialylated transferrin (250 µg) and<br>
CMP-sialic acid or CMP-SA-PEG (1 kDa or 10 kDa)(0.05 µmol) were dissolved in 69 µL 50<br>
mM Tris-HCl, 0.15 M NaCl, 0.05% NaN3. pH 7.2 in 1.5 mL plastic tubes. The tubes were<br>
vortexed briefly and 100 mU ST3Gal3 (90 u. L) were added (total volume 250 u L). The<br>
tubes were vortexed again and mixed gently for 24 hours at 32 °C. The reactions were<br>
stopped by freezing at -80 °C. Novex Tris-Glycine 8-16% 1 mm gels were used for SDS<br>
PAGE analysis (Figure 190). Samples (25 µL, 25 µg) were mixed with 25 µL of sample<br>
loading buffer and 0.4 µL of P-mercaptoethanol and heated for 6 minutes at 85 °C. Gels<br>
were run using standard conditions and stained with Colloidal Blue Stain. 1EF gels were also<br>
performed as described above Figure 191). Samples were also dialyzed against water<br>
analyzed by MALDI-TOF.<br>

43. Transferrin-GDNF<br>
this example sets forth the procedures for the glycoconjugation of proteins, and in<br>
particular, transferrin is glycoconjugated to GDNF. Transferrin-SA-Linker-Gal-UDP is<br>
prepared from transferrin. The galactose residue is removed from GNDF glycans, and<br>
Transferrin-SA-Linker-Gal-UDP is conjugated to GNDF glycans using a<br>
galactosyltransferasc.<br>
Preparation of agalacto-GDNF. GDNF produced in NSO cells (NSO murine<br>
myeloma cells) is dissolved at 2.5 mg/mL in 50 mM Tris 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4. 0.15 M<br>
NaCl, and is incubated with 300 mU/mL beta-galactosidase-agarose conjugate for 16 hours at<br>
32°C. To monitor the reaction a small aliquot of the reaction is diluted with the appropriate<br>
buffer and a IEF gel performed according to Invitrogen procedures. The mixture is<br>
centrifuged at 10.000 rpm and the supernatant is collected. The supernatant is dialyzed at 4<br>

2.5 mg/mL in 50 mM Tris-HCl, 0.15 M NaCl. 0.05% NaN3. pH 7.2. The solution is<br>
incubated with CMP-sialic acid-linker-Gal-UDP (molar amount to add 1 molar equivalent of<br>
nucleotide sugar to transferrin) and 0.1 U/mL of ST3Gal3 at 32°C for 2 days. To monitor the<br>
incorporation of sialic acid, a small aliquot of the reaction has l4C-SA-UDP ligand added; the<br>
label incorporated into the peptide is separated from the free label by gel nitration on a Toso<br>
Haas G3000SW analytical column using PBS buffer (pH 7.1). The radioactive label<br>
incorporation into the peptide is quantitated using an in-line radiation detector.<br>
The solution is incubated with 5 mM CMP-sialic acid and 0.1 U/mL of ST3Gal3 (to<br>
cap any unreacted transferrin glycans) at 32°C for 2 days. The incorporation into the peptide<br>
is quantitated using an in-line UV detector. After 2 days, the reaction mixture is purified<br>
using a Toso Haas G3000SW preparative column using PBS buffer (pH 7.1) and collecting<br>
fractions based on UV absorption. The product of the reaction is analyzed using SDS-PAGL<br>
