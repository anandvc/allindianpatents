SOLVENT-BASED NON-FLUORESCENT INKS FOR WRITING INSTRUMENTS BASED UPON PIGMENT DISPERSIONS IN NON-AQUEOUS SOLVENTS<br>
FIELD OF INVENTION The present invention relates to non-fluorescent ink compositions for writing instruments and writing instruments making use of the ink composition. The ink compositions comprise a non-fluorescent pigment dispersed in a resin, a stabilizer and a high boiling point organic solvent.<br>
BACKGROUND OF INVENTION Current non-aqueous writing instrument inks are in the great majority homogeneous in nature; that is, the colorant is soluble in the liquid medium of the ink. Heterogeneous non-aqueous writing instrument inks currently exist but constitute a very small portion of the total non-aqueous writing instrument market and are limited to a very narrow range of colors such as black, blue, red and green. Those skilled in the art of Formulating writing instrument inks desire a way to extend the range of colorant possibilities into metallic, photochromic, themiochromic, pearlescent, inorganic, organic, luminescent and others. Many, if not all, of these desired colorants are insoluble in currently used solvents. There exists a need to make stable, non-aqueous dispersions of the broad range of possible insoluble colorants and to formulate these dispersions into inks suitable for writing instruments.<br>

The manufacture of lithographic printing inks is distinct from that of handwriting iks. For lithographic printing inks, one objective is for the ink to dry as soon as the ink s printed. For instance, ink chemists normally wish the ink to dry or cure as quickly as ossible so that the printed article may be handled and bound (as in a magazine or book) without the ink's rubbing or smearing off the printed sheet. Accordingly, additives are dded to polymerize the alkyd resin or to react with air (e.g. using metal driers such as obalt, manganese, lead napthenates put into the ink) after the ink is printed. This is listinct from the objective in handwriting inks which is to keep the ink from drying so hat it lasts in the writing instrument The present invention addresses this need.<br>
There is a need for a writing instrument ink that contains many different types of nsoluble colorants. This invention overcomes the problems associated with dispersing hese colorants and stabilizing, against polymerization, the resin used to disperse these colorants so that a usable writing ink can be made which is deliverable using conventional writing instruments.<br>
SUMMARY OF INVENTION<br>
The ink of the present invention discloses heterogeneous non-aqueous, non-fluorescent ink that can be used in conventional writing instruments. In particular, the ink contains a wide and varied range of insoluble colorants dispersed in a resin. More particularly, the resin used to disperse these colorants is an alkyd. Even more particularly, this resin/colorant dispersion when used in the ink is stabilised against curing or polymerization by using antioxidants.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, a non-fluorescent ink composition for a writing instrument comprises a non-fluorescent pigment dispersed in a resin, a stabilizer and a high boiling point organic solvent, wherein the stabilizer of the ink composition prevents the resin from polymerizing and the ink composition has a viscosity usable for a writing instrument. The preferred resta to disperse these pigments is an alkyd resin. To use alkyd resins in inks used for writing instruments, stabilizers must be used to prevent an alkyd from polymerizing to form a hard, insoluble film. If the alkyd polymerizes in a writing instrument, the writing instrument becomes non-functional; i.e. non-writing.<br><br>
