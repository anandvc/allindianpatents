				<th>Abstract</th>
				<td>In a first mode of dedicated control channel (DCCH) operation, a wireless terminal is allocated more segments than in a second mode. The wireless terminal uses different information bit to modulation symbol mapping in the different modes. On a per DCCH segment basis, the same number of modulation symbols are communicated in either mode but more information bits are conveyed in the second mode. Information bits for a DCCH segment are partitioned into two subsets. The two subsets are used to generate another set, each of the two subsets and the another set are input to the same mapping function to generate three equal size sets of modulation symbols which are transmitted via the DCCH segment. Uplink tone hopping is used such that one of the equal size sets of modulation symbols for the DCCH segment uses the same tone but a different set uses a different tone.</td>

QUALCOMM INCORPORATED, 5775 Morehouse Drive, San Diego, California 92121-1714 United states of America.<br><br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br><br><br>
WO 2007/075773<br><br>
PCT/US2006/048584<br><br>
METHODS AN*) APPARATUS TOR COMMUNICATING CONTROL INFORMATION<br><br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0001] The present invention relates to wireless communications methods and apparatus and, more particularly, to methods and apparatus related to communicating control information.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0002]      In multiple access wireless communications systems it is advantageous for wireless terminals currently using a base station attachment point to be able to communicate control information, e.g., control information reports, to that base station attachment point. The base station can utilize received control information reports to make intelligent decisions in terms of controlling operations of the wireless terminal, responding to the wireless terminal's traffic channel requests, and balancing between the plurality of wireless terminals currently competing for available resources. The efficient use of air link resources to convey control information is an important consideration in wireless system design as the control channel allocation represents resources devoted to overhead which could have otherwise been utilized for communicating traffic channel data.<br>
10003] In multiple access wireless communication systems there has been an increasing demand for concurrent users as the available services offered expands and the number of subscribers to service providers continues to grow. In view of the above,<br>

SUBSTITUTE SHEET (RULE 26) -2-<br><br>
WO 2007/075773<br><br>
PC17US2006/048584<br><br>
methods and apparatus that efficiently support increased numbers of concurrent users would be beneficial.<br>
[0004]      It would be advantageous if methods and apparatus were directed to achieving a balance between control channel resources and user data resources. A wireless terminal typically may have different requirements at different times, e.g., as a function of the type of application in uses, the number of concurrent applications in use, the user data rate needed, the latency requirements, etc. Methods and apparatus that allow a wireless terminal to operate in different modes of operation in which the wireless terminal receives different amounts of uplink control channel air link resources at different times would be beneficial. It would also be beneficial if control channel communications, e.g., via a dedicated uplink control channel segment, were tailored to facilitate different modes of control channel operation. For example, if a wireless terminal was currently allocated a relatively lower level of dedicated control channel segments it might be desirable to use a coding and modulation scheme for a dedicated control channel segment which sacrificed some redundancy to achieve the benefit of a higher control information bit throughput.<br>
[0005]      If one communicates a block of information bits over a single segment using a single tone and the system interference level on the tone happens to be high, the information may be lost. Methods and apparatus such as tone hopping would be beneficial in improving diversity and increasing the likelihood that the information bits of a segment be successfully communicated. It would be advantageous if tone hopping was coordinated with the coding and modulation method utilized such that corruption of one tone did not significantly impact successful recovery.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
[0006]      Various embodiments are directed to methods of operating a wireless terminal to determine modulation symbols to be transmitted in accordance with a first information bit to modulation symbol mapping procedure when in a first mode of control channel operation and determining modulation symbols to be transmitted in accordance with a second information bit to modulation symbol mapping procedure<br>

PCTAJS2006/048584<br><br>
when in a second mode of control channel operation. In some embodiments the modulation symbols are modulation symbols transmitted on individual tones, e.g., an individual BPSK or QPSK modulation symbol transmitted on a tone during the duration of a symbol transmission time period, e.g., an OFDM symbol transmission time period. In some embodiments, the first and second modes of operation are dedicated control channel modes of operation. In one exemplary embodiment, the first dedicated control channel mode of operation is a mode of operation in which the wireless terminal is dedicated a single logical tone of a dedicated control channel to the exclusion of other wireless tenninal and the second dedicated control channel mode of operation is a mode of operation in which the wireless terminal is dedicated a single logical tone of a dedicated control channel which may be shared with other wireless terminals with each of the wireless terminals sharing the same logical dedicated control channel tone being dedicated time periods for usage of the tone which are non-overlapping with the time usage periods dedicated to other wireless terminals sharing the same dedicated control channel tone. In various embodiments, a logical tone of a dedicated control channel is tone hopped according to a tone hopping schedule. For example, a dedicated control channel segment corresponding to the wireless terminal and a single logical tone, in some embodiments, corresponds to multiple physical tones in a block of tones being used for the uplink, with the logical tone corresponding to a different physical tone at different points in time in the segment.<br>
[0007]      In some embodiments, determining modulation symbols to be transmited in accordance with a first information bit to mapping procedure when in a firs! mode of control channel operation includes: generating X modulation symbols from M information bits where X is a positive integer greater than M; and determining modulation symbols to be transmitted in accordance with a second information bit to modulation symbol mapping procedure when in a second mode of control channel operation includes: generating X modulation symbols from N information bits where X is a positive integer greater than N, and wherein N is greater than M. In some such embodiments, X is a multiple of three and M and N are even positive integers. In one such embodiment X is 21, M is 6 and N is 8.<br>

PCT/US2006/048584<br><br>
[0908]      In various embodiments, generating X modulation symbols from M information bits during a first mode of operation includes: partitioning the M information bits into First and second subsets of information bits of equal size; generating a third set of bits as a function of the first and second subsets of bits, the third set of bits being the same size as the first and second subsets of bits; and determining for each of the first subset of information bits, second subset of information bits and third set of bits, using a first mapping function, and equal number of said X modulation symbols, the first mapping function used to determine each of said equal number of of X modulation symbols being the same. In some such embodiments, the signle logical dedicated control channel tone is hopped according to a tone hopping schedule but remains the same for each period of time used to transmit one of said equal number of X modulation symbols.<br>
[00091      In various embodiments, generating X modulation symbols from N information bits during a second mode of operation includes: partitioning the N information bits into fourth and fifth subsets of information bits of equal size; generating a sixth set of bits as a function of the fourth and fifth subsets of bits, the sixth set of bits being the same size as the fourth and fifth subsets of bits; and determining for each of the fourth subset of information bits, fifth subset of information bits and sixth set of bits, using a second mapping function, and equal number of said X modulation symbols, the second mapping function used to determine each of said equal number of of X modulation symbols being the same. In some such embodiments, the single logical dedicated control channel tone is hopped according to a tone hopping schedule but remains the same for each period of time used to transmit one of said equal number of X modulation symbols.<br>
[0010]      In some embodiments, at least one of generating a third set of bits and generating a sixth set of bits includes performing a bit wise exclusive OR operation. In some such embodiments, both generating a third set of bits and generating a sixth set of bit each includes performing a bit wise exclusive OR operation.<br>
[0011]      In various embodiments, the exemplary method also includes transmitting sets of X generated modulation symbols in individual control channel<br>

segments, the control channel segments used during the first and second modes of operation being the same size.<br>
[0012]      Some embodiments are directed to apparatus used to implement the above described methods. For example in one exemplary embodiment, a wireless terminal includes a modulation symbol determination module for determining modulation symbols to be transmitted in accordance with a first information bit to modulation symbol mapping procedure when in a first mode of control channel operation and for determining modulation symbols to be transmitted in accordance with a second information bit to modulation symbol mapping procedure when in a second mode of control channel operation and a transmission module for transmitting modulation symbols determined by said mosulation symbol determination module.<br>
[0013]      In an exemplary embodiment, a wireless communications system supports an uplink dedicated control channel (DCCH) using full-tone format and split tone format. When DCCH full tone-format is used, a first coding and modulation scheme is used to generate a set of modulation symbols for a DCCH segment, while when in the split-tone format a second coding and modulation scheme is used to generate a set of modulation symbols for a DCCH segment.<br>
[0014]      In one exemplary embodiment for a DCCH segment, in the full-tone format 6 information bits are mapped to 21 modulation symbols to be convcyed by 21 OFDM tone-symbols, while in the split-tone format 8 information bits are mapped to 21 modulation symbols to be conveyed by 21 OFDM symbols.<br>
10015]      The 21 OFDM tone-symbols of a segment are grouped into three subsets of seven OFDM tone-symbols, each corresponding to a dwell. Tone hopping is implemented such that the same logical DCCH channel tone can correspond to different physical tones for different dwells. In the full tone format, the set of 6 information bits is partitioned into a first group of 3 bits and a second group of 3 bits. A third set of 3 bits, representing redundant information, is generated from an exclusive OR operation between the first and second groups. The same first mapping function is used on each of the (first, second, and third) groups of bits to generate a (first, second, and third) set<br>
SUBSTITUTE SHEET (RULE 26)<br><br><br>
WO 2007/075773<br><br>
PCT/US2006/048584<br><br>
of seven modulation symbol values, to be communicated in (first, second, and third) dwells, respectively. In the full-tone format, the modulation symbol values of a DCCH segment are restricted to two possible values, e.g., (1,0) and (-1,0).<br>
[0016]      In the split tone format, the set of 8 information bits is partitioned into a first group of 4 bits and a second group of 4 bits. A third set of 4 bits, representing redundant information, is generated from an exclusive OR operation between the first and second groups. The same second mapping function is used on each of the (first, second, and third) groups of bits to generate a (first, second, and third) set of seven modulation symbol values, to be communicated in (first, second, and third) dwells, respectively. In the split-tone format, the modulation symbol values of a DCCH segment are restricted to four possible values, e.g., (1,0), (-1,0), (0,1), and (0,-1).<br>
[0017)      Various embodiments are directed to base station apparatus and methods for recovering control channel information transmitted by wireless terminals using first and second control channel modes of operation. An exemplary method of operating a base station includes: storing information indicating the mode of control channel operation in which wireless terminals are operating; recovering modulation symbols communicated using a first information bit to modulation symbol mapping procedure when said modulation symbols are received from a wireless terminal operating in a first mode of control channel operation; and recovering modulation symbols communicated using a second information bit to modulation symbol mapping procedure when said modulation symbols are received from a wireless terminal operating in a second mode of control channel operation. An exemplary base station includes: a memory including stored information indicating the mode of control channel operation in which wireless terminals are operating; a first modulation symbol recovery module for recovering modulation symbols communicated using a first information bit to modulation symbol mapping procedure when said modulation symbols are received from a wireless terminal operating in a first mode of control channel operation; and a-second modulation symbol recovery module recovering modulation symbols communicated using a second information bit to modulation symbol mapping procedure when said modulation symbols are received from a wireless terminal operating in a second mode of control channel operation.<br>

[0097]      Figure 4 is a drawing 400 of exemplary uplink dedicated control channel (DCCH) segments in an exemplary uplink timing and frequency structure in an exemplary orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) multiple access wireless communications system. The uplink dedicated control channel is used to send Dedicated Control Reports (DCR) from wireless terminals to base stations. Vertical axis 402 plots logical uplink tone index while horizontal axis 404 plots the uplink index of the halfslot within a beaconslot. In this example, an uplink tone block includes 113 logical uplink tones indexed (0,..., 112); there are seven successive OFDM symbol transmission time periods within a halfslot, 2 additional OFDM symbol time periods followed by 16 successive half-slots within a superslot, and 8 successive superslots within a beacon slot. The first 9 OFDM symbol transmission time periods within a superslot are an access interval, and the dedicated control channel does not use the air link resources of the access interval.<br>
[0098]      The exemplary dedicated control channel is subdivided into 31 logical tones (uplink tone index 81 406, uplink tone index 82 408,... , uplink tone index 111 410). Each logical uplink tone (81,.... 111) in the logical uplink frequency structure corresponds to a logical tone indexed with respect to the DCCH channel (0,..., 30).<br>
[0099]      For each tone in the dedicated control channel there are 40 segments in<br>
the beaconslot corresponding to forty columns (412, 414,416, 418,420, 422	424).<br>
The segment structure repeats on a beaconslot basis. For a given tone in the dedicated control channel there are 40 segments corresponding to a beaconslot 428; each of the eight superslots of the beaconslot includes S successive segments for the given tone. For example, for first superslot 426 of beaconslot 428, corresponding to tone 0 of the DCCH, there are five indexed segments (segment [0][0], segment [0][I], segment [0][2], segment [0][3], segment [0][4]). Similarly, for first superslot 426 of beaconslot<br>
SUBSTITUTE SHEET (RULE 26) -19-<br><br>
WO 2007/075773<br><br>
PCT/US2006/048584<br><br>
428, corresponding to tone 1 of the DCCH, there are five indexed segments (segment [1][0], segment [1][1], segment [1][2], segment [1][3], segment [1][4]). Similarly, for first superslot 426 of beaconstot 428, corresponding to tone 30 of the DCCH, there are five indexed segments (segment [30][0], segment [30][l]. segment [30][2], segment [30][3], segment [30][4]).<br>
[00100]      In this example each segment, e.g., segment [0][0], comprises one tone for 3 successive half-slots, e.g., representing an allocated uplink air link resource of 21 OFDM tone-symbols. In some embodiments, logical uplink tones are hopped to physical tones in accordance with an uplink tone hopping sequence such that the physical tone associated with a logical tone may be different for successive half-slots, but remains constant during a given half-slot.<br>
[00101]      In some embodiments, a set of uplink dedicated control channel segments corresponding to a given tone can use one of a plurality of different formats. For example, in an exemplary embodiment, for a given tone for a beaconslot, the set of DCCH segments can use one of two formats: split tone format and full-tone format. In the full tone format, the set of uplink DCCH segments corresponding to a tone are used by a single wireless terminal. In the split tone format, the set of uplink DCCH segment corresponding to the tone are shared by up to three wireless terminals in a time division multiplexing manner. The base station and/or the wireless terminal can, in some embodiments, change the format for a given DCCH tone, using predetermined protocols. The format of the uplink DCCH segments corresponding to a different DCCH tone can, in some embodiments, be independently set and may be different.<br>
[00102]       In some embodiments, in either format, the wireless terminal shall support a default mode of the uplink dedicated control channel segments. In some embodiments, the wireless terminal supports the default mode of the uplink dedicated control channel segments and one or more additional modes of the uplink dedicated control channel segments. Such a mode defines the interpretation of the information bits in the uplink dedicated control channel segments. The base station and/or the WT can, in some embodiments, change the mode, e.g., using an upper layer configuration protocol. In various embodiments, the uplink DCCH segments corresponding to a<br>

different tone or those corresponding to the same tone but used by different WTs can be independently set and may be different.<br>
[00103]      Figure 5 includes a drawing 500 of an exemplary dedicated control channel in an exemplary uplink timing and frequency structure in an exemplary orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) multiple access wireless communications system. Drawing 500 may represent the DCCH 400 of Figure 4, at a time when each set of DCCH segments corresponding to a tone is in the full-tone format. Vertical axis 502 plots logical tone index of the DCCH while horizontal axis 504 plots the uplink index of the halfslot within a beaconslot. The exemplary dedicated control channel is subdivided into 31 logical tones (tone index 0 506, tone index 1 508, ..., tone index 30 510). For each tone in the dedicated control channel there are 40 segments in the beaconslot corresponding to forty columns (512, 514, 516, 518, 520, 522,..., 524). Each logical tone of the dedicated control channel may be assigned by the base station to a different wireless terminal using the base station as its current point of attachment. For example, logical (tone 0 506, tone 1 508,..., tone 30 510) may be currently assigned to (WT A 530, WT B 532,..., WT N" 534), respectively.<br>
[00104]      Figure 6 includes a drawing 600 of an exemplary dedicated control channel in an exemplary uplink timing and frequency structure in an exemplary orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) multiple access wireless communications system. Drawing 600 may represent the DCCH 400 of Figure 4, at a time when each set of DCCH segments corresponding to a tone is in the split-tone format. Vertical axis 602 plots logical tone index of the DCCH while horizontal axis 604 plots the uplink index of the halfslot within a beaconslot. The exemplary dedicated control channel is subdivided into 31 logical tones (tone index 0 606, tone index 1 608, ... , tone index 30 610). For each tone in the dedicated control channel there are 40 segments in the beaconslot corresponding to forty columns (612, 614, 616, 618, 620, 622,..., 624). Each logical tone of the dedicated control channel may be assigned by the base station to up to 3 different wireless terminals using the base station as their current point of attachment For a given tone, the segments alternate between the three wireless terminals, with 13 segments being allocated for each of the three wireless terminals, and the 40* segment is reserved. This exemplary division of air link<br>

resources of the DCCH channel represents a total of 93 different wireless terminals being allocated DCCH channel resources for the exemplary beaconslot. For example, logical tone 0 606 may be currently assigned to and shared by WT A 630, WT B 632, and WT C 634; logical tone 1 608 may be currently assigned to and shared by WT D 636, WT E 638, and WT F 640; logical tone 30 610 may be currently assigned to WT M"' 642, WT N"' 644, and WT O" 646. For the beaconslot, each of the exemplary WTs (630, 632, 634, 636, 638, 640, 642, 644, 646) is allocated 13 DCCH segments.<br>
[00105]      Figure 7 includes a drawing 700 of an exemplary dedicated control channel in an exemplary uplink timing and frequency structure in an exemplary orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) multiple access wireless communications system. Drawing 700 may represent the DCCH 400 of Figure 4, at a time when some of the sets of DCCH segments corresponding to a tone are in the full-tone format and some of the sets of DCCH segments corresponding to a tone are in the split-tone format. Vertical axis 702 plots logical tone index of the DCCH while horizontal axis 704 plots the uplink index of the halfslot within a beaconslot. The exemplary dedicated control channel is subdivided into 31 logical tones (tone index 0 706, tone index 1 708, tone index 2 709,..., tone index 30 710). For each tone in the dedicated control channel there are 40 segments in the beaconslot corresponding to forty columns(712, 714,716,718, 720, 722,... ,724). In this example, the set of segments corresponding to logical tone 0 708 is in split-tone format and is currently assigned to and shared by WT A 730, WT B 732, and WTC 734, each receiving 13 segments with one segment being reserved. The set of segments corresponding to logical tone 1 708 is also in split-tone format, but is currently assigned to and shared by two WTs, WT D 736, WT E 738, each receiving 13 segments. For tone 1 708, there is a set of 13 unassigned segments, and one reserved segment. The set of segments corresponding to logical tone 2 709 is also in split-tone format, but is currently assigned to one WT, WT F 739, receiving 13 segments. For tone 2 709, there are two sets with 13 unassigned segments per set, and one reserved segment. The set of segments corresponding to logical tone 30 710 is in full-tone format and is currently assigned to WT P' 740, with WTP' 740 receiving the full 40 segments to use.<br>

[00106]      Figure 8 is a drawing 800 illustrating the use of format and mode in an exemplary uplink DCCH in accordance with various embodiments, the mode defining the interpretation of the information bits in the DCCH segments. Row 802, corresponding to one tone of the DCCH, illustrates 15 successive segments of the DCCH, in which the split tone-format is used and thus the tone is shared by three wireless terminals, and the mode used by any one of the three WTs can be different. Meanwhile, row 804 illustrates 15 successive DCCH segments using the full tone format and is used by a single wireless terminal. Legend 805 indicates that: segments with vertical line shading 806 are used by a 1st WT user, segments with diagonal line shading 808 are used by a 2nd WT user, segments with horizontal line shading 810 are used by a 3 rd WT user, and segments with Crosshatch shading 812 are used by a 4 th WT user.<br>
[00107]      Figure 9 illustrates several examples corresponding to drawing 800 illustrating different modes of operation. In the example of drawing 900, 1st, 2nd and 3rd WTs are sharing a DCCH tone in the split tone format while the 4th WT is using a tone in the full tone format. Each of the WTs corresponding to the example of drawing 900 are using the default mode of uplink dedicated control channel segments, following a default mode interpretation of the information bits in the DCCH segments. The default mode for split tone format (Ds) is different than the default mode for full tone format (DF).<br>
[00108]       In the example of drawing 920, 1st, 2nd and 3rd WTs are sharing a DCCH tone in the split tone format while the 4th WT is using a tone in the full tone format Each of the (1st, 2nd, and 3rd) WTs corresponding to the example of drawing 920 are using different modes of uplink dedicated control channel segments, each following different interpretations of the information bits in the DCCH segments. The 1* WT is using mode 2 for split-tone format, the 2nd wireless terminal is using the default mode for split-tone format, and the 3rd WT is using mode 1 for split-tone format. In addition the 4th WT is using the default mode for full-tone format.<br>
[00109]      In the example of drawing 940, lst, 2nd and 3rd WTs are sharing a DCCH tone in the split tone format while the 4th WT is using a tone in the full tone format.<br>

Each of the (Ist, 2nd, 3rd,and 4th ) WTs corresponding to the example of drawing 940 are using different modes of uplink dedicated control channel segments, each following different interpretations of the information bits in the DCCH segments. The 1st WT is using mode 2 for split-tone format, the 2nd wireless terminal is using the default mode for split-tone format, the 3rd WT is using mode 1 for split tone format, and the 4th WT is using mode 3 for full-tone format.<br>
[00110]      Figure 10 is a drawing 1099 illustrating an exemplary default mode of the full tone format in a beaconslot for a given DCCH tone. In Figure 10, each block (1000,1001, 1002, 1003, 1004, 1005,1006,1007, 1008, 1009, 1010, 1011,1012, 1013, 1014, 1015, 1016,1017, 1018,1019, 1020,1021,1022, 1023,1024, 1025,1026, 1027, 1028, 1029, 1030, 1031, 1032, 1033, 1034, 1035, 1036, 1037,1038, 1039) represents one segment whose index s2 (0,..., 39) is shown above the block in rectangular region 1040. Each block, e.g., block 1000 representing segment 0, conveys 6 information bits; each block comprises 6 rows corresponding to the 6 bits in the segment, where the bits are listed from the most significant bit to the least significant bit downwards from the top row to the bottom row as shown in rectangular region 1043.<br>
[00111]      For the exemplary embodiment, the framing format shown in Figure 10 is used repeatedly in every beaconslot, when the default mode of full-tone format is used, with the following exception. In the first uplink superslot after the wireless terminal migrates to the ON state in the current connection, the WT shall use the framing format shown in Figure 11. The first uplink superslot is defined: for a scenario when the WT migrates to the ON state from the ACCESS state, for a scenario when the WT migrates to the ON state from a HOLD state, and for a scenario when the WT migrates to the ON state from the ON state of another connection.<br>
[00112]      Figure 11 illustrates an exemplary definition of the default mode in the full-tone fonnat of the uplink DCCH segments in the first uplink superslot after the WT migrates to the ON state. Drawing 1199 includes five successive segments (1100, 1101, 1102, 1103, 1104) corresponding to segment index numbers, s2 = (0, 1,2, 3,4), respectively in the superslot as indicated by rectangle 1106 above the segments. Each block, e.g., block 1100 representing segment 0 of the superslot, conveys 6 information<br>

bits; each block comprises 6 rows corresponding to the 6 bits in the segment, where the bits are listed from the most significant bit to the least significant bit downwards from the top row to the bottom row as shown in rectangular region 1108.<br>
[00113]      In the exemplary embodiment, in the scenario of migrating from the HOLD to ON state, the WT starts to transmit the uplink DCCH channel from the beginning of the first UL superslot, and therefore the first uplink DCCH segment shall transport the information bits in the leftmost information column of Figure 11, the information bits of segment 1100. In the exemplary embodiment, in the scenario of migrating from the ACCESS state, the WT does not necessarily start from the beginning of the first UL superslot, but does still transmit the uplink DCCH segments according to the framing fonnat specified in Figure 11. For example, if the WT starts to transmit the UL DCCH segments from the halfslot of the superslot with index =4, then the WT skips the leftmost information column of Figure 11 (segment 1100) and the first uplink DCCH segment transports the second leftmost column (segment 1101). Note that in the exemplary embodiment, superslot indexed halfslots (1-3) correspond to one DCCH segment (1100) and superslot indexed halfslots (4-6) correspond to the next segment (1101). In the exemplary embodiment, for the scenario of switching between the full-tone and split-tone formats, the WT uses the framing format shown in Figure 10 without the above exception of using the format shown in Figure 11.<br>
[00114]      Once, the first UL superslot ends, the uplink DCCH channel segments switch to the framing format of Figure 10. Depending on where, the first uplink superslot ends, the point of switching the framing format may or may not be the beginning of a beaconslot. Note that in this example embodiment, there are five DCCH segments for a given DCCH tone for a superslot. For example, suppose that the first uplink superslot is of uplink beaconslot superslot index =2, where beaconslot superslot index range is from 0 to 7. Subsequently in the next uplink superslot, which is of uplink beaconslot superslot index = 3, the first uplink DCCH segment using the default framing format of Figure 10 is of index s2=15 (segment 1015 of Figure 10) and transports the information corresponding to segment s2=15 (segment 1015 of Figure 10).<br>

[00115]      Each uplink DCCH segment is used to transmit a set of Dedicated Control Channel Reports (DCRs). An exemplary summary list of DCRs in the full-tone format for the default mode is given in table 1200 Figure .12. The information of table 1200 is applicable to the partitioned segments of Figures 10 and 11. Each segment of Figure 10 and 11 includes two or more reports as described in table 1200. First column 1202 of table 1200 describes abbreviated names used for each exemplary report. The name of each report ends with a number which specifies the number of bits of the DCR. Second column 1204 of table 1200 briefly describes each named report. Third column 1206 specifies the segment index s2 of Figure 10, in which a DCR is to be transmitted, and corresponds to a mapping between table 1200 and Figure 10.<br>
[00116]      The exemplary 5 bit absolute report of downlink signal to noise ratio (DLSNR5) shall now be described. The exemplary DLSNR5 uses one of the following two mode formats. When the WT has only one connection, the non-DL macrodiversity mode format is used. When the WT has multiple connections, the DL-macrodiversity mode format is used if the WT is in the DL-maacrodiversity mode; otherwise the non-macrodiversity mode format is used. In some embodiments, whether the WT is in the DL-macrodiversity mode and/or how the WT switches between the DL macrodiversity mode and the non-DL macrodiversity mode are specified in an upper layer protocol. In the non-DL macro-diversity mode the WT reports the measured received downlink pilot channel segment SNR using the closest representation of Table 1300 of Figure 13. Figure 13 is a table 1300 of an exemplary format of DLSNR5 in non-DL macrodiversity mode. First column 1302 list 32 possible bit pattern that may be represented by the 5 bits of the report. Second column1304 lists the value of wtDLPICHSNR being communicated to the base station via the report. In this example, incremental levels from -12dB to 29dB can be indicated corresponding to 31 different bit patterns, while bit pattern 11111 is reserved.<br>
[00117]      For example, if the calculated wtDLPICHSNR based on measurement is -14dB, the DLSNR5 report is set to bit pattern 00000; if the calculated wtDLPICHSNR based on measurement is -11.6dB, the DLSNR5 report is set to bit pattern 00000 because in table ] 300 the entry with -12dB is the closet to the calculated value of -11.6 dB; if the calculated wtDLPICHSNR based on measurement is-11. 4dB, the DLSNR5<br>
SUBSTITUTE SHEET (RULE 26)<br><br><br>

report is set to bit pattern 00001 because in table 1300 the entry with -11dB is the closet to the calculated value of -11.4 dB.<br>
[00118]      The reported wireless terminal downlink pilot SNR (wtDLPICHSNR) accounts for the fact that the pilot signal, on which the SNR is measured, is typically transmitted at higher power than the average traffic channel power. For this reason, the pilot SNR is, in some embodiments, reported as,<br>
wtDLPlCHSNR = PilotSNR - Delta,<br>
where pilotSNR is the measured SNR on the received downlink pilot channel signal in dB, and Delta is a difference between the pilot transmission power and an average per tone channel transmission power level, e.g. the average per tone downlink traffic channel transmission power. In some embodiments Delta = 7.5 dB.<br>
(00119]      In the DL-macrodiversity mode format the WT uses the DLSNR5 report to inform a base station sector attachment point, whether the current downlink connection with the base station sector attachment point is a preferred connection, and to report the calculated wtDLPlCHSNR with the closest DLSNR5 report according to table 1400. Figure 14 is a table 1400 of an exemplary format of DLSNR5 in DL macrodiversily mode. First column 1402 list 32 possible bit patterns that may be represented by the 5 bits of the report. Second column 1404 lists the value of wtDLPlCHSNR being communicated to the base station via the report and an indication as to whether or not the connection is preferred. In this example, incremental levels of SNR from -12db to 13dB can be indicated corresponding to 32 different bit patterns. Sixteen of the bit patterns correspond to the case where the connection is not preferred; while the remaining sixteen bit patterns correspond to the case where the connection is preferred. In some exemplary embodiments, the highest SNR value that can be indicated when a link is preferred is greater than the highest SNR value that can be indicated when a link is not preferred In some exemplary embodiments, the lowest SNR that can be indicated when a link is preferred is greater than the lowest SNR value that can be indicated when a link is not preferred.<br>

[00120]      In some embodiments, in the DL-macrodiversity mode, the wireless terminal indicates one and only one connection to be the preferred connection at any given time. Furthermore, in some such embodiments, if the WT indicates that a connection is preferred in a DLSNR5 report, then the WT sends at least NumConsecutive Preferred consecutive DLSNR5 reports indicating that the connection is preferred before the WT is allowed to a send a DLSNR5 report indicating that another connection becomes the preferred one. The value of the parameter NumConsecutive preferred depends on the format of the uplink DCCH channel, e.g., full-tone format vs split-tone format). In some embodiments the WT gets the parameter NumConsecutivePreferred in an upper level protocol,in some embodiments, the default value of NumConsecutivePreferred is 10 in the full-tone format.<br>
[00121]      An exemplary 3 bit relative (difference) report of downlink SNR (DLDSNR3) shall now be described. The wireless terminal measures the received SNR of the downlink pilot channel (PilotSNR), calculates the wtDLPICHSNR value.where wtDLPICHSNR = PilotSNR - Delta, calculates the difference between the calculated wtDLPICHSNR value and the reported value by the most recent DLSNR5 report, and reports the calculated difference with the closest DLD5NR3 report according to table 1500 of Figure 15. Figure 15 is a table 1500 of an exemplary format of DLDSNR3. First column 1502 lists 9 possible bit patterns that may represent the 3 information bits of the report. Second column 1504 lists the reported difference in wtDLPICHSNR being communicated to the base station via the report ranging from -5dB to 5dB.<br>
[00122]      Various exemplary uplink traffic channel request reports will now be described. In an exemplary embodiment three types of uplink traffic channel request reports are used: an exemplary single bit uplink traffic channel request report (ULRQST1), an exemplary three bit uplink traffic channel request report (ULRQST3), and an exemplary four bit uplink traffic channel request report (ULRQST4). The WT uses an ULRQST1, ULRQST3, or ULRQST4 to report the status of the MAC frame queues at the WT transmitter. In the exemplary embodiment, the MAC frames are constructed from the LLC frames, which are constructed from packets of upper layer protocols. In this exemplary embodiment, any packet belongs to one of four request groups (RG0, RGl, RG2, or RG3). In some exemplary embodiments, the mapping of<br>
SUBSTITUTE SHEET (RULE 26)<br><br><br>
WO 2007/075773<br><br>
PCT/US2006/048584<br><br>
packets to request groups is done through higher layer protocols. In some exemplary embodiments, there is a default mapping of packets to request groups, that may be changed by the base station and/or WT through higher layer protocols. If the packet belongs to one request group, then, in this exemplary embodiment, all the MAC frames of that packet also belong to that same request group. The WT reports the number of MAC frames in the 4 request groups that the WT may intend to transmit. In the ARQ protocol, those MAC frames are marked as "new" or "to be retransmitted". The WT maintains a vector of four elements N[0:3] for k = 0:3, N[k] represents the number of MAC frames that the WT intends to transmit in request group k. The WT should report the information about N[0:3] to the base station sector so that the base station sector can utilize the information in an uplink scheduling algorithm to determine the assignment of uplink traffic channel segments.<br>
[001Z3]      In an exemplary embodiment, the WT uses the single bit uplink traffic channel request report (ULRQST1) to report N[0] +-N[l] according to table 1600 of Figure 16. Table 1600 is an exemplary format for an ULRQST1 report. First column 1602 indicates the two possible bit patterns that may be conveyed while second column 1604 indicates the meaning of each bit pattern. If the bit pattern is 0, that indicates that there are no MAC frames that the WT intends to transmit in either request group 0 or request group 1. If the bit pattern is 1, that indicates that the WT has at least one MAC frame in request group 0 or request group 1 that the WT intends to communicate.<br>
[00124]      In accordance with a feature used in various embodiments, multiple request dictionaries are supported. Such a request dictionary defines the interpretation of the information bits in uplink traffic channel request reports in the uplink dedicated control channel segments. At a given time, the WT uses one request dictionary. In some embodiments, when the WT just enters the ACTIVE state, the WT uses a default request dictionary. To change the request dictionary the WT and base station sector use an upper layer configuration protocol. In some embodiments, when the WT migrates from the ON state to the HOLD state, the WT keeps the last request dictionary used in the ON state so that when the WT migrates from the HOLD state to the ON state later, the WT continues to use the same request dictionary until the request dictionary is explicitly changed; however, if the WT leaves the ACTIVE state, then the memory of<br>
SUBSTITUTE SHEET (RULE 26)<br><br><br>
WO 2007/075773<br><br>
PCT/US2006/048584<br><br>
the last request dictionary is cleared. In some embodiments, the ACTIVE state includes the ON state and the Hold state, but does not include the ACCESS state and sleep state.<br>
[00125]       In some embodiments, to determine at least some ULRQST3 or ULRQST4 reports, the wireless terminal first calculates one or more of the following two control parameters y and z, and uses one of the request dictionaries, e.g., Request dictionary (RD) reference number 0, RD reference number 1, RD reference number 2, RD reference number 3. Table 1700 of Figure 17 is an exemplary table used to calculate control parameters y and z. First column 1702 lists a condition; second column 1704 lists the corresponding value of output control parameter y; third column 1706 lists the corresponding value of output control parameter z. In first column 1702, x (in dBs) represents the value of the most recent 5 bit uplink transmit backoff report (ULTXBKF5) and the value b (in dBs) of the most recent 4 bit downlink beacon ratio report (DLBNR4). Given the input values of x and b from the most recent reports, the WT checks if the condition from first row 1710 is satisfied. If the test condition is satisfied, then the WT uses me corresponding y and z values of the row for calculating the ULRQST3 or ULRQST4. However, if the condition is not satisfied the testing continues with the next row 1712. Testing continues proceeding down the table 1700 in order from top to bottom (1710,1712, 1714,1716, 1718, 1720,1722, 1724, 1726, 1728) until the condition listed in column 1702 for a given row is satisfied. The WT determines y and z as those from the first row in table 1700 for which the first column is satisfied. For example, if x = 17 and b =1, then z =4 and y = 1.<br>
[00126]      The WT, in some embodiments, uses an ULRQST3 or ULRQST4 to report the actual N[0:3] of the MAC frames queues according to a request dictionary. A request dictionary is identified by a request dictionary (R-D) reference number.<br>
[00127]      In some embodiments, at least some request dictionaries are such that any ULRQST4 or ULRQST3 may not completely include the actual N[0:3]. A report is in effect a quantized version of the actual N[0:3]. In sqrpe embodiments, the WT sends a report to minimize the discrepancy between the reported and actual MAC frame queues first for request group 0 and 1, and then for request group 2, and finally for request group 3. However, in some embodiments, the WT has the flexibility of<br>
SUBSTITUTE SHEET (RULE 26)<br><br><br>

PCT/US2O06/048584<br><br>
determining a report to benefit the WT most For example, assume that the WT is using exemplary request dictionary 1 (See Figures 20 and 21), the WT may use aa ULRQST4 to report N[l] + N[3] and use an ULRQST3 to report N[2] and N[0]. In addition if a report is directly related to a subset of request groups according to the request dictionary, it does not automatically imply that MAC frame queues of a remaining request group are empty. For example, if a report means N[2] = 1, then it may not automatically imply that N[0] = 0, N[I] = 0, or N[3] = 0.<br>

[00136]      In accordance with various embodiments, the methods facilitate a wide range of reporting possibilities. For example, the use of control parameters, e.g., based on SNR and backoff reports, allow for a single bit pattern request corresponding to a given dictionary to take on multiple interpretations. Consider exemplary request dictionary reference number 0 for 4 bit uplink requests as shown in table 1800 of Figure 18. For a four bit request where each bit pattern corresponds to a fixed interpretations and does not rely on control parameters, 16 possibilities exists. However, in table 1800 four of the bit patterns (0011, 0100, 0101, and 0110) can each have two different interpretations since control parameter y can have value 1 or 2. Similarly, in table 1800 nine of the bit patterns (0111, 1000, 1001, 1010, 1011, UOO, 1101, 1110, and 1111) can each have 10 different interpretations since control parameter z can have any of the values (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8,9, 10). This use of control parameters expands the range of reporting for the 4 bit request report from 16 different possibilities to 111 possibilities.<br>

[00137]      An exemplary 5 bit wireless terminal transmitter power backoff report (ULTxBKF5) will now be described. A wireless terminal backoff report reports an amount of remaining power that the WT has to use for uplink transmissions for non-DCCH segments, e.g., including uplink traffic channel segment(s) after taking into account the power used to transmit the DCCH segments. wtULDCCHBackoff= wtPowerMax - wtULDCCHTxPower; where wtULDCCHTxPower denotes the per-tone transmission power of the uplink DCCH channel in dBm, and wtPowerMax is the maximum transmission power value of the WT, also in dBm. Note that the wtULDCCHTxPower represents the instantaneous power and is calculated using the wtPowerNominal in the halfslot immediately preceeding the current uplink DCCH segment In some such embodiments, the per tone power of the uplink DCCH channel relative to wtPowerNominal is OdBs. The value of wtPowerMax depends on the device capability of the WT, upon system specifications and/or upon regulations. In some embodiments, the determination of wtPowerMax is implementation dependent.<br>
[00138]      Figure 26 is a table 2600 identifying bit format and interpretations associated with each of 32 bit patterns for an exemplary 5 bit uplink transmitter power backoff report (ULTxBKF5), in accordance with various embodiments. First column 2602 identifies the bit pattern and bit ordering, most significant bit to least significant bit. Second column 2604 identifies the reported WT uplink DCCH Backoff report values in dBs corresponding to each bit pattern. In this exemplary embodiment 30 distinct levels can be reported ranging from 6.5 dB to 40dBs; two bit patterns are left as reserved. A wireless terminal calculates wtULDCCHBackoff, e.g., as indicated above, selects the closet entry in table 2600 and uses that bit pattern for the report.<br>
[00139]      An exemplary 4 bit downlink beacon ratio report (DLBNR4) will now be described. The beacon ratio report provides information which is a function of received measured downlink broadcast signals, e.g„ beacon signals and/or pilot signals, from a serving base station sector and from one or more other interfering base station sectors. Qualitatively, the beacon ratio report can be used to estimate the relative proximity of the WT to other base station sectors. The beacon ratio report can be, and in some embodiments is, used at the serving BS sector in controlling the uplink rate of the WT to prevent excessive interference to other sectors. The beacon ratio report, in some<br>
SUBSTITUTE SHEET (RULE 26)<br><br><br>
WO 2007/075773<br><br>
PCT/US2006/048584<br><br>
embodiments, is based on two factors: (i) estimated channel gain ratios, denoted G;, and (ii) loading factors, denoted bi.<br>
[00140]]      The channel gain ratios are defined, in some embodiments, as follows. In the tone block of the current connection, the WT, in some embodiments, determines an estimate of the ratio of the uplink channel gain from the WT to any interfering Base station sector i (BSS i) to the channel gain from the WT to the serving BSS. This ratio is denoted as Gi- Typically, the uplink channel gain ratio is not directly measurable at the WT. However, since the uplink and downlink path gains are typically symmetric, the ratio can be estimated by comparing the relative received power of downlink signals from the serving and interfering BSSs. One possible choice for the reference downlink signal is the downlink beacon signal, which is well-suited for this purpose since it can be detected in very low SNR. In some embodiments, beacon signals have a higher per tone transmission power level than other downlink signals from a base station sector. Additionally, the characteristics of the beacon signal are such that precise timing synchronization is not necessary to detect and measure the beacon signal. For example, the beacon signal is, in some embodiments, a high power narrowband, e.g., single tone, two OFDM symbol transmission time period.wide signal. Thus at certain locations, a WT is able to detect and measure a beacon signal from a base station sector, where the detection and/or measurement of other downlink broadcast signals, e.g., pilot signals may not be feasible. Using the beacon signal, the uplink path ratio would be given by Gi = PBi/PBo, where PBi and PB0 are, respectively, the measured received beacon power from the interfering and serving base station sectors, respectively.<br>
[00141]      Since the beacon is typically transmitted rather infrequently, the power measurement of the beacon signal may not provide a very accurate representation of average channel gain, especially in a fading environment where the power changes rapidly. For example, in some embodiments one beacon signal, which occupies 2 successive OFDM symbol transmission time periods in duration and which corresponds to a downlink tone block of a base station sector, is transmitted for every beaconslot of 912 OFDM symbol transmission time periods.<br>
SUBSTITUTE SHEET (RULE 26)<br><br><br>
WO 2007/075773<br><br>
PCT/US2006/048584<br><br>
[00142]      Pilot signals, on the other hand, are often transmitted much more frequently than beacon signals, e.g., in some embodiments pilot signals are transmitted during 896 out of the 912 OFDM symbol transmission time periods of a beaconslot. If the WT can detect the pilot signal from the BS sector, it can estimate the received beacon signal strength from the measured received pilot signal instead of using a beacon signal measurement. For example, if the WT can measure the received pilot power, PPi of the interfering BS sector, then it can estimate the received beacon power PB; from estimated PBi =KZiPP;p where K is a nominal ratio of the beacon to pilot power of the interfering sector that is the same for each of the BS sectors, and Zi is a scaling factor that is sector dependent.<br>
[00143]      Similarly, if the pilot signal power from the serving BS is measurable at the WT, then the received beacon power PB0 can be estimated from the relation, estimated PBo =KZoPPo, where Zo and PP0 are, respectively, the scaling factor and measured received pilot power from the serving base station sector.<br>
[00144]      Observe mat if the received pilot signal strength is measurable corresponding to the serving base station sector, and the received beacon signal strength is measurable corresponding to interfering base station sector, the beacon ratio can be estimated from:<br>
Gi = PBi / (PP0 K Zo ).<br>
[00145]      Observe that if the pilot strengths are measurable in both the serving and interfering sectors, the beacon ratio can be estimated from:<br>
Gi = PPi K Zi /(PPo K. Zo ) = PPi Zi / (PPo Zo ) .<br>
[00146]      The scaling factors K, Zi and Zo are either system constants, or can be inferred by the WT, from other information from the BS. In some embodiments, some of the scaling factors (K, Zi, Zo) are system constants and some of the scaling factors (K, Zi, Z0) are inferred by the WT, from other information form the BS.<br>

[00147]      In some multicarrier systems with different power levels on different carriers, the scaling factors, Zi and Z0, are a function of the downlink tone block. For example, an exemplary BSS has three power tier levels, and one of the three power tier levels is associated with each downlink tone block corresponding to a BSS attachment point. In some such embodiments, a different one of the three power tier levels is associated with each of the different tone blocks of the BSS. Continuing with the example, for the given BSS, each power tier level is associated with a nominal bss power level (e.g., one of bssPowerNominalO, bssPowerNominall, and bssPowerNominal2) and the pilot channel signal is transmitted at a relative power level with respect to a nominal bss power level for the tone block, e.g., 7.2dB above the nominal bss power level being used by the tone block; however, the beacon per tone relative transmission power level for the BSS is the same irrespective of the tone block from which the beacon is transmitted, e.g., 23.8 dB above the bss power level used by the power tier 0 block (bssPowerNominalO). Consequently, in this example for a given BSS, the beacon transmit power would be the same in each of the tone blocks, while the pilot transmit power is different, e.g. with the pilot transmit power of different tone blocks corresponding to different power tier levels. One set of scale factors for this example would be, K = 23.8 - 7.2 dB, which is the ratio of the beacon to pilot power for tier 0, and Zi is set to the relative nominal power of the tier of the interfering sector to the power of a tier 0 sector.<br>
[00148]       In some embodiments, the parameter ZQ is determined from stored information, e.g., Table 2700 of Figure 27, according to how the tone block of the current connection is used in the serving BSS as determined by the bssSectorType of the serving BSS. For example, if the tone block of the current connection is used as a tier 0 tone block by the serving BSS, the Zo=l; if the tone block of the current connection is used as a tier 1 tone block by the serving BSS, the Zo=bssPowerBackoff01; if the tone block of the current connection is used as a tier 2 tone block by the serving BSS, the Zo=bssPowerBackoffl02.<br>
|00149]       Figure 27 includes exemplary power scaling factor table 2700, implemented in accordance with various embodiments. First column 2702 lists the use of the tone block as either a tier 0 tone block, tier 1 tone block, or tier 2 tone block.<br>

Second column 2704 lists the scaling factor associated with each tier (0,1,2) tone block, as (1, bssPowerBackoff0l, bssPowerBackoff02), respectively. In some embodiments, bssPowerBackoff0l is 6dBs while bssPowerBackoff02 is 12dB.<br>
[00150]      In some embodiments, the DCCH DLBNR4 report can be one of a generic beacon ratio report and a special beacon ratio report. In some such embodiments, a downlink traffic control channel, e.g., a DL.TCCH.FLASH channel, sends a special frame in a beaconslot, the special frame including a "Request for DLBNR4 report field". That field can be used by the serving BSS to control the selection. For example, if the field is set to zero then, the WT reports a generic beacon ratio report; otherwise the WT reports the special beacon ratio report.<br>
[00151]      A generic beacon ratio report, in accordance with some embodiments, measures the relative interference cost the WT would generate to all the interfering beacons or the "closest" interfering beacon, if the WT were to transmit to the serving BSS in the current connection. A special beacon ratio report, in accordance with some embodiments, measures the relative interference cost the WT would generate to a specific BSS, if the WT were to transmit to the serving BSS in the current connection. The specific BSS is the one indicated using information received in the Request for DLBNR4 field of the special downlink frame. For example, in some embodiments, the specific BSS is the one whose bssSlope is equal to the value of the "Request for DLBNR4 report field", e.g., in unsigned integer format, and whose bssSectorType is equal to mod(ulUltraslotBeaconslotIndex,3), where ulUltraslotBeaconsloUndex is the uplink index of the beaconslot within the ultraslot of the current connection. In some exemplary embodiments, there are 18 indexed beaconslots within an ultraslot.<br>
[00152]      In various embodiments, both the generic and the special beacon ratios are determined from the calculated channel gain ratios Gl, G2,..., as follows. The WT receives an uplink loading factor sent in a downlink broadcast system subchannel and determines a variable b0 from uplink loading factor table 2800 of Figure 28. Table 2800 includes a first column 2802 listing eight different values that may be used for the uplink loading factor (0, 1, 2, 3,4, 5, 6/7); second column lists the corresponding values for the b value in dB (0, -1, -2, -3, -4, -6, -9, -infinity), respectively. For other<br>

BSSi, the WT attempts to receive bi from the uplink loading factor sent in the downlink broadcast system subchannel of the BSS i in the tone block of the current connection. If the WT is unable to receive the UL loading factor bi, the WT sets bi = 1.<br>
[00153]      In some embodiments, in the single carrier operation, the WT calculates the following power ratio as the generic beacon ratio report: bo/(G1b1 + G2b2 + ...) when ulUItraslotBeaconslot Index is even or b0/max(Gibi, G2D2,...) when ulUltraslotBeaconslotindex is odd, where ulUltraslotBeaconslotlndex is the uplink index of the beaconslot within the ultraslot of the current connection and the operation + represents a regular addition. When required to send a specific beacon ratio report, the WT, in some embodiments, calculates bo/(GkBk), where index k represents the specific BSS k. In some embodiments, there are 18 indexed beaconslots within an ultraslot.<br>
[00154]      Figure 29 is a table 2900 illustrating an exemplary format for a 4 bit downlink beacon ratio report (DLBNR4), in accordance with various embodiments. First column 2902 lists the 16 various bit patterns that the report can convey, while second column 2904 lists the reported power ratio reported corresponding to each bit pattern, e.g., ranging from -3dB to 26dBs. The wireless terminal reports the generic and specific beacon ratio reports by selecting and communicating the DLBNR4 table entry that is closed to the determined report value. Although in this exemplary embodiment, the generic and specific beacon ratio reports use the same table for DLBNR4, in some embodiments, different tables may be used.<br>
[00155]      An exemplary 4 bit saturation level of downlink self-noise SNR report (DLSSNR4) will now be described. In some embodiments, the WT derives the saturation level of the DL SNR, which is defined to be the DL SNR that the WT receiver would measure on a received signal if the BSS transmitted the signal at infinite power, if the base station were capable of transmitting such a signal and the wireless terminal was capable of measuring such a signal. The saturation level can be, and in some embodiments is, determined by the self-noise of the WT receiver, which may be caused by factor such as channel estimation errors. The following is an exemplary method to derive the saturation level of the DL SNR.<br>
SUBSTITUTE SHEET (RULE 26)<br><br><br>
WO 2007/075773<br><br>
PCT/US2006/048584<br><br>
[00156]      In the exemplary method, the WT assumes that if the BSS transmits at power P, the DL SNR is equal to SNR(P) = GP/(a0,GP + N), where G represent the wireless channel path gain from the BSS to the WT, P is the transmission power, so that GP is the received signal power, N represents the received interference power, aoGP represents the self-noise, where a higher value of ao denotes a higher value of self-noise. G is a value between 0 and 1, ao, P, and N are positive values. In this model, by definition, the saturation level of the DL SNR is equal to 1/ao. In some embodiments, the WT measures the received power of a downlink Null channel (DL.NCH) to determine the interference power N, measures the received power (denoted as G*Po) of the downlink pilot channel and SNR (denoted by SNRo) of the downlink pilot channel; the WT then calculates 1/ao = (1/SNRo - N/CGPo))-1<br>
[00157]      Once the WT has derived the saturation level of the DL SNR, the WT reports it by using the closest entry to the derived value in a DL self-noise saturation level report table. Table 3000 of Figure 30 is such an exemplary table describing the format of DLSSNR4. First column 3002 indicates the 16 different possible bit patterns that can be conveyed by the DLSSNR4 report, and second column 3004 lists saturation levels of DL SNR that are communicated corresponding to each bit pattern ranging from 8.75dB to 29.75 dBs.<br>
[00158]      In various embodiments, a flexible report is included in the DCCH, such that the WT decides which type of report to communicate and, the type of report can change from one flexible reporting opportunity to the next for a given WT using its allocated dedicated control channel segments.<br>
[00159]      In an exemplary embodiment, the WT uses a 2 bit type report (TYPE2) to indicate the type of report selected by the WT to be communicated in a 4 bit body report (BODY4) of the same DCCH segment including both the TYPE2 and BODY4 reports. Table 3100 of Figure 31 is an example of mapping between TYPE2 report information bits and the type of report carried by the corresponding BODY4 report. First column 3102 indicates the four possible bit patterns for the 2 bit TYPE2 report. Second column 3104 indicates the type of report to be carried in the BODY4 report of the same uplink dedicated control channel segment corresponding to the TYPE2 report.<br>
SUBSTITUTE SHEET (RULE 26)<br><br><br>

Table 3100 indicates that: bit pattern 00 indicates that B0DY4 report will be an ULRQST4 report, Bit pattern 01 indicates the BODY4 report will be a DLSSNR4 report, and bit patterns 10 and 11 are reserved.<br>
[00160]      In some embodiments, a WT selects the TYPE2 and BODY4 reports by assessing the relative importance of the different types of reports from among which the selection may occur, e.g., the reports listed in table 3100. In some embodiments, the WT can select the TYPE2 independently from one segment to another.<br>
[00161]      Figure 32 is a drawing 3299 illustrating an exemplary default mode of the split tone format in a beaconslot for a given DCCH tone for a first WT. In Figure 32, each block (3200, 3201,3202, 3203 3204, 3205, 3206, 3207,3208, 3209, 3210, 3211, 3212, 3213, 3214, 3215, 3216, 3217, 3218, 3219, 3220,3221, 3222, 3223, 3224, 3225, 3226, 3227, 3228, 3229, 3230,3231, 3232, 3323, 3234, 3235, 3236, 3237, 3238, 3239) represents one segment whose index s2 (0,..., 39) is shown above the block in rectangular region 3240. Each block, e.g., block 3200 representing segment 0, conveys 8 information bits; each block comprises 8 rows corresponding to the 8 bits in the segment, where the bits are listed from the most significant bit to the least significant bit downwards from the top row to the bottom row as shown in rectangular region 3243.<br>
[00162]      For an exemplary embodiment, the framing format shown in Figure 32 is used repeatedly in every beaconslot, when the default mode of split-tone format is used, with the following exception. In the first uplink superslot after the wireless terminal migrates to the ON state in the current connection, the WT shall use the framing format shown in Figure 33. The first uplink superslot is defined: for a scenano when the WT migrates to the ON state from the ACCESS state, for a scenario when the WT migrates to the ON state from a HOLD state, and for a scenario when the WT migrates to the ON state from the ON state of another connection.<br>
[00163]      Figure 33 illustrates an exemplary definition of the default mode in the split-tone format of the uplink DCCH segments in the first uplink superslot after the WT migrates to the ON state. Drawing 3399 includes five successive segments (3300, 3301, 3302, 3303, 3304) corresponding to segment index numbers, s2 = (0, 1, 2, 3,4,),<br>

respectively in the superslot as indicated by rectangle 3306 above the segments. Each block, e.g., block 3300 representing segment 0 of the superslot, conveys 8 information bits; each block comprises 8 rows corresponding to the 8 bits in the segment, where the bits are listed from the most significant bit to the least significant bit downwards from the top row to the bottom row as shown in rectangular region 3308.<br>
[00164]      In the exemplary embodiment, in the scenario of migrating from the HOLD to ON state, the WT starts to transmit the uplink DCCH channel from the beginning of the first UL superslot, and therefore the first uplink DCCH segment shall transport the information bits in the leftmost information column of Figure 33, the information bits of segment 3300. In the exemplary embodiment, in the scenario of migrating from the ACCESS state to the ON state, the WT does not necessarily start from the beginning of the first UL superslot, but does still transmit the uplink DCCH segments according to the framing format specified in Figure 33. For example, if the WT starts to transmit the UL DCCH segments from the halfslot of the superslot with index =10, then the WT skips the leftmost information column of Figure 33 (segment 3300) and the first uplink segment transported corresponds to segment 3303). Note that in the exemplary embodiment, superlsot indexed halfslots (1-3) correspond to one segment and superslot indexed halfslots (10-12) correspond to the next segment for the WT. In the exemplary embodiment, for the scenario of switching between the full-tone and split-tone formats, the WT uses the framing format shown in Figure 32 without the above exception of using the format shown in Figure 33.<br>
[00165]      Once, the first UL superslot ends, the uplink DCCH channel segments switch to the framing format of Figure 32. Depending on where the first uplink superslot ends, the point of switching the framing format may or may not be the beginning of a beaconslot. Note that in this exemplary embodiment, there are five DCCH segments for a given DCCH tone for a superslot. For example, suppose that the first uplink superslot is of uplink beaconslot superslot index =2, where beaconslot superslot index range is from 0 to 7 (superslot 0, superlot 1,..., superslot 7). Subsequently in the next uplink superslot, which is of uplink beaconslot superslot index = 3, the first uplink DCCH segment using the default framing format of Figure 32 is of<br>

index s2-15 (segment 3215 of Figure 32) and transports the information corresponding to segment s2=15 (segment 3215 of Figure 32).<br>
[00166]      Each uplink DCCH segment is used to transmit a set of Dedicated Control Channel Reports (DCRs). An exemplary summary list of DCRs in the split-tone format for the default mode is given in table 3400 Figure 34. The information of table 3400 is applicable to the partitioned segments of Figures 32 and 33. Each segment of Figure 32 and 33 includes two or more reports as described in table 3400. First column 3402 of table 3400 describes abbreviated names used for each exemplary report. The name of each report ends with a number which specifies the number of bits of the DCR. Second column 3404 of table 3400 briefly describes each named report. Third column 3406 specifies the segment index s2 of Figure 32, in which a DCR is to be transmitted, and corresponds to a mapping between table 3400 and Figure 32.<br>
[00167]      It should be noted that Figures 32, 33 and 34 describe the segments (indexed segments 0,3, 6, 9, 12,15, 18,21,24, 27, 30, 33, and 36) corresponding to a first WT in split tone format for default mode. With respect to Figure 32, a second wireless terminal that use the split tone format of default mode on the same logical tone in the DCCH will follow the same report pattern but the segments will be shifted by one, thus the second WT uses indexed segments (1,4, 7, 10, 13, 16, 19, 22,25, 28, 31, 34, and 37). With respect to Figure 33, a second wireless terminal that use the split tone format of default mode on the same logical tone in the DCCH will follow the same report pattern but the segments will be shifted by one, thus the second WT uses indexed segments 3301 and 3304. With respect to Figure 32, a third wireless terminal that use the split tone format of default mode on the same logical tone in the DCCH will follow the same report pattern but the segments will be shifted by two, thus the third WT uses indexed segments (2, 5, 8, 11, 14, 17, 20, 23, 26, 29, 33, 35, and 38). With respect to Figure 33, a third wireless terminal that use the split tone format of default mode on the same logical tone in the DCCH will follow the same report pattern but the segments will be shifted by two, thus the third WT uses indexed segments 3305. In Figure 32, segment with index = 39 is reserved.<br>

[00168]      Figure 33 provides a representation corresponding to the replacement of the first superslot of a beaconslot corresponding to table 3299, e.g., segment 3300 replaces segment 3200 and/or segment 3303 replaces segment 3203. In Figure 32, for each superslot, one or two segments are allocated to an exemplary wireless terminal using split-tone DCCH format, and the location of the allocated segments varies depending on the superslot of the beaconslot. For example, in the first superslot, two segments (3200, 3203) are allocated corresponding to the first and fourth DCCH segments of the superslots; in the second superslot, two segments (3206, 3209) are allocated corresponding to the 2nd and 5th DCCH segments of the superslot; in the third superslot, one segment 3213 is allocated corresponding to the third DCCH segment of the superslot In some embodiments, segment 3300, when used, is used to replace the first scheduled DCCH segment of a superslot and segment 3303, when used, is used to replace the second scheduled DCCH segment of a superslot For example, segment 3300 may replace segment 3206 and/or segment 3303 may replace segment 3309. As another example, segment 3300 may replace segment 3212.<br>
[00169]      In some embodiments, the 5 bit absolute report of DL SNR (DLSNR5) follows the same format in split-tone format default mode as used in the full-tone format default mode. In some such embodiments, there is an exception such that the default value of NumConsecutivePreferred is different in the split-tone format than in the full-tone format, e.g., 6 in the split tone format default mode vs 10 in the full tone format default mode.<br>
[00170]      In some embodiments, the 3 bit DLDSNR3 report follows the same format in the split-tone format default mode as used in the full-tone format default mode. In some embodiments, the 4 bit DLSSNR4 report follows the same format in the split-tone format default mode as used in the full-tone format default mode.<br>
[00171]      In some embodiments, the 4 bit uplink transmission backoff report (ULTxBKF4) of the split tone format default mode is generated similarly to the ULTxBKFS of full tone format default mode, except table 3500 of Figure 35 is used for the report.<br>

[00172]     Figure 35 is a table 3500 identifying bit format and interpretations associated with each of 16 bit patterns for an exemplary 4 bit uplink transmission backoff report (ULTxBKF4), in accordance with various embodiments. First column 3502 identifies the bit pattern and bit ordering, most significant bit to least significant bit Second column 3504 identifies the reported WT uplink DCCH Backoff report values in dBs corresponding to each bit pattern each bit pattern. In this exemplary embodiment 16 distinct levels can be reported ranging from 6dB to 36dBs. A wireless terminal calculates wtULDCCHBackoff, e.g., as indicated above, selects the closest entry in table 3500 and uses that bit pattern for the report.<br>
[00173]      In some embodiments, the 4 bit DLBNR4 report follows the same format in the split-tone format default mode as used in the full-tone format default mode. In some embodiments, the 3 bit ULRQST3 report follows the same format in the split-tone format default mode as used in the full-tone fonnat default mode. In some embodiments, the 4 bit ULRQST4 report follows the same fonnat in the split-tone format default mode as used in the full-tone fonnat default mode.<br>
[00174]      In various embodiments, a flexible report is included in the DCCH in the split-tone format in the default mode, such that the WT decides which type of report to communicate and, the type of report can change from one flexible reporting opportunity to the next for a given WT using its allocated dedicated control channel segments:<br>
[00175]      In an exemplary embodiment, the WT uses a I bit type report (TYPE1) to indicate the type of report selected by the WT to be communicated in a 4 bit body report (BODY4) of the same DCCH segment including both the TYPE I and BODY4 reports. Table 3600 of Figure 36 is an example of mapping between TYPE1 report information bits and the type of report carried by the corresponding BODY4 report. First column 3602 indicates the two possible bit patterns for the 1 bit TYPE1 report. Second column 3604 indicates the type of report to be carried in the BODY4 report of the same uplink dedicated control channel segment corresponding to the TYPE1 report. Table 3600 indicates that: bit pattern 0 indicates that BODY4 report will be an ULRQST4 report, Bit pattern 01 indicates the BODY4 report will be a Reserved report.<br>

[00176]      In some embodiments, a WT selects the TYPE1 and BODY4 reports by assessing the relative importance if the different types of reports from among which the selection may occur, e.g., the reports listed in table 3600. In some embodiments, the WT can select the TYP£1 independently from one segment to another.<br>
[00177]      In some embodiments, the encoding and modulation scheme used when the uplink dedicated control channel segment uses the full-tone format is different than the encoding and modulation scheme used when the uplink dedicated control channel segment uses the split-tone format.<br>
[00178]      An exemplary first method used for encoding and modulation when the dedicated control channel segment uses the full-tone format will now be described. Let b5, b4, b3, b2, b1, and bo denote the information bits to be transmitted in the uplink dedicated control channel segment, where b5 is the most significant bit and bo is the least significant bit. Define C2C1C0 = (b5b4b3)^(b2b1bo), where .^ is a bit-wise logical OR operation. The WT determines a group of seven modulation-symbols from information bit groups b5b4b3 according to Table 3700 of Figure 37. Table 3700 is an exemplary specification of uplink dedicated control channel segment modulation coding in full-tone format. First column 3702 of table 3700 includes bit patterns for 3 ordered information bits; second column 3704 includes corresponding sets of seven ordered coded modulation symbols, each set corresponding to a different possible bit pattern.<br>
[00179]      The seven modulation-symbols determined from b5b4b3 are to be the seven most significant coded modulation-symbols of the output of the coding and modulation operation.<br>
[0018O]      The WT determines a group of seven modulation-symbols from information bit groups b2 b1 bo similarly using table 3700, and uses the seven modulation-symbols obtained as the next most significant coded modulation-symbols of the output of the encoding and modulation operation.<br>

[00182]       An exemplary second method used for encoding and modulation when the dedicated control channel segment uses the split-tone format will now be described. Let b7, b6, b5, b4, b3, b2, b1, and b0 denote the information bits to be transmitted in the uplink dedicated control channel segment, where b7 is the most significant bit and bo is the least significant bit. Define C3C2c1co = (b7b6b5b4)^(b3b2b1bo), where ^ is a bit-wise logical OR operation. The WT determines a group of seven modulation-symbols from information bit groups b7b6b5b4 according to Table 3800 of Figure 38. Table 3800 is an exemplary specification of uplink dedicated control channel segment modulation coding in split-tone format. First column 3802 of table 3800 includes bit patterns for4 ordered information bits; second column 3804 includes corresponding sets of seven ordered coded modulation symbols, each set corresponding to a different possible bit pattern.<br>
[00183]      The seven modulation-symbols determined from b7b6b5b4 are to be the seven most significant coded modulation-symbols of the output of the coding and modulation operation.<br>
[00184]      The WT determines a group of seven modulation-symbols from information bit groups b3b2 b1bo similarly using table 3800, and uses the seven modulation-symbols obtained as the next most significant coded modulation-symbols of the output of the encoding and modulation operation.<br>
[00185]      The WT determines a group of seven modulation-symbols from information bit groups C3C2C1C0 similarly using table 3800, and uses the seven modulation-symbols obtained as the least significant coded modulation-symbols of the output of the coding and modulation operation.<br>

First column 3902 lists queue element index, and second column 3904 lists queue element value. First row 3906 indicates that N[0] = the number of MAC frames that the WT intends to transmit for request group 0 (RG0); second row 3908 indicates that N[l J = the number of MAC frames that the WT intends to transmit for request group I (RGl); third row indicates that N[2] = the number of MAC frames that the WT intends to transmit for request group 2; fourth row 3912 indicates that N[3] = the number of MAC frames that the WT intends to transmit for request group 3.<br>

Queue 0 4002 is the queue for request group 0 information. Queue 0 information 4002 includes a count of the total number of frames, e.g., MAC frames, of queue 0 traffic (N[0]) that the WT intends to transmit 4010 and the corresponding frames of uplink traffic (frame 1 4012, frame 2,4014, frame 3 4016,..., frame No 4018). Queue I 4004 is the queue for request group 1 information. Queue 1 information 4004 includes a count of the total number of frames, e.g., MAC frames, of queue 1 traffic (N[l]) that the WT intends to transmit 4020 and the corresponding frames of uplink traffic (frame I 4022, frame 2,4024, frame 3 4026, ..., frame N1 4028). Queue 2 4006 is the queue for request group 2 information. Queue 2 information 4006 includes a count of the total number of frames, e.g., MAC frames, of queue 2 traffic (N[2]) that the WT intends to transmit 4030 and the corresponding frames of uplink traffic (frame 1 4032, frame 2, 4034, frame 3 4036,.... frame N2 4038). Queue 3 4008 is the queue for request group 3 information. Queue 3 information 4008 includes a count of the total number of frames, e.g., MAC frames, of queue 3 traffic (N[3]) that the WT intends to transmit 4040 and the corresponding frames of uplink<br>
traffic (frame 1 4042, frame 2,4044, frame 3 4046	frame N3 4048). In some<br>
embodiments, the request queues, for at least some wireless terminals, are priority queues. For example, in some embodiments, request group 0 queue 4002 is used for the highest priority traffic, request group 1 queue 4004 is used for the 2nd highest priority traffic, request group 2 queue 4006 is used for the third highest priority traffic, and<br>

request group 3 queue 4008 is used for the lowest priority traffic, from the perspective of the individual wireless terminal.<br>
[00188]      In some embodiments, the traffic in at least some request queues during at least some times for at least some wireless terminals have different priorities. In some embodiments, priority is one factor considered when mapping a traffic flow to a request queue. In some embodiments, priority is one factor considered when scheduling/transmitting traffic. In some embodiments, priority is representative of relative importance. In some embodiments, all other factors being equal, traffic belonging to a higher priority is scheduled/transmitted more often than traffic belonging to lower priorities.<br>
[00189]      Drawing 4052 of Figure 40 illustrates exemplary mapping for a first WT, WT A, of uplink data stream traffic flows to its request group queues. First column 4054 includes information type of the data stream traffic flow; second column 4056 includes the identified queue (request group); third column 4058 includes comments. First row 4060 indicates that control information is mapped to request group 0 queue. Flows mapped to the request group 0 queue are considered high priority, have strict latency requirements, require low latency and/or have low bandwidth requirements. Second row 4062 indicates that voice information is mapped to request group 1 queue. Flows mapped to the request group 1 queue also require low latency but have a lower priority level than request group 0. Third row 4064 indicates that gaming and audio stream application A is mapped to request group 2 queue. For flows mapped to the request group 2, latency is somewhat important and the bandwidth requirements are slightly higher than for voice. Fourth row 4066 indicates that FTP, web browsing, and video stream application A are mapped to request group 3 queue. Flows mapped to the request group 3, are delay insensitive and/or require high bandwidth.<br>
[00190]      Drawing 4072 of Figure 40 illustrates exemplary mapping for a second WT, WTB, of uplink data stream traffic flows to its request group queues. First column 4074 includes information type of the data stream traffic flow; second column 4076 includes the identified queue (request group); third column 4078 includes comments. First row 4080 indicates that control information is mapped to request group 0 queue.<br>

Flows mapped to the request group 0 queue are considered high priority, have strict latency requirements, require low latency and/or have low bandwidth requirements. Second row 4082 indicates that voice and audio stream application A information are mapped to request group 1 queue. Flows mapped to the request group I queue also require low latency but have a lower priority level than request group 0. Third row 4084 indicates that gaming and audio stream application B, and image stream application A are mapped to request group 2 queue. For flows mapped to the request group 2, latency is somewhat important and the bandwidth requirements are slightly higher than for voice. Fourth row 4086 indicates that FTP, web browsing, and image stream application B are mapped to request group 3 queue. Flows mapped to the request group 3, are delay insensitive and/or require high bandwidth.<br>
[00191]      It should be noted the WT A and WT B use different mapping from their uplink data stream traffic flows to their set of request group queues. For example audio stream application A is mapped to request group queue 2 for WTA, while the same audio stream application A is mapped to request group queue 1 for WTB. In addition, different WTs may have different types of uplink data stream traffic flows. For example, WT B includes an audio stream application B that is not included for WT A. This approach, in accordance with various embodiments, allows each WT to customize and/or optimize its request queue mapping to match the different types of data being communicated via its uplink traffic channel segments. For example, a mobile node such as a voice and text message cell phone has different types of data streams than a mobile data terminal used primarily for on-line gaming and web browsing, and would typically have a different mapping of data streams to request group queues.<br>
[00192]      In some embodiments, the mapping from uplink data stream traffic flows to request group queues for a WT may change with time. Drawing 4001 of Figure 40A illustrates exemplary mapping for a WT C at a first time Tl, of uplink data stream traffic flows to its request group queues. First column 4003 includes information type of the data stream traffic flow; second column 4005 includes the identified queue (request group); third column 4007 includes comments.

latency and/or have low bandwidth requirements. Second row 4011 indicates that voice information is mapped to request group 1 queue. Flows mapped to the request group 1 queue also require low latency but have a lower priority level than request group 0. Third row 4013 indicates that gaming and audio stream application A is mapped to request group 2 queue. For flows mapped to the request group 2, latency is somewhat important and the bandwidth requirements are slightly higher than for voice. Fourth row 4015 indicates that FTP, web browsing, and video stream application A are mapped to request group 3 queue. Flows mapped to the request group 3, are delay insensitive and/or require high bandwidth.<br>
[00193]      Drawing 4017 of Figure 40A illustrates exemplary mapping for a WT C at a second time T2, of uplink data stream traffic flows to its request group queues.  First column 4019 includes information type of the data stream traffic flow; second column 4021 includes the identified queue (request group); third column 4023 includes comments. First row 4025 indicates that control information is mapped to request group 0 queue. Flows mapped to the request group 0 queue are considered high priority, have strict latency requirements, require low latency and/or have low bandwidth requirements. Second row 4027 indicates that voice application and a gaming application is mapped to request group 1 queue. Flows mapped to the request group 1 queue also require low latency but have a lower priority level than request group 0. Third row 4029 indicates that video streaming application A is mapped to request group 2 queue. For flows mapped to the request group 2, latency is somewhat important and the bandwidth requirements are slightly higher than for voice. Fourth row 4031 indicates that FTP, web browsing and video streaming application B are mapped to request group 3 queue. Flows mapped to the request group 3, are delay insensitive and/or require high bandwidth.<br>
[00194)      Drawing 4033 of Figure 73 illustrates exemplary mapping for a WT C at a third time T3, of uplink data stream traffic flows to its request group queues. First column 4035 includes information type of the data stream traffic flow; second column 4037 includes the identified queue (request group); third column 4039 includes comments. First row 4041 indicates that control information is mapped to request group 0 queue. Flows mapped to the request group 0 queue are considered high priority, have<br>

strict latency requirements, require low latency and/or have low bandwidth requirements. Second row 4043 and third row 4045 indicate that no data traffic applications are mapped to request group 1 and request group 2 queues, respectively. Fourth row 4047 indicates that FTP and web browsing are mapped to request group 3 queue. Flows mapped to the request group 3, are delay insensitive and/or require high bandwidth.<br>
[00195]      It should be noted WT C uses different mappings from their uplink data stream traffic flows to their set of request group queues at the three times Tl, T2 and T3. For example audio stream application A is mapped to request group queue 2 at time T1, while the same audio stream application A is mapped to request group queue 1 at time T2. In addition, the WT may have different types of uplink data stream traffic flows at different times. For example, at time T2, the WT includes a video stream application B that is not included at time Tl. In addition, the WT may have no uplink data stream traffic flows mapped to a specific request group queue at a given time. For example, at time T3, there are no uplink data stream traffic flows that are mapped to request group queues 1 and 2. This approach, in accordance with various embodiments, allows each WT to customize and/or optimize its request queue mapping to match the different types of data being communicated via its uplink traffic channel segments at any time.<br>
[00196]      Figure 41 illustrates an exemplary request group queue structure, multiple request dictionaries, a plurality of types of uplink traffic channel request reports, and grouping of sets of queues in accordance with exemplary formats used for each of the types of reports. In this exemplary embodiment, there are four request group queues for a given wireless terminal. The exemplary structure accommodates four request dictionaries. The exemplary structure uses three types of uplink traffic channel request reports (a 1 bit report, a 3-bit report, and a 4-bit report).<br>
|00.197]      Figure 41 includes: exemplary queue 0 (request group 0) information 4102 which includes the total number of frames, e.g., MAC frames, of queue 0 traffic that an exemplary WT intends to transmit (N[0]) 4110, exemplary queue 1 (request group 1) information 4104 which includes the total number of frames, e.g., MAC<br>

frames, of queue I traffic that an exemplary WT intends to transmit (N[l]) 4112, exemplary queue 2 (request group 2) information 4106 which includes the total number of frames, e.g., MAC frames, of queue 2 traffic that an exemplary WT intends to transmit (N[2]) 4114, and exemplary queue 3 (request group 3) information 4108 which includes the total number of frames, e.g., MAC frames, of queue 3 traffic that an exemplary WT intends to transmit (N[3]) 4116. The set of queue 0 info 4102, queue 1 info 4104, queue 2 info 4106 and queue 3 info 4108 correspond to one WT in the system. Each WT in the system maintains its set of queues, tracking uplink traffic frames mat it may intend to transmit.<br>
[00198]      Table 4118 identifies grouping of queue sets used by different types of request reports as a function of the dictionary in use. Column 4120 identifies the dictionary. The first type of exemplary report is, e.g., a \ bit information report. Column 4122 identifies the first set of queues used for first type reports. The first set of queues is the set {queue 0 and queue 1} for the first type of report irrespective of the request dictionary. Column 4124 identifies the second set of queues used for second type reports. The second set of queues is the set {queue 0} for the second type of report irrespective of the request dictionary. Column 4126 identifies the third set of queues used for second type reports. The third set of queues is: (i) the set {queue I, queue 2, queue 3} for the second type of report for request dictionary 0, (ii) the set of {queue 2} for the second type of report for request dictionary I, and (in) the set of {queue 1} for the second type of report for dictionary 2 and 3. The third type of report uses a fourth and fifth set of queues for each dictionary. The third type of report.uses a sixth set of queues for dictionaries 1, 2, and 3. The third type of report uses a seventh set of queues for dictionary 3. Column 4128 identifies that the fourth set of queues for the third type of report is the set {queue 0} irrespective of the dictionary. Column 4130 identifies that die fifth set of queues for the third type of report is the set {queue 1, queue 2, queue 3} for dictionary 0, the set {queue 2} for dictionary 1, the set {queue 1} for dictionaries 2 and 3. Column 4132 identifies that the sixth set of queues for the third type of report is<br>
and the set {queue 2} for dictionary 3. Column 4134 identifies that the seventh set of queues for the third type of report is the set {queue 3} for dictionary 3.<br>

[00199]      As an example, the (first, second, and third) types of reports may be the exemplary (ULRQSTI, ULRQST3, and ULRQST4) reports, respectively, of Figures 16-25. The sets of queues used (See table 4118) will be described with respect to the dictionary 0 for the exemplary ULRQSTI, ULRQST3, and ULRQST 4. First set of queues {queue 0, queue 1} corresponds to ULRQSTI using N[0] + N[1] in table 1600, e.g., an ULRQST 1 = 1 indicates that N[0]+N[1]&gt;0.   Queue stats of second set of queues {queue 0} and third set of queues {queue I, queue 2, queue 3} are jointly coded in an ULRQST3. Second set of queues {queue 0} corresponds to an ULRQST3 which uses N[0] as the first jointly coded element in table 1900, e.g., an ULRQST3 = 001 indicates N[0]=0. Third set of queues {queue I, queue 2, queue 3} corresponds to an ULRQST3 which uses (N[l]+N[2]+N[3]) as the second jointly coded element in table 1900, e.g., an ULRQST3 = 001 indicates ceil((N[l] + N[2] + N[3])/y) = 1. Queue stats of fourth set of queues (queue 0} or the fifth set of queues {queue 1, queue 2, queue 3} are coded in an ULRQST4. The fourth set of queues corresponds to ULRQST4 using N[0] in table 1800, e.g., an ULRQST4= 0010 indicates that N{0] &gt;=4. The fifth set of queues corresponds to ULRQST4 using N[l] + N[2] + N[3] in table 1800, e.g., an ULRQST4 = 0011 indicates ceiI((N[l] + N[2] + N[3])/y) = 1.<br>
[00200]      In the exemplary embodiment where (first type, second, and third) types of reports are the exemplary (ULRQSTI, ULRQST3, and ULRQST4) reports of Figures 16-25, the first type of report is independent of request dictionary and uses the first set of queues of table 4118, a second type of report communicates queue stat information about both a second set of queues and a corresponding third set of queues from table 4118, and a third type of report communicates queue stat information about one of: a fourth sets of queues, a corresponding fifth set of queues, a corresponding sixth set of queues, and a corresponding seventh set of queues.<br>
[00201]      Figure 42, comprising the combination of Figure 42A, Figure 42B, Figure 42C, Figure 42D, and Figure 42E is a flowchart 4200 of an exemplary method of operating a wireless terminal in accordance with various embodiments. Operation of the exemplary method starts in step 4202, where the WT is powered on and initialized. Queue definition information 4204, e.g., mapping information defining mapping of traffic flows from various applications into MAC frames of specific request group<br>
SUBSTITUTE SHEET (RULE 26)<br><br><br>
WO 2007/075773<br><br>
PCT/US2006/048584<br><br>
queues and various grouping of request groups into sets of request groups, and sets of request dictionary information 4206 are available for use by the wireless terminal. For example, the information 4204 and 4206 may be pre-stored in the wireless terminal in non-volatile memory. In some embodiments, a default request dictionary from among the plurality of available request dictionaries is used by the wireless terminal initially, e.g., request dictionary 0. Operation proceeds from start step 4202 to steps 4208,4210 and 4212.<br>
[00202]      In step 4208 the wireless terminal maintains transmission queue stats for a plurality of queues, e.g., request group 0 queue, request group 1 queue, request group 2 queue and request group 3 queue. Step 4208 includes sub-step 4214 and sub-step 4216. In sub-step 4214, the wireless terminal increments queue stats when data to be transmitted is added to a queue. For example, new packets from an uplink data stream flow, e.g., a voice communications session flow, are mapped as MAC frames to one of the request groups, e.g., request group 1 queue and a queue stat, e.g., N[l] representing the total number of request group 1 frames that the WT intends to transmit is updated. In some embodiments, different wireless terminals use different mappings. In sub-step 4216, the WT decrements the queue stats when data to be transmitted is removed from a queue. For example, the data to be transmitted may be removed from the queue because the data has been transmitted, the data has been transmitted and a positive acknowledgement was received, the data no longer needs to be transmitted because a data validity timer has expired, or the data no longer needs to be transmitted because the communications session has been terminated.<br>
[00203]      In step 4210, the wireless terminal generates transmission power availability information. For example, the wireless terminal calculates the wireless terminal transmission backoff power, determines a wireless terminal transmission backoff power report value, and stores backoff power information. Step 4210 is performed on an ongoing basis with the stored information being updated, e.g., in accordance with a DCCH structure.<br>
[00204]      in step 4212, the wireless terminal generates transmission path loss information for at least two physical attachment points. For example, the wireless<br>

WO 2007/075773<br><br>
PCT/US2006/048584<br><br>
terminal measures received pilot and/or beacon signals from at least two physical attachment points calculates a ratio value, determines a beacon ratio report value, e.g., corresponding to a generic beacon ratio report of a first or second type or a specific beacon ratio report, and stores the beacon ratio report information. Step 4212 is performed on an ongoing basis with the stored information being updated, e.g. in accordance with a DCCH structure.<br>
(00205]      In addition to performing step 4208,4210 and 4212, the WT, for each reporting opportunity in a (first, second, third) set of predetermined transmission queue stats reporting opportunities operation goes to (sub-routine 1 4224, sub-routine 2 4238, subroutine 3 4256), via (step 4218, step 4220, step 4222), respectively. For example, each first set of predetermined transmission queue stat reporting opportunities corresponds to each one-bit uplink traffic channel request reporting opportunity in the timing structure. For example, if a WT is communicating over DCCH segments using the full-tone DCCH format default mode, e.g., of Figure 10, the WT receives 16 opportunities to send ULRQST1 in a beaconslot. Continuing with the example, each second set of predetermined transmission queue stat reporting opportunities corresponds to each three-bit uplink traffic channel request reporting opportunity in the timing structure. For example, if a WT is communicating over DCCH segments using the full-tone DCCH format default mode, e.g., of Figure 10, the WT receives 12 opportunities to send ULRQST3 in a beaconslot. If a WT is communicating over DCCH segments using the split-tone DCCH format default mode, e.g., of Figure 32, the WT receives 6 opportunities to send ULRQST3 in a beaconslot. Continuing with the example, each third set of predetermined transmission queue stat reporting opportunities corresponds to each four-bit uplink traffic channel request reporting opportunity in the timing structure. For example, if a WT is communicating over DCCH segments using the full-tone DCCH format default mode, e.g., of Figure 10, the WT receives 9 opportunities to send ULRQST4 in a beaconslot. If a WT is communicating over DCCH segments using the split-tone DCCH format default mode, e.g., of Figure 32, the WT receives 6 opportunities to send ULRQST4 in a beaconslot. For each flexible report in which the WT decides to send an ULRQST4, operation also goes to sub-routine 4256 via connecting node 4222.<br>

[00206]      Exemplary traffic availability subroutine I 4224 will now be described. Operation starts in step 4226, and the WT receives backlog information for a first set of queues, e.g. the set of {Queue 0, Queue 1} where the information received is N[0] + N[ I J. Operation proceeds from step 4226 to step 4230.<br>
100207]      In step 4230, the WT checks if there is a backlog of traffic in the first set of queues. If there is no backlog in the first set of queues, N[0] + N[l] = 0, then operation proceeds from step 4230 to step 4234, where the WT transmits a first number of information bits, e.g., 1 information bit, indicating no traffic backlog in the first set of queues, e.g. the information bit is set equal to 0. Alternatively, if there is a backlog in the first set of queues, N[0] +N[1] &gt;0, then operation proceeds from step 4230 to step 4232, where the WT transmits a first number of information bits, e.g., 1 information bit, indicating a traffic backlog in the first set of queues, e.g. the information bit is set equal to 1. Operation proceeds from either step 4232 or step 4234 to return step 4236.<br>
[00208]      Exemplary traffic availability subroutine 2 423$ will now be described. Operation starts in step 4240, and the WT receives backlog information for a second set of queues, e.g. the set of {Queue 0} where the information received is N[0]. In step 4240, the WT also receives backlog information for a third set of queues, e.g.; the set {queue 1, queue2, queue3} or {queue 2} or {queue 1} depending on the request dictionary in use by the WT. For example, corresponding to dictionary (1,2, 3,4), the WT may receive (N[l] +N[2] + N[3], N[2], N[l], N[l}), respectively. Operation proceeds from step 4240 to step 4246.<br>
100209]      In step 4246, the WT jointly encodes the backlog information corresponding to the second and third sets of queues into a second predetermined number of information bits, e.g., 3, said joint encoding optionally including quantization. In some embodiments, for at least some request dictionaries sub-step 4248 and sub-step 4250 are performed as part of step 4246. In some embodiments, for at least some request dictionaries for at least some iterations of step 4246, sub-step 4248 and sub-step 4250 are performed as part of step 4246. Sub-step 4248 directs operation to a quantization level control factor subroutine. Sub-step 4250 calculates a quantization level as a function of a determined control factor. For example, consider<br>
SUBSTITUTE SHEET (RULE 26)<br>
  WO 2007/075773<br><br>
PCT/US2006/048584<br><br>
exemplary ULRQST3 using default request dictionary 0 as shown in Figure 19. In that exemplary case each of the quantization levels are calculated as a function of control factor y. In such an exemplary embodiment, sub-steps 4248 and 4250 are performed in determining the information bit pattern to place in the ULRQST3 report. Alternatively, consider exemplary ULRQST3 using request dictionary 1 as shown in Figure 21. In that case, none of the quantization levels are calculated as a function of a control factor, e.g. y or z, and therefore sub-step 4248 and 4250 are not performed.<br>
[00210]      Operation proceeds from step 4246 to step 4252, where the WT transmits the jointly coded backlog information for the second and third sets of queues using the second predetermined number of information bits, e.g., 3 information bits. Operation proceeds from step 4252 to return step 4254.<br>
[00211]-     Exemplary traffic availability subroutine 3 4256 will now be described. Operation starts in step 4258, and the WT receives backlog information for a fourth set of queues, e.g. the set of {Queue 0} where the information received is N[0]. In step 4240, the WT also receives backlog information for a Fifth set of queues, e.g., the set {queue 1, queue2, queue3} or {queue 2} or {queue 1} depending on the request dictionary in use by the WT, For example, corresponding to dictionary (0,1, 2, 3), the WT may receive (N[l] + N[2] + N[3],N[2], N[l], N[l]), respectively. In step 4240, the WT may also receives backlog information for a sixth set of queues, e.g., the set {queue 1, queue3&gt; or {queue 2, queue3} or {queue 2} depending on the request dictionary in use by the WT. For example, corresponding- to dictionary (1,2,3), the WT may receive (N[l] + N[3], N[2] + N[3], N[2]), respectively. In step 4240, the WT may also receive backlog information for a seventh set of queues, e.g., the set {queue 3} .if request dictionary 3 is in use by the WT. Operation proceeds from step 4258 to step 4266.<br>
[00212]      In step 4268, the WT encodes the backlog information corresponding to one of the fourth, fifth, sixth,, and seventh sets of queues into a third predetermined number of information bits, e.g., 4, said encoding optionally including quantization. In some embodiments, for at least some request dictionaries sub-step 4270 and sub-step 4272 are performed as part of step 4268. In some embodiments, for at least some request dictionaries for at least some iterations of step 4268, sub-step 4270 and sub-step<br>

4272 are performed as part of step 4268. Sub-step 4270 directs operation to a quantization level control factor subroutine. Sub-step 4272 calculates a quantization level as a function of a determined control factor.<br>
[00213]      Operation proceeds from step 4268 to step 4274, where the WT transmits the coded backlog information for one of the fourth, fifth. sixth, and seventh sets of queues using the third predetermined number of inforrmation bits, e.g., 4 information bits. Operation proceeds from step 4274 to return step 4276.<br>
[00214]      Exemplary quantization level control foctor subroutine 4278 will now be described. In some embodiments, the exemplary quantization leveI control factor subroutine 4278 implementation includes the use of table 1700 of Figure 17. First column 1702 lists a condition; second column 1704 lists the corresponding value of output control parameter y; third column 1706 lists the corresponding value of output control parameter Z. Operation starts in step 4279, and the subroutine receives power information 4280, e.g., the last DCCH transmitter power backoff report, and path loss information 4282, e.g., the last reported beacon ratio rePort. Operation proceeds from step 4279 to step 4284, where the WT checks as to whether or not the power information and path loss information satisfy a first criteria. For example, the first criteria is in an exemplary embodiment: (x&gt;28) AND (b&gt;=9), where x is the value in dBs of the most recent uplink transmission power backoff report, e.g., ULTxBKF5 and b is the value in dBs of the most recent downlink beacon ratio report, e.g., DLBNR4. If the first criteria is satisfied, then operation proceeds from step 4284 to step 4286; however if the first criteria is not satisfied, operation proceeds to step 4288.<br>
[00215]      In step 4286, the wireless terminal sets control factors, e.g. the set {Y, Z&gt;, to a first predetermined set of values, e.g., Y - Yl, z= Zl, where Yl andZl are positive integers. In one exemplary embodiment, Yl = 2 and Zl = 10.<br>
[00216] Returning to step 4288, in step 4288 the WT checks as to whether or not the power information and path loss information satisfy a second criteria. For example in an exemplary embodiment, the second criteria is (x&gt;27) AND (b&gt;=8). If the second criteria is satisfied, then operation proceeds from step 4288 to step 4290, where the<br>

wireless terminal sets control factors, e.g. the set {Y, Z}, to a second predetermined set of values, e.g., Y = Y2, Z= Z2, where Y2 and Z2 are positive integers. In one exemplary embodiment, Y2 = 2 and Z2 = 9, If the second criteria is not satisfied operation proceeds to another criteria checking step where, depending on whether or not the criteria is satisfied, the control factor are set to predetermined values or testing is continued.<br>
[00217]      There are a fixed number of test criteria, utilized in the quantization level control factor subroutine. If none of the first N-I test criteria are satisfied, operation proceeds to step 4292, where the wireless terminal tests as to whether or not the power information and path loss information satisfy an Nth criteria. For example in an exemplary embodiment where N=9, the Nth criteria is (x&gt;12) and (b
[00218]      Operation proceeds from step 4286, step 4290, other control factor setting steps, step 4294 or step 4296 to step 4298. In step 4298, the WT returns at least one control factor value, e.g., Y and/or Z.<br>
[00219]      Figure 43 is a flowchart 4300 of an exemplary method of operating a wireless terminal in accordance with various embodiments. Operation starts in step 4302, where the wireless terminal is powered on, initialized, has established a connection with a base station. Operation proceeds from start step 4302 to step 4304.<br>
[00220]      In step 4304, the wireless terminal determines whether the WT is operating in a full-tone format DCCH mode or a split-tone format DCCH mode. For each DCCH segment allocated to the WT in full-tone format DCCH mode, the WT<br>

proceeds from step 4304 to step 4306. For each DCCH segment allocated to the WT in split-tone format DCCH mode, the WT proceeds from step 4304 to step 4308.<br>
[00221}      In step 4306, the WT determines a set of 21 coded modulation-symbol values from 6 information bits (b5, b4, b3, b2, bl, bO). Step 4306 includes sub-steps 4312, 4314, 4316, and 4318. In sub-step 4312, the WT determines 3 additional bits (c2, cl, cO) as a function of the 6 information bits. For example, in one exemplary embodiment, c2clc0 = (b5b4b3)^(b2blb0) where .^ is a bit wise exclusive OR operation. Operation proceeds from step4312 to step4314. In sub-step 4314, the WT determines the seven most-significant modulation symbols using a first mapping function and 3 bits (b5, M, b3) as input. Operation proceeds from sub-step 4314 to sub- -step 4316. In sub-step 4316, the WT determines the seven next most significant modulation symbols using the first mapping function and 3 bits (b2, bl, bO) as input. Operation proceeds from siib-step 4316 to sub-step 4318. In sub-step 4318, the WT determines the seven least-significant modulation symbol using the first mapping function and 3 bits (c2, c 1, cO) as input<br>
[00222]      In step 4308, the WT determines a set of 21 coded modulation-symbol values from 8 information bits (b7, b6, b5, M, b3, b2, bl, bO). Step 4308 includes sub-steps 4320,4322, 4324, and 4326. In sub-step 4320, the WT determines 4 additional bits(c3, c2, cl,c0)as a function of the 8 information bits. For example, in one exemplary embodiment, c3c2clc0 = (b7b6b5b4).^(b3b2blb0) where .^ is abit wise exclusive OR operation. Operation proceeds from step 4320 to step 4322. In sub-step 4322, the WT determines the seven most-significant modulation symbols using a second mapping function and 4 bits (b7, b6, bS, b4) as input. Operation proceeds from sub-step 4322 to sub-step 4324. In sub-step 4324, the WT determines the seven next most significant modulation symbols using the second mapping function and 4 bits (b3, b2, bl, bO) as input. Operation proceeds from sub-step 4324 to sub-step 4326. In sub-step 4326, the WT determines the seven least-significant modulation symbol using the second mapping function and 4 bits (c3, c2, cl, cO) as input.<br>

[00223] For each DCCH segment allocated to the wireless tenninal, operation proceeds from either step 4306 or step 4308 to step 4310. In step 4310, the wireless terminal transmits the twenty-one determined modulation symbols of the segment.<br>
[00224]      In some embodiments, each DCCH segment corresponds to 21 OFDM tone symbols each tone-symbol of the DCCH segment using the same single logical tone in the uplink timing and frequency structure. The logical tone may be hopped during a DCCH segment, e.g., the same logical tone may corresponds to three different physical tones in the uplink tone block being used for the connection, with each physical tone remaining the same for seven successive OFDM symbol transmission time periods.<br>
[00225]      In one exemplary embodiment, each segment corresponds to multiple DCCH reports. In one exemplary embodiment, the first mapping function is represented by table 3700 of Figure 37, and the second mapping function is represented by table 3800 of Figure 38.<br>
[00226]      Figure 44 is a flowchart 4400 of an exemplary method of operating a wireless terminal to report control information in accordance with various embodiments. Operation starts in step 4402, where the wireless terminal is powered up and initialized. Operation proceeds from start step 4402 to step 4404. In step 4404, the WT checks as to whether or not one of the following has occurred: (i) a transition from a first mode of WT operation to a second mode of WT operation and (ii) a handoff operation from a first connection to a second connection while remaining in the second mode of operation. In some embodiments, the second mode of operation is an ON mode of operation and said first mode of operation is one of a hold mode of operation, a sleep mode of operation, and an ACCESS mode of operation. In some embodiments, during the ON mode of operation, the wireless terminal can transmit user data on an uplink and during the hold.and sleep modes of operation the wireless terminal is precluded from transmitting user data on said uplink. If one of the conditions checked for in step 4404 has occurred, operation proceeds to step 4406; otherwise, operation proceeds back to step 4404 where the checks are again performed.<br>

[00227]      In step 4406, the WT transmits an initial control information report set, said transmission of the initial control information report set having a first duration equal to a first time period. In some embodiments, the initial control information report set can include one or a plurality of reports. Operation proceeds from step 4406 to step 4408. In step 4408, the WT checks as to whether or not the WT is in the 2nd mode of operation. If the WT is in the second mode of operation, operation proceeds from step 4408 to step 4410; otherwise operation proceeds to step 4404.<br>
[00228]      In step 4410, the WT transmits a first additional control information report set, said transmission of the first additional control information report set for a period of time which is the same as first time period, the first additional control information report set being different than from said initial control information report set. In some embodiments, the initial control information report set is different from the first additional control information report set due to the initial and first additional control information report sets having different formats. In some embodiments, the initial control information report set includes at least one report that is not included in the first additional control information report set. In some such embodiments, the initial control infonnation report set includes at least two reports that are not included in the first additional control information report set. In some embodiments, the at least one report that is not included in the first additional control information report set is one of an interference report and a wireless terminal transmission power availability report-Operation proceeds from step 4410 to step 4412. In step 4412, the WT checks as to whether or not the WT is in the 2nd mode of operation. If the WT is in the second mode of operation, operation proceeds from step 4412 to step 4414; otherwise operation proceeds to step 4404.<br>
[00229]      In step 4414, the WT transmits a second additional control information report set for a period of time which is the same as said first time period, said second additional control information report including at least one report that is not included in said first additional control information report set. Operation proceeds from step 4414 to step 4416. In step 4416, the WT checks as to whether or not the WT is in the 2nd mode of operation.

[00230]      Figures 45 and 46 are used to illustrate an exemplary embodiment. Figures 45 and 46 are applicable to some embodiments discussed with respect to flowchart 4400 of Figure 44. Drawing 4500 of Figure 45 includes a initial control information report set 4502, followed by a first additional control information report set 4504, followed by a second additional control information report set 4506, followed by a 2nd iteration of first additional control information report set 4508, followed by a 2nd iteration of second additional control information 4510. Each control information report set (4502, 4504, 4506, 4508, 4510) has a corresponding transmission time period (4512, 4514,4516,4518,4520), respectively, where the duration of each of the time periods (4512,4514,4516, 4518,4520) is the same, the duration being 105 OFDM symbol transmission time periods.<br>
[00231]      Dotted line 4522 indicates that an event occurred slightly previous to the transmission of the initial control information report set transmission, the event being one of (i) a mode transition from an access mode as indicated by block 4524 to an ON state as indicated by block 4526, (ii) a mode transition from a HOLD state as indicated by block 4528 to an ON state as indicated by block 4530, and (iii) a handoff operation from a first connection in an ON state as indicated by block 4532 to a second connection in an ON state as indicated by block 4534.<br>
[00232]      As an example, initial control information report set 4502, first additional control information report set 4504 and second control information report set 4506 may be communicated during a first beacons lot, while 2nd iteration of first additional control information report set 4508 and 2nd iteration of second additional control infromation report set 4510 may be communicated during the next beaconslot. Continuing with the example, each information report set may correspond to a superslot within the beaconslot. For example, using the structure described with respect to the full-tone format of the DCCH for a wireless terminal of Figures 10 and 11, one possible mapping of segments corresponding to Figure 45 is the following. The initial control information report set corresponds to Figure 11; the first additional control information report set corresponding to indexed segments 30-34 of the beaconslot; the second additional<br>

[00236]      It can be observed in Figure 46 that the initial and first additional reports sets will be different because they use different formats, n Can also be seen that the initial control information report set includes at least two reports, DLBNR4 and ULTXBKF5, that are not included in the first additional control information report set. The DLSNR4 is an interference report and the ULTXBKFS is a wireless terminal power availability report. In the example of Figure 46, the second additional report includes at least one additional report that is not included in the first additional report, RSVD1 report.<br>
[00237]      Figure 47 is a flowchart 4700 of an exemplary method of operating a communications device in accordance with various embodiments; the communications device including information indicating a predetermined report sequence for use in controlling the transmission of a plurality of different control information reports on a recurring basis. In some embodiments, the communications device is a wireless terminal, e.g., a mobile node. For example, the wireless terminal may be one of a plurality of wireless terminals in a multiple access orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) wireless communications system.<br>
[00238]      Operation starts in step 4702, and proceeds to step 4704. In step 4704 the communications device checks as to whether or at least one of the following has occurred: (i) a transition from a first mode of communications device operation to a second mode of communications device operation and (ii) a handoff operation from a first connection, e.g., with a first base station sector physical attachment point, to a second connection, e.g., with a second base station sector physical attachment point, while remaining in the second mode of communications device operation. In some embodiments, the second mode of communications device operation is an ON mode of operation, and the first mode of operation is one of a hold mode of operation and a sleep mode of operation. In some such embodiments, the communications device can transmit user data on an uplink during the ON mode of Operation and is precluded from transmitting user data on the uplink during the hold and sleep modes of operation.<br>
[00239]      If at least one of the tested conditions of step 4704 was satisfied, then operation proceeds from step 4704 to either step 4706 or step 4708 depending upon the<br>

embodiment. Step 4706 is an optional step included in some embodiments, but omitted in other embodiments.<br>
[00240]      Step 4706 is included in some embodiments where the communications device supports a plurality of different initial condition control information report sets. In step 4706, the communications device selects which one of the plurality of initial control information report sets to transmit as a function of the portion of the sequence to be replaced. Operation proceeds from step 4706 to step 4708.<br>
[00241]      In step 4708, the communications device transmits an initial control information report set. In various embodiments, transmitting an initial control information report set includes transmitting at least one report which would not have been transmitted during the time period used to transmit the initial report if the transmitted reports had followed the predetermined sequence. For example, for a given initial report the at least one report which would not have been transmitted during the time period used to transmit the initial report if the transmitted reports had followed the predetermined sequence is one of an interference report, e.g., a beacon ratio report, and a communications device transmission power availability report, e.g., a communications device transmitter power backoff report. In various embodiments, the initial control information report set can include one or a plurality of reports. In some embodiments, transmitting an initial control information report set includes transmitting said initial control information report set on a dedicated uplink control channel. In some such embodiments, the dedicated uplink control channel is a single tone channel. In some such embodiments, the single tone of the single tone channel is hopped over time, e.g., the single logical channel lone changes to different physical tones due to tone hopping. In various embodiments, the predetermined report sequence repeats over a time period which is greater than a transmission time period used to transmit said initial report set. For example, in an exemplary embodiment, a predetermined reporting sequence repeats on a beaconslot basis, with a beaconslot being 912 OFDM symbol transmission time interval periods, while an exemplary time period used to transmit an initial report set may be 105 OFDM symbol transmission time periods.<br>

[00242]      Operation proceeds from step 4708 to step 4710, where the communications device checks as to whether it is in the second mode of operation. If the communications device is in the 2nd mode of operation, operation proceeds to step 4712; otherwise, operation proceeds to step 4704. In step 4712, the communications device transmits an additional control information report set in accordance with the information indicated in the predetermined reporting sequence. Operation proceeds from step 4712 to step 4710.<br>
[00243]      In some embodiments, step 4712 following an initial control information report set transmission of step 4708 includes a first additional control information report set, wherein the initial control information report set includes at least one information report set that is not included in the first additional control information report set. For example, the at least one information report that is not included in said first additional control information report set is one of an interference report, e.g., a beacon ratio report, and a communications device power availability report, e.g., a communications device transmission power backoff report.<br>
[00244]      In various embodiments, the repetition of step 4712 following an initial control information report of step 4712, e.g., while the communications device remains in the second mode of operation, includes the transmission of a first additional control information report set, followed by a second additional control information report set, followed by another first additional control information report set, where the second . additional control information report set includes at least one report that is not included in the first additional control information report set<br>
[00245]      As an exemplary embodiment, consider that the predetermined report sequence is the report sequence of 40 indexed segments for the uplink dedicated control channel segments in a beaconslot as illustrated by drawing 1099 of Figure 10. Further consider that the segments of the predetermined report sequence are grouped on a superslot basis with segment indexes (0-4), (5-9), (10-14), (15-19), (20-24), (25-29), (30-34), (35-39), and each group corresponds to a superslot of the beaconslot. If the condition of step 4704 is satisfied, e.g., the communications.device has just migrated from a HOLD state of operation to an ON state of operation, the communications device<br>

uses the initial report set as indicated in Table 1199 of Figure 11 for the first superslot, and then uses the predetermined sequence of table 1099 of Figure 10 for subsequent supers lots while remaining in the ON state. For example, the initial report set can replace any of the sets corresponding to segment index grouping (0-4), (5-9), (10-14), (15-] 9), (20-24), (25-29), (30-34, (35-39), depending upon when the state transition to the ON mode of operation occurs.<br>
[00246]      As a variation, consider an exemplary embodiment, where there are multiple, e.g., two, different initial control channel information report sets from which the communication device selects, as a function of the position in the sequence to be replaced. Figure 48 illustrates two exemplary different formats of control channel information report sets 4800 and 4850. Note that in the format of initial report set# 1, the 4th segment 4810 includes a DLBNR4 report, a RSVD1 report, and an ULRQST1 report, while in the format of initial report set # 2, the 4th segment 4860 includes a RSVD2 report and a ULRQST4 report. In an exemplary embodiment using the predetermined reporting sequence of Figure 10, if the initial control information report is to be transmitted in the 3rd superslot of a beaconslot (replacing segments indexes 10-14), then the format of initial control information report set #2 4850 is used; otherwise the format of initial control information report set #1 is used Note that in the exemplary predetermined reporting sequence of Figure 10, the 4 bit downlink beacon ratio report, DLBNR4, only occurs once during a beaconslot, and it occurs in the 4' superslot of the beaconslot. In this exemplary embodiment, the 2nd set of formats of initial reports 4850 is used in the 3rd superslot, since in the next subsequenct superslot of the beaconslot (the 4th superslot), the communications device is scheduled, in accordance with the predetermined structure of Figure 10, to transmit the DLBNR4 report.<br>
[00247]      As another variation, consider an exemplary embodiment, where there are multiple, e.g., five, different initial control channel information report sets from which the communications device selects, as a function of position in the sequence to be replaced, where each of the different initial control information report sets is a different size. Figure 49 illustrates initial control information report set #1 4900, initial control information report set #2 4910 initial control information report set #3 4920 initial<br>

In an exemplary embodiment using the predetermined reporting sequence of Figure 10, if the initial control information report is to be transmitted starting in segment with DCCH index value = 0, 5, 10, 15,20, 25,30, or 35 of the beaconslot, then initial control information report set #1 4900 is used. Alternatively, if the initial control information report is to be transmitted starting in segment with DCCH index value = 1, 6, 11, 16, 21, 26, 31, or 36 of the beaconslot, then initial control information report set #2 4910 is used. Alternatively, if the initial control information report is to be transmitted starting in segment with DCCH index value = 2, 7, 12,17, 22,27, 32, or 37 of the beaconslot, then initial control information report set #3 4920 is used. Alternatively, if the initial control information report is to be transmitted starting in segment with DCCH index value = 3, 8, 13, 18, 23, 28, 33, or 38 of the beaconslot, then initial control information report set #4 4930 is used. Alternatively, if the initial control information report is to be transmitted starting in segment with DCCH index value = 4, 9,14, 19,24, 29, 34, or 39 of the beaconslot, then initial control information report set #5 4940 is used.<br>
[00248]      Embodiments are possible where different initial information report sets differ in both the size of the report set and the content of the report set for a given DCCH segment of the superslot.<br>
[00249]      Figure 50 is a flowchart of an exemplary method of operating a wireless terminal in accordance with various embodiments. For example, the wireless terminal may be a mobile node in an exemplary spread spectrum multiple access orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) wireless communications system. Operation starts in step 5002, where the wireless terminal has been powered on, established a communications link with a base station sector attachment point, has been allocated dedicated control channel segments to use for uplink dedicated control channel reports, and has been established in either a first mode of operation or a second mode of operation. For example, in some embodiments, the first mode of operation is a full-tone mode of dedicated control channel operation, while the second mode of operation is a split tone mode of dedicated control channel operation. In some embodiments, each of the dedicated control channel segments includes the same number of tone-symbols, e.g., 21 tone-symbols. Operation proceeds from start step 5002 to step 5004. Two<br>

exemplary types of embodiments are illustrated in flowchart 5000. In a first type of embodiment, the base station sends mode control signals to command changes between first and second modes of operation. In such exemplary embodiments, operation proceeds from step 5002 to steps 5010 and 5020. In a second type of embodiment, the wireless terminal requests mode transitions between first and second modes. In such an embodiment, operation proceeds from step 5002 to steps 5026 and step 5034. Embodiments are also possible, where the base station can command mode changes without input from the wireless terminal, and where the wireless terminal can request mode changes, e.g., with the base station and wireless terminal each being capable of initiating a mode change.<br>
[00250]      In step 5004, the WT checks as to whether the WT is currently in a first or second mode of operation. If the WT is currently in a first mode of operation, e.g., a full tone mode, operation proceeds from step 5004 to step 5006. In step 5006, the WT uses a first set of dedicated control channel segments during a first period of time, said first set including a first number of dedicated control channel segments. However, if it is determined in step 5004, that the WT is in a second mode of operation, e.g., a split tone mode, operation proceeds from step 5004 to step 5008. In step 5008, the WT uses a second set of dedicated control channel segments during a second period of time having the same, duration of as said first time period, said second set of control channel segments including fewer segments than said first number of segments.<br>
[00251]      For example, in one exemplary embodiment, if one considers the first period of time to be a beacons lot, the first set in the full-tone mode includes 40 DCCH segments using a single logical tone, while the second set in the split-tone mode includes 13 DCCH segments using a single logical tone. The single logical tone used by the WT in the full-mode may be same or different than the single logical tone used in the split tone mode.<br>
[00252]      As another example, in the same exemplary embodiment, if one considers the first time period to be the first 891 OFDM symbol transmission time intervals of a be aeons lot, the first set in full-tone mode includes 39 DCCH segments using a single logical tone, while the second set in the split-tone mode includes 13<br>

DCCH segments using a single logical tone. In this example, the first number of segments divided by the second number of segments is the integer 3. The single logical tone used by the WT in the full-mode may be same or different than the single logical tone used in the split tone mode.<br>
[00253 ]      During the second mode of operation, e.g., split-tone mode, the second set of dedicated control channel segments used by the WT is, in some embodiments, a subset of a larger set of dedicated control channel segments that can be used by the same or a different WT in a full-tone mode of operation during a time period that is not the second time period. For example, the first set of dedicated control channel segments used during the first period of time by the wireless terminal can be the larger set of dedicated control channel segments, and the first and second sets of dedicated control channel segments can correspond to the same logical tone.<br>
[00254]      Operation proceeds from step 5002 to step 5010 for each lst type of mode control signal directed to the WT, e.g., a mode control signal commanding the WT to switch from a first mode to a second mode of operation. In step 5010, the WT receives a first type mode control, signal from a base station. Operation proceeds from step 5010 to step 5012. In step 5012 the WT checks as to whether or not it is currently in a first mode of operation. If the wireless terminal is in a first mode of operation, operation proceeds to step 5014 where the WT switches from a first mode of operation to a second mode of operation in response to said received control signal. However, if it is determined in step 5012 that the WT is not currently in the first mode of operation, the WT proceeds via connecting node A 5016 to step 5018, where the WT stops the implementation of the mode change since there is a misunderstanding between the base station and WT.<br>
[00255]      Operation proceeds from step 5002 to step 5020 for each 2nd type of mode control signal directed to the WT, e.g., a mode control signal commanding the WT to switch from a second mode to a first mode of operation. In step 5020, the WT receives a second type mode control signal from a base station. Operation proceeds from step 5020 to step 5022. In step 5022 the WT checks as to whether or not it is currently in a second mode of operation. If the wireless terminal is in a second mode of<br>

operation, operation proceeds to step 5024 where the WT switches from a second mode of operation to a first mode of operation in response to said received second mode control signal. However, if it is determined in step 5022 that the WT is not currently in the second mode of operation, the WT proceeds via connecting node A 5016 to step 5018, where the WT stops the implementation of the mode change since there is a misunderstanding between the base station and WT.<br>
[00256]      In some embodiments, the first and/or second type of mode control change command signal from a base station also include information identifying whether the logical tone used by the WT will change following the mode switch and, in some embodiments, information identifying the logical tone to be used by the WT in the new mode.  In some embodiments, if the WT proceeds to step 5018, the WT signals the base station, e.g., indicating that there is a misunderstanding and that a mode transition has not been completed.<br>
[00257]      Operation proceeds from step 5002 to step 5026 for each time that the wireless terminal proceeds to initiate a mode change from a first mode of operation, e.g., full-tone DCCH mode, to a second mode of operation, e.g., split-tone DCCH mode. In step 5026, the WT transmits a mode control signal to a base station. Operation proceeds from step 5026 to step 5028. In step 5028 the WT receives an acknowledgement signal from the base station. Operation proceeds from step 5028 to step 5030. In step 5030 if the received acknowledgement signal is a positive acknowledgment, operation proceeds to step 5032, where the wireless terminal switches from a first mode of operation to a second mode of operation in response to said received positive acknowledgement signal. However, if in step.5030, the WT determines that the received signal is a negative acknowledgment signal or the WT cannot successfully decode the received signal the WT proceeds via connecting node A 5016 to step 5018 where the WT stops the mode change operation.<br>
[00258]      Operation proceeds from step 5002 to step 5034 for each time that the wireless terminal proceeds to initiate a mode change from a second mode of operation, e.g., split-tone DCCH mode, to a second mode of operation, e.g., full-tone DCCH mode. In step 5034, the WT transmits a mode control signal to a base station. Operation<br>

proceeds from step 5034 to step 5036. In step 5036 the WT receives an acknowledgement signal from the base station. Operation proceeds from step 5036 to step 5038. In step 5038 if the received acknowledgement signal is a positive acknowledgment, operation proceeds to step 5040, where the wireless terminal switches from a second mode of operation to a first mode of operation in response to said received positive acknowledgement signal. However, if in step 5038, the WT determines that the received signal is a negative acknowledgment signal or the WT cannot successfully decode the received signal the WT proceeds via connecting node A 5016 to step 5018 where the WT stops the mode change operation.<br>
[00259]      Figure 51 is a drawing illustrating exemplary operation in accordance with various embodiments. In the exemplary embodiment of Figure 51, the dedicated control channel is structured to use a repeating pattern of 16 segments indexed from 0 to 15, for each logical tone in the dedicated control channel. Other embodiments may use a different number of indexed DCCH segments in a recurring pattern, e.g., 40 segments. Four exemplary logical DCCH tones, indexed (0, 1, 2, 3) are illustrated in Figure 51. In some embodiments, each segment occupies the same amount of air link resources. For example, in some embodiments, each segment has same number of tone-symbols, e.g., 21 tone-symbols. Drawing 5100 identifies the index of the segments over time for two successive iterations of the pattern corresponding to a logical tone in drawing 5104.<br>
[00260]      Drawing 5104 plots logical DCCH tone index on vertical axis 5106 vs time on horizontal axis 5108. A first time period 5110 and a second lime period 5112 are shown which have the same duration. Legend 5114 identifies: (i) squares with widely spaced Crosshatch shading 5116 represents WT1 full-tone DCCH mode segments, (ii) squares with widely spaced vertical and horizontal line shading 5118 represent WT4 full-tone DCCH mode segments, (iii) squares with narrowly spaced vertical and horizontal line shading 5120 represent WT5 full-tone DCCH mode segments, (iv) squares with fine Crosshatch shading 5122 represent WT6 full-tone DCCH mode segments, (v) squares with widely spaced diagonal line shading sloping upward from left to right 5124 represent WT1 split-tone DCCH mode segments, (vi) squares with narrowly spaced diagonal line shading sloping downward from left to right 5126 represent WT2 split-tone DCCH mode segments, (vii) squares with narrowly<br>

|00261 ]      In drawing 5104, it may be observed that WT1 is in full-tone DCCH mode during the first time period 5110 and uses a set of 15 segments (indexed 0-14) corresponding to logical tone 0 during that time period. During the 2nd time period 5112, which is the same duration as the first time period, WT1 is in split-tone DCCH mode and uses a set of 5 segments with index values (0,3, 6, 9, 12) corresponding to logical tone 0, which is a subset of the set of segments used during the 1st time period 5110.<br>
[00262]      In drawing 5104, it may also be observed that WT4 is in full-tone DCCH mode during 1st time period 5110 and uses a set of 15 segments (indexed 0-14) corresponding to logical tone 2, and WT4 is in split tone format during 2nd time period 5112 and uses a set of 5 segments with index values (1, 4, 7, 10, 13) corresponding to logical tone 3. It should also be observed that the set of 5 segments with index values (1,4, 7, 10, 13) corresponding to logical tone 3 is part of a larger set of segments used by WT6 in full-tone DCCH mode during the 1st time period 5110.<br>
[00263]      Figure 52 is a flowchart 5200 of an exemplary method of operating a base station in accordance with various embodiments. Operation of the exemplary method starts in step 5202, where the base station is powered on and initialized. Operation proceeds to steps 5204 and steps 5206. In step 5204, the base station, on an ongoing basis, partitions the dedicated control channel resources between full-tone DCCH sub-channels and split tone DCCH sub-channel and allocates the full-tone and split tone DCCH sub-channels among a plurality of wireless terminals. For example, in an exemplary embodiment the DCCH channel uses 31 logical tones and each logical tone corresponds to 40 DCCH channel segments in a single iteration of a repeating pattern, e.g., on a beaconslot basis. At any given time each logical tone can correspond to either a full-tone DCCH mode of operation where DCCH segments corresponding to the tone are allocated to a single WT, or a split tone DCCH mode where DCCH segments corresponding to the tone can be allocated to up to a fixed maximum number<br>

of WTs, e.g., where the fixed maximum number of WTs = 3. In such an exemplary embodiment using 31 logical tones for the DCCH channel, if each of the DCCH channel logical tones are in full-tone mode, the base station sector attachment point can have allocated DCCH segments to 31 WTs. At the other extreme if each of the DCCH channel logical tones are in split-tone format, then 93 WTs can be assigned segments. In general, at any given time the DCCH channel is partitioned and may include a mixture of full and split tone sub-channels, e.g., to accommodate current loading conditions and current needs of the WTs using the base station as their attachment point.<br>
[00264]      Figure S3 illustrates exemplary partitioning and allocation of dedicated control channel resources for another exemplary embodiment, e.g., an embodiment using 16 indexed DCCH segments corresponding to a logical tone which repeat on a recurring basis. The method described with respect to Figure 53 may be used in step 5204 and may be extended to other embodiments.<br>
[00265]      Step 5204 includes sub-step 5216, in which the base station communicates to the WTs sub-channel allocation information. Sub-step 5216 includes sub-step 5218. In sub-step 5218, the base station assigns user identifiers to WTs receiving allocation of dedicated control channel segments, e.g., on state user identifiers.<br>
[00266]      In step 5206, the base station, on an ongoing basis, receives uplink signals from WTs including dedicated control channel reports communicated on the allocated DCCH sub-channels. In some embodiments, the wireless terminals use different coding to communicate information transmitted in DCCH segments during a full-tone DCCH mode of operation and during a split-tone DCCH mode of operation; therefore the base station performs different decoding operations based on the mode.<br>
[00267]      Two exemplary types of embodiments are illustrated in flowchart 5200. In a first type of embodiment, the base station sends mode control signals to command changes between first and second modes of operation, e.g., between full-tone DCCH mode and split-tone DCCH mode. In such exemplary embodiments, operation proceeds from step 5202 to steps 5208 and 5010. In a second type of embodiment, the wireless<br>

terminal requests mode transitions between first and second modes, e.g., between full-tone DCCH mode and split-tone DCCH mode. In such an embodiment, operation proceeds from step 5202 to steps 5212 and step 5214. Embodiments are also possible where the base station can command mode changes without input from the wireless terminal, and where the wireless terminal can request mode changes, e.g., with the base station and wireless terminal each being capable of initiating a mode change.<br>
[00268]      Operation proceeds to step 5208 for each instance where the base station decides to command a WT to change from a first mode, e.g., full-mode DCCH mode to a second mode, e.g. split-tone DCCH mode. In step 5208, the base station sends a mode control signal to a WT to initiate a WT transition from a first mode, e.g., full-tone DCCH mode, to a second mode, e.g., split-tone DCCH mode.<br>
[00269]      Operation proceeds to step 5210 for each instance where the base station decides to command a WT to change from the second mode, e.g., split-mode DCCH mode, to the first mode, e.g. full-tone DCCH mode. In step 5210, the base station sends a mode control signal to a WT to initiate a WT transition from the second mode, e.g., split-tone DCCH mode, to the first mode, e.g., full-tone DCCH mode.<br>
[00270]     Operation proceeds to step 5212 for each instance where the base station receives a request from a WT to change from a first mode, e.g., full-tone DCCH mode to a second mode, e.g. split-tone DCCH mode. In step 5212, the base station receives a mode control signal from a WT requesting a transition from a first mode of operation to a second mode of operation, e.g., from full-tone DCCH mode to split-tone DCCH mode. Operation proceeds from step 5212 to step 5220, if the base station decides to accommodate the request. In step 5220, the base station transmits a positive acknowledgement signal to the WT which sent the request.<br>
[00271]      Operation proceeds to step 5214 for each instance where the base station receives a request from a WT to change from a second mode, e.g., split-tone DCCH mode to a first mode, e.g. full-tone DCCH mode. In step 5214, the base station receives a mode control signal from a WT requesting a transition from a second mode of operation to a first mode of operation, e.g., from split-tone DCCH mode to full-tone<br>

DCCH mode. Operation proceeds from step 5214 to step 5222, if the base station decides to accommodate the request. In step 5222, the base station transmits a positive acknowledgement signal to the WT which sent the request.<br>
[ 00272]     Figure 53 is a drawing illustrating exemplary operation in accordance with various embodiments. In the exemplary embodiment of Figure 53, the dedicated control channel is structured to use a repeating pattern of 16 segments indexed from 0 to 15, for each logical tone in the dedicated control channel. Other embodiments may use a different number of indexed DCCH segments in a recurring pattern, e.g., 40 segments. Three exemplary logical DCCH tones, indexed (0, 1, 2) are illustrated in Figure 53. In some embodiments, each segment occupies the same amount of air link resources. For example, in some embodiments, each segment has same number of tone-symbols, e.g., 21 tone-symbols. Drawing 5300 identifies the index of the segments over time for two successive iterations of the recurring indexing pattern corresponding to a logical tone in drawing 5304.<br>
[00273]      Drawing 5304 plots logical DCCH tone index on vertical axis 5306 vs time on horizontal axis 5308. A first time period 5310 and a second time period 5312 are shown which have the same duration.

[00274]      In drawing 5304, it may be observed that WT1 is in full-tone DCCH mode during the first time period 5310 and uses a set of 15 segments (indexed 0-14) corresponding to logical tone 0 during that time period. In accordance with some embodiments, a base station allocated a first dedicated control sub-channel to WT1, the first dedicated control sub-channel including the set of 15 segments (indexed 0-14) corresponding to logical tone 0 for use during 1st time period 5310.<br>
[00275]      In drawing 5304, it may also be observed that WT2, WT3, and WT4 are each split-tone DCCH mode during the first time period 5310 and each use a set of 5 segments indexed ((0, 3, 6, 9,12), (1,4,7, 10, 13), (2, 5, 8, 11, 14)), respectively corresponding to the same logical tone, logical tone 1 during 1st time period 5310. In accordance with some embodiments, a base station allocated a (second, third, and fourth) dedicated control sub-channel to (WT2, WT3, WT3), the (second, third, and fourth) dedicated control sub-channels each including a set of 5 segments with index values ((0, 3, 6, 9, 12), (1,4, 7, 10, 13), (2, 5, 8, 11, 14)), respectively corresponding to the same logical tone, logical tone 1 during 1st time period 5310.<br>
[00276]      In drawing 5304, it may also be observed that WT6, WT7, and WT8 are each spl i t-tone DCCH mode during the first time period 5310 and each use a set of 5 segments indexed ((0, 3,6, 9, 12), (1,4,7, 10, 13), (2, 5, 8, 11, 14)), respectively corresponding to the same logical tone, logical tone 2 during 1st time period 5310. In accordance with some embodiments, a base station allocated a (fifth, sixth, and seventh) dedicated control sub-channel to (WT6, WT7, WT8), the (fifth, sixth, and seventh) dedicated control sub-channels each including a set of 5 segments with index values ((0, 3,6,9,12), (1,4, 7, 10, 13), (2, 5,8,11, 14)), respectively corresponding to the same logical tone, logical tone 2 during 1 st time period 5310.<br>
[00277]      In drawing 5304, it may be observed that (WT1, WT5) are in split-tone DCCH mode during the second time period 5312 and each uses a set of 5 segments with<br>
SUBSTITUTE SHEET (RULE 26)<br><br><br>

PCT/US2006/048584<br><br>
index values (o, 3, 6, 9, 12), (1,4, 7,10,13)), respectively, corresponding to logical tone 0 during the second time period 5312. In accordance with various embodiments, a base station allocated an (eighth, ninth) dedicated control sub-channel to (WT1, WT5), the (eighth, ninth) dedicated control sub-channel including the set of 5 segments with inex(9,3, 69 12), (1,4, 7,20, 13)), respectively, corresponding to logical tone 0 during the second time period 5312. WT1 used logical tone 0 during the first time period, while WT 5 did not use logical tone 0 during the first time period.<br>
[00278]       in drawing 5304, it may also be observed that (WT2) is in full-tone DCCH mode during the second time period 5312 and uses a set of 15 segments indexed (0-14) corresponding to logical tone I during the second time period 5312. In accordance with some embodiments, a base station allocated a (tenth) dedicated control sub-channel to (WT2), the dedicated control sub-channel including the set of 15 segments indexed (0-14) corresponding to logical tone I during the second time period 5312. It may be noted that WT2 is one of the WTs from the set of (WT2, WT3, WT4) which used logical tone 1 during the first time period 5310.<br>
[00279]      in drawing 5304, it may also be observed that (WT9) is in full-tone DCCH mode during the second time period 5312 and each uses a set of 15 segments indexed (0- l0) corresponding to logical tone 2 during the second time period 5312. In accordance with some embodiments, a base station allocated an (eleventh) dedicated control sub-channel to (WT9), the dedicated control sub-channel including the set of 15 segments indexed (0-14) corresponding to logical tone 2 during the second time period 5312. It may be noted that WT9 is a different WT than the WTs (WT6, WT7, WT8) which used logical tone 2 during the first time period 5310.<br>
[00280]       in some embodiments, the logical tones (tone 0, tone 1, tone 2) are subjected to an uplink tone hopping operation which determines which physical tones the logical tones correspond to for each of a plurality of symbol transmission time periods, e.g., in the first time period 5310. For example, logical tones 0, 1, and 2 may be part of a logical channel structure including 113 logical tones, which are hopped, in accordance with a hopping sequence to a set of 113 physical tones used for uplink signaling. Continuing with the example, consider that each DCCH segment<br>

corresponds to a single logical tone and corresponds to 21 successive OFDM symbol transmission time intervals. In an exemplary embodiment, the logical lone is hopped such that the logical tone corresponding to three physical tones, with the wireless terminal using each physical tone for seven consecutive symbol transmission time intervals of the segment.<br>
[00281]      In an exemplary embodiment using 40 indexed DCCH channel segments corresponding to a logical tone which repeat on a recurring basis, an exemplary lst and 2nd time period may each include 39 DCCH segments, e.g., the first 39 DCCH segments of a beaconslot corresponding to the logical tone. In such an embodiment, if a given tone is in full-tone format, a WT is allocated by the base station a set of 39 DCCH segments for the 1st or 2nd time period corresponding to the allocation. If a given tone is in split-tone format, a WT is allocated a set of 13 DCCH segments for the 1st or 2nd time period corresponding to the allocation. In full-tone mode the 40th indexed segment can also be allocated to and used by the WT in full-tone mode. In split-tone mode, in some embodiments, the 40th indexed segment is a reserved segment.<br>
[00282]      Figure 54 is a drawing of a flowchart 5400 of an exemplary method of operating a wireless terminal in accordance with various embodiments. Operation starts in step 5402 where the wireless terminal is powered on and initialized. Operation proceeds from step 5402 to steps 5404, 5406, and 5408. In step 5404, the wireless terminal measures the received power of a downlink null channel (DL.NCH) and determines an interference power (N). For example, the Null channel corresponds to predetermined tone-symbols in an exemplary downlink timing and frequency structure used by the base station serving as the current attachment point for the wireless terminal in which the base station intentionally does not transmit using those tone-symbols; therefore, received power on the NULL channel measured by the wireless terminal receiver represents interference. In step 5406, the wireless terminal measures the received power (G*Po) of a downlink pilot channel (DL.PICH). In step 5408, the wireless terminal measures the signal to noise ratio (SNRo) of the downlink pilot channel (DL.PICH). Operation proceeds from steps 5404, 5406, and 5408 to step 5410.<br>
SUBSTITUTE SHEET (RULE 26)<br>

WO 2007/075773<br><br>
PCT/US2006/048584<br><br>
[00283]       In step 5410, the wireless terminal calculates the saturation level of the downlink signal to noise ratio as a function of: the interference power, measured received power of the downlink pilot channel, and measured SNR of the downlink pilot channel. For example, saturation level of the DL SNR = 1/ao = (1/SNRo - N/(GP0))-1 Operation proceeds from step 5410 to steps 5412. In step 5412, the wireless terminal selects the closet value from a predetermined table of quantized level of saturation level of downlink SNR to represent the calculated saturation level in a dedicated control channel report, and the wireless terminal generates the report. Operation proceeds from step 5412 to step 5414. In step 5414, the wireless terminal transmits the generated report to the base station, said generated report being communicated using a dedicated control channel segment allocated to the wireless terminal, e.g., using a predetermined portion of a predetermined indexed dedicated control channel segment.

[00345]   ' In step 5910, the wireless terminal proceeds to step 5912 if the wireless terminal has determined that it in full-tone DCCH mode, while operation proceeds to step 5914 if the wireless terminal has determined that it in split-tone DCCH mode.<br>
[00346]      In step 5912, the wireless terminal identifies DCCH communication segments allocated to the wireless terminal using time information 5906 and the identified logical DCCH tone. For example, in an exemplary embodiment, for each beacon slot, the wireless terminal identifies a set of 40 indexed DCCH segments corresponding to assigned logical DCCH tone. Operation proceeds from step 5912 to step 5916, for each identified communications segment. In step 5916, the wireless terminal using time information 5906, the indexed value of the DCCH segment within the recurring structure, and stored information associating sets of report types with each indexed segment, identifies a set of report types to be communicated in the DCCH communications segment. Operation proceeds from step 5916 via connecting node A 5920 to step 5924.<br>
[00347]      In step 5924, the wireless terminal checks as to whether any of report types identified in step 5916 include a flexible report. If any of the identified report types indicate a flexible report, then operation proceeds from step 5924 to step 5928; otherwise operation proceedsfrom step 5924 to step 5926.<br>
[00348]       In step 5926, the wireless terminal, for each fixed type information report of the segment, maps the information to be conveyed to a fixed number of information bits corresponding to the report size, said fixed type of information reports being dictated by a reporting schedule. Operation proceeds from step 5926 to step 5942.<br>
[00349|      In step 5928, the wireless terminal selects which type of report from among a plurality of fixed type information report types to include as a flexible report<br>

body. Step 5928 includes sub-step 5930. In sub-step 5930, the wireless terminal performs the selection as a Junction of a report prioritization operation. Sub-step 5930 includes sub-step 5932 and 5934. In sub-step 5932, the wireless terminal considers the amount of uplink data queued for communication to the access node, e.g., the backlog in aplurality of request queues, and at least one signal interference measurement, e.g., a beacon ratio report. In sub-step 5934, the wireless terminal determines an amount of change in information previously reported in at least one report, e.g., a measured change in a downlink saturation level of self-noise SNR report Operation proceeds from step 5928 to step 5936.<br>
[00350]      In step 5936, the wireless terminal codes the type of flexible body report into a type identifier, e.g., a two bit flexible report body identifier. Operation proceeds from step 5936 to step 5938. In step 5938, the wireless terminal maps the information to be conveyed in the flexible report body in accordance with the selected report type to a number of information bits corresponding to the flexible report body size. Operation proceeds from step 5938 to either step 5940 or step 5942. Step 5942 is an optional step, included in some embodiments. In step 5940, for each fixed type information report of the segment in addition to the flexible report, map the information to be conveyed to a fixed number of information bits corresponding to the report size. Operation proceeds from step 5940 to step 5942. For example, in some embodiments, a DCCH segment including a flexible report, when in the full-tone mode utilizes the full number of information bits communicated by the segment for itself, e.g., the segment conveys 6 information bits, 2 bits are used for identifying the type of report and 4 bits used for conveying the body of the report In such an embodiment, step 5940 is not performed. In some other embodiments, the total number of bits conveyed by a DCCH segment in the full-tone DCCH mode is greater than the number of bits represented by the flexible report and step 5940 is included to utilize the remaining information bits of the segment. For example, the segment conveys a total of 7 information bits 6 of which are utilized by the flexible report and 1 is used for a fixed one information bit uplink traffic request report.<br>
[00351]      In step 5942, the wireless terminal performs coding and modulation operations to generate a set of modulation symbols to represent the one or more reports<br>

to be communicated in the DCCH segment. Operation proceeds from step 5942 to step 5944. In step 5944, the wireless terminal, for each modulation symbol of the set of generated modulation symbols determines, using time information 5906 and tone hopping information, the physical tone to be used to convey the modulation symbol. For example, in an exemplary embodiment, each DCCH segment corresponds to 21 OFDM tone-symbols each tone symbol being used to convey one QPSK modulation symbol, each of the 21 OFDM tone-symbols corresponding to the same logical DCCH tone; however due to uplink tone hopping, 7 OFDM tone symbols in a first set of seven successive OFDM symbol time periods corresponding to a first physical tone, a second set of seven OFDM tone-symbols in a second set of seven successive OFDM symbol time periods corresponding to a second physical tone, and a third set of seven successive OFDM symbol time periods corresponding to a third physical tone, the first second and third physical tones being different. Operation proceeds from step 5944 to step 5946. In step 5946, the wireless terminal transmits each modulation symbol of the DCCH segment using the determined corresponding physical tone.<br>
[00352]      Returning to step 5914, in step 5914, the wireless terminal identifies DCCH communication segments allocated to the wireless terminal using time information 5906, the identified logical DCCH tone, and the information identifying the one among the plurality of sets of DCCH segments. For example, in an exemplary embodiment, for each beacon slot, the wireless terminal identifies a set of 13 indexed DCCH segments corresponding to assigned logical DCCH tone. Operation proceeds from step 5914 to step 5918, for each identified DCCH communications segment. In step 5918, the wireless terminal using time information 5906, the indexed value of the DCCH segment within the recurring structure, and stored information associating sets of report types with each indexed segment, identifies a set of report types to be communicated in the DCCH communications segment. Operation proceeds form step 5916 via connecting node B 5922 to step 5948.<br>
[00353]      In step 5948, the wireless terminal checks as to whether any of report types identified in step 5918 include a flexible report. If any of the identified report types indicate a flexible report, then operation proceeds from step 5948 to step 5952; otherwise operation proceeds from step 5948 to step 5950.<br>

[00354]       In step 5950, the wireless terminal, for each fixed type information report of the segment, maps the information to be conveyed to a fixed number of information bits corresponding to the report size, said fixed type of information reports being dictated by a reporting schedule. Operation proceeds from step 5950 to step 5966.<br>
[00355]      In step 5952, the wireless terminal selects which type of report from among a plurality of fixed type information report types to include as a flexible report body. Step 5952 includes sub-step 5954. In sub-step 5954, the wireless terminal performs the selection as a function of a report prioritization operation. Sub-step 5954 includes sub-step 5956 and 5958. In sub-step 5956, the wireless terminal considers the amount of uplink data queued for communication to the access node, e.g., the backlog in a plurality of request queues, and at least one signal interference measurement, e.g., a beacon ratio report. In sub-step 5958, the wireless terminal determines an amount of change in information previously reported in at least one report, e.g., a measured change in a downlink saturation level of self-noise SNR report. Operation proceeds from step 5952 to step 5960.<br>
[00356]      In step 5960, the wireless terminal codes the type of flexible body report into a type identifier, e.g., a single bit flexible report body identifier. Operation proceeds from step 5960 to step 5962. In step 5962, the wireless terminal maps the information to be conveyed in the flexible report body in accordance with the selected report type to a number of information bits corresponding to the flexible report body size. Operation proceeds from step 5962 to either step 5964 or step 5966. Step 5964 is an optional step, included in some embodiments. In step 5964, for each fixed type information report of the segment in addition to the flexible report, map the information to be conveyed to a fixed number of information bits corresponding to the report size. Operation proceeds from step 5964 to step 5966. For example, in some embodiments, a DCCH segment including a flexible report, when in the split-tone mode utilizes the full number of information bits communicated by the segment for itself, and in such an embodiment, step 5964 is not performed. In some other embodiments, the total number of bits conveyed by a DCCH segment in the split-tone DCCH mode is greater than the number of bits represented by the flexible report and step 5940 is included to utilize the<br>

remaining information bits of the segment. For example, the segment conveys a total of 8 information bits 6 of which are utilized by the flexible report and I information bit is used for a fixed one information bit uplink traffic request report, and 1 information bit is used for another predetermined report type. In some embodiments, the size of the body of the flexible report varies corresponding to different selections of the type of report to be conveyed by the flexible report, e.g., a 4 bit uplink traffic channel request or a five bit uplink transmission power backoff report, and the remainder of the available bits in the segment can be allocated to predetermined fixed report types, e.g., 1 or 2 bits.<br>
[00357]      In step 5966, the wireless terminal performs coding and modulation operations to generate a set of modulation symbols to represent the one or more reports to be communicated in the DCCH segment. Operation proceeds from step 5966 to step 5968. In step 5968, the wireless terminal, for each modulation symbol of the set of generated modulation symbols determines, using time information 5906 and tone hopping information, the physical tone to be used to convey the modulation symbol. For example, in an exemplary embodiment, each DCCH segment corresponds to 21 OFDM tone-symbols each tone symbol being used to convey one QPSK modulation symbol, each of the 21 OFDM tone-symbols corresponding to the same logical DCCH tone; however due to uplink tone hopping, 7 OFDM tone symbols in a first set of seven successive OFDM symbol time periods corresponding to a first physical tone, a second set of seven OFDM tone-symbols in a second set of seven successive OFDM symbol time periods corresponding to a second physical tone, and a third set of seven successive OFDM symbol time periods corresponding to a third physical tone, the first second and third physical tones being determined in accordance with tone hopping information and may be different. Operation proceeds from step 5968 to step 5970. In step 5970, the wireless terminal transmits each modulation symbol of the DCCH segment using the determined corresponding physical tone.<br>
[003581      Figure 60 is a flowchart 6000 of an exemplary method of operating a wireless terminal to provide transmission power information to a base station in accordance with various embodiments. Operation starts in step 6002. For example, the wireless terminal may have been previously powered on, established a connection with a base station, have transitioned in the ON state of operation, and been assigned<br>

dedicated control channel segments to use in either a full-tone or split tone mode of DCCH operation. The full-tone DCCH mode of operation is in some embodiments, a mode in which the wireless tone is dedicated a single logical tone channel used for DCCH segments which is not shared with other wireless terminal, while the split tone-DCCH mode of operation is, in some embodiments, a mode in which the wireless terminal is dedicated a portion of a single logical DCCH tone channel which can be allocated to be used on a time shared with another wireless terminal or terminals. Operation proceeds from start step 6002 to step 6004.<br>
[003 59]      In step 6004, the wireless terminal generates a power report indicating a ratio of a maximum transmit power of the wireless terminal to the transmit power of a reference signal having a power level known to the wireless terminal at a point in time corresponding to the power report. In some embodiments the power report is a backoff report, e.g., a wireless terminal transmission power backoff report, indicating a dB value. In some embodiments, the maximum transmission power value depends on a power output capability of the wireless terminal. In some embodiments, the maximum transmission power is specified by a government regulation limiting the maximum output power level of the wireless terminal. In some embodiments, the reference signal is controlled by the wireless terminal based upon at least one closed loop power level control signal received from abase station. In some embodiment, the reference signal is a control information signal transmitted over a dedicated control channel to the base station. The reference signal, in some embodiments, is measured for received power level by the base station to which it is transmitted. In various embodiments, the dedicated control channel is a single tone control channel which corresponds to a single logical tone dedicated to the wireless terminal for use in transmitting control information. In various embodiments, the power report is a power report corresponding to a single instant in time. In some embodiments, the known reference signal is a signal transmitted on the same channel as the power report, e.g., the same DCCH channel. In various embodiments, the point in time to which a generated power report corresponds has a known offset from a start of a communication segment, e.g., a DCCH segment, in which said power report is to be transmitted. Step 6004 includes sub-step 6006, sub-step 6008, sub-step 6010, and sub-step 6012.<br>

[00360]      In sub-step 6006, the wireless terminal performs a subtraction operation including subtracting a per-tone transmission power of an uplink dedicated control channel in dBm from a maximum transmission power of wireless terminal in dBm. Operation proceeds from sub-step 6006 to sub-step 6008. In sub-step 6008, the wireless terminal proceeds to different sub-steps depending upon whether the wireless terminal is in a full-tone DCCH mode of operation or a split-tone DCCH mode of operation. If the wireless terminal is in full-tone DCCH mode of operation, operation proceeds from sub-step 6008 to sub-step 6010. If the wireless terminal is in split-tone DCCH mode of operation, operation proceeds from sub-step 6008 to sub-step 6012. In sub-step 6010, the wireless terminal generates a power report in accordance with a first format, e.g., a 5 information bit power report. For example the result of sub-step 6006 is compared to a plurality of different levels, each level corresponding to a different 5 bit pattern, the level closet to the result of sub-step 6006 is selected for the report, and the bit pattern corresponding to that level is used for the report. In one exemplary embodiment, the levels range from 6.5dBs to 40dBs. (See Figure 26.) In sub-step 6012 the wireless terminal generates a power report in accordance with a second format, e.g., a 4 information bit power report. For example the result of sub-step 6006 is compared to a plurality of different levels, each level corresponding to a different 4 bit pattern, the level closet to the result of sub-step 6006 is selected for the report, and the bit pattern corresponding to that level is used for the report. In one exemplary embodiment, the levels range from 6dBs to 36dBs. (See Figure 35.) Operation proceeds from step 6004 to step 6014.<br>
[00361]      In step 6014, the wireless terminal is operated to transmit the generated power report to a base station. Step 6014 includes sub-steps 6016,6018, 6020, 6022, and 6028. In sub-step 6016, the wireless terminal proceeds to different sub-steps depending upon whether the wireless terminal is in a full-tone DCCH mode of operation or a split-tone DCCH mode of operation. If the wireless terminal is in full-tone DCCH mode of operation, operation proceeds from sub-step 6016 to sub-step 6018. If the wireless terminal is in split-tone DCCH mode of operation, operation proceeds from sub-step 6016 to sub-step 6020.<br>

[00362]      In sub-step 6018, the wireless terminal combines the generated power report with additional information bit(s), e.g., 1 additional information bit, and jointly codes the set of combined information bits, e.g., set of 6 information bits, to generate a set of modulation symbols for a DCCH segment, e.g., a set of 21 modulation symbols. For example, the 1 additional information bit is, in some embodiments, a single information bit uplink traffic channel resource request report. In sub-step 6020, the wireless terminal combines the generated power report with additional information bit(s), e.g., 4 additional information bits, and jointly codes the set of combined information bits, e.g., set of 8 information bits, to generate a set of modulation symbols for a DCCH segment, e.g., a set of 21 modulation symbols. For example, the set of 4 additional information bit is, in some embodiments, a 4 information bit uplink traffic channel resource request report Operation proceeds from sub-step 6018 or sub-step 6020 to sub-step 6022.<br>
[00363]      In sub-step 6022, the wireless terminal determines the single OFDM tone used during each of a plurality of consecutive OFDM symbol transmission time periods for the DCCH segment. Sub-step 6022 includes sub-step 6024 and sub-step 6026. In sub-step 6024, the wireless terminal determines the logical DCCH channel tone assigned to the wireless terminal, and in sub-step 6026, the wireless terminal determines a physical tone to which the logical DCCH channel tone corresponds at different points in time based on tone hopping information. For example, in some embodiments, an exemplary DCCH segment corresponds to a single DCCH channel logical tone and the DCCH segment includes 21 OFDM tone-symbols, one OFDM tone-symbol for each of the 21 consecutive OFDM symbol transmissi6n time intervals, the same physical tone used for a first set of seven, a second physical tone used for a second set of seven, and a third physical tone used for a third set of seven. Operation proceeds from sub-step 6022 to sub-step 6028. In sub-step 6028, the wireless terminal, for each OFDM symbol transmission time period, corresponding to the DCCH segment, transmits a modulation symbol from the set of generated modulation symbols using the determined physical tone for that point in time.<br>
[00364]      Operation proceeds from step 6014 to step 6004, where the wireless terminal proceeds to generate another power report: In some embodiments, the power report is transmitted twice during each recurring cycle of a dedicated control channel<br>
SUBSTITUTE SHEET (RULE 26)<br><br><br>
WO 2007/075773<br><br>

reporting structure used to.control transmission of control information by the wireless terminal. In some embodiments, the power report is transmitted, on average at least once every 500 OFDM symbol transmission time periods but on average at intervals spaced apart by at least 200 symbol transmission time intervals.<br>
[00365]      Various features of an exemplary embodiment will now be described. The wireless terminal (WT) uses an ULRQST1, ULRQST3 or ULRQST4 to report the status of the MAC frame queues at the WT transmitter.<br>
[00366]      The WT transmitter maintains MAC frame queues, which buffers the MAC frames to be transmitted over the link. The MAC frames are converted from the LLC frames, which are constructed from packets of upper layer protocols. An uplink user data packet belongs to one of 4 request groups. A packet is associated with a particular request group. If the packet belongs to one request group, then each of the MAC frames of that packet also belong to that request group.<br>
J00367] The WT reports the number of MAC frames in the 4 request groups that the WT may intend to transmit. In the ARQ protocol, those MAC frames are marked as "new" or "to be retransmitted".<br>
[00368]      The WT maintains a vector of four elements N[0:3]: for k=0:3, N[k] represents the number of MAC frames that the WT intends to transmit in request group k. The WT reports the information about N[0:3] to the base station sector (BSS) so that the BSS can utilize the information in an uplink (UL) scheduling algorithm to determine the assignment of uplink traffic channel (UL.TCH) segments.<br>
[00369]      In an exemplary embodiment, the WT uses an ULRQST1 to report N[0]+N[1 ] according to Table 6100 of Figure 61. Table 6100 is an exemplary format for an ULRQSTl report. First column 6102 indicates the two possible bit patterns that may be conveyed while second column 6104 indicates me meaning of each bit pattern. If the bit pattern is 0, that indicates that there are no MAC frames that the WT intends to transmit in either request group 0 or request group 1. If the bit pattern is 1, that<br>
SUBSTITUTE SHEET (RULE 26)<br><br><br>
WO 2007/075773<br><br>
PCT/US2006/048584<br><br>
indicates that the WT has at least one MAC frame in request group 0 or request group 1 that the WT intends to communicate.<br>
[00370]      At a given time, the WT uses only one request dictionary. When the WT just enters the ACTIVE state, the WT uses the default request dictionary. To change the request dictionary, the WT and the BSS uses an upper layer configuration protocol. When the WT migrates from the ON state to the HOLD state, the WT keeps the last request dictionary used in the ON state so that when the WT migrates from the HOLD state to the ON state later, the WT continues to use the same request dictionary until the request dictionary is explicitly changed. However, if the WT leaves the ACTIVE state, then the memory of the last request dictionary used is cleared.<br>
[00371]      To determine an ULRQST3 or ULRQST4, the WT first calculates the following two parameters, y and z, and then use one of the following dictionaries. Denote by x the value (in dB) of the most recent 5 bit uplink transmission power backoff report (ULTXBKF5) report, and by bo the value in (dB) of the most recent generic 4 bit downlink beacon ratio report (DLBNR4). The WT further determines an adjusted generic DLBNR4 report value b as follows: b= bo-<br>
ulTCHrateFlashAssignmentOffset, where minus is defined in the dB sense. The base station sector broadcasts the value of ulTCHrateFlashAssignmentOffset in a downlink broadcast channel. The WT uses ulTCHrateFlashAssignmentOffset equal to OdB until the WT receives the value from the broadcast channel.<br>
[00372]      Figure 62 is an exemplary table 6200 used to calculate control parameters y and z. First column 6202 lists a condition; second column 6204 lists the corresponding value of output control parameter y; third column 6206 lists the corresponding value of output control parameter z. Given x and b, the WT determines y and z as those from the first row in Table 6200 of Figure 62 for which the condition in the first column is satisfied. For example, if x =17 and b=3, then z=min(4,Nmax) and y=l. Denote Rmax the highest rate option that the WT can support, and Nmax the number of MAC frames of that highest rate option.<br>

[00373]      The WT uses an ULRQST3 or ULRQST4 to report the actual N[0:3] of the MAC frame queues according to a request dictionary. A request dictionary is identified by a request dictionary (RD) reference number.<br>
[00374]      The exemplary request dictionaries show that any ULRQST4 or ULRQST3 report may not completely include the actual N[0:3]. A report is in effect a quantized version of the actual N[0:3], A general guideline is that the WT should send a report to minimize the discrepancy between the reported and the actual MAC frames queues first for request groups 0 and 1, and then for request group 2, and finally for request group 3. However, the WT has the flexibility of determining a report to benefit the WT the most. For example, when the WT is using the request dictionary 2, the WT may use an ULRQST4 to report N[l]+N[3] and use an ULRQST3 to report N[2]. In addition, if a report is directly related to a subset of request groups according to the request dictionary, it does not automatically imply that the MAC frame queues of a remaining request group are empty. For example, if a report means N[2]=l, then it may not automatically imply that N[0]=0, N[ 1 ]=0, or N[3] =0.<br>
[00375]      Table 6300 of Figure 63 and Table 6400 of Figure 64 define an exemplary request dictionary with the RD reference number equal to 0. Define d123=ceil(((N[l]+N[2]+N[3]-N123,min)/(y*g)),whereN123,min and g are variables detennined by the most recent ULRQST4 report as per Table 6300. Figure 63 is a table 6300 identifying bit format and interpretations associated with each of 16 bit patterns for a four bit uplink request, ULRQST4, corresponding to an exemplary first request dictionary (RD reference number = 0). In some embodiments, the request dictionary with reference number = 0 is the default request dictionary. First column 6302 identifies the bit pattern and bit ordering, most significant bit to least significant bit. Second column 6304 identifies the interpretation associated with each bit pattern.

Stored transmission backlog reporting schedule information includes information identifying the location of each of transmission backlog reports, e.g., the location of theULRQST], ULRQST3, and ULRQST4 reports in Figure 10. The stored transmission backlog reporting scheduling information 7281 is used by the transmission backlog report control module 7230 in determining when to transmit a report of a particular bit size. The stored transmission backlog reporting schedule information 7281 includes I bit size report information 7282, 3 bit size report information 7284, and 4 bit size report information 7286. For example, with respect to Figure 10, 1 bit size report information 7282 includes information identifying that an ULRQST1 report corresponds to the LSB of DCCH segment with index s2 = 0; 3 bit size report information 7284 includes information identifying that an ULRQST3 report corresponds to the 3 LSBs of DCCH segment with index s2 = 2; 4 bit size report information 7286 includes information identifying that an ULRQST4 report corresponds to the 4 LSBs of DCCH segment with index s2 = 4.<br>
[00408]      The stored transmission backlog scheduling information 7281 indicates that more I bit size backlog reports are to be transmitted than 3 bit size backlog reports in one iteration of the transmission report schedule. The stored transmission backlog scheduling information 7281 also indicates that more or the same number of 3 bit size backlog reports are to be transmitted than 4 bit size backlog reports in one iteration of the transmission report schedule. For example, in Figure 10, there are 16 identified ULRQST1 reports, 12 identified ULRQST3 reports, and 9 identified ULRQST4 reports. In this exemplary embodiment corresponding to Figure 10, the flexible reports, Body 4 reports, may convey a 4 bit ULRQST report, and under a case where the 3 flexible reports, of one iteration of the reporting structure, carry a ULRQST4 report, the wireless terminal communicates 12 ULRQST4 reports.<br>

Stored transmission backlog mapping information 7288 includes information indicating a mapping between queue status information and bit patterns that can be communicated using the different bit size backlog reports. In this exemplary embodiment, the 1 bit size backlog report provides backlog information corresponding to a plurality of different transmission queues; the one bit indicates the existence of information to be transmitted or lack thereof corresponding to the combination of request group 0 and request group 1. In various embodiments, the smallest bit size, e.g., 1 bit size, backlog report is used for highest priority traffic, e.g., where the highest priority is voice or control traffic. In some embodiments, the second bit size report, e.g., the 3 bit size report, communicates a delta, with respect to a previously communicated third bit size report, e.g., 4 bit size report; Figures 63 and 64 illustrates such a relationship, In some embodiments, the second fixed size report, e.g., the 3 bit size report, provides information on two sets of queues. For example, consider Figure 41, the second type of report communicates infonnation on a second set of queues and a third set of queues. In various embodiments, the third size report, e.g., the 4 bit size report, provides information on one set of queues. In some such embodiments, the one set of queues includes one request group queue, two request group queues, or three request group queues. In some embodiments, there are predetermined number of request groups for uplink traffic, e.g., four, RGO, RG1, RG2, and RG3, and a third fixed size report, e.g., the four bit size report is capable of communicating backlog information corresponding to any of the different request group queues. For example, consider Figure 41, a third type report communicates information on one of a fourth set of queues, a fifth set of queues, a sixth set of queues or a seventh set of queues, and for any given dictionary the third type of report is capable of communicating information pertaining to RGO, RG1, RG2, and RG3.<br>

[00411]      Figure 74 is a drawing of an exemplary wireless terminal 7400, e.g., mobile node, implemented in accordance with various embodiments. Exemplary wireless terminal 7400 may be any of the wireless terminals of Figure 1. Exemplary wireless terminal 7400 includes a receiver module 7402, a transmitter module 7404, a processor 7406, user I/O devices 7408, and memory 7410 coupled together via a bus 7412 over which the various elements interchange data and information.<br>
[00412]      Memory 7410 includes routines 7418 and data/information 7420. The processor 7406, e.g., a CPU, executes the routines 7418 and uses the data/information 7420 in memory 7410 to control the operation of the wireless terminal 7400 and implement methods. User I/O devices 7408, e.g., microphone, keyboard, keypad, switches, camera, display, speaker, etc., are used to input user data, output user data, allow a user to control applications, and/or control various functions of the wireless terminal, e.g., initiate a communications session.<br>
[00413]      Receiver module 7402, e.g., an OFDM receiver, is coupled to a receive antenna 7403 via which the wireless terminal 7400 receives downlink signals from base stations. Received downlink signals include, e.g., beacon signals, pilot signals, downlink traffic channel signals, power control signals including closed loop power control signals, timing control signals, assignment signals, registration response signals, and signals including base station assigned wireless terminal identifiers, e.g., an ON state identifier associated with a DCCH logical channel tone. Receiver module 7402 includes a decoder 7414 used to decode at least some of the received downlink signals.<br>
[00414]      Transmitter module 7404, e.g., an OFDM transmitter, is coupled to a transmit antenna 7405 via which the wireless terminal 7400 transmits uplink signals to base stations. In some embodiments, the same antenna is used for receiver and transmitter, e.g., the antenna is coupled through a duplexer module to receiver module 7402 and transmitter module 7404. Uplink signals include, e.g., registration request signals, dedicated control channel segment signals, e.g., conveying a reference signal which can be measured by a base station and reports including WT power reports such as a WT transmission power backoff report, and uplink traffic channel segment signals. Transmitter module 7404 includes an encoder 7416 used to encode at least some of the<br>

uplink signals. DCCH segments, in this embodiment, are encoded on a per segment<br>
basis.<br>
[00415]      Routines 7418 includes a communications routine 7422 and wireless terminal control routines 7422. The communications routine 7422 implements the various communications protocols used by the wireless terminal 7400. Wireless terminal control routines 7422 include a report generation module 7426, a wireless terminal transmission power control module 7430, a dedicated control channel control module 7432, a tone hopping module 7434, and a report format control module 7436. Report generation module 7426 includes a computation sub-module 7428.<br>
[00416]     Report generation module 7426 generates power reports, e.g., wireless terminal transmission power backoff reports, each power report indicating a ratio of a maximum transmit power of the wireless terminal to the transmit power of a reference signal having a power level known to the wireless terminal at a point in time corresponding to the power report. Wireless terminal transmission power control module 7430 is used for controlling the wireless terminal's transmission power level based on information including at least one closed loop power level control signal received from a base station. The closed loop power control signal received from the base station may be a signal used to control the wireless terminal transmitter power so that a desired received power level is achieved at the base station. In some embodiments, the base station does not have actual knowledge of the wireless terminals actual transmission power level and/or maximum transmit power level. In some system implementations different devices may have different maximum transmit power levels, e.g., a desk top wireless terminal may have a different maximum transmission power capability than a portable notebook computer implemented wireless terminal, e.g., operating off battery power.<br>
[00417]       Wireless terminal transmission power control module 7430 performs closed loop power control adjustments of a transmission power level associated with the dedicated control channel. Dedicated control channel control module 7432 determines which single logical tone in a plurality of logical tones is to be used for the dedicated control channel signaling, said single logical tone being dedicated to the wireless<br>

terminal for use in transmitting control signaling using a set of dedicated control channel segments.<br>
[00418]      Tone hopping module 7434 determines at different points in time a single physical OFDM tone to be used to communicate dedicated control channel information during a plurality of consecutive OFDM symbol transmission time intervals. For example, in one exemplary embodiments, a dedicated control channel segment corresponding to a single dedicated control channel logical tone includes 21 OFDM tone-symbol, the 21 OFDM tone-symbols comprising three sets of 7. OFDM tone-symbols, each set of seven OFDM tone-symbols corresponding to a half-slot of seven consecutive OFDM symbol transmission time periods and corresponding to a physical OFDM tone, each.of the three sets may correspond to a different physical OFDM tone with the OFDM tone for a set being determined in accordance with tone hopping information. Report format control module 7436 controls the format of the power report as a function of which one of a plurality of dedicated control channel modes of operation is being used by the wireless terminal 7400 at the time the report is transmitted. For example, in one exemplary embodiment, the wireless terminal uses a 5 bit format for the power report when in a full-tone DCCH mode of operation and uses a 4 bit power report when in a split-tone mode of operation.<br>
[00419]      Computation sub-module 7428 subtracts a per-tone transmission power of an uplink dedicated control channel in dBm from a maximum transmission power of the wireless terminal in dBm. In some embodiments, the maximum transmission power is a set value, e.g., a predetermined value stored in the wireless terminal or a value communicated to the wireless terminal, e.g., from a base station, and stored in the wireless terminal. In some embodiments, the maximum transmission power depends on a power output capacity of the wireless terminal. In some embodiments, the maximum transmission power is dependent upon the type of wireless terminal. In some embodiments, the maximum transmission power is dependent upon a mode of operation of the wireless terminal, e.g., with different modes corresponding to at least two of the following: operation using an external power source, operation using a battery, operation using a battery having a first level of energy reserve, operation using a battery having a second level of energy reserve, operation using a battery with an expected<br>
SUBSTTTUTE SHEET (RULE 26)<br>

amount of energy reserve to support a first duration of operational time, operation using a battery with an expected amount of energy reserve to support a second duration of operational time, operation in a normal power mode, operation in a power saving mode said maximum transmit power in the power saving mode being lower than said maximum transmit power in said normal power mode. In various embodiments, the maximum transmission power value is a value which has been selected to be in compliance with a government regulation limiting the maximum output power level of the wireless terminal, e.g., the maximum transmission power value is selected to be the maximum permissible level. Different devices may have different maximum power level capabilities which may or may not be known to a base station. The base station can, and in some embodiments does, use the backoff report in determining the supportable uplink traffic channel data throughput, e.g., per transmission segment throughput,:which can be supported by the wireless terminal. This is because the backoff report provides information about the additional power which can be used for traffic channel transmissions even though the base station may not know the actual transmission power level being used or the maximum capability of the wireless terminal since the backoff report is provided in the form of a ratio.<br>
[00420]      In some embodiments the wireless terminal can support one or more wireless connections at the same time, each connection having a corresponding maximum transmission power level. The maximum transmission power levels, indicated by values, may be different for different connections. In addition, for a given connection the maximum transmission power level may vary over time, e.g., as the number of connections being supported by the wireless terminal varies. Thus, it may be noted that even if the base station knew the maximum transmission power capability of a wireless terminal, the base station may not be aware of the number of communications links being supported by the wireless terminal at a particular point in time. However, the backoff report provides information which informs the base station about the available power for a given connection without requiring the base station to know about other possible existing connections which may be consuming power resources.<br>

uplink control information reports via dedicated control channel segment signals. The various uplink control information reports include a wireless terminal transmission power report, e.g., a WT transmission power backoff report, and other addition control information reports, e.g., uplink traffic channel request reports, interference reports, SNR reports, self-noise reports, etc.<br>
[00429]     Each small shaded circle, e.g., circle 7506, is used to represent the transmission power level of the dedicated control channel at a corresponding point in time. For example, each point in time, in some embodiments, corresponds to an OFDM symbol transmission time interval and the identified power level is the power level associated with the modulation symbol corresponding to the single tone of the WTs DCCH channel during that OFDM symbol transmission time interval. In some embodiments, each point in time, corresponds to a dwell, e.g., representing a fixed number, e.g., seven, of consecutive OFDM symbol transmission time periods using the same physical tone for the wireless terminal's DCCH channel.<br>

[00432]      In addition to the DCCH control channel which is used.in various embodiments for wireless terminals in an ON state, it should be appreciated that the system also supports additional dedicated uplink control signaling channels, e.g., timing control channels and/or state transition request channels which may be dedicated to a wireless terminal. These additional channels may exist in the case of the hold state in addition to the ON state with terminals in the ON-State being provided the DCCH control channel in addition to the timing and state transition request channels. Signaling on the timing control and/or state transition request channels occurs at a much lower rate than signaling on the DCCH control channel, e.g., at rate 1/5 or less from the wireless terminals perspective. In some embodiments, the dedicated uplink channels provided in the hold state based on Active user IDs assigned by the base station attachment point while DCCH channel resources are allocated by the base station attachment point based on information including an ON state identifier assigned by the base station attachment point.<br>
[00433]      Figure 76 is a drawing of a flowchart 7600 of an exemplary method of operating a wireless terminal in accordance with various embodiments. The exemplary method starts in step 7602 where the wireless terminal is powered on and initialized. Operation proceeds from start step 7602 to step 7604. In step 7604 the wireless tenninal determines if it is operating in a first or second mode of control channel operation and proceeds differently depending upon the determination. In various embodiments, the first and second modes of control channel operation are first and second dedicated control channel modes of operation. In some such embodiments, the first dedicated control channel mode of operation is a mode, e.g., a full-tone mode of operation, in which the wireless terminal is dedicated a single logical tone of a dedicated control channel, and the second mode of dedicated control channel operation is a split-tone mode of operation in which the wireless terminal is dedicated a single logical tone of a dedicated control channel on a time shared basis, the dedicated logical tone being used in a time shared manner to the exclusion of at least one other wireless terminal which is dedicated the logical tone for periods of time which do not overlap the periods of time in which said logical tone is dedicated to the wireless terminal. If the wireless terminal is operating in a first mode of control channel operation, operation proceeds<br>

from step 7604 to step 7606; however, if the wireless terminal determines that it is operating in a second mode of control channel operation, operation proceeds from step 7604 to step 7608.<br>
[00434]      In step 7606, the wireless terminal determines modulation symbols to be transmitted in accordance with a first information bit to modulation symbol mapping procedure. Step 7606 includes step 7612. In step 7612, the wireless terminal is operated to generate X modulation symbols from M information bits, where X is a positive integer greater than M. Step 7612 includes sub-steps 7614, 7616 and 7618. In sub-step 7614, the wireless terminal is operated to partition the M information bits into first and second subsets of bits of equal size. Operation proceeds from sub-step 7614 to . sub-step 7616. In sub-step 7616, the wireless terminal is operated to generate a third set of bits as a function of the first and second subsets ofbits, the third set of bits being the same size as the first and second subsets of bits. In some embodiments, the function of sub-step 7616 includes performing a bit wise exclusive OR operation. Operation proceeds from sub-step 7616 to sub-step 7618. In sub-step 7618, the wireless terminal determines, for each of said first subset of information bits, second subset of information bits, and third set of bits, using a first mapping function, an equal number of said X modulation symbols, the first mapping function used to determine each of said equal number of X modulation symbols being the same. In one exemplary embodiment, the first mapping function implements the bit to coded modulation symbol table 3700 of Figure 37.<br>
[00435]      In step 7608, the wireless terminal determines modulation symbols to be transmitted in accordance with a second information bit to modulation symbol mapping procedure. Step 7608 includes step 7620. In step 7620, the wireless terminal is operated to generate X modulation symbols from N information bits, where X is a positive integer greater than M and N is greater than M. Step 7620 includes sub-steps 7622,7624 and 7626. In sub-step 7622, the wireless terminal is operated to partition the N information bits into fourth and fifth subsets of bits of equal size. Operation proceeds from sub-step 7622 to sub-step 7624. In sub-step 7624, the wireless terminal is operated to generate a sixth set of bits as a function of the fourth and fifth subsets of bits, the sixth set of bits being the same size as the fourth and fifth subsets of bits.

some embodiments, the function of sub-step 7624 includes performing a bit wise exclusive OR operation. Operation proceeds from sub-step 7624 to sub-step 7626. In sub-step 7626, the wireless terminal determines, for each of said fourth subset of information bits, fifth subset of information bits, and sixth set of bits, using a second mapping function, an equal number of said X modulation symbols, the second mapping function used to determine each of said equal number of X modulation symbols being the same. In one exemplary embodiment, the second mapping function implements the bit to coded modulation symbol table 3800 of Figure 38.<br>
[00436]      Operation proceeds from step 7606 or step 7608 to step 7610. In step 7610, the wireless terminal transmits the generated set of X modulation symbols in a control channel segment, the control channel segment being the same size in both first and second modes of control channel operation. In various embodiments, the modulation symbols are modulation symbols transmitted on individual tones, e.g., each modulation symbol of the set of X modulation symbols corresponds to a different OFDM tone-symbol, a tone-symbol being the air link resources of one (one for Che duration of one OFDM symbol transmission time interval. Operation proceeds from step 7610 back to step 7604, where the wireless terminal can repeat the method for another control channel segment to be transmitted.<br>
[00437]      In various embodiments, X is a multiple of three and M and N are even positive integers. In one such embodiment X is 21, M is 6 and N is 8. Note that in an exemplary embodiment, in split-tone format dedicated control channel mode the wireless terminal is allocated less dedicated control channel segments per unit time than in the full-tone mode, and the coding and modulation procedures have been adjusted to carry more information bits per segment in the split-tone mode where the allocated resources are fewer.<br>
[00438]      In some embodiments, tone hopping is used. In some such embodiments, the single logical channel tone of the control channel being used by the wireless terminal, e.g., dedicated control channel logical tone, is tone hopped according to a tone hopping schedule but remains the same for the period of time used to transmit one of the equal number of modulation symbols. For example, in an exemplary<br>

embodiment, a dedicated control channel segment conveying 21 modulation symbols over 21 OFDM symbol transmission time intervals uses 3 dwells, each dwell comprising seven successive OFDM symbol transmission time intervals and the physical tone used during a dwell is the same but may change in accordance with tone hopping from on dwell to another. This approach advantageously places the modulation symbols, e.g., 7 modulation symbols, associated with one of a first subset, second subset, third set, fourth subset, fifth subset, and sixth set, on a single physical tone, but facilitates diversity by implementing a hopping scheme which can have different physical tones, e.g., 3 different physical tones used for the segment.<br>

In this exemplary embodiment, the first control channel mode of operation is a full-tone fomiat DCCH mode of operation and the second control channel mode of operation is a split-tone format DCCH mode of operation. The full-tone format mode of operation is a mode of operation in which the wireless terminal is dedicated a single logical tone of a dedicated control channel.

[00446|      The 1st mode modulation symbol determination module 7736 determines modulation symbols to be transmitted in accordance with a first information bit to modulation symbol mapping procedure which generates X modulation symbols from M information bits where X is a positive integer greater than M. The 2nd mode modulation symbol determination module 7738 determines modulation symbols to be transmitted in accordance with a second information bit to modulation symbol mapping procedure which generates X modulation symbols from N information bits where X is a positive integer greater than N, and wherein N is greater than M. In various embodiments, X is a multiple of three and M and N are even positive integers. In one exemplary embodiment X =21, M=6 and N=8.<br>

[00450]      Tone hoping module 7730 determines, according to a tone hopping function, at different points in time, a physical tone corresponding to a single logical tone. For example, a single DCCH logical tone identified in information 7788 corresponds to physical tones identified in information (7792, 7794, 7796), respectively for (first, second, and third) dwells corresponding to DCCH segment 1.<br>
[00451]      Modulation symbol to transmission segment mapping module 7734 assigns, each set of generated modulations symbols, e.g., a set of 21 modulation symbols, to a control channel segment, e.g. dedicated control channel segment, the dedicated control channel segments used during both the first and second modes of operation being the same size. For example, an exemplary dedicated control channel segment has 21 OFDM tone-symbols, each OFDM tone symbol corresponding to the air link resource of one tone for the duration of one OFDM symbol transmission time interval, each of the 21 OFDM tone-symbol of the DCCH segment being used to convey one of the 21 modulation symbols of the segment.<br>

[00454]     Data/information 7720 includes, at times when in the split-tone format DCCH mode, a plurality of sets of N input bits of information, e.g., where N =8, (set 1 of N information bits 7768,..., set n of N input bits 7776), each set corresponding to the information bits of dedicated control channel reports to be communicated in an uplink dedicated control channel segment in the split-tone mode format of operation. Sets of N input information bits (7768, 7776) represent input to 2nd partitioning module 7746. Data/information 7720 also includes a plurality of subsets of information bits representing the partition of the information of a set of input information bits (7768, 7776) as output from 2nd partitioning module 7746. For example bit subset 4 7770.and bit subset 5 7771, e.g., each having 4 bits, corresponds to set 1 of N information bits 7768.

DCCH mode of operation information 7786 includes information identifying whether the wireless terminal is operating in the full-tone format DCCH mode or split-tone format DCCH mode of operation. DCCH logical tone information 7788 includes information identifying which DCCH logical tone in a channel structure has been allocated by the base station to the wireless terminal and, when in a split tone format DCCH mode of operation information identifying which of the DCCH segments associated with the allocated logical tone have been allocated to the wireless terminal. In some embodiments a base station assigned ON state identifier is used to indicate the logical DCCH tone assigned to the wireless terminal. DCCH segment 1 physical tone information 7790 includes a physical tone associated with the assigned DCCH logical tone for DCCH segment 1. For example, the exemplary embodiment uses tone hopping in which the single DCCH logical tone assigned to the wireless terminal corresponding to a connection is associated with a physical tone for the duration of a dwell, e.g., 7 OFDM symbol transmission time intervals, and then the physical tone can be changed, in accordance with the tone hopping. Thus the single logical tone identified in information 7788 is associated with physical tone 1 7792 for a first dwell, physical tone 2 7794 for a second dwell, and physical tone 3 7790 for a third dwell.

The coding/modulation method is intentionally structured such that modulation symbols, e.g., 7 modulation symbols corresponding to bits from a subset or set, e.g., one of 7754, 7756, 7758, 7770, 7771, 7772, are associated with a single physical tone.

[00458]      Figure 78 is a drawing of a flowchart 7800 of an exemplary method of operating a base station in accordance with various embodiments. Operation starts in step 7802, where the base station is powered on and initialized. Operation proceeds from start step 7802 to steps 7804, 7806, and 7808.<br>
[00459]       In step 7804, the base station assigns uplink control channel resources to wireless terminals. For example, in step 7804, the base station may assign uplink dedicated control channel segments to wireless terminals using the base station as their current attachment point In different modes of wireless terminal control channel operation, e.g., full tone format mode vs split-tone format mode, a wireless terminal is allocated by the base station different amounts of dedicated control channel resources, e.g., different numbers of dedicated control channel segments over the same time interval. In some embodiments, the base station assigns a wireless terminal a wireless terminal On state identifier which is associated, e.g., by predetermined association, with<br>

a logical uplink control channel tone to be used by the wireless terminal to communicate uplink dedicated control channel segment signals. The operations of step 7804 are performed on an ongoing basis, e.g., as new wireless terminals request to be transitioned into an On state of operation, as currently assigned wireless terminals no longer request and/or need to be in an On state of operation, and/or as the base station readjusts allocation among the various wireless terminals competing for resources. Wireless terminal control channel assignment information (WT 1 current control channel assignment information 7805,... WT N current control channel assignment information 7807) is output from step 7804 and used as input to step 7808.<br>
[00460]      In step 7806, the base station stores information indicating the mode of control channel operation in which wireless terminals are operating. Step 7806 is performed on an ongoing basis. For example, for each wireless terminal assigned in step 7804 to use uplink dedicated control channel segments, the wireless terminal is in one of a first control channel mode of operation, e.g., a full-tone format mode of operation, or a second control channel mode of operation, e.g., a split-tone format mode of operation. Wireless terminal control channel mode information (WT 1 current control channel mode 7809,... WT N current control channel mode 7811) is output from step 7806 and used as input to step 7812.<br>
[00461]      Steps 7808, 7810, and 7812 are performed for each of one or more wireless terminals transmitting control channel reports, e.g., uplink dedicated control channel reports using dedicated control channel segments, to the base station. In step 7808, the base station determines, in accordance with base station control channel assignment information a logical uplink control channel tone being used by an individual wireless terminal at points in time. Operation proceeds from step 7808 to step 7810.<br>
[00462]     In step 7810, the base station determines, in accordance with uplink tone hopping information, a tone assigned to the individual wireless terminal at different points in time to communicate control channel reports. For example, in one embodiment, corresponding to one uplink dedicated control channel segment, one logical tone is assigned for three dwells, each dwell having a duration of seven<br>

[00463]      In step 7812, the base station determines whether the wireless terminal under consideration is in a first mode of control channel operation, e.g., a full tone format mode of operation, or a second mode of control channel operation, e.g., a split-tone format mode of control channel operation. If the wireless terminal is in a first mode of operation, operation proceeds from step 7812 to step 7814; if the wireless terminal is in a second mode of operation, operation proceeds from step 7812 to step 7816.<br>
[00464]      In step 7814, the base station recovers modulation symbols communicated using a first information bit to modulation symbol mapping procedure. In step 7816, the base station recovers modulation symbols communicated using a second information bit to modulation symbol mapping procedure.<br>
[00465]      In some embodiments, recovering modulation symbols communicated in accordance with a first information bit to modulation symbol mapping procedure when in a first mode of control channel operation includes performing the inverse of: generating X modulation symbols from M information bits where X is a positive integer greater than M, and recovering modulation symbols communicated in accordance with a second information bit to modulation symbol mapping procedure includes performing the inverse of: generating X modulation symbols from N information bits where X is a positive integer greater than N, and wherein N is greater than M. In some exemplary embodiments, X is a multiple of three and M and N are even positive integers. In one exemplary embodiment X =21, M = 6 and N = 8.<br>
[00466]      In one exemplary embodiment, the recovery operation of step 7914 performs the inverse of the operations of step 4306 of Figure 43, while the recovery operation of step 7916 performs the inverse of the operations of step 4308 of Figure 43.<br>

[00467]      In various embodiments, modulation symbols are modulation symbols transmitted on individual tones. For example, a dedicated control channel segment of 21 OFDM tone-symbols for which a recovery operation of step 7814 or step 7816 is to be applied to recover a set of 21 modulation symbols, one modulation symbol per tone per OFDM symbol transmission time period of the dedicated control channel segment.
