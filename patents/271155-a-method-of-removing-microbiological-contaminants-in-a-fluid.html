The present invention is directed to filter media having microbiological<br>
Interception capability, filtration systems containing such filter media, and<br>
methods of making and using same.<br>
Modern consumer water filters often provide 'health claims" including<br>
reduction of particulates, heavy metals, toxic organic chemicals, and select<br>
microbiological threats. These filtration systems have been able to intercept<br>
microorganisms such as Cryptosporidium and Giardia using roughly 1.0<br>
micron structures. However, in order to provide microbiological interception<br>
of even smaller microbiological threats such as viruses, a filter medium having<br>
a sub-micron microporous structure is required. Prior art filtration systems<br>
often attempt to achieve broad microbiological interception using filter media<br>
with insufficiently small pore size and with poor physical integrity. The<br>
balance between the necessary pore structure required for successful<br>
microbiological interception and satisfactory filter performance has not been<br>
achieved. In addition, prior art systems did not provided devices capable of<br>
operating in the presence of "interferences* consisting of substances that cause<br>
a loss of filtration performance.<br>

The Microbiological Interception Enhanced Filter Medium<br>
A filter medium of the present invention includes a microporous<br>
structure that provides microbiological interception capability using a<br>
combination of an appropriate pore structure and a chemical treatment. The<br>
microporous structure comprises any material that is capable of having a mean<br>
flow path of less than about 2.0 microns. Preferably, the microporous<br>
structure comprises nanofibers formed into a nonwoven or paper-like<br>
structure, but may include whiskers, or be a membrane. The tight pore<br>
structure of the microbiological interception enhanced filter medium of the<br>
present invention provides short diffusion distances from the fluid to the<br>
surface of the filter medium. The chemical treatment process used to treat the<br>
surface of the microporous structure utilizes a synergistic interaction between a<br>
cationic material and a biologically active metal, that when combined, provide<br>
broad-spectrum reduction of microbiological contaminants on contact. The<br>
charge provided by the cationic material to the filter medium aids in electro-<br>
kinetic interception of microbiological contaminants, while the tight pore<br>
structure provides a short diffusion path and, therefore, rapid diffusion kinetics<br>
of contaminants in a flowing fluid to the surface of the microporous structure.<br>
The microporous structure also provides supplemental direct mechanical<br>
interception of microbiological contaminants. Due to the dominant role of<br>
diffusion for the interception of extremely small particles, there is a direct<br>
correlation between the log reduction value of viral particles and the contact<br>
time of the influent within the filter medium, rather than a dependence upon<br>
the thickness of the filter medium.<br><br>
10<br>
Characteristics of the Microbiological Interception Enhanced Filter<br>
Medium<br>
In order to provide full microbiological interception capability, the<br>
microbiological interception enhanced filter medium of the present invention<br>
has a mean flow path of less than about 2 microns, and preferably less than or<br>
equal to about 1 micron, and more preferably less than or equal to about 0.6<br>
microns. The volume of the microbiological interception enhanced filter<br>
medium of the present invention compared to the flow rate of fluid through<br>
the filter medium must be sufficient to provide a contact time adequate for the<br>
contaminants to diffuse to the surface of the filter medium. To provide<br>
enhanced electro-kinetic interception of microorganisms, of which the<br>
majority are negatively charged, under most conditions, the microbiological<br>
interception enhanced filter medium has a positive zeta potential generally<br>
greater than about +10 millivolts at pH values of about 6 to about 7, and<br>
retains a net positive zeta potential at pH values of about 9 or greater.<br>
Natural organic matter (NOM), such as polyanionic acids, i.e., humic<br>
acid or fulvic acid, that may reduce or remove the charge on the<br>
microbiological interception enhanced filter medium, is preferably prevented<br>
from contacting the charged microporous structure through the use of an<br>
adsorbent prefilter that substantially removes the NOM. When used in the<br>
context of a gravity-flow water filtration system, it is preferable that the<br>
microbiological interception enhanced filter medium be made with<br>
hydrophilic materials to provide good, spontaneous wettability. Alternatively,<br>
in other applications, the microbiological interception enhanced filter medium<br>
may be treated to provide either a hydrophilic or hydrophobic characteristic as<br>
needed. It is possible that the microbiological interception enhanced filter<br>
medium can have both positively and negatively charged and uncharged<br>
regions, and/or hydrophilic and hydrophobic regions. For example, the<br>
negatively charged regions can be used to enhance the interception of less<br><br>
11<br>
common positively charged contaminants and uncharged hydrophobic regions<br>
can be used to provide enhanced interception of contaminants that are<br>
attracted to hydrophobic surfaces.<br>
The Fibers/Whiskers Or Particulate Ingredients<br>
The microbiological interception enhanced filter medium of the present<br>
invention includes a microporous structure that may include a plurality of<br>
nanofibers, including whiskers or micro-particulate ingredients, of organic and<br>
inorganic materials including, but not limited to, polymers, ion-exchange<br>
resins, engineered resins, ceramics, cellulose, rayon, ramie, wool, silk, glass,<br>
metal, activated alumina, carbon or activated carbon, silica, zeolites,<br>
diatomaceous earth, activated bauxite, fuller's earth, calcium hydroxyappatite,<br>
other adsorbent materials, or combinations thereof. Combinations of organic<br>
and inorganic fibers and/or whiskers or micro-particules are contemplated and<br>
within the scope of the invention as for example, glass, ceramic, or metal<br>
! fibers and polymeric fibers may be used together with very small particles<br>
incorporated into the microporous structure.<br>
When produced by a wet laid process from nanofibers such as cellulose<br>
or polymer fibers, such fibers should also have a Canadian Standard Freeness<br>
of less than or equal to about 100, and most preferably less than or equal to<br>
) about 45. Preferably, a significant portion of the fibers should have a diameter<br>
less than or equal to about 1000 nanometers, more preferably less than or<br>
equal to about 400 nanometers, and fibers less than or equal to about 250<br>
nanometers in diameter are most preferred. It is preferable to chop the fibers<br>
to a length of about 1 millimeter to about 8 millimeters, preferably about 2<br>
5 millimeters to about 6 millimeters, and more preferably about 3 millimeters to<br>
about 4 millimeters. Fibriilated fibers are most preferred due to their<br>
exceptionally fine dimensions and potentially low cost<br>
Preferably, fibriilated synthetic cellulose fibers, processed in<br>
accordance with the present invention, can produce an ultra-fine, hydrophilic<br><br>
12<br>
microporous structure for use as the microbiological interception enhanced<br>
filter medium of the present invention. Such fibrillated cellulose fibers can be<br>
made by direct dissolution and spinning of wood pulp in an organic solvent,<br>
such as an amine oxide, and are known as lyocell fibers. Lyocell fibers have<br>
the advantage of being produced in a consistent, uniform manner, thus<br>
yielding reproducible results, which may not be the case for, for example,<br>
natural cellulose fibers. Further, the fibrils of lyocell are often curled. The<br>
curls provide a significant amount of fiber entanglement, resulting in a finished<br>
filter medium with high dry strength and significant residual wet strength.<br>
Furthermore, the fibrillated lyocell fibers may be produced in large quantities<br>
using equipment of modest capital cost. It will be understood that fibers other<br>
than cellulose may be fibrillated to produce extremely fine fibrils, such as for<br>
example, artificial fibers, in particular, acrylic or nylon fibers, or other natural<br>
cellulosic materials. Combinations of fibrillated and non-fibrillated fibers may<br>
be used in the microporous structure.<br>
Membranes<br>
The microbiological interception enhanced filter medium of the present<br>
. invention can comprise a membrane of organic or inorganic composition<br>
including, but not limited to, polymers, ion-exchange resins, engineered<br>
resins, ceramics, cellulose, rayon, ramie, wool, silk, glass, metal, activated<br>
alumina, activated carbon, silica, zeolites, diatomaceous earth, activated<br>
bauxite, fuller's earth, calcium hydroxyappatite, titanates and other materials,<br>
or combinations thereof. Combinations of organic and inorganic materials are<br>
contemplated and within the scope of the invention. Such membranes may be<br>

The Microbiological Interception Enhancing Agent<br>
The nanofibers or membrane that make up the microporous structure<br>
are chemically treated with a microbiological interception enhancing agent<br>
capable of creating a positive charge on the microbiological interception<br><br>
13<br>
enhanced filter medium. A cationic metal complex is formed on at least a<br>
portion of the surface of at least some of the fibers or the membrane by treating<br>
the fibers or membrane with a cationic material. The cationic material may be<br>
a small charged molecule or a linear or branched polymer having positively<br>
charged atoms along the length of the polymer chain.<br>
If the cationic material is a polymer, the charge density is preferably<br>
greater than about 1 charged atom per about every 20 Angstroms, preferably<br>
greater than about 1 charged atom per about every 12 Angstroms, and more<br>
preferably greater than about 1 charged atom per about every 10 Angstroms of<br>
molecular length. The higher the charge density on the cationic material, the<br>
higher the concentration of the counter ion associated therewith. A high<br>
concentration of an appropriate counter ion can be used to drive the<br>
precipitation of a cationic metal complex. The cationic material should<br>
consistently provide a highly positively charged surface to the microporous<br>
structure as determined by a streaming or zeta potential analyzer, whether in a<br>
high or low pH environment. Zeta or streaming potentials of the microporous<br>
structure after treatment with a high molecular weight charged polymer can be<br>
greater than about +10 millivolts, and often up to about +23 millivolts at a<br>
substantially neutral pH.<br>
The cationic material includes, but is not limited to, quaternized<br>
amines, quaternized amides, quaternary ammonium salts, quaternized imides,<br>
benzalkonium compounds, biguanides, cationic aminosilicon compounds,<br>
cationic cellulose derivatives, cationic starches, quaternized polyglycol amine<br>
condensates, quaternized collagen polypeptides, cationic chitin derivatives,<br>
cationic guar gum, colloids such as cationic melamine-formaldehyde acid<br>
colloids, inorganic treated silica colloids, polyamide-epichlorohydrin resin,<br>
cationic acrylamides, polymers and copolymers thereof, combinations thereof,<br>
and the like. Charged molecules useful for this application can be small<br>
molecules with a single charged unit and capable of being attached to at least<br><br>
14<br>
a portion of the microporous structure. The cationic material preferably has<br>
one or more counter ions associated therewith which, when exposed to a<br>
biologically active metal salt solution, cause preferential precipitation of the<br>
metal in proximity to the cationic surface to form a cationic metal precipitate.<br>
Exemplary of amines may be pyrroles, eplchlorohydrin derived amines,<br>
polymers thereof, and the like. Exemplary of amides may be those polyamides<br>
disclosed in International Patent Application No. WO 01/07090, and the like.<br>
Exemplary of quaternary ammonium salts may be homopolymers of diallyl<br>
dimethyl ammonium halide, epichlorohydrin derived polyquaternary amine<br>
polymers, quaternary ammonium salts derived from diamines and dihalides<br>
such as those disclosed in United States Patent Nos. 2,261,002, 2,271,378,<br>
2,388,614, and 2,454,547, all of which are incorporated by reference, and in<br>
International Patent Application No. WO 97/23594, also incorporated by<br>
reference, polyhexamethylenedimethylammonium bromide, and the like. The<br>
cationic material may be chemically bonded, adsorbed, or crosslinked to itself<br>
or to the fiber or membrane.<br>
Furthermore, other materials suitable for use as the cationic material<br>
include BIOSHIELD® available from BioShield Technologies, Inc., Norcross,<br>
Georgia. BIOSHIELD® is an organosilane product including approximately 5%<br>
by weight octadecylaminodimethyltrirnethoxysilylpropyl ammonium chloride<br>
and less than 3% chloropropyltrimethoxysilane. Another material that may be<br>
used is SURFACINE®, available from Surfacine Development Company LLC,<br>
Tyngsboro, Massachusetts. SURFACINE® comprises a three-dimensional<br>
polymeric network obtained by reacting poly(hexamethylenebiguanide)<br>
(PHMB) with 4,4'-meth!yene-bis-N,N-diglycidylaniline (MBGDA), a<br>
crosslinking agent, to covalently bond the PHMB to a polymeric surface.<br>
Silver, in the form of silver iodide, is introduced into the network, and is<br>
trapped as submicron-sized particles. The combination is an effective biocide,<br>
which may be used in the present invention. Depending upon the fiber and<br><br>
15<br>
membrane material, the MBGDA may or may not crosslink the PHMB to the<br>
fiber or the membrane.<br>
The cationic material is exposed to a biologically active metal salt<br>
solution such that the cationic metal complex precipitates onto at least a<br>
portion of the surface of at least some of the fibers or the membrane. For this<br>
purpose, the metals that are biologically active are preferred. Such<br>
biologically active metals include, but are not limited to, silver, copper, zinc,<br>
cadmium, mercury, antimony, gold, aluminum, platinum, palladium, and<br>
combinations thereof. Most preferred are silver and copper. The biologically<br>
active metal salt solution is preferably selected such that the metal and the<br>
counter ion of the cationic material are substantially insoluble in an aqueous<br>
environment to drive precipitation of the cationic metal complex.<br>
A particularly useful microbiological interception enhancing agent Is a<br>
cationic silver-amine-halide complex. The cationic amine is preferably a<br>
homopolymer of diallyl dimethyl ammonium halide having a molecular<br>
weight of about 400,000 Daltons or other quaternary ammonium salts having<br>
a similar charge density and molecular weight. A homopolymer of diallyl<br>
dimethyl ammonium chloride useful in the present invention is commercially<br>
available from Nalco Chemical Company of Naperville, Illinois, under the<br>
tradename MERQUAT® 100. The chloride counter ion may be replaced with a<br>
bromide or iodide counter ion. When contacted with a silver nitrate solution,<br>
the silver-amine halide complex precipitates on at least a portion of the fibers<br>
or membrane of the microporous structure of the filter medium.<br>
The pH of the surrounding solution does affect the zeta potential of the<br>
microbiological interception enhanced filter medium of the present invention.<br>
An acidic pH will increase the charge on the filter medium while a basic pH<br>
will decrease the charge on the filter medium. Under pH conditions typically<br>
encountered in potable water, the microbiological interception enhanced filter<br>
medium does retain a minimum positive charge and only at very high pH<br><br>
16<br>
values does the charge decline below zero millivolts. Exposure to NOM, such<br>
as polyanionic acids, will decrease the zeta potential of the microbiological<br>
interception enhanced filter medium. This will diminish its microbiological<br>
interception capabilities. Therefore, in applications where high levels of NOM<br>
are present, an adsorbent prefilter capable of removing the NOM extends the<br>
useful life of the microbiological interception enhanced filter medium.<br>
Methods Of Making The Microbiological Interception Enhanced Filter Medium<br>
The microbiological interception enhanced filter medium may be made<br>
in accordance with processes known to one of skill in the art. Dry laid<br>
processes include spun bonding, electrospinning, spinning islands-in-sea<br>
processes, fibrillated films, melt blowing, and other dry laid processes known<br>
to one of skill in the art. An exemplary dry laid process starts with staple<br>
fibers, which can be separated by carding into individual fibers and are then<br>
laid together to a desired thickness by an aerodynamic or hydrodynamic<br>
process to form an unbonded fiber sheet. The unbonded fibers can then be<br>
subjected to hydraulic jets to both fibrillate and hydroentangle the fibers. A<br>
similar process can be performed on certain plastic films that when exposed to<br>
high pressure jets of water, are converted into webs of fibrillated fibers.<br>
In a preferred wet laid process, a fiber tow is chopped to a specific<br>
length, usually in the range of about 1 millimeter to about 8 millimeters, and<br>
in particular in the range of about 3 millimeters to about 4 millimeters. The<br>
chopped fibers are fibrillated in a device having characteristics similar to a<br>
blender, or on a large scale, in machines commonly referred to as a *hi-low", a<br>
"beater* or a 'refiner'. The fiber is subjected to repetitive stresses, while<br>
further chopping and the reduction of fiber length is minimized. As the fibers<br>
undergo these stresses, the fibers split as a result of weaknesses between<br>
amorphous and crystalline regions and the Canadian Standard Freeness (CSF),<br>
which is determined by a method well known in the art, begins to decline.<br><br>
17<br>
Samples of the resulting pulp can be removed at Intervals, and the CSF used as<br>
an indirect measure of the extent of fibrillation. While the CSF value is slightly<br>
responsive to fiber length, it is strongly responsive to the degree of fiber<br>
fibrillation. Thus, the CSF, which is a measure of how easily water may be<br>
removed from the pulp, is a suitable means of monitoring the degree of fiber<br>
fibrillation. If the surface area is very high, then very little water will be<br>
drained from the pulp in a given amount of time and the CSF value will<br>
become progressively lower as the fibers fibrillate more extensively. The<br>
fibrillated fiber of a given CSF value can be directly used for producing paper<br>
or dewatered on a variety of different devices, including a dewatering press or<br>
belt, to produce a dewatered pulp. The dewatered pulp can be subsequently<br>
used to make a wet-laid paper. Generally, for application in the present<br>
invention, a pulp with a CSF of below 100 is used, and preferably, the CSF<br>
should be less than or equal to about 45.<br>
The pulp is treated with a cationic material in such a manner as to<br>
allow the cationic material to coat at least a portion of the surface of at least<br>
some of the fibers thereby imparting a charge on the fibers. Methods of<br>
applying the cationic material to the fibers are known in the art and include,<br>
but are not limited to, spray, dip, or submergence coating to cause adsorption,<br>
chemical reaction or crosslinking of the cationic material to the surface of the<br>
fibers. The treated pulp is then rinsed in reverse osmosis/deionized (RO/DI)<br>
water, partially dewatered, usually under vacuum, to produce a wet lap that<br>
can then be exposed to a biologically active metal salt solution. The( use of .<br>
nearly ion-free rinse water causes the counter-ions associated with the cationic<br>
material to be drawn tightly against the treated fiber surface and to eliminate<br>
unwanted ions that may cause uncontrolled precipitation of the biologically<br>
active metal into sites remote from the cationic surface.<br>
The metal salt solution is infiltrated into the fibers to allow precipitation<br>
of the cationic metal complex on a surface of at least a portion of the fibers.<br><br>
18<br>
The precipitation accurately deposits a metal colloid adjacent to the cationic<br>
coating because the counter-ion associated with this coating reacts with the<br>
applied metai salt to form colloidal particles. After sufficient exposure to the<br>
biologically active metal salt solution, the fibers can be rinsed and excess<br>
water is removed. Alternatively, the fibers can be directly sent to pulp<br>
preparation systems to create a furnish suitable for paper making.<br>
When silver nitrate is used as the metal salt solution, the presence of<br>
precipitated silver can be confirmed by using a Kratos EDX-700/800 X-ray<br>
fluorescence spectrometer available from Kratos Analytical, a Shimadzu Group<br>
Company, Japan.<br>
The microbiological interception enhanced filter medium comprising a<br>
membrane may be made in accordance with processes known to one of skill<br>
in the art. Raw material for the membrane may be treated prior to forming the<br>
membrane or the cationic material may be applied to the membrane material<br>
using known methods in the art and similar to those used to treat the fiber<br>
surfaces.<br>
Additives<br>
The strength of the wet laid fiber sheet, especially when wet, may be<br>
improved with the addition of various additives. It is well known in the art<br>
that the addition of epoxy or acrylic or other resins to the paper making<br>
process can provide enhanced wet strength, but these water-dispersed resins<br>
often cause lower permeability to the final product, especially as fiber size<br>
becomes very small. Although these resins and resin systems can be used in<br>
the current invention, it is preferable to use thermoplastic or thermoset<br>
materials known in the art, and in either powder, particulate or fiber form.<br>
Useful binder materials include, but are not limited to, polyolefins,<br>
polyvinyl halides, polyvinyl esters, polyvinyl ethers, polyvinyl sulfates,<br>
polyvinyl phosphates, polyvinyl amines, polyamides, polyimides,<br>

thereof, and combinations thereof. Variations of the above materials and other<br>

lower alky! groups, lower alkoxy groups, monocyclic aryl groups, and the like.<br>
Other potentially applicable materials include polymers such as polystyrenes<br>
and acrylonitrile-styrene copolymers, styrene-butadiene copolymers, and other<br>
non-crystalline or amorphous polymers and structures.<br>
A more detailed list of binder materials that may be useful in the<br>
present invention include end-capped polyacetals, such as poly(oxymethylene)<br>
or polyformaldehyde, poly(trichloroacetaldehyde), poly(n-valeraldehyde),<br>

polyacrylamide, poly(acrylic acid), poly(methacrylic acid), poly(ethyl acrylate),<br>
and poly(methyl methacrylate); fluorocarbon polymers, such as<br>
poly(tetrafluoroethylene), perfluorinated ethylene-propylene copolymers,<br>
ethylene-tetrafluoroethylene copolymers, poly(chlorotrifluoroethyIene),<br>
ethylene-chlorotrifluoroethylene copolymers, polyvinylidene fluoride), and<br>
polyvinyl fluoride); polyamides, such as poly(6-aminocaproic acid) or poly(e-<br>
caprolactam), poly(hexamethylene adipamide), po!y(hexamethylene<br>
sebacamide), and poly(11-aminoundecanoic acid); polyaramides, such as<br>
poly(imino-1,3-phenyleneiminoisophthaloyl)	or	poly(m-phenylene<br>
isophthalamide); parylenes, such as poly-2-xylylene, and poly(chloro-1-<br>
xylylene); polyaryl ethers, such as poly(oxy-2,6-dimethyl-1,4-phenylene) or<br>
poly(p-phenylene oxide); polyaryl sulfones, such as ,poly(oxy-1,4-<br>
phenylenesulfonyl-1,4-phenyleneoxy-1,4-phenyl-eneisopropylide	ne-1,4-<br>
phenylene), and poly(sulfonyl-1,4-phenylene-oxy-1,4-phenylenesulfonyl4,4'-<br>
biphenylene); polycarbonates, such as poly-(bisphenol A) or<br>
poly(carbonyldioxy-1,4-phenyleneisopropylidene-1,4-phenylene); polyesters,<br><br>
20<br>
such as polyethylene terephthalate), poly(tetramethy!ene terephthalate), and<br>
poly(cyclohexyl-ene-1,4-dimethylene terephthalate) or poly(oxymethylene-1,4;<br>
cyclohexylenemethyleneoxyterephthaloyl); polyaryl sulfides, such as poly(p-<br>
phenylene sulfide) or poly(thio-1,4-phenylene); polyimides, such as<br>
poly(pyromeIlitimido-1,4-phenylene); polyolefins, such as polyethylene,<br>
polypropylene, poly(l-butene), poly(2-butene), poly(l-pentene), poly(2-<br>
pentene), poly(3-methy!-1-pentene), and poly(4-methyl-1-pentene); vinyl<br>
polymers, such as polyvinyl acetate), poly(vinylidene chloride), and poly(vinyl<br>
chloride); diene polymers, such as 1,2-po!y-1,3-butadiene, 1,4-poly-1,3-<br>
butadiene, polyisopre'ne, and polychloroprene; polystyrenes; and copolymers<br>
of the foregoing, such as acrylonitrilebutadiene-styrene (ABS) copolymers.<br>
Polyolefins that may be useful include polyethylene, linear low density,<br>
polyethylene, polypropylene, poly(l-butene), poly(2-butene), poly(l-pentene),<br>
poly(2-pentene), poly(3-methyl-1-pentene), poly(4-methyl-1-pentene), and the<br>
like.<br>
A range of binder fibers, including polyethylene, polypropylene,<br>
acrylic, or polyester-polypropylene or polypropylene-polyethylene bi-<br>
component fibers, or others can be used. Certain types of treated polyethylene<br>
fibers, when properly treated, as described below, are optimal, and have the<br>
additional benefit of not significantly interfering with the hydrophilic nature of<br>
the resulting filter medium when used in modest volumes. Preferred fiber<br>
binder materials may include FYBREL® synthetic fibers and/or SHORT STUFF®<br>
EST-8, both of which are polyolefin based. FYBREL® is a polyolefin based<br>
synthetic pulp that is a highly fibrillated fiber and is commercially available<br>
from Mitsui Chemical Company, Japan. FYBREL® has excellent thermal<br>
moldability and provides a smooth surface to the filter medium. SHORT<br>
STUFF® EST-8 is commercially available from MiniFibers, Inc., Pittsburgh,<br>
Pennsylvania, and is a highly fibrillated, high density polyethylene.<br><br>
21<br>
Preferably, the binder material is present in an amount of about 1 % to<br>
about 10% by weight, more preferably about 3% to,about 6%, and most<br>
preferably about 5%. It is preferable that the binder material have a softening<br>
point that is significantly lower than a softening point of the nanofiber material<br>
so that the filter medium can be heated to activate the binder material, while<br>
the microporous structure does not melt and thereby lose porosity.<br>
One or more additives either in a particulate, fiber, whisker, or powder<br>
form may also be mixed with the nanofibers or incorporated into the<br>
membrane to aid in adsorption of other contaminants or participate in the<br>
i formation of the microporous structure and interception of microbiological<br>
contaminants. Useful additives may include, but are not limited to, metallic<br>
particles, activated alumina, activated carbon, silica, polymeric powders and<br>
fibers, glass beads or fibers, cellulose fibers, ion-exchange resins, engineered<br>
resins, ceramics, zeolites, diatomaceous earth, activated bauxite, fuller's earth,<br>
i calcium sulfate, other adsorbent materials such as super adsorbent polymers<br>
(SAPs), or combinations thereof. The additives can also be chemically treated<br>
to impart microbiological interception capabilities depending upon the<br>
particular application. Such additives are preferably present in a sufficient<br>
amount such that the fluid flow in the resultant filter medium is not<br>
) substantially impeded when used in filtration applications. The amount of<br>
additives is dependent upon the particular use of the filtration system.<br>
Exemplary of a wet laid process includes mixing a pulp of 45 CSF<br>
fibrillated lyocell fibers with 5% EST-8 binder fibers and dispersing the pulp<br>
and binder fibers in deionized water with mixing in a blender to form a furnish<br>
5 with about 1% to about 2% consistency. To this mixture is added about 3%<br>
by weight of MERQUAT® 100, which is briefly dispersed into the dilute pulp<br>
furnish. The cationic material remains in contact with the pulp for about 4 to<br>
about 12 hours until a significant portion has been adsorbed onto at least a<br>
portion of the fibers to impart and maintain a positive zeta potential on the<br><br>
22<br>
fibers. Within about eight hours at room temperature, sufficient MERQUAT®<br>
is adsorbed to provide a positive zeta potential on the fibers that is greater than<br>
about +10 millivolts. Next, this pulp is partially dewatered under vacuum<br>
and rinsed with deionized water to form a wet lap. A metal salt solution, such<br>
as, for example, silver nitrate, in an amount equal to 0.5% by weight of the dry<br>
nanofibers, is prepared with deionized water, and uniformly poured over the<br>
sheet and allowed to stand for a short time to allow precipitation of the<br>
biologically active metal with at least a portion of the counter ion associated<br>
with the cationic material. Thereafter, the fibers can be directly used in the<br>
production of wet laid filter medium.<br>
Filtration Systems Utilizing the Microbiological Interception Enhanced Filter<br>
Medium<br>
Many types of filtration systems incorporating the current filter medium<br>
can be imagined. Described below are certain specific embodiments.<br>
However, these filtration systems are exemplary and should not be construed<br>
as restricting the scope of the invention.<br>
Precoat Filtration Systems Including Microbiological Interception<br>
Enhanced Nanofiber<br>
One filtration system of the present invention that utilizes nanofibers<br>
treated with the microbiological interception enhancing agent, is an industrial,<br>
commercial or municipal filter that uses a precoat applied to a porous septa.<br>
This coating is produced by dispersing particles such as diatomaceous earth,<br>
perlite or fibers as a precoat applied to the porous septa for filtering liquids<br>
such as beer, wine, juices, and other liquids used in the food service or<br>
pharmaceutical industry. As the liquid contacts the filter cake, unwanted<br>
contaminants are removed while also clarifying the liquid. The charged<br>
nanofibers not only remove negatively charged contaminants in the liquid<br>
much smaller than the pores of the precoat but greatly improve the mechanical<br><br>
23<br>
interception of all particles. The nanofibers may be used in conjunction with<br>
traditional precoat ingredients such as diatomaceous earth. Only a small<br>
amount of nanofibers are needed in the precoat, generally about 1.5% to<br>
about 10% by weight, to produce a significant effect. Preferably, a hydrophilic<br>
microbiological interception enhanced filter medium is used in these<br>
applications.<br>
Filtration Systems Involving Multiple Layers Of Filter Medium<br>
A microbiological interception enhanced filter medium of the present<br>
invention can include configurations having more than one layer of the<br>
microbiological interception enhanced filter medium. A first microbiological<br>
interception enhanced filter medium layer may be positively charged while a<br>
second layer may be negatively charged. The negatively charged material can<br>
be produced by contacting the nanofibers pulp with a negatively charged<br>
compound or material such as a polycarboxylic acid mixed with a small<br>
quantity of a crossiinking agent such as a glycerine. Heating the nanofibers<br>
after soaking in such a mixture results in the formation of a coating on the<br>
nanofibers of negatively charged carboxylic acid polymer crosslinked by the<br>
glycerine. The multi-layer microbiological interception enhanced filtration<br>
system is capable of intercepting both positively and negatively charged<br>
microbiological targets. Again, in applications where NOM is present, an<br>
adsorbent prefilter may be needed to preserve the charge on the<br>
microbiological interception enhanced filter medium.<br>
Filtration Systems With An Adsorbent Prefilter Combined With The<br>
Microbiological Interception Enhanced Filter Medium<br>
A microporous filter medium of the present invention treated with the<br>
microbiological interception enhancing agent may be used as a flat sheet<br>
medium, a pleated medium, or as a spiral wound medium depending upon the<br>
application and the filter housing design. It may be used for just about any<br>
type of fluid filtration including water and air.<br><br>
24<br>
However, the microbiological interception enhanced filter medium<br>
may be less effective in the presence of moderate to high levels of NOM such<br>
as polyanionic humic acid and fulvic acid, due to the decrease and eventual<br>
loss of positive charge on the filter medium in the presence of such acids.<br>
Therefore, such applications utilizing the microbiological interception<br>
enhanced filter medium alone should be substantially free of or have low<br>
levels of polyanionic acids.<br>
In filtration systems containing the microbiological interception<br>
enhanced filter medium that may come in contact with fluids that contain<br>
NOM, it is prudent to use an adsorbent prefilter to remove the NOM in the<br>
influent prior to it contacting the microbiological interception enhanced filter<br>
medium. Alternatively, the positively charged filter medium can be formed<br>
into a multitude of layers either as a stack of sheets or by conversion into a<br>
structure. Under this type of arrangement, the outer layers of the filter medium<br>
can be sacrificed to remove the NOM, while the inner layers are protected and<br>
provide long-term reduction of microbiological contaminants. Additives that<br>
adsorb or absorb NOM may be incorporated into the microporous structure,<br>
including anion exchange resins. To avoid this costly loss of sacrificial<br>
material, the following examples describe other alternative methods for<br>
arranging the protection of the filter medium from the effects of NOM.<br>
1. A Flat Adsorbent Filter Medium As A Prefilter<br>
The microbiological interception enhanced filter medium may be used<br>
in conjunction with adsorbent filtration media that serve to intercept NOM<br>
Interferences prior to their contact with the charged microbiological<br>
interception enhanced filter medium. The microbiological interception<br>
enhanced filter medium and one or more layers of an adsorbent filtration<br>
medium may be used as a flat sheet composite, spiral wound together, or<br>
pleated together. Such an adsorbent filtration medium may be manufactured<br>
according to United States Patent Nos. 5,792,513 and 6,077,588, as well as<br><br>
25<br>
other processes in the prior art. A particularly suitable flat sheet adsorbent<br>
filtration medium is commercially available as PLEKX® from KX Industries,<br>
LP., Orange, Connecticut. The flat sheet filtration medium may contain<br>
hydrophilic or hydrophobic particles that can also be treated with the<br>
microbiological interception enhancing agent, although not necessary, and<br>
immobilized on a substrate to provide added microbiological interception<br>
capabilities in addition to that provided by the microbiological interception<br>
enhanced filter medium. At least one adsorbent layer is preferably placed<br>
upstream from the microbiological interception enhanced filter medium to<br>
reduce the deleterious effects of NOM on the microbiological interception<br>
enhanced filter medium. The microbiological interception enhanced filter<br>
medium can serve as one of the substrates used to support the adsorbent used<br>
to filter NOM from the influent fluid. For example, the upper layer of the<br>
PLEKX® structure can be a particulate.prefiIter. The core of the PLEKX®<br>
composite can be primarily composed of an adsorbent with a high affinity for<br>
NOM, and the lower, downstream layer can be the microbiological<br>
interception enhanced filter medium. The layers can be bonded into a single<br>
cohesive composite structure using the PLEKX® process described in the<br>
above-mentioned patents. The result is a hgh dirt capacity filter structure that<br>
provides chemical, particulate, and microbiological interception in a single<br>
material. The core of the PLEKX® structure can include a wide range of<br>
ingredients useful for the adsorption of chemical contaminants.<br>
2. GAC Filter Medium As An Adsorbent Prefilter<br>
The microbiological interception enhanced filter medium may also be<br>
used in conjunction with a bed of granular adsorbent such as, for example, a<br>
granular activated carbon (GAC) bed. The granular bed filter should be placed<br>
upstream from the microbiological interception enhanced filter medium to<br>
remove any charge-reducing contaminants, such as NOM, from the influent<br>
prior to contacting the charged microporous filter medium.<br><br>
26<br>
3. Solid Composite Block Filter Medium As An Adsorbent Prefilter<br>
The microbiological interception enhanced filter medium may also be<br>
used in conjunction with a solid composite block filter medium, preferably<br>
comprising activated carbon, placed upstream from the microbiological<br>
interception enhanced filter medium to remove any charge-reducing<br>
contaminants, such as NOM, from the influent prior to contact with the<br>
microbiological interception enhanced filter medium. The activated carbon<br>
block may include, but is not limited to, such materials as activated alumina,<br>
zeolites, diatomaceous earth, silicates, aluminosilicates, titanates, bone char,<br>
calcium hydroxyapatite, manganese oxides, iron oxides, magnesia, perlite,<br>
talc, polymeric particulates, clay, iodated resins, ion exchange resins,<br>
ceramics, and combinations thereof to provide additional reduction of<br>
contaminants such as heavy metals, arsenic, chlorine, and to improve taste and<br>
odor. These materials, as well as the activated carbon, may be treated with the<br>
microbiological interception enhancing agent prior to being converted into a<br>
solid composite by extrusion, compression molding or other processes known<br>
to one of skill in the art. Exemplary processes are described in United States<br>
Patent Nos. 5,019,311, and 5,189,092. The solid composite block can<br>
contain an anion-exchange resin that is specifically selected for its high<br>
capacity to adsorb NOM.<br>
Complete Filtration Devices Combining Adsorbent Prefilters And<br>
Microbiological Interception Enhanced Filter Medim<br>
One particular embodiment of a filtration system of the present<br>
invention includes a composite filter medium, as described above, including<br>
the microbiological interception enhanced filter medium and the adsorbent<br>
filtration medium. This device is designated to operate as a gravity flow device<br>
with a driving pressure of only a few inches water column to a maximum of a<br>
few feet of water column. The composite filter medium is forced to first pass<br>
through the adsorbent prefilter and then the microbiological interception layer.<br><br>
27<br>
As shown in Fig. 1, an exemplary filter design incorporates the composite filter<br>
medium of the present invention in a filter housing 10 having a clam shell type<br>
enclosure. Filter housing 10 has a top portion 12 having an inlet 14, and a<br>
bottom portion 16 having an outlet 18. Residing within a sealed cavity<br>
defined by the top portion and bottom portion is the composite filter medium<br>
20 shown more accurately in the cross sectional view of Fig. 2. Top portion<br>
12 and bottom portion 16 may be formed from a single sheet of a polymeric<br>
material and folded over to provide a clam shell configuration.<br>
To assemble the filter, composite filter medium 20 is cut into<br>
substantially the size and shape of the Clam shell enclosure. Composite filter<br>
medium 20 is secured into bottom portion 16 and top portion 12 is placed<br>
over bottom portion 16 and compressed together. The top and bottom shell<br>
portions 12, 16 may be welded together creating a weldment 22 around the<br>
entire periphery of filter medium 20. As illustrated in Fig. 2, there is shown a<br>
substantially impermeable interface between the top and bottom portions and<br>
the composite filter medium in the region directly adjacent weldment 22.<br>
Excess material on the clam shell enclosure and composite filter medium is<br>
simply cut off. It will be understood that other methods of sealing the filter<br>
medium within the filter housing may be used such as, but not limited to,<br>
adhesives, mechanical clamps, and the like. Although the filter design has a<br>
clam shell enclosure, the filter design is not limited to such. Any enclosure<br>
that may be sealed such that an influent will not bypass the filter medium<br>
would be suitable.<br>
In referring back to Fig. 2, the seal formed between composite filter<br>
medium 20 and top portion 12 and bottom portion 16 is such that water being<br>
filtered is forced to follow the path illustrated by arrows A and B, and cannot<br>
bypass composite filter medium 20. In fact, at the periphery of composite filter<br>
medium 20, the pressure exerted by the seal increases the density of the filter<br>
medium so that contact time of the water being filtered with composite filter<br><br>
28<br>
medium 20 in this peripheral region is increased and filtration efficiency<br>
enhanced.<br>
During production of the filter, assurances concerning the seal and<br>
assembly integrity may be obtained using a vision system, and gas or aerosol<br>
pulse testing. The gas or aerosol pulse test uses a tiny pulse of dilute butane or<br>
fog-oil smoke that is entirely adsorbed or intercepted by an intact filter, but<br>
will significantly penetrate a defective filter. Other off-line test procedures<br>
known to one of skill in the art may be used to methodically examine the<br>
quality of the seal between the filter medium and the enclosure.<br>
The wall of the filter housing may be sufficiently thin and flexible so<br>
that when the filter is contacted with water, the modest pressure produced by<br>
the hydrostatic load of the incoming water causes top portion 12 and bottom<br>
portion 16 to bow away slightly from and provide a clearance space between<br>
the inner surface of top portion 12 and bottom portion 16, and composite<br>
filter medium 20. This clearance space assists in distributing the water across<br>
the influent surface of composite filter medium 20 and provides drainage of<br>
the effluent into outlet 18.<br>
Referring to Fig. 3, there is shown a front plan view of a filtration<br>
system 30 of the present invention useful in providing potable water in a<br>
gravity flow device that may be useful in developing countries where safe,<br>
potable water of suitable microbiological quality is scarce. Although water is<br>
discussed as the liquid influent, it is within the scope of the invention to<br>
contemplate the filtration of other liquids. Filtration system 30 has a first<br>
reservoir 35 that is a raw water collection transport container. First reservoir<br>
35 may be a bag configuration as shown constructed of a substantially leak<br>
proof material such as a polymeric materia!, i.e., polyester, nylon, a polyolefin<br>
such as polyethylene, polyvinyl chloride, and multi-layer films of the like. For<br>
ease of use, first reservoir 35 may have a reinforced opening and a handle 36<br>
for carrying and hanging first reservoir 35 to provide a pressure head during<br><br>
29<br>
filtration. Preferably, first reservoir 35 has a resealable opening 37 that when<br>
closed provides a substantially water-tight seal. Such resealable openings are<br>
known to one of skill in the art or may include a threaded opening with a<br>
screw-on cap.<br>
First reservoir 35 is preferably equipped with an output hose 40 such<br>
that water stored in the reservoir may be drained for filtration and eventual<br>
use. Output hose 40 is preferably made with a food-safe grade of flexible<br>
polymer. Output hose 40 may be opened and closed using a simple clamp.<br>
Output hose 40 may be permanently attached to first reservoir 35 by ultrasonic<br>
welding or retained simply by friction. Output hose 40 preferably has an<br>
internal extension end 42 within first reservoir 35 such that internal extension<br>
end 42 extends above the bottom of the first reservoir 35 to provide an area for<br>
capturing sediment that can settle prior to water filtration. By limiting the<br>
amount of sediment present in the influent prior to water filtration, the useful<br>
life of the filtration system is prolonged.<br>
Output hose 40 connects first reservoir 35 to a filter 10, described<br>
above, including the composite filter medium of the present invention. A<br>
clamp 45 may be fitted on output hose 40 at any point along the length of<br>
output hose 40. Such clamps are well known in the art and may be a simple<br>
one piece configuration made of a flexible polymer or metal. When the clamp<br>
is in an open position, water from first reservoir 35 flows freely into filter 10.<br>
Filter 10 is removably connected to output hose 40. The outlet of filter 10 is<br>
then connected to a second reservoir 50. Second reservoir 50 serves as a<br>
collection vessel for the filtered water or effluent. Alternatively, filter 10 and<br>
second reservoir 50 may be connected together via a second output hose (not<br>
shown). Second reservoir 50 generally is equipped with a means for<br>
dispensing the filtered water.<br>
The above filtration system may be used as follows. A user takes first<br>
reservoir 35, with or without output hose 40 attached thereto, to a water<br><br>
30<br>
source. If output hose 40 is still attached to first reservoir 35, clamp 45 must<br>
be in a closed position or first reservoir 35 must be sealed by other means.<br>
First reservoir 35 is filled with a quantity of raw water and its opening again<br>
sealed while the user carries first reservoir 35 back to a preferred location such<br>
as a residence. It is possible that the raw water is contaminated with<br>
microorganisms and chemical contaminants and may not be potable. To<br>
facilitate filtration, first reservoir 35 is suspended or hung from a support<br>
means. Depending upon any significant sediment present as evidenced by<br>
turbidity, the raw water is allowed to remain suspended for a period of time<br>
sufficient for the sediment to settle below the height of internal extension end<br>
42 of output hose 40 within first reservoir 35. Of course, should the water be<br>
relatively clear, there is no need to suspend first reservoir 35 for such a period<br>
of time. Output hose 40 is attached to first reservoir 35, if previously<br>
detached, and secured to filter 10. Filter 10 is secured to second reservoir 50<br>
for collecting the filtered water. Clamp 45 is then placed in an open position<br>
and the water is allowed to flow into filter 10 wherein the water once treated<br>
through composite filter medium 20, is rendered potable, and collected in<br>
second reservoir 50. To preserve the potability of the filtered water, the<br>
surfaces of second reservoir 50 may be made from or treated with a<br>
disinfectant or with the microbiological interception enhancing agent.<br>
Preferably, the disinfectant used would not alter or affect the taste of the water.<br>
Typical water flow rates are about 25 to about 100 ml/minute for a<br>
device equipped with a filter of about 3*x5" size and operated at about 6"<br>
water column pressure. This provides one liter of potable water in about 10 to<br>
40 minutes having at least about 6 log reduction in bacteria and at least about<br>
4 log reduction in viral contaminants. Continual use of filter 10 will likely<br>
develop, by progressive deposition thereon, a layer of particles that will slow<br>
the flow rate until the filtration process takes an unacceptable amount of time.<br><br>
31<br>
Although the flow rate is diminished, the filter will maintain its microbiological<br>
interception capabilities for an extended period.<br>
Another gravity flow device incorporating a filter medium of the present<br>
invention includes an exemplary carafe design as illustrated in Fig. 4 for<br>
filtering, storing and dispensing filtered water or other fluids. Although the<br>
carafe shown is primarily round, the carafe 60 may assume any shape<br>
depending upon its use and environment, and is a matter of design choice. A<br>
basic carafe has a housing 62 with a handle 64 and cover 66. Carafe 60 is<br>
divided into a lower reservoir or storage chamber 68 and an upper reservoir<br>
78 that are enclosed by lid 70 and cover 66 located within housing 62. Spout<br>
72 facilitates the removal of filtered water through outlet 74 of storage<br>
chamber 68.<br>
Upper reservoir 78 and storage chamber 68 are separated by partition<br>
80 that is provided with a filter receiving receptacle 85 having an opening (not<br>
shown) in the bottom thereof. In one embodiment, a flat composite filter<br>
medium 76 of the present invention is placed into filter receiving receptacle<br>
85 with a water tight seal to segregate upper reservoir 78 and storage chamber<br>
68. Placement of filter medium 76 into filter receptacle 85 may be<br>
accomplished using means known to one of skill in the art including, but not<br>
limited to, a snap or hinged mechanism. Filter medium 76 is preferably<br>
manufactured as a replaceable cartridge. Other features of the carafe design<br>
may be incorporated into the present invention without departing from the<br>
scope of the invention. The filter medium may comprise any microporous<br>
structure having a mean flow path of less than about 1 micron and so treated<br>
as to provide at least about 4 log reduction of microbiological contaminants<br>
smaller than the mean flow path of the filter medium. Preferably, the filter<br>
medium has a volume of less than about 500 cm3 and has an initial flow rate<br>
of greater than about 25 ml/minute.<br><br>
32<br>
A user would pour raw water into upper reservoir 78 and allow the raw<br>
water to pass through filter medium 76 under the influence of gravity. Filtered<br>
water is collected in storage chamber 68. As the raw water passes through the<br>
filter medium of the present invention with sufficient contact time, the filter<br>
medium renders the water potable by providing a high titer reduction of<br>
microorganisms. The log reduction value (LRV) of microorganisms is<br>
dependent upon the contact time of the filter medium with the flowing water.<br>
To provide about 8 log reduction value of microorganisms, the required<br>
contact time is about 6 to about 10 seconds.<br>
Carafe 60 may also have an indicator (not shown) that allows a user to<br>
keep track of the age of the filter to gauge when the useful life of the filter<br>
medium has been expended. Other types of indicators may also be used such<br>
as an indicator for indicating the number of refills of carafe 60, for measuring<br>
the volume of water or liquid that passes through the filter medium, and the<br>
like.<br>
Other Filtration Systems<br>
A filter medium of the present invention, in particular, the composite<br>
filter medium, may also be incorporated into a point-of-use application such as<br>
a sports bottle design for use as a personal water filtration system operating<br>
under a slight pressure, about 1 psi. A suitable sports bottle design is disclosed<br>
in International Patent Application No. WO 01/23306 wherein the filter<br>
medium may be incorporated into the filter receptacle of the sports bottle.<br>
For other point-of-use applications, the microbiological interception<br>
enhanced filter medium of the present invention may further be incorporated<br>
into end-of-tap (EOT), under-sink, counter-top, or other common consumer or<br>
industrial filtration systems and configurations for use in pressurized systems.<br>
The filter system may include a prefilter comprising a bed of adsorbent<br>
particles or a solid adsorbent composite block. The microbiological<br>
interception enhanced filter medium can be a pleated or a spiral wound<br><br>
33<br>
construction, or formed into a thick mat by vacuum formation on a suitable<br>
mandrel to create a wet-formed or dry-formed cartridge.<br>
Examples<br>
The following examples are provided to illustrate the present invention<br>
and should not be construed as limiting the scope of the invention.<br>
Porometry studies were performed with an Automated Capillary Flow<br>
Porometer available from Porous Materials, Inc., Ithaca, New York.<br>
Parameters determined, using standard procedures published by the<br>
equipment manufacturer, include mean flow pore size and gas (air)<br>
permeability. The flow of air was assayed at variable pressure on both the dry<br>
and wet filter medium. Prior to wet runs, the filter medium was initially<br>
immersed in silicon oil for at least 10 minutes while held under high vacuum.<br>
Zeta or streaming potential of various filter media was determined using<br>
streaming potential and streaming current measured with a BI-EKA Electro-<br>
Kinetic Analyzer available from Brookhaven Instruments, of Holtsville, New<br>
York. This instrument includes an analyzer, a flat-sheet measuring cell,<br>
electrodes, and a data control system. The analyzer includes a pump to<br>
produce the pressure required to pass an electrolyte solution, generally<br>
0.0015M potassium chloride, from a reservoir, through the measuring cell<br>
containing a sample of the filter medium described herein. Sensors for<br>
measuring temperature, pressure drop, conductivity and pH are disposed<br>
externally of the cell. In accordance with this method the electrolyte solution<br>
is pumped through the porous material. As the electrolyte solution passes<br>
through the sample, a displacement of charge occurs. The resulting "streaming<br>
potential and/or streaming current" can be detected by means of the<br>
electrodes, placed at each end of the sample. The zeta (streaming) potential of<br>
the sample is then determined by a calculation according to the method of<br><br>
34<br>
Fairbrother and Mastin that takes into account the conductivity of the<br>
electrolyte.<br>
Bacterial challenges of the filter media were performed using<br>
suspensions of Escherichia coli of the American Type Culture Col lection<br>
(ATCQ No. 11775 to evaluate the response to a bacterial challenge. The<br>
response to viral challenges was evaluated using MS-2 bacteriophage ATTC<br>
No. 15597-B1. The Standard Operating Procedures of the ATCC were used<br>
for propagation of the bacterium and bacteriophage, and standard<br>
microbiological procedures, as well known in the art, were used for preparing<br>
and quantifying the microorganisms in both the influent and effluent of filters<br>
challenged with suspensions of the microbiological particles.<br>
Examples 1-3: Filter Medium Made With Untreated Lyocell Fibers<br>
(Comparative)<br>
Filter medium made from untreated lyocell fibers having a mean flow<br>
path of about 0.3 to about 0.6 microns were prepared in accordance with the<br>
following method.<br>
Dry EST-8 binder fibers having a weight of 0.45 g, commercially<br>
available from MiniFibers, Inc., was fully dispersed in 1.0 L of deionized water<br>
in a kitchen style blender on a pulse setting. Fibrillated lyocell fibers with a<br>
Canadian Standard Freeness of 45 and having a dry weight of 120.0 g were<br>
added as wet pulp to the dispersed binder fibers. The dispersed fiber mixture<br>
was blended for another 15 seconds. The fiber mixture was poured into a<br>
larger industrial Waring blender with an additional 1.0 L of deionized water<br>
and blended for an additional 15 to 30 seconds. The fiber mixture was poured<br>
into a 30.5 x 30.5 cm2 stainless steel FORMAX® paper deckle filled with about<br>
12.0 L of deionized water and fitted with a 100 mesh forming screen. A 30 x<br>
30 cm2 stainless steel agitator plate having 60 holes of 2 cm in diameter was<br>
used to plunge the fiber mixture up and down from top to bottom about 8 to<br>
10 times. The water was removed from the fiber mixture by pulling a slight<br><br>
35<br>
vacuum below the deckle to cause the fibers to form on the wire. Once the<br>
bulk of the water is removed, supplemental dewatering is accomplished with a<br>
vacuum pump to remove additional excess moisture and to create a relatively<br>
smooth, flat, fairly thin paper-like sheet. The resulting sheet is separated from<br>
the screen and combined with a blotter sheet on both top and bottom. The<br>
combination of sheets is gently rolled with a 2.27 kg marble rolling pin to<br>
remove excess water and smooth out the top surface of the sheet. The sheet is<br>
then placed between two fresh and dry blotter sheets and placed on a<br>
FORMAX® sheet dryer for about 10 to about 15 minutes at about 120°C. The<br>
dried filter medium is separated from the blotter sheets and directly heated on<br>
the FORMAX® sheet dryer for about 5 minutes on each side to activate the dry<br>
binder fibers.<br>
Table I shows the porometry and air permeability test results performed<br>
on filter medium made from untreated lyocell fibers of varying thicknesses<br>
made using the above process.<br>

The resulting filter medium made with untreated lyocell fibers had a<br>
reproducible streaming potential of about-9.0 millivolts.<br>
Example 4: Filter Medium Made With Lyocell Fibers Treated With The<br>
Microbiological Interception Enhancing Agent<br>
To a blender were added 12.0 g dry weight lyocell fibers as a 10% by<br>
weight wet pulp having a Canadian Standard Freeness of about 45, 0.45 g<br><br>
&gt; 36<br>
SHORT STUFF® EST-8 binder fibers, and 1.0 L deionized water. The mixture<br>
was blended until the fibers were fully dispersed. To the blender was added<br>
3.0 ml of MERQUAT® 100 as a 30% aqueous solution and the fibers blended<br>
with the MERQUAT® 100 for about 10 seconds and left to stand for at least<br>
about 6 hours. After about 6 hours, the fibers were poured into a standard 8<br>
inch Brit jar fitted with a 100 mesh forming wire and excess water removed<br>
under vacuum. The resulting pulp sheet was rinsed with 500 ml of deionized<br>
water. The excess water was again removed by vacuum.<br>
A dilute silver nitrate solution was poured uniformly over the pulp sheet<br>
to provide full exposure and saturation, providing about 0.1425 g of silver per<br>
sheet. The silver nitrate solution was left on the pulp sheet for at least about<br>
15 minutes and excess water removed under vacuum pressure. The silver-<br>
treated pulp sheet was then torn into small pieces and placed in a WARING®<br>
blender and re-dispersed in 2.0 L of deionized water. A second 3.0 ml portion<br>
of the MERQUAT® 100 solution was added to the dispersion and the mixture<br>
blended for about 10 minutes and the contents poured into a 30.5 x 30.5 cm2<br>
stainless steel FORMAX® paper deckle fitted with a 100 mesh forming screen.<br>
Paper-like sheets of the microbiological interception enhanced filter medium<br>
were made in the same manner as the untreated lyocell filter media described<br>
in Examples 1 to 3.<br>
The zeta potential of the filter medium was consistently greater than<br>
about +10 millivolts at a pH of about 7.0.<br>
Examples 5-23: Comparison Of Microbiological Interception With The<br>
Microbiological Interception Enhanced Filter Medium Of The Present<br>
Invention And The Untreated Lyocell Filter Medium<br>
Sheets of fibrillated lyocell filter medium either untreated or treated<br>
with MERQUAT® 100 and silver, as described in Examples 1 to 4, were folded<br>
twice and cut into standard cone-shaped funnels and placed into small<br><br>
37<br>
sterilized glass funnels. Deionized water was used to pre-wet each filter<br>
medium. Approximately 125 ml of various microbiological challenges were<br>
poured through the filters and the effluents collected in sterile 250 ml<br>
Erlenmeyer flasks. The effluents were subjected to serial dilution in duplicate<br>
and plated on petri dishes following standard laboratory procedures as<br>
required for each organism and left overnight in 37°C heated incubators. The<br>
next day all test results were recorded. Table II summarizes the log reduction<br>
values of a series of tests run using microbiological challenges made with de-<br>
ionized water.<br><br>

As illustrated in Table II, the filter medium made from lyocell fibers<br>
treated with MERQUAT® 100 and silver provided significant microbiological<br>
interception capabilities as compared to filter medium made from untreated<br><br>
38<br>
lyocell fibers. The efficacy of the microbiological interception enhanced filter<br>
medium when challenged with MS2 viral particles illustrates that a filtration<br>
system of the present invention would prove effective in removing nano-sized<br>
pathogens such as viruses.<br>
Examples 24-27: Microbiological Interception Capability Of The Filter Medium<br>
Made With Treated Lyocell Fibers In the Presence Of Polyanionfc Acids<br>
As discussed above, NOM such as polyanionic acids reduce the<br>
positive zeta potential and, thereby, reduce the efficacy of the microbiological<br>
interception enhanced filter medium. After exposure to 500 ml humic acid<br>
(0.005 g/1.0 L H2O), the zeta potential of the microbiological interception<br>
enhanced filter medium decreased from +14.1 to -14.4. Likewise, after<br>
exposure to 500 ml fulvic acid (0.005 g/1.0 L H2O), the zeta potential of the<br>
microbiological interception enhanced filter medium decreased from +10.1 to<br>
-8.9. Examples 24 to 27 show the reduction in microbiological interception<br>
capabilities of the filter medium made with lyocell fibers treated with<br>
MERQUAT® 100 and silver in the presence of humic and fulvic acid solutions.<br>
Small discs of the filter medium treated with MERQUAT® 100 and<br>
silver were folded and placed in small sterilized glass funnels to form a filter<br>
i and pre-wetted with de-ionized water. Challenge solutions of £ coliand MS2<br>
viral particles were made with humic acid and fulvic acid, respectively.<br>
Approximately 125 ml of the challenge solutions were poured through the<br>
filters and the effluent collected in sterile 250 ml Erlenmeyer flasks. The<br>
effluent was diluted and plated on petri dishes following standard laboratory<br>
i procedures. Log reduction values of E. coli and MS2 viral particles are<br>
summarized in Tables III and IV below.<br><br>

Clearly, the LRVs of the microbiological interception enhanced filter<br>
media in the presence of NOM are significantly lower than the 7 to 9 log<br>
reduction of £ coliand MS2 absent NOM interference as shown in Table II.<br>
Examples 28-46: Microbiological Interception Capability Of The Filter Medium<br>
Made With Treated Lyocell Fibers And An Adsorbent Layer In The Presence Of<br>
Polyanionic Acids<br>
In order to decrease the impact of NOM on the filter medium as shown<br>
in Examples 24 to 27, an adsorbent prefilter was added to the filter to remove<br>
or trap the NOM in the influent prior to contact with the filter medium. The<br>
adsorbent layer is PLEKX® made with 600 g/m2 of finely ground coal-based<br>
activated carbon having a surface area of 1000 m2/g, and is commercially<br>
available from KX Industries, LP.<br>
A composite filter medium combining two (2) layers of a filter medium<br>
made with the microbiological interception enhanced filter medium and one<br>
(1) PLEKX® layer was fitted in ceramic Buchner funnels over a metal drainage<br>
screen. The three (3) layers were secured in each Buchner funnels with a hot<br><br>
40<br>
melt adhesive to prevent any bypass of the influent. A head pressure of water<br>
about 5 cm in depth was maintained in the Buchner funnel at all times. The<br>
filters of examples 28 to 34 were charged with sterile deionized water prior to<br>
the microbiological challenge and were not exposed to either hurnic or fulvic<br>
acids. Results shown in Table V below show that the efficacy of the composite<br>
filter medium with the addition of the adsorbent layer is similar to the results<br>
shown in Table II above.<br>
The filters of examples 35 to 40 were charged with 500 ml of a humic<br>
acid solution (0.005 g/1 L H2O) prior to the microbiological challenge. Results<br>
are shown in Table VI below. The filters of examples 41 to 46 were charged<br>
with 500 ml of a fulvic acid solution (0.005 g/1 L H2O) prior to the<br>
microbiological challenge. Results are shown in Table VII below.<br>

The data shows that the use of an adsorbent prefilter such as PLEKX®,<br>
placed upstream from the microbiological interception enhanced filter<br>
medium, maintained or improved the microbiological interception capabilities<br>
of the filter medium by removing the NOM in the influent before the influent<br>
contacted the microbiological interception enhanced filter medium. The<br>
adsorbent prefilter medium does not need to be treated with the<br>
microbiological interception enhancing agent to maintain the efficacy of the<br>
microbiological interception enhanced filter medium. It may be a cost saving<br>
measure not to treat the adsorbent prefilter medium. Thus, a composite filter<br>
medium including the microbiological interception enhanced filter medium<br>
and an adsorbent layer positioned upstream from the microbiological<br>
interception enhanced filter medium would be robust enough to withstand<br>
interference from NOM.<br>
Examples 47-48: £. co//Challenges Of A Filtration System Of The Present<br>
Invention<br>
Two filtration systems of the present invention, as shown in Fig. 3,<br>
including a composite filter medium comprising two (2) layers of an adsorbent<br>
filter medium, PLEKX® made with 600 g/m2 of coal-based activated carbon<br>
having a surface area of 1000 m3/g, and a single layer of the microbiological<br>
interception enhanced filter medium made from treated fibrillated lyocell<br>
fibers as described in Example 4 were assembled using the clam shell filter<br>
design of Figs. 1 and 2 described above. A supporting layer of PLEKX® was<br><br>
42<br>
placed in the bottom of each filter housing and glued into place using an<br>
ethylene-vinyl acetate (EVA) hot melt The layer -of microbiological<br>
interception enhanced filter medium was glued to the first PLEKX® layer,<br>
followed by a second PLEKX® layer that was also glued into place atop the<br>
microbiological interception enhanced filter medium. This configuration uses<br>
only one of the PLEKX® layers as an adsorbent prefilter, while the other<br>
PLEKX® layer serves primarily as a support for the microbiological interception<br>
enhanced filter medium. The outside edges of the housing were also glued<br>
and pressed firmly together to prevent any bypass leakage to the outside of the<br>
housing. The dimensions of active filter area within the boundary defined by<br>
the hot melt material was between 5 cm to 6 cm wide and 8 cm to 10 cm<br>
long, providing an active filter area of between 40 cm2 and 60 cm2. While hot<br>
melt was used during this prototype testing, filter assembly using ultrasonic or<br>
other welding methods may be applied during commercial production.<br>
A 0.635 cm (0.25 inch) inside diameter hose was attached to the inlet<br>
of the filter housing using a plastic fitting and glued securely into place. The<br>
outlet of the filter was open to allow fluid to exit the filter housing. The hose<br>
attached to the filter inlet was attached to a glass Pyrex funnel to produce a<br>
total inlet water column of approximately 30 cm to 60 cm. Test suspensions<br>
were poured into the funnel to challenge the filter with various organisms.<br>
Approximately 500 ml of de-ionized water was poured through the<br>
filtration system to pre-wet the filter medium inside the housing. For £ coli<br>
testing, a hose and funnel with a combined height of 60 cm was used to<br>
provide head pressure. The flow rate at this influent pressure was 70 ml/min.<br>
A challenge suspension of E. coli was poured through the system and the<br>
effluents collected in sterile 250 ml Erlenmeyer flasks. The effluents were<br>
subjected to serial dilution in duplicate and plated on petri dishes following<br>
standard laboratory procedures and left overnight in 37°C heated incubators.<br><br>
43<br>
The next day all test results were recorded and these are listed in Table VIII<br>
below.<br>

Thus, a filtration system of the present invention utilizing a composite<br>
filter medium including a PLEKX® prefilter and the microbiological<br>
interception enhanced filter medium will provide greater than 8.5 log<br>
reduction of £ coli at a flow rate of approximately 1 to 2 ml/minute»cm2.<br>
Example 49-51: MS2 Challenges Of A Filtration System Of The Present<br>
Invention<br>
Three filters were constructed in a similar fashion as for the £ coli<br>
challenge as described in examples 47 and 48 above, for determining the viral<br>
interception capability of a filtration system of the preserjt invention. In two<br>
filters, Examples 49 and 50, a layer of netting was installed at the bottom,<br>
effluent side, of the filter housing, followed by a layer of the microbiological<br>
interception enhanced filter medium, followed by a single top layer of PLEKX®<br>
made with 600 g/m2 of coal-based activated carbon having a surface area of<br>
1000 mJ/g. For the third filter, Example 51, the plastic netting was replaced<br>
with a metal 100 mesh screen as the bottom support layer. For the MS2<br>
challenge, a hose and funnel of 30 cm was used to reduce the flow rate and<br>
allow for longer contact time through the composite filter medium. De-<br>
ionized water was poured through the system to pre-wet the layers and verify<br><br>
44<br>
that the housing had no leaks. A flow rate of 38 ml/ minute was recorded for<br>
the 30 cm high water column. After the de-ionized water exited through the<br>
system, the MS2 challenge solution was poured through the system. The<br>
effluent was collected in sterile Erlenmeyer flasks, diluted and plated on Petri<br>
dishes following standard procedures for MS2 and left overnight. The next day<br>
all test results were recorded and listed in Table IX below.<br>

A filtration system of the present invention utilizing a composite filter<br>
medium including a PLEKX® prefilter and the microbiological interception<br>
enhanced filter medium is shown to provide greater than 8.5 log reduction of<br>
MS2 at a flow rate of approximately 0.75 ml/minute«cmj.<br>
Examples 52 and 53: Long Term MS2 Challenges Of A Filtration System Of<br>
The Present Invention<br>
These examples assess the effectiveness of a filtration system of the<br>
present invention when challenged with MS2 bacteriphage and having a<br>
composite filter medium including two (2) layers of the microbiological<br>
interception enhanced filter medium and two (2) layers of PLEKX® as described<br>
earlier.<br>
Two filtration systems of the present invention were prepared by<br>
securing a 100 mesh screen inside a filter enclosure as shown in Figs. 1 and 2.<br>
Two layers of the microbiological interception enhanced filter medium were<br><br>
, ' 45<br>
placed atop the mesh screen followed by two layers of PLEKX®. Each layer<br>
was glued securely in place to prevent bypass. The filter enclosure was sealed<br>
with the glue as well. A 0.635 cm (0.25 inch) inner diameter hose was<br>
attached securely to the inlet of the filter housing. The outlet of the filter<br>
housing was open to allow the passage of fluid. A funnel was securely<br>
attached to each filter to provide one with a 25.4 cm (10 inches) water<br>
column, and the other filter with a 10.2 cm (4 inches) water column for testing<br>
of microbiological challenges.<br>
Deionized water, approximately 500 ml, was passed through each<br>
filtration system to pre-wet the filter medium and verify that no bypass was<br>
occurring. Subsequently 500 ml of an MS2 challenge, prepared in deionized<br>
water, was passed through each system. The effluents were collected in sterile<br>
Erlenmeyer flasks, diluted and plated on Petri dishes following standard<br>
procedures for the organism and left overnight. After 24 hours, an additional<br>
500 ml of deionized water was passed through the system followed by another<br>
500 ml MS2 challenge. This protocol was continued every 24 hours until the<br>
filter media no longer provided an LRV above 4. The results are shown in<br>
Tables X and XI below.<br>

The useful life of the filtration system of Example 52 with a pressure<br>
head of 25.4 cm provided an acceptable MS2 log reduction for 6.0 L of water .<br>
for 120 hours. However, when the pressure head was 10.2 cm, as in Example<br>
53, the useful life of the filtration systems was extended, providing acceptable<br>
log reduction values of MS2 for a volume of 13.0 L of water and 364 hours. It<br>
is apparent that the flow rate will affect the microbiological interception<br>
capabilities of the filtration system. From the results of Examples 52 and 53, a<br>
lower flow rate will provide more effective microbiological interception due to<br>
greater contact time of the microorganisms with the filter medium.<br><br>
