				<td>ADAMANTYL ACETAMIDES AS 11 -BETA HYDROXYSTEROID DEHYDROGENASE INHIBITORS<br>
The metabolic syndrome is a disease with increasing prevalence not only in the Western world but also in Asia and developing countries. It is characterised by obesity in particular central or visceral obesity, type 2 diabetes, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, arteriosclerosis, coronary heart diseases and eventually chronic renal failure (C.T. Montague et al. (2000), Diabetes, 49, 883-888).<br>
Glucocorticoids and 1 IpVHSDl are known to be important factors in differentiation of adipose stromal cells into mature adipocytes. In the visceral stromal cells of obese patients, 1 l^-HSDl mRNA level is increased compared with subcutaneous tissue. Further, adipose tissue over-expression of 11P-HSD1 in transgenic mice is associated with increased corticosterone levels in the adipose tissue, visceral obesity, insulin sensitivity, Type 2 diabetes, hyperlipidemia and hyperphagia (H. Masuzaki et al (2001), Science, 294,2166-2170). Therefore, llpVHSDl is most likely be involved in the development of visceral obesity and the metabolic syndrome.<br>
Inhibition of 11P-HSD1 results in a decrease in differentiation and an increase in proliferation of adipose stromal cells. Moreover, glucocorticoid deficiency (adrenalectomy) enhances the ability of insulin and leptin to promote anorexia and weight loss, and this effect is reversed by glucocorticoid administration (P.M. Stewart et al (2002), Trends Endocrin. Metabol, 13, 94-96). These data suggest that enhanced reactivation of cortisone by 1 Ip-HSDl may exacerbate obesity and it may be beneficial to inhibit this enzyme in adipose tissue of obese patients. Obesity is also linked to cardiovascular risks. There is a significant relationship between cortisol excretion rate and HDL cholesterol in both men and women, suggesting that glucocorticoids regulate key components of cardiovascular risk. In analogy, aortic stiffness is also associated with visceral adiposity in older adults.<br>
Glucocorticoids and glaucoma<br>
Glucocorticoids increase the risk of glaucoma by raising the intraocular pressure when administered exogenously and in certain conditions of increased production like in Cushing's syndrome. Corticosteroid-induced elevation of intra ocular pressure is caused by increased resistance to aqueous outflow due to glucocorticoid induced changes in the trabecular meshwork and its intracellular matrix. Zhou et al. (Int J Mol<br><br>
Med (1998) 1, 339-346) also reported that corticosteroids increase the amounts of fibronectin as well as collagen type I and type IV in the trabecular meshwork of organ-cultured bovine anterior segments.<br>
11P-HSD1 is expressed in the basal cells of the corneal epithelium and the non-pigmented epithelial cells. Glucocorticoid receptor mRNA was only detected in the trabecular meshwork, whereas in the non-pigmented epithelial cells mRNA for the glucocorticoid-, mineralocorticoid receptor and 11 P-HSD 1 was present. Carbenoxolone administration to patients resulted in a significant decrease in intra-ocular pressure (S. Rauz et al. (2001), Invest. Ophtalmol. Vis. Science, 42,2037-2042), suggesting a role for HSD1-inhibitors in treating glaucoma.<br>
Accordingly, the underlying problem to be solved by the present invention was to identify potent 11 P-HSD inhibitors, with a high selectivity for 11 P-HSD 1, and the use thereof in treating pathologies associated with excess cortisol formation such as obesity, diabetes, obesity related cardiovascular diseases, and glaucoma.<br>

The amide compounds of this invention can be prepared by any of several standard synthetic processes commonly used by those skilled in the art of organic chemistry and described for instance in; "Introduction to organic chemistry" Streitweiser and Heathcock - Macmillan Publishing Co., Inc. - second edition - New York - Section 24.7 (partA) p 753-756. In general, the amides can be prepared through a base-catalyzed nucleophilic addition between the appropriate carboxylic acid with the corresponding amine (scheme 1), or via a nucleophilic substitution reaction wherein the appropriate amine reacts with either the corresponding acyl halide (scheme 2), anhydride or ester, to yield the required amide.<br>
When coupling the acids to the amines, standard chemical coupling reagents such as carbonyldiimidazole (CDI), 1.3-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide(DCC)or l-ethyl-3-(3'-<br><br>
dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDCI) are used in the presence or absence of hydroxybenzotrialzole (HOBt). In general, adding of the carboxylic acids of formula (III) to the amines of formula (II) under base-catalyzed reaction conditions results in the formation of the amine salt which is in equilibrium with its weak acid and base. To force the equilibrium to the formation of the amide of formula (I), a dehydrogenating agent such as carbodiimides, for example DCC and CDI are added to the reaction mixture. (Formula Remove)<br>
In an alternative embodiment the carboxylic acids or converted into the corresponding acyl halides by reaction with, for example, thionyl chloride or oxalyl chloride. Subsequently said acyl halide (V) is added to the amine of formula (II) to yield the amide of formula (I) using art known reaction procedures such as the Schotten-Baumann method.<br>
(Formula Remove)<br>
The carboxylic acids of formula (HI) and the amines of formula (II) are readily available, or may be prepared using methods that are well known in the art. Many<br>
compounds are commercially available, for example, from Aldrich Chemicals, or when the compounds are not commercially available, they may be readily prepared from available precursors using straightforward transformations that are well known in the art.<br>
For example the carboxylic acids are most often prepared by hydrolysis of nitriles (scheme 3), carbonation of organometallic compounds or oxidation of primary alcohols or aldehydes, see for instance in; "Introduction to organic chemistry" Streitweiser and Heathcock - Macmillan Publishing Co., Inc. - second edition - New York*- Section 19.6 p 509-511. In particular the carboxylic acids of formula (III) are prepared from the corresponding (hetero)aryl acetonitriles (VI) by conversion to the dialkyl or spiroalkyl derivative (VH) using e.g., sodium hexamethyldisilazane and methyl iodide or dibromobutane (see e.g., Trivedi et al, J. Med. Chem. 1993,36, 3300), followed by hydrolysis under acidic or basic conditions to the desired carboxylic acid III. Appropriate acids and bases in the hydrolysis are for example H2SO4 and KOH. The hydrolysis reaction can be conveniently performed using microwave heating. Many of the nitriles of formula (VI) are commercially available, or when they are not available they may be readily prepared from available (hetero)aryl-methyl derivatives (X) under art known conditions, for example by bromination using N-bromo-succinamide (NBS) followed by substitution of bromine by CN using, for example<br>
KCN. (Formula Remove)<br>
In many cases the carboxylic acids wherein Q represents a bromo-substituted aryl (III-A) were further modified according to reaction scheme 4. In a first step the bromo substituent was modified using the Heck reaction with acrylic esters, amides or acrylonitrile to obtain compounds of formula (XII). Reduction of double bond and functional groups yielded substituted amines of formula (XTV). <br>
(Formula Remove)<br>
For those compounds of formula (I) where Q represents carbocyclic radicals containing two rings, the appropriate bicyclic carboxylic acids of formula (III-B) were synthesised, for example, by addition of trimethylsilylcyanide to corresponding ketones (XV) followed by acidic or basic hydrolysis of nitrile compounds (XVT) using standard conditions. Ketones, which were not available, were synthesised by intramolecular cyclisation of corresponding acids (XVHI) (see scheme 5).(Formula Remove) <br>
The amines of formula (II) are generally prepared using art known techniques, see for instance in; "Introduction to organic chemistry" Streitweiser and Heathcock -Macmillan Publishing Co., Inc. - second edition - New York - Section 24.6 p 742-753, and comprise synthesis through indirect alkylation of the appropriate (hetero)aryl halides in particular by the Gabriel synthesis, through reduction of the corresponding nitro or nitrille compounds, through reductive amination using for example the Eschweiler-Clarke reaction and in particular through the reduction of oximes (DQ which may be prepared from aldehydes or ketones (VIS) by reaction with hydroxylamine (scheme 6). In this latter case the oximes are reduced by lithium aluminium hydride or catalytic hydrogenation using an appropriate catalysator such as Raney Nickel, said reduction being performed in an inert anhydrous solvent such as ether or tetrahydrofuran (THF).<br>

Further examples for the synthesis of compounds of formula (I) using anyone of the above mentioned synthesis methods, are provided in the experimental part hereinafter.<br>
Where necessary or desired, any one or more of the following further steps in any order<br>
may be performed:<br>
(i) removing any remaining protecting group(s);<br>
(ii) converting a compound of formula (I) or a protected form thereof into a further<br>
compound of formula (I) or a protected form thereof; (iii) converting a compound of formula (I) or a protected form thereof into a TV-oxide, a<br>
salt, a quaternary amine or a solvate of a compound of formula (I) or a protected<br>
form thereof; (iv) converting a TV-oxide, a salt, a quaternary amine or a solvate of a compound of<br>
formula (I) or a protected form thereof into a compound of formula (I) or a protected<br>
form thereof; (v) converting a TV-oxide, a salt, a quaternary amine or a solvate of a compound of<br>
formula (I) or a protected form thereof into another TV-oxide, a pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable addition salt a quaternary amine or a solvate of a compound of formula<br>
(I) or a protected form thereof; (vi) where the compound of formula (I) is obtained as a mixture of (R) and (S)<br>
enantiomers resolving the mixture to obtain the desired enantiomer; (vii) where the compounds of formula (I) wherein Q consists of bromo-substituted<br>
carbocyclic radicals containing one or two rings, various conversions are possible,<br>
see for example scheme 7 comprising;<br>
a)	alkylation using for example, alkyliodide<br>
b)	conversion to an amine using Buchwald reaction<br>
c)	arylation using Heck-reaction conditions<br>
d)	alkylation using Heck reaction conditions<br>
conversion to nitrile using for example, potassiumcyanide and possible further<br>
conversion of the thus obtained nitrile to an amine that can be alkylated or<br>
acylated under art known conditions. (Figure Remove)<br>
 It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that in the processes described above the functional groups of intermediate compounds may need to be blocked by protecting groups.<br>
Functional groups which it is desirable to protect include hydroxy, amino and carboxylic acid. Suitable protecting groups for hydroxy include trialkylsilyl groups (e.g. tert-butyldimethylsilyl, tert-butyldiphenylsilyl or trimethylsilyl), benzyl and tetrahydropyranyl. Suitable protecting groups for amino include tert-butyloxycarbonyl<br>
or benzyloxycarbonyl. Suitable protecting groups for carboxylic acid include or benzyl esters.<br>
The protection and deprotection of functional groups may take place before or after a reaction step.<br>
The use of protecting groups is fully described in 'Protective Groups in Organic Chemistry', edited by J W F McOmie, Plenum Press (1973), and 'Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis' 2nd edition, T W Greene &amp; P G M Wutz, Wiley Interscience (1991).<br>
Additionally, the N-atoms in compounds of formula (I) can be methylated by art-known methods using CHj-I in a suitable solvent such as, for example 2-propanone, tetrahydrofuran or dimethylformamide.<br>
The compounds of formula (I), can also be converted into each other following art-known procedures of functional group transformation of which some examples are mentioned hereinabove.<br>
The compounds of formula (I), may also be converted to the corresponding JV-oxide forms following art-known procedures for converting a bivalent nitrogen into its TV-oxide form. Said ^/-oxidation reaction may generally be carried out by reacting the starting material of formula (I) with 3-phenyl-2-(phenylsulfonyl)oxaziridine or with an appropriate organic or inorganic peroxide. Appropriate inorganic peroxides comprise, for example, hydrogen peroxide, alkali metal or earth alkaline metal peroxides, e.g. sodium peroxide, potassium peroxide; appropriate organic peroxides may comprise peroxy acids such as, for example, benzenecarboperoxoic acid or halo substituted benzenecarboperoxoic acid, e.g. 3-chlorobenzenecarboperoxoic acid, peroxoalkanoic acids, e.g. peroxoacetic acid, alkylhydroperoxides, e.g. t-butyl hydroperoxide. Suitable solvents are, for example, water, lower alkanols, e.g. ethanol and the like, hydrocarbons., e.g. toluene, ketones, e.g. 2-butanone, halogenated hydrocarbons, e.g. dichloromethane, and mixtures of such solvents.<br>
Pure stereochemically isomeric forms of the compounds of formula (I), may be obtained by the application of art-known procedures. Diastereomers may be separated by physical methods such as selective crystallization and chromatographic techniques, e.g. counter-current distribution, liquid chromatography and the like.<br><br>
Some of the compounds of formula (I), and some of the intermediates in the present invention may contain an asymmetric carbon atom. Pure stereochemically isomeric forms of said compounds and said intermediates can be obtained by the application of art-known procedures. For example, diastereoisomers can be separated by physical methods such as selective crystallization or chromatographic techniques, e.g. counter current distribution, liquid chromatography and the like methods. Enantiomers can be obtained from racemic mixtures by first converting said racemic mixtures with suitable resolving agents such as, for example, chiral acids, to mixtures of diastereomeric salts or compounds; then physically separating said mixtures of diastereomeric salts or compounds by, for example, selective crystallization or chromatographic techniques, e.g. liquid chromatography and the like methods; and finally converting said separated diastereomeric salts or compounds into the corresponding enantiomers. Pure stereochemically isomeric forms may also be obtained from the pure stereochemically isomeric forms of the appropriate intermediates and starring materials, provided that the intervening reactions occur stereospecifically.<br>
An alternative manner of separating the enantiomeric forms of the compounds of formula (I) and intermediates involves Liquid chromatography, in particular liquid chromatography using a chiral stationary phase.<br>
A particular group of enantiomeric intermediates for the compounds of the present invention consist of the syn and anti-isomer l-hydroxy-4-aminoadamantane, an intermediate used in the synthesis of those compounds of formula (I) where R3 represents an optionally substituted 2-adamantyl.<br>
l-hydroxy-4-aminoadamantane is generally prepared by hydroxylation of 2-aminoadamantane, for example, using a mixture of nitric and sulphuric acid (Khimiko Farmatsevticheskii Zhurnal 1986,20, 810; Zhurnal Organichsekoi Khimii 1976,2369).<br>
 (Figure Remove)<br>
The reaction gives two stereomers of l-hydroxy-4-aminoadamantane in ratio 3:1 to 1:1 in favour of syn-isomer. As it was found that the anti-isomers have an improved HSD1 -inhibitory activity, it would be desirable to have a synthesis method that gives a better selectivity in favour of the anti-isomer.<br>
Alternatively l-hydroxy-4-aminoadamantane can be obtained from the corresponding ketone after reductive amination, i.e. the cyclic ketone can be converted to the amine via an imine of oxime formation and consecutive reduction of double binding. The reduction can be done using h'thium aluminium hydride, Raney-nickel or noble metals like palladium, platinum, ruthenium or rhodium supported on carbon. Reductive amination using borohydrides is a one step alternative (well know method described for example in Advanced of organic chemistry from March 2003). The selectivity of the reduction depends on the structure of substrate (ketone) and the used catalyst.<br>
Given the fact that the two isomers of l-hydroxy-4-aminoadamantane obtained after reduction of oxitne or after reductive amination with ammonia are not detectable in LCMC or GCMS, it is very difficult to separate them. The coupling reaction with an acid of formula (III) gives a mixture of two coupling products of formula (I), which are separable using chromatography. However, in order to reduce the synthesis costs and to improve the yield of the anti-isomers it would be desirable to depart from the enatiomeric pure intermediates instead.<br>
It is a object of the present invention to provide a solution for the bove mentioned problem, consisting of a method to prepare l-hydroxy-4-aminoadamantane said method comprising the reductive amination of 5-hydroxy-adamantan-2-one with L(-)-l-phenyl-ethylamine by catalysis using for example ruthenium supported on carbon (Scheme 8). The selectivity afforded was 3:1 in favour of anti-stereomer. The obtained isomers are easy to separate and subsequent debenzylation of anti 4-(l-Phenyl-ethylamino)-adamantan-1-ol gives pure anti-l-hydroxy-4-aminoadamatane.<br>

Some of the intermediates and starting materials as used in the reaction procedures mentioned hereinabove are known compounds and may be commercially available or may be prepared according to art-known procedures.<br>
The compounds of (he present invention are useful because they possess pharmacological properties. They can therefore be used as medicines, in particular to treat pathologies associated with excess cortisol formation such as for example, obesity, diabetes, obesity related cardiovascular diseases, and glaucoma.<br>

The cells preferably used in an assay of the present invention are selected from the group consisting of<br>
mouse fibroblast 3T3-L1 cells, HepG2 cells, pig kidney cell, in particular LCC-PK1 cells and rat hepatocytes.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides the compounds of formula (I), (I'), (I") and their pharmaceutically acceptable JV-oxides, addition salts, quaternary amines and stereochemically isomeric forms for use in therapy. More particular in the treatment or prevention of cell proliferation mediated diseases. The compounds of formula (I), (I'), (I") and their pharmaceutically acceptable JV-oxides, addition salts, quaternary amines and the stereochemically isomeric forms may hereinafter be referred to as compounds according to the invention.<br>
In view of the utility of the compounds according to the invention, there is provided a method for the treatment of an animal, for example, a mammal including humans, suffering from a cell proliferative disorder such as atherosclerosis, restinosis and cancer, which comprises administering an effective amount of a compound according to the present invention.<br>
Said method comprising the systemic or topical administration of an effective amount of a compound according to the invention, to warm-blooded animals, including humans.<br>
It is thus an object of the present invention to provide a compound according to the present invention for use as a medicine. In particular to use the compound according to the present invention in the manufacture of a medicament for treating pathologies associated with excess cortisol formation such as for example, obesity, diabetes, obesity related cardiovascular diseases, and glaucoma.<br>
In yet a further aspect, the present invention provides the use of the compounds according to the invention in the manufacture of a medicament for treating any of the aforementioned cell proliferative disorders or indications.<br>
The amount of a compound according to the present invention, also referred to here as the active ingredient, which is required to achieve a therapeutical effect will be, of course, vary with the particular compound, the route of administration, the age and condition of the recipient, and the particular disorder or disease being treated. A suitable daily dose would be from 0.001 mg/kg to 500 mg/kg body weight, in particular from 0.005 mg/kg to 100 mg/kg body weight. A method of treatment may also include administering the active ingredient on a regimen of between one and four intakes per<br>
day.<br>
While it is possible for the active ingredient to be administered alone, it is preferable to present it as a pharmaceutical composition. Accordingly, the present invention further provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound according to the present invention, together with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent. The carrier or diluent must be "acceptable" in the sense of being compatible with the other ingredients of the composition and not deleterious to the recipients thereof.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions of this invention may be prepared by any methods well known in the art of pharmacy, for example, using methods such as those described in Gennaro et al. Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences (18th ed., Mack Publishing Company, 1990, see especially Part 8 : Pharmaceutical preparations and their Manufacture). A therapeutically effective amount of the particular compound, in base form or addition salt form, as the active ingredient is combined in intimate admixture with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, which may take a wide variety of forms depending on the form of preparation desired for administration. These pharmaceutical compositions are desirably in unitary dosage form suitable, preferably, for systemic administration such as oral, percutaneous, or parenteral administration; or topical administration such as via inhalation, a nose spray, eye drops or via a cream, gel, shampoo or the like. For example, in preparing the compositions in oral dosage form, any of the usual pharmaceutical media may be employed, such as, for example, water, glycols, oils, alcohols and the like in the case of oral liquid preparations such as suspensions, syrups, elixirs and solutions: or solid carriers such as starches, sugars, kaolin, lubricants, binders, disintegrating agents and the like in the case of powders, pills, capsules and tablets. Because of their ease in administration, tablets and capsules represent the most advantageous oral dosage unit form, in which case solid pharmaceutical carriers are obviously employed. For parenteral compositions, the carrier will usually comprise sterile water, at least in large part, though other ingredients, for example, to aid solubility, may be included. Injectable solutions, for example, may be prepared in which the carrier comprises saline solution, glucose solution or a mixture of saline and glucose solution. Injectable suspensions may also be prepared in which case appropriate liquid carriers, suspending agents and the like may be employed. In the compositions suitable for percutaneous administration, the carrier optionally comprises a penetration enhancing agent and/or a suitable wettable agent, optionally combined with suitable additives of any nature in minor proportions, which additives do not cause any significant deleterious effects on the skin. Said additives may facilitate the administration to the skin and/or may be helpful for preparing the desired compositions.<br>
These compositions may be administered in various ways, e.g., as a transdermal patch, as a spot-on or as an ointment. As appropriate compositions for topical application there may be cited all compositions usually employed for topically administering drugs e.g. creams, gellies, dressings, shampoos, tinctures, pastes, ointments, salves, powders and the like. Application of said compositions may be by aerosol, e.g. with a propellant such as nitrogen, carbon dioxide, a fireon, or without a propellant such as a pump spray, drops, lotions, or a semisolid such as a thickened composition which can be applied by a swab. In particular, semisolid compositions such as salves, creams, gellies, ointments and the like will conveniently be used.<br>
It is especially advantageous to formulate the aforementioned pharmaceutical compositions in dosage unit form for ease of administration and uniformity of dosage. Dosage unit form as used in the specification and claims herein refers to physically discrete units suitable as unitary dosages, each unit containing a predetermined quantity of active ingredient calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect in association with the required pharmaceutical carrier. Examples of such dosage unit forms are tablets (including scored or coated tablets), capsules, pills, powder packets, wafers, injectable solutions or suspensions, teaspoonfuls, tablespoonfuls and the like, and segregated multiples thereof.<br>
In order to enhance the solubility and/or the stability of the compounds of formula (I), (F), (F') in pharmaceutical compositions, it can be advantageous to employ a-, (3- or y-cyclodextrins or their derivatives. Also co-solvents such as alcohols may improve the solubility and/or the stability of the compounds of formula (I), (F), (I") in pharmaceutical compositions. In the preparation of aqueous compositions, addition salts of the subject compounds are obviously more suitable due to their increased water solubility.<br>
