				<td>TANDEM WASHING SYSTEM CONFIGURATION FOR<br>
RECYCLING DETERGENT &amp; WATER<br>
Field of Invention:<br>
This invention relates to a detergent and water saving device associated with<br>
automatic washing machine configurations. The invention particularly relates to a<br>
tandem washing system configuration.<br>
Broadly the invention makes use of automatic washing machine technology for<br>
application in domestic, community, commercial and industrial uses such as in homes,<br>
hotels, laundry services, offices and factories etc. The invention by its application<br>
relates to environment pollution technology.<br>
Background of the invention:<br>
In a typical automatic washing machine, there are various cycles for example Pre-<br>
wash. Wash, Rinse and Spin, controlled through a programmable integrated circuit<br>
associated with a variable speed electric motor, solenoid valves and other electro-<br>
mechanical means. In such machines an electric water heater is also provided. These<br>
various cycles may be programmed as per the requirement of the washable load and<br>
availability of resources like water, electricity, time etc. For example, a typical<br>
automatic washing machine may be programmed to wash a predetermined load of<br>
clothes in 30 minutes to 2 hours, and with only one rinse cycle or more, with or<br>
without hot water wash etc. At each wash or rinse cycle the typical washing machine<br>
draws fresh tap water and on completion of the cycle discharges the used water<br>
through a drainage pipe. As a result, there is a heavy use of resources and subsequent<br>
discharge of used water including various quantity of detergents and impurities.<br>
The inventor of the present invention has observed that an effective method for<br>
recycling the discharge water having varying levels of detergents will save costs and<br>
lessen environment pollution.<br>
The prior art devices disclose storage of certain effluents of washing machine<br>
generally known as grey water, which however is restricted to rinse water only<br>
having less detergent. Various means like overhead tanks or reservoirs connected to<br>
the washing machine is used for such storage of grey water. The stored grey water is<br>
then recycled back to the same washing machine for pre-wash or used for flushing<br>
etc. None of these prior art devices is suitable for economic use of resources due to<br>
additional requirement of constructional and plumbing features. In most of these<br>
prior art devices, only rinse water is contemplated for recycling. Moreover, longer<br>
storage of used water may lead to growth of pathogens. There is no saving of<br>
detergent or input energy. On the whole, adverse cost-benefit ratio of the prior art<br>
devices preclude them from large scale application.<br><br>
Object of the invention<br>
It is an object of the invention to provide a tandem washing system configuration<br>
capable of recycling the discharge water containing different levels of detergent.<br>
A further object of the invention is to provide a tandem washing system configuration<br>
comprising at least two automatic washing machines of identical construction being<br>
operably connected and controlled by a single system controller allowing separate<br>
recycling of grey water generated in each cycle.<br>
A still further object of the invention is to provide a tandem washing system<br>
configuration in which the constituent automatic washing machines can be operated at<br>
tandem depending on wash-load, type of washable material, available resources,<br>
thereby optimising the resource consumption.<br>
Yet another objection of the invention is to provide a tandem washing system<br>
configuration in which storage of grey water is eliminated leading to stoppage in<br>
growth of pathogens, thereby acting as an environment friendly washing system.<br>
A still further object of the invention is to provide a tandem washing system<br>
configuration which can be installed and operated without any specialised<br>
infrastructural requirements such as additional water entry/exit source, plumbing<br>
means, energy input point, thereby allowing accommodation of the system in a<br>
smaller space.<br>
Summary of the Invention.<br>
Accordingly there is provided a tandem washing system configuration comprising at<br>
least two automatic washing machines of identical construction disposed parallely or<br>
vertically adjacent to each other being flowably connected via a channel means<br>
having a two-way solenoid valve, each of the two automatic washing machines<br>
having individual tap water inlets separate effluent drainage outlets disposal trays<br>
containing washing chemicals, individual heating devices, separate processors, and<br>
identically designed rotatable means. The system configuration is provided with a<br>
micro-processor-based controller which causes the second automatic washing<br>
machine to use as an input the discharged water of at least one cycle of the first<br>
machine transmitted via the interconnected channel by means of the two-way<br>
solenoid valve. The controller being operable to cause the automatic washing<br>
machines to function at tandem upon selection of any of a plurality of available<br>
attributes in respect of wash cycle, wash load, washable material, intended<br>
consumption of resources, selected time and duration for operation, thereby<br>
optimising the operational inputs and improvement in wash quality.<br>
The first machine is preferably used for less soiled load like garment etc. and the<br>
second machine for heavily soiled like linen, towels, mops, shoes rugs and mats etc.<br>
Discharge of various cycles of the first washing machine is selectable for routing<br>
through the channel means, into the second machine for recycling. Likewise,<br>
discharge of any cycle in both the machines is selectable for routing through the<br><br>
drainage pipes as effluent. Various cycles in both the machines are operable in tandem<br>
to complement each other in an interlocking fashion. Additionally, both machines are<br>
independently operable and /or combinedly.<br>

Detailed Description of a preferred embodiment of the invention.<br>
In Figure 1 there is a twin assembly of Washing Machines assigned with reference<br>
numerals (100 and 200). The machines (100, 200) are connected through a channel<br>
means having a two- way solenoid valve means (300), for channelling water from<br>
one to another. The input to the channel (300) passes through a Sieve and/or Filtration<br>
device (310), to remove suspended impurities like Lint and other large particles.<br>
Additionally, the channel means passes through an Ultraviolet or Gamma rays<br>
irradiation chamber (320) to remove pathogens. The channel is provided with a<br>
back-flush device taking input water from a tap and discharging back-flushed water<br>
into a drainage.<br>
Both the washing machines ( 100, 200) have independent tap water inlets (110, 210 )<br>
and effluent drainage pipes (130, 230).<br>
Both the machines (100, 200) are controlled by a single controller (400) with a pre-<br>
programmed logic and a default setting that can be changed through electronic push<br>
buttons(410) and knobs (420), and is displayed through electronic panels (430, 440)<br><br>
associated with the washing machines (100, 200).<br>
The first washing machine (100) may be used for lesser soiled, e.g. garments and the<br>
second washing machine (200) can be used for heavily soiled e.g. linen, towels, mops,<br>
shoes, doormats etc.<br>
The controller (400) is programmed to operate the two-way solenoid valve means<br>
(300), to direct effluent of each selected cycle of the first-machine (100) as input for<br>
the second machine (200). Additionally, effluent of each cycle of the washing<br>
machines (100, 200) is dischargeable as waste water through the solenoid valve<br>
means (300) directing the flow to the drainage pipes (130 , 230).<br>
The controller (400) is programmed with an interlocking logic, as explained below<br>
through a typical exemplary scenario.<br>
The pre-wash option of the first machine (100) may include extracting fresh water<br>
from the first water inlet (110), drawing stored chemicals from disposal tray (140),<br>
soaking and tumbling the garments in the solution, and channelling the pre-washed<br>
water to the second machine (200) on spinning. The second machine (200) is<br>
programmed to complete its pre-wash cycle, spin and release the re-used pre-washed<br>
water through the drainage (230), while the first machine (100) is completing its<br>
Wash cycle after drawing fresh water through the first water inlet (110). If a hot wash<br>
option has been selected for the first machine (100) e.g. by selecting 'cotton' at knob<br>
(410), the controller (400) causes an inbuilt electrical heater equipped with a<br>
thermostat in the washing machines (100, 200) to control the water temperature at a<br>
desired level. When the first washing machine ( 100) completes its Washing cycle, it<br>
spins and channels hot/cold wash water (with remaining detergent) to the second<br>
washing machine( 200) through the channel (300). The first machine (100) now starts<br>
a Rinse cycle while the second machine (200) starts its Wash cycle. Again if a hot<br>
wash option has been selected for the second machine (200), the temperature of<br>
recycled wash water is maintained at a desired level through the inbuilt heating<br>
device as explained hereinabove. The second machine (200) on completing its Wash<br>
cycle, spins while discharging the reused washed water through the drainage (230),<br>
and stands by for input Rinsed water from the first machine (100). Likewise, at any<br>
stage the first machine (100) may also stand by till the second machine (200) is<br>
through with a cycle and becomes ready to take intended grey water. Then the first<br>
machine(100) spins and channels Rinsed water into the second machine 200. The<br>
second machine(200) then performs the rinse operation by using the recycled water.<br>
Likewise, the first and the second machines (100, 200) repeat the process if a second<br>
rinse has been opted. Finally, the first machine (100) on completing all the selected<br>
cycles, allows its door to open and is ready for the next load. The second<br>
machine(200) may, in the last cycle, draw a specified quantity of fresh tap water for a<br>
final Rinse with or without specified disinfectants stored in a disposal tray(240.). The<br>
second machine (200) then completes the cycles by final spinning of its load, at a<br>
specified RPM. A typical program cycle is shown in Figures 4A and 4B.<br>
Additionally, the second machine (200) may be operated to perform as many fresh<br>
water cycles as desired. For example, there may be a 'double wash' option at<br>
electronic panel (440), if selected will operate the second machine (200) to start a<br>
fresh water wash cycle before the final fresh water rinse in the above example. In this<br><br>
scenario, any of the fresh water cycle discharge may be stored and recycled as<br>
desirable.<br>
The Rinse cycles may consist several short bursts of rinses in which little water is<br>
used, which may be expelled through the drainage pipes (130, 230), while the rinsed<br>
water of full rinse cycles only be channelled into the next machine.<br>
A reservoir chamber may be also provided between the two machines ( 100, 200)for<br>
temporary storage of water of each cycle, operated through a second set of solenoid<br>
valve means connecting it with the machines (100, 200) on both the sides, as shown<br>
in Figures 2A and 2B. In that case, the channel (300) may be placed between the<br>
intermediate reservoir and the second machine (200). In another configuration, the<br>
rilter/sieve (310) is disposed between the first machine (100) and the intermediate<br>
reservoir while the irradiation device (320) may be designed between the intermediate<br>
reservoir and the second machine (200). Both the machines (100, 200), the<br>
intermediate reservoir including the channel are configurable in a vertically stacked<br>
system as shown in Figure 2B.<br>
The filter/sieve (310) may be provided with a known back-flush means. In case of the<br>
intermediate reservoir being provided, the program logic is accordingly set, e.g. the<br>
first machine(100) will hold from releasing grey water selected for recycling if the<br>
intermediate storage is not ready to take it. Additionally, the system may be operable<br>
to store grey water of any particular cycle of any of the machines, for later use in the<br>
starting cycle of any of the machines as desired. If a machine is being used singly, the<br>
grey water so stored for later use may be of any cycle and in that case, if a single<br>
machine is used again, the stored water is also recycled to any cycle as selected in the<br>
controller. For example, if the machines(100, 200) are selected to operate singly, the<br>
wash water of wash cycle of the first machine(100) may be selected for use as<br>
recycled wash water for the next load of the second machine ( 200), or of the first<br>
machine (100) again, by causing the two-way solenoid valves to operate as shown in<br>
Figure 2A.<br>
The cnannel (300) may also be provided with an electronic sensor (330) to check<br>
turbidity of the channelled pre-washed and/or rinsed water of the first machine (100),<br>
and beyond a specified threshold, causes the controller (400) to show a warning signal<br>
and/or halt operations. Alternatively, the controller (400) is programmable to operate<br>
a solenoid valve (340), to release the extra turbid water as effluent, as shown in Figure<br>
3B.. In this scenario, the controller (400) may be further operable to cause the second<br>
machine (200) to extract fresh tap water at (210) for the next cycle. In any of the<br>
cycles, the second machine (200) may also be operable to draw additional detergents<br>
stored in the disposal tray (240).<br>
Additional disinfection means may be provided such as Gamma ray irradiation at the<br>
first machine (100) before the start of first cycle and/or at the second machine (200)<br>
after the last cycle.<br>
Separate motors are provided to run both the machine ( 100, 200) in tandem,<br>
controlled through the common controller (400), incorporated with interdependent<br>
logics such as explained herein above by way of examples.<br><br>
Likewise, there may be other options, with an essential interlock of wash cycles in the<br>
first and the second machine (100) and (200) in such a way that whenever the second<br>
machine (200) is not ready to take intended input of grey water from the first machine<br>
(100), the next cycle of the first machine (100) will remain on hold, and vice-versa i.e.<br>
the second machine (200) will hold the next cycle till the first machine (100) has<br>
performed a corresponding task selected. There may also be an option of switching<br>
off the interlock program. Then both the machines (100, 200) become independent<br>
machines operable separately like conventional washing machines.<br>
In that case the controller (400) may operate both the machines(100, 200)<br>
independently, or two separate conventional controllers of the machines (100,<br>
200)may operate each machine individually.<br>
Figure 4A shows a typical example situation of text displayed at the panels (430, 440)<br>
The Knob (410) preferably has wash type options for (100), e.g. Cotton, Synthetic<br>
etc. Likewise, the knob (420) has options for the second machine(200), like Soiled<br>
(for heavily soiled items like mops, doormats, shoes etc.), Linen etc.<br>
Display panels (430,440) shows typical default setting and maneuverability of<br>
individual cycles in each machine. In the example display panel, 5 cycles in each<br>
machine are selectable as yes/no (y/n) options. Against each of these 5 cycles at the<br>
display panel (430), there is an additional option selections viz. 'Recycle or Not' at<br>
the display panel (430). Similarly, against each of the 5 options at the display panel<br>
(440). Recycled or Fresh water usage is displayed, depending on selections in the<br>
first machine (100). Upon selecting a particular cycle option in one machine, certain<br>
options are automatically selected in the other. For example any selected cycle at the<br>
display panel (430) also selected as Recycle will automatically lead to the<br>
corresponding cycle of the other display panel (440) selected as 'y' and 'Recycled'.<br>
Likewise, if any cycle at the display panel (440) is selected as "Freshwater" the<br>
corresponding previous cycle in the other display panel (430) displays as 'n' against<br>
'Recycle,' and operate the first machine (100) accordingly. As such, various<br>
permutations and combinations are applicable by selecting options at the knobs<br>
(410) ( 420) and at the display panels (430 , 440). A typical chronological sequence<br>
of tandem operation of the two machine cycles corresponding to the default selections<br>
of Figure 4A is shown in Figure 4B.<br>
To simplify the panel options at the display panels ( 430, 440), pre-set combinations<br>
may be selectable through text displays like "Max Cleaning + Low Water Saving' for<br>
example in case of the default setting shown here. However, if all cycles are selected<br>
for Recycle in the example situation, the text display may be "Max Cleaning +<br>
Highest Water Saving". Likewise, if only Wash and one Rinse cycle is selected and<br>
both are also selected for Recycle, the text can be "Min Cleaning + Max Water<br>
Savings. If however, additionally Pre-Wash is also selected, it could be "Medium<br>
cleaning + Max Water Saving" and if yet another Fresh Rinse is selected at the<br>
display panel (440), it could be "Medium Cleaning + Low water Saving" etc. In each<br>
of these selections, further program logic, also known as Fuzzy logic in automated<br>
washing machines, may be applied, such as shortening the length of wash cycle<br>
automatically if the selection is "Min Cleaning + Max Power Saving" etc.<br><br>
The tandem type configurations of the washing system may be preferably horizontal<br>
as shown here, or a vertically stacked twin i.e. the first machine (100) on top of the<br>
second machine (200), to save space or any other desirable reason.<br>
Typical Wash Cycles for both the machines (100, 200) operating in tandem,<br>
controlled through the common controller (408) is shown below for example:<br>
Various advantageous features of the washing machine are the following:<br>
1.	Any cycle of the first machine (100) dischargeable as effluent and rest<br>
recyclable as input for the second machine (200).<br>
2.	Fresh water at any cycle option for the second machine (200) as well, e.g. last<br>
rinse as exemplified above.<br>
3.	Any selected cycle of the first machine(lOO), also being selectable as<br>
'recycle' in the second machine (200).<br>
4.	Independent temperature controls of the machines (100 , 200)<br>
5.	Different Wash logic selectable in the first and second machine(100, 200); e.g.<br>
'delicate' in the first machine 100 and 'hard' in the second machine (200).<br>
6.	Controlling cycles in the machines (100 , 200), depending on selection of<br>
washables types e.g. Cotton in the first machine (100) and heavily Soiled<br>
kitchen mops in the second machine (200).<br>
7.	Interlocked delay operations like starting the machines (100, 200) at a<br>
particular time, or stopping at a particular stage e.g. after pre-washing at the<br>
first machine (100). Additionally, keeping the first machine (100) on 'hold:<br>
till the second machine (200) is not ready to take the intended input of grey<br>
water from the first machine (100).<br>
8.	On finishing the cycles of a particular machine earlier, allowing the door to<br>
open for taking away the cleaned laundry and placing next load to be washed.<br>
9.	After removing the laundered material , grey water is returned from the<br>
machine still in use to the emptied one, for further use in any of the machines<br>
as selected. The 2nd Rinse water may be redirected to the first machine (100)<br>
for temporary storage and subsequent use for the first cycle of the next load in<br>
the second machine (200).<br><br>
10.	Likewise, when only the first machine (100) is used, using the second machine<br>
(200) for storing grey water of any cycle, e.g. either wash or rinse, for later use<br>
in any cycle of the first machine (100).<br>
11.	On switching off the interlock logic, both the machine (100, 200) are operable<br>
independently as two conventional machines.<br><br><br>
12. Interrupted disposal of Detergent, Bleach and other Solvent through disposal<br>
trays (140, 240) in both machines (100, 200); i.e. any of the cycle may be<br>
interrupted to operate the machine to extract specified material stocked in the<br>
disposal tray ( 140, 240).<br>
The multiple combination may have one or more of any type of automatic washing<br>
machine such as front loading tumble or top loading agitator etc. For example the first<br>
machine may be front loading tumble wash suitable for delicate clothes and the<br>
second may be top loading agitator wash more suitable for heavily soiled linen etc.<br>
The tandem type washing system may be placed on the roof-top for further recycling<br>
of effluent waters of the first machine (100) and/or the second machine (200)<br>
discharged through their associated drainage pipes( 130, 230) . In this configuration,<br>
the said drainage pipes (130, 230) are connected to a storage device such as a<br>
reservoir (500). The reservoir may pass the effluent water through a Channel means<br>
that may be similar to the channel means (300), shown here at (505). The channel<br>
means (505) may lead to a storage tank (510) that may have filtration means such as<br>
divider plates with descending level of pores or no-porous plates placed in such a way<br>
that it allows overflow to the next chamber. Additionally, the storage tanks may have<br>
transparent panels that allow solar rays to pass through in the stored water, for<br>
prevention of and further breakdown of pathogens. A solar heater may also be<br>
employed if the water is desired to be heated.<br>
The biggest advantage of this novel construction is that the effluent grey water<br>
discharged and stored at the roof top does not require any pumping. As the fresh water<br>
used for washing is generally already stored at the rooftops, there is net saving of<br>
energy. The grey water may be further processed using sun-rays and may be supplied<br>
through a separate pipelines for flushing (520), gardening (530), car-wash (540) and<br>
the like. Moreover, laundering at roof top will also facilitate drying clothes under the<br>
sun, further saving efforts to carry the washed clothes there. An additional drainage<br>
pipe running through the bottom of all compartments (550) may be connected to a<br>
hydrant (560) for any use including for ground water recharging through a pit (570),<br>
additional water source in emergencies like fire as shown (580).<br>
In a different scenario, more than two machines may be interconnected serially, e.g. a<br>
third machine operable to extract selected effluents of the second and/or first machine,<br>
and so on. This type of modular configuration may be more useful in an industrial<br>
situation where heavily soiled load maybe more.<br>
Many known devices and processed may be used to clean the final effluents of the<br>
tandem washing machines placed at the rooftops. Through additional mechanical<br>
means, alternative drainage and fool-proofing systems may be provided for<br>
contingencies like power-failure, system crash and/or overflow etc.<br>
Although the present invention has been described in detail here, various changes,<br>
substitutions, and alterations may be readily ascertainable by those skilled in the art<br>
and may be made herein without departing from the spirit and scope of the present<br>
invention as defined in the following claims. Moreover, the present invention is not<br>
intended to be limited in any way by any statement in the specification that is not<br>
otherwise reflected in the appended claims.<br><br><br>
