IMPLANTS AND RELATED METHODS<br>
By<br>
Patrick Hughes<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
The present invention generally relates to devices and methods to treat an<br>
eye of a patient, and more specifically to intraocular implants that provide extended<br>
release of a therapeutic agent to an eye in which the implant is placed to treat ocular<br>
hypertension, such as by reducing or at least maintaining intraocular pressure, and<br>
to methods of making and using such implants.<br>
Ocular hypotensive agents are useful in the treatment of a number of various<br>
ocular hypertensive conditions, such as post-surgical and post-laser trabeculectomy<br>
ocular hypertensive episodes, glaucoma, and as presurgical adjuncts.<br>
Glaucoma is a disease of the eye characterized by increased intraocular<br>
pressure. On the basis of its etiology, glaucoma has been classified as primary or<br>
secondary. For example, primary glaucoma in adults (congenital glaucoma) may be<br>
either open-angle or acute or chronic angle-closure. Secondary glaucoma results<br>
from pre-existing ocular diseases such as uveitis, intraocular tumor or an enlarged<br>
cataract.<br>
The underlying causes of primary glaucoma are not yet known. The<br>
increased intraocular tension is due to the obstruction of aqueous humor outflow. In<br>
chronic open-angle glaucoma, the anterior chamber and its anatomic structures<br>
appear normal, but drainage of the aqueous humor is impeded. In acute or chronic<br>
angle-closure glaucoma, the anterior chamber is shallow, the filtration angle is<br>
narrowed, and the iris may obstruct the trabecular meshwork at the entrance of the<br>
canal of Schlemm. Dilation of the pupil may push the root of the iris forward against<br>
the angle, and may produce pupillary block and thus precipitate an acute attack.<br>
Eyes with narrow anterior chamber-angles are predisposed to acute angle-closure<br>
glaucoma attacks of various degrees of severity.<br>
Secondary glaucoma is caused by any interference with the flow of aqueous<br>
humor from the posterior chamber into the anterior chamber and subsequently, into<br>
the canal of Schlemm. Inflammatory disease of the anterior segment may prevent<br>
aqueous escape by causing complete posterior synechia in iris bombe and may plug<br>
the drainage channel with exudates. Other common causes are intraocular tumors,<br>
enlarged cataracts, central retinal vein occlusion, trauma to the eye, operative<br>
procedures and intraocular hemorrhage.<br>
Considering all types together, glaucoma occurs in about 2% of all persons<br>
over the age of 40 and may be asymptotic for years before progressing to rapid loss<br>
of vision. In cases where surgery is not indicated, topical beta-adrenoreceptor<br>
antagonists have traditionally been the drugs of choice for treating glaucoma.<br>
Prostaglandins were earlier regarded as potent ocular hypertensives;<br>
however, evidence accumulated in the last two decades shows that some<br>
prostaglandins are highly effective ocular hypotensive agents and are ideally suited<br>
for the long-term medical management of glaucoma. (See, for example, Starr, M. S.<br>
Exp. Eye Res. 1971, 11, pp. 170-177; Bito, L Z. Biological Protection with<br>
Prostaglandins Cohen, M. M., ed., Boca Raton, Fla., CRC Press Inc., 1985, pp. 231-<br>
252; and Bito, L. Z., Applied Pharmacology in the Medical Treatment of Glaucomas<br>
Drance, S. M. and Neufeld, A. H. eds., New York, Grune &amp; Stratton, 1984, pp. 477-<br>
505). Such prostaglandins include PGF2a, PGF1a, PGE2, and certain lipid-soluble<br>
esters, such as Ct to C5 alkyl esters, e.g. 1-isopropyl ester, of such compounds.<br>
In U.S. Pat. No. 4,599,353 certain prostaglandins, in particular PGE2 and<br>
PGF2a and the C-i to C5 alkyl esters of the latter compound, were reported to<br>
possess ocular hypotensive activity and were recommended for use in glaucoma<br>
management<br>
Although the precise mechanism is not yet known, recent experimental<br>
results indicate that the prostaglandin-induced reduction in intraocular pressure<br>
results from increased uveoscleral outflow [Nilsson et al., Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis.<br>
Sci. 28(suppl), 284(1987)].<br>
The isopropyl ester of PGF2a has been shown to have significantly greater<br>
hypotensive potency than the parent compound, which was attributed to its more<br>
effective penetration through the cornea. In 1987, this compound was described as<br>
"the most potent ocular hypotensive agent ever reported." [See, for example, Bito, L,<br>
Z., Arch. Ophthalmol. 105,1036 (1987), and Siebold et al., Prodrug 5, 3 (1989)].<br>
Whereas prostaglandins appear to be devoid of significant intraocular side<br>
effects, ocular surface (conjunctiva!) hyperemia and foreign-body sensation have<br>
been consistently associated with the topical ocular use of such compounds, in<br>
particular PGF2a and its prodrugs, e.g. its 1-isopropyl ester, in humans. The clinical<br>
potential of prostaglandins in the management of conditions associated with<br>
increased ocular pressure, e.g. glaucoma, is greatly limited by these side effects.<br>
Certain prostaglandins and their analogs and derivatives, such as the PGF2a<br>
derivative latanoprost, sold under the trademark Xalatan®, have been established as<br>
compounds useful in treating ocular hypertension and glaucoma. However,<br>
latanoprost, the first prostaglandin approved by the United States Food And Drug<br>
Administration for this indication, is a prostaglandin derivative possessing the<br>
undesirable side effect of producing an increase in brown pigment in the iris of 5-<br>
15% of human eyes. The change in color results from an increased number of<br>
melanosomes (pigment granules) within iridial melanocytes. See e.g., Watson et al.,<br>
Ophthalmology 103:126 (1996). While it is still unclear whether this effect has<br>
additional and deleterious clinical ramifications, from a cosmetic standpoint alone<br>
such side effects are undesirable.<br>
Certain phenyl and phenoxy mono, tri and tetra nor prostaglandins and their<br>
1-esters are disclosed in European Patent Application 0,364,417 as useful in the<br>
treatment of glaucoma or ocular hypertension.<br>
In a series of United States patent applications assigned to Allergan, Inc.<br>
prostaglandin esters with increased ocular hypotensive activity accompanied with no<br>
or substantially reduced side-effects are disclosed. U.S. Pat. application Ser. No.<br>
(USSN) 386,835 (filed Jul. 27,1989), relates to certain 11-acyl-prostaglandins, such<br>
as 11 -pivaloyl, 11 -acetyl, 11 -isobutyryl, 11 -valeryl, and 11 -isovaleryl PGF2a.<br>
Intraocular pressure reducing 15-acyl prostaglandins are disclosed in U.S. Ser. No.<br>
357,394 (filed May 25, 1989). Similarly, 11,15-9,15- and 9,11-diesters of<br>
prostaglandins, for example 11,15-dipivaloyl PGF2a are known to have ocular<br>
hypotensive activity. See U.S. Ser. No. 385,645 filed Jul. 27, 1990, now U.S. Pat.<br>
No. 4,494,274; 584,370 which is a continuation of U.S. Ser. No. 386,312, and U.S.<br>
Ser. No. 585,284, now U.S. Pat. No. 5,034,413 which is a continuation of U.S. Ser.<br>
No. 386,834, where the parent applications were filed on Jul. 27, 1989.<br>
Woodward et al U.S. Pat. No. 5,688,819 and 6,403,649 disclose certain<br>
cyclopentane heptanoic acid, 2-cycloalkyl or arylalkyl compounds as ocular<br>
hypotensives. These compounds, which can properly be characterized as<br>
hypotensive lipids, are effective in treating ocular hypertension.<br>
As one example, the prostamide analog, bimatoprost, has been discovered to<br>
be effective in reducing intraocular pressure possibly by increasing the aqueous<br>
humour outflow of an eye (Woodward et al., AGN 192024 (Lumigan®): A Synthetic<br>
Prostamide Analog that Lowers Primate Intraocular Pressure by Virtue of Its<br>
Inherent Pharmacological Activity, ARVO 2002; (CD-ROM):POS; Chen et al.,<br>

(2001); and Woodward et al., The Pharmacology of Bimatoprost (Lumigan™), Surv<br>
Ophthalmol 45 (Suppl 4) S337-S345 (2001).<br>
Bimatoprost is an analog (e.g., a structural derivative) of a naturally occurring<br>
prostamide. Bimatoprost's chemical name is (Z)-7-[(1 R,2R,3R,5S)-3,5-Dihydroxy-2-<br>
[1 E,3S)-3-hydroxy-5-phenyl-1 -pentenyl]cyclopentyl]-5-N-ethylheptenamide, and it<br>
has a molecular weight of 415.58. It's molecular formula is C25H37NO4. Bimatoprost<br>
is available in a topical ophthalmic solution under the tradename Lumigan®<br>
(Allergan, Inc.). Each mL of the solution contains 0.3 mg of bimatoprost as the<br>
active agent, 0.05 mg of benzalkonium chloride (BAK) as a preservative, and sodium<br>
chloride, sodium phosphate, dibasic; citric acid; and purified water as inactive<br>
agents.<br>
Biocompatible implants for placement in the eye have been disclosed in a<br>
number of patents, such as U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,521,210; 4,853,224; 4,997,652;<br>
5,164,188; 5,443,505; 5,501,856; 5,766,242; 5,824,072; 5,869,079; 6,074,661;<br>
6,331,313; 6,369,116; and 6,699,493.<br>
It would be advantageous to provide eye implantable drug delivery systems,<br>
such as intraocular implants, and methods of using such systems, that are capable<br>
of releasing a therapeutic agent, such as a hypotensive agent, at a sustained or<br>
controlled rate for extended periods of time and in amounts with few or no negative<br>
side effects.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
The present invention provides new drug delivery systems, and methods of<br>
making and using such systems, for extended or sustained drug release into an eye,<br>
for example, to achieve one or more desired therapeutic effects. The drug delivery<br>
systems are in the form of implants or implant elements that may be placed in an<br>
eye. The present systems and methods advantageously provide for extended<br>
release times of one or more therapeutic agents. Thus, the patient in whose eye the<br>
implant has been placed receives a therapeutic amount of an agent for a long or<br>
extended time period without requiring additional administrations of the agent. For<br>
example, the patient has a substantially consistent level of therapeutically active<br>
agent available for consistent treatment of the eye over a relatively long period of<br>
time, for example, on the order of at least about one week, such as between about<br>
two and about six months after receiving an implant. Such extended release times<br>
facilitate obtaining successful treatment results.<br>
Intraocular implants in accordance with the disclosure herein comprise a<br>
therapeutic component and a drug release sustaining component associated with<br>
the therapeutic component. In accordance with the present invention, the<br>
therapeutic component comprises, consists essentially of, or consists of, a<br>
prostamide component, such as a prostamide derivative that is effective in reducing<br>
or maintaining a reduced intraocular pressure in a hypertensive eye. The drug<br>
release sustaining component is associated with the therapeutic component to<br>
sustain release of an amount of the prostamide component into an eye in which the<br>
implant is placed. The amount of the prostamide component is released into the eye<br>
for a period of time greater than about one week after the implant is placed in the<br>
eye and is effective in treating or reducing at least one symptom of an ocular<br>
condition of an eye. Advantageously, the present intraocular implants may be<br>
effective in relieving a hypertensive eye by reducing the intraocular pressure of the<br>
eye or maintaining the intraocular pressure at a reduced level.<br>
In one embodiment, the intraocular implants comprise prostamide component<br>
and a biodegradable polymer matrix. The prostamide component is associated with<br>
a biodegradable polymer matrix that releases drug at a rate effective to sustain<br>
release of an amount of the prostamide component from the implant effective to treat<br>
an ocular condition. The intraocular implant is biodegradable or bioerodible and<br>
provides a sustained release of the prostamide component in an eye for extended<br>
periods of time, such as for more than one week, for example for about three months<br>
or more and up to about six months or more.<br>
The biodegradable polymer component of the foregoing implants may be a<br>
mixture of biodegradable polymers, wherein at least one of the biodegradable<br>
polymers is a polylactic acid polymer having a molecular weight less than 64<br>
kiloDaltons (kD). Additionally or alternatively, the foregoing implants may comprise<br>
a first biodegradable polymer of a polylactic acid, and a different second<br>
biodegradable polymer of a polylactic acid. Furthermore, the foregoing implants<br>
may comprise a mixture of different biodegradable polymers, each biodegradable<br>
polymer having an inherent viscosity in a range of about 0.2 deciliters/gram (dl/g) to<br>
about 1.0 dl/g.<br>
The prostamide component of the implants disclosed herein may include<br>
prostamide derivatives, such'as a prostamide analog, that are effective in treating<br>
ocular conditions. One example of a suitable prostamide derivative is bimatoprost or<br>
a salt thereof. In addition, the therapeutic component of the present implants may<br>
include one or more additional and different therapeutic agents that may be effective<br>
in treating an ocular condition.<br>
•A method of making the present implants involves combining or mixing the<br>
prostamide component with a biodegradable polymer or polymers. The mixture may<br>
then be extruded or compressed to form a single composition. The single<br>
composition may then be processed to form individual implants suitable for<br>
placement in an eye of a patient.<br>
The implants may be placed in an ocular region to treat a variety of ocular<br>
conditions. For example, the implants may be effective in reducing ocular<br>
hypertension, and thereby, may be .effective in reducing at least one symptom of an<br>
ocular condition associated with an increased intraocular pressure.<br>
Kits in accordance with the present invention may comprise one or more of<br>
the present implants, and instructions for using the implants. For example, the<br>
instructions may explain how to administer the implants to a patient, and types of<br>
conditions that may be treated with the implants.<br>
Each and every feature described herein, and each and every combination of<br>
two or more of such features, is included within the scope of'the present invention<br>
provided that the features included in such a combination are not mutually<br>
inconsistent. In addition, any feature or combination of features may be specifically<br>
excluded from any embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Additional aspects and advantages of the present invention are set forth in<br>
the following description and claims, particularly when considered in conjunction with<br>
the accompanying drawings.<br>
DESCRIPTION<br>
As described herein, controlled and sustained administration of a therapeutic<br>
agent through the use of one or more intraocular implants may improve treatment of<br>
undesirable ocular conditions. The implants comprise a pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable polymeric composition and are formulated to release one or more<br>
pharmaceutically active agents, such as a prostamide, a prostamide derivative, such<br>
as a prostamide analog, or other intraocular pressure lowering agent, over an<br>
extended period of time. The implants are effective to provide a therapeutically<br>
effective dosage of the agent or agents directly to a region of the eye to treat or<br>
prevent one or more undesirable ocular conditions. Thus, with a single<br>
administration, therapeutic agents will be made available at the site where they are<br>
needed and will be maintained for an extended period of time, rather than subjecting<br>
the patient to repeated injections OF repeated administration of topical drops.<br>
An intraocular implant in accordance with the disclosure herein comprises a<br>
therapeutic component and a drug release sustaining component associated with<br>
the therapeutic component. In accordance with the present invention, the<br>
therapeutic component comprises, consists essentially of, or consists of, a<br>
prostamide component. The drug release sustaining component is associated with<br>
the therapeutic component to sustain release of an effective amount of the<br>
prostamide component into an eye in which the implant is placed. The amount of<br>
the prostamide component is released into the eye for a period of time greater than<br>
about one week after the implant is placed in the eye, and is effective in treating or<br>
reducing a symptom of an ocular condition.<br>
Definitions<br>
For the purposes of this description, we use the following terms as defined in<br>
this section, unless the context of the word indicates a different meaning.<br>
As used herein, an "intraocular implant" refers to a device or element that is<br>
structured, sized, or otherwise configured to be placed in an eye. Intraocular<br>
implants are generally biocompatible with physiological conditions of an eye and do<br>
not cause adverse side effects. Intraocular implants may be placed in an eye<br>
without disrupting vision of the eye.<br>
As used herein, a "therapeutic component" refers to a portion of an<br>
intraocular implant comprising one or more therapeutic agents or substances used<br>
to treat a medical condition of the eye. The therapeutic component may be a<br>
discrete region of an intraocular implant, or it may be homogenously distributed<br>
throughout the implant. The therapeutic agents of the therapeutic component are<br>
typically ophthalmically acceptable, and are provided in a form that does not cause<br>
adverse reactions when the implant is placed in an eye.<br>
As used herein, a "prostamide component" refers to a portion of an<br>
intraocular implant that comprises one or more prostamides, one or more<br>
prostamide derivatives, such as a prostamide analog, salts thereof, and mixtures<br>
thereof. A prostamide derivative is a compound that contains the essential elements<br>
of the prostamide from which it is derived in order to provide a therapeutic effect. A<br>
prostamide derivative includes prostamide analogs, and can be identified using any<br>
conventional methods known by persons of ordinary skill in the art used to evaluate<br>
the efficacy of a prostamide. For example, therapeutically effective prostamide<br>
derivatives can be identified by applying the prostamide derivative to an eye with<br>
increased intraocular pressure, and evaluating whether the intraocular pressure<br>
decreases after the application. A prostamide component may also include one or<br>
more prostaglandin analogs.<br>
As used herein, a "drug release sustaining component" refers to a portion of<br>
the intraocular implant that is effective to provide a sustained release of the<br>
therapeutic agents of the implant. A drug release sustaining component may be a<br>
biodegradable polymer matrix, or it may be a coating covering a core region of the<br>
implant that comprises a therapeutic component.<br>
As used herein, "associated with" means mixed with, dispersed within,<br>
coupled to, covering, or surrounding.<br>
As used herein, an "ocular region" or "ocular site" refers generally to any area<br>
of the eyeball, including the anterior and posterior segment of the eye, and which<br>
generally includes, but is not limited to, any functional (e.g., for vision) or structural<br>
tissues found in the eyeball, or tissues or cellular layers that partly or completely line<br>
the interior or exterior of the eyeball. Specific examples of areas of the eyeball in an<br>
ocular region include the anterior chamber, the posterior chamber, the vitreous<br>
cavity, the choroid, the suprachoroidal space, the conjunctiva, the subconjunctival<br>
space, the episcleral space, the intracorneal space, the epicorneal space, the sclera,<br>
the pars plana, surgically-induced avascular regions, the macula, and the retina.<br>
As used herein, an "ocular condition" is a disease, ailment or condition which<br>
affects or involves the eye or one of the parts or regions of the eye. Broadly<br>
speaking the eye includes the eyeball and the tissues and fluids which constitute the<br>
eyeball, the periocular muscles (such as the oblique and rectus muscles) and the<br>
portion of the optic nerve which is within or adjacent to the eyeball.<br>
An anterior ocular condition is a disease, ailment or condition which affects or<br>
which involves an anterior (i.e. front of the eye) ocular region or site, such as a<br>
periocular muscle, an eye lid or an eye ball tissue or fluid which is located anterior to<br>
the posterior wall of the lens capsule or ciliary muscles. Thus, an anterior ocular<br>
condition primarily affects or involves the conjunctiva, the cornea, the anterior<br>
chamber, the iris, the posterior chamber (behind the retina but in front of the<br>
posterior wall of the lens capsule), the lens or the lens capsule and blood vessels<br>
and nerve which vascularize or innervate an anterior ocular region or site.<br>
Thus, an anterior ocular condition can include a disease, ailment or condition,<br>
such as for example, aphakia; pseudophakia; astigmatism; blepharospasm; cataract;<br>
conjunctival diseases; conjunctivitis; corneal diseases;, corneal ulcer; dry eye<br>
syndromes; eyelid diseases; lacrimal apparatus diseases; lacrimal duct obstruction;<br>
myopia; presbyopia; pupil disorders; refractive disorders and strabismus. Glaucoma<br>
can also be considered to be an anterior ocular condition because a clinical goal of<br>
glaucoma treatment can be to reduce a hypertension of aqueous fluid in the anterior<br>
chamber of the eye (i.e. reduce intraocular pressure).<br>
A posterior ocular condition is a disease, ailment or condition which primarily<br>
affects or involves a posterior ocular region or site such as choroid or sclera (in a<br>
position posterior to a plane through the posterior wall of the lens capsule), vitreous,<br>
vitreous chamber, retina, optic nerve (i.e. the optic disc), and blood vessels and<br>
nerves which vascularize or innervate a posterior ocular region or site.<br>
Thus, a posterior ocular condition can include a disease, ailment or condition,<br>
such as for example, acute macular neuroretinopathy; Behcet's disease; choroidal<br>
neovascularization; diabetic uveitis; histoplasmosis; infections, such as fungal or<br>
viral-caused infections; macular degeneration, such as acute macular degeneration,<br>
non-exudative age related macular degeneration and exudative age related macular<br>
degeneration; edema, such as macular edema, cystoid macular edema and diabetic<br>
macular edema; multifocal choroiditis; ocular trauma which affects a posterior ocular<br>
site or location; ocular tumors; retinal disorders, such as central retinal vein<br>
occlusion, diabetic retinopathy (including proliferative diabetic retinopathy),<br>
proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR), retinal arterial occlusive disease, retinal<br>
detachment, uveitic retinal disease; sympathetic opthalmia; Vogt Koyanagi-Harada<br>
(VKH) syndrome; uveal diffusion; a posterior ocular condition caused by or<br>
influenced by an ocular laser treatment; posterior ocular conditions caused by or<br>
influenced by a photodynamic therapy, photocoagulation, radiation retinopathy,<br>
epiretinal membrane disorders, branch retinal vein occlusion, anterior ischemic optic<br>
neuropathy, non-retinopathy diabetic retinal dysfunction, retinitis pigmentosa, and<br>
glaucoma. Glaucoma can bd considered a posterior ocular condition because the<br>
therapeutic goal is to prevent the loss of or reduce the occurrence of loss of vision<br>
due to damage to or loss of retinal cells or optic nerve cells (i.e. neuroprotection).<br>
The term "biodegradable polymer" refers to a polymer or polymers which<br>
degrade in vivo, and wherein erosion of the polymer or polymers over time occurs<br>
concurrent with or subsequent to release of the therapeutic agent. Specifically,<br>
hydrogels such as methylcellulose which act to release drug through polymer<br>
swelling are specifically excluded from the term "biodegradable polymer". The terms<br>
"biodegradable" and "bioerodible" are equivalent and are used interchangeably<br>
herein. A biodegradable polymer may be a homopolymer, a copolymer, or a<br>
polymer comprising more than two different polymeric units.<br>
The term "treat", "treating", or "treatment" as used herein, refers to reduction<br>
or resolution or prevention of an ocular condition, ocular injury or damage, or to<br>
promote healing of injured or damaged ocular tissue. A treatment is usually effective<br>
to reduce at least one symptom of an ocular condition, ocular injury or damage.<br>
The term "therapeutically effective amount" as used herein, refers to the level<br>
or amount of agent needed to treat an ocular condition, or reduce or prevent ocular<br>
injury or damage without causing significant negative or adverse side effects to the<br>
eye or a region of the eye. In view of the above, a therapeutically effective amount<br>
of a therapeutic agent, such as a prostamide or prostamide derivative, is an amount<br>
that is effective in reducing at least one symptom of an ocular condition.<br>
Intraocular implants have been developed which can release drug loads over<br>
various time periods. These implants, which when inserted into an eye, such as the<br>
vitreous of an eye, provide therapeutic levels of a prostamide component for<br>
extended periods of time (e.g., for about 1 week or more). The disclosed implants<br>
are effective in treating ocular conditions, such as ocular conditions associated with<br>
elevated intraocular pressure, and more specifically in reducing at least one<br>
symptom of glaucoma.<br>
In one embodiment of the present invention, an intraocular implant comprises<br>
a biodegradable polymer matrix. The biodegradable polymer matrix is one type of a<br>
drug release sustaining component. The biodegradable polymer matrix is effective<br>
in forming a biodegradable intraocular implant. The biodegradable intraocular<br>
implant comprises a prostamide component associated with the biodegradable<br>
polymer matrix. The matrix degrades at a rate effective to sustain release of an<br>
amount of the prostamide component for a time greater than about one week from<br>
the time in which the implant is placed in ocular region or ocular site, such as the<br>
vitreous of an eye.<br>
The prostamide component-of the implant includes one or more types of<br>
prostamides, prostamide derivatives, salts thereof, and mixtures thereof. In certain<br>
implants, the prostamide component comprises a compound having the formula (I)<br>
wherein the dashed bonds represent a single or double bond which can be in the cis<br>
or trans configuration, A is an alkylene or alkenylene radical having from two to six<br>
carbon atoms, which radical may be interrupted by one or more oxide radicals and<br>
substituted with one or more hydroxy, oxo, alkyloxy or akylcarboxy groups wherein<br>
said alkyl radical comprises from one to six carbon atoms; B is a cycloalkyl radical<br>
having from three to seven carbon atoms, or an aryl radical, selected from the group<br>
consisting of hydrocarbyl aryl and heteroaryl radicals having from four to ten carbon<br>
atoms wherein the heteroatom is selected from the group consisting of nitrogen,<br>
oxygen and sulfur atoms; X is a radical selected from the group consisting of --OR4<br>
and -N(R4)2 wherein R4 is selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, a lower<br>
alkyl radical having from one to six carbon atoms,<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
wherein R5 is a lower alkyl radical having from one to six carbon atoms; Z is<br>
=O or represents 2 hydrogen radicals; one of RI and R2 is =O, -OH or a -O(CO)R6<br>
group, and the other one is -OH or -O(CO)R6, or R1 is =O and R2 is H, wherein R6 is<br>
a saturated or unsaturated acyclic hydrocarbon group having from 1 to about 20<br>
carbon atoms, or -(Ch^mR/ wherein m is 0 or an integer of from 1 to 10, and R7 is<br>
cycloalkyl radical, having from three to seven carbon atoms, or a hydrocarbyl aryl or<br>
heteroaryl radical, as defined above, or a pharmaceutically-acceptable salt thereof,<br>
provided, however, that when B is not substituted with a pendant heteroatomcontaining<br>
radical, and Z is =0, then X is not -OR4.<br>
Pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts of the compounds of the<br>
invention are those formed from acids which form non-toxic addition salts containing<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable anions, such as the hydrochloride, hydrobromide,<br>
hydroiodide, sulfate, or bisulfate, phosphate or acid phosphate, acetate, maleate,<br>
fumarate, oxalate, lactate, tartrate, citrate, gluconate, saccharate and p-toluene<br>
sulphonate salts.<br>
In more specific implants, the compound of the prostamide component has<br>
the following formula (II)<br>
wherein y is 0 or 1, x is 0 or 1 and x+y are not both 1, Y is a radical selected<br>
from the group consisting of alkyl, halo, nitro, amino, thiol, hydroxy, alkyloxy,<br>
alkylcarboxy and halo substituted alkyl, wherein said alkyl radical comprises from<br>
one to six carbon atoms, n is 0 or an integer of from 1 to 3 and R3 is =0, -OH or<br>
O(CO)R6.<br>
In additional implants, the compound of the prostamide component has the<br>
following formula (III)<br>
wherein hatched lines indicate the a configuration and solid triangles indicate<br>
the p configuration.<br>
In certain implants, the compound of the prostamide component has the<br>
following formula (IV)<br>
wherein Y1 is Cl or trifluoromethyl, such as the compound having the following<br>
formula (V)<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
and the 9-and/or 11 - and/or 15 esters thereof.<br>
In at least one type of intraocular implant, the prostamide component<br>
comprises a compound having the following formula (VI)<br>
The compound having the formula VI is also known as bimatoprost and is<br>
publicly available in a topical ophthalmic solution under the tradename, Lumigan®<br>
(Allergan, Inc., CA).<br>
Thus, the implant may comprise a therapeutic component which comprises,<br>
consists essentially of, or consists of bimatoprost, a salt thereof, or mixtures thereof.<br>
The prostamide component may be in a particulate or powder form and it may<br>
be entrapped by the biodegradable polymer matrix. Usually, prostamide particles<br>
will have an effective average size less than about 3000 nanometers. In certain<br>
implants, the particles may have an effective average particle size about an order of<br>
magnitude smaller than 3000 nanometers. For example, the particles may have an<br>
effective average particle size of less than about 500 nanometers. In additional<br>
implants, the particles may have an effective average particle size of less than about<br>
400 nanometers, and in still further embodiments, a size less than about 200<br>
nanometers.<br>
The prostamide component of the implant is preferably from about 10% to<br>
90% by weight of the implant. More preferably, the prostamide component is from<br>
about 20% to about 80% by weight of the implant. In a preferred embodiment, the<br>
prostamide component comprises about 20% by weight of the implant (e.g., 15%-<br>
25%). In another embodiment, the prostamide component comprises about 50% by<br>
weight of the implant.<br>
Suitable polymeric materials or compositions for use in the implant include<br>
those materials which are compatible, that is biocompatible, with the eye so as to<br>
cause no substantial interference with the functioning or physiology of the eye. Such<br>
materials preferably are at least partially and more preferably substantially<br>
completely biodegradable or bioerodible.<br>
Examples of useful polymeric materials include, without limitation, such<br>
materials derived from and/or including organic esters and organic ethers, which<br>
when degraded result in physiologically acceptable degradation products, including<br>
the monomers. Also, polymeric materials derived from and/or including, anhydrides,<br>
amide's, orthoesters and the like, by themselves or in combination with other<br>
monomers, may also find use. The polymeric materials may be addition or<br>
condensation polymers, advantageously condensation polymers. The polymeric<br>
materials may be cross-linked or non-cross-linked, for example not more than lightly<br>
cross-linked, such as less than about 5%, or less than about 1% of the polymeric<br>
material being cross-linked. For the most part, besides carbon and hydrogen, the<br>
polymers will include at least one of oxygen and nitrogen, advantageously oxygen.<br>
The oxygen may be present as oxy, e.g. hydroxy or ether, carbonyl, e.g. non-oxocarbonyl,<br>
such as carboxylic acid ester, and the like. The nitrogen may be present<br>
as amide, cyano and amino. The polymers set forth in Heller, Biodegradable<br>
Polymers in Controlled Drug1 Delivery, In: CRC Critical Reviews in Therapeutic Drug<br>
Carrier Systems, Vol. 1, CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL 1987, pp 39-90, which<br>
describes encapsulation for controlled drug delivery, may find use in the present<br>
implants.<br>
Of additional interest are polymers of hydroxyaliphatic carboxylic acids, either<br>
homopolymers or copolymers, and polysaccharides. Polyesters of interest include<br>
polymers of D-laptic acid, L-lactic acid, racemic lactic acid, glycolic acid,<br>
polycaprolactone, and combinations thereof. Generally, by employing the L-lactate<br>
or D-lactate, a slowly eroding polymer or polymeric material is achieved, while<br>
erosion is substantially enhanced with the lactate racemate.<br>
Among the useful polysaccharides are, without limitation, calcium aiginate,<br>
and functionalized celluloses, particularly carboxymethylcellulose esters<br>
characterized by being water insoluble, a molecular weight of about 5 kD to 500 kD,<br>
for example.<br>
Other polymers of interest include, without limitation, polyvinyl alcohol,<br>
polyesters, polyethers and combinations thereof which are biocompatible and may<br>
be biodegradable and/or bioerodible.<br>
Some preferred characteristics of the polymers or polymeric materials for use<br>
in the present invention may include biocompatibility, compatibility with the<br>
therapeutic component, ease of use of the polymer in making the drug delivery<br>
systems of the present invention, a half-life in the physiological environment of at<br>
least about 6 hours, preferably greater than about one day, not significantly<br>
increasing the viscosity of the vitreous, and water insolubility.<br>
The biodegradable polymeric materials which are included to form the matrix<br>
are desirably subject to enzymatic or hydrolytic instability. Water soluble polymers<br>
may be cross-linked with hydrolytic or biodegradable unstable cross-links to provide<br>
useful water insoluble polymers. The degree of stability can be varied widely,<br>
depending upon the choice of monomer, whether a homopolymer or copolymer is<br>
employed, employing mixtures of polymers, and whether the polymer includes<br>
terminal acid groups.<br>
Equally important to controlling the biodegradation of the polymer and hence<br>
the extended release profile of the implant is the relative average molecular weight<br>
of the polymeric composition employed in the implant. Different molecular weights<br>
of the same or different polymeric compositions may be included in the implant to<br>
modulate the release profile. In certain implants, the relative average molecular<br>
weight of the polymer will range from about 9 to about 64 kD, usually from about 10<br>
to about 54 kD, and more usually from about 12 to about 45 kD.<br>
In some implants, copolymers of glycolic acid and lactic acid are used, where<br>
the rate of biodegradation is controlled by the ratio of glycolic acid to lactic acid. The<br>
most rapidly degraded copolymer has roughly equal amounts of giycolic acid and<br>
lactic acid. Homopolymers, or copolymers having ratios other than equal, are more<br>
resistant to degradation. The ratio of glycolic acid to lactic acid will also affect the<br>
brittleness of the implant, where a more flexible implant is desirable for larger<br>
geometries. The % of polylactic acid in the polylactic acid polyglycolic acid (PLGA)<br>
copolymer can be 0-100%, preferably about 15-85%, more preferably about 35-65%.<br>
In some implants, a 50/50 PLGA copolymer is used.<br>
The biodegradable polymer matrix of the intraocular implant may comprise a<br>
mixture of two or more biodegradable polymers. For example, the implant may<br>
comprise a mixture of a first biodegradable polymer and a different second<br>
biodegradable polymer. One or more of the biodegradable polymers may have<br>
terminal acid groups.<br>
Release of a drug from an erodible polymer is the consequence of several<br>
mechanisms or combinations of mechanisms. Some of these mechanisms include<br>
desorption from the implant's surface, dissolution, diffusion through porous channels<br>
of the hydrated polymer and erosion. Erosion can be bulk or surface or a<br>
combination of both. As discussed herein, the matrix of the intraocular implant may<br>
release drug at a rate effective to sustain release of an amount of the prostamide<br>
component for more than one week after implantation into an eye. In certain<br>
implants, therapeutic amounts of the prostamide component are released for no<br>
more than about 30-35 days after implantation. For example, an implant may<br>
comprise bimatoprost, and the matrix of the implant degrades at a rate effective to<br>
sustain release of a therapeuticaily effective amount of bimatoprost for about one<br>
month after being placed in an eye. As another example, the implant may comprise<br>
bimatoprost, and the matrix releases drug at a rate effective to sustain release of a<br>
therapeutically effective amount of bimatoprost for more than forty days, such as for<br>
about six months.<br>
One example of the biodegradable intraocular implant comprises an<br>
prostamide component associated with a biodegradable polymer matrix, which<br>
comprises a mixture of different biodegradable polymers. At least one of the<br>
biodegradable polymers is a polylactide having a molecular weight of about 63.3 kD.<br>
A second biodegradable polymer is a polylactide having a molecular weight of about<br>
14 kD. Such a mixture is effective in sustaining release of a therapeutically effective<br>
amount of the prostamide component for a time period greater than about one<br>
month from the time the implant is placed in an eye.<br>
Another example of a biodegradable intraocular implant comprises an<br>
prostamide component associated with a biodegradable polymer matrix, which<br>
comprises a mixture of different biodegradable polymers, each biodegradable<br>
polymer having an inherent viscosity from about 0.16 dl/g to about 1.0 dl/g. For<br>
example, one of the biodegradable polymers may have an inherent viscosity of<br>
about 0.3 dl/g. A second biodegradable polymer may have an inherent viscosity of<br>
about 1.0 dl/g. Additional implants may comprise biodegradable polymers that have<br>
an inherent viscosity between about 0.2 dl/g and 0.5 dl/g. The inherent viscosities<br>
identified above may be determined in 0.1% chloroform at 25°C.<br>
One particular implant comprises bimatoprost associated with a combination<br>
of two different polylactide polymers. The bimatoprost is present in about 20% by<br>
weight of the implant. One polylactide polymer has a molecular weight of about 14<br>
kD and an inherent viscosity of about 0.3 dl/g, and the other polylactide polymer has<br>
a molecular weight of about 63.3 kD and an inherent viscosity of about 1.0 dl/g. The<br>
two polylactide polymers are present in the implant in a 1:1 ratio. Such an implant<br>
may be effective in releasing the bimatoprost for more than two months. The<br>
implant is provided in the form of a rod or a filament produced by an extrusion<br>
process.<br>
The release of the-prostamide component from the intraocular implant<br>
comprising a biodegradable polymer matrix may include an initial burst of release<br>
followed by a gradual increase in the amount of the prostamide component released,<br>
or the release may include an initial delay in release of the prostamide component<br>
followed by an increase in release. When the implant is substantially completely<br>
degraded, the percent of the prostamide component that has been released is about<br>
one hundred. Compared to existing implants, the implants disclosed herein do not<br>
completely release, or release about 100% of the prostamide component, until after<br>
about one week of being placed in an eye.<br>
It may be desirable to provide a relatively constant rate of release of the<br>
prostamide component from the implant over the life of the implant. For example, it<br>
may be desirable for the prostamide component to be released in amounts from<br>
about 0.01 jjg to about 2 /jg per day for the life of the implant. However, the release<br>
rate may change to either increase or decrease depending on the formulation of the<br>
biodegradable polymer matrix. In addition, the release profile of the prostamide<br>
component may include one or more linear portions and/or one or more non-linear<br>
portions. Preferably, the release rate is greater than zero once the implant has<br>
begun to degrade or erode.<br>
The implants may be monolithic, i.e. having the active agent or agents<br>
homogenously distributed through the polymeric matrix, or encapsulated, where a<br>
reservoir of active agent is encapsulated by the polymeric matrix. Due to ease of<br>
manufacture, monolithic implants are usually preferred over encapsulated forms.<br>
However, the greater control afforded by the encapsulated, reservoir-type implant<br>
may be of benefit in some circumstances, where the therapeutic level of the drug<br>
falls within a narrow window. In addition, the therapeutic component, including the<br>
prostamide component, may be distributed in a non-homogenous pattern in the<br>
matrix. For example, the implant may include a portion that has a greater<br>
concentration of the prostamide component relative to a second portion of the<br>
implant.<br>
The intraocular implants disclosed herein may have a size of between about<br>
Sum and about 10 mm, or between about 10 urn and about 1 mm for administration<br>
with a needle, greater than 1 mm, or greater than 2 mm, such as 3 mm or up to 10<br>
mm, for administration by surgical implantation. For needle-injected implants, the<br>
implants may have any appropriate length so long as the diameter of the implant<br>
permits the implant to move through a needle. For example, implants having a<br>
length of about 6 mm to about 7 mm have been injected into an eye. The implants<br>
administered by way of a needle should have a diameter that is less than the inner<br>
diameter of the needle. In certain implants, the diameter is less than about 500 //m.<br>
The vitreous chamber in humans is able to accommodate relatively large implants of<br>
varying geometries, having lengths of, for example, 1 to 10 mm. The implant may<br>
be a cylindrical pellet (e. g., rod) with dimensions of about 2 mm x 0.75 mm<br>
diameter. Or the implant may be a cylindrical pellet with a length of about 7 mm to<br>
about 10 mm, and a diameter of about 0.75 mm to about 1.5 mm.<br>
The implants may also be at least somewhat flexible so as to facilitate both<br>
insertion of the implant in the eye, such as in the vitreous, and accommodation of<br>
the implant. The total weight of the implant is usually about 250-5000 fjg, more<br>
preferably about 500-1000 //g. For example, an implant may be about 500 //g, or<br>
about 1000 //g. For non-human individuals, the dimensions and total weight of the<br>
implant(s) may be larger or smaller, depending on the type of individual. For<br>
example, humans have a vitreous volume of approximately 3.8 ml, compared with<br>
approximately 30 ml for horses, and approximately 60-100 ml for elephants. An<br>
implant sized for use in a human may be scaled up or down accordingly for other<br>
animals, for example, about 8 times larger for an implant for a horse, or about, for<br>
example, 26 times larger for an implant for an elephant.<br>
Thus, implants can be prepared where the center may be of one material and<br>
the surface may have one or more layers of the same or a different composition,<br>
where the layers may be cross-linked, or of a different molecular weight, different<br>
density or porosity, or the-like. For example, where it is desirable to quickly release<br>
an initial bolus of drug, the center may be a polylactate coated with a polylactatepolyglycolate<br>
copolymer, so as to enhance the rate of initial degradation.<br>
Alternatively, the center may be polyvinyl alcohol coated with polylactate, so that<br>
upon degradation of the polylactate exterior the center would dissolve and be rapidly<br>
washed out of the eye.<br>
'The implants may be of any geometry including fibers, sheets, films,<br>
microspheres, spheres, circular discs, plaques and the like. The upper limit for the<br>
implant size will be determined by factors such as toleration for the implant, size<br>
limitations on insertion, ease of handling, etc. Where sheets or films are employed,<br>
the sheets or films will be in the range of at least about 0.5 mm x 0.5 mm, usually<br>
about 3-10 mm x 5-10 mm with a thickness of about 0.1 -1.0 mm for ease of<br>
handling. Where fibers are employed, the fiber diameter will generally be in the<br>
range of about 0.05 to 3 mm and the fiber length will generally be in the range of<br>
about 0.5-10 mm. Spheres may be in the range of about 0.5 jt;m to 4 mm in<br>
diameter, with comparable volumes for other shaped particles.<br>
The size and form of the implant can also be used to control the rate of<br>
release, period of treatment, and drug concentration at the site of implantation.<br>
Larger implants will deliver a proportionately larger dose, but depending on the<br>
surface to mass ratio, may have a slower release rate. The particular size and<br>
geometry of the implant are chosen to suit the site of implantation.<br>
The proportions of the prostamide component, polymer, and any other<br>
modifiers may be empirically determined by formulating several implants with<br>
varying proportions. A DSP approved method for dissolution or release test can be<br>
used to measure the rate of release (USP 23; NF 18 (1995) pp. 1790-1798). For<br>
example, using the infinite sink method, a weighed sample of the implant is added to<br>
a measured volume of a solution containing 0.9% NaCi in water, where the solution<br>
volume will be such that the drug concentration is after release is less than 5% of<br>
saturation. The mixture is maintained at 37°C and stirred slowly to maintain the<br>
implants in suspension. The appearance of the dissolved drug as a function of time<br>
may be followed by various methods known in the art, such as<br>
spectrophotometrically, HPLC, mass spectroscopy, etc. until the absorbance<br>
becomes constant or until greater than 90% of the drug has been released.<br>

The amount of active agent or agents employed in the! implant, individually or<br>
in combination, will vary widely depending on the effective dosage required and the<br>
desired rate of release from the implant. Usually the agent will be at least about 1,<br>
more usually at least about 10 weight percent of the implant, and usually not more<br>
than about 80, more usually not more than about 40 weight percent of the implant.<br>
Some of the present implants may comprise a prostamide component that<br>
comprises a combination of two or more different prostamide derivatives. One<br>
implant may comprise a combination of bimatoprost and latanoprost. Another<br>
implant may comprise a combination of bimatoprost and travoprost.<br>

may comprise a combination of bimatoprost and a carbonic anyhdrase inhibitor. For<br>
example, the implant may comprise a combination of bimatoprost and dorzolamide<br>
(Trusopt®).<br>
In addition to the therapeutic component, the intraocular implants disclosed<br>
herein may include effective amounts of buffering agents, preservatives and the like.<br>
Suitable water soluble buffering agents include, without limitation, alkali and alkaline<br>
earth carbonates, phosphates, bicarbonates, citrates, borates, acetates, succinates<br>
and the like, such as sodium phosphate, citrate, borate, acetate, bicarbonate,<br>
carbonate and the like. These agents advantageously present in amounts sufficient<br>
to maintain a pH of the system of between about 2 to about 9 and more preferably<br>
about 4 to about 8. As such the buffering agent may be as much as about 5% by<br>
weight of the total implant. Suitable water soluble preservatives include sodium<br>
bisulfite, sodium bisulfate, sodium thiosulfate, ascorbate, benzalkonium chloride,<br>
chloro'butanol, thimerosal, phenylmercuric acetate, phenylmercuric borate,<br>
phenylmercuric nitrate, parabens, methylparaben, polyvinyl alcohol, benzyl alcohol,<br>
phenylethanol and the like and mixtures thereof. These agents may be present in<br>
amounts of from 0.001 to about 5% by weight and preferably 0.01 to about 2% by<br>
weight. In at least one of the present implants, a benzylalkonium chloride<br>
preservative is provided in the implant, such as when the prostamide component<br>
consists essentially of bimatoprost.<br>
In some situations mixtures of implants may be utilized employing the same<br>
or different pharmacological agents. In this way, a cocktail of release profiles, giving<br>
a biphasic or triphasic release with a single administration is achieved, where the<br>
pattern of release may be greatly varied.<br>
Additionally, release modulators such as those described in U. S. Patent No.<br>
5,869,079 may be included in the implants. The amount of release modulator<br>
erhployed will be dependent on the desired release profile, the activity of the<br>
modulator, and on the release profile of the prostamide component in the absence of<br>
modulator. Electrolytes such as sodium chloride and potassium chloride may also<br>
be included in the implant. Where the buffering agent or enhancer is hydrophilic, it<br>
may also act as a release accelerator. Hydrophilic additives act to increase the<br>
release rates through faster dissolution of the material surrounding the drug<br>
28<br>
particles, which increases the surface area of the drug exposed, thereby increasing<br>
the rate of drug bioerosion. Similarly, a hydrophobic buffering agent or enhancer<br>
dissolve more slowly, slowing the exposure of drug particles, and thereby slowing<br>
the rate of drug bioerosion.<br>
In certain implants, an implant comprising bimatoprost and a biodegradable<br>
polymer matrix is able to release or deliver an amount of bimatoprost between about<br>
0.1 mg to about 0.5 mg for about 3-6 months after implantation into the eye. The<br>
implant may be configured as a rod or a wafer. A rod-shaped implant may be<br>
derived from filaments extruded from a 720 (o.m nozzle and cut into 1 mg size. A<br>
wafer-shaped implant may be a circular disc having a diameter of about 2.5 mm, a<br>
thickness of about 0.127 mm, and a weight of about 1 mg.<br>
Various techniques may be employed to produce the implants described<br>
herein. Useful techniques include, but are not necessarily limited to, solvent<br>
evaporation methods, phase separation methods, interfacial methods, molding<br>
methods, injection molding methods, extrusion methods, co-extrusion methods,<br>
carver press method, die cutting methods, heat compression, combinations thereof<br>
and the like.<br>
Specific methods are discussed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,997,652. Extrusion<br>
methods may be used to avoid the need for solvents in manufacturing. When using<br>
extrusion methods, the polymer and drug are chosen so as to be stable at the<br>
temperatures required for manufacturing, usually at least about 85 degrees Celsius.<br>
Extrusion methods use temperatures of about 25 degrees C to about 150 degrees<br>
C, more preferably about 65 degrees C to about 130 degrees C. An implant may be<br>
produced by bringing the temperature to about 60 degrees C to about 150 degrees<br>
C for drug/polymer mixing, such as about 130 degrees C, for a time period of about<br>
0 to 1 hour, 0 to 30 minutes, or 5-15 minutes. For example, a time period may be<br>
about 10 minutes, preferably about 0 to 5 min. The implants are then extruded at a<br>
temperature of about 60 degrees C to about 130 degrees C, such as about 75<br>
degrees C.<br>
In addition, the implant may be coextruded so that a coating is formed over a<br>
core region during the manufacture of the implant.<br>
Compression methods may be used to make the implants, and typically yield<br>
implants with faster release rates than extrusion methods. Compression methods<br>
may use pressures of about 50-150 psi, more preferably about 70-80 psi, even more<br>
preferably about 76 psi, and use temperatures of about 0 degrees C to about 115<br>
degrees C, more preferably about 25 degrees C.<br>
The implants of the present invention may be inserted into the eye, for<br>
example the vitreous chamber of the eye, by a variety of methods, including<br>
placement by forceps or by trocar following making a 2-3 mm incision in the sclera.<br>
One example of a device that may be used to insert the implants into an eye is<br>
disclosed in U.S. Patent Publication No. 2004/0054374. The method of placement<br>
may influence the therapeutic component or drug release kinetics. For example,<br>
delivering the implant with a trocar may result in placement of the implant deeper<br>
within the vitreous than placement by forceps, which may result in the implant being<br>
closer to the edge of the vitre'ous. The location of the implant may influence the<br>
concentration gradients of therapeutic component or drug surrounding the element,<br>
and thus influence the release rates (e.g., an element placed closer to the edge of<br>
the vitreous may result in a slower release rate).<br>
The present implants are configured to release an amount of prostamide<br>
component effective to treat an ocular condition, such as by reducing at least one<br>
symptom of the ocular condition. More specifically, the implants may be used in a<br>
method to treat glaucoma, such as open angle glaucoma, ocular hypertension,<br>
chronic angle-closure glaucoma, with patent iridotomy, psuedoexfoliative glaucoma,<br>
and pigmentary glaucoma. By implanting the prostamide component-containing<br>
implants into the vitreous of an eye, it is believed that the prostamide component is<br>
effective to enhance acqueous humour flow thereby reducing intraocular pressure.<br>

In one embodiment, an implant, such as the implants disclosed herein, is<br>
administered to a posterior segment of an eye of a human or animal patient, and<br>
preferably, a living human or animal. In at least one embodiment, an implant is<br>
administered without accessing the subretinal space of the eye. For example, a<br>
method of treating a patient may include placing the implant directly into the<br>
posterior chamber of the eye. In other embodiments, a method of treating a patient<br>
may comprise administerfng an implant to the patient by at least one of intravitreal<br>
injection, subconjuctival injection, sub-tenon injections, retrobulbar injection, and<br>
suprachoroidal injection.<br>
In at least one embodiment, a method of reducing intraocular pressure in an<br>
eye of a patient comprises administering one or more implants containing a<br>
prostamide component, as disclosed herein to a patient by at least one of intravitreal<br>
injecti'on, subconjuctival injection, sub-tenon injection, retrobulbar injection, and<br>
suprachoroidal injection. A syringe apparatus including an appropriately sized<br>
needle, for example, a 22 gauge needle, a 27 gauge needle or a 30 gauge needle,<br>
can be effectively used to inject the composition with the posterior segment of an<br>
eye of a human or animal. Repeat injections are often not necessary due to the<br>
extended release of the prostamide component from the implants.<br>
In addition, for dual therapy approaches to treating an ocular condition, the<br>
method may include one or more additional steps of administering additional<br>
therapeutic agents to the eye, such as by topically administering compositions<br>
containing timolol, dorzolamide, and iatoprost, among others.<br>
In another aspect of the invention, kits for treating an ocular condition of the<br>
eye are provided, comprising: a) a container comprising an extended release<br>
implant'comprising a therapeutic component including a prostamide component,<br>
such as bimatoprost (Lumigan), and a drug release sustaining component; and b)<br>
instructions for use. Instructions may include steps of how to handle the implants,<br>
how to insert the implants into an ocular region, and what to expect from using the<br>
implants.<br>
In certain implants, the implant comprises a therapeutic component which<br>
consists essentially of bimatoprost, salts thereof, and mixtures thereof, and a<br>
biodegradable polymer matrix. The biodegradable polymer matrix may consist<br>
essentially of PLA, PLGAror a combination thereof. When placed in the eye, the<br>
implant releases about 40% to about 60% of the bimatoprost to provide a loading<br>
dose of the bimatoprost within about one day after placement in the eye.<br>
Subsequently, the implant releases about 1% to about 2% of the bimatoprost per<br>
day to provide a sustained therapeutic effect. Such implants may be effective in<br>
reducing and maintaining a reduced intraocular pressure, such as below about 15<br>
mm Hg for several months, and potentially for one or two years.<br>
Other implants disclosed herein may be configured such that the amount of<br>
the prostamide component that is released from the implant' within two days of being<br>
placed in the eye is less than about 95% of the total amount of the prostamide<br>
component in the implant. In certain implants, 95% of the prostamide component is<br>
not released until after about one week of being placed in an eye. In certain<br>
implants, about 50% of the prostamide component is released within about one day<br>
of placement in the eye, and about 2% is released for about 1 month after being<br>
placed in the eye. In other implants, about 50% of the prostamide component is<br>
released within about one day of placement in the eye, and about 1 % is released for<br>
about 2 months after being placed in the eye.<br>
Example 1<br>
Manufacture and testing of implants containing bimatoprost and a biodegradable<br>
polymer matrix<br>
Biodegradable implants were made by combining bimatoprost with a<br>
biodegradable polymer composition. 800 mg of polylactic acid (PLA) was combined<br>
with 200 mg of bimatoprost. The combination was dissolved in 25 milliliters of<br>
dichloromethane. The mixture was placed in a vacuum at 45°C overnight to<br>
evaporate the dichloromethane. The resulting mixture was in the form of a cast<br>
sheet. The cast sheet was cut and ground in a high shear grinder with dry ice until<br>
the particles could pass through a sieve having a pore size of about 125 /vm. The<br>
percent of bimatoprost-present-in the microparticles was analyzed using high<br>
pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC). The percent release of bimatoprost from<br>
the microparticles was profiled using dialysis. The percent of bimatoprost remaining<br>
in the recovered particles was analyzed by HPLC.<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
The percent loading of bimatoprost was 14.93%. The percent of bimatoprost<br>
remaining in the recovered release particles was 4.94%.<br>
Example 2.<br>
Extrusion process and compression of manufacturing bimatoprost-containing<br>
biodegradable intraocular implants.<br>
' Bimatoprost is combined with a biodegradable polymer composition in a<br>
mortar. The combination is mixed with a shaker set at about 96 RPM for about 15<br>
minutes. The powder blend is scraped off the wall of the mortar and is then remixed<br>
for an additional 15 minutes. The mixed powder blend is heated to a semi-molten<br>
state at specified temperature for a total of 30 minutes, forming a polymer/drug melt.<br>
Rods are manufactured by pelletizing the polymer/drug melt using a 9 gauge<br>
polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) tubing, loading the pellet into the barrel and extruding<br>
the material at the specified core extrusion temperature into filaments. The filaments<br>
are then cut into about 1 mg size implants or drug delivery systems. The rods may<br>
have dimensions of about 2 mm long x 0.72 mm diameter. The rod implants weigh<br>
between about 900 /jg and 1100 jug.<br>
Wafers are formed by flattening the polymer melt with a Carver press at a<br>
specified temperature and cutting the flattened material into wafers, each weighing<br>
about 1 mg. The wafers have a diameter of about 2.5 mm and a thickness of about<br>
0.13 mm. The wafer implants weigh between about 900 fjg and 1100 //g.<br>
In-vitro release testing is performed by placing each implant into a 24 mL<br>
screw cap vial with 10 ml of Phosphate Buffered Saline solution at 37°C. 1 ml<br>
aliquots are removed and are replaced with equal volume of fresh medium on day 1,<br>
4, 7, 14, 28, and every two weeks thereafter.<br>
Drug assays are performed by HPLC, which consists of a Waters 2690<br>
Separation Module (or 2696), and a Waters 2996 Photodiode Array Detector. An<br>
Ultrasphere, C-18 (2), 5 p,m; 4.6 x 150 mm column heated at 30 ° C is used for<br>
separation and the detector is set at about 264 nm. The mobile phase is (10:90)<br>
MeOH -'buffered mobile phase with a flow rate of 1 mL/min and a total run time of 12<br>
min per sample. The buffered mobile phase may comprise (68:0.75:0.25:31) 13 mM<br>
1 -Heptane Sulfonic Acid, sodium salt - glacial acetic acid - triethylamine - Methanoi.<br>
The release rates are determined by calculating the amount of drug being released<br>
in a given volume of medium over time in u,g/day.<br>
Polymers which may be used in the implants can be obtained from<br>
Boehringer Ingelheim. Examples of polymer insclude: RG502, RG752, R202H,<br>
R203 and R206, and Purac PDLG (50/50). RG502 is (50:50) poly(D,L-lactide-co-<br>
glycolide), RG752 is (75:25) poly(D,L-lactide-co-glycolide), R202H is 100% poly(D,<br>
L-lactide) with acid end group or terminal acid groups, R203 and R206 are both<br>
100% poly(D, L-lactide). Purac PDLG (50/50) is (50:50) poly(D,L-lactide-coglycolide).<br>
The inherent viscosity of RG502, RG752, R202H, R203, R206 , and<br>
Purac PDLG are 0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.3, 1.0, and 0.2 dL/g, respectively. The average<br>
molecular weight of RG502, RG752, R202H, R203, R206, and Purac PDLG are,<br>
11700, 11200, 6500, 14000, 63300, and 9700 daltons, respectively.<br>
