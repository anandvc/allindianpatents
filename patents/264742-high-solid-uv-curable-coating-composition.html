				<td>HIGH-SOLID UV-CURABLE COATING COMPOSITION<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a UV-curable coating composition having a low solvent content which provides a good coating film without causing environmental or processability problems.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
There.have been developed various coating compositions such as powder-coating, water-born coating, UV-curable-coating, and high-solid coating compositions, among which UV-curable coating compositions have been widely employed. However, a typical UV-curable composition contains a large quantity, e.g., 45 to 60% by weight of a volatile organic solvent, and when used for spray coating, dip coating, flow coating or spin coating, it causes air pollution, worker's health problem, deformation of the coated substrate, and ineffective energy use.<br>
Thus, there has been a need to develop an environment-friendly UV-curable composition which can minimize problems earned by the use of volatile organic compounds.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Accordingly, it is a primary object of the present invention to provide a high-solid UV-curable coating composition containing 10 % by weight or less of an organic solvent which exhibits improved workability and environmental acceptability in obtaining a coating film having improved properties.<br>
In accordance with one aspect of the present invention, there is provided a UV-curable coating composition comprising 20 to 60 % by weight of a reactive acrylate oligomer, 20 to 60 % by weight of a UV-curable monomer, 1 to 10 % by weight of an organic solvent and 1 to 10 % by weight of a photoinitiator based on the total weight of the composition, wherein the reactive acrylate oligomer has 4 to 9 functional acrylate groups and exhibits a viscosity of 500 to 20,000 cps (centipoise) at room temperature.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The high-solid UV-curable coating composition of the present invention is characterized by comprising a multifunctional acrylate oligomer having a low viscosity at room temperature and 10 % by weight of less of an organic solvent.<br>
The multifunctional acrylate oligomer used in the present invention is a reactive acrylate which has 4 to 9 functional acrylate groups and exhibits a low viscosity of 500 to 20,000 cps at room temperature. Representative examples of the acrylate oligomer include a mixture of dipentaerythritol pentaacrylate and dipentaerythritol hexaacrylate.<br>
In the present invention, the acrylate oligomer is used in an amount ranging from 20 to 60% by weight, preferably from 30 to 40% by weight based on the total weight of the composition. When the amount is more than 60 % by weight, the cured coating film becomes brittle due to an excessively high crosslinking density and suffers from crack generation by heat or impact, and when less than 20% by weight, mechanical properties of the coating film become poor.<br>
Representative examples of the UV-curable monomer used in the present<br>
invention, which acts to control the viscosity of the oligomer as a reactive diluent<br>
include	pentaerythritol	tri/tetraacrylate(PETA),	trimethylolpropane<br>
triacrylate(TMPTA), hexamethylene diacrylate(HDDA), 2-hydroxyethyl acrylate(2-HEA), 2-hydroxypropyl acrylate(2-HPA), isobornyl acrylate(IBOA) and the like. The monomer is used in an amount ranging from 20 to 60% by weight, preferably from 25 to 55% by weight based on the total weight of the composition. When the amount is more than 60 % by weight, the curing rate becomes low, and mechanical and chemical properties of the coating film become poor, and when less than 20% by weight, the workability and leveling ability deteriorate.<br>
Representative examples of the organic solvent used in the present invention include methyl isobutyl ketone, methyl ethyl ketone, dimethyl ketone, isopropyl alcohol, isobutyl alcohol, normal butyl alcohol, ethyl acetate, normal butyl acetate, ethyl cellosolve, butyl cellosolve and the like. The organic solvent is used in an amount ranging from 1 to 10% by weight, preferably from 5 to 10% by weight based on the total weight of the composition. When the amount is more than 10% by weight, the desired effect expected by reducing the amount of the volatile organic compound is not accomplished, and when less than 1% by weight,<br>
effective blending cannot be formed.<br>
The composition of the present invention comprises a photoinitiator which functions to generate radicals by UV to initiate the crosslinking of unsaturated hydrocarbons. Representative examples of the photoinitiator include 1-hydroxycyclohexyl phenyl ketone(IRGACURE 184), bis(2,4,6-trimethyl benzoyl) phenyl phosphine oxide(IRGACURE 819), 2,4,6-trimethylbenzoyl diphenyl phosphine(TPO), 2-hydroxy-2-methyl-l -phenyl-l-propane(DAROCUR 1173), benzophenone(BP) and the like, and it is used in an amount ranging from 1 to 10% by weight, preferably from 5 to 7% by weight based on the total weight of the composition.<br>
In order to enhance the slip and gloss characteristics of the coating film, the inventive coating composition may further comprise a leveling agent in an amount ranging from 0.1 to 2% by weight based on the total weight of the composition, the leveling agent being any of the conventional materials used in the coating composition, preferably polysiloxan, e.g., BYK-300, BYK-333, BYK-310 (commercially available from BYK chemie Co.).<br>
In addition, so as to enhance the property of the coating film, the inventive coating composition may further comprise additives such as XP-0396, XP-0596 and XP-0746 (commercially available from hanse chemie Co.) in an amount ranging from 0.1 to 2% by weight based on the total weight of the composition.<br>
The inventive composition may be prepared by mixing the low viscosity multifunctional acrylate oligomer, UV-curable monomer and organic solvent in suitable amounts and adding thereto the photoinitiator, as well as the optional leveling agent and other additives, with stirring.<br>
In accordance with the present invention, the coating film may be prepared by spray coating, dip coating, flow coating or spin coating the inventive composition on the surface of a substrate to form a UV-curable film thereon, drying the UV-curable film at room temperature and curing the dried film by means of UV irradiation. When a spray coating method is employed it is desirable to dry the coated film at room temperature for 1 to 2 min.<br>
The inventive coating film may have a thickness ranging from 5 to 50 µm, and have improved properties in term of adhesion, pencil hardness, gloss and moisture-, chemical-, abrasion- and acid-resistance.<br>
As described above, the inventive UV-curable coating composition containing a very small quantity of the organic solvent has good workability and<br>
acceptable environmental characteristics, and is capable of providing a coating film having improved properties. Accordingly, it is useful for the coating of products such as mobile phones, automobiles and electronic appliances.<br>
The. following Examples and Comparative Examples are given for the purpose of illustration only and are not intended to limit the scope of the invention.<br>
Preparation of UV-curable coating compositions&gt; Example 1<br>

'-Preparation of coating films&gt; Examples 5 to'-8<br>
The high-solid UV-curable coating compositions obtained in Examples 1 to 4 were each coated on a polycarbonate substrate coated with a UVP primer (for a UV-curable top coat) by spray coating, which was subject to drying at room temperature (25 °C) for 1 to 2 min to remove a trace amount of residual organic solvent. The dried coated substrate was cured twice at a line speed of 10/min and a light intensity of 300 mJ/cm2 with a fusion lamp(Fusion System Co.) to prepare a 15-20 µm thick coating film.<br>
Comparative Example 2<br>
The procedure of Examples 5 to 8 was repeated except for using the UV-curable coating composition obtained in Comparative Example 1 and drying at 60 °C for 1 to 2 min to remove the residual organic solvent, to prepare a 15 — 20<br>
µM thick coating film.<br>
Assay of film properties Experimental Example<br>
The physical and chemical characteristics of the coating films obtained in Examples 5 to 8 and Comparative Example 2 were evaluated in accordance with the following methods.<br>
(1)	Adhesion Property : ASTM D3359-87<br>
A coating film was cut in a checkered pattern at 1mm intervals to form 100 1mm x 1mm squares. An adhesive test tape was firmly attached to the formed pattern and removed at an angle of 180 degrees by a sharp peeling motion, which was repeated three times. The state of the pattern was examined and the results were evaluated according to the following criteria:<br>
5B.: peeling at the cut edge or within the patterned area is absent<br>
4B : slight peeling at the cut edge - the area peeled is less than 5% of the patterned area<br>
3B : some peeling and breakage at the cut edge - the area peeled is less than 15% of the patterned area<br>
2B : considerable peeling and breakage at the cut edge and within the patterned area - the area peeled is less than 35% of the patterned area<br>
1B : extensive ribbon-type peeling - the area peeled is in the range from 35 to 65% of the pattern area<br>
OB : poor adhesiveness - the area peeled is more than 65% of the patterned area<br>
(2)	Pencil Hardness : ASTM D3363-74<br>
A test coating film was scratched with a pencil of varying hardness under a constant pressure at an angle of 45 degrees, which was repeated five times. The hardness value of the pencil produced only one scratch or breakage of the coating layer is referred to as the pencil hardness.<br>
(3)	Gloss<br>
The gloss value of a test coating film was measured at light acceptance and incident angles of 60 degrees with a BYK-GARDNER glossmeter, and the result obtained was expressed as a percentage value based on the gloss value of the base plane of 100.<br>
(4)	Abrasion resistance<br>
The surface of a test coating film was rubbed with an eraser under a 500g-load at a rate of 40 times/min. The state of the resulting material was examined with the naked eye.<br>
(5)	Chemical resistance<br>
The surface of a coating film was dipped in 99.3% methanol, followed by rubbing with an eraser under a 500g-load at a rate of 40 times/min. The state of the resulting material was examined with the naked eye.<br>
(6)	Moisture resistance<br>
The degree of aspect deformation and adhesion property were tested after exposing a test specimen to a condition of 50 °C and 95% relative humidity for 72 hours.<br>
(7)	Acid resistance<br>
The degree of aspect deformation and adhesion property were tested after treating a test specimen with a standard pH 4.6 solution for 72 hours.<br>
(8)	UV test (QUV)<br>
The degree of aspect deformation and adhesion property were tested after keeping a test specimen for 72 hours in a UV tester(QUV, Q-Pannel).<br>
The physical properties of the coating films thus measured are showed in Table 1.<br>
Table 1  (Table Removed)<br>
As shown in Table 1, the coating films obtained using the inventive compositions exhibit improved characteristics in terms of adhesion property, pencil hardness, gloss, abrasion resistance, chemical resistance, moisture resistance and acid resistance, as compared to those obtained using conventional compositions.<br>
