METHOD OF PRODUCING THERMOPLASTIC POLIMER SOLUTION<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001]<br>
The present invention relates to a method of producing a solution of a<br>
thermoplastic polymer and/or a solution of a deplymerization product of a thermoplastic<br>
polymer providing a raw material for paints, polymer powders and the like. Furthermore,<br>
the present invention also relates to a method of cleaning any polymer, polymerization<br>
intermediate, or modified products thereof left within a melt polymerization reactor that is<br>
used for producing a polycondensation polymer by supplying a polymerization<br>
intermediate, in a melted state, from a raw material supply port to the interior of the melt<br>
polymerization reactor, and the intermediate is then discharged through the holes of<br>
polymerization intermediate through the holes of a perforated plate, and then producing<br>
the polycondensation polymer while the polymerization intermediate flows down the<br>
surface of the support disposed inside the reactor.<br>
[0002]<br>
The present application is claimed priority to the Japanese patent application No.<br>
2005-055258 filed on March 1, 2005, Japanese patent application No. 2005-055262 filed on<br>
March 1,2005, and the Japanese patent application No. 2005-055263 filed on March 1,2005,<br>
and the content of which is herein incorporated.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
[0003]<br>
Thermoplastic polymers typified by polyester resins such as polyethylene<br>
terephthalate (hereafter abbreviated as PET) feature superior levels of heat resistance and<br>
mechanical properties.<br>
In recent years, polyester resins have also begun to attract attention as<br>
environmentally friendly materials that are capable of being recycled, and these resins are<br><br>
-2-<br>
now widely used as fibers, magnetic tapes, packaging films, sheets, injection molded<br>
products for all manner of applications, preforms for the production of drink containers,<br>
and so forth.<br>
Furthermore, solutions of thermoplastic polymers and/or solutions of<br>
depolymerization products of thermoplastic polymers obtained by dissolving a<br>
thermoplastic polymer and/or a depolymerization product of a thermoplastic polymer in a<br>
solvent can be used as paints, adhesives, coating agents, and binders and the like.<br>
Moreover, using polyester as an example, a water-dispersed composition obtained by<br>
dissolving the polyester in an organic solvent, mixing and dispersing this solution within<br>
water, and then removing the organic solvent can also be used as a coating agent, and a<br>
polyester powder can be produced by dispersing the polyester solution within an<br>
appropriate poor solvent to precipitate the polyester, and then collecting and drying the<br>
thus obtained powder.<br>
[0004]<br>
Examples of methods of dissolving a thermoplastic resin such as a polyester in a<br>
solvent include methods in which the solid-state polymer is shredded coarsely or<br>
processed into pellets before being dissolved in the solvent, and methods in which the<br>
melted polymer is added directly to the solvent, and is then stirred to effect dissolution.<br>
However, methods in which a solid-state polymer is dissolved tend to suffer from<br>
inadequate dissolution rates, even if the solvent is heated to improve the dissolution rate,<br>
meaning the time required for the dissolution process is overly long. Furthermore,<br>
methods in which a melted polymer is dissolved in the solvent tend to suffer different<br>
problems, including aggregation of the melted polymer within the solvent, which results<br>
in a slower dissolution rate, and solidification and accumulation of those portions of the<br>
polymer that exhibit poor fluidity during stirring within the solvent, which causes a<br>
deterioration in the solubility.<br>
[0005]<br>
In order to resolve the drawbacks outlined above, patent document 1 discloses a<br><br>
-3-<br>
method of producing a saturated copolyester resin solution that involves dissolving the<br>
saturated copolyester resin in a solvent, either by circulating the solution mixture during<br>
the stirring process, at such a rate that the quantity of circulated material relative to the<br>
total quantity of the solution mixture is at least 0.3/hour. or by blowing an inert gas<br>
through the solution mixture during the stirring process at a rate of at least 0.1/hour<br>
relative to the total quantity of the solution mixture.<br>
However, as with earlier methods, the dissolution rate for this method is not<br>
particularly high, meaning the method is not particularly efficient.<br>
[0006]<br>
Furthermore, because they are used in large quantities in wide variety of<br>
applications as described above, thermoplastic polymers, and particularly<br>
polycondensation polymers typified by PET, are responsible for the generation of large<br>
quantities of used polymer. The demand for used drink bottles generated is particularly<br>
significant, and the processing of these bottles poses a considerable social problem.<br>
Accordingly, much research is being conducted into the development of technologies for<br>
reusing used polymers.<br>
[0007]<br>
A number of methods have been proposed for reusing PET resins.<br>
In one such method, the impurities are first carefully removed from collected and<br>
sorted waste PET bottles, and a multitude of steps are then conducted to convert the PET<br>
to either pellet or flake form, which is then recycled for use as a fiber raw material. Other<br>
methods involve chemical recycling of the PET resin.<br>
[0008]<br>
Of the PET bottle chemical recycling methods that have been developed to date,<br>
the vast majority employ solvolysis, including hydrolysis methods that use water as the<br>
solvent and result in decomposition of the PET resin into terephthalic acid (hereafter<br>
abbreviated as TPA) and ethylene glycol (hereafter abbreviated as EG), and methods that<br>
use alcohols as the solvent and yield EG via alcoholysis.<br><br>
-4-<br>
[0009]<br>
Furthermore, methods of converting polyester waste products to monomers, and<br>
then collecting and reusing these monomers as the raw materials for further<br>
polymerization reactions to produce more polyester have also been proposed.<br>
Fundamentally, these methods enable the recycling of compounds with no loss, thereby<br>
enabling the reuse of resources.<br>
Using polyethylene terephthalate resin as an example of the polyester resin,<br>
examples of methods of recycling the monomers obtained by the depolymerization of the<br>
polyethylene terephthalate resin are disclosed in patent documents 2 through 5 listed<br>
below.<br>
[0010]<br>
The patent document 2 discloses a method of depolymerizing polyethylene<br>
terephthalate, wherein an extruder and a reactor provided at the exit of the extruder are<br>
used during a process of heating, melting, and depolymerizing the polyethylene<br>
terephthalate, and in addition to conducting the heating, melting, and depolymerization<br>
reaction of the polyethylene terephthalate, a glycol is introduced to the system at a point<br>
beyond the exit of the extruder, and this glycol and the polyethylene terephthalate are<br>
mixed together in a mixer provided between the extruder and the reactor.<br>
[0011]<br>
The patent document 3 discloses a method of producing a polyester wherein<br>
terephthalic acid obtained by the hydrolysis of recycled dimethyl terephthalate, which in<br>
turn is obtained by the methanol depolymerization of a polyalkylene terephthalate, is used<br>
for at least 70% by weight of the total acid component that constitutes the polyester, and a<br>
precipitate obtained by heating this terephthalic acid in a glycol using a specific catalyst is<br>
then subjected to a polycondensation reaction.<br>
[0012]<br>
The patent document 4 discloses a method of recycling polyester waste that<br>
includes successively the steps of (a) grinding and pretreating the polyester waste, (b)<br><br>
-5-<br>
subjecting the treated polyester waste from the step (a) to a depolymerization with<br>
alkylene glycol in the presence of a catalyst, (c) subjecting the depolymerization product<br>
obtained in the step (b) to a transesterification reaction with methanol in the presence of a<br>
catalyst, thus yielding a crude dimethyl terephthalate, (d) recrystallizing the crude<br>
dimethyl terephthalate obtained in the step (c) and then conducting further purification by<br>
methanol washing and/or distillation, thus enabling recovery of a high-purity dimethyl<br>
terephthalate, and (e) reacting the purified dimethyl terephthalate obtained in the step (d)<br>
with a 2-fold or greater large molar excess of an alkylene glycol, under normal pressure<br>
and with no catalyst, thereby enabling recovery of a low polymer mixture composed<br>
mainly of bis-b-hydroxyalkylene terephthalate and containing hydroxyalkylene ester<br>
groups at the terminals to enable recovery of a low polymer mixture composed mainly of<br>
bis-b-hydroxyalkylene terephthalate and containing hydroxyalkylene ester groups at the<br>
terminals.<br>
[0013]<br>
The patent document 5 discloses a method of producing a high-purity<br>
polyethylene terephthalate polymer that includes a pretreatment step of obtaining crude<br>
polyethylene terephthalate flakes from used polyethylene terephthalate waste by<br>
conducting a series of pretreatments such as grinding, washing, and foreign matter<br>
separation, a depolymerization step of subjecting the obtained crude polyethylene<br>
terephthalate flakes to a depolymerization in the presence of a catalyst by adding an<br>
excess of purified and/or crude ethylene glycol, thus yielding crude bis-b-hydroxyethyl<br>
terephthalate (BHET), a BHET purification step of removing foreign matter other than the<br>
polyethylene terephthalate resin from the binary mixture solution containing the obtained<br>
crude BHET and the crude ethylene glycol, thus yielding purified bis-b-hydroxyethyl<br>
terephthalate (BHET), and a step of conducting a melt polycondensation using the<br>
purified BHET as a raw material.<br>
[0014]<br>
In the depolymerization reaction described above, increasing the reaction rate<br><br>
-6-<br>
while reducing the quantity of depolymerization catalyst used is important from the<br>
perspectives of both cost and reaction efficiency, but none of the patent documents<br>
described above proposes a method or reactor that enables the depolymerization reaction<br>
to be conducted efficiently and at low cost.<br>
[0015]<br>
On the other hand, the various polycondensation polymers described above and<br>
typified by PET are also widely used in preforms for producing drink containers. These<br>
drink containers not only require the properties described above, but must also have no<br>
effect on the taste of the contents of the container. As a result, high-quality<br>
polycondensation polymers with a high polymerization degree, no coloring, and minimal<br>
quantities of impurities such as acetaldehyde are required.<br>
[0016]<br>
Moreover in recent years, in addition to the trend towards higher quality, the trend<br>
towards greater diversity in polymer applications has resulted in tests being conducted on<br>
overcoming certain drawbacks and improving polymer properties by conducting<br>
copolymerization with different monomers and blending improvers into the polymer in<br>
order to satisfy the demands for higher levels of performance.<br>
For example, in the case of PET containers, methods have been disclosed in<br>
which the crystallization rate can be increased, enabling high cycle molding and efficient<br>
crystallization of the bung portion of the molded bottle, by blending either a poly(ethylene<br>
terephthalate - ethylene terephthalamide) copolymer (see patent document 6) or a<br>
polyolefin (see patent document 7) into the PET. A method has also been disclosed for<br>
improving the transparency, moldability, and heat and pressure resistance of PET by<br>
conducting melt kneading with polyethylene naphthalate (see patent document 8).<br>
[0017]<br>
However, when improvers are melt kneaded into a polycondensation polymer,<br>
thermal decomposition of the polymer usually occurs, meaning a reduction in the<br>
molecular weight, and a deterioration in the polymer quality, such as the coloring and the<br><br>
-7-<br>
level of accumulation of decomposition products, are unavoidable. Methods in which the<br>
improvers are added directly to the reaction system used for producing the<br>
polycondensation polymer, thereby removing the need for a melt kneading process, are<br>
conceivable, but in most cases, the improver undergoes thermal degradation at the<br>
polymerization temperature of the polycondensation polymer, meaning the polymer<br>
quality, including the coloring and the level of accumulation of decomposition products,<br>
is actually inferior to that of the original polymer undergoing improvement. Even in<br>
methods in which another monomer is included in the copolymerization, because the<br>
melting point and thermal decomposition temperature vary from monomer to monomer<br>
other components with low levels of heat resistance also undergo thermal degradation<br>
under the polymerization conditions, causing the molecular weight to be reduced and the<br>
polymer quality such as the coloring and the level of accumulation of decomposition<br>
products to be inferior to that of the original polymer undergoing improvement.<br>
In these tests in which certain properties of the polymer are improved by the<br>
copolymerization of different monomers or the blending of improvers, the quality of the<br>
product polymer is significantly inferior to that of the original polymer, meaning<br>
significant improvements in the production technology are required.<br>
[0018]<br>
As a result of intensive research aimed at resolving the problems described above,<br>
the inventors of the present invention developed a polymerization method based on a<br>
novel principle, wherein in a method of producing a polycondensation polymer, a<br>
polymerization intermediate, in a melted state, is supplied from a raw material supply port<br>
to the polymerization reactor, is discharged through the holes of a perforated plate, and<br>
then undergoes polymerization under reduced pressure, while flowing down along the<br>
surface of a support, and the inventors discovered that this method enabled melt<br>
polymerization to be conducted at a significantly lower temperature than that attainable<br>
using conventional polymerization methods (see Japanese Patent Application No.<br>
2004-345246 and Japanese Patent Application No. 2004-345241).<br><br>
-8-<br>
The most preferred polymerization reactor used in the polymerization method of<br>
the present invention has a structure which includes no stirring device, and in which a<br>
plurality of narrow diameter wire-like support are disposed inside the polymerization<br>
reactor. However, after polymerization has been conducted using this polymerization<br>
reactor, when the operation is halted, the inside of the polymerization reactor is prone to<br>
the retention of residual polymerization intermediates, raw materials, and modified<br>
products thereof.<br>
[0019]<br>
A method of cleaning a conventional stirred tank-type polymerization reactor,<br>
wherein the inside of the polymerization reactor is filled with glycols , and the glycols are<br>
then heated to a temperature close to its boiling point while being stirred, thereby<br>
depolymerizing and removing any residual polymers and the like has already been<br>
disclosed (see patent document 9). However, if an attempt is made to apply this type of<br>
method to this polymerization reactor of the present invention described above, there was<br>
a problem of requiring very long time for carrying out depolymerization of the residual<br>
polymer, not only is a large quantity of residual polymer and the like retained on the<br>
support inside the polymerization reactor, but because the reactor is also not provided with<br>
a stirring device,<br>

MEANS FOR SOLVING THE PROBLEMS<br>
[0024]<br>
As a result of intensive research aimed at achieving the objects described above, the<br>
inventors of the present invention discovered that by supplying the thermoplastic polymer,<br>
in a melted state, from a raw material supply port to an appratus, discharging the<br>
thermoplastic polymer through the holes of a perforated plate, and then causing the<br><br>
-10-<br>
polymer to make contact with a solvent vapor while allowing the polymer to flow down<br>
along a support a thermoplastic polymer and/or depolymerization product of the<br>

thereby accomplishing the present invention.<br>
[0025]<br>

Advantages of the Invention<br>
[0028]<br>
A method of producing a solution of a thermoplastic polymer and/or a solution<br>
of a depolymerization product of a thermoplastic polymer, a method of depolymerizing a<br>
polycondensation polymer, and a method of cleaning a polymerization reactor for a<br>
polycondensation polymer according to the present invention exhibit the effects described<br>
below.<br>
(1)	By distributing the thermoplastic polymer using a perforated plate, a large quantity of<br>
polymer can be treated efficiently and evenly. Because the polymer is retained on the<br>
support, the surface area of the surface layer can be increased, thereby facilitating the<br>
contact between the polymer and the solvent vapor, and ensuring a more efficient<br>
dissolution process. Furthermore, because the polymers retained on each of the support<br>
does not merge to form aggregates, no deterioration occurs in the efficiency of the<br>
treatment process.<br>
(2)	By causing the thermoplastic polymer to fall down the surface of the support under the<br>
effects of gravity, dissolved and/or depolymerized polymers, which exhibit a lower<br>
viscosity, fall more rapidly, enabling the quantity of polymer treated to be increased.<br>
Furthermore, the solution of polymers and the like dissolved first within the surface layer<br>
falls down over the surface of polymer positioned closer to the interior, which has not yet<br>
dissolved (swollen) adequately and exhibits a comparatively higher viscosity,<br>
and consequently the interior polymer is stretched by the application of a shearing force.<br><br>
-14-<br>
thereby ensuring a more efficient dissolution and/or depolymerization.<br>
(3) By contacting with a solvent vapor, a large quantity of polymer can be readily<br>
dissolved using a small quantity of solvent, enabling the production of a solution with any<br>
desired viscosity from low viscosity through to high viscosity. By using at least one<br>
component contained within the solvent vapor functions as a molecular weight reducing<br>
agent for the thermoplastic polymer, the depolymerization can be conducted more<br>
efficiently.<br>
(4)Because the dissolution rate and/or the depolymerization rate can be increased, the<br>
dissolution time and/or depolymerization time can be reduced, deterioration in the<br>
product properties is few, and the generation of thermal degradation products and<br>
contamination caused by these thermal degradation products is also few.<br>

BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
[0031]<br>
First is a detailed description, for the method of producing a solution of a<br>
thermoplastic polymer and/or a solution of a depolymerization product of a thermoplastic<br>
polymer according to the present invention, of (A) a dissolution method, a<br>
depolymerization method, and a method of cleaning a polymerization reactor, (B) a<br>
thermoplastic polymer, (C) a solvent and a molecular weight reducing agent, (D) a<br>
dissolver and a dissolution method, (E) a depolymerization reactor and a<br>
depolymerization method, and (F) a polymerization reactor suited to a cleaning method of<br>
the present invention, and a method of cleaning such a reactor.<br>
[0032]<br>
(A) Dissolution Method, Depolymerization Method, and Method of Cleaning a<br>
Polymerization Reactor<br>
A dissolution method and/or a depolymerization method according to the<br>
present invention is a method of dissolving and/or depolymerizing a thermoplastic<br>
polymer that includes the steps of supplying the thermoplastic polymer, in a melted state,<br>
from a raw material supply port to a dissolver, discharging the polymer through the holes<br>
of a perforated plate, and then causing the polymer to make contact with a solvent vapor<br>
and/or the vapor of a molecular weight reducing agent while flowing down along the<br>
surface of a support disposed inside the reactor.<br>
By employing this method, the thermoplastic polymer that flows down alomg<br>
the support is distributed across each of the support, and while remaining retained by the<br>
support, flows down towards the bottom of the reactor (a dissolver, or depolymerization<br>
reactor or polymerization reactor) while undergoing dissolution and/or depolymerization,<br>
thereby exhibiting a behavior of rapid movement.<br>
[0033]<br><br>
-17-<br>
As a result, both the contact surface area between the polymer and the solvent<br>
vapor and/or vapor of the molecular weight reducing agent, and the mixing effect<br>
produced by the shearing force generated by the falling polymer solution increase<br>
dramatically, causing a significant increase in the treatment rate for the dissolution and/or<br>
depolymerization.<br>
In the case of the production of a solution of a thermoplastic polymer and/or a<br>
solution of a depolymerization product of a thermoplastic polymer, examples of suitable<br>
thermoplastic polymers that can be subjected to treatment include the melted resin after<br>
the end of polymerization reaction iself or solid-state polymers that have been pelletized<br>
or converted to sheet form, or melted recycled raw materials generated by collecting used<br>
molded products and then conducting a preliminary washing treatment, if required, prior<br>
to melting. Furthermore, in the case of a method of cleaning a polymerization reactor, the<br>
treatment target is the residual polycondensation polymer left within the polymerization<br>
reactor following polymerization and subsequent halting of the polymerization operation.<br>
[0034]<br>
On the basis of further research, the inventors discovered that the holes within<br>
the perforated plate of the dissolver could be either grouped within a single block, or<br>
divided into two or more blocks, so that arbitrary amount and kind of polymer and/or<br>
solvent could be supplied simultaneously to each block, at a desired supply rate, thereby<br>
effecting dissolution.<br>
As a result, it was found that if the structure and positioning of the support were<br>
such that the polymer flows supplied from each block of holes within the perforated plate<br>
merged and fell together, then even if a stirring mechanism such as a stirring blade was not<br>
provided, the dissolution and/or depolymerization reaction were still accelerated, enabling<br>
the production of the polymer solution and/or solution of a depolymerization product of<br>
the polymer to be achieved quickly and at low cost.<br>
[0035]<br>
A polymer solution produced using the present invention may include an<br><br>
-18-<br>
improver as well as the polymer that is dissolved in the solvent, and this type of improver<br>
can be supplied from a different block from the polymer, discharged from holes within the<br>
perforated plate in the same manner as the thermoplastic polymer, and then blended into<br>
the polymer solution by dissolution as it flows down the support.<br>
Examples of this type of improver include urethane-based resins, epoxy-based<br>
resins, acrylic resins, novolak resins, phenoxy resins, butyral resins, and ketone resins,<br>
and these improvers can be used either alone, or in combinations of two or more different<br>
materials. Furthermore, if required, a plasticizer such as an epoxidized oil or dioctyl<br>
phthalate can also be added. Moreover, other additives including colorants and<br>
stabilizers such as molecular weight reducing agents, colored pigments, anti-sagging<br>
agents, surface conditioners, cross-linking promoting catalysts, ultraviolet absorbers,<br>
photostabilizers, and antioxidants can also be used if required.<br>
[0036]<br>
The polymer supplied from each of the blocks may. of course, be the same<br>
polymer, and by setting the supply rate for each block, the method is able to adapt to<br>
variations in the quantity of polymer being treated.<br>
The distance the thermoplastic polymer flows during the period of contact with<br>
the solvent vapor while flowing down along the surface of the support is preferably at<br>
least 0.5 m. If this fall distance is too short, then the dissolution and/or depolymerization<br>
may be inadequate, meaning the polymer can descend and fall from the end of the support<br>
in an unmodified high viscosity state, and then combine to form aggregates, thereby<br>
dramatically reducing the treatment efficiency.<br>
There are no particular restrictions on the fall distance, although in terms of enhancing the<br>
treatment efficiency, the distance is preferably within a range from 0.5 to 50 m, even more<br>
preferably from 1 to 20 m, and most preferably from 2 to 15 m.<br>
[0037]<br>
(B) Thermoplastic Polymer<br>
Specific examples of the thermoplastic polymer used in the present invention<br><br>
-19-<br>
include polymers with structures in which aliphatic hydrocarbon groups are bonded<br>
together via the bonding of functional groups, such as aliphatic polyesters, aliphatic<br>
polyamides, and aliphatic polycarbonates; polymers with structures in which aliphatic<br>
hydrocarbon groups and aromatic hydrocarbon groups are bonded together via the<br>
bonding of functional groups, such as aliphatic aromatic polyesters, aliphatic aromatic<br>
polyamides, and aliphatic aromatic polycarbonates; and polymers with structures in<br>
which aromatic hydrocarbon groups are bonded together via the bonding of functional<br>
groups, such as aromatic polyesters and aromatic polyamides. Other suitable examples<br>
include thermoplastic polymers such as polyolefin resins, polystyrene resins, acrylic<br>
resins, silicone-based resins, fluororesins, polyphenylene oxides, polyphenylene sulfides,<br>
polysulfones, cellulose-based resins, and chitosan-based resins.<br>
[0038]<br>
The thermoplastic polymers described above may be either homopolymers or<br>
copolymers. Furthermore, copolymers containing different linkages such as ester<br>
linkages, amide linkages and carbonate linkages, and copolymers in which different<br>
skeletons such as polyolefin skeletons, polystyrene skeletons and polyacrylic acid-based<br>
skeletons exist in either random or block-type arrangements are also suitable.<br>
Specific examples of these types of copolymers include polyester carbonates and<br>
polyesteramides.<br>
[0039]<br>
(C) Solvent and Molecular Weight Reducing Agent<br>
The solvent and/or molecular weight reducing agent used in the present<br>
invention may be any compound capable of dissolving and/or effecting a<br>
depolymerization of the thermoplastic polymer. The molecular weight reducing agent<br>
may also function as the solvent. Examples of suitable compounds include one or more<br>
organic solvents such as aliphatic, alicyclic and aromatic hydrocarbon compounds,<br>
aliphatic ester-based compounds, alcohol-based compounds ether-based compounds,<br>
ketone-based compounds, and halogenated hydrocarbon compounds, as well as water and<br><br>
-20-<br>
aqueous solutions produced by mixing an organic compound with water, although this is<br>
in no way an exhaustive list. Of the solvents listed above, organic solvents including<br>
aliphatic hydrocarbons such as hexane and petroleum ether; alicyclic hydrocarbons such<br>
as cyclohexane and cyclohexene; aromatic hydrocarbon compounds such as xylene and<br>
toluene; aliphatic ester-based compounds such as ethyl acetate, propyl acetate, and butyl<br>
acetate; alcohol-based compounds such as methanol, ethanol, butanol, and ethylene<br>
glycol; ether-based compounds such as diethyl ether; ketone-based compounds such as<br>
methyl ethyl ketone, diisobutyl ketone, acetone, and cyclohexanone; and mixtures of<br>
these organic solvents are preferred.<br>
[0040]<br>
Of the various possible molecular weight reducing agents, the molecular weight<br>
reducing agent used for depolymerization of a polycondensation polymer can be selected<br>
from conventional compounds in accordance with the nature of the polycondensation<br>
polymer. Suitable examples include either one compound, or mixtures of two or more<br>
compounds selected from amongst alkylene glycols such as ethylene glycol, propylene<br>
glycol, diethylene glycol, triethylene glycol, tetraethylene glycol, dipropylene glycol, and<br>
tripropylene glycol; alcohols of 1 to 30 carbon atoms including methanol, ethanol,<br>
propanol, butanol, and benzyl alcohol; and water.<br>
[0041]<br>
Furthermore, as well as the molecular weight reducing agent, a<br>
depolymerization catalyst that includes one or more metal compounds selected from a<br>
group consisting of alkali metal carbonates, hydrogen carbonates, hydroxides and<br>
alcoholates, such as sodium carbonate, and alkaline earth metal carbonates, hydrogen<br>
carbonates, hydroxides and alcoholates, and/or a solvent for dissolving or swelling the<br>
polycondensation polymer such as benzene, toluene, xylene, naphthalene,<br>
1-methylnaphthalene, 2-methylnaphthalene, tetralin, isophorone, and<br>
N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone may also be added.<br>
The solvent and/or molecular weight reducing agent are supplied into the inside<br><br>
-21-<br>
of the reactor (the dissolver, depolymerization reactor, or polymerization reactor) in either<br>
a liquid or vapor state, and are brought into contact with the polymer or the like falling<br>
down the support in a vapor state.<br>
[0042]<br>
(D) Dissolver and Dissolution Method<br>
The term "dissolver" used in the present invention refers to a reactor in which a<br>
thermoplastic polymer is supplied, in a melted state, from a raw material supply port to the<br>
interior of the dissolver, and the polymer is discharged through the holes of a perforated<br>
plate and is then caused to make contact with a solvent vapor while flowing down along<br>
the surface of support disposed inside the dissolver.<br>
[0043]<br>
(D-1) Perforated Plate<br>
The term "perforated plate" refers to a plate-type body containing a plurality of<br>
through holes. By using this perforated plate, polymer drift is suppressed and localized<br>
retention within certain sections inside the dissolver is prevented, meaning a polymer<br>
solution and/or solution of a depolymerization product of the polymer can be produced at<br>
higher and more consistent quality. Furthermore, the perforated plate may include either<br>
a single block of holes, or may be divided into two or more blocks, so that arbitrary<br>
polymers and/or solvents can be supplied simultaneously to each block at desired supply<br>
rates.<br>
[0044]<br>
In terms of the construction of the perforated plate, there are no particular<br>
restrictions on the plate thickness, which is typically within a range from 0.1 to 300 mm,<br>
preferably from 1 to 200 mm, and even more preferably from 5 to 150 mm. The<br>
perforated plate must have sufficient strength to withstand the pressure from the supply<br>
chamber housing the polymer to be dissolved, and in those cases where the support within<br>
the dissolution chamber are secured to the perforated plate, must also have sufficient<br>
strength to support the weight of the support, and the polymer and formed polymer<br><br>
-22-<br>
solution falling down the support, meaning perforated plates that have been reinforced<br>
with ribs or the like are one preferred option.<br>
[0045]<br>
The shape of the holes within the perforated plate are usually suitably selected<br>
from shapes including circles, ovals, triangles, slit shapes, polygons, and star shapes.<br>
The cross-sectional area of each hole is typically within a range from 0.01 to 100 cm2,<br>
preferably from 0.05 to 10 cm2 , and even more preferably from 0.1 to 5 cm2 .<br>
Furthermore, a nozzle or the like may also be connected to each of the holes. The shape<br>
and cross-sectional area of the holes can be changed within each block in accordance with<br>
the nature of the material being supplied to that block.<br>
The distance between holes, reported as the distance between hole centers, is<br>
typically from 1 to 500 mm, and preferably from 10 to 100 mm. The holes of the<br>
perforated plate may be through holes that pass through the perforated plate, or may be<br>
formed by the attachment of pipes to the perforated plate. Furthermore, the holes may<br>
also be tapered. The size and shape of the holes are preferably set so that the pressure loss<br>
as the polymer passes through the perforated plate is within a range from 0.1 to 50 kg/cm2.<br>
Furthermore, the arrangement of the holes belonging to each group can be made in<br>
accordance with the desired purpose, and suitable arrangements include positioning the<br>
holes in a random arrangement, positioning the holes in concentric shapes which either<br>
alternate or follow a periodic arrangement in either the radial direction or the<br>
circumferential direction, positioning the holes in an alternating or periodic lattice<br>
arrangement, grouping the holes together for each block, or creating a plurality of groups<br>
within each block.<br>
[0046]<br>
There are no particular restrictions on the number of holes within the perforated<br>
plate, which may vary depending on factors including treatment conditions such as the<br>
dissolution temperature and the pressure, as well as the quantity of solvent, and the<br>
molecular weight range for the polymer undergoing dissolution, although typically, in a<br><br>
-23-<br>
case where 100 kg/hr of polymer is dissolved, the number of holes required is within a<br>
range from 10 to 105, preferably from 50 to 104, and even more preferably from 102 to 103.<br>
Similarly, there are no particular restrictions on the number of blocks, which is typically<br>
within a range from 2 to 100 blocks, although considering problems associated with the<br>
cost of the facilities, is preferably within a range from 2 to 50, and even more preferably<br>
from 2 to 10 blocks.<br>
There are also no particular restrictions on the number of holes within each block,<br>
although a typical number is within a range from 1 to 104, and if processing costs are<br>
considered, the number of holes is preferably within a range from 1 to 103. and even more<br>
preferably from 1 to 10 . The number of holes belonging to each group may be either the<br>
same or different.<br>
The material of the perforated plate is preferably a metal material such as<br>
stainless steel, carbon steel, hastelloy, nickel, titanium, chrome, or another alloy.<br>
[0047]<br>
Examples of suitable methods of discharging the polymer through the type of<br>
perforated plate described above include methods in which the polymer is dripped from a<br>
liquid head or under its own weight, or methods in which a pump or the like is used to<br>
pressurize and force out the polymer. In order to suppress variations in the quantity of<br>
polymer flowing down through the reactor, force feeding the polymer using a pump with<br>
a measuring function such as a gear pump is preferred.<br>
A filter is preferably provided in a position within the flow path that is upstream<br>
from the perforated plate.By employing a filter, impurities likely to cause blockages of the<br>
perforated plate holes can be removed. The type of filter used is selected so that<br>
impurities of sizes equal to or exceeding the hole diameter of the holes within the<br>
perforated plate can be removed, while the filter itself is undamaged by the passage of the<br>
polymer.<br>
[0048]<br>
(D-2) Support(s)<br><br>
-24-<br>
The polymer discharged from the perforated plate holes flows down along<br>
support. The polymer discharged from the perforated plate holes flows down along the<br>
support. Examples of specific structures for the support include wire-type structure,<br>
chain or lattice-type (wire mesh-type) structure in which a wire material has been linked<br>
together, three dimensional lattice structure in which a wire material has been interlinked<br>
in a so-called jungle-gym type structure, thin plate-type structure which may be either flat<br>
or curved, and perforated plate-type structure. In addition, in order to increase the contact<br>
surface area between the polymer and the solvent and/or molecular weight reducing agent,<br>
and enable efficient extraction of impurities dissolved within the polymer and impurities<br>
generated through thermal degradation within the solution, the polymer is preferably<br>
caused to flow down along support which contain indentations or irregularities that<br>
oppose the downward flow direction of the polymer, thereby actively initiating mixing<br>
and surface renewal within the polymer flow. Support such as wire-type structure with<br>
irregularities that oppose the downward flow direction of the polymer, thereby hindering<br>
the downward flow of the polymer, are also preferred. Using combinations of these types<br>
of supports, and positioning different supports in different locations in accordance with<br>
the nature of the material supplied from each of the perforated plate blocks is also<br>
desirable. Furthermore, depending on the purpose of the treatment, the supports may be<br>
positioned so that the material flows supplied from each of the blocks do not merge on the<br>
supports, or may also be positioned so that the material flows do merge on the supports.<br>
[0049]<br>
A wire-type support refers to a material in which the ratio of the length in a<br>
direction perpendicular to a cross-section, relative to the average length around the outer<br>
circumference of that cross-section, is extremely large. There are no particular<br>
restrictions on the surface area of the cross-section, but typically, the surface area is within<br>
a range from 10-3 to 102 cm2, and is preferably from 10-3 to 101 cm2, and even more<br>
preferably from 10-2 to 1 cm2. There are also no particular restrictions on the shape of this<br>
cross-section, which is typically selected from shapes including circles, ovals, triangles,<br><br>
-25-<br>
squares, polygons, and star shapes and the like. The cross-sectional shape may stay the<br>
same throughout the length of the support, but may also vary.<br>
Furthermore, the wire may also be hollow. The term "wire" includes both single wire<br>
strands, as well as materials in which a plurality of wire strands are combined by a method<br>
such as twisting the wires together. The surface of the wire may be smooth, may include<br>
indentations, or may be partially covered with protrusions or the like.<br>
[0050]<br>
A chain-type support refers to a material in which rings formed using a wire<br>
material described above have been interlinked. The shape of these rings may be circular,<br>
oval, rectangular, or square or the like. The interlinking of these rings may be one<br>
dimensional, two dimensional or three dimensional.<br>
[0051]<br>
A lattice-type (wire mesh-type) structure refers to a material in which a wire<br>
material described above has been linked together in a lattice-type arrangement. The<br>
wire may be either straight or curved, and the angles involved in the linking can be<br>
selected as desired. There are no particular restrictions on the surface area ratio between<br>
solid material and space when the lattice-type (wire mesh-type) material is viewed from a<br>
direction perpendicular to the surface of the lattice, but the ratio is typically within a range<br>
from 1:0.5 to 1:1,000, preferably from 1:1 to 1:500, and even more preferably from 1:5 to<br>
1:100. This surface area ratio is preferably equal across the horizontal direction, whereas<br>
in the vertical direction, the surface area ratio is preferably either equal, or shifts to a larger<br>
proportion of space towards the lower portions of the support.<br>
[0052]<br>
A three dimensional lattice-type structure refers to a material in which a wire<br>
material has been linked together in a three dimensional lattice similar to a so-called<br>
jungle gym. The wire may be either straight or curved, and the angles involved in the<br>
linking can be selected as desired.<br>
[0053]<br><br>
-26-<br>
A wire-type support with irregularities within the downward flow direction of<br>
the polymer refers either to a structure in which rod-like objects with a circular<br>
cross-section or a polygonal cross-section are attached at right angles to the wire, or to a<br>
structure in which circular discs or circular cylindrical objects are attached to the wire.<br>
The level difference provided by these irregularities is preferably at least 5 mm.<br>
Specific examples of the support include circular disc-fitted wires in which a wire is<br>
passed through the center of a series of circular discs of thickness 1 to 50 mm, which have<br>
a diameter that is at least 5 mm larger than the wire diameter but is no more than 100 mm,<br>
and the spacing between the circular discs is set to value within a range from 1 to 500 mm.<br>
[0054]<br>
Although there are no particular restrictions on the ratio between the volume of<br>
the support disposed inside the dissolver and the internal volume of the dissolver, the ratio<br>
is typically within a range from 1:0.5 to 1:107, and is preferably from 1:10 to 1:106, and<br>
even more preferably from 1:50 to 1:105. The ratio (support volume : internal volume of<br>
the dissolver) is preferably equal across the horizontal direction, whereas in the vertical<br>
direction, the ratio is preferably either equal, or shifts to a larger proportion for the internal<br>
volume of the dissolver towards the lower portions of the support.<br>
[0055]<br>
Depending on the shape of the support, either a single support or a plurality of<br>
supports may be provided. In the case of wire-type or chain-type support, the number of<br>
support is typically within a range from 1 to 105, and preferably from 3 to 104. In the case<br>
of lattice-type support, two dimensionally linked chain-type support, thin-plate type<br>
support, and perforated plate-type support, the number of support is typically within a<br>
range from 1 to 104, and preferably from 2 to 103. In the case of a three dimensionally<br>
linked chain-type support or a three dimensional lattice-type support, the decision as to<br>
whether to use a single support, or to divide the support and provide a plurality of support,<br>
can be made with due consideration of factors such as the size of the reactor and the space<br>
available for installing the support.<br><br>
-27-<br>
In those cases where a plurality of supports are provided, spacers or the like are<br>
preferably used to ensure that the supports do not contact each other.<br>
[0056]<br>
Although there are no particular restrictions on the material used for forming the<br>
support, the material is typically selected from amongst stainless steel, carbon steel,<br>
hastelloy, and titanium and the like. Furthermore, if required, the wire may also be<br>
subjected to any of a variety of surface treatments such as plating, lining, passivity<br>
treatment. or acid washing.	<br>
[0057]<br>
In the present invention, usually, the polymer is supplied from one or more<br>
perforated plate holes to each support, although the number of holes can be selected<br>
appropriately in accordance with the shape of the support. Furthermore, causing the<br>
polymer that has been discharged through a single hole to flow down a plurality of<br>
supports is also possible. Moreover, depending on the purpose of the treatment, the<br>
polymer can be supplied from the holes of a plurality of perforated plate blocks to a single<br>
support, or can also be supplied from the holes of a single block to one or more supports.<br>
There are no particular restrictions on the positioning of the support, provided<br>
the thermoplastic polymer is able to flow down along the support. Suitable methods for<br>
attaching the support to the perforated plate include passing the support through the<br>
perforated plate holes, and fixing the support beneath the perforated plate holes.<br>
Although there are no particular restrictions on the length of the support, in order<br>
to increase the efficiency of the treatment the length is preferably within a range from 0.5<br>
to 50 m, even more preferably from 1 to 20 m, and most preferably from 2 to 15 m.<br>
[0058]<br>
In the present invention, because a method is employed in which the<br>
thermoplastic polymer flows down the surface of the support, the surface area of the<br>
surface layer of the of the thermoplastic polymer can be increased significantly.<br>
In other words, when S1 and S2 satisfy the relationship that S1/S2 &gt; 1 where S1 is the<br><br>
-28-<br>
surface area of the thermoplastic polymer flowing down along the support and S2 is the<br>
contact area between the support and the polymer, the thermoplastic polymer readily<br>
reacts with the solvent, which leads to the efficient proceeding of the dissolution. In<br>
addition, the number of supports can be increased to enhance the amount of treatment.<br>
[0059]<br>
Here, S1 is the surface area of the flowing-down thermoplastic polymer, and S2<br>
is the contact area between the support and the polymer. In contrast, cases in which<br>
S1/S2 = 
walls of a wetted-wall column, and in these cases, not only does the treatment capability<br>
per unit volume of the dissolver decrease markedly, but the downward polymer flows can<br>
merge and form aggregates, causing an additional deterioration in the efficiency of the<br>
dissolution process.<br>
[0060]<br>
In the present invention, because a method is employed in which the<br>
thermoplastic polymer that is distributed to each of the supports by the perforated plate<br>
flows down the surface of the corresponding supports while being retained on that<br>
supports, the contact surface area between the thermoplastic polymer and the solvent<br>
vapor, and the mixing effect realized by the downward flow of the polymer can both be<br>
increased dramatically, and the polymers retained on each of the supports cannot merge to<br>
form aggregates, meaning the dissolution efficiency is extremely high.<br>
[0061]<br>
(D-3) Solvent Supply Device<br>
Possible methods that can be employed in those cases where a solvent is<br>
supplied to the inside of the dissolver include (1) methods in which, as described above,<br>
the holes of the perforated plate are divided into two or more blocks, and arbitrary<br>
polymers and/or solvents are supplied simultaneously to each block at desired supply<br>
rates to effect dissolution, (2) methods in which the solvent is absorbed by, or incorporated<br>
into the thermoplastic polymer in advance, and this mixture is then supplied to the<br><br>
-29-<br>
dissolver to effect dissolution, (3) methods in which the solvent is introduced directly into<br>
the main body of the dissolver, as well as suitable combinations of these methods.<br>
In those cases where the solvent is introduced directly into the main body of the<br>
dissolver, supply of the solvent can be conducted through an inlet positioned at a desired<br>
location in the dissolver. The position of the solvent inlet may be within either the liquid<br>
phase region at the bottom of the dissolver, or the gas phase region that sits above the<br>
liquid phase region at the bottom of the dissolver. If introduction of the solvent occurs<br>
within the gas phase region, then the inlet is preferably separated from the venting ports.<br>
[0062]<br>
(D-4) Temperature and Pressure<br>
The dissolution temperature can be set to an appropriate level by controlling the<br>
temperature of a heater or heating jacket disposed either within the side walls of, or within<br>
the interior of, the dissolver that encloses the support, or by providing a heater or heating<br>
medium inside the support and then controlling the temperature of this heater or medium.<br>
The pressure inside the dissolver can be set to an appropriate level by connecting<br>
the dissolver to either a pressurization device or a pressure reduction device.<br>
The temperature and pressure during dissolution and/or depolymerization are<br>
preferably selected in accordance with the nature of the thermoplastic polymer<br>
undergoing treatment, the solvent, and/or the molecular weight reducing agent.<br>
[0063]<br>
For example, the temperature is preferably set so that, under the treatment<br>
pressure being used, the atmospheric temperature inside the dissolver is either equal to, or<br>
higher than, the boiling point of at least one of the components of the solvent. By setting<br>
the temperature in this manner, even a small quantity of solvent can be used to generate an<br>
adequate quantity of solvent vapor inside the dissolver, enabling the dissolution process to<br>
proceed with favorable efficiency. The solvent vapor is absorbed by the polymer retained<br>
on the support, causing the polymer to swell, and also generates a low viscosity polymer<br>
solution which flows down along the support, so that a portion of the solvent generates the<br><br>
-30-<br>
polymer solution that is extracted from the dissolver, whereas another portion returns to<br>
vapor form inside the dissolver and dissolves more polymer.<br>
The solvent does not only act in vapor form, and a portion also condenses within the upper<br>
regions of the dissolver, and then flows down the support in liquid form.<br>
[0064]<br>
On the other hand, in order to ensure the efficient production of a high quantity<br>
polymer, the temperature is preferably equal to, or higher than, either the glass transition<br>
temperature of the thermoplastic polymer undergoing treatment, or the temperature at<br>
which the polymer undergoes crystallization. Moreover, the temperature is preferably set<br>
to a high value, but must be kept below the temperature at which the polymer undergoes<br>
thermal degradation.<br>
In order to ensure conditions suitable for generating the solvent vapor, as well as<br>
conditions suited to the thermoplastic polymer undergoing treatment (namely, a<br>
temperature that is equal to, or higher than, the glass transition temperature or the polymer<br>
crystallization temperature, but no higher than the temperature at which thermal<br>
degradation of the polymer becomes significant), the treatment pressure is preferably<br>
selected from amongst normal pressure, applied pressure, or reduced pressure in<br>
accordance with the properties of the solvent being used.<br>
Furthermore, under applied pressure or reduced pressure conditions, one<br>
preferred method involves introducing an inert gas that exerts no deleterious effects on the<br>
dissolution and/or depolymerization treatment into the dissolver, so that oxygen dissolved<br>
within the thermoplastic polymer and/or impurities generated during the<br>
depolymerization process can be flushed out of the dissolver together with the inert gas.<br>
Especially, in order to suppress polymer degradation, enabling the production of a<br>
solution of superior quality, and also prevent contamination of the dissolver (or the<br>
depolymerization reactor), the oxygen concentration within the gas phase portion inside<br>
the dissolver is preferably no more than 5% by volume.<br>
[0065]<br><br>
-31-<br>
In a surprising finding, investigations by the inventors of the present invention<br>
revealed that introduction of an inert gas into the dissolver actually improves the fluidity<br>
of the melted thermoplastic polymer flowing down the support, and particularly in those<br>
cases where treatment is conducted under reduced pressure, the polymer undergoes<br>
foaming, thereby dramatically increasing the surface area and significantly improving the<br>
renewal process of the polymer surface layer, which enables the dissolution and/or<br>
depolymerization to proceed in an extremely short period of time. The reasons for these<br>
findings are not entirely clear, although it is surmised that the changes in the interior and<br>
surface states of the thermoplastic polymer are responsible for the dramatic increase in the<br>
treatment speed.<br>
[0066]<br>
The inert gas introduced into the system preferably has no deleterious effects on<br>
the resin such as coloration, transformation, or decomposition, and suitable examples<br>
include nitrogen, argon, helium, carbon dioxide, lower hydrocarbon gases, and mixtures<br>
thereof. Nitrogen, argon, helium, or carbon dioxide are preferred as the inert gas, and of<br>
these, in terms of ease of availability, nitrogen is particularly desirable.<br>
The quantity of inert gas introduced in the present invention is preferably within<br>
a range from 0.05 to 100 mg per 1 g of the polymer supplied to the dissolver. By ensuring<br>
that the quantity of the inert gas is at least 0.05 mg per 1 g of the polymer undergoing<br>
extraction, satisfactory foaming of the resin is achieved, and the treatment effects<br>
described above can be enhanced. On the other hand, restricting the inert gas quantity to<br>
no more than 100 mg facilitates pressure reduction. The quantity of the inert gas is even<br>
more preferably within a range from 0.1 to 50 mg, and most preferably from 0.2 to 10 mg,<br>
per 1 g of the extracted polymer.<br>
[0067]<br>
Suitable methods of introducing the inert gas include methods in which the gas is<br>
introduced directly into the dissolver, methods in which the inert gas is absorbed or<br>
incorporated into the thermoplastic polymer in advance, and this absorbed and/or<br><br>
-32-<br>
incorporated gas is then released from the thermoplastic polymer under reduced pressure<br>
and thus introduced into the dissolver, and combinations of these methods. Here, the<br>
term "absorbed" refers to the case in which the inert gas is dissolved within the polymer<br>
and does not exist as gas bubbles, whereas the term "incorporated" means the gas exists as<br>
bubbles within the polymer. In those cases when the inert gas exists as gas bubbles, the<br>
size of these bubbles is preferably as small as possible, and the average gas bubble<br>
diameter is preferably no more than 5 mm, and even more preferably 2 mm or smaller.<br>
[0068]<br>
(D-5) Treatment Time<br>
The treatment time refers to the combined total of the time required for the<br>
thermoplastic polymer to flow down the support and the time the polymer is retained in<br>
the bottom of the dissolver, and is preferably within a range from 10 seconds to 100 hours,<br>
even more preferably from 1 minute to 10 hours, even more preferably from 5 minutes to<br>
5 hours, and most preferably from 20 minutes to 3 hours.<br>
[0069]<br>
(D-6) Dissolution Capability<br>
In the case of wire-type support, the dissolution capability of the dissolver of the<br>
present invention increases in proportion to the number of supports, offering the<br>
advantage that scaling up the design is relatively simple.<br>
In the case of wire-type support, the flow rate of thermoplastic polymer for each<br>
support is preferably within a range from 10-2 to 102 liters/hour. By ensuring the flow rate<br>
falls within this range, a satisfactory treatment capability can be achieved, and the<br>
dissolution rate can be increased dramatically. Flow rates within a range from 0.1 to 50<br>
liters/hour are even more desirable.<br>
[0070]<br>
In the case of support such as lattice-type (wire mesh-type) support. where wire<br>
sections are interlinked, the polymer flow rate is preferably within a range from 10-2 to 102<br>
liters/hour, and even more preferably from 0.1 to 50 liters/hour, for each vertical wire<br><br>
-33-<br>
structure within the support.<br>
In the case of support such as thin plate-type support which do not employ wire<br>
structures, the flow rate is preferably within a range from 10-2 to 102 liters/hour, and even<br>
more preferably from 0.1 to 50 liters/hour, per perforated plate hole that supplies polymer<br>
to the support.<br>
[0071]<br>
Using PET as an example, as follows is a description of the method of producing<br>
a thermoplastic polymer solution from a thermoplastic polymer using the dissolver of the<br>
present invention, based on the drawings.<br>
In FIG. 1, a PET resin is supplied to a dissolver 10 via a raw material supply port<br>
2 using a feed pump (A) 1, and this resin passes through the holes within a block A on a<br>
perforated plate 3, enters the dissolver 10, and then flows down supports 5. On the other<br>
hand, a solvent is supplied using a feed pump (B) 1, and also flows down along the<br>
supports 5.<br>
[0072]<br>
Blocks have been provided in the example shown in the figure, but these blocks<br>
may also be treated as a single block, and PET and the solvent can then be supplied<br>
simultaneously to this single block. Alternatively, the solvent can also be supplied<br>
directly to the dissolver, without passing through the feed pump 1 or the perforated plate 3,<br>
via an inlet positioned in an arbitrary location in the dissolver main body. The position of<br>
this solvent inlet may be within either the liquid phase region at the bottom of the dissolver,<br>
or the gas phase region that sits above the liquid phase region at the bottom of the<br>
dissolver.<br>
The polymer solution obtained by the dissolution of the PET resin in the solvent<br>
is discharged from a discharge port 9 using a drainage pump 8.<br>
[0073]<br>
After falling to the lower portion of the dissolver, the polymer solution is<br>
extracted from the discharge port using the drainage pump, but during this process, the<br><br>
-34-<br>
quantity of solution accumulated in the lower portion of the dissolver is preferably kept as<br>
constant as possible. One example of a method of controlling the quantity of<br>
accumulated solution involves inspecting the quantity of solution through an observation<br>
window, or using a level meter such as a capacitance meter to monitor the quantity of<br>
accumulated solution, and then adjusting the flow rates through the feed pumps and the<br>
drainage pump accordingly.<br>
The feed pumps, the dissolver main body, the drainage pump, and the transport<br>
piping and the like are heated and insulated using a heater or a jacket.<br>
[0074]<br>
In the example shown in the figure, a pressure reduction pipe is provided in the<br>
dissolver main body as a pressure reduction exhaust port 7. In the case of PET resin,<br>
which has a melting point of approximately 255°C and undergoes marked thermal<br>
decomposition at temperatures of 280°C or higher, in order to ensure that the boiling point<br>
of the solvent used falls within this temperature range, either the pressure inside the<br>
dissolver can be adjusted to an appropriate reduced pressure state, or alternatively, the<br>
dissolver can be connected to a pressurization device, and the pressure inside the dissolver<br>
adjusted to an appropriate pressurized state.<br>
Dissolution can be conducted using either a single dissolver or two or more<br>
dissolvers.<br>
[0075]<br>
The steps required for producing the polymer solution from the raw materials<br>
can be conducted using a batch-type operation or using a continuous operation.<br>
In the case of a batch operation, the entire quantities of the raw materials and other<br>
reactants are supplied to the dissolver, and following reaction for a predetermined period,<br>
the entire reaction product is transferred to the next dissolver. In contrast, in the case of a<br>
continuous operation, the raw materials and reactants are supplied continuously to each of<br>
the dissolvers, and the dissolved product is discharged continuously.<br>
In order to produce large quantities of a polymer solution of uniform quality, a continuous<br><br>
-35-<br>
operation is preferred.<br>
[0076]<br>
FIG. 2 is a specific example of a method of supplying a polymer, and a solvent or<br>
an improver to each block of the perforated plate 3.<br>
FIG 2 shows an example in which either one or a plurality of different polymers,<br>
and one or more solvents or improvers are supplied from each block of the perforated<br>
plate. As shown in the figure, the supply rate for each of the supplied materials is set<br>
separately for each block (A to D) of the perforated plate by using a series of mutually<br>
independent feed pumps (A to D), thereby enabling the production of a polymer solution<br>
with any arbitrary composition.<br>
The supply rate for each block (A to D) of the perforated plate can be changed as<br>
desired during the dissolution operation, meaning small quantities of a large variety of<br>
polymer solutions can be produced cheaply and at high quality.<br>
[0077]<br>
(E) Depolymerization Reactor and Depolymerization Method<br>
The term "depolymerization reactor" used in the present invention refers to a<br>
reactor in which a thermoplastic polymer is supplied, in a melted state, from a raw-<br>
material supply port to the interior of the depolymerization reactor, and the polymer is<br>
then discharged through the holes of a perforated plate and subsequently depolymerized<br>
through contact with the vapor of a molecular weight reducing agent, while flowing down<br>
along the surface of support disposed inside the depolymerization reactor, thereby<br>
producing a depolymerization product and/or a solution of a depolymerization product.<br>
With the exception of the requirement to use a molecular weight reducing agent,<br>
the structure of a depolymerization reactor of the present invention and the associated<br>
depolymerization method can simply employ the method described above in section (D)<br>
relating to the dissolver and dissolution method.<br>
[0078]<br>
The product obtained using the dissolution method and/or depolymerization<br><br>
-36-<br>
method of the present invention can be subjected to further purification and then reused as<br>
a polymer raw material. For example, in the case of a polyolefin resin, the resin isolated<br>
and recovered from the solution can be used for material recycling, and in the case of a<br>
PET resin, the depolymerization product can be subjected to a transesterification reaction<br>
by adding MeOH to produce dimethyl terephthalate (DMT), and the purified DMT can<br>
then be chemically recycled and used as the raw material for a polycondensation reaction.<br>
[0079]<br>
During the transesterification reaction, the reaction temperature is preferably in<br>
the range from 50 to 150°C, and the reaction pressure is preferably in the range from 0.0<br>
to 0.59 MPa. When the temperature and pressure are within these ranges, the<br>
transesterification reaction proceeds sufficiently. The transesterification reaction time is<br>
preferably 30 minutes to 4 hours.<br>
The transesterification catalyst here used may be a conventional known<br>
transesterification catalyst; however, at least one compound selected from the group<br>
consisting of carbonates, hydrogen carbonates and carboxylates of alkali metals and alkali<br>
earth metals is preferably used in terms of high catalytic activity. Sodium carbonate is<br>
most preferably used.<br>
[0080]<br>
The mixture obtained from the transesterification reaction contains DMT,<br>
MeOH, EG monomers derived from copolyesters, as well as by-products of the EG<br>
depolymerization reaction and the transesterification reaction such as water, dioxane, and<br>
dimethyl ether.<br>
A recrystallization operation is performed using the mixture per se, or when the<br>
crystal of DMT does not completely dissolve, the mixture is heated and the copolymer<br>
composition is dissolved in the mixed solution. Here, the mixture is once heated at the<br>
transesterification reaction temperature, or at a temperature within the range from 60 to<br>
150°C depending on the composition of the mixture before dissolving impurities such as<br>
the monomers derived from copolyesters in the solution, and is then cooled to a<br><br>
-37-<br>
temperature within the range from 10 to 50°C. If necessary, the latent heat of the solvent<br>
is preferably used to cool the mixture.<br>
[0081]<br>
The DMT concentration within the mixed solution is preferably within a range<br>
from 10 to 40% by weight. If the concentration of DMT is less than 10% by weight, then<br>
the quantity of solvent used increases, which is undesirable from an economic viewpoint.<br>
In contrast, if the concentration exceeds 40% by weight, the removal of impurities<br>
becomes unsatisfactory.<br>
The mixture subjected to a recrystalization operation undergoes to solid-liquid<br>
separation by a centrifugal separation operation or the like, followed by adding MeOH to<br>
the resultant cake for the washing thereof.<br>
Here, the amount of MeOH added is preferably in the range from 1- to 5-fold<br>
that of DMT. An amount within this range makes the removal of impurities sufficient,<br>
which is also desirable from an economic viewpoint.<br>
The washing with MeOH is preferably performed on the order of 1 to 3 times,<br>
on under known conditions and recovered as high-purity DMT.<br>
However, when the removal of impurities is insufficient depending on the amount of<br>
monomers derived from copolyesters, the number of the washings may be further<br>
increased. The MeOH-washed DMT is then subjected to distillation purification under<br>
known conditions and recovered as high-purity DMT.<br>
[0082]<br>
The thus obtained high-purity DMT can then be subjected to a transesterification<br>
reaction under normal pressure and with no catalyst, by heating to 180 to 250°C with a<br>
large excess of EG equivalent to at least 2 mols of EG for each mol of DMT, thereby<br>
producing bis(hydroxyethyl) terephthalate (BHET), which is a polymerization<br>
intermediate for PET resins. DMT and EG form an equilibrium state under constant<br>
heating even without the use of a catalyst, and by using a large excess of EG the balance<br>
can be shifted considerably towards the BHET side of the equilibrium.<br><br>
-38-<br>
The amount of EG used in the reaction is preferably on the order of 2 to 30 times by mole,<br>
particularly preferably 4 to 10 times by mole that of DMT. Furthermore, the MeOH<br>
generated as a by-product of the transesterification reaction must be effectively removed<br>
from the system, but EG and DMT are also removed during distillation of the MeOH,<br>
meaning a minimum of at least two fractionating columns are preferably provided, and<br>
considerable importance must also be placed on the temperature control for each of those<br>
fractionating columns.<br>
[0083]<br>
By conducting these steps, purified DMT is converted to a linear lower oligomer<br>
with a molecular weight of 254 to 1,300 containing BHET as the primary component, and<br>
this product can be collected as an intermediate raw material for high quality polyester<br>
products. Because the transesterification reaction is conducted under normal pressure<br>
and with no catalyst, a period of approximately 4 to 10 hours is required for the reaction to<br>
proceed to completion, but because the reaction proceeds slowly with no catalyst present,<br>
the generation of by-products such as diethylene glycol is minimized.<br>
[0084]<br>
Using the depolymerization of PET as an example, as follows is a description of<br>
a preferred example of the present invention, based on the drawings.<br>
FIG. 3 onwards show configurations that represent preferred combinations for<br>
realizing the method of the present invention, but the present invention is in no way<br>
restricted by these examples.<br>
In FIG. 3, a PET resin is supplied to a depolymerization reactor via the raw<br>
material supply port 2 using the feed pump (A) 1, whereas a molecular weight reducing<br>
agent is supplied to the depolymerization reactor via the raw material supply port 2 using<br>
the feed pump (B) 1. These raw materials pass through the holes within a block A and a<br>
block B respectively on the perforated plate 3, enter the inside of the depolymerization<br>
reactor, and then flow down the supports 5. By appropriate positioning of the blocks of<br>
the perforated plate and the supports, the respective flows of these supplied raw materials<br><br>
-39-<br>
merge on the supports, thus causing the depolymerization reaction to proceed.<br>
[0085]<br>
Blocks have been provided in the example shown in the figure, but these blocks<br>
may also be treated as a single block, and PET and the molecular weight reducing agent<br>
can then be supplied simultaneously to this single block. Alternatively, the molecular<br>
weight reducing agent may be also supplied through an inlet formed in any location in the<br>
depolymerization reactor body not via transfer pump 1 and perforated plate 3. Here, the<br>
location of the inlet for the molecular weight reducing agent may be within the liquid<br>
phase region at the bottom of the depolymerization reactor or within the vapor phase<br>
region that sits above the liquid phase region at the bottom of the depolymerization<br>
reactor.<br>
[0086]<br>
In the example shown in the figure, a pressure reduction pipe is provided in the<br>
main body of the dissolver as the pressure reduction exhaust port 7. In the case of PET<br>
resin, which has a melting point of approximately 255°C and undergoes marked thermal<br>
decomposition at temperatures of 280°C or higher, in order to ensure that the boiling point<br>
of the molecular weight reducing agent used falls within this temperature range, either the<br>
pressure inside the dissolver can be adjusted to an appropriate reduced pressure state, or<br>
alternatively, the dissolver can be connected to a pressurization device, and the pressure<br>
inside the dissolver adjusted to an appropriate pressurized state.<br>
[0087]<br>
The product obtained by the depolymerization is allowed to flow down to the<br>
lower portion of the depolymerization reactor and then extracted through the discharge<br>
port using the drainage pump; here, the amount of the product accumulated in the lower<br>
portion of the depolymerization reactor is preferably made as constant as possible.<br>
One example of a method of controlling the quantity of accumulated product involves<br>
inspecting the quantity of product through an observation window, or using a level meter<br>
such as a capacitance meter to monitor the quantity of product, and then adjusting the flow<br><br>
-40-<br>
rates through the feed pumps and the drainage pump accordingly.<br>
The feed pumps, the depolymerization reactor main body, the drainage pump,<br>
and the transport piping and the like are heated and insulated using a heater or a jacket.<br>
[0088]<br>
The depolymerization reactor used in the present invention may have a stirrer or<br>
the like fitted within the bottom of the depolymerization reactor, although such a stirrer is<br>
not particularly necessary. Accordingly, the rotational drive section can be removed from<br>
the main body of the depolymerization reactor, enabling depolymerization to be<br>
conducted under favorably sealed conditions, even when the system is placed under high<br>
vacuum. Because the rotational drive section of the drainage pump is covered by the<br>
depolymerization product waiting to be discharged, the sealing properties are vastly<br>
superior to cases in which a rotational drive section is fitted to the main body of the<br>
depolymerization reactor.<br>
The method of the present invention can be conducted using either a single<br>
depolymerization reactor or two or more depolymerization reactors.<br>
[0089]<br>
The steps required for depolymerizing the PET can be conducted using a<br>
batch-type operation or using a continuous operation. In the case of a batch operation, the<br>
entire quantities of the raw materials and other reactants are supplied to the reactor, and<br>
following reaction for a predetermined period, the entire reaction product is transferred to<br>
the next reactor. In contrast, in the case of a continuous operation, the raw materials and<br>
reactants are supplied continuously to each of the reactors, and the reaction product can be<br>
discharged continuously.<br>
[0090]<br>
FIG. 4 and FIG. 5 show specific examples of methods of supplying various PET<br>
resins and molecular weight reducing agents to each block of the perforated plate 3.<br>
FIG. 4 shows an example in which a single polycondensation polymer is<br>
supplied from each block of the perforated plate. When the supply rate of the<br><br>
-41-<br>
polycondensation polymer is made capable of being separately set for each block (A to D)<br>
of the perforated plate using an each independent transfer pump (A to D), it is possible to<br>
adapt to variations in the treatment amount without significantly changing reaction<br>
conditions for the depolymerization reactor by supplying the polymer only from any one<br>
of the blocks.<br>
[0091]<br>
FIG. 5 shows an example in which a single polycondensation polymer or a<br>
plurality of polycondensation polymers and/or one or more molecular weight reducing<br>
agents are supplied from each block of the perforated plate. As shown in the figure, the<br>
supply rate of each supply material can be separately set for each block (A to D) of the<br>
perforated plate using an each independent transfer pump (A to D) to depolymerize a<br>
copolymerized polymer having any composition using a molecular weight reducing agent<br>
having any composition.<br>
In both examples, the supply rate to each of the blocks (A to D) of the perforated<br>
plate can be altered as desired while the depolymerization is in progress, meaning small<br>
quantities of a large variety of polymers can be subjected to the depolymerization process.<br>
[0092]<br>
FIG 6 shows a specific example of a depolymerization reactor that realizes the<br>
method of the present invention for the case in which an inert gas absorption device is<br>
used. PET is supplied from a raw material supply port N2 to an inert gas absorption<br>
device N10 using a feed pump Nl, passes through a perforated plate N3 and enters the<br>
interior of the inert gas absorption device, and then flows down along a series of supports<br>
N5. The inside of the inert gas absorption device is controlled at a predetermined<br>
pressure via a pressure reduction exhaust port N7, and the PET absorbs an inert gas such<br>
as nitrogen introduced from an inert gas supply port N6 while flowing down the supports.<br>
Using a drainage-feed pump N8, the PET is then supplied through the raw material supply<br>
port 2 and into the depolymerization reactor 10, passes through a block A of the perforated<br>
plate 3, enters the inside of the depolymerization reactor, and then flow down along the<br><br>
-42-<br>
supports 5.<br>
[0093]<br>
At this point, a molecular weight reducing agent can be supplied simultaneously<br>
to a block B of the perforated plate 3 using the feed pump (B) 1. Instead of supplying the<br>
molecular weight reducing agent to the perforated plate 3 of the depolymerization reactor<br>
10, a block A and a block B may be provided on the perforated plate N3 of the inert gas<br>
absorption device N10, and the feed pump (B) 1 then used to supply the molecular weight<br>
reducing agent to the block B of the perforated plate N3. Alternatively, as previously<br>
described in Figure 1, there may be also provided a single block, to which PET and the<br>
molecular weight reducing agent are supplied simultaneously. Alternatively, the<br>
molecular weight reducing agent may be also supplied through an inlet formed in any<br>
location in the body of depolymerization reactor 10 not via transfer pump (B) 1 and<br>
perforated plate 3. Here, the location of the inlet for the molecular weight reducing agent<br>
may be within the liquid phase region at the bottom of the depolymerization reactor or<br>
within the vapor phase region that sits above the liquid phase region at the bottom of the<br>
depolymerization reactor.<br>
[0094]<br>
In the example shown in the figure, a pressure reduction pipe is provided in the<br>
main body of the dissolver as the pressure reduction exhaust port 7. In the case of PET<br>
resin, which has a melting point of approximately 255°C and undergoes marked thermal<br>
decomposition at temperatures of 280°C or higher, in order to ensure that the boiling point<br>
of the molecular weight reducing agent used falls within this temperature range, either the<br>
pressure inside the dissolver can be adjusted to an appropriate reduced pressure state, or<br>
alternatively, the dissolver can be connected to a pressurization device, and the pressure<br>
inside the dissolver adjusted to an appropriate pressurized state. The depolymerization<br>

(F) Polymerization Reactor Suited to a Cleaning Method of the Present Invention, and a<br>
Method of Cleaning such a Reactor<br>
(F-l) Polymerization Reactor Principles<br>
A polymerization method used within a polymerization reactor suited to a<br>
cleaning method of the present invention is a method wherein a polymerization<br>
intermediate for a polymer capable of being polymerized by a melt polycondensation<br>
reaction is supplied, in a melted state, from a raw material supply port to a polymerization<br>
reactor, is discharged through the holes of a perforated plate, and then undergoes<br>
polymerization under reduced pressure, while flowing down along the surface of support<br>
under the effects of gravity.<br>
[0096]	<br><br>
As described below, when appropriate conditions are satisfied by the<br>
characteristics of the polymerization intermediate, the structure of the polymerization<br>
reactor, and the polymerization method, the polymerization intermediate flowing down<br>
along the support becomes a state containing a large amount of foam; as the<br>
polymerization proceeds, the polymer forms a foam ball (aggregate) type structure and<br>
tumbles down towards the bottom of the polymerization reactor, thereby exhibiting a<br>
behavior of rapid movement.<br>
As a result, the method of the present invention has the advantages that the<br>
contact surface area between the polymer and the vapor phase and the polymer mixing<br>
effect are dramatically increased; by-products from the polycondensation reaction<br>
(ethylene glycol in the case of PET) and impurities generated by thermal decomposition<br>
during polymerization (acetaldehyde in the case of PET) can be effectively removed from<br>
the polymerization intermediate; the polymerization rate can be increased markedly; and<br>
a high-quality polymer with minimal residual impurities can be produced.<br>
[0097]<br><br>
-44-<br>
Consequently, the method of the present invention has the merits that the<br>
polymerization rate is dramatically increased compared to conventional melt<br>
polymerization techniques; and a high-quality polymer with minimal residual impurities<br>
can be produced at a polymerization temperature far lower than that attainable using<br>
conventional known polymerization reactores.<br>
During further studies, the present inventors have found that the holes of a<br>
perforated plate in the polymerization reactor can be grouped within a single block or<br>
grouped into two or more blocks, so that the polymerization can also be conducted by<br>
supplying any polymerization intermediates and/or polymer modifier simultaneously to<br>
each block at any supply rate.<br>
[0098]<br>
As a result of the studies, it has been found that a uniformly mixed polymer of<br>
consistent quality can surprisingly be obtained despite no use of a stirring mechanism<br>
such as a stirring blade when the polymerization is performed while dropping a combined<br>
flow of polymerization intermediates supplied from the blocks of holes in a perforated<br>
plate comprising at least two blocks depending on the structure and placement of the<br>
support. As a consequence, it has become possible to produce a polymer whose<br>
characteristics are improved by copolymerizing a dissimilar monomer or blending a<br>
modifier, at high quality and low cost comparable to those of the original polymer whose<br>
characteristics are to be improved.<br>
The polymerization intermediates supplied from the blocks can also be the same<br>
as each other, of course; and the supply rate can also be set for each block to precisely<br>
control the polymerization rate and the polymerization degree of the polymer or to<br>
broaden the molecular weight distribution to improve the melt fluidity.<br>
[0099]<br>
(F-2) Description of Polycondensation Polymer<br>
For the purpose of the present invention, the polycondensation polymer refers to<br>
a polymer having a structure in which at least one type of monomers containing 2 or more<br><br>
-45-<br>
functional groups capable of undergoing condensation are bonded together via bonding of<br>
the functional groups. The monomer may be a monomer in which the functional groups<br>
are directly bonded to an aliphatic hydrocarbon group, or a monomer in which the<br>
functional groups are directly bonded to an aromatic hydrocarbon group.<br>
[0100]<br>
Specific examples of the polycondensation polymer include polymers with<br>
structures in which aliphatic hydrocarbon groups are bonded together via the bonding of<br>
functional groups, such as aliphatic polyesters, aliphatic polyamides, and aliphatic<br>
polycarbonates; polymers with structures in which aliphatic hydrocarbon groups and<br>
aromatic hydrocarbon groups are bonded together via the bonding of functional groups,<br>
such as aliphatic aromatic polyesters, aliphatic aromatic polyamides, and aliphatic<br>
aromatic polycarbonates; and polymers with structures in which aromatic hydrocarbon<br>
groups are bonded together via the bonding of functional groups, such as aromatic<br>
polyesters and aromatic polyamides.<br>
These polycondensation polymers may be either homopolymers or copolymers.<br>
Furthermore, copolymers containing different linkages such as ester linkages, amide<br>
linkages and carbonate linkages in either random or block-type arrangements are also<br>
suitable. Specific examples of these types of copolymers include polyester carbonates<br>
and polyesteramides.<br>
[0101]	v<br>
The polymerization intermediate is a polymer in the early stage of<br>
polymerization with a lower polymerization degree than that of the final product polymer,<br>
and may also contain oligomers or monomers. The intermediate is a product of<br>
preliminary polymerization to a desired polymerization degree using a reactor such as a<br>
conventional known vertical stirring polymerization reactor, a horizontally-stirred<br>
polymerization reactor with a uniaxial or biaxial stirring blade, a gravity flow-type thin<br>
film polymerization reactor with plates, a thin film polymerization reactor allowing<br>
gravity flow of the polymer on an inclined plane, a wetted-wall column, or the like.<br><br>
-46-<br>
By way of example, a polymerization intermediate for polyester is produced by<br>
polycondensation between a compound having hydroxyl groups and a compound having<br>
carboxyl groups or a compound having lower alcohol esters of carboxyl groups.<br>
A polymerization intermediate for polyamide is produced by polycondensation<br>
between a compound having amino groups and a compound having carboxyl groups. A<br>
polymerization intermediate for polycarbonate is produced by polycondensation between<br>
a compound in which the carboxyl groups thereof have aryloxy or alkoxy groups at both<br>
ends and a compound having hydroxyl groups.<br>
[0102]<br>
By way of specific example, a polymerization intermediate for aliphatic<br>
polyester is produced by polycondensation between a monomer in which hydroxyl<br>
groups are directly bonded to an aliphatic hydrocarbon group of 1 to 30 carbon atoms (e.g.,<br>
ethylene glycol) and a monomer in which carboxyl groups are directly bonded to an<br>
aliphatic hydrocarbon group of 1 to 30 carbon atoms (e.g., adipic acid) or by<br>
polycondensation between monomers in each of which hydroxyl and carboxyl groups are<br>
directly bonded to an aliphatic hydrocarbon group of 1 to 30 carbon atoms (e.g., glycolic<br>
acid).<br>
[0103]<br>
A polymerization intermediate for aliphatic aromatic polyester is produced by<br>
polycondensation between a monomer in which hydroxyl groups are directly bonded to<br>
an aliphatic hydrocarbon group of 1 to 30 carbon atoms (e.g., ethylene glycol,<br>
1,3-propanediol, 1,3-butanediol, 1,4-butanediol, neopentylglycol, 1,6-hexanemethylene<br>
glycol, 1,4-cyclohexanediol, 1,4-cyclohexanedimethanol) and a monomer in which<br>
carboxyl groups are directly bonded to an aromatic hydrocarbon group of 6 to 30 carbon<br>
atoms (e.g., terephthalic acid, isophthalic acid, oxalic acid, succinic acid, adipic acid,<br>
dodecanedioic acid, fumaric acid, maleic acid, 1,4-cyclohexanedicarboxylic acid,<br>
5-sodium sulfoisophtalate, 3,5-dicarboxybenzenesulfonate,<br>
1,4-cyclohexanedicarboxylic acid) or a monomer in which the carboxyl groups of these<br><br>
-47-<br>
compounds have been esterified with a lower alcohol.<br>
[0104]<br>
A polymerization intermediate for aromatic polyester is produced by<br>
polycondensation between a monomer in which hydroxyl groups are directly bonded to<br>
an aromatic hydrocarbon group of 6 to 30 carbon atoms (e.g., bisphenol A) and a<br>
monomer in which carboxyl groups are directly bonded to an aromatic hydrocarbon<br>
group of 6 to 30 carbon atoms (e.g., terephthalic acid).<br>
A polymerization intermediate for aliphatic polyamide is produced by<br>
polycondensation between a monomer in which amino groups are directly bonded to an<br>
aliphatic hydrocarbon group of 2 to 30 carbon atoms (e.g., hexamethylenediamine) and a<br>
monomer in which carboxyl groups are directly bonded to an aliphatic hydrocarbon group<br>
of 1 to 30 carbon atoms (e.g., adipic acid).<br>
[0105]<br>
A polymerization intermediate for aliphatic aromatic polyamide is produced by<br>
polycondensation between a monomer in which amino groups are directly bonded to an<br>
aliphatic hydrocarbon group of 2 to 30 carbon atoms (e.g., hexamethylenediamine) and a<br>
monomer in which carboxyl groups are directly bonded to an aromatic hydrocarbon<br>
group of 6 to 30 carbon atoms (e.g., terephthalic acid).<br>
A polymerization intermediate for aromatic polyamide is produced by<br>
polycondensation between a monomer in which amino groups are directly bonded to an<br>
aliphatic hydrocarbon group of 6 to 30 carbon atoms (e.g., para-phenylenediamine) and a<br>
monomer in which carboxyl groups are directly bonded to an aromatic hydrocarbon<br>
group of 6 to 30 carbon atoms (e.g., terephthalic acid).<br>
[0106]<br>
A polymerization intermediate for aliphatic polycarbonate is produced by<br>
polycondensation between a monomer in which hydroxyl groups are directly bonded to<br>
an aliphatic hydrocarbon group of 2 to 30 carbon atoms (e.g., 1,6-hexanediol) and a<br>
monomer in which phenoxy groups are bonded to both ends of the carboxyl groups<br><br>
-48-<br>
thereof (e.g., diphenyl carbonate).<br>
A polymerization intermediate for aliphatic aromatic polycarbonate is produced<br>
by polycondensation between a monomer in which hydroxyl groups are directly bonded<br>
to an aliphatic hydrocarbon group of 2 to 30 carbon atoms (e.g., 1,6-hexanediol), a<br>
monomer in which hydroxyl groups are directly bonded to an aromatic hydrocarbon<br>
group of 6 to 30 carbon atoms (e.g., bisphenol A) and a monomer in which phenoxy<br>
groups are bonded to both ends of the carboxyl groups thereof (e.g., diphenyl carbonate).<br>
[0107]<br>
Furthermore, all of these polymerization intermediates also include copolymers<br>
produced by preliminary copolymerization thereof with a polyalkylene glycol such as<br>
polyethylene glycol, polypropylene glycol, and polytetramethylene glycol.<br>
For specific methods of producing the above polymerization intermediates, one<br>
may refer to, for example, "Polymer Synthesis, vol. 1, second edition", 1992 (published<br>
by Academic Press, Inc., U.S.A.).<br>
[0108]<br>
The polymerization degree of a polymerization intermediate suitable for the<br>
present invention can be defined by a melt viscosity as evaluated under the condition of a<br>
shear rate of 1,000 (sec-1) at a temperature at which polymerization is conducted in the<br>
polymerization reactor of the present invention, and the melt viscosity is preferably in the<br>
range of 60 to 100,000 (poises). Not less than 60 poises can suppress heavy foaming and<br>
splattering of the polymerization intermediate discharged from the holes of the perforated<br>
plate of the polymerization reactor; not more than 100,000 (poises) allows the<br>
polymerization to rapidly proceed because it enables reaction by-products to be efficiently<br>
removed from the system. The range is more preferably 100 to 50,000 (poises), still more<br>
preferably 200 to 10,000 (poises), particularly preferably 300 to 5,000 (poises). The<br>
reason why a polymerization intermediate having a relatively high polymerization degree<br>
is thus preferable in the present invention is that as described above, polymerizing a<br>
polymer in a state containing a large amount of foam enables the polymerization rate to be<br><br>
-49-<br>
dramatically increased.<br>
[0109]<br>
(F-3) Description of Polymer Improver<br>
The polymer modifier, when used, is not particularly limited for the type thereof,<br>
and may be a liquid material at temperatures not more than the polymerization<br>
temperature of the polymer or a material including solid fine particles at such<br>
temperatures. The modifier may also be a material reacting with the polymer to form<br>
chemical bonding or a material not reacting with the polymer. It may also be a material<br>
having the catalytic effect of promoting polycondensation reaction or a material having<br>
the effect of suppressing the activity of a polymerization catalyst contained in a<br>
polymerization intermediate.<br>
[0110]<br>
Specific examples thereof include polyalkylene glycols such as polyethylene<br>
glycol, polypropylene glycol, and polytetramethylene glycol, which can be bonded to a<br>
polycondensation polymer and which impart, for example, ready stainability, flexibility,<br>
anti-noise and/or ant-static properties depending on the blending amount thereof;<br>
polyolefins such as polyethylene and polypropylene, which impart crystallization-<br>
promoting properties, slidability, and high melt fluidity; and terminal group-modified<br>
polyolefins which can be bonded to a polycondensation polymer; inorganic and organic<br>
materials such as particulate talc, silica and metal oxide, and multilayer organic powders,<br>
which impart mechanical properties, improved gloss in molded products, gas-barrier<br>
properties, oxygen absorption properties, antibacterial properties, and flame retardancy,<br>
and particulates into which functional groups are introduced capable of bonding to a<br>
polycondensation polymer; metal compounds such as those containing titanium,<br>
germanium, antimony, tin, aluminum, or cobalt, which impart a polymerization catalytic<br>
effect and a hue-improving effect; compounds such as those containing phosphorus,<br>
sulfur, or a halogen, which suppress the activity of a polymerization catalyst contained in<br>
a polymerization intermediate and inhibit thermal decomposition and the formation of<br><br>
-50-<br>
oligomers and the like; and other conventional known additives such as a delusterant, a<br>
heat stabilizer, a flame retardant, an antistatic agent, a dye, a pigment, an antifoaming<br>
agent, an orthochromatic agent, an antioxidant, an ultraviolet absorber, a crystal<br>
nucleating agent, a brightener, and scavengers for impurities and residual monomers.<br>
[0111]<br><br>
These modifiers are each supplied through any block of the perforated plate<br>
directly or in a mixture with the polymerization intermediate or with oil, polyethylene or<br>
the like facilitating dispersion. These modifiers may be supplied separately through the<br>
blocks or in a combination of a plurality thereof through the same block.<br>
[0112]<br>
(F-4) Description of Polymerization Reactor<br>
The polymerization reactor is a reactor in which the polymerization intermediate<br>
described above is supplied to the polymerization reactor in a melted state, is discharged<br>
through the holes of a perforated plate, and then undergoes a melt polycondensation under<br>
reduced pressure, while flowing down along the surface of a series of support.<br>
[0113]<br>
(F-4-1) Perforated Plate<br>
The term "perforated plate" refers to a plate-type body containing a plurality of<br>
through holes. By using this perforated plate, drift of the polymerization intermediate is<br>
suppressed and localized retention within certain sections inside the reactor is prevented,<br>
meaning polymer can be produced at higher and more consistent quality. The holes of the<br>
perforated plate in the polymerization reactor are grouped within a single block or<br>
grouped into two or more blocks; the polymerization can also be conducted by supplying<br>
to each block any polymerization intermediates and/or polymer modifier simultaneously<br>
at any supply rate.<br>
[0114]<br>
Although thickness in particular is not limited for the structure of a perforated<br>
plate, it is 0.1-300mm usually the range of 5-150mm still more preferably 1-200mm<br><br>
-51-<br>
preferably. The perforated plate must have sufficient strength to withstand the pressure<br>
from the supply chamber housing the melt polymerization intermediate, and in those<br>
cases where the support within the polymerization reactor is secured to the perforated<br>
plate, must also have sufficient strength to support the weight of the support, and the<br>
polymerization intermediate falling down the support, meaning perforated plates that<br>
have been reinforced with ribs or the like are one preferred option.<br>
The shape of the holes within the perforated plate are usually suitably selected<br>
from shapes including circles, ovals, triangles, slit shapes, polygons, and star shapes. The<br>
cross-sectional area of each hole is typically within a range from 0.01 to 100 cm2,<br>
preferably from 0.05 to 10 cm2, and even more preferably from 0.1 to 5 cm2.<br>
Furthermore, a nozzle or the like may also be connected to each of the holes.<br>
When divided into two or more blocks, it is also possible to change form and a<br>
cross-section area according to the contents of the supply thing for every block.<br>
[0115]<br>
The distance between holes, reported as the distance between hole centers, is<br>
typically from 1 to 500 mm, and preferably from 10 to 100 mm. The holes of the<br>
perforated plate may be through holes that pass through the perforated plate, or may be<br>
formed by the attachment of pipes to the perforated plate. Furthermore, the holes may<br>
also be tapered. The size and shape of the holes are preferably set so that the pressure loss<br>
as the polymerization intermediate passes through the perforated plate is from 0.1 to 50<br>
kg/cm2. When the holes are grouped into two or more blocks, the holes belonging to each<br>
block can also be subjected, according to the desired purpose, to random arrangement,<br>
concentric arrangement in the radial direction, alternating or periodic arrangement in the<br>
circumferential direction, alternating or periodic arrangement in a lattice form, collective<br>
arrangement for each block, or arrangement into a plurality of groups for each block.<br>
[0116]<br>
The number of holes of the perforated plate is not particularly limited and varies<br>
depending on conditions such as reaction temperature and pressure, the amount of a<br><br>
-52-<br>
catalyst, the range of molecular weight of an intermediate to be polymerized, and the like;<br>
however, for example, there are typically required 10 to 105 preferably 50 to 104, more<br>
preferably 102 to 103 holes when a polymer is produced at a rate of 100 kg/hr.<br>
When the holes are grouped into two or more blocks, the number of the blocks is also not<br>
particularly limited; however, it is typically in the range of 2 to 100 and preferably in the<br>
range of 2 to 50, more preferably 2 to 10 in view of a problem from the costs of facilities.<br>
There are also no particular restrictions on the number of holes within each block,<br>
although a typical number is within a range from 1 to 104, and if processing costs are<br>
considered, the number of holes is preferably within a range from 1 to 103. and even more<br>
preferably from 1 to 102. The number of holes belonging to each group may be either the<br>
same or different.<br>
The material of the perforated plate is preferably a metal material such as<br>
stainless steel, carbon steel, hastelloy, nickel, titanium, chrome, or another alloy.<br>
[0117]<br>
Examples of suitable methods of discharging the polymerization intermediate<br>
through the type of perforated plate described above include methods in which the<br>
polymerization intermediate is dripped from a liquid head or under its own weight, or<br>
methods in which a pump or the like is used to pressurize and force out the polymerization<br>
intermediate. In order to suppress variations in the quantity of polymerization<br>
intermediate flowing down through the reactor, force feeding the polymerization<br>
intermediate using a pump with a measuring function such as a gear pump is preferred.<br>
A filter is preferably provided in a position within the flow path that is upstream<br>
from the perforated plate. By employing a filter, impurities likely to cause blockages of<br>
the perforated plate holes can be removed. The type of filter used is selected so that<br>
impurities of sizes equal to or exceeding the hole diameter of the holes within the<br>
perforated plate can be removed, while the filter itself is undamaged by the passage of the<br>
polymerization intermediate.<br>
[0118]<br><br>
-53-<br>
(F-4-2) Support(s)<br>
The polymerization intermediate discharged from the perforated plate holes<br>
flows down along the support. Examples of specific structures for the support include<br>
wire-type structures, chain or lattice-type (wire mesh-type) structures in which a wire<br>
material has been linked together, three dimensional lattice structures in which a wire<br>
material has been interlinked in a so-called jungle-gym type structure, thin plate-type<br>
structures which may be either flat or curved, and perforated plate-type structures.<br>
In addition, in order to efficiently extract reaction by-products and impurities generated<br>
through thermal degradation during polymerization, it is preferable to increase the surface<br>
area of the resin allowed to flow down and further to cause the polymerization<br>
intermediate to flow down along a support having projections and depressions relative to<br>
the flow-down direction of the intermediate, thereby actively causing the mixing and<br>
surface renewal thereof. Support having structures opposing the downward flow of the<br>
resin, such as "a wire-form structure having projections and depressions relative to the<br>
flow-down direction of the resin" are also preferable. It is also preferable to use these<br>
supports in combination, or when the holes are grouped into two or more blocks, properly<br>
arrange the supports depending on the nature of a supply material from each block of the<br>
perforated plate. According to the purpose, the supports may be also arranged so that the<br>
flows of supply materials from the blocks are not combined with each other on each<br>
support or may be arranged so that the flows of the supply materials are combined with<br>
each other on each support.<br>
[0119]<br>
A wire-type support refers to a material in which the ratio of the length in a<br>
direction perpendicular to a cross-section, relative to the average length around the outer<br>
circumference of that cross-section, is extremely large. There are no particular<br>
restrictions on the surface area of the cross-section, but typically, the surface area is within<br>
a range from 10-3 to 102 cm2, and is preferably from 10-3 to 101 cm2, and even more<br>
preferably from 10"2 to 1 cm2. There are also no particular restrictions on the shape of this<br><br>
-54-<br>
cross-section, which is typically selected from shapes including circles, ovals, triangles.<br>
squares, polygons, and star shapes and the like.<br>
The cross-sectional shape may stay the same throughout the length of the support, but<br>
may also vary. Furthermore, the wire may also be hollow. The term "wire" includes<br>
both single wire strands, as well as materials in which a plurality of wire strands are<br>
combined by a method such as twisting the wires together. The surface of the wire may<br>
be smooth, may include indentations, or may be partially covered with protrusions or the<br>
like.<br>
[0120]<br>
A chain-type support refers to a material in which rings formed using a wire<br>
material described above have been interlinked. The shape of these rings may be circular,<br>
oval, rectangular, or square or the like. The interlinking of these rings may be one<br>
dimensional, two dimensional or three dimensional.<br>
A lattice-type (wire mesh-type) structure refers to a material in which a wire<br>
material described above has been linked together in a lattice-type arrangement. The<br>
wire may be either straight or curved, and the angles involved in the linking can be<br>
selected as desired. There are no particular restrictions on the surface area ratio between<br>
solid material and space when the lattice-type (wire mesh-type) material is viewed from a<br>
direction perpendicular to the surface of the lattice, but the ratio is typically within a range<br>
from 1:0.5 to 1:1,000, preferably from 1:1 to 1:500, and even more preferably from 1:5 to<br>
1:100. This surface area ratio is preferably equal across the horizontal direction, whereas<br>
in the vertical direction, the surface area ratio is preferably either equal, or shifts to a larger<br>
proportion of space towards the lower portions of the support.<br>
[0121]<br>
A three dimensional lattice-type structure refers to a material in which a wire<br>
material has been linked together in a three dimensional lattice similar to a so-called<br>
jungle gym. The wire may be either straight or curved, and the angles involved in the<br>
linking can be selected as desired.<br><br>
-55-<br>
A wire-type support with irregularities within the downward flow direction of<br>
the polymer refers either to a structure in which rod-like objects with a circular<br>
cross-section or a polygonal cross-section are attached at right angles to the wire, or to a<br>
structure in which circular discs or circular cylindrical objects are attached to the wire.<br>
The level difference provided by these irregularities is preferably at least 5 mm. Specific<br>
examples of these supports include circular disc-fitted wires in which a wire is passed<br>
through the center of a series of circular discs of thickness 1 to 50 mm, which have a<br>
diameter that is at least 5 mm larger than the wire diameter but is no more than 100 mm,<br>
and the spacing between the circular discs is set to value within a range from 1 to 500 mm.<br>
[0122]<br>
Although there are no particular restrictions on the ratio between the volume of<br>
the support disposed inside the reactor and the internal volume of the reactor, the ratio is<br>
typically within a range from 1:0.5 to 1:107, and is preferably from 1:10 to 1:106, and even<br>
more preferably from 1:50 to 1:10". The ratio (support volume : internal volume of the<br>
reactor) is preferably equal across the horizontal direction, whereas in the vertical<br>
direction, the ratio is preferably either equal, or shifts to a larger proportion for the internal<br>
volume of the reactor towards the lower portions of the support.<br>
Depending on the shape of the support, either a single support or a plurality of<br>
supports may be provided. In the case of wire-type or chain-type support, the number of<br>
supports is typically within a range from 1 to 105 and preferably from 3 to 104. In the<br>
case of lattice-type support, two dimensionally linked chain-type support, thin-plate type<br>
support, and perforated plate-type support, the number of support is typically within a<br>
range from 1 to 10 , and preferably from 2 to 103 In the case of a three dimensionally<br>
linked chain-type support or a three dimensional lattice-type support, the decision as to<br>
whether to use a single support, or to divide the support and provide a plurality of supports,<br>
can be made with due consideration of factors such as the size of the reactor and the space<br>
available for installing the support.<br>
[0123]<br><br>
-56-<br>
In those cases where a plurality of supports are provided, spacers or the like are<br>
preferably used to ensure that the supports do not contact each other.<br>
Although there are no particular restrictions on the material used for forming the<br>
support, the material is typically selected from amongst stainless steel, carbon steel,<br>
hastelloy, and titanium and the like.<br>
Furthermore, if required, the wire may also be subjected to any of a variety of<br>
surface treatments such as plating, lining, passivity treatment, or acid washing.<br>
[0124]<br>
In the present invention, usually, the polymerization intermediate is supplied<br>
from one or perforated plate holes to each support, although the number of holes can be<br>
selected appropriately in accordance with the shape of the support. Furthermore, causing<br>
the polymerization intermediate that has been discharged through a single hole to flow<br>
down a plurality of supports are also possible. Moreover, depending on the purpose of<br>
the treatment, if a perforated plate is used in which the holes have been divided into two or<br>
more blocks, then the polymerization intermediate can be supplied from the holes of a<br>
plurality of perforated plate blocks to a single support, or can also be supplied from the<br>
holes of a single block to one or more supports.<br>
[0125]<br>
There are no particular restrictions on the positioning of the support, provided<br>
the polymerization intermediate is able to flow down the support. Suitable methods for<br>
attaching the support to the perforated plate include passing the support through the<br>
perforated plate holes, and fixing the support beneath the perforated plate holes.<br>
Although there are no particular restrictions on the height the polymerization<br>
intermediate having passed through the holes flows down along the support, the height is<br>
preferably within a range from 0.5 to 50 m, even more preferably from 1 to 20 m, and<br>
most preferably from 2 to 10 m.<br>
[0126]<br>
(F-4-3) Heating Device<br><br>
-57-<br>
The polymerization temperature can be set to an appropriate level by controlling<br>
the temperature of a heater or heating jacket disposed within the side walls of the<br>
polymerization reactor that encloses the support, or by providing a heater or heating<br>
medium inside the support and then controlling the temperature of this heater or medium.<br>
[0127]<br>
(F-4-4) Pressure Reduction Device<br>
The pressure inside the polymerization reactor can be set to an appropriate level<br>
by connecting a vent positioned at a desired location in the polymerization reactor to a<br>
vacuum line, and then appropriately adjusting the degree of pressure reduction.<br>
By-products of the polymerization, impurities generated by thermal decomposition<br>
during the polymerization, and the small quantity of inert gas introduced into the<br>
polymerization reactor as required are all discharged from the vent.<br>
[0128]<br>
(F-4-5) Inert Gas Supply Device<br>
In those cases where an inert gas is introduced directly into the polymerization<br>
reactor, supply of the inert gas can be conducted through an inlet positioned at a desired<br>
location in the polymerization reactor. This inert gas inlet is preferably positioned distant<br>
from the perforated plate and in the vicinity of the polymer extraction port. Furthermore,<br>
the inlet is preferably distant from the pressure reduction vent.<br>
Alternatively, a method can be employed in which the inert gas is absorbed or<br>
incorporated within the polymerization intermediate in advance, and in this case, an<br>
additional inert gas supply device is provided upstream from the polymerization reactor of<br>
the present invention.<br>
[0129]<br>
Examples of methods of supplying the inert gas include methods that employ<br>
conventional absorption devices such as a packed column absorption device, a tray type<br>
absorption device, or a spray column type absorption device disclosed in "Chemical<br>
Apparatus Design and Operation", Series No. 2, revised edition, gas absorption pp. 49 to<br><br>
-58-<br>
54 (published March 15, 1981, by Kagaku Kogyo Co., Ltd.), and methods in which the<br>
inert gas is injected into the pipes transporting the polymerization intermediate. The most<br>
desirable method employs a device in which the polymerization intermediate is caused to<br>
absorb the inert gas while flowing down a support within an inert gas atmosphere. In this<br>
method, a higher pressure of inert gas is introduced into the inert gas absorption device<br>
than the pressure inside the polymerization reactor. This pressure within the inert gas<br>
absorption device is preferably within a range from 0.01 to 1 MPa, even more preferably<br>
from 0.05 to 0.5 MPa, and most preferably from 0.1 to 0.2 MPa.<br>
[0130]<br>
(F-5) Description of Polymerization Method<br>
The inventors of the present invention discovered that by polymerizing a<br><br>
polymerization intermediate with a melt viscosity within the range described above, using<br>
an aforementioned polymerization reactor and at; a polymerization temperature and<br>
degree of pressure reduction described below, splattering of the polymerization<br>
intermediate caused by heavy foaming immediately below the perforated plate could be<br>
suppressed, deterioration in the polymer quality caused by contamination of the nozzle<br>
surface or the wall surfaces of the polymerization reactor could also be suppressed, and<br><br>
surprisingly, the polymer flowing down along the support is converted to a state which<br>
incorporates large quantities of foam, generating phenomena in which "the surface area of<br>
the polymer increases", and "the polymer develops a foam ball type structure, which<br>
tumbles down along the support". At the same time, a dramatic increase in the<br>
polymerization rate and an improvement in the polymer hue were also confirmed.<br>
It is thought that the dramatic increase in the polymerization rate is a compound<br>
effect arising from the increase in surface area resulting from the incorporation of a large<br>
quantity of foam, and the surface renewal effect caused by the plasticizing action of the<br>
foam. Furthermore, this foam plasticizing action improves the polymer hue by<br>
shortening the residence time for the polymer within the polymerization reactor, and<br>
enables a high viscosity polymer that exhibits a high polymerization degree to be<br><br>
-59-<br>
extracted easily from the polymerization reactor.<br>
[0131]<br>
In order to obtain a high quality polymer at a high polymerization degree using a<br>
conventional gravity flow-based melt thin-film polymerization reactor such as a<br>
wetted-wall column, a polymerization intermediate from the early stages of reaction,<br>
which exhibits little coloring but has a much lower polymerization degree than the<br>
polymerization intermediate used in the method of the present invention, is polymerized<br>
at a higher temperature and with a shorter residence time than is the case for the method of<br>
the present invention. Conventional thinking would suggest that if a polymerization<br>
intermediate with a high polymerization degree was subjected to melt polymerization,<br>
then the coloration of the polymerization intermediate would get progressively stronger,<br>
and the residence time during flow down through the polymerization reactor would<br>
increase, and the fact that a high quality polymer can be produced would have been totally<br>
inconceivable.<br>
[0132]<br>
However, in the present invention, the inventors discovered that, as described<br>
above, by setting the melt viscosity of the polymerization intermediate to a high value, in<br>
contravention of conventional thinking, and as described below, setting the<br>
polymerization temperature to a low temperature, also in contravention of conventional<br>
thinking, the foaming of the polymer could be controlled, and in a surprising finding, the<br>
polymerization rate at the low temperature could actually be increased dramatically, and a<br>
polymer with a high polymerization degree could be extracted with ease.<br>
[0133]<br>
(F-5-1) Polymerization Temperature<br>
The polycondensation reaction temperature is preferably equal to or higher than<br>
the (crystalline melting point -10°C) of the polycondensation polymer, and no higher than<br>
the (crystalline melting point + 60°C). By ensuring the reaction temperature is equal to or<br>
higher than the (crystalline melting point - 10°C), solidification during the reaction and<br><br>
-60-<br>
lengthening of the reaction time can be prevented, whereas by ensuring that the<br>
temperature is no higher than the (crystalline melting point + 60°C), thermal<br>
decomposition can be suppressed, enabling the production of a polymer of excellent hue.<br>
The temperature is even more preferably equal to or higher than the (crystalline melting<br>
point - 5°C) and no higher than the (crystalline melting point + 40°C), and is most<br>
preferably equal to or higher than the crystalline melting point and no higher than the<br>
(crystalline melting point + 30°C). The reason that these types of comparatively low<br>
reaction temperatures are preferred in the present invention is because such temperatures<br>
facilitate the polymer reaching a state that incorporates a large quantity of foam, thereby<br>
enabling the polymerization rate to be increased dramatically.<br>
[0134]<br>
In this description, the crystalline melting point refers to the peak temperature of<br>
the heat absorption peak generated on crystal melting using a Pyris 1 DSC (an input<br>
compensation-type differential scanning calorimeter) manufactured by PerkinElmer, Inc.,<br>
under the conditions described below. The peak temperature was determined using the<br>
included analysis software.<br>
Measurement temperature: 0 to 300°C<br>
Rate of temperature increase: 10°C /minute<br>
[0135]<br>
(F-5-2) Polymerization Pressure<br>
The melt polycondensation reaction of the present invention must be conducted<br>
under reduced pressure to ensure the polymer reaches a state that incorporates a large<br>
quantity of foam. The degree of pressure reduction can be set appropriately in<br>
accordance with factors such as the sublimation states of the polymerization intermediate<br>
and the polycondensation reaction product, and the reaction rate. The reduced pressure is<br>
preferably no more than 50,000 Pa, even more preferably no more than 10,000 Pa, even<br>
more preferably no more than 1,000 Pa, and most preferably 500 Pa or lower.<br>
There are no particular restrictions on the lower limit, although considering factors such as<br><br>
-61-<br>
the scale of the facilities required for reducing the pressure within the polymerization<br>
reactor, a pressure of at least 0.1 Pa is preferred.<br>
Furthermore, another preferred method involves introducing a small quantity of<br>
an inert gas that exerts no deleterious effects on the polycondensation reaction into the<br>
polymerization reactor, so that polymerization by-products and/or impurities generated by<br>
thermal decomposition during the polymerization can be removed from the<br>
polymerization reactor together with the inert gas.<br>
[0136]<br>
The introduction of an inert gas into a polymerization reactor is conventionally<br>
understood to enhance the progression of the reaction by lowering the partial pressure of<br>
polymerization by-products, thereby causing a shift in the equilibrium. However, in the<br>
present invention, the quantity of inert gas introduced need only be very small, and is too<br>
small to expect any significant increase in the polymerization rate as a result of a partial<br>
pressure reduction effect, meaning the role of the inert gas in the present invention cannot<br>
be explained using conventional wisdom.<br>
Investigations by the inventors of the present invention revealed, in a surprising<br>
result, that by introducing an inert gas into the polymerization reactor, the foaming<br>
phenomenon observed for the melted polymerization intermediate flowing down along<br>
the supports is enhanced significantly, causing a dramatic increase in the surface area of<br>
the polymerization intermediate, and a far more fevorable surface renewal action. The<br>
principles behind these observations are not entirely clear, although it is surmised that<br>
these variations in the interior and surface states of the polymerization intermediate are<br>
responsible for the dramatic increase in the polymerization rate.<br>
[0137]<br>
The inert gas introduced into the system preferably has no deleterious effects on<br>
the resin such as coloration, transformation, or decomposition, and suitable examples<br>
include nitrogen, argon, helium, carbon dioxide, lower hydrocarbon gases, and mixtures<br>
thereof. Nitrogen, argon, helium, or carbon dioxide are preferred as the inert gas, and of<br><br>
-62-<br>
these, in terms of ease of availability, nitrogen is particularly desirable. The quantity of<br>
inert gas introduced in the present invention is preferably kept very small, and is<br>
preferably within a range from 0.05 to 100 mg per 1 g of the polymer extracted from the<br>
polymerization reactor. By ensuring that the quantity of the inert gas is at least 0.05 mg<br>
per 1 g of extracted polymer, satisfactory foaming of the resin is achieved, and the<br>
polymerization rate accelerating effect can be enhanced. On the other hand, restricting<br>
the inert gas quantity to no more than 100 mg facilitates pressure reduction. The quantity<br>
of the inert gas is even more preferably within a range from 0.1 to 50 mg, and most<br>
preferably from 0.2 to 10 mg, per 1 g of the extracted polymer.<br>
[0138]	<br>
Suitable methods of introducing the inert gas include methods in which the gas is<br>
introduced directly into the polymerization reactor, methods in which the inert gas is<br>
absorbed or incorporated into the polymerization intermediate in advance, and this<br>
absorbed and/or incorporated gas is then released from the polymerization intermediate<br>
under reduced pressure and thus introduced into the polymerization reactor, and<br>
combinations of these methods. Here, the term "absorbed" refers to the case in which the<br>
inert gas is dissolved within the polymer and does not exist as gas bubbles, whereas the<br>
term "incorporated" means the gas exists as bubbles within the polymer. In those cases<br>
when the inert gas exists as gas bubbles, the size of these bubbles is preferably as small as<br>
possible, and the average gas bubble diameter is preferably no more than 5 mm, and even<br>
more preferably 2 mm or smaller.<br>
[0139]<br>
(F-5-3) Polymerization Time<br>
The polymerization time refers to the combined total of the time required for the<br>
polymer to flow down along the support and the time the polymer is retained in the<br>
bottom of the polymerization reactor, and is preferably within a range from 10 seconds to<br>
100 hours, even more preferably from 1 minute to 10 hours, even more preferably from 5<br>
minutes to 5 hours, and most preferably from 20 minutes to 3 hours.<br><br>
-63-<br>
The polymerization method of the present invention includes methods in which<br>
the polymer produced by polymerization of the polymerization intermediate is extracted<br>
entirely from the polymerization reactor in a one-pass operation, and methods in which a<br>
portion of the polymerized polymer is recirculated and introduced into the polymerization<br>
reactor for a second time. Among those, the method in which the polymer is extracted<br>
entirely in a one-pass operation are preferred. In those cases where some polymer is<br>
recirculated, in order to suppress thermal decomposition within the lower region of the<br>
polymerization reactor and the recirculation line, the residence times within these regions<br>
are preferably kept short, and the temperature is preferably lowered.<br>
[0140]<br>
(F-5-4) Polymerization rate<br>
In the case of wire-type supports, the polymerization capability of the<br>
polymerization reactor increases in proportion to the number of supports provided within<br>
the polymerization reactor, offering the advantage that scaling up the design is relatively<br>
simple. In the case of wire-type supports, the flow rate of the polymerization<br>
intermediate for each supports is preferably within a range from 10-2 to 102 liters/hour.<br>
By ensuring the flow rate falls within this range, a satisfactory production capability can<br>
be achieved, and the polymerization rate can also be increased dramatically. Flow rates<br>
within a range from 0.1 to 50 liters/hour are even more desirable.<br>
[0141]<br>
In the case of supports such as lattice-type (wire mesh-type) supports, where<br>
wire sections are interlinked, the polymerization intermediate flow rate is preferably<br>
within a range from 10-2 to 102 liters/hour, and even more preferably from 0.1 to 50<br>
liters/hour, for each vertical wire structure within the support.<br>
In the case of supports such as thin plate-type supports which do not employ wire<br>
structures, the flow rate is preferably within a range from 10-2 to 102 liters/hour, and even<br>
more preferably from 0.1 to 50 liters/hour, per perforated plate hole that supplies the<br>
polymerization intermediate to the supports.<br><br>
-64-<br>
[0142]<br>
(F-5-5) Other<br>
In addition to the aforementioned method in which supply is conducted through<br>
a perforated plate of the polymerization reactor, the method of the present invention also<br>
includes those cases in which a uniaxial or biaxial mixing device or a static mixer or the<br>
like is disposed between the polymerization reactor and the molding device, meaning<br>
additives such as stabilizers, nucleating agents, or pigments or the like can then be added<br>
to the resin as required.<br>
In the present invention, if required, a variety of different additives such as<br>
delustering agents, heat stabilizers, flame retardants, antistatic agents, antifoaming agents,<br>
color correction agents, antioxidants, ultraviolet absorbers, crystal nucleating agents,<br>
brightening agents, and capture agents for impurities can be either copolymerized or<br>
mixed with the polymer. These additives can be added at any stage within the method of<br>
the present invention.<br>
[0143]<br>
In the method of the present invention, the addition of a stabilizer that is<br>
appropriate for the polymer undergoing polymerization is particularly desirable. Using<br>
polyester resin as an example, the addition of either a pentavalent and/or a trivalent<br>
phosphorus compound, or a hindered phenol-bastd compound is preferred.<br>
The quantity added of the phosphorus compound, recorded as the weight proportion of<br>
phosphorus atoms within the product polymer, is preferably within a range from 2 to 500<br>
ppm, and even more preferably from 10 to 200 ppm. Specific examples of preferred<br>
phosphorus compounds include trimethyl phosphite, phosphoric acid, and phosphorous<br>
acid. Phosphorus-based compounds suppress coloration of the polymer and also function<br>
as crystal nucleating agents, and are consequently preferred.<br>
[0144]<br>
A hindered phenol-based compound is a phenol-based derivative in which the<br>
positions adjacent to the phenolic hydroxyl group are substituted with substituents that<br><br>
-65-<br>
exhibit steric hindrance, and is a compound that also includes at least one ester linkage<br>
within the molecule. The quantity added of the hindered phenol-based compound, as the<br>
weight proportion of the compound within the product polymer, is preferably within a<br>
range from 0.001 to 1% by weight, and even more preferably from 0.01 to 0.2% by<br>
weight.<br>
Examples of specific compounds include pentaerythritol, tetrakis[3-(3,5-di-tert-<br>
butyl-4-hydroxyphenyl)propionate],1,1,3-tris(2-methyl-4-hydroxy-5-tert-butylphenyl)<br>
butane, octadecyl-3-(3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxyphenyl)propionate, and<br>
N,N'-hexamethylenebis(3,5-tert-butyl-4-hydroxyhydrocinnamide). Using a combination<br>
of these stabilizers is another preferred method.<br>
[0145]<br>
These stabilizers can be added at any stage up to and including molding, but<br>
phosphorus compounds are preferably added in the initial stages of the polycondensation<br>
reaction, and hindered phenol-based compounds are preferably added during either the<br>
initial stages of the polycondensation reaction, or following extraction of the polymer<br>
from the polymerization reactor.<br>
Furthermore, in the present invention, the addition of a crystal nucleating agent<br>
is also preferred, and using polyester resin as an example, the addition of a<br>
phosphorus-based compound, a metal salt of an organic acid, a polyolefin, or a powder of<br>
some other resin is preferred. The quantity added of this crystal nucleating agent is<br>
preferably within a range from 2 to 1,000 ppm, and even more preferably from 10 to 500<br>
ppm, within the polymer.<br>
[0146]<br>
Specific examples of suitable compounds include phosphates such as sodium<br>
2,2'-methylenebis(4,6-di-t-butylphenyl)phosphate and sodium bis(4-t-butylphenyl)<br>
phosphate, sorbitols such as bis(p-methylbenzylidene)sorbitol, and metal element-<br>
containing compounds such as hydroxyaluminum bis(4-t-butylbenzoate). Particularly in<br>
the case of preforms for PET bottles, in which the mouth portion is subjected to thermal<br><br>
-66-<br>
crystallization, these crystal nucleating agents can be used favorably for accelerating the<br>
crystallization and lowering the thermal crystallization temperature.<br>
[0147]<br>
Furthermore, in the present invention, the addition of a capture agent for low<br>
molecular weight volatile impurities is another preferred option. Using the case of PET<br>
as an example, the impurity is acetaldehyde, and suitable capture agents include<br>
polyamide and polyesteramide polymers and oligomers, and low molecular weight<br>
compounds with an amide group or amino group such as 2-aminobenzamide. Specific<br>
examples include polyamide and polyethyleneimine polymers such as nylon 6.6, nylon 6,<br>
and nylon 4.6, as well as the reaction product of N-phenylbenzeneamine and<br>
2,4,4-trimethylpentene, and Irganox 1098 and Irganox 565 (registered trademarks)<br>
manufactured by Ciba Specialty Chemicals Inc. These capture agents are preferably<br>
added in the period from removal of the polymer from the polymerization reactor through<br>
until supply of the polymer to the molding device.<br>
[0148]<br>
Using a PET polymerization as an example, as follows is a description of the<br>
method of producing a polycondensation polymer using the polymerization reactor of the<br>
present invention, based on the drawings. In FIG. 7, a PET polymerization intermediate<br>
is supplied to the polymerization reactor via a raw material supply port 2 using a feed<br>
pump (A) 1 and/or a feed pump (B) 1, and this intermediate passes through the holes<br>
within a block A and/or the holes within a block B on a perforated plate 3, enters the<br>
polymerization reactor, and then flows down a series of support 5. At this point, a<br>
polymerization intermediate for a different polymer and/or a polymer improver could also<br>
be supplied via the feed pump (A) 1 or the feed pump (B) 1, instead of the PET<br>
polymerization intermediate. The perforated plate 3 can, of course, also be configured<br>
with a single block instead of a plurality of blocks, and the plurality of feed pumps for the<br>
PET polymerization intermediate can be replaced with a single feed pump, with the<br>
polymerization intermediate then supplied to the polymerization process using this single<br><br>
-67-<br>
feed pump.<br>
[0149]<br>
The inside of the polymerization reactor is controlled at a predetermined degree<br>
of pressure reduction, and the by-product ethylene glycol, and the inert gas such as<br>
nitrogen, which can be introduced as required through an inert gas supply port 6, are<br>
discharged through a pressure reduction exhaust port 7. The polymerized polymer is<br>
discharged from discharge port 9 by drainage pump 8.<br>
During the process in which the polymerization proceeds as the polymerization<br>
intermediate flows down along the support, if the perforated plate is divided into two or<br>
more blocks, then the blocks and the support may be positioned so that the material flows<br>
supplied from each of the blocks do not merge on the support, or may also be positioned<br>
so that the supplied material flows do merge on the supports, and this selection can be<br>
made in accordance with the purpose of the process.<br>
[0150]<br>
After falling to the lower portion of the polymerization reactor, the polymerized<br>
polymer is extracted from the discharge port using a drainage pump, but during this<br>
process, the quantity of polymer accumulated in the lower portion of the polymerization<br>
reactor is preferably kept as small and as constant as possible. One example of a method<br>
of controlling the quantity of accumulated polymer involves inspecting the quantity of<br>
product through an observation window, or using a level meter such as a capacitance<br>
meter to monitor the quantity of product, and then adjusting the flow rates through the<br>
feed pumps and the drainage pump accordingly.<br>
The feed pumps, main body of the polymerization reactor , the drainage pump,<br>
and the transport piping and the like are heated and insulated using a heater or a jacket.<br>
[0151]<br>
The polymerization reactor may have a stirrer or the like fitted within the bottom<br>
of the polymerization reactor, although such a stirrer is not particularly necessary.<br>
Accordingly, the rotational drive section can be remoVed from the main body of the<br><br>
-68-<br>
polymerization reactor, enabling polymerization to be conducted under favorably sealed<br>
conditions, even when the system is placed under high vacuum. Because the rotational<br>
drive section of the drainage pump is covered by the resin waiting to be discharged the<br>
sealing properties are vastly superior to cases in which a rotational drive section is fitted to<br>
the main body of the polymerization reactor.<br>
The polymerization can be conducted using either a single polymerization reactor or<br>
two or more polymerization reactors.<br>
[0152]<br>
The process of raising the molecular weight from that of the PET polymerization<br>
intermediate to a PET with the desired polymerization degree can be conducted entirely<br>
using the method in which the intermediate is supplied through the holes of the perforated<br>
plate and then undergoes polymerization while flowing down along the support, but is<br>
preferably conducted by an appropriate combination of this method with other<br>
polymerization methods such as those that employ a stirred tank-type polymerization<br>
reactor or a horizontally-stirred polymerization reactor.<br>
Examples of horizontally-stirred polymerization reactors include screw-type,<br>
independent blade-type, uniaxial-type, and biaxial-type reactors, such as the<br>
polymerization reactors disclosed in chapter 4, Research Report of Research Group on<br>
Reaction Engineering: Reactive Processing Part 2 (Society of Polymer Science, 1992).<br>
[0153]<br>
Furthermore, stirred tank-type polymerization reactors include any of the stirred<br>
tanks described in chapter 11 of Handbook of Chemical Equipment (edited by Society of<br>
Chemical Engineers, Japan; 1989).<br>
There are no particular restrictions on the shape of the tank, although typically, a<br>
vertical or horizontal circular cylinder is used. Furthermore, there are no particular<br>
restrictions on the shape of the stirring blades, and suitable shapes include paddle-type,<br>
anchor-type, turbine-type, screw-type, ribbon-type, and double blade-type stirrers.<br>
[0154]<br><br>
-69-<br>
The steps required for producing the prepolymer from the raw materials can be<br>
conducted using a batch-type operation or using a continuous operation. In the case of a<br>
batch operation, the entire quantities of the raw materials and other reactants are supplied<br>
to the polymerization reactor, and following reaction for a predetermined period, the<br>
entire reaction product is transferred to the next reactor. On the other hand, when the<br>
steps are performed continuously, the raw materials and reactants may be continuously<br>
supplied to each reactor, followed by discharging the reaction product continuously. In<br>
order to produce large quantities of a PET of uniform quality and molded products thereof,<br>
a continuous operation is preferred.<br>
[0155]<br>
(F-6) Method of Cleaning Polymerization Reactor<br>
Next is a description of a method of cleaning a polymerization reactor.<br>
When a polymerization operation that has been conducted using the method<br>
described above is halted, the inside of the polymerization reactor is prone to the retention<br>
of residual polymerization intermediates, raw materials, and modified products thereof.<br>
As a method of cleaning a conventional stirred tank-type polymerization reactor<br>
in which inside of a polymerization reactor is filled with a glycol, and the glycol is then<br>
heated to a temperature close to its boiling point while being stirred, thereby<br>
depolymerizing and removing any residual polymers and the like has already been<br>
disclosed. However, if an attempt is made to apply this type of method to the<br>
polymerization reactor of the present invention described above, then the large quantity of<br>
residual polymer and the like retained on the support inside the polymerization reactor is<br>
stripped from the support and accumulates in aggregate form, and because the reactor is<br>
not provided with a stirring mechanism, an extremely lengthy period of time is required to<br>
ensure complete depolymerization of the residual polymer.<br>
[0156]<br>
As a result of intensive investigation, the inventors of the present invention<br>
discovered that by causing the residual polymer, polymerization intermediates, and<br><br>
-70-<br>
modified products thereof retained on the support to come into contact with a solvent<br>
vapor while flowing down along the surface of the support, these residual materials could<br>
be stripped from the support and washed away without accumulating as aggregates by<br>
using only a small quantity of solvent, and that particularly in those cases where one<br>
component of the solvent vapor acts as a molecular weight reducing agent, the residual<br>
materials could be decomposed to low molecular weight substances and removed within a<br>
very short period of time, even without using a depolymerization catalyst or the like, and<br>
the inventors were thus able to complete this aspect of the present invention.<br>
[0157]<br>
The support within the polymerization reactor is preferably wire-type structure<br>
or the like. Regardless of the structure of the support, it is characterized in that a<br>
relationship S1/S2 &gt; 1 is satisfied where S1 is a surface area of the thermoplastic polymer<br>
flowing down along the support and S2 is a contact surface area between the support and<br>
the thermoplastic polymer. Here, S1 is the surface area of the flowing-down<br>
thermoplastic polymer, and S2 is the contact area between the support and the polymer.<br>
[0158]<br>
In contrast, cases in which S1/S2 = 
either flat plate or the internal walls of a wetted-wall column, and in these cases, although<br>
the quantity of residual polymer retained on the support is smaller, owing to the fact that<br>
the surface area of the support is smaller than that of the polymerization reactor of the<br>
present invention, the strength with which the residual polymer is retained is higher,<br>
meaning the thickness of the residual polymer resin film is larger, which causes a<br>
deterioration in the efficiency of the cleaning process. Moreover, if a large quantity of<br>
liquid solvent is caused to flow over the support, then the polymer tends to accumulate<br>
and generate aggregates on the support, further worsening the efficiency of the cleaning<br>
process.<br>
[0159]<br>
Moreover, depending on the strength of the support provided inside the<br><br>
-71-<br>
polymerization reactor, and the crystallinity of the polycondensation polymer produced<br>
using the polymerization reactor, there is a danger that the volumetric shrinkage<br>
associated with crystallization of the residual polymer may cause an irreversible<br>
deformation of the support, resulting in a change in the characteristics of the<br>
polymerization reactor. Furthermore, once the residual polymer has crystallized,<br>
absorption of the solvent vapor by the polymer is also inhibited. In the present invention,<br>
following completion of the polymerization and halting of the polymerization operation,<br>
the solvent vapor is preferably introduced into the polymerization reactor with the<br>
temperature inside the reactor retained at a level equal to, or higher than, the temperature<br>
at which the polycondensation polymer undergoes crystallization. The temperature<br>
inside the polymerization reactor is even more preferably equal to, or higher than, the<br>
melting point of the polycondensation polymer, but no higher than the decomposition<br>
temperature of the polycondensation polymer. Accordingly, when the solvent is<br>
introduced into the polymerization reactor, a method in which the solvent is heated to a<br>
temperature equal to, or higher than, the temperature at which the polycondensation<br>
polymer undergoes crystallization prior to introduction is preferred.<br>
[0160]<br>
The distance the residual polymer and the like flows during the period of contact<br>
with the solvent vapor while flowing down along the surface of the support is preferably<br>
at least 0.5 m. If this fall distance is too short, then the dissolution and/or<br>
depolymerization may be inadequate, meaning the polymer can descend and fall from the<br>
end of the support in an unmodified high viscosity state, and then combine to form<br>
aggregates, thereby dramatically reducing the treatment efficiency. There are no<br>
particular restrictions on the fall distance, although in terms of enhancing the cleaning<br>
efficiency, the distance is preferably within a range from 0.5 to 50 m, even more<br>
preferably from 1 to 20 m, and most preferably from 2 to 15 m. This fall distance can be<br>
selected in accordance with factors such as the length of the support within the<br>
polymerization reactor, and the height of the liquid level within the lower portion of the<br><br>
-72-<br>
polymerization reactor.<br>
The solvents and molecular weight reducing agents used in cleaning the residual<br>
polymer and the like can be selected appropriately from those materials described above<br>
in section (C). Furthermore, in order to further shorten the cleaning time, cleaning agents<br>
such as primary or secondary amines, acetic anhydride, phosphate esters, and phosphite<br>
esters can also be used in combination if required.<br>
[0161]<br>
Suitable methods of supplying these solvents and molecular weight reducing<br>
agents include (1) methods in which at least a portion of a solvent and/or a molecular<br>
weight reducing agent that has been used for sequentially cleaning facilities positioned<br>
upstream from the polymerization reactor, such as reactors other than a polymerization<br>
reactor and polymer piping, is introduced into a polymerization reactor together with the<br>
polymer flow through a polymerization reactor raw material supply port, (2) methods in<br>
which the solvent and/or molecular weight reducing agent is absorbed by, or incorporated<br>
into the polymer in advance, and this polymer mixture is then supplied to the<br>
polymerization reactor through the polymerization reactor raw material supply port, (3)<br>
methods in which the solvent and/or molecular weight reducing agent is supplied directly<br>
to the main body of the polymerization reactor, either in a liquid and/or a gaseous state,<br>
and (4) methods that employ a combination of these methods.<br>
[0162]<br>
In those cases where the solvent and/or molecular weight reducing agent is<br>
supplied directly to the main body of the polymerization reactor, the supply can be<br>
conducted through the raw material supply port of the polymerization reactor, the polymer<br>
extraction port located in the bottom of the polymerization reactor, or a solvent supply<br>
port or the like positioned at a desired location in the polymerization reactor. The position<br>
of the solvent supply port may be within either the liquid phase region at the bottom of the<br>
polymerization reactor, or the gas phase region that sits above the liquid phase region at<br>
the bottom of the polymerization reactor. If introduction of the solvent and/or molecular<br><br>
-73-<br>
weight reducing agent occurs within the gas phase region, then the supply port is<br>
preferably separated from the venting ports of the polymerization reactor.<br>
The cleaning temperature can be set to an appropriate level by controlling the<br>
temperature of a heater or heating jacket disposed either within the walls of, or within the<br>
interior of, the polymerization reactor that encloses the support, or by providing a heater<br>
or heating medium inside the support and then controlling the temperature of this heater or<br>
medium.<br>
[0163]<br>
The pressure inside the polymerization reactor during cleaning can be set to an<br>
appropriate level by connecting the polymerization reactor to either a pressurization<br>
device or a pressure reduction device.<br>
The temperature and pressure during cleaning are preferably selected in<br>
accordance with the nature of the residual polymer, and the nature of the solvent and/or<br>
molecular weight reducing agent.<br>
[0164]<br>
For example, the temperature is preferably set so that, under the treatment<br>
pressure being used, the atmospheric temperature inside the dissolver is either equal to, or<br>
higher than, the boiling point of at least one of the components of the solvent. By setting<br>
the temperature in this manner, even a small quantity of solvent can be used to generate an<br>
adequate quantity of solvent vapor inside the dissolver, enabling the cleaning to proceed<br>
with favorable efficiency. The solvent vapor is absorbed by the residual polymer and the<br>
like retained on the support, causing the residual polymer to swell, and also generates a<br>
low viscosity solution of the residual polymer and the like which flows down along the<br>
support and accumulates as a solution at the bottom of the polymerization reactor.<br>
However, a portion of the solvent returns to vapor form inside the polymerization reactor<br>
and dissolves more of the residual polymer and the like still retained on the support. The<br>
solvent and/or molecular weight reducing agent does not only act in vapor form, and a<br>
portion also condenses within the upper regions of the polymerization reactor, and then<br><br>
-74-<br>
flows down along the support in liquid form.<br>
[0165]<br>
On the other hand, in order to ensure efficient cleaning, the temperature is<br>
preferably equal to, or higher than, either the glass transition temperature of the residual<br>
polymer or the like undergoing cleaning, or the temperature at which the residual polymer<br>
undergoes crystallization. Moreover, the temperature is preferably set to a high value, but<br>
must be kept below the temperature at which the residual polymer or the like undergoes<br>
thermal degradation.<br>
In order to ensure conditions suitable for generating a vapor of the solvent and/or<br>
molecular weight reducing agent, as well as conditions suited to the nature of the residual<br>
polymer undergoing cleaning treatment (namely, a temperature that is equal to, or higher<br>
than, the glass transition temperature or the polymer crystallization temperature, but no<br>
higher than the temperature at which thermal degradation of the polymer becomes<br>
significant), the pressure is preferably selected from amongst normal pressure, applied<br>
pressure, or reduced pressure in accordance with the properties of the solvent being used.<br>
|0166]<br>
Furthermore, under applied pressure or reduced pressure conditions, one<br>
preferred method involves introducing an inert gas into the polymerization reactor that<br>
exerts no deleterious effects on the polymerization reactor cleaning treatment, so that<br>
oxygen dissolved within the residual polymer or the like and impurities generated during<br>
the cleaning can be removed from the polymerization reactor together with the inert gas.<br>
In order to suppress degradation of the residual polymer, thereby preventing<br>
contamination of the polymerization reactor, the oxygen concentration within the gas<br>
phase portion inside the polymerization reactor is preferably no more than 5% by volume.<br>
In a surprising finding, investigations by the inventors of the present invention<br>
revealed that introduction of an inert gas into the polymerization reactor actually improves<br>
the fluidity of the melted residual polymer and the like flowing down the support, and<br>
particularly in those cases where treatment is conducted under reduced pressure, the<br><br>
-75-<br>
residual polymer undergoes foaming, thereby dramatically increasing the surface area and<br>
significantly improving the renewal process of the residual polymer surface layer, which<br>
enables cleaning to be conducted in an extremely short period of time. The reasons for<br>
these findings are not entirely clear, although it is surmised that the changes in the interior<br>
and surface states of the residual polymer and the like are responsible for the dramatic<br>
increase in the cleaning speed.<br>
[0167]<br>
The inert gas introduced into the system preferably has no deleterious effects on<br>
the resin such as coloration, transformation, or decomposition, and suitable examples<br>
include nitrogen, argon, helium, carbon dioxide, lower hydrocarbon gases, and mixtures<br>
thereof. Nitrogen, argon, helium, or carbon dioxide are preferred as the inert gas, and of<br>
these, in terms of ease of availability, nitrogen is particularly desirable.<br>
The quantity of inert gas introduced in the present invention is preferably within<br>
a range from 0.05 to 100 mg per 1 g of the residual polymer within the polymerization<br>
reactor. By ensuring that the quantity of the inert gas is at least 0.05 mg per 1 g of the<br>
polymer, satisfactory foaming of the resin is achieved, and the treatment effects described<br>
above can be enhanced. On the other hand, restricting the inert gas quantity to no more<br>
than 100 mg facilitates pressure reduction. The quantity of the inert gas is even more<br>
preferably within a range from 0.1 to 50 mg, and most preferably from 0.2 to 10 mg, per 1<br>
g of the polymer.<br>
[0168]<br>
Suitable methods of introducing the inert gas include methods in which the gas is<br>
introduced directly into the polymerization reactor, methods in which the inert gas is<br>
absorbed or incorporated into the polymer in advance, and this absorbed and/or<br>
incorporated gas is then released from the polymer under reduced pressure and thus<br>
introduced into the polymerization reactor, and combinations of these methods. Here, the<br>
term "absorbed" refers to the case in which the inert gas is dissolved within the polymer<br>
and does not exist as gas bubbles, whereas the term "incorporated" means the gas exists as<br><br>
-76-<br>
bubbles within the polymer. In those cases when the inert gas exists as gas bubbles, the<br>
size of these bubbles is preferably as small as possible, and the average gas bubble<br>
diameter is preferably no more than 5 mm, and even more preferably 2 mm or smaller.<br>
[0169]<br>
Cleaning can be conducted by supplying the solvent and/or molecular weight<br>
reducing agent continuously to the polymerization reactor, and then continuously<br>
extracting the solution containing the residual polymer and/or the depolymerization<br>
products of the residual polymer, which accumulates at the bottom of the polymerization<br>
reactor having flowed down along the support, but can also be conducted by introducing a<br>
quantity of the solvent and/or molecular weight reducing agent that is small relative to the<br>
volume of the polymerization reactor, holding the solvent and/or molecular weight<br>
reducing agent within the polymerization reactor for a predetermined time to accomplish<br>
cleaning, and then extracting the solution that has accumulated at the bottom of the<br>
polymerization reactor. In the latter case, the supply of the solvent and/or molecular<br>
weight reducing agent, and the extraction of the solution that has accumulated at the<br>
bottom of the polymerization reactor are preferably repeated a plurality of times.<br>
According to a cleaning method of the present invention, the quantity used of the solvent<br>
and/or molecular weight reducing agent need be only very small, meaning cleaning can be<br>
conducted at minimal cost.<br>
Moreover, in the method of the present invention, because the rate of the<br>
depolymerization reaction is very high, the type of depolymerization catalyst required in<br>
conventional cleaning methods is unnecessary.<br>
[0170]<br>
The time required for cleaning according to the present invention refers to the<br>
time from the point when supply of the solvent and/or molecular weight reducing agent to<br>
the polymerization reactor is commenced, through until the point when extraction of the<br>
solution containing the residual polymer and/or the depolymerization products of the<br>
residual polymer from the polymerization reactor is complete, and this time is preferably<br><br>
-77-<br>
within a range from 1 minute to 100 hours, even more preferably from 5 minutes to 20<br><br>
hours, even more preferably from 10 minutes to 10 hours, and most preferably from 20<br>
minutes to 5 hours.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
[0171]<br>
As follows is a description of the present invention based on a series of<br>
examples.<br>
[Example 1]<br>
Using the reactor shown in Figure 1, a PET resin was dissolved, yielding a PET<br>
resin solution.<br>
The PET resin was melted a temperature of 265°C, and using the feed pump (A)<br>
1, was then discharged from the raw material supply port 2 and through the holes of block<br>
A of the perforated plate 3 at a rate of 3.0 g/minute per hole. At the same time,<br>
isophorone was supplied as the solvent, and using the feed pump (B) 1, was discharged<br>
from the raw material supply port 2 and through the holes of block B of the perforated<br>
plate 3 at a rate of 7.0 g/minute per hole.<br>
[0172]<br>
These supplied materials were then caused to flow down along the support at an<br>
atmospheric temperature equal to the discharge temperature, while the PET resin<br>
dissolved in the solvent, and the resulting solution was then discharged from the dissolver<br>
10 using the drainage pump 8.<br>
The polymer solution was allowed to accumulate at the bottom of the dissolver,<br>
and by extracting the polymer solution at a rate that matched the supply rates of the PET<br>
resin and the solvent, continuous dissolution was achieved.<br>
The perforated plate used a plate of thickness of 50 mm containing 14 holes of<br>
diameter 1 mm, wherein these holes were arranged in two parallel rows separated by 70<br>
mm, with each straight row containing 7 holes at a spacing of 10 mm. The holes<br>
belonging to the block A and the holes belonging to the block B were aligned in an<br><br>
-78-<br>
alternating arrangement. The supports were wires with a diameter of 2 mm and a length<br>
of 8 m. and one support was attached and suspended vertically from a point close to each<br>
hole, and wires of diameter 2 mm and length 100 mm were then attached orthogonally<br>
across the suspended wires with a spacing of 100 mm, thus generating a lattice-type<br>
structure. Stainless steel was used as the material for the supports. The polymer<br>
concentration of the thus obtained PET resin was 30% by weight, and no iundissolved<br>
residual PET resin was observed at the bottom of the dissolver.<br>
[0173]<br>
[Example 2]<br>
Using the reactor shown in FIG. 3, flakes of collected waste PET bottles were<br>
melted, and using the feed pump (A) 1, were then supplied from the raw material supply<br>
port 2 to the depolymerization reactor 10, and discharged through the holes of block A of<br>
the perforated plate 3, in a melted state at 255°C and at a rate of 7.0 g/minute per hole.<br>
At the same time, ethylene glycol was supplied as a molecular weight reducing agent, and<br>
using the feed pump (B) 1, was supplied from the raw material supply port 2 to the<br>
depolymerization reactor 10, and discharged through the holes of block B of the<br>
perforated plate 3 at a rate of 2.3 g/minute per hole.<br>
These supplied materials were then caused to flow down along the supports at an<br>
atmospheric temperature equal to the discharge temperature, while depolymerization was<br>
conducted at a reduced pressure of 85,000 Pa, and the resulting reaction product<br>
accumulated in the bottom of the depolymerization reactor, and was discharged from the<br>
depolymerization reactor using the drainage pump 8 at a rate that matched the supply rate<br>
of the depolymerization raw materials (the melted polymer and the molecular weight<br>
reducing agent).<br>
[0174]<br>
The perforated plate used a plate of thickness of 50 mm containing 14 holes of<br>
diameter 1 mm, wherein these holes were arranged in two parallel rows separated by 70<br>
mm, with each straight row containing 7 holes at a spacing of 10 mm. The holes<br><br>
-79-<br>
belonging to the block A and the holes belonging to the block B were aligned in an<br>
alternating arrangement. The supports were wires with a diameter of 2 mm and a length<br>
of 8 m, and one support was attached and suspended vertically from a point close to each<br>
hole, and wires of diameter 2 mm and length 100 mm were then attached orthogonally<br>
across the suspended wires with a spacing of 100 mm, thus generating a lattice-type<br>
structure. Stainless steel was used as the material for the supports.<br>
The residence time within the depolymerization reactor was 15 minutes. The<br>
residence time was calculated as the volume of reactants within the depolymerization<br>
reactor divided by the supply rate. Although heavy foaming of the PET discharged from<br>
the perforated plate during polymerization, and contamination of the nozzle surface<br>
and/or the wall surfaces caused by such heavy foaming were minimal, the falling resin<br>
incorporated large quantities of foam, and exhibited a behavior of rapid flow down the<br>
supports. Furthermore, in this example, although depolymerization was conducted<br>
without the addition of a depolymerization catalyst such as sodium carbonate,<br>
depolymerization was able to be conducted efficiently and within a short period of time.<br>
[0175]<br>
To the liquid recovered from the discharge port were added 0.5 parts of sodium<br>
carbonate as a transesterification reaction catalyst and 100 parts of MeOH, and a<br>
transesterification reaction was then conducted by stirring the liquid at a stirring speed of<br>
100 rpm for one hour, at a liquid temperature of 75°C and under normal pressure<br>
conditions. The resulting mixture of DMT, EG, and MeOH was cooled to 40°C and<br>
filtered through a glass 3G-4 filter. The DMT recovered from the top of the filter was a<br>
white color, and the yield relative to the terephthalic acid component within the PET resin<br>
used as the depolymerization raw material was 97 mol%. This DMT was added to 45<br>
parts of MeOH, washed by heating to 40°C under stirring, and then once again filtered<br>
through a glass filter. This washing process was repeated twice.<br>
[0176]<br>
The DMT trapped on top of the filter was placed in a distillation reactor and<br><br>
-80-<br>
subjected to reduced pressure distillation at a pressure of 6.65 kPa, and DMT was<br>
collected as the distillate. 40 parts of the distillation-purified DMT was placed in a<br>
separable flask with 75 parts of EG, and when the temperature was raised with constant<br>
stirring at 100 rpm, MeOH was generated at a temperature in the vicinity of 200°C<br>
confirming reaction initiation. An operation was then conducted in which the distilled<br>
MeOH was removed from the system using two separating columns, whereas the<br>
accompanying EG and DMT fractions were returned to the flask. This operation was<br>
repeatedly conducted until the temperature inside the flask reached a temperature of 220<br>
to 250°C, which was taken as the reaction end point. When the composition of the<br>
resulting mixture was analyzed by gas chromatography, it was found that the DMT had<br>
been completely consumed by the reaction, and no reaction by-products were detected.<br>
A combination of this analysis and GPC confirmed a BHET quantity of 44% by weight.<br>
The remaining components each exhibited a sharp molecular weight distribution, and<br>
were all confirmed as being linear dimers through pentamers, and lower oligomers.<br>
[0177]<br>
[Comparative Example 1]<br>
A conventional stirred tank-type PET resin depolymerization reactor was<br>
charged with 200 parts of EG and 50 parts of a PET resin, and the temperature was raised<br>
to 185°C under stirring at 100 rpm. Under these conditions, 4 hours were required to<br>
complete the depolymerization reaction.<br>
To the thus obtained depolymerization product were added 0.5 parts of sodium<br>
carbonate as a transesterification reaction catalyst and 100 parts of MeOH, and a<br>
transesterification reaction was then conducted by stirring the liquid at a stirring speed of<br>
100 rpm for one hour, at a liquid temperature of 75°C and under normal pressure<br>
conditions.<br>
The resulting mixture of DMT, EG, and MeOH was cooled to 40°C and filtered<br>
through a glass 3G-4 filter. The hue of the DMT recovered from the top of the filter was<br>
darker than that observed in the example 2, and the yield relative to the terephthalic acid<br><br>
-81-<br>
component within the PET resin used as the depolymerization raw material was 83 mol%.<br>
[0178]<br>
[Comparative Example 2]<br>
With the exception of altering the raised temperature to 255° C, a<br>
depolymerization reaction was conducted in the same manner as the comparative<br>
example 1. When the liquid temperature exceeded 185°C, the PET resin fused and<br>
formed aggregates, and 1.5 hours were required to complete the depolymerization<br>
reaction.<br><br>
To the thus obtained depolymerization product were added 0.5 parts of sodium<br>
carbonate as a transesterification reaction catalyst and 100 parts of MeOH, and a<br>
transesterification reaction was then conducted by stirring the liquid at a stirring speed of<br>
100 rpm for one hour, at a liquid temperature of 75°C and under normal pressure<br>
conditions.<br>
The resulting mixture of DMT, EG, and MeOH was cooled to 40°C and filtered<br>
through a glass 3G-4 filter. The hue of the DMT recovered from the top of the filter was<br>
darker than that observed in the example 2, and the yield relative to the terephthalic acid<br>
component within the PET resin used as the depolymerization raw material was 78 mol%.<br>
[0179]<br>
[Example 31<br>
Using the reactor shown in FIG. 7, a PET prepolymer with a limiting viscosity<br>
[η ] of 0.46 dl/g, a carboxyl group quantity at the polymer terminals of 32 meq/kg, and a<br>
crystalline melting point of 260°C was supplied from the raw material supply port 2 to the<br>
polymerization reactor 10 using the feed pump (A) 1, and was discharged through the<br>
holes of block A of the perforated plate 3, in a melted state at 265°C and at a rate of 10<br>
g/minute per hole. At the same time, a prepolymer produced by copolymerizing 4 mol%<br>
of cyclohexanedimethanol with a PET with a limiting viscosity [η] of 0.28 dl/g, a<br>
carboxyl group quantity at the polymer terminals of 30 meq/kg, and a crystalline melting<br>
point of 240° C was supplied from the raw material supply port 2 to the polymerization<br><br>
-82-<br>
reactor 10 using the feed pump (B) 1, and was discharged through the holes of block B of<br>
the perforated plate 3, in a melted state at 265°C and at a rate of 10 g/minute per hole.<br>
These supplied materials were then caused to flow down along the supports at an<br>
atmospheric temperature equal to the discharge temperature, while polymerization was<br>
conducted at a reduced pressure of 65 Pa, and the resulting product was discharged from<br>
the polymerization reactor using the drainage pump 8.<br>
[0180]<br>
The perforated plate used a plate of thickness of 50 mm containing 14 holes of<br>
diameter 1 mm. wherein these holes were arranged in two parallel rows separated by 70<br>
mm, with each straight row containing 7 holes at a spacing of 10 mm. The holes<br>
belonging to the block A and the holes belonging to the block B were aligned in an<br>
alternating arrangement. The supports were wires with a diameter of 2 mm and a length<br>
of 8 m, and one support was attached and suspended vertically from a point close to each<br>
hole, and wires of diameter 2 mm and length 100 mm were then attached orthogonally<br>
across the suspended wires with a spacing of 100 mm, thus generating a lattice-type<br>
structure. Stainless steel was used as the material for the supports.<br>
Each prepolymer was produced by adding 0.04% by weight of diantimony<br>
trioxide and a sufficient weight of trimethyl phosphate to yield a phosphorus atom weight<br>
proportion of 100 ppm. The residence time within the polymerization reactor was 70<br>
minutes. The residence time was calculated as the volume of polymer within the<br>
polymerization reactor divided by the supply rate. Although heavy foaming of the<br>
prepolymer discharged from the perforated plate during polymerization, and<br>
contamination of the nozzle surface and/or the wall surfaces caused by such heavy<br>
foaming were minimal, the falling resin incorporated large quantities of foam, and<br>
exhibited a behavior in which foam balls were generated, which then tumbled down along<br>
the supports.<br>
[0181]<br>
Following completion of the polymerization reaction, residual polycondensation<br><br>
-83-<br>
polymer, polymerization intermediates, raw materials, and modified products thereof<br>
were adhered to the inside of the polymerization reactor.<br>
Next, in order to clean the polymerization reactor, triethylene glycol was<br>
supplied as a molecular weight reducing agent from the raw material supply port 2 to the<br>
polymerization reactor 10 using the feed pump (B) 1, and was introduced through the<br>
holes of block B of the perforated plate 3 in a liquid volume that at normal temperature<br>
and pressure was equivalent to 1% by volume relative to the volume of the polymerization<br>
reactor 10.<br>
The polycondensation polymer, polymerization intermediates, raw materials,<br>
and modified products thereof adhered to the inside of the polymerization reactor were<br>
brought into contact with trimethylene glycol vapor at an atmospheric temperature of<br>
270°C and a reduced pressure of 80,000 Pa, and cleaned for a period of 30 minutes while<br>
flowing down the supports, and the resulting solution of depolymerization products was<br>
extracted from the bottom of the polymerization reactor using the drainage pump 8.<br>
When the polymerization reactor was then opened and inspected, the inside of the reactor<br>
was clean, and exhibited a metallic luster. Furthermore, the solution of the<br>
depolymerization products was uniform and of low viscosity, and was able to be extracted<br>
with ease.<br>
[0182]<br>
[Comparative Example 3]<br>
With the exceptions of using a perforated plate 3 in which the 5 holes of a block<br>
A and the 5 holes of a block B were arranged in alternating circles, and installing pipes<br>
with an inner diameter of 15 cm and a length of 8 m as the supports, so that the<br>
prepolymer discharged from the holes flowed down the inner walls of the pipes, a<br>
polymerization was conducted in the same manner as the example 3. The polymer flow<br>
falling from the bottom end of the pipes was observed through the observation window 4,<br>
but did not contain a large quantity of foam. The product polymer exhibited color<br>
irregularities, and the polymerization degree was low.<br><br>
-84-<br>
Following completion of the polymerization reaction, residual polycondensation<br>
polymer, polymerization intermediates, raw materials, and modified products thereof<br>
were adhered to the inside of the polymerization reactor, and these residual polymers were<br>
also observed dripping gradually from the bottom ends of the pipes.<br>
[0183]<br>
Next, in order to clean the polymerization reactor, triethylene glycol was<br>
supplied as a molecular weight reducing agent from the raw material supply port 2 to the<br>
polymerization reactor 10 using the feed pump (B) 1, and was introduced through the<br>
holes of block B of the perforated plate 3 in a liquid volume that at normal temperature<br>
and pressure was equivalent to 1% by volume relative to the volume of the polymerization<br>
reactor 10.<br>
The polycondensation polymer, polymerization intermediates, raw materials,<br>
and modified products thereof adhered to the inside of the polymerization reactor were<br>
brought into contact with trimethylene glycol vapor at an atmospheric temperature of<br>
270°C and a reduced pressure of 80,000 Pa, and cleaned for a period of 30 minutes while<br>
flowing down the supports, the resulting solution of depolymerization products was<br>
extracted from the bottom of the polymerization reactor using the drainage pump 8, and<br>
the polymerization reactor was then opened and inspected. The inner walls of the<br>
supports showed the remains of individual flows (streak-like remains of yellow-colored<br>
polymer), as well as small quantities of adhered residual polymer owing to the inadequate<br>
nature of the cleaning process. Polymer adhesion was also noticeable in the bottom<br>
portion of the polymerization reactor. Furthermore, the solution of the depolymerization<br>
products was not uniform, and was a mixture of a low viscosity portion and a high<br>
viscosity portion.<br>
These differences in behavior are thought to show that in the comparative<br>
example 3, not only did the residual polymer flow down the inner wall surfaces of the<br>
pipes in individual flows, but the residual polymer also merged to form aggregates,<br>
thereby causing a marked reduction in the depolymerization reaction rate.<br><br>
