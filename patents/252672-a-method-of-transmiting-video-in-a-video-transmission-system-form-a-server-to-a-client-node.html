				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to digital video delivery systems, and more<br>
specifically, to providing snapshots from a digital video stream.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
In recent years, the media industry has expanded its horizons beyond<br>
traditional analog technologies. Numerous systems have been developed<br>
for transmitting video information digitally from one location to be viewed<br>
in real time at another location. One difficulty associated with providing<br>
video data in digital format is the bandwidth required to deliver a high<br>
quality picture in real time. Consequently, many techniques have been<br>
developed for compressing the representation of digital video. However,<br>
the more compressed the digital video stream, the more information that<br>
is lost in the compression process and the lower the quality of the video<br>
image displayed to the viewer.<br>
To compensate for low bandwidth, video may be delivered with fewer<br>
frames for second and/or with less resolution. It is not uncommon for<br>
digital video to be delivered in resolutions that are significantly smaller<br>
than the resolution supported by the device being used to view the video.<br>
For example, real-time video is often delivered in 120 by 160 pixel<br>
resolution, when most digital viewing devices support resolutions of 640<br>
by 480 and above.<br>
Various video compression techniques have been developed. One popular<br>
compression technique is known as wavelet transform, which is<br>
described in many publications including "A VLSI Architecture for Real-<br><br>
Time Hierarchical Encoding/Decoding of Video Using the Wavelet<br>
Transform", Mohan Vishwanath, Chaitali Chakrabarti, ICASSP 1994,<br>
and VLSI Architecture for Discrete Wavelet Transforms", Parhi, Keshab;<br>
Nishitani, Takao IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration<br>
(VLSI) Systems, vol.1, No.2, June 1993. Another popular compression<br>
technique is known as MPEG compression, which follows international<br>
standards: ISO/IEC 13818-1,2,3 (MPEG-2) and ISO/IEC 11172-<br>
1,2,3(MPEG-1). Documents that describe these standards are available<br>
from ISO/IEC Copyright Office Case Postale 56, CH 1211, Geneve 20,<br>
Switzerland.<br>
Different compression techniques require different amounts of<br>
computational power to perform compression. If a video server has<br>
enough computational power, digital video may be compressed during<br>
the delivery of the digital video to a viewer in real time ("on the fly"). If a<br>
video server does not have enough computational power to perform on-<br>
the-fly compression, digital video may be pre-compressed before real-<br>
time delivery of the video begins.<br>
Typically, a video server that delivers digital video that is compressed<br>
on-the-flyj will determine the bandwidth available to send the video to a<br>
particular destination (the "client") before initiating the transmission of<br>
the video. The video server will then select a compression ratio based on<br>
the available bandwidth. For example, a higher compression ratio will be<br>
selected to deliver video to a client that is connected to the server<br>
through a 14.4K baud modem than will be selected to deliver video to a<br>
client that is connected to the server through a 28.8K baud modem. This<br>
compression ratio will typically be in effect for the duration of the delivery<br>
of video to that particular client.<br><br>
A video server that delivers digital video that is pre-compressed may not<br>
be free to adjust the compression ratio of a stream of digital video data<br>
based on the bandwidth to a particular client. Consequently, digital video<br>
that is pre-compressed is often pre-compressed with low-bandwidth<br>
clients in mind. Thus, even high bandwidth clients often receive low-<br>
resolution, low-quality video images.<br>
Often, users would like to be able to create a "snapshot' of the video<br>
image that is being supplied to a client. Forn example, the video may be<br>
of a basketball game and the user may wish to have a snapshot of a Strat<br>
player making a slam dunk. The ability to create snapshots may also be<br>
useful for business situations. For example, it may be desirable to have a<br>
snapshot of a diagram or white board that is momentarily displayed<br>
during a video conference.<br>
Using current technology, such snapshots can be created by performing<br>
a "screen capture" or "screen dump" while the desired image is being<br>
displayed to the viewer. Unfortunately, the size and quality of such<br>
snapshots will be no better than the size and quality of video image as it<br>
is delivered in real time. As explained above, the quality of the real image<br>
is reduced by the constraints imposed by the need to supply the video<br>
image in real time over a narrow bandwidth.<br>
Video capture mechanisms that produce digital photographs from analog<br>
video signals generated from external video devices have been developed.<br>
However, such mechanisms generally do not work with digital input.<br>
Further, such hardware mechanisms do not have to address the quality<br>
limitations associated with the realtime delivery of digital video over<br>
media with limited bandwidths. In addition, such video capture<br><br><br>
mechanisms require the recipient of the photograph to acquire special<br>
additional hardware.<br>
Based on the foregoing, it is clearly desirable to provide a mechanism<br>
that allowsm a user to obtain a snapshot<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
A method and system are provided for delivering video from a client to a<br>
server over a communication medium with a limited bandwidth.<br>
According to one aspect of the invention, an initial image quality that<br>
allows the video to be displayed at the client is determined based on a<br>
predetermined frame rate and the limited bandwidth. Video having the<br>
initial image quality is transmitted to the client. While transmitting the<br>
video to the client, the server receives a message from the client that<br>
indicates selection of a second frame rate that is slower than the<br>
predetermined frame rate. In response to the message from the client,<br>
the server determines a second image quality that allows the video to be<br>
displayed in real time at the client based on the second frame rate and<br>
the limited bandwidth. Th second image quality is higher than the initial<br>
image quality. The video with the second image quality is then<br>
transmitted to the client.<br>
According to another aspect of tbe invention, a stream of video is<br>
transmitted from the server to the client. A predetermined user input is<br>
received at the client. In response to the predetermined user input at the<br>
client, a message is transmitted from the client to the server that<br>
indicates a particular frame in the video. In response to receiving the<br><br>
message at the server, the server transmits to the client data depicting<br>
an image represented in the frame, wherein the data represents the<br>
image in greater detail than the image is represented in the frame of the<br>
video.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
A method and apparatus for providing high quality snapshots that<br>
correspond to frames from a lower-quality video stream is described. In-<br><br>
the following description, for the purposes of explanation, numerous<br>
specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding<br>
of the present invention. It will be apparent, however, to one skilled in<br>
the art that the present invention may be practiced without these specific<br>
details. In other instances, well-known structures and devices are shown<br>
in block diagram form in order to avoid unnecessarily obscuring the<br>
present invention.<br>
HARDWARE OVERVIEW<br>
The present invention is not limited to any particular type of digital video<br>
format. Therefore, embodiments of the invention will be described for<br>
both on-the-fly and pre-compressed digital video delivery system. An<br>
exemplary video display system that uses on-the-fly compression is<br>
illustrated in FIG. 1A, while an exemplary video display system that<br>
delivers pre-compressed video data is illustrated in FIG. 1B.<br>
ON-THE-FLY VIDEO DELIVERY SYSTEMS<br>
Referring to FIG. 1A, it is a block diagram of a digital video delivery<br>
system 100 upon which an embodiment of the present invention can be<br>
implemented. System 100 includes a server 102 and a client 110. Server<br>
102 generally includes a storage device 124 and a video encoder 106.<br>
Strorage device 124 stores a video file 104. Video encoder 106 encodes<br>
video into a digital stream using on-the-fly compression, and therefore<br>
includes a video compressor 120.<br>
Server 102 is coupled to client 110 through a communication medium<br>
that supports the transport of digital data. Server 102 may be, for<br><br>
example, a web server on the internet and client 110 may be connected<br>
to the internet through a dial-up connection. Alternatively, server 102<br>
and client 110 may both be workstations on a local area network. The<br>
present invention is not limited to any particular communication<br>
medium or network environment.<br>
Client 110 generally includes a video display 112, a video decoder 108, a<br>
processor 122 and a user input device 118. Video display 112 generally<br>
represents any device capable of displaying digital information. Video<br>
decoder 108 is configured to decode a digital video stream and display<br>
the resulting video images on video display 112. In an Internet or<br>
Intranet environment, video decoder 108 may be, for example,<br>
implemented in an HTTP client, commonly referred to as a "web<br>
browser". Decoder 108 may be coded as part of the web browser itself, or<br>
may be implemented as a "plug in" that is dynamically linked to a web<br>
browser.<br>
In FIG. 1A, video decoder 108 is encoding the digital video stream<br>
received from video encoder 106 and transmitting a signal to video<br>
display 112 to cause a video image 114 decoded from the video stream to<br>
be displayed on video display 112.<br>
Processor 122 generally represents one or more processors that belong to<br>
client 110. Processor 122 executes sequences of instructions contained<br>
in the dynamic memory of client 110. For the purposes of explanation,<br>
video decoder 108 is shown separate from processor 122. However, video<br>
decoder 108 may be implemented in hardware, software or a<br>
combination of hardware and software. When implemented by software,<br><br>
the functions of video decoder 108 may be performed by causing<br>
processor 122 to execute sequences of instructions for decoding a video<br>
stream.<br>
User input device 118 generally represents one or more devices for<br>
receiving input from a user. For example, user input device 118 may<br>
include a keyboard, a mouse, a track-ball, a touch pad, and/or a pen<br>
input device. In response to user input from the user input device 118,<br>
processor 122 may cause a cursor to move on video display 112. By<br>
manipulating user input device 118, a user may interact with user<br>
interface controls 116 generated on video display by processor 122.<br>
USER INTERFACE CONTROLS<br>
As mentioned above, processor 122 executes instructions which cause<br>
user interface controls 116 to be displayed on video display 112.<br>
According to one embodiment of the invention, the user interface controls<br>
116 generated by processor 122 include controls similar to those found<br>
on a video cassette recorder. Such controls may include, for example, a<br>
forward button, a rewind button, a slow button, a pause button, and a<br>
slow motion button. A user interacts with these control using user input<br>
device 118. As shall be described in greater detail hereafter, processor<br>
122 transmits messages to server 102 that affect the encoding of the<br>
video stream in response to certain user interactions with the user<br>
interface controls 116.<br><br>
MAXIMIZING BANDWIDTH USAGE DURING SLOW MOTION<br>
According to one embodiment of the invention, server 102 initially<br>
determines the compression ratio that video compressor 120 will use to<br>
deliver the video contained in video file 104 to client 110 based on a<br>
specified frame delivery rate and the bandwidth between server 102 and<br>
client 10. The lower the bandwidth, the higher the compression ratio<br>
used by video compressor 120 and the lower the quality of the video<br>
image 114 displayed on video display 112.<br>
When the user enters user input through user input device 118 that<br>
elects the "slow" button displayed in the user interface controls 116,<br>
processor 122 transmits a message to server 102 that indicates a new<br>
frame transmission rate. In prior art video delivery systems, the video<br>
encoder would simply respond by sending data at a slower rate.<br>
Consequently, the bandwidth that is fully utilized during normal rate<br>
playback is under utilized during slow speed playback.<br>
According to an embodiment of the present invention, the video encoder<br>
106 dynamically adjusts the compression rate used by video compressor<br>
120 during slow playback to fully utilize the available bandwidth to client<br>
110. The slower the frame rate specified by the user, the lower the<br>
compression ratio employed by the video encoder. Consequently, a higher<br>
quality image will be displayed on video displayed on video display 112<br>
during slow motion playback.<br>
When a user selects the "pause" button on the user interface controls<br>
116, the client pauses playback of the video. The user may select a<br>
"camera" control to obtain a high quality digital image of the frame<br><br>
currently being displayed, as shall be described in greater detail<br>
hereafter.<br>
PROVIDING HIGH QUALITY SNAPSHOTS<br>
According to one embodiment of the invention, user interface controls<br>
116 include a button that depicts a camera. When a user selects the<br>
camera button, processor 122 transmits a message to server 102 to<br>
indicate that the camera button was selected. The message also includes<br>
data that identifies the particular frame displayed in video image 114<br>
when the camera button was selected. The frame may be identified, for<br>
example, by a frame number or by an offset value into the video file 104.<br>
The value used to identify each frame is contained within the video<br>
stream transmitted from server 102. The present invention is not limited<br>
to any particular format in which to represent the displayed frame.<br>
In response to the message from client 110, video compressor 120<br>
locates the frame specified in the message and transmits the video<br>
information that corresponds to the frame from video file 104 with little<br>
or no compression. Consequently, the client 110 will receive a still<br>
"snapshot" of the specified frame that has a much higher resolution and<br>
quality than when the same frame was delivered to client 110 in real<br>
time. For example, the resolution of the video sent during normal speed<br>
realtime playback may be 160 by 120 pixels, while the resolution of the<br>
image sent when camera button is selected may be 640 by 480 pixels.<br>
According to one embodiment, the user will receive a still frame of the<br>
highest quality that can be produced by video file 104, which may itself<br>
store the video in a slightly compressed format. According to an<br><br>
server 132 and client 110. The lower the bandwidth, the higher the<br>
compression ratio of the video file selected by video transmitter 136 and<br>
the lower the quality of the video image 114 displayed on video display<br>
112.<br>
For the purposes of explanation, it shall be assumed that the bandwidth<br>
between server 132 and client 110 is such that only the highly<br>
compressed video file 134 can be delivered in real-time. Therefore, video<br>
selector 130 initially selects video file 134, and video transmitter 136<br>
begins the transmission of data from video file 134.<br>
When the user enters user input through user input device 118 that<br>
selects the "slow" button displayed in the user interface controls 116,<br>
processor 122 transmits a message to server 132 that indicates a new<br>
frame transmission rate. Upon receiving the new frame transmission<br>
rate, video transmitter 136 determines whether data from any less<br>
compressed video file can be delivered in real-time at the slower frame<br>
transmission rate. If data from the less-compressed video file can be<br>
transmitted at the slower frame transmission rate, video selector 130<br>
switches to the less-compressed video file. Video transmitter 136 then<br>
proceeds to transmit a video stream from the less-compressed video file.<br>
Consequently, a higher quality image will be displayed on video display<br>
112 during slow motion play back.<br>
Preferably, switching the input file at the server 132 does not cause a<br>
skip in the video as it is viewed at client 110. Therefore, server 132 stores<br>
data that indicates the correlation between the frames in video file 134<br>
and the frames in video file 140. When video selector 130 switches from<br><br>
alternative embodiment, the user provided controls for specifying the<br>
quality of the snapshot. Because the frame delivery rate is or becomes<br>
zero when the camera button is selected, the quality and resolution of<br>
the image sent in response to selection of the camera button may be<br>
selected independent of the bandwidth between the server and the client.<br>
NON-HIERARCHICAL VIDEO DELIVERY SYSTEMS<br>
FIG. 1B is a block diagram of a digital video delivery system 150 that<br>
includes a server 132 and client 110. Video server 132 includes a video<br>
transmitter 136 for transmitting a video stream that has been pre-<br>
compressed using, for example, MPEG-2 compression techniques. Video<br>
server 132 further includes a storage 144 that contains multiple versions<br>
of a video. In the illustrated example, storage 144 contains a video file<br>
134 that has been pre-compressed using one compression ratio, and a<br>
second video file 140 that has been pre-compressed using a different,<br>
lower compression ratio. Because video file 140 has been compressed<br>
with a lower compression ratio than video file 134, the images<br>
represented in video file 140 have a higher resolution and higher<br>
resolution and higher quality than the corresponding images represented<br>
in video file 134. However, the amount of data contained in video file 140<br>
is too great relative to the bandwidth between server 132 and client 110<br>
for video file 140 to be viewed at client 110 in real-time.<br>
According to an embodiment of the invention, server 132 is configured to<br>
switch between video file sources to provide increased quality slow<br>
motion and high quality snapshots. Specifically, server 132 initially<br>
determines which of video files 134 and 140 to transmit to client 110<br>
based on a specified frame delivery rate and the bandwidth between<br><br>
video file 134 to video file 140, video transmitter 106 begins transmission<br>
from video file 140 at a frame that corresponds to the last frame sent<br>
from video file 134.<br>
When a user selects a button to switch from slow motion to normal speed<br>
playback, a message is sent to server 132. In response to the message,<br>
video selector 130 switches to the more highly compressed video file 134.<br>
The data indicating the correlation between the frames of video files 134<br>
and 140 are again accessed to determine the appropriate frame at which<br>
to begin transmission from video file 134.<br>
When a user selects the "pause" button on the user interface controls<br>
116, the client pauses playback of the video. When a user selects the<br>
camera button, processor 122 transmits a message to server 132 to<br>
indicate that the camera button was selected. The message also includes<br>
data that identifies the particular frame displayed in video image 114<br>
when the camera button was selected. In response to the message from<br>
client 110, video selector 130 locates the frame within the least-<br>
compressed video file that corresponds to the frame specified in the<br>
message. Video transmitter 106 then transmits the video information<br>
that corresponds to the frame from the least-compressed video file.<br>
Consequently, the client 110 will receive a still "snapshot" of the specified<br>
frame that has a much higher resolution and quality than when the<br>
same frame was delivered to client 110 in real time.<br>
Preferably, video files 134 and 140 are compressed using a compression<br>
technique that allows a user to scroll through the compressed video<br>
bidirectionally. Under these conditions, a user may operate the user<br>
interface controls 116 to move through the video sequence both forward<br><br>
and back, with slow motion and pause controls to find the exact frame<br>
desired for a snapshot. A high resolution version of that frame is then<br>
sent to the client 110 when the camera button is selected, as explained<br>
above.<br>
In the foregoing description, storage 144 includes only two versions of<br>
the video being viewed at the client 110. However, storage 144 may<br>
include any number of versions, each of which is pre-compressed using a<br>
different compression ratio. Under these conditions, video selector 130<br>
selects the video file with the lowest compression ratio that can be<br>
transmitted over the available bandwidth at the specified frame display<br>
rate. As the user decreases the frame rate during playback, the video<br>
selector dynamically switches to video files with lower compression<br>
ratios. According to one embodiment, the video file with the lowest<br>
compression ratio is always used to transmit a snapshot back to the<br>
client 110 in response to selection of the camera button.<br>
DIGITAL VIDEO DELIVERY OPERATION<br>
FIGS. 2A, 2B, and 2C contain a flow chart that illustrates the steps<br>
performed by a digital video delivery system according to an embodiment<br>
of the invention that uses on-the-fly compression. Block 200 generally<br>
represents digital video data stored on a storage device of a video server.<br>
The digital data may be uncompressed or pre-compressed. However, if<br>
the video data is pre-compressed, it is not pre-compressed to the degree<br>
required to be able to transmit the video to a client for normal-speed<br>
playback in real time. Consequently, some additional on-the-fly<br>
compression must be performed to send the video to the client for<br>
normal-speed, real-time playback.<br><br>
At step 202, the server receives a request to begin streaming video to a<br>
client. From step 202, control proceeds to block 204. Block 204 generally<br>
represents a steady state in which the video data is compressed (step<br>
206), sent to the client (step 208),decoded at the client (step 210) and<br>
displayed at the client (step 212). The compression ratio (X: 1) used to<br>
compress the data at step 206 is determined based on the bandwidth<br>
between the server and the client and a specific frame transmission rate.<br>
Specifically, the compression must be such that the bandwidth is able to<br>
carry video to the server at the specified frame rate. The on-the-fly<br>
compression ratio will be less for video data that has been pre-<br>
compressed.<br>
At step 214, the server receives a message from the client that indicates<br>
that a user at the client has selected a control on the VCR-like user<br>
interface controls displayed on the client. If the message indicates that a<br>
user has selected a fast forward or rewind control, control passes to step<br>
236. If the message indicates that the user has selected something other<br>
than a fast forward or rewind control, control passes to step 216.<br>
At step 216, it is determined whether the message indicated that the<br>
user selected a "video snap" control. Selection of the video snap control<br>
indicates that the user desires a quality snapshot of the video currently<br>
being viewed by the user. If the message indicates that the user has<br>
selected the video snap control, control passes to step 218. Otherwise,<br>
control passes back to step 202.<br>
At step 218, the server pauses the transmission of video to the client. At<br>
step 220, the video data that is stored on the server is accessed to<br>
acquire the video data for the frame currently displayed at the client.<br><br>
However, the retrieved video data is not compressed using the same<br>
compression ratio X:l as was used at step 206. Rather, at step 222 the<br>
retrieved video data for the selected frame is compressed using a<br>
compression ratio X/Y:l, where Y&gt;1. Consequently, the image<br>
represented in the video data will have a higher image quality and<br>
resolution than the corresponding image that was sent to the user in the<br>
real-time video stream.<br>
According to one embodiment, the user at the client is able to specify<br>
options relating to the quality of the images that will be generated in<br>
response to selection of the video snap control. The message sent to the<br>
server when the user selects the video snap control contains data that<br>
indicates the selected quality. The selected quality is then used to select<br>
the compression ratio used at step 222. The user may specify the quality<br>
in a variety of ways, including specifying a desired resolution or a desired<br>
resolution or a desired compression ratio. The present invention is not<br>
limited to any particular form o specifying the image quality of<br>
snapshots.<br>
At step 224, the less-compressed (or uncompressed) data for the selected<br>
frame of video is transmitted from the server to the client. At step 228,<br>
the high resolution image is decoded at the client from the less-<br>
compressed video data and displayed at the client. Control then proceeds<br>
to step 250.<br>
At step 230, the user may convert ("transcode") the high resolution<br>
snapshot to a specified image format, such as JPEG, PCX, BMG, TIFF,<br>
etc. If the user transcodes the image, the image is converted to the<br><br>
appropriate format at step 232 and saved at step 234. This process may<br>
be repeated to create any number of stored copies of the image.<br>
As mentioned above, control passes to step 236 when the user has<br>
selected either fast forward or rewind. At steps 236 and 238 the server<br>
accesses the appropriate files on the stored data. In addition, the<br>
compression ratio and the frame transmission rate are adjusted as<br>
appropriate to the specified operation. Control then proceeds to the<br>
encode/decode cycle illustrated at block 204.<br>
For digital video distribution systems that transmit video that has been<br>
pre-compressed, the steps are only slightly changed. Specifically, at step<br>
206 a source video-file is selected based on the pre-compression ratio of<br>
the video file and the bandwidth available to transmit the video to the<br>
client. At step 222, a video file that is pre-compressed with a lower pre-<br>
compression ratio than the video file selected at step 206 is selected.<br>
Data from that less-compressed file is transmitted at step 224.<br>
In the foregoing specification, the invention has been described with<br>
reference to specific embodiments thereof. It will, however, be evident<br>
that various modifications and changes may be made thereto without<br>
departing from the broader spirit and scope of the invention. The<br>
specification and drawings are, accordingly, to be regarded in an<br>
illustrative rather than a restrictive sense.<br><br>
