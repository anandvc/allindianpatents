				<td>Background<br>
This invention relates generally to method and system for enhanced television<br>
broadcasts.<br>
In enhanced television broadcasts cr interactive<br>
 television, television content may be distributed together<br>
with references to enhancements. These enhancements may be<br>
hypertext markup language documents including advertising,<br>
additional information related to the programming content,<br>
or other information. In some instances, the user can link<br>
 to the enhancement by mouse clicking on an appropriate icon<br>
on the screen display associated with the television<br>
program.<br>
The distribution of enhanced television content may<br>
initially involve the transmission of content by a head-end<br>
 cr server. The content may be transmitted directly to a<br>
plurality of receivers or it may be transmitted to an<br>
intervening network operating center that thereafter<br>
transmits the information to the appropriate receivers.<br>
Thus, it is important to match each enhancement to a<br>
 particular network or channel identifier associated with<br>
particular programming at particular times.<br>
One way of matching enhancements to programs is to<br>
provide a back channel so that an entity receiving an<br>
enhanced television broadcast may access information that<br>
 correlates the enhancements to channels or network<br>
identifiers. However, such techniques unnecessarily waste<br>
bandwidth and require the presence of a back channel<br>
connection such as a telephone or Internet connection.<br>
Moreover, in many cases, the channel assignments in one<br>
 locality do not correspond to those in other localities.<br>
For example, in the United States, in one locality channel<br>
two may be a CBS network channel and in another locality<br>
channel two may be an NBC channel. Users generally think it<br>
terms of channels.<br>
Therefore, the network identifiers that identify the<br>
network source of a multisource transmission need to be<br>
correlated to particular channels just like the enhancements<br>
must be correlated to particular channels or network<br>
identifiers. In some cases, it may be important to<br>
rearrange the correlation between network identifiers,<br>
channels and enhancements. Currently, no technique is known<br>
to exist for accomplishing this function.<br>
Thus, there is a need for better ways to match<br>
enhancements to particular networks or channels.<br><br>

Detailed Description<br>
Referring to Figure 1, a head-end or server 12 may<br>
distribute television programming to a plurality of<br>
receivers. The programming may originate from one or more<br>
networks or other providers of television content. This<br>
content may be accompanied by enhancements or the<br>
enhancements may be received from separate enhancement<br>
providers.<br>
At various times, the enhanced television content may<br>
be broadcast or distributed by the head-end 12 to the<br>
receivers 20 either directly or via intervening network<br>
operating centers 16. Where network operating centers 16<br>
are utilized, a transport 14 may couple the head-end 12 and<br>
one or more network operating centers 16. In one example,<br>
the network operating centers 16 may be local content<br>
retransmitters that service particular geographic areas .<br>
The transport 14 may be one of a variety of transports<br>
for distributing either analog or digital enhanced<br>
television content. Examples of such transports include<br>
these utilized in connection with cable, satellite and<br>
airwave broadcast systems.<br>
The network operating center 16 may be a processor-<br>
based system coupled to a storage device 22 such as hard<br>
disk drive. The storage device 22 may store software 24 and<br>
34 for matching enhancements to network identifiers and for<br>
remapping the assignments of particular channels ana session<br>
identifiers.<br>
Session identiriers may be part of the announcement<br>
stream received from the head-end 12 by a network operating<br>
center 16. That announcement stream may be in accordance<br>
with the Advanced Television Enhancement Form (ATVEF)<br>
specification in accordance with one embodiment of the<br>
present invention. See the ATVEF Content Specification,<br>
Version 1.1 r.26 (1999). A session identifier or sid<br>
correlates an enhancement to television content. In<br>
general, session identifiers identify an announcement for a<br>
particular broadcast and the announcement in turn identifies<br>
particular enhancements that correlate to particular<br>
television programs. Of course, the enhancements and the<br>
television programs may be broadcast over the sane or<br>
different transports at the same or different times .<br>
The network operating centers 16 may then distribute<br>
the enhanced television content over a transport 13 to a<br>
plurality of receivers 20. The transport 18 nay be the same<br>
transport utilized between the head-end 12 and the network<br>
operating center 16 or completely different technologies may<br>
be used.<br>
The receiver 20 may be a processor-based system such as<br>
a desktop computer, a handheld computer, a processor-based<br>
appliance such as a set-top box or any of a variety of other<br>
appliances. Each receiver 20 may include a storage 25,<br>
coupled to the receiver 20, storing instructions to enable<br>
the receiver 20 to correlate the session information<br>
received over the transport 18. Thus, the software 24 may<br>
be stored on the storage 2 5 in accordance with one<br>
embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Referring to Figure 2, a session directory or session-<br>
channel map contains the information that enables<br>
information received in an announcement to be correlated to<br>
other necessary information. For example, given a cnannel<br>
and time interval, the session-channel map may provide<br>
information about an enhancement correlated to the<br>
programming on that channel at that time interval. The<br>
enhancement may be identified by a session identifier and a<br>
persion (sidl, verl) in one embodiment of the present:<br>
invention. Similarly, a session identifier and a version<br>
lay be correlated to a channel in a time interval. In<br>
general, given a key or input, the session-channel map<br>
returns a list of values depending on the query received.<br>
In one hypothetical example, a grid or electronic<br>
programming guide of program times across the horizontal<br>
axis and channels extending down the left, vertical margin<br>
enable one to correlate particular channels and times with<br>
particular enhancements as illustrated in Figure 3. An<br>
enhancement, identified by a session identifier sid2ii, ver.<br>
2vi, may relate to the program on channel two from seven til<br>
nine o"clock. Thus, Figure 3 visually indicates the<br>
information that is actually provided by a session-channel<br>
map of the type illustrated in Figure 2.<br>
Referring to Figure 4A, a channel-session map<br>
correlates a given channel number to a session identifier or<br>
sid. Within a broadcast program time interval from a head-<br>
end 12 or a network operating center 16, one or more<br>
channels may have associated enhancements. Specific<br>
enhancement content may net yet be available to the<br>
receiving "device, be it a receiver 20 or a network operating<br>
center 16.<br>
Similarly, in the embodiment shown in Figure 43,<br>
instead of correlating channel numbers to session<br>
identifiers, a network identifier is utilised. The network<br>
identifier associates the enhancement with a particular<br>
network such as the American Broadcasting Company or ABC.<br>
The embodiment shown in Figure 4B may be used with<br>
broadcasts that extend over several geographic areas, each-<br>
using different channels for the same networks. Having<br>
received the network identifier, it is thereafter possible<br>
to correlate, within any given locality, to the appropriate<br>
local channel number for that network identifier.<br>
As the announcements for different enhancement sessions<br>
begin to be received, the session-channel map, shown for<br>
example in Figure 4A, begins to fill-up with additional<br>
information or links so that enhancement specific<br>
information may then be made available. Thus, referring to<br>
Figure 5, a particular channel such as channel number two<br>
may have a particular session identifier and a particular<br>
version. However, in this case, the particular receiver 20<br>
or network operating center 16 has still not received any<br>
information for the channel number six.<br>
The same type of session-channel map can be utilised in<br>
an embodiment using a network identifier corresponding to<br>
Figure 4B. The version identification may be obtained from<br>
a session description protocol (SDF) which may be broadcast<br>
from the head-end 12. The session description protocol is<br>
set forth for example in the Request for Comments (RFC) 2327<br>
available from the Network Working Group and dated April<br>
1998. Thus, the version together with the session<br>
identifier may identify a particular enhancement.<br>
Figure 6 shows the channel-session map of Figure 4A<br>
after it has been remapped, for example by a network<br>
operating center 16, to correlate to the channel assignments<br>
of a particular locality. Thus, channel two has now become<br>
channel eight and channel eight now has the session<br>
identifier formerly associated with channel two (as received<br>
from the head-end 12). Similar conversions may be done for<br>
other channel numbers. The same approach may be utilized in<br>
a system in which network identifiers are provided. In such<br>
case, the network identifiers may be converted to local<br>
channel numbers. In some cases, particular channels may be<br>
remapped to other channel numbers by the network operating<br>
center 16 or particular channels may be removed since a<br>
particular network operating center 11 may not choose to<br>
rebroadcast a particular channel.<br>
Instead of accessing the needed tables over a back<br>
channel or using other techniques, a session-channel map,<br>
such as the one shown in Figure 4A, may be broadcast from<br>
the head-end to the network operating center 16.<br>
Thereafter, that map may simply be remapped locally (i.e.,<br>
at the network operating center 16) to correlate to the<br>
appropriate local information. The information needed to<br>
remap the originally broadcast map may be obtained locally<br>
from a storage associated with a network operating center<br>
16.<br>
Thus, an object oriented design in the form of a<br>
session-channel map may provide a pluggable framework<br>
component that may be modified to meet evolving standards<br>
and differences in the enhancement announcement schemes.<br>
The assignment of particular enhancements to particular<br>
networks or channels may be readily varied at the receiving<br>
end to achieve local requirements.<br>
Turning to Figure 7, the session-channel mapping<br>
software 24 resident on a network operating center 16 begins<br>
by determining whether content has been received that<br>
includes an announcement as determined in diamond 28. If<br>
so, the channels (or network identifiers), session<br>
identifiers and versions may be extracted as indicated in<br>
block 30. This information may then be utilized to populate<br>
a session-channel map of the type shown for example in<br>
Figure 6. Similarlv, the flow shown in Figure 7 may be<br>
utilized by a receiver 20 to create a map of the type shown<br>
in Figure 5 for example.<br>
A network operating center 16 may use the channel<br>
remapping software 34, shown in Figure 8, to reassign<br>
particular enhancements to particular channels. Upon<br>
receipt of a remapping request, as indicated in block 36,<br>
the software 34 receives the channel replacements as<br>
indicated in block 38. The session identifiers of the<br>
replacements are matched to the new channels as indicated in<br>
block 40. A new session-channel map is then populated as<br>
indicated in block 42.<br>
Any unused enhancements may be deleted from the map if<br>
so opted for as indicated in diamond 44. For example, if a<br>
flag is set, unused enhancements may be deleted<br>
automatically as indicated in block 46. Otherwise, the<br>
unused enhancements may simply remain even though they may<br>
never be selected by the final receiver. The flag setting<br>
may be user selectable via a graphical user interface.<br>
While the present invention has been described with<br>
respect to a limited number of embodiments, those skilled in<br>
the art will appreciate numerous modifications and<br>
variations therefrom. It is intended that the appended<br>
claims cover all such modifications and variations as fail<br>
within the true spirit and scope of this present invention.<br>
