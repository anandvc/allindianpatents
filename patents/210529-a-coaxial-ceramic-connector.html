				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a coaxial ceramic connector which is primarily proposed to be used in the transducer, has been invented. The coaxial connector of the present invention may be used in the transducer.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is to be understood that the term transducer used herein is taken in its broadest sense and may include electroacoustic, electromechanical transducers, and piezoelectric filters, frequency control devices and the invention may also be used and adapted to various other applications requiring firm and long lasting connection of the two different components, wherein the components may be connected through the device described herein using a cable, particularly electric cable.<br>
As well known in the art the transducer term in broad term is used to convert the electrical energy to mechanical or sound energy and vice versa, as the case may be. Therefore, in the case of electromechanical transducer, which may particularly be made of ceramic material, if the ceramic body is subjected to the applied voltage across the connecting lead, produces a strain or mechanical deformation of the ceramic body, on the other hand, if the ceramic body is subjected to the mechanical stresses, the resulting strain (stress is directly proportional to strain) generates an electrical output appearing as a voltage across the connecting lead.<br>
The operational requirement of the transducer calls for the firm and long lasting connection of the main connecting<br>
Lead with the inner surface of the hemisphere.<br>
The high sensitivity over the wide band of frequencies is always the requirement of the underwater listening devices. Different systems in the form of discs, cylinders etc, do give very high sensitivity, but only over the narrow band of operating frequencies, i.e. one octare below the resonance frequency.<br>
The simplest and cost effective device is a piezeoelectric spherical shell. The spherical nature has three main advantages, i.e. omnidirectionality, high hydrostatic depth capability and very low impedence over the wide range of frequency. Since the resonance frequency constant for spherical body is approximately 1.6 times the hoop mode of cylinder, the operating frequancy band is wider than the cylindrical body.<br>
The main drawback of known transducers, is that, the connectioning of the elements of known transducers is highly complex problem, which inturn is due to the connections required to be done at many points in the main transducer device and thus the increasing the number of joints to be soldered and hence the complexity.<br>
Still another main disadvantage of the connectioning system of the known transducer devices, is that, the connection of the main transducer device to the system is done directly through the teflon coated wire passing through a hole in the main body of transducer. This wire is soldered inside of the shell or cylinder and is held through hole in the main body of the transducer with the help of a special adhesive.<br>
Therefore, normally, a hole on the side of the hemisphere gives passage for the teflon wire, which inturn is soldered inside the spherical shell at each hemisphere, and is held with special adhesive as stated herein above.<br>
The drawback of such connections is that, the ceramic to teflon bonding is normally very difficult and it deals off during encapsulation process of the main transducer<br>
assembly.<br>
The further drawback of such known connections of such known transducers is that, such connection arrangement may leads to inaccuracy and fracture of solders of  the wire, if direct fixing of the teflon coated wire inside the hole with adhesive is not proper, accurate and perfect.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVEHTION<br>
The main object of  the present invention is to propose connector means for connecting the cable drawn from   the system with the inside/outside of hemispherical structure of main transducer device or for use in various other devices requiring firm  and long lasting connection of the two different components, wherein the componentsm may bo connected through the device disclosed herein this invetion using a cable, particularly electric cable and to eliminate the problems encountered in the usage of teflon coated wire as stated herein above.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to propose a coaxial connector, which is easy to handle, capable of giving better bonding and is still cost effection.<br>
Still another object of this invention is to propose a coaxial connector, which can form firm connection to any other device with ceramic to ceramic or ceramic to metal or metal to metal or metal to ceramic adhesive.<br>
Still another object of this invention is to propose a novel coaxial connector particularly for a transducer or say for hydrophone, more particularly for elect roacoustic transducer, which is sufficiently small so that, final properties of the transducer or the hydrophone are not altered and is also sufficiently large for the case of handling.<br>
A still further object of this invention is to propose a coaxial connector for tranducer or hydrophone, which can be fixed onto the cut ends of both the hemispheres of the tranducer or hydrophone with any suitable adhesive, i.e. Ceramic to ceramic or ceramic to metal or metal to metal or metal to ceramic adhesive.<br>
Yet another object of this invention is to propose a coaxial connector for tranducer, which can be soldered by small piece of ordinary wire to the inside of the hemispheres, so during moulding, the connector of the presently disclosed invention is not pealed off.<br>
