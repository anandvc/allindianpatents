DESCRIPTION<br>
PROVIDING TRAFFIC INFORMATION RELATING TO A<br>
PREDICTION OF SPEED ON A LINK AND USING THE SAME<br>
1.	TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
This disclosure relates to providing traffic information<br>
relating to a prediction of speed on a link and using the same.<br>
2.	BACKGROUND ART<br>
With the advancement in digital signal processing and<br>
communication technologies, radio and TV broadcasts are being<br>
digitalized. Digital broadcasting enables provision of various<br>
information (e.g., news, stock prices, weather, traffic<br>
information, etc) as well as audio and video content.<br>
3.	DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION<br>
In one general aspect, a method for identifying traffic<br>
information is provided. The method includes receiving traffic<br>
data including a first identifier, information corresponding<br>
to a prediction of travel speed for a particular link, and<br>
information corresponding to a location associated with the<br>
particular link. The first identifier enables a determination<br>
of a type of the information that is included within the<br>
received traffic data. The method also includes determining a<br>
type of information included within the received traffic data<br>
based on the first identifier and determining travel speed<br>
prediction information based on the information included in<br>
the received traffic data only if the first identifier enables<br>
a determination that the received traffic data includes a<br>
prediction related to travel speed. The method further<br>
includes determining location information based on the<br>
information that is included in the received traffic data<br>
1<br><br>
WO 2006/123890<br><br>
PCT/KR2006/001836<br><br>
corresponding to the location associated with the particular<br>
link and identifying traffic information based on the<br>
determined travel speed prediction information and the<br>
determined location information.<br>
Implementations may include one or more additional<br>
features. For instance, determining travel speed prediction<br>
information may include accessing received data reflecting,<br>
among other items, results of measurements made with respect<br>
to traffic previously traversing the link, and computing a<br>
prediction for a future travel speed based on the received<br>
data. Determining travel speed prediction information may<br>
involve accessing information provided within the received<br>
traffic data and recognizing that data as the predicted travel<br>
speed.<br>
The method may also include receiving information<br>
corresponding to a message management structure including<br>
information corresponding to a generation time of information<br>
reflected in the traffic data. The generation time included<br>
within the received message management structure may relate to<br>
a plurality of message component structures that correspond to<br>
more than one of a predicted or current traffic tendency, a<br>
predicted or current amount of traffic, a predicted or current<br>
speed, or a predicted or current time to traverse a particular<br>
link. Each message component structure may further include an<br>
identifier specific to the type of information and the first<br>
identifier may be an identifier, in a message component<br>
structure, specific to the prediction of travel speed for the<br>
particular link. Information corresponding to a chronological<br>
indication associated with the predicted travel speed revealed<br>
by the received information may be received. The chronological<br>
indication may reflect a particular time of day for which the<br>
predicted The chronological indication may be reflected using<br>
the universal time co-ordinated standard.<br>
2<br><br>
WO 2006/123890	PCT/KR2006/001836<br>
The method may also include determining the travel speed<br>
prediction information and the location information in a<br>
single step. The location information may be determined before<br>
the travel speed prediction information is determined.<br>
Receiving traffic data may include decoding the traffic data<br>
such that the received traffic data is decoded traffic data.<br>
Further, in the method, the prediction of travel speed<br>
may reflect an average of more than one indication of travel<br>
speed associated with the link. The prediction of travel speed<br>
may reflect a weighted summation of more than one indication<br>
of travel speed associated with the link. The predicted travel<br>
speed may be reflected in one of kilometers per hour and miles<br>
per hour. Receiving information corresponding to a prediction<br>
of travel speed may include receiving a predicted travel speed<br>
for the link including a text descriptor. The information<br>
corresponding to a prediction of travel speed for a particular<br>
link may reflect the predicted travel speed.<br>
In another general aspect, an apparatus for identifying<br>
traffic information is provided. The apparatus includes an<br>
interface configured to receive traffic data including a first<br>
identifier, information corresponding to a prediction of<br>
travel speed for a particular link, and information<br>
corresponding to a location associated with the particular<br>
link. The first identifier enables a determination of a type<br>
of the information that is included within the received<br>
traffic data. The apparatus also includes a processor<br>
configured to determine a type of information included<br>
within the received traffic data based on the first identifier<br>
and dependent upon whether the first identifier enables a<br>
determination that the received traffic data includes a<br>
prediction related to a travel speed, determine travel speed<br>
prediction information based on the information included in<br>
the received traffic data. The processor is further configured<br>
3<br><br>
WO 2006/123890<br><br>
PCT/KR2006/001836<br><br>
to determine location information based on the information<br>
that is included in the received traffic data corresponding to<br>
the location corresponding to the particular link and identify<br>
traffic information based on the determined travel speed<br>
prediction information and the determined location information.<br>
Implementations may include one or more additional<br>
features. For instance, the processor may be configured to<br>
receive traffic data including information corresponding to a<br>
version number of information reflected in the traffic data.<br>
The version number may be associated with a specific syntax of<br>
the data where any one of multiple syntaxes may be used. The<br>
processor may be configured to receive information<br>
corresponding to a message management structure including<br>
information corresponding to a genera'tion time of information<br>
reflected in the traffic data. The processor may be configured<br>
to receive information corresponding to a data length of the<br>
received data. The processor may be configured to receive the<br>
predicted travel speed reflected as one value in a set of<br>
possible values.<br>
Also, in the apparatus, the processor may be further<br>
configured to determine the prediction of travel speed for a<br>
particular link only if the first identifier reveals that the<br>
traffic data relates to a prediction of travel speed for a<br>
particular link.<br>
In another general aspect, an apparatus for identifying<br>
traffic information is provided. The apparatus includes means<br>
for an interface configured to receive traffic data including<br>
a first identifier, information corresponding to a prediction<br>
of travel speed for a particular link, and information<br>
corresponding to a location associated with the particular<br>
link. The first identifier enables a determination of a type<br>
of the information that is included within the received<br>
traffic data. The apparatus also includes means for<br>
4<br><br>
WO 2006/123890<br><br>
PCT/KR2006/001836<br><br>
determining a type of information included within the received<br>
traffic data based on the first identifier and means for<br>
determining travel speed prediction information based on the<br>
information included in the received traffic data only if the<br>
first identifier enables a determination that the received<br>
traffic data includes a prediction related to a travel speed.<br>
The apparatus further includes means for determining location<br>
information based on the information that is included in the<br>
received traffic data corresponding to the location<br>
corresponding to the particular link and means for identifying<br>
traffic information based on the determined travel speed<br>
prediction information and the determined location information.<br>
The details of one or more implementations are set forth<br>
in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other<br>
features will be apparent from the description and drawings,<br>
and from the claims.<br>

S. MODES FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
One such use for digital broadcasts is to satisfy an<br>
existing demand for traffic information. Proposals that<br>
involve the use of digital broadcasts for this purpose<br>
contemplate the use of standardized formatting of traffic<br>
information to be broadcast. This approach may be used to<br>
enable the use of traffic information receiving terminals made<br>
6<br><br>
WO 2006/123890<br><br>
PCT/KR2006/001836<br><br>
by different manufacturers, which each could be configured to<br>
detect and interpret traffic information broadcast in the same<br>
way.<br>
FIG. 1 is a schematic diagram of a network through which<br>
traffic information is provided. A traffic information<br>
providing server 100 in a broadcast station may transmit<br>
traffic information collected from various sources (e.g.,<br>
operator input, or information received from another server or<br>
probe cars through a network 101) wirelessly so that a traffic<br>
information receiving terminal (e.g., navigation system<br>
installed in a car 200) may receive the traffic information.<br>
As shown in FIG. 2a, the traffic information wirelessly<br>
transmitted from the traffic information providing server 100<br>
may be a sequence of TPEG-CTT (transport protocol expert<br>
group-congestion and travel-time Information) messages. A<br>
message segment of the sequence, i.e., a TPEG-CTT message,<br>
whose syntax is shown in FIG. 2b, may include a message<br>
management container 21, a CTT event container (or Application<br>
Event Container) 22, and TPEG-CTT location container 23. The<br>
TPEG-CTT message may also include different type of containers<br>
other than, less than, or in addition to the CTT event<br>
container as in the TPEG-CTT message 30.<br>
The message management container 21 may be used for<br>
managing date and time information. The time information may<br>
include message generation time (e.g., a chronological time<br>
indication). The message generation time may be included in<br>
every TPEG-CTT message when the corresponding message is<br>
transmitted. The CTT event container 22 may include congestion<br>
and travel time status and predicted congestion and travel<br>
time status of links, i.e., road segments. The congestion and<br>
travel time status may include average link speed, link travel<br>
time, link delay, or congestion type, etc.<br>
The TPEG-CTT location container 23 may employ various<br>
7<br><br>
WO 2006/123890<br><br>
PCT/KR2006/001836<br><br>
location reference processes. For example, a Tocation<br>
reference process using a coordinate system or a location<br>
reference process using pre-promised links may be used. When a<br>
coordinate system is used, the coordinates (latitudes and<br>
longitudes) of the start and end positions of a link for which<br>
the TPEG-CTT message is created, may be transmitted. When a<br>
reference process using pre-promised links is used, a unique<br>
identification for a specific link on a receiving device may<br>
be transmitted. For example, a receiving device may include a<br>
locally stored network of links, wherein each link may be<br>
identified by a unique identifier. A link may refer to a road<br>
segment which starts and ends at junctions and has no junction<br>
in between. The coordinate system may be the WGS 84 model. A<br>
text formatted name of the link may be transmitted.<br>
In various implementations, a CTT event container and a<br>
TPEG-CTT location container, as illustrated in FIG. 2c, are<br>
composed of one or more CTT components 201. Each of CTT<br>
components may be constructed according to the syntax shown in<br>
FIG. 2d if it carries congestion status information while it<br>
may be constructed according to the syntax shown in FIG. 2e if<br>
the component carries location information.<br>
A CTT event container 22 may be composed of one component<br>
or a plurality of CTT components. In various implementations,<br>
CTT components including an ID of 80h (notation 'h' means<br>
hexadecimal) or 84h includes one or more status components<br>
including basic traffic information such as the average link<br>
speed, link travel time, link delay, or congestion type. In<br>
the description, specific IDs are described as assignments to<br>
structures associated with specific information. The actual<br>
value of an assigned ID (e.g., 80h) is exemplary, and<br>
different implementations may assign different values for<br>
specific associations or circumstances.<br>
In various implementations, CTT components including an<br>
8<br><br>
WO 2006/123890<br><br>
PCT/KR2006/001836<br><br>
ID of 81h include one or more status components including<br>
predicted CTT status. The predicted CTT status may include<br>
predicted average link speed, predicted link travel time, or<br>
congestion acceleration tendency. The congestion acceleration<br>
tendency may include information indicative of the tendency of<br>
congestion status. The congestion acceleration tendency will<br>
be described as a type of prediction information as the<br>
congestion status in the near future may be predicted from it.<br>
In various implementations, the TPEG-CTT message may<br>
include CTT components structured as FIG. 2f to deliver<br>
additional information of traffic information. As shown, an<br>
identifier 8Ah may be assigned to the CTT component carrying<br>
additional information, and a language code that is indicative<br>
of language used for the additional information may also be<br>
included in the CTT component.<br>
FIG. 3a shows an example of a syntax of the CTT component<br>
included in the CTT event container, which delivers the<br>
current congestion and travel time status. The CTT component<br>
may be assigned an ID 3a including a value of 8Oh or 84h and<br>
may include m status components 3c and a field 3b indicative<br>
of the length of the data included in the status components<br>
included therein, the length being expressed in the unit of<br>
byte. Other units, such as bit, may be used.<br>
The status components 3c may include information on the<br>
average link speed, the link travel time, the link delay,<br>
and/or the congestion type. The syntax, according to one<br>
implementation, of each of which, is shown in FIGS. 3b, 3c, 3d,<br>
and 3e, respectively. In one implementation, status components<br>
delivering the average link speed, the link travel time, the<br>
link delay, and the congestion type are assigned IDs of '00',<br>
'01', '02', and '03', respectively. The link delay may be, for<br>
example, the delay in the time required to pass through the<br>
link under current traffic condition with respect to the time<br>
9<br><br>
WO 2006/123890<br><br>
PCT/KR2006/001836<br><br>
required to pass through the link at a limit speed specified<br>
in the link. The link delay may be expressed in the unit of<br>
minute, second, tens or tenths of seconds, or another unit.<br>
The link delay may be calculated with respect to the average<br>
time required to pass the link on the same days or in the same<br>
time slot. The link delay may enable traffic information<br>
receiving terminals that do not have information on each link<br>
(e.g., speed limit in the link, length of the link, etc) to<br>
expect the time required to pass a link.<br>
FIG. 4a shows an example of a syntax of the CTT component<br>
included in the CTT event container, which delivers the<br>
predicted congestion and travel time status. The CTT component<br>
may be assigned an ID 4a including a value of 81h and may<br>
include m status components 4c and a field 4b indicative of<br>
the length of the data included in the status components<br>
included therein, the length, may be, for example, expressed<br>
in the unit of byte.<br>
The status components 4c may include information on the<br>
predicted average link speed, the predicted link travel time,<br>
and/or, the congestion acceleration tendency, the syntax,<br>
according to one implementation, of each of which, is shown in<br>
FIGS. 4b, 4c, and 4d, respectively. The status components<br>
delivering the predicted average link speed, the predicted<br>
link travel time, and the congestion acceleration tendency may<br>
be assigned IDs of '00', '01', and '02', respectively.<br>
Alternatively, the predicted congestion and travel time<br>
status may be delivered by the CTT component that delivers the<br>
current congestion and travel time status (e.g., average link<br>
speed, link travel time, link delay, congestion type)<br>
including an ID of 80h or 84h. In this case, the status<br>
components delivering the predicted congestion and travel time<br>
status may be assigned IDs different from the IDs of the<br>
status components delivering the current congestion and travel<br>
10<br><br>
WO 2006/123890<br><br>
PCT/KR2006/001836<br><br>
time status.<br>
The server 100 may create predicted status information<br>
shown, according to one implementation, in PIGS. 4b through 4d<br>
based on the traffic information which may be collected from<br>
various sources and/or its own traffic information database,<br>
which will be described in detail below.<br>
To provide predicted traffic information, the server 100<br>
may store the average speed at each link according to day,<br>
time slot, week, month, or year. For example, in one<br>
implementation, the server 100 may store the average speed at<br>
each link at intervals, such as every 30 minutes, as shown in<br>
FIG. 5a. The unit of the values shown in FIG. 5a is km/h,<br>
though other units, such as m/s, may be used.<br>
Additionally, in one implementation, the server 100 may<br>
store the average speed, or other information, such as travel<br>
time or congestion, of links for which the traffic information<br>
is currently provided at intervals for a predetermined period<br>
of time (e.g., 3 hours) and compare the pattern of change in<br>
the average speed for the period of time with the pattern of<br>
change in the same time slot of the same day stored in the<br>
database. For example, if FIG. 5b shows the pattern of change<br>
in the average speed for the past 3 hours from 4:30 pm on a<br>
Monday afternoon (A), the server 100 compares the data with<br>
the average speeds of from 1:30 pm to 4:30 pm stored in the<br>
database (B). If the difference (e.g., the sum of the absolute<br>
values of the difference in average speeds at each<br>
corresponding time or a weighted sum thereof) is less than a<br>
predetermined threshold, the server 100 reads the average<br>
speed B1 at 30 minutes after the current time (i.e., the<br>
average speed at 5:00 pm) from the database and transmits the<br>
value as the predicted average speed in the corresponding link<br>
according to the syntax shown in FIG. 4b. The predicted<br>
average link speed may be expressed in the unit of km/h, for<br>
11<br><br>
WO 2006/123890<br><br>
PCT/KR2006/001836<br><br>
example. The predicted time (e.g., 5:00 pm in the previous<br>
example) may also be transmitted in the form of the syntax<br>
shown in PIG, 4b, for example in UTC (Universal Time<br>
Coordinated) format.<br>
Explaining FIG. 4b in more detail, the predicted time in<br>
UTC format may be indicative of a target time or date in the<br>
future, and the predicted speed indicates average speed (in<br>
km/h, for example) on a link at the target time or date, such<br>
as, a day of year, month of year, year, holiday, time of day,<br>
rush hour, event, morning/afternoon/evening. For example, the<br>
link may be an inter-road between cities, a bridge, or a road<br>
between intersections. The data may be incorporated into the<br>
component in units of a byte unit, and/or it may be<br>
incorporated in units of a bit or a long byte, according to<br>
data size. In addition, the speed may be expressed in various<br>
units, for example, m/sec, mile/hour, etc.<br>
In one implementation, if the calculated difference<br>
exceeds the predetermined threshold, i.e., it is determined<br>
that the pattern of change in the average speed stored in the<br>
database does not match the pattern of change in the measured<br>
average speed, the server 100 may not provide the predicted<br>
average link speed, or alternatively, the server 100 may<br>
estimate the predicted average link speed Al from the average<br>
link speeds extracted for the past 3 hours and provide the<br>
estimated value as the predicted average link speed. Various<br>
processes may be used to estimate the average speed from the<br>
measured average speed values. One process, for example,<br>
involves calculation of a weighted sum which gives the latest<br>
sample value the highest weight and gives the oldest sample<br>
value the lowest weight. For example, the predicted speed Al<br>
in FIG. 5b can be extracted by calculating 0.5 x current speed<br>
+ 0.2 x speed of 30 minutes ago + 0.1 x speed of 1 hour ago +<br>
0.1 x speed of 1.5 hours ago + 0.05 x speed of 2 hours ago +<br>
12<br><br>
WO 2006/123890<br><br>
PCT/KR2006/001836<br><br>
0.05 x 2.5 hours ago, etc.<br>
After calculating the predicted average link speed in the<br>
aforementioned way, the server 100 may calculate the predicted<br>
travel time of each link and transmit the predicted travel<br>
time of each link along with associated predicted time<br>
according to the syntax shown in FIG. 4c. The predicted travel<br>
time may be calculated by multiplying the predicted average<br>
speed at each link by the length of the corresponding link<br>
stored in the database. The predicted travel time may be<br>
expressed in the unit of minutes, tens of seconds, second, or<br>
a unit smaller than seconds, for example.<br>
When providing the average speed in a particular link,<br>
the server 100 may compare the current average speed with the<br>
average speed at the previous time slot and provide the<br>
tendency of change in the average link speeds 41 according to<br>
the syntax shown in FIG. 4d. In one implementation, the<br>
information, which is called the congestion acceleration<br>
tendency, may have one value among several values defined by a<br>
table shown in FIG. 4d. For example, the information may be<br>
assigned 1 if the current average speed is higher than the<br>
average speed of 30 minutes ago. The congestion acceleration<br>
tendency may be assigned 2 if the current average speed is<br>
lower than the average speed of 3 0 minutes ago. The congestion<br>
acceleration tendency may be assigned 3 if the average speed<br>
remains unchanged. If there is no available data to compare,<br>
the congestion acceleration tendency may be assigned 0. The<br>
congestion acceleration tendency information may enable a<br>
driver to choose a route that shows improvement in the traffic<br>
congestion from among several possible routes showing similar<br>
average speeds. Instead of providing the congestion<br>
acceleration tendency in the form of a number (e.g., 1, 2, 3,<br>
etc.), the server 100 may provide the rate of change of the<br>
average speed, i.e., the slope in the graph shown in FIG. 5b<br>
13<br><br>
WO 2006/123890<br><br>
PCT/KR2006/001836<br><br>
as the congestion acceleration tendency, or other indicia or<br>
descriptors.<br>
In one implementation, the server 100 may prevent the<br>
size of information which it should transmit from becoming<br>
excessively large by maintaining the ratio of the current<br>
congestion and travel time status to the predicted congestion<br>
and travel time status below an appropriate level (e.g., 3:1).<br>
FIG. 6 is an example of a block diagram of a navigation<br>
terminal for receiving traffic information transmitted from<br>
the server 100. Figs. 6-8 are example implementations of<br>
systems for receiving and utilizing traffic information, and<br>
interfaces used to output information generated by such<br>
systems. Other systems may be organized differently or include<br>
different components.<br>
As illustrated by Fig. 6, the navigation terminal<br>
includes a tuner 1 for receiving modulated traffic information<br>
signals by resonating at the required frequency band, a<br>
demodulator 2 for outputting traffic information signals by<br>
demodulating the modulated signals from the tuner 1, a TPEG-<br>
CTT decoder 3 for extracting traffic information by decoding<br>
the demodulated traffic information signals, a GPS module 8<br>
for calculating the current position (i.e., latitude,<br>
longitude, and altitude) by receiving signals from a plurality<br>
of low-orbit satellites, storage structure 4 for storing<br>
various graphic data and an electronic map including<br>
information on links and nodes, an input device 9 for<br>
receiving user input, a navigation engine 5 for controlling<br>
screen display based on the user input, the current position,<br>
and extracted traffic information, a memory 5a for storing<br>
data temporarily, an LCD panel 7 for displaying data, and an<br>
LCD drive 6 for driving the LCD panel 7 according to data to<br>
be presented. The input unit 9 may be a touch screen<br>
incorporated into the LCD panel 7.<br>
14<br><br>
WO 2006/123890<br><br>
PCT/KR2006/001836<br><br>
The tuner 1 tunes to the frequency of the signals<br>
transmitted by the server 10 0 and the demodulator 2<br>
demodulates the tuned signals in a predetermined manner. The<br>
TPEG-CTT decoder 3 decodes the demodulated signals into a<br>
TPEG-CTT message sequence as shown in FIG. 2, interprets each<br>
TPEG message included in the TPEG-CTT message sequence, and<br>
sends necessary information and/or control signals to the<br>
navigation engine 5. For purposes of brevity, the following<br>
description focuses on basic congestion and travel time status<br>
shown in FIGS. 3b through 3e and predicted congestion and<br>
travel time status shown in FIGS. 4b through 4d though other<br>
status information is involved, such as, for example, speed,<br>
is involved.<br>
The TPEG-CTT decoder 3 extracts date/time and message<br>
generation time included in the message management container<br>
of each TPEG message and determines if the following container<br>
is a CTT event container based on 'message element'<br>
information (i.e. an identifier). If it is determined that the<br>
following container is a CTT event container, the TPEG-CTT<br>
decoder 3 provides the navigation engine 5 with the<br>
information extracted from the CTT component included in the<br>
CTT event container so that the navigation engine 5 may<br>
display congestion and travel time status and predicted<br>
congestion and travel time status, which will be described<br>
below. Providing the navigation engine 5 with the information<br>
may include determining, based on identifiers, that the<br>
traffic information includes a message management container<br>
including status information within various message components<br>
within the message management container. The components may<br>
each include different status information associated with<br>
different links or locations and identifiers associated with<br>
the different status information. The containers and<br>
components may each include information associated with a<br>
15<br><br>
WO 2006/123890<br><br>
PCT/KR2006/001836<br><br>
generation time, version number, data length, and identifiers<br>
of included information.<br>
The TPEG-CTT decoder 3 then extracts information on the<br>
link location for which the previously extracted information<br>
is intended from the following TPEG-CTT location container.<br>
The position information may be, for example, the coordinates<br>
(i.e., latitudes and longitudes) of the start and end<br>
positions or an ID that is uniquely assigned to each link,<br>
depending on the type of the TPEG-CTT location container. If<br>
the navigation terminal is equipped with the storage structure<br>
4, the navigation engine 5 finds the location of the link for<br>
which the received traffic information is intended with<br>
reference to the information on each link and node stored in<br>
the storage structure 4. The navigation engine 5 may convert<br>
the coordinates of a link into a link ID or vice versa.<br>
The navigation engine 5 reads a part of the electronic<br>
map centered around the position coordinates received from the<br>
GPS module 8 from the storage structure 4 and displays the map<br>
on the LCD panel 7 via the LCD drive 6. A particular graphic<br>
symbol is displayed at the location corresponding to the<br>
current position on the LCD panel 7.<br>
The navigation engine 5 displays the average link speed<br>
received from the TPEG-CTT decoder 3 at a location<br>
corresponding to the coordinates or link ID delivered via the<br>
TPEG-CTT location container following the container delivering<br>
the average link speed. There are various processes for the<br>
navigation engine 5 to display the traffic information. For<br>
example, the navigation engine 5 may show links in different<br>
colors according to the average speed at the links as shown in<br>
FIGS. 7a and 7b, where the colors red, orange, green, and blue<br>
(colors themselves not shown) may be used to indicate average<br>
speeds of 0~10 km, 10~20 km, 20~40 km, over 40 km,<br>
respectively. Alternatively, the navigation engine 5 may show<br>
16<br><br>
WO 2006/123890<br><br>
PCT/KR2006/001836<br><br>
the average link speed in numbers at each link as shown in FIG.<br>
7c, or a combination of colors and numbers may be used. In<br>
addition or as an alternative, the navigation engine 5 may use<br>
similar display tools to display the congestion acceleration<br>
tendency received from the TPEG-CTT decoder 3 at the<br>
corresponding link, or through the use of other display tools<br>
such as through the use of an icon or a string (e.g.,<br>
'improved' if the value of the congestion acceleration<br>
tendency is 1 and 'deteriorated' if the value is 2). In this<br>
case, the navigation engine 5 maintains the status unchanged<br>
if the value of the congestion acceleration tendency is 0 or 3.<br>
If the congestion acceleration tendency is received in the<br>
form of the rate of change of the average speed, the<br>
navigation engine 5 displays the value only when a request<br>
from the user is received to prevent visual confusion of the<br>
user. The rate of change may be displayed together for a user-<br>
chosen route or a front link.<br>
If the navigation terminal is not equipped with the<br>
storage structure 4 for storing an electronic map, the<br>
terminal may show the average link speed at links located in<br>
front of the current position in different colors, as shown in<br>
FIG. 7b, or in numbers, as shown in FIG. 7c. If the route of<br>
the vehicle with the navigation terminal installed is<br>
determined, the navigation terminal may show the average speed<br>
at the links included in the determined route instead of the<br>
links located in front of the current position.<br>
The navigation engine 5, responsive to user input, may<br>
display the link travel time, the link delay, and the<br>
congestion type received from the TPEG-CTT decoder 3 on the<br>
LCD panel 7 instead of or simultaneously with the average link<br>
speed.<br>
If the user requests predicted congestion and travel time<br>
status through the input unit 9, the navigation engine 5<br>
17<br><br>
WO 2006/123890<br><br>
PCT/KR2006/001836<br><br>
displays the predicted average link speed at each link<br>
received from the TPEG-CTT decoder 3 in colors or in numbers<br>
instead of the current average link speed. In this case, the<br>
colors or numbers describing the predicted status may be<br>
displayed simultaneously with the current average link speed<br>
but the location or used colors may be different. If the user<br>
switches the display mode to see the predicted link travel<br>
time instead of the predicted average link speed, the<br>
navigation engine 5 displays the predicted link travel time on<br>
the electronic map or graphics on the LCD panel 7.<br>
If the navigation engine 5 is capable of routing, the<br>
navigation engine 5 may search or research the desirable route<br>
based on the received predicted average link speed or<br>
predicted link travel time. For example, the navigation engine<br>
5 finds the shortest time path to the destination by using the<br>
predicted link average time or predicted link travel time at<br>
each link to be reached 3 0 minutes later at the current speed.<br>
If the terminal in FIG. 6 is equipped with a voice output<br>
capability, the terminal may audibly output the received<br>
predicted status or congestion tendency information for a<br>
specified link or links.<br>
The information and/or control signals received from the<br>
TPEG-CTT decoder 3 are temporarily stored in the rewritable<br>
memory 5a and used by the navigation engine 5. After using the<br>
information stored in the memory 5a, the navigation engine 5<br>
may store the average link speed or link travel time at<br>
intervals of, such as, for example, 20 minutes (e.g., 1:00,<br>
1:20, 1:40) for the last 1 hour. The interval of storage may<br>
differ depending on the storage capacity of the memory 5a. By<br>
automatically expiring the information from within memory, the<br>
system may be assured that it is working with recent<br>
information when consulting the contents of the memory, and<br>
thus may be able to represent information as current with<br>
18<br><br>
WO 2006/123890<br><br>
PCT/KR2006/001836<br><br>
confidence without having to otherwise maintain or check<br>
information reflecting when the stored data was<br>
collected/aggregated/stored.<br>
If a specific link is selected by the user while the<br>
average speed at each link is stored in the memory 5a, the<br>
navigation engine 5 controls the LCD drive 6 so that the<br>
history of the average link speed or the history of the link<br>
travel time at the specified link is displayed as a graph<br>
shown in FIG. 8. In the graph, the unit of the displayed<br>
numbers is km/h and the name 81 of the link is displayed on<br>
the graph. The link name is received along with the<br>
coordinates of the link or link ID through the TPEG location<br>
container 23 or included in the electronic map stored in the<br>
storage structure 4. The current congestion status, predicted<br>
congestion status, or other status may be displayed in other<br>
or different ways.<br>
If the predicted congestion status is not included in the<br>
received traffic information, the navigation engine 5 may<br>
predict the average speed using the current average speed and<br>
the history of the average link speed stored in the memory 5a<br>
and display the predicted average link speed, as shown in FIG.<br>
8a. The method for predicting the average link speed may be<br>
the same as the aforementioned prediction method executed in<br>
the server 100.<br>
While the disclosure has discussed a limited number of<br>
implementations, those skilled in the art having the benefit<br>
of this disclosure will appreciate numerous modifications and<br>
variations therefrom. It is intended that all such<br>
modifications and variations fall within the spirit and scope<br>
of this disclosure.<br>
