				<td>3. Description of invention Field of invention<br>
This invention relates to a process for the preparation of a novel mosquito larvicidnl formulation based on essential oil of the plant 'Patti' Rabdosia melissoides Benth or its phenolic or non-phenolic chemical constituents. It is in the field of pest control through the use of safe plant products.<br>
Background of invention<br>
In view of the various harmful effects of synthetic pesticides (mammalian toxicity, residues, pest resistance, pest resurgence etc.), the use of botanical pesticides is on the increase. Most botanicals are readily biodegradable and are reportedly devoid of the various harmful effects associated with use of the synthetics.<br>
'Patti' Rabdosia melissoides Benth, (synonymous Plectranthus melissoides Bcnth), a wild weed plant which is abundantly available in the Tarai belt of Kumaon hills and other parts of India or elsewhere, has been found to be a source of biologically active materials. The essential oil as well as its various phenolic or non-phenolic constituents such as thymol, para-cymenc etc. obtained from the oil or other sources, are particularly effective against mosquito, for example, the larvae of Cnlex qiiinquefasciatus and others. These materials have a considerable use potential in domestic water air coolers and other situations where water stagnates over time. The present invention reports a process of incorporating these biologically active materials in a suitable formulation such as cmulsifiablc concentrate. In this form, the efficacy of the materials has been enhanced substantially.<br>
Prior art<br>
To the best of information, mosquito larvicidcs based on R. melissoides oil or its phenolic or non-phenolic constituents such as thymol, /wra-cymene and the like are non¬existent in any form.<br>
Objects of the invention<br>
An object of the invention is to propose a process for preparation of novel mosquito larvicidal formulations such as emulsifiable concentrate compositions based on the essential oil of R. melissoides or its phenolic or non-phenolic constituents, particularly thymol and para cymene.<br>
Another objective is to propose use of the developed compositions for control of pests, particularly mosquito larvae.<br>
The invention<br>
According to this invention, there is provided a process for preparation of novel mosquito larvicidal formulations such as emulsifiable concentrate based on the bioactive essential oil of Rabdosia melissoides Benth (Syn. Plcclranlhus melissoides Benth) or its chemical ingredients such as thymol, para cymene, and the likes, obtained from the essential oil or other sources, singularly or in combination, characterized by the dissolution (1-25% w/w) of the active material(s) along with an anionic or non-ionic or blends of ionic, non-ionic or both the ionic and non-ionic surfactants as emulsifier, in a formulation solvent and homogenizing the mix by physical or mechanical means, such as manual or mechanical shaking, stirring or the like, if necessary by slight warming, to yield a homogeneous product in uniform clear solution state, to be used as such or on emulsification in water or added to water bodies to form emulsions, to control pest.<br>
In accordance with this invention, the essential oil of R. melissoides or its phenolic or non-phenolic const ituent(s), particularly thymol or para cymene, is(are) dissolved in either of cyclohcxanone, aromax, iomax, ceeninc, naptha or xylene and the ionic, non-ionic or blends or ionic, non-ionic or the ionic and non-ionic surfactants (such as alkyl aryl sulphonates preferably calcium dodecylbenzene sulphonate, petroleum sulphonates, polyoxyethylenated alkyl phenols preferably nonyl phenols, alkyl aryl ethers, sorbitan or polyoxyethylenated sorbitan esters, polyoxyethylenated vegetable oils and the likes, as exemplified by commercial products such as Tweens, Spans, Hyoxid x 45, Emulsol MA, Atlox 3400 B, Unitox 33x, IGSURF 6000 or their likes), either alone or as blends (9:1 or 1:9), at levels of 1-15% w/w of the final product, are added; the volume made so as to obtain preferably 10-25% w/w of the essential oil/ingredicnt(s) and 5-10% of the surfactant in the final solution. The ingredients are homogenized and if necessary warmed (~ 60"C) to ensure dissolution before making the final volume/ weight to obtain a homogeneous product in a clear solution state.<br>
The product as obtained above is applied at the required concentration as such or on emulsification in water or addition to water bodies to yield emulsions or otherwise to control pest. It lias been found particularly effective in controlling acquatic insect pests such as mosquitoes.<br>
Further objects and advantages of this invention will be more apparent from the ensuing examples.<br>
Examples<br>
Preparation of 25% Emilsifiable Concentrate<br>
Take 25 g of R. melissoides essential oil and dissolve in commercial grade aromax. Add 5 g of Hyoxid x 45 (Aries Agrovet Industries) and mix thoroughly to obtain a homogeneous mass. Make volume with aromax to a final weight of 100 g and mix thoroughly.<br>
Preparation of 10% Kmulsifiable Concentrate<br>
Take 10 g of R. melissoides essential oil or thymol or para cymene or its other ingredients and dissolve in solvent ceenine. Add 10 g of a surfactant comprising of Tween 40 and Span 40 (9:1) and homogenize thoroughly. Add ceenine to make final weight of 100 g and mix thoroughly.<br>
Physico-chemical properties and bioactivity of some recipes<br>
The results on physico-chemical properties and bioactivity of a few selected recipes prepared in laboratory arc given in Table.<br>
