MULTI-SPEED DUAL CLUTCH TRANSMISSION<br>
CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
[0001] This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No.<br>
60/873,728, filed on December 8, 2006. The disclosure of the above application is<br>
incorporated herein by reference.<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0002] The present disclosure relates to transmissions, and more particularly<br>
to a multiple speed transmission having a dual clutch assembly and a countershaft.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0003] A typical multi-speed, dual clutch transmission uses a combination of<br>
two friction clutches and several dog clutch/synchronizers to achieve "power-on" or<br>
dynamic shifts by alternating between one friction clutch and the other, with the<br>
synchronizers being "pre-selected" for the oncoming ratio prior to actually making the<br>
dynamic shift. "Power-on" shifting means that torque flow from the engine need not be<br>
interrupted prior to making the shift. This concept typically uses countershaft gears with<br>
a different, dedicated gear pair or set to achieve each forward speed ratio. Accordingly,<br>
the total number of gears required in this typical design is two times the number of<br>
forward speeds, plus three for reverse. This necessitates a large number of required gear<br>
pairs, especially in transmissions that have a relatively large number of forward speed<br>
ratios.<br>
1<br><br>
Attorney Docket No.: P000340-PTT-DLT<br>
[0004] The addition of clutches, brakes, and gear sets to achieve these gear<br>
ratios and torque ranges may result in inefficient or undesirable transmission weights and<br>
sizes. Accordingly, there is a need in the art for a transmission having improved<br>
packaging while providing desirable gear ratios and torque ranges.<br>

[0026] FIG. 2 is a diagram of another embodiment of a multiple speed<br>
transmission according to the principles of the present invention.<br>
DESCRIPTION<br>
[0027] Referring to the drawings, wherein like reference numbers refer to<br>
like components, in FIG. 1 a multi-speed transmission 10 is depicted. The transmission<br>
10 includes an input member 12 and output member 14. In this embodiment, the input<br>
member 12 and the output member 14 are shafts, and will be referred to as such. Those<br>
skilled in the art will appreciate that the input and output members 12, 14 may be<br>
components other than shafts. The input shaft 12 is continuously connected with a torque<br>
converter 16 or other starting device. An engine (not shown) is connected to and<br>
provides a driving torque to the torque converter 16. The output shaft 14 is continuously<br>
connected with a final drive unit 18. The transmission 10 includes a countershaft gearing<br>
arrangement 20 that includes interconnecting members, a countershaft, co-planar<br>

herein. For example, the countershaft gearing arrangement 20 includes a first<br>
interconnecting shaft or member 22 and a second interconnecting shaft or member 24.<br>
The second interconnecting shaft 24 is a sleeve shaft concentric with the first<br>
interconnecting shaft 22. The countershaft gearing arrangement 20 further includes a<br>
countershaft 26. The countershaft 26 is both spaced apart from and parallel with the<br>
input shaft 12, the output shaft 14 and the interconnecting shafts 22, 24. The output shaft<br>
14, the interconnecting shafts 22, 24 and the countershaft 26 are supported by a plurality<br>
of support members including a first housing member 27, a second housing member 29,<br>
and a third housing member 31. The housing members 27, 29, 31 are fitted with bearings<br>

9<br><br>
Attorney Docket No.: P000340-PTT-DLT<br>
[0038] The transmission 10 further includes a plurality of selectively<br>
engageable synchronizers 120, 122, 124, 126, 128, 130, 132 and 134. Synchronizers<br>
120/122, 124/126, 128/130, 132/134 are a left and right side of the synchronizer<br>
assemblies, sharing a common synchronizer hub and sleeve. Synchronizer 120 is<br>
selectively engageable to connect gear 42 with second interconnecting shaft 24 for<br>
common rotation therewith. Synchronizer 122 is selectively engageable to connect gear<br>
52 with second interconnecting shaft 24 for common rotation therewith. Synchronizer<br>
124 is selectively engageable to connect gear 64 with countershaft 26 for common<br>
rotation therewith. Synchronizer 126 is selectively engageable to connect gear 76 with<br>
countershaft 26 for common rotation therewith. Synchronizer 128 is selectively<br>
engageable to connect gear 82 with first interconnecting shaft 22 for common rotation<br>
therewith. Synchronizer 130 is selectively engageable to connect gear 92 with first<br>

engageable to connect gear 104 with countershaft 26 for common rotation therewith.<br>
Synchronizer 134 is selectively engageable to connect gear 114 with countershaft 26 for<br>
common rotation therewith.<br>
[0039] The transmission 10 is capable of transmitting torque from the input<br>
shaft 12 to the output shaft 14 in at least seven forward torque ratios and one reverse<br>
torque ratio. Each of the forward torque ratios and the reverse torque ratio is attained by<br>
engagement of dual clutch 30 and one of the clutch elements 34, 36 and one or more of<br>
the synchronizers 120, 122, 124, 126, 128, 130, 132 and 134. Those skilled in the art will<br>
readily understand that a different speed ratio is associated with each torque ratio.<br>
10<br><br>
Attorney Docket No.: P000340-PTT-DLT<br>
[0040] To establish the reverse torque ratio clutch element 36 of the dual<br>
clutch 30 and synchronizer 126 are engaged. By this engagement, clutch element 36 of<br>
the dual clutch 30 transfers torque from the input shaft 12 through clutch housing 32 to<br>
the second interconnecting shaft 24. Further, torque is transferred from the second<br>
interconnecting shaft 24 through gear 72 to idler gear 74. Idler gear 74 transfers the<br>
torque to gear 76. Upon engagement of synchronizer 126, gear 76 transfers torque to<br>
countershaft 26. Countershaft 26 transfers the torque to gear 84. Gear 84 transfers<br>
torque to gear 86, which in turn transfers the torque to output shaft 14. Output shaft 14<br>
transfers the torque to the final drive unit 18.<br>
[0041] A first forward torque ratio (1st gear) is achieved by engaging clutch<br>
element 34 of the dual clutch 30 and synchronizer 134. By this engagement, clutch<br>
element 34 of the dual clutch 30 transfers torque from the input shaft 12 through clutch<br>
housing 32 to the first interconnecting shaft 22. Further, torque is transferred from the<br>
first interconnecting shaft 22 to gear 112. Gear 112 transfers the torque to gear 114.<br>
Upon engagement of synchronizer 134, gear 114 transfers torque to countershaft 26.<br>
Countershaft 26 transfers the torque to gear 84. Gear 84 transfers torque to gear 86,<br>
which in turn transfers the torque to output shaft 14. Output shaft 14 transfers the torque<br>
to the final drive unit 18.<br>
[0042] A subsequent forward torque ratio (2nd gear) is established by<br>
engagement of clutch element 36 of the dual clutch 30 and synchronizer 124. By this<br>
engagement, clutch element 36 of the dual clutch 30 transfers torque from the input shaft<br>
12 through clutch housing 32 to the second interconnecting shaft 24. Further, torque is<br>
11<br><br>
Attorney Docket No.: P000340-PTT-DLT<br>
transferred from the second interconnecting shaft 24 to gear 62. Gear 62 transfers the<br>
torque to gear 64. Upon engagement of synchronizer 124, gear 64 transfers torque to<br>
countershaft 26. Countershaft 26 transfers the torque to gear 84. Gear 84 transfers<br>
torque to gear 86, which in turn transfers the torque to output shaft 14. Output shaft 14<br>
transfers the torque to the final drive unit 18.<br>
[0043] The subsequent torque ratio (3rd gear) is established by engagement<br>
of clutch element 34 of the dual clutch 30 and synchronizer 132. By this engagement,<br>
clutch element 34 of the dual clutch 30 transfers torque from the input shaft 12 through<br>
clutch housing 32 to the first interconnecting shaft 22. Further, torque is transferred from<br>
the first interconnecting shaft 22 to gear 102. Gear 102 transfers the torque to gear 104.<br>
Upon engagement of synchronizer 132, gear 104 transfers torque to countershaft 26.<br>
Countershaft 26 transfers the torque to gear 84. Gear 84 transfers torque to gear 86,<br>
which in turn transfers the torque to output shaft 14. Output shaft 14 transfers the torque<br>
to the final drive unit 18.<br>
[0044] The next subsequent forward torque ratio (4th gear) is established by<br>
engagement of clutch element 36 of the dual clutch 30 and synchronizer 122. By this<br>
engagement, clutch element 36 of the dual clutch 30 transfers torque from the input shaft<br>
12 through clutch housing 32 to the second interconnecting shaft 24. Further, upon<br>
engagement of synchronizer 122 torque is transferred from the second interconnecting<br>
shaft 24 to gear 52. Gear 52 transfers the torque to gear 54. Gear 54 transfers torque to<br>
countershaft 26. Countershaft 26 transfers the torque to gear 84. Gear 84 transfers<br>
12<br><br>
Attorney Docket No.: P000340-PTT-DLT<br>
torque to gear 86, which in turn transfers the torque to output shaft 14. Output shaft 14<br>
transfers the torque to the final drive unit 18.<br>
[0045] The subsequent torque ratio (5th gear) is established by engagement<br>
of clutch element 34 of the dual clutch 30 and synchronizer 128. By this engagement,<br>
clutch element 34 of the dual clutch 30 transfers torque from the input shaft 12 through<br>
clutch housing 32 to the first interconnecting shaft 22. Further, upon engagement of<br>
synchronizer 122 the torque is transferred from the first interconnecting shaft 22 to gear<br>
82. Gear 82 transfers the torque to gear 84. Gear 84 transfers torque to countershaft 26<br>
and gear 86. Gear 86 transfers torque to output shaft 14. Output shaft 14 transfers the<br>
torque to the final drive unit 18.<br>
[0046] A subsequent forward torque ratio (6th gear) is established by<br>
engagement of clutch element 36 of the dual clutch 30 and synchronizer 120. By this<br>
engagement, clutch element 36 of the dual clutch 30 transfers torque from the input shaft<br>
12 through clutch housing 32 to the second interconnecting shaft 24. Further, torque is<br>
transferred from the second interconnecting shaft 24 to gear 42 through the synchronizer<br>
120. Gear 42 transfers the torque to gear 44. Gear 44 transfers torque to countershaft<br>
26. Countershaft 26 transfers the torque to gear 84. Gear 84 transfers torque to gear 86,<br>
which in turn transfers the torque to output shaft 14. Output shaft 14 transfers the torque<br>
to the final drive unit 18.<br>
[0047] The subsequent torque ratio (7th gear) is established by engagement<br>
of clutch element 34 of the dual clutch 30 and synchronizer 130. By this engagement,<br>
clutch element 34 of the dual clutch 30 transfers torque from the input shaft 12 through<br>
13<br><br>
Attorney Docket No.: P000340-PTT-DLT<br>
clutch housing 32 to the first interconnecting shaft 22. Further, torque is transferred from<br>
the first interconnecting shaft 22 to gear 92 through synchronizer 130. Gear 92 transfers<br>
the torque to gear 94. Gear 94 transfers torque to countershaft 26. Countershaft 26<br>
transfers the torque to gear 84. Gear 84 transfers torque to gear 86, which in turn<br>
transfers the torque to output shaft 14. Output shaft 14 transfers the torque to the final<br>
drive unit 18.<br>
[0048] The present invention contemplates that a variety of torque ratios<br>
(i.e., the ratio of torque of the output member 14 to the input member 12) are achievable<br>
through the selection of tooth counts of the gears of the transmission 10. Moreover, the<br>
present invention advantageously provides the transfer gears 82, 84, 86 in a single plane.<br>
This arrangement provides the opportunity to reduce transmission length in comparison<br>
with double plane transfer gears. Further, flexibility is provided in the selection of gear<br>
ratios with respect to 1st though 7th gear by utilizing single mesh pinions (separate<br>
pinions for each gear). Additional transmission length reduction is achieved through the<br>
use of single plane idler gear 74. Moreover, the single countershaft design decreases the<br>
radial packaging requirements of the transmission.<br>
[0049] Referring now to FIG. 2, an alternate embodiment of the present<br>
invention is illustrated as a multi-speed transmission 200. The transmission 200 includes<br>
an input member 12 and output member 14. In this embodiment, the input member 12<br>
and the output member 14 are shafts, and will be referred to as such. Those skilled in the<br>

Attorney Docket No.: P000340-PTT-DLT<br>
the synchronizers 300, 302, 304, 306, 308, 310, 312 and 314. Those skilled in the art will<br>
readily understand that a different speed ratio is associated with each torque ratio.<br>
[0062] To establish the reverse torque ratio clutch element 36 of the dual<br>
clutch 30 and synchronizer 300 are engaged. By this engagement, clutch element 36 of<br>
the dual clutch 30 transfers torque from the input shaft 12 through clutch housing 32 to<br>
the second interconnecting shaft 24. Further, torque is transferred from the second<br>
interconnecting shaft 24 through gear 212 to idler gear 210. Idler gear 210 transfers the<br>
torque to gear 216. Upon engagement of synchronizer 300, gear 216 transfers torque to<br>
countershaft 26. Countershaft 26 transfers the torque to gear 244. Gear 244 transfers<br>
torque to gear 246, which in turn transfers the torque to output shaft 14. Output shaft 14<br>
transfers the torque to the final drive unit 18.<br>
[0063] A first forward torque ratio (1st gear) is achieved by engaging clutch<br>
element 34 of the dual clutch 30 and synchronizer 308. By this engagement, clutch<br>

[0065] The subsequent torque ratio (3rd gear) is established by engagement<br>
of clutch element 34 of the dual clutch 30 and synchronizer 310. By this engagement,<br>
clutch element 34 of the dual clutch 30 transfers torque from the input shaft 12 through<br>
clutch housing 32 to the first interconnecting shaft 22. Further, torque is transferred from<br>
the first interconnecting shaft 22 to gear 262. Gear 262 transfers the torque to gear 264.<br>
Upon engagement of synchronizer 310, gear 264 transfers torque to countershaft 26.<br>
Countershaft 26 transfers the torque to gear 244. Gear 244 transfers torque to gear 246,<br>
which in turn transfers the torque to output shaft 14. Output shaft 14 transfers the torque<br>
to the final drive unit 18.<br>
[0066] The next subsequent forward torque ratio (4th gear) is established by<br>
engagement of clutch element 36 of the dual clutch 30 and synchronizer 306. By this<br>
engagement, clutch element 36 of the dual clutch 30 transfers torque from the input shaft<br>
12 through clutch housing 32 to the second interconnecting shaft 24. Further, upon<br>
engagement of synchronizer 306 torque is transferred from the second interconnecting<br>
shaft 24 to gear 242. Gear 242 transfers the torque to gear 244. Gear 244 transfers<br>

clutch housing 32 to the first interconnecting shaft 22. Further, upon engagement of<br>
synchronizer 314 torque is transferred from the first interconnecting shaft 22 to gear 282.<br>

which in turn transfers the torque to output shaft 14. Output shaft 14 transfers the torque<br>
to the final drive unit 18.<br>
[0068] A subsequent forward torque ratio (6th gear) is established by<br>
engagement of clutch element 36 of the dual clutch 30 and synchronizer 304. By this<br>
engagement, clutch element 36 of the dual clutch 30 transfers torque from the input shaft<br>
12 through clutch housing 32 to the second interconnecting shaft 24. Further, upon<br>
engagement of synchronizer 304 torque is transferred from the second interconnecting<br>
shaft 24 to gear 232. Gear 232 transfers the torque to gear 234. Gear 234 transfers<br>
torque to countershaft 26. Countershaft 26 transfers the torque to gear 244. Gear 244<br>
transfers torque to gear 246, which in turn transfers the torque to output shaft 14. Output<br>
shaft 14 transfers the torque to the final drive unit 18.<br>
[0069] The subsequent torque ratio (7th gear) is established by engagement<br>
of clutch element 34 of the dual clutch 30 and synchronizer 312. By this engagement,<br>
21<br><br>
Attorney Docket No.: P000340-PTT-DLT<br>
clutch element 34 of the dual clutch 30 transfers torque from the input shaft 12 through<br>
clutch housing 32 to the first interconnecting shaft 22. Further, torque is transferred from<br>
the first interconnecting shaft 22 to gear 272 through synchronizer 312. Gear 272<br>
transfers the torque to gear 274. Gear 274 transfers torque to countershaft 26.<br>
Countershaft 26 transfers the torque to gear 244. Gear 244 transfers torque to gear 246,<br>
which in turn transfers the torque to output shaft 14. Output shaft 14 transfers the torque<br>
to the final drive unit 18.<br>
[0070] The present invention contemplates that a variety of torque ratios<br>
(i.e., the ratio of torque of the output member 14 to the input member 12) are achievable<br>
through the selection of tooth counts of the gears of the transmission 200. Further,<br>
exceptional gear ratio flexibility is provided in the selection of gear ratios with respect to<br>
1st, 2nd, 3rd, 5th, 6th and 7th and reverse gear, as the pinions 212, 222, 232, 242, 252,<br>
262, 272, and 282 are single mesh pinions (i.e. each pinion meshes with only one gear).<br>
An overall transmission length reduction is achieved through the use of: (1) a reverse<br>
idler gear in a single plane; (2) a single plane of transfer gears; and (3) a single<br>
countershaft design, which decreases the radial packaging requirements of the<br>
transmission.<br>
[0071] In yet another embodiment of the present invention, a parking gear<br>
320 is provided. Parking gear 320, as shown in Fig. 2, is connected for common rotation<br>
with output shaft 14. Upon activation of the parking actuator (not shown) parking gear<br>
320 is rotationally fixed and, thus, prevents output shaft 14 from rotating. The present<br>
22<br><br>
Attorney Docket No.: P000340-PTT-DLT<br>
invention contemplates that parking gear 320 may be located at other locations along<br>
output shaft 14.<br>
