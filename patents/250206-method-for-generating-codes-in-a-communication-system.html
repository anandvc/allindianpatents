				<td>APPARATUS AND METHOD FOR GENERATING COPES<br>
IN COMMUNICATION SYSTEM<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1. Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates generally to code generation in a data<br>
communications system, and in particular, to an apparatus; and method for<br>
generating complementary turbo codes, considering the characteristics of turbo<br>
qodes in a packet communications system or a general communications system<br>
that employs a retransmission scheme.<br>
2. Description of the Related Art<br>
In general, a system using a retransmission scheme (e.g., HARQ; Hybrid<br>
Automatic Repeat Request) performs soft combining to improve transmission<br>
throughput. The soft combining techniques are divided into packet diversity<br>
combining and packet code combining. These two combining schemes are<br>
usually called soft packet combining. Although the packet diversity combining<br>
scheme is sub-optimal in performance relative to the packet code combining<br>
scheme, it is favorable due to easy implementation when performance loss is low.<br>
A packet transmission system uses the packet code combining scheme to<br>
improve transmission throughput. A transmitter transmits a code with a<br>
different code rate at each packet transmission. If an error is detected from the<br>
received packet, a receiver requests a retransmission and perfontns soft<br>
combining between the original packet and a retransmitted packet. The<br>
retransmitted packet may have a different code from the previous packet. The<br>
packet code combining scheme is a process of combining received N packets<br>
with a code rate R to a code with an effective code rate of R/N prior to decoding,<br>
to thereby obtain a coding gain.<br>
With regard to the packet diversity combining scheme, on the other hand,<br>
the transmitter transmits the same code with a code rate R at each packet<br>
transmission. If an error is detected from the received packet, the receiver<br>
requests a retransmission and performs soft combining between the original<br>
packet and the retransmitted packet. The retransmitted packet has an identical<br>
code to that in the previous packet. In this sense, the packet diversity<br>
combining scheme can be considered the received symbol energy averaging on a<br>
randojn channel. The packet diversity combining scheme reduces noise<br>
power by averaging the soft outputs of the received input symbols and achieves<br>
such a diversity gain as offered by a multi-path channel because the same code is<br>
repeatedly transmitted on a fading channel However, the packet diversity<br>
combining scheme does not provide such an additional coding gain as obtained<br>
according to a code structure in the packet code combining scheme.<br>
In the meanwhile, a turbo encoder generating the turbo code will be<br>
described herelnbelow. In the case of a turbo encoder with R=l/5, the turbo<br>
encoder generates information symbols X, first parity symbols Y0, Y0' and<br>
second parity symbols Y,, YI' by encoding input information symbols. The turbo<br>
encoder is comprised of two constituent encoders and one interleaves The first<br>
parity symbols Y0 and Y0' are output from a first constituent encoder by<br>
encoding the input information symbols and the second parity symbols Yj and<br>
Y/ from a second constituent encoder by encoding the information symbols<br>
interleaved through the interleaver. In detail, the Y0 is a row of first parity<br>
symbols generated from a first constituent encoder, and the Y0' is a row of<br>
second parity symbols generated from the first Constituent encoder.<br>
Due to implementation simplicity, most packet communication systems<br>
have used the packet diversity combining scheme, which is under study for<br>
application to the synchronous IS-2000 system and the asynchronous UMTS<br>
system. The reason is that the existing packet communication systems have<br>
used convolutional codes and even packet code combining does not offer a great<br>
gain when convolutional codes with a low data rate are used. If a system with<br>
R=l/3 supports retransmission, there is not a wide difference in performance<br>
between the packet code combining scheme and the packet diversity combining<br>
scheme. Thus, the packet diversity combining scheme is selected considering<br>
implementation complexity. However, use of turbo codes as forward error<br>
correction codes (FEC) requires a different packet combining mechanism<br>
because the turbo codes are designed as error correction codes to have<br>
performance characteristics very close to the "Shannon Channel Capacity Limit"<br>
and their performance varies obviously with the coding rates unlike<br>
convolutional codes. Therefore, it can be concluded that packet COde<br>
combining is desirable for a packet communication system using turbo codes in a<br>
retransmission scheme to achieve the goal of optimum performance.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is, therefore, an object of the present invention to provide an apparatus<br>
and method for generating sub-codes that enable optimum code combining in a<br>
retransmission system using turbo codes.<br>
It is another object of the present invention to provide an apparatus and<br>
method for generating complementary codes using turbo codes in a<br>
communication system..<br>
It is a further object of the present invention to provide an*apparatus and<br>
methdd for generating sub-codes to be generated after channel interleaving in ;a<br>
retransmission system using channel interleaving.<br>
The foregoing and other objects of the present invention are achieved by<br>
providing a QCTC (Quasi-Complementary Turbo Code) generating apparatus.<br>
In the QCTC generating apparatus, a turbo encoder has a plurality of constituent<br>
encoders and at least one interleave!' and generates an information symbol<br>
sequence and a plurality of parity symbol sequences according to a given code<br>
rate by encoding the information symbol sequence. The constituent'encoders<br>
generate the plurality of parity symbol sequences, each of the constituent<br>
encoders generates at least one parity symbol sequence, and the at least one<br>
parity symbol sequence from one constituent encoder corresponds to i the at least<br>
one parity symbol sequence from another constituent encoder. A channel<br>
interleaver individually interleaves the information symbol sequence and the<br>
parity symbol sequences, alternately arranges the symbols of the corresponding<br>
parity symbol sequences, and serially concatenates the interleaved information<br>
symbol sequence and the arranged parity symbol sequences. A QCTC<br>
generator generates a sub-code of a QCTC by repeating the serially concatenated<br>
symbol sequence and selecting a predetermined number of symbols; from the<br>
repeated symbol sequence according to code rate and selection information* •<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
The above and other objects, features and advantages of the present<br>
invention will become more apparent from the following -detailed description<br>
when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings in which:<br>
FIG. 1 is a schematic block diagram of a QCTC (Quasi-<br>
Complementary Turbo Code) generating apparatus according to the present<br>
invention;<br>
FIG. 2 is a block diagram of an embodiment of the QGTG generating<br>
apparatus according to the present invention; and<br>

generating apparatus according to the present invention.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
. Preferred embodiments of the present invention will be described<br>
hereinbelow with reference to the accompanying drawings. In the following<br>
description, well-known functions or constructions are not described in detail<br>
since they would obscure the invention in unnecessary detail.<br>
The present invention provides a QCTC generating method for a system<br>
using channel interleaving and a method of generating QCTCs in a<br>
predetermined way irrespective of a variable code length in a system requiring<br>
QCTCs with a variety of code rates. A QCTC is defined as a complementary<br>
code generated using a turbo code. The QCTC is not a perfect complemeiitary<br>
code as noted from the term "quasi" because a sub-code includes repeated<br>
symbols and has a different characteristic such as error correcting capability from<br>
another sub-code.<br>
FIG. 1 is a schematic block diagram of a QCTC generating apparatus<br>
according to the present invention. The QCTC generating apparatus shown in<br>
FIG. 1 is characterized by carrying out symbol sequence repetition and<br>
puncturing after channel interleaving when generating sub-codes.<br>
Referring to FIG. 1, an encoder 101 generates code symbols by encoding<br>
an input encoder packet. A conventional encoder or a turbo encoder can be<br>
used as the encoder 101. The encoder 101 has a code rate of, for example, 1/5.<br>
For the input of 3,072 information bits, the encoder 101 outputs 15,360 code<br>
symbols. A channel interleaver 102 interleaves the code symbols according to a<br>
predetermined rule. If the encoder 101 is a turbo encoder, the interleaver 102<br>
interleaves information symbols X, and parity symbols Y0, Y,, Y0', and Y! '<br>
separately. A QCTC generator 103 generates sub-codes by puncturing and<br>
repeating the interleaved symbols. The channel interleaver 102 iand the QCTC<br>
generator 103 perform the QCTC generation process.<br>
If the number of interleaved code symbols is 15,360 and the data rate (or<br>
code rate) of sub-codes is given as 307.2kbps, the QCTC generator 103 generates<br>
the first sub-code having 21,504 symbols by taking the 15,360 interleaved code<br>
symbols and repeating part of the first half of the interleaved code symbols. If<br>
the data rate is 614.4kbps, the QCTG generator 103 generates the first subrcode<br>
by taking the first 10,752 code symbols from the first half of the interleaved*code<br>
symbols. And if the data rate is 1228.8kbps or 2457.6kbps, the QCTC<br>
generator 103 generates the first sub-code by taking the first 5,376 code symbols<br>
from the interleaved code symbols.<br>
To generate a QCTC (or sub-codes), the channel interleaver 102 should<br>
take particular characteristics .because the five symbols X, Y0, Y|,Y and Y,'<br>
are distributed through channel interleaving and the distributed code symbols are<br>
not suitable for the input of the QCTC generator 103 and because it is not easy to<br>
generate sub-codes satisfying the characteristics of a QGTC with the mixed<br>
symbols of X, Y0, Yj, Y0, and Y . In this context, the present invention<br>
provides a method of generating a QCTC in a predetermined way irrespective of<br>
the code rate of each sub-code.<br>
FIG. 2 is a block diagram of the QCTC generating apparatus according<br>
to an embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 2, an encoder 201 generates code symbols by encoding<br>
input information symbols (i.e. input encoder packet). The encoder 201 uses a<br>
mother code with R=?l/5 or with any other code rate. A -mother code is<br>
determined by the system used. A turbo code with R-1/5 is used herein as a<br>
mother code by way of example. Then, the encoder 201 generates information<br>
symbols X, first parity symbols Y0 and Y0' and second parity symbols Y1and Y <br>
by encoding input information symbols. The first parity symbols Y0 and Y0' are<br>
output from a first constituent encoder and the second parity symbols Y1 and Y1'<br>
from a second constituent encoder. The first and second constituent encoders (not<br>
shown) are contained in encoder 201. The primary parity symbols Y0 and Y1<br>
from the first and second constituent encoders have a higher transmission priority<br>
than the secondary parity symbols YO'and Y1.<br>
A demultiplexer (DEMUX) 202 groups the code symbols received<br>
from the encoder 201 into information symbols X 203 parity symbols Y0 213,<br>
parity symbols YI 223, parity symbols Y0' 233, and parity symbols Y1' 243 and<br>
outputs the five symbol groups to corresponding respective interleavers 204, 214,<br>
224,234 and 244.<br>
Interleavers 204, 214, 224,234 and 244 randomly permute the<br>
sequences of the input code symbols by interleaving. Various interleaving<br>
methods are available as long as the following condition is satisfied.<br>
(Condition) Interleaved code symbols are partially punctured in such a<br>
way that the puncturing pattern of code symbols before interleaving has a<br>
uniform puncturing distance.<br>
The reason for satisfying the above condition is that when code symbol<br>
groups X, Y0, Yj, Y0', and Y,' are punctured in the same number of code symbol<br>
positions, the distance between punctured code symbol (positions in the code<br>
symbols before interleaving must be equal to achieve optimum turbo code<br>
performance. In other words, when puncturing is applied to turbo codes,<br>
uniformity is a significant factor that determines the performance of the turbo<br>
codes. In accordance with the present invention, sub-block interleaving applies<br>
independently to the code symbols X, Y0, Y0', Y1? and YI'. Uniform puncturing<br>
in each Interleaver output maintains, an equal distance between punctured code<br>
symbols in encoder output. Therefore, it can be concluded that channel<br>
interleaving must be chosen so that puncturing in interleaved code symbols can<br>
maintain a uniform puncturing distribution in channel encoder output.<br>
Such channel interleaving methods include bit reversal order (BRO)<br>
interleaving and partial bit reversal order (PBRO) interleaving. The BRO<br>
interleaving is practicable only if the number of input information symbols to an<br>
encoder and the number of each code symbol set X, Y0, Y0', Y,, and YI' are<br>
powers of 2, that is, 2m, wherein m is a parameter to make a block size of sub<br>
block interleaver such as block size N=2m*J.<br>
The PBRO interleaving was designed to satisfy the afore-stated condition<br>
even if the number of information symbols and the number of each encoder<br>
output symbol set X, Y0, Y0', Y,, and Yj' are not powers of 2 in order to<br>
overcome the limitation of the BRO interleaving, A detailed description of<br>
this sub-block channel interleaving will be avoided here and it is to be noted that<br>
any channel interleaving method can be implemented in the present invention as<br>
long as it satisfies the above condition.<br>
The interleaved code symbols X 206 (shown as a block for convenience)<br>
output from the first interleaver 204 are applied directly to the input of a symbol<br>
concatenator 207. The interleaved code symbols Y0 and Y1 from the second<br>
and third interleavers 214 and 224 are input to a first multiplexer (MUX) 205 and<br>
the interleaved code symbols Y0' and Y1 ' from the fourth and fifth interleavers<br>
234 and 244, to a second MUX 215. That is, the first MUX 205 receives the<br>
primary parity symbols and the second MUX 215 receives the secondary parity<br>
symbols.<br>
The first MUX 205 multiplexes the interleaved parity symbols Y0 and Y1<br>
216 and feeds the output to the symbol concatenator 207. The second MUX<br>
215 multiplexes the interleaved parity symbols Y0' and Y1' 226 and feeds its<br>
output to the symbol concatenator 207. That is, the MUXes 205 anditiS<br>
multiplex the parity symbol sequences by priority level. s With the aid ofithe<br>
MUXes 205 and 215, the interleaver outputs are rearranged and then divided into<br>
three sub-groups, 206, 216 and 226.<br>
The above-described process, which is essential to -generation of QGJBGs<br>
according to the present invention, will be described in more detail. As shown<br>
in FIG. 2, information symbols X form an independent sub-group without<br>
passing •through multiplexing after sub-block interleaving. Let the sub-block<br>
interleaved symbols be Sb1X, which can be expressed as<br>
..... (1)<br>
where Sbj_X(l) indicates the first code symbol output from the first interleaver<br>
204. Sbj_X is referred to as sequence A.<br>
Then, the interleaved code symbols YQ and Yt output from the second<br>
and third interleavers 214 and 224 are grouped into one sub-group. If the code<br>
symbols Y0 are Sbj_Y0, Sb1_Y0 can be expressed as<br>
Sb,_Y0(l), Sb,Y6(Z). Sbt_Y0(3),Sbt_Y0(4)..<br>
.,..,(2)<br>
where Sb1_Yo(l) indicates the first code symbol output from the second<br>
interleave 214. If the code symbols Y! are SbY1 Sb_Yl can be expressed as<br>
....-(3)<br>
where Sbj_Y,(l) and Sb-Y (2) indicate the first and second code symbols<br>
respectively, output from the third interleaver 224. After multiplexing the bode<br>
symbols Y0 and YI ,<br>
Sb,_Y0(l), Sbl<br>
These multiplexed symbols are referred to as sequence B.<br>
The reason for multiplexing the interleaved Code symbols Sbj_Y0 'and<br>
Sb_Y is that when M successive symbols are punctured in the sequence B<br>
irrespective of the first half or second half of the sequence B, the number of<br>
punctured symbols in Sb_Y0 is equal to that of punctured symbols in S bY only<br>
if M is an even number. If M is an odd number, the difference between the<br>
numbers of punctured symbols in Sb_Y0 and in S b Y is only 1. The<br>
multiplexing always satisfies the QCTC characteristic that the number of<br>
punctured parity symbols Y0 is equal to that of punctured parity symbols Yt.<br>
In the same manner, the interleaved code symbols Y0' and Y' output<br>
from the fourth and fifth interleavers 234 and 244 are grouped into one sub-group.<br>
If the code symbols Y0' and Y,' are Sb_Y0' and Sb_Y', respectively, Sb_Y0'<br>
and Sbj_Y ' can be expressed as<br>
, Sbi_Y0'(2), Sbi_Y0'(3), Sb<br>
. . . . . ( 5 )<br>
and<br>
.....(6)<br>
Then, the output of the second MUX 2 1 5 is<br>
These multiplexed symbols are referred to as sequence C.<br>
The reason for multiplexing the interleaved code symbols Sb_Y0' and<br>
Sb_Y,' is that when M successive symbols are punctured in the 'sequence C<br>
irrespective of the first half or second half of the sequence Q the number of<br>
punctured symbols in Sb_Y0' is equal to that of punctured symbols in SbYj'<br>
only if M is an even number. If M is an odd number, the difference between the<br>
numbers of punctured symbols in Sb_Y0' and in SbjVV is only 1. The<br>
multiplexing always satisfies the QCTC characteristic that the number of<br>
punctured parity symbols Y0' is equal to that of punctured parity symbols YI'.<br>
The symbol concatenator 207 sequentially concatenates the sequences A,<br>
B and C of the first, second, and third sub-groups and generates a symbol<br>
sequence [A:B:C].<br>
fA:S;CJ={Sb,_X(l}, Sbi_X(2),Sbl_X(3),...][SbiY0(\), Sb^YJl), Sbt_Y6(2.<br>
Sbl_Yl(2),..,J[Sbl_Y^(l),Sbi_Yl'(l)t Sb,_Y0'(2), Sbi_<br>
As seen from the above formula, information symbols are placed first,<br>
followed by alternating parity symbols Y0 and Y] and then by alternating parity<br>
symbols Y0' and Y,' in the sequence [A:B:C]. This symbol arrangement<br>
assumes a very significant meaning in QCTC generation, which will be described<br>
below.<br>
Puncturing should be carried out to generate a sub-code with a code rate<br>
from the turbo code of (8). The puncturing is defined by a "QCTC". The<br>
QCTG should have the following characteristics.<br>
(1) Information symbols precede all other code symbols in transmission.<br>
Especially, as the code rate of sub-codes is close to 1 , this characteristic becomes<br>
more important.<br>
(2) A puncturing pattern is formed so that the number of parity symbols<br>
output from each constituent encoder (a first constituent encoder and a second<br>
constituent encoder) is equal or their difference in number is minimum.<br>
(3) The number of punctured symbols in the parity symbols Y0 and Y0' is<br>
determined such that the code rate of the first constituent encoder is always less<br>
than 1. That is, the performance of turbo codes is ensured when at least one<br>
parity symbol Y0 or YO'exists.<br>
(4) The distance between punctured symbols in a QCTC resulting from<br>
puncturing is equal.<br>
(5) A turbo code produced by combining sub-codes of QCTCs assumes<br>
the characteristics of a quasi-complementary code.<br>
A QGTC with a subrcode code rate, which is generated by puncturing or<br>
pruning as many symbols as necessary from the end of the symbol sequence<br>
[A:B:C], satisfies the above five characteristics. In other words, an intended<br>
sub-code 6f a QCTG is generated by repeating and puncturing as many symbols<br>
as needed in the symbol sequence [A:B:G] in a symbol sequence repeater 208<br>
and a symbol puncturer 209. The symbol sequence repeater 208 repeats the<br>
symbol sequence received from the symbol concatenator in a predetermined way.<br>
The repetition method is determined according to the code rate of the sub-code.<br>
The symbol puncturer 209 punctures or prunes as many symbols as a<br>
predetermined number, starting with the last symbol in the symbol sequence<br>
received from the symbol sequence repeater 208, to thereby create the sub-code<br>
of the QCTC. The number of punctured symbols depends on the code-rate of<br>
the sub-code. Therefore, the code rate of the sub-code should be provided to<br>
the symbol sequence repeater 208 and the symbol puncturer 209 in order to<br>
perform sequence repetition and symbol puncturing. Alternatively, a higher<br>
layer controller (not shown) can calculate the number of repeated symbols arid<br>
the number of punctured symbols according to a mother code rate arid a subcode<br>
rate and feed the information to the symbol sequence repeater 208 and the<br>
symbol puncturer 209.<br>
In other words, the symbol puncturer 209 selects a predetermined<br>
number of symbols counted from a given symbol position in the symbol<br>
sequence received from the symbol sequence repeater 208, thereby generating<br>
lithe<br>
sub-code of the QCTC. The given symbol position refers to the symbol<br>
next to the last symbol selected for the previous transmission. Therefore, the<br>
symbol puncturer 209 can be called a "symbol selector".<br>
The interleaves 203, 213, 223, 233 and 243, the MUXes 205 and 215,<br>
and the symbol concatenator 207 in FIG. 2 correspond to the channel interleaver<br>
102 in FIG. 1, and the symbol sequence repeater 208 and the symbol puncturer<br>
209 both correspond to the QCTC generator 103.<br>
Returning to FIG. 1, assuming a mother code rate R=l/5 and 3,072 input<br>
information bits, the channel encoder 101 outputs 15,360 code symbols.<br>
Hereinbelow, there will be a description of generating QCTCs with different code<br>
rates (or data rates), for example, a first QCTC C at 307.2kbps, a second QCTC<br>
C, at 614.4kbps, and a third QCTC C3j at 1288 ;8kbps, from the code symbols.<br>
As described before, the 15,360 code symbols are classified into five<br>
sub-grdups, interleaved, and then rearranged as the symbol sequence of Eq. (8).<br>
Then, the 15,360 code symbols are subject to repetition according to a<br>
predetermined rule and puncturing (or pruning) according to a predetermined<br>
sub-code code rate. Thus, an intended sub-code is generated.<br>
For a data rate of 307.2kbps, if the sub-codes of the first QCTG Coj are<br>
21,504 bits in length, the first sub-code C0o is generated by selecting the first<br>
21,504 symbols from the interleaved and repeated Symbol Sequence. The<br>
second sub-code C01 is generated by selecting 21,504 symbols starting with the<br>
symbol following the first sub-code C0o from the repeated symbol sequence.<br>
The third sub-code C02 is generated by selecting the following 21,504 symbols.<br>
Similarly, for a data fate of 614;4kbps, if the sub-codes of the second<br>
QCTC GIJ are 10,752 bits in length, the first sub-code C10 is generated by<br>
selecting the first 10,752 symbols from the repeated symbol sequence. In other<br>
words, the first sub-code C,0 is generated by pruning all subsequent symbols<br>
following the first 10,752 symbols in the repeated symbol sequence. The<br>
pruning is performed in the symbol puncturer 209 as stated before. The second<br>
sub-code Cn is generated by selecting 10,752 symbols starting with the symbol<br>
following the first sub-code Cto from the repeated symbol sequence. The third<br>
sub-code Cn is generated by selecting the 10,752 symbols following the second<br>
sub-code Cn-<br>
Similarly, for a data rate of 1228.8kbps, if the sub-codes of th third<br>
QCTC C2j are 5,376 bits in length, the first sub-code C20 is generated by selecting<br>
the first 5,376 symbols from the repeated symbol sequence. The second subcode<br>
C2i is generated by selecting 5,376 symbols starting with the symbol<br>
following the first sub-code C20 from the repeated symbol sequence. The third<br>
sub-code C22 is generated by selecting the following 5,376 symbols. In this<br>
manner, the sub-codes of the QCTC at 1228.8kbps are generated.<br>
The system stores information about the position of the last symbol in<br>
the previous transmitted sub-code for each QCTC. When a data rate (or code<br>
rate) for retransmission is determined, the system selects a QCTC corresponding<br>
to the data rate and generates a sub-code by selecting a predetermined number of<br>
symbols following the stored last symbol for the selected QCTC according to the<br>
data rate. If the selected symbols exceed one interleaved symbol block, the<br>
remaining symbols are selected from the following block. In .this pase, subcodes<br>
are generated by repeating a block of interleaved symbols. To do so, a<br>
storing area is needed to store the repeated blocks.<br>
Alternatively, the interleaved symbols can be stored in a circular buffer<br>
memory and a sub-code is generated by selecting symbols recursively. That is,<br>
if interleaved symbols are all selected, a predetermined number of symbols are<br>
selected from the interleaved symbols starting with the first symbol. Then, the<br>
symbol sequence repeater 208 can be omitted since the circular buffer memory<br>
functions as the symbol sequence repeater 208.<br>
The above embodiment of the present invention describes twodimensional<br>
QCTCs. In the two-Tdirnensional QCTC scheme, a QCTC<br>
corresponding to each code rate is generated independently and the sub-cqdes of<br>
the QCTC are sequentially transmitted. However, the two-dimensional QCTCs<br>
are not optimum for the reasons described below.<br>
As shown in FIG. 2, it is assumed that the first sub-code Cqo of the first<br>
QCTC C0j is used for initial transmission&gt; the first sub-code C10 of the second<br>
QCTG GIJ is used for the next transmission, and the first sub-code C20 of the third<br>
QCTC C2j is used for the third transmission. Then, a receiver decodes data by<br>
combining the three sub-codes (C0o, Clo, C2o). In this case, however, the code<br>
combining does not recover an original code with a code rate of 1/5, only to<br>
increase the symbol energy of information symbols and thus not to optimize<br>
decoding performance. This implies that there is a problem with the<br>
transmission order of the sub-codes, that is, selection of the sub-codes. To<br>
overcome the problem, adaptive QCTCs are proposed. In the adaptive QCTC<br>
scheme, sthe number of code symbols to be selected is determined according to<br>
the code rate of a sub-code, and the sub-code is generated by selecting the<br>
determined number of symbols starting with the symbol following the last<br>
symbol used for the previous transmission.<br>
PIG. 3 is a block diagram of another embodiment of the QCTC<br>
generating apparatus. The structure shown in FIG. 3 is the same tas that shown<br>
in FIG, 2 except that the symbol sequence repeater and the symbol puncturer<br>
operate in different manners. Therefore, the following description is made<br>
mainly of the symbol sequence repeater 308 and the symbol puncturer 309.<br>
The symbol sequence repeater 308 repeats a symbol sequence<br>
from a symbol concatenator 307 in a predetermined way. The repetition may be<br>
carried out according to a given parameter in the symbol sequence repeater 308,<br>
or under the control of a higher layer controller (not shown), or upon request of<br>
the symbol concatenator 307. The above process is implemented in the; same<br>
manner as described referring to FIG. 2. Then, the symbol puncturer 309<br>
punctures symbols received from the symbol sequence repeater 308 according to<br>
a. different rule from the rule applied in FIG. 2 to generate a sub-code. The<br>
puncturing rule is as follows.<br>
It is assumed that transmission starts at time k, a sub-code transmitted at<br>
time (k+h) is expressed as Qj(k+h), and the code symbols of a .mother code with<br>
R=l/5 are Cm(0), Cm(l), . . ., Cm(N-l). The number of the code symbols, N, is<br>
defined as L_INFx5 since the mother code rate is 1/5. Here, L_!NF denotes the<br>
size of a sub-block interleaver, or the number of information symbols.<br>
Step 1: the length of an initial sub-code is determined.<br>
For an initial transmission, one Cio of the first sub-codes C0o&gt; Ao» ^20 °f<br>
available QCTCs is selected according to a given code rate and the length of the<br>
selected sub-code Ci0 is stored as a variable L_SC. The code rate or length<br>
L_SG of the sub-code is predetermined in the system according to channel<br>
environment 'including transmission channel condition and input data rate. The<br>
description is made in the context of three QCTCs shown in FIG. 3 for better<br>
understanding of the present invention, but the number of sub-codes is riot<br>
limited.<br>
Step 2: a sub-code for initial transmission is selected and transmitted.<br>
After the length of a sub-code to be transmitted is determined, Cm(0),<br>
Gm(l), . . ., Cm(L_SC-l) are selected among the code symbols of the mother code.<br>
If L_SC exceeds N, Cm(0), Cm(l), . . ., G™(N) are transmitted P times and then<br>
Cm(0), Cm(l), . . ., Cm(q-l) are transmitted. Here, P and q are the quotient and<br>
remainder of L2SC/N; respectively and P and q are calculated by L_SC mod N.<br>
Then, the variable q is stored for the next transmission for use ill detecting the<br>
position of the last symbol of the previous transmitted sub-code with respect to<br>
the block of interleaved symbols.<br>
Step 3: the starting position of a sub-code for the next transmission and<br>
the length of the sub-code are determined.<br>
For the next transmission, the code rate R_SC of a new sub-code to ?be<br>
transmitted is determined according to channel environment and the length L_SC<br>
of the sub-code is determined according to the determined code rate. The<br>
length L_SC and the code rate R_SC is in the relation of<br>
L_SC = L_INFx(l/R_SC)....<br>
.....(9)<br>
A higher layer system transmits the sub-code length LJSC and tile sub-code code<br>
rate R_SC to the symbol puncturer 309 for each transmission.<br>
Step 4: a sub-code for the next transmission is selected and transmitted.<br>
After the length L_SG of the sub-code to be transmitted is determined,<br>
Cm(q), Cm(q+l), . . ., Cni(q+L_SC-l) are selected among the code symbols of me<br>
mother code. In other words, as many symbols as the sub-code length are<br>
selected from the mother code symbols starting with the symbol following the<br>
last symbol selected for the previous transmission. If q+L_SC exceeds N, a row<br>
comprised of N code symbols starting with Cm(q) are selected recursively and<br>
transmitted P times and then the remaining q' code symbols are sequentially<br>
transmitted. Here, P and q' are the quotient and remainder of (LJ3C)/N,<br>
respectively and the q' is calculated by (q+L_SC) mod N. Theny me next<br>
symbol position value of the position of the last selected symbol for the next<br>
transmission is stored to the q. The variable q is the next symbol position of the<br>
last symbol position among symbols comprised of the last transmitted sub-code.<br>
After the generated sub-code is transmitted, the procedure returns to step 3.<br>
The transmission of adaptive QCTCs will be made clear with cases<br>
shown in FIG. 3. Referring to FIG. 3, a low rate sub-code with a code rate of<br>
1/7 is initially transmitted in Case 1, and a high rate sub-code with a code rate of<br>
4/7 is initially transmitted in Case 2. As seen from the cases, N (=15,360)<br>
successive mother code symbols are repeated and as many code symbols as a size<br>
corresponding to the length of a sub-code to be transmitted (or the code rate of<br>
the sub-code) are selected sequentially from the repeated mother code symbols,<br>
at each transmission.<br>
In real implementation, a buffer is not used to store (P-l) times repeatedmother<br>
codes, but a single circular buffer is employed to store N code symbols<br>
and recursively select code symbols to thereby generate a sub-code of an<br>
intended length. That is, use of the circular buffer memory obviates the need of<br>
sequence repetition. Any reception buffer is available to a receiver as long as it<br>
can store N soft metrics for code combining.<br>
While the invention has been shown and described with reference to<br>
certain preferred embodiments thereof, it will be understood by those skilled in<br>
the art that various changes in form and details may be made therein without<br>
