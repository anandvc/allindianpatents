				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
ETHOD FOR PRODUCING OPTICALLY-ACTIVE ALCOHOLS<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD	<br>
[0001]<br>
The present invention provides an industrially advantageous method for<br>
producing optically-active alcohols.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
[0002]<br>
Optically-active alcohols are useful as intermediates of agricultural chemicals<br>
and/or medical drugs. Various methods for producing optically-active alcohols are<br>
known, such as a resolution method, eazymatic/microbial method and asymmetric<br>
synthesis method. Methods for inducing ketone to corresponding optically-active<br>
alcohols by a catalytic asymmetric hydrogenation reaction is used have been extensively<br>
studied, since the reaction produces a smaller quantity of industrial waste and<br>
inexpensive hydrogen is used as a reducing agent. Industrially, among these methods,<br>
an asymmetric hydrogenation reaction of carbonyl compounds having a functional group<br>
in which an optically-active homogenous ruthenium catalyst is used is one of the<br>
effective techniques (for example, refer to "Asymmetric Catalysis in Organic Synthesis"<br>
written by R. Noyori, (U.S.A.), p. 56-82, 1994, Japanese Published Examined Patent<br>
Application No. H5-12353, Japanese Published Examined Patent Application No.<br>
H4-81596, Japanese Published Unexamined Patent Application No. H9-294932,<br>
Japanese Published Unexamined Patent Application No. H10-59992, Japanese Published<br>
Examined Patent Application No. 117-57758). However, the complex catalyst used in<br><br>
the above-described reaction is extremely expensive, which requires the catalyst quantity<br>
used in producing optically-active alcohols to be decreased to an industrially<br>
advantageous cost.<br>
[0003]<br>
It is known that in order to decrease the catalyst quantity, the addition of a strong<br>
acid such as hydrogen chloride results in improvement in catalyst activities in a reduction<br>
reaction similar to the above-described reaction (for example, "Journal of Organic<br>
Chemistry" (U.S.A.), Vol. 57, p. (5689, 1992, and "Tetrahedron Asymmetry" (UK), Vol.<br>
8, p. 4041, 1997). However, substrates unstable to acid such as carbonyl compounds<br>
having a functional group may result in a drastic reduction in yield by addition of an acid.<br>
Therefore, in an industrial production of optically-active alcohols, there has been<br>
demanded a method which will not affect a substrate or pose any problems in terms of<br>
operation and cost.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION<br>

method for producing optically-active alcohols, which is applicable to an acid-unstable<br>
compound in an asymmetric hydrogenation reaction of carbonyl compounds.<br>
[0005]<br>

optically-active alcohols and found a method for decreasing a catalyst quantity, which<br>

[0023]<br><br>
The above catalysts can be synthesized in accordance with the method described<br>
in Tetrahedron Lett., Vol.. 32, p. 4163, 1991. More specifically, an optically-active<br>
bidentate tertiary phosphorus ligand expressed by bivalent ruthenium complexes such as<br>
[RuCl2(l, 5-CgH12)]„(nithcnium chloride (II) I, 5-cyclooctadienc<br>
complex) is heated together with a coordinate compound expressed by Y such as DMF at<br>
temperatures from 50 to 200°C, preferably from 100 to 160°C, to obtain the catalysts.<br>
The molar ratio of a divalent ruthenium complex to an optically-active bidentate tertiary<br>
phosphorus ligand expressed by L is 1 : 0.5 to 1 : 5. preferably from 1 : 1 to 1 : 1.5.<br>
Since the previously described compounds which can be used as a ligand such as DMF<br>
are used as a reaction solvent, they arc not restricted in particular in usage amount<br>
relative to the divalent ruthenium complexes. However, these compounds are usually<br>
used in a quantity from 2 to 10,000 times (on w/w basis), preferably from 5 to 300 limes.<br>
Furthermore, after the synthesis of a ruthenium compound expressed by General<br>
Composition Formula (V), the compound (V) may be used in the reaction solution as it is.<br>
It is, however, preferable that the compound be used as a powder obtained by removing a<br>
substance (Y) from the reaction solution thereof.<br>
[0024]<br>
The above reaction can be carried out either in the presence or absence of a<br>
solvent. Any solvents can be used as long as they are inactive in the reaction, and<br>
preferable solvents include, for example, hydrocarbon-based solvents such as pentane,<br>
hexane, heptane, benzene, toluene and xylene; halogen-based solvents such as<br>
dichloromethane, 1, 2-dichloroelhane, chloroform and carbon tetrachloride; alcohols such<br>
as methanol and ethanol; nitrile-based solvents such as acetonitrlie, propione nitrile;<br>
emer-based solvents such as diethyl ether, dioxane, tetrahydrofuran; non-protonic polar<br>
solvents such as DMF and dimethyl sulfoxide; water; and mixed solvents in which two or<br><br>
more of the above-described solvents are mixed. Of these solvents, alcohols are in<br>
particular preferable.<br>
Inactive solvents may be used in any quantity. However, a practical volume ratio(a<br>
compound expressed by Formula (I) to an inactive solvent) is from 0 to 100, and a<br>
preferable ratio is from 0 to 10.<br>
[0025]<br>
An optically-active alcohol (II) of the present invention can be produced by<br>
mixing a compound expressed by Formula (I), an optically-active hydrogenation<br>
complex catalyst expressed by Composition Formula (V) and an inorganic salt in the<br>
presence or absence of a solvent and applying hydrogen pressure thereto. Addition of<br>
an inorganic salt, which is a feature of the present invention, makes it possible to attain<br>
favorable optical and chemical yields, while the molar ratio (a compound expressed by<br>
Formula (1) / an optically-active hydrogenated catalyst expressed by Composition<br>
Formula (V),hereinafter, abbreviated as S/C) is kept high.<br>
[0026]<br>
The molar ratio of (an inorganic salt) / (an optically-active hydrogenation<br>
complex catalyst expressed by Composition Formula (V)) is from 50 to 1,000, preferably<br>
from 3 to 400. An inorganic salt may be used as it is or may be used after being<br>
dissolved in any of the above-desciibed solvents. In this case, the S/C is from 5,000 to<br>
100, 000, preferably from 10,000 to 3C,000.<br>
Where the inorganic salt is used in the above-described quantity and S/C range,<br>
an appropriate reaction can be carried out, with the pressure, the temperature and the time<br>
being subjected to practical restrictions. More specifically, the reaction can be carried<br>
out at any pressure above a normal pressure, if there are no apparatus restrictions and at<br>
temperatures higher than a melting point of a reaction solution but lower than a<br><br>
decomposition point of a substrate. Furthermore, the reaction will be completed in a<br>
shorter time under high pressure and high temperature conditions and in a longer time<br>
under low pressure and low temperature conditions. In a practical point of view, a<br>
preferable reaction pressure is from 3 to 10 MPa, and a preferable reaction temperature is<br>
from 5 to 100°C. In this case, the reaction will be completed within 1 to 48 hours.<br>
Since favorable optical and chemical yields can be attained, an optically-active alcohol,<br>
which is a reaction product after the reaction, can be purified by a known method such as<br>
distillation.<br>
[0027]<br>

Reference Example 1 (4.8 mg: 0.0051 mmol; S/C = 19,600) were placed into an<br>
autoclave (100ml) and subjected to argon substitution. 2-Methyl-4-oxo-2-pentanol<br>
(11.5 g: 100 mmol) and methanol (11.6 ml) were placed into a Schlenk flask and<br>
subjected to argon substitution. Thereafter, a syringe was used to transfer the resultant<br>
to the autoclave. Furthermore, lithium chloride (60 mg: 1.4 mmol) was added to the<br>
autoclave, and the reaction was canied out at a hydrogen pressure of 9 MPa at 60°C for<br>
12 hours. Thereafter, the autoclave was cooled to reduce the pressure to a normal level,<br>
and the reaction solution was subjected to gas chromatography (CP-Chirasil DEX-CB:<br>
0.25 mm *25 m, Inj: 200°C. Column: 100°C, DET: 200°C) to analyze the same. The<br>
target compound was 96.7%ee in optical purity, 100% in conversion rate and 99.1% in<br>
GC yield.<br>

autoclave (lOOml) and subjected to argon substitution. 3-Oxo-l-butanol (8.8 g: 99.9<br>
mmol) and methanol (7.3 ml) were placed into a Schlenk flask and subjected to argon<br>
substitution. Thereafter, a syringe was used to transfer the resultant to the autoclave.<br>
Furthermore, a syringe was used to add 0.012N hydrochloride methanol solution (2.0 ml:<br>
0.024 mmol) to the autoclave, and die reaction was carried out at a hydrogen pressure of<br>
6 MPa at 60°C for 24 hours. Thereafter, the autoclave was cooled to reduce the<br>
pressure to a normal level, and the reaction solution was subjected to gas<br>
chromatography (CP-Chirasil DEX-CB; 0.25 nun *25 m, Inj: 200°C. Column: 100°C,<br>
DET: 200°C) to analyze the same. The target compound was 95.9%ee in optical purity,<br>
100% in conversion rate and 77.5% in yield.<br>

complex catalyst (5.2 mg: 0.0055 mmol; S/C = 19,000) synthesized similarly to<br><br>
Reference Example 1 were pi iced into a Schleivk flask and subjected to argon<br>
substitution. After a stirrer was placed into an autoclave (100 ml), a syringe was used to<br>
transfer the resultant to the autoclave (100 ml) which had been subjected to argon<br>
substitution. The reaction was carried out at a hydrogen pressure of 10 MPQ at 70°C for<br>
19 hours. Thereafter, the autoclave was cooled to reduce the pressure to a normal level,<br>
and the reaction solution was analyzed, it was found that the thus obtained target<br>
compound was 96.0%ee in optical purity and 43% in conversion rale.<br>
