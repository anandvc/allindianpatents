The user benefits because running one test is more time and cost efficient than running two. Moreover the early HIV detection is extremely important for all the patients regardless of lifestyle in reducing further transmission. The study confirms that the combined HIV Ab/Ag assays are able to detect HIV infection earlier than an antibody only assay.<br><br>
Detailed Description of the invention<br>
HIV P24 antigen test device for the detection of the specific p24 antigen is a test device for the early and rapid detection of the HIV in human body. Antigen can generally only be detected during the acute and during the symptomatic phase of AIDS. Antibodies to HIV-1&amp; 2 can be detected throughout virtually the entire infection period. When the HIV virus enters into the body the earlier detection of the diseases is impossible because the virus enters in a window phase and subsequently the immune system starts producing antibodies. So the use of highly sensitive antibody assays is therefore an established approach in serodiagnosis of HIV infection. Progressive improvements in assay sensitivity have reduced that window phase. Further shortening of this period can be achieved by the incorporation of HIV antigen detection in such antibody test enabling the detection of the infected individuals at the earliest possible moment.p24 antibody dot detects the specific p24 antigens of HIV. So early detection of HIV is possible.<br>
The device of the present invention includes three dots/lines and one built control dot/line wherein at least one test dot/line uses antigens. The function of the control dot is to indicate the proper functioning of the device. Accordingly the present invention relates to a rapid, visual, sensitive and qualitative in vitro diagnostic kit for the detection of the antibodies and antigens of a HIV in human serum and plasma and whole blood comprising a test device, a buffer solution, a conjugate and p24 conjugate.<br>
The device comprises of a plastic base, an absorbent pad, made of cellulosic material for e.g. cellulose nitrate. The membrane is cut from the cellulosic material and is mounted on an absorbent pad which is housed in the casing. The casing comprises of top cover and bottom cover air tightly pressed with each other. A hole is provided in the top cover at the center of the device through which the membrane is exposed.<br><br>
The membrane is mounted on a laminated or unlaminated absorbent. The recombinant protein or biotinylated recombinant proteins or synthetic peptides or biotinylated synthetic peptides or a mixture thereof are immobilized in the membrane. The control dot meant to test the workability of the device is coated with antihuman IgG e.g. donkey or chicken or any other non cross reacting antibody. After adding the conjugate reagent, it gives a pink colour which determines that the device is workable. HIV1 detection dot for the detection of HIV1 antibody is coated with glycoprotein 41 and C terminus of glycoprotein 120 in the ratio 45:55 respectively and vice versa. Preferably the ratio of glycoprotein 41 and C terminus of glycoprotein 120 is in the ratio 50:50. Similarly the HIV 2 detection dot for the detection of HIV 2 antibodies is coated with glycoprotein 36 immobilized on the said membrane in the form of dot or line. HIV P24 detection dot for the detection of the HIV P24 antigen is coated is 1 nanogram to 10 microgram. All these four spots are within the circumference of the immunofiltration membrane.<br>
Working example Sample:<br>
The sample should be only human serum or plasma or whole blood. Collect blood in a clean dry vial and allow to clot or separate the serum by centrifugation at room temperature. For using whole blood as sample a separate filter device is provided to fit into the nest of existing testing device. It separates the RBCs from the blood and allows plasma to filter and pass on the testing device.<br>
Preparation of buffer solution:<br>
A liquid dispensing buffer is used to dissolve the glycoprotein HIV1 and HIV2 and dispensing on the device.<br><br>
Preparation of protein A conjugate:<br>
1.	To an initial solution of 0.01%-0.05 %(w/v) Gold chloride (HAuCL4) that is at boiling temperature sodium citrate solution (1-5%) is added. The solution is rapidly stirred and boiled until a pink purple colour develops. Protein A is added to the same.<br>
2.	Any non immune animal serum (Mouse /goat /rabbit/sheep) is added to the above solution.<br>
The concentration of serum could be 1 microgram to 10 microgram/ml of gold colloid solution. This solution is mixed for 2 hrs to over night. After this the solution is centrifuged and the supernatant is discarded .dissolve the pellet in buffer containing stabilizers such as BSA, Gelatin to obtain the protein A conjugate.<br>
Preparation of p24 conjugate:<br>
Preparation of p24 antibody conjugate in the form of liquid lyophilized comprises adding sodium citrate solution (1-5%) to 0.01% - 0.05% (w/v) gold chloride (HauCI4) at a boiling temperature; rapidly stirring and boiling the solution until a pink purple colour develops: adding p24 antibody to the solution; adding any non immune animal serum such as mouse/goat/sheep/rabbit 1 microgram to 10 microgram/ml of gold colloidal solution; mixing the solution for 2 hours to overnight; centrifuging the solution to discard the supernatant.<br>
Preparation of streptavidin gold conjugate:<br>
1. To an initial solution of 0.01 %- 0.05% (w/v) gold chloride (HAuCI4) that is at a boiling temperature, sodium citrate solution (15%) is added. The solution is rapidly stirred and boiled until a pink purple colour develops Streptavidin is added to the same.<br><br>
2. Any non-immune animal serum (mouse/goat/rabbit/sheep) is added to the<br>
above solution. Solution is centrifuged and the supernatant is discarded. Dissolve the pellet in buffer containing stabilizers such as BSA, Gelatin to obtain the streptavidin gold conjugate.<br>
Test procedure<br>
1.	Adding 5 drops of wash buffer to the device and waiting till the solution is completely absorbed by the membrane. All solution and sample should be added to the center of the membrane.<br>
2.	Adding 1 drop of sample. The sample should be only human serum or plasma. When the patient's sample passes through the membrane, HIV antibodies and p24 antigens if present in the sample binds to the immobilized HIV antigens and p24 antibody respectively.<br>
3.	Adding 5 drops of buffer solution.<br>
4.	Adding 2 drops of protein A conjugate.<br>
5.	Adding 2 drops of wash buffer.<br>
6.	Adding 2 drops of p24 conjugate.<br>
P24 conjugate binds to the p24 antibody-antigen complex and protein A conjugate binds to the Fc portion of the HIV antibodies to give pinkish purple color dots against whitish background.<br>
7.	Adding 5 drops of wash buffer solution to wash off other impurities present.<br>
8.	Reading the results.<br>
There are four formats by which the test can be performed.<br>
Interpretation of results for all the four formats will be same as given below:<br><br>
On performing the test, if only the control dot appears which is in pink colour, then the result is interpreted as negative and the procedure carried out for the detection are perfectly right. If both the control dot and hivl antibody detection spot appears in pink colour, then the result is that the patient is reactive for HIV-1 antibody. If the control dot and the HIV appear in pink colour, then the patient is reactive for HIV-2 antibodies, if both HIV1 and HIV2 antibody detection dot and the control dot appear in pink colour, then the patient is reactive for both HIV1 &amp; HIV2 antibodies . if both control dot and p24 detection spot appear in pink color, indicating the early stage of HIV infection. If the control dot, HIV p24 and the HIV 1 dot appear pink in colour, then the patient is reactive for HIV-1 antibody and HIV P24 antigen. If the control dot p24 antigen dot and the HIV-2 DOT appear pink in colour, then the patient is reactive for HIV-2 antibody and HIV P24 antigen. If all the four dots appear pink in colour, then the patient is reactive for HIV-1 &amp; HIV-2 antibodies and HIV P24 antigen.<br>
According to the present invention, a device for the rapid detection of HIV antigen and antibodies to HIV-1 and HIV-2 in the human beings comprises an airtight container having an absorbent pad, a nitrocellulose membrane mounted on the absorbent pad provided with a circular hole in the top cover through which the membrane is exposed.
