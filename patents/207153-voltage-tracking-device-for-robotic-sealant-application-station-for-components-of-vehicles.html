TITLE<br>
Voltage tracking device for robotic sealant application station for ensuring sealant application in all the spots for the components of vehicles<br>
APPLICANTS<br>
Tata Motors Limited, Bombay House, 24 Homi Mody Street, Hutatma Chowk, Mumbai - 400001, Maharashtra, India, an Indian company<br>
INVENTOR<br>
Under Section 28(2)<br>

The following  specification  particularly describes  the  nature of this invention and the manner in which it is to be performed :<br><br>
Granted<br><br><br><br>
FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a voltage tracking device for robotic sealant application station for ensuring sealant application in all the spots for the components of vehicles.<br>
PRIOR ART<br>
In automobile industry, components of vehicles such as bonnet centre (inner) are applied with a sealant at predetermined spots in a robotic sealant application station. The components are then sealed together in a press to form assemblies or aggregates such as bonnets.<br>
A robotic sealant application station is fully automatic and unmanned and comprises a PLC (Programmable Logic Controller) connected to a robot controller, a sealant application controller connected to the robot controller and a sealant gun i.e. robot connected to the sealant application controller through a sealant valve. The PLC decides when sealant is to be applied and gives a command to the robot controller which in turn gives an electrical signal to the sealant application controller. The sealant application controller gives  a  command  in the form of a voltage<br><br>
'signal to the sealant gun through the sealant valve, which applies the sealant to the job i.e. component at the predetermined spots. In such a sealant application station there are chances of components passing by without all the spots in the components being applied with the sealant and the sealant application cycle getting over as if sealant application had been fully completed. If the components are not applied with sealant at all the spots, the joints between the assemblies or aggregates of the components may become weak and fail. Since the station is unmanned and fully automatic it is not possible to check whether sealant has been actually applied at all the spots in the components of the vehicles and the fault goes undetected. This results in rework i.e. reapplication of sealant  by repeating the cycle.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
An object of the invention is to provide a voltage tracking device for robotic sealant application station for ensuring sealant application in all the spots for the components of vehicles, which ensures that sealant has been applied at all the spots in the components of the vehicles  going past the station thereby avoiding<br><br>
rework of the components i.e. application of sealant by repeating the cycle.<br>
Another object of the invention is to provide a voltage tracking device for robotic sealant application station for ensuring sealant application in all the spots for the components of vehicles, which is simple in construction and easy to operate.<br>
Another object of the invention is to provide a voltage tracking device for robotic sealant application station for ensuring sealant application in all the spots for the components of vehicles, which is economical.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION According to the invention there is provided a voltage tracking device for robotic sealant application station for ensuring sealant application in all the spots for components of vehicles comprising a PLC (Programmable Logic Controller) connected to a robot controller, a sealant application controller connected to the robot controller and a sealant gun connected to the sealant application controller through a sealant valve, characterized in that the said PLC is having a timer, the said PLC and the said sealant application controller<br><br>
being looped together by an input line which is connected to the said PLC and also across the said sealant application controller and the said sealant valve and the said PLC being further connected to an audio visual or visual indicator.<br>
The following is a detailed description of the invention with reference to the accompanying sole Figure 1 which is a block diagram of a voltage tracking device for robotic sealant application station for ensuring sealant application in all the spots for the components of vehicles according to an embodiment of the invention.<br>
The device 1 of the invention comprises a PLC with timer marked 2 connected to a robot controller 3 for controlling the motions of the robot. 4 is a sealant application controller for applying sealant connected to the robot controller. 5 is a sealant gun connected to the sealant application controller through a sealant valve 6. The PLC and sealant application controller are looped together by a input line 7 which is connected to the PLC and also across the sealant application controller and sealant valve. The PLC is further connected to an audio visual indicator marked 8.<br><br><br>
The timer in the PLC is set for a particular period of time i.e. time interval corresponding to duration of each instance of sealant application. The PLC decides when sealant is to be applied and gives a command to the robot controller. Simultaneously Ihe timer in the PLC goes'on. The robot controller gives an electrical signal to the sealant application controBerwhich in turn gives a command in the form of a voltage signal to the sealant gun through the sealant valve, which applies the sealant to the job i.e. the component (not shown). Simultaneously the voltage across the sealant application controller and the sealant valve is tapped and fed to the PLC via the input line. The PLC senses this voltage at the end of the time interval corresponding to an instance of sealant application. This indicates that voltage had actually appeared across the sealant gun after the PLC had given the sealant appfication command to the robot controller and sealant application<br>
had  taken place: The PLC will only then give the next  sealant<br>
appfication command to the robot controller If no	voltage appears<br>
across    the sealant  gun after  the PLC had   given   the   sealant<br>
application cornmand tolhe robot cobtroller then no voltage	is fed <br><br>
the PLC via the input line. The PLC senses the absence of voltage at the end of the time interval and actuates the audio visual indicator thereby alerting an operator at a nearby station to stop the sealant application cycle. The device of the invention thus ensures that sealant has been applied at all the spots in the component of the vehicle going past the station thereby avoiding rework of the component i.e. reapplication of sealant by repeating the cycle. The device of the invention is also simple in construction and easy to operate. The cost of the components of the device is negligible. Therefore, the device is economical.<br>
The audio visual indicator may be a hooter for audio indication and a lamp or a LCD (liquid crystal display) for a visual indication. It may comprise only visual indicator such as lamp or LCD or audio indicator such as hooter. Such variations of the invention are to be construed and understood to be within the scope of the invention.<br><br>
