AIRCRAFT SEAT<br>
The present invention relates to an aircraft seat, in particular one convertible to abed.<br>
Convertible seats are well known. There is, however, a difficulty in arranging a maximum number of such seats in an aircraft cabin, in that they are not readily configured in lines abreast as regards access. A staggered or herringbone arrangement is preferred in terms of privacy and efficient arrangement of the seats in a cabin.<br>
An awkwardness of a herringbone arrangement of essentially rectangular seats along the edge of a cabin is that at one end - the head end in practice - a triangular area exists against the cabin wall beyond the end of the seat<br>
In International Patent Application No WO 03/013903, in the name of Virgin Atlantic Airways Limited, there is a proposal to utilise the triangular area to extend the length of the bed surface (page 29, lines 13-15). This seat is configured such that the seat backrest folds forwards for conversion to a bed, with the bed surface being formed by the backrest of the seat backrest and other surfaces (Figure 5).<br>
The object of the present invention is to utilise the triangular area by accommodating part of the reclined seat forming the bed surface in the triangle.<br>
A difficulty with this concept as taught by Virgin is that use of the triangular surface per se as part of the bed surface moves the entire reclining seat further from the cabin wall, since the seat backrest and the head rest must be of a certain length to accommodate tall passengers and the head rest must finish on the side of the triangular space remote from the cabin wall.<br>
An alternative which we have adopted in the present invention is to lower the head rest into the triangular area. This makes for more efficient use of the space, but creates another problem in that the cabin wall is not vertical but curves inwards over the triangle. Lowering a full length seat backrest and head rest into the triangular<br><br>
Whilst it can be envisaged that the squab movement mechanism can be a linkage mechanism, in which a single actuator moves all parts of the seat in phase with each other between the different configurations of the seat, in the preferred embodiment, the mechanism includes a plurality of actuators under control of a control system programmed to synchronise the actuators.<br>
The headrest can be arranged to move translationally towards the seat squab general parallel to the backrest to achieve the foreshortening of the backrest and the headrest. However in the preferred embodiment, the headrest is pivotally arranged on the backrest for foreshortening movement by angling of the headrest such that the front faces of the headrest and the backrest form an obtuse angle, the control system being programmed to achieve this obtuse angle during lowering of the backrest from the sitting configuration to bed configuration.<br>
In the preferred embodiment, the headrest is pivotally connected to the backrest at a pivot axis therebetween, close to the front of faces of these. Alternatively the headrest may be connected to the backrest by legs which can be telescopically withdrawn (e.g. into tubes in the frame of the backrest) to bring the headrest closer to the backrest and thereby to foreshorten the combined length of the backrest and the headrest.<br>
It can also be envisaged that the squab movement mechanism and the control system can be an integrated mechanism with a single actuator lowering both the seat backrest and inclining the headrest forwards during such lowering, with the control system being a simple up/down control. However, in the preferred embodiment, separate actuators are provided for the backrest and the headrest, typically electric motor and gearbox driven lead screw devices, and the control system is an electronic controller. Alternatively, hydraulic pump and ram devices can be used. The backrest actuator (and squab) actuators can be as described in our prior European Patent No 1,074,468 ("Our Earlier European Patent").<br>
Preferably, the controller is programmed to allow the headrest to be raised for watching of television when the seat is fully reclined to bed configuration and<br><br>
The seat has a movable squab 11, a movable leg rest 12, and a fixed foot rest 14, which also are conventional. The movable backrest 15 of the seat is conventional, save that it has a headrest 17 pivotally connected to it about a pivot axis between them and close to the front face of the backrest and the headrest. A control panel 21 is provided on the partition 2 for controlling the disposition of the seat.<br>
The seat is supported on&gt;<br>
•	runners 22 on a frame 23, incorporated in the partitions, via sliders 24 attached to the underside of the rear of the squab, immediately below a pivotal connection 25 of the backrest and the seat squab;<br>
•	front legs 26 pivoted to the aircraft deck 27 and the underside of the front of the squab; and<br>
•	rear legs 28 pivoted to the deck and the back of the backrest some 20% up its height.<br>
The seat is actuated by a slide actuator 29 acting between the frame 23 and the front legs 26 and recline actuator 30 acting to extend or retract the rear legs. A further actuator (not shown) extends or retracts the foot rest. The arrangement of the runners, legs and actuators is as in Our Earlier European Patent.<br>
The pivoted head rest 17 is provided with a 41 rear crank pivotally connected to a lead screw 43 from an actuator 44 for rotating a non-shown screw nut. The arrangement is such that the headrest can be pivoted about an axis 45 to lie at an obtuse angle a (see Figure 5) with respect to the front face of the backrest or generally parallel therewith. The back of the headrest is provided with a collapsible bellows 46 and a movable back plate 47, normally urged away from the headrest by internal pressure or resilience, these components being shown in Figures 7 &amp; 8 only.<br>
Figure 3 shows the normally sitting up position of the seat, in which the slide actuator 29 holds the squab back towards the cabin wall 48 and the recline actuators 30 are extended. Figure 4 shows the seat slightly reclined with the slide actuator 29 unadjusted and the rear legs 28 shortened by the recline actuators. As will be seen in<br><br>
backrest in the position equivalent to Figure 5 and enable the backrest to be moved between the sitting and bed configurations without fouling the cabin wall.<br>
The invention is not intended to be restricted to the details of the above described embodiment. For instance, the head rest can be manually operated, particularly in the Figure 9 embodiment by providing a manual lever in place of the motor drive 153.<br>
Further, where as in the embodiment of Figure 1, the head rest has a rounded<br>
A,<br>
top, this can be modified to allow the very top to pivot forwards to give a more conventional appearance, with the top being folded up for use. This envisaged primarily as a matter of appearance as opposed to function.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
