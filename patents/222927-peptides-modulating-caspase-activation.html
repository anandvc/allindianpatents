				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is related to medicine and mechanisms of death of human and animal cells.<br>
In particular, it is related to peptides capable of inhibiting apoptotic cell death induced by different<br>
factors. The invention describes peptides with such activities and methods of producing and using<br>
said peptides.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Apoptosis is an active form of cell death that is involved in multiple processes of normal cell<br>
development as well as in malignant cell transformations. Mechanism of apoptosis is engaged in<br>
biological events induced by various types of drugs, cytokines, and growth factors, oxidative stress,<br>
radiation, aging, autoimmune diseases, and immune rejection within organ transplantation. Recent<br>
studies on apoptosis demonstrate that common molecular mechanisms are employed in various<br>
types of apoptosis, induced by hormones, cytokines, growth factor deprivation, chemotherapeutic<br>
agents, ionizing radiation, immunological disorders, AIDS, cancer and aging (Nagata, (1997) Cell<br>
88, 355-365).<br>
Cascade-like activation of caspase proteases represents the fundamental point in the induction of<br>
apoptosis. Two distinct types of apoptosis signaling are described. The initial phase of receptor-<br>
depending triggering of apoptosis includes activation of appropriate death receptors by specific<br>
ligands, such as TNF or FasL, which are presently the most studied inductors of apoptosis. Upon<br>
activation, cell surface death receptors, Fas (CD95) or TNFR1, are attached to cytosolic adapter<br>
proteins (FADD, MORT, RIP, TRADD), which in turn recruit caspase-8 to activate the interleukin-<br>
1-?-converting enzyme ICE/CED-3 family protease (caspase) cascade, followed by activation of<br>
CPP32/caspase-3-subfamily of cysteine proteases, whose members occur in cell cytoplasm in the<br>
form of latent precursors, procaspases. Receptor-independent types of apoptosis usually include<br>
critically important cytochrome c-inducible mechanism that requires the formation of tertiary<br>
complex of cytochrome c, dATP, Apaf-1 and procaspase-9, that lead to the activation of the latter<br>
via autoproteolysis and homodimerization, and subsequent caspase cascade activation (Cohen, et<br>
al. (1997) Biochem. J., 326:1-16).<br><br>
Agents that affect the biological control of apoptosis thus have a potential therapeutic utility in<br>
numerous clinical applications. A variety of plant-derived inhibitors of agogtosis are employed to<br>
screen pathological disorders that often accompany chemotherapy, radiation, immune disorders, or<br>
AIDS. These supplements generally contain carbohydrates, fat and plant protein hydrolysates,<br>
lectins, and phospholipids (US6004579, Barr et al.). Potent regulators of apoptosis could be<br>
employed in the treatment of cancer patients to control cytokine therapy, chemotherapy, or<br>
radiation therapy. Apoptotic mechanisms operate at the various types of immunological disorders,<br>
such as autoimmune malignancies, immune rejection in organ transplantation or anaphylaxis, or<br>
viral infections with human immunodeficiency virus.<br>
Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) is a tumor-associated fetal glycoprotein displaying a wide range of<br>
biological activities, including cell growth regulation, differentiation of immature cells, immuno<br>
suppression of activated immune cells, tumor-specific induction of apoptosis and regulation of<br>
apoptotic signals mediated by other factors, as well as regulation of various gene expressions<br>
(Mizejewsky, (2001) Exp. Biol. Med., v.226(5):377-408). Multiple evidences of cell growth<br>
regulative activities, including tumor suppressive activity, have been reported for various species of<br>
full-length AFP molecul, its proteolytic fragments or recombinant domains and synthetic peptides<br>
(Dudich et al., (1999) Biochemistry, 38: 10406-10414; Jacobson et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA<br>
(2002) 99:2211-2215; MacColl et al. (2001) Biochim. Biophys. Acta, 1528: 127-134). The search<br>
for the localisation of functional active sites of the AFP molecule which are responsible for its<br>
multiple activities has been undertaken by various researchers. Localization of the arachidonic acid<br>
and estradiol binding sites have been successful (reviewed at Mizejewsky, (2001) Exp. Biol. Med.,<br>
v.226(5):377-408).<br>
It was demonstrated recently, that AFP realizes its tumor-suppressive activity by triggering<br>
apoptosis through activation of caspase-3 and independently on Fas/FasL and TNF/TNFR signaling<br>
(Dudich et al., (1999) Eur. J. Biochem. 266: 1-13; Semenkova et al., (2003) Eur. J. Biochem. 270:<br>
276-282.). Multiple evidences of the AFP-mediated tumor cell growth suppression have been<br>
reported at the last decade, but the active site of the AFP molecule that is responsible for apoptosis<br>
signaling has not been identified.<br>
DNA and amino acid sequences of human AFP have been reported (Morinaga, et.al.,"Primary<br>
structures of human alpha-fetoprotein and its mRNA" Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 80:4604-4608<br>
(1983). Synthetic peptides, corresponding to the E2-binding site were shown to possess tumor-<br><br>
suppressive activity (US patents US5674842; 10/1997 Mizejewsky; US5707963, 07/1998<br>
Mizejewsky). Variety of biologically active proteins share a sequence homology with AFP<br>
(Mizejewsky, (2001) Exp. Biol. Med., v.226(5):377-408). There has been identified authentic<br>
homology of AFP with various proteins, involved in apoptosis signaling, such as Bcl2, TNFR1,<br>
Fas, etc. (Mizejewsky, (2001) Exp. Biol. Med, v.226(5):377-408 ). WO 9835981 A1 (Economou, J.<br>
et al., 1998) describes using of 66 AFP peptide sequences to be useful for immunization against<br>
cancer. One of the peptides, A20, was CRGDVLDCL, which incidentally happens to include a part<br>
of the active site of AFP, found by the present invention. However, no special effects by the<br>
peptide CRGDVLDCL was found and the present invention remains to be first one able to identify<br>
one of the putative biologically active sites of AFP. Moreover, the peptides of the present invention<br>
include an additional cysteine residue which enables the formation of inter-chain disulphide bonds<br>
and to produce a significantly higher biological activity than the sequence CRGDVLDCL.<br>
An important integrin binding site is a tripeptide Arg-Gly-Asp, which is present in a variety of<br>
intergrin ligands. Integrins are heterodimeric glycoproteins mediating cell-matrix and cell-cell<br>
interactions and have an active role in the processes of cell differentiation, immune recognition,<br>
tumor development and metastatic growth. Contact regions for the Arg-Gly-Asp sequence have<br>
been identified in the integrin subunits (Pasqualini, et al. J. Cell Biol. (1995)130: 1189-1196).<br>
Synthetic peptides containing the Arg-Gly-Asp motif are used as inhibitors of integrin-ligand<br>
interaction. It has been reported that synthetic peptides containing Arg-Gly-Asp motif are able of<br>
direct caspase-3 activation (Bukley, et al. (1999) Nature, 397: 534-539). AFP contains Arg-Gly-<br>
Asp (RGD) sequence in its sequence that it localized in the domain II in the position 253-255.<br>
According to the present invention, the RGD sequence is a part of the functionally active site of<br>
AFP involved in the apoptosis signaling.<br>
The present invention describes the minimal part of the AFP molecule that is responsible for the<br>
apoptosis signaling. Small peptides or other small haptens are important regulators to be used as<br>
the drugs because they can be synthesized in vitro and they do not produce neutralizing antibodies.<br>
Peptides containing from 6 to 10 residues were produced with the aid of the F-MOC solid phase<br>
chemistry. The similar peptides corresponding to homologous sequences of human serum albumin<br>
(HSA) were also synthesized. All peptides were assessed for their growth regulative activity in<br>
whole cells in culture and also tested for their ability to directly induce caspase activation in cell-<br>
free cytosolic extracts. Additionally, the peptides were assessed for their ability to modulate<br><br>
apoptosis induced by AFP and anti-Fas cytotoxic Mabs CH-11 in whole cells and to affect<br>
cytochrome c -induced caspase activation in cell-free systems.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The subject of invention provides peptides, and in particular, artificial synthetic multimeric cyclic<br>
peptides, capable of regulation of the apoptotic cell death. More specifically, it relates to the<br>
original amino acid sequence on the molecule of human alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) or albumin<br>
responsible for regulation of apoptosis in tumor cells.<br>
AFP is a tumor-associated fetal glycoprotein displaying a wide range of biological activities,<br>
including cell growth regulation, differentiation of immature cells, immuno suppression of<br>
activated immune cells, tumor-specific induction of apoptosis and regulation of apoptotic signals<br>
mediated by other factors, regulation of gene expression. Recently it was shown that AFP can<br>
induce tumor-selective apoptosis via direct or indirect activation of caspase-3 in whole cells and in<br>
a cell-free system (Dudich et al., 1999, J. Eur. Biochem. 266, 750-761; Semenkova et al., (2003)<br>
Eur. J. Biochem. 270: 276-282.). According to the present invention, the active site of such effects<br>
was found in AFP as well as in albumin. The peptides forming the active sites were modeled and a<br>
large number of synthetic natural and non-natural peptides were screened for their biological<br>
activities.<br>
The peptides according to the present invention can be used for inhibition of various types of cell<br>
deaths that are dependent on the cytochrome c-mediated caspase cascade activation, for example,<br>
apoptosis induced by oxidative stress, drugs, cytokines, Fas-ligand, alpha-fetoprotein. The peptides<br>
can be utilized to prevent apoptosis in culturing cells, to increase organ preservation for organ<br>
transplantation, to prevent immunological autoimmune disorders and immunodeficiency syndrome<br>
induced by viral infection, side cytotoxic effects after chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Also<br>
provided are amino acid sequences of the peptides and methods of producing and using the<br>
peptides. The most active structures of the peptides are non-natural synthetic peptides having a<br>
rigid molecular form like:<br><br><br>
The present inventions was undertaken to determine active site of the AFP molecule responsible<br>
for triggering of apoptosis in tumor cells by using theoretical and experimental approaches. It was<br>
made a hypothesis that the active peptide, modeling the active site, might directly induce apoptosis<br>
in whole cells and triggers caspase-3 activation in a cell free system or could modulate apoptotic<br>
signals, induced by AFP and/or other apoptotic factors, such as anti-Fas or cytochrome-c.<br>
Surprisingly a synthetic cyclic peptide *Cys-Cys-Arg-Gly-Asp-Val-Leu-Asp-Cys* (called hereto<br>
as apocyclin-A), modeled a part of the AFP molecule, sharing an authentic homology with several<br>
caspases, appeared to be biologically active. A series of parsings and substitutions of amino acids<br>
in the apocyclin-A sequence was intended to identify the functionally important amino acids. A<br>
large number of peptides related to apocyclin-A were also synthesized. All peptides were tested for<br>
their ability to affect survival of tumor cells in culture and to affect caspase activation in cell-free<br>
cytosolic lysates. The next step of the peptide testing was to study ability of peptides to affect<br>
apoptosis induced by AFP, anti-Fas in whole cells and to modulate caspase activation mediated by<br>
Cyt c in a cell-free system. It was demonstrated that the 9-mer peptide apocyclin-A corresponding<br>
to AFP sequence 251-259 completely abrogated AFP-mediated apoptosis in tumor cells in vitro<br>
and significantly modulates Cyt-c and AFP-mediated caspase activation in cell-free cytosolic<br>
extracts. More specifically, in a cell-free system, apocyclin-A significantly enhanced low-dose<br>
cytochrome c-mediated caspase activation and decreased the high-dose cytochrome c-induced<br>
effects.<br>
A shorter 6-mer peptide p25 partially retained this activity in a cell-free system, but not in<br>
the whole cells. It was also demonstrated that AFP-derived peptides displayed mutual antagonism<br>
in regulating Cyt c-mediated caspase activation in cell extracts. It was observed that 9-mer peptide<br>
apocyclin-A moderately supported low-dose Cyt c-mediated effects and significantly inhibited<br>
caspase activation triggered by high doses of exogenous or endogenous cytochrome c. These data<br>
show that AFP-derived 9-mer peptide apocyclin-A is the minimal part of AFP that is responsible<br>
for the specific binding with unknown cytosolic molecules involved in the apoptosis signaling. The<br>
defined structure of this peptide and its artificial nature imply that it can be the active component of<br>
a new drug which opposes the action of various apoptotic factors in vitro and in vivo. The<br>
applications of this peptide include preventing apoptosis in cultared cells, methods to prevent<br>
immunological rejection of allogenic transplants and autoimmune reactions, methods to avoid<br>
hepatological septic shock and apoptosis induced by cytokine therapy, etc.<br>
The abbreviations for amino acids as used herein are given in the following table:<br><br><br><br>
To find out the minimal part of the AFP molecule that is responsible for apoptosis signaling<br>
peptides containing from 6 to 10 residues were produced via F-MOC solid phase chemistry.<br>
Similar peptides corresponding to the homologous sequence of human serum albumin (HSA) were<br>
also synthesized. All peptides were assessed for their growth regulative activity in whole cells in<br>
culture and also tested for their ability to directly affect caspase activation in cell-free cytosolic<br>
extracts. Additionally the peptides were assessed for their ability to modulate apoptosis induced by<br>
AFP and anti-Fas cytotoxic Mabs CH-11 in whole cells and also to affect cyt c-induced caspase<br>
activation in cell-free system. Artificial cyclic peptide *CCRGDVLDC* (the asterisks denote a<br>
potential disulfide bond) containing the Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) motif corresponding to the 251-259<br>
sequence of human a-fetoprotein (AFP), homologous cyclic peptide with substitution of Cys252 to<br>
Gly *CGRGDVLDC* and linear peptide RGDVLD corresponding to the residues 253-258 were<br>
produced via F-MOC solid phase chemistry. The homologous cyclic peptides from the sequence of<br>
human serum albumin *CCHGDLLEC*, *CGHGDLLEC* and the linear peptide HGDLLE were<br>
also synthesized and used as functional controls. It is to be recognized that peptides containing only<br>
the sequence RCD differ drastically from those of the present invention.<br>
Multimeric cyclic RGD-containing peptide from AFP *CCRGDVLDC* (herein apocyclin-A) is<br>
able to abrogate apoptosis in tumor cells in vitro. It was demonstrated, that apocyclin-A completely<br>
cancelled AFP-induced apoptosis in human myeloblastoma U937 cells and significantly inhibits<br>
anti-Fas-mediated cell death. Further the ability of AFP-derived peptides apocyclin-A and linear 6-<br>
mer peptide RGDVLD to affect caspase activation induced by Cyt c and AFP in a cell-free system<br>
has been assessed. It was found that apocyclin-A notably enhanced dATP-dependent caspase<br>
activation induced by low doses of endogenous or exogenous Cyt c and practically completely<br>
abrogated caspase activation induced by high apoptotically active doses of Cyt c. It was also<br>
demonstrated that apocyclin-A cancelled AFP-induced Cyt c/dATP-dependent caspase-3 activation<br>
in a cell-free cytosolic extracts of HepG2 cells. Linear AFP-derived 6-mer peptide RGDVLD did<br><br>
not revealed any apoptosis-regulating activity in the whole cells, but was able to abrogate Cyt<br>
c/AFP-mediated caspase activation in a cell free system.<br>
It is well known and usually employed approach to rise antibodies against certain functional sites<br>
of biologically active proteins like receptors to block them. Such antibodies create at their Fab units<br>
structures which exactly fit into the receptor site. On the other hand, anti-idiotypic antibodies can<br>
be made to fit the first prepared Fab-units. The anti-idiotypic antibody resembles therefore the<br>
active site of the receptor. According to the present invention, AFP and albumin contain a special<br>
active site, that fits to the receptors triggering the cell death cycle, and blocks them. Therefore, a<br>
certain part of AFP/albumin, found in the present invention, has the structure blocking the<br>
triggering site. The anti-idiotypic antibody against the active site of AFP and/or albumin therefore<br>
contains the essential structural information of the molecule capable of blocking the cell death<br>
receptor. Such 3-D structure can be revealed by a routine X-ray crystallography and/or by<br>
molecular computer modeling from a sequence data.<br>
The basic embodiment of the present invention is that apoptotically active site in two important and<br>
abundant proteins in mammals, viz. AFP and albumin, were found. Based on this finding, a series<br>
of molecular structures were developed for blocking the cell death triggering receptor in<br>
mammalian cells. The tested molecules were peptides because of their easy synthesis but it is<br>
understood that other molecules based on synthetic or natural compounds can be designed. Equally<br>
well, the molecular structures can be constructed on other, especially on non-immunogenic, carrier<br>
molecules.<br>
The main practical result of the present invention is the cyclic peptide from AFP, *CCRGDVLDC*<br>
(apocyclin-A), which contains two functional active sites: RGD and DVLD. Both sequences are<br>
directly involved in the regulation of caspase activity and apoptosis. RGD-containing proteins or<br>
peptides are known to be involved in interaction with integrin molecules and could be employed<br>
for inhibition of intracellular contacts affecting thus cell proliferation and apoptosis. Apocyclin-A<br>
differs from other RGD-containing peptides by multimeric representation of this site in the cyclised<br>
form. This allows enhancing of the total effect by multimeric presentation of the RGD sequence.<br>
The sequence DVLD is located in apocyclin-A just after RGD and represents the well-known<br>
cleavage site for caspase-3, -7, and -2. Therefore, it has a structure typical for caspase substrates,<br>
DXXD (Garcia-Calvo M., et al. (1998) J. Biol. Chem., 32608-13). In apocyclin-A, this site could<br>
bind to the active site of caspase-3 as a peptide substrate. The similar activity could be attributed<br><br>
also to the entire AFP molecule, but this will require conformational change allowing exposure of<br>
corresponding site to reveal apoptosis-modulating activity (Semenkova et al., (2003) Eur. J.<br>
Biochem. 270: 276-282).<br>
The ability of the apocyclin-A to inhibit activity of caspase-3 in a cell-free system could be<br>
explained by the presence of the substrate-like amino acid sequence, which is capable binding to<br>
and blocking the active sites of corresponding caspases. Additionally, DVLD-site of apocyclin-A<br>
could selectively facilitate the release of caspase-3 from the apoptosome complex by disturbing an<br>
interaction between XIAP and processed caspase-3 similarly to the typical tetrapeptide caspase-3<br>
inhibitor DEVD-cho (Bratton, S. B., et al., (2001) EMBO J. 5:998).<br>
The unique nature of apocyclin-A is its cyclic structure, which allows multimeric presentation of<br>
the substrate sequence and enhancing of the total effect by the simultaneous interaction with<br>
different molecules involved in apoptosis signaling.<br>
The invention is illustrated further below by the non-limiting examples.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
Peptide synthesis<br>
The peptides were synthesized with a synthesizer Model 430A; Applied Biosystems, Foster City,<br>
CA, USA, according to usual methods of peptide syntheses. The cyclic peptides primarily form<br>
spontaneously from linear peptides in water solutions subjected to atmospheric oxygen and were<br>
purified from the solution by HPLC with common procedures used for peptides.<br>
1. Cyclic multimeric 9-mer peptide corresponding to the 251-259 amino acid sequence of the<br>
human AFP *Cys-*Cys-Arg-Gly-Asp-Val-Leu-Asp-Cys*, *CCRGDVLDC* (the asterisks denote<br>
a potential disulfide bond), that will be termed herein as apocyclin-A. The second cysteine,<br>
Cys252, is capable of forming the S-S bond between two adjacent cyclic monomeric peptides.<br>
Molecular weight of the monomeric cyclic peptide was 983 Da. The apocyclin-A peptide is<br>
composed of two or more (less than 5) ring-like 9-mer peptide structures corresponding to the<br>
sequence *Cys-*Cys-Arg-Gly-Asp-Val-Leu-Asp-Cys*.<br><br><br>
2. Cyclic monomeric peptide *Cys-Gly-Arg-Gly-Asp-Val-Leu-Asp-Cys* (the asterisks denote a<br>
potential disulfide bond), corresponding to the 251-259 amino acid sequence of the human AFP<br>
with a single amino acid substitution of the Cys252 for Gly to avoid peptide multimerisation by<br>
formation of the S-S bonds between the monomers. Molecular weight of the monomeric cyclic 9-<br>
mer peptide was 937 Da.<br>
3. Linear peptide from AFP corresponding to the sequence 253-259, Arg-Gly-Asp-Val-Leu-Asp<br>
(253-259), Molecular weight of the monomeric cyclic peptide was 674 Da.<br>
4. Cyclic peptide from HSA (human serum albumin) *Cys-Cys-His-Gly-Asp-Leu-Leu-Glu-Cys*,<br>
*CCHGDLLEC* (M.wt: 992);<br>
5. Cyclic peptide from HSA *Cys-Gly-His-Gly-Asp-Leu-Leu-Glu-Cys*, CGHGDLLEC (M.wt:<br>
946). In this peptide Cys252 is substituted by Gly.<br>
6. Linear peptide from HSA p26: His-Gly-Asp-Leu-Leu-Glu, HGDLLE (M.wt: 683).<br>
Reagents<br>
Fluorogenic peptide substrates DEVD-AMC and LEHD-AFC were from Alexis Biochemicals (San<br>
Diego, USA). Bovine heart cytochrome c (Cyt c), adenylic nucleotide triphosphate (dATP) and<br>
other reagents were obtained from Sigma Chemical Co. Human AFP was isolated from the cord<br>
serum using ion-exchange, affinity, and gel-filtration chromatography as described in (Dudich et<br>
al., (1999) Biochemistry, 38: 10406-10414). AFP purity was established by PAGE and Rocket<br>
electrophoresis with monospecific antibodies against human AFP and adult serum proteins and was<br>
shown to be not less than 99.8%.<br>
Preparation of cell-free extracts<br>
HepG2, human hepatocarcinoma cells and human monoblastoma cell line U937 originated from<br>
American Type Culture Collection. Cell extracts were prepared by lysing cells in a hypotonic<br>
extraction buffer. To obtain the cytosolic S-100 fraction, the cell lysate was centrifuged for 1 h at<br>
100,000xg. Extracts were either used immediately or frozen at -70°C for later use.<br><br>
Cell-free reactions<br>
Cell-free reactions were typically set up in 13-µl reaction volumes. Apoptosis was induced by<br>
addition of various doses of bovine heart cytochrome c and/or purified human AFP in the presence<br>
of 1 mM dATP. For 13-µl scale reactions, 10 µl of cell extract (~2-4 mg/ml, as determined by the<br>
Bradford assay) were supplemented with 1 µl of dATP, 1 µl of Cyt c and/or AFP solutions in<br>
reaction buffer to receive necessary final concentration of reagents. To assess activity of peptides,<br>
various doses of peptides being dissolved in the reaction buffer together with 1 mM dATP were<br>
added to the cell extracts. To determine ability of the peptides to modulate apoptotic effects of Cyt<br>
c and AFP, peptides were added to extracts 10 min before cytochrome c or AFP. Control samples<br>
were incubated with the equal volume of the buffer (3 µl) without reagent addition. To initiate<br>
apoptosis, extracts were incubated at 37°C for 40 min.<br>
Determination of caspase activity<br>
At the end of a caspase activation reaction, extract aliquots (5 µl) were supplemented with<br>
fluorogenic substrate DEVD-AMC (3 mM) and then incubated for definite time intervals (0.5-1 h)<br>
at 37 °C. Reactions were terminated by dilution with addition of 2.0 ml of ice-cold 0.2 mM sodium<br>
phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, followed by a measurement of fluorescence with a Perkin Elmer MPF-<br>
44A (?exc= 365 nm and ?ern = 440 nm ) fiuorometer. For each sample, the fluorescence intensity<br>
was normalized in the respect of cytosolic protein concentration. Caspase activation was presented<br>
as the ratio between the normalized fluorescence intensity of the sample and the corresponding<br>
value measured with a control sample.<br>
Induction of apoptosis<br>
U937 cells were plated out at a density of 4 x 103 cells/well in flat-bottom 96-well plates (Costar)<br>
in the complete medium and incubated for 2 h before reagent additions. Then cells were treated for<br>
24 h with various doses of AFP dissolved in PBS and then assessed for proliferation. Cell treatment<br>
with cytotoxic IgM anti-Fas antibody CH-11 was performed as described. U937 cells were treated<br>
with 50 ng/ml of CH-11 antibodies for 18 h. Cells were left untreated or were treated with reagents<br>
for adequate time intervals and for the last 4 h of culture were subjected to their [3H]-thymidine (1<br>
Ci/mmol/well) incorporation. Experimental data were expressed as a percentage of [3H]-thymidine<br>
incorporation in triplicate cultures relative to the medium control. Cells, cultivated without<br>
additions, were taken as a control.<br><br>
Assay for peptide activity<br>
To assess growth regulative activity of peptides various doses of peptides were added to the cells<br>
for 24 h and then the cells were assessed for proliferation, cell viability and DNA-fragmentation.<br>
To determine ability of peptides to modulate apoptosis induced by other factors Jurkat cells were<br>
treated with 20 ng/ml of CH-11 antibodies without ActD, Raji cells were treated with CH-11 in the<br>
Jurkat cells were treated with 20 ng/ml of CH-11 antibodies without ActD, Raji cells were treated<br>
with CH-11 in the presence of 0.5 µg/ml of ActD for 18 h. For induction of apoptosis with TNF-?,<br>
cells (Jurkat, MCF7 or U937) were treated for 24 h with 25 ng/ml of the cytokine and then were<br>
assessed for proliferation or viability as described above. HepG2 cells were pre-washed before<br>
TNF addition with fresh medium to remove endogenous growth factors.<br>
EXAMPLE 2 Identification of caspase-3 specific RGD-containing active site in human AFP<br>
responsible for apoptosis signaling<br>
To determine functionally important amino acids in the AFP molecule we determined the amino<br>
acid homology of the sequence of human AFP and caspases-3 and -1 and constructed the structures<br>
of peptide analogues of the proposed active site. The following sequences were studied aligned:<br><br>
It is seen from the alignment that AFP has certain homology with enzymatic active sites of<br>
caspases 1 and 3. Enzymatically active sites of caspases 1 and 2 contain RGD motif that is<br>
localized in before catalytically active Cys residue. Effector caspases 3 and 7 have in this place<br>
RGT motif, but the positions of Cys residues exactly coincide in AFP molecule and in casp-3 and<br>
casp-7. Taking into account that AFP has inter-chain disulfide bond between Cys252 and Cys259<br>
(Morinaga, et. al., (1983) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.USA, 80:4604-4608), we made a hypothesis of<br>
localization of the caspase-like active site on the AFP molecule somewhere between residues<br>
Cys251-Cys259. It has to be mentioned that casp-3, -7, and -8 also have RGD motifs, but they are<br>
localized at the other than catalytically active positions (Bukley, et al. (1999) Nature, 397: 534-<br>
539). Free cysteines Cys258 in the content of the peptide structure evidently could form interchain<br>
disulfide bonds between two adjacent peptides (Fig. 1). To prove the existence of functionally<br><br>
important amino acids in the Cys251-Cys259 loop in AFP molecule, we constructed the structures of<br>
peptide analogues of the proposed active site. For the control, homologous peptides from HSA<br>
have been also synthesized.<br>
EXAMPLE 3 Cyclic peptide from AFP apocyclin-A cancels AFP-induced apoptosis in U937 cells<br>
Previous published data demonstrate that AFP from different origins (embryonic or derived from<br>
the culture medium of hepatoma cell line HepG2) can induce dose-dependent growth suppression<br>
and programmed cell death in various tumor cell lines, characterized by classical features of<br>
apoptosis, such as significant growth suppression, cytotoxicity and DNA-fragmentation (Dudich et<br>
al., 1999, J. Eur. Biochem. 266, 750-761). To determine possible localization of the active site on<br>
the AFP molecule that is responsible for apoptosis signaling we tested ability of various AFP-<br>
derived peptides to block this effect. Fig. 2 demonstrates that AFP-derived peptide apocyclin-A<br>
completely abrogates AFP-induced apoptosis in U-937 cells. Moreover, 15-min pre-treatment of U-<br>
937 cells with apocyclin-A (1 mM) induced 15% stimulation of proliferation relatively to the<br>
medium control. That means that apocyclin-A abrogates also spontaneous apoptosis of the cells<br>
during 24-h cultivation.<br>
EXAMPLE 4 Apocyclin-A significantly inhibits anti-Fas-induced apoptosis in U-937 cells<br>
To test AFP-specificity, we tested whether apocyclin-A could affect apoptosis induced by other<br>
factors. The apoptosis was induced in U-937 cells by various doses of cytotoxic IgM anti-Fas<br>
monoclonal antibodies CH-11. Fig. 3 demonstrates that 0.5 mM apocyclin-A significantly inhibited<br>
anti-Fas-mediated apoptosis by abrogation of about 50% of the total effect. Enhance of the<br>
apocyclin-A concentration up to 1 mM induced more significant inhibition of the anti-Fas-induced<br>
apoptosis. It is known that intracellular pathways engaged in various types of apoptosis are<br>
common for majority of apoptotic factors. Our data indicated that apocyclin-A counteracts with<br>
AFP- and Fas-dependent pathways of apoptosis signaling by interaction with certain common<br>
receptor that is engaged by the both factors to signal apoptosis.<br>
EXAMPLE 5 Determination of the functionally important amino acids in the active site of the<br>
AFP molecule:<br>
a) AFP-derived peptides<br>
Cyclic peptide *CGRGDVLDC* with substitution of Cys252 to Gly and 6-mer peptide RGDVLD<br>
were designed to determine functionally important amino acids in the sequence of the functional<br>
active site that is responsible for apoptosis signaling. Fig 4 demonstrates the effect of<br><br>
*CGRGDVLDC* on the AFP-mediated apoptosis in U-937 cells. This peptide failed to abrogate<br>
AFP-mediated cytotoxicity. The same results were obtained for RGDVLD (Fig. 4). These data<br>
indicate that Cys252 is functionally important amino acid and its substitution to Gly completely<br>
abrogates ability of the peptide to interact with apoptotic activity of the entire AFP molecule. The<br>
shorter peptide, RGDVLD, was also incapable of regulation of the AFP-mediated apoptosis,<br>
showing necessity of cyclic structure for formation of apoptotic active site.<br>
b) HSA-derived peptides<br>
Albumin is known to share authentic homology with AFP (Morinaga , et al., Proc. Natl. Acad.<br>
Sci. USA, 80:4604-4608). There was also found a homology in the region of proposed active site<br>
that was modeled by peptide apocyclin-A. We designed following peptides from HSA sequence:<br>
cyclic peptides *CCHGDLLEC*, *CGHGDLLEC* (with a single constitution of Cys to Gly) and<br>
linear 6-mer peptide HGDLLE. We also tested the ability of these peptides to affect AFP-induced<br>
apoptosis in whole cells similarly as described above (Table 1). Fig. 5 demonstrates that<br>
*CCHGDLLEC* have similar to apocyclin-A activity to abrogate AFP-mediated apoptosis in U-<br>
937 cells. HGDLLE and *CGHGDLLEC* did not affect cell response to AFP.<br>
Table 1. Effects of AFP-derived and HSA-derived peptides on the cell growth and AFP-<br>
induced apoptosis in U-937 cells.<br><br>
EXAMPLE 6 Apocyclin-A synergizes with low suboptimal doses of endogenous cytochrome c to<br>
induce caspase activation in a cell-free system<br>
To determine whether apocyclin-A could operate similarly to the entire AFP molecule to support<br>
caspase activation in a cell-free system, we established the same cell-free system, as described<br>
above, but instead of AFP the cyclic peptide apocyclin-A have been used. Fig. 8 demonstrates that<br>
apocyclin-A synergistically enhanced the total caspase-3 activity in a cell-free system in the<br>
presence of the low suboptimal doses of endogenous cytochrome c and dATP. Without dATP<br><br>
addition apocyclin-A was unable to induce DEVD-ase activity in the same experimental<br>
conditions. The same effect was observed for the entire AFP in the "silent" cell-free extracts. These<br>
data shows that we were able to identify the active site of AFP and albumin responsible for their<br>
apoptosis-promoting activity.<br>
EXAMPLE 7 AFP synergizes with suboptimal doses of cytochrome c and dATP to induce<br>
caspase-3 activation in cytosolic cell extracts<br>
We have tested further the ability of AFP to induce caspase activity in a cell-free system. Addition<br>
of AFP to the S100 cytosolic extract triggered dATP-dependent induction of caspase-3-specific<br>
DEVDase activity, which progressively increased for at least 2 h (Fig. 7A). As a control, the<br>
equivalent amount of human serum albumin (HSA) was added into the same cell-free system and<br>
showed no effect at the level of the DEVDase activity. A low degree of DEVDase activity was also<br>
caused by dATP alone and was evidently due to the presence of a small amount of endogenous cyt-<br>
c in the preparations. In the absence of dATP, AFP did not induce any caspase activation at all. To<br>
determine, whether AFP can directly induce caspase activation in cytosolic cell extracts, or it<br>
requires presence of a basal level of cyt-c, we examined DEVDase cleavage activity after addition<br>
of exogenous cyt-c to the "silent" cytosolic extracts with undetectable level of endogenous<br>
cytochrome c. Fig. 7B shows that no DEVDase activity was detected in this type of cytosolic<br>
lysates even after two hours of treatment in the presence of dATP and low suboptimal dose of cyt-<br>
c. However, addition of AFP (7 uM) in the same reaction system triggered the process of caspase<br>
activation, which progressively increased in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 7B).<br>
EXAMPLE 8 Abrogation of the Cyt c/AFP-mediated caspase activation in a cell-free system by<br>
apocyclin-A<br>
Fig. 8 shows that the effects of apocyclin-A on the caspase-3 activation were mediated by various<br>
doses of cytochrome c and AFP. High dose of the peptide (750 µM) significantly (50-70%)<br>
inhibited caspase activation induced by high doses of endogenous cytochrome c (Fig. 8A). The<br>
combined treatment of cytosolic fraction with cytochrome c/AFP resulted in a significant enhance<br>
of the total DEVDase activity (Fig 8, A and B). Addition of apocyclin-A inhibited Cyt c/AFP-<br>
mediated caspase activation by 60-80%. These data indicate that apocyclin-A operates in a cell-free<br>
system in the manner opposite to the entire AFP molecule, by abrogation of the total caspase-<br>
activation effect induced by cyt c alone or in composition with AFP. Therefore, apocyclin-A<br>
represents the sequence on the AFP molecule that is responsible for its apoptotic activity and for<br>
the interaction with the members of the apoptosome assembly.<br><br>
EXAMPLE 9 Effects of AFP-derived and HSA-derived peptides on the dATP-dependent Cyt c-<br>
mediated caspase activation in cell-free cytosolic extracts<br>
To test ability of various peptides to affect caspase activation induced by exogenous cytochrome c<br>
in cell free system, we used cytosolic cell extracts of HepG2 cells. Aliquots of cell extracts were<br>
pre-treated with 750 µM of peptides for 15 min and thereafter various doses of cytochrome c were<br>
introduced in the reaction mixture to induce caspase activation. Control extracts were incubated<br>
with dATP without peptides and cytochrome c but it did not reveal any caspase activity. It is seen<br>
from Fig. 9 A that the peptides from AFP, 9-mer peptide apocyclin-A and 6-mer peptide RGDVLD<br>
as well as 6-mer peptide from HSA, HGDLLE induced significant inhibition of high dose<br>
cytochrome c-mediated caspase activation. On the other hand, cyclic monomeric 9-mer peptide<br>
with a single amino acid substitution *CGRGDVLDC*, as well as cyclic multimeric peptide from<br>
HSA *CCHGDLLEC*, showed no activity of inhibiting apoptosis either in whole cells or in a cell-<br>
free system. Hence, the most potent peptide apocyclin-A mimicks the active site of AFP, which is<br>
responsible for the apoptosis signaling. Distinctly different effect was obtained for the low dose<br>
cytochrome c-induced caspase activation. Fig. 9B shows that apocyclin-A produced the same<br>
stimulation as full-length AFP molecule at low dose cytochrome c-induced caspase activation.<br>
Peptides *CGRGDVLDC* and *CCHGDLLEC* had no effect on the low-dose cytochrome c<br>
activity, but peptides RGDVLD and HGDLLE demonstrated significant abrogation of the<br>
cytochrome c-induced caspase activation.<br>
Table 2 summarizes experimental data characterizing activity of peptides in cell-free<br>
cytosolic extracts.<br>

free system.<br><br><br>
EXAMPLE 10 Preparation of anti-idiotypic antibodies against the biologically active site of AFP<br>
BALB/cA mice were used for immunization, cell fusion and production of ascites fluid. Twenty<br>
mice were immunized each with a highly purified human AFP (40 µg) emulsified with complete<br>
Freund's adjuvant. The mice were boosted at 2-week intervals with the same amount of AFP<br>
emulsified in incomplete Freund's adjuvant. The mice with the highest response against human<br>
AFP were selected and 80 ug of AFP in 100 µl of AFP solution involving 50 µl of Freund's<br>
incomplete adjuvant was intravenously injected into their tails. Three days later spleen cells were<br>
prepared and mixed with mouse myeloma NS-1 cells followed by the treastment with PEG in the<br>
KC medium containing FCS. The fusion cells were grown in HAT medium containing FCS<br>
followed by cultivation in HT medium. The hybridomas were tested for their production of<br>
antibodies with a TR-FIA assay involving rabbit polyclonal antibody as an immobilized capturing<br>
antibody and an Eu-labeled anti-human antibody as the monitoring antibody (for technical details<br>
and reagents, see the publication Peuravuori, H and Korpela, T. et al. Clin.Chem. 1993, 39, pp. 847-<br>
848). Among the antibody producing clones, those which were not sensitive to addition of peptide<br>
*CCRGDVLDC* and its cyclic forms were discarded. Clones showing a good response were<br>
grown enough to be introduced for ascites fluid production in mice. The ascites fluid was prepared<br>
and anti-AFP monoclonal antibodies were purified from it. The purified antibodies were subjected<br>
to proteolysis to obtain pure Fab fragments from selected clones by commonly known methods (for<br>
techniques, see paper by Muronetz and Korpela, J.Chromatogr. 2003, 790, pp. 53-66). The Fab-<br>
protein was subjected to a similar process as AFP, described above, to obtain monospecific<br>
antibodies against the Fab fragments. Those anti-idiotypic antibodies against AFP active site were<br>
screened out from the clones by their sensitivity to the active site peptides of AFP. The anti-<br>
idiotypic antibody against the active site of human albumin at the sequence position 246-254 could<br>
be made essentially by the same techniques as against AFP described above.<br><br>

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides structures of small molecules capable of modulating apoptotic cell<br>
death. More specifically, the structures relate to the structures of apoptotic active sites of<br>
mammalian alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and albumin. Peptides mimicking the active site contain two<br>
sequences, Arg-Gly-Asp and Asp-X-X-Asp, wherein X means any amino acid. These sequences<br>
are needed in the same molecule for causing a wide range of biological activities. The peptides can<br>
be utilized to suppress apoptotic pathways by inhibiting the cytochrome c-mediated caspase<br>
activation. Thus, the peptides can be used to inhibit effects of apoptosis induced by oxidative<br>
stress, drugs, cytokines, Fas-ligand, alpha-fetoprotein, used to prevent apoptosis in culturing cells,<br>
in organ transplantation, in immunological autoimmune disorders and immunodeficiency syndrom<br>
induced by viral infection, or to diminish side cytotoxic effects after chemotherapy and radiation<br>
therapy.<br>
