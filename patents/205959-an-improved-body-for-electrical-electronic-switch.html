THE PATENTS ACT, 1970 (39 of 1970)<br>
COMPLETE SPECIFICATION (See Section 10, rule 13)<br>
AN IMPROVED ELECTRICAL SWITCH<br>
MAMOJ HANSRAJ GADA and HANSRAJ SHIVAJI GADA both of 5, SATI INDUSTRIAL ESTATE I. B. PATEL ROAD, GOREGAON (EAST), MUMBAI-4 00 063 MAHARASHTRA, India INDIANS<br><br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed : -<br><br><br><br>
AN IMPROVED ELECTRICAL SWITCH<br>
The invention relates to an improved electiical switch. More particularly the invention relates to an improved electrical switch having centrally hinged switch knobs of oval shaped made from plastic mouldable material.<br>
The conventional switches consisting of a body portion and a switch knob. The OFF/ON position of the knob is not working smoothly and thereby the spring inside the knob becomes ineffective and thereby the switch is damaged requires frequent replacement. The inventor has done a lot research on this and found there is a need to develop an improved electrical switch having improved knob which does not damage the spring easily.<br>
The primary object of this invention is therefore to provide an unproved electrical switch wherein the switch knob is not damaged easily. Another object of this invention is to provide an improved electrical switch wherein the spring provided inside the knob is long lasting, safe and economic.<br>
Accordingly there is provided an improved electiical switch having a front surface and a bottom surface and a knob member which placed between the cential grooves provided at the back of front surface so that the knob member fitted from the back protiude at the front surface through the grooves of the front surface; the said grooves is oval shaped; the said knob member of oval shape, boat hke structure having two projections at its outer flanges which sits in the grooves of the front surface from the back; the said knob member is provided with two spring member inside the recess; the said spring member is held by v-shaped member which is pivoted on a brass piece; the said brass piece is also having projections at two ends and centially placed in the grooves of the bottom member which are fitted tiltably; said bottom member is assembled along with knob member from the back on the front surface by screwing means the brass pieces are connected to the bottom member thereby providing a electiical switch with long lasting knob.<br><br>
The invention will now be clear with reference to figures 1 to 6 in the accompanying specification.<br>
Figure 1 is a front view of the front surface showing the openings for the knob fitted from the back along with the grooves for fastening screws.<br>
Figure 2 is a side view of the improved electrical switch showing the front surface and bottom surface and the knob member and the brass pieces.<br>
Figtue 3 is a knob member which having projections to sit on the grooves of the front surface from the back.<br>
figure 4 is a sectional view of the bottom member showing the grooves on which a brass piece is tiltably mounted to assist the knob member for smooth OFF/ON position.<br>
Figure 5 is a knob member which having projections to sit on the grooves of the front surface from the back having two spring member connected with a pivot piece.<br>
Figure 6 is a back view of front surface<br>
The invention wiU be described with reference to figures 1 to 6 in the accompanying drawings.<br>
Referring to figures 1 to 6 the improved electrical switch (1) consisting of mainly three parts. Electrical switch (1) front surface (2), bottom surface (3) and knob member (4) made froni the mouldable plastic material wherein the knob member is tiltably mounted in between of the front and back surface by means of grooves and projections with pivotal moxuiting so as to avoid jerk on the spring members provided inside the boat Uke structure, oval shaped knob member which will prevent frequent damages of spring of the knob member.<br><br>
An improved electrical switch (1) having a front surface (2) and a bottom surface (3) and a knob member (4) which placed between the central groove (5) provided at the back of front surface so that the knob member fitted from the back will protrude at the front surface through the groove of the front surface; the said groove is oval shaped; the said knob memiber of oval shape, boat like structure having two projections (6) at its outer flanges which seats in the grooves (12) of the front surface from the back; the said knob member is provided with two spring member (7) inside the recess; the said spring member is held by v-shaped member (8) which is pivoted on a brass piece (9); the said brass piece is also having projections (10) at ITVO ends and centrally placed in the grooves of the bottom member which are fitted tiltably; said bottom member is assembled along with knob member from the back on the front surface by screwing means; the brass pieces (11) are connected to the bottom member thereby providing a electrical switch with long lasting knob.<br>
This is an embodiment of the invention. Several modifications are possible may be considered within the ambit and spirit of this invention. Since many modifications, variations and changes in detail may be made to the above described embodiments, it is intended that all matters described in the foregoing description as described ia the accompanying specification.<br><br>
We Claim:<br>
1. An improved electrical switch (1) having a front surface (2) and a bottom surface (3) and a knob member (4) which placed between the central groove (5) provided at the back of front surface so that the knob member fitted from the back will protrude at the front surface through the groove of the front surface; the said groove is oval shaped; the said knob member of oval shape, boat like sti-ucture having two projections (6) at its outer flanges which seats in the grooves (12) of the front surface from the back; the said knob member is provided with two spring member (7) inside the recess; the said spring member is held by v-shaped member (8) which is pivoted on a brass piece (9); the said brass piece is also having projections (10) at two ends and centrally placed in the grooves of the bottom member which are fitted tiltably; said bottom member is assembled along with knob member from the back on the front surface by screwing means; the brass pieces (11) are connected to the bottom member thereby providing a electrical switch with long lasting knob.<br>
