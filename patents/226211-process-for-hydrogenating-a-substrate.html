				<td>Catalytic hvdroaenation of carfaon-heteroatom double bonds<br>
The present invention relates to processes for catalytically hydrogenating carbon-heteroatoms double bonds, in particular for asymmetrically catalytically hydrogenating simple ketones, using ruthenium complexes which each have a monophosphine ligand and a bidentate P-N ligand.<br>
The possibilities for reducing carbon-heteroatom double bonds which are relevant from an industrial viewpoint are firstly transfer hydrogenation and secondly hydrogenation with molecular hydrogen. A prerequisite for both processes is the presence of catalysts for activating the particular reducing agent. The hydrogenation activities achievable in transfer hydrogenations are in principle less promising as a result of circumstances relating to the process (need for large amounts of solvent) than in the hydrogenation with molecular hydrogen. Since, however, molecular hydrogen is significantly more difficult to activate than an alcohol, which serves as the reducing agent in the transfer hydrogenation, some catalyst systems for transfer hydrogenation have in recent times become known, but only comparatively few catalyst systems for hydrogenation with hydrogen. In particular, only very few catalyst systems are known hitherto for substrates in the form of simple ketones. Simple ketones are those ketones which have no functional groups, or more precisely no heteroatoms, in the relative vicinity of the carbonyl group, as is the case, for example, in a~ keto esters and amides, p-keto esters or amino, hydroxy and phenylthio ketones.<br>
The first example of an efficient catalyst system for the catalytic H2 hydrogenation of nonfunctionalized ketones is described by R. Noyori and T. Ohkuma in Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2001, 40, 40ff. This is a process for asymmetrically hydrogenating simple carbonyl compounds with hydrogen gas under a pressure of up to 50 bar using a homogeneous Ru(ll) complex of the CI2Ru(PR3)3 type, in the presence of isopropanol, of a molar excess of a base, and of a nitrogen-containing organic compound in the form of a primary, secondary or tertiary monoamine, or preferably a diamine. The catalytic precursors obtained are 6-coordinate (CI)2Ru(phosphine)2(NAN) and (CI)2Ru(PAP)(NAN) complexes. The efficient action of these complexes is attributed to the properties of the amine ligand which, during the catalysis process, functions on the one hand as a hydrogen atom donor for the reduction of the substrate and on the other hand as a hydrogen atom acceptor for the activation of the<br><br>
molecular hydrogen (R. Noyori and T. Ohkuma in Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2001,40, 40ff and R. H. Morris, Organometallics 2000,19, 2655).<br>
The second, later example of a further class of catalysts which enable the hydrogenation of simple ketones is described in WO 02/22526 A2. This describes the preparation of 6-coordinate ruthenium complexes having two bidentate ligands but no amine ligands. The two bidentate ligands are either an NAP ligand in combination with a PAP ligand, or alternatively two NAP ligands.<br>
It is noticeable in the aforementioned examples that, although the complexes have different phosphorus and nitrogen ligands, there are no differences with regard to the coordination sphere on the central ruthenium atom, since the complexes mentioned always have 6-fold coordination. The nature of the ligand sphere around the particular central atom of a complex is known to exert a great influence on the possible activity of the complex.<br>
It has now been found that suitable catalyst precursors for the catalytic hydrogenation of simple ketones with hydrogen are also 5-coordinate ruthenium complexes whose ligands are one monophosphine and one bidentate PAN ligand.<br>
The present invention therefore provides a process for hydrogenating a substrate containing a carbon-heteroatom double bond, which includes the step of reacting the substrate with hydrogen in the presence of a hydrogenation catalyst and of a base, characterized in that the hydrogenation catalyst is a transition metal complex of the formula (I)<br>

The aforementioned process is suitable for highly selectively hydrogenating ketones to prepare the corresponding optically pure alcohols.<br>
Suitable substrates are ketones of the general formula (S):<br>

The carbonyl function to be reduced may also be incorporated into a mono- or polycyclic ring structure. Although a feature of the process according to the invention is that nonfunctionalized ketones in particular can also be hydrogenated, the Ra and Rb radicals may each independently have functional groups. The only restriction for these is that they do not react with the catalyst to destroy it.

C2.sAlkoxyalkyls mean radicals in which the alkyl chain is interrupted by at least one oxygen function, although two oxygen atoms may not be joined together. The number of carbon atoms indicates the total number of carbon atoms present in the radical. All structural isomers are included.<br>
C3.8Cycloalkyl radical refers to cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl and<br>
cycloheptyl radicals, etc. Cycloalkyl radicals substituted by heteroatoms are preferably, for<br>
example, 1-, 2-, 3-, 4-piperidyl, 1-, 2-, 3-pyrrolidinyl, 2-, 3-tetrahydrofuryl, 2-, 3-, 4-<br>
morpholinyl.<br>

Hal is fluorine, chlorine, bromine, iodine, preferably chlorine. Organohalogen compounds is the collective term used for compounds containing, in addition to carbon, elements of the halogen group, including fluorine, chlorine, bromine and iodine. An example is the CF3 group.<br>
The specific bidentate P-Z-N ligands of the general formula (II) and their preparation are known in principle from the literature. Some references are cited in the experimental section. The transition metal complexes of the general formula (I) may if desired be prepared "in situ" in the reaction mixture which contains the substrate to be hydrogenated, or may initially be isolated before a hydrogenation. The preparative process of the complexes is in principle the same. When preparing the complexes, the P-Z-N ligand is in principle introduced stoichiometrically.<br>
The transition metal complexes of the general formula (I) may advantageously be used to hydrogenate simple ketones in particular. Indeed even simple ketones which do not contain a coordinating heteroatom nearby the carbonyl group can be hydrogenated with high activity and enantioselectivity. In the light of the high activity of the catalyst, reduction of non prochiral ketone to make achiral alcohol can be also of practical interest for cost efficient synthesis of secondary alcohol.<br>
The hydrogenation is typically effected in compositions comprising a complex of the formula (I), the substrate, a base and optionally a solvent Hydrogen is then injected to this composition under the desired pressure and at the desired temperature. The hydrogenation conditions to be selected follow in principle from the customary conditions and essential process parameters such as pressure, temperature, concentration of substrate and catalyst, solvent, bases, which are known from the prior art. The process conditions outlined below have only exemplary character<br>
The concentration range of the complexes based on the substrate may vary widely. In general, based on the substrate, between 0.1 and 50 000 ppm are used. This corresponds to a substrate/complex ratio (S/C) of 107 to 20.<br>
The bases used may be any inorganic or organic bases customarily used in hydrogenation. Mention is made only of alkali metal and alkaline earth metal hydroxides, alkoxides and carbonates, and quaternary ammonium salts. Preference is given to using KOH, KOMe,<br><br>
KOiPr, KOtBu, LJOH, LiOMe, LiOiPr, NaOH, NaOMe or NaOiPr. The bases may be used in solid form or dissolved in alcohol or preferably in water, for example KOtBu/tBuOH (1 molar) or NaOH/H20 (1 molar). In addition, the bases used may be used within a large concentration range. In molar equivalents of base, expressed relative to the metal complex (B/M), the ratio may be about 0.5 to 50 000, preferably 2 to 10 000.<br>
The process according to the invention can be carried out without or in the presence of an inert solvent. Suitable solvents are, for example, aliphatic, cycloaliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons (pentane, hexane, petroleum ether, cyclohexane, methylcyclohexane, benzene, toluene, xylene), aliphatic halohydrocarbons (methylene chloride, chloroform, di-and tetrachloroethane), nitriles (acetonitrile, propionitrile, benzonitrile), ethers (diethyl ether, dibutyl ether, t-butyl methyl ether, ethylene glycol dimethyl ether, ethylene glycol diethyl ether, diethylene glycol dimethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran or dioxane), ketones (acetone, methyl isobutyl ketone), carboxylic esters and lactones (ethyl or methyl acetate, valerolactone), N-substituted lactams (N-methylpyrrolidone), carboxamides (dimethylacetamide, dimethylformamide), acyclic ureas (tetramethylurea) or cyclic ureas (dimethylimidazolidinone), and sulphoxides and sulphones (dimethyl sulphoxide, dimethyl sulphone, tetramethylene sulphoxide, tetramethylene sulphone) and alcohols (methanol, ethanol, propanol, butanol, ethylene glycol monoethyl ether, diethylene glycol monomethyl ether) and water. The solvents may be used alone or in a mixture of at least two solvents. Preference is given to using toluene.<br>
The hydrogenation process according to the invention may be carried out at typical pressures of 10 x 103 to 10 x 105 Pa (1 to 100 bar). Advantageously, 20 x 104 to 85 x 10" (20 to 85 bar), in particular 80 x 104 Pa (80 bar), are used.<br>
The hydrogenation reactions are typically carried out at standard room temperature, i.e. between about 20"C and 35Â°C. However, depending mainly on the solvents used, or more specifically the solubility behaviour of the reactants used, the selected temperature may also be between about 0Â°C and 100Â°C.<br>

The solution is cooled to -70Â°C and it becomes yellow and cloudy. A syringe is used to slowrfy (over about 10 min) add n-BuLi (1.6 M hexane, 5.5 ml, 8.8 mmol), while keeping the temperature of the reaction mixture below -65ÂºC. After the addition, the mixture is stirred at -70Â°C for 2 hours, the dry ice bath is removed and the reaction solution is stirred at 0-5Â°C for a further 15 min. A syringe is now used to slowly (over about 10 min) add 3.5 g of PCI(xylyl)2, 12.6 mmol. The now daxk orange-coloured solution is stirred at room temperature for about 15 min, and 50 ml of diethyl ether are subsequently added. The reaction is now stopped by adding 30 ml of a saturated NaHCO3 solution. Extraction is effected 3 times with 50 ml each time of EtOAc, and the combined organic phases are dried over Na2S04. After removing the solvents on a rotary evaporator, 3.3 g of an orange-brown-coloured oil are obtained. This is purified by column chromatography (240 g of SiOj, 4:1 heptane/ethyl acetate) to obtain 1.5 g of a pure orange-coloured crystalline product Yield: 1.5 g, 46% of theory).<br>

Procedure for the experiments:<br>
All reactions were carried out using Schlenk technology and under protective gas atmosphere.<br>
General hydrooenation:<br>
After an appropriate pre-treatment, the particular catalyst solution is transferred to the inertized 50 ml mini-autoclave (inject argon and decompress 3 x), and the starting material (substrate) and the base are subsequently added. Afterwards, the autoclave is sealed and hydrogen is injected to the desired pressure. The reaction is started by switching on the magnetic stirrer. When the hydrogenation time has elapsed, the magnetic stirrer is switched off and the autoclave is ventilated. A sample for the GC analysis is taken to determine yield and conversion.<br>
Determination of the conversion and of the ee value:<br>
Conversion and ee value are determined on these substrates in one analysis step.<br>

Results<br>
Details of the experiments 1 to 64 with regard to the reactants used, reaction conditions and<br>
the results achieved are listed in the following Table 1:<br>
Table 1 (Part 1)(for Part 2 see next page):<br><br>
(Table Remove)<br>
Experiments 1 and 2: These are carried out under typical transfer hydrogenation conditions. To 10 ml of isopropanol are added: 0.005 mmol of [RuCl2(PPh3)(A)], 1 mmol of the substrate 1 and 0.025 mmol of /PrOK as a base. The reaction is carried out at room temperature under argon in experiment 1 and at a hydrogen pressure of 1.1 bar in experiment 2.<br>
Experiments 3 to 59: The particular catalyst is prepared "in situ" by allowing 0.1 mmol of ligand and 0.1<br>
mmol of [RuCl2 (PPh3)3] in 20 ml of toluene to react for one hour under reflux conditions. 2 ml of the<br>
resulting solution are then added to 2 mmol of the substrate which is in a 20 ml flask. 1 ml of a 1 molar<br>
aqueous solution of NaOH is then added and the flask is placed in a multiparallel autoclave. Hydrogen is<br>
then injected to a pressure of 80 bar for one hour (unless stated otherwise, see table).	<br>
Experiments 60 to 62: A Schlenk flask is charged with 0.005 mmol of [RuCl2(PPh3)(A)], 50 mmol of substrate and 18 ml of toluene in experiment 60, or 250 mmol of substrate and 2 ml of toluene in experiment 61, and 1 ml of a 1 molar aqueous solution of NaOH. The compositions are placed in 50 ml autoclave and subjected to a hydrogen pressure of 80 bar for one hour in experiment 60, and for 78 hours in experiment 61. For reaction 62, the same reaction conditions were used as for 60 except that the reaction was conducted as "neat", namely without addition of toluene.<br>
Experiments 63 to 65: A Schlenk flask is charged with 0.005 mmol of [RuCl2(PPh3)3], 0.005 mmol of ligand and 9 ml of toluene and kept under reflux conditions for one hour. 100 mmol of the substrate and 1 ml of a 1 molar aqueous solution of NaOH are then added at room temperature to the catalyst prepared "in situ". The compositions are placed in a 50 ml autoclave and subjected to a hydrogen pressure of 20 bar for one or one and a half hours (see table).<br>
Discussion of the results<br>
The first two comparative experiments which were carried out under the typical conditions of the transfer hydrogenation show that the application of a hydrogen pressure of 1.1 bar has little influence on the activity but enables higher enantioselectivity. This interesting and important result shows that the hydrogenation with hydrogen enables one of the major disadvantages of the transfer hydrogenation to be avoided, i.e. the decrease in the percentage enantioselectivity with increasing time (which approaches the equilibrium). It was also possible to show that for hydrogenations under elevated pressure of 20 to 80 bar, in the presence of an organic solvent such as toluene instead of isopropanol, turnover numbers of up to 50 000 can be achieved. It is also remarkable that a substrate such as isobutyrophenone (substrate 6) which is known to be difficult to hydrogenate can be hydrogenated under comparable conditions with high enantioselectivity (ee = 97.2%).<br><br><br>
Hydrogenation of imines (substrate 8)<br><br><br>
(Table Remove)<br>
Experiments 66 and 67: The particular catalyst is prepared "in situ" by allowing 0.1 mmol of ligand and 0.1 ml of [RuCI2(PPh3)3] in 20 ml of toluene to react for one hour under reflux conditions. 2 ml of the resulting solution are then added to 2 mmol of the substrate which is in a 20 ml flask. 1 ml of a 1 molar aqueous solution of NaOH is then added and the flask is placed in a multiparallel autoclave. Hydrogen is then injected to a pressure of 80 bar for 16 hours. The results are listed in table 2 above.<br>
Discussion of the results:<br>
It is interesting to note that even with difficult hydrogenation substrates such as imines, the hydrogenation proceeds following analogous conditions to the one described with ketones. Remarkable enantiomeric excesses higher than 90% ee can be achieved.<br><br><br><br><br>
