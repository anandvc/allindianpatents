				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a chewable confectionery composition which reduces the presence of dental plaque from the chewing surfaces of teeth and more particularly the invention relates to a chewable confectionery composition which contains a small but effective amount of a an enzyme effective to disrupt or interfere with plaque formation and adhesion to tooth surfaces.<br>
2.	The Prior Art<br>
Oral compositions such as toothpastes, gels and mouth washes are designed to loosen and remove plaque in conjunction with a regular toothbrusbing regimen. Dental plaque is present to some degree, in the form of a film, on virtually all dental surfaces. It is a product of microbial growth, and comprises a dense microbial layer consisting of a mass of microorganisms embedded in a polysaccharide matrix. Plaque itself adheres firmly to dental surfaces and is removed only with difficulty even through a rigorous brushing regimen. Moreover, plaque rapidly reforms on the tooth surface after it is removed. Plaque may form on any part of the tooth surface, and is found particularly at the gingival margin, in cracks in the enamel, and on the surface of dental calculus. The problem associated with the formation of plaque on the teeth lies in the tendency of plaque to build up and eventually produce gingivitis, periodontitis and other types of periodontal disease, as well as dental caries and dental calculus.<br>
Plaque formation is an ongoing process. Although various oral care products are available to control plaque formation such as toothpastes and mouth rinse, the disadvantage of these products is that only a relatively short time during which the teeth are being brushed or the mouth is being rinsed is available for these preparations to take effect. A further disadvantage of these toothpaste and mouth rinse products is the general infrequency of use, that is, most dental hygiene products are used once or perhaps twice daily and seldom when they are most needed, e. g. , after meals and snacks. Thus food deposits which build up as a result of eating throughout the day are left in the oral cavity for long periods of time thereby promoting microbial growth and formation of plaque on tooth surfaces.<br><br>
It is known to the art to incorporate antimicrobial agents in oral compositions wherein these agents destroy or inhibit oral bacteria responsible for plaque formation Other agents are also incorporated in the oral composition to reduce plaque formation on teeth. For example, it is Im. own to incorporate enzymes such as proteases and carbohydrases in oral compositions, which enzymes disrupt or interfere with plaque formation and bacterial adhesion to tooth surfaces.<br>
Chewable tablets and gums have been used as vehicles for introducing various chemical agents to tooth surfaces including enzymes such as amylase enzymes (US 4,740, 368) oxidoreductases such as glucose oxidase and lactoperoxidase enzymes (US 4,564, 519).<br>
ES-A-2 131006 discloses a chewing gum or a tablet comprising 0.2-5% papain and a non-cariogenic sweetener, the papain enzyme functioning to disrupt or interfere with dental plaque and tartar formation.<br>
GB-A-1 294767 teaches a chewing gum or chewable tablet comprising an enzyme for the prevention and treatment of dental plaque.<br>
In US-A-4,178,362, the use of glucose oxidase enzyme is taught as an effective agent that forms hydrogen peroxide, which loosens and removes plaque from teeth.<br>
JP-A-04 173 056 describes a chewing gum which comprises aspartame and a dextranase or mutanase as anticariogenic component.<br>
US-A-2002/0 006 385 is directed to the use of starch-hydrolysing or starch-modifying enzymes in oral care compositions.<br>
US-A-3,235,460 describes an enzymatically active chewing gum composition comprising pancreatin which catalyses the hydrolysis of the organic matrix, the probable foundation of calculus.<br>
In JP-A-63 104908, a chewable composition is taught which comprises glycoamylase, a non-cariogenic sweetener and an antioxidant.<br>
US-A-5,747,005 teaches an oil-based dentifrice which contains an enzyme selected from the group of proteases, lipases and saccharinoses, together with a high amount of Vitamin E.<br>
In US-A-5,320,830, all kinds of oral compositions are taught which may comprise enzymes and have a pH in the range of 4.0-6.0.<br>
A critical requirement, however, for these compositions is that they are stable and have a long shelf-life, which requirement has limited the use of these compositions because<br><br>
normally, the active agents incorporated in these compositions that provide oral care benefits such as plaque reduction are not stable under ambient conditions of humidity and temperature and as a result the agents quickly become degraded to concentrations of limited efficacy and particularly, enzymes which denature during the manufacturing process.<br>
In view of the inconvenience of using toothpaste and mouth rinse products when away from home, the art is seeking portable products in the form of chewable confections such as tablets and gums which can be used throughout the day, particularly after eating, and which provide antiplaque benefits comparable to those obtained by regular brushing with a toothpaste or use of a mouthrinse.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
In accordance with the present invention, there is provided a chewable confectionery composition such as a chewable tablet or gum comprised of a small but effective amount of a plaque reducing enzyme, a non-cariogenic sweetener and optionally a plasticizing/softening agent.<br>
Particularly, the invention relates to a chewable confectionery composition delivering to both surfaces a unit dose of a plaque reducing enzyme the composition comprising (A) 0.1 to 3 wt.% of an enzyme which functions to disrupt or interfere with plaque formation and adhesion to tooth surfaces, which enzyme is a protease, (B) a solid base material, and (C) the composition further comprising (D) an enzyme stabilising agent that is an agent that by chelating metal impurities protects the enzyme from inactivation or from 0.05 to 1.5 wt.% of a reducing agent stabilizing the enzyme against oxidation; (E) less than 5 wt.% water, wherein the protease is extracted from a natural fruit product and is incorporated into the solid base material of the composition at a temperature of less than 80Â°C.<br>
Due to the inherent nature of the chewable tablet or gum product, prolonged contact with the tooth surfaces is achieved when the product is chewed, forming a paste with saliva containing the enzyme which coats the tooth surfaces. The delivery of the enzyme in a chewable tablet or gum form insures that an adequate dosage of the antiplaque enzyme is deliverable when the product is chewed by the user. The chewable confectionery composition of the present<br><br><br>
invention is portable and can be packaged and stored in a consumers pocket or purse for consumption anytime and anywhere.<br>
When the chewable confectionery composition of the present invention is placed within the mouth and chewed, an effective antiplaque amount of the enzyme is released from the composition into the saliva where it can reach the surface of the teeth to prevent further plaque accumulation. The tablet or gum of the present invention is formed so as to release the enzyme over a period of 0.5 to 2 minutes. Consistent daily use of the chewable tablets or gums of the present invention will then obtain maximum plaque reduction from the teeth of the consumer.<br>
The term "chewable confectionery composition" as used herein includes within its meaning chewing gum, and chewable and orally soluble tablets, troches and lozenges.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
The composition of the present invention as stated is a chewable product which reduces plaque and contains as the active ingredient, a protease enzyme. The product is preferably sugarless.<br>
A representative chewable antiplaque tablet in accordance with the practice of this invention contains about 0.1 to 3% by weight of an enzyme, 0.5 to 5% by weight of a combination plasticizing/softening ingredient and about 50 to about 90% by weight of a non-cariogenic sweetener. In addition to the ingredients discussed above for tablets, chewable gum compositions will contain 10 to 40% by weight of a gum base.<br>
As water promotes the denaturization of the papain enzyme, the presence of water in the chewable confectionery product of the present invention should be at relatively low concentrations in order to impart maximum stability and shelf life to the chewable. For this purpose, it has been found essential to limit the total amount of water present in the chewable product to no more than 5% by weight.<br>
Enzymes<br>
The enzymes useful in the practice of the present invention include carbohydrases such as glucoamylase and enzymes extracted from natural fruit products such as proteases which breakdown or hydrolyze proteins.<br><br>
Protease enzymes useful in the practice of the present invention include those extracted from natural fruit products. The proteolytic enzymes are obtained from natural sources or by the action of microorganisms having a nitrogen source and a carbon source. Examples of proteolytic enzymes useful in the practice of the present invention include the naturally occurring enzymes papain (from papaya), bromelain (from pineapple), as well as serine proteases such as chymotrypsin. Additional enzymes include ficin and alcalase. Papain is a protease enzyme preferred for use in the practice of the present invention, the papain having an activity of 150 to 939 MCU per milligram as determined by the Milk Clot Assay Test of the Biddle Sawyer Group (see J. Biol. Chem. , vol. 121, pages 737-745). The protease enzymes are included in the compositions of the present invention at a concentration of about 0.1 to about 3% by weight and preferably about 0.2 to about 2% by weight.<br>
Enzymes which may beneficially be used in combination with the proteolytic enzymes and glucoamylase enzymes include carbohydrases such as glucoamylase, alpha-amylase, beta- amylase, , tannase and lipases such as plant lipase, gastric lipase and pancreatic lipase.<br>
Glucoamylase is a saccharifying glucoamylase of Aspergillus niger origin cultivated by fermentation. This enzyme can hydrolyze both the alpha-D-1,6 glucosidic branch points and the alpha-1, 4 glucosidic bonds of glucosyl oligosaccharides. Additional carbohydrases useful in accordance with this invention are alpha and beta-amylase, dextranase and mutanase. Glucoamylase is a preferred enzyme and is incorporated in the oral composition of the present invention at a concentration of about 0.001 to 2% by weight and preferably about 0.01 to 0.55% by weight.<br>

The lipase may be included in the dentifrice composition at a concentration of about 0.010 to about 5.0% by weight and preferably about 0.02 to about 0.10 % by weight.<br>
The presence of tannase enzyme can be further beneficial in facilitating the breakdown of extrinsic stain. Tannase enzymes have been purified from Aspergillus niger and Aspergillus allianceus and are useful in the hydrolysis of tannins, known to discolor the tooth surface.<br>
Other suitable enzymes which can comprise the present invention include lysozyme, derived from egg white, which contains a single polypeptide chain crosslinked by four disulfide bonds having a molecular weight of 14,600 daltons. The enzyme can exhibit antibacterial properties<br><br>
by facilitating the hydrolysis of bacterial cell walls cleaving the glycosidic bond between carbon number 1 of N-acetylmuramic acid and carbon number 4 of N-acetyl-D-glucosamine, which in vivo, these two corbohydrates are polymerized to form the cell wall polysaccharide. Additionally, pectinase, an enzyme that is present in most plants facilitates the hydrolysis of the polysaccharide pectin into sugars and galacturonic acid. Finally, glucanase, which may be utilized to catalyze the breakdown of complex carbohydrates to glucans and the hydrolysis of beta glucan to glucose.<br>

Flavoring agents are incorporated in the chewing gum formulation at a concentration of about 0.5 to about 5 % by weight and preferably 1 to 3 % by weight.<br>
Method of Manufacture<br>
The challenge in incorporating enzymes into the confectionary composition is maintaining enzymatic stability and activity during storage. Enzymes are quaternary proteins whose structure, function, and stability are sensitive to chemical environment and processing parameters. Enzymes denature in harsh chemical environment and at high temperatures. Formulation and processing procedures are optimized at low moisture and low temperature for both the enzyme chewable tablet and the enzyme gum to preserve enzymatic activity and in vivo efficacy.<br>
The chewable composition of the present invention is made by any suitable process where the protease enzyme is incorporated into the solid base material such that no water or a limited amount of ingredients that absorb water are used that would result in undesirable amounts of water being introduced into the composition during processing or storage. Further, at the time the enzyme is introduced into ingredients used to prepare the chewable composition that the temperature at the time of addition is less then about 80Â°C. Therefore, it is critical to the practice of the present invention that the composition contain less than 5% by weight water and preferably less than 3% by weight water and that the temperature at which processing of the enzyme occurs be less than about 80Â°C. The presence in the composition of water in amounts greater than 5% by weight or the use of temperatures in excess of 80Â°C will act to denature the protease enzyme thereby substantially reducing the efficacy of the enzyme in effecting plaque reduction on teeth.<br>
One method for manufacturing the composition of the invention comprises first heating the base material to a temperature sufficient to drive off any water in the composition. The base<br><br>
material is then cooled to a temperature at which the enzyme and other temperature sensitive ingredients such as plasticizers, other sweeteners are incorporated and mixed into the base material.<br>
Formulations, equipment and processing techniques have been well developed in the art for preparing and packaging chewing gum and chewable tablets and lozenges. As the enzyme is subject to deterioration and inactivation under conditions such as high shear and elevated temperatures, processing conditions are controlled during the time period that the enzymes are admixed with the other ingredients of the formulation and converted into finished products so that the temperature at the time of admixture does not exceed about 80Â°C for any extended period of time.<br>
The tablets of the confectionary composition of the present invention are conventionally made by grinding the ingredients once mixed and then compressing or molding the ingredients to form a suitable means for the delivery of the enzyme. In order to produce tablets it is necessary to have a free flowing material which has good self binding properties and which will not stick to the molding or compression equipment.<br>
An illustrative procedure for formulating the chewing gum composition is as follows: the gum base is first melted in a heated kettle at 55Â°-65Â°C. One or more of the sweeteners are then added to the gum base followed by one or more flavors, plasticizer. All ingredients are then mixed for a sufficient period of time to ensure adequate dispersion. The mixture is then allowed to cool and the enzyme is added and is cut into suitable serving sizes.<br>
In order to enhance shelf stability, in addition to the admixture used in the preparation of the chewable product being substantially free of water, the finished product should be packaged in a manner so as to minimize exposure to air and moisture.<br>
The following Examples are illustrative of the present invention, but it is understood that the invention is not limited thereto.<br><br>
Example I<br>
Enzyme  (papain)  containing  tablet  and  gum  compositions  were  prepared   using conventional base ingredients as set forth in Tables I and II below.<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
The chewable tablet of Table I was prepared by boiling the Isomalt, Lycasin, water, fat, mono and diglyceride mixture, glycerin, and lecithin to 267-268Â°F (131Â°C) after which glycerin was added and the mixture and cooled to 140Â°F (60Â°C). Thereafter sodium bicarbonate, papain, dicalcium phosphate and the remaining ingredients were added. Thereafter the mixture cooled to room temperature 72-77Â°F (23Â°C) was ground into powder and compressed into a tablet using a tablet press.<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
* Magnesium stearate, .talc, silica gel.<br>
Papain Enzyme Activity<br>
Papain activity was measured and monitored in the papain containing chewable tablets and chewing gums using the Protease Detection kit from Panvera Corp. The activity kit quantifies protease activity using a fluorenscein thiocarbamoyl (FTC)-casein substrate. FTC-casein is attacked by the protease, breaking down casein into TC-peptides. The amount of protease activity is determined by measuring the fluorescence expressed as relative fluorescence units (RFU). The fluorescence signal generated is proportioned to the level of activity of papain in the tablet or gum delivery system. For the purposes of comparison, chewable tablets designated "Tablet A" and chewing gum designated "Chewing Gum B" were prepared in which papain was not included in these compositions. The papain activities of the chewable tablet or Table I and the chewing gum of Table II are recorded in Tables III and IV below as are the papain activities of comparative tablet and gum compositions.<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
The results recorded in Tables III and IV indicate that the enzyme activity in papain when incorporated in a chewable tablet or gum is retained over at least a 4 week period.<br>
In Vivo Plague Reduction Efficacy<br>
The chewable tablet of Table I was tested for plaque reduction at 2-and 5-hours after chewing by human volunteers using plaque grown in vivo in an intra-oral retainer on hydroxyapatite disks. Confocal microscopy was used to visualize and quantify the changes in plaque coverage and plaque ultrastructure. Plaque removal was also measured by conventional light microscopy by staining the plaque before and after treatment with crystal violet indicator and measuring the changes in color intensity. Image Pro Analysis Software was used to perform the image analysis and the quantitative measurements. The color intensity was measured and used to determine stain removal. The greater the intensity, the greater the cleaning efficacy. These results are shown in Table V below.<br>
Confocal images were made of the plaque before treatment (baseline) and 2 and 5 hours after treating with the tablet. Qualitatively, images showed that there is less bacterial coverage 2 and 5 hours after treatment in comparison to baseline. Image analysis was used to quantify these observations. The results recorded in Table V indicated that the total plaque area, measured by pixel counting, was significantly reduced in comparison to baseline and 2 and 5 hours after treatment. Table V also shows that the average cluster area of the plaque bacteria was significantly reduced after treatment demonstrating the significant efficacy in reducing plaque without the aid of mechanical assistance.<br>
In a second study, the plaque before and after staining with crystal violet was viewed by conventional light microscopy. Image analysis was used to determine the white intensity measured in pixels, the higher the pixel number, the whiter the stain. The results from this study are shown in Table VI. The disks stained at baseline were more intensely colored (blue) than the disks stained 2 hours after treatment with the papain containing chewable tablet. The disks were 47.3% whiter than baseline, indicating less staining and therefore, less plaque. Similar results were observed with the papain chewing gum of Table II as shown in Table VII below.<br>
*Inventors: What are these units.<br>
(Table Removed)<br><br><br><br><br>
We claim:<br>
1.	A chewable confectionery composition delivering to tooth surfaces a unit dose of a plaque reducing enzyme the composition comprising (A) 0.1 to 3 wt.% of an enzyme which functions to disrupt or interfere with plaque formation and adhesion to tooth surfaces, which enzyme is a protease, (B) 10 to 40 % by weight of a solid base material, and (C) 25 to 90% by weight of a non-cariogenic sweetener, (D) 0.01 to 1% of an enzyme stabilizing agent that is an agent that by chelating metal impurities protects the enzyme from inactivation or from 0.05 to 1.5 wt.% of a reducing agent stabilizing the enzyme against oxidation; (E) less than 5 wt.% water, wherein the protease is extracted from a natural fruit product and is incorporated into the solid base material of the composition at a temperature of less than 80Â°C.<br>
2.	The chewable confectionery composition as claimed in claim 1 wherein the enzyme is papain.<br>
3.	The chewable confectionery composition as claimed in claim 1 wherein the composition is in the form of a tablet.<br>
4.	The chewable confectionery composition as claimed in claim 1 wherein the composition is a chewing gum.<br>
5.	The chewable confectionery composition as claimed in claim 1 wherein the noncariogenic, sweetener is a sugar alcohol.<br>
6.	The chewable confectionery composition as claimed in claim 1 wherein the non-cariogenic sweetener is an artificial sweetener.<br><br>
7.	The chewable confectionery composition as claimed in claim 1 wherein the noncariogenic sweetener is a sugar alcohol of a disaccharide.<br>
8.	The chewable confectionery composition as claimed in claim 1 wherein the noncariogenic sweetener is present in the composition at a concentration of 40 to 85% by weight.<br>
9.	The chewable confectionery composition as claimed in claim 1 wherein the enzyme stabilizing agent that by chelating metal impurities protects the enzyme from inactivation is an agent selected from EDTA and sodium gluconate.<br>
10.	The chewable confectionery composition as claimed in claim 1 wherein the agent stabilizing the enzyme is selected from reducing agents.<br>
11.	The chewable confectionery composition as claimed in claim 1 wherein the composition further comprises an enzyme selected from carbohydrases.</td>
