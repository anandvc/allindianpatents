The field of Technology pertaining to this invention can be broadly classified and Generally Indicated as relating to eco - friendly Technology concerning generally disposal of waste. More particularly this invention relates to and concerned with a Mobile-Toilet system for human waste disposal in general and in particular relating to human waste disposal in Trains, Buses, Trucks and Other Mobile Vehicles. The toilet is a portable unit.<br>
Conventional type of waste disposal comprises provisions wherein toilet is connected to a Septictank and the waste is disposed off. The disadvantages relating to conventional type of system are as follows:<br>
1.	Septic System would not work in a rainy seasons due to flooding in the Septic tank,<br>
2.	Usage of disinfectents in the toilet reduces the microbial action in the septic tank and there by digestion of human waste is reduced and which results in producing a bad odour and creates environmental problem in the surroundings.<br>
3.	Septic system is a stationery one and as such it cannot be moved from one place to another place.<br>
4.	The septic system is rendered useless if ground water level is high ie in Island and in places near to river bank<br>
Further problem is associated with disposal of human waste in railway coaches, if the human waste has not been flushed out properly. The human waste gets stuck in to the under chases of the coaches.<br>
It is therefore essential to find out an appropriate method of disposal of human waste in a mobile or transport system.<br>
Our invention addressed to the problem associated with disposal of solid inorganic waste material in general and especially disposal of human waste material in a mobile system.<br>
Accordingly our invention relates to a novel contrivance which enable safe and eco-friendly method of disposal of solid organic waste material.   To this end we have<br><br>
constructed a novel mobile toilet system for disposal of solid organic waste material and especially disposal of human waste.<br>
Accordingly it is the primary object of the invention to invent a mobile toilet system for disposal of human waste material.<br>
It is another object of the invention to invent a mobile toilet system for disposal of human waste material wherein the human solid waste is completely treated and the treated effluent is safely let out.<br>
It is another object of the invention to invent a mobile toilet system for disposal of human waste material wherein the said invention adaptable to be used in railways by which the railway track is kept in a clean condition.<br>
It is another object of the invention to invent a mobile toilet system for disposal of human v/aste material wherein the said device is adopted to be used in places wherein the ground water level in very high and other type of toilet system will pollute the atmosphere.<br>
It is another object of the invention to invent a mobile toilet system for disposal of human waste material which can be advantageously used in various transport system namely railways trucks, automobiles, fishing boats and related mobile systems.<br>
Further object of the invention will be apparant from the ensuing description.<br>
Mobile toilet system for disposal of human waste comprising a primary digestion tank, a secondary digestion tank and a disinfection tank, the said tanks being fixed one above the other and inter connected such that the effluent treated from one tank flows into another tank by over flow technique, a separate holding tank being provided outside the secondary digestion tank to hold disinfectant liquid ,the said disinfectant liquid being fed when the effluent flows from secondary digestion tank to disinfection tank, an opening with removeable lid being provided in the front side of the primary tank to collect the inorganic based settled in the primary digestion tank, a control valve being provided to drain the effluent from the primary digestion tank at the time of removing the inorganic waste, the said arrangement effectively treat the effluent and the disinfected material being let out on the ground without any solid waste and smell and a set of electrical laminations outside and around the set tank to keep the effluent between 35°C to 40°C.<br><br>
Now the invention will be described in detail with reference to drawings wherein Figure 1 shows in elevation the entire system for disposal of solid organic waste material. Figure 2 shows in plan view of top lid<br>
Figure 3 shows top view of primary digestion tank.<br>
Figure 4 shows in cross section elevation the primary digestion tank.<br>
Figure 5 shows the bottom view of primary digestion tank.<br>
Figure 6 shows the top view of secondary digestion tank.<br>
Figure 7 shows the top sectional elevation of secondary digestion tank.<br>
Figure 8 shows the bottom view of secondary digestion tank.<br>
Figure 9 shows the top view of disinfecting tank and<br>
Figure 10 shows the cross sectional elevation of disinfecting tank.<br>
The system for disposal of solid wastecomprises primarily three components namely primary digestion tank (No.2) a secondary digestion tank (No.3) and a disinfecting tank (No.5)<br>
The above tanks as shown in fig.l of the drawing are fixed one above other and interconnected. The effluent is treated in the first tank (2) and goes to the second tank (3)by over flow technique. The same over flow technique is used from secondary digesition tank (3) to disinfection tank (5). A separate holding tank (No.7) is provided out side of the secondary digestion tank to hold the disinfectant liquid. The primary digestion tank of the secondary digestion tank (3). The primary digestion tank (2) is closed with a lid (1) and it has a hole at the center. The hole is provided for inlet of waste. An opening with removable lid (No.6) is provided in the front side of the primary digestion tank to<br><br>
collect the inorganic solids collected in the tank. A control valve (8) is provided to dram the effluent from the primary digestion tank at the time of removing the inorganic waste.<br>
Plug valve system (8) is meant to drain effluent to the secondary digestion tank to avoid spilling of water through the opening at the time of removing inorganic waste.<br>
Fig.2 shows the top view of the lid with a hole (4) at the centre of the lid.<br>
The primary digestion tank (2) is the waste collection tank where the primary digestion takes place. The tank is segmented with plates (11 &amp; 12) as shown in the Fig No.3 (9,10) to hold the water level up to 2/3 of the tank. The excess of the effluent is allowed to over flow in to the secondary digestion tank (3). The human waste is disintegrated in the water and digested by the pre-inoculated microorganism. The effluent passes through the filter media (13) and the clear effluent go to the secondary digestion tank by over flow technique. An opening (6) with a removable lid and with a valve arrangement (8) is provided to remove the inorganic waste. The said control valve (8) is provided to drain the effluent to the second tank through hole (14), at the time of clearing the inorganic waste from the tank. A filter media (13) is provided to filter the effluent. The filter media is also used for incubating eco friendly bacterias.<br>
The effluent is initially treated in the primary digestion tank and subsiquently in the secondary digestion tank. The secondary digestion tank is also segmeted with plates (15 &amp; 16) to hold the effluent. Then the effluent go the disinfecting tank by over flow technique.<br>
The plates (15 &amp; 16) are tomaintain the effluent level in the secondary digestion tank. A filter media (17) is provided to filter the effluent. The media is also used for bacterial growth. A disinfectant holding tank (7) is welded on the out side of the secondary digestion tank to hold the disinfectant (16).<br>
Disinfection holding tank is connected to disinfection tank by control mechanism (17 &amp; 18) this disinfectant in controled dosage is allowed in the disfection tank. A sequare frame (20) is welded at the bottom of the secondary digestion tank to control the effluent in the digestion tank.<br><br>
Finally, the effluent is coming to the disinfection tank by over flow technique from the secondary digestion tank. A square pipe (21) is welded in the center of the disinfection tank and it goes in the sqare frame welded at the bottom of the secondary digestion tank. By this arrangement the effluent completely detained for sufficient time and disinfected and finally let out.<br>
One of the salient features of the invention as shown in figure 4 in respect of primary digestion tank is that the water flows through the medium (4) and by overflow technique to the second tank. By virtue of the movement of water taking a considerable tank from the first tank to second tank the primary digestion taking place effectively in the said tank.<br>
The main constructional difference between the primary digestion tank and the secondary digestion tank is that the plates in the secondry digestion tank are perpendicular to the position envisaged in the primary digestion tank. This results in proper and complete digestion of waste in the second tank namely secondary digestion tank.<br>
As shown in figure 10 the disinfectant tank receive effluent from the second digestion tank. The effluent flows to the outlet by overflow technique . This results in the effluent being properly treated with help of disinfectant supplied from tank (7) An appropriate quantity of disinfectant material is supplied continuously by control mechanism (17 &amp; 18).<br>
Another salient feature of the invention is in the provision of employing electrical lamination outside the three tanks to keep the effluent between 35-40' . This provision includes heating coil (9), insulated by conventional insulating material (10).<br>
The electrical lamination is energized from a power supply 230 volts AC or 110 volts DC as the case may be.  By this mechanism the toilet can be used even in sub zero levels.<br>
Advantages of the invention:<br>
(1)	The human solid waste is completely treated and the treated effluent is let out,<br>
(2)	The railway track is kept in a clean condition to prevent any infection.<br>
(3)	In the place where the water level is high, this type of toilet can be used to avoid pollution.<br><br>
(4)	The equipment is very effective mobile <br>
(5)	The equipment can be advantageously used in varies types of transport equipment such us trains, buses, trams and trucks, fish boats and other related equipments.<br>
(6)	The device can be used in sub zero level where the normal septic system will not function.<br>
