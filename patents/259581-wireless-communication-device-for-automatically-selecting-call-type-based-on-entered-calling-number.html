				<td>WIRELESS COMMUNICATION DEVICE WITH CALL MANAGEMENT CAPABILITY AND METHOD THEREFOR<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
This invention relates in general to wireless communication devices and more particularly to wireless communication devices having video and voice communication capability.<br>
Description of the Related Art<br>
Historically, wireless communication devices, such as cellular telephones and two way messaging devices, have had the ability to receive data and/or voice messages sent from a wireless communication system, and perform standard functions in response to message receipt such as storing the message, displaying the message, or alerting the user of receipt of the message. Data messages are typically a numeric message such as a phone number, or an alphanumeric message containing one unique piece of information such as "meeting in my office at 6:00pm."<br>
The user is alerted of receipt of a new message by an audible alert or a vibratory alert. The display of many wireless communication devices today includes a message indicator for each message it has received and stored in memory. This message indicator allows a quick view for the user of how many messages are in the wireless communication device and also allows the user to quickly pick a message to<br><br>
view.    The display further can include a call receipt message indicating to the user a new call is being received and/or the source of the new call.<br>
Today, methods and systems have been developed in an attempt to satisfy the increasing demand for information, multimedia and other communication services on wireless communication devices.   In particular, state of the art wireless communication technology today offers increased capacity and high-speed data applications up to 2 megabits.   Recently wireless communication technologies have been implemented which integrate pico-micro and rnacrocellular technology and allows global roaming of wireless communication device. Further, wireless communication systems today are being designed for simultaneous transfer of speech, data, text, pictures, audio and video. For example, 3G (Third generation) wireless communication devices can provide a device user the capability to send images or to participate in live video conferencing. 3G networks can deliver the kind of highspeed wireless that supports video applications for utilization in MMS (multimedia messaging service).   Adding a camera attachment to the wireless communication device facilitates the capability of the device to capture video. The captured video can then be wirelessly transmitted as a message via the wireless communication networks.<br>
Some wireless communication devices today have the capability to make both voice and video calls. Typically, both types of calls are made from the same user interface (such as a keypad) with the user manually switching a call mode setting between voice and video calls.   One drawback to this method is the reliance on the device user to manually switch the call mode setting. For example, during an emergency, the device user may not have the time to reset the call mode from video to<br><br>
voice. Alternatively, the device user may forget to set the call mode to voice and miss incoming voice calls.<br>

FIG. 1 is an electronic block diagram of a wireless communication system according to the present invention. As illustrated in FIG. 1, a wireless communication system 100 according to the present invention includes a wireless communication device 102, such as a wireless telephone device, capable of either second generation<br><br>
Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) data interchange or third generation Universal Mobile Telephone System (UMTS) data interchange, or both. For example, the wireless communication device 102 transmits circuit-switched data through an air interface 106 to, and receives circuit-switched data through the air interface 106 from a second generation GSM General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) and Enhanced Data for Global Evolution (EDGE), GSM GPRS/EDGE radio access network 104. The circuit-switched data is transmitted by radio access network 104 from the wireless communication device 102 to a public switched telephone network (PSTN) 108, and from the public switched telephone network 108 to the wireless communication device 102, through a mobile switching center 110.<br>
The wireless communication device 102 transmits packet-switched data through the air interface 106 to, and receives packet-switched data through the air interface 106 from the radio access network 104. The packet-switched data received from the wireless communication device 102 is transmitted by the radio access network 104 to a serving GPRS support node (SGSN) 112, which then transmits the packet-switched data to a gateway GPRS support node (GGSN) 114. The gateway GPRS support node 114 converts the packet-switched data from a domain associated with the radio access network 104 to a domain associated with a packet data network 116 and transmits the converted packet-switched data to packet data network 116.<br>
Similarly, packet-switched data received from the packet data network 116 is converted by the gateway GPRS support node 114 from the domain associated with the packet data network 116 to the domain associated with the radio access network 104. The converted packet-switched data is then transmitted from the gateway GPRS<br><br>
support node 114 to the radio access network 104 through the GPRS support node 112. The radio access network 104 then transmits the packet-switched data to the wireless communication device 102 along the air interface 106.<br>
The radio access network 104 preferably includes a protocol control unit 118, a base station controller 120, and a base transceiver station. The protocol control unit 118 interfaces between serving the GPRS support node 112 and the base station controller 120, which controls the packet-switched data that is transmitted between the packet data network 116 and the wireless communication device 102. The base station controller 120 controls one or more base transceiver stations, including the base transceiver station 122 located within the radio access network 104. The base transceiver station 122 includes a transmitter 124 and a receiver 126 for transmitting and receiving data between the wireless communication device 102 and the radio access network 104 along the air interface 106. The base station controller 120 transmits packet-switched data received from the packet data network 116 via the protocol control unit 118 to the base transceiver station 122, which then transmits the packet-switched data to the wireless communication device 102 along the air interface 106. In the same way, the base station controller 120 transmits packet-switched data received from the wireless communications device 102 via the base transceiver station 122 to the protocol control unit 118. The packet-switched data is then transmitted from the protocol control unit 118 to the packet data network 116 through the serving GPRS support node 112 and the gateway GPRS support node 114.<br>
In addition to receiving packet-switched data exchanged between the packet data network 116 and the wireless communication device 102, the base station<br><br>
controller 118 receives circuit-switched data transmitted from the public switched telephone network 108 to the wireless communication device 102 through the mobile switching center 110, and transmits the circuit-switched data to the base transceiver station 122. The circuit-switched data is then transmitted from the base transceiver station 122 to the wireless communication device 102 along the air interface 106.<br>
The base transceiver station 122 transmits circuit-switched data received from the wireless communication device 102 for transmission to the public switched telephone network 108 to the base station controller 120, and the circuit-switched data is then transmitted from the base station controller 120 to the mobile switching center 110, which then transmits the circuit-switched data to the public switch telephone network 108.<br>
In this way, according to one embodiment of the present invention, wireless communication system 100 includes the wireless communication device 102, the radio access network 104 and the mobile switching center 110, with the wireless communication device 102 being capable of transmitting and receiving circuit-switched data along a circuit-switched data path between the wireless communication device 102 and the public switched telephone network 108 through the mobile switching center 110, the radio access network 104 and the air interface 106.<br>

switched telephone network 108 through the mobile switching center 110 is transmitted by the third generation UMTS radio access network 128 to the wireless communication device 102.   The wireless communication device 102 transmits packet-switched data through the air interface 106 to, and receives packet-switched data through the air interface 106 from the third generation UMTS radio access network 128. The packet-switched data received by the third generation UMTS radio access network 128 from the wireless communication device 102 is transmitted by the third generation UMTS radio access network 128 to the serving GPRS support node 112, which then transmits to the packet-switched data to the gateway GPRS support node (GGSN) 114.

The user interface 265 can be one or more buttons used to generate a button press, a series of button presses, a voice response from the device user, or some other similar method of manual response initiated by the device user of the wireless communication device<br><br>
102. The processor 240, in response to receiving a user input 275 via the user interface 265, such as a device user depressing a button or series of buttons, or in response to receipt of a message, initiates a user input signal to the call manager application 270. The call manager application 270, in response to the user input signal including a calling number, accesses a plurality of call number information stored in the categorized number memory 295 for use in operation of the call manager application 270.   For example, when the device user enters the calling number "911" and presses SEND using the user interface 265, the call manager application 270 accesses the categorized number memory 295 in either or both the memory 245 and/or the memory storage device 205. When the number "911" is stored as an emergency phone number with a voice call type associated with it, the call manager application 270 sends an application signal to the processor 240 notifying the processor 240 that the call type for this call is a voice call.<br>
The device transmitter 230 is coupled to the processor 240 and is responsive to one or more commands from the processor 240. When the device transmitter 230 receives a command from the processor 240, the device transmitter 230 sends a signal from the second antenna 220 to the air interface 106 for communication within the wireless communication system 100. For example, the device transmitter 230 initiates a voice call via the air interface 106 when the number "911" is identified as described above.<br>
In an alternative embodiment (not shown), the wireless communication device 102 includes one antenna performing the functionality of the first antenna 215 and the second antenna 220. Further, the wireless communication device 102 alternatively<br><br>
includes a transceiver circuit (not shown) performing the functionality of the device receiver 225 and the device transmitter 230. It will be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art that other similar electronic block diagrams of the same or alternate type can be utilized for the wireless communication device 102.<br>
In an alternate embodiment of the present invention, the call manager application 270 is programmed to include one or more call type parameters 300 for identification of the call type to utilize with a telephone number entered using the user interface 265. Each call type parameter can be a calculation, an equation, a function, or a comparison value. The one or more call type parameters can be changed in response to receipt of a programming message, in response to a timer timeout, or in response to a direct reprogramming of the call manager application 270. As an example, the call type parameter can be a particular button press or series of button presses by the device user using the user interface 265. The user interface 265 can include an emergency red button and when the telephone number entered is followed by the pressing of the emergency button, the call manager application 270 processes the call using a voice call type.<br>
It will be appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art that the wireless communication device 102 includes a current operation mode 305 preferably stored in the memory 245. The current operation mode 305 identifies the call type in use by the wireless communication device 102 for communicating within the wireless communication system 100. The call manager application 270 informs the processor 240 to utilize the call type of the current operation mode 305 when the number inputted to the user interface 265 is not included in the categorized number memory<br><br>
295.   In accordance with the present invention, when the number inputted to the user interface 265 is included in the categorized number memory 295, the call type associated with that stored number overrides the current operation mode 305. For example, when the current operation mode 305 is set to a voice call mode, when the user enters the emergency number "911" and presses SEND on the user interface 265, and this number is stored within the categorized number memory 295 with an associated voice call type, the wireless communication device 102 will make a voice call. Similarly, when the current operation mode 305 is set to a video call mode, and this number is stored within the categorized number memory 295 with an associated voice call type, when the user enters the emergency number "911" and presses SEND on the user interface 265, the wireless communication device 102 will change the operation mode to a voice call mode and send a voice call.   When "911" is not stored within the categorized number memory 295 with an associated voice call type, the wireless communication device 102 utilizes the current operation mode 305, which would initiate a video call in this last example.<br>
FIG. 4 is a flowchart illustrating one embodiment of the operation of the wireless communication device 102 in accordance with the present invention.   The operation begins with the wireless communication device 102 in standby operation. Next, at Step 400, the process queries for receipt of the user input 275 to the user interface 265. The user input 275, for example, can be the pressing of a series of buttons to form a desired telephone number to be dialed on the wireless communication device 102. When no user input is detected, the process cycles back and periodically checks for the user input 275. In Step 405, when the user input 275<br><br>
is detected in Step 400, the process next compares the number associated with the user input 275 to the plurality of numbers 210 stored in the categorized number memory 295.   Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the number can be stored in the memory 245, the memory storage device 205, or any combination. In Step 410, when the number associated with the user input 275 is not stored within the plurality of numbers 210, the current operation mode is maintained. Next, in Step 440, the wireless communication device 102 initiates a call using the current operation mode 305. In Step 415, when in Step 405 it is determined that the number associated with the user input 275 is stored in within the plurality of numbers 210, the process compares the associated call type stored with the number with the current operation mode 305. When the associated call type is the same as the current operation mode 305, the process continues to Step 410. In Step 420, when the associated call type is not the same as the current operation mode 410, the operation mode is changed to the associated call type. Next, in Step 440, the wireless communication device 102 initiates a call using the new operation mode.<br>
FIG. 5 is a flowchart illustrating one embodiment of the operation of the wireless communication device 102 in accordance with the present invention. The operation begins with the wireless communication device 102 in standby operation. Next, at Step 400, the process queries for receipt of the user input 275 to the user interface 265. The user input 275, for example, can be the pressing of a series of buttons to form a desired telephone number to be dialed on the wireless communication device 102. When no user input is detected, the process cycles back and periodically checks for the user input 275. In Step 425, when the user input 275<br><br>
is detected, the process determines whether or not the user input 275 includes one or more call type parameters 300. When no call type parameter is included within the user input 275, the process continues at Step 410. In Step 410, the current operation mode is maintained. Next, in Step 440, the wireless communication device 102 initiates a call using the current operation mode 305. When one or more call type parameters 300 are associated with the user input 275, the process continues at Step 430 wherein the one or more call type parameters 300 are utilized to perform one or more operations on the current operation mode 305. Next, in Step 435, the operation mode is changed to the associated call type according to the operations performed in Step 430. Next, in Step 440, the wireless communication device 102 initiates a call using the new operation mode.<br>
