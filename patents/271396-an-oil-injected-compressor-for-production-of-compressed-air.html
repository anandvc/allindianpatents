Description<br>
Oil-injected compressor with a temperature switch<br>
The present invention relates to an oil-injected<br>
compressor, in particular an oil-injected screw-type<br>
compressor with a motor-powered compressor unit for<br>
production of compressed air, which interacts with an<br>
oil circuit for lubrication, which is followed by an<br>
oil separator device for separation of the oil from the<br>
compressed air, with a self-resetting temperature<br>
switch for switching off the compressor unit when the<br>
air/oil mixture flowing in reaches a maximum<br>
temperature limit being provided in the area of the<br>
inlet of the compressed air containing oil into the oil<br>
separator device.<br>
In addition to oil-injected screw-type compressors, the<br>
present invention is also used for other types of oil-<br>
injected compressors, for example, vane-cell<br>
compressors as well. In the case of compressors of the<br>
type that is of interest here, oil is injected by means<br>
of an oil circuit into the area of the moving<br>
compressor components, and on their bearing points, in<br>
order on the one hand to lubricate the roller bearings<br>
which are provided in this case and rotate at high<br>
speed, and in order on the other hand to prevent<br>
unacceptable heating in the area of the moving<br>
compressor components, as a result of friction.<br>
Furthermore, the oil is also used to seal the air side<br>
from other areas of the compressor. The use of oil-<br>
injected compressors such as these extends not only to<br>
stationary compressed-air supply installations, but<br>
also to mobile applications such as rail vehicle<br>
construction, or else to commercial vehicle<br>
construction where compressors are used to produce<br>
compressed air for the vehicle compressed-air supply<br>
system.<br><br>
WO 2006/094781	PCT/EP2006/002121<br>
- 2 -<br>
Oil-injected compressors, such as oil-injected screw-<br>
type compressors, are known from the general prior art.<br>
An oil-injected screw-type compressor essentially<br>
comprises a compressor unit with at least one pair of<br>
compressor screws in the form of rollers, rotating in<br>
opposite directions to one another, and intermeshing<br>
with one another. This compressor screw arrangement is<br>
used to produce compressed air, in that air that is<br>
sucked in from the atmosphere from one side is<br>
converted by continuous compression to compressed air,<br>
which leaves the compressor unit via a spring-reset<br>
outlet valve. In this case, the compressor screw<br>
arrangement is driven via a drive shaft which is passed<br>
to the outside out of the compressor unit via a seal,<br>
by means of a motor which is flange-connected to it<br>
here, generally an electric motor. In order to<br>
lubricate, seal and cool the compressor unit, it is<br>
equipped with an oil circuit which, starting from an<br>
oil sump, supplies oil to the central area of the<br>
compressor screw arrangement as well as to roller<br>
bearings which are arranged in the area of the end face<br>
of the compressor screw arrangement. The oil which is<br>
injected here leaves this active area in the direction<br>
of an oil sump, which represents the reservoir for the<br>
oil circuit. The oil sump is generally located within<br>
an oil separator device which follows the oil circuit.<br>
The oil separator device is necessary in order to<br>
remove the oil from the compressed air again, so that<br>
compressed air which is free of oil is available on the<br>
output side. Conventionally, the oil separator device<br>
is formed essentially from an oil separator which<br>
operates in a manner known per se, on the force of<br>
gravity principle. The oil which is separated from the<br>
compressed air which contains oil and rises in the oil<br>
separator is gathered in the oil sump. The compressed<br>
air which is already partially free of oil and rises in<br>
the oil separator is then generally supplied to a<br><br>
WO 2006/094781	PCT/EP2006/002121<br>
- 3 -<br>
cartridge-like fine separator and then leaves the oil<br>
separator device via a pressure-maintenance valve<br>
arranged on the output side.<br>
According to EN Standard 1012-1, it is not permissible<br>
for safe operation of an oil-injected compressor such<br>
as this for the oil temperature to exceed 120°C<br>
adjacent to the area in which the compressed air<br>
containing oil enters the oil separator device. A<br>
temperature switch is normally arranged in said area in<br>
order to comply with this Standard. The temperature<br>
switch switches on on reaching a temperature of 120°C<br>
and. stops the drive for the compressor unit, by<br>
switching off the motor. When the temperature falls<br>
into the range below 12 0°C again, the drive for the<br>
compressor unit is enabled again.<br>
US 5,118,2 60 discloses a temperature switch such as<br>
this for a screw-type compressor although, in this<br>
case, this is not in the form of an oil-injected screw-<br>
type compressor. The temperature switch is arranged at<br>
the outlet of the screw-type compressor within an<br>
outlet chamber. The compressed air which has been<br>
heated by the screw-type compressor flows past this.<br>
The temperature switch contains an electrical<br>
bimetallic element which interrupts the drive to the<br>
screw-type compressor when the temperature of the<br>
compressed air that has been produced reaches a<br>
specific maximum value. In addition to this temperature<br>
switch, which is arranged in the area of the compressed<br>
air flowing out of the compressor unit, a further<br>
temperature switch is located in the area of the<br>
electric motor that drives the screw-type compressor,<br>
and protects the entire unit against motor overheating.<br>
If a motor-powered compressor unit such as this is<br>
provided with oil injection, so that it is necessary to<br>
provide a downstream oil separator device in order to<br><br>
WO 2006/094781	PCT/EP2006/002121<br>
- 4 -<br>
separate the oil from the compressed air, this results<br>
in the problem that internal fires or detonations can<br>
occur sporadically, despite the measure explained above<br>
to prevent overheating within the oil separator device.<br>
A singular event such as this normally occurs<br>
downstream from the temperature switch, as required in<br>
accordance with the Standard cited initially, within<br>
the oil separator device. So far, the reason for such<br>
an internal fire or detonation has not clearly been<br>
explained. In specialist circles it is assumed that<br>
this event is the consequence of electrostatic<br>
discharges within the oil separator device, producing<br>
electrical sparks. Lack of servicing and, in<br>
particular, lack of oil can also be considered as<br>
detonation causes. A fire or a detonation results in<br>
temperatures in the oil separator device and downstream<br>
from it which are many times higher than the specified<br>
temperature limit of 120°C. Since the temperature on<br>
the inlet side of the oil separator device, in<br>
particular because of the physical proximity of the oil<br>
sump, is matched only slowly to the hot temperature<br>
level, the required temperature switch in the area of<br>
the compressed air flowing in cannot react sufficiently<br>
quickly to the event of a fire or detonation within the<br>
oil separator device, or downstream from it. A fire or<br>
detonation can result in the components of the oil<br>
separator device, which are occasionally also produced<br>
from aluminum, burning through, while, furthermore, the<br>
bearing for the compressor screws can seize as a<br>
consequence of overheating or lack of lubrication, and<br>
in the case of the gray-iron and cast-steel housings<br>
normally used, this can even lead to explosive<br>
destruction of the compressor. Furthermore, combustion<br>
residues also enter the exhaust air. In summary, this<br>
singular event can result in hazards to personnel and<br>
damage to the compressor as well as consequential<br>
damage, which therefore cannot be prevented, or at<br>
least limited by the temperature switch required by the<br><br><br>
WO 2006/094781	PCT/EP2006/002121<br>
- 5 -<br>
Standard.<br>
The object of the present invention is therefore to<br>
improve further an oil-injected compressor of the type<br>
mentioned initially so as to make it possible to cope<br>
with the negative effects of a fire or detonation<br>
within the oil separator device.<br>
On the basis of an oil-injected compressor according to<br>
the preamble of claim 1, the object is achieved in<br>
conjunction with the characterizing features of this<br>
claim. The subsequent, dependent claims specify<br>
advantageous developments of the invention.<br>
The invention includes the technical teaching that at<br>
least one non-self-resetting additional temperature<br>
switch is provided in the internal area of the oil<br>
separator device downstream from an oil-injected<br>
compressor, and switches the compressor unit off<br>
without delay in response to a fire or a detonation of<br>
the compressed air which is contained in the oil<br>
separator device and contains oil. For the purposes of<br>
the present invention, the expression internal area of<br>
the oil separator device should be understood as<br>
meaning the large-volume internal area which contains<br>
the oil/air mixture and, in particular, also the outlet<br>
area of the compressed air, from which oil has been<br>
separated, from the oil separator device as far as, at<br>
most, the inlet to a recooler which may be connected<br>
downstream in the outlet flow direction.<br>
The particular advantage of the solution according to<br>
the invention is that the specific positioning of the<br>
additional temperature switch ensures that the<br>
compressor is rendered inoperative without delay in the<br>
event of an internal fire or detonation. Specifically,<br>
in the case of compressed-air compressors, this<br>
suppresses the oxygen supply, immediately quenching the<br><br>
WO 2006/094781	PCT/EP2006/002121<br>
- 6 -<br>
fire and avoiding consequential damage. Pressure relief<br>
is also normally initiated, assisted by the shut down<br>
process. In summary, the process of shutting down the<br>
compressor immediately, initiated according to the<br>
invention, extracts oxygen very quickly from the<br>
internal combustion process, quenching the fire. The<br>
additional temperature switch therefore renders the<br>
compressor inoperative quickly and permanently in the<br>
event of this event. This effectively prevents<br>
personnel injuries or total damage to the oil-injected<br>
compressor, as well as consequential damage. Since at<br>
least some of the components of the compressor will<br>
have already been damaged in this event, the compressor<br>
is rendered inoperative by the non-self-resetting<br>
additional temperature switch according to the<br>
invention until suitable maintenance personnel have<br>
carried out a repair and operation of the oil-injected<br>
compressor can resume after a new temperature switch<br>
has been fitted.<br>
The additional temperature switch should preferably be<br>
in the form of a fuse link, in order to ensure that the<br>
compressor is reliably reconnected only after said<br>
specialist repair. This is because a fuse link<br>
permanently interrupts the circuit bridged by the<br>
additional temperature switch and is reliably destroyed<br>
after initiation, thus precluding accidental<br>
reconnection of the compressor unit. Furthermore,<br>
temperature switches in the form of fuse links are<br>
quite simple components which can be obtained as mass-<br>
produced items. They also include particularly quick-<br>
reaction fuse links which are particularly suitable for<br>
the application according to the subject matter of the<br>
invention.<br>
In order to ensure that the additional temperature<br>
switch according to the invention is reliably initiated<br>
if the event occurs, it is preferably arranged in the<br><br>
WO 2006/094781	PCT/EP2006/002121<br>
- 7 -<br>
outlet area of the internal area, as defined above, of<br>
the oil separator device, in which the flow speed of<br>
the compressed air flowing out of it is normally high.<br>
A particularly rapid temperature rise can therefore be<br>
observed in this area in the event of a fire or<br>
detonation, and can then be reliably detected by the<br>
additional temperature switch. One particularly<br>
suitable location for arrangement of the additional<br>
temperature switch is in the area between a pressure-<br>
maintenance valve, which is normally arranged on the<br>
outlet side of the oil separator device, and an<br>
upstream fine separator unit. It is also optimal to<br>
arrange the additional temperature switch, on the<br>
outlet side, in the compressed air flow in the area<br>
immediately following said pressure-maintenance valve.<br>
In a further measure which represents an improvement to<br>
the invention, extinguishants are additionally forced<br>
into the internal area of the oil separator device when<br>
the additional temperature switch trips, thus resulting<br>
in the oil-injected compressor being shut down by<br>
switching off the drive. Generally known fire-retardant<br>
substances, which extract oxygen by an appropriate<br>
chemical reaction from their surrounding area when<br>
heated, are suitable for use as extinguishants. These<br>
substances may be in the form of powder, foam and the<br>
like.<br>
According to another measure that represents an<br>
improvement to the invention, optical indication means<br>
can be provided, which signal the tripping of the<br>
additional temperature switch when the event occurs.<br>
The advantage of this measure is that the rare<br>
occurrence of a fire or a detonation within the oil<br>
separator device can be diagnosed without doubt by the<br>
maintenance personnel, thus allowing specific repair.<br>
The present invention is not intended solely for a<br><br>
WO 2006/094781	PCT/EP2006/002121<br>
- 8 -<br>
single-stage, oil-injected compressor. It is<br>
accordingly possible for the compressor also to be in<br>
the form of a multistage compressor unit with each<br>
stage being followed by an oil separator device, in<br>
which case additional temperature switches according to<br>
the invention must then be provided adjacent to the oil<br>
separator device for each compressor stage.<br>
Further measures that represent improvements to the<br>
invention will be described in more detail in the<br>
following text, together with the description of one<br>
preferred exemplary embodiment of the invention, and<br>
with reference to the figures, in which:<br>
Figure 1 shows a longitudinal section through an oil-<br>
injected compressor with a downstream oil<br>
separator device, and<br>
Figure 2 shows a longitudinal section through an<br>
additional temperature switch for the oil<br>
separator device.<br>
As shown in Figure 1 an oil-injected screw-type<br>
compressor essentially comprises a compressor unit 1<br>
which is driven by a motor 2. A compressor screw<br>
arrangement 3 which is mounted within the compressor<br>
unit by means of roller-bearing arrangements such that<br>
it can rotate, compresses air which is sucked in from<br>
the surrounding area by the rotary movement produced by<br>
the motor 2 and this air is supplied via an inlet<br>
channel 4. Oil for lubrication is injected from an oil<br>
circuit 5 in the axial central area of the compressor<br>
screw arrangement 3. Some of the oil which is required<br>
in this case for lubrication, cooling and sealing<br>
purposes is in this case introduced into the compressed<br>
air leaving the outlet side of the compressor screw<br>
arrangement 3. An oil separator device 6 follows the<br>
compressor unit 1, in order to separate the oil from<br><br>
WO 2006/094781	PCT/EP2006/002121<br>
- 9 -<br>
the compressed air.<br>
The oil separator device 6 has an oil sump 7, in the<br>
area of which the compressed air which contains.oil and<br>
is produced by the compressor unit 1 flows into the oil<br>
separator device 6. This flow is passed firstly into<br>
the area of an initial oil separator 8. The initial oil<br>
separator 8 separates oil by the force resulting from<br>
the effect of gravity. The oil separated in this way<br>
enters the oil sump 7. After passing through the<br>
initial oil separator 8, the compressed air, from which<br>
some of the oil has already been removed, enters a fine<br>
separator 9. The fine separator 9 is in the form of a<br>
cartridge and filters the compressed air, which is<br>
partially free of oil, radially inwards via the outer<br>
radial wall area. From here the compressed air, which<br>
is now free of oil, is passed to an outlet 10 of the<br>
oil separator device 6 from where it is passed into the<br>
compressed-air system, which is not illustrated in any<br>
more detail.<br>
A self-resetting temperature switch 11 is arranged in<br>
the area of the inlet for the compressed air, which<br>
contains oil and is produced by the compressor unit 1,<br>
into the oil separator device itself. The temperature<br>
switch 11 switches the motor-powered compressor unit 1<br>
off if a limit temperature of 120°C is exceeded. This<br>
is done by switching off the motor 2. This prevents the<br>
ingress of excessively hot compressed air containing<br>
oil into the oil separator device 6. When the<br>
temperature of the compressed air which contains oil<br>
and is flowing in falls below the stated temperature<br>
limit value, then operation of the compressor unit 1 is<br>
resumed.<br>
An additional temperature switch 12 is provided in<br>
addition to this safety device, which prevents<br>
overheating, in the internal area of the oil separator<br><br>
WO 2006/094781	PCT/EP2006/002121<br>
- 10 -<br>
device 6. The additional temperature switch 12<br>
identifies a temperature rise initiated as a<br>
consequence of a fire or a detonation within the Oil<br>
separator device 6 and then switches off the compressor<br>
unit 1 in order to prevent further consequential<br>
damage. For this purpose, and in contrast to the other<br>
temperature switch 11, the additional temperature<br>
switch is non-self-resetting in order to prevent<br>
operation from being resumed after the rare event<br>
mentioned.<br>
in this exemplary embodiment the additional temperature<br>
switch 12 is arranged in the compressed-air flow in the<br>
area between an outlet-side pressure-maintenance valve<br>
13 and the upstream fine separator 9. This position of<br>
the additional temperature switch 12 is particularly<br>
suitable for the purpose according to the invention,<br>
since this is where the temperature rise occurs most<br>
rapidly as a result of the high flow speed of the<br>
compressed air flowing out and the proximity to the<br>
fine separator 9, with the additional temperature<br>
switch 12 in consequence reacting very quickly.<br>
As shown in Figure 2, the additional temperature switch<br>
12 which is used for the exemplary embodiment described<br>
here comprises a pressuretight outer tube 14, at whose<br>
proximal end a screw union 15 is provided. The screw<br>
union 15 is used for screwing the temperature switch 12<br>
into the housing of the oil separator device, which is<br>
not illustrated in any more detail here. A thermal fuse<br>
link 16 is accommodated at the distal end within the<br>
pressuretight tube 14 and opens when a maximum<br>
permissible limit temperature, which must be defined,<br>
is exceeded, thus interrupting the circuit formed via<br>
the two connecting lines 17. The interior of the<br>
pressuretight tube 14 is sealed with a filling compound<br>
18. The non-self-resetting temperature switch 12 is<br>
located with its active area 19 within the compressed<br><br>
WO 2006/094781	PCT/EP2006/002121<br>
- 11 -<br>
air flowing out of the oil separator device 6.<br>
The present invention is not restricted to the<br>
preferred exemplary embodiment described above.<br>
Modifications to it can also be covered by the scope of<br>
protection of the subsequent claims. For example, it is<br>
therefore also possible to use a different type of oil-<br>
injected compressor, such as a vane-cell compressor,<br>
provided this has a downstream oil separator device<br>
which, of course, does not need to be connected<br>
directly downstream from the compressor unit.<br>
Furthermore, the oil-injecting compressor unit may also<br>
be in the form of a multistage compressor unit with an<br>
oil separator device following each stage. In this<br>
case, it would be necessary to provide each oil<br>
separator device with an additional temperature switch<br>
according to the invention.<br><br>

lubrication, which is followed by an oil separator<br>
device for separation of the oil from the compressed<br>
air, with a self-resetting temperature switch (11) for<br>
switching off the compressor unit (1) when the air/oil<br>
mixture flowing in reaches a maximum temperature limit<br>
being provided in the area of the inlet of the<br>
compressed air containing oil into the oil separator<br>
device (6), in which case, furthermore, at least one<br>
additional temperature switch (12) is provided in the<br>
internal area of the oil separator device (6) and<br>
switches the compressor unit (1) off without delay in<br>
the event of a fire or detonation of the compressed air<br>
which contains oil and is contained in the oil<br>
separator device (6),<br>
characterized in that the additional temperature switch<br>
(12) is non-self-resetting, and in that its tripping<br>
results in extinguishants being forced into the<br>
internal area of the oil separator device (6).<br>
2.	The oil-injected compressor as claimed in claim 1,<br>
characterized in that the additional temperature switch<br>
(12) is in the form of a fuse link,, in order to ensure<br>
that the compressor unit (1) is reconnected only after<br>
specialist repair (Figure 2).<br>

3.	The oil-injected compressor as claimed in claim 1,<br>
characterized in that the additional temperature switch<br>
(12) which is arranged in the internal area of the oil<br>
separator device (6) is fitted in the area in which the<br>
compressed air flowing out of it is at a high flow<br>
speed.<br>
4.	The oil-injected compressor as claimed in claim 3,<br>
characterized in that the additional temperature switch<br>
(12) is arranged in the compressed-air flow in the area<br>
between an outlet-side pressure-maintenance valve (13)<br>
and a fine separator (9) upstream of the oil separator<br>
device (6) .<br>
5.	The oil-injected compressor as claimed in claim 3,<br>
characterized in that the additional temperature switch<br>
(12) is arranged on the outlet side of the compressed-<br>
air flow in the area immediately after the pressure-<br>
maintenance valve (13).<br>
6.	The oil-injected compressor as claimed in one of<br>
the preceding claims,<br>
characterized in that optical indication means signal<br>
the tripping of the additional temperature switch (12),<br>
in order to provide information about the need to<br>
repair the oil separator device (6) as a consequence of<br>
the detonation.<br>
7.	The oil-injected compressor as claimed in one of<br>
the preceding claims,<br>
characterized in that the compressor unit is in	the<br>
form of a multistage compressor unit with an	oil<br>
separator device following each stage, with	an<br>
additional temperature switch being provided on the	oil<br>
separator device of each compressor stage.<br><br>
The invention relates to an oil-injected compressor, in particular an oil-injected<br>
screw -type compressor, which comprises a motor-driven compressor unit (1) in<br>
order to produce compressed air and which co-operates with an oil circuit (5) for<br>
lubrication, which is arranged downstream from an oil, separating device (6) which<br>
is used to separate the oil from the compressed air. A self-resetting temperature<br>
switch (11), which is used to switch off the compressor unit (1) when the maximum<br>
temperature limit of the incoming compressed air is reached, is provided in the<br>
region of the inlet of the compressed air, which contains oil, in the oil separating<br>
device (6). At least one non-self-resetting additional temperature switch (12) is<br>
provided in the internal area of the oil separating device (6), which immediately<br>
switches off the compressor unit (1) following a fire or an explosion of the<br>
compressed air, which contains oil, and which is contained in the oil separating<br>
device (6).<br></td>
