  I<br>
3.	PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br><br><br>
Technical field<br>
The present invention relates to the field of induction and/or stimulation of mineral precipitation and/or biomineralization and artificial peptides able to induce and/or stimulate mineral precipitation and/or biomineralization clinically, industrially and/or chemically.<br>
Background art<br>
The hard tissues of organisms, e.g. teeth, bone, mollusk shells etc. are composed of minerals often in association with an organic polymeric phase.<br>
Biomineralization is the process by which mineral deposits within or outside cells of different organisms form the above described structures. Examples of minerals deposited include iron, gold, silicates, calcium carbonate and calcium phosphate. The cells themselves direct the process of biomineralization e.g. by the expression of proteins that act as nucleators and the production of enzymes that modify the functions of such proteins. Most proteins associated with biomineralization are anionic which allows them to interact with the charged mineral crystal surfaces.<br>
Biomimetics is defined as microstructural processing techniques that mimics or are inspired by the natural way of producing minerals, such as apatites. The means by which organisms use organic substances to grow mineral is of interest in biomimetics. For example the mineral deposition properties of biopolymers and synthetic analogoues thereof have been utilized in industrial processes, e.g. in water treatment and in electronic devices. Many man-made crystals require elevated temperatures and strong chemical solutions whereas the organisms have long been able to lay down elaborate mineral structures at ambient temperatures. Often the mineral phases are not pure but are made as composites which entail an organic part, often protein,  which takes  part in and controls the biomineralization.  These<br>
2<br><br><br>
composites are often not only as hard as the pure mineral but also tougher, as at last, the micro-environment controls biomineralization. There is therefore a great interest in the utilization of biopolymers for industrial applications to induce mineral precipitation.<br>
Also it is of great interest to utilize biopolymers in biological systems for various purposes.<br>
One such example is in medical prosthetic device technology. Bone medical prosthetic devices made of metal or metal alloys are commonly used. Some of the metals and alloys used for bone medical prosthetic devices, such as titanium, zirconium, hafnium, tantalum, niobium or alloys thereof, may form a strong bond with bone tissue. This bonding between the metal and bone tissue has been termed "osseointegration" (Branemark et al.<br>
"Osseointegrated medical prosthetic devices in the treatment of the edentulous jaw, Experience from a 10-year period", Almqvist &amp; Wiksell International, Stockholm, Sweden).<br>
When implanted into a subject, bone tissue grows onto the medical prosthetic device surfaces so that the medical prosthetic device is attached to bone tissue. However, this is a slow process under which the medical prosthetic device often may not be loaded.<br>
Therefore, it would be valuable to improve the rate at which medical prosthetic devices attach to bone.<br>
It is also of great interest to develop methods for the regeneration of mineralized tissue, such as bone, e.g. after trauma, surgical removal of bone or teeth or in connection with cancer therapy.<br><br><br>
A number of natural peptides have been shown to induce mineral precipitation. Examples include collagen 1 and 2, amelogenins, ameloblastic bone sialoprotein, enamelin, and ansocalcin. However, it is not always practical to use natural proteins for the purpose of inducing mineral precipitation and/or biomineralization. For example, natural proteins are often long, which means they are difficult to synthesize, both chemically and by bioproduction. A natural protein only contains natural amino acids, and may therefore be susceptible to rapid degradation. Also, if purified from a natural environment, such as developing teeth, there is always a risk of contamination of other products which e.g. may cause allergic reactions. In addition, a long natural protein normally has many roles in a living body and may therefore not be optimized for the induction and stimulation of mineralization.<br>
It is therefore of great interest to develop peptides and methods which allow for an improved mineralization in vitro and in vivo.<br>
Summary of invention<br>
It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide an artificial peptide with improved properties for induction and/or stimulation of mineralization, in vivo and in vitro.<br>
It is a further object to provide such a peptide which is easier to synthesize than natural proteins and to provide methods of using the peptides of the invention for the induction and/or stimulation of mineral precipitation and/or biomineralization.<br>
The above defined objects are in a first aspect of the invention achieved by providing an artificial peptide according to any of SEQ ID NO 1-8.<br><br><br>
In another aspect, the above identified objects are achieved by providing a pharmaceutical composition comprising one or more of the peptides of SEQ ID NO 1-8.<br>
In another aspect, the invention relates to the use of the peptides of the invention for the induction and/or stimulation of mineralization and/or biomineralization.<br>
Yet other aspects of the invention relates to a surface having a peptide of the invention provided thereon, and methods for providing such surfaces.<br>
The invention also relates to the in vivo induction and/or stimulation of biomineralization, as well as to the regeneration of bone.<br>
Since the amino acid sequences of the artificial peptides of SEQ ID NO 1-8 have been selected based on their mineralization inducing and/or stimulating activities, they have an improved activity in inducing and/or stimulating mineralization as compared to peptides available in the art. Further, due to their shorter length compared to natural mineralization inducing proteins, the artificial peptides of the invention are easier to synthesize.<br>

Detailed description of invention<br>
The present invention relates to artificial peptides as disclosed herein, and their use for the induction and/or stimulation of mineral precipitation and/or biomineralization e.g. onto surfaces, in tissues/or and in a solution, for the formation and/or regeneration of bone as well as for the fusion of two mineralised structures, such as two biomineralized structures or one biomineralized structure and an implantable biomaterial.<br>
In a first aspect the invention relates to an artificial peptide comprising a consensus amino acid sequence being at least 80% identical to the sequence of Pro-X-X-Pro-Y-Y-Y-Pro-X-X-Pro-Y-Y-Pro-X-X-Pro-X-Pro-Y-Y-Y-Y-Y-Y-Pro-Y-Y-Y-Y-Y-Y-Pro-X-X-Pro-X-Pro-Y-Y-Y-Pro-Y-Y-Pro-Y- Pro-X-X-Pro -Y-Pro-Y-Y-Pro-X-X-Pro-Y-Y-Pro-X-X-Pro-Y-Y -Pro-X-X-Pro-Y- Pro-Pro-X-Pro-Pro -X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-Pro-<br>
8<br><br><br>
X-X-Pro-X-X-X-X (SEQ ID NO 1), wherein a) Pro is proline; b) X is an amino acid selected from the group consisting of Ala, lie, Leu, Met, Phe, Trp and Val, preferably lie, Leu, Val and Met; c) Y is an amino acid selected from the group consisting of Asn, Cys, Gin, Ser, Thr and Tyr, preferably Ser and Gin.<br>
By a peptide having an amino acid sequence at least, for example 95% identical to a reference amino acid sequence, is intended that the amino acid sequence of the peptide is identical to the reference sequence except that the amino acid sequence may include up to 5 point mutations per each 100 amino acids of the reference amino acid sequence.<br>
In other words, to obtain a peptide having an amino acid sequence at least 95% identical to a reference amino acid sequence; up to 5% of the amino acids in the reference sequence may be deleted or substituted with another amino acid, or a number of amino acids up to 5% of the total amino acids in the reference sequence may be inserted into the reference sequence. These mutations of the reference sequence may occur at the amino or carboxy terminal positions of the reference amino acid sequence or anywhere between those terminal positions, interspersed either individually among amino acids in the reference sequence or in one or more contiguous groups within the reference sequence.<br>
Furthermore, the peptides according to the invention may comprise between 20 and 120 amino acids, such as, but not limited to, between 20-25, 25-30, 30-35, 35-40, 40-45, 45- 50, 50-60, 60-70, 70-80, 80-90, 90-100, or between 100-120 amino acids, such as, but not limited to, 21, 22, 23, 24, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 32, 33, 37, 42, 47, 49, 51, 53, 57, 59, 63, 65, 75, 85, 87, 88, 92, 95, 105, or 115 amino acids. In a preferred embodiment, the peptides according to the invention comprises between 20-50 amino acids.<br><br><br>
In the present invention, a local algorithm program is best suited to determine identity.<br>
Local algorithm programs, (such as Smith-Waterman) compare a subsequence in one sequence with a subsequence in a second sequence, and find the combination of subsequences and the alignment of those subsequences, which yields the highest overall similarity score. Internal gaps, if allowed, are penalized. Local algorithms work well for comparing two multidomain proteins, which have a single domain or just a binding site in common.<br>
Methods to determine identity and similarity are codified in publicly available programs.<br>
Preferred computer program methods to determine identity and similarity between two sequences include, but are not limited to, the GCG program package (Devereux, J et al (1994)) BLASTP, BLASTN, and FASTA (Altschul, S.F. et al (1990)). The BLASTX program is publicly available from NCBI and other sources (BLAST Manual, Altschul, S.F.<br>
et al, Altschul, S.F. et al (1990)). Another preferred example is Clustal W (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/clustalw/). Each sequence analysis program has a default scoring matrix and default gap penalties. In general, a molecular biologist would be expected to use the default settings established by the software program used.<br>
The amino acids in an artificial peptide of the invention may further be modified in terms of chemistry, isometry or in any other way as long as the sequences of the peptides are intact. Modifications of the amino acids of the artificial peptides of the invention may increase the activity, stability, biocompatibility or clinical performance of the peptides, or reduce toxicity and adverse reactions to the peptides. Examples of chemical modifications include, but are not limited to, glycosylation and methylation.<br>
10<br><br><br>
The amino acids may also be of all different types of stereoisomeric forms, such as D or L forms of amino acids, or S or R isomers. The amino acids in an artificial peptide of the invention may also be replaced by synthetic analogues thereof. The use of synthetic analogues may e.g. result in a peptide that is more stable and less prone to degradation. Examples of unnatural amino acids include; alpha* and alpha-disubstituted* amino acids, N-alkyl amino acids*, lactic acid* , halide derivatives of natural amino acids such as trifluorotyrosine * , p-CI-phenylalanine * , p-Br-phenylalanine * , p-1-phenylalanine * , L-allyl-glycine * , P-alanine* , L-a- amino butyric acid* , L-g-amino butyric acid*, L-a-amino isobutyric acid*, L-e-amino caproic acid#, 7-amino heptanoic acid* , L-methionine sulfone#* , L-norleucine * , L-norvaline * , p-nitro-L-phenylalanine*, L-hydroxyproline#, L-thioproline*, methyl derivatives of phenylalanine (Phe) such as 4-methyl-Phe*, pentamethyl-Phe*, L-Phe (4-amino)#, L-Tyr (methyl)* , L-Phe (4-isopropyl) * , L-Tic (1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline-3-carboxyl acid)*, L- diaminopropionic acid # and L-Phe (4-benzyl)* . The notation * is herein utilised to indicate the hydrophobic nature of the derivative whereas # is utilised to indicate the hydrophilic nature of the derivative, #* indicates amphipathic characteristics.<br>
Preferably, an artificial peptide according to the invention comprises an amino acid sequence as shown in SEQ ID NO 1. More preferably, the invention relates to an artificial peptide consisting of an amino acid sequence as shown in SEQ ID NO 1.<br>
The above identified SEQ ID NO 1 is an artificial (synthetic) peptide comprising a poly- proline consensus sequence, further comprising hydrophobic ("X") and polar amino acids ("Y"). This artificial consensus peptide was constructed on the basis of sequence similarities between regions in proteins and peptides that are involved in biomineralization (bone, cartilage, enamel, dentin and cementum formation) in order to obtain a peptide that induce and/or stimulate mineral precipitation in biological systems (biomineralization), and that also may be used clinically, industrially,<br>
11<br><br><br>
chemically or otherwise to stimulate the formation of calcium phosphate based structures in tissues, on medical prosthetic devices, onto surfaces, in solutions etc. The protein sequences used for constructing the artificial peptide included the sequences for collagen 1 and 2 (human, mouse and rat), amelogenin (human, mouse, rat, rabbit, pig and cow), ameloblastin (human, rat), bone sialoprotein (human, mouse), enamelin (human, mouse). The artificial peptides of the invention are particularly suitable for the induction and/or stimulation of mineral precipitation and/or biomineralization, as the amino acid sequences are optimised for this purpose. The use of an artificial peptide according to the invention is advantageous due to its shorter length compared to natural peptides, which facilitates the synthesis thereof and allows for the use of amino acid analogues as explained herein. Also, the use of an artificial peptide allows modifications of the amino acid sequence to enable the peptides to bind to e.g. metal surfaces or being easily purified, such as by the choice of amino acid sequence of the peptide itself or the use of N- and/or C-terminal tags.<br>
Therefore, in one aspect, the present invention relates to an artificial peptide comprising an amino acid sequence being at least 80% identical to SEQ ID NO 1, which is able to induce and/or stimulate mineral precipitation and/or biomineralization. Preferably, such an artificial peptide which is able to induce and/or stimulate mineral precipitation and/or biomineralization comprises an amino acid sequence as shown in SEQ ID NO 1, and more preferably such an artificial peptide consists of an amino acid sequence as shown in SEQ ID NO 1.<br>
One further embodiment of the invention relates to a shorter consensus peptide sequence comprising an amino acid sequence being at least 80% identical to the sequence of Pro- X-X-Pro-Y-Y-Pro-X-X-Pro-Y-Y-Pro-X-X-Pro-Y-Y-Pro-Y-Pro-Pro-X-Pro-Pro (SEQ ID NO 2), wherein a) Pro is proline; b) X is an amino acid selected from the group consisting of Ala, He, Leu, Met, Phe, Trp and Val, preferably<br><br><br>
lie, Leu, Val and Met; c) Y is an amino acid selected from the group consisting of Asn, Cys, Gin, Ser, Thr and Tyr, preferably Ser and Gin.<br>
SEQ ID NO 2 is constructed by the assembly of amino acids 47-50, 53-66 and 70-76 of SEQ ID NO 1, i.e. amino acids underlined in SEQ ID NO 1 above. One preferred embodiment of the invention relates to an artificial peptide comprising an amino acid sequence as shown in SEQ ID NO 2, more preferably consisting of an amino acid sequence as shown in SEQ ID NO 2. Another preferred embodiment relates to an artificial peptide comprising an amino acid sequence being at least 80% identical to SEQ ID NO 2, which is able to induce and/or stimulate mineral precipitation and/or biomineralization.<br>
Another preferred embodiment relates to an artificial peptide comprising an amino acid sequence as shown in SEQ ID NO 2, even more preferably consisting of an amino acid sequence as shown in SEQ ID NO 2, which is able to induce and/or stimulate mineral precipitation and/or biomineralization. Due to its short length, SEQ ID NO 2 is advantageous for synthetic production.<br>
The invention also relates to other artificial peptides with a specified amino acid sequence comprised in a consensus sequence of the invention. In a first aspect, such an artificial peptide is PLV PSY PLV PSY PLV PSY PYP PLPP (SEQ ID NO 3). Another preferred amino acid sequence is PLV PSQ PLV PSQ PLV PSQ PQP PLPP (SEQ ID NO 4). These two sequences are the two sequences of the invention that represent the most conserved sequences.<br>
Another aspect of the invention relates to a mineral precipitation and/or biomineralization inducing/stimulating metal binding artificial peptide comprising the amino acid sequence of PLV PCC PLV PCC PLV PCC PCP PLPP (SEQ ID NO 5) or PMM PSY PMM PSY PMM PSY PYP PMPP (SEQ ID NO 6). These two peptides have a high metal binding activity due to their content of amino acids comprising a<br>
13<br><br><br>
sulphur atom, e.g. methionine and cysteine. Such amino acids may form a sulfur bridges that may interact directly with a metal surface. The property of metal binding may be of importance when it is desirable to bind a peptide to a metal surface, such as a medical prosthetic device surface, in vivo or in vitro.<br>
Another aspect of the invention relates to an artificial peptide optimized for bone formation stimulation and/or induction comprising the amino acid sequence PLV PSS PLV PSS PLV PSS PSP PLPP (SEQ ID NO 7). This peptide comprises several Ser residues. Ser is well known to act as a signal molecule for bone formation. When a peptide according to SEQ ID NO 7 is digested, processed and/or released from a surface, it is believed that Ser will be released and act as a stimulator of bone formation.<br>
Yet another preferred embodiment of the invention relates to an artificial peptide comprising the amino acid sequence PLV PSS PLV PCC PLV PCC PSP PLPP (SEQ ID NO 8). This peptide is optimized for binding to metal surfaces, induction of biomineralization and for the release of Ser.<br>
Further aspects of the invention relates to artificial peptides having between 80-100% identity with the sequences of SEQ ID NO 1-8, such as peptides having 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 97, 98 or 99 % identity with the sequences of SEQ ID NOl-8.<br>
In preferred embodiments, the artificial peptides disclosed herein consist of SEQ ID NO 1- 8, respectively.<br>
A peptide according to the invention may further comprise N- and/or C-terminal tags comprising the amino acids His and/or Met. Met contains sulphur, which as previously explained facilitates binding to metal surfaces. His has a strong affinity for e.g. Ni and other metals. The use of these tags therefore has the advantage of enabling<br><br><br>
the peptides to attach to metal surfaces like titanium, zirconium, aluminium, tantalum, gold, surgical steel and nickel, or a metal oxide hydroxide and/or hydride surface etc. This is of great importance e.g. when a peptide of the invention is to be attached to a metal surface, such as when to be used to improve the biomineralization and/or osseointegration of a medical prosthetic device. The C- and/or N-terminal tags are also useful in the process of purification of produced peptides, as is well known to the skilled person. The use of an N- terminal and/or C-terminal tag also allows the peptide to be fully exposed, i.e. the tag is used for binding the peptide to a surface and the rest of the peptide is free for interactions with e.g. atoms, molecules, cells and tissue. The use of one tag in each end of a peptide may be useful during production of the peptide, allowing one end of the peptide being attached to a column during the purification of the peptide of interest from incomplete peptide products, while the other end of the peptide may be used for binding to a surface of interest. Consequently, one preferred embodiment of the invention relates to an artificial peptide as defined herein, further comprising an N-terminal and/or a C-terminal histidine tag. Such a tag may as previously mentioned, comprise methionine and/or histidine residues, which have been attached to an artificial peptide according to the invention. In a preferred embodiment, this tag comprises 3 or more residues, such as between 3-5 or 5-10 residues. A tag can comprise any amount of residues attached to an artificial peptide according to the invention, which still provides for a stable composition together with the artificial peptide according to the invention not affecting the secondary structure of the artificial peptide in a negative manner. Preferably this histidine tag consists of five histidine residues. In another preferred embodiment the artificial peptide comprises an N-terminal and/or C-terminal methionine tag, preferably consisting of five methionine residues. In another preferred embodiment, a peptide of the invention comprises a methionine tag in its C-or N-terminal end and a histidine tag in the other end.<br>

Due to their shorter length, compared to natural proteins, the artificial peptides of the invention are easier to produce, e.g. by synthetic production or biosynthesis. The artificial peptides of the invention may be produced by any known method for production of peptides, such as synthetic production by chemical synthesis. Synthetic production also allows the use of amino acid analogues which may improve the stability of the peptides produced. The skilled person knows what methods are available for the synthesis of an amino acid sequence.<br>
Preferably, bioproduction may be used as a method for producing the peptides.<br>
Bioproduction means the production of an amino acid sequence in a biological system, such as a cell culture or in microbial cells, e.g. bacterial cells. For bioproduction, it is necessary to construct the corresponding nucleic acid sequence encoding a specific amino acid sequence. The skilled person readily knows how to construct such a nucleic acid sequence once a specific amino acid sequence to be synthesized is determined upon, and how to produce the peptide and purify it from the system used to produce it (see e.g. Svensson J, Andersson C, Reseland JE, Lyngstadaas SP, Bulow L. Histidine tag fusion increase expression levels of active recombinant Amelogenin in Escherichia coli.<br>

The peptides of the invention may e.g. be applied on dentures, prostheses, implants, and to body cavities such as the oral, nasal and vaginal cavity.<br>
Furthermore, application within the dental/odontologic area is also of great importance.<br>
A pharmaceutically or cosmetically acceptable excipient, carrier and/or diluent is a substance which is substantially harmless to the individual to which the composition<br><br><br>
is to be administered. Such an excipient, carrier and/or diluent normally fulfils the requirements given by the national health authorities. Official pharmacopoeias such as e.g. the British Pharmacopoeia, the United States of America Pharmacopoeia and The European Pharmacopoeia set standards for pharmaceutically acceptable excipients.<br>
Whether a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient is suitable for use in a pharmaceutical composition is generally dependent on which kind of dosage form is chosen. In the following are given examples of suitable pharmaceutically acceptable excipients for use in different kinds of compositions for use according to the invention.<br>
The choice of pharmaceutically acceptable excipient(s) in a composition for use according to the invention and the optimum concentration thereof cannot generally be predicted and must be determined on the basis of an experimental evaluation of the final composition.<br>

21<br><br><br>
In one aspect, the invention relates to a surface comprising an artificial peptide according to the invention. Optionally this surface also comprises a mineral salt deposited thereon, such as calcium carbonate and/or calcium phosphate. In one preferred embodiment this surface is a metal and/or a metal oxide surface or a surface of a metal alloy and/or an oxide thereof. In one preferred embodiment said metal is titanium, zirconium, tantalum, aluminium, gold, surgical steel or nickel. In another preferred embodiment said metal oxide is titanium oxide, aluminium oxide, tantalum oxide or zirconium oxide. In yet another embodiment, a surface according to the invention is at least partially covered by an oxide of a metal or an alloy thereof comprising an artificial peptide as disclosed herein.<br>
In yet another preferred embodiment, said surface is at least partially covered by a hydride of a metal or an alloy thereof, which comprises an artificial peptide according to the invention. The hydride layer formed on a surface according to the invention may comprise any hydride of a metal or an alloy thereof, or a mixture of several different hydrides of a metal or an alloy thereof. Examples of metals which may be used in the context of the present invention for forming a hydride layer are titanium, zirconium, hafnium or tantalum, or an alloy thereof. In the case of a surface of titanium or an alloy thereof the major part of the modified outer layer, i. e. more than 50%, is preferably constituted by titanium hydride. This titanium hydride layer may also comprise small amounts of other elements and/or hydrides thereof.<br>
In one embodiment, the invention relates to a method for producing a hydride layer on a surface of a metal or an alloy thereof comprising an artificial peptide according to the invention. This may be performed either by coating a surface comprising a peptide with a layer of hydride, or by converting the surface into hydride. One preferred method for producing such a layer is to treat the implant with electrolysis. Metal hydride layers are further described in WO00/38753.<br><br><br>
In yet another preferred embodiment, said surface comprises a layer of a corresponding hydroxide material selected from a metal hydroxide such as titanium hydroxide, zirconium hydroxide, tantalum hydroxide, hafnium hydroxide, niobium hydroxide and chromium and/or vanadium hydroxide, or an hydroxide of an alloy of a metal such as of titanium, zirconium, tantalum, hafnium, niobium or chromium, or any other metal as disclosed herein which surface comprises an artificial peptide according to the invention.<br>
Furthermore, the invention also concerns a method for preparing a surface which is at least partially covered with a hydroxide layer of a metal or an alloy thereof, as disclosed herein, comprising an artificial peptide according to the invention, said method comprising subjecting surface parts of the metal material to an electrolysis treatment to form the layer of hydroxide material. Metal hydroxide layers are further described in WO03/08695.<br>
It should be noted that the formation of a hydroxide, oxide and/or a hydride layer on a surface of a metal or an alloy thereof on a surface comprising an artificial peptide according to the invention depends on the conditions used during the electrolysis treatment. In general, an electrolysis treatment can be performed as disclosed herein for forming a hydroxide, hydride and/or oxide layer on a metal or an alloy thereof which incorporates an artificial peptide according to the invention. However, during acidic conditions, mainly a hydride layer will be formed on the surface, and during basic conditions mainly a hydroxide and/or oxide layer will be formed on a surface comprising a peptide according to the invention.<br>
When the pH of the electrolyte is lower than the pi of the peptide, the net charge of the peptide will be positive. In an electrolytic cell the positively charged peptide will travel towards the negatively charged electrode where a hydride layer of a metal or an alloy thereof will be formed. If the pH is higher than the pi, the peptide will be<br>
23<br><br><br>
negatively charged and will travel towards the positively charged electrode forming a hydroxide and/or an oxide layer on a surface of a metal or an alloy thereof. This shows that a peptide according to the invention may be used both in an acidic and in a basic environment, i.e. during hydration, hydroxidation and/or oxidation of a surface of a metal or an alloy thereof.<br>
In yet another preferred embodiment said surface is a hydroxyl apatite, aragonite, bioglass, glass, polyurethane or polymeric medical prosthetic device surface. In another preferred embodiment said surface is a biological surface, as previously defined.<br>
In one preferred embodiment the surface on which an artificial peptide of the invention is provided, is a medical prosthetic device surface, such as a metallic, metal oxide, or polymeric medical prosthetic device surface. As previously mentioned, such a medical prosthetic device surface may either comprise an artificial peptide of the invention, or optionally an artificial peptide and a mineral salt. Such medical prosthetic device surfaces are believed to induce and/or stimulate mineral precipitation and/or biomineralization on the medical prosthetic device surface when it is implanted in a subject. Thereby the osseointegration of the medical prosthetic device may be increased and the outcome of implantation of the device in a subject may thereby be improved. It is also possible to attach a peptide of the invention to a medical prosthetic device prior to implantation and grow cells, as exemplified above, thereon, which cells may then be biomineralized before implantation of the medical prosthetic device in a subject. In this case, biomineralized structures may be prepared on the surface of the medical prosthetic device. Biologically precipitated mineral has a different structure and other chemical properties than inorganically precipitated mineral and therefore has a better potential for functioning in biological systems. Without being limited to a particular theory, this improved functioning of the surfaces according to the invention in biological systems may be due to the charge of the<br>
24<br><br><br>
surface as well as to the crystals forming the mineralized surface often being ordered in their structure, hence providing a more biocompatible environment than a synthetic structure. The cells may optionally be removed before implantation. Thereby a "bio-patterened", "bio-mimicking" or "bio-templating" surface may be prepared.<br>
As previously defined, a medical prosthetic device in the present context relates to any device intended to be implanted into the body of a vertebrate animal, in particular a mammal, in particular a human. Medical prosthetic devices in the present context may be used to replace anatomy and/or restore any function of the body. Non-limiting examples of such devices are medical devices that replaces anatomy or restores a function of the body such as the femoral hip joint; the femoral head; acetabular cup; elbow including stems, wedges, articular inserts; knee, including the femoral and tibial components, stem, wedges, articular inserts or patellar components; shoulders including stem and head; wrist; ankles; hand; fingers; toes; vertebrae; spinal discs; artificial joints; dental implants; ossiculoplasty implants; middle ear implants including incus, malleus, stapes, incus- stapes, malleus-incus, malleus-incus-stapes; cochlear implants; orthopaedic fixation devices such as nails, screws, staples and plates; heart valves; pacemakers; catheters; vessels; space filling implants; implants for retention of hearing aids; implants for external fixation; and also intrauterine devices (IUDs); and bioelectronic devices such as intracochlear or intracranial electronic devices.<br>
In another aspect the invention relates to a cell culture or a tissue comprising an artificial peptide according to the invention. Optionally this cell culture or tissue also comprises a mineral salt deposited therein, such as calcium carbonate and/or calcium phosphate. Said cell culture may e.g. comprise osteoblasts, osteocytes, osteoclasts, fibroblasts, stem cells, such as embryonic and mesenchymal stem cells, or progenitor, omnipotent, pluripotent and multipotent cells, muscle cells, adipocytes, cartilage or ligament cells. Said peptide and/or mineral salt is present in said cell culture and/or<br>
25<br><br><br>
tissue in any biocompatible solution and/or in a natural solution, depending on if the environment for the biomineralization is in vitro or in vivo.<br>
The artificial peptides of the invention find use in many situations where mineral precipitation and/or biomineralization is required. The invention therefore also relates to the use of an artificial peptide or pharmaceutical composition as defined herein for the induction and/or stimulation of mineral precipitation and/or biomineralization. An artificial peptide of the invention may be used for these purposes alone or in a combination of two or more peptides of the invention. The peptides of the invention may also be used together with natural proteins and/or peptides, such as amelogenins, inducing and/or stimulating mineralization and/or biomineralization. Hence one embodiment of the invention relates to a composition, such as a pharmaceutical composition, of an artificial peptide according to the present invention together with a biological polymer, such as but not limited to, amelogenin, fibrin, fibrinogen, laminin, collagen, polysaccharides, cellulose, etc.<br>
One aspect of the invention relates to the use of the artificial peptides of the invention for the induction and/or stimulation of mineralization in e.g. cell cultures, tissues, onto surfaces and/or in solutions. In another aspect, the invention relates to such cell cultures, tissues, surfaces and/or solutions comprising an artificial peptide of the invention, as described above. Such cell cultures, tissues, surfaces and/or solutions will thereby have a mineralization and/or biomineralization inducing/stimulating activity. By providing a mineral salt to such a cell culture, tissue, surface and/or solution a mineralized structure will be obtained. Hence, for in vitro purposes a mineral salt is added, not being necessary in vivo due to the salt being available naturally in the organism.<br>
As mentioned above, the artificial peptides of the invention may be used to induce mineral precipitation and/or biomineralization on a surface. Preferred examples of<br>
26<br><br><br>
such surfaces are metal surfaces, such as titanium, zirconium, aluminium, tantalum, gold, surgical steel and nickel, or any other metal as disclosed herein and metal oxide hydroxide and/or hydride surfaces etc. Examples of metal oxide surfaces include, but are not limited to, titanium oxide, aluminium oxide, tantalum oxide or zirconium oxide. Other preferred surfaces include hydroxyl apatite, aragonite, bioglass, glass, polyurethane and polymeric medical prosthetic device surfaces. Preferred examples of surfaces also include medical prosthetic device surfaces, such as metallic, metal oxide, and polymeric medical prosthetic device surfaces. Also, particularly preferred surfaces include all kinds of biological surfaces, such as a tooth root surface, a dental enamel surface, a bone surface, a graft surface, a wound surface etc.<br>
In another aspect of the invention an artificial peptide of the invention may be used for the induction and/or stimulation of mineralization of a cell culture for growth of tissues comprising cells for implantation, such as osteoblasts, osteocytes, osteoclasts, fibroblasts, stem cells, such as embryonic and mesenchymal stem cells, and progenitor, omnipotent, pluripotent and multipotent cells, muscle cells, adipocytes, cartilage or ligament cells. By also supplying a mineral salt as previously exemplified, the tissue grown may be mineralized before implantation. For this purpose an artificial peptide of the invention may be provided in solution in the cell culture medium and/or attached to the cell culture plate.<br>
Another example of a surface according to the invention is a separation column surface.<br>
Such a surface may, together with an artificial peptide of the invention, be used for the separation of mineral and toxic metals from blood. Such a surface may also be used for the precipitation of -calcium and other minerals from liquids, such as infusion liquids.<br>
27<br><br><br>
In another aspect of the present invention, mineralization and/or biomineralization is induced and/or stimulated in the presence of a surface comprising an artificial peptide of the invention. This pertains to that the stimulation and or induction of mineralization and/or biomineralization may not only be induced on the surface itself, but also in the vicinity of the surface.<br>
The present invention also relates to a method for providing a mineral precipitation and/or biomineralization inducing and/or stimulating surface comprising the steps of: b) providing a surface to be mineralised; c) providing an artificial peptide of the invention; d) contacting said peptide with said surface to provide said peptide on said surface.<br>
This method may optionally also comprise the further the step of immersing said surface with said peptide in a solution comprising a mineral salt, such as a calcium phosphate and/or calcium carbonate salt. Preferred surfaces for the present invention have been described herein.<br>
According to the present invention an artificial peptide may be used for the in vivo induction of bone, cartilage, cementum and/or dental tissue formation and/or regeneration.<br>
In one preferred embodiment, step c) in the method above is performed using an electric current. In this case preferably, the pH in an electrolyte comprising the peptide is below the pi of the peptide, the current below 20 V, the charge density between 0,1 - 1000 mA per square centimetres. Preferably, the temperature ranges from room temperature to 6Q degrees Celcius. The pH may be adjusted with any acid, preferably acetic acid or another organic acid (tartaric acid, maleic acid, oxalic acid etc), but it is also possible t0 use HCI, HF and H3P04. The electrolyte preferably comprises 0.005-1.0 M of a salt, preferably a calcium containing salt, but it is also possible to use NaCl or other salts.<br>
28<br><br><br>
The present invention also relates to a method for the in vivo induction and/or stimulation of biomineralization in the presence of a medical prosthetic device, such as on the medical prosthetic device or in the surrounding tissue, in a subject, comprising the steps of: a) providing an mineral precipitation and/or biomineralization inducing and/or stimulating medical prosthetic device surface produced by a method as described above; b) implanting said medical prosthetic device into said subject.<br>
When the peptide according to the invention is used for inducing the biomineralization of a medical prosthetic device, different strategies may be used. Independently on the strategy chosen, the first step is always to cover the medical prosthetic device with the peptide, as described herein. The next step may then be to immerse the medical prosthetic device in a solution comprising at least one mineral salt for in vitro purposes, as previously described. Thereby the mineral deposits on the surface of the medical prosthetic device, providing a mineralized surface. The medical prosthetic device is thereafter implanted into a subject, where the artificial peptide and nucleation foci on the surface aid further mineral deposition in vivo. In an alternative approach, the medical prosthetic device is first covered by the peptide as previously mentioned. The medical prosthetic device is then implanted into a subject, where the peptide aids in mineral deposition on the medical prosthetic device surface.<br>
Any suitable method known to the skilled person may be used for the attachment of a peptide according to the invention to a surface. An example of a preferred method for attachment of the peptides are described in e.g. Hayakawa et al (Hayakawa, T., Yoshinari, M., and Nemoto K. Direct attachment of fibronectin to tresyl chloride-activated titanium. J Biomed Mater Res A, 2003, 67(2): 684-8) which describe the usage of tresyl chloride to attach a peptide to the surface of titanium implant. This method provides a limited release of the peptide from the surface and is used in example 5 in the experimental section. Another preferred method for attaching a<br>
29<br><br><br>
peptide according to the invention to a surface is described in lmamura et al. (Imamura, K., Kawasaki, Y., Nagayasu, T,, Sakiyama, T., and Nakanishi, K. Adsorption characteristics of oligopeptides composed of acidic and basic amino acids on titanium surface. J Biosci Bioeng, 2007, 103 (1): 7-12.), disclosing the usage of the natural properties of the peptides to adhere to a titanium surface via their negatively charged carboxylic groups. This way of attaching a peptide according to the invention to a surface is illustrated in example 6 in the experimental section, and provides for a passive adsorption and release of the peptides into the tissues and/or cells surrounding the implant. As previously mentioned herein, a peptide according to the invention may also be attached to a surface by the use of N- and/or C-terminal tags comprising the amino acids His and/or Met.<br>
There are several ways available to the skilled person to investigate if bone formation occurs on and/or around an implant with a peptide according to the invention. One way to detect the level of osteoblastic cell activity in a tissue with an implant is to detect the levels of the transcriptional factor runx2/Cbfa-l, which regulates the expression of bone extracellular matrix protein genes that encode for bone sialoprotein, osteocalcin and collage type I (Lian et al., Current Pharmaceutical Design, 2003, 9, 2677-2685). TRAP (Tartrate-Resistant Acid Phosphatase) expression may also be used to study bone resorption by osteoclastic cells in tissues, wherein a decrease in TRAP expression is indicative of a reduced bone resorption. Hence, the TRAP expression profile could give an indication of the presence of differentiated osteoclasts at the bone-implant interface (Minkin et al., "Role of the osteoclast at the bone-implant interface" Adv Dent Res 13:49- 56, June, 1999).<br>
LDH (Lactat dehydrogenase) activity may be used in the context of the present invention to investigate the biocompatibility of an implant with a peptide according to the invention, wherein a decreased activity indicates improved biocompatibility. LDH activity is present in the wound fluid, which is released from the inflamed bone<br>
30<br><br><br>
tissue, and can be used as a marker of tissue necrosis at the bone-implant interface. (Michael Messieh, "Synovial Fluid levels of Lactate Dehydrogenase in Patients with Total Knee Arthroplasty, The Journal of Arthroplasty Vol. 11 No.4, 1996; Michael Messieh, Levels of Lactate Dehydrogenase in Osteoarthritic and Failed Total Knee Joints, The Journal of Arthroplasty Vol. 11 No.3, 1996) In another aspect, the invention relates to a method for the in vivo induction and/or stimulation of biomineralization comprising the administration of an artificial peptide or a pharmaceutical composition comprising an artificial peptide as disclosed herein to a subject in need thereof. In order to achieve this, an artificial peptide of the invention is administered, alone or comprised in a pharmaceutical composition as disclosed herein , to the tissue of interest. The peptide may be administered in any suitable way depending on the intended use, such as by systemic and/or local injection and/or perfusion. When a peptide of the invention is administered to a tissue it may induce biomineralization and further bone formation. Examples of tissue of interest in the present context include bone, cartilage, cementum and teeth. Examples of conditions that may lead to bone fractures include, but are not limited to, bone resection, e.g. at trauma, tumours, cysts, and infections or inflammations, such as periodontitis, periimplantitis or ostitis. The peptide according to the invention may be administered to a subject in need thereof suffering from such a condition. The peptide, optionally with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, is preferably directly applied to the tissue. An artificial peptide of the invention may also be applied to a tissue or cell culture in vitro in order to induce mineral precipitation. For both the situation in vivo and in vitro, examples of cells that a peptide of the invention is of interest to be administered to are osteoblasts, osteocytes, osteoclasts, fibroblasts, stem cells, such as embryonic and mesenchymal stem cells, and progenitor, omnipotent, pluripotent and multipotent cells, muscle cells, adipocytes, cartilage and ligament cells.<br>
Although not whishing to be bound by theory, one may envisage that a peptide of the invention may induce bone formation by the initiation of precipitation of calcium<br>
31<br><br><br>
phosphate and/or the stimulation of cells involved in the formation of bone structures, such as osteoclasts or osteoblasts. Experiments performed by the inventors have shown that peptides comprising a consensus peptide of the invention may bind calcium. Also, experiments have demonstrated that a consensus sequence according to the invention may bind to a receptor involved in the biomineralization process.<br>
A peptide of the invention and/or a pharmaceutical composition comprising such a peptide may be administered to a subject in need thereof by any suitable route depending on the tissue which the peptide is to be administered to, for example by topical (dermal), oral, buccal, nasal, aural, rectal or vaginal administration, or by administration to a body cavity such as, e.g., a tooth root, a tooth root canal or a bone fracture. Furthermore, a composition may be adapted to administration in connection with surgery, e.g. in connection with incision within the body. The peptides of the invention may also be administered via local injections, by application in a gel or via a medical device, such as a medical prosthetic device, e.g. a graft, scaffold or bioglass material. It is also possible to administer the peptides via alginate or citosan (slow release) beads, a toothpaste (which would enable remineralization of enamel together with fluoride), in a shampoo (with calcium, which would provide a hair strengthening and/or thickening composition), in a dental filling material (composite or in combination with root filling materials for induction of bone healing apically to the tooth). If administrated locally, as such or in a pharmaceutical composition comprising a peptide of the invention, into e.g. a fracture, periodontal defect, extraction alveolas or sinus lift procedure, the peptides of the invention may improve and/or speed up bone healing in the cases. The peptides probably act by inducing mineral depositions that function as "seeds" for further bone formation including differentiation and maturation of bone cells.<br>
For the administration for the treatment of osteoporosis the peptide may be encapsulated and delivered orally by ingestion, by the nasal cavity or lungs by<br>
32<br><br><br>
inhalation or by injection into the blood, into the spinal fluid (spine fractures), into joints (to heal cartilage defects or degenerative changes to articulating surfaces) or intraperitoneal as a slow release depot.<br>
In another aspect the invention relates to an artificial peptide as defined herein for use as a medicament. In particular the invention relates to the use of the artificial peptide and'or pharmaceutkai composition for the preparation of a medicament for the induction of biomineralization. In particular the invention also relates to the use of an artificial peptide and/or a pharmaceutical composition comprising an artificial peptide for the preparation of a medicament for the formation and/or regeneration of bone. In a particular embodiment, the invention also relates to the use of an artificial peptide and/or a pharmaceutical composition comprising an artificial peptide for the preparation of a medicament for the formation and/or regeneration of bone cartilage, cementum and/or dental tissue. The peptides of the invention and/or pharmaceutical compositions comprising these peptides may also be used for the preparation of medicaments for the treatment of osteoporosis, fractures, periodontitis, traumas, bone metabolic syndrome, pulitis, dental apical lesions, etc.<br>
The peptides of the invention and/or pharmaceutical compositions comprising these peptides may also be used for the preparation of a medicament for the healing of bone fractures.<br>
In one aspect the invention also relates to an artificial peptide and/or a pharmaceutical composition comprising an artificial peptide as disclosed herein for use for the induction of biomineralization. For example an artificial peptide and/or a pharmaceutical composition comprising an artificial peptide according to the invention may be used for the preparation of a medicament for the formation and/or regeneration of bone cartilage, cementum and/or dental tissue.<br>
33<br><br><br>
In another aspect, the invention relates to an artificial peptide and/or a pharmaceutical composition comprising an artificial peptide as disclosed herein for use for the formation and/or regeneration of bone.<br>
In yet another aspect, the invention relates to an artificial peptide and/or a pharmaceutical composition comprising an artificial peptide as disclosed herein for use for the healing of bone fractures.<br>
The artificial peptides of the invention may also be used in combination with natural peptides inducing mineral precipitation and/or biomineralization and/or bone formation, such as amelogenins. It is also possible to use a combination of two or more peptides of the invention for the induction and/or stimulation of mineral precipitation, including biomineralization.<br>

Examples of such materials include implantable biomaterials, such as titanium and steel, biogiass, calcium phosphates, apatite etc. Other examples include column material, filter materials etc.<br>
Experimental section Example 1 A peptide based, mineral-inducing coating on a titanium surface Eight coin shaped implants with a diameter of 6.25 mm, was attached to an titanium electrode and submerged in an sterile electrolyte containing 0,5 M NaCl, adjusted to pH 8.0 by the use of 1.0 M NaOH, and a synthetic poly-proline peptide designed to stimulate nucleation of calcium phosphate crystals. The peptide, having a pi of 5.82, had the following sequence: PLV PSY PLV PSY PLV PSY PYP PLPP (SEQ ID NO:3), and was applied at a final concentration of 0.01 mg/ml in the electrolyte. The electrode was attached to the positive outlet of a power<br>
34<br><br><br>
supply, and an electrical current of 10 Volts at 100 mA at a cell temperature of 40 degrees Celsius, was applied for eight hours. The electrolytic process produced a thin peptide coating onto the oxidized titanium surface visible as a greyish precipitation. After coating the titanium specimens were rinsed in sterile water and subsequently put into sterile glass containers where they were allowed to air-dry. Eight identical titanium specimens, treated identically as the test specimens with the exception that no peptides were added to the electrolyte, was produced as controls.<br>
After drying, the titanium specimens (peptide coated and controls) were submerged in 50ml of a saturated solution of calcium phosphate at 50 degrees Celsius. The solution was then allowed to cool to room temperature and incubated at 25 degrees Celsius for 48 hours. The titanium specimens were then removed from the solution, rinsed briefly in sterile water and air-dried in a desiccator. When dry, the implants were directly analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) for quantitative and qualitative assessment of the number and nature of mineral precipitation foci present on their surfaces. The number of mineral forming units (mfu) on the surface directly corresponds to the number of mineral nucleation sites present on the surface during the experiments.<br>
The results (Table 1) demonstrate that the titanium specimens that had their surfaces coated with the synthetic poly-proline peptide had a significantly (p

Example 2: A synthetic poly-proline peptide coating promoting mineral precipitation on a medical titanium implant surface A layer of a synthetic poly-proline peptide with the sequence PLV PSQ PLV PSQ PLV PSQ PQP PLPP (SEQ ID NO:4) and a pi of 5.55 that has the potential to act as a biological nucleator of mineral formation was used for coating medical implants made of titanium. The peptide was coated onto eight sterile dental implants with a total surface area of about 1 square centimetre using a galvanic cell. The electrolyte used in was 1M NaCI in sterile water with pH adjusted to pH 2 by means of HCI, and the initial concentration of the synthetic poly-proline was 0.1 mg per ml electrolyte. A voltage of 10 volts at a current density of 1 mA/cm2 was used. At this pH the poly-proline peptide is negatively charged and will migrate towards the positive electrode to which the implants were attached. The process was run at ambient temperature. Electrolysis was allowed to progress for 4 hours after which the titanium implants were removed from the galvanic cell, rinsed in sterile water and allowed to air-dry in a desiccator. Eight control implants were produced in an identical setup, but without the synthetic poly-proline peptide.<br>
After drying, the titanium implants (peptide coated and controls) were submerged in 50ml of a saturated solution of calcium phosphate at 50 degrees Celsius. The solution was then allowed to cool to room temperature and incubated at 25 degrees Celsius for 24 hours.<br>
The titanium specimens were then removed from the solution, rinsed briefly in sterile water and air-dried in a desiccator. When dry, the implants were directly analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) for quantitative and qualitative assessment of the number and nature of mineral precipitation foci present on their surfaces. The number of mineral forming units (mfu) on the surface directly corresponds to the number of mineral nucleation sites present on the surface during the experiments.<br>

Example 3: Testing of titanium implants having their biocompatibility improved by electrolytic deposition of a consensus peptide in the surface Eight coin shaped, machined implants with a diameter of 6.25 mm, will be attached to a titanium electrode and submerged in an sterile electrolyte containing 0.5 M NaCI adjusted to pH 8.0 by the use of 1.0 M NaOH, and containing 0.1 mg/ml of an artificial peptide of the invention (pl
<br><br>
The implants with consensus peptide coated surfaces (n=8) and controls (n=8) will be placed in calibrated cortical bone defects in the tibia of rabbits (New Zealand White). A small central fenestration into the bone marrow beneath each implant will be made to allow for migration of osteogenic cells to the implant surfaces. The methods used will all be according to a standardized and validated model established for the study of bone attachment to titanium implant surfaces (Ronold, H.J. and Ellingsen, J.E. The use of a coin shaped implant for direct in situ measurement of attachment strength for osseointegrating biomaterial surfaces. Biomaterials 23 ;2201-2209 (2002)). Each rabbit will receive four implants, two in each tibia bone. Location of test and control implants will be randomized and the operator will be blinded. At six weeks after implantation the rabbits will be sacrificed and the tibia bones with the implants attached will be excised. Directly after excising the tibia bone will be fixed in a specially designed jig, and the implant will be detached using a calibrated pull-out procedure measuring the strength of the bonding between the implant and the bone. The force needed to detach the implants will be recorded in Newton (N).<br>
The results are expected to demonstrate that the titanium implants that had surfaces coated by a consensus peptide were more strongly attached to cortical bone than the untreated control implants after six weeks of healing. This result will be clinically important as early bone attachment is a sign of reduced bone healing time. This is important for successful clinical outcomes of "early loading" strategies in orthopedic and dental implant treatments.<br>
Example 4: Preparation of a osteoinductive titanium implant surface containing a consensus peptide Eight coin shaped, machined implants with a diameter of 6.25 mm, will be attached to a titanium electrode and submerged in an sterile electrolyte containing 0.5 M NaCl, adjusted to pH 5.0 by the use of 1.0 M HCI, and containing 0.01 mg/ml of an artificial peptide according to the invention (pl&gt;5.0, peptides are ampholytes having a net positive charge when the pH is lower than the pi of the<br>

molecule). The electrode will be attached to the negative outlet of a power supply, using a net charge density at the implant surface of lmA/cm2. The process will be allowed to run for 1 hour at 50 degrees Celsius. The electrolytic process will produce implants surfaces with a thin coating with the consensus peptide. After electrolysis the implants will be rinsed in sterile water and subsequently put into sterile glass containers where they will be allowed to air-dry. Eight implants will be treated the same way, but without the consensus peptide, and included as controls.<br>
The titanium implants with peptide modified surfaces (n=8) and controls (n=8) will be placed in calibrated cortical bone defects in the tibia of rabbits (New Zealand White). A small central fenestration into the bone marrow beneath each implant will be made to allow for migration of osteogenic cells to the implant surfaces. The methods used will all be according to a standardized and validated model established for the study of bone attachment to titanium implant surfaces (Ronold, HJ. and Ellingsen.J.E.

Example 5: Experiments performed with Peptide: PLV PSQ PLV PSQ PLV PSQ PQP PLP P (SEQ ID NO:4) 1. Materials and methods 1. 1 Titanium coins Commercially pure (cp) machined titanium implants with a diameter of 6.25 mm and a height of 1.95 mm were cleaned and sterilized before use. Briefly, implants were washed together in a glass beaker with deionised water for 30 s, then with 70% ethanol for 30 s, and then with ultrasonic bath at 400C for 5 min in deionised water. The implants were subsequently placed in 40% NaOH solution in a water bath of 400C for 10 min, sonicated in deionised water for 5 min, and then washed with deionised water until the pH reached 6. Afterwards the implants were sonicated in deionised water at 50°C for 5 min, placed in 50% HN03 solution at 50°C for 10 min, and sonicated in deionised water for another 5 min. The implants were washed with deionised water until reached pH=6 and were stored in 70% ethanol. Before use, the coins were rinsed with water, rinsed with ethanol, sonicated for 5 min at room temperature and rinsed with deionised water. The titanium coins were then sterilised by autoclaving at 121 °C for 15 min.<br>
1. 2 Preparation of peptide solution The peptide (PLV PSQ PLV PSQ PLV PSQ PQP PLP P) (SEQ ID NO 4) was dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) with pH=7.4 at a concentration of 20 mg/ml. This solution was further dissolved in PBS to a final concentration of 0.1 mg/ml.<br>
1.3. Activation of titanium implants with tresyl chloride and coupling with peptide The surface of the machined titanium implant was first covered with 10 ul of tresyl chloride (2,2,2-trifluoroethanesulfonyl chloride) and incubated at 370C for 2 days. Then, the tresylated titanium implant was washed with water, water-acetone (50:50), acetone, and dried in a desiccator.<br>
40<br><br><br>
Peptide solution (10 ul, 0.1 mg/ml) was applied to the surface of the titanium implant and incubated for 24h at 37°C, then rinsed with water. Finally, implants were dried in a desiccator, packed and stored at 4 0C.<br>
Control implants were activated with tresyl chloride but no peptide was added subsequently. Method used for binding peptide to titanium implants with tresyl chloride was adapted from (Hayakawa et al, 2003).<br>
1.4 Animal study Six New Zealand White female rabbits, 6 months old and a weight of 3.0-3.5 kg, were used in this study (ESF ProdukterEstuna AB, Norrtalje, Sweden).<br>
The implants with consensus peptide coated surfaces (n=12) and controls (n=12) were placed in calibrated cortical bone defects in the tibia of rabbits (New Zealand White). A small central fenestration into the bone marrow beneath each implant was made to allow for migration of osteogenic cells to the implant surfaces. The methods used were all according to a standardized and validated model established for the study of bone attachment to titanium implant surfaces (Rtfnold and Ellingsen, 2002). Each rabbit received four implants, two in each tibia bone. Location of test and control implants was randomized and the operator was blinded. At four weeks after implantation the rabbits were sacrificed and the tibia bones with the implants attached were excised. Directly after excising the tibia bone was fixed in a specially designed jig, and the implants were detached using a calibrated pull-out procedure. The implants were then directly transferred to a sterile tube and processed for RNA and protein extraction, for the analysis of expression of bone markers and necrosis.<br>
1.5. In vivo gene expression of bone markers: runx2, osteocalcin and TRAP.<br>
Gene expression of runx2, osteocalcin and TRAP was studied using real-time RT-PCR as an indication of bone formation (runx2, osteocalcin) or bone resorption<br>
41<br><br><br>
(TRAP) in the peri-implant bone tissue attached to the surface of the different implants.<br>
1.6 Wound fluid analyses; LDH activity and total protein LDH activity and total protein was analysed in the wound fluid collected from the implant site following a 4 week healing period. The release of LDH is a sensitive marker for tissue necrosis (Williams et al, 1983) and thus the biocompatibility of the implants. The amount of total protein was used to normalize for errors caused by differences in the number of bone cells on the detached implants.<br>
2. Conclusion The implants coated with the consensus peptide showed a significant increase in osteocalcin expression indicating that osteoblastic cell activity was improved in these samples. Moreover, a decrease in TRAP expression was observed suggesting that bone resorption by osteoclastic cells was significantly reduced in these samples. Together these effects add up to a net increase in bone formation adjacent to implants coated with the consensus peptide. Moreover, the decrease in LDH activity in the periimplant tissue indicates that the presence of the consensus peptide significantly improved the biocompatibility of the titanium implant. These results are illustrated in Figures 1-4.<br>
Example 6: Experiments performed with Peptide: PLV PSQ PLV PSQ PLV PSQ PQP PLP P (SEQ ID NO 4) 1. Materials and methods 1. 1 Titanium coins Commercially pure (cp) machined titanium implants with a diameter of 6.25 mm and a height of 1.95 mm were cleaned and sterilized before use. Briefly, implants were washed together in a glass beaker with deionised water for 30 s, then with 70% ethanol for 30 s, and then with ultrasonic bath at 4O0C for 5 min in deionised water. The implants were subsequently placed in 40% NaOH solution in a water bath of 400C for 10 min, sonicated in deionised water for 5 min, and then washed with deionised water until the pH reached 6. Afterwards the implants were sonicated in<br>
42<br><br><br>
deionised water at 500C for 5 min, placed in 50% HN03 solution at 5O0C for 10 min, and sonicated in deionised water for another 5 min. The implants were washed with deionised water until reached pH=6 and were stored in 70% ethanol. Before use, the coins were rinsed with water, rinsed with ethanol, sonicated for 5 min at room temperature and rinsed with deionised water. The titanium coins were then sterilised by autoclaving at 121 0C for 15 min.<br>
1. 2 Preparation of peptide solution The peptide (PLV PSQ PLV PSQ PLV PSQ PQP PLP P) (SEQ ID NO 4) was dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) with pH=7.4 at a concentration of 20 mg/ml. This solution was further dissolved in PBS to a final concentration of 0.1 mg/ml.<br>
1.3	Adsorption of peptide to titanium implants (physical adsorption) Peptides can be physically adsorbed onto a titanium surface, as an alternative method for covalent binding. Negatively charged carboxylic groups show a strong affinity for metal oxide surfaces and can therefore directly interact with the titanium surface (Imamura et al, 2007). Peptide solution (10 ul 0.1 mg/ml) was applied to the surface of the titanium implant and incubated for 24h at 37°C. After 24h, titanium implants were rinsed and packed with the same method as described above. Control implants were treated with 10 ul of PBS without adding peptide.<br>

The implants with consensus peptide coated surfaces (n=12) and controls (n=12) were placed in calibrated cortical bone defects in the tibia of rabbits (New Zealand White). A small central fenestration into the bone marrow beneath each implant was made to allow for migration of osteogenic cells to the implant surfaces.

Gene expression of runx2, osteocalcin and TRAP was studied using real-time RT-PCR as an indication of bone formation (runx2, osteocalcin) or bone resorbtion (TRAP) in the peri- implant bone tissue attached to the surface of the different groups of implants.<br>
1.6 Wound fluid analyses: LDH activity and total protein LDH activity and total protein was analysed in the wound fluid collected from the implant site following a 4 week healing period. The release of LDH is a sensitive marker for tissue necrosis [Williams et al, 1983] and thus the biocompatibility of the implants. The amount of total protein was used to normalize for errors caused by differences in the number of bone cells on the detached implants.<br>
2. Conclusion The implants coated with the consensus peptide showed a significant increase in the expression of the pro-osteogenic markers Osteocalcin and Runx2, strongly indicating that osteoblastic cell activity was improved in these samples. Moreover, a decrease in TRAP expression was observed, suggesting that bone resorption by osteoclastic cells was significantly reduced in these samples. Together these effects add up to a significant net increase in bone formation in the tissue adjacent to implants coated with the consensus peptide. Moreover, the observed decrease in LDH activity in the periimplant tissue indicates that the consensus peptide<br>
