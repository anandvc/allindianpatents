METHOD AND DEVICE FOR ENHANCING THE BRAKING EFFICIENCY OF AN AIRCRAFT DURING THE GROUND RUN THEREOF<br>
The present invention relates to a method and a device for enhancing the braking efficiency of an aircraft taxiing on the ground.<br>
It is known that current airplanes, in particular civil transport airplanes, have an elongated fuselage supported, on the ground, by a main landing gear, disposed in an intermediate position of said fuselage, and by a steerable front landing gear, normally called nose gear. Furthermore, the wheels of the main landing gear are provided with brakes, whereas said front landing gear, which is used for laterally guiding the airplane on the ground, has wheels without brakes.<br>
The consequence of these arrangements is that, when such an airplane taxiing on the ground has the brakes applied, the braking force exerted by the wheels of the main landing gear generates a nose-down moment tending to lessen the load on said main landing gear and increase the load on said front landing gear. Consequently, the main landing gear is not applied to the ground with sufficient pressure to afford the airplane optimal braking efficiency.<br>
The object of the present invention is to remedy this drawback and to confer on such an airplane taxiing on the ground a braking efficiency that is always optimal.<br>
To this end, according to the invention, the method for enhancing the braking efficiency of an aircraft taxiing on the ground, said aircraft comprising an elongated fuselage and being provided: - with a main landing gear, disposed in an intermediate<br>
position of  said  fuselage  and  comprising wheels<br>
provided with brakes;<br><br>
-	with a steerable front landing gear, disposed at the front of said fuselage and being used to laterally guide said aircraft on the ground, said front landing gear comprising wheels without brakes; and<br>
-	with controllable aerodynamic surfaces disposed at the rear of the fuselage and capable of generating a variable negative lift force,<br>
is noteworthy in that:<br>
-	in a preliminary phase, a reference value is determined for the vertical force exerted by the ground on said front landing gear, said reference value being capable of ensuring a satisfactory efficiency of said front landing gear for the lateral guiding of said aircraft when the latter is taxiing on the ground; then<br>
-	while said aircraft taxiing on the ground is braking:<br><br>
•	the instantaneous vertical force actually exerted by the ground on said front landing gear is measured; and<br>
•	said rear aerodynamic surfaces are controlled so that they generate a negative lift value capable of maintaining said instantaneous vertical force at a value at least approximately equal to said reference value.<br>
Thus, with the present invention, a nose-up moment is created opposing said braking nose-down moment, and the braking efficiency of the aircraft is increased - and therefore the length of runway needed for the latter to stop is reduced - by controlling the vertical force on the front landing gear - while retaining sufficient capability for the front landing gear to laterally guide the aircraft. It will also be noted that, by deflecting said rear aerodynamic surfaces, the drag of the aircraft is increased, which favors the braking.<br>
Said reference value for the vertical force exerted by the ground on said front landing gear can be determined by  calculation  or  indeed  by  direct  experimental<br><br>
measurement on said front landing gear. It is chosen to allow for sufficient lateral control of the aircraft and to retain a margin of power on the control column.<br>
When said aircraft comprises, for controllable rear aerodynamic surfaces, both an adjustable horizontal stabilizer and elevators hinged on said stabilizer, the generation of said negative lift value cari be obtained by action on said adjustable horizontal stabilizer, or by action on said elevators, or even by simultaneous actions on said adjustable horizontal stabilizer and on said elevators.<br>
However, implementing the method according to the present invention is particularly easy when the elevators alone are used. In practice, all that is then needed is to modify, while the aircraft is taxiing with the brakes applied, the characteristic of the aircraft giving the deflection of the elevators according to the deflection command controlled so that, when the latter is zero, the deflection angle of said elevators assumes a nose-up value.<br>
The present invention also relates to a device for implementing the method described above. In addition to the means generating a characteristic giving the deflection angle of the elevators according to a deflection command, said characteristic having a neutral point, the device according to the invention can comprise:<br>
-	means for continuously measuring the vertical force exerted on said steerable front landing gear, when said aircraft is taxiing on the ground with the brakes being applied;<br>
-	memory means, in which is stored said reference value;<br>
-	comparison means receiving said continuous measurement of said vertical force and said reference value and calculating the difference;<br><br>
-	computation means receiving said difference and a measurement of the taxiing speed of said aircraft and delivering, for the deflection angle of said elevators, a nose-up value that is non-zero when the deflection command is zero, said non-zero nose-up value decreasing with the speed of the aircraft;<br>
-	computation means which, from said non-zero nose-up value, determine a modified characteristic giving the deflection angle of the elevators according to the deflection command; and<br>
-	switching means for applying to said elevators either said usual characteristic, or said modified characteristic, depending on whether the wheels of the main landing gear have the brakes applied or not.<br>
The figures of the appended drawing will give a good understanding of how the invention can be applied. In these figures, identical references denote similar elements.<br>
Figure 1 shows, in diagrammatic perspective from above, a wide-bodied civil aircraft.<br>
Figures 2A, 2B and 2C illustrate the method of the present invention.<br>
Figure 3 shows a usual airplane characteristic indicating the value of the deflection angle δq of the elevators of said airplane according to the deflection command 8m.<br>
Figures 4 and 5 show two examples of characteristic δq, 8m modified in accordance with the present invention.<br>
Figure 6 is the block diagram of an exemplary embodiment of a system implementing the method according to the present invention.<br><br>
The wide-bodied airplane 1, shown diagrammatically in flight in figure 1, comprises a fuselage 2, elongated along a longitudinal axis L~L, and wings 3, provided with trailing edge flaps 4 and leading edge slats 5. It also comprises a horizontal stabilizer 6 with tilt adjustment, as illustrated by the double arrow 7. On the rear edge of said adjustable horizontal stabilizer 6, are hinged elevators 8 that can turn relative to said horizontal stabilizer 6, as is illustrated by the double arrows 9.<br>
Moreover, as is illustrated in figures 2A, 2B and 2C, the airplane 1 comprises a main landing gear 10, disposed in an intermediate position relative to the fuselage 2 and provided with wheels 11 equipped - in a manner that is known and not represented - with brakes, and a steerable front landing gear 12 (normally called nose gear), disposed at the front of the fuselage 2 and used to guide said airplane 1, when the latter is taxiing on the ground. Said front landing gear 12 comprises wheels 13 without brakes.<br>
In figures 2A, 2B and 2C, the airplane 1 is represented in three different situations, while it is moving on the ground S in the direction A with a speed V, bearing on its landing gears 10 and 12, the wheels 11 and 13 of which are rolling on said ground S. In each of these situations, the wings 3 and the associated flaps and slats 4, 5 generate an equal lift P, whereas the horizontal stabilizer 6 and/or the elevators 8 generate a negative lift DP of value DPI or DP2. In the three situations, the airplane 1 is subject to the action of its weight Mxg, an expression in which M represents the mass of said airplane and g the gravity acceleration.<br>
In the situation represented in figure 2A, it is assumed that the airplane 1, subject to the action of the lift P, of the weight Mxg and of a weak negative lift DPI  (due to a normal setting of the horizontal<br><br>
stabilizer 6 with the elevators 8 in aerodynamic extension with said stabilizer), is taxiing freely on the ground S, the wheels 11 not having the brakes applied. The result is then that the gears 10 and 12 are respectively subject to vertical forces Ftp and Fav of respective values Ftpl and Favl, the force Favl exerted on the front landing gear 12 being appropriate to the ground guidance function of the airplane 1 having to be exerted by said front landing gear 12. Of course, the values of Favl and Ftpl depend on the negative lift DPI, on the weight Mxg, on the longitudinal position of the center of gravity of the airplane 1, on the lift P (that is, the speed V and the configuration of the flaps 4 and slats 5) and on the longitudinal aerodynamic moment.<br>
In figure 2B, it is assumed that, based on the situation of figure 2A, the brakes of the wheels 11 of the main landing gear 10 are actuated to produce a braking force B in order to enable said airplane to be stopped, either on landing, or on interrupting a takeoff. This braking force generates a nose-down moment CB, increasing the load on the front landing gear 12 and reducing the load on the main landing gear 10, such that the vertical force Ftp assumes a value Ftp2 less than Ftpl, whereas the vertical force Fav assumes a value Fav2 greater than Favl. Since the load on the main landing gear 10 is reduced, its wheels 11 are not applied optimally on the ground S and the braking force B is limited exceptionally to a value Bl which is not optimal.<br>
To make it possible to increase the braking force beyond the value Bl, the method according to the present invention (see figure 2C) involves the adjustable horizontal stabilizer 6 and/or the elevators 8 to increase, at least while the wheels 11 have the brakes applied, the negative lift DP to a value DP2, greater than DPI. The result is that this increase in<br><br>
negative lift creates a nose-up moment CDP which opposes the action of the braking moment CB and which, when the wheels 11 of the main landing gear 10 have the brakes applied, reduces the load on the front landing gear 12 and loads the main landing gear 10. The vertical force Fav on the front landing gear 12 can then assume a value Fav3 less than Fav2, whereas the vertical force Ftp on the main landing gear 10 can assume a value Ftp3 greater than Ftp2.<br>
Thus, by giving the negative lift DP a value DP2 greater than the usual value DPI used in the situations of figures 2A and 2B, the force Ftp is increased beyond the value Ftp2, such that the wheels 11 are correctly applied to the ground S and that the braking force can assume a value B2, greater than Bl, which makes the braking more efficient. Furthermore, the value DP2 is chosen such that the value Fav3 assumed by the vertical force Fav on the front landing gear 12 allows said front landing gear 12, just like Favl, to be used to guide the airplane 1 on the ground.<br>
The method according to the present invention therefore consists in controlling, to the value Fav3 used as a reference, the vertical force Fav exerted by the ground on the front landing gear 12, by controlling the negative lift DP.<br>
As mentioned above, the increase in the negative lift DP from the value DPI to the value DP2 can be obtained by action of the adjustable horizontal stabilizer 6, or by action of the elevators 8 or even by combined action of the adjustable horizontal stabilizer 6 and of the elevators 8. However, in an embodiment that is particularly easy to implement, it is advantageous to involve only the elevators 8.<br>
It is known in fact, in a known manner, as is illustrated by the curve 14 of figure 3,  that the<br><br>
characteristic of the airplane 1 giving, in a system of rectangular axes, the deflection angle δq of the elevators 8 according to the deflection command δq on the control column comprises a nose-down portion PAP, normally linear, and a nose-up portion PAC, also normally linear, said nose-down and nose-up portions being joined to each other at a neutral point N. Thus, for a variation of the nose-down deflection command 8m between 0 and a maximum value +8mmax (and conversely between +δqmax and 0) , the nose-down deflection of the elevators 8 varies between 0 and a maximum value +8qmax (and conversely between +8qmax and 0). Similarly, for a variation of the nose-up deflection command δq between 0 and a maximum value -δqmax (and conversely between -8mmax and 0), the nose-up deflection of the elevators 8 varies between 0 and a maximum value -δqmax (and conversely between -Sqmax and 0) . It is also known that, when the airplane 1 is taxiing on the ground S in the usual known situations represented in figures 2A and 2B, the deflection command 8m is zero (the elevators 8 are in aerodynamic extension of the horizontal stabilizer 6) such that the deflection angle δq is also zero: we are then therefore at the neutral point N of the characteristic 14, with a possible weak negative lift of value DPI due to the usual setting of the adjustable horizontal stabilizer 6.<br>
According to a significant feature of the present invention, to obtain a negative lift value DP2 greater than the value DPI, when the control column is in the neutral position, the characteristic 14 of figure 3 is modified for the deflection angle 6q to assume a nose-up value -δqo (able to generate the negative lift value DP2) when the deflection command δq is zero (see figures 4 and 5) .<br>
In the exemplary embodiment illustrated by figure 4, the characteristic 14 is modified to a characteristic 15 comprising a part 15A, for example stxaight, joining<br><br>
the point δq = 0r δq = -δqo to the point δq = -δq max, Sq = -δq max, and a part 15B, for example straight, joining the point δq = 0, δq = -δqo to the point δq = +δq max, δq = +6q max.<br>
As a variant, in the exemplary characteristic modification shown by figure 5, the characteristic 14 is modified to a characteristic 16 comprising an intermediate part 16B, for example straight, which passes through the point δm = 0, δq = -δqo and the ends of which are linked to the points δq = -δq max, δq = -δq max and δq = +δq max, δq = +δq max, respectively by end parts 16A and 16C, for example straight.<br>
It will easily be understood that the characteristics 15 and 16 of figures 4 and 5 are only examples with numerous other possibilities.<br>
Moreover, since, while the braking action B is being applied, the forward speed V of the airplane 1 on the ground S decreases, it follows that the lift value P decreases, so increasing the value of the forces Ftp and Fav and that, to obtain the same value Fav3 of the vertical force Fav on the front landing gear 12, the value DP2 of the negative lift DP must also decrease accordingly. The value DP2 must therefore decrease with the forward speed V of the airplane 1, such that the same applies for the absolute value δqo | of the deflection angle -Sqo generating the negative lift value DP2 when the deflection command δq is zero.<br>
Figure 6 represents the block diagram of a system for<br>
implementing  the  method  according  to  the  present<br>
invention. This system comprises:<br>
- a known device 17, generating the usual characteristic 14 (or any other similar characteristic) having a neutral point N, for which δq = 0 and δq = 0;<br><br>
a switching device 18 comprising a normally closed<br>
contact a to which said device 17 is linked via a<br>
gradient limiter (for example 20°/s)/ said switching<br>
device 18 comprising another normally open contact b<br>
and a common contact c linked to the control system<br>
of the elevators 8;<br>
a device 2 0 for generating a braking command for the<br>
wheels 11 of the main landing gear 10, said device 2 0<br>
controlling the switchover of the switching device 18<br>
from  its  unoperated  position  to  its  operated<br>
position, via a counter 21;<br>
means 22 for measuring the actual vertical force Fav<br>
exerted on the steerable front landing gear 12 while<br>
the airplane 1 is taxiing on the ground S, said means<br>
being,  for example,  of  force  sensor or pressure<br>
sensor type;<br>
memory means 23,  in which is stored the reference<br>
value Fav3 for said vertical force Fav;<br>
comparison  means  24  receiving  at  their  inputs,<br>
respectively the reference value Fav3 coming from the<br>
memory means 23 and the measurement of the vertical<br>
force Fav coming from the measurement means 22 via a<br>
filter 25;<br>
a  multiplier  26,  for multiplying  the  difference<br>
signal, derived from the comparison means 24, by a<br>
coefficient K, constant or dependent on the speed V,<br>
representative of the effectiveness of the elevators<br>
8 on the vertical force Fav exerted on the front<br>
landing gear 12;<br>
a computer 27, receiving the signal derived from the<br>
multiplier 26 and a signal representative of the<br>
instantaneous speed of the airplane 1 and generating<br>
the absolute value δqo|, decreasing with the speed<br>
V, capable of providing at each instant the negative<br>
lift DP2 required to obtain the desired force value<br>
on the front landing gear 12;<br>
a gradient limiter 28  (for example 5°/s) receiving<br>
said absolute value |δqo|; and<br><br>
- computation means 2 9 which, based on said absolute value δqo| received from the gradient limiter 2 8, determine the characteristic 15 or 16 (or any other similar characteristic) and transmit it to the normally open contact b of the switching device 18.<br>
Thus, when the airplane 1 is taxiing on the ground S without the brakes being applied, it is the characteristic 14 (or' any similar characteristic with neutral point N) that is available to control the elevators 8, via the subsystem 17, 19, a and c.<br>
Conversely, when a braking command generated by the device 20 is applied to the wheels 11 of the main landing gear 10 for a time predetermined by the counter 21, the latter switches over the switching device 18, so that the common contact c is then linked to the contact b. In this case, it is the characteristic 15 (or the characteristic 16 - or any other characteristic with a point §m = 0,δq = -8qo) that appears on the common contact c to control the elevators 8.<br>
When the braking command ceases, the switching device 18 switches back so as to once again link the contacts a and c and the characteristic 14 is again available on the common contact c. The gradient limiter 19 is used to eliminate the additional nose-up moment when the braking moment CB disappears.<br>
The system for improving the braking efficiency of an aircraft according to the present invention is not limited to the embodiment shown diagrammatically in figure 6 and given by way of example in order to clearly understand the invention. For example, the system of figure 6 could be modified for the device 17, generating the characteristic 14, and the computer 27, generating the characteristics 15 or 16, to have common parts.<br><br><br><br>
