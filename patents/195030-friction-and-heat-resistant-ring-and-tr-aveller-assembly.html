This invention relates to friction and heat resistant Ring and Traveller assembly for Ring Spinning machines.<br>
The Ring and Traveller assembly plays a unique role in imparting twist to the yarn during yarn manufacturing process by Ring Spinning machine. During the spinning process, the traveller is in constant contact with the inner lip of the ring and as the speed of operation increases, the area of contact of the traveller with the ring is also increased. This contact generates friction between two components which in turn generates heat, thus raising the temperature of both the ring and the traveller. Conventional traveller is an object of very light weight. For instance, a traveller used for producing forty count yarn weighs about 30 mg only. Consequently, the heat generated during spinning operations burns the traveller out and reduces its life. For example, in a 42 mm ring in which the traveller moves at 15000 rpm., the linear speed of the same is around 33 meters/sec. Enormous generation of heat which increases with increase in speeds, burns out the traveller frequently, thus resulting in stoppage of work for replacement and consequential production losses. Heat generated during operation adversely affects the ring also which reaches glass transition temperature quickly. Contact with the moving traveller at this stage leads to metal siezures or leaves permanent marks on the surface of the ring, resulting in material and production losses. It is obvious that to increase the performance and consequential production rate of ring and traveller assembly, one has to look for methods for reducing heat generation during operation. Surfaces of the ring and the traveller  must have sufficient hardness to avoid easy wear  and<br><br>
tear. At the same time the surfaces must be smooth and generate only the minimum possible friction during operation. This would ideally result in minimum temperature rise. By making the ring and traveller assembly more heat conductive, possible rise in temperature can be avoided or controlled.<br>
An object of this invention is to increase heat conduction of the active surface of the ring and traveller. Rings are made of iron lattices. The thermal conductivity and hardness of conventional rings may be increased considerably by diffusing a ferro magnetic material into the lattice and titanium atoms thereon. We have observed that surface coating with nickel and optionally titanium ions reduces friction and increases the hardness and conductivity of the assembly. Surfaces may be coated with nickel by electroless diffusion coating and titanium by plasma coating thereon. The thickness of the coating may range from 1 micron to 60 microns. Presence of ferromagnetic material and titanium on the surface improves heat conduction and the core carries it away such that the heat generated is dissipiated right at the source. Optionally friction between the components may be further reduced by coating the electroless nickel substrate with polytetra fluoro ethylene. The polymer used is upto 15% by weight of ferromagnetic coating material. For high speed operation a multi-layer coating is found more effective. In a trial, a coating of 20 micron thickness of diffused nickel or 2 micron thickness of titanium nitride showed 30% improvement in the performance rate.<br>
This invention relates to a friction and heat resistant ring and traveller assembly, wherein, the surfaces of the ring and the traveller  have  deposited  thereon  at  least  one  layer  of  a<br><br>
ferromagnetic material and/or titanium ions, the ferromagnetic layer optionally having polytetra fluoro ethylene to reduce friction and to increase the thermal conductivity.<br>
Coating may be effected by the preferred method of coating by diffusion. Diffusion deposition is carried out in any known manner. Nickel deposition is carried out in an aqueous solution containing nickel ions, reducing agents, complexants, pH regulators, accelerators, stabilizers buffers and wetting agents.<br>
Sources of nickel ions are nickel chloride, nickel sulphate or nickel acetate or a combination thereof. Preferably the solution may contain 14 to 45 gm per litre of nickel chloride, 1 to 45 gm per litre of nickel sulphate, and 60 to 75 gm per litre of nickel acetate.<br>
Reducing agents like sodium borohydride and hydrazine borne may be used in the range of 0.4 to 0.8 gm per litre and 0.5 to 1.5 gm per litre respectively.<br>
Mono and dicarboxylic acids, ammonia and alkyl amines are used as complexants which prevent precipitation of nickel and nickel phosphate. Anions of mono and di-carboxy1ic acids, ammonia and alkyl amines also accelerate the deposition.<br>
Ions of lead, tin, arsenic, molybdenum, cadmium or thallium and thio urea act as bath statbilizers during the diffusion process.<br><br>
spindle drive system of this invention consists of an AC inverter drive, one AC motor and DC Tacho generator. The AC motor is preferably mounted on a base which is pivotably mounted on the frame in the end stock. The DC tacho generator and its drive system is mounted either on the rear side of the AC motor, or near head stock on the main drive shaft of spindles. A flat belt driving system is provided for power transmission to the main drive shaft which in turn drives the four spindle belt drive system or the sectional tangential spindle drive system. The speed of the motor is controlled through infinite number of steps thus enabling higher productivity with lesser end breaks.<br>
The machine also has intelligent display system IDS which is a computer and programmable logic controllers (PLC) power fail control system, inverters and the like, electrical and electronic components to control the AC motor. PLCs, IDS and the like accessories are also provided which are mounted in the panel near the end stock.<br>
Advantages of this invention are improved automation and centralised control, smooth and efficient operation resulting  in<br><br>
deposition rate in acid bath ranges from 10 microns to 30 microns per hour.<br>
This invention is not limited to the specific values described hereinabove, which may be altered and modified in many ways by those skilled in the art without altering the inventive concept described in principle hereinabove and claimed hereinafter.<br><br><br>
