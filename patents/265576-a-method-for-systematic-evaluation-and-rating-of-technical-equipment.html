				<td>Method and system for systematic evaluation of evaluation<br>
parameters of technical equipment<br>
Description<br>
The present invention relates to a method and a system for<br>
systematic evaluation and rating of technical equipment,<br>
particularly power engineering equipment,.using demand-<br>
oriented data detection, which is specifically tailored to<br>
the particular equipment or the particular type of<br>
equipment, and/or a specific evaluation structure or a<br>
specific evaluation scheme.<br>
As is known from the article "Zustandsabhangige Bewertung-<br>
Neuer Ansatz zum Lebensdauermanagement fur elektrische<br>
Betriebsmittel [Status-Dependent Evaluation - Novel<br>
Approach for Service Life Management for Electrical<br>
Equipment]", published in the ABB Technik 4/2000 Journal,<br>
in practical application, two types of evaluation methods<br>
are primarily used for technical equipment, specifically:<br>
statistical methods and methods oriented individually to<br>
the individual equipment.  The statistical methods require<br>
reliable data, which may be statistically evaluated, in a<br>
sufficient quantity.  For this purpose, the technical<br>
equipment observed is to have a comparable structure and<br>
its breakdown mechanism is to be simple and well known.<br>
More complex equipment, such as power transformers,<br>
typically do not fulfill the above-mentioned requirement.<br>
Rather, in this case each unit is typically a unique item.<br>
In contrast, statistical methods require larger<br>
"populations", typically having equipment whose technical<br><br>
functional and structure are comparable.  Such methods are<br>
accordingly not suitable or are suitable in only a limited<br>
way for evaluating a single power transformer, for example.<br>
To achieve set strategic and operational goals, it is<br>
necessary to recognize the asset components and/or<br>
technical equipment which are most susceptible and to<br>
determine and/or select the particular optimal methods for<br>
replacement, maintenance, and/or operation of any of the<br>
equipment.  For this purpose, an individual approach, such<br>
as an evaluation method based on weighting factors or a<br>
modern evaluation method, is to be used.  Methods based on<br>
weighting factors may be used in the first phase of an<br>
equipment evaluation.  They are typically simple and rapid,<br>
but also subjective in regard to judgment, input data, and<br>
weighting factors.  The results therefore provide only a<br>
restricted physical and/or functional insight into a<br>
component of the equipment observed and may lead to mixing<br>
of different stresses and risks.  Modern evaluation methods<br>
may provide more objective information to support decisions<br>
about the unit observed, but they require knowledge of the<br>
history of the particular equipment and/or the particular<br>
unit, which is often known only in a restricted way.<br>
The structure of a corresponding typical evaluation scheme<br>
is flat, i.e., the particular output variable is determined<br>
directly starting from an array of inputs and/or input<br>
variables without hierarchical configuration.<br>
The present invention is based on the object of allowing a<br>
systematic evaluation and rating of equipment in the<br>
simplest possible way with the least possible outlay and<br>
avoiding the above-mentioned disadvantages.<br>
2<br><br>
The above-mentioned object is achieved by a method of the<br>
type cited at the beginning having the features of Claim 1.<br>
Further advantageous embodiments of the method according to<br>
the present invention and a system for its execution are<br>
specified in the subclaims and the following description.<br>
The method for systematic evaluation and rating of<br>
technical equipment, particularly power engineering<br>
equipment, allows, using demand-oriented data detection<br>
tailored to the particular equipment or the particular type<br>
of equipment and/or a specific evaluation structure or a<br>
specific evaluation scheme, determination of evaluation<br>
parameters, particularly the technical evaluation parameter<br>
RIx, relating to the technical status of the particular<br>
equipment, and the economic evaluation parameter FIx,<br>
relating to the economic significance of the particular<br>
technical equipment, and their facultative linkage into an<br>
overall evaluation parameter EIx.  In this case, firstly at<br>
least one first data set having economically relevant input<br>
parameters Fra and at least one second data set having<br>
technically relevant input parameters Rn are detected and/or<br>
established step-by-step.  For each data set, the<br>
established input parameters are combined and/or linked<br>
into an economic evaluation parameter FIx and a technical<br>
evaluation parameter RIx using knowledge-based<br>
predetermined numerical and/or logical linkages as well as<br>
knowledge-based predetermined weighting factors specific to<br>
the equipment.  Then, through knowledge-based predetermined<br>
numerical linkages and weighting factors, one single<br>
resulting overall evaluation parameter EIx is then<br>
determined from the evaluation parameters established.<br>
3<br><br>
To prepare for the method, specific input parameters Rn may<br>
detected and/or determined selectively for each item of<br>
equipment and/or each type of equipment.<br>
In this case, the predetermined input parameters Rn take<br>
into consideration the risk and/or the probability of<br>
possible malfunctions and/or fault modes arising as well as<br>
possible faulty behavior of the particular equipment<br>
resulting therefrom, which, for example, in transformers<br>
and their functional components, particularly tap changers<br>
or on-load switches such as DETCs (deenergized tap changer)<br>
or OLTCs (on-load tap changer) and/or generators and/or<br>
electrical drives, may be caused by faulty mechanical<br>
windings, faulty electrical insulation systems, faulty<br>
cores, faulty contacts and/or contact points, faulty<br>
cooling systems, faulty electrical and/or mechanical<br>
bushings, and faulty drives and/or gears.<br>
For each input parameter Rn of the particular equipment used<br>
as a basis, at least one definition and/or value range<br>
which is relevant to the equipment may be determined.  The<br>
definition and value ranges are to be determined in this<br>
case in such a way that a greater and/or higher value<br>
always corresponds to a high risk and/or a high probability<br>
for possible faulty behavior and/or a malfunction.<br>
The technical input parameters Rn to be detected or<br>
determined may not be specified in physical units in this<br>
case, but rather using a predetermined scaling specific for<br>
the particular equipment or on an arbitrary scale or<br>
4<br><br>
definition range, for example, on a scale from 0 to 100, 1<br>
to 5, or 20 to 80.<br>
A computer program for execution on an appropriately set-up<br>
data processing device, which has the features of the<br>
method according to the present invention, results in a<br>
preferred embodiment of the system according to the present<br>
invention.  A computer program, particularly a computer<br>
program stored on a data carrier, which has the features of<br>
the method according to the present invention, is therefore<br>
expressly included in the content of the disclosure of the<br>
present application.<br>
The system for systematic evaluation and rating of<br>
technical equipment has at least one data processing<br>
device, which works together with at least one data memory,<br>
the data processing device containing means for detecting<br>
and/or establishing at least one first data set having<br>
economically relevant input parameters and at least one<br>
second data set having technically relevant input<br>
parameters for the particular technical equipment, and for<br>
each data set, using knowledge-based predetermined<br>
numerical and/or logical linkages as well as knowledge-<br>
based predetermined weighting factors specific to the<br>
equipment, for bringing together the input parameters<br>
established into an economic evaluation parameter FIx and a<br>
technical evaluation parameter RIx, and for determining one<br>
single resulting overall evaluation parameter EIx for<br>
validating the particular technical equipment from the<br>
established evaluation parameters using knowledge-based<br>
predetermined numerical linkages and weighting factors.<br>
5<br><br>
The system-oriented and systematically structured procedure<br>
according to the method is performed in this case, using a<br>
data processing device set up for this purpose in<br>
particular, by providing and using at least one demand-<br>
oriented pre-configured and/or graphically structured work<br>
interface and/or work environment, which allows efficient<br>
and practical classification of the investigated equipment<br>
to be evaluated into different quality classes.  In this<br>
case, hierarchically constructed evaluation schemes are<br>
also advantageously usable.<br>
These and further advantageous embodiments and designs of<br>
the present invention are the object of the description of<br>
the figures and the dependent claims.<br>
The present invention and further advantageous embodiments<br>

Figure 1 shows an exemplary method sequence for the<br>
systematic evaluation and transmission of evaluation<br>
parameters of technical equipment, in which, for the most<br>
complete and comprehensive possible equipment status<br>
evaluation, both a technical evaluation parameter RIx,<br>
7<br><br>
relating to the technical status of the particular<br>
equipment, and an economic evaluation parameter FIx,<br>
relating to the economic significance of the particular<br>
technical equipment, are determined step-by-step.  An<br>
overall resulting evaluation parameter EIx is produced by<br>
linking the two above-mentioned evaluation parameters.<br>
For this purpose, at least one first data set having<br>
economically relevant input parameters F1...Fn and at least<br>
one second data set having technically relevant input<br>
parameters R1...Rn are first detected and/or established<br>
step-by-step for the particular technical equipment.<br>
To determine the technical evaluation parameter RIx,<br>
firstly, in a first step 1R, input characteristics<br>
corresponding to the predetermined relevant input<br>
parameters R1...Rn, such as estimations of the evaluator<br>
and/or user relating to the risk and/or the probability of<br>
a possible fault and/or breakdown, the quality, the<br>
capability, and/or the status of the particular technical<br>
equipment and/or one or more of its components, are<br>
detected and/or determined or assigned.  The detection may<br>
be performed automatically in this case, in combination<br>
with appropriately configured databanks and/or evaluation<br>
tools, for example.<br>
The input characteristics associated with the particular<br>
above-mentioned technical input parameters R1...Rn usually<br>
represent the best possible subjective estimation of the<br>
particular evaluator and/or user and are decisively based<br>
on his professional knowledge and/or experiences.<br>
8<br><br>
In addition, the above-mentioned technical input parameters<br>
R1...Rn may also, however, be output values of implemented<br>
upstream calculation and/or evaluation methods and/or<br>
tools, as shown in Figure 1, which, for example, are<br>
obtained through a preprocessing VR of available technical<br>
equipment data and/or parameters rii...rn, r2i-..r2i ...<br>
rni-».rni, particularly data of sensor and/or monitoring<br>
systems and/or diagnostic data, such as data relating to<br>
the load of a transformer and/or generator, oil fill levels<br>
and/or temperature, mechanically acting forces and/or gas<br>
formation.  These values are then introduced into the<br>
method and/or transferred to the system as technical input<br>
data, if necessary using appropriately pre-configured<br>
interfaces for data detection and/or transmission, for<br>
example, via a local area network (LAN) and/or a world area<br>
network (WAN), particularly the Internet or a radio<br>
network, or as accessible on a data storage, preferably in<br>
a data bank or stored data set.<br>
Manual detection of the different input variables rn-.-rn,<br>
r2i.-.r2i ... rni...rni and/or input parameters R1...Rn by the<br>
particular user is also possible.<br>
The input parameters R1...Rn, and accordingly their<br>
associated input characteristics, are weighted and/or<br>
scaled to determine the technical evaluation parameter RIx<br>
in a second step 2R using knowledge-based pre-determined,<br>
i.e., pre-determined based on empirical data and/or<br>
experiential values and/or technical considerations,<br>
individual technical weighting factors wti...wtn, and<br>
resulting scaled intermediate variables SRi...SRn are<br>
produced using associated scaled intermediate data.<br>
9<br><br>
Through the individual different weightings wta..-wtn of the<br>
different input parameters R1...Rn, among other things, the<br>
dangers and/or technical consequences associated with the<br>
particular fault mode of the technical equipment are taken<br>
into consideration, particularly if multiple equipments are<br>
coupled and/or operated in an interconnection.<br>
The definition and/or value ranges of the particular input<br>
parameters R1...Rn are to be taken into consideration when<br>
the different technical weighting factors wtn are<br>
determined.<br>
The scaled intermediate variables SRi...SRn and the<br>
associated scaled intermediate data are linked and/or<br>
brought together automatically into the evaluation<br>
parameter RIx in a third step 3R as a function of<br>
preference using numerical and/or logical linkages 4R and<br>
further weighting factors wi...wn specific to the equipment.<br>
The preference allocation and/or definition may be<br>
performed in this case, for example, on the part of the<br>
expert evaluator and/or user or device owner and/or<br>
knowledge-based, i.e., based on empirical data and/or<br>
experiential values as well as technical considerations.<br>
The preference allocation may advantageously be performed<br>
as a preparation for the method and/or during the running<br>
method.  Preference changes are also possible in principle<br>
at any time.<br>
The weighting factors wi...wn specific to the equipment of<br>
the different scaled intermediate variables SRi...SRn used<br>
10<br><br>
for the preference allocation usually differ, but may in<br>
principle also have equal values.<br>
The technical evaluation parameter RIx is determined on the<br>
basis of the scaled intermediate variables SRi...SRn,<br>
different logical/numerical linkage rules 4R being<br>
facultatively selectable as needed.  The selection may be<br>
performed in this case as a preparation for the method<br>
and/or during the running method.<br>
The determination of the technical evaluation parameter RIx<br>
from the scaled intermediate variables SRi...SRn may be<br>
performed in this case, for example, by calculating a<br>
weighted sum using RIx = (L(wn *SRn))*const , a weighted product<br>
RIx = (n(5H*-))*const , or a freely designable numerical and/or<br>
logical linkage rule H of the general form<br>
RIx = H(SRl,SR2,..SRn,wi,w2,...wn) using the weighting factors<br>
wi. ..wn.<br>
Processing of fuzzy input parameters using fuzzy logic<br>
rules and/or methods and/or probabilistic methods is also<br>
advantageously possible.<br>
A preprocessing preliminary stage, which, at least<br>
partially through interpolation and/or estimation methods,<br>
allows a value determination of the input parameters on the<br>
basis of multiple preliminary stage values, may<br>
advantageously be placed upstream for an objective<br>
estimation of the input parameters R1-.. Rn-<br>
11<br><br>
Determination of the above-mentioned input parameters<br>
R1...Rn may generally be performed, as shown in Figure 1,<br>
through at least one linkage rule Pn, which is empirically<br>
determined and/or follows technical considerations,<br>
generally expressible through Rn = Pm(rnl,rll2,rll3...rlli) r using the<br>
input variables rn...rii, r2i...r2i ... rni. .. rni- and/or their<br>
associated technical equipment data and/or parameters.<br>
Preferably, three processing values rni...rn3 are to be used<br>
in the pre-processing VR for each input parameter R1...Rn to<br>
be determined.  These may relate, for example, to design<br>
and/or manufacture rni, aging rn2, and observed and/or<br>
measured data rn3 of the particular technical equipment to<br>
be evaluated.  The number and type of the values taken into<br>
consideration in the preliminary stage and therefore the<br>
running index i may be freely selected and/or preset and<br>
are not limited.  The number of values to be taken into<br>
consideration for determining the different input<br>
parameters R1...Rn may vary depending on the input parameter<br>
and/or from input parameter to input parameter.<br>
A consistency check may advantageously be performed, which,<br>
for example, allows checking of the data inventory<br>
available to determine an input parameter R1...Rn.  If the<br>
existing data inventory is insufficient to determine the<br>
value of one or more input parameters R1...Rn, the<br>
corresponding input parameter may be approximately<br>
facultatively determined on the basis of the existing data<br>
inventory or may be removed from the determination of the<br>
technical evaluation parameter RIx or may be specified<br>
manually.<br>
12<br><br>
A consistency check in regard to whether concrete values<br>
and/or data for the particular weighting factors and/or<br>
input parameters are specified and/or detected in<br>
principle, and whether the detected statements correspond<br>
to the predetermined definition and/or value ranges, may<br>
also be performed according to the method.<br>
To determine the economic evaluation parameter FIx, which<br>
describes the economic significance of the technical<br>
equipment, in a further step IF at least one second data<br>
set having economically relevant input parameters F1..-Fm is<br>
determined.  The input data of the economically relevant<br>
input parameters F1...Fm required for determining the<br>
economic evaluation parameter FIx of the particular<br>
technical equipment, particularly power engineering<br>
equipment, may be estimated in this case based on<br>
experiential values and/or technical/business<br>
considerations and/or determined using a further upstream<br>
preliminary stage processing VF, comparably to the<br>
technical input parameters R1-..Rn for determining the<br>
technical evaluation parameter RIx.<br>
The preliminary stage processing VF may be hierarchically<br>
configured in multiple levels in this case, so that a level<br>
and/or a set of input values for the pre-processing VF is<br>
usable for each economically relevant input parameter<br>
F1...Fm.<br>
An economically relevant and/or pecuniary input parameter<br>
F1...Fm may generally be produced in this case from<br>
numerical values f n. . . fig f2i-• • f2q •-• fmi--»fmq/ relating,<br>
13<br><br>
for example, to acquisition costs, maintenance costs,<br>
profits obtained, transport costs, installation costs,<br>
costs per time unit in case of equipment breakdown, storage<br>
costs and/or acquisition costs for raw, auxiliary, and<br>
operating materials, costs caused by losses occurring in<br>
the equipment, recovery costs, costs for energy not<br>
provided, or any arbitrary combination of these or similar<br>
cost factors, through at least one numerical and/or logical<br>
linkage rule Gm of the general formula Fm=Gm(fml,fml,...fmq),<br>
determined on the basis of empirical data and/or<br>
business/technical considerations, using the numerical<br>
Values    fn. . . fiq  f2i. . • f2q       •••     f ml - - - f mq-<br>
Manual detection of the different input variables and/or<br>
input parameters by the particular user is also possible.<br>
The level of the costs relevant for the parameter<br>
determination is essentially a function in this case of the<br>
particular technical equipment and/or its position and/or<br>
significance, particularly in the particular equipment<br>
interconnection.  A first, approximate estimation of the<br>
values of the economic, particularly pecuniary input<br>
parameters F1...Fm may also be performed in this case by the<br>
evaluator and/or user.<br>
The total costs TF established in a further step 2F from<br>
the pecuniary input parameters F1...Fm and/or their input<br>
characteristics through numerical linkages 3F are<br>
proportional to the economic evaluation parameter FIx.  To<br>
determine the economic evaluation parameter FIx, the<br>
established total costs TF are scaled in a further step 4F<br>
14<br><br>
on a predetermined scale and/or a predetermined value<br>
range, from 0-100, for example.  The economic evaluation<br>
parameter FIx is specified accordingly.  If necessary, the<br>
total costs TF may also be established by an upstream,<br>
separate processing tool and/or detected manually by the<br>
particular user.<br>
Incorporating further weighting factors wr and wf and/or a<br>
linkage 6, in a further step 5, the technical evaluation<br>
parameter RIx and the economic evaluation parameter FIx are<br>
brought together and an overall evaluation parameter EIx is<br>
determined as a result.<br>
The determination of the overall parameter EIx may be<br>
performed facultatively by determining the weighted<br>
Euclidean distance according to the linkage rule<br>
EIx = ^j{(wr *RIx)2 +(wf*FIx)2) , wr and wf identifying the<br>
particular weightings of the technical evaluation parameter<br>
RIx and the economic parameter FIx.  For the case in which<br>
the two above-mentioned weighting factors wr and wf<br>
correspond to the value one, i.e., wr = wf = 1, the<br>
Euclidean distance in 2-dimensional space results.  A<br>
weighted sum of the economic evaluation parameter FIx and<br>
the technical evaluation parameter RIx, incorporating a<br>
factor k used for scaling, according to the linkage rule<br>
EIx = (w *RIx + w *FLc)*k<br>
v r      f      i may also be used as the facultative<br>
linkage rule for determining the overall evaluation<br>
parameter EIx.  A determination of the weighted product of<br>
the economic evaluation parameter FIx and the technical<br>
evaluation parameter RIx according to the linkage rule<br>
EIx = (RIxwr *FIxwf)*l is also facultatively possible as a<br>
15<br><br>
further alternative linkage rule, the weightings and/or<br>
weighting factors wr and wf each being used as the exponent<br>
of the corresponding parameter.  In this case as well, I<br>
again identifies a factor for scaling the overall<br>
evaluation parameter EIx.<br>
In principle, any numerical and/or logical linkage rule Q<br>
of the general form EIx = Q(RIx,FIx) which may be arbitrarily<br>
preselected may be used for determining the overall<br>
evaluation parameter EIx.<br>
The established parameters and/or the input variables and<br>
data upon which they are based are automatically displayed<br>
7 in tabular and/or graphic form, for example, as a<br>
histogram or as a tree structure (cf. Figure 2), and if<br>
necessary they are automatically stored 8 on a data memory<br>
and/or in a data bank.<br>
The established parameters and/or input variables and their<br>
associated data are advantageously prepared in tabular form<br>
in a further step 9 and attached, via an interface<br>
specially set up for this purpose, which works together<br>
with the particular e-mail program or the particular e-mail<br>
client used, as an attachment 10 of an automatically<br>
prepared e-mail file provided according to the method with<br>
a unique identifier and retrievably stored on a data<br>
memory.  The e-mail prepared in this way and the included<br>
data attachment 10 are accordingly transmittable by e-mail<br>
to one or arbitrarily many addresses worldwide in a simple<br>
way using a network and/or e-mail server connection.<br>
16<br><br>
In Figure 2, an exemplary system for the systematic<br>
evaluation of evaluation parameters of technical equipment<br>
using a data processing device 20, which works together<br>
with a data memory 21 and has an input 22 and display<br>
device 23, is shown.<br>
The system, particularly the data processing device 20, has<br>
means 20a for detecting and/or establishing at least one<br>
first data set having economically relevant input<br>
parameters F1...Fm and at least one second data set having<br>
technically relevant R1...Rm input parameters for the<br>
particular technical equipment to be evaluated.  For each<br>
data set, the system automatically determines, on the basis<br>
of knowledge-based predetermined numerical and/or logical<br>
linkages and knowledge-based predetermined weighting<br>
factors specific to the equipment, both an economic<br>
evaluation parameter FIx and a technical evaluation<br>
parameter RIx.  One single overall evaluation parameter EIx<br>
is determined by the system resulting from the established<br>
evaluation parameters through knowledge-based predetermined<br>
numerical linkages 6 (cf. Figure 1) and weighting factors.<br>
The established parameters and/or the input variables and<br>
data upon which they are based are displayed by the system<br>
in tabular form 24 and/or graphic form, as a histogram 25<br>
or a tree structure, for example, and are provided<br>
retrievably and possibly stored retrievably on a data<br>
memory 21 and/or in a data bank.<br>
The system advantageously has an interface 26, which is.set<br>
up for the purpose of working together with a typical e-<br>
mail program or e-mail client and preparing the established<br>
parameters and/or input variables and their associated data<br>
17<br><br>
in tabular form and attaching them as an attachment 10 to<br>
an automatically prepared e-mail file provided with a<br>
unique identifier and storing the e-mail file retrievably<br>
on a data memory 21, for example, and/or transmitting it to<br>
one or more addresses and/or further data processing<br>
devices 28.  For this purpose, the identifier may contain<br>
specific information about the particular evaluated<br>
equipment, data information, or information relating to the<br>
author and/or the time of day.<br>
The system provides an evaluation mask, using which the<br>
data of the different input variables and/or input<br>
parameters is selectively detected and shown in graphic<br>
form.  For better understanding, a schematic method scheme<br>
28 used as the basis is shown.<br>
To predetermine weighting factors and/or preferences and/or<br>
input variables to be used for parameter determination<br>
and/or linkage rules, for example, appropriate input 27<br>
and/or selection masks having optionally selectable<br>
selection possibilities are provided by the system.<br>
Equipment data and/or equipment status data previously<br>
stored in a data bank may also be used by the system in<br>
combination with a data bank to evaluate technical<br>
equipment.  This is particularly true for default values<br>
which are stored in the data bank and are typical for a<br>
specific type of equipment.<br>
In order to give an example of the method according to the<br>
present invention and/or the system according to the<br>
present invention for systematic evaluation and rating of<br>
18<br><br>
technical equipment/ an example of the development of such<br>
a method for transformers is to be specified in the<br>
following.<br>
The risk/service life judgment of transformers has been the<br>
subject of much attention in recent years, because of the<br>
aging transformer fleet in industry and the failure of<br>
important assets because of transformer breakdowns.  A<br>
decade of application and development of service life<br>
judgment and risk management technology for large power<br>
transformers has resulted in a unit-based method having the<br>
following components:<br>
Screening the breakdown risk of large transformer<br>
populations to identify critical assets.<br>
Detailed design evaluation of the critical<br>
transformers using current design practices and tools.<br>
These include the current hotspot temperatures and the<br>
actual service life loss, the short-circuit strength<br>
and the risk of future breakdowns in connection with<br>
known design problems (flow electrification, winding<br>
kinks, partial discharge, circular currents, core<br>
heating, etc.).<br>
Status evaluation using the results of routine and<br>
advanced diagnostics and correlation with the design<br>
evaluation.<br>
Service life judgment (profiling) incorporating all<br>
critical aspects having effects on the transformer<br>
output.<br>
Recommending the most attractive option for service<br>
life extension.<br>
19<br><br>
In the following, the evaluation and application of this<br>
process will be described for a number of different<br>
segments of the transformer population of power suppliers.<br>
A good approach is based on being tailored to the special<br>
transformer population and the transformers used in<br>
application.  The examples shown confirm the great<br>
importance of design analysis and the experience of the<br>
manufacturer with the special design for an accurate<br>
service life judgment.  The application of these important<br>
technologies shows how future-oriented supply firms prepare<br>
for an uncertain future.<br>
A service life judgment method according to the present<br>
invention has its beginnings in the need to become better<br>
acquainted with the diagnosis and judgment of the status of<br>
different transformers.  Detailed historical knowledge of<br>
the transformer design of nearly 75% of the installed large<br>
assets in North America is available as the basic data.  In<br>
addition, there is the knowledge of repair shops, in which<br>
numerous broken transformers have been seen and which have<br>
decades-long experience in the forensic analysis of<br>
transformer components.<br>
The service life judgment is an important sector of<br>
transformer diagnostics.  This service life judgment<br>
approach was focused on the capability or the ability of<br>
individual transformers in the network to produce the<br>
desired output.  The transformers were individually<br>
analyzed, in an evaluation based on fuzzy logic, for<br>
technical (design data, diagnosis test data, etc.) and non-<br>
technical (application, importance, replacement<br>
transformers, etc.) aspects.  The net result resulted in a<br>
20<br><br>
ranked list of the different transformers for identifying<br>
the most critical transformers for follow-up maintenance<br>
and repair work or, in the extreme case, replacement.<br>
Service life judgments were performed for the following<br>
reasons:<br>
(1)	reliability considerations in regard to older assets;<br>
(2)	planning of replacement and repair;<br>
(3)	service life extension/increase of the power capacity;<br>
(4)	improved maintenance, and<br>
(5)	better asset usage.<br>
The results of the service life judgments of the large<br>
number of transformers - for example, those which have been<br>
identified in the fleet risk evaluation process - are<br>
generally used in the course of an RCM program (reliability<br>
centered asset management) in order to be able to order<br>
resource allocations by priority.  If small groups or only<br>
single transformers participate, the service life judgment<br>
is understood as a part of the decision process for service<br>
life extension, repair, or replacement.<br>
The majority of the service life judgments actually<br>
performed occur in regard to machine transformers, which<br>
may be attributed to the value and the breakdown costs of<br>
these important assets.  As in any technology in<br>
development, the detail and complexity of the analysis has<br>
increased in the course of time and with the experience<br>
obtained.  The requirements of the generation firms have<br>
also changed with the development of the new generation of<br>
power companies.  Instead of the traditional power<br>
companies having a mixture of power generation,<br>
21<br><br>
transmission, and distributor assets, there are currently<br>
la-rge power firms which have a mixture of power generation<br>
assets in different parts of the country.  The power<br>
generation assets are no longer connected to the<br>
traditional suppliers and the service organizations of the<br>
original owners-  The new power firms have a mixture of<br>
diverse transformers which are scattered over the country.<br>
In the majority of cases, the personnel having<br>
responsibility for asset management do not have the<br>
necessary historical knowledge of the transformers or their<br>
status.  In consideration of an aging population of<br>
transformers {average age -33 years) with unknown life<br>
expectancies, the firms have been searching for a solid<br>
technical basis for asset planning decisions.<br>
The answer was a three-stage process, including:<br>
(1}  risk evaluation of the transformer fleet,<br>
(2)	rigorous, unit-based design evaluation including<br>
status judgment, and<br>
(3)	detailed service life judgment including design /<br>
engineering analysis of the means for service life<br>
extension of each specific transformer (see Figure 3).<br>
Checking the transformer fleet<br>
The fleet risk evaluation method is the first step and/or a<br>
precursor step in the service life management process.  The<br>
method is used for the purpose of exploring the easily<br>
available analytical data and statistical information about<br>
each transformer of the fleet, so that precise and<br>
intelligent measure plans in regard to the future of<br>
individual transformers and the entire fleet may be<br>
22<br><br>
prepared.  The goal is the ordering by priority of measure<br>
plans for the transformers and the fleet and the<br>
identification of those transformers which are candidates<br>
for more detailed design, status, and service life<br>
judgments.<br>
This analysis includes both the calculation of the<br>
breakdown risk of the individual transformers and an<br>
evaluation of the relative importance of the individual<br>
transformers.  The calculation of the breakdown risk was<br>
developed on the basis of a statistical analysis of<br>
transformer breakdown data as a function of a number of<br>
transformer power and design parameters and known generic<br>
design weak points in regard to older design generations.<br>
This data was collected using historical records about<br>
specific transformers and published data about breakdown<br>
statistics.  The relative importance of a transformer takes<br>
the economic effects of an operational breakdown of the<br>
relevant asset into consideration.  The importance may be<br>
established in different ways.  One possible approach,<br>
however, contains parameters such as the replacement costs<br>
of the transformer, the lost sales connected with a<br>
failure, and the availability losses occurring in case of<br>
breakdown, as well as relative cost breakdowns and time<br>
problems.  The parameters of such an evaluation are<br>
typically established by a team which is composed of<br>
technicians from the user and the transformer manufacturer.<br>
After the breakdown risk and the relative importance of<br>
each individual transformer in the fleet have been<br>
established, a combined measure graphic is prepared, as is<br>
illustrated in Figure 4, for example.  This example relates<br>
to a large transformer fleet in a power generation system<br>
23<br><br>
and includes all transformers in the individual power<br>
plants.<br>
Design and status evaluation of transformers<br>
The design evaluation and status evaluation method for<br>
transformers is a significant step for the service life<br>
judgment and the asset management of transformers.  It is a<br>
very technical procedure and requires the most modern,<br>
rigorous analysis methods and rules, which are currently<br>
typical for design, test, and quality assurance tools used<br>
by design engineers in the design and manufacture of core-<br>
type and housing-type transformers.<br>
The method approach for the service life judgment is based<br>
on units and designs.  This means that the methods and<br>
analysis tools focus on the individual transformer, the<br>
type, the type of use, the application, and the needs of<br>
the supplier and/or operator.  However, the approach is<br>
also status-based, i.e., it contains different diagnostic<br>
and historical measurement data of the transformer status.<br>
The status-based data is analyzed in awareness of the<br>
individual design and the type, so that known generic or<br>
endemic characteristics may be identified and categorized.<br>
The status evaluation is also performed with reference to<br>
the results ol the detailed design study.<br>
Detailed design evaluation<br>
The design or engineering analysis of older transformers is<br>
a very important part of the service life judgment.  After<br>
the performance of service life judgments or design studies<br>
24<br><br>
on hundreds of different transformers having numerous<br>
different design forms, it is clear that the specified<br>
rated values of a transformer do not necessarily correspond<br>
to its actual capacities or power limits in practice.<br>
Transformer design engineers did not have the same<br>
instruments available in the past as they do today.  Often,<br>
slide rule calculations and general diagrams or rules were<br>
used instead of the well thought-out, computer-based design<br>
programs which are typical today.  The practices, rules,<br>
and limits of designs were also significantly improved in<br>
the course of time and/or reintroduced with increased<br>
knowledge and experience.  In addition, since the time of<br>
the design of a transformer, transformer problems typical<br>
to the time were often recognized and the design practices<br>
were subsequently changed in such a way that these problems<br>
could be corrected.  As a result, a design/engineering<br>
analysis reveals a lot about the transformer - why it has<br>
functioned in such a way, how it has functioned, and which<br>
changes may be necessary for performance improvement or a<br>
load increase or for other applications.  Although, for<br>
example, the current standard requirements limit the<br>
hotspot excess temperatures to 80°C, the design analyses of<br>
older transformers have shown that the actual calculated<br>
hotspot temperatures on 15 to 40-year-old transformers lie<br>
anywhere between 60°C and over 170°C (Figure 6).  Only in<br>
few cases does the hotspot measuring device indicate the<br>
correct hotspot temperature.  We may state that they<br>
typically lie slightly above the average winding<br>
temperature.  In consideration of this uncertainty, it is<br>
nearly impossible to determine the actual loss of service<br>
life or the load and/or overload capacity of an older<br>
25<br><br>
transformer without a design study.  It does appear<br>
advisable to react with additional cooling in such cases,<br>
but this may also bring risks with it or not appear<br>
economically advisable in relation to the advantage<br>
achieved.  Transformers having pumps may have oil flow-<br>
through rates which are already over the design limits,<br>
because of which the addition of further cooling could lead<br>
to failure because of flow electrification.<br>
This is also true for the mechanical design of older<br>
transformers.  While some older embodiments are very robust<br>
and capable of surviving the gravest fault conditions in<br>
the power system, others are in turn subject to significant<br>
restrictions in managing serious circumstances, since less<br>
precise calculations and limits of the short-circuit<br>
strength were used in the design of these transformers.  An<br>
analysis of these older designs is of great value for<br>
determining the risk of future operation and the need for<br>
replacement parts.  A further example of the currently<br>
available new calculation methods, which were not available<br>
a few years ago, is the calculations of winding circular<br>
current and core current in core-type and housing-type<br>
transformers.  3-D calculations currently offer new,<br>
valuable information about the design and a significantly<br>
higher precision of the design evaluation of older design<br>
types, particularly of housing-type transformers.<br>
The detailed design evaluation of the transformer for the<br>
service life judgment makes use of the newest design<br>
programs and design practices of the transformer<br>
manufacturers.  These include, for each design:<br>
26<br><br>
1.	An evaluation of the electrical and thermal output of<br>
the transformer, including:<br>
a)	ohmic and eddy current losses of the winding,<br>
circular current/losses, overall winding loss<br>
density distribution, and the actual localized<br>
hotspot temperature,<br>
b)	calculation of the core loss density distribution<br>
and core hotspot temperature, and<br>
c)	strength of the core currents,<br>
d)	sufficient magnetic or power shielding to prevent<br>
local tank or support structure heating over<br>
acceptable limiting values,<br>
e)	calculation of dielectric loads and strengths in<br>
the windings and in the connector and conductor<br>
structure.<br><br>
2.	An evaluation of the mechanical design to determine<br>
whether the transformer is susceptible to short-circuit<br>
breakdowns because of system errors.  During the<br>
performance of the mechanical design check, the internal<br>
loads in the winding and in the insulation and metal<br>
support structure are determined, for which calculated<br>
maximum asymmetric short-circuit forces in the windings as<br>
a result of all types of fault on the high-voltage (HV) or<br>
low-voltage side (LV) are used.  These load values are then<br>
compared to the calculated strengths of the windings (down<br>
to the individual conductor level) and the support<br>
structure.<br>
3.	A design evaluation of other known causes of breakdowns<br>
or field problems typical for other transformers of the<br>
same type.<br>
27<br><br>
Figure 5 shows the results of the mechanical design study<br>
for typical group of older transformers, illustrating the<br>
results of the short-circuit design study.<br>
This type of information is extremely useful for clarifying<br>
the field history of the transformers and for asset<br>
management (replacement parts usage, identification of<br>
critical units, etc.).<br>
Status evaluation<br>
The purpose of status evaluation is the evaluation of the<br>
probable status of the internal and external parts of the<br>
transformer.  The internal evaluation includes the<br>
insulation system (paper, pressboard, oil, etc.), the core,<br>
mechanical support structures, and internal auxiliary<br>
devices such as tap changers and auxiliary transformers or<br>
reactors.  The external asset includes the tank, the<br>
cooling system, the controllers, oil conservation systems,<br>
bushings, and integrated protective systems.  The<br>
evaluation combines inputs from the design evaluation with<br>
historical load and operational data as well as routine and<br>
advanced diagnostic data.<br>
An important part of Lhe status evaluation is the<br>
evaluation of the winding insulation and the estimated<br>
remaining service life of the paper insulation.  The study<br>
uses historical transformer load data with a thermal<br>
simulation of the transformer windings and the cooling<br>
system.  Using these inputs, the cumulative effect of the<br>
transformer hotspot temperatures on the paper insulation<br>
28<br><br>
may be evaluated.  The key to the approach according to the<br>
present invention is the design analysis for determining<br>
the hotspot excess temperature for the transformer.  Figure<br>
6 shows a statistical diagram of the hotspot excess<br>
temperature at rated MVA for 80 different network<br>
transformers and power plant transformers (machine<br>
transformers, auxiliary units, etc.), which were produced<br>
between 1960 and 1992.  Even if these transformers were<br>
designed while observing the 80 degree limit, the design<br>
analysis using our modern design tools shows that seventy<br>
percent of the transformers have an actual hotspot excess<br>
temperature which is above the current ANSI limiting value<br>
of 80°C.  Actually, in all 70% of the cases over the 80<br>
degree limit and in some of the 30 cases under the limit,<br>
the actual hotspot excess temperature is higher than the<br>
value indicated on the hotspot excess temperature display<br>
device of the transformer windings.<br>
Without this design analysis, it would be impossible to<br>
evaluate the load on the transformer or estimate the<br>
service life loss of the insulation.  This is because a 7°C<br>
excess temperature in the assumed hotspot temperature means<br>
doubling of the prognosticated insulation aging.<br>
A further interesting observation for the transformer<br>
population-in Figure 6 is the fact that, in spite of a<br>
hotspot excess temperature well over the ANSI limiting<br>
value in many transformers, only a few of the 80<br>
transformers have a loss of insulation service life of more<br>
than 100%.  This was to be attributed to the fact that most<br>
of these transformers were never loaded to the specified<br>
maximum rated value.<br>
29<br><br>
The status evaluation typically also includes an on-<br>
location inspection and an evaluation of the historical<br>
(routine) diagnostic data and maintenance information and<br>
the advanced diagnostic measurements.  This routine<br>
diagnostic data includes a DGA (analysis of dissolved<br>
combustible gas in the oil) and an oil chemistry analysis,<br>
as well as electrical test data including the results of<br>
winding and bushing power factor tests.  For this purpose,<br>
specialized diagnostic test analysis tools were developed<br>
for evaluating DGA and oil quality results.<br>
Advanced diagnostic tests also play an important role in<br>
the status evaluation.  The DFR test (dielectric frequency<br>
response) was developed into an important tool for status<br>
diagnosis of the insulation system.  This test was used for<br>
the purpose of identifying the exact moisture content in<br>
the cellulose insulation in order to support decisions in<br>
regard to field drying requirements and to provide inputs<br>
for the evaluation of the insulation service life.  In<br>
addition, new advances in the DFR methodology were used for<br>
the purpose of identifying specific problems in the<br>
transformer, including metal particle contaminations,<br>
contaminations with corrosive sulfur, carbon cracking, and<br>
high-ohmic core-grounding connections.  Other advanced<br>
■diagnostic tests, including the furan analysis of Lhe oil,<br>
FRA (frequency response analysis), and partial discharge<br>
analysis, are also used as needed for specific cases.<br>
Service life judgment / profiling<br>
30<br><br>
The design analysis often clarifies the pattern of<br>
diagnostic data (DGA, electrical test results, etc.) and<br>
helps in the identification of important fields in which<br>
changes may be undertaken to extend the transformer life.<br>
These could include modifications of the cooling system<br>
(pump or cooler upgrades, etc.) or modifications of<br>
fittings (oil conservation system, bushings, controllers,<br>
etc.).  In addition, the study provides an estimation of<br>
the remaining service life of the transformers, so that the<br>
user may plan for future investment needs.<br>
A further object of the service life judgment is a ranked<br>
rating by units, in which the breakdown risk is described<br>
on the basis of results of the design and status<br>
evaluation.  This is a more detailed and precise breakdown<br>
risk judgment than in a fleet risk evaluation, especially<br>
since it is based on the specific knowledge of the<br>
transformer design and the actual status and additionally<br>
uses the statistical and historical parameters in<br>
connection with the fleet risk evaluation.  The resulting<br>
rating provides a precise evaluation of the breakdown risk<br>
of the transformer, which may be compared to the expected<br>
breakdown risk of other transformers in the industry.<br>
A typical example of the results of a service life judgment<br>
profiling is shown in Figure 7, which includes a comparison<br>
to a population of other critical transformers in industry.<br>
We understand critical transformer populations as<br>
transformers like those in the red or yellow zone of Figure<br>
4.  On the basis of this profiling, the supplier may make<br>
service life management decisions which are based on the<br>
relative breakdown risk for the transformers and the<br>
31<br><br>
comparison with other critical units in the industry.  If<br>
the risk is higher than the average of the critical<br>
population, it is clear that immediate measures must be<br>
taken to prevent inappropriate breakdowns or service<br>
losses.<br>
In order to manage specific problems which were recognized<br>
in the service life judgment study, or if significant<br>
changes in the load or application of the transformer have<br>
been considered, engineering-based solutions are necessary.<br>
After the performance of service life judgments or design<br>
studies on hundreds of different transformers having<br>
multiple different designs, it is clear that the rated<br>
values alone do not necessarily correspond to the actual<br>
capacities or restrictions of the transformers in<br>
operation.  For this reason, a design-tailored solution is<br>
necessary in order to be able to give adequate<br>
recommendations for service life extensions or other<br>
changes in the service situations.  In addition, the<br>
effects of aging processes on the transformers (according<br>
to the insights of the status evaluation) may restrict the<br>
future use of the transformer or potential upgrades.<br>
The advantages of the multiphase transformer risk/service<br>
life judgment process and how this process had developed<br>
from a rating method into a 'chssign and unit-based method,<br>
in which the specific knowledge of the transformer design,<br>
in combination with advanced diagnostic methods and<br>
experience-based status evaluations, are in the foreground,<br>
were described above.  The access to data on thousands of<br>
transformer designs and the implementation of the newest<br>
computer-based design programs are, among other things,<br>
32<br><br>
decisive for this improved process.  The value of these<br>
methods for the user has been shown and provided the user<br>
numerous and above all economically important foundations<br>
for asset management decisions in the application of these<br>
technologies to hundreds of older transformers in the North<br>
American and worldwide power systems.  Without the<br>
advantage of this status evaluation on the basis of design<br>
knowledge, erroneous estimations of remaining transformer<br>
lifetimes or breakdown risks could occur.  With increasing<br>
average age of the transformers, this approach will only<br>
become more important and more critical.<br>
On Figure 8 in detail:<br>
BIL factor means: transformers having a BIL {basic<br>
insulation level) below the normal design level have a<br>
higher breakdown risk because of the shorter insulation<br>
path.<br>
RP factor means: the RP or "reclosing practice" relates to<br>
the practice of the asset of reclosing power'switches which<br>
supply the transformers in the case in which the feed line<br>
turns off.  Since reclosing may cause an asymmetrical<br>
through fault current in a fault status, this practice<br>
increases the breakdown risk.  If multiple auto-reclosing<br>
is practiced, this- additionally increases the breakdown<br>
risk because the transformer is subjected to further<br>
through faults.<br>
SQRT MVA factor means: this factor is the square root of<br>
the MVA factor.  The MVA factor is the output of an<br>
algorithm which was developed in order to relate the<br>
33<br><br>
average breakdown risk to the size or the MVA of the<br>
transformer.  This algorithm was developed on the. basis of<br>
historical records of transformer breakdowns, which also<br>
took the MVA of the transformer into consideration.<br>
TF/Y factor means: the number of significant through faults<br>
which the transformer experiences per year.  We understand<br>
a significant through fault as one that produces a current<br>
to the transformer which corresponds to more than four<br>
times the peak rated current of the transformer.  If there<br>
is no data available or if the number of through faults per<br>
year is less than 2.5, a malfunction value of 2.5 is set.<br>
SQRT aging factor means: this is the square root of the<br>
aging factor.  We understand the aging factor as the<br>
average breakdown probability of transformers of the same<br>
type as described in the technical paper "Replacement and<br>
refurbishment strategies for transformer populations" by<br>
Bengtsson, Persson und Svenson.<br>
Design factor means: this factor identifies the relative<br>
risk of a mechanical movement or warp in the windings<br>
because of a short-circuit at the transformer terminal,<br>
based on the special design.  This factor is fixed through<br>
expert opinion with reference to the special transformer<br>
and may include the knowledge of the specific design.<br>
Diag. test display means: this factor is based on results<br>
of the frequency response analysis test (FRA) or on power<br>
factor capacitance tests.  If either the FRA or the power<br>
factor capacitance tests show a significant deviation from<br>
base values (in the case of capacitance, more than 1%<br>
34<br><br>
change in a recognizable pattern), the transformer receives<br>
a diagnostic registration of a risk for mechanical movement<br>
of the windings because of through fault currents.<br>
TD factor means: this identifies the thermal design factor<br>
and is based on the knowledge of the design and evidence<br>
that the specific design is susceptible to unusual hotspots<br>
in the windings and may be subject to the risk of thermal<br>
worsening of the paper insulation in the windings.<br>
CO factor means: since the thermal decomposition of the<br>
cellulose insulation in the winding causes CO and CO2 gas,<br>
unusually high quantities of these gases is an indication<br>
of a risk of excessive aging and brittleness in the paper,<br>
through which a higher breakdown risk could arise.<br>
TC factor means: the TC (= type of the expansion tank)<br>
influences the relative risk of thermally caused<br>
disintegration.  A constant oil conservation system helps<br>
to limit the quantities of moisture and oxygen in the oil<br>
and the reduction of the risk of thermal disintegration<br>
connected therewith.  A system having a nitrogen blanket<br>
has less risk than a sealed system, because the risk of<br>
oxygen and moisture penetrating into the transformer is<br>
lowered.<br>
Load factor means: the load factor relates the risk of<br>
thermal decomposition to the load of the transformer.<br>
Transformers having higher loads typically have higher<br>
winding temperatures and display stronger aging of the<br>
insulation.<br>
35<br><br>
BIL + kV factor means: this factor relates the design BIL<br>
and the rated HV-kV level to the relative breakdown risk.<br>
The factor is based on historical data about transformer<br>
breakdowns in which BIL and kV were known.<br>
Arrester type factor means: older transformers having the<br>
original SiC arresters with spark gaps may experience<br>
higher overvoltages than transformers having newer ZnO<br>
arresters; therefore, they have a higher risk of dielectric<br>
breakdowns.<br>
Dielectric design factor means: transformers having a known<br>
flaw in the dielectric design - generally those with sister<br>
units in which dielectric field breakdowns have occurred -<br>
have a higher risk of a dielectric breakdown.<br>
Electric arc registration factor means: transformers having<br>
abnormally high acetylene values from the DGA results are<br>
subject to a risk of electric arc formation in the<br>
transformer, which may lead to breakdowns.<br>
PD factor means: transformers in which the DGA indicates a<br>
PD (partial discharge) (typically based on hydrogen gas),<br>
have a breakdown risk.<br>
Oil dielectric factor means: transformers having oil which<br>
has test results lying outside the recommended limiting<br>
value for service-aged oils have a higher risk of a<br>
dielectric breakdown.<br>
PF factor means: transformers in which the most recent<br>
power factor dielectric test results lie outside the<br>
36<br><br>
recommended range (generally 0.5%) have a risk of<br>
dielectric breakdown.<br>
LTC type factor means: specific types of load tap changers<br>
(LTC) are subject to a higher breakdown risk than others.<br>
Generally, electric arc tap changers have a higher risk<br>
than interrupter switches.<br>
LTC diag. factor means: if the DGA results show evidence of<br>
abnormal arc formation or unusually high temperatures in<br>
the contacts (because of the ratio of hot metal gas to<br>
hydrogen and acetylene), there is a breakdown risk for the<br>
tap changers.<br>
Bushing type factor means: specific bushing types {e.g.,<br>
the U-bushing of the GE type) have historically shown a<br>
greater breakdown risk than other bushing types.<br>
Bushing diag. factor means: bushings having a higher power<br>
factor or those whose power factor has significantly<br>
increased have a breakdown risk.<br>
Pump breakdown means: ball bearing pumps typically have a<br>
higher risk of causing a breakdown of the main transformer<br>
by releasing metal into the transformer than ring bearing<br>
pumps.<br>
Bushing or LTC aging factor means: load tap changers (LTCs)<br>
or bushings with an age of more than 20 years have a<br>
significantly higher breakdown risk than newer LTCs or<br>
bushings.<br>
37<br><br>
Transformer type factor means: specific transformer types,<br>
including furnace transformers, phase shifter transformers,<br>
and industry transformers, have generally displayed a<br>
higher breakdown rate than other types of transformers.<br>
Location factor means: transformers located on the East<br>
Coast, West Coast, or in the densely populated regions of<br>
the South typically have a higher breakdown risk because of<br>
different factors, such as more short-circuits, higher<br>
fault currents, and higher switching activity (particularly<br>
switching of capacitors).<br>
Seismic factor means: transformers in regions having a<br>
higher earthquake risk are subject to a higher breakdown<br>
risk because of winding movement or damage to bushings or<br>
other fittings in case of an earthquake.<br>
Flow electrification factor means: specific transformer<br>
types which were produced in specific periods of time have<br>
a higher breakdown frequency because of flow<br>
electrification.<br>
Hot metal DGA factor means: transformers having high<br>
contents of a specific combustible gas have a risk of hot<br>
metal in the transformer.  This may not cause a breakdown<br>
of the transformer, but it could require the necessity of<br>
taking the transformer off-line for extraordinary<br>
maintenance or for oil degassing.<br>
Hot winding DGA factor means: transformers whose DGA<br>
results indicate the probability of hot windings (typically<br>
a combination of hot metal gases and carbon oxide gases)<br>
38<br><br>
may have the risk of operational loss because of the<br>
necessity of internal inspection or repair.<br>
Tank hotspot factor means: transformers having high tank<br>
hotspot temperatures, which are generally determined<br>
through infrared thermography, are subject to the risk of<br>
worsening of the oil or problems with the shielding of the<br>
internal tank wall; they may bring about an operational<br>
loss risk because the oil must be processed or the<br>
shielding must be repaired.<br>
Factor loose connection means: transformers which generate<br>
combustible gas {hot metal gas, CO and CO2) under light load<br>
conditions have a risk of loose crimp or screw connections<br>
or faulty soldered connections.  The transformer may have a<br>
risk of operational loss to correct the fault.<br>
On the basis of the breakdown risk calculation and the<br>
relative importance of the transformer for the asset, a<br>
diagram such as Figure 9 is prepared, in which each<br>
transformer in the fleet is shown as a point on the curve.<br>
The scaling factor in the curve is tailored in such a way<br>
that the most important transformers are placed near the<br>
top of the diagram.  The breakdown risk scale is tailored<br>
in such a way that approximately 10% of the transformers<br>
are located in the red zone (preferred).  Using this "■<br>
scaling, it is possible that some of the transformers are<br>
outside the diagram; however, this is not unusual.<br>
The categorization of the transformers in the fleet using<br>
the method of Figure 9 results in both a priority for the<br>
work on the transformers and the reasons for the high<br>
39<br><br>
breakdown risk impact.  We understand breakdown risk impact<br>
as the combination of the importance for the system with<br>
the breakdown risk.  Transformers which are in the red<br>
priority zone generally require immediate attention in<br>
order to decide on possibilities for reducing the breakdown<br>
risk impact.  The risk may be lowered either by reducing<br>
the breakdown risk (for example, using repair or detailed<br>
investigation to clarify a problem) or by reducing the<br>
importance (by adding a replacement to the substation or by<br>
moving a transformer to a less important location).<br>
In the following, an example of a method for service life<br>
profiling of power transformers is to be specified.<br>
The attached flowchart shown in Figure 10 illustrates the<br>
method according to the present invention in an embodiment,<br>
using which precise service life profiling of power<br>
transformers may be performed.<br>
Step 1: Input data<br>
The input data are very important for step 2: design check<br>
and step 3: status evaluation.  For the design evaluation<br>
(step 2), the following data must be available: original<br>
historic design records from the archives and the<br>
statistical data on design performance.  For the status<br>
evaluation (step 3), the following input data is important:<br>
outputs of the last (modern) design program (step 2) and<br>
load histories, test results, maintenance information, test<br>
report with factory certificate, historical and current<br>
status information of inspections, operations, and routine<br>
and advanced diagnostics.<br>
40<br><br>
Step 2: Design check<br>
The detailed design evaluation of the transformer uses the<br>
newest design programs and practices.<br>
For housing-type transformers these include:<br>
1.	MF3D software analysis of leakage flux<br>
2.	Calculating the highest current strength in a<br>
closed circuit<br>
3.	Determining the highest single-conductor<br>
temperature<br>
4.	Calculating the hottest soldered connection<br>
5.	Calculating the highest line temperature<br>
6.	Calculating core-loop voltage and current strength<br>
7.	Hot spot determination of the core<br>
8.	Design potential for flow electrification<br>
9.	Evaluation of the short-circuit strength<br>
For core-type transformers, these include:<br>
1.	TRACE or ACE analysis of leakage flux<br>
2.	Calculating the highest current strengths in a<br>
closed circuit<br>
3.	Determining the highest single-conductor<br>
temperature<br>
4.	Calculating the highest line temperature<br>
5.	Hot point determination of the core<br>
6.	Risk of winding compression loss<br><br>
8.	Design potential for flow electrification<br>
9.	Evaluation of the short-circuit strength with the<br>
aid of TRACE<br>
Step 3: Status evaluation<br>
The purpose of the status evaluation is the evaluation of<br>
the probable status of the internal and external<br>
41<br><br>
transformer parts.  The internal evaluation includes the<br>
insulation system (paper, pressboard, oil, etc.), the core,<br>
mechanical support structures and internal auxiliary<br>
apparatus, such as tap changers and auxiliary transformers<br>
or reactors.  The external system includes the tank, the<br>
cooling system, the controllers, oil conservation systems,<br>
bushings, and integrated protective systems.  The<br>
evaluation combines inputs from the design evaluation with<br>
historical load and operational data as well as routine and<br>
advanced diagnostics.  Advanced diagnostics also play a<br>
significant role in the status evaluation.  The DFR test<br>
(dielectric frequency response) was refined into an<br>
important instrument for diagnosis of the insulation system<br>
status.  This test was used for the purpose of identifying<br>
the exact moisture values in cellulose insulation in order<br>
to support a decision finding in regard to user-specific<br>
drying limits and obtain inputs for the evaluation of the<br>
insulation service life.  In addition, new advances in the<br>
DFR method have been used for the purpose of identifying<br>
specific problems in the transformer, including metal<br>
particle contaminations, contaminations with corrosive<br>
sulfur, carbon cracking, and high-ohmic core-grounding<br>
connections.  Other advanced diagnostic tests, such as a<br>
furan analysis of the oil, FRA (frequency response<br>
analysis), and partial discharge analysis are also<br>
performed as needed■for special cases.<br>
Step 4: Calculation of the useful service life<br>
An important part of the service life profiling method is<br>
the evaluation of the winding insulation and the estimated<br>
remaining life of the paper insulation.  The study uses<br>
historic transformer load data and a thermal simulation of<br>
42<br><br>
the transformer winding and cooling system. Using these<br>
inputs, the cumulative effect of the transformer hotspot<br>
temperatures on the paper insulation is evaluated.<br>
Step 5: Evaluation and rating of the breakdown risk<br>
A further output of the service life profiling is a rating<br>
by units which describes the breakdown risk on the basis of<br>
the results of the design check, the status evaluation, and<br>
the life usage calculation.  This is a very detailed and<br>
precise breakdown risk evaluation, since, besides<br>
statistical and historical parameters, it focuses on the<br>
specific knowledge of the transformer design and its<br>
current status.  The resulting rating provides a precise<br>
judgment of the breakdown risk for the transformer which<br>
may be compared to the expected breakdown risk of other<br>
transformers in the industry.<br>
