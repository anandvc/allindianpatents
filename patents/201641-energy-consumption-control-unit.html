				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>This invention relates to an energy consumption control Unit which is intended to limit the Consumption of Electrical energy to a pre¬determined value. Whenever the electric supply is present and the consumption of the connected load is within the specified limit, the load gets the supply. Whenever the consumption exceeds the specified value beyond a pre-set time, the power supply to the load gets disconnected automatically or a signal is initiated to take corrective action. The reconnection can be automatic, programmable or manual, as desired.<br>
PRIOR ART:<br>
US Patent No. 5590179 describes a remote automatic meter reading apparatus which is capable of sensing, calculating and storing power consumption values at a plurality of electrical utility customer sites and communicating such power consumption values via a communication interface to a central utility site.<br>
EP patent NO. 0420545 describes an electronic watthour meter that is digitally configurable to operate as several different types of watthour meters for metering electrical energy from a variety of different electric utility services and automatic scaling of line input currents is provided to scale the voltage input to an analog to digital converter over selected<br><br>
ranges such that low level and high level input signals are measured in an optimum range.<br>
EP Patent No. 0319235 describes an automated system for controlling the distribution of different services within a house and the said system includes an appliance coordination data network for communicating relatively low speed digital data within the house, a high capacity data network for transferring high speed digital data within the house, etc.<br>
Reference is also made to IEEE Transactions on Consumer Eelectronics' paper entitled "Smart Enabling System for Home Automation" that provides the common resources needed for home automation in a multi-product, multi-vendor environment.<br>
Electricity is normally supplied by distributing Agencies or a Captive Power Source. For Technical and Commercial reasons, it is often necessary to limit the consumption to any particular load or to a particular consumer. The conventional method that is adopted is to measure the energy (metering) consumed by a load or measure the maximum demand that is the peak load consumed by any consumer. These measurements will provide information regarding consumption of energy by a consumer or load and help in arriving at the cost of consumption. The instruments do not limit the supply of energy to any consumer or load.   Hence, the<br><br>
consumer or load can continue to draw power without any limit. The energy meters are normally located with in the consumer premises and the instances of meter tampering and by-passing are not uncommon which will further aggravate the problem of system overloading and revenue loss to the supply companies.<br>
Description of the Invention:<br>
The device of the present invention is more fully described hereunder:<br>
The energy consumption control unit is a measuring and control/cut off device, which checks the consumption to the connected load.<br>
This invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawing. The supply of Electricity to a consumer or to a load is connected through the input terminal 1, 2, 3,4 and through the contacts of an electrically operated disconnecting terminals 5 to terminals lA, 2A, 3A &amp; 4A to which load terminals will be connected. There will be two each input and output terminals for a single phase system, three each input and output terminals for 3 phase three wire system and four each input and output terminals for 3 phase four wire system. The disconnecting terminals 5 will receive the instruction through the cut off mechanism 12 provided in the control unit.<br><br>
A voltage signal 6 from the input terminals and a current signal 7 from each of the phases is taken to the signal processing unit 8 for sensing. These signals are proportional to the consumption by the load.<br>
A processor 9 with an embedded software measures the current or power consumption continuously. The processor 9 will be loaded with a set of software instructions such as allowable consimiption, allowable excess consumption, allowable time for excess consumption, the nature of output signals to be provided in case of excess consumption, the manner and duration of disconnection of the load on extended excess power drawings from supply sources, the means of re-connection of the load, interruption data storage and data communication. An amplifier and comparator 10 is provided in between the signal processing unit 8 and the processor 9 to amplify the signals received from the processing unit 8. The entire unit is provided with a power supply unit 11. It may be noted that the amplifier and comparator unit can be an individual unit or it can be included in the processor itself<br>
The actual dynamic values of the consumption parameters are continuously compared to the stored instructions in the processor. Whenever a deviation is seen by way of excess consumption, the processor executes a programmed instruction.<br><br>
This instruction could be for the execution of one or more of the<br>
following tasks:<br>
(i)      Full or Partial load disconnection;<br>
(ii)     Disconnection for a pre-determined duration;<br>
(iii)   Provide a warning signal of excess load;<br>
(iv)    Record data of excess load and duration with date and time stamping;    and<br>
(v) Provide a communication of excess load data through an appropriate link to a host computer for data logging of individual units and analysis where more than one consumption control units are connected in a supply network. Being a software based system, each device can have its own identity by a specific address code that helps remote monitoring and remote data exchange between a host computer and any specific device through any protocol, including unloading the data through a hand held device, or radio frequency signals.<br>
The device can be used either as an individual piece of equipment or integrated in to a system.<br>
As an individual unit it can be mounted on a pole top or with in a feeder pillar box in an overhead or under ground distribution system, providing supply to individual consumers.   It can also be mounted with in the<br><br>
consumer premises or on a specific load. The unit can be put in to any suitable enclosure to make it scalable, tamper proof and weather proof.<br>
On board flashing lamp in the event of supply cut off due to excess load can provide a visual alert.<br>
When integrated with an energy measuring instrument or meter, it can check the energy consumption beyond a pre-determined peak load and initiate a cut off or warning signal. Similarly, when integrated and housed inside a distribution transformer in association with an electrically operated cut off device, it can continuously monitor the load on the distribution transformer and initiate partial or total disconnection of load to protect the transformer from bum-outs due to overload. On the same lines, the device can be integrated with any electrically operated load discoimecting devices such as contactors and breakers and turn them into self regulating switching equipments.<br><br><br>
