Field of the invention<br>
The invention relates to a chute distributing device, particularly to the bell less top in<br>
blast furnace having a chute distributing device.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
Chute distributing system is a charging device of blast furnace.   There are now several<br>
driving forms of chute distributing device, such as planet gear speed difference,<br>
hydraulic pressure, chain or mechanical drive forms. These distributing devices can<br>
make flexible and well-proportioned distribution and have reliable performance and<br>
compact structure in comparison with the past devices of the same type.   Once they<br>
came into the world, they have been widely introduced in blast furnaces.    But<br>
shortcomings exist in all of them.   For a planet speed difference drive-distributing<br>
device,   it  has  a  complicated   structure  with  high   manufacturing,   operating  and<br>
maintenance costs.     For a hydraulic pressure drive-distributing device,  it has an<br>
enormous equipment system with high installation and operation costs.   For a cable<br>
drive form, the non-robustness problems caused by twining and abrasion exist. For a<br>
mechanical single lever drive form, it has a simple structure, however, its raceway<br>
always be worn and torn on a single side and thus the control precision is decreased<br>
because a radial force emerges in the towing loop in lifting motion as it is hoisted by two<br>
points with a single lever. Further, the hermetization effects of all the above devices are<br>
not sufficient.<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
The objects of the invention is to overcome the shortcomings in the prior art and<br>
provides a blast furnace top chute distributing device that has more reasonable structure,<br>
produces no radial force in lifting motion, causes no single side of an orbit worn and torn,<br>
has small size and low height, and with good hermetization effect.<br>
The technical solution of the invention for solving the above-mentioned technical<br>
problems is provided as follows:<br>
The blast furnace top chute distributing device of the invention comprises a hermetical<br>
cylinder casing comprising a cabinet, a water-cooling dish and a top cover.   An output<br>
gear of a motor speed reduction unit fixed to the top cover engages an upper swing<br><br>
bearing having external teeth fixed in the internal top cover, thus a rotating sleeve fixed with the upper swing bearing is driven and rotated. A chute is positioned in the lower part of the rotating sleeve and is connected with the rotating sleeve through trunnions on its both sides, thus the rotation of the chute is achieved. The motor speed reducing unit on the outside of the cabinet drives the two revolution axes to swing synchronously in opposite or reverse directions. Four driving arms are provided respectively on the two revolution axes and articulated with four suspending points of the towing loop through connecting rods. Contact rollers fixed to the towing loop are coordinated with an anti-rotating sliding guide provided on the inner wall of the cabinet, thus the up and down and reciprocating movement is achieved. The towing loop is fixed and connected with the outer ring of the lower swing bearing. A thumb wheel unit is provided on the inner ring of the lower swing bearing. The thumb wheels on the thumb wheel unit coordinates with a vertical chute on the outside wall of the rotating sleeve, forming a synchronous rotating movement of the lower swing bearing and the rotating sleeve. The trunnions connected with the chute are respectively fixed and connected with cranks. On the other end of each crank, a pulley is provided and coordinated with a bar-shaped notch provided on the skeleton frame of the inner ring of the lower swing bearing. Through the up and down reciprocating movement of the towing loop, the object of dumping motion of the chute is achieved. Therefore, the chute can complete rotating movement only,  dumping only,  or rotating while dumping.  Further,   Fixed-point distribution, fanwise distribution, single ring distribution and multi ring distribution can all be realized.<br>
A seal receptacle is provided with interference on the outside cylinder surface of the water-cooling dish. Between the outside cylinder surface of the seal receptacle and the inner cylinder surface of the water-seal cover of the rotating sleeve, it is interference sealed by three elastic sealing rings in the middle part of the seal receptacle. Between the upper end face of the seal receptacle and the upper surface of the water-seal cover of the rotating sleeve, it is sealed through two sealing rings, the first ring is a nitrogen gas annular curtain sealing, and the second is a floating magnetic sealing ring. Further, two annular notches are provided on either the inside and outside surfaces of the seal receptacle cylinder, in which asbestos packing set is placed. On the seal receptacle, a lube oil duct and an oil hole communicating with the annular notches are provided. The beneficial effects of this invention are: the dumping motion of the chute is realized<br><br>
by the motor speed reduction unit provided outside the casing driving the two revolution axes to swing synchronously in opposite or reverse directions, and the four points pivot connecting of the connecting rods and the towing loop through the driving arms. As a symmetrical drive with double revolution axes is adopted, the radial forces produced in the up and down movement of the towing loop could counterweigh each other. Further, as the four connecting rods driving the towing loop, the towing loop could not deflect in the up and down movement of the towing loop. In addition, as a pair of rotating wheels is omitted, the height of the device could be reduced greatly resulting higher operation stability. As a floating magnetic sealing ring being added on the basis of the current labyrinth seal and elastic seal, it forms an integral compound sealing in which a nitrogen gas annular curtain sealing and a floating magnetic sealing coexist. Therefore, the sealing performance is greatly enhanced, the consumption of nitrogen gas is effectively reduced and the working life of the device is extended. Statement of Invention<br>
