METHOD FOR MANUFACTURING ENANTIOMERIC IMIDAZOLE COMPOUNDS Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to a method for manufacturing enantiomeric imidazole compounds comprising R-sertaconazole, and salts and solvazes thereof.<br>
Brief description of illustrations<br>
Fig. 1 shows the formulas of compounds (I) - (VII).<br>
Background of the invention<br>
Sertaconazole (INN-WHO) is an antifungal agent broadly used in the therapy of infections caused by fungi and yeasts in man an animals. Sertaconazole is 1- [2- (7-chlorobenzo [b] thiopheno-3-ylmethoxy) -2- (2 , 4-dichlorophenyl) ethyl] -1H-imidazole. Commonly sertaconazole is used as mononitrate salt (I).<br>
EP 151477, which is merely cited as an illustration, discloses the preparation of sertaconazole mononitrate (I) by reacting 1- (2 , 4-dichlorophenyl) -2- (Iff-imidazol-1-yl) -ethanol (II) with sodium hydride and 3-bromomethyl-7-chlorobenzo [b] thiophene (III, L = Br) in hexamethyl-phosphoramide and treating the resulting sertaconazole; free base with nitric acid.<br>
Applicants have discovered that out of the two potential enantiomers of sertaconazole, the antifungal activity mainly lies in the R-(-)-enantiomer. It is, therefore, of a great interest to develop improved methods for<br><br>
WO 2006/029811	PCT/EP2005/009824<br>
2<br>
manufacturing R- (-)-sertaconazole (IV) and its derived salts. R- (-)-sertaconazole (IV) and its preferred salt, the raononitrate (V), have been disclosed in WO 03068770. £-(-)-sertaconazole (IV) and R- (-) -sertaconazole mononitrate (V) are potent antifungal agents for medicinal, veterinary and agricultural use.<br>
WO 03068770 discloses the preparation of R-(-) -sertaconazole (IV) by reacting R-(-) -1-(2,4-dichlorophenyl) -2- (lH-imidazol-1-yl) -ethanol (VI) with 3-(chloromethyl or bromomethyl) -7-chlorobenzo [b] thiophene (III, L = Cl, Br) in N,N-dimethylf ormamide and in the presence of potassium t-butoxide as a base. The yield of this operation is only 25%. Thereafter, the mononitrate salt (V) is obtained by acidifying with nitric acid in a mixture of ethanol and water (yield = 89%) . Overall yield of the process is then 22% only.<br>
Description<br>
The present invention provides a new chemical process for the preparation of R-(-) -sertaconazole mononitrate (V).<br>
More specifically, the present invention provides a phase-transfer process for manufacturing R- (-)-sertaconazole mononitrate (V), which is more advantageous than the process described in WO 03068770. In contrast to the latter, the pirocess of this invention avoids the use of column chromatography, which is a hardly operational procedure because it is slow and costly and requires large amounts of solvent. In addition, the process of this invention provides an unexpected higher yield and leads to a product having the appropriate characteristics for its<br><br>
WO 2006/029811	PCT/EP2W5/009824<br>
