				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>This invention relates to an improved bogie control arm system for steering wheels and axle,<br>
bogies for railway-wagons and carriages.<br>
Cast steel bogies with three piece 'H' frame comprising two side frames and a bolster connecting the side frames are very much in use throughout the world railways for carrying wagons with heavy freight and at high speed.<br>
This conventional bogie has two pairs of wheels with axles viz a front pair of wheels and a rear pair of wheels for facilitating running of the wagon on rails. The wheels are firmly fitted on axle which rotates together while running and are held in position by the 'H' frame at end of axles through boxes. It is the 'H' frame which plays a major part for the total behaviour of the bogie.<br>
There are disadvantages associated with the present system of 'H' frame bogies.<br>
One of the main disadvantages associated with the present system of conventiohl  'H' frame bogies is that when the wheels run on a pair of straight rail tracks, when there is a perfect alignment between the wheel flange and rail head and the wear of the wheel flange and rail head may be minimum. This in general is not practicable during manufacture. When tolerances are applied the trueness of geometry is affected and wear propensity increases. Also when the wheels negotiate a curved track the wheel flange strikes the rail head at an angle called angle of the attack. Due to continuous rubbing of the wheel flange on rail head both wears very fast.<br>
-2 -<br><br>
a)	excessive wheel wear,<br>
b)	wear of rail head and loss of rail head profile,<br>
c)	derailment caused by (a) &amp; (b) above.<br>
To overcome these disadvantages various attempt were made to improve the life of the bogie and the safety of operation at high speed. These are briefly described below:<br>
1 . Lubrication of rail head for reducing wheel wear and rail wear by automatic spraying of oil at the negotiating curved track.<br>
This has not been found very much productive/effective in view of wheels touching the rails at a very wide angle and at a very high speed and high momentum value.<br>
2. Cross Brace Bogie has been developed to maintain alignment of bogie/truck wheels by providing cross bracings diagonally for meeting wheel alignment or squarity at each diagonally opposite ends of the bogie.<br>
The system suffers from being too fragile for heavy rough work needed for wagons or freight cars moving at high speed over rough track condition. The system definitely requires repeated maintenance.  The replacement costs are quite high.<br>
-4-<br><br>
3.	C-Type Cast Steel Steering Arm   is a single piece casting<br>
connected with the axle box adopter at end of axles. This single<br>
piece casting is very heavy and reduces the carrying capacity<br>
appreciably  to  the  extent of  its  self weight.  This system<br>
requires side lining of the wagon/car for a considerale period<br>
for maintenance or over hauling of the steering device or the<br>
bogie.<br>
The wagon superstructure is to be fully removed to have access for even general maintenance work required for the Bogie steering arms. Even a localised defect may require total replaceent of the arm resulting into added cost. Adopters are connected only on inside lugs resulting into lesser amount of grip on axle journals.<br>
4.	C-Type fabricated Mild Steel Steering Arm   has so far been<br>
designed with welded flat sections  involvinglarge amount of<br>
weld metal deposition which leads to distortions of the arm<br>
after welding. This are rectified by heavy press work which<br>
causes internal stresses in the arm as well as in the weld bids.<br>
The initial distortion tries to come back due to constant stress<br>
and stress during service and the geometry get lost.<br>
Out of the above four types of improved bogies, the last one namely the 'C-type fabricated mild steel steering arm' has partially improved the performance but for the drawbacks or disadvantages as mentioned.<br>
-5-<br><br>
There are many types of steering bogies which are in service mostly in Metre Gauge and some in the Standard Gauge. The Metre Gauge bogies are known as " Scheffel Cross Anchor Bogie" which run on 1067 mm track gauge. There are other versions of this bogie known as "Barber Radial", "Amsted AR-1" and "Amsted AR2" which are on the 1435 mm track gauge. These bogies have the 'C' Arms only for in-board type of different constructional details.<br>
The present invention is for improved and easy construction of in-board steering mechanism and also newly invented out-board steering mechanism.<br>
There is no steering bogies where the steering device can be retrofitted on the existing bogies in service. This type of steering mechanism of the inventor has the ability to render the vendor to retrofitment on the existing bogies. In addition to such retrofitment, the same will additionally accommodate retrofitment of clasp Brake and Bogie Mounted Brake.<br>
-6-<br><br>
Therefore the main object of the present invention is to propose an improved bogie which when used for high speed run has less wear with increased life and light safety standard.<br>
This invention provides for the control arms device for outboard or in-board application. In all cases scope is given for incorporating clasp brakes or bogie mounted brakes of single shoe type or bogie mounted brakes of clasp brake types.<br>
According to the present invention there is provided an improved bogie control arm system for steering wheels and axles of 'H-frame' bogies for railway wagons and carriages comprising two pairs of C-shaped control arms for outboard application made of mild steel fabrication or cast steel, each C-shaped control arm surrounding at outboard side of a respective steering wheel with each side of each C-shaped control arm extending past a respective axle of a 'H-frame' bogie and fabricated adapters connected to each pair of said control arms, said fabricated adapters being configured to connect with a rubber spring as primary suspension, said two pairs of 'C'-shaped control arms being connected to each other by means of cross struts thereby allowing an improved angle of attack while a bogie negotiates a curve or track irregularity.<br>
The C-arms of both the types of this invention may be fabricated or cast steel.<br>
The nature of the invention, its objective and further advantages residing in the same will be apparent from the following description made with reference to the non-limiting exemplary embodiments of the invention represented in the accompanying drawings :<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
Figures 1a, 1b, 1c illustrates three different exemplary-angles of attack which has been described earlier. Figures 1d and 1 e illustrate tread profile when new and after it has been worn out. The obj ect of the invention is to propose a bogie which improves the angle of attack during negotiating a curve. So worn out of the tread is minimised and the Wagon or freight car with the improved bogie can negotiate the curve at higher speed.<br>
Figures 2 and 3 shows the improved bogie of our invention with out-board 'C' Arm and Figure 2A and 3A shows the improved bogie with in-board Arm.<br>
The bogie primarily comprises of an 'H' frame formed by the bolster (2) and a pair of side frames (1a, 1b). The two side frames are mounted over the axle boxes (4) of the wheels and axles (3a,3b). Two C-type arms,one for out-board application (5a,6a;5b,6b) or for in-board application (5'a,5'b; 6'a and 6'b) used in pair and comprises the control arms for each axle (3a,3b),<br>
The two pairs of ' C' type control arms are connected by two numbers of cross struts (9) by means of pins (10).<br>
The details of the cross struts (9) has been illustrated in Figures 7A and 7B. The cross struts (9) has been made in such a way that the distance between its eye centres can be made exact to its requirement by the help of its screwed type eye ends (12), nuts (14,15) and back nuts (13). This arrangement provides improved steering of the axles.<br>
-9-<br><br>
The eye ends (12) have been fitted with spherical bearing (11) to control the level differences of the axles (3a,3b) while running on rough rail tracks.<br>
Four numbers of M.S. fabricated adoptor (7) is connected with the C-type control arms 5a,6a,5b,6b for out-board application and 5'a,6'a, 5'b and 6'b for in-board application by means of welding or rivetting or bolting or huck bolting. The fabricated adopter (7) is provided with rubber spring as primary suspension which has different stiffness for longitudinal and lateral direction which gives improved riding characteristic of the bogie.<br>
The C-type control arms (5a,6a;5b,6b and/or 5'a,6'a,5'b,6'b) have  been illustrated in detail in Figures 4 and 5 for out-board type and figures 6, 6A,6B and 6C for in-board type. These C-arms may be made of cast steel or may be made by other type of fabrication from mild steel.<br>
These design of C-type arms provide-<br>
a)	adequate strength<br>
b)	less  welding in comparison to other design of fabricated<br>
type.<br>
c)	lesser distortion due to lesser welding,<br>
d)	lesser weight in comparison to other design.<br>
The normal invention of C-type arms (5a,6a,5b,6b) for outboard type 5'a, 6'a, 5'b, 6'b for in-board type and struts (9) is novel and can be retrofitted  in existing bogies with minor modification or without any modification irrespective of its wheel diameter, track gauge or make.<br>
-10-<br><br>
The features of the invention of C-type control  arm (5a,6a; 5b,6b for, out-board type and 5'a, 6'a, 5'b, 6'b for in-board application)and its cross struts (9) can be easily mounted or dismounted without the necessity of disturbing. any major structure of the wagon, either for overhaul repair or replacement.<br>
 The control arm (5a,5b;6a,6b for out-board application and 5'a, 5'b,6'a,6'b for in-board application) for steering arrangement for bogies/trucks with the angle of wheels (axes) according to the curvature of the track rails i.e. tangentially to the track rails and minimise the wear of wheel flange and rail heads<br>
The control arm (5a,5b;6a,6b for out-board application and 5'a, 5'b, 6'a, 6'b for in-board application)for self steering arrangement when fitted on bogies shall prevent de-railment of the wagon/ freight car while carrying heavy hauls at higher speeds.<br>
The control arm (5a,5b;6a,6b for out-board application and 5'a, 5'b, 6'a, 6'b for in-board application) and strut (9) for self steering arrangement shall enable the wagon, when its bogies are being fitted with these to carry/haul substantial amount of freight at a higher speed of 100 k.m.p.h or more and thereby making the haulage of goods more economical.<br>
The design of control arm (5a,5b;6a,6b for out board application and 5'a, 5'b, 6'a, 6'b for in-board application) can be fitted/dismantled quicker than other such system requiring lesser time for repair, overhaul or change.<br>
-11-<br><br>
The  design has primary suspension spring of rubber at axle box adoptor which has higher stiffness in the longitudinal direction and lesser stiffness in the lateral direction which attribute a good riding characteristics of the bogies at higher speed when fitted with this arrangement. The novel control arm (5a,5b;6a,6b for out-board application 5'a, 5'b, 6'a, 6'b for in-board application)f or self steering arrangement and all its related components can be manufactured indigenously and at low cost.<br>
This  design permits negotiation of curves and track irregularities without the wheel flange coming into contact with the rail and the few occassion that it does it will be a trailing contact and not a leading contact. The invention described hereinabove is in relation to a non-limiting embodiment and as defined by the accompanying claims.<br>
