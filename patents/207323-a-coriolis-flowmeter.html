LATERAL MODE STABILIZER  FOR CORIOUS FLOWMETER<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention pertains to Coriolis flowmeters and, more particularly, to apparatus and a method for altering the lateral mode flow tube vibration frequencies of a Coriolis flowmeter. This invention further pertains to apparatus and a method for increasing the frequency separation between the flow tube resonant drive frequency and the flow tube lateral mode vibration frequencies.<br>
PROBLEM<br>
Coriolis flowmeters are characterized by a flow tube through which material flows while the flow tube is caused to vibrate at its resonant frequency. When material is not flowing, every point on the flow tube vibrates in phase with every other point on the flow tube. Two pick off devices positioned at different points on the flow tube generate sinusoidal signals that have the same phase when no material flows and have a phase difference between them when material flows. This phase difference is due to Coriolis forces generated by material flow through the vibrating flow tube. The magnitude of the phase difference between any two points along the length of the flow tube is substantially proportional to the mass flow rate of the material flow. Coriolis mass flowmeters employ signal processing that determines this phase difference and produces an output signal indicating the mass flow rate along with other information pertaining the material flow.<br>
In operation, the flow tube is driven out of phase with an adjacent parallel member, such as a balance bar for a straight tube Coriolis flowmeter. The drive force is generated by an electro mechanical driver which generates out of phase vibrations of the flow tube and the balance bar at their combined resonant frequency. For discussion purposes, the balance bar and flow tube may be said to be driven in a vertical plane by the driver. These vertical vibrations are relatively large since they are at the first out of phase bending mode of the flow tube and balance bar and they are driven at their resonant frequency.<br>
The Coriolis deflections of the vibrating flow tube with material flow also occur in the same vertical plane as the drive vibrations. The Coriolis deflections occur at the drive frequency but the tube deflection has the shape of a bending mode with a higher frequency. Therefore the amplitude of the Coriolis deflections is considerably less than the amplitude of the flow tube drive frequency vibrations. Even though the amplitude of the Coriolis response is relatively small, it is the Coriolis response that<br><br>
generates the pick off output signals that are processed by meter electronics apparatus to generate the desired mass flow rate and other information pertaining to the flowing material. The output error of a Coriolis flowmeter may typically be .15% or less. In order to achieve this accuracy, it is necessary that the Coriolis pick off signals be free as possible from noise and unwanted signals that can impair processing of the Coriolis pick off signals.<br>
In the operation of a Coriolis flowmeter, the signals induced in the pick offs comprise not only the desired small amplitude Coriolis response signals, but also comprise unwanted signals that are applied to the processing circuitry along with the desired Coriolis response signals. The receipt of these unwanted signals impairs the ability of the processing circuitry to generate output signals meeting the objective of less than .15% error.<br>
The unwanted pick off signals may be caused by ambient noise from the surrounding environment. Ambient noise may be due to near by machinery and vibrations caused by nearby automobile and railroad traffic. It may also be caused by vibrations in the pipeline to which the Coriolis flowmeter is connected. Ambient noise can be overcome by proper mounting of the flowmeter to isolate it from the vibrations caused by machinery and traffic. The noise from connected pipeline vibrations can be overcome by appropriate isolation of the flowmeter from the pipeline.<br>
Another source for the unwanted signals is unwanted vibrations in the flowmeter. These unwanted vibrations are more difficult to overcome and can be minimized, but not eliminated, by improved flowmeter design.<br>
All Coriolis flowmeters have mode shapes that result from driving the flow tube at its resonant frequency. A typical flowmeter has vibrational modes that are characterized by their shape as follows:<br>
In phase bend (IPB)<br>
In-phase lateral (IPL)<br>
Out-of phase bend (Drive)<br>
Out-of phase lateral (OPL)<br>
Balance bar second (bend) The out of phase bend is the desired drive mode; the rest are unwanted modes. Al! of these modes are inherent to any Coriolis flowmeter; but good design can minimize, but not eliminate, the-unwanted modes. Also, the frequency of these modes changes<br><br>
with the density of the flowing material. When a mode changes frequency, there is a potential for interaction between neighboring modes that may cause the flowmeter to become unstable and produce incorrect output date. As mentioned above, the mode that is desired and used to generate the desired output information of the flowmeter is the out of phase bend drive mode. It is this mode that generates the Coriolis forces. The resulting Coriolis response is detected by the pick offs which generate the signals that are used to provide the flowmeter output information.<br>
The in phase lateral and the out of phase lateral vibrations are a problem that must be address in the design of any flowmeter. It is an objective of good Coriolis flowmeter design to ensure that the drive frequency is separated from the lower in-phase lateral frequency and the higher out-of phase lateral frequency by an amount sufficient to avoid or minimize the adverse effects of the two different lateral frequencies on the processing of the Coriolis separate response signal. This is necessary so that the electronic processing circuitry can generate output signals having the required error of less than .15%.<br>
The unwanted lateral vibrations can be excited by the drive frequency due to asymmetry of the various flowmeter parts as well as by the ambient noise. The existence of the lateral vibrations is tolerable as long as the frequencies are separated from the drive frequency by sufficient amount. If this separation is inadequate, the proximity of the lateral frequencies to the drive signal frequency can produce beat frequencies and interactions that produce unwanted pick-offs signals that are applied to the electronic processing circuitry along with the desired Coriolis response signal. If these undesired lateral mode signals have an excessive amplitude and/or are close to the frequency of the Coriolis response signal, the electronic processing circuitry may be unable to process the Coriolis signal to generate output information having the desired accuracy.<br>
It may be seen from the above that it is a problem in the design and operation of Coriolis flowmeters to minimize the adverse impact of signals generated by undesired modes of vibration so that the processing of the Coriolis response signal and the output accuracy of the output signal of the flowmeter is not compromised.<br>
SOLUTION<br>
The above problem is solved and an advance in the art is achieved by the present invention which comprises apparatus and a method for altering the vibrational characteristics of Coriolis flowmeter flow tubes so that the drive and Coriolis response<br><br>
frequency is separated by an adequate amount from both the in-phase and out-of phase lateral vibration frequencies. This increased separation enhances the ability of the associated meter electronics to process the Corioiis response signal so that it can achieve the desired output accuracy.<br>
As above described, the unwanted signals that can interfere with the processing of the Corioiis response signals are due to two causes. The first is caused by the presence of ambient noise. The second is due to unwanted vibrations in the structure of the flowmeter. Both of these causes can produce unwanted signals which can impair signal processing of the Corioiis response signal.<br>
Ambient noise can be reduced to an acceptable level by improved mechanical isolation of the Corioiis flowmeter from the source of the noise. The signals generated by the unwanted flowmeter vibrations are primarily due to asymmetry in the flowmeter structure. This asymmetry may be due to imperfect mounting of the driver and/or pick offs in the vertical plane. This asymmetry may also be due to imperfect welds or braze operations in the meter fabrication. As a result of this asymmetry, a driver, for example, may vibrate the flow tube in a desired vertical plane; but may also vibrate the flow tube to a lesser extent in an undesired lateral plane. Similarly, the attachment of the pick offs to the flow tube may be less than perfect so that the pick offs respond primarily to motion in the vertical plane, but they also respond to motion in the lateral plane. In other words, no Corioiis flowmeter achieves total perfection in eitherits fabrication and/or operation and, as a result, elements of the flowmeter which should operate only in a vertical plane also have a response, even though small, in a plane that is perpendicular to the vertical plane. As a result, these elements have an undesired lateral component to their vibration as well as the desired vertical component. This lateral component, all though small-, can cause unwanted signals in the pick off outputs.<br>
The solution to the unavoidable presence of lateral vibrations is to alter the flowmeter structural characteristics to achieve control overthe lateral vibration frequencies. This enables the lateral vibration frequencies to be separated a greater amount from the frequency of the drive signal and the Corioiis response signal.The increased frequency separation reduces both the lateral vibration amplitude and beat frequencies and their interactions with the Corioiis response signal. The increased separation of the lateral mode frequencies from the drive and Corioiis response frequencies also permits easier processing of the Corioiis response signal by the associated meter electronics. A lateral<br><br>
mode frequency that is unacceptably close to the Coriolis response signal frequency requires an extremely narrow band width and selectivity in the signal processing circuitry. This narrow band width and selectivity is difficult and expensive to achieve.<br>
Conversely, when lateral mode vibration frequencies are separated by an adequate amount from the Coriolis response frequency, the band width and selectivity requirements of the meter electronics element is reduced so that the Coriolis response signal can be processed to achieve the desired accuracy in the flowmeter output information. The reason for this is that the increased frequency separation permits the selectivity of the meter electronics to reject, or reduce to an acceptable level, the lateral mode signals. The apparatus and method of the present invention achieves control of the lateral vibration frequencies by the use of a concentric ring affixed over the ends of the flow tube with lateral axial extensions on the ring contacting the flow tube on each of its sides. These lateral axial extensions increase the flow tubes stiffness for lateral vibrations significantly and only moderately affect the flow tube vibrations in the vertical (drive) plane. As a result, an increased separation is achieved between the vertical flow tube (drive) frequency and the flow tube lateral vibration frequencies. This increased frequency separation eliminates the undesirable consequences of the lateral mode vibration frequencies by making signal processing of the Coriolis response signal easier with enhanced accuracy in the flowmeter output information.<br>

On figure 7, element 307 is the left end of flow tube 303 and element 308 is the right end of flow tube 303. Flanges 306 enable flow tube 303 to be connected<br><br>
to a pipeline for receiving the material to be processed by flowmeter 300. Holes 801 in flanges 306 enable the flowmeter to be coupled to the pipeline.<br>
Lateral mode stabilizer element 101 is shown coupled to each end of balance bar 302. Lateral mode stabilizer 101 couples balance bar 302 to flow tube 303 and to case connect link 401. The left outer end 407 of each case connect link 401 is shown connected to the inner surface 321 of wall 321 of case 301 on figure 4. The junction 410 of the right end 403 of case connect link 401 on figure 4 is where the inner wall 321 of case 301 meets the right end of case connect link 401.<br>
Figures 7 and 8 show the details of lateral mode stabilizer element 101 and its connection to flow tube 303 and balance bar 302. On figure 7, lateral mode stabilizer 101 is shown coupled to the left and right ends of balance bar 302. Lateral mode stabilizer 101 is affixed to the end of balance bar 302 and positioned between balance bar 302 and flow tube 303. The circumferential ring element 204 of stabilizer 101 completely encircles flow tube 303. The lateral extension 108 on each side of stabilizer 101 projects axially inwardly towards the center of flow tube 303.<br>
The showing of figures 7 and 8 is essentially the same except that figure 8 is a cross sectional view of all flowmeter elements while on figure 7, the lateral mode stabilizer 101 are shown in greater detail. Accordingly, the braze groove 107 on figure 1 appears on figure 8 as a narrow void between flow tube 303 and lateral extensions 108.<br>
It can be seen from the preceding description of flowmeter 300 that the presence of lateral mode stabilizer 101 enables the vertical vibrations of the flow tube 303 to be relatively unaffected by lateral mode stabilizer 101 and its lateral extensions 108. It can also be seen that the lateral extensions 108 are affective in altering the lateral vibrational characteristics of flow tube 303 as shown on figures 7 and 8. These lateral extension 108 stiffen the lateral portions of the flow tube 303 to which they are affixed. In so doing, the vibration node or pivot point for lateral vibrations of flow tube 303 is effectively moved inwardly to the inner end 104 of each lateral extension 108. This effectively shortens the vibration length of f lowtube 303 for lateral vibrations and raises the resonant frequency of the lateral vibrations. Description of Figure 9<br>
Figure 9 is an exterior top view of the flowmeter of figure 4. Shown on figure 9 are case 301, case connect link 401, flow tube 303, balance bar 302, ring element 204 and lateral extensions 108 of case connect link 101.<br><br><br>
Tables 1 and 2 show the benefits provided by the lateral mode stabilizer of the present invention. Table 1 shows the figures obtained from a base line uncompensated flowmeter for materials having a specific gravity of .5,1.0, and 1.5. Table 2 shows the results of a flowmeter embodying the lateral mode stabilizer of the present invention.<br>
In both tables 1 and 2t the columns designated SG represents the specific gravity, the column designated IPL represents the in-phase lateral resonant frequency, the column designated Drive F represents the resonant drive frequency and the column designated OPL represents an out of phase lateral resonant frequency. The left most column designated AF represents the frequency difference between the in-phase lateral frequency and the drive frequency. The right most column designated AF represents the frequency difference between the drive frequency and the out of phase lateral resonant frequency.<br>
Table 1 indicates that for a specific gravity of .5, the AF between the IPL and the drive frequency Drive F is 141. This is an acceptable frequency separation so far as concerns the selectivity of the meter electronics element for the processing of the pick off signals. However, the AF between the Drive F and the OPL frequencies for an SG of .5 is only 7. This is an unacceptable frequency separation. It is also so seen that the AF between the Drive F and the OPL frequencies is 1 SHnd 35 for specific gravities of 1.0 and 1.5 respectfully. There are also unacceptable separations.<br>
Table 2 shows the result obtained when a lateral mode stabilizer is incorporated into a flowmeter comparable'to the baseline flowmeter of table 1. It can be seen in table 2 that for all of the indicated values of specific gravity, the AF-between the IPL and the Drive F frequencies is considerably increased overthat forthe comparable meter<br><br>
of table 1. Also, it can be seen that the AF between the Drive F and OPL frequencies is significantly increased over that for the comparable AF of the baseline flowmeter of table 1. The AF's of 46, 48, and 55 for specific gravities of .5, 1.0 and 1.5 respectfully are raised considerably and represent an adequate frequency separation to enable the meter electronics element 316 to satisfactorily process these signals and obtain output information of the required accuracy.<br>
As can be seen from table 2, the lateral mode stabilizer allows the lateral modes of the flowmeter to be increased as well as the AF and Drive F and OPL frequencies to be kept reasonably constant. This allows greaterf lexibility in design since the lateral frequency of the OPL can be lowered without the complication of potential modal cross over or interference. This results in a meter of increased signal stability.<br>
In summary, it can be seen from the foregoing that the provision of a lateral mode stabilizer in a flowmeter provides increased frequency separation between the wanted and unwanted frequencies and thereby permits the desired Coriolis pick off signals to be precessed with greater ease to generate output data of increased accuracy.<br>
