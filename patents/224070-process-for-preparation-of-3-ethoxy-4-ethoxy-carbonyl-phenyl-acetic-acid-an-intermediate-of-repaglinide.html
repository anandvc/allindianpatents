3. PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION		<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner<br>
in which it is to be performed.	<br><br>
Field of invention:<br>
The present invention relates to an efficient and cost effective process for preparation of 3-Ethoxy-4-(ethoxycarbonyl)-phenyl acetic acid (V), a key intermediate in the preparation of an anti-diabetic drug, Repaglinide of formula (VI). More particularly, the present invention relates to an improved process for preparation of compound (V), which involves non-hazardous and cost effective raw materials making the process simple, economical and industrially viable.<br>
Background of the invention:<br>
Repaglinide, S (+) 2- ethoxy-4-{N-{l-(2-piperidinophenyl) -3-methyl-l-butyl}-aminocarbonylmethyl] benzoic acid (Formula VI) is known from US 5,216,167 and 5,312,924. Repaglinide is the first member of type II non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM); a new class of oral hypoglycemic agents (meglitinides). It stimulates the secretion of insulin from beta cells in the pancreas, acting via calcium channels. Hypoglycemic events are less with Repaglinide as compared to other anti-diabetic agents. It offers a significantly better biological profile as compared to other sulphonyl urea class of hypoglycemic agents and approved by the U.S. FDA for treatment of non-insuline dependent diabetes mellitus (type-II diabetes).<br>
US application 2004192955 discloses a process for the preparation of ethyl 3-ethoxy-4-ethoxycarbonyl-phenylacetate of formula (V) which comprises of reacting 4-methyl salicylic acid with diethyl sulfate in presence of potassium carbonate in polar organic solvent at temperature 50-80° C for 6-12 hrs, the product obtained was filtered and the organic solvent was distilled to obtain the residue of ethyl-2-ethoxy-4-methylbenzoate which was further reacted with N-bromosuccinamide in carbon tetrachloride at temperature 40-60° C to obtain ethyl-4-bromomethyl-2-ethoxy benzoate. The obtained compound was reacted with carbon monoxide in ethyl alcohol at temperature of 30-50° C. for 14-24 hrs, in the presence of a palladium catalyst to obtain ethyl 3-ethoxy-4-ethoxycarbonyl-phenylacetate.<br>
US6686497 describes the process for the preparation of 3-ethoxy-4-(ethoxycarbonyl)-phenyl acetic acid which comprises of reacting 4-methylsalicylic acid with ethyl bromide in dimethylsulphoxide in presence of potassium carbonate at temperature within a range<br><br>
ambient to 100°C preferably 30-40° C during a period of one to several hours to obtain<br>
ethyl 2-ethoxy-4-methylbenzoate. The compound obtained was reacted with n-butyl<br>
lithium in a solution of di-isopropyl amine in tetrahydrofuran and hexamethyl<br>
phosphoramide and further reacted with carbon dioxide at -75 .degree.. C to give 3-ethoxy-<br>
4-(ethoxy carbonyl)-phenyl acetic acid.	;<br>
One of the steps was performed at very low temperature -75.degree C, which impacted the efficiency of the process as a bottleneck. The recovery and reuse of the solvents tetrahydrofuran and dimethylsufoxide on scale up makes the process cumbersome. A need to develop a more efficient process was felt by the present inventors by overcoming the above said disadvantages.<br>
Journal of Medicinal Chemistry 1998 Vol.41, No.26, 5219 describes the process for the preparation of 3-Ethoxy-4-(ethoxy carbonyl)-phenyl acetic acid which comprises of reacting 2-Hydroxy-4-methyl-benzoic acid with ethyl bromide in the presence of K2CO3 in acetone at 150 °C for 30 hrs to give Ethyl-2-ethoxy-4-methyl-benzoate. The compound obtained was reacted with N-Bromo Succinamide to yield Ethyl-4-bromomethyl-benzoate which was further reacted with sodium cyanide in the presence of N-benzyl-tri-n-butylammonium chloride at 20 °C for 43 hrs to give Ethyl-4-cyanomethyl-2-ethoxy-benzoate. The cyano methyl ester obtained was treated with acid in ethanol which to give Ethyl-2-ethoxy-4-ethoxycarbomethyl-benzoate which was further hydrolyzed to give 3-Ethoxy-4-(ethoxy carbonyl)-phenyl acetic acid.       <br>
US publication 20040249188 discloses the process for the preparation of 3-Ethoxy-4-(alkoxy carbonyl)-phenyl acetic acid which comprises of reacting (2-Hydroxy-4-methyl) benzoic acid with diethyl sulfate using potassium carbonate in toluene to give Ethyl-2-ethoxy-4-methyl-benzoate which was reacted with N-Bromo Succinamide to give Ethyl-4-bromomethyl-2-ethoxy-benzoate. The compound obtained on cyanation yields the cyano compound which on hydrolysis gives the diacid compound. The diacid compound on esterfication in presence of trimethyl amine in toluene to yield Alkyl-2-ethoxy-4-alkoxy carbonyl methyl-benzoate which on further hydrolysis gives 3-Ethoxy-4-(alkoxy carbonyl)-phenyl acetic acid.<br><br>
The process as described above involve use of N-bromosuccinamide as brominating agent which is a costly raw material which gives rise to sudden exotherm in the reaction and leads to chance of runaway reaction during scale up.<br>
These processes also result in low yield with longer reaction time and also with associated<br>
problems in recovery of the solvents used in the reaction such as dichloromethane, being<br>
poor.	,<br>
Another disadvantage is the use of weak bases like potassium carbonate, sodium carbonate, where carbondioxide was produced as by product. Formation of carbon dioxide leads to frothing during scale up which makes the process tedious to operate on industrial scale.<br>
Further, the prior art processes involve an additional extraction step with toluene to remove the inorganic impurities. The prior art processes have another disadvantage that cyclohexane was used with toluene as a solvent system for co-precipitation of the product. Separation of this co-solvent system is an additional step involved in the process with longer hour maintenance reaction of the manufacturing process for production of compound of formula (V).<br>
The methods for synthesis of 3-Ethoxy-4-(ethoxy carbonyl)-phenyl acetic acid of formula (V) as described above in references, Journal of Medicinal Chemistry 1998, Vol. 41, PP. 5219-5246 as well as U.S. patent application No.20040249188 by Reddy, Manne Satyanarayana et.al, December 2004, have limitations as above, which the present inventors have addressed through this invention.<br>
It is, therefore desirable to solve the problems associated with the prior art and to provide an efficient process for the preparation of 3-ethoxy-4- (ethoxy carbonyl)- phenyl acetic acid which improves the economics by employing less expensive and less hazardous raw materials which are easy to handle and is more productive. The process avoids the tedious and cumbersome procedures of recrystallization or purification techniques and is economical and convenient to operate on a commercial scale. Therefore, the process of present invention is cost effective, industrially viable and eco-friendly over prior art procedures.<br><br>
     Objectives of the invention:<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide a simple, commercially viable, efficient and cost effective process for the preparation of 3-Ethoxy-4- (ethoxy carbonyl)-phenyl acetic acid represented by formula (V), which obviates the drawbacks of the prior art processes.<br>

Industrial applicability:<br>
1)	The step (a) for producing compound of formula (I) is completed in 7 to 8 hours as compared to 20 -30 hours mentioned in the prior art process.<br>
2)	In  step  (b)  for  producing  compound  of fomula  (II),  hydrobromic  acid,<br>
hydrochloric acid and sulphuryl chloride are used as a halogenating agent with<br>
 hydrogen peroxide which a cheaper raw material, making the process cost<br>
effective and easy for scale up in plant. Further the run away conditions as<br>
disclosed in prior art are totally eliminated. Use of sulphuryl chloride as<br>
halogenating agent improves space yield of the product during scale up due to<br>
low reaction volumes.<br>
3)	Step (c) for producing compound of formula (III) is performed in 3 hour as compared to 25-35 hour as in prior art.<br>
4)	Further a cheaper phase transfer catalyst and a low volatile solvent such as ethylene dichloride is used as against methylene dichloride in prior art for easy recovery of the solvent which makes the process cost effective.<br>
5)	Ethylene dichloride is used as extracting solvent for removal of impurities in step-(g), which avoids the use of toluene as co solvent for further purification as in the prior art.<br>
