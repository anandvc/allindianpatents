				<td>BACKGROUND Off THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates generally to a colored/tinted contact lens preview device,<br>
and more particularly pertains to a colored tinted contact lens preview device which is a<br>
beauty mirror sales aid to enable a person considering purchasing or wearing colored or<br>
tinted contact lenses to preview a particular color or tint pattern as it would appear as a<br>
colored or tinted contact lens on the eye of that person.<br>
Colored and tinted contact lenses have gained great popularity as a result of the rise in<br>
the general acceptance of contact lenses, greater public sensitivity to personal<br>
appearance and improved contact lens structures (soft contact lenses, oxygen permeable<br>
contact lenses, etc.).<br>
Colored and timed contact lenses can be of two general categories The first category<br>
includes contact lenses which use essentially transparent enhancement colors and allow<br>
the color of the contact lens to augment die natural color of the iris to produce a new<br>
appearance. Such tinted lenses might typically be used to turn a hazel eye to an aqua<br>
colored eye. This class of colored lenses may not be able to change an underlying dark<br>
colored iris to a different color, e.g. a brown iris to blue. The second category includes<br>
an opaque class of tinted lenses in which the color of the contact lens masks the natural<br>
iris color and presents a new color on the outside of the eye. This class of contact lenses<br>
is able to render a brown eye blue, etc.<br>
Presently, parsons fitting colored or tinted contact lens, such as ophthalimologists and<br>
optometrists, have to assist a patient to repeatedly try different tinted contact lenses by<br>
actually inserting, or having the patient insert, each pair into contact with the patient's<br>
eyes so that the patient can see the color which results from the combined tint of the<br><br><br>
contact lens and the patient's natural iris color. And often, previously tried tinted<br>
contact lens have to be retried in order for the patient to make a final decision as to<br>
which tint to order from the many colors which are offered<br>
Ranani U.S. Patent 4,703,964 discloses a tinted contact lens preview device and fitter<br>
having a scissors type support to vary the spacing between pairs of tinted contact lenses<br>
mounted in rotatable discs, or in plug in lens holders, or directly in openings in the<br>
support, so that the centers of the tinted contact lenses can be aligned with the centers of<br>
the patient's pupils in order for the patient to view in a mirror the combined color of the<br>
tinted contact lenses and the color of the patient's irises.<br>
Each pair of lens holders for each different tint must be prepared separately by placing a<br>
tinted contact lens in saline solution in a lens holder and then sealing the lens holder with<br>
a closure. Pairs of lens holders, each containing a pair of soft contact lens of the same<br>
tint, must be prepared for each different available color.<br>
To allow a patient to view different tints to obtain a desired color, an ophthalmologist or<br>
optometrist fitter must place into a lens receptacle different pairs of lens holders<br>
containing tinted contact tenses of different tints, and the patient then looks at the<br>
resulting colors and makes a decision as to which tint to order.<br>
In another embodiment a pair of discs, each including a plurality of mounted tinted<br>
contact lenses, are interchangeably attached to the scissors support so that different<br>
colors may be viewed by rotating the discs or by changing the discs. Each disc has three<br>
U-shaped openings spaced 120 degrees apart Each opening is adapted to receive a<br>
tinted contact lens in a contact lens holder. If the tinted contact lens is a soft contact<br>
lens, it is immersed in a saline solution.<br>
In operation, each of the openings contains a tinted contact lens of a different color, with<br>
pairs of discs having matching tints in corresponding openings. First, the patient, with<br><br><br>
the aid of an ophthalmologist or optometrist fitter, adjusts the angle between the levers<br>
of the scissors support so that the center of the contact lens in each of the vertical top<br>
openings is aligned with the centers of the patient's pupils. Then the resulting combined<br>
color of the tint of the contact lenses and the patient's iris color is examined in a mirror<br>
Then the patient or the fitter rotates the discs together to bring to the vertical top position<br>
a different pair of contact lenses having a matching tint, and checks the resulting<br>
combined color, until a desired tint is determined. Thus each disc permits the viewing of<br>
three different tints. And other pairs of discs, with contacts lenses of still different tints,<br>
can be substituted for the attached pair of discs.<br>
The Ranani approach requires an expensive instrument which uses actual contact lenses<br>
mounted in lens holders, and moreover requires a great deal of time by an<br>
ophthalmologist or optometrist fitter during fitting and trial of different color/tint contact<br>
lenses. The Ranani approach also requires a somewhat cumbersome and time<br>
consuming fitting process which includes placing a pair of colored or tinted contact<br>
lenses into the scissors support, aligning the pair of colored or tinted contact lenses with<br>
the eyes of the patient to view the appearance, aad then removing and replacing the<br>
previous pair of colored or tinted contact lenses with another pair of different colored or<br>
tinted contact lenses, and then repeating the fitting process for each different color or tint<br>
or pattern of interest<br>
Accordingly, it is a primary object of the present invention to provide a colored/tinted<br>
contact lens preview device as a contact lens beauty mirror sales aid which enables a<br>
person considering purchasing or wearing colored or tinted contact lenses to preview a<br>
particular color or tint pattern as it would appear as a colored or timed contact lens on<br>
the eye of that person.<br>
The preview device of the present invention substantially reduces the amount of time<br>
required by an ophthalmologist or optometrist to fit tinted contact lenses, and thus<br><br><br>
reduces the fitting cost, and also provides a preview device for fitting tinted contact<br>
lenses which is relatively inexpensive to construct and easy to use. More specifically,<br>
the preview device of the present invention is sufficiently easy and simple to use and<br>
inexpensive that a person in an ophthalmologist's or optometrist's office can preview<br>
different color and tint contact lenses without requiring the assistance of the<br>
ophthalmologist or optometrist (as in a waiting room).<br>
In accordance with the teachings herein, the present invention provides a colored/tinted<br>
contact lens preview device which is a beauty mirror sales aid to enable a prospective<br>
purchaser or wearer of colored or tinted contact lenses to preview the appearance of<br>
different color or tint patterns of contact lenses as they would appear as a colored or<br>
contact lens on the eye of the person. The preview device comprises a transparent<br>
substrate with a selection of different color or tint circular or annular/toroidal patterns,<br>
each of which simulates a con act lens with that particular color or tint pattern. In usage,<br>
a person views their eye in a mirror with a particular color or tint pattern of interest<br>
superimposed over the eye, such that the preview device simulates the appearance of that<br>
particular color or tint contact lens on the eye of the person.<br><br>

mirror is mounted via adhesive mstde the sleeve as seen on window side to reflect the<br>
user's eyes from a distance of 12-18." The sleeve is spot glued after folding to close in<br>
appropriate locations.<br>
Figure 3 illustrates a second more basic embodiment of the present invention which<br>
comprises only a transparent substrate preview device 40 having a plurality of different<br>
color or tint contact lens simulating patterns 42a - 42g printed thereon with associated<br>
identifier legends 44a - 44g at different positions on the transparent substrate, wherein<br>
the color or tint contact lens simulating patterns 42a - 42g are generally larger than the<br>
corresponding patterns 14a - 14g of the embodiment of Figures 1 and 2. The preview<br>
housing preferably includes a downwardly extending handle 46 for ease of handling and<br>
usage. In usage, a previewing person holds the transparent substrate in front of a<br>
selected eye such that a selected color or tint contact tens simulating pattern of interest is<br>
positioned in front of the eye while the person is spaced a suitable distance (e.g. 1 -3<br>
feet) from an external mirror 48. The arrangement is such that the person can view the<br>
appearance of a particular selected color or tint contact lens pattern of interest 42 on the<br>
eye, and by moving the preview device slightly can compare the appearance of the<br>
person's natural eye color with the selected color or tint contact lens simulating pattern<br>
The previewing person can also selectively move the preview device to position any one<br>
of the plurality of different color or tint contact lens simulating patterns 42a - 42g in<br>
front of the eye to compare and evaluate each different contact lens simulating pattern in<br>

annular/ toroidal shaped green opaque pattern (14a), an annular/toroidal<br>
shaped honey opaque (14b) pattern, an annular/toroidal shaped blue<br>
opaque (14c) pattern, an annular/toroidal shaped gray opaque pattern<br>
(14d), a circular shaped aqua enhancer (14e) pattern, a circular shaped<br>
blue enhancer pattern (14f)/ and a circular shaped green enhancer<br>
pattern (14g).<br>
19.The preview device as claimed in claim 1, comprising a transparent<br>
substrate preview device (40) having a plurality of different color or tint<br>
contact lens simulating patterns (42a to 42g) printed substrate (12), such<br>
that a previewing person holds the transparent substrate (12) in front of a<br>
selected eye such a selected color or tint contact lens simulating pattern<br>
of interest (42) is positioned in front of the eye while the person is spaced<br>
a spaced a distance from an external mirror (48), such that a person can<br>
view the appearance of a particular selected color or tint contact lens<br>
pattern of interest (42) on the eye, and by moving the preview device<br>
(40) slightly can compare the appearance of the person's natural eye color<br>
with the selected color or tint contact lens simulating patterns (42a to<br>
42g) and the previewing person can also selectively move the preview<br>
device (40) to position any one of the plurality of different color or tint<br>
contact lens simulating pattern in turn.<br><br>
This invention relates to a colored/tinted contact lens preview device (10) which<br>
enables a prospective wearer of colored or tinted contact to preview the<br>
appearance of different color or tint patterns of contact lenses as they would<br>
appear as a colored or tinted contact lens on the eye of the person, comprising a<br>
transparent substrate (12) having a selection of different color or tint contact<br>
lens simulating patterns (14a to 14g) thereon, each of which simulates a contact<br>
lens with that particular color or tint pattern, such that when a person views their<br>
eye in a mirror (20) with a particular color or tint pattern of interest<br>
superimposed over the eye, the preview devices simulates the appearance of<br>
that particular color or tint contact lens on the eye of the person.</td>
