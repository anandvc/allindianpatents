				<td>The invention relates to a buttonhole sewing machineaccording to the pre--<br>
amble of claim 1<br>
The JUKI MEB-3200 Instruction Manual leaflet no. 02 29343316 describes<br>
a buttonhole sewing machine of the generic type. It comprises an x-<br>
y table which is displaceable on the sewing plane by two stepper motors as<br>
x and y drives. Two work piece clamps are disposed on the x-y table, holding<br>
a work piece thereon. By means of a pneumatic cylinder, they are displaceable<br>
in the x direction on the sewing plane, which is formed by the x-<br>
y plane, in mirror symmetry to a center plane. Both pneumatic cylinders<br>
are operable by means of a control command that is stored in the control<br>
unit. Provided on each side of the x-y table are setscrews, enabling the<br>
length of spread of each work piece clamp to be set from a non-modifiable<br>
inner initial position of spread to a final position of spread.<br>
Shifting the work piece clamps enables the tightly clamped work piece to<br>
be stretched and spread into a tautened plain position. It is possible in this<br>
way to produce high quality buttonholes. Spreading the work piece also<br>
creates sufficient room for the needle, in case the buttonhole is first cut and<br>
then sewn i.e., with the sewing machine working in a so-called preconditioning<br>
mode. The displacement of each work piece clamp is in the<br>
range of 1.0 mm so that the clamps can be moved apart by a length of<br>
spread of 2.0 mm. The length of spread depends on various sewing parameters<br>
such as the structure of the work piece i.e., material, thickness and<br>
the like, the kind of threads used for sewing, thread tightening, needle size,<br>
possible use of a gimp thread and further parameters.<br>
Drawbacks of this known machine reside in that the work piece clamps<br>
must be made rather solid; if not, they would be warped by the clamping<br>
forces that occur. Considerable frictional forces occur upon spreading,<br>
which must be overcome by the displacement drive for execution of the<br>
spreading motion.<br>
It is an object of the invention to develop a buttonhole sewing machine of<br>
the generic type for as simple a design as possible of the at least one work<br>
piece clamp.<br>
According to the invention, this object is attained by the features of the<br>
characterizing part of claim 1<br>
invention disclosed hereunder .<br>
The measures according to the invention help ensure that, at least by the<br>
displaceable work piece clamp, no forces are transmitted to the guides of<br>
the work piece clamp on the x-y table. No frictional forces that might oppose<br>
the displacement of the work piece clamp for spreading are occasioned<br>
in positioning the work piece clamp. The forces that occasion when<br>
a work piece is clamped are kept within the work piece clamp itself. This<br>
works in favor of the rapidity and accuracy of the spreading job. Lightweight<br>
construction of the entire spreading arrangement is possible, reducing<br>
material consumption.<br>
Advantageous embodiments will become apparent from the sub-claims.<br>

as opposed to Fig. 2;<br>

Fig. 11 is an illustration, partially broken open, of details of another embodiment<br>
of a sewing machine on an enlarged scale as compared to<br>
Fig. 1; and<br>
Fig. 12 is a plan view of the part of the sewing machine seen in Fig. 11 on<br>
the line XII-XIIofFig. 11.<br>
As seen in Fig. 1, a buttonhole sewing machine is C shaped, having a top<br>
arm 1, a bottom base plate 2 in the form of a casing and an approximately<br>
vertical standard 3 that unites the two. An arm shaft 4 is conventionally<br>
lodged in the arm 1; it is drivable by a motor 5 which is only roughly outlined<br>
in Fig. 8. The actuation of a vertically displaceable needle bar 6 with<br>
a needle 7 and a jogging drive therefor customarily derive from the arm<br>
shaft 4.<br>
Disposed on the base plate 2 is an x-y table 8 which is a cross slide that is<br>
movable in two horizontal coordinate directions, namely the x and the y<br>
direction. The x-y table 8 is of conventional design as known for example<br>
from DE 198 07 771 Al (corresponding to U.S. patent 6 095 066). Actuation<br>
of the x-y table 8 takes place by drives roughly outlined only in Fig. 8,<br>
namely an x drive 9 and a y drive 10, which are electric positioning motors,<br>
preferably stepper motors, or controllable D.C. motors.<br>
A two-piece supporting plate 11a, 11b is disposed on the x-y table 8. The<br>
sectional supporting plate 1 la on the left- seen in the y direction - is fixed<br>
to the x-y table 8 by positioning devices 12, 12'. The positioning devices<br>
12, 12' are formed by recesses in the sectional supporting plate 1 la and by<br>
pins which are tightly mounted on the x-y table 8. The sectional supporting<br>
plate 1 la is non-displaceable in relation to the x-y table 8. The sectional<br>
supporting plate 11 b on the right — seen in the y direction — is supported for<br>
displacement in the x direction on the x-y table 8. The top surfaces of the<br>
sectional supporting plates lla, lib are on a joint x-y plane.<br>
Mounted on each sectional supporting plate lla and 1 lb is a work piece<br>
clamp 13a and 13b, comprising a sectional bearing plate 14a and 14b<br>
which is mounted on the respective sectional supporting plate 1 la and 1 lb<br>
and to each of which is allocated a clamping plate 15a and 15b. The clamping<br>
plates 15a, 15b are mounted on double-armed bearing levers 16a, 16b.<br>
Each double-armed bearing lever 16a, 16b is lodged in a drive and bearing<br>
housing 18a, 18b by means of a pivot bearing 17a, 17b. The housing 18a,<br>
18b is tightly fixed to the underside of the supporting plate 1 lb by screws<br>
19, the contact areas of both components being tightly fitted to each other<br>
in a manner impervious to compressed air by a liquid sealant (not shown).<br>
The work piece clamp 13b will be described in detail below.<br>
The housing 18b includes a continuous cylindrical chamber 20, which is<br>
open downwards and closed upwards by the supporting plate 11b, with a<br>
piston 21 disposed therein for sealed upward and downward reciprocating<br>
motion. This piston 21 has a piston rod 22 which stands out downwards<br>
from the cylindrical chamber 20 and is articulated by a hinge 23 to the corresponding<br>
end 24 of the bearing lever 16b. A compressed-air duct 25 is<br>
formed in the housing 18b by the side of the cylindrical chamber 20 and,<br>
on the upper side of the housing 18b, is connected to the cylindrical chamber<br>
20 by an overflow duct 26. On the lower side of the housing 18b, a<br>
compressed-air line 27 opens into the compressed-air duct 25; the compressed-air<br>
line 27 is connected to an electromechanically operated 3/2-port<br>
directional control valve 28', a so-called solenoid valve. The described unit<br>
in the form of a unilaterally pneumatically actuated piston-cylinder unit<br>
constitutes a clamping drive 28b.<br>
In the housing 18b, a hole 29 is provided by the side of the compressed-air<br>
duct 25 with a pre-loaded extension spring 30 disposed therein, which is<br>
fixed in place by a detaining pin 31 on the upper side of the housing 18b<br>
and by another detaining pin 32 on the bearing lever 16. By means of the<br>
pre-loaded extension spring 30, the bottom lever portion 33, between the<br>
pivot bearing 17b and the hinge 23, is pulled upwards towards the clamping<br>
drive 28b so that the top lever portion 34 of the bearing lever 16b is<br>
pivoted upwards i.e., the clamping plate 15b is lifted off the supporting<br>
plate 11b. If, however, compressed air flows into the chamber 20 above the<br>
piston 21 via the compressed-air line 27, the compressed-air duct 25 and<br>
the overflow duct 26, the piston 21, together with the bottom lever portion<br>
33, is displaced downwards against the force of the extension spring 30 so<br>
that the top lever portion 34 and the clamping plate 15b are pivoted towards<br>
the supporting plate 1 lb, thereby possibly clamping a work piece 35.<br>
A setscrew 36 is disposed in the bottom lever portion 33, bearing against<br>
the housing 18b and serving for adjustment of the length by which the<br>
clamping plate 15b is lifted off the bearing plate 14b.<br>
Arranging the clamping drive 28b between the bearing lever 16b and the<br>
supporting plate 11b ensures that the forces that act within the work piece<br>
clamp 13b are kept within the clamp 13b and do not act on the x-y table 8.<br>
The other supporting plate 11a and the work piece clamp 13a are embodied<br>
in like manner.<br>
In a zero position, the sectional supporting plates 11a, 11b are symmetrical<br>
to a center plane 37 so that opposite edges 38a, 38b of the bearing plates<br>
14a, 14b have a distance z of for instance 6 millimeters between them. In<br>
this plane 37, a stationary knife 39 for buttonhole-40 cutting is arranged on<br>
the base plate 2 of the sewing machine. This knife 39 is part of a cutting<br>
device 41 which also includes an anvil 42 which is movable by a cutting<br>
drive 43, reciprocating up and down on the bottom side of the arm 1.<br>
A design of a displacement drive for the sectional supporting plate 11b will<br>
become apparent from Figs. 6, 7. The sectional supporting plate 1 lb is<br>
guided for displacement directly on the x-y table 8. A pneumatically actuated<br>
displacement drive 44 is fixed to the x-y table 8 underneath the supporting<br>
plate 1 lb. It is coupled with a lever arrangement 45 which confers<br>
the shifting motions to the sectional supporting plate 1 lb. To this end, a<br>
first lever 46 and a second lever 47, which are both double-armed levers,<br>
are pivotably housed by their central portion in bearings 48 which are<br>
formed on the x-y table 8. The levers 46, 47 overlap one another at their<br>
ends turned towards each other; these ends have U-shaped recesses that run<br>
in the lengthwise direction of the levers 46, 47 (Fig. 6). This is where a bolt<br>
49 passes through; the bolt 49 is provided on the drive 44 which is perpendicular<br>
to the principal direction of the levers 46, 47. The bolt 49 is<br>
mounted on a piston rod 50 of the drive 44, the piston rod 50 being joined<br>
to the piston 51 of the drive 44. The piston 51 is displaceably disposed in<br>
the interior space 52 of the casing 53 of the drive 44. A compressed-air<br>
supply line 54 with an electromechanically actuated 3/2-port direction control<br>
valve 44' located therein opens into the space 52.<br>
The ends of the levers 46, 47 that face away from each other are provided<br>
with a pin 55, one pin 55 reaching into an oblong hole 56 and the other pin<br>
55 into a circular hole 56' in the sectional supporting plate 1 lb. A preloaded<br>
extension spring 57, which is connected with the x-y table 8, acts on<br>
the end, neighboring the pin 55, of the second lever 47.<br>
When the displacement drive 44 is actuated by compressed air, then the<br>
bolt 49 and the two ends, coupled therewith, of the levers 46, 47 are displaced<br>
counter to the x direction, as a result of which the sectional supporting<br>
plate 1 lb is shifted in the x direction against the pre-load of the extension<br>
spring 57. Upon pressure relief of the displacement drive 44, the sectional<br>
supporting plate 1 lb is restored by the extension spring 57 counter to<br>
the x direction.<br>
Attached to the x-y table 8 is a first setscrew 58 as an adjustable stop, by<br>
means of which to define and set a first stop position of the sectional supporting<br>
plate 1 lb in the x direction. A second setscrew 59 is provided as an<br>
adjustable stop on the displacement drive 44, defining the restoring path of<br>
the piston 51 in the x direction, which again defines a second stop position<br>
of the sectional supporting plate 11 counter to the x direction. The two set-<br>
screws 58, 59 serve to define the stop positions and thus the length of displacement<br>
of the sectional supporting plate 11b.<br>
The sectional supporting plate 11b, which is made of steel, is secured on<br>
the x-y table 8 in the vertical direction by engaging from below with a nose<br>
60b on one side while being held by permanent magnets 61 on the side<br>
neighboring the extension spring 57. The sectional supporting plate 1 la is<br>
likewise held on the x-y table 8 by a nose 60a and corresponding permanent<br>
magnets.<br>
The sewing machine is provided with a control unit 62, by way of which<br>
are triggered the x drive 9, the y drive 10, the valve 44' for the displacement<br>
drive 44, the driving motor 5 of the arm shaft 4, the clamping drives<br>
28a, 28b and the cutting drive 43. The control unit 62 includes a memory<br>
unit 63. An operating unit 64 with a keyboard 65 and a display 66 are allocated<br>
to the control unit 62.<br>
Programs and data are stored in the memory unit 63, relating to a buttonhole<br>
seam 67 that is going to be produced. Ranges of values are stored for<br>
the distance z; they are allocated to the final positions of spread which are<br>
to be taken by the sectional supporting plate 1 lb.<br>
Before a sewing job is started, the x-y table 8 is conventionally moved, in<br>
accordance with the data stored in the memory unit 63, into the zero position<br>
by the drives 9, 10 in the form of stepper motors; in the zero position<br>
the center plane 37 also accommodates the needle 7 in its vertical central<br>
position. Zero positioning of this type is general practice in sewing control<br>
technique and does not require any further explanation. By corresponding<br>
actuation of the operating unit 34, the operator selects a certain type of buttonhole<br>
40 with a buttonhole seam 67.<br>
This is followed by an adjustment job made by the operator for the spreading<br>
motion. To this end, a certain key of a keyboard 65 is operated in the<br>
operating unit 64, by which to move the sectional supporting plate 11 b alternately<br>
into the first or second stop position. It is thus possible to adjust<br>
the respectively unloaded setscrew 58 or 59. This job is repeated until the<br>
given values of the distance z can be measured at the edges 38a, 38b of the<br>
bearing plates 14a, 14b by the aid of a slide gauge.<br>
The adjustment job is accompanied with a transfer, by the operator, of<br>
given data of spread to the displacement drive 44 which positions the sectional<br>
supporting plate 11b. In the reverse case it is also possible, in the<br>
memory unit 63, to store data of spread i.e., values for the stop positions of<br>
the sectional supporting plate 11b, that have been determined empirically.<br>
After termination of the adjustment job, a key of the operating unit 64 is<br>
actuated and, by the displacement drive 44 being triggered, the sectional<br>
supporting plate 1 lb and the work piece clamp 13b are moved into an initial<br>
position of spread in which the longitudinal edges 38a, 38b, defining<br>
the sectional openings 68a, 68b, of the clamping plates 15a, 15b have a<br>
distance a, corresponding to the distance z, from each other that corresponds<br>
to the total width b of the buttonhole seam 67 plus a distance c of<br>
for instance 0.5 mm between the buttonhole seam 67 and each neighboring<br>
longitudinal edge 38a and 38b.<br>
Then the operator releases the work piece clamps 13a, 13b via the operating<br>
unit 64 or automatically in accordance with the stored sewing program;<br>
the operator may then place and align the work piece 35 on the bearing<br>
plates 14a, 14b. Subsequently, the work piece clamps 13a, 13b are closed<br>
by corresponding triggering of valves 28' for actuation of the clamping<br>
drives 28a and 28b so that the work piece 35 is clamped by both work<br>
piece clamps 13a, 13b. Afterwards, displacement of the sectional supporting<br>
plate 11b, together with the work piece clamp 13b, in the x direction by<br>
the length of spread d that results from the set stop positions takes place<br>
fully automatically by means of the displacement drive 44 which is triggered<br>
by the control unit 62. Simultaneously or directly afterwards, the x-y<br>
table 8 is moved by a length d/2 in the reversed direction so that the two<br>
bearing plates 14a, 14b are in their final position of spread again in mirror<br>
symmetry to the center plane 37. As a result, the sectional openings 68a,<br>
68b are again in mirror symmetry to the center plane 37. The clamped and<br>
spread work piece 3 5 is positioned underneath the needle 6 in a position<br>
that is precisely defined for execution of the sewing operation. Solid lines<br>
in Fig. 9 illustrate the initial position of the clamping plate 15b and dashed<br>
lines show the position of spread after displacement of the sectional supporting<br>
plate 11b by the length of spread d but prior to compensation<br>
through reversal of the x-y table 8 by half the length of spread d/2. Cutting<br>
the buttonhole 40 by means of the knife 39 may take place prior to the but-<br>
tonhole-40 sewing job or afterwards. As seen in Fig. 10, the buttonhole<br>
seam 67 is a conventional flat stitch seam produced by a corresponding<br>
needle jogging drive of the needle bar 6. Stay stitches (not shown) may be<br>
sewn additionally at the end of the buttonhole seam 67 that is opposite the<br>
buttonhole eye 70.<br>
Figs. 11 and 12 illustrate an alternative embodiment for displacing the supporting<br>
plate 1 lb. In this case, a carrier plate 72, which carries the supporting<br>
plate 1 lb, is displaceably supported by a ball bearing guide 71. The<br>
carrier plate 72, along with the sectional supporting plate 1 lb, is displace-<br>
able in the x direction by means of a displacement drive 73 in the form of a<br>
stepper motor. This drive 73 is mounted on the x-y table 8, acting on the<br>
carrier plate 72 via a cam 75 that is mounted on its shaft 74 and a fulcrum<br>
slide connection 76 that cooperates with the cam 75, so that maximal displacements<br>
of the carrier plate 72 in the x direction are possible, corresponding<br>
to twice the eccentricity of the cam 75. The displacement lengths<br>
are in the range of approximately 2 mm. The spreading operation takes<br>
place as specified above; the length of spread d is controlled by data deposited<br>
in the memory unit 63.<br>
