				<td>BELT TYPE CONTINOUSLY VARIABLE TRANSMISSION AND STRADDLE TYPE<br>
VEHICLE<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a belt type continuously<br>
variable transmission and a straddle type vehicle having the<br>
belt type continuously variable transmission.<br>
2.	Description of the Related Art<br>
Conventionally, straddle type vehicles having the belt<br>
type continuously variable transmission are known. The belt<br>
type continuously variable transmission has a primary sheave<br>
to which the driving force from an engine is transmitted and<br>
a secondary sheave to which the driving force is transmitted<br>
from the primary sheave via a V-belt. In the belt type<br>
continuously variable transmission, a speed reduction ratio<br>
varies in accordance with respective changes of a winding<br>
radius of the belt in the primary sheave and a winding radius<br>
of the V-belt in the secondary sheave.<br>
In the meantime, if the V-belt is made of rubber, the V-belt<br>
is likely to wear to reduce durability. Also, due to heat<br>
generation following deformation of the V-belt, there can be<br>
another problem such that the V-belt is likely to deteriorate.<br>
Therefore, an idea in which a resin block belt made of coupled<br>
multiple resin blocks is used as the belt type continuously<br>
1<br><br>
variable transmission is proposed (See JP-A-2002-147553, for<br>
example).<br>
In the belt type continuously variable transmission having<br>
the resin block belt, the belt itself hardly wear. However<br>
there arises, to the contrary, another problem such that<br>
surfaces of the sheaves are likely to wear. Thus,<br>
JP-A-2002-147553 (see Page 2, the right column, lines 34 to<br>
38) proposes that the respective surfaces of the primary sheave<br>
and the secondary sheave are plated with chrome.<br>
The resin block belt has some extent of strength. However,<br>
it was revealed that, if the respective surfaces of the primary<br>
sheave and the secondary sheave are plated with chrome, wear<br>
of the resin block belt increases. As thus discussed, it was<br>
difficult, according to the conventional art, to highly<br>
compatibly ensure both of the prevention of wear of the V-belt<br>
and the prevention of wear of the sheaves.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is made under the circumstances, and<br>
an object of the present invention is to highly compatibly<br>
ensure both of prevention of wear of a V-belt and prevention<br>
of wear of sheaves.<br>
The inventors made every effort in their researches to<br>
achieve the object and paid attention to a difference between<br>
contact pressures (sheave thrust/ contact area) of the sheave<br>
2<br><br>
surfaces of the primary sheave and the secondary sheave.<br>
That is, in consideration of the primary sheave first, as<br>
shown in FIG. 10 (a) , if an engine speed is low (in other words,<br>
if a rotational speed of the primary sheave 71 is low), the<br>
speed reduction ratio of the belt type continuously variable<br>
transmission becomes large and a winding radius rl of the V-belt<br>
73 in the primary sheave 71 becomes relatively small.<br>
Accordingly, a contact area S1 between the primary sheave 71<br>
and the V-belt 73 also becomes relatively small. Meanwhile,<br>
if the engine speed is low, the driving force (= sheave thrust)<br>
transmitted from the primary sheave 71 to the V-belt 73 is<br>
relatively small. Thus, the contact pressure of the sheave<br>
surface of the primary sheave 71 is not so large.<br>
On the other hand, if the engine speed is high, the driving<br>
force transmitted from the primary sheave 71 to the V-belt 73<br>
is relatively large. However, as shown in FIG. 10 (b) , if the<br>
engine speed is high, the speed reduction ratio becomes small<br>
and the winding radius rl of the V-belt 73 in the primary sheave<br>
71 becomes relatively large. Accordingly, the contact area<br>
SI between the primary sheave 71 and the V-belt 73 becomes<br>
relatively large. Therefore, even though the engine speed is<br>
high, the contact pressure of the sheave surface of the primary<br>
sheave 71 is not so large.<br>
To the contrary, the secondary sheave may have the<br>
following situations. That is, as shown in FIG. 10 (a) , if the<br>
3<br><br>
engine speed is low, the speed reduction ratio becomes large<br>
and a winding radius r2 of the V-belt 73 in the secondary sheave<br>
72 becomes relatively large. Accordingly, a contact area S2<br>
between the secondary sheave 72 and the V-belt 73 also becomes<br>
relatively large. Meanwhile, if the engine speed is low, the<br>
driving force transmitted from the V-belt 73 to the secondary<br>
sheave 72 becomes relatively small. Thus, the contact<br>
pressure of the sheave surface of the secondary sheave 72<br>
becomes relatively small.<br>
On the other hand, as shown in FIG. 10(b), if the engine<br>
speed is high, the speed reduction ratio becomes small and the<br>
winding radius r2 of the V-belt 73 in the secondary sheave 72<br>
becomes relatively small. Accordingly, the contact area S2<br>
between the secondary sheave 72 and the V-belt 73 also becomes<br>
relatively small. Meanwhile, if the engine speed is high, the<br>
driving force transmitted from the V-belt 73 to the secondary<br>
sheave 72 becomes relatively large. Thus, if the engine speed<br>
is high, the contact pressure of the sheave surface of the<br>
secondary sheave 72 becomes relatively large.<br>
That is, in the primary sheave, the contact pressure does<br>
not become so large even though the engine speed varies. To<br>
the contrary, it is conceivable that, in the secondary sheave,<br>
the contact pressure becomes very large under the condition<br>
that the engine speed is large (i.e., at the so-called top<br>
speed).  From such analyses, the inventors realize that it is<br>
4<br><br>
important to prevent wear of the belt in the secondary sheave<br>
at the top speed.<br>
Also, the inventors realize the following facts as<br>
different points between the primary sheave and the secondary<br>
sheave. That is, because the primary sheave transmits the<br>
driving force from the engine to the V-belt, the primary sheave<br>
is likely to be affected by fluctuations of the engine speed.<br>
To the contrary, the driving force from the engine is<br>
transmitted to the secondary sheave via the V-belt. Therefore,<br>
the secondary sheave is hardly affected by the fluctuations<br>
of the engine speed in comparison with the primary sheave.<br>
From such analyses, the inventors realize that both of<br>
prevention of wear of the belt and prevention of wear of the<br>
sheaves are highly compatibly ensured by making the surface<br>
hardness of the secondary sheave less than the surface hardness<br>
of the primary sheave. The inventors, thus, made the following<br>
invention.<br>
That is, the belt type continuously variable transmission<br>
according to the present invention includes a primary sheave<br>
to which the driving force from an engine is transmitted, a<br>
secondary sheave, and a V-belt wound around the primary sheave<br>
and the secondary sheave, the V-belt having a contact part<br>
contacting with the primary sheave and the secondary sheave,<br>
and at least a portion of the contact part being made of resin.<br>
The surface hardness of the contact part of the secondary sheave<br>
5<br><br>
contacting with the V-belt is lower than the surface hardness<br>
of a contact part of the primary sheave contacting with the<br>
V-belt.<br>
According to the above belt type continuously variable<br>
transmission, the surface hardness of the contact portion of<br>
the secondary sheave is relatively low. Even though the belt<br>
type continuously variable transmission is at the top speed<br>
where the contact pressure becomes large, the V-belt in the<br>
secondary sheave can be prevented from wearing. Meanwhile,<br>
because the secondary sheave is hardly affected by the<br>
fluctuations, the secondary sheave does not remarkably wear<br>
in comparison with the primary sheave even the surface hardness<br>
of the secondary sheave is relatively low. Accordingly, both<br>
of the prevention of the wear of the V-belt and the prevention<br>
of the wear of the sheaves can be highly compatibly ensured.<br>
As thus discussed, according to the present invention, in<br>
the belt type continuously variable transmission, both of the<br>
prevention of the wear of the V-belt and the prevention of the<br>
wear of the sheaves can be highly compatibly ensured.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br><embodiment><br>
Hereunder, an embodiment of the present invention will be<br>
described based upon the accompanying drawings.<br>
As shown in FIG. 1, a straddle type vehicle according to<br>
this embodiment is a motorcycle 10. The motorcycle 10 has a<br>
vehicle frame 11 forming a framework and a seat 16 on which<br>
a rider sits. The motorcycle 10 is the so-called moped type<br>
motorcycle. However, the straddle type vehicle according to<br>
the present invention can be motorcycles other than the moped<br>
type (such as, for example, motorcycle type and scooter type<br>
motorcycles) or straddle type vehicles other than motorcycles<br>
(such as, for example, ATVs).<br>
In the following descriptions, the fore to aft and lateral<br>
directions mean directions which the rider sitting on the seat<br>
16 perceives. The vehicle frame 11 includes a steering head<br>
pipe 12, a single main frame 13 extending obliquely downward<br>
rearward from the steering head pipe 12, a left and right pair<br>
of seat rails 14L (see FIG. 2) , 14R extending obliquely upward<br>
rearward from a mid portion of the main frame 13, and left and<br>
right seat pillar tubes 15L, 15R connected to a rear end portion<br>
of the main frame 13 and mid portions of the seat rails 14L,<br>
14R.<br>
A vehicle cover 21 covers top and lateral sides of the<br>
8<br><br>
vehicle frame 11. A space 17 recessed downward in the side<br>
elevational view is defined above the vehicle cover 21 and in<br>
front of the seat 16. Also, a center tunnel lla through which<br>
the main frame 13 extends is defined under the vehicle cover<br>
21.<br>
The steering head pipe 12 supports a front wheel 19 via<br>
a front fork 18. The seat rails 14L, 14R support a fuel tank<br>
20 and the seat 16 thereabove. The seat 16 extends from an<br>
upper location of the fuel tank 20 toward rear ends of the seat<br>
rails 14L, 14R. The fuel tank 20 is disposed above top surfaces<br>
of respective front half portions of the seat rails 14L, 14R<br>
and is covered with the vehicle cover 21 and the seat 16.<br>
A first pair of left and right engine brackets 22L, 22R<br>
(see FIGs. 3 and 4) protrude downward from the mid portion of<br>
the main frame 13. The rear end portion of the main frame 13<br>
has a second pair of left and right engine brackets 23L, 23R<br>
(see FIG. 5) and a pair of left and right rear arm brackets<br>
24L, 24R (see FIGs. 3 and 4).<br>
The rear arm brackets 24L, 24R protrude downward from the<br>
rear end portion of the main frame 13. The rear arm brackets<br>
24L, 24R have a pivot shaft 38. As shown in FIG. 1, the pivot<br>
shaft 38 pivotally carries a front end portion of a rear arm<br>
25.	A rear end portion of the rear arm 25 supports a rear wheel<br>
26.	The vehicle frame 11 suspends the rear half of the rear<br>
arm 25 via cushion units 27.<br>
9<br><br>
As shown in FIG. 5, the second paired brackets 23L, 23R<br>
protrude downward from the rear end portion of the main frame<br>
13. The second pair of left and right engine brackets 23L,<br>
23R are spaced apart from each other and oppose each other in<br>
a width direction of the vehicle.<br>
As shown in FIG. 1, the vehicle frame 11 supports an engine<br>
unit 28 driving the rear wheel 26. Specifically, as shown in<br>
FIG. 4, the engine unit 28 includes a crankcase 35, a cylinder<br>
43 and a cylinder head 44 . The crankcase 35 has first and second<br>
engine mount sections 36, 37. The respective first engine<br>
mount sections 36 protrude upward from a top side of a front<br>
end portion of the crankcase 35 and are supported by the first<br>
engine brackets 22L, 22R. The respective engine mount<br>
sections 37 protrude obliquely upward rearward from a top side<br>
of a rear end portion of the crankcase 35 and are supported<br>
by the second paired engine brackets 23L, 23R (see FIG. 5 also) .<br>
The crankcase 35 thus depends from the main frame 13.<br>
The engine unit 28 includes an engine 29 and a belt type<br>
continuously variable transmission (hereunder, called CVT) 30<br>
(see FIG. 6), details of which will be described later.<br>
Although the engine 2 9 is not limited to any types, the engine<br>
29 in this embodiment is a four-stroke, single cylinder engine.<br>
As shown in FIG. 1, the motorcycle 10 includes a front<br>
fender 31 covering a top side and a rear side of the front wheel<br>
19 and a rear fender 32 covering a portion of the rear wheel<br>
10<br><br>
28 between top and rear sides thereof. Also, the motorcycle<br>
10 includes a front cowling 33 and lateral leg shields 34L,<br>
34R (see FIG. 2) in addition to the vehicle cover 21.<br>
As shown in FIG. 2, footrests 85L, 85R made of rubber or<br>
the like are disposed on the left and right sides of the engine<br>
unit 28. The crankcase 35 of the engine unit 28 supports the<br>
left and right footrests 85L, 85R via a coupling bar 87 made<br>
of metal and an attaching plate 88 (see FIGs. 3 and 4) fixed<br>
to the coupling bar 87.<br>
As shown in FIGs. 1 and 2, a brake pedal 84 is disposed<br>
in front of the footrest 85R on the right side. The brake pedal<br>
84 extends below a transmission case 53 and projects obliquely<br>
forward on the right side. The brake pedal 84 also extends<br>
obliquely upward forwardly on the right side of the<br>
transmission case 53. As shown in FIG. 2, when the motorcycle<br>
10 runs, the right foot 62a of the rider is positioned next<br>
to the transmission case 53 in the width direction of the<br>
vehicle.<br>
Next, an internal structure of the engine unit 28 will be<br>
described. As shown in FIG. 6, the engine unit 28 includes<br>
the engine 29, the CVT 30, a centrifugal clutch 41 and a<br>
reduction gear mechanism 42.<br>
The engine 29 includes the crankcase 35, the cylinder 43<br>
coupled with the crankcase 35 and the cylinder head 44 coupled<br>
with the cylinder 43. The crankcase 35 has divided two case<br>
11<br><br>
blocks, i.e., a first case block 35a positioned on the left<br>
side and a second case block 35b positioned on the right side.<br>
The first case block 35a and the second case block 35b oppose<br>
each other in the width direction of the vehicle.<br>
The crankcase 35 contains a crankshaft 4 6 therein. The<br>
crankshaft 4 6 extends in the width direction of the vehicle<br>
to be disposed horizontally. The crankshaft 46 is journaled<br>
by the first case block 35a via a bearing 47 and the second<br>
case block 35b via a bearing 48.<br>
A piston 50 is slidably disposed within the cylinder 43.<br>
One end of a connecting rod 51 is coupled with the piston 50.<br>
A crank pin 59 is disposed between a left side crank arm 46a<br>
and a right side crank arm 4 6b. The other end of the connecting<br>
rod 51 is coupled with the crank pin 59.<br>
A recessed portion 44a and intake ports (not shown) and<br>
exhaust ports (not shown) both communicating with the recessed<br>
portion 44a are defined in the cylinder head 44. An ignition<br>
plug 55 is inserted into the recessed portion 44a of the<br>
cylinder head 44. As shown in FIG. 3, intake pipes 52a are<br>
connected to the intake ports, while exhaust pipes 52 are<br>
connected to the exhaust ports. As shown in FIGs. 1 and 2,<br>
the exhaust pipes 52 extend from the cylinder head 44 rearward<br>
and obliquely downward on the right side and further extend<br>
rearward below the transmission case 53. The exhaust pipes<br>
52 are then connected to a muffler placed on the right side<br>
12<br><br>
of the rear wheel 26.<br>
As shown in FIG. 6, a cam chain chamber 56 is defined in<br>
the inside of the cylinder 43 on the left side thereof to connect<br>
the inside of the crankcase 35 and the inside of the cylinder<br>
head 44. A timing chain 57 is disposed in the cam chain chamber<br>
56. The timing chain 57 is wound around the crankshaft 46 and<br>
the camshaft 58. The camshaft 58 rotates with the rotation<br>
of the crankshaft 46 to move each of intake valves and exhaust<br>
valves, which are not shown, between an open position and a<br>
closed position.<br>
A generator case 66 containing a generator 63 is detachably<br>
mounted to a left side of a front half of the first case block<br>
35a. The transmission case 53 containing the CVT 30 is mounted<br>
to a right side of the second case block 35b.<br>
An opening is defined in a right side surface of a rear<br>
half of the second case block 35b. A clutch cover 60 closes<br>
the opening. The clutch cover 60 is detachably fixed to the<br>
second case block 35b by bolts 61.<br>
The transmission case 53 is formed independently from the<br>
crankcase 35. The transmission case 53 includes an inner case<br>
53a covering an inner side (left side) of the CVT 30 in the<br>
width direction of the vehicle and an outer case 53b covering<br>
an outer side (right side) of the CVT 30 in the width direction<br>
of the vehicle. The inner case 53a is attached to a right<br>
surface of the crankcase 35, while the outer case 53b is<br>
13<br><br>
attached to a right surface of the inner case 53a. A belt<br>
chamber 67 is defined inside of the inner case 53a and the outer<br>
case 53b to contain the CVT 30 therein.<br>
As shown in FIG. 6, a right end portion of the crankshaft<br>
46 extends to the belt chamber 67 through the second case block<br>
35b and the inner case 53a. A primary sheave 71 of the CVT<br>
30 is fitted onto the right end portion of the crankshaft 46.<br>
The primary sheave 71 thus rotates with the rotation of the<br>
crankshaft 46. A right portion of the crankshaft 46 (strictly,<br>
a portion positioned on the right side of the bearing 48) forms<br>
a primary sheave shaft 4 6c.<br>
On the other hand, the left end portion of the crankshaft<br>
46 extends into the generator case 66 through the first case<br>
block 35a. The generator 63 is mounted to the left end portion<br>
of the crankshaft 46. The generator 63 includes a stator 64<br>
and a rotor opposing the stator 64. The rotor 65 is fixed to<br>
a sleeve 74 rotating together with the crankshaft 46. The<br>
stator 64 is fixed to the generator case 66.<br>
A secondary sheave shaft 62 is disposed in the rear half<br>
of the crankcase 35 to extend parallel to the crankshaft 46.<br>
As shown in FIG. 7, the clutch cover 60 supports the central<br>
portion of the secondary sheave shaft 62 via a bearing 75. The<br>
left end portion of the second case block 35b supports a left<br>
portion of the secondary sheave shaft 62 via a bearing 76.<br>
A right end portion of the secondary sheave shaft 62 extends<br>
14<br><br>
to the belt chamber 67 through the second case block 35b and<br>
the clutch cover 60. A secondary sheave 72 of the CVT 30 is<br>
coupled with the right end portion of the secondary sheave shaft<br>
62.<br>
As shown in FIG. 6, the CVT 30 includes the primary sheave<br>
71, the secondary sheave 72 and the V-belt 73 wound around the<br>
primary sheave 71 and the secondary sheave 72. As described<br>
above, the primary sheave 71 is mounted to the right portion<br>
of the crankshaft 46. The secondary sheave 72 is coupled with<br>
the right portion of the secondary sheave shaft 62.<br>
The primary sheave 71 includes a fixed sheave half 71a<br>
positioned outside in the width direction of the vehicle, and<br>
a movable sheave half 71b positioned inside in the width<br>
direction of the vehicle and opposing the fixed sheave half<br>
71a. The fixed sheave half 71a is fixed to the right end portion<br>
of the primary sheave shaft 46c and rotates together with the<br>
primary sheave shaft 4 6c. The movable sheave half 71b is placed<br>
on the left side of the fixed sheave half 71a and is slidably<br>
mounted to the primary sheave shaft 4 6c. The movable sheave<br>
half 71b thus rotates together with the primary sheave shaft<br>
46c and is also slidable in the axial direction of the primary<br>
sheave shaft 4 6c. A belt groove is formed between the fixed<br>
sheave half 71a and the movable sheave half 71b.<br>
Cooling fans 95 are formed on an outer surface (right side<br>
surface in FIG. 6) of the fixed sheave half 71a. A cam surface<br>
15<br><br>
111 is formed on the left portion of the movable sheave half<br>
71b. A cam plate 112 is disposed on the left side of the cam<br>
surface 111. A roller weight 113 is placed between the cam<br>
surface 111 of the movable sheave 71b and the cam plate 112.<br>
The secondary sheave 72 includes a fixed sheave half 72a<br>
positioned inside in the width direction of the vehicle, and<br>
a movable sheave half 72b positioned outside in the width<br>
direction of the vehicle and opposing the fixed sheave half<br>
72a. The movable sheave half 72b is mounted to the right end<br>
portion of the secondary sheave shaft 62. The movable sheave<br>
half 72b is rotatable together with the secondary sheave shaft<br>
62 and is slidable on the secondary sheave shaft 62 in the axial<br>
direction thereof. A compression coil spring 114 is disposed<br>
at the right end of the secondary sheave shaft 62. The movable<br>
sheave half 72b receives the leftward urging force of the<br>
compression coil spring 114 that is directed leftward. A shaft<br>
core portion of the fixed sheave half 72a is a cylindrical slide<br>
collar that is fitted on the secondary sheave shaft 62 by spline<br>
connection.<br>
A speed reduction ratio of the CVT 30 is decided in<br>
accordance with relationships between a magnitude of the force<br>
with which the roller weight 113 pushes the movable sheave half<br>
71b rightward and a magnitude of the force with which the<br>
compression coil spring 114 pushes the movable sheave half 72b<br>
of the secondary sheave 72 leftward.<br>
16<br><br>
That is, upon increase of the rotational speed of the<br>
primary sheave shaft 46c, the roller weight 113 receives the<br>
centrifugal force and moves outward in the radial direction<br>
to push the movable sheave half 71b rightward. Then, the<br>
movable sheave half 71b moves rightward and the belt winding<br>
radius in the primary sheave 71 becomes larger. Following this<br>
operation, the belt winding radius in the secondary sheave 72<br>
becomes smaller. The movable sheave half 72b of the secondary<br>
sheave 72 moves rightward against the urging force of the<br>
compression coil spring 114. As a result, the winding radius<br>
of the V-belt 73 in the primary sheave 71 becomes larger, while<br>
the winding radius in the secondary sheave 72 becomes smaller.<br>
The speed reduction ratio becomes smaller, accordingly.<br>
In the meantime, upon decrease of the rotational speed of<br>
the primary sheave shaft 4 6c, the roller weight 113 moves inward<br>
in the radial direction along the cam surface 111 of the movable<br>
sheave half 71b and the cam plate 112 because the centrifugal<br>
force of the roller weight 113 becomes smaller. Therefore,<br>
the force with which the roller weight 113 pushes the movable<br>
sheave half 71b rightward becomes smaller. Then, the urging<br>
force of the compression coil spring 114 becomes larger<br>
relative to the above force. The movable sheave half 72b of<br>
the secondary sheave 72 moves leftward. In response to this<br>
movement, the movable sheave half 71b of the primary sheave<br>
71 also moves leftward. As a result, the belt winding radius<br>
17<br><br>
in the primary sheave 71 becomes smaller, while the belt winding<br>
radius in the secondary sheave 72 becomes larger. The speed<br>
reduction ratio becomes larger, accordingly.<br>
The fixed sheave half 71a and the movable sheave half 71b<br>
of the primary sheave 71 are made of aluminum or an aluminum<br>
alloy containing aluminum as a part thereof. Sheave surfaces<br>
(surfaces contacting with the V-belt 73) of the fixed sheave<br>
half 71a and the movable sheave half 71b of the primary sheave<br>
71 are plated with chrome. Consequently, each sheave surface<br>
hardness of the fixed sheave half 71a and the movable sheave<br>
half 71b teaches approximately l,000Hv. However, the plating<br>
material for coating the sheave surfaces is not limited to the<br>
chrome if the material is sufficient to enhance the wear<br>
resistance.<br>
The fixed sheave half 72a and the movable sheave body 72b<br>
of the secondary sheave 72 are made of stainless steel (SUS304) .<br>
Additionally, no sheave surfaces of the fixed sheave half 72a<br>
and the movable sheave body 72b of the secondary sheave 72 are<br>
plated with chrome. Consequently, The respective sheave<br>
surface hardness values of the fixed sheave half 72a and the<br>
movable sheave half 72b reach approximately 400Hv.<br>
A seal groove 68a is formed along a periphery of the inner<br>
case 53a on the left side thereof. A periphery of the second<br>
case block 35b on the right side thereof is inserted into the<br>
seal groove 68a.  Additionally, an 0-ring 68 is interposed<br>
18<br><br>
between the inner case 53a and the second case block 35b in<br>
the seal groove 68a. Also, another seal groove 69a is formed<br>
along the periphery of the inner case 53a on the right side<br>
thereof. A periphery of the outer case 53b is inserted into<br>
the seal groove 69a. Another O-ring 69 is interposed between<br>
the inner case 53a and the outer case 53b in the seal groove<br>
69a. The outer case 53b and the second case block 35b are<br>
coupled with each other by bolts 70 under a condition that the<br>
inner case 53a is interposed between the outer case 53b and<br>
the second case block 35b.<br>
As shown in FIG. 7, the centrifugal clutch 41 is mounted<br>
to the left portion of the secondary sheave shaft 62. The<br>
centrifugal clutch 41 is a wet type multiple disk clutch and<br>
includes a generally cylindrical clutch housing 78 and a clutch<br>
boss 77. The clutch housing 78 is fitted onto the secondary<br>
sheave shaft 62 by spline connection and rotates in unison with<br>
the secondary sheave shaft 62. A plurality of circular clutch<br>
disks 79 are attached to the clutch housing 78. The clutch<br>
disks 7 9 are spaced apart from each other in the axial direction<br>
of the secondary sheave shaft 62.<br>
A cylindrical gear 80 is rotatably fitted on and around<br>
the left portion of the secondary sheave shaft 62 via two<br>
bearings 81a, 81b. The clutch boss 77 is positioned inside<br>
relative to the clutch disks 79 in the radial direction and<br>
is positioned outside relative to the gear 80 in the radial<br>
19<br><br>
direction. The clutch boss 77 meshes with the gear 80. The<br>
gear 80 thus rotates together with the clutch boss 77. A<br>
plurality of circular friction disks 82 are attached to the<br>
clutch boss 77 externally in the radial direction. The<br>
friction disks 82 are spaced apart from each other in the axial<br>
direction of the secondary sheave shaft 62. The respective<br>
friction disks 82 are interposed between the neighboring clutch<br>
disks 79, 79.<br>
A plurality of cam surfaces 83a are formed on the left side<br>
of the clutch housing 78. Roller weights 84a are disposed<br>
between the cam surfaces 83a and the clutch disk 79 placed at<br>
the right-most position and opposing the cam surfaces 83a.<br>
The centrifugal clutch 41 is automatically switched<br>
between a clutch-in condition (connected condition) and a<br>
clutch-out condition (disconnected condition) in accordance<br>
with magnitudes of the centrifugal force affected to the roller<br>
weights 84a.<br>
That is, when a rotational speed of the clutch housing 78<br>
exceeds a preset speed, the centrifugal force moves the roller<br>
weights 84a outward in the radial direction. The roller<br>
weights 84a thus push the clutch disks 79 leftward. As a result,<br>
the clutch disks 79 and the friction disks 82 compressively<br>
contact with each other. The centrifugal clutch 41 thus is<br>
in the clutch-in condition in which the driving force of the<br>
secondary sheave shaft 62 is transmitted through the gear 80<br>
20<br><br>
and the reduction gear mechanism 42 to the output shaft 85.<br>
On the other hand, when the rotational speed of the clutch<br>
housing 78 becomes lower than the preset speed, the centrifugal<br>
force exerted on the roller weights 84a becomes smaller. The<br>
roller weights 84a thus move inward in the radial direction.<br>
As a result, the clutch disks 79 and the friction disks 82 are<br>
released from the state of compressive contact. The<br>
centrifugal clutch 41 thus is brought in the clutch-out<br>
condition in which no driving force of the secondary sheave<br>
shaft 62 is transmitted through the gear 8 0 and the reduction<br>
gear mechanism 42. Additionally, in FIG. 7, the front (upper<br>
side in FIG. 7) portion of the centrifugal clutch 41 represents<br>
the clutch-out condition, while the rear (lower side in FIG.<br>
7) portion thereof represents the clutch-in condition.<br>
The reduction gear mechanism 42 is interposed between the<br>
centrifugal clutch 41 and an output shaft 85. The reduction<br>
gear mechanism 42 has a shift shaft 100 extending parallel to<br>
the secondary sheave shaft 62 and the output shaft 85. The<br>
shift shaft 100 is journaled for rotation by the first case<br>
block 35a via a bearing 101 and is also journaled for rotation<br>
by the second case block 35b via a bearing 102. A first shift<br>
gear 103 meshing with the gear 80 is placed at a right end portion<br>
of the shift shaft 100.<br>
A second shift gear 104 having a diameter smaller than a<br>
diameter of the first shift gear 103 is placed at a central<br>
21<br><br>
portion of the shift shaft 100. A third shift gear 105 meshing<br>
with the second shift gear 104 is externally and<br>
circumferentially formed at a right end portion of the output<br>
shaft 85. The left end portion of the secondary sheave shaft<br>
62 supports an internal circumferential portion of the right<br>
end portion of the output shaft 85 via a bearing 106.<br>
Accordingly, the secondary sheave shaft 62 journals the output<br>
shaft 85 for rotation via the bearing 106. A left end portion<br>
of the first case block 35a journals a central portion of the<br>
output shaft 85 for rotation via a bearing 107.<br>
In the structure described above, the clutch boss 77 and<br>
the output shaft 85 are coupled with each other through the<br>
gear 80, the first shift gear 103, the shift shaft 100, the<br>
second shift gear 104 and the third shift gear 105. The output<br>
shaft 85 thus rotates with the rotation of the clutch boss 77.<br>
A left end portion of the output shaft 85 extends through<br>
the first case block 35a and projects outside of the crankcase<br>
35. A drive sprocket 108 is fixed to the left end portion of<br>
the output shaft 85. A chain 109 is engaged with the drive<br>
sprocket 108 to transmit the driving force from the output shaft<br>
85 to the rear wheel 26. Additionally, the mechanism for<br>
transmitting the driving force to the rear wheel 2 6 is not<br>
limited to the chain 109. Other components such as, for example,<br>
a transmitting belt, a gear train of plural gears assembled<br>
with each other and a drive shaft may be used as the mechanism<br>
22<br><br>
for transmitting the driving force from the output shaft 85<br>
to the rear wheel 26.<br>
Next, a structure of the V-belt 73 will be described. As<br>
shown in FIGs. 8 and 9, the V-belt 73 includes a plurality of<br>
resin blocks 73a aligned in one direction and a pair of coupling<br>
bodies 73b for coupling the resin blocks 73a. As shown in FIG.<br>
9, each resin block 73a is generally formed as a trapezoid to<br>
extend along the respective belt grooves of the primary sheave<br>
71 and the secondary sheave 72. Recessed portions 73c recessed<br>
inward are formed at respective lateral sides of each resin<br>
block 73a.<br>
The coupling bodies 73b are endlessly formed. As shown<br>
in FIG. 8, the coupling bodies 73b extend in the alignment<br>
direction of the resin blocks 73a and are inserted into the<br>
recessed portions 73c of the respective resin blocks 73a.<br>
Because the coupling bodies 73b are inserted into the recessed<br>
portions 73c of the resin blocks 73a as thus described, the<br>
plurality of resin blocks 73 are coupled with each other via<br>
the paired coupling bodies 73b. Each coupling body 73b is made<br>
of rubber. As shown in FIG. 9, a plurality of reinforcing core<br>
wires 73d are embedded in each coupling body 73b of rubber.<br>
In this V-belt 73, the left and right lateral side surfaces<br>
of the resin blocks 73a and the coupling bodies 73b are contact<br>
surfaces in contact with the respective sheave surfaces of the<br>
primary sheave 71 and the secondary sheave 72.<br>
23<br><br>
Additionally, any V-belts are sufficient to be the V-belt<br>
for the present invention if at least a part of the contact<br>
portion thereof contacting with the sheave surfaces is made<br>
of resin. That is, the V-belt for the present invention is<br>
not limited to the V-belt 73 in which the coupling bodies 73b<br>
couple the plurality of resin blocks 73a with each other.<br>
As thus described, according to the CVT 30 of this<br>
embodiment, the sheave surface hardness of the secondary sheave<br>
72 is lower than the sheave surface hardness of the primary<br>
sheave 71. Therefore, the wear of the V-belt 73 in the<br>
secondary sheave 72 can be avoided even in the top speed where<br>
the contact pressure of the sheave surfaces is high. On the<br>
other hand, because the secondary sheave 72 is hardly affected<br>
by fluctuations of the engine speed in comparison with the<br>
primary sheave 71, the secondary sheave 72 is unlikely to<br>
remarkably wear in comparison with the primary sheave 71, even<br>
though the sheave surface hardness of the secondary sheave 72<br>
is relatively low. Accordingly, both of the prevention of the<br>
wear of the V-belt 73 and the prevention of the wear of the<br>
sheaves (the primary sheave 71 and the secondary sheave 72)<br>
can be highly compatibly ensured.<br>
In this embodiment, the sheave body of the primary sheave<br>
71 (the fixed sheave half 71a and the movable sheave half 71b)<br>
is made of aluminum and the sheave surface of the sheave body<br>
is coated with chrome. Therefore, the surface hardness of the<br>
24<br><br>
sheave surface can be raised while the sheave body is lightened.<br>
Also, because aluminum has good cooling retaining property,<br>
the cooling performance of the primary sheave 71 can be enhanced.<br>
Higher performance of the CVT 30 in turn thus can be achieved.<br>
On the other hand, the fixed sheave half 72a and the movable<br>
sheave half 72b of the secondary sheave 72 are made of stainless<br>
steel and the sheave surfaces thereof are not plated with chrome.<br>
Accordingly, the CVT 30 can be inexpensively produced to the<br>
extent that no plating is necessary for the secondary sheave<br>
72. Further, according to this embodiment, the surface<br>
hardness of the sheave surface of the primary sheave 71 can<br>
be raised higher than the surface hardness of the sheave surface<br>
of the secondary sheave 71 by the relatively simple method or<br>
plating process.<br>
Additionally, stainless steel has the superior wear<br>
resistance. The corrosion resistance of the secondary sheave<br>
72 thus can be maintained in a good state without the sheave<br>
surface of the secondary sheave 72 being plated. Because any<br>
rust hardly occurs, the ambient air can cool the secondary<br>
sheave 72 without requiring any particular measures.<br>
Because the secondary sheave 72 in this embodiment is made<br>
of stainless steel, the sheave surface hardness of the<br>
secondary sheave 72 can be approximately 400Hv. However, the<br>
sheave surface hardness of the secondary sheave 72 is only<br>
required to be equal to or higher than l00Hv in view of the<br>
25<br><br>
prevention of the wear of the sheave surface, and thus is not<br>
limited to be about 400Hv.<br>
In the CVT 30 according to this embodiment, a distance in<br>
which the V-belt 73 moves in the radial direction of the<br>
secondary sheave 72 while a condition under which the speed<br>
reduction ratio is the maximum value (top speed) varies to<br>
another condition under which the speed reduction ratio is the<br>
minimum value (low speed) is shorter than a distance in which<br>
the V-belt 73 moves in the radial direction of the primary<br>
sheave 72. Specifically, the distance of the movement of the<br>
V-belt 73 in the radial direction of the sheaves is represented<br>
by a difference between the belt winding radius at the top speed<br>
and the belt winding radius at the low speed. In this<br>
embodiment, the difference between the belt winding radius at<br>
the top speed and the belt winding radius at the low speed in<br>
the primary sheave 71 is approximately 36.5mm, while the<br>
difference between the belt winding radius at the top speed<br>
and the belt winding radius at the low speed in the secondary<br>
sheave 72 is approximately 32.5mm (
As thus discussed, the amount of the movement of the V-belt<br>
73 in the radial direction in the secondary sheave 72 is shorter<br>
than that in the primary sheave 71. Therefore, the wear of<br>
the secondary sheave 72 can be prevented even though the sheave<br>
surface hardness of the secondary sheave 72 is lower than the<br>
sheave surface hardness of the primary sheave 71.<br>
26<br><br>
As shown in FIG. 10(a), in the CVT 30 according to this<br>
embodiment, a distance between the primary sheave 71 and the<br>
secondary sheave 72 is short in comparison with sizes of the<br>
primary sheave 71 and the secondary sheave 72. Specifically,<br>
in this embodiment, a distance L between the axis of the primary<br>
sheave 71 and the axis of the secondary sheave 72 is less than<br>
double the diameter D2 of the secondary sheave 72. Also, both<br>
of the primary sheave 71 and the secondary sheave 72 are<br>
disposed between the axis of the front wheel 19 and the rear<br>
wheel 26 (see FIG. 1) . In this embodiment, therefore, a ratio<br>
of the part contacting with the sheave surfaces of the primary<br>
sheave 71 and the secondary sheave 72 to the whole length of<br>
the V-belt 73 is large. Accordingly, ingoing and outgoing<br>
times of the V-belt 73 to and from the sheave grooves are<br>
frequent. The CVT 30 thus intrinsically has the structure in<br>
which the V-belt 73 is likely to wear. In this embodiment,<br>
however, the wear of the V-belt 73 can be prevented as discussed<br>
above. Thus, no problem arises even though the distance<br>
between the primary sheave 71 and the secondary sheave 72 is<br>
short.<br><embodiment><br>
As shown in FIGs. 11 and 12, a CVT 30 according to Embodiment<br>
2 has a structure in which a spiral groove is formed in each<br>
of the sheave surfaces of the primary sheave 71 and the<br>
secondary sheave 72 of Embodiment 1.<br>
27<br><br>
The CVT 30 needs some frictional force between the sheaves<br>
71, 72 and the V-belt 73 to properly transmit the driving force.<br>
In the meantime, however, because the V-belt 73 travels between<br>
the primary sheave 71 and the secondary sheave 72, respective<br>
portions of the V-belt 73, in local views, continuously go into<br>
the sheave grooves and go out therefrom. Some extent of<br>
slidability (hereunder, "lubrication property" is used) thus<br>
is necessary between the V-belt 73 and the respective sheaves<br>
71, 72. This is because, unless the lubrication property is<br>
ensured, heat is generated by the friction between the V-belt<br>
73 and the sheaves 71, 72, and the CVT 30 is likely to be under<br>
an excessively heated condition.<br>
Meanwhile, the CVT 30 is normally used under the<br>
circumstances in which no oil, water or the like are allowed<br>
to enter the CVT 30 (hereunder, referred to "under the dry<br>
circumstances"). No lubricating agent is permissible to be<br>
applied between the V-belt 73 and the sheaves 71, 72. Thus,<br>
it is conceivable that the lubrication property between the<br>
sheaves 71, 72 and the V-belt 73 is brought mainly by powder<br>
originating from the V-belt 73 (wear powder) . That is, it is<br>
conceivable that the sheaves 71, 72 and the V-belt 73 are<br>
slidable with each other while keeping some extent of the<br>
friction because the wear powder originating from the V-belt<br>
73 is retained on the sheave surfaces.<br>
If, however, the sheave surfaces are smooth, proper<br>
28<br><br>
retention of the wear powder on the contact portions with the<br>
V-belt 73 is difficult. If the retention is difficult, proper<br>
keeping of the lubrication property between the sheaves 71,<br>
72 and the V-belt 73 is also difficult. Consequently,<br>
irregularities for retaining the wear powder are preferably<br>
given to the sheave surfaces (at least the portions in contact<br>
with the V-belt 73) .<br>
As shown in FIGs. ll(a) and (b), in this embodiment, a<br>
groove 91 is formed on the sheave surfaces of the fixed sheave<br>
half 71a and the movable sheave half 71b of the primary sheave<br>
71	by turning. Also, as shown in FIGs. 12(a) and (b) , another<br>
groove 91 is formed on the sheave surfaces of the fixed sheave<br>
half 72a and the movable sheave half 72b of the secondary sheave<br>
72	by turning.<br>
The respective grooves 91 of this embodiment are spirally<br>
formed around axes 92 of the sheave halves 71a, 71b, 72a, 72b.<br>
As shown in FIG. 11(b) and FIG. 12(b), because of having the<br>
grooves 91, cross sections of the sheave halves 71a, 71b, 72a,<br>
72b in the radial direction are unevenly formed. Additionally,<br>
reference numeral 93 of FIG. 11(b) indicates a chrome plating<br>
layer.<br>
A pitch [p] of the groove 91 is preferably, for example,<br>
0.10mm. Surface roughness of each sheave surface is<br>
preferably, equal to or less than 0.5z, for example.<br>
However, the respective grooves on the sheave surfaces are<br>
29<br><br>
not limited to the spiral grooves 91. For example, as shown<br>
in FIG. 13, a plurality of coaxial circular grooves 91a formed<br>
on each sheave surface are applicable. In view of properly<br>
retaining the wear powder, the grooves of the sheave surfaces<br>
are required to be formed in such a manner that the cross<br>
sections of the sheave halves 71a, 71b, 72a, 72b in the radial<br>
direction are to be uneven. However, as long as the wear powder<br>
can be properly retained, configurations of the grooves on the<br>
sheave surfaces are not specifically limited.<br>
FIGs. 14 and 15 show test results indicating differences<br>
as to the belt wear based upon sheave surface hardness of the<br>
secondary sheave 72. In FIGs. 14 and 15, each horizontal axis<br>
indicates of the running distance of a motorcycle, while each<br>
vertical axis indicates the wear of the V-belt 73 in its width<br>
direction. In both tests shown in FIGs. 14 and 15, the sheave<br>
surface of the primary sheave 71 is plated with chrome. In<br>
the embodiments, the secondary sheave 72 is made of stainless<br>
steel, i.e., SUS304, and is not coated with any plating material.<br>
Therefore, the sheave surface hardness of the secondary sheave<br>
72 is lower than the sheave surface hardness of the primary<br>
sheave 71. To the contrary, in the compared examples, the<br>
sheave surface of the secondary sheave 72 is plated with chrome.<br>
Thus, the sheave surface hardness of the secondary sheave 72<br>
and the sheave surface hardness of the first sheave 71 are equal<br>
to each other.<br>
30<br><br>
FIG. 14 shows examples in which the pitch [p] of the groove<br>
is 0.05mm, while FIG. 15 shows examples in which the pitch [p]<br>
is 0.10mm. As understood from the figures, the wear of the<br>
V-belt 73 in the embodiments is less than in the comparative<br>
examples.<br>
According to this embodiment, because each of the sheave<br>
surfaces of the primary sheave 71 and the secondary sheave 72<br>
has the spiral groove 91, the wear powder of the V-belt 73 can<br>
be properly retained on the sheave surfaces. Accordingly, a<br>
good lubrication property can be ensured between the sheaves<br>
71, 72 and the V-belt 73 while some extent of the frictional<br>
force is kept therebetween. As a result, the heat generation<br>
of the V-belt 73 can be prevented. In this point as well, both<br>
of the prevention of the wear of the V-belt 73 and the prevention<br>
of the wear of the sheaves 71, 72 can be highly compatibly<br>
ensured.<br>
Also, according to this embodiment, because the wear of<br>
the sheaves 71, 72 is prevented, the uneven configuration on<br>
each sheave surface is hardly deteriorated with time elapsing.<br>
Accordingly, the lubrication property of the V-belt 73 can be<br>
maintained for a long period of time.<br>
If the sheave surface of the secondary sheave 72 is plated<br>
with chrome, the plated chrome of the secondary sheave 72 whose<br>
contact pressure is high at the maximum drive speed (top speed)<br>
can wear away prior to the primary sheave 71, and excessive<br>
31<br><br>
amount of the wear powder can be produced from the secondary<br>
sheave 72. In this embodiment, however, because the secondary<br>
sheave 72 is not plated with chrome, the wear power produced<br>
from the secondary sheave 72 does not cause any damage to the<br>
primary sheave 71. Also, the wear powder of the plated chrome<br>
is only produced from the primary sheave 71 whose contact<br>
pressure is low. Therefore, an amount of the wear powder<br>
produced from the whole sheaves can be small.<br>
In addition, according to this embodiment, the grooves 91<br>
are formed by turning the sheave surfaces of the respective<br>
sheaves 71, 72. The grooves 91 thus can be simply and<br>
inexpensively realized.<br>
As thus described, the present invention is useful with<br>
belt type continuously variable transmissions and straddle<br>
type vehicles having the same.<br>
