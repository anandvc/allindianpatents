Mixtures of reactive dyes and their use<br>
The present invention relates to mixtures of reactive dyes that are suitable for dyeing or printing nitrogen-containing or hydroxy-group-containing fibre materials and yield dyeings or prints having good all-round fastness properties.<br>
The practice of dyeing has recently led to higher demands being made on the quality of the dyeings and the profitability of the dyeing process. As a result, there continues to be a need for novel, readily available dyeing compositions having good properties, especially in respect of their application.<br>
Dyeing nowadays requires reactive dyes that have, for example, sufficient substantivity and at the same time good ease of washing-off of unfixed dye. They should also exhibit a good tinctorial yield and high reactivity, the objective being especially to obtain dyeings having high degrees of fixing. In many cases, the build-up behaviour of reactive dyes is insufficient to meet the demands being made, especially when dyeing very deep shades.<br>
The problem underlying the present invention is therefore to provide new mixtures of reactive dyes that are particularly suitable for dyeing and printing fibre materials and that exhibit the qualities described above to a high degree. The dyes should also yield dyeings having good all-round fastness properties, for example fastness to light and to wetting.<br>
The present invention accordingly relates to dye mixtures comprising at least one dye of formula<br><br>
together with at least one dye of formula<br><br><br>

Suitable as a cyanuric halide of formula (9) is cyanuric chloride or cyanuric fluoride, especially cyanuric chloride.<br>
Since the above-mentioned process steps can be carried out in different orders, if desired simultaneously, different process variants are possible. Generally the reaction is carried out stepwise, the order in which the simple reactions between the individual reaction components are carried out advantageously being selected according to the specific conditions. In a preferred embodiment: (i) approximately one molar equivalent of a compound of formula (6) is diazotised and<br>

(ii) approximately one molar equivalent of a compound of formula (8) is condensed with approximately one molar equivalent of a compound of formula (9); (iii) approximately one molar equivalent of a compound of formula (10) is reacted with approximately one molar equivalent of the compound obtained according to (ii) to form a<br>
i     secondary condensation product; and<br>
(iv) approximately one molar equivalent of the secondary condensation product obtained according to (iii) is diazotised and coupled with the compound obtained according to (i).<br>
The diazotisation and coupling are carried out in customary manner, for example by '     diazotising the compound of formula (6) and the secondary condensation product obtained according to (iii) in a mineral acid solution, for example in a hydrochloric acid solution, with a nitrite, e.g. sodium nitrite, at low temperature, e.g. at from 0 to 5°C, and then coupling with the appropriate coupling component in a neutral to slightly acidic medium, e.g. at a pH of from 3 to 7, preferably from 3 to 4 or from 5.5. to 6.5, and at low temperatures, e.g. from 0 to ■      30°C.<br>
The condensation reactions are generally carried out analogously to known processes, generally in an aqueous solution at temperatures of, for example, from 0 to 50°C and at a pH value of, for example, from 3 to 10.<br>
The compounds of formulae (6), (7), (8), (9) and (10) are known or can be prepared analogously to known compounds.<br><br>
The reactive dyes of formulae (1) and (2) in the dye mixtures according to the invention contain sulfo groups which are each present either in free sulfonic acid form or, preferably, in salt form, e.g. in the form of a sodium, lithium, potassium or ammonium salt or a salt of an organic amine, e.g. in triethanolammonium salt form.<br>
The reactive dyes of formulae (1) and (2) and accordingly also the dye mixtures may comprise further additives, e.g. sodium chloride or dextrin.<br>
The dyes of formulae (1) and (2) are present in the dye mixture according to the invention in a ratio by weight of, for example, from 1:99 to 99:1, preferably from 5:95 to 95:5 and especially from 10:90 to 90:10.<br>
Where appropriate the dye mixtures according to the invention and the reactive dyes of formula (2aa) according to the invention may comprise further adjuvants that, for example, improve handling or increase the storage stability, for example buffers, dispersants or dust-removing agents. Such adjuvants are known to the person skilled in the art.<br>
The dye mixtures according to the invention and the dyes of formula (2aa) according to the invention are suitable for dyeing and printing an extremely wide variety of materials, such as hydroxyl-group-containing or nitrogen-containing fibre materials. Examples are silk, leather, wool, polyamide fibres and polyurethanes and especially cellulosic fibre materials of all kinds. Such cellulosic fibre materials are, for example, the natural cellulosic fibres, such as cotton, linen and hemp, and also cellulose and regenerated cellulose. The dye mixtures according to the invention and the dyes according to the invention are also suitable for dyeing or printing hydroxyl-group-containing fibres present in blend fabrics, e.g. mixtures of cotton with polyester fibres or polyamide fibres. The dye mixtures according to the invention and the dyes according to the invention are especially suitable for dyeing or printing cellulosic fibre materials, especially those containing cotton. They can also be used to dye or print natural or synthetic polyamide fibre materials.<br>
The present invention accordingly relates also to the use of the dye mixtures according to the invention and the dyes of formula (2aa) according to the invention in the dyeing or printing of hydroxyl-group-containing or nitrogen-containing, especially cellulosic, fibre materials.<br><br>
The dye mixtures according to the invention and the dyes of formula (2aa) according to the invention can be applied to the fibre material and fixed to the fibre in a variety of ways, especially in the form of aqueous dye solutions and print pastes. They are suitable both for the exhaust process and for dyeing in accordance with the pad-dyeing process, according to which the goods are impregnated with aqueous, where appropriate salt-containing, dye solutions, and the dyes are fixed after alkali treatment or in the presence of an alkali, where appropriate with the action of heat or by storing at room temperature for several hours. After fixing, the dyeings or prints are rinsed thoroughly with cold and hot water, if desired with the addition of an agent that acts as a dispersant and promotes the diffusion of unfixed dye.<br>
The dye mixtures according to the invention and the dyes according to the invention are distinguished by high reactivity, good fixing capacity and very good build-up capacity. Accordingly they can be used in the exhaust dyeing process at low dyeing temperatures and require only short steaming times in the pad-steam process. The degress of fixing are high and unfixed dye can be washed off readily, the difference between the degree of exhaust and the degree of fixing being remarkably small, that is to say the soaping loss is very small. The dye mixtures according to the invention and the dyes according to the invention are also especially suitable for printing, especially on cotton, and also for printing nitrogen-containing fibres, for example wool or silk or blend fabrics that contain wool or silk.<br>
The dyeings and prints produced using the dye mixtures according to the invention and the dyes according to the invention have a high tinctorial strength and a high fibre-dye binding stability in both the acidic and the alkaline range, as well as good fastness to light and very good wet-fastness properties, such as fastness to washing, to water, to seawater, to cross-dyeing and to perspiration, and good fastness to pleating, to hot pressing and to rubbing. The dyeings obtained exhibit fibre-levelness and surface-levelness.<br>
The dye mixtures according to the invention and the dyes of formula (2aa) according to the invention are also suitable as colorants for use in recording systems. Such recording systems are, for example, commercially available Inkjet printers for paper or textile printing, or writing instruments, such as fountain pens and ballpoint pens and especially inkjet printers. For that purpose the dye mixture according to the invention or the dyes according to the invention is/are first brought into a form suitable for use in recording systems. A suitable form is, for example, an aqueous ink that comprises the dye mixture according to the<br><br>
invention or the dyes according to the invention as colorant. The inks can be prepared in customary manner by mixing together the individual constituents in the desired amount of water.<br>
Substrates that come into consideration include the above-mentioned hydroxyl-group-containing or nitrogen-containing fibre materials, especially cellulosic fibre materials. The substrate is preferably a textile fibre material.<br>
Also suitable as substrates are paper or plastics films.<br>
Examples of paper that may be mentioned include commercially available inkjet paper, photo paper, glossy paper, plastics-coated paper, for example Epson inkjet paper, Epson photo paper, Epson glossy paper, Epson glossy film, HP special inkjet paper, Encad photo gloss paper, llford photo paper.

The inks may also comprise buffer substances, e.g. borax, borates, phosphates, polyphosphates or citrates. Examples that may be mentioned include borax, sodium borate,<br><br>
sodium tetraborate, sodium dihydrogen phosphate, disodium hydrogen phosphate, sodium tripolyphosphate, sodium pentapolyphosphate and sodium citrate. They are used especially in amounts of from 0.1 to 3 % by weight, preferably from 0.1 to 1 % by weight, based on the total weight of the ink, in order to establish a pH value of, for example, from 4 to 9, especially from 5 to 8.5.<br>
As further additives, the inks may comprise surfactants or humectants.<br>
Suitable surfactants include commercially available anionic or non-ionic surfactants. As humectants in the inks according to the invention there come into consideration, for example, urea or a mixture of sodium lactate (advantageously in the form of a 50 % to 60 % aqueous solution) and glycerol and/or propylene glycol in amounts of preferably from 0.1 to 30 % by weight, especially from 2 to 30 % by weight.<br>

A suitable preservative is e.g. a 20 % by weight solution of 1,2-benzisothiazolin-3-one in dipropylene glycol (Proxel® GXL).<br>
The inks may also comprise further additives, such as fluorinated polymers or telomers, e.g. polyethoxyperfluoroalcohols (Forafac® or Zonyl® products) in an amount of e.g. from 0.01 to 1 % by weight, based on the total weight of the ink.<br><br>
In the inkjet printing method, individual droplets of the ink are sprayed onto a substrate in a controlled manner from a nozzle. For this purpose, predominantly the continuous inkjet method and the drop-on-demand method are used. In the continuous inkjet method, the droplets are produced continuously and any droplets not required for the printing are conveyed to a collecting vessel and recycled, whereas in the drop-on-demand method droplets are produced and printed as required; that is to say droplets are produced only when required for the printing. The production of the dropfets can be effected, for example, by means of a piezo-inkjet head or by means of thermal energy (bubble jet). Printing by means of a piezo-inkjet head and printing in accordance with the continuous inkjet method are preferred.<br>

8-hydroxynaphthalene-3,6-disulfonic acid (H acid) in 500 parts of water, which solution has<br>
been adjusted to a pH of 4 with hydrochloric acid. During the coupling reaction the pH is<br>
maintained at from 3 to 3.5 with sodium acetate. There is obtained the monoazo dye that<br>
corresponds to the formula<br><br><br>
(c)	A neutral solution of 28.1 parts of 4-(p-sulfatoethylsulfonyl)aniline in 100 parts of water is<br>
added to a suspension obtained by stirring a solution of 19.5 parts of cyanuric chloride in<br>
80 parts of acetone into a mixture of 200 parts of water and 200 parts of ice. The condensation reaction is continued for 1 hour with stirring at from 0 to 5°C and at a pH of from 3 to 4. The pH is maintained at that value by the addition of sodium hydrogen carbonate.<br>
(d)	A neutral solution of 17.6 parts of 1,3-phenylenediamine-4-suIfonic acid in 180 parts of<br>
water is added to the suspension obtained according to (c), and the mixture is stirred for one<br>
day at 25°C and at a pH of from 6.5 to 7.2. There is obtained a compound that corresponds<br>
to the formula<br><br>
(e)	250 parts of ice and 60 parts of cone, hydrochloric acid are then added to the solution<br>
according to (d), and the mixture is cooled to 0°C and diazotised slowly at that temperature<br>
with 7 parts of sodium nitrite.<br>
(f)	The diazo solution according to (e) is adjusted to a pH of from 5.5 to 6 with sodium<br>
hydrogen carbonate and coupled with the monoazo dye obtained according to (b) at a pH of<br>
from 5.8 to 6.2. Once the reaction is complete, the reaction product is precipitated by the<br>
addition of potassium chloride, filtered off, washed with saturated potassium chloride solution<br>
and dried in vacuo at 40°C. There is obtained a compound that corresponds to the formula<br><br><br>
in the form of the free acid, and dyes cotton a navy blue shade with good all-round fastness properties.<br>
Dyeing procedure I<br>
100 parts of cotton fabric are placed at 60°C in 1500 parts of a dyebath containing 45 g/l of sodium chloride and 2 parts of the reactive dye obtained according to the Preparation Example. After 45 minutes at 60°C, 20 g/l of calcined soda are added. Dyeing is continued at that temperature for a further 45 minutes. The dyed goods are then rinsed, soaped at the boil for a quarter of an hour with a non-ionic detergent, rinsed again and dried.<br>
As an alternative to the described procedure, dyeing can be carried out at 80°C instead of at 60°C.<br>
Dyeing procedure II<br>

The pH is then adjusted to a value of 5.5 using acetic acid (80%). The dyebath is heated at 50°C for 10 minutes and then 10 parts of a woollen fabric are added. The dyebath is heated to a temperature of 100°C in the course of about 50 minutes and dyeing is carried out at that temperature for 60 minutes. The dyebath is then cooled to 90°C and the dyed goods are removed. The woollen fabric is washed with hot and cold water, then spun and dried.<br>
Printing procedure I<br>
While stirring rapidly, 3 parts of the dye according to the Preparation Example are sprinkled into 100 parts of a stock thickener containing 50 parts of 5 % sodium alginate thickener, 27.8 parts of water, 20 parts of urea, 1 part of sodium m-nitrobenzenesulfonate and 1.2 parts<br><br>
of sodium hydrogen carbonate. The print paste so obtained is used to print a cotton fabric, drying is carried out and the resulting printed fabric is steamed in saturated steam at 102°C for 2 minutes. The printed fabric is then rinsed, if desired soaped at the boil and again rinsed, and then dried.<br>
Printing procedure II<br>
(a)	Mercerised cotton satin is pad-dyed using a liquor containing 30 g/l of sodium carbonate<br>
and 50 g/l of urea (liquor uptake 70%) and dried.<br>
