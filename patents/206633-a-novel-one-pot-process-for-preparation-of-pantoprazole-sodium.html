Technical Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a novel one-pot process for the preparation of pantoprazole sodium in high yields and purity. The present invention further relates to process for conversion of pantoprazole sodium to pantoprazole sodium sesquihydrate and also to pantoprazole sodium monohydrate in good yields.<br>
Background and Prior art<br>
Pantoprazole an international non-proprietary name of a substituted benzimidazole (5-(difluoromethoxy)-2-[[(3,4-dimethoxy-2-pyridinyl)methyl]sulfinyl]-1H-benzimidazole) is a compound that inhibits gastric acid secretion. Pantoprazole sodium is a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) used to treat ulcers, gastroesophageal reflux disorder (GERD), erosive esophagitis and Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. It works by blocking acid production in the stomach. It may be used in combination with antibiotics (e.g., amoxicillin, clarithromycin) to treat certain types of ulcers.<br>
Pantoprazole was disclosed for the first time in European patent application EPO166287.<br><br>
The complete pharmacological and therapeutic effect for Pantoprazole can be achieved in the acid secreting parietal cells. By means of a feed back mechanism, this effect is diminished at the same rate as acid secretion is inhibited. As with other proton pump inhibitors and H2 Receptor inhibitors, treatment with Pantoprazole causes reduced acidity in the stomach causing a reversible increase in gastrin in proportion to the reduction in acidity. Pantoprazole sodium can be represented by the following structural formula.<br><br><br>
In one of the processes, described in this patent application that the reaction of 2-Chloromethyl-3,4-dimethoxy pyridine with 2-mercapto-5-difluoromethoxy benzimidazole to prepare the precursor sulfide, which was isolated and oxidized by using metachloroperbenzoic acid to yield pantoprazole base in a yield of 102% by weight with respect to 2-Chloromethyl-3,4 dimethoxy pyridine.<br>
PCT Application WO 97/29103 discloses the preparation of Pantoprazole by coupling carbonyl fragments to form the sulfoxide precursor which was further cyclised to obtain pantoprazole base.<br>
PCT Application WO 02/28852 discloses synthesis of pantoprazole and the preparation of key intermediates useful in its synthesis. Pantoprazole base was prepared by oxidation of the chloro derivative of pantoprazole using ammonium per molybdate or ammonium per tungstate in the presence of hydrogen peroxide. Further the chloro group in the resulting product was replaced by methoxy group to obtain pantoprazole base, the yield being about 70 % by weight of the pyridine precursor.<br>
PCT Application WO 02/062786 discloses a process for preparation of pantoprazole base<br>
by   oxidizing   the   precursor   of  pantoprazole   (i.e.   sulfide)   using   tertiary   butyl<br>
hydroperoxide  and oxone  in yield  of about  79%  weight percent  of the  sulfide<br>
intermediate.<br>
WO   91/19710   discloses   Pantoprazole   sodium   sesquihydrate   and   their   typical<br>
characteristics.<br>
US Patent 04/0186139A1 describes the preparation of Crystalline Form-I of Pantoprazole sodium sesquihydrate from pantoprazole free base by precipitation using various solvents.<br>
It is evident from the teachings of the prior art that multiple steps are required for the synthesis of pantoprazole sodium, also the intermediates involved for the synthesis are needed to be isolated at various steps and further purification is required to get the<br><br>
desired purity of the final product Since these methods involve many steps which results in a lower yield of pantoprazole sodium.<br>
The prior art methods described above also involves the use of many hazardous reagents like hydrogen peroxide, metachloroperbenzoic acid, etc. thus the processes from the prior art are unable to provide an environmentally safe and industrially applicable process with "substantial yields.<br>
Solution of these problems associated with prior art, becomes the objects of the present invention. Hence, the pressent invention provides industrially viable and economically feasible process thereby eliminating the all the above-mentioned shortcomings.<br>
Object of the invention<br>
The object of the present invention is to provide a novel one pot process for the synthesis of Pantoprazole sodium without the isolation and purification of the intermediates involved in the process.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a process, which involves the use of a phase transfer catalyst.<br>
Further object of the present invention is to provide a process, which avoids the use of hazardous reagents.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a industrially viable process for synthesis of pantoprazole sodium in a high yield and good purity and overcoming all the shortcomings as described in the prior art.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a process for conversion of pantoprazole sodium to pantoprazole sesquihydrate.<br><br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a process for conversion of pantoprazole sodium to pantopprazole monohydrate.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
The present invention discloses a novel one-pot process for the synthesis of pantoprazole sodium by reacting 2-chloro methyl 3, 4 -dimethoxy pyridine hydrochloride with 2-mercapto-5-difiuoromethoxy benzimidazole in an organic solvent system in presence of a phase transfer catalyst and further treating with aqueous sodium hypohalite solution to obtain pantoprazole sodiam in high yield and purity. The present invention further discloses a process for conversion of pantoprazole sodium to pantoprazole sodium sesquihydrate and also the conversion to pantoprazole sodium monohydrate.<br>

Water was added to the reaction mass and this reaction mass was used as such without isolation of the compound of formula (III) for the one-pot reaction.<br>
In another aspect, the present invention provides the use of phase transfer catalyst, which is advantageous as it helps in the progress of the reaction, which involves biphasic medium. The phase transfer catalyst was selected from a group consisting of tetrabutyl ammonium bromide, tetrabutyl ammonium chloride, benzyltriethyl ammonium chloride, methyltrioctyl ammonium chloride, hexadecyltrimethyl ammonium chloride and crown ethers preferably tetrabutyl ammonium bromide.<br>
The solvent system used in the process of present invention comprises water immiscible organic solvent and water containing an inorganic base. The water immiscible organic solvent is an aliphatic chlorinated hydrocarbon, selected from the group consisting of methylene dichloride, carbon tetrachloride, cyclohexane, chloroform and dichloroethane. The preferable solvent is methylene dichloride.<br>
The inorganic base employed in the present invention being alkaline metal hydroxides or carbonates more preferably sodium hydroxide.<br>
The process of the present invention was carried out in one pot without the isolation of any intermediates as illustrated in Scheme below.<br>
The intermediates (V) pantoprazole sulfide and pantoprazole base as shown in the scheme were not isolated during the process of the present invention were neither subjected to any purification. Further, the pantoprazole sulfide obtained in situ was oxidized using aqueous sodium hypohalite solution preferably aqueous     solution     of<br><br>
sodium hypochlorite with a strength in range of 2- 14 %, and having sodium hydroxide content 0.5 to 10 % preferably 1.0 to 3.0 % more preferably 2.0 to 2.3 %, at a temperature ranging from 0°C to ambient temperature, more preferably 5-8°C. The resulting reaction mass was cooled to afford pantoprazole sodium.<br>
Pharmaceutical preparations comprising pantoparazole sodium synthesized by above said method are prepared by conventional methods.<br>
Pantoprazole sodium as obtained by the process of the present invention was optionally further converted to pantoprazole sodium sesquihydrate by dissolving it in acetone and replacing the solvent by ethyl acetate followed by co-distilling with ethyl acetate and isolating the sesquihydrate from ethyl acetate - water mixture, this mixture contains water in a quantity sufficient enough to form the sesquihydrate<br>
Pantoprazole sodium as obtained by the process of the present invention was optionally converted to pantoprazole sodium monohydrate by stirring in ethyl acetate. Pantoprazole sodium obtained by the process of the present invention has a very high level of purity and the known impurities like sulfone, sulfone N- oxide, and sulfide were below 0.15% and individual unknown impurities were less than 0.1%.<br><br><br><br><br>
