CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
The present application claims benefit of priority to United Sates patent application serial number 60/879,458 filed on January 8,2007, which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to compounds with biological activity and pharmaceutical and cosmetic formulations thereof, their derivatives and methods of use, more specifically the present invention includes compounds with at least one (substituted phenyl)-propenal moiety and their biological activity and use thereof.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is well known that certain natural products may possess therapeutic effects, which has lead to their use in the treatment and prevention of human diseases across many cultures (e.g., Chinese herbal medicines and many other folk medicines). The effectiveness of such treatments has lead the pharmaceutical industry to seek and isolate active compounds from these natural products and develop the active ingredients as therapeutic or prophylactic drugs for the treatment and prevention of a variety of diseases or medical conditions. Thus many commonly used pharmaceuticals have been developed or have arisen from natural products. Among these include, aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid), which was isolated from bark of the willow tree; ephedrine and pseudoephedrine, which were isolated from a Chinese herb Ma Huang; and penicillin, which was isolated from fungus (Pennicillium chrysogenum). However, compounds isolated from natural products are known to play certain physiological function(s) in its native host; whereas their therapeutic effects against human diseases are not readily apparent. Historically, such therapeutic treatments were derived merely by accumulated experiences or "trial and error" in humans.  Moreover, because such compounds were not initially created for use in humans, the compounds in their native form are frequently not in the most optimal<br>
 <br>
form, both in structure as well as efficacy, to treat human diseases.  However, today's modern chemistry technology, including analytical and synthetic chemistries, together with the advances in medicinal biology have made it possible for one to dissect a chemical structure and localize a "pharmacophore" (a core structure that is essential for the therapeutic activity) within a compound such as one isolated from a natural product; furthermore, these new techniques allow one to synthesize new compounds, based on the structure of a pharmacophore, that possess optimal or even better therapeutic efficacy.<br>
In this invention we have demonstrated that a compound with a single (4-hydroxy-3-methoxy-phenyl)-propenal moiety possesses an activity that could reduce the expression of androgen receptor (AR) protein by enhancing its degradation. This discovery resulted in part from our extensive study of compound ASC-J9 (1,7-Bis-(3,4-dimethoxy-phenyl)-5-hydroxy-hepta-l,4,6-trien-3-one), a dimethylated form of a natural compound curcumin (existing as a major pigment in a turmeric plant). Compound curcumin and many of its analogs have been reported to possess numerous biological activities in vitro, such as, anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-tumor, and antiangiogenesis activities; but neither curcumin nor its analogues have been developed into a therapeutic drug to treat human diseases. This indicates curcumin in its native form is probably not an optimal molecule for development into a therapeutic drug.<br>
Previously we have discovered compounds ASC-J9 and ASC-J15 (5-Hydroxy-7-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxy-phenyl)-4-[3-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxy-phenyl)-acryloyl]-hepta-4,6-dienoic acid ethyl ester) (FIG. 1), both possess potent prostate cancer inhibitory and anti-androgenic activity. These two compounds, in our hand, also exhibited more potent anti-prostate cancer activity than a current therapeutic drug hydroxyl flutamide (HF), a class of "non-steroid anti-androgen" drug that is widely used to treat human prostate cancer.<br>
After extensive further study of the structure and bioactivity of ASC-J9 and ASC-J15, we were surprised to find that the (substituted phenyl)-propenal moieties shared by these two compounds are actually the core structure(s) that attribute to the potent anti-androgen/AR activity of these compounds but not the entire curcumin-like structure. Based in part on this finding we have generated, by chemically synthesis, numerous new compounds, including compounds that possess one, two, three or four (substituted phenyl)-propenal moieties to further support the concept that a<br>
3	2 2 JUL 2009<br>
 <br>
(substituted phenyl)-propenal moiety is the pharmacophore of these compounds. Results from our study are able to show that the increase in number of these moieties within a compound structure may alter or may increase the anti-androgen/AR activity of the compound. We also demonstrate herein that anti-androgenic activity is present within compounds having a single (substituted phenyl)-propenal moiety. New derivatives, based on our new compounds with at least one (substituted phenyl)-propenal moiety, were also synthesized by the present inventors to elucidate not only the pharmacophore structure but also to evaluate the anti-androgenic and anti-cancer activities. The new compounds, provided herein by the inventors further show significant improvements and optimization of bioactivity, bioavailability, water solubility and other criteria essential for the development of therapeutic drug.<br>

D.       Medical Treatments Incorporating Compounds IIaving At Least One (substituted pIIenyl)-propenal Moieties<br>
Compounds of tIIe present invention were tested for tIIeir effect on steroid receptors and tIIeir effect on cancer cell populations. It was found tIIat compounds of tIIe present invention were able to reduce androgen receptor expression (see FIGS. 3 and 4). FurtIIer investigation demonstrated tIIat compounds of tIIe present invention were able to inIIibit cancer cell growtII (see FIG. 5) and reduce expression of tIIe androgen receptor witIIin cancer cells (see FIGS.6 and 8). TIIe inventors also considered potential mecIIanisms of action or potential patIIways. FIG. 7 supports tIIe inventors' beliefs tIIat tIIe compounds of tIIe present invention induce degradation of<br>
 <br>
the androgen receptor. Thus the activities demonstrated herein support therapeutic or prophylactic treatment against medical conditions such as a variety of cancers and androgen associated disorders.<br>
The present invention includes methods of treating, ameliorating symptoms from or preventing the progression of a variety of medical conditions using the disclosed compounds and compositions, including pharmaceutical and cosmetic formulations. The medical conditions may, at least in part, be modulated by a steroid receptor. Steroid receptors of particular interest may include but are not limited to androgen receptor (AR), progesterone receptor (PR), estrogen receptor (ER), glucocorticoid receptor (GR), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR), retinoic acid receptors (RARs and RXRs), and orphan steroid hormone receptors. Compositions or compounds of the present invention may target a specific receptor, such as the androgen receptor or may target particular receptors witIhn the steroid receptor superfamily.<br>
The methods of the present invention may prevent, treat or ameliorate symptoms from cancers such as but not limited to prostate cancer, liver cancer, bladder cancer, cervical cancer, lung cancer and breast cancer, skin cancer, small cell lung cancer, testicular cancer, lymphoma, leukemia, esophageal cancer, stomach cancer, colon cancer, endometrial cancer, ovarian cancer, central nervous system cancer, and the like. The methods of the present invention may induce cytotoxicity against tumor cells or may inIhbit tumor cell growth. Determining whether a compound or pharmaceutical is beneficial for the treatment or prevention of a particular disease may include testing the compounds or their derivatives in vitro, in vivo in an animal model or with a cell-based assay on a suitable cell line. In the instance of cancer, cell lines having a profile of a cancerous cell, such as cell lines prepared from cancer cells, may be utilized. In some embodiments activities of compounds of the present invention are evaluated for the ability to inIhbit cancer cell growth or proliferation, optionally stimulated with a stimulator, such as DHT. Compounds disclosed herein were specifically shown to reduce growth or proliferation of prostate cancer cells.<br>
In other embodiments, the compounds their derivatives, pharmaceutical compositions and the like are used to prevent, treat or ameliorate symptoms from neurological and neuromuscular disorders such as Kennedy Disease. Spinal and<br>
 <br>
bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA), or Kennedy's disease, is a gender-specific motor neuron disease that affects 1 in every 40,000 males (reviewed by Katsuno et al., 2004). SBMA patients have a mutated androgen receptor containing an expanded polyglutamine tract. The expanded polyglutamine androgen receptor forms aggregates that interfere with cell functioning and is the factor that causes the proximal muscle atrophy associated with SBMA. The methods of the present invention may include relieving the stress caused by aggregate formation by reducing the amount of the mutant AR to a level that could be more easily policed by the cells' native housekeeping macIhnery. The methods of the present invention may including selectively degrading the androgen receptor and thus may be used as a therapy for SBMA. The disclosed compounds that can enhance androgen receptor degradation may suppress the steady-state level of the receptor thus, attenuating the severity of aggregate formation in patients.<br>
Compounds and compositions of present invention may prevent, treat or ameliorate symptoms from androgen related hair disorders. For example, androgenetic alopecia or "male pattern baldness" is hair loss caused by androgen activity on the androgen receptors in follicles and adjacent cells. As another example, Ihrsutism is excessive growth of tIhck dark hair in locations where hair growth in women usually is minimal or absent. Such male-pattern growth of terminal body hair usually occurs in androgen-stimulated locations, such as the face, chest, and areolae. Methods of the present invention may include administering a compound, pharmaceutical or cosmetic formulation to an individual in need of such treatment or prevention.<br>
Compounds and compositions of the present invention may treat inflammation (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis), acne, alopecia, and may accelerate wound healing. Acne is caused by androgen-induced AR activation of sebaceous glands and may therefore be treated by administering a compound capable of preventing or decreasing AR activation. Compounds of the present invention are believed to induce degradation of the androgen receptor and thus would provide an effective treatment against such medical conditions. Androgenetic alopecia and other hair growth disorders are known to cause by the activation of androgen receptors (AR) in hair follicles by endogenous androgen. Certain inflammation conditions and wound healing are also believed to be associated with the androgen receptor in response to androgen. Methods of the<br>
 <br>
present invention may include administering a compound, pharmaceutical or cosmetic formulation to an individual in need of such treatment or prevention. Topical application of such formulations may be of particular interest.<br>
Compounds and compositions of the present invention may be used in the treatment of endocrine disorders. Androgen excess is one of the most common endocrine disorders in women (reviewed by Bulun and AdasIh, 2003).   This pathophysiological status can be found in women with various endocrine disorders, including polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), pituitary adenoma-induced hyperprolactinemia, Cushing's syndrome, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, non-classical adrenal hyperplasia, ovary or adrenal tumor, and iatrogenic androgen excess. Among these disorders, PCOS, occurring in 5-10% of reproductive-age women, is the most frequently identified cause of hyperandrogenism. Recently, a relative increase in the ratio of circulating androgens to circulating estrogens (named as androgenicity) has been observed in post-menopausal women (Lee et al., 2004). Androgenicity is the consequence of a greater decrease in estradiol and estrone synthesis than that of androgen synthesis after menopause, and its clinical implications are under active study. It has been shown that women exIhbiting androgenicity are more frequently seen with central obesity (Peohlman et al., 1995). Fat deposit in the abdominal wall is metabolically active and is associated with insulin resistance in the peripheral tissues (Evans et al., 1983). Other than die above-mentioned endocrine disturbances, hyperandrogenic symptoms can also be detected in human immunodeficiency virus (hlV)-infected women showing lipodystrophy syndrome (hadigan et al., 2000). It has been suggested that hyperandrogenism may be involved in lipid aberrations observed in the latter group of patients.<br>
The methods of the present invention include the treatment of a variety of medical conditions as disclosed herein or are believed to be associated at least in part with a steroid or steroid associated disorder. The methods of treatment include administering a compound, pharmaceutical formulation or cosmetic formulation of the present invention to an individual or subject in need thereof. Subjects may be treated with a therapeutically effective dosage. A therapeutically effective dosage may vary somewhat from compound to compound, patient to patient, and will depend on the condition of the patient and route of delivery. As general guidance, a dosage<br>
 <br>
from about 0.1 to about 50 mg/kg may have therapeutic efficacy, wIhle still Ihgher dosages potentially being employed.<br>
Many of the features of the present invention are explained in greater detail in the following non-limiting examples. Thus the following examples are provided to further illustrate the various aspects and embodiments of the present invention. It is be understood; however, that the invention as fully described herein and as recited in the claims is not intended to be limited by the details of the following examples.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
EXAMPLE 1:   PREPARATION OF COMPOUNDS AND DERIVATIVES HAVING AT LEAST ONE (3,4-ALKOXY OR HYDROXY SUBSTITUTED PHENYL)-PROPENAL MOIETY<br>
In some embodiments, compounds composed of a single (substituted phenyl) propenal core structural unit (monomers) were prepared through standard and advanced organic syntheses. In some embodiments, compounds consisting of two or more (substituted phenyl) propenal core structural moieties were prepared by a condensation of substituted benzaldehydes and 2,4-pentanedion or 3-substituted 2,4-pentanedions by the method known in the literature. Pedersen et al. (Liebigs Ann. Chem., 1557-1569,1985). The desired substituents on the biphenyl ring and on the C4 of conjugation bridge were synthesized either before or after the condensation. The length of conjugation bridge between the two phenyl moieties could be varied from 5 carbons to 11 carbons through synthetic strategies. Properly adding and removing protecting groups allow ultimate synthesis of the disclosed derivatives. In addition, various synthetic steps may be performed in an alternate sequence in order to give the desired compounds.<br>
Derivative phosphate prodrugs were further prepared by reacting compounds having compounds a (substituted phenyl)-propenal moiety with phosphorous oxychloride in an appropriate solvent, e.g., dichloromethane, in the presence of an organic base, e.g., triethylamine.

Representative ASC compounds and monomers were tested for tIIeir activity to block androgen/AR-induced functions. A cell growtII assay using IIuman prostate cancer cells, eitIIer LNCaP or CWR22Rvl, was applied in tIIe studies. Functional AR proteins are expressed in botII cancer cell lines; wIIereas tIIe growtII of LNCaP cells is DIIT dependant, but tIIe growtII of CWR22Rvl cells, derived from a relapsed IIormone-refractory tumor, was not. In addition, Western Blot analysis were performed by testing monomers, and some representative new compounds in prostate cancer cells to demonstrate tIIat compounds witII at least one (4-IIydroxy-3-metIIoxy-pIIenyl)-propenal moiety are capable of reducing AR protein expression levels and inIIibiting cancer cell growtII in vitro.<br>

In vitro Cell Growth Assays using human Prostate Cancer cell lines. LNCaP and CWR22Rvl<br>
The MTT cell proliferation assay was applied in the present invention to detect the capability of compounds to suppress or inIhbit prostate cancer cells growth. The MTT assay, wIhch is a method widely used to detect proliferation of culture cells and is relied upon the conversion of a colorless substrate to reduced tetrazolium by a mitochondrial dehydrogenase (possessed by all viable cells), and has been demonstrated previously (Su et al, 1999) to assess the growth of various tissue-cultured cells. Briefly, 1 x 103 LNCaP or CWR22RV1 cells suspended in complete medium were plated into each well of a 96-well Microtest Ih tissue culture plate (Falcon, NJ). Two days later, the medium was replaced with RPMI-1640 medium containing 10% charcoal/dextran-deprived FBS (hormone-deprived fetal bovine serum). Testing compounds were added to the medium at indicated concentrations with or without 1 nM DhT and cells were cultured for 5 days in an incubator (at 37 °C). MTT substrate solution (5 mg/ml in PBS) in 1/10 of volume was added to the cells in each well at 2 hours before harvesting. After 2 hour incubation, the plates were centrifuged (10 min at 1,000 rpm) and the supernatant from each well was carefully removed. A 100 μl of lysis buffer (50% dimethyl formamide, 5% sodium dodecyl sulphate, 0.35 M acetic acid, and 50 raM hC1) was added to each well to lyse the cells and dissolved tetrazolium in each well. The relative quantity of enzyme activity from each well was measured based on absorbance read at a wavelength of 450 nm using a Bio-RAD BenchMark microplate reader.  Data derived from the MTT assay were also verified by the actual cell count and cell morphology on a separate plate set up in parallel.  Data from tIhs parallel plate demonstrated a positive relationsIhp between the quantity of enzyme activity and the number of viable cells in the well.<br>
Western Blot Analysis of AR Protein Expression Levels in Prostate Cancer Cells<br>
A widely used Western Blotting analysis was employed to measure AR protein expression level. human prostate cancer cells, LNCaP and CWR22Rvl, both express Ihgh levels of AR proteins and were used in tIhs study. In tIhs invention representative ASC compounds were tested in Western blot assay to evaluate their<br>
 <br>
activity in reducing AR expression; and the assays were carried out in either the presence or absence of dihydrotestosterone (DHT, 1 nM). After cells were incubated with testing compounds for the designated time, they were harvested and lysed according to Western Blot techniques known in the biochemical arts. Details of Western Blotting analysis method have been published previously (Su et al., 1999). Briefly, cells were harvested either in 2x sodium dodecyl sulphate/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS/PAGE) loading buffer or in Radio-Immunoprecipitation Assay (RIPA) lysis buffer strengthened with 10 μg/ml of benzamidine, 10 μg/ml of trypsin inIhbitor, and 1 mM of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. A sample of total protein (approximately 40 μg) from each cell lysate was separated by electrophoresis on a SDS/PAGE gel. After separation by electrophoresis, the proteins were transferred from the gel to a nitrocellulose membrane following the standard procedures. The membrane was then incubated with 10% non-fat milk in phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 0.1% Tween-20 (PBST) for 1 hour and then followed with an overnight incubation with a primary human AR-specific antibody (purchased from BD-PharMingen) at 4°C. After incubation, the membrane was rinsed with PBST buffer three times; 10 min each time; an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibody was then added and incubated for 1 hour at room temperature. After second antibody incubation, membrane was again rinsed with PBST, and AR protein signal in the membrane was visualized by adding alkaline phosphatase substrates, bromochloroindolyl phosphate and nitro blue tetrazolium to the membrane. To assure that an equal amount of protein from each sample was analyzed, a portion of the membrane was stained with a specific antibody for a house keeping protein β-actin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and actin signal was revealed with a second antibody as described above. The protein signal intensity (shown as colour band on the membrane) was measured using densitometer and analysed by using NIH  Image J software (NIH 1.33). The quantity of AR protein was calculated by normalizing the quantity of AR to the quantity of β-actin in each sample and data are expressed in relative quantity.<br>

Detection of AR degradation using a cvcloheximide chasing assay method:<br>
AR protein "degradation" in prostate cancer cells was measured by using cycloheximide (a protein synthesis inIhbitor) chasing assay method. Briefly, LNCaP cells were incubated with testing ASC compound at the designated concentrations for 24 hours. Subsequently, cycloheximide was added to the cells at a concentration of 15 μg/ml to block new protein synthesis. After incubation, cells were harvested at designated time periods and the resultant change in AR protein levels were analysed using Western Blot analysis as described above.<br>
