AUKOXY SUBSTITUTED IMIDAZOQUINOLINES<br>
CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION The present application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application Serial No. 60J508634, filed on October 3, 2003, which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
In the 1950's the 1H-imidazo[4,5-c]quinoline ring system was developed, and l-{6-me1hoxy-8-quinohnyl)-2-melhyl-lH-imida2o[4,5-c]quinoline was synthesized for possible use as an antimalarial agent Subsequently, syntheses of various substituted 1H-imidazo[4,5-c]quinolines were reported. For example, l-[2-(4-piperidyI)ethyrj-lH'-imidazo[4,5-c]quinoline was synthesized as a possible anticonvulsant and cardiovascular agent. Also, several 2-oxoimidazo[4,5-c]quinolines have been reported.<br>
Certain liy-imidazo[4,5-c]qumolin-4-amines and 1- and 2-substituted derivatives thereof were later found to be useful as antiviral agents, bronchodilators and immunomodulators. Subsequently, certain substituted lH-imidazo[4,5-c]pyridin-4-amine, quinolin-4-amine, tetrahydroquinoun-4-amine, naphthyridin-4-amine, and tetrahydronaphiiiyridin-4-aminee compounds as well as certain analogous thiazolo and oxazolo compounds were synthesized and found to be useful as immune response modifiers (IRMs), rendering them useful in the treatment of a variety of disorders.<br>
There continues to be interest in and a need for compounds that have the ability to modulate the immune response, by induction of cytokine biosynthesis or other<br><br>
SUMMARY<br>
A new class of compounds useful for modulating cytokine biosynthesis has now been found. In one aspect, the present invention provides such compounds, which are of Formula I:<br><br><br>
wherein R, n, R1, R", and R3 are as defined below; and phannaceuticaly acceptable salts thereof.<br>
The compounds of the present invention are useful as immune response modifiers (IRMs) due to their ability to induce or inhibit cytokine biosynthesis (e.g, induce ox inhibit the biosynthesis or production of one or more cytokines) and otherwise modulate the immune response when administered to animals. Compounds can be tested per the test procedures described in the Examples Section. Compounds can be tested for induction of cytokine biosynthesis by incubating human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) in<br>
t<br>
a culture with the compound(s) at a concentration range of 30 to 0.014 uM and analyzing for interferon (a) or tumor necrosis factor (a) in the culture supernatant. Compounds can be tested for inhibition of cytokine biosynthesis by incubating mouse macrophage cell line Raw 264.7 in a culture with the compound(s) at a single concentration of, for example, 5 uM and analyzing for tumor necrosis factor (a) in the culture supernatant The ability to modulate cytokine biosynthesis, for example, induce the biosynthesis of one or more cytokines, makes the compounds useful in the treatment of a variety of conditions such as viral diseases and neoplastic diseases, that are responsive to such changes in the immune response.<br>
In another aspect, the present invention provides pharmaceutical compositions containing the immune response modifier compounds, and methods of inducing or inhibiting cytokine biosynthesis in an animal treating a viral disease in an animal and treating a neoplastic disease in an animal, by administering an effective amount of one or more compounds of Formula I andJor pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof to the animal.<br>
hi another aspect, the invention provides methods of synthesizing compounds of Formula I and intermediates useful in the synthesis of these compounds.<br><br>
As used herein, "a," "an," "the," "at least one," and "one or more" are used interchangeably.<br>
The terms "comprising" and variations thereof do not have a limiting meaning where these terms appear in the description and claims.<br>

The synthesis of 2-(ethoxyme&amp;yl)-l-fnopyl-lJ7-iibb	is<br>
described in Parts A-I of Example 2. The general method duuibtd in Pat L of Example 2 was followed. 2-(EthoxymethyI)-l-propyI-Lff-inrida2o[4b-c}qoinofiij-8-oI (4.43 g, 15.5 mmol) was treated with fert-bulyl 6-iodohcryicaibamate (pnpatoi as desaribed in Part F of Example 45,6.1 g, 18.6 mmol). After the work âp, the crwfc product was not purified<br><br>
to yield 9.9 g of tert-butyl 6-{[2be1hoxymediyl)-l-prop5d-lff-iiiridazo[44b]quinoHn-8-yl]oxy}hexylcarbamate as a tan waxy solid that contained DMF and dichloromefhane. PartB<br>

The aqueous layer was extracted with dichloromethane (2 x 100 mL). The organic layers were combined, washed with 5% aqueous sodium bicarbonate, water, and saturated aqueous sodium chloride. The organic layer was then dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated under reduced pressure. The aiide product was purified by flabchrcbnalography (silica gel, gradient elution 1-5% methanol in dichloromethane) to afford 4.60 g of terf-butyi 6-{[4-ammo-2-(emoxymethyl)-l-propyl-ljy-rmidazo[4,5b]quinoIm-8-yl]oxy}hexylcarbamate as a tan solid that contained some impurities but was used in the next step without further purification. PartC<br>
A solution of the material from Part B in 4.0 M ethanolic hydrogen chloride (22<br>
mL) was heated at reflux for 1 hour. The solution was allowed to cool to room<br>
temperature and was concentrated under reduced pressure to yield an aflyiessiae. Water<br>
(approximately 10 mL) and saturated aqueous sodium rhXcm&amp;i (10 mL) were added to the<br>
oily residue, then the solution was adjusted to approTijirrfirJy pH 33 wife 50% aqueous<br>
