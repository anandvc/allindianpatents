Other aqueous solvents may also be used in the said crystallisation of the Hydrate, for example methanol, acetonitrile or ethyl acetate or mixtures thereof. The precise amount of water used in each of the alternative solvents will depend upon the particular solvent chosen, for example approximately 3% by volume in acetonitrile or ethyl acetate. Methanolhas also been shown to provide the hydrate when the crystallisation is conducted open to the atmosphere. Water can also be used as the crystallization solvent.<br>
Compound I is prepared according to known procedures, such as those<br>
disclosed in WO94/05659. The disclosures of WO94/05659 are incorporated herein<br>
by reference.	<br>
When used herein the term 'prophylaxis of conditions associated with diabetes mellitus' includes the treatment of conditions such as insulin resistance, impaired glucose tolerance, hyperinsulinaemia and gestational diabetes.<br>
Diabetes mellitus preferably means Type II diabetes mellitus.<br>
Conditions associated with diabetes include hyperglycaemia and insulin resistance, especially acquired insulin resistance and obesity. Further conditions associated with diabetes include hypertension, cardiovascular disease, especially atherosclerosis, certain eating disorders, in particular the regulation of appetite and food intake in subjects suffering from disorders associated with under-eating ,such as anorexia nervosa, and disorders associated with over-eating, such as obesity and anorexia bulimia. Additional conditions associated with diabetes include polycystic ovarian syndrome and steroid induced insulin resistance.<br>
The complications of conditions associated with diabetes mellitus encompassed herein includes renal disease, especially renal disease associated with the development of Type II diabetes including diabetic nephropathy, glornerulonephritis, glomerular sclerosis, nephrotic syndrome, hypertensive nephrosclerosis and end stage renal disease.<br>
As mentioned above the compound of the invention has useful therapeutic properties: The present invention accordingly the Hydrate for use as an active therapeutic substance.<br>
More particularly, the present invention provides the Hydrate for use in the treatment and/or prophylaxis of diabetes mellitus, conditions associated with diabetes mellitus and certain complications thereof.<br>
The Hydrate may be administered per se or, preferably, as a pharmaceutical composition also comprising a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The formulation of the Hydrate and dosages thereof are generally as disclosed for Compound (I) in International Patent Application, Publication Number WO94/05659.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention also provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising the Hydrate and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier therefor.<br>
The Hydrate is normally administered in unit dosage form.<br>
The active compound may be administered by any suitable route but usually by the oral or parenteral routes. For such use, the compound will normally be employed in the form of a pharmaceutical composition in association with a pharmaceutical carrier, diluent and/or excipient, although the exact form of the composition will naturally depend on the mode of administration.<br>
Compositions are prepared by admixture and are suitably adapted for oral, parenteral or topical administration, and as such may be in the form of tablets, capsules, oral liquid preparations, powders, granules, lozenges, pastilles, reconstitutable powders, injectable and infusable solutions or suspensions, suppositories and transdermal devices. Orally administrable compositions are preferred, in particular shaped oral compositions, since they are more convenient for general use.<br>
Tablets and capsules for oral administration are usually presented in a unit dose, and contain conventional excipients such as binding agents, fillers, diluents, tabietting agents, lubricants, disintegrants, colourants, flavourings, and wetting agents. The tablets may be coated according to well known methods in the art.<br>
Suitable fillers for use include cellulose, mannitol, lactose and other similar agents. Suitable disintegrants include starch, polyvinylpyrrolidone and starch derivatives such as sodium starch glycollate. Suitable lubricants include, for example, magnesium stearate. Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable wetting agents include sodium lauryl sulphate.<br>
Solid oral compositions may be prepared by conventional methods of blending, filling, tabletting or the like. Repeated blending operations may be used to distribute the active agent throughout those compositions employing large quantities of fillers. Such operations are, of course, conventional in the art.<br>
Oral liquid preparations may be in the form of, for example, aqueous or oily suspensions, solutions, emulsions, syrups, or elixirs, or may be presented as a dry<br>
product for reconstitution with water or other suitable vehicle before use. Such liquid preparations may contain conventional additives such as suspending agents, for example sorbitol, syrup, methyl cellulose, gelatin, hydroxyethylcellulose, carboxymethyl cellulose, aluminium stearate gel or hydrogenated edible fats, emulsifying agents, for example lecithin, sorbitan monooleate, or acacia; non-aqueous vehicles (which may include edible oils), for example, almond oil, fractionated coconut oil, oily esters such as esters of glycerine, propylene glycol, or ethyl alcohol; preservatives, for example methyl or propyl g-hydroxybenzoate or sorbic acid, and if desired conventional flavouring or colouring agents.<br>
For parenteral administration, fluid unit dose forms are prepared containing a compound of the present invention and a sterile vehicle. The compound, depending on the vehicle and the concentration, can be either suspended or dissolved. Parenteral solutions are normally prepared by dissolving the active compound in a vehicle and filter sterilising before filling into a suitable vial or ampoule and sealing. Advantageously, adjuvants such as a local anaesthetic, preservatives and buffering agents are also dissolved in the vehicle. To enhance the stability, the composition can be frozen after filling into the vial and the water removed under vacuum.<br>
Parenteral suspensions are prepared in substantially the same manner except that the active compound is suspended in the vehicle instead of being dissolved and sterilised by exposure to ethylene oxide before suspending in the sterile vehicle. Advantageously, a surfactant or wetting agent is included in the composition to facilitate uniform distribution of the active compound.<br>
In addition such compositions may contain further active agents such as anti-hypertensive agents and diuretics.<br>
As is common practice, the compositions will usually be accompanied by written or printed directions for use in the medical treatment concerned.<br>
As used herein the term 'pharmaceutically acceptable' embraces compounds, compositions and ingredients for both human and veterinary use: for example the term 'pharmaceutically acceptable salt' embraces a veterinarily acceptable salt.<br>
The present invention further provides a method for the treatment and/or prophylaxis of diabetes mellitus, conditions associated with diabetes mellitus and certain complications thereof, in a human or non-human mammal which comprises administering an effective, non-toxic, amount of the Hydrate to a human or non-human mammal in need thereof.<br>
Conveniently, the active ingredient may be administered as a pharmaceutical composition hereinbefore defined, and this forms a particular aspect of the present invention.<br>
In the treatment and/or prophylaxis of diabetes mellitus, conditions associated with diabetes mellitus and certain complications thereof the Hydrate may be taken in doses, such as those described above.<br>
Similar dosage regimens are suitable for the treatment and/or prophylaxis of non-human mammals.<br>
In a further aspect the present invention provides the use of the Hydrate for the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment and/or prophylaxis of diabetes mellitus, conditions associated with diabetes mellitus and certain complications thereof.<br>
No adverse toxicological effects are indicated in the aboVe mentioned treatments for the compounds of the invention.<br>
