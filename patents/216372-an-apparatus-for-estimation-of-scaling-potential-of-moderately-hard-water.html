				<td>Field of Invention<br>
The present invention relates to an apparatus for estimating the scaling potential of<br>
moderately hard water with respect to varying parameters either individually or collectively.<br>
More particularly the invention relates to an apparatus adapted to estimate the scaling<br>
potential of water through variation of temperature and pH and variation of total hardness,<br>
alkalinity and total dissolved solids.<br>
Background of Invention<br>
Scale formation, especially calcium scale formation, is a universal phenomenon, which is<br>
frequently found in closed type (like boiler, feed-water line), open type and mixed type water<br>
body/systems Scaling is a function of five parameters namely pH, temperature, total<br>
hardness, alkalinity and total dissolved solids. In addition certain constructional features like<br>
constrictions and bends enhance scale formation.<br>
Scaling is a complex phenomenon and interactions among parameters depend on typical<br>
water body/system. However, there exists no standard method for securing scaling data.<br>
Often on-site method is followed placing "coupons" at critical point, which is highly time<br>
consuming.<br>
At present the study of the impact due to combined variation of critical parameters is virtually<br>
impossible. Only way to study the effect of individual parameters on scaling in the laboratory<br>
is to carry out multiple tests through different methods/equipment such as:<br>
Drawbacks of known art<br>
The main disadvantage of the presently available apparatus for estimating the scaling<br>
potential of water is that there exists no means to study the combined effect of the aforesaid<br>
parameters.<br>
Another disadvantage is that carrying out tests in different test set-up/apparatus for<br>
analyzing individual scaling parameters is extremely cumbersome, costly and time<br>
consuming.<br>
A further disadvantage is that there exists no unified laboratory method of obtaining scaling<br>
data, therefore, data is generated in a discrete manner.<br>
One more disadvantage is that no single apparatus exits for studying variation in all the<br>
major parameters on scaling, either individually or collectively.<br>
The other disadvantage is the development of individual process simulator is extremely<br>
difficult.<br>
Thus there is a need to provide an apparatus for studying the impact of the combined<br>
variation of critical scaling parameters or the effect of individual parameters on scaling in<br>
moderately hard water in a reduced time.<br>
Objects of invention<br>
The basic object of the present invention is to provide an apparatus, which is capable of<br>
estimating scaling parameters of water either taking into account all parameters collectively<br>
or individually.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to estimate the scaling potential of water through<br>
variation of temperature and pH of water on flow and variation of inherent total hardness,<br>
alkalinity and total dissolved solids.<br>
A further object of the present invention is to provide an apparatus, which is compatible for <br>
studying the impact of variation of all the major parameters on scaling individually or <br>
collectively.<br>
One more object of the present invention is to serve the purpose of determining the<br>
effectiveness of various generic and non-generic scale inhibitors in a variable scaling<br>
environment.<br>
The other object of the present invention is to provide an apparatus that would be useful as a<br>
decision making tool for necessary preventive and corrective treatment of water while<br>
predicting the behaviour of water.<br>
Summary of invention<br>
Thus according to main aspects of the present invention there is provided an apparatus for<br>
estimation of the scaling potential of moderately hard water either taking into account all<br>
parameters individually or collectively comprising:<br>
(i) means to provide accelerated scaling process;<br>
(ii) means to provide adjustable flow rate of water from the feed water tank to the<br>
collection tank;<br>
(iii) a dosing line connected to the said feed water tank;<br>
(iv) heating element provided in the feed water tank;<br>
(v) controller means connected to the feed water tank;<br>
wherein the scaling potential of the water is estimated at varying parameters selected from<br>
pH, temperature, total dissolved solids/hardness and the like by evaluating the amount of<br>
scales deposited in the said means to provide accelerated scaling process when the water<br>
flows from the feed water tank to the collection tank through said means.<br>
Detailed description of invention<br>
The apparatus of the present invention comprises a feed-water tank adapted for the storing<br>
the water, whose scaling parameters are required to be estimated. The feed-water tank is<br>
provided with means to provide accelerated scaling process, which is glass coil (s) of very<br>
small aperture (2 to 4 mm). The feed-water flows through this glass coil by the action of<br>
gravity to the constant temperature bath. The glass coil is provided with curvatures at certain<br>
points adapted to offer resistance to the flow of water thus enhancing the scale formation.<br>
A stirrer has also been incorporated in the tank for stirring the water whenever inhibitors or<br>
acids are added to it. A dosing line provided with the feed-water tank is adapted to add<br>
inhibitors, acids, base etc. to the feed-water.<br>
The feed-water tank is provided with a heating element adapted for maintaining different<br>
temperatures of the feed-water in the tank. The estimation apparatus is provided with<br>
controller means comprising temperature controller, which is adapted to obtain differential<br>
temperature between the constant temperature bath and feed-water tank accelerating scale<br>
formation. The constant temperature bath is also adapted for effluent temperature of water<br>
between room temperature and boiling point of water. The said controller means is further<br>
provided with pH controlling arrangement adapted for maintaining different values of pH in<br>
the feed-water tank.<br>
The means to provide adjustable flow rate of water from the feed water tank to the collection<br>
tank is a rubber tubing at the junction joining the glass coil line with the feed-water line<br>
controls the flow rate of the water to the constant temperature bath. An add-on component<br>
called the pH controller is incorporated in the apparatus adapted to control the pH of the<br>
feed-water in the tank.<br>
A collection tank with the provision to recycle the water to the feed-water tank is adapted to<br>
collect the water coming from the feed-water tank via the constant temperature bath.<br>
The temperature controller, the pH controller and the dosing line vary the internal conditions<br>
(water properties) and external conditions (temperature and pH) to generate different scaling<br>
data.<br>
The estimation is carried out by measuring the amount of scale deposited in the glass coil.<br>
The coils are dried and weighed before and after each test determining the amount of<br>
scale formation. The parameters are evaluated by both variation of (pH, temperature etc.)<br>
and variations of total hardness, alkalinity and total dissolved solids. After passage<br>
of water through pre-weighed coils, the coils are dried and weighed. Consequently,<br>
accelerated scaling rate is calculated. Scaling phenomenon gets simulated since scaling is<br>
basically precipitation of dissolved material on a surface. High surface area per unit volume<br>
of water accelerates scaling process. Comparison of scaling potential can be done for either<br>
different streams of water or through parametric variation of a single stream of water. The<br>
degree of scaling can be gauged either by comparison of different stream of water or by<br>
comparing them with any normal (non-scale forming) water.<br>
Though scaling is a strong function of pH, temperature, total hardness, alkalinity and total<br>
dissolved solids, all these parameters are not fully independent parameters. Alkalinity is<br>
proportional to pH and total dissolved solids are proportional to total hardness. The<br>
combined effect of the parameters signifying comparison of scaling potential with different<br>
sets of data like different values of hardness, alkalinity and TDS of water collected from a<br>
recirculating water system at different points of time are given in Table-1.<br>
Multi parametric variation accompanied by changes in temperatures and pH in the<br>
estimation of the scaling potential is given in Table-2.<br>
The best possible efficiency in estimating the scale formation potential of water is achieved<br>
using the apparatus in the temperature range of 10 °C to 80 °C.<br>
Brief description of accompanying figures<br>
Figure 1 illustrates the apparatus for estimation of scaling potential.<br>
Figure 2 is a graph of temperature differential vs. accelerated scaling rate.<br>
Figure 3 is a graph of scale inhibitor vs. accelerated scaling rate.<br>
Figure 4 is a graph of temperature differential vs. accelerated scaling rate.<br>
In figure 1 feed-water tank (1) is provided with a stirrer (2) for stirring the water whenever<br>
inhibitors or acids are added to the water to vary the TDS. The feed-water line (3) from the<br>
feed-water tank (1) is connected to the glass coils (4) immersed in the constant temperature<br>
bath (5). The rubber tubing (6), which controls the flow rate connects the coils (4) with the<br>
feed-water line (3). The feed-water tank (1) is provided with a heating element (12) adapted<br>
for maintaining different temperatures of the feed-water in the tank (1). The temperature<br>
controller (7) and pH controller (8) is connected to both feed-water tank (1) and constant<br>
temperature bath (5) and provide variable temperature and pH values.<br>
The collection tank (9) is provided with a recycle line (10) connecting the collection tank (9)<br>
to the feed-water tank (1).<br>
A dosing line (11) in the feed-water tank (1) adds inhibitors, acid, base etc.<br>
In figure 2 a graph illustrates scaling rates at various differential temperatures. The x-axis<br>
represents the temperature differential in °C and the y-axis represents the accelerated<br>
scaling rate in gm/m3. The accelerated scaling rate is fast till the temperature is 30 °C and<br>
after that value of the scaling rate comes to a saturation point. The graph indicates that<br>
higher the differential temperature higher is the scaling rate.<br>
In figure 3 the impact of scale inhibitor on accelerated scaling is described. The x-axis<br>
represents the scale inhibitor in ppm and the y-axis represents accelerated scaling rate in<br>
gm/m3. The scaling rate is indirectly proportional to ppm of the scale inhibitor. There is a<br>
sharp decrease in the scale rate up to 20 ppm after which the rate slows down flattening the<br>
curve.<br>
Figure 4 describes the variation in scaling rate due to temperature differentials and scale<br>
inhibitors at 10 ppm. Here x-axis represents temperature differentials in °C and y-axis<br>
represents accelerated scaling rate in gm/m3. At 10 °C the scaling is just above 0.8, which<br>
gradually increases till 1.2 at the temperature of about 30 °C. After that with the increase of<br>
temperature rate of scaling starts decreasing.<br>
Calculation<br>
Accelerated scaling rate = (final weight-initial weight)/volume of water passed<br>
The key variables are:<br>
i) Variation and control of flow from feed-water tank.<br>
ii) Variation and control of temperature in feed-water tank.<br>
iii) Variation and control of temperature in constant temperature bath.<br>
iv) Variation and control of pH in feed-water tank.<br>
v) Variation in acid/base dosing.<br>
vi) Variation in inhibitor chemical dosing.<br>
vii) Recycling of water.<br>
