[DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION]<br>
[0001]<br>
[Technical field of the invention] The present invention relates to a seating de¬tecting device for a motorcycle wherein a front end of a seat covering a storage box fixed to a rear portion of a venicle frame is opematbly and closably sappoited on an upper portion of a front end of the storage box, with the seat being vertically movable while closing the storage box, an arm member vertically movable in unison with said seat is resiliently urged upwardly, and a seat switch disposed beneath the arm member for detecting vertical movement of said arm member is mounted on the storage box . [0002]<br>
[Prior art]<br><br>
Heretofore, such a seating detecting device has already been known from Japanese laid-open utility model publication No. 2-44591, for example. [0003]<br>
[Problems to be solved by the invention]<br>
In the above conventional seating detecting de¬vice, an end of an arm member in the form of a leaf spring is fastened to a storage'box, and the other end of the arm member is coupled to a hinge pin by which a front end of a seat is vertically angularly movably supported on the storage box, and a seat switch is mounted on the storage box in contact with a lower surface of an inter¬mediate portion of the arm member.  Thus, the arm member extends between the storage box and the seat,.  Therefore, it is difficult to position the arm member and the seat switch relatively to each other highly accurately, and the cost of manufacturing the seating detecting device is high in order to achieve a desired level of accuracy. [0004]<br>
The present invention has been made in view of the above drawbacks.  It is an object of the present in¬vention to provide a seating detecting device for a mo¬torcycle which is capable of highly accurately detecting when a driver is seated on a seat.<br><br>
[0005]<br>
[Means for solving the problems]<br>
To achieve the above object, there is provided in accordance with an invention described in claim 1 a seat¬ing detecting device for a motorcycle wherein a front end of a seat covering a storage box fixed to a rear portion of a vehicle frame is openably and closably supported on an upper portion of a front end of the storage box, with the seat being vertically movable while closing the stor¬age box, an arm member vertically movable in unison with the seat is resiliently urged upwardly, and a seat switch disposed beneath the arm member for detecting vertical movement of the arm member is mounted on the storage box, characterized in that the storage box has a limiting sur¬face for abutting against an upper surface of the arm member whose one end is supported on the storage box to limit an upward movement end of the arm member, and a transmitting member vertically movable in unison with the seat is disposed upwardly of the arm member so as to be able to abut against an upper surface of the arm member. [0006]<br>
With the above arrangement, the arm member dis¬posed above the seat switch mounted on the storage box is mounted on the storage box with its upper limit position<br><br>
switch is mounted on the storage box so as to be pressed against the positioning surface from below, the relative position of the seat switch with respect to the storage box can be determined easily and highly accurately. [0009]<br>
In addition to the above arrangement of the in¬vention described in claim 1 or 3, an invention described in claim 4 is characterized in that said seat switch is fastened to the storage box from below the storage box. With this arrangement, it is easy to determine the verti¬cal relative position of the seat switch with respect to the arm member highly accurately.  Particularly, if the upper limit position of the seat switch is limited by the positioning surface, then the accuracy of the vertical relative position of the seat switch with respect to the arm member can easily be increased. [0010]<br>
In addition to the above arrangement of the in¬vention described in claim 4, an invention described in claim 5 is characterized in that the storage box has a downwardly facing fastening surface to which the seat switch is fastened and a downwardly facing positioning surface for limiting an upper limit position of the seat switch with respect to the storage box, said fastening<br><br>
limited by the limiting surface, and the transmitting member vertically movable in unison with the seat is dis¬posed for abutment against the upper surface of the arm member.  Therefore, it is possible to position the arm member and the seat switch relatively to each other highly accurately on the storage box, and the seat switch is capable of highly accurately detecting when the driver is seated on the seat. [0007]<br>
In addition to the above arrangement of the in¬vention described in claim 1, an invention described in claim 2 is characterized in that the transmitting member comprises a hinge pin by which the front end of the seat is vertically angularly movably supported on said storage box.  With this arrangement, no parts dedicated to the transmitting member are required, and the number of parts used can be reduced. [0008]<br>
In addition to the above arrangement of the in¬vention described in claim 1, an invention described in claim 3 is characterized in that the storage box has a downwardly facing positioning surface for limiting an up¬per limit position of the seat switch with respect to the storage box.  With this arrangement, inasmuch as the seat<br><br>
surface and the positioning surface lying substantially parallel to the limiting surface.  With this arrangement, the seat switch can easily be mounted on the storage box. [0011]<br>
In addition to the above arrangement of the in¬vention described in claim 2, an invention described in Claim  6 is characterized in that when no one is seated on said seat which is resiliently urged upwardly with the Storage box being closed, a predetermined gap is created between the hinge pin and the arm member.  With this ar¬rangement, the relative positional accuracy of the arm member with respect to the seat switch is prevented from being lowered by forces applied from the seat to the arm member which is mounted on the storage box with the in¬creased relative positional accuracy with respect to the seat switch.<br><br>
Accordingly there is provided a seating . detecting device for a 'motorcycle wherein a front end of a seat covering a storage box fixed to a rear portion of a vehicle frame (F) is openably and closably supported on an upper portion of a front end of the storage box, with the. seat being vertically movable while closing the storage box, an arm member vertically movable in unison with said seat is resiliently urged upwardly, and a seat switch disposed beneath the arm member for detecting vertical movement of said arm member is mounted on said storage box, characterized in that said storage box has a limiting surface for abutting against an upper surface of the arm member whose one end is supported on the storage box to limit an upward movement end of the arm member, and a transmitting member vertically movable in unison with said seat is disposed upwardly of the arm member so as to be able to abut against an upper surface of the arm member.<br><br><br>

the down frame 15.  The rear frame 12 is fastened to rear<br>
ends of the floor support frames 16.<br>
[0015]<br>
A front fork 17 disposed astride of a front wheel WF is steerably supported on the head pipe 14 on the front end of the front frame 11.  The front fork 17 has a lower end positioned forwardly of an axle 18 of the front wheel WF.  A link 19 has an end coupled to the lower end of the front fork 17 and another end coupled to the axle 18.  A front cushion 20 is connected between a vertically intermediate portion of the front fork 17 and an interme¬diate portion of the link 19.  A steering handle 21 is connected to an upper end of the front fork 17 . [0016]<br>
A power unit P comprises an engine E disposed forwardly of a rear wheel WR and a continuously variable transmission M disposed laterally to the left of the rear wheel WR is swingably supported on a longitudinally in¬termediate portion of the rear frame 12 by a vibroisolat-ing link 22.  The engine E comprises a water-cooled sin¬gle-cylinder 4-cycle engine with its cylinder directed forwardly of and substantially horizontal to the vehicle, for example.  The continuously variable transmission M comprises a belt-type transmission, for example.<br><br>
[0017]<br>
The rear wheel WR is supported on a rear portion of the power unit P by an axle, and a rear cushion unit 23 is disposed between the rear portion of the power unit P and the rear frame 12.  An air cleaner 24 disposed lat¬erally of an upper portion of the rear wheel WR is mount¬ed on the rear portion of the power unit P, and connected to the engine E by a carburetor 25.  An exhaust pipe 26 for discharging exhaust gases from the engine E extends from the engine E laterally to the right of the rear wheel WR.  The exhaust pipe 26 is connected to an exhaust muffler 27 which is disposed laterally to the right of the rear wheel WR.  A stand 28 is angularly movably sup¬ported on the engine E. [0018]<br>
A storage box 29 of synthetic resin for storing a helmet, etc. is fixed to a rear portion of the vehicle frame F, i.e., an upper surface of an intermediate por¬tion of the rear frame 12, above the engine E and the carburetor 25.  A fuel tank 30 is supported on the aux¬iliary frame 13. [0019]<br>
The vehicle frame F is covered with a vehicle cover 31 of synthetic resin.  The vehicle cover 31 com-<br><br>
prises a leg shield 31a for covering a front area of the legs of the driver, a step floor 31b contiguous to a low¬er portion of the leg shield 31a for supporting the feet of the driver thereon, an under cover 31c covering a low¬er area of the step floor 31b and contiguous to the leg shield 31a and the step floor 31b, and a side cover 31d contiguous to the step floor 31b and the under cover 31c and covering both sides of the rear portion of the vehi¬cle . [0020]<br>
Most of the storage box 29 supported on the rear frame 12 and the fuel tank 30 supported on the auxiliary frame 13 are covered with the side cover 31d.  A seat 32 which can cover the storage box 29 from above is openably and closably mounted on an upper portion of the side cover 31d.  The fuel tank 30 has a fuel inlet cap 40a disposed so as to project upwardly from an upper portion of the side cover 31d. [0021]<br>
As also shown in FIG. 2, a bracket 33 projecting forwardly is integrally formed with an upper portion of the front end of the storage box 29, and a hinge plate 34 fastened to the front end of the seat 32 is angularly movably supported on the bracket 33 by a hinge pin 35.<br><br>
Therefore, the seat 32 is supported on the front end of the storage box 29 for vertical angular movement to open and close the storage box 29.  The hinge pin 35 is sup¬ported on the bracket 33 for vertical movement in a pre¬set range with respect to the storage box 29.  A rubber seal 36 held in contact with the full circumferential up¬per edge of an opening in the storage box 29 is bonded to a lower surface of the seat 32.  The rubber seal 36 serves to seal the gap between the seat 32 and the stor¬age box 29 when the storage box 29 is closed by the seat 32, and also to resiliently urge the seat 32 upwardly. Therefore, the seat 32 is openably and closably supported on the storage box 29 and vertically movable in a range to compress the rubber seal 36 while closing the storage box 29. [0022]<br>
As also shown in FIGS. 3 through 6, vertically oblong support holes 37 are'defined in left and right sides of the bracket 33.  The hinge pin 35 whose opposite ends are supported by the hinge plate 34 is inserted in the support holes 37.  The hinge pin 35 is thus supported on the bracket 33 for vertical movement with respect to the storage box 29 in a range determined by the support holes 37.<br><br><br>
[0023]<br>
A shaft 38 having an axis parallel to the hinge pin 35 is angularly movably mounted on the bracket 33 rearwardly of the hinge pin 35.  The arm member 39 has an end fixed to an axially central portion of the shaft 38. The arm member 39 extends forwardly from the shaft 38, and the other end of the arm member 39 is disposed be¬neath the hinge pin 35 such that the hinge pin 35 can abut against an upper surface of the other end of the arm member 39 from above.  Therefore, the hinge pin 35 as a transmitting member vertically movable in unison with the seat 32 can abut, from above, against the upper surface of the other end of the arm member 39 which is angularly movably supported on the bracket 33 of the storage box 29 by the shaft.38.<br>
[0024]<br>
A torsion spring 40 is disposed between the bracket 33 and the arm member 39 to exert spring forces for turning the arm member 39 upwardly.  The bracket 33 has an integral limiting projection 41 projecting down¬wardly toward the arm member 39 between the hinge pin 35 and the shaft 38.  The limiting projection 41 has on its tip end a flat limiting surface 42 for abutting against<br><br>
the upper surface of the arm member 39 to limit an upward movement end of the arm member 39. [0025]<br>
When no one is seated on the seat 32 which is re-siliently urged upwardly by the rubber seal 36 while closing the storage box 29, a gap 55 is created between the arm member 39 which is held against the limiting sur¬face 42 to limit its upward movement end and the hinge pin 35, as shown in FIGS. 4 and 5. ' [0026]<br>
Vertical movement of the arm member 39 is detect¬ed by a seat switch 43.  The seat switch 43 is disposed downwardly of the arm member 39 and has a probe 45 pro¬jecting from a switch case 44 and held in contact with the lower surface of the arm member 39 between the limit¬ing surface 42 and the shaft 38. [0027]<br>
The switch case 44 of the seat switch 43 is fas¬tened to a stay 46 by a screw 47 and a welded nut 48. The stay 46 is fastened to the bracket 33 of the storage box 29. [0028]<br>
The bracket 33 of the storage box 29 has an inte¬gral boss 49 projecting downwardly at a position dis-<br><br>
placed off the arm member 39 along the axis of the shaft 38.  The boss 49 has a fastening surface 50 on its lower end, and a vertically extending bottomed attachment hole 51 defined therein which has a lower end open at the fas¬tening surface 50 and an upper end closed.  The stay 46 to which the switch case 44 is fastened has an integral attachment plate 46a facing the fastening surface 50.  A screw 52 extends through the attachment plate 46a and is threaded into the attachment hole 51.  The seat switch 43 is fastened to the bracket 33 of the storage box 29 from below. [0029]<br>
The bracket 33 of the storage box 29 also has an integral positioning projection, 53 projecting downwardly at a position between the hinge pin 35 and the boss 49. The positioning projection 53 has a downwardly facing positioning surface 54 on its lower end held against the upper end of the stay 46 for limiting an upper limit position of the seat switch 43 with respect to the stor¬age box 29.  The positioning surface 54 lies substantial¬ly parallel to the fastening surface 50 and the limiting surface 42. [0030]<br><br>
A detected signal from the seat switch 43 is used to control the engine E.  A process of controlling the engine E will be described below. [0031]<br>
In FIG. 7, a combination starter generator 60 disposed coaxially with a crankshaft 31 comprises a star¬ter motor 61 and an AC generator (ACG) 62.  Electric en¬ergy generated by the ACG 62 is supplied via a regulator rectifier 63 to charge a battery 64.  The regulator rec¬tifier 63 regulates the output voltage of the combination starter generator 60 to 12 V or 14.5 V, for example. When a starter relay 65 is rendered conductive, the bat¬tery 64 supplies a drive current to the starter motor 61 and also supplies load currents via a main switch 66 to various general electric accessories 67, a main control¬ler C, etc. [0032]<br>
To the main controller C, there are connected an Ne sen¬sor (crankshaft pulser) 69 for detecting the rotational speed of the engine E, an idling switch 70 for manually permitting or limiting idling of the engine E, the seat switch 43 for closing contacts to output a high-level signal when the driver is seated on the seat 32, a vehi¬cle speed sensor 71 for detecting a vehicle speed, a<br><br><br>
standby indicator 72 which flickers in a stop/start mode, a throttle sensor 73 for detecting a throttle opening, a starter switch 74 for energizing the starter motor 61 to start the engine E, a stop switch 75 operable, in response to a braking action to output a high-level signal, a bat¬tery indicator 76 which is energized to warn the driver about insufficient battery charging when the voltage of the battery 64 drops below a predetermined value, e.g., 10 V, and a coolant temperature sensor 77 for detecting the temperature of the coolant of the engine E. [0033]<br>
To the main controller C, there are also connect¬ed an ignition control unit (including an ignition coil) 79 for igniting an ignition plug 78 in synchronism with rotation of the crankshaft 31, a control terminal of the starter relay 65 for supplying electric energy to the starter motor 61, a terminal of a front lamp relay 81 for supplying electric energy to a front lamp 80, a control terminal of a by-starter relay 83 for supplying electric energy to a by-starter 82 mounted on the carburetor 25, and an alarm buzzer 84 for generating a alarm sound to warn the driver under certain conditions. [0034]<br><br><br>
preventing the battery from being fully discharged when the engine E is stopped over a long period of time while the front lamp 80 is being energized. ,<br>
[0036]<br>
If the main switch 66 is turned on to reset the main controller C or the idling switch 70 is turned off<br>
(condition 1 satisfied), then the "start mode" is se¬lected.  In the "start mode", if a vehicle speed equal to or higher than a predetermined speed is detected by the vehicle speed sensor 71 is detected for a predetermined period of time or more (condition 2 satisfied), then the "start mode" changes to "stop/start mode".  Immediately after the "start mode" has changed to "stop/start mode", the "first pattern" is activated to inhibit idling of the engine E.<br>
[0037]<br>
In the "first pattern", if it is determined that the engine E has been turned off continuously for 3 minutes or more (condition 3 satisfied)," then the opera¬tion pattern in the "stop/start mode" switches from the "first pattern" to the "second pattern".  If the condi¬tion 2 is satisfied in the "second pattern", then the op¬eration pattern switches from the "second pattern" to the "first pattern".<br><br>
In FIG. 8, the main controller C switches between a mode for limiting idling of the engine and a mode for permitting idling of the engine to control the engine E. In the mode for limiting idling of the engine, when the vehicle is stopped, the engine E is automatically stopped, and when the accelerator is operated while the vehicle is at rest, the engine E is automatically started to enable the vehicle to start moving.  This mode is. referred to as "stop/start mode".  There are available two modes for the mode for permitting idling of the en¬gine.  One of the two modes is a "start mode" for permit¬ting temporary idling of the engine after the engine E has started at first for the purpose of warming the engi¬ne E.  The other mode is an "idling switch mode" for per¬mitting idling of the engine at all times according to the will of the driver (switch setting). [0035]<br>
The stop/start mode can switch between a first operation pattern (hereinafter referred to as "first pat¬tern") for inhibiting idling of the engine entirely and a second operation mode (hereinafter referred to as "second pattern") for permitting idling of the engine exception¬ally under certain conditions.  The second pattern is preferable as a battery discharge prevention mode for<br><br>
[0038]<br>
When the main switch 66 is turned on, if the idling switch 70 is turned on (condition 6 satisfied), then the "idling switch mode" is activated.  In the "stop/start mode", if the idling switch 70 is turned on (condition 4 satisfied) irrespective of whether the op¬eration pattern is the "first pattern" or the "second pattern", the "idling switch mode" is activated. [0039]<br>
If the idling switch 70 is turned off in the "idling switch mode" (condition 5 satisfied), then the "start mode" is activated. [0040]<br>
In the "start mode", the "idling switch mode", the "first pattern" in the "stop/start mode", and the "second pattern" in the "stop/start mode", the turning -on/off of the starter relay 65, the turning-on/off of ti by-starter relay 83, the standby indicator 72, the igni¬tion of the ignition plug 78, the front lamp 80, the alarm buzzer 84, and the charging of the battery 64 are controlled as follows: [0041]<br>
In FIG. 9, the front lamp 80 is energizable at all times except for the "start mode".  Specifically, ir<br><br>
the "start mode", the front lamp 80 is energizable if the engine rotational speed detected by the Ne sensor 69 is equal to or higher than a preset rotational speed (e.g., 1500 rpm) or the vehicle speed detected by the vehicle speed sensor 71 is higher than 0 km/h. [0042]<br>
The operation of the ignition control unit 79 for igniting the ignition plug 78 is permitted in either one of the "start mode", the "second pattern" in the "stop/start mode", and the "idling switch mode".  In the "first pattern" in the "stop/start mode", the ignition control unit 79 is operated to ignite the ignition plug 78 if the vehicle is judged as running or the throttle valve is judged as being open. [0043]<br>
The alarm buzzer 84 produces buzzer sound as an alarm to warn the driver depending on the running condi¬tion of the vehicle and the seating of the driver on the seat 32 in each operation mode and each operation pat¬tern.  Specifically, in the "start mode", the alarm buzzer 84 is turned off at all times.  In the "first pat¬tern" in the "stop/start mode", the alarm buzzer 84 is turned on if the period of time in which the seat switch 43 detects no one seated on the seat 43 with the ignition<br><br><br>
plug 78 turned off continues for 1 second or more, for example, or.if the turning-off of the ignition plug 78 continues for 3 minutes or more, for example.  In the second pattern" in the "stop/start mode", the alarm buzzer 84 is turned on if the ignition plug 78 is turned off, the throttle opening based on an input signal from the throttle sensor 73 is "0", and the vehicle speed based on an input signal from the vehicle speed sensor 71 is 0 km/h.  In the "idling switch mode", the a.larm buzzer 84 is turned on if the ignition plug 78 is turned off and the no one is seated on the seat 43 for 1 second or more, for example. [0044]<br>
For controlling the charging of the battery 64, the voltage to which the battery 64 is charged is reduced from the normal level of 14.5 V to 12.0 V in a first state in which the vehicle speed is higher than "0" km and the period of time in which the throttle valve is fully opened from the fully closed position is 0.3 second or less, i.e., an accelerating action is recognized as being made, based on input signals from the throttle sen¬sor 73 and the vehicle speed sensor 71, or a second state in which the vehicle speed is "0" km and the throttle valve is open when the engine rotational speed is equal<br><br>
to or smaller than a preset rotational speed (e.g., 600 rpm) , i.e., a starting action is recognized as being made, based on input signals from the throttle sensor 73 and the vehicle speed sensor 71.  The control of the charging of the battery 64 is stopped and the voltage to which the battery 64 is charged is returned to 14.5 V if 6 seconds have elapsed from the start of the control of the charging of the battery 64, or the engine rotational speed exceeds a preset rotational speed (e.g., 7000 rpm), or the throttle opening is reduced. [0045]<br>
The starter motor 61 is energized under certain conditions depending on the operation mode and the opera¬tion pattern.  Specifically, in the "start mode" and the "idling switch mode", the starter re'lay 65 is rendered conductive to energize- the starter motor 61 if the engine rotational speed detected by the Ne sensor 69 is equal to or lower than a preset idling speed (e.g:, 800 rpm), and both the starter switch 74 and the stop switch 75 are turned on. [0046]<br>
In the "first pattern" in the "stop/start mode", the starter relay 65 is rendered conductive to energize the starter motor 61 when the throttle valve is opened if<br><br>
the engine rotational speed is equal to or lower than the preset idling speed and the seat switch 43 is turned on. [0047]<br>
In the "second pattern" in the "stop/start mode", the starter relay 65 is rendered conductive to energize the starter motor 61 when at least one of the starting condition in the "start mode" and the "idling switch mode" and the starting condition in the "first pattern" in the "stop/start mode" is satisfied. [0048]<br>
The by-starter relay 83 is controlled to be ren¬dered conductive if the engine rotational speed is equal to or higher than a preset rotational speed in any of the operation modes and the operation patterns.  Therefore, in any of the operation modes, the fuel density is in¬creased if the engine rotational speed is equal to or higher than a preset rotational speed. [0049]<br>
The standby indicator 72 flickers if the seat switch 43 is turned on and the engine rotational speed is equal to or higher than preset rotational speeds in the "first pattern" in the "stop/start mode".  While the ve¬hicle is at rest in the "stop/start mode", the standby indicator 72 flickers, allowing the driver to recognize<br><br>
that the vehicle can be started immediately once the ac¬celerator is operated upon flickering of the standby in¬dicator 72 . [0050]<br>
Operation of the embodiment will be described be¬low.  When the driver is not seated on the seat 32 which is closing the storage box 29, since the seat 32 is urged upwardly under resilient forces of the rubber seal 36, the hinge pin 35 does not exert downward pressing forces to the arm member 39, and the seat switch 43 mounted on the storage box 29 is turned off.  When the driver is seated on the seat 32, the seat 32 is lowered, compress¬ing the rubber seal 36.  Because the hinge pin 35 is low¬ered, depressing the arm member 39, the arm member 39 presses the seat switch 43 to turn on the seat switch 43. [0051]<br>
The bracket 33 has the limiting surface 42 held against the upper surface of the arm member 39 supported for vertical angular movement on the bracket 33 of the storage box 29 by the shaft 38 for limiting the upward movement of the arm 39, and the hinge pin 35 vertically movable in unison with the seat 32 is disposed upwardly of the arm member 39 so as to be able to abut against the upper surface of the arm member 39.  Inasmuch as the arm<br><br><br>
member 39 disposed above the seat switch 43 is mounted on the storage box 29 with its upper limit position limited by the limiting surface 42, and the hinge pin 35 verti¬cally movable in unison with the seat 32 is disposed so as to be able to abut against the upper surface of the arm member 39, it is possible to position the arm member 39 and the seat switch 43 relatively to each other with high accuracy on the storage box 29, and the seat switch 43 can detect highly accurately when the driver is seated on the seat 32. [0052]<br>
The hinge pin 35 performs the function as a transmitting member for transmitting vertical movement of the seat 32 to the arm member 39 as well as the function to support the seat 32 angularly movably on the storage box 29.  Therefore, any parts dedicated to the transmit¬ting member are not required, and the number of parts used is reduced. [0053]<br>
The bracket 33 of the storage box 29 has the downwardly facing positioning surface 54 for limiting the upper limit position of the seat switch 43, and the seat switch 43 can be mounted on the storage box 29 so as to be pressed against the positioning surface 54 from below.<br><br>
The relative position of the seat switch 43 with respect to the storage box 29 can be determined easily with high accuracy. [0054]<br>
Because the seat switch 43 is fastened to the bracket 33 of the storage box 29 from below, the vertica relative position of the seat switch 43 with respect to the arm member 39 can be determined easily with high ac¬curacy.  In particular, the accuracy of the vertical re¬lative position of the seat switch 43 with respect to th arm member 39 can easily be increased by limiting the up per limit position of the seat switch 43 with the posi¬tioning surface 54. [0055]<br>
The fastening surface 50 to which the stay 46 with the seat switch 43 mounted thereon is fastened, the positioning surface 54, and the limiting surface 42 are formed on the bracket 33 so as to face downwardly and li substantially parallel to each other.  Consequently, the seat switch 43 can easily be mounted on the storage box 29. [0056]<br>
When no one is seated on the seat 32 which is re siliently urged upwardly by the rubber seal 36 while<br><br>
closing the storage box 29, the gap 55 is created between the hinge 35 and the arm member 39.  Therefore, the rela¬tive positional accuracy of the arm member 39 with re¬spect to the seat switch 43 is prevented from being low¬ered by forces applied from the seat 32 to the arm member 39 which is mounted on the storage box 29 with the in¬creased relative positional accuracy with respect to the seat switch 43. [0057]<br>
While the embodiment of the present invention has been described in detail, the present invention is not limited the above embodiment, but various design changes may be made therein without departing from the invention as described in the scope of claims for patent. [0058]<br>
According to the invention described in claim 1, as described above, it is possible to position the arm member and the seat switch relatively to each other highly accurately on the storage box,, and the seat switch is capable of highly accurately detecting when the driver is seated on the seat. [0059]<br><br>
According to the invention described in claim 2, no parts dedicated to the transmitting member are re¬quired, and the number of parts used can be reduced.<br>
[0060]<br>
According to the invention described in claim 3, inasmuch as the seat switch is mounted on the storage box so as to be pressed against the positioning surface from below, the relative position of the seat switch with re¬spect to the storage box can be determined easily and highly accurately.<br>
[0061]<br>
According to the invention described in claim 4, it is easy to determine the vertical relative position of the seat switch with respect to the arm member highly ac¬curately.  Particularly, if the upper limit position of the seat switch is limited by the positioning surface, then the accuracy of the vertical relative position of the seat switch with respect to the arm member can easily be increased.<br>
[0062]<br>
According to the invention described in claim 5, the seat switch can easily be mounted on the storage box.<br>
[0063]<br><br><br>
According to the invention described in claim 6, the relative positional accuracy of the arm member with respect to the seat switch is prevented from being low¬ered by forces applied from the seat to the arm member which is mounted on the storage box with the increased relative positional accuracy with respect to the seat switcH.<br><br><br>
