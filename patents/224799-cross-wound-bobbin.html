				<td>CROSS-WOUND BOBBIN<br>
Cross-wound bobbins, also called cheeses or cheese<br>
packages, are supply bobbins from which a yarn is unwound and<br>
delivered to a yarn-using machine, such as a weaving machine or<br>
knitting machine. The cheese cone of the cross-wound bobbin is<br>
self-supporting and does not require end plates on the face<br>
ends. The hold within the cheese cone is achieved because the<br>
yarn or thread is wound up helically at a relatively high pitch<br>
traverse, rather than with windings close together as in a<br>
flanged bobbin with walls on the ends. The pitch traverse of<br>
the helical lines is high in order that the yarn in the<br>
individual layers of yarn will intersect multiple times, thus<br>
stabilizing the layer of yarn beneath it. At the same time, it<br>
forms an enveloping surface for the layer underneath.<br>
The angle of inclination or crossing angle at which the<br>
yarns in the individual layers intersect prevents the yarns<br>
from forcing their way in between individual windings in the<br>
layer underneath, as would happen in a parallel-wound bobbin.<br>
On the face ends of the cheese cone, the yarn makes the<br>
transition from one layer to the next, or from one helical line<br>
to the other, at a turning point. The turning points at the<br>
two face ends constantly change their location within the<br>
cheese cone, in order to stabilize the face ends.<br>
Free access to at least one face end of the cross-wound<br>
bobbin is needed to allow the yarn to be drawn off from the<br>
top, that is, overend. In overend unwinding, the cross-wound<br>
bobbin itself remains stationary. The yarn is unwound from the<br>
top of the stationary cross-wound bobbin through a yarn eye.<br>
The yarn eye is at a distance from the unwinding end of the<br>
cross-wound bobbin and is located on the axis of symmetry of<br>
the cross-wound bobbin.<br>
From German patent disclosure DE 41 42 886, one such<br>
cross- wound bobbin is known in which the pitch traverse<br>
differs in the various layers. That is, the inclination of the<br>
helical line that the yarn in one layer forms differs<br>
quantitatively from the inclination of the helical line in the<br>
yarn layer either above or beneath it.<br>
The differing inclination is intended to solve one<br>
problem in unwinding the cross-wound bobbin. If the angles of<br>
inclination are the same, the yarn can tend to catch at the<br>
crossing points, which impairs the unwinding capability. This<br>
adhesion increases the unwinding force abruptly, to the point<br>
of an overload on the yarn and consequent yarn breakage.<br>
For producing the known cross-wound bobbin, a traversing<br>
device is used, which operates at a variable reciprocation<br>
speed. The cross-wound bobbin produced is wound up in such a<br>
way that the yarn quantity upon unwinding is less if the<br>
unwinding point of the yarn on the outside of the cheese cone<br>
is moving from the unwinding end to the bottom end, compared to<br>
the yarn quantity drawn off if the unwinding point is moving in<br>
the opposite direction.<br>
Modern textile machines and especially weaving machines<br>
have attained a speed that is limited by the delivery speed of<br>
the yarn.<br>
Fig. 1 schematically illustrates the conditions involved<br>
in unwinding a known cross-wound bobbin 1. The cross-wound<br>
bobbin 1 comprises a cheese cone 2, which is wound onto a<br>
tubular bobbin tube 3. A thread or yarn 4 forms the cheese<br>
cone 2. The yarn 4 is wound in layers of windings with the aid<br>
of a known traversing device. Two of these layers are shown<br>
schematically and in part. The yarn is indicated in one layer<br>
by reference numeral 5 and in the other layer by reference<br>
numeral 6. For instance, let layer 5 be the layer or winding<br>
located farther inward, while the layer 6 or winding is located<br>
radially farther outward. In one layer, such as layer 5, the<br>
windings of the yarn 4 form a counterclockwise helix, while in<br>
the windings of yarn in layer 6 form a clockwise helix. The<br>
angles of inclination at which the yarn 5 is wound are<br>
quantitatively relatively large, compared to a plane 7 located<br>
perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the bobbin tube 3.<br>
That is, the height of inclination of the helixes that the<br>
layers 5 and 6 form is multiple times larger than the thickness<br>
of the yarn 4. In this way, the windings of one layer are<br>
prevented from being able to force their way into the other<br>
layer and forcing the windings of that layer apart.<br>
The cross-wound bobbin 1 obtained in this way forms an<br>
unwinding end 8 that is an essentially plane annular face.<br>
Turning points 9, where the yarn course changes from one layer<br>
to the next and thus from one helical line to the helical line<br>
in the opposite direction, are located in the region of the<br>
unwinding end. The turning points 9 in the region of the<br>
unwinding end are distributed as randomly as possible, or more<br>
specifically are randomly distributed in both the<br>
circumferential direction and, with a certain range of<br>
deviation, in the axial direction. These provisions are<br>
intended on the one hand to attain effective stabilization of<br>
the unwinding end and on the other to avert an agglomeration of<br>
material.<br>
The foot end is located on the other axial end of the<br>
cross-wound bobbin 1 and is built up in the same way as the<br>
unwinding end 8 that can be seen in Fig. 1.<br>
From the outer circumferential surface of the cross-<br>
wound bobbin 1, the yarn 4 is drawn off through an eye 11,<br>
which is axially spaced apart from the cross-wound bobbin 1 and<br>
is located on the axis of symmetry. The yarn eye 11 is fixed<br>
in space. The cross-wound bobbin 1 is likewise unmoving while<br>
the yarn is being drawn off.<br>
Because of the adhesion of the yarn to the effective<br>
surface of the bobbin, a defined unwinding point 12 develops,<br>
beyond which the course of the yarn, in the travel direction of<br>
the yarn 4 during unwinding, no longer corresponds to the yarn<br>
course inside the cross-wound bobbin 1. The unwinding point 12<br>
circulates in the circumferential direction along the helical<br>
line that the yarn 4 forms on the outside of the cheese cone 2<br>
at the time, and at the same time the unwinding point 12 moves<br>
in the longitudinal direction of the cross-wound bobbin 1.<br>
The speed at which the unwinding point 12 circulates in<br>
the circumferential direction, or in other words its angular<br>
speed, depends on the yarn unwinding speed and on the diameter<br>
of the cheese cone 2. The greater the diameter of the cheese<br>
cone 2 and the lower the unwinding speed, the lower is the<br>
angular speed at which the unwinding point 12 rotates.<br>
Conversely, the angular speed increases if, at a constant<br>
unwinding speed, the winding diameter has decreased because of<br>
increasing yarn consumption.<br>
Because the unwinding point 12 rotates about the<br>
circumference of the cheese cone 2, the yarn segment between<br>
the yarn eye 11 and the unwinding point 12 rotates about the<br>
imaginary axis that is defined by the yarn eye 11 and the axis<br>
of symmetry of the cheese cone 2. The rotation generates a<br>
centrifugal force that tends to push the drawh-off length of<br>
yarn radially outward.<br>
While the cheese cone is still full, the circulation<br>
speed of the unwinding point 12 of the yarn 4 from the top end<br>
of the cheese cone 2, for a given yarn consumption rate, is<br>
still relatively slight. The incident centrifugal force is<br>
insufficient to unwind the yarn 4, immediately adjacent to the<br>
unwinding point 12, from the top end of the cheese cone 2. On<br>
the far side of the unwinding point 12, the yarn 3 will first<br>
slide over the top end of the cheese cone 2, before reaching<br>
open spec after moving past the unwinding end 8.<br>
In space, the freely floating length of yarn defines a<br>
surface of revolution whose apex is located at the yarn eye 11.<br>
The generatrix of this surface of revolution is the freely<br>
floating length of yarn itself, which describes a complicated<br>
three-dimensional curve. This freely floating length of yarn<br>
is engaged not only by centrifugal force but also by air<br>
resistance, so the yarn course is not a simple line located in<br>
one plane. The volume defined by the freely floating length of<br>
yarn is known as a yarn balloon.<br>
As consumption increases, the outer diameter of the<br>
cheese cone 2 decreases. Since the yarn unwinding speed<br>
remains constant, the unwinding point 12 must circulate faster,<br>
to compensate for the reduction in yarn length along the<br>
circumference that is due to the reduction in diameter.<br>
Beyond a certain angular speed, the centrifugal force<br>
will be high enough to lift the yarn 4 from the top end of the<br>
cheese cone 2 immediately adjacent to the unwinding point 12.<br>
The adhesion of the yarn 4 to the layers of yarn beneath<br>
it, irregularities in the air resistance of the yarn caused by<br>
structural changes, fluctuations in yarn tension, and still<br>
other such factors, mean that in a range of angular speed of<br>
the unwinding point 12, the unwinding conditions will<br>
constantly alternate between sliding on the surface of the<br>
cheese cone 2 and floating above the surface. The inventors<br>
have determined that this alternation back and forth between<br>
the two unwinding situations is also influenced by whether the<br>
unwinding point 12 is moving away from the unwinding end 8, or<br>
toward the unwinding end 8.<br>
If the unwinding point 12 is moving away from the<br>
unwinding end 8, the circulation speed and thus also the<br>
centrifugal force increase, resulting in a tendency for the<br>
yarn 4 immediately adjacent to the unwinding point 12 to come<br>
loose from the top end of the cheese cone 2 and float freely<br>
above the surface. Conversely, if the unwinding point 12 is<br>
moving toward the unwinding end 8, the circulation speed and<br>
the centrifugal force decrease, so that the yarn 4 instead has<br>
the tendency to slip over the top end.<br>
The effects of air resistance on the top end of the<br>
cheese cone 2 will also have a corresponding influence in this<br>
respect.<br>
Not until the angular speed of the unwinding point has<br>
increased still further will a changeover to the unwinding<br>
situation in which the yarn slides above the surface no longer<br>
occur.<br>
The progressive yarn consumption causes the diameter of<br>
the cheese cone 2 to shrink increasingly and causes the angular<br>
speed of the unwinding point 12 to increase further. The<br>
greater speed of the yarn in the air causes the single balloon<br>
that initially forms to become a so-called double balloon, with<br>
two clearly recognizable balloon portions joined to one another<br>
by a narrow constriction. The course of the floating length of<br>
yarn in this situation is shown in Fig. 2.<br>
The transition from the situation shown in Fig. 1 to the<br>
situation shown in Fig. 2 likewise takes place in a range in<br>
which there is constant alternation between the conformation of<br>
Fig. 1 and the conformation of Fig. 2. Not until beyond a<br>
certain angular speed will the conformation of Fig. 2 develop<br>
exclusively.<br>
At a very low package diameter, finally, a triple yarn<br>
balloon is created, with two recognizable constrictions. The<br>
yarn course associated with this triple balloon is shown in<br>
Fig. 3. The transition from the conformation of Fig. 2 to the<br>
conformation of Fig. 3 also extends over an angular speed range<br>
in which the balloon alternates constantly between being double<br>
and triple. Different forces and yarn tensions that occur in<br>
the yarn are certainly associated with the various types of<br>
balloon.<br>
The strength of a yarn has a bell-curve distribution<br>
around a mean tensile strength value. Because of the deviation<br>
in the strength values, there are some segments in the yarn<br>
that have a markedly higher breaking strength and conversely<br>
other segments that already break at markedly lesser forces.<br>
In turn, the yarn-using apparatus certainly does not<br>
generate a single constant force; on the contrary, its force<br>
will also be distributed in a bell curve. Yarn breaks are to<br>
be expected in the range in which the gaussian curve of the<br>
force that actually occurs overlaps the strength distribution<br>
of the yarn, or in other words, the range in which the two<br>
gaussian curves overlap. The larger the area of overlap, the<br>
greater the likelihood that the yarn will break on the yarn-<br>
using side, which accordingly leads to machine down times.<br>
One quite critical place that the yarn must travel<br>
through from the cross-wound bobbin to the finished textile<br>
article is the unwinding from the lp 1 itself.<br>
Fig. 4 shows the course of yarn tension, plotted over<br>
the package diameter of the cross-wound bobbin 1. The unit of<br>
measurement for the package diameter is millimeters, and the<br>
unit of measurement for the tensile force is cN (grams). A<br>
severely zigzagging upper curve 13 represents the course of the<br>
maximum incident force, in each case per 100 measured values.<br>
Below it is a dark-colored tubular or bandlike range 13, which<br>
represents the statistical standard deviation in the measured<br>
tensile force values. The statistical mean value of the<br>
incident tensile force is located approximately in the middle<br>
of this band. The graph is divided longitudinally into zones,<br>
numbered from 1 to 6.<br>
The unwinding of the yarn 4 from the cross-wound bobbin<br>
1 begins at the maximum diameter of the cross-wound bobbin if<br>
approximately 280 mm. At this diameter, the angular speed of<br>
the unwinding point 12 is too low for the centrifugal force to<br>
cause the yarn to come loose from the top end of the cross-<br>
wound bobbin 1 directly at the unwinding point 12. In this<br>
operating situation, the yarn 4 slides over the surface and<br>
generates comparatively quite high maximum tensile stresses,<br>
even though the mean value is relatively low, and the standard<br>
deviation is not excessively high either, as the band 14 shows.<br>
The high maximum tensile stresses are due above all to the<br>
fact that the yarn 4 that is sliding on the surface catches on<br>
the yarn over which it is sliding, since the yarn surface<br>
itself is not smooth. Individual fibers protrude from it.<br>
The operating situation in which the yarn slides<br>
persists in its pure form until a package diameter of<br>
approximately 260 mm.<br>
Below about 260 mm, that is, at the transition between<br>
the zones marked 1 and 2 in the graph, the unwinding situation<br>
in which the yarn 4 comes loose from the top end immediately<br>
adjacent to the unwinding point 12 will sporadically occur. In<br>
the ranges in which the balloon has already formed from the<br>
unwinding point 12 on, the maximum unwinding force drops<br>
abruptly, and then immediately rises again once the balloon<br>
forms, which is only adjacent to the unwinding end 7. In zone<br>
2, very great fluctuations in the maximum unwinding force and<br>
also relatively great fluctuations in the range of the standard<br>
deviation can therefore be observed.<br>
As the diameter reduction progresses further, or in<br>
other words to the right of zone 2, the balloon adjacent to the<br>
unwinding point 12 remains stable. Unwinding with sliding no<br>
longer occurs. The maximum incident tensile force decreases<br>
abruptly. The standard deviation becomes less, and the mean<br>
value also drops. Clearly, to the right of zone 2, the yarn 4<br>
being unwound is mechanically much less heavily loaded. The<br>
likelihood of yarn breakage is reduced significantly.<br>
Down to a diameter of about 160 mm, that is, within zone<br>
3, conditions remain stable, and the yarn tension rises only<br>
slowly. The increase in yarn tension can be ascribed to the<br>
higher rotational speed and the attendant greater load from air<br>
resistance and the greater mass of yarn located in the balloon.<br>
To the right of zone 3, a pronounced increase in the<br>
maximum tensile tress and also in the mean value can be<br>
observed. The balloon now assumes even greater dimensions,<br>
which lead to higher tensile stresses because of higher<br>
centrifugal force. A randomly distributed alternation between<br>
the single balloon and the double balloon also occurs. Toward<br>
the end of zone 4, finally, the situation finally switches over<br>
in favor of the double balloon, whereupon the centrifugal<br>
forces abruptly drop, and hence so do the tensile stresses.<br>
Both the standard deviation and the maximum, stresses that<br>
occur, that is, the exceptional stresses in the direction of<br>
very high values, also decrease abruptly. At the end of zone<br>
5, at a diameter of less than 60 mm, finally, a change to a<br>
triple balloon can be observed. At the end of zone 5, the<br>
maximum force again rises relatively sharply, and then abruptly<br>
collapses, once the triple balloon has developed to a steady<br>
state.<br>
With the above as the point of departure, it is the<br>
object of the invention to create a cross-wound bobbin that is<br>
suitable for quantitatively reducing the maximum tensile<br>
stresses that occur in the yarn and/or limiting them to a<br>
reduced operating range, in order to lessen the likelihood of<br>
yarn breakage.<br>
This object is attained according to the invention by<br>
the cross-wound bobbin as defined by the characteristics of<br>
claim 1.<br>
In the cross-wound bobbin of the invention, the<br>
individual layers are wound with a different inclination of the<br>
helical lines. They are wound in such a way that the yarn<br>
length drawing off is greater if the unwinding point is moving<br>
from the unwinding end to the bottom end, compared to the yarn<br>
length that is drawn off if the unwinding point is moving from<br>
the bottom end to the unwinding end. In other words, the helix<br>
along which the unwinding point moves from the top end to the<br>
bottom end has a markedly lesser inclination than the helical<br>
line along which the unwinding point moves from the bottom end<br>
toward the top end. Because of this provision, the unfavorable<br>
influence on the balloon that is due to the fact that the<br>
unwinding point moves away from the yarn balloon at relatively<br>
high speed, can be reduced. Because of the lesser inclination<br>
of the helical line as the unwinding point moves away from the<br>
balloon, the axial speed of the unwinding point away from the<br>
balloon is reduced markedly, and the unfavorable influence on<br>
the balloon formation is lessened.<br>
At smaller diameters, the cross-wound bobbin of the<br>
invention shows the transition to the double balloon more<br>
clearly, which as explained above is more favorable in terms of<br>
the maximum incident stress. Once again, the diameter range<br>
over which switching back and forth between the single and the<br>
double balloon occurs is reduced markedly. Smaller ranges<br>
correspondingly lessen the likelihood of yarn breakage.<br>
If sliding unwinding occurs, the constant fluctuation<br>
between sliding yarn unwinding and freely floating yarn<br>
unwinding in the cross-wound bobbin of the invention is reduced<br>
to a very much smaller diameter range.<br>
Compared with the prior art, a steady floating balloon<br>
that begins at the unwinding point will already develop at very<br>
much greater outer diameters of the cheese cone.<br>
In both cases, the invention makes a higher unwinding<br>
speed possible.<br>
By a suitable free choice of the pitch traverses of the<br>
helical lines within the cheese cone, it is possible within<br>
certain limits to control when the switchover to the<br>
respectively other type of unwinding or conformation of the<br>
balloon occurs, or in other words when the change from the<br>
sliding unwinding to the free-floating unwinding after the<br>
unwinding point irreversibly occurs, or when the double balloon<br>
or the triple balloon irreversibly occurs.<br>
Further features of the invention are also the subject<br>
of dependent claims.<br>
In Fig. 5, the cross-wound bobbin 1 of the invention is<br>
shown highly schematically.<br>
The cross-wound bobbin 1 of the invention has the same<br>
basic makeup as the cross-wound bobbin 1 of the prior art. It<br>
has a bobbin tube 3 on which the cheese cone 2 is applied. The<br>
course of the yarn on the top end of the cheese cone 2 is shown<br>
schematically. In unwinding, the indicated takeoff point 12<br>
moves in the upper visible yarn layer in the direction of an<br>
arrow 15 from the bottom end 16 to the unwinding end or top end<br>
8. The layer forms a clockwise helix. As soon as the upper<br>
visible layer has been removed, the unwinding point 12 changes<br>
to the layer beneath it, where the unwinding point 12' (with a<br>
prime, because it is located in the next layer) moves in the<br>
direction of the arrow 17. This layer contains the yarn 4 in a<br>
counterclockwise helix.<br>
As Fig. 5 clearly shows, the unwinding point 12'<br>
completes 2.5 revolutions when it moves from the top end or<br>
unwinding end 8 to the bottom end 16, but only about one<br>
revolution in moving from the bottom end 16 to the unwinding<br>
end 8. The winding ratio, in the instance shown, would be 1 to<br>
2.5. In a departure from the winding ratio shown, still other<br>
winding ratios up to 1:10 and preferably 1:5 are conceivable,<br>
and depending on the yarn conditions they result in improved<br>
values for the unwinding force, compared with cross-wound<br>
bobbin in which the winding ratio in the successive layers is<br>
1:1. The term "winding ratio" is understood here to mean the<br>
number of windings in which the yarn is wound on along the way<br>
from the bottom end to the unwinding end, in proportion to the<br>
number of windings that the yarn describes on the trip in<br>
reverse.<br>
In other words, the amount of the angle a that the yarn<br>
4 in the layer with the clockwise helix forms with the plane 7<br>
is greater than the amount of the angle (3 that the yarn 4 in<br>
the layer with the counterclockwise helix forms with the yarn<br>
7.<br>
Aside from the difference noted, the cross-wound bobbin<br>
1 of Fig. 5 is produced on the same criteria as usual.<br>
Agglomerations of material are to be avoided, and to do so, the<br>
turning point 9 both at the unwinding end 8 and at the bottom<br>
end 16 is shifted. As random an orientation of the yarn course<br>
as possible, relative to the next layer having the same winding<br>
direction, is also sought, in order to avoid moire effects or<br>
regularities that cause problems.<br>
Besides the conical shape as shown in Fig. 5, the cross-<br>
wound bobbin 1 can also be shaped, by means of suitable<br>
winding, in such a way that its cone angle varies as a function<br>
of diameter, or that for instance toward the end, i.e. at small<br>
diameters, it changes to a cylindrical shape. It would also be<br>
conceivable to create a cross-wound bobbin 1 in which the<br>
cheese cone 2, adjacent to the unwinding end 8, is initially<br>
cylindrical and then changes to a region where it is<br>
frustoconical. A hyperboloid is thus approximated.<br>
The cheese cone can also be cylindrical over the full<br>
length and through all diameters, as is conventional today.<br>
Findings from a series of experiments demonstrate that<br>
the improvement can be shown in table form as follows for the<br>
diameter of 100 mm:<br>
Pitch ratio<br>
1:1 1:2 1:2.5 1:3<br>
Prior art<br>
Maximum force 25 cN 18 cN 11 cN 17 cN<br>
Standard deviation ±5 cN ±4 cN ±3 cN ±4 cN<br>
Mean value 6 cN 5 cN 3 cN 5 cN<br>
For a package diameter of approximately 65 mm, the<br>
following relationships pertain:<br>
Pitch ratio<br>
1:1 1:2 1:2.5 1:3<br>
Prior art<br>
Maximum force 35 cN 18 cN 15 cN 12 cN<br>
Standard deviation ±6 cN ±4 cN ±3 cN ±3 cN<br>
Mean value 7 cN 4 cN 4 cN 2 cN<br>
The angles of inclination a and (3 can be constant, with<br>
the exception of the peripheral regions at the unwinding end 8<br>
and the bottom end/6. However, they can also vary over the<br>
axial length, and they can furthermore be dependent on the<br>
radial spacing. Finally, it is conceivable to create a conical<br>
angle that increases up to the point where the bobbin is full,<br>
by providing windings in the interior of the cheese cone,<br>
relative to the radial width, that do not have the full axial<br>
length; that is, windings are generated that beginning for<br>
instance at the bottom end 16 reach only approximately halfway<br>
up the cheese cone 2.<br>
The particular shape and angular ratio selected must be<br>
ascertained individually by experimentation, because in the<br>
process of unwinding the yarn, the type of yarn and the yarn<br>
material as well as the yarn diameter all have a very<br>
substantial role. Optimization by means of a series of<br>
experiments is therefore unavoidable.<br>
In a cross-wound bobbin, the helical lines in which the<br>
yarn is wound up have a different inclination in adjacent<br>
layers. The winding radios are selected such that the quantity<br>
drawn off is greater if the unwinding point is moving from the<br>
unwinding end to the bottom end, compared to the quantity drawn<br>
off if the unwinding point is moving from the bottom end to the<br>
unwinding end.<br>
