DESCRIPTION PREPARATION METHOD OF CATALYST FOR PRODUCING METHACRYLIC ACID<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a method for preparing catalyst for producing methacrylic acid by subjecting methacrolein, isobutyl aldehyde or isobutyric acid to gas phase catalytic oxidation, having a long -life, a high activity as well as high selectivity. BACKGROUND ART<br>
A large number of catalysts for producing methacrylic acid through a gas phase catalytic oxidation methacrolein, isobutylaldehyde or isobutyric acid, have been proposed. Most of the catalysts thereof are mainly composed of molybdenum and phosphorus, and have structures of heteropolyacids and/or salts thereof. The catalysts used in the reaction, however, have low reaction activities, low selectivity for the desired substance, and short lifetime, as compared to molybdenum-vanadium based catalysts proposed for producing acrylic acid through a gas phase catalytic oxidation of acrolein, which are known as reactions similar to a gas phase catalytic oxidation of methacrolein, isobutylaldehyde or isobutyric acid. Accordingly, the improvement of catalyticperformanceof the catalysts is required although some of the catalysts are industrially utilized.<br>
The present inventors first tried the improvement of low activities, low selectivity and short lifetime of conventional gas phase catalytic oxidation catalysts for methacrolein, and<br><br>
found out that gas phase catalytic oxidation catalysts for methacrolein prepared by the addition of a variety of elements to Mo, V and P, have heteropolyacid (salt) structures and have high activities, high selectivity and are particularly stable in the lifetime. The inventors propose the catalysts described in Japanese Patent Publication No. 58-11416, Japanese Patent Publication No. 59-24140, Japanese Patent Publication No. 62-14535 and Japanese Patent Publication No. 62-30177.<br>
Recently, because of high concentrations of raw material gases and of environments under which oxidation reactions are conducted at elevated temperature, catalysts that exhibit further high activities, high selectivity and long lifetime, are needed. Various preparation methods are proposed to provide catalysts that satisfy these demands. For example, Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 5-31368 and Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 8-196908 propose methods for preparing molding catalysts that involve using NH4 in addition to the components of Mo, V and P, and utilizing aqueous ammonia as the ammonium source. In addition, Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 11-226411 describes a method for preparing a molding catalyst that comprises using purified starch when an active component of the catalyst is granulated, and improving the pore volume of the catalyst by burning the starch in the calcining step.<br>
Furthermore, when a catalyst is loaded in a fixed-bed reactor as an industrial catalyst, the catalyst is required to be molded to a constant size in order to reduce the pressure drop of the reaction gas prior to and subsequent to the catalyst<br><br>
layer. For this purpose, knownmethods involve normallymolding a catalyst powder to a cylindrical material, a pellet, a ring-shaped material, a sphere-shaped material, or the like, and impregnating or coating an inert carrier with an active catalyst material also.<br>
Advantages of a coated catalyst having the inert carrier as the core include (i) being capable of improving the effective utilization factor of active components of the catalyst, (ii) being expected to improve the selectivity due to the homogeneous distribution of the residence time of reaction materials within the catalyst, and (iii) facilitating the removal of the reaction heat on account of the improvement of the catalyst thermal conductivity or the dilution effect of the inert carrier. As a result, there are many examples applied to selective oxidation of a large heat release.<br>
On the other hand, technical disadvantages in preparing a coated catalyst include (i) the peeling of the coating layer and the difficulty of obtaining a mechanically strong catalyst because the catalyst is subject to cracking, (ii) the difficulty of coating a carrier with a large amount of active catalytic material, and (iii) the difficulty of obtaining a highly active catalyst due to inclusion of inert materials.<br>
Methods for overcoming the disadvantages are related to the properties of active catalyst substances and the present situation is to study catalysts individually because of no general techniques.<br>
A<br><br>

BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
A preparation method according to the invention includes steps of drying and calcining an aqueous solution containing compounds including active ingredients of a catalyst or a water dispersion thereof (hereinafter referred to, both included, as a slurry), followed by blending an obtained calcined body with water, further followed by filtering, and drying a filtration residue.<br>
A first preferable embodiment in a preparation method according to the invention includes dissolving and/or dispersing<br><br>
a plurality of compounds each containing one or a plurality of Mo, V, P, Cu, Cs and NH4, and if necessary, elements other than the above (hereinafter, in some cases, these compounds containing these active components are referred to as "active component-containing compound") into water to prepare a slurry (step (a)), drying (step (b) ) andcalcining (step (c) ) the slurry, blending an obtained calcined body with water and filtering the same (step (d) ) , drying a filtration residue (step (e) ) , andusing the same as a catalyst active component.<br>
In the invention, an active component-containing compound used for preparing a slurry is preferably a compound that forms a heteropoly acid or a salt thereof owing to a drying (step (b) ) or calcining (step (c)). As these compounds, chlorides, sulfates, nitrates, oxides, or acetates of the active component elements can be included. More specific examples of preferable compounds include nitrates such as potassium nitrate and cobalt nitrate; oxides such as molybdenum oxide, vanadium pentoxide, antimony trioxide, cerium oxide, zinc oxide or germanium oxide; and acids such as orthoposphoric acid, phosphoric acid, boric acid, aluminum phosphate or 12-tungstphosphoric acid (or salt thereof).  Furthermore, when, as the copper compound, copper acetate (cuprous acetate, cupric acetate, basic copper acetate or cupric oxide, preferably cupric acetate) or cupper oxide (cuprous oxide, cupric oxide) is used, in some cases, a favorable effect can be obtained. Still furthermore, as the cesium compound, cesium acetate or cesium hydroxide and cesium weak-acid salt, and, as the ammonium compound, both of ammonium acetate<br><br>
and ammonium hydroxide are preferably used. The compounds including the active components can be used singularly or in combinations of two or more kinds thereof. As the cesium weak acid salt, as far as it is a salt of cesium and a generally known weak acid, there is no particular restriction on. For instance, cesium hydrogen carbonate, cesium carbonate, and cesium acetate can be included, and among them, cesium acetate is preferable. Among them, as to cesium acetate, commercially available one can be used as it is; however, by adding acetic acid more than an equivalent weight to an aqueous solution of water-soluble salts such as cesium hydroxide and cesium carbonate, it can be added as an aqueous solution of cesium acetate. Alternatively, an aqueous solution of cesium hydroxide can be added as it is.<br>
In the invention, as the active components other than Mo, V, P, Cu, Cs and NH4, one or more kinds selected from the group consisting of As, Sb, Ag, Mg, Zn, Al, B, Ge, Sn, Pb, Ti, Zr, Cr, Re, Bi, W, Fe, Co, Ni, Ce, Th, K and Rb can be included. Among thm, the elements other than As are preferable.<br>
In the invention, ratios of active component-containing compounds used are, in atomic ratios thereof with respect to 10 of molybdenum, normally 0.1 or more and 6 or less for vanadium, preferably 0.3 or more and 2.0 or less; normally 0.5 or more and 6 or less for phosphorus, preferably 0.7 or more and 2.0 or less; normally more than 0 and 3 or less for copper, preferably 0.01 or more and 1 or less; normally 0.01 or more and 4.0 or less for cesium, preferably 0.1 or more and 2.0 or less; and normally 0.1 or more and 4 . 0 or less for ammonium, preferably<br><br>
0.5 or more and 3.0 or less. The kinds and the ratios of other active components that are used as needed are appropriately determined so that in conformity with conditions used a catalyst that shows the optimum performance may be obtained.<br>
The preparation method according to the invention is performed according to a process mentioned below.<br>
Firstly, a slurry of active component-containing compounds is prepared (step (a) ) . The slurry can be obtained by uniformly blending the respective active component-containing compounds and water.  The slurry preferably contains all of the active component-containing compounds in their necessary amounts as a catalyst. There is no particular restriction on an order of addition of the compounds containing active components when the slurry is prepared. However, it is preferable to firstly put compounds containing Mo, V, P and other metal elements, if necessary, into a slurry, followed by adding a cesium-containing compound, an ammonium-containing compound and a copper-containing compound in the slurry.<br>
There is no particular restriction on a temperature when the slurry is prepared as far as it is in the range that does not disturb the preparation. However, when a temperature when the cesium-containing compound, the ammonium-containing compound and the copper-containing compound are added is normally in the range of 0 to 35°C and preferably in the range of 10 to 30°C, in some cases, an obtained catalyst may have higher activity. \s  this tendency becomes more obvious when copper acetate is<br><br>
used as the copper compound, a method for preparing a slurry becomes more efficient when the preferable adding method is adopted.<br>
In the invention, it is preferable that the slurry is an aqueous solution.  There is no particular restriction on an amount of water used in the slurry insofar as it is an amount that can completely dissolve a total amount of compounds used or can uniformly mix them. However, it is appropriately determined in consideration of a drying method and a drying condition mentioned below. Usually, an amount of water used is substantially 200 to 2000 parts by mass relative to 100 parts by mass of a total mass of the compounds for slurry preparation. An amount of water may be more than necessary, however, when it is excessive, disadvantages such as that energy cost during the drying step becomes higher and in some cases incomplete drying may be caused are generated. That is, since advantage is less in comparison with disadvantage, an appropriate amount is preferable.<br>
Next, the slurry obtained in the above is dried, and thereby a dried slurry is obtained (step (b)). There is no particular restriction on a drying method insofar as the slurry is completely dried. Examples of the drying method include a drum drying, a freeze dry, a spray drying and evaporation to dryness. Among these methods, in the invention, it is preferable to use the spray drying that can dry from a slurry state to powder or granulated powder in short time, or the evaporation to dryness that can directly dry the slurry and is simple, the evaporation<br><br>
to dryness being particularly preferable.<br>
A drying temperature of the spray drying differs depending on a concentration of the slurry and the speed of supplying the slurry. However, generally, the temperature at the exit of the drying machine is within the range of 70 to 150°C. Furthermore, it is preferable to dry so that an average particle diameter of an obtained dried slurry may be in the range of 30 to 700 |im.  In the case of the evaporation to dryness, in particularly, the dried slurry can be obtained in the shape of a lump or a large particle. Accordingly, it is preferable to pulverize appropriately, preferably so as to be 700 urn or less to use. Thus, according to the invention, pulverized one is also contained in the dried slurry.<br>
Then, the dried slurry obtained in this way is calcined preferably in an air atmosphere and thereby a calcined body is obtained (step (c)) . In this case it is ordinary calcined at a temperature in the range of 100 to 420°C, and preferably in the range of 250 to 400°C. The preferable calcining time is 1 to 20 hr .  Such calcined body is preferably obtained as powder .<br>
Next the calcined body is blended with appropriate amount of water, preferably 2 to 5 times by mass as the calcined body, and thereby water-soluble components are eluted. The water-soluble components are assumed to be compounds having the heteropoly acid structure. Since the heteropoly acid salts aimed in the invention exists without dissolving into water, it is separated by filtering (step (d)), and dried (step (e) ) . Thus obtained dried body is preferably powder, and can be used<br><br>
as it is as a catalyst for the gas phase catalytic oxidation.<br>
Next, a second preferable embodiment according to the invention will be explained.<br>
The second preferable embodiment according to the invention includes blending a plurality of compounds each containing one or a plurality of Mo, V, P, Cs and NH4, and if necessary, elements other than the above, provided that Cu is excluded, with water to prepare a slurry (step (a)), drying the same, blending an obtained dried slurry with a Cu-containing compound in the presence of a solvent if necessary, drying it if necessary to obtain a dried body (step (b')), followed by calcining (step (c)), blending an obtained calcined body with water and filtering the same (step (d)), drying a filtration residue (step (e) ) , and using it as a catalyst active component. Thus obtained dried body can be used as it is as a catalyst for the gas phase catalytic oxidation.<br>
In the second embodiment according to the invention, a step of obtaining a catalyst active component, except that a copper-containing compound is blended separately from a dried slurry of other active components-containing compounds, can be carried out similarly as the first embodiment in kinds of the active component-containing compounds and ratios used and other conditions. The dried slurry and the Cu-containing compound can be blended in powder, alternatively the Cu-containing compound may be blended with a solvent, preferably with water to form a slurry. In this case, an amount of water used may be comparable as that used in the first embodiment. A mixture<br><br>
of the dried slurry and the Cu-containing compound, in the case of water being used during preparation, is appropriately dried to obtain a dried body. Then, the dried body is calcined similarly to the first embodiment, followed by blending with water and drying a filtration residue, and thereby a target catalyst can be obtained.  In the second embodiment, the later-added copper compound, after the step of drying (and calcining), does not exist as a free compound.<br>
In the next place, a third preferable embodiment according to the invention will be explained.<br>
Thus obtained dried water-insoluble body, that is, the catalyst active component, in order to make a pressure loss of a reaction gas smaller, is preferably used after forming into a cylindrical matter, a pellet, a ring, or a sphere . Among them, as an improvement in the selectivity and the elimination of reaction heat can be expected, it is most preferable to coat an inactive carrier with an dried water-insoluble body to form a molded body coated with the catalyst.<br>
In the coating step (step (f)), a rolling granulation method described later can be preferably applied. According to the method, in apparatus having a flat or irregular disc at, for instance, a bottom portion of a fixed vessel, the disc is rotated at a high-speed, and thereby carriers in the vessel are violently agitated by repeating autorotation and revolution. When a binder and the dried water-insoluble body as well as, if necessary, other additives such as a mixture of a molding aid and a strength improver are added in the vessel in rotation,<br><br>
the mixture is coated on the carriers. As a method of adding a binder, (i) a method of blending the binder with the mixture beforehand, (ii) a method of adding the binder into the fixed vessel simultaneously with the mixture, (iii) a method of adding the binder after the mixture is added into the fixed vessel, (iv) a method of adding the binder before the mixture is added into the fixed vessel, and (v) a method of dividing the mixture and the binder separately and by appropriately combining the methods (ii) to (iv) to add a total amount can be arbitrarily adopted. Among these, in the case of method (v) , it is preferable to control an addition speed by use of an auto feeder and so on so that a predetermined amount may be carried on carriers without, for instance, sticking of the mixture to a wall of the fixed vessel and coagulation between the mixtures.<br>
There is no particular restriction on the binder insofar as it is at least one kind selected from the group consisting of water and organic compounds having a boiling point of 150°C or less at one atmosphere. However, when the drying after the coating is taken into consideration, ones having a boiling point of 10 0°C or less are preferable . Specific examples of the binders other than water include alcohols such as methanol, ethanol, propanols, andbutanols, preferably alcohols having 1 to 4 carbon atoms; ethers such as ethyl ether, butyl ether or dioxane; esters such as ethyl acetate or butyl acetate; ketones such as acetone or methyl ethyl ketone; and aqueous solutions thereof. Among them, ethanol is particularly pref erable . In the case of ethanol being used as a binder, ethanol/water is in the range of 10/0<br><br>
to 1/9 (by mass ratio) and preferably in the range of 10/0 to 7/3 (by mass ratio). When a mixture of ethanol and water is used, the limit of inflammability thereof should be considered depending on the drying conditions. In such a case, ethanol concentration is preferably in the range of 15 to 40% by mass. An amount of these binder used is normally in the range of 2 to 60 parts by mass relative to 100 parts by mass of the dried water-insoluble body, and preferably in the range of 5 to 25 parts by mass.<br>
Specific examples of the carrier used in the invention include spherical carriers made of silicon carbide, alumina, silica alumina, mullite and alundum and having a diameter in the range of 1 to 15 mm, and preferably in the range of 2.5 to 10 mm. As the carrier, in ordinary cases, one having a pore content of 10 to 70% is used. A ratio of the carrier to the dried water-insoluble body used for coating is normally in the range of 10 to 75% by mass in terms of dried water-insoluble body /(dried water-insoluble body + carrier), and preferably in the range of 15 to 60% by mass.<br>
In the case where a ratio of the dried water-insoluble body used for coating is large, the reactivity of the coated catalyst becomes larger on the one hand, on the other hand, the mechanical strength tends to become smaller (wearing ratio tends to become larger) . On the contrary, when the ratio of the dried water-insoluble body being coated is small, the mechanical strength becomes larger (wearing ratio becomes smaller) on the one hand, on the other hand, the reactivity tends to become<br>
IT-     I   D<br><br>
smaller.<br>
In the invention, in the case of the carrier being coated with the dried water-insoluble body, as needed, a molding aid such as silica gel, diatom earth and alumina powder can be added to the dried water-insoluble body. An amount of the molding aid added is ordinarily 5 to 60 parts by mass relative to 100 parts by mass of the dried water-insoluble body.<br>
Furthermore, it is useful in improving the mechanical strength of the catalyst to add to the catalyst component inorganic fiber such as ceramics fiber and whisker inactive to the catalyst component as the strength improver. However, such fibers as potassium titanate whisker and basic magnesium carbonate whisker that can react with the catalyst component are not suitable. An amount of these fibers added is ordinarily in the range of 1 to 30 parts by mass relative to 100 parts by mass of the dried water-insoluble body.<br>
The additive agents such as the molding aid and the strength improver are added, ordinary during the coating step, in the granulator along with the carrier, the dried water-insoluble body and the binder and used for coating the carrier.<br>
In this way, the carrier is coated with the dried water-insoluble body, and a diameter of the coated material obtained by this process is ordinarily in the range of about 3 to 15 mm.<br>
The coated catalyst obtained in this way can be used in the gas phase catalytic oxidation as a catalyst without modification. However, it is preferably calcined (step (g))<br><br>
because in some cases the catalytic activity is improved by calcining. In this case, a calcining temperature is ordinarily in the range of 100 to 450°C, and preferably 250 to 420°C. A calcining time is preferably in the range of 1 to 20 hr.<br>
In addition, the calcining is ordinarily carried out under an air atmosphere. However, it may be carried out under an inactive gas atmosphere such as nitrogen, and after the calcining under the inactive gas atmosphere, calcining under an air atmosphere can be further applied as circumstances demand. Furthermore, it is preferable to calcine under the inactive gas atmosphere, more preferably in the presence of a reducing agent, as more active catalyst can be obtained in some cases. There is no particular restriction on the reducing agent insofar as it preferably becomes a gas at a calcining temperature. Examples of the reducing agent include CO, alcohols, aldehydes, ketones and organic acids having 2 to 5 carbon atoms, and ethanol is particularly preferable.<br>
The catalyst obtained in the way as mentioned above (hereinafter referred to as catalyst according to the invention) is used for preparing methacrylic acid through the gas phase catalytic oxidation of methacrolein, isobutyl aldehyde or isobutyric acid. When the phrase "the catalyst according to the invention" is used without specific notice, it is used to denote both of the dried water-insoluble body obtained through the steps (a) to (e) and the coated catalyst obtained further through the step (f) (preferably, also step (g)).<br>
The gas phase catalytic oxidation that uses methacrolein,<br><br>
which is amost suitable rawmaterial to use the catalyst according to the invention, will be explained below.<br>
In the gas phase catalytic oxidation, molecular oxygen ormolecular oxygen-containing gas is used. Aratio of molecular oxygen used to methacrolein is in the range of 0.5 to 20 by mole ratio relative, and particularly preferably in the range of 1 to 10. To make the reaction process proceed smoothly, it is preferable to add water to a raw material gas in the range of 1 to 20 by mole ratio relative to methacrolein.<br>
The raw material gas may contain, other than oxygen and as needed water (inordinary casesitis contained as water vapor) , gases inert to the reaction such as nitrogen, carbon dioxide gas, and saturated hydrocarbons.<br>
Furthermore, as for methacrolein, gases obtained by oxidizing isobutylene, tert-buthanol and methyl-tert-butyl ether can be supplied without modification.<br>
A reaction temperature during the gas phase catalytic oxidation is ordinarily in the range of 200 to 400°C, and preferably in the range of 260 to 360°C. A supply amount of the raw material gas is, in terms of spatial velocity (SV), ordinarily in the range of 100 to 6000 hr-1 and preferably in the range of 400 to 3000 hr"1.<br>
In the case of the catalyst according to the invention being used, there is no great change in a reaction result even when the SV is increased. Accordingly, it is possible to perform the reaction at a high spatial velocity.<br>
Furthermore, though it is possible to perform the gas phase<br><br>
catalytic oxidation either under a pressure or a reduced pressure, in general, a pressure around an atmospheric pressure is suitable. (Examples)<br>
In what follows, the present invention will be more specifically explained with examples.<br>
A conversion ratio, selectivity and yield in these examples are defined as follows.<br>
•	Conversion ratio = (a number of moles of reacted<br>
methacrolein/a number of moles of supplied methacrolein) x 100<br>
•	Selectivity = (a number of moles of generated methacrylic acid/a number of moles of reacted methacrolein) x 100<br>
•	Yield = (a number of generated methacrylic acid/a number of moles of supplied methacrolein) x 100<br>
