				<td>The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of protein enriched parotta.<br>
Bakery products are an important source of nutrients viz. energy, protein, iron, calcium and several vitamins. Commercial bread and biscuits contain around 7 - 8% protein which is low. Most bakery products can easily be enriched and fortified at low cost with proteins, various vitamins and minerals to meet the specific needs of the target groups and vulnerable sections of the population, who are undernourished and malnourished. Since enrichment can be easily carried out, it is very important that more nutritious products should be produced (Harish Kumar Sharma, Saurabh Tewari, Manav Singh and Prateek Goyal. 1998. Bakery products in next millenium. Beverage and Food World, 25, Pp 40, 46).<br>
Just as bread is staple food item in Western world, chapathi, phulka, nan, poori, South Indian parotta and North Indian parotta are the widely consumed traditional products in the Indian subcontinent. These wheat based products are becoming increasingly popular and are normally consumed with adjuncts in house holds, industrial canteens, restaurants etc. Although, lot of studies on the protein supplementation of western bakery products have been reported, there is very little work done on the protein enrichment of traditional Indian products. Hence protein supplementation of traditional products like South Indian parotta has great potential in improving the nutritive value of these commonly consumed items.<br>
Protein malnutrition is a serious problem for people whose diets consist mainly of cereal or starchy food. Refined wheat flour forms the main raw material for bakery products. Wheat flour protein quality can be improved by addition of supplements, which are high in lysine. Since soybean protein both compliments the amino acid profile of cereal protein and is economical, it has considerable potential for improving the nutritional status of large population of people who depend on cereal based diets. High protein soy products provide functional properties such as improved texture, moisture retention and crust colour. Soy protein isolate contains the highest percentage of protein among various soy products and are used in bakery goods for their emulsifying properties. (Riaz M.<br>
N. 1999 Health Baking with Soy Ingredients. Cereal Foods World 44 (3), 136 -139).<br>
Whey proteins are the best quality proteins available and have high PER (3.6) and possess almost all essential amino acids. Apart from being nutritious, whey proteins are highly functional and exhibit properties like solubility, gelation, water binding viscosity and emulsifying action. The whey protein concentrate (WPC) can be defined as product in which protein content is elevated by selective removal of non - protein solids and protein content ranges from 25 - 80 %. Whey protein concentrate has GRAS status and can be used in food products. The functional characteristics increase the value of WPC as an ingredient as its functionality can be tailor made to specific requirement. (Asif Sharma and Bhatia K. L. 1999. Functional properties of whey protein concentrates - A Review. Journal of Dairying, Foods and Home science 18 (3 &amp; 4), 141 - 154)<br>
The various additives used in the bakery industry are enzymes, surfactants, gluten, oxidants and reductants. Enzymes are biological catalysts with high specificity effective in small amounts and low usage levels make enzymes economical and practical for commercial application. Enzymes are natural, nontoxic food components and are preferred over chemical aids as food processing aids by consumers. Effect of enzymes in different bakery products include flour quality improvement and machinability of the dough. Enzymes are also used to enhance crust colour, bleach flour etc. The enzymes for use in bakery processing include the fungal and bacterial amylases, proteinases, pentosanases, etc. (Jennyland and Benjamin S.K. 1996. Application of enzymes in food processing. Critical Reviews In Food Science and Nutrition. 36. 437 - 463). Proteolytic enzymes are added to reduce mixing time and to modify rheological properties of doughs, mainly extensibility, and improve the dough flow. The mechanism of action of these enzymes includes cleavage of peptide bonds, resulting in the formation of smaller fragments like peptides and amino acids. (Kulp. K. 1993. Enzymes as dough improvers. In Advances in Baking Technology: eds, Kamel, B. S. and Stauffer, C. E. Pp 152 -178, VCH Publisher, Inc. New York).<br>
Addition of xylanases improves the handling properties of dough, oven spring and bread volume. (Rouau, X., El-Hayek, M. L. and Moreau D. 1994. Effect of an enzyme preparation containing pentosanases on the bread making quality of flours in relation to changes in pentosan properties. Journal of Cereal Science, 19, 259 - 272). Surfactants have been used to improve both the quality and shelf life of baked goods which have been yeast raised, chemically leavened or non leavened. (Stauffer C. E. 1990. Emulsifiers and dough strengthened. In Functional additives for bakery foods. Pp 69 - 124, New York; Van Noslrand Reinhold).<br>
Reference may be made to Elmusa Alia No WO 02060262 where in a dough conditioner for bread is disclosed which comprises an isolated soy protein, xylanase, fungal a - amylase, cellulase, ascorbic acid, sodium stearoyi lactylate and azodicarbonamide. Addition of the composition results in a loaf of bread containing at least 6.25 g of soy protein per 50 g serving of bread. The drawback of the process is that the above composition which is a mixture of several additives cannot be used for the preparation of parotta as the formulation and processing conditions are entirely different. The bread in the cited patent is a leavened product whereas parotta is not a leavened product.<br>
Reference may be made here to Indrani, D, Jyotsna Rajiv, Prabhasankar, P, Sai Manohar, R and Venkateswara Rao, G (Indian Patent 0223 / Del / 2002) wherein an enzyme composition consisting of xylanase and / or protease is disclosed for modifying the dough properties and improving the quality of parottas. The drawback of this patent is that it relates to quality improvement of parotta using enzymes and not preparation of high protein parottas.<br>
Reference may be made here to Ferrara; Peter J., US 4759934 wherein a process for preparing high protein bread is described. A process for producing a yeast leavened wheat bread comprising baking flour, vital wheat gluten, steam treated full fat wheat germ, soy concentrate sufficient to provide a final baked bread containing about 18-25 % protein. The drawback here is that the product is bread and not parotta. The formulation and processing conditions of parotta are different from that of bread.<br>
Reference may be made here to Anfinsen Jon Robert WO 03049545 wherein a high protein, low carbohydrate dough and bread products and method for making the same is disclosed and the dough containing atleast 5 % vital wheat gluten a moisture managing agent, a hydrolysed wheat protein, a fungal protease enzyme, a milk protein or soy protein hydrocolloid forms the ingredients of dough composition and also bread. The drawback here is that the product is bread and not parotta. The formulation and preparation methodology for parotta are very different from that of bread.<br>
Reference may be made to Roza, M and Maat, J. EP0396162 wherein bread improvers are disclosed which comprises xylanase, oxidase or peroxidase. The mixture is incorporated into flour as an additive to bread or other baked dough products such as puff pastry. The drawback of the process is that the product is bread and not high protein parotta, the processing of which is entirely different from baked products.<br>
Reference may be made to Cox and Duanes S. 4158069 wherein the preparation of enriched wheat macaroni is stated. The enriched wheat macaroni product comprises of about 88.45 % semolina, 5.6 % of denatured dried whey solids containing 50 % whey protein, 4 % calcium caseinate, 1.2 % wheat gluten and about 0.75 % L Lysine where by said product in finished cooked form has a protein quantity of atleast 20 %. The drawback here is that the macaroni is an extruded product where as ingredients, formulation and processing conditions are entirely different from parotta.<br>
Reference may be made here to JP 61028347 where in a cake rich in vegetable protein is baked which comprises the following ingredients wheat flour, vegetable oils or fats, starch, starch syrup converted to maltose and refined soy bean protein powder. The drawback here is that the product is cake and not parotta, the characteristics of which are very different from that of cake.<br>
Reference may be made here to US 5320859 wherein a high protein dough mix invention is described. A high protein dough mix for a leavened bakery<br>
product consisting of a blend of water, 10-80% of a protein containing material selected from soy products, gluten, milk products, whey products, egg products and nuts, 10-80% of sweetner, 40% of vegetable shortening or animal fat, 50% flour and upto 8% of leavening agent. The dough mix may be baked and served as a cake, cookie, muffin etc. The drawback here is that the products are bakery products and not parotta.<br>

2.	Resting of dough for 30 min at 30° C and 75% RH.<br>
3.	Dividing the dough into 75 g each and rounding.<br>
4.	Sheeting the rounded dough with application of oil on the surface of the dough into a very thin film and without any tearing.<br>

7.	Baking for 230° C for 4 min while turning at every 1 min.<br>
8.	Pressing the parotta immediately after baking from both the sides to facilitate opening up of the layers.<br>
9.	Cooling and packing.<br>
10.	Evaluation of parottas for their physical and sensory characteristics.<br>
Experiments were conducted by preparing control parotta and protein enriched parottas using 2 different formulations. Parottas were evaluated for physical characteristics like weight, diameter and thickness. The spread ratio of parotta was calculated by dividing values of the diameter by values of the thickness. The shear value of parotta was determined by measuring the force required to shear a piece (2 cm width, 6 cm length and 0.5 cm height) of parotta using the Instron tester under the following conditions ; load cell, 10 kg, plunger speed, 100 mm/min ; Warner - Bratzler shear attachment. The sensory analysis of parotta samples based on the score card (Fig 1) was carried out by a panel of six trained judges by assigning scores for various quality attributes, namely colour, nature of spots, shape, handfeel, texture, layers, oiliness, mouthfeel and taste and aroma. The overall quality score was taken as the combined score of all nine quality attributes.<br>
Fig 1. Reference score card for sensory evaluation of parotta<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Overall quality: Excellent (100-90), very good (89-80), good (79-70), satisfactory (69-60), fair (59-50), poor (49-40), very poor (39-30), not acceptable 
The parotta dough prepared using formulation 1 when compared to control dough was elastic, lacked stretchability and the parotta dough prepared using formulation 2 was soft, easy to stretch into a thin and extensible film. The objective evaluation of parotta prepared using formulation 1 showed reduced diameter (148 mm), spread ratio (26.4), overall quality score (66), increased thickness (5.6 mm), shear force (1520 g) when compared to control parotta (Table 1). While preparation of parotta using formulation 2 when compared to control parotta showed increased diameter (155 mm), spread ratio (33.7), reduced thickness (4.6 mm) and shear force (1240 g). The sensory evaluation of parottas showed that the control parotta had creamish white color, circular shape, soft pliable handfeel, distinct layers and clean mouthfeel. Parotta using formulation 1 had dull white colour, reduced size circular shape, slightly hard handfeel, thick layers and parottas offered more resistance to bite. While parotta using formulation 2 had dull white colour, circular shape, very soft pliable handfeel, distinct layers and parottas were easy to disintegrate in the mouth. The above data is indicated in the sensory score for different parameters and the overall quality score which was 75 for control parotta and 66 and 74 for parottas using formulations 1 and 2 respectively. This indicates possibility of preparing protein enriched parotta almost similar to control using formulation 2.<br>
Table 1: Effect of different protein sources and additives on the quality of<br>
parotta<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Control formulation: Wheat flour, salt and water<br>
Formulation 1: Wheat flour, salt, whey protein concentrate, soy protein concentrate,<br>
dry gluten powder and water<br>
Formulation 2: Wheat flour, salt, whey protein concentrate, soy protein concentrate,<br>
dry gluten powder, xylanase, protease, sodium stearoyl-2-lactylate and water<br>
SEM Studies:<br>
Experiments were conducted by preparing control parotta and parotta with improved formulation in order to find out the micro structure of control and protein enriched parotta. The results showed that in the micrograph (fig 2) of control parotta, starch granules were found embedded in a very thin protein matrix, whereas in parotta prepared using improved formulation the starch granules were not properly visible and there was a dense protein matrix. This confirms protein enrichment in parottas prepared using improved formulation.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
