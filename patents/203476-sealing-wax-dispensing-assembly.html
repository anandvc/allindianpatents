SEALING WAX DISPENSING ASSEMBLY;<br>
BARVE ARUN SUBHASH AN INDIAN NATIONAL OF 906, SHIVAJI NAGAR, DECCAN GYMKHANA, PUNE - 411 004, MAHARASHTRA, INDIA;<br>
THE	FOLLOWING	SPECIFICATION<br>
PARTICULARLY DESCRIBES THE NATURE OF THIS INVENTION AND THE MANNER IN WHICH IT IS TO BE PERFOMED.<br><br>
TITLE<br>
SEALING WAX DISPENSING ASSEMBLY<br>
Field of invention<br>
The present invention relates to a sealing wax dispensing assembly. The present invention relates particularly to a sealing wax dispensing assembly for melting sealing wax used for various purposes such as sealing of various envelops and parcels used by postal department, and for various confidential documents.<br>
Background art<br>
In prior art, the sealing wax dispensing operation is known to be carried out manually by melting the wax by fire and then dispensing on the substrate directly. Alternatively, the wax to be disposed is kept in a pan (Kadhai) or pot and the pot is heated on a stove or by any other heating means. Then the said molten material is dispensed on the substrate by spoon or any other such object.<br>
Following are the disadvantage of the prior art:<br>
1.	Fire hazards : - the substrate has to be kept very near to the fire.<br>
2.	The smoke coming out from the material (sealing wax) is injurious to health.<br>
3.	Due to uncontrollable heating loss of material  and wastage is unavoidable.<br>
4.	Accident hazard due to manual operation.<br><br>
Summary of the invention<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a sealing wax dispensing assembly, which is not fire hazardous and also environment friendly.<br>
Accordingly, the sealing wax dispensing assembly comprises a hollow cylinder and a cup shaped hub capable of holding the sealing wax, coupled to the said hollow cylinder from bottom. The cup shaped hub has a hole at centre bottom with flow nozzle provided from outside. A flow stopper is provided which passes through the said hole at centre bottom, stretching downward in the said flow nozzle. A shaft extends downward into the said cylinder coupled to the said flow stopper and in turn is coupled to a spring assembly in order to lift the flow stopper.<br>
Brief description of the drawings<br>
Other objects and advantages residing in the present invention will become apparent from the description to follow when considered in connection with the accompanying drawings where in :<br>
Fig. 1 is the vertical cross section of the sealing wax dispensing assembly, according to the present invention.<br>
Fig. 2 is side view of the hollow cylinder and hub.<br>
Fig. 3 is side view of the flow stopper mechanism.<br>
Fig. 4 is side view of the nozzle.<br><br>
Detailed description of the invention and preferred embodiments thereof<br>
Referring to figure 1, the sealing wax dispensing assembly, according to the present invention comprises a container for accommodating a sealing wax material preferably in solid form, which has a first portion hereinafter referred to as a hollow cylinder (1) which is preferably open at both the ends and a second portion hereinafter referred to as a cup shaped hub (5) having an internal threading (6) at the upper end (7).<br>
The hollow cylinder (1) has an external threading at lower end which fits into the internal threading (6) of the cup shaped hub (5). The cup shaped hub (5) is capable of holding the liquid sealing material. A heating source such as heating jacket (8) is mounted on the outer surface of the said hollow cylinder (1) to heat the said solid sealing material inserted, to the desired melting point (refer figure 2). Heating increases the fluidity of the sealing material. Heating of the said hollow cylinder (1) is controlled by the duty cycle heating controller, provided separately (not shown in the figs.). The said cup shaped hub (5) is having a constricting hole hereinafter referred to as a bore (9) at the center of the bottom (10). A nozzle (11) is screw-fitted to the outer surface of the bottom (10) of the said cup shaped hub (5) such that the nozzle (11) corresponds to the said bore (9) through which the said sealing material flows.<br>
Heating means such as jacket heating (12) is provided on the outer surface of the said cup shaped hub (5) to heat the semi solid sealing material (refer figure 2). The temperature of the said cup shaped hub (5) is kept more than the temperature of the said cylinder (1) purposely for melting the sealing material further. Heating of the said cup shaped hub<br><br>
(5) is again controlled by the duty cycle heating controller provided separately (not shown in figs.).<br>
Referring to figure 3, which is the cross sectional view of a stopper member hereinafter referred to as a flow stopper (12). The said flow stopper (12) has a threaded upper portion (13), tapered middle portion<br>
(14)	and lower pointed portion (15). The construction of the flow stopper (12) is such that the said middle taper portion (14) fits in to the bottom thickness of the said cup shaped hub.   The said lower pointed portion<br>
(15)	goes inside the said nozzle (11) and the upper threaded portion fits in to the shaft (16) provided thereto.<br>
Now again referring to figure 1. there is provided a shaft (16) extending downward into the said hollow cylinder (1). The said shaft (16) has threading, capable of holding the upper portion (13) of the flow stopper (12). The said shaft (16) in turn is connected to the spring assembly (not shown in figures) capable of tracting the said shaft holding the said flow stopper (12). When the said shaft is lifted upward as shown in the figure the tapered middle portion (14) of the said flow stopper (12) releases from the bottom thickness of the said cup shaped hub (5) and gap (17) is created in between allowing the molten material to flow down by gravity. The material, which flows through the said-nozzle (11) and falls down on the paper provided below the said nozzle (11). In case of any blockage, the said lower portion (15) of the flow stopper (12) clears the blockage. The total volume of the molten sealing material to be dispensed is controlled by the total tracked time of the shaft (16). Manual operation or pneumatic solenoid operation or electrical solenoid operation or<br><br>
electrically motorized operation can achieve traction of the said shaft (16).<br>
While the invention has been described with reference to the preferred embodiments, those will understand it skilled in the art that various changes may be made and equivalents may be substituted for elements thereof without departing from the scope of the invention. In addition, many modifications may be made to adopt the particular situation or materials to the teachings of the invention without departing from essential scope thereof. Therefore, it is intended that the invention not be limited to the particular embodiment disclosed as the best mode contemplated or carrying out this invention, but that the invention will include all the embodiments falling within the scope of the appended claims.<br><br>
