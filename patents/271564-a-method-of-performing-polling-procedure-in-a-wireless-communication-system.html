				<td>A METHOD OF PERFORMING POLLING PROCEDURE<br>
IN A WIRELESS COMMUNICATION SYSTEM<br>
[DESCRIPTION]<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a wireless communication system, and more<br>
particularly, to a method of generating a data block for performing a polling procedure<br>
in a wireless communication system, a method of transmitting data and a method of<br>
performing a polling procedure.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Various types of data retransmission methods can be used to ensure certainty of<br>
data transmission to a receiving side in a wireless communication system. Particularly,<br>
the need to use a retransmission method increases when the receiving side should<br>
necessarily receive non-real time packet data such as signaling data or TCP/IP data.<br>
An example of the data transmission method used in the wireless<br>
communication system will be described as follows. The receiving side transmits a<br>
status report to a transmitting side to report that at least one or more data blocks<br>
transmitted from the transmitting side have been successfully received. The transmitting<br>
side retransmits data blocks that the receiving side has failed to receive, to the receiving<br>
side using the status report. For application of the retransmission method, data which<br>
have been transmitted once should be stored in a buffer for a certain time period without<br>
discard. Accordingly, a transmission buffer and a retransmission buffer are required,<br>
wherein data which have never been transmitted to the receiving side are stored in the<br>
transmission buffer and data which have been transmitted to the receiving side but need<br>
to be on standby for retransmission are stored in the retransmission buffer.<br>
The transmitting side can request the receiving side to transmit the status report.<br>
This procedure is referred to as a polling procedure. If the status report transmitted from<br>
the receiving side is lost during transmission or the receiving side does not transmit the<br>
status report to the transmitting side timely, the transmitting side can perform the<br>
polling procedure. Alternatively, the transmitting side can perform the polling procedure<br>
periodically.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
A transmitting side has to use additional radio resources to perform a polling<br>
procedure. Accordingly, for efficient use of radio resources, the polling procedure<br>
should be prevented from being used unnecessarily. To this end, reasonable standards as<br>
to when the transmitting side should perform the polling procedure are required.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention is directed to a method of generating a data<br>
block for performing a polling procedure in a wireless communication system, a method<br>
of transmitting data and a method of performing a polling procedure, which<br>
substantially obviate one or more problems due to limitations and disadvantages of the<br>
related art.<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide a method of generating a data<br>
block for performing a polling procedure in a wireless communication system, a method<br>
of transmitting data and a method of performing a polling procedure, in which the<br>
polling procedure is performed while radio resources are being used efficiently.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a method of generating a<br>
data block for performing a polling procedure in a wireless communication system, a<br>
method of transmitting data and a method of performing a polling procedure, in which a<br>
transmitting side performs the polling procedure timely to prevent communication from<br>
being stopped unexpectedly.<br>
In a wireless communication system, a data retransmission function is<br>
performed by a specific protocol layer. To perform the data retransmission function, the<br>
protocol layer is equipped with a transmission buffer and a retransmission buffer. The<br>
protocol layer can determine whether to perform a polling procedure considering<br>
statuses of the transmission buffer and the retransmission buffer, i.e., the amount of data<br>
stored in the transmission buffer and the retransmission buffer.<br>
In one aspect of the present invention, the protocol layer performs the polling<br>
procedure for requesting a receiving side to transmit a status report if there are no data<br>
to be transmitted to the receiving side in both the transmission buffer and the<br>
retransmission buffer. When determining whether there are no data to be transmitted to<br>
the receiving side in the retransmission buffer, it is preferable that a data block for<br>
which retransmission request information is not received from the receiving side is<br>
excluded.<br>
In another aspect of the present invention, the protocol layer performs the<br>
polling procedure considering the amount of data transmitted to the receiving side.<br>
Namely, the protocol layer performs the polling procedure if the amount of data<br>
transmitted to the receiving side reaches a certain level or greater. This procedure can be<br>
performed repeatedly.<br>
According to the present invention, radio resources can efficiently be used<br>
during the polling procedure, and the transmitting side can perform the polling<br>
procedure timely, whereby communication can be prevented from being slopped<br>
unexpectedly.<br>

BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
Hereinafter, structures, operations, and other features of the present invention<br>
will be understood readily by the preferred embodiments of the present invention,<br>
examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings. Embodiments<br>
described later are examples in which technical features of the present invention are<br>
applied to an E-UMTS (Evolved Universal Mobile Telecommunications System).<br>
However, it should be noted that an embodiment of the present invention can be applied<br>
to a wireless communication system other that the E-UMTS.<br>
FIG. 1 is a diagram illustrating a network structure of an E-UMTS. An E-<br>
UMTS is a system evolving from the conventional WCDMA UMTS and its basic<br>
standardization is currently handled by the 3GPP (3rd Generation Partnership Project).<br>
The E-UMTS can also be called an LTE (Long Term Evolution) system.<br>
Referring to FIG. 1, an E-UTRAN includes base stations (hereinafter, referred<br>
to as 'eNode B' or 'eNB'), wherein respective eNBs are connected with each other<br>
through X2 interface. Also, each of eNBs is connected with a user equipment (UE)<br>
through a radio interface and connected with EPC (Evolved Packet Core) through SI<br>
interface. The EPC includes a mobility management entity/system architecture<br>
evolution (MME/SAE) gateway.<br>
Layers of a radio interface protocol between a user equipment and a network<br>
can be classified into a first layer L1, a second layer L2 and a third layer L3 based on<br>
three lower layers of OSI (open system interconnection) standard model widely known<br>
in communication systems. A physical layer belonging to the first layer L1 provides<br>
an information transfer service using a physical channel. A radio resource control<br>
(hereinafter abbreviated as 'RRC') located at the third layer plays a role in controlling<br>
radio resources between the user equipment and the network. For this, the RRC layer<br>
enables RRC messages to be exchanged between the UE and the network. The RRC<br>
layer can be distributively located at network nodes including Node B, an AG and the<br>
like or can be independently located at either the Node B or the AG.<br>
FIG. 2 is a schematic view illustrating an E-UTRAN (Evolved Universal<br>
Terrestrial Radio Access Network). In FIG. 2, a hatching part represents functional<br>
entities of a user plane, and a non-hatching part represents functional entities of a<br>
control plane.<br>
FIG. 3A and FIG. 3B illustrate a structure of a radio interface protocol between<br>
the user equipment (UE) and the E-UTRAN, in which FIG. 3A is a schematic view of a<br>
control plane protocol and FIG. 3B is a schematic view of a user plane protocol.<br>
Referring to FIG. 3A and FIG 3B, a radio interface protocol horizontally includes a<br>
physical layer, a data link layer, and a network layer, and vertically includes a user plane<br>
for data information transfer and a control plane for signaling transfer. The protocol<br>
layers in FIG. 3A and FIG. 3B can be classified into LI (first iayer), L2 (second layer),<br>
and L3 (third layer) based on three lower layers of the open system interconnection<br>
(OSI) standard model widely known in the communications systems.<br>
The physical layer as the first layer provides an information transfer service to<br>
an upper layer using physical channels. The physical layer (PHY) is connected to a<br>
medium access control (hereinafter, abbreviated as 'MAC') layer above the physical<br>
layer via transport channels. Data are transferred between the medium access control<br>
layer and the physical layer via the transport channels. Moreover, data are transferred<br>
between different physical layers, and more particularly, between one physical layer of a<br>
transmitting side and the other physical layer of a receiving side via the physical<br>
channels. The physical channel of the E-UMTS is modulated in accordance with an<br>
orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) scheme, and time and frequency<br>
are used as radio resources.<br>
The medium access control (hereinafter, abbreviated as ;MAC) layer of the<br>
second layer provides a service to a radio link control (hereinafter, abbreviated as<br>
'RLC') layer above the MAC layer via logical channels. The RLC layer of the second<br>
layer supports reliable data transfer. In order to effectively transmit data using IP<br>
packets (e.g., IPv4 or IPv6) within a radio-communication period having a narrow<br>
bandwidth, a PDCP layer of the second layer (L2) performs header compression to<br>
reduce the size of unnecessary control information.<br>
A radio resource control (hereinafter, abbreviated as 'RRC) layer located on a<br>
lowest part of the third layer is defined in the control plane only and is associated with<br>
configuration, reconfiguration and release of radio bearers (hereinafter, abbreviated as<br>
'RBs') to be in charge of controlling the logical, transport and physical channels. In<br>
this case, the RB means a service provided by the second layer for the data transfer<br>
between the user equipment and the UTRAN.<br>
Examples of downlink transport channels carrying data from the network to the<br>
user equipments include a broadcast channel (BCH) carrying system information, a<br>
paging channel (PCH) carrying paging message, and a downlink shared channel (SCH)<br>
carrying user traffic or control messages. The traffic or control messages of a<br>
downlink multicast or broadcast service can be transmitted via the downlink SCH or an<br>
additional downlink multicast channel (MCH). Meanwhile, examples of uplink<br>
transport channels carrying data from the user equipments to the network include a<br>
random access channel (RACH) carrying an initial control message and an uplink<br>
shared channel (UL-SCH) carrying user traffic or controi message.<br>
Examples of logical channels located above the transport channels and mapped<br>
with the transport channels include a broadcast control channel (BCCH), a paging<br>
control channel (PCCH), a common control channel (CCCH), a multicast control<br>
channel (MCCH), and a multicast traffic channel (MTCH).<br>
As described above, the RLC layer of the second layer supports reliable data<br>
transfer. Also, the RLC layer serves to perform segmentation and/or concatenation for<br>
data received from its upper layer to control a size of the data so that the lower layer can<br>
transmit the data to a radio interval. Also, in order to ensure various quality of services<br>
(QoS) required by each radio bearer, the RLC layer of the second layer provides three<br>
types of operation modes, transparent mode (TM), un-acknowledged mode (UM), and<br>
an acknowledged mode (AM). Particularly, the AM RLC layer performs a<br>
retransmission function through an automatic repeat and request (ARQ) function for<br>
reliable data transmission. Hereinafter, the UM mode and the AM mode of the RLC<br>
layer will be described in more detail.<br>
The UM RLC layer transmits PDUs by adding a PDU header to each PDU, so<br>
that the receiving side can identify what PDU has been lost during transmission,<br>
wherein the PDU header includes a sequence number (hereinafter, abbreviated as "SN").<br>
In accordance with this function, the UM RLC layer mainly serves to transmit<br>
broadcast/multicast data or real-time data such as voice (for example, VoIP) or<br>
streaming of a packet service domain (hereinafter, abbreviated as "PS domain") in a<br>
user plane. Also, the UM RLC layer serves to transmit RRC message, which does not<br>
need acknowledgement, among RRC messages transmitted to a specific user equipment<br>
or a specific user equipment group within a cell, in a control plane.<br>
Like the UM RLC layer, the AM RLC layer constitutes RLC PDUs by adding a<br>
PDU header including SN thereto. However, the AM RLC layer is different from the<br>
UM RLC layer in that the receiving side performs acknowledgement in response to the<br>
PDUs transmitted from the transmitting side. The reason why the receiving side<br>
performs acknowledgement in the AM RLC layer is to request the transmitting side to<br>
re-transmit PDU which the receiving side has not received. This retransmission function<br>
is a main feature of the AM RLC layer. Accordingly, the AM RLC layer is to ensure<br>
error-free data transmission through re-transmission. For this reason, the AM RLC layer<br>
serves to transmit unreal time packet data such as TCP/IP of the PS domain in the user<br>
plane. Also, the AM RLC layer serves to transmit RRC message, which necessarily<br>
requires acknowledgement, among the RRC messages transmitted to a specific user<br>
equipment within a cell, in the control plane.<br>
In view of a directional aspect, the UM RLC layer is used for uni-directional<br>
communication whereas the AM RLC layer is used for bi-directional communication<br>
due to a feedback from the receiving side. The UM RLC layer is also different from the<br>
AM RLC layer in view of a structural aspect. Namely, although the UM RLC layer<br>
allows one RLC entity to perform a transmission function or a receiving function, the<br>
AM RLC layer allows both an entity performing a transmission function and an entity<br>
performing a receiving function to exist in one RLC entity.<br>
The reason why that the AM RLC layer is complicated is caused by a<br>
retransmission function. For retransmission management, the AM RLC entity includes a<br>
retransmission buffer in addition to a transmission buffer and uses a transmission and<br>
reception window for flow control. The AM RLC entity of the transmitting side<br>
performs a polling procedure to request a peer RLC entity of the receiving side to<br>
transmit a status report, and the receiving side transmits the status report to the<br>
transmitting side to report reception acknowledgement information. Also, the AM RLC<br>
entity performs a function constituting a status PDU to transfer the status report.<br>
The AM RLC entity supports the aforementioned functions using a plurality of<br>
protocol parameters, status parameters, timers, etc. In the AM RLC layer, PDUs used to<br>
control transmission of data such as status report or status PDU will be referred to as<br>
control PDUs, and PDUs used to transfer user data will be referred to as data PDUs.<br>
As described above, the AM RLC entity of the transmitting side includes two<br>
buffers, i.e., a transmission buffer and a retransmission buffer. Data which have not yet<br>
been included in RLC PDU, among data transferred from an upper entity, are stored in<br>
the transmission buffer. RLC PDU transferred to a lower entity is stored in the<br>
retransmission buffer until the receiving side acknowledges that the RLC PDU has been<br>
successfully received therein.<br>
FIG. 4 is a diagram illustrating an example of a functional block of the RLC<br>
AM entity.<br>
Referring to FIG 4, an RLC SDU (Service Data Unit) transferred from the<br>
upper layer (RRC layer or PDCP sub-layer) is stored in a transmission buffer 41. A<br>
segmentation/concatenation module 42 performs segmentation and/or concatenation for<br>
at least one RLC SDU transferred from the transmission buffer 41. Segmentation and/or<br>
concatenation is performed at a specific transmission opportunity in accordance with a<br>
transport block size reported from the lower layer. As a result, the RLC PDU generated<br>
by the RLC AM entity can have a size desired by the lower layer. An RLC header<br>
adding module 43 adds an RLC header to a data block transferred from the<br>
segmentation/concatenation module 42. An RLC AMD PDU is generated as the RLC<br>
PDU header is added to the data block.<br>
FIG. 5 is a diagram illustrating a basic structure of the AMD PDU. The AMD<br>
PDU includes a PDU header part and a data field part. The header can include a fixed<br>
part and an extended part, wherein the fixed part exists in every AMD PDU and the<br>
extended part is included in the AMD PDU only if necessary. The extended part is<br>
included in the AMD PDU if one or more data field elements exist in the AMD PDU.<br>
The fixed part includes a D/C field, a re-segmentation flag (RF) field, a polling<br>
(P) field, a framing info (Fl) field, an extension bit (E) field and a sequence number<br>
(SN) field. The D/C field includes information identifying whether a corresponding<br>
AMD PDU is a data PDU or a control PDU. The RF field includes information<br>
indicating whether a corresponding RLC PDU is a single perfect AMD PDU or a part of<br>
another AMD PDU. The polling field includes information indicating whether the AM<br>
RLC entity of the transmitting side will request the peer AM RLC entity of the receiving<br>
side to transmit status report. The Fl field includes information indicating that the RLC<br>
SDU included in the AMD PDU has been segmented from a start part and/or an end part<br>
of the data field. The E field includes information indicating whether the data field starts<br>
behind the fixed part or whether additional E field and LI field follow behind the fixed<br>
part. The SN field includes a sequence number of the AMD PDU.<br>
Referring to FIG. 4 again, the AMD PDU generated as the header is added by<br>
the RLC header adding module 43 is transferred to the lower layer, for example, a MAC<br>
layer. Before the AMD PDU is transferred to the lower layer, additional procedure such<br>
as ciphering can be performed for the AMD PDU if necessary. The AMD PDU<br>
transferred to the lower layer is stored in the retransmission buffer 44 to perform a<br>
retransmission function.<br>
If the RLC AM entity performs a receiving function, a routing module 46<br>
performs routing for the received RLC PDU in accordance with a type of the RLC PDU,<br>
so as to transfer a control PDU to an RLC control module 45 and an AMD PDU to a<br>
receiving buffer/HARQ reordering module 47. The receiving buffer/HARQ reordering<br>
module 47 stores AMD PDUs transferred from the routing module 46, and aligns them<br>
in the order of SN if they are not received in the order of SN. An RLC header removing<br>
module 48 removes the RLC header from the AMD PDU and transfers the resultant data<br>
to an SDU reassembly module 49. The SDU reassembly module 49 reassembles at least<br>
one or more RLC SDUs using the data transferred from the RLC header removing<br>
module and then transfers the resultant data to the upper layer.<br>
The RLC AM entity of the receiving side transfers the status report lo the<br>
transmitting side through the status PDU to report whether the at least one or more RLC<br>
PDUs transmitted from the transmitting side have been successfully received.<br>
FIG. 6 is a flow chart illustrating a procedure according to one embodiment of<br>
the present invention. The embodiment of FIG. 6 relates to an example of determining<br>
whether the RLC AM entity performs a polling procedure in accordance with the<br>
statuses of the transmission buffer and the retransmission buffer. Namely, if there are<br>
no data to be transmitted to the receiving side in both the transmission buffer and the<br>
retransmission buffer, the RLC AM entity performs the polling procedure to request the<br>
receiving side to transmit the status report. When determining whether there are data to<br>
be transmitted to the receiving side in the retransmission buffer, a data block for which<br>
etransmission request information is not received from the receiving side is excluded.<br>
Referring to FIG. 4 and FIG. 6, the AM RLC entity checks the status of the<br>
ransmission buffer 41 [S61] and identifies whether data to be transmitted to the<br>
receiving side are stored in the transmission buffer 4] [S62]. If the data to be<br>
transmitted to the receiving side are stored in the transmission buffer 41, the AM RLC<br>
entity does not perform the polling procedure. Namely, the AM RLC entity sets the P<br>
field to "0," wherein the P field exists in a header of the AMD PDU to be transmitted to<br>
the receiving side [S66]. If the P field receives the AMD PDU set to "0," the receiving<br>
side regards that the transmitting side does not request transmission of the status report.<br>
If the data to be transmitted to the receiving side are not stored in the<br>
transmission buffer 41, i.e., if the transmission buffer 41 is empty, the AM RLC entity<br>
checks the status of the retransmission buffer 44 [S63] to identify whether data to be<br>
transmitted to the receiving side are stored in the retransmission buffer [S64]. When<br>
determining whether the data to be transmitted to the receiving side are stored in the<br>
retransmission buffer 44, a data block for which retransmission request information is<br>
not received from the receiving side is excluded. In other words, even though at least<br>
one RLC PDU is stored in the retransmission buffer 44, if the status report or<br>
acknowledgement for the at least one RLC PDU is not received from the receiving side,<br>
it is regarded that the retransmission buffer 44 is empty.<br>
In step S64, if the data to be transmitted to the receiving side are stored in the<br>
retransmission buffer 44, the AM RLC entity does not perform the polling procedure.<br>
Namely, the AM RLC entity sets the P field to "0," wherein the P field exists in the<br>
header of the AMD PDU to be transmitted to the receiving side [S66].<br>
If the data to be transmitted to the receiving side are not stored in the<br>
retransmission buffer 44, the AM RLC entity performs the polling procedure. Namely,<br>
the AM RLC entity sets the P field to "1," wherein the P field exists in the header of the<br>
AMD PDU to be transmitted to the receiving side [S65]. If the P field receives the AMD<br>
PDU set to "1", the receiving side regards that the transmitting side requests<br>
transmission of the status report, and transmits to the transmitting side the status report<br>
for at least one RLC PDU received from the transmitting side.<br>
In the embodiment of FIG. 6, although the status of the retransmission buffer<br>
has been checked after the status of the transmission buffer is checked, this checking<br>
order may be changed. Namely, the status of the transmission buffer may be checked<br>
after the status of the retransmission buffer is checked. Also, the status of the<br>
transmission buffer and the status of the retransmission buffer may simultaneously be<br>
checked.<br>
FIG. 7 is a diagram illustrating the embodiment of FIG. 6 in view of another<br>
aspect. In FIG. 7, a horizontal axis is a lime axis, and a vertical axis represents the<br>
amount of data stored in the transmission buffer and the retransmission buffer.<br>
Although the transmission buffer is empty at a timing point "A," since data to be<br>
transmitted to the receiving side are stored in the retransmission buffer, the polling<br>
procedure is not triggered. The data to be transmitted to the receiving side will not<br>
remain in the transmission buffer and the retransmission buffer at a timing point "B" At<br>
this time, the AM RLC layer performs the polling procedure.<br>
There are no data to be transmitted to the receiving side in the transmission<br>
buffer at a timing point "C" but at least one RLC PDU is stored in the retransmission<br>
buffer. However, if acknowledgements for the at least one RLC PDU stored in the<br>
retransmission buffer is not received from the receiving side, it is regarded that there are<br>
no data to be transmitted to the receiving side in the retransmission buffer. Accordingly,<br>
the RLC AM entity performs the polling procedure even at the timing point "C."<br>
Although the retransmission buffer is empty at a timing point "D," since data to be<br>
transmitted to the receiving side are stored in the transmission buffer, the RLC AM<br>
entity does not perform the polling procedure.<br>
According to other embodiments of the present invention, it is considered that<br>
the RLC AM entity performs the polling procedure considering the sequence number of<br>
the RLC PDU in addition to the status of the transmission buffer and the status of the<br>
retransmission buffer. Namely, in a state that data to be transmitted to the receiving side<br>
do not remain in the transmission buffer and the retransmission buffer, the polling<br>
procedure can be performed for each of the following cases:<br>
1. When an AMD PDU stored in the retransmission buffer is transmitted, in<br>
case where the AMD PDU has the highest sequence number among AMD PDUs to be<br>
retransmitted;<br>
2. When an AMD PDU stored in the retransmission buffer is transmitted, in<br>
case where the AMD PDU has the highest sequence number among AMD PDUs for<br>
which status report indicating that the receiving side has not received successfully the<br>
AMD PDUs is received;<br>
3. When an AMD PDU stored in the retransmission buffer is transmitted, in<br>
case where the AMD PDU is generated most recently among AMD PDUs to be<br>
retransmitted;<br>
4. When an AMD PDU stored in the retransmission buffer is transmitted, in<br>
case where the AMD PDU is generated most recently among AMD PDUs for which<br>
NACKs have been received from the receiving side;<br>
5. When an AMD PDU is transmitted from the transmission buffer, in case<br>
where the AMD PDU is generated most recently;<br>
6. When an AMD PDU is transmitted from the transmission buffer, in case<br>
where data to be trancemitted to the receiving side do not remain in the transmission<br>
buffer and the retransmission buffer any more;<br>
7. When an AMD PDU is transmitted from the transmission buffer, in case<br>
where neither data to be transmitted to the receiving side nor AMD PDU to be<br>
retransmitted remain in the transmission buffer;<br>
8. When an AMD PDU is transmitted from the transmission buffer, in case<br>
where neither data to be transmitted to the receiving side nor AMD PDU waiting for<br>
retransmission remain in the transmission buffer;<br>
9. When an AMD PDU is transmitted from the transmission buffer, in case<br>
where data to be transmitted to the receiving side do not remain in the transmission<br>
buffer any more and at the same time an AMD PDU for which NACK has been received<br>
from the receiving side does not remain in the retransmission buffer;<br>
10. When an AMD PDU is transmitted from the retransmission buffer, in case<br>
where the AMD PDU has the highest sequence number among the AMD PDUs to be<br>
retransmitted, and data to be transmitted to the receiving side do not remain in the<br>
transmission buffer;<br>
11. When an AMD PDU is transmitted from the retransmission buffer, in case<br>
where the AMD PDU has the highest sequence number among the AMD PDUs for<br>
which NACKs have been received from the receiving side, and data to be transmitted to<br>
the receiving side do not remain in the transmission buffer; and<br>
12. When an AMD PDU is transmitted from the retransmission buffer, in case<br>
where the AMD PDU is generated most recently among the AMD PDUs to be<br>
retransmitted, and data to be transmitted to the receiving side do not remain in the<br>
transmission buffer.<br>
FIG 8 is a diagram illustrating another embodiment of the present invention. In<br>
the embodiment of FIG. 8, an AM RLC entity performs a polling procedure at the time<br>
when sum of data included in AMD PDUs transmitted to the receiving side reaches a<br>
threshold value, which is previously set.<br>
Referring to FIG 8, supposing that PDU 1 to PDU 5 are transmitted to the<br>
receiving side in due order, sum of the data transmitted to the receiving side reaches a<br>
threshold value or greater at the time when PDU 5 is transmitted. At this time, the AM<br>
RLC entity performs the polling procedure. Namely, the AM RLC entity requests the<br>
receiving side to transmit the status report by setting a P field included in a header of<br>
PDU 5 to "1".<br>
If the polling procedure is performed once, sum of data calculated to trigger the<br>
polling procedure is calculated again from the beginning. Namely, in FIG 8, since sum<br>
of data exceeds the threshold value at the time when PDU 6 to PDU 13 are transmitted<br>
after the polling procedure is performed through PDU 5, the P field included in a header<br>
of PDU 13 is set to "I" again.<br>
The embodiment of FIG 8 can be achieved using a parameter named<br>
BYTE_SENT. Namely, BYTE_SENT is initiated to 0, and the RLC AM entity adds a<br>
size value of data included in an AMD PDU to BYTE_SENT whenever the AMD PDU<br>
is transmitted. The RLC AM entity performs the polling procedure by selling the P field<br>
included in the header of the AMD PDU transmitted at the time when BYTE_SENT<br>
exceeds the threshold value to "1". If the polling procedure is performed, the RLC AM<br>
entity resets BYTE_SENT to "0" and repeats the same procedure.<br>
If the size of the data included in the AMD PDU transmitted to the receiving<br>
. side is added to BYTE_SENT, various methods can be considered with respect to what<br>
value is taken as the size of the data. As described above, an AMD PDU includes a<br>
header part and a data field part, wherein the header part includes a fixed part and an<br>
extended part. Accordingly, a total size of the AMD PDU, a size of the data field part, or<br>
the size of the other part excluding the fixed part in the header could be the part added<br>
to the value BYTE_SENT.<br>
For example, if the size of the data included in the data field part of the AMD<br>
PDU is only considered when sum of the size of the data is calculated, the data field is<br>
aligned per 1 byte. Accordingly, a counter can be increased per 1 byte of the data field<br>
included in each AMD PDU, and the polling procedure can be performed at the time<br>
when the counter value calculated for the AMD PDUs transmitted to the receiving side<br>
exceeds a predetermined threshold.<br>

elements and features of the present invention in a predetermined type. Each of the<br>
structural elements or features should be considered selectively unless specified<br>
