Wide range of harmonics further produce which amplifies selectively grass harmonic produced by the beeswax condenser. The connection of the system to the electrical grid is made in such a way that the electrical mainline works as an antenna with a screw driver tester lighting when the right phase is connected. Importantly the substance to be treated should never in contact with metals other than the electrodes.<br>
The system of the invention thus is adopted to generate high frequency waves or biowave which are transmitted to the water and the mass of activated carbon in contact with water by means of electrodes. Such high frequency waves generated by the system which are preferably of the order of about 1040 hertz, display on the oscilloscope, numerous high frequency impulsions which super impose onto the usual curve, a considerable number of harmonics known as "GRASS HARMONICS"<br>
The details of the invention, its objects and advantages are explained hereunder in greater details in relation to non limiting exemplary illustration of the system and its manner of operation involving generation of biowave to treat water in accordance with present invention as per the following accompanying figures :<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF FIGURES<br>
Figure 1 illustrates an embodiment of a flow diagram of water purifier cum dynamisation system in accordance with invention ;<br>
Figure 2 illustrates another embodiment of a flow diagram of water purifier cum dynamisation system in accordance with invention ;<br>
Reference is first invited to accompanying figure 1 which illustrates by way of a flow diagram the stages of dynamisation of fluid by high energy of biowave in accordance with the system of the invention. As illustrated in said figure, a pulse generator (2) with a variation of amplitude for instance between 50% and 300% powered by an<br><br>
alternative current supply (1) preferably 220 volts with 50 (or 60) hertz frequency is used to activate a high energy biowave generator (3).<br>
The biowave generator (3) is adapted to generate a variety of biowave harmonic which is conducted to various electrodes (4) such as made of silver. Such electrode is adapted to energize a mass of loosely compacted granules or particles (5) such as activated carbon containing in a container made of appropriate material (6) in which the liquid, for instance water to be treated is allowed to flow continuously from an inlet (7) at the top to an outlet (8) providing the dynamised water / liquid at the bottom.<br>
Reference in now invited to another embodiment of the stages involved in continuous dynamisation of fluids / water by high frequency biowave in accordance with the system/method of the invention.<br>
According to this embodiment as illustrated in said figure, alternative current supply preferably 220 volts with 50 (or 60) hertz frequency is transformed (1) to direct current preferably 12 volts for instance. The direct current is adapted to activate a pulse accelerator (2) with a variation of amplitude comprising between 50% and 300% for example from 12 to 24 volts.<br>
As further illustrated from the said figure, from the mainline of the A.C., to multipurpose condenser (3) are coupled with a condenser where beeswax has been used as a dielectric (4). The pulse generator is also connected to the beeswax condenser in order to promote a grade variety of harmonics.<br>
The high frequencies biowave thus generate are conducted to an electrode (6) preferably of metal silver. As shown in said figure, the electrode plunges into a mass of loosely compacted granules of particles, for example, of activated carbon (7) contain in the vessels, in which a liquid for instance water is allowed to flow continuously from an inlet (5) at the top and to an outlet (6) providing the dynamised / treated water.<br>
It is thus possible by way of the above invention to provide for a process by which activated  carbon  as  a  filtration  substrate  is  energized  or dynamised   by  high<br><br>
frequency biowave to impede the built-up bacterial colonies onto the filtration material. Importantly such dynamisation of activated carbon enhances the capacity of the activated carbon to absorb and degrade water containing substances like heavy metals and pesticides. Advantageously, the dynamisation of the activated carbon is transmitted to enhance the capacity of the activated carbon and thereby impart special energized property to the water which can be further identified by copper chloride crystallization, eye crystal photography, Kirtian photography etc. The invention is thus directed to provide for a simple, cost effective and reliable manner of treating water / liquid / solid by effective decontamination by imparting energy / dynamism characteristics of high frequency biowave which is directed to meet large scale demands for effective processes for providing quality po table water.<br><br><br><br>
