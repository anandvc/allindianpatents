				<td>FAST CALL SETUP SYSTEM AND METHOD IN A MOBILE COMMUNICATIONS<br>
SYSTEM<br>
Technical Field<br><br>
The present invention relates to a mobile communications system and more particularly, to a call setup system and method in a mobile communications environment.<br>
Background Art<br>
In the world of cellular telecommunications, those skilled in the art often use the terms 1G, 2G, and 3G. The terms refer to the generation of the cellular technology used. 1G refers to the first generation, 2G to the second generation, and 3G to the third generation. 1G is used to refer to the analog phone system, known as an AMPS (Advanced Mobile Phone Service) phone systems. 2G is commonly used to refer to the digital cellular systems that are prevalent throughout the world, and include CDMAOr-e, Global System for Mobile communications (GSM), and Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA). 2G systems can support a greater number of users in a dense area than can 1G systems. 3G is commonly used to refer to the digital cellular systems currently being developed. Recently, third-generation (3G) CDMA communication systems have been proposed including proposals, such as cdma2000 and W-CDMA. These 3G communication systems are conceptually similar to each other with some significant differences. A cdma2000 system is a third-generation (3G) wideband, spread spectrum radio interface system which uses the enhanced service potential of CDMA technology to facilitate data<br>
capabilities, such as Internet and intranet access, multimedia applications, high-speed business transactions, and telemetry. The focus of cdma2000, as is that of other third-generation systems, is on network economy an:radio transmission design to overcome the limitations of a finite amount of radio spectrum availability-<br>
FIG. 1 illustrates a wireless communication network 1 architecture.<br>
Referring to FIG. 1, a subscriber uses a mobile terminal 2 to access network services. The<br>
mobile terminal may be a portable communicati:" 5 unit, such as a hand-held cellular phone,<br>
a communication unit installed in a vehicle, or e.en. a fixed-location communications unit.<br>
The electromagnetic waves from the mobile terminal are transmitted by the Base Transceiver<br>
System (BTS) 3 also known as node B. The BTS 3 consists of radio devices such as<br>
antennas and equipment for transmitting radio waves. The Base Station Controller (BSC) 4<br>
receives the transmissions from one or more BTS's. The BSC 4 provides control and<br>
management of the radio transmissions from each BTS 3 by exchanging messages with the<br>
BTS 3 and the Mobile Switching Center (MSC) 5 or Internal IP Network 17. The BTS's and<br>
BSC are part of the Base Station (BS) 6.<br>
The BS 5 exchanges messages with and transmits data to a Circuit Switched Core Network<br>
(CSC.N) 7 and Packet Switched Core Network (PSCN) 8. The CSCN 7 provides traditional<br>
voice communications and the PSCN 8 provides Internet applications and multimedia<br>
services.<br>
The Mobile Switching Center (MSC) 5 portion of the CSCN 7 provides switching for traditional<br>
voice communications to and from an mobile terminal and may store information to support<br>
these capabilities. The MSC 5 may be connected to one of more BS's as well as other public<br>
networks, for example a Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) or Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN). A Visitor Location Register (VLR) 9 is used to retrieve information for handling voice communications to or from a visiting subscriber. The VLR 9 may be within the MSC and may serve more than one MSC 5.<br>
A user identity is assigned to the Home Location Register (HLR) 10 of the CSCN 7 for record purposes such as subscriber information, for example Electronic Serial Number (ESN), Mobile Directory Number (MDR), Profile Information, Current Location, and Authentication Period. The Authentication Center (AC) 11 manages authentication information related to the mobile terminal. The AC 11 may be within the HLR 10 and may serve more than one HLR 10. The interface between the SC and the HLR/AC is an IS-41 standard interface. The Packet Data Serving Node (PDSN) 12 portion of the PSCN 8 provides routing for packet data traffic to and from mobile terminal. The PDSN 12 establishes, maintains, and terminates link layer sessions to the mobile terminal's and may interface with one of more BS and one of_<br>
more PSCN.<br>
The Authentication, Authorization and Accounting (AAA) Server 13 provides Internet Protocol authentication, authorization and accounting functions related to packet data traffic. The Home Agent (HA) 14 provides authentication of MS IP registrations, redirects packet data to an from the Foreign Agent (FA) 15 component of the PDSN 12, and receives provisioning information for users from the AAA. The HA 14 may also establish, maintain, and terminate secure communications to the PDSN and assign a dynamic IP address. The PDSN 12 communicates with the AAA 13, HA 14 and the Internet 16 via an Internal IP Network 17. FIG. 2 illustrates a data link protocol architecture layer for a wireless network.<br>
Referring to FIG. 2, the upper layer contains three basis services; voice services 62, data services 61 and signaling 70. Voice services 62 include PSTN access, mobile-to-mobile voice services, and Internet telephony. Data services 61 are services that deliver any form of data on behalf of a mobile end user and include packet data applications (e.g., IP service), circuit data applications (e.g., asynchronous fax and B-ISDN emulation services), and SMS. Signaling 70 controls all aspects of mobile operation.<br>
The Link Layer 30, is subdivided into the Link Access Control (LAC) sublayer 32 and the Medium Access Control (MAC) sublayer 31. The link layer provides protocol support and control mechanisms for data transport services and performs the functions necessary to map the data transport needs of the upper levels 60 into specific capabilities and characteristics of the physical layer 20. The Link Layer 30 may be viewed as an interface between the upper layers and the Physical Layer 20.<br>
The separation of MAC 31 and LAC 32 sublayers is motivated by the need to support a wide range of upper layer services, and the requirement to provide for high efficiency and low latency data services over a wide performance range (from 1.2 Kbps to greater than 2 Mbps). Other motivators are the need for supporting high QoS delivery of circuit and packet data services, such as limitations on acceptable delays and/or data BER (bit error rate), and the growing demand for advanced multimedia services each service having a different QoS requirements.<br>
The LAC sublayer 32 is required to provide a reliable, in-sequence delivery transmission control function over a point-to-point radio transmission link 42.   The LAC sublayer manages<br>
point-to point communication channels between upper layer entities and provides framework to support a wide range of different end-to-end reliable link layer protocols. The MAC sublayer 31 facilitates complex multimedia,multi-services capabilities of 3G wireless systems with Quality of Service (QoS) management capabilities for each active service. The MAC sublayer 31 provides procedures for controlling the access of data services (packet and circuit) to the physical layer 20, including the contention control between multiple services from a single user, as well as between competing users in the wireless system. The MAC sublayer 31 also provides for reasonably reliable transmission over the radio link layer using a Radio Link Protocol (RLP) 33 for a best-effort level of reliability. Signaling Radio Burst Protocol (SRBP) 35 is an entity that provides connectionless protocol for signaling messages. Multiplexing and Quality of Service (QoS) Control 34 is responsible for enforcement of negotiated QoS levels by mediating conflicting requests from competing services and the appropriate prioritization of access requests.<br>
The Physical Layer 20 is responsible for coding and modulation of data transmitted over the air.   The Physical Layer 20 conditions digital data from the higher layers so that the data may be transmitted over a mobile radio channel reliably.<br>
The Physical Layer 20 maps user data and signaling, which are delivered by the MAC sublayer 31 over multiple transport channels, into a physical channels and transmits the information over the radio interface. In the transmit direction, the functions performed by the<br>
Physical Layer 20 include channel coding, interleaving, scrambling, spreading and modulation.<br>
| In the receive direction, the functions are reversed in order to recover the transmitted data at<br>
the receiver.<br>
Generally, a mobile terminal communicates traffic data through a synchronous channel. The mobile terminal receives overhead and paging messages for an incoming call over control channels. The mobile terminal then sends a response appropriate for the received page to a corresponding communications network.<br>
tr<br>
A base station transmits the overhead message or page on a common channel such as<br>
forward paging channel (F-PCH), forward broadcast control channel (F-BCCH), and forward<br>
common control channel (F-CCCH).  The overhead message is transmitted on F-PCH or F-<br>
BCCH and the paging is transmitted on F-PCH or F-CCCH.<br>
A mobile terminal, when turned on, monitors all slots to receive overhead messages.   After<br>
having received an overhead message, the mobile terminal can receive a page according to<br>
two kinds of modes.<br>
First mode is a non-slotted mode. In the non-slotted mode, the mobile terminal monitors all<br>
slots to receive a page. Second mode is slotted mode. In slotted mode, the mobile terminal is<br>
turned on at a determined slot to monitor the corresponding slot and to receive a page. The<br>
mobile terminal is then turned off in other slots to reduce power consumption.<br>
Whether the mobile terminal operates in non-slotted or slotted mode depends on a station<br>
class mask (SCM) value set in the mobile terminal. Generally, a mobile terminal is turned on one slot in advance of the determined slot in preparation of a paging reception. This is<br>
because preparation for hardware to normally operate is needed to receive a paging.<br>
When a mobile terminal operates in slotted mode, (i.e., when the mobile terminal receives a<br>
page in a specific slot to monitor a corresponding paging slot), the following two situations may arise!   First, if the value of the paging slot cycle increases, time during which the mobile<br>
terminal is turned on is decreased. This reduces power consumption, however, time taken for the mobile terminal to receive a page is prolonged and call setup is delayed.   Second, if<br>
the value of the paging slot cycle decreases, the time during which the mobile terminal is turned on is prolonged. This increases the power consumption of the mobile terminal. The time for the mobile terminal to receive the paging is reduced, however, because the time taken for setting up the call is shortened.<br>
A base station sets values of minimum slot cycle index (MIN_SLOT_CYCLE_INDEX) and maximum slot cycle index (MAX_SLOT_CYCLE_!NDEX). Accordingly, all mobile terminals in a service domain of a corresponding base station determine a paging slot cycle value using the values of minimum cycle index (MIN_SLOT_CYCLE_INDEX) and maximum slot cycle index (MAX_SLOT_CYCLE_INDEX).<br>
In the slotted mode, the mobile terminal is turned on once each predetermined cycle. Such a cycle is called a paging slot cycle. And, a corresponding slot monitored by the mobile terminal during the corresponding paging slot cycle is called a paging slot (PGSLOT). The paging slot cycle can be found by Equation 1. [Equation 1]: C = 16 x 21, -4 ≤i ≤7<br>
In Equation 1, "f is a selected slot cycle index (SLOT_CYCLE_INDEXS).  The selected slot<br>
cycle index (SLOT_CYCLE_INDEXS) is found by Equation 2 using three kinds of parameters,<br>
for example, preferred slot cycle index (SLOT_CYCLE_INDEXP), maximum slot cycle index<br>
(MAX_SLOT_CYCLEJNDEXS), and minimum slot cycle index (MIN_SLOT_CYCLE_INDEXS).<br>
[Equation      2]:	SLOT_CYCLE_INDEXs      =      MAX     (MIN_SLOT_CYCLE_INDEXS,<br>
MIN(SLOT_CYCLE_INDEXP, MAX_SLOT_CYCLEJINDEXS))<br>
The preferred slot cycle index (SLOT_CYCLE_INDEXP) is a value stored in the mobile terminal and has a preferred value of -^4 to 7. The value of the preferred siot cycle index (SLOT_CYCLE_!NDEXP) is transmitted "o a base station through one or two fields (SLOT_CYCLEJNDEX, SIGN_SLOT_CYCLEJNDEX) in registration message (RGM), Origination message (ORM), page response message (PRM), or terminal information message.<br>
The minimum slot cycle index (MIN_SLOT_CYCLE_INDEXS) has a preferred value of -4 to 0. The maximum slot cycle index (MAX_SLOT_CYCLE_INDEXS) has a preferred value of 0 to 7. The value of the maximum slot cycle index (MAX_SLOT_CYCLE_INDEXS) is transmitted to the mobile terminal from the base terminal through system parameters message (SPM) or MC-RR parameters message (MCRRPM).<br>
The paging slot (PGSLOT) is found by Hashing using a phone number of the mobile terminal. One corresponding value is selected from the group consisting of 0 to (C-1), where 'C' is the value of paging slot cycle calculated by Equation 1. FIG. 3 illustrates a case where the values of the preferred slot cycle index (SLOT_CYCLEJNDEXP), maximum slot cycle index (MAX_SLOT_CYCLEJNDEX$), minimum slot cycle index (MIN_SLOT_CYCLE_INDEXS), and paging slot (PGSLOT) are 2, -1, 3, and 6, respectively.<br>
Based on Equation 2, the value of the selected slot cycle index (SLOT_CYCLE_INDEXS) is "21. That is, the value of the selected slot cycle index (SLOT_CYCLE_INDEXS) is max[-1, min(2,3)J which is equal to '2'. Moreover, based on Equation 1, the paging slot cycle becomes 16 x 22, (i.e., '64' by applying the value '2' of the calculated slot cycle index<br><br>
(SLOT_CYCLE_INDEX$) to '1').<br>
lot numbers are repeated from 0 to 2047. Hence, as shown in FIG. 3, because the paging slot cycle is 64 and the paging slot (PGSLOT) is 6, the mobile terminal sequentially monitors the slot numbers 6, 70, 134, and 198.<br>
In the above-explained related art, if the mobile terminal, which previously had a data call that was released, subsequently tries'a call access the mobile terminal will have to wait for the duration of the entire cycle. It is necessary to set up separate parameter values to a specific mobile terminal to reduce a time delay for receiving a paging for the call access. This is because it is highly probable that the mobile terminal, which had setup the call that was released, will try to setup a call again.<br>
Currently, all mobile terminals that communicate with the same base station use the same values of the maximum slot cycle index (MAX_SLOT_CYCLE_INDEXS) and minimum slot cycle index (MIN_SLOT_CYCLE_INDEXS). Hence, when a particular mobile terminal tries to setup a call connection with the base station, the time taken for receiving the page from the base station is delayed. Therefore, a fast call setup method and system is needed. There is a higher probability that a mobile terminal, which recently had a call release, to setup a call again, compared with other mobile terminals attempting to setup a new call. In other words, there is a high probability that a page for connecting a call will be sent to the mobile terminal that has recently released the call.<br>

Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
To aid describing the present invention, certain exemplary parameter names, values, lengths and other attributes are being used to describe the channels, messages and fix or variable identifiers communicated between mobile and base stations. It should be noted that such parameter names are for illustration purposes only, and that other names may be used to describe the same or similar function.<br>
To accomplish this, the base station transmits the values of minimum cycle index (MIN_SLOT_CYCLEJNDEX) and maximum slot cycle index (MAX_SLOT_CYCLE_INDEX), and parameters enabling the mobile terminal to determine a paging slot cycle after call<br>
release (hereinafter named 'after-release paging slot cycle (paging_s!ot_cycle_re!ease)').

mobile terminal determines the after-release paging slot cycle (paging_slot_cycle_re!ease) based on the above parameter.<br>
The base station sets the above-listed parameters so that the mobile terminals can aajust a monitoring cycle of the paging slot. The base station then transmits the parameters to the corresponding mobile terminals, in one embodiment, the base station further transmits after-release cycle index (SLOT_CYCLE_INDEX_RELEASE) to the mobile terminal. The after-release cycle index (SLOT_CYCLE_INDEX_RELEASE) is transmitted to the mobile terminal through a release order (RO) (e.g., a message used in releasing a call of a mobile terminal), an enhanced release order (ERO), an extended release message (ERM), or an extended release mint message (ERMM).<br>
The mobile terminal, in another embodiment, further transmits a new parameter for informing a minimum slot cycle length that can be currently supported by the mobile terminal itself. Mobile terminal minimum slot cycle index (MIN_SLOT_CYCLEJNDEX_MS) is transmitted to the base station through one of release order (RO), extended release mini message (ERMM),<br>
•   and extended release response mini message (ERRMM).<br>
The after-release paging slotcycle (paging_slot_cycte_release) can be determined based on said parameter values. The base station, thus, considers the situation of the mobile terminals<br>
in its service domain as well as the current system situation to adjust the monitoring cycle cf the paging slot of the mobile terminal.<br>
In one' embodiment, the mobile terminal provides the base station with the capability cf monitoring the paging slot according to its situation. The base station further considers the current capability of the mobile terminal to determine a paging slot monitoring cycle. In one embodiment, the paging slot monitoring cycle is shorter than a previous paging s'c: monitoring cycle for the released call.<br>
In   one   embodiment   of   the   present   invention,   the   after-release   paging   slot   cycle (paging_slot_cycle_release) is determined by Equation 3 below. The after-release paging slot cycle (Paging_sioLcycie_release) is a paging slot monitoring cycle that will be used by the mobile terminal releasing a data call. [Equation 3]: CR = 16 x 2\ -4 ≤i ≤7<br>
In Equation 3, '1' is a slot cycle index selected after call release (hereinafter named 'after-release selected slot cycle index (SLOT_CYCLE_INDEX_RELEASES)'). The after-release selected slot cycle index (SLOT_CYCLE_lNDEX_RELT_CYCLEJNDEXA after-release maximum slot cycle index (MAX_SLOT_CYCLE_INDEASEs) is found by Equation 4 below using three parameters: preferred slot cycle index (SLOEX_RELEASES), and atter-release minimum slot cycle index (MIN_SLOT_CYCLEJNDEX_RELEASES). [Equation 4]: SLOT_CYCLEJNDEX_RELEASES =<br>
max[MIN_SLOT_CYCLEJNDEX_RELEASESl<br>
(SLOT_CYCLEJNDEXP,MAX_SLOT_CYCLE_INDEX_RELEASE3)]<br>
mm<br>
In one embodiment, if the after-release paging slot cycle (paging_slot_cycle_release) is<br>
continuously shortened  after  call  release.   power consumption  of the  mobile terminal<br>
increases. A limitation is associated with the eeerational time for the after-release paging slot<br>
cycle (paging_slot_cycle_release), based or ~ew parameters after-release -maximum slot cycle index (MAX_SLOT_CYCLE_INDEX_RE_HASES) and after-release minir.jrn slot cycle index (MIN_SLOT_CYCLE_INDEX_RELEASE: .<br>

To calculate the after-release paging slot cycle (paging_slot_cycle_release), the base station uses the mobile terminal minimum slot cycle index (M1N_SLOT_CYCLE_INDEX_MS) received from the mobile terminal and the after-release slot cycle index (SLOT_CYCLE-INDEX_RELEASE) in the base station.<br>
In another embodiment, in case of cs'.:..ating the after-release pac": slot cycle (paging_slot_cycle_release), the mobile terminal uses the after-release si cycle index (SLOT_CYCLE-INDEX_RELEASE) received from the base station and the mobile terminal minimum slot cycle index (MIN_SLOT_CYCLE_INDEX_MS) stored by the mobile terminal, according to Equation 5.<br>
[Equation 5\: SLOT_CYCLE_INDEX_RELEASE     =<br>
MAX [SLOT_CYCLE_INDEX_RELEASE, MIN(SLOT_CYCLE_INDEX_MS)] If the after-release paging slot cycle (paging_siot_cycle_release) is continually shortened after call release, power consumption of the mobile terminal increases.  However, there is a limitation associated with operational time of using the after-release paging slot cycle (paging__slot_cyc!e_release).<br>
In one embodiment, the base station further transmits after-release operational time information (SLOT__CYCLE__RELE-.SE_TIMER) for putting the limitation on the operational time using the after-release paging slot cycle (paging_slot_cycle_release) to the mobile terminal. The after-release operational time information (SLOT_CYCLE_RELEASE_J1MER) is transmitted to the mobile terminal through either the release order (RO), the enhanced release order (ERO), the extended release message (ERM), or the extended release mini message (ERMM), for example.<br>
Upon receiving the after-release operational time information (SLOT_CYCLE_RELEASE_TIMER), the mobile terminal uses the shortened paging slot cycle, i.e., after-release paging slot cycle (paging_slot_cyc!e_release), until an operational timer expires after the call release. The mobile terminal then uses the value of the minimum slot cycle index (MIN_SLOT_CYCLE_'.NDEX) and the default paging slot cycle determined using the maximum slot cycle index (MAX_SLOT_CYCLE_INDEX) after the operational timer expires. The default paging slot cycle is a cycle used in the previously established call, for example.<br>
In one embodiment, the mobile terminal determines an operation timer value by Equation 6<br>
below	using	the	after-release	operational	time	information<br>
(SLOT_CYCLE_REIEASE_TIMER).    ' [Equation 6]: TIMER = 16 x 2', wherein i = SLOT_CYCLE_RELEASE_TIMER<br><br>
In     determining     a    value    of    the    after-release     operational     time     information (SLOT_CYCLE_RELEASE_TIMER), the base station sets a corresponding information value -to      be      greater      than      the      after-release      maximum      slot      cycle       index (MAX_SLOT_CYCLEJNDEX_RELEASE).<br>
In one embodiment, if the value of the after-release operational time information (SIOT_CYCLE_RELEASE_TIMER) is '0', the operational timer can be set to  (infinity). In such a case, the mobile terminal keeps using the after-release paging slot cycle (paging_slot__cycle_release) as a cycle after the call release to monitor the paging slot. Explained in the following are examples that the base station transmits new parameters (MIN_SLOT_CYCLE_INDEX_RELEASE, MAX_SLOT_CYCLEJNDEX_RELEASE) and the after-release operational time information (SLOT_CYCLE_RELEASE_TIMER), which are used in determining the after-release paging slot cycle (paging_slot__cycle_telease) after the cai! release, to the mobile terminal.<br>
A base station preferably transmits parameters (MIN_SLOT_CYCLEJNDEX_RELEASE, MAX_SLOT_CYCLEJNDEX_RELEASE, SLOT_CYCLE_RELEASE_TIMER), which are used in determining the after-release paging slot cycle (paging_s!ot_cycle_refease) after call release, to a mobile terminal through one of system parameters message (SPM), MC-RR<br>
parameters message (MCRRPM), or in-traffic system parameters message (ITSPM), for<br>
example.<br>
The mobile terminal receives and stores the parameters. The mobile terminal, after releasing a call, determines the after-release paging slot cycle (paging_slot_cycle_release) using the<br><br>
stored parameters. The mobile terminal monitors the paging slot by the determined after-<br>
release paging slot cycle (paging_slot_cycie_release) as a cycle until the operational timer<br>
determined by the after-release	operational time	information<br>
(SLOT_CYCLE_RELEASE_TIMER) expires.<br>
Referring to FIG. 4, three bits are preferably used for each of the after-release maximum slot cycle index (MAX_SLOT_CYCLE_INDEX_RELEASE) and the after-release minimum slot cycle index (MIN_SLOT_CYCIE_INDEX_RELEASE)), and eight bits are used for the after-release operational time information (SLOT_CYCLE_RELEASE_TIMER). As such, a base station transmits to mobile terminal parameters used in determining the after-release paging slot cycle. The mobile terminal receives and stores the parameters and determines the after-release paging slot cycle based on the received parameters. The mobile terminal monitors the paging slot by the determined after-release paging slot cycle as a cycle until the operational timer determined by the after-release operational time information expires.<br>
The mobile terminal monitors the paging slot to receive a paging from the base station. In one embodiment, the each message for RO, ERO, ERM, and ERMM has the format shown; in FIG. 4, for example. Explained in the following is an exemplary process for determining after-release paging slot cycle for a fast call setup.<br>
If values of the preferred slot cycle index (SLOT_CYCLEJNDEXP), minimum slot cycle<br>
index	(MIN_SLOT_CYCLE_INDEXS),         maximum	slot	cycle	index<br>
(MAX_SLOT_CYCLEJNDEX.),       after-release       minimum        slot       cycle        index {M1N_SLOT_CYCLEJNDEX_RELEASES)1  and  after-release   maximum  slot  cycle   index (MAX_SLOT_CYCLEJNDE\_REi_EASEs) are 3, -1, 2, -1, and 1, respectively, the selected slot cycle index (SLOT_CYCLE_INDEXS) used in determining the paging slot cycis of the . default used before the call of the mobile terminal is connected becomes '2' based or rna.x[-1, min{2,3)] by inserting the respective values 3, -1, and 2 in Equation 2 for example. Under the normal slotted mode, the paging slot cycle becomes 16 x 22, i.e., '64' by applying the value '2' of the calculated selected slot cycle index (SLOT_CYCLE_INDEXS) to T of Equation 1.<br>
Under   the    reduced    slotted   mode,    the   after-release   selected    slot    cycle    index (SLOT_CYCLE_INDEX_RELEASES), which is used in determining the after-release paging slot cycle (paging_slot_cycle_release) used after the connected call has been released, becomes max[-1, min(3,1)] = 1 by inserting the respective-values of the preferred slot cycle index       (SLOT_CYCLEJNDEXP),      after-release      minimum      slot      cycle       index (MIN_SLOT_CYCLEJNDEX_RELEASE,})   and  after-release   maximum   siot   cycle   index (MAX_SLOT_CYCLE_INDEX_RELEASES) in Equation 4, for example. For example, the paging slot cycle becomes 16 x 21, i.e., '32' by applying the value T of the calculated after-release selected slot cycle index (SLOT_CYCLE_INDEX_RE_EASE= to T of Equation 1.  The mobile terminal, as khown in FIG. 3, monitors the paging slot each 5- slots before the call is connected. Howwever, after the call is released, the mobile terminal, as<br>
shown in FIG. 5, monitors the paging slot each 32 slots until the operational timer determined         by         the         after-release         operational         time         information (SLOT_CYCLE_RELEASE__TIMER) expires. FIG. 5 is a diagram of a process of calculating an after-release selected slot cycle index value<br>
and an after-release paging slot cycle (paging_s!ot__cyc)e_release) value and determining a slot to be monitored from the calculated values according to the present invention, in which a mobile terminal monitors a paging slot each 32 slots in case of receiving a paging in slotted mode, if values of the paging slot (PGSLOT) found by Hashing using a phone number of the mobile terminal, preferred slot cycle index (SLOT_CYCLE_INDEXP), after-release minimum slot cycle index (MIN_SLOT_CYCLE_INDEX_RELEASES), and after-release maximum slot cycle index (MAX_SLOT_CYCLE_iNDEX_RELEASEs) are 6, 3, -1, and 1, respectively. The value of the paging slot (PGSLOT) is determined as one of 0 to (C-1), where 'C' is a value of the paging slot cycle calculated by Equation 3. When the number of the paging slot is repeated from 0 to 2047, the paging slot cycle, as shown in FIG. 5, is 32 and the paging slot (PGSLOT) is 6, for example.   Hence, the mobile terminal sequentially monitors the slot numbers 6, (6+32), (6+32+32), (6+32+32+32), etc..<br>
FIG. 6 and FIG. 7 are diagrams of a message format for transmitting parameters used in determining an after-release paging slot cycle (paging_slot__cycle_release) according to the present invention. FIG. 6 illustrates an exemplary message format for the release order (RO), the enhanced release order (ERO), the extended release message (ERM), or the extended release mini message (ERMM). FIG. 7 illustrates an exemplary message format for the<br>
release order (RO), the extended release mini message (ERMM), or the extended release<br>
response mini message (ERRMM).   Other messages may also be used to transmit the parameters noted above without deviating the gist of the present invention. Referring to FIG. 6, in order to support the present invention, the new fields or parameters for the after-release slot cycle index (SLOT_CYCLE_INDEX_REI_EASE) and the after-release operational time information (SLOT_CYCLE_RELEASE_TIMER) are added to the message format illustrated (e.g., RO, ERO, ERM, ERMM). A field for the mobile terminal minimum slot cycle index (MIN_SLOT_CYCLE_INDEX_MS) is included to the message format in FIG. 7. In the following are examples of new parameters, i.e., the mobile terminal minimum slot cycle index (MIN_SLOT_CYCLE_INDEX_MS), the after-release slot cycle index (SLOT_CYCLE_INDEX_RELEASE), and the after-release operational time information (SLOT_CYCLE_RELEASE_TIMER), which are used in determining the after-release paging slot cycle (paging_slot_cycle_release) after the call release, are transferred between the base station and the mobile terminal. Besides, an example that the mobile terminal or base station uses the normal slotted mode order is explained as well.<br>
Referring to FIGS. 8 to 13, the mobile terminal of the present invention sends the mobile terminal minimum slot cycle index (MIN_SI_OT_CYCLE_!NDEX_MS) to inform the base station of a minimum slot cycle length that the mobile terminal itself can currently support. The base station transfers the after-release slot cycle index (SLOT_CYCLEJNDEX_RELEASE) and the after-release operational time information (SLOT_CYCLE_RELEASE_TIMER) to a mobile terminal with a released call to set the paging slot cycle length of the corresponding mobile terminal to be shorter. As shown in FIGS. 11 to<br>
13, the mobile terminal minimum slot cycle index (MIN_SLOT_CYCLE_INDEX_MS) may be<br>
transmitted to the base station after the after-release slot cycle index (SLOT_CYCLE_INDEX_RELEASE) and the after-release operational time information (SLOT_CYCLE_RELEASE_T1MER) have been transmitted.<br>
In the following description, the after-release selected slot cycle index (SLO7_CYCLE_INDEX_RELEASES) calculated by Equation 5 is called 'reduced slot cycle index'. A mode which utilizes the after-release paging slot cycle (paging_slot_cycle_release)' calculated by Equation 3 using the reduced slot cycle index, is called 'reduced slotted mode'. The mobile terminal operating in the reduced slotted mode monitors the paging slot by a shorter cycle.<br>
In one embodiment of the present invention, if the operational timer expires or the normal slotted mode order is used, the mobile terminal stops operating in the reduced slotted mode and then operates in the normal slotted mode.<br>
During the normal slotted mode, the mobile terminal determines the paging slot cycle value using the values of the minimum and maximum slot cycle indexes (MIN_SLOT_CYCLEJNDEX, MAX_SLOT_CYCLEJNDEX) equal to those of other mobile terminals belonging to the base station, and then monitors the paging slot using the determined value as a cycle.<br>
Referring to FIG. 8, the mobile terminal is transmitting/receiving data to/from the base station as a data call is connected. Such data or signal traffic is transmitted/received using a traffic channel formed between the mobile terminal and the base station.<br>
Referring to FIG. 8, in case of requesting a call release by the mobile terminal, the mobile terminal preferably transmits the release order message (RO) to the base station to request<br>
the call release. In this case, the mobile 'terminal includes a parameter (MIN_SLOT_CYCLEJNDEX_MS) indicating a minimum slot cyde length currently supportable by the mobile terminal to the release order message (RO) and then transmits the release order mess3ge (RO) to the base station (S1).<br>
Upon receiving the release order'message (RO) from the mobile terminal, the base station transmits a counterpart (or reply) release order message (RO) for allowing the call release to the mobile terminal. In this case, the base station includes the parameters associated with the after-release paging slot cycle (paging_slot_cycle_release) in the release order message (RO) sent to the mobile terminal. One such parameter comprises a field-(SLOT_CYCLE_lNDEX_RELEASE).<br>
Preferably, the base station also includes (SLOT_CYCLE_INDEX_RELEASE_TlMER) to the release order message (RO) and transmits to the mobile terminal (S2). That is. the base station transfers the new parameter 'SLOT_CYCLE_INDEX_RELEASE' to be used in determining the after-release paging slot cycle (paging_slot_cyclejrelease) and another new parameter 'SLOT_CYCLE_INDEX_RELEASE_TIMER' to be used in limiting the operational time using the after-release paging slot cycle (paging_slot_cycle_release)- to the mobile tormina! through the release order message (RO).<br>
The mobile terminal having received the release order message (RO) from the base station calculates the reduced slot cycle index based on Equation 5, and then calculates the after-release paging slot cycle (paging_slot_cycle_release) using the calculated reduced slot cycle index as a value of T in Equation 3. Consequently, the mobile terminal operates in the<br>
reduced slotted mode for monitoring the paging with the after-release paging slot cycle (paging_slot_cycle_release) calculated using the reduced slot cycle index. In one embodiment, the mobile terminal monitors the paging slot for a page using the calculated after-release paging slot cycle (paging_slot_cycle_release) as a slot cycle until the operation    timer    determined    by    the    after-release    operational    time    information<br>
(SLOT_CYCLE_RELEASE_TIMER) expires.<br>
If the operational timer expires later, the mobile terminal determines the paging slot cycle<br>
value    using   the    values    of   the    minimum    and    maximum    slot    cycle    indexes<br>
(MiN_SLOT_CYCLE_INDEX, MAX_SLOT_CYCLE_INDEX) equal to those of other mobile<br>
terminals in the base station, and operates in the normal slotted mode for monitoring the<br>
paging signal. The mobile terminal monitors the paging slot by taking the paging slot cycle<br>
calculated using Equation 1 and Equation 2 as a cycle, for example.<br>
FIG. 9 illustrates an embodiment wherein the normal slotted mode is requested by the mobile<br>
terminal and is entered prior to the expiration of the reduced slotted mode. The procedure for<br>
entering the reduced slotted mode is similar to that shown in FIG. 8, and thus will not be<br>
repeated here.<br>
According to FIG. 9, the mobile terminal having received the release order message (RO)<br>
from the base station calculates the reduced slot cycle index using Equation 5, and then<br>
calculates   the   after-release   paging   slot  cycle   (paging_s!ot_cycle_release)   using   the<br>
calculated reduced slot cycle index as a value of 7 in Equation 3.<br>
The mobile terminal operates in the reduced slotted modje for monitoring the paging signal<br>
with the after-release paging slot cycle (paging_slot_cycle_re!ease) calculated using the<br>
reduced slot cycle index. If the mobile terminal transmits the normal slotted mode order to stop the operation of the reduced slotted mode before expiration of the operational timer, the operating timer is disabled (S12), and the normal slotted mode is entered by the mobile terminal and the base station.<br>
Upon entering the normal slotted mode, the mobile terminal monitors the paging by the paging slot cycle calculated using the values of the minimum and maximum slot cycle indexes (MIN__SLOT_CYCLE_INDEX, MAX_SLOT_CYCLE_INDEX) equal to those of other mobile terminals in the base station.<br>
FIG. 10 illustrates an embodiment wherein the normal slotted mode is requested by the base station and is entered prior to the expiration of the reduced slotted mode. The procedure for entering the reduced slotted mode is similar to that shown in FIG. 8, and thus will not be repeated here.<br>
According to FIG. 10, the mobile terminal having received the release order message (RO) from the base station calculates the reduced slot cycle index using Equation 5, and then calculates the after-release paging slot cycle (paging_slot_cycte_re1ease) using the calculated reduced slot cycle index as a value of T in Equation 3.<br>
The mobile terminal operates in the reduced slotted mode for monitoring the paging signal with the after-release paging slot cycle (paging_slot_cycle_release) calculated using the reduced slot cycle index. If the base station transmits the normal slotted mode order to stop the operation of the reduced slotted mode before expiration of the operational timer, the operating timer is disabled (S12), and the normal slotted mode is entered by the mobile<br>
terminal and the base station.<br>
Upon entering the normal slotted mode, the mobile terminal monitors the paging by the paging slot cycle calculated using the values of the minimum and maximum slot cycle indexes (MIN_SLOT_CYCLE_INDEX, MAX_SLQT_CYCLE_INDEX) equal to those of other mobile terminals in the base station.<br>
Referring to FIG. 11, when requesting a call release by the base station, the base station preferably requests the cat; release by tianamiui^g o.'e of the release order message (RO), enhanced release order message (ERO), extended re.'aase message (ERM), and extended release mini message (ERMM). The base station includes the parameters associated with the after-release paging slot cycle (paging_slot_cycle_reiease) in the RO, ERO, ERM, or ERMM message sent to the mobile terminal. One such parameter comprises a field (SLOT_CYGLE_INDEX_RELEASE).<br>
Preferably, the base station also includes (SLOT_CYCLE_INDEX_RELEASE_TSMER) to the RO, ERO, ERM, or ERMM message and transmits tc the mobile terminal (S30). That is, the base station transfers the new parameter <slot_cycle_index_release to be used in determining the after-release paging slot cycle and another new parameter limiting operational time using mobile terminal through ro ero erm or ermm message.></slot_cycle_index_release>
Having received the message (one of the RO, ERO, ERM, and ERMM) requesting the call release, the mobile terminal transmits one of release order message (RO), extended release response message (ERRM), on extended release response mini message (ERRMM), for example, to allow the call release. The mobile terminal preferably includes a parameter<br>
(MiN_SLOT__CYCLE_INDEX_MS)   indicating   a   minimum   slot   cycle   length   currently supportable by tne mobile terminal in one of the RO, ERRM, ERRMM used for allowing the<br>
call release and then transmits the corresponding message to the base station (S31). Having transmitted the release message (e.g., one of RO, ERRM, ERRMM), the mobile terminal calculates the reduced slot cycle index using Equation 5, and then calculates the after-release paging slot cycle paging_slot__cyc!e_release) using the calculated reduced slot cycle index as a value of T in Equation 3.  In one embodiment, the mobile terminal operates in the reduced slotted mode for monitoring the paging with the after-release paging slot cycle (paging_slot_cycle_/elease) calculated using the reduced slot cycle index.    The mobile terminal   monitors   the  paging   slot  by  the  calculated   after-release   paging  slot   cycle (paging_slot_cycle__re!ease) as a cycle until the operation timer determined by the after-release operational time information {SLOT_CYCLE_RELEASE_TlMER) expires. The mobile terminal monitors the paging slot to receive the paging.<br>
If the operational timer expires later, the mobile terminal determines the paging slot cycle, value using the values of the minimum and maximum slot cycle indexes (MIN_SLOT_CYCLEJNDEX. ?.<ax_slot_cyclejndex equal to those of other mobile terminals in the base station and operates normal slotted mode for monitoring paging signal. terminal monitors slot by taking cycle calculated using equation as a example.></ax_slot_cyclejndex>
FIG. 12 illustrates an embodiment wherein the normal slotted mode is requested by the mobile terminal and is entered prior to the expiration of the reduced slotted mode.   The<br>
procedure for entering the reduced slotted mode is similar to that shown in FIG. 11, and thus will no: be repeated here.<br>
According to FIG. 12, the mobile terminal having transmitted the message (one of RO, ERRM, or ERRMM) allowing the call release (S41), the mobile terminal calculates the reduced slot cycle 'ndex using Equation 5, and then calculates the after-release paging slot cycle (paging_slot_cycle_release) using the calculated reduced slot cycle index as a value of T in Equation 3.<br>
The mobile terminal operates in the reduced slotted mode for monitoring the paging with the after-release paging slot cycle (paging_slot_cycle_release) calculated using the reduced slot cycle index. If the mobile terminal transmits the normal slotted mode order to stop the operation of the reduced slotted mode before expiration of the operational timer, the operating timer is disabled (S42), and the normal slotted mode is entered by the mobile terminal and the base station.<br>
Upon entering the normal slotted mode, the mobile terminal monitors the paging by the paging slot cycle calculated using the values of the minimum and maximum slot cycle indexes (MIN_SLOT_CYCLE_INDEX, MAX_SLOT_CYCLEJNDEX) equal to those of other mobile terminals in trie base station.<br>
FIG. 13 illustrates an embodiment wherein the normal slotted mode is requested by the base station and is entered prior to the expiration of the reduced slotted mode. The procedure for entering the reduced slotted mode is similar to that shown in FIG. 11, and thus will not be repeated here.<br>
According to FIG. 13, the mobile terminal having transmitted the message (one of RO,<br>
ERRM, or ERRMM) allowing the call release (S51), the mobile terminal calculates the<br>
reduced slot cycle index using Equation 5, and then calculates the after-release paging slot<br>
cycle (paging_slot_cycle_re!ease) using the calculated reduced slot cycle index as a value of<br>
T in Equation 3.	. .<br>
The mobile terminal operates in the reduced slotted mode for monitoring the paging with the after-release paging slot cycle (paging_slot_cycle_release) calculated using the reduced slot cycle index. If the base station transmits the normal slotted mode order to stop the operation of the reduced slotted mode before expiration of the operational timer, the operating timer is disabled (S52), and the normal slotted mode is entered by the mobile terminal and the base station.<br>
Upon entering the normal slotted mode, the mobile terminal monitors the paging by the paging slot cycle calculated using the values of the minimum and maximum slot cycle indexes (MIN_SLOT_CYCLE_INDEX, MAX_SLOT_CYCLE_INDEX) equal to those of other mobile terminals in the base station.<br>
FIG. 14 illustrates an example where the reduced paging slot cycle is 8. For example, if values of the preferred slot cycle index (SLOT_CYCLE_INDEXP), minimum slot cycle index (MiN_SLOT_CYCLE_INDEXs), maximum slot cycle index (MAX_SLOT_CYCLE_INDEXS), after-release slot cycle index provided by the base station (SLOT_CYCLE_INDEX_RELEASE), and mobile terminal minimum slot cycle index (MIN_SLOT_CYCLE_INDEX_MS) are 3, -1, 2, -1 and -3, respectively, the selected slot cycle index (SLOT_CYCLEJNDEXS) used in determining the paging slot cycfe of the default used<br>
before the call of the mobile terminal is connected becomes '2' based on max[2, min(3,-1)j by inserting the respective values 3, -1, and 2.<br>
The paging slot cycle becomes 16 x 22, i.e., '64' by applying the value '2' of the calculated selected slot cycle index (SLOT_CYCLE_INDEXS) to T of Equation 1.   The after-release selected slot cycle index (SLOT_CYCLE_INDEX_RELEASES), which is used in determining the after-release paging slot cycle (paging_slot_cycle_release) used after the connected call has been released, becomes max(-1,-3)] = -1 by inserting the respective values, -1 and -3 of the after-release slot cycle index (SLOT_CYCLE_INDEX_RELEASE) and mobile terminal minimum slot cycle index (MIN_SLOT_CYCLE_INDEX_MS) in Equation 5. The paging slot cycle becomes 16 x 2\ i.e., '8' by applying the value '-1' of the calculated after-release selected slot cycle index (SLOT_CYCLE_INDEX_RELEASE5) to T of Equation 3. The mobile terminal, as shown in FIG. 3, monitors the paging slot, every 64 slots before the call is released. After the call is released, the mobile terminal, as shown in FIG. 14, monitors the paging slot every 8 slots.until the operational timer determined by the after-release operational time information (SLOT_CYCLE_RELEASE_TIMER) expires. Although the above descriptions provide how the present invention is practiced after a call is released, the present invention may also be used when the mobile terminal is in an idle state. In other words, the reduced slot cycle mode may be used even when there was no established traffic channel between the mobile terminal and the base station. During the idle mode, the reduced slot cycle mode may be initiated by either the base station or the mobile terminal. When it is the'base station initiated reduced slot cycle mode, the base station preferably uses a forward cLmmon signaling logical channel, preferably a mode transition order (MTO) message, that contains the slot cycle index (SLOT_CYCIEJNDEX_RELEASE} and the operational time information (SLOT_CYCLE_REL£ASE_T(MER). In response, the mobile terminal, preferably using a reverse common signaling logical channel, transmits the mobile terminal minimum slot cycle index (MIN_SLOT_CYCLE_INDEX_MS) to the base station. Using the above parameters during the idle mode, the mobile terminal and ths base station enter the reduced slot cycle mode as described with respect to FIGS. 8 to 13.<br>
Accordingly, in the present invention, the base station provides a specific mobile terminal with additional parameters to set a length of the paging slot cycle to be shorter than that of other mobile terminals, whereby the time delay taken for the call-released mobile terminal to receive the paging for resetting a call is reduced. Therefore, the present invention enables the fast call setup.<br>
The present invention allows the reduced slotted mode for monitoring the paging from the<br>
base station to improve the overall system performance.  If operation in the reduced slotted<br>
mode is unnecessary before the expiration of the operational time corresponding to the<br>
reduced slotted mode, the normal slotted mode order is used to improve the performance of<br>
the base station system.<br>
