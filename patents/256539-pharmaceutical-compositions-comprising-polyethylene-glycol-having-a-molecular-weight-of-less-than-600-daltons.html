				<td>PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOSITIONS COMPRISING POLYETHYLENE 6LYCOL HAVING A MOLECULAR<br>
WEIGHT OF LESS THAN 600 DALTONS<br>
The present invention relates to liquid pharmaceutical compositions, in particular to depot formulations comprising a pharmaceutically active agent and to a process for preparing said depot formulations.<br>
Depot formulations are typically administered parenterally. The active agent in liquid form may be administered by injection subcutaneously or intramuscularly through a small gauge needle or placed into accessible tissue sites through a cannula. However parenteral administration may be very painful especially if repeated injections are necessary. Furthermore, there may be difficulties with depot formulations which are administered in liquid form comprising more than 50 % of an organic solvent and which form a solid implant in the body after injection. Often the solidifying process starts in the syringe before Injection and causes needle clogging. Depot formulations which form implants after injection may comprise a polymer or a mixture of polymers. These polymers have to be dissolved in an organic solvent. If the organic solvent remains in the solution forlnjection it might cause severe tissue irritation or necrosis at the site of implantation.<br>
A variety of approaches have been developed to provide processes for preparing depot formulations. However these processes are often very complex comprising many different steps. Several processes include a heating step which might cause severe stability problems, e.g. of the excipients of the depot formulation such as polymers.<br>
There is a need to provide improved depot formulations and simplified processes to prepare said depot formulations to overcome the above mentioned difficulties.<br>
Surprisingly it has been found that advantageous parenteral depot formulations with a biodegradable polymer may be obtained if the composition comprises polyethylene glycol (PEG) with a molecular weight of less than 600 Daltons and less than about 0.5% of any other organic solvent.<br>
The present invention provides in one aspect a liquid composition comprising"<br>
(a)	a biodegradable polymer,<br>
(b)	a polyethylene glycol having a molecular weight of less than 600 Daltons,<br>
(c)	a pharmaceutically active agent, and<br>
(d)	less than about 0.5% of a pharmaceutically acceptable solvent, and optionally<br>
(e)	an additive<br>
The composition of the invention may be stored e.g. in prefillcd syringe over an extended period of time without precipitation. Further, the compositions of the invention are well tolerated, e.g. may show only negligible irritating, necrotic or toxic effects.<br>
The depot formulations of the present invention are adapted to release all or substantially all the active agent over an extended period of time.<br>
In another'aspect the invention provides a process for preparing a depot formulation comprising the steps:<br>
(i)       dissolving a biodegradable polymer in a pharmaceutically acceptable organic<br>
solvent<br>
(ii)      optionally adding an additive to the polymer/solvent solution of step (i) (iii)      dissolving a pharmaceutically active agent in polyethylene glycol with a molecular<br>
weight of less than 600 Daltons (iv)      mixing solution (i) and (iii) or (ii) and (iii) (v)      removing the pharmaceutically acceptable organic solvent from the mixture e.g.<br>
by stirring and N2 urging under reduced pressure or by tangential cross-flow<br>
filtration to afford dia-filtration.<br>
In a further aspect the invention provides a process for preparing a depot formulation comprising the steps:<br>
(i)       dissolving a biodegradable polymer in a pharmaceutically acceptable organic solvent<br>
(ii)      optionally mixing an additive with polyethylene glycol with a molecular weight of<br>
less than 600 Daltons. (ill)      dissolving a pharmaceutically active agent in polyethylene glycol with a molecular<br>
weight of less than 600 Daltons or in the polyethylene glycol/additive mixture of<br>
step (ii)<br>
(iv)      mixing solution (i) and (iii) (v)      removing the pharmaceuticaily acceptable organic solvent from the mixture e.g by<br>
stirring and N2 urging under reduced pressure or by tangential cross-flow filtration<br>
to afford dia-filtration.<br>
According to the invention, a pharmaceutically acceptable, organic solvent is used to dissolve the biodegradable polymer but this solvent is removed at the end of the process. The resulting compositions of the invention contain only minor amounts of organic solvent, e.g. irritating solvent, e.g. less than 0.5 % by weight based on the total weight of the composition.<br>
The polymer of the composition of the invention may be a synthetic or a natural polymer. The polymer may be either a biodegradable or non-biodegradable or a combination of biodegradable and non-biodegradable polymers, preferably a biodegradable polymer may be used.<br>
By "polymer" is meant a homopolymer or a copolymer.<br>
As used herein, "biodegradable" means a material that should degrade by bodily processes to products readily disposable by the body and should not accumulate in the body.<br>
Suitable polymers include<br>
(a)	linear or branched polyesters which are linear chains radiating from a polyol moiety,<br>
e.g. glucose,<br>
(b)	polyesters such as D-, U- or racemic polylactic acid, polyglycolic acid, polyhydroxy-<br>
butyric acid, polycaprolactone, polyalkylene oxalate, polyalkylene glycol esters of acids<br>
of the Kreb's cycle, e.g. citric acid cycle, and the like and combinations thereofT<br>
(c)	polymers of organic ethers, anhydrides, amides, and orthoesters,<br>

The polymers may be cross-linked or non-cross-linked. Usually not more than 5%, typically less than 1% are cross-linked.<br>
The preferred polymers of this invention are linear polyesters, and branched chain polyesters. The linear polyesters may be prepared from the a-hydroxy carboxylic acids, e.g. lactic acid and glycolic acid, by condensation of the lactone dimers, see e.g. US 3,773,919, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference. The preferred polyester chains in the linear or branched (star) polymers are copolymers of the a-carboxylic acid moieties, lactic acid and glycolic acid, or of the lactone dimers. The molar ratios of lactide: glycolide of polylactide-co-glycolides preferably used according to the invention is preferably from about 95:5 to 5:95, e.g. 75:25 to 25:75, e.g. 60:40 to 40:60, with from 55:45 to 45:55, e.g. 52:48 to 48:52, e.g. 50:50.<br>

Typically 0.2% glucose is used to initiate polymerization. The branched polyesters (Glu-PLG) have a central glucose moiety having rays of linear polylactide chains, e.g. they have a star shaped structure.<br>
The branched polyesters having a central glucose moiety having rays of linear polylactide-co-glycolide chains (Glu-PLG) may be prepared by reacting a polyol with a lactide and<br>
preferably also a glycolide at an elevated temperature in the presence of a" catalyst, which makes a ring opening polymerization feasible.<br>

The compositions of the invention are useful for treatment of the known indications of the particular active agent incorporated in the polymer. Compositions of the invention comprising a somatostatin anologue may be useful in the following indications:<br>
a)	for the prevention or treatment of disorders with an aetiology comprising or associated<br>
with excess GH-secretion and/or excess of IGF-1 e.g. in the treatment of acromegaly as<br>
well as in the treatment of type I or type II diabetes mellitus, especially complications<br>
thereof, e.g. angiopathy, diabetic proliferative retinopathy, diabetic macular edema,<br>
nephropathy, neuropathy and dawn phenomenon, and other metabolic disorders related<br>
to insulin or glucagon release, e.g. obesity, e.g. morbid obesity or hypothalamic or<br>
hyperinsulinemic obesity, '<br>
b)	in the treatment of enterocutaneous and pancreaticocutaneous fistula, irritable bowel<br>
syndrom, inflammatory diseases, e.g. Grave's Disease, inflammatory bowel disease,<br>
psoriasis or rheumatoid arthritis, polycystic kidney disease, dumping syndrom, watery<br>
diarrhea syndrom, AIDS-related diarrhea, chemotherapy-induced diarrhea, acute or<br>
chronic pancreatitis and gastrointestinal hormone secreting tumors (e.g. GEP tumors, for<br>
example vipomas, glucagonomas, insulinomas, carcinoids and the like), lymphocyte<br>
malignancies, e.g. lymphomas or leukemias, hepatocellular carcinoma as well as<br>

c)	for the prevention or treatment of angiogenesis, inflammatory disorders as indicated<br>
above including inflammatory eye diseases, macular edema, e.g. cystoid macular<br>
edema, idiopathic cystoid macular edema, exudative age-related macular degeneration,<br>
choroidal neovascularization related disorders and proliferative retinopathy,<br>
d)	for preventing or combating graft vessel diseases, e.g. allo- or xenotransplant vasculo-<br>
pathies, e.g. graft vessel atherosclerosis, e.g. in a transplant of organ, e.g. heart, lung,<br>
combined heart-lung, liver, kidney or pancreatic transplants, or for preventing or treating<br>
vein graft stenosis, restenosis and/or vascular occlusion following vascular injury, e.g.<br>
caused  by   catherization   procedures  or  vascular  scraping   procedures   such   as<br>
percutaneous transluminal angioplasty, laser treatment or other Invasive procedures which disrupt the integrity of the vascular intima or endothelium,<br>
e) for treating somatostatin receptor expressing or accumulating tumors such as pituitary tumors, e.g. Cushing's Disease, gastro-enteropancreatic, carcinoids, central nervous system, breast, prostatic (including advanced hormone-refractory prostate cancer), ovarian or colonic tumors, small cell lung cancer, malignant bowel obstruction, paragangliomas, kidney cancer, skin cancer, neuroblastomas, pheochromocytomas, medullary thyroid carcinomas, myelomas, lymphomas, Hodgkins and non-Hodgkins lymphomas, bone tumours and metastases thereof, as well as autoimmune or inflammatory disorders, e.g. rheumatoid arthritis, Graves disease or other inflammatory eye diseases.<br>
Preferably, the compositions of the invention are useful in the treatment of acromegaly and cancer, e.g. Cushing's Disease.<br>
The activity and the characteristics of the liquid compositions of the invention may be indicated in standard clinical or animal tests.<br>
Appropriate dosage of the composition of the invention will of course vary, e.g. depending on the condition to be treated (for example the disease type of the nature of resistance), the drug used, the effect desired and the mode of administration.<br>
For compositions of the invention comprising a somatostatin analogue satisfactory results are obtained on administration, e.g. parenteral administration, at dosages on the order of from about 0.2 to about 60 mg, preferably from about 5 to about 40 mg per injection per month or about 0.03 to about 1.2 mg per kg animal body weight per month, administered once or in divided doses. Suitable monthly dosages for patients are thus in the order of about 0.3 mg to about 40 mg of a somatostatin analogue, e.g. Compound A pamoate. The composition may be administered every 2 to 3 months. Suitable dosages for every 3 months administration are about 1 mg to about 180 mg.<br>
Following is a description by way of example only of processes and compositions of the invention.<br>
