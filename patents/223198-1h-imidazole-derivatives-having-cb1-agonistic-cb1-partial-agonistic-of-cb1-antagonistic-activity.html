1H-lmidazole derivatives having CB1 agonistic, CB-1 partial agonistic or CB-r antaqonistic activity<br>
The present invention relates to a group of novel 1H-irnidazo!e derivatives, to methods for the preparation of these compounds, and to pharmaceutical compositions containing one or more of these compounds as an active component.<br>
These 1H-imidazoie derivatives are potent cannabinoid-CB1receptor agonists, partial agonists or antagonists, useful for the treatment of psychiatric and neurological disorders, as well as and other diseases involving cannabinoid neurotransmission.<br>
Cannabinoids are present in the Indian hemp Cannabis sativa and have been used as medicinal agents for centuries (Mechoulam, R. and Feigenbaum, J. J. Prog. Med. Chem. 1987, 24, 159). However, only within the past ten years the research in the cannabinoid area has revealed pivotal information on cannabinoid receptors and their (endogenous) agonists and antagonists. The discovery and the subsequent cloning of two different subtypes of cannabinoid receptors (CB1and CB2) stimulated the search for novel cannabinoid receptor antagonists (Munro, S. et a/., Nature 1993, 365, 61. Matsuda, L A. and Bonner, T. i. Cannabinoid Receptors, Pertwee, R. G, Ed. 1995, 117, Academic Press, London). In addition, pharmaceutical companies became interested in the development of cannabinoid drugs for the treatment of diseases connected with disorders of the cannabinoid system (Consroe, P. Neurobiology of Disease 1998, 5, 534. Pop, E. Curr. Opin. In CPNS Investigational Drugs 1999, 7, 587. Greenberg, D. A. Drug News Perspect. 1999, 72, 458. Pertwee, R.G., Progress in Neurobiology 2001, 63, 569). Hitherto, several CB^ receptor antagonists are known. Sanofi disclosed their diarylpyrazole congeners as selective CB1receptor antagonists. A representative example is SR-141716A (Dutta, A.K. et a/., Med. Chem. Res. 1994, 5, 54. Lan, R. et at., J. Med Chem. 1999, 42, 769. Nakamura-Paiacios, E. M. et a/., CNS Drug Rev. 1999, 5, 43). CP-272871 is a pyrazole derivative, like SR141716A, but less potent and less CB1receptor subtype-selective than SR141716A (Meschler, J. P. et at., Biochem. Pharmacol. 2000, 60, 1315). Aminoalkylindoles have been dis-closed as CB1 receptor antagonists. A representative example is lodopravadoiine (AM-630), which was introduced in 1995. AM-630 is a moderately active CB1receptor antagonist, in some assays behaving as a weak partial agonist (Hosohata, K. et a/,, Life Sc. 1997, 61, PL115). Researchers from Eli Lilly described aryl-aroyl substituted benzofurans as selective CB1receptor antagonists (e.g. LY-320135) (Felder, C. C. et a/., J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1998, 234; 291). 3-Aikyl-5,5'-diphenylimidazolidine-diones were described as cannabinoid receptor ligands, which were indicated to be cannabinoid antagonists (Kanyonyo, M. et a/., Biorg. Med.Chem. Lett. 1999, 9, 2233). Aventis Pharma claimed diarylmethyleneazetidine analogs as CB1receptor antagonists (Mignani, S, et a/., Patent FR 2783246, 2000; Chem. Abstr 2000, 732, 236982). Tricyclic pyrazoies were claimed by Sanofi-Synthelabo as CB-i antagonists (Barth, F. et al. Patent WO 0132663, 2001; Chem. Abstr. 2001, 734, 340504). Interestingly, many CB, receptor   '<br><br>
antagonists have been reported to behave as inverse agonists in vitro (Landsman, R. S. et a/., Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1997, 334, R1). Pyrazole cannabinoids have also been reported as CB-i receptor partial agonists showing in vivo cannabimimetic effects (Wiley, J. L et al.,J. Pharmacol. Exp. Then 2001, 296, 1013). A number of classes of CBT receptor agonists are known such as for example the classical cannabinoids (e.g. A9-THC), non-classical cannabinoids, aminoalkylindoles and eicosanoids (e.g. anandamide). Reviews provide a nice overview of the cannabinoid research area (Mechouiam, R. et a/., Prog. Med. Chem. 1998, 35, 199. Lambert, D. M. Curr. Med. Chem. 1999, 6, 635. Mechouiam, R. et a/., Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1998, 359, 1. Williamson, E. M. and Evans, F. J. Drugs 2000, 60, 1303. Pertwee, R. G. Addiction Biology 2000, 5, 37. Robson, P. Br. J. Psychiatry 2001, 178, 107. Pertwee, R. G. Prog. Neurobiol. 2001, 63, 569. Goya, P. and Jagerovic, N. Exp. Op'm. Ther. Patents 2000, 10, 1529. Pertwee, R. G. Gut 2001, 48, 859).<br>
It has now surprisingly been found that the novel 1H-imidazole derivatives of the formula (I), prodrugs thereof and salts thereof, are potent agonists, partial agonists or antagonists on cannabinoid-CB1receptors<br><br>

Due to the potent CB-i agonistic, partial agonistic or antagonistic activity the compounds according to the invention are suitable for use in the treatment of psychiatric disorders such as psychosis, anxiety, depression, attention deficits, memory disorders, cognitive disorders, appetite disorders, obesity, addiction, 1 appetence, drug dependence and neurological disorders such as neurodegenerative disorders, dementia, dystonia, muscle spasticity, tremor, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, traumatic brain injury, stroke, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, epilepsy, Huntington's disease, Tourette's syndrome, cerebral ischaemia, cerebral apoplexy, craniocerebral trauma, stroke, spinal cord injury, neuroinflammatory disorders, plaque sclerosis, viral encephalitis, demyelinisation related disorders, as well as for the treatment of pain disorders, including neuropathic pain disorders, and other diseases involving cannabinoid neurotransmission, including the treatment of septic shock, glaucoma, diabetes, cancer, emesis, nausea, gastrointestinal disorders, gastric ulcers, diarrhoea and cardiovascular disorders.<br>
The affinity of the compounds of the invention for cannabinoid CB-j receptors was determined using membrane preparations of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells in which the human cannabinoid CB1receptor is stably transfected in conjunction with [3H]CP-55,940 as radioligand. After incubation of a freshly prepared cell membrane preparation with the [3H]-ligand, with or without addition of compounds of the invention, separation of bound and free ligand was performed by filtration over glassfiber filters. Radioactivity on the filter was measured by liquid scintillation counting.<br>
The cannabinoid CB1 antagonistic activity of compounds of the invention was determined by functional studies using CHO cells in which human cannabinoid CBt receptors are stably expressed. Adenylyl cyclase was stimulated using forskolin and measured by quantifying the amount of accumulated cyclic AMP. Concomitant activation of CBt receptors by CB-, receptor agonists (e.g. CP-55,940 or (R)-WIN-55,212-2) can attenuate the forskolin-induced accumulation of cAMP in a concentration-dependent manner. This CB1receptor-mediated response can be antagonized by CB-i receptor antagonists such as the compounds of the invention.<br>
Cannabinoid agonistic of partial agonistic activity of compounds of the invention can be determined according to published methods, such as assessment of//? vivo cannabimimetic effects (Wiley, J. L et a/., J. Pharmacol. Exp.  Ther. 2001, 296,<br>
1013).<br>
The invention relates both to racemates, mixtures of diastereomers and the individual stereoisomers of the compounds having formula (I).<br><br>
The compounds of the invention can be brought into forms suitable for administration by means of usual processes using auxiliary substances and/or liquid or solid carrier materials.<br>

Example 1<br>
Part A: To a 1M solution of sodium bis(trimethylsilyl) amide in THF (70 mL) is added dropwise a solution of 4-chloroaniline (8.86 gram, 69.5 mmol) in anhydrous THF in a nitrogen atmosphere. After the mixture is stirred for 20 minutes a solution of 2,4-dichlorobenzonitrile (12 gram, 70 mmol) in THF is added. The resulting mixture is stirred overnight, poured into ice-water (400 mL) and extracted with dichloromethane, dried over Na2S04 and concentrated in vacuo to give a yellow oil (15.7 gram). Crystallisation from a dichloromethane/heptane mixture, and subsequent washing with methyl-t-butyl ether gives N-(4-chlorophenyl)-2,4-dichiorobenzenecarboxamidine (8.66 gram, 42% yield) as a yellow solid. Melting point (MP): 93-95 °C.<br>
Analogously was prepared:<br>
-    N-(4-bromophenyl)~2,4-dichiorobenzenecarboxamidine. MP: 117-119 °C.<br>
Part B: A mixture of N-(4-chIorophenyl)-2]4-dichiorobenzenecarboxamidine (2.00 gram, 6.68 mmol), ethyl 3-bromo-2-oxopropanoate (2.65 gram, 13.6 mmol) and NaHCOz (1.12 gram, 13.3 mmol) in 2-propanol is stirred at reflux temperature for 20 hours. After cooling to room temperature the mixture is concentrated in vacuo and the residue suspended in dichloromethane, washed with water (3 x 50 mL) and brine (3 x 50 mL). The aqueous layers are extracted with dichloromethane. The combined organic layers are dried over Na2S04 and concentrated in vacuo to afford crude brown product (2.0 gram). This product is further purified by column chromatography (silicagel, heptane/EtOAc = 90/10 (v/v)) to yield ethyl 1-(4-chlorophenyl)-2-(2,4-dichIorophenyI)-1H-imidazole-4-carboxylate (0.759 gram, 29 % yield) as a yellow oil which slowly solidifies on standing. Melting point: 150-152 °C; MS: 395 (MH+). 1H-NMR (400 MHz, CDCI3): 5 7.91 (s, 1H), 7.49 (dd, J = 8 Hz: J = 2 Hz, 1H), 7.29-7.36 (m, 4H), 7.07 (dt, J = 8 Hz, J= 2 Hz, 2H), 4.44 (q, J = 7 Hz, 2H), 1.42 (t, J =7 Hz, 3H). Part C: Ethyl 1-(4-chlorophenyl)-2-(2,4-dichIorophenyl)-1H-imidazole-4-carboxylate (0.810 gram, 2.06 mmol) and LiOH (0.173 g, 7.20 mmol) are dissolved in a H20/THF (20 mL/20 mL) mixture and stirred at 50 °C for 16 hours. The mixture is concentrated in vacuo to give 1-(4-chlorophenyi)-2-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-1H-imidazole-4-carboxylic acid.
