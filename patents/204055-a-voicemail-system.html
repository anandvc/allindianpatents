				<td>WE CLAIM:<br>
1.	A voicemail system for a communication link including a wireless<br>
local loop (20) comprising:<br>
a voicemail server (116) connected to a first network node that includes a wireless base station (24) of said wireless local loop (20); and,<br>
a voicemail client (216) connected to a second network node that includes a wireless subscriber station (32) of said wireless local loop (20), operable with said voicemail server (116) to transceive voicemail messages therebetween via said communication link, such that lower priority voicemail messages are stored as an entirety at one of the network nodes before being transferred to the other network node at a later time, priority of said voicemail messages determined taking into account at least one of available bandwidth over said wireless local loop (20), a level of service subscribed by each said subscriber station (32), said level of service reflecting a priority of bandwidth in relation to at least one other said subscriber station (32), a duration of time any previous voicemail message between said voicemail server (116) and said voicemail client (216) has been awaiting transfer, and a order in which previous voicemail messages awaiting transfer between said voicemail server (116) and said voicemail client (216) have been recorded .<br>
2.	The voicemail system as claimed in claim 1 wherein said voicemail server (116) and said voicemail client (216) are each operable to compress a voicemail prior to transfer from said first network node and decompress said compressed voicemail upon receipt at said second network node.<br>
3.	The voicemail system as claimed in claim 1 wherein said voicemail server (116) and said voicemail client (216) are operable to transfer said voicemail in bursts.<br><br><br>
t. The voicemail system as claimed in claim 1 wherein said voicemail server (116) and said voicemail client (216) are operable to transfer said voicemail over a channel between said antennas that is different in bandwidth from the bandwidth otherwise necessary to transfer said voicemail at a normal playback rate between said voicemail server (116) and said voicemail client (216).<br>
5.	The voicemail system as claimed in claim 4 said channel has a bandwidth allocated to it that is larger than the bandwidth otherwise necessary to transfer said voicemail at a normal playback rate between said voicemail server (116) and said voicemail client (216) and said voicemail server (116) and said voicemail client (216) are operable to transfer a voicemail at a faster rate than otherwise used to carry a voice telephone call therebetween.<br>
6.	The voicemail system as claimed in claim 4 said channel has a bandwidth allocated to it that is lower that the bandwidth otherwise necessary to transfer said voicemail at a normal playback rate and said voicemail server (116) and said voicemail client (216) are operable to transfer a voicemail at a slower rate than otherwise used to carry a voice telephone call therebetween.<br>
7.	The voicemail system as claimed in claim 1 wherein said subscriber station (32) is operable to present a notice to a subscriber respective to said subscriber station (32) that said subscriber has a voicemail message.<br>
8.	The voicemail system as claimed in claim 7 wherein said notice is a stutter-dial tone.<br>
9.	A method for processing voicemail messages in a wireless local loop (20) having a base station (24) operable to exchange information with a subscriber station (32), said base station (24) having a voicemail<br><br><br>
server (116) that is operable with a voicemail client (216) local to said subscriber station (32) to transfer voicemail messages therebetween, said method comprising the steps of:<br>
initiating a voicemail program in said voicemail server (116) if a telephone call destined for said subscriber station (32) and received at said base station (24) is not answered;<br>
initiating a voicemail program in said voicemail client (216) if a telephone call from said subscriber station (32) to a destination subscriber station (32) is not answered;<br>
determining whether there is sufficient bandwidth available for allocating a channel between said base station (24) and said subscriber station (32) to transfer a voicemail message taking into account at least one of available bandwidth over said wireless local loop (20), a level of service subscribed by each said subscriber station (32), said level of service reflecting a priority of bandwidth in relation to at least one other said subscriber station (32), a duration of time any previous voicemail message between said voicemail server (116) and said voicemail client (216) has been awaiting transfer, and a order in which previous voicemail messages awaiting transfer between said voicemail server (116) and said voicemail client (216) have been recorded;<br>
if sufficient bandwidth is immediately available, allocating a channel between said base station (24) and said subscriber station (32) and, in the case of a telephone call destined for said subscriber station (32), recording a voicemail on said voicemail client (216), and in the case of a telephone call from said subscriber station (32) to a destination subscriber, recording a voicemail at one of said voicemail server (116) and said destination subscriber station (32); and<br>
if insufficient bandwidth is immediately available, in the case of a telephone call destined for said subscriber station (32), recording said voicemail as an entirety on said voicemail server (116) for subsequent transferal of said voicemail to said voicemail client (216) when sufficient bandwidth becomes available, and in the case of a telephone call from said subscriber station (32) to a destination subscriber, recording said<br>
17<br><br>
voicemail as an entirety on said voicemail client (216) if insufficient bandwidth is immediately available, said recording on said voicemail client (216) for subsequent transferal of said voicemail to one of said voicemail server (116) and said destination subscriber when sufficient bandwidth becomes available.<br>
10.	The method as claimed in claim 9 wherein said voicemail server (116) and said voicemail client (216) are each operable to compress a voicemail prior to transfer and decompress said compressed voicemail upon receipt.<br>
11.	The method as claimed in claim 9 or 10 wherein said voicemail server (116) and said voicemail client (216) are operable to transfer said voicemail in bursts.<br>
12.	The method as claimed in claim 9 wherein said voicemail server (116) and said voicemail client (216) are operable to transfer said voicemail over a channel between said antennas that is different in bandwidth from the bandwidth otherwise necessary to transfer said voicemail at a normal playback rate between said voicemail server (116) and said voicemail client (216).<br>
13.	The method as claimed in claim 12 said channel has a bandwidth allocated to it that is lower that the bandwidth otherwise necessary to transfer said voicemail at a normal playback rate and said voicemail server (116) and said voicemail client (216) are operable to transfer a voicemail at a slower rate than otherwise used to carry a voice telephone call therebetween.<br><br>
