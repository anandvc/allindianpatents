The present invention relates to a method of coding and/or transmitting EPG (electronic program guide) data documents comprising program records and schedule records. The invention also relates to a coder for coding EPG data comprising program records and schedule records and to a device comprising a receiver for receiving transmitted coded EPG data comprising a decoder for decoding coded EPG data comprising program records and schedule records.<br>
It is known to transmit information and listings of program information by means of so-called electronic program guides (EPG), which are based on the transmission of a large database of program information. Conventionally, the EPG data produced by e.g. a server regarding programs and their scheduled times is structured into sections. The EPG data is transmitted to a receiving device such as e.g. a remote control device.<br>
Embedded and/or restricted devices need to download large sets of EPG data from some server (via Internet, cable, GSM, or any other network). Since devices have limited computing and storage capability, it can be difficult to store all EPG data in a memory.<br>
It is possible to separate the TV listing data in 1) programs and 2) schedules for that program. This separation makes it possible that a program that is rerun several times has only one program record with multiple schedule records.<br>
For example, the show with the title Business news* and description 'an update on today's business worldwide*, will be rerun at 9PM, 10PM, and 11 PM. In that case, there will be one record that contains the program information (program ID, title, description, comments, ...), i.e.:<br>
('P3992', 'Business news', 'an update on today*s business worldwide1, ....)<br>
Three schedule records will refer to this program. The first schedule will<br>
contain the<br><br>
(schedule ID, reference to program ID, start time, end time, indication of time shift,...), i.e.:<br>
CS0051, 'P3992', '9PM*, '9:30PM\ 'live',..,.), CS006% 'P3992', '10PMr, '10:30PM1, 'rerun',....) CS0071, 'P3992V11PM\ '11:30PM5, 'rerun',.....)<br>
This known approach saves a lot of space as compared to joining both the program and schedule data into one record. Without joining, also the program info (title, description,,.,) would be repeated three times.<br>
Examples of such a data coding scheme are e.g. known from US patents 6,263,501 and 5,652,613.<br>
Although this scheme is efficient, problems may arise when a large set of EPG data is transmitted to (or downloaded on) a device having a relatively small memory or when the transmission is interrupted. In such cases, the present coding schemes for EPG data to be transmitted lead to a loss of useful information.<br>
It is an object of the invention to provide a method, coder and device of the type described in the opening paragraph, allowing an increase of directly useful information, or a reduction of loss of useful information.<br>
To this end a method, coder and device of the type in accordance with the invention are characterized in that the program records and schedule records of the EPG data are coded and/or transmitted and received in an order in which program records and schedule records are interleaved. Interleaved means that each program record is followed or preceded by the corresponding schedule records before or after another program record is coded and/or transmitted. Thus, the program (p) and schedule records (s) are sorted as follows:<br>
	{pl,sll,sl2v..sli},{p23s21,s223...s2i}, {p3,s31,s32,s3i,...},etc.<br>
(preferably) or<br>
alternatively<br><br>
{Sll?sl2j....sli,pl}j{s213s22,...s2i,p2}&gt;s313s32v..s3i)p3}<br>
wherein pi, p23 p3, etc. are program records and sll5sl25..sli are schedule records corresponding to program record pl and s21, s22,,.,.s2i are schedule records corresponding to p2, etc.<br>
The inventors have realized that data is transmitted as follows in the known<br>
transmission schemes:<br>
The data is divided into separate sections comprising:<br>
a section with a list of program records	short<br><br>
The indication p1, p2, s 11, sl2 etc., to the right-hand side is shown here for identification purposes to clarify the concept, but do not form part of the records.<br>
In itself, this coding and transmission scheme offers a very efficient manner of coding, transmitting and organizing the data in many circumstances.<br>
If the total transmitted data does not overload the memory of the device and the transmission is uninterrupted, no real problems occur. However, the problem is that, since the memory is limited, the device may not have enough storage to store all records in the<br><br>
memory. It would have to stop storing downloaded EPG data in the memory when it is full or when a certain limit has been reached. If the transmission is interrupted, a similar phenomenon would occur.<br>
In such circumstances the result might be that, whereas all program records are stored, only a few schedule records have been stored. In that case, the receiving device can only use part of the information on TV programs that has been received, because the crucial corresponding schedule records are missing for at least some program records. In fact, the program records that have been stored and for which the schedule records are missing take up valuable memory space.<br>
The same phenomenon occurs when the schedule records are first transmitted, in which case the crucial corresponding program records are missing for at least some schedule records.<br>
A related phenomenon occurs when the transmission is interrupted during transmission of the EPG data. In such cases, the problem is not a too small memory, but the interruption of transmission of data.<br>
Stored information is only truly useful when it is complete. In the circumstances described above, much of the information received is thus incomplete and, consequently, not truly useful.<br>
The efficiency of the data transmission in a data coding method, a coder and device in accordance with the invention is increased because the device can read, parse and store the downloaded EPG data on the fly as it is being received (it can start reading, parsing and storing before the reception of data all has finished). At any time when the device would have to stop storing EPG data (whether due to a lack of available storage space or an unforeseen interruption of transmission) in the memory, almost all of the data (except for possibly the ones received the very last) that was stored can actually be used.<br>
Preferably, the interleaved program and schedule records are sorted on a time basis.<br>
If sorted on time, all data up to a certain time is known to be complete. Gaps in the data are avoided.<br>
It is noted that the total EPG document may have other additional information sections such as a section with detailed information on the content of programs. Preferably, these additional information sections are sorted and/or transmitted after a section with interleaved and sorted program records. The additional information is often background information which is of less importance than the combination of program and schedule<br><br>
records. Such information, although useful, does affect the usefulness of the coded data much less than the interleaved program and schedule records. By coding the interleaved program records and schedule records in a section coded prior (i.e. in front of and transmitted prior to the rest) to other sections comprising information on programs, the most important information is transmitted first. The section comprising the interleaved program records and schedule records may be preceded in the coding scheme by short codes with general information, e.g., for identifying the EPG data as such or identifying the section as such. Preferably, the coding scheme is such that schedule records only refer to program records that are placed above them (not below them) in the scheme<br><br>
this scheme offers the advantage that all received information can be identified and allocated and this is useful, whereas in the alternative scheme the last received information part (because of missing the program record) might not be useful.<br>
The EPG document (the section related to the program &amp; schedule info) always starts with a program record:progress /.(pi) The first schedule record: shedder 1 comes directly thereafter. This schedule record will refer to the program 1 just before it (pi) and thus could be named si L This scheme is repeated for all programs, and sorted on the basis of date/time of the schedule records. Only in the case where a program record is a rerun, i.e. would be duplicate, the program record is omitted. The following schedule record refers to a program record somewhat above it. In this case, two (or more) schedule records follow each other, which could be named si 1 and sl2, etc.<br>
section with a list of interleaved and sorted program records and schedule records<br><br><br><br>
A possible implementation could consist of:<br>
1 -	A screen-based remote control (RC) device, used to control the display device<br>
and display the EPG content;<br>
2.	An Internet-access device, used for downloading EPG content onto the control<br>
(RC) device;<br>
3.	An Internet server, from which EPG content in the form of EPG documents<br>
can be retrieved;<br>
Operations are e.g.:<br>
1.	On a regular basis, depending on Internet access bandwidth and remote control<br>
device memory constraints, the RC requests EPG content from the server. Alternatively, the<br>
server may push an EPG document, i.e. send it even without an implicit request.<br>
2.	In response to such a request, the server prepares an EPG document coded in accordance with the ordering, sorting and program/schedule interleaving rules in this invention or it may push it. For instance, the EPG data is encoded in an XML format It is to be noted that the server may comprise a document which is already encoded in the manner of the invention, in which case "preparation" is simply taken for the document that has already been properly encoded or, alternatively, if such a document is not directly available, the server prepares such an EPG document by retrieving information from other documents and by coding the information in the manner of the invention. To this end, the server comprises, has access to or is linked with, a coder for coding an EPG document in accordance with the invention.<br>
3.	The server will start sending the (partially) prepared EPG document to the RC.<br>
4.	On the fly, the EPG document is received, parsed and stored in persistent<br>
storage on the RC. To this end, the RC device (or any other device for receiving the EPG<br><br>
data) comprises a receiver and a decoder for decoding the RPG data document coded in accordance with the invention.<br>
5.	When finished, or when the storage on the receiving device exceeds a certain<br>
limit, the data is still received, but cannot be stored in the memory anymore. Optionally, the<br>
connection can be terminated.<br>
6.	The device is certain that all stored data can be optimally used, also when not<br>
all data could have been stored. This is the great advantage of using interleaved program<br>
records and schedule records, in comparison with the known method of coding and<br>
transmitting the data in separate program code and schedule code sections.<br>
Access to this Internet site or sites by the remote control device is provided through, e.g., an Internet-connected device. This may be a PC, set top box (STB) or dedicated Internet-connection device like a modem.<br>
The invention can be used, e.g., in TV receivers and VCRs or multi-media PCs equipped with a video/delete capture card.<br>
An example of an implementation of XML encoded EPG data is given below.<br><br><br><br><program id="69782"><br><title>News</title><br><description>The daily news.</description></program><br><schedule program="69782" channel="31" starttime="09:00:00" endtime="'lOrOOrOO'/'7&lt;br/&gt;
