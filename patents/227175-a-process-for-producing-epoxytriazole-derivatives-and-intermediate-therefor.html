TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to production methods of intermediates, particularly epoxytriazole derivative, for triazole compounds useful as an anti-fungal agent.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
The epoxytriazole derivative represented by the formula {VI)<br><br>
{hereinafter to be also referred to as epoxytriazole derivative (VI)) is a useful synthetic intermediate for anti-fungal agents, such as triazole compounds described in JP-A-4-356471, JP-A-5-230038' and the like.     <br><br>
The production methods of epoxytriazole derivative (VI) have been reported in, for example. Bulletin of the Chemical Society of Japan (Bull. Chem. Soc. Jpn), Vol. 67, 1427-1433 (1994) ,<br>
Chemical &amp; Pharmaceutical Bulletin (Chem. ?harm. Bull.), Vol. 43(3), 432-440 (1995),<br>
and the Like. According to these methods, as shown in the following reaction schemes, epoxidation of a compound of the formula (VII) {hereinafter to be also referred to as compound (VII)) therein hydroxyl group is protected by a protecting group, such is tetrahydropyranyl group and the like, is conducted using trimethyloxosulfonium halide.<br><br><br>
The compound (VII) used as a starting material in conventional methods can be produced by protecting hydroxyl group of a compound, wherein tetrahydropyranyl group of the formula (VII) has been substituted by hydroxyl group (to be also referred to as a deprotected compound of compound (VII)), with tetrahydropyranyl group. However, the introduction of a protecting group is uneconomical because it requires an equimolar amount of tetrahydropyranyl derivative relative to the deprotected compound of compound (VII), and the like.  In addition, the introduction of protecting group necessitates a deprotection step, thus increasing the number of steps and the like. Moreover, the introduction of protecting group leads to inefficiency. Thus, this method is industrially disadvantageous. According to conventional methods, moreover, stereoisomers, which are in a diastereoraeric relationship and are unable to be used as an intermediate for a triazole compound, which is an anti-fungal agent, are by-produced in about 20%. The a-hydroxy-ketone derivative, which is a deprotected compound of compound (VII), is chemically unstable, and the above-mentioned epoxidation without protection of Hydroxyl group has been considered to be difficult.<br>
It is therefore an object of the present invention to arovide a method for economically and efficiently producing<br><br>
epoxytriazole derivative (V) to be mentioned below, such as epoxytriazole derivative (VIJ and the like, or an intermediate therefor, with high quality by an industrial means.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION As a result of the intensive studies done by the present inventors, they have found that the above-mentioned epoxidation unexpectedly proceeds even without protecting the deprotected compound of compound (VII), which has been expected to be difficult.

The production methods of the present invention are shown in the following schemes in summary fashion.<br><br>
wherein each symbol is as defined for the aforementioned 1 and<br>
8.<br>
1. Production method of confound (II) (Step A)<br>
The confound (II) can be obtained by, for exairple, reacting compound (I) with trimethyloxosulfonium salt or trimethylsulfonium salt in a solvent in the presence of a base. The order of addition of the reagents is not particularly<br><br>
limited, and, for example, trimethyloxosulfonium salt or trimethylsulfonium salt and a base may be added to a solvent and then compound (I) may be added; or a solution of trimethyloxosulfonium salt or trimethylsulfonium salt may be added to a solvent and then a base may be added thereto to allow reaction and the obtained solution may be added to a solution of compound (I) in a solvent.<br>
The base to be used in Step A is not particularly limited as long as it reacts with trimethyloxosulfonium salt or trimethylsulfonium salt to give sulfur ylide. Examples thereof include alkali metal hydroxides such as potassium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide, lithium hydroxide and the like; alkali metal hydrides such as sodium hydride, potassium hydride, lithium hydride and the like; alkyl-alkali metals such as n-butyllithium, methyllithium, n-hexyliithium and the like; alkali metal amides such as sodium amide, potassium amide, lithium diisopropyl amide, lithium dicyclohexyl amide, lithium hexamethyl disilazide and the like; alkali metal alkojtides such as potassium tert-butoxide, sodium tert-butoxide, sodium methoxide, sodium ethoxide, potassium methoxide, potassium ethoxide and the like; and the like, with preference given to sodium hydride.  Sodium hydride may be dispersed in mineral oil such as liquid paraffin and the like and added dropwise.<br>
The amount of the base to be used in Step A is generally 0.25 mol - 1.1 mol, preferably 0.5 mol - 1.0 mol, more preferably 0.6 mol - 0.9 mol, relative to 1 mol of trimethyloxosulfonium salt or trimethylsulfonium salt. When the amount of the base to be used in Step A is less than 0.25 mol relative to 1 mol of trimethyloxosulfonium salt or trimethylsulfonium salt, trimethyloxosulfonium salt or trimethylsulfonium salt remains more than necessary, which is economically disadvantageous, and unpreferably causes side reaction. When the amount of the base to be used exceeds 1.1<br><br>
mol relative to 1 mol of trimethyloxosulfonium salt or trimethylsulfonium salt, a base unreacted with trimethyloxosulfonium salt or trimethylsulfonium salt remains in excess, which is economically disadvantageous and causes a side reaction (mostly isomerization) to possibly degrade the yield and quality.<br>
The amount of trimethyloxosulfonium salt or trimethylsulfonium salt to be used in Step A is generally 0.8 mol - 5.0 mol, preferably 1.0 mol - 3.0 mol, more preferably 1.1 mol - 2.5 mol, relative to 1 mol of compound (I), When the amount of trimethyloxosulfonium salt or trimethylsulfonium salt to be used in Step A is less than 0.8 mol relative to 1 mol of compound (!), compound (I) partly remains unreacted to possibly lower the yield. When the amount of trimethyloxosulfonium salt or trimethylsulfonium salt to be used exceeds 5.0 mol relative to 1 mol of compound (I), the effect corresponding to the amount used cannot be afforded, which is economically disadvantageous.<br>
The solvent to be used in Step A may be any as long as it ioes not inhibit the reaction. Examples thereof include ethers 5uch as tetrahydrofuran (THF), methyl tert-butyl ether, 1,4-iioxane, diethylene glycol dimethyl ether (diglyme), ethylene glycol dimethyl ether, 1,3-dioxolane, 2-methyltetrahydrofuran and the like; aprotic polar solvents such as N,N-limethylformamide (DMF) , N,N-dimethylacetamide (DMAc) , dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), sulfolane, N-methyl-2~pyrrolidinone (NMP), ,3-dimethyl-2-imidazolidinone (DMI), hexamethyl phosphoramide HMPA), nitrobenzene, carbon disulfide, acetonitrile, ropionitrile and the like; halogenated solvents such as ethylene chloride, 1,2-dichloroethane, monochlorobenzene, 1,2-ichlorobenzene, 2-chlorotoluene, 3-chlorotoluene, 4-hlorotoluene, 2-chloro-m-xylene, 2-chLQro-p-xylene, 4-Ghloro--xylene, 2,3-dichlorotoluene, 2,4-dichlorotoluene, 2,5-<br><br>
dichlorotoluene, 2,6-dichlorotoluene, 3,4-dichlorotoluene, monofluorobenzene and the like; aromatic hydrocarbon such as toluene, xylene and the like; and the like, and a mixed solvent thereof. When a mixed solvent is used, the solvents may be mixed at optional ratios by a conventionally known method.<br>
The amount of the solvent to be used is generally 1 L -50 L, preferably 4 L - 30 L, more preferably 5 L - 25 L, relative to 1 kg of compound (I).<br>
While the reaction temperature in Step A depends on the reagent to be used and the like, the reaction of Step A generally proceeds frora -40Â°C to 120'C, preferably from -20'C to 60Â°C,  more preferably from -lO^C to 4000, generally for 0.5 hr -24 hr, preferably 1 hr - 8 hr.<br>
The compound (II) to be obtained in Step A can be isolated and purified by a conventional method. For example, the reaction mixture is poured into water and partitioned, the organic layer is washed and filtrated, and the obtained filtrate is washed, dried and concentrated under reduced<br>
pressure to isolate compound {II). After the isolation, for<br>
example, it is subjected to silica gel column chromatography<br>
for purification. The compound (II) can be used for the next<br>
reaction without purification.<br>
(2R,3R)-3-(2',5'-Difluorophenyl)-3,4-epoxy-2-butanol,<br>
which is one of the compounds (II) obtained in step A, is a<br>
novel compound, and can be produced by using (2R)-2',5'-<br>
difluoro-2-hydroxypropiophenone as compound (I).<br>
The compound (I), which is a starting material in Step A,<br>
can be synthesized by a method described in Bull. Chem. Soc.<br>
Jpn, Vol. 60, 1027-1036 (1987) and the like. For example,<br>
compound (I) wherein Ar is a 2,4-difluorophenyl group and R is<br>
methyl, can be obtained by deprotection of the<br>
tetrahydropyranyloxy group of compound (VII) disclosed in Bull.<br>
them. Soc. Jpn, Vol. 67, 1427-1433 (1994), by a known method.<br><br>
An optically active compound (I) can be obtained by deprotection of optically active compound (VII) disclosed in Chem. Pharm. Bull., Vol. 41(6), 1035-1042 (1993) in the same manner, or by the method described in Tetrahedron Letters, 37, 8117-8120 (1996). By the use of optically active compound (I), an optically active form of compound (11) can be obtained.<br>
(2R)-2',4'-Difluoro-2-hydroxypropiophenone, which is one of compounds (I), can be produced by deprotection of (2R)-2-(l-ethoxyethoxy)-1-(2,4-difluorophenyl)-1-propanone. {2R)-2-(1-Ethoxyethoxy)-1-(2,4-difluorophenyl)-1-propanone is a novel compound, and can be produced by a method described in Reference Example 1 below or a method analogous thereto. That is, (R)-alkyl lactate is reacted with dialkylamine to give (R)-dialkyl lactamide, which is reacted with ethyl vinyl ether to protect hydroxyl group with 1-ethoxyethyl group, and then reacted with 2,4-difluorophenylmagnesium halide.<br>
(2R)-2',5'-Difluoro-2-hydroxypropiophenone, which is the other compound (I), can be produced by deprotection of (2R)-2-(1-ethoxyethoxy)-1-(2,5-difluorophenyl)-1-propanone.  (2R) -2 ' ,5'-Difluoro-2-hydroxypropiophenone and (2R)-2-(1-ethoxyethoxy)-1-(2,5-difluorophenyl)-1-propanone are novel compounds and can be produced in the same manner as above using 2,5-difluorophenylmagnesium halide instead of 2,4-difluorophenylmagnesium halide. 2. Production method of compound (III) (Step B)<br>
The compound (III) can be obtained by, for example, reacting compound (II) with 1,2,4-triazole in a solvent in the presence of a base. The order of addition of the reagents is lot particularly limited. For example, 1,2,4-triazole and a Dase may be added to a solvent and then compound (II) may be idded; or 1,2,4-triazole may be added to a solvent and a base nay be added to allow reaction and the solution may be added to 1 solution of compound (II) in a solvent.<br><br>
The base to be used in Step B is not particularly limited as long as it forms a stable salt with 1,2,4-triazole. Examples thereof include alkali metal hydroxides such as sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, lithium hydroxide and the like; alkali metal carbonates such as potassium carbonate, sodium carbonate, lithium carbonate, cesium carbonate and the like; alkali metal hydrides such as sodium hydride, potassium hydride, lithium hydride and the like; alkyl-alkali metals such as n-butyllithium, methyllithium, n-hexyllithium and the like; alkali metal amides such as sodium amide, potassium amide, lithium diisopropyl amide, lithium dicyclohexyl amide, lithium hexamethyl disilazide and the like; alkali metal alkoxides such as potassium tert-butoxide, sodium tert-butoxide, potassium methoxide, sodium methoxide, sodium ethoxide, potassium ethoxide and the like; tertiary amines such as 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]-7-undecene, l,5-diazabicyclo[4.3.0]-5-nonene, 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane, N,N,N',N'-tetramethylethylene diamine, N,N-diisopropylethylamine, triethylaraine and the like; and the like, with preference given to sodium hydride and potassiim carbonate. Sodium hydride may be dispersed in mineral oil such as liquid paraffin and the like and added dropwise.<br>
The amount of the base to be used in Step B is generally 0.3 mol - 1.3 mol, preferably 0.5 mol - 1.1 mol, more preferably 0.8 mol - 1.0 mol, relative to 1 mol of 1,2,4-Lriazole. The amount of the base to be used in Step B, which Ls less than 0.3 mol relative to 1 mol of 1,2,4-triazole, is inpreferable, because 1,2,4-triazole remains more than lecessary, which is economically disadvantageous, and 1,2,4-iriazole remaining after the reaction needs to be separated. Ihen the amount of the base to be used exceeds 1.3 mol relative :o 1 mol of 1,2,4-triazole, a base that does not react with .,2,4-triazole remains in excess, which is economically<br><br>
disadvantageous, and causes a side reaction to possibly degrade the yield and quality.<br>
The amount of 1,2,4-triazole to be used in Step B is generally 0.8 raol - 5.0 mol, preferably 1.0 mol - 3.0 mol, more preferably 1.1 mol - 2.0 mol, relative to 1 mol of compound (II). When the amount of 1,2,4-triazole to be used in Step B is less than 0.8 raol relative to 1 mol of compound (11), compound (II) partly remains unreacted to possibly lower the yield. The amount of 1,2,4-triazole to be used, which exceeds 5.0 mol relative to 1 mol of compound (II), is unpreferable, because 1,2,4-triazole not involved in the reaction remains in excess, which is economically disadvantageous, and 1,2,4-triazole remaining after reaction needs to be separated.<br>
To promote the reaction in Step B, for example, a phase-transfer catalyst such as tetraalkyl ammonium salts (e.g., octadecyl trimethyl ammonium bromide, tetrabutyl ammonium sulfate, tetrabutyl ammonium bromide, tetrabutyl ammonium iodide, tetrabutyl ammonium chloride and the like), trialkyl benzyl ammonium salts (e.g., benzyl trimethyl ammonium bromide, benzyl trimethyl aitffcionium chloride, benzyl triethyl ammoniijm chloride and the like); and the like may be added.<br>
The solvent to be used in Step B may be any as long as it does not inhibit the reaction. Examples thereof include ethers such as THF, methyl tert-butyl ether, 1,4-dioxane, diethylene glycol dimethyl ether (diglyme), ethylene glycol dimethyl ether, 1,3-dioxolane, 2-methyltetrahydrofuran and the like; aprotic polar solvents such as DMF, DMAc, DMSO, sulfolane, NMP, DMI, HMPA, methyl isobutyl ketone, methyl ethyl ketone, acetone, cyclohexanone, 3-pentanone, nitrobenzene, carbon disulfide, acetonitrile, propionitrile and the like; halogenated solvents such as methylene chloride, 1,2-dichloroethane, monochlorobenzene, 1,2-dichlorobenzene, 2-chlorotoluene, 3-chlorotoluene, 4-chlorotoluene, 2-chloro-ra-<br><br>

When a mixed solvent is used, the solvents may be mixed at optional ratios by a conventionally known method.<br>
The amount of the solvent to be used is generally 1 L -50 L, preferably 3 L - 30 L, more preferably 5 L - 25 L, relative to 1 kg of compound (II).<br>
While the reaction temperature in Step B depends on the reagent to be used and the like, the reaction of Step B generally proceeds from -20 C to ISCC, preferably from 0'Â»C to 100 C, more preferably from 20Â°C to 90Â°C, generally for 0.5 hr -24 hr, preferably 1 hr - 10 hr.<br>
The compound (III) to be obtained in Step B can be isolated and purified by a conventional method. For example, the reaction mixture is poured into water and partitioned, the organic layer is washed and filtrated, and the obtained filtrate is washed, dried and concentrated under reduced pressure to isolate compound (III). After the isolation, for example, it is subjected to silica gel column chromatography for purification. The compound (III) can be used for the next reaction without purification.<br>
The epoxytriazole derivative (V) can be derived from<br>
compound (HI) by a known method, for example, a method<br>
described in Bull. Chem. Soc. Jpn, Vol. 67, 1427-1433 (1994). 3. Production method of compound (IV) (Step C)<br>
The compound (IV) can be produced by, for example, introducing hydroxyl group of compound (II) into sulfonic acid ester (-OSO2R1) .<br>
In Step C, a method for deriving hydroxyl group of compound (II) into sulfonic acid ester may be, for example, a<br><br>
method comprising reacting compound (II) with sulfonyl halide of the formula: ySO2R1 (XI) wherein Y is chlorine atom or bromine atom and R1 is as defined above {hereinafter to be also referred to as sulfonyl halide (XI)), or sulfonic anhydride of the formula: -0(SO2R1)2 (XII) wherein R1 is as defined above (hereinafter to be also referred to as sulfonic anhydride (XII)) in a solvent in the presence of a base. The order of addition of the reagents is not particularly limited. For example, compound (11) and base may be added to a solvent and then sulfonyl halide (XI) or sulfonic anhydride (XII) (hereinafter to be also referred to as sulfonyl halide and the like, when these are not particularly distinguished) may be added; or compound (II), sulfonyl halide and the like may be added to a solvent and then a base may be added.<br>
The base to be used in Step C is, for example, aliphatic tertiary amines (e.g., trimethylamine, triethylaraine, tributylamine, diisopropylethylamine, N-methylmorpholine and the like) , aromatic amines (e.g., pyridine, picoline, 2,6-lutidine, collidine, 4-(N,N-dimethylamino)pyridine, N,N-dimethylaniline, N,N-diethylaniline and the like) or alkali metal carbonates (e.g., sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate and the like), basic ion-exchange resins (e.g., amberlight IRA-67, amberlight IRA-900 and the like), and the like, preferred is triethylaraine or sodium carbonate, and particularly preferred is triethylamine.<br>

When the amount of the base to be used in Step C is less than 0.8 mol relative to 1 mol of sulfonyl halide and the like, the generated acid cannot be trapped and side reaction occurs.  In addition, the reaction rate tends to be unpreferably late. When the amount of the base to be used<br><br>
'exceeds 3.0 mol relative to 1 mol of sulfonyl halide and the like, the effect corresponding to the amount used cannot be afforded, which is economically disadvantageous.<br>
The amount of sulfonyl halide and the like to be used in ^ Step C is generally 0.8 mol - 3.0 mol, preferably 1.0 mol - 2.0 mol, more preferably 1.0 mol - 1.5 mol, relative to 1 mol of compound (II) . When the amount of sulfonyl halide and the like to be used in Step C is less than 0.8 mol relative to 1 mol of compound (II), compound (II) partly remains unreacted to ' possibly lower the yield. When the amount of sulfonyl halide and the like to be used exceeds 3.0 mol relative to 1 mol of compound (II) , sulfonyl halide and the like not involved in the reaction remains in excess, which is economically disadvantageous, and unpreferably causes side reaction.<br>
The solvent to be used in Step C may be any as long as it does not inhibit the reaction. Examples thereof include methylene chloride, 1,2-dichloroethane, monochlorobenzene, 1,2-dichlorobenzene, 2-chlorotoluene, 3-chlorotoluene, 4-chlorotoluene, 2-chloro-m-xylene, 2-chloro-p-xylene, 4-chloro-o-xylene, 2,3-dichlorotoluene, 2,4-dichloxotDluene, 2,5-dichlorotoluene, 2,6-dichlorotoluene, 3,4-dichlorotoluene, monofluorobenzene, nitrobenzene, carbon disulfide, toluene, acetonitrile, propionitrile, methyl tert-butyl ether, ethylene glycol dimethyl ether, diethylene glycol dimethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran, 2-methyltetrahydrofuran, 1,3-dioxolane, 1,4-dioxane and the like, with preference given to toluene. In addition, a mixed solvent thereof may be used, and when a mixed solvent is used, the solvents may be mixed at optional ratios by a conventionally known method.<br>
The amount of the solvent to be used is generally 1 L -50 L, preferably 4 L - 30 L, more preferably 5 L - 25 L, relative to 1 kg of compound (11).<br>
While the reaction temperature in Step C depends on the<br><br>
reagent to be used and the like, the reaction of Step C generally proceeds from -30Â°C to 80Â«C, preferably from -ICC to 60*0, more preferably from -5
The compound (IV) to be obtained in Step C can be isolated and purified by a conventional method. For example, the reaction mixture is poured into water and partitioned, the organic layer is washed and filtrated, and the obtained filtrate is washed, dried and concentrated under reduced pressure to isolate compound (IV). After the isolation, for example, it is subjected to silica gel column chromatography for purification. The compound {IV) can be used for the next reaction without purification.<br>
{2R,3R)-3-(2',5'-Difluorophenyl)-3,4-epoxy-2-methanesulfonyloxybutane, which is one of the compounds (IV) obtained in step C is a novel compound and can be produced using {2R,3R)-3-(2',5'-difluorophenyl)-3,4-epoxy-2-butanol as compound (II).<br>
As the compound (II), which is a starting material in Step B and Step C, for example, that obtained in the above-mentioned Step A can be used. By the use of optically active compound (I) as the starting material of the above-mentioned Step A, an optically active compound (11) can be obtained.  In Step B or Step C, the use of an optically active compound (II) affords an optically active compound (III) or an optically active compound (IV). 4. Production method of epoxytriazole derivative (V) (Step D)<br>
The epoxytriazole derivative (V) can be obtained by, for example, reacting compound (IV) with 1,2,4-triazole in a solvent in the presence of a base. The order of addition of the reagents is not particularly limited. For example, 1,2,4-triazole and a base may be added to a solvent and then compound (IV) may be added; or 1,2,4-triazole may be added to a solvent.<br><br>
a base may be added to allow reaction and the obtained solution may be added to a solution of compound (IV) in a solvent.<br>

The amount of the base to be used in Step D, which is less than 0.3 mol relative to 1 mol of 1,2,4-triazole, is jnpreferable, because 1,2,4-triazole remains more than lecessary, which is economically disadvantageous, and 1,2,4-:riazole remaining after reaction needs to be separated. When Jie amount of the base to be used in Step D exceeds 1.3 mol relative to 1 mol of l,2,4-tria2ole, a base that does not react rith 1,2,4-triazole remains in excess, which is economically lisadvantageous, and causes a side reaction to possibly degrade iie yield and quality.<br><br>
The amount of 1,2,4-triazole to be used in Step D is generally 0.8 mol - 5.0 mol, preferably 1.0 mol - 3.0 mol, more preferably 1.1 mol - 2.0 mol, relative to 1 mol of compound (IV). When the amount of 1,2,4-triazole to be used in Step D is less than 0.8 mol relative to 1 mol of compound (IV), compound (IV) partly remains unreacted to possibly lower the yield. The amount of l,2,4-tria2ole to be used, which exceeds 5,0 mol relative to 1 mol of compound (IV), is unpreferable, because 1,2,4-triazole not involved in the reaction remains in excess, which is economically disadvantageous, and 1,2,4-triazole remaining after reaction needs to be separated.<br>
To promote the reaction in Step D, for example, a phase-transfer catalyst such as tetraalkyl ammoniiam salts (e.g., octadecyl trimethyl ammonium bromide, tetrabutyl ammonium sulfate, tetrabutyl ammonium bromide, tetrabutyl ammonium iodide, tetrabutyl airanonium chloride and the like), trialkyl benzyl ammonium salts (e.g., benzyl trimethyl ammonium bromide, benzyl trimethyl ammonium chloride, benzyl triethyl ammonixom chloride and the like); and the like may be added.<br>
The solvent to be used in Step D may he any as long as it does not inhibit the reaction. Examples thereof include ethers such as THF, methyl tert-butyl ether, 1,4-dioxane, diethylene glycol dimethyl ether (diglyme), ethylene glycol dimethyl ether, 1,3-dioxolane, 2-methyltetrahydrofuran and the like; aprotic polar solvents such as DMF, DMAc, DMSO, sulfolane, NMP, DMI, HMPA, methyl isobutyl ketone, methyl ethyl ketone, acetone, cyclohexanone, 3-pentanone, nitrobenzene, carbon disulfide, acetonitrile, propionitrile and the like; halogenated solvents such as methylene chloride, 1,2-dichloroethane, monochlorobenzene, 1,2-dichlorobenzene, 2-chlorotoluene, 3-ch1orotoluene, 4-chlorotoluene, 2-chloro-m-xylene, 2-chloro-p-xylene, 4-chloro-o-xylene, 2,3-dichlorotoluene, 2,4-dichlorotoluene, 2,5-dichlorotoluene, 2,6-<br><br>
dichlorotoluene, 3,4-dichlorotoluene, raonofluorobenzene and the like; aromatic hydrocarbon such as toluene, xylene and the like; and the like, or a mixed solvent thereof may be used. When a mixed solvent is used, the solvents may be mixed at optional ratios by a conventionally known method.<br>
The amount of the solvent to be used is generally 1 L -50 L, preferably 3 L - 30 L, more preferably 5 L - 25 L, relative to 1 kg of compound (IV).<br>
While the reaction temperature in Step D depends on the reagent to be used and the like, the reaction of Step D generally proceeds from -20Â°C to 150Â°C, preferably 0Â°C - 100Â°C, more preferably 20Â°C - 90Â°C, generally for 0.5 hr - 24 hr, preferably 1 hr - 10 hr.<br>
The epoxytriazole derivative {V) to be obtained in Step D can be isolated and purified by a conventional method. For example, the reaction mixture is poured into water and partitioned, the organic layer is washed and filtrated, and the obtained filtrate is washed, dried and concentrated under reduced pressure to isolate epoxytriazole derivative (V), After the isolation, for example, it can be subjected to silica gel column chromatography and recrystallization for purification. The epoxytriazole derivative (V) can be also used for the reaction to lead to the objective pharmaceutical product compound without purification.<br>
As the compound (IV) , which is a starting material in Step D, for example, that obtained in the above-mentioned Step C can be used. By the use of optically active compound (II) as the starting material of the above-mentioned Step C, an optically active compound (IV) can be obtained.  In Step D, the use of an optically active compound (IV) affords an optically active epoxytriazole derivative (V).<br>
The epoxytriazole derivative (V) can be led to a triazole compound useful as an anti-fungal agent, according to<br><br>
a method described in, for example, JP-A-4-356471, JP-A-5-<br>

Sodium hydride (60% dispersion in oil, 0.68 g, 17.0 mmol) was added to dimethyl sulfoxide (40 mL) and<br>
trimethyloxosulfonium iodide (3.91 g, 17.8 mmol) was added in small portions at 15 - 20'='C.    After generation of hydrogen stopped, a solution (8 mL) of (2R)-2',4'-difluoro-2-(3,4,5,6-tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-yloxy)propiophenone (4.0 g, 14.8 mmol) in dimethyl sulfoxide was added dxopwise, and the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 1 hr. After the completion of the reaction, the reaction mixture was added dropwise to water (120 mL), and the mixture was extracted 3 times with ethyl acetate (120 mL, 80 mL X 2). The layers extracted with ethyl acetate were mixed, washed twice with saturated brine (40 mL) and dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. After filtration, the filtrate (ethyl acetate solution) was concentrated. The obtained concentrate was subjected to silica gel column<br><br>
chromatography (SiOz, 50 g) and eluted with n-heptane - ethyl acetate (10:1). The objective fraction was concentrated and a mixture of mostly the title compound and a diastereomer thereof, (2R,3S)-compound, as a pale-yellow oil (3.84 g).<br>
The protecting group of the obtained pale-yellow oil was removed by the same method as in Reference Example 1 and analyzed under the same HPLC conditions as in Example 1. As a result, the ratio of the title compound and a diastereomer thereof, (2R,3S)-compound, was 4:1.<br>
As shown by the above results, the reaction of the compound (I) not protected with trimethyloxosulfonium salt and the like surprisingly proceeded easily to give compound (II). When compound (1) was in an optically active form, induction of racemization in this reaction was worried, but racemization was not observed in most cases. As shown in Comparative Example 1 and Examples 1 and 2, the use of compound (I) resulted in strikingly improved diastereoselectivity as compared to the use of a compound protected by tetrahydropyranyl group. As shown in Example 4, moreover, epoxytriazole derivative (V) could be synthesized efficiently from compound (IV), which was produced by substituting the hydroxyl group in compound (II) for a leaving group,<br>
