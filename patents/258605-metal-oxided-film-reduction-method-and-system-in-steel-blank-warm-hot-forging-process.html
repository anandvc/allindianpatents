PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is  to be  performed : -<br><br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
(a) Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention is related to a method of metal forging process, and more particularly, to a method to reduce development of oxide film in a steel blank hot forging process and system thereof.<br>
(b) Description of the Prior Art:<br>
Forging has been one of the primary methods for metal modeling since the ancient time. Today, metal parts or finished products for meeting its purpose of fitting to an end product must be processed into the shape desired. Mass production using standardized machines and models is the production mode for the forging industry to maintain its competition strength.<br>
The steel refinery sector included in the upper stream of the metal forging industry has adopted a constituent blast furnace and converter heating up operation. A blank is made with the iron sand and coal as raw materials, and the forging plant must process the blank into a size demanded by the customer. The forging process depending on the nature of the material is divided into three methods, respectively, cold forging, warm forging, and hot forging.<br>
A metal forging process, specifically, a steel forging process generally includes heating, rough forging, refine forging, and surface cleaning procedures and usually done in shop with a consistent operation procedure. Heating up the black is one of the most important works in the forging process. Steel forging is related to a hot work. To make the blank to provide plasticity required, the blank must be heated up before a press forging process. Taking the hot forging and warm forging for examples, the black must be heated up to 900-1250 before formation, These two forging processes have been used for a long time and provide the advantage of facilitating formation without being subject to dimensional restriction. In either forging, a heating system must be provided. Currently, fuel oil, gas, and electric power are generally used for heating purpose.  Wherein, most of the high frequency<br><br><br>
heating furnace is mostly used for heating with electric power. The high frequency heating furnace features fast heating speed, and simple in construction to allow automated production and therefore is comprehensively applied as the heating system for metal forging formation at high temperature. The blank after having been heated up is vulnerable to create oxidized film and carbon peeling from the surface after contacting the air. If the surface of the blank is not completely cleaned, oxidized film present on the surface of the blank can be easily pressed into the surface layer of the finished product during the forging process. Therefore, each piece of blank must go through procedures of heating, surface cleaning, press forging, and trimming. Removing the oxidized film is therefore a very critical procedure. However, a forging plant may process thousands and even tens of thousand work pieces each day, excessive oxidized films from the blanks may cause the following problems that warrant improvement:<br>
1.	Whereas the oxidized film on the blank will easily fall into the heating furnace and build up therein; and transfer pipes in the heating furnace may be blocked by accumulated oxidized films.<br>
2.	Residual oxidized film on the surface of the blank after incomplete cleaning process will cause relative damage to the molds in the course of forging.<br>
3.	Oxidized film on the blank is a refuse to be disposed of; and excessive oxidized films result in problems of environmental pollution and increased costs.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The primary purpose of the present invention is to provide a method of hot or warm forging process of steel blank that is capable of reducing development of oxidized film. To achieve the purpose, the present invention applies inert gas, e.g., nitrogen, argon, neon, or helium as a protective gas to respectively spray through an inert gas input device into the processes of blank heating, surface cleaning, and delivering to a transfer unit to reduce development of oxidized film on the blank.<br><br><br>
Another purpose of the present invention is to provide a system for reducing development of oxidized film in the method described in the primary purpose above. The inert gas input device is connected through the heating space in an electric heating furnace, and the heated inert gas is sprayed through a nozzle into the heating space for saving power consumption by the electric heating furnace.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Referring to Fig. 1, in a flow path of a process of a preferred embodiment of the present invention that reduces development of oxidized film in the course of warm/hot forging process on a steel blank, the blank 1 precut into a size as designed is placed in a feeder 2 to enter along a route present for the feeder 2 into a heat space 31 in an electric heating furnace 3. The electric heating furnace 3 in the preferred embodiment is related to a high frequency heating oven.  A preheated inert gas, e.g.,<br><br><br>
nitrogen, argon, neon, or helium is imported into the heating space 31. As also illustrated in Figs. 2 and 5, the inert gas is discharged from the heating space 31 along an inlet port 311 and an outlet port 312. The inert gas is generated by an inert gas transfer device 8. Surface of the blank 1 is cleaned by passing through a decarbonizing device. The inert gas transfer device 8 sprays the inert gas not yet heated to the blank 1 through a nozzle 8a from a gas pipe 81a to keep air from contacting the blank 1.<br>
As illustrated in Fig. 3, the blank 1 passes through a transfer unit 5. The transfer unit 5 related to a conveyor belt in the preferred embodiment is located in a closed space 51. An upper surface of the closed space 51 is connected to a gas pipe 81b and is further connected to multiple gas nozzles 8b so to fill the closed space 51 with inert gas. The blank 1 enters into a press forging device 6 to be press forged. In the preferred embodiment, the press forging device relates to a press forging machine operating oil molding formation. As illustrated in Fig. 4, the press forging device 6 is provided with an upper mold 6a and a lower mold 6b, a lubricant 61 added with inert gas to be sprayed on both of the upper mold 6a and the lower mold 6b I the course of press forging by the press forging device 6. Later the press forged blank 1 is delivered to a finishing device (not illustrated) where the blank 1 will be trimmed, i.e., burrs removed to become a finished product. Refer to Fig. 6 for a finished product using the process of the present invention, and to Fig. 7, another finished product using the process of the prior art.<br>
Now referring to Figs. 2 and 5, the inert gas transfer device 8 is connected through the heating space 31 of the electric heating furnace. The inert gas transfer device 8 defines a gas to be heated by passing through a gas pipe 81c connected to the electric heating oven 3 and at least a nozzle 8c disposed at where faces the heating space 31. The inlet port 311, the outlet port 312, and a main unit 32 containing a heat source are disposed to the electric heating furnace. The gas pipe 81c of the inert gas transfer device 8 passes the main unit 32 of the electric heating furnace. The gas pipe 81c containing insulation and heat transfer material, e.g., ceramic directs the heated inert<br><br><br>
gas from the nozzle 8c into a preset location in the heating space 31 to inject the inert gas, which is discharged through the inlet port 311 and the outlet port 312. In the preferred embodiment, the electric heating furnace is related to a high frequency heating furnace, and the heating space 31 is comprised of copper pipes, coils, and round ceramic pipe.<br>
Accordingly, the inert gas is sprayed into the heating space of the heating furnace in the present invention thus to force the air to be discharged for preventing development of oxidized film on the blank to be heated. The present invention provides a number of advantages including prevention the heating furnace from being blocked due to accumulation of oxidized film or decarbonized layer. In comparing to the prior art, the present invention allows skip the cleaning process for the blank before being press forged thus to extend service life of steel brush. Furthermore, the damage to the mold by the blank in the forging process is minimized due to reduction of the oxidized film thus to extend service life of the mold and upgrade production capacity of the product of work piece. The most important advantage of the present invention is that a reduction of 90% oxidized film can be achieved for the blank.<br><br><br>
