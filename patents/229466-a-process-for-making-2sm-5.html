				<td>IN-SITU ZSM-5 SYNTHESIS<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to the production of<br>
crystalline aluminosilicate ZSM-5, and more specifically,<br>
to improved methods for rapidly and efficiently producing<br>
in-situ ZSM-5 crystals from preformed kaolin microspheres<br>
and without organic templates or ZSM-5 seeding crystals.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Zeolites are crystalline aluminosilicates which have<br>
a uniform crystal structure characterized by a large<br>
number of regular small cavities interconnected by a large<br>
number of even smaller rectangular channels. It was<br>
discovered that, by virtue of this structure consisting of<br>
a network of interconnected uniformly sized cavities and<br>
channels, crystalline zeolites are able to accept for<br>
absorption molecules having sizes below a certain well<br>
defined value whilst rejecting molecules of larger size,<br>
and for this reason they have come to be known as<br>
"molecular sieves." This characreristic structure also<br>
gives them catalytic properties, especially for certain<br>
types of hydrocarbon conversions.<br>
The ZSM family of zeolites is well known and their<br>
preparation and properties have been extensively<br><br>
described. Thus, for example, one type of the ZSM family<br>
or zeolites is that known as ZSM-5. The crystalline<br>
aluminosilicate zeolite known as ZSM-5 is particularly<br>
described in U.S. Pat. No. 3,702,886, the disclosure of<br>
which is incorporated herein by reference. ZSM-5<br>
crystalline aluminosilicate is characterized by a silica-<br>
to-alumina mole ratio of greater than 5 and more precisely<br>
in the anhydrous state by the general formula:<br>
[0. 9Â±0.2M2/nO:Al2O3:&gt;5SiO2]<br>
wherein M having a valence n is selected from the group<br>
consisting of a mixture of alkali metal cations and organo<br>
ammonium cations, particularly a mixture of sodium and<br>
tetraalkyl ammonium cations, the alkyl groups of which<br>
preferably contain 2 to 5 carbon atoms. The term<br>
"anhydrous" as used in the above context means that<br>
molecular water is not included in the formula. In<br>
general, the mole ratio of Si02 to Al2O3 for a ZSM-5 zeolite<br>
can vary widely. For example, ZSM-5 zeolites can be<br>
aluminum-free in which the ZSM-5 is formed from an alkali<br>
mixture of silica containing only impurities of aluminum.<br>
All zeolites characterized as ZSM-5, however, will have<br>
the characteristic X-ray diffraction pattern set forth in<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 3,702,88 6 regardless of the aluminum content<br>
of the zeolite.<br><br>
Based on the unique pore structure of ZSM-5, this<br>
zeolite can be applied extensively as a catalyst material<br>
to various processes. Zeolite ZSM-5 has been shown to be<br>
a particularly useful catalyst in reactions involving<br>
aromatic compounds, with emphasis on those having a single<br>
carbocycle. Thus ZSM-5 exhibits unique selectivity in the<br>
conversion of olefins, naphthenes, alcohols, ethers and<br>
alkanes into aromatic compounds and in such reactions as<br>
isomerization, alkylation, dealkylation and<br>
transalkylation of aromatics. That favorable influence on<br>
aromatic conversion reactions is found also in the forms<br>
of ZSM-5 in which another metal appears in isomorphic<br>
substitution for aluminum, as described in U.S. Patent<br>
4,163,028. ZSM-5 has also been extensively applied in<br>
catalytic cracking and catalytic dewaxing. When ZSM-5 is<br>
used in catalytic cracking of petroleum, enhancement of<br>
gasoline octane is achieved. Accordingly, ZSM-5 has been<br>
used as an additive to other cracking catalysts, e.g.<br>
zeolite Y, to improve gasoline octane and LPG yields.<br>
The use of ZSM-5 type zeolite in conjunction with a<br>
zeolite cracking catalyst of the X or Y faujasite variety<br>
is described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,894,931; 3,894,933; and<br>
3,894,934. The two former patents disclose the use of<br>
ZSM-5 type zeolite in amounts up to and about 5 to 10<br>
weight percent; the latter patent discloses the weight<br><br>
ratio of ZSM-5 type zeolite to large pore size crystalline<br>
zeolite within the range of 1:10 to 3:1.<br>
The addition of a separate additive catalyst<br>
comprising one or more members of the ZSM-5 type has been<br>
found to be extremely efficient as an octane and LPG yield<br>
improver when used in very small amounts in conjunction<br>
with a conventional cracking catalyst. Thus, in U.S. Pat.<br>
No. 4,309,179, it was found that only 0.1 to 0.5 weight<br>
percent of a ZSM-5 type catalyst added to a conventional<br>
cracking catalyst under conventional cracking operations<br>
could increase octane by about 1 to 3 RON+0 (research<br>
octane number without lead).<br>
Generally, the octane gain of a ZSM-5 containing<br>
cracking catalyst is associated with gasoline (C5+) yield<br>
decrease and correspondingly higher yields of C3 and C4<br>
gaseous products. As the freshly added ZSM-5 undergoes<br>
hydrothermal deactivation, the octane enhancement is<br>
reduced and additional ZSM-5 must be added to maintain the<br>
desired octane level.<br>
Crystalline aiuminosilicates in general have been<br>
prepared from mixtures of oxides including sodium oxide,<br>
alumina, silica and water. More recently clays and<br>
coprecipitated aluminosilicate gels, in the dehydrated<br>
form, have been used as sources of alumina and silica in<br>
reaction systems. In some instances of synthetic<br><br>
faujasite synthesis from clay, the zeolitic product is in<br>
the form of an aggregate.<br>
U.S. Patent 4,091,007 teaches a method of preparing<br>
ZSM-5 from preformed extrudates without losing the shape<br>
of the extrudates upon crystallization. The extrudate<br>
contains a mixture of silica sources such as Ludox and<br>
sodium silicate, and kaolin calcined at 1800Â°F. In cases<br>
where it contains raw kaolin, the extrudate has been<br>
calcined in the temperature range between 1700Â°F and<br>
2000Â°F. Organic templates, such as tetramethylammonium<br>
chloride, tetrapropylammonium bromide, tri-n-propylamine,<br>
and n-propyl bromide, were used during crystallization in<br>
the examples. Extradates containing up to 60% of grown<br>
ZSM-5 were produced. A similar process is described in<br>
U.S. 5,558,851.<br>
EP Publication No. 0,068,817 reveals a method of<br>
making ZSM-5 from acid-leached metakaolin. Metakaolin is<br>
treated with a strong acid, e.g., hydrochloric acid,<br>
sulphuric acid, and nitric acid, and crthophosphoric acid<br>
to extract at least part of the aluminum oxide content of<br>
the metakaolin and provide the material with a SiO2/Al2O3<br>
(mol) ratio in the range of from 10-200:1. In the<br>
presence of a quaternary compound such as<br>
tetrapropylammonium hydroxide, the acid-treated metakaolin<br>
reacts with NaOH to provide ZSM-5.<br><br>
U.S. Patent 6,004,527 teaches the synthesis of ZSM-5<br>
from preformed silica-only microspheres. Aluminum and<br>
sodium sources were added via incipient wetness<br>
impregnation using the respective nitrate salts.<br>
Tetrapropylammonium hydroxide was used as a directing<br>
agent. ZSM-5 crystallinity of the product was 25% and the<br>
particle shape and size of the silica microsphere were<br>
retained in the product.<br>
U.S. Patent 4,522,705 relates to a method of making<br>
ZSM-5 additive catalyst prepared by in-situ<br>
crystallization of a clay aggregate. Clay microspheres<br>
were treated with an aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide<br>
and organic template such as n-propylamine. In a<br>
variation, the preformed microspheres were formed<br>
containing crystalline ZSM-5 as seeds. Crystallization<br>
was carried out in the presence of NaOH and n-propylamine.<br>
Seeding as a means for inducing crystallization is a<br>
very old technique. In the art of zeolite manufacture,<br>
various patents describe the use of seeding to induce the<br>
rapid crystallization of zeolites. Various patents<br>
describing the manufacture of zeolite crystals by seeding<br>
with a zeolite include: United Kingdom Pat. No. 1,297,256,<br>
in making ZSM-4; U.S. Pat. No. 3,247,194, in making ZK-5;<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 3,73 3,3 91, in making faujasite; and U.S.<br>
Pat. No. 4,007,253, in making faujasite in which the seed<br><br>
is not the same as the product. Patents disclosing the<br>
formation of zeolites by seeding with other<br>
aluminosilicates include: United Kingdom Patent No.<br>
1,117,5 68, in making ZSM-4; United Kingdom Patent No.<br>
1,160,463, in making faujasite; U.S. Pat. No. 3,578,398,<br>
in making a zeolite similar to offretite; and U.S. Pat.<br>
No. 3,947,482, in making various zeolites. It is to be<br>
understood that the mentioned preceding patents are not an<br>
exhaustive list of all patents which discuss forming<br>
zeolite crystals by seeding.<br>
EP Publication No. 0,156,595 teaches in-situ ZSM-5<br>
synthesis from extrudates and microspheres in the absence<br>
of any organic compounds of nitrogen and phosphorus. 5%<br>
ZSM-5 is included as seeds in the preformed particles.<br>
The seeds employed are said to be the same as the zeolite<br>
intended to grow. In examples where there is no ZSM-5<br>
seed presence, no ZSM-5 is crystallized.<br>
U.S. Patent 5,145,659 discloses the synthesis of ZSM-<br>
5 from a preformed matrix such as clay extrudates or spray<br>
dried microspheres containing a source of silica, alumina,<br>
alkali metal, or mixtures thereof. The preformed matrix<br><br>
is enriched in silica by precipitation of silicate from a<br>
solution of a silicate source and addition of a zeolite<br>
synthesis reaction mixture which contains an organic<br>
templating agent and/or ZSM-5 seeds. No ZSM-5 is<br><br>
crystallized in examples where there are no ZSM-5 seeding<br>
crystals or organic template present.<br>
U.S. Patent 6,261,534 discloses a zeolite<br>
crystallization method that comprises combining a<br>
template-free reaction mixture containing a source of<br>
silicon oxide and aluminum oxide and sufficient water to<br>
shape the mixture into particles. Zeolites such as ZSM-5<br>
are crystallized within the shaped particles while heating<br>
the reaction mixture in the absence of an external liquid<br>
phase. While there is disclosure that ZSM-5 can be<br>
crystallized without the addition of seeds, ZSM-5 crystals<br>
are used in the only examples disclosed.<br>
U.S. Patent 5,232,675 discloses the synthesis of a<br>
rare earth-containing high-silica zeolite having pentasil-<br>
type structure. The reaction mixture is free of organic<br>
compounds of nitrogen and phosphorus. Water glass,<br>
aluminum phosphate, and inorganic acid are used as raw<br>
materials, and REY or REX zeolite are used as seeds.<br>
Reaction data suggests that upon steam deactivation, the<br>
rare-earth containing ZSM-5 have good activity maintenance<br>
as compared to ZSM-5 without rare earth.<br>
Chinese patent publications CN 1,194,943A and CN -<br>
1,057,067c disclose a process for synthesizing molecular<br>
sieve ZSM-5 with use of NaY mother liquid as raw material<br>
and includes the acid deposition of silica and alumina,<br><br>
spray drying to obtain microspheres, mixing the<br>
microspheres with NaOH, water and optionally crystal seed<br>
of molecular sieve, and hydrothermal crystallizing.<br>
Since the 1960's, most commercial fluid catalytic<br>
cracking catalysts have contained zeolites as an active<br>
component. Such catalysts have taken the form of small<br>
particles, called microspheres, containing both an active<br>
zeolite component and a non-zeolite component in the form<br>
of a high alumina, silica-alumina matrix.<br>
In prior art fluid catalytic cracking catalysts, the<br>
active zeolitic component is incorporated into the<br>
microspheres of the catalyst by one of two general<br>
techniques. In one technique, the zeolitic component is<br>
crystallized and then incorporated into microspheres in a<br>
separate step. In the second technique, the in-situ<br>
technique, microspheres are first formed and the zeolitic<br>
component is then crystallized in the microspheres<br>
themselves to provide microspheres containing both<br>
zeolitic and non-zeolitic components.<br>
For many years a significant proportion of commercial<br>
FCC catalysts used throughout the world have been made by<br>
in-situ synthesis from precursor microspheres containing<br>
kaolin that had been calcined at different severities<br>
prior to formation into microspheres by spray drying.<br><br>
For example, commonly assigned U.S. Patent No.<br>
4,493,902, the teachings of which are incorporated herein<br>
by cross-reference, discloses novel fluid cracking<br>
catalysts comprising attrition-resistant, high zeolitic<br>
content, catalytically active microspheres containing more<br>
than about 40%, preferably 50-70% by weight Y faujasite<br>
and methods for making such catalysts by crystallizing<br>
more than about 40% sodium Y zeolite in porous<br>
microspheres composed of a mixture of metakaolin (kaolin<br>
calcined to undergo a strong endothermic reaction<br>
associated with dehydroxylation) and kaolin calcined under<br>
conditions more severe than those used to convert kaolin<br>
to metakaolin, i.e., kaolin calcined to undergo the<br>
characteristic kaolin exothermic reaction, sometimes<br>
referred to as the spinel form of calcined kaolin. In a<br>
preferred embodiment, the microspheres containing the two<br>
forms of calcined kaolin are immersed in an alkaline<br>
sodium silicate solution, which is heated, preferably<br>
until the maximum obtainable amount of Y faujasite is<br>
crystallized in the microspheres.<br>
In carrying out the invention described in the '902<br>
patent, the microspheres composed of kaolin calcined to<br>
undergo the exotherm and metakaolin are reacted with a<br>
caustic enriched sodium silicate solution in the presence<br>
of a crystallization initiator (seeds) to convert silica<br><br>
and alumina in the microspheres into synthetic sodium<br>
faujasite (zeolite Y). The microspheres are separated<br>
from the sodium silicate mother liquor, ion-exchanged with<br>
rare earth, ammonium ions or both to form rare earth or<br>
various known stabilized forms of catalysts. The<br>
technology of the '902 patent provides means for achieving<br>
a desirable and unique combination of high zeolite content<br>
associated with high activity, good selectivity and<br>
thermal stability, as well as attrition-resistance.<br>
While the prior art as discussed above has attempted<br>
to form in-situ ZSM-5 from clay aggregates, including<br>
aggregates formed from kaolin, the zeolite-forming process<br>
has included the addition of organic templates typically<br>
used in ZSM-5 synthesis and/or required use of ZSM-5 seed<br>
crystals. The need to use either of these materials<br>
greatly undercuts the economic advantage of using kaolin<br>
aggregates as a raw material in zeolite synthesis by the<br>
in-situ method.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
In accordance with the present invention, synthesis<br>
of in-situ ZSM-5 microspheres is achieved using kaolin<br>
microspheres with a zeolite Y seed solution in a reaction<br>
system otherwise free of organic templating materials and<br>
ZSM-5 seeding crystals. In-situ ZSM-5 synthesis from<br><br>
kaolin microspheres is achieved by minimizing the amount<br>
of the reactive alumina in the kaolin microsphere by<br>
calcination at elevated temperatures. Mixing the calcined<br>
kaolin microspheres with a silica source and a seed<br>
solution used for in-situ FCC Y synthesis and heating<br>
results in growth of ZSM-5 crystals on the microsphere.<br>
The in-situ ZSM-5 has use as an FCC additive and catalyst<br>
for fine chemical processes such as organic compound<br>
manufacture.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING<br>
Figure 1 is an XRD pattern of an as crystallized ZSM-<br>
5-containing microsphere formed by the process of this<br>
invention.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Preparation of the fluid cracking additive catalyst,<br>
in accordance with this invention, involves an initial<br>
step of preparing microspheres comprising hydrous kaolin,<br>
metakaolin, kaolin calcined undergone through<br>
characteristic exothermic reaction, or mixtures of the<br>
kaolin forms. Optionally, colloidal silica, silica sol or<br>
sodium silicate binder can be added. The microspheres are<br>
calcined to convert any hydrous kaolin and merakaolin that<br>
may be present to spinel and/or mullite. In case where<br><br>
hydrous kaolin and metakaolin are not present, high<br>
calcination temperature may not be required. It is<br>
important that the microspheres prior to crystallization<br>
contain only a minimum of reactive alumina. Accordingly,<br>
the calcined microspheres will have a metakaolin content<br>
that is less than 10 wt. %. Preferably the metakaolin<br>
content in the calcined microspheres is less than 5 wt. %.<br>
Spinel and mullite contain little reactive alumina, which<br>
is determined by the amount of alumina solublized in a 1/1<br>
hydrochloric acid/water solution following a thirty-minute<br>
digestion at 115Â°C.<br>
The initial microspheres are made by spray drying a<br>
feed mixture containing hydrated kaolin, metakaolin, or<br>
kaolin calcined through the characteristic exothermic<br>
reaction and optionally colloidal silica and/or silica sol<br>
and/or sodium silicate binder. Mixtures of the kaolin<br>
forms can also be used. Enhancing the silica level in the<br>
preformed microsphere by including silica-rich components<br>
or using more silicate binder increases the overall<br>
reactive SiO2/Al2O3 ratio, resulting in an increased level<br>
of crystallized ZSM-5. If a silicate binder is used such<br>
as sodium silicate, and if desired, sodium in the<br>
microspheres can be washed out at low pH, e.g., pH of 3.<br>
The spray dried microspheres are washed and then calcined<br>
to form precursor porous microspheres in which any of the<br><br>
hydrous kaolin and metakaolin is converted to spinel or<br>
mullite. The amount of metakaolin present in the calcined<br>
precursor microspheres needs to be minimized, i.e. less<br>
than 10%, to provide the desired reactive SiO2/Al2O3 ratio<br>
and allow formation of ZSM-5 crystals. Typically, the<br>
calcined precursor microspheres will have a BET surface<br>
area of less than 200 m2/g.<br>
In an alternative method of forming a microsphere<br>
with a reduced reactive alumina content, the process of<br>
acid leaching a metakaolin as described in EP 068,817 can<br>
be used. According to the process as described therein, a<br>
method of manufacturing a crystalline zeolite of the ZSM<br>
family comprises the initial step of treating an<br>
aluminosilicate such as metakaolin with a strong acid at a<br>
temperature and for a time sufficient to extract at least<br>
part of the aluminum oxide content of the aluminosilicate<br>
and increase the molar ratio of SiO2:Al2O3 in the<br>
aluminosilicate to a value not less than 10:1. The acid<br>
used preferably has a pKa value not greater than 2 and most<br>
preferably has a pKa value of less than 0. Suitable acids<br>
include hydrochloric acid, sulphuric acid, nitric acid,<br>
and orthophosphoric acid. The acid should be used at a<br>
concentration of at least 2M, preferably at least 5Â¥Â±, and<br>
most preferably at least 7M. The optimum acid<br>
concentration depends upon the weight ratio of acid<br><br>
solution to dry aluminosilicate and upon the type of acid<br>
used and thus the nature of the aluminum salt formed and<br>
its solubility in the acid solution. The weight ratio of<br>
acid solution to dry aluminosilicate is preferably at<br>
least 5:1. The acid treatment is preferably performed at<br>
a temperature in the range of from 50Â°C to 120Â°C for at<br>
least 1 hour, and under conditions such that the molar<br>
ratio of SiO2:Al2O3 in the acid-treated aluminosilicate is<br>
in the range 10-200:1. Usually, after the acid treatment<br>
the molar ratio of SiO2:Al2O3 in the aluminosilicate is in<br>
the range 10-50:1.<br>
The precursor microspheres, having a minimum of<br>
reactive alumina achieved either by high temperature<br>
calcination of kaolin or acid leaching of metakaolin, are<br>
reacted with zeolite Y seed solution and an alkaline<br>
sodium silicate solution. The zeolite Y seed solution is<br>
one intended for use in initiating crystallization of<br>
synthetic crystalline zeolite of the Y-type. ZSM-5 seeds<br>
are not used in the reaction.<br>
Preparation of zeolite Y seed solution While it is<br>
useful to use crystallized zeolite Y seeds in this<br>
invention, the zeolite Y seed solution is most usefully<br>
obtained by processes disclosed in U.S. 4,493,902 and U.S.<br>
1,631,262, the entire contents of which are herein<br>
incorporated by reference. As disclosed in U.S. 4,631,262,<br><br>
appropriate quantities of sodium silicate, sodium<br>
aluminate and sodium hydroxide are mixed, preferably in a<br>
controlled manner, hereinafter described, heating the<br>
resulting mixture for a time sufficient for the seeds to<br>
mature but insufficient for cloudiness to occur, and<br>
thereafter adding to the matured solution a portion of the<br>
sodium silicate reactant that would normally be included<br>
in the reaction slurry including the porous microspheres<br>
of calcined kaolin. The sodium silicate added to the<br>
matured seed solution is preferably at ambient temperature<br>
when it is added to the solution. The amount of sodium<br>
silicate solution added to the solution of matured clear<br>
seeds is effective to result in a seed solution which will<br>
maintain its clarity when aged for 4 8 hours or longer<br>
(without cooling). In effect, enrichment of a clear<br>
solution of matured seeds with sodium silicate functions<br>
to quench the undesirable reaction(s) that may take place<br>
and which would result in undesired cloudiness. The seed<br>
solution is amorphous and does not exhibit any detectable<br>
crystallinity by x-ray diffraction.<br>
A solution of matured seeds which has become clouded<br>
or gelled can be made clear by adding additional sodium<br>
silicate solution, the amount of sodium silicate solution<br>
being effective to assure that the previously clouded or<br>
gelled solution will maintain its clarity when aged for 48<br><br><br>
hours or longer without cooling. In this case, the sodium<br>
silicate enriched seed mixture is optionally, but<br>
preferably, heated and then permitted to age at ambient<br>
temperature. Heating after addition of sodium silicate is<br>
preferred because clarification will take place in a<br>
shorter time.<br>
As used herein, the terms "solution of zeolite seed"<br>
and "zeolite initiator" shall include any aqueous solution<br>
containing silica, alumina and soda that either allows a<br>
zeolite Y crystallization process that would not occur in<br>
the absence of the seed material or shortens significantly<br>
the zeolite Y crystallization process that would occur in<br>
the absence of the seed material. Again, the zeolite Y<br>
seed solution as described above does not contain<br>
crystalline zeolite Y.<br>
Recommended seed solutions have the following<br>
composition on a molar basis prior to adding sodium<br>
silicate diluent as shown in Table 1.<br><br><br>
The preferred materials used to prepare the seed<br>
solution are sodium silicate of approximate 2/1 SiO2/Na2O<br>
molar ratio, preferably a concentrated (44%) by-product of<br>
catalyst manufacture analyzing about 14.8 wt % Na2O, 28.6%<br>
SiO2, the balance being water (See U.S. Pat. No.<br>
4,493,902); a 25% (wt) solution of NaOH and Nalco 2372<br>
sodium aluminate solution (typically analyzing 18.3% Na2O,<br>
19.9% Al2O3) . The composition of the seed solution on a<br>
weight basis is as shown in Table 2.<br><br>
The ingredients used to form the solution of seeds<br>
may be heated at temperatures in the range of about 70Â°F<br>
to 120Â°F, preferably about 100Â°F, during the mixing step<br>
and may be maintained at temperatures in the range of<br>
about 80Â°F to 120Â°F, preferably about 100Â°F, to mature the<br>
seeds. At temperatures appreciably below 100Â°F, the time<br>
required for the seeds to mature may be too long for<br><br>
effective commercial practice. At temperatures<br>
appreciably above 100Â°F, zeolite growth may be impaired.<br>
The composition of the seed solution after quenching<br>
by addition of sodium silicate will depend on the amount<br>
of silicate added and the chemical composition of the<br>
sodium silicate solution.<br>
Compositions of seed solutions after dilution with<br>
sodium silicate appear below in Table 3.<br><br>
As disclosed in U.S. 4,493,902, zeolite initiator may<br>
be provided from a number of sources. For example, the<br>
zeolite initiator may comprise recycled fines produced<br>
during the crystallization process itself. Other zeolite<br>
initiators that may be used include fines produced during<br>
the crystallization process of another zeolite product or<br>
an amorphous zeolite initiator in a sodium silicate<br>
solution. As used herein, "amorphous zeolite initiator"<br>
shall mean a zeolite initiator that exhibits no detectable<br>
crystallinity by x-ray diffraction.<br><br>
The amorphous zeolite initiator may be prepared by<br>
mixing solutions of sodium silicate and sodium aluminate<br>
and aging the mixture for a time and at a temperature<br>
sufficient to form the amorphous zeolite initiator. Good<br>
amorphous zeolite initiators for internal seeding have<br>
been made by aging a mixture having the molar ratios<br>
indicated below for 24 or more hours at 100Â°F.<br><br>
Best results have been obtained when a sodium<br>
silicate solution was added rapidly to a sodium aluminate<br>
solution, with rapid mixing, or when the two solutions<br>
were simultaneously added to a mixer, with rapid mixing.<br>
When the sodium silicate and sodium aluminate<br>
solutions are mixed, the resulting mixture is clear.<br>
However, after the mixture has been aged at 100Â°F for<br>
about 24 hours or longer, it begins to acquire a cloudy<br>
appearance. It is preferred that the mixture comprising<br>
zeolite initiator used for internal seeding have such a<br>
cloudy appearance because the use of a clear mixture<br>
comprising zeolite initiator can result in slower zeolite<br>
growth during the crystallization. In contrast, it is<br>
preferred that the mixture containing amorphous zeolite<br>
initiator used for external seeding be clear.<br><br>
The level of silicate added to the mixture of<br>
calcined microspheres and any zeolite seed solution or<br>
zeolite initiator should be such as to provide in the<br>
reactor a silica to reactive alumina molar ratio or<br>
SiO2/Al2O3 ratio of at least 20, preferably at least 30.<br>
Reactive alumina is determined as described above. The pH<br>
of the reaction solution should be less than 14 and at<br>
least have a pH of 10.5. The pH of the solution can be<br>
adjusted by the addition of an acid. Suitable acids<br>
include hydrochloric acid, sulphuric acid, nitric acid,<br>
and orthophosphoric acid. Reaction generally takes place<br>
in an autoclave under agitation at a temperature of from<br>
130-240Â°C, preferably 150-200Â°C, for 5-30 hours,<br>
preferably from 10-25 hours.<br>
After the crystallization reaction, the product is<br>
filtered from the mother liquor and washed with water.<br>
The microspheres typically contain at least 20 wt %<br>
zeolite ZSM-5 crystallized therein. Zeolite ZSM-5 content<br>
of from 20 to about 65 percent by weight can be achieved<br>
with this invention.<br>
The following examples illustrate the invention and<br>
are not intended to limit the scope of the invention<br>
solely to the embodiments set forth therein.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br><br>
Table 4 gives the formulation of a clear zeolite Y<br>
seed solution used in the present invention.<br><br><br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
In the following example, microspheres designated<br>
"MS-1" were formed by spray drying an aqueous slurry of<br>
hydrous kaolin which was then calcined at a temperature of<br>
above 1800Â°F. The microspheres had an average particle<br>
size of 70 microns. The following components were mixed:<br>
MS-1	700g<br>
N-brandÂ® silicate	1380g<br>
Water	9063g<br>
Seed Solution of Example	1 497g<br>
21 Wt. % H3PO4	420g<br>
The mixture had a solids content of 6.1% and a pH of<br>
11.5.<br>
The reaction proceeded at about 170Â° C under<br>
agitation in an autoclave for 15 hours. After reaction,<br>
the microspheres were filtered from the mother liquor and<br>
then washed with water. The microspheres were found to<br>
contain 20% crystallized ZSM-5. Table 5 sets forth the<br>
properties of the "as crystallized" material.<br><br>
TABLE 5<br>
Properties of as crystallized in-situ ZSM-5 microspheres<br><br>
Figure 1 is an XRD pattern taken of the as<br>
crystallized microsphere. As can be seen, the peaks<br>
correspond with the ZSM-5 lines shown at the bottom of the<br>
chart.<br>
EXAMPLE 3<br>
The following components were reacted under agitation<br>
in an autoclave as in Example 2.<br>
MS-11	25.0g<br>
Seed Solution of Example	1 17.74g<br>
N-brandÂ®	67.12g<br>
Water	32 3.68g<br>
21 Wt.. % H3PO4	15g<br>
1. The amount of reactive alumina in MS-1 is 0.4 8 wt%.<br>
The pH of the resulting slurry was 11.5. Subsequent<br>
to reaction and filtering of the crystallized microspheres<br>
from the mother liquor, it was found that the microspheres<br>
contained approximately 25 percent ZSM-5.<br><br>
EXAMPLE 4<br>
The microspheres of this example were made in a pilot<br>
plant with nozzle-type atomizer. The following components<br>
as set forth in Table 6 were mixed in a Cowles mixer and<br>
spray dried. The sodium silicate was added directly to<br>
calcined kaolin slurry, resulting in flocculation. Solids<br>
were adjusted appropriately in order to enable spray<br>
drying.<br>

The microspheres were acid washed with nitric acid at<br>
a slurry pH of about 3 to lower the sodium level of the<br>
microspheres to less than 1 wt%. The microspheres were<br>
then dried and calcined at 750Â°F for 2 hours before<br>
further use.<br>

Subsequent to reaction at 180Â°C for 20 hours and<br>
filtration of the crystallized microspheres from the<br>
mother liquor, it was found that the microspheres<br>
contained approximately 40 percent ZSM-5.<br>
EXAMPLE 6<br>
The microspheres of this example were made in a pilot<br>
plant with nozzle-type atomizer. The following components<br>
as set forth in Table 7 were mixed in a Cowles mixer and<br>
spray dried. The sodium silicate was added directly to<br>
the mixed slurry of calcined kaolin and Ludox AS-40<br>
colloidal silica, resulting in flocculation. Solids were<br>
adjusted appropriately in order to enable spray drying.<br>

than 1 wt%. The acid washed microspheres were then dried<br>
and calcined at 750Â°F for 2 hours before further use.<br>

Subsequent to reaction at 180Â°C for 24 hours and<br>
filtering of the crystallized microspheres from the mother<br>
liquor, it was found that the microspheres contained<br>
approximately 50 percent ZSM-5.<br>
EXAMPLE 8<br>
The crystallized microspheres from Example 3 were<br>
ammonium exchanged to reduce the sodium level to less than<br>
0.5 wt% and calcined at 1200Â°F for 2 hours. The resulting<br>
microspheres were added in the amount specified in Table 8<br>
to a steam-deactivated FCC Y zeolite catalyst and compared<br>
with a standard FCC Y zeolite and FCC Y zeolite containing<br>
15% incorporated ZSM-5 additive (fresh) in an experimental<br>
fixed fluid bed unit. The results are shown in Table 8.<br>
The baseline catalyst comprised 90 wt. % FCC Y and 10%<br>
inert particles. The inventive samples contained 90 wt. %<br>
FCC zeolite Y, the stated amount of in-situ ZSM-5, and the<br>
balance inert particles.<br><br><br>
As can be seen from Table 8, the additive catalyst of<br>
the present invention was substantially more active than<br>
the baseline catalyst and even more active than the<br><br>
incorporated ZSM-5 catalyst even though the inventive<br>
catalyst was provided in amounts of about H of that of the<br>
incorporated additive. The addition of ZSM-5 additive to<br>
the baseline is expected to increase activity for gasoline<br>
cracking as is characterized by the reduced gasoline yield<br>
of both compositions containing the additive ZSM-5<br>
catalysts. What is surprising is that the in-situ<br>
additive at a 2.5% level (.625% ZSM-5) is more active than<br>
the-incorporated ZSM-5 additive at a 10% level (1.5% ZSM-<br>
5) (gasoline 44.8 versus 47.54). Importantly, the<br>
propylene yield of the in-situ additive was increased<br>
relative to the ZSM-5 incorporated additive, again even<br>
though the in-situ additive was present in smaller amounts<br>
(propylene 7.9 versus 6.8).<br><br>
