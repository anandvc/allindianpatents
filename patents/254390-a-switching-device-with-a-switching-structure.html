FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to a switching device with a switching structure that<br>
includes a cage assembly having two opposite first sidewalls and one bottom wall<br>
integrally connecting the first sidewalls. The cage assembly is at least partly<br>
configured as a cage in which a slide is displaceably arranged. A moving contact<br>
bridge associated with stationary contact members is held in an opening of the<br>
slide under the pressure of a contact pressure spring. A clearance is provided<br>
between the two first sidewalls for the displacement of the contact bridge. A limit<br>
stop is provided to retain the slide.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
German Publication DE 693 02 599 T2 discloses a multipole isolating switch in<br>
which an isolating structure with disconnectable contacts is provided for each<br>
pole current path. Each pole current path includes two stationary contact<br>
members and two movable contacts arranged on a moving contact bridge, which<br>
forms a pole switch with dual interruption. The moving contact bridge is acted<br>
upon by a mechanism to open and close the contacts. This is effected by a<br>
depressor, which is guided in a stationary cage. The cage is made of an<br>
insulating material and includes a bottom wall and sidewalls perpendicularly<br>
extending therefrom and is provided with windows dimensioned to allow the<br>
displacement of the contact bridge, particularly under the action of the opening<br>
and closing mechanism in case of an electrodynamic recoil. The windows further<br>
define an upper limit stop for the contact bridge. A contact pressure sprirg is<br>
disposed between the bottom wall of the cage and the contact bridge in a central<br>
recess of the cage, which acts as a seat and linear guide of the depressor. The<br><br>
depressor is thus guided along the inner surfaces of the sidewalls of the cage.<br>
The walls of the depressor have openings dimensioned to allow, on the one<br>
hand, the insertion of the contact bridge into the depressor and on the other<br>
hand, an angular movement of the bridge relative to the depressor. The cage<br>
has insulating wings which extend in longitudinal direction over a distance<br>
slightly greater than the length of the contact bridge and the height of which is<br>
sufficient to create a volume that contains the opening arcs.<br>
This arcing chamber assembly is mounted by first inserting the depressor or slide<br>
into the cage and holding it in a defined position. This makes a window in the<br>
slide accessible from the side under the webs forming the limit stops. After the<br>
contact pressure spring has been inserted into the cage from the top through a<br>
hole in the slide, the movable switching element is inserted by means of a die<br>
into the space of the window that is still remaining after the spring has been<br>
pushed through and is then rotated by 90Â° into its final operating position.<br>
A switching device of the aforementioned type is described in EP 59901859. This<br>
document discloses a switching structure 1, a contact pressure spring 2, a<br>
moving contact bridge 3 and a slide 4 in an exploded view according to FIG. 1.<br>
In the view shown, the switching structure 1 essentially consists of two parallel,<br>
elongated sidewalls 5 connected at the bottom by a bottom wall 6 (not<br>
depicted). The space 7 between the two sidewalls 5, i.e., the interior space;, is<br>
accessible from all sides except from the connecting bottom wall 6. In the center<br>
and perpendicularly to the long sides 8, a guide channel 10 is formed by<br>
contours 9 in the sidewalls 5 and is provided with slots 11 in the sidewalls 5.<br>
After the contact pressure spring 2 has been inserted into this guide channel 10<br><br>
and is supported against the bottom wall 6, the moving contact bridge 3 is<br>
likewise inserted into the interior from the top. The dimensions of the guide<br>
channel 10 are adapted to the slide 4. After insertion of the moving contact<br>
bridge 3, the slide 4 is inserted into the guide channel 10 such that its lateal<br>
detents 12 latch with the aforementioned slots 11 and abut the contact bridge 3.<br>
For this purpose, the slide 4 has an opening 15 configured as a recess along the<br>
underside to accommodate the contact bridge 3. The upper limit of the slots 11<br>
serves as a limit stop 18 for the slide 4. The sidewalls 5 have external grooves 13<br>
into which arc splitter plates 16 of an arc splitter stack 17 are inserted. Once the<br>
aforementioned components have been mounted, an assembly 1 as shown in<br>
FIG. 2 is obtained. The described switching structure 1 has lateral insulating<br>
wings, which separate an interior space of the arcing chamber in which the<br>
opening arcs are created during operation of the switching device from an<br>
exterior space of the arcing chamber in which parts of the arc splitter<br>
arrangement are accommodated.<br>
The complete assembly 1 consisting of the switching structure and the attached<br>
arcing chamber is inserted into a bottom part 19 of the switching devices as<br>
shown in FIG. 3. A top part 20 illustrated in FIG. 4, in which stationary contact<br>
members, trigger mechanisms, switching mechanisms and other components are<br>
inserted, is latched to the assembled bottom part 19.<br>
Joining the two preassembled parts, the bottom part 19 and the top part 20,<br>
causes the contact slides 4 in the bottom part 19 and the switching mechanisms<br>
in the top part 20 to engage. A resulting problem is that when high currents are<br>
switched, e.g., in case of short circuits, an arc plasma forms which can reach the<br><br>
top part 20 through gaps and can cause damage there, e.g., as a result of phase<br>
flashovers from one conducting path to another, smoke and thus short circu ts<br>
on a printed circuit board, etc. To prevent this, the goal is always to keep the<br>
gaps between the bottom part 19 and the top part 20 as small as possible. This<br>
results in a contradiction in the area of the contact slide 4. When the bottom part<br>
19 and the top part 20 are joined, the contact slides 4 are guided into openirgs<br>
in the top part 20. Too small a gap can cause the contact slide 4 to jam if the top<br>
part 20 and the bottom part 19 are misaligned.<br>
To solve this problem, essentially two approaches are known:<br>
1.	The openings in the top part are made correspondingly large, such that the<br>
maximum occurring misalignment between the top part and the bottom part<br>
cannot cause the contact slide to jam. This necessarily creates a large gap<br>
between the top part and the bottom part.<br>
2.	The opening in the top part is configured such that a small gap remains<br>
between the contact slide and the opening in the top part after the top part and<br>
the bottom part have been joined. The entire assembly consisting of the<br>
switching structure and the attached arcing chamber is not fixed in the bottom<br>
part. Meshing elements are formed on the top part. When the top part and<br>
bottom part are jointed, the meshing elements on the top part ensure fixation.<br>
The drawback is that the meshing elements, due to design factors, are not solid<br>
enough to withstand the loads from the arcing chamber, e.g., the mechanical<br>
loads caused by short circuiting, stresses due to vibrations or shock during<br>
transport or use, etc. As a result, the meshing elements are deformed, which in<br>
turn causes the contact slides to jam.<br><br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
One object of the invention is to provide a switching device of the<br>
aforementioned type with a switching structure in which jamming of the contact<br>
slide due to component tolerances and/or thermal and mechanical loading is<br>
avoided as much as possible.<br>
A further object of the invention is to provide a method to manufacture such a<br>
switching device.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
These and other objects may be attained as follows.<br>
The switching structure has arcing chambers formed by insulating second<br>
sidewalls. These second sidewalls delimit a volume that contains the opening<br>
arcs. They are arranged on opposite sides of the cage assembly including the<br>
cage, and are respectively separated therefrom by a gap.<br>
In one exemplary embodiment of the invention, a first web of an insulating<br>
material engages with the gap in a positive fit to prevent any harmful thermal<br>
stresses as a result of the opening arcs.<br>
It is furthermore advantageous if the first web is part of a bottom part of the<br>
switching device in which the cage assembly with the cage is arranged.<br><br>
If the two first sidewalls on the side facing away from the bottom wall are<br>
connected by at least one second web, then at least one of the clearance spaces<br>
for the contact bridge is delimited. This provides, for example, a limit stop for the<br>
contact bridge. It also stabilizes the cage assembly with the cage.<br>
A further advantage is obtained if the two sidewalls are integrally interconnected<br>
in a U-shape.<br>
To prevent the two second sidewalls from collapsing, they are fixed by spacer<br>
means on the side facing away from their connection. The spacer means are not<br>
part of the second sidewalls.<br>
To simplify production, the first and second sidewalls are made part of an<br>
originally integral molded part made of an insulating material.<br>
To influence the opening arcs, arc splitter plates surround the first sidewalls.<br>
Advantageously, at least one blow plate is provided for each switching point to<br>
influence the opening arc.<br>
In a further exemplary embodiment, the first sidewalls are provided with the limit<br>
stop for the slide. The slide can be easily latched to the first sidewalls.<br>
According to yet another exemplary embodiment, the slide has latching elements<br>
that engage with slots formed longitudinally to the slide's direction of movement.<br>
This provides a loose latching connection between the slide and the first<br>
sidewalls enabling the displacement of the slide during the switching process.<br><br>
A method of the invention includes producing a molded part, which comprises a<br>
cage formed by two opposing first sidewalls and a bottom wall integrally<br>
connecting the same and second sidewalls integrally connected to the cage. The<br>
molded part is severed at the point where the second sidewalls are connected to<br>
the cage, whereby the cage assembly and the severed second sidewalls are<br>
obtained. The cage assembly and the severed second sidewalls are then inserted<br>
into the bottom part, with or without arc splitter plates, such that a defined gap<br>
is left, respectively, between the cage assembly and the second sidewalls.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS<br>
A switching device according to the invention has a switching structure 1 that<br>
includes a cage assembly 21 and two arc splitter assemblies 22, which are<br>
spaced apart from the cage assembly 21 by a gap 27 as illustrated in figure 6.<br>
The cage assembly 21 has a cage 24 formed by two opposite first sidewalls 5<br>
and a bottom wall 6 integrally connecting the same as shown in figures 5 and 6<br>
and a slide 4 displaceably arranged therein. A moving contact bridge 3<br>
associated with stationary contact members is held in an opening 15 of the slide<br>
4 under the pressure of a contact pressure spring 2. The cage 24 has a passage<br>
14 leading from its interior 7 toward the outside, which enables the insertion of<br>
the contact bridge 3 into the interior of the cage 24 substantially perpendicular<br>
to the longitudinal extent of the contact bridge for mounting between the contact<br>
pressure spring 2 and the slide 4. A clearance 26 is provided between the two<br>
first sidewalls 5 for the displacement of the contact bridge 3. A limit stop 18 is<br><br>
provided to retain the slide 4. The switching structure 1, as shown in figure 7,<br>
further includes arcing chambers formed by insulating second sidewalls 23, in<br>
which an opening arc is created when a high current is interrupted. The arc<br>
splitter plates 16 have a region with elongated feet, which enclose the second<br>
sidewalls 23 and cause the arc to drift away from the contact points. The second<br>
sidewalls 23 together with the arc splitter plates 16 form the arc splitter<br>
assembly 22. On the opposite side of the cage assembly 21 and spaced apart<br>
therefrom by a gap 27, an arc splitter assembly 22 is arranged, which parly<br>
encloses the contact bridge 3, as illustrated in FIG. 6. According to one<br>
production method of the invention, the first sidewalls 5 and the second<br>
sidewalls 23 can be parts of an originally integral molded part made of an<br>
insulating material, as illustrated in figure 5.<br>
The first sidewalls 5 have the limit stop 18 for the slide 4. The slide 4 can be<br>
latched to the first sidewalls 5 and is provided with latching elements 12, which<br>
engage in slots 11 formed longitudinally to the direction of movement of the<br>
slide 4.<br>
The two first sidewalls 5 are connected at two opposite long sides by a bottom<br>
wall 6, against which the contact pressure spring 2 is supported.<br>
Figure 7 shows a bottom part 19, typically made of an insulating material, which<br>
has a first web 28 that engages in a form-locking manner with the gap 27<br>
between the cage assembly 21 and the second sidewalls 23.<br><br>
According to a second embodiment, the two first sidewalls 5 are interconnected<br>
by at least one second web 29 on the side facing away from the bottom wall 6.<br>
This delimits at least one of the clearance spaces 26 for displacing the contact<br>
bridge 3 as shown in FIG. 8. In this case, the second web 29 can stiffen the cage<br>
assembly 21 and/or act as a limit stop for the contact bridge 3.<br>
According to a further embodiment, the two second sidewalls 23 can be<br>
integrally interconnected in a U-shape, as illustrated in figure 9.<br>
In the embodiment according to figure 9, the two second sidewalls 23, along the<br>
side facing away from their connection, are fixed by a spacer 30, which belong to<br>
the top part 20 or to components received in the top part 20. Here, the spacer<br>
30 is configured as projections on the stationary contact members disposed in<br>
the top part 20. Of course, other ways of fixing the sidewalls 23 by spacing as<br>
known in the art are envisioned.<br>
To influence the opening arc, at least one blow plate 31 is provided as shown in<br>
10, which in the present example is pressed against the outside of the second<br>
sidewalls 23. The blow plate 31 represents an alternative solution to the feet of<br>
the arc splitter plates 16 shown in Figure 6. It likewise causes the arc to drift<br>
away from the contact point. Figure 10 shows a switching structure of a<br>
switching device according to the invention prior to installation in a bottom part,<br>
i.e., the sidewalls 23 with the arc splitter plates 16 and the cage assembly 21 are<br>
separate components.<br><br>
The invention further relates to a method for producing a switching device<br>
according to the invention with the above-described switching structure 1. This<br>
method will now be described in greater detail.<br>
First, the molded part is produced, which includes the cage 24 formed by the two<br>
opposite first sidewalls 5 and the bottom wall 6 integrally connecting the same<br>
and the second sidewalls 23 integrally connected to the cage 24. The first<br>
sidewalls 5, the second sidewalls 23 and the bottom wall 6 form an interior space<br>
which in a plane largely parallel to the bottom wall 6 has a passage 14 to the<br>
outside having a length corresponding to at least the length of the contact bridge<br>
3.<br>
Subsequently the contact pressure spring 2, the contact bridge 3 and the slide 4<br>
are inserted into the cage 24 through the passage 14, and the arc splitter plates<br>
16 are fixed to the second sidewalls 23 to obtain the switching structure 1 shown<br>
in FIG. 6. The arc splitter plates 16 can be fastened by inserting them in grooves<br>
13 of the second sidewalls 23 as illustrated in FIGS. 5 and 6 to obtain a finally<br>
assembled switching structure 1.<br>
Thereafter, the molded part of the switching structure 1 is separated at the point<br>
where the second sidewalls 23 are connected to the cage 24, e.g., in a milling or<br>
cutting process, such that the cage assembly 21 and the two arc splitter<br>
assemblies 22 shown in figure 6 are obtained.<br>
Subsequently, the cage assembly 21 and the separated second sidewalls 23 are<br>
inserted into the bottom part 19, with or without the arc splitter plates 16, as<br>
illustrated in figure 7, such that a defined gap 27 each remains between the cage<br>
assembly 21 and the second sidewalls 23.<br><br>
Instead of the cage 24 being open toward the top and being provided with the<br>
passage, it may alternatively have second webs 29 as described in DE 69302599<br>
T2.<br>
The sidewalls 23, referred to as insulating wings in that document, are severed<br>
once the cage 24 has been equipped with the contact pressure spring 2, the<br>
contact bridge 3 and the slide 4. The resulting cage assembly 21 and the severed<br>
sidewalls 23 are in turn inserted into the bottom part 19 of the switching device,<br>
either with or without arc splitter plates, such that they are spaced apart from<br>
one another by a defined gap 27. The edge contours of the gaps 27 are<br>
preferably predetermined by the production process.<br>
The above description of the exemplary embodiments has been given by way of<br>
example. From the disclosure given, those skilled in the art will not only<br>
understand the present invention and its attendant advantages, but will also find<br>
apparent various changes and modifications to the structures and methods<br>
disclosed. It is sought, therefore, to cover all such changes and modifications as<br>
fall within the spirit and scope of the invention, as defined by the appended<br>
claims, and equivalents thereof.<br><br>
