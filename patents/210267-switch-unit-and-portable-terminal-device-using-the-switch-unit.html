SWITCH UNIT AND PORTABLE TERMINAL DEVICE USING THE SWITCH UNIT<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Technical Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a switch unit operated by pushing a keypad, and to a portable terminal device having such a switch unit.<br>
2.	Description of the Related Art<br>
Conventionally, there is known a portable terminal device such as  a portable telephone or the like, which has a switch unit provided with selector cursor key switches for selecting data displayed on a display portion, and a fixer key switch for fixing the selected data, those switches being operated by pushing keypads.  JP-A-9-261311 discloses an example of a portable telephone which uses such selector cursor key switches and a fixer key switch instead of conventional ten-keys (number keys) .  There is also conventionally known a portable terminal device, such as a portable telephone, having selector cursor key switches and a fixer key in addition to ten-key switches. In such a portable telephone, a housing is generally constituted by a casing 1 and a cover 2 as shown in Fig. 7.  In addition, the cover 2 is provided with ten-keypads 3 through which a numerical value such as  a phone number or the like is inputted, a selector cursor keypad 4 having a scrolling function, a fixer<br><br>
*<br>
keypad 5 having a fixer switch function, transmitter and receiver portions 6 and 7, a display portion 8 for displaying input characters or figures, and an antenna 9.  To register a phone number in this portable telephone, the selector cursor keypad 4 is first used to confirm a phonebook registration area displayed on a menu section of the display portion 8, and then the fixer keypad 5 is pushed.  Thus, registration with a phonebook is permitted.  The ten-keypads 3 are pushed in this state to thereby input a name and a phone number to be registered, and then the fixer keypad 5 is pushed to perform registration.<br>
Alternatively, JP-A-8-96665 discloses another multi-input switch for generating a signal corresponding to the tiltina direction of an operating shaft tilted bv a tilting operation, and a signal corresponding to a push operation. In such a multi-input switch, generally, as shown in Fig. 8, a switch board 13 is disposed on the bottom surface of a switch casing 12 retained in a switch chassis 11, and a first switch 14 is disposed at the center of the top surface of the switch board 13 while a second switch 15 is disposed around the first<br><br><br>
to the top of the projecting straight rod portion.<br>
In addition, JP-A-i39880 discloses a multi-input switch in which the tilr of the operating lever brings a movable contact member or a metal operating lever into an electrical connection with a predetermined place of an annular resistor, and makes electrical conduction between the resistor and a fixed electrode, so that an electric signal corresponding to the tilting direction of the operating lever can be extracted.  Thus, the multi-input switch can be made small and thin.<br>
In the background-art portable terminal device such as a portable telephone or the like having selector cursor key switches and a fixer key switch and described with reference to Fig. 7, the selector cursor keypad 4 and the fixer keypad 5 are disposed separately, so that the area occupied by the key input portion becomes large as a whole, and it will be an obstacle to prospective miniaturization of the portable terminal device. Thus, it is considered that the multi-input switch disclosed in JP-A-8-96665 described with reference to Fig. 8 is applied<br><br><br>
Â«<br>
of the switch board 13 while the second switch 15 is disposed around the first switch 14.  In addition, the operating shaft 16 constuted by the straight rod portion and the flange portion is disposed so that the protrusion portion on the lower surface of the flange portion faces the first and second switches 14 and 15 on the switch board 13, and the straight rod portion projects tiltably on the top surface of the switch casing 12.  The switch pad 17 is attached to the top of the projecting straight rod portion.  Accordingly, the switch unit is large as a whole, and the structure thereof is complicated, so that the cost increases.  As disclosed in JP-A-6-139880, there is another multi-input switch which is designed to extract an electric signal in accordance with the tilting direction of an  operating lever without using a push switch, so that the multi-input switch can be made small and thin.  However, also in this case, the multi-input switch has a basic structure similar to that shown in Fig. 8.  That is, the switch unit is large as a whole, and the structure is complicated, so that the cost increases.<br><br><br>
to each other.  It is another object of the present invention to provide a portable terminal device in which the above-mentioned switch unit is used so that the portable terminal device can  be reduced in space for a key input portion, and in size and cost as s whole, and is superior in operation performance.<br>

In addition, the selector cursor key switch may have switch circuits numbering in n which is an optional number, and it is a matter of course that various alternations can be made within a scope not-departing from the technical thought of the present invention.<br>
In addition, although the switch unit according to the present invention is applied to a portable telephone, the oresent invention is also applicable to portable terminal device other than the portable telephone.<br>
As described above, according to the present invention, in the switch unit configured to be operated by pushing of keypads, two kinds of switches can be allocated to two layers of printed boards so as  to be disposed adjacently to each other in planar view. Accordingly, keypads for the switches can be disposed at a place, and also can be made into one keypad miniaturized by integral forming, so that the switch unit can be miniaturized.  In addition, the switches are disposed at high and low levels separately. The degree of freedom on mechanism is therefore increased so that the structure can be simplified, and the cost can be restrained.  In addition, when this switch<br><br>
unit is used in portable terminal device, for example, selector<br>
â <br>
cursor key switches and a fixer key switch can be disposed adjacently to each other in planar view so that their keypads can be integrated. As a result, the space for a key input portion can be reduced, so that it is possible to obtain portable terminal device which is small in size, low in cost and superior in operation performance.<br><br><br><br>
