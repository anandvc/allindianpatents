				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
NOVEL CONDENSED IMIDAZOLE DERIVATIVES<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to novel condensed imidazole derivatives useful as dipeptidyl peptidase-IV (DPPIV) inhibitors and uses thereof.<br>
Background Art<br>
Dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPPIV) is a serine protease which specifically hydrolyzes dipeptide -X-Pro (X = arbitrary amino acid) from the free N terminus of a polypeptide chain.<br>
Glucose-dependent, insulin secretion-stimulating hormones, known as incretins (GLP-1: Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 and GIP: Glucose-dependent Insulinotropic Polypeptide) secreted in the digestive tract following meals are rapidly hydrolyzed and inactivated by DPPIV. When the hydrolysis by DPPIV is suppressed, the action of incretin (GLP-1 and GIP) is enhanced, which in turn increases the glucose-stimulated secretion of insulin from the P cells of the pancreas.  This has been shown to improve hyperglycemia in the oral glucose tolerance test (see Diabetologia 1999 Nov, 42(11), 1324-31).  In addition, GLP-1 is known to be involved in the suppression of appetite and food intake.  GLP-1 has also been reported to have the effect of protecting the P cells of the pancreas by enhancing P cell differentiation and proliferation. Thus, a DPPIV inhibitor can be a useful therapeutic or preventive agent for diseases with which GLP-1 and/or GIP are associated, such as obesity and diabetes mellitus.<br>
Furthermore, there are many reports suggesting a relationship between dipeptidyl peptidase IV and various diseases as described below. Thus , a DPPIV inhibitor can be a therapeutic agent for diseases such as:<br>
(1)	preventive and therapeutic agents for AIDS (see Science 1993 ,<br>
262, 2045-2050),<br>
(2)	preventive and therapeutic agents for osteoporosis (see<br><br>
Clinical chemistry 1988, 34, 2499-2501),<br>
(3)	preventive and therapeutic agents for intestinal disorders<br>
(see Endocrinology 2000, 141, 4013-4020),<br>
(4)	preventive and therapeutic agents for diabetes mellitus, obesity, and hyperlipidemia (see Diabetes 1998, 47, 1663-1670; and Life Sci 2000, 66(2), 91-103),<br>
(5)	preventive and therapeutic agents for angiogenesis (see Agents and Actions 1991, 32, 125-127),<br>
(6)	preventive and therapeutic agents for infertility (see International Publication WO 00/56296) ,<br><br>
(7)	preventive and therapeutic agents for inflammatory diseases , autoimmune diseases, and chronic rheumatoid arthritis (see The Journal of Immunology 2001, 166, 2041-2048), and<br>
(8)	preventive and therapeutic agents for cancer (see Br J Cancer 1999 Mar, 79 (7-8) , 1042-8; and J Androl 2000 Mar-Apr, 21 (2) , 220-6) .<br>
Some DPPIV inhibitors are disclosed in the Publication of US patent No. 2002/0161001; International Publication WO 03/004496; and Publication of US patent No. 2002/0198205. However, there is no known DPPIV inhibitor having a hypoxanthine or imidazopyridazinone structure backbone.<br>
A compound having DPPIV-inhibiting activity that can be used as a pharmaceutical agent is being anxiously sought as described above. However, a compound with excellent DPPIV-inhibiting activity, which is also highly useful as a clinically effective pharmaceutical is yet to be discovered. Specifically, an objective of the present invention is to provide compounds having DPPIV-inhibiting activity, which can be used as preventive, therapeutic, or alleviating agents for diabetes mellitus or such diseases.<br>

Each test compound was suspended in a 0.5% methyl cellulose (MC) solution at the concentration indicated below in Table.  The suspension of a test compound, and of NVP DPP728 (US patent No. 6011155), or a 0.5% MC solution that was used as a medium control group was given orally at a dose of 10 mL/kg. After 30 minutes, a glucose solution was given orally at a dose of 10 mL/kg. The dose of glucose given orally was 2 g/kg. [Blood collection and determination of blood glucose levels]<br>
Immediately before administering the test compound and NVP DPP728, immediately before administering the glucose solution, and 30, 60, and 120 minutes after the administration, without anesthetic the caudal vein was lightly cut with a razor blade to let bl"ood out.<br>
10 |il of blood was collected and immediately combined with 140 \xl of 0.6 M perchloric acid. The sample was centrifuged at 1500 g at 4°C for 10 minutes in a refrigerated centrifuge GS-6KR (Beckman Corp.). The glucose concentration in the resulting supernatant was determined using Glucose CII TEST WAKO (Wako Pure Chemical Industries). Result:<br>
The area under the blood glucose level time curve (AUCo-120; Area Under the Curve) obtained from the curve of time vs . blood glucose level between the start of glucose administration and 120 minutes after administration was determined for each of the 0.5% MC solution-treated group, NVP DPP72 8-treated group and test compound-treated group.  The improvement factor for glucose tolerance of a test compound was determined by taking the AUC0-12Q of the 0.5% MC solution-treated group as 100% and the AUCo-120 of the NVP .DPP728 (10 mg/kg)-treated group as 0% according to the formula indicated below.<br>
Improvement factor for glucose tolerance (%) = (AUCo-120 of the group treaxied with a test compound - AUCo-120 of the group treated with NVP DPP728 (10 mg/kg))/ AUCo-120 of the group treated with 0.5% MC solution - AUCo-120 of the group treated with NVP DPP728 (10 mg/kg))<br><br>

[Assay Example 3] Acceptable timing of administration in in  vivo  test<br>
A drug for treating postprandial hyperglycemia is ideally required to have comparable, effectiveness in treating postprandial hyperglycemia when it is given immediately before meals as well as 1 hour before meals.  Thus, an excellent drug exhibiting higher efficacy can be achieved by widening the range of acceptable timing of administration Method:<br>
The respective tests described below were carried out in combinarion with the in  vivo  test (administration before 0.5 hour) as described in Assay Example 2:<br>
1.	A test compound is administered simultaneously with glucose loading (2 g/kg) (the test compound is suspended in an aqueous solution of 0 . 5% methyl cellulose ; the solution is combined with an equal volume of a glucose solution; and the mixture is administered orally at a dose of 10 ml/kg);<br>
2.	A test compound is administered one hour before glucose loading (2 g/kg) (the test compound suspended in an aqueous solution of 0.5% methyl cellulose is administered orally one hour before the oral administration of the glucose solution; each is given orally<br>
.at a dose of 10 ml/kg).<br>
The improvement factor for glucose tolerance is estimated in each test. The range of acceptable timing of administration can be assessed by estimating whether comparable degrees of improvement are obtained by the two types of administrations, preferably when the dose difference is 3 times or lower, and most preferably estimating<br><br>
whether comparable degrees of improvement are obtained by the two types of administrations when the doses are identical.  Such representative compounds of the present invention (in particular, compounds selected from the group consisting of those shown in Examples 82, 119, 120, 122, 229, and 267) were shown to have sufficiently wide ranges of acceptable timing of administration as defined above.<br>

The compounds of the present invention were evaluated for their ability to inhibit metabolic reactions due to P450 in Assay Example 6. This experiment showed that representative compounds of the present invention (in particular, compounds selected from the group consisting of those shown in Examples 82, 119, 120, 122, 229, and 267) exhibited 10 uM or higher IC50 values with respect to five out of the P450 group of molecules, namely the molecular species, CYP1A2 , CYP2C9, CyP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4.<br>
[Assay Example 7]<br><br><suppression of herg channel current><br>
(1)	Activity towards inhibiting the hERG channel current was evaluated according to the report Zhou, Z et al, Biophysical Journal, 74 (1) , 230-241 (1998) .	<br>
(2)	This experiment was carried out using HEK-293 cells into which the hERG channel gene (subtype 1) had been introduced (the cell line was established by the inventors).<br>
(3)	One to several days before the experiment, cells were plated on a poly-lysine-coated glass plate. The cells were cultured until the day of the experiment. At the start of the experiment, the cell-seeded glass plate was transferred into a bath for current measurement. The hERG channel current was measured by the voltage clamp method using the patch clamp technique. The current was measured using a current amplifier (Axon Instruments).  The current was recorded and analyzed using pCLAMP software (Axon Instruments).<br>
(4)	The hERG channel current was induced by applying to the cells a depolarizing pulse from a holding potential of -80 mV to +20 mV for 5 seconds and to -50 mV for 4 seconds, at 20 second intervals. After rhe current became stable in a control solution, the-cells were perfused with solutions containing various concentrations of test compounds.<br>
(5)	The amplitude of the hERG channel current was defined as<br>
the peak value of the tail current observed upon restoring the<br>
potential to -50 mV. The inhibiting effect of a test compound on the<br>
hERG channel current (IC50) was estimated based on the change in th-e<br>
peak value of tail current upon addition of the test compound at<br>
various concentrations. The peak value of tail current recorded for<br>
a nor.mal solution was taken as 100%.<br><test result><br>
Representative compounds of the present invention (in particular , compounds selected from the group consisting of those shown in Examples 82, 119,120, 122, 229, and 267) were evaluated for their ability to inhibit the hERG channel current in Assay Example 7 .  The<br>
