PILOT TRANSMISSION AND CHANNEL ESTIMATION WITH PILOT WEIGHTING<br>
Claim of Priority under 35 U.S.C. §119<br>
[0001] The present Application for Patent claims priority to Provisional Application No. 60/681,586 entitled "CHANNEL ESTIMATION ENHANCEMENT USING PILOT WEIGHTING" filed May 16, 2005, and Provisional Application No. 60/710,618 entitled "PILOT TRANSMISSION AND CHANNEL ESTIMATION WITH PILOT WEIGHTING" filed August 22, 2005, both assigned to the assignee hereof and hereby expressly incorporated by reference herein.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
I.	Field<br>
[0002] The present disclosure relates generally to communication, and more specifically to techniques for transmitting a pilot and for performing channel estimation in a communication system.<br>
II.	Background<br>
[0003] In a wireless communication system, a transmitter typically encodes, interleaves, and modulates (or symbol maps) traffic data to obtain data symbols, which are modulation symbols for data. For a coherent system, the transmitter multiplexes pilot symbols with the data symbols, processes the multiplexed data and pilot symbols to generate a modulated signal, and transmits this signal via a wireless channel. The wireless channel distorts the transmitted signal with a channel response and further degrades the signal with noise and interference.<br>
[0004] A receiver receives the transmitted signal and processes the received signal to obtain received data and pilot symbols. For coherent data detection, the receiver estimates the response of the wireless channel based on the received pilot symbols. The receiver then performs data detection (e.g., equalization) on the received data symbols with the channel estimate to obtain data symbol estimates, which are estimates of the data   symbols   transmitted  by  the   transmitter.      The   receiver   then   demodulates,<br><br>
WO 2006/124810<br><br><br><br>
PCT/US2006/018789<br><br>
deinterleaves, and decodes the data symbol estimates to obtain decoded data for the<br>
transmitter.<br>
[0005]       The quality of the channel estimate has a large impact on data detection<br>
performance and affects the quality of the data symbol estimates as well as the<br>
reliability of the decoded data.   There is therefore a need in the art for techniques to<br>
effectively perform channel estimation in a wireless communication system.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
[0006] Techniques to transmit a pilot in a single-carrier communication system and to perform channel estimation with pilot weighting in single-carrier and multi-carrier communication systems are described herein. The pilot transmission techniques may be used for single-carrier frequency division multiple access (SC-FDMA) schemes such as interleaved FDMA (EFDMA), localized FDMA (LFDMA), and enhanced FDMA (EFDMA). The channel estimation techniques may be used for SC-FDMA schemes and multi-carrier FDMA (MC-FDMA) schemes such as orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA). In general, modulation symbols are sent in the time domain with SC-FDMA and in the frequency domain with MC-FDMA.<br>
[0007] In an embodiment, a transmitter forms a sequence of modulation symbols for a pilot. The sequence of modulation symbols is sent in the time domain and has a non-flat frequency response. The transmitter generates at least one transmission symbol for the sequence of modulation symbols based on an SC-FDMA scheme (e.g., IFDMA, LFDMA or EFDMA).<br>
[0008] In an embodiment, a receiver receives at least one transmission symbol for a pilot transmitted by a transmitter. Each transmission symbol may be generated with an SC-FDMA scheme (e.g., EFDMA, LFDMA or EFDMA) or an MC-FDMA scheme (e.g., OFDMA). The receiver removes the cyclic prefix and performs a discrete Fourier transform (DFT) or a fast Fourier transform (FFT) on each received transmission symbol to obtain received pilot values. The receiver may derive an interference estimate based on the received pilot values and may estimate the reliability of the received pilot values based on the interference estimate. The receiver determines weights for the received pilot values based on the transmitted pilot values, the estimated reliability of the received pilot values, and/or other information. The receiver derives a channel estimate based on the received pilot values and the weights. The receiver may iteratively perform channel and interference estimation. If pilot and data are transmitted<br><br>
WO 2006/124810		PCT/US2006/018789<br>
on different subbands, then the receiver may derive a channel estimate for the data subbands based on (1) the channel estimate for the pilot subbands or (2) the received pilot values and the weights. The receiver then performs data detection (e.g., equalization, match filtering, or receiver spatial processing) on received data values with the channel estimate.<br>
[0009] Various aspects and embodiments of the invention are described in further detail below.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0019] The word "exemplary" is used herein to mean "serving as an example, instance, or illustration." Any embodiment or design described herein as "exemplary" is not necessarily to be construed as preferred or advantageous over other embodiments or designs.<br>
[0020] FIG. 1 shows block diagram of a transmitter 110 and a receiver 150 in a wireless communication system 100. For simplicity, transmitter 110 and receiver 150 are each equipped with a single antenna. For the reverse link (or uplink), transmitter 110 may be part of a terminal, and receiver 150 may be part of a base station.  For the<br><br>
WO 2006/124810	 	PCT/US2006/018789<br>
 forward link (or downlink), transmitter 110 may be part of a base station, and receiver 150 may be part of a terminal. A base station is generally a fixed station and may also be called a base transceiver system (BTS), an access point, a Node B, or some other terminology. A terminal may be fixed or mobile and may be a wireless device, a cellular phone, a personal digital assistant (PDA), a wireless modem card, and so on. <br>
[0021] At transmitter 110, a transmit (TX) data and pilot processor 120 encodes, interleaves, symbol maps data (e.g., traffic data and signaling) and generates data symbols. Processor 120 also generates pilot symbols and multiplexes the data symbols and pilot symbols. As used herein, a data symbol is a modulation symbol for data, a pilot symbol is a modulation symbol for pilot, a modulation symbol is a complex value for a point in a signal constellation (e.g., for PSK or QAM), and a symbol is a complex value. A modulator 130 performs single-carrier or multi-carrier modulation on the data and pilot symbols and generates transmission symbols. A transmitter unit (TMTR) 132 processes (e.g., converts to analog, amplifies, filters, and frequency upconverts) the transmission symbols and generates a radio frequency (RF) modulated signal, which is transmitted via an antenna 134.<br>
[0022] At receiver 150, an antenna 152 receives the RF modulated signal from transmitter 110 and provides a received signal to a receiver unit (RCVR) 154. Receiver unit 154 conditions (e.g., filters, amplifies, frequency downconverts, and digitizes) the received signal and provides input samples. A demodulator 160 performs single-carrier or multi-carrier demodulation on the input samples to obtain received data values and received pilot values. A channel estimator/processor 180 derives a channel estimate for transmitter 110 based on the received pilot values. Demodulator 160 further performs data detection (e.g., equalization or matched filtering) on the received data values with the channel estimate and provides data symbol estimates, which are estimates of the data symbols sent by transmitter 110. An RX data processor 170 symbol demaps, deinterleaves, and decodes the data symbol estimates and provides decoded data for transmitter 110. In general, the processing by receiver 150 is complementary to the processing by transmitter 110.<br>
[0023]       Controllers/processors   140   and   190   direct   the   operation   of  various processing units at transmitter 110 and receiver 150, respectively.   Memories 142 and 192 store program codes and data for transmitter 110 and receiver 150, respectively. [0024]       System 100 may be a single-carrier system or a multiple-carrier system.  A single-carrier system may utilize an SC-FDMA scheme such as IFDMA to transmit data<br><br>
WO 2006/124810<br><br><br><br>
PCT/US2006/018789<br><br>
and pilot on frequency subbands that are distributed across  the overall  system bandwidth, LFDMA to transmit data and pilot on a group of adjacent subbands, or EFDMA to transmit data and pilot on multiple groups of adjacent subbands. IFDMA is also called distributed FDMA, and LFDMA is also called narrowband FDMA or classical FDMA.   A multi-carrier system may utilize an MC-FDMA scheme such as OFDMA. OFDMA utilizes orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM). <br>
[0025]       System  100 may utilize one or multiple multiplexing schemes for the forward and reverse links. For example, system 100 may utilize (1) SC-FDMA for both the forward and reverse links, (2) one version of SC-FDMA (e.g., LFDMA) for one link and another version of SC-FDMA (e.g., IFDMA) for the other link, (3) MC-FDMA for both the forward and reverse links, (4) SC-FDMA for one link (e.g., reverse link) and MC-FDMA for the other link (e.g., forward link), or (5) some other combination of multiplexing schemes. In general, system 100 may utilize one or multiple multiplexing schemes (e.g., SC-FDMA, or MC-FDMA, or a combination of SC-FDMA and MC-FDMA) for each link to achieve the desired performance. For example, SC-FDMA and OFDMA may be used for a given link, with SC-FDMA being used for some subbands and OFDMA being used on other subbands.  It may be desirable to use SC-FDMA on the reverse link to achieve lower peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) and to use OFDMA on the forward link to potentially achieve higher system capacity. <br>
[0026]       The pilot transmission and channel estimation techniques may be used for the forward and reverse links. The channel estimation techniques may be used for SC-FDMA (e.g., IFDMA, LFDMA, and EFDMA) as well as MC-FDMA (e.g., OFDMA). <br>
[0027]       FIG. 2A shows an interlace subband structure 200 that may be used for SC-FDMA and MC-FDMA. The overall system bandwidth of BW MHz is partitioned into multiple (K) orthogonal subbands that are given indices of 1 through K, where K may be any integer value.   The spacing between adjacent subbands is BW/K MHz.  For simplicity, the following description assumes that all K total subbands are usable for transmission. For subband structure 200, the K subbands are arranged into S disjoint or non-overlapping interlaces. The S interlaces are disjoint in that each of the K subbands belongs in only one interlace.   For subband structure 200, each interlace contains N subbands that are uniformly distributed across the K total subbands, consecutive subbands in each interlace are spaced apart by S subbands, and interlace u contains subband u as the first subband, where  K = S-N   and  we{l,...,S}.    In general, a subband structure may include any number of interlaces, each interlace may contain any<br><br>
WO 2006/124810	PCT/US2006/018789<br>
number of subbands, and the interlaces may contain the same or different numbers of subbands. Furthermore, N may or may not be an integer divisor of K, and the N subbands may or may not be uniformly distributed across the K total subbands. <br>
[0028] FIG. 2B shows a narrowband subband structure 210 that may also be used for SC-FDMA and MC-FDMA. For subband structure 210, the K total subbands are arranged into S non-overlapping groups, each group contains N adjacent subbands, and group v contains subbands (v -1) • N +1 through v • N, where K = S • N and v 6 {1,..., S}. In general, a subband structure may include any number of groups, each group may contain any number of subbands, and the groups may contain the same or different numbers of subbands.<br>
[0029] FIG. 2C shows another subband structure 220 that may also be used for SC-<br>
FDMA and MC-FDMA. For subband structure 220, the K total subbands are arranged<br>
into S non-overlapping sets, with each set including G groups of subbands. The K total<br>
subbands may be distributed to the S sets as follows. The K total subbands are first<br>
partitioned into multiple frequency ranges, with each frequency range containing<br>
K'=K/G consecutive subbands. Each frequency range is further partitioned into S<br>
groups, with each group including V adjacent subbands. For each frequency range, the<br>
first V subbands are allocated to set 1, the next V subbands are allocated to set 2, and so<br>
on, and the last V subbands are allocated to set S. Set s, for s = l, ...,S, includes<br>
subbands	having	indices	k        that	satisfy	the	following:<br>
(s-\)-V<k modulo each set contains g groups of v consecutive subbands or a total n="G" subbands. in general subband structure may include any number sets contain and the same different numbers for be distributed uniformly non-uniformly across system bandwidth.></k>
[0030] Subband structures 200, 210 and 220 may be used for SC-FDMA and MC-FDMA. For SC-FDMA, subband structures 200, 210 and 220 are used for IFDMA, LFDMA, and EFDMA, respectively. For SC-FDMA, a transmission symbol generated for one or more interlaces in FIG. 2A is called an IFDMA symbol, a transmission symbol generated for one or more subband groups in FIG. 2B is called an LFDMA symbol, and a transmission symbol generated for one or more subband sets in FIG. 2C is called an EFDMA symbol.  For MC-FDMA, subband structures 200, 210 and 220<br><br>
WO 2006/124810		PCT/US2006/018789<br>
may be used for OFDMA, and a transmission symbol generated for one or more interlaces, one or more subband groups, or one or more subband sets for OFDMA is called an OFDM symbol. A transmission symbol may thus be an SC-FDMA symbol generated with an SC-FDMA scheme or an MC-FDMA symbol generated with an MC-FDMA scheme. An SC-FDMA symbol may be an IFDMA symbol, an LFDMA symbol, or an EFDMA symbol. An MC-FDMA symbol may be an OFDM symbol. <br>
[0031] As generically used herein, a subband set is a set of subbands, which may be an interlace for subband structure 200, a subband group for subband structure 210, a set of multiple subband groups for subband structure 220, and so on. For each symbol period, multiple (N) modulation symbols may be sent on a subband set in either the time domain with SC-FDMA or the frequency domain with MC-FDMA. In general, the techniques described herein may be used for any subband structure with any number of subband sets and where each subband set may include any number of subbands that may be arranged in any manner. For each subband set, (1) the subbands may be individually and either uniformly or non-uniformly distributed across the system bandwidth, (2) the subbands may be adjacent to one another in one group, or (3) the subbands may be distributed in multiple groups, where each group may be located anywhere in the system bandwidth and may contain one or multiple subbands.<br>
[0032] FIG. 3A shows the generation of an SC-FDMA symbol. An original sequence of N modulation symbols to be transmitted in the time domain on N subbands in one symbol period is denoted as  {dvd2,d3,...,dn}   (block 310).    The original<br>
sequence is transformed to the frequency domain with an N-point DFT/FFT to obtain a sequence of N frequency-domain values (block 312). The N frequency-domain values are mapped onto the N subbands used for transmission, and zero values are mapped onto the remaining K-N subbands to generate a sequence of K values (block 314). The N subbands used for transmission may belong in one group of subbands for LFDMA (as shown in FIG. 3A), one interlace for IFDMA (not shown in FIG. 3A), or one set of multiple subband groups for EFDMA (also not shown in FIG. 3A). The sequence of K values is transformed to the time domain with a K-point IDFi7IFFT to obtain a sequence of K time-domain output samples (block 316). The last C output samples of the sequence are copied to the start of the sequence to form an SC-FDMA symbol that contains K + C output samples (block 318). The C copied output samples are often called a cyclic prefix or a guard interval, and C is the cyclic prefix length. The<br><br>
WO 2006/124810	  	PCT/US2006/018789<br>
cyclic prefix is used to combat intersymbol interference (ISI) caused by frequency selective fading.<br>
[0033] FIG. 3B shows the generation of an MC-FDMA symbol. An original sequence of N modulation symbols to be transmitted in the frequency domain on N subbands in one symbol period is denoted as {dvd2,d3,...,dN} (block 350). The N modulation symbols are mapped onto the N subbands used for transmission, and zero values are mapped onto the remaining K - N subbands to generate a sequence of K values (block 352). The N subbands used for transmission may belong in one interlace in FIG. 2A, one subband group in FIG. 2B, or one subband set in FIG. 2C. The sequence of K values is transformed to the time domain with a K-point BDFT/IFFT to obtain a sequence of K time-domain output samples (block 354). The last C output samples of the sequence are copied to the start of the sequence to form an MC-FDMA symbol that contains K + C output samples (block 356).<br>
[0034] SC-FDMA symbols and MC-FDMA symbols may also be generated in other manners.<br>
[0035] FIG. 4A shows a transmission scheme 400 that may be used for SC-FDMA and MC-FDMA. For transmission scheme 400, a transmitter transmits data and pilot using time division multiplexing (TDM). The transmitter transmits data on T subbands for some number of symbol periods, then pilot on the T subbands for at least one symbol period, then data on the T subbands for some number of symbol periods, and so on. The T subbands may be for one or more interlaces in FIG. 2A, one or more subband groups in FIG. 2B, one or more subband sets in FIG. 2C, some other subset of the K total subbands, or all K total subbands.<br>
[0036] FIG. 4B shows another transmission scheme 410 that may also be used for SC-FDMA and MC-FDMA. For transmission scheme 410, a transmitter transmits data and pilot using frequency division multiplexing (FDM) on T subbands. The transmitter transmits data on D subbands and transmits pilot on P subbands, where T = D + P. The subbands used for data transmission are called data subbands, and the subbands used for pilot transmission are called pilot subbands. The D data subbands and the P pilot subbands may be for one or more interlaces in FIG. 2A, one or more subband groups in FIG. 2B, one or more subband sets in FIG. 2C, some other subset of the K total subbands, or all K total subbands.<br><br>
WO 2006/124810	 	PCT/US2006/018789<br>
[0037] The data and pilot subbands may change over time (e.g., as shown in FIG. 4B) to allow a receiver to estimate the frequency response across all or most of the system bandwidth over time. Alternatively, the data and pilot subbands may be static (not shown in FIG. 4B).<br>
[0038] In general, the transmitter may transmit on any number of subbands and may transmit data and pilot on the same or different subbands. Furthermore, the transmitter may transmit a common pilot to multiple receivers and/or a dedicated pilot to a specific receiver. The term "pilot" thus generically covers both common pilot and dedicated pilot. The receiver may derive a channel estimate for the data subbands based on a pilot received on the pilot subbands. The receiver may use the channel estimate to recover the data sent on the data subbands.<br>
[0039] The receiver may receive a transmission symbol from the transmitter in each symbol period. For each received transmission symbol, the receiver removes the cyclic prefix to obtain K input samples, performs a K-point DFT/FFT on the K input samples to obtain K frequency-domain received values, retains the received values for the T subbands used by the transmitter, and discards the remaining received values. For each received transmission symbol, the receiver obtains received pilot values for pilot subbands (if any) and received data values for data subbands (if any). The received pilot values are also called pilot observations.<br>
[0040] The received pilot values for a symbol period with pilot transmission may be expressed as:<br>
Rp(k) = P(k)-H(k) + N(k) ,	for  keKp,	Eq (1)<br>
where  P(k) is a transmitted pilot value for subband k;<br>
H(k) is a complex gain for the wireless channel for subband k;<br>
Rp(k) is a received pilot value for subband k;<br>
N(k) is the noise and interference for subband k; and<br>
Kp is the set of P pilot subbands.<br>
[0041] The received pilot values may be expressed in vector and matrix form as follows:<br>
r„=W-hp+n,	Eq(2)<br><br>
WO 2006/124810	 	PCT/US2006/018789<br>
where  rp is a Pxl vector containing P received pilot values for the P pilot subbands; W is a PxP diagonal matrix containing the P transmitted pilot values; hp is a Pxl vector containing the channel gains for the P pilot subbands; and n is a Pxl vector of noise and interference for the P pilot subbands.<br>
Matrix W may be defined to contain the P transmitted pilot values along the diagonal and zeros elsewhere, or diag {W} = [P(l), P(2), ..., P(P)].<br>
[0042] The wireless channel between the transmitter and the receiver may be characterized by either a time-domain channel impulse response or a frequency-domain channel frequency response. The channel impulse response may comprise L time-domain taps, h\, hi, ..., /JL, where L is typically much less than the number of pilot subbands, or L 
hp=Q-£,	Eq(3)<br>
where  Q is a PxL Fourier submatrix; and<br>
h_ is an Lxl vector containing L channel taps for the channel impulse response.<br>
A K x K Fourier matrix F contains K rows for the K total subbands and K columns for K time-domain samples. The (k,n) -th element of matrix F, fkn, is defined as:<br>
fkn = e-J2*«
Submatrix Q contains P rows of the Fourier matrix F corresponding to the P pilot<br>
subbands and the first L elements of these P rows.<br>
[0043]       The received pilot values may also be expressed as:<br>
r„=W-Q-A + n.	Eq (5)<br>
Equation (5) is obtained by substituting equation (3) into equation (2). <br>
[0044]      For MC-FDMA, P pilot symbols may be sent on the P pilot subbands, one pilot symbol on each subband.  Each transmitted pilot value is then equal to one pilot symbol.   The pilot symbols may be selected based on a modulation scheme (e.g., a phase shift keying (PSK) scheme such as BPSK or QPSK) that provides modulation<br><br>
WO 2006/124810	 	PCT/US2006/018789<br>
symbols having a constant amplitude.   In this case, the pilot symbols would have a<br>
constant envelope in frequency (i.e., a flat frequency response), and \P(k) j = l for all<br>
values of k.<br>
[0045]       For SC-FDMA, P pilot symbols may be transformed with a DFT/FFT as<br>
shown in FIG. 3A to obtain P frequency-domain pilot values, which are then sent on the<br>
P pilot subbands, one pilot value on each subband.  Even if the pilot symbols have a<br>
constant envelope in time, the resultant pilot values may not have a constant envelope in<br>
frequency due to the DFT/FFT operation. Hence, | P(k) | may not be equal to 1 for all<br>
values of k.<br>
[0046]       Matrix W accounts for the frequency-domain envelope of the transmitted<br>
pilot values.    The diagonal elements of W  may have different amplitudes if the<br>
transmitted pilot has a non-constant envelope in frequency, i.e., a non-flat frequency<br>
response.<br>
[0047]       The receiver may derive a channel estimate based on the received pilot<br>
values. This channel estimate may be a channel impulse response estimate or a channel<br>
frequency response estimate.   The receiver may derive the channel estimate using<br>
various techniques such as a least squares (LS) technique, minimum mean square error<br>
(MMSE) technique, and so on.<br>
[0048]       A channel impulse response estimate may be derived based on the least<br>
squares technique, as follows:<br>
4=[Q*-Ww-W-Q]-1-Q"-W"-r, ,	Eq(6)<br>
where A,, is a least-squares estimate of h, and """ denotes a conjugate transpose. <br>
[0049]       A channel impulse response estimate may also be derived based on the MMSE technique, as follows:<br>
L„« =[QW • Ww • W-Q + A]-1 Q" • W" -rp ,	Eq (7)<br>
where  A is a PxP covariance matrix of the noise and interference; and £„„„„ is an MMSE estimate of h.<br>
The covariance matrix may be given as   A-E{n-nH}, where   E{ }   denotes an expectation operation. The noise and interference may be assumed to be additive white<br><br>
WO 2006/124810	 	PCT/US2006/018789<br>
Gaussian noise (AWGN) with a zero mean vector and a covariance matrix of A = a\ I,<br>
where an is the variance or power of the noise and interference and I is the identity<br>
matrix.<br>
[0050]       Equations (6) and (7) may be implemented with DFT and EDFT operations,<br>
or FFT and IFFT operations if P and L are powers of two. Each matrix multiplication<br>
with Q may be performed with a DFT or FFT, and each matrix multiplication with Qw may be performed with an IDFT or IFFT. The channel impulse response estimate h_h or ftmmse may be used to derive a channel frequency response estimate for the data subbands or for all K total subbands.   For example, the channel impulse response<br>
A	A<br>
estimate hu or hmmse may be processed, e.g., to truncate some of the L channel taps, to zero out channel taps with low energy, and so on. The processed channel impulse response estimate may be zero padded to length K and then transformed with a K-point DFT/FFT to obtain a channel frequency response estimate for the K total subbands, as follows:<br>
h = F-|,	Eq(8)<br>
A<br>
where A is a Kx K vector for the padded channel impulse response estimate; and h is a KxK vector for the channel frequency response estimate.<br>
[0051] A channel frequency response estimate for the pilot subbands may also be derived based on the least squares technique, as follows:<br>
k,P =RW • W" -[W-R„ • W"r' -r, ,	Eq (9)<br>
where  R    is a P x P covariance matrix for the channel response vector h,,; and h,     is a least-squares estimate of hp .<br>
The covariance matrix R „ may be expressed as:<br><br>
E„=E{hp-h"p)<br><br>
Eq (10)<br><br>
WO 2006/124810	 	PCT/US2006/018789<br><br>
The covariance matrix Rpp contains complex values and may be determined based on a<br>
model for the wireless channel, computer simulation, empirical measurement, and so on. For example, the channel model may make certain assumptions about delay spread and/or Doppler for the wireless channel, and these assumptions may be used to obtain<br>
RPP-<br>
[0052]       A channel frequency response estimate for the pilot subbands may also be<br>
derived based on the MMSE technique, as follows:<br>
Km!e,P =EW • W" -[W-Rw • Ww +A]"1 -r, ,	Eq (11)<br>
where hmmse    is an MMSE estimate of hp.<br>
[0053] If the data subbands are the same as the pilot subbands (e.g., for transmission scheme 400 shown in FIG. 4A), then the channel estimate for the pilot subbands may be used directly for equalization, match filtering, and so on. If the data subbands are different from the pilot subbands (e.g., for transmission scheme 410 shown in FIG. 4B), or even if the data subbands and the pilot subbands are the same, a channel estimate may be derived for the data subbands based on either the channel estimate for the pilot subbands or the received pilot values and the weights.<br>
[0054] The frequency response for the P pilot subbands may be given by the Pxl vector hp, and the frequency response for the D data subbands may be given by a D x 1<br>
vector hrf. A DxP covariance matrix Rrfp may be defined as:<br>
Bu„=E{hd-hHp}.	Eq(12)<br>
The covariance matrix Rrf/) may also be determined based on a model for the wireless<br>
channel, computer simulation, empirical  measurement,  and so  on.     Recaptures<br>
variation in time as well, so that a channel estimate for the data subbands may be different than the channel estimate for the pilot subbands even if the data subbands are the same as the pilot subbands.<br>
[0055] A channel frequency response estimate for the data subbands may be derived based on the least squares technique, as follows:<br>
hw=Erfp-Ww-[W-Rw-Ww]-1-r^,	Eq(13)<br><br>
WO 2006/124810	 	PCT/US2006/018789<br><br>
where hbrf is a least squares estimate of hrf.<br>
[0056]       A channel frequency response estimate for the data subbands may also be derived based on the MMSE technique, as follows:<br>
!W =S* ' W" -[W-Rw • W* + A]"1 -r, ,	Eq (14)<br>
where hmmsed is an MMSE estimate of hrf.<br>
[0057] In equations (6) through (14), the channel estimates are derived with matrix W, which performs pilot weighting. In particular, the received pilot values for different subbands are weighted based on the transmitted pilot values. The received pilot values corresponding to transmitted pilot values with larger magnitudes are given more weight in the channel estimation, and the received pilot values corresponding to transmitted pilot values with smaller magnitudes are given less weight. This pilot weighting may result in a higher quality channel estimate.<br>
[0058] The channel estimation may also be performed based on the reliability or quality of the received pilot values. The noise and interference observed by the receiver may not be constant across all of the pilot subbands. This may be the case, for example, if an interfering transmitter (e.g., a transmitter in another sector or cell) transmits on only some of the pilot subbands, if the interfering transmitter uses different transmit powers for different pilot subbands, if the frequency response for the interfering transmitter is not flat across the pilot subbands, if different interfering transmitters transmit on different subsets of the pilot subbands, and so on. In any case, the noise and interference power may vary across the pilot subbands, which implies that some received pilot values are less reliable than others. <br>
[0059]       An interference estimate may be derived as follows:<br>
I(k) = \Rp(k)-P(k)-H(k)\2 ,	for keKp ,	Eq (15)<br>
where I(k) is the estimated noise and interference power for subband k (or simply, the<br>
estimated interference power) and H(k) is a channel gain estimate for subband k. The<br>
interference estimate may comprise an I(k) value for each pilot subband. Each I(k) value may also be obtained by averaging over multiple subbands and/or multiple symbol periods.<br><br>
WO 2006/124810	 	PCT/US2006/018789<br>
[0060] The channel gain estimate in equation (14) may be derived as described above, e.g., as shown in equation (9) or (11). Alternatively, the channel gain estimate may be derived for each subband k based on the MMSE technique, as follows:<br>
H(k) = , pK    ,.   V ,	for keKp ,	Eq (16)<br>
P(k) \2+NQ	p	J<br>
where N0 may be an initial estimate, an average estimate, or a long-term estimate of the<br>
noise and interference and " * " denotes a complex conjugate.<br>
[0061] An interference estimate may also be obtained by projecting the received pilot values on orthogonal dimensions. The receiver obtains P received pilot values for P pilot subbands. These P received pilot values constitute a vector in P-dimensional space and may, in principle, be used to estimate P parameters about the wireless channel. If there are L parameters for the wireless channel, then L dimensions of the P-dimensional vector may be used to estimate these P parameters, and P-L dimensions are available for interference estimation.   A PxP unitary matrix may be defined as<br>
V	= [lii !2&gt;-"'Ip] &gt; where v;, for je {1,...,P}, is a Pxl vector/column. The unitary<br>
matrix V is characterized by the property VH -V = I, which means that the columns of<br>
V	are orthogonal to one another and each column has unit power. The unitary matrix<br>
V	may be generated based on a channel model so that the channel variations are<br>
constrained to the first L columns of V. The last P-L columns of V may then be<br>
used for interference estimation since the channel is not present in these dimensions.<br>
The received vector rp may be projected onto each of the P-L vectors in  V as<br>
r" -Vy. The estimated interference power for each subband k may then be obtained by averaging across the different projections, as follows:<br>
&amp;) = -!—■   jrRl(k)-Vj(k) ,	fovkeKp,	Eq(17)<br>
r    L   ; = P_L+I<br>
where V}(k) is the element for subband k in vector v;.<br>
[0062] Regardless of how the interference estimate is derived, a reliability weight may be defined for each pilot subband based on the estimated interference power for that subband, as follows:<br><br>
WO 2006/124810	 	PCT/US2006/018789<br>
W(k) = f{I(k)} ,	forkeKp,	Eq (18)<br>
where / {/(£)} is a function that gives a larger weight for a smaller value of /(&amp;) and a smaller weight for a larger value of I(k). For example, the function may be defined as / {/(&amp;)} = a/I(k), where ais a constant value for all pilot subbands. <br>
[0063] The reliability weights may also be determined based on other information such as, e.g., knowledge of the interfering transmitters, knowledge of the channel conditions, and so on. For example, smaller weights may be given to subbands used by a strong interfering transmitter. The reliability weights may also be determined based on known information (e.g., for the interfering transmitter) without having to actually compute an interference estimate.<br>
[0064] A PxP diagonal matrix W, may be defined for the reliability of the P pilot<br>
subbands. For example, matrix W, may contain the reliability weights for the P pilot<br>
subbands        along        the        diagonal        and        zeros	elsewhere,        or<br>
diag {W,} = [W(l), W(2), ..., W(P)]. Matrix W, may then be used to derive a channel estimate, e.g., using any of the channel estimation equations given above, albeit with W, replacing W. Matrix W, would then perform reliability weighting and would give received pilot values with higher reliability more weight in the channel estimation and give received pilot values with less reliability less weight. This reliability weighting may result in a higher quality channel estimate. <br>
[0065]       A PxP diagonal matrix W_ , may also be defined based on the transmitted<br>
pilot values and the reliability weights. For example, the diagonal elements of matrix W„,, may be defined as diag{W^} = [W(l) ■ P(l), W(2)-P(2), ..., W(P)-P(P)]. Matrix<br>
WrJ may then be used to derive a channel estimate, e.g., using any of the channel<br>
estimation equations given above, albeit with W^, replacing W.<br>
[0066]       The interference estimate may also be used to derive covariance matrix A ,<br>
which is used to compute an MMSE channel estimate. In general, covariance matrix A<br>
may be derived based on a short-term or a long-term average of the interference<br>
estimate, a channel model, and so on.<br>
[0067]       The channel gain estimates may be used to derive an interference estimate,<br>
e.g., as shown in equation (14). Reliability weights may then be defined based on the<br><br>
WO 2006/124810	 	PCT/US2006/018789<br>
interference estimate and used to derive the channel gain estimates.    The channel estimation and interference estimation may be iteratively performed to improve the quality of the channel and interference estimates. <br>
[0068]       Iterative channel and interference estimation may be performed as follows:<br>
a.	Determine an initial interference estimate.<br>
b.	Compute reliability weights based on the initial interference estimate.<br>
1.	Compute matrix WPi/ based on the transmitted pilot values and the reliability<br>
weights.<br>
2.	Derive a channel estimate based on the received pilot values and matrix W ,.<br>
3.	Derive an interference estimate based on the received pilot values and the channel estimate.<br>
4.	Compute reliability weights based on the interference estimate.<br>
5.	Repeat steps 1 through 4 until a termination condition is encountered.<br>
Steps a and b are performed once.    The iterative process may terminate after a predetermined number of iterations.<br>
[0069] FIG. 5A shows a process 500 to derive a channel estimate with pilot weighting. A receiver receives at least one transmission symbol for a pilot transmitted by a transmitter (block 512). Each transmission symbol may be generated with a single-carrier multiplexing scheme (e.g., IFDMA, LFDMA or EFDMA) or a multi-carrier multiplexing scheme (e.g., OFDMA). The receiver removes the cyclic prefix and performs a DFT/FFT on each received transmission symbol to obtain received pilot values for pilot subbands (block 514). The receiver may estimate the reliability of the received pilot values, e.g., based on an interference estimate for the pilot subbands and/or other information (block 516). The receiver determines the weights for the received pilot values based on the transmitted pilot values, the estimated reliability of the received pilot values, other information, or a combination thereof (block 518). The receiver derives a channel estimate based on the received pilot values and the weights (block 520). This channel estimate may be a channel impulse response estimate and/or a channel frequency response estimate. The receiver may derive the channel estimate using the least-squares technique, the MMSE technique, or some other channel estimation technique. The receiver may iteratively perform channel and interference estimation.   If pilot and data are transmitted on different subbands, then the receiver<br><br>
WO 2006/124810	 <br><br>
PCT/US2006/018789<br><br>
may derive a channel estimate for the data subbands based on the channel estimate for the pilot subbands (e.g., as shown in equation (8)) or based on the received pilot values and the weights (e.g., as shown in equation (13) or (14)).<br>
[0070] The receiver then performs data detection (e.g., equalization, match filtering, or receiver spatial processing) on received data values with the channel estimate (block 522). For example, the receiver may perform equalization in the frequency domain based on the MMSE technique, as follows:<br><br>
_Rd(k)-H\k)<br>
\H(k)\2+N0<br>
z*(*) = VX,;,2 Jv •	for ke K* »<br><br>
where R,,(k) is a received data value for subband k, Zd(k) is a detected data value for<br>
subband k, and Kd is the set of data subbands. The interference estimate N0 in equation<br>
(18) may be obtained by averaging the estimated interference powers for the pilot subbands, as follows:<br>
o=~X'W-	Eq(20)<br>
[0071] FIG. 5B shows an apparatus 500 to derive a channel estimate with pilot weighting. Means 562 for processing receiver receives at least one transmission symbol for a pilot transmitted by a transmitter. Each transmission symbol may be generated with a single-carrier multiplexing scheme (e.g., IFDMA, LFDMA or EFDMA) or a multi-carrier multiplexing scheme (e.g., OFDMA). Means 562 may be coupled with means 564 for performing a DFT/FFT, or a similar functionality, on each received transmission symbol to obtain received pilot values for pilot subbands. In certain aspects, means 562 and 564 may be embodied as a single means. Means 564, or 562, may be coupled with means 566 for estimating the reliability of the received pilot values, e.g., based on an interference estimate for the pilot subbands and/or other information. Means 566 may be coupled with means 568 for determining the weights for the received pilot values based on the transmitted pilot values, the estimated reliability of the received pilot values, other information, or a combination thereof. In certain aspects, means 566 may be part of means 568, or may be omitted from the apparatus and means 568 may be coupled with means 564 or 562, depending on their structure..<br><br>
WO 2006/124810	 	PCT/US2006/018789<br><br>
[0072] Means 568 is coupled with means 570 for deriving a channel estimate based on the received pilot values and the weights. This channel estimate may be a channel impulse response estimate and/or a channel frequency response estimate. The receiver may derive the channel estimate using the least-squares technique, the MMSE technique, or some other channel estimation technique. The receiver may iteratively perform channel and interference estimation. If pilot and data are transmitted on different subbands, then the receiver may derive a channel estimate for the data subbands based on the channel estimate for the pilot subbands (e.g., as shown in equation (8)) or based on the received pilot values and the weights (e.g., as shown in equation (13) or (14)).<br>
[0073] Means 570 may be coupled with means 572 for performing data detection (e.g., equalization, match filtering, or receiver spatial processing) on received data values with the channel estimate. In certain aspects means 572 may be omitted from the apparatus, and performed in other structures of a receiver.<br>
[0074] FIG. 6 shows an embodiment of demodulator 160 and channel estimator/ processor 180 at receiver 150 in FIG. 1. Within demodulator 160, a cyclic prefix removal unit 610 receives input samples for transmission symbols received by receiver 150 and removes the cyclic prefix in each received transmission symbol. A DFT unit 612 performs a DFT or an FFT on the input samples for each received transmission symbol and provides frequency-domain received values. A demultiplexer (Demux) 614 provides received data values from data subbands to a data detector 616 and provides received pilot values from pilot subbands to channel estimator/processor 180. The operation of demultiplexer 614 is controlled by a control signal, e.g., from controller/ processor 190.<br>
[0075] Within channel estimator/processor 180, an interference estimator 622 derives an interference estimate based on the received pilot values and possibly a channel estimate from a channel estimator 620. A weight computation unit 624 computes the weights for the received pilot values based on the transmitted pilot values and/or the interference estimate. Channel estimator 620 derives the channel estimate based on the received pilot values and the weights. The channel and interference estimation may be performed iteratively. After completion of the channel estimation, channel estimator 620 provides the channel estimate to data detector 616. <br>
[0076] Data detector 616 may perform frequency-domain equalization on the received data values with the channel estimate (e.g., as shown in equation (18)) and<br><br>
WO 2006/124810	 	PCT/US2006/018789<br>
provide detected data values. Data detector 616 may also perform time-domain equalization or some other type of data detection. If the transmission symbols are sent with SC-FDMA, then an IDFT unit 618 performs an IDFT or an IFFT on the detected data values for each symbol period and provides data symbol estimates. If the transmission symbols are sent with MC-FDMA, then data detector 616 provides the detected data values as the data symbol estimates.<br>
[0077] The data symbol estimates are further processed to obtain decoded data. For example, log likelihood ratios (LLRs) may be derived based on the data symbol estimates, the channel estimate, and the interference estimate. Each modulation symbol is formed with B bits, where B &gt; 1. An LLR is computed for each bit of a transmitted modulation symbol based on the corresponding data symbol estimate, channel gain estimate, and estimated interference power. The LLR for each bit indicates the confidence in that bit and hence determines the weight given to that bit in the decoding process. The interference estimate may take into account the noise in the channel estimate, so that data subbands with more noisy channel gain estimates and hence higher interference powers are given less weight in the LLRs computation. The LLRs are deinterleaved and decoded to obtain the decoded data.<br>
[0078] The pilot transmission and channel estimation techniques described herein may be implemented by various means. For example, these techniques may be implemented in hardware, software, or a combination thereof. For a hardware implementation, the processing units used for pilot transmission at a transmitter (e.g., TX data and pilot processor 120 in FIG. 1) may be implemented within one or more application specific integrated circuits (ASICs), digital signal processors (DSPs), digital signal processing devices (DSPDs), programmable logic devices (PLDs), field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), processors, controllers, micro-controllers, microprocessors, electronic devices, other electronic units designed to perform the functions described herein, or a combination thereof. The processing units used for channel estimation at a receiver (e.g., demodulator 160 and/or channel estimator/ processor 180 in FIGS. 1 and 6) may also be implemented within one or more ASICs, DSPs, processors, and so on.<br>
[0079] For a software implementation, the techniques may be implemented with modules (e.g., procedures, functions, and so on) that perform the functions described herein.   The software codes may be stored in a memory (e.g., memory 142 or 192 in<br><br>

ABSTRACT<br>
PILOT TRANSMISSION AND CHANNEL ESTIMATION WITH PILOT WEIGHTING<br>
Techniques to perform channel estimation with pilot weighting are described. A receiver receives at least one transmission symbol for a pilot transmitted by a transmitter. Each transmission symbol may be generated with a single-carrier multiplexing scheme (e.g., IFDMA or LFDMA) or a multi-carrier multiplexing scheme (e.g., OFDMA). The receiver processes each received transmission symbol and obtains received pilot values. The receiver may derive an interference estimate based on the received pilot values and may estimate the reliability of the received pilot values based on the interference estimate. The receiver determines weights for the received pilot values based on the transmitted pilot values, the estimated reliability of the received pilot values, and/or other information. The receiver derives a channel estimate based on the received pilot values and the weights. The receiver then performs data detection (e.g., equalization) on received data values with the channel estimate.<br></td>
