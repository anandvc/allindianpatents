T ext ile  machine<br>
The invention relates to a textile machine with a multiplicity of winding stations for winding a multiplicity of threads according to the preamble of clai m 1.<br>
It    is    known    that,     after    treatment    and    processing    of threads,    these   are   wound,    for   storage,    onto   a    bobbin. Thus,   textile   machines   of   this   type  have  a   multiplicity of    winding   stations,    in    order   in    each   of    the   winding stations    to   wind    one   of    the   thr eads    ont o    on e   of    the bobbins.     For    this    purpos e,     the    winding    stations    ar e arranged    one   above   the   other   in   a   plurality   of   tiers and   next    to   one   another    along    a    machine   longitudinal side.     In    the   case    of    false-twist    texturing    machines, such    as     are    known,     for     example,     from   WO    03/091140, three    winding     stations     are    arranged     one     above    the other,     since   the   winding    stations    have    essentially   a width   of   three  of   the pr ec eding  pr oc essing   stations.<br>
Textile machines of this type have auxiliary devices f or carrying out a bobbin change in each cas e in the winding stations when the wound bobbin has reached a predetermined size. The auxiliary devices can in this case be designed as a function of the servicing of the winding stations, so that automatic or manual bobbin changes can be carried out. In this case, irrespective of the design of the auxiliary devices, while the bobbin change is being carried out, the continuously supplied threads are picked up and routed to a waste c ont ain er.<br>
For this purpos e, in the t extile mac hin e known from WO 03/091140, a central waste container is used, to which a main injector is connect ed with its blast end. The suction c onnection of the main in j ect or is in this case utilized in order, -as required, to pick up and discharge   the   threads   at    each   of   the  winding   stations<br><br>
by means of a suction pipe. This system is preferably used for textile machines with an automatic bobbin change, in order to ensure a discharge of the thr eads at   any time at   each   of   the winding  stations.<br>
A textile machine with a multiplicity of winding stations is known from US 2,20 6,834, in which the winding stations ar e assign ed auxiliary d evic es with a plurality of thread inj actors. The thread injectors are divid ed into groups and are assigned in each cas e to on e of a pluralit y of wast e containers. This gives rise, depending on the multiplicity of winding stations, to a multiplicit y of wast e contain ers which in each case have to be supplied, in particular emptied,   independently  of   one another.<br>
The    object    of    the   invention,    then,    is    to   develop    a textile   rrachine  of   the  generic   type in   such   a  way that, particularly    when      rrHnual     bobbin     changes      ar e     being carried   out,    an   individual   and   efficient   serviceability of   each   of   the winding  stations   is   ensured,<br>
A further aim of the invention is to ensure the servicing sequence for a bobbin change on a textile machine with a multiplicit y of winding stations at as low   an   outlay as   possible in   servicing  terms.<br>
This obj act is achieved, according to the invention, by means of a textile machine having the features according to claim 1,<br>
Advantageous developments are defined by the features and  feature combinations   of   the subclaims.<br>
The invention departs from the principle whereby the pipelines used in the textile machine for discharging yarn wast e are coupl ed to fixed c onn act ions on an inlet side and on an outlet side. In contrast, the invention makes     it     possibl e    that    the    pr edominant     part     of    the<br><br>
auxiliary devices used for a bobbin change are inoperable on account of the absence of connections. Since auxiliary devices of this type are utilized only in the event of a bobbin change within the winding station, the invention advantageously links the set-up of the apparatus to the servicing outlay. Thus, the wast e c ont ain er is d esign ed t o be moveabl e and has a contain er c onnecti on which can be connect ed alt ernat ely to the pipelines of the thr ead suction means by a r el easabl e c oupling member. Thus, only the winding station at which a bobbin change has to be carri ed out is designed to have an operable auxiliary device. The invention thus af f ords the possibilit y of designing particularly cost -effective cone epts f or auxiliary devic es f or carrying out bobbin changes in the t extile machine. Tying up the waste container directly to the winding stations ensur es that the thread wast e is transport ed away r el i ably by the thread suction means. The bridging of long distances is thereby avoided, so that correspondingly low conveying pressur es ar e sufficient for discharging the thread waste quickly and reliably during the bobbin  change.<br>
In the case of a large number of winding stations, it is necessary that the waste container is alternately connectable quickly and reliably by simple means for the bobbin changes. For this purpose, the development of the invention has proved particularly appropriate in which the coupling member consists of a moveable clutch carrier and of a stationary clutch plat e which are quickly connected releasably to one another. In this cas e, the clutch carri er f or r ec eiving the c ont ain er c onn ection is c onn ected to the waste container and can be 1 ead in a mobile way from one coupling point t o another. By contrast, the clutch plate is designed to be stationary and f or ms the connection of at 1 east on e of the pipelines, a plurality of clutch plat es being arranged, distribut ed, on the machine longitudinal sid e so     as      in      each     case     to     form     a     coupling      point.<br><br>
Consequently, the activation of the auxiliary devices at the winding stations directly preceding the bobbin change can take place quickly and reliably. To couple the respective connections within the clutch carriers and clutch plat e, in this case conventional and known quick-action  coupling  systems   may be used.<br>
In the event that manual bobbin change is to be carried out simultaneously on a plurality of adjacent winding stations, the development of the textile irechine according to the invention in which the pipelines of a plurality of thread suction means are connected to a fixed clutch plat e affords particular advantages. The container connection of the waste container is in this cas e f or med on a clutch carri er which is connect ed r eleasably to the clutch plat e. Cons equently, a pluralit y of thread suction means can be conn ect ed to the wast e contain er si mult an eously by means of on e c onn ect ion.<br>
In the case of a multiplicity of thread suction means, in particular the development of the invention has proved appropriat e in which the thread suction means are divided into a pluralit y of suction groups, the pipelines led to one of the suction groups being connected to one of a plurality of clutch plates, and in which the clutch plates are arranged, distributed at a distance from one another, on the machine longitudinal sides. A rapid change for the simultaneous tie-up of a plurality of thread suction means can consequently be carried   out.<br>
Preferably,    in   this   case,   the winding   stations   arranged on e   above   the   other   in   a   column   are   suppli ed   by   means of    one   suction    group.     There   is    also   the   possibility, however,      of    combining    adjacent     binding    stations     one above the other  and next  to  one another  into a  group.<br><br>
According to one preferred development of the invention, the suction means f or picking up and discharging the threads in the winding stations ar e formed by station injectors which are connected with a blast end to one of the pipelines. The suction end of the station injector in this case forms the thread inlet, the direct air inflow of the station injector in the vicinity of the thread inlet leading to a reliable and   rapid   pick-up   and  discharge  of   the thread.<br>
When station in j ect ors ar e us ed, it is necessary f or the supply of compressed air to the station injector to be activated after the coupling of the waste container. This may take plac e, f or example, by means of a manual actuating valve assign ed to the station in j ect or. By c ontrast, a particularly advantageous r ef in ement is f or med by virtue of the d ev el op ment ace ordin g to the invention of the t extile machine in which in each cas e a pr essur e conn ection and at least one s eparat e pressure line are formed on the clutch plate, the pressure line being connected to the station injectors assigned to the respective clutch plate. By contrast, the clutch carrier, cooperating with the clutch plate, of the waste container contains a connection means by which the pressure lin e is conn ected to the pr essur e connection during coupling together. Cons equent ly, when the wast e contain er is connect ed, the supply of compressed air to the connected station injectors can be activated  simultaneously.<br>
So that, after a bobbin change, the threads can be pieced up again in succession in the winding stations, the thread is normally guided in the winding station by means of a manual thread suction gun. In this case, the development of the textile machine according to the invention has proved particularly appropriate in which, for the manual guidance of the threads, the mobile thread   suction   gun   is   connect ed   directly   by   means   of   a<br><br>
discharge hose to the waste container to rorm a s ervicing  unit.<br>
The supply of compressed air to the thread suction gun can in this case advantageously be irrpleiuent ed via the clutch carrier, so that the pressure line of the thread suction   gun   is  connected  to the clutch carrier.<br>
The supply of corrpressed air transferred from the clutch plate to the clutch carrier may in this case take plac e by means of a s eparat e c orrpr ess ed air connection solely for the supply of the thread suction gun or by means of a c entral corrpr ess ed air connection in the clutch plate, by means of which both the thread gun and the station inj ect ors are suppli ed with c orrpr ess ed   air.<br>
However,	the        t hr ead        s uc t i on        mean s	ma y        also<br>
advantageously be formed by a suction pipe which issues at one end into one of the pipelines. The auxiliary devices for discharging the yarn waste can therefore be f or med, within the winding stations, by simple pipe systems.<br>
In order to cause the vacuum generating the suction stream to act in the suction pipes, there is the possibility of additionally forming on the clutch plate a suction air connection which can be coupled to the wast e container via a s eparat e c ontainer c onn ect ion on the clutch carrier. Thus a vacuum, which is propagated via the second separate container connection into the pipelines and suction pipes, can be generated in the waste container  via  the suction   air  connection.<br>
There is also the possibility, however, that the waste container cooperates directly with a waste injector which can be activated via a pressure connection by means   of   the coupling   member.<br><br>
For further servicing optimization, it is proposed to arrange along the machine longitudinal side a guide rail on which a moveable guide means is guided. The guide means contains devices for holding the servicing unit. To that extent, the rapid changes of the waste contain er can be carri ed out without an att end ant having  to   expend   great   effort.<br>
In this case, the waste container can preferably be formed by a waste bag, so that simple handling is possible. Moreover, the material of the waste bag could be coordinated with the thread mterial, so that the yarn waste could be disposed, together with the waste bag,   and   r ec yc 1 ed.<br>
Further advantages of the textile machine according to the invention are explain ed in more detail below by means of some exemplary embodi ments , with r ef er enc e t o the  ace ompanying  figures   in   which:<br>

fig. 6 illustrate diagramirBtically a view of a detail of further exemplar y embodi ments of the t extile machine according  to the invention.<br>
Figs 1 and 2 illustrate a first exemplary embodiment of the t extile machine according to the invention. Fig. 1 in this cas e shows a cross -s actional vi ew of the textile machine which consists of a multipart machine stand 7, the stand parts of the machine stand 7 forming a s er vicing aisle 21. Directly next to the machin e stand 7 is arranged a cr eel stand 6 which c ontains a pluralit y  of   f eed   stations   1   with  f eed   bobbins   2.<br>
The textile machine has in the longitudinal direction -in fig. 1 the drawing plane is identical to the transverse plane ( - a mult ip lie it y of proc essing stations in order in each cas e to t extur e a thr ead in each processing station. The winding stations within the t extile machine occupy a width of three proc essing stations, so that in each case three winding stations 10.1, 10.2 and 10.3 are arranged in tier form one above the  other   in   a  colurm   in  the  machine stand   7.<br>
The cross-s ectional vi ew il lust rat ed in fig. 1 ther ef or e il lust rat es the thr ead run in one of the processing stations, the devices required for the take-up, guidance, treatment and winding of the thread 11 being arranged on the machine stand 7 so as to form a thread run partially surrounding the servicing aisle 21.<br>
The devices are briefly described below in terms of the thread run in on e proc essing station. To tak e up the thread 11 in the processing station from a feed bobbin 2 held in the creel stand 6, a take-up deliver y unit 3 is provided. The tak e-up delivery unit 3 is f oil owed in the thread run by a heating device 4, a cooling device 5, a texturing device 8, a drawing delivery unit 9, a twisting   devic e   13,    a   pr es et    delivery   unit    20 ,    a    s et<br><br>
heating device 19, a set delivery unit 14 and one of the winding stations 10.1 to 10.3* The abovementioned d evic es may in this cas e be d esigned and driven as individual assemblies per processing station or as multiple assemblies   of   a   group   of   processing  stations.<br>
The winding stations 10.1 to 10.3 arranged one above the other and belonging to three adjacent processing stations comprise in each case a bobbin holder 18 on which is held and wound a bobbin 12 which is driven, during winding, via a driving roller 17. The driving roller 17 is preceded in the thr ead run by a traversing devic e, not il lust rat ed in any more detail here, which guides the thr ead back and forth within a traversing stroke before it is deposited on the bobbin, so that a cross-wound   bobbin   is  wound   in  the winding  station.<br>
For a further explanation of the winding stations, reference is mad e at the same time to fig. 2 in addition ,to fig. 1. Fig, 2 in this case shows a view of the winding station arranged along a machine longitudinal side 39, only the first nine winding stations 10,1 to 10.9 being illustrated in fig. 2. The machine longitudinal side 39 in this case extends parallel to the servicing aisle 21, from which an attendant carries out the bobbin changes at the winding stations   10. 1   to  10. 9.<br>
The winding stations 10. 1 to 10. 9 are assigned a plurality of auxiliary devices 22.1 to 22.3, by means of which it becomes possible for the bobbin changes to be carried out. The auxiliary devices 22.1 to 22.3 are in each case assigned to a group of winding stations, so that the auxiliary device 22.1 is assigned to the winding stations 10.1 to 10.3, the auxiliary device 22.2 to the winding stations 10.4 to 10.6 and the auxiliary device 22,3 to the winding stations 10,7 to 10. 9.<br><br>
The auxiliary devices 22.1 to 22.3 are designed identically in their set-up, so that only the set-up of the auxiliary device 22.1 is explained in more detail below. The auxiliary d evic e 22.1 contains thread suction means 16 for picking up the threads while a bobbin change is being carried out. The thread suction means 16 are formed by a plurality of station injectors 23.1 to 23.3. The station injectors 23.1 to 23.3 are in each case connect ed to a clutch plat e 31 via separat e pipelines 24.1, 24.2 and 24.3. For this purpose, the clutch plate 31 is fast en ed in the lower region of the mchine stand 7. To supply compressed air to the station injectors 23.1 to 23.3, the clutch plate 31 has c onnect ed to it a pressure line 25 which is c onn ect ed to the station injectors 23. 1 to 23. 3 via branches* In addition to the conn ect i ons of the pipelines 2 4.1 to 24.3 and to the connection of the pressure line 25, the clutch plate 31 has f or mod in it a c ompr ess ed air connection 30 which is coupled to a compressed air supply 26. The pressure connection 30 within the clutch plate 31 is closed so that the station injectors 23,1 to 23.2 are in a pressureless state, and therefore no suction actions prevail at the suction ports of the station   in j ect ors*<br>
As il lust rat ed in fig. 2, the auxiliary d evic es 22.1 and 22.2 are inoperative, and therefore no bobbin changes can be carried out at the winding stations 10.1 to  10. 6.<br>
By contrast, the auxiliary device 22.3 is operationally r eady for carrying out a bobbin change in winding stations 10.7 to 10.9. For this purpose, a servicing unit 40, consisting of a wast e container 28 and of a suction gun 15, is connect ed to the auxiliary devic e 23.3   via   a  coupling   member   27.<br>
The coupling member 27 between the auxiliary devic e 22.3   and   the  servicing   unit   40   is    explained   below   with<br><br>
r ef er enc e to fig, 3 and 4, fig. 3 showing a cross -sectional view of the connection between the auxiliary device 22.3 and the servicing unit 40, and fig. 4 showing a detail of the connection in the region of the pressure connection   30.<br>
The s er vicing unit 40 c on tains a wast e container 28 with a c ontain er c onn ecti on 2 9 f or r ec eiving thr ead wast e. The container connection 29 is in this case formed on a clutch carrier 32. The clutch carrier 32 is conn ectable to the clutch plate 31 in such a way that the connections of the pipelines 24. 7 to 24. 9 issue directly in the contain er c onn ect ion 29, so that threads 11 guided through the pipelines 24.7 to 24.9 are led directly into the wast e container 28. The container connection 2 9 is designed to be releasable so that the wast e contain er 28 can be moved from the c lutch  carri er   32   for   errpt ying   or  changing.<br>
The clutch carri er 32 has formed in it a c ount erpr essur e connection 3 4 which cooper at es with the pressure connection 30 when the clutch carrier 32 is coupled  to the clutch  plate 31.<br>
Fig. 4 illustrates the situation shortly before the clutch plate 31 is coupled together with the clutch carrier 32. The pressure connection 30 in the clutch plate 31 is shutoff via a nonreturn valve 35. In the c ount erpr essur e connection 34 of the clutch carrier 32, a tappet 36 is arranged, which projects with a free end into the pressure c onn ect ion 30 and, when the clutch plate 31 is closed together with the clutch carrier 32, leads   to the  opening   of   the pressure connection   30.<br>
Thus, when the clutch carrier 32 is being uncoupled from the clutch plate 31, the pressure connection 30 is c los ed automatically by the nonreturn valve 35, when the tappet   36   is   led   out.<br><br>
As        illustrated        in        fig.    3,	the       c ount erpr essur e<br>
connection 34 leads directly into the pressure line 38, in order to supply corrpr ess ed air to a thr ead suction gun 15 connected to the pressure line 38* The thread suction gun 15 is connected to the container connection 29 of the waste container 28 via a discharge hose 37. The waste container 28 can thus pick up in order to pick up the yarn wast e which is suppli ed by means of the station injectors 23. 7 to 23. 9 or via the thread suction   gun   15   (see also fig.    2).<br>
As il lust rat ed in fig. 3, the clutch carri er 32 has a c onn ect i on lin e 33 which is d esign ed as a c onn ect i on means which, in the c oupled stat e, c onn ects the c ount erpr essur e connection 3 4 to the conn ection of the pr essur e lin e 25 in the clutch plat e 31. Thus, at the same ti me, the corrpr ess ed air discharged from the pr essur e connection 30 pass es via the c onn ec ting line 32 into the pressure line 25, so that the thr ead injectors 23.7 to 23.9 are supplied with compressed air. The auxiliary device 22.3 is thus switched to operational si nply by the coupling of the s er vicing unit 40. The bobbin-changing operation can be carri ed out   in  the winding  stations   10*7   to  10.9.<br>
In this case, the winding operation in the winding stations 10.7 to 10.9 is interrupted manually, and the severed threads are transferred into the suction ports of the station injectors 23. 7 to 23. 9. The bobbins can then be extracted from the winding stations 10.7 to 10. 9 and replaced by empt y tubes. For the piecing up, the attendant takes over the threads 11, in each case individually, by means of the thread suction gun 15 and guides them to the new tube, so that, after they have been  caught,   a  new  winding   operati on  can  c ommenc e.<br>
As soon as the bobbin change in the winding stations 10.7 to 10.9 is terminated, the coupling member 27 is released    by  the   separation    of   the  clutch   plate   31    and<br><br>
the    clutch    carrier     32,     and    the    serving    unit     40     is brought   to   the   next   coupling   point.    For   this   purpose, the   servicing   unit   40    my   be  designed   to   be  capable   of traveling,      in     order     to     be     guided     as      a     s er vicing trolley.<br>
In the exemplary embodi ment, shown in fig. 1 and fig. 2, of the textile machine according to the invention, the waste container 28 is formed by a waste bag. The waste bag is preferably formed from a material which can be r ec ycled t ogether with the yarn wast e. When the waste container is full, only an exchange of the wast e bags is r equir ed at the s er vicing unit, and therefore short and very quick changes can be carried out.<br>
Fig.    5     shows     a    further     exemplary    embodi ment     of     the<br>
t extile	machine	ace or ding	to	the	invention<br>
diagrammatic ally in a cross -s ectional vi ew of the winding stations. In this case, the winding stations 10. 1 to 10. 3 arranged one above the other in tier form are identif i ed diagrammatic ally by the illustration of a bobbin 12. Each winding station 10.1 to 10.3 is assign ed in each cas e a thread suction means 16 f or med in this case by suction pipes 42. The suction pipes 42 are connected to the stationary part of the coupling member 27 via a pipeline 24. Arranged on the stationary part of the coupling member 27, next to the pipeline 24, is a suction connection 47 which is connected to a blower   41.<br>
To pick up the yarn waste, the waste container 28 has two container connections 29.1 and 29.2 which are f or med on the moveabl e part of the c oupling member 27. In the coupled state of the coupling member 27, the container connection 29.1 matches with the suction connection 47 and the container connection 2 9.2 with the connection of the pipeline 24. Thus, within the wa«t P&gt;   r nnt.R-i n er   28 .    a   vacuum   is    aenerat ed    which    1 eads<br><br>
to a suction action in the pipeline 2 4 and in the suction pipes 42 included in it. In this state, the threads running in at the winding stations 10.1 to 10.3 can   be  led  continuously into the waste container   28.<br>
So that the waste container 28 can be guided along the machine longitudinal side to adjacent winding stations, the waste container 28 is held on a guide rail 43 via a guide slide 44. As a result, by the guide slide 4 4 being displaced on the guide rail 43, an attendant can carry  out   a  rapid  change  of   the winding  station.<br>
Fig. 6 shows a further exemplary embodi ment of the textile machine according to the invention, the winding stations 10. 1 to 10. 3 arranged one above the other in tier form being identified symbolically by the illustration of a bobbin. Each of the winding stations 10. 1 to 10. 3 is assigned a suction pipe 42 as thread suction means. The suction pipes 42 are connected to the stati onar y part of the coupling member 27 via the pipelin e 2 4. The coupling member 27 has, s eparat ely from the pipeline connection, a pr essur e c onn ecti on 30 which is connected to a pressure source, not il lust rat ed  here.<br>
To generate a suction stream, a waste injector 45 is arranged on the waste c ontain er 28. The wast e in j ect or 45 is connected to the coupling member 27 via a container connection 29 and a c ount erpr essur e c onnection   34.<br>
In the coupled state, the waste injector 45 is supplied with compressed air via the pressure connection 30 and the c ount erpr essur e c onn ecti on 3 4. The suction str earn generated in this case on the suction side of the waste injector 45 is routed via the pipeline 24 and the container connection 29 via the suction ports present at   the free  end   of   the suction  pipes   42.<br><br>
In addition to the waste injector 45, a thread suction gun 15 is conn ected to the pressure c onnection 30 via the pressure line 38. The blast end of the thread suction gun 15 issues directly into the waste container 28 via the discharge hose 37, so that a corrplete servicing unit 40 for the bobbin change and for the new pi ecing up of the thr eads in the winding stations 10. 1 to 10.3 is afforded. In this exerrplary embodiment, the servicing unit 40 is held and guided by means of a carriage 46. For this purpose/ the waste container 28 is arranged directly on the carriage 46. The wast e c ontainer 28 nay be designed both rigidly and flexibly, f or exairpl e as a wast e bag. Depending on its design, the wast e c ontain er 28 may be connect ed r eleasably to the carriage 46. It is also possible, however, that the wast e container 28 r errains on the carriage 46 and can be  open ed  f or   errpt ying.<br>
The exerrplary embodi ments f or the t extil e machine, according to the invention are illustrative in terms of the s et -up and arrang ement of their d evic es f or the treatment, processing and winding of the threads. The set-up of a false-twist texturing machine according to fig. 1 was s elect ed, sine e the invention has proved particularly appropriat e in such t extile machines, sine e fa Is e-twist t extil e machines usually have a large number of pr oc essing stations and therefore long routing  distances   of   the servicing   unit   are  afforded.<br>
Irrespective of the design of the textile machine, the invention possesses the particular advantage that all the energy supply of the servicing unit is provided in each cas e at the c oupling point. A per man ent supply of energy to the s er vicing unit, f or example by means of energy chains, is not r equir ed. This ensures the high flexibility, required for mnual servicings, for the discharge of yarn waste during a bobbin change and thread   handling  during  n ew   pi ecing  up.<br><br>
In the exenplar y embodi ments of the t extile rracnm e according to the invent i on which are shown in figs 2, 5 and 6, the auxiliary devic es have a thread suction means per winding station. However, the invention also ext ends to such variants of t extile irachin es in which a plurality of winding stations arranged next to one an ot h er and /or on e a bov e the other are assigned to one thread suction means. Thus, a plurality of threads can be discharged si mult an eously by one thread suction means.<br>
Moreover, the servicing unit, together with the waste container, can also advantageously be guided above the floor in a region above the winding on the textile machine. The change between the individual docking positions in the t extile machine is pr ef erably carri ed out manually. However, automatic sequences are also possibl e*<br><br>
