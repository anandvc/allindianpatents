				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The  invention relates  to an improved process for producing weldable quality steel of increased  yield  strength and corrosion resistance.<br>
The  invention relates  more  particularly to  a process for producing weldable quality steel  of corrosion  resistance higher than that  of  carbon structural  steel  and  minimum yield strength of 340 MPa,   to make the  same  suitable for use  in the construction  of bridges,  buildings  and various  other equipment which are vulnerable to  corrosion by atmosphere  and/or flue gases using  primary steel  of relatively high sulphur content i.e. 0.04% and  above by weight  as  the  starting material.<br>
The  existing  process for producing steel  for the abovementioned  applications  comprises  preparation  of molten steel  of relatively low sulphur content i.e.  less than  0.03% by weight  in a basic  oxygen furnace   (BOF);   addition of  alloying elements  such as  carbon,  manganese  and vanadium in  a relatively high  proportion to the molten steel   in  a vacuum are degassing (VAD)  ladle;   continuous  casting   (CC)  of the molten steel  into slabs;  hot rolling  of the  slabs  into strips  in horizontal slabbing machine   (HSM);  hot finishing  and  coiling  of  the  strips; and  cooling the coils  to ambient temperature.<br>
The main drawbacks  of  the  existing  process  are that because  of addition  of the  alloying  elements,   particularly carbon,   manganese  and vanadium in  a relatively high  proportion to  the  molten steel  the weldability  and  corrosion  resistance properties  of the  steel  produced  are  adversely affected  and that the  cost  of  production is  increased  owing to the  addition<br>
-     2     -<br><br>
of the relatively expensive alloying elements like manganese and vanadium in increased proportion to the molten steel in ladle.<br>
The objective of the present invention is to provide an improved process for producing weldable quality steel plates of increased yield strength and corrosion resistance at a reduced cost from primary steel containing a relatively high percentage of sulphur by weight i.e.  0.04% and above.<br>
The  invented process has been developed by conducting extensive research work in laboratory,   followed by plant level trials and evaluation of the end use performance of the product. The  basic steps followed in the  invented process are  :-<br>
(i)      determining the chemical composition of the steel suitable for meeting the end use  requirements;<br>
(ii)      producing primary steel of sulphur content 0.04% and above  (by weight)  in a BOF and adding ferro-alloys and alloying metals to the molten steel  in a ladle;<br>
(iii)      producing refined secondary steel  ingots by Argon rinsing of the molten steel  in the ladle and casting in a mould with addition of misch metal to the  molten steel at the time of teeming the same into the mould;  and<br>
(iv)      soaking,  slabbing,  scarfing,   controlled hot rolling and coiling,  and cooling.<br>
Distinguishing features of the present invention v/ith reference to prior art are  :-<br>
(i)      As compared to maximum specified carbon content of 0.19% for this grade  of steel  (ASTM 588),   carbon content is limited to be in the range  of 0.08 to 0.15 percent in the  invented process<br>
-    3    -<br><br>
for ensuring increased weldability of the steel produced.<br>
(ii)      To minimise the adverse effect of increased sulphur content,   the  molten steel  is tapped from L.D.   convertor (BOF) with reduced sulphur content of about 0.04% by treating the steel with Misch metal during its transfer from BOF to ladle to convert the sulphide  inclusions into globular shape particles,  which improves the ductility of steel.     In other words, even if proper desulfurisation facilities is not available in the plant,  and the sulphur level of steel is as high as 0.04%,   it is possible  in the invented process to get good ductility by treating steel with Misch metal.<br>
(iii)      Cr-Si containing steels,  like the  one produced,  have a tendency to form sticky scale  during reheating  of the slabs for hot rolling.   The problem is overcome in the  invented process by maintaining a controlled amount of oxygen (0.5%)  in the reheating furnace  for forming a non-sticky scale on the  steel,  which can be easily removed during high pressure descaling  operation.<br>
(iv)      By using 870 ± 10°C temperature as hot finishing temperature along with delayed cooling on the  run out table  (ROT), followed by coiling at a temperature of 640 ± 10°C,   a fine grain pearlite-ferrite grain structure steel which has higher yield strength and toughness,as compared to steel produced in the prior art,  is produced.<br>
The  invented process is described fully and particularly in an unrestricted manner with reference to the accompanying drawings in which Figure 1   is a flow diagram<br>
-    3A    -<br><br>
depicting the various steps followed  in sequence in the invented  process   :<br>
Referring to Fig.  1,  the  invented process comprises the following steps  in sequence  ;-<br>
(a)	heats  of  primary steel having sulphur content of<br>
0.04% or more by weight are produced  in a BOF having a L.D.<br>
converter of 60 tonne capacity,  lined with basic refractories,<br>
by blowing oxygen of 99.50% purity into the converter for<br>
oxidising the impurities like silicon,  phosphorus,  manganese<br>
and carbon present in the molten steel therein and reducing<br>
their content in the molten steel by double deslagging;<br>
(b)	the molten steel is tapped  into  a pre-heated ladle  in<br>
which ferro-alloys such as low carbon ferro-manganese<br>
[Fe - Mn   (Low C)], high carbon ferro-manganese<br>
[Fe - Mn   (Low C)],  ferro-silicon  (Fe-Si), ferro-chromium<br>
(Fe-Cr),  ferro-vahadium  (Fe-V),  silicon-manganese   (Si-Mn)  and<br>
alloying metals  such as Nickel   (Ni),  copper  (Cu)  and  aluminium<br><br>
(Al) are added in quantities  such as,to the extent of 4 to 5%   by weight  required for producing steel of<br>
chemical  composition   (by weight %)i  C-0.08 to  0.15,  Mn-0.80 to  1.25,  S-0.03 max,  P-0.03 max.,  Si-0.32 to  0.60, Cr-0.42 to 0.65,  Ni-0.20 to 0.30,  Cu-0,25 to 0.40,  V-0.02 to 0,06  and  Fe-the balance,   the said  additions  of ferro-alloys and  alloying metals being made during filling of the ladle with molten steel from one-third to two-third  of the height  of the ladle;<br>
(c)	the molten steel in ladle is transferred to a<br>
secondary refining furnace in which Argon gas rinsing  of the<br>
_    4     -<br><br>
steel is carried out by blowing Argon through a porus plug to homogenise the composition and temperature of the steel in the furnace;<br>
(d)	the refined molten steel is cast into ingots in a<br>
mould of 12.5 tonne capacity, the top part of the mould being<br>
Kept hot for reducing pipe formation during solidification of<br>
the ingots, with addition of known misch metal at a preferred rate<br>
of 1.5 kg per tonne of the steel produced in the mould during<br>
teeming of the molten steel into the mould; casting of ingots<br>
instead of continuous casting (CC) of slabs has been adopted<br>
to make the process more flexible for using heats of primary<br>
steel containing relatively high sulphur inclusion and more<br>
versatile for adoption in steel plants having no facility for<br>
continuous casting;<br>
(e)	hot ingots are charged into soaking pits which are<br>
lined with ceramic fibre and of recuperative type, provided<br>
with side burners using either mixed gases from blast furnaces<br>
and coke ovens or coke oven gases alone, of calorific value<br>
400 K cal/NM3, for heating the charge, and soaked for 6 to 8<br>
hours at a preferred temperature of 1320 C;<br>
(f)	the soaked ingots are hot rolled into slabs of<br>
preferred size 15O/16Omm x 1490mm in a slabbing<br>
mill provided with two rolls each of diameter 1200mm and two manipulators disposed one on each side of the mill for positioning of the slabs on their stand;<br>
(g)	the slabs are hot sheared to remove the pipes and<br>
other defects formed therein and cooled in stocks for preventing<br>
cracks being formed therein;<br>
-5-<br><br>
(h) the cooled slabs are inspected for the presence of defects therein and subjected to scarfing ;<br>
(i) the scarfed slabs are charged into a reheating furnace maintained at a preferred temperature of 1280°C and having an atmosphere containing O.5% oxygen by volume for reducing the formation of sticky scale for preventing rolled-in scale in the finished product;<br>
(j) the reheated slabs are hot rolled into strips and coils of size 5 to 10mm x 1510mm in a hot strip mill provided with lamilar water cooling arrangement maintaining the finishing temperature preferably at 870 + 10°C and the coiling temperature preferably at 640 + 1O°C during rolling for producing relatively fine grain steel of increased yield and ultimate strength with enhanced weldability;<br>
(k) the coils are allowed to cool to the ambient temperature in natural air.<br>
The properties of the steel plates produced are tested. The test results along with the specified minimum values are presented in Table I from which it is noted that the yield strength, ultimate tensile strength and elongation % at break of the product are each appreciably higher than the corresponding minimum specified values.<br>
Extensive shearing, bending and welding operations performed on the steel produced in the invented process in a plant for manufacturing 'Louver Dampers' and like articles have proved the satisfactory end use performance of the product. The corrosion resistance of the steel plates has been found to be 4 to 5 times higher than that of the carbon structural steel*<br>
