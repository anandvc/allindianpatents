				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a therapeutic herbal composition effective against tumour<br>
and process for preparing the same. More particularly this invention pertains to a therapeutic<br>
composition effective against various forms of tumour which is based on indigenously growing<br>
herbs selected mainly from the family of Loranthaceae and shows no adverse physiological effects<br>
even on prolonged administration.<br>
Treatment of tumour in conventional way is usually preceded by invasive diagnostic<br>
procedures like 'biopsy' or 'F.N.A.C, particularly to determine whether such tumour is benign or<br>
malignant in nature. In the latter instance, three different modes of treatment may be adopted,<br>
namely, (i) surgically removing the growth, i.e. performing an operation to remove the growth, (ii)<br>
radiation therapy and (iii) chemotherapy. Operative procedures may provide relief for a limited<br>
period of time, but cannot predict or prevent secondary metastasis, which once sets in can offer<br>
very limited choice of treatment. Radiations applied to the growth area can destroy the abnormal<br>
tissues and reduce pain substantially at the initial stages, but destruction of healthy cells or tissues<br>
in the vicinity of the affected part can hardly be prevented which often results in lowering of<br>
immunity level as determined by the analysing the CD4:CD8 ratio of a patient. As to chemotherapy,<br>
selection of a proper drug plays an important role; but adverse side effects like nausea, loss of<br>
appetite, loss of hair, lowering of immunity level, etc. are often manifested in patients undergoing<br>
such treatment. Even new generation drugs like "Taxol-Carboplatin" are not free from such side<br>
effects.<br>
Advent of new mode of treatments like 'bone marrow transplantation', 'stem cell therapy'<br>
and 'gene therapy' show considerable promise, but average persons can ill afford such expensive<br>
mode of treatment. Moreover, facilities in India are yet to come up with proper infrastructure to<br>
extend such mode of treatment to people afflicted with tumour diagnosed to be malignant.<br>
In a large country like India where nearly seventy percent people live in rural areas, some of<br>
which are far flung and accessible with difficulty, it is important to provide health care and<br>
medication which will be easily available and cost-effective. Even symptomatic and/or manifested<br>
conditions should enable the patient and health-care personnel to initiate medication without having<br>
to wait for expensive diagnostic procedure with consequent loss of valuable time, thereby allowing<br>
unabated process of malignancy.<br>
The primary aim of this invention is to evolve a therapeutic composition prepared from<br>
indigenously growing herbs which is capable of curing tumour without having any adverse side<br>
effects, even or prolonged administration.<br>
A further object of this invention provides a therapeutic composition effective against<br>
various types of tumour prepared from herbs which shows considerable storage stability without<br>
having to use any separate chemical stabilizer.<br>
A still further object of this invention is to provide a therapeutic herbal composition which<br>
shows curative effect on various types of tumour and is extremely cost-effective, being within the<br>
means of even economically backward people.<br>
Another object of this invention is to provide a process for preparing a therapeutic herbal<br>
composition effective against tumour from indigenously available raw materials and vegetative<br>
sources using simple equipments.<br>
Yet another object of this invention is to provide a process for preparing a therapeutic<br>
composition which can be made in bulk and sent to far-off places for treating patients suffering<br>
from tumour.<br>
The foregoing objects are achieved by the present invention which relates to a therapeutic<br>
herbal composition effective against tumour, comprising components in proportions shown<br>
thereagainst:<br>
(i) Macrosolen cochinhinensis Lour van Tiegh - 50%-91% by wt.<br>
(ii) Dendropthoe falcate (L.F.) Danser - 6% by wt. and<br>
(iii) Loranthus pulverulentus Wall - 3%-44%by wt.<br>
Depending on the availability of the herbs of the genus Loranthus, the above composition<br>
may be modified by including the following members in amounts shown—<br>
1. Macrosolen cochinhinensis Lour van Tiegh - 68%by wt.<br>
2. Dendropthoe falcate (L.F.) Danser - 6%by wt.<br>
3. Loranthus Ampullaceous Roxb. - 19%by wt.<br>
4. Loranthus pulverulentus Wall - 5% by wt. and<br>
5. Loranthus Wallichianus Schultz - 2%by wt.<br>
The above herbal composition may be further modified as shown below: -<br>
(a) Macrosolen cochinhinensis Lour van Tiegh - 91%by wt<br>
(b) Dendropthoe falcate (L.F.) Danser - 6% by wt. and<br>
(c) Loranthus pulverulentus Wall - 3%by wt.<br>
It is to be noted that the quality, namely, the content of the active ingredient(s), of the<br>
members belonging to the genus "Loranthus" of the family "Loranthaceae" and "Macrosolen" may<br>
be varied within around ±5% with the variation in the weather/climatic conditions as well as<br>
seasonal changes.<br>
All the herbs mentioned above show none-too-pronounced anti-tumour effect individually,<br>
but an admixture in the proportion shown above exhibit a surprisingly enhanced effect in<br>
combating tumour with no adverse side effects or contraindication. Leaves, tubers, stems and roots<br>
of the herbs aforementioned all are more or less active against tumour, the roots being most potent.<br>
In this invention the composition has been formulated by using the roots and tubers of the herbs in<br>
amounts shown above.<br>
The invention also provides a process for preparing a therapeutic herbal composition<br>
effective against tumour as defined above, which comprises—<br>
(a) collecting roots and tubers of the aforementioned herbs and thoroughly cleaning them<br>
by washing with water, followed by drying in air;<br>
(b) grinding the dried roots to a fine powdery form in a grinder and mixing the components<br>
in amounts aforesaid;<br>
(c) boiling the mixture in a pressure vessel at a temperature between 130° and 140°C after<br>
adding requisite quantity of water to submerge the ingredients for a period of around 15<br>
minutes;<br>
(d) the mixture from step (c) is cooled to ambient temperature, mixed with approximately<br>
double the volume of aqueous ethanol (91% v/v) and heated to a temperature of around<br>
80°C for 10-15 minutes;<br>
(e) cooling the mass to room temperature, filtering the alcoholic extract through a filter<br>
paper and discarding the residues and<br>
(f) pouring the filtrate in sterilized glass bottles, preferably with ground glass stoppers and<br>
closing the mouth with aluminium foil or other suitable wrapping material.<br>
Alcohol used in the above process is absolute ethanol and simple household equipments like<br>
mixer-cum-grinder and pressure cooker may be used in preparing the above composition.<br>
The invention will now be more particularly described with the help of the following<br>
examples which are given by way of illustration and not by way of limitation.<br>
Example -1<br>
100 gms of dried roots and/or tubers of the herbs are cleaned by washing with water to free<br>
them from adhering dirt, grime and/or insects. The cleaned dried mass is reduced to powdery form<br>
with the help of a grinder and the powder is heated in a pressure vessel such as a pressure cooker at<br>
a temperature between 130° and 190°C in 0.9-1 litre of distilled water or clear notable surface<br>
water. The heating is continued for around 15 minutes.<br>
The mass after heating in a pressure vessel is cooled to ambient temperature to which is<br>
added around 2.5 litres of 91% ethanol. The mixture is heated for 10-15 minutes at a temperature<br>
between 70° and 85°C. After heating the mass is cooled to room temperature, filtered with the help<br>
of "Whatman" filter paper and the filtrate is stored in sterilized bottles after providing the bottles<br>
with plastic coated stoppers, preferably ground glass stoppers. The mouth of the bottles may be<br>
further secured by wrapping with aluminium foil, plastic sheet or the like impervious material and<br>
the bottles are preferably stored in cold, e.g. in refrigerators.<br>
Treatment mode and dosage:<br>
(i) For treating painless tumours:<br>
1 drop of the alcoholic extract filtrate is to be taken in the morning empty stomach<br>
after diluting it with 25 ml of drinking water. Such administration is to be continued with<br>
no discontinuity for a period varying between 6 and 18 months till total disappearance of<br>
the tumour growth. Irregularity in the intake of medicine is likely to necessitate longer<br>
administration of medicine.<br>
(ii) For treating painful tumours:<br>
1 drop of filtrate is added to 30 ml of water which is divided into two halves of<br>
around 15 ml each. One half is to be taken in the morning empty stomach, and the other<br>
half is to be taken after 12 hours in an empty stomach. Preferably nothing should be taken<br>
at least half an hour before and after intake of medicine. Administration of medicine is to<br>
be continued till (a) disappearance of pain in the first instance and (b) disappearance of<br>
growth with return of normal functioning of organs.<br>
(iii) For treating chronic sores:<br>
To cure old or/and chronic wounds or sores, 1-2 drops of filtrate is to be mixed<br>
with 25 ml of clear, potable water and taken in the morning empty stomach. If taken on a<br>
regular basis, wounds or sores, however persistent or deep-rooted they may be, are likely<br>
to be cured within a period of 6-12 months, depending on the nature and complexity of<br>
infection.<br>
However, it must be borne in mind that regular administration by following the<br>
prescribed mode is likely to bring about rapid cure with no adverse side effects or<br>
contraindications.<br>
Example 2<br>
(A) Roots of the abovementioned plants, trivially known as "Boramanda" / "Vangara"<br>
and "Bandha", are collected and cleaned of the adhering soil and dirt by thoroughly washing<br>
with water. The washed roots are dried and ground in a grinder to a fine powdery form. The<br>
powdered roots of individual herbs are mixed in proportion as noted earlier.<br>
100 gms. of the root mixture is soaked in 3.6 litres of aqueous alcohol (91% v/v)<br>
and heated in a pressure cooker at around 75°-80°C (~170°F) for a period of around 15 minutes.<br>
The cooker with its contents is allowed to cool and then filtered. The filtrate is collected in<br>
sterilized glass containers / bottles which are then stoppered.<br>
(B) Dosage : Every morning one drop of the filtrate is to be taken in 25 ml. of water in<br>
empty stomach for adults. Depending on the duration and extent of<br>
tumour growth, the intake of the herbal composition may be continued for<br>
a period extending from 6 months to 1.5 years, till the disappearance of<br>
tumour.<br>
For children upto ten years, the dosage is to be halved.<br>
(C) Recommended diet restriction - In the course of treatment it is better to restrict intake<br>
of the following items of food, particularly in the first few months of treatment:<br>
red meat, egg, excessive sour items, leafy vegetables, dioscorea, jackfruits,<br>
bananas (both green and ripe), partially boiled rice and food items prepared from such partially<br>
cooked material, drumsticks (sajna) and edible roots like Amorthothallus.<br>
The diet restriction need not be adhered to once the tumour is cured.<br>
Advantages :<br>
1. The herbal composition is capable of alleviating excruciating pain associated with<br>
tumour, and it also brings down the temperature within normal limits.<br>
2. The composition slowly erodes the tumour and removes the growth completely, as<br>
has been evidenced by ultrasonography after 6 months' continuous intake of<br>
medicine.<br>
3. The herbal components of the composition are extremely rich in anti-oxidant content,<br>
which raises the immunity level of patients having tumour.<br>
4. The herbal composition is capable of arresting tumour growth by preventing<br>
abnormal cell division and also prevents haemorrhage by killing wound-inducing<br>
cells or by curing rupture of skin/lesions.<br>
5. The herbal composition of this invention has a prolonged shelf life extending over a<br>
year without the need of an external stabilizer.<br>
6. The composition is totally safe, has no adverse side effects and shows no<br>
contraindication on withdrawal even after a prolonged administration.<br>
7. The herbal composition is extremely cost-effective, being prepared by simple<br>
procedure using raw materials from indigenous vegetative sources.<br>
While the invention has been described in detail and with reference to specific<br>
embodiments thereof, it will be apparent to one skilled in the art that various changes and<br>
modifications can be made therein without deviating or departing from the spirit and scope of the<br>
invention. Thus the disclosure contained herein includes within its ambit the obvious equivalents<br>
and substitutes as well.<br>
