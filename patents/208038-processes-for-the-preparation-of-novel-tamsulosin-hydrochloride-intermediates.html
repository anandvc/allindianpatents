namely	phenyl     substituted    2-methoxy-5-[(2R)-[(l-E/Z-pheylmethylene)amino]propyl]<br>
benzenesulfonamide of formula-Ill,<br><br>

(v) converting the Tamsulosin base of the formula-XVIII     into Tamsulosin hydrochloride of formula-I as defined above by conventional methods.<br><br>
The scheme of reaction is shown in Scheme I below<br><br>
The monoalkylation of the primary amine of formula-IV is carried out by the method of Decker &amp; Becker [Decker &amp; Becker, Ann, 395, 328 (1913)]. So far this method has not been used earlier for making Tamsulosin hydrochloride of formula-I.<br>
The above process has been made the subject matter of our co pending application no. 599/MAS/2002, which claimed a process for the preparation of Tamsulosin hydrochloride.<br>
The present invention also relates to novel intermediates of the above mentioned formula-II which are as explained above, are useful for the preparation of Tamsulosin hydrochloride.<br><br>
Prior Art:<br>
Tamsulosin hydrochloride is first disclosed in JP 55-14382 dt. 8-2-1980 and its equivalent US 4731,478 dt. 15/3/1988, wherein the intermediate R(-)-5-[(2~amino-2-methyl)ethyl]-2-methoxybenzenesulfonamide of formula-IV is refluxed for 16hrs with another intermediate 2-(2-ethoxyphenoxy) ethylbromide of Formula-V in ethanol medium to obtain crude Tamsulosin base, which is purified by column chromatography to get pure base. The pure Tamsulosin base is treated with HC1 in ethanol to obtain Tamsulosin hydrochloride of formula-I in 36.8% of yield based on the expensive intermediate of formula-IV. The synthetic route is given below in<br><br>
further the reaction time required is very long (i.e) more than 16hrs resulting in poor yields. The expensive intermediate R(-)-5-[(2-amino-2-methyl)ethyl-2-methoxybenzenesulfonamide of formula-IV is required in 2 mole equivalents to the other intermediate 2-(2-ethoxyphenoxy) ethylbromide of formula-V as the compound of formula-IV is reacted to form salt with the liberated HBr formed during the coupling reaction.<br><br>
It is also disclosed in JP 254326 and its Austrian equivalent patent AT 397960 B that R(-) 5-[(2-amino-2-methyl)ethyl]-2-methoxybenzenesulfonamide of formula-IV is reacted with 2-(2-ethoxyphenoxy)acetaldehyde of formula-X, which is generated insitu by acid treatment of 2-(2-ethoxyphenoxy)acetaldehyde dimethyl acetal of formula-VII to get an imine compound of formula-VIII. Then the imine compound of formula-VIII is reduced with either platinum oxide or sodium borohydride / sodium cyano borohydride and on further treatment with HC1 to obtain Tamsulosin hydrochloride of formula-I. The process for making compound of formula-VII is also disclosed. Guaiethol is reacted with bromo acetaidehyde diethylacetal of formula-IX using sodium hydride as base and dimethyl formamide as solvent. The reaction sequence is shown in<br><br>
The main drawbacks in this process are:<br>
1. For the preparation of intermediates 2-(2-ethoxyphenoxy) acetaidehyde of formula-X, more steps are involved and pyrophoric reagents like sodium hydride has to be used for synthesis of the compound of formula-X.<br><br>
2.	For the reduction of imine of formula-VIII expensive and pyrophoric hydrogenation<br>
catalyst platinum oxide has to be used and special hydrogenation equipment is necessary to<br>
carry out the catalytic hydrogenation.<br>
3.	For the reduction of imine of formula-VIII expensive reagent sodium borohydride / sodium<br>
cyano borohydride is necessary.<br>
JP 02306958 (1988-Hokuriku) discloses an alternate process for making Tamsulosin hydrochloride of formula-I. (2R)-4-Methoxyphenylisopropylamine of formula-XI is reacted with 2-bromoacetic acid of formula-XII using pivaloyl chloride and triethylamine to obtain N-2-(bromoacetoxy)-2(R)-4-methoxyphenylisopropylamine of formula-XIII. The compound of formula-XIII is reacted with chlorosulphonic acid and then with ammonia solution to obtain its sulfonamide derivative of formula-XIV, which is reacted with guaiethol using potassium carbonate as base to obtain an amide derivative of formula-XV. The amide derivative of formula-XV is reduced with lithium aluminium hydride to secondary amine compound, which on treatment with HC1 gives Tamsulosin hydrochloride of formula-I. The synthetic route is outlined in the following scheme-C.<br><br><br>
The main drawbacks in this process are:<br>
1.	More number of steps is involved there-by making the route very cumbersome.<br>
2.	Highly pyrophoric and expensive reagent lithium aluminium hydride is used to carry out the reduction of amide to secondary amine.<br>
Recognizing the importance of Tamsulosin hydrochloride of the formula-I as a widely used drug for the treatment of benign prostate hyperplasia, and taking into account the difficulties of the hitherto known processes for its preparation, we under took research to develop a simple, cheap and commercially viable process for producing Tamsulosin hydrochloride, starting with (R)-5-(2-aminopropyl)-2-methoxybenzenesulfonamide of formula-IV. While developing the improved process we could identify two novel compounds namely the compounds, namely, N-(phenyl substituted)-[2-(2-ethoxyphenoxy)ethyl]-[2-(4-methoxy-3-sulphamoylphenyl)-l(R)-methyl-ethyl]ammonium halides having the formula-II as defined above and compounds having the formula-Ill. <br>
where R represents H, 4-OCH3, 4-OH or 4-fluoro and X represents CI, Br or I.<br>
The main objective of the present invention, therefore, is to provide novel intermediate namely, N-(phenyl substituted)-[2-(2-ethoxyphenoxy)ethyl]-[2-(4-methoxy-3-sulphamoylphenyl)-l(R)-methyl-ethyl]ammonium halides having the formula-II as defined above which are useful for the preparation of Tamsulosin hydrochloride of the formula-I,<br>
Another objective of the present invention is to provide a process for the preparation of the novel intermedaites namely, N-(phenyl substituted)-[2-(2-ethoxyphenoxy)ethyl]-[2-(4-methoxy-3-sulphamoylphenyl)-l(R)-methyl-ethyl]ammonium halides having of the formula II as defined above.<br><br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a process for the preparation of novel quarternary ammonium salts, namely, N-(substituted phenyl)methylene-N-2-(2-ethoxyphenoxy)ethyl-N-(5-(2-methoxy-l-sulphamoyl)phenyl-(2R)-propylamonium halides of formula-II, as defined above which are key intermediate for the preparation of Tamsulosin hydrochloride of formula-I, which comprises:<br>
(i) reacting the compound of formula-IV with a substituted aromatic benzaldehyde of the formula-XVI, <br>
where R represents the group such as H, 4-OCH3, 4-OH or 4-fluoro groups to obtain a novel compounds, namely, phenyl substituted 2-methoxy-5-{(2R)-[lE/Z-phenylmethylene) amino]propyl]benzene sulfonamide of formula-Ill,<br><br>
where R represents group such as H, 4-OCH3,4-OH or 4-fluoro.<br>
(ii) reacting te novel compound of the formula-Ill with 2-(2-ethoxyphenoxy)ethyl halide of formula-XVII, <br>
where the halo group is CI, Br or I, at a temp in the range of 80° to 130°C to obtain the novel quarternary ammonium salts, namely, N-(phenyl substituted)-[2-(2-ethoxy- phenoxy)ethyl]-[2-<br><br>
(4-methoxy-3-sulphamoylphenyl)-l(R)-methyl-ethyl]ammonium halides of the formula-II, as defined above.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the present invention the step (i) may be effected by azeotropically removing the water using a solvent such as toluene, xylene etc. or by simultaneous distillation of the water formed using an alcoholic solvent such as methanol, ethanol, isopropyl alcohol, n-butanol etc. The reaction of step (ii) may be performed either neatly or by using solvent such as toluene, xylene, n-butanol, dimethyl formamide, dimethyl acetamide etc. The compound of formula-II is isolated by filtration or by removal of the solvent and by simple leaching with a suitable solvent such as methylene chloride etc., to remove the unreacted alkylhalide.<br>
In our co pending application no. 597/MAS/2002 we have described and claimed the novel intermediate of the formula III. Similarly in our co pending application no. 599/MAS/2002 we have described an claimed a process for the preparation of Tamsulosin hydrochloride using the novel intermediates of the formulae II &amp; III.<br>
