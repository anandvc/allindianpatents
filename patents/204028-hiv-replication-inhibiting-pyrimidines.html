It will be appreciated that some of the compounds of formula (I) or (I-a) and their N-oxides, addition salts, quaternary amines and stereochemically isomeric forms may contain one or more centers of chirality and exist as stereochemically isomeric forms.<br>
The term "stereochemically isomeric forms" as used hereinbefore defines all the possible stereoisomeric forms which the compounds of formula (I) or (I-a), and their N~ oxides, addition salts, quaternary amines or physiologically functional derivatives may possess. Unless otherwise mentioned or indicated, the chemical designation of compounds denotes the mixture of all possible stereochemically isomeric forms, said mixtures containing all diastereomers and enantiomers of the basic molecular structure as well as each of the individual isomeric forms of formula (I) or (I-a) and their TV-oxides, salts, solvates or quaternary amines substantially free, i.e. associated with less than 10%, preferably less than 5%, in particular less than 2% and most preferably less than 1% of the other isomers. In particular, stereogenic centers may have the R- or S-configuration; substituents on bivalent cyclic (partially) saturated radicals may have either the cis- or tranj-configuration. Compounds encompassing double bonds can have an E or Z-stereochemistry at said double bond. Stereochemically isomeric forms of the compounds of formula (I) or (I-a) are obviously intended to be embraced within the scope of this invention.<br>
For therapeutic use, salts of the compounds of formula (I) or (I-a) are those wherein the counterion is pharmaceutically acceptable. However, salts of acids and bases which are not pharmaceutically acceptable may also find use, for example, in the preparation or purification of a pharmaceutically acceptable compound. Ail salts, whether pharmaceu¬tically acceptable or not are included within the ambit of the present invention.<br>
The pharmaceutically acceptable acid and base addition salts as mentioned hereinabove are meant to comprise the therapeutically active nontoxic acid and base addition salt<br><br>
WO 00/27825<br>
forms which the compounds of formula (I) or (I-a) are able to form. The pharmaceutical])/ acceptable acid addition salts can conveniently be obtained by treating the base form with such appropriate acid. Appropriate acids comprise, for example, inorganic acids such as hydrohalic acids, e.g. hydrochloric or hydrobromic acid, sulfuric, nitric, phosphoric and the like acids; or organic acids such as, for example, acetic, propanoic, hydroxyaceuc, lactic, pyruvic, oxalic (i.e. ethanedioic), malonic, succinic (i.e. butanedioic acid), maleic, fumaric, malic, tartaric, citric, methanesulfonic, ethanesulfonic, benzenesulfonic, p-toluenesulfonic, cyclamic, salicylic, p-aminosalicylic, pamoic and the like acids.<br>

The compounds of formula (1) or (I-a) containing an acidic proton may also be converted into their non-toxic metal or amine addition salt forms by treatment with appropnate organic and inorganic bases. Appropriate base salt forms comprise, for example, the ammonium salts, the alkali and earth alkaline metal salts, e.g. the lithium, sodium, potassium, magnesium, calcium salts and the like, salts with organic bases, e.g. the benzathine, N-methyl-D-glucamine, hydrabamine salts, and salts with amino acids<br>
-	such as, for example, arginine, lysine and the like.<br>
The term addition salt as used hereinabove also comprises the solvates which the compounds of formula (I) or (I-a) as well as the salts thereof, are able to form. Such solvates are for example hydrates, alcoholates and the like.<br>
Some of the compounds of formula (I) or (I-a) may also exist in their tautomeric form. Such forms although not explicitly indicated in the above formula are intended to be included within the scope of the present invention.<br>
Whenever used hereinafter, the term "compounds of formula (I)" or "compounds of formula (I-a)" is meant to include also the N-oxides, the pharmaceutical^ acceptable acid addition salts, quaternary amines and all stereoisomers forms.<br>

Suitable solvents are, for example, water, lower alcohols, e.g. ethanol and the like, hydrocarbons, e.g. toluene, ketones, e.g. 2-butanone, halogenated hydrocarbons, e.g. dichloromethane, and mixtures of such solvents.<br>
For instance, the compounds of formula.(I-a) wherein Q is a halogen may be converted to the corresponding compounds wherein Q is -NR4H using NH2R4 as a reagent in a reaction inert solvent such as, for example, 1,4-dioxane and the like, optionally in the presence of a suitable base such as, for example, triethylamine or N,N-diisopropylethyI-amineor the like. In case R4 contains a hydroxy moiety, it may be convenient to perform the above reaction with a protected form of NH2R whereby the hydroxy moiety bears a suitable protecting group P being, for instance, a trialkylsilyl group, and subsequently removing the protective group according to art-known methodologies.<br>
Some of the compounds of formula (I-a) and some of the intermediates in the present invention may contain an asymmetric carbon atom. Pure stereochemically isomeric forms of said compounds and said intermediates can be obtained by the application of art-known procedures. For example, diastereoisomers can be separated by physical methods such as selective crystallization or chromatographic techniques, e.g. counter current distribution, liquid chromatography and the like methods. Enantiomers can be obtained from racemic mixtures by first converting said racemic mixtures with suitable resolving agents such as, for example, chiral acids, to mixtures of diastereomeric salts or compounds; then physically separating said mixtures of diastereomeric salts or compounds by, for example, selective crystallization or chromatographic techniques, e.g. liquid chromatography and the like methods; and finally converting said separated diastereomeric salts or compounds into the corresponding enantiomers. Pure stereochemically isomeric forms may also be obtained from the pure stereochemically isomeric forms of the appropriate intermediates and starting materials, provided that the intervening reactions occur stereospecifically.<br>
An alternative manner of separating the enantiomeric forms of the compounds of formula (I-a) and intermediates involves liquid chromatography, in particular liquid chromatography using a chiral stationary phase.<br>
Some of the intermediates and starting materials are known compounds and may be<br><br>

Different regio-specific isomers may be formed and can be separated from one another using suitable <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
separation techniques such as, for example, chromatography.<br>
Intermediates of formula (IV) can be prepared by reacting an intermediate of formula (VD-a) wherein W2 is a suitable leaving group such as, for example, a halogen, with an intermediate of formula (IX) in a suitable solvent such as, for example, 1 -methyI-2-pyrrolidinone, 1,4-dioxane or the like, in the presence of an acid such as, for example, 1 N hydrochloric acid in diethyl ether. This reaction can be performed at a temperature ranging between 50 °C and 250 °C.<br><br>

WO 00/27825<br>
Intermediates of formula (X) can be prepared by reacting an intermediate of formula (XI) or a functional derivative thereof, with an intermediate of formula (IX). This reaction may be performed under solvent-free conditions or in an appropriate solvent such as, for example, diglyme, tetraline or the like under a reaction-inert atmosphere such as, for example, oxygen free argon or nitrogen, and optionally in the presence of a base such as, for example, sodium hydride, potassium hydride or the like. This reaction can be performed at a temperature ranging between 100 °C and 250 °C.<br><br>
Intermediates of formula (X) can also be prepared by reacting an intermediate of formula (XII), wherein W2 is a suitable leaving group and Y and Q are as defined for a compound of formula (I-a), with an intermediate of formula (XIII) in an appropriate solvent such as , for example, ethanol, or the like, and in the presence of a base such as, for example, sodium ethoxide or the like, under a reaction-inert atmosphere such as, for example, oxygen free argon or nitrogen. The reaction can be performed at a temperature ranging between 20 °C and 125 °C.<br><br>
A convenient way of preparing an intermediate of formula (IV) wherein Y is a bromine or chloro atom, said intermediates being represented by formula (IV-1), involves the introduction of a bromine or chloro atom to an intermediate of formula (XIV), wherein W  is as previously defined, using N-bromosuccinimide or N-chlorosuccinimide in a reaction-inert solvent such as, for example, chloroform, carbon tetrachloride or the like. This reaction can be performed at a temperature ranging between 20 °C and 125 °C.<br><br>
WO 00/27825<br><br>
Analogous to the conversion of compounds of formula (I-a) wherein Q is a halogen to compounds of formula (I-a) wherein Q is -NHR4, the intermediates of formula (II), (IV) and (VII) can also be converted.<br>
The compounds of formula (I-a) as prepared in the hereinabove described processes may be synthesized as a mixture of stereoisomeric forms, in particular in the form of racemic mixtures of enantiomers which can be separated from one another following art-known resolution procedures. The racemic compounds of formula (I-a) may be converted into the corresponding diastereomeric salt forms by reaction with a suitable chiral acid. Said diastereomeric salt forms are subsequently separated, for example, by selective or fractional crystallization and the enantiomers are liberated therefrom by alkali. An alternative manner of separating the enantiomeric forms of the compounds of formula (I-a) involves liquid chromatography using a chiral stationary phase. Said pure stereochemically isomeric forms may also be derived from the corresponding pure stereochemically isomeric forms of the appropriate starting materials, provided that the reaction occurs stereospecifically. Preferably if a specific stereoisomer is desired, said compound will be synthesized by stereospecific methods of preparation. These methods will advantageously employ enantiomerically pure starting materials.<br>
It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that in the processes described above the functional groups of intermediate compounds may need to be blocked by protecting groups.<br>
Functional groups which it is desirable to protect include hydroxy, amino and carboxylic acid. Suitable protecting groups for hydroxy include trialkylsilyl groups (e.g. ferr-butyldimeihylsilyl, tert-butyldiphenylsilyl or trimethylsilyl), benzyl and tetrahydropyranyl. Suitable protecting groups for amino include rerr-butyloxycarbonyl or benzyloxycarbonyl. Suitable protecting groups for carboxylic acid include C1-6alkyl or benzyl esters.<br><br>
WO 00/27825<br>
The protection and deprotection of functional groups may take place before or after a reaction step.<br>
The use of protecting groups is fully described in "Protective Groups in Organic Chemistry", edited by J W F McOmie, Plenum Press (1973), and "Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis" 2nd edition, TW Greene &amp; P G M Wutz, Wiley Interscience (1991).<br>
The compounds of formula (I) and (I-a) show antiretroviral properties, in particular against Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), which is the aetiological agent of -Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) in humans. The HIV virus preferentially infects human T-4 cells and destroys them or changes their normal function, particularly the coordination of the immune system. As a result, an infected patient has an everdecreasing number of T-4 cells, which moreover behave abnormally. Hence, the immunological defense system is unable to combat infections and neoplasms and the HIV infected subject usually dies by opportunistic infections such as pneumonia, or by cancers. Other conditions associated with HTV infection include thrombocytopaenia, Kaposi"s sarcoma and infection of the central nervous system characterized by progressive demyelination, resulting in dementia and symptoms such as, progressive dysarthria, ataxia and disorientation. HTV infection further has also been associated with peripheral neuropathy, progressive generalized lymphadenopathy (PGL) and AIDS-related complex (ARC).<br>
The present compounds also show activity against HIV-I strains that have acquired resistance to art-known non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. They also have little or no binding affinity to human a-i acid glycoprotein.<br>
Due to their antiretroviral properties, particularly their anti-HIV properties, especially their anti-HIV-l-activity, the compounds of formula (1) or (I-a), their N-oxides, pharmaceutically acceptable addition salts, quaternary amines and stereochemically isomeric forms thereof, are useful in the treatment of individuals infected by HTV and for the prophylaxis of these infections. In general, the compounds of the present invention may be useful in the treatment of warm-blooded animals infected with viruses whose existence is mediated by, or depends upon, the enzyme reverse transcriptase. Conditions which maybe prevented or treated with the compounds of the present invention, especially conditions associated with HTV and other pathogenic retroviruses, include AIDS, AIDS-related complex (ARC), progressive generalized lymphadenopathy (PGL), as well as chronic CNS diseases caused by retroviruses, such as, for example HTV mediated dementia and multiple sclerosis.<br><br>
WO 00/27825<br>
The compounds of the present invention or any subgroup thereof may therefore be used as medicines against above-mentioned conditions   Said use as a medicine or method of treatment comprises the systemic administration to HIV-infected subjects of an amount effective to combat the conditions associated with HIV and other pathogenic retroviruses, especially HIV-1.<br>
The compounds of the present invention or any subgroup thereof may be formulated into various pharmaceutical forms for administration purposes. As appropriate compositions there may be cited all compositions usually employed for systemically administering drugs. To prepare the pharmaceutical compositions of this invention, an effective amount of the particular compound, optionally in addition salt form, as the active ingredient is combined in intimate admixture with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, which carrier may take a wide variety of forms depending on the form of preparation desired for administration. These pharmaceutical compositions are desirable in unitary dosage form suitable, particularly, for administration orally, rectally, percutaneously, or by parenteral injection. For example, in preparing the compositions in oral dosage form, any of the usual pharmaceutical media may be employed such as, for example, water, glycols, oils, alcohols and the like in the case of oral liquid preparations such as suspensions, syrups, elixirs, emulsions and solutions; or solid carriers such as starches, sugars, kaolin, diluents, lubricants, binders, disintegrating agents and the like in the case of powders, pills, capsules, and tablets. Because of their ease in administration, tablets and capsules represent the most advantageous oral dosage unit forms, in which case solid pharmaceutical carriers are obviously employed For parenteral compositions, the carrier will usually comprise sterile water, at least in large part, though other ingredients, for example, to aid solubility, may be included. Injectable solutions, for example, may be prepared in which the carrier comprises saline solution, glucose solution or a mixture of saline and glucose solution. Injectable suspensions may also be prepared in which case appropriate liquid carriers, suspending agents and the like may be employed. Also included are solid form preparations which are intended to be converted, shortly before use, to liquid form preparations. In the compositions suitable for percutaneous administration, the carrier optionally comprises a penetration enhancing agent and/or a suitable wetting agent, optionally combined with suitable additives of any nature in minor proportions, which additives do not introduce a significant deletenous effect on the skin. Said additives may facilitate the administration to the skin and/or may be<br><br>
WO 00/27825<br>
helpful for preparing the desired compositions. These compositions may be administered in various ways, e.g., as a transdermal patch, as a spot-on, as an ointment.<br><br>
The term mixed ether denotes cyclodextrin derivatives wherein at least two cyclodextrin hydroxy groups are etherified with different groups such as, for example, hydroxy-propyl and hydroxyethyl.<br>
The average molar substitution (M.S.) is used as a measure of the average number of moles of alkoxy units per mole of anhydroglucose. The average substitution degree (D.S.) refers to the average number of substituted hydroxyls per anhydroglucose unit. The M.S. and D.S. value can be determined by various analytical techniques such as nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), mass spectrometry (MS) and infrared spectroscopy (ER). Depending on the technique used, slightly different values may be obtained for one given cyclodextrin derivative. Preferably, as measured by mass spectrometry, the M.S. ranges from 0.125 to 10 and the D.S. ranges from 0.125 to 3.<br>
Other suitable compositions for oral or rectal administration comprise particles obtainable by melt-extruding a mixture comprising a compound of formula (I-a) and an appropriate water-soluble polymer and subsequently milling said melt-extruded mixture. Said particles can then be formulated by conventional techniques into pharmaceutical dosage forms such as tablets and capsules.<br>
Said particles consist of a solid dispersion comprising a compound of formula (I-a) and one or more pharmaceutically acceptable water-soluble polymers. The preferred<br><br>
WO 00/27825<br>
technique for preparing solid dispersions is the melt-extrusion process comprises the following steps :<br>
a)	mixing a compound of formula (I-a) and an appropriate water-soluble polymer,<br>
b)	optionally blending additives with the thus obtained mixture,<br>
c)	hearing the thus obtained blend until one obtains a homogenous melt,<br>
d)	forcing the thus obtained melt through one or more nozzles; and<br>
e)	cooling the melt till it solidifies.<br>
The solid dispersion product is milled or ground to particles having a particle size of less than 1500 pm, preferably less than 400 urn, more preferably less than 250 urn and most preferably less than 125 um.<br>
The water-soluble polymers in the particles are polymers that have an apparent viscosity, when dissolved at 20°C in an aqueous solution at 2 % (w/v), of 1 to 5000   mPa.s, more preferably of 1 to 700 mPa.s, and most preferred of 1 to 100 mPa.s. For example, suitable water-soluble polymers include alkylcelluloses, hydroxyalkyl-celluloses, hydroxyalkyl alkylcelluloses, carboxyalkylcelluloses, alkali metal salts of carboxyalkylcelluloses, carboxyalkylalkylcelluloses, carboxyalkylcellulose esters, starches, pectines, chitin derivates, polysaccharides, polyacrylic acids and the salts thereof, polymethacrylic acids and the salts and esters thereof, methacrylate copolymers, polyvinylalcohol, polyalkylene oxides and copolymers of ethylene oxide and propylene oxide. Preferred water-soluble polymers are Eudragit E" (Rohm GmbH, Germany) and hydroxypropyl methylcelluloses.<br>
Also one or more cyclodextrins can be used as water soluble polymer in the preparation of the above-mentioned particles as is disclosed in WO 97/18839. Said cyclodextrins include the pharmaceutically acceptable unsubstituted and substituted cyclodextrins known in the art, more particularly α, β or y cyclodextrins or the pharmaceutically acceptable derivatives thereof.<br>
Substituted cyclodextrins which can be used include polyethers described in U.S. Patent 3,459,731. Further substituted cyclodextrins are ethers wherein the hydrogen of one or more cyclodextnn hydroxy groups is replaced by C1-6alkyl, hydroxyC 1-6alkyl. carboxy-C1-6alkyl or C1-6alkyloxycarbonylC1-6alkyl or mixed ethers thereof. In<br>
particular such substituted cyclodextrins are ethers wherein the hydrogen of one or more cyclodextrin hydroxy groups is replaced by C1-3alkyl, hydroxyC2-4alkyl or carboxyC1-2alkyl or more in particular by methyl, ethyl, hydroxyethyl, hydroxypropyl, hydroxybutyl, carboxy-methyl or carboxyethyl.<br><br>
WO 00/27825<br>
Of particular utility are the p-cyclodextnn ethers, e.g. dimethyl-p-cyclodextrin as described in Drugs of the Future, Vol. 9, No. 8, p. 577-578 by M. Nogradi (1984) and polyethers, e.g. hydroxypropyl β-cyclodextrin and hydroxyethy] β-cyclodextrin, being examples. Such an alkyl ether may be a methyl ether with a degree of substitution of about 0.125 to 3, e.g. about 0.3 to 2. Such a hydroxypropyl cyclodextrin may for example be formed from the reaction between β-cyclodextrin an propylene oxide and may have a MS value of about 0.125 to 10, e.g. about 0.3 to 3.<br>
A more novel type of substituted cyclodextrins is sulfobutylcyclodextrines.<br>
The ratio of the compound of formula (I-a) over cyclodextrin may vary widely. For example ratios of 1/100 to 100/1 may be applied. Interesting ratios of active ingredient over cyclodextrin range from about 1/10 to 10/1. More interesting ratios of active ingredient over cyclodextrin range from about 1/5 to 5/1.<br>
It may further be convenient to formulate the compounds of formula (I-a) in the form of nanoparticles which have a surface modifier adsorbed on the surface thereof in an amount sufficient to maintain an effective average particle size of less than 1000 nm. Useful surface modifiers are believed to include those which physically adhere to the surface of the compound of formula (I-a) but do not chemically bond to said compound.<br>
Suitable surface modifiers can preferably be selected from known organic and inorganic pharmaceutical excipients. Such excipients include various polymers, low molecular weight oligomers, natural products and surfactants. Preferred surface modifiers include nonionic and anionic surfactants.<br>
Yet another interesting way of formulating the compounds of formula (I-a) involves a pharmaceutical composition whereby the compounds of formula (I-a) are incorporated in hydrophilic polymers and applying this mixture as a coat film over many small beads, thus yielding a composition which can conveniently be manufactured and which is suitable for preparing pharmaceutical dosage forms for oral administration.<br>
Said beads comprise a central, rounded or spherical core, a coating film of a hydrophilic polymer and a compound of formula (I-a) and a seal-coating polymer layer.<br>
Materials suitable for use as cores in the beads are manifold, provided that said<br><br>
WO 00/27825<br>
materials are pharmaceutically acceptable and have appropriate dimensions and firmness. Examples of such matenals are polymers, inorganic substances, organic substances, and saccharides and derivatives thereof.<br>
It is especially advantageous to formulate the aforementioned pharmaceutical compositions in unit dosage form for ease of administration and uniformity of dosage. Unit dosage form as used herein refers to physically discrete units suitable as unitary dosages, each unit containing a predetermined quantity of active ingredient calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect in association with the required pharmaceutical carrier. Examples of such unit dosage forms are tablets (including scored or coated tablets), capsules, pills, powder packets, wafers, suppositories, injectable solutions or suspensions and the like, and segregated multiples thereof.<br>
Those of skill in the treatment of HIV-infection could determine the effective daily amount from the test results presented here. In general it is contemplated that an effective daily amount would be from 0.01 mg/kg to 50 mg/kg body weight, more preferably from 0.1 mg/kg to 10 mg/kg body weight. It may be appropriate to administer the required dose as two, three, four or more sub-doses at appropriate intervals throughout the day. Said sub-doses may be formulated as unit dosage forms, for example, containing I to 1000 mg. and in particular 5 to 200 mg of active ingredient per unit dosage form.<br>
The exact dosage and frequency of administration depends on the particular compound of formula (I) or (I-a) used, the particular condition being treated, the severity of the condition being treated, the age, weight and general physical condition of the particular patient as well as other medication the individual may be taking, as is well known to those skilled in the art. Furthermore, it is evident that said effective daily amount may be lowered or increased depending on the response of the treated subject and/or depending on the evaluation of the physician prescnbing the compounds of the instant invention. The effective daily amount ranges mentioned hereinabove are therefore only guidelines and are not intended to limit the scope or use of the invention to any extent.<br>
Also, the combination of an antiretroviral compound and a compound of formula (I) or (I-a) can be used as a medicine. Thus, the present invention also relates to a product containing (a) a compound of formula (I) or (l-a), and (b) another antiretroviral compound, as a combined preparation for simultaneous, separate or sequential use in anti-HIV treatment. The different drugs may be combined in a single preparation together with pharmaceutically acceptable carriers   Said other antiretroviral<br><br>
compounds may be known antiretro viral compounds such as nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, e.g. zidovudine (3"-azido-3"-deoxythymidine, AZT), didanosine (dideoxy inosine; ddl), zalcitabine (dideoxycytidine, ddC) or lamivudine (3"-thia-2"-3"-dideoxycytidine, 3TC) and the like; non-nucleoside reverse transciptase inhibitors such as suramine, pentamidine, thymopentin, castanospermine, dextran (dextran sulfate), foscamet-sodium (trisodium phdsphOno formate), nevirapine (1 l-cyclopropyl-5,1 l-dihydro-4-methyl-6H-dipyrido[3,2-b : 2",3"-e][l,4]diazepin-6-one), tacrine (tetrahydroarrurioacridine)and thelikepcompounds of the TIBO (tetrahydro-dmidazo{4,5, I -jk] [ 1,4]-benzodiazepirie-2(1H-one and thione)-type e.g. (S)-8-chloro-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-5-methyI-6-(3-methyl-2-buteriyI)imidazo-[4t5,l-jk][I,4]benzodiazepine-2(1H) -thione; compounds of the cc-APA (a-anilino phenyl acetamide) type e.g. a-[(2-nitro-phenyl)aniino]-2;6-ichIorobenzene-acetamide and the like; TAT-inhibitors, e.g. RO-5-3335 arid the like; protease inhibitors e.g. indinavir, ritanovir, saquinovir and the like; or immunomodulating agents, e.g. levamisole and the like. The compound of formula (I) or (I-a) can also be combined with another compound of formula (I) or (I-a).<br>
