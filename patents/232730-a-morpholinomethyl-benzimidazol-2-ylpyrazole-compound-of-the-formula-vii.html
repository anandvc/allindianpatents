				<td>The present invention relates to a morpholinomethyl-benzimidazol-2-ylpyrazole compound of the formula (VII).<br>
This invention relates to pyrazole compounds that inhibit or modulate the activity of Cyclin Dependent Kinases (CDK), Glycogen Synthase Kinases (GSK) and Aurora kinases to the use of the compounds in the treatment or prophylaxis of disease states or conditions mediated by the kinases, and to novel compounds having kinase inhibitory or modulating activity. Also provided are pharmaceutical compositions containing the compounds and novel chemical intermediates.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Protein kinases constitute a large family of structurally related enzymes that are responsible for the control of a wide variety of signal transduction processes within the cell (Hardie, G. and Hanks, S. (1995) The Protein Kinase Facts Book. I and II, Academic Press, San Diego, CA). The kinases may be categorized into families by the substrates they phosphorylate (e.g., protein-tyrosine, protein-serine/threonine, lipids, etc.). Sequence motifs have been identified that generally correspond to each of these kinase families (e.g., Hanks, S.K., Hunter, T., FASEBJ., 9:576-596 (1995); Knighton, et al., Science, 253:407-414 (1991); Hiles, etal, Cell, 70:419-429 (1992); Kunz, etal, Cell, 73:585-596 (1993); Garcia-Bustos, etal, EMBO J., 13:2352-2361 (1994)).<br>
Protein kinases may be characterized by their regulation mechanisms. These mechanisms include, for example, autophosphorylation, transphosphorylation by other kinases, protein-protein interactions, protein-lipid interactions, and protein-polynucleotide interactions. An individual protein kinase may be regulated by more than one mechanism.<br>
Kinases regulate many different cell processes including, but not limited to, proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, motility, transcription, translation and other signalling processes, by adding phosphate groups to target proteins. These phosphorylation events act as molecular on/off switches that can modulate or regulate the target protein biological function. Phosphorylation of target proteins<br>
occurs in response to a variety of extracellular signals (hormones, neurotransmitters, growth and differentiation factors, etc.), cell cycle events, environmental or nutritional stresses, etc. The appropriate protein kinase functions in signalling pathways to activate or inactivate (either directly or indirectly), for example, a metabolic enzyme, regulatory protein, receptor, cytoskeletal protein, ion channel or pump, or transcription factor. Uncontrolled signalling due to defective control of protein phosphorylation has been implicated in a number of diseases, including, for example, inflammation, cancer, allergy/asthma, disease and conditions of the immune system, disease and conditions of the central nervous system, and angiogenesis.<br>
Cyclin Dependent Kinases<br>
The process of eukaryotic cell division may be broadly divided into a series of sequential phases termed Gl, S, G2 and M. Correct progression through the various phases of the cell cycle has been shown to be critically dependent upon the spatial and temporal regulation of a family of proteins known as cyclin dependent kinases (cdks) and a diverse set of their cognate protein partners termed cyclins. Cdks are cdc2 (also known as cdkl) homologous serine-threonine kinase proteins that are able to utilise ATP as a substrate in the phosphorylation of diverse polypeptides in a sequence dependent context. Cyclins are a family of proteins characterised by a homology region, containing approximately 100 amino acids, termed the "cyclin box" which is used in binding to, and defining selectivity for, specific cdk partner proteins.<br>
Modulation of the expression levels, degradation rates, and activation levels of various cdks and cyclins throughout the cell cycle leads to the cyclical formation of a series of cdk/cyclin complexes, in which the cdks are enzymatically active. The formation of these complexes controls passage through discrete cell cycle checkpoints and thereby enables the process of cell division to continue. Failure to satisfy the pre-requisite biochemical criteria at a given cell cycle checkpoint, i.e.<br>
failure to form a required cdk/cyclin complex, can lead to cell cycle arrest and/or cellular apoptosis. Aberrant cellular proliferation, as manifested in cancer, can<br>
often be attributed to loss of correct cell cycle control. Inhibition of cdk enzymatic activity therefore provides a means by which abnormally dividing cells can have their division arrested and/or be killed. The diversity of cdks, and cdk complexes, and their critical roles in mediating the cell cycle, provides a broad spectrum of potential therapeutic targets selected on the basis of a defined biochemical rationale.<br>
Progression from the Gl phase to the S phase of the cell cycle is primarily regulated by cdk2, cdk3, cdk4 and cdk6 via association with members of the D and E type cyclins. The D-type cyclins appear instrumental in enabling passage beyond the Gl restriction point, where as the cdk2/cyclin E complex is key to the transition from the Gl to S phase. Subsequent progression through S phase and entry into G2 is thought to require the cdk2/cyclin A complex. Both mitosis, and the G2 to M phase transition which triggers it, are regulated by complexes of cdkl and the A and B type cyclins.<br>
During Gl phase Retinoblastoma protein (Rb), and related pocket proteins such as pl30, are substrates for cdk(2,4, &amp; 6)/cyclin complexes.   Progression through Gl is in part facilitated by hyperphosphorylation, and thus inactivation, of Rb and p130 by the cdk(4/6)/cyclin-D complexes. Hyperphosphorylation of Rb and p130 causes the release of transcription factors, such as E2F, and thus the expression of genes necessary for progression through Gl and for entry into S-phase, such as the gene for cyclin E. Expression of cyclin E facilitates formation of the cdk2/cyclin E complex which amplifies, or maintains, E2F levels via further phosphorylation of Rb.   The cdk2/cyclin E complex also phosphorylates other proteins necessary for DNA replication, such as NPAT, which has been implicated in histone biosynthesis. Gl progression and the Gl/S transition are also regulated via the mitogen stimulated Myc pathway, which feeds into the cdk2/cyclin E pathway. Cdk2 is also connected to the p53 mediated DNA damage response pathway via p53 regulation of p21 levels. p21 is a protein inhibitor of cdk2/cyclin E and is thus capable of<br>
blocking, or delaying, the Gl/S transition. The cdk2/cyclin E complex may thus represent a point at which biochemical stimuli from the Rb, Myc and p53 pathways are to some degree integrated. Cdk2 and/or the cdk2/cyclin E complex therefore<br>
represent good targets for therapeutics designed at arresting, or recovering control of, the cell cycle in aberrantly dividing cells.<br>
The exact role of cdk3 in the cell cycle is not clear. As yet no cognate cyclin partner has been identified, but a dominant negative form of cdk3 delayed cells in Gl, thereby suggesting that cdk3 has a role in regulating the Gl/S transition.<br>
Although most cdks have been implicated in regulation of the cell cycle there is evidence that certain members of the cdk family are involved in other biochemical processes. This is exemplified by cdk5 which is necessary for correct neuronal development and which has also been implicated in the phosphorylation of several neuronal proteins such as Tau, NUDE-1, synapsinl, DARPP32 and the Muncl8/SyntaxinlA complex. Neuronal cdk5 is conventionally activated by binding to the p35/p39 proteins. Cdk5 activity can, however, be deregulated by the binding of p25, a truncated version of p35. Conversion of p35 to p25, and subsequent deregulation of cdk5 activity, can be induced by ischemia, excitotoxicity, and P-amyloid peptide. Consequently p25 has been implicated in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's, and is therefore of interest as a target for therapeutics directed against these diseases.<br>
Cdk7 is a nuclear protein that has cdc2 CAK activity and binds to cyclin H. Cdk7 has been identified as component of the TFIIH transcriptional complex which has RNA polymerase II C-terminal domain (CTD) activity. This has been associated with the regulation of HIV-1 transcription via a Tat-mediated biochemical pathway. Cdk8 binds cyclin C and has been implicated in the phosphorylation of the CTD of RNA polymerase II. Similarly the cdk9/cyclin-Tl complex (P-TEFb complex) has been implicated in elongation control of RNA polymerase II. PTEF-b is also required for activation of transcription of the HIV-1 genome by the viral<br>
transactivator Tat through its interaction with cyclin Tl. Cdk7, cdk8, cdk9 and the P-TEFb complex are therefore potential targets for anti-viral therapeutics.<br>
At a molecular level mediation of cdk/cyclin complex activity requires a series of stimulatory and inhibitory phosphorylation, or dephosphorylation, events.   Cdk phosphorylation is performed by a group of cdk activating kinases (CAKs) and/or kinases such as weel, Mytl and Mikl. Dephosphorylation is performed by phosphatases such as cdc25(a &amp; c), pp2a, or KAP.<br>
Cdk/cyclin complex activity may be further regulated by two families of endogenous cellular proteinaceous inhibitors: the Kip/Cip family, or the INK family. The INK proteins specifically bind cdk4 and cdk6. pl6ink4 (also known as MTS1) is a potential tumour suppressor gene that is mutated, or deleted, in a large number of primary cancers. The Kip/Cip family contains proteins such as p21cipi,wafl} p27KiPi and p57kiP2  As discussed previously p21 is induced by p53 and<br>
is able to inactivate the cdk2/cyclin(E/A) and cdk4/cyclin(Dl/D2/D3) complexes. Atypically low levels of p27 expression have been observed in breast, colon and prostate cancers. Conversely over expression of cyclin E in solid tumours has been shown to correlate with poor patient prognosis. Over expression of cyclin Dl has been associated with oesophageal, breast, squamous, and non-small cell lung carcinomas.<br>
The pivotal roles of cdks, and their associated proteins, in co-ordinating and driving the cell cycle in proliferating cells have been outlined above. Some of the biochemical pathways in which cdks play a key role have also been described. The development of monotherapies for the treatment of proliferative disorders, such as cancers, using therapeutics targeted generically at cdks, or at specific cdks, is therefore potentially highly desirable. Cdk inhibitors could conceivably also be used to treat other conditions such as viral infections, autoimmune diseases and neuro-degenerative diseases, amongst others. Cdk targeted therapeutics may also provide clinical benefits in the treatment of the previously described diseases when used in combination therapy with either existing, or new, therapeutic agents. Cdk targeted anticancer therapies could potentially have advantages over many current<br>
antitumour agents as they would not directly interact with DNA and should therefore reduce the risk of secondary tumour development.<br>
Aurora Kinases<br>
Relatively recently, a new family of serine/threonine kinases known as the Aurora kinases has been discovered that are involved in the G2 and M phases of the cell cycle, and which are important regulators of mitosis.<br>
The precise role of Aurora kinases has yet to be elucidated but that they play a part in mitotic checkpoint control, chromosome dynamics and cytokinesis (Adams et al., Trends Cell Biol, 11: 49-54 (2001). Aurora kinases are located at the centrosomes of interphase cells, at the poles of the bipolar spindle and in the mid-body of the mitotic apparatus.<br>
Three members of the Aurora kinase family have been found in mammals so far (E. A. Nigg, Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2: 21-32, (2001)). These are:<br>
Aurora A (also referred to in the literature as Aurora 2);<br>
Aurora B (also referred to in the literature as Aurora 1); and<br>
Aurora C (also referred to in the literature as Aurora 3).<br>
The Aurora kinases have highly homologous catalytic domains but differ considerably in their N-terminal portions (Katayama H, Brinkley WR, Sen S.; The Aurora kinases: role in cell transformation and tumorigenesis; Cancer Metastasis Rev. 2003 Dec;22(4):451-64).<br>
The substrates of the Aurora kinases A and B have been identified as including a kinesin-like motor protein, spindle apparatus proteins, histone H3 protein, kinetochore protein and the tumour suppressor protein p53.<br>
Aurora A kinases are believed to be involved in spindle formation and become localised on the centrosome during the early G2 phase where they phosphorylate spindle-associated proteins (Prigent et al, Cell, 114: 531-535 (2003). Hirota et al, Cell, 114:585-598, (2003) found that cells depleted of Aurora A protein kinase were unable to enter mitosis. Furthermore, it has been found (Adams, 2001) that<br>
mutation or disruption of the Aurora A gene in various species leads to mitotic abnormalities, including centrosome separation and maturation defects, spindle aberrations and chromosome segregation defects.<br>
The Aurora kinases are generally expressed at a low level in the majority of normal tissues, the exceptions being tissues with a high proportion of dividing cells such as the thymus and testis. However, elevated levels of Aurora kinases have been found in many human cancers (Giet et al.,J. Cell. SC1- 112: 3591-361, (1999) and Katayama (2003). Furthermore, Aurora A kinase maps to the chromosome 20ql3 region that has frequently been found to be amplified in many human cancers.<br>
Thus, for example, significant Aurora A over-expression has been detected in human breast, ovarian and pancreatic cancers (see Zhou et al.,Nat. Genet. 20: 189-193, (1998), Tanaka et al, Cancer Res., 59: 2041-2044, (1999) and Han et al, cancer Res., 62: 2890-2896, (2002).<br>
Moreover, Isola, American Journal of Pathology 147,905-911 (1995) has reported that amplification of the Aurora A locus (20ql3) correlates with poor prognosis for patients with node-negative breast cancer.<br>
Amplification and/or over-expression of Aurora-A is observed in human bladder cancers and amplification of Aurora-A is associated with aneuploidy and aggressive clinical behaviour, see Sen et al,J. Natl.Cancer Inst, 94: 1320-1329 (2002).<br>
Elevated expression of Aurora-A has been detected in over 50% of colorectal cancers, (see Bischoff et al., EMBOJ., 17: 3052-3065, (1998) and Takahashi et al., Jpn. J. Cancer Res. , 91: 1007-1014 (2000)) ovarian cancers (see Gritsko et al. Clin. Cancer Res., 9: 1420-1426 (2003), and gastric tumours Sakakura et al., British Journal of Cancer, 84: 824-831 (2001).<br>
Tanaka et al. Cancer Research, 59: 2041-2044 (1999) found evidence of over-expression of Aurora A in 94% of invasive duct adenocarcinomas of the breast.<br>
High levels of Aurora A kinase have also been found in renal, cervical, neuroblastoma, melanoma, lymphoma, pancreatic and prostate tumour cell lines Bischoff et al. (1998), EMBO J., 17: 3052-3065 (1998); Kimura et al. J. Biol.<br>
Chem., 274: 7334-7340 (1999); Zhou et al., Nature Genetics, 20: 189-193 (1998); Li et al., Clin Cancer Res. 9 (3): 991-7 (2003) ].<br>
Aurora-B is highly expressed in multiple human tumour cell lines, including leukemic cells [Katayama et al., Gene 244: 1-7) ]. Levels of this enzyme increase as a function of Duke's stage in primary colorectal cancers [Katayama et al., J. Natl Cancer Inst, 91: 1160-1162(1999)].<br>
High levels of Aurora-3 (Aurora-C) have been detected in several tumour cell lines, even though this kinase tends to be restricted to germ cells in normal tissues (see Kimura et al. Journal of Biological Chemistry, 21 A: 7334-7340 (1999)). Over-expression of Aurora-3 in approximately 50% of colorectal cancers has also been reported in the article by Takahashi et al., Jpn J. Cancer Res. 91: 1007-1014 (2001)].<br>
Other reports of the role of Aurora kinases in proliferative disorders may be found in Bischoff et al, Trends in Cell Biology 9: 454-459 (1999); Giet et al. Journal of Cell Science, 112: 3591-3601 (1999) and Dutertre, etal. Oncogene, 21: 6175-6183 (2002).<br>
Royce et al report that the expression of the Aurora 2 gene (known as STK15 or BTAK) has been noted in approximately one-fourth of primary breast tumours. (Royce ME, Xia W, Sahin AA, Katayama H, Johnston DA, Hortobagyi G, Sen S, Hung MC; STK15/Aurora-A expression in primary breast tumours is correlated with nuclear grade but not with prognosis; Cancer. 2004 Jan l;100(l):12-9).<br>
Endometrial carcinoma (EC) comprises at least two types of cancer: endometrioid carcinomas (EECs) are estrogen-related tumours, which are frequently euploid and have a good prognosis. Nonendometrioid carcinomas (NEECs; serous and clear cell forms) are not estrogen related, are frequently aneuploid, and are clinically aggressive. It has also been found that Aurora was amplified in 55.5% of NEECs but not in any EECs (P <or g sanchez-estevez c cassia r rodriguez-perales s diaz-uriarte dominguez o hardisson d andujar m prat j matias-guiu x cigudosa jc palacios j. cancer res. sep></or>
Reichardt et al {Oncol Rep. 2003 Sep-Oct;10(5):1275-9)_have reported that quantitative DNA analysis by PCR to search for Aurora amplification in gliomas revealed that five out of 16 tumours (31%) of different WHO grade (lx grade II, lx grade III, 3x grade IV) showed DNA amplification of the Aurora 2 gene. It was hypothesized that amplification of the Aurora 2 gene may be a non-random genetic alteration in human gliomas playing a role in the genetic pathways of tumourigenesis.<br>
Results by Hamada et al {Br. J. Haematol. 2003 May;121(3):439-47) also suggest that Aurora 2 is an effective candidate to indicate not only disease activity but also tumourigenesis of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Retardation of tumour cell growth resulting from the restriction of this gene's functions could be a therapeutic approach for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.<br>
In a study by Gritsko et al {Clin Cancer Res. 2003 Apr; 9(4): 1420-6)), the kinase activity and protein levels of Aurora A were examined in 92 patients with primary ovarian tumours. In vitro kinase analyses revealed elevated Aurora A kinase activity in 44 cases (48%). Increased Aurora A protein levels were detected in 52 (57%) specimens. High protein levels of Aurora A correlated well with elevated kinase activity.<br>
Results obtained by Li et al {Clin. Cancer Res. 2003 Mar; 9(3):991-7) showed that the Aurora A gene is overexpressed in pancreatic tumours and carcinoma cell lines and suggest that overexpression of Aurora A may play a role in pancreatic carcinogenesis.<br>
Similarly, it has been shown that Aurora A gene amplification and associated increased expression of the mitotic kinase it encodes are associated with aneuploidy and aggressive clinical behaviour in human bladder cancer. {J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2002 Sep 4; 94(17): 1320-9).<br>
Investigation by several groups (Dutertre S, Prigent C.,Aurora-A overexpression leads to override of the microtubule-kinetochore attachment checkpoint; Mol.<br>
Interv. 2003 May; 3(3): 127-30 and Anand S, Penrhyn-Lowe S, Venkitaraman AR., Aurora-A amplification overrides the mitotic spindle assembly checkpoint, inducing resistance to Taxol, Cancer Cell. 2003 Jan;3(l):51-62) suggests that overexpression of Aurora kinase activity is associated with resistance to some current cancer therapies. For example overexpression of Aurora A in mouse embryo fibroblasts can reduce the sensitivity of these cells to the cytotoxic effects of taxane derivatives. Therefore Aurora kinase inhibitors may find particular use in patients who have developed reistance to existing therapies.<br>
On the basis of work carried out to date, it is envisaged that inhibition of Aurora kinases, particularly Aurora kinase A and Aurora kinase B, will prove an effective means of arresting tumour development.<br>
Harrington et al (Nat Med. 2004 Mar;10(3):262-7) have demonstrated that an inhibitor of the Aurora kinases suppresses tumour growth and induces tumour regression in vivo. In the study, the Aurora kinase inhibitor blocked cancer cell proliferation, and also triggered cell death in a range of cancer cell lines including leukaemic, colorectal and breast cell lines.<br>
Cancers which may be particularly amenable to Aurora inhibitors include breast, bladder, colorectal, pancreatic, ovarian, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, gliomas and nonendometrioid endometrial carcinomas.<br>
Glycogen Synthase Kinase<br>
Glycogen Synthase Kinase-3 (GSK3) is a serine-threonine kinase that occurs as two ubiquitously expressed isoforms in humans (GSK3α &amp; beta GSK3ß). GSK3 has been implicated as having roles in embryonic development, protein synthesis, cell proliferation, cell differentiation, microtubule dynamics, cell motility and cellular apoptosis. As such GSK3 has been implicated in the progression of disease states such as diabetes, cancer, Alzheimer's disease, stroke, epilepsy, motor neuron disease and/or head trauma. Phylogenetically GSK3 is most closely related to the cyclin dependent kinases (CDKs).<br>
The consensus peptide substrate sequence recognised by GSK3 is (Ser/Thr)-X-X-X-(pSer/pThr), where X is any amino acid (at positions (n+1), (n+2), (n+3)) and pSer and pThr are phospho-serine and phospho-threonine respectively (n+4). GSK3 phosphorylates the first serine, or threonine, at position (n). Phospho-serine, or phospho-threonine, at the (n+4) position appear necessary for priming GSK3 to give maximal substrate turnover. Phosphorylation of GSK3α at Ser21, or GSK3ß at Ser9, leads to inhibition of GSK3. Mutagenesis and peptide competition studies have led to the model that the phosphorylated N-terminus of GSK3 is able to compete with phospho-peptide substrate (S/TXXXpS/pT) via an autoinhibitory mechanism. There are also data suggesting that GSK3α and GSKP may be subtly regulated by phosphorylation of tyrosines 279 and 216 respectively. Mutation of these residues to a Phe caused a reduction in in vivo kinase activity. The X-ray crystallographic structure of GSK3(3 has helped to shed light on all aspects of GSK3 activation and regulation.<br>
GSK3 forms part of the mammalian insulin response pathway and is able to phosphorylate, and thereby inactivate, glycogen synthase. Upregulation of glycogen synthase activity, and thereby glycogen synthesis, through inhibition of GSK3, has thus been considered a potential means of combating type II, or non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM): a condition in which body tissues become resistant to insulin stimulation. The cellular insulin response in liver, adipose, or muscle tissues, is triggered by insulin binding to an extracellular insulin receptor. This causes the phosphorylation, and subsequent recruitment to the plasma membrane, of the insulin receptor substrate (IRS) proteins. Further phosphorylation of the IRS proteins initiates recruitment of phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI3K) to the plasma membrane where it is able to liberate the second messenger phosphatidylinosityl 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3). This facilitates co-localisation of 3-phosphoinositide-dedependent protein kinase 1 (PDKl) and protein kinase B (PKB or Akt) to the membrane, where PDKl activates PKB. PKB is able to phosphorylate, and thereby inhibit, GSK3α and/or GSKP through phosphorylation of Ser9, or ser21, respectively. The inhibition of GSK3 then<br>
triggers upregulation of glycogen synthase activity. Therapeutic agents able to inhibit GSK3 may thus be able to induce cellular responses akin to those seen on insulin stimulation.    A further in vivo substrate of GSK3 is the eukaryotic protein synthesis initiation factor 2B (eIF2B). eIF2B is inactivated via phosphorylation and is thus able to suppress protein biosynthesis. Inhibition of GSK3, e.g. by inactivation of the "mammalian target of rapamycin" protein (mTOR), can thus upregulate protein biosynthesis. Finally there is some evidence for regulation of GSK3 activity via the mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway through phosphorylation of GSK3 by kinases such as mitogen activated protein kinase activated protein kinase 1 (MAPKAP-K1 or RSK). These data suggest that GSK3 activity may be modulated by mitogenic, insulin and/or amino acid stimulii.<br>
It has also been shown that GSK3ß is a key component in the vertebrate Wnt signalling pathway. This biochemical pathway has been shown to be critical for normal embryonic development and regulates cell proliferation in normal tissues. GSK3 becomes inhibited in response to Wnt stimulii. This can lead to the de-phosphorylation of GSK3 substrates such as Axin, the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene product and (3-catenin. Aberrant regulation of the Wnt pathway has been associated with many cancers. Mutations in APC, and/or (3-catenin, are common in colorectal cancer and other tumours. P-catenin has also been shown to be of importance in cell adhesion. Thus GSK3 may also modulate cellular adhesion processes to some degree. Apart from the biochemical pathways already described there are also data implicating GSK3 in the regulation of cell division via phosphorylation of cyclin-Dl, in the phosphorylation of transcription factors such as c-Jun, CCAAT/enhancer binding protein a (C/EBPa), c-Myc and/or other substrates such as Nuclear Factor of Activated T-cells (NFATc), Heat Shock Factor-1 (HSF-1) and the c-AMP response element binding protein (CREB). GSK3 also appears to play a role, albeit tissue specific, in regulating cellular apoptosis. The role of GSK3 in modulating cellular apoptosis, via a pro-apoptotic mechanism, may be of particular relevance to medical conditions in which neuronal apoptosis can occur. Examples of these are head trauma, stroke, epilepsy, Alzheimer's and<br>
motor neuron diseases, progressive supranuclear palsy, corticobasal degeneration, and Pick's disease. In vitro it has been shown that GSK3 is able to hyper-phosphorylate the microtubule associated protein Tau. Hyperphosphorylation of Tau disrupts its normal binding to microtubules and may also lead to the formation of intra-cellular Tau filaments. It is believed that the progressive accumulation of these filaments leads to eventual neuronal dysfunction and degeneration. Inhbition of Tau phosphorylation, through inhibition of GSK3, may thus provide a means of limiting and/or preventing neurodegenerative effects.<br>

General Preferences and Definitions<br>
The following general preferences and definitions shall apply to each of the moieties R1d to R10, and their various sub-groups, sub-definitions, examples and embodiments unless the context indicates otherwise.<br>
Any references to formula (VII) herein shall also be taken to refer to formula (VIIa) and any other sub-group of compounds within formula (VII) unless the context requires otherwise.<br>
The term upregulation of Aurora kinase as used herein is defined as including elevated expression or over-expression of Aurora kinase, including gene amplification (i.e. multiple gene copies) and increased expression by a transcriptional effect, and hyperactivity and activation of Aurora kinase, including activation by mutations.<br>
References to "carbocyclic" and "heterocyclic" groups as used herein shall, unless the context indicates otherwise, include both aromatic and non-aromatic ring systems. Thus, for example, the term "carbocyclic and heterocyclic groups" includes within its scope aromatic, non-aromatic, unsaturated, partially saturated and fully saturated carbocyclic and heterocyclic ring systems. In general, such groups may be monocyclic or bicyclic and may contain, for example, 3 to 12 ring members, more usually 5 to 10 ring members. Examples of monocyclic groups are groups containing 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 ring members, more usually 3 to 7, and preferably 5 or 6 ring members. Examples of bicyclic groups are those containing 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12 ring members, and more usually 9 or 10 ring members.<br>
The carbocyclic or heterocyclic groups can be aryl or heteroaryl groups having from 5 to 12 ring members, more usually from 5 to 10 ring members. The term "aryl" as used herein refers to a carbocyclic group having aromatic character and the term "heteroaryl" is used herein to denote a heterocyclic group having aromatic character. The terms "aryl" and "heteroaryl" embrace polycyclic (e.g. bicyclic) ring systems wherein one or more rings are non-aromatic, provided that at least one ring is aromatic. In such polycyclic systems, the group may be attached by the aromatic ring, or by a non-aromatic ring. The aryl or heteroaryl groups can be monocyclic or bicyclic groups and can be unsubstituted or substituted with one or more substituents, for example one or more groups R   as defined herein.<br>
The term "non-aromatic group" embraces unsaturated ring systems without aromatic character, partially saturated and fully saturated carbocyclic and heterocyclic ring systems. The terms "unsaturated" and "partially saturated" refer to rings wherein the ring structure(s) contains atoms sharing more than one valence bond i.e. the ring contains at least one multiple bond e.g. a C=C, C=C or N=C bond.<br>
The term "fully saturated" refers to rings where there are no multiple bonds between ring atoms. Saturated carbocyclic groups include cycloalkyl groups as defined below. Partially saturated carbocyclic groups include cycloalkenyl groups as defined below, for example cyclopentenyl, cyclohexenyl, cycloheptenyl and cyclooctenyl.<br>

In another preferred sub-group of compounds, Rld is selected from 5-membered monocyclic heteroaryl groups containing a single oxygen heteroatom ring member and optionally a nitrogen heteroatom ring member, and being substituted by one to three substituents R10c provided that when the heteroaryl group contains a nitrogen ring member and is substituted by a methyl group, at least one substituent other than methyl is present. One such group is isoxazole substituted by a C2-4 alkyl group such as a propyl or butyl group, e.g. isobutyl.<br>
In another preferred sub-group of compounds, Rld is selected from three and five membered cycloalkyl groups substituted by one to three substituents R10c. Substituted cyclopropyl groups are particularly preferred, for example cyclopropyl group substituted by phenyl or cyano, e.g. 1-cyanocyclopropyl and 1-phenylcy clopropyl.<br>
In a further sub-group of compounds, R   is selected from a group Ph'CR17R18-where Ph' is a phenyl group substituted by one to three substituents R10c; R17 and<br>
1 O	1 -J<br>
R   are the same or different and each is selected from hydrogen and methyl; or R<br>
1 ft<br>
and R   together with the carbon atom to which they are attached form a<br>
17	1R<br>
cyclopropyl group; or one of R   andR   is hydrogen and the other is selected from amino, methylamino, C1-4 acylamino, and C1-4 alkoxycarbonylamino.<br>
The group Rld-A-NH or Rld-A-NH linked to the 4-position of the pyrazole ring can take the form of an amide Rld-C(=O)NH, urea RId-NHC(=O) or carbamate Rld-OC(=O). Amides and ureas are preferred. In one embodiment, the compound is an amide. In another embodiment, the compound is a urea.<br>
When Rld is a phenyl group, the phenyl group may be 2,6-disubstituted, 2,3-disubstituted, 2,4-disubstituted 2,5-disubstituted, 2,3,6-trisubstituted or 2,4,6-trisubstituted.    In one group of preferred compounds, the phenyl group Rlb is 2,6-disubstituted, 2,3-disubstituted or 2,4,6-trisubstituted. More particularly, a phenyl group R1 may be disubstituted at positions 2- and 6- with substituents selected from fluorine, chlorine and Ra-Rb, where Ra is O and Rb is C1-4 alkyl, with fluorine being a particular substituent. Alternatively, two adjacent substituents (preferably in the 2- and 3-positions), together with the phenyl ring to which they are attached, may form a 2, 3-dihydro-benzo[l,4]dioxine group, or an indolyl group or a 2,3-dihydrobenzofuranyl group.<br>
In another group of preferred compounds, the phenyl group Rld is 2,4-disubstituted or 2,5-disubstituted. The 2-substituent may be, for example, a halogen (e.g. F or CI) or a methoxy group. In one particular group of compounds, the 2-substituent is methoxy.   The 5-substituent, when present, can be selected from, for example, halogen (e.g. CI or F), C1-4 alkyl (e.g. tert-butyl or isopropyl), methoxy, trifluoromethoxy, trifluoromethyl, or a group HetN-SCh- where "HetN" is a nitrogen-containing saturated monocyclic heterocycle such as piperazino, N-CM alkylpiperazino, morpholino, piperidino or pyrrolidino. One preferred 5-subsitutent is CI, and a preferred 2,5-combination is 2-methoxy-5-chlorophenyl.<br>
In a further group of compounds, the phenyl group R   has a single substituent at the 4-position of the phenyl ring. The substituent can be, for example, a halogen atom (preferably fluorine or chlorine, most preferably fluorine) or a trifluoromethyl group.<br>
In another group of compounds, the phenyl group Rld is 2,4-disubstituted.<br>
When two adjacent substituents together with the phenyl ring to which they are attached form an indolyl group or a 2,3-dihydrobenzofuranyl group, it is preferred that the said groups are the 4-indolyl and 7-(2,3-dihydrobenzofuranyl) groups respectively.<br>
Where R   is mono-substituted, and the substituent is located at the 4-position of the phenyl ring, it is preferably other than a difluoromethoxy group or a 2-chloroethyl group.<br>
In one embodiment, where Rld is disubstituted, the substituted phenyl group may be other than a dimethoxyphenyl group, and may be other than a 2-fluoro-5-methoxyphenyl group.<br>
In another embodiment, the sub-group RIb may include the 2-fluoro-5-methoxyphenyl group. Such compounds have good activity against Aurora kinase.<br>
Where two adjacent substituents combine to form a ring so that R   is an indole group, the indole group is preferably other than an indol-7-yl group.<br>
One preferred sub-group of compounds of the invention is the group wherein Rlb is selected from the groups Al to A8, A10, A12 and A14 to A24 set out in Table 1 above.<br>
Particularly preferred groups Rld include 2,6-difluorophenyl, 2-fluoro-6-methoxyphenyl, 2-chloro-6-fluorophenyl, 2,6-dichlorophenyl, 2,4,6-trifluorophenyl and 2,3-dihydro-benzo[l,4]dioxine.<br>
One currently preferred group R   is 2,6-difluorophenyl.<br>
Compounds of the formula (VII) show good CDK inhibitory activity and are also particularly active against Aurora kinases.<br>
A particularly preferred sub-group of compounds within formula (VII) is represented by formula (Vila):<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
where Rld is as hereinbefore defined.<br>
For the avoidance of doubt, it is to be understood that each general and specific preference, embodiment and example of the groups R   may be combined with each general and specific preference, embodiment and example of the group R   and any sub-groups thereof and that all such combinations are embraced by this application.<br>
The various functional groups and substituents making up the compounds of the formula (VII) are typically chosen such that the molecular weight of the compound of the formula (VII) does not exceed 1000. More usually, the molecular weight of the compound will be less than 750, for example less than 700, or less than 650, or less than 600, or less than 550. More preferably, the molecular weight is less than 525 and, for example, is 500 or less.<br>
Particular and specific compounds of the invention are as illustrated in the examples below.<br>
Unless otherwise specified, a reference to a particular compound also includes ionic, salt, solvate, and protected forms thereof, for example, as discussed below.<br>
Many compounds of the formula (VII) can exist in the form of salts, for example acid addition salts or, in certain cases salts of organic and inorganic bases such as<br>
carboxylate, sulphonate and phosphate salts. All such salts are within the scope of this invention, and references to compounds of the formula (VII) include the salt forms of the compounds.<br>
Acid addition salts may be formed with a wide variety of acids, both inorganic and organic. Examples of acid addition salts include salts formed with hydrochloric, hydriodic, phosphoric, nitric, sulphuric, citric, lactic, succinic, maleic, malic, isethionic, fumaric, benzenesulphonic, toluenesulphonic, methanesulphonic, ethanesulphonic, naphthalenesulphonic, valeric, acetic, propanoic, butanoic, malonic, glucuronic and lactobionic acids.<br>
For example, if the compound is anionic, or has a functional group which may be anionic (e.g., -COOH may be -COO"), then a salt may be formed with a suitable cation. Examples of suitable inorganic cations include, but are not limited to, alkali metal ions such as Na+ and K+, alkaline earth metal cations such as Ca2+ and Mg2+, and other cations such as Al   . Examples of suitable organic cations include, but are not limited to, ammonium ion (i.e., NH/) and substituted ammonium ions (e.g., NH3R , NH2R2 , NHR3 , NR4 ). Examples of some suitable substituted ammonium ions are those derived from: ethylamine, diethylamine, dicyclohexylamine, triethylamine, butylamine, ethylenediamine, ethanolamine, diethanolamine, piperazine, benzylamine, phenylbenzylamine, choline, meglumine, and tromethamine, as well as amino acids, such as lysine and arginine. An example of a common quaternary ammonium ion is N(CH3)4+.<br>
Where the compounds of the formula (VII) contain an amine function, these may form quaternary ammonium salts, for example by reaction with an alkylating agent according to methods well known to the skilled person. Such quaternary ammonium salts are within the scope of formula (VII).<br>
The salt forms of the compounds of theinvention are typically pharmaceutically acceptable salts, and examples of pharmaceutically acceptable salts are discussed in Berge etai, 1977, "Pharmaceutically Acceptable Salts," J. Pharm. Sci, Vol. 66, pp. 1-19. However, salts that are not pharmaceutically acceptable may also be<br>
prepared as intermediate forms which may then be converted into pharmaceutically acceptable salts.   Such non-pharmaceutically acceptable salts forms, which may be useful, for example, in the purification or separation of the compounds of the invention, also form part of the invention.<br>
Compounds of the formula (VII) containing an amine function may also form N-oxides. A reference herein to a compound of the formula (VII) that contains an amine function also includes the N-oxide.<br>
Where a compound contains several amine functions, one or more than one nitrogen atom may be oxidised to form an N-oxide. Particular examples of N-oxides are the N-oxides of a tertiary amine or a nitrogen atom of a nitrogen-containing heterocycle.<br>
N-Oxides can be formed by treatment of the corresponding amine with an oxidizing agent such as hydrogen peroxide or a per-acid (e.g. a peroxycarboxylic acid), see for example Advanced Organic Chemistry, by Jerry March, 4th Edition, Wiley Interscience, pages. More particularly, N-oxides can be made by the procedure of L. W. Deady (Syn. Comm. 1977, 7, 509-514) in which the amine compound is reacted with zn-chloroperoxybenzoic acid (MCPBA), for example, in an inert solvent such as dichloromethane.<br>
Compounds of the formula may exist in a number of different geometric isomeric, and tautomeric forms and references to compounds of the formula (VII) include all such forms. For the avoidance of doubt, where a compound can exist in one of several geometric isomeric or tautomeric forms and only one is specifically described or shown, all others are nevertheless embraced by formula (VII).<br>
For example, in compounds of the formula (II) the benzimidazole group may take either of the following two tautomeric forms A and B (wherein in each case andR6 are hydrogen and R is morpholinylmethyl). For simplicity, the general formula (II) illustrates form A but the formula is to be taken as embracing both tautomeric forms.<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
The pyrazole ring may also exhibit tautomerism and can exist in the two tautomeric forms C and D below.<br><br><br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
Other examples of tautomeric forms include, for example, keto-, enol-, and enolate-forms, as in, for example, the following tautomeric pairs: keto/enol (illustrated below), imine/enamine, amide/imino alcohol, amidine/amidine, nitroso/oxime, thioketone/enethiol, and nitro/aC1-nitro.<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
Where compounds of the formula (VII) contain one or more chiral centres, and can exist in the form of two or more optical isomers, references to compounds of the formula (VII) include all optical isomeric forms thereof (e.g. enantiomers, epimers and diastereoisomers), either as individual optical isomers, or mixtures or two or more optical isomers, unless the context requires otherwise.<br>
The optical isomers may be characterised and identified by their optical activity (i.e. as + and - isomers, or d and / isomers) or they may be characterised in terms of their absolute stereochemistry using the "R and S" nomenclature developed by<br>
Cahn, Ingold and Prelog, see Advanced Organic Chemistry by Jerry March, 4 Edition, John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York, 1992, pages 109-114, and see also Cahn, Ingold &amp; Prelog, Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl., 1966, 5, 385-415.<br>
Optical isomers can be separated by a number of techniques including chiral chromatography (chromatography on a chiral support) and such techniques are well known to the person skilled in the art.<br>
Where compounds of the formula (VII) exist as two or more optical isomeric forms, one enantiomer in a pair of enantiomers may exhibit advantages over the other enantiomer, for example, in terms of biological activity. Thus, in certain circumstances, it may be desirable to use as a therapeutic agent only one of a pair of enantiomers, or only one of a plurality of diastereoisomers. Accordingly, the invention provides compositions containing a compound of the formula (VII) having one or more chiral centres, wherein at least 55% (e.g. at least 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90% or 95%) of the compound of the formula (VII) is present as a single optical isomer (e.g. enantiomer or diastereoisomer). In one general embodiment, 99% or more (e.g. substantially all) of the total amount of the compound of the formula (VII) may be present as a single optical isomer (e.g. enantiomer or diastereoisomer).<br>
The compounds of the invention include compounds with one or more isotopic substitutions, and a reference to a particular element includes within its scope all isotopes of the element. For example, a reference to hydrogen includes within its scope H, H (D), and H (T). Similarly, references to carbon and oxygen include within their scope respectively I2C, I3C and I4C and I60 and 180.<br>
The isotopes may be radioactive or non-radioactive. In one embodiment of the invention, the compounds contain no radioactive isotopes. Such compounds are preferred for therapeutic use. In another embodiment, however, the compound may contain one or more radioisotopes. Compounds containing such radioisotopes may be useful in a diagnostic context.<br>
Esters such as carboxylic acid esters and acyloxy esters of the compounds of formula (VII) bearing a carboxylic acid group or a hydroxyl group are also embraced by Formula (VII). Examples of esters are compounds containing the group -C(=O)OR, wherein R is an ester substituent, for example, a C1-7 alkyl group, a C3.20 heterocyclyl group, or a C5.20 aryl group, preferably a C1-7 alkyl group. Particular examples of ester groups include, but are not limited to, -C(=O)OCH3, -C(=O)OCH2CH3, -C(=O)OC(CH3)3, and -C(=O)OPh. Examples of acyloxy (reverse ester) groups are represented by -OC(=O)R, wherein R is an acyloxy substituent, for example, a C1.7 alkyl group, a C3-20 heterocyclyl group, or a C5.20 aryl group, preferably a C1.7 alkyl group. Particular examples of acyloxy groups include, but are not limited to, -OC(=O)CH3 (acetoxy), -OC(=O)CH2CH3, -OC(=O)C(CH3)3, -OC(=O)Ph, and -OC(=O)CH2Ph.<br>
Also encompassed by formula (VII) are any polymorphic forms of the compounds, solvates (e.g. hydrates), complexes (e.g. inclusion complexes or clathrates with compounds such as cyclodextrins, or complexes with metals) of the compounds, and pro-drugs of the compounds. By "prodrugs" is meant for example any compound that is converted in vivo into a biologically active compound of the formula (VII).<br>
For example, some prodrugs are esters of the active compound (e.g., a physiologically acceptable metabolically labile ester). During metabolism, the ester group (-C(=O)OR) is cleaved to yield the active drug. Such esters may be formed by esterification, for example, of any of the carboxylic acid groups (-C(=O)OH) in the parent compound, with, where appropriate, prior protection of any other reactive groups present in the parent compound, followed by deprotection if required.<br>
Examples of such metabolically labile esters include those of the formula -<br>
C(=O)OR wherein R is:<br>
C1-7alkyl<br>
(e.g., -Me, -Et, -nPr, -iPr, -nBu, -sBu, -iBu, -tBu);<br>
C1-7aminoalkyl<br>
(e.g., aminoethyl; 2-(N,N-diethylamino)ethyl; 2-(4-morpholino)ethyl); and<br>
acyloxy-C1-7alkyl<br>
(e.g., acyloxymethyl;<br>
acyloxy ethyl;<br>
pivaloyloxymethyl;<br>
acetoxymethyl;<br>
1-acetoxyethyl;<br>
1 -(1 -methoxy-1 -methyl)ethyl-carbonxyloxy ethyl;<br>
1 -(benzoyloxy)ethyl; isopropoxy-carbonyloxymethyl;<br>
1 -isopropoxy-carbonyloxyethyl; cyclohexyl-carbonyloxymethyl;<br>
1 -cyclohexyl-carbonyloxyethyl;<br>
cyclohexyloxy-carbonyloxymethyl;<br>
1 -cyclohexyloxy-carbonyloxyethyl;<br>
(4-tetrahydropyranyloxy)carbonyloxymethyl;<br>
l-(4-tetrahydropyranyloxy)carbonyloxyethyl;<br>
(4-tetrahydropyranyl)carbonyloxymethyl; and<br>
1 -(4-tetrahydropyranyl)carbonyloxy ethyl).<br>
Also, some prodrugs are activated enzymatically to yield the active compound, or a compound which, upon further chemical reaction, yields the active compound (for example, as in ADEPT, GDEPT, LIDEPT, etc.). For example, the prodrug may be a sugar derivative or other glycoside conjugate, or may be an amino acid ester derivative.<br>
Biological Activity<br>
The compounds of the formula (VII) are inhibitors of cyclin dependent kinases. For example, compounds of the invention have activity against CDK1, CDK2, CDK3, CDK5, CDK6 and CDK7 kinases.<br>
In addition, CDK4, CDK8 and/or CDK9 may be of interest.<br>
Compounds of the invention also have activity against glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3).<br>
Compounds of the invention also have activity against Aurora kinases.<br>
As a consequence of their activity in modulating or inhibiting CDK and Aurora kinases and glycogen synthase kinase, they are expected to be useful in providing a means of arresting, or recovering control of, the cell cycle in abnormally dividing cells. It is therefore anticipated that the compounds will prove useful in treating or preventing proliferative disorders such as cancers. It is also envisaged that the compounds of the invention will be useful in treating conditions such as viral infections, autoimmune diseases and neurodegenerative diseases for example.<br>
CDKs play a role in the regulation of the cell cycle, apoptosis, transcription, differentiation and CNS function. Therefore, CDK inhibitors could be useful in the treatment of diseases in which there is a disorder of proliferation, apoptosis or differentiation such as cancer. In particular RB+ve tumours may be particularly sensitive to CDK inhibitors. RB-ve tumours may also be sensitive to CDK inhibitors.<br>
Examples of cancers which may be inhibited include, but are not limited to, a carcinoma, for example a carcinoma of the bladder, breast, colon (e.g. colorectal carcinomas such as colon adenocarcinoma and colon adenoma), kidney, epidermis, liver, lung, for example adenocarcinoma, small cell lung cancer and non-small cell lung carcinomas, oesophagus, gall bladder, ovary, pancreas e.g. exocrine pancreatic carcinoma, stomach, cervix, thyroid, prostate, or skin, for example squamous cell carcinoma; a hematopoietic tumour of lymphoid lineage, for example leukemia, acute lymphocytic leukemia, B-cell lymphoma, T-cell lymphoma, Hodgkin's lymphoma, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, hairy cell lymphoma, or Burkett's lymphoma; a hematopoietic tumour of myeloid lineage, for example acute and chronic myelogenous leukemias, myelodysplastic syndrome, or promyelocyte leukemia; thyroid follicular cancer; a tumour of mesenchymal origin, for example fibrosarcoma or habdomyosarcoma; a tumour of the central or peripheral nervous system, for example astrocytoma, neuroblastoma, glioma or schwannoma; melanoma; seminoma; teratocarcinoma; osteosarcoma; xenoderoma pigmentoum; keratoctanthoma; thyroid follicular cancer; or Kaposi's sarcoma.<br>
CDKs are also known to play a role in apoptosis, proliferation, differentiation and transcription and therefore CDK inhibitors could also be useful in the treatment of the following diseases other than cancer; viral infections, for example herpes virus, pox virus, Epstein-Barr virus, Sindbis virus, adenovirus, HIV, HPV, HCV and HCMV; prevention of AIDS development in HIV-infected individuals; chronic inflammatory diseases, for example systemic lupus erythematosus, autoimmune mediated glomerulonephritis, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, inflammatory bowel disease, and autoimmune diabetes mellitus; cardiovascular diseases for example cardiac hypertrophy, restenosis, atherosclerosis; neurodegenerative disorders, for example Alzheimer's disease, AIDS-related dementia, Parkinson's disease, amyotropic lateral sclerosis, retinitis pigmentosa, spinal muscular atropy and cerebellar degeneration; glomerulonephritis; myelodysplastic syndromes, ischemic injury associated myocardial infarctions, stroke and reperfusion injury, arrhythmia, atherosclerosis, toxin-induced or alcohol related liver diseases, haematological diseases, for example, chronic anemia and aplastic anemia; degenerative diseases of the musculoskeletal system, for example, osteoporosis and arthritis, aspirin-senstive rhinosinusitis, cystic fibrosis, multiple sclerosis, kidney diseases and cancer pain.<br>
It has also been discovered that some cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors can be used in combination with other anticancer agents. For example, the cytotoxic activity of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor flavopiridol, has been used with other anticancer agents in combination therapy.<br>
Thus, in the pharmaceutical compositions, uses or methods of this invention for treating a disease or condition comprising abnormal cell growth, the disease or condition comprising abnormal cell growth in one embodiment is a cancer.<br>
Particular subsets of cancers include breast cancer, ovarian cancer, colon cancer, prostate cancer, oesophageal cancer, squamous cancer and non-small cell lung carcinomas.<br>
In the case of compounds having activity against Aurora kinase, particular examples of cancers where it is envisaged that the Aurora kinase inhibiting compounds of the invnention will be useful include:<br>
human breast cancers (e.g. primary breast tumours, node-negative breast cancer, invasive duct adenocarcinomas of the breast, non-endometrioid breast cancers);<br>
ovarian cancers (e.g. primary ovarian tumours);<br>
pancreatic cancers;<br>
human bladder cancers;<br>
colorectal cancers (e.g. primary colorectal cancers);<br>
gastric tumours;<br>
renal cancers;<br>
cervical cancers:<br>
neuroblastomas;<br>
melanomas;<br>
lymphomas;<br>
prostate cancers;<br>
leukemia;<br>
non-endometrioid endometrial carcinomas;<br>
gliomas;<br>
non-Hodgkin's lymphoma;<br>
Cancers which may be particularly amenable to Aurora inhibitors include breast, bladder, colorectal, pancreatic, ovarian, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, gliomas and nonendometrioid endometrial carcinomas.<br>
The activity of the compounds of the invention as inhibitors of cyclin dependent kinases, Aurora kinases and glycogen synthase kinase-3 can be measured using the<br>
assays set forth in the examples below and the level of activity exhibited by a given compound can be defined in terms of the IC50 value. Preferred compounds of the present invention are compounds having an IC50 value of less than 1 micromole, more preferably less than 0.1 micromole.<br>
Methods for the Preparation of Compounds of the Formula (VII)<br>
Compounds of the formula (VII) can be prepared in accordance with synthetic methods well known to the skilled person.<br>
Unless stated otherwise Rld is as herein defined.<br>
Compounds of the formula (VII) wherein R1 -A- forms an acyl group can be prepared as illustrated in Scheme 1 below.<br>
In Scheme 1, R2 is hydrogen and the moieties R3 and R4 together with the carbon atoms to which they are attached form a benzene ring substituted with a morpholinylmethyl group.<br>
As shown in Scheme 1, an amine of the formula (X) can be reacted with with a carboxylic acid, or reactive derivative thereof, of the formula R -CO2H under standard amide formation conditions. Thus, for example, the coupling reaction between the carboxylic acid and the amine (X) can be carried out in the presence of a reagent of the type commonly used in the formation of peptide linkages. Examples of such reagents include 1,3-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC) (Sheehan et al, J. Amer. ChemSoc. 1955,77, 1067), l-ethyl-3-(3'-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide (EDC) (Sheehan et al, J. Org. Chem., 1961, 26, 2525), uronium-based coupling agents such as 0-(7-azabenzotriazol-l-yl)-A^A^A^',A^'-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate (HATU) (L. A. Carpino, J. Amer. Chem. Soc, 1993, 115, 4397) and phosphonium-based coupling agents such as 1-benzo-triazolyloxytris(pyrrolidino)phosphonium hexafluorophosphate (PyBOP) (Castro et<br>
al, Tetrahedron Letters, 1990, 31, 205). Carbodiimide-based coupling agents are advantageously used in combination with 1-hydroxyazabenzotriazole (HOAt) or 1-hydroxybenzotriazole (HOBt) (Konig et al, Chem. Ber., 103, 708, 2024-2034). Preferred coupling reagents include EDC and DCC in combination with HO At or HOBt.<br>
(Scheme Removed) <br>
Scheme 1<br>
The coupling reaction is typically carried out in a non-aqueous, non-protic solvent such as acetonitrile, dioxan, dimethylsulphoxide, dichloromethane,<br>
dimethylformamide or N-methylpyrrolidine, or in an aqueous solvent optionally together with one or more miscible co-solvents. The reaction can be carried out at<br>
room temperature or, where the reactants are less reactive (for example in the case of electron-poor anilines bearing electron withdrawing groups such as sulphonamide groups) at an appropriately elevated temperature. The reaction may be carried out in the presence of a non-interfering base, for example a tertiary amine such as triethylamine or N, N-diisopropylethylamine.<br>
As an alternative, a reactive derivative of the carboxylic acid, e.g. an anhydride or acid chloride, may be used. Reaction with a reactive derivative such an anhydride is typically accomplished by stirring the amine and anhydride at room temperature in the presence of a base such as pyridine.<br>
Amines of the formula (X) can be prepared by reduction of the corresponding nitrocompound of the formula (XI) under standard conditions. The reduction may be effected, for example by catalytic hydrogenation in the presence of a catalyst such as palladium on carbon in a polar solvent such as ethanol or dimethylformamide at room temperature.<br>
The compounds of the formula (XI) can be prepared by reaction of a nitro-pyrazole carboxylic acid of the formula (XII) with a diamine of the formula (XII). The reaction between the diamine (XIII) and carboxylic acid (XII) can be carried out in the presence of a reagent such as DCC or EDC in the presence of HOBt as described above, under amide coupling conditions as described previously, to give an intermediate ort/zo-aminophenylamide (not shown) which is then cyclised to form the benzimidazole ring. The final cyclisation step is typically carried out by heating under reflux in the presence of acetic acid.<br>
Diamines of the formula (XIII) can be obtained commercially or can be prepared from appropriately substituted phenyl precursor compounds using standard chemistry and well known functional group interconversions, see for example, Fiesers' Reagents for Organic Synthesis, Volumes 1-17, John Wiley, edited by Mary Fieser (ISBN: 0-471-58283-2), and Organic Syntheses, Volumes 1-8, John Wiley, edited by Jeremiah P. Freeman (ISBN: 0-471-31192-8),<br>
1995. Examples of methods of preparing diamines of the formula (XIII) are provided in the examples below.<br>
The diamines of the formula (XIII) can also be reacted with carboxylic acids of the formula (XIV) to give compounds of the formula (VII).<br><br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
The reaction of the diamine (XIII) with the carboxylic acid (XIV) can be carried out under conditions analogous to those described above for preparing the nitrocompounds (XI). Carboxylic acids of the formula (XIV) can be prepared by the sequence of reactions shown in Scheme 2.<br>
As shown in Scheme 2, a substituted or unsubstituted 4-nitro-3-pyrazole carboxylic acid (XV) can be esterified by reaction with thionyl chloride to give the acid chloride intermediate followed by reaction with ethanol to form the ethyl ester (XVI). Alternatively, the esterification can be carried out by reacting the alcohol and carboxylic acid in the presence of an acidic catalyst, one example of which is thionyl chloride. The reaction is typically carried out at room temperature using the esterifying alcohol (e.g. ethanol) as the solvent. The nitro group can then be reduced using palladium on carbon according to standard methods to give the amine (XVII). The amine (XVII) is coupled with an appropriate carboxylic acid R'-CCbH under amide forming conditions the same as or analogous to those described above to give the amide (XVIII). The ester group of the amide (XVIII) can then be hydrolysed using an alkali metal hydroxide such as sodium hydroxide in a polar water miscible solvent such as methanol, typically at room temperature.<br>
(Scheme Removed)  <br>
Scheme 2<br>
Compounds of the formula (VII) in which A is NH(CO) can be prepared using standard methods for the synthesis of ureas. For example, such compounds can be prepared by reacting an aminopyrazole compound of the formula (X) with a suitably substituted phenylisocyanate in a polar solvent such as DMF. The reaction is conveniently carried out at room temperature.<br>
A further route to compounds of the formula (VII) is shown in Scheme 3 below.<br>
In Scheme 3, X is N and the moieties R3 and R4 together with the carbon atoms to which they are attached form a benzene ring substituted with a morpholinylmethyl group.<br>
(Scheme Removed) <br>
Scheme 3<br>
As illustrated in Scheme 3, the ketone (XIX) can be reacted with dimethylformamide-dimethylacetal at elevated temperature to give an a,P-unsaturated ketone (XX) (Jachak et al, Montash. Chem., 1993,124(2), 199-207), which upon heating with hydrazine hydrate gives a pyrazole of formula (XXI). This can then be nitrated as discussed herein to give the nitropyrazole (XXII).<br>
The starting materials for the synthetic routes shown in the Schemes above, pyrazoles of Formula (XII) and (XV), can either be obtained commercially or can be prepared by methods known to those skilled in the art. They can be obtained using known methods e.g. from ketones, such as in a process described in EP308020 (Merck), or the methods discussed by Schmidt in Helv. Chim. Acta., 1956, 39, 986-991 and Helv. Chim. Acta., 1958, 41, 306-309. Alternatively they<br>
can be obtained by conversion of a commercially available pyrazole, for example those containing halogen, nitro, ester, or amide functionalities, to pyrazoles containing the desired functionality by standard methods known to a person skilled in the art. For example, in 3-carboxy-4-nitropyrazole, the nitro group can be reduced to an amine by standard methods. 4-Nitro-pyrazole-3-carboxylic acid (XII) can either be obtained commercially or can be prepared by nitration of the corresponding 4-unsubstituted pyrazole carboxy compound, and pyrazoles containing a halogen, may be utilized in coupling reactions with tin or palladium chemistry. A substituted or unsubstituted 4-nitro-3-pyrazole carboxylic acid can be esterified by reaction with thionyl chloride to give the acid chloride intermediate followed by reaction with an alcohol to form the ester of formula (XVI). Alternatively, the esterification can be carried out by reacting the alcohol and carboxylic acid in the presence of an acidic catalyst, one example of which is thionyl chloride. The reaction is typically carried out at room temperature using the esterifying alcohol (e.g. ethanol) as the solvent.<br>
In many of the reactions described above, it may be necessary to protect one or more groups to prevent reaction from taking place at an undesirable location on the molecule. Examples of protecting groups, and methods of protecting and deprotecting functional groups, can be found in Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis (T. Green and P. Wuts; 3rd Edition; John Wiley and Sons, 1999). A hydroxy group may be protected, for example, as an ether (-OR) or an ester (-OC(=O)R), for example, as: a t-butyl ether; a benzyl, benzhydryl (diphenylmethyl), or trityl (triphenylmethyl) ether; a trimethylsilyl or t-butyldimethylsilyl ether; or an acetyl ester (-OC(=O)CH3, -OAc). An aldehyde or ketone group may be protected, for example, as an acetal (R-CH(OR)2) or ketal (R2C(OR)2), respectively, in which the carbonyl group (&gt;C=O) is converted to a diether (&gt;C(OR)2), by reaction with, for example, a primary alcohol. The aldehyde or ketone group is readily regenerated by hydrolysis using a large excess of water in the presence of acid. An amine group may be protected, for example, as an amide (-NRCO-R) or a urethane (-NRCO-OR), for example, as: a methyl amide (-NHCO-CH3); a benzyloxy amide (-NHCO-OCH2C6H5, -NH-Cbz); as a t-butoxy amide (-NHCO-OC(CH3)3,<br>
-NH-Boc); a 2-biphenyl-2-propoxy amide (-NHCO-OCCCHsfcCeliiCeHs, -NH-Bpoc), as a 9-fluorenylmethoxy amide (-NH-Fmoc), as a 6-nitroveratryloxy amide (-NH-Nvoc), as a 2-trimethylsilylethyloxy amide (-NH-Teoc), as a 2,2,2-trichloroethyloxy amide (-NH-Troc), as an allyloxy amide (-NH-Alloc), or as a 2(-phenylsulphonyl)ethyloxy amide (-NH-Psec). Other protecting groups for amines, such as cyclic amines and heterocyclic N-H groups, include toluenesulphonyl (tosyl) and methanesulphonyl (mesyl) groups and benzyl groups such as a para-methoxybenzyl (PMB) group. A carboxylic acid group may be protected as an ester for example, as: an C1.7 alkyl ester (e.g., a methyl ester; a t-butyl ester); a C1-7 haloalkyl ester (e.g., a C1-7 trihaloalkyl ester); a triC1-7alkylsilyl-C1-7alkyl ester; or a C5-20 aryl-C1-7 alkyl ester (e.g., a benzyl ester; a nitrobenzyl ester); or as an amide, for example, as a methyl amide. A thiol group may be protected, for example, as a thioether (-SR), for example, as: a benzyl thioether; an acetamidomethyl ether (-S-CH2NHC(=O)CH3).<br>
Methods of Purification<br>
The compounds may be isolated and purified by a number of methods well known to those skilled in the art and examples of such methods include chromatographic techniques such as column chromatography (e.g. flash chromatography) and HPLC. Preparative LC-MS is a standard and effective method used for the purification of small organic molecules such as the compounds described herein. The methods for the liquid chromatography (LC) and mass spectrometry (MS) can be varied to provide better separation of the crude materials and improved detection of the samples by MS. Optimisation of the preparative gradient LC method will involve varying columns, volatile eluents and modifiers, and gradients. Methods are well known in the art for optimising preparative LC-MS methods and then using them to purify compounds. Such methods are described in Rosentreter U, Huber U.; Optimal fraction collecting in preparative LC/MS; J Comb Chem.; 2004; 6(2), 159-64 and Leister W, Strauss K, Wisnoski D, Zhao Z, Lindsley C, Development of a custom high-throughput preparative liquid chromatography/mass spectrometer<br>
platform for the preparative purification and analytical analysis of compound libraries; J Comb Chem.; 2003; 5(3); 322-9.<br>
One such system for purifying compounds via preparative LC-MS is described in the experimental section below although a person skilled in the art will appreciate that alternative systems and methods to those described could be used. In particular, normal phase preparative LC based methods might be used in place of the reverse phase methods described here. Most preparative LC-MS systems utilise reverse phase LC and volatile acidic modifiers, since the approach is very effective for the purification of small molecules and because the eluents are compatible with positive ion electrospray mass spectrometry. Employing other chromatographic solutions e.g. normal phase LC, alternatively buffered mobile phase, basic modifiers etc as outlined in the analytical methods described above could alternatively be used to purify the compounds.<br>
Pharmaceutical Formulations<br>
While it is possible for the active compound to be administered alone, it is preferable to present it as a pharmaceutical composition (e.g. formulation) comprising at least one active compound, as defined above, together with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, adjuvants, excipients, diluents, fillers, buffers, stabilisers, preservatives, lubricants, or other materials well known to those skilled in the art and optionally other therapeutic or prophylactic agents.<br>
Thus, the present invention further provides pharmaceutical compositions, as defined above, and methods of making a pharmaceutical composition comprising admixing at least one active compound, as defined above, together with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, excipients, buffers, adjuvants, stabilizers, or other materials, as described herein.<br>
The term "pharmaceutically acceptable" as used herein pertains to compounds, materials, compositions, and/or dosage forms which are, within the scope of sound medical judgment, suitable for use in contact with the tissues of a subject (e.g.<br>
human) without excessive toxicity, irritation, allergic response, or other problem or complication, commensurate with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio. Each carrier, excipient, etc. must also be "acceptable" in the sense of being compatible with the other ingredients of the formulation.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions can be in any form suitable for oral, parenteral, topical, intranasal, ophthalmic, otic, rectal, intra-vaginal, or transdermal administration. Where the compositions are intended for parenteral administration, they can be formulated for intravenous, intramuscular, intraperitoneal, subcutaneous administration or for direct delivery into a target organ or tissue by injection, infusion or other means of delivery.<br>
Pharmaceutical dosage forms suitable for oral administration include tablets, capsules, caplets, pills, lozenges, syrups, solutions, powders, granules, elixirs and suspensions, sublingual tablets, wafers or patches and buccal patches.<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions containing compounds of the formula (VII) can be formulated in accordance with known techniques, see for example, Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, Mack Publishing Company, Easton, PA, USA.<br>
Thus, tablet compositions can contain a unit dosage of active compound together with an inert diluent or carrier such as a sugar or sugar alcohol, eg; lactose, sucrose, sorbitol or mannitol; and/or a non-sugar derived diluent such as sodium carbonate, calcium phosphate, calcium carbonate, or a cellulose or derivative thereof such as methyl cellulose, ethyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose, and starches such as corn starch. Tablets may also contain such standard ingredients as binding and granulating agents such as polyvinylpyrrolidone, disintegrants (e.g. swellable crosslinked polymers such as crosslinked carboxymethylcellulose), lubricating agents (e.g. stearates), preservatives (e.g. parabens), antioxidants (e.g. BHT), buffering agents (for example phosphate or citrate buffers), and effervescent agents such as citrate/bicarbonate mixtures. Such excipients are well known and do not need to be discussed in detail here.<br>
Capsule formulations may be of the hard gelatin or soft gelatin variety and can contain the active component in solid, semi-solid, or liquid form. Gelatin capsules can be formed from animal gelatin or synthetic or plant derived equivalents thereof.<br>
The solid dosage forms (eg; tablets, capsules etc.) can be coated or un-coated, but typically have a coating, for example a protective film coating (e.g. a wax or varnish) or a release controlling coating. The coating (e.g. a Eudragit ™ type polymer) can be designed to release the active component at a desired location within the gastro-intestinal tract. Thus, the coating can be selected so as to degrade under certain pH conditions within the gastrointestinal tract, thereby selectively release the compound in the stomach or in the ileum or duodenum.<br>
Instead of, or in addition to, a coating, the drug can be presented in a solid matrix comprising a release controlling agent, for example a release delaying agent which may be adapted to selectively release the compound under conditions of varying acidity or alkalinity in the gastrointestinal tract. Alternatively, the matrix material or release retarding coating can take the form of an erodible polymer (e.g. a maleic anhydride polymer) which is substantially continuously eroded as the dosage form passes through the gastrointestinal tract. As a further alternative, the active compound can be formulated in a delivery system that provides osmotic control of the release of the compound. Osmotic release and other delayed release or sustained release formulations may be prepared in accordance with methods well known to those skilled in the art.<br>
Compositions for topical use include ointments, creams, sprays, patches, gels, liquid drops and inserts (for example intraocular inserts). Such compositions can be formulated in accordance with known methods.<br>
Compositions for parenteral administration are typically presented as sterile aqueous or oily solutions or fine suspensions, or may be provided in finely divided sterile powder form for making up extemporaneously with sterile water for injection.<br>
Examples of formulations for rectal or intra-vaginal administration include pessaries and suppositories which may be, for example, formed from a shaped moldable or waxy material containing the active compound.<br>
Compositions for administration by inhalation may take the form of inhalable powder compositions or liquid or powder sprays, and can be administrated in standard form using powder inhaler devices or aerosol dispensing devices. Such devices are well known. For administration by inhalation, the powdered formulations typically comprise the active compound together with an inert solid powdered diluent such as lactose.<br>
The compounds of the inventions will generally be presented in unit dosage form and, as such, will typically contain sufficient compound to provide a desired level of biological activity. For example, a formulation intended for oral administration may contain from 0.1 milligrams to 2 grams of active ingredient, more usually from 10 milligrams to 1 gram, for example, 50 milligrams to 500 milligrams.<br>
The active compound will be administered to a patient in need thereof (for example a human or animal patient) in an amount sufficient to achieve the desired therapeutic effect.<br>
Methods of Diagnosis and Treatment<br>
It is envisaged that the compounds of the formula (VII) will useful in the prophylaxis or treatment of a range of disease states or conditions mediated by cyclin dependent kinases, glycogen synthase kinase-3 and Aurora kinases. Examples of such disease states and conditions are set out above.<br>
Compounds of the formula (VII) are generally administered to a subject in need of such administration, for example a human or animal patient, preferably a human.<br>
The compounds will typically be administered in amounts that are therapeutically or prophylactically useful and which generally are non-toxic. However, in certain situations (for example in the case of life threatening diseases), the benefits of<br>
administering a compound of the formula (VII) may outweigh the disadvantages of any toxic effects or side effects, in which case it may be considered desirable to administer compounds in amounts that are associated with a degree of toxicity.<br>
The compounds may be administered over a prolonged term to maintain beneficial therapeutic effects or may be administered for a short period only. Alternatively they may be administered in a pulsatile or continuous manner.<br>
A typical daily dose of the compound can be in the range from 100 picograms to 100 milligrams per kilogram of body weight, more typically 10 nanograms to 10 milligrams per kilogram of bodyweight although higher or lower doses may be administered where required. Ultimately, the quantity of compound administered and the type of composition used will be commensurate with the nature of the disease or physiological condition being treated and will be at the discretion of the physician.<br>
The compounds of the formula (VII) can be administered as the sole therapeutic agent or they can be administered in combination therapy with one of more other compounds for treatment of a particular disease state, for example a neoplastic disease such as a cancer as hereinbefore defined. Examples of other therapeutic agents that may be administered together (whether concurrently or at different time intervals) with the compounds of the formula (VII) include but are not limited to topoisomerase inhibitors, alkylating agents, antimetabolites, DNA binders and microtubule inhibitors (tubulin targeting agents), such as cisplatin, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, irinotecan, fludarabine, 5FU, taxanes, mitomycin C, or radiotherapy. For the case of CDK or Aurora inhibitors combined with other therapies, the two or more treatments may be given in individually varying dose schedules and via different routes.<br>
Where the compound of the formula (VII) is administered in combination therapy with one, two, three, four or more other therapeutic agents (preferably one or two, preferably one), the compounds can be administered simultaneously or sequentially. When administered sequentially, they can be administered at closely spaced<br>
intervals (for example over a period of 5-10 minutes) or at longer intervals (for example 1, 2, 3,4 or more hours apart, or even longer periods apart where required), the precise dosage regimen being commensurate with the properties of the therapeutic agent(s).<br>
The compounds of the invention may also be administered in conjunction with non-chemotherapeutic treatments such as radiotherapy, photodynamic therapy, gene therapy; surgery and controlled diets.<br>
For use in combination therapy with another chemotherapeutic agent, the compound of the formula (VII) and one, two, three, four or more other therapeutic agents can be, for example, formulated together in a dosage form containing two, three, four or more therapeutic agents. In an alternative, the individual therapeutic agents may be formulated separately and presented together in the form of a kit, optionally with instructions for their use.<br>
A person skilled in the art would know through their common general knowledge the dosing regimes and combination therapies to use.<br>
Prior to administration of a compound of the formula (VII), a patient may be screened to determine whether a disease or condition from which the patient is or may be suffering is one which would be susceptible to treatment with a compound having activity against Aurora kinases. For example, a biological sample taken from a patient may be analysed to determine whether a condition or disease, such as cancer, that the patient is or may be suffering from is one which is characterised by upregulation of Aurora kinase, this includes elevated expression or over-expression of Aurora kinase, including gene amplification (i.e. multiple gene copies) and increased expression by a transcriptional effect, and hyperactivity and activation of Aurora kinase, including activation by mutations.. Thus, the patient may be subjected to a diagnostic test to detect a marker characteristic of over-expression, up-regulation or activation of Aurora kinase. The term diagnosis includes screening. By marker we include genetic markers including, for example, the measurement of DNA composition to identify mutations of Aurora or CDC4. The<br>
term marker also includes markers which are characteristic of up regulation of Aurora or cyclin E, including enzyme activity, enzyme levels, enzyme state (e.g. phosphorylated or not) and mRNA levels of the aforementioned proteins.<br>
The diagnostic tests are typically conducted on a biological sample selected from tumour biopsy samples, blood samples (isolation and enrichment of shed tumour cells), stool biopsies, sputum, chromosome analysis, pleural fluid, peritoneal fluid, or urine.<br>
It has been found, see Ewart-Toland et al., (Nat Genet. 2003 Aug;34(4):403-12), that individuals forming part of the sub-population possessing the Ile31 variant of the STK gene (the gene for Aurora kinase A) may have an increased susceptibility to certain forms of cancer. It is envisaged therefore that such individuals suffering from cancer will benefit from the administration of compounds having Aurora kinase inhibiting activity. A patient suffering from, or suspected of suffering from, a cancer may therefore be screened to determine whether he or she forms part of the Ile31 variant sub-population. The screening process will typically involve direct sequencing, oligonucleotide microarray analysis, or a mutant specific antibody.<br>
Tumours with activating mutants of Aurora or up-regulation of Aurora including any of the isoforms thereof, may be particularly sensitive to Aurora inhibitors. Tumours may preferentially be screened for up-regulation of Aurora or for Aurora possessing the Ile31 variant prior to treatment (Ewart-Toland et al., Nat Genet. 2003 Aug;34(4):403-12).   Ewart-Toland et al identified a common genetic variant in STK15 (resulting in the amino acid substitution F31I) that is preferentially amplified and associated with the degree of aneuploidy in human colon tumors. These results are consistent with an important role for the Ile31 variant of STK15 in human cancer susceptibility.<br>
The aurora A gene maps to the chromosome 20ql3 region that is frequently amplified in many cancers e.g. breast, bladder, colon, ovarian, pancreatic. Patients with a tumour that has this gene amplification might be particularly sensitive to reatments targeting aurora kinase inhibition<br>
Methods of identification and analysis of Aurora mutations and up-regulation of Aurora isoforms and chromosome 20ql3 amplification are known to a person skilled in the art. Screening methods could include, but are not limited to, standard methods such as reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or in-situ hybridisation.<br>
In screening by RT-PCR, the level of Aurora mRNA in the tumour is assessed by creating a cDNA copy of the mRNA followed by amplification of the cDNA by PCR. Methods of PCR amplification, the selection of primers, and conditions for amplification, are known to a person skilled in the art. Nucleic acid manipulations and PCR are carried out by standard methods, as described for example in Ausubel, F.M. et al., eds. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, 2004, John Wiley &amp; Sons Inc., or Innis, M.A. et-al., eds. PCR Protocols: a guide to methods and applications, 1990, Academic Press, San Diego. Reactions and manipulations involving nucleic acid techniques are also described in Sambrook et al., 2001, 3rd Ed, Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press. Alternatively a commercially available kit for RT-PCR (for example Roche Molecular Biochemicals) may be used, or methodology as set forth in United States patents 4,666,828; 4,683,202; 4,801,531; 5,192,659, 5,272,057, 5,882,864, and 6,218,529 and incorporated herein by reference.<br>
An example of an in-situ hybridisation technique for assessing Aurora mRNA expression would be fluorescence in-situ hybridisation (FISH) (see Angerer, 1987 Meth. Enzymol., 152: 649).<br>
Generally, in situ hybridization comprises the following major steps: (1) fixation of tissue to be analyzed; (2) prehybridization treatment of the sample to increase accessibility of target nucleic acid, and to reduce nonspecific binding; (3) hybridization of the mixture of nucleic acids to the nucleic acid in the biological structure or tissue; (4) post-hybridization washes to remove nucleic acid fragments not bound in the hybridization, and (5) detection of the hybridized nucleic acid fragments. The probes used in such applications are typically labeled, for example, with radioisotopes or fluorescent reporters. Preferred probes are sufficiently long,<br>
for example, from about 50,100, or 200 nucleotides to about 1000 or more nucleotides, to enable specific hybridization with the target nucleic acid(s) under stringent conditions. Standard methods for carrying out FISH are described in Ausubel, F.M. et al., eds. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, 2004, John Wiley &amp; Sons Inc and Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization: Technical Overview by John M. S. Bartlett in Molecular Diagnosis of Cancer, Methods and Protocols, 2nd ed.; ISBN: 1-59259-760-2; March 2004, pps. 077-088; Series: Methods in Molecular Medicine.<br>
Alternatively, the protein products expressed from the mRNAs may be assayed by immunohistochemistry of tumour samples, solid phase immunoassay with microtiter plates, Western blotting, 2-dimensional SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, ELISA, flow cytometry and other methods known in the art for detection of specific proteins. Detection methods would include the use of site specific antibodies. The skilled artisan will recognize that all such well-known techniques for detection of Aurora up-regulation and mutants of Aurora could be applicable in the present case.<br>
In addition, all of these techniques could also be used to identify tumours particularly suitable for treatment with CDK inhibitors. Tumours with mutants of CDC4 or up-regulation, in particular over-expression, of cyclin E or loss of p21 or p27 may be particularly sensitive to CDK inhibitors. Tumours may preferentially be screened for up-regulation, in particular over-expression, of cyclin E (Harwell RM, Mull BB, Porter DC, Keyomarsi K.; J Biol Chem. 2004 Mar 26;279(13):12695-705) or loss of p21 or p27 or for CDC4 variants prior to treatment (Rajagopalan H, Jallepalli PV, Rago C, Velculescu VE, Kinzler KW, Vogelstein B, Lengauer C; Nature. 2004 Mar 4;428(6978):77-81).<br>
Antifungal Use<br>
In a further aspect, the invention provides the use of the compounds of the formula (VII) as hereinbefore defined as antifungal agents.<br>
The compounds of the formula (VII) may be used in animal medicine (for example in the treatment of mammals such as humans), or in the treatment of plants (e.g. in agriculture and horticulture), or as general antifungal agents, for example as preservatives and disinfectants.<br>
In one embodiment, the invention provides a compound of the formula (VII) as hereinbefore defined for use in the prophylaxis or treatment of a fungal infection in a mammal such as a human.<br>
Also provided is the use of a compound of the formula (VII) for the manufacture of a medicament for use in the prophylaxis or treatment of a fungal infection in a mammal such as a human.<br>
For example, compounds of the invention may be administered to human patients suffering from, or at risk of infection by, topical fungal infections caused by among other organisms, species of Candida, Trichophyton, Microsporum or Epidermophyton, or in mucosal infections caused by Candida albicans (e.g. thrush and vaginal candidiasis). The compounds of the invention can also be administered for the treatment or prophylaxis of systemic fungal infections caused by, for example, Candida albicans, Cryptococcus neoformans, Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus fumigatus, Coccidiodies, Paracoccidioides, Histoplasma or Blastomyces.<br>
In another aspect, the invention provides an antifungal composition for agricultural (including horticultural) use, comprising a compound of the formula (VII) together with an agriculturally acceptable diluent or carrier.<br>
The invention further provides a method of treating an animal (including a mammal such as a human), plant or seed having a fungal infection, which comprises treating said animal, plant or seed, or the locus of said plant or seed, with an effective amount of a compound of the formula (VII).<br>
The invention also provides a method of treating a fungal infection in a plant or seed which comprises treating the plant or seed with an antifungally effective<br>
amount of a fungicidal composition containing a compound of the formula (VII) as hereinbefore defined.<br>
Differential screening assays may be used to select for those compounds of the present invention with specificity for non-human CDK enzymes. Compounds which act specifically on the CDK enzymes of eukaryotic pathogens can be used as antifungal or anti-parasitic agents. Inhibitors of the Candida CDK kinase, CKSI, can be used in the treatment of candidiasis. Antifungal agents can be used against infections of the type hereinbefore defined, or opportunistic infections that commonly occur in debilitated and immunosuppressed patients such as patients with leukemias and lymphomas, people who are receiving immunosuppressive therapy, and patients with predisposing conditions such as diabetes mellitus or AIDS, as well as for non-immunosuppressed patients.<br>
Assays described in the art can be used to screen for agents which may be useful for inhibiting at least one fungus implicated in mycosis such as candidiasis, aspergillosis, mucormycosis, blastomycosis, geotrichosis, cryptococcosis, chromoblastomycosis, coccidiodomycosis, conidiosporosis, histoplasmosis, maduromycosis, rhinosporidosis, nocaidiosis, para-actinomycosis, penicilliosis, monoliasis, or sporotrichosis. The differential screening assays can be used to identify anti-fungal agents which may have therapeutic value in the treatment of aspergillosis by making use of the CDK genes cloned from yeast such as Aspergillus fumigatus, Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus nidulans, or Aspergillus terreus, or where the mycotic infection is mucon-nycosis, the CDK assay can be derived from yeast such as Rhizopus arrhizus, Rhizopus oryzae, Absidia corymbifera, Absidia ramosa, or Mucorpusillus. Sources of other CDK enzymes include the pathogen Pneumocystis carinii.<br>
By way of example, in vitro evaluation of the antifungal activity of the compounds can be performed by determining the minimum inhibitory concentration (M.I.C.) which is the lowest concentration of the test compounds, in a suitable medium, at which growth of the particular microorganism fails to occur. In practice, a series of agar plates, each having the test compound incorporated at a particular<br>
concentration is inoculated with a standard culture of, for example, Candida albicans and each plate is then incubated for an appropriate period at 37 °C. The plates are then examined for the presence or absence of growth of the fungus and the appropriate M.I.C. value is noted. Alternatively, a turbidity assay in liquid cultures can be performed and a protocol outlining an example of this assay can be found in Example 314.<br>
The in vivo evaluation of the compounds can be carried out at a series of dose levels by intraperitoneal or intravenous injection or by oral administration, to mice that have been inoculated with a fungus, e.g., a strain of Candida albicans or Aspergillus flavus. The activity of the compounds can be assessed by monitoring the growth of the fungal infection in groups of treated and untreated mice (by histology or by retrieving fungi from the infection). The activity may be measured in terms of the dose level at which the compound provides 50% protection against the lethal effect of the infection (PD50).<br>
For human antifungal use, the compounds of the formula (VII) can be administered alone or in admixture with a pharmaceutical carrier selected in accordance with the intended route of administration and standard pharmaceutical practice. Thus, for example, they may be administered orally, parenterally, intravenously, intramuscularly or subcutaneously by means of the formulations described above in the section headed "Pharmaceutical Formulations".<br>
For oral and parenteral administration to human patients, the daily dosage level of the antifungal compounds of the formula (VII) can be from 0.01 to 10 mg/kg (in divided doses), depending on inter alia the potency of the compounds when administered by either the oral or parenteral route. Tablets or capsules of the compounds may contain, for example, from 5 mg to 0.5 g of active compound for administration singly or two or more at a time as appropriate. The physician in any event will determine the actual dosage (effective amount) which will be most suitable for an individual patient and it will vary with the age, weight and response of the particular patient.<br>
Alternatively, the antifungal compounds of formula (VII) can be administered in the form of a suppository or pessary, or they may be applied topically in the form of a lotion, solution, cream, ointment or dusting powder. For example, they can be incorporated into a cream consisting of an aqueous emulsion of polyethylene glycols or liquid paraffin; or they can be incorporated, at a concentration between 1 and 10%, into an ointment consisting of a white wax or white soft paraffin base together with such stabilizers and preservatives as may be required.<br>
In addition to the therapeutic uses described above, anti-fungal agents developed with such differential screening assays can be used, for example, as preservatives in foodstuff, feed supplement for promoting weight gain in livestock, or in disinfectant formulations for treatment of non-living matter, e.g., for decontaminating hospital equipment and rooms. In similar fashion, side by side comparison of inhibition of a mammalian CDK and an insect CDK, such as the Drosophilia CDK5 gene (Hellmich et al. (1994) FEBS Lett 356:317-21), will permit selection amongst the compounds herein of inhibitors which discriminate between the human/mammalian and insect enzymes. Accordingly, the present invention expressly contemplates the use and formulation of the compounds of the invention in insecticides, such as for use in management of insects like the fruit fly.<br>
In yet another embodiment, certain of the subject CDK inhibitors can be selected on the basis of inhibitory specificity for plant CDK's relative to the mammalian enzyme. For example, a plant CDK can be disposed in a differential screen with one or more of the human enzymes to select those compounds of greatest selectivity for inhibiting the plant enzyme. Thus, the present invention specifically contemplates formulations of the subject CDK inhibitors for agricultural applications, such as in the form of a defoliant or the like.<br>
For agricultural and horticultural purposes the compounds of the invention may be used in the form of a composition formulated as appropriate to the particular use and intended purpose. Thus the compounds may be applied in the form of dusting powders, or granules, seed dressings, aqueous solutions, dispersions or emulsions, dips, sprays, aerosols or smokes. Compositions may also be supplied in the form of<br>
dispersible powders, granules or grains, or concentrates for dilution prior to use. Such compositions may contain such conventional carriers, diluents or adjuvants as are known and acceptable in agriculture and horticulture and they can be manufactured in accordance with conventional procedures. The compositions may also incorporate other active ingredients, for example, compounds having herbicidal or insecticidal activity or a further fungicide. The compounds and compositions can be applied in a number of ways, for example they can be applied directly to the plant foliage, stems, branches, seeds or roots or to the soil or other growing medium, and they may be used not only to eradicate disease, but also prophylactically to protect the plants or seeds from attack. By way of example, the compositions may contain from 0.01 to 1 wt.% of the active ingredient. For field use, likely application rates of the active ingredient may be from 50 to 5000 g/hectare.<br>
The invention also contemplates the use of the compounds of the formula (VII) in the control of wood decaying fungi and in the treatment of soil where plants grow, paddy fields for seedlings, or water for perfusion. Also contemplated by the invention is the use of the compounds of the formula (VII) to protect stored grain and other non-plant loci from fungal infestation.<br>

•	Methods:<br>
Prior to using preparative chromatography to isolate and purify the product compounds, analytical LC-MS can first be used to determine the most appropriate conditions for preparative chromatography. A typical routine is to run an analytical LC-MS using the type of chromatography (low or high pH) most suited for compound structure. Once the analytical trace shows good chromatography, a suitable preparative method of the same type can be chosen. Typical running condition for both low and high pH chromatography methods are:<br>
Flow rate: 24 ml/min<br>
Gradient: Generally all gradients have an initial 0.4 min step with 95% A + 5% B. Then according to analytical trace a 3.6 min gradient is chosen in order to achieve good separation (e.g. from 5% to 50% B for early retaining compounds; from 35% to 80% B for middle retaining compounds and so on)<br>
Wash: 1 minute wash step is performed at the end of the gradient<br>
Re-equilibration: A 2.1 minute re-equilibration step is carried out to prepare the system for the next run<br>
Make Up flow rate: 1 ml/min<br>

Protocol A<br>
1.7 ul of active CDK2/CyclinA (Upstate Biotechnology, 10U/µl) is diluted in assay buffer (250ul of 10X strength assay buffer (200mM MOPS pH 7.2,250mM p-glycerophosphate, 50mM EDTA, 150mM MgCl2), 11.27 µl l0mM ATP, 2.5 µl IM DTT, 25 µl l00mM sodium orthovanadate, 708.53 µl H2O), and 10 µl mixed with 10 µl of histone substrate mix (60 µl bovine histone H1 (Upstate Biotechnology, 5 mg/ml), 940 µl H2O, 35 µCi 33P-ATP) and added to 96 well plates along with 5 µl of various dilutions of the test compound in DMSO (up to<br>
2.5%). The reaction is allowed to proceed for 5 hours before being stopped with an excess of ortho-phosphoric acid (30 ul at 2%).<br>
33P-ATP which remains unincorporated into the histone H1 is separated from phosphorylated histone H1 on a Millipore MAPH filter plate. The wells of the MAPH plate are wetted with 0.5% orthophosphoric acid, and then the results of the reaction are filtered with a Millipore vacuum filtration unit through the wells. Following filtration, the residue is washed twice with 200 µl of 0.5% orthophosphoric acid. Once the filters have dried, 25 ul of Microscint 20 scintillant is added, and then counted on a Packard Topcount for 30 seconds.<br>
The % inhibition of the CDK2 activity is calculated and plotted in order to determine the concentration of test compound required to inhibit 50% of the CDK2 activity (IC50).<br>
The compounds of Examples 0 to 5 each have IC50 values of less than 20uM or provide at least 50% inhibition of the CDK2 activity at a concentration of l0µM. Preferred compounds have IC50 values of less than 1 µM.<br>

Anti-proliferative Activity<br>
The anti-proliferative activities of compounds of the invention were determined by measuring the ability of the compounds to inhibition of cell growth in a number of cell lines. Inhibition of cell growth was measured using the Alamar Blue assay (Nociari, M. M, Shalev, A., Benias, P., Russo, C. Journal of Immunological Methods 1998,213,157-167). The method is based on the ability of viable cells to reduce resazurin to its fluorescent product resorufin. For each proliferation assay cells were plated onto 96 well plates and allowed to recover for 16 hours prior to the addition of inhibitor compounds for a further 72 hours. At the end of the incubation period 10% (v/v) Alamar Blue was added and incubated for a further 6 hours prior to determination of fluorescent product at 535nM ex / 590nM em.
