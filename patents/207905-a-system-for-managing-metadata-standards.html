COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
(See section 10, rule 13)<br>
"A system for managing metadata standards"<br>
SchemaLogic, Inc., an American company of 16300 Redmond Way, Suite 202, Redmond, Washington 98052-4482, United States of America.<br>
GRANTED<br>
23-1-2007<br><br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Attempts to access and share information across disparate systems are limited by inconsistent organizational naming and data standards. It is very difficult to have a collaborative software infrastructure to create information access and sharing standards across existing systems by managing disparate taxonomies and metadata models.<br>
Many technologies have tried to solve basic information integration problems, but have not had great success. Deployments of integration technologies have not measured up to their intended return in part because the technology relies on organizational standards to be well adopted and assumes that naming standards are unchanging.<br>
In reality, standards rarely exist, have limited adoption, and are subject to change. What is needed is a way to solve the problem of creating and mamtaining disparate systems using schema objects that are easily manipulated by users.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
Briefly described, a schema model allows objects to be contextualized by using stored values that are used to localize the object. The values used for localizing each object that is to be localized are stored in a container class element that is associated with the object that is to be localized. The object having localized term values stored in a container class element is related to another object wherein the objects are related using one of a hierarchical term and an entry term relationship. The associated values allow a user to override by redefinition default<br><br>
values presented by a controlled vocabulary system. The user can further relate term objects by using hierarchical term, entry term, and related-term relationships. This arrangement allows users and systems to more effectively re-use standard data definitions.<br>
Statement of Invention<br>
Accordingly, the present invention relates to a system for managing metadata standards, comprising a reference data manager that is arranged to manage common reference data entities that comprise metadata definitions; a data structural definition metadata manager that is arranged to, in response to the metadata definitions, generate independent structural data that comprise implementation-independent metadata definitions, wherein the implementation-independent metadata definitions are in a format that is capable of being expressed in an arbitrary language; and an interface object that is arranged to control processes that edit the metadata definitions and to control processes that edit the independent structural data.<br>

Definition of Terms<br>
Table 1 includes definitions for terms related to the present invention.<br><br>
Table 1<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
Exemplary Operating Environment<br>
FIGURES 1-3 show components of an exemplary environment in which the invention may be practiced. Not all of the components may be required to practice the invention, and variations in the arrangement and type of the components may be made without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention.<br>
FIGURE 1 shows a plurality of local area networks ("LANs") 120 and wide area network ("WAN") 130 interconnected by routers 110. On a single network linking many computers through a mesh of possible connections, a router receives transmitted messages and forwards them to their correct destinations over available routes. On an interconnected set of LANs-including those based on differing architectures and protocols-a router acts as a link between LANs, enabling messages to be sent from one to another. Communication links within LANs typically include twisted pair, fiber optics, or coaxial cable, while communication links between networks may utilize analog telephone lines, full or fractional dedicated digital lines including Tl, T2, T3, and T4, Integrated Services Digital Networks (ISDNs), Digital Subscriber Lines (DSLs), wireless links, or other communications links known to those skilled in the art. Furthermore, computers, such as remote computer 140, and other related electronic devices can be remotely connected to either LANs 120 or WAN 130 via a modem and temporary telephone link. The number of WANs, LANs, and routers in FIGURE 1 may be increased or decreased arbitrarily without departing from the spirit or scope of this invention.<br>
The media used to transmit information in communication links illustrates one type of computer-readable media, namely communication media. Generally, computer-readable media includes any media that can be accessed by a computing device. Computer-readable media may include computer storage media, communication media, or any combination thereof.<br>
Communication media typically embodies computer-readable instructions, data structures, program modules, or other data in a modulated data signal such as a carrier wave or other transport mechanism and includes any information delivery media. The term "modulated data signal" means a signal that has one or more of its characteristics set or changed in such a manner as to encode information in the signal. By way of example, communication media includes wired<br><br>
media such as twisted pair, coaxial cable, fiber optics, wave guides, and other wired media and wireless media such as acoustic, RF, infrared, and other wireless media,<br>
A server, such as the server shown in FIGURE 2, may provide a WWW site, be a content server, a schema server, an authentication server, etc.<br>
FIGURE 2 shows an exemplary server in accordance with aspects of the invention. Server 200 may include many more components than those shown in FIGURE 2. As shown in FIGURE 2, server 200 is connected to WAN/LAN 100, or other communications network, via network interface unit 210. Network interface unit 210 includes the necessary circuitry for connecting server 200 to WAN/LAN 100, and is constructed for use with various communication protocols including the TCP/IP protocol. Typically, network interface unit 210 is a card contained within server 200.<br>
Server 200 also includes processing unit 212, video display adapter 214, and a mass memory, all connected via bus 222. The mass memory generally includes random access memory ("RAM") 216, read-only memory ("ROM") 232, and one or more permanent mass storage devices, such as hard disk drive 228, a tape drive (not shown), optical drive 226, such as a CD-ROM/DVD-ROM drive, and/or a floppy disk drive (not shown). The mass memory stores operating system 220 for controlling the operation of server 200. This component may comprise a general purpose server operating system as is known to those of ordinary skill in the art, such as UNIX, LINUX™, or Microsoft WINDOWS NT®. Basic input/output system ("BIOS") 218 is also provided for controlling the low-level operation of server 200.<br>
The mass memory as described above illustrates another type of computer-readable media, namely computer storage media. Computer storage media may include volatile and nonvolatile, removable and non-removable media implemented in any method or technology for storage of information, such as computer readable instructions, data structures, program modules or other data. Examples of computer storage media include RAM, ROM, EEPROM, flash memory or other memory technology, CD-ROM, digital versatile disks (DVD) or other optical storage, magnetic cassettes, magnetic tape, magnetic disk storage or other magnetic storage devices, or any other medium which can be used to store the desired information and which can be accessed by a computing device.<br><br>
The mass memory may also store program code and data for providing a WWW site. More specifically, the mass memory may store applications including server application program 230, and programs 234,<br>
Server 200 also comprises input/output interface 224 for communicating with external devices, such as a mouse, keyboard, scanner, or other input devices not shown in FIGURE 2. Likewise, server 200 may further comprise additional mass storage facilities such as optical drive 226 and hard disk drive 228, Hard disk drive 228 is utilized by server 200 to store, among other things, application programs, databases, and program data used by server application program 230. For example, schemas, customer databases, product databases, image databases, and relational databases may be stored.<br>
FIGURE 3 depicts several components of client computer 300. Client computer 300 may include many more components than those shown in FIGURE 3. However, it is not necessary that those conventional components be shown in order to disclose an illustrative embodiment for practicing the present invention. As shown in FIGURE 3, client computer 300 includes network interface unit 302 for connecting to a LAN or WAN, or for connecting remotely to a LAN or WAN. Network interface unit 302 includes the necessary circuitry for such a connection, and is also constructed for use with various communication protocols including the TCP/IP protocol, the particular network configuration of the LAN or WAN it is connecting to, and a particular type of coupling medium. Network interface unit 302 may also be capable of connecting to the Internet through a point-to-point protocol ("PPP") connection or a serial line Internet protocol ("SLIP") connection as known to those skilled in the art.<br>
Client computer 300 also includes BIOS 326, processing unit 306, video display adapter 308, and memory. The memory generally includes RAM 310, ROM 304, and a permanent mass storage device, such as a disk drive. The memory stores operating system 312 and programs 334 for controlling the operation of client computer 300. The memory also includes WWW browser 314, such as Netscape's NAVIGATOR® or Microsoft's INTERNET EXPLORER® browsers, for accessing the WWW. It will be appreciated that these components may be stored on a computer-readable medium and loaded into memory of client computer 300 using a drive mechanism associated with the computer-readable medium, such as a floppy<br><br>
disk drive (not shown), optical drive 316, such as a CD-ROM/DVD-ROM drive, and/or hard disk drive 318, Input/output interface 320 may also be provided for receiving input from a mouse, keyboard, or other input device. The memory, network interface unit 302, video display adapter 308, and input/output interface 320 are all connected to processing unit 306 via bus 322. Other peripherals may also be connected to processing unit 306 in a similar manner.<br>
As will be recognized from the discussion below, aspects of the invention may be embodied on server 200, on client computer 300, or on some combination thereof. For example, programming steps may be contained in programs 334 and/or programs 234.<br>
In this disclosure, references will be made to client and server. Where appropriate, client should be construed to refer to a process or set of processes that execute on one or more electronic device, such as client computer 300 of FIGURE 3. A client is not limited, however, to running on a client computer. It may also run on a server, such as server 200 or be distributed among various electronic devices, wherein each device might contain one or more processes or routines that together constitute a client application. Where appropriate, client should be construed, in addition or in lieu of the discussion above, to be a device upon which one or more client processes execute, for example, client computer 300 or server 200.<br>
Similarly, server should be construed to refer to a process or set of processes that execute on one or more electronic devices, such as server 200. like a client, a server is not limited to running on a server computer. Rather, it may also execute on what would typically be considered a client computer, such as client computer 300 of FIGURE 3, or be distributed among various electronic devices, wherein each device might contain one or more processes or routines that together constitute a server application. Where appropriate, server should be construed, in addition or in lieu of the discussion above, to be a device upon which one or more server processes execute, for example, server 200 or client computer 300.<br>
Overview<br>
The object model in accordance with the present invention provides specific objects that can be used to model schemas for applications such as database<br><br>
or enterprise applications, The schemas may also be system independent, such as the structure of a web form, a search UI (user interface), or tagging screen. In fact, the same "schema" may exist in multiple systems or instantiations.<br>
Large organizations, both private and public, often have many different enterprise applications. These may include content management systems (CMS), customer relationship management systems (CRM), or proprietary systems developed in house. The value of these applications is their ability to collect, store, manage, and retrieve information. Even when these applications have been designed and implemented well most organizations are finding that in order to truly take advantage of the information already collected, they need to be able to share the information between systems. For example, the information in a CRM system is typically far more valuable when it can be used in conjunction with a CMS. In this situation a company can better take advantage of its information assets by using the material in the CMS by targeting appropriate information to individual customers.<br>
This situation can be clearly seen in the example of a merger between two companies or government agencies. In this typical situation, information might only be valuable when it is consolidated or understood as a whole.<br>
The general problem at hand is the problem of sharing, managing, and using data from disparate systems. This problem may take many different forms, but in each incarnation the issues of data compatibility, maintenance of data standards, impact analysis, and propagation of schema standards are usually implicated.<br>
An object model in accordance with the present invention provides a set of tools, which allows users to:<br>
•	Define re-usable data types (Element obj ects) so they can be used across many different systems.<br>
•	Create collections of these elements, (Content Class objects), which describe different structural or logical concepts; systems, forms, or reports, for example.<br>
•	Create and model simple to sophisticated vocabulary or thesaurus structures (Vocabulary, Term, Term Relationship objects).<br>
•	Create different versions of these schemas which maintain the data description but which also allow for idiosyncratic difference between systems. This allows for representing labels or values differently depending the context, whether that<br><br>
context be a language or a computer system, (Class Element, Vocabulary View objects).<br>
o   Create extensive and robust localization of element values and vocabulary terms (Element Value, Term Value objects).     Determine the impact to different systems or users of any change to the schemas o   Customize the change management process per object (Contract Object). •    Propagate the schemas to target systems.<br>
By providing functionality that supports the items listed above, the object model in accordance with the present invention provides a solution to the problem faced by many large organizations. The object model provides flexibility that is apparent in both the schema modeling the object model supports and the ability of the object model mat allows for associating context specific information to schema objects.<br>
In particular, Table 2 below describes an object motlel that provides the following objects that allow for the associating of context specific information to other schema objects:<br>
Table 2<br><br><br><br>
The object model as a whole provides for the modeling of a centralized collection of schema objects, which can allow organizations to more effectively describe their electronic information. The five objects listed above provide the ability to specifically associate context dependent information to the schema definitions. This allows organizations to more effectively share and re-use schema objects across multiple systems<br>
Object Relationship Notation<br>
Table 3 describes common types of relationships between objects:<br>
Table 3<br><br>
Schema Object Model<br>
FIGURE 4 is a schematic diagram of an example Schema Server Object Model, in accordance with the present invention. Schema Object is a super-<br><br>
class of five major Schema Server conceptual objects: Content Class, Element Type. Vocabulary, Term and VocabularyView, All of these objects have their own specific semantics, but share the common characteristics of being Schema Objects:<br>
•	They have a direct impact on the substance of an abstract Schema Definition;<br>
•	They can be owned;<br>
•    They are involved in impact analysis, both as starting points of impacts and as impacted objects;<br>
•	Their workflow processes can be tracked and logged.<br>
The properties of this object support the administrative tasks of modeling, managing and propagating schemas. Table 4 lists example properties of the object model:<br>
Table 4<br><br><br><br>
Additionally Schema Objects can be associated with permissions, contracts, changes, and incidents. For example, a Schema Object may have zevo-or-more permissions against it. (See "Permission" object described below.) This is a typically a navigable relationship. The list of permissions against any given Schema Object may be extracted from the system.<br>
A Schema Object may have one optional Contract. The Contract specifies certain parameters for the Change Management process that is initiated when this Schema Object is involved in a data modifying operation (Add, Update, Delete, Move). If a change is made to a Schema Object that does not have a contract directly associated with it, "Contract Negotiation" logic is invoked to identify the most relevant contract to be used according to special impact analysis logic specified elsewhere. (See "Contract" object below.)<br>
A Schema Object may have one optional Change associated with it at any time. The associated Change object represents the current or most recent change transaction against the associated Schema Object and tracks the change state information. The Change object may also store certain Contract conditions as of the initiation of the change process to ensure that subsequent changes to the Contract do not undesirably impact the Change rules.<br>
Incident objects typically track every API transaction against a Schema Object. A Schema Object may have zero-or-more incidents associated with it. Incidents can be purged or rolled out of the online system to reduce system bulk if necessary. The system administrator may optionally maintain a complete log of all incidents for all schema objects.<br>
Content Class<br>
Content Classes can be used to abstractly represent virtually any aggregate structure definition. Content Class objects are a sub-class of Schema Object. As such, all properties and relationships of Schema Object typically apply to Content Class. Content Classes are, simply, lists of Element Type references. Each reference to an externally defined Element Type definition usually includes optional overriding properties that contextualize the reference in such a way as to<br><br>
refine, restrict or recast without violating the underlying definition or compromise mapability of the Schema Object,<br>
Optionally, a Content Class may be defined as "ereatable" which corresponds to the inverse of the conventional Object Oriented concept of "abstract," which indicates whether the structure definition is (or is not) intended for instantiation, or intended as a conceptual building block for other inherited or aggregating complex structures (such as child content classes or other aggregate content classes). Additionally, a Content Class may be defined as an "option list" indicating that of the referenced Element Types, only one may appear in any instantiation.<br>
Content Class objects are used to define abstract data structure definitions as aggregations of Element Type references. These may be used to describe actual database schemas, Web Forms, Search Interfaces, other data definitions, and the like.<br>
Content Class objects are also subject to class inheritance. For example, each Content class other than the root class has one parent. Each content class inherits the elements associated its ancestors. To describe non-essential idiosyncrasies of elements some of the properties of an element can be overridden. (See the Class Element object below).<br>
The grant of "owner" permission to a class implicitly grants "owner" permission to its sub-classes. This permission grants the ability to add, update and delete any of these Content Classes (within the constraints of change control collaboration) and grants the permission to grant permissions on these Schema Object to other users.<br>
Impact analysis evaluation flows from a class toward its descendent classes (leaf nodes). If a change is made to an Element Type referenced by a Class CI, the descendent classes of CI can be considered impacted. Any users with permissions to any descendent classes can be considered impacted and receive votes on the Change process.<br>
Contract negotiation logic typically flows from an impacted Content Class toward the root of the Content Class tree. If, within an individual impact analysis graph, multiple Content Classes are individually impacted by outside Element Type references, the common parent of directly impacted Content Classes<br><br><br>
is assessed. The contract in force is evaluated as the contract associated with the class closest to the common parent Content Class.<br>
Example properties of Content Class objects are shown in Table 5:<br><br>
Content Classes may have one or more elements associated with them. Elements can be either directly associated with the content class, or inherited from parent content classes. Each relationship between a Content Class and Element Type can be qualified by a Class Element object that provides contextual properties that either override or otherwise alter the interpretation or rules for use of the Element Type definition.<br>
In accordance with the present invention, a Schema Server typically does not support explicit embedding definitions of sub-elements within the scope of the encompassing structure (in this case Content Class). The sub-element definitions are typically drawn from a globally visible set of Element Type definitions. The value of this approach for applications is to encourage global visibility and maximize reuse of definitions, while providing for local contextualization. Local scope definition of Elements (or Attributes) typically trades off manageability for convenience.<br><br><br>
All Content Classes other than the built-in root class typically have one parent Content Class, This relationship defines the class inheritance mechanism. Consequently all Content Classes can be organized as a single-inheritance tree.<br>
Element Type<br>
Element Type objects define reusable data component definitions that control or represent corresponding structures in one or more client systems and, as such, are a central part of schema modeling. Element Type objects are flexible objects that represent a set of concepts that are often considered discrete structures by some models (e.g., both XML Elements and Attributes can be modeled as Element Types). Table 6 defines mapping concepts within typical disciplines or models:<br>
Table 6<br><br>
The value of the model and its emphasis on collaboration, mapping and management typically depends explicitly on the generality of the modeling concepts such as Element Type. This generality allows the most liberal technical and conceptual mapping across disparate models.<br>
Element Types commonly define simple, "scalar" data type definitions such as 'Title", "Author", "PurchaseQuantity", "SKU", "DueDate" or "FlowRate" that are expressible as single values of common data types such as integer, string, date-time or floating-point number.<br>
Some Element Types represent a Content Class for purposes of composition within another Content Class. Element Types specify a variety of properties and relationships that Content Classes do not such as cardinality rules,<br><br>
Display Labels etc. Use of "class-Type" Element Types generally simplifies the modeling of complex Content Class structures.<br>
Vocabulary-type Element Types model, in an implementation-independent way, a wide range of requirements where an Element Type may only contain a value from a well defined and intentionally controlled list of values.<br>
In some cases, it may be desirable to define Element Types that are abstracted prototypes for other more concrete Element Type definitions. For example an Element Type may be called "URLType" and define the basic data, semantic and syntactic rules for representation of an URL including the regular expression rules for an W3C URL string. Other Element Types (e.g: "ImageURL") may refer to "URLType" as the basis for their definition rather than the primitive data type "string." This facilitates centralized definition of certain data rules and definitions and enhances understandability and manageability.<br>
Table 7 describes various properties that are associated with Element<br>
Type:<br><br>
Table 7<br><br><br>
ValidPattem	Stiing	specification mechanism that can be standardized within any organization to store and distribute validation rule specifications.<br>
The Valid Rule/Valid Pattern field pair may be used to store organizationally standardized cross-platform validation specifications or platform-specific specifications, in cases where the specific technology of the primary consuming systems of the Element definition are known. See example below.<br>
DefaultValue	String	The default value for the element. Default value is an un-validated string and it is the responsibility of the schema editor to enter a valid value.<br>
Default value is valid for only the "simple scalar" data types and is not displayed for Class-type or Vocabulary-type Element definitions.<br>
Examples of valid rules and patterns are shown in Table 8:<br>
Table 8<br><br>
Object definitions in this model are used to associate concepts with Element Types. Conventional modeling systems that aspire to provide an overarching modeling system such as UML include a similar concept, called "Property." Also Data Dictionaries or Repositories also frequently provide for a common catalog of data definitions.<br>
In accordance with the present invention, use of a globally unique identifier as the primary identifier of Element Types provides for bridging namespaces more effectively. Use of globally unique identifiers enables effective element re-use across systems as well as supporting the notion of class elements. Provision of unique human readable names allows decision makers to identify and discuss objects of interest within the context of collaboration. Combining Element<br><br>
and Attribute definitions (in the case of modeling XML structures) helps to clarify the actual unity of the conceptual space and simplifies management and mapping into other data modeling domains (e.g., relational domains). Defining default cardinality properties (minoccurs, maxoccurs) in the Element Type definition provides (non-binding) guidelines for usage.<br>
Generalized Valid Rule / Valid Pattern mechanism for defining data validation mechanism, provides for both a centralized definition of these rules, open extensibility while not binding to a particular technical implementation of these rules. Identification of a validating set of values (Vocabulary-type Element Type) is done by reference to an external definition and not embedded within the Element Type definition itself. This provides for multiple Element Types sharing the same or variant views of the same domain (e.g., Geography).<br>
Element Types include not only machine-readable definitions of data type but human-readable definitions, for management and for-multi-lingual end-user representation (labels and descriptions), in forms and reports. Centralized management of end-user human readable labels and definitions enhances consistent use and understandability of shared information. Manageability through a common namespace, searchability, permissions, bi-directionally navigable relationships and intrinsic change management substantially enhance lifecycle usefulness and reusability of Element Type definitions over conventional approaches.<br>
An Element Type can optionally have a one-to-one (1-1) relationship with a Vocabulary. If an Element Type is of type Vocabulary, it may be associated with one Vocabulary. Vocabularies provide a list of allowed values mat define the scope of legal values to be assigned to the Element.<br>
Association of the Vocabulary with the Element Type by reference allows the same Vocabulary Domain to be utilized by multiple Element Types for different purposes (See Vocabulary View below). Element Types define not only a data definition but also can define a semantic use purpose. If the Vocabulary has one or more vocabulary views associated with it, then a vocabulary view may also be associated with the element.<br>
The Vocabulary View mechanism provides a useful mechanism to form a subset of a larger vocabulary for specialized purposes. For example, a list of product categories from a products vocabulary including 5000 separate terms is<br><br><br>
required for the Element Type "ProductCategory,"  The Vocabulary "Products" Element Type is specified and the Vocabulary View "AllProductCategori.es" Element Type is further specified to restrict the values to the desired subset for this application.<br>
Element Types may be referenced by zero-or-more Content Classes. In a well-designed system many Element Types can be shared by many Content Classes. This sharing of Element Types encourages data homogeneity, data sharing, and data re-use across systems and is an important part of centralizing the schema modeling process as this is where the elements can be "re-used."<br>
Conventional relational database systems can reference Column definitions from a common system table but the Element Types cannot be referenced by multiple tables. Other Relational systems (PICK) could allow use of a common set of data definitions but typically are limited to non-data defining structures (called symbolics).<br>
In accordance with the present invention, use of a common Element Type definition by multiple systems and structures, is not typically supported by Relational systems (and is poorly supported by UML and XML definitions), particularly with regards to lack of bidirectional navigability and manageability. Impact analysis is not easily accomplished. Embedding of Element, Attribute or property definitions inhibits reuse. The example object model emphasizes and enforces the mechanism of central definition with unique identifiers and bidirectional relationships to provide an optimal condition for Element Type reuse. All relationships to Content Classes can be qualified by Class Element objects to condition and qualify the application of the Element Type.<br>
Vocabularies<br>
Vocabularies provide a flexible mechanism for describing sets of approved tagging values for Elements. Vocabularies can be, for example, simple lists of terms or complex hierarchies, including: Geographical terms (Regions, Countries, States, Cities...), Product Hierarchies, Site navigation hierarchies, Marketing Segmentation taxonomies, Scientific Taxonomies. Vocabularies provide a manageable and implementation independent mechanism for describing a wide<br><br><br>
variety of finite, controlled and enumerated domain structures that occur frequently in real data management applications.<br>
In conventional Relational systems, the common correlative concept is "lookup table" and Referential Integrity or index. Many relational database applications include tables that exist primarily to constrain the values of certain columns in primary data tables to a set of approved values, be they "States", "Product Id" or "Customer Category." In more complex situations, the set of values may be further organized into hierarchical or poly-hierarchical structures. XML Schema includes only the simple concept of "enumeration" to address restriction of an element or attribute to a finite set of values. Also, Thesaurus-structured Vocabularies are an established construct with flexible application. Accordingly, there is a need to provides support for the conventional structures.<br>
In accordance with the present invention, manageability of structures can be provided by incorporation of granular, inherited permission management, impact analysis, contracts and change management to vocabularies. This functionality can provide substantial advantages for large organizations developing and mamtaining critical definitions.<br>
Intrinsic support for localization can simplify administration and substantially increase the power and usability of vocabularies to power cross-language search and retrieval. Extensible Term Relationship Types can be implemented by taxonomists to design arbitrarily specific and meaningful relationship types that can subsequently be used to analyze, navigate and "subset" vocabularies. Vocabulary views provide a parametrically defined, managed and controlled subset definition mechanism in combination with extensible term relationship types to support the management of common vocabularies that are useful across complex organizations.<br>
Example Vocabulary Properties are shown in Table 9:<br>
Table 9<br><br><br><br>
Vocabulary views (having a 1-to-M relationship) allow users flexibility to present different views or subsets of vocabularies to meet the needs of different contexts. Each vocabulary may have multiple views associated with it. A vocabulary is a collection of relationships between terms. The term relationships themselves actually reference the terms associated with the vocabulary.<br>
Terms<br>
Terms are the conceptual nodes, represented by individual words or phrases used in vocabularies, In a Schema Server they are much more than just a string. Terms are identified by a lifetime GUTD, and include extended internal descriptions and localized translations of term values and descriptions. When used in a vocabulary terms are "related" to each other via "term relationships." By following these relationships there is a path up to the Root term of the vocabulary. Terms can also be used in multiple vocabularies.<br>
The Object Model Term typically inherits all properties of Schema Object, including global Id, Name, Description and workflow properties and change management relationships. Typical properties of the Object Model Term are shown in Table 10:<br>
Table 10<br><br><br><br>
A term value optionally can have a one-to-many (1 - M) relationship. This relationship is used for localization of terms. Not all terms need to have a Term Value (or localized value) but this relationship does allow terms to have different values and descriptions in the context of different languages.<br>
A conventional method for localizing terms in controlled vocabularies is to represent the localized values as separate terms associated to the "preferred term" with a special type of relationship (frequently called an "entry term" relationship). FIGURE 5 is a schematic diagram showing a conventional vocabulary localization using entry terms. In accordance with the present invention, this conventional approach is supported but is supplemented with an intrinsic localization mechanism.<br>
Term localization is incorporated as an intrinsic property set of the Term object. Management is simplified as the term localizations are carried with the Term wherever it is used (in different Vocabularies). Workflow processes are streamlined as modifications to localizations are managed as properties changes to the term. Management of localization processes is enhanced as it is now relatively easy to identify terms within a vocabulary that perhaps have (or have not been) localized in a particular language. Use of localized terms is enhanced as it is now relatively easy to extract a given vocabulary in any language into which it has been localized.<br>
FIGURE 6 is a schematic diagram showing an intrinsic vocabulary localization mechanism using entry terms, in accordance with the present invention. In the figure, the localized values are stored as properties of the Term.<br>
FIGURE 7 is a schematic diagram showing a term relationship of one to many, in accordance with the present invention. As shown in the figure, each<br><br>
Term Relationship has an Origination 610 and a Destination 620 (parent-child) term associated with it. In the diagram below the bold lines are the actual term relationship objects. Thus, "Oregon" and "Washington" are the 'Destination" 620 terms and "States" is the "Origination" 610 term.<br>
Vocabulary View<br>
Vocabulary Views help to reconcile the need for centralized management of enterprise Vocabularies with the need of individual subscribers to consume subsets of sometimes overwhelmingly large sets of terms. Table 10 shows example properties of Vocabulary Views:<br>
Table 10<br><br><br><br>
Vocabulary Views provide a unique, manageable mechanism that allows for large, complex, aggregate or highly multi-constituent vocabularies in a collaborative environment. Vocabulary Views are defined parametrically and use only pre-defined relationships as the mechanism for sub-setting views. From the standpoint of manageability through impact analysis, this approach is markedly superior to a procedural or even non-procedural query-based method based on term properties.<br>
Vocabulary Views as described herein have the following advantages:<br>
Easy for non-programmers to define and maintain;<br>
Are easily evaluated and compared for changes by stakeholders;<br>
Impact analysis logic can determine whether and which vocabulary views are impacted by vocabulary (term or term relationship) changes;<br>
Vocabulary Views are managed as SchemaObjects with the conferred values (Permission control, upstream and downstream impacts, voting, replication);<br>
Easily facilitates management of poly-hierarchical (multi-view) vocabularies with distributed permission control; and<br>
Facilitates securing of views of Vocabularies for high-security applications.<br>
A Vocabulary View is provided using a many-to-one relationship (M -1).  Each Vocabulary view typically must refer to no more than one Vocabulary.<br><br>
Vocabulary news allow users flexibility in the way they view, present, or "subset" vocabularies.<br>
Vocabulary views may be associated with an element which is of type Vocabulary in a one-to-many (1 - M) relationship, If the vocabulary associated to the element has Vocabulary Views associated with it then a vocabulary view may be associated with the element as well. By allowmg this connection users of the system are able to manage a vocabulary as a large monolithic object (for example a complete product vocabulary) but present only the relevant parts to different users. Thus, a product vocabulary may have 5000 terms in it, but a list of only product family names could be delivered to the Marketing department, while the list of all products and versions of products could be delivered to the technical support team.<br>
Vocabulary views may be referenced by the class element object using a one-to-many (1 - M) relationship. This allows for changing the view of a vocabulary in the context of a content class. Class Element<br>
Class Elements are objects used to describe and modify the usage of Element Types in the context of a Content Class. Class elements provide an opportunity to override some elements properties in a content class as well as providing for the ability to define further validation and display rules for an element in the context of a Content Class. Table 11 shows example properties of Class Elements:<br>
Table 11<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
Unlike conventional structures described in, for example, XML, the example Object Model explicitly does not support embedding definitions of sub-elements within the scope of the encompassing structure (in this case Content Class). All sub-element definitions are typically drawn from a globally visible set of Element Typedefinitions. The value of this approach for this application is to encourage global visibility and maximize reuse of definitions, while providing for local contextualization. Local scope definition of Elements (or Attributes) trades off manageability for convenience.<br>
Other advantages include bi-directional navigation of relationships, which facilitates impact analysis and generation of mapping tables. Structured overrides of Element Type properties are facilitated while retaining the underlying core data definitions in Element Type. MVP Rules allow non-procedural encoding of interdependent data validation rules at the class level in a manageable and impact analyzable format. Definition of "implicit" class elements (XML Complex Type/Simple Content) as an advisory property allows greater clarity and generality of structure definitions across models and implementation architectures.<br><br><br>
Class Element objects are annotationai objects that are associated with the relationships that indicate the association of an Element Type with a Content Class, (See Content Class, above, and Element Type, also above).<br>
Term Relationship<br>
The Term Relationship object relates two existing Term objects. A collection of these relations (links) between terms constitutes a vocabulary. Each link has an origination term and a destination term. The destination terms is generally treated as a "child" of the origination term. Depending on the TermRelType of the Term Relationship different business rules apply.<br>
FIGURE 8 is a schematic diagram of two example structures that illustrate term relationships. In Example 2 Seattle is the Destination term and Washington is the Origination Term.<br>
When building Vocabularies, Terms can never be descendents of themselves. Thus, Example 1 shows an invalid tree structure because the term "Washington" is a descendant of itself.<br>
Also, there should be no duplicate relationships between identical terms. There can be multiple relationships between terms, but each relationship typically must be different, hi Example 2 mere are two relationships between "Washington" and "Seattle". This is a valid construct because there are different relationship types used. (See TermRelTypes below for more information.)<br>
Table 12 shows example properties of the Term Relationship object:<br>
Table 12<br><br><br><br>
Each Term Relationship is associated with a vocabulary in a one-to-one relationship. It is possible, when the Term Relationship is of type "Related", that the destination term relationship can refer to a term in a second vocabulary.<br>
Each Term Relationship is associated with a Term Relationship Type (TermRelType). Each Term Relationship Type can have different business rules associated with it, which describe how the Term Relationship can be used in the Vocabulary.<br>
Each term relationship typically has a required one to one relationship with both an Origination Term and a Destination Term.<br>
Term Value<br>
Term Value is an object that allows for the "localization" of vocabulary terms. Each Term may have one term value per language. The list of languages can be managed as one of the enumerated lists mentioned below in Table 13. When using this feature, the term "Name" and "description" are typically localized.<br>
Table 13 shows example properties of the Term Relationship object:<br>
Table 13<br><br><br><br>
A conventional method for localizing terms in controlled vocabularies is to represent the localized values as separate terms associated to the "preferred term" with a special type of relationship (frequently called an "entry term" relationship). In accordance with the present invention, this conventional approach is supported but is supplemented with an intrinsic localization mechanism.<br>
Term localization can be incorporated as an intrinsic property set of the Term object. Management is thereby simplified as the term localizations are carried with the Term wherever it is used (e.g., in different Vocabularies). Workflow processes are streamlined as modifications to localizations are managed as properties changes to the term. Management of localization processes is enhanced as it is now relatively easy to identify terms within a vocabulary that have and/or have not been localized in a particular language. Use of localized terms is enhanced as it is relatively easy to extract a given vocabulary in any language into which it has been localized.<br>
The Term Value is used when a term is "Localized". Thus, each Term may have multiple values where each value is identified with a particular, defined, context. This context may be a language, but it could also be per system, whatever the user deems necessary. The list of "Contexts" is described in the "Languages" enumerated list The Term Value is typically used in a one-to-one (1 -1) relationship.<br>
TermRelType<br>
The TermRelType object describes the Term Relationship object. There are typically three classes of Term Relationship Types and each has a different set of business rules associated with it. FIGURE 9 is a schematic diagram three classes of Term Relationship Types, in accordance with the present invention.<br>
As shown by the figure, Hierarchical Term Relationships (HT) are the primary relationship type used to construct most Vocabulary relationships. These describe a "parent-child" relationship and are often referred to as "Broader Term-Narrower Term" relationships.<br><br><br>
Entry Term Relationships (ET) are often referred to as synonym relationships. The Destination term in these relationships is generally an alternate form of the Originating Term. A destination term in an ET relationship cannot then be an Originating term for other terms in a vocabulary.<br>
Related Term Relationships (RT) are also referred to as "See Also" relationships. These generally occur between terms in HT relationships. For example an RT relationship could occur between the terms "Seattle" and "Portland". In this case the relationship could be used to describe Port cities in the Pacific Northwest. The following example gives potential uses of these relationships. Related term-type relationships can span vocabularies. When related terms point from a term in one vocabulary to a term in another vocabulary, the target term may not be removed from it's vocabulary as long as the relationship exists<br>
Table 14 shows example properties of the TermRelType object:<br><br><br><br>
Table 14<br>
Each Term Relationship is associated with a Term Relationship Type in a one-to-many (1 - M) relationship such that the appropriate business rules, display rules, and usage rules can be applied to the term relationship.<br>
Term relationship types are organized in a simple hierarchy. The base set of Term Relationship Type classes are as describe above: HT, ET, and RT. Term relationship types inherit the business rules of their parent type class. Each Parent TermRelType is associated with child TennRelTypes in a one-to-many (1 -M) relationship.<br>
Schema User<br>
Schema User is an object that describes users of the system. Each user has a Global Role assigned, which is either Administrator or User. Actual permissions per object are usually described in the Permission object.<br>
Table 15 shows example properties of the Schema User object:<br><br>
Table 15<br><br><br>
Users are assigned votes in a one-to-many (1 - M) relationship. The votes are typically associated with change processes to Schema Objects. (See Votes, below.)<br>
When a change is made to any of the Schema Objects the change control process determines if there are any users associated with the object and the permissions that Schema User has with regard to the Schema Object. The Permissions object describes the rights the individual user has with regards to the object. One ofthese rights may be a voting right. Ifthe user has voting rights to the object then there is also a relationship between the Schema User and a Vote object.<br>
Permission<br>
Permission describes the relationship between a SchemaUser object and a Schema Object. The Permission describes the privileges a user has with regards to the management of a particular object.<br>
Table 16 shows example properties of the Schema User object:<br>
Table 16<br><br>
Permission objects establish relationships between Schema Users and any sub-class of SchemaObject (Content Class, Element Type, Vocabulary, Term, Vocabulary View). In conventional file systems, the Permissions object is an implementation of a concept commonly referred to as a "access control list" (ACL).<br><br><br>
The concept is common to filing systems, directories and other network systems where security and auditability are important.<br>
In accordance with the present invention, Permission objects simplify system management by unifying the concepts of create/update/delete access control and voting rights per the prevailing votes. The concept of Permission objects is navigable bi-directionally, allowing review and management of permissions from a user view, in addition to the view of owners of a specified object. Permissions are viewable and manageable by Administrators on a system basis, including the ability to transfer or alter permissions easily from a system console. Permissions can be proxied to other users when they are temporarily unavailable (e.g., during sickness or vacation).<br>
Permissions inherit down vocabulary and content class trees to simplify management of relevant domains of objects. Permissions are used to control and constrain creation and management rights to enhance object reuse of Element Types and Vocabularies; Permission controls are highly granular (apply to single Schema Object definitions e.g. Term, Element Type compared to the standard methodology of managing access control on full document basis encompassing large sets of schema definitions.<br>
Contract<br>
Any Schema Object may have a Contract explicitly and immediately associated with it If a Contract is not immediately associated with it, a Contract-in-force can be identified by the impact analysis logic when an impact is assessed. Each contract typically describes the parameters of the change management process.<br>
Whenever a change is posted to the system the relevant contract is identified. The relevant contract is used to deterroine the voting rights of the users impacted by the change. The Contract also describes the duration of the voting period and other change control rules parameters as specified below in Table 17.<br><br>
Table 17<br><br><br>
		and Delete actions<br>
TimeOut	Integer	Amount of time from the initiation of the change until votes are tallied and the change committed or rolled back.<br>
EnforceTimeout	Boolean	If this value is true then the change cannot be committed until the time out period is complete. Otherwise, if consensus can be achieved at some time before the period ends, the change initiator may cause the change to be committed early.<br>
PostPeriodVotes	Boolean	True - Change initiator may re-initiate a tally of votes and attempt to commit the change after the timeout period has lapsed or an administrator has force canceled the change. This would allow tardy or reconsidered votes to be retailed even after the period has closed and the change been flagged as "failed". False - The change initiator cannot cause a change to be retallied after it has failed through the normal scheduled process or through Administrative intervention.<br>
Contracts are optionally associated with Schema Objects in a one-to-one (1-1) relationship.<br>
In accordance with the present invention, the concept of a rigorous, computer-enforceable agreement between the provider and consumer of a resource is extended from the realm of procedural logic to the realm of structural definition. The concept is further extended from enforcing a static agreement about the definition of a resource to the idea mat the process of change itself is subject to both customization by the parties and to subsequent enforcement by the agent software.<br>
Further, the concept that customization of workflow rules are subject to inheritance allows consensus-oriented change management processes to be<br><br><br>
adjusted with greater flexibility and manageability across organizational or structural boundaries.<br>
Change<br>
Before a change is made to any Schema Object managed in the system, it is processed through a consensus-based change control process. During the change control process, the Change object typically maintains information about the change process. In addition to keeping track of the pending change, the Change object also typically describes the start and end date of the proposed change, the date the change was instantiated, the originator of the change, as well as the type of change proposed and the Change Contract rules that are in force. If the change is accepted then .the Schema Object is modified to reflect the change.<br>
Table 18 shows example properties of the Change object:<br>
Table 18<br><br>
The Change object is maintained in a one-to-one (1 -1) relationship with a Schema Object.<br><br><br>
'The Change object is associated with Vote objects in a one-to-many (1 - M) relationship. When a change is made and the object being changed or the impacted objects being changed have owners with voting rights, the change is held in a "Pending" state until the voting round is complete. The change object describes the proposed changes to the object. Upon the completion of the voting round and an approval of the change the changes are accepted and the change is completed.<br>
Conventional workflow methodologies for document management utilize a state-transition or task-oriented model. In accordance with the present invention, the discipline and challenge of Change Management for Schema presents unique challenges that demand an intrinsically parallel consensus development approach with a fair dealer mediator (in this case Schema Server itself).<br>
Though multiple steps may be taken in the evaluation of the appropriateness of a proposed change, ultimately, the success or failure of the change is decided based upon consensus of the impacted constituencies. Typically the consensus requires unanimity.<br>
The defined Change management object in concert with Contracts and Votes presents a mechanism that is both simpler to understand and use and simpler to manage and configure, which help foster a collaborative culture that in fact will want to use the mechanism.<br>
Vote<br>
The Vote object is used to manage the voting by Schema Users on proposed changes to Schema Objects. Table 19 shows example properties of the Vote object:<br>
Table 19<br><br><br>
A vote object is associated with a Schema User (who has a vote) in a many-to-one relationship. This is typically implemented as a bi-directionally navigable relationship.<br>
For each Change object, there may be from one to many Schema Users voting on the change as in a one-to-many (1 - M) relationship. Each Schema User can have multiple Changes to vote on.<br>
Enumerations<br>
A Schema Object usually has Enumeration objects, which typically include Global User Role, Permission Role, Language, Change State, Work State, and Element Data type. Global User Role is used to regulate the application of business rules. Although two levels are shown in Table 20 below, more levels are possible. Table 20 shows example properties of the Global User Role object:<br>
Table 20<br><br>
Administrator	Administrators typicallyhave create/update/delete permissions to all Schema Objects and have the right to allocate Permissions to User-level Schema Users. Administrators have the  right to force the commitment or the cancellation of Changes.<br>
User	User-level Schema Users must be allocated all rights to create/update/delete Schema Objects by explicit Permission, either from Administrator-level users or from other Users who have direct or inherited Permissions to the Schema Object in question.<br>
Table 21 shows example properties of the Permission Role object:<br>
Table 21<br><br>
Owner	Owners have rights to create, update and delete objects they<br>
have an "Ownership" Permission to.<br>
Ownership of Terms inherit to descendant Terms in a<br><br>
	vocabulary,<br>
Ownership of a Content Class inherits to descendant Content<br>
Classes.<br>
Ownership of Element Type- Global Class Permission allows<br>
creation of new Element Types.<br>
Ownership of Vocabulary- Global Class Permission allows<br>
creation of new Vocabularies and Vocabulary Views and<br>
Term Relationship Types.<br>
Direct or inherited ownership of an object conveys rights to<br>
grant other users Permissions on that object.<br>
Stakeholder	Stakeholders have voting rights on an object the have permission to. The level of voting rights is determined by the prevailing Contract.<br>
Subscriber	Subscribers typically have notification rights only. When a change impacts a Subscriber they are notified by being allocated a "no-vote" Vote. The vote will be ignored when Change votes are tallied.<br>
The Language object is a list of languages and their Local Identifier as discussed above.<br>
The Change object may attain certain states that indicate the process of the change. The Change object and its state are related to but distinct from the Schema Object workstate. (Other states are possible.) Table 22 shows example states of the Change State object:<br>
Table 22<br><br>
Initiated	A change has been initiated but impact analysis has not been performed and votes have not been allocated.<br>
Open	A change has been initiated, votes have been allocated and the voting period is open on the change.<br>
Committed	The change has been tallied and passed and the voting period has either lapsed or does not need to be enforced. The Change has been implemented in the relevant object and is<br><br>
	now "approved".<br>
Failed	The change has been tallied and failed and the voting period has either lapsed or does not need to be enforced. The change has not been implemented and the object status has been returned to "Approved" status quo ante.<br>
Force Commit	The change has been forced to be approved by the intervention of an Administrator despite the tally failing.<br>
Force Cancel	The change has been canceled by an Administrator.<br>
Change Error	An error occurred while attempting to log the change.<br>
Commit Error	An error occurred while attempting to commit the change. The Change commit may be retried.<br>
The Work State object lists certain states that indicate the status of an object. Table 23 shows example states of the Work State object:<br>
Table 23<br><br>
Disabled	The object remains in the system for referential integrity purposes but is no longer available for use. The object is effectively deleted.<br>
Deprecated	The object remains in the system but future use is discouraged.<br>
Approved	The object is an approved standard. The approved state is the default state for most objects.<br>
Pending Add	The object has been added into the system but has not been approved. This status is normally applied only to new Term Relationships.<br>
Pending Update	The object has been updated but the update has not been approved by the impacted users.<br>
Pending Delete	The object has been flagged for deletion but has not been deleted pending approval of the impacted users.<br>
Pending Remove	The Term has been removed from the vocabulary but the operation is pending the approval of the impacted users. Removal indicates the deletion of the Term Relationships<br><br>
	that relate to the term and its descendants in that vocabulary.<br>
Pending Move	The Term has been moved (a Term Relationship has been added and one has been deleted) but the add and delete are pending the approval of the impacted users.<br>
Locked	The vocabulary is locked for access by only the designated user.<br>
Open	The Vocabulary is open for updates. No change transaction will be generated despite impacts.<br>
Example use of Schema Server<br>
An example is given to describe a potential use of the Schema Server. The example does not, however, provide an exhaustive discussion of all the ways the tool could be utilized. The example does show certain functionality related to the five schema objects which allow for contextualizing schemas. These objects include, Class Element Object, Element Value Object, Vocabulary View Object, Term Value Object, and the Term Relationship Type Object. This is accompanied by a Visio diagram, "Object Model Example - Corporate Merger."<br>
FIGURE 10 is a schematic diagram of an example application of a Schema Server Object Model, in accordance with the present invention. In the example of Schema Server, MegaCorp, a theoretical, large corporation, has just acquired a competitor, MiniCoip, a theoretical, small corporation. Among the many tasks facing the new organization is the challenging task of bringing the different information technology tools into alignment so that customer and product information can be shared and ultimately integrated.<br>
Of the many systems involved the customer relationship management (CRM) tools are the first targeted for integration. MegaCorp is currently using a Schema Server object to manage its enterprise schemas. They plan to use Schema Server extensively to model and rationalize the two sets of schemas. MiniCorp has no centralized schema management or repository solution, so its schemas exist in situ. That is to say, each system's schema is represented in the existing systems, but is not described or managed anywhere else.<br>
Step 1 - Identify Existing Elements in SchemaServer:<br><br>
The data integration team finds that the notion of a customer is fairly similar in the two CRM systems. Using a Schema Server, the team is able to consolidate the common data elements. The consolidation process has many different faces as shown in Table 24:<br><br><br>
Table 24<br><br>
Problem	Solution with SchemaServer<br>
Many different systems have equivalent or similar elements that need to be reconciled	Elements from the different systems describing similar concepts can be merged into one. The Class element object allows for creating local names of an element in the context of a Content Class. Other, non-essential, differences can be managed and represented vising the Class Element object as well.<br>
Need to represent Element values in different languages	Elements used in multi-lingual systems can be localized using the Element Value Object which allows for associating different name values per element per language.<br>
Need to be able to manage the change control process	Assigning different levels of permissions to different users of the Elements and Content Classes. By using the Permission and Contract objects the data integration team is able to ensure a viable, comprehensive, and flexible change management process.<br>
Because MegaCorp currently uses a Schema Server to manage and describe its schemas, the schema definitions for MegaCorp's CRM are already described in Schema Server (Fig. 10a). In this first step the elements and content classes in the MiniCorp CRM system are compared to the ones already in SchemaServer. The comparison focuses on concepts described and not just the data structures. For instance there may be elements called Date of Birth and Initial Contact Date. Each of these have the same data type (Date/Time) but they are used to represent different concepts, thus each would be represented by a different element. However, if there were two elements called Birth.Day and BirthDay in the different systems that are used to describe the same concept, then that is a case for merging elements. When doing the comparison the Content Class, Element, and Class Element objects in SchemaServer which represent the MegaCorp elements are used.<br>
As equivalent elements are found they are placed in a content class and the idiosyncratic information (the element name, default value, validation rules, etc) is described in the Class Element object (Fig. 10b).<br><br><br>
Table 25 shows some of the elements used in the two systems to describe a customer. As shown in the table, the naming conventions are different and one of the enumerated lists (Vocabularies) is also different. During this first step a Content Class called "Customer" has been created and it has the elements listed in the Schema Server Element Name column in Table 1. This Content Class has two child Content Classes called MegaCorpCustomer and the newly added MiniCorpCustomer. Each of these Content Classes inherits the elements associated with the Customer Content Class. In the Content Class "MiniCorpCustomer" a Class Element object is used to associate the name "First_Name" to the element "FirstName."<br>
Table 25<br><br><br><br>
There are a number of other Elements and Content Classes that are identified and modeled in this process in addition to the Customer Content Class that is discussed in this example.<br>
Step 2 - Identify MiniCorp Elements which do not exist in SchemaServer:<br>
In this stage the elements in the MiniCorp System which are not represented in a Schema Server are identified and added as new Elements. Thus the Element from Table 1 called "Marital_Status" would be added to the list of Elements in the Schema Server. It would also be associated with the "MiniCorpCustomer" Content Class.<br>
Step 3- Rationalize the Vocabularies (Enumerated Lists):<br>
Another important part of this consolidation process is the merging and mapping of vocabularies or enumerated lists. The Schema Server's ability to manage and represent vocabularies is used extensively in this part of the integration/mapping process. The two enumerated lists described in the set of elements above both describe similar concepts, but use different terms and in the case of the "Sales_Region" Vocabulary different structures and languages. Using the Schema Server, the integration team is able to both integrate equivalent concepts<br><br><br>
and map similar ones, This process has many different faces and used a number of different features in a Schema Server as shown in Table 26:<br>
Table 26<br><br>
The above specification, examples and data provide a complete description of the manufacture and use of the composition of the invention. Since many embodiments of the invention can be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention, the invention resides in the claims hereinafter appended.<br><br><br>
We claim:<br>
1.	A system for managing metadata standards, comprising:<br>
a reference data manager that is arranged to manage common reference data entities that comprise metadata definitions;<br>
a data structural definition metadata manager that is arranged to, in response to the metadata definitions, generate independent structural data that comprise implementation-independent metadata definitions, wherein the implementation-independent metadata definitions are in a format that is capable of being expressed in an arbitrary language; and<br>
an interface object that is arranged to control processes that edit the metadata definitions and to control processes that edit the independent structural data.<br>
2.	The system as claimed in claim 1, wherein the interface object is arranged to evaluate the rights of the processes that edit the metadata definitions and to evaluate the rights of the processes that edit the independent structural data.<br>
3.	The system as claimed in claim 1, wherein the interface object is arranged to expose metadata linkages of the independent data structure in response to input from a user.<br>
4.	The system as claimed in claim 1, wherein the interface object is arranged to reversibly apply edits to the metadata definitions and the independent structural data.<br>
5.	The system as claimed in claim 1, wherein the common reference data entities are one of one of a hierarchical, tabular, and a combination thereof.<br>
6.	The system as claimed in claim 1, wherein the independent structural data comprises a plurality of uniquely identified vocabularies that each comprises uniquely identified reference data terms that have interrelationships that are described by term relationship operators.<br><br><br>
The system as claimed in claim 6, wherein a single uniquely identified reference data term exists simultaneously within the plurality of uniquely identified vocabularies.<br>
The system as claimed in claim 6, wherein a plurality of terms can be interrelated with a same reference data term by the term relationship operators.<br>
The system as claimed in claim 1, wherein the implementation-independent metadata definitions comprise at least one data structure definition element selected from the group consisting of scalar data definitions and complex data structures.<br>
The system as claimed in claim 1, wherein the implementation-independent metadata definitions are arranged in a hierarchical organization that comprises uniquely identified metadata classes, wherein each of the uniquely identified metadata class operates according to the principal inheritance.<br>
The system as claimed in claim 10, wherein the hierarchical organization further comprises a list of ancestor classes that is derived from the uniquely identified metadata classes.<br>
The system as claimed in claim 1, wherein the interface object is further arranged to manage secured and restricted users, wherein the restricted users are granted permission to make provisional changes to the metadata definition objects, and wherein the secured users are granted permission to create, modify, and delete metadata definition objects and to approve the provisional changes to the metadata definition objects.<br>
The system as claimed in claim 12, wherein the restricted users are granted permission in response to an access control list that is associated with the metadata definition objects.<br><br><br>
14. The system as claimed in claim 13, wherein the access control list is applied to hierarchically associated metadata definition objects in accordance with principles of inheritance.<br>
15.	The system as claimed in claim 6, wherein each of the uniquely identified reference data terms is associated with multi-valued collection of localized term names that are indexed by standard language identifiers such that each of uniquely identified reference data terms is arranged to be localized in multiple natural languages.<br>
16.	The system as claimed in claim 6, wherein the term relationship operators are configured to a semantic meaning and constraints in accordance with the type of a particular term relationship operator.<br>
17.	The system as claimed in claim 16, wherein the term relationship operators have an associated type, of which each associate type is hierarchically arranged in accordance with a given uniquely identified vocabulary.<br>
18.	The system as claimed in claim 6, wherein a vocabulary view of one of the uniquely identified vocabularies is defined such that the vocabulary view is arranged to by used as a named object.<br>
19.	The system as claimed in claim 18, wherein the vocabulary view is defined using a start term, degree of generations, start and end term relationship types, and a language specifying into which localized natural language the vocabulary subset is to be displayed.<br>
20.	The system as claimed in claim 18, wherein the interface object is arranged to express the vocabulary view as one of a hierarchical structure and an undifferentiated list.<br><br><br>
The system as claimed in claim 18, wherein the data structure definition element of claim 3 is arranged to reference an element of type vocabulary that references a vocabulary view that is compatible with the element of type vocabulary.<br>
The system as claimed in claim 9, wherein the data structure definition elements comprises a multi-valued collection of localized natural language identifiers such that each of the data structure definition elements is arranged to be localized in multiple natural languages.<br>
The system as claimed in claim 10, wherein the data structure definition elements are arranged to be referenced according to a particular class of the data structure definition elements by one of direct reference, inheritance from ancestor classes, and a combination thereof.<br>
The system as claimed in claim 23, wherein the data structure definition elements are arranged to be referenced such that attributes of the data structure definition can be overwritten in accordance with the particular class of the data structure definition elements.<br>
