(Figure Removed)<br><br>
wherein A, X - and the groups R1, R2, R3, R4, R5 , R6 and R7 may have the meanings given in the claims and specification, processes for preparing them as well as their use as medicaments.<br>
Background to the invention<br>
Anticholinergics may be used to therapeutic effect in a wide range of illnesses. Special mention should be made, for example, of the treatment of asthma or COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease). For treating these complaints, WO 92/16528 proposes anticholinergics which have a scopine, tropenol or tropine basic structure.<br>
The underlying objective of WO 92/16528 is the preparation of anticholinergically effective compounds which are characterised by their long-lasting activity. To achieve this aim WO 92/16528 discloses, inter alia, benzilic acid esters of scopine, tropenol or tropine.<br>
For treating chronic diseases it is often desirable to prepare medicaments with a longer duration of activity. As a rule, this ensures that the concentration of the active substance in the body needed to achieve the therapeutic effect is guaranteed for a longer period without the need to re-administer the drug at frequent intervals. Moreover, giving an active substance at longer time intervals contributes to the wellbeing of the patient to a high degree. It is particularly desirable to prepare a pharmaceutical composition which can be used therapeutically by administration once a day (single dose). The use of a drug once a day has the advantage that the<br><br>
patient can become accustomed relatively quickly to regularly taking the drug at certain times of the day.<br>
In order to be used as a medicament taken once a day, the active substance to be given must meet particular requirements. First of all, the onset of the desired activity should take place relatively quickly after administration of the drug and ideally should have as constant an effect as possible over a subsequent fairly long period of time. On the other hand, the duration of activity of the drug should not substantially exceed a period of about one day. Ideally, an active substance has an activity profile such that the preparation of a drug for administration once a day, which contains the active substance in therapeutically beneficial doses, can be deliberately controlled.<br>
It has been found that the benzilic acid esters of scopine, tropenol and tropine disclosed in WO 92/16528 do not meet these stringent requirements. Because of their extremely long period of activity, which significantly exceeds the above-mentioned period of about one day, they cannot be used therapeutically for administration in a single dose per day.<br>
The aim of the present invention is therefore to provide new anticholinergics which, by virtue of their activity profile, make it possible to prepare a drug for administration once a day. A further objective of the invention is to prepare compounds characterised by a relative rapid onset of activity. The invention further sets out to provide compounds which, after a rapid onset of activity, have as constant an activity as possible over a subsequent lengthy period of time. A further aim of the invention is to provide compounds whose duration of activity does not substantially exceed a period of about one day in therapeutically beneficial doses. Finally, the invention sets out to provide compounds which have an activity profile which ensures good control of the therapeutic effect (i.e. total therapeutic effect without side effects caused by a build-up of the substance in the body).<br><br>

Unless otherwise stated, the alkyl groups are straight-chained or branched alkyl groups having 1 to 4 carbon atoms. The following are mentioned by way of example: methyl, ethyl, propyl or butyl. In some cases the abbreviations Me, Et, Prop or Bu are used to denote the groups methyl, ethyl, propyl or butyl. Unless otherwise stated, the definitions propyl and butyl include all the possible isomeric forms of the groups in question. Thus, for example, propyl includes n-propyl and iso-propyl, butyl includes iso-butyl, sec.butyl and tert.-butyl, etc.<br>
Unless otherwise stated, the alkylene groups are branched and unbranched double-bonded alkyl bridges having 1 to 4 carbon atoms. The following are mentioned by way of example: methylene, ethylene, propylene or butylene.<br>
Unless otherwise stated, the alkylene-halogen groups are branched and unbranched double-bonded alkyl bridges having 1 to 4 carbon atoms which are mono-, di- or<br>
trisubstituted, preferably monosubstituted, by a halogen. Accordingly, unless otherwise stated, the alkylene-OH groups are branched and unbranched double-bonded alkyl bridges having 1 to 4 carbon atoms which are mono-, di- or trisubstituted, preferably monosubstituted, by a hydroxy.<br>
Unless otherwise stated, the term alkyloxy groups denotes branched and unbranched alkyl groups having 1 to 4 carbon atoms which are linked via an oxygen atom.

The compounds according to the invention may partly be prepared, as illustrated below, analogously to procedures which are already known from the prior art (Diagram 1). The carboxylic acid derivatives of formula 3 are known in the art or may be obtained using methods of synthesis known in the art. If only suitably substituted carboxylic acids are known in the art, the compounds of formula 3 may also be obtained directly from them by acid- or base-catalysed esterification with the corresponding alcohols or by halogenation with the corresponding halogenation reagents.<br><br>

Diagram 1:<br>
Starting from the compounds of formula 2 the esters of general formula 4 may be obtained by reacting the carboxylic acid derivatives of formula 3, wherein R may denote chlorine or a C-i-C/j-alkyloxy group, for example. When R denotes C-i-C/j-alkyloxy this reaction may be carried out, for example, in a sodium melt at elevated temperature, preferably at about 50-150°C, most preferably at about 90-100°C at low pressure, preferably below SOOmbar, most preferably below 75mbar. Alternatively, instead of the derivatives 3 wherein R denotes C-|-C4-alkyloxy, the corresponding acid chlorides (R equals Cl) may be used.<br>
The compounds of formula 4 thus obtained may be converted into the target compounds of formula 1 by reacting the compounds R^-X, wherein R2 and X may be as hereinbefore defined. This synthesis step may also be carried out analogously to the examples of synthesis disclosed in WO 92/16528.<br>
Alternatively to the procedure illustrated in Diagram 1 for synthesising the compounds of formula 4 , the derivatives 4 in which the nitrogen bicyclic group is a scopine derivative may be obtained by oxidation (epoxidation) of compounds of formula 4 wherein the nitrogen-bicyclic group is a tropenyl group. This may be done as follows, according to the invention.<br>
Compound 4, wherein A denotes -CH=CH-, is suspended in a polar organic solvent, preferably in a solvent selected from among N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP), dimethylacetamide and dimethylformamide, preferably dimethylformamide , and then heated to a temperature of about 30-90°C, preferably 40-70°C. Then a suitable oxidising agent is added and the mixture is stirred at constant temperature for 2 to 8 hours, preferably 3 to 6 hours. The preferred oxidising agent is vanadium pentoxide mixed with H202, most preferably H2C&gt;2-urea complex combined with vanadium<br>
pentoxide. The mixture is worked up in the usual way. The products may be purified by crystallisation or chromatography, depending on their crystallisation tendencies.<br>
Alternatively, the compounds of formula 4 wherein R7 denotes halogen may also be obtained by the method shown in Diagram 2.<br><br><br><br>

The combination of the compounds of formula 1 according to the invention with salmeterol or formoterol is particularly preferred, whilst the combination with formoterol is most preferred.<br>
Suitable preparations for administering the compounds of formula i include tablets, capsules, suppositories, solutions, etc.<br>
Of particular importance according to the invention (particularly when treating asthma or COPD) is the administration of the compounds according to the invention by inhalation. The proportion of pharmaceutically active compound or compounds should be in the range from 0.05 to 90 % by weight, preferably 0.1 to 50 % by weight of the total composition. Suitable tablets may be obtained, for example, by mixing the active substance(s) with known excipients, for example inert diluents such as calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate or lactose, disintegrants such as corn starch or alginic acid, binders such as starch or gelatine, lubricants such as magnesium stearate or talc and/or agents for delaying release, such as carboxymethyl cellulose, cellulose acetate phthalate, or polyvinyl acetate. The tablets may also comprise several layers.<br>
Coated tablets may be prepared accordingly by coating cores produced analogously to the tablets with substances normally used for tablet coatings, for example collidone or shellac, gum arabic, talc, titanium dioxide or sugar. To achieve delayed release or prevent incompatibilities the core may also consist of a number of layers.<br><br>
Similarly the tablet coating may consist of a number or layers to achieve delayed release, possibly using the excipients mentioned above for the tablets. Syrups or elixirs containing the active substances or combinations thereof according to the invention may additionally contain a sweetener such as saccharine, cyclamate, glycerol or sugar and a flavour enhancer, e.g. a flavouring such as vanillin or orange extract. They may also contain suspension adjuvants or thickeners such as sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, wetting agents such as, for example, condensation products of fatty alcohols with ethylene oxide, or preservatives such as p-hydroxybenzoates.<br>
Solutions are prepared in the usual way, e.g. with the addition of isotonic agents, preservatives such as p-hydroxybenzoates, or stabilisers such as alkali metal salts of ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid, optionally using emulsifiers and/or dispersants, whilst if water is used as the diluent, for example, optionally organic solvents may optionally be used as sofvating agents or dissolving aids, and transferred into injection vials or ampoules or infusion bottles.<br>
Capsules containing one or more active substances or combinations of active substances may for example be prepared by mixing the active substances with inert carriers such as lactose or sorbitol and packing them into gelatine capsules. Suitable suppositories may be made for example by mixing with carriers provided for this purpose, such as neutral fats or poly ethyl en egly col or the derivatives thereof. Excipients which may be used include, for example, water, pharmaceutically acceptable organic solvents such as paraffins (e.g. petroleum fractions), vegetable oils (e.g. groundnut or sesame oil), mono- or polyfunctional alcohols (e.g. ethanol or glycerol), carriers such as e.g. natural mineral powders (e.g. kaolins, clays, talc, chalk), synthetic mineral powders (e.g. highly dispersed silicic acid and silicates), sugars (e.g. cane sugar, lactose and glucose), emulsifiers (e.g. lignin, spent sulphite liquors, methylcellulose, starch and polyvinylpyrrolidone) and lubricants (e.g. magnesium stearate, talc, stearic acid and sodium lauryl sulphate).<br>
The preparations are administered by the usual methods, preferably by inhalation in the treatment of asthma or COPD. For oral administration the tablets may, of course, contain, apart from the abovementioned carriers, additives such as sodium citrate, calcium carbonate and dicalcium phosphate together with various additives such as starch, preferably potato starch, gelatine and the like. Moreover, lubricants such as magnesium stearate, sodium lauryl sulphate and talc may be used at the same time for the tabletting process. In the case of aqueous suspensions the active<br><br>
substances may be combined with various flavour enhancers or colourings in addition to the excipients mentioned above.<br>
The dosage of the compounds according to the invention is naturally greatly dependent on the route of administration and the complaint to be treated. When administered by inhalation the compounds of formula 1 are characterised by high efficacy even at doses in the ug range. The compounds of formula 1 can also be used effectively above the ug range. The dosage may then be in the gram range, for example. Particularly when administered by a method other than inhalation, the compounds according to the invention may be given in higher doses (in the range from 1 to 1000 mg, for example, although this does not imply any limitation).<br>
