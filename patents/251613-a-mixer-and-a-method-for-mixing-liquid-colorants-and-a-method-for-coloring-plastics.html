				<td>The present invention relates to a mixer for liquid<br>
colorants and a method for mixing liquid colorants<br>
performed using this mixer, which is suitable for on-demand<br>
dosing of liquid colorants in plastic processing machines. <br>
In the processing of plastics via plastic melts, the<br>
plastic is typically colored by masterbatches.<br>
Masterbatches are plastic granulates having a high content<br>
of coloring agent, which are added to the plastic during<br>
the processing via the melt in order to color the plastic.<br>
The use of masterbatches has the disadvantage that a<br>
separate masterbatch must be manufactured for every type of<br>
plastic and every color and must be stored ready for the<br>
plastic processing. Rapid changes to new colors or changes<br>
of the color tone are not possible, since a new masterbatch<br>
must be produced in each case.<br>
Instead of masterbatches, liquid colorants may also be used<br>
for coloring plastics, the liquid colorant either being<br>
supplied with the, noncolored plastic granulate to the<br>
machine which processes the plastic or being mixed with the<br>
already melted plastic in the machine. In this method, a<br>
liquid colorant mixed for the desired color tone is used,<br>
so that a corresponding liquid colorant must be produced<br>
and stored for every desired color. Rapid changes to new<br>
colors or a change of the color tone are also not possible<br>
here, since a new liquid colorant must be manufactured in<br>
each case.<br><br>
Supplying multiple liquid colorants separately to a plastic<br>
processing machine and manufacturing plastics having<br>
different color tones via recipe-controlled dosing of the<br>
quantities of the individual liquid colorants has been<br>
suggested in WO 02/087849. This method has the<br>
disadvantage, however, that in the event of recipes having<br>
greatly differing mixing ratios of the individual liquid<br>
colorants, the mixing of the liquid colorants with the<br>
plastic is not sufficiently homogeneous on many plastic<br>
processing machines, so that unevenly colored products are<br>
obtained.<br>
Therefore, there is a need for a mixer and a mixing method,<br>
by which homogeneously mixed liquid colorants for coloring<br>
plastics may be manufactured from individual liquid<br>
colorants according to a recipe, even with greatly<br>
differing proportions of the individual liquid colorants,<br>
the manufacture of the mixture being performed directly<br>
before the processing of the plastic in accordance with the<br>
demand of the plastic processing machine. The mixer must be<br>
capable of reliably mixing even thixotropic liquid<br>
colorants, which only flow at a specific shear load.<br>
WO 99/3-4905 discloses a mixer for manufacturing paints, in<br>
which individual liquid colorants and one or more lacquer<br>
base materials are dosed into a shared chamber of the mixer<br>
and mixed in a downstream turbine mixer, before the mixture<br>
leaves the mixer. However, this mixer is less suitable for<br>
mixing liquid colorants of differing viscosity and density<br>
without adding larger quantities of a lacquer base<br>
material, as is necessary for coloring plastics, since the<br>
mixing of the liquid colorants then remains incomplete.<br><br>
US 3,664,638 discloses static mixers for mixing liquids, in<br>
which multiple helical mixing elements, each having an<br>
alternating rotational direction, are positioned in a pipe<br>
one after another. Static mixers of this construction are<br>
known to those skilled in the art under the names helical<br>
mixers or Kenics mixers and are typically used for mixing<br>
reactive components during the manufacture of two-component<br>
plastics or two-component adhesives.<br>
Dynamic mixers, in which the mixing elements known from the<br>
helical mixers rotate in a mixing pipe, are also used for<br>
manufacturing two-component plastics. In these mixers, the<br>
two components are axially supplied to the mixing pipe at<br>
one end as in the static mixers.<br>
The known static helical mixers and the mixers having<br>
rotating helical mixing elements using axial supply of the<br>
components are not suitable for mixing liquid colorants<br>
having different flow behaviors, however, as are used for<br>
coloring plastics, in the event of greatly differing mixing<br>
conditions. In the event of different viscosities of the<br>
liquid colorants to be mixed, there is uneven mixing of the<br>
more viscous components, for example, so that mixtures<br>
having varying color tone are obtained. Similar problems<br>
also arise if the liquid colorants have different densities<br>
or one or more of the liquid colorants has thixotropic flow<br>
behavior.<br>
JP-A 3-60727 discloses a static mixer in the construction<br>
of helical mixers, in which nozzles are positioned in the<br>
wall of the mixing pipe in order to mix a fluid with a<br>
fluid flowing through the pipe. The mixer is reported to<br>
have a high mixing action if small quantities of a fluid<br><br>
are mixed, via the nozzles in the wall of the mixing pipe, into a large fluid stream which<br>
flows through the mixing pipe.<br>
EP-A 0 90 257 discloses a mixer for multiple component plastics, which has a mixing<br>
chamber having a piston rotating in the mixing chamber, a shear gap forming between<br>
the piston and the mixing chamber. The individual components are dosed radially into<br>
the shear gap and leave the mixer via an outlet opening opposite the piston. The mixer<br>
causes laminar flow in the shear gap and has no devices which move the content of the<br>
shear gap in the direction opposite to the outlet opening. <br>
The object of uniform mixing of liquid colorants, even in the event of greatly differing<br>
proportions of the individual liquid colorants and different flow behaviors of the liquid<br>
colorants, may be achieved by the mixer according to the present invention and the<br>
method for mixing liquid colorants performed using the mixer.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Accordingly, in a first aspect of the invention, there is provided a mixer for liquid<br>
colorants, comprising a) a mixing pipe (1) having an outlet opening (2) at an end of<br>
the mixing pipe (1); b) a mixing unit (3), positioned in the mixing pipe (1) so it is<br>
rotatable around a longitudinal axis of the mixing pipe (1), and having at two mixing<br>
elements (3a, 3b) wherein, when in operation, a portion of said mixing elements (3a,<br>
3b) move a content of the mixer in a direction towards the outlet opening (2) and a<br>
portion of the mixing elements (3a, 3b) move a content of the mixer in an opposite<br>
direction with identical rotational direction of the mixing unit (3), and c) at least two<br>
inlet openings (4, 5) for liquid colorants (6, 7) which are positioned in a wall of the<br>
mixing pipe (1)<br><br><br>
between ends of the mixing pipe (1) in an area of the mixing unit (3) and wherein the<br>
inlet openings (4, 5) for liquid colorants in the mixing unit (3) are positioned so that<br>
during a movement of the mixing unit(3), at least one mixing element (3a, 3b) of the<br>
mixing unit (3) is moved past each of the inlet openings (4, 5) at least than 1 mm<br>
distance.<br>
Furthermore, the subject matter of the present invention is a method for mixing liquid<br>
colorants, in which at least two liquid colorants are mixed in the mixer according to the<br>
present invention, the liquid colorants being supplied to the mixer via the inlet openings<br>
for liquid colorants, while the mixing unit is moved around the longitudinal axis of the<br>
mixing pipe and the mixed liquid colorant leaves the mixer, via the outlet opening at the<br>
end of the mixing pipe.<br>
In addition, the subject matter of the present invention is a method for coloring plastics,<br>
in which at least two liquid colorants are mixed using the method according to the<br>
present invention for mixing liquid colorants with volumetric dosing and the mixed liquid<br>
colorant is supplied directly to a plastic processing machine.<br>
Liquid colorants as defined in the present invention are compositions capable of flowing<br>
which contain one or more pigments in dispersed form and/or one or more dyes in<br>
dissolved form. The liquid colorants may be liquid or pasty and may even comprise<br>
thixotropic compositions, which only flow when a shear force which is higher than their<br>
yield point acts on them. The liquid colorants preferably contain up to 10 wt-%,<br>
particularly up to 5 wt-% pigments.<br>
The mixer according to the present invention has a mixing pipe, at whose end an outlet<br>
opening for the mixed liquid colorant is located. The mixing pipe is preferably<br><br>
implemented so it may be closed during the mixing procedure<br>
at the end opposite the outlet opening, so that the liquid<br>
colorant mixed in the mixing pipe may only leave the mixing<br>
pipe through the outlet opening. A pressure retention valve<br>
may possibly also be positioned on the outlet opening in<br>
order to ensure that no mixed liquid colorant exits from<br>
the outlet opening as long as no liquid colorants are<br>
supplied to the mixer. The mixing pipe preferably has a<br>
circular cross-section and may have a cylindrical or<br>
conical shape, a cylindrical shape being especially<br>
preferred.<br>
A mixing unit is positioned in the mixing pipe so that it<br>
is rotatable around the longitudinal axis of the mixing<br>
pipe. The mixing unit thereby has at least two mixing<br>
elements, a portion of the mixing elements moving the<br>
contents of the mixer in the direction of the outlet<br>
opening and a portion of the mixing elements moving the<br>
contents of the mixer in the opposite direction with<br>
identical rotational direction of the mixing unit. Through<br>
this differing effect of the mixing elements on the<br>
contents of the mixer, back-mixing of the contents is<br>
caused via vortex formation in the mixer. The mixing<br>
elements are preferably dimensioned so that during one<br>
rotation of the mixing unit, the mixing elements are moved<br>
through at least 80 % of the cross-sectional area,<br>
especially preferably at least 90 % of the cross-sectional<br>
area of the mixing pipe. Through such dimensioning, mixing<br>
is caused over the entire cross-section of the mixing pipe.<br>
The mixing unit is preferably implemented so that it is<br>
replaceable, particularly so that it may be pulled out of<br>
the mixing pipe still assembled.<br><br>
The mixing elements of the mixing unit preferably have the<br>
form of helical coils having alternating opposite<br>
rotational directions, as are known to those skilled in the<br>
art from the mixing elements of the helical mixers.<br>
However, other forms of mixing elements may also be used,<br>
such as stirrers having stirring blades with opposing<br>
pitch. The mixing unit preferably has at least 5,<br>
especially preferably at least 9 mixing elements, each<br>
having a different action on the contents of the mixer.<br>
The actuation of the mixing unit, which sets the mixing<br>
unit in motion, may be produced arbitrarily. Preferably,<br>
the mixing unit is driven via a motor. The mixing unit is<br>
especially preferably driven from the end of the mixing<br>
pipe opposite the outlet opening via a shaft lying in the<br>
longitudinal axis of the mixing pipe. The mixing unit may<br>
be set into an oscillating or rotating movement by the<br>
drive, a rotating movement being preferred. If multiple<br>
mixing elements extend up to near the wall of the mixing<br>
pipe, in the event of a drive via a shaft lying in the<br>
longitudinal axis of the mixing pipe, no additional<br>
mounting of the mixing element in the mixing pipe is<br>
necessary.<br>
The mixer according to the present invention additionally<br>
has at least two inlet openings for liquid colorants, which<br>
are positioned in the wall of the mixing pipe lying between<br>
the ends of the mixing pipe in the area of the mixing unit.<br>
The liquid colorants are accordingly supplied to the mixing<br>
pipe radially through the wall of the mixing pipe and not<br>
axially at the end of the mixing pipe. The inlet openings<br>
for liquid colorants are thereby preferably positioned so<br>
that at least 60 % and especially preferably more than 80 %<br>
of the length of the mixing unit lies between the inlet<br><br>
openings and the outlet opening at the end of the mixing<br>
pipe. The inlet openings for liquid colorants preferably<br>
lie in one to three planes and especially preferably in<br>
only one plane transverse to the longitudinal axis of the<br>
mixing pipe. The inlet openings may additionally be<br>
provided with shutoff valves or non-return valves, in order<br>
to prevent mixed liquid colorant from flowing back from the<br>
mixer into the lines leading to the inlet openings.<br>
The inlet openings for liquid colorants and the mixing unit<br>
are preferably positioned so that during the movement of<br>
the mixing unit, at least one mixing element of the mixing<br>
unit is moved past each of the inlet openings at a small<br>
distance, preferably less than 1 mm distance, particularly<br>
preferably less than 0.5 mm distance. A high shear force is<br>
thus attained at the inlet openings for liquid colorants<br>
and improved mixing is achieved.<br>
The mixer according to the present invention may<br>
additionally have one or more additional inlet openings for<br>
flushing liquid and/or compressed air, preferably both for<br>
flushing liquid and for compressed air, in order to be able<br>
to empty and clean the mixer in the event of a color<br>
change. In addition, the mixer may also have one or more<br>
outlet openings which allow emptying independently from the<br>
outlet opening at the end of the mixing pipe. The inlet<br>
openings for flushing liquid and/or compressed air and<br>
possibly additional outlet openings are preferably<br>
positioned radially near one end of the mixing pipe or<br>
axially at one end of the mixing pipe.<br>
The method according to the present invention for mixing<br>
liquid colorants is performed in the mixer according to the<br><br>
present invention. Thereby, the liquid colorants are<br>
supplied to the mixer via the inlet openings for liquid<br>
colorants, while the mixing unit is moved around the<br>
longitudinal axis of the mixing pipe and the mixed liquid<br>
colorant leaves the mixer via the outlet opening at the end<br>
of the mixing pipe. Preferably, all openings besides the<br>
inlet openings for liquid colorants and the outlet opening<br>
at the end of the mixing pipe remain closed during the<br>
mixing procedure, so that the liquid colorants supplied via<br>
the inlet openings may only leave the mixing pipe via the<br>
outlet opening at the end of the mixing pipe after the<br>
mixing. In particular, the end of the mixing pipe opposite<br>
the outlet opening remains closed during the mixing.<br>
The movement of the mixing unit during the supply of the<br>
liquid colorants may be oscillating or rotating, a rotating<br>
movement being preferred. A rotating movement at<br>
essentially constant speed is especially preferred. The<br>
velocity of the movement of the mixing unit may be selected<br>
by those skilled in the art within wide limits in<br>
accordance with the properties of the liquid colorants to<br>
be mixed. The velocity of the movement is selected so that<br>
it is at least sufficiently high for uniform mixing to be<br>
achieved. The velocity of the movement has an upward limit<br>
only by the occurrence of cavitation at the mixing<br>
elements. As long as gas, such as air, is still contained<br>
in the mixer, the velocity of the movement is preferably<br>
selected low, in order to avoid mixing in gas bubbles and<br>
to obtain a bubble-free mixture.<br>
The method according to the present invention for mixing<br>
liquid colorants is preferably performed continuously or<br>
intermittently. If it is performed continuously, the liquid<br>
colorants are supplied in predefined volume ratios, so that<br><br>
a continuous flow of the mixed liquid colorant leaves the<br>
mixer. If the method is performed intermittently, the<br>
liquid colorants are supplied in predefined volume ratios<br>
alternately in each case in a first time interval, while,<br>
in a following second time interval, the liquid colorants<br>
are not supplied. In intermittent operation, mixed liquid<br>
colorant only leaves the mixer during the first time<br>
interval, but not during the second time interval.<br>
The liquid colorants are preferably supplied to the inlet<br>
openings for liquid colorants by volumetric dosing. In this<br>
case, the liquid colorants are supplied using predefined<br>
volume flows in predefined volume ratios, which result from<br>
the recipe for the desired color. The volumetric dosing is<br>
preferably performed through forced-delivery pumps, in<br>
which the delivered volume results inevitably from the<br>
mechanical movement of the pump. Suitable forced-delivery<br>
pumps are, for example, piston pumps, rotary piston pumps,<br>
and gear pumps. Double-piston pumps are preferably used for<br>
dosing the liquid colorants, in which liquid colorant is<br>
dosed alternately by one of two pistons, while the other<br>
piston is filled, so that a constant volume flow is dosed.<br>
Through volumetric dosing using forced-delivery pumps, a<br>
uniform composition of the mixed liquid colorant may be<br>
achieved reproducibly, without variations in the control of<br>
the dosing resulting in color variations. In addition,<br>
through the volumetric dosing, the quantity flow of mixed<br>
liquid colorant which leaves the mixer may be set<br>
precisely, so that using the method according to the<br>
present invention, the liquid colorant may be dosed<br>
directly into a plastic processing machine. In this case,<br>
the dosing may be performed continuously into a<br>
continuously operating plastic processing machine, for<br>
example, into an extruder. Similarly, dosing may also be<br>
performed intermittently into a discontinuously operating<br><br>
plastic processing machine, such as an injection molding<br>
machine.<br>
The volumetric dosing of the liquid colorants into the<br>
mixer according to the present invention is preferably<br>
controlled by the plastic processing machine, so that<br>
dosing may be performed directly into the plastic<br>
processing machine without an intermediate container. The<br>
control of the dosing of the liquid colorants into the<br>
mixer according to the present invention by the plastic<br>
processing machine is especially advantageously used for<br>
dosing into discontinuously operating plastic processing<br>
machines, such as injection molding machines.<br>
The direct dosing from the method according to the present<br>
invention into a plastic processing machine allows rapid<br>
color change or an alteration of the color tone during the<br>
plastic processing, without a colorant mixture having to be<br>
prepared beforehand for this purpose or a colorant<br>
container having to be changed on the plastic processing<br>
machine.<br>
Forced-delivery pumps which are driven by stepping motors<br>
are especially preferably used for dosing the liquid<br>
colorants. These pumps have the advantage of a<br>
significantly broader range of precisely and uniformly<br>
adjustable dosing rates compared to continuously driven<br>
pumps having variable-speed drive. While with variable-<br>
speed drive, the range from minimum to maximum dosing rate<br>
is typically not more than 1:100, by using a drive having<br>
stepping motors, ranges of more than 1:1000 may be<br>
implemented. Therefore, a larger range of mixing ratios may<br>
be set without replacing pumps and therefore a larger<br><br>
number of color tones may be produced. Motorized piston<br>
burettes which are driven by stepping motors are especially<br>
suitable for dosing the liquid colorants.<br>
In the method according to the present invention the supply<br>
of the liquid colorants to the inlet openings for liquid<br>
colorants may be performed continuously or in fixed cycles<br>
in each case. Through the back-mixing occurring in the<br>
mixing pipe, even with fixed-cycle supply of one or more<br>
liquid colorants, uniform mixing without variations of the<br>
composition over time may be achieved using the mixer<br>
according to the present invention if the ratio between the<br>
average hold-up time of the mixed liquid colorant and the<br>
duration of a fixed cycle in the mixer is more than 5:1,<br>
preferably more than 10:1. The duration of a fixed cycle<br>
according to the present invention is the sum of the<br>
duration of an individual step of the colorant supply into<br>
the mixer and the duration of a pause between two such<br>
steps of the colorant supply. Through the possibility of<br>
fixed-cycle supply, even mixtures having greatly differing<br>
ratios of the liquid colorants used may be manufactured<br>
reproducibly without color variations using the method<br>
according to the present invention.<br>
In the method according to the present invention, the<br>
mixing procedure is preferably interrupted for a color<br>
change and the mixer is cleaned using- a flushing liquid in<br>
order to obtain a mixed liquid colorant having altered and<br>
uniform composition as rapidly as possible and keep the<br>
quantities of waste arising from a color change low. For<br>
this purpose, the supply of the liquid colorants is first<br>
interrupted and the mixing pipe is emptied by supplying<br>
compressed air. Subsequently, the mixing pipe is filled at<br>
least once with flushing liquid and the mixing unit is<br><br>
moved in order to remove the liquid colorant adhering to<br>
the mixing pipe and to the mixing unit with the flushing<br>
liquid. The mixing pipe is then emptied once again by<br>
supplying compressed air and subsequently the supply of the<br>
liquid colorants is continued in another ratio. If, in the<br>
- method according to the present invention, the liquid<br>
colorant is dosed directly into a plastic processing<br>
machine, the contents of the mixing pipe emptied using<br>
compressed air and a first part of the liquid colorant<br>
mixed using an altered ratio are expediently conveyed to a<br>
separate collection container during the cleaning<br>
procedure, before the direct dosing into the plastic<br>
processing machine is continued. In principle, any liquid<br>
which is capable of dissolving or dispersing the components<br>
of the liquid colorant is suitable as the flushing liquid.<br>
The flushing procedure is preferably performed so that at<br>
the end of the flushing procedure, all lines connected to<br>
the mixing pipe are filled with liquid. By avoiding gas<br>
cushions in supply lines, a more 'uniform flow of the mixed<br>
liquid colorant out of the mixer may be obtained during the<br>
following mixing procedure.<br>
If an inlet opening is not needed for manufacturing the<br>
currently needed mixture of liquid colorants, the supply<br>
line for liquid colorant leading to this inlet opening is<br>
preferably at least partially filled with mixed liquid<br>
colorant from the mixing pipe after beginning the supply of<br>
the liquid colorants. This is preferably performed by<br>
briefly operating a pump used for supplying the liquid<br>
colorant in the reverse delivery direction. By at least<br>
partially filling the supply line with already mixed liquid<br>
colorant, contamination of the currently mixed liquid<br>
colorant by an undesired liquid colorant from a currently<br><br>
unneeded inlet opening may be avoided. In an alternative<br>
embodiment, the supply lines to unneeded inlet openings may<br>
also be at least partially filled with flushing liquid<br>
during the flushing procedure.<br>
In the method according to the present invention for mixing<br>
liquid colorants, in addition to the at least two liquid<br>
colorants, still further free-flowing components or<br>
compositions may also be supplied via the inlet openings<br>
positioned in the wall of the mixing pipe. During the<br>
manufacturing of liquid colorants for coloring plastics,<br>
for example, UV stabilizers, antioxidants, flame<br>
retardants, plasticizers, or additives which improve the<br>
impact strength may also be admixed in order to add them to<br>
the plastic with the mixed liquid colorant.<br>
Figure 1 shows a preferred embodiment of the mixer<br>
according to the present invention having mixing elements<br>
in the form of. helical co_jls, additional inlet openings for<br>
flushing liquid and compressed air, and dosing of the<br>
liquid colorants by volumetrically dosing double-piston<br>
pumps.<br>
Figure 2 shows the flow of liquid colorants plotted against<br>
time t for continuous operation of the mixer with<br>
continuous dosing of the first liquid colorant at a flow<br>

Figure 3 shows the flow of liquid colorants plotted against<br>
time t for intermittent operation of the mixer with<br>
continuous dosing of the first liquid colorant at a flow<br>
rate Fi and fixed-cycle dosing of the second liquid<br>
colorant at a flow rate F2. During the intermittent<br>
operation, both liquid colorants are each dosed for a first<br>
time interval t2 and the dosing of both liquid colorants is<br>
interrupted for a second time interval t-$.<br>
Figure 4 shows a preferred embodiment of the mixer<br>
according to the present invention having two mixing pipes.<br>
In the embodiment of Figure 1, the mixer comprises a<br>
cylindrical mixing pipe (1) having an outlet opening (2) at<br>
the lower end of the mixing pipe (1). In the mixing pipe<br>
(1), a mixing unit (3), which is driven by a motor via a<br>
shaft (8), is positioned so it is rotatable around the<br>
longitudinal axis of the mixing pipe (1). The mixing unit<br>
(3) has a total of 5 mixing elements (3a, 3b) in the form<br>
of helical coils having alternating opposite rotational<br>
directions, which are moved through more than 80 % of the<br>
cross-sectional area of the mixing pipe (1) during a<br>
rotation of the mixing unit (3). With identical rotational<br>
direction of the mixing unit (3), a first portion of the<br>
mixing elements (3a) moves the contents of the mixer in the<br>
direction of the outlet opening and a second portion of the<br>
mixing elements (3b) moves the contents of the mixer in the<br>
opposite direction. The mixer additionally has two inlet<br>
openings (4, 5) for liquid colorants (6, 7), which are<br>
positioned in the wall of the mixing pipe lying between the<br>
ends of the mixing pipe (1) in the area of the mixing unit<br>
(3) in a plane transverse to the longitudinal axis of the<br>
mixing pipe (1), so that more than 60 % of the length of<br>
the mixing unit (3) lies between the inlet openings (4, 5)<br><br>
and the outlet opening (2) at the end of the mixing pipe<br>
(1). The inlet openings (4, 5) for liquid colorants (6, 7)<br>
and the mixing unit (3) are positioned in this case so that<br>
during the movement of the mixing unit, a mixing element<br>
(3b) is moved past the inlet openings (4, 5) at less than<br>
0.5 mm distance. The mixer also has an additional inlet<br>
opening (9) for flushing liquid (10) and compressed air<br>
(11) •<br>
In an especially preferred embodiment of the method<br>
according to the present invention, two liquid colorants<br>
(6, 7) are supplied by double-piston pumps (13, 14) to the<br>
mixing pipe (1) via the inlet openings (4, 5) for liquid<br>
colorants (6, 7), while the mixing unit (3) rotates around<br>
the longitudinal axis of the mixing pipe (1). The end of<br>
the mixing pipe (1) opposite the outlet opening (2) and the<br>
additional inlet opening (9) remain closed in this case, so<br>
that all of the quantity of liquid colorants (6, 7)<br>
supplied via the inlet openings (4, 5) leaves the mixer as<br>
mixed liquid colorant (12) via the outlet opening (2) and a<br>
valve (15). The double-piston pumps (13, 14) are driven via<br>
stepping motors in this case, so that the liquid colorants<br>
(6, 7) may be supplied to the mixer in fixed cycles, the<br>
ratio between the duration of a cycle and the average hold-<br>
up time of the mixed liquid colorant in the mixer being<br>
selected as less than 1: 10. The mixed liquid colorant (12)<br>
is supplied directly to a plastic processing machine, the<br>
volumetric dosing of the liquid colorants (6, 7) being<br>
activated by the plastic processing machine.<br>
For a color change, the mixer shown in Figure 1 is<br>
especially preferably cleaned by first stopping the dosing<br>
of the liquid colorants (6, 7) and closing the valve (15)<br>
via which the mixed liquid colorant (12) is supplied to a<br><br>
plastic processing machine. Subsequently, compressed air<br>
(11)	is supplied via the additional inlet opening (9) and<br>
the contents of the mixing pipe (1) are emptied as a waste<br>
stream (16) into a collection container via the valve (15).<br>
The mixing pipe (1) is then filled completely with a<br>
flushing liquid (10) via the additional inlet opening (9)<br>
with valve (15) closed, the mixing unit (3) rotating and<br>
the mixing pipe (1) being ventilated via a ventilation<br>
opening (not shown) at the upper end of the mixing pipe<br>
(1). After approximately 3 0 seconds, during which the<br>
mixing unit (3) rotates further, compressed air (11) is<br>
supplied via the additional inlet opening (9) and the<br>
contents of the mixing pipe (1) are emptied as a waste<br>
stream (16) into a collection container via the valve (15).<br>
This flushing procedure is subsequently repeated again<br>
twice. The speed of the mixing unit (3) is then reduced and<br>
the liquid colorants (6, 7) are dosed at the new ratio, the<br>
valve (15) initially remaining open so that the mixed<br>
liquid colorant is supplied to a collection container as a<br>
waste stream (16). After a quantity of liquid colorants<br>
(6, 7) corresponding to the volume of the mixing pipe (1)<br>
has been dosed and the air has thus been displaced out of<br>
the mixing pipe' (1), the speed of the mixing unit (3) is<br>
increased back to the original value. After a quantity of<br>
liquid colorants (6, 7) which corresponds to two to three<br>
times the volume of the mixing pipe (1) has been dosed, the<br>
valve (15) is switched so that the mixed liquid colorant<br>
(12)	is again supplied to the plastic processing machine.<br>
In the embodiment of Figure 4, the mixer comprises two<br>
mixing pipes (1), each comprising an outlet opening (2), a<br>
mixing unit (3) and inlet openings (4, 5). Liquid colorants<br>
(6, 7) are supplied to the inlet openings (4, 5) by double-<br>
piston pumps (13, 14), whereby in each of the double-piston<br>
pumps the pistons may be actuated independently of each<br><br>
other and liquid colorant can be dosed from either of the<br>
two pistons independently of each other into either of the<br>
two mixing pipes via appropriately arranged valves. The two<br>
mixing pipes are connected by a valve (15) designed as a<br>
four-way valve in such a manner, that alternatively one of<br>
the mixing pipes is connected via a line with the device<br>
into which the mixed liquid colorant (12) is dosed, while<br>
at the same time the other mixing pipe is connected with a<br>
collection container for the waste stream (16). In addition<br>
to inlet openings (9) for flushing liquid (10) the mixer<br>
preferably also comprises valves (17), whereby flushing<br>
liquid (10) or compressed air (11) can also be passed via<br>
the outlet opening (2) into the mixing pipe (3), as well as<br>
additional outlet openings (18) for waste streams (19) at<br>
the end of the mixing pipe (3) opposite to the outlet<br>
opening (2). The additional valves (17) and outlet openings<br>
(18) allow flushing of the mixing pipe in both directions<br>
and thereby more effective cleaning of the mixing pipe for<br>
a color change.<br>
The preferred embodiment of the mixer according to Figure 4<br>
allows a liquid colorant with a new, altered mixing ratio<br>
to be prepared in a second mixing pipe for a color change,<br>
while still dosing from a first mixing pipe at the old<br>
mixing ratio. This shortens the down time for a color<br>
change, since only the line for mixed liquid colorant (12)<br>
leading from valve (15) to the consuming device has to be<br>
flushed or exchanged for the color change, while the<br>
cleaning of the mixing pipe can occur without interruption<br>
of the dosing of liquid colorant. The second mixing pipe is<br>
flushed and emptied with flushing liquid (10) and<br>
compressed air (11) as described above, while liquid<br>
colorants (6, 7) are still dosed into the first mixing pipe<br>
at the old mixing ratio and a mixed liquid colorant is<br>
obtained at the old mixing ratio via valve (15). Besides<br><br>
the supply of flushing liquid and compressed air via inlet<br>
opening (9) and emptying via valve (15), there is<br>
preferably additional flushing in the opposite direction by<br>
the supply of flushing liquid and compressed air via valve<br>
(17) and emptying via outlet opening (18). Subsequently,<br>
the second mixing pipe is filled with liquid colorants<br>
(6, 7) in the new mixing ratio as described above, while<br>
the dosing of liquid colorants into the first mixing pipe<br>
is continued at the old mixing ratio. For that purpose, the<br>
two pistons of a double-piston pump (13, 14) are operated<br>
in such a manner as to dose from one of the pump pistons<br>
into the first mixing pipe according to the old mixing<br>
ratio, while dosing from the other pump piston into the<br>
second mixing pipe according to the new mixing ratio. If<br>
one of the pump pistons dosing into the first mixing pipe<br>
has to be filled during this procedure, the filling of the<br>
second mixing pipe is interrupted, the ongoing dosing is<br>
switched to the second, still filled pump piston, the first<br>
pump piston is filled and thereafter filling of the second<br>
mixing pipe is continued, so that the ongoing dosing into<br>
the first mixing pipe is not interrupted. Preferably, with<br>
each of the double-piston pumps the pump piston not<br>
actually needed for dosing into the first mixing pipe is<br>
filled before the second mixing pipe being filled, then all<br>
pumps are switched to dosing into the first mixing pipe<br>
from the filled piston, thereafter the second pump piston<br>
not currently needed for dosing into the first mixing pipe<br>
is likewise filled and then filling of the second mixing<br>
pipe is started. With this procedure, the filling of the<br>
second mixing pipe can normally be completed before a<br>
switch between the pistons of a double-piston pump becomes<br>
necessary for the dosing into the first mixing pipe.<br><br>
Examples<br>
The experiments were performed in a mixer corresponding to<br>
Figure 1 with a mixing pipe (1) having 8.3 mm internal<br>
diameter and 10 cm length. The mixing pipe had two inlet<br>
openings (4, 5), each 1.5 mm in diameter, at 8 cm distance<br>
to the outlet opening (2). A helical mixer MR 08-12 having<br>
8 mm diameter and 93 mm length from Mixpac, which has 12<br>
mixing elements in the form of helical coils with opposing<br>
directions, was used as the mixing unit (3). The mixing<br>
unit was set in rotation by a motor at 1500 rpm. Motorized<br>
burettes model PSD/8 from Hamilton were used as piston<br>
pumps (13, 14) for dosing the liquid colorants.<br>
Example 1<br>
A red and a white Polytrend 7 00 liquid colorant from<br>
Colortrend were supplied intermittently to the mixer<br>
radially via two different inlet openings (4, 5) in the<br>
volume ratio 10:9, resulting in a total volume flow of<br>
1.8 ml/min. The time interval for supplying the liquid<br>
colorants and the time interval for interrupting the supply<br>
were each 10 seconds. To judge the mixing quality,<br>
individual droplets of mixed liquid colorant obtained at<br>
the outlet opening (2) were drawn out thinly on a<br>
microscope slide and visually evaluated. No inhomogeneities<br>
or variations of the color tone could be observed in the<br>
mixed liquid colorant.<br>
Example 2 (Comparative Example)<br>
Example 1 was repeated, but the two liquid colorants were<br>
not supplied radially via the inlet openings (4, 5), but<br><br>
axially via inlet openings in the end of the mixing pipe<br>
opposite to the outlet opening (2). The mixed liquid<br>
colorant had clearly recognizable variations in the color<br>
tone.<br><br>
