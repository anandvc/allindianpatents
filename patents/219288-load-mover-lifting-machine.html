A.	Back ground for the invention of load mover lifting machine:<br>
Load mover lifting machine is related to field of mechanical / &amp; automobile engineering. With the existing technology, it is possible to increase the speed of any vehicle with only IC engines or battery operated motors, etc. Gear systems are available for bicycles only; even then speed is limited.<br>
When compared to cycles and motor car, load mover lifting machine moves vehicle by human efforts through lifting machines such as different systems of pulleys, wheel and axle, worm and wheel, single, double purchase grab winches or gear train requires no fixel and IC engine, has gear box with incremental gear ratio, no clutch is required to change gear stage, speed is achieved is as that of a motor car while cheaper than it, economical even for single seated, gives out no pollution. The object is to bring forth cost effective, smokeless, fuel independent and safe travel vehicle. The aim is to move and increase speed of a vehicle under the application of possible human efforts only.<br>
B.	Summary of the invention:<br>
A device for moving vehicle by transmitting part of gravitational forces of vehicle to the input of speed increasing device by balancing major part of weight of vehicle on the point of virtually increased fiiction of road resistance and effort. When effort is applied the major part of weight of vehicle is shifted from the points of contact on road to the point of virtually increased fiiction of road resistance using different systems of pulleys, geared pulley block, wheel and axle, worm and wheel, single, double purchase grab winches or gear train.<br>
Using these load lifting machines instead of movable pulley or movable part moving up to lift the load, the fixed pulley or the supporting shaft moves dovra driving the driving sprocket or gear and hence the speed increasing device. The vehicle is then set to motion.<br>
C.	Description of the invention<br>
The force required, to be applied, for tricycle to move is through human effort and weight, which is just sufiBcient to overcome the static fiiction of road resistance. The speed attained is about 15-km/hr. For increasing this speed twice or thrice, speed increasing device can be provided but that will increase the requirement of more effort. This effort will be very much higher than that of humanly possible.<br>
The load lifting machines can be effectively utilized to move the vehicles. A load lifting machine is connected to the vehicle in the manner described as under. When an effort is applied to the load lifting machine, part of weight of vehicle is getting shifted to the input of speed increasing device whose output to input gear ratio is more than one. When the major part of weight of vehicle lift-effected is equal to the virtually increased fiiction of road resistance caused due to the remaining part of weight of vehicle and the<br><br>
effort, the vehicle is set to motion. Here in this arrangement of load lifting machine instead of load being lifted, the fixed support pulls down or rotates the speed increasing device.<br>
In fig (i), when an effort is applied on the pedal (3), the movable part of load lifting machine (4) tries to pull up the vehicle through the hook (1) with respect to the shaft (6) that acts as a fixed support. This shaft is fixed on the circumference of driving sprocket (7). Its initial support will be very high because of high virtually increased friction of road resistance.<br>
Weight of vehicle on the point of contact on road gradually reduces and gets shifted on the shaft. This tends the road resistance to decrease, which in turn reduces the virtually increased fiiction of road resistance from very high value.<br>
When major part of weight of vehicle equals the virtually increased fiiction of road resistance caused due to the remaining part of weight of vehicle and the effort, the shaft (6) moves down. Here instead of vehicle being lifted up the fixed support, the shaft, comes down. Hence the vehicle is set to motion.<br>
In fig (ii), when an effort is applied on the pedal (3), the chain (2) is pulled up with respect to the fixed pulley block (5). As this fixed pulley block is suspended from the shaft (6) fixed on the circumference of driving sprocket (7) its initial support will be very high because of virtually increased fiiction of road resistance. As the load of vehicle is connected to the movable pulley (1), the majority of weight of the vehicle is equally shared by effort and the fixed pulley block (5). This reduces the virtually increased fiiction of road resistance tending the shaft (6) to move down and hence the vehicle is set to motion.<br>
In fig (iii) the fixed pulley (4) finds very high resistance for its rotation because of virtually increased fiiction of road resistance due to speed increasing device. When an effort is appUed on the crank sprocket (3) the effort side of chain (2) tries to pull up the movable pulley (1) with respect to that part of chain passing over the fixed pulley. Thus major part of weight of vehicle is equally shared by effort and the circumference of the fixed pulley. This part of load of vehicle is available as the torque required to rotate the driving sprocket through shaft (6).<br>
In fig (iv), when effort is appUed, the effort sprocket (3) pulls the driving sprocket (7), which drives the speed increasing device (8). The virtually increasing fiiction of road resistance is very high. Hence the load sprocket (1) is lift-effected. In fig (xii), the application of effort is in the reverse direction for reverse movement of vehicle. The major part of weight of vehicle is equally shared by the effort and the force required to overcome the virtually increased fiiction of road resistance. This virtually increased fiiction is now due to the remaining part of weight of vehicle. The vehicle is then set to motion.<br>
In fig (v), when an effort is applied through the effort sprocket (3), the system of pulleys (1) passes on major part of weight of vehicle from its bottom movable part to the<br><br>
top sprocket (5) through the chain I (4), driving the sprocket (7). The effort applied is less whereas major part of weight of vehicle is supplied as the torque required to rotate the driving sprocket (7) and hence the vehicle is set to motion.<br>
In fig (vi), when an effort is applied through the effort sprocket (3), the system of pulleys (1) passes on major part of weight of vehicle fi^om its bottom movable part to the top rack and pimon (5), driving the driving sprocket (7). The effort applied is less whereas major part of weight of vehicle is supplied as the torque required to rotate the pinion (6) and the speed increasing device and hence the vehicle is set to motion.<br>
In fig (vii), effort is applied at pedal (4) of wheel and axle. Initially, the virtually increased fiiction of road resistance will be very high and is available in sprocket (7). The vehicle tends to be lifted. But before being lifted, the vehicle is set to motion when major part of weight of vehicle equal to the virtually increased friction of remaining part of weight of vehicle is transmitted to the shaft (6), pulling the shaft down and hence the sprocket (7) is rotated.<br>
In fig (viii), for single or double purchase grab winches or geared pulley block, description is same as that of fig (vii), with a difference the effort is applied through lever<br>
(4).<br>
In fig (ix), application of effort on effort gear (2) rotates it anticlockwise. The load<br>
gear (1) tries to rotate clockwise, but finds very high resistance due to virtually increased<br>
friction of road resistance on the teeth of driving gear (7). As effort continues, the load<br>
gear (1) tries to pull up the vehicle with respect to this very high resistance. Weight of<br>
vehicle on point of contact on road starts reducing and gets shifted on the teeth of driving<br>
gear (7). This in turn reduces the road resistance and hence the virtually increased friction<br>
of road resistance decreases.<br>
When major part of weight of vehicle shifted equals the virtually increased fiiction of road resistance, the driving gear (7) gets rotated anti-clockwise. Hence, the vehicle is set to motion.<br>
The driving gear can also be an internal gear as shown in fig (11). In order to get mechanical advantage, the load gear can be arranged as a gear assembly with the larger part of it coupled to effort gear and smaller part is coupled to driving gear as shown in fig(lO),<br>
According to the invention, there is provided a load mover lifting machine comprising a hook on vehicle, load lifting machine, shaft, driving sprocket and speed increasing device means having the output to input gear ratio more than one, wherein the said hook on vehicle means the load of vehicle; the said hook is connected to the movable part of the said load lifting machine; the said load lifting machine is suspended from the said shaft; the said shaft is fixed on the circumference of the said driving sprocket; the said driving sprocket which is free to rotate on its axis drives the said speed increasing device.<br><br>

B.	Sunmary of the invention:<br>
A device for moving vehicle by transmitting part of gravitational forces of vehicle to the input of speed increasing device by balancing major part of weight of vehicle on the point of virtually increased friction of road resistance and effort. When effort is applied the major part of weight of vehicle is shifted from the points of contact on road to the point of virtually increased fuction of road resistance using different systems of pulleys, geared pulley block, wheel and axle, worm and wheel, single, double purchase grab winches or gear train.<br>
Using these load lifting machines instead of movable pulley or movable part moving up to lift the load, the fixed pulley or the supporting shaft moves down driving the driving sprocket or gear and hence the speed increasing device. The vehicle is then set to motion.<br>
C.	Description of the invention<br>
The force required, to be applied, for tricycle to move is through human effort and weight, which is just sufficient to overcome the static fiiction of road resistance. The speed attained is about 15-km/hr. For increasing this speed twice or thrice, speed increasing device can be provided but that will increase the requirement of more effort. This effort will be very much higher than that of humanly possible.<br>
The load lifting machines can be effectively utilized to move the vehicles. A load lifting machine is connected to the vehicle in the manner described as under. When an effort is applied to the load lifting machine, part of weight of vehicle is getting shifted to the input of speed increasing device whose output to input gear ratio is more than one. When the major part of weight of vehicle lift-effected is equal to the virtually increased fiiction of road resistance caused due to the remaining part of weight of vehicle and the<br><br>
effort, the vehicle is set to motion. Here in this arrangement of load lifting machine instead of load being lifted, the fixed support pulls down or rotates the speed increasing device.<br>
In fig (i), when an effort is applied on the pedal (3), the movable part of load lifting machine (4) tries to pull up the vehicle through the hook (1) with respect to the shaft (6) that acts as a fixed support. This shaft is fixed on the circumference of driving sprocket (7). Its initial support will be very high because of high virtually increased firiction of road resistance.<br>
Weight of vehicle on the point of contact on road gradually reduces and gets shifted on the shaft. This tends the road resistance to decrease, which in turn reduces the virtually increased fiiction of road resistance from very high value.<br>

As this fixed pulley block is suspended from the shaft (6) fixed on the circumference of driving sprocket (7) its initial support will be very high because of virtually increased fiiction of road resistance. As the load of vehicle is connected to the movable pulley (1), the majority of weight of the vehicle is equally shared by effort and the fixed pulley block (5). This reduces the virtually increased fiiction of road resistance tending the shaft (6) to move down and hence the vehicle is set to motion.<br>
In fig (iii) the fixed pulley (4) finds very high resistance for its rotation because of virtually increased fiiction of road resistance due to speed increasing device. When an effort is applied on the crank sprocket (3) the effort side of chain (2) tries to pull up the movable pulley (1) with respect to that part of chain passing over the fixed pulley.

(4).<br>
In fig (ix), application of effort on effort gear (2) rotates it anticlockwise. The load gear (1) tries to rotate clockwise, but finds very high resistance due to virtually increased fiiction of road resistance on the teeth of driving gear (7).
