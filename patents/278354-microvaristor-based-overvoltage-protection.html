DESCRIPTION<br>
Microvaristor-based overvoltage protection<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The invention relates to the field of overvoltage protec¬tion in electric and/or electronic circuitry, such as pro¬tection against lightning, electromagnetic pulses, switch¬ing surges or ground loop transients or electrostatic dis¬charge (ESD) protection. The invention relates, in par¬ticular, to nonlinear electrical materials and devices for such purposes. The invention is based on the method for producing an overvoltage protection means, the overvoltage protection means and the electric device comprising such overvoltage protection means according to the preamble of the independent claims.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention starts from the prior art as described in the article by F. Greuter et al., "Microvaristors: Functional Fillers for Novel Electroceramic Composites", J. Electro-ceramics, 13, 739-744 (2004). Therein, varistor composites containing ZnO microvaristors embedded in a polymer matrix are disclosed for electrostratic discharge (ESD) protec¬tion of electronics. The ZnO microvaristor particles show strong nonlinearities of their electrical resistance as a function of the applied electric field. The nonlinear be¬haviour of the composite material depends on the micro¬varistor particle nonlinearities, on their packing ar¬rangement and on the microscopic properties of the parti¬cle-particle contacts. The polymer is indispensably needed to disperse the microvaristor particles and to mold them as a viscous composite to the electronic element. After molding the composite has a macroscopic thickness and the<br>
 <br>
dispersed microvaristor particles occupy a three-dimensio¬nal volume in the composite, are arranged randomly in the composite volume and form random contacts in the volume with each other. The free space between the microvaristors is filled by the polymer.<br>
In the U. S. Pat. No. 6,239,687 Bl, as in references cited therein, a nonlinear resistance material (VVRM) is used to construct variable voltage protection devices for protect¬ing electronic circuits. The device comprises a reinfor¬cing layer, which is impregnated with the VVRM and has a predetermined thickness, such that the device has a uni¬form thickness and thus reprocible electrical peformance. The thickness may be controlled to macroscopic dimensions by spacers such as ceramic or glass spheres.<br>
BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is a general object of the invention to provide an overvoltage protection means, that has favourable nonlin¬ear electrical properties and is easy to manufacture, an electric element comprising such a protection means, and a method for producing the overvoltage protection means. This object is achieved according to the invention by the subject-matter as set forth in the independent claims.<br>
In a first aspect, an overvoltage protection means for protecting electrical elements is claimed, the protection means comprising microvaristor particles, wherein single microvaristor particles are placed in an arrangement hav¬ing a monolayer thickness and are electrically coupled to the electrical element to protect the electrical element against overvoltages.<br>
In a second aspect, a method is claimed for producing an overvoltage protection means for protecting electrical elements, the protection means comprising microvaristor particles, wherein single microvaristor particles are pla¬ced in an arrangement having a monolayer thickness and are<br>
 <br>
are electrically coupled to the electrical element to pro¬tect the electrical element against overvoltages.<br>
The method of placing instead of molding, pouring or cast¬ing microvaristor particles allows to design overvoltage protection means for electric and electronic circuitry with an unprecedented level of precision. Thereby over-voltage protection is made more reliable and effective also on a microscopic level and, in particular, for pro¬tecting parts or elements in electronic circuits. Further¬more, the flexibility in integration of varistor overvolt¬age protection means in miniaturized electric or elec¬tronic equipment is strongly improved.<br>
Mono-layered microvaristor particles allow to build high-performance overvoltage protection systems with much lower capacitance than previously known bulk varistor ceramic or composite protection means. This is due to the fact that the monolayer arrangement allows for the first time to profit from the discrete nature of the microvaristor par¬ticles which provide discrete contacting points among each other and with the electric elements to be protected. Within the monolayer the microvaristors can be placed side by side, but not on top of each other.<br>
In preferred embodiments variants of monolayer arrange¬ments are disclosed, such as two-dimensional and/or one-dimensional arrangements, and/or arrangements as monolayer spacers between conductors. The great flexibility in par¬ticle placement allows to adapt the geometry of the monolayer arrangement to any desired shape of the systems to be protected. The monolayer shapes may comprise, e.g., curved or bent, completely or partially covered planes or strings or combinations thereof or virtually any desired shape of monolayer thickness.<br>
In further preferred embodiments variants of carriers for particle placement are disclosed, such as planar and/or longitudinal extended carriers, and/or structured carriers for providing individual placement sites for single micro-<br>
 <br>
varistor particles. The carriers may be decorated with guiding structures for holding the particles in place. The carriers may comprise adhesive layers to form sticky tapes, and/or may comprise fixation means for fixing the microvaristor monolayer to the tape.<br>
In further preferred embodiments electrical coupling means, which may be conductive, anisotropically conduc¬tive, semiconductive or insulating, are provided for elec¬trically coupling the monolayer arrangement to an active part and a reference-potential part of the electrical com¬ponent or assembly to be protected.<br>
In a third aspect, an electrical device comprising an electrical element having such an overvoltage protection means is claimed. The electrical element may comprise a passive element, such as a conductor, wiring, connector, electrical component, e.g. socket or plug, capacitor, in¬ductance or resistor, and/or an active element, such as an electronic element, IC chip, or switch. The electrical element may also comprise an electrical circuit, elec¬tronic circuit, RF circuit, printed circuit, printed cir¬cuit board, antenna, circuit line, I/O port, or chip.<br>
Further embodiments, advantages and applications of the invention will become apparent from claims or claim combi¬nations and when consideration is given to the following detailed description and the figures.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OP THE INVENTION<br>
Overvoltage protection means for protecting electrical elements 6, 6b, 6c, 6d, 6e, 8, 9, 11-13 are disclosed, wherein the protection means comprise microvaristor parti¬cles 2. According to invention, single microvaristor par¬ticles 2 are placed in an arrangement 1 having a monolayer thickness t and are electrically coupled to the electrical element 6, 6b, 6c, 6d, 6e, 8, 9, 11-13 to protect the electrical element 6, 6b, 6c, 6d, 6e, 8, 9, 11-13 against overvoltages. In the following exemplary embodiments, en¬compassing, as well, the corresponding method steps for producing the overvoltage protection means, are presented.<br>
Fig. 1 shows a current-voltage characteristic typical for varistor materials. Like well-known bulk varistor ceramics or varistor compounds, a microvaristor particle shows such a nonlinear behaviour of voltage versus current. Thus the microvaristor has a high resistance in normal operation and reacts almost instantaneously to overvoltages by switching into a low resistance state.<br>
As shown in Fig. 2a-2i the single microvaristors 2 can be arranged in a two-dimensional arrangement 1; 4a-4d (Fig. 2a-2d) of monolayer thickness t, in particular in a plane; and/or the single microvaristors 2 are arranged along a one-dimensional or string-like arrangement 1; 4a',<br>
 <br>
4b" of monolayer thickness t, in particular in a string 1; 4a' extended linearly (Fig. 2e) and/or bent 1; 4b' along a conductor surface 6b, 6c (Fig. 5b).<br>
The single microvaristors 2 can be arranged such that they form low-capacitance coupling points and, in particular, point-like coupling points with the electrical element 6, 6b, 6c, 6d, 6e, 8, 9, 11-13 to be protected. For exam¬ple, single microvaristors 2 are arranged such that they are in direct lateral contact (Fig. 2a-2e) and/or are separated from each other by an interstitial medium 41g, 41h (Fig. 2f-2i), such as an insulating, semiconductive or conductive medium 41g, 41h. Preferably, single micro¬varistors 2 are electrically coupled and, in particular, electrically connected, to one or several neighbouring mi-crovaristor (s) 2.<br>
Fig. 2a-2i and Fig. 3a-3f show that favourably a carrier 3; 3a-3j, 3a' for placing the microvaristor particles (2) shall be present. The carrier 3 can be extended in a car¬rier plane 3a-3j and/or along a longitudinal shape, such as a groove 3a', edge or bent curve. The carrier 3; 3a-3j may comprise a conductive material, such as a metal, al¬loy, conductive ceramic or conductive polymer, and/or an insulating material, such as an insulating ceramic or in¬sulating polymer; and/or the carrier 3; 3a-3j may be a foil 3a-3c, 3i, plate 3a-3c, 3i, mesh 3d, foam 3j, or mul¬tilayer. Favourably, the carrier 3; 3a-3j has a structure comprising individual placement sites 4; 4a-4h for single microvaristor particles 2. Preferably, the carrier 3; 3a-3j has a structured surface, which, in particular, com¬prises grooves 4a, 4b, holes 4c, 4d, insulating gaps 40f, 40g, insulating barriers 41g, 41h, printed ducts, or a structured plate or multilayer 4a, 4b, 4c, 4g, 4h.<br>
As shown in Fig. 8a,	8b it is also possible that the<br>
carrier 3 covered with	the monolayer 1 of microvaristors 2<br>
has the function of	a structured substrate 7 for an<br>
electronic circuit 6.<br>
 <br>
As shown in Fig. 2f-2i, the carrier 3; 3a-3j can comprise guiding structures 40f, 40g, 41g, 41h for laterally and/or vertically holding the microvaristor particles 2. In par¬ticular, the guiding structures may comprise gaps 40f, 40g underneath or on top of the microvaristor particles 2 and/or barriers 41g, 41h between neighbouring microvaris¬tor particles 2.<br>
A tape 1, 3 can be formed by the monolayer microvaristor arrangement 1 backed by the carrier 3; 3a-3j, 3a'. Fig. 3f shows that the tape 1, 3, 5e may comprise an adhesive 53, in particular an adhesive layer 5e, applied to the micro¬varistor arrangement 1 or the microvaristor particles 2, in particular onto the microvaristor heads, for providing easy tape placement properties.<br>
As shown in Fig. 3a-3f, the microvaristor particles 2 can be fixed to the carrier 3; 3a-3j, 3a' by fixation means 5; 5a-5f and, in particular, by an adhesive 5a or a binder 5b, by pressing into a ductile carrier material 5c, by hot pressing into a thermoplastic carrier material 5c, by fus¬ing, soldering or sintering fixation 5d to the carrier 3/ 3a-3j, 3a', and/or by sealing with a thin film 5e, e.g. a polymer film 5e, onto the carrier 3; 3a-3j, 3a'. In par¬ticular, an adhesive 5a can be chosen to be conductive, anisotropically conductive, semiconductive, insulating, or is applied in a determined structure, for example by printing techniques, and in particular in a layer. As an alternative to fixation means, the microvaristor particles 2 can be pressed onto the carrier 3; 3a-3j, 3a'.<br>
Fig. 4-6 show examples where single microvaristors 2 are arranged between a signal conductor 6b, 6c, 6d, 6e, 8, 9, 13 and a conductor 10 on a reference potential, preferably a conductor 10 on a fixed-reference potential, particu¬larly preferred a conductor 10 on earth potential. The conductors 6b, 6c, 6d, 6e; 8, 9, 10, 13 can be coated with conducting and/or semiconductive and/or insulating mate¬rial. As shown in Fig. 5b-5d single microvaristors 2 can<br>
 <br>
be arranged as a spacer between conductors 6b, 6c, 6d, 6e. In particular, single microvaristors 2 can be present in a cylindrical arrangement 1; 4b' between coaxial conductor cylinders 6b, 6c, in a single-sided or double-sided layer 1 on a band conductor 6d, or in spacer layers 1 between band conductors 6d, 6e in a multilayer arrangement 2, 6d, 6e.<br>
The arrangement 1 of monolayer thickness t shall be elec¬trically coupled, in particular connected, to an active part 6b, 6c, 6d, 6e, 8, 9, 11-13 and a reference-potential part 10 of the electrical component or element 6, 6b, 6c, 6d, 6e, 8, 9, 11-13 or of an assembly or device comprising the electrical element 6, 6b, 6cr   6d, 6e, 8, 9, 11-13.<br>
Fig. 7a-7f show examples of electrical coupling means 14; 14a-14e for effecting the desired electric coupling, in¬cluding galvanic, resistive, capacitive and inductive cou¬pling, with the lead 8 and/or the ground 10. Thus the cou¬pling means 14/ 14a-14e may comprise a conductive layer 14a, printed, evaporated or soldered conductive contacts 14b, an insulating/conductive bi-layer 14a, 14c, a conduc¬tive/insulating bi-layer 14c, 14a, a binder 14d, and/or a conductive, anisotropically conductive, semiconductive or insulating adhesive 14e and, in particular adhesive layer 14e (Fig. 8b) . Such coupling means 14; 14a-14e can be ar¬ranged underneath and/or on top of the microvaristor par¬ticles 2.<br>
A particular application is given in Fig. 8a, 8b, where the overvoltage protection means is arranged on top of or underneath a conductor path 6b that has a constriction 15 for providing a fuse 15.<br>
A preferable choice for the microvaristor particles 2 can be selected by the following criteria: the particles 2 may comprise doped ZnO and/or doped SnO and/or doped SiC and/or doped SrTi03; and/or the particles 2 may be essentially spherical or essentially hemispherical, and in particular shall have similar dimensions, preferably from some urn to some hundred urn with an upper limit of<br>
 <br>
approximately 1 mm, and are preferably selected from a narrow sieving fraction; and/or the particles 2 have a platelet shape; and/or they have similar thickness; and/or they are produced by cutting, breaking and/or punching from a casted green body before or after sintering, wherein the green body is preferably tape-casted, strip-casted, extruded and/or printed, e.g. screen printed; and/or the particles 2 are produced by granulation, calcination and light breaking-up; and/or the particles 2 are decorated with metal flakes of smaller dimensions than the microvaristor dimensions. EP 0 992 042, herewith en¬closed in its entirety in this application, discloses that such electrically conductive particles can be fused to the surface of the microvaristor particles to form direct electrical low resistance contacts between the microvaris¬tor particles.<br>
In a further aspect, the invention relates to an electri¬cal device, comprising an electrical element 6, 6b, 6c, 6d, 6e, 8, 9, 11-13 having an overvoltage protection means, wherein the protection means comprise microvaristor particles 2, which are placed in an arrangement 1 having a monolayer thickness t and are electrically coupled to the electrical element 6, 6b, 6c, 6d, 6e, 8, 9, 11-13 to pro¬tect the electrical element 6, 6b, 6c, 6d, 6e, 8, 9, 11-13 against overvoltages. The overvoltage protection means can be designed as discussed in the aforementioned embodi¬ments. In particular, as shown in Fig. 4, the monolayered overvoltage protection tape, foil or plate 1 can simply be applied or pressed against the input lead 8 of the electric device 6 to be protected, thereby saving valuable surface of the device or IC substrate 7.<br>
In particular, as shown in Fig. 4-6 and Fig. 8-9, the ar¬rangement 1 of monolayer thickness t can be present be¬tween an active part 6b, 6c, 6d, 6e, 8, 9, 11-13 and a grounded part 10 of the electrical element 6, 6b, 6c, 6d, 6e, 8, 9, 11-13 or of the electrical device; and/or the electrical element 6, 6b, 11-13 may comprise a passive<br>
 <br>
element, such as a conductor 6b, 6c, 6d, 6e, wiring 8, connector 11, electrical component 12, 13, e.g. socket 13 or plug 12, capacitor, inductance or resistor, and/or an active element, such as an electronic element, IC chip 6, or switch; and/or the electrical device may comprise an electrical circuit, electronic circuit, RF circuit, printed circuit, printed circuit board 7, antenna, circuit line, I/O port, or chip 6.<br>
In another aspect, the invention relates to a method for producing an overvoltage protection means for protecting electrical elements 6, 6b, 6c, 6d, 6e, 8, 9, 11-13, wherein the protection means comprise microvaristor parti¬cles 2. According to invention, single microvaristor par¬ticles 2 are placed in an arrangement 1 having a monolayer thickness t and are electrically coupled to the electrical element 6, 6b, 6c, 6d, 6e, 8, 9, 11-13 to protect the electrical element 6, 6b, 6c, 6d, 6e, 8, 9, 11-13 against overvoltages.<br>
Exemplary embodiments of the production method relate to the features of the overvoltage protection means disclosed above and are claimed in the dependent claims 2-14, ac¬cordingly- Here only selected exemplary method embodiments are rementioned.<br>
With respect to Fig. 2-3, single microvaristors 2 are placed on a carrier 3; 3a-3j, 3a', and, in particular, on a planar extended carrier 3; 3a-3j in the carrier plane and/or along a longitudinally extended carrier 3; 3a', such as a groove, edge or bent curve 3a'. Preferably, the carrier 3; 3a-3j, 3a' shall be structured such that individual placement sites 4; 4a-4h for single microvaris¬tor particles 2 are provided for. In particular, the car¬rier 3; 3a-3j, 3a' can be structured by means of etching, punching, lasering, printing, drilling, evaporation and/or sputtering, e.g.. In addition, guiding structures 40f, 40g, 41g, 41h for laterally and/or vertically holding the microvaristor particles 2 can be applied onto or into the<br>
 <br>
carrier 3; 3a-3j. Such guiding structures 40f, 40g, 41g, 41h can be made of an insulating and/or semiconductive and/or conducting material, in particular of a polymer or a metal; and/or the guiding structures 40f, 40g, 41g, 41h can be applied onto the carrier 3; 3a-3j, 3a' by printing or sputtering, e.g..<br>
Furthermore, an insulating adhesive 5e, in particular ad¬hesive layer 5e, can be placed over the microvaristor ar¬rangement 1 or microvaristor particles 2, in particular the microvaristor top sides, for providing a sticky tape 1, 3, 5e with easy placement properties; and/or a conduc¬tive adhesive or adhesive layer 5e can be applied onto the microvaristor arrangement 1, in particular by printing, spraying or roll on, for providing a sticky tape 1, 3, 5e with easy placement and favourable contacting properties. The adhesive or adhesive layer 5e can be made from the group of epoxies, silicones and (poly)urethanes. It can comprise a thermoplastic or a duromer.<br>
The monolayered tape 1, 3 containing a monolayer of mi-crovaristors 2 compares favourably in many respects with conventional tapes based on voluminous polymer-embedded microvaristor particles. The nonlinearity of each mi¬crovaristor particle 2 is an effect produced by its built-in grain boundaries. Owing to the monolayer arrangement 1 the overall nonlinear behaviour of the tape 1, 3 is deter¬mined by and in fact equal to the microvaristor particle nonlinearity.<br>
The tape 1, 3 can be a flexible tape, preferably with at least one surface being self-adhesive, for applying the tape on electrical components. The tape 1, 3 can prefera¬bly be applied in electric or electronic components and provides overvoltage protection by means of its monolayer arrangement of microvaristor particles 2. With respect to the tape 1, 3, the substrate or carrier 3 can be in the form of a sheet and preferably a band.<br>
 <br>
Fixation of the microvaristor particles 2 can be effected by pressing them onto the carrier 3; 3a-3j, 3a". The mi¬crovaristor particles 2 can also be fixed to the carrier 3; 3a-3j, 3a' by fixation means 5; 5a-5f, and, in particu¬lar, by applying an adhesive 5a or a binder 5b, by press¬ing the microvaristors 2 into a ductile carrier material 5c, by hot pressing the microvaristors 2 into a thermo¬plastic carrier material 5c, by fusing, ultrasonic fusing, microwave fusing, soldering, sintering or laser sintering the microvaristors 2 to the carrier 3; 3a-3j, 3a', by coating or spraying metallic flakes and/or nano-particles onto the carrier 3; 3a-3j, 3a' prior to fusion, soldering or sintering in order to improve adhesion and/or contacting, and/or by sealing the microvaristors 2 with a thin film 5e, e.g. a polymer film 5e, onto the carrier 3; 3a-3j, 3a .<br>
Monolayer arrangements 1 of microvaristor particles 2 al-low to build overvoltage protection means that have re-duced capacitance which benefits high frequency applica-tions .<br>
