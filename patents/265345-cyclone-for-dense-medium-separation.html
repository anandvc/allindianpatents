FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a cyclone for dense medium separation<br>
adaptable to be used in the dense medium separation of a fine coal (-2<br>
+0.25mm) fraction. More particularly, the invention relates to a cyclone for<br>
dense medium separation that has been developed to minimize turbulence within<br>
the cyclone during the separation process.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The flow behaviour of slurries within cyclones is quite complex. This has led<br>
designers to rely on empirical equations for predicting performance of cyclones.<br>
These empirical relationships are derived from an analysis of experimental data<br>
and include the effect of operational and geometric variables. Different sets of<br>
experimental data lead to different equations for the same basic parameters.<br>
However, these empirical models suffer from the inherent deficiency of any<br>
empirical model. That is, the model can only be used within the limits of the<br>
experimental data from which the model parameters were determined. In view<br>
of this shortcoming, mathematical models based on fluid mechanics are highly<br>
desirable.<br>
The numerical technique "Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD)" herein means<br>
the numerical treatment of the Navier-Stokes equations over a<br>
structured/unstructured 3D grid within a cyclone body. Turbulence modeling is<br>
achieved by both RSM (Reynolds Stress Model) and LES (Large Eddy<br>
Simulations) in order to capture the high swirling flow patterns seen in dense<br>
medium cyclones. CFD provides a means of predicting velocity profiles under a<br>
wide range of development and operating condition. The numerical treatment of<br><br>
3<br>
the Navier-Stokes equations, the basic of any CFD technique, crept into the<br>
analysis of cyclone behaviour in the early 1980s . This resulted from the rapid<br>
improvement in computers at that time and a better understanding of the<br>
numerical treatment of turbulence.<br>
The expression "fine coal dense medium separation process" herein means<br>
separation of a fine coal material into dense and less high gravity fraction at a<br>
predetermined cut point. In the process the particulate material is carried in a<br>
dense liquid medium which typically comprises a mixture of water and particles<br>
of dense material such as ultra fine magnetite.<br>
At present, the dense medium cyclone (DMC) is one of the best pieces of<br>
processing equipment for washing coal of -20+0.5mm size. Difficult washing<br>
characteristics associated with, for example, many Indian coals are generally due<br>
to the present of a high proportion of near-gravity material (NGM). This makes<br>
the DFC an obvious choice for most Indian washiers. In order to produce low<br>
ash clean coal from run-of-mine (ROM) coal, it is necessary to crush the ROM to<br>
fine sizes to liberate ash &amp; coal. One of the more efficient methods of<br>
beneficiating the generated intermediate size fraction (-2+0.25 mm) fines is<br>
dense medium operation is small diameter cyclones.<br>
A known prior art dense medium cyclone is illustrated in figure 1. This<br>
conventional dense medium cyclone 10 includes a cylindrical inlet chamber 11<br>
into which a mixture of medium and raw coal enters tangentially through an<br>
inlet 12, thus forming a strong vertical flow. The refuse or high ash particles<br>
move along the wall 13 of the cyclone due to the centrifugal force, where the<br>
velocity is the least and is discharged through the underflow orifice 14 or spigot.<br>
The lighter washer coal moves towards the longitudinal axis 15 of the cyclone<br><br>
4<br>
due to the drag force where a high velocity zone exists and passes through an<br>
overflow orifice or vortex finder 16,also sometimes termed an overflow chamber.<br>
With cyclone of this type, entrainment of fine or slower settling particles occurs<br>
in the void spaces between the coarser, or faster settling, particles discharged as<br>
the underflow. Turbulence fluctuation inside the cyclone are also expected to be<br>
significant due to the collision of the inlet stream with the rotating stream. Due<br>
to inadequate standard inlet and body section design, these cyclones are<br>
associated with large short-circuit flow and short residence time of the internal<br>
upward flow. The through put and performance is limited by the flow through<br>
the axial outlet. For many applications therefore, cyclones of this type are<br>
operated at a reduced feed rate, in order to obtain the required cut between the<br>
low gravity fraction and high gravity fraction.<br>
There us need to develop a new design for a DMC for the recovery of clean coal<br>
ash (
particularly advantageous if a dense medium cyclone having increased efficiency<br>
could be devised that is able to produce a product with reduced ash content. It<br>
would also be advantageous if a dense medium cyclone could be devised having<br>
an increased ability to separate out fine particles efficiently.<br>
A new improved development of DMC for efficient coal separation emphasizing a<br>
fines fraction of -2 +0.25 mm has been development using a comprehensive<br>
CFD model. In particular, a CFD model of the DMC which is capable of<br>
predicting the performance of the cyclone has been developed, using Fluent, by<br>
coupling component models for the air-core, the magnetite medium Lagrangian<br>
particle tracking for particles ranging in size from 0.25 to 2 mm. This has<br>
resulted in the invention described below.<br><br>
5<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is therefore, an object of the present invention to propose CFD cyclone for<br>
dense medium separation of a fine coal, which eliminates the disadvantages of<br>
prior Art.<br>
Another objection of the present invention is to propose CFD cyclone for dense<br>
medium separation of a fine coal, which is capable of predicting the performance<br>
of a cyclone and has been developed using fluent by coupling component models<br>
for the air-core, the magnetite medium and coal particles.<br>
A further object of the present invention is to propose CFD cyclone for dense<br>
medium separation of a fine coal, which separates fine coal particles by<br>
enhancing residence time of fine coal particles and minimising recirculation zone<br>
inside the cyclone.<br>
A still further object of the present invention is to propose CFD cyclone for dense<br>
medium separation of a fine coal, which minimizes short-circuiting and<br>
recirculation zones inside the cyclone.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention advantageously provides am improve dense medium<br>
cyclone model which it is believed will exhibit an improved throughput relative to<br>
conventional cyclones for fine coal beneficiation.<br>
According to one aspect of the invention there is provided a cyclone for dense<br>
medium separation including.<br><br>
6<br>
a cyclone body that defines an interior space having an inner wall surface;<br>
a vortex finder including a lower end that extends longitudinally into upper<br>
region of the interior space of the cyclone body;<br>
region of the interior space of the cyclone body;<br>
an overflow outlet associated with an upper end of the vortex finder;<br>
a feed inlet that is in fluid communication with the upper region of the<br>
interior space of the cyclone body; and<br>
an outlet associated with a lower region of the interior space;<br>
wherein the inner wall surface of the interior space curves inwardly and<br>
downwardly from the upper region of the interior space to the lower<br>
region of the interior space.<br>
According to CFD predictions, in conventional dense medium cyclone (as<br>
illustrated in Figurel) a very high turbulent kinetic energy exists near the tip of<br>
vortex finer. As expected, the sudden transition from a cylindrical section to a<br>
conical section result in a clear source of turbulent fluctuations downwards<br>
through the cyclone body. These fluctuations usually propagate a very high<br>
turbulent kinetic energy near the bottom of the apex zone. Modifying the<br>
cylindrical-conical shape of the conventional DMC to a rounded wall design as<br>
described in the immediately preceding paragraph advantageously alleviates or<br>
avoids turbulent fluctuations due to separation at the intersection of cylindrical<br>
conical sections. Further, throughput in the design of the invention is<br>
advantageously high compared to the conventional cyclones described above.<br>
Furthermore, it is anticipated that the rounded wall design may significantly<br>
increase the residence time of fine particles within the cyclone which would be<br>
advantageous as would be appreciated by those in the art.<br><br>
7<br>
The curvature of the inner wall surface of the interior space preferable extends<br>
substantially along the longitudinal length of the cyclone body. More particularly,<br>
in a preferred embodiment the degree of curvature of the inner wall surface of<br>
the interior space in longitudinal direction continuously increases from a lower<br>
end of the vortex finder to the lower region of the interior space. More<br>
preferable the associated with the lower region of the interior space.<br>
The degree of curvature of the inner wall surface is not particularly limited and<br>
may vary from case to case. However, in a particular embodiment, the curvature<br>
of the inner surface of the interior space increase from about 1 degree at the<br>
point immediately below the feed inlet to about 20 degree at the outlet.<br>
According to a particular embodiment of the invention, the vortex finder is<br>
provided with an outer surface that tapers outwardly and downwardly into the<br>
upper region of the interior space along the longitudinal axis of the cyclone body.<br>
The degree of the taper of the outer surface of the vortex finder according to<br>
this embodiment of the invention is not particularly limited. However, it is<br>
preferred that the outer surface of the vortex finder tapers outwardly and<br>
downwardly at 9 degree from the longitudinally axis of the cyclone body.<br>
The overflow outlet may be positioned as desired relative to the lower end<br>
thereof that extends longitudinally into the upper region of the interior space of<br>
the cyclone body.<br>
Generally it is prepared that the overflow outlet is disposed on the upper end of<br>
the vortex finder and in alignment with the longitudinal axis of the cyclone body.<br><br>
8<br>
The feed inlet may take any suitable configuration. In a preferred embodiment,<br>
however, the feed inlet includes an involute conduit that extends around a<br>
portion of the circumference of an upper end of the cyclone body. More<br>
particularly, the involute conduit preferable extends horizontally along the<br>
circumference of the upper end of the cyclone body and includes a rear wall that<br>
curves inwardly and that is coterminous with an inner wall surface of the upper<br>
end of the cyclone body.<br>
The upper region of the interior space may be in the form of substantially<br>
cylindrical barrel that extends up to 1.23 Dc from the top of the cyclone body,<br>
compared to 0.67 Dc in conventional cyclones. The substantially cylindrical<br>
barrel merges with and into the more rounded inner wall surface of the interior<br>
space of the cyclone for handling higher throughputs compared with<br>
conventional cyclones. The overall length of the cyclone is generally about 3.23-<br>
3.5 Dc which is effectively 1.23 m for a 350mm cyclone is generally about 3.23-<br>
3.5 Dc which is effectively 1.23 m for a 350mm cyclone.<br>
The improved inlet design described above, including the preferred form for the<br>
vortex finder and the preferred form for the feed inlet, advantageously makes it<br>
conceptually possible to minimize short-circuiting of the high gravity fraction into<br>
the overflow. Further, this design advantageously provides high centrifugal<br>
forces in the upper region of the interior space of the cyclone body.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF A PREFERRED EMBODIMENT OF THE<br>
INVENTION<br>
Referring to Figures 2A and 2B, a cyclone20 is illustrated that includes a cyclone<br>
body 21 define by a cyclone body wall 22. The cyclone body wall 22 has an<br>
inner wall surface 23 that defines an interior space 24 within which the<br>
separation process takes place.<br>
A vortex finder 25 extends into an upper region 26 of the interior space 24 of the<br>
cyclone body 21. The vortex finder 25 is axially orientated and includes an<br>
overflow outlet 27 that is associated with its upper end.<br><br>
10<br>
A feed inlet 28 is provided that is in fluid communication with the region 26 of<br>
the interior space 24. The feed inlet is involute, as best seen in figure 2B, in that<br>
wall 29 of the feed inlet 28 is curved and coterminous with the inner wall surface<br>
23 at an upper end 35 of the cyclone body 21. The feed inlet 28 provides a<br>
means for the introduction of a fluid stream into the interior space 26 and will be<br>
discussed in more detail below.<br>
A spigot 30 in provided in a lower region 31 of the interior space 24 and provides<br>
an axially directed outlet 32 for removing fluid and high density material from the<br>
cyclone body 21. The diameter of the spigot 30 of the lower 31 may be<br>
determined using the application of normal cyclone design criteria.<br>
The inner wall surface 23 of the cyclone body wall 22 curves inwardly and<br>
downwardly substantially along the length of the cyclone body21. The inner wall<br>
surface 23 typically curves inwardly downwardly from the bottom of the feed<br>
inlet 28 to the spigot 30 at a continuously changing cone angle of from 1° to 20°<br>
relative to the longitudinal axis 33 of the cyclone body 21. The converging<br>
rounded nature of the inner wall surface 23 is though to be important in<br>
generating appropriate helical fluid flow pattern through the interior space 24 of<br>
the cyclone body 21 to achieve a desired degree of separation.<br>
The smaller angles in the upper region 26 of the interior 24 are thought to be<br>
important when dealing with separation involving fine particles, for example of<br>
less that 2mm. Angles of close to 20° near the spigot 30 in the lower region 31<br>
of the interior space 24 are thought to avoid surging if any occurs, at high<br>
throughput rates.<br><br>
11<br>
It is believed that the design of the invention will therefore permit a greater<br>
volume of high gravity fraction to pass through the outlet 32 compared with<br>
conventional cyclones as briefly described above.<br>
As noted above, the vortex finder 25 extends substantially axially into the upper<br>
region 26of the interior space 24 of the cyclone body 21. The vortex finder 25<br>
defines an overflow outlet 27 which removes fluid and entrained particles from<br>
the cyclone. The vortex finder 25 terminates with an internal end 34 which is<br>
positioned at least a minimum distance below the feed inlet 28 of the cyclone 20.<br>
The upper region 26 of the interior space 24 defined between the inner wall<br>
surface 23 at the upper end 35 of the cyclone body 21 and the vortex finder 25<br>
forms a feed zone of the cyclone 20.<br>
Referring to the feed zone of the cyclone 20, the inner wall surface23 at the<br>
upper end 35 of the cyclone body 21 extending from the top of the cyclone body<br>
21 to the just below the feed inlet 28 tapers inwardly and downwardly at an<br>
angle of typically 6°. The vortex finder 25 includes an outer wall 36 that tapers<br>
outwardly and downwardly towards its internal end 34. The illustrated vortex<br>
finder 7 tapers outwardly towards at an angle of 9° relative to a longitudinal axis<br>
of the cyclone body 21.<br>
The combination of inward taper of the inner wall surface 23 at the upper end 35<br>
of the cyclone body 21, a curved portion of the inner wall 36 of the vortex finder<br>
25 creates a feed zone of decreasing cross section area from the feed inlet 28<br>
down to the internal end 34 of the vortex finder 25. This has the effect of<br>
accelerating the fluid and entrained medium and coal particles through this<br>
region, thereby increasing centrifugal forces. Furthermore, the outer wall 36 of<br>
the vortex finder 25 is spaced a reasonable distance radially outwardly relative to<br><br>
12<br>
the overflow outlet 27 of the vortex finder 25. This also has the effect of<br>
decreasing the cross sectional area of the feed zone for fluid flow between the<br>
inner wall surface 23 and the outer wall 36 of the vortex finder 25.<br>
The feed inlet 28, in more detail, includes an aperture through which feed is<br>
introduced and an involute conduit 38 that extends around a portion of the<br>
upper end 35 of the cyclone body 21. The involute conduit 38, at its outer wall<br>
29, tapers inwardly as is shown in the drawings. Again, this has the effect of<br>
accelerating the feed as it centers the cyclone body 21.<br>
Generally, the ration of diameters d1: d2 is about 2.25. It will be appreciated,<br>
however, that the size and configuration of the inlet conduit 38 and associated<br>
conduit opening 37 may typically be determined depending on the application on<br>
the application to which the cyclone is being put according to tradition design<br>
criteria.<br>
In use, a fluid stream containing entrained coal particles enters via the opening<br>
37 of the inlet 28 under pressure and flows helically down the cyclone body 21<br>
towards the underflow outlet 32. The acceleration of the fluid and entrained coal<br>
particles through the feed zone acts to reduce short circuiting flow direct to the<br>
overflow outlet 27.<br>
The rapid swirling flow of the fluid has the effect of displacing relatively heavier<br>
particles towards radially outer positions in the interior space 24 of the cyclone<br>
body 21, proximate to the cyclone body wall 22. Relatively lighter particles are<br>
displaced to a radially inner position in the interior space 24. As a result, the<br>
heavier particles tend to exit the cyclone via the underflow outlet 32.<br><br>
13<br>
A rapidly swirling core of air moves upwardly from the underflow outlet 32<br>
through a central region of the interior space 24 towards the vortex finder 25<br>
where it exits via the overflow outlet 27. This swirling core of air which very<br>
unstable carries with it the relatively lighter particles.<br>
The medium used for the dense media cyclone 20 depends on the actual mineral<br>
separation being effected within the cyclone 20. For the treatment of fine coal,<br>
ultrafine magnetite is typically used, for example having from 95% -99% of<br>
particles below 53 micron<br>
Typically, the cyclone according to the invention will have a diameter in the<br>
range of 100mm -350mm. By the term "cyclone diameter" is meant the<br>
diameter of the cyclone body 21 at the upper end 35 of the upper wall portion.<br>
Numerical experimental and pilot plant cyclones typically have a diameter of<br>
350mm.<br>
Generally, in a 350mm diameter diameter cyclone the total length is 1.2m, which<br>
equates to 3.5 Dc. These sorts of cyclones are suitable for fine particle<br>
separation where there is a high content of near gravity materials due t their<br>
inherently high residence time of neutrally buoyant particles.<br>
EXPERIMENTAL RESULT<br>
In these comparative tests, a DSM (Dutch State Mine) cyclone was tested against<br>
the CFD dense media cyclone of the invention.<br><br>
14<br>
A virtual test cyclone of 350 mm diameter, with an angle 20 degree slanted to<br>
the horizontal plane and a dense medium made of ultra fine quality was used for<br>
the simulations. The feed pressure to the cyclone used in simulations was in the<br>
rage of 1 to 1.5 meter which is 9 to 13 times the cyclone diameter. The predicted<br>
overflow and under flow of the cyclone were noted and used for the calculation<br>
of product densities.<br>
At the end of each completed case. The turbulence analysis has been done<br>
before coal particle tracking process, to understand the flow structure and<br>
swirling patterns inside the cyclone.<br>
After each test case had been completed, the partition characteristics of the DMC<br>
were modeled using Lagrangian particle tracking for particles ranging in size<br>
from 0.25 to 2 mm. Partition numbers were calculated according to techniques<br>
well known in the art.<br>
The partition number (or coefficient) is basically an empirical measure of the<br>
average probability of the particles in the respective density fraction reporting to<br>
one or other of the products, for example to the cyclone underflow. The<br>
partition curve describes the partition number as a function of the particle<br>
densities. The efficiency of separation for a dense medium cyclone is usually<br>
represented by the Ep value, which is calculated as follow<br><br>
Where D75 is the density at which the probability of reporting to the underflow is<br>
75%, and D25 is the density at which the probability of reporting to the<br>
underflow is 25%.<br><br>
15<br>
The steeper the partition curve, or the smaller the Ep value, the better the<br>
separation. The partition curves for the experiments conducted are shown in<br>
Figure 6.<br>
The numerical experiments clearly demonstrate that the CFD cyclone delivers<br>
superior performance to the DSM cyclone.<br>
According to CFD predictions, as shown in Figure 4, it is interesting to note that<br>
in the conventional dense medium cyclone a very high turbulent kinetic energy<br>
exists near the tip of vortex finer. As expected, the sudden transition from the<br>
cylindrical body to the conical section is a clear source of turbulent fluctuations<br>
down the cyclone body. These fluctuations usually propagate a very high<br>
turbulent kinetic energy near the bottom of the apex zone. Modifying the<br>
cylindrical- conical shape to a curved wall design minimizes the turbulent<br>
fluctuation due to separation at the intersection of cylindrical-conical body.<br>
Further, the throughput is high in this conceptual design compared with the<br>
conventional cyclones.<br>
Certain embodiments of the CFD cyclone further provides an extended barrel<br>
length up to 3.25-3.5 Dc and this extended section mostly merged with rounded<br>
wall cyclone section. This arrangement provided an extra space for handling<br>
higher throughput compared to the convention cyclone.<br>
Also according to embodiments of the CFD cyclone there may be included an<br>
outside tapered (9 degrees) thick vortex finder. With improved inlet chamber<br>
design conceptually it is possible to minimize the short-circuiting of high gravity<br>
fraction into overflow. Further, this vortex finder design provides high<br>
centrifugal forces<br><br>
16<br>
The CFD predictions indicate that magnetic segregation is very significant in the<br>
conventional DSM cyclone compared to the CFD cyclone, as shown in Figure5.<br>
Unlike the conventional DSM cyclone, an almost uniform radial segregation of<br>
magnetic can be observed in the CFD cyclone. Hence the low density differential<br>
between overflow and underflows as provided in the table below.<br>
Table 1<br><br>
Cyclonedesign	Feeddensity,Kg/m^3	UnderflowDensity,kg/m^3	Feeddensity,Kg/m^3	Densitydifferentialkg/m^3<br>
DSM	1352	1762	1081	681<br>
CFD	1350	1580	1308	272<br>
It is observed that the CFD cyclone is able to separate fine coal particles (-<br>
2+0.25 mm) more sharply than conventional DSM design, with reference to<br>
Figure 6. A significant improvement in minimizing the short-circuiting to<br>
overflow observed in new design. Overall performance of the CFD cyclone<br>
design is much improved for the fine coal fraction compared to DSM design.<br>
This was attributed to minimization of turbulent fluctuations, flow reversals and<br>
short-circuiting flow.<br>
The CFD cyclone design produced a lower Ep and therefore a higher efficiency<br>
that the DSM design. The increase in efficiency was particularly pronounced for<br>
very fine particles (0.5 mm 0.25 mm). The lower density difference between<br>
overflow and underflow for the CFD cyclone indicates that uniform magnetite<br>
segregation is being generated inside the cyclone.<br><br>
17<br>
Dense medium cyclone play a critical role in the beneficiation of coals. Any<br>
increase in Separation efficiency of the equipment employed will avoid loss of<br>
coal particles in rejects. The CFD cyclone design is expected to increase the<br>
cyclone efficiency and thereby increase clean coal yields from washeries. The<br>
comparison of efficiency curve of the CFD cyclone design vis-a vis the<br>
conventional DSM design indicates a significant improvement in separation. Also,<br>
as the equipment is specially designed to treat intermediate size coal (-2+0.25<br>
mm) separately it enables a decrease in the overall ash content in the clean coal<br>
from the washeries. The lower ash in clean coal and, hence, lower coke ash is<br>
expected blast furnace productivity quite significantly.<br>
It will of course be realized that the above has been given only by way of<br>
illustrative example of the invention and that all such modification and variations<br>
thereto as would be apparent to those of skill in the art are deemed to fall within<br>
the broad scope and ambit of the invention as herein set forth.<br><br>

The present invention advantageously provides am improve dense medium<br>
cyclone model which it is believed will exhibit an improved throughput relative to<br>
conventional cyclones for fine coal beneficiation.<br>
According to one aspect of the invention there is provided a cyclone for dense<br>
medium separation including.<br><br>
6<br>
a cyclone body that defines an interior space having an inner wall surface;<br>
a vortex finder including a lower end that extends longitudinally into upper<br>
region of the interior space of the cyclone body;<br>
region of the interior space of the cyclone body;<br>
an overflow outlet associated with an upper end of the vortex finder;<br>
a feed inlet that is in fluid communication with the upper region of the<br>
interior space of the cyclone body; and<br>
an outlet associated with a lower region of the interior space;<br>
wherein the inner wall surface of the interior space curves inwardly and<br>
downwardly from the upper region of the interior space to the lower<br>
region of the interior space.<br>
According to CFD predictions, in conventional dense medium cyclone (as<br>
illustrated in Figurel) a very high turbulent kinetic energy exists near the tip of<br>
vortex finer. As expected, the sudden transition from a cylindrical section to a<br>
conical section result in a clear source of turbulent fluctuations downwards<br>
through the cyclone body. These fluctuations usually propagate a very high<br>
turbulent kinetic energy near the bottom of the apex zone. Modifying the<br>
cylindrical-conical shape of the conventional DMC to a rounded wall design as<br>
described in the immediately preceding paragraph advantageously alleviates or<br>
avoids turbulent fluctuations due to separation at the intersection of cylindrical<br>
conical sections. Further, throughput in the design of the invention is<br>
advantageously high compared to the conventional cyclones described above.</td>
