MICE ;   THIRTY   RUPEES<br><br><br><br>
The  present  invention  relates to an  improved method  of constructing  a borehole in an earth formation,  which borehole extends in a selected direction relative to an adjacent  borehole formed  in the earth formation.  In the industry  of  hydrocarbon exploration  and  production, drilling of two  or more  adjacent boreholes  can be desired to increase the production of oil  from one of the wellbores by injecting steam or water in the formation via  the  other  borehole.  When,  for  example,  the  production wellbore extends horizontally, it would be desirable to drill one or more injection boreholes parallel to the production  wellbore at a selected distance there below.  During oil production  steam is  injected in the formation via the injection borehole  thereby reducing  the  oil's flow resistance through  the  formation  and driving the oil towards the production wellbore.<br>
In US 3,725,777 a method for determining distance and direction to a cased borehole using magnetic field measurements made from an adjacent borehole is shown. For example in the case of attacking a blowout or drilling multiple wells from a single offshore platform it may be desirable to know the exact location of an existing well. Such an existing well or borehole is assumed to have a regular periodicity in the casing magnetization. By means of an iterative calculation the location of the previously drilled and cased borehole is determined. However, only a final approximate location of the existing well is obtained.<br><br>
In  EP-247672-A  a method  is disclosed  for  determining distance between adjacent boreholes.  The method of this document is  employed  in  case  of a blowout  in  a previously drilled wellbore,  whereby  a  so-called relief well  is  drilled,  which intersects  the blowing well at a selected depth so as  to  allow pumping  of heavy liquid into the blowing well.  In  this method accurate magnetic polestrengths values of casing portions have to be  known.  As a result of complex calculation on Fourier  Series of convoluted monopole- and dipole-field functions amplitude/wave number spectra are derived.  Such spectra allow determination  of the above distances.  Howver, to be capable to apply this  method and to obtain such spectra a large number of measurement data  is necessary resulting in only mean distances.<br>
Furthermore, from US 4,640,352 it is known to operate a couple of boreholes, the one used as a production well, the other as an injection well. The boreholes were substantially parallel and the problem addressed clearly concerned inducing an economically feasible production of oil from low permeable zones. However, from this document it is not clear how drilling and directing boreholes were carried out.<br>
As to the present invention a quite different problem has to be solved. It will be clear that in the case of a couple of boreholes it may be advantageous to have all the directional data of the adjacent borehole available as soon as the new borehole is to be drilled.<br><br>
However, it remains a problem how to control the direction of the borehole accurately and simultaneously to overcome the shortcomings and to avoid the complex operations of the methods as shown above.<br>
It is an object of the invention to provide an improved method of creating a borehole in an earth formation, in a selected direction relative to an adjacent borehoJe formed in the earth formation.<br>
It is another object of the invention to provide an improved system for creating a borehole in an earth formation, in a selected direction relative to an adjacent borehoJe formed in the earth formation.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides an improved method of constructing a borehole in an earth formation, in a selected direction relative to an adjacent borehole formed in the earth formation, the improvement comprising: drilling a section of the borehole; locating electromagnetic source means in a first of said boreholes at a plurality of locations along the length thereof for inducing an electromagnetic field extending into a second of said boreholes; locating electromagnetic field measuring means at a selected depth di in the second borehole for measuring said electromagnetic field; determining from the measured electromagnetic field, at least two components in directions substantially normal to the longitudinal axis of the first borehole; determining from said at least two components a direction parameter indicative of the direction of the borehole relative to the adjacent borehole; and drilling a further section of the borehole in a direction determined by the direction parameter.<br><br>
The two components of the electromagnetic field can be written as expressions being a function of the distance between depth di in the second borehole, and the first borehole. This distance can be written in terms of its components along said directions substantially normal to the longitudinal axis of the first borehole. By combining the expression for the two components of the electromagnetic field in a suitable manner, the components of the distance between the measuring means at depth di and the first borehole can be calculated. By determining these components at various depths di in the second borehole, the direction parameter can be calculated. It is to be understood that the electromagnetic field induced by the source means can have any suitable wavelength, and that a suitable electromagnetic field to be used in the invention forms a magnetic field induced by one or more permanent magnets.<br><br>
The borehole can be effectively created if the first borehole forms the adjacent borehole, and the second borehole forms the borehole which is being created.<br>
Preferably said directions of the at least two components are substantially perpendicular to each other, and the direction parameter is determined by determining a ratio of said two components.<br>
Determination of said ratio of the two components suitably comprises applying B1,i ./B2,i  - s1,i/s2,i ., whereby B1,i  and B2,i are<br>
the respective electromagnetic field strength components along said<br>
directions at depth di and s1,i . and s2,i . are the respective<br><br>
components along said directions of the distance between the electromagnetic field measuring means and the first borehole.<br>
Effective arrangement of the electromagnetic source means at said plurality of locations along the length of said borehole can be achieved by moving said source means through said borehole.<br>
Advantageously the electromagnetic source means includes an electromagnetic coil.<br>
The invention will now be described by way of example in more detail with reference to the accompanying drawings, wherein:<br>
Figures lA and IB schematically show the orientations of conventionally used coordinate systems when drilling and directing boreholes, and<br>
Figures 2A and 2B show exemplary measuring situations for determining vector components in two distinct planes within the conventional earth fixed coordinate system.<br><br>
In figures lA and IB conventionally used coordinate frames or systems as used are shown. In figure lA the earth fixed Cartesian reference frame NEV (North-East-Vertical) is presented wherein a part of a borehole 1 is indicated. The N-direction may be either the geographical one or the magnetic one. For every other place on earth differences between both frames are well defined. In figure IB an enlarged view of the part of borehole 1 is shown. The borehole 1 is presented as a cylinder around a central or borehole axis 2. Generally, along this axis depth values are taken, often referred to as along hole depths. For a point i a corresponding depth d. is defined, commonly taken as the distance from the earth surface to said point i along the borehole axis 2. Thus, a sequence of depth values can be presented as ,..di-2    di-1 ,   di, di+1, di+2, ... etc. In figure IB exemplary  di-1 and di. depths are shown.<br>
For example for the along borehole depth di. relevant directions within two coordinate frames are shown. The vertical V is taken from the earth fixed NEV-frame as shown with respect to figure lA. The Cartesian XYZ-frame is generally taken as fixed on a measuring apparatus placed in the borehole 1. In this frame Z is taken along the borehole axis 2 in the downhole direction and X and Y are taken correspondingly.<br>
Furthermore, at depth d. the high-side (HS)- and high-side-right (HSR)-directions are shown which are well known to those skilled in the art. HS lies in the vertical plane through Z and V, the latter being in line with the gravity acceleration vector g. HSR is perpendicular to Z and V and is consequently horizontal.<br>
It may be clear to those skilled in the art that for the general case every other coordinate frame can be used if components can be taken mathematically adequately. Thus, generally two coordinate systems are involved. A first one, C, related to the first borehole and the predetermined direction as mentioned above, and a second D, related to the second borehole. In such frames positions are indicated with parameters s. For example a second borehole has its starting point at s0 in C. For the general case B-and g-components in D are indicated with BD,i  and gD,i   when<br><br>
measured at depth d.. More general, in the context of this application, when a variable is provided with subscript i, said variable is taken at depth d. in the borehole considered.<br>
In figures 2A and 2B exemplary measuring situations for conventional coordinate frames as applied in the present invention are shown.<br>
In figure 2A the NE-plane of the NEV-coordinate frame is presented. In the frame -origin the tail of the arrow of the V-vector which is pointing downwards from the NE-plane is faced. Orthogonal projections of a first borehole 10 and a second borehole 20 upon the NE-plane are shown.<br>
The angle between the direction of the first borehole 10 and the N-direction is known as the azimuth-angle A. If for example the predetermined direction for the second borehole 20 is the parallel direction indicated as a dotted line 10a in the NE-plane, then in this figure 2A borehole 20 is deviating under a deviation angle AA from said direction. The distance between a point in the second borehole 20 and the first borehole 10 is called the lateral distance 30, 1, when taken in a horizontal plane.<br>
In figure 2B a vertical section or vertical plane in the NEV-coordinate frame through V and through a vector H in the horizontal NE-plane is presented. In the frame-origin the tip of the arrow of the E-vector which is pointing up from said plane, indicated as HV-plane, is faced. Orthogonal projections of the first borehole 10 and the second borehole 20 upon the HV-plane are shown.<br>
The angle between the direction of the first borehole 10 and the V-direction forms the inclination-angle I. If, for example, the predetermined direction of the second borehole 20 is the parallel direction, indicated as a dotted line 10b in the HV-plane, then in this figure 2B borehole 20 is deviating under a deviation angle AI from said direction slightly upwards.<br>
The distance between a point in the second borehole 20 and the first borehole 10 is called the upward distance 40, u, when taken in a vertical plane.<br><br>
As the selected direction into which the second borehole 20 has to be drilled, the direction parallel to borehole 10 is chosen. Consequently the orthogonal projections of said parallel direction within the NE-plane and the HV-plane, respectively 10a and 10b are parallel with the orthogonal projections of borehole 10. It may be clear to those skilled in the art that any selected direction can be chosen.<br>
In order to arrive at the selected direction during drilling of the second borehole 20 adjacent to the first borehole 10 suitable measurements have to be made to carry out the necessary calculations and determinations and to control the drilling operations.<br>
Since the first borehole 10 has been provided with magnetized casing portions having polestrengths adapted to be measured over the interborehole distance, magnetic field components B , B , B  of<br>
X    jr     Z<br>
the magnetic field vector B can be measured from the second borehole by means of a set of magnetometers aligned along the X, Y and Z-axis of the above said XYZ-coordinate frame which is fixed to the measuring tool arranged within the second borehole 20. Said magnetic field components generally are composed of polestrength components and earth magnetic field components.<br>
Furthermore, it is a well known technique to apply a set of accelerometers within a borehole measurement tool to measure the gravity acceleration components g , g , and g , of the gravity acceleration vector g to allow the determination of inclination data.<br>
Surprisingly, it has appeared that, having only gravity<br>
acceleration components and magnetic field components, the latter<br>
including only non-calibrated polestrength values, according to the<br>
present invention in particular azimuth angles and inclination<br>
angles can be derived, allowing an accurate control operation as to<br>
the directional drilling operation of the second borehole. The<br>
following procedure has to be followed.<br>
After having measured values of B  , B  , B  , g  , g  , and<br>
Xi.  yi.   zi.  xi.  yi.<br>
gZiat any depth di. inclination angles and azimuth angles of the<br><br>
second borehole 20 can be determined for example as indicated in US<br>
4,163,324. In the present case the determined angles for the second<br>
borehole 20 are (I + ∆I)  and (A + ∆A). at such depth di<br>
Having said angles and magnetic field components the following<br>
route is followed to arrive at ∆A.- and ∆I.-values.<br>
i       i<br>
The inclination- and highside angles as obtained above allow to arrive at highside (HS)- and highside right (HSR)-components in a straight-forward way which is visualized in figure IB. Thus, the magnetic field components to be handled are changed from B , B , and Bz to BHS, BHSR and BZ.<br>
Since the drilling operations and the magnetic field measurements are clearly coupled to first borehole characteristics, further determination and calculation procedures are focused on vector components and interborehole distances closely related thereto. Consequently this means that, besides the angles mentioned above, components and distances in the upward and lateral directions with respect to the first borehole are determined. Said directions correspond respectively with the HS- and HSR-direction of the first borehole and they are directed along dashed lines 40 and 30 in figures 2B and 2A respectively.<br>
For an arbitrary drilling direction for the second borehole 20<br>
which direction may be close to the predetermined direction such as<br>
the parallel direction presented as 10a and 10b in figures 2A and<br>
2B respectively, neither the ∆A-direction in figure 2A, nor the<br>
∆I-direction in figure 2B will probably be in spatial alignment<br>
with the corresponding first borehole projection in the HV-plane in<br>
figure 2B or the NE-plane in figure 2A respectively. Therefore a<br>
first rotation over (90° - (I + AI)) as presented in figure 2B is<br>
carried out in order to obtain components in the horizontal<br>
NE-plane thus providing a clear azimuthal reference.<br>
Since B   lies in the NE-plane per se only B and B  as<br>
HSR	Z      HS<br>
shown in figure 2B are subjected to the (90° - (I + ∆I)) rotation,<br>
resulting in the following components,<br>
BZ'  - BZ sin(I + ∆I) + BHS-cos(I + ∆I)	(1), and<br><br>
B     -  -  B Z cos(I +  ∆I) + BHSsin(I + ∆I)	(2).<br>
HS      	<br><br>
  are also shown in figure 2B.<br>
Now having been arrived in the NE-plane the new situation is<br>
sketched in figure 2A. As explained above BHSR, already positioned<br>
in the horizontal plane, and B' are shown whereas B'  has to be<br>
z	HS<br>
thought of as pointing upward from this horizontal plane. In this NE-plane a further rotation over ∆A is carried out, i.e. from the HSR-direction of the second borehole to the HSR or lateral (1) direction of the first borehole.<br>
Thus, the following components will result,<br>
(3), and   (4), both components also being shown in figure 2A.<br>
In a further step a clear inclinational reference is obtained.<br>
A rotation over (90° - I) is carried out in order to arrive at line<br>
10b in figure 2B whereas the components obtained thus far are<br>
already in spatial alignment with the azimuth direction. This<br>
rotation applied on B" and B' results in,<br>
z     HS<br>
(5), and<br>
  (6),<br>
thus obtaining the component in the upward (u) direction.<br>
In B^ and B , (4) and (6) respectively, the initial B  , B__<br>
i     u	nS   HSR<br>
and B can be substituted, giving,<br><br>
In the present case only small deviations are assumed. For the further determinations this means that ∆A is small, and consequently the approximations cos ∆A = 1 and sin ∆A - ∆A are employed. Applying these approximations and well known basic trigonometries the following results.<br><br>
As usual the components measured, i.e. B X, B Y, B Z,<br>
subsequently transferred to the BHS, BHSR  , BZ -frame, and making up<br>
B and B,, include both the earth magnetic field B_ and the<br>
u     1	°	E<br><br>
magnetic polestrength BP of the casing portions in accordance with<br>
B - B + B	(11).<br>
P   E In order to arrive at well defined polestrength components<br>
B   , B  , in the upward and lateral direction the measured<br>
P.u  P.1 components have to be corrected for the earth magnetic field B .<br>
Conventionally, the earth magnetic field is characterized by<br>
its components in the north and vertical direction, BN and BV<br>
respectively, which are known for most places on earth. Generally,<br>
by subjecting these BN and BV to well known rotations to the<br>
I-A-coordinate system the following components in the HS, HSR and<br>
Z-direction are obtained:<br>
(12),<br>
(13), and<br>
  (14).<br>
In particular the components in the upward (u, HS) and lateral<br>
(1, HSR) direction, respectively 12 and 13, can be combined easily<br>
with the above 1- and u- B-field components, respectively 9 and 10,<br>
which are also obtained for the I-A coordinate system, to arrive at<br>
the above said well-defined polestrength components.<br>
Thus, when employing B = B - B_,	(11'),<br>
p      E<br>
the following polestrength components are obtained,<br>
(15).<br>
As to the polestrengths of the casing portions of the first borehole the following is noted. In most cases the casing parts are magnetized before being arranged in the borehole to form the casing of a production well. As a result a sequence of magnetic poles, couples of which functioning as bar magnets, is obtained. Such a casing is adapted to be used as a mark for example when in case of a blowout a relief well has to be drilled. However, as set forth above, during arranging the casing parts in the borehole, rough operating conditions occur. Consequently the well defined casing magnetizations are distorted substantially. Moreover, the magnetic material is subjected to the earth magnetic field. Dependent on<br><br>
location and direction, either the material is magnetized per se, or the magnetization already applied is modified. In view of the foregoing it will be clear that in many cases real magnetization values of casing portions are not known.<br>
Besides, the casing parts which are assumed to be coupled like bar magnets along a substantially straight line, allow the approximation as a sequence of magnetic monopoles which is well known in basic physics. This means that for each depth d. the lateral and upward polestrength field value can be expressed as,<br>
(17), and<br>
  (18),<br>
P being the magnetic polestrength at position z along the<br>
k	K<br>
first borehole, and (z-z, ) being the distance between zK and z=0 with z=0 being the point of closest approach between the first borehole and the measuring tool in the second borehole.<br>
In accordance with the invention the following formula results,<br>
  (19).<br>
Thus, this relation is independent from the magnetic polestrength values PK.<br>
Referring again to figures 2A and 2B for angles ∆A and ∆I the lateral and upward distance at depth d. can be written as,<br>
(20), and (21),   being the lateral and upward distance at the previous measuring point di-1 •<br>
Rewriting (15) and (16) for depth di. in a simplified form as:<br>
(15'), and<br>
  (16'),<br>
and employing (19) to (21), then the following result is obtained,<br><br>
  (22).<br>
From the above it will be clear that all the directional data<br>
for the second borehole at d. can be arrived at now, since:<br>
1<br>
∆I is determined from inclination angles I and (I + ∆I), which angles can be found in a known manner using the accelerometers, and<br>
AA is determined as shown above.<br>
In a next step of the present invention the directional data obtained as shown above have to be compared with the data of the predetermined direction. This means that the obtained ∆A and ∆I should not exceed predetermined ranges ∆A0 and ∆I0. Preferably ∆A0 and ∆I0 are less than 10°.<br>
Dependent on said comparison, either the drilling operation can be continued in the direction followed thus far, or the drilling direction has to be corrected in lateral direction, upward direction, or both directions.<br>
Instead of the above indicated coordinate systems C and D, any suitable set of coordinate systems can be used. For example only for C the conventional NEV-frame can be taken. Furthermore, separately, for D the XYZ-frame, or even cylindrical coordinates, can be taken. In the same way direction parameters a. can be chosen, although I, A, HS, and HSR as explained above are the usual ones.<br>
In a further embodiment the method of the present invention advantageously allows the determination of strength and direction of magnetizations of casing portions. Thus, substantial distortions and/or deviations in magnetization can provide useful information on casing conditions.<br>
Moreover, if at starting the drilling operations the polestrengths are known, drilling operations can be carried out in close dependency to said strengths whereas the method of the invention advantageously allows a check procedure as to the directional data obtained.<br>
If for some reason the selected direction of the second borehole is not parallel to that of the first borehole the same<br><br>
method as explained above can be applied. Again A- and I-angles are set for making up the selected direction, and by employing (19) the method of the present invention can be applied with great advantage. In that case one has to realize that the distance between the boreholes should not become too large because of the measurability of the polestrength.<br>
In this field of technique it is well known that dependent on type of casing, polestrengths having a magnetic flux up to 18000 µWb can be obtained allowing measuring magnetic flux densities as low as 2 µT.   This means that lateral or upward distance preferably does not exceed about 30 m.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the present invention li/ui 
Furthermore the method of the present invention as explained above can be used for verifying direction and position of a second uncased borehole near a first borehole which has an accurately known position and which is provided with magnetized casing portions having polestrengths adapted to be measured from the first borehole. In this case the measuring while drilling is clearly substituted by measuring from a borehole already drilled.<br>
Besides the above advantageously the method of the present invention as explained above can be employed for determining direction and position of a first cased borehole provided with magnetized casing positions having polestrengths adapted to be measured from a second uncased borehole having an accurately known position. For example, when the second borehole is accurately drilled by means of gyro drilling control, then the reverse way of operating can be applied.<br>
Advantageously the method of the invention is employed in drilling couples of holes in shaly-sand layer formations which often necessitate injection of steam in order to arrive at desired production levels.<br><br>
Various modifications of the present invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art from the foregoing description. Such modifications are intended to fall within the scope of the appended claims.<br><br><br>

An improved method of constructing a borehole in an earth formation, in a selected direction relative to an adjacent borehole formed in the earth formation, the improvement comprising: drilling a section of the borehole; locating electromagnetic source means in a first of said boreholes at a plurality of locations along the length thereof for inducing an electromagnetic field extending into a second of said boreholes; locating electromagnetic field measuring means at a selected depth di in the second borehole for measuring said electromagnetic field; determining from the measured electromagnetic field, at least two components in directions substantially normal to the longitudinal axis of the first borehole; determining from said at least two components a direction parameter indicative of the direction of the borehole relative to the adjacent borehole; and drilling a further section of the borehole in a direction determined by the direction parameter.<br>
2.	The method as claimed in claim 1, wherein the first borehole forms the adjacent borehole, and the second borehole forms the borehole which is being created.<br>
3.	The method as claimed in claim I or 2, wherein said directions of at least two components are substantially perpendicular to each other, and the direction parameter is determined by determining a ratio of said two components.<br><br>
4<br>
4.	The method as claimed in any one of the claims 1 to 3, wherein the electromagnetic source means is located at said plurality of locations along the length of said borehole by moving said source means through said borehole.<br>
5.	The method as claimed in claim 4, wherein said electromagnetic source means has an electromagnetic coil.<br>
6.	The method as claimed in any one of the claims 1 to 3, wherein said electromagnetic source means has a casing installed in the first borehole, which casing has been magnetised at said plurality' of locations along the length of the first borehole.<br>
7.	The method as claimed in any one of the claims 1 to 6, wherein said direction parameter indicative of the direction of the borehole relative to the adjacent borehole forms a difference between the azimuth angles of said boreholes.<br>
8.	The method as claimed in any one of the claims I to 7, wherein said borehole is created so as to extend substantially parallel to the adjacent borehole.<br>
9.	The method as claimed in any one of the claims I to 8, wherein said boreholes extend substantially in a horizontal plane.<br><br>
10.	The method as claimed in any one of the claims I to 9, wherein said direction parameter indicative of the direction of the borehole relative to the adjacent borehole is used to determine a direction in which said borehole is further drilled.<br>
11.	An improved method of constructing a borehole in an earth formation, substantially as herein described with reference to the accompanying drawings.<br><br></td>
