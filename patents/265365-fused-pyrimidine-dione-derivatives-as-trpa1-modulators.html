Technical Field<br>
The present patent application relates to fused pyrimidinedinedione derivatives with transient receptor potential ankyrinl (TRPAl) activity.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
The transient receptor potential (TRP) channels or receptors are pain receptors. They have been classified into seven subfamilies: TRPC (canonical), TRPV (vanilloid), TRPM (melastatin), TRPP (polycystin), TRPML (mucolipin), TRPA (ankyrin, ANKTMl) and TRPN (NOMPC) families. The TRPC family can be divided into 4 subfamilies (i) TRPCl (ii) TRPC2 (iii) TRPC3, TRPC6, TRPC7 and (iv) TRPC4, TRPC5 based on sequence functional similarities. Currently the TRPV family has 6 members. TRPV5 and TRP V6 are more closely related to each other than to TRPVl, TRP V2, TRPV3 or TRPV4. TRPAl is most closely related to TRPV3 and is more closely related to TRPVl and TRPV2 than to TRPV5 and TRPV6. The TRPM family has 8 members. Constituents include the following: the founding member TRPMl (melastatin or LTRPCl), TRPM3 (KIAA1616 or LTRPC3), TRPM7 (TRP-PLIK, ChaK(l), LTRPC7), TRPM6 (ChaK2), TRPM2 (TRPC7 or LTRPC2), TRPM8 (TRP-p8 or CMRl), TRPM5 (MTRl or LTRPC5) and TRPM4 (FLJ20041 or LTRPC4). The TRPML family consists of the mucolipins, which include TRPMLl (mucolipin 1), TRPML2 (mucolipin 2) and TRPML3 (mucolipin 3). The TRPP family consists of two groups of channels: those predicted to have six transmembrane domains and those that have eleven. TRPP2 (PKD2), TRPP3 (PKD2L1), TRPP5 (PKD2L2) are all predicted to have six transmembrane domains. TRPPl (PKDl, PCl), PKD-REJ and PKD-ILl are all thought to have eleven transmembrane domains. The sole mammalian member of the TRPA family is ANKTMl . <br>
It is believed TRPAl is expressed in nociceptive neurons. Nociceptive neurons of the nervous system sense the peripheral damage and transmit pain signals. TRPAl is membrane bound and most likely acts as a heterodimeric voltage gated channel. It is believed to have a particular secondary structure, its N-terminus is lined with a large number of ankyrin repeats which are believed to form a spring-like edifice. TRP Al is activated by a variety of noxious stimuli, including cold temperatures (activated at 17Â°C), pungent natural compounds (e.g., mustard, cinnamon and garlic) and environmental irritants (MacPherson LJ et al, Nature, 2007, 445; 541-545). Noxious compounds activate TRPAl ion channels through covalent modification of cysteines to form covalently linked adducts. Variety of endogenous molecules produced during tissue inflammation / injury have been identified as pathological activators of TRPAl receptor. These include hydrogen peroxide which is produced due to oxidative stress generated during inflammation, alkenyl aldehyde 4-HNE - an intracellular lipid peroxidation product and cyclopentenone prostaglandin 15dPGJ2 which is produced from PGD2 during inflammation / allergic response. TRPAl is also activated in receptor dependant fashion by Bradykinin (BK) which is released during tissue injury at peripheral terminals<br>
The difference between TRPAl and other TRP receptors is that TRPAl ligand binding persists for hours due to which the physiological response (e.g., pain) is greatly prolonged. Hence to dissociate the electrophile, an effective antagonist is required.<br>
WO 2009/158719, WO 2009/002933, WO 2008/0949099, WO 2007/073505, WO 2004/055054 and WO 2005/089206 describe the TRP channels as the targets for the treatment of pain and related conditions.<br>
In efforts to discover better analgesics for the treatment of both acute and chronic pain and to develop treatments for various neuropathic and nociceptive pain states, there exists a need for a more effective and safe therapeutic treatment of diseases, conditions and/or disorders modulated by TRPA 1.<br>

The connection between therapeutic effect and inhibition of TRPAl is illustrated, for example, in Story GM et al, Cell, 2003, 1 12, 819-829; McMahon SB and Wood JN, Cell, 2006, 124, 1 123-1 125; Voorhoeve PM et al., Cell, 2006, 124, 1 169-1 181 ; Wissenbach U, Niemeyer BA and Flockerzi V, Biology of the Cell, 2004, 96, 47-54; Dayne YO, Albert YH &amp; Michael X, Expert Opinion on Therapeutic Targets, 2007, 1 1(3), 391-401 and the references cited therein.<br>
Pain can be acute or chronic. While acute pain is usually self-limiting, chronic pain persists for 3 months or longer and can lead to significant changes in a patient's personality; lifestyle, functional ability and overall quality of life (K. M. Foley, Pain, in Cecil Textbook of Medicine; J. C. Bennett &amp; F. Plum (eds.), 20th ed., 1996, 100-107). <br>
The sensation of pain can be triggered by any number of physical or chemical stimuli and the sensory neurons which mediate the response to this harmful stimulus are termed as "nociceptors". Nociceptors are primary sensory afferent (C and AÎ´ fibers) neurons that are activated by a wide variety of noxious stimuli including chemical, mechanical, thermal and proton (pH
Chronic pain can be classified as either nociceptive or neuropathic. Nociceptive pain includes tissue injury-induced pain and inflammatory pain such as that associated with arthritis. Neuropathic pain is caused by damage to the sensory nerves of the peripheral or central nervous system and is maintained by aberrant somatosensory processing. The pain is typically well localized, constant and often with an aching or throbbing quality. Visceral pain is the subtype of nociceptive pain that involves the internal organs. It tends to be episodic and poorly localized. Nociceptive pain is usually time limited, meaning when the tissue damage heals, the pain typically resolves (arthritis is a notable exception in that it is not time limited).<br>

A general approach for the synthesis of 2,4-dioxo-2,3,4,6-tetrahydro-lH-pyrrolo[3,4-]pyrimidin-5-yl)acetamide of the general formula (Ib-I) where R1, R2, Rb, U and V are as defined herein above is depicted in Scheme 5. The formyl derivative of formula (13) can be prepared by formylation of uracil derivative of formula (1) [Senda, S. et al , Yakugaku Zasshi, 1971, 91, 1372] followed by bromination of formyl derivative thus formed. Cyclization of formyl derivative of formula (13) [as described in Senda, S. et al , Synthesis, 1978, 463-465] with amine of the formula (19) in suitable solvent (e.g., EtOAc) followed by halogenation using suitable halogenating reagent (e.g., N-bromosuccinimide, iV-iodosuccinimide, Br2 in acetic acid) gives halopyrrole of general formula (14). Halopyrrole of formula (14) on reaction with allyl boronic acid pinacol ester of the formula (15) in the presence of a palladium catalyst, such as bis(triphenylphosphine)palladium dichloride or tetrakis(triphenylphosphine) palladium(O) gives allyl pyrrole of the formula (16) [procedure is similar to the Suzuki-Miyaura Coupling described by Kotha, et al., Synlett, 2005, 12, 1877-1890]. Transformation of allyl pyrrole of formula (16) into corresponding aldehyde can be accomplished by methods known in the art [e.g., Postema, M. H. D. et al., in J Org. Chem., 2003, 68, 4748-4754]. Further oxidation of aldehyde thus formed can be carried out by oxidation methods well known in the literature to give corresponding carboxylic acid of general formula (17). Coupling of carboxylic acid (17) with appropriate amines of formula (18) using a standard amide coupling method gives compounds of general formula (Ib-I).<br>

A general approach for the synthesis of 2,4-dioxo-2,3,4,7-tetrahydro-lH-pyrrolo[2,3-]pyrimidin-5-yl)acetamide of the general formula (Ic-I) where Ra is an alkyl group, R , R2, U and V are as defined above is depicted in Scheme 6. Reaction of 6-chlorouracil derivative of the formula (20) with amino ester of formula (21) followed by cyclization gives pyrrolidinone of formula (22) [Similar procedure described by Edstrom, E. D. et al., J Org Chem., 1995, 60, 5069-5076]. Pyrrolidinone of formula (22) can be converted to halopyrrole of formula (23) (wherein X is halogen) using triflic anhydride or hydrazine followed by iodine. Halopyrrole of formula (23) on reaction with allyl boronic acid pinacol ester of the formula (15) in the presence of a palladium catalyst, such as bis(triphenylphosphine)palladium dichloride or tetrakis(triphenylphosphine) palladium(O) gives allyl pyrrole of the formula (24). Transformation of allyl pyrrole of formula (24) to the corresponding aldehyde followed by further oxidation of aldehyde thus formed can be carried out by oxidation methods well known in the literature to give corresponding carboxylic acid of general formula (25). Coupling of carboxylic acid of formula (25) with appropriate amines of formula (18) by using a standard amide coupling method gives compounds of general formula (Ic-I).<br>
Scheme 6  <br>
An alternative approach for the synthesis of compounds of the general formula (Ic-I) is described in Scheme 7. Reaction of commercially available 6-aminouracil derivative of the formula (26) with chloroacetaldehyde dimethyl acetal gives pyrrole derivative (as described by Noell, C. W. et al., J Het. Chem , 1964, 34-41) which upon alkylation with appropriate alkylating agent (RaX) gives compound of formula (27). Copmound of formula (27) can be converted into Î±-keto ester of general formula (28) using oxalyl chloride followed by reaction of acid chloride thus formed with anhydrous protic solvent (e.g., methanol, ethanol, tÃ¸rt-butanol). Deoxygenation of Î±-keto ester of general formula (28) with triethylsilane in the presence of trifluoroacetic acid affords ester of general formula (29) [similar procedure described by Han, Q. et al., J Med Chem , 2000, 43, 4398-4415]. Acidic hydrolysis of ester of formula (29) gives corresponding carboxylic acid of formula (25). Coupling of carboxylic acid of formula (25) with appropriate amines of formula (18) by using a standard amide coupling method give compounds of general formula (Ic-I).<br>

(lc-1) (25) (29) An approach for the synthesis of compounds of the general formula (Id-I) where R1, R2, U and V are as defined herein above is depicted in Scheme 8. The synthesis starts from known 6-hydrazino-l,3-dimethyluracil (30) which is readily prepared by the displacement of halogen of 6-chloro-l,3-dialkyuracil of the formula (20) with hydrazine hydrate according to the known procedure. The cyclisation of compound of the formula (30) with acetic anhydride gave pyrazole of the formula (31). The deacetylation followed by selective N-alkylation of pyrazole (31) with dimethyl sulfate afforded compounds of the formula (33) (Pfleiderer, W. et al., Justus Liebigs Ann Chem. 1958, 615, 42-47). The reaction of compound of formula (33) with dimethyl carbonate in presence of a strong base (e.g. NaH) under reflux conditions gives ester of the formula (34). Hydrolysis of ester (34) with aqueous acid afforded the desired pyrazolo [3,4-d] pyrimidinedione acetic acid of the formula (35). The coupling of compound of formula (35) with respective amines of formula (18) by using a standard amide coupling method gives compounds of general formula (Id-I).<br>

An approach for the synthesis of compounds of the general formula (Ie) where R1, R2, U and V are as defined herein above is also depicted in Scheme 9. Synthesis starts from readily available 1,3-dialkylbarbituric acid of the formula (36). The known 6-chloro-5-formyl-l,3-dimethyluracil of formula (37) wherein R1 and R2 are methyl is prepared according to a reported procedure (Singh, J. S. et al., Synthesis, 1988, 342-344). The reaction of 6-chloro-5-formyl-l,3-dimethyluracil (37) with hydroxylamine in methanol followed by dehydration with phosphorous oxychloride give 6-chloro-5-cyano-1,3-dimethyluracil of formula (38). The cyclisation of compounds of the formula (38) with alkylhydrazine of the formula (39) in the presence of suitable base afforded amino pyrazole of the formula (40). The amino pyrazole (40) on diazotization followed by halide substitution with copper halide (such as copper bromide or copper iodide) gives a halide derivative of the formula (41) (wherein X is halogen). Suzuki-Miyaura coupling reaction of aryl halide of formula (41) with allyl boronic acid pinacol ester of the formula (15) as described by Kotha et al., Synlett, 2005, 12, 1877-1890) gives allyl pyrazole of the formula (42). This can be converted to pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidinylacetic acid of the formula (43) by oxidative cleavage methods well known in the literature. The coupling of carboxylic acid of the formula (43) with respective amines of formula (18) by using a standard amide coupling method can give compounds of general formula (Ie).<br>

An approach for the synthesis of compounds of the general formula (If-I) where R1, R2, U and V are as defined herein above is depicted in Scheme 10. The approach described is similar to that described by Papesch, P. et al., J Org. Chem., 1965, 30, 199-203. Compound of the formula (44) was prepared by nitration of pyrimidine-2,4(lH,3H)-dione of the formula (1) followed by reduction (Egg, Î. et al., Synthesis, 1982, 12, 1071-1073). The compound of the formula (44) was transformed into the compound of the formula (45) by diazotization followed by in situ cyclisation with base (eg. NaOH). The compound of the formula (45) on alkylation with suitable 2-halo-acetamide of general formula (4) in the presence of a suitable base (e.g. Cs2CO3, NaH etc.) and a suitable solvent (e.g. DMF, THF, DMSO etc.) gives compound of general formula (If-I). <br>

The 2-haloacetamides of formula (53) (wherein Rz is selected from alkyl, cyano, halogen, haloalkyl, alkoxy, haloalkoxy, cycloalkylalkoxy and arylalkoxy, and 'p' is selected from 0 to 5) required for the synthesis of compound of the present invention can be prepared according to methods known to one skilled in the art (Carroll, L. et al., J. Am Chem Soc, 1950, 72, 3722-3725; Ohkubo, M. et al., Chem Pharm Bull , 1995, 43(9), 1497-1504). Thus, acylation of an aryl, heteroaryl or aryl alkyl amine with bromoacetyl bromide in the presence of a suitable base such as triethylamine or pyridine gives N-substituted bromoacetamide of the general formula (53) (Scheme 11).<br>
A few of aniline derivatives, arylalkylamines and 2-amino-4-arylthiazoles (52) were commercially available. Many of the disubstituted and tri substituted arylaminothiazoles were prepared from appropriate aryl alkyl ketones. Commercially unavailable aryl alkyl ketones were prepared from the corresponding benzoic acids as shown in Scheme 1 1. Substituted benzoic acid of the formula (46) was converted to the corresponding acetophenone in three steps as shown in Scheme 1 1. Thus, acid (46) was converted to the corresponding acid chloride (47) using oxalyl chloride in the presence of catalytic amounts of DMF in dry dichloromethane. Alternatively, this transformation can be carried out using excess thionyl chloride. The acid chloride (47) was converted to corresponding Weinreb amide (48) by treating with jV,O-dimethyl hydroxylamine hydrochloride in the presence of a suitable base such as triethylamine. Addition of methyl magnesium iodide to Weinreb amide (48) gives acetophenone derivative of the formula (49). In addition, commercially unavailable aryl alkyl ketones were prepared from mono or di-substitued phenol (50) as depicted in Scheme 1 1. Thus, acetylation of phenol (50) with acetic anhydride followed by Fries rearrangement of the ester formed in the presence of Lewis acid (e.g. AlCl3) affords corresponding hydroxyacetophenone of general formula (51). Alkylation of hydroxyacetophenone of general formula (51) with suitable alkyl halide in suitable base (e.g., NaH, Cs2COj) and suitable solvent (e.g., DMSO, THF, DMF) gives acetophenone derivative of general formula (49).<br>
The aryl alkyl ketone of the formula (49) is converted to 2-aminothiazole of the formula (52) in one step by its reaction with thiourea in the presence of iodine in ethanol. This conversion is similar to the one described by Carroll, K. et al., J Am Chem Soc. 1950, 3722; and Naik, S., J.; Halkar, U. P., ARKIVOC, 2005, xiii, 141-149. Alternatively, 2-aminothiazoles of the formula (52) can be prepared by the reaction of compounds of formula (49) with bromine in acetic acid to give the alpha halo intermediate, which on reaction with thiourea in THF at reflux condition give compounds of the formula (52). The compound of the formula (52) is converted to 2-bromo-N-thiazolyl acetamide of the formula (53) by acylation with bromoacetyl bromide in the presence of a suitable base (e.g., pyridine or triethylamine) and in a suitable solvent (e.g., THF, DMF).<br>

The deacetylation of (54) in the presence of catalytic amount of concentrated sulphuric acid using suitable solvent afforded desired 5-Aryl-lH-imidazol-2-amine of the formula (55).

The precipitated salt was collected by filtration. The salt was then treated with saturated solution of NaHCO3 to re-generate the amine. The mixture was extracted with dichloromethane (2x 50 ml) and the combined organic extracts were washed with water and brine. The solvent was evaporated under reduced pressure to afford the 2-amino-4-aryl-thiazole derivative.<br>
Method 2<br>
A solution of acetophenone derivative (1.0 equiv.), thiourea (2.0 equiv.) and iodine (1.0 equiv.) in dry ethanol (5 vol) was refluxed for 24 h. The reaction mixture was diluted with ethyl acetate and the layers were separated. The organic layer was washed with sodium thiosulfate solution to remove iodine. The ethyl acetate solution was treated with IN HCl and precipitated salt collected by filtration. The free amine was re-generated as described in Method 1 given above. <br>
All the 2-amino-4-aryl-thiazole derivatives were prepared by either Method 1 or Method 2 starting from appropriate aryl alkyl ketones. Structure information and characterization data for selected intermediates are given in Table 2.<br>

ScreeninR for TRPAl antagonist using the 43Calcium uptake assay The inhibition of TRPAl receptor activation was measured as inhibition of allyl isothiocyanate (AITC) induced cellular uptake of radioactive calcium. Test compounds were dissolved in DMSO to prepare 10 mM stock solution and then diluted using plain medium with 0.1% BSA and 1.8 mM CaCl2 to get desired concentration. Final concentration of DMSO in the reaction was 0.5% (v/v). Human TRPAl expressing CHO cells were grown in F- 12 DMEM medium with 10% FBS, 1 % penicillin-streptomycin solution, 400 Î¼g / ml of G-418. Cells were seeded 24 h prior to the assay in 96 well plates so as to get ~ 50,000 cells per well on the day of experiment. Cells were treated with test compounds for 10 min followed by addition of AITC at a final concentration of 30 Î¼M and 5 Î¼Ci/ml 45Ca+2 for 3 min. Cells were washed and lysed using buffer containing 1% Triton X- 100, 0.1 % deoxycholate and 0.1% SDS. Radioactivity in the lysate was measured in Packard Top count after addition of liquid scintillant. Concentration response curves were plotted as a % of maximal response obtained in the absence of test antagonist. ICj0 value was calculated from concentration response curve by nonlinear regression analysis using GraphPad PRISM software.<br>
The compounds prepared were tested using the above assay procedure and the results obtained are given in Table 3. Percentage inhibition at concentrations of 1.0 Î¼M and 10.0 Î¼M are given in the table along with IC50 (nM) details for selected examples. The IC50 (nM) values of the compounds are set forth in Table 3 wherein "A" refers to an IC50 value of less than 50 nM, "B" refers to IC50 value in range of 50.01 to 100.0 nM and "C" refers to an IC50 values above 100.0 nM. <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
