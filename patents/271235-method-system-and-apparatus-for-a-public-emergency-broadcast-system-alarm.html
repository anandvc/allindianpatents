The present application claims the priority of the Chinese Patent Application No.<br>
200810161803.X filed on September 22, 2008, entitled "Method, System and Apparatus for a<br>
Public Emergency Broadcast System Alarm", the entire contents thereof are incorporated<br>
herein by reference.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present disclosure relates to the technical field of communications, and more<br>
particularly to a method, system and apparatus for a public emergency broadcast system<br>
alarm.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
An Earthquake and Tsunami Warning System (ETWS) is a public emergency<br>
broadcast system which sends a warning to user terminals through a Third Generation<br>
Partnership Project (3GPP) access network, which includes GSM DEGE Radio Access<br>
Network (GERAN), Universal Terrestrial Radio Access Network (UTRAN), and Evolved<br>
UTRAN (E-UTRAN), etc. When the ETWS detects an earthquake event or a tsunami event,<br>
its warning notification shall be successfully distributed to the terminals in the area<br>
influenced by earthquake or tsunami as soon as possible so as to save lives.<br>
In the prior art, a Primary Notification message of the ETWS is sent to the user<br>
terminal, so that the user terminal may receive an alarm message. The Primary Notification<br>
message is dedicated for the ETSW system and for notifying users of the most emergent<br>
event. A complete Primary Notification message of the ETWS may need to be segmented and<br>
need a plurality of Paging Request Type 1 messages to carry it. At this time, a Page Mode<br>
information element value of the Paging Request Type 1 message must be set to be "same as<br>
before", and the terminal supporting the ETWS capability will enter the non-Discontinuous<br>
Reception (non-DRX) mode when it reads out that "Page Mode" is equal to "same as before",<br>
so as to receive the paging messages for all paging groups. At this lime, all paging messages<br>
are configured to continuously broadcast the Primary Notification message, so that user<br>
terminals may receive a full warning message as soon as possible.<br>
During implementation of the present disclosure, the inventor finds that the prior art<br>
has at least the following problems.<br>
When the "page mode" information element is set to be "same as before", the<br>
terminal enters the non-DRX mode. However, the fact that the "page mode" information<br>
element is equal to "same as before" does not necessarily indicate it is the Primary<br>
Notification message that is sent, while at this time the terminal is still entering the non-DRX<br>
mode, which influences the use of the terminal. In the prior art, the fact that the terminal has<br>
entered the non-DRX mode does not indicate a complete Primary Notification message may<br>
be received. That is, a mechanism for receiving a complete Primary Notification message is<br>
not provided. Even if the terminal enters the non-DRX mode and receives one ETWS<br>
Primary Notification message completely, there is still no explicit mechanism for exiting the<br>
non-DRX mode. That is, the terminal may not exit the non-DRX mode in time. The terminal<br>
remains in the non-DRX mode for a very long time, which seriously reduces the service life<br>
of a terminal battery.<br>
BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS<br>
The technical solution according to the embodiments of the present disclosure is<br>
described clearly below with reference to the drawings in the embodiment of the present<br>
disclosure. Obviously, the described embodiments are only some exemplary embodiments of<br>
the present disclosure, not all the embodiments. All the other embodiments obtained by<br>
persons skilled in the art based on the embodiments of the present disclosure without creative<br>
effort fall within the protection scope of the present disclosure.<br>
The first embodiment of the present disclosure provides a method for a public<br>
emergency broadcast system alarm, which is described below with reference to Fig. 1. The<br>
method includes the following blocks.<br>
In block SI01, a paging request message is received.<br>
In block SI02, when the paging request message includes a partial message or an<br>
indication of a primary notification message, a terminal determines to start entering the<br>
non-DRX mode so as to continuously receive the remaining part of the primary notification<br>
message.<br>
In block SI03, the terminal exits, when the primary notification message has been<br>
received completely, the non-DRX mode. Optionally the terminal starts a timer when starting<br>
entering the non-DRX mode and exits the non-DRX mode when the timer expires.<br>
As can be seen from the above description, according to the embodiments of the<br>
present disclosure, the terminal enters the non-DRX mode only when the received paging<br>
request message includes a partial message or an indication of a primary notification message,<br>
and may exit the non-DRX mode when necessary.<br>
The second embodiment of the present disclosure provides a method for a public<br>
emergency broadcast system alarm, which is described below with reference to Fig.2. The<br>
method includes the following blocks.<br>
In block S201, a Cell Broadcast Centre (CBC) sends a Primary Notification request of<br>
the public emergency broadcast system to a Base Station Subsystem (BSS).<br>
For example, an alarm message of the public emergency broadcast system at least<br>
includes an alarm message of the ETWS system. In all the embodiments of the present<br>
disclosure, the public emergency broadcast system is the ETWS system. The apparatus for<br>
sending the Primary Notification request of the ETWS is not limited to CBC, but may include<br>
any server and/or network unit configured to send the ETWS Primary Notification request.<br>
In block S202, when the BSS receives the Primary Notification request of the ETWS,<br>
the BSS adds the ETWS Primary Notification into a Paging Request Type 1 message with or<br>
without segmentation, and continuously sends the Paging Request Type 1 message to the<br>
terminal on the Common Control Channel (CCCH) in a cell influenced by the BSS, for<br>
example the Paging Request Type 1 message is sent on the Paging Channel (PCH). The<br>
Paging Request Type 1 message includes three information elements which are "Page Mode",<br>
"Mobile Identity 1" and "PI Rest Octets". The cells influenced by BSS may be set by the<br>
CBC service center. The process of continuously sending the Paging Request Type 1 message<br>
on the CCCH is embodied as to send the Paging Request Type 1 message through the Paging<br>
Channel (PCH) on the CCCH.<br>
For example, the BSS sets the "Page Mode" information clement in the Paging<br>
Request Type 1 message, which is continuously sent on the CCCH in the influenced cell, to<br>
be "same as before". That is, the value of the Page Mode Information Element (IE)<br>
continuously set on the CCCH is "same as before". With reference to the simplified<br>
schematic diagram illustrating the setting of the Paging Request Type 1 message by the BSS<br>
as shown in Fig.3, the BSS further sets the "Mobile Identity 1" information element in the<br>
Paging Request Type 1 message to be "no identity", and sets the "PI Rest octets" information<br>
element in the Paging Request Type 1 message to include relevant information of the ETWS<br>
"Primary Notification". Through a particular instruction or command, the "PI Rest Octets"<br>
information element includes the relevant information or the indication of the ETWS<br>
"Primary Notification". That is, the Primary Notification segment is included in the "PI Rest<br>
Octets" information element.<br>
In order to avoid chaos cause by the reception of unauthorized information, the<br>
Primary Notification message may include authentication information, which may result in<br>
that data amount of the data size of the Primary Notification message may exceed the<br>
expected upper limit. As a result, the Primary Notification message needs to be segmented<br>
and then sent. For example, in terms of the expectation provided by the GERAN, the largest<br>
length of the Primary Notification message is 51 bytes, where one byte represents the type of<br>
the warning, the other 50 bytes include a digital signature. However, one paging message<br>
may carry ten or more bytes only, and the Primary Notification message needs to be<br>
segmented into four or five segments. However, each segment of the Primary Notification<br>
message is respectively included in one Paging Request Type 1 message, that is, the Primary<br>
Notification message needs to be segmented and sent in a plurality of Paging Request Type 1<br>
messages.<br>
In block S203, the terminal receives the Paging Request Type 1 message sent by the<br>
BSS, that is, the terminal receives the alarm message of the ETWS. The terminal judges<br>
whether the Paging Request Type 1 message includes the Primary Notification message.<br>
When the received message includes one part of the Primary Notification message, the<br>
terminal enters the non-DRX mode and starts a timer at the same time; meanwhile, when the<br>
received message includes one complete Primary Notification message, the terminal remains<br>
in its reception mode, that is, the terminal does not necessarily enter the non-DRX mode.<br>
Specifically, the Primary Notification message is included in the "PI Rest Octets"<br>
information element in the form of segments, so the terminal enters the non-DRX mode when<br>
the Paging Request Type 1 message received by the terminal includes a part of the Primary<br>
Notification message. That is, when the "PI Rest Octets" information element is set to<br>
include the "Primary Notification" of the ETWS, the terminal enters the non-DRX mode. In<br>
addition, the condition for the terminal to enter the non-DRX mode may also be as follows: 1)<br>
the "PI Rest Octets" information element is set to include the relevant information or the<br>
indication of the "Primary Notification" of the ETWS, and the "Page Mode" information<br>
element is set to be "same as before" at the same time; or 2) the "PI Rest Octets" information<br>
element is set to include the relevant information or the indication of the "Primary<br>
Notification" of the ETWS, the "Page Mode" information element is set to be "same as<br>
before", and the "Mobile Identity 1" information element is set to be "no identity" at the<br>
same time. In addition, the condition for the terminal to enter the non-DRX mode may also be<br>
as follows: 1) the PI Rest Octets information element is set to be the information element<br>
including the Primary Notification message of the ETWS, and the Page Mode information<br>
element is set to be "paging reorganization"; or 2) the PI Rest Octets information element is<br>
set to be the information element including the Primary Notification message of the ETWS,<br>
the Page Mode information element is set to be "paging reorganization", and the Mobile<br>
Identity 1 information element is set to be "no identity".<br>
After the terminal enters the non-DRX mode, the terminal does not deal with a<br>
network instruction if the terminal receives the network instruction which instructs the<br>
terminal to exit the non-DRX mode and/or enter the DRX mode, so as to ensure that the<br>
terminal may receive the complete Primary Notification message as soon as possible. In<br>
addition, after the terminal enters the non-DRX mode, the terminal remains in the non-DRX<br>
mode until the complete Primary Notification message has been received or until the timer<br>
exceeds the preset time limit, so as to ensure that the terminal may exit the non-DRX mode.<br>
The timer is started when the terminal enters the non-DRX mode, and the time limit of the<br>
timer may be set according to the experience or history, for example, 10s.<br>
In order to enable the terminal to receive the content of each segment of the Primary<br>
Notification message in any order, it shall be ensured that the size of each segment of the<br>
Primary Notification message and the content in each segment of the Primary Notification<br>
message are consistent. Moreover, the Paging Request Type 1 message may include the<br>
segments of Primary Notification only, rather than any other paging. When there is the<br>
Primary Notification message to be sent, the transmission priority of the warning message of<br>
the ETWS is higher than that of a normal call or paging. Meanwhile, during the warning of<br>
ETWS, other calls may still be initiated, for example, the priority call from a security<br>
department.<br>
It is obvious, in this embodiment of the present disclosure, the terminal enters the<br>
non-DRX mode only when the PI Rest Octets information element in the received Paging<br>
Request Type 1 message includes the Primary Notification message. Meanwhile, the terminal<br>
has the mechanism for exiting the non-DRX mode, and may exit the non-DRX mode when<br>
necessary, for example, when the complete Primary Notification message has been received<br>
or the timer expires.<br>
The third embodiment of the present disclosure provides a system for a public<br>
emergency broadcast system alarm, which is described below with reference to Fig.4. The<br>
system includes:<br>
a terminal 42, configured to: receive a paging request message sent by a base<br>
station subsystem BSS 41; determine, when the paging request message includes a partial<br>
message or an indication of a primary notification message, to start entering the non-DRX<br>
mode so as to continuously receive the remaining part of the primary notification message;<br>
and exit, when the primary notification message has been completely received, the non-DRX<br>
mode, or start a timer when starting entering the non-DRX mode and exit the non-DRX mode<br>
when the timer expires.<br>
Specifically, the paging request message includes the Paging Request Type 1 message.<br>
The Paging Request Type 1 message includes three information elements: PI Rest Octets,<br>
Page Mode and Mobile Identity 1. The content of PI Rest Octets includes a part of the<br>
Primary Notification message, and the BSS41 sets the PI Rest Octets information element to<br>
be the information element including the Primary Notification message.<br>
As can be seen from the above description, according to the embodiment of the<br>
present disclosure, the terminal enters the non-DRX mode only when the PI Rest Octets<br>
information element in the received Paging Request Type 1 message includes a part of the<br>
Primary Notification message. Meanwhile, the terminal has the mechanism for exiting the<br>
non-DRX mode, and may exit the non-DRX mode when necessary, for example, when the<br>
complete Primary Notification message has been received or the timer expires.<br>
The fourth embodiment of the present disclosure provides an apparatus for a public<br>
emergency broadcast system alarm, where the apparatus is a terminal, which is described<br>
below with reference to Fig.5. The apparatus includes:<br>
a receiving module 51, configured to receive a paging request message;<br>
a starting module 52, configured to determine, when the paging request message<br>
received by the receiving module 51 includes a partial message or an indication of a primary<br>
notification message, to start entering the non-DRX mode so as to continuously receive a<br>
remaining part of the primary notification message; and<br>
an exiting module 53, configured to: exit, when the primary notification message<br>
has been completely received by the receiving module 51, the non-DRX mode started by the<br>
starting module 52; or start a timer when the starting module 52 starts entering the non-DRX<br>
mode and exit the non-DRX mode started by the starting module 52 when the timer expires.<br>
The apparatus for a public emergency broadcast system alarm according to another<br>
embodiment of the present disclosure may include a remaining module 54, configured to:<br>
receive, before the exiting module 53 exits the non-DRX mode, an instruction of entering the<br>
discontinuous reception mode or exiting the non-DRX mode; and omit the instruction of<br>
entering the discontinuous reception mode or exiting the non-DRX mode, and remain in the<br>
non-DRX mode.<br>
As can be seen from the above description, in the embodiment of the present<br>
disclosure, the terminal enters the non-DRX mode only when the PI Rest Octets information<br>
element in the received Paging Request Type 1 message includes a part of the Primary<br>
Notification message. Meanwhile, the terminal has the mechanism for exiting the non-DRX<br>
mode, and may exit the non-DRX mode when necessary, for example, when the complete<br>
Primary Notification message has been received or the timer expires.<br>
With the description of the above embodiments, persons skilled in the art may clearly<br>
appreciate that the present disclosure may be realized by means of a hardware or by means of<br>
a software plus a necessary common hardware platform. Based on the understanding, the<br>
technical solutions of the embodiments of the present disclosure may be embodied in the<br>
