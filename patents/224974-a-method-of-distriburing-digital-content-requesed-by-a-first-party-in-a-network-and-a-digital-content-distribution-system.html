				<td>A Method Of Distributing Digital Content Requested by A<br>
First Party In A Network And A Digital Content Distribution System<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002] The invention relates to the distribution of content (which as used herein broadly<br>
encompasses information of all sorts including, but not limited to, messages, text, audio, video,<br>
multi-media materials, and the like). More particularly, the invention relates to the distribution of<br>
such content in a manner that ensures that the copyrights and other simitar legal rights of the<br>
content owner are respected.<br>
[0003] More and more content is being delivered in digital form, and more and more digital<br>
content is being delivered over private and public networks, such as Intranets, the Internet, cable<br>
TV networks, and the like. For consumers of such content, digital versions (as opposed to analog,<br>
paper copy, and other forms) provide various advantages such as enhanced fidelity, improved and<br>
greater playback options, interactivity, and others. Online or network delivery generally offers<br>
greater convenience and timeliness. Online delivery is also cheaper than other delivery methods,<br>
and this benefits content publishers.<br>
[0004] Most current and potential digitally distributed content is, like most books,<br>
distributed in a manner such that the publisher or owner generally gives or sells the content to a<br>
consumer, but continues to restrict rights to use the content even after the content is under the<br>
sole physical control of the consumer. For instance, a content owner typically retains copyright to<br>
the content so that the consumer cannot legally reproduce or publish the work without permission.<br>
Digital content, as opposed to older forms of media, allows a content owner to adjust pricing<br>
according to whether the consumer is allowed to make a persistent copy, or is just allowed to view<br>
the content as it is delivered.<br>
Prior art reference Hunter et a!., U.S. Patent No. 6,647,417, discloses a<br>
music distribution system where music is blanket transmitted to each customer's<br>
computer-based user station. A customer makes a selection for music, the music<br>
is transferred as an encrypted, compressed file, and the customer uses decoding<br>
keys to decode the files. Additionally, an antipiracy "ID tag" is woven into the<br>
recorded music so that any illegal copies therefrom may be traced to the<br>
purchase transaction.<br>
U.S. PreGrant Publication 2004/0024670 discloses a rights management<br>
system using a legality expression language. The legality expression language<br>
includes elements for specifying at least one of an obligation, a prohibition, an<br>
intention, or an assertion. The legality expressions are stored on removable<br>
storage media, smart cards, card readers, card writers, and the like, and can be<br>
authenticated by an interpreter and/or validator. After authentication, a user of a<br>
legality expression may gain access, get a particular right, or the like.<br>
[0005] Despite the worthwhile attributes of digital and network distribution, content owners<br>
are still generally reluctant to distribute content, particularly high-value content, via networks<br>
because unauthorized duplication, piracy, and distribution of digital content (e.g., as was done by<br>
users of Napster) is very easy. Unlike analog recorders, photocopiers, and other older devices,<br>
current technology permits unlimited, pristine copies of digital content to be made. And, in most<br>
instances, copies of the digital content can be made very quickly or nearly instantaneously.<br>
Furthermore, even current protective measures such as public key encryption and the content<br>
scrambling system ("CSS"), which is used for digital versatile discs, have been defeated.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0006] In light of the above, there is a need to provide a method and system of distributing<br>
content that ensures that the rights of content owners are respected.<br>
[0007] The present invention provides among other things a multiple party system for<br>
distributing content. In one embodiment, four parties are involved in the system: a consumer, a<br>
service provider, an authenticator, and a content provider. The distribution of content from the<br>
content provider to the consumer is carried out using a predefined protocol, mutating IDs, and<br>
licenses. The authenticator controls the distribution of mutating IDs and verifies the identity of one<br>
or more parties.<br>
[0008] The invention also provides a method for distributing content. In one embodiment,<br>
the method includes having a consumer make a request for content to a service provider and<br>
relaying the request to a content provider. In response to the request, the content provider creates<br>
a license that includes identifying information concerning the service provider and encrypted<br>
information identifying the requested content. The license is sent to the service provider. The<br>
service provider encrypts the license from the content provider with one of its own licenses and<br>
sends this message to the consumer. The consumer encrypts the message to create an<br>
authentication request and sends the authentication request to an authenticator. The authenticator<br>
checks the authentication request and, if valid, informs the content provider to send encrypted<br>
content to the consumer. A decryption key is sent by the authenticator to the consumer so that the<br>
consumer may decrypt and view the content.<br>
[0009] In another embodiment, the invention provides content distribution system that<br>
includes an authenticator and a content provider. The content provider has content and a content<br>
identifier, and generates a first mutating identifier associated with the content identifier. The<br>
system also includes a consumer device that is operable to generate a request for the content. In<br>
addition, the system includes a service provider. The service provider receives the request from<br>
the consumer device, receives the first mutating identifier from the content provider, generates a<br>
second mutating identifier associated with the first mutating identifier, and distributes the second<br>
mutating identifier to the consumer device. The consumer device generates a third mutating<br>
identifier associated with the second mutating identifier, and distributes the third mutating identifier<br>
to the authenticator. The authenticator validates the request and thereafter informs the service<br>
provider of the validity of the request. If the request is valid, the content provider thereafter<br>
encrypts the content and sends the encrypted content to the consumer while the authenticator<br>
sends a decryption code to the consumer.<br>
[0010] As is apparent from the above, it is an advantage of the present invention to<br>
provide a method and system of distributing content. Other features and advantages of the<br>
present invention will become apparent by consideration of the detailed description and<br>
accompanying drawings.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0028] Before embodiments of the invention are explained in detail, it is to be understood<br>
that the invention is not limited in its application to the details of the construction and the<br>
arrangements of the components set forth in the following description or illustrated in the drawings.<br>
The invention is capable of still other embodiments and of being practiced or being carried out in<br>
various ways. Also, it is to be understood that the phraseology and terminology used herein is for<br>
the purpose of description and should not be regarded as limiting.<br>
[0029] In particular it should be understood that the invention is implemented using<br>
various computer devices, such as personal or home computers, servers, and other devices that<br>
have processors or that are capable of executing programs or sets of instructions, including special<br>
purpose devices such as set top boxes. In general, the invention may be implemented using<br>
existing hardware or hardware that could be readily created by those of ordinary skill in the art.<br>
Thus, the architecture of exemplary devices wili not be explained in detail, except to note that the<br>
devices will generally have a processor, memory (of some kind), and input and output devices. In<br>
some cases, the devices may also have operating systems, and application programs that are<br>
managed by the operating systems. The hardware devices will also generally need some ability,<br>
depending on the role of the device in the particular embodiment of the invention implemented, to<br>
compress or decompress data and to encode data or decode encrypted data. In many instances,<br>
a decompression capability may be provided using available codecs, such as a hardware-<br>
implemented MPEG codecs. A decryption capability may be provided using a decryption hardware<br>
or software module capable of decrypting data that is encrypted using the encryption algorithm<br>
chosen. One encryption algorithm that is suitable for use in embodiments of the invention is the<br>
Rijndael algorithm, an example of which is available at<br>
http://www.esat.kuleuven.ac.be/~rilmen/riindael/rii ndaelref.zip.<br>
[0030] Fig. 1 illustrates an exemplary system 20 configured to distribute content over a<br>
network. In reality, one or more networks or communicationsystems such as the internet, the<br>
telephone system, wireless networks, satellite networks, cable TV networks, and various other<br>
private and public networks could be used in various combinations to provide the communication<br>
links desired or needed to create embodiments or implementations of the invention, as would be<br>
apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art. Thus, the invention is not limited to any specific network<br>
or combinations of networks. However, it is preferred that the networks or communication system<br>
used have .the ability to support secure communications such as communications with data<br>
encrypted with a version of Rijndael encryption, secured socket layer ("SSL") communications, or<br>
others. Furthermore, data can be transferred from one party to another with wire, DSS, or physical<br>
media being physically carried from one party to another.<br>
[0031] In the embodiment shown, the system 20 includes four participants: a content<br>
owner or provider 22, a service provider 24, such as a cable company, Internet service provider, or<br>
the like, a consumer 26, and an authenticator 28. Although, only one content provider, service<br>
provider, and customer are shown, in most implementations of the invention numerous content<br>
providers, service providers, and customers will be involved. Further, there could even be multiple<br>
authenticators, although only one is required. In practice, it is likely that the following relationship<br>
will exist: no. of authenticators 
customers, but again there is no limit on the number of participants or any requirement of a<br>
particular relationship between the numbers of the various types of participants.<br>
[0032] The participants 22,24,26, and 28 are connected to each other via two-way links<br>
30, 32, 34, 36, and 38. These links may be a constructed from all or part of the networks<br>
mentioned above. The system 20 uses a key-based encryption algorithm and currently available<br>
algorithms such as the Rijndael algorithm may be used. The ultimate choice for the algorithms<br>
used will depend on a variety of factors including a trade off between the strength of the algorithm<br>
(in terms of being broken) and speed (in terms of a processor's capability to perform the<br>
mathematical operations required by the chosen algorithm).<br>
[0033] In one embodiment of the invention, it is assumed that the customer has a<br>
decoding processor or similar device, which may, for example, take the form of a "set top box,"<br>
home computer, or other device. In this same embodiment, it is assumed that the decoding<br>
processor is in a "hostile environment," in the sense that customer may possibly want to tamper or<br>
otherwise circumvent rights management features of the decoding processor. Thus, it is preferred<br>
that the decoding processor be housed in a container that has the ability to detect intrusions to its<br>
interior. It is also preferable, that the decoding processor have "persistent" memory such as non-<br>
volatile RAM, EPROM, or other storage where data remains intact after the removal of power. The<br>
persistent memory is used to store identification information, which may be a "mutating ID" that<br>
changes over time.<br>
[0034] In preferred embodiments, the system 20 uses a random number generator to<br>
generate certain numbers used by a protocol implemented or followed by the system. It is<br>
preferred that the random number generator produce numbers that are as truly random as is<br>
possible with the particular technology used to implement the invention. In one embodiment,<br>
communication traffic, such as requests from customers to obtain content, is used to create<br>
random numbers. Such requests occur, in general, in an unpredictable manner. Thus, the<br>
random numbers generated based on such traffic are also truly or nearly truly random, as opposed<br>
to pseudo random numbers generated with algorithmic methods.<br>
[0035] In the exemplary embodiment shown, each of the parties 22-28 in the system 20<br>
has different responsibilities and it is assumed that each party trusts the authenticator 28. Further,<br>
it is preferable that content provider 22, service provider 24, and consumer 26 be assigned a<br>
changing or mutating identifier ("ID"), which is explained further below.<br>
Content Provider<br>
[0036] The content provider 22 is an entity such as a movie studio, recording company, or<br>
any other entity that wishes to distribute content electronically. In general, it is assumed that the<br>
content provider 22 owns the copyright or other intellectual property rights in the content or is<br>
authorized by the owner of such rights to distribute the content. It is assumed that the content<br>
provider 22 wants to be reimbursed fairly for each copy of its content distributed using the system<br>
20. Thus, in one preferred embodiment of the invention, the system 20 is configured such that the<br>
content provider 22 can produce a virtual inventory of its content (i.e., a list of mutating IDs<br>
(generally created as needed)), where each mutating ID represents a license to view or in some<br>
cases maintain a copy of the content provided. The virtual inventory (or set of licenses) may be<br>
assigned to various distribution entities, such as one or more service providers. As the virtual<br>
inventory is consumed, the consumption is tracked in order to record, log, or note which service<br>
provider 24 provided the content to one of the consumers. For instance, tracking of the virtual<br>
memory allows a content provider such as a movie studio, which has sold distribution rights to a<br>
cable company and a satellite broadcasting company, to determine which of the entities, the cable<br>
company or the satellite broadcasting company, distributed the content to the subject consumer.<br>
The tracking system also allows the consumption activity of individual consumers to be recorded or<br>
logged. In preferred embodiments, the content provider 22 is the sole encrypter of its content and<br>
controls the decoding of the content by, for example, denying a request, as explained further<br>
below.<br>
Service Provider<br>
[0037] In the embodiment shown, the service provider 24 distributes content of the<br>
content providers. However, service providers may also have several addition responsibilities,<br>
including identification of themselves and the subject content with mutating IDs. In the<br>
embodiments described, content cannot be decoded by a user such as the consumer 26 without<br>
the appropriate mutating IDs. In many scenarios, the service provider 24 provides the requested<br>
content off of or from a storage device that is local to the service provider 24. However, the<br>
invention is not limited to any particular location of the content and content may be retrieved from<br>
storage of the content provider 22 and then transferred to the consumer 26. In preferred<br>
embodiments of the invention, every service provider 24 sees each request from consumers in the<br>
system 20 and receives authentication from the authenticator 28. In some embodiments, any one<br>
of the service providers in a particular embodiment may be responsible for shipping or transferring<br>
the content to the consumer. This allows content providers to avoid having to deliver their content<br>
to service providers, if they so desire. In other words, the service provider 24 need not possess<br>
(such as by maintaining encrypted copies in local storage) the content that is ordered by<br>
consumers.<br>
Consumer<br>
[0038] It is assumed that at least some consumers may wish or attempt to view content<br>
without paying for it. Therefore, measures are provided to prevent unauthorized viewing of<br>
content. The mutating IDs mentioned above provide one mechanism by which content decoding<br>
and, therefore, viewing is controlled. By encapsulating multiple mutating IDs, the set top box is<br>
able to prove to the authenticator 28 that 1) the set top box is a licensed decoder of the content, 2)<br>
the service provider 24 is a licensed distributor of the content, and 3) the content itself was<br>
licensed for use by the content provider 22 for the consumer, as will be explained in greater detail.<br>
Authenticator<br>
[0039] The authenticator 28 is the repository that holds the data necessary to decode a<br>
particular piece of content. In the embodiments discussed, the authenticator 28 verifies the<br>
consumer 26, the service provider 24, and the content by their mutating IDs before sending any<br>
decoding information to the subject consumer 26. The authenticator 28 is also the source of<br>
mutating IDs and keeps track of such IDs using a database or similar mechanism.<br>
Mutating ID<br>
[0040] An exemplary mutating ID 38 (sometimes referred to as a "license") is shown in<br>
Fig. 3a. The mutating ID 38 is an identifier having two portions: a first portion 40 and a second<br>
portion 42. The first portion 40 is an identifying number, which is a random number. The second<br>
, portion 42 is an encoding/decoding key, also a random number and preferably a symmetric cipher<br>
key. As implemented in the embodiments discussed herein, a mutating ID can be used only once<br>
and then can not be used again. Mutating IDs are generated and tracked by the authenticator 28.<br>
Because the mutating IDs are one-time-use mechanisms, once a service provider or consumer or<br>
other entity has used its supply of mutating IDs, additional mutating IDs must be obtained from the<br>
authenticator 28. The data in a mutating ID is chosen at random with an equal probability of all<br>
possible mutating IDs. While it is preferred that the mutating ID parts be random, the parts are<br>
generated such that they cannot be derived from each other by any means. When a collision<br>
occurs in the ID parts, a new one is reassigned. As a result, part of the ID is completely random<br>
while the other part is less random. Once a request or decode for specific content has been made,<br>
the three mutating IDs (consumer, service provider, content) are discarded and new mutating IDs<br>
generated for additional transactions, in a manner described in more detail below. Information<br>
regarding how mutating IDs are distributed to parties in the system 20 is also provided in Figs.3b and 3c.<br>
Protocol<br>
[0041] The system 20 uses a protocol to govern communications between entities. Each<br>
entity is randomly assigned a one-time-use identifier (such as the identifier shown in FIG. 3A) that<br>
is to be tagged onto a previously mutated identifier by the authenticator 28. Each identifier<br>
includes a random license number 40 and a random corresponding coding key 42. The one-time-<br>
use identifier takes the form of a modified hash. In addition to being random, the one-time-use<br>
identifier or the hash is immediately discarded after each decryption. In other words, the protocol<br>
generates a new random number that has never been used when a hash or a one-time-use<br>
identifier is needed. In addition to identifying the content to be distributed, the one-time-use<br>
identifier is also completely unrelated hash from the content being encrypted. That is, the hash<br>
does not contain any information of the content including the identity of the entity. In this way, the<br>
identities of the entities are blind to all participants except for the authenticator 28.<br>
[0042] After the authenticator 28 randomly assigns an identifier to the content, the content<br>
provider will then catalog the virtual inventory for distribution. The random identifier provides a<br>
non-deterministic or a random component to the encryption of the identifier. Since there is non-<br>
deterministic information in the identifier, there can be no decoding information gained by knowing<br>
the decoding key. By identifying everything encoded with one of the decoding keys generated by<br>
the authenticator 28, the authenticator 28 can identify who asked for them, when they asked for<br>
them, and for what purpose they asked for them.<br>
[0043] There are four pieces of information to be distributed by the authenticator 28. The<br>
first is the requested content or the content to be distributed. The second and third are a decode<br>
license to be used by the consumer 26 once the license is authenticated, and a distribution license<br>
for distributing the encrypted content to the consumer 26. The last is a consumer identifier. To<br>
decrypt the content, the decryption takes place in reverse order to the path of distribution. By<br>
encapsulating or stacking one inside another or tagging one to another, the encrypted data is<br>
secured. Even if it were possible to obtain the encrypted data, it is considered infeasible to break<br>
since the encryption used is at least as strong as Rijndael.<br>
[0044] As a result, the preferred embodiments of the system 20 are implemented with an<br>
encryption algorithm and a random number generator. Preferably, the encryption algorithm is a<br>
symmetric key-based encryption algorithm. The keys are permutation identifications, offsets, and<br>
skips. All three could be bundled into one object called a "key." Therefore, any key based<br>
encryption algorithm can be used in embodiments of the invention. Since introducing a new<br>
encryption algorithm can be a very time consuming process, the system 20 was created to allow<br>
already existing and tested key-based encryption algorithms to be used.<br>
[0045] With respect to generating a random number, in the embodiment shown, three<br>
different procedures are used. Of course, other combinations of random number procedures can<br>
also be used to generate a random number. The first random number generation procedure is a<br>
standard congruential random number. The first random number generation generates a random<br>
number that is used to determine a sampling rate of a random stream.<br>
[0046] Acquiring a random stream is a difficult part of the entire random number<br>
generation process. By conventional definition, a random stream or a set of numbers is<br>
considered random if and only if the set is the most compact way to represent the numbers. For<br>
instance, given the set 2, 4, 6, 8,10, ©, a more compact representation would be {2i\i e Z+} or any<br>
even number in the positive integer number set. Another way to state this is a set of numbers for<br>
which there is no discernable "pattern." The goal of encrypted communication is to remove all<br>
patterns from the encrypted data being transmitted so that intelligent guessing cannot be used to<br>
decrypt the encrypted transmitted data. In embodiments of the system 20, the authenticator 28<br>
provides all the random numbers used in the distribution and transmission of content. As<br>
discussed in more detail, the sequence of generated numbers is a sequence of random numbers<br>
or a random stream, or at least a close approximation to a random stream.<br>
[0047] The third process of the random number generator is to ensure that there is no<br>
deterministic way to retrieve the next number. The random streams coming into and leaving the<br>
authenticator 28 are encrypted and thereby contain encrypted data. This non-deterministic<br>
mechanism used to generate the random stream helps ensure that the random number sequence<br>
cannot be represented by a more compact expression, hence defining a random stream.<br><br>
[0048] For example, the authenticator 28 is designed to receive requests to decode<br>
various content. These requests will reach the authenticator 28 in a random order. For instance,<br>
suppose customer X requests the keys to movie Y, and customer W requests the keys to song Z,<br>
etc. These requests are formalized by the protocol as sequences of numbers that have been<br>
arbitrarily chosen either to be intentionally arbitrary or encrypted by an arbitrary key. Since the<br>
requests are arbitrary in nature and are processed in an arbitrary fashion, a stream of random<br>
numbers is naturally generated. By sampling this stream in a semi-arbitrary way (i.e., congruential<br>
random number), a very good sequence of random numbers is generated.<br>
[0049] In one embodiment, the protocol used in the system 20 combines a packet<br>
assembly disassembly generator or PAD, key pairing, and a RC4 random stream cipher. More<br>
specifically, to encrypt the information in a window of data, a PAD series is generated once a PAD<br>
generator is chosen. A second random stream P is generated based on the PAD series in the<br>
following manner:<br><br>
where pk is the k-\h element of the P series, and pad(k) modnn is the j-th element of the PAD series.<br>
That is, every element of the P series is a combination of exclusive-ORing of the elements in the<br>
series generated by the PAD generator. The key pair generally includes a public key and private<br>
key. These key do not have any mathematical relation. They are generated randomly and<br>
independently of each other. The keys themselves are simply twenty or more digit numbers. Each<br>
entity has a unique key pair.<br>
[0050] An exemplary embodiment of the protocol will now be discussed in greater detail.<br>
In the embodiment shown, the content provider 22 performs encryption (and is sometimes referred<br>
to as the "encrypter"). The content provider 22 encrypts content with a particular key or set of keys<br>
K. The content provider 22 may store or keep the set of keys K or, alternatively, the authenticator<br>
28 may maintain the set of keys. If so maintained, the authenticator 28 maintains the set of keys K<br>
in secret. The content of the content provider is assigned a secret identifying label (e.g., a number<br>
that, in general, never changes). The label is given to the authenticator 28 and the authenticator<br>
associates the label with the keys needed to decode the encrypted content. The association is<br>
indirect, as the association process does not provide any entity access to the actual keys. The<br>
encrypted content can now be given to the service provider 24 or another entity without fear of<br>
unauthorized decoding, because only the content provider and the authenticator have the actual<br>
keys needed to decrypt the content. At this point, the content provider 22 creates the virtual<br>
inventory for the content. This involves asking the authenticator 28 for as many mutating IDs as<br>
the content provider 22 needs or wants to have. Each mutating ID represents a license allowing<br>
exactly one use or consumption of the content. As mentioned earlier, the mutating ID is a number<br>
and a key. The content provider 22 encrypts the identifying label with the mutating ID key and<br>
groups the mutating ID number and encrypted identifying label into a single piece of data called the<br>
"encrypted identifier," which is represented here as "Econtent."<br>
[0051] As each piece of content is consumed, the authenticator 28 tracks which service<br>
provider 24 the particular content came from and notifies the content provider 22 of each such<br>
decoding. Once it receives content, the service provider 24 combines each encrypted piece of<br>
content with other identifying data before distribution to the consumer 26. Each service provider<br>
24 keeps a collection of mutating IDs on hand that are used to identify that particular service<br>
provider. As with all others, these mutating IDs are created and tracked by the authenticator 28.<br>
The service provider 24 will also have a list of Econtent identifiers for each piece of content. Once<br>
requested, the service provider 24 picks an unused Econten, identifier and one of its unused mutating<br>
IDs. The service provider encrypts the Econtent identifier with the key of the chosen mutating ID and<br>
attaches the associated number creating a piece of data referred to herein as the "distributable<br>
content" or "Edistrib" The service provider 24 sends the Edisturb content to the consumer 26 and<br>
awaits a confirmation signal from the authenticator 28 that will allow decoding.<br>
[0052] The confirmation signal is received as an encrypted parcel of data that can be<br>
decrypted with the mutating ID key used to create the Edistrib content. The confirmation signal is an<br>
agreed on, secret set of bytes set by the service provider 24 and authenticator 28. Once the<br>
confirmation has been received and verified, the service provider 24 can send the encrypted<br>
content or Econtent identifier to the consumer 26.<br>
[0053] As noted above, it is assumed that the consumer 26 wants to cheat the system 20.<br>
For that reason, all communications between the consumer 26 and the authenticator 28 are<br>
encrypted by some encrypted communication method. The consumer 26 is given only one<br>
mutating ID at a time. When the consumer 26 wants to view or receive some content, the<br>
consumer 26 makes a selection of the desired content using the set top box or hardware in place<br>
at the site of the consumer 26. The hardware device then requests the content from the service<br>
provider 24 who will send the EdiStrib content for a particular decode. Once this has been received<br>
by the consumer 26, the Edistrib content is encrypted with the consumer's mutating ID key and<br>
coupled with the mutating ID number into a consumer identifier referred to as an EcOnsumer identifier.<br>
The Econsumer identifier is then sent to the authenticator 28 for verification. Upon verification, the<br>
authenticator 28 informs the service provider 24 by a secure channel that the consumer's set top<br>
box is licensed to view the subject content. The authenticator 28 also discards the current set top<br>
box mutating ID and sends the set top box a new, unused mutating ID.<br>
[0054] The consumer 26 simultaneously receives, from separate sources, the encrypted<br>
data and keys necessary to decrypt the data. With this, the decoding device can decode the<br>
requested content.<br>
[0055] Generation of mutating IDs and keeping track of them is the primary task of the<br>
authenticator 28. Distribution of mutating IDs to content providers and service providers can be<br>
handled via any acceptable means to both, as long as they stay secret to the respective receiver.<br>
To ensure that consumers do not ever have more than one mutating ID, once an Econsumer identifier<br>
is verified as accurate, a new mutating ID is encrypted using the consumer's current mutating ID<br>
key and sent to the consumer 26. The consumer can then use that ID for the next transaction.<br>
Since the authenticator 28 keeps track of all mutating IDs, it can verify that an Econsunier identifier is<br>
or contains a valid request. To do so, it will find the key associated with the number in the Econsumer<br>
identifier and decrypt it, revealing the Econsumer identifier. If no key can be found, then the<br>
authenticator 28 returns a failure. Using the exact same process, the authenticator 28 recovers<br>
the ECOntent identifier. If no key can be found, then the authenticator 28 returns a failure. Once<br>
again, the authenticator 28 decrypts the Econtenl identifier, if possible. If it is possible, the<br>
authenticator 28 look ups the confirmation code for the service provider 24, encrypts it with the<br>
mutating ID key used by the service provider 24, and returns it to the service provider. A new<br>
mutating ID is then sent, followed by the decoding data. The authenticator 28 then notes or<br>
otherwise records all the participating parties, time, and content involved in the transaction for<br>
billing purposes.<br>
[0056] As was noted above, one aspect of the invention is to ensure that copies of content<br>
are not obtained by unauthorized or unlicensed entities. In the embodiments discussed, obtaining<br>
an unauthorized copy of the content would require a person or entity to intercept a message and<br>
then break the encrypted content. It is assumed that this is impossible, at least in practical terms,<br>
because even if the content was intercepted (which would not be a trivial task) decoding it would<br>
be very difficult. This is so, in part, because it is possible, using the random numbers and<br>
encryption algorithm discussed to create encrypted data that would require a very long time (on the<br>
order of years and in the inventor's opinion, may thousands of years) to decrypt, Types of attack<br>
would generally require correctly guessing or otherwise obtaining an Econsumer identifier. However,<br>
since each mutating ID is used only once by the controller of that ID, there is no way to divine one<br>
Econsumer identifier by inspecting another. Further, since the mutating IDs are calculated to be<br>
random (to the limit of the random number generator), it is infeasible to calculate one mutating ID<br>
from another.<br>
[0057] In addition to providing a high degree of security, the protocol allows for<br>
interchangeable parties at each position. In other words, multiple content providers can use<br>
multiple service providers to reach multiple consumers using the authenticator 28 agreed upon by<br>
all parties. Further, positions can easily be merged or modified to fit many different distribution<br>
models. However, it is generally required that the virtual inventory be maintained by the content<br>
provider 22 and/or service provider. As noted, the virtual inventory is preferably a list including<br>
secret mutating IDs. The virtual inventory may be traded like any other commodity. Thus, rather<br>
than a discrete piece of data being the actual digital content of the desired piece of content, it<br><br>
becomes the ECOnsumer identifier constructed by a particular set of events leading to one particular<br>
viewing of that content. Since the EconSumer identifier cannot be constructed without cooperation<br>
from all parties involved, all parties have the ability to negotiate and reach a mutually beneficial<br>
arrangement for the consumption of digital content at the demand of the consumer 26. Should one<br>
party decide to not participate, communication with the authenticator 28 can prevent decoding by<br>
withdrawing the consent of one or more parties.<br>
[0058] As was noted above, the system 20 is not limited to just four parties. More<br>
distribution layers can be introduced and verified through the unraveling process in the same<br>
manner. For instance, one service provider 24 can distribute to another service provider. The<br>
authenticator 28 can continue to unravel an Econsumer identifier until it has found a content provider<br>
22. This can be accomplished by the simple recursive algorithm used to create Econsumer identifiers.<br>
The important distinction is that the implementation of the authenticator 28 controls the ultimate<br>
decoding of content based upon the Econsumer identifier. Should a content provider 22 or service<br>
provider 24 want to control the distribution downstream, it is easy to control by informing the<br>
authenticator 28 to deny decoding of content under particular circumstances.<br>
[0059] Additional aspects of embodiments of the invention will now be described with<br>
respect Figs. 4-13.<br>
[0060] Fig. 5 illustrates the overall process of the consumer 26 requesting content in one<br>
embodiment of the invention. First, the consumer 26 makes a request for a particular piece of<br>
content (step 50). The request may include an identifier or label associated with the particular<br>
piece of content that the consumer found using a search engine or catalog of available content.<br>
The label may also be a title of the content such as a movie title or song title. The service provider<br>
24 then requests an encrypted license 52 from the content provider 22 that is associated with the<br>
desired content. The service provider sends the license 52 to the customer 26 (step 54). The<br>
customer's hardware (e.g., a set top box), encrypts the license 52 with a mutating ID (previously<br>
received from the authenticator 28) and sends the now doubly encrypted license 52 to the<br>
authenticator 28 (step 56). The authenticator 28 checks the license 52 for validity. If the license is<br>
valid, the authenticator 28 so informs the service provider (step 58). The service provider then<br>
sends the content to the consumer 26 (step 60). At the same or nearly the same time, the<br>
authenticator 28 sends decoding information to the consumer 26 (step 62).<br>
[0061] As should be apparent from the discussion above, the license 52 undergoes<br>
multiple transformations, in the sense that the license is encrypted multiple times. Fig. 4 illustrates<br>
this process. The content provider creates the license 52 upon receiving a request for particular<br>
content. The license is an encrypted version of the randomly determined, secret identifier that the<br>
content provider created for the subject content. The now once encrypted version of the license<br>
(license 63 in Fig. 4) is sent to the service provider 24. The service provider 24 encrypts the<br><br>
license again (license 64 in Fig. 4) and the now doubly encrypted version is sent to the consumer<br>
26. The doubly encrypted license is encrypted with the mutating ID of the consumer to create a<br>
thrice-encrypted version (license 65 in Fig. 4). Authentication or verification of the license and<br>
ultimately delivery and decoding of information is then performed as noted in the discussion above<br>
with respect to Fig. 5. Fig. 6 provides another illustration of the process, including the multiple<br>
encryption steps.<br>
[0062] Fig. 7 illustrates that embodiments of the invention may include multiple service<br>
providers. Furthermore, it is envisioned that service providers may have their own content or<br>
licenses to particular content that other service providers may desire. Thus, various requests for<br>
and transfers of licenses (as shown) may occur between service providers in order to make a large<br>
variety of content available to the ultimate consumers of the various service providers participating<br>
in the system 20.<br>
[0063] Fig. 8 illustrates how mutating IDs are implemented in one embodiment of the<br>
invention. As shown, the consumer 26 is assigned a first mutating ID 100. The consumer uses<br>
that mutating ID to confirm its identity (as shown in box 102, which corresponds to step 56 in Fig.<br>
5). However, once the license 100 is used, the authenticator modifies the license 100 or, in other<br>
words, sends a new key pair to the consumer, as shown in box 104. The new key pair, in effect,<br>
creates a new mutating ID 106.<br>
[0064] Figs. 9a and 9b illustrate one way on managing content keys. If desired, the<br>
system 20 may be set up or configured such that the content provider 22 provides a list of content<br>
keys to the authenticator 28. If the system 20 is implemented in this fashion, a request made by<br>
the consumer 26 for content is transferred (through one or more intermediary service providers<br>
and/or other content providers) to the content provider 22 (step 110). The content provider then<br>
sends a license to the consumer 26 (again, through one or more intermediary service providers)<br>
(step 112). The consumer 26 then sends its content license to the authenticator for verification or<br>
authentication (step 114). If verified, verification information is sent to the content provider 22 (step<br>
116). The authenticator 28 then sends the content key to the consumer 26, so that the content can<br>
be decoded and viewed (step 118).<br>
[0065] Figs. 10a and 10b illustrate another way of managing keys. The overall process is<br>
similar to what was described above with respect to Figs. 9a and 9b, except that no keys are sent<br>
to the authenticator 28, but maintained with the content provider 22.<br>
[0066] Figs. 11-13 illustrate ways in which service and content providers can share<br>
content, if desired. One way of sharing content is for each content provider to hold the rights to<br>
certain content to create a license upon receiving a request for the desired content (Fig. 11).<br>
Alternatively, content providers may distribute a predetermined number of licenses to downstream<br>
providers so that they do not have to respond to each request on an individual basis and so that<br><br>
provider would be able to send appropriate keys needed for decoding based on the mutating ID<br>
stored in the hardware.<br>
Real Time Authentication of User and Real Time Play Back of Content.<br>
[0072] As noted, one difficulty with modern communications systems is ensuring the<br>
authenticity of the communicating parties. In one embodiment of the invention, the system 20 may<br>
be used to encode information such as email messages sent from one party to another. The<br>
sending party acts like the content provider/service provider and the receiving party like the<br>
customer.<br>
[0073] One way to provide extra insurance of authenticity is to send a receiving party<br>
certain random information and require that the recipient process that information and relay it back<br>
to the sender before communication of valuable information begins. For example, randomly<br>
selected sections of text from the U.S. Constitution, the Gettysburg Address, or for that matter any<br>
text from the thousands of manuscripts from the Library of Congress may be sent to the receiving<br>
party. Before any valuable content or information is sent to the receiving party, the randomly<br>
selected text must be properly decrypted and then a duplicate of the information sent back to the<br>
recipient. If the receiving party is unable to do this, then an improper communication connection<br>
has been made or the receiving party is an imposter, who may, for example, have intercepted or<br>
hacked into the communication link of the true recipient. However, without possessing the proper<br>
mutating ID, no decryption of the random text is possible.<br>
[0074] An additional security feature that may be added to the system 20 is real-time play<br>
back of content. As noted earlier, one of the problems for copyright and other legal rights holders,<br>
is that digital content can be copied (at least theoretically) an infinite number of times and the time<br>
need to make each copy is very short. For example, a CD containing seventy minutes of music<br>
can be completely copied in a few minutes. Compressed files may be copied even faster. This<br>
makes large-scale illicit copying of content very attractive to a potential criminal. Once a single<br>
copy of valuable content is obtained, hundreds and possibly thousands of pristine copies can be<br>
made quickly and then sold.<br>
[0075] In embodiments of the system 20, decoding of the content at the consumer 26 or<br>
receiver is done in a real-time fashion, meaning that play back in the system 20 occurs no faster<br>
than playback of the content as intended for the final viewer or consumer. Thus, if a movie has a<br>
running time of 2 hours and twenty minutes, recording of the content sent to the consumer takes<br>
the same amount of time, thereby discouraging large scale copying of the same. It should also be<br>
noted that the system is configured to restrict the number of decryptions that occur. Generally,<br>
only one decryption can be made by the customer. This helps reduce unauthorized copying. It<br>
should also be noted that the content may include known copy protection devices or code before it<br>
is encrypted. These devices maybe used to prevent or reduce unauthorized copying as well.<br><br>
downstream providers can be assured of having the ability to distribute a certain number of<br>
"copies" of certain content, without having to obtain approval, which could possibly be denied, by<br>
the act of refusing to supply a license, for each individual request that the downstream provider<br>
receives from end consumers (Figs. 12 and 13).<br>
[0067] As should be apparent, the system 20 and the protocol used to implement it can be<br>
used in a variety of applications beyond the secure distribution of content. Many different types of<br>
communications ranging from e-mail, video and multi-media conferencing, data and telemetry<br>
collection, and others may benefit from using all or part of the system 20 to enhance security and<br>
trust. Some of these additional applications are now discussed.<br>
Confirmation of Geographic Location<br>
[0068] As is known, innumerous human activities depend on the human participants<br>
trusting the other participants. Furthermore, participants must feel comfortable that the other<br>
participants are authentic (i.e., not imposters or frauds) and will not renege on promises or<br>
commitments made. In times when most activities took place face-to-face many concerns about<br>
authenticity were reduced. For example, before the existence of the telephone and Internet,<br>
Imposters would have to physically meet and fool any person that the imposter intended to dupe.<br>
With modem communications, it is often impossible for parties to know who thejy are actually<br>
communicating with or where the parties are located.<br>
[0069] Various biometric and other devices exist that can be used to address concerns of<br>
authenticity and trust and many of these can be used with or added into embodiments of the<br>
system 20 described. However, the system 20 also has inherent features that lessen concerns of<br>
authenticity. One of these is the ability to trace, at least to a relatively specific point, the location of<br>
customers ordering content.<br>
[0070] As noted, mutating IDs are implemented in embodiments of the invention and the<br>
consumer 26 is assigned the first mutating ID 100. Subsequent mutating IDs are assigned each<br>
time the consumer desires to obtain content. Further, each customer 26 has a decoding processor<br>
or similar device (e.g., a set top box, home computer, etc.) and the customer's address and name<br>
are associated with that hardware. Each service provider and content provider also has an actual<br>
physical location and address. Because embodiments of the system 20 rely on unraveling multi-<br>
encrypted and encapsulated identifiers, the location of a consumer can, at a minimum, be traced to<br>
the service area of the service provider of the consumer.<br>
[0071] For example, if the customer or a thief moved the customer's hardware to a<br>
location outside of the service area of the service provider 24 and requested content, the<br>
unraveling of the multi-encrypted and encapsulated identifiers would fail, as the new service<br><br>
Data and Telemetry Collection<br>
[0076] As noted, embodiments of the invention may be implemented where just three<br>
parties participate. The parties include an authenticator, a sending party (by analogy<br>
encompassing the roles and functions of the content provider and service provider), and receiving<br>
party (by analogy encompassing the roles and functions of the consumer). As noted, the system<br>
20 may be configured to implement a secure email system. As should be apparent, the system 20<br>
could also be implemented in a variety of other applications where secure communication could be<br>
useful, such as collecting data from electric and gas meters, equipment and human monitoring<br>
systems, and other data and telemetry collection applications. In general, many existing systems<br>
could be readily modified with exiting processing and communications hardware to allow<br>
communications using the multi-encrypted and encapsulated identifier architecture described<br>
herein.<br>
[0077] As can be seen from the above, the present invention provides a system and<br>
method of distributing content and information with features to protect security and the legal rights<br>
of content owners. Additional features and advantages of the invention are set forth in the<br>
attached claims. And, additional embodiments of the invention could be implemented as would be<br>
apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art by considering the discussion herein and information<br>
provided in the drawings.<br>
