				<td>FOUR CYCLE INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINE AND VEHICLE<br>
This application claims priority from Japanese Patent<br>
Application No. 2007-006375 filed on January 15, 2007.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a four-cycle<br>
internal combustion engine having an exhaust gas re-<br>
circulation device (EGR), and a vehicle including such<br>
four-cycle internal combustion engine.<br>
2.	Description of the Related Art<br>
Heretofore, four-cycle internal combustion engines<br>
having an exhaust gas re-circulation device (EGR) for<br>
returning part of exhaust gas (burnt gasses) to a<br>
combustion chamber are widely used. The EGR slows down<br>
combustion of a fuel/air mixture in a combustion chamber,<br>
lowers the highest combustion temperature, and to reduce<br>
nitrogen oxides (NOX) .<br>
For example, an EGR including a gas storage chamber<br>
is known, in which an auxiliary exhaust valve is provided<br>
at an auxiliary exhaust port coupled to a combustion<br>
chamber and part of burnt gasses (EGR gas) discharged via<br>
the auxiliary exhaust port is stored in the gas storage<br>
chamber (see JP-A-05-086992 (page 6, FIGs. 17 and 18),<br>
1<br><br>
for example) . In such an EGR, EGR gas stored in the<br>
storage chamber is returned to the combustion chamber at<br>
a predetermined timing.<br>
A four-cycle internal combustion engine having the<br>
EGR disclosed in JP-A-05-086992 requires a main exhaust<br>
port and a main exhaust valve, and an auxiliary exhaust<br>
port and an auxiliary exhaust valve in addition.<br>
Therefore, there is a problem that the structure of a<br>
cylinder head is complicated and production cost becomes<br>
expensive especially with a multi-cylinder four-cycle<br>
internal combustion engine having a plurality of cylinder<br>
sections.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Therefore, the present invention is made in<br>
consideration of the foregoing problem. The object of<br>
the present invention is to provide a four-cycle internal<br>
combustion engine having a plurality of cylinder sections<br>
in which a structure of a cylinder head is not<br>
complicated, a fuel consumption can be improved, and<br>
nitrogen oxides (NOx) can be reduced, and also provide a<br>
vehicle including the four-cycle internal combustion<br>
engine described above.<br>
To solve the above problems, the present invention<br>
has following features. A first aspect of the present<br>
2<br><br>
invention is a four-cycle internal combustion engine<br>
(engine 100), including a plurality of cylinder sections<br>
(for example, first cylinder section 110) each including<br>
a cylinder (for example, cylinder 110S) and an exhaust<br>
passage (for example, exhaust port 110ex) in<br>
communication with the inside of the cylinder, in which<br>
the cylinder section is in communication with the exhaust<br>
passage and has a cylinder-sided passage section (for<br>
example, cylinder-sided passage section 151) in<br>
communication with the exhaust passage, through which<br>
burnt gasses pass, and the engine further including an<br>
inter-cylinder passage (inter-cylinder passage 150) in<br>
communication with a plurality of the cylinder-sided<br>
passage sections.<br>
With such a four-cycle internal combustion engine, an<br>
internal EGR amount can be made larger than those in<br>
conventional cases, and thus a pumping loss decreases.<br>
Also, the four-cycle internal combustion engine has the<br>
cylinder-sided passage in communication with the exhaust<br>
passage through which burnt gasses pass, and the inter-<br>
cylinder passage in communication with a plurality of the<br>
cylinder-sided passages. Therefore, differently from a<br>
conventional EGR, the engine needs to have no special<br>
intake or exhaust passage in communication with a gas<br>
storage chamber, or an intake and exhaust valve.<br>
3<br><br>
Namely, with such features, the structure around a<br>
cylinder head is not complicated in the case that the<br>
engine has a plurality of cylinder sections, a fuel<br>
consumption can be improved, and nitrogen oxides (NOx) can<br>
be reduced.<br>
A second aspect of the present invention is the four-<br>
cycle internal combustion engine according to the first<br>
aspect, in which a direction in which the burnt gasses<br>
are introduced into the cylinder-sided passage section is<br>

cylinder, as seen from an axial view of the cylinder.<br>
A third aspect of the present invention is the four-<br>
cycle internal combustion engine according to the first<br>

which the exhaust valve of one cylinder section (for<br>
example, first cylinder section 110) is opened overlaps<br>
at least partially another time period during which the<br>
exhaust valve (exhaust valve 132) of another cylinder<br>
section (third cylinder section 130).<br>
A fourth aspect of the present invention is the four-<br>
cycle internal combustion engine according to the third<br>
aspect, further including: a crankshaft (crankshaft 160),<br>
and a valve actuating mechanism (sprocket 170 and cam<br>
4<br><br>
chain 180) for opening or closing the exhaust valve at a<br>
predetermined period with rotation of the crankshaft.<br>
A fifth aspect of the present invention is the four-<br>
cycle internal combustion engine according to the second<br>
aspect, in which the cylinder section includes an intake<br>
passage (for example, intake port 110in) in communication<br>
with the inside of the cylinder; a direction in which a<br>
fluid is taken into the inside of the cylinder via the<br>
intake passage is the direction along the periphery of<br>
the cylinder, as seen from the axial view of the<br>
cylinder; and a direction in which the burnt gasses are<br>
introduced corresponds to a direction in which the fluid<br>
is swirled about an center axis of the cylinder.<br>
A sixth aspect of the present invention is the four-<br>
cycle internal combustion engine according to the third<br>
aspect, in which the cylinder section includes an intake<br>
passage (for example, intake port 110in) in communication<br>
with the inside of the cylinder (for example, cylinder<br>
110S) , and an intake valve (intake valve 111) for opening<br>
or closing the intake passage, and a period during which<br>
the exhaust valve opens overlaps a period during which<br>
the intake valve opens.<br>
A seventh aspect of the present invention is the<br>
four-cycle internal combustion engine according to the<br>
first aspect, in which the inter-cylinder passage extends<br>
5<br><br>
along an arrangement of the plurality of the cylinder<br>
sections, and the cylinder-sided passage section branches<br>
from the inter-cylinder passage and extends toward the<br>
exhaust passage.<br>
An eighth aspect of the present invention is the<br>
four-cycle internal combustion engine according to the<br>
first aspect, in which the cylinder-sided passage section<br>
is directed to an exhaust passage opening (an air gap<br>
inside an exhaust valve seat 112S) that is open to the<br>
inside of the cylinder.<br>
A ninth aspect of the present invention is the four-<br>
cycle internal combustion engine in accordance with the<br>
first aspect, in which the exhaust passage is formed in a<br>

present invention will be described with reference to the<br>
accompanying drawings. The same or similar reference<br>
numerals and symbols are given to the same or similar<br>
parts in expressions of the following drawings. However,<br>
attention should be paid on that the drawings are<br>
schematic figures and the proportions of the objects are<br>
different from the reality.<br>
Therefore, specific sizes and so forth should be<br>
determined referring the following descriptions. Also,<br>
it is a matter of course that the relationships between<br>
sizes or the proportions of the objects are different<br>
mutually between the drawings.<br>
(1) General Construction of the Whole<br>
FIG. 1 is a left side view of a motorcycle 10 as a<br>
vehicle of this embodiment. As shown in FIG. 1, the<br>
motorcycle 10 includes a front wheel 20 and a rear wheel<br>
8<br><br>
70. An engine 100 produces a driving force and drives<br>
the rear wheel 70.<br>
The engine 100 is a four-cycle engine. A sprocket<br>
170 rotating together with a camshaft (not shown) is<br>
disposed above a cylinder head 110sh (not shown in FIG. 1,<br>
see FIG. 3) of the engine 100. In this embodiment, the<br>
engine 100 structures a four-cycle internal combustion<br>
engine.<br>
A cam chain 180 is engaged with a crankshaft 160,<br>
which is actually a sprocket (not shown) rotating<br>
together with the crankshaft 160, and the sprocket 170.<br>
An intake pipe 30 in communication with intake ports<br>
110in to 140in (not shown in FIG. 1, see FIG. 2) is<br>
coupled to the engine 100. Also, an exhaust pipe 40 in<br>
communication with exhaust ports 110ex to 140ex is<br>
coupled to the engine 100.<br>
(2) Construction of Four-Cycle Internal Combustion<br>
Engine<br>
FIG. 2 is a plan view of the engine 100 structuring a<br>
four-cycle internal combustion engine in this embodiment.<br>
Specifically, FIG. 2 is a plan view of the engine 100 in<br>
a position along the F2-F2 line shown in FIG. 1. FIG. 3<br>
is a cross sectional view along the F3-F3 line shown in<br>
FIG. 2.<br>
As shown in FIG.2, the engine 100 includes four<br>
9<br><br>
cylinder sections, specifically, a first cylinder section<br>
110, a second cylinder section 120, a third cylinder<br>
section 130, and a fourth cylinder section 140. The<br>
first cylinder section 110, the second cylinder section<br>
120, the third cylinder section 130, and the fourth<br>
cylinder section 140 are arranged along the crankshaft<br>
160. That is, the engine 100 is an four-cylinder in-line<br>
engine.<br>
The first cylinder section 110 has a cylinder 110S.<br>
Specifically, the cylinder 110S is formed with a cylinder<br>
block HOsb (see FIG. 3) . A piston 113 is disposed<br>
inside the cylinder 110S.<br>
The first cylinder section 110 has the intake port<br>
110in and the exhaust port 110ex. Specifically, the<br>
intake port 110in and the exhaust port 110ex are formed<br>
with the cylinder head 110sh (see FIG. 3).<br>
The intake port 110in is in communication with the<br>
inside of the cylinder 110S. In this embodiment, the<br>
intake port 110in configures an intake passage.<br>
Similarly to the intake port 110in, the exhaust port<br>
110ex is in communication with the inside of the cylinder<br>
110S. In this embodiment, the exhaust port 110ex<br>
configures an exhaust passage.<br>
As shown in FIG. 3, the intake port 110in and the<br>
exhaust port 110ex are formed in the cylinder head 110sh.<br>
10<br><br>
An intake valve 111 is disposed at the intake port 110in.<br>
The intake valve 111 opens or closes the intake port<br>
110in at a predetermined period.<br>
An exhaust valve 112 is disposed at the exhaust port<br>
110ex. The exhaust valve 112 opens or closes the exhaust<br>
port 110ex at a predetermined period.<br>
A coil spring (not shown) for urging the intake valve<br>
111 in a direction that it closes the intake port 110in<br>
is mounted on the intake valve 111. Similarly, a coil<br>
spring (not shown) for urging the exhaust valve 112 in a<br>
direction that it closes the exhaust port 110ex is<br>
mounted on the exhaust valve 112.<br>
That is, the intake valve 111 opens or closes the<br>
intake port 110in at a predetermined period by rotation<br>
of the camshaft together with the sprocket 170.<br>
Similarly, the exhaust valve 112 opens or closes the<br>
exhaust port 110ex at a predetermined period by rotation<br>
of the camshaft together with the sprocket 170. In this<br>
embodiment, the sprocket 170 and the cam chain 180 (see<br>
FIG. 1) configure a valve actuating mechanism.<br>
The second cylinder section 120, the third cylinder<br>
section 130, and the fourth cylinder section 140 each<br>
have a construction similar to the first cylinder section<br>
110.<br>
Namely, the second cylinder section 120 has a<br>
11<br><br>
cylinder 120S, the intake port 120in, and the exhaust<br>
port 120ex. An intake valve 121 is disposed at the<br>
intake port 120in. An exhaust valve 122 is disposed at<br>
the exhaust port 120ex.<br>
The third cylinder section 130 has a cylinder 130S,<br>
the intake port 130in, and the exhaust port 130ex. An<br>
intake valve 131 is disposed at the intake port 130in.<br>
An exhaust valve 132 is disposed at the exhaust port<br>
130ex. Similarly, the fourth cylinder section 140 has a<br>
cylinder 140S, the intake port 140in, and the exhaust<br>
port 140ex. An intake valve 141 is disposed at the<br>
intake port 140in. An exhaust valve 142 is disposed at<br>
the exhaust port 140ex.<br>
Each of the first cylinder section 110, the second<br>
cylinder section 120, the third cylinder section 130, and<br>
the fourth cylinder section 140 has a cylinder-sided<br>
passage in communication with the exhaust port, through<br>
which burnt gasses (EGR gas) pass. For example, the<br>
first cylinder section 110 has a cylinder-sided passage<br>
151. Similarly, the second cylinder section 120, the<br>
third cylinder section 130, and the fourth cylinder<br>
section 140 have cylinder-sided passages 152, 153, and<br>
154, respectively.<br>
The cylinder-sided passages 151 to 154 are in<br>
communication with an inter-cylinder passage 150. That<br>
12<br><br>
is, the inter-cylinder passage 150 is in communication<br>
with a plurality of the cylinder-sided passages. The<br>
inter-cylinder passage 150 is formed along the axial<br>
direction of the crankshaft 160. Namely, the inter-<br>
cylinder passage 150 extends in a direction that a<br>
plurality of the cylinders is arranged.<br>
As shown in FIG. 2, the cylinder-sided passages 151<br>
to 154 are obliquely coupled to the inter-cylinder<br>
passage 150 formed along the axial direction of the<br>
crankshaft 160 in a plan view of the engine 100. The<br>
cylinder-sided passages 151 through 154 branch out from<br>
the inter-cylinder passage 150, and extend toward the<br>
exhaust ports 110ex to 140ex.<br>
As shown in FIG. 3, an opening 151a of the cylinder-<br>
sided passage 151 adjoins the top end of an annular<br>
exhaust valve seat 112S. Burnt gasses discharged from<br>
the opening 151a toward the cylinder-sided passage 151<br>
are supplied to another cylinder (specifically, the third<br>
cylinder section 130) via the cylinder-sided passage 151<br>
and the inter-cylinder passage 150. The cylinder-sided<br>
passage 151 is directed to an opening portion of the<br>
exhaust port 110ex that is open to the cylinder 110S,<br>
specifically a gap inside the exhaust valve seat 112S.<br>
The inter-cylinder passage 150 and the cylinder-sided<br>
passage 151 are formed in the cylinder head 110sh on the<br>
13<br><br>
side that the exhaust port 110ex is formed.<br>
Burnt gasses supplied from another cylinder section<br>
(specifically, the second cylinder section 120) via the<br>
inter-cylinder passage 150 and the cylinder-sided passage<br>
151 are introduced into the inside of the cylinder 110S<br>
through the opening 151a. The direction of the cylinder-<br>
sided passage 151, specifically, a direction of the burnt<br>
gasses introduced into the cylinder 110S through the<br>
opening 151a, is a direction along a periphery 110p of<br>
the cylinder 110S (see FIG. 2) viewing the cylinder 110S<br>
in its axial direction (the direction shown in FIG. 2).<br>
The cylinder head 110sh and the cylinder block 110sb<br>
are coupled together through a gasket 190. That is, the<br>
cylinder head 110sh has a face mating with the cylinder<br>
block 110sb, which is a plain surface contacting the<br>
gasket 190 in this embodiment.<br>
Further, the inter-cylinder passage 150 has an<br>
opening 150a open to the face mating with the cylinder<br>
block 110sb. The inter-cylinder passage 150 forms a<br>
closed space in such a manner that the cylinder head<br>
110sh and the cylinder block HOsb are combined together<br>
to block the opening 150a.<br>
The volume (a cross sectional area in the direction<br>
of a smaller diameter) of the inter-cylinder passage 150<br>
is larger than that of the cylinder-sided passage 151<br>
14<br><br>
(152, 153 or 154) . In addition, the cylinder-sided<br>
passages 152, 153, 154 each have a shape similar to the<br>
cylinder-sided passage 151.<br>
(Operation of Four-Cycle Internal Combustion Engine)<br>
Next, an operation of the engine 100 of the four-<br>
cycle internal combustion engine in this embodiment will<br>
be described. Specifically, descriptions will be made<br>
about a flow of burnt gasses occurring with operations of<br>
the intake valves and the exhaust valves of the engine<br>
100.<br>
FIG. 4 shows operation timings of the intake valves<br>
and the exhaust valves of the engine 100. As shown in<br>
FIG. 4, the engine 100 repeats explosions in order of the<br>
first cylinder section 110, the second cylinder section<br>
120, the fourth cylinder section 140, and the third<br>
cylinder section 130 (see "exhaust valve open" and<br>
"intake valve open" timings in the figure).<br>
In FIG. 4, arrows show flows of burnt gasses. For<br>
example, when the exhaust valve 112 of the first cylinder<br>
section 110 is open, burnt gasses flowing from the<br>
cylinder 110S into the cylinder-sided passage 151 are<br>
supplied to the cylinder 130S of the third cylinder<br>
section 130 via the inter-cylinder passage 150 and the<br>
cylinder-sided passage 153. Further, in FIG. 4, as an<br>
arrow directs toward the exhaust valve 112 of the first<br>
15<br><br>
cylinder section 110, part of the burnt gasses flowing<br>
from the cylinder 110S into the cylinder-sided passage<br>
151 returns from the cylinder-sided passage 151 to the<br>
cylinder 110S.<br>
A period during which the exhaust valve of any one of<br>
the cylinder sections opens, for example, the exhaust<br>
valve 112 opens in the first cylinder section 110<br>
overlaps at least partially a period during which the<br>
exhaust valve of the cylinder section other than the<br>
first cylinder section 110, specifically, the exhaust<br>
valve 132 of the third cylinder section 130 opens.<br>
That is, the engine 100 includes the four cylinder<br>
sections (the first cylinder section 110, the second<br>
cylinder section 120, the third cylinder section 130, and<br>
the fourth cylinder section 140) . A period during which<br>
an exhaust valve (the exhaust valve 112) in any one of<br>
the cylinder sections (for example, the first cylinder<br>
section 110) opens overlaps at least partially a period<br>
during which an exhaust valve (the exhaust valve 132)<br>
opens.<br>
Also, in each of the cylinder sections, a period<br>
during which the exhaust valve opens overlaps a period<br>
during which the intake valve opens.<br>
(Action and Effect)<br>
With the engine 100, an internal EGR amount can be<br>
16<br><br>
made larger than that in a conventional exhaust gas re-<br>
circulation device (EGR) , and thus a pumping loss can be<br>
reduced. Therefore, a throttle valve (not shown) of the<br>
engine 100 is set more open, thereby improving the fuel<br>
consumption.<br>
The engine 100 has the cylinder-sided passages 151 to<br>
154 in communication with the exhaust ports through which<br>
burnt gasses pass, and the inter-cylinder passage 150 in<br>
communication with the cylinder-sided passages 151 to 154.<br>
Therefore, differently from a conventional EGR, the<br>
engine needs to have no special intake and exhaust<br>
passage in communication with a gas storage chamber, or<br>
no intake and exhaust valve.<br>
That is, with the engine 100, in the case that the<br>
engine has a plurality of cylinders (the cylinders 110S,<br>
120S, 130S, 140S), the construction of the cylinder head<br>
110sh is not complicated, the fuel consumption can be<br>
improved, and nitrogen oxides (NOX) can be reduced.<br>
In this embodiment, the direction of burnt gasses<br>
discharged from the cylinder-sided passage into the<br>
inside of the cylinder is the direction along the<br>
periphery (for example, the periphery 110p) of the<br>
cylinder. Therefore, burnt gasses can be discharged to<br>
swirl along the periphery of the cylinder. That is, in<br>
the engine 100, unburned gasses in a quenching area (not<br>
17<br><br>
shown) are reduced by the burnt gasses, and thus the<br>
amount of HC production can be reduced. Further, in the<br>
engine 100, the burnt gasses are discharged (refluxed)<br>
and swirled inside of the cylinder, and thus burnt gasses<br>
flowing near the periphery and a fresh fuel/air mixture<br>
flowing from the intake port can be stratified.<br>
Namely, it improves an EGR rate (a value obtained by<br>
dividing an amount of burnt gasses refluxed into the<br>
inside of the cylinder by an amount of an intake air) .<br>
Therefore, this contributes for a further improvement in<br>
the fuel consumption and cleanup of exhaust gas.<br>
In this embodiment, a period during which an exhaust<br>
valve of a certain cylinder section, for example the<br>
exhaust valve 112 of the first cylinder section 110 opens<br>
overlaps a period during which an exhaust valve of a<br>
cylinder section other than the first cylinder section<br>
110, specifically, the exhaust valve 132 of the third<br>
cylinder section 130 opens. That is, burnt gasses<br>
produced in the certain cylinder section are immediately<br>
supplied to the another cylinder section. Therefore,<br>
this contributes for a further improvement in the fuel<br>
consumption and cleanup of exhaust gas.<br>
(Other Embodiments)<br>
As foregoing, the content of the present invention is<br>
disclosed with an embodiment of the present invention.<br>
18<br><br>
However, it should not be recognized that the<br>
descriptions and drawings constituting part of this<br>
disclosure limits the present invention. The skilled in<br>
this art will appreciate that various alternative<br>
embodiments may be made obviously from the disclosure.<br>
For example, the direction of introducing a fluid,<br>
specifically a fuel/air mixture, into the inside of the<br>
cylinder via the intake port, is along the periphery of<br>
the cylinder 110S viewing the cylinder 110S in its axial<br>
direction. The direction of introducing burnt gasses can<br>
be the same as a swirl direction of the fuel/air mixture<br>
in the case that the axis of the cylinder 110S is the<br>
rotational center. For example, in the first cylinder<br>
section 110 shown in FIG. 2, the shape of the intake port<br>
110in can be modified into a shape shown by the one-dot<br>
chain-line so that the direction of introducing a<br>
fuel/air mixture inside of the cylinder 110S via the<br>
intake port 110in is made generally the same as the<br>
direction of introducing the burnt gasses.<br>
In this case, it is preferred that the period during<br>
which the exhaust valve opens overlaps a period during<br>
which the intake valve opens. With a modification in<br>
such a manner, a swirl flow of burnt gasses discharged<br>
inside of the cylinder can be enhanced.<br>
While the period during which the exhaust valve of a<br>
19<br><br>
certain cylinder section opens overlaps the period during<br>
which the exhaust valve of a cylinder other than the<br>
certain cylinder opens in the above embodiment, the both<br>
periods do not necessarily need to overlap.<br>
In the above embodiment, the direction of discharging<br>
burnt gasses from the cylinder-sided passage into the<br>
inside of the cylinder is along the periphery (for<br>
example, the periphery 110p) of the cylinder. However,<br>
the direction of discharging burnt gasses does not<br>
necessarily need to be along the periphery of the<br>
cylinder.<br>
In the above embodiment, the engine 100 is an in-line<br>
four-cylinder engine. However, the engine 100 is not<br>
limited to the in-line four-cylinder engine, but can be<br>
an in-line six-cylinder engine, or a V-type eight-<br>
cylinder engine. Further, the engine 100 does not<br>
necessarily have to be an even number cylinder in-line<br>
engine. For example, the engine 100 can be a three-<br>
cylinder engine or a five-cylinder engine.<br>
In the above embodiments, the descriptions are made<br>
with the motorcycle 10 as an example. However, it is a<br>
matter of course that the present invention can be<br>
applied to vehicles other than a motorcycle, for example,<br>
an engine (a four-cycle internal combustion engine)<br>
carried on a four wheeled motor vehicle.<br>
20<br><br>
It is therefore a matter of course that the present<br>
invention includes various embodiments that are not<br>
described in this document. Therefore, it is intended<br>
that the scope of the present invention be limited solely<br>
by the specific inventive elements valid in the above<br>
descriptions according to claims.<br>
