INDAZOLES SUBSTITUTED WITH AN ANTI-CANCEROUS ACTIVITY<br>
The present invention relates in particular to novel chemical compounds, particularly novel substituted indazoles, to the compositions containing them, and to their use as medicinal products.<br>
More particularly, the invention relates to novel specific indazoles exhibiting anticancer activity via the modulation of the activity of proteins, in particular of kinases.<br>
To date, most of the commercial compounds used in chemotherapy pose considerable problems of side effects and of tolerance in patients. These effects may be limited insofar as the medicinal products used act selectively on cancer cells, with the exclusion of healthy cells. One of the solutions for limiting the undesirable effects of chemotherapy may therefore consist in using medicinal products which act on metabolic pathways or elements constituting these pathways, expressed mainly in cancer cells, and which would be expressed very little or not at all in healthy cells.<br>
Protein kinases are a family of enzymes which catalyze the phosphorylation of hydroxyl groups of specific protein residues such as tyrosine, serine or threonine residues. Such phosphorylations can widely modify the function of proteins; thus, protein kinases play an importane role in regulating a large variety of cell processes, including in particular metabolism, cell proliferation, cell differentiation, cell migration or cell survival. Among the various cellular functions in which the activity of a protein kinase is involved, certain processes represent attractive targets for treating cancer-related diseases and also other diseases.<br>
Thus, one of the objects of the present invention is to provide compositions having anticancer activity, acting in particular with respect to kinases. Among the kinases for which modulation of the activity is sought, FAK (Focal Adhesion Kinase) is preferred.<br>
FAK is a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase which plays an important role in transduction of the'signal transmitted by integrins, a family of heterodimeric<br><br>
cell adhesion receptors. FAK and the integrins are colocalized in perimembrane structures called adhesion plaques. It has been shown, in many cell types, that the activation of FAK, and also phosphorylation thereof on tyrosine residues and in particular autophosphorylation thereof on tyrosine 397, are dependent on the binding of integrins to their extracellular ligands and are therefore induced during cell adhesion [L. Komberg, et al. J. Biol. Chem. 267(33): 23439-442. (1992)]. The autophosphorylation of FAK, on tyrosine 397, represents a binding site for another tyrosine kinase, Src, via its SH2 domain [Schaller et al. Mol. Cell. Biol. 14 :1680-1688. 1994; Xing et al. Mol. Cell. Biol. 5:413-421. 1994]. Src can then phosphorylate FAK on tyrosine 925, thus recruiting the Grb2 adaptor protein and inducing, in certain cells, activation of the ras and MAP Kinase pathway involved in the control of cell proliferation [Schlaepfer et al. Nature; 372:786-791. 1994; Schlaepfer et al. Prog. Biophy. Mol. Biol. 71:435-478. 1999; Schlaepfer and Hunter, J. Biol. Chem. 272:13189-13195. 1997]. The activation of FAK can also induce the jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling pathway and result in the progression of cells fo the G1 phase of the cell cycle [Oktay et al., J. Cell. Biol.145:1461-1469. 1999]. Phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase (PI3-kinase) also binds to FAK on tyrosine 397, and this interaction might be necessary for the activation of PI3-kinase [Chen and Guan, Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA. 91: 10148-10152. 1994; Ling et al. J. Cell. Biochem. 73:533-544. 1999]. The FAK/Src complex phosphorylates various substrates, such as paxillin and p130CAS in fibroblasts [Vuori era/. Mol. Cell. Biol. 16: 2606-2613.1996].<br>
The results of many studies support the hypothesis that FAK inhibitors might be used in the treatment of cancer. Studies have suggested that FAK may play an important role in cell proliferation and/or survival in vitro. For example, in CHO cells, some authors have demonstrated that overexpression of p125FAK leads to an acceleration of the G1 to S transition, suggesting that p125FAK promotes cell proliferation [J.-H Zhao et al. J. Cell Biol. 143:1997-2008. 1998]. Other authors have shown that tumor cells treated with FAK antisense oligonucleotides lose their adhesion and enter into apoptosis (Xu et al, Cell Growth Differ. 4:413-418. 1996). It has also been demonstrated that FAK promotes cell migration in vitro. Thus, fibroblasts deficient for the expression of FAK (mice which are knockout for FAK) exhibit a rounded morphology and deficiencies in cell migration in response to chemotactic signals, and these<br><br>
deficiencies are eliminated by reexpression of FAK [DJ. Sieg et a/., J. Cell Science. 112:2677-91. 1999]. Overexpression of the C-terminal domain of FAK (FRNK) blocks the extension of adherent cells and decreases cell migration in vitro [A. Richardson and J.T. Parsons Nature. 380:538-540. 1996]. Overexpression of FAK in CHO or COS cells or in human astrocytoma cells promotes migration of the cells. The involvement of FAK in the promotion of cell proliferation and migration in many cell types in vitro suggests the potential role of FAK in neoplastic processes. A recent study has effectively demonstrated an increase in the proliferation of tumor cells in vivo after induction of FAK expression in human astrocytoma cells [L.A. Cary L.A. et ai. J. Cell Sci. 109:1787-94. 1996; D. Wang et ai J. Cell Sci. 113:4221-4230. 2000]. In addition, immunohistochemical studies of human biopsies have demonstrated that FAK is overexpressed in prostate cancer, breast cancer, thyroid cancer, colon cancer melanoma, brain cancer and lung cancer, the level of FAK expression being directly correlated with the tumors exhibiting the most agressive phenotype [TM Weiner, et ai Lancet. 342(8878):1024-1025. 1993 ; Owens et a/. Cancer Research. 55:2752-2755. 1995; K. Maung et a/. Oncogene. 18:6824-6828. 1999; D Wang et a/. J. Cell Sci. 113:4221-4230. 2000].<br>
Indazoles are not very common in pharmaceutical products on the market. Included among the indazoles substituted at position 5 are essentially sulfonic acids, which are widely used in the field of photosensitization, with a predilection in the photographic field. Moreover, a sulfonamide is known, from JP 62025747, which claims /V-(1H-indazol-5-yl)-methanesulfonamide as a film preserver and inhibitor of shadow formation. A therapeutic use is neither described nor envisioned here.<br>
The following documents propose the therapeutic use of indazoles substituted<br>
at position 5.<br>
Patent application WO 99/64004 discloses quinazoline derivatives, some of which contain an A/-(1H-indazol-5-yi)sulfonarnido substituent. These products are reputed to be of use for inhibiting a cGMP phosphodiesterase, and for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. The use of these products in oncology is not envisioned.<br><br>
US patent 5 880 151 claims pentafluorophenylsulfonamide derivatives for treating atherosclerosis. This patent gives an example of indazole substituted at position 5 with a pentafluorophenylsulfonamide group. The same series of products is claimed in application WO 98/05315, for use as anti-proliferative agents, and also for treating inflammatory diseases, myocardial infarction, glomerular nephritis, transplant rejection, and infectious diseases such as HIV infections and malaria. In particular, product 15, the preparation of which is described on page 37, is the only indazole which appears in the patent application. The use of these products as kinase inhibitors is not mentioned. On the contrary, these products are aimed at inhibiting tubulin polymerization, which is a result of different mechanisms of inhibition of cell proliferation.<br>
Patent application WO 00/73264 claims cell proliferation inhibitors, and in particular tubulin polymerization inhibitors. That patent application gives the preparation of many products, including a single indazole (page 42, example 34: /V-CIH-indazol-S-yl^S^.S-trimethoxybenzenesulfonamide). This product is tested (page 20) at a concentration of 100 yM against NCI-H460 cells (18.5% growth inhibition) and HCT-15 cells (47.6% growth inhibition). The activity of this product is very modest compared to that obtained for the other compounds tested. In addition, it should be noted that the use of these products as kinase inhibitors is neither described nor suggested, the applicant placing the emphasis particularly on the 3,4,5-trimethoxybenzenesulfonamide group to which it is possible to add a large number of substituents, including an indazole.<br>
Patent application WO 01/53268 claims 3,5-disubstituted indazoles as CDK kinase* inhibitors, and for inhibiting cell proliferation. The substituents at position 5 are always hydrocarbon-based chains or cyclic, aromatic or heteroaromatic groups.<br>
Patent application WO 02/10137 claims indazoles substituted at positions 3 and 5 with- many different groups. Out of the 438 examples of indazoles described, only example 42 is an indazole substituted at position 5 with a phenylsulfonylamino group. The products described here are of use for inhibiting the JNK protein.<br><br>
Patent application WO 02/083648, published on October 24, 2002, claims indazoles which inhibit JNK protein. In that application, only the products 1-18 to I-20 and I-64 to 1-71 are 5-sulfonylaminoindazoles substituted at position 3 with an aryl group.<br>
Patent application WO 03/004488, published on January 16, 2003, discloses 2-(3-benzimidazolyl)indazoles of use as inhibitors of tyrosine and serine/threonine kinases. These products are indifferently substituted at positions 4 to 7 of the indazole and/or the imidazole. Examples 843 to 854 are indazoles substituted at position 3 with a benzimidazol-2-yl substituent, and at position 5 with an (alkyl/ary!)sulfonamido substituent. All these benzimidazoles are substituted at position 6 with N,N-dialkylamino substituents. No test on FAK is given. No relationship between the activity of the compounds and their structure is discussed.<br>
Now, surprisingly, it has been found that indazoles substituted at position 5 with a series of substituents Z-X- as defined below, and optionally substituted at position 3, exhibit considerable kinase-inhibiting activity, in particular against FAK.<br>
Another of the merits of the invention is to have found that substitution of the indazole at position 5 with a suitable group leads to considerable inhibition of FAK kinase, even when the indazole is not substituted on any other position, in particular at position 3.<br>
Another of the merits of the invention is to have found that substitution of the indazole ring at a position other than position 5 systematically leads to a decrease in activity against the kinases tested here. Thus, when a series of substituents Z-X- is placed at one of positions 1, 4, 6 or 7 of the indazole ring, this results in a very large loss of activity which then makes the product unsuitable for use as a kinase inhibitor, particularly FAK. In addition, insofar as the indazole is substituted at position 5 with a suitable group Z-X- as claimed, it is possibile to substituted the indazole at position 6 with a small substituent, such as a C1-C3 alkyl group, although this is not preferred.<br>
In addition, one of the merits of the invention is to have demonstrated that, even when the indazole is correctly substituted with a suitable group X, it is<br><br>
essential for the nitrogen at position 1 of the indazole not to be substituted, in order to conserve satisfactory inhibitory activity.<br>
These products correspond to the following formula (I):<br><br>
in which :<br>
a)	R1 is selected.from the group consisting of H, halogen, alkyl, alkylene [sic], alkynyl, aryl, heteroaryl, cycloalkyl, heterocyclyl, substituted alkyl, substituted alkylene [sic], substituted alkynyl, substituted aryl, substituted heteroaryl, substituted cycloalkyl, substituted heterocyclyl, CN, 0(R2), OC(0)(R2), OC(0)N(R2)(R3), OS(02)(R2), N(R2)(R3), N=C(R2)(R3),	N(R2)C(0)(R3),	N(R2)C(0)0(R3), N(R4)C(0)N(R2)(R3), N(R4)C(S)N(R2)(R3),	N(R2)S(02)(R3), C(0)(R2), C(0)0(R2), C(0)N(R2)(R3),	C(=N(R3))(R2), C(=N(OR3))(R2), S(R2), S(0)(R2), S(02)(R2), S(02)N(R2)(R3), in which each R2, R3 and R4 is independently selected from the group consisting of H, alkyl, aryl, heteroaryl, cycloalkyl, heterocyclyl, substituted alkyl, substituted aryl, substituted heteroaryl, substituted cycloalkyl, substituted heterocyclyl, alkylene [sic], substituted alkylene [sic];<br>
b)	X is selected from the group consisting of S(02)-NH ; S(02)-0 ; NH-S(02); 0-S(02);<br>
c)	Z is selected from the group consisting of alkyl, aryl,. heteroaryl, cycloalkyl, heterocyclyl, substituted alkyl, substituted aryl, substituted heteroaryl, substituted cycloalkyl, substituted heterocyclyl;<br>
with the proviso that the product of formula (I) is not one of the following compounds :<br><br><br>
in which alkyl is n-propyi, and in which Ra and Rb are independently selected from the group consisting of NH2l N02 and CI, or Ra and Rb form a ring -NH-CH=N-;<br><br>
X may advantageously be S(02)-NH or S(02)-0.<br>
It has been observed that, quite unexpectedly, products of general formula (I) in which Z-X- is Z-S020- exhibit levels of activity similar to those observed when Z-X- is Z-S02Nhk<br>
Preferably, R1 will not be H.<br>
Specifically, another of the merits of the invention is to have discovered that substitution of the indazole at position 3 with a group R1 other than H significantly improves the inhibitory properties against kinases.<br>
Z may advantageously be substituted aryl. More preferably, Z may be phenyl substituted with one to three substituents.<br><br>
According to a very preferred variant, Z may be phenyl substituted with one or more substituents selected from the group consisting of: 3-fluoro ; 3,4-dichloro ; 3,4-difIuoro ; 2-methylsulfonyl.<br>
Preferably, R1 may be selected from the group consisting of H, CH3, C2-C6 alkyl, CI, Br, I, CN, C(0)NH(R2), NHC(0)(R2), aryl, substituted aryl, alkylene [sic] and substituted alkylene [sic].<br>

The products of the invention are of use as agents for inhibiting a reaction catalyzed by a kinase. FAK is a kinase for which the products of the invention will be particularly useful as inhibitors. The products of the invention may also be of use as inhibitors of Aurora and/or KDR kinases. More generally, the products of the invention may also be of use as inhibitors of Src, Tie2, IGF1R, CDK2 and CDK4 kinases, preferably Src and Tie2 kinases.<br><br>
Reasons for which these kinases are chosen are given below: KDR<br>
KDR (Kinase insert Domain Receptor), also known as VEGF-R2 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor 2), is expressed only in endothelial cells. This receptor binds to the angiogenic growth factor VEGF and thus acts as a mediator to a transduction signal via the activation of its intracellular kinase domain. Direct inhibition of the kinase activity of VEGF-R2 makes it possible to reduce the phenomenon of angiogenesis in the presence of exogenous VEGF (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor:) (Strawn et al., Cancer Research, 1996, vol. 56, p.3540-3545). This process has been demonstrated in particular using VEGF-R2 mutants (Millauer et al., Cancer Research, 1996, vol. 56, p.1615-1620). The VEGF-R2 receptor does not appear to have any function in adults other than that related to the angiogenic activity of VEGF. Consequently, a selective inhibitor of the kinase activity of VEGF-R2 should show only slight toxicity.<br>
In addition to this central role in the angiogenic dynamic process, recent results suggest that the expression of VEGF contributes to the survival of tumor cells after chemotherapy and radiotherapy, underlining the potential synergy of KDR inhibitors with other agents (Lee et al. Cancer Research, 2000, vol. 60, p.5565-5570).<br>
Aurora2<br>
Many proteins involved in chromosome segregation and spindle assembly have been identified in yeast and drosophilia. Disruption of these proteins leads to non-segregation of chromosomes and to monopolar or disorganized spindles. Among these proteins, certain kinases, including Aurora and IpH, originating respectively from S. cerevisiae and from drosophilia, are necessary for chromosome segregation and centrosome separation. A human analog of yeast IpH has recently been cloned and characterized by various laboratories. This kinase, called aurora2, STK15 or BTAK, belongs to the serine/threonine kinase family. Bischoff et al. have shown that Aurora2 is oncogenic and is amplified in human colorectal cancers (EMBO Jf 1998, 17, 3052-3065). This has also been exemplified in cancers involving epithelial tumors such as breast cancer.<br><br>
Src<br>
It has been noted that the Src kinase, involved in many signaling cascades, is often activated or overexpressed in many types of cancer, such as colon cancer or breast cancer (MM Moasser et at. Cancer Res. 1999. 59 :6245-6152 ; Wiener et al. Clin. Cancer Res. 1999. 5 :2164-2170). in addition, Src appears to play a predominant role in the development of bone metastases, by virtue of its involvement in the development of bone tissue (P. Soriano et al. Cell 1991. 64 :693-702 ; Nakagawa et al, Int. J. Cancer 2000. 88 :384-391).<br>
Tie2<br>
Tie-2 (TEK) is a member of a family of tyrosine kinase receptors, specific for endothelial cells. Tie2 is the first receptor possessing tyrosine kinase activity for which both the agonist (angiopoietin 1 or Ang1) which stimulates autophosphorylation of the receptor and cell signaling [S. Davis et al (1996) Cell 87, 1161-1169] and the antagonist (angiopoietin 2 or Ang2) [P.C. Maisonpierre et al. (1997) Science 277, 55-60] are known. Angiopoietin 1 can act synergistically with VEGF in the final stages of neoangiogenesis [AsaharaT. Circ. Res.(1998) 233-240]. Knockout experiments and transgenic manipulations of the expression of Tie2 or of Ang1 result in animals which exhibit vascularization defects [D.J. Dumont et al (1994) Genes Dev. 8, 1897-1909 and C. Suri (1996) Cell 87] 1171-1180lThe binding of Ang1 to its receptor results in the autophosphorylation of the kinase domain of Tie2 which is essential for neovascularization and also for the recruitment and interaction of the vessels with pericytes and smooth muscle cells; these phenomena contribute torthe maturation and stability of the, newly,, formed vessels [P.C. Maisonpierre et al (1997) Science 277, 55-60]. Lin et al (1997) J. Clin. Invest 100, 8; 2072-2078 and P. Lin (1998) PNAS 95, 8829-8834, have" shown an inhibition of tumor growth and vascularization and also a decrease in lung metastases during adenoviral infections or during injections of the extracellular domain of Tie-2 (Tek) in breast tumor and melanoma xenograft models.<br>
Tie2 inhibitors can be used in situations where neovascularization takes place inappropriately (i.e. in diabetic retinopathy, chronic inflammation, psoriasis,<br><br>
Kaposi's sarcoma, chronic neovascularization due to macular degeneration, rheumatoid arthritis, infantile hemangioma and cancers).<br>
IGF1R<br>
The type 1 receptor for insulin-like growth factor (IGF-I-R) is a transmembrane receptor with tyrosine kinase activity which binds initially to IGFI but also to IGFII and to insulin with lower affinity. The binding of IGF1 to its receptor leads to oligomerization of the receptor, activation of the tyrosine kinase, intermolecular autophosphorylation and phosphorylation of cell substrates (main substrates : IRS1 and She). The receptor activated by its ligand induces mitogenic activity in normal cells. However, IGF-I-R plays an important role in "abnormal" growth.<br>
Several clinical reports underline the important role of the IGF-I pathway in the development of human cancers:<br>
-	IGF-I-R is often found overexpressed in many tumor types (breast, colon, lung, sarcoma, etc.) and its presence is often associated with a more aggressive phenotype.<br>
-	High concentrations of circulating IGF1 correlate strongly with a risk of prostate cancer, lung cancer and breast cancer.<br>
In addition, it has been widely documented that IGF-I-R is necessary for establishing and maintaining the transformed phenotype in vitro as in vivo [R Baserga, Exp. Cell. Res., 1999, 253, pages 1-6]. The kinase activity of IGF-i-R is essential to the transforming activity of several oncogenes: EGFR, PDGFR, SV40 virus large T antigen, activated Ras, Raf, and v-Src. The expression of IGF-I-R in normal fibroblasts induces a neoplastic phenotype, which can then lead to the formation of a tumor in vivo. The expression of IGF-I-R plays an important role in substrate-independent growth. IGF-I-R has also been shown to be a protector in apoptosis induced by chemotherapy and radiation, and apoptosis induced by cytokines. In addition, the inhibition of endogenous IGF-I-R by a dominant negative, the formation of a triple helix or the expression of an antisense causes suppression of the transforming activity in vitro and a decrease in tumor growth in animal models.<br><br>
CDK2 and CDK4<br>
Cyclirvdependent kinases (CDKs) constitute a family of protein kinases which are involved mainly in the control of progression between the various phases of the cell cycle. During the G1 phase, CDK4 associates with cyclin D and phosphorylates the Rb protein, which results in its inactivation, and induction of dissociation of the transcription factors E2F and DP1. These transcription factors then enter the nucleus, where they control the genie expression required for the G1/S transition and progression into S phase. The CDK2-cyclin E complex is also responsible for the G1/S transition and, in addition, regulates centrosome duplication. Deregulation of the kinase activity of CDKs in many tumors has stimulated an intensive search for inhibitors, for antiproliferative purposes (see, for example, TRENDS in Pharmacological Sciences Vol.23 No.9 September 2002 ).<br>

The compounds of formula (IK) for which X represents S020, R1 represents a 1H-benzimidazol-2-yl group, and Z and R have the same meaning as in formula (I) can be prepared from corresponding compounds of formula (II I) according to the following scheme:<br><br><br>
The compound (II I) in which R = H can be prepared according to the method described in EP-A-708105, pp.13-15. Similarly, derivatives of formula (II I) for which R has the same meaning as in formula (I) can be prepared from suitable precursors. Step a can be carried out using 1,2-diaminobenzene in the presence of an activating agent (N,N'-diisopropyIcarbodiimide for example), in an inert solvent (dimethylformamide for example), at a temperature of between 0°C and the boiling point of the medium, or according to the well known coupling methods of peptide chemistry (M. BODANSZKY et al., Principles of Peptide Synthesis, Spinger-Verleg, New York, NY, 1984, 9-58) or the well known methods for the formation of an amide. The deprotection step b can be carried out, for example, by means of hydrogen or of a hydrogen donor, such as cyclohexene, in the presence of a catalyst (palladium-on-charcoal for example), in an inert solvent such as an alcohol (methanol for example), at a temperature of between 25°C and the boiling point of the medium, or according to the well known methods of deprotection of the alcohol function (T. W. GREENE et al. in Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, third edition, 1999, Wiley-Interscience). The last step (step c) can be carried out as described previously.<br>
It is understood by those skilled in the art that, generally and for ease of synthesis, the R1 group may be introduced first and then the series of Z-X substituents may be introduced onto the indazole or, conversely, the sequence of Z=X substituents may be introduced first and then the R1 group may be introduced onto the indazole according to the following scheme, with B and R'1 as suitable precursors of the series of Z-X substituents and of the R1 group respectively:<br><br><br>
It is understood by those skilled in the art that, for the implementation of the methods according to the invention described above, it may be necessary to introduce protective groups for the amine, carboxyl and alcohol functions in order to avoid side reactions. These groups are those which can be removed without affecting the remainder of the molecule. As examples of protective groups for the amine function, mention may be made of terf-butyl carbamate, which can be regenerated by means of iodotrimethylsilane or in an acidic medium (trifluoroacetic acid, or hydrochloric acid in a solvent such as dioxane for example), benzyl carbamate, which can be regenerated in the presence of hydrogen or in the presence of a mixture of a thiol (benzenethiol for example) and of a Lewis acid (boron trifluoride etherate for example), acetyl which can be regenerated in an acidic medium (hydrochloric acid for example), benzoyl, which can be regenerated in an acidic medium (hydrochloric acid for example), or 2-trimethylsilanylethoxymethyl, which can be regenerated in the presence of tetrabutylammonium fluoride or in an acidic medium for example (hydrochloric acid for example). Protective groups for the carboxyl function which may be mentioned are the esters (methoxymethyl ester, benzyl ester, methyl ester for example) which can be regenerated by the methods described by T.W. GREENE et al. in Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, third edition, 1999, Wiley-lnterscience. Protective groups for the alcohol function which may be mentioned are the esters (benzoyl ester for example) which can be regenerated in an acidic medium or by catalytic hydrogenation, or else the ethers, such as methyl ether, for example, which can be regenerated in the presence of boron tribromide. Other protective groups<br><br>
which can be used are described by T.W. GREENE et al. in Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, third edition, 1999, Wiley-lnterscience.<br>

The boronic acids described above (295 umol) are distributed in 4 filtering reactors of a Bohdan 48-weil miniblock, and then a solution of 0.1 g of tert-butyl 3-iodo-5-(N-tert-butoxycarbonyl-2-methylsulfonylbenzenesulfonylamino)-indazole-1-carboxylate in 2 ml of dimethylformamide, 0.32 ml of a saturated aqueous      sodium      hydrogencarbonate      solution      and      4.3 mg     of tetrakis(tn'phenylphosphine)palladium(0)   are    successively   added.    After closing of the reactors, the reaction mixtures thus obtained are stirred at a temperature  in  the  region  of 105°C for 20  hours.  After cooling to  a temperature in the region of 20°C, the reaction mixtures are filtered and then diluted with 2 ml of ethyl acetate and 2 ml of water each, stirred and allowed to settle out. The organic phases are separated (Myriad Allex automated device) and, for each sample thus obtained, a 15 pi sample is analyzed by LC/MS, then they are concentrated to dryness under reduced pressure (Genevac HT8 centrifugal evaporator) at a temperature in the region of 40°C. The residues are dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide so as to have concentrations of 0.1 mg/yl and the corresponding solutions are purified by LCMS (conditions B). After purification by LC/MS, the fractions containing the expected products are   concentrated  to   dryness   under  reduced   pressure   (Genevac HT8 centrifugal evaporator) at a temperature in the region of 40°C, and the residues  are  weighed  (Mettler Toledo Automated Workstation  LA200), dissolved at a concentration of 10 mM in dimethyl sulfoxide (Zinsser) and then analyzed by LC/MS. The fractions containing the expected products having satisfactory purity are pooled and a 10 pi sample diluted in 10 pi of dimethyl sulfoxide is analyzed by LC/MS. The following compounds were isolated and characterized by their retention time (Tr) and molecular peak by mass spectrometry.<br><br><br>

Setting up of the reactions :<br>
Using an automated laboratory device, 336 pL of pyridine are distributed in 71 filtering reactors (ACT496, Advanced Chem Tech) each containing 50 pmol of 5-amino-3-phenyl-1H-indazole in THF (1.5 ml). The reaction mixtures thus obtained are stirred and cooled to 0°C and then 301 pL of each of the solutions of sulfonyl derivatives described above are added thereto.<br>
While maintaining the stirring for 16 hours, the temperature is allowed to come back up to 20°C, and then the reaction media are filtered. The filtrates are evaporated to dryness, and then the evaporation residues are each taken up with 500 pi of DMSO then stirred for 1 hour. For each sample in solution in DMSO thus obtained, a 15 pL sample is analyzed by LC/MS and then the residual solutions are purified by LCMS (conditions A). After purification by LC/MS, the fractions containing the desired compounds are (optionally pooled) evaporated to dryness (Savant AES 2000 or Genevac HT8 centrifugal evaporator), weighed (Mettler Toledo Automated Workstation LA200), and diluted to 10 mM in DMSO (Zinsser Winlissy, Zinsser Analytical).

A solution of terf-butyl 3-iodo-5-(N-fert-butoxycarbonyl«2-methylsulfonyl-benzenesulfony!amino)indazole-1-carboxylate in dimethylformamide is prepared so as to obtain a concentration of 99 mM.<br>
The following 65 boronic acids (Table 3) are weighed and diluted in dimethylformamide so as to obtain a solution with a concentration of 1.47 mM.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
Setting up of the reactions :<br>
65 sintered glass reactors are arranged on two Minibiock reaction blocks (Mettier-Toledo, Viroflay, France), and 1,75 ml of the solution of ferf-butyl 3-iodo-5-(N-ferf-butoxycarbonyl-2-methylsulfonylbenzenesuifonylamino)-indazole-1-carboxylate prepared above are distributed into each one of the reactors  using  a Zinsser automated  diluting  device  (Zinsser Analytical, Frankfurt, Germany). 200 pi of each solution of boronic acid described above (Table  3)  are  then  added,  followed   by  320 pi  of a  saturated   sodium hydrogencarbonate solution. A suspension of tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)-palladium(O) in dimethylformamide is then distributed (50 pi per well), and the reactors are then closed and heated to a temperature in the region of 105°C using a suitable heating jacket (Mettier-Toledo, Viroflay, France). After one night at this temperature,  the  reaction  mixtures are filtered,  under hot conditions,  in  suitable collecting  racks (Mettier-Toledo,  Viroflay,  France) equipped with 75x100 mm hemolysis tubes, and then, after returning to ambient temperature, each reaction medium is diluted with 2 ml of ethyl acetate and transferred into a 13x100 mm tube for liquid-liquid extraction (Zinsser Winlissy, Zinsser Analytical,  Frankfurt, Germany). The following extraction sequence is applied twice to each reaction medium: addition of 2 ml of distilled water, mixing, settling out, removal of the aqueous phase, which is returned to its tube of origin. At the end of these operations, the organic  extracts  are  transferred   (Zinsser  Winlissy,   Zinsser  Analytical, Frankfurt,  Germany) into  pre-tared tubes (AWS LA200,  Mettier-Toledo, Viroflay, France); before evaporation, 10 pi of each organic extract are transferred (Zinsser Winlissy, Zinsser Analytical, Frankfurt, Germany) into a microtitration   plate  and  diluted  with  40   \i\  of dimethyl  sulfoxide,  thus constituting 65 crude samples used for the LC/MS analysis. The tared tubes containing the organic extracts are finally evaporated to dryness (Genevac HT8 or Savant centrifugal evaporator), thus providing the crude samples. Before purification, the samples are prepared in the following way: each sample is solubilized in 1 ml of dimethyl sulfoxide, and filtered in a filtering plate. The filtrates are then distributed in two wells each of 500 pi and subjected to purification by LC/MS (conditions B).<br><br>
After purification by LC/MS, the fractions containing the desired compounds are (optionally pooled) evaporated to dryness (Savant AES 2000 or Genevac HT8 centrifugal evaporator), weighed (Mettler Toledo Automated Workstation LA200), and diluted to 10 mM in dimethyl sulfoxide (Zinsser Winlissy, Zinsser Analytical). Each solution obtained is analyzed by LC/MS. The following compounds were isolated and characterized by their retention time and molecular peak in mass spectrometry.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
Analysis by LC/MS :<br>
The LC/MS analyses were carried out on a Micromass device model LCT connected to an HP 1100 device. The abundance of the products was measured using an HP G1315A diode array detector over a wave range of 200-600 nm and a Sedex 65 light scattering detector. The acquisition of the mass spectra was carried out over a range of 180 to 800. The data were analyzed using the Micromass MassLynx software. The separation was carried out on a Hypersil BDS C18, 3 pm (50 x 4.6 mm), column, eluting with a linear gradient of 5 to 90% of acetonitrile containing 0.05% (v/v) of trifluoroa'cetic acid (TFA) in water containing 0.05%'(v/v) TFA over 3.5 min at a flow rate of 1 mL/mn. The total time of analysis, including the column reequilibration period, is 7 min.<br>
Purification by LC/MS ; conditions A :<br>
The products were purified by LC/MS using a Waters FractionsLynx system composed of a Waters gradient pump model 600, a Waters regeneration pump model 515, a Waters Reagent Manager dilution pump, a Waters autoinjecter model 2700, two Rheodyne valves model LabPro, a Waters<br><br>
diode array detector model 996, a Waters mass spectrometer model ZMD and a Gilson fraction collector model 204. The system was controlled by Waters FractionLynx software. The separation was carried out alternately on two Waters Symmetry columns (C18, 5 pM, 19 x 50 mm, catalogue reference 186000210), one column undergoing regeneration with a 95/5 (v/v) water/acetonitrile mixture containing 0.07% (v/v) of trifluoroacetic acid, while the other column was in the process of separation. The columns were eluted using a linear gradient of 5 to 95% of acetonitrile containing 0.07% (v/v) of trifluoroacetic acid in water containing 0.07% (v/v) of trifluoroacetic acid, at a flow rate of 10 mL/mn. On leaving the separating column, one thousandth of the effluent is separated with LC Packing Accurate, diluted with methyl alcohol at a flow rate of 0.5 mL/mn and sent to the detectors, in a proportion of 75% to the diode array detector and the remaining 25% to the mass spectrometer. The remainder of the effluent (999/1000) is sent to the fraction collector, where the flow is eliminated as long as the mass of the expected product is not detected by the FractionLynx software. The FractionLynx software is provided with the molecular formulae of the expected products, and triggers collection of the product when the mass signal detected corresponds to the ion [M+H]+ and/or to [M+Na]+. In certain cases, depending on the results of analytical LC/MS, when an intense ion corresponding to [M+2H]++ has been detected, the FractionLynx software is also provided with the value corresponding to half the calculated molecular mass (MW/2). Under these conditions, collection is also triggered when the mass signal for the ion [M+2H]++ and/or [M+Na+H]++ is detected. The products were collected in tared glass tubes. After collection, the solvents were evaporated off, in a Savant AES 2000 or Genevac HT8 centrifugal evaporator, and the product masses were determined by weighing the tubes after evaporation of the solvents.<br>
Purification by LC/MS ; conditions B :<br>
The products were purified by preparative chromatography coupled to detection by mass spectrometry on the Waters system controlled by the Mass Lynx software for the detection (positive electrospray mode), along with Fraction Lynx for the collection. The purification was carried out on an X Terra® column (Ci8 grafted phase, 5 pm) 100 mm in length and 30 mm in diameter. The flow rate of the eluent was fixed at 20 ml/min. Either a<br><br>
water/acetonitrile/trifluoroacetic acid at 0.05% (v/v) gradient is used, the composition of which varies in a linear fashion overtime in the following way :<br>
0 min	water: 50% (v/v)	acetonitrile : 50% (v/v)<br>
6 min	water: 50% (v/v)	acetonitrile : 50% (v/v)<br>
12 min	water: 5% (v/v)	acetonitrile : 95% (v/v)<br>
15 min	water: 5% (v/v)	acetonitrile : 95% (v/v)<br>
or an isocratic system is used, composed of: 60% (v/v) water/acetonitrile : 40% (v/v) / trifluoroacetic acid at 0.05% (v/v).<br>
After collection, the solvents were evaporated off in a Genevac HT8 centrifugal evaporator and the product masses were determined by weighing the tubes after evaporation of the solvents.<br>

Determination of the activity of the compounds - experimental protocols<br>
1.        FAK<br>
The inhibitory activity of the compounds on FAK is determined by measuring the inhibition of the autophosphoryiation of the enzyme using a time resolved fluorescence (HTRF) assay.<br><br>
The complete cDNA of human FAK, the N-terminal end of which was labeled with histidine, was cloned into a baculovirus expression vector pFastBac HTc. The protein was expressed and purified to approximately 70% homogeneity.<br>
The kinase activity is determined by incubating the enzyme (6.6 pg/ml) with<br>
various concentrations of test compound in a 50 mM Hepes buffer, pH = 7.2, containing 10 mM MgCl2, 100 pM Na3V04  and 15 uM d'ATP for 1 hour at<br>
37°C. The enzyme reaction is stopped by adding Hepes buffer, pH = 7.0, containing 0.4 mM KF, 133 mM EDTA and 0.1% BSA, and the labeling is carried out, over 1 to 2 hours at ambient temperature, by adding to this buffer an anti-Histidine antibody labeled with XL665 and a monoclonal antibody phosphospecific for tyrosine, conjugated to europium cryptate (Eu-K). The characteristics of the two fluorophores are available in G. Mathis et alM Anticancer Research, 1997, 17, pages 3011-3014. The transfer of energy from the excited europium cryptate to the XL665 acceptor is proportional to the degree of autophosphorylation of FAK. The long-lived signal specific for XL-665 is measured in a Packard Discovery plate counter. All the assays are carried out in duplicate and the mean of the two assays is calculated. The inhibition of the FAK autophosphorylation activity with compounds of the invention is expressed as percentage inhibition compared to a control whose activity is measured in the absence of test compound. The [signal at 665 nm/signal at 620 nm] ratio is used for the calculation of the % inhibition.<br>

The incubation buffer is removed and the wells are washed three times with 300 pi of PBS. The radioactivity is measured in each well using Top Count NXT radioactivity counter (Packard).<br>
The background noise is determined by measuring the radioactivity in four different wells containing the radioactive ATP and the substrate alone.<br>
A control for total activity is measured in four different wells containing all the reagents (y33P-[ATP], KDR and PLCy substrate) but in the absence of compound.<br>

The C-terminal fragment (Q1687-H2101) of a NuMA (Nuclear protein that associates with the Mitotic Apparatus) expressed in £. coli, and the N-terminal end of which was labeled with histidine, was purified by nickel chelate chromatography and used as substrate in the Aurora2 kinase assay. In order to determine the kinase activity, the NuMA substrate is equilibrated by chromatography on a Pharmacia PD10 column, in a buffer (50 mM Tris-HCI, pH7.5, 50 mM NaCI, 10 mM MgCI2) to which 10% (v/v) of glycerol and 0.05% (w/v) of NP40 have been added.<br>
The kinase acivitity of Aurora2 is measured by scintillation with nickel chelate (New England Nuclear, model SMP107). Each well contains 100 pi of the following solution : 0.02 pM of Aurora2 ; 0.5 pM of NuMA substrate; 1 pM of ATP to which 0.5 pCi of ATP-[33P] has been added. The solutions are<br><br>
incubated for 30 minutes at 37°C. The assay buffer is then removed and the wells are rinsed twice with 300 pi of kinase buffer. The radioactivity is measured in each well using a Packard Model Top Count NXT device.<br>
The background noise is deduced from, the measurement of radioactivity by measuring, in duplicate, in wells containing the radioactive ATP alone -containing buffered kinase treated in the same way as the other samples.<br>

After incubation for 30 minutes at 25°C, the wells are washed with a washing buffer (Wallac) and then the antiphosphotyrosine antibody (PY20-Europium [Perkin Elmer]) is added in a volume of 75 pi. The plate is incubated for 30 minutes at 25°C and then an " Enhancer" solution (Wallac) is added before reading the fluorescence using a fluorimeter (Perkin Elmer). The background noise is evaluated in triplicate in wells containing the substrate and the antibody in the absence of enzyme.

The kinase activity of Tie2 is measured in a 20mM MOPS buffer, pH 7.2, containing 10 mM MgCI2, 10 mM MnCI2, 1 mM DTT and 10 mM of glycerophosphate. A reaction mixture composed of 70 pi of kinase buffer containing 100 ng of GST-Tie2 enzyme per well is placed in a FlashPlate 96-weil plate kept on ice. 10 pi of the test molecule diluted in DMSO at a maximum concentration of 10% are then added. For a given concentration, each measurement is carried out in quadruplicate. The reaction is initiated by adding 20 pi of solution containing 2 pg of GST-PLC, 2 pM of cold ATP and 1 pCi of 33P[ATP]. After incubation for 1 hour at 37°C, the reaction is stopped by adding 1 volume (100 pi) of 200 mM EDTA. After removing the incubation buffer, the wells are washed three times with 300 pi of PBS.
