SYSTEMS AND METHODS FOR DISTRIBUTED SERIES COMPENSATION OF<br>
POWER LINES USING PASSIVE DEVICES<br>
CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION<br>
[0001]	This application claims priority to copending U.S. provisional application entitled,<br>
"Systems and Methods for Determining Power System Transmission Line Information",<br>
having serial number 60/648,466 filed January 31,2005, which is entirely incorporated<br>
herein by reference.<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0002]	The present disclosure is generally related to controlling power flow in a .<br>
transmission grid and, more particularly, to inserting distributed series impedance into<br>
power transmission lines to reduce the current flow in the targeted lines.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0003]	Of the challenges facing utilities, a major issue is the elimination of transmission<br>
constraints and bottlenecks. A significant issue in terms of grid utilization is active<br>
power flow control. Electric utility customers purchase real power, megawatts and MW-<br>
Hrs, as opposed to voltage or reactive power. Thus, control of how and where real power<br>
flows on the network is of critical importance. Congested networks limit system<br>
reliability and constrain the ability of low cost generators to provide interested customers<br>
with low-cost power. The situation is considerably aggravated when one sees that<br>
neighboring power lines are operating below capacity, but cannot be utilized, while<br>
uncontrolled 'loop-flows' result in overloads on existing lines. Active power flow<br>
control requires cost-effective 'series VAR' solutions that can alter the impedance of the<br>
power lines or change the angle of the voltage applied across the line, thus controlling<br>
power flow. Series reactive compensation has rarely been used other than on long<br>
transmission lines, mainly because of high costs and complexity of achieving voltage<br>
isolation and issues related to fault management.<br>
1<br><br>
WO 2006/083739	PCT/US2006/003048<br>
[0004]	There is general consensus that future power grids will need to be smart and<br>
aware, fault tolerant and self-healing, dynamically and statically controllable, and asset<br>
and energy efficient. The accepted and technically proven approach for realizing a smart<br>
grid, in particular achieving control of active power flow on the grid, has been through<br>
the use of Flexible AC Transmission Systems, or FACTS. Typical FACTS devices can<br>
operate at up to 345 kV and can be rated as high as 200 MVA. Even though FACTS<br>
technology is technically proven, it has not seen widespread commercial acceptance due<br>
to a number of reasons: 1) High system power ratings require the use of custom high<br>
power GTO or GCT devices with significant engineering effort - raises first cost; 2)<br>
High fault currents (60,000 Amps) and basic insulation requirements (lOOOkV) stress the<br>
power electronic system, especially for series systems that are required for power flow<br>
control; 3) Utilities require higher reliability levels than what they have so far<br>
experienced with FACTS devices; 4) Required skilled work force in the field to<br>
maintain and operate the system is not within a utility's core competency normally; 5)<br>
High total cost of ownership, e.g., the Marcy convertible static compensator (CSC) cost<br>
$54 million.<br>
[0005]	The use of clamp-on transformers to realize 'floating' power couplers is well<br>
known. The technique has been proposed for coupling power from an insulated cable for<br>
underwater power transfer, and for contactless power transfer to mining equipment. The<br>
use of power line instrumentation that is floating on the power lines, and draws power<br>
from the line itself is also well known and has long been in commercial use. The use of<br>
floating couplers to realize power line communication, including broadband over power<br>
line (BPL) is also well known. The use of series coupled transformers to inject<br>
quadrature voltage into the line, as in a SSSC, UPFC or active filter is also well known.<br>
[0006]	Distributed series passive impedance use has been proposed by Hydro-Quebec,<br>
inserting switchable series capacitors on long transmission lines to change line<br>
impedance. The switches are generally controlled from a central controller. However,<br>
the line is specially built for desired impedance at significant cost and reduced flexibility.<br>
The desired impedance cannot be easily be attached to an existing line, and cannot be<br>
2<br><br>
WO 2006/083739	PCT/US2006/003048<br>
redeployed at a later date. Further, the capacitances can only decrease line impedance,<br>
and are primarily used to reduce the impedance of long-haul transmission lines.<br>
[0007]	The use of distributed series 'active' impedance modules has been proposed in<br>
U.S. patent application entitled "Distributed Floating Series Active Impedances For<br>
Power Transmission Systems," having serial no. 10/678,966 and filed on October 3,<br>
2003, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. The application proposes<br>
the use of power electronics inverters distributed along the line, to be used collectively to<br>
inject a quadrature voltage into the line to control current flow. The proposed technique<br>
requires a high bandwidth communications infrastructure that is used to command the<br>
impedance required from individual modules. The command is to be generated by a<br>
network level controller that has visibility to the current in all power lines, and can<br>
compute the optimal value for individual line impedances. This command is then<br>
communicated to individual modules for execution.<br>
[0008]	The complexity of the above-described mode of operation adds significant cost<br>
and complexity to the power transmission system. The cost of the power converters<br>
themselves, especially when designed to operate under the harsh environmental<br>
conditions encountered on a power transmission line, is likely to be a limiting factor.<br>
Further, the operation of power electronics converters for long periods of time (target 30<br>
years) when suspended on a power transmission line and subject to harsh environmental<br>
conditions, will create reliability and availability problems for utilities deploying such<br>
technology. These issues point to the need for an alternative approach that has lower<br>
cost, is simpler, and is not predicated on the availability of a high bandwidth<br>
communications infrastructure.<br>
[0009]	There exists then a need for a distributed approach realizing passive devices, in<br>
particular series passive devices for distributed series impedance.<br><br>
WO 2006/083739	PCT/US2006/003048<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
[0025]	FIG. 1 illustrates an embodiment of a distributed series reactor (DSR), denoted by<br>
reference numeral 100, for line overload control by insertion of a distributed series<br>
impedance into a conductor 108 of an electric power system 102. The electric power<br>
system 102 has an electric power source 104 and a load 106 connected by at least one,<br>
and usually multiple, conductors 108. Of course, the electric power system 102 may have<br>
multiple power sources 104 and multiple loads 106. The DSR 100 is attached to a<br>
transmission line conductor 108 preferably, but not necessarily, near to an insulator 110.<br>
As discussed further below, the DSR 100 modules are formed to attach to the conductor<br>
108 without requiring a break or any other physical modification to the power line.<br>
Further, the DSR 100 operates without the necessity of information regarding currents<br>
flowing in the rest of the network, without a central controller, and without a<br>
communication infrastructure that is normally required for proper system operation.<br>
[0026]	The first power transmission line in an interconnected network that reaches a<br>
thermal limit constrains the power transfer capacity of the entire network, even though all<br>
other lines, at that time, may be operating significantly below their thermal limit. Under<br>
such conditions, if the impedance could be increased for the line approaching thermal<br>
limit, current would flow into other lines that have not yet reached their thermal limit.<br>
This would essentially increase the amount of current flowing in the network without<br>
causing an overload on any one line. Thus, line impedance can be controlled based on<br>
local parameters alone, i.e. the current in the power transmission line, and does not<br>
require information from any other lines in the network.<br>
[0027]	Implementation of such overload control requires only an increase in the<br>
impedance of the line beyond its nominal value. As line current approaches its thermal<br>
limit value, the impedance of the line increases, causing a redistribution of the current in<br>
the network such that under-loaded lines will be forced to carry additional levels of<br>
current than they would normally carry.<br>
[0028]	Further, to achieve distributed series impedance it is not necessary to vary the<br>
impedance of each module over the entire range. Rather, each module can switch<br>
between a limited number of distinct values, and the switching of all the modules can be<br>
6<br><br>
WO 2006/083739	PCT/US2006/003048<br>
coordinated using apriori set points so as to realize line impedance variation over a<br>
desired range.<br>
[0029]	The DSR 100 allows a passive, switchable distributed inductance to be gradually<br>
inserted into a conductor 108, thus effectively increasing the line impedance and causing<br>
current to direct into other lines that have additional capacity. A distributed series<br>
impedance device such as the DSR 100 may be clamped around the conductor 108 using<br>
a single turn transformer (STT). As discussed further below, the STT has an air-gap<br>
designed to insert a desired magnetizing inductance into the conductor 108. The power<br>
and control circuits are simplified, thus reducing weight, cost and reliability of the DSR<br>
100. The use of mainly passive components results in improved design for harsh<br>
environments, extreme temperatures and electrical overloads under fault conditions. The<br>
use of redundant DSR 100 modules improves system reliability. Monitoring line<br>
inductance as a function of line current also makes it possible to identify the location of a<br>
failed DSR 100 module.<br>
[0030]	FIG. 2 illustrates an example of a power system having two transmission lines.<br>
The first line 116 is 20 miles long and has an impedance of3.4 + jl6 ohms and a current<br>
of 170 Amperes. The second line 118 is 30 miles long and has impedance of 5.1 + j24<br>
ohms and a current of 513.5 Amperes. The power source 112 has a voltage of 138XXX0"<br>
kV. The load 114 is at a voltage of 138XXX9.O70 kV. Line 116 reaches thermal limit before<br>
line 118 does. At that point no more power can be transferred without overloading line<br>
116, even though line 118 has additional unutilized capacity.<br>
[0031]	For controlling power flow on transmission lines, the series elements have the<br>
7<br>
highest potential and impact. The real and reactive power flow, P and Q, along the<br>
transmission line connecting two voltage buses is governed by the two voltage<br>
magnitudes V1 and V2 and the voltage phase angle difference d = d1 - d2 ■<br><br><br>
WO 2006/083739	PCT/US2006/003048<br>
where X1 is the impedance of the line, assumed to be purely inductive.<br>
[0032]	Control of real power flow on the line thus involves changing the angle 5, or the<br>
line impedance X1. Of course, reactive power flow is also affected by the changing line<br>
impedance. A phase shifting transformer can. be used to control the angle d. This is an<br>
expensive solution and does not allow dynamic control capability. Alternatively, a series<br>
compensator can be used to increase or decrease the effective reactive impedance X1 of<br>
the line, thus allowing control of real power flow between the two buses. The impedance<br>
change can be effected by series injection of a passive capacitive or inductive element<br>
into the line. Alternatively, a static inverter can be used to realize a controllable active<br>
loss-less element such as a negative or positive inductor or a synchronous fundamental<br>
voltage that is orthogonal to the line current.<br>
[0033]	Referring again to FIG. 2, transmission and sub-transmission systems tend to be<br>
increasingly meshed and interconnected. The ability to switch out faulted lines without<br>
impacting service has a dramatic impact on system reliability. However, in such<br>
interconnected systems, current flow is determined by line impedances, and the system<br>
operator has very limited ability to control where the currents flow in the network. In<br>
such systems, the first line to reach thermal capacity limits the capacity of the entire<br>
network, even as other lines remain considerably under-utilized. For example, if series<br>
reactive compensation were applied to the two line system 100 in FIG. 2, additional<br>
current could flow in line 118 and an additional 52 MW of power could be transferred<br>
between the two buses by changing the line reactances by 20 percent, as is shown in<br>
TABLE A.<br><br>
WO 2006/083739	PCT/US2006/003048<br><br>
[0034]	Series FACTS devices can control power flow by varying the parameters in<br>
equation (1). Such devices typically require a break in the line and a high voltage<br>
platform, further adding to the cost and complexity. Distributed series impedance<br>
utilizing passive devices offers the promise of a cost-effective, scalable and controllable<br>
series impedance device that can be incrementally deployed, and also features high<br>
reliability and availability.<br>
[0035]	Typical transmission line impedance XL is approximately 0.79 ohms/mile. At the<br>
line thermal capacity of 770 Amperes corresponding to 184 MVA of power flow, the<br>
voltage drop across the line impedance is thus 608 volts/mile. A two percent change in<br>
line impedance would thus require injection of 12.16 volts or 0.0158 ohms/mile. This<br>
translates into an impedance value of 42 mH or 9.24 kVAR (12 volts at 770 Amperes).<br>
This is a surprisingly small impedance value to have a significant impact on the power<br>
line capacity and could be accomplished with one single 9.24 kVAR module deployed per<br>
mile of the line. Such a module could be small and light enough to be suspended from<br>
the power line, floating both electrically and mechanically on the line itself. This also<br>
raises the possibility of implementing a distributed series impedance using a large number<br>
of such modules that can be clamped around an existing power line conductor.<br>
9<br><br>
WO 2006/083739	PCT/US2006/003048<br>
[0036]	The series injection of impedance or voltage at each module can be accomplished<br>
using a single turn transformer (STT) that uses the line conductor itself as a winding of<br>
the transformer. By floating the device on the wire, all issues of voltage rating and<br>
insulation are avoided.<br>
[0037]	The redundancy provides for uninterrupted operation in the event of a unit failure,<br>
giving higher reliability and availability. The STT allows handling of high levels of fault<br>
current, typically a challenging problem for series connected devices. The target power<br>
rating of approximately 9.2 kVA allows the use of readily-available high-volume low-<br>
cost components and manufacturing technologies to realize very low unit module cost.<br>
The devices can be incrementally deployed as needed, providing an increased level of<br>
scalability. Finally, the device can be clamped onto an existing power line, simplifying<br>
the installation and commissioning process.<br>
[0038]	FIG. 3 shows an embodiment of a distributed series reactor (DSR), denoted by<br>
reference numeral 100, for line overload control via inserting a distributed series<br>
impedance into a conductor. One or more DSR 100 devices can be deployed, though<br>
preferably at least two DSR 100 devices will be deployed in interconnected or meshed<br>
power networks. The DSR 100 devices can be autonomously controlled at the individual<br>
module level, using a simple control strategy with no communications, thus dramatically<br>
increasing the capacity of the overall power grid.<br>
[0039]	The DSR 100 comprises an STT 120, a clamp-on transformer power coupler with<br>
a switch, that clamps around the transmission line or conductor 108. In a preferred<br>
implementation, the STT 120 in its clamped position has a designed air gap such that the<br>
magnetizing inductance is substantially equal to the desired insertion inductance. The<br>
STT 120 winding is shorted using a normally closed contact switch 122. It should be<br>
evident that the contact switch could be, for example, an electromechanical switch. The<br>
contact switch 122 bypasses the module when it is not energized. A small power supply<br>
128 derives power from the line current via a current transformer 126. The power supply<br>
128 provides power to the controller 130. The controller 130 monitors the line current<br>
and opens the contact switch 122 when the line current reaches a predetermined level.<br>
With the contact switch 122 open, a thyristor 124 controls insertion of the series<br>
10<br><br>
WO 2006/083739	PCT/US2006/003048<br>
reactance. With thyristor 124 closed a minimum level of reactance corresponding to the<br>
STT 120 leakage reactance is inserted into the conductor 108. With thyristor 124 open,<br>
the STT magnetizing inductance tuned to the desired value by setting the air gap, is<br>
inserted into the line. Those of skill in the art will recognize that the thyristor 124 is not<br>
critical to the design. If the thyristor 124 is omitted, then opening the contact switch 122<br>
will insert the magnetizing inductance into the conductor 108.<br>
[0040]	The closed switch 122 shorts the transformer winding, inserting virtually zero<br>
inductance into the line or conductor 108. When the switch 122 is open, the magnetizing<br>
inductance is inserted into the conductor 108, and a distributed series reactance is<br>
implemented. Multiple DSR100 modules switching at predetermined and different<br>
levels can then be used to realize the range of power line impedance control required,<br>
thus implementing a power line overload control system. The electric power system 102<br>
operates without the necessity of a communication infrastructure and realizes reduced<br>
cost and increased reliability with the DSR 100 module implementation.<br>
[0041]	At a system level, as the current in a particular line exceeds a predetermined<br>
value, increasing numbers of DSR 100 modules are switched in, gradually increasing line<br>
impedance and diverting current to under-utilized lines. As the overall control objective<br>
is to keep lines from thermal overload, the control strategy is seen to be very simple. The<br>
control algorithm for DSR 100 modular operation is defined in equation (3).<br><br>
where<br>
Lint is the injected line inductance,<br>
Lf is the final value of inductance with all the DSR modules on the line active,<br>
Io is the triggering value of current for a module,<br>
Ithermai is the thermal limit beyond which there is no injection.<br>
[0042]	Different modules on a line have predetermined switching levels (based on line<br>
current) that collectively provide a line inductance that increases as the line current<br>
increases above a defined threshold, as illustrated in FIG. 4. FIG. 4 shows a graph 400<br>
11<br><br>
WO 2006/083739	PCT/US2006/003048<br>
illustrating the increase in line inductance above Lnat 402 as the line current increases.<br>
For example, when the line current reaches a certain level, Io 406, then the first DSR 100<br>
will activate to insert a desired level of reactance into the transmission line above the<br>
initial Lnat 402. The increased reactance will cause some current to be diverted into<br>
alternative transmission lines. As the line current I, denoted by reference numeral 408,<br>
continues to increase, a next level of activation is reached, thus causing the next DSR 100<br>
to activate and insert an additional desired level of reactance into the transmission line.<br>
The increased reactance will cause additional current to be diverted into alternate<br>
transmission lines. The insertion of distributed series impedance will continue as<br>
necessary as long as the line current increases causing additional DSR 100 modules to<br>
activate. When all DSR modules on the line are activated, the inductance reaches its final<br>
value, Lf 404. The final value of Lf 404 can be set according to the thermal limit of the<br>
conductor, and thus of the current, Ithamal 410, beyond which no injection of inductance<br>
will occur.<br>
[0043]	Pre-selected lines that are likely to see overload conditions at certain times of the<br>
day or under defined contingency conditions can be modified with DSR 100 modules to<br>
automatically handle the congestion when it occurs, and to minimally impact the system<br>
under normal operating conditions. Deployment of DSR 100 modules on a power line<br>
can thus help to realize the concept of a current limiting conductor.<br>
[0044]	Control of DSR 100 modules, when implemented on multiple lines, infers that no<br>
oscillations or interactions occur. An exponentially decaying estimator, as shown in<br>
equation (4), is used within each module to minimize interactions between modules and<br>
lines.<br><br>
valid over to£ t £ to +XXX t.<br>
Lexp corresponds to actual injection demand at every sampling instant.<br>
[0045]	Having many DSR 100 modules on the transmission lines of a power grid with all<br>
DSR 100 modules set to activate at specific current levels creates a very gradual rate of<br>
change of impedance. This effectively creates what appears as a linear change in<br>
12<br><br>
WO 2006/083739	PCT/US2006/003048<br>
impedance as far as the system is concerned and does not require communication between<br>
the devices. Each DSR 100 is programmed to turn on and off at slightly different levels.<br>
It should be emphasized also that when the current drops back below the predetermined<br>
level, then the thyristor allows the added reactance to be removed from the line and the<br>
system returns to its normal state of operation. It should be emphasized that the system is<br>
self-regulating and that the line reverts back to its original condition when the thermal<br>
overload conditions are no longer present. It should be further emphasized that while<br>
communication is not necessary for the operation of the DSR 100, communications can<br>
be used to improve performance. Control is based on parameters local to the DSR 100.<br>
Multiple units are controlled in sequence to create a continuum in terms of impedance<br>
parameters.<br>
[0046]	As an example, with one hundred DSR 100 modules deployed, it is possible to<br>
change line inductance with one percent resolution. The switching of the DSR 100<br>
modules would need to incorporate noise filtering, hysteresis, and other protection<br>
mechanisms as is well known to those skilled in the art. However, it is still evident that<br>
no communication is required for the operation of the DSR 100.<br>
[0047]	The DSR 100 module may be understood as a current limiting cable. As the<br>
current in the cable approaches its thermal capacity, it increases the impedance thus<br>
forcing current to flow into other relatively unloaded parts of the network. This occurs in<br>
a predictable manner and allows system operators to better utilize the system available<br>
transmission capacity.<br>
[0048]	FIG. 5A emphasizes the STT 120 portion of a DSR 100. The STT 120 is clamped<br>
around a conductor 108 and includes two split core sections 132, a winding 134 and a<br>
normally closed contact switch 122. The split core sections 132 are the portion of the<br>
STT 120 that are clamped around the conductor 108. Additionally, a second contact<br>
switch 136 maybe used if it is desired to utilize separate windings 134 on each of the two<br>
split core sections 132. It should be noted that the contact switches could be, for<br>
example, electromechanical switches.<br>
[0049]	FIG. 5B illustrates a view from one end of the ST 120 portion of the DSR 100.<br>
The controller 130 operates the contact switch 122. The controller closes the contact<br>
13<br><br>
WO 2006/083739	PCT/US2006/003048<br>
switch 122 to short the windings 134, thus bypassing the DSR100. The controller 130<br>
opens the contact switch 122 to utilize the DSR 100. The air gap 138 is designed such<br>
that the DSR 100 will produce the desired inductance when the controller 130 places the<br>
magnetizing inductance into the conductor 350.<br>
[0050]	With contact switch 122 and thyristor 124 open, the magnetizing inductance is<br>
inserted into the cable. The air gap 138 is designed such that the correct level of<br>
inductance is inserted. This simplifies the construction of the clamp-on device thus<br>
reducing the cost. It may be desirable to use two identical halves that are coupled<br>
together to realize a complete transformer. Alternatively, all the windings can be on one<br>
segment of the core with a single core segment utilized to complete the magnetic circuit.<br>
In this instance, there would be only one contact switch 122.<br>
[0051]	It should be emphasized that DSR 100, in its preferred embodiment, is a<br>
completely passive switchable system for line overload control via inserting distributed<br>
series inductance into a conductor 108. The DSR 100 operates, in its preferred<br>
embodiment, with no communications and simplified system interface requirements.<br>
While power semiconductor could be utilized to perform the switching function, the<br>
electromechanical contactor, contact switch 122, is preferable. As noted previously, the<br>
use of mainly passive components improves design for harsh environments, extreme<br>
temperatures and electrical overloads under fault conditions. The system can be used to<br>
target lines that are in danger of overload under certain power system conditions. The<br>
system can effectively increase the line impedance and cause current to divert to lines<br>
having additional capacity. The targeted lines could be prevented from overloading, and<br>
additionally transmission loading relief calls and line trips can be avoided.<br>
[0052]	Again, it should be emphasized that no outside communications are necessary for<br>
operation of the DSR 100. It should understood by those of skill in the art, that<br>
communications could, however, be utilized to allow a system operator greater<br>
programming capability of the controller 130. The DSR 100 could be allowed to<br>
communicate with other DSR 100 modules. Further, the system operator could<br>
reprogram one or more controllers 130 via communication links (not shown).<br><br>
WO 2006/083739	PCT/US2006/003048<br>
Additionally, the controllers 130 could be reprogrammed via a short-range remote<br>
control, for example.<br>
[0053]	FIG. 6 illustrates an equivalent circuit of the transformer windings. With contact<br>
switch 122 closed, the transformer is shorted out and the leakage reactance LR is inserted<br>
in series with the conductor. This leakage reactance is on the order of 0.8 m.H, which is<br>
negligibly small in this circumstance. The controller 130 monitors line current and cable<br>
temperature to optimize thermal capacity. Based on the overall control strategy, the<br>
contact switch 122 opens, thus inserting magnetizing inductance Lm into the circuit, when<br>
an increase in line inductance is required. With a large number of units in series, a<br>
staggered switching technique would need to be used.<br>
[0054]	FIG. 7 illustrates an alternative embodiment of a DSR 700 that is purely<br>
mechanical. A core that can be moved so that the effective inductance is varied can be<br>
used to insert inductance into the conductor 108. A mechanism can be used to hold the<br>
two core halves 702 a specific distance apart under normal operating conditions, allowing<br>
a minimal inductance to be coupled to the conductor 108. As the temperature of the cable<br>
increases, the air gap 704 will be decreased, effectively increasing the inductance. A<br>
thermal mechanical band that changes shape with temperature may provide a completely<br>
passive implementation of such a device. Alternatively, a solenoid could be used.<br>
[0055]	FIG. 8 shows a flow chart 800 illustrating the operation of a DSR. A magnetizing<br>
inductance is provided in step 810 via a single turn transformer clamped around a<br>
conductor where the air gap is designed to provide the magnetizing inductance. Step 820<br>
illustrates derivation of power, used to operate the controller. The power is derived from<br>
conductor line current. The line current is monitored in step 830, such that when line<br>
current reaches a predetermined value, the contact switch is opened in step 840. Once the<br>
contact switch has been opened, then the current is monitored in step 850 until the current<br>
drops below the desired value. When the current drops below the desired value, then the<br>
contact switch will be closed as illustrated in step 860. As will be understood by those of<br>
skill in the art, the method shown in FIG. 8 could comprise more than one STT and<br>
typically would. Each of the STTs will then insert magnetizing inductance into the<br>
conductor around which it is clamped at a different predetermined value of conductor line<br><br>
WO 2006/083739	PCT/US2006/003048<br>
current to effect a gradual increase in inductance over the conductor thus reducing the<br>
overload and allowing current to increase in the alternative conductors. Again, it should<br>
be emphasized that while communications are not required for this method of utilizing<br>
the DSR, communications can be used to enhance operations.<br>
[0056]	Various implementations for inserting distributed series impedance have been<br>
simulated. The DSR model assumes a 9.24 kVAR series inductance injection at a current<br>
of 770 amperes. Based on experimental STT units built and tested, the leakage<br>
inductance is 0.8 uH, while the inserted inductance is 0.042 mH.<br>
{0001]	The DSR was further used in a four bus system 900, as shown in FIG. 9. FIG. 9<br>
depicts a four bus system 900 having two power sources, Gen 1 denoted by reference<br>
numeral 906 and Gen 2 denoted by reference numeral 907. Line 1, denoted by reference<br>
numeral 901, has a length of 40 miles and an impedance of 6.752 +jO.08372 Q. Line 2,<br>
denoted by reference numeral 902, has a length of 20 miles and an impedance of 3.376 +<br>
j0.04186 W Line 32, denoted by reference numeral 903, has a length of 30 miles and an<br>
impedance of 5.084 + j0.06279 W. Line 4, denoted by reference numeral 904, has a<br>
Length of 40 miles and an impedance of 6.752 + jO.08372 W. Line 5, denoted by reference<br>
numeral 905, has a length of 20 miLes and an impedance of 3.376 + j0.04186 W. Load 1<br>
is denoted by reference numeral 908 and load 2 is denoted by reference numeral 909.<br>
When the DSR units are bypassed, the maximum power that can be transferred through<br>
the network is limited by Line 2 and Line 5, as shown by graph 1000 in FIG. 10. With<br>
additional DSR units, the allowable ATC envelope is seen to be dramatically increased by<br>
a minimum of 37.6%.<br>
