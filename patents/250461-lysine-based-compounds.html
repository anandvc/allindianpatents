TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to lysine based compounds which present good solubility, and<br>
bioavailability. More particularly, the present invention relates to lysine based compounds<br>
having a physiologically cleavable unit, whereby upon cleavage of the unit, the compound is<br>
able to release an HIV protease inhibitor. The compounds and pharmaceutical compositions<br>
of the present invention are particularly well suited for decreasing the pill burden and <br>
increasing patient compliance.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Inhibito rs o f t he HIV v iral p rotease h ave b een developed relatively r ecently and t heir u se<br>
began only in 1996. Currently, they are considered the most effective drugs against HIV<br>
infection. Unfortunately, m ost c urrent p roteases' i nhibitors a re r elatively large h ydrophobic<br>
molecules that possess rather low bioavailability. A high pill burden is therefore required to<br>
attain the therapeutic dose in a patient. This is a deterrent, which too often results in patient<br>
non-compliance and inadequate treatment results. This situation leads to sub-optimal<br>
therapeutic drug concentration that in turns leads to the development of HIV resistant strains.<br>
Consequently, there is an urgent need to improve the solubility and bioavailability of<br>
proteases inhibitors.<br>
Examples of improved compounds have been developed in the form of prodrugs of aspartyl<br>
protease inhibitors such as described, for example, in US patent no. 6,436,989 to Hale et al,<br>
the entire content of which is incorporated herein by reference. This patent shows a novel<br>
class of molecules characterized by favourable aqueous solubility, high oral bioavailability<br>
and facile in vivo generation of the active ingredient. However, it is well known that HIV has<br>
the ability to develop resistance to the currently available drugs. Thus, there is a need for<br>
alternative HIV protease inhibitors active towards wild-type and resistant viral strains. Thus,<br>
molecules derived from current HIV protease inhibitors showing enhanced solubility and<br>
bioavailability is desirable to fight resistant viral strains.<br><br>
. A unique class of aromatic derivatives which are inhibitors of aspartyl proteases is described<br>
in US patent no. 6,632,816 to Stranix et al, the entire content of which is incorporated herein<br>
by reference. This patent includes, more particularly, iV,-synthetic amino acid substituted L-<br>
lysine derivatives possessing potent aspartyl protease inhibitory properties. However, it<br>
would be advantageous to improve these derivatives by enhancing aqueous solubility and<br>
bioavailability in order to reduce the pill burden and to favour patient's compliance. Since it<br>
is challenging to generate active protease inhibitors, specifically toward wild-type and<br>
resistant strains, the formation of derivatives of original HIV protease inhibitors such as<br>
inhibitors described in US patent no. 6,632,816 to Stranix et al, known to be active toward<br>
resistant strains represents a viable route with considerable advantages. More particularly,<br>
generation of compounds with enhanced aqueous solubility, bioavailability, time of duration<br>
and formulation properties along with other advantages is desirable in the development of an<br>
effective drug.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides novel lysine based compounds originating from a class of<br>
derivatives that are potent aspartyl protease inhibitors and pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
derivatives thereof. These compounds may readily b e cleaved in vivo to r elease the active<br>
ingredient. The active ingredient has an affinity for aspartyl proteases, in particular, HIV-1<br>
aspartyl protease (US patent no. 6,632,816). The active ingredients also present potent<br>
antiviral activity when tested on non-mutated HIV-1 viral strain (NL4.3 as the wild type<br>
virus) as well as several mutant strains. Therefore, the compounds of the present invention<br>
may be useful as a mean to increase solubility and improving bioavailability of the active<br>
ingredient (protease inhibitor). The compounds of the present invention may be used alone or<br>
in combination with other therapeutic or prophylactic agents for the treatment or prophylaxis<br>
of HIV infection. The compounds of the present invention possess good solubility and<br>
bioavailability and may be orally administered as aqueous solution.<br>
It is the main objective of this invention to provide an improved class of lysine based<br>
compounds that are able to release an aspartyl protease inhibitor, and particularly, HIV<br><br>
aspartyl protease inhibitors. Lysine based compounds of the present invention may have a<br>
cleavable unit, whereby upon cleavage of the unit the compound is able to release an HIV<br>
protease inhibitor. The present invention also provides pharmaceutical compositions<br>
comprising lysine based compounds described herein.<br>
Therefore the present invention provides in one aspect thereof, lysine based compounds<br>
which upon in vivo physiological conditions (e.g., metabolic, enteric and/or gastrointestinal<br>
conditions, etc.) allow the release of a protease inhibitor (e.g., aspartyl p rotease inhibitor).<br>
The c ompounds o f t he p resent i nvention m ay se rve asm eans for improving the s olubility<br>
and/or bioavailability of the protease inhibitors and therefore may reduce the pill burden and<br>
may favour patient's compliance.<br>
The compounds of the present invention may have, for example, a (e.g., physiologically)<br>
cleavable (e.g., hydrolysable) bond or unit which upon cleavage of the cleavable bond or unit<br>
generates a protease inhibitor (e.g., an active protease inhibitor).<br>
The p rotease inhibitor m ay a ct o n aspartyl p rotease o f HIV-1 i ncluding mutated and n on-<br>
mutated HIV-1 viral strain (e.g., NL4.3) or on protease of HTV-2 (mutated or non-mutated) or<br>
even on protease of related virus (SIV, etc.). The compounds of the present invention may be<br>
used alone or in combination with other therapeutic or prophylactic agents for the treatment<br>
or prophylaxis of, for example, an HIV infection.<br>
The compounds and the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention may release<br>
the protease inhibitor (active ingredient) in vivo and thereby may inhibit (e.g., in vivo) the<br>
activity of HIV aspartyl protease, an enzyme essential for virus maturation and infectivity.<br>
The compounds and the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention may possess<br>
higher bioavailability and may also be apt to reduce dosages needed for inhibition and<br>
consequently may improve treatment of HIV-infected patients.<br>

The compounds of the present invention may easily be prepared, using conventional<br>
techniques from readily available starting materials. The detailed descriptions of these<br>
approaches are presented, for example, in schemes 1 to 5 discussed below.<br>
Scheme 1 illustrates a generic example for the preparation of the phosphate monoester III<br>
derived from a primary alcohol (see I), a compound of HIV protease inhibitors (see example<br>
1 (step G and H) in the experimental portion of this document for a specific example of this<br>
synthesis).<br>
Note:<br>
a) R2 and R3 are as defined herein.<br>
The synthesis of phosphate monoester III may use a HTV aspartyl protease inhibitor (I, see<br>
US patent no. 6,632,816) as the starting material. The diethyl phosphotriester II was obtained<br>
in good yield upon treatment with diethyl chlorophosphate and sodium hydride in a mixture<br>
of tetrahydrofuran and triethylphosphate. Then, addition of trimethysilyl bromide in<br>
dichloromethane (DCM) gave compound III in good to excellent yields.<br><br><br>
Scheme 1A represents another generic example for the preparation of the phosphate<br>
monoester IIIA derived from a primary alcohol (see IA), a compound of HIV protease<br>
inhibitors.<br>
Note:<br>
a) n, X, Y, R2, R3 and R6 are as defined herein.<br><br>
The synthesis of phosphate monoester IIIA is performed as described for the preparation of<br>
///(scheme 1).<br>
Scheme 2 illustrates a generic example for the preparation of the phosphate monoester ///, a<br>
compound of HIV protease inhibitors, with a different approach starting from (3S)-3-<br>
isobutylamino-azepan-2-one (IV).<br>
Note:<br>
a) R2 and R3 are as defined herein.<br><br>
As shown in scheme 2, the phosphate monoester derivative III was obtained from (3S)-3-<br>
isobutylamino-azepan-2-one (IV) in a seven-step reaction sequence. Initially, (2S)-3-<br>
isobutylamino-azepan-2-one (IV) was sulfonated with 4-acetamidobenzenesulfonyl chloride<br>
in the presence of triethylamine in dichloromethane to give compound Fin excellent yields.<br>
The derivative VI was obtained quantitatively upon treatment of. V with di-tert-butyl<br>
pyrocarbonate and DMAP in acetonitrile. The reductive ring opening with sodium<br>
borohydride in ethanol lead to key intermediates VII in good yield. The diethyl<br>
phosphotriester VIII was obtained in good yield upon treatment with diethyl chlorophosphate<br>
and sodium hydride in a mixture of tetrahydrofuran and triethylphosphate. The Boc<br>
protective groups were removed upon treatment with HC1 in ethanol to give compound IX<br>
quantitatively (T.W. Greene and P. G. M. Wuts, Protective groups in Organic Synthesis, 3rd<br>
Edition, John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. 1999). Then, coupling of the free amino group present on<br>
intermediate IX with a variety of synthetic amino acid in the presence of 1-<br>
hydroxybenzotriazole (HOBt) and l-[3-(dimethylamino)propyl]-3-ethylcarbodiimide<br>
hydrochloride (EDAC) led to derivative II in good to excellent yields. Finally, addition of<br>
trimethysilyl bromide in dichloromethane (DCM) gave compound III in good to excellent<br>
yields.	<br><br><br>
Scheme 3 presents the transformation of a diphenylmethyl derivative; (1S',5S)-(1-{5-[(4-<br>
amino-benzenesulfonyl)-isobutyl-amino]-6-hydroxy-hexylcarbamoyl}-2,2-diphenyl--ethyl)-<br>
carbamic acid methyl ester (PL -100) into its fluorinated phosphate monoester sodium salt<br>
analog XI. This reaction sequence may be used to produce any other similar compounds<br><br>
(compounds) made of unsubstituted (or substituted) diphenylmethyl, 1-naphthyl, 2-naphthyl,<br>
biphenyl and 9-anthryl groups described in this invention.<br>
Thus, the treatment of PL-100 with Selectfluor™ in acetonitrile gave derivative X in 38%<br>
yield. The introduction of the phosphate monoester group was performed as described<br>
previously in scheme 1 and 2. First, the diethyl phosphotriester intermediate was obtained in<br>
good yield upon treatment with diethyl chlorophosphate and sodium hydride in a mixture of<br>
tetrahydrofuran and triethylphosphate. Secondly, addition of trimethysilyl bromide in<br>
dichloromethane (DCM) gave the phosphate monoester compound in good to excellent<br>
yields. The final product XI was easily obtained upon treatment of the phosphate monoester<br>
with a solution of sodium hydroxide with good yields.<br><br>
; Scheme 4 illustrates a generic example for the transformation of a phosphotriester II into its<br>
fluorinated analog XIII in a two-step reaction sequence. This generic example represents a<br>
second approach for the synthesis of fluorinated compounds of this invention. In this case, the<br>
fluorine atom is added to the phosphotriester II instead of the primary alcohol derivative of<br>
general formula I or, more specifically, PL-100 as shown on scheme 3. This alternate<br><br>
reaction sequence may be used to produce any other similar compounds made of<br>
unsubstituted (or substituted) diphenylmethyl, 1-naphthyl, 2-naphthyl, biphenyl and 9-anthryl<br>
groups described in this invention.<br>
Note:<br>
a) R2 and R3 are as defined herein.<br>
Briefly, treatment of derivative. II with Selectfiuor™ in acetonitrile gave derivative XII in<br>
good yields. Then, addition of trimethysilyl bromide in dichloromethane (DCM) gave the<br>
phosphate monoester compound XIII in good to excellent yields. If desired, the final product<br>
XIII may be easily transformed into the phosphate monoester sodium salt analog as described<br>
before in scheme 3.<br><br><br>
Scheme 5 illustrates the synthesis of various ester compounds XVI in accordance with the<br>
invention. The ester compounds are known to be easily cleaved in vivo by esterase enzymes<br>
and, as a result, may release the active ingredient. In this scheme R2 is set as a<br>
diphenylmethyl group. However, this reaction sequence may be used to produce any other<br>
similar compounds made of unsubstituted (or substituted) diphenylmethyl, 1-naphthyl, 2-<br>
naphthyl, biphenyl and 9-anthryl groups described in this invention.<br>
Note:<br>
a) R1A represents the "residue" of the acid molecule that is linked to the free primary alcohol<br>
group present on intermediate XV and is as defined herein. <br>
The compounds XVI are generally obtained in a three-step reaction sequence in high yields.<br>
Esterification of (1S)-{4-[(5-tert-butoxycarbonylamino-l-hydroxymethyl-pentyl)-isobutyl-<br>
sulfamoyl]-phenyl}-carbamic acid tert-butyl ester (VII) with a variety of acid in the presence<br>
of 1-hydroxybenzotriazole (HOBt) and 1-[3-(dimethylamino)propyl]-3-ethylcarbodiimide<br>
hydrochloride (EDAC) led to the desired esters XIV in excellent yields. The acetyl ester was<br>
obtained quantitatively using acetic anhydride in the presence of N,N-dimethylaminopyridine<br>
(DMAP) in dichloromethane (DCM). Cleavage of the Boc protective group was achieved<br>
quantitatively u pon t reatment w ith t rifiuoroacetic a cid ( TFA) i n D CM. A s econd c oupling<br>
with (2iS)-2-methoxycarbonylamino-3,3-diphenyl-propionic acid is performed on the primary<br>
amino group of intermediate XV with HOBt and ED AC to give the desired compounds XVI<br>
in good to excellent yields. If necessary, catalytic hydrogenation of a benzyloxycarbonyl<br>
group is performed using 10% palladium on carbon to give the final compound XVII.<br><br><br>
As it may be appreciated by the person skilled in the art, the above synthetic schemes are not<br>
intended to be a comprehensive list of all means by which the compound described and<br>
claimed in this application may be synthesized but only represent exemplification of<br>
synthesis methods among others. Further methods, will be evident to those of ordinary skill in<br>
the art.<br>
The compounds of this invention may be modified by appending appropriate functionalities<br>
to enhance selective biological properties. Such modifications are known in the art and<br><br>
include those which increase biological penetration into a given biological system (e.g.,<br>
blood, lymphatic system, central nervous system), increase oral availability, increase<br>
solubility to allow administration by injection, alter metabolism and alter rate of excretion.<br>
As discussed above, the novel compounds may release the active ingredients that are<br>
excellent ligands for aspartyl proteases, for example, HIV-1 protease. Accordingly, these<br>
compounds are, b y r eieasing t he a ctive i ngredient, c apable oft argeting and i nhibiting 1 ate<br>
stage events in the replication, i.e. the processing of the viral polyproteins by HIV encoded<br>
protease. Compounds according to this invention advantageously inhibit the ability of the<br>
HIV-1 virus to infect immortalized human T cells over a period of days, as determined by an<br>
assay measuring the amount of extracellular p24 antigen; a specific marker of viral<br>
replication (see, Meek et al., Nature, 343, pp. 90-92 (1990)).<br>
In addition to their use in the prophylaxis or treatment of HIV or HTLV infection, the<br>
compounds according to this invention may also be used as inhibitory or interruptive agents<br>
for other viruses which use aspartyl proteases, similar to HTV or HTLV aspartyl proteases, in<br>
their life cycle. Such compounds inhibit the proteolytic processing of viral polyprotein<br>
precursors by inhibiting aspartyl protease. Because aspartyl protease is essential for the<br>
production of mature virions, inhibition of that processing effectively blocks the spread of<br>
virus by mhibiting the production and reproduction of infectious virions, particularly from<br>
acutely and chronically infected cells. The compounds of this invention advantageously<br>
inhibit aspartyl proteases, thus blocking the ability of aspartyl proteases to catalyze the<br>
hydrolysis of peptide bonds.<br>
The compounds of this invention may be employed in a conventional manner for the<br>
treatment or prevention of HIV, HTLV, and other viral infections, which involve aspartyl<br>
proteases for their life (replication) cycle. Such methods of treatment, their dosage levels and<br>
requirements may be selected by those of ordinary skill in the art from available methods and<br>
techniques. For example, a compound of this invention may be combined with a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable adjuvant for administration to a virally infected patient in a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable manner and in an amount effective to lessen the severity of the<br>
viral infection.<br><br>
Alternatively, the compounds of this invention may be used in vaccines and methods for<br>
protecting individuals against viral infection over an extended period of time. The<br>
compounds may be employed in such vaccines either alone or together with other compounds<br>
of this invention in a manner consistent with the conventional utilization of protease<br>
inhibitors or protease inhibitors derivatives in vaccines. For example, a compound of this<br>
invention may be combined with pharmaceutically acceptable adjuvants, or delivery systems<br>
conventionally employed in vaccines and administered in prophylactically effective amounts<br>
to protect individuals over an extended period of time against viral infections, such as HTV<br>
infection. As such, the novel compounds of the present invention (upon cleavage of a<br>
physiologically cleavable unit) may be administered as agents for treating or preventing viral<br>
infections, including HIV infection, in a mammal.<br>
The compounds of this invention may be administered to a healthy or HIV-infected patient<br>
(before or after the onset of AIDS symptoms) either as a single agent or in combination with<br>
other antiviral agents which interfere with the replication cycle of HIV. By administering the<br>
compounds of this invention with other antiviral agents which target different events in the<br>
viral life cycle, the therapeutic effect of these compounds is potentiated. For instance, the co-<br>
administered antiviral agent may be one which targets early events in the viral life cycle, such<br>
as attachment to the cell receptor and cell entry, reverse transcription and viral DNA<br>
integration into cellular DNA. Antiviral agents targeting such early life cycle events include<br>
among others polysulfated polysaccharides, sT4 (soluble CD4) and other compounds which<br>
block binding of virus to CD4 receptors on CD4 bearing T-lymphocytes and other CD4(+)<br>
cells, or inhibit fusion of the viral envelope with the cytoplasmic membrane, and didanosine<br>
(ddl), zalcitabine (ddC), stavudine (d4T), zidovudine (AZT) and lamivudine (3TC) which<br>
inhibit reverse transcription. ,For example another protease inhibitor may be used with<br>
compounds of the present invention. Other anti-retroviral and antiviral drugs may also be co-<br>
administered with the compounds of this invention to provide therapeutic treatment for<br>
substantially reducing or eliminating viral infectivity and the symptoms associated therewith.<br>
Examples of other antiviral agents include ganciclovir, dideoxycytidine, trisodium<br>
phosphonoformate, efiornithine, ribavirin, acyclovir, alpha interferon and trimenotrexate.<br>
Additionally, other types of drags may be used to potentiate the effect of the compounds of<br>
this invention, such as viral uncoating inhibitors, inhibitors of Tat or Rev trans-activating<br>
proteins, antisense molecules or inhibitors of the viral integrase. These compounds may also<br>
be co-administered with other inhibitors of HIV aspartyl protease. Furthermore, it may be<br><br>
found useful to administer compounds of the present invention with any other drug (other<br>
anti-viral compounds, antibiotics, pain killer, etc.,).<br>
Combination therapies according to this invention exert a synergistic effect in inhibiting HIV<br>
replication because each component agent of the combination acts on a different site of HIV<br>
replication. The use of such combinations also advantageously reduces the dosage of a given<br>
conventional anti-retroviral agent that would be required for a desired therapeutic or<br>
prophylactic effect as compared to when that agent is administered as a monotherapy. These<br>
combinations may reduce or eliminate the side effects of conventional single anti-retro viral<br>
agent therapies while not interfering with the anti-retroviral activity of those agents. These<br>
combinations reduce the potential of resistance to single agent therapies, while minimizing<br>
any associated toxicity. These combinations may also increase the efficacy of the<br>
conventional agent without increasing the associated toxicity. Combination therapies<br>
encompassed by the present invention include, for example, the administration of a<br>

pharmaceutical compositions of this, invention may contain any conventional non-toxic<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, adjuvants or vehicles. The term "parenteral" as used<br>
herein includes subcutaneous, intracutaneous, intravenous, intramuscular, intra-articular,<br>
intrasynovial, intrastemal, intrathecal, intralesional and intracranial injection or infusion<br>
techniques.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions may be in the form of a sterile injectable preparation, for<br>
example, as a sterile injectable aqueous or oleaginous suspension. This suspension may be<br>
formulated according to techniques known in the art using suitable dispersing or wetting<br>
agents (such as, for example, Tween 80) and suspending agents. The sterile injectable<br>
preparation may also be a sterile injectable solution or suspension in a non-toxic parenterally<br>
acceptable diluent or solvent, for example, as a solution in 1,3-butanediol. Among the<br>
acceptable vehicles and solvents that may be employed are amino acid, water, Ringer's<br>
solution and isotonic sodium chloride solution. In addition, sterile, fixed oils are<br>
conventionally employed a s a s olvent o r s uspending m edium. F or t his p urpose, a ny b land<br>
fixed oil may be employed including synthetic mono- or diglycerides. Fatty acids, such as<br>
oleic acid and its glyceride derivatives are useful in the preparation of injectables, as are<br>
natural p harmaceutically-acceptable o ils, s uch as o live o il o r castor o il, especially i n t heir<br>
polyoxyethylated versions. These oil solutions or suspensions may also contain a long-chain<br>
alcohol diluent or dispersant, such as Ph. Helv. or a similar alcohol.<br>
The phiirmaceutical compositions of this invention may be orally administered in any orally<br>
acceptable dosage form including, but not limited to, capsules, tablets, and aqueous<br>
suspension and solutions. In the case of tablets for oral use, carriers that are commonly used<br>

typically added. For oral administration in a capsule form, useful diluents include lactose and<br>
dried cornstarch. When aqueous suspensions are administered orally, the active ingredient is<br>
combined with emulsifying and suspending agents. If desired, certain sweetening and/or<br>
flavoring and/or coloring agents may be added.<br><br>
The pharmaceutical compositions of this invention may also be administered in the form of<br>
suppositories for rectal administration. These compositions may be prepared by mixing a<br>
compound of this invention with a suitable non-irritating excipient which is solid at room<br>
temperature but liquid at the rectal temperature and therefore will melt in the rectum to<br>
release the active components. Such materials include, but are not limited to, cocoa butter,<br>
beeswax, and polyethylene glycols.<br>
Topical administration of the pharmaceutical compositions of this invention is especially<br>
useful when the desired treatment involves areas or organs readily accessible by topical<br>
application. For application topically to the skin, the pharmaceutical composition should be<br>
formulated with a suitable ointment containing the active components suspended or dissolved<br>
in a carrier. Carriers for topical administration of the compounds of this invention include,<br>
but are not limited to, mineral oil, liquid petroleum, white petroleum, propylene glycol,<br>
polyoxyethylene or polyoxypropylene compound, emulsifying wax and water. Alternatively,<br>
the pharmaceutical compositions may be formulated with a suitable lotion or cream<br>
containing the active compound suspended or dissolved in a carrier. Suitable carriers include,<br>
but are not limited to, mineral oil, sorbitan monostearate, polysorbate 6 0, cetyl esters wax<br>
cetearyl alcohol, 2-octyldodecanol, benzyl alcohol and water. The pharmaceutical<br>
compositions of this invention may also be topically applied to the lower intestinal tract by<br>
rectal suppository formulation or in a suitable neat formulation. Topically-transdermal<br>
patches are also included in this invention.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions of this invention may be administered by nasal aerosol or<br>
inhalation. Such compositions are prepared according to techniques well-known in the art of<br>
pharmaceutical formulation and may be prepared as solutions in saline employing benzyl<br>
alcohol or other suitable preservatives, absorption promoters to enhance bioavailability,<br>
fluorocarbons, and/or other solubilizing or dispersing agents known in the art.<br>
Dosage levels of between about 0.01 and about 25 mg/kg body weight per day, for example<br>
form between about 0.5 and about 25 mg/kg body weight per day of the active ingredient<br>
compound are useful in the prevention and treatment of viral infection, including HIV<br>
infection. Typically, the pharmaceutical compositions of this invention will be administered<br>
from about 1 to about 5 times per day or alternatively, as a continuous infusion. Such<br>
administration may be used as a chronic or acute therapy. The amount of active ingredient<br><br>
that may be combined with the carrier materials to produce a single dosage form will vary<br>
depending upon the patient treated and the particular mode of administration. A typical<br>
preparation will contain from about 5% to about 95% active compound (w/w). For example,<br>
such preparations may contain from about 20% to about 80% active compound.<br>
Upon improvement of a patient's condition, a maintenance dose of a compound, composition<br>
or combination of this invention may be administered if necessary. Subsequently, the dosage<br>
or frequency of administration, or both, may be reduced, as a function of the symptoms, to a<br>
level at which the improved condition is retained. When the symptoms have been alleviated<br>
to the desired level, treatment should cease. Patients may, however, require intermittent<br>
treatment on a long-term basis, upon any recurrence of disease symptoms.<br>
As the person skilled in the art will appreciate, lower or higher doses than those recited above<br>
may be desired. Specific dosage and treatment regimen for any particular patient may depend<br>
upon a variety of factors, including the activity of the specific compound employed, the age,<br>
body weight, general health status, sex, diet, time of administration, rate of excretion, drug<br>
combination, the severity and course of the infection, the patient's disposition to the infection<br>
and the judgment of the treating physician.<br><br><br><br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
EXAMPLES:<br>
Specific examples for the preparation of derivatives of general formula I<br>
The following compounds were prepared from L-lysine derivatives using the procedures<br>
summarized in schemes 1,1A, 2, 3, 4 and 5 of this invention.<br><br>
Example 1. Preparation of (l^^^-^-IS-^-amino-benzenesuIfonylHsobutyl-amino]-<br>
6-phosphonooxy-hexylcarbamoyl}-2,2-diphenyI-ethyl)-carbamic acid<br>
methyl ester (PL-461)<br>
The preparation of the title compound is based on schemes 1 and 2 of this invention.<br>
Step A.	Preparation of (35)-3-isobutylamino-azepan-2-one(/F)<br>
L-or-amino-^-caprolactam (22.0 g) was dissolved in cold dichloroethane (DCM, 200 mL).<br>
isobutyraldehyde (12.6 g) was added slowly and stirred until the heat evolved was dissipated<br>
(water forms at the surface). The cold solution was added to 46.5 g of powdered<br>
NaBH(OAc)3 in DCM (0.5 L). AcOH (70 mL) was added to the solution. The slightly turbid<br>
mixture was stirred at 20 °C for 4 h. A 500 mL solution of 2M NaOH was added slowly to<br>
the turbid mixture and the pH adjust to 11 using a concentrated NaOH solution, and then the<br>
mixture stirred for a further 20 min. After extraction, the DCM layer was dried with MgSC&gt;4,<br>
filtered and evaporated. The oil thus obtained crystallizes slowly on standing (27.8 g, 85%)<br>
and was used without further purification in the next step.<br>

To assess the extent of in vivo cleavage of the phosphate group from the putative compounds,<br>
PL-100, PL-462 (based on PL-100), PL-337 and PL-515 (based on PL-337) compounds were<br>
administered po (50 mg/kg) to male Sprague-Dawley rats and their plasma concentration<br>
measured at different time intervals post-administration.<br>
PL100 is an active ingredient (protease inhibitor) of the following formula;<br><br><br>
PL-337 is an active ingredient (protease inhibitor) of the following formula;<br><br>
The active ingredient has been shown to be efficient against an HTV-1 aspartyl protease (US<br>
patent no. 6,632,816). The active ingredients also present potent antiviral activity when tested<br>
on non-mutated HIV-1 viral strain (NL4.3 as the wild type virus) as well as several mutant<br>
strains.<br>
All test articles (PL-100, PL-462, PL-337 and PL-515) were prepared in different vehicle at<br>
the final concentration of 25 mg/mL. The vehicle composition is as follows: (1) 20% ethanol;<br>
50% propylene glycol; 0.05% w/v Tween 20 and water (Mix); (2) PBS buffer (PBS).<br>
Test articles were administered to male Sprague-Dawley rats at a single oral dose of 50<br>
mg/kg. Each article was tested in three rats. Blood samples (0.2-0.3 mL) were collected at the<br>
post-dose time of 10, 20, 40, 60,120, 180 and 360 minutes. The harvested blood was<br>
centrifuged to isolate plasma. The resulting plasma was separated and stored at -70°C.<br>
Plasma samples together with standards and quality control samples were treated to<br>
precipitate proteins, then analyzed by HPLC-MS, for the presence of PL-462, PL-100, PL-<br>
515 and PL-337.<br>
J<br><br><br>
The results demonstrate that PL-462 and PL-515 compounds may be delivered orally in<br>
aqueous solutions. None of the PL-462 and PL-515 compounds, delivered as aqueous<br>
solutions, are detected in the blood samples, which suggests rapid metabolism to PL-100 and<br>
PL-337 the parent drugs.<br>
Aqueous dosing of PL-462 and PL-515 solutions showed equivalent to slightly superior<br>
delivery of PL-100 and PL-337 compared to non-aqueous formulations of PL-100 and PL-<br>
337.<br>
Based on these results, all the phosphorylated compounds described, in the present invention<br>
will demonstrate similar pharmacokinetic properties.<br>
Partition coefficient (LogP) of selected compounds and the corresponding HIV protease<br>
inhibitors (drug) are as follow:<br><br><br>
The LogP were measured in a standard fashion by dissolving 1 mg of compound in 0.8 mL of<br>
each octanol and phosphate buffer pH 7.4 (0.04 M KHPO4). The concentration of the<br>
compounds in the phases was detected by LC-MS. This test demonstrates the solubility of the<br>
compounds at physiological pH. The LogP obtained show that the compounds are highly<br>
soluble as compare to the corresponding drugs.<br>
