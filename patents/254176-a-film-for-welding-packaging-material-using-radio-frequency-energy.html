				<td>This application claims the benefit of U.S.  Application No.   10/704,934,  filed November 11, 2003, and U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/570,550, filed May 12, 2004. FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to polymer compositions that absorb radio frequency energy. More particularly, this invention relates to films obtained from polymer compositions that can be welded using radio frequency energy. <br>
BACKGROUND DISCUSSION AND RELATED ART<br>
In packaging applications, it can sometimes be desirable to seal a film package without the use of a separate adhesive film layer on the package. Such a sealing process can be obtained by using materials that can be self-adhered, or materials that can be made to adhere to or to adhere to another material. One such process is a process by which radio frequency (RF) energy is applied to a suitable material, and after absorption of the RF energy the material can subsequently be self-adhered, or adhered to different substrates to form a seal. This process is known as RF welding, and suitable materials for such a process are known in commercial practice. Polyvinyl chloride (PVC), for example, is a material that can be susceptible to RF energy and be very suitable for RF welding. PVC, however, is not an acceptable material for widespread use in some areas of the world and alternate materials are needed to perform the function of PVC in those regions where PVC is not desirable.<br>
Selecting suitable alternate materials for use in packaging applications that use the RF welding technique is not a trivial exercise. In selecting or developing suitable alternative materials, at least three (3) criteria need to be met. First, the material must provide good physical and/or mechanical characteristics that are satisfactory for a package or a component thereof. Second, a suitable polymer film should be susceptible, that is should absorb, RF energy. Third, the polymer film should be capable of forming a bond, weld, or seal, when subjected to RF energy under the proper conditions of pressure and time.<br>
Various polymers suitable for use in packaging applications are well known. For example, polyolefins such as polyethylene and polypropylene are useful in packaging. Some polymeric materials are known to be susceptible to RF energy. However, other materials may not be suitable for use in the applications described herein due to prohibitive cost or other problems. For example, some materials can be susceptible to RF energy but are not capable of forming a seal, or weld. Some materials can require more stringent process conditions, or require that a component be increased to the detriment of other physical/mechanical properties. The susceptibility of EVA, for example, is highly dependent on the vinyl acetate<br><br><br>
content. Typically ethylene (meth)acrylic acid copolymers and their ionomers are not RF susceptible.<br>
Mixtures of ionomers and polar solvents such as glycerol can produce compositions that absorb RF energy. However, use of solvents having considerable vapor pressure at extrusion temperatures can lead to other problems, such as fogging during processing. Also, use of polar solvents can be undesirable for environmental reasons.<br>
It can be desirable to have a composition that absorbs RF energy, and can be sealed using RF welding, while yet having physical and mechanical properties suitable for use in packaging applications. <br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
In one embodiment, the present invention is a polymeric film obtained from a blend comprising an acid copolymer ionomer and a fatty acid salt. A film of the present invention is at least about 0.001 mil thick. Preferably the film is from at least about 1 mil thick to about 25 mil thick.<br>
Films of the present invention comprise acid copolymer ionomers ("ionomers"), which are copolymers well known in the polymer art. Ionomers are ionic copolymers formed by copolymerization of an a-olefin - such as ethylene, propylene, 1-butene, and other 1-unsaturated hydrocarbons - with an unsaturated carboxylic acid, such as for example acrylic<br><br><br>
acid, methacrylic acid, or maleic acid, and optionally softening comonomers. Ionomers are subsequently obtained by As used herein, the term "copolymers" can describe polymers obtained by copolymerization of at least two different monomer species. The term "terpolymer" can be used to specifically describe a copolymer that is obtained from copolymerization of three different monomer species. At least one alkali metal, transition metal, or alkaline earth metal cation, such as lithium, sodium, potassium, magnesium, calcium, or zinc, or a combination of such cations, can be the counterion that neutralizes the carboxylate anion of the salt. Particularly preferred are ionomers that are at least partially neutralized with potassium cations. Terpolymers can also be made from an olefin such as ethylene, an unsaturated carboxylic acid and a softening comonomer such as an alkyl (meth)acrylate providing "softer" resins which can be neutralized to form softer ionomers.<br>
A blend useful in the practice of the present invention comprises at least one E/X/Y acid copolymer composition where E is ethylene, X is a C3 to C8 α,ß ethylenically<br>
unsaturated carboxylic acid, and Y is a softening comonomer selected from alkyl acrylate and alkyl methacrylate wherein the alkyl groups have from one to eight carbon atoms, wherein X is about 2-30 weight % of the E/X/Y copolymer and Y can be present in an amount of from about 0 to about 40 weight % of the E/X/Y copolymer. The acid copolymers can be fully or partially neutralized by known and conventional means to provide acid copolymer ionomers (ionomers). Ionomers suitable for use in the practice of the present invention are known and commercially available from E.I. DuPont de Nemours and Company under the tradename of Surlyn®.<br>

EXAMPLES<br>
Materials Used<br>
Elvaloy AC 1224 is a copolymer blend of ethylene vinyl acetate and ethylene methacrylic acid copolymers, each available from E.I. DuPont de Nemours and Company (DuPont).<br>
Glycerol monostearate (GMS) (or potentially esters of polyglycerols), or sorbitol monostearate can be useful in the practice of the present invention.<br><br><br>
General Procedures<br>
Films of blends were prepared by blending copolymers of Elvaloy® AC 1224, commercially available from DuPont, with different levels of the RF enhancers, between 5% and 15%, and extruding the blends on a prism extruder to produce film between 6 and 12-mil thick, and these were tested for weldability. Two layers of the film were backed by Kapton® sheet and placed between the electrodes of an RF source, under a slight positive pressure and exposed for generally 2 seconds.<br>
Dielectric measurements can be used to measure RF adsorption. Alternatively a simple relative method is to measure the effect of introducing a material into the capacitance area of an alternating signal and measure the effect on the signal width or 'Q value' (frequency divided by width). A lowering of the Q value indicates adsorption, and since this is relative for a given circuit a percentage lowering of Q is a useful value. Welding experiments can be carried out, by subjecting a pair of film samples to an alternating field, for a fixed time, under a certain pressure. Table 1<br>

The weld performance was rated on an arbitrary scale. A value of 4 is standard for conventional weldable compositions. Factors such as film thickness, time and voltage can affect the results.<br>
0	- Negligible adhesion between the films<br>
1	- Noticeable adhesion<br>
2	- Sufficient adhesion to deform the film on peeling<br>
3	- Tearing of the film instead of peeling along some part of weld<br>
4	- Tearing of the film with no peeling along entire weld<br>
