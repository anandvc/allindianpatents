				<td>USE OF LOW-GLYCEMIC SWEETENERS IN FOOD AND BEVERAGE COMPOSITIONS<br>
CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION<br>
This application claims priority from U.S. Application Serial Number 10/243,283, filed September 13, 2002, which is herein incorporated by reference.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to low-glycemic sweeteners, food products containing low-glycemic sweeteners, and methods of producing such products from blends of sucrose and an acceptor selected from the group consisting of a sugar or sugar alcohol having free hydroxyl groups at one or more of carbon positions numbers 2, 3 and 6 (also referred to as the C-2, C-3 and C-6 positions) that can accept a glucose imit from sucrose, that are reacted with a glucansucrase enzyme. The resulting products have low glycemic index, and are useftil in any application that includes a product having both sweetness and a low glycemic index.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Typical com syrups that are useful in the production of beverages, sports drinks, and other food applications are known. It would be desirable, however, to have available for use in beverages, sports drinks, and otter food appUcations, as required, a product having sweetness similar to that of com symps, preferably with mouth-feel and functionality similar to typical com symps, and having a lower glycemic index.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is accordingly an object of the present invention to provide a process for preparing new and unproved food products such as animal feed, beverages, bakery products, confectionery products, condiments, and snacks, characterized by having sweetness and a lower glycemic index. Glycemic index is correlatable with glucose release and can be tested using the procedure provided in Example 5, below.<br>
In accordance with the present invention, it has been found that the above and still further objects are achieved by utilizing as a sweetener for a food or a beverage, a product having low glycemic index.

glucansucrase enzyme, such as the enzyme isolated from Leuconostoc mesenteroides (LM)<br>
strain NllRL-B-21297.	"	"	■<br>
These and other objects and advantages of the present invention will be apparent to those skilled in the art from the following detailed description and claims.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
In accordance with the present invention, it has been found that the above and still further objects are achieved by utilizing as a low-glycemic sweetener in the making of food products. Glycemic index is correlatable with glucose release. The making and use of the low-glycemic sweetener is described below.<br>
Making the low-glvcemic sweetener<br>
The acceptor and sucrose are reacted with a glucansucrase enzyme that will transfer glucose units from sucrose to an acceptor carbohydrate and will release fructose and glucose oligosaccarides of various lengths. The resultant product may have a level of sweetness similar to that of a com syrup, and a mouth-feel and functionality similar to that of com syrup. In addition, and more significantly for the present process, the resulting product is<br><br>
characterized by having a lower glycemic index as compared to the combination of the reactants (sucrose and acceptors) that are not reacted with enzyme.<br>
The acceptor can be selected from the group consisting of a sugar or a sugar alcohol having free hydroxyl groups at one or more carbon positions numbers 2,3 and 6 that can accept a glucose unit from sucrose. The acceptor can be in the form of syrup or syrup solids. Exemplary of the syrups or syrup solids suitable for use herein are maltose, maltotriose, panose, high maltose (over 40%) com syrup, medium to low DE (dextrose equivalent) com syrup, raffinose, cellobiose, maltitol, maltotriose, maltotefrose, glucose, isomaltose, isomaltitol, barley syrup and syrup solids, rice syrup and syrup solids, lactose, whey permeate, tapioca starch syrup and syrup solids, nigerose, kojibiose, isomaltoohgosaccharide, hydrogenated starch syrup, potato starch syrup and syrup solids, com syrup and syrup solids, and the like. Exemplary of the syrups that are suitable for use in the blends are, but not limited to, SATINSWEETTm available from Cargill, Incorporated, that contains minimal 55 to 70 weight % maltose and 45 to 30% weight % of glucose and other glucose-containing oligomers. In a preferred embodiment, the symp or syrup solids used herein comprise an amount of from about 2 to about 99% by weight of maltose.<br>
The glucansucrase enzymes that can be used in the reaction to produce the low-glycemic sweetener include, but not limited to, LM strains NRRL-B 1121, 1143,1149,1254, 1297,1298,1355,1374,1375,1377,1399,1402,1433,23185,23186, 23188,23311,742, 523, 21297, and other enzymes provided herein. These strains can be cultured and the enzymes can be isolated using any method known in the art, such as the method provided below. For example, a process for producing the low-glycemic sweetener suitable for use herein comprises reacting, or incubating, blends of sucrose and syrup or syrup solids, as an acceptor carbohydrate, in varying ratios of components, in a total sugar concentration of from about 2 to about 40%, with an amount of the glucansucrase from LM and other lactic acid bacteria, sufficient to provide a low glycemic index product. The reaction, or incubation, is carried out at a temperature of about 30 to about 45° C, for a period of about 1 to about 48 hours.<br>
The characteristics of the low-glycemic sweetener can be altered by controlling the ratio of sucrose to acceptor. Generally, the glycemic index of the product produced will decrease as the ratio of sucrose to acceptor increases. For example, it is expected that a product made using a ratio of 1:1 (sucrose to acceptor) will have a higher glycemic index<br><br>
than that of a product created using a ratio of 4:1 (sucrose to acceptor). Therefore, the invention provides methods of making low-glycemic sweeteners using ratios of sucrose to acceptor of at least 4:1, 5:1,6:1, 7:1, 8:1, 9:1, and 10:1. Accordingly, the invention also provides food products made by such methods.<br>
The low-glycemic sweeteners can also be characterized bjrthe linkages between the glucose molecules in the glucose oligosaccaride. In some embodiments the glucose oligosaccaride has both alpha 1,3 and alpha 1,6 linkages, and the glucose oligosaccaride product may also contain, but is not limited to, other linkages such as alpha 1,4. In some embodiments that low-glycemic sweetener will have at least 20% alpha 1,3 linkages and in other embodiments the low-glycemic sweetener will have at least 20% alpha 1,3 linkages and at least 20% alpha 1,6 linkages.<br>
The low-glycemic sweetener can also be subsequently processed to remove a portion of, or all of, the fructose, thus yielding a low-glycemic sweetener that is fructose depleted. Fructose can be removed from the low-glycemic sweetener using any method known in the art, for example by using column chromatography. Generally, the low-glycemic sweetener contains less than 50% fructose.<br>
More specifically, the low-glycemic sweetener can be made from syrups that contain one or more acceptors. When the acceptor used is in the form of a syrup it can be blended using any technique known in the art. For example the blends may be produced by physical mixing of the sucrose and the syrup or syrup solids. As used in the examples herein, the blends of sucrose and syrup or syrup solids were produced by blending. In several of the examples herein, there are exemplified blends of sucrose and com syrup comprising about 65 weight percent maltose (SATIN-SWEET™ 65) comprising sucrose to SATIN-SWEET™ 65 com syrup in ratios of 3:2,2:1, and 5:2 on a dry weight basis. However, as mentioned herein, any ratio of sucrose to syrup or syrup solids such as from about 20:1 to 1:20 sucrose to syrup or syrup solids, may be used that allows a low glycemic index product to be obtained. More precisely, in several of the examples, there was utilized SATINSWEET™ 65 com syrup, a trademarked product available from Cargill, Incorporated that contains minimal 65% by weight maltose and 35% by weight glucose and other glucose-containing oligomers.<br><br>
Uses of the low-glvcemic sweetener<br>
The low-glycemic sweeteners described herein, and exemplified in the Examples are expected to be useful in the preparation of food and beverage compositions characterized by having a lower glycemic index than food products made using conventional sweeteners. It is expected that the low-glycemic sweeteners described herein may be successfully incorporated as sweeteners in any food product where conventional sweeteners are used, including animal feed, beverages, confectioneries, condiments, energy drinks, chewing gum, ice cream, desserts, pet food, and the like, where it is desired to produce low glycemic foods or drinks. The low-glycemic sweeteners maybe incorporated in the food or beverage compositions in any desired amount, depending on the specified apphcation. For example, the low-glycemic sweetener may be incorporated in an amount ranging fi-om about 0.1 to about 99.9% by weight of the food or beverage composition.<br>
Food products containing the low-glycemic sweetener will generally have a glycemic index that is at least 10% lower than the glycemic index of a substantially similar product made using conventional sweeteners. Conventional sweeteners as used herein refers sucrose-based sweeteners, such as granulated sugar, liquid sugar, and brown sugar, starch-based sweeteners, such as dextrose based products including maltodextrin, com syrup and com syrup solids, and dextrose, fructose based products including high fructose com syrup and crystalline finctose, and other starch-based products such as maltose and malt symp. Other specialty sweeteners are also used including honey and artificial honey, lactose, maple syrup and maple sugar, and firuit-derived sweeteners.<br>
The invention will be more readily understood by reference to the following examples. There are, of course, many other forms of this invention which will become obvious to one skilled in the art, once the invention has been fully disclosed, and it will accordingly be recognized that these examples are given for the purpose of illustration only, and are not to be construed as limiting the scope of this invention in any way.<br>
Examples<br>
Examples 1 and 2, provided below teach how to make the low-glycemic sweetener described herein. Additionally, the examples described below provide results showmg that the low-glycemic sweetener described herein is low-glycemic. This is shown by in vitro<br><br>
experimentation using glucoamylase assays to estimate glycemic index (Example 3, Studies 1-3), and experimentation using rat intestinal powder to estimate glycemic index (Example 4) and finally through human clinical trials (Example 5). Example 6 provides the results relating to low glycemic sweeteners made with various enzymes, and example 7 provides food compositions that are created using the low-glycemic sweetener.<br>
Example 1 - Method of Preparing Enzymes<br>
LM strain NRKL-B-523 or NRRL-B-21297 was cultured in a 200-liter fermenter at 30°C with mixing at 150 revolutions per minute (rpm) in a medium containing 0.22 weight % Hy Pep 1510 (enzymatic hydrolysis of soy), 0.22 weight % HY-YEST 412 (spray-dried extract from primary grown baker"s yeast), both available from Quest, Intemational, Hoffinan Estates, Illinois, 0.2 weight % ammonium cifrate, 0.5 weight % sodium citrate, 0.01 weight % magnesium sulfate, 0.005 weight % manganese sulfate and 0.2 weight percent potassium phosphate (dibasic) supplemented with 2 weight percent sucrose and 2 weight percent SATIN-SWEET™ 65 com syrup comprising 65 weight percent maltose for 18 hours. The resulting cultural supematant was clarified by filtration of the supematant through 0.1 micron Amicon hollow fiber filters, available from Millipore, Bedford, Massachusetts, at 4°C. Enzyme from the clarified supematant was purified and concentrated from other medium components by ultrafilfration through a 50,000 k D molecular weight Pellicon-2 polyethersulfone cassette diafiltration membrane, available from Millipore, Bedford, Massachusetts. 20 liters of enzyme solution was obtained, which is 10-fold concentrated as compared to the starting cultural supemataot.<br>
Example 2 - Various Acceptors Usefiil for Producing Low-Glvcemic Sweeteners<br>
Enzyme from the LM NERL-B-21297 strain was tested to determine the suitability of various acceptors. Enzyme was prepared using the methods described herein.<br>
In determining the suitability of the preparation of the sucrose/acceptor products, 0.4% by weight of each sucrose and acceptor were mixed with enzyme solution in 0.01 M sodium gluconate buffer, pH 6, and the reaction proceeded for 2 hours at 37°C.<br>
The carbohydrate profiles of products generated by the enzyme reactions with the blends of sucrose and syraps and symp solids herein, were analyzed by high performance<br><br>
liquid chromatography (HPLC) using two (2) Bio-Rad Aminex HPX-42A carbohydrate columns (300 mm x 7.8 mm) available jGrom Bio-Rad, Hercules, California, in succession, with water as the eluate at 0.2 ml/min, at a temperature of 65° C.<br>
The reaction rate was estimated based on the amount of oligosaccharaides generated from each acceptor and normalized against the fructose concentration in each reaction. The results are reported below in Table 2.0. The values reported for oligosaccharides to fructose are for DP3-DP7 minus starting material.<br><br>
From the data it is observed that maltose is the best acceptor for the enzyme from strain NRRL-B-21297, followed by panose and isomaltose.<br>
As part of this evaluation, other sugars were evaluated for suitability as acceptors. The sugars were xylose, arabinose and myo-inositol. These sugars were found to be not as effective acceptors as the acceptors hsted in Table 2.0 within the two (2) hour reaction time.<br>
Example 3 - In Vitro Studies Using Glucoamvlase to Estimate Glvcemic Index<br><br>
The three studies described below provide data relating to the carbohydrate profiles of the various low-glycemic sweeteners, as well as the glycemic index estimate (as identified using glucoamylase and HCl) of the various low-glycemic sweeteners.<br>
A.       Study 1<br>
LM strain NRIlL-B-21297 was cultured as described above, and the recovered enzymes were resuspended in 0.01 M gluconate buffer (pH 6), up to the original supernatant volume, together with 8% by weight of total sugars, in ratios of 3:2,2:1; and 5:2, of sucrose to SATIN-SWEET™ com syrup containing 65 weight % maltose (65HM herein). The enzyme reaction was allowed to proceed for 16 hours at a temperature of 37°C, with mild agitation.<br>
At the completion of the reaction, the resultant products were analyzed by the HPLC method described herein.<br>
The resulting three (3) products contain the sugar profiles reported in Table 3.0.<br>
TABLE 3.0<br><br><br>
*  Table 1. Carbohydiate profiles of i. mesenteroides B-21297 enzymes incubated wifli sucrose and SATIN-SWEET™" 65 com syrup at three ratios. Numbers represent percentages of total carbohydrates in the final product. Abbreviations: DP = degree of polymeaization; higher = sugars with a DP&gt;8.<br>
To obtain an estimate of the glycemic index of the products, in vitro digestibility assays, using glucoamylase and acid hydrolysis to simulate digestion, were performed. An amount of 0.08% of glucoamylase, (v/v) available from Genencor, Rochester, New York, under the tradename, Optidex L-400, was used at a temperature of 37" C, for a period of 1 hour, with mild agitation. The reactions were stopped by the addition of hydrochloric acid (HCl) to a final concentration of 0.24M (molar), and heating at 90° C for a period of 5 minutes. The amount of glucose released was measured by HPLC using an Aminex HPX-87H ion exclusion column, available from Bio-Rad, with O.OIN (normal) sulfuric acid as the mobile phase.<br>
The results are reported in Table 3.1 below.<br>
TABLE 3.1 (% Glucose Release)*<br><br>
*Table 2. Amount of oligosaccharides present in products generated by L mesenteroides B-21297 en2ymes and their respective glucose release values as determined by the in vitro digestibility assays with glucoamylase.<br>
From the data in Tables 3.0 and 3.1, it is observed that the three products comprising blends of sucrose and com syrup containing 65 weight % maltose, in varying ratios, are sweet, since the content of fructose ranges from about 30 to about 37%. Furthermore, it is expected that the three products will be low glycemic, imique mouth-feel and fimctionality in various food and beverage applications.<br>
Study 2<br><br>
Cultural supernatant of LM NRRL-B-21297 was used to convert blends of sucrose and com syrup or com symp solids containing either 65 weight% maltose (65HM), or 96 weight % maltose (96HM), to low-glycemic sweeteners. In so doing, a total of 20 weight %, or 30 weight %, sugars in water, of various ratios of sucrose to acceptor, containing either 65 or 96 weight percent maltose, were incubated with 10 weight % of concentrated enzyme solution, at a temperature of 37°C for a period of about 16 hours. Enzyme activity was inactivated by heat treatment at a temperature of 121C for a period of 10 minutes. The resulting syrups were filtered through 0.7 micron glass fiber filter (Pall Corporation, Ann Arbor, Michigan), treated with activated carbon, and treated with cation and anion exchange resins to remove color, protein, and ions. The products were filtered through Whatman No. 3 filter paper (Whatman International, Ltd. Maidstone, England) to remove carbon fines. The resulting low-glycemic sweeteners were then evaporated at a temperature of 70°C to 80% dry solids.<br>
The carbohydrate profile of the resulting low-glycemic sweeteners are reported in the following Table 3.2.<br><br><br>
glycemic sweeteners (LGS), identified as LGSl through LGS5. The results of the glucose release are reported in Table 3.3.<br><br>
From the data in Tables 3.2 and 3.3, it is observed that the products of the present invention are sweet, having a fiructose content ranging from 30 to 37 weight %, and that the products of the present invention are characterized by having reduced glucose release rate compared to products produced in the absence of the reaction with the enzyme. Thus, the products of the present invention are expected to have a lower glycemic index.<br>
Study 3<br>
In this example, there were provided two products from blends of sucrose and com syrap solids containing 96 weight % maltose in the ratio of 3:2, sucrose to com syrup solids.<br>
Enzymes were obtained from LM strains NRRL-B-523 and NRRL-B-742 using the procedures provided above. The enzyme reaction was carried out using the same procedure as described in Studies 1, with the exceptions that the enzymes differ and the blend of sucrose and acceptor differ from that used in Example 1.<br>
The carbohydrate profile of the resulting two (2) low-glycemic sweeteners are reported in Table 3.4.<br><br><br>
With respect to the two (2) low-glycemic sweeteners of Example 3, in vitro digestibility assays described above, were carried out to compare the percent glucose that was released in the enzyme treated low-glycemic sweetener with the percent glucose released in the starting blend of sucrose and com syrup solids containing 96 weight percent maltose that has not been reacted with the enzyme. It was determined that the in vitro digestibility showed a glucose release rate of 41% for the product prepared using the strain LM NRRL-B-523 enzyme, and 40% for the product prepared using the strain LM NIlIlL-B-742 enzyme, as compared to the control syrup solids blend without enzyme treatment, where the glucose release is 100%.<br>
Therefore, it is apparent that the products of Example 3 are estimated to have a lower glycemic index than that of the starting blend of sucrose and com syrup solids. It is expected that the products of Example 3 will be useful in the preparation of food and beverage compositions having low glycemic index.<br>
Example 4-In Vitro Studies Using Rat Intestinal Powder<br>
The results provided in this example are derived from in vitro digestability assays using rat intestinal powder available from Sigma/Aldrich, Saint Louis, Missouri, Catalog Number 1-1630). In each reaction, 2% by weight of total carbohydrate was mixed with 1.25 weight % of rat intestinal powder in 0.025M phosphate buffer, at pH of 6.5 and incubated at 37°C for up to 12 hours. Free glucose concentration in the reaction mixture was analyzed over time by the HPLC method described above.<br><br>
Low-glycemic sweeteners were made using enzyme preparations from LM NRRL-B-21297, as described above. The resulting reaction products have sucrose to maltose weight ratios of 1:1,1.5:1,2.33:1,4:1,9:1, and 19:1. The reaction products were tested in the in vitro digestibility assay described above, which used rat intestinal powder. The results of the evaluation are reported below in Table 4.0.<br>
Table 4.0<br><br>
As a comparison, maltose is 88% digested in 4 hours using this method of assay.<br>
In Table 4.0, the free glucose concentration in the reaction mixture was analyzed over time by the HPLC method described herein. The results in Table 7 show that the higher the sucrose to maltose weight ratio, the lower is the digestibility. From the data, it appears that the digestibility value reaches a plateau when the sucrose to maltose weight ratio is 9:1 and greater. It is furthermore reasonable to assume, from the data in Table 7, that the sucrose/maltose reaction products are low-glycemic sweeteners.<br>
Example 5 -In vivo Studies of Glvcemic Response to Low-Glycemic Sweeteners in Humans<br>
Samples were initially tested to determine their carbohydrate profile, prior to determining their in vivo gjycemic effect. The control in the human trial was 42 high fructose com syrup (HFCS). The low-glycemic sweeteners used were produced using enzymes isolated from LM NRRL-B-21297 in reactions with sucrose and maltose in ratios of 9:1 and 4:l(LGS9:landLGS4:l).<br><br><br><br>
The second sample is a drink comprising 50 grams, on dry weight basis, of the low glycemic sweetener having a sucrose to maltose weight ratio of 4:1, and 200 grams of water.<br>
The third sample is a drink comprising 50 grams, on dry weight basis of 42 high fructose com syrup that contains 42% fructose and 200 grams water.<br>
Each of the three (3) drinks were consumed by 10 human subjects, on three (3) separate times.<br>
The drinks containing the low-glycemic sweetener were found to produce a smaller rise in blood glucose response when compared to the drinks containing 42 high fructose com syrup as a sweetener. More particularly, assuming a rise in blood glucose value (area under the curve) of 100% for the drink containing the 42 high fructose com syrup used as the control, the value resulting from the.drink containing the low-glycemic sweetener having a sucrose to maltose weight ratio of 4:1 is 89% of the control, and the value resulting from the drink containing the low-glycemic sweetener having a sucrose to maltose weight ratio of 9:1 is 55% of the control. These results, indicate that the low-glycemic sweetener described herein; having the weight ratios of 4:1 and 9:1 are low glycemic index products. Moreover, the data indicates that the low-glycemic swseetener having a weight ratio of 9:1 is a more effective in lowering the glycemic index of a food product, than the low-glycemic sweetener having a weight ratio of 4:1.<br>
Example 6 - Low-glycemic sweeteners produced from other LM Strains<br>
The following XJW strains were obtained from the Agricultural Research Service Culture Collection (USDA) NRRL-B: 1121,1143,1149,1254,1297,1298,1374,1375, 1377,1399,1402,1433, 23185,23186,23188, and 23311. Fifty-milliliter cultures were grown using LM media (which is the media described in Example 1, except HyPep and Hy-yest are replaced by 0.15% polypeptone, 0.15% beef extract and 0.15% yeast extract) supplemented with sucrose and maltose (4% total sugar) at a 2 to 1 ratio. Cultures were grown at 32° C with agitation for 20 h. Sugar profiles were identified by HPLC, as previously described. Specific strains were further grown as 1 L cultures using the same media and cells were harvested by centrifugation. The remaining supematants were passed through a 50 K molecular weight cut-off filtration unit to generate a concentrated enzyme preparation (7-1 OX concentrate). Enzyme preparations were used to produce low-glycemic sweeteners (5% total sugar at 9:1 sucrose to maltose) and in vifro digestibility assays were performed as previously described.<br><br><br><br>
To get an estimate of the glycemic index values of the newly generated syrups, in vitro digestibility values of selected syrups were determined using the previously described rat intestinal powder assay (Table 6.1).<br><br>
By directly correlating the percent glucose released in digestibility assays to glycemic index, it is expected that syrups generated by some of the other strains will have glycemic index (GI) values (for a given sucroseracceptor ratio) similar to syrups generated by strain NRRL-B-21297.<br>
