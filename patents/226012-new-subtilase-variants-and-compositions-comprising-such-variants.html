SUBTILASE VARIANTS<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to novel subtilase variants exhibiting alterations relative to the parent subtilase in one or more properties including: Wash performance, thermal stability, storage stability or catalytic activity. The variants of the invention are suitable for use in e.g. cleaning or detergent compositions, such as laundry detergent compositions and dish wash compositions, including automatic dish wash compositions. The present invention also relates to isolated DNA sequences encoding the variants, expression vectors, host cells, and methods for producing and using the variants of the invention. Further, the present invention relates to cleaning and detergent compositions comprising the variants of the invention.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
in the detergent industry enzymes have for more than 30 years been implemented in washing formulations. Enzymes used in such formulations comprise proteases, lipases, amylases, cellulases, as well as other enzymes, or mixtures thereof. Commercially the most important enzymes are proteases.<br>
An increasing number of commercially used proteases are protein engineered variants of naturally occurring wild type proteases, e.g. Durazym®, Relase®, Alcalase®, Savinase®, Primase®, Duralase®, Esperase®, Ovozyme® and Kannase® (Novozymes A/S), Maxatase™, Maxacal™, Maxapem™, Properase™, Purafect™, Purafect OxP™, FN2™, FN3™ and FN4™ (Genencor International, Inc.). Further, a number of protease variants are described in the art. A thorough list of prior art protease variants is given in WO 99/27082.<br>
However, even though a number of useful protease variants have been described, there is still a need for new improved proteases or protease variants for a number of industrial uses such as laundry or hard surface cleaning. Therefore, an object of the present invention is to provide improved subtilase variants for such purposes.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Thus, in a first aspect the present invention relates to a subtilase variant comprising at least<br>
a) an insertion, substitution or deletion of one of the amino acid residues<br>

Concerning alignment and numbering, reference is made to Fig. 1 which shows an alignment between subtilisin BPN'(a) (BASBPN) and subtilisin 309 (b) (BLSAVl). This alignment is in this patent application used as a reference for numbering the residues.<br>
DEFINITONS<br>
Prior to discussing this invention in further detail, the following terms and conventions will first<br><br>
For a detailed description of the nomenclature of amino acids and nucleic acids, we refer to WO 00/71691 beginning at page 57 hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
NOMENCLATURE AND CONVENTIONS FOR DESIGNATION OF VARIANTS<br>
In describing the various subtilase enzyme variants produced or contemplated according to<br>
the invention, the following nomenclatures and conventions have been adapted for ease of<br>
reference:<br>
A frame of reference is first defined by aligning the isolated or parent enzyme with subtilisin<br>
BPN' (BASBPN).<br>
The alignment can be obtained by the GAP routine of the GCG package version 9.1 to number the variants using the following parameters: gap creation penalty = 8 and gap extension penalty = 8 and all other parameters kept at their default values.<br>
Another method is to use known recognized alignments between subtilases, such as the alignment indicated in WO 91/00345. In most cases the differences will not be of any importance.<br>
Thereby a number of deletions and insertions will be defined in relation.to BASBPN (SEQ ID NO.1). In Fig. 1, subtilisin 309 (SEQ iD NO.2) has 6 deletions in positions 36u58, 158, 162, 163, and 164 in comparison to BASBPN. These deletions are in Fig. 1 indicated by asterixes<br>
For a detailed description of the nomenclature of modifications introduced in a polypeptide by genetic manipulation we refer to WO 00/71691 page 7-12, hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
Proteases<br>
Enzymes cleaving the amide linkages in protein substrates are classified as proteases, or (interchangeably) peptidases (see Walsh, 1979, Enzymatic Reaction Mechanisms. W.H. Freeman and Company, San Francisco, Chapter 3).<br>
Numbering of amino acid positions/residues<br>
If nothing else is mentioned the amino acid numbering used herein correspond to that of the subtilase BPN' (BASBPN) sequence. For further description of the BPN' sequence, see Fig. 1, SEQ ID NO:1 or Siezen et a/., Protein Engng. 4 (1991) 719-737.<br><br>
Serine proteases<br>
A serine protease is an enzyme which catalyzes the hydrolysis of peptide bonds, and in which there is an essential serine residue at the active site (White, Handler and Smith, 1973 "Principles of Biochemistry" Fifth Edition, McGraw-Hill Book Company, NY, pp. 271-272). The bacterial serine proteases have molecular weights in the 20,000 to 45,000 Dalton range. They are inhibited by diisopropylfluorophosphate. They hydrolyze simple terminal esters and are similar in activity to eukaryotic chymotrypsin, also a serine protease. A more narrow term, alkaline protease, covering a sub-group, reflects the high pH optimum of some of the serine proteases, from pH 9.0 to 11.0 (for review, see Priest (1977) Bacteriological Rev. 41 711-753).<br>
Subtilases<br>
A sub-group of the serine proteases tentatively designated subtilases has been proposed by Siezen et a/., Protein Engng. 4 (1991) 719-737 and Siezen et al. Protein Science 6 (1997) 501-523. They are defined by homology analysis of more than 170 amino acid sequences of serine proteases previously referred to as subtilisin-like proteases. A subtilisin was previously often defined as a serine protease produced by Gram-positive bacteria or fungi, and according to Siezen et al. now is a subgroup of the subtilases. A wide variety of subtilases have been identified, and the amino acid sequence of a number of subtilases has been determined. For a more detailed description of such subtilases and their amino acid sequences reference is made to Siezen et al. (1997).<br>
One subgroup of the subtilases, I-S1 or "true" subtilisins, comprises the "classical" subtilisins, such as subtilisin 168 (BSS168), subtilisin BPN\ subtilisin Carlsberg (ALCALASE®, NOVOZYMES A/S), and subtilisin DY (BSSDY).<br>
A further subgroup of the subtilases, I-S2 or high alkaline subtilisins, is recognized by Siezen et al. (supra). Sub-group I-S2 proteases are described as highly alkaline subtilisins and comprises enzymes such as subtilisin PB92 (BAALKP) (MAXACAL®, Genencor International Inc.), subtilisin 309 (SAVINASE®, NOVOZYMES A/S), subtilisin 147 (BLS147) (ESPERASE®, NOVOZYMES A/S), and alkaline elastase YaB (BSEYAB).<br>
"SAVINASE©"<br>
SAVINASE® is marketed by NOVOZYMES A/S. It is subtilisin 309 from S. Lentus and differs from BAALKP only in one position (N87S). SAVINASE® has the amino acid sequence designated b) in Fig. 1 and in SEQ ID NO:2.<br>
Parent subtilase<br>
The term "parent subtilase" describes a subtilase defined according to Siezen et al. (1991 and<br><br>
1997). For further details see description of "Subtilases" above. A parent subtilase may also be a subtilase isolated from a natural source, wherein subsequent modifications have been made while retaining the characteristic of a subtilase. Furthermore, a parent subtilase may be a subtilase which has been prepared by the DNA shuffling technique, such as described by J.E. Ness et a/., Nature Biotechnology, 17, 893-896 (1999). Alternatively the term "parent subtilase" may be termed "wild type subtilase".<br>
For reference a table of the acronyms for various subtilases mentioned herein is provided, for further acronyms, see Siezen et ai, Protein Engng. 4 (1991) 719-737 and Siezen et al. Protein Science 6 (1997) 501-523.<br>

Modification(s) of a subtilase variant<br>
The term "modification(s)" used herein is defined to include chemical modification of a subtilase as well as genetic manipulation of the DNA encoding a subtilase. The modification(s) can be replacement(s) of the amino acid side chain(s), substitution(s), deletion(s) and/or insertions in or at the amino acid(s) of interest.<br>
Subtilase variant<br>
In the context of this invention, the term subtilase variant or mutated subtilase means a subtilase that has been produced by an organism which is expressing a mutant gene derived from a parent microorganism which possessed an original or parent gene and which produced a corresponding parent enzyme, the parent gene having been mutated in order to produce the mutant gene from which said mutated subtilase protease is produced wheo expressed in a suitable host.<br><br>
Homologous subtilase sequences<br>
The homology between two amino acid sequences is in this context described by the<br>
parameter "identity".<br>
In order to determine the degree of identity between two subtilases the GAP routine of the<br>
GCG package version 9,1 can be applied {infra} using the same settings. The output from the<br>
routine is besides the amino acid alignment the calculation of the "Percent Identity" between<br>
the two sequences.<br>
Based on this description it is routine for a person skilled in the art to identify suitable<br>
homologous subtilases, which can be modified according to the invention.<br>
Isolated polynucleotide<br>
The term "isolated", when applied to a polynucleotide, denotes that the polynucleotide has been removed from its natural genetic milieu and is thus free of other extraneous or unwanted coding sequences, and is in a form suitable for use within genetically engineered protein production systems. Such isolated molecules are those that are separated from their natural environment and include cDNA and genomic clones. Isolated DNA molecules of the present invention are free of other genes with which they are ordinarily associated, but may include naturally occurring 51 and 3' untranslated regions such as promoters and terminators. The identification of associated regions will be evident to one of ordinary skill in the art (see for example, Dynan and Tijan, Nature 316:774-78, 1985). The term "an isolated polynucleotide" may alternatively be termed "a cloned polynucleotide".<br>
Isolated protein<br>
When applied to a protein, the term "isolated" indicates that the protein has been removed<br>
from its native environment In a preferred form, the isolated protein is substantially free of<br>
other proteins, particularly other homologous proteins (i.e. "homologous impurities" (see<br>
below)).<br>
An isolated protein is more than 10% pure, preferably more than 20% pure, more preferably<br>
more than 30% pure, as determined by SDS-PAGE. Further it is preferred to provide the<br>
protein in a highly purified form, i.e., more than 40% pure, more Jhan 60% pure, more than<br>
80% pure, more preferably more than 95% pure, and most preferably more than 99% pure, as<br>
determined by SDS-PAGE.<br>
The term "isolated protein" may alternatively be termed "purified protein".<br>
Homologous impurities<br>
The term "homologous fmpurities" means any impurity (e.g. another polypeptide than the subtilase of the invention), which originate from the homologous cell where the subtilase of the<br><br>
invention is originally obtained from.<br>
Obtained from<br>
The term "obtained from" as used herein in connection with a specific microbial source, means that the polynucleotide and/or subtilase produced by the specific source, or by a cell in which a gene from the source has been inserted.<br>
Substrate<br>
The term "substrate" used in connection with a substrate for a protease should be interpreted in its broadest form as comprising a compound containing at least one peptide (amide) bond susceptible to hydrolysis by a subtilisin protease.<br>
Product<br>
The term "product" used in connection with a product derived from a protease enzymatic reaction should, in the context of the present invention, be interpreted to include the products of a hydrolysis reaction involving a subtilase protease. A product may be the substrate in a subsequent hydrolysis reaction.<br>
Wash Performance<br>
In the present context the term "wash performance" is used as an enzyme's ability to remove proteinaceous or organic stains present on the object to be cleaned during e.g. wash or hard surface cleaning. See also the wash performance test in Example 3 herein.<br>

c) one or more modifications in position 68, wherein said modification(s) comprise(s): deletion, insertion and/or substitution of an amino acid residue selected from the group consisting of K,H,RIEID,QIN,C.VILI!IP,M1F.W1Y,G,A1S and T.<br>
Further, variants of the present invention comprises at least one or more of the alterations Indicated in Table i and II, wherein<br>
(a)	the variants of Table i and II has protease activity, and<br>
(b)	each position corresponds to a position of the amino acid sequence of subtilisin BPN' (SEQIDNO:1).<br>
A subtilase variant of the first aspect of the invention may be a parent or wild-type subtilase identified and isolated from nature. Such a parent wild-type subtilase may be specifically screened for by standard techniques known in the art.<br>
One preferred way of doing this may be by specifically PCR amplify conserved DNA regions of interest from subtilases from numerous different microorganism, preferably different Bacillus strains.<br>
Subtilases are a group of conserved enzymes, in the sense that their DNA and amino acid sequences are homologous. Accordingly it is possible to construct relatively specific primers flanking the polynucleotide sequences of interest.<br>
Using such PCR primers to amplify DNA from a number of different microorganisms, preferably different Bacillus strains, followed by DNA sequencing of said amplified PCR fragments, it will be possible to identify strains which produce subtilase variants of the invention. Having identified the strain and a partial DNA sequence of such a subtilase of interest, it is routine work for a person skilled in the art to complete cloning, expression ar.d purification of such a subtilase. However, it Is envisaged that a subtilase variant of the invention is predominantly a variant of a parent subtilase.<br><br>
A subtilase variant suitable for the uses described herein may be constructed by standard techniques known in the art such as by site-directed/random mutagenesis or by DNA shuffling of different subtilase sequences. See the "Material and Methods" section and Example 1 herein (vide infra) for further details.<br>
As will be acknowledged by the skilled person, the variants described herein may comprise one or more further modifications, in particular one or more further substitutions or insertions. Moreover, the variants described herein may encompass mutation at more than just one position. For example the variant according to the invention may contain mutations at one position, two positions, three positions or more than three positions, such as four to eight positions.<br>
It is preferred that the parent subtilase belongs to the subgroups I-S1 or I-S2, especially subgroup I-S2, both for enzymes from nature or from the artificial creation of diversity, and for designing and producing variants from a parent subtilase.<br>
In relation to variants from subgroup I-S1, it is preferred to select a parent subtilase from the group consisting of BSS168 (BSSAS. BSAPRJ, BSAPRN, BMSAMP), BASBPN, BSSDY, BLSCAR (BLKERA, BLSCA1, BLSCA2, BLSCA3), BSSPRC, and BSSPRD, or functional variants thereof having retained the characteristic of sub-group I-S1.<br>
In relation to variants from subgroup I-S2 it is preferred to select a parent subtilase from the group consisting of BSAPRQ, BLS147 (BSAPRM, BAH101), BLSAVI (BSKSMK, 8AALKP, BLSUBL), BYSYAB, BAPB92, TVTHER, and BSAPRS, or functional variants thereof having retained the characteristic of sub-group I-S2.<br>
In particular, the parent subtilase is BLSAVI (Savinase®, NOVOZYMES A/S)( and a preferred subtilase variant of the invention is accordingly a variant of Savinase®.<br>
The present invention also encompasses any of the above mentioned subtilase variants in combination with any other modification to the amino acid sequence thereof. Especially combinations with other modifications known in the art to provide improved properties to the enzyme are envisaged. The art describes a number of subtilase variants with different improved properties and a number of those are mentioned in the "Background of the invention" section herein (vide supra). Those references are disclosed here as references to identify a subtilase variant, which advantageously can be combined with a subtilase variant described herein. Such combinations comprise the positions: 222 (improves oxidation stability), 218 (improves thermal stability), substitutions in the Ca2+-binding sites stabilizing the enzyme, e.g. position 76, and many other apparent from the prior art.<br><br>
In further embodiments a subtilase variant described herein may advantageously be combined with one or more modification(s) in any of the positions:<br>
27, 36, 56, 76, 87, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 120, 123, 159, 167, 170, 206, 218, 222, 224, 232, 235, 236, 245, 248, 252 and 274.<br>
Specifically, the following BLSAVI, BLSUBL, BSKSMK, and BAALKP modifications are considered appropriate for combination:<br>

S99D+S101R+S103A+V104I+G160S+A194P+V199M+V205I+L217D,	-   S3T+V4I+S99D+<br>
S101R+S103A+V104I+G160S+V205I or N76D+V104A, or other combinations of the modifications K27R, *36D, S56P, N62D, V68A, N76D, S87N, G97N, S99SE, S101G, S103A, V104A, V104I, V104N, V104Y, S106A, H120D, H120N, N123S, G159D, Y167A, R170S, R170L, A194P, N204D, V205I, Q206E, L217D, N218S, N218D, M222S, M222A, T224S, A232V, K235L, Q236H, Q245R, N248D, N252K and T274A in combination with any one or more of the modification(s) mentioned above exhibit improved properties.<br>
A particular interesting variant is a variant, which, in addition to modifications according to the invention, contains the following substitutions: S101G+S103A+V104I+G159D+A232V+Q236H+Q245R+N248D+N252K.<br>
Moreover, subtilase variants of the main aspect(s) of the invention are preferably combined with one or more modification(s) in any of the positions 129, 131 and 194, preferably as 129K, 131H and 194P modifications, and most preferably as P129K, P131H and A194P modifications. Any of those modification(s) are expected to provide a higher expression level of the subtilase variant in the production thereof.<br>
The wash performance of a selected variant of the invention Ttay be tested in the wash performance test disclosed in Example 3 herein. The wash performance test may be<br><br>
employed to assess the ability of a variant, when incorporated in a standard or commercial detergent composition, to remove proteinaceous stains from a standard textile as compared to a reference system, namely the parent subtilase or a similar subtilase exhibiting an even better wash performance (incorporated in the same detergent system and tested under identical conditions). The enzyme variants of the present application were tested using the Automatic Mechanical Stress Assay (AMSA). With the AMSA test the wash performance of a large quantity of small volume enzyme-detergent solutions can be examined rapidly. Using this test, the wash performance of a selected variant can be initially investigated, the rationale being that if a selected variant does not show a significant improvement in the test compared to the parent subtilase, it is normally not necessary to carry out further test experiments.<br>
Therefore, variants which are particularly interesting for the purposes described herein, are such variants which, when tested in a commercial detergent composition such as a US type detergent, an Asian type, a European type or a Latin American type detergent as described in the wash performance test (Example 3), shows an improved wash performance as compared to the parent subtilase tested under identical conditions.<br>
The improvement in the wash performance may be quantified by calculating the so-called intensity value (Int) defined in Example 3, herein.<br>
In a very interesting embodiment of the invention, the variant of the invention, when tested in<br>
the wash performance test has a Performance Score (S) of at least 1, preferably a<br>
Performance Score of 2, where:<br>
S (2) = variant performs better than the reference at all three enzyme concentrations (5, 10<br>
and 30 nM),<br>
S (1) = variant performs better than the reference at one or two concentrations.<br>
Evidently, it is preferred that the variant of the invention fulfils the above criteria on at least the stated lowest level, more preferably at the stated highest level.<br>
PRODUCING A SUBTILASE VARIANT<br>
Many methods for cloning a subtilase and for introducing substitutions, deletions or insertions<br>
into genes (e.g. subtilase genes) are well known in the art.<br>
In general standard procedures for cloning of genes and introducing mutations-(random and/or site directed) into said genes may be used in order to obtain a subtilase variant of the invention. For further description of suitable techniques reference is mace to Example 1 herein (vide<br><br>
infra) and (Sambrook et al. (1989) Molecular cloning: A laboratory manual, Cold Spring Harbor lab., Cold Spring Harbor, NY; Ausubei, F. M. et al. (eds.) "Current protocols in Molecular Biology". John Wiley and Sons, 1995; Harwood, C. R., and Cutting, S. M. (eds.) "Molecular Biological Methods for Bacillus". John Wiley and Sons, 1990), and WO 96/34946.<br>
Further, a subtilase variant may be constructed by standard techniques for artificial creation of diversity, such as by DNA shuffling of different subtilase genes (WO 95/22625; Stemmer WPC, Nature 370:389-91 (1994)). DNA shuffling of e.g. the gene encoding Savlnase® with one or more partial subtilase sequences identified in nature, will after subsequent screening for improved wash performance variants, provide subtilase variants suitable for the purposes described herein.<br>
EXPRESSION VECTORS<br>
A recombinant expression vector comprising a DNA construct encoding the e nzyme o f t he invention may be any vector that may conveniently be subjected to recombinant DNA procedures.<br>
The choice of vector will often depend on the host cell into which it is to be introduced. Thus, the vector may be an autonomously replicating vector, i.e. a vector that exists as an extra-chromosomal entity, the replication of which is independent of chromosomal replication, e.g. a-plasmid.<br>
Alternatively, the vector may be one that on introduction into a host cell is integrated into the host cell genome in part or in its entirety and replicated together with the chromosome(s) into which it has been integrated.<br>
The vector is preferably an expression vector in which the DNA sequence encoding the enzyme of the invention is operably linked to additional segments required for transcription of the DNA. In general, the expression vector is derived from plasmid or viral DNA, or may contain elements of both. The term, "operably linked" indicates that the segments are arranged so that they function in concert for their intended purposes, e.g. transcription initiates in a promoter and proceeds through the DNA sequence coding for the enzyme.<br>
The promoter may be any DNA sequence that shows transcriptional activity in the host ceil of choice and may be derived from genes encoding proteins either homologous or heterologous to the hcs: cell.      .   .<br>
Examples of suitable promoters for use in bacterial host ceils :nclude the promoter of the<br><br>
Bacillus stearothermophilus maltogenic amylase gene, the Bacillus licheniformis alpha-amylase gene, the Bacillus amyloliquefaciens alpha-amyiase gene, the Bacillus subtilis alkaline protease gene, or the Bacillus pumilus xylosidase gene, or "the phage Lambda PR or PL promoters or the E. coli lac, trg or tac promoters.<br>
The DNA sequence encoding the enzyme of the invention may also, if necessary, be operably connected to a suitable terminator.<br>
The recombinant vector of the invention may further comprise a DNA sequence enabling the vector to replicate in the host cell in question. The vector may also comprise a selectable marker, e.g. a gene the product of which complements a defect in the host cell, or a gene encoding resistance to e.g. antibiotics like kanamycin, chloramphenicol, erythromycin., tetracycline., spectinomycine, or the like, or resistance to heavy metals or herbicides.<br>
To direct an enzyme of the present invention into the secretory pathway of the host ceils, a secretory signal sequence (also known as a leader sequence, prepro sequence or pre sequence) may be provided in the recombinant vector. The secretory signal sequence is joined to the DNA sequence encoding the enzyme in the correct reading frame. Secretory signal sequences are commonly positioned 5* to the DNA sequence encoding the enzyme. The secretory signal sequence may be that normally associated with the enzyme or may be from a gene encoding another secreted protein.<br>
The procedures used to ligate the DNA sequences coding for the present enzyme, the promoter and optionally the terminator and/or secretory signal sequence, respectively, or to assemble these sequences by suitable PCR amplification schemes, and to Insert them into suitable vectors containing the information necessary for replication or Integration, are well known to persons skilled in the art (cf., for instance, Sambrook et ai.( op.cit).<br>
HOST CELL<br>
The DNA sequence encoding the present enzyme introduced into the host cell may be either homologcus or heterologous to the host In question. If homologcus to the host cell, i.e. produced by the host cell in nature, it will typically be operably connected to another promoter sequence or, if applicable, another secretory signal sequence and/or terminator sequence than in its natural environment. The term "homologous" is intended to include a DNA sequence encoding an enzyme native to the host organism in question, The term "heterologous" is intended to include a DNA sequence not expressed by the host -ceil in nature. Thus, the DNA sequence may be from another organism, or it may be a synthetic sequence.<br><br>
The host cell into which the DNA construct or the recombinant vector of the invention is introduced may be any cell that is capable of producing the present enzyme and includes bacteria, yeast, fungi and higher eukaryotic cells including plants.<br>
Examples of bacterial host cells which, on cultivation, are capable of producing the enzyme of the invention are gram-positive bacteria such as strains of Bacillus, such as strains of B. subtilis, S. licheniformis, B, lenius, B. brevis, B. stearothemophilus, B. alkalophilus, B. amyloliouefaciens, B. coagulans, B. circulans, 3. lautus, B. mecatehum or 3. thuringiensis, or strains cf Streptomyces
The transformation of the bacteria may be effected by protoplast transformation, e!ectropcrationt conjugation, or by using competent ceils in a manner known per se (cf. Sambrcck et al., supra).<br>
When expressing the enzyme in bacteria such as E. coli, the enzyme may be retained in the cytoplasm, typically as insoluble granules (known as inclusion bodies), or may be directed to the peripiasmic space by a bacterial secretion sequence, in the former case, the cells are lysed and the granules are recovered and denatured after which the enzyme is refolded by diluting the denaturing agent. In the latter case, the enzyme may be recovered from the peripiasmic space by disrupting the cells, e.g. by sonication or osmotic shock, to release the contents of the peripiasmic space and recovering the enzyme.<br>
When expressing the enzyme in gram-positive bacteria such as Bacillus or Streptomyces strains, the enzyme may be retained in the cytoplasm, or may be directed to the extracellular medium by a bacterial secretion sequence, in the latter case, the enzyme may be recovered from the medium as described below.<br>
METHOD FOR PRODUCING A SUBTILASE VARIANT<br>
The present invention provides a method of producing an isolated enzyme according to the invention, wherein a suitable host cell, which has been transformed with a DNA sequence encoding :he enzyme, is cultured under conditions permitting the oroduction of the enzyme, and the resulting enzyme is recovered from the culture.<br>
When an expression vector comprising a DNA sequence encoding-;he enzyme is trans-formed into a heterologous host ceil it is possible to enable heterologous recombinant production of the enzyme of the invention. Thereby it is possible to make a highly purified subtilase<br><br>
composition, characterized in being free from homologous impurities.<br>
The medium used to culture the transformed host cells may be any conventional medium suitable for growing the host cells in question. The expressed subtilase may conveniently be secreted into the culture medium and may be recovered there-from by well-known procedures including separating the cells from the medium by centrifugation or filtration, precipitating proteinacecus components of the medium by means of a salt such as ammonium sulfate, followed by chromatographic procedures such as ion exchange chromatography, affinity chromatography, or the like.<br>

EXAMPLE 1<br>
CONSTRUCTION AND EXPRESSION OF ENZYME VARIANTS: SITE-DIRECTED MUTAGENESIS:<br>
Subtiiisin 309 (Savinase®) site-directed variants of the invention comprising specific insertions/deletions/substitutions are made by traditional cloning of DNA fragments (Sambrook et al., Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 2nd EdM Cold Scring Harbor, 1989) produced by PCR with oiigos containing the desired mutations.<br>
The template plasmid DNA may be pSX222, or an analogue of this containing a variant of subtiiisin 309. Mutations are introduced by oligo directed mutagenesis to the construction of variants.<br>
The subtiiisin 309 variants are transformed into E. coii, DNA purified from an over night culture of these transformants is transformed i nto B. subtiiishy restriction endonuclease digestion, purification of DNA fragments, ligation, transformation of B. subtilis. Transformation of B. subtilis is performed as described by Dubnau et al., 1971, J. Mol. Bioi. 56, pp. 209-221.<br>
SITE-DIRECTED MUTAGENESIS IN ORDER TO INTRODUCE MUTATIONS IN A SPECIFIC REGION:<br>
The overall strategy used to perform site-directed mutagenesis is:<br>
Mutagenic primers (oligonucleotides) are synthesized corresponding to the DNA sequence flanking the sites of mutation, separated by the DNA base pairs defining the insertions / deletions / substitutions.<br>
Subsequently, the resulting mutagenic primers are used in a PCR reaction with the modified plasmid pSX222. The resulting PCR fragment is purified and extended in a second PCR-reaction, the resulting PCR product is purified and extended in a third PCR-reaction before being digested by endonucleases and cloned into the E. coil - S. subtilis shuttle vector pSX222. The PCR reactions are performed under normal conditions. The plasmid DNA is transformed into E. coli by well-known techniques and one E. ooli colony is sequenced to confirm the mutation designed.<br>
Each of the variants listed in Table I at page 2 herein can be constructed as described above.<br><br>
In order to purify subtilase variants of the invention, the pSX222 expression plasmid comprising a variant of the invention was transformed into a competent 5. subtilis strain and fermented as described above.<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
PURIFICATION AND ASSESMENT OF ENZYM CONCENTRATION<br>
After fermentation purification of subtilisin variants is accomplished using Hydrophobic Charge<br>
induction Chromatography (HCIC) and subsequent vacuum filtration.<br>
To capture the enzyme, the HCIC uses a cellulose matrix to which 4-Mercapto-Ethyl-Pyridine<br>
(4-MEP) is bound.<br>
Beads of the cellulose matrix sized 30-100 pm are mixed with a media containing yeast extract<br>
and the transformed B. subtilis capable of secreting the subtilisin variants and incubated at pH<br>
9.5 in Unifilter® microplates.<br>
As 4-MEP is hydrophobic at pH &gt; 7 and the subtilisin variants are hydrophobic at pH 9.5 a<br>
hydrophobic association is made between the secreted enzyme and the 4-MEP on the beads.<br>
After incubation the media and cell debris is removed by vacuum filtration while the beads and<br>
enzyme are kept on the filter.<br>
To elute the enzyme from the beads the pH is now lowered by washing the filter with an   ~<br>
elution buffer (pH 5). Hereby the enzymes part from the beads and can be retrieved from the<br>
buffer.<br>
The concentration of the purified subtilisin enzyme variants is assessed by active site titration<br>
(AST).<br>
The  purified   enzyme   is   incubated   with   the   high  affinity  inhibitor  CI-2A  at  different<br>
concentrations to inhibit a varying amount of the active sites. The protease and inhibitor binds<br>
to each other at a 1:1 ratio and accordingly the enzyme concentration can be directly related<br>
to the concentration of inhibitor, at which all protease is inactive. To measure the residual<br>
protease activity, a substrate (0.6 mM Suc-AIa-Ala-Pro-Phe-pNA in Tris/HCI buffer) is added<br>
after the incubation with inhibitor and during the following 4 minutes the development of the<br>
degradation product pNA(paranitrophenol) is measured periodically at 405 nm on an Eiisa<br>
Reader.<br>
Each of the variants of the invention listed in Table I at page 2 herein was purified according to<br>
the above procedure and subsequently the enzyme concentration was determined.<br>
Known concentrations of the variants of Table I were testec for wash performance in detergents as described below.<br><br>
EXAMPLE 3<br>
WASH PERFORMANCE OF SAV1NASE VARIANTS<br>
In order to asses the wash performance of selected subtilase variants in a commercial detergent base composition, washing experiments was performed. The enzyme variants of the present application were tested using the Automatic Mechanical Stress Assay (AMSA). With the AMSA test the wash performance of a large quantity of small volume enzyme-detergent solutions can be examined. The AMSA plate has a number of slots for test solutions and a lid firmly squeezing the textile swatch to be washed against all the slot openings. During the washing time, the plate, test solutions, textile and lid are vigorously shaken to bring the test solution in contact with the textile and apply mechanical stress. For further description see WO 02/42740 especially the paragraph "Special method embodiments" at page 23-24.<br><br>
The Latin American type detergent was composed according to the provisions in Detergent Example 1 at page 24 herein. Water hardness was adjusted to 6-9°dH by addition of CaCI2 and MgCI2 (Ca2+:Mg2+ = 4:1) to the test system. After washing the textile pieces were flushed in tap water and air-dried.<br><br><br>

Example 2 at page 24 herein. Water hardness was adjusted to 15°dH by addition of CaCi2*2H20; MgC!2*6H20; NaHC03 (Ca2+:Mg2+:HC03" = 4:1:10) to the test system. After washing the textile pieces were flushed in tap water and air-dried.<br>
The performance of the enzyme variant is measured as the brightness of the colour of the textile sampies washed with that specific enzyme variant. Brightness can also be expressed as the intensity of the light reflected from the textile sample when luminated with white light. When the textile is stained the intensity of the reflected light is lower, than that of a clean textile. Therefore the intensity of the reflected light can be used to measure wash performance of an enzyme variant.<br>
Colour measurements are made with a professional flatbed scanner (PFU DL2400pro), which is used to capture an image of the washed textile samples. The scans are made with a resolution of 200 dpi and with an output colour dept of 24 bits. In order to get accurate results, the scanner is frequently calibrated with a Kodak reflective IT8 target.<br>
To extract a value for the light intensity from the scanned images, a special designed software application is used (Novozymes Color Vector Analyzer). The program retrieves.the 24 bit pixel values from the image and converts them into values for red, green and blue (RGB). The intensity value (Int) is calculated by adding the RGB values together as vectors and then taking the length of the resulting vector:<br><br>
The wash performance (P) of the variants was calculated in accordance with the below formula:<br>
where <br>
lnt(v) is the light intensity value of textile surface washed with enzyme variant and<br>
lnt(r) is the light intensity value of textile surface washed with the reference enzyme subtiJisin<br>
