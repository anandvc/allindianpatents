COMPLETE SPECIFICATION <br>
             (See Section 10, and rule 13)<br>
1.	TITLE OF INVENTION<br>
WORKSTATION FOR A TEXTILE MACHINE PRODUCING CROSS-WOUND BOBBINS<br>
2.	APPLICANT(S)<br>
a)	Name        : OERLIKON TEXTILE GMBH &amp; CO. KG<br>
b)	Nationality : GERMAN Company<br>
c)	Address     : LANDGRAFENSTRASSE-4 5,<br>
D-410 6 9 MOENCHENGLADBACH, GERMANY<br>
3.	PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed : -<br><br>
Description<br>
The invention relates to a workstation for a textile machine producing cross-wound bobbins with a winding head housing according to the preamble of claim 1.<br>
The workstations of textile machines producing cross-wound bobbins, in particular automatic cross-winding machines, generally have a winding head housing, in each case, which inter alia has bearing arrangements for a winding drive which can be fixed in or on the winding head housing for rotating a bobbin, and for a creel, in which the bobbin can be freely rotatably mounted.<br>
Winding head housings of this type, described, for example, in DE 102 06 288 Al, also have connection devices, in each case, for fastening a component carrier, which is in turn equipped with all the electric and electronic control and supply elements necessary for proper operation of the various drives of the workstation.<br>
Workstations configured in this manner have in principle been successful in practice and are used in large numbers in the textile industry. However, it has proven to be disadvantageous in these workstations that modifications to the workstations, in particular changes in the region of the drives, generally immediately require a modification to the component carrier. In other words, the previous component carriers generally have to be exchanged completely for new component carriers when there are changes in the region of the drives or the sensor system and control.<br>
An exchange of the entire component carrier is usually also necessary when there is a fault at one of the numerous electric and electronic control and supply elements arranged on the component carrier.<br>
Proceeding from the aforementioned prior art, the invention is based on the object of<br>
providing workstations for textile machines producing cross-wound bobbins, in<br><br><br>
which a component carrier arranged in the winding head housing is configured in such a way that its control and supply elements can be adapted without problems and economically, if necessary, to drive and control changes in the region of the workstations.<br>
This object is achieved according to the invention by a workstation of a textile machine producing cross-wound bobbins, which has the features described in claim 1.<br>
Advantageous embodiments of the invention are the subject of the sub-claims.<br>
The configuration of a workstation according to the invention with a component carrier which is arranged in a winding head housing and has a plurality of insertion or fitting devices in which carrier cards can be fixed, which in each case only have a part of the electric or electronic control and supply elements of a workstation, has the advantage that with a configuration of this type, at any time, there can be a flexible and economic reaction to drive or control changes in the region of the workstations by means of a simple exchange of the relevant carrier card. The carrier cards, in this case, can be exchanged individually and, if necessary, for example when there are changes in the region of the stepping motors, are exchanged for carrier cards, the equipment of which corresponds to the new requirements.<br>
The carrier cards, which are not affected by the above-described, preferably drive or control change, for example the carrier card, which has the network part of the workstation, or the carrier card, which is equipped with the end stage for the drive of the bobbin drive roller, remain unchanged in the component carrier.<br>
As described in claim 2, it is provided in an advantageous embodiment that each of<br>
the insertion devices of the component carrier has at least two guide rails arranged<br>
in an opposing manner for mounting a carrier card and a device for energy and<br><br><br>
signal transmission. In connection with corresponding contact elements on the carrier cards, a configuration of this type ensures that an inserted carrier card is positioned according to instructions in the component carrier, and is also reliably connected to the energy supply and its associated functional unit, for example a stepping motor. The carrier cards which can be fixed in the insertion devices of the component carrier in this case, are differently equipped depending on the respective purpose of use.<br>
As shown in claim 3, the insertion devices of the component carrier are preferably equipped, in each case, with a contact device, which corresponds, when the carrier card is fitted, with corresponding contacts on the carrier card. The contact devices installed on the component carrier in each case allow a problem-free connection, appropriate to the function, of the relevant carrier card.<br>
According to claim 4, some of the carrier cards are, in each case, equipped with a control circuit, for example, for defined operation of an electric drive of the workstation. In other words, the control circuits contained on these carrier cards are specially matched, in each case, to a certain drive or its predeterminable working behaviour. With a configuration of this type of the carrier cards, if, at the workstations, changes with regard to the electric drives or changes with regard to the working behaviour of the electric drives, become necessary, these changes can easily be taken into account in that only the associated carrier card is exchanged, in other words, is replaced with a new carrier card with a correspondingly reworked control circuit.<br>
The electric drives, in this case, as described in claim 5, are preferably configured as stepping motors. Such stepping motors are proven mass production components, which can be activated in a relative manner.<br><br><br>
The above statements with regard to easy exchangeability substantially also relate to the carrier cards described in claim 6, which are configured as computer cards. These carrier cards can, if necessary, in other words if the operating conditions have changed in the region of the workstations, also be exchanged without problems for new computer cards.<br>
As described in claim 7, at least the carrier cards which contain the control circuits for the electric drives, can be easily detachably fixed by means of a clip closure in the relevant insertion devices of the component carrier. In other words, these carrier cards can be exchanged without problems and rapidly if necessary, even without the use of a tool.<br>
As shown in claims 8 or 9, carrier cards are also present, which are equipped with a network part for the electrical supply of the workstation, as well as carrier cards which have the end stage for the electric drive of the bobbin drive roller.<br>
These carrier cards are preferably fixed for safety reasons, as stated in claim 10, via screw connections in corresponding insertion devices of the component carrier. In this case, the screw connections ensure, at all times and under all conditions, an exact, reliable positioning of these carrier cards, the supply elements of which, as already mentioned above, are loaded with electrical energy during operation of the workstations.<br>
As stated in claim 11, the insertion or fitting devices of the component carrier are also characterised according to the function of the carrier cards to be inserted in an advantageous embodiment. In this manner, in particular in the case of carrier cards which are equipped with the control circuits for the stepping motors, the risk of confusion can be minimised.<br><br><br>
The invention will be described in more detail below with the aid of an embodiment shown in the drawings, in which:<br>
Fig. 1 shows a workstation of an automatic cross-winding machine in a side view, with a winding head housing, in which the component carrier configured according to the invention is integrated,<br>
Fig. 2 schematically shows a perspective view of a winding head housing, with the various drives which are arranged inside the winding head housing and can be activated in a defined manner,<br>
Fig. 3 shows a side view of an opened winding head housing with the component carrier fixed in the winding head housing,<br>
Fig. 4 shows the component carrier with exchangeable carrier cards arranged in corresponding insertion devices of the component carrier.<br>
Fig. 1 schematically shows a side view of a textile machine producing cross-wound bobbins denoted as a whole with the reference numeral 1, in the embodiment an automatic cross-winding machine. As known, automatic cross-winding machines of this type have a plurality of similar workstations 2 between their end frames (not shown). On these workstations 2 also designated winding heads, spinning cops 9, which have been produced on a ring spinning machine (not shown), are rewound to form large-volume cross-wound bobbins 15, which after their completion, are transferred by means of an automatically operating service unit to a cross-wound bobbin transporting device 21 along the length of the machine.<br>
In the embodiment, the automatic cross-winding machine 1 also has a logistics device particular to the machine in the form of a cop and tube transporting system 3. In this cop and tube transporting system 3, of which only the cop supply section 4,<br><br>
the reversibly drivable storage section 5, one of the transverse transporting sections 6 leading to the winding heads 2 and the tube return section 7 are shown in Fig. 1, spinning cops 9 or empty tubes, positioned in a vertical orientation, revolve on transporting plates 8.<br>
The delivered spinning cops 9, in this case, are rewound to form large-volume cross-wound bobbins 15 in the unwinding position AS, which in each case is located in the region of the transverse transporting sections 6. The individual winding heads 2, for this purpose, as known and therefore only indicated, have various devices, which ensure proper operation of these workstations. The devices are, for example, a suction nozzle 12, which is moveably mounted about a pivot axis 16, can be pivoted by means of a stepping motor 29 and can be acted upon by reduced pressure, a gripper tube 11 which can be moved about a pivot axis 13, can preferably also be driven by a stepping motor and can be acted upon by reduced pressure, as well as a pneumatic thread splicing mechanism 10. The pneumatic thread splicing mechanism 10 is, as indicated in Fig. 1, in this case, slightly set back with respect to the regular thread course and fixed with its central housing on the winding head housing 33.<br>
Furthermore, the winding head housing 33 has a winding mechanism which is denoted as a whole by the reference numeral 24 and which in turn has a creel 28 which is mounted so as to be moveable to a limited extent about a pivot axis 17, and a bobbin drive roller 14.<br>
As indicated in Fig. 1, the thread 18 which is unwound from the spinning cop 9 is<br>
wound onto the cross-wound bobbin 15 rotating in the rotational direction R and<br>
acted upon by the bobbin drive roller 14, and is simultaneously traversed in the<br>
process. The thread traversing in this case takes place by means of the bobbin drive<br>
roller 14, which, as can be seen from Fig. 2, is equipped with so-called thread guide<br>
grooves 19. The bobbin drive roller 14 is connected to a reversible electric motor 20,<br><br><br>
which is arranged in the winding head housing 33 and is supplied with electric energy via a so-called end stage 55. The winding mechanism 24 is also equipped, as known per se, with a creel unloading and loading device 26 as well as with an edge displacement device 23. As described in relative detail in DE 100 20 664 Al, the edge displacement device 23 has an eccentric disc which can preferably be driven by means of a stepping motor 25 and which is connected via a lever system to the axially displaceably mounted shaft of the bobbin drive roller 14. A further stepping motor 27 is provided as the drive for the creel unloading device 26 which is also arranged inside the winding head housing 33 and can be adjusted in a defined manner.<br>
The aforementioned drives are connected to electric or electronic control and supply elements, which are arranged on carrier cards 44-47,49,54,55, 57, which are fixed, so as to be individually exchangeable, in insertion or fitting devices 40-43, 48, 50, 51, 56 of a component carrier 30.<br>
In this case, the component carrier 30 is in turn, as shown for example in Fig. 3, fixed inside the winding head housing 33 on receivers. In other words, the component carrier 30 is fastened by screw bolts 60 to the rear of the winding head housing 33. The component carrier 30 is also, in this case, and this is not shown in the drawings, connected by a corresponding energy line to the energy supply and preferably by a bus connection to a central control unit of the automatic cross winding machine 1.<br>
As can be seen, in particular, from Figs 3 and 4, the component carrier 30 has various insertion devices, in which carrier cards can be positioned. For example, insertion devices 40-43 for carrier cards 44-47 are present, in other words, for carrier cards, which are equipped in each case with a control circuit, in particular for stepping motors 25, 27, 29 etc.<br><br><br>
A carrier card, which is configured as a computer card 49, can also be fixed in a receiver 48 of the component carrier 30.<br>
As can be seen in particular from Fig.3, the insertion devices 40-43, 50, 51, 56 in each case have two lateral guide rails 31 as well as contact devices 34 preferably arranged at the rear. The carrier cards 44-47, when fitted, are connected by means of corresponding contact elements arranged on the carrier cards to the contact devices 34 of the insertion devices 40-43 and, in this case, preferably easily detachably secured by a clip closure or the like. Apart from a receiver 48 in which the computer card 49 can be positioned, and which therefore also has corresponding contact devices 34, the component carrier 30 also has insertion devices 50, 51, 56 for receiving further carrier cards 54, 55, 57. The carrier card 54 is in this case equipped with a network part, in other words, this carrier card is equipped with a transformer and associated circuit regulators. The carrier card 55 preferably has the end stage for the electromotive drive 20 of the bobbin drive roller 14, in other words, this carrier card inter alia has a converter.<br>
The carrier card 57 is equipped, for example, with the control for the creel unloading and loading device 26. The carrier cards 54, 55, 57 can also be fixed in corresponding insertion devices denoted by 50, 51 or 56, which, like the insertion devices 40-43, have lateral guide rails 31 and contact devices 34. For safety reasons, the carrier cards 54, 55 loaded with electric energy are preferably specially secured, in this case, by screw bolts 36, in the insertion devices 50,51.<br><br><br>
