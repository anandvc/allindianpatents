				<td>Coloured particles for electrophoretic displays<br>
The present invention relates to the use of specifically functionalized particles as electrophoretic displaying particles, to electrophoretic dispersions comprising the functionalized particles, electrophoretic displays comprising the functionalized particles, as well as to the novel functionalized particles.<br>
Electrophoretic displays generally comprise an electric double layer produced in an Interface between a solid (charged particle) and a liquid (dispersion medium), in which a charged particle migrates to an electrode having polarity opposite to the charge possessed by the charged particle by using, as motive power, the force exerted by an electric field.<br>
It is of importance for electrophoretic displays, especially for electronic paper, that, once some contents are displayed, the display can be retained for a longer period of time even though a voltage is no longer applied.<br>
The present invention provides charged particles which can be used for such displays and which enable to cover the full colour range.<br>
Today's state of the art concerning electronic paper is the already existing black and white electronic paper as a display using electronic inks. Electronic ink is a material that is processed into a film for integration into electronic displays. The principal components of electronic inks are millions of tiny microcapsules, about the diameter of a human hair. In one embodiment, each microcapsule contains positively charged white particles and negatively charged black particles suspended in a clear fluid. When a negative voltage (field) is applied at the top electrode, the white particles move to the top of the microcapsule where they become visible to the user This makes the surface appear white at that spot. At the same time, an opposite positive voltage pulls the black negatively charged particles to the bottom of the microcapsules where they are hidden. By reversing this process, the black particles appear at the top of the capsule, which now makes the surface appear dark at that spot. With this approach an image or a text can be visualized on displays surfaces. The disadvantage is that today's technology mainly only produces black and white displays.<br><br>
To come up with a coloured electronic paper display, it is a requirement to have coloured particles (green, blue, red or magenta, yellow, cyan) of appropriate size and homodispersity, which can be guided by electrophoretic movements like the black and white particles as described above, when sandwiched in between a positive and negative electrode.<br>
The subject matter of the present invention is based on the idea to use silica or alumina nano-, sub-micro- or microparticles surface modified with at least a chemically bonded dye, if additionally required a chemically bonded anionic or cationic group and, if required to make them compatible to the organic solvent, a compatibilizer group. With this approach and by using different coloured dyes, it is possible to synthesize rather homodisperse particles with any colour needed, with a wide range of zeta potential, and which are stable in dispersions. As the particle size is easy to tune in a narrow particle size distribution, it is possible to produce transparent as well as opaque coloured particles. This is important as for different display approaches either transparent or opaque coloured particles could be needed.<br>
The present invention therefore relates to the use of functionalized particles as electrophoretic displaying particles, wherein<br>
the functionalized particles are SiO2, AI2O3 or mixed SiO2 and AI2O3 particles comprising, covalently bound to an oxygen atom on the surface, a radical of formula<br><br>
wherein<br>
R1 and R2 are independently of each other hydrogen, particle surface-0-, or a substituent,<br>
nis1.2,3,4,5,6,7or8.<br>
B is the direct bond or a bridge member, and<br>
D is the residue of an organic chromopho	re.<br>
The functionalized particles comprising a covalently bound radical of formula (1) should carry a positive or negative charge. It is preferred that the particles comprise a cationic ammonium or phosphonium group or an anionic carboxy, sulfate, sulfonate or phosphato group.<br><br>
Examples of cationic ammonium groups are those of the formula -N(R1*)3, wherein the three radicals R1* can have the same or different meanings, and R1* is hydrogen; C1-C12alkyl which can be interrupted by -O- and can be substituted by hydroxyl or phenyl, and wherein the phenyl radical can be further substituted by C1-C8alkyl, C1-C8alkoxy or halogen; or phenyl which can be substituted by C1-C8alkyl, CrCaalkoxy or halogen. It is preferred that R1 is hydrogen or C1-C12alkyl, especially C1-C12alkyl.<br>

Preferred anionic groups are carboxy. sulfate or sulfonato, especially carboxy or sulfonate.<br>
In the context of the present invention it is to be understood that the cationic and anionic groups can also comprise the corresponding counterions.<br>
For example, cationic groups may also comprise corresponding anionic counterions. Anionic counterions denote, for example, an organic or inorganic anion, such as halide, preferably chloride and fluoride, sulfate, hydrogen sulfate, phosphate, phosphorus hexafluoride, boron tetrafluoride. boron tetraphenyl, carbonate, bicarbonate, oxalate or Ci-Cealkyl sulfate, especially methyl sulfate or ethyl sulfate; anionic counterion also denotes lactate, formate, acetate, propionate or a complex anion, such as the zinc chloride double salt. The anionic counterion is especially a halide, preferably chloride or fluoride, sulfate, hydrogen sulfate, methyl sulfate, ethyl sulfate, phosphate, formate, acetate or lactate. The anionic counterion is more especially fluoride, chloride, methyl sulfate, ethyl sulfate, formate or acetate.<br>
Furthermore, anionic groups may also comprise cationic counterions, like those of the formulae N(R2')4*, P(R3')4* or alkali metal ions, wherein the four radicals R2' as well as the four radicals R3* can have the same or different meanings. As to R2' and R3' the definitions and preferences given above for R1* apply. Examples of alkali metal ions are lithium, sodium, potassium and cesium.<br><br><br>

For such electrophoretic dispersions it is of importance that no settlement of the particles takes place. Therefore, it is preferred that the functionalized particles comprise, in addition to<br><br>

3 Electrophoretic display systems including electrophoretic devices are known (see for example US-B-5,914,806. US-A-2004/0094422. WO-A-02/079869). The electrophoretic display systems usually comprise a plurality of such electrophoretic devices.<br>
The electrophoretic display system includes the electrophoretic devices each including a pair of substrates and an electrophoretic dispersion placed between the substrates, wherein at least one of the substrates comprises a transparent material, the substrates have a predetermined distance therebetween, and the electrophoretic dispersion contains at least a liquid dispersion medium and electrophoretic particles having a surface charge. When a<br><br>
voltage is applied between the substrates, the electrophoretic particles electrophoretically migrate depending on the surface charge and the direction of the electric field, thereby changing the distribution of the electrophoretic particles. Therefore, the colour of the electrophoretic device is changed when viewed from the transparent substrate side. Namely, when the charged particles move to one of the substrates, which serves as a display surface, the color possessed by the charged particles is recognized. Thus, a desired image can be displayed by controlling the voltage being applied.<br>
It is preferred that some display devices contain red particles, some display devices contain green particles and some display devices contain blue particles. According to another embodiment it is preferred that some display devices contain cyan particles, some display devices contain magenta particles and some display devices contain yellow particles. By addressing the display devices individually, a display can be caused to give an appearance corresponding to a selected colour at a selected brightness level.<br>
Interesting types of electrophoretic displays are the so-called microceli electrophoretic displays. In microceli electrophoretic displays the particle containing dispersion medium is retained in a plurality of cavities formed within a carrier medium (see for example WO-A-02/01281).<br>
A preferred electrophoretic display is electronic paper. This is typically a sheet-like display comprising a sheet-like display function layer.<br>
