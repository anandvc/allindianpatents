				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a fluid spray device comprising a reservoir containing fluid<br>
which the actuation force exerted by the user is directed<br>
in a direction that is different from the direction in which the fluid is sprayed through the spray orifice of the device.<br>
Most fluid dispenser devices, whether they be perfume, medicine, or cosmetic dispensers, are made in such a manner that the user, when wishing to dispense a dose of fluid, exerts a force either on the dispenser head, or on the fluid reservoir, the force being directed axially in the displacement direction of the piston or of the valve of the device.  That type of actuation is very practical for any device in which the spray direction is not axial, i.e. is not parallel to the displacement direction of the piston of the pump or the valve member of the valve of the device.  In contrast, for a nasal spray in which the' fluid is dispensed axially in order to project the dose of fluid into the nostril, that type of spray presents a certain number of drawbacks.<br>
Thus, in particular, the fact that the force for actuating the device must be exerted in an axial direction implies that it is difficult to hold the nasal endpiece still inside the nostril while dispensing.  In addition, that type of actuation can require a certain amount of force to overcome the precompression of the pump or of the valve, which can present difficulties for certain people such as the elderly or children, and which can, in extreme cases, also lead to injury to the inside of the nostril.  In addition, that type of device is relatively difficult to actuate by a third person who is unable to sense contact of the nasal endpiece inside the nostril.<br>
Document US-3 272 391 discloses a device in which an external ring is assembled around the fixing element, specifically a clamping ring that is clamped onto the neck of the receptacle.  Two laterally-actuated elements co-operate with said external ring in order to actuate the dispenser valve.<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide a fluid spray device which does not reproduce the above-mentioned drawbacks.<br>
In particular, an object of the present invention is to provide a fluid spray device which is simple and inexpensive to manufacture and to assemble, and which can be adapted to any type of presently-available pump or valve, without needing to modify the design of the pump or the valve.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide such a fluid spray device which is simple to actuate, in particular in a nasal application.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide such a fluid spray device which enables the dispenser orifice of the device to be held still inside the nostril while the device is being actuated.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide such a device which limits the number of component parts, and which does not need an add-on element in order to actuate it.<br>
The present invention therefore provides a fluid spray device comprising a reservoir containing fluid; a pump or a valve mounted on the reservoir by means of a fixing ring for selectively dispensing the fluid; and a dispenser head including a dispenser orifice, the device further comprising an actuator device that is displaceable between a rest position and a dispensing position, the actuator device being displaced in a direction that is different from the direction in which the fluid is sprayed through the dispenser orifice, said fluid spray device being characterized in that said actuator device is formed on the dispenser head, and cooperates with the fixing ring in order to actuate the pump or the valve.<br>
Said dispenser head advantageously includes a lateral skirt, said actuator device being formed in said lateral skirt.<br>
In a first embodiment of the present invention, said actuator device includes at least one actuator element pivotally mounted on said dispenser head, and including an actuator portion co-operating with said fixing ring.<br>
Each actuator element advantageously includes a presser element on which the user exerts an actuation force, said presser element being connected to said actuator portion of the actuator element via a connection spacer.<br>
Said actuator device advantageously includes two actuator elements that are diametrally opposite about said dispenser head.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, the actuator device is made in the form of one or more buttons co-operating with said fixing ring, said buttons being displaceable in a direction that is approximately perpendicular to the displacement direction of the actuator rod of the pump or of the valve member of the valve.<br>
The fixing ring advantageously includes an oblique cam element co-operating with the bottom end of the lateral skirt of the dispenser head, so that displacement of said skirt transversely to the direction in which the fluid is sprayed is transformed by said oblique cam element into displacement in the direction in which the fluid is sprayed.<br>
The cam element is advantageously provided at the end of the actuating stroke of the dispenser head.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, said actuator device includes an actuator element pivotally mounted on said head, said actuator element co-operating with an intermediate piece connected firstly to said head, and secondly to said ring, said intermediate piece<br>
being deformable so that said ring can be displaced axially relative to said head during actuation.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention, said actuator device includes at least one actuator element slidably mounted to slide along the lateral skirt of the dispenser head.<br>
The actuator device advantageously includes a precompression element, so that the pump or the valve is actuated only when the precompression threshold is overcome by the user.<br>
The dispenser head is advantageously a nasal dispenser head, which, during actuation of the pump or the valve, remains steady in position in the user's nostril.<br>
Other characteristics and advantages of the present invention appear more clearly from the following detailed description of several embodiments of the present invention, given by way of non-limiting example, and with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:<br>
Figure 1 is a diagrammatic section view of a device constituting a first embodiment of the present invention;<br>
Figure 2 is a diagrammatic section view of a device constituting a second embodiment of the present invention;<br>
Figure 3a and 3b are diagrammatic views of a device constituting a third embodiment of the present invention; and<br>
Figure 4 is a diagrammatic section view of a device constituting a fourth embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Figures 1, 2, and 4 are slightly more detailed views of two variant embodiments of the present invention, while Figures 3a and 3b are very diagrammatic views which show a different embodiment of the actuator device, without showing the rest of the device in detail.<br>
With reference to the figures, and in particular with reference to Figure 1, the spray device of the<br>
invention comprises a reservoir 10 which contains the fluid to be dispensed, and a pump or a valve 20, in this case a pump in Figure 1 which is mounted on the reservoir 10 by means of a fixing ring 30, which, in this example, is a snap-on ring that is snap-fastened onto the neck of the reservoir.  The pump 20 serves to dispense the fluid selectively through a dispenser orifice 45 provided in a dispenser head 40.  In this example, as in the examples shown in the other figures, the dispenser head 40 is a nasal dispenser head, in which the orifice 45 is disposed in axial manner in order to dispense the fluid inside the nostril.<br>
Naturally, the present invention is not necessarily limited to a nasal application, but applies to any type of fluid dispenser device.  Its use in a nasal-type dispenser device does however present the above-mentioned advantages.<br>
In the invention, the spray device includes an actuator system 50 which is formed on the dispenser head 40, the displacement direction of the actuator device 50 being different from the direction in which the fluid is sprayed through the dispenser orifice 45.  More specifically, in the examples shown in the figures, the displacement direction of the actuator device 50 is advantageously approximately perpendicular to the direction in which the fluid is sprayed through the dispenser orifice 45, it being understood that as a function of the embodiment selected for the actuator device, and in particular when it is a pivoting element, said direction is not always exactly perpendicular.<br>
In the example shown in Figure 1, the actuator system 50 includes at least one actuator element 51 pivotally mounted on the dispenser head 40.  The dispenser head 40 preferably includes a lateral skirt 41 provided with two diametrally opposite actuator elements 51.<br>
In the invention, the actuator elements 51 acts directly on the fixing ring 30 of the pump 20 on the reservoir 10 in order to actuate said pump or valve.  The user therefore places the dispenser head 40 in a nostril, and actuates the elements 51 in order to dispense a dose of fluid, said actuation being performed laterally so that the device remains stationary inside the nostril while dispensing, with no axial force being exerted on the device.  The actuator elements 51 are pivotally mounted on the dispenser head 40, each actuator element 51 including an actuator portion 52 which co-operates with the fixing ring 30.  Each actuator element 51 advantageously includes a presser element 54 on which the user presses in order to actuate the device.  The presser element 54 is preferably connected to the actuator portion 52 of the actuator element 51 via a connection spacer 53 that is preferably rigid.  When the user presses on the presser elements 54, force is transmitted directly to the actuator portions 52, and therefore to the fixing ring 30, via said spacers 53.  The pivoting of the actuator element 51 about its pivot axis A causes the axial displacement of said fixing ring 30, and therefore the actuation of the pump 20.  Another pivot axis could optionally be provided, e.g. between the actuator element 51 and the presser element 54, or even between the presser element 54 and the connection spacer 53.  The actuator element 51 and the presser element 54 can thus be made integrally as a single piece.<br>
Advantageously, a precompression element can be provided which enables the pump or the valve 20 to be actuated only when the precompression threshold is overcome by the user.  This ensures that the entire dose is dispensed, and prevents the device from being partially actuated.<br>
Figure 4 shows another embodiment, in which the actuator device includes an actuator element 51 and a movable intermediate piece 58.  The actuator element 51<br>
is pivotally mounted on the head 40 about its pivot axis A.  It co-operates with the intermediate piece 58, referred to as an "angled part" comprising two branches, one of which is connected to the head 40 (which in this case extends laterally along the reservoir 10) , and the other is connected directly to the fixing ring 30.  The angled part 58 is also deformable about a pivot axis B so that when the user presses laterally on the actuator element 51, the angled part 58 deforms, with the two branches pivoting about the axis B, thereby causing the ring 30, and thus also the reservoir 10, to move axially, and causing the pump 20 to be actuated.<br>
In the example in Figures 3a and 3b, the actuator device 50 is made in the form of buttons 56 that are laterally displaceable, said displacement actuating the pump or the valve 20.  More precisely, in the example in Figure 3a, a rod 57 is pivotally connected to the actuator buttons 56, said rod 57 being guided by an oblique/sloping surface, so that actuation of the buttons 56 causes said rod to move vertically upwards in order to actuate the pump, the end of said rod being fixed, or cooperating with the fixing ring 30 of the device.<br>
Figure 2 shows another embodiment of the invention, in which the actuator system is formed by the lateral skirt 41 of the dispenser head 40.  As shown in Figure 2, said fixing ring 30 advantageously includes an oblique cam element 31 which co-operates with the bottom end 50 of the lateral skirt 41 of the dispenser head 40, so that displacement of said skirt 41 transversely to the direction in which the fluid is sprayed is transformed by the oblique cam element 31 into displacement in the direction in which the fluid is sprayed.  In the device in Figure 2, the actuator rod of the pump 20 is displaced by actuating the dispenser head 40.  It is thus advantageous for the cam element 31 of the fixing ring 30 to co-operate with the bottom end 50 of the lateral skirt<br>
41 of the dispenser head 40 at the end of the actuating stroke of said dispenser head 40.<br>
A particular advantage of a laterally-actuated system that is formed on the head, and that does not cooperate directly with the tank, is that it can be adapted to any type, shape, and size of reservoir.  It is not necessary to design a specific actuator system for each reservoir.<br>
Naturally all the embodiments are described and shown only in very diagrammatic manner, and other variants could be used to implement the actuator system of the present invention.  The invention is therefore not limited to the embodiments shown in the drawings, and the person skilled in the art can carry out any necessary modifications without going beyond the ambit of the invention as defined by the accompanying claims.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
