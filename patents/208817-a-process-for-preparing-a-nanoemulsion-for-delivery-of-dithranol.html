This invention relates to a process for preparing a nanoemulsion for delivery of dithranol.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Dithranol (1,8,9-trihydroxyanthracene) is used in the topical treatment of psoriasis, eczemas, dermatophytoses, alopecia areata and other dermatological diseases. It suffers however from some serious disadvantages.<br>
It is highly irritant to skin not affected by psoriasis and most therefore be applied with considerably care and often limits the time of exposure of such preparations to the skin. Currently in clinical practice the preparations are to be applied on the skin for short period of and to be removed after 30 minutes of application otherwise it  becomes  very   difficult to tolerate    the skin irritation.<br>
It is easily oxidized to brown or black products and has a powerful staining on clothing &amp; normal skin. Commercially in European countries it is known that, dithranol is mixed with ointment base and compounded  by  the pharmacist in the pharmacy and given to<br>
2<br><br>
the patient for immediate use. Also British Pharmacopoeia 2001, volume II, page 2035 states that Dithranol Cream should be stored at a room temperature  not exceeding  25°C.<br>
It is very difficult to deliver dithranol in soluble form in the concentration ranging above 0.15% and it is the soluble form of the dithranol, which is more effective than dispersed or suspended dithranol.<br>
There is a need to have the dithranol compositions, which will be free of above undesirable effects, and those can be applied to the skin for a prolonged period of time to achieve bettter therapeutic effect in the treatment of psoriasis. Also such preparations should be stable   on prolonged    storage.<br>
There have been a    number of references   in the literature to compositions containing dithranol. Such as Ointments (petroleum base). Creams with either o/w   or w/o emulsion<br>
3<br><br>
Liposomes &amp; Niosomes formulations (Commercially not available).<br>
Solid lipid nanoparticles (Commercially not available).<br>
However they have their own limitations one of the other with respect to stability, efficiency, irritation potential &amp; staining causing by dithranol. One of the major limitation is the low level of dithranol in soluble form and often requires dispersion of dithranol in powder form to achieve dithranol concentration above 0.75% in the product.<br>
Laugier; Jean Pierre et al. in US Patent No 5358716 described oil in water emulsion containing dithranol and nonionic vesicles prepared for nonionic amphilic lipids, in order to prevent the oxidation of the dithranol. Vesicles are dispersed in the aqueous phase of the emulsion. However, dithranol is not encapsulated in the vesicles and the o/w emulsion compositions with dithranol content greater than 0.15% are present as micronised dithranol in dispersed form and not in solution form.   It is not possible to incorporate   dithranol<br>
4<br><br>
in solution   form above 0.15% concentration in such preparations  due to limitation of dithranol solubility in oil and lipid phase.<br>
Shyamal, C et al., Journal of Pharmaceutical Science Vol. 85, No 10, October 1996, 1082- 1084; described the topical delivery of Erythromycin from Liposomal emulsion. A nonionic liposomal formulation containing glyceryl dilaurate, cholesterol, polyoxyethylene-10-stearyl ether at weight ratio of 57:15:28 prepared by melting the lipid phase containing Erythromycin base at 60°C followed by hydration with buffer solution. This liposomal dispersion was mixed with mineral oil or isopropyl palmitate and sonicated to yield mixture of emulsion with liposomes. They showed maximum stability for 2 weeks for such formulations. It is known in the art that any active ingredient / drug present in solution form when applied topically, diffuses more rapidly through the skin as compared to dispersed solid particular drug. It can very well be demonstrated by universal Fick's law of diffusion. It was an object of the invention to overcome the above-mentioned limitations and to formulate efficient and stable delivery system containing dithranol alone or in combination with salicylic acid and coal tar extract for effective and rapid control of psoriasis.<br>
5<br><br>
SUMMARY OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a mixed vesicular system for the topical delivery of dithranol alone or in combination with salicylic acid which mimics noisomes and liposomes. This system, if desired, can also contain vacuum dried coal tar extract. The mixed vesicular system is composed of a nanoemulsion with bilayer nanovesicles, wherein dithranol and, if present, salicylic acid are entrapped in the vesicles. This is achieved through the use in this system of a nonionic oily liquid lipid material capable of solubilizing dithranol itself or in combination with salicylic acid. The mixed vesicular system has particle size of no greater than 450 nm and can be stored at room temperature for extended periods of time. Furthermore, the composition of this invention does not produce irritation or staining and is very effective for the treatment of psoriasis.<br>
It is known that any active ingredient / drug present in solution form diffuses rapidly through the skin as compared to solid dispersed particulate drug. The composition of this invention provides a topical pharmaceutical compositions   containing   dithranol in soluble<br>
6<br><br>
form even at higher drug concentrations so as to make it more effective. In this manner, the active ingredients can penetrate into and through the skin so that the active ingredients are provided continuously and in sufficient quantity at the site of action. The topical compositions of this invention can be used for the topical treatment of psoriasis, eczemas, dermatophytoses, alopecia areata and other dermatological diseases. In addition, this invention provides a topical composition which is stable at 37°C to 45°C for more than six months thus making it readily dispensable and able to be stored at room temperature in tropical countries.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
In accordance with this invention, dithranol is applied topically to the skin in a water and oil nanoemulsion with contains a plurality of bilayer vesicles dispersed therein with the vesicles having a particle size of no greater than 450 nm. These bilayer vesicles are formed with one layer being a lipid phase and the other being an aqueous phase with the lipid phase containing dithranol solubilized in a non-ionic oily liquid lipid material which forms the lipid phase. In accordance with this invention, the composition can contain either   dithranol or a<br>
7<br><br>
mixture of dithranol with salicylic acid solubilized in the lipid phase. In accordance with this invention either dithranol alone or with salicylic acid can form the active ingredient in the topical treatment of dermatological diseases such as psoriasis, etc. In accordance with this invention, the dithranol present in the system in concentrations as high as 1.0% by weight of said composition can be completely solubilized in this composition. In general, these compositions contain dithranol in an amount ranging from about 0.1% to about 1% by weight based upon the weight of the composition. If it is desired to incorporate salicylic acid in the composition, the salicylic acid is present in combination with dithranol in an amount of from about 0.1% to about 3% by weight based upon the weight of the composition and preferably from about 0.5% to about 1.5% by weight based upon the weight of said composition. If salicylic acid is present in combination with dithranol, this combination is entrapped in the lipid phase ofthebilayer vesicles within the nanoemulsion.<br>
Solubilization is important since Dithranol is insoluble in water and sparingly soluble in hydrocarbon basis, vegetable oils and esters of fatty acids; limiting its   concentration   below 0.1% insoluble<br>
8<br><br>
form. It has been very difficult to formulate preparations containing dithranol above 0.1% w/w concentration in soluble form. Surprisingly, it has been found that dithranol and combinations of dithranol and salicylic acid can be solubilized in non-ionic liquid lipid materials such as tocopherol acetate (Vitamin E acetate) which can be used as a vehicle to keep the dithranol in solution in stable form even at high concentrations.<br>
In accordance with the present invention it is discovered that by using a non-ionic oily liquid lipid material which acts as a solubilizer for dithranol, such as a-tocopherol acetate, the dithranol and combinations of dithranol and salicylic acid will be kept in solution entrapped in the vesicles in this oily lipid material which forms the oily phase in both the nanoemulsion and the bilayer vesicles. Any conventional in non-ionic liquid lipid materials, suitable for topical administration, which will solubilize dithranol, can be utilized in formulating the oily lipid phases of this system. Among the preferred non-ionic oily liquid lipid materials are included tocopherol acetate and Arlamol E® (Polyoxypropylene-15-stearyl ether) or mixtures thereof   with     tocopherol acetate   being     especially     preferred.     In<br>
9<br><br>
formulating the system of this invention, the non-ionic oily liquid lipid material can be generally present in an amount of from about 3% to 40% by weight based upon the weight of the composition, with amounts of from about 5% to 30% by weight based upon the weight of the composition being especially preferred.<br>
The system of this invention achieves enhanced encapsulation of dithranol in solubilized state. Furthermore the composition of the invention surprisingly has been found to be free of undesirable side effects, and provides excellent therapeutic effects in psoriasis, eczemas, dermatophytoses, alopecia areata and other skin disorders when it is administered topically. In clinical tests it has been found that the system of this invention due to the presence of micro-emulsion with mixed vesicles provides effective delivery of dithranol. These advantages     are in some part due to -<br>
Presence   of nanoemulsion instead of emulsion.<br>
Presence of combination of micro-emulsion with mixed vesicles.<br>
Dithranol entrapment   in soluble form.<br>
Preparation   mimics liposomal and niosomal delivery system.<br>
10<br><br>
It is known that any active ingredient / drug present in solution form diffuses rapidly through the skin as compared to solid dispersed particulate drug. It is an object of the invention to make pharmaceutical compositions containing dithranol in soluble form even at higher drug concentrations so as to make it more effective, where by the active ingredient can penetrate into and through the skin so that the active ingredients are provided continuously and in sufficient quantity  at the site of action.<br>
In accordance with this invention, the composition topical administration is in the form of a homogeneous mixture of oil and water nanoemulsion that constitutes an oil lipid phase and an aqueous phase. It can be either an oil in water or water in oil emulsion in which spherical hollow bilayer vesicles like liposomes are present in the single system wherein the dithranol or the dithranol in combination with salicylic acid is present in both the oil globules of the emulsion and in the oil or lipid phase of the bilayer vesicles in a soluble state. Generally, it is preferred that the composition of this invention be a homogeneous mixture of an oil in water nanoemulsion. With the oil lipid<br>
11<br><br>
phase which is emulsified in the aqueous phase being present in an amount of from 8% to 50% by weight of the composition, preferable from about 5% to about  40% by weight  of the composition.<br>
The above mixed vesicular system of this invention which is present as a liquid, if desired, can be thickened to form a gel or cream. This can be done by adding a gelling agent which are thickening agents or viscosity modifying agent to the liquid system. Any conventional gelling agent can be utilized to convert the liquid emulsion of this invention into a cream or gel. Among the preferred gelling agents are included xanthan gum, ethylene oxide, carbopol, hydroxypropyl, methyl or cellulose. The amount of gelling agent to be added to the composition depends upon the ultimate viscosity of the gel or cream that is desired.<br>
According to the invention there is provided a process for preparing a nanoemulsion for delivery of dithranol comprising an oil and a water phases, said nanoemulsion having dispersed therein a plurality of bilayer vesicles which retain dithranol solubilized in the oily phase of the vesicles comprising:<br>
12<br><br>
a)	providing both a solution of dithranol in an amount from 0.01 to 1% by weight dissolved in a non-ionic oily liquid lipid material and an aqueous   medium;<br>
b)	mixing said oily solution with said aqueous medium to form a mixture;<br>
c)	homogenizing said mixture to form a homogeneous emulsion containing  an oily phase and an aqueous  phase;<br>
d)	subjecting said homogeneous mixture to high pressure homogenization at  pressure  of from 20,000 psi to 30,000 psi and<br>
e)	thereafter passing said high pressure homogeneous mixture through a 0.45 ran membrane to produce said oil and water nanoemulsion.<br>
In accordance with one embodiment of this invention when salicylic acid is used in combination with dithranol the salicylic acid is also retained in soluble form along dithranol in the mixed vesicular system mimicking niosomes and liposomes. It is also known in the art that pharmaceutical compositions containing dithranol are more effective   in combination with salicylic acid and alcoholic extract of coal<br>
13<br><br>
tar for the treatment of psoriasis. However such preparations are reported have some percentage of alcohol content which may be intensifying the irritation potential to the skin. In addition, if it is desired to further reduce any possible additional irritating effect of alcohol on the skin of the topical composition of this invention one can vacuum dry the alcoholic extract of coal tar and add it to the composition of this invention. This vacuum dried coal tar extract is in the form of viscous slurry. Generally in accordance with a preferred embodiment of this invention the coal tar extract is added in an amount of from abunt 0.1% to about 6.0% by weight based the weight of the composition with amounts of from about 0.25% to about 2.0% by weight being especially preferred.<br>
It is known in the art that dithranol is very sensitive to oxidative degradation and a variety of known antioxidants such as butylated hydroxyanisole, butylated hydroxytoulene, ascorbic acid, citric acid, oxalic acid, tartaric acid, succinic acid etc. can be present in the preferred composition of this invention. In the present invention, it is preferred to use antioxidants such as BHA and BHT in combination with ascorbic acid to prevent   oxidative    degradation   of dithranol.   In<br>

The vacuum dried coal tar extract according to the present invention can be prepared by first dispersing and soaking the coal tar viscous mass in the alcoholic solution of polyoxyethylene 20 sorbitan monolaurate (Tween-80) for 7 days. The extract is then filtered and alcohol is removed form the filtrate by vacuum evaporation at 35°C temperature in rotary vacuum evaporator to get vacuum dried coal tar extract. Concentration of vacuum dried coal tar extract in the mixed vesicular system according to the present invention may range from about 0.01% to about 6.0% by weight based upon the weight of the composition, preferably  from about 0.25% to about 2% by weight.<br>
This invention is directed to the process for preparing an oil and water nanoemulsion with an oil and water phase wherein the nanoemulsion has dispersed therein a plurality of bilayer vesicles retaining dithranol alone or in combination with salicylic acid solubilized in the oily layers of the   vesicles.      In  accordance    with this invention,    the<br>
19<br><br>
nanoemulsion is carried out providing a solution of dithranol dissolved in the non-ionic oily liquid lipid material as well as a separate aqueous medium which may contain such excipients as stabilizers, anti-oxidants, etc dissolved therein. The aqueous medium and the oily solution are mixed together and then homogenized to form a homogeneous emulsion which contains the oily phase and the aqueous phase. Any conventional homogenizer may be used to homogenize this emulsion mixture. This emulsion is next subjected to high pressure homogenization at pressures from about 20,000 psi to about 30,000 psi. In the final step, the homogeneous mixture after being subjected to high pressure homogenization is passed through a 0.45 nm membrane. In this manner, the oil and water nanoemulsion is produced. The oily non-ionic lipid medium such as a -tocopherol acetate prior to mixing with the aqueous phase contains dithranol or dithranol in combination with salicylic acid solubilized in said lipid phase which preferably contains a -tocopherol acetate along with other non-ionic lipids.<br>
This homogenized mixture is then passed through high pressure homogenizer   at   20,000   to   30,000 psi pressure followed   by passing<br>
20<br><br>
through 0.45 urn membrane. The resulting system was found to be<br>
mixed vesicular system comprising nanoemulsion with vesicles<br>
formed by combination of tocopherol acetate, nonionic surfactant,<br>
cholesterol and	lecithin, encapsulating    the dithranol alone or in<br>
combination with salicylic acid in soluble form. In the present invention, the oil phase composition is such that after emulsification and high pressure homogenization it forms an oil in water emulsion along with in situ formulation of bilayer vesicles composed of the non-ionic oily liquid lipid material such as a-tocopherol acetate and other non-ionic surfactants. In accordance with the method of this invention, the bilayer vesicles are formed in situ after the high pressure homogenization step and are not  added separately to the system.<br>
The composition according to the present invention having 0.5% w/w dithranol, 1.15% w/w salicylic acid and 0.58%, w/w vacuum dried coal tar extract were tested clinically on 12 patients with skin psoriasis and found to as equally effective as compared to conventional dithranol ointment containing 1.1% w/w dithranol, 1.15% w/w salicylic acid &amp; 5.3% w/w alcoholic  extract   of coal tar solution.<br>

32<br><br>
Skin involves in psoriasis is hyperplastic (thickened), erythematous (red or inflamed) and has thick adherent scales. The degree of thickening is such that lesion are elevated upto 1 mm above the surface &amp; adjacent normal skin; erythema is usually an intense red; the thickened adherent scales cause the surface of involved skin to be marked by rough &amp; uneven. These three attributes of thickness, colour &amp; texture as described in US Patent No 4287214 were quantified to allow comparative measurement of degree of improvement from topically applied therapeutic compositions - therapeutic composition of the present invention (Example 1 &amp; Example 2) and conventional dithranol ointment (Example 11).<br>
33<br><br>
Degree of Improvement<br><br>
	None (o)	mid (1+)	Moderate<br>
(2+)	Substantial (3+)	Complete (4+)<br>
Thickness	Highly elevated	Detectable reduction	Readily apparent	Barely elevated	Normal thickness<br>
Texture	Visibly rough	Palpably rough	Uneven but not rough	Slightly uneven	Visibly and<br>
palpably smooth<br>
Colour	Intense Red	Red	Dark Pink	Light Pink	Normal skin colour<br>
In order to ascertain whether the dithranol compositions of the present invention (Example 1 &amp; Example 2) are therapeutically more efficacious than conventional Dithranol Ointment (Example 11) for topical treatment of psoriasis, a total of more than 12 patients having psoriasis were tested in this study.<br>
34<br><br>
The treatment areas in patients having psoriasis were localized<br>
lesions 8-20 cm in diameter. The therapeutic compositions were<br>
topically applied by the patient in an amount sufficient to cover the<br>
treatment. Applications were made two-three times daily and<br>
without occlusive dressing. Clinical evaluation of degree of<br>
improvement were made of weekly interval. The treatment was<br>
continued for 4 weeks unless clearing of disease occurred earlier<br>
&amp; evaluation of degree improvement was made. The treatment results<br>
are summarized as follows:<br>
TABLE 1:	Effect on Psoriasis<br><br>
	Dithranol concentration	Therapeutic efficiency after<br>
		2 weeks	4 weeks<br>
Example 1	0.5% w/w	+ 3	+ 4<br>
Example 2	0.5% w/w	+ 3	+ 4<br>
Example 11	1.1% w/w	+ 2	+ 3<br>
35<br><br>
TABLE 2    :        Staining and irritation  effect  of topically  applied composition    of skin<br><br>
	Dithranol concentration	Irritation	Staining<br>
Example 1	0.5% w/w	No irritation	No staining<br>
Example 2	0.5% w/w	No irritation	No staining<br>
Example 11	1.1% w/w	High irritation observed, sometimes required for the removal from applied skin	Staining of cloth and skin observed<br>
Conclusion<br>
Therapeutic compositions   of the present invention were found to be nonirritating, non-staining   and therapeutically more effective    even at low dithranol concentration   (0.5% w/w) as compared  to conventional Dithranol Ointment containing 1.1%   w/w dithranol.<br>
