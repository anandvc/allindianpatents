				<td>The invention relates to a system of supply, discharge and distribution lines of a distribution network for, in particular, liquid operating media, such as lubricants or coolants as well as hydraulic pressure media for control members or drives, of rolling stands provided with roll housings.<br>
In the prior art of the rolling stand pipework, the supply of the hydraulic consumers conventionally was realized via two media stations.  For this purpose, valve stands were arranged<br>
on the foundation (looper),<br>
on the stage, in particular, for servo hydraulics,<br>
in the basement, in particular, for auxiliary hydraulics,<br>
on the rolling stands, preferably at several, decentralized<br>
locations.<br>
As a result of this, a large number of pipelines from the basement to the machine was required for which approximately 250 interfaces foundation/machine were needed;<br>
moreover, rigid pipe works were required, partially on the roll housing, partially on pipe pieces, which resulted occasionally in leakage of the pipe pieces or their connecting elements as a result of vibrations during operation as well as other difficult conditions;<br><br>
an always new arrangement of the pipeline resulted because of the device-specific line guiding to individual operating locations.<br>
DE G 94 08 440.8 discloses an embodiment of supply, discharge and distribution lines for, in particular, liquid operating media in machine housings formed of a closed or open support frame. The lines are in the form of longitudinal bores machined into the support frame of the machine housing.<br>
Baaed on the aforementioned prior art, it is an object of the invention to improve or newly organize a system of supply, discharge and distribution lines of a distribution network for liquid operating media of the kind mentioned in the preamble of claim 1 in order to overall reduce thereby, inter alia, the expenditure of the construction site pipework significantly, to improve the accessibility to the pipelines, to facilitate, by arranging the controls at a central location, the serviceability and control during operation, and, inter alia, to eliminate the need for hydraulic pipework in the basement.<br>
As a solution to this object, the invention proposes in a system of the pipelines of a distribution network for, in particular, liquid operating media on rolling stands of the kind mentioned in the preamble of claim 1 that all consumers of a rolling stand are connected to a high-pressure distribution network for the operating media and that supply and/or discharge lines of the distribution network are combined under formation of pipeline groups to modules that can be mounted on the rolling stand.<br><br>
Accordingly the present invention provide system of supply, discharge and distribution lines of the distribution network for, in particular, liquid operating media, such as lubricants or coolants as well as hydraulic pressure media for control members or drives, on rolling stands provided with roll housings (10,11), characterized in that<br>
-	all consumers of a rolling stand are connected to a high-pressure distribution network for the operating media, and<br>
-	that supply and/or discharge lines of the distribution network are combined with formation of pipeline groups (12, 13, 14) to modules (1-3.4) mountable on the rolling stand.<br>
With great advantage, by means of the system according to the invention of the hydraulic supply network of a rolling stand, the expenditure of the construction site pipework is reduced overall, the accessibility to the pipelines is significantly increased, and, as a result of the arrangement of the controls at a central location, the serviceability and control possibility during operation are facilitated, and the possibility is realized to completely eliminate hydraulic pipe work in the basement.<br>
One embodiment of the invention provides that the distribution network comprises pipeline groups of the following modules:<br>
-	a central control section (5) positioned in or on the media stage of the roiling stand and connected with the pipeline groups,<br>
-	a pipe array on the top side of the rolling stand,<br>
-	pipe arrays on the sidewalls of the rolling stand or the supports of the rolling stand for media inflow at the operating side,<br>
-	pipe arrays on the sidewalls of &amp;?e rolling stand or supports c^ the rdiing stand for media outflow at the operating side,<br>
-	lines for media inflow at the drive side,<br>
-	lines for media outflow at the drive side.<br>
The effects on the manufacture or mounting of the pipeline apply network of a rolling stand are significant; in particular, the following advantage result:<br>
-	reduction of formed pieces and fittings;<br>
-	reduction of bent pieces at the isometrics;<br><br>
avoidance  of manufacture of manufacture-intensive  pipe<br>
supports;<br>
reduction of all welding labor;<br>
the  modules  provide  an  advantageous  possibility  for<br>
remanufactured of pipeline sections in a work shop independent<br>
of the rolling stands;<br>
a standardization of the pipeline cross-sections is possible.<br>
An advantageous embodiment of the system results from the measure that pipeline groups or line sections are formed as construction groups of individual modules that are remanufactured in a<br>
workshop.<br>
This eliminates fitting labor in this area, the mounting hours are reduced by one third by the elimination of sorting labor and storage, and a further positive auxiliary effect Is realized by the elimination of the hydraulic pipework in the basement. Overall, this results in a reduced expenditure of the construction site pipework and a considerable improvement of the ease of maintenance and the serviceability.<br>
Further advantages result according to the features of the dependent claims.<br>
Details, features, and advantages of the invention result from the following description of an embodiment illustrated schematically in the drawing.  The drawing shows:<br>
in a perspective view, partially from the front, partially from the side,  3 rolling stand with a pipework of a<br><br>
distribution network for liquid operating media according to the invention.<br>
In the embodiment illustrated in the drawing a significant simplification of the pipeline distribution and supply network for liquid operating media, such as lubricants or coolants as well as hydraulic pressure media for control members or drives, is achieved on the rolling stand, provided with open or closed roll housings 10, 11, by the standardization of the nominal pressure to, for example, 290 bar, for all consumers of the rolling stand. The rolling stand is a four roll rolling stand with working rolls, which are supported in roll chocks 20, 22, and with support rolls, which are supported in roll chocks 21, 23.<br>
The supply and/or discharge lines of the distribution network are combined with formation of pipeline groups, for example, 12, 13, 14, to modules 1 to 3.4. Advantageously, a media-guiding column 8 with connectors 9 is provided adjacent to the rolling stand for supplying operating media to the distribution network of the rolling stand. The control station 5, correlated with the module 1, is provided in the stage at the head of the rolling stand.<br>
The distribution network comprises pipeline groups of the following modules:<br>
all consumers of a rolling stand are connected to a high-pressure distribution network for the operating media preferably having a nominal pressure of 290 bar;<br><br>
supply and/cr discharge lines of the distribution network  are combined with formation of pipeline groups (12,13,14) to modules (1-3.4);<br>
a media guiding column (8) with connectors (9) is provided adjacent to the rolling stand for supplying operating media to the distribution network of the rolling stand; and<br>
a central control station (5) is provided for controlling and monitoring the functions of the rolling stand.<br>
Considerable advantages are provided as a result of the fact the pipeline groups of pipeline sections 12-14 are formed as component groups of individual modules 1-3.4 premanufactured at a workshop.<br>
This results overall in significant advantages for the manufecture and mounting of a rolling stand, for example, by avoiding adjustment labor between modules and connecting locations, for example, of the mounting plates 6 and 7. Further advantages have been mentioned above in the description.<br>
As illustrated in the FIGURE, the combination of pipeline bundles of the individual modules has advantages in that the distribution network, as a result of laying straight pipeline sections 12 to 14 as much as possible, a comparatively minimal number of formed or bent pieces is required. Instead of a plurality of individual lines for supplying and discharging operating media to individual functional elements of the rotling stand, they now extend from central distributors 6, 7 arranged on the rolling stand which themselves are connected to collecting<br><br>
mains or modules 3.2, 3.3, 3.4 for the operating media to be supplied and discharged.<br>
Moreover, the Figure shows the advantageous arrangement of distributors 6, 7 in the form of mounting plates 4 which are preferably positioned at the inflow and outflow aides in the upper housing for connection to the pipeline groups, for example, line section 12, 13 for modules 3.2, 3.3, 3.4. The controls are arranged in four columns in the upper housing.<br>
The lines are guided independent of mechanical components such as work roll lock, support roll lock or spindle holder.<br>
The support points for the module 1 to be arranged on the roll housings 10, 11 are designed such that an adaptation of the module 1 is required only with respect to the width of the mill train. Accordingly, the mounting, maintenance or inspection labor or control can be performed during operation external to the mill train area at the control stations under easier working conditions.<br>
For connecting the modules 1 - 3.4 to one another, flexible hoses are used. By means of the flexible connection between the modules, a mounting thereof is possible without exact length requirements and, moreover, the transmission of operation-caused vibrations or<br>
shaking is completely avoided and fitting labor in this area is not required.<br>
Overall, the consequent application and use of the invention provides a significant reduction of the expenditure of the construction site pipework as well as an improvement of the<br>
serviceability and humanization of the working conditions when performing mounting and control work.<br><br>
