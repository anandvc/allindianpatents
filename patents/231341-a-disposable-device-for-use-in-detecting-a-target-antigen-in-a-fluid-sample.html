				<td>The present invention relates to a device and method for performing immunoassays. The device comprises a<br>
disposable immunosensor.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Biomedical sensors are used to report the presence and/or concentration of a wide variety of analytes. When<br>
the analyte is a protein, then the sensing element used is usually an antibody since the interaction of the antibody with<br>
the protein (antigen) is very specific Such immunoassays usually fall into two categories: a "yes/no answer" obtained,<br>
e.g., by simple visual detection, or a concentration of the antigen determined by a quantitative method. Most of the<br>
quantitative methods involve expensive pieces of equipment such as scintillation counters (for monitoring<br>
radioactivity), spectrophotometers, spectrofluorimeters (see, e.g.. U.S. 5,156,972), surface plasmon resonance<br>
instruments [see, e.g., U.S. 5,965,456), and the like, ft would therefore be advantageous to develop a quantitative<br>
immunoassay that is both inexpensive and simple enough to use to be suitable for home or field use.<br>
Conventional immunoassays are classified into two categories: competition assay and sandwich assay. In a<br>
competition assay, the antigen in the test sample is mixed with an antigen-probe complex and the mixture then<br>
competes for binding to the antibody. The probe may be an enzyme, a fluorophore or a chromophore. Secondly, in a<br>
sandwich immunoassay, the antigen in the test sample binds to the antibody and then a second antibody-probe<br>
complex binds to the antigen. In these prior art assay methods, one or more washing steps are usually required. The<br>
washing steps introduce complexity into the assay procedure and can generate biohazardous liquid waste. It would<br>
therefore be advantageous to develop, a device for performing an immunoassay that does not require any washing<br>
steps. Of necessity, such a device would be designed to be a single use disposable device.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
A quantitative, inexpensive, disposable immunosensor is provided that requires no wash steps and thus<br>
generates no liquid waste. Moreover, in preferred embodiments of the sensor, no timing steps are required of the user,<br>
and the sensor can be readily adapted to antigen-antibody interactions over a wide kinetic range.<br>

An embodiment of the sensor suitable for use with electrochemical detection is illustrated in FIGS. 1 and 2.<br>
FIG. 1 is a top view of the sensor strip and FIG. 2 is a cross-sectional view, showing details of the reaction chamber<br>
and the detection chamber.<br><br>
The Sensor<br>
The immunosensors of the preferred embodiments may be prepared using well-known thin layer device<br>
fabrication techniques as are used in preparing electrochemical glucose sensing devices (see, e.g., U.S. 5,942,102,<br>
incorporated herein by reference in its entirety). Such techniques, with certain modifications, are also used to prepare<br>
immunosensors utilizing non-electrochemical detection methods.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the immunosensor, illustrated in Figures 1 and 2, the detection chamber 28<br>
comprises an electrochemical ceil 28. The reaction chamber 22 and detection chamber 28 are prepared by first<br>
forming an aperture extending through a sheet of electrically resistive material 36. The aperture is shaped such that it<br>
defines a sidewall of both the reaction chamber 22 and the detection chamber 28, as well as the sample passageway<br>
38 between the two chambers 22 and 28. By extending the aperture from the proximal end 24 of the reaction<br>
chamber 22 through to the edge of the sheet 37, the sample ingress 24 is also formed. In one embodiment the<br>
thickness of the sheet 38 defines the entire height of the reaction chamer 22 and detection chamer 28, which are<br>
- the same. In another embodiment, the height of the reaction chamber 22 is greater than that of the detection chancer<br>
28. A reaction chamber 22 of greater height than the detection chamber 28 is prepared by layering multiple sheets<br>
32,34, and 36 together. The middle sheet 36 of the layer has an aperture defining the sidewalk 74 and 76 of both<br>
the reaction chamber 22 and detection chamber 28 as described above. This middle layer 36 is then sandwiched<br>
between two or more additional layers 32 and 34, the additional layers 32 and 34 having an aperture defining the side<br>
watt 74 of the reaction chamber 22 only, the layers 32 and 34 thereby defining end walls 60 and 62 of the detection<br>
chamber 28. In this embodiment, the end walls 60 and 62 of the detection chamber comprise electrodes 52 and 54,<br>
which may be prepared as described below.<br>
After the sidewalk 74 and 76 of the reaction chamber 22 and detection chamber 28 are formed, a first thin<br>
electrode layer 52 is then mounted on one side 70 of the sheet of electrically resistive material 36. extending over the<br>
aperture forming the detection chamber 28 and forming an end wall 60. The layer 52 may be adhered to the sheet 36,<br>
e.g., by means of an adhesive. Suitable adhesives include, for example, heat activated adhesives, pressure sensitive<br>
adhesives, heat cured adhesives, chemically cured adhesives, hot melt adhesives, hot flow adhesives, and the like. The<br>
electrode layer 52 is prepared by coating (e.g., by sputter coating) a sheet of electrically resistive material 32 with a<br>
suitable metal, for example, platinum, palladium, carbon, indium oxide, tin oxide, mixed indium/tin oxides, gold, silver,<br>
iridium, mixtures thereof, and the like. Materials suitable for use as electrodes 52 and 54 are compatible with the<br>
reagents present in the sensor 20, i.e., they will not react chemically with reagents.<br>
A second thin electrode layer 54 is then mounted on the opposite side 71 of the electrically resistive material<br>
36, also extending over the aperture forming the detection chamber 28, so as to form a second end wall 62. In a<br>
preferred embodiment, the electrode layers 52 and 54 are mounted in opposing relationship at a distance of less than<br>
about 500 microns, more preferably less than 150 microns, and most preferably between 50 and 150 microns. If a<br>
sample ingress 24 has not already been formed, then one is provided, e.g., by forming a notch in the edge 37 of the<br>
device 20 that intersects the proximal end 23 of the reaction chamber 22.<br><br>
The electrode layers 52 and 54 are provided with connection means allowing the sensor 20 to be placed Hi a<br>
measuring circuit. At least one of the electrodes 52 or 54 in the cell 28 is a sensing electrode, i.e.. an electrode<br>
sensitive to the amount of reduced redox agent in the antioxidant case or oxidized redox agent in the oxidant case. In<br>
the case of a potentiometric sensor 20 wherein the potential of the sensing electrode 52 or 54 is indicative of the level<br>
of anaryte present, a second electrode 54 or 52, acting as reference electrode is present which acts to provide a<br>
reference potential. In the case of an amperometric sensor 20 wherein the sensing electrode current is indicative of<br>
the level of analyte in the sample, at least one other electrode 54 or 52 is present which functions as a counter<br>
electrode to complete the electrical circuit. This second electrode 54 or 52 may also function as a reference electrode.<br>
Alternatively, a separate electrode (not shown) may perform the function of a reference electrode.<br>
If the immunosensor 20 is operated as an electrochemical cefl 28, then the sheets 32,34, and 36 containing<br>
the apertures defining the reaction chamber 22 and/or detection chamber 28 should comprise etectricafly resistive<br>
materials. Suitable electrically resistive materials include, for example, polyesters, polystyrenes, polycarbonates,<br>
polyolefins, mixtures thereof, and the like. A preferred polyester is polyethylene terephthalate. If the immunosensor<br>
20 is operated using a detection method other than an electrochemical detection method, men the materials need not<br>
be electrically resistive. However, the polymeric materials described above are preferred for use in constructing the<br>
immunosensors of a preferred embodiment because of their ease of processing, low cost, and lack of reactivity to<br>
reagents and samples. In the case of a detection method involving absorbance, transmission, or emission of light of a<br>
particular frequency, then the end walls 60 and/or 62 and layers 32 and 46 and/or layers 34 and 42 above the end<br>
walls of the detection chamber 28 should be transparent to that light frequency.<br>
Reagents for use in the cefl 28, e.g., immobilized antibody, probe-linked antigen, buffer, mediator, and the<br>
like, may be supported on the walls 40,48, and/or 74 of the reaction chamber 22 or on the walls 60,62, and/or 76 of<br>
the detection chamber 28, on an independent support contained within chambers, within a matrix, or may be self<br>
supporting. If the reagents are to be supported on the chamber walls or electrodes 52 and 54, the chemicals may be<br>
applied by use of printing techniques well known in the art, e.g., ink jet printing, screen printing, lithography, and the<br>
like. In a preferred embodiment, a solution containing the reagent is applied to a surface within a chamber and allowed<br>
to dry.<br>
Rather than immobilize or dry the antibodies 44, the probe-linked antigen 50, or other chemicals onto the<br>
surfaces 40,48, 60,62, 74, and/or 76 of the reaction chamber 22 or detection chamber 28, it may be advantageous<br>
to support them on or contain them within one or more independent supports which are then placed into a chamber.<br>
Suitable independent supports include, but are not limited to, mesh materials, nonwoven sheet materials, fibrous fMing<br>
materials, macroporous membranes, or sintered powders. The advantages of independent supports include an<br>
increased surface area, thus allowing more antibody and probe-linked antigen to be included in the reaction chamber<br>
28, if desired. In such an embodiment, the antibody is immobilized on one piece of porous material and placed in the<br>
first reaction chamber and the probe-linked antigen is dried onto a second piece of porous material, which is then<br>
placed into the reaction chamber. Alternatively, either the antibody or the probe-linked antigen is incorporated onto the<br><br>
porous material and the other component supported on the reaction chamber wall as described above. In yet another<br>
embodiment, the walls of the reaction chamber themselves are porous, with the antibody and/or probe-linked antigen<br>
incorporated in them. In this embodiment, the liquid is able to wick into the porous wall, but not leak out of the<br>
defined area. This is accomplished by using a macroporous membrane to form the reaction chamber wall and<br>
compressing the membrane around the reaction chamber to prevent leakage of sample out of the desired area.<br>
Suitable independent supports such as mesh materials, nonwoven sheet materials, and fibrous fill materials<br>
include, polyolefins, polyesters, nylons, cellulose, polystyrenes, polycarbonates, polysulfones, mixtures thereof, and the<br>
like. Suitable macroporous membranes may be prepared from polymeric materials including polysulfones,<br>
polyvinyKdene dif luorides, nylons, cellulose acetates, polymethacrylates, polyacrylates, mixtures thereof, and the like.<br>
The protein or antibody may be contained within a matrix, e.g., polyvinyl acetate. By varying the solubility<br>
characteristics of the matrix in the sample, controlled release of the protein or antibody into the sample may be<br>
achieved.<br>
In all cases, the materials used within the sensor are in a form amenable to mass production, and the cells<br>
themselves are designed to be able to be used for a single experiment then disposed of.<br>
A preferred embodiment of an immunosensor that is fabricated as described above is ilustrated in Figures 1<br>
and 2. In this preferred embodiment, the layers 32 and 34 are substrates coated with electrically conductive material<br>
52 and 54. The electrically conductive material 52 or 54 on the surface 60 or 62 facing the detection chamber 28<br>
and an adhesive layer (not shown) coated on the surface 33 or 35 facing layer 42 or 46, respectively.<br>
Using the Sensor to Determine the Presence or Absence of an Antigen<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the sensor 20 is an electrochemical cell 28 utilizing an enzyme, e.g., glucose<br>
oxidase or glucose dehydrogenase, as the probe, as illustrated in Figure 1, a top view of such a sensor 20, and Figure<br>
2, a cross section of the sensor through line A-A'. The presence or absence of an anafyte is inferred in this<br>
embodiment as follows.<br>
The user first introduces sample into the reaction chamber 22 of the sensor 20 through the sample ingress<br>
24. The sample is drawn into the reaction chamber 22 under the influence of capillary or wicking action. During filling<br>
the reaction chamber vent 26 is open to the atmosphere, thus allowing air displaced by the sample to escape. Sample<br>
will be drawn into the reaction chamber 22 until it is filled up to the reaction chamber vent 26, whereupon filling will<br>
stop. The volume of the reaction chamber 22 is chosen so as to be at least equal to and preferably larger than the<br>
volume of the detection chamber 28.<br>
The dashed circle in Figure 1 denotes an aperture 30 piercing layers 32, 34, and 36 but not layers 42 and<br>
46, the aperture in layer 34 opening into the detection chamber 28. Since layers 42 and 46 are not pierced initially,<br>
the only opening to the atmosphere of the detection chamber 28 is the sample passageway 38 opening into the<br>
reaction chamber 22. Thus, when the reaction chamber 22 fills with sample, it blocks the sample passageway 38 to<br>
the detection chamber 28. This traps air in the detection chamber 28 and substantially prevents it from filling; with<br>
sample. A small amount of sample will enter the detection chamber 28 during the time between when the sample first<br><br>
contacts the opening 38 to the detection chamber 28 and when it contacts the far side of the opening 38. However,<br>
once the sample has wet totally across the opening 38 to the detection chamber 28, no more fling of the detection<br>
chamber 28 will take place.<br>
The internal surface 40 of the substrate 42, which forms the base of the reaction chamber 22, is coated<br>
with antibodies 44 to the antigen to be detected. The antibodies 44 are adsorbed or otherwise mrnnoffized on the<br>
surface 40 of the substrate 42 such that they are not removed from the substrate 42 during a test. Optionally, after<br>
application of the antibodies 44 to the internal surface 40 of the substrate 42, an agent designed to prevent non-<br>
specific binding of proteins to this surface can be applied (not shown). An example of such an agent well known in the<br>
art is bovine serum albumin (BSA). A nonionic surfactant may also be used as such an agent e.g., Triton X100™<br>
manufactured by Rohm &amp; Haas of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, or Tween™ manufactured by ICI Americas of<br>
Wilmington, Delaware. The nonionic surfactant selected does not denature proteins. The coating 44 on the internal<br>
surface 48 of the substrate 42 is in the dry state when ready to be used in a test.<br>
Another substrate 46 defines the top surface 48 of the reaction chamber 22. On the internal surface 48 of<br>
the substrate 46 are coated enzymes linked to the antigen 50 to be detected. Examples of suitable enzymes include,<br>
but are not limited to, glucose oxidase and glucose dehydrogenase. The enzyme-finked antigen 50 is dried onto the<br>
internal surface 48 of the substrate 66 m such a way that it can be liberated into the sample when this surface 48 is<br>
wet by the sample. The internal surface 48 of the substrate 46 and the method for coating on the enzyme-linked<br>
antigen 60 are therefore chosen such that only a weak bond between the enzyme-linked antigen SO and the internal<br>
surface 48 of the substrate 46 exists. The rate of dissolution of the enzyme-linked antigen 50 from the surface 48 is<br>
chosen such that little dissolution has occurred during the time taken for the sample to fiH the reaction chamber 22. In<br>
this manner, the enzyme-linked antigen 50 win be evenly distributed throughout the area of the reaction chamber 22<br>
after filling.<br>
The relative amounts of enzyme-linked antigen 50 and antibody 44 are chosen such that there is a sight<br>
excess of antibody 44 over enzyme-linked antigen 50. In this context, a slight excess is defined to be such that the<br>
excess is small when compared to the number of antigen molecules to be detected in the sample.<br>
Thus, when sample fills the reaction chamber 22 the enzyme-linked antigen 50 enters and mixes with the<br>
sample. Sufficient time is then allowed for the enzyme-linked antigen 50 to come into contact with the antibodies 44.<br>
Since there is an excess of antibodies 44, if no antigen is present in the sample then substantially all of the enzyme-<br>
linked antigen 50 will bind to the antibodies 44 and so be effectively immobilized. If antigen is present in the sample,<br>
the antigen, being smaller than the enzyme-linked antigen 50 and already present throughout the volume of the sample,<br>
will contact and bind to the antibodies 44 before the enzyme-linked antigen 50 contacts the antibodies 44. The<br>
antibodies 44 will therefore be blocked and prevented from binding to the enzyme-linked antigen 50. So if antigen is<br>
initially present in the sample then, at the end of the reaction step, enzyme-finked antigen 50 wll remain mobile in the<br>
sample. If no antigen is initially present in the sample, the enzyme-linked antigen 50 will be immobilized on the internal<br>
surface 48 of the substrate 46 at the end of the reaction step.<br><br>
The end of the reaction step is a predetermined time after the sample is introduced into the reaction chamber<br>
22. The predetermined tone is set such that there is sufficient time for substantially all of the enzyme-finked antigen<br>
50 to bind to the antibodies 44 under the test conditions when no antigen is initially present in the sample.<br>
The time that the sample is introduced into the reaction chamber 22 can be indicated by the user, for<br>
example, by depressing a button on a meter connected to the sensor 20. This action is used to trigger a timing device.<br>
In the case of visual detection, no meter device is necessary. In such an embodiment, the user manually times the<br>
reaction period.<br>
In the case where electrochemical detection is used to detect the result of the antibody/antigen reactions,<br>
the indication that sample has been introduced into the reaction chamber 22 can be automated. As described above,<br>
when sample fills the reaction chamber 22, a small portion of the detection chamber 28 at its opening 38 into the<br>
reaction chamber 22 wl be wet by sample. If electrochemical detection is employed then at least two electrodes 52<br>
and 54 wi to present m the detection chamber 28. If these electrodes 52 and 54 are placed in the detection chamber<br>
28, such that at least a portion of each electrode 52 and 54 is contacted by the sample during the filling of the<br>
reaction chamber 22, the presence of the sample w31 bridge the electrodes 52 and 54 and create an electrical signal<br>
which can be used to trigger the timing device.<br>
A predetermined time after the timing device has been triggered, either by the user or automatically, the<br>
antibody/antigen reaction phase of the test is deemed to be completed. When the antibody/antigen phase of the test is<br>
completed, the vent 56 to the atmosphere is opened. For example, a solenoid activated needle in the meter may be<br>
used to pierce layer 42 or layer 46 or both layers 42 and 46, thus opening the distal end 58 of the detection chamber<br>
28 to the atmosphere. The piercing can be automatically performed by the meter, as in the example above, or<br>
manually by the user in the case of visual detection wherein no meter may be used, e.g., the user inserts a needle<br>
through the layers 42 and 46, thereby forming the vent 56.<br>
The opening of the vent 56 to the atmosphere allows the air trapped in the detection chamber 28 to escape,<br>
thereby allowing the detection chamber 28 to be filled with reacted sample from the reaction chamber 22. The<br>
reacted sample will be drawn into the detection chamber 28 due to increased capillary force in the detection chamber<br>
28 compared to that present in the reaction chamber 22. In a preferred embodiment, the increased capillary force is<br>
provided by suitably coating the surfaces 60 and 62 of the detection chamber 28 or, more preferably, by choosing the<br>
capillary distance for the detection chamber 28 to be smaller than that of the reaction chamber 22. In this<br>
embodiment, the capillary distance is defined to be the smallest dimension of the chamber.<br>
Optionally disposed in the detection chamber 28 are dried reagents 64 comprising an-enzyme substrate and a<br>
mediator, capable of reacting with the enzyme part of the enzyme-linked antigen 50 to produce a detectable signal.<br>
The enzyme substrate and mediator, if present, are to be of sufficient amount such that the rate of reaction of any<br>
enzyme present with the enzyme substrate 64 is determined by the amount of enzyme present. For instance, if the<br>
enzyme were glucose oxidase or glucose dehydrogenase, a suitable enzyme mediator 64 and glucose (if not already<br>
present in the sample) would be disposed into the detection chamber 28. Buffer may also be included to help adjust<br><br>
the pH of the sample in the detection chamber 28. In an embodiment wherein an electrochemical detection system is<br>
used, ferricyanide is a suitable mediator. Other suitable mediators include dicWorophenolindophenol and complexes<br>
between transition metals and nitrogen-containing heteroatomic species. The glucose, mediator and buffer reagents<br>
64 are present in sufficient quantities such that the rate of reaction of the enzyme with the enzyme substrate 64 is<br>
limited by the concentration of the enzyme present.<br>
When the detection chamber 28 is filled, the reagents 64 dissolve into the sample. The enzyme component<br>
of the reagents 64 reacts with the glucose and the mediator to produce reduced mediator. This reduced mediator is<br>
electrochemically oxidized at an electrode 52 or 54 acting as an anode in the detection chamber 28 to produce an<br>
electrical current. In one embodiment, the rate of change of this current with time is used as an indicator of the<br>
presence and amount of enzyme that is present in the reacted sample, if the rate of change of current is less than a<br>
predetermined threshold value, then it is indicative of no significant amount of enzyme-finked antigen 50 present in the<br>
reacted sample, indicating the lack of antigen present in the original sample. If the rate of change of current is higher<br>
than the threshold rate, it indicates that enzyme-inked antigen 50 is present m the reacted sample, and thus antigen is<br>
also present in the sample initially. In one embodiment the rate of change of the current is used to give a measure of<br>
the relative amount of antigen initially present in the sample.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the electrochemical detection system, the electrodes 52 and 54 in the<br>
detection chamber 28 are formed as electrically conductive layers coated onto the internal surfaces 60 and 62 of<br>
substrates 32 and 34, e.g., by sputtering as disclosed in W097/18464. These conductive layers 52 and 54 are of<br>
materials that do not react chemically with reagent present and are useful as electrodes 52 and 54 at the potential of<br>
choice. Examples of suitable materials include, but are not limited to, palladium, platinum, gold, iridium, carbon, carbon<br>
mixed with a binder, indium oxide, tin oxide, and mixed oxides of indium and tin.<br>
In this embodiment, an inert, electrically insulating layer 36 separates the electrode-bearing substrates 32<br>
and 34. Preferably, insulating layer 36 functions to keep layers 32 and 34 at a predetermined separation. Provided<br>
this separation is small enough, e.g., less than 500 micron and more preferably from 50 to 150 microns, the current<br>
flowing between the electrodes 52 and 54 will be directly proportional to the concentration of reduced mediator after<br>
a suitably short time relative to the detection time employed. In this embodiment, the rate of current rise is directly<br>
related to the rate of the enzyme reaction and therefore the amount of enzyme present.<br>
In Figure 1, a connection end 66 is shown. The electrodes 54 and 56 in the detection chamber 28 can be<br>
placed in electrical connection with a meter {not shown) through the connection end 66. The connection means {not<br>
shown) are in electrical connection with the electrodes 54 and 56 in the detection chamber 28 via conducting tracks<br>
(not shown), to the preferred embodiment illustrated in Figure 1, these conducting tracks consist of extensions of the<br>
films of conductor 52 and 54 coated onto the internal surfaces of 32 and 34. The meter in connection with the<br>
connection area 66 is capable of applying a potential between the electrodes 52 and 54 in the detection chamber 28,<br>
analyzing the electrical signals generated, displaying a response and optionally storing the response in memory.<br><br>
in other embodiments utilizing electrochemical detection, stripes of conducting material on one or both<br>
internal faces of the detection chamber are used, with the provision that at least two electrodes are present, i.e., a<br>
sensing electrode and a counter/reference electrode. Optionally, a third electrode, serving as a separate reference<br>
electrode, is included.<br>
In the case of an embodiment wherein visual detection or reflectance spectroscopy is the detection method<br>
used, at least the layers 32 and 46 or layers 34 and 42 are transparent to the wavelength of radiation that is to be<br>
observed. In the case of visual detection, a simple color change in the detection chamber 28 is observed. In the case<br>
of reflectance spectroscopy, detection radiation is shone through layers 32 and 46 or layers 34 and 42, and radiation<br>
reflected from the solution in the detection chamber 28 is analyzed. In the case of transmission spectroscopy used as<br>
the detection method, at least layers 32, 46, 34, and 42 are transparent to radiation at the wavelength of choice.<br>
Radiation is shone through the sample in the detection chamber 28 and tne attenuation of the beam is measured.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of a method of constructing the sensor, layer 36 comprises a substrate with a<br>
layer of adhesive (not shown) coated on its upper surface 70 and lower surface 72. Examples of materials suitable for<br>
the substrate of layer 36 include polyester, polystyrene, polycarbonate, polyolefins, and, preferably, polyethylene<br>
terephthalate. Examples of suitable adhesives are pressure sensitive adhesives, heat and chemically curing adhesives<br>
and hot melt and hot flow adhesives.<br>
Use of Melitten as a Probe<br>
Conventional ELISAs link an antigen to an enzyme. However, it is also possible to link the antigen to mefittin,<br>
a polypeptide found in bee venom. In this embodiment, a probe-linked antigen comprising an antigen-melrrtin complex<br>
can be dried on a wall of the reaction chamber, as described above. The detection chamber can contain a mediator<br>
comprising ferrocyanide in liposomes or lipid vesicles. If the antigen-melrttin complex reaches the liposomes, they will<br>
burst and release the ferrocyanide. This leads to a rapid amplification of the signal, i.e., a small amount of free antigen<br>
competes with the antigen-melittin complex for binding sites on the antibodies and results in a large concentration of<br>
ferrocyanide.<br>
Use of Horse Radish Peroxidase and Alkaline Phosphatase in Electrochemical Assays<br>
Conventional ELISAs use horse radish peroxidase (HRP) or alkaline phosphatase (AP) as the enzymes in a<br>
colorimetric assay. However, substrates have been developed which allow both these enzymes to be used in an<br>
electrochemical assay.<br>
In this embodiment, AP can be used with p-aminophenyi phosphate and HRP can be used with tetrathtafulvalene.<br>
Obtaining Electrochemical Measurements Using The Immunosensor<br>
in certain embodiments, information relating to the rate of a chemical reaction that yields at least one<br>
electroactive product can be obtained using the sensor by ensuring that the chemical reaction is localized at a site<br>
remote from the electrode used to electrocbemicalty react the electroactive produces).<br>
The site of the chemical reaction is sufficiently removed from the electrode such that the mass transfer of<br>
the electroactive species from the chemical reaction site to the electrode effectively controls the current flowing at the<br><br>
electrode at any time. This arrangement ensures a substantially linear electroactive species concentration gradient<br>
between the chemical reaction she and the electrode. The concentration of the electroactive species is maintained at<br>
effectively zero at the electrode by the electrochemical reaction taking place there. The time course of the magnitude<br>
of this concentration gradient wi therefore be substantially determined only by the time course of the concentration<br>
of the electroactive specie(s) at the chemical reaction site and the diffusion coefficient(s) of the electroactive reaction<br>
product(s) in the liquid medium. Since the current flowing at the electrode is proportional to the concentration gradient<br>
of the electroactive specie(s) at the electrode, the time course of this current will reflect the time course of the<br>
chemical reaction occurring at the remote site. This allows the current measured at the electrode (or charge passed if<br>
the current is integrated) to be a used as a convenient measure of the rate and extent of the chemical reaction taking<br>
place.<br>
An example of a suitable method for ensuring that the chemical reaction is remote from the working<br>
electrode is to immobilize one or more of the reaction components on a solid surface remote from the electrode. The<br>
reaction component(s) can be imobilized by Incorporating them in a polymeric matrix that is dried on or otherwise<br>
attached to the solid surface. The reaction component(s) can also be tethered directly to the soKd surface either by<br>
chemical or physical bonding. Alternatively one or more of the reaction components can simply be dried onto the solid<br>
surface without special immobilization means, in this situation one or more of the reaction components is sufficiently<br>
low in mobility, in the liquid matrix filling the electrochemical cell, that it does not migrate substantially from the<br>
position where it was dried during the time period that the electrochemical current can be usefully monitored to<br>
perform the required measurement. In this context substantial migration means that the slowest moving component<br>
required for the chemical reaction approaches closely enough to the working electrode that Cottrell type depletion<br>
kinetics begin to effect the time course of the current flowing at the electrode.<br>
The range of separation distance between the chemical reaction site and the working electrode in preferred<br>
embodiments is desirably less than about 1 cm, preferably less than 5 mm, more preferably between 5,10, 50,100.<br>
200, 500 microns and 5 mm, more preferably between 5, 10, 50, 100, 200 and 500 microns, and most preferably<br>
between 5,10,50,100 and 200 microns.<br>
As well as the working electrode, at least a counter electrode in contact with the liquid sample is provided to<br>
complete the electrochemical circuit. Optionally the counter electrode can function as a combined counter/reference<br>
electrode or a separate reference electrode can be provided. In a preferred embodiment, the working electrode and<br>
counter electrode are desirably spaced apart at a distance greater than about 300 microns, preferably at a distance<br>
greater than about 500 microns, more preferably at a distance between about 500 microns and 10 mm, more<br>
preferably at a distance between about 500 microns and 1,2,5 mm, and most preferably between 1 mm and 2,5,10<br>
mm.<br>
The working electrode is constructed of materials that do not react chemically with any component with<br>
which it will come into contact during use to an extent that interferes with the current response of the electrode. If<br>
the working electrode is to be used as an anode then examples of suitable materials are platinum, palladium, carbon,<br><br>
carbon in combination with inert binders, iridium, indium oxide, tin oxide, mixtures of indium and tin oxide. If the<br>
working electrode is to be used as a cathode then in addition to the material listed above other suitable materials are<br>
steel, stainless steel, copper, nickel, silver and chromium.<br>
Examples of materials suitable for the counter electrode are platinum, palladium, carbon, carbon in<br>
combination with inert binders, iridium, indium oxide, tin oxide, mixture of indium and tin oxide, steel, stainless steel,<br>
copper, nickel, chromium, siver and silver coated with a substantially insoluble silver salt such as silver chloride, silver<br>
bromide, silver iodide, silver ferrocyanide, silver ferricyanide.<br>
The site of the chemical reaction can be localized on a bare wall or on the counter electrode, remote from the<br>
working electrode. The she of the chemical reaction can be on the same plane as the working electrode or more<br>
preferably in a plane facing and substantially parallel to the working electrode.<br>
A sensor suitable for use with certain embodiments includes a working electrode and a counter electrode<br>
which are disposed on an dectrically insulating substrate. On a second substrate is disposed a layer of chemical<br>
reactants, where at least one of the reactants is substantially immobilized on the substrate. In use, the space between<br>
walls of the sensor is filled with a liquid containing a substance which is capable of reacting with the reagents to<br>
produce at least one etectroactive species. The products of the chemical reaction diffuse towards the working<br>
electrode where the etectroactive specie(s) are etectrocbemically reacted to produce a current. The magnitude of the<br>
current or the charge passed at a particular time, or the time course of the current or charge passed can then be used<br>
to obtain a measure of the rate or extent of the chemical reaction occurring at the reactant layer.<br>
In another embodiment of the sensor, the reactants are disposed on the counter electrode which is disposed<br>
on an electrically resistive substrate. In this embodiment the materials of construction of the counter electrode, are<br>
inert to reaction with any of the components of the reactants disposed on the electrode.<br>
The method of obtaining an electrochemical measurement deserted above may be applied to any suitable<br>
electrochemical system, including electrochemical immunoassay systems. An example of the method as applied to a<br>
typical, albeit non-immunoassay, electrochemical system is measuring glucose in whole blood using the enzyme PQQ<br>
dependent glucose dehydrogenase (GDHpqq) and a redox mediator. In this reaction glucose in the blood reacts with<br>
GDHpqq to form gluconic acid. In the process, the PQQ in the enzyme is reduced. A mediator, such as potassium<br>
ferricyanide, then oxidizes the PQQ in the enzyme and forms ferrocyanide. The enzyme in the oxidized form can then<br>
react with further glucose. The net effect of this reaction is to produce two ferrocyanide molecules for each glucose<br>
molecule reacted. Ferrocyanide is an electroactive species, and so can be oxidized at an electrode to produce a current.<br>
Other suitable enzymes for this reaction are glucose oxidase (GOD) or NAD dependent glucose dehydrogenase. For<br>
other reactions, lactate dehydrogenase and alcohol dehydrogenase may be used. Other suitable redox mediators<br>
include ferrocinium, osmium complexes with bipyridine, and benzophenone.<br>
The reaction of glucose in whole blood with the enzyme can be slow, taking up to a few minutes to go to<br>
completion. Also, the higher the haematocrit of the blood sample, the slower the reaction. The haematocrit of the<br>
blood is the volume fraction of red cells in the whole Wood sample. For example, a solution containing 50 mg/ml<br><br>
GDHpqq, 0.9 M potassium ferricyanide and 50 mM buffer at pH 6.5 was deposited on the counter electrode and the<br>
water removed to leave a dried reactant layer. In this layer the GDHpqq is large enough to be effectively immobilized<br>
on the counter electrode, whereas the ferricyanide can mix more evenly throughout the liquid in the electrochemical<br>
cell. The blood sample was introduced into the cell and a potential of +300 mV immediately applied between the<br>
working electrode and the counter electrode. Although a potential of +300 mV is most preferred for oxidizing<br>
ferrocyanide, the potential is desirably between +40 mV and +600 mV, preferably between +50 mV and +500 mV,<br>
and more preferably between +200 mV and +400 mV. In the cell, the working electrode consisted of a layer of gold<br>
sputtered onto a polyester substrate and the counter electrode consisted of a layer of palladium sputtered onto a<br>
polyester substrate.<br>
Current traces were recorded for blood samples of different haematocrits, showing a faster rate of reaction<br>
in lower haematocrit blood, i.e., 20%, 42%, and 65% haematocrit in blood. The glucose level in each blood sample<br>
was approximately the same, namely 5.4 mM for the 65% haematocrit sample, 5.5 mM for the 42% haematocrit<br>
sample, and 6.0 mM for the 20% haematocrit sample.<br>
The current measured can be approximately given by the equation:<br>
i = -FADC/L<br>
where i is the current, F is Faraday's constant (96486.7 C/mole), A is the electrode area, D is the diffusion coefficient<br>
of the ferrocyanide in the sample, C is the concentration of ferrocyanide at the reaction site and L is the distance<br>
between the reaction site and the electrode. The reaction rate, given by the rate of change of C with time is therefore<br>
given by:<br>
dC/dt - -(L/FADWi/dt.<br>
For the reactions discussed above, between 6 and 8 seconds for the 20%, 42%, and 65% haematocrit samples, the<br>
average di/dt was 3.82,2.14 and 1.32 microamps/second, respectively. The diffusion coefficients of ferrocyanide for<br>
these samples were 2.0 x 106, 1.7 x 106 and 1.4 x 106 crrftsec for 20%, 42%, and 65% haematocrit samples,<br>
respectively. The electrode area was 0.1238 cm2 and L was 125 microns. These values yield reaction rates of 2.0,<br>
