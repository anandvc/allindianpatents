Reducing the level of an unsaturated amine in a mixture containing an aminonitrile, a diamine, a dinitrile or mixtures thereof<br>
Description<br>
The present invention relates to a process for reducing the level of an aliphatic monounsaturated amine (IV) in a mixture (V) containing an aminonitrile (I) or a diamine (II) or a dinitrile (III) or mixtures thereof as well as said amine (IV) by<br>
a)	reacting said mixture (V) with an anionic nucleophile (VI)<br>
which contains a nucleophilic atom selected from the group consisting of<br>
oxygen, nitrogen and sulfur,<br>
which is capable of taking up an H+ ion to form an acid having a pKa value in the range from 7 to 11, as measured in water at 2 5°C, and<br>
which has a relative nucleophilicity, as measured in methyl perchlorate/methanol at 25°C, in the range from 3.4 to 4.7 when said nucleophilic atom is oxygen,<br>
in the range from 4.5 to 5.8 when said nucleophilic atom is nitrogen, and<br>
in the range from 5.5 to 6.8 when said nucleophilic atom is sulfur,<br>
in an amount in the range from 0,01 to 10 mol per mole of said amine (IV) in said mixture (V) at a temperature in the range from 50 to 200°C to obtain a mixture (VII),<br>
b)	distilling said aminonitrile (I) or said diamine (II) or said<br>
dinitrile (III) or mixtures thereof from said mixture (VII)<br>
at a temperature in the range from 50 to 200°C and at a<br>
pressure in the range from 0.1 to 100 kPa to obtain a bottom<br>
product (VIII),<br>
which comprises<br><br>
c)  distilling an aminonitrile (I) or diamine' (II) or dinitriie (III) or mixtures thereof from said bottom product (VIII) at a temperature which is lower than that chosen in step b).<br>
Mixtures containing an aminonitrile, a diamine, a dinitriie or mixtures thereof as well as an unsaturated amine (for the purposes of the present invention an unsaturated amine being a cyclic or linear compound containing at least one carbon-nitrogen double bond or a compound capable of forming at least one carbon-nitrogen double bond, for example by an elimination reaction) are customarily obtained in the partial hydrogenation of dinitriles to aminonitriles or to a mixture of aminonitriles and diamines or in the full hydrogenation of dinitriles to diamines.<br>
The partial hydrogenation of adiponitrile (ADN) to coproduce hexamethylenediamine (HMD) and 6-aminocapronitrile (ACN) and also the full hydrogenation of ADN to HMD in the presence of a catalyst based on a metal such as nickel, cobalt, iron, rhodium or ruthenium is generally known, for example from: K. Weissermel, H.-J.Arpe, Industrielle Organische Chemie, 3rd edition, VCH Verlagsgesellschaft mbH, Weinheim, 1988, page 266, US-A 4 601 859, US-A 2 762 835, US-A 2 208 598, DE-A 848 654, DE-A 954 416, DE-A 42 35 466, US-A 3 696 153, DE-A 19500222, WO-A-92/21650 and DE-A-19548289.<br>
By-products include azepine derivatives such as<br>
N-(2-azepano)-1,6-diaminohexane and<br>
N-(2-a2epano)-6-aminocapronitrile, especially 2-aminoazepan and<br>
tetrahydroazepine (THA).<br>
These azepine derivatives, which on account of their coloring effect and their adverse effect on product properties constitute undesirable impurities in the aminonitriles and diamines customarily used for the manufacture of fibers or engineering plastics, are very difficult to separate from the aminonitriles, diamines or mixtures thereof.<br>
EP-A-497333 describes the separation of aliphatic aminonitriles or aliphatic diamines from mixtures containing an aliphatic aminonitrile or aliphatic diamine and a cyclic aliphatic monounsaturated amine by addition of bases in a stoichiometric excess, based on the cyclic aliphatic monounsaturated amine. Bases which are recommended include alkali metal hydroxides, alkaline earth metal hydroxides, tetraalkylammonium hydroxide, alkali metal alkoxides and alkaline earth metal alkoxides.<br><br>
The disadvantage of this process is a concurrently occurring polymerization of product of value that leads to an appreciable loss of product of value and to undesirable deposits in the vessels and machines used to practice the process.<br>
PCT/EPOl/13954, as yet unpublished at the date of the present application, describes reducing the level of an aliphatic monounsaturated amine in a mixture containing an aminonitrile, a diamine or mixtures thereof as well as the aliphatic monounsaturated amine in a process which corresponds to steps a) and b) of the present process. The bottom product obtained in step b) is discarded in the cited process.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a process f,or reducing the level of an aliphatic monounsaturated amine in a mixture containing an aminonitrile or diamine or mixtures thereof and an aliphatic monounsaturated amine in a technically simple and economical manner with a higher yield of product of value while avoiding the disadvantages mentioned.<br>
We have found that this object is achieved, surprisingly, by the process defined at the beginning in that further aminonitrile (I) , diamine (II) , dinitrile (III) or mixtures thereof are obtainable by a distillation as per step c) from the bottom product already obtained by distillation in step b).<br>

In the case of iron-based catalysts, useful promoters include in particular one or more, such as two, three, four or five, elements selected from the group consisting of aluminumi, silicon, zirconium, titanium and vanadium.<br>
Such catalysts and also the process conditions for the reactions mentioned may for example be taken from the publications already mentioned above.<br>

Similarly, the amines (IV) mentioned may be formed by oxidation of amines such as HMD, for example with gases containing molecular oxygen.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the mixture (V) may be the reaction effluent obtained from the partial catalytic hydrogenation, such as gas phase hydrogenation or liquid phase hydrogenation, of<br><br>

be a mixture containing aminonitrile (I), dinitrile (III) and<br>
amine (IV) , especially ACN as aminonitrile (I) , residual ADN as<br>
dinitrile (III) and tetrahydroazepine as amine (IV) in the case<br>

is the starting compound, may have the dinitrile (III) , and the<br>
diamine (I) removed from it prior to step a) by a conventional<br>

From experience to date, it may be preferable for any catalyst used in the hydrogenation to be separated off before the mixture (V) is used in the process of the present invention.<br>
According to the invention, mixture (V) is admixed with an anionic nucleophile (VI) .<br>
The term "anionic" means for the purposes of the present invention that the nucleophile (VI) carries one or more, such as two or three, preferably one, net negative charge.<br>
The term "nucleophilic" means for the purposes of the present invention the ability of a compound, as described in Koskikallo, Acta Chem. Scand. 23 (1969) pages 1477-1489, to displace the perchlorate group from methyl perchlorate in methanolic solution at 25°C, the remaining methyl group becoming attached to compound (VI) via a nucleophilic atom of compound (VI) .<br>
The nucleophilic atom of compound (VI) may be an atom selected from the group consisting of nitrogen, oxygen and sulfur, preferably nitrogen or oxygen.<br>
According to the invention, compound (VI) is capable of taking up an H+ ion to form an acid having a pKa value in the range from 7 to 11, and preferably in the range from 8 to 10.5, as measured in water at 25oC.<br>
According to the invention, compound (VI) has a relative nucleophilicity, as measured in methyl perchlorate/methanol at 25°C as per Koskikallo, Acta Chem. Scand. 23 (1969) pages 1477-1489, and as determined as per pages 1487-1488, in the range from 3.4 to 4.7 and preferably in the range from 3.6 to 4.6 when oxygen is nucleophilic atom, in the range from 4.5 to 5.8 and preferably from 4.8 to 5.7 when nitrogen is the nucleophilic atom and in the range from 5.5 to 6.8 and preferably in the range from 5.8 to 6.7 when sulfur is the nucleophilic atom.<br><br>
When oxygen is the nucleophilic atom of (VI), phenates can be used with advantage, in which case the aromatic ring system of the phenate may be monosubstituted or polysubstituted, such as disubstituted or trisubstituted, for example by a C1- to C4-alkyl group, such as methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, i-propyl, n-butyl, i-butyl, s-butyl, t-butyl, by halogen, such as fluorine, chlorine, bromine, iodine, by a nitro group, by an ester group, by a carbonyl group or by an amino group.<br>
When nitrogen is the nucleophilic atom of (VI), advantageous compounds contain the structural unit<br>
(R4R5 N)'<br>
where<br>
R4: radical of an organic aliphatic, arylaliphatic or arylic acid, preferably carboxylic acid or sulfonic acid group,<br>
and<br>
R4 may be substituted as already described above for phenate, and<br>
R5: radical of an organic aliphatic, arylaliphatic or arylic acid, preferably carboxylic acid or sulfonic acid group, or hydrogen or a C1- to C4-alkyl group, such as methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, i-propyl, n-butyl, i-butyl, s-butyl, t-butyl, and R5 may be substituted as already described above for phenate,<br>
and R4 and R5 may be linked together other than by the nitrogen mentioned in the above formula, for example via an alkylene, alkylarylene or arylene bridge, preferably via an arylene bridge.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the nucleophile (VI) can be a lactam anion of the general formula<br>
where <br>
R6       is an alkylene radical having 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 or 11 carbon atoms belonging to the ring system, and R6 may be substituted as already described above for phenate.<br><br>
In a preferred embodiment, the nucleophile (VI)  be caprolactam anion.<br>
In a further particularly preferred embodiment, the nucleophile (VI) can be benzenesulfonamide anion.<br>
In a further particularly preferred embodiment, the nucleophile (VI) can be phthalimide anion.<br>
In a further particularly preferred embodiment, the nucleophile (VI) can be phenate.<br>
To balance the negative charge on the anionic nucleophile (VI), the latter can be used together with one or more cations, preferably selected from the group consisting of lithium, sodium, potassium, rubidium, cesium, magnesium and calcium, especially consisting of lithium, sodium, potassium, magnesium and calcium and more preferably consisting of sodium and potassium.<br>
According to the invention, the mixture (V) is admixed with the nucleophile (VI) in an amount in the range from 0.01 to 10 mol per mole of amine (IV) in mixture (V) .<br>
Advantageously, the amount of nucleophile (VI) can be at least 0.05 and preferably at least 0.1 mol and especially 0.2 mol per mole of amine (IV) in mixture (V) .<br>
Advantageously, the amount of nucleophile (VI) can be at most 1 and especially at most 0.8 and more preferably at most 0.5 mol per mole of amine (VI) in mixture (V) .<br>
The nucleophile (VI) can be added to the mixture (V) in a conventional manner, for example in conventional mixing apparatus, such as vessels, product lines and mixing means, to give a mixture (VTI) .<br>
The nucleophile (VI) can be added to the mixture (V) before the mixture (VII) is introduced into a distillation apparatus for removal as per step b).<br>
Average mean contact times of at least 5 minutes and preferably at least 10 minutes between mixture (V) and nucleophile (VI) prior to addition into a distillation apparatus have been determined to be advantageous.<br><br>
In general, distinctly longer resiaence times, sucn as more than 30 minutes, have been determined to be increasingly advantageous, although appreciably longer residence times become increasingly uneconomical.<br>
From experience to date, average mean contact times between mixture (V) and nucleophile (VI) prior to addition into a distillation apparatus cf not more than 3 60 minutes and preferably not more than 18 0 minutes and especially not more than 120 minutes have been decenr.ined to be advantageous.<br>
Temperatures are advantageously not more than 2 00°C, preferably not more than 190°C and especially not more than 180°C.<br>
Temperatures are advantageously at least 50°C, preferably at least 100°C and especially at least 140°C.<br>
It is similarly possible to introduce mixture (V) and nucleophile (VI) to such an apparatus separately and to conduct the reaction of mixture (V) with nucleophile (VI) and the removal as per step in one process step, Nucleophile (VI) can be added to the distillation apparatus at the top, over the entire height onto one of the separation stages or into the pot.<br>
