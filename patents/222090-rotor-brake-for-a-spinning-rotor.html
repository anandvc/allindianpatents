I, ASTRID TERRY, Translator of 11 Bounds Oaks Way, Tunbridge Wells, Kent, TN4 0UB, confirm that I am familiar with the English and German languages, and that to the best of my knowledge and belief the accompanying document which has been prepared by me, is a true translation of the authentic text of the Certificate of Priority Document on the filing of the Patent Application File No. 10 2004 035 271.2 dated 21st July 2004.<br><br><br>
Description<br>
The invention relates to a rotor brake for a spinning rotor of a rotor spinning machine according to the preamble of claim 1.<br>
In a known design of rotor spinning machines, the shaft of the spinning rotor is mounted in double-row roller bearings. The drive of a configuration of this type generally takes place by means of a tangential belt, which engages directly on the shaft of the spinning rotor. The bearing arrangement of the rotor shaft is clamped in a resilient damping sleeve, which is held in the rotor housing. The rotor housing is pivotably mounted on a housing part, which comprises the elements for the supply, opening and feed of the fibre material. The housing part itself is pivotably held on a stationary frame part of the rotor spinning machine and fixed by means of a lock in the spinning position required for the spinning process. To open the spinning box,<br>
the lock is released and the rotor housing and the housing part manually pivoted away from the spinning position. After a predetermined pivoting path, a projecting nose of a brake latch is hooked on the carrier plate of the machine part. The abruptly applied contact pressure of the nose of the carrier plate brings about a pivoting movement of the brake latch, which is consequently abruptly brought into contact by its brake lining with the rotor shaft and stops the rotation of the spinning rotor. This braking process prevents it being possible to reach into the spinning rotor which is running down but still rotating at a high speed, when the spinning box is open.<br>
In this opening or stop position, the brake latch holds the entire spinning box, and the spinning box is supported on the brake latch via the bearing shaft.<br>
A similar rotor spinning unit is described, for example in the generic DE 24 05 499 A. The bearing arrangement for the spinning rotor is held in a bearing shell. Arranged between the bearing arrangement and the bearing shell is a resiliently yielding<br>
2<br><br>
bearing ring, which prevents the occurrence of disturbing vibrations or running noise. In order to interrupt the drive of the spinning rotor and to bring the spinning rotor to a standstill, a housing part, in which the fibre supply device is arranged, is removed from a carrier, holding the bearing shell, of the spinning unit and the rotor<br>
shaft is lifted from the drive belt and brought into contact with a brake shoe. In order to be able to carry out this braking process, the housing part is rotatably mounted on a pivot pin of the housing frame of the spinning unit. If the housing part is manually pivoted about the pivot pin, a hook fastened to the bearing shell is engaged by a hook part arranged on the housing part of the spinning unit, so the bearing shell is pivoted, whereby the rotor shaft is abruptly brought into contact with a resiliency suspended brake shoe. There is a risk in the process that owing to the mass inertia of the moved module, the rotor shaft will be hurled too strongly against the brake device. The force peak occurring in the process is guided via the bearing arrangement. A loading of this type with sudden or abrupt forces, can lead to damage and even to the failure of rapidly running roller bearings. In the event of an impact of the bearing shell together with the bearing arrangement and spinning rotor on a stop, the pivoting movement of the bearing shell is abruptly braked. Owing to the mass inertia and the resiliency yielding bearing rings, the rotating part of the bearing arrangement and the spinning rotor itself continue to oscillate. A changing braking force is thus produced on the shaft of the spinning rotor. The braking force cannot be precisely predetermined and is reduced owing to the spring-back of the parts, which is caused by the impact, in the first phase of the braking process.<br>
In DE 24 05 499 A, a still further embodiment is described. In this further embodiment, the brake shoe of the braking device is manually operated in an additional operating step which is separate from the opening of the housing part and moved toward the shaft of the spinning rotor. In this introduction of the braking force which is decoupled from the opening of the housing part, there is a risk that it is possible to reach into the still running rotor.<br>
3<br><br>
The object of the invention is to improve the brake for a spinning rotor.<br>
This object is achieved with a rotor brake according to claim 1.<br>
The sub-claims are directed at advantageous configurations of the rotor brake.<br>
With the rotor brake according to the invention, an abrupt overloading of the bearing arrangement of the spinning rotor is ruled out. The movement of the rotor housing and lid element is stopped when the detent latch is hooked on a frame part of the rotor spinning machine in that the pivoting movement of the detent latch triggered by the hooking, is ended by the impacting of the detent latch on a stop of the rotor housing. The force flow does not take place via the bearing arrangement of the spinning rotor. In addition, both the opening of the spinning chamber by means of movement of the lid element and also the bringing to a standstill of the spinning rotor can be carried out with the same pivoting movement. Additional, separate operating steps are not required to bring the spinning rotor to a standstill. In this manner, it is always ensured that the spinning rotor is at a standstill when the spinning chamber is open and there can be no injury or endangering of the operator owing to the rapidly running spinning rotor.<br>
The spring constant of the spring can be selected and its arrangement and the arrangement of the stop of the detent latch implemented such that a braking force defined from the beginning can be exerted on the rotor shaft without a force peak. Damage to the bearing arrangement of the spinning rotor is reliably avoided.<br>
Configurations of the brake according to claims 2, 3 and 4 allow a compact and space-saving mode of construction.<br>
4<br><br>
A preassembled module according to claim 3 simplifies assembly and allows the exchange of a present, known brake latch for a detent latch according to the invention.<br>
Further details of the invention are described with the aid of the figures, in which:<br>
Fig. 1 shows a side view of a known spinning box in the spinning position in a simplified view<br>
Fig. 2 shows the spinning box of Fig. 1 in an open position in section,<br>
Fig. 3 shows a rotor brake according to the invention in section,<br>
Fig. 4 shows a simplified side view of a spinning box in the spinning position with a rotor brake according to Fig. 3,<br>
Fig. 5 shows the spinning box of Fig. 3 in section,<br>
Fig. 6 shows the spinning box of Fig. 4 in the braking position in section,<br>
Fig. 7 show a side view of the spinning box of Fig. 4 in the braking position.<br>
Figs. 1 and 2 show a known spinning box 1. A carrier plate 3 and a pivot tube 4 are fastened as parts of the frame to a cross-beam 2 of the rotor spinning machine. The lid element 5 contains structural elements for the fibre supply, the fibre opening and the fibre feed into the spinning rotor 6, and are not shown in detail in the figures. The spinning rotor 6 is mounted by means of a bearing arrangement 7, which comprises a resilient damping sleeve 8 and ball sets 9,10, in the rotor housing. The resilient damping sleeve 8 has support flanges 20, 21, on either side, with a slightly smaller diameter than the bore of the rotor housing 11. The support flanges 20, 21,<br>
5<br><br>
act as a limitation of the deflection of the bearing arrangement 7 under load. This should prevent the deflection producing an oblique position of the rotor shaft 12, in which the spinning rotor 6, for example, touches the feed and take-off nozzle, not shown for reasons of simplification and positioned at a slight spacing from the spinning rotor 6, and damage being caused thereby.<br>
The spinning rotor 6 can be made to rotate by means of a drive belt, which engages on the rotor shaft 12 of the spinning rotor 6. The spinning box 1 has a brake latch 14, which can engage on the free end of the rotor shaft 12. The brake latch 14 is pivoted away, in the view of Fig. 1, from the rotor shaft 12, and does not touch it. Owing to gravitational force, the brake latch 14 remains in this position as long as the spinning box 1 is not in the spinning position. The rotor housing 11 is pivotably connected to the lid element 5 by means of a pivot pin 15. The lid element 5 is in turn pivotably held on the pivot tube 4.<br>
Fig. 1 shows the known spinning box 1 in the spinning position, while Fig. 2 shows the spinning box 1 in the open or stop position. In order to reach the stop position from the spinning position, the lid element 5 and the pivot tube 4 in the view of Figs. 1 and 2 are pivoted in the clockwise direction about the pivot tube 4 and the rotor housing 11 is pivoted counter to the clockwise direction about the pivot pin 15 in a simultaneous movement by manual actuation. In the process, the lower side of the rotor housing 11 slides along the lower edge 16 of an opening 17 of the carrier plate 3, until the brake latch 14 impacts with the latch hook 18 on the carrier plate 3. Owing to the manual actuation, a force is applied in the direction of the arrow Fl, which, when the latch hook 18 impacts on the carrier plate 3, generates a counterforce in the direction of the arrow F2, with which the latch hook 18 is loaded. The latch hook 18 is made to pivot about the pivot pin 19, so the latch hook 18 is pressed with a braking force in the direction of the arrow F3 on the free end of the rotor shaft 12 and the spinning rotor 6 is brought to a standstill. The rotor shaft 12 is supported in the process on the ball sets 9,10 of the bearing arrangement 7.<br>
6<br><br>
It is conventional to carry out the opening manually. The movement carried out manually takes place in a relatively uncontrolled manner and the swinging movement imparted to the lid element 5 and the rotor housing 11 is not braked manually, or not sufficiently, prior to the contact of the brake latch 14 with the carrier plate 3.<br>
Consequently, the force indicated by the arrow F2 is exerted suddenly or abruptly, and there is an undesired, high force peak. The force flow extends, as described, via the ball sets 9,10 and the force peak leads to contact of the support flanges 20, 21 with the rotor housing 11. The high force acts substantially undiminished on the balls of the ball sets 9,10 and their tracks on the rotor shaft 12. The balls of the ball sets 9,10, and the tracks can therefore be damaged. This can lead to bearing failure and the resulting damage to other components of the spinning box 1.<br>
When the spinning chamber is open in the open position shown in Fig. 2, access to the spinning rotor 6 for cleaning purposes and other maintenance work is possible, unimpeded.<br>
Fig. 3 shows a part of a rotor brake 22 according to the invention in section. The rotor brake 22 comprises a detent latch 23 with a latch hook 31, latch stop 24 and brake lever stop 25 and a brake lever 26 with a brake lining 27 and the spring 28. In the view of Fig. 3, the spring 28 is configured as a U-shaped leaf spring. Alternatively, the spring may be configured, for example, as a double-sided wound leg spring. The brake lever 26 and detent latch 23 can be pivoted about the pivot pin 29. Fig. 3 shows the rotor brake 22 in the rest position. In this rest position, the brake lever 26 is pressed by the spring against a brake lever stop 25 limiting the path of the brake lever 26 and does not touch the rotor shaft 12 of the spinning rotor 6.<br>
7<br><br>
Figs. 4 and 5 show a spinning box, which differs from the spinning box in Fig. 1 and 2 substantially only in that it has a rotor brake 22 according to the invention instead of the known brake latch 14.<br>
In Figs. 4 and 5, the rotor brake 22 is shown in the rest position during the spinning process. The free end of the rotor shaft 12 rests, in this spinning position, on the drive belt 13 and is made to rotate thereby. In the spinning position, the brake lining 27 is pivoted away from the rotor shaft 12 and the latch stop 24 is pivoted away from the stop face 30 on the rotor housing 11. The detent, latch 23 together with the latch hook 31 is held in this position by the gravitational force. The brake lever 26, which carries the brake lining 27, is in the process pressed by the spring 28 onto the brake lever stop 25. The brake lever stop 25 is part of the detent latch 23 and limits the pivoting range of the brake lever 26, so the latter cannot touch the rotor shaft 12, as can be inferred from the sectional view of the spinning position in Fig. 5. The detent latch 23, the brake lever 26 and the spring 28 can be pivoted independently of one another about the common pivot axis 29.<br>
Fig. 6 shows the rotor brake 22 in the braking position. The lid element 5 and rotor housing 11 of the spinning box 1, after a pivoting movement about the pivot tube 4 or about the pivot pin 15, have adopted the open or stop position. The movement has been limited by the stop of the latch hook 31 of the detent latch 23 on the carrier plate 3.<br>
The counterforce, which acts on the impact of the latch hook 31 in the direction of the arrow F2, loads the detent latch 23 with a pivoting movement about the pivot pin 29, in the view of Fig. 6 and 7, counter to the clockwise direction. The pivoting path of this pivoting movement of the detent latch 23 is limited by the latch stop 24. The pivoting movement is stopped by the impacting of the latch stop 24 on the stop 30 of the rotor housing 11. As the counterforce is absorbed by the stop 30 of the rotor housing 11, the force flow does not take place via the bearing arrangement 7 even in<br>
8<br><br>
the event of a vigorous movement of the spinning box 1. The.brake lever stop 25, as it is part of the detent latch 23, has adopted a position closer to the rotor shaft 12 in accordance with the pivoting movement of the detent latch 23. The pivoting path, which the brake lever 26 can still cover in the direction of the brake lever stop 25, regardless of the detent latch 23, is now sufficiently long to allow the engagement of the brake lining 27 on the rotor shaft 12, without being kept therefrom by the brake lever stop 25. The spring 28 can be pivoted about the pivot pin 29, is supported on the detent latch 23, as shown in Fig. 6 and presses, by means of its predetermined limited spring force, the brake lever 26, which can be pivoted independently of the detent latch 23 about the common pivot pin 29, with the brake lining 27, onto the roller shaft 12. In this manner, the brake lining 27 only loads the rotor shaft 12 with a limited braking force in the direction of the arrow F3.<br>
The brake lever 26 is spaced apart in this position from the brake lever stop 25. In the event of an abrupt loading of the rotor shaft 12 with the braking force by means of the brake lever 26, any force peak occurring is substantially smaller than in known rotor brakes, as the mass, the momentum of which is to be braked via the rotor shaft 12, is formed substantially only by the brake lever 26 and the brake lining 27. This mass is extremely small compared to the mass of the lid element 5 and rotor housing 11. As only the braking force acting on the rotor shaft 12 loads the ball sets 9,10 of the bearing arrangement 7, the loading of the bearing arrangement 7 remains very small. Damage, which could lead to failure of the bearing arrangement 7 is avoided owing to the low centrifugal mass to be braked and the small braking force load.<br>
The rotor brake 22 is compact and space-saving. As shown in Figs. 3 to 7, it has, as a module, substantially the same dimensions as the known brake latch 14 shown in Figs. 1 and 2 and is arranged at the same position and is pivotable about the same pivot pin 15. The latch hook 31 of the rotor brake 22 according to the invention is located at the same position as the known rotor brakes of the latch hooks 18 of the<br>
9<br><br>
known brake latch 14. Therefore, the known brake latches 14 can be exchanged rapidly and simply for rotor brakes 22 according to the invention.<br>

ABSTRACT<br>
The rotor shaft of the spinning rotor of a rotor spinning frame is directly mounted in a rotor housing and can be braked down to standstill by means of a rotor brake that is configured as a shoe brake acting upon the rotor shaft. The spinning chamber surrounding the rotor cup of the spinning rotor is closed during spinning by means of a lid element articulated to the rotor housing. A detent latch (23) is mounted on the rotor housing so as to be swiveled and is articulated to a brake lever (26) carrying the brake lining (27) of the rotor brake (22). During spinning, the brake lining (27) is not in contact with the rotor shaft. When the spinning chamber is opened, the lid element and the rotor housing are swiveled simultaneously due to their articulated connection. The movement of the rotor housing is limited by a stop against a frame part of the rotor spinning frame. In the stop position, the brake line (27) of the brake lever (26) is pressed against the rotor shaft by means of a spring element. The inventive rotor brake (22) allows to avoid a sudden overload of the bearing of the spinning rotor.<br>
