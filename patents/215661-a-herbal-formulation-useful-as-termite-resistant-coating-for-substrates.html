				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a herbal  formulation useful as termite-resistant coating for substrates.<br>
The main use of the surface coating is to control termite attack on cellulosic building materials and masonry surfaces of buildings.<br>
Termites not only eat and destroy wood as generally believed but destroy all types of cellulosic and polymaric materials such as clothes, papers, carpets and plastics etc. They damage underground polymeric cables and pass through cement and mortar which may even.damage structures. In India only soil nesting (subterranean) termites are found and their workers move outside the soil in search of food (Y.Singh, Termite Control Measures in Buildings, Oxford and IBH Publishing Co., New Delhi, 1991 pp 1-19) .<br>
Cyclodiene hydrocarbons such as Aldrin, Chlordane and Heptachlor were used successfully for soil treatment for a long time to control termites in buildings. However, they were found highly toxic and environmentally toxic. Evidence were there that they are carcinogenic in character (R.Edwards and A.F. Mill, Termites in Buildings, Rentokil Ltd., East Grinstead (U.K.) 1986, pp 207-220). Therefore, they were banned around the world and also in India. Organophosforous compounds and synthetic pyrethroids are considered degradable in atmosphere but have sufficient persistence in the soil under the foundations.Chlorpy-rifos an organophosforous compound is recommended for use for soil treatment as per CBRI recommendations (Evaluation of chlor-pyrifos (Dursban 20 E.G. and Lentrek 50 E.G.) to control termites in buildings, CBRI report, June 1993, pp 1-33).<br><br>
It was considered worthwhile to develop the concept of Integrated Termite Management (ITM) for buildings in which minimum use of synthetic pesticides is recommended (Termite Management in Buildings, Ed. Y.Singh , Tata McGraw Hill Publishing Co.,1995, pp. 1-21). There is a good scope in ITM to explore the use of hebral pesticides to control termites in buildings.<br>
Rudman found that extractives namely Cudesmol and Azulene impart decay resistance to Cypress pine. (P. Rudman, Holzfor-schung,19: 52-57 (1965)). Tannins are the extractives found in wood and bark. Rowe and Conner showed that these compounds are detrimental to termites (Rowe, J.,W. and Conner, A.H., General Tech. Report, FPL 18, Forest Prod. Lab. Madison, WI (1979)). Harun and Labospy found red pine bark extractives less effective in termiticidal properties than white pine bark extractives (Harun, J. and Labosky, P., J. Wood and Fibre Science, 17(3), 3270325, July (1985)). Zaheer et al. reported the termite resistant properties in the extractives obtained from Pinus rox-burgii He studied the extracts from stems and leaves ofP. roxburgii(Zaheer, K. and Iqbal, H., Int. Pest Control 29:4, 87-89 (1987)). Naqvi reported the similar character of terpenes extracted from leaves and bark of Cedrus deodara (Naqvi, I., M.Phil. Thesis, Quaid-I-Azam Univ. Islamabad (1979)). Serit et al. reported that Citrus natsudaidai have antifeedant properties against termites (Serit M., Ishida M.and Kim Mujo, Agric. Biol. Chem., 55(9), 2381-2385, 1991).<br><br>
The literature survey reveals that no systematic research work seems to have been done to use herbal materials to control termites in buildings as coating. A coating is developed in Central Building Research Institute which is covered under this application to control termite in buildings, building components and furnishings. The raw materials used for this purpose are peels, leaves, bark, seeds and flowers of trees and plants such as Deodar, Chir, Chrysanthemum and neem. The extractives obtained from these plants were non-toxic and environmentally friendly thus obviating the main drawbacks of the synthetic chemicals known so far.<br>
The main objective of the present invention is to provide a herbal formulation useful for coating which obviates the drawbacks as detailed above. The coating developed is the only attempt known so far which is specifically for controlling termites in buildings.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a herbal formulation useful as termite resistant coating for substrates which comprises : herbal extract ranging from 10 to 25 % (w/w) and solvent (85 to 75 %).<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention the herbal extracts may be isolated from peels, leaves, bark, seeds, flowers and stem of chir, deodar, chrysenthemum and neem plants.<br>
The extract may be obtained from one plant and / or more than plant.<br>
In another emobodiment of the invention the solvents used may be organic and inorganic solvents such as acetone, ammonia, alcohol, chloroform, petroleum ether, water.<br><br>
The extracts  from the  raw materials may be prepared by known methods.<br>
The  main  steps   in  formulation of  the  coating  are  drying, crushing,    sieving,   mixing  with   solvent,   occasional   shaking, filtering,   solvent  removal   and  drying of  extract  as  per  conventional   methods.      Finally   it   is   mixed  with  thinner   (solvent)   to get  the  final product.<br>
The   following   examples   are   given  by way  of   illustration and   should   not   construed   the   limit   of   the   scope   of   the invention.<br>
Example  1<br>
Extact of Deodar bark and neem oil were treated in acetone in the ratio 2:3:20. Mango wood (Mangifera indica) blocks were treated with the final solution and the blocks were tested for termite attack. It was found that wooden blocks were damaged to the extent of 8.99 per cent.<br>
Example 2<br>
Extract of chir leaves in acetone and neem oil were reacted in ammonia solution (2:3:20). The final product was impregnated in mango wood blocks. It was found that the damage of the blocks was upto 19.99 per cent.<br>
Example 3<br>
Chrysanthemum leaves, and deodar bark were extracted in acetone. The extracts were allowed to react in ammonia solution in the ratio 2:3:20. Mango wood blocks were treated with the final product. When the treated blocks were exposed to termites, the<br><br>
damage was only 1.99 per cent.<br>
Example	IV<br>
10 gm. extract of chrysanthemum leaves was mixed with 100 gm. ammonia solution. The damage to mango wood treated blocks was 4.99 per cent.<br>
Example - V<br>
10 gm extract of chir leaves was diluted with 100 gms of acetone. The damage to mango wood treated blocks was 17.99 per cent.<br>
Example - VI<br>
Extracts of Deodar bark and chir leaves in the ratio 2:3 were mixed with 100 gms of petroleum ether (60Â° - 80Â°) . Mango wood blocks were treated with the composition. The damage to the blocks were to the extent of 5.8 per cent.<br>
Example - VII<br>
The  Mango  wood  blocks   were   treated  with  ammonia   and   acetone separately.   The  blocks  were   exposed  to  termite   attack.   It   was found that  the  damage was  100%. The main advantages of  the present  invention are   :<br>
(i)	Highly effective  to  control  termites<br>
(ii)	Non-toxic and eco-friendly<br>
(iii)	Easy   to   apply   on   cellulosic    and   masonary<br>
surfaces<br>
The formulation of the present invention is not a mere admixture but a synergistic mixture in which aggregate properties of the formulation are different from the properties of the individual ingredients.<br><br><br><br>
