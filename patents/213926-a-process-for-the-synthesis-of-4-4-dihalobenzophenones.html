This  invention relates to a process for the  synthesis of 4,4'-dihalobenzophenone-<br>
4,4'-dihalobenzophenone is used in the production of aromatic polyketone polymers having phenylene groups, oxygen atoms and ketone groups in their molecular chain. For example 4,4'-difluorobenzophenone is condensed with di(alkali metal) salts of aromatic bisphenols to form polyketones. Alternately 4,4'-difluorobenzophenone is condensed with aromatic bisphenols in the presence of alkali metal carbonates or bicarbonates to form polyketones-<br>
Hitherto     known    processes	of     synthesising<br>
4,4'dihalobenzenes are not satisfactory due	to many reasons.   In<br>
one    such    method,   halobenzene   is	reacted    with    P-<br>
halobenzoylchloride or phosgene.<br>
The reac tion wi th phosgene produces isomeric mi x tures which require further purification- The reac tan t p-^halo-benzoy 1 chloride used in the other process is very expensive* As such both the above referenced processes for synthesising 4,4-dihalobenzophenones are   not commerc ially acceptable,.<br>
Yet another process for synthesis of 4,4'-dihalobenzophenone is by the diazot ization of 4,4'*-diaminodiphenyl methane in anhydrous or concentrated aqueous hydrogen   fluoride.    Diazonium  fluoride  thus   produced   is<br><br>
subsequently decomposed in the presence of nitrous acid or nitrite ions- The product yield of this process depends on the concentration of HF. It is obvious that handling of concentrated HF poses problems in view of its high toxicity and corrosive nature. Further, the other reactant 4,4'-diaminodipheny1 methane is carcinogenous and large scale handling is a health  hazard-<br>
The present invention is aimed at developing a cheaper, easily   operable  and  safe  process  for   synthesising   4,4-dihalobenzophenones,   Yet another object is to avoid  production of isomers which requires further purification steps.<br>
Our investigation and research resulted in developing a simple process for the production of 4,4'-diohalobenzophenones in very good yield. The reactants involved in our process are cheaper and are readily available. Bulk handling for cornmercial production is also possible as these reactants BrB relatively safe and do not posses carcinogenic properties- Further the process affords recyclinq of the unreacted components to the reaction system, thereby minimising production loss -<br>
The process for the synthesis of 4,4'-dihalobenzophenone according to this invention comprises the steps of reacting halobenzene with carbon tetrachloride in the presence  of  anhydrous  Aluminum Chloride as a  catalyst,  steam<br><br>
distil 1ing said reaction mixture to remove unreacted reagents therefrom and separating 4,4'-dihalobenzophenone from the aqueous layer of said reaction mixture by known methods.<br>
Halobenzene reactant may be fluorobenzene, chlorobenzene or bromobenzene. The molar ratio of halobenzenes to carbon tetrachloride may vary from 2:4 to 2s7 and the reaction temperature may be in the range of 5 to 25^C. Reaction time may vary from 5 to 15 hours and the duration of steam distillation may be from 16 to 24 hours- The product can be separated from the reaction mixture by crystallization. Further purification may be effected by recrystallization from an organic solvent such as hexane, methanol or a mixture of the two in the presence of activated cation -<br>
The invention will now be described with reference to the following examples which arB only illustrative and non 1imitive.<br>
Example 1<br>
Synthesis     of     4,4'-difluorobenzophenone     from fluorobenzene and carbontetrachloride in the molar ratio of 2:5.<br>
180g of anhydrous aluminum chloride (1.35 mole) and 300ml of CCl^ (3.108 mole) were added into a 3 necked round bottom  flask  of  3  litre  capacity  fitted  with  stirrer  and<br><br>
thermowel1  while  maintaining the temperature   between  10-15°C using an immersion cooler with acetone bath.  After 15 minutes of stirring 26,16 ml of fluorobenzene 
About 900 ml disti1 led water was added to the reaction mixture drop by drop with stirring maintaining the temperature between 5-10^C« The reaction mixture was allowed to warm to room temperature after the addition was completed. Excess CCl^ was distil led off from the product by simple distillation on a water bath and then the reaction mixture was steam disti1 led for about 20 hours to remove the residual CCl^ and fluorobenzene and to hydrolyze the intermediate product. The aqueous layer was decanted and the light yellow solid was separated.<br>
The  product  was  recrystal1ized  from  an  0.75g   of activated charcoal and 1500 ml hexane mixture to yield lOlg (46*/.)<br><br>
white crystal line product of 4,4'-difluorobenzophenone; melting point 107°C- The structure of the product was confirmed by infra-red and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy.<br>
Example 2<br>
Synthesis     of     4,4'-dichlorobenzophenone     from chlorobenzene and carbon tetrachloride in the molar ratio of 2:5.<br>
180g  of  anhydrous aluminum chloride (1.35  mole)  and 300ml  of  CCl^  (3.108 mole) were added into a  3  necked  round bottom  f1 ask  of  3  1itre  capacity  fitted  with  stirrer  and thermowel1  while  maintaining the temperature   between  10-15^C using an immersion cooler with acetone bath.  After 15 minutes of stirring 26*26 ml of chlorobenzene (0.278 mole) was added drop by drop  through separatory funnel in about 10  minutes  maintaining the   temperature  between  lO^-lS^^C.   The   reaction   commenced immediately  and a mixture of 175.90 ml chlorobenzene (1.73  mole) and  180  ml  CCl ^^  (1.865 mole) was added  drop  by  drop  using separatory  funnel in about 2 hours maintaining  the  temperature between 5 and 10°C-  Stirring was continued for a further  period of  3  hours maintaining the temperature between 5-10°C  and  the reaction   mixture  was  allowed  to  stand  overnight  at   room temperature-<br>
About 900 ml distilled water was added to the  reaction<br><br>
mixture drop by drop with stirring maintaining the temperature between 5-10°C, The reaction mixture was allowed to warm to room temperature after the addition was completed. Excess CCl^ was distilled off from the product by simple distillation on a water bath and then the reaction mixture was steam distilled for about 20 hours to remove the residual CCl^ and chloroben^ene and to hydrolyzB the intermediate products The aqueous layer was decanted and the light yellow solid was separated.<br>
The  product  was  recrystal1ized  from  an  0.75g   of activated charcoal and 1500 ml hexane mixture to yield 106g (A2'/,) white  crystal 1ine product of 4,4'-dichlorobenzophenone;  melting point  145°  C.  The structure of the product was  confirnmed  by infra-red and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy.<br>
Obvious equivalents known to persons skilled in the art are not excluded from the scope of the appended claims.<br><br><br><br><br>
