FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to a contact arrangement,<br>
-	having a contact unit for production of an electricalconnection between a first<br>
contact, which is arranged in a fixed position on a withdrawable insert for a<br>
low-voltage switchgear assembly, and a second contact, which is arranged in<br>
a fixed position in the switchgear assembly, and<br>
-	having a means for movement of the contact unit from a disconnected<br>
position to a contact position and back,<br>
-	in which the contact unit has at least one contact element and at least one<br>
contact spring which prestresses the contact element in a sprung manner.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Moveable contact units such as these are being provided ever more frequently<br>
for withdrawable inserts of low-voltage switchgear assemblies, in order to make<br>
it possible to provide the various withdrawable-insert positions when the<br>
switchgear assembly door is closed and in order to make it possible in this way<br>
to guarantee a high level of personnel safety.<br>
The movement capability of the contact elements was in this case achieved in<br>
the past, for example, by moving the contact units and by using flexible cables to<br>
bridge the path-length difference to the first contact. This solution has the<br>
disadvantage that, particularly when the current levels are relatively high, the<br>
flexible cables occupy a relatively large amount of space. In addition, these<br>
flexible cables must be laid and fixed carefully, in order to avoid damage.<br>
The document DE 195 09 474 C2 discloses a contact arrangement which can be<br>
moved in a different manner, in which a	<br><br><br>
first contact surface of the contact element extends in such a manner that, during<br>
movement of the contact unit from the disconnected position to the contact position and<br>
back, it makes a sliding electrical contact with one of the contacts, and in which a<br>
second contact surface of the contact element extends in such a manner that, when the<br>
contact unit is located in the disconnected position, it is electrically disconnected from<br>
the other of the contacts, and when the contact unit is in the contact position, it makes<br>
electrical contact with the other of the contacts. - In this known contact arrangement,<br>
first contacts which are arranged in a fixed position on the withdrawable insert are in<br>
the form of rigid contact rails in order to be used not only for making electrical contact<br>
but<br>
also for mechanical guidance of a plurality of contact units. In this case, each of the<br>
contact units has two contact elements, which are prestressed against the contact rail<br>
by means of springs, with the springs being supported like rockers on a housing which is<br>
used as an opposing bearing, in order to mount the contact elements such that they can<br>
float. This floating mounting of the contact elements allows minor tolerance<br>
discrepancies with respect to the installation position of associated current busbars,<br>
which form the second contacts and whose contact planes run parallel to the contact<br>
planes of the contact rails.<br>
OBJECT OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is therefore an object of the invention to propose a contact arrangement in such a<br>
manner that it allows two contacts to be electrically connected whose contact planes run<br>
at right angles to one another.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
According to the invention, this object is achieved in that the first contact surface and<br>
the second contact surface on the contact element run at right angles to one another, in<br>
which case, in addition to one contact on which the contact element	<br><br><br>
slides, at least one stop element is provided, and has a stop surface which runs parallel<br>
to the second contact surface, and by means of which the contact element is<br>
mechanically guided.<br>
In a refinement such as this, the plane in which the second contact surface of the<br>
contact element runs, in contrast to the plane on which the first contact surface runs, is<br>
not defined by the position of the one of the contacts but by the position of the stop<br>
surface. The first contact does not contribute to the part for guidance of the contact<br>
element, which defines the plane of the second contact surface.<br>
One advantageous refinement of the novel contact arrangement provides for the at least<br>
one stop surface to be formed on the means for movement of the contact unit.<br>
In this case, by way of example, the stop surface may be formed on a guide pin, which<br>
passes through a recess in the contact element.<br>
It is advantageous for the at least one stop surface to be moveable at right angles to<br>
the second contact surface. - This allows the second contact surface to be moved to a<br>
desired plane in a mechanically simple manner. It is also advantageous that the entire<br>
contact unit can be moved in this way without any influence in the spring prestressing.<br>
A further advantageous refinement of the novel contact arrangement provides for the<br>
means for movement of the contact unit to have a lateral slide and a bearing body<br>
which forms the stop element, with the bearing body being held on the lateral slide such<br>
that it can be moved at right angles to the second contact surface of the contact<br>
element.<br><br><br>
- The guide pin may in this case be formed on the bearing body.<br>
For electrical connection of a plurality of the first contacts to a plurality of the<br>
second contacts, the invention provides for a plurality of the bearing bodies to be<br>
held on the lateral slide such that they can be moved.<br>
One preferred refinement of the novel contact arrangement provides for the<br>
contact element to be formed by a flat, U-shaped metal sheet. - In this case, the<br>
free ends of the U-shaped metal sheet may have a contact bulge on the mutually<br>
facing sides. In this case, one of the contact springs is preferably in the form of a<br>
U-shaped leaf spring, which prestresses the free ends of the U-shaped metal<br>
sheet with respect to one another in a sprung manner.<br>
The stop element can also be fixed in a fixed position with respect to the one of<br>
the contacts, and may have appropriate attachment elements for this purpose. -<br>
In this case, the contact element can be guided in a simple manner by the stop<br>
element having a guide strip. Two flat faces of this guide strip are in this case<br>
used as stop surfaces for at least two of the contact elements which are in the<br>
form of contact fingers, with each of the two contact fingers being prestressed<br>
against one of the stop surfaces by means of in each case one spring.<br>
The contact-making forces to be applied can advantageously be kept low by the<br>
guide strip being tapered at one of its ends, such that opposite contact fingers,<br>
which move along the strip, can be pivoted towards one another by the spring<br>
force.<br><br><br>
The stop element is preferably in the form of a plastic molding.<br>
With respect to a simple configuration and simple operation of the means for movement<br>
of the contact unit, it is advantageous for this to be held on the withdrawable insert -<br>
however, it may also be held on a frame of the switchgear assembly.<br>

DETAIL DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
A withdrawable insert 1, which is shown in Figures 1 and 2, for a low-voltage switchgear<br>
assembly 2 comprises a first embodiment of contact arrangements 3, of which only four<br>
are shown, although a total of eight are provided. The contact arrangements 3 are<br>
shown in the contact position in Figure 1, and in the disconnected position in Figure 2.<br>
As can be seen	<br><br>
flat metal sheets - and second contacts 5 - which are in the<br>
form of rails and may be composed of copper.<br>
As can be seen from Figure 3, the two flat metal sheets which<br>
form the first contacts are separated from one another by means<br>
of a spacer washer 6, and are prestressed with respect to one<br>
another by means of two leaf springs 7, in a sprung manner. The<br>
flat metal sheets which are provided with the leaf springs 7,<br>
the spacer washer 6 and a cable shoe 8 are connected via a<br>
screw connection 10 to form a first mechanical unit, and are<br>
held in a housing part 11 which is fixed in a fixed position on<br>
the withdrawable insert 1. In this case, the flat metal sheets<br>
have side projections 12, which engage in associated recesses<br>
13 (see Figure 4) in the housing part in an interlocking<br>
manner, in order to fix the first mechanical unit on the<br>
withdrawable insert.<br>
By way of example, a strip 14 with an H-shaped cross section<br>
can also be provided instead of the rail as the second contact,<br>
as is shown in Figures 4 and 5.<br>
The contact arrangements 3 comprise a contact unit, which is<br>
annotated 15 as an entity in Figure 3, and a means for movement<br>
of the contact unit, which is annotated 16 as an entity in<br>
Figure 1.<br>
The contact unit comprises a bearing body 17, two contact<br>
elements 18 and two contact springs 19. In this case, on the<br>
one hand, the first contacts are prestressed with respect to<br>
the contact elements 18 by the leaf springs 7. On the other<br>
hand, each of the two contact elements is prestressed with<br>
respect to the second contact 5 by in each case one of the<br>
contact springs 19 (see also Figure 3).<br><br>
As can be seen in particular from Figure 1, the means 16 for<br>
movement of the contact unit 15 has two tooth rods 20 which run<br>
transversely at the front in the withdrawable insert 1 and can<br>
be moved sideways by a pinion 21. In this case, a key can be<br>
used to engage in the pinion 21, via the front face, at the<br>
point of the arrow 22. Strips 24 are moved forwards and<br>
backwards over corner fillets 23. A lateral slide 25 which is<br>
coupled to the strips 24 is then likewise moved forwards from<br>
the rear, and vice versa.<br>
The contact unit 15 is guided by means of the lateral slide 25<br>
in its movement direction 26. For this purpose, the lateral<br>
slide 25 engages in a groove 27 on the lower face of the<br>
bearing body 17, which extends transversely with respect to the<br>
movement direction 26 over the entire width of the bearing body<br>
17. The bearing body 17 is thus mounted in a floating manner on<br>
the lateral slide 25 transversely with respect to the movement<br>
direction 26.<br>
As can be seen in Figure 3, each of the contact elements 18 is<br>
formed by a flat, U-shaped, slotted metal sheet, in which the<br>
ends of the two limbs 28 each have a convex-curved contact<br>
bulge 29 on the mutually facing sides, by means of which they<br>
rest on the second contact 5 in the contact position (see<br>
Figure 5). While the flat faces of the metal sheets form first<br>
contact surfaces 31 which are associated with the first<br>
contacts 4, the edges of the contact bulges 29 form second<br>
contact surfaces 32, which are associated with the second<br>
contacts 5 and 14, respectively.<br>
As can be seen in Figure 4, the two limbs 28 are prestressed<br>
with respect to one another in a sprung manner by means of the<br>
contact spring 19, which is curved in a U-shape and clasps the<br>
U-shaped metal sheet. The two limbs 28 each have an undercut,<br>
with the undercuts being located opposite one another in such a<br>
manner that<br><br>
they form a retaining opening 34 with an essentially<br>
rectangular cross section. A guide pin 35, which is integrally<br>
formed on the bearing body 17, passes through this retaining<br>
opening 34 in an interlocking manner, so that the contact<br>
element 18 is held in the bearing body 17 such that it cannot<br>
rotate. The bearing body is thus a stop element, on which the<br>
side surfaces of the guide pin which run parallel to the second<br>
contact surface form stop surfaces 36, on which the contact<br>
elements 18 rest in an interlocking manner, and are thus<br>
guided.<br>
As can be seen in Figures 4 and 5, in a disconnected position<br>
(see Figure 4), the first contact 4 extends essentially along<br>
the entire length of the first contact surface 31 of the<br>
contact element 18. In this case, a first contact 4 which are<br>
in the form of a flat metal sheet, each have contact studs 37<br>
(see Figure 3) on the side facing the first contact surface 31,<br>
via which they make a continuous electrical contact with the<br>
first contact surface 31. The contact unit 15 can be moved from<br>
the disconnected position - in which the contact elements 18<br>
are electrically disconnected from the second contacts 5 - to a<br>
contact position as shown in Figure 5 - in which the second<br>
contact surface 32 rests on the second contacts 14 subject to a<br>
spring force, and thus makes electrical contact. In this case,<br>
the first contacts 4 have an aperture slot 38, which is broader<br>
than the guide pin 35. The first contacts 4 are also narrower<br>
than the unobstructed internal width 39 of the bearing body 17,<br>
so that the lateral guidance of the contact elements 18 is not<br>
influenced by the position of the first contacts 4.<br><br>
Figures 6 to 10 show a further embodiment of the novel contact<br>
arrangement.<br>
In Figure 6, the second embodiment of the novel contact unit is<br>
annotated 40 as an entity, although only the lateral slide 43<br>
of the means 41 for movement of the contact unit 42 is shown,<br>
since all the other elements essentially correspond to those in<br>
the first embodiment. In contrast to the first embodiment, the<br>
lateral slide 43 is in this case fitted with cylindrical pins<br>
44, by means of which the contact unit 42 is moved.<br>
The contact unit 42 comprises six contact elements 45 in the<br>
form of contact fingers, two contact springs 46 and a clamping<br>
frame 47. The two contact springs 46 are in this case each in<br>
the form of a leaf spring, and each have three fingers 48,<br>
which are each associated with one of the contact fingers, at<br>
both ends. The clamping frame 47 clasps the contact fingers and<br>
the leaf springs in such a manner that mutually opposite<br>
contact fingers are prestressed with respect to one another in<br>
a sprung manner.<br>
Six first contacts 49 which are formed by flat metal sheets<br>
that are curved like tulips in pairs pass through window-like<br>
openings in a stop element 50. The metal sheets each have two<br>
contact studs 51 on the sides facing the contact fingers. These<br>
contact studs 51 rest against first contact surfaces 53 of the<br>
contact fingers, subject to the force of a spring 52, from a<br>
disconnected position to a contact position. On the side facing<br>
a second contact 54, the contact fingers have contact bulges<br>
55, whose edges form second contact surfaces 56.<br><br>
The metal sheets which form the first contacts 49, the spacer<br>
washers 57 and a cable shoe 58 are jointly connected to the<br>
stop element 50 via a screw connection 59 to form a second<br>
mechanical unit, and are held in a housing part 61 which is<br>
fixed in a fixed position on the withdrawable insert 60. In<br>
this case, the stop element 50 has attachment elements 62 in<br>
the form of lateral projections, which engage in an<br>
interlocking manner in associated recesses 63 in the housing<br>
part 61, in order to fix the second mechanical unit to the<br>
withdrawable insert.<br>
The contact unit 42 can be moved from the disconnected position<br>
as shown in Figures 7 and 8 - in which the contact elements 45<br>
are electrically disconnected from the second contacts 54 - to<br>
a contact position as shown in Figure 10 - in which the second<br>
contact surfaces 56 rest on the second contacts 56 subject to a<br>
spring force, and thus make electrical contact. In this case,<br>
the housing part 61 has aperture slots 64 for the cylindrical<br>
pins 44, which are broader than the cylindrical pins. The<br>
cylindrical pins 44 pass through aperture openings in the<br>
contact elements 45 and in the clamping frame 47 for movement<br>
of the contact unit 42. In this case, the lateral guidance for<br>
the contact elements 45 is provided by a guide strip 65, which<br>
is integrally formed on the stop element and whose two flat<br>
faces - which run parallel to the second contact surface - form<br>
stop surfaces 66 for three of the contact elements in each<br>
case. In this case, three contact elements 45 in each case<br>
rest, subject to the force of the springs 46, on in each case<br>
one of the stop surfaces 66 of the guide strip 65.<br>
As can be seen in Figure 9, which shows an intermediate<br>
position of the contact unit, the guide strip 65 is designed to<br>
be slightly tapered on its side facing the second contact, and<br>
has two inclines 67. The contact bulges 56<br><br>
slide along these inclines 67, as a result of which the contact<br>
elements 45 are moved towards one another on both sides of the<br>
guide strip 65, during which process they slide on the<br>
associated contact surfaces 68 of the second contacts 54 during<br>
this pivoting movement, in order in this way to reach the<br>
contact position as shown in Figure 10.<br>
In both embodiments of the novel contact arrangement, the stop<br>
elements 17 or 50 may be in the form of a plastic molding.<br><br><br>
