This invention relates to a composite, which is comprised of a substrate body with a coating of one or more layers of carbides, nitrides, carbonitrides of Ti, Zr, Hf, Nb, V or Ta and or of aluminium oxide or zirkonium oxide.<br>
Fundamentally, as well known as per the current state of the technology coatings of titanium carbide of thickness of 8 microns having enable an improved wear resistant against flank wear. Further the double or multiple coating of TiC and TiN especially with TiN as outer coating also are the state of technology whereby reduced crater wear in the cutting devices achieved during metal cutting operations. To further improve such cutting devices multi layered coatings with layer sequence TiC (C, N)-TiN have been proposed. After coming to know the natural brittleness of ceramics like aluminium oxide can be minimized when aluminium in thin layers an outer coating is used also along with TiC and Ti (C, N) in multi layered coating. Though in the patent literature has eg. in reference to special coating process referred in EP 0 229 282 Bl speaks in general of carbides, nitrides, and or carbonitrides of the elements titanium, zirkonium, hafnium, vanadium, niobium and or tantalum, they are restricted to the above described examples of titanium alloys as coating material to some extent in combination with aluminium oxide. The same applied to zirkonium oxide, which is used in combination or as replacement of oxides containing coatings. For the first time in the DE 36 20 0 901 Al or EP 0 250 865 Al which is similar content is a cutting tool described whose cutting edge is constituted of TiC, TiCN or TiN coating and whose outer fmal coating is of thin zirkonium nitride. The zirkonium nitride which has poor resistant than the above mentioned titanium alloys prevents the oxidation of the basic layers beneath this coating, through the oxygen in the air, thereby a good wear resistance properties of TiN, TiCN coatings are fully retained. In the practice however zirkonium alloys have not been used as a coating material,<br>
The objective of this invention is to offer a composite body which is composed of a single or multi layer coated substrate whose wear resistant properties while metal cutting or any other abrasive with a view to provide an extended tool life.<br><br>
This objective is achieved through the composite body as per claim 1, wherein the single<br>
or the outer coating is of zirkonium carbonitride and is of thickness minimum two<br>
microns upto maximum 6 microns. The manufacture of these composite bodies are<br>
described in the following claims.	y<br>
This invention thus provides a composite body comprising a substrate (12) with a single or multi layered (13-16) of carbides, nitrates, carbonitrides of Ti, Zr, Hf, Nb, V or Ta and or of aluminium oxide or zirkonium oxide wherein the single or the outer coating (16) is made up of zirkonium carbonitride and is of thickness minimum 2\i upto a maximum of 6\i.<br>
In order to make multi layered coatings of aluminium oxide and or zirkonium oxide is made beneath the outer layer of zirkonium carbonitride. This oxide has thickness of minimum two microns preferably 3 microns which must be present in the cutting devices on the cutting edges. The total thickness of the two outer coatings of aluminium oxide and or zirkonium oxide on one hand and zirkonium carbonitride on the other hand should be minimum 5 microns or can be maximum 10 microns. Extra ordinary good wear resistance properties can be achieved with a multi layered coatings in which underneath the outer zirkonium carbonitride coating as well as wear applicable mentioned alimiinum or zirkonium oxide coating, a single or multi layers of carbides, nitrides, carbonitrides of the elements of 4A, 5A group of periodic table are arranged. The sequence of the coatmgs within the zirkonium carbonitride coating layer as well as zirkonium oxide and aluminium oxide coating can be basically chosen at will, however, it is preferable that carbide, nitride and or carbonitride of titanium, zirkonium or hafnium are used especially in the form of coatings in the sequence from inside out of titanium nitride, TiCN, aluminium oxide and zirkonium carbonitride on the substrate and the following coating thickness are preferred.<br><br>
I       ' i ^  J<br><br>
As yet another part of invention the substrate of the body consists of hard metal, cermet, or ceramic material. The substrate body hard metal can for eg. consist of a centered titanium carbide having 5.5 - 8.5% by weight cobalt preferably 5.5 - 6.5% by weight cobalt. Alternatively the substrate body can consist of 1 - 3% by wt. Titanium carbide, 2 - 5% by wt. Tantalum carbide; 1-3% by wt. of NbC, 5.5 - 8.5% by wt. Cobalt, rest tungsten carbide.<br>
To manufacture the above mentioned coatings as well as the sequence of coating, the state of art technology of CVD and or PCVD process will be relied upon preferably the carbonitride coating should be applied as per CVD process while using Acetonitril as the C-M donor.<br>
As already mentioned the composite bodies will be developed as cutting device for metal cutting device for metal cutting or as a wear part subjected to abrasion. In a concrete example the substrate body is made of tungsten carbide consisting of 6% cobalt as binder on which from inside out the following coatings in the specified thickness were applied. 1^1 TiN; 10)0, TiCN; 4 \i AI2O3 and 3^ ZrCN as the outer layer. These composite bodies developed as cutting device for machining (milling, drilling or turning) provides tool life depending upon the cutting condition 1,2-4 times longer compared to multi layered coated composite material which are known under the state of technology and consisted of either TiN, AI2O3 or ZrN as outer coatings.<br>
In the accompanying drawings. Fig. 1 shows the cutting device (10) whose cutting edge (11) has been shown with a section line A-B in Fig 2 schematically.<br>
As can be seen from fig.2, first layer (13) of In TiN and a second layer (14) of lOfx thickness of TiCN and additional 4|x thickness (15) of AI2O3 and an outer layer (16) of 3)4, thick final coating of ZrCN are applied over a substrate (12) of tungsten hardmetal with 6% cobalt as binder.<br><br>
As can be seen from the following experiments the indexable insert coated as per the invention has given pronounced longer tool life against the indexable insert of the current state of technology.<br>
